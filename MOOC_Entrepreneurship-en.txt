Never thought that Marco Polo would be such a nice guy.
Yeah really.
Oh look who's there,
I think it's MOOC time again.
Due to the popularity of the course, we thought it would be a good idea to do a re-run.
That's right this five weeks course is gonna cover topics ranging from identifying and evaluating business opportunities to entrepreneurial marketing.
And we will also talk about raising and managing money, value creation, value capture, profiting from your innovation and we also made a few changes.
That's right! This year we're going to move to a new on-demand model so you can watch the video lectures, take the quizzes and exams all at your own pace, whenever you like.
And we will be including a new set of videos from entrepreneurs
That give you additional insights on the topics covered in this course
Plus, as an additional benefit, we are again proud to offer
2,500 dollars in seed funding for the top 3 performers of this course.
Join us from 16th of September 2016 for the new and improved MOOC
"Launching New Ventures"
Hey, speaking of new and improved,
I made some slight modifications to the time machine that we wrote at the end of last course
-Oh really you did ?
-Yes, sir.
-That's exciting!
-Right over there...
So 16th of Septembre 2016, we'll wait for you there!
See you in the future!
