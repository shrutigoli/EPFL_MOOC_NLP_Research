Welcome to the exercises for the second week of the course on plasma physics and applications.
In this week's exercises we will look in more detail at the connected description of the two-stream instability that is the instability that develops when two counterstreaming beams interact.
You will first study the linear stability criteria of this problem and use [unclear] to plot the dispersion relation.
You will then run a particle-in-cell code to calculate the nonlinear evolution of this instability and you will compare the results with the linear stability calculation.
As part of a bonus exercise, you will then have access to the entire particle-in-cell code with the goal of calculating the time evolution of the momentum and of the total energy of the system.
If you are really stuck somewhere, after the final submission, you can look at the solution.
This should then allow you to continue with the rest of the exercise.
I wish you good luck.
