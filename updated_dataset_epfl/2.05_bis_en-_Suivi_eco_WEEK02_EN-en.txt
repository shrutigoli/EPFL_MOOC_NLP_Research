In this unit we saw how to use a variable distribution as observed within the sample to try to deduce the variable or ecological attributes distribution at the scale of the population.
For a quantitative variable, such as the age of elephants let's take a sample of which the histogram of age distribution in five year beams would be as follows.
By increasing the sample size we can reduce the beam width to three years for example and be more accurate.
Then we try to identify a curve representing the law of population that can be expressed by a relatively easy statistical function.
For discreet variables we don't want to replace the histogram with the curve, since the values are distributed into separated beams but we could, however, determine the law of the population.
In all cases, the difficulty is to identify a suitable formula that depends on unknown parameters that one would need to estimate.
This is where the sample comes in handy as it allows choosing sensibly the most treatable model to describe the population and to calculate the value of the parameter on which the model is based.
One way of doing it is to consider the sample distribution to find the law that comes nearest to it.
Here for example we took the normal law.
Determining the value of the parameters isndone by estimating the value from the sample.
In this case, we're allowed to identify the values of the standard deviation and the mean and their degree of confidence.
We will see these in more detail in the next unit.
The benefit of this type of model is that it can give precious information in theory.
For example, that 95% of individuals will fall in two standard deviations and 99% in three standard deviations provided of course the population follows the model in place.
