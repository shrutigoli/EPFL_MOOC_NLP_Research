Welcome to our MOOC, our Massively
Online Open Course on Basic Steps in Magnetic Resonance.
Today, we shall be talking about chemical exchange.
That is the subject of chapter 4 of Peter Hore's book.
The author has chosen an example of chemical exchange for the title page of his book so it is safe to assume that he found this subject particularly interesting.
Like many other basic aspects of magnetic resonance, the effects of chemical exchange were discovered in the 1950s.
The name of Herbert Gutowsky is often associated with this discovery.
The theory was developed by
Felix Bloch and Harden McConnell.
As we shall see, chemical reactions that occur during the observation of NMR spectra lead to characteristic effects: line broadening, coalescence, and line narrowing, all of which allow us to determine the rates of reactions.
Typically, one can study rates that are comparable with differences in chemical shifts.
The range of applications is truly staggering.
From simple conformational equilibria, to internal mobility of biomolecules such as proteins.
So, the word â€œchemical exchangeâ€� has a particular meaning for
NMR spectroscopists which is not shared by the entire community of chemists.
To explain this point, let's consider some simple examples.
All of us, in first year chemistry, must have learned that cyclohexane normally looks like this, if it is drawn as a static molecule, and that we have protons, or generally speaking, substituents sticking out from the ring in axial positions and other ones that are in equatorial positions.
Now, we also know that these can interchange to give another conformation which again has axial and equatorial positions.
Now, what is curious is that, in the static molecule, if we could stop it from exchanging, we would expect a different chemical shift for the axial position and the equatorial position.
One would expect them to have different chemical shifts.
Let's not talk about the fact that they are also coupled, which is not of interest here.
Now it turns out that the chemical shift of the axial proton will be transformed into the chemical shift of an equatorial proton.
Whereas the equatorial proton will find itself in the position of an axial proton. Consequently there is an interchange between their chemical shifts.
It turns out that this process is extremely fast and therefore difficult to measure with NMR, unless we find some way of slowing it down, which is actually still a topic of interest.
I can take another example, of a true chemical reaction.
Let's consider some carboxylic acid, which looks like this in the acid form.
And we have all learned that this can be transformed into the conjugate base by giving a proton to the environment.
Now if we think of this carbon-13, we can expect its chemical shift to be different from the chemical shift in the conjugate base.
And indeed it is.
Again, such a process tends to be very fast, and therefore not easy to measure by NMR.
But it turns out that such processes can be slowed down considerably.
For example, if this carboxylic acid is hidden in the heart of a protein, if it belongs to the side-chain of a protein, to one of the amino-acids in the protein, the exchange can be slowed down and can become measurable, which is of great interest to NMR spectroscopy.
Now, in order to support this whole discussion of chemical exchange,
I invite you to look at chapter four of
Peter Hore's book on
Nuclear Magnetic Resonance.
You will see that he distinguishes symmetrical two-site exchange and un-symmetrical two-site exchange.
We shall see what the difference is.
In this chapter, there is a great wealth of interesting examples that I will take some time to discuss with you.
Let's first talk about symmetrical exchange, which is an exchange with equal populations.
Equal populations you will have if the two forms in equilibrium have the same energy.
So, if the energy is drawn as a function of the degrees of freedom, it turns out that you have the same energy for the A and B forms.
If that is so, then the populations will be equal, according to
Boltzmann's Law, and also the interconversion from A into B will be precisely matched by the reverse interconversion from B into A.
Such systems are very numerous.
Ee have for example dimethylnitrosamine, where there are two distinct methyl groups, a methyl group which is on the same side as the oxygen or â€œcisâ€�, and another methyl group, which is on the opposite side or â€œtransâ€�, with respect to the oxygen.
There can be a pseudo-rotation about this single bond (or partly single bond), so that the oxygen will go to the other side, and the methyl that was in the cis position now ends up in the trans position
Therefore they can be labelled like this.
The point is that while this pseudo-rotation is going on, the methyl groups change their environments, and in doing so change their chemical shifts.
Because the energies of these two conformers or rotamers are exactly the same, the populations are the same and therefore we have a symmetrical situation where the forward and backward exchange rates are exactly the same. We can write theme as k+ which is equal to k-. 
We can also write the equilibrium constant K, which in this case is equal to 1.
Now, in this particular case, where we have equal populations, we can distinguish different regimes.
This picture is on the title page of the first edition of Peter Hore's book.
First of all, it shows the spectra that we see as a function of the exchange rate.
You will note that this is a logarithmic scale, for example, this corresponds to one jump per second, while this corresponds to a thousand jumps per second, and of course we can go all the way to 100,000 per second.
This corresponds, generally speaking, to an increasing temperature.
There are other ways, of course, of changing the speed of a chemical reaction, but temperature is certainly one way of doing it.
At low temperatures we have slow rates, and at slow rates we can actually distinguish the chemical shifts of site A and site B as we have in previous examples.
In these simulations, they happen to be separated by a difference in chemical shifts that is
50 Hz and which elsewhere is called delta nu, with a lower case delta.
So that's the abstract notation for the difference in chemical shifts delta nu is equal to nu zero of site B minus nu zero of site A.
Now, what is interesting is that if we increase the temperature or otherwise increase the interchange rate, then the lines begin to broaden, and more surprisingly they tend to move closer together.
It turns out that the distance between these broad humps is smaller than the distance between the two narrow peaks at low temperature.
They get broadened to the point that we see almost no signal and then they turn up as a single hump, the two lines appear merged together into a single hump, a phenomenon that we call â€œcoalescenceâ€� in our trade.
More remarkably, the single line, which is initially rather broad, will become narrower and narrower as the exchange rate increases, while at the same time, we end up with an average chemical shift which is simply half-way between the two chemical shifts of the separate sites.
Aat the low temperature end, the line-broadening effects are due to slow exchange.
Before we speak of line-broadening, we have to define what exactly we mean by the width of a line.
There are actually several definitions in the literature but this is the one that we shall use.
The height of the line, the peak height, will be called H, and can be divided by two. Next we measure the width in Hz at the half of the height of the line.
This quantity we call delta nu, nu being the Greek letter that is used for frequencies. The line width is simply proportional to the exchange rate k divided by the factor pi.
Since the exchange rate k is nothing else but the inverse of the lifetime of a particular conformer, or molecular form, we can substitute that into this equation, and come to the conclusion that the line width delta nu is equal to one over pi times tau, tau being the lifetime.
Thus, the line width can be rationalized in terms of the lifetime of the states.
Remember that a transition in NMR is always between a ground state and an excited state, but at the beginning we have discussed these as stationary states that have an infinite lifetime.
In fact, if the molecule doesn't exist for very long, the states don't exist very long either, and they get blurred.
The shorter the lifetime, or the faster the exchange, the more severe the blurring.
On the left hand side, they are only slightly blurred and therefore the line is fairly narrow.
But in this case the blurring is quite severe, the differences in energy is also blurred and therefore the line becomes very broad.
This is a hand-waving way of explaining line-broadening.
There are, of course, more satisfactory ways of explaining the same thing.
So, for a two-site problem with equal populations and equal forward and backward reaction rates, we have the following three distinct regimes:
In the slow exchange regime, we simply have line-broadening which is the same for both A and B resonances, and in both cases is simply proportional to the exchange rate k, or if you prefer, inversely proportional to the lifetime of either of these molecules, or conformers.
In the fast exchange rate, we have an entirely different situation.
In this case, the line width is inversely proportional to the exchange rate.
That means that the faster the exchange rate, the narrower the line.
Furthermore, there is a very important parameter.
The parameter delta nu is, as before, the difference in chemical shifts.
And as you can see, it comes as a square.
Now that's very important because that means that the residual line width will be proportional to the square of the difference of the chemical shifts.
And this difference in chemical shifts is, among other things, proportional to the magnetic field into which we immerse our sample or molecule.
Consequently if we go from, say, a 400 MHz spectrometer to an 800 MHz spectrometer, that is to say, if we double the field, then we also double the difference in chemical shifts, and we therefore quadruple the square, that is to say the line width becomes four times broader.
This is one reason why chemists and physical chemists like to have spectrometers with different fields in their laboratories.
You can also convert this equation by saying that the line width, apart from the square of the difference in chemical shifts, is directly proportional to the lifetime of the states.
As we mentioned, there is a critical condition called â€œcoalescenceâ€�.
In fact, that's the precise point where the three extrema of these curves merge into a single extremum, a single maximum,
It turns out that this occurs when the exchange rate is precisely
2.2 times the difference in chemical shifts.
This equation is of limited usefulness, because in the vicinity of coalescence, the lines are often so broad that you can barely see them, let alone decide whether they have merged or not quite yet.
We have discussed chemical exchange between two sites that have equal populations because they have equal energies.
The discussion can be broadened to encompass the more general case where the populations are unequal.
Here we have a case where we have the same methyl group, but here we have replaced one of the methyl groups by a benzyl group which has CH2 attached to a phenyl ring.
And so these are clearly unequal and therefore you would expect the molecule to have different energies depending on whether the oxygen is pointing to the same side as the methyl or to the opposite side.
And indeed, the energies are quite different between these two forms and therefore the populations are going to be different. So there will be more molecules in the lower energy state than in the upper energy state.
We can also say that the likelihood that we move from left to right is faster, the exchange rate is higher than the other way around.
So this situation means that k_AB is different from k_BA.
This will have some consequences on the spectra.
When the populations are unequal, this has dramatic consequences on the exchanging spectra.
Here we have a case where the minor isomer A has about half the concentration of the major isomer B, but they still have distinct chemical shifts.
In this case, the simulations refer to a difference of 50 Hz this is again delta, which is nu zero A minus nu zero B and as you can see, when the exchange process begins to be felt, the minor isomer broadens actually more than the major isomer.
Furthermore, they tend to coalesce and then narrow, as in the case before, but the narrowed line is not positioned halfway between the two chemical shifts, but displaced towards the major isomer.
In fact, the rule is very simple, the average chemical shift is a weighted linear combination, or a weighted average between the two chemical shifts, with the population of the minor isomer and the population of the major isomer which are the weights of the two chemical shifts.
Remember that the sum of the two populations is defined to be one, because they are probabilities of occupation.
As you can imagine, if the major isomer becomes very dominant, the minor isomer becomes negligible and the average line will be essentially indistinguishable from the position of the major isomer. It becomes therefore difficult to determine exchange effects.
It turns out that this is quite a modern picture.
I guess it was first drawn in the '50s but there has been recent work on proteins where one can now distinguish the dominant major conformation of a protein, and a minor conformation which might be activated, perhaps the conformation that allows the protein to work as an enzyme or to have a fruitful interaction with its substrate.
This kind of argument is now used, not only for protons but also for nitrogen-15 and carbon-13 in proteins.
It turns out to be a very powerful way to identify mobility of macromolecules.
If the populations are unequal, as opposed to the equal case we treated before, then there are two different line-broadening effects.
The line width of site A becomes inversely proportional to the lifetime of A and the line width of site B is inversely proportional to the lifetime of B.
If site B is dominant, then its lifetime will be longer and therefore its line width will be smaller.
If this is a minor conformer, then tau A will be short and therefore its width larger.
Furthermore, we have this average population which is weighted by the populations.  This is a somewhat more scary equation where we have the residual line width in the high temperature limit in the fast exchange limit.
Much like in the case of a symmetrical exchange it is still proportional to the square of the difference in chemical shifts and therefore, if we double the field, this delta nu parameter will be multiplied by a factor of four, like before.
Furthermore, we see that we have p_A and p_B, the populations and the sum of the two exchange rates, the forward and the backward exchange rate.
Of course, this should converge to a simple equation if we take p_A and p_B to be one half each.
To summarize the first part of chapter 4, we have discussed the pictures that serve as front cover for Peter Hore's book, and we have discussed the fact that if there are two isomers with two different molecular forms, or two partners in a chemical reaction that have different chemical shifts, then these lines will be broadened by chemical exchange and the broadening can go as far as coalescence, and beyond to line narrowing at an average position.  The line widths of these different spectra can be used to extract the chemical exchange rates, which are, of course, of great interest to chemists and physical chemists alike.
