...amount of precipitation we can measure.
Then if the precipitation measurement exceeds a certain limit then there might be a risk of landslide and in that way we can issue some early warning system.
We can tell the community people then make some arrangement regarding the early warning system so that they can inform other communities that, "Oh, there is a chance of landslide so we should prepare."
Dear participants, welcome to chapter 4 of the MOOC
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology for Disaster Risk Reduction.
In this chapter, we will present how science and technology are used for early warning and preparedness.
And through the online forum we will exchange information and knowledge about appropriate technologies for prevention and preparedness.
Some of the questions that will be addressed are the following:
How can science and technology help people to be better prepared?
How are science and technology used for risk communication?
What are early warning systems?
The topics of this chapter are presented through lectures and interviews.
Many of the interviews were carried out during the UNESCO Technologies for Development Conference:
From Innovation to Social Impact that took place at EPFL in May, 2016.
After watching the videos, we invite you to participate in the first discussion forum of this MOOC on science and technology for prevention and preparedness.
We would like to invite you to share and exchange your experience with us and the other participants, as this will help all of us to increase and further disseminate knowledge on DRR.
