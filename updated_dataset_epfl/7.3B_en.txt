Now how are UV photons used ?
There are several reasons.
First, they allow a better energy resolution of the electrons in the CHA.
Perhaps most importantly, because the energies of UV photons are close to that of valence-band-electron binding energies, the absorption cross-section of UV photons is large.
The reference binding energy of 0 eV is defined as the Fermi energy, that is, the energy of the highest occupied state of the system at
0 K. Note that this depends on the direction of the electron momentum with respect to the crystal structure.
Note also, that E_F is lower than the vacuum energy, the energy of a free electron having zero kinetic energy, by an amount equal to the work function.
This leads us on to the concept of the Fermi surface, that is, the plot in reciprocal, or momentum, space of the Fermi energy, in other words, as a function of the wavevector k of the electron. k has three components k_x, k_y, and k_z.
Not surprisingly, the Fermi energy changes according to which direction the electron is moving through the crystal, depending on the interaction between it and the ionic electrostatic potential in that direction.
Even for the most simple elemental metals such as copper, the Fermi surface can assume complex forms, as shown here.
To understand this 3D-plot a little better, we make a slice through the Fermi surface, for which the cross-section is shown on the right.
The centre, which has zero momentum, is called the Î“-point, while the two crystallographic directions (111) (denoted â€˜Lâ€™) and (100)
(â€˜Xâ€™) are also shown.
Letâ€™s consider this more closely.
We look along the Gamma-L and Gamma-X directions
The Fermi surface never crosses the Î“â€“L line and in this direction all the states are below the Fermi energy and therefore a gap opens up between the occupied states and unoccupied states.
In contrast, in the Î“â€“X direction, the
Fermi surface crosses the Fermi energy, and copper is thus conducting in this direction.
Angle-resolved PES, or ARPES, attempts to determine the electron kinetic energies as a function of angle.
With this information, the electronsâ€™ momenta p_x, p_y, and p_z can be accessed, which should lead to a complete picture of the electronic structure.
Synchrotron radiation provides two further variables excluded to lab-based ARPES experiments, namely the possibility of tuning the incident photon energy, and the possibility of varying the polarisation.
The momenta in plane in the k_x and k_y directions for a given electron binding energy below the Fermi energy can be plotted in a Fermi surface map, or FSM, as we have already met in the previous slides on the Fermi surface of copper.
Alternatively, one can plot the binding energy as a function of the electron wavevector in a given direction, in a momentum-distribution curve, or MDC.
For a fixed k-value, the intensity as a function of energy can be plotted in an energy-distribution curve.
These two plots can be combined in a two-dimensional map called the energy-distribution map.
Finally, all these plots can be combined in a 3-D plot, shown on the right, from which any planar section can be viewed.
Ultraviolet photoelectron diffraction (UPD) and x-ray photoelectron diffraction (XPD) are techniques used to obtain direct structural information in the neighbourhood of the photoelectron emitter in single crystals.
The techniques depend on the strong forward-scattering nature of photoelectrons by neighbouring atoms, particularly for the higher kinetic energies found in XPD, which thus delivers sharper data than UPD.
UPD and 
XPD are now an established and invaluable tools for investigating surface absorbates and heteroepitaxial thin films on single crystals.
In an XPD experiment, the outgoing photoelectron wave can reach an electron detector on a direct path or can be scattered by the atoms surrounding the emitter.
The intensity measured at the detector is given by the interference of the direct and the scattered wave parts and changes as a function of emission direction (theta_s in the figure on the left), or electron kinetic energy.
These modulations can be used to determine the local structure around the emitter.
Prediction of the angular distribution of the signal in photoelectron diffraction is much simplified by the well-known phenomenon of the enhanced forward elastic scattering of photoelectrons - the scattering signal is strongest for theta_s = 0.
For high-energy electrons in the range from a few hundred electron volts to several keV, elastic scattering from the electronic clouds around adjacent atoms is associated with only a very small phase shift.
Hence in the forward direction, interference is constructive, while at larger angles, partial destructive interference causes the scattering amplitude to drop off sharply.
This forward scattering results in an amplification of the scattering intensity along low-index crystallographic axes, where the photoelectrons regularly meet atoms.
XPD and UPD therefore provide direct real-space information on the directions between neighbours.
Because of the high sensitivity of surfaces to contaminants and the typical kinetic energies of the photoelectrons, XPD and UPD only work for the near-surface region of single-crystal samples kept in ultrahigh vacuum.
An example of XPD is shown here.
The single-layer sp2-hybridized material hexagonal boron nitride is isoelectronic with graphene, and is of high technological interest, as it can form a corrugated â€œnanomeshâ€� when deposited on the surfaces of certain transition-metals.
These nano meshes can act as trapping centres for other molecules, or indeed induce periodic segregation on a nanometer scale when alloys of metals are used as the substrate material.
In order to fully understand their physical, chemical, and potential catalytic properties, their structure should be known with high accuracy.
One very important parameter is a knowledge of d_A-S the distance between the h-BN layer and the top atomic layer of the metal, as this provides information on bonding strength and the redistribution of electron density across the nano mesh, and also provides important starting information for theoretical calculations.
The nominal structure of h-BN on Ni(111) is shown on the top right, both in plan and side view.
The recorded XPD signal from the ejection of the Nitrogen 1s electron is shown bottom right.
Strong forward scattering in the direction of the N-N bonds and the N-B bonds can be seen in the hemispherical plot of the XPD intensity.
This was modelled, for which the best fit was for a distance d_A-S of 2.11 +/- 0.002
Angstroms.
XPS at synchrotrons is not in general used for high-resolution chemical analysis (ESCA), as this can normally be performed quite satisfactorily using a lab-based source.
The exception to this rule is high-pressure
XPS (HPXPS), also called ambient-pressure
PES.
Although photoemission is a highly powerful tool for investigating clean surfaces under ultrahigh-vacuum conditions, many interesting processes occur on surfaces, and surface chemistry under realistic reaction conditions have pressures several orders of magnitude higher than those typically used for traditional XPS experiments.
Such â€œambientâ€� experiments are thus excluded from investigation using standard PES spectrometers.
This has been in recent years the spur to develop the APPES technique.
A typical example of the application of APPES is the investigation of the surface chemistry and its change under different reaction conditions
(in particular gas pressure and type) of heterogeneous catalysts.
The mean free path Lambda of an electron travelling through a gas depends on the gas pressure
P and the electronâ€™s kinetic energy E_e.
For a given gas type and electron energy, the product of Lambda and P is a constant.
An example is shown here for electrons travelling through oxygen gas.
So, a photoelectron with a kinetic energy
E_e of 400 eV would have a mean free path in 100 Pa (or 1 mbar) oxygen of approximately
4 mm.
XPS measurements at higher pressures are made possible by employing one or more differentially pumped stages between the sample surface and the electron analyzer.
The diameter D0 of the primary aperture is decisive for the fundamental scales of the experiment with regards to observable photoelectron energies and maximum possible pressures.
There is a fine balance between placing the aperture too close to the sample, thereby perturbing the chemical environment, and positioning it too far away, when scattering of the primary photoelectron by the gas becomes highly probable, and the solid angle subtended by the aperture becomes so tiny that the captured photoelectron signal becomes unacceptably small.
In practice, the ideal separation between the sample surface and the primary aperture is a few times D0.
The maximum ambient gas pressure is inversely proportional to D0, hence reducing D0 allows a higher ambient pressure, but at the cost of photoemission signal, which scales with
D0^2.
Typical modern APPES chambers have apertures in the range of 0.5 mm, sampleâ€“aperture distances of the order of a few mm, and hence maximum working pressures approximately 1000
Pa (10 mbar).
The introduction of electrostatic lenses in the differentially pumped stages in order to collect a larger fraction of the photoemission signal represented a breakthrough in APPES technology.
In addition to reactions occurring on solid surfaces, chemistry from a liquid jet is another possibility, whereby the jet is collected in a catcher with a narrow entrance.
Such experiments have the added advantage that the liquid surface is being constantly refreshed.
We complete our overview of photoelectron techniques with a brief synopsis of hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, or HAXPES. â€œNormalâ€� UPS and XPS depends intimately on the properties in the near surface region, given by the inelastic mean-free path of the photoelectrons, which in most cases is less than a nanometer.
This means that samples must be kept exceedingly clean with well-defined crystallographic and chemical properties, while any structural differences of the surface region, and through this, also of the chemical and/or electronic properties, can often mean that such experiments might not represent the properties of the bulk material.
Below approximately 2 nm from the surface of a single-crystal sample, one can generally assume that the properties are essentially bulk like.
In order to access these depths, however, electron kinetic energies (and therefore also photon energies) in excess of a keV or even higher must be used, according to the universal curve.
These high energies are, unfortunately, associated with low absorption cross-sections, which, away from absorption edges, drop off as 1/hnu^3, as you might remember from the second week in this course.
In addition, the detector efficiency drops off as 1/E_e, while in order to maintain the desired chemical sensitivity through subtle chemical shifts of the order of 0.1 eV, the analyser specifications are tighter still than in normal XPS.
Despite all these technical difficulties, there are several important advantages to
HAXPES.
First, because the bulk is being probed, the need for ultrahigh vacuum conditions, required in normal XPS in order to maintain surface cleanliness, is obviated.
Secondly, this increase in the probing depth increases the periodicity â€œseenâ€� by the electron in the direction perpendicular to the surface, which thus reduces the uncertainty of the wavevector of the electrons in this direction.
This allows a more precise definition of the full 3-D wavevector k_e than is possible in â€œnormalâ€� ARPES.
Lastly, because the photon wavelengths at these high energies are generally significantly smaller than typical interatomic spacings, the photoemission matrix elements reduce to atomic cross-sections, thus simplifying data analysis.
The momentum of photoelectrons in HAXPES can be significant, causing the emitting atom to recoil.
According to the conservation of momentum, the apparent binding energy will shift due to this recoil, which must be taken into account, in particular for light elements.
Summarising this weekâ€™s videos, spectroscopic techniques that use synchrotron radiation have the unique advantage that the incoming x-rays can be tuned and/or scanned in energy.
This adds an invaluable new dimension to experiments excluded to those based on laboratory x-ray sources and has been exploited to full advantage in many of the above-described methods, not least in XAS, ARPES and RIXS.
Indeed, all XAS techniques are only possible using tunable synchrotron light.
The high brilliance of third-generation sources, coupled with the ability to focus down to the nanometer scale, has opened up new vistas in synchrotron spectroscopy.
Enormous progress has also been made in the performance of fast, energy dispersive detectors, and it is expected that the range of experiments available will continue to burgeon as rapidly as has been experienced in the last decade.
Spectroscopy using x-rays will remain the most prominent and sought after general synchrotron technique because of the detailed information that can be gleaned about the chemical and electronic properties of matter.
In an era where ever more novel and unexpected materials are being tailored and synthesized, synchrotron spectroscopy will continue to play a central role in materials research.
