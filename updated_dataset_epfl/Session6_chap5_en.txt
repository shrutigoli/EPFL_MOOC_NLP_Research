To conclude the making process of maps, this last part will address the question of cartographic â€œdesignâ€�.
This expression aims at expressing a simple idea:
The map proposes a singular combination of a message and an ergonomics.
The object design proceeds in a similar manner, through the association of an identity and a functionality.
A chairâ€™s design, for example, requires an originality of creative form or an innovative material and the presentation of a comfortable seat.
A map must be comfortable.
A good map is a comfortable device to gain access to an idea concerning space.
The interest of this kind of approach in cartography also resides in the fact that itoften requires making geographic thoughts clearer.
The act of mapping often acts in practice to reveal unthought-of issues in a spatial problem.
Cartography is thus the search for an equilibrium.
It does not exclude beauty, nor the search of aesthetics more generally, a search which must guide the cartographer.
It demands of itself a finished geographical thought and the search for the right picture, even before the technical and graphical mastery, which can also be confided to specialists.
That to say that the map is, above all, an affair of intuition and creation. â€œOpenâ€� cartography, of which I have sketched the broad outlines here, clashes with a cartographic tradition which tends to impose norms whose justification is not always evident, especially concerning what is traditionally called the Â«Â dressingÂ Â» of maps.
Certainly, titling a map is doubtlessly essential.
However, a legend is not always necessary, for certain simple maps can use the title in place of a legend.
As for the scale, it is only useful in the measure that the instrumental component of the map is sufficiently important, if distances must be measured for example.
Be careful about the projection, which will often change the scales from one end of the map to another!
The prescription of scholarly cartography the most worthy of criticism is probably that of mentioning an orientation, a compass, or a North arrow.
Essential to topographical map and useful to a map whose statement is sun exposure, this indication of orientation is for the most part useless.
However, in a general way, this question introduces another: that of cartographcal implicit understanding.
As has been mentioned, cartography is also a tongue, with its culture, conventions, and grammar.
Conventionally, North is at the top of a page.
It is only indicated if this is not the case, and not placing it at the top can effectively be part of the cartographic message.
Since conventions exist, cartography can count on them.
It can partly be constructed upon implicit understanding, and not over-emphasise recourse to coding, which is characteristic of very technical and specialised instrumental maps, and sometimes even rather esoteric maps.
Another subject touching upon comfort and cartographic ergonomics concerns the basemap.
The basemap is in some ways a layer for propping.
It is a common world for several spaces, a common metric and scale.
The basemap often appears as a secondary map, a map which is slipped under the principle map and aiding its interpretation.
Nevertheless, this vision is perhaps a bit too simplistic, for it could be remarked that it is highly probably that this underlying map could also considerably modify the sense of the â€œprincipleâ€� map.
In a way, the basemap cannot be disassociated from the map itself.
It is an essential component.
It is not simply a neutral and arbitrary surface on which geographic data are projected.
It must be treated as a fully-fledged map, as well as being a means of expression in itself.
It is for example a good means for identifying a collection of maps, giving them a style (vintage), even breaking with usual codes by using unconventional colours
(the sea in black or redâ€¦).
But can we do without basemap?
Yes.
There exist auto-extensive maps, which form of themselves their own base.
Only the locations of places in relationship to one another count.
This kind of map can be read in terms of shapes.
They can be compared according to their general look and their similarities.
The interest of this kind of map is not to induce visual groupings through graphical objects the places of which they represent are not thought to have a geographical function in the spatial issue represented. 
Representing a map of the cities of the world without a basemap of continents can allow, for example, to better discern the great masses of planetary settlement, and this without being influenced by continental groupings or oceanic discontinuities.
To finish, I wish to highlight an essential point in the act of mapping:
Every map is inserted within a world of signs which pre-exist it, and to be effective, every map must take this into account.
This relationship to the graphical world of the map can firstly be found within itself.
It is marked by the style of the map.
Whether it is desired or not, whether it be the result of a voluntary and creative act or the application of predefined oftware automatisms, every map is endowed with a certain graphical style.
It implicitly answers to a cartographic charter, even to a graphical charter.
The work of the cartographer does not thus stop simply at colouring polygons on a sheet of paper.
It also consists in mastering the style of the product, even in developing oneâ€™s own style, a cartographic signature, in a way in which a personâ€™s maps can all be recognisable as that personâ€™s.
The remainder depends upon the professional cartographerâ€™s skill to conform oneself as little as necessary to the graphical charter which is imposed by the publication environment for the maps.
Even if, otherwise, the cartographic charter he gives himself can sensibly differ in order not to restrain his creative capacity.
However, this liberty is all the easier to conquer if the cartographer who proves to be original can claim the status of the author of a cartographic work.
The second step in successfully inserting a map into its environment concerns its relationships with its immediate vicinity.
It is rare for a map to be presented on its own, alone, without complement, without an editorial environment, without accompanying text, nor table, nor even that it accompany something, and be sufficient on its own.
The cartographic work at this level thus consists firstly in fixing a principle for the demarcation of cartographic space.
It can be contained within a frame, in a once again very traditional and expected manner according to scholarly cartography.
It could to the contrary be conquering and interfere in the interstices of its environment.
This is essentially an affairfor negotiation, but definitively marks the place given to cartography in a statement about space.
The second work of cartographer thus also consists in giving an opinion on the repartitioning of roles amongst different â€œmediaâ€�.
The best principle consists in letting the map say what it says best, better than a text or paintings could, and to the contrary it must renounce mapping that which the properties of other media could treat with more finesse or dexterity.
However, there also exists a third level of integrating a map into its environment, which is related to its insertion within a communicational system, at once both symbolic and material.
At the material level, the work of the cartographer also consists in knowing the different physical bases for the map.
Of course, this includes screens and their optical characteristics, but also papers and inks as well as their ability to render such-and-such a colour nuance.
A map projected onto a screen is not under the same demands as that printed in a book.
However, a cartographer is also partly a â€œcommunicatorâ€�.
That is to say someone who not only knows how to say things but knows to whom to say them, when, how, in which exact manner, and especially what not to say, what may cause a problem.
A cartographer also understands the orders given to emphasise such-or-such a space when this order cannot be obviously stated.
A cartographer can be a communications counsellor, even if it means advising not making a map.
This is the case when he thinks that cartographic media is inappropriate to the role which it is to be made to play, and ultimately the message to be conveyed.
This happens more often than might be realised, for the effect of a truth produced by the geographic image associated with the necessity of locating things sometimes obliges the client to clarify the positions which she would have preferred to leave aside to verbal imprecision.
At the end of this conference, which is presently ending,
I would like to insist upon a point which has guided us all throughout this introduction to â€œmapdesignâ€�:
The cartography of human spaces is a human activity.
This guiding statement seems important to me, for it is a necessary condition for the opening up of cartography well beyond the world of cartographers and specialists, and all the way to geographers.
Curiously, as much in their education as in their practices, geographers are not always either very interested nor very involved in this technological discipline.
Its richness is however amusing, and training in it offers both an exciting study of the statistical processing and of the history of Art.
This open cartography is also a free cartography.
Free to try new images, free to make mistakes, and to lack effectiveness.
However, it is also free in an essential thing for geography itself:
Free to outline new spaces. 
For - and this is also one of the essential points of our statement - , for many, the map is  to be found in the definition of spaces in particular, and space in general.
Its renewal is one of the certain means of making progress in geography.
