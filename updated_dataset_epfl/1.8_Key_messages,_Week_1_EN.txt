So, we've made it through the first week of the course.
We started by discussing the global burden of disease following different disease classification systems.
We learned about the importance of diarrheal disease, both in terms of morbidity, expressed in DALYs, and mortality or deaths.
And we saw some different resources where you can get information about burden of dis, of disease from the World
Health Organization and from IHME.
We also had an introduction to the different water-borne pathogens, the helminths, protozoa, bacteria, and viruses, that can cause disease in drinking water.
We then looked at contamination pathways which can lead to people being exposed to fecal pathogens.
Using the tool of the F-diagram, we focused in on the water related pathways.
The safe water chain.
Moving from the water resource to the point of consumption.
We also discussed fecal indicator bacteria as a way of monitoring a proxy of fecal contamination rather than trying to directly measure pathogens.
Next, we had a first glance at the treatment processes, sedimentation, filtration and different types of disinfection.
Followed by safe storage.
These will be explored more in the coming weeks.
