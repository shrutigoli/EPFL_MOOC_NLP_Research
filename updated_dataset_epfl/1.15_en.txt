Law is only effective if it is implemented, and its rules, processes and obligations are followed and upheld.
Making sure this happens is part of what we call â€œCompliance and Enforcement.â€�
Compliance means adherence to legal rules by the regulated entities.
Enforcement refers to measures to compel compliance.
Compliance does not always require enforcement.
A lot of times compliance is completely voluntary.
I donâ€™t cross the street when the light is red, not because Iâ€™m afraid of getting arrested, but because Iâ€™m afraid of getting hit by a car.
Or because of social pressure to comply.
I donâ€™t attack other people because I donâ€™t want to and it seems wrong, not because Iâ€™m afraid of going to jail.
And in some cases, I comply with a law just because itâ€™s the law and it seems like a reasonable and legitimate law that I see no reason to break.
However, voluntary compliance is not always enough.
This is where enforcement comes in.
There are a few different models for compliance and enforcement.
One model is based on the idea that most people comply with law most of the time, as long as the law seems legitimate and fair, and compliance is relatively easy.
This is called the normative model.
Under this model, compliance and enforcement measures should ensure that the system seems fair and just, and help people comply.
The second model assumes that people are rational, and will decide whether to comply or not by weighing the costs and benefits involved.
Compliance and enforcement measures can improve compliance by changing the cost-benefit analysis.
If it is more expensive, more dangerous, and more difficult to break the law than to comply with it, fewer people will choose not to comply.
This is called the rational model.
There are two sides to this cost-benefit calculation: the costs of breaking the law should be higher than the benefits lawbreakers get.
Flipped around, the benefits of compliance with the law should be higher than the costs of complying.
This gives us four basic approaches to improving compliance through the cost-benefit model.
The first approach is to lower the cost of compliance, by making it easy and cheap to comply.
This requires making sure that everyone knows how to comply â€“ that they know what the law is and what is expected of them.
For example, protected areas should be clearly demarcated, and neighboring communities should understand what activities are permitted where.
In addition, compliance should not impose an undue burden.
Where a community entirely depends on activities within a protected area for their livelihoods, legally prohibiting these activities without providing alternatives will probably result in extensive non-compliance.
Addressing this will require considering the needs of the community and how they can be met while achieving conservation goals.
The second approach to improving compliance is to increase the benefits of compliance, through incentives such as subsidies, tax exemptions, information or technical support.
One of the best ways to improve compliance is to give people a share in the benefits of conservation, so that they have a direct stake in making sure it is successful.
Involving communities and other affected stakeholders directly in management and regulation can have this result.
A third approach is reducing the benefits of non-compliance.
You may have heard the phrase, â€œcrime doesnâ€™t payâ€�.
Unfortunately, non-compliance often does pay, so reducing that payout can go a long way to improving compliance.
One way to do this is by cutting down demand for unsustainably sourced products like ivory and rosewood.
Where environmental harm is driven by international markets, as is frequently the case, demand reduction can require transnational cooperation and significant action on the part of importing countries.
However, demand reduction can also be an effective tactic at the local level, where unsustainable products are headed for domestic markets.
For example, increasing availability of sustainable energy can reduce demand for illegally harvested charcoal.
Where the demand that is driving biodiversity loss is local, it is important to understand the local needs and acceptable sustainable alternatives.
A final approach to improving compliance under the rational model is increasing the cost of non-compliance directly, through criminal prosecution or administrative and civil measures for enforcement.
Enforcement can serve three basic functions.
The first is punishment or retribution.
This can improve compliance under the normative model, by making the system seem just.
Excessive or disproportionate punishment can undermine this function, and make law seem less legitimate.
A second function is direct prevention, by making sure that the target of enforcement cannot violate the law again.
It does this by putting the violator in prison or taking away the means to carry out the activity by confiscating equipment, revoking licenses, or destroying financial means by imposing fines.
Direct prevention makes the most difference when targeting the biggest players causing the most harm.
Removing a single poacher may not significantly reduce noncompliance where there are a thousand others to take their place.
However, removing a kingpin of a criminal organization can have a significant effect on the illegal market as a whole.
The third function of enforcement is deterrence.
Punishing violators sends a message to other violators that if they break the law, the consequences will outweigh the potential benefit.
This function might be the most important function of enforcement, but it is also the hardest to prove.
To be an effective deterrent, enforcement must be consistent, and the penalties must be sufficiently high to change the cost-benefit calculation.
The risk of being caught times the cost of punishment must be higher than the benefit of noncompliance.
Compliance and enforcement works a little bit differently at the international level.
When countries donâ€™t comply with their obligations, we canâ€™t really put them in jail.
But there are ways to promote and facilitate compliance with international obligations, and resolve disputes that arise between countries.
Even though international law often doesnâ€™t have a global enforcement mechanism, like a global judiciary, States usually comply with it.
Compliance with international law takes place for many reasons: reputation, reciprocity, benefits of compliance, or high cost of non-compliance.
Like individuals, States may comply because they feel the law is legitimate and fair or because when they ratify an agreement this entails a normative obligation they cannot ignore.
The international order depends on the principle of â€œpacta sunt servandaâ€� under which international treaties must be honored and states must comply with them.
Nevertheless, not all States always comply with international law.
International agreements can provide a limited range of enforcement mechanisms including penalties such as trade sanctions or withdrawal of eligibility to participate in the mechanisms of the treaty.
Many international treaties include dispute resolution mechanisms, such as provisions for arbitration, mediation or referral of disputes to the International Court of Justice.
The International Court of Justice is the judicial organ of the United Nations and the most preeminent international court.
The Courtâ€™s role is to settle, in accordance with international law, legal disputes submitted to it by States and to give advisory opinions on legal questions referred to it by the UN and its specialized agencies.
According to the Article 94 (1) of the UN
Charter â€œeach Member of the United Nations undertakes to comply with the decisions of the ICJ in any case to which it is a partyâ€�, therefore, all judgments of the ICJ are binding.
Nevertheless, the ICJ has some flaws: Currently, only 73 States have accepted the jurisdiction of the Court.
Moreover, the ICJ has no power to enforce its resolutions by itself â€“ this power is held by the UN Security Council, whose Permanent
Members have the right to veto any decision or recommendation of the Court in which they are allegedly responsible.
Most importantly, a case can only be heard by the ICJ if the countries have given their consent for the Court to hear it.
It is important to remember that at both the national and international level the objective of compliance measures is to improve compliance.
The goal is not to put more poachers in jail or impose more international sanctions, but to create a world where there is less poaching and less violation of international law.
Enforcement measures can help with this, by creating deterrence or promoting a sense of fairness and justice, but the ultimate goal is a world where all people and countries follow their obligations to value and respect nature and natural resources.
