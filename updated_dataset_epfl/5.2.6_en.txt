Let's talk now about the attitude control and translation control of the Space Shuttle from the forward flight deck and the aft flight deck.
Of course this is all history, but it's quite interesting the way these controls were implemented in the forward station and the aft station, so I think it's worth having a look at it.
We have first of all the commander's seat on the lefthand side looking forward and on the righthand side, pilot's seat.
And we have here the commander's rotation hand controller, three degrees of freedom, or three axes of rotation, rotation hand controller, and we have the translation hand controller here.
On the pilot's side, we only have a rotation hand controller.
The translation hand controller was only available for the commander on the lefthand side.
Now, in order to do translations and rotations, we always need to have a reference direction.
And the reference direction, in this case, is the <i>plus X</i> direction, which is this direction here,
<i>plus X</i> toward the nose.
Just a little detail that I want to explain also, this is the attitude director indicator.
We have the same on the pilot's side.
And, as indicated before, we can have either the attitude indicated according to the inertial coordinate system, the geocentric inertial coordinate system, or the LVLH.
And there was a switch about here that we could change from the position inertial to LVLH.
We had the choice between one or the other.
And the attitude indicating the ADI, attitude director indicator, left or right, but always according to what was selected on this switch.
That's it for the forward cockpit.
Let's look now at the aft flight deck.
For most of the time during the orbit portion, the commander or the pilot were commanding in rotation or translation the Space Shuttle orbiter from the aft flight deck.
Here you have the rotation hand controller.
Here you have the translation hand controller.
And it's interesting to see that both are according to 45 degree direction versus the <i>minus X</i> body axis of the Space Shuttle.
In fact, <i>minus X</i> is in this direction.
And we have <i>minus Z</i> in this direction here.
This is <i>minus X</i>.
It was possible to select control of the rotation and translation of the Space Shuttle either with respect to a reference direction which is <i>minus X</i> or <i>minus Z</i>-- it was a switch also in this area here.
We could select either <i>minus X</i> or <i>minus Z</i>.
So you always had to imagine that you were either controlling versus the <i>minus X</i> or versus <i>minus Z</i>.
You really needed to know exactly what was the selection of this switch.
And the idea was to make the control of the Space Shuttle as intuitive as possible, but also as practical as possible, depending on your goals and the kind of operation that you were performing from the aft flight deck.
Let's look now at the rotation hand controller positive deflections, and we have the rotation hand controller.
This is all taken from the training documentation.
It's not extremely high resolution but accept it as it is.
This is pitch, and here we control the roll and here the yaw.
So as opposed to an airplane, the rotation hand controller had three axes of rotation, pitch, roll and yaw.
On a normal airplane, you only have pitch and roll.
The yaw is controlled with the rudder pedals.
And, again, we always have a reference direction for the forward RHC.
I'm going to write this here,
"Ref direction"
This is <i>+X</i>.
Here we have the <i>-X</i> reference direction and this is the <i>-Z</i>.
And if you are doing pitch inputs--
Let's take this column here, the pitch input from the forward flight deck.
A positive pitch will give you, of course, a pitch up.
Though we understand that, that's very intuitive like an airplane.
And if you have a positive roll, you are going to roll to the right.
We know that, and if you yaw positive with the rotation hand controller not with the rudder pedals, you are going to have the yaw to the right, that's clear.
Now if you add the aft flight deck and you use the RHC with a <i>-X</i> selection of the switch that I talked about before, the reference direction is <i>-X</i>.
So if you do positive pitch with a rotation hand controller, you are going to have the tail going up.
We understand that.
If you do positive roll, it's going to be, in fact, the negative roll of the orbiter.
So the port wing is going to come down, we understand that one, so it's just opposite of what we had before from the forward flight deck.
And if you do a yaw, a positive yaw has got to take the tail to the right.
We understand that one too.
And if you take the <i>- Z</i> reference in the last column, it's going to be the same for pitch.
We understand that, but a roll input on the rotation hand controller is going to give you a yaw.
And the yaw inputs on the rotation hand controller if you select the <i>-Z</i> reference direction is going to give you an orbiter roll.
So again, the idea was to have the inputs as intuitive as possible but have this capability to have either from the aft flight deck, the <i>-X</i> or the <i>-Z</i> reference direction.
On the two illustrations on the right-hand side, you see this reference directions
I talked about before.
If you are forward, this is <i>+X</i> obviously.
And if you are in the aft flight deck, again, you can select as a reference direction the <i>-X</i>, as we mentioned before, or the <i>-Z</i>, looking up.
And again, you always operate the rotation hand controller or the translation hand controller from the aft flight deck with its 45 degree inclination, but in your mind you have to always think, "Do I have as a reference direction,
<i>-X</i> or <i>-Z</i>?"
Let's take the case of the use of the translation hand controller from the forward station, the aft station.
Again, the ref direction is <i>+X</i>.
Here it's <i>-X</i>, then <i>-Z</i> here depending on the position of the switch and the aft flight deck.
This is a translation hand controller and the plus is a push, and here it's a down for plus, as you see here.
And here it's right for plus.
And this is going to be from the forward flight deck, the reaction of the Space Shuttle obviously a push from the forward deck is going to perform a translation in the <i>+X</i> direction, body direction of the Shuttle.
If you go down, it's going to go down.
If you go to the right, it's going to the right.
So this is all according to intuition.
If you're on the back-- look at this column here-- if you push, obviously you're going to go toward the tail.
We understand that.
If you go down, you're also going to go down to the <i>+Z</i> direction.
And if you give an input to the right, it's going to be a displacement to the right, looking toward the tail of the orbiter.
We understand that one.
If you're the <i>-Z</i> reference direction, things will change.
If you push you got to go in the direction <i>-Z</i> to the top.
If you give an input down to the translation hand controller, you're going to go toward the tail.
We understand this one, and if you give an input to the right, you're going in this direction.
So, again, it's all intuitive.
You need to know when you're on the back if you are working with a <i>-X</i> or the <i>-Z</i> reference direction.
