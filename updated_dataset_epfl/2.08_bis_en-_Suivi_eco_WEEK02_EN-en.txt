To find the parameter of the population distribution law, we can proceed by checking if the one we think to be right truly is right.
The parameter we estimate should then belong to an interval of plausible values.
To test this, we will take a sample and see if the parameter's measured value is consistent with our supposition.
This is a hypothesis test.
Let's again have a look at our elephant population.
We think, by observing it over time, that it's mean age is 25 years, and we can see that it has a normal distribution.
We choose significance level Î±=0.05.
For our hypothesis, H0 is true, and the difference between the sample mean and the population mean should be under 1.96 Î±/âˆšn.
Now, at random, let's take a sample a sample of 52 individuals from the population.
The age values are indicated here.
The sample mean is 19.3 and the standard-deviation is 12.6.
The âˆšn is 7.2.
We have 19.3-25=5.7 and 1.96 (12.6/7.2)=3.43.
H0 is not verified and we can reject the hypothesis that the average age of the population is 25 years.
