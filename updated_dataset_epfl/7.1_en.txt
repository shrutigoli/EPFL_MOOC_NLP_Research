I'm in a terrible situation now.
The relief aid money of (Nrs.) 22,000
[approximately USD 200] has been already spent.
Nowadays, we are somehow surviving.
We are in a hard and quite difficult condition.
Dear participants,
Welcome to the final chapter of the MOOC:
A Resilient Future: Science and Technology for Disaster Risk Reduction
In this chapter, we will present how science and technology capacity can help us to become more resilient against disasters, and thus how risk can be an engine for sustainable development.
We will also introduce some key principles of science and technology application in the context of DRR.
Some of the key questions that will be addressed in this chapter include:
How can science and technology increase resilience?
How can risk and disaster risk reduction be considered an engine for development?
How should gender be considered in DRR?
How can technologies be applied in a sustainable manner?
And what are a few of the funding schemes for science and technology for DRR?
This chapter starts with an interview with Ambassador Manuel Bessler.
Several video lectures and interviews will follow.
Welcome to the last chapter of this MOOC.
