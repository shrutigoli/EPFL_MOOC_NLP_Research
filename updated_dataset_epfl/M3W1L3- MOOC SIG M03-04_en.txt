00:00:31,607 --> 00:00:33,675
Hello and welcome to this lesson

2
00:00:33,875 --> 00:00:36,326
which introduces the concept
of spatial auto-correlation.

3
00:00:36,747 --> 00:00:38,284
We will mainly talk about

4
00:00:38,484 --> 00:00:39,506
spatial dependance,

5
00:00:39,706 --> 00:00:41,158
so determine

6
00:00:41,358 --> 00:00:44,130
to what extent the value taken
by the attribute of an object

7
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:47,304
depends on its geographical 
position or not

8
00:00:47,504 --> 00:00:49,050
This can be the case

9
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:50,459
of the measured temperature

10
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:52,167
on the surface of the 
leaves of a plant

11
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,024
for example.

12
00:00:53,665 --> 00:00:54,713
The objectives of this lesson

13
00:00:54,913 --> 00:00:57,443
are to explain the concept of
spatial dependence

14
00:00:57,844 --> 00:00:59,427
and to present the paradox

15
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:02,366
linked to the use of the tools
of the classical statistic

16
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:04,016
in a geographical context.

17
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,521
The information presented here

18
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:08,261
will allow you to assimilate

19
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:10,564
the concept of spatial dependance,

20
00:01:10,764 --> 00:01:12,433
which is a fundamental concept

21
00:01:12,633 --> 00:01:14,917
for the measurement of
spatial auto-correlation

22
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:17,720
and to recognize the bias induced

23
00:01:17,945 --> 00:01:19,973
by the use of classical statistics

24
00:01:20,173 --> 00:01:20,995
in this context.

25
00:01:33,155 --> 00:01:35,253
It is a quantitative geographer,

26
00:01:35,453 --> 00:01:36,325
a Swiss-American,

27
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:38,075
named Waldo Tobler

28
00:01:38,275 --> 00:01:40,246
who best described this concept

29
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:43,361
by enunciating what is called
the first law of geography

30
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:46,087
in an article written in 1970.

31
00:01:46,626 --> 00:01:47,528
According to this law,

32
00:01:47,728 --> 00:01:50,282
everything interacts with
everything in the geographical space,

33
00:01:50,482 --> 00:01:51,957
but two close objects

34
00:01:52,157 --> 00:01:53,406
are more likely to do so

35
00:01:53,606 --> 00:01:54,941
than two distant objects.

36
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,916
To illustrate this notion of
spatial dependence,

37
00:01:58,116 --> 00:01:59,526
here is a first example

38
00:01:59,726 --> 00:02:00,617
related to football.

39
00:02:00,924 --> 00:02:02,512
we will focus our attention

40
00:02:02,712 --> 00:02:04,487
on brazilian and croatian supporters

41
00:02:04,687 --> 00:02:07,467
during the opening match of 
the 2014 world cup

42
00:02:07,667 --> 00:02:09,481
between Brazil and Croatia.

43
00:02:10,778 --> 00:02:11,679
In this image,

44
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:13,599
an individual dressed in yellow

45
00:02:13,799 --> 00:02:15,632
has more chance to interact

46
00:02:15,832 --> 00:02:18,012
with another person wearing
the same color.

47
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:19,619
And in the same way

48
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:21,534
a person in red and white

49
00:02:21,734 --> 00:02:23,419
has a better chance of interacting

50
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:25,440
with another person in red and white.

51
00:02:25,951 --> 00:02:27,991
The membership of a same group

52
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:31,068
determined the spatial
distribution of these people

53
00:02:31,649 --> 00:02:33,179
and the spatial dependence

54
00:02:33,379 --> 00:02:35,012
induced by this membership

55
00:02:35,212 --> 00:02:38,080
is perceptible in the geographical space

56
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,733
thanks to the color of the t-shirts.

57
00:02:40,586 --> 00:02:41,670
Another example,

58
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:42,650
here in Dakar,

59
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:44,453
around the international airport,

60
00:02:44,653 --> 00:02:45,847
which we see in the image.

61
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,926
The commercial and logistical activities

62
00:02:49,126 --> 00:02:51,202
linked to the activity of the airport

63
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:53,323
are grouped around it,

64
00:02:53,523 --> 00:02:55,189
whereas other activities,

65
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:57,111
such as the residential area, for example,

66
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:58,501
which we see in the foreground,

67
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:00,979
are gathered elsewhere on the territory.

68
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:03,264
Around the airport,

69
00:03:03,464 --> 00:03:04,938
the buildings are similar,

70
00:03:05,138 --> 00:03:07,898
there are large warehouses or hangars.

71
00:03:08,098 --> 00:03:11,349
And this is also the case
in the residential area.

72
00:03:11,916 --> 00:03:14,925
The houses have a similar
appearance and size.

73
00:03:16,565 --> 00:03:18,057
The spatial proximity

74
00:03:18,257 --> 00:03:20,785
favours the interaction between
objects of the same category

75
00:03:21,548 --> 00:03:23,007
and the nature of the activity

76
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:24,978
is betrayed by a similar appearance.

77
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:27,335
The spatial dependence

78
00:03:27,535 --> 00:03:29,139
highlighted by the two examples

79
00:03:29,364 --> 00:03:30,337
which we have just seen

80
00:03:30,537 --> 00:03:32,558
can be measured with simple tools

81
00:03:32,758 --> 00:03:34,416
that you will learn to manipulate.

82
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:36,400
The functioning of these tools

83
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,066
is based on the comparison

84
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:40,170
between an observed spatial distribution

85
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,055
and a random spatial distribution.

86
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:45,921
On this regular grid of 10 Ã— 10 cells,

87
00:03:46,483 --> 00:03:48,529
we have represented
the spatial distribution

88
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:49,459
of a phenomenon.

89
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:51,940
There is a particular arrangement

90
00:03:52,133 --> 00:03:53,133
of the displayed values,

91
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,381
which indicates a certain
spatial dependence.

92
00:03:56,789 --> 00:03:57,430
On the right,

93
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,543
we have illustrated the
random spatial distribution

94
00:04:00,743 --> 00:04:01,711
of the same values

95
00:04:01,911 --> 00:04:03,574
but in several configurations.

96
00:04:04,629 --> 00:04:05,425
On the left,

97
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,818
the geographical space is not neutral.

98
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:10,211
In some ways, it fixes

99
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:12,934
certain values in specific places.

100
00:04:14,998 --> 00:04:16,752
On the right, it is neutral.

101
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:18,949
Any location in space

102
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:21,000
can take all possible values.

103
00:04:21,531 --> 00:04:22,484
On this base,

104
00:04:22,684 --> 00:04:24,911
the measurement tools that we will use

105
00:04:25,637 --> 00:04:26,180
allow

106
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,883
firstly to quantify

107
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,910
the spatial regularity of a phenomenon

108
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:32,683
then to determine

109
00:04:32,883 --> 00:04:34,979
the radius of action of the
spatial dependence

110
00:04:35,673 --> 00:04:36,881
and finally

111
00:04:37,081 --> 00:04:39,988
to differentiate an observed
spatial distribution

112
00:04:40,188 --> 00:04:42,464
from a random spatial distribution.

113
00:04:43,334 --> 00:04:45,348
Let's consider real data now.

114
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:49,002
This map shows 765 neolithic sites,

115
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:50,906
they have been dated

116
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:54,844
and their age is between 6,000 and
8,000 years before the present.

117
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:57,303
The darker the green of the point,

118
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:59,628
the older the neolithic site.

119
00:05:01,006 --> 00:05:03,296
We notice that the oldest sites

120
00:05:03,496 --> 00:05:05,696
are concentrated in the 
fertile crescent region

121
00:05:05,896 --> 00:05:08,370
and moving gradually towards 
the North-West,

122
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:10,495
we find sites that are younger.

123
00:05:12,563 --> 00:05:14,852
This is an example of spatial dependence

124
00:05:15,372 --> 00:05:17,365
that illustrates human migration

125
00:05:17,565 --> 00:05:18,694
towards the North

126
00:05:18,906 --> 00:05:22,006
after the end of the last major ice age.

127
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:24,947
We will reuse this example 
a little later.

128
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:32,992
From the moment

129
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:34,247
we want to quantify

130
00:05:34,447 --> 00:05:35,586
this spatial dependence,

131
00:05:35,786 --> 00:05:37,949
we are confronted with a paradox.

132
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:39,251
Indeed,

133
00:05:39,451 --> 00:05:41,874
according to Tobler and the
first law of geography,

134
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,178
everything interacts with everything

135
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:45,424
but close objects

136
00:05:45,624 --> 00:05:46,876
are more likely to do so

137
00:05:47,076 --> 00:05:48,303
than distant objects.

138
00:05:49,132 --> 00:05:50,866
So natural phenomena,

139
00:05:51,066 --> 00:05:52,261
such as air temperature,

140
00:05:52,474 --> 00:05:54,321
or socio-demographic phenomena,

141
00:05:54,533 --> 00:05:56,036
such as the population density,

142
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,535
are not randomly distributed

143
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:00,084
in the geographical space.

144
00:06:02,075 --> 00:06:04,802
But to measure the spatial
structure of these phenomena,

145
00:06:05,002 --> 00:06:06,636
we have to use tools

146
00:06:06,836 --> 00:06:08,395
of classical statistics.

147
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:11,084
And these tools require

148
00:06:11,284 --> 00:06:13,730
on one hand the independence
between the samples

149
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:17,122
and on the other hand a random
distribution of the latter,

150
00:06:17,615 --> 00:06:19,336
there is therefore a contradiction.

151
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:21,792
This contradiction is due to the fact

152
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:23,788
that the tools of the
classical statistics

153
00:06:23,988 --> 00:06:25,517
are not intended to be applied

154
00:06:25,717 --> 00:06:27,053
in a geospatial context.

155
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:29,275
Their use is based

156
00:06:29,475 --> 00:06:30,904
on the assumption that

157
00:06:31,104 --> 00:06:33,213
geographical space is neutral

158
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,175
This geographical area

159
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,845
constitutes the simple support,

160
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:38,822
without friction,

161
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:41,478
on which the studied 
phenomena take place.

162
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:44,579
Theoretically, in this context,

163
00:06:44,779 --> 00:06:47,273
the location of observations in space

164
00:06:47,473 --> 00:06:49,500
must not influence their attributes.

165
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:54,156
However, since there are
often no alternative tools,

166
00:06:54,717 --> 00:06:56,034
we should use them

167
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:57,619
with the awareness of the biases

168
00:06:57,819 --> 00:07:00,443
induced by their use with geographic data

169
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:03,212
and adapt the datasets

170
00:07:03,412 --> 00:07:05,723
to meet the statistical prerequisites.

171
00:07:06,535 --> 00:07:08,567
A good example is the linear regression.

172
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:09,957
Theoretically,

173
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:11,492
it must be calculated

174
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:13,249
with observations selected

175
00:07:13,449 --> 00:07:15,095
according to a random procedure.

176
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:17,824
Indeed,

177
00:07:18,024 --> 00:07:20,515
if the observations are 
spatially dependent,

178
00:07:21,106 --> 00:07:22,696
the estimated values will be biased

179
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:24,354
for the entire study area,

180
00:07:25,339 --> 00:07:28,112
because exceptional values,

181
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:30,900
located in geographical subregions,

182
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,809
will influence the predicted values

183
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:34,489
on all the analyzed territory.

184
00:07:36,032 --> 00:07:36,940
Or furthermore,

185
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,407
a strong correlation between
two sample attributes

186
00:07:39,607 --> 00:07:42,373
located in a same small subregion

187
00:07:42,573 --> 00:07:45,543
will influence the measurement
on all the studied area.

188
00:07:47,124 --> 00:07:49,447
We will now see a practical example

189
00:07:49,647 --> 00:07:51,222
to illustrate this type of bias.

190
00:07:52,163 --> 00:07:55,144
Let's take again the example
of the 765 neolithic sites.

191
00:07:55,994 --> 00:07:57,296
In the GeoDa software,

192
00:07:57,496 --> 00:07:58,850
we created three views.

193
00:07:59,747 --> 00:08:01,053
At the top, on the left,

194
00:08:01,388 --> 00:08:02,499
we have the histogram

195
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:05,589
of the age class distribution 
of the sites.

196
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:08,268
At the bottom, on the left,

197
00:08:08,803 --> 00:08:11,739
the spatial distribution 
of the 765 sites.

198
00:08:13,017 --> 00:08:14,047
And on the right,

199
00:08:14,636 --> 00:08:16,513
a graph that illustrates 
the relation

200
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:18,216
between the age of the sites 
on the Y axis

201
00:08:18,858 --> 00:08:21,380
and a genetic diversity
variable on the X axis

202
00:08:21,976 --> 00:08:24,097
that characterizes goat populations

203
00:08:24,297 --> 00:08:26,537
sampled around the sites

204
00:08:26,737 --> 00:08:28,317
at the beginning of the 21st century.

205
00:08:29,301 --> 00:08:31,161
This relationship is of interest

206
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:33,325
because it confirms the hypothesis

207
00:08:33,525 --> 00:08:35,618
that the neolithic populations

208
00:08:35,818 --> 00:08:36,777
of the fertile crescent

209
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:39,979
began to migrate towards the North-West

210
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,049
from the end of the last
great ice age.

211
00:08:44,684 --> 00:08:46,502
The lower the age of the sites,

212
00:08:46,702 --> 00:08:48,811
the lower the genetic diversity,

213
00:08:49,011 --> 00:08:50,592
since the animal populations

214
00:08:50,792 --> 00:08:52,457
have progressively fragmented

215
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,871
and the reproduction has
subsequently taken place

216
00:08:55,071 --> 00:08:56,431
between related individuals.

217
00:08:58,050 --> 00:08:59,155
The regression line

218
00:08:59,355 --> 00:09:00,104
shows

219
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:02,010
that the older the age of the sites,

220
00:09:02,210 --> 00:09:04,495
the higher the genetic diversity,

221
00:09:05,056 --> 00:09:06,326
but this relation

222
00:09:06,526 --> 00:09:07,655
is strongly influenced

223
00:09:07,855 --> 00:09:10,492
by a group of sites concentrated
in the Middle East.

224
00:09:11,077 --> 00:09:12,000
Indeed,

225
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:14,077
if this group of sites is removed
from the calculation,

226
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:17,030
the slope of the regression
decreases noticeably.

227
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:20,773
The values predicted by the model

228
00:09:20,973 --> 00:09:22,228
across Europe

229
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:25,068
are largely influenced by 
about forty points,

230
00:09:25,285 --> 00:09:27,545
all located in the same subregion.

231
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:38,815
Now you know

232
00:09:39,054 --> 00:09:40,574
what spatial dependence is.

233
00:09:40,774 --> 00:09:41,713
Near objects

234
00:09:41,913 --> 00:09:43,782
are more likely to interact
with each other

235
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:45,909
than to do so with distant objects.

236
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,687
Some attributes can be influenced

237
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:50,847
by characteristics of the environment

238
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:52,071
and therefore

239
00:09:52,271 --> 00:09:54,407
the geographic space is not neutral.

240
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:56,918
This highlights a paradox

241
00:09:57,118 --> 00:09:58,638
since the statistical tools

242
00:09:58,838 --> 00:10:00,357
we use most often

243
00:10:00,557 --> 00:10:02,203
require this space to be neutral.

244
00:10:04,046 --> 00:10:06,065
It is therefore on a random drawing

245
00:10:06,265 --> 00:10:09,316
of the objects that constitute
the georeferenced datasets,

246
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:10,945
that must carry the calculations.

247
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,327
We will see in the next lesson

248
00:10:14,527 --> 00:10:15,720
how to implement

249
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,588
a spatial auto-correlation measure

250
00:10:17,788 --> 00:10:21,051
and then how to determine
its significance.
