Hello, my name is Marco Picasso and I will present my course: numerical analysis for engineers.
This course contains the seven first chapters of a bachelor course given to the students of the Ecole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne (EPFL).
First, what is numerical analysis?
Numerical analysis is a subset of a larger discipline called scientific computing or computational sciences.
The goal is to simulate complex phenomena, for instance the flow around an airplane, the future or past retreat of glaciers, or even produce special effects for the film industry.
The road map to produce a numerical simulation is the following.
A mathematical model has to be derived.
For instance, when considering the flow around an airplane,
The velocity around the airplane has to be related to the pressure.
In general, the mathematical model is too complex to derive an explicit formula for the solution.
An algorithm is then needed to approach the solution of the model.
This is precisely the goal of numerical analysis.
Whenever possible, we will quantify the error between the output of the algorithm and the exact solution of the model, which is unknown.
Then, the algorithm is implemented on a computer, it is validated, and the results are eventually compared to experiments.
This numerical analysis course for engineers contains interpolation problems, finite difference formula, quadrature formula, so as methods to solve linear and nonlinear systems, and finally, methods to solve differential equations.
Each week a new Chapter will be presented, you will be asked to watch videos, answer quizzes, perform numerical experiments with matlab or octave, in order to illustrate the theory presented during the lectures.
I hope to see you soon in this course: numerical analysis for engineers.
