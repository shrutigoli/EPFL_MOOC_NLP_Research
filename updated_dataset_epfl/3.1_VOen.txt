Hello and welcome to this third module of the MOOC on protected areas management in Africa.
This week, we will talk about protected areas governance.
It is an extremely important subject, as we will see with Paul NDiaye, who is a lecturer at the University of Cheikh
Anta Diop University in Dakar.
So this week, the module will be structured as follows: the first class will be introducing the notion of governance and different types of governance that we come across in protected areas.
As for the second lesson, it will introduce governance by government, which applies to the majority of protected areas in Africa these days.
Less frequent, but just as important, is private governance, and this will be the topic of the third lesson.
The fourth lesson will be about governance by communities, the one that enables local populations to take control of managing a certain number of protected areas more and more frequently.
The fifth lesson will deal with shared governance, a type of governance that brings together several types of actors in the decision-making schemes.
They are sometimes complex, but they are always rich and innovative.
It is also being developed a lot at the moment.
The last lesson will be on our weekly convention.
Once again, we will be staying in the field of the Convention on Biological Diversity with a specific focus, here as well, on local communities.
We will be looking at how people access and share the advantages, and we will deal with the famous Nagoya Protocol.
Finally, we will have our brief weekly summary in the form of an animation, and then the assignment for this module will be explained to you.
There we go, it is now time for this module on governance.
Have an excellent third week with us!
