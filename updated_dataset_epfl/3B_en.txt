Welcome.
Welcome to the 
Plasma Physics course of EPFL.
In the past module, we have deduced the two-fluid equation.
In the present one, we will deduce the two-fluid dispersion relation.
That is, the relation between the frequency and the wave number of the waves and instability that are described by the two-fluid model.
In order to do that, the first thing that I will do with you is to recall the main elements of the linearization and the Fourier mode analysis.
Then we will linearize and Fourier transform both Maxwell equations and the two-fluid equations.
And at that point, we will deduce together the two-fluid dispersion relation.
So let's recall together very briefly, the main elements of linearization Fourier mode analysis, something that we have already applied within the kinetic model of plasmas.
Our goal is to study the evolution of small amplitude perturbations on top of an equilibrium.
Let's take an example to one of the continuity equation.
This says that the time derivative of the density is due to the divergence of the flux.
In order to study the evolution of small amplitude perturbations on top of the equilibrium, the first thing that we have to do is to separate the equilibrium quantities and the small perturbations.
Basically, we will write the density, for example, which is a function of space and time, as the sum of nâ‚€, a constant which does not depend on space nor time, plus a perturbation nâ‚�(r,t) and as we are dealing with small perturbations, we will assume that nâ‚�(r,t) is much, much smaller than nâ‚€.
Similarly for the velocity, we will say that this is given by an equilibrium quantity uâ‚€ plus the perturbation uâ‚�(r,t),
Now, if we look at the case of static equilibrium, we will have that this uâ‚€ will be equal to zero.
And therefore, u will only be given by this small perturbed velocity, uâ‚�(r,t).
The second step we do is linearizing the equation, retaining only the leading order terms.
The idea is to replace n with nâ‚€ + nâ‚�(r,t), and the u with uâ‚€ + uâ‚�(r,t).
Now again, in the case of static equilibrium, we can put uâ‚€ equal to zero and that equation we have just written becomes âˆ‚nâ‚€/âˆ‚t by expliciting this time derivative, âˆ‚nâ‚�/âˆ‚t, and then we will have -taking uâ‚€ = 0, âˆ‡â‹…(nâ‚€ uâ‚�) ..., and ... âˆ‡â‹…(nâ‚� uâ‚�) = 0
Now nâ‚€ does not depend on time nor on space, so this is equal to zero.
Here we have a nâ‚� term, we have nâ‚€ uâ‚�, and here we have a term that is the product of two quantities that are perturbed quantities, and therefore which is much smaller than the other two terms that we are retaining.
It's quadratic in terms of the perturbed quantities while these terms are linear in the perturbed quantities.
This is therefore, in other terms, a higher order term, and therefore can be neglected.
What we come up with is an equation that relates âˆ‚nâ‚�/âˆ‚t
-with taking nâ‚€ constant out,
... nâ‚€ âˆ‡â‹…uâ‚� = 0.
At this point we can apply our Fourier analysis.
We write, in fact, that nâ‚�(r,t), which is a function of space and time, is given by the integral of the Fourier modes.
Therefore it will be given by the double integral over all wavenumbers, all frequencies of the Fourier transform, which I will denote with a <i>tilde</i>, of
Ã±â‚�(K,Ï‰) exp {i (K â‹… r - Ï‰t) }
The advantage of doing that is that by Fourier transforming, operators like the nabla (âˆ‡) operator will become very easy in Fourier space.
For example, âˆ‡ becomes the operator i Kâ‹… and âˆ‚/âˆ‚t becomes the -iÏ‰ operator, it implies that by
Fourier transforming this equation and looking at the evolution of each Fourier mode, as each Fourier mode is independent from all the others, we get that 
-iÏ‰ nÌƒâ‚� + nâ‚€ i Kâ‹…uÌƒâ‚�= 0 which is the equation that relates the 
Fourier modes nÌƒâ‚�(K,Ï‰) and uÌƒâ‚�(K,Ï‰).
We are now ready to linearize and Fourier transform both the Maxwell equations and the two-fluid equations.
Let's start with the Maxwell equations.
The equation that are interesting for us are âˆ‡ Ã— E = -âˆ‚B/âˆ‚t and âˆ‡ Ã— B = Î¼â‚€ j + 1/cÂ² âˆ‚E/âˆ‚t .
From these two equations, taking the curl of the first equation we have that âˆ‡Ã—(âˆ‡Ã—E) = -âˆ‚/âˆ‚t(âˆ‡Ã—B) which is equal to 
-âˆ‚/âˆ‚t (Î¼â‚€j + 1/cÂ² âˆ‚E/âˆ‚t)
Bringing the time derivative in, this is equal to -Î¼â‚€âˆ‚j/âˆ‚t - 1/cÂ² âˆ‚Â²E/âˆ‚tÂ².
This is the equation we want to linearize.
The first thing we notice is that equilibrium terms in this equation do not play any role.
In fact, here we are dealing with spatial or temporal derivative, and therefore the constant uniform value of the equilibrium do not matter.
Therefore, only the perturbed terms enter in this equation and if we Fourier transform this equation and we linearize it, we find 
-KÃ—(KÃ—EÌƒâ‚�) = Î¼â‚€ iÏ‰ jÌƒâ‚� + Ï‰Â²/cÂ² EÌƒâ‚�
Here we have an ugly beast, the KÃ—(KÃ—EÌƒâ‚�).
Actually this expression can be simplified by using vector properties that I will remind in a few seconds.
KÃ—(KÃ—EÌƒâ‚�) = KÂ² 
- the modulus of <i>KÂ²</i>, and then the tensor KK/KÂ² minus the unity dyad, times EÌƒâ‚�.
What do I mean with the KK tensor?
Component by component, it's the matrix that has the i j element, the value K i K j , and which we can write using the XYZ coordinates as Kx, KxKy, KxKz, KxKy, KyÂ² and so on.
And the unit dyad is the matrix that has the delta Kronecker as the i j element that is the identity matrix.
And now, by using these vector properties we can expand this KÃ—(KÃ—EÌƒâ‚�), and by multiplying (cÂ²/Ï‰Â²), we find
-cÂ² KÂ²/Ï‰Â² and then this term here, times Eâ‚� Fourier transformed [i.e. EÌƒâ‚�].
Then here, recalling that (Îµâ‚€Âµâ‚€)â�»Â¹ = cÂ², this can be written as i/(Îµâ‚€ Ï‰) jÌƒâ‚� + EÌƒâ‚�
This quantity here is an dimensionless number and we will denote with NÂ², and this is actually the index of refraction.
What have we found?
We've found the relation between the electric field and the current.
Somehow we have to work from the fluid side to try to get a relation between the current and the electric field,
-a second relation, such that by using both equations, we will be able to derive the dispersion relation, the relation that will relate Ï‰, the [angular] frequency of the waves, or the instability that we are analyzing, and their wavenumber.
So now our goal is to derive a relation between the plasma current and the electric field by using the fluid equations.
We will focus on a relatively simple case of the two-fluid model: the one of the cold plasma.
We will therefore neglect all the terms related to the finite ion temperature.
In other words, we will put the temperature of both electrons and ions equal to zero.
This will considerably simplify our study without losing much of the physics that is behind waves and the instability described by the two-fluid model.
So we consider the two-fluid equations in the limit of temperature equal to zero.
Our goal is to obtain a relation between jÌƒâ‚�, the plasma current, and the electric field EÌƒâ‚�.
We expect that this relation will be a linear relation that will pass through Ïƒ, that is the conductivity, that in general can be a tensor.
That is, the mass of the species s times the convective derivative of us, this has to be equal to the electric force plus the Lorentz force.
We will neglect the pressure term according to the hypothesis of having the plasma temperature equal to zero.
And this equation will be written for the species that are present in our plasma that we will assume to be the ions and electrons.
We will assume that we are considering a static equilibrium, therefore with usâ‚€ = 0, that there is no electric field at equilibrium.
So basically, the plasma will be neutral, in steady state, so the species will have the same density, and therefore the equilibrium electric field will be equal to zero.
But we will assume there are at least the presence of an equilibrium magnetic field B that we assume to be uniform and we will choose our coordinate system in such a way that B becomes aligned to the ez direction.
Now, we can linearize our equation.
This term is higher order, a second order in perturbation only this one, the âˆ‚/âˆ‚t remains.
Therefore, we have ms âˆ‚uÌƒsâ‚�/âˆ‚t is equal to the perturbed part of the forces, which will be given by qs EÌƒâ‚� + qs ... and then the Lorentz force.
And it's now time to Fourier transform this equation.
As usual, âˆ‚/âˆ‚t will become a -iÏ‰ term and therefore the Fourier component of uÌƒsâ‚� and EÌƒâ‚� we will have 
-iÏ‰ ms uÌƒsâ‚� = qs EÌƒâ‚� + qs (uÌƒsâ‚� x Bâ‚€)
From this moment on, as we will be only dealing with Fourier components uÌƒsâ‚� and EÌƒâ‚�,
<b> let's drop the tilde (~) notation for simplicity </b>.
Therefore, for the notation we will, for example, denote EÌƒâ‚�,
Fourier transformed simply as Eâ‚�,
[EÌƒâ‚�(K,Ï‰) â†’ Eâ‚�(K,Ï‰)] but we will keep in mind that this is the Fourier transform of Eâ‚�, and more particularly, the (K,Ï‰) mode.
Now since (usâ‚� x Bâ‚€) can be written component by component as Bâ‚€ (usâ‚�y ex - usâ‚�x ey), this equation can be written as -iÏ‰, 
(i.e. the âˆ‚/âˆ‚t term), that will be a diagonal term, then we can bring the contribution of this term on the left-hand side and what we will find is a -Î©s
[cyclotron frequency for species s] and Î©s here,
0, 0 ..... â€¢ usâ‚� = qs/ms Eâ‚� where we leave on the right-hand side the Eâ‚� term.
Just as a reminder, the Î©s that we have introduced here, the cyclotron frequency, is equal to qs Bâ‚€ / ms .
Therefore, we can explicitly write usâ‚� by inverting this matrix here. usâ‚� will be equal qs ms ... times the inverse of this matrix.
The inverse of the matrix times qs ms can be defined as a tensor we call Î¼s,
...Î¼s Eâ‚� ...., where this tensor, Î¼s is equal to qs ms ... .
And if you evaluate the inverse of this matrix
-- thing that is a bit boring, but it's feasible, you get - iÏ‰/ (Î©sÂ²-Ï‰Â²) ,
Î©s / (Î©sÂ²-Ï‰Â²) , 0, and so on.
We will call this tensor the <i>mobility tensor</i>, as it will tell us how a particle will start to move a subject to a certain electric field.
Actually now it's possible to evaluate the perturbed current in the plasma because the perturbed current
-as the equilibrium flow is equal to zero, will be given by the sum over all species of qs [times] the equilibrium density
[ nsâ‚€, times] usâ‚�.
This is the only terms that remains from the linearization of the current, and now, we can write usâ‚� in terms of the mobility tensor and the electric field, ... times Eâ‚�.
This quantity here is actually a tensor Ïƒ Eâ‚�.
We have, in fact, obtained exactly the relation we were looking for.
And Ïƒ , by the way, is the <i>conductivity tensor</i>.
We have now all the elements to derive the dispersion relation that is the function that gives us the relation between Ï‰ and K, the frequency and the wave number of the modes that are intrinsically present in the system.
What we have to do is in fact to inject that the expression of the plasma current that we have derived within the two-fluid model into the Maxwell equations.
In fact, by the linearization of the Maxwell equation, we have obtained that
-NÂ² (the index of refraction) ... times this tensor here ... â‹… Eâ‚� is equal to the contribution of the plasma current and the electric field.
And from the fluid equation we have a relation between jâ‚� and Eâ‚�.
We can plug this expression here, and what we obtain is ... where we have introduced the Îµ tensor which will take into account the contribution from the conductivity, and this term here.
And now we have all the elements to derive-- to write down the equation for the dispersion relation of the two-fluid model.
In fact, the modes that have a frequency and a wavenumber such that the determinant of this matrix here which we can call D(Ï‰,K) = 0, so the modes whose frequency and wavenumber are such that the determinant of this matrix is equal to zero, then these are intrinsically present modes, i.e. modes which can be present in our system, and they can have an Eâ‚� different from zero.
Solving this equation will actually tell us what is the relation between the frequency and the wavenumber of these modes.
Before concluding, let me just write explicitly what is the value of Îµ by introducing the conductivity that we have found.
This can be written by introducing three parameters:
Îµâ‚�, Îµâ‚‚, and Îµâ‚ƒ, where Îµâ‚� is defined as one plus the sum over all species of the plasma frequency of species s,
[squared], divided by the cyclotron frequency [squared] minus Ï‰Â².
I just remind you that the plasma frequency squared of species <i>s</i> is equal to nsâ‚€, the equilibrium density,
[times] the charge squared, divided by the mass [ms] and Îµâ‚€.
Îµâ‚‚ is equal to minus the sum 
[over species] of the cyclotron frequency over the frequency of the wave,
[times the] plasma frequency [squared] divided by the difference between the cyclotron frequency squared and the frequency of the wave squared.
And Îµâ‚ƒ, finally, will be given by 1 minus the [sim over species] of plasma frequencies squared divided by Ï‰Â².
To summarize, in the present module, what we have done is to linearize and
Fourier transform the Maxwell equations and the two-fluid equations, in order to come up with a dispersion relation, a relation between the frequency of the wave number of the modes, of the waves and instability that are intrinsically present in our system.
In the next module, we will consider exactly what are the waves and instabilities present in our system and we will look at their physical properties.
