We'll now solve the problem for any n.
We define Ï†0, Ï†1, ..., Ï†n the Lagrange basis for polynomials of degree n, Pn, which depends on the points t0, t1, t2,..., tn.
Take an integer k, between 0 and n k is fixed. Then Ï†k is a degree n polynomial defined as follows : we want
Ï†k(tk)=1 and Ï†k(tj)=0 for all tj with the subscript j different from k, and between 0 and n.
The formula for Ï†k is the following 
Ï†k(t) is the product on j from 0 to n, j different from k, the numerator is of the type (t-tj) such that Ï†k(tj)=0 and on the denominator we have tk-tj, so that Ï†k(tk)=1.
I claim now that Ï†0, Ï†1, Ï†2, ..., Ï†n is a basis for polynomials of degree n.
The dimension of the space of degree n polynomials is n+1 because any polynomial of degree n is a linear combination of the functions
1, t, t^2, ..., t^n so there are n+1 functions in the basis, so the dimension of Pn is n+1
So we just need to check that
Ï†0, Ï†1, Ï†2, ..., Ï†n are linearly independant
Take any coefficients Î±0, Î±1, ..., Î±n and a linear combination 
Î±0*Ï†0 +Î±1*Ï†1 +...+Î±n*Ï†n
Suppose this linear combination is 0
That is to say 0 for all t in R.
We must show that this implies that all the coefficients Î±0, Î±1, ..., Î±n are 0. I choose for example t=t0 and I get Ï†0(t0)=1, 
Ï†1(t0)=0, ... Ï†n(tn)=0 so
Î±0*Ï†0(t0)+Î±1*Ï†(t1)+...+Î±n*Ï†(tn)
 = a0*1+Î±1*0+...+Î±n*0=Î±0
So I get Î±0=0.
Likewise if I choose t=t1 I get Î±1=0 and so on.
So I indeed showed that those functions are linearly independant.
Recall that I am looking for a polynomial of degree n going through and I claim the solution of the problem is given by p(t). p(t) is a degree n polynomial so we can write it as a linear combination of the basis functions Ï†0, Ï†1, ..., Ï†n and the coefficients of the linear combinations are the values p0, p1, ..., pn so p(t) = p0*Ï†0(t)+p1*Ï†1(t)+ ... +pn*Ï†n(t).
We can indeed check that it is the solution to our problem.
Firsly, this polynomial is a linear combination of the functions
Ï†0, Ï†1, ..., Ï†n the Lagrange basis, so it is a polynomial of degree n. And I must check that p(tj)=pj.  For instance, let us show that p(t0)=p0 p(t0)=p0*Ï†0(t0)+p1*Ï†1(t0)+...+pn*Ï†n(tn) but Ï†0(t0)=1, Ï†1(t0)=0, ..., Ï†n(t0)=0 so we have p(t0)=p0. and we continue likewise until
 we get p(tn)=pn
