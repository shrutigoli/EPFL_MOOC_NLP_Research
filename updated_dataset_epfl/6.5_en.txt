We hope that you enjoyed this week with us.
Thank you for your participation.
I would like you to focus on the concept presented in the unit.
Once these concepts are clearly understood including the application of these concepts, you can take the final test of the unit.
And I'd like to remind you on the focus on space telescopes with the interviews of Carol Christian,
Outreach Project Scientist for the Hubble Space Telescope, and John Mather,
Senior Project Scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope, the successor to Hubble, and Nobel Prize winner in Physics for his work on COBE with George Smoot.
