In this part we introduce options on swaps, so called swaptions.
We study the notion of moneyness.
We see when there's a swaption at money, out of the money, and in the money.
We will also see how swaptions can be used to synthetically create callable bonds.
We will review Black's and 
Bachelier's price formulas and finally see how swaptions are quoted in terms of their Black and Bachelier implied volatilities.
A payer swaption with strike rate <i>K</i> gives the holder the right to enter a payer swap with fixed rate <i>K</i> at the swaption expiry date.
Usually the swaption expiry date equals the first reset date
<i>T-0</i> of the underlying swap.
Well let us assume that 
<i>T-0</i> is here and the swap has a length of 
<i>T-n</i> - <i>T-0</i>.
It pays a fixed rate <i>K</i>. at cash flow dates, and it receives floating at the same dates.
This leads to a value of this swap at time <i>T-0</i> that can be positive or negative.
You will exercise the swaption at expiry date <i>T-0</i> only if this value is positive.
So let us have a closer look at the payer swaption pay off at expiry date <i>T-0</i>.
The value of the payer swap is shown here without the plus sign.
The holder of the swaption will only exercise the option to enter the payer swap if this value is positive, hence the payer swaption pay off is the positive part of this value.
Now notice that this pay off cannot be decomposed
 into more elementary pay offs.
As was the case for caps and floors.
This is because the positive part of the sum is not the same as the sum of the positive parts.
From this we saw that the dependence between the different forward rates will enter the valuation procedure of a swaption.
Now recall that an equivalent expression for the value of the payer swap is given in terms of the swap rate which is shown here without a plus sign.
Hence an equivalent expression for the payer swaption pay off at expiry date <i>T-0</i> is what is shown here with the plus sign.
This leads us to the following convention.
We say a payer swaption is at the money if the strike rate is equal to the prevailing forward swap rate.
The payer swaption is said to be in the money if the strike rate is smaller than this forward swap rate and out of the money if the strike rate is larger than the forward swap rate.
For the receiver swaption it is the converse.
There is also the convention to call the swaption that has expiry in <i>X</i> years and an underlying swap length of <i>Y</i> years the <i>X</i> year into <i>Y</i> year swaption.
Here is an application.
Swaptions can be used to synthetically create callable bonds.
Let's illustrate that with an example.
Suppose a company has issued a 10 year bond with a 4% annual coupon on the principal of <i>n</i>.
Now suppose that the company wants to add the right to prepay or call the bond at par after 5 years but the company cannot change the original bond.
Let's look at the situation the company faces after 5 years sitting at this time point.
The company is facing cash flows,
4% annual coupons on the notional of <i>N</i>.
The company wants to add the option to get rid of these payments of these 4% annual coupons and instead pay the notional 
<i>N</i> at date 5.
Now notice that the value of the bond at time 5 is given by the expression here.
Formally speaking this is the same as the notional
<i>N</i> plus the value at time 5 of a receiver swap of length 5 years.
Now the company will only call the bond at par that means at value <i>N</i> if the value of the receiver swap is positive.
Now here is the solution.
The company can buy a 5 year into
5 year receiver swaption with a strike rate of 4%.
The pay off of this swaption at expiry date 5 is just the positive part of the value of the receiver swap that was seen on the previous slide.
From a cash flow point of view this is also clear.
Suppose the company exercises the swaption, enters the receiver swap, then the company will receive the 4% coupons on these 5 years.
And it will pay floating instead.
At the fixed leg payments cancels with the 4% coupon payments on the bond and we know from the previous part that paying the notional <i>N</i> at time 5 is equivalent to paying the notional
<i>N</i> at time 10 and floating in between.
Here is Black's formula for payer and receiver swaptions where Î¦ denotes the standard normal cumulative distribution function and the parameters <i>d-1</i> and <i>d-2</i> are given here.
Again this formula has one volatility parameter.
It's Ïƒ and is called Black volatility or relative volatility.
The underlying modeling assumptions for Black's formula which was log normality under the forward measure for caplets and floorlets is now different.
Here, it is log normality of the swap rate but under a different measure then the forward measure.
So we refrain from deriving it here.
Bachelier's formula for payer and swaption prices is shown here where Î¦ is the standard normal cumulative distribution function, 
Ï† is the normal density and the parameter <i>D</i> is given here.
Again there is a single volatility parameter Ïƒ called the normal volatility.
Swaption prices are quoted in terms the Black or normal implied volatilities.
The accrued period Î´ for the underlying swap can differ from prevailing 'Î´'s for caps within the same region.
For example, in the Eurozone caps are typically written on semi annual LIBOR where Î´ is equal to 6 months while swaps pay annual coupons such that the Î´ is 1.
Here is an example of swaption quotes in terms of Black's implied volatilities of at the money swaptions in the Eurozone in August 2013.
Maturities range from 
1 to 10 years, and the swap length from
1 to 10 years.
So the first row gives us the 1 year into 1 year
2 years, 3 years, and so on to
10 years swaption quotes in percentage points in terms
Black's implied volatilities.
The matrix of values is illustrated in the figure on the right hand side.
An interest rate model for swaptions valuation must fit such a given volatility surface.
Here are the normal implied volatilities of the same at the money swaptions in the Euro-zone in August 2013.
