Today we will look at the orbital lifetime of satellites.
Satellites on a low Earth orbit.
Low Earth orbit means between about 200 kilometers and 2,000 kilometers. And all the satellites within this range of altitude have a slow decay of their orbit because of the atmospheric drag. They are basically in the high ionosphere, and the decrease in altitude will be such that there will be on one hand an increase of the orbital speed, there will be a denser atmosphere, so increased drag.
Its process is such that although it starts slowly at the end it goes very rapidly and it ends up with a fiery reentry of the satellite in the atmosphere, a destructive reentry.
Now we'll consider only a circular orbit, a low Earth orbit, but of a circular shape. Obviously if you have a highly elliptical orbit you are going to have more decay in the perigee of the orbit and very little at the apogee, and itâ€™s a more complex process but we'll consider circular orbits.
Here we have a very classical expression of the force of drag using aerodynamics.
In fact in aerodynamics you have the same for lift and for drag, but here we'll consider only drag. The force of drag is equal to the dynamic pressure,
<i>1/2Ï�V&sup2; </i>times the drag coefficient,
<i>C_D</i>, and the so-called reference area <i>A_n</i>, which is basically the area of the satellite or the spacecraft exposed to the air, or perpendicular to the velocity vector.
And you have the expression of the force of drag, and obviously the acceleration will be the force divided by <i>m</i>. 
And you can express that drag acceleration is the dynamic pressure,
<i>1/2Ï�V&sup2;</i>  divided by the so-called ballistic coefficient, in kilogram per square meter.
Here we have the ballistic coefficient, so it's the mass of the spacecraft divided by the drag coefficient and this so-called reference area.
Now you have to understand that the higher the ballistic coefficient, the longer the lifetime of the satellite. 
The ballistic coefficient to a certain degree is a measure of the resistance of the spacecraft to the decay of the orbit due to the high atmosphere.
Now, a definition of An, you have it on the upper right.
Once again it's the area of the spacecraft perpendicular to the velocity vector, and depending on the shape of the spacecraft you have different values of the drag coefficient. And we have the case of an elongated object with a long axis in the direction of the velocity vector where you have a low drag coefficient. You have a medium drag coefficient for a sphere, and a high drag coefficient if you have a plate or for instance a solar array, with the plane of the plate perpendicular to the velocity vector. The values of the drag coefficient are normally between
2 and 4. You have two for a sphere.
This is the result of modelling of the lifetime of a satellite, and again the lifetime is the time between the installation of the satellite on a circular orbit at a certain height above the Earth's surface until the end of the decay and the return to Earth, again a destructive return to the Earth.
As a function of the starting altitude of the orbit, again we consider only circular orbits here. Now, you have different curves here, and you have sets of curves corresponding to three different values of the ballistic coefficient.
You have a low ballistic coefficient of 20kg per square meter, you have a medium ballistic coefficient of 65kg per square meter, and a high ballistic coefficient of 200kg per square meter.
Again, the high ballistic coefficient corresponds to a better resistance of the satellite against the decay of the orbit due to the friction of the atmosphere. So a longer lifetime for a high ballistic coefficient.
If we look at the high altitude above, about 700 kilometers above the Earth's surface, obviously we have the high ballistic coefficient curve, which gives us a much longer lifetime than the low value.
Now it's interesting to see for the medium altitude, typically between 300 and 600 kilometers altitude, we have a split, depending on whether the installation of the orbit of the satellite was at solar minimum or solar maximum.
If I consider now the curve corresponding to 200kg per square meter, we see that at around 550 kilometers altitude and below, if you launch at solar minimum, you have a much longer lifetime.
This is this part of the curve. 
Then if you launch at solar maximum, obviously because of the expansion of the atmosphere, for the medium altitudes, typically between 200 and 600 kilometers altitude, the fact of the expansion of the atmosphere has a definite effect on the lifetime of the satellite.
So, again at high altitude it's not a factor, at very low altitude, at around
200 kilometers, the effect of the time when you launch the satellite versus the solar maximum or solar minimum is unimportant, but this factor is important for the medium altitude, between about 300 to 600 kilometers.
Here the data for some satellites, which give you the cross-sectional area, which we call the reference area. 
We have the values here in square meters.
The drag coefficient for the max cross area, for the min cross area, and the ballistic coefficient you have the values here.
Now if you have a spherical satellite, which is the case for Explorer-17, spherical satellites, as already mentioned have a drag coefficient of 2, and you see that the maximum drag coefficient that you can have is about 4, so drag coefficients are always comprised between 2 and 4.
So these are values of reference which are of interest, obviously, if you have cylindrical satellites you are going to have a different drag coefficient depending on the orientation of the cylinder versus the velocity vector.
Just for information, the International
Space Station ballistic coefficient is approximately 50 kilograms per square meter. That's a minimum value when it has the lowest drag possible, with basically the so-called x body vector of the
International Space Station in the direction of the velocity vector.
