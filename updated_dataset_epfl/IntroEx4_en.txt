Welcome to the exercises for the fourth week of the course on
Plasma Physics and Applications.
During this week's lectures you have seen examples of static ideal MHD equilibria.
You saw that the simplest case is the force free equilibrium where the plasma Beta is so low that the pressure term can be neglected in the force balanced equation.
An example of such force free equilibria are these impressive magnetic flux tubes which can be observed on the surface of the Sun.
In the first exercise you will derive an interesting relation between magnetic field and current in this equilibria.
You have also derived the waves which can occur in a uniform ideal MHD plasma, namely the sheer alpha-n wave, the fast compressional alpha-n wave, and the slow magnetosonic wave.
Two velocities appear in the dispersion relations of these waves, the alpha-n velocity and the sound speed.
In the second exercise this week we ask you to calculate these quantities for a fusion plasma.
Finally, in the last exercise of this week we will develop a more intuitive understanding of the shear alpha-n wave.
You will see that in shear alpha-n waves the magnetic field lines vibrate just like the strings of a guitar.
In an ungraded bonus part, you will furthermore show that the plasma perfectly follows these oscillations of the field lines as if the particles were stuck to the field lines.
I wish you good luck.
