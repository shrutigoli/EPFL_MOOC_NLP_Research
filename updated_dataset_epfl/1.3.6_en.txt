The first important caveat is that when you have heteromeric channels, the combinations are vast which means it is very unlikely we can measure them all, so we do need to find indirect ways to determine the kinetics of all the heteromeric channels.
The second caveat is that to obtain very good ion channel data, kinetic data, it needs a lot of standardization.
So you will find a big discrepancy of ion channel data in the literature, and it is largely due to different standards being applied in different laboratories.
The third caveat is that classifications is still a murky ground, to classify different neurons electrically, morphologically, molecularly...
And ultimately we would need single cell gene expression patterns, what we call single cell transcriptomes which is close, but it is not yet a solved problem.
So, to summarize, in this lecture, you learned a little bit that there are many different ion channel genes, that each produce different kinetics, the electrical properties of a neuron is determined by the kinetics of each ion channel, by the combination of ion channels that you put into a neuron, by the location where you put them, and the densities of each ion channel type.
If you know how the ion channel genes are expressed in a neuron, you can actually calculate electrical properties.
And you also learned how to obtain the density of neurons, or at least got an idea how we obtain density of neurons.
Okay, that is it for today.
