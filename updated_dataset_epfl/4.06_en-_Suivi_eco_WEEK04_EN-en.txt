The TaÃ¯ National Park, or TNP, is located in the southwest of CÃ´te d'Ivoire.
With each extension of the zoo fauna reserve in the north, the TNP covers a surface area of around 536 thousand hectares.
Or of a 1.3 million acres.
It is the largest protected primary rain forest in West Africa.
The park has been listed to the international network of Biosphere Reserves in 1978, and World Heritage site in 1982, in the framework of the MAB
UNESCO program shows how important it is.
For this case study, we'll be looking at the 10 phase ecological monitoring program, implemented in the TaÃ¯ National Park between 2005 and 2015, to monitor all of the animal populations.
This case is based on the result of data collected during phase 4, which took place between August 2008 and February 2009, as well as those from phases 2 and 3.
We will specifically look at the duikers value.
Ecological monitoring in the TaÃ� National Park aims at assessing the following ecological attributes:
What is the duiker population size within the park?
What types of threats do they face in the park?
How are these threats and duiker populations distributed inside the park?
The ecological monitoring method used to inform on these
3 ecological attributes is based on a total sweep of the park, following transects.
The aim was to look both for direct and indirect indicators of duiker populations and other animal populations.
Related pressures were also noted.
This illustration shows the layout of different transect groups throughout the park.
So, 368 kilometers of transects divided into 5 zones were roamed by sampling teams working simultaneously.
Each transect measures 2 kilometers.
They are led out regularly throughout the park in groups of 4, separated by 8 kilometers.
And within a group, transects are separated by 1 kilometer.
The data analysis mainly consisted in calculating encounter rates and proportions from the raw data, in order to estimate the population size of duikers in the park.
The Maxwell's duiker remains the most prevalent species with 0.52 individual per kilometer.
The bay duiker is the second most encountered species.
And the scarcest ones are the yellow-backed duikers and the zebra duikers.
To get an idea of a distribution of species in the park, simple distribution maps were drawn up from ArcGis 9.2 software, by combining geographical coordinates with the observations made by transects
Just as in phases 2 and 3, indicators of duiker presence were found throughout the TaÃ¯ National Park.
Areas with higher concentration, meaning more than 
10 indicators per kilometer, were mainly in the east, as opposed to phase 2 where there were almost no zone with high concentration of indicators.
This situation could be a sign of progressive recolonization of duikers in the entire
TaÃ¯ National Park.
The total number of observations made on these transects is important, and reaches over 11 thousand, all species included.
Most were bovines with 39% of observations.
By the way, during this phase, the number of direct observations has practically doubled, going from 282 during the previous phase, to 484.
Human activities, essentially illegal activities, like hunting, mining and so on, represented only 4% of recorded observations.
But the most encountered indicators of human activities were trucks with 300 observations, traps with 171 observations, and (INAUDIBLE) with 131 observations.
Even though there were more indicators of fauna attacks during phase 4,
319 of total observations, the critical encounter rate of one indicator rate per kilometer, was not reached.
Furthermore, the encounter rate of poaching trails was reduced by more than half.
And in phase 4, went from 1.01 per kilometer, to 0.42 per kilometer.
As for traps, their encounter rate did not change much, but was slowly decreasing.
Going from 0.55 in phase 3, to 0.47 per kilometer in phase 4.
The analysis of hunting indicator distribution, however, shows that in all phases there are areas with higher rates of attacks.
In phase 4, these areas are mainly located at the periphery of the park.
In all 3 phases, the research area shows a very low rate of hunting indicators, probably thanks to regular presence of humans and to man-made actions implemented in the park. 
Other animals, such as apes,
24% of observations, and birds, 18% of observations, were also observed a lot.
But this is not true for elephants, with only 1% of observations.
Either because there are very few individuals of this species in the park, or because the monitoring methods is not useful to assess its ecological attributes.
To finish off, we can see that over the course of a couple of years, the encounter rate of duikers has been increasing in the TaÃ� National Park while indicators of attacks have stabilized or fallen.
These results are undoubtfully a result of management decisions that were implemented to protect the duiker value, used here as an example of all animal populations, and to reduce the threats weighing against it.
This would hence be a demonstration of the park's success.
