Hello and welcome to this seventh and last module of the MOOC on managing protected areas in Africa.
This module is about what we have called the topical issues of protected areas, namely the hot topics of today.
These have been covered in previous modules, in more or less detail.
So this week, the module focuses on the following subjects.
The first lesson will be on climate change.
What is it?
How does it impact protected areas?
How can they mitigate climate change?
In the second lesson we will look at the connectivity of protected areas and associated concepts, of buffer zones, resilience, etc.
The restoration of protected areas, which has unfortunately become essential in numerous sites, is the subject of the third lesson.
In the fourth lesson we will learn about equity, particularly, gender equity because, in protected areas, as well as in other places, equity must be a key notion in decisions and the way they are made.
The fifth lesson will address the difficult issue of corruption and the trafficking it generates within protected areas.
The sixth lesson is this week's convention, the very last one and we will talk this time about the Ramsar
Convention, which deals with wetlands.
And finally, the traditional summary of the important points, covered this week, will be offered in the form of an animation, followed by a conclusion of this MOOC when we will attempt to review everything we have looked at together.
So here we go, have a great seventh week with us.
