1
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:23,998
Good morning.

2
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:28,951
I am pleased to present a case study

3
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:35,528
covering the biodiversity of
Senegal-Mauritania.

4
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:46,279
The purpose of this lesson is to
illustrate the role and contributions

5
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,785
of geographic information systems

6
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:56,492
in a biodiversity conservation project.

7
00:00:56,692 --> 00:01:03,029
<i> We will break down
the presentation plan </ i></i>

8
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:08,179
<i> of this case study where
we will first </ i></i>

9
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,585
<i> talk about the Senegal
river valley, </ i></i>

10
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:16,602
<i> then break down the objectives </ i></i>

11
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:20,820
<i> to describe the methodology
that was used </ i></i>

12
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,909
<i> and finally present the results. </ I></i>

13
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:36,172
<i> We are in a part of the world
called the Sahel </ i></i>

14
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:41,010
<i> that has no major interest </ i></i>

15
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,747
<i> in terms of biodiversity. </ I></i>

16
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:49,493
<i> Fortunately today, </ i></i>

17
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:55,684
<i> there is attention given
to these areas. </ I></i>

18
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:59,410
<i> And so we will look </ i></i>

19
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,331
<i> at the Senegal river valley </ i></i>

20
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:11,018
<i> that extends, for the part
that we are interested in, </ i></i>

21
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:15,462
<i> from the Senegal river
delta to Bakel </ i></i>

22
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:21,637
on a strip of 50 kilometers
on either side of the Senegal river

23
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:27,375
over an area of ​​60,000 km2.

24
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:33,111
<i> So this is an area that
provides a habitat for unique species. </ I></i>

25
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:35,800
<i> We have, in the Senegal
river valley, </ i></i>

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
<i> an ecosystem diversity. </ I></i>

27
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,200
<i> We have 4 types of ecosystems. </ I></i>

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,400
<i> We have the sandy Ferlo,
the lateritic Ferlo, </ i></i>

29
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
<i> we also have floodplains </ i></i>

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,557
<i> and wetlands. </ I></i>

31
00:02:50,757 --> 00:02:56,572
<i> This diversity of ecosystems
in the valley </ i></i>

32
00:02:56,772 --> 00:03:00,383
<i> is linked particularly
to climatic variations, </ i></i>

33
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:05,533
<i> to geological and
pedological variations. </ I></i>

34
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:09,359
<i> In this part of
the Senegal river valley, </ i></i>

35
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:12,806
<i> we also have a diversity
of ethnic groups and lifestyles. </ I></i>

36
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:16,860
<i> We have the Soninkés, Toucouleurs,
Fulanis, Wolofs, Moors </ i></i>

37
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:19,040
<i> which are different ethnic groups. </ I></i>

38
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:21,361
<i> We also have sedentary farmers, </ i></i>

39
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:25,120
<i> breeders, diversity
of agricultural activities, </ i></i>

40
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:28,295
<i> the cultivation of rice,
millet, sugar cane. </ I></i>

41
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:31,989
<i> We also have
extensive farming, fishing. </ I></i>

42
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:46,807
We will stop a little on
the objectives of the project.

43
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:52,238
First to say that in this area
of ​​the Senegal river valley,

44
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:55,704
there was a loss of biodiversity

45
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:59,819
due to the expansion of agriculture,

46
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:07,349
the increasing use of some
tree essences in construction.

47
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:10,162
Regarding the objectives of the project,

48
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:14,131
we first have preservation
of biodiversity

49
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:17,331
through the restoration
of degraded soils.

50
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:23,089
Our goal is also sustainable
ecosystem management

51
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:27,653
with the involvement
of the population.

52
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:31,209
Finally, a contribution to
the fight against poverty

53
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:36,436
by the generation, the creation
of new sources of income.

54
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:41,314
Information systems have an important role

55
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,514
in achieving these objectives

56
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:51,246
since GIS have the role
of collecting and storing data,

57
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:55,128
communication and information sharing,

58
00:04:55,328 --> 00:05:01,014
and also the analysis of
land use and its dynamic.

59
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:12,866
<i> Regarding the approach followed </ i></i>

60
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:17,834
<i> in the case of the
analysis of land use, </ i></i>

61
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,683
<i> 4 steps must be emphasized. </ I></i>

62
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:25,339
<i> The first step is the selection
and processing of images </ i></i>

63
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:29,803
<i> the second step, the
supervised classification, </ i></i>

64
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:33,003
<i> the third step, the
diachronic analysis </ i></i>

65
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:36,203
<i> and the fourth step, the
vectorization, digitalization </ i></i>

66
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,680
<i> and addition of vectorial layers. </ I></i>

67
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:48,390
<i> With regards to the selection
step and the image processing, </ i></i>

68
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:55,063
<i> you should know that
we used Landsat images, </ i></i>

69
00:05:55,263 --> 00:06:00,525
<i> 30 m resolution
with several spectral bands. </ I></i>

70
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:06,629
<i> The optimal acquisition period
of these images </ i></i>

71
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:09,950
<i> is between mid-October
and late December. Why? </ I></i>

72
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,566
<i> Because that is when
the wood cover </ i></i>

73
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:19,041
<i> still keeps its leaves. </ I></i>

74
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:26,296
<i> It is also at this time
that crop areas </ i></i>

75
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:29,412
<i> are easily recognizable. </ I></i>

76
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:35,965
<i> We have also done
mosaic images </ i></i>

77
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:39,165
<i> since considering the extent
of the study area, </ i></i>

78
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:45,746
<i> we had to have 7 Landsat scenes
to cover the study area </ i></i>

79
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:52,709
<i> and so it was necessary to do
a mosaic of these 7 Landsat scenes. </ I></i>

80
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:59,976
<i> After the image processing step, </ i></i>

81
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:07,356
<i> there is the supervised
classification step </ i></i>

82
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:14,126
<i> with a combination of spectral bands </ i></i>

83
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:17,326
<i> and field studies </ i></i>

84
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:23,638
<i> to identify the characteristic
reference areas. </ I></i>

85
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:27,713
<i> There is also the identification </ i></i>

86
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:33,076
<i> of the spectral signature
of the reference areas </ i></i>

87
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:37,527
<i> and finally, the generalization
of these signatures </ i></i>

88
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,242
<i> for the entire study area. </ I></i>

89
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:46,937
After the supervised
classification step,

90
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:50,137
we carry out a diachronic analysis.

91
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:54,617
What is this analysis?

92
00:07:54,817 --> 00:08:00,119
<i> It consists in counting </ i></i>

93
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:07,825
<i> surfaces / pixels
in each land use category. </ I></i>

94
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:13,059
<i> Next, there is an overlay
of raster layers </ i></i>

95
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:19,583
<i> to highlight the pixels
that have changed land use </ i></i>

96
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:25,431
<i> between the two dates,
that is to say between 1984 and 2003. </ I></i>

97
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:31,434
<i> Still in this methodology part, </ i></i>

98
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:36,879
<i> we also have 3 other steps </ i></i>

99
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:46,071
<i> not less important in the
elaboration of vectorial layers. </ I></i>

100
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:51,611
<i> It is first the vectorization
of land use. </ I></i>

101
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:58,014
<i> Then digitalizing certain elements </ i></i>

102
00:08:58,214 --> 00:09:06,811
<i> like road networks,
some localities, etc. </ I></i>

103
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:10,322
<i> and also the integration
of external sources </ i></i>

104
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:19,039
<i> since there are layers,
data layers </ i></i>

105
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:22,064
<i> that exist in other institutions </ i></i>

106
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:27,072
<i> such as the administrative limits. </ I></i>

107
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:32,524
<i> Thirdly, we also try to integrate </ i></i>

108
00:09:32,736 --> 00:09:34,384
<i> these external sources. </ I></i>

109
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:49,123
<i> And for the results obtained: </ i></i>

110
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:56,804
<i> let's stop for a moment
on the land use of 1984. </ I></i>

111
00:09:57,004 --> 00:10:03,679
<i> What we should say is that
the classification of satellite imagees </ i></i>

112
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:08,706
<i> brings out 7 vegetation types. </ I></i>

113
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:16,250
<i> The other terms favorable
to the existence of habitats </ i></i>

114
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,993
<i> are related to surface waters. </ I></i>

115
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:27,042
<i> The ecosystems still reflect
a certain diversity. </ I></i>

116
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:33,821
<i> On the map of 2003, the same number
of classes as in 1984 </ i></i>

117
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:39,078
<i> was listed. This shows that
the evolution of the environment </ i></i>

118
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,802
<i> has not resulted in theme
appearances or disappearances, </ i></i>

119
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:48,869
<i> the natural information among
which the shrub steppe </ i></i>

120
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:51,589
<i> composing by far the first class. </ I></i>

121
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:54,098
<i> That is also important to note. </ I></i>

122
00:10:54,298 --> 00:10:59,121
<i> Between 1984 and 2003, </ i></i>

123
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:04,731
<i> major changes in the occupancy
and use of the space </ i></i>

124
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:10,733
<i> took place in the Senegal
river basin in general </ i></i>

125
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:13,829
<i> and the delta and valley
in particular. </ I></i>

126
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:18,783
<i> So between 1984 and 2003,
major modifications </ i></i>

127
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:21,713
<i> in the occupation and
use of space </ i></i>

128
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:27,816
<i> took place in the Senegal
river valley and delta. </ I></i>

129
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:31,754
<i> These changes can be detected
through the variations, </ i></i>

130
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:34,961
<i> increases or decreases
of the surfaces </ i></i>

131
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:39,504
<i> the different types
of occupancy, land use </ i></i>

132
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:44,412
<i> that have been highlighted
by the cartography of the area </ i></i>

133
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:49,758
<i> between these two dates,
that is to say between 1984 and 2003. </ I></i>

134
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:54,840
<i> Let's take the example of the mangrove.
It is a sparse mangrove formation </ i></i>

135
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,849
<i> that has gradually
deteriorated over time. </ I></i>

136
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:04,948
<i> And the mangrove has decreased
by 468 hectares between 1984 and 2003, </ i></i>

137
00:12:05,148 --> 00:12:10,339
<i> going from 1445 hectares
to 970 hectares </ i></i>

138
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:12,964
<i> at the rate of at least
about 25 hectares per year. </ I></i>

139
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:16,489
<i> The irrigated crops have also,
considerably developed, </ i></i>

140
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:19,801
<i> the greater availability
of water induced </ i></i>

141
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:23,001
<i>by the Diama and Manantali dams. </ I></i>

142
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:28,656
<i> And its extension was
mainly done at the expense </ i></i>

143
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:34,351
<i> of natural vegetal formations
in the floodplain, </ i></i>

144
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:38,758
<i> that is to say the shrub steppe
and what we can call</ i></i>

145
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,490
<i> the relic forests. </ I></i>

146
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:50,715
<i>Globally, we can say that
the water and the types of land use </ i></i>

147
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:53,682
<i> related to its presence,
aquatic vegetation, </ i></i>

148
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:58,245
<i> irrigated crops, bare
easily flooded soil, have increased </ i></i>

149
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:02,410
<i> whilst the terms such
as the natural vegetal formations </ i></i>

150
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,828
<i> that are more exposed
to entropic actions </ i></i>

151
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:08,776
<i> have substantially decreased. </ I></i>

152
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:12,891
<i> In terms of the spatial dynamic </ i></i>

153
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:17,445
<i> of land use between
those two dates, </ i></i>

154
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:23,284
<i> we must take into account</ i></i>

155
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:29,763
<i> the contrast between
the Diéri and Walo land. </ I></i>

156
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:36,572
<i> The Diéri is a toucouleur geographical
term </ i></i>

157
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:40,852
<i> which means non flooded
areas of the valley </ i></i>

158
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:47,261
<i> and the Walo means the
land cultivated </ i></i>

159
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:51,323
<i> in the area flooded by the annual
rains of the river. </ I></i>

160
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:54,523
<i> So it is very important
to take this opposition </ i></i>

161
00:13:54,723 --> 00:14:00,785
<i> into account when, </ i></i>

162
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:03,700
<i> the spatial dynamic is done. </ I></i>

163
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,900
<i> It is important
to take this contrast into account </ i></i>

164
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,719
<i> since the dry crop
areas are generally </ i></i>

165
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:19,940
<i> most threatened because
they totally depend on rainfall. </ I></i>

166
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:36,001
We have just presented
the objectives of the case study,

167
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:39,946
the methodology and the results.

168
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:44,352
What we can remember is that in total,

169
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:48,151
the study area consists of
different ecosystems

170
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:52,587
providing a habitat for hundreds
of animal and vegetal species,

171
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,740
so a very valuable biological
diversity for a zone

172
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,340
which is located next to the desert.

173
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,540
But natural resources have evolved
under the combined effects

174
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,113
of several processes where

175
00:15:10,313 --> 00:15:15,975
entropic actions and physical
factors are questioned.

176
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:18,837
And the analysis of production
systems revealed

177
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:21,983
a contrast between the Diéri
and the Walo

178
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:25,704
but especially a complementarity between
the scenes of agricultural production,

179
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:28,904
I will quote the agricultural surplus,

180
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:30,843
the irrigated agriculture
and livestock.

181
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:34,640
The multidate cartography
in the 200 thousandth

182
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,315
highlighted the major changes resulting

183
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:44,960
on one hand from the vegetal potential
that has been hit hard

184
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,785
between 1984 and 2003 and
on the other hand

185
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,630
from the relaxation of the water
resources mobilization constraint.
