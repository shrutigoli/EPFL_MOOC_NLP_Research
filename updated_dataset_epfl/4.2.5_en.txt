Let's summarize various steps of a journey from the Earth to another planet, let's say, the planet Mars.
This is a summary of what we covered already in the previous videos.
We had to start with the heliocentric trajectory from the Earth to the destination planet here and we had to consider that the sphere of influence of both the departure planet, the Earth, and the arrival planet, let's say, Mars, are very small compared to the scale of the solar system.
So we have the transfer ellipse, pretty much Hohmann transfer from the supposedly circular trajectory of the departure planet, the Earth to the near-circular trajectory of the destination planet Mars.
We just have a simplification here.
Now, we start with that heliocentric trajectory.
We have the velocity of the Earth here, which we know, is about 30 km/s, heliocentric trajectory.
Now, we know that in order to get this insertion to the elliptical transfer orbit of the destination planet we need to have a higher velocity, which I called <i>V_S departure</i> for spacecraft departure.
So the difference between <i>V_S departure</i> and the Earth is <i>v_dâˆž</i> which, in fact, is equal to what we call <i>V_1</i> of a Hohmann transfer between two circular orbits.
So it's really the supplement of velocity you need to give to the circular orbit of the departure planet in order to get to that transfer velocity toward the destination planet.
Once we had <i>v_d âˆž</i>, we have this here, we look now at what's happening in the sphere of influence of the departure planet, the Earth.
On the basis of <i>v_d âˆž</i> we can determine the value of <i>v_d</i>, the departure velocity from the parking orbit around the Earth in order to get to our journey toward the destination planet.
So, again, we start always with a heliocentric trajectory from departure to destination planet, and then we can infer in what's happening inside the sphere of influence, again, small compared to the scale of the solar system for the departure planet.
We do the same thing for the arrival.
We have the velocity of the spacecraft at arrival, which is here.
We have the velocity of the destination planet, which in our case is larger than the velocity at arrival.
If we go to Mars and if we have this elliptical trajectory between the Earth and Mars, the semi-major axis of this elliptical transfer trajectory is smaller than the radius of the supposedly circular orbit of Mars.
So the energy is less, so at that point, when we arrive at the planet, we have the same potential energy, we are at the same distance to the Sun, so our kinetic energy is going to be less.
So we arrive with default in velocity compared with the velocity to the planet.
If you are on your spaceship arriving to Mars and you are looking in the direction of the velocity vector, in fact, the planet will catch you up from behind.
Your heliocentric velocity is less than the velocity of the destination planet.
I am talking now about an outer planet.
If you go towards Mercury or Venus, it's the contrary.
You will arrive with a higher velocity than the velocity of the planet.
But, anyway, what is important, is the difference between the velocity of the planet and your velocity at arrival.
It's <i>v_a âˆž</i> and, again, at this point, after you have looked at the trajectory from a heliocentric point of view,
You can go to the boundary of the sphere of influence and you have <i>v_a âˆž</i>, you will select the value we have seen that already
<i>d_âˆž</i>, the impact parameter, and <i>Î¸</i> to figure out whether you want to go on an equatorial orbit around the destination planet, or maybe a polar orbit orbit, or something in between or you want to do a direct impact on the planet, or you want to do only a flyby: you decide that as a flight controller.
So you have <i>v_a âˆž</i>, <i>d_âˆž</i> and <i>Î¸</i>, and this will determine your trajectory, hyperbolic trajectory inside the sphere of influence of the destination planet.
And you will know on the basis of these what the value of <i>v_P</i> will be, the velocity of your spacecraft at the periapsis of your hyperbolic trajectory.
That's it, you have completed your journey, and once you come to the periapsis, you can decide what you want to do.
We have seen already, if you want to come on an orbit around the destination planet, you need to do a braking maneuver, you can possibly arrive in the higher layers of the atmosphere of the destination planet, and you use that as <i>Î”V</i> that will help you reduce your velocity to come on orbit around the destination planet.
That's it, you have completed your journey.
Let's look at some data for interplanetary trajectories, and we will consider in particular the case of Venus and the case of Mars.
So Venus: it's a journey toward an inner planet.
This is the semi-major axis of the orbit of Venus, the semi-major axis of the orbit of Mars
We have seen this already before.
Now, as far as the transfer orbit characteristics: this is what we have for Venus and Mars.
Obviously the perihelion of the transfer trajectory of Venus and the aphelion is at the Earth.
And it's the contrary for Mars.
The perihelion is at the Earth, and the aphelion is at Mars.
Now, you know that the heliocentric Earth velocity is about 30 km/s, and in order to go to Venus you need to reduce somewhat that velocity that's the heliocentric 
Earth departure velocity to go to Venus.
That's why the Earth departure excess velocity, or hyperbolic excess velocity, is a negative value
And in the case of Mars you have to increase the velocity of your spacecraft versus the velocity of the Earth around the Sun in order to achieve that transfer orbit outside of the orbit of the Earth towards Mars, and you see that the Earth departure excess velocity, or hyperbolic excess velocity, is positive in the case of Mars.
