Hello and welcome to this sixth chapter of the course of fluid mechanics. The sixth chapter deals with the notion of balance. We will learn in this chapter to make balances either on macroscopic volumes, or more often on infinitesimal volumes.
We will at first introduce the notion of mass balance, the matter balance and discover the particular importance of the notion of divergence, particularly the divergence of the velocity field. We will then see the notion of balance of momentum and apply it in a viscous regime in which the effects of inertia can be neglected, in particular we will see the fundamental law of Poiseuille that governs the pressure gradient needed to make a fluid flow in a circular pipe. Then we will see the notion of lubrication which is an approximation of the momentum balance and the mass balance when the geometry of the flow allows it, i.e. when we are dealing with what we call a thin layer. Finally, we will approach the momentum balance when this time the effect of inertia are dominant regarding the viscous effects so when the Reynolds number is big. This will be for us a first overview of Bernoulli's principle that will be detailed more broadly during chapter 7. Today, the subject is the mass balance and the interpretation of the divergence operator. But before that, a little quiz to begin with that reflects very well what we will see in this chapter 6, it is for you, again here, before even having the answer elements, to try to develop the intuition and to see if you can guess in a certain way, what is the answer of this quiz.
Let's consider a fluid flowing in a pipe of circular cross-section and we are asking you to determine the shape of the velocity profile. Are we dealing with like in 1 at what we call a bottle cap profile
? Or like in 2 at a profile very rounded
? Or like suggested in 3, a profile more sharp of a parabolic type ? We will see the detailed answer to this question during the second module. Let's go back to the subject of today namely the mass balance. Let's consider firstly a volume element that we often call a control volume, i.e. a fluid element, here of a rectangular shape, between x and x + dx, y and y + dy, it is always implied by these notations dx and dy that these lengths are small. This element is infinitesimal, it is very small. We will apply a very simple principle, in the case here of a fluid i.e. a fluid of which the density is independent and constant, it is independent of space, it is independent of temperature, independent of time, it is simply constant. In this case here, the principle of conservation of matter, as there are no chemical reactions, therefore it is a principle of conservation of mass that results by constant density in a principle of conservation of volume.
This fluid element must conserve its volume.
To guaranty that it will conserve its volume, we will simply write a relation very simple that is of course valid only in stationary, the flow must be stationary, all that comes in must go out. Let's look what is going in and what is going out in the x direction.
Given the orientation of x and of y, it goes in by the left u(x,y) dy and it goes out by the right -u(x+dx, y) dy, the - means that it is a fluid going out when u is positive, so on the left with a positive u we are entering in the element, on the right with a positive u, we are leaving the element. You are going to say, how is it possible that to obtain the flow rate, as actually the product of a velocity and a length is a linear flow rate, how is it that we can simply do the product of the velocity and of the section, here linear, of the surface area, namely dy.
The reason is very simple, we are looking at infinitesimal elements and that in a certain way if I write here, the true expression would be the integral between y and y +dy of u(x,y') dy', this time x is fixed and this I will simply approximate it by (dy being very small), the product of the velocity of u(x,y)*dy. Now, what happens in the y direction?
I simply have a vertical velocity v upwards entering by the lower side of length dx that is v(x,y) dx and what goes out on top, is -v(x, y + dy) dx, if I apply the principle of everything that goes in must go out, I obtain that the sum of all these contributions, of these
4 contributions, what enters on the left, what leaves on the right, what enters the bottom and what leaves the top, must simply be equal to 0. Now I will apply a very classical method consisting on remembering that dx is very small. For example I can estimate by what we call in French a "limited development" or
Taylor expansion, I will be able to estimate u(x+ dx, y), it is a function with two variables, a field depending on x and y, but here I will do the Taylor expansion only in the x direction, according to the x variable, I will write that it is nothing else than u(x,y) at the reference point
+ the partial derivative because u depends on two variables x, y so I am partially deriving only with respect to x and this increment
I have to multiply it by dx. Of course, there are smaller terms. The subtraction of  u(x, y)dy - u(x + dx, y)dy simply gives me
-âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x(x, y) dxd y. I reason in a perfectly similar way about v and I obtain
-âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x + âˆ‚v/âˆ‚y dxdy = 0. These elements can be simplified as they are positive quantities and so I obtain the continuity relation that tells me tha  âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x
+  âˆ‚v/âˆ‚y is equal to 0. Some of you might have recognized here an operator well known called the divergence operator.
The most general expression of conservation of mass for an incompressible fluid corresponding to the conservation of volume, is that divergence of u (div(u)) is equal to 0. div(u) is often written âˆ‡.u = 0, i.e. the scalar product between âˆ‡ and u is equal to 0. The âˆ‡ operator you all know it, it is simply âˆ‚/âˆ‚x, âˆ‚/âˆ‚y and âˆ‚/âˆ‚z that I apply with a scalar product to, in classical notation, u over x, v over y and x over z, this scalar product gives me simply that div(u) = âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x
+ âˆ‚v/âˆ‚y +âˆ‚w/âˆ‚z, which must be equal to 0. You recognize the equation that I have derived previously by considering a small fluid element in the case where there is no velocity w, there is no z direction, I was in the plane of the board.
Here is the most general expression of the continuity relation or conservation of volume, or if you prefer, in an incompressible case, conservation of mass. If now, I am considering more generally a fluid of which the density can depend on space and time, therefore the conservation of mass for a stationary flow will be simply written div(Ï�u)
= 0. Even more generally, for a non-stationary flow, I would simply have the relation very natural which is âˆ‚Ï�/âˆ‚t + uâˆ‡Ï�,
I recall you that this is the partial derivative with respect to time, the convective derivative and the whole is the total derivative, will be simply equal to div(Ï�u), and that is the conservation of mass.
Let's try to give an interpretation to the notion of divergence, we are going to demonstrate that the divergence expresses the expansion of a fluid particle, so div(u) is 1/v.dv/dt.
So consider at the instant t a fluid particle of volume V and at the instant t+dt, its volume has changed, it has become V+dV and the question that you ask yourself is simply
"What is 1/V.dV/dt equal to ?", what is the relative variation of volume per time unit equal to? It is actually the divergence of the velocity field.
You see that dimensionally this is very correct, velocity are m.s^-1, when I take the divergence, I am taking a derivative with respect to space so I am dividing by m, so these are s^-1 and when I take a volume they are m^3/s for the d/dt that I divide by m^3, it thus cancels out we have s^-1. How to demonstrate this relation ? In the absence of demonstrating it in a systematic way, I will demonstrate it in two dimensions. Let's start by understanding what is happening to a linear fluid element. I consider at the instant t a fluid element AB, we will make later on the distance AB tend to 0, we will take a small distance AB, an infinitesimal distance, for the moment let's consider simply a line segment AB, in a unidirectional motion, this means simply that the line segment AB is orientated in the x direction and the flow occurs also in the x direction, so the vectors are tangential to the fluid segment. Here  I have represented it displaced but you must imagine that A is here and that, for the sake of representation,
I have done it like this. I have decided to shift it at the instant dt, but in fact they of course, given the velocity field, remained on the same line. What we see, is that, if I assume that these velocities are positive, I am specifying right now here that it is positive, then if the velocity of A is smaller than the velocity of B, the line segment AB, when it deforms for an instant dt to become A'B', then
A'B' is stretched compared to AB, so we have had a stretching. Conversely, if these velocities are always positive but if this time uxA is greater than uxB, which is not the case represented here on the screen, then the line segment AB is compressed to become
A'B', we see that we are dealing with the linear stretching, linear or with the linear compression. The question that arises, is
"What is the increment ?", so what is the variation in length of the line segment AB ? It is very easy, it is simply A'B' - AB which is very naturally written uxB dt which is the displacement of the point B - uxA dt which is the displacement of the point A. The difference between these two displacements is simply the variation of the length of the line segment AB. If now I put myself in the situation that
I have indicated earlier on i.e. that the distance AB that I note dx tends towards
0, then I can do like earlier on a Taylor expansion and I find very naturally that uxB is equal to uxA
+ âˆ‚ux/âˆ‚x dx +... hence the relation above.
We see here âˆ‚ux / âˆ‚x is in fact the stretching coefficient of the line segment
AB. Now, let's consider that two-dimensional case, this time I will deform a quadrilateral
ABCD into a quadrilateral A'B'C'D', for example, if we look how evolves the line segment
AB, this time the velocity is not unidirectional, we have a velocity in the x direction and a velocity in the y direction, we see that the velocity in the x direction of the point B is greater than the one of point A and they are both positive, so the segment AB is stretching in the x direction and on the other hand the point B having a vertical velocity lower than point A, the point B' is moving of a lesser quantity in the y direction and finds itself a little lower in the y direction than the point A'. Similarly, C' finds itself slightly to the left of point
A' simply because its velocity in the x direction uxC is smaller to the one of point A. In the same way, the line segment
AC transforms in a line segment A'C' that has been compressed this time in the y direction.
Now, I would like to evaluate the area
A'B'C'D' and compare it to the area ABCD. Evaluating a quadrilateral area that has no more parallel sides, is not particularly easy so what I will do is first of all neglect the areas that I will hatch here. Why can I do this? I can do it for a reason very simple, that is I am considering a motion over a time dt which is very short and as this time dt is very short the angles are necessarily very small. The approximation is small, the one of neglecting the hatched zone.
If I neglect this hatched zone, the point
A'' I position it in A', I will simply write the area of the quadrilateral A'B'C'D' is just about the one of A"B"C"D", now it is extremely easy to measure the area of a rectangle, I will simply use
2 times the argument that I have done previously about stretching, so I will state that the area of the quadrilateral A"B"C"D" is just about the area, I can write it if you want, it is simply (AB + âˆ‚ux / âˆ‚x dt)(AC+âˆ‚uv/âˆ‚y),
I am sometimes using the notation ux in the direction x and uy in the direction y and sometimes ux is simply equal to u or uy is simply equal to v. You should slowly get used to changes of notation, anyway here is this area, and, when I expand this product, I find that it is of course (AB)(AC)+ (AC)(AB). âˆ‚v/âˆ‚y dt + (AB)(AC).âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x dt. I have remaining terms that are products between small quantities as there will be âˆ‚u/âˆ‚x, âˆ‚v/âˆ‚y and especially, more important, âˆ‚t^2. As dt is small, it is negligible. I then find dominant, once I have subtracted the starting area (AB)(AC),  I find this expression here, and I recognize the operator of divergence. Finally, the increment of volume, so here an area increment, we will call it Î´A which is this quantity here divided by A, which is this quandtity here, it is simply equal to div(u) dt. In 3D, we generalize it to Î´ Î©/Î© = div(u) dt.
In other words div(u) = 1/Î© or 1/V dV dt.
