We have reached the end of this MOOC on ecological monitoring.
I hope you that have enjoyed participating in it as much as we have enjoyed preparing the course.
And of course I do hope it helped you better understand how important ecological monitoring is for the health of protected areas and for the entire decision making process.
I would like to thank a couple of people.
First, all the speakers involved in this MOOC.
BÃ©atrice Chataigner, (INAUDIBLE)
Inza Kone, (INAUDIBLE)
Thanks to you all.
Then, thanks to (INAUDIBLE) who manages the MOOC daily, and Madeline (INAUDIBLE), who translated it into English and prepared the book that comes with it.
I also want to thank the staff from EPFL, especially Tibo (INAUDIBLE) who edited all the videos.
Thank you to all of those involved in the EPFL Center for digital education.
And of course, our friends from the MOOCs for Africa Unit, who allowed for this program to even exist.
Please let us know what you thought.
Any suggestions to improve this MOOC are welcome.
We need your input to keep moving forward.
And of course, you can follow us via our other MOOCs but also on papaco.org, on Facebook.
