Now a quick summary of chapter 10.
One dimension boundary value problems with the finite difference method.
I considered the problem of the elastic rope
- u''(x) = f(x), where f is given force, and u is the displacement of the rope, this for x in the interval [0,1].
The boundary conditions are u (0) = 0 and u(1) = 0.
The rope is clamped at both ends. 
I presented a finite difference scheme, which was obtained using a centered finite difference formula of the second derivative.
The scheme can be written:
(-u_i-1 +2u_i - u_i+1) / h^2 = f(x_i), for all points x_i uniformly distributed on the rope. 
Here h is the step size which separates two consecutive points.
I write the scheme as a linear system,
A u = f, with A the tridiagonal matrix with 2 on the diagonal and -1 above and below the diagonal, with a coefficient 1/h^2 in front of this tridiagonal matrix.
We have proven that the error is O(h^2), the maximum of the error between u(x_i), which is the unknown exact solution, and its approximation u_i which can be calculated by computer, this error is in O(h^2), this means that it is divided by 4 each time h is divided by 2, assuming that the solution u is four times continuously differentiable.
I then applied the same method to a nonlinear problem a nonlinear toy problem:
-u''(x) +x u(x)^3 = f(x).
<i>u(x)</i> au cube ici, donc <i>xu(x)</i> au cube, et j'ai appliquÃ© la mÃªme mÃ©thode.
Instead of obtaining a linear system A u = f,
I have a nonlinear system:
F(u) = 0 with F and u both vectors.
We used Newton's method to approximate the solution to this problem, and this method was written as: u_n known, I will calculate u_n+1, which is such that
Df(u_n) multiplied by u_n minus u_n+1 equal to F(u_n).
I did not say it, but thus method is also
O(h^2).
I suggest to perform numerical experiments during the exercice session.
