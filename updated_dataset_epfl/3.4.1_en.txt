We'll be looking at the catch up rate here.
This is a set of expressions that will be very useful when we handle rendezvous later in the course.
Let's consider the following.
We have the Earth in the middle; we have two spacecraft that are on the same local vertical at a given time, separated by <i>Î”r</i>, with <i>Î”r</i> much smaller than <i>r</i>,
<i>r</i> being the radius of the upper orbit.
Now, this is the initial condition, and the final condition, after one full orbit, will be the following.
Obviously, the lower object, or the lower spacecraft or satellite, has a smaller period.
This is the third Kepler's Law, because the <i>a</i> is smaller, respective the <i>r</i> smaller.
So this is the initial condition, and we have the final condition after one full orbit, that is represented here.
Now, although they were on the same local vertical initially, after one full orbit, obviously, the lower object will move forward versus the upper object by a distance <i>Î”X</i> expressed in meters.
And we'll determine what is the value of <i>Î”X</i> versus <i>Î”r</i> for very nearby orbits.
Let's start with the expression of the period:
<i>T = 2Ï€ âˆš (a^3/Î¼)</i>, this is the third Kepler's Law.
So it's equal to 
<i>2Ï€ ( 1/ âˆš Î¼ ) r^(3/2).</i>
Let's take the derivative now.
<i>dT/dr= 3Ï€ (1/ âˆš Î¼ ) r^(1/2)</i>, which is <i>3Ï€ âˆš (r/Î¼)</i>, but <i>r/Î¼</i> is the reciprocal of the circular velocity, so, <i>3Ï€ (1/V_circ)</i>.
Now, that's interesting, because we can put <i>V_circ</i> on the other side, and instead of the <i>dT/dr</i>, we take <i>Î”T</i> for small values of <i>T</i> and small values of <i>r</i>, and we can derive in this way that <i>V_circâˆ™Î”T = Î”X</i>, and is about equal to <i>3Ï€ Î”r</i>.
So this is the interesting thing, that the <i>Î”X</i> after one full orbit is going to be equal to <i>3Ï€ Î”r</i>, the difference in altitude of the two satellites.
So, 3Ï€ is about 10.
So, typically, if the two objects are on the same local vertical at some point, after one full orbit, the lower object will have moved forward by a distance equal to ten times the difference in attitude.
Typically, if the Shuttle was initially below the International Space Station let's say 100 meters at some point, after one full orbit it will have drifted one kilometer forward.
If it was <i>above</i> the International
Space Station initially, the same on the two local vertical at some point, after one full orbit, the Shuttle will have drifted one kilometer behind.
Now, let's take a similar example, where the inner orbit is not circular, as it is here on this drawing, but slightly elliptical.
Knowing that the period of revolution is entirely dependent on the semi-major axis <i>a</i>, and not on the eccentricity, we can derive a similar expression for <i>Î”X</i>.
So, let's take the outer orbit circular, radius <i>r</i>, and the inner orbit elliptical, with a semi-major axis of <i>a</i>, with |<i>r-a</i>| much smaller than <i>r</i>.
Now we can derive the same expression, which is the <i>Î”X</i> after one full orbit, is going to be equal, approximately, to <i>3Ï€ (r-a)</i>.
With a <i>Î”X</i> positive, if the object is below, let's say the Shuttle is below the International Space Station then, the Shuttle will be <i>leading</i> after one orbit.
And the <i>Î”X</i> negative, if the second object the Shuttle versus the International
Space Station, for instance, is above.
In this case, the Shuttle will be, after one orbit, <i>trailing</i> by a distance which is roughly equal to ten times the difference in attitude respective, the distance between the radius of the circular orbit, and the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit.
As a summary, for circular orbits, the drift forward or aft for that matter of an object pretty close to another object, on a circular orbit, will be equal to <i>3Ï€ Î”r</i>, or roughly ten times the difference in altitude.
Now, if we have a circular orbit and another orbit which is pretty close, but which is elliptical with a semi-major axis of <i>a</i>, then this expression becomes <i>Î”X approximately equal to 3Ï€ (r-a)</i>.
Always with a condition that the difference between the two, <i>r</i> and <i>a</i>, is much smaller than <i>r</i>.
