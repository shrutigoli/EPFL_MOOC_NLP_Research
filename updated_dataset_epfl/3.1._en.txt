Welcome to Week 3 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
This week, we will discuss fundamental features regarding the generation of synchrotron light and relevant aspects of machine physics.
To begin with, the forces acting on a charged particle through an electric or magnetic field are summarised. Following this, I will explain why it is that charged particles, in our case electrons, generate electromagnetic radiation when they are accelerated. This leads us on to the surprising features of light emission from electrons moving at relativistic velocities, such as found in synchrotron storage rings, in particular the greatly enhanced emission in the forward direction to produce a pencil-like beam.
Storage rings are just that - closed rings that maintain electrons on a closed path.
How the electrons are steered and manipulated so that they remain on this path will take up the remainder of this first video of the week, including descriptions of the magnet lattice and the energy source for the electrons within the storage ring, namely the RF cavity.
More advanced aspects are discussed next week, including an overview of the two newest kids on the block, x-ray free-electron lasers, and diffraction-limited storage rings.
By convention, a linearly polarized electromagnetic plane wave propagating in the positive z-direction will, for an observer looking in the forward z-direction, have its magnetic-field vector always rotated +pi/2 (90 degrees) clockwise relative to the electric-field vector. So, for example, if the magnetic field points in the positive y-direction, the E-field will point in the positive x-direction.
In which directions do the electric- and magnetic-field components of the electromagnetic radiation act upon an electron? The force imparted by an electric field on an electron (with its negative charge) always acts perpendicular to the direction of propagation and (because of the electronâ€™s negative charge) in the opposite direction of the electric-field vector, that is F_E = -little e the elementary charge, times big E, the electric field amplitude.
We now discuss the magnetic Lorentz force acting on a moving electron with velocity v. First, you should note that the conventional current is opposite in direction to the electron motion, and that the positive direction of the magnetic field B is defined as being from the north to south pole. Hence, bending magnets in synchrotron facilities in which the electrons circulate in a clockwise sense (viewed from above) will have the north poles above the south poles, and vice-versa for â€œanticlockwiseâ€� storage rings.
The direction of the magnetic Lorentz force
F_L acts perpendicularly to the plane defined by the electronâ€™s direction of motion and the magnetic-field vector B. It is proportional to the cross-product of v and B. If, as in the case shown here, the electrons copropagate in the same positive z-direction as the EM-field, then the Lorentz force will have its maximum magnitude F_L = eBv and in a direction opposite to that of the electric force.
From classical electromagnetism, it emerges that the relationship between the magnetic-field amplitude B and the electric-field amplitude E of an EM-wave is B = E/c and hence from this and the expressions for the electric and magnetic forces we immediately observe that the ratio of the two forces is simply -v/c. As a consequence, the Lorentz force only becomes non-negligible compared to the electric-field force for electrons travelling at relativistic velocities.
We now move on by asking the question â€œwhy does a synchrotron, which is in essence simply a collection of electrons moving at very high velocities around a closed path, produce electromagnetic radiation?â€� First of all, it should be mentioned that typically, the kinetic energies of the electrons within a storage ring of a synchrotron all have the same value within approximately
0.1% of each other, which might seem to imply that they are not being accelerated. Donâ€™t forget, however, that acceleration also includes a change in direction, even if the magnitude of the velocity remains constant, such as in the case of a ball being whirled round on the end of a string. The centripetal force always acts at right angles to the ballâ€™s motion, as does the associated acceleration.
So when we ask why a charged particle produces light when accelerated, we should consider three cases - the conventional interpretation of acceleration, i.e., an increase in speed; the opposite, that is, DEceleration; and lastly, centripetal acceleration. This third case applies to synchrotron light.
OK. we still havenâ€™t answered our question.
Let us begin with a stationary charged particle.
From hereon in, I will assume for simplicity that the charged particle is an electron.
The electrostatic electric field lines radiate out from the electron equally in straight lines in all directions and at the speed of light. Any observer looking at the electron will see no transverse component of those electric field lines because, as Iâ€™ve just said, they point directly from the electron to the observerâ€™s eye. But electromagnetic radiation is a transverse wave, that is, the electric (and magnetic) field lines are perpendicular to the direction of motion. So we can conclude that an observer will never see light emitted from a stationary electron. For simple reasons which I will not dwell on here, the same is true of an electron moving at a constant velocity.
Now let us consider the case where the electron bounces off a wall and reverses its direction.
Clearly here, it has undergone an acceleration
(or in day-to-day parlance, a sudden deceleration and acceleration). An observer will see no electric field until a time after the electronâ€™s bounce, equal to the distance between the observer and electron, divided by the speed of light. But at this moment, there will be an abrupt lateral shift in the electric-field lines - the observer sees a lateral component in the electric fields, which is synonymous with the generation of light. Note also, that although an observer at position B sees this pulse of light clearly, an observer at A will continue to see nothing, because the acceleration was along her line of sight. This is an important fact to keep in mind - light generated by acceleration of charged particles has zero intensity in the direction of that acceleration.
Let us extend this idea further by allowing the electron to bounce repeatedly back and forth between two walls. The resultant field lines will include abrupt lateral components
(light) that appear regularly after each bounce.
Now, if instead of the electron moving with constant speed between two walls, we instead drive it sinusoidally, the resulting electric field will have the same frequency and thus mimic the driving acceleration. So if the driving acceleration of the electron is itself caused by the electric field component of light, the electron will re-emit light at exactly the same frequency. This is identical to the elastic, or Thomson, scattering of light by electrons we covered in last weekâ€™s lectures. It is for this reason that metals reflect visible light and therefore why mirrors work - the essentially free conduction electrons in the metal that allow it to conduct electricity respond to incident light and re-emit it with high fidelity.
Note once more that along the axis of acceleration, the observer will see no light. The electric-field amplitude follows the cosine of chi, the polar angle between incident beamâ€™s direction of propagation and the axis of the observer, as shown here. This is referred to a dipole radiation. The light INTENSITY varies as the square of this, that is cosine-squared chi.
So, how would the emitted radiation from an electron executing a circular path look like?
The acceleration is towards the centre of the circle, hence the symmetry axis of the doughnut, or â€œhorn torusâ€� form of the dipole radiation also lies in this direction.
This doesnâ€™t seem to look much like the pencil-like radiation distribution associated with synchrotron light, so whatâ€™s missing?
Whatâ€™s missing is relativity. Before we get to this, we need to know what the typical energies are of the electrons circulating in the storage ring of synchrotrons.
In this graph, a selection of synchrotron facilities has been chosen that cover the typical range of electron energies, expressed in GeV (billions of electron volts). As one can see, these span about 2 to 8 GeV, and provide photon energies over almost 5 orders of magnitude, from ultraviolet photons at
10 eV to almost 1 MeV. On average, the higher the storage-ring energy, the higher the range of photon energies.
If we were to calculate the electron velocities using Newtonian mechanics (that is, not taking relativistic effects into account), we would equate the electron energy to 1/2 mv-squared, where m = 9.11 x 10^-31 kg is the rest mass of an electron, and would, say for 3 GeV electron, obtain velocities of approximately 3.2 x 10^10 m/s, over 100 times faster than the speed of light.
But because we know the speed of light is
Natureâ€™s ultimate speed limit, itâ€™s clear we need to apply relativity. The relationship between the electronsâ€™ relativistic kinetic energy (given by the storage-ring energy) and the velocity is given by the expression shown here. The ratio between the electronsâ€™ velocity and c, the speed of light is called beta.
An important parameter, which we will use repeatedly to determine several aspects of synchrotron light, including its divergence, its intensity in the forward direction, and the relativistic mass of the electron, is gamma, defined as the ratio between the electronsâ€™ kinetic energy and mc^2, the rest mass energy of the electron
(highlighted here in red).
In special relativity, this is the amount of energy (other than the energy residing in mass itself) that would be created if an electron at rest was annihilated. If one plugs in the known values for m and c into this, one obtains a value for mc^2 of 82 fJ, or
511 keV. So, for example, if an electron and positron meet, they annihilate one another, and create two x-ray photons, each of energy
511 keV.
Because mc^2 is a constant for a given particle type (here, an electron), we can reformulate our expression for gamma in practical terms as gamma = 1957 multiplied by the storage ring energy expressed in GeV. So, for example, a 2-GeV storage ring facility would have a gamma of 3914, that is, each electron has an energy almost 4000 times its own rest-mass energy. Remember our original expression however, relating the electron energy to its velocity
(or beta = v/c).
From this, we immediately see that gamma = 1/sqrt(1
- beta^2).
If we square both sides of this, and perform two trivial algebraic steps, we can instead express beta, the ratio of v to c, as a function of gamma, as shown here.
We can simplify this still further as follows.
We know that in general, gamma is a large number for synchrotrons. For essentially all synchrotrons, it assumes a value somewhere between approximately 2000 and 16000. gamma^2 is therefore exceedingly large, of the order of several million to a few hundreds of million, and so the reciprocal of this, 1/gamma^2, is tiny.
In the supplementary document listing useful mathematical equations and approximations, the Taylor expansion for (1+x)^n is provided, and, to a very high degree of accuracy, is equal to 1 + nx. In this instance, x = 1/gamma^2, and therefore we can approximate the top equation here being approximately equal to beta equals
1 - 1/2 gamma^2. The inaccuracy to this approximation is about than one part in 10^15. . . accurate enough, Iâ€™d say!
So letâ€™s now consider what numbers emerge for the real example of the MAX-IV facility in Lund, Sweden, which has just come online this Summer. From our practical expression for gamma, we immediately see that this assumes a value of approximately 5900. From this, we obtain a value for beta, the ratio of electron velocity to the speed of light, of 1 - 1/6.89 x 10^7, in other words, exceedingly close to one. In fact, from this, one can directly determine that the difference in velocity of a photon and a MAX-IV electron is only a little over 4 m/s.
To obtain a feel for this, imagine a photon and electron in a straight out sprint race.
A little more than a second after the gun, they have gone past the moon, and the photon is still only about 5 meters in front of the electron. Usain Bolt often beats his opponents by this margin after less than 100 metres!
So, what other consequences are there related to the weirdness of relativity? First, in the frame of reference of a stationary observer, the electron has assumed a mass of gamma m, that is, several thousand times that at rest.
In the case of MAX-IV, this is almost equal to the mass of a tritium atom. This might still not seem much, but if I were to travel so fast, you would see me as having approximately the same mass as three blue whales combined.
Also, importantly, space becomes distorted
- it wraps forward; things that lie in front of you become brighter and bluer, while those behind dim and are red-shifted. A mathematical derivation of this special-relativistic effect caused by time-dilation and space contraction lies well outside the remit of this lecture course, so I ask you to accept this as an admittedly very weird, but certainly true, fact.
This is shown schematically here for a spaceship travelling at small and at relativistic velocities.
A homogeneous distribution of stars at low speed looks very different when travelling relativistically.
Now, remember from earlier in this video the dipole distribution sketched for an electron moving in a circular orbit, and our concern that this doesnâ€™t look much like the pencil-beam radiation of synchrotrons? Now we should understand why fast electrons distort this.
For the purposes of this course, you need not know the exact mathematical description of the spatial distribution of dipole radiation at relativistic velocities. Instead, it is shown here graphically for velocities between
1% and 99% of the speed of light. Remember that at synchrotrons, the electrons travel only approximately one part in 10^7 less than the speed of light, hence the forward radiation distribution is much narrower still than that shown here for the electron at 99% of c.
Theory tells us that the angular power density in the forward direction scales with the sixth power of gamma. Hence, all other parameters being equal (in particular a = c^2/rho, the centripetal acceleration), a doubling in gamma will produce a 64-fold increase in power density on axis.
The angular range of radiation scales as 1/gamma.
Even for medium-energy storage rings, the opening angle 1/gamma in both the horizontal and vertical planes is of the order of 1/5000 of a radian, or approximately 1/100th of a degree. This means that, for a point source, the beam will have a lateral extent of approximately
4 mm at a distance of 20 m - synchrotron radiation is indeed very collimated!
We will see later that in reality, the divergence of different sources at synchrotrons (in particular bending magnets and undulators) differs somewhat from 1/gamma for reasons we will discuss in detail later.
The next topics I would like to discuss in the second video are how the electrons are maintained in a closed orbit, and will show using back-of-the envelope calculations that the use of electric fields to bend electrons is impractical and that instead magnetic forces are used. When electrons emit synchrotron radiation, they lose energy. How this energy is replenished via a radio-frequency cavity is also explained.
