Hello, my name is Juan Montero
I'm a professor of administrative law in the UNED university in Madrid and also a scientific adviser in the Florence's school of Regulation.
My research is focused on the regulation and competition in the network industries, particularly telecoms and transport, and over the last couple of years
I have been working on the regulation of the sharing economy.
Particularly in transportation and accommodation.
I think there is a fundamental kind of legal regulatory challenge when we are talking about smart cities and it is that we have a clash between two regulatory traditions on the one hand we have the traditional infrastructure, networks, services provided in citizen terms of telecommunications transport, energy, etc.
These kinds of networks and services are closely linked to the territory where they are being established or provided and what we have is local authorities, maybe the regional, national always have an authority that is very closely linked to the territory, regulation these kinds of networks and services and we have a tradition of very intense regulation, in terms of licensing, sometimes exclusive rights, or special rights of very often, public service obligations, very often even direct provision of the service by the public authorities, so we have an established tradition of intervention in these kinds of again networks and services, but on the other hand we have a new layer which we could call the data layer, that comes from a very different tradition.
Most of the providers of this data services are global providers and they don't have a very close link with the territory where the service is being provided.
And even regulations have been built over the years to, not link the provision of this services to the territory, but on the contrary to provide the maximum flexibility for the provision of these data services. so when these data services were rather virtual and they were rather related to the management of information or content like like the impact they had on the music industry, on the media industry, it all remained pretty much virtual, but what we are understanding now that these data layers have and impact also in the physical world, and the smart cities it's probably one of the leading examples, where we see how this data layer have an impact on the physical world in terms of transport services accommodation services, energy, telecoms, etc.
And we are starting to see very practical cases and examples of this class of legitimacy between the regulation of this traditional network and services and the regulation of this new data layer above these traditional services.
I think that there are two very good examples of this class of legitimacies. 
The first one is transport, and usually the sharing economy, transport companies, like
"Uber" or "Bla-Bla-Car"
"Lyft", there are lots of examples, and what we see for instance is that local authorities tend to apply the traditional transport regulations to these new companies, which tend to be again, very restrictive in terms of licensing etc. 
But then we have these new layer services, because these companies
I mean, they don't own cars, they are not locally established for the provision of the transport services, on the contrary they are just managing the data layer above these traditional transport services.
And what they claim is that they are not subject to local transport regulations, but rather to the regulation on digital services, typically for instance, we have in Europe information, and e-commerce directive that defines the category of information, society's services, and very important to them it's not only that this directive provides regulations that even prohibits the obligation to be licensed, and other restrictions that can be imposed in provision of data services, but further more they established the principal that these services will be ruled by the legislation of the country where the provider of the services established enough of the country where the services being received, so what we see is that transport services are regulated very closely by the local authorities but the data layer is regulated according to the laws of a different country, and this of course creates for a clash in the regulation of these services that is creating many of the differences in the interpretation of what the regulation should be applied for instance, to "Uber", to "Bla-Bla-Car".
Another example in the accommodation industry is the regulation of serving economy companies like "Air BnB", and they have for instance a strong conflict with the authorities of the city of
New York, which again want to apply the local regulations accommodation, also to
"Air BnB" to the data layer.
And the automatic response of
"Air BnB" is that they are not subject to the local accommodation regulations, but rather to the data layer regulations, and in particular they claim that they should be subject to the decency communications act which exempts of liability to the providers of just this data layer services.
So, I think these are two examples, good examples of this clash of legitimacy between the local traditional accommodation transportation, telecoms, energy regulations and the regulation of this new data layer above all those services.
It is not simple form a legal regulatory and institutional point of view to provide clear cut solutions, I think, solutions have to be designed for a specific industry, for a specific service but I think there are some principals that can be defined.
The points to be taken into consideration for regulation of this new data services.
I think the solution is not just to impose the old regulatory framework, which tends to be very restrictive and that's not taking into consideration these new services but on the contrary, I don't think it's just a matter of ignoring this local regulation and pretend it doesn't exist, I think it's necessary to provide, to adopt a new regulation that first of all takes into consideration the existence of data layer services only if we acknowledge that these new services exist, we can provide a good regulation for them.
The second one is that regulation has to provide a level playing field between the traditional providers of transport, energy, telecom services and the new providers of both of data services and also of newcomers to the market that are enabled to have access to the market, thanks to this data layer, I mean all these drivers who work under the "Uber" scheme, or all those people who are working with "Air BnB", I mean they have the right to participate in the market, but we have to make sure that all the players are competing on the level playing field.
A third principal would be that traditional players should be allowed to adapt to the new scenario, we should not have regulations that keep very strict obligations on the providers of the services, that way the restrictions do not allow these traditional players to compete on equal footing with the newcomers.
And very importantly also, it is very important that the overall regulatory regime maintains a good equilibrium between all the interest in the eco-system.
We have now very different players in different layers, and we have to make sure that the whole system is sustainable in the sense for instance, that all the investment that is necessary to deploy and maintain the infrastructure in terms of transport, in terms of energy, in terms of telecoms all that infrastructure can operate in a sustainable environment where financing for such an infrastructure is ensured.
So we have to make sure that we obstruct opportunistic market entries that just extract value from the whole eco-system and do not make it possible to keep the investment in the infrastructure layer.
And finally, I think it's important to take into account that all these new technology that the new data layer gives a lot of power to the user, to the citizen and I think this is a very positive element and we should make sure that the new regulation not only make sure that their citizen is empowered, but that this power is increased, and I think this is a central element, a new element that has to ensuring first by any kind of regulation of this kind of activities.
Thank you.
