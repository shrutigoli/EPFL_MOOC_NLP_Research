Today in this video, we'll talk about another application of space tethers, and it's a pure dynamic application, not electrodynamic, but purely dynamic, either with a non-conducting tether, or with a conducting tether that doesn't carry any current.
In this case you don't have any Lawrence force, and it's a pure dynamic application.
But first of all, I would like to come back to the subject of gravity gradients, because we talked about that before; we said that's a reason why an elongated object on orbit around the Earth is going to be keeping an orientation such that the long axis of that object will be along the local vertical, and we said it's because there's more gravity force on the bottom of the object than on the top, so it will align that object along the local vertical.
And that was obviously correct, but there's a little more to it than the gravity gradient.
This is a drawing and some explanation that are taken out of a reference that I will mention at the end of this video.
It's called <i>Tethers in Space Handbook,</i> and I recommend, if you want to learn more about tethers, to have a look at this reference.
Now let's look on the left-hand side.
We have this large cylinder along the local vertical, or tube, inside which we have an astronaut.
And as it's going around the Earth on orbit, it's keeping always the orientation along the local vertical, as we already talked about.
Now let's imagine an element of mass, which I will call <i>M</i>, somewhere inside this cylinder.
This element of mass will be subject to two forces.
There is, on one hand, the gravity force, which is expressed here, and it's a force downwards, which is the product of the element of mass, or the mass of this element, which is <i>M Î¼ / r Â²</i>,
<i>r</i> being the distance to the center of the Earth.
That's one force.
And this is a profile of this force downwards as we go along the cylinder, along the local vertical.
Now there is another force on each element of mass.
This is the so-called <i>centrifugal force,</i> and it's a force upwards, and it's a product of the mass of this element times <i>nÂ² r</i>,
<i>n</i> is what we call the <i>mean motion</i> in <i>rad/s</i>.
So what is important in this is that the centrifugal force is linear with respect to the descent to the center of the Earth, is proportional to <i>r</i>, as opposed to the gravitational force which is proportional to <i>1 / r Â²</i>.
Now what is interesting is that these two profiles give null force, <i>F â†‘ = F â†“</i>, the centrifugal force equals the gravitational force pretty much at the center of mass of these tubes, the center of mass or center of gravity.
We'll come back to the difference between the two in the next slide.
But if we look in the upper part of the cylinder we have the centrifugal force larger than the gravitational force, so if we have an astronaut inside that cylinder, he can have his feet on the ceiling of this large chamber, cylindrical chamber, with a very small force, but definitely there will be a force taking him upwards.
He can put his feet on the ceiling.
As opposed to the situation at the bottom, where we have the gravitational force larger than centrifugal.
In this case the astronaut can have his or her feet downwards towards the center of the Earth.
Very small force, true, but a non-zero force.
Now this is gravity gradient, so you see that this force, that, by the way, is causing also tension on a vertical tether, is not due only to the difference in gravity between the bottom of the object to the top, but also to the centrifugal force.
There's a contribution of both forces.
And, by the way, gravity gradient forces, over a distance of about .5 m is of the order of 10^(-7) gee, over a distance of about 50 m of the order of 10^(-5) gee.
When over a pretty large distance, of 5 km, is about 10^(-3) gee, so we see that they are very small forces, but they are non-zero forces.
Just a short note on the difference between center of gravity and center of mass.
Let's take this example here, if we have a static case, constant gravity, a uniform field of gravity, the center of mass is going to be here, and it can be calculated very easily with the lever arm principle.
And basically the center of mass is the center of the distribution of the masses in the object, in the absence of any inertial force or gravity gradient force.
If we have this case here, which is, of course, the case which concerns us, with a tethered satellite, with the lower body and the upper body, and, on one hand, we have a non-uniform gravity field-- it's uniform in a room, obviously, or pretty much uniform in a room, but over a large distance of several tens of kilometers, not uniform.
So we have a gravity gradient.
In addition we have the centrifugal force.
In this case, the center of gravity being the center of the application of the forces on each element of this elongated object, the center of gravity will not be exactly in the same location as the center of mass.
In fact, in our case, it will be slightly lower than the center of mass.
Now that's a difference that we won't have, really, to consider.
We'll consider always in our application that the center of mass is the same location as the center of gravity, the difference is very small.
I just wanted you to be aware of the theoretical difference between these two concepts.
That's another illustration of the same.
You have two equal masses linked with a tether, or it could be a bar, for that matter, on orbit around the Earth.
And the mass 1 is equal to mass 2, and the center of mass is exactly in the middle, but the center of gravity somewhat closer to the lower mass.
You see here the forces <i>F_1</i> and <i>F_2</i> on the two end masses, and it's the difference between these two forces that will cause also a moment or a talk of these objects so it will take an orientation along the local vertical.
And again, in the rest of this section, including the quizzes, we'll consider the center of mass and of gravity are in the same location.
Here we have an important illustration that shows the various velocities, and especially it will tell us what will happen in case the tether breaks.
We have the lower body, which is the Shuttle.
We have here the center of gravity, or the center of mass, whatever, and the top body is a satellite, and this is the tether in between.
And this is exactly the condition that we talked about before, and we'll come back to that, that was illustrated in these tests of the tethered satellite, using the Space Shuttle as a base.
Now we have indicated here a line which is a line of the velocities of these objects.
All of the objects along this tether are kind of locked in velocity, and they are forced to maintain a certain velocity because of the vertical character of the tether.
Let's look first at the velocity of the center of gravity, here, <i>v_CG</i>.
The amplitude is equal to <i>v_CG circular on a free orbit</i>.
If you imagine that you started deployment of the tethered satellite from the orbiter initially, of course, the two objects are at the same location, and they have a certain velocity, which is a circular velocity at that altitude as you deploy the tether upwards, the Space Shuttle comes slightly downward versus the <i>CG</i>, but the <i>CG</i> will maintain the same velocity as it had before the beginning of the deployment.
The Space Shuttle will go down somewhat, and of course the satellite will go up.
Now we have, after the deployment is complete, typically of the order of 20 km, we have the distance of the satellite to the center of the Earth is <i>r_sat </i>, and this distance of the Shuttle to the center of the Earth is <i>r_Shuttle</i>.
And, of course, <i>r_Shuttle</i> is slower than <i>r_CG</i>, and <i>r_sat</i> is larger than <i>r_CG</i>.
Let's look at velocities now of the upper body.
We have, in blue, <i>v_sat</i> is larger than <i>v_circ sat</i>.
And we have here <i>v_Shuttle</i>, also in blue, is less than <i>v_circ Shuttle</i>.
When I say <i>v_circ</i>, the velocities that are along this red line here, and as we know, the <i>v_circ</i> is proportional to <i>1 over square root r </i>.
Circular velocity, as we know very well,
<i>v_circ</i> is equal to the square root of <i>Î¼ / r</i>.
So <i>v_circ</i>, or at least the absolute value, is proportional to <i>1 over square root r </i>.
That's the reason why we have this situation here.
The red line, as you see, is much shorter respectively, than the red vector, which is <i>v_circ sat</i>, is much less that <i>v_sat</i>.
The satellite is forced, because of the tether geometry, to go to a velocity which is quite a bit larger than the <i>v_circ sat</i>.
And, in the case of the Shuttle, the Space Shuttle here is forced, that's the blue arrow, the <i>v_Shuttle</i>, to go slower, the <i>v_circ Shuttle</i>, the red arrow, here.
So you have to consider now what will happen if we cut the tether.
If we cut the tether suddenly, the satellite will find itself moving at quite a bit higher velocity, <i>v_sat</i> than the <i>v_circ sat</i>, so it is as if suddenly you're giving to the satellite a <i>Î”v_sat</i> posigrade, that will, of course, inject it to a higher altitude.
On the contrary, with the Shuttle, the Shuttle is forced to go with <i>v_Shuttle</i>, the blue value, which is smaller than the <i>v_circ Shuttle</i>, so if you cut the tether, suddenly you're going to have this little green arrow here, retrograde,
<i>Î”v_Shuttle</i> is going to be a negative, but a smaller value than we had for the satellite, and the Shuttle will be forced, suddenly, to come down.
It's as if you were giving it suddenly a <i>Î”v_Shuttle</i> retrograde, it will come down.
Let's consider again the tether cut.
By the way, that's what happened on one of the tether missions,
STS-75 in 1996.
We deployed, plan was 20 km-- at 19.6 km the tether broke, so this is really something that happened.
Now, we have simplified this illustration.
At the center, here, we started deployment, and we go clockwise on this orbit.
And here we have completed the deployment.
Of course the deployment, in reality, took many, many orbits.
But let's suppose we are here, at full deployment, or close to full deployment, 20 km, and we cut the tether.
As I said before, in the previous slide, it's as if you were giving the satellite a posigrade <i>Î”v</i>, which will, of course, take it to a higher orbit.
This is like the first "burn," quote unquote, of a Hohmann transfer, but if we go to a higher orbit with the apogee on the other side, here, which will be quite a bit higher than the initial circular orbit,
And the Space Shuttle, on the contrary, will have a relatively small, but non-zero, retrograde <i>Î”v</i> that will take it to a lower orbit.
And you can immediately imagine the applications.
If you deploy something with the Space Shuttle, you want to take it to a higher orbit without using propellant, you deploy it on a tether, and then you cut the tether, and the satellite goes to a higher orbit which is what you want, without using propellant, and the Space Shuttle has performed at least part of the deorbit impulse, reduction of velocity, because eventually we want it to come and land with the Shuttle, we want to reduce its orbital latitude or orbital energy.
So this shows the really interesting, fantastic application of tether, from a pure dynamic point of view.
Here we talk about a non-conductive tether, it's just a physical link between the lower body and the upper body.
The space elevator is a concept that was imagined by Arthur Clarke, the very brilliant
British engineer-scientist.
He invented many other concepts in space exploration, but the space elevator is one of them.
Imagine that you are deploying a tether from the surface of the Earth, on the Equator, upwards, a tether that is longer than the distance to the geostationary orbit, which, as we know, from the surface of the Earth is about 36,000 km, and you put a counterweight at the end of this long tether, of say 40,000 or 45,000 km.
Of course technically it's not easy to do, but imagine that.
You have a counterweight attached to the center of mass of the whole system is above the geostationary orbit.
In this case, you are going to have tension on the tether, constant tension, because of the centrifugal force, which is fighting against the gravity, but here it's winning, because of this geometrical concept, with a counterweight.
And then you can have a climber, equipped with, for instance, solar arrays, so it generates electrical power from the Sun during the day, and it has electric motors, and it can climb along that tether, so you could have access to any orbits between low Earth orbits and the geostationary orbit, without using any propellant, but just using solar power, by climbing with this elevator.
That's the concept of the space elevator.
Of course, technically speaking, it's really difficult.
If you imagine that you hire a company to do that, that's going to be a difficult contract, and it's going to be hard for a company to promise that they are going to be able to do that.
It still is an idea that is very present in the minds of many people, and someday it may happen.
Access, cheap access to space, all the way to the geostationary orbit, or even possibly beyond.
As you have seen, tethers in space is a fascinating subject, and very promising.
If you want to know more about what has been done, by a number of mainly Italian scientists,
Cosmo, Lorenzini, and some Americans, also, this is a very good reference.
You'll find it on the internet, and it has a lot of pages--
On one hand the principles, dynamic and electrodynamic principles, are explained in detail, much more than I've been able to do here.
And also there are a lot of applications, potential applications, potential application of tethers in space.
So have a look, and you can bring your own ideas about applying this fantastic system.
