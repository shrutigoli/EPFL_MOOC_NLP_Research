Hello, and welcome this third unit of our MOOC on ecological monitoring.
In this unit, we will introduce different ecological monitoring techniques.
This will help us better grasp what ecological monitoring practically looks like on the field.
Inza Kone, social professor at the
FÃ©lix HouphouÃ«t-Boigny University of CÃ´te d'Ivoire. and Emmanuel Ima, social professor at the Ki-Zerbo University in Burkina le Faso will be helping us out.
Let's follow the impalas to see what the techniques mentioned in this unit will be.
First, we will examine what key ecological attributes
should be monitored and how to identify them.
Then, we will talk about the choices of method and sampling most adapted to the attributes.
After this, we will look at ways of following the ecosystems abiotic component, the ones supporting life.
We will also specifically focus on monitoring plants.
Big mammals will then be our point of interest, either by direct counting or by indirect counting.
Both are obviously very different techniques.
Next up, we will talk about the specific case of large carnivore monitoring, with some lions, for example.
Then, our friend Inza will share about his specialty, the very specific monitoring of primates.
As we zoom out a little bit, we will talk about aerial counting which can be useful in certain circumstances.
And we will finish the unit with Emmanuel by looking at animals that move around a lot and the specific tools needed to monitor them.
There you go. 
Remember, the quizzes between the sequences that will help you better understand all these techniques and have an excellent third unit.
