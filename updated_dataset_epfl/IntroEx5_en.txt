Welcome to the exercises for the fifth week of the course on plasma physics and applications.
You have seen that the sun is a huge, gravitationally confined fusion reactor.
In the first exercise of this week, we ask you to compute some quantities that illustrate how powerful the sun actually is.
In the second exercise, you will describe the process of a magnetic flux tube that rises through the surface of the sun due to magnetic buoyancy.
We then consider a situation where this flux tube collides with another flux tube of opposite magnetic field.
Your task will be to analyze the resulting reconnection process using the Sweet-Parker Model and discuss the validity of this approach.
I wish you good luck.
