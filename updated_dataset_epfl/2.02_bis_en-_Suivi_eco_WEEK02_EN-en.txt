Let's review the concepts introduced in this unit.
The population, this refers to all the elephants of a park.
For example, it could be a few (INAUDIBLE) of elephants in the W Park in Burkina, Niger and Benin.
Or lots more in Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe.
The Statistical variable is what we call the key ecological attribute or the indicator that we want to measure to assess the state of the monitored value.
The variable can be qualitative, like elephant's color for example.
And the variable can also be quantitative.
For instance, measuring the age of the elephants will help us know if the population is in good shape.
In other words, if the part of young, adults, and old elephants within the population is normal, and this would mean there is no poaching going on.
This age group parts we are talking about are the distribution of the age variable at the scale of the population.
But obviously we can't measure the age of all the elephants in Hwange National Park.
Therefore we will randomly select some elephants, and determine their ages.
This is the sample.
After having identified the ages within the sample, we can estimate the age of the entire elephant population.
And now, what the degree of confidence associated with this estimate is.
Age is a discreet variable.
Meaning it can take any value related to a certain number of years between the ages of the youngest and the oldest elephants in the park.
To simplify this, it is also possible to sort elephants per age groups.
Young, adult and old.
This way, the age variable is converted into a qualitative variable.
But can we be sure that the variable at the level of the sample is a good image of the total population?
We will see this in Unit 2.7.
