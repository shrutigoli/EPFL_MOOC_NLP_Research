Hello and welcome to this fifth MOOC module on the management of protected areas in Africa.
This week we will look at some specific aspects of the management of protected areas.
This module is structured as follows:
The first class will be about culture and how it can, not only be part of the values of a protected area but also how it can enhance conservation.
The second class will focus on the training of staff and partners of protected areas.
You can imagine that this is a vital point for us.
In the third class, we will dive into marine protected areas.
The fourth class will be about the conservation of species of fauna and flora through protected areas with a particular focus on the red list.
The fifth class will focus on an important tool for promoting and valuing protected areas: tourism.
The last focus for the week, and this has become a habit, will be about a convention, this time about CITES.
This deals with the international trade of endangered species.
And finally, we will have a brief recap of the main points covered in this module and then the homework.
Here we go!
Enjoy an excellent fifth week with us!
