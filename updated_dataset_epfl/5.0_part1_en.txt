Welcome to our MOOC on basic steps in magnetic resonance.
Today, we shall be talking about spin relaxation that is the subject of Chapter 5 of Peter Horeâ€™s book.
In order to observe NMR signals, as we shall see in more detail in Chapter 6, it is necessary to perturb the magnetization by applying radio-frequency pulses.
Relaxation is simply the return of the magnetisation to its equilibrium position along the magnetic field.
Relaxation comes in two distinct flavours.
First, there is longitudinal relaxation, also known as â€œspin-lattice relaxation.â€�
This is concerned with populations.
Second, there is transverse relaxation, sometimes called â€œspin-spin relaxation,â€� which is also known as â€œdecoherenceâ€� in the world of modern physics.
Like many other basic aspects of magnetic resonance, relaxation was first described in the 1940s and '50s.
The names of Wangsness and Bloch, of Bloembergen, Purcell and Pound, of Al Redfield, of Ionel Solomon, of Anatole Abragam and of Albert Overhauser are closely associated with these discoveries and their rationalization.
As we shall see, relaxation-- that is, the return of the magnetization to its equilibrium-- is driven by rapid fluctuations of magnetic interactions such as dipole-dipole couplings between the spins.
These fluctuations are due to motions of the molecules.
Relaxation is a bit complicated to explain, but, once understood, it is one of the most attractive aspects of magnetic resonance.
Relaxation allows one to determine structures of all sorts of molecular assemblies, ranging from very simple molecules to large proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes.
The opening picture of Chapter 5 starts with a sphere which is not representative of a nucleus or anything of the sort.
It is supposed to represent a spherical or nearly spherical molecule.
The molecule that the authors have in mind is in fact methane, which has a carbon in the center and four protons around it, one of which is drawn at the north pole of the sphere.
The idea is that as the methane is moving about, or tumbles about, the vector that goes from the carbon to the proton is reoriented and, in doing so, describes a chaotic trajectory.
It turns out that this motion, which is known as rotational diffusion, is responsible for relaxation, hence the relevance of this picture on the title page.
As you can see, Chapter 5 is subdivided.
First of all, the authors speak about â€œspin-lattice relaxation,â€� also called â€œlongitudinal relaxation,â€� because it is concerned with magnetization that is aligned along the static magnetic field, also known as â€œT1 relaxation,â€� following an abbreviation invented by Felix Bloch himself.
One of the manifestations of longitudinal relaxation is the Overhauser effect, which we shall discuss in some detail, because the Overhauser Effect enables us to determine structures of molecules in solution-- in particular, of proteins and nucleic acids.
There is another chapter about â€œspin-spin relaxation,â€� which I prefer to call â€œtransverse relaxation,â€� because it is about magnetization that is perpendicular to the magnetic field.
Felix Bloch called this â€œT2 relaxation.â€�
A short chapter on â€œquadrupolar relaxation,â€� which I recommend that you read, but there is not much to say about it in pictorial terms.
Then there are two long chapters, one that focuses on the applications of relaxation to determine molecular structure, and another chapter that focuses on dynamics, more specifically internal dynamics of molecules, studied by relaxation.
Chapter 5 of Peter Horeâ€™s book is concerned with â€œspin-lattice relaxation.â€�
I prefer to call it â€œlongitudinal relaxation,â€� which is the current expression in our laboratory, or simply â€œT1 relaxation,â€� which is the most common way to describe it-- also in medicine, because this quantity is relevant for magnetic resonance imaging, and therefore known to all radiologists around the world.
Spin-lattice relaxation is concerned with populations.
Before we speak of populations we have to remember that if we have an isolated spin 1/2-- an isolated proton, for example-- then we have an energy, which is different for the excited beta state than for the alpha state, which is the ground state.
For that reason, there are more spins in the ground state, that point parallel to the magnetic field, than there are spins in the excited state.
Therefore, we should distinguish the population of the alpha state and the population of the beta state.
We can define a quantity, Î”n, which is simply the difference of the population in the alpha state minus the population in the beta state.
You can see that in Boltzmann equilibrium, n(Î±) is larger than n(Î²) and consequently Î”n should be positive.
Indeed, when it is in equilibrium, this quantity is called Î”n equilibrium.
In some magnetic resonance experiments, we shall perturb the system so that the populations are equalized at the beginning of the experiment.
Then, the spins will tend to fall back from the excited state into the ground state, and in doing so, the quantity Î”n, that is, the difference between the populations, will gradually recover following an exponential law so that Î”n will ultimately converge asymptotically to its value at equilibrium.
It turns out that this law, expressed by this equation, gives the difference of populations as a function of time.
The equilibrium difference, is determined by Boltzmann's Law, which depends on the field-- i.e., on the spacing between the energy levels-- and depends on the gyromagnetic ratio, and also depends on the temperature.
This equation describes the curve that you see.
For t = 0 we have 1 - 1 = 0, and for t = âˆž the factor e^-âˆž = 0 so we have the equilibrium.
It turns out that this law is the solution of a differential equation which says that the time derivative of the difference in populations is proportional to the deviation of the difference from its equilibrium position, and that the rate that determines the speed is 1/T1.
It turns out that 1/T1, which has units of inverse seconds, is also known as R1, known as â€œlongitudinal relaxation rate,â€� also expressed in inverse seconds.
Please do not confuse this with Hertz (Hz).
Although they have similarities, one should keep rates separate from frequencies in a spectrum.
These expressions can be recast in a simpler form, if we express the longitudinal component of the magnetization vector, which is proportional to Î”n-- that is to say, to the difference between the populations of the alpha and the beta states.
It is convenient to define another quantity,
Î”Mz, not to be confused with this quantity, which is defined as Mz at time t minus Mz at equilibrium.
The quantity Î”Mz also evolves with time, of course, and we can say that Î”Mz as a function of time is equal to its initial value Î”Mz(t = 0) multiplied by exp(-t/T1).
These equations are related but it's perhaps easier to see that we have to look at the difference between the asymptotic value and the instantaneous value.
It is this quantity that decreases exponentially.
It turns out that the time constant T1, which is the characteristic time of the exponential recovery, varies a great deal from case to case.
For example, T1 can be on the order of a microsecond for quadupolar nuclei-- which have very fast relaxation, therefore also very broad lines-- such as, for example, chlorine or bromine.
T1 might be on the order of 100 milliseconds for protons in large biomolecules
T1 might be on the order of a second for carbon-13 or nitrogen-15 in large molecules.
In some cases-- in solids in particular-- T1 might be on the order of days or even weeks.
One example is lithium fluoride, which, unfortunately, Professor Gorter at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands chose for his very first attempt to observe NMR in solids in 1944.
He chose a crystal of lithium fluoride where the T1 of the fluorine-19 is on the order of days or weeks.
For that reason, once he saturated the populations, they never recovered, and therefore he couldn't see any signal at all.
Nevertheless, quite remarkably, he wrote a paper about the <i>failure</i> of an attempt to observe magnetic resonance in bulk.
The paper was published in <i>Physica</i>.
It is indeed a very remarkable paper and therefore worth publishing.
Not many people can claim that.
Relaxation is driven by motions, more specifically by the rotation of molecules in liquids.
Rotational motion is also known as rotational diffusion, as opposed to translational diffusion.
This can be illustrated by the case of methane dissolved in some liquid.
The methane molecule can have a carbon-13 at its center, and one of the four protons could initially, at t = 0, be aligned with the north pole of this diagram.
That would be at time t = 0.
We can revisit the same molecule a few nanoseconds later.
Ï„c is the â€œcorrelation timeâ€� of the diffusional rotation.
If we wait (1/4)Ï„c, there is a likelihood that the C-H vector has changed its position to reorient itself, and now points somewhere else.
Most of the vectors still point somewhere in the vicinity of the North pole, but some of them have already made large excursions towards the equator.
If we wait four times longer-- that is to say, a full correlation time Ï„c-- then we see that the dots are almost all over the place.
Although they're still clustered near the North pole.
Many of the molecules have undergone a tumbling motion of sizeable amplitude.
If we wait four times longer, then we actually end up with an almost isotropic distribution of orientations-- that is to say the C-H vector has forgotten where it came from, except for a few that are still clustered near the North pole.
Rotational diffusion is best described by considering the scalar product between the vector at time t and the same vector at time tâ€™ = t + Ï„.
We normalize by dividing by the square of the amplitude of the vector, which we assume to have a constant length, as indeed seems quite reasonable for a vector between a carbon and an attached proton.
This is nothing but the cosine of the angle-- which depends on the time Ï„-- of the angle between the z axis-- the direction of the North pole-- and the instantaneous position of the vector at time Ï„.
We can take an ensemble average of this quantity, 
<cosÎ¸(Ï„)>, i.e., an average over all possible realizations.
We average over many cosine waves.
There might be a very fast cosine wave for a molecule that tumbles very rapidly-- there might be a cosine wave that's somewhat slower, and there might be one that hardly evolves at all.
If you add them up, or if you take their average, you will find that overall, the resultant of these interfering beats, is actually a mono-exponential function which can be written exp(-Ï„/Ï„c).
This is not t but Ï„.
This function can be given a name.
We shall write C(Ï„), which is usually called â€œcorrelation function.â€�
The correlation function that was illustrated here, starting with a simple scalar product, refers to vectors, or, if you prefer, to first-rank interactions.
In NMR, we are not really interested in vectors.
Dipole-dipole interactions, transform like second-rank interactions.
First-rank interactions, like these vectors, can be represented by p orbitals, whereas second-rank interactions can be represented by d orbitals.
Whatever the details of the mathematics, one can also define correlation functions for second-rank interactions.
We define a correlation function which has a mono-exponential decay.
This is associated with the name of Markov,
We cannot measure the correlation function directly, but we can transform it into a spectral density function.
The transformation of a function that depends on time into a function that depends on frequency can be achieved by an operation called Fourier transformation.
We shall encounter this Fourier transformation in some detail in Chapter 6.
In Chapter 6, it is used for the analysis of the signal so that we obtain a spectrum.
Here, it is used to transform the correlation function into a spectral density function.
If the correlation function of the second-rank interaction has this particular form, where Ï„(c) is the correlation time of the rotational diffusion, then the Fourier transform will give us a spectral density function which has a Lorentzian shape.
The Lorentzian function is given explicitly here, we have Ï„(c) in the numerator, and, importantly,
Ï‰Â² times Ï„(c)Â² in the denominator.
We can draw such a function, and it looks like this if we do not use a logarithmic scale but a normal scale.
If we have Ï‰ starting at 0, then it turns out that the Lorentzian will look something like this.
It turns out that the area under the curve, which we can, of course, express as the integral from zero to infinity, is nothing else but 1, which is actually the initial value of the correlation function at time zero.
This suggests a probabilistic interpretation of the spectral density function.
If we consider a certain interval, the partial area corresponds to the probability that the motional diffusion will occur at frequencies between the lower limit and the upper limit, let me call them i and j.
It turns out that to represent
J(Ï‰) as a function of Ï‰, it may be convenient to replace the Ï‰ scale by a logarithmic scale where we have the log of the ratio of Ï‰ divided by some reference Ï‰(0).
We can distinguish different regimes. 
When Ï„(c) is long, that is to say, four times longer than 1/Ï‰(0), the spectral density starts at a high value and drops rather quickly.
We can have a correlation time that is the inverse of Ï‰(0), in which case we have a sigmoid function like this.
For a much shorter correlation time, we have a long plateau, and only a drop of the spectral density towards higher frequencies.
Spin-lattice relaxation is driven by motion, more specifically by rotational diffusion of the molecules that we are looking at.
Rotational diffusion can be expressed in terms of the correlation time Ï„(c).
On this graph, the correlation time runs from about a picosecond,
10^-12 secondsâ€” that is appropriate for very small molecules such as water-- to 10^-8 seconds, which is ten nanoseconds-- that is appropriate for a protein of a molecular mass of about 10,000 amu (atomic mass units) or 10 kilodalton, as molecular biologists like to say.
As a function of the correlation time, the longitudinal relaxation time T1, initially drops, reaches a minimum, and goes back up again.
This minimum is in the vicinity of a correlation time close to the inverse of Ï‰(0), where Ï‰(0) is the Larmor frequency.
So, Ï‰(0) is 2Ï€ times the gyromagnetic ratio times the amplitude of the applied magnetic field.
So, typically, if the applied magnetic field is 9.4 T (tesla), and if we are looking at protons, then this will be about 400 MHz (megahertz).
We're talking about frequencies-- expressed in Hz (hertz) or MHz (megahertz), but Ï‰(0)must be expressed in radians per second.
The ballpark is 400 MHz.
These are the frequencies of molecular motions to which NMR is sensitive, depending on the field that we apply.
As a general rule, the relaxation rate R1, which is the inverse of T1, is proportional to the spectral density J(Ï‰) taken at the particular value Ï‰ = Ï‰(0).
The spectral density is a function J(Ï‰), and somewhere on the Ï‰ scale, we have the Larmor frequency Ï‰(0) for the nucleus in the field that we have chosen, and at that frequency Ï‰(0) the spectral density
J(Ï‰) has a certain value.
We can move the frequency Ï‰(0), for example, by going to a higher field, or to a lower field, or by switching, for example, from protons to carbon-13, or to nitrogen-15, etc.
But, basically, for a given nucleus in a given field, the frequency Ï‰(0) is fixed, and we only measure J(Ï‰(0)).
It turns out that the rate R1 is also proportional to the square of the amplitude of the local fluctuations of the magnetic field.
In the particular case of extreme narrowing-- that is to say, if Ï„(c) is smaller than 1/Ï‰(0)â€” we are on the left side of this curve.
We can have a more explicit form for a case where relaxation is driven by the dipole-dipole interaction.
The symbols A and X refer to a pair of spins, one spin A and one spin X.
There is a distance between them, which we simply call r, and there is a dipole-dipole interaction.
This is the magnitude of the dipole-dipole coupling.
It turns out that in the extreme narrowing regime where Ï„(c) is short, the relaxation rate R1 = 1/T1, is simply proportional to the square of the dipole-dipole coupling and also proportional to the correlation time Ï„(c) of rotational diffusion.
We can replace this term by the square of the gyromagnetic ratio of nucleus A, times the square of the gyromagnetic ratio of the other nucleus X.
So, if the two nuclei have the same gyromagnetic ratio, then it's simply Î³^4.
The rate R1 is proportional to the inverse of the sixth power of the distance between A and X.
It is also proportional to Ï„(c), but only in the regime where the correlation times are shorter than the inverse of the Larmor frequency Ï‰(0).
This concludes part one of this chapter.
Thank you for your attention.
