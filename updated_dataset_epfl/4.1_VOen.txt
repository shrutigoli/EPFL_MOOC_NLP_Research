Hello and welcome to this fourth module of this MOOC on protected areas management in Africa.
This module focuses on protected areas management effectiveness.
In short, how to obtain the best results for conservation.
So this week, the module will be structured in the following way.
In the first lesson, we will look at this notion of management effectiveness and the different tools we have to evaluate it in protected areas.
The second lesson concerns a particular aspect of the work in protected areas, namely surveillance of the territory and law enforcement.
Ecological monitoring, the cornerstone to impact assessment will be the subject of the third lesson.
In the fourth lesson we will discuss education on conservation, an essential subject for the future and that we could do an entire MOOC about.
The fifth lesson tackles an approach, which is just developing, to know and recognize the best protected areas in terms of management and governance, which we call the Green List.
The last lesson concerns our weekly convention and we will talk about world heritage this time.
Finally, we will have a quick recap of the important points discussed this week in the form of an animation and your assignment, which relates to that, will be given out.
So here we go.
Have an excellent fourth week with us.
