Welcome to Module Five.
My name is Paul Milligan, I'm an epidemiologist.
I'm based in London at the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and it's my task to introduce to you the last section of this course on implementation research.
The title of this module is
Implementation research in practice.
We started with Pascale Allotey who summarized the key points from the previous modules you've been working through and in the rest of this module we would like to look in more detail at one intervention and weâ€™re going to use this as an example to illustrate how the different principles that you've heard about in the previous modules are applied in practice.
And the example that we've chosen is Seasonal Malaria
Chemoprevention, or SMC.
This is a new approach to malaria control and it's something of an implementation research success story in that countries have been quick to adopt this strategy and deploy it at scale not long after it was recommended by the World Health Organization.
The implementation research on SMC was done in several countries.
In this chapter we're going to hear from investigators in Senegal.
As you'll see, the research was a partnership between researchers and implementers and policy makers and they worked together from the outset.
You will see the different study designs that they used, what the important outcomes were, and the methods that were used to measure them.
And then in chapter three we will look at how this intervention is eventually adopted and implemented and some of the implementation research issues that arose during scaling up.
We will start with an introduction from Peter Olumese from the Global Malaria Program at WHO who is going to set the scene and then we'll see a video that was produced for the National Malaria Control Programme in Senegal to explain about Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention.
For WHO as one of the key things that we do, it's making policies and helping countries to implement policies on strategies, it's essential in making a policy decision.
We look at the efficacy and the safety of the intervention but at the same time also the implementability of the intervention, how easy is it to implement on a wide scale, because for most malaria interventions, the issue is coverage.
The way that you are you able to implement, the way that you are able to reach the audience that requires it, the more you get out of the intervention.
So how easy is it to implement becomes very important.
Is it acceptable, is it doable at low levels of the communities where you want this delivered?
Is it affordable?
So cost effectiveness becomes very important, and also how does this add on to the interventions already on ground?
You don't want to bring in a new intervention that sort of weakens interventions already on ground.
And for all of this to happen you need a lot of implementation research, a lot of real-life situation research that gives you these answers.
And usually for most interventions in the past we tended to do this in series.
First of all, you prove that the intervention works by the researchers and then the next question is â€œcan we implement this?â€� and that takes an additional two-three years trying to answer â€œcan we implement this?â€�.
So we have learnt from experience that it's best to do these as it were, in parallel.
Once you ensure that this intervention would have some reasonable effect, then you also begin to say â€œhow do we implement this?â€�
And so it's very crucial early on at the design and to have both the researchers, the implementers, and the policy makers all sit together and contribute to the development of the strategy and the product.
Of course, at the very early stage you have more input from the science, the researchers, and as you move towards the strategy being fully adopted and implementation, more of the implementers and the policy makers.
But having all of them work together from the very beginning makes a great deal of impact.
And this was the example of the seasonal malaria chemoprevention: we had the researchers, the policy makers and the implementers work together from the very beginning and we can say that on record it's one of those strategies where we have moved very quickly from making a policy recommendation to country adoption and rapid scale-up because most of the questions were answered during the development process of this strategy.
Malaria is still a major public health issue causing over 655 000 deaths in the world.
91% of deaths caused by malaria occur in Sub-Saharan Africa where children under 5 represent over 86% of cases.
That's how Senegal, following the WHO recommendations is implementing a new intervention plan against this disease.
Seasonal malaria chemoprevention or SMC for children from 3 months to 10 years old in strongly endemic regions during the winter peeriod.
The strategy used for SMC is mostly based on the participation of volunteers or community health agents living in the village.
Senegal and its partners have put emphasis on the training of these agents to ensure their mastering of the tools developed at a central level.
Once trained, and following a door to door strategy these agents go around the village and administrate to children from 3 to 120 months old a combination of SP and amodiaquine for 3 to 4 months in some regions during the winter period.
If I've accepted to work for my community it's for me before it's for others.
We know the drug works.
We, community agents, maintain our commitment because this campaign is useful to children.
Where there is value for the population agents have to commit to it.
In addition, we insist very heavily for heads of the family, mothers, to respect the dosage, and that children always sleep under a treated mosquito net, even if the child has received drugs during the campaign.
I am pleased with this campaign that protects my children from malaria.
These agents are supervised by community leaders and by the central level.
SMC gives a very high degree of protection but as we saw in that video from Senegal implementing on a large scale presents some challenges.
The drugs protect for only about four weeks and so the treatment has to be repeated each month and this strict timing is necessary in order to maintain protection throughout the high risk period.
And giving drugs has to be done carefully, there's a nine step process that the health workers have to follow.
They need to check if the child is unwell because those children may not have malaria so they need to go and be tested; they need to check that the child doesn't have allergies to the drugs that are being used and they need to check that the right dose is being given for the child's age and so on.
As Peter Olumese explained at the start of this chapter, implementation needs to be as simple as possible so that it can be delivered effectively at full scale and reach all the population not just those with easier access to health care.
And if it's going to be sustained it needs to fit into the existing activities with health staff without overloading the system.
By about 2006, clinical trials had shown that this approach of giving anti-malaria treatment every month could give a very high degree of protection from malaria and projects were organized in a number of different countries to find out how this intervention could be delivered in practice.
In Senegal, the researchers arranged a series of consultations with senior managers in the Ministry of Health and then with district medical officers and with health post nurses and community health workers to develop the implementation approach that would be used.
Then they did a pilot study of this approach and then this was followed by a larger scale study of the feasibility and the effectiveness.
So we will hear from the investigators who were involved in this:
Doctor Yankhogba Dial and his team will explain about the pilot study and then El Hadj Ba from the research team will explain how the larger scale study was organized.
Often a lot of children would die from malaria in this zone, and there was a problem and nothing specific was really done other than routine interventions.
The parasitology lab of Professor Oumar Gaye contacted us to implement SMC for children.
We knew it was effective but not how to implement it in a whole district because it hadn't ever been done in a district.
And we thought it wasn't a project to discuss just amongst ourselves, it had to be opened up to all stakeholders.
So discussions took place to see if we should give the products to the mothers who would administrate them to children in public or ... what should we do ?
So finally, multi-purpose teams after discussion, proposed to go from door to door.
Three strategies were suggested but we decided to go with the door to door strategy because we thought that strategy would be most effective regarding different community experiences that had taken place in the district.
To do that we adopted three main strategies which were: to insist on awareness before administration because mothers were to administrate both doses so we had to explain this to them so they could give them right.
Then, there were side effects.
Especially with amodiaquine.
Some babies were throwing up and some mothers got worried.
But to reassure them we told them when children present with symptoms or complications they have to present the children to the health services to be managed efficiently.
(INAUDIBLE) effective.
It was a test phase so we had to chose between the different district posts.
The choice was made first of all in relation to the community network: the chosen post needed a very dense network.
Accessibility: to allow supervision and quick intervention in case there were any side effects.
After these meetings we decided to to start the project in the Tivouaoune district and there was a very important step that contributed to its success.
It was the awareness raising and the information campaign in the communities.
At the beginning we prepared an advocacy speech for the community leaders.
We raised awareness with the heads of the villages, the imams, all the leaders in the community.
Everyone was in agreement on the effectiveness of the project, before the implementation but not on the feasibility of the implementation in the district.
So a team of the symposium came to see, at the same time, the acceptation of the intervention: are the populations accepting, or not ?
And there was even a study of the cost: every time we spent money we put it down and it was used to figure out how much it would cost to take care of this intervention.
We showed the results to prove that we could implement this strategy in a district.
But we were also satisfied to see that this intervention was then capitalised on and introduced not only in other regions of Senegal, but also in other countries.
And that was a capital result, I think.
As you've heard in Module Three, which was concerned with the development of new implementation strategies it's very important that these are developed in consultation with implementers, policy makers, and with the community.
And we saw a good example of this from the team in Senegal.
A number of options for delivery of SMC were considered including, delivery at fixed distribution centers and door to door.
We heard that the group preferred the door to door approach  because they had positive experience with this method: they felt people wouldn't come a distribution point, it was necessary to go door to door to ensure good uptake. And door to door health workers have the time to explain the intervention to families and this was felt to be important.
Based on feedback from care givers, they also preferred this approach.
This was only a small scale study but it was clear that the intervention was popular with communities, it could be delivered by lay health workers, the costs were in line with other interventions against malaria but there was still a question of whether the intervention could be delivered on a large scale and so it was necessary to plan a larger study to demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness.
The intervention was introduced in three districts over three years.
It had to be done gradually as this was a completely new approach but during this time, the researchers were able to hand over the responsibility for coordinating the implementation entirely to the district health team so that in the last year of the study the assessment really reflected the real life situation.
El Hadj Ba  from the IRD in Dakar was one of the investigators and he will explain now more about this larger scale study.
Tivaouane served as a pilot, as a pilot for our study.
We did it on a larger scale to prove it's feasible in different contexts.
We did it in a semi-urban zone and a typically rural zone.
And also in contexts where there were differences between zones in terms of the contexts of prevailing morbidity or of sociological and societal questions
So that helped us understand from a logistics point of view how mobilize these logistics in 3 sanitary districts to implement SMC in different contexts regarding geographical and physical accessibility.
It gave us answers to some of our questions regarding the implementation of IPT.
It was to test the feasibility, the acceptation and also the safety, and also the impact of IPT when it's done on a large scale with a minimum of supervision by the health system.
We had to do an evaluation after the implementation which allowed us to know the coverage and the acceptation was measured through interviews with socio-anthropologists.
We have coverage studies with the registries because we had a demographic surveillance system, which allowed to identify the individual, his age, and on the registry we even noted the dose to be given, and it allowed us to know who received it, who didn't, why he didn't received, absences, refusals, and the throwing up.
All of this was noted and it allowed us to do a precise evaluation of the acceptability and of the refusals, and of the losses of drugs with tools used from Tivaouane and adapted to the context to allow us to follow the implementation, to evaluate the loss of drugs.
The cost was evaluated with questionnaires specifically for district doctors and others specifically for investigators to try to trace their daily activity, all that they had to spend during the intervention to procure from health structures, all this was collected.
Costs linked to the supervision, costs linked to buying drugs, costs linked to paying the agents and the other costs were all tallied and it allowed us to find that the SMC for one child protected cost about $1.50.
I think all of this contributes to the SMC being recommended by the WHO, and that was presented at the WHO.
We used the stepped wedge design because since we had already proven that IPT was effective it was not ethical to  have a control arm  and  an intervention arm .
That was the first thing.
And also, malaria changes each year.
So if you conduct a control, maybe the next year the zone can have a superior incidence comparedto the control period.
So that's a problem.
And the other benefit is that in a zone where there was no intervention, that zone can serve as a control for the first zone when it receives the IPT.
So we can compare between zones and inside the zone, before and after.
And that, only the stepped wedge design  system allows it.
We heard  from El Hadj Ba how the intervention was assessed in a range of different settings, and if you recall from Module Two, one of the key messages there was the importance of considering the different situations where an intervention may be used.
El Hadj explained the study included urban and rural populations, it included health facilities with different levels of capacity to coordinate the implementation.
And this was important so that we could find out if the strategy could be effectively delivered in a wide range of settings, if the approach needed to be adapted what the local challenges may have been and how the cost of implementation varied from one place to another.
It may be useful to say at this point a bit more about the outcomes of implementation research and how they're measured.
As you remember from this slide that we saw in Module Four thereâ€™s a range of different outcomes that are specific to implementation research.
Many of these were measured in the studies in Senegal, both in the pilot study and then in the wide arrange of settings in the larger scale study.
Various different methods used to measure these outcomes and you've seen some examples in the studies that we've looked at.
Direct observation was used to record the interactions between health workers and caregivers.
This is important to understand what health workers actually do: are they applying the guidelines as intended, have they adapted the approaches and if so, how?
Fidelity was one of the outcomes mentioned in Module 4.
Is the intervention being administered as intended?
Check lists can be used to record key aspects, a time taken for activities can be recorded and responses of patients and families can be noted.
In-depth interviews with caregivers, with health workers, with policy makers as well, are another important tool, useful for understanding perceptions and attitudes in practice in relation to the intervention.
An interview guide is prepared to ensure key points are covered, the interviews are recorded, then the recording is transcribed wordforword, translated if necessary and analyzed.
Focus group discussions with selected groups, groups of health workers, or groups of caregivers are also used to find out about the groupâ€™s opinions and attitudes in relation to health issues.
These can be very useful but they need to be run by a skilled facilitator.
Then we have quantitative surveys.
Probability sampling techniques are used to select a representative sample of the population, and the survey then measures the coverage by checking record cards, the caregiver is asked about adherence, this is cross checked by looking at any leftover medication.
We may ask about household assets to estimate relative wealth in order to be able to understand if the intervention is reaching the poorer sections of the community.
It's important to assess the costs of delivering the intervention: the various costs of providing the intervention in terms of resources and staff time are itemized in order to estimate the cost of delivery per child and to understand which aspects contribute most to the overall cost.
And we may also include any time and cost incurred by the household for their children to be able to receive the intervention.
Lastly, safety monitoring.
This is done both by active follow-up of the cohort of recipients of the intervention as well as passively by reporting at health facilities when there are patients with complaints of side-effects.
Safety wasn't listed as one of the outcomes in Module Four but it is an important aspect to implementation research in mass drug administration.
If relatively minor side-effects are common this may make the intervention less acceptable.
If severe cases occur, these need to be responded to immediately, the causes understood and measures put in place to avoid them in future.
This may involve changes being made in how the intervention is administered.
The researchers were a part of an international group of those involved in research on SMC and this group met with policy makers at WHO to review the accumulating evidence and identify gaps, and key points that emerged from that were the need to ensure consistency with existing policies on drug treatment for malaria.
Children who are unwell should be tested as they may not have malaria so the SMC program should screen and refer those children.
There was a need identified for more extensive data on safety and on cost of delivery and so it was possible to strengthen the research in those areas.
And it was important to define the geographical regions where the intervention will be most useful in order to know how many children could potentially benefit from this intervention.
A new strategy will be introduced into an existing health system: the new strategy needs to be integrated as far as possible with other activities if it's going to be sustainable.
And specific studies may be useful to investigate if particular strategies can be combined to make sure there's no negative impact.
Jean Louis DNiaye from the University Cheikh Anta Diop, Dakar will give us an example now of this kind of study.
Seasonal malaria chemoprevention was added to pre-existing strategies especially in the South of Senegal where home management also called "pecadom" already existed.
"Pecadom" is the strategy and "Desdom" is the healthcare specialist.
He is a voluntary actor chosen by his community to provide healthcare for his community.
So generally it's somebody we train to treat malaria and for some time they've also been trained to treat acute respiratory diseases and diarrhea.
We really needed to set up a study to see the feasibility of combining both of these strategies.
To do this, to check the feasibility of the combination of
"pecadom" and SMC we chose a technique using randomised clinic trials in clusters, choosing randomly 12 villages that implemented "pecadom" and SMC and 12 villages where there was only "pecadom".
During the intervention phase we showed the combination was largely feasible.
And [it had] an added value because agents doing "pecadom" and SMC had less work than the other agents.
By combining "pecadom" and SMC we showed a protective efficacity of over 83%.
So there was 83% less malaria in the zone with SMC and "pecadom" compared to "pecadom" only.
This showed the decrease in the work load of the community health agents in the SMC intervention.
This SMC added value allowed us to use a screening programme for this strategy and the results allowed national programs to combine this strategy with "pecadom" in zones where "pecadom" exists.
This was a good example of a relatively simple study that answered an important practical question about implementation of the new strategy in a specific context.
Did you notice the study design that was used?
If you remember in Module Three
Neil Alexander spoke about the choice of study design.
We have now seen several different study designs that have been used in the work in Senegal.
We've heard first from Doctor Dial and his team and they described an implementation research study that involved piloting the intervention in a small area without a control group and evaluating it using a mixture of quantitative surveys and qualitative methods.
Then, El Hadj Ba described a large scale feasibility study.
This used a stepped wedge design.
And finally, Jean Louis described a cluster randomized trial.
The key message here is that the study design depends on the question to be answered.
The study may be the large study, or a small study depending on the objectives, but in all cases care is needed in developing the design and this needs to be done with a multi-disciplinary team.
Unlike more controlled intervention trials, in implementation research we're concerned with how the intervention fits in the broader health system and this involves considering the various interactions that could occur.
In the studies that we've seen, a useful tool that was used in designing the studies was a conceptual framework. And we're going to end this chapter with an example of how these frameworks are developed.
When planning an implementation research project it is useful to prepare a conceptual diagram.
These diagrams were introduced in Module Four and we'll look now at an example applied to SMC.
So we set up the intervention on the left and its desired effect on the right, and then we add the pathway of how the implementation works.
So, for instance, here we have monthly administration of drugs but children are first screened for illness and those who are unwell are referred for diagnosis and after they have been treated they may then get SMC, so that needs to be added into the pathway.
And then the next step is to add the conditions for each step to work as intended.
So there may be quite a number of these of different types.
Finally we mark which outcomes will be monitored.
So some may need counter factual analysis, that is comparison with a control group of some sort.
Many outcomes can be measured directly without a comparison group.
We can't monitor every aspect and so some of these must remain as assumptions.
It's important to consider unintended consequences.
For example, we'd be concerned if families stopped using other preventive measures, or delayed treatment seeking as an indirect result of our intervention.
And we can see these in the diagram and we may want to try to monitor those effects.
The more down-stream public health outcomes are outside our focus on implementation research but it may be possible to measure some of these outcomes in an implementation research project and if so, it is important to do so to add to the evidence supporting the intervention.
Infectious diseases are complex systems: the situation may change, there can be unexpected consequences.
How best to monitor these trends may itself need some research.
Monitoring guidelines will be needed and we'll have to be prepared then to adapt the intervention approach in response to changing situations.
