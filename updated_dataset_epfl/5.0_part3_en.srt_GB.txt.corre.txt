Welcome back to part 3 of this chapter 5.
I have somewhat rearranged the figures that Peter Hore has chosen to illustrate this chapter by starting with an example taken from proteins.
Indeed, the determination of the structure of proteins is one of the principal applications of the Overhauser effect today.
Recall that proteins are large molecules and therefore tumble slowly and therefore the Overhauser Effect is dominated by the zero-quantum transition probability between near-degenerate spin states, that is to say, the flip-flop rate, so that the Overhauser Effect leads to a loss in signal.
Proteins, as you should know, are basically polymers of amino acids.
Each amino acid contains a number of protons and these protons can be assigned by methods that we shall discuss in Chapter 6.
Since the Overhauser Effect is predominantly driven by flip-flop terms, it tends to attenuate signals.
So, the question really is, if we irradiate selectively a proton that is attached to amino acid number a, could it be that a proton attached to amino acid number d is partly attenuated because of the Overhauser Effect.
If that occurs, we must come to the conclusion that amino acid a must be close in space to amino acid d, because the vehicle that allows the Overhauser effect to occur is the dipole-dipole interaction, which, as we have seen, decreases as the sixth power of the distance.
So, we come to the conclusion that the protein cannot be a linear chain but that amino acids a and d must be close in space.
Likewise, we can do an experiment where we irradiate a proton belonging to amino acid b, and we find that there is an attenuation of the signal of a proton of amino acid f, and we come to the conclusion that b and f must be close in space, and likewise c and d, etc.
In fact, one can typically determine hundreds or even thousands of so-called â€œdistance restraintsâ€� and conclude that certain pairs of amino acids must be close together in space.
It is one of the merits of Kurt WÃ¼thrich at ETH in ZÃ¼rich to have shown that if you have a sufficient number of such restraints, you can determine a unique structure-- not just a structure that satisfies all restraints, but that there is only one structure that fullfills all of them at the same time.
This is one of the reasons why Kurt WÃ¼thrich got a Nobel Prize in 2002.
Although applications to proteins are very important nowadays, we should not forget that we can also use
Overhauser effects very fruitfully for stereo chemistry in simple molecules.
This is a case where a simple molecule here has been substituted by introducing trimethylsilane groups.
A question that one may ask is whether the silane group is attached here at the top or here at the bottom.
It's not so easy to distinguish between these two.
Of course, the molecular mass is exactly the same and many features are very similar between these two isomers.
But, if we decide to irradiate the resonances of the methyl groups of the silane, then we see in this case an enhancement of this aromatic proton here and an enhancement of that aromatic proton there, whereas, if we do the same experiment-- if we saturate the transitions of the methyl group attached to the silane in this isomer, then we would only enhance one aromatic proton.
So, the answer is very simply: if two protons are enhanced, we have this isomer, but if there is only one enhanced proton, we have the other isomer.
We can confirm this by irradiating this proton here, which stands out in the spectrum.
Again, for the isomer on the left-hand side, we would expect an amplification of two aromatic protons, whereas, in the isomer on the right-hand side, we would expect an amplification of only one of the aromatic protons.
So, this is a very convenient way of deciding where the new group has been attached.
Overhauser effects are not the only useful methods to determine structures and assign resonances.
Sometimes it can be useful simply to measure the T1 of carbon-13.
This adamantane is a famous molecule, which has two different carbon-13 sitesâ€” in this position and in that position.
The obvious difference is that this carbon has only one proton attached to it, whereas this carbon carries two protons.
Consequently, this carbon-13 is exposed to fluctuating fields due to the dipolar interaction between itself and its unique attached proton, whereas this carbon-13 is exposed to more intense fluctuating fields that stem from two neighbouring protons.
Consequently, the relaxation of this carbon is almost twice as fast as the relaxation of that carbon, or if you prefer, the T1 of this carbon is almost twice as short as the T1 of that carbon.
This is an elegant example of how you can use T1 of carbon-13 to determine the assignment.
Sometimes it is useful to measure both the spin-lattice or T1 relaxation times and the Overhauser enhancements on carbon-13.
Take this molecule here, where we see that the methine, that is to say, the CH carbons, all have T1â€™s of about two seconds, whereas the quaternary carbons have far longer T1â€™s.
The obvious reason is that the protons that are responsible for fluctuating fields at the sites of these carbons, f to i, are further away.
The reason is obvious, namely that the protons that are responsible for relaxation of these carbons here are further away, since the carbons are quaternary, whereas these have protons that are directly attached to the carbons.
We can also see that the Overhauser effects, which, as you will recall, should have at best eta = 2, but eta varies from one situation to another depending on the complexity of the relaxation pathways.
For quaternary carbons, the Overhauser effects are very weak.
In some cases, T1 relaxation allows us to gain subtle insight into molecular behaviour.
This example refers to measurements of longitudinal spin-lattice relaxation of carbon-13 in methyl-substituted benzenes.
If the methyl groups are not crowded, they do not interfere with each other, and the T1 relaxation times of the carbons are rather long.
In this case, however, there is a steric hindrance between the two methyl groups.
I wouldn't say that they touch each other, but they interfere.
This is sometimes known as a cog-wheel interaction.
The idea is that the protons on these two groups almost touch each other, although that's perhaps more a view of the mind.
Whatever the mechanism is, it is striking that the relaxation becomes much faster.
Clearly, if we plot relaxation times as a function of correlation time-- you will recall that there is a curve that goes through a minimum-- we have faster T1 relaxation because the correlation time of the cogwheel motion is slowed down compared to the correlation times of the unhindered freely rotating methyl groups.
There are some more exotic effects which are worth understanding to prevent misinterpretation of observations.
This example is concerned with T1 relaxation of carbon-13 in this rather strange cigar-shaped molecule.
If you have a molecule like that, then of course it's much easier to have it rotate around its long axis-- or the rotational diffusion coefficient around that axis will be much faster than the rotational diffusion coefficient around a perpendicular axis.
Thus there is an anisotropy of the rotational diffusion tensor.
In this case, the authors have determined large differences in T1 relaxation times, about 1 and 5 s, depending if we are in the para-, ortho- or meta-positions.
We can explain that if we consider the relevant correlation time, not of the overall tumbling of the molecule, but the correlation time that is relevant for the reorientation of the carbon-proton vectors that are either in the para-position, or in the meta- and ortho-positions.
If we recall this curve, it turns out that for the para-position, we have a rather long correlation time-- remember that it takes slow tumbling to move this carbon-- whereas for the ortho- and meta-positions we have a shorter correlation time, and therefore a longer T1.
It is interesting that T1 relaxation of carbon-13 gives us insight not only of molecular motions but also of the viscosity of the environment.
Particularly when the molecules are capable of forming intermolecular hydrogen bonds.
Take the simple case of decane.
In fact, there are only five distinguishable carbons because of the symmetry, and they turn out to have roughly equal T1â€™s, so that is not very interesting.
But if we go to decanol, where the first carbon carries an OH group, then we see a vast range of T1 relaxation times.
The C1 carbon, which is weakly bound to a neighbouring molecule through hydrogen bonds, has a very short relaxation time.
As we go down the chain, the relaxation times of the carbons increase.
If we consider C20, it has a smaller range of relaxation times.
Although there are no hydrogen bonds in the case, the bulk of the molecule is partly immobilized because of its inertia.
Relaxation is not limited to liquids.
It can also be studied in solids.
Indeed, Raymond Andrew and his coworkers have done this in the '50s--
Raymond Andrew also invented magic angle spinning, which is a remarkable invention.
He studied relaxation and line widths in solids at low temperatures.
He found that if you freeze benzene, it looks like a crystal or a glass, but if you're in a temperature range between 200 and 130 K (Kelvin), the lines are fairly narrow because there is residual motion in the solid, a rotation around the six-fold axis.
But if the temperature goes below 100 K, you can freeze this rotation and you have a true rigid solid, so that the line width becomes much broader-- speaking of the proton line width.
Likewise, if you look at T1 relaxation of protons in benzene, there is a minimum that corresponds to a situation where the rotational motion has about the same frequency as the Larmor frequency.
These minima depend on the spectrometer that you use for their observation.
So far, we have talked about â€œlongitudinalâ€� or â€œspin-latticeâ€� relaxation.
We now briefly mention â€œtransverseâ€� relaxation, also known as â€œspin-spinâ€� relaxation.
The main manifestation of transverse relaxation is that it leads to line broadening.
If relaxation is responsible for the line width, it is sufficient to measure this line width at half height. 
The T2 relaxation time is inversely proportional through a simple relationship.
It turns out that the transverse relaxation rate, called R2, which is the inverse of T2, is made up of two important contributions.
This first contribution we have seen before, because that is also responsible for longitudinal relaxation, and it depends on the spectral density at the Larmor frequency.
But for T2 relaxation, there is also a term that corresponds to the spectral density at the origin, at zero frequency, that corresponds to a lack of motion.
You will note that these two terms both have coefficients of 1/2, so, if the two spectral densities are equal, then you can lump them together, but that is only the case in extreme narrowing, when the correlation time is much shorter than the inverse of the Larmor frequency.
In general, when you move from fast-tumbling molecules-- remember that 10^-12 s or a picosecond is characteristic for water-- then T1 and T2 are equal, and as we have seen before, there is a minimum for T1.
T1 increases again as we go to larger molecules.
That is not so for T2.
As you can see from this graph,
T2 inexorably decreases, becomes shorter and shorter.
That means that the line widths become larger and larger, and that means that, unfortunately, it is impossible to observe proton or carbon-13 signals of very large molecules without doing some smart things.
So, to summarize Chapter 5, we shall look at the bullets that Peter Hore has given at the end of his chapter.
Nuclear spins attain thermal equilibrium-- that is to say, the Boltzmann equilibrium-- by a process known as spin-lattice relaxation, also known as longitudinal relaxation, that drives the populations of the energy levels back towards equilibrium.
Spin-spin relaxation, also known as transverse relaxation, results in NMR line broadening.
Spin-lattice and spin-spin relaxation times are known as T1 and T2.
Spin relaxation is caused by modulations of interactions between spins that are due to molecular motions.
Dipolar interactions are made time-dependent by molecular tumbling, and they are a common source of spin relaxation.
Dipolar couplings also cause cross-relaxation, which leads to the Nuclear Overhauser Effect.
T1s and T2s and NOEs give information both on molecular structure and on motion.
Thank you for your attention.
