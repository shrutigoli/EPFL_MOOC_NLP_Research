Lets start by a nonlinear equation.
The problem we wish to solve is the following:
Let f be a  continuous function defined from R to R, we are searching for x_bar such that f(x_bar) is equal to 0.
Here is the graph of the function f in the x-y plane: y is equal to f(x).
I search x_bar such that f(x_bar) is equal to 0.
We say that x_bar is the zero of the function f,
I will write the problem in another equivalent way: that is I seek x_bar, the same x_bar as this one, such that x_bar = g(x_bar).
In this case we say that x_bar is a fixed point of the function g. 
I draw the graph of the function g in the x-y plane.
You see here the first bisectrix, and here the graph of the function g, and I seek x_bar such that x_bar is equal to g(x_bar).
How to get from the function f to the function g? 
Well, for example, we define g(x) equal to x minus f(x), so that when I evaluate this function in x_bar,
I get g(x_bar) equal to x_bar minus f(x_bar) which is null.
I could also define g(x) equal to x minus alpha times f(x) for any non-zero alpha.
Well in this case, like previously, x_bar is a zero of f(x) if and only if x_bar is a fixed point of g.
In the case of Newton's method we can observe that, and this will be done later on, that alpha is nothing but
1 over the derivative of f.
The method I suggest to find x_bar a fixed point of g is the following.
It is called a fixed point method. 
Given x_0 in R, which is an approximation of x_bar, for example, here is x_0.
We shall calculate x_1 equal to g(x_0).
Here we have x_0, and this is x_1 equal to g(x_0).
I carry x_1 on to the x axis, here is x_1.
Next I calculate x_2 equal to g(x_1), and by continuing on this figure, x_2 equal to g(x_1) will be here. 
I carry on the x-axis the value of x_2.
In general, for a given x_n,
I can calculate x_n+1 defined as g(x_n).
The first remark is that the sequence x_n converges, and if the function g is continuous then the limit when n goes to infinity of x_n satisfies, let x_bar be this limit, x_bar is the limit of x_n as n goes to infinity, then x_bar is equal to g(x_bar). 
This means I have effectively found x_bar which is a fixed point of g.
Why? well it is sufficient to take the limit in the left hand side and the limit in the right hand side of this equality, since g is continuous
I can swap the limit and the function g, and I get x_bar equal to g(x_bar).
Now the fundamental question is:
Does the sequence converge?
The sequence x_n, defined by x_n+1 equal to g(x_n), does it converge? 
The answer, we shall see later in theorem 8.3, depends on the function g at x_bar, x_bar being the fixed point of g, and on the initial guess x_0.
