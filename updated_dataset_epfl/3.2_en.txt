In this lecture we will see how radiation interacts with the interstellar and intergalactic matter.
Interactions occur at all spatial scales and are analysed thanks to images and spectra giving constraints on the physical conditions of the gas and dust in cosmic clouds.
The interstellar gas, apart from the primordial hydrogen and helium formed a few moments after the Big Bang, is created by successive generations of stars and is ejected into the interstellar medium after the death of high- or low-mass stars. 
For low mass stars, i.e. less massive than 8 solar masses, planetary nebulae are formed, while for the stars with masses exceeding 8 solar masses, a supernova explosion occurs leaving spectacular filaments as shown in the figure.
This image shows the Crab nebula,
Messier 1 that is a result of the supernova explosion visible even to the naked eye in 1054.
Then, the gas is recycled into the interstellar medium, in a galaxy like this one, 
Messier 51, where the hydrogen emission is well visible in the red in the spiral arms of the galaxy.
The hydrogen emission is created by the ionised gas excited by the swarm of young massive stars visible in the blue in the arms of the galaxy .
Apart from the gas in galaxies, there is also dust that absorbs background radiation.
This effect can be seen here in the form of dark trails through the arms of the galaxy.
The background light is absorbed by dust.
From this mix of gas and dust, new generations of stars, possibly with associated planetary systems are formed.
Let's see in details what is happening in a nebula.
The Carina nebula shown here at optical wavelengths.
Some sources of ionisation can easily be identified, like in this place - a small stellar cluster certainly composed of young hot stars.
Another stellar cluster can be seen here. 
Those stars ionize the surrounding gas. 
The gas divides into protons and electrons.
Possibly, they will recombine, electrons fall back into the lower energy level while at the same time emitting photons with a range of wavelengths.
Each colour indicates a different emission line, as it was shown in previous chapters.
The density of the gas is very low, roughly one gas particle per cmÂ³, which gives 
Ï� = 10^-21 kg/mÂ³.
There can be great differences in the densities from one nebula to the other, from one galaxy to the other.
This density corresponds to the ionised gas that often produces emission lines. We find also dusty regions, similar to those shown before in the spiral galaxy.
Dust absorbs radiation.
In fact, this whole region is affected by dust absorption.
Mass densities in this kind of regions are even lower, about 10 ^-13 particles per cmÂ³ which is 10 ^ 13 times smaller than the gas density.
On the other hand, dust particles are much heavier because the dust is composed of atoms and molecules.
The mass density is of the order of 
10^ -23 kg/mÂ³.
This means that there is 13 orders of magnitude less dust particles than in the gas, but in mass density dust is only 100 times less massive per unit volume than gas.
All we said previously was about gas and dust in nebulae,
Let's now have a closer look at the Milky Way.
So objects with much larger spatial scales, from this place to this other one in the slide the distance is about 5 kiloparsec.
On the previous slide the scale was about tens of parsec.
Here, the scale corresponds to the kiloparsec scale.
The nebula that was shown just before has roughly this size, quite small comparing to the Milky Way.
On the other hand, dust extends over a large region, those areas correspond to dusty spots that absorb the light coming from the stars situated behind.
Here are other dust regions.
In conclusion, the dust and the gas intervene at all scales.
Let's take a look at what is happening with the ionised gas that recombines and emits radiation creating something we can observe nebulae.
Here we will assume a gaseous nebula composed of hydrogen, so as to simplify the calculations.
Of course, the composition could well be different in this kind of cloud.
Then, here is a ionizing source: stars.
This ionizing source splits the atoms, of hydrogen in this case, into protons and electrons.
They do not stay in this state, they will tend to recombine and emit light.
Now, we will try to estimate the typical radius of a nebula that is the StrÃ¶mgren radius, after the astronomer who calculated it for the first time.
What we will try to characterise is this limiting radius of the nebula, the StrÃ¶mgren radius.
As always in science, there is an equilibrium. 
There are ionising photons coming from the source, from the centre of the nebula.
Then, there are electrons that recombine with the protons that were inonized by the radiation field. 
The flux of ionizing photons is equal to the recombination ratio of the proton-electron pairs. 
The number of recombinations is equal to the volume of the nebula:
4/3 pi x r^3 times the number of available proton-electron pairs, that is  <i>ne</i> for electrons and <i>nh</i> for protons.
In this equation, there is also a constant that comes from quantum mechanics, and the origins of which is not needed to be known here.
It is just a physical constant that is equal to about 3 x 10 ^-13 cm^3*s^-1 for a gas of with temperature around 8000K which is a typical temperature for diffuse nebulae. 
We have calculated the recombination ratio as a function of radius - the parameter that we are interested in, and the electron and proton density in the nebula.
Now, let's calculate the number of ionizing photons.
For the calculations we take a hot star as a ionizing source with the temperature of about 45000K.
This star has a black body spectrum with its luminosity peak in the ultraviolet.
According to the Wien law,  Î»max is equal to 640 Ã… which is in the ultraviolet part of the spectrum where the photons carry a lot of energy and so they can easily ionize matter.
Here we have a nebula composed of ionised hydrogen.
Before the calculations, lets recall a bit of nomenclature.
We have talked a lot about hydrogen, so lets now present some notations.
It may be that you are familiar with it, so treat it as a reminder.
If you have such a notation: 1H it stands for an hydrogen nucleus.
A notation 2H stands for a deuterium nucleus.
In this case there is one extra neutron in the nucleus.
Lets move on to atoms, so we have now also an electron, that we note as HI. this is an atom of neutral hydrogen.
The electron in this atom is in its lowest possible energy state with -13.6 eV.
It means that in order to ionise an hydrogen atom, 13.6 eV must be delivered.
In this case, one notes HII for the ionized hydrogen.
Earlier, a notation 
HÎ±, HÎ², HÎ³, etc. was shown. 
Pay attention not to confuse it with the notation that  was shown before.
Those are the hydrogen emission lines.
We can also write H2 which indicates that two hydrogen atoms now form a molecule.
So, beware of all the different notations.
That is all for the hydrogen nebula.
Now, let's recall that we consider a single star with 45000K in the centre of the nebula.
The radiation peak is at 640 Ã…. 
And, assuming that most photons belong to that peak, each photon has about the energy EÎ³ = hÎ½
Then, let us imagine that all photons are indeed emitted at the peak,
Thus, all photons have precisely that energy:
The total amounts to 1,54 10^-5 J which corresponds to 19 eV.
Obviously, those are photons with an energy higher than
 the ionisation energy: 13.6eV.
It means that if a star surrounded by hydrogen is considered, then, with a good approximation, all the hydrogen in the nebula is ionized. because of the photon flux carrying an energy higher than the hydrogen ionization energy.
Now, we assume that all the hydrogen is ionized and so ne = nH, and there is the same number of electrons than protons.
This implies that the equation for the recombination ratio can be rewritten as a function of the hydrogen atom density, and it is equal to the photon flux carrying an energy at least sufficient to ionize the atoms.
Inverting this equation, we find the radius that is the limiting radius in the equilibrium, the  StrÃ¶mgren radius.
It will be equal to three times the number of ionizing photons over 4Ï€Î± times nHÂ² to the power 1/3.
This is the equation for the StrÃ¶mgren radius.
It is given as a function of the following values: a physical constant, the density of the nebula and the number of ionizing photons.
The number of the ionizing photons can be estimated.
In the easiest way, it is the stellar luminosity the stellar luminosity in the centre of the nebula divided by the photon energy.
For a star with a surface temperature
T* = 45 000K the luminosity is equal to
1,3 x10^5  solar luminosity.
This implies that the number of ionizing photons is equal to 1,6 10^49 photons/s.
This gives an estimate of the number of ionizing photons.
Lets now estimate NH.
For NH = 5000 / cm3 the nebula is relatively dense, and the Stromgren radius is roughly equal to 0.3 parsec.
This radius depends on the number of stars in the nebula, but typically the StrÃ¶mgren radius is about 0.1 - 100 parsec for a typical nebula in the Milky Way ionized by a small stellar cluster. a small stellar cluster.
This is the order of magnitude of the size of ionized nebulae that can be found in the Milky Way, or in galaxies in general.
This is a wonderful example of a nebula illustrating the StrÃ¶mgren sphere - 
NGC602 in the Small Magellanic Cloud which is a satellite galaxy of our Galaxy.
Here one can see a group of blue stars in the centre of the nebula that ionizes the gas as far as 50 parsec from the centre.
This does not imply that the nebula has its limit at 50 parsec and that there is no gas further away.
What it means is that the photon flux produced by the stars in the centre of nebula is not able to ionize the gas further away than the StrÃ¶mgren radius.
Now we will look closer at the dust absorption.
Here you can see schematically represented some dust grains with sizes much larger than the atoms or molecules.
It can be compared to the dust that is on a table when one does not clean at his place, or to the chalk left on the blackboard, for example.
Let's take a volume element that is characterised by the length, input and output surfaces, and the density taken in a following way.
This is the numerical density, not the mass density, so it gives the number of dust grains per unit volume.
One can see clearly that each dust grain obscures the light that enters the volume element. 
Each dust grain has a cross section that obscures a surface <i>dA</i>.
This allows the determination of the extinction coefficient that is simply equal to, if <i>r</i> is the grain radius, the cross section of the dust grains.
Now it is possible to estimate the fraction of the surface <i>dA</i> screened by all the dust grains.
This would be simply <i>dÏ„</i> - the number of the particles in the box times the cross section which we have called the extinction coefficient.
So dÏ„ is equal to n*dA*dl, where l is the cylinder volume, times the cross section over the total surface.
If this expression is simplified, one has the extinction coefficient times the density times the element dl.
This will be called the optical depth Ï„.
This is a dimensionless quantity that depends on distances.
One can already see that Ï„max = 1 corresponds to full extinction because the obscured surface is equal to dA and so all the radiation is absorbed.
This is the definition of the optical depth.
Let's see how to use it in order to estimate the fraction of flux that is lost, if we have the incident flux here in a given volume.
F' is the outgoing flux that is equal to F + dF,
F can be negative and will be in this case as there is absorption. dF=F*dÏ„, dÏ„ is the optical depth or, as it was called earlier, the fraction of the flux that is lost.
There is a minus sign because of the losses, and so dF/F = -dÏ„.
This is a simple equation for which the solution can be written as an exponential with boundary condition that is simply the incident flux.
The outgoing flux varies with respect to the incident flux.
Ï„ is the integral from 0 to the distance of the observer, so it can be integrated along the line of sight up to the star at some distance D. Here we have n times the extinction coefficient times dl.
If we assume that there is on average n particles along the line of sight, we can simplify this expression.
Ï„ would be n mean times the extinction coefficient times the distance.
This is the result of the integral with the assumption that the number of particles can be approximated by some mean value from the distance 0 to the observed object at some distance D.
So the integration is made from one volume element to another.
The integration of the flux that is lost by a volume element because of the dust grains between the source and the observer.
The fraction of the flux that is lost is called the extinction.
Rewriting the resulting formula:
F depends on the distance of the observed object so that F(D) = F0 x e ^Ï„(D).
Let's try to illustrate it on a graph.
It is simply an exponential curve.
The y axis represents the flux, and the x axis - the distance.
At distance 0 the flux is equal to F0, this is the condition given in the formula.
When Ï„ = 0, the exponent is equal to 1 so F=F0. Then, the flux is exponentially decreasing.
At some distance D, we have Ï„(D) when Ï„ =1, the flux is equal to F0 / e which means that 1/e times the flux F0 is lost up to the optical path equal to 1.
Astrophysicists prefer to use magnitudes, let's take its definition: observed magnitude minus the intrinsic magnitude before the absorption caused by the dust along the line of sight from 0 to the distance D.
This is a situation in which along the line of sight between the observer and a star there is dust in cylinders, in nebulae etc.
One has to integrate the absorption along the line of sight up to some distance D.
Thus, m - m0 = - 2.5 * log [F(D) / F0].
Using the equation formulated before, this is equal to 2.5 * Ï„(D), but one has to pay attention to log(e) - this is a decimal logarithm and not a natural logarithm.
One can see that m - m0 is positive what implies that m is greater than m0.
Remember that the magnitude scale is logarithmic.
There is a minus sign here meaning that the observed source is seen with apparent magnitude greater than m0 which is the intrinsic magnitude before the absorption.
This signifies that the source is seen absorbed, and so fainter than the original. 
We have just talked about absorption but this is not the only effect present in a volume element.
Some photons that will be absorbed, some can be reflected back to the source, some reflected in an arbitrary direction, some reflected in an arbitrary direction.
This extremely important effect is called scattering.
This effect will not de described here in details, it will be qualitatively shown how scattering depends on the particle's radii.
There are two types of scattering.
When photons propagate through dust they are scattered in the same way fog would do
When photons propagate through dust they are scattered in the same way fog would do.
The first type of scattering is the Mie scattering.
It takes place when the radius of the grains is much larger than the photon's wavelength.
In this case the extinction coefficient is equal to the one given by the Mie scattering which is proportional to Î»^-1.
Another property is that this type of scattering is directional, it is not isotropic â€“ it means that photon do not scatter in a random direction.
They rather scatter in a direction that lies closer to the incidence direction.
This is the Mie scattering.
Another type of scattering is the Rayleigh scattering that takes place when the medium consists of small particles - smaller than the wavelength.
For this type of scattering, the extinction coefficient depends even stronger on the wavelength, as Î»^-4.
Rayleigh scattering is isotropic.
In conclusion, if light is scattered by large grains the scattering is directional and is more effective for shorter wavelengths.
The dependence law is Î»^-1.
The Rayleigh scattering arises for small particles, it is isotropic and also depends on the wavelength.
It is more effective for the blue light than for the red light because of the dependence of the extinction coefficient as Î» ^-4.
Both types of scattering are more effective for shorter wavelengths.
The consequence of the scattering can be observed on Earth.
Both types of scattering can be noticed on this slide.
Firstly, the scattering that makes the sky blue.
This is the scattering by atoms, so all the particles, whose radius is very small compared to the wavelength.
The wavelength is of the order of hundreds or thousands of AngstrÃ¶m.
Obviously, it is the case of the Rayleigh scattering that is isotropic.
It was said that the scattering is more effective for bluer light.
This is the reason why the sky is blue and why there are no visible structures.
The uniform blue colour is caused by the isotropic property.
Now, what happens in the cloud ?
The cloud is composed of water drops,
So here we can find droplets of water with radii much larger than the wavelength.
In this case, the leading process is the Mie scattering that is directional.
This is the reason why one can see obvious structures in clouds.
If the scattering was isotropic the structures would not be visible in the clouds.
It works in the same way for nebulae that are also clouds.
Here is a reflection nebula
M78 in the constellation of Orion.
Reflection or diffusion nebula, it is basically the same.
In the centre of the nebula there are stars, one can find some dusty regions that absorb light.
There will be an extinction coefficient is related to these areas.
There are also some areas where the light is scattered.
How to see this in practice ?
The spectrum of a star is a black body spectrum.
The spectrum of a nebula should be composed of emission lines because of atoms that can be ionized by stars.
After the ionization, they recombine and generate emission lines.
But this is not the case here.
Those stars are not able to ionize the surrounding matter.
Instead, the light is scattered.
If the spectrum was taken in this area, it would be a black body spectrum, the same spectrum that the one of the stars illuminating the matter around them.
That is why obtaining spectra of astronomical objects is so important.
If one has a spectrum that shows lines, the effects present in a nebula are not the same as for a nebula that has a black body spectrum.
In the latter case there is  light scattering while in the former case atoms are ionized and then they recombine.
What is the final balance between the different processes?
In the nebula, there is  light scattering and the absorption that both are more effective for shorter wavelengths.
That implies two things:
The first one, the absorption is responsible for the fact that the observer sees a source weaker as if it was emitting less light.
Also, if the light is absorbed or scattered more effetively for shorter wavelengths, it implies that sources observed through dust are reddened.
This is the interstellar and intergalactic reddening.
This was the first conclusion.
Now, if one wants to observe sources whose light is strongly absorbed, the observations must be done in the infrared.
Light with longer wavelength propagates through matter more easily.
The observations are not so simple because it may happen that the source does not emit light at longer wavelengths.
One has to adapt the means to the goal of the observations at least as far as observations through dust is concerned.
Let's look at the quantitative description of reddening and its influence magnitudes.
It was said that the colour of objects is measured using the colour index, the intrinsic index.
It will be called
(B-V)0 and is equal to B0 - V0.
B is linked to B0 through absorption which can be in turn expressed as an optical depth. 
This is for the blue filter.
Now for the V filter, which is redder than B.
One has two magnitudes, both are affected by absorption.
Subtracting one equation from the other gives B-V = (B-V)0 - (Av-Ab) with Ab > Av because the blue light is absorbed stronger as it was seen before.
This equation can be rewritten as
(B-V)0 minus a new term E(B-V) that is used to characterise the reddening of stars.
E(B-V) is the colour excess. 
(B-V ) > (B-V)0 because Ab > Av.
It was shown that large colour indices correspond to red stars; smaller colour indices correspond to bluer stars provided that the bluer filter is placed on the left side of the index.
The observed index is greater than the intrinsic index what implies that the observed source is reddened.
Thanks to the colour indices and to the colour excess it is possible to quantify the way in which the stellar objects are reddened by dust in the interstellar and intergalactic medium.
A direct illustration of this effect: a nebula, in fact a cloud composed of dust, seen at different wavelengths.
This image corresponds to the optical wavelength - the limit in the blue light.
This image was taken in near infrared.
The wavelengths increases in this way across the slide.
This is the infrared image.
One can easily see that in the image with the dust all the radiation from the background is blocked and scattered by the dust.
It is lost, it does not reach the observer.
We going further In the near infrared, one can see more and more stars near the edge of the nebula one can see more and more stars
One can see more and more stars when going to the center 
Even more at longer wavelengths.
In this image almost all the stars can be seen through the dust.
This is a cloud of dust in the Milky Way -
Barnard 68 that can be delimited in this way.
This is an image in false colour with the visible light in the blue channel, the near infrared in the green channel, and the infrared in the red channel.
Looking at this image one can at once see a large cloud of dust located along the line of sight to the observer.
Light constantly interacts with matter.
Thanks to these interactions the analysis of the light gives us valuable informations.
The last two lectures showed that this analysis is quite delicate.
All the physical processes at play must be taken into account simultaneously: continuous absorption or absorption lines, continuous emission or emission lines, chromatic absorption, reflection, scattering which, in fact, is also a chromatic phenomenon.
Also, one needs to consider chromatic effects caused by the Doppler effect, rotation, thermal agitation of molecules that sometimes broaden emission and absorption lines.
All these phenomena play a role at some point, an important role in our understanding of astronomical objects.
