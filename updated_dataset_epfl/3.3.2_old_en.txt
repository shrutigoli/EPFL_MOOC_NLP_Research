Planet Earth is not a perfect sphere.
We all know that.
In fact, it has a very complex shape.
But the major deviation from the sphere is the equatorial bulge.
It's somewhat of a flattened Earth because of the rotation on itself.
The difference between the equatorial radius and the polar radius is about 21 km, so with the flattening of 1 / 298.
Now, we have two consequences because of that shape of the Earth, a deviation from the pure spherical shape.
On one hand, we have the so-called 
<i>nodal regression</i> for orbits that have an inclination of more than 0 and less than 90,
Orbits that are basically to the east, we are going to have a nodal regression, the line of nodes will be moving to the west, and for inclinations that are larger than 90 degrees we have, I would say, a <i>nodal progression,</i> the line of node will be drifting to the east.
There is another consequence that the rotation of the line of apsides within the plane of the orbit.
We will not cover this in this course, we'll only cover the nodal regression or nodal progression.
Now, why do we have a nodal regression?
Let's look at this picture here.
We have of course exaggerated flattened Earth but it is in order to better represent what is happening.
Now we have the satellite at this point, we have the radius <i>r</i> from the center of the Earth.
And now because of the flattening of the Earth, the force exercised on the satellite is not exactly a central force.
It is not directed to the center of the Earth but there is a component downwards because of the equatorial bulge.
It's represented by this arrow here.
Basically this is a force which is non-central due to the equatorial bulge.
Now obviously we have a torque on that orbit, the torque is equal to <i>r x F</i>.
And if you look at the direction, you bring <i>r</i> towards <i>F</i>,
<i>vectorial r</i> towards <i>F</i> in the shortest path and this will give you the deviation of the <i>Ï‰</i> vector of the rotation vector of the orbit which is inside the screen, to a certain degree.
So this means that this is the ascending node here, and if <i>Ï‰</i> is getting into the plate, this means that we are going to have a drift of the ascending node to the west.
You have the <i>Î©</i> here, this is the <i>x</i> direction, and dÎ© / dt is going to be negative a drift of the ascending node over the line of nodes to the west.
If you have an inclination here, this is the inclination less than 90 degrees.
If you do the same calculation for a value of <i>i</i> more than 90 degrees then you find a drift of the ascending node to the east.
Obviously, if you have a perfectly equatorial orbit, the line of nodes is not existing so in this case, you don't have a nodal regression or progression.
And if you have a pure polar orbit, inclination 90 degrees, in this case you don't have a torque on the orbit either, so no nodal progression or regression.
Now you can calculate the value of <i>dÎ© / dt</i>, the drifts of the line of nodes as a function of the inclination of the orbits, the semi-major axis of the orbit and the eccentricity.
Let's take for now eccentricity 0 so we only have circular orbits, so obviously we have the inclination that comes into play and the semi-major axis.
With the power 3.5, the denominator, obviously the larger the orbit the less the nodal progression or regression, that's obvious, because if you are very far away from the Earth, whether there's an equatorial bulge or not it doesn't matter, it's just a point very far away with a certain mass.
Now you have the influence of the inclination with a cosine of <i>i</i>.
It means that the dÎ© / dt will become smaller and smaller as you go towards a polar orbit.
Now we have a plot of the nodal regression rates and degrees per day so it's dÎ© / dt as a function of their orbital inclinaiton.
So you basically have the cosine shape of that dÎ© / dt versus inclination and you have the symmetry because you have the cosine of <i>i</i>, you have the values of inclination going from 0 to 90 degrees then from 90 degrees to 180 degrees, and obviously you have a symmetry.
What you also see here very clearly is the influence of the altitude, and the upper line is for a low orbit of 200 km above the Earth's surface, the lower line for 5000.
Obviously, the higher you are the less the nodal regression for a given inclination.
Now we have seen that we have nodal regression for inclination less than 90 degrees which means that the dÎ© / dt will be negative and you have a nodal progression with dÎ© / dt positive for inclination more than 90 degrees.
Now, we can use this nodal progression for orbits of a little more than 90 degree inclination to reach the so-called
<i>Sun-synchrynous</i> condition.
Sun-synchronous condition means the following: the orbit will keep the same orientation versus the Sun as the Earth is going around the Sun in a full year, a little more than 365 days.
Let's look at the initial condition here.
Here we have an orbit which is seen exactly edge-on orbit which has the Sun in its plane, and as the Earth is going around the Sun in this direction, counter-clockwise, if we want that orbit to always keep the same orientation versus the Sun, it means that the line of nodes will have to drift to the east with about one degree per day, more precisely it has to be 0.9856 degrees per day in order to keep that Sun-synchronous condition.
Now, we have represented an orbit, a peculiar orbit with the Sun contained in the plane of the orbit, of course it can be for any other orbit.
If we want this orbit to keep the same orientation versus the Sun, as the Earth goes around the Sun in one year, then we need to have the nodal progression of about one degree per day, or more precisely the value indicated here
Now we have seen that in order to have
Sun-sychronous condition, we need to have a certain combination of the inclination and the distance.
We of course only consider circular orbits, so we are interested in the radius <i>r</i> and the inclination.
More precisely we have here a plot of the orbital altitude above the Earth's surface, versus inclination in order to have 
Sun-synchronous conditions.
And again, in order to have a positive dÎ© / dt, a drift line of nodes to the east we need to have an orbit a little more than 90 degrees inclination.
Typically it's between 95 and about 105 degrees inclination depending on the altitude.
