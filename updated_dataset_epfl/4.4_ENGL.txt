00:00:05,202 --> 00:00:07,692
How to characterize
planetary atmospheres ?

2
00:00:07,877 --> 00:00:10,839
They can be either very
thin such as the one of  Mars shown here

3
00:00:10,859 --> 00:00:14,322
or extremely dense, which the case of 
gaseous planets

4
00:00:14,322 --> 00:00:15,947
such as Jupiter or Saturn.

5
00:00:16,147 --> 00:00:19,122
Why can some planets 
retain their atmosphere

6
00:00:19,122 --> 00:00:21,405
while others cannot ?

7
00:00:21,535 --> 00:00:23,441
In this video we will explore

8
00:00:23,441 --> 00:00:25,565
some answers to these questions.

9
00:00:26,345 --> 00:00:28,661
Among the tools we 
have access to

10
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:30,914
to characterize 
planetary atmospheres

11
00:00:30,932 --> 00:00:33,929
is the hydrostatic equilibrium
equation.

12
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:37,963
As the name suggests, it
expresses an equilibrium

13
00:00:37,963 --> 00:00:43,210
between the gas pressure
acting in this direction and

14
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:48,095
the gravitational force
acting in the opposite direction.

15
00:00:48,135 --> 00:00:52,702
We represent these 2 forces
acting on a volume element,

16
00:00:52,702 --> 00:00:54,126
We represent these 2 forces
acting on a volume element,

17
00:00:54,126 --> 00:00:56,730
and we will see how to
use this equation,

18
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,256
how to establish the equation
of hydrostatic equilibrium

19
00:00:59,296 --> 00:01:03,693
which measures the equilibrium
between an infinitesimal pressure

20
00:01:04,063 --> 00:01:07,194
and an infinitesimal 
gravitational force.

21
00:01:07,674 --> 00:01:09,863
We have drawn here 
a volume element

22
00:01:09,863 --> 00:01:12,275
with an area <i>dA</i>

23
00:01:12,675 --> 00:01:16,650
and a height <i>dh</i>.

24
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,162
The mass density is <i>ρ</i>

25
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:23,225
and this small 
volume element is

26
00:01:23,225 --> 00:01:25,450
at a given altitude <i>h</i>.

27
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,495
<i>h</i> is the altitude in what follows.

28
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:32,482
There is here an 
infinitesimal pressure,

29
00:01:32,482 --> 00:01:34,582
the force of which is <i>dP · dA</i>.

30
00:01:34,962 --> 00:01:39,183
If we are interested in the pressure
exerted on our infinitesimal volume,

31
00:01:39,583 --> 00:01:41,795
we write it as <i>dP · dA</i>.

32
00:01:41,795 --> 00:01:46,311
Since we seek the equation
of hydrostatic equilibrium,

33
00:01:46,311 --> 00:01:49,773
this must be equal to <i>- dF_g</i>

34
00:01:49,773 --> 00:01:53,385
which is the gravitational force
exerted on this infinitesimal volume.

35
00:01:53,385 --> 00:01:57,989
The gravitational force is of course
the mass of the volume element,

36
00:01:57,989 --> 00:02:00,527
that is the density, which
depends on the altitude,

37
00:02:00,997 --> 00:02:04,628
times the gravitational field which
can also depend on the altitude,

38
00:02:05,618 --> 00:02:10,898
times the volume of our small
cylinder : <i>dA · dh</i>.

39
00:02:10,898 --> 00:02:13,772
We see that <i>dA</i> vanishes

40
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:16,913
and we can then rewrite
this equation in this form :

41
00:02:16,913 --> 00:02:24,626
<i>dP/dh</i> = - <i>ρ(h) .g(h)</i>

42
00:02:25,241 --> 00:02:27,253
Depending on the conditions
in which we use this equation,

43
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:30,544
we can very often
assume that

44
00:02:31,204 --> 00:02:34,496
<i>ρ(h)</i> is a constant, <i>ρ</i>.

45
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:39,071
Moreover, if we have a big planet
with a relatively thin atmosphere

46
00:02:39,071 --> 00:02:43,139
<i>g</i> is almost
independent of the altitude.

47
00:02:43,689 --> 00:02:48,024
We can therefore assume 
<i>g(h)</i>  to be a constant <i>g</i>.

48
00:02:48,024 --> 00:02:52,689
Thus, <i>ρ</i>, <i>g</i>, or both
of them can be constants.

49
00:02:55,249 --> 00:02:57,591
Let us rewrite the equation
of hydrostatic equilibrium

50
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:59,191
that we have just seen.

51
00:02:59,191 --> 00:03:01,873
We had : 
<i>dP / dh  =  - ρ g</i>.

52
00:03:02,463 --> 00:03:05,535
We had : 
<i>dP / dh  =  - ρ g</i>.

53
00:03:06,165 --> 00:03:08,439
Let us solve this equation.

54
00:03:08,439 --> 00:03:10,908
We recall the ideal gas law

55
00:03:15,638 --> 00:03:19,669
which tells us that <i>P = nkT</i>

56
00:03:19,669 --> 00:03:22,251
with <i>T</i> the temperature,
<i>k</i> the Boltzmann constant

57
00:03:22,251 --> 00:03:25,325
and <i>n</i> the numerical
density of particles.

58
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,515
This numerical density

59
00:03:29,515 --> 00:03:35,483
is the mass density over the
mean mass of a particle.

60
00:03:36,423 --> 00:03:40,262
We have thus here <i>μ</i>,
the mean molecular mass,

61
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:47,720
the computation of which
we will show later,

62
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:51,639
and <i>m_u</i> is the
atomic mass unit.

63
00:04:02,349 --> 00:04:04,716
Thanks to the ideal gas law,

64
00:04:04,716 --> 00:04:07,739
we get an expression for <i>ρ</i>.

65
00:04:13,369 --> 00:04:19,161
By rearranging the terms, we have that
<i>ρ = P μ m_u  /  kT</i>

66
00:04:19,221 --> 00:04:25,145
By rearranging the terms, we have that
<i>ρ = P μ m_u  /  kT</i>

67
00:04:25,555 --> 00:04:28,579
which I plug in the equation of
hydrostatic equilibrium

68
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:33,316
to get that <i>dP</i>, not any more
over <i>dh</i> but over <i>P</i>,

69
00:04:33,786 --> 00:04:36,521
is equal to, by rearranging the terms

70
00:04:36,631 --> 00:04:41,873
<i>- g μ m_u  /  kT</i> times dh

71
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:47,515
<i>- g μ m_u  /  kT</i> times dh

72
00:04:47,515 --> 00:04:50,168
We have on the left hand side
a dimensionless quantity

73
00:04:50,168 --> 00:04:53,458
so the right hand side must
also be dimensionless.

74
00:04:55,008 --> 00:04:58,527
Therefore the dimension of this
term is the inverse of a length.

75
00:05:05,307 --> 00:05:08,594
Let us rewrite once again the
equation of hydrostatic equilibrium

76
00:05:08,594 --> 00:05:11,480
in a slightly different manner.

77
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,871
We still have <i>dP / P</i>

78
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:19,362
and the term <i>dh</i>
we had previously.

79
00:05:19,492 --> 00:05:22,415
We had a term which was the
inverse of a length here, 

80
00:05:22,415 --> 00:05:23,663
so we write <i>1 / H</i>

81
00:05:25,423 --> 00:05:30,391
with <i>H = kT / g μ m_u</i>.

82
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:35,059
with <i>H = kT / g μ m_u</i>.

83
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,088
This equation is now very easy to solve.

84
00:05:40,578 --> 00:05:43,799
The pressure is a constant times

85
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:48,508
the exponential of <i> -h / H </i>.

86
00:05:48,508 --> 00:05:53,285
<i>H</i> is the characteristic
height of the atmosphere.

87
00:05:54,505 --> 00:05:56,582
<i>H</i> is the characteristic
height of the atmosphere.

88
00:05:59,572 --> 00:06:02,809
At ground level, when <i>h = 0</i>,

89
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:05,254
<i>P</i> is the ground pressure.

90
00:06:05,254 --> 00:06:09,276
We have thus simply that <i>P</i>
 is equal to <i>P_0</i>, the ground pressure,

91
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:13,344
times the exponential of <i> - h / H</i>.

92
00:06:14,744 --> 00:06:20,297
Let us draw this relation
on a figure.

93
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:27,659
We can plot either
the altitude as a function

94
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:28,743
of the pressure, or 
the other way around.

95
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:32,490
We have here the altitude <i>h</i>

96
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:35,622
and here is <i>P</i>. We are
thus drawing the pressure profile.

97
00:06:35,622 --> 00:06:38,305
The pressure profile
is an exponential curve

98
00:06:38,305 --> 00:06:41,570
which looks roughly like this.

99
00:06:43,013 --> 00:06:44,931
Here is the zero altitude 

100
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,854
so the pressure at this point is <i>P_0</i>.

101
00:06:48,934 --> 00:06:54,309
At this point, where <i>h = H</i>,

102
00:06:56,649 --> 00:07:02,936
the pressure is <i>P_0 / e</i>.

103
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:05,870
Again, we are here
at ground level

104
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:07,475
and here at high altitude.

105
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:10,546
This of course assumes that
we have solved this equation

106
00:07:10,546 --> 00:07:12,648
in an extremely simple case.

107
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:17,176
A word on the computation
of the mean molecular mass,

108
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:23,377
which we noted as a mean <i>μ</i>.

109
00:07:23,797 --> 00:07:27,093
Let us make the computation
with the Earth as an example.

110
00:07:28,103 --> 00:07:30,904
It represents the mean number
of particles in the atmosphere.

111
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:33,319
We simplify the Earth's atmosphere

112
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,908
by assuming that there is
78% of molecular nitrogen

113
00:07:39,038 --> 00:07:43,818
and 22% of molecular oxygen. 

114
00:07:45,118 --> 00:07:46,992
What we want to do is

115
00:07:46,992 --> 00:07:50,430
to count the mean number
of particles in the atmosphere.

116
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:56,548
The molecular nitrogen is <i>N2</i>,
the molecular oxygen is <i>O2</i>.

117
00:07:57,068 --> 00:07:59,482
The nitrogen atom has
7 protons and 7 neutrons

118
00:07:59,482 --> 00:08:01,390
therefore 14 nucleons. 

119
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,862
14 nucleons for 1 nitrogen atom

120
00:08:05,862 --> 00:08:08,060
means that for the molecule <i>N2</i>

121
00:08:09,450 --> 00:08:12,508
we have 28 atomic mass units.

122
00:08:13,188 --> 00:08:16,817
The oxygen atom
has 16 nucleons

123
00:08:18,587 --> 00:08:23,690
and thus for <i>O2</i> we
have 32 atomic mass units.

124
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:29,221
What is the mean molecular mass?

125
00:08:29,221 --> 00:08:31,310
It is a weighted mean mass.

126
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,605
The weights are simply the
proportion of each element

127
00:08:35,605 --> 00:08:37,477
in the atmosphere.

128
00:08:37,477 --> 00:08:41,981
We have 78% times
28 atomic mass unit

129
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:45,800
plus 22% times 32 atomic mass unit

130
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:50,646
which we normalize to 0.78 + 0.22

131
00:08:51,046 --> 00:08:55,205
and we find 29 atomic mass unit.

132
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:59,926
Once we have <i>g</i>, <i>ρ</i> and <i>H</i>,

133
00:08:59,966 --> 00:09:02,170
how can we use this quantity

134
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:06,606
to see for example if a planet is
able to retain its atmosphere or not?

135
00:09:06,606 --> 00:09:12,087
We can consider the escape
velocity of a molecule.

136
00:09:12,447 --> 00:09:14,405
We can compare

137
00:09:16,725 --> 00:09:19,313
the escape velocity of
a molecule in the atmosphere

138
00:09:19,313 --> 00:09:22,391
with its most probable velocity.

139
00:09:28,451 --> 00:09:31,708
If a particle has a very
large ejection speed,

140
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,809
it can break away from

141
00:09:35,809 --> 00:09:38,139
the gravitational attraction
of the planet

142
00:09:38,139 --> 00:09:40,511
and as such the planet does
not retain its atmosphere.

143
00:09:40,511 --> 00:09:43,717
Therefore we want to compare
the escape velocity of the molecules

144
00:09:43,717 --> 00:09:47,639
with the most probable velocity
of the molecules in the atmosphere.

145
00:09:51,619 --> 00:09:55,575
We write the escape velocity <i>v_e</i>
and it is greater than

146
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,626
the mean velocity of the molecules.

147
00:09:59,946 --> 00:10:01,916
<i>v_e</i> is the escape velocity

148
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:04,494
which is obtained by
computing the kinetic energy

149
00:10:04,494 --> 00:10:08,395
of a particle with a mass <i>m</i>
and the escape velocity

150
00:10:08,395 --> 00:10:13,339
and equalling this kinetic energy
to the potential energy of the particle

151
00:10:13,339 --> 00:10:15,650
in a gravitational field  <i>g</i>

152
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,035
where  <i>R</i> is the planetary radius

153
00:10:21,035 --> 00:10:23,810
since we consider the altitude zero.

154
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,545
This relation yields immediately 
the escape velocity, i.e.,

155
00:10:30,425 --> 00:10:32,946
the square root of 2  <i>g</i>
times the radius of the planet.

156
00:10:34,066 --> 00:10:36,324
We have on the one hand
the escape velocity

157
00:10:36,814 --> 00:10:39,480
and on the other hand
the most probable velocity.

158
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,062
We have a gas with
thermal agitation.

159
00:10:42,372 --> 00:10:46,748
As such, the velocity distribution
is a Boltzmann distribution

160
00:10:48,238 --> 00:10:49,855
just like in thermodynamics

161
00:10:49,855 --> 00:10:52,861
and the most probable mean velocity

162
00:10:54,211 --> 00:10:57,257
is the Gaussian mean of
the velocity distribution,

163
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:02,445
which is equal to the
squared root of <i>2 k T</i>,

164
00:11:02,445 --> 00:11:04,553
where <i>k</i> is still the Boltzmann constant,

165
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:07,843
over <i>µ m_u </i>.

166
00:11:08,613 --> 00:11:11,558
Here is where the <i>H</i> we
previously saw appears.

167
00:11:11,558 --> 00:11:14,771
We can rewrite this mean velocity as

168
00:11:14,771 --> 00:11:19,076
the square root of <i>2 g H</i>, where 
<i>H</i> is the characteristic height

169
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:20,569
we previously computed.

170
00:11:21,029 --> 00:11:23,939
The relation we wrote,

171
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:29,157
so, <i>V_e</i>  > and the mean <i>V_m</i>,

172
00:11:29,697 --> 00:11:34,099
can be finally written as a comparison

173
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:38,187
between the planetary radius and the
characteristic height of the atmosphere.

174
00:11:38,857 --> 00:11:42,781
In such a case, if <i>R_p</i> > <i>H</i>

175
00:11:42,781 --> 00:11:47,305
the planet can keep its atmosphere.

176
00:11:55,635 --> 00:11:58,021
We have thus established
a very simple relation

177
00:11:58,661 --> 00:12:01,347
from the characteristic
height of a planet

178
00:12:01,347 --> 00:12:04,340
that tells, by simply comparing
the planetary radius with

179
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,555
the characteristic height
of the atmosphere,

180
00:12:06,555 --> 00:12:09,697
if a planet can retain its
atmosphere or not.

181
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:12,673
Here is the data from
the previous video

182
00:12:12,673 --> 00:12:14,539
for Venus, the Earth and Mars

183
00:12:14,539 --> 00:12:17,554
with the addition of the new
quantities we just introduced :

184
00:12:17,554 --> 00:12:22,496
the pressure at ground level,
the characteristic height <i>H</i>

185
00:12:22,496 --> 00:12:24,356
and the radius of the planets.

186
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:27,515
We first notice that
in the 3 cases

187
00:12:27,555 --> 00:12:29,500
the planet retains its atmosphere

188
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,651
since <i>H</i> is negligible in
regards to the planetary radius.

189
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:37,193
De facto, the 3 planets, the Earth, Venus
and Mars have indeed an atmosphere.

190
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:40,725
In the second place we
notice extreme differences

191
00:12:40,725 --> 00:12:42,976
between the surface pressures

192
00:12:42,976 --> 00:12:45,994
although the 3 planets
are otherwise very similar

193
00:12:45,994 --> 00:12:49,438
and they moreover have
comparable black body temperatures.

194
00:12:49,868 --> 00:12:54,682
This shows once again that the
composition of the atmospheres

195
00:12:54,682 --> 00:12:57,617
and their ability to
interact with radiation

196
00:12:58,007 --> 00:13:01,642
completely determines the
physics at the surface of a planet

197
00:13:01,642 --> 00:13:06,367
as well as the complete
temperature and pressure profiles

198
00:13:06,367 --> 00:13:08,681
of the atmospheres with the altitude.
