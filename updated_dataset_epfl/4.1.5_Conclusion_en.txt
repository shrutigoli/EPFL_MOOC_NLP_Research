So, thank you very much for being with me in this part.
I hope that you really understood sort of speak, the essence of what is the level that we're trying to understand the brain, e.g. is very important because it records electrical activity, globally; and other means to record globally activity
FMRI, EG, and other methods are essential to understand the global activity of the brain, but we need to understand the local activity of the brain in terms of electrical activity and we know now, through this course that it is generated by the intrinsic properties of neurons.
These ion channels that are distributed in the axons and are sensitive to voltage could generate this wonderful all or none propagating phenomena: the spike.
These synaptic receptors that catch up this transmitter can generate locally the EPSPs, this other signal and these two signals interact together to generate this richness of the electrical activity in the brain and this richness, especially in the human brain gives rise to the richness of what we do, also, our capability due to its richness to understand ourselves to develop mathematical models of the signals and maybe repair the brain, after such an understanding.
That's the role of the scientist, and I very much hope that now you would think about the brain sometimes as generating two types of signals: synaptic potential, action potential and that these signals stand really in the basis, in the core, of who we are
Thank you very much for listening.
