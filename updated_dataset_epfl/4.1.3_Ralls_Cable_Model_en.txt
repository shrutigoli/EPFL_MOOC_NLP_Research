Okay, so we are now into trying to understand the flow of electrical current of synaptic current in dendrites.
This understanding came from a very, very beautiful work by Wilfred Rall
So, Rall in the late 50s developed what he called
"The one dimensional passive cable equationâ€� to describe the flow of synaptic current generated locally let's say on the dendritic spine, into the dendrite into the rest of the tree, including the soma and axon
So, what is the idea between cable equation,
Rall's cable equation?
The idea here, that here you have a cable which is supposed to describe a piece of dendrite.
It's one dimensional cable because we only look at axial current
So, you only look at this direction of flow or this direction of flow in the X direction but not in the Y or the Z direction of this cube, of this dendritic cube.
So this is a cable that describes the axon this is the dendrite, this is the membrane here and this is the axial resistivity inside the dendrite.
And the idea is very simple but the equation that becomes is a description of this simple idea is that if you have an axial current flowing inside the dendrite some of it will leak out from the membrane and some, after leaking out, will continue axially longitudinally, to other region of the cable
So, you're going to have an axial current and then a loss through the membrane and the rest is continuing to flow axially. Ok?
This is in the case of passive membrane, so you only lose...
You inject a current in some location let's say you inject a current in some location any location you may inject a current. Ok?
You injected the current here
The synapse injected the current here as if there is an inward current flowing here.
This inward current starts to flow axially some of it is being lost to the membrane through the membrane ion channels the passive ion channels, they are open
Some of the current goes outside, the rest go here some of it being lost here
So, less current is flowing here and so they will get a decay of the current less and less current will reach less and less distance.
So, if you write exactly what I spoke now, in words, in equation you will see this cable equation here
Which is actually showing you in some sense that the axial current splits into either a membrane current, and we know the description of the membrane current because there is capacitance and there is resistance and we can describe the membrane potential due to this loss of current through the membrane, and the rest of the current flow axially; and this is really this differential equation
It has space here, X, which is the axial current
And it has time here which reflects the capacitance of the membrane and together you get this cable equation which really describes the loss of current or the flow of current through an axial cable but with the loss through the membrane
That's the idea behind the cable equation, without going into the details
Rall wrote some very nice papers analytically to solve this cable equation,
I will just give you some intuitions.
Actually intuitions are the main thing that I'm doing now without going into too many practical details because this you will do in your exercises.
Let me give you some intuition.
Here is a cable, here is a dendritic cable so it's a branch dendrite.
You see the main trunk and then it branches to one branch and then it branches to another branch.
Suppose you inject some voltage at this location.
So, you inject current and there is some voltage here and you can see that through this cable because of what I just spoke about current loss you will get attenuation of the voltage to this branch point and then more attenuation to the dotted branches and so forth
So, that's how a synaptic potential will look in dendrite.
This is another example suppose you inject the current in this location you will get in the injection site the largest voltage but then it will attenuate very strongly to this direction, here, or to the right direction, there, and so you will get a big loss, a very steep attenuation in dendrite.
Rall showed that indeed in dendrites you may get locally large voltage, synaptic potential locally, maybe 20 millivolts locally, but this synaptic potential will attenuate very steeply because of the cable properties of the dendrite.
And we just saw that but we can also look at the time, what happens in time not only in space, but in time.
So, let's say that you inject your current here a transient current, very brief current like a synaptic current you inject and then the current decays locally.
Then, if you wait enough time you see that after some time the voltage reaches here at this location because the voltage spreads in time and then here, after some time it goes down it goes down, it goes down
And after some time it goes here and after enough time the current dissipates through the membrane and nothing is left and you are back to resting potential.
So of course in cable, because the cable equation as I said before, has both space and time, the solution for the cable equation now it's not ordinary differential equation but partial differential equation with X and T it will take both space for decay of voltage and also voltage will decay in time and that's the solution for the cable equation:
The time and space solution.
This is another example, so let's say that I inject here at some location X=0 inject a very strong current and I get a strong voltage and I'm looking at some distance
I will get this, let's say EPSP if I look later at a more distant, so this is distance this is close to the injection site further from the injection site, even further, you can see the attenuation both in time and in space.
One interesting thing is that you can see that the shape of the voltage in time let's call it the EPSP the shape of the EPSP changes as a function of distance from the injection site.
This will mean that the synaptic... the shape of the synaptic potential locally at the synaptic site will be different than the shape of the voltage... of the synaptic voltage away from the synapse let's say the cell body
It will actually attenuate, but also will become broader
It will be smeared out, like you see here from something that is sharper, to something that is more smeared out, that is what is expected from cable theory
Rall's cable theory, for synapses.
You can speak about the velocity how fast the EPSP or the IPSP propagates from the site of origin in the dendrite to another location
So, this shows you here, the velocity.
We didn't discuss this much but the velocity first is very fast and then it comes to kind of a steady state velocity of the EPSP so this is just to give you a ball park this could be something on the order of say 0.1 meter per second
Something like that, or even less, so the synaptic potential from its origin in the synapse itself in the spine, let's say until the soma it will take some time, there will be a delay, as you can see here.
It happens here, let's say it takes some time to reach here it takes even more time to reach here so there is a propagation delay, there is a dendritic delay between the origin of the synapse until the voltage is seen in the soma.
This is an important aspect, because neurons delay the signals, it's not instantaneous it's actually quite a slow process of a few milliseconds or tenth of milliseconds from the synapse to the soma depending on where the synapse is, relative to the soma.
So, this is a demonstration that Rall already early on, in '67, already showed something important.
This is his model of a neuron, this is the cell body and this is the distal dendrite, this is firing the dendrite.
So he split the dendritic tree here into let's say a chain of compartment number two, number three, number four, and this is very far in the dendrite, and this is very close to the soma.
And he was injecting simulated synapses to the soma to the proximal compartment to the more distal, to the more distal, and looking at the shape of the synaptic potential at the soma as a function of location.
When you normalize this somatic EPSPs you see that if you inject your synapse into compartment number one you get a very fast, local EPSP
If you inject it at compartment number eight, in here it's this case and you normalize for the amplitude because of course it should have been decayed but if you normalize there you see that it takes time for the synapse synaptic potential to reach the soma so it's slower but it also broader and now the EPSP is very broad.
So, Rall was actually the first one to understand that the shape of the synaptic potential as measured at the soma reflects in many way the origin of the synapse if it's a very brief EPSP it probably comes from dendritic region near to the soma
If it's a very sluggish EPSP, and broad it comes probably from a distal region so this is a distal synapse.
And because we know that the dendritic tree is full of synapses some are distal, some are in the middle some proximal to the soma and axon we know that the shape of this EPSP is changed, as a function of the origin, at the soma and also the amplitude changes; and in may ways, the nearby synapses excitatory synapses are more effective in de-polarizing the cell, if it's an EPSP than the distal synapses, which attenuate it.
So, Rall cable equations enable us to understand what is the degree of attenuation, how much a distal synapse will de-polarize the cell body, how much the same synapse, if it would have been proximal affect the cell body and so on.
So, the cable equation is really an essential part of understanding how the neuron collects its inputs and then attenuates these inputs from the synapses to the cell body and axon, where the second signal, the spike, is generated.
Now, in order to solve the cable equations, in some cases you can do it analytically as Rall did and really get a mathematical, clean solution for current injection in this location or another location and the voltage that emerges in any other location of the tree, but typically, especially for conductant changes which is perturbing the membrane properties by opening ion channels it's hard to solve analytically and for this you use what we always now use in all our simulation which is called the compartmental modeling.
So, compartmental modeling is a numerical implication or application of the cable equation so the cable equation is an analytical equation the compartment modeling of the cable equation is a numerical approximation of the continuous analytical case.
So, the compartmental modeling is a numerical simulation of the Rall cable equation.
And the idea is very simple.
So, let's say that you have a reconstructed dendritic tree and that you know all the electrical parameter of this dendritic tree: you know the resistance of the soma you know the capacitance of the soma you know the resistance of the axial intracellular resistivity and all that...
Let's say that you have all these properties, so you have ,the cable equation for this one but let's say that now you want to inject the synapse conductance change here and another, let's say inhibitory synapse so this is inhibitory here, and excitatory there and another synapse here, and so on...
So, you really want now to perturb your model neuron in order to understand how all these inputs integrate and generate eventually local voltages but also axonal voltages.
So, you take the continuous case which is, as I said, determined by the cable equation and you cut it into segments, or compartments, here is one compartment, so, you disquieterize, you take the continuous case and you take a delta X and you decide this I call a compartment this I call another compartment
So this is one
Delta X disquietization another Delta X disquietization another Delta X
And for this disquieterized compartments with this Delta X supposed to be small enough so that the numerical solution after this disquietization will approximate the continuous case, then, you get the compartmental representation of the cable case so this is now one compartment this is now another compartment and so on and you can see that the idea here is that to describe each compartment by the membrane so there is a capacitance and there is a resistance here so, this is the membrane representation here the resistance, and a capacitance of the membrane and there is this axial resistivity which connects one compartment to the other compartment: that's what you see here.
So compartmental modeling, and you will be using that a lot for example, simulated by neuron which is a simulator that is using compartmental modeling approach to model neurons and network of neurons bombarded by synapses, and then, of course, because we know how to model a synapse let's say this synapse, I know how to edit to compartmental modeling another segment that will describe this particular synapse with its battery as we just discussed.
So, that's the compartmental representation of the cable equation, but the underlying theory mathematical theory for current flow in passive dendrites including synapses, today we can extend it even to dendrites that have some voltage dependence membrane properties but we are not going to talk about this, but the principle is that you take the equation, which is continuous and you take a discrete set of equations one for each compartment you connect it together in a big matrix of connectivity and you solve this matrix numerically; each matrix represents a piece of a membrane a little segment, a little compartment plus the ions that runs there, it could be synaptic or in the case of axon, it could be excitable channels, we can do all this by simulation, like Hodgkin actually simulated the axon using compartmental modeling already there, this is a much sophisticated way to do it today using the cable equations and including synapses non-linear excitable channels or anything you want for the membrane.
We have this capability, and we have this online free software to implement this compartmental numerical modeling of neurons
So, for example, you can study what is the local effect of a synapse using this simulation approach.
For example, if your synapse so if your G-synapse was located distally and this would be an excitatory synapse so excitatory post synaptic potential (EPSP) locally you will see that this is a very, very localized spread because of this big attenuation of the synapse the synapse will affect only very locally the dendritic tree and a very, very small amount of the charge of the current injected by the synapse will reach the cell body.
So, as I mentioned before this region can have a big de-polarization of let's say 10 millivolts and the cell body will get something extremely small maybe 0.5 millivolts
So, the EPSP will attenuate severely
And this means that you cannot use one EPSP, typically, to reach threshold for spike varying at the axon.
You need many EPSPs if you put your synapse here it will be very locally affecting other local synapses integrating together, generating local de-polarization if these are EPSPs but the big effect will be local and then it will spread and attenuate distally.
These are the only synapses that work.
If the synapse is directed to the soma, like here then of course, at the soma you will get a bigger EPSP
Then, if this same synapse would have been distally so this is the type of thing you can do today, easily, using neuron simulation or other simulations in a compartmental modeling of this reconstructed dendritic tree.
Ok, so I think we came to a summary of how to model synaptic potentials and how to look at it, in some sense, integratively.
Ok, so I mentioned that locally you have rather large sometimes synaptic potentials both excitatory as well as inhibitory
But not in the same synapse, or some synapse generate EPSPs some other synapses IPSP, the same dendrite.
And the fact that you have cable cause these dendrites or synapses to attenuate from the site of origin to other regions, not only to the soma, so, this synapse may affect other regions but it attenuates very steeply, each synapse attenuate very steeply because of the cable properties of the dendrites.
This means, as I said, that locally let's say an EPSP could be on the spine head where it's initiated 20, 30 millivolts, but you will see very small perturbation small EPSP very attenuated but also smeared out broad at the soma, maybe half a millivolt, maybe less
That means that you need on the order of maybe 100 or more excitatory synapses to converge into the dendritic tree within a given time window in order for them to summate some on top of each other together, to reach threshold for spike firing.
Maybe 100 synapses, each one contributes half a millivolt a third of a millivolt at the soma, this should ride on top of the other they should sum up with each other in order to reach threshold for spike firing.
If they don't, then there will be no spike.
If there is enough excitatory synapses but at the same time you will get a lot of inhibitory synapses then the inhibitory synapses will tend to dampen the excitatory synapses because they have negative signal and also because they shunt the membrane their open conductances
So the excitatory current cannot reach the soma because it is shunted by the inhibition so this inhibitory effect is very critical.
So actually, the brain in general and in particular neurons are very much dependent on this balance between excitation and inhibition.
You should imagine a lot of excitatory coming let's say in the pyramidal cell you have 8,000 excitatory synapses bombarding the tree but there are also 2,000 inhibitory synapses  or 1,500 that tend to dampen the excitation, and to shunt, to avoid this excitation, and whether there will be spike or not really depends on this balance between how much excitatory charge reaches the soma and how much inhibitory charge dampens the current from not reaching the soma.
The end result, the sum of all this charge of many, many synapses out of 10,000 will determine whether you will get one spike, two spikes a train of spikes, a music of spikes tatata, stop, tatata and so forth, this will be determined critically.
But how much charge arrives to the soma positive and negative, whether it reaches threshold or much above threshold, or almost threshold, whether one spike, two or three and also of course the pattern of activity as I showed you early will depend on the property of the excitable channels in the axonal membrane.
Some axon will like by themselves to fire with burst some will like to fire repetitively, so it's the charge that arrives, plus the properties of the axon that will eventually determine the particular music that this neuron is now playing.
Whether it's tatata stop, stop, stop, tatata
Whether tatatatata and so forth...
And this is underlying the neuronal code so it's extremely important to understand how synapses converge, interact, integrate in the dendrite reaching the soma, axon, and what type of axon property, axonal property, excitable properties, how do the axon interpret these charge whether by a burst or not.
When something goes wrong when you have imbalance between excitation, inhibition let's say in the case of epileptic seizure then the whole brain goes wild: too much excitation.
If there is too much inhibition then the brain is too quiet: no activity.
And so, the balance is critical but also the type of activity within this network is probably standing as an essence of the type of behavior the state of the brain whether you are going to be a deep sleep, REM sleep, no sleep, whether you will have difficulties in sleep, whether you will be happy or sad.
All these activities that emerge from the synapse and output axons is really something that we must understand both in health and disease.
Lastly, but I'm not going to talk about this today these synapses that I mentioned are a wonderful source of changes in the brain, underlying memory, learning and memory because I told you that these synapses may change their efficacy: because they are analogue signals they may become stronger or weaker as a function of some activity we understand only little about this plasticity rules, but the plasticity is within the synapses so, they preserve the memory and when they become stronger or weaker when they form new synapses between neurons you form new capability for a circuit to be active in a particular way, generates its own particular new music which will stand for your new learning: the letter A, a new face, a new feeling, a new idea.
We must understand synapses, spikes and network activity in order to understand a state but we also must understand plasticity in the synapses in order to understand the emergence of new states, new creative states, hopefully, and that's exactly what we are trying to understand in neuroscience: both the activity, the computation, or the coding that this activity stands for, and also the plasticity and learning all embedded in this electrical, chemical activity of this miraculous brain.
