Can enlarging highways allow to remove the traffic jams?
This is Vincent Kaufmann EPFL that answers us for the energy-environment platform today.
Take a highway connecting two cities randomly the one linking Lausanne and Geneva, in Switzerland, two tracks on each side, and over the years the population has increased the car has been democratized, the highway was clogged.
Building a third way could actually improve traffic flow.
It's simple physics but not necessarily in the long run.
Various experiments have been conducted worldwide.
Take London.
The N25, called the "London Orbital", is a highway which is practically all around the British capital.
This new track was built between 1975 and 1986 to improve traffic flow.
Three years after the end of its construction it was already clogged.
Adding other channels did not help.
But why ?
First is the "pull factor" effect.
Whenever new channels are built new drivers, no longer taking the highway to move because of traffic jams thought they could take it again.
So there are more cars.
Then there is what is called "Zahavi's conjecture".
It's a theory that when a means of transport allows to go faster we tend to use it to go further rather than spending less time traveling.
This means that new infrastructures simply allow people to go live further, to live by example in the Jura and work no longer in NeuchÃ¢tel but in Freiburg.
Not to mention that today people are willing to spend more time in transport than before.
In Switzerland 20 years ago people traveled an average of 70 minutes a day today it is 85. So what now?
We understood, larger highways does not reduce the traffic jams but alternatives exist, that they please, or not.
Charge entrance into cities, and thus affect the wallets of road users or reduce speed on motorways to make it both more fluid and less attractive.
My grandmother said:
"If you want to blow the traffic jams, wait for the new year my dear!"
