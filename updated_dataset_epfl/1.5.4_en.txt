Let's talk now about radiation balance for a spacecraft close to planet Earth.
You see the spacecraft represented here, and obviously, the exchange of energy between other bodies in the Solar System and the background, the Universe of the celestial spheres, this exchange of energy only in the form of radiation.
Possibly some flux of particles, typically the solar wind, impact a certain energy to the spacecraft, but I would say, that 99.9% of the energy exchange is in the form of radiation.
Now, if we consider a spacecraft in the vicinity of the Earth, there are several sources of radiation, obviously, the dominant source is the radiation from the Sun.
Again, the direct solar flux, the solar constant, 1,368 W/m&sup2;.
This is totally dominant.
We mentioned already the albedo of the Earth, about 30% of the radiation of the Sun impacting the Earth is coming back towards space, typically, is what the spacecraft, if it is in the vicinity of the Earth.
We talked about the Earth infrared radiation with the two components that we mentioned; this is another source of radiation of the spacecraft.
Now there's another source, but it's a very rare and dim source; this is the background radiation from the sky which corresponds to a black body of about 2.6 Kelvin, which is of course, is very, very low intensity, or energy radiation.
But if you have a spacecraft in the vicinity of the Earth, obviously, the dominant source is the Sun.
Now, we have a situation of radiation balance.
The absorbed radiation by the spacecraft is going to be equal to the emitted radiation in a balanced situation.
When we talk about absorbed, we could have, possibly, in addition the self generated power by the electrical system generating heat, and the energy inside the spacecraft itself.
This has to be added to the absorbed radiation but all of this has to be emitted.
So <i>Pâ‚� </i> equal <i>Pâ‚‘</i>, balance of radiation is a fundamental feature in a spacecraft.
Now we had the Stefan-Boltzmann law which is giving the value of the emitted radiation per unit surface in the case of a black body, it's equal to sigma, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, times the power four of the temperature.
So this is a fundamental law, the Stefan-Boltzmann law,
<i>Pâ‚‘</i> equals sigma times <i>T^4</i>.
Let's talk about the radiation balance for our spacecraft.
Now, we will consider a spacecraft that is only illuminated by the Sun.
Again, this is a dominant radiation source on the spacecraft.
So <i>Pâ‚�</i> equals <i>Pâ‚‘</i>, and we don't have a black body so <i>Pâ‚�</i> is equal to the solar constant times the surface of the spacecraft which is exposed to the Sun, times a factor alpha, which is the solar absorptivity.
If we had a black body, then the alpha would be equal to one.
If we talk about the emitted radiation again, it's not a black body, so we have to introduce epsilon, which is the infrared emissivity times sigma <i>T^4</i>, this is the Stefan-Boltzmann law, times the total surface of the satellite or the spacecraft we are talking about.
Now, if we have <i>Pâ‚� </i> equals <i>Pâ‚‘</i>, obviously, if we know the geometrical characteristics of the spacecraft on one hand, and also the alpha, and the epsilon value for the surface of the spacecraft, we can see that we have the possibility to extract the value T, of the temperature of the spacecraft, or the average temperature of the spacecraft.
Now, again, we put <i>Pâ‚‘</i> equal <i>Pâ‚�</i>, and with the expression we had on the previous slide we can extract the temperature which, interestingly enough, is equal to alpha divided by epsilon to the power of 1/4.
So, the characteristics of the outside of the spacecraft in terms of emissivity and absorptivity will play a role in the average temperature of the spacecraft, times the other factor which is the solar constant, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, and the ratio between the surface of the spacecraft exposed to the solar radiation, divided by the total surface of the spacecraft.
Now, this expression for the temperature of the spacecraft is only valid if the radiation coming from the Sun is of course, only impacting the part of the spacecraft exposed to the Sun but still distributed over the whole spacecraft.
Typically, it's valid if we have a rotating spacecraft and not always the same surface exposed to the Sun.
Typically, this expression for <i>T</i> won't be valid for SOHO, because SOHO is always one part of the spacecraft constantly exposed to the Sun, that's where you have the cameras, the coronograph and all the detection system for the Sun radiation and of course, the other side of the spacecraft is always in the shadow.
So these expression for <i>T</i> of the spacecraft is an average value which is valid only for a rotating spacecraft, or a spacecraft for which the solar radiation impacting the spacecraft is distributed over the whole surface.
Here we have a table of the properties of materials with values that are of interest to determine the temperature of the spacecraft like we talked about before, where the solar absorption coefficient alpha, and the infrared emissivity epsilon are listed for various materials and noteworthy are gold, where you have the average absorption coefficient alpha, but you have a very low value of emissivity so the ratio of absorptivity to emissivity is going to be rather large, which means that the equilibrium temperature of the surface of gold exposed to the Sun is going to be very high.
And on the other end of the spectrum if I can say, you have a white epoxy, with the medium value of absorptivity, but a very high value of emissivity and for that reason, the ratio absorptivity divided by emissivity is very low, which means that you are going to have a low temperature.
So these are the two extremes of substances that you can use on the surface of a spacecraft, to get either a high temperature, in the case of gold, if you desire to have a high temperature, and low temperature you use white epoxy.
This is a kind of a summary of the spacecraft design strategies, a feature that you want to introduce in the spacecraft in order to be in a good situation in terms of the proper functioning of the spacecraft and a proper temperature also.
You want to have a conducting surface on the spacecraft.
You don't want to have electrical insulation between two parts of the spacecraft which are exposed outside because you may have differences in potentials, you could have discharges, which could be really damaging for the spacecraft.
So a conducting surface of the spacecraft to avoid local voltage deltas and possibly resulting electrical discharges.
We mentioned that you want to have hardening of electronic components so if you have increased solar particle flux typically following coronal ejections then you still want to have the electronic system in the spacecraft functioning properly, so you need a hardening, which is going to be covered in other courses.
And we just mentioned that the value of alpha divided by epsilon has to be chosen properly, in order to have a temperature of the surface of the spacecraft in the range of the desired, for a proper funtioning of this spacecraft.
