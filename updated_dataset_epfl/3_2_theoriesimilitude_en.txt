After this small warm-up quiz, we will enter in the heart of the subject and we will see more precisely what it is when talking about similarity.
To try to explain this notion of similarity,
I have chosen to illustrate this notion through a few examples relatively simple. First of all, we must describe what is the theory of similarity. It is a theory that is extremely useful to propose dimensionless numbers, we will see a couple of them : the Reynolds number, the Froude number, these are numbers with no dimensions that are used to characterize a flow, the theory of similarity is also used to simplify the equations, unfortunately, fluid mechanics are known to be particularly rotor and give equations to solve that are relatively complex.  The theory of similarity will simplify these equations.
This same theory is also used to reduce the complexity of a problem, for example when experimentally we are looking to study a phenomenon, we have a large number of parameters that reflect, or that are useful to describe the phenomenon, we will see, with the theory of similarity, that we can reduce by an adequate combination, the number of useful parameters. Finally, the theory of similarity establishes criteria of similarity between different scales, for example the experimental scale, on a reduced model and the life-size scale, the scale 1. It is something that is extremely useful, also in engineering. 
To understand what is going on, two examples, the first one, I will detail it again afterwards. We have here a impulsion wave that is created by the entering of a granular flow, here a rock flow, the wave is here a couple of meters high. We easily understand that it is extremely difficult to create such waves in the natural environment, however, at the scale of the laboratory it is relatively simple to do, we will see an example afterwards, by creating a granular avalanche on a inclined plane. This avalanche penetrates in a small lake, and will create a wave. The question that arises will be to know how we do to go from this experiment idealized in laboratory to the real case ? In engineering, we have similar problems, we have for example here what we call a torrential lava, a torrential flood mobilizing important volumes of mud, at Fully near Martigny in the Valais. We see here the torrent, we see here the mud effusions, and to study the protections against these torrential floods, a way to do is to proceed in laboratory on models, on reduced models. Here, the houses are simplified by bricks and we will use as a substitute of mud, a laboratory mud. We will then study in laboratory, at the reduced scale, the way in which the flow is produced, where the mud will overflow ? Which houses will be impacted
? I go back to my example of the impulsion wave.
Here, we have a granular avalanche where the grains are animated at a certain velocity u. These grains have a certain momentum at the entrance in the lake. We suppose initially that the water is at rest. We will have a transfer of momentum between the grains and the water at rest. This transfer of momentum, as well as the flux of mass will create a wave that will be animated at a certain velocity v and which will have a certain height that I have called here Î·. We can see here through the film what is happening, it is a filmed experiment with a camera at very high speed, here we are in slow-motion and we see the particles entering the lake, and starting to create a wave. The problem that arises is to know if experimentally, in laboratory I am capable of measuring this velocity, this height, how do I do to go from this representation in laboratory to the quantities that characterize the phenomenon at the natural scale so velocity of the impulsion wave and height.
To understand this notion of similarity, we will begin with things relatively simple that we see in geometry. The first notion is the notion of isomorphic transformation, for example, here I have a big triangle and this big triangle is similar to the small triangle, we will say that the big triangle, here, is similar geometrically if we have conservation of lengths, so if the ratio between a' and a, the ratio between b' and b, c' and c, all these ratios are equal and identical and are equal to Î», Î» will be what we call the ratio of similarity or scaling factor or also simply scale. In this case here, when we have a transformation where the lengths are transformed, where we have a ratio of length that will be identical whatever the axis, the x axis or the y axis, we will speak of isomorphic transformation. We can generalize this isomorphic transformation by introducing an linear transformation. 
For example, if I initially go from a circle that will have a radius a, that will be equal here to b and I stretch my circle differently along the x axis or along the y axis, I will obtain at the end an ellipse. The ratio of length between the semi major-axis a' over the radius will be equal to Î»x and the ratio between the semi minor-axis here b' over the initial radius b will be noted Î»y, in general for a linear transformation Î»x and Î»y will take different values.
This notion of linear transformation is extremely interesting as it allows us to introduce the notion of invariant. For example, if I consider the area of my circle and that I look at the area of the ellipse,
I see that if I introduce the ratio s which is the ratio between the area and the product of the semi major axis and of the semi minor axis, in the case of the circle it will simply be the radius square. This ratio between the area and the product of semi-axis, this ratio is conserved and equal to Pi, in this case here, we will say that this scalar quantity s is an invariant by linear transformation. However, if now I am interested to the perimeter of the ellipse and if I try to link the perimeter of the ellipse compared to the perimeter of the circle, I cannot show that there exists for example a ratio that will be constant, simply, if we look at the definition of the perimeter of the ellipse, we see that there exists two parameters and that these two parameters will be stretched with different values, so we will have something that will be much more complicated at the end. The under-lying question is to know why certain quantities are conserved and others are not ? And how do we do to know which quantities are conserved and which quantities are not conserved ? To answer this question, we introduce what we call a scaling law, which is a relation of proportionality between an object or variable which describes the object and the scale, here it would be a geometrical scale as we are in geometry.
In fluid mechanics after, we will introduce the scales of velocity, the scale of time... For example I take an object of an arbitrary shape and I introduce a characteristic scale, here it will be l, it could very well be an arbitrary dimension, l is only to give the order of magnitude of the object's dimension. The perimeter, for example. will be proportional to this characteristic length, also, dimensionally, the area will be something that will be proportional to this characteristic quantity raised to the power 2. If the object was an object that occupies a volume, the volume of this object here will be l^3. We see that in the case of the ellipse, the transformation of a circle to an ellipse is done along two directions, the x axis and the y axis, whereby the definition of the perimeter p' will inevitably involve these two length ratios. The quantity p' which is the perimeter of the ellipse linked to the perimeter of the circle is a quantity relatively complex that will be a function of these two aspect ratios, the aspect ratio along x and the aspect ratio along y. The theory of similarity will be a theory that will be extremely useful to specify the number of parameters needed to describe what is happening when we do a transformation but sometimes also give the structure, what is f equal to as a function of different parameters. Before entering more in the theory of similarity, we must come back on a few fundamental notions and especially on the notion of measure. All measures can be expressed as a function of 7 fundamental units, here I am in the metric system that is employed in most countries except the United States and the United Kingdom.
In mechanics essentially, we will use
3 fundamental units so relative to length, mass and time. These fundamental units are the meter, the kilogram and the second. In physics we will also need, for the electrical intensity the ampere, the kelvin for temperature, the candela  for the luminous intensity and the mole for the matter quantity.
Every measure is associated to a symbol of which the typography is fixed, for example, the Newton, that is written here without capital letter but its symbol has a capital letter and we can define the Newton with the fundamental units expressed here in kg/m/s so
1 newton is equal to 1 kg.m/s^2, the pressure will be expressed in pascal, still without capital letter, the symbol will be Pa and in the international system
1 pascal is equal to 1 kg.m^-1.s^-2, we can reproduce this for different measures that we will use during the course of fluid mechanics, for the velocity, the density, the acceleration, the area, the energy flux or the power. The question that often arises for tor student is to know how do
I do when I am working for example with watts or joules to find the fundamental units ? A small mnemotechnic device relatively simple is to remember the definition of the unit to be able to find the fundamental units.
For example, the work will be expressed in joules and so the work will be a force multiplied by a length. A force is in Newtons, multiplied here by a length, by meters.We have seen it previously but we could find it, a Newton is kg.m/s^2 so when I do the product of the fundamental units, I find that a joule is equal to 1 kg.m^2/s^2. So, we will introduce now the notion of dimensionless number, a dimensionless number is a number without dimension. We will see three particularly important, the first one is the Reynolds number that is defined as the ratio between the density Ï�, a characteristic velocity of the flow, a characteristic length and divided by the dynamic viscosity of the fluid. This Reynolds number is relatively important, especially because it is used to characterize the flow, especially to know if the flow is laminar, we will be at that point at small Reynolds number or if the flow is turbulent, at that point we will be at very high Reynolds number. These will be notion that we will see in chapter 6.
Note that we also introduce the kinematic viscosity that is defined as being the ratio between the dynamic viscosity Î¼ and the density Ï�f of the fluid. In this case here, the definition of the Reynolds number is the following, it is equal to the scale of velocity multiplied by the characteristic scale of length, divided by the kinematic viscosity.
The Stokes number is defined as the ratio between the relaxation time of a particle in a fluid, for example a particle that would be in sedimentation and the characteristic time of the fluid, so it is the time that will characterize the way which the fluid will adjust to the displacement of the particle. To compute these characteristic times, relaxation times, we will need to solve more into detail the equations, which we will not do here. Similarly, if we did it, we would manage to find the expressions and to find that  if we work at small Stokes number, the solid phase will be entirely governed by the fluid phase. We will say that the solid phase is slave to the fluid phase. However, when we are at very large Stokes number, the two phases are entirely uncoupled. The Stokes number intervenes in a very large number of problems of sedimentation or fluid/particles mixtures.
The Froude number is used a lot in hydraulics, we define it as being the ration between a velocity and the square root of g, g being the acceleration constant and h being a characteristic height of the flow.
In hydraulics, the Froude number is essentially interpreted as a ratio of a characteristic velocity of the flow compared to a characteristic velocity of waves, or also as a kinetic energy over a potential energy. It will allow us to define two types of flow, flows when we are at Froude number > 1 that we will call super-critical. The case where Froude = 1 will be the critical flow. The flows super critical are also called torrential flows. When we are smaller than 1, the flow will be sub-critical, we will speak of fluvial flows. Finally, to do the link with the previous chapter, the capillarity number that is defined as following : Î¼ is the dynamic viscosity, u the velocity and Î³ the surface tension. When the capillarity number is very small compared to 1, the effects of surface tension are very important compared to the viscous stresses and we cannot at all neglect these effects of surface tension.
However, when this capillarity number is very large compared to 1, we can neglect the effects of surface tension. There exists many other dimensionless number, the 
Bond, Weber or Kapitza number that are also used and that are in fact numbers relatively similar with expressions slightly different from the capillarity number. All dimensionless number has a physical interpretation, in general we can interpret it as the ratio of a length or a ratio of forces or a ratio of time. For example if I take the example of the Reynolds number, we have defined as following, if I multiply on top and on the bottom by u and that I put the l at the denominator, I see that here I appear a Ï�u^2 which is the inertia and here
I see appearing Î¼(u/l), what we have seen in chapter 1 is thus here a velocity gradient, so Î¼* velocity gradient will be a shear stress. The Reynolds number can be interpreted as a ratio between the inertia and the viscous stress or shear stress. We could also interpret it differently by interpreting it as a ratio of characteristic time between a characteristic time of turbulence compared to a characteristic time of the flow. The characteristic time of the flow will be here the characteristic length of the flow divided by its characteristic velocity.
However, the characteristic time of the turbulence will be the characteristic length of the flow squared, divided by the kinematic viscosity. This characteristic time is a time that is used to characteristic the diffusion, we will see that in chapter 6, the diffusion of turbulence. We could also continue by showing that the Reynolds number can be interpret as a ratio of characteristic length. What we've just did for the Reynolds number can be re-iterated for all dimensionless quantities.
For the Stocks number, the Froude number, there exists different possible interpretation.
We will see them progressively. Note that in general a Reynolds number or any other dimensionless number is defined with characteristics quantities of the flow so at macroscopic scales. Sometimes, we need to introduce what is going on at a scale much thinner, at a scale microscopic. For example when we study a sedimentation of particles, we will introduce a local Reynolds number and in this case here, the characteristic quantities will not be the characteristic quantities of the flow but of the size of the particles, and the characteristic velocity will be a characteristic velocity of sedimentation of the particle and not the velocity of the fluid. We will define in this case a local Reynolds number that will characterize the problem of sedimentation at the scale of the particle. We are now armed with these reminders on the physical notions, we will now approach a little more precisely the notion of similarity in physics through a concrete example which will be the example of the pendulum.
