Welcome to the second part of chapter five of basic steps in magnetic resonance.
One of the most important manifestations of longitudinal relaxation is the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE).
Nuclear Overhauser effects were postulated by a theoretician,
Albert Overhauser, in 1953.
Initially, Overhauser postulated that the effect that now carries his name, would occur in solids.
More specifically in conducting solids, such as lithium metal.
In lithium metal, there are conduction electrons, and some of them have unpaired spins.
Therefore, there is an
EPR resonance that we can saturate by microwave irradiation.
Overhauser then predicted that if you heat up the electrons in this fashion, you would cool down the nuclei so that the amplitude of the NMR transitions of lithium-6 or lithium-7 would actually be enhanced by the irradiation.
This is a paradox, and many physicists of those days did not believe Overhauser until Charlie Slichter came along and actually proved experimentally that Overhauser was right.
It was discovered that the effect was not specific to conducting metals, but also possible in liquids.
It was Ionel Solomon, at the Ecole Polytechnique in Paris, who proved this, and he also developed the appropriate theory.
Now, in this chapter, we shall not be concerned with the case of metallic conductors, such as lithium, but focus on isolated pairs of nuclei in a molecule which is in a liquid, and the molecule is tumbling with a typical correlation function.
If we have two spins immersed in a magnetic field, we have a state where the two spins are parallel with the magnetic field.
We have a state where the two spins are anti-parallel.
And we have a case where one spin is up and the other is down.
And of course, the reverse is also possible.
Between these four states, we have observable transitions.
In fact, we have two transitions that belong to the X multiplet.
And we have two transitions that belong to the A multiplet.
We discussed this in the chapter dedicated to scalar couplings.
We also have longitudinal relaxation processes with rates that are called W which stands for probability in German.
W comes from the word
Wahrscheinlichkeit.
I believe that it was Wolfgang Pauli who first used W to explain relaxation in multi-level systems using the so-called master equation.
W is just a transition probability.
One can distinguish the transition probability where a single spin, say spin A, is flipping.
From here to here, only the first spin flips from beta to alpha.
Whereas the second spin doesn't move.
This is the single-quantum probability that A is flipping.
This parallel transition of spin A, in most cases, has the same probability.
Whereas these two transitions are distinct since it is now spin X that flips, with a single-quantum flip.
And therefore, we call this W1^X.
More surprisingly, there is also a probability of a so-called flip-flop process, also known as a zero-quantum process because there is no overall absorption of any quanta.
One quantum is emitted and one is absorbed.
And therefore, we have a zero-quantum process.
In this case, both spins A and X participate, so this is known as a W0^AX.
And finally, there is also the possibility that spins that are in the beta-beta situation, fall down all the way to the ground state in the alpha-alpha position.
And this is known as a double-quantum process involving both spins A and X.
The energy levels of a homonuclear pair of two spin 1/2 nuclei, A and X, actually hide a tremendous wealth of information.
If we wanted to see what happens with the flow of populations, we have the so-called master equation, where we can write the populations of the states.
For example, n-beta-beta, n-beta-alpha, n-alpha-beta, and n-alpha-alpha. We can write the populations as a vector.
There must be some time dependence.
We can construct a matrix, and look at the deviations of the different populations from their thermal equilibrium.
If these deviations vanish, we are in a stationary state and nothing happens.
But if the deviations do not vanish, we shall have a non-vanishing time-derivative of the populations driven by the deviations from thermal equilibrium.
The deviation delta n(t) is equal to n(t) - n(equilibrium).
The matrix W is a four-by-four matrix.
You can easily determine its elements.
The diagonal elements are equal to minus the sum over the off-diagonal elements on the same row, with i different from j.
That means there is a conservation of populations. If a fraction of the population is taken out of one of the levels and transferred to another level, overall, it is conserved.
In the matrix W of transition probabilities, there are really only two that contribute to the Overhauser effect.
There is the double-quantum probability, where both spins A and X flip at the same time.
It turns out that this is proportional to the spectral density taken at twice the Larmor frequency.
So you will recall that the Larmor frequency could be, say, 400 MHz.
So twice the Larmor frequency would be 800 MHz
The Overhauser effect is also crucially effected by the flip-flop probability, that is to say the zero-quantum probability.
This proportional to the spectral density at the origin.
Or if you prefer, to the probability that the molecule does not undergo any rotational motion at all.
So if we plot the spectral density on a linear scale, rather than on a logarithmic scale, then we see different behaviour.
A small molecule, such as for example, H2O, could rotate at very high speeds without falling apart.
It turns out that the probability of rotational diffusion is about equal at all frequencies, and we speak of a â€œwhite spectrumâ€�, an analogy to the light that comes us from the sun where all colours are equally represented so that their superposition gives the feeling that the light is white.
Of course, these are not visible colours, since they are radio-frequencies.
If all colours are equally represented, the spectrum is said to be white.
If, on the other hand, we look at a large object, such as a protein, then it is obvious that it cannot undergo rotational diffusion at very high frequencies because it would fall apart.
It would disintegrate because of centrifugal forces.
Consequently, high frequencies are essentially forbidden.
The protein is compelled to be content with slow motions.
And consequently, the likelihood that it does not move at all, which is represented by the spectral density at the origin, is much higher than for the simple case of water.
If we look at the spectral density at the Larmor frequency, is not completely negligible for a protein, much larger than for water.
And if we look at twice the Larmor frequency, then it goes essentially to zero for a large protein.
Whereas for water, it is still about the same, regardless of frequency.
The dependence of the double-quantum probability and of the zero-quantum probability on the correlation time is as follows.
For the zero-quantum probability, the flip-flop rate is simply proportional to J(0).
It turns out that this simply increases: the bigger the molecule, the slower the tumbling, the higher the zero-quantum rate.
For the double-quantum probability, the situation is a bit more complicated because when we go from very fast tumbling to slower tumbling, the double-quantum probability reaches a maximum when the Larmor frequency is close to the inverse of the correlation time.
The double-quantum probability drops for faster or slower tumbling.
Clearly, there must be a cross-over point where these two terms cancel each other.
It turns out that there are some analogies between the Overhauser effect, as we observe it today in proteins, and more generally in liquids and solutions, and the Overhauser effect that was originally predicted to occur in conducting solids such as lithium metal.
This is the energy-level diagram of a two-spin system in a liquid.
If the scalar coupling is zero, then the two lines of the X nucleus, the two parallel transitions, are degenerate.
And in fact, we only see one single peak at the chemical shift of spin X.
Likewise, the two transitions of spin A are degenerate, and we see only one line at the chemical shift of spin A.
Now, we can instruct the radio-frequency source of our NMR spectrometer to selectively irradiate the resonances of spin X, i.e., the two superimposed resonances.
If we do that, we equalize the populations across the X transitions.
In fact, we â€œdemagnetizeâ€� these transitions.
As a result, the X signal will vanish.
If we look at what happens to the A transitions, in some cases, they are amplified, in other words, the peak gets more intense.
Whereas in other cases, it can actually be reversed.
This depends on the conditions.
And clearly, something very peculiar happens.
You might expect that irradiation of spin X will warm up the spin system, and therefore also saturate spin A, but that is not the case.
This is precisely the paradox that Albert Overhauser discovered.
The nuclear Overhauser effect actually results from an interplay between relaxation and irradiation.
Relaxation tends to drive us back to Boltzmannâ€™s equilibrium.
Before we address this equilibrium, we should look at the ways of distributing the populations among the four states.
If we look at our two two coupled spins, we should focus attention on the deviations of the populations with respect to the demagnetized state.
If we had a demagnetized state, all states, alpha-alpha, alpha-beta, beta-alpha, and beta-beta, would have the same populations P = 0.25.
These two white balls, tell us that the beta-beta state is depleted with respect to the demagnetized state.
Whereas, the alpha-alpha state is more populated than in the demagnetized state.
If we do some accountancy, we see that between the alpha-alpha state, which has two black symbols, and the alpha-beta state, which has no symbol at all, there is an difference of 2 - 0 =  2 delta.
The same is true here, and it turns out the same is true here.
We have 0 - (-2), which is also + 2.
The next thing that we have to do is to saturate the X transitions.
In thermal equilibrium, we have a depleted beta-beta state, and an over-populated alpha-alpha state.
If we irradiate the X transitions, we deliberately equalize these populations.
So basically, we promote one of these black balls to the upper level.
We also saturate these two transitions, which means that we bring down one of these white balls from the beta-beta to the beta-alpha level.
At this point, once the saturation has been achieved, which can be done in a few milliseconds or so, we have a new distribution, but we still have the simple difference of 2-delta between this level and this level, since +1 -(-1) = +2.
Here again, +1 -(-1) = +2.
The transitions of spin A have not been changed.
So we can go from the thermal equilibrium situation to this partly saturated state, where the X transitions have been saturated.
That is to say, their population differences have been annihilated by irradiation.
Whereas these population differences have been preserved.
The Overhauser effect comes about because we have flip-flop or flip-flip transitions.
The probability of the zero-quantum flip-flop transition will tend to carry populations from right to left so that the excess population that we have in the alpha-beta state will tend to fill up the deficiency of the population in the beta-alpha state.
At the same time, of course, this horizontal process has no effect whatsoever on the populations of the top and bottom states.
Consequently, these populations are preserved, whereas the central states are depleted.
One of the consequences is that the difference in populations is now just +1 - 0 = + 1 delta, whereas it was + 2 delta before.
In this case, the population difference is 0 - (-1) = +1 delta, instead of +2 delta.
In other words, we see an attenuation of the difference in populations across these transitions compared to what they were before the zero-quantum flip-flop process set in.
A more puzzling aspect occurs when the double-quantum probability is dominant.
We shall see that this is only possible for small molecules.
So this is a pathway for small molecules.
Whereas the previous pathway was predominant for large molecules, such as for proteins.
Small molecules can have a large flip-flip probability, so there will be a tendency for the populations to drop from the top level to the bottom level.
Now you might say, â€œthere is already a difference in populations."
"So why should we go to a larger difference?"
Well, the reason is that in thermal equilibrium, there was indeed a larger difference.
We had difference of (+2) - (-2) = + 4 delta, between these two extreme states.
Since relaxation drives the populations back to thermal equilibrium, the result of the flip-flip probability is to increase the deficit here from one white ball to two white balls, and to increase this population from one black ball to two black balls.
This is quite remarkable.
We see that the difference in population across the A transition here is (+2) - (-1) = 3 delta.
And likewise this difference is
(+1) - (-2) = 3 delta, as before.
With respect to the initial difference of 2 delta, we have an amplification of the difference of populations, and an amplification of the signal that we observe.
Whereas here, we have a simple attenuation.
The nuclear Overhauser effect is often described by this parameter eta, which is defined as the intensity of the signal that we observe in the presence of rf irradiation minus the intensity that we observe in a normal spectrum, normalized by the intensity in the normal spectrum.
If we have an amplification, eta = 0.5, which is typically the case for a homonuclear system in a small molecule.
But if there is an attenuation, we can go all the way to eta = -1, for slowly tumbling large molecules.
So far, we have been talking here about steady-state Overhauser effects which are somewhat distinct from transient Overhauser effects that we shall exploit in macromolecules.
It turns out that Overhauser effects also occur in heteronuclear systems.
And in that case, eta is proportional to the ratio of the gyromagnetic ratio of the spin S that we saturate, divided by the gyromagnetic ratio of the spin I that we observe.
For Overhauser effects in heteronuclear systems. the parameter eta is equal to 1/2 times the ratio of the gammas, the gyromagnetic ratio of the spin S that we saturate, divided by the gyromagnetic ratio of the spin I that we observe.
So, if we consider carbon-13 as a nucleus that we observe, then the parameter eta that we obtain when we irradiate the protons would be equal to 1/2 of the gamma of the protons divided by the gamma of the carbon-13 nuclei.
This is about 1/2 times 4 = 2.
And consequently, we have a three-fold enhancement because the amplitude goes from 1 to 3.
But be careful, if we look at other nuclei, for example, at nitrogen-15, which is very popular in biomolecules, then the eta that we obtain when irradiating the protons is equal to the ratio of the gammaâ€™s which is about 10/-1, because the gyromagnetic ratio of nitrogen-15 is negative.
So eta turns out to be about -5.
This means that if we have a nitrogen-15 spectrum with a positive peak if we do not irradiate the protons, we may observe a large negative peak when we irradiate the protons.
This is rather surprising.
In fact, this is one thing that I didn't believe myself until I did the experiment many years ago.
We should remember, by the way, that the Overhauser effect is not always 100% efficient.
And sometimes we get less then the predicted maximum, and sometimes we get exactly zero if we are halfway between positive and negative effects.
The carbon-13 spectrum has a maximum enhancement of a factor three. which is commonly observed, and indeed very welcome.
This concludes part two of this chapter.
Thank you for you attention.
