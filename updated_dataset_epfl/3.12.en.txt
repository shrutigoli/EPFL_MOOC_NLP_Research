Welcome back, <i>Nature in Code</i>, we're in Chapter 3, lecture 12.
In this lecture I'd like to develop this third insight that I promised in the last lecture, that we could gain from this simple formula.
So we left off with this observation here, namely that the genetic variation in the next generation is this term here:
<i>(1 - 1 / 2 N)</i> times the genetic variation at this point.
And so, from this simple formula we could deduce two major insights, namely that genetic drift acts to reduce genetic variation because this term is always smaller than one.
So that was probably the major insight.
And the second insight was that this crucially depends on the population size.
So if the population size is small, this term will be smaller and so the effect is going to be stronger.
And now we would like to develop a third insight and that has to do with the timing.
So if we start observing the genetic variation in the beginning, and I'm going to call this <i>H_0</i> with the index zero, just to denote the beginning then we can easily calculate the genetic variation in the next generation, so <i>H_1</i>, by using exactly this formula, so this is simply going to be
<i>(1 - 1 / (2 N))</i> times what we have in H_0.
Correspondingly in the next generation, so <i>H_2</i>, I would have
<i>(1 - 1 / (2 N)) H_1</i>, and I've already expressed <i>H_1</i> here in terms of <i>H_0</i>, so I can basically replace this by writing this term,
<i>(1 - 1 / (2 N)) H_0</i>.
And then, in <i>H_3</i>, exact same principle,
<i>(1 - 1 / (2 N))</i> times the genetic variation before so that would be H_2, and, again, I've already expressed H_2 up here, in terms of H_0,
I'm going to replace this again.
I'm just going to do this one more time.
So <i>(1 - 1 / (2 N))</i> times <i>(1 - 1 / (2 N))</i> times <i>H_0</i> and so on.
So you can see that <i>H_t</i> can be calculated by simply saying,
I have to multiply (1 - 1 / (2 N))<i>
H times, so </i>(1 - 1 / (2 N))* to the power of t, times <i>H_0</i>.
And so this now tells us something interesting as well.
It tells us that as t goes to infinity, so in a very long time span, this term will reduce to zero and so genetic variation will go to zero.
And that's also a crucial insight.
It's not the insight that I was talking about, but it's also a crucial insight just to realize that genetic drift will not only reduce genetic variation it will act to completely eliminate it.
And that's actually quite a profound thought, if you think about it.
In the absence of any other process genetic variation would be completely lost from the world, so there could be no genetic variation because random chance would essentially eliminate it.
Genetic drift would eliminate it.
And so that's obviously not the case.
We have a lot of genetic variation in the world, and there must be some process that counteracts genetic drift, and we will meet and study this process in Chapter 4.
But for now, this is one crucial insight but I'd like to be more specific and I'd still like to get a better handle on the speed of this entire process of the reduction of genetic variation.
But now that we have this equation here expressing the genetic variation at any point in time, in the context of genetic variation in the beginning we can ask ourselves very specific questions such as, okay, if I start with a certain genetic variation, for example, how long is it going to take until this genetic variation is reduced by half?
And this is a very common concept that you may know from chemistry or physics, this concept of a half-time of a certain quantity being reduced by half.
This gives you a good feeling for how fast a process is.
So we can express this by writing here the genetic initial variation divided by half equals the genetic variation at this point.
So when is this true?
When is the genetic variation exactly equal to the genetic variation that we have in the beginning reduced by half?
So at this point, so now we need to solve for <i>t</i> finding out when exactly this happens, when the initial genetic variation is reduced by 50%.
And we can do this, first we need to bring in <i>t</i>, and we can easily do this because we've already expressed
<i>H_t</i> in terms of <i>t</i>, mainly by <i>(1 - 1 / (2N))</i> to the power of <i>t</i> times <i>H_0</i>.
So now we simply need to solve this equation for <i>t</i> and then we know how long it's going to take to reduce the initial genetic variation by half.
And the first step that we're going to do here is to simply get rid of the H zero on both sides, so basically dividing both sides by <i>H_0</i>, and that means we'll have to write a 1 here, and here it means we can get rid of it altogether.
Now I have the t in the exponent here.
That's never good if you want to solve for something that's in the exponent so let's bring it down, and we of course bring it down by using the logarithm.
So the logarithm of this term equals the logarithm of this term and now we can bring the exponent down here so times t.
Good, so that's a good intermediary step.
Now we don't have any exponents anymore.
So how do we solve further for <i>t</i>?
So we can't get much farther here without using an approximation.
And the approximation that I want to use here is the following, namely that the logarithm of a number that's close to 1...
Okay, so ln (1 + x), x being some small number is roughly, approximately, equal to x.
And you can easily test this if you open a calculator and I'm going to open the calculator here in the browser, in Google, and I can now simply you know, for example, type ln of 1.1 and you can see that this this is 0.09, so very close to 0.1.
So ln 1.1 equals ln (1 + x), so x being 0.1 and you can see this is roughly true.
Now actually if I type this again and I use a slightly smaller x let's do 1.01, so x being 0.01, you can see this is now very close, and you can test this even further,
<i>ln(1.001)</i>, this being very close to 0.001.
So this approximation is really a good approximation, and it's getting better the smaller x.
So I'm going to use this approximation here where <i>- 1 / (2N)</i> is my <i>x</i> here.
So this term is approximately equal to <i>- 1 / (2N)</i>.
So I can simply say, okay,
<i>ln(1 / 2)</i> is approximately
<i>- 1 / (2 N) t</i>.
That already looks much simpler.
Now, I can multiply by <i>- 2 N</i> to get rid of this here and then we get this nice approximation here which is <i>ln(1 / 2) (- 2 N)</i> is roughly <i>t</i>.
Now, ln (1/2) equals to - ln (2).
Because, as you may know from basic math,
<i>ln (1 / x) = - ln (x)</i>.
So <i>ln(1 / 2) = - ln (2) (- 2 N) â‰ˆ </i>t*.
And so we can rewrite this now by saying, this is minus times minus is plus, so <i>2 N ln (2) â‰ˆ t</i>.
Now if you calculate what this is,
<i>ln (2)</i> is actually roughly 0.7.
And so we have <i>0.7</i> times <i>2 N</i>, which is of course <i>1.4 N</i>.
So this is roughly <i>1.4 N</i>.
And here now we have the solution, the approximate solution.
<i>t â‰ˆ 1.4 N</i>
So what does that mean?
Well, it means that it takes approximately <i>1.4 N</i> generations for genetic variation to be reduced by half due to genetic drift.
So if you think about this, let's say you have a population of 10,000 individuals, sort of a medium-size population, it's going to take roughly 14,000 generations to reduce genetic variation by half.
So, in other words, for populations of this size genetic drift is by and large a slow process.
It's a potent force, but it is, the reduction itself, is relatively slow.
And of course, if you think about an even larger population, so let's say, <i>N</i> would be one million, that of course would then simply mean that it's going to take 
1.4 million generations to simply reduce genetic variation by half and then another 1.4 million to, again, reduce that genetic variation by half and so on.
And vice versa, of course, if you have very small population sizes let's say, <i>N = 100</i>, then this process is, of course, faster,
140 generations, roughly.
So, this is the insight that I wanted to generate here in this lecture.
It is that genetic variation is a potent force but it's not exactly the fastest, and it depends a little... well, not a little, but it depends directly on the population size.
So if <i>N</i> is very large, the population size is very large, this can be a very, very slow process.
And if N is very small, this can be a relatively fast process, but you can easily calculate this with this simple formula which is that to reduce genetic variation, on average you are going to need roughly <i>1.4 N</i> generations.
So this concludes the short mathematical excursion.
So we developed three major insights from very simple, basic principles, namely that genetic drift acts to reduce genetic variation, number 1.
Number 2, this process is going to be stronger if <i>N</i> is small, or vice versa, it's going to be weaker if <i>N</i> is large, and we also established how fast this process is and we can see here that it depends on the population size with roughly this equation, the time to half the genetic variation is roughly 1.4 times the population size.
So, in the next video we'll continue to implement these ideas and new ideas, actually, that we'll develop in Javascript code.
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
