Hello and welcome to this 4th module of the second chapter of the course on fluid mechanics. This 4th module deals with the competition between the phenomena of surface tension and the phenomena of gravity.
We will, in particular introduce a length very important which dictates many phenomena of the everyday life, namely the capillarity length. In order to understand this competition, we will introduce a first small experiment which is extremely simple, we deposit a small drop on a solid substrate, as we see on this photograph, the droplet adopts the shape of a spherical cap and the reason for it is that it must simultaneously minimize its surface energy, in which case the best possible shape is a shape of a complete sphere, but it must also satisfy the wetting condition that we saw in the third module, i.e. that the contact angle between the solid surface and the droplet must be fixed by its value given by Young's relation. It is thus that this problem of minimization has for solution a spherical cap, i.e. a spherical portion. As we see here, on this inlay, we see that if we try to fit the shape of the droplet by projection a piece of circle, the agreement is excellent. However, if we deposit a big droplet on a glass slide, we see that this one absolutely does not take the shape of a spherical cap, it does not minimize in any case the surface energy, but it minimizes on the contrary its potential energy by adopting a shape of a puddle extremely flat. The question that wew will ask ourselves now, is to know what conditions on the size of a droplet, this droplet will prefer to take shape of spherical cap or a shape of a puddle. Let's consider in a general way, a droplet of size h, of shape completely arbitrary, for the moment we can imagine it cubic, and let's try to estimate with a dimensional analysis what we sometimes call in
English terms "a scaling", what are the orders of magnitude of the surface energies and potential energies in play ? The order of magnitude of the surface energy is given by the product of the coefficient of surface tension Î³ multiplied by h^2, it is indeed h the only length that we have in this system. We will thus build the product of a coefficient of surface energy by a surface, which gives me an energy.
If I must determine the potential energy,
I must think that the potential energy is nothing more than the work of weight, it is therefore the weight Ï�gh^3 multiplied by a length, and the only characteristic length that I have is again h, this gives me Ï�gh^4, it must be clear that here
I have put proportional signs so there is in these relations, if we want to clarify precisely, numerical coefficients that can be products of rational numbers, of Pi, of any kind of numbers that would come from the geomtrical analysis but that depend strongly on the geometry that we consider whereas the interest of dimensional analysis, or "scaling analysis" is to estimate these contributions of surface energy and potential energy independently of the detail of the droplet, and that is why that in manner a little provocative
I have chosen a cubic droplet to begin this argument. Now, we will meet two situations : either the term of surface energy will be bigger than the term of potential energy or conversely. The condition at which the surface energy is bigger than the potential energy is the following : Î³*h^2 must be greater than  Ï�*g*h^4, which means that h^2 must be smaller, those are all positive numbers, than Î³ / (Ï�*g), in other words, h must be smaller than sqrt[Î³ / (Ï�*g)].
In this first situation, h is greater than the potential energy and the droplet will adopt a spherical cap shape. When h is smaller to sqrt[Î³ / (Ï�*g)], the surface energy dominates compared to the potential energy and we are expecting to encounter a shape of droplet that is a shape of spherical cap as we have seen in the case of the small droplet, indeed, this gives a length of transition between the small droplets that adopt a shape of spherical cap and the big droplets.
Indeed, when h is this time greater than sqrt[Î³ / (Ï�*g)], the surface energy is smaller than the potential energy, the droplet prefers to minimize its potential energy than minimize its surface energy, it abandons the idea of taking a spherical shape but prefers to take the shape of a puddle and so, it appears very natural in this reasoning a characteristic length  sqrt[Î³ / (Ï�*g)] that is named capillary length and is often noted Î»C and when we put the right values of surface tension, of density, of gravity acceleration, we discover that this length is roughly equal, at 20Â°C, 2,7 mm for water and air.
In fact, this quantity (2,7 mm) is at the origin of huge numbers of phenomena that surround us in the daily life. In particular, if we pour water in a glass we see that the meniscus is deforming near the lateral surface of the glass and is deforming over a characteristic height that is of a few millimeters and over a characteristic distance that is also of the order of a few millimeters. These few millimeters are precisely the capillary length.
Similarly, when we leave the faucet leak, we see that the droplets that are detaching from it are droplets that simply have a few millimeters of diameter, here again, their size is fixed by the capillary length.
Other example, I deposit paint on a ceiling, droplets are formed, if the droplets that are initially formed have characteristic sizes that are smaller than the capillary length, they will not detach and they will not pearl from the ceiling, hence the paint will remain hanged to the ceiling.
Similarly, in all sorts of capillary phenomena in waterfalls and other phenomena of percolation of water in the underground cavities, we have phenomena of runoff with an attachment of capillary film or of the capillary droplet to horizontal surfaces when these droplets or these thicknesses of film are smaller than the capillary length. Last case, that will allows me to come back on the quiz I gave you at the very first module, the size of a raindrop is also fixed by the capillary length and this actually comes from the fact that when a bigger droplet is produced, let's imagine, it will fragment until that exactly the effects of gravity that are making the raindrop fall and the capillary effects are more or less in equilibrium, i.e. the droplet is roughly equal to the capillary length. Naturally,
I say roughly, there is a certain dispersion in the size of the droplets. It is for me the way to explain why these droplets are not profiled forwards, nor profiled backwards but they are spherical. The reason is very simple, as at this scale here, i.e. the scale of a few millimeters that is indeed the size of a majority of raindrops falling from the sky, the surface tension is a dominant effect in comparison with the gravity and that the gravity is in equilibrium with the aerodynamic drag force that is slowing down the droplet and allowing it to reach its limit velocity. The phenomenon that dominates is indeed the phenomenon of energy of surface tension. The surface tension dictates a spherical shape, hence, this droplet takes a spherical shape. Another phenomenon in which there is a competition extremely interesting between surface tension and gravity, is the phenomenon called capillary rise. You simply have to take a straw and to put in contact this straw
(or capillary tube) in a liquid bath.
We see, you already all did it at least once in your life, that the liquid climbs in the tube, it is a bit the principle of the pipette. It actually climbs of a length that is widely greater than the capillary length. It can climb several centimeters whereas in the case of air as I was saying, the capillary length is typically a few millimeters, so, why
? In order to answer this question, we must anticipate a little on the next course by introducing the basis of hydrostatics.
The basis of hydrostatics are such that for a fluid at rest, it is Pascal's law, the pressure gradient is equal to - Ï�g where g is the gravity acceleration, which results in the case of a recipient with vertical walls in the following manner
: The pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure at the liquid's surface minus Ï�gz with z directed upwards hence you observe, and this is natural, that the pressure is stronger at the bottom of the recipient. This is the first ingredient that we need, the second ingredient that we need, is to remember that the interface is curved, we have a meniscus on top of this liquid column that has climbed and this meniscus adopts a curvature that will have to be determined, that we will call R. Given the shape of the meniscus, you can already guess that the pressure inside the liquid
(so in this meniscus) is smaller than the atmospheric pressure. It is that, this depression, this sort of suction, this sucking force that is making the fluid climb.
Let's zoom in a little closer to the triple line that was the subject of module 3 of this course, the region where the gas, the liquid and the solid are in contact and we have learned in the previous module that in this configuration, the contact angle Î¸ is given by Young's relation as a function of three physico-chemical properties that are : the surface tension liquid-gas, the surface tension solid-gas and the surface tension solid-liquid. For us, what is important to remember is that cos Î¸ is fixed by the physic-chemistry of the interface and fluids in presence. 
Now, if we look at a slice of this spherical cap interface, we see r the capillary radius, we also see Î¸ the contact angle and the question that we ask ourselves is : "What is the length of the curvature radius ?" I.e. what is the radius of the spherical cap
? To do so, we must remember that by definition of a circle, the angle must be right between the tangent of the circle and the radius and as the vertical is perpendicular to the horizontal, we see that the red angle also has Î¸ for value, so it becomes extremely easy to determine the radius of curvature R which is simply equal to r/ cos Î¸. Let's go back to our phenomenon of capillary rise, we see that there are two ways to determine the pressure in A. The first one is to determine it by a capillary argument, like we just have done. The pressure
A is thus equal to p0, the atmospheric pressure, minus 2Î³*cos Î¸ / r.  Cosine Î¸/r,  is the curvature radius and the 2 comes from the fact that it concerns a spherical cap and not a piece of circle. A second way to determine the pressure in A, we simply make a hydrostatic calculation, the pressure in B, given the small deformation of an interface outside the capillary tube is equal to the atmospheric pressure, the small drive of the tube. So the pressure in A is equal to p, atmospheric pressure which is also equal to pB- Ï�*g*z0, z0 being the height. Equalization of these two pressures
: it results that z0, the height of capillary rise is equal to 2Î³*cos Î¸ / Ï�*g*r, it is what we call Jurin's law. 
Hence, the height of capillary rise is inversely proportional to the capillary radius, as we have seen on this picture. Another conclusion, if cos Î¸ is negative, i.e. the contact angle is greater than pi/2 then we can expect a capillary fall, it is a phenomenon indeed encountered with mercury that is very little wetting.
