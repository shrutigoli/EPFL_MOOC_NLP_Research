Welcome back to our MOOC on basic steps in magnetic resonance.
Today we shall be talking about experimental methods that are the subject of chapter 6 of Peter Horeâ€™s book.
This final chapter explains how NMR is really done in practice.
We shall see how the magnetization is excited and then observed and how the time domain signals can be transformed into spectra by Fourier transformation.
We shall explain how one can measure the return of the magnetization to its equilibrium: inversion recovery for longitudinal relaxation, and spin echoes for transverse relaxation.
There are a few examples of more sophisticated methods such as INEPT, COSY, NOESY, and HSQC.
Finally, the idea of three-dimensional NMR opens almost infinite possibilities for novel experiments.
Chapter 6 is built up as follows-- we start with a brief discussion of how the experiments are actually done.
To understand these experiments, one has to follow the magnetization.
A magnetization is best represented in terms of a vector.
Once equipped with such vectors, we can understand how one can measure relaxation times, both longitudinal and transverse relaxation.
We can move to some more sophisticated experiments, such as this one-- this acronym means â€œInsensitive Nuclei Enhanced by Polarization Transfer.â€�
This is one of the most fundamental building blocks of modern NMR.
Then there are several cases of two-dimensional NMR that will be discussed in some detail.
Next a discussion how one can go from two to three dimensions and thus open the way to a very large number of possibilities.
The basic NMR experiment as it is done routinely nowadays, consists very simply in applying a radio-frequency pulse to the sample and immediately afterwards detecting a time-domain signal which is known as â€œfree induction decayâ€�.
Before we apply a pulse, we have to wait for the magnetization to get aligned with the external magnetic field and achieve an equilibrium value which is determined by Boltzmann's law.
The function of the radio-frequency pulse is to excite transverse magnetization, either Mx or My which is perpendicular to the 0-z axis along which the magnetic field is aligned.
Now neither Mx nor My are in an equilibrium position.
The magnetization will tend to return to where it came from.
And in doing so, it will actually precess and induce a signal in the radio-frequency coil which will be amplified and stored in a computer.
The human eye is not well-equipped to detect frequencies, in contrast to the human ear which can do that very nicely.
If we want to â€œseeâ€� the frequencies contained in a signal, we have to carry out a Fourier transform, sometimes represented by an italic F or spelled out as â€œFourier transform.â€�
This transformation will convert the time-domain signal into a frequency-domain signal which we routinely call a â€œspectrum.â€�
In the spectrum, resonances lead to peaks.
The experiment is not ideal.
The sample is typically contained in a tube with 5 or 10 mm outer diameter, depending on the probe of the NMR spectrometer.
This sample tube is immersed in a magnetic field and surrounded by a set of radio-frequency coils.
The static magnetic field B0 is parallel with the axis of the sample tube.
The radio-frequency field B1 is perpendicular to the z-axis.
It is mostly the sample that is contained within the radio-frequency coil that contributes to the signal, whereas the sample that is at the bottom of the tube or above the rf coil will not significantly contribute to the signal.
It turns out that the B0 field is not perfectly homogeneous, so we can imagine that the lines of flux are not parallel.
Consequently, the field is not uniform.
If we consider the magnetization in a volume element, also known as a voxel, in the center-- it will be exposed to a more intense field than if we consider a volume element that is somewhere near the edges of the sample.
In the spectrum, this volume element will give rise to a higher frequency.
So this signal will stem from this voxel.
Whereas this voxel, which is exposed to a less intense magnetic field, will give rise to a somewhat lower frequency.
Because there are many voxels, we have a continuous distribution.
The resulting line-shape can be described by a width.
The width of one component is the â€œinherent widthâ€� or the â€œtrue widthâ€�.
This width is equal to pi/T2, which might want to call the â€œtrue T2â€�, the â€œgenuineâ€�, or â€œhomogeneousâ€� T2.
The overall width is the â€œapparentâ€�, or â€œinhomogeneousâ€� width.
This width is equal to pi/T2*.
Many NMR techniques are concerned with fighting inhomogenous broadening.
The apparent width is broader than the true width.
This is something that one has to keep in mind throughout chapter 6.
The key to understanding
NMR experiments is that the magnetization vector has three components-- the vector M is comprised of Mx, My, and Mz.
By definition, the longitudinal component along the z-axis is parallel to the static magnetic field.
If the M vector only has an Mz component and Mx and My are zero, then it is aligned with the static field.
Since it is in equilibrium, nothing will happen.
So if we want to observe a signal we have to perturb the magnetization by exiting a transverse component.
If there is a transverse component, Mx or My, then it will start to precess around the magnetic field.
The precession frequency is determined by the splitting in the energy-level diagram.
That is not obvious at all.
There is a splitting between the ground state and the excited state.
This splitting determines the angular velocity at which the magnetization precesses.
This is a rather peculiar thing and perhaps a bit difficult for the beginner, but one gets used to it.
The sense of precession in this picture is shown as a clockwise rotation.
It turns out that there is a bit of an argument about this.
Basically, the clockwise rotation was common in the NMR literature until the mid-80s-- it was extensively used by Ray Freeman who had made many beautiful pictures-- and then suddenly in the mid-80s, Richard Ernst at ETH Zurich decided that we really should be rotating counter-clockwise.
You might say that this is irrelevant, but it turns out that there is a lot of confusion in the literature because some people have mixed the two conventions.
This reminds me of a little anecdote about Wolfgang Pauli--
Pauli once gave a lecture about the sense of rotation of the plane of polarization of light in some complicated experiment.
And before he started his lecture he predicted that the plane would rotate towards the left and then two hours later, after filling the blackboard with many complicated equations, he found that the plane was rotating the other way.
And he stepped back from his blackboard and said, "Well, ladies and gentlemen,"
"I'm afraid I must have made a mistake in sign somewhere."
But at the back of the room, there was Professor Paul Dirac, another Nobel laureate, who raised his hand and said,
"Dear colleague, I fear you have made an odd number of mistakes in your signs."
That is very cruel, of course, but very appropriate.
In fact, in NMR, one can make many, many sign errors and with some luck they compensate each other but if you are out of luck, they don't.
In this case, Peter Hore has used an older picture, likewise here, but in the next slides he will move to the â€œcontinentalâ€� description.
Remember that if you rotate this way, youâ€™ll be OK if you're on a roundabout in England, but if you do this on the European continent, or in the United States, you will be in deep trouble.
To understand precession and nutation of the magnetization about the field, we have to look at the resultant of the effective field. This results from the vectorial addition of the static field B0, which is always drawn along the z-axis, and the radio-frequency field B1, which is always in the xy-plane.
This B1 field is the magnetic component of the electromagnetic field, which is normally applied as an oscillating field along some arbitrary axis.
This oscillating field, which is a linearly polarized field can be decomposed into two counter-rotating components.
It turns out to be sufficient to retain only one of these components, the one which rotates in the same sense as the magnetization.
We can neglect the counter-rotating component.
It is convenient to represent what is going on in a so-called â€œrotating frameâ€�, often abbreviated as â€œrotâ€�.
The axes of the rotating frame are labelled xâ€™ and yâ€™, as opposed to x and y although these primes are often dropped in practice.
The frame is defined in such a way that the B1 component appears stationary.
This means that we move with the vector.
If we step on the carousel, we move with the horses so they appear stationary, whereas if we are not on the carousel, we see the horses as moving around.
In the rotating frame, the static field is reduced so that we only have a residual field.
The effective field, is the resultant.
The sum of the two vectors gives a tilted vector.
In the laboratory frame, the angle theta is very small, in fact the effective field is almost parallel to the z-axis whereas in the rotating frame, this angle can be easily made to 90Â°.
We achieve that by adjusting the frequency of the rotating frame so that the residual field disappears.
We can re-draw this picture in the rotating frame.
If we start here and we end up there, we simply move from a transverse component to a longitudinal component.
If T1 and T2 are equal, we actually move along the shortest way, whereas this curved trajectory corresponds to a situation where T2 is shorter than T1.
This means that the transverse magnetization is lost before the longitudinal magnetization recovers.
We can record the signals either by putting an observer here or here.
In this case we would have a cosine wave and in this case it would be a sine wave.
In fact, in modern NMR spectrometers we can detect both x and y components at the same time and we can cook up a complex number which is simply the linear combination of the x component plus i times the y component-- i being the square root of minus one.
This is defined by analogy to shift operators, a classical counterpart as it where.
In fact, we simply have a cosine and a sine wave.
We can write M(t) as a complex number that describes both the amplitude and the phase.
This is the initial value.
It will evolve with the chemical shift and will be attenuated by T2 relaxation 
T2 is the time constant of the decay.
It is interesting to see what happens if we apply a radio-frequency pulse.
This is the equilibrium position.
This shows what happens in a rotating frame where the B1 field appears as a static component of the electromagnetic field.
If we arrange the rotating frame so that the B1 field is parallel to the x-axis, then we have counter-clockwise rotation,
(in the â€œcontinentalâ€� convention), of the magnetization towards the -y-axis.
In fact, in general it will undergo a rotation through a so-called â€œflip angleâ€�, that should be called a nutation angle, but flip angle is the common expression.
This flip angle is simply proportional to B1, the strength of the field, and to the duration of the pulse multiplied by the gyro-magnetic ratio of the nuclei of interest.
So beta can be chosen either to be beta = 90Â° in which case we end up exactly along the -y-axis. 
But we can also consider a pulse with beta = 180Â°
Or a pulse with beta = 270Â° in which case we end up along the + y-axis.
Actually the most surprising is beta = 360Â°-- if we keep going, we end up in the original position after a 360Â° pulse.
That means, surprisingly, that the situation is exactly restored as if there were no pulse at all-- some people have worried what happens with the radio-frequency energy that you have put into the system.
It must somehow go in at one point and come out at some later point.
If we are in the rotating frame, the magnetization that was initially flipped along the - y-axis will start precessing and build up a phase that we can call phi which is nothing else than the product of Omega times t.
And we should remember that this Omega is in the rotating frame so it is simply the precession frequency in the laboratory frame from which we subtract the precession frequency of the rotating frame.
The phase is linearly proportional to time.
It is sometimes convenient if we draw time like this and the phase like this we simply have a line with a constant slope and the slope is given by Omega.
In more sophisticated experiments it will be useful to have such â€œphase-time diagramsâ€�.
This concludes part one of this chapter.
Thank you for your attention.
