The classical orbital parameters, there are six of them, and they describe completely the orbits.
If we add the time, the actual time, then you will know exactly where the spacecraft is with respect to the central body.
We have, first of all, the plane of reference, and if we talk about an orbit of a spacecraft around the Earth, obviously the plane of reference is the plane of the Equator.
If it's orbits in the solar system the plane of reference will be the plane of the ecliptic, the plane of the orbit of the Earth around the Sun.
And we described already the directions of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>, inertial coordinate system.
Now, in the plane of reference, let's take the case of an orbit around the Earth, the plane of reference being the plane of the Equator.
We have the reference direction; we talked about it before also, the direction of the vernal equinox for a certain time, for instance the year 2000, and it's also the direction of <i>x</i> in the planar reference, so <i>y</i> being perpendicular to <i>x</i> and <i>z</i> being to the North Pole.
Now, in the parameters we talked already about <i>e</i> and <i>a</i>
<i>a</i>, in a way, gives the size of the orbit,
<i>e</i> will give the shape of the orbit, we talk here about elliptical orbits, then an important parameter is <i>i</i>, the inclination of the orbital plane, which is also the angle between the north direction and the rotation vector of the motion of the spacecraft around the center of the Earth.
Inclination of the orbital plane, <i>i</i> = 0 means equatorial orbits are equal to 90 degrees, it means a polar orbit.
We have then the longitude or right ascension of the ascending node.
The ascending node is here.
The spacecraft going in this direction is passing from the southern celestial hemisphere to the northern on a point on the plane of reference which is the so-called ascending node.
The descending node is just on the other side, where the spacecraft go from the north to the south.
The longitude of the ascending node is the angle between the direction of <i>x</i> and the direction of the ascending node from the center of the Earth.
We have then the argument of the periapsis in the orbital plane.
We use always a term
<i>longitude</i> or <i>right ascension</i> in the plane of reference, but in the plane of the orbit we use the term <i>argument</i>.
So the argument of the periapsis is the angle between the line of nodes or the direction of the ascending node and the direction of the periapsis, which is here on this drawing.
Now, we have these five parameters so far.
We have a sixth one, which is the time of periapsis transit, at what time the spacecraft was at this location.
If, in addition, we give the current time, <i>t</i>, then we have the precise position of the spacecraft around the Earth.
In practice we don't use that much all these orbital parameters, the classical orbital parameters, but we use more the concept of the so-called <i>state vector</i>.
The state vector, as we see here, is <i>X, Y, Z, áºŠ, áºŽ, Å»</i>, and the time, and this is obviously with respect to inertial coordinate system.
Let's take, again, the example of a spacecraft on orbit around the Earth.
It's going to be <i>X, Y, Z, áºŠ, áºŽ, Å»</i> in the geocentric-inertial coordinate system.
Now you have six parameters in the state vector, and onboard the Space Shuttle, for instance, we had in the onboard computers a constant so-called propagation of the state vector.
The Shuttle knew always where it was, and what its velocity was, and as it was integrating the laws of motion it knew also exactly where it was going to be in one hour, or where it was an hour ago.
Propagation of the state vector.
And you can imagine, if you are on the Space Shuttle, and you have a knowledge, within the Space Shuttle, of the exact position and velocity vector, and you also propagate, for instance, the state vector of a target.
If you do a rendezvous with a target then if you have these two state vectors, you have an idea in which direction and what distance the target is.
So in a rendezvous that we'll cover later in the course the propagation of the own state vector of the chaser, and the state vector of the target is a very useful tool to perform a rendezvous.
But, again, there is a one-to-one correlation between the six parameters of the state vector and the six classical orbital parameters that we talked about before.
Let's talk about the mean solar day and the sidereal day.
The sidereal day, first of all, is the time it takes for the Earth to make one full rotation with respect to the stars.
The mean solar day is the time it takes for the Earth to make one full rotation with respect to the Sun.
And we talk about mean solar day, because as the orbit of the Earth around the Sun is not circular but elliptical, the time it takes for two consecutive passes of the Sun in the meridian, of a given point on the surface of the Earth, varies a little bit, in a very slight manner along the year, so we talk about the mean solar day, but the sidereal day is fixed.
And if we take the situation here, where one given day, we look to the south at what the meridian, the meridian is a plane, south, zenith, north, in the meridional plane we have, at the same time, the Sun and the star crossing the meridian.
Now, after 23 hours and 56 minutes and 04 seconds, and this is one sidereal day, we have the star, in red, again in the meridian.
And the sun has moved, with respect to the stars, a little bit to the left, about one degree per day.
That's the motion of the Sun with respect to the stars, because it's one complete revolution of 360 degrees in one full year, so it's about one degree per day to the east or to the left.
So, after one sidereal day, we have the star, which is, again, crossing the meridian, and it takes a little more time until the Sun crosses the meridian, and it's about 3 minutes 56 seconds more, so that the duration of the mean solar day is 24 hours, but the duration of the sidereal day, rotation of the Earth with respect to the star, is about four minutes less.
The Gregorian days versus Julian days.
In fact, the Gregorian calendar, which is the calendar we use, divided in years, in months, weeks and days, is not ideal for astronomers and for people who are managing and planning space missions with spacecrafts that are moving, either around the Earth or in the solar system.
You like to have a system where the days are counting progressively upwards without having this awkward division in years, months, and days.
I'm not going to go into the detail of the explanation of the Julian days, but let's say that on January the first, of the year 2000, at zero hours universal time, you had a Julian day 245 1544.
It was the middle of that Julian day.
And then the Julian days are increasing, one after the other, constantly increasing by one day per day in the Gregorian calendar.
But, again, you don't have that awkward division, which is impractical for astronomers and experts in the space systems.
Julian day is used very, very commonly in astronomy and in the space business.
Now, we have an expression allowing the conversion of Gregorian days into Julian Days.
It's really complicated;
I won't go into the detail of that, but so that you know, on a given Gregorian day, a certain year, certain month, and certain day in the month, then you can convert into the Julian day, use that formula.
Use it if you need to.
Again, it's not very common to use it, because usually we just use Julian days.
We have a launch of a spacecraft on a given Julian day, and so many Julian days later it will get to gravity assist around a planet, like Venus, or Mars, and then if we go to Jupiter, or it will go to a comet like the Rosetta spacecraft of the European Space Agency, and then after a certain number of Julian days it will get in a rendezvous with a comet, and it's much more practical to use that scale rather than the Gregorian calendar scale.
