Hello and welcome to the first unit of our MOOC on ecological monitoring.
This unit introduces the concept of ecological monitoring.
It will help us better understand how this monitoring is operated.
No panic. We will go into further details in the next unit.
Let's follow the line to identify the questions we need to ask ourselves.
Why proceed to ecological monitoring?
We will see why it is important.
What it's connection with planning is.
We will see how it contributes to the effectiveness of our actions and so on.
What is ecological monitoring and definitely what is it not?
How to differentiate it from inventories or research for instance.
What is it for? How does it feed the decision making process or does it give accounts on the state of the protected area values; on the pressures, on the threats, on the impact of our work?
How to define it's objectives.
More specifically we need to look at what values to monitor.
What ecological attributes characterize them; what indicators are more important et cetera.
How to choose the monitoring method depending on the ecological attributes we target, of course but also the context in which we work.
What is sampling and how to organize our work for a better effort : result ratio.
At what cost because this will determine our choices in method, equipment, staffing and so on.
What type of analysis should be chosen?
This will prepare us for the second unit where will go into more detail regarding the statistics applied to ecological monitoring.
Finally the unit will end with a short summary of everything we've seen thus far.
There. Don't forget about the quizzes between the sequences.
They can help you make better progress.
Have an excellent first unit.
