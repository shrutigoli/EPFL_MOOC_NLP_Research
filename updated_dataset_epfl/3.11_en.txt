Welcome back Nature, In Code. 
We're in Chapter three, lecture 11.
In the previous lectures we implemented a JavaScript simulation of genetic drift and we ran multiple simulations at the end and we saw that the key outcome of genetic drift is that we lose genetic variation and we observed that this process seems to happen at a speed that is somehow proportional to the population size.
It seems to happen very quickly in a small population and it seems to be slower in large populations.
In this video, we want to get a bit of a mathematical handle on this process.
Now don't worry if you're not extremely strong in math, we'll just use very basic math here, and you can just follow the reasoning.
Probably best to take a pen and paper and follow me and you'll see you'll have no problems with it.
So we begin by defining a new quantity, which I'm going to call "G" and it's a probability that two alleles are of the same type.
So say you have your population of alleles, now you pick two, are they of the same type, are they both A1A1 or are they both A2A2, and so on.
Are they of the same type?
If yes, that's exactly the probability that two alleles are of the same type.
So this could, for example, be 20% and then in 20% of the cases you pick two alleles, they're of the same type.
Now this will change presumably over time, in the case of genetic drift.
So the question is what happens here?
How does this change over time?
So in particular, how do we go from <i>G</i> in one generation to <i>G</i> in the next generation, which I'm denoting here with this dash.
At the moment, the way we think about this is that we have this very large gametes pool, and it's not exactly infinitely sized but it's a very, very large because we said, well, we can't really have <i>N</i> individuals producing infinite many gametes but they're producing many many gametes, so that's the casting effects won't matter here.
But then when we pick those alleles, those two <i>N</i> alleles, then of course the stochastic effect, a random sampling starts kicking in.
We pick <i>2N</i> alleles, so that we can build the next generation of <i>N</i> individuals and those will then again create a very large gamete pool from which we are going to pick the next generation of <i>2N</i> alleles and so on.
So this is a process, as we have it at the moment.
Another way to put this is if we think about charge that contain our alleles.
Okay so we have a jar here-- it's like your marble jar example.
We have <i>2N</i> allelges here and we would like to generate the generation here which also has <i>2N</i> alleles.
Now we are randomly picking alleles here, but we obviously have to replace them.
We can't just not replace them otherwise we take <i>2N</i> alleles until this is empty and then we have the exact same alleles in here
That's not how it works, right?
How would really works is we take a random allele, we make a copy, put that copy in here, and put the original allele back.
So this is randomly picking with replacement and then we keep doing this, for however many generations we want to.
So here we picked again random alleles, we make copies, put them here, and put the original one back.
And so we can always calculate here, what is our <i>G</i> here in this generation,
<i>G</i> in the next generation,
<i>G</i> in the second generation, and so on.
So what is this relationship exactly?
Well, let's think about this.
So let's look at this <i>G dash</i> here in the first gneration following the original one.
What will be the probability that we actually have two alleles, if we pick two random alleles that are indeed identical, are of the same type.
So there are two ways that this could have happened, the first way is is very simple.
It's basically that you picked the same allele in here twice, physically the same allele, you're actually making two copies of the same allele.
So you pick a random allele, you make a copy, you put it back, you pick again randomly, and you just happen to pick the exact same allele again and you make a copy.
Obviously then there will be of the same type
'cause you picked the same allele.
So the probability of this happening is one over <i>2N</i>.
Why?
Well, the first time you're just going to pick the allele and then the second time the probability that you pick the same allele out of <i>2N</i> alleles is one over <i>2N</i>.
It's just it's frequency.
So that's one way that this could happen.
Another way that this could happen is that you don't pick the same allele twice but you picked two different ones and they just happened to be of the same type.
How can we express this?
Well what is the probability that we don't pick the exact same allele?
Well it's exactly one minus this probability
'cause either you do pick the same allele twice, which happens with probability one over <i>2N</i> or you don't, which happens when one minus two over <i>N</i> because those two need to add up to one.
So that's the probability that 
I'm picking two different alleles, okay, not the same allele here and then I have to multiply this by the probability now that they're actually of the same type and that, if you think about it, is exactly our definition of <i>G</i> right?
The probability that two randomly picked alleles are of the same type.
So these are to two ways that this can come about.
So I need to add those up.
So this is the probability that you picked two alleles and you actually picked twice the same, which happens would probably one over <i>2N</i> or you don't pick the same but they happen to be of the same type.
And so now from this formula we can easily now develop this intuition about the genetic diversity and population size.
So we'll start by defining age, which is yet another variable but don't worry it's simply one minus <i>G</i>.
Remember <i>G</i> was defined as the probability that two alleles are the same, two randomly picked alleles.
Now <i>H</i> is the exact opposite.
It's that the probability that two randomly picked alleles are not the same.
And if you think about it, this is a much better measure of genetic diversity because if genetic diversity is large, which means you pick two random alleles they're likely to be different, than <i>H</i> is going to be large.
And so that's a much better a term.
And correspondingly <i>H dash</i>, so in the next generation simply one minus <i>G dash</i> <i>G</i> in the next generation.
And we know <i>G</i> because we defined this before.
And we know it's one over <i>2N</i> plus one minus one over <i>2N</i> times <i>G</i>.
So now we can say, okay, but we actually want to express <i>H dash</i> so we can simply do this because we know <i>H dash</i> is one minus <i>G dash</i> and <i>G dash</i> is this whole here.
So I'm simply going to replace this term here and I'm going to say, okay it's one over <i>2N</i> plus one minus one over <i>2N</i> times <i>G</i>.
And now I can simplify this term, quite a bit.
So the first thing I'm going to do is
I'm actually going to get rid of these parentheses and because we had a minus in front of these parentheses,
I have to change just sign here and I have to put a minus here.
Good.
The other thing, I'm going to do is 
I'm going to replace this <i>G</i> with one minus <i>H</i> because <i>H</i> is one minus <i>G</i>, right, that means <i>G</i> is one minus <i>H</i> and I want to express everything here in terms of <i>H</i>, and then no more <i>G's</i>.
So I'm going to replace this <i>G</i> simply with one minus <i>H</i> and now, let me just create the product here so that we have all these terms sorted out.
So <i>H dash</i> is going to be one minus one over <i>2N</i>, minus-- then we have one times one is one-- so minus one.
We have one minus <i>H</i>, or one times minus <i>H</i>, which is minus <i>H</i> but we have a minus here so that results in a plus <i>H</i>, then we have minus <i>2N</i> times one, which is obviously minus <i>2N</i>-- one over <i>2N</i> but we have a minus here so we need to change as well.
So plus one over <i>2N</i>.
And then finally we have minus one over <i>2N</i> times minus <i>H</i>, which is <i>H</i> over <i>2N</i> but because we have a minus here we needs to say, minus <i>H</i> over <i>2N</i>.
Good.
So now if you look at this, we can get rid of a couple of terms here, because we have one minus one, so we can get rid of that, one minus one because it's zero.
We have minus one over <i>2N</i> plus one over <i>2N</i>, which also zero, so we can get rid of that as well.
I can get rid of that here and I'm going to get rid of that here and all we're left with is this very simple equation that I'm now going to rewrite.
<i>H dash</i> equals <i>H</i>, okay or plus <i>H</i>, minus <i>H</i> over <i>2N</i>.
I'm going to factor <i>H</i> out.
So we'll have <i>H</i> times one, minus one over <i>2N</i>.
Another way to to put this is usually what you'll see is that people will put this one minus one over <i>2N</i> in front of the <i>H</i> but obviously doesn't matter.
So this is a key formula.
It's amazing actually what kinds of insights we can get from this formula.
Okay, this is now our end result.
Because look at this formula, what does it mean?
Here essentially we're saying, okay, what's the genetic diversity in the next generation?
Well, it's what it was in the previous generation times this term.
And now if you look at this term, right, it's really interesting because the first thing that you observe is that no matter how large <i>N</i> is, you have one minus something, something slightly positive.
So this number is going to be slightly, a bit smaller than one depending on the value of <i>N</i>.
So you already know this is a value between zero and one.
So here you have it already in this very simple formula that it's guaranteed that mathematically speaking the genetic diversity will be reduced, simply because you look at this formula and you see this number is less than one.
So by definition <i>H dash</i> is going to be smaller than <i>H</i> in this generation.
So that's already a profound insight from this very simple formula.
But wait, there's more, there is the fact here that you can actually quantify this reduction in genetic diversity because you have this term here, and as you can see this term will only depend on end <i>N</i>.
If <i>N</i> is very large--
<i>2N</i> is obviously going to be very large, and one over <i>2N</i> is going to be a very small number.
So one minus a very small number will be very close to one, so you'll have a very, very small reduction genetic diversity.
If <i>N</i> is large, okay, then you'll have-- the effects will essentially be weak.
Effects of drift are weak and we know it now.
Why this is the case?
It's because this term will be very, very close to one.
Vice versa if this <i>N</i>, the population sizes are very small, then this term will get relatively smaller and moves away from one over zero.
And so, correspondingly the effect will be much more dramatic.
So if <i>N</i> is small, then the effects of drift will be strong.
So we already knew these two things from simulations.
But now we see it here in this very simple formula.
And I think that's really a strength.
If you know how to do both, then, first of all, you can confirm one with the other, which is always helpful.
But you can also get much better intuition for the whole system.
For example, this system can really very easily express how the effects of genetic drift will depend on the population size and what the effects are in the first place.
On the other hand in the simulations, the stochastic simulations, you could really see how this will actually play out in reality and you saw the stochastic effects playing out over thousands of generations going up and down, and eventually going to fixation.
So I think it's really a strength, if you combine computational reasoning with mathematical reasoning.
Obviously this entire course is about computational reasoning but I occasionally want to bring you back to the mathematical reasoning just to show you that if you can do both, that's really the best of both worlds,
It's not one against the other, they're strongest if they work together.
And so here,
I just wanted to show you that from very simple first principles, you can use this relationship, that immediately shows the effect of genetic drift will be a reduction in genetic variation and it's going to be stronger if the population size is small.
Now that's pretty amazing from such a simple beginning and such a simple formula but actually turns out there's another profound insight about genetic drift that you can use from this formula and we'll take a look at that in the next video.
So this concludes this lecture, a slight excursion into the math of it all.
Very simple, but you saw that from first principles, we can very quickly show that the effect of genetic drift is a reduction in genetic variation and that this crucially depends on the population size when the population size is large, those effects will be weak, when the population size is small, those effects will be strong.
In the next lecture, we look at yet another profound implication that this formula has.
So I'll see you there.
