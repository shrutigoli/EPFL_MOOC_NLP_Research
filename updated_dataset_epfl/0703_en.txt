Hello everyone.
In this video I talk about the tramway revival in France.
What are the strengths of the tram?
What it can promote in terms of use of means of transport and the attractiveness of urban centers.
<I> Since the 1980s, </ i>
<I> new tram networks have flourished throughout Europe, </ i>
<I> over fifty of them. </ I>
<I> The trend was initially shy, </ i>
<I> then it has undergone a much faster pace since the 2000s, </ i>
<I> to the point that it is no exaggeration to speak of real fashion. </ I>
<I> It was in France that this phenomenon was born </ i>
<I> and tram networks have been developed the most </ i>
<I> over the past two decades, </ i>
<I> as the graph shows you on the screen. </ I>
<I> In 1983, there was in France only three tram networks left, </ i>
<I> or rather three tram lines, </ i>
<I> one in Lille, one in Marseille and one in Saint-Etienne. </ I>
<I> There was in 2012, 24 operated networks. </ I>
<I> The first network to have been achieved is the Nantes network, </ i>
<I> which was commissioned in 1985. </ I>
<I> It was followed by the Grenoble network in 1987, </ i>
<I> and the modern tramway, which was developed in ÃŽle-de-France in 1992, </ i>
<I> then in 1994, the Strasbourg network was born. </ I>
<I> It was the first tram networks that have been made in France again. </ I>
<I> I'm going to do again. </ I>
<I> The first networks have been realized are the Nantes network in 1985, </ i>
<I> which you have on the screen, </ i>
<I> followed by the Grenoble monitoring network in 1987, of which you have an illustration. </ I>
<I> Then there was the tram back in ÃŽle-de-France in 1992, </ i>
<I> then in Strasbourg in 1994, and you have here an illustration. </ I>
<I> Why such enthusiasm for the tramway? </ I>
<I> The modern tram, as rebuilt </ i>
<I> in many European cities, </ i>
<I> is part of a double movement. </ I>
<I> The one that first aims to promote the use </ i>
<I> of other means of transport that the car </ i>
<I> as part of everyday life, </ i>
<I> but also on the other hand, the desire to reclassify urban centers </ i>
<I> to make them more attractive to frequent, </ i>
<I> as well as live in. </ I>
<I> Thus in most urban areas </ i>
<I> where it was reintroduced, the tram was accompanied </ i>
<I> by an important urban requalification in the city center </ i>
<I> and a sharing of the road favorable to </ i>
<i> other modes of transport than the car. </ I>
<I> Research on the introduction of a tram </ i>
<I> in a public transport network, </ i>
<I> show that it allows a growing number of users. </ I>
<I> Tram Assets are indeed many for the user: </ i>
<I> a much higher speed than the bus, </ i>
<I> high frequency shift during the day, evening and weekend, </ i>
<I> a smooth ride that allows to use one's travel time </ i>
<I> to deploy activities, provided that we have a seat, </ i>
<I> usually quality foot paths to go to stops </ i>
<I> because of efforts to improve the ergonomics of the public space, </ i>
<I> and finally, easier memorizing the path of the lines </ i>
<I> due to the materialization of the tramway in the public space </ i>
<I> via the rails. </ I>
<I> In France, in many cities </ i>
<I> that have reintroduced trams, </ i>
<I> there is also an increase in the </ i>
<i> number of inhabitants in the city centers. </ I>
<I> On the one hand, it appears that the tram favors </ i>
<I> real estate investments in the city, </ i>
<I> through the redevelopment of public spaces that accompanies it, </ i>
<I> on the other hand, there is also that the tram contributes </ i>
<I> to make more desirable to live in the city </ i>
<I> because the tram limits the dependence on cars </ i>
<I> by the quality of transport service it offers to residents. </ I>
<I> The effect of the introduction of the tram </ i>
<I> on the use of public transport is however very variable. </ I>
<I> Statistics on the use of public transport </ i>
<I> update consequent differences </ i>
<I> according to the considered cities, </ i>
<I> and in particular, these figures show that the increase </ i>
<I> of the number of users five years after commissioning </ i>
<I> of a tram overall a network varies for France between + 18% and + 50%. </ I>
<I> This is what you see for example for a number of cities </ i>
<I> in the table you have before you. </ I>
<I> This suggests that the use of the tram is not mechanical. </ I>
<I> That is to say it is not enough to introduce a tram </ i>
<I> that it is used, </ i>
<i> even if in all agglomerations </ i>
<I> in which it was introduced in France, </ i>
<I> there is an increase in the use of public transport. </ I>
<I> How can we explain these differences in the use of public transport </ i>
<I> following the commissioning of a tram? </ I>
<I> There are a number of factors related to the offer </ i>
<I> and the interaction of the offer with the context </ i>
<I> and the provisions of the resident population in a city </ i>
<I> that explains these differences. </ I>
<I> In the offer, there is first of all the commercial speed, </ i>
<I> following that it is low, 14 to 16 km / h </ i>
<I> or higher, more than 20km / h, </ i>
<I> there are differences in the use of the tram network, </ i>
<I> and more generally of public transport. </ I>
<I> There are also differences depending on the frequency </ i>
<I> if the frequencies are quite low, </ i>
<i> from 8 to 10 minutes, or high, from 3 to 5 minutes. </ I>
<I> This is also a factor which has an influence on the use. </ I>
<I> The fact that the network is unified in its quality, </ i>
<I> that is to say, we offer almost the same frequencies, the same amplitude </ i>
<I> sideboards the evenings and weekends throughout the network, </ i>
<I> or only on the tram network, </ i>
<I> and that therefore there would be a public transport offer of two speeds, </ i>
<I> a high-quality service on tram lines, </ i>
<I> and a lower quality of service on the bus network, </ i>
<I> it also has an impact on the use of public transport. </ I>
<I> Another effect that has an impact on the use of trams: </ i>
<I> is that the lines are saturated </ i>
<I> or do they offer the comfort of a seat, </ i>
<I> This allows using one's time. </ I>
<I> This is particularly the case when using </ i>
<I> public transport during off-peak hours. </ I>
<I> Finally, the link with urban planning and urban development, </ i>
<I> the question is also to know </ i>
<I> if the tram lines that have been developed, </ i>
<I> serve the agglomeration in which the offer was extended, </ i>
<I> completely or only partially. </ I>
<I> Or in other words: how is made the joint </ i>
<I> between the public transport system and urbanization, </ i>
<I> Can we go anywhere with public transport, </ i>
<I> or otherwise, are only </ i>
<I> some parts of the metropolitan area available? </ I>
<I> That is also a factor that plays a central role </ i>
<I> in the greater or lesser use of public transport, </ i>
<I> especially when there is introduction of a tram. </ I>
<I> And of course, last factor that plays a role: </ i>
<I> the issue of reliability. </ I>
<I> Does generaly, schedules are respected. </ I>
You understood through the examples I've shown you, tram networks in France were often allowed to revalue cities and it is even often their main function.
This is the case for example in Bordeaux, a city that is often considered
<I> as exemplary of this view. </ I>
<I> A high quality in the fields </ i>
<i> which have been cited in this video </ i>
<I> makes it possible for people to deploy its lifestyle </ i>
<I> using public transport </ i>
<I> and it makes attractive the attendance of urban spaces, </ i>
<I> whether recreational or for habitat. </ I>
In this sense, the redeployment of tramway networks in France as much about the planning issues that of transportation issues, although of course and as I noted in this video, there is also an interest in the field of transport to develop these infrastructures since in all the cities where these networks have been redeployed, there is an increase in the use of public transport.
