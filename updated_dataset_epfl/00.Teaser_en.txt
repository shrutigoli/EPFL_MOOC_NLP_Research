Ecological monitoring is a key tool in protected areas management. 
It provides information both on the conservation state of the values protected by the area, but also, on the threats these vales are facing. 
Thanks to monitoring, the impacts of our decisions can be assessed, operations can be re-oriented if needed, and results can then be measured. 
Monitoring also helps to better understand ecosystem, thereby equipping managers for the benefits of conservation. 
It involves many stakeholders of the protected area, and improves team cohesion. 
Thanks to ecological monitoring, operations can reported on and decision makers gain responsibility. 
Finally, it is an excellent tool to justify the financial support for particular areas, and to communicate on successes.
This is what this MOOC is all about. 
It is divided in four units. 
Understanding what ecological monitoring is, how it is planned, implemented, assessed and so on. 
Knowing the most treatable principles and statistical methods.
Discovering what techniques to apply depending  on the values that are being monitored. 
Finally, learning from several examples directly to confirm the field that will illustrate everything we see.
