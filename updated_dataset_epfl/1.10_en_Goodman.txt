Well done, you made it through the first week of this course.
During this week, we have seen that communicable diseases such as diarrheal diseases and malaria are a major cause of mortality and morbidity in humanitarian contexts.
Context where the populations particularly at risk, due to various factors such as stress, malnutrition, overcrowding, poor housing and unsanitary conditions.
In order to tackle these diseases, it is crucial to involve various disciplines and specialists.
This multidisciplinary approach is conceptualised in the model of pyramid of health.
In this model, engineers play an important role to stop the transmission of hazards in their environment through the provision of adequate drinking water supply, proper excreta management runoff and waste water disposal, collection and disposal of refuse and effective vector control interventions.
Public health engineering measures focus on putting multiple barriers to prevent the creation of hazards, its transport and the people from being exposed to it once encountered.
In order to do so, public ealth engineers should have a good understanding of the environmental transmission pathways of the diseases.
Such understanding helps to put the appropriate barriers at the right time and at the right place.
For instance remember that faecal oral diseases we have seen with the F-diagram the importance of having adequate sanitation measures, proper hygiene practices and adequate quantity and quality of water to ensure health benefits.
I hope you enjoyed this first week and stay on board with us for the next week to continue to learn how to respond to the needs of people affected by humanitarian crises. See you!
