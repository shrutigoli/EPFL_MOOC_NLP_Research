Now that we have a better sense of how MEAs are set up, letâ€™s talk about a few of the
MEAs that are important for conservation.
One of the key agreements is the Convention on Biological Diversity, or CBD, which Iâ€™ve already mentioned a few times.
The CBD is a framework convention â€“ it creates a broad set of principles and goals for biodiversity conservation as well as structures for international cooperation.
It sets out three key objectives: conservation of biological diversity; the sustainable use of its components; and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the utilization of genetic resources.
Its two protocols provide more detailed obligations relating to some of these objectives.
In 2010, the CBD COP adopted the Strategic
Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, including the Aichi Targets.
The Aichi Targets are specific, measurable goals to be achieved by 2020, across a range of sectors.
For example, Target 11 states: â€œBy 2020, at least 17 per cent of terrestrial and inland water, and 10 per cent of coastal and marine areas, especially areas of particular importance for biodiversity and ecosystem services, are conserved through effectively and equitably managed, ecologically representative and well connected systems of protected areas and other effective area-based conservation measures, and integrated into the wider landscapes and seascapes.â€�
Other targets focus on other biodiversity challenges.
Target 6 addresses management and sustainable use of fisheries.
Target 9 deals with invasive alien species.
Target 20 calls for mobilization of financial resources, while Target 2 aims at integrating biodiversity into development and planning processes.
Letâ€™s look at another agreement.
The Ramsar Convention was adopted two decades before the CBD, in the 1970s.
It focuses on a specific habitat: wetlands.
Ramsar includes general obligations for wise use of all wetlands within a country.
It also establishes a list of wetlands of international importance, to which special management and conservation obligations apply.
The World Heritage Convention also creates a list.
The World Heritage List includes sites of outstanding universal value.
Areas of exceptional natural beauty, outstanding geological formations, significant ecosystems and important natural habitats can all be listed as World Heritage Sites.
It also creates obligations for Parties to protect all cultural and natural heritage in the country, whether or not it is on the
List.
Why would a country want to have a site listed as a Ramsar site or a World Heritage site?
What are the benefits?
There is certainly a reputational benefit, but there are also potential economic benefits â€“ a World Heritage site or Ramsar site might attract more tourism, or more funding support.
Importantly, these international designations do not protect the site by themselves.
Protection of these sites needs to be implemented through national law, for example through designating a site as a protected area, to fulfil international obligations.
CITES â€“ the Convention on International
Trade in Endangered Species â€“ focuses on a different aspect of conservation â€“ addressing international trade in species.
CITES lists species on three Appendices.
For species listed on Appendix I, like the
African Elephant, no international commercial trade is allowed.
This means that any international trade in elephant ivory violates CITES, with a few exceptions, such as for ivory that predates the Convention.
But remember, CITES only works if it is implemented in national law.
Countries must create and enforce laws that prohibit import and export of elephant ivory, and effectively prosecute traffickers who break those laws, for CITES to be effective.
The other two Appendices list species that can be traded with appropriate permits.
Species listed on Appendix II, such as the
Hippopotamus, can only be traded with export and import permits.
For species listed in Appendix III, such as the Civet cat, only an export permit and a certificate of origin are required.
The Appendices are reviewed regularly by the
COP, and species are added and moved.
To stay in compliance, countries must make sure their national laws stay up to date.
One way to do this is to refer directly to
CITES in the national law.
For example, the Tanzania Wildlife Conservation
Act of 2009 states: â€œAny trade in violation of CITES provisions is prohibited under this
Act and all specimens illegally traded shall be confiscated.â€�
And translation into national law is only the starting point: the law has to be enforced.
The Convention on the Conservation of Migratory
Species, or CMS, also includes Appendices listing species, and the species listed under
CMS and those listed under CITES are not same.
CMS creates a framework for agreements and
Memoranda of Understanding among countries where a particular species is found, or range states.
It is intended to support coordination in conservation of transboundary wildlife.
For example, the Gorilla Agreement aims to conserve Gorillas across all ten range states in Africa.
The UN Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational uses of International Watercourses also addresses the problem of conservation of a transboundary resource.
Like CMS, the UN Watercourses Convention creates a framework and principles for agreements among states that share a water basin.
There are other MEAs that we could discuss here, at the global and regional levels.
The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change are particularly relevant.
And there are important regional agreements such as the African Convention on Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources, and regional seas conventions, such as the Barcelona Convention for the Protection of Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean.
