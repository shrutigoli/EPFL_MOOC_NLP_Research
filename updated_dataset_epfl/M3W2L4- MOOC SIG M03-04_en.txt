00:00:31,985 --> 00:00:34,089
Welcome to this lesson
on isovalues curves.

2
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,901
These curves allow to connect

3
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,321
all the points that have identical 
values on the territory.

4
00:00:42,440 --> 00:00:44,926
Indeed, an isoline or an isopleth

5
00:00:45,304 --> 00:00:47,542
is a line that connects points 
of equal value

6
00:00:47,717 --> 00:00:50,017
in a layer of information 
stored most often

7
00:00:50,185 --> 00:00:52,953
in image mode and which represents
a continuous phenomenon.

8
00:00:53,842 --> 00:00:55,679
The production of isolines
generally follows

9
00:00:55,842 --> 00:00:59,101
the interpolation step
for a clearly cartographic purpose.

10
00:00:59,277 --> 00:01:03,514
The aim is to highlight on
the map some areas where at time t,

11
00:01:03,683 --> 00:01:05,751
the temperature is similar for example,

12
00:01:05,913 --> 00:01:09,069
or again where the amount
of precipitation is the same.

13
00:01:10,116 --> 00:01:13,094
The aims of this lesson are
to present the concept of isolines

14
00:01:13,288 --> 00:01:16,038
and to explain how we 
determine the line

15
00:01:16,222 --> 00:01:18,465
from a layer of information 
in image mode.

16
00:01:19,234 --> 00:01:20,984
After following these explanations,

17
00:01:21,195 --> 00:01:23,645
you will be able on one hand
to restore the method

18
00:01:23,805 --> 00:01:25,708
which allows
to draw isovalue curves,

19
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:28,081
and, on the other hand, 
to produce isolines

20
00:01:28,256 --> 00:01:29,979
with the help of QGIS software.

21
00:01:40,194 --> 00:01:43,687
Here are some examples of 
common uses of isolines.

22
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:46,445
To start with, we will 
evoke the contour line

23
00:01:46,635 --> 00:01:48,248
which constitutes a line formed

24
00:01:48,419 --> 00:01:50,769
by the points of the relief 
situated at the same altitude.

25
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:52,821
It is the intersection line

26
00:01:52,986 --> 00:01:55,323
of a horizontal plan with
the relief of the ground.

27
00:01:56,446 --> 00:01:57,934
As we see here in blue,

28
00:01:58,675 --> 00:02:00,525
the closer the contour lines,

29
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:01,664
the steeper the slope.

30
00:02:02,227 --> 00:02:04,139
Between two successive contour lines,

31
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:06,055
we assume that the slope is regular.

32
00:02:06,998 --> 00:02:08,160
The vertical distance

33
00:02:08,338 --> 00:02:11,125
which separates two contour lines
is called the equidistance.

34
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:14,459
On a topographic map,

35
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:17,209
there are two types of contour lines.

36
00:02:17,376 --> 00:02:20,339
The guiding curves, shown here in red,

37
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:22,311
which are also called main curves

38
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,515
or master curves.

39
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:26,879
They are represented by
a thick and continuous line.

40
00:02:27,472 --> 00:02:29,949
They are also described
by an altitude indication.

41
00:02:30,399 --> 00:02:33,624
Their purpose is to facilitate
the reading of altitudes.

42
00:02:34,414 --> 00:02:36,177
We also have standard curves,

43
00:02:36,450 --> 00:02:39,935
some of which are highlighted
here in purple on the screen,

44
00:02:40,505 --> 00:02:43,655
and which are drawn
in continuous fine lines.

45
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:45,734
The contour lines

46
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:47,966
can be used to visualize the topography

47
00:02:48,132 --> 00:02:49,832
from a two-dimensional model.

48
00:02:50,547 --> 00:02:53,097
On the left, the contour 
lines generated

49
00:02:53,262 --> 00:02:54,812
from a digital land model

50
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,270
with a resolution of 25 meters,

51
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:57,357
and on the right,

52
00:02:57,529 --> 00:03:00,729
the plan of contour lines of
the Parc des Buttes Chaumont in Paris.

53
00:03:01,924 --> 00:03:03,387
Without other visual support,

54
00:03:03,863 --> 00:03:06,952
it is the spacing between 
contour lines only

55
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:09,309
which enables to 
account for the relief.

56
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:11,573
In another area,

57
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:13,930
we often have the opportunity
in the weather bulletins,

58
00:03:14,108 --> 00:03:15,995
to follow the path of the isobars,

59
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:19,332
these lines which connect points
of equal atmospheric pressure.

60
00:03:20,089 --> 00:03:23,930
The isobar line allows to identify
meteorological systems,

61
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:27,517
depressions or anticyclones,
and their movements in time.

62
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,128
In the same weather reports,

63
00:03:30,312 --> 00:03:32,800
we often mention the altitude
of the 0 degree isotherm

64
00:03:32,967 --> 00:03:34,317
or the level of freezing.

65
00:03:35,003 --> 00:03:37,791
In France, these maps
are made from raw data

66
00:03:37,965 --> 00:03:40,377
of the US Global Focus System,

67
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:43,996
GFS, with a spatial resolution of
0.25 degrees.

68
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:46,552
We see here on the weather map,

69
00:03:46,724 --> 00:03:50,374
the spatial variation of the 0 degree
isotherm on French territory.

70
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:55,025
And on the right, the map shows
in red the isotherm 10 degrees

71
00:03:55,183 --> 00:03:56,746
the value below which

72
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:59,572
the temperature does not drop
during the hottest month,

73
00:03:59,764 --> 00:04:01,126
here in July,

74
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:04,218
in the definition of the Arctic region.

75
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,440
The isohyets are

76
00:04:06,604 --> 00:04:07,679
imaginary lines

77
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:08,797
which connect the points

78
00:04:08,956 --> 00:04:10,931
which have equal amounts 
of precipitation

79
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:13,052
during a specified period.

80
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,833
And to finish with the examples,

81
00:04:16,999 --> 00:04:18,649
let's mention the geostatistics

82
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:20,559
which we studied in the last lessons.

83
00:04:21,098 --> 00:04:22,654
On the example shown on the screen,

84
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:25,104
the points are houses in the basement 

85
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:28,275
of which measures of the radon
content were made.

86
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:32,106
The pixels have a spatial resolution
of 1,100 meters.

87
00:04:32,687 --> 00:04:34,787
The ten closest neighbors
have been taken into account

88
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,947
for the inference and 
the theoretical model

89
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:40,192
adjusted to the experimental
variogram is Gaussian.

90
00:04:41,987 --> 00:04:45,250
The displayed values ​​express
the becquerel content

91
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:46,115
per cubic meter.

92
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:57,914
The isolines can be produced

93
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,858
from grids of measured values,
or interpolated

94
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:02,838
as we have seen with the 
example of the radon,

95
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:05,926
or then from a triangulated model.

96
00:05:06,207 --> 00:05:08,532
In any case, the isovalue curves

97
00:05:08,704 --> 00:05:12,154
were generated using the linear
interpolation method.

98
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,828
The linear interpolation is
the simplest method

99
00:05:15,993 --> 00:05:17,193
to estimate the value taken

100
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,199
by a continuous function between
two points.

101
00:05:19,606 --> 00:05:21,781
It consists in using an affine function

102
00:05:21,950 --> 00:05:24,912
of the form f (x) = ax + b

103
00:05:25,275 --> 00:05:27,187
going through the two determined points.

104
00:05:28,136 --> 00:05:31,920
For example, if we want
to determine f (2.5),

105
00:05:32,095 --> 00:05:38,458
while we know the values ​​of 
f(2) = 0.75 and f(3) = 0.55, 

106
00:05:39,064 --> 00:05:41,164
the method consists in calculating
the average

107
00:05:41,337 --> 00:05:44,849
of the 2 values ​​knowing that 2.5
is in the middle of the two points.

108
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:46,265
We obtain

109
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:53,531
f(2.5) = 0.75 + 0.55 / 2

110
00:05:53,706 --> 00:05:55,806
so a result of 0.65.

111
00:05:55,970 --> 00:05:58,716
And to draw an isoline for 
the value 0.65

112
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,366
we will determine its location

113
00:06:00,545 --> 00:06:02,920
according to the same principle on
the following segment.

114
00:06:03,986 --> 00:06:05,074
On this regular grid

115
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,540
whose altitude values ​​are located
on the nodes,

116
00:06:07,705 --> 00:06:10,730
we want to create the 
480 meters contour line.

117
00:06:11,585 --> 00:06:13,210
The linear interpolation method

118
00:06:13,397 --> 00:06:15,397
allows to adjust the value 480

119
00:06:15,946 --> 00:06:18,221
on the segments between
the nodes of the grid.

120
00:06:18,758 --> 00:06:20,908
It is a better spatial resolution
of the grid

121
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:24,414
which will result in
a more precise and smoother isoline.

122
00:06:25,386 --> 00:06:27,398
But most GIS softwares

123
00:06:27,567 --> 00:06:30,817
are equipped with algorithms capable
of smoothing isovale curves

124
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:33,810
without changing the spatial
resolution of the basic model.

125
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:36,609
We propose you now to discover

126
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:40,499
how to calculate isovalues with
the help of the QGIS software.

127
00:06:50,981 --> 00:06:52,845
We will extract the contour lines

128
00:06:53,015 --> 00:06:54,365
for the Rochers de Naye region,

129
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,341
located in Switzerland on
the right bank of Lake Geneva.

130
00:06:58,066 --> 00:06:59,216
We have for this region

131
00:06:59,374 --> 00:07:00,999
a very precise digital terrain model,

132
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:03,173
in the form of a raster file

133
00:07:03,373 --> 00:07:05,848
with a spatial resolution 
of 50 centimeters.

134
00:07:07,116 --> 00:07:08,579
To better distinguish the relief,

135
00:07:08,917 --> 00:07:10,129
this model can be displayed

136
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,304
with a shading that can be
calculated with QGIS.

137
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,454
We will begin

138
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:19,781
by extracting the contour line
spaced by 100 meters.

139
00:07:21,186 --> 00:07:24,186
To extract these contour lines
from the numerical model,

140
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,181
we must use the "contour lines" tool

141
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:32,516
in the "raster", "extraction",
"contour lines" drop-down menu.

142
00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:36,394
In the "source file" menu,

143
00:07:37,034 --> 00:07:40,405
we must choose the file corresponding
to our altitude model.

144
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:44,232
Under "output file", for contour lines

145
00:07:44,689 --> 00:07:47,587
we specify the name of the result file

146
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,600
and where we want to save it.

147
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:54,996
Here we call this file 
"courbes_niveau_100m".

148
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:01,042
Next, we have to define the interval 
between the contour lines,

149
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:02,735
100 meters in our case.

150
00:08:04,632 --> 00:08:06,707
Finally, we can give a name

151
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:08,905
to the attribute that will store
the isovalues.

152
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:11,522
In our case it is the altitude.

153
00:08:12,239 --> 00:08:13,877
We can then click on OK.

154
00:08:17,012 --> 00:08:19,462
The curves created are displayed
on the screen.

155
00:08:20,054 --> 00:08:20,842
To see them,

156
00:08:21,264 --> 00:08:23,276
we have to move them over the layer

157
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:24,737
of the digital land model.

158
00:08:26,243 --> 00:08:28,918
In the layer properties, 
on the "style" tab,

159
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:32,041
we will choose to display
the curves in orange.

160
00:08:32,984 --> 00:08:34,846
we will also display a text

161
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:37,247
with the altitude corresponding
to each curve.

162
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:39,152
In the "labels" tab,

163
00:08:39,454 --> 00:08:42,916
we choose to label the layer
with the altitude attribute,

164
00:08:43,093 --> 00:08:45,568
then we choose a font size and color.

165
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:47,832
The contour lines

166
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:50,458
spaced 100 meters apart are displayed
in orange

167
00:08:50,973 --> 00:08:52,510
on the digital altitude model

168
00:08:52,812 --> 00:08:56,399
with a text that indicates
the altitude of each curve.

169
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:02,592
To get a greater precision,

170
00:09:02,805 --> 00:09:05,155
we now extract the contour lines

171
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:06,573
spaced 25 meters apart.

172
00:09:08,231 --> 00:09:14,794
To do this, we use "raster", 
"extraction", "contour lines" again.

173
00:09:15,974 --> 00:09:16,912
Like before,

174
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:20,134
we choose the file corresponding
to our numerical model of altitude,

175
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:23,900
we specify the name of 
the result file

176
00:09:24,083 --> 00:09:26,396
and the location where 
it will be saved,

177
00:09:26,951 --> 00:09:30,363
then we define the spacing of 
the curves, so 20 meters,

178
00:09:30,828 --> 00:09:34,807
and we name the attribute 
of the result "altitude".

179
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:40,149
The new curves created are displayed
on the screen.

180
00:09:40,672 --> 00:09:44,197
In the "properties" tab, 
we will show them in red,

181
00:09:44,356 --> 00:09:47,856
with the text again indicating
the altitude of each curve.

182
00:09:48,799 --> 00:09:51,974
By placing the curves spaced 100 meters 
apart ahead of those of 20 meters,

183
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:55,657
we thus have red contour lines
every 20 meters,

184
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:57,908
and orange curves every 100 meters.

185
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,474
The contour lines are used in particular

186
00:10:03,646 --> 00:10:06,358
to represent altitude on 
Swiss national maps.

187
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,403
On the 1/25,000th card,

188
00:10:09,823 --> 00:10:12,223
the contour lines are spaced 
20 meters apart.

189
00:10:13,496 --> 00:10:17,009
If we display the map at 1/25,000th 
for the region we are interested in,

190
00:10:17,829 --> 00:10:20,916
we can see that the contour lines
on this map

191
00:10:21,411 --> 00:10:24,036
Correspond to curves spaced 
20 meters apart

192
00:10:24,204 --> 00:10:27,379
which we have extracted from
the numerical model of altitude.

193
00:10:37,616 --> 00:10:39,816
The isovalue curves are commonly used

194
00:10:39,992 --> 00:10:41,305
for different applications,

195
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:44,507
in particular the visualization
of the relief with the contour lines,

196
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:46,123
but also in meteorology

197
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,340
with the isobars, the isohyets or
the isotherms.

198
00:10:51,144 --> 00:10:53,019
These isolines can be easily created

199
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,160
by means of the linear interpolation,

200
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,983
on the basis of any grid of
measured or interpolated values.

201
00:11:00,497 --> 00:11:01,872
In the QGIS software,

202
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:04,975
it is the "contour creation" function
in the "raster" menu,

203
00:11:05,184 --> 00:11:08,222
then "extraction", which allows
to implement this operation.

204
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:12,594
This concludes this second week

205
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:14,966
dedicated to continuous 
spatial phenomena.

206
00:11:15,505 --> 00:11:16,405
Next week

207
00:11:16,571 --> 00:11:18,621
we will discuss the numerical models
of altitude.
