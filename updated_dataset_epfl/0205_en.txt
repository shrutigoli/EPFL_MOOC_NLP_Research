Hello.
This video offers an overview of the different techniques of measuring mobility.
We have grouped them into two big families.
Quantitative methods and qualitative methods.
Among the many methods available, we have chosen to present the most used techniques and to focus on the measurement of the mobility of everyday life.
I wish you a good video.
<I> We'll start with the quantitative survey techniques, </ i>
<I> we'll sweep in a series, </ i>
<I> and the first one is the so-called investigations generators. </ I>
<I> The idea is to focus on an equipment, </ i>
<I> an airport, a shopping center, an urban center, </ i>
<I> and to finally interest ourselves in what this pole, that this place </ i>
<I> generates as mobility. </ I>
<I> This is a technique that takes a place to be interested in all streams </ i>
<I> this place has for destination or origin. </ I>
<I> These are techniques that concern all transport means, </ i>
<I> surveys that concern any means of transport in general. </ I>
<I> To give an example, I think that business travel plans </ i>
<I> are an excellent example of these generators investigations. </ I>
<I> For example, the corporate travel plan </ i>
<I> or PDE of the airport of Geneva Cointrin, </ i>
<I> which provides a telephone survey every two to three years, </ i>
<I> within a representative sample of employees, </ i>
<I> that can measure movements made </ i>
<I> by the people working at the airport, </ i>
<I> and their evolution over time, particularly in terms </ i>
<I> of kilometer performance and of mode of transport used. </ I>
<I> The second type of quantitative survey: </ i>
<I> the investigations mobility of people in </ i>
<i> the space of the street, so the street. </ I>
<I> There, it is like for generators investigations, </ i>
<I> we will look at a space, </ i>
<i> for example, a street or a street portion, </ i>
<I> and we will look at all trips </ i>
<I> which are formed in this space. </ I>
<I> The purpose of these surveys is in general </ i>
<I> urban planning or road sharing. </ I>
<I> He finally comes to quantifying flows through transportation means </ i>
<I> on a given area in order to predict and imagine its development. </ I>
<I> Third type of quantitative survey: </ i>
<I> a type which is very developed in public transport, </ i>
<I> it's customer surveys and customer satisfaction. </ I>
<I> The purpose of these surveys is to measure </ i>
<I> user satisfaction of a means of transport </ i>
<I> and measure customer satisfaction in time, </ i>
<I> that is to say, to see if it has changed positively or negatively </ i>
<I> according to a number of criteria. </ I>
<I> So this is somehow dashboard investigations </ i>
<I> for operators. </ I>
<I> To give an example, SBB, the Swiss Railways </ i>
<I> is conducting an ongoing survey in passenger traffic since 1983, </ i>
<I> thus they investigate 2,000 people per month, per phone </ i>
<I> and it allows them to have a highly accurate customer tracking </ i>
<I> it allows them to measure passenger satisfaction </ i>
<I> towards the railway service in Switzerland. </ I>
<I> Fourth type of quantitative survey: traffic counts, </ i>
<I> that can be either automatic or manual. </ I>
<I> When automatic, </ i>
<I> it's just a filament inserted into the pavement </ i>
<I> that allows to count the wheels passing over, </ i>
<I> and when it is manual, is an investigator on the sidewalk </ i>
<I> that counts passing vehicles and and their types. </ I>
<I> So, the type of information collected by these traffic counts, </ i>
<I> is obviously a measure of traffic, possibly by vehicle class, </ i>
<I> possibly by origin. </ I>
<I> It also allows, for example in crossroads, </ i>
<I> to measure the flow volume in different directions. </ I>
<I> Traffic counts are therefore either automatic or manual. </ I>
<I> With regard to the automatic counting, </ i>
<I> you have before you a map of Switzerland with all </ i>
<I> automated counting points of traffic. </ I>
<I> This type of points exist in almost all European countries. </ I>
<I> So this is the example of Switzerland, </ i>
<I> but we could have taken other examples. </ I>
<I> The road counts tend to have developed around the video </ i>
<I> for a number of years. </ I>
<I> The video analysis presents the advantage of being cheaper </ i>
<I> than manual counting or automated counting, </ i>
<I> especially when the traffic is very low or extremely dense, </ i>
<I> and then another advantage, it helps to highlight </ i>
<I> conflicts between different types of vehicles, </ i>
<I> or between transport modes on a given road. </ I>
<I> So this is a technique that is slightly emerging, </ i>
<I> which tends to grow in the recent years, </ i>
<I> at the expense of conventional traffic counts, </ i>
<I> whether automated or manual. </ I>
<I> Other technique of quantitative survey, the surveys cords. </ I>
<I> Here, the idea is to measure the flow of vehicles </ i>
<I> into or out of an area. </ I>
<I> The idea is to collect, for example, </ i>
<I> at the output of a city or agglomeration, </ i>
<I> where cars are coming out from, </ i>
<I> where they are going. </ I>
<I> And in the same way, those who enter, </ i>
<i> where do they come from, </ i>
<I> Where did they go inside the town, </ i>
<I> What are the reasons for moving of these people, </ i>
<I> and then there is also the case of freight traffic, </ i>
<I> what goods enter or leave </ i>
<I> the agglomeration or the considered city. </ I>
<I> The surveys cords are quite heavy to carry because in fact, </ i>
<I> in general, the most common technique is to stop vehicles </ i>
<I> and to distribute questionnaires to circulating people, </ i>
<I> so it generates traffic congestion, </ i>
<I> and therefore the acceptability of this type of survey is not always obvious. </ I>
<I> This is a type of investigation that tends not to develop too much. </ I>
<I> Here you have a methodological example of surveys cords. </ I>
<I> This is the cord-survey of the Lille metropolitan era, </ i>
<I> where you actually see the areas that are considered by the survey. </ I>
<I> So, in blue, you have the cord from Lille, the Lille area, </ i>
<I> in brown, you have the Bethune cord </ i>
<I> and then in green, the cord of the agglomeration of Lens. </ I>
<I> The idea of â€‹â€‹these surveys cords, is to have each time an idea </ i>
<I> finally of the force of mobility exchanges </ i>
<I> between these different parts of town, </ i>
<I> between Lille, Bethune and Lens, </ i>
<I> and between the Lille metropolitan area and its environment, </ i>
<I> that is to say Belgium, if one thinks of the national border, </ i>
<I> and other French regions located nearby. </ I>
<I> Also in the quantitative surveys, </ i>
<I> it is a whole family of surveys that are related </ i>
<I> to the behavior of people on the move. </ I>
<I> So it is the major surveys of mobility. </ I>
<I> Almost in every European country, such surveys are conducted. </ I>
<I> In Switzerland, it is the micro-census transport and mobility, </ i>
<I> in France, on the scale of urban areas, </ i>
<I> it comes to household travel surveys, or EMD. </ I>
<I> At the national level, it is the national transportation survey. </ I>
<I> In Canada, the same type of survey </ i>
<i> is called the origin-destination surveys </ i>
<I> and then, one could multiply examples. </ I>
<I> The surveys also exist in Belgium, they exist in Germany, </ i>
<I> they exist in Britain, in Italy. </ I>
<I> Every time, the objective is the same: </ i>
<I> it is to describe the movements </ i>
<I> of a representative sample of the population in one day. </ I>
<I> This is therefore to collect a number of items on these movements. </ I>
<I> The measurement of the behavior of the population </ i>
<I> on travel is not done only by large surveys. </ I>
<I> There are also ad-hoc specific surveys which are conducted, </ i>
<I> for example on leisure mobility or major mobility. </ I>
<I> These are phenomena that can not be captured </ i>
<I> by large national surveys, </ i>
<I> which are inherently somewhat general and generalistic. </ I>
<I> And so, these ad-hoc specific surveys </ i>
<i> are complementary to major investigations. </ I>
<I> I now propose to be a little </ i>
<i> more specific on these major surveys </ i>
<I> detailing a bit more about their methodologies and their ambitions. </ I>
<I> I suggest you start with the micro-census transport and mobility </ i>
<I> which is the major survey that is conducted in Switzerland every five years, </ i>
<I> So this is a national survey, conducted since the mid-70s. </ I>
<I> It is carried out over a year, that is to say that every day, </ i>
<I> there are a number of people who are surveyed. </ I>
<I> Every day of the year. </ I>
<I> The survey focuses on the permanent resident population aged 6 years and older. </ I>
<I> This is a telephone survey </ i>
<I> which covers all days of the year, </ i>
<I> so including holiday periods and including the weekend. </ I>
<I> In the survey content, </ i>
<I> in micro-census transport </ i>
<I> there are a number of socio-demographic data that are taken. </ I>
<I> A all section on vehicle ownership, </ i>
<I> of driving licenses and subscriptions. </ I>
<I> There's the daily mobility, usually the day before the survey </ i>
<I> and then there are a series of additional questions </ i>
<I> on the occasional mobility, especially on the weekend mobility, </ i>
<I> on vacation. </ I>
<I> Questions were also raised </ i>
<I> on the use of walking and cycling, exercising, </ i>
<I> and there is also a section devoted to issues of opinions </ i>
<I> on transport policy. </ I>
<I> Note an important point since the 2005 survey, </ i>
<I> there is a geo-coding of places of residence </ i>
<I> from the start to the late stages of travels, </ i>
<I> So this basis the micro-census transport really allows </ i>
<I> to have a very accurate assessment of movements in space </ i>
<I> and time in everyday life. </ I>
<I> We have seen very briefly the methodology of the Swiss investigations, </ i>
<I> and so the micro-census transport. </ I>
<I> I now propose that we stop </ i>
<I> a little bit on the French investigations. </ I>
<I> So we will start with EMD, moving household survey. </ I>
<I> So they are investigations conducted on the scale of an urban area. </ I>
<I> They also conducted on a key date </ i>
<I> like the micro-census transportation, </ i>
<I> but there is still a difference with the micro-census transportation </ i>
<I> that is this reference date is a weekday, </ i>
<I> so excluding the weekend. </ I>
<I> The mobility measured, is the mobility from Monday to Friday. </ I>
<I> Another feature of these surveys are conducted face to face, </ i>
<I> so there is an investigator moving from people's homes. </ I>
<I> So we are not on a telephone methodology </ i>
<I> so we have high quality data. </ I>
<I> It should also be noted that the methodology of EMD </ i>
<I> has not changed since the 70s, which is exceptional. </ I>
<I> In most European countries, methods of data collection </ i>
<I> have evolved over time </ i>
<I> and here, we can really have exceptional time series with the EMD, </ i>
<I> which is also making its wealth. </ I>
<I> In addition to the EMD, there is the National Transport Survey </ i>
<I> which is conducted every ten years using a methodology similar </ i>
<I> and that can complete on a national scale </ i>
<I> household travel surveys that relate only to urban areas. </ I>
<I> That's so we came around the methods </ i>
<i> of major quantitative survey. </ I>
<I> Maybe just before going to methods known as qualitative, </ i>
<I> I would like to emphasize that these methods return </ i>
<I> to technics of passation which are very diversified. </ I>
<I> So there is the face to face, which we just talked about, </ i>
<I> about the French household surveys, </ i>
<I> where there is an investigator who is particularly suitable </ i>
<I> to long questionnaires. </ I>
<I> It provides very good reliability of responses </ i>
<I> but it's often difficult to reach people, </ i>
<I> appointments are hard to take, </ i>
<I> and then corollary of the fact that there is an investigator who is moving from home to home, </ i>
<I> it is usually surveys with a very high cost. </ I>
<I> There are also surveys that are conducted by telephone. </ I>
<I> So, telephone surveys, </ i>
<I> this is for example the case of the micro-census Swiss transport. </ I>
<I> The transfer is much faster. It costs less. </ I>
<I> But the duration of the poll is more limited than face to face. </ I>
<I> The reliability of control, even if  progress has been made, </ i>
<I> is lower as well as at the face-to-face </ i>
<I> and then we have the sample selection problems </ i>
<I> since there are more and more people </ i>
<i> that are either out of the directory </ i>
<I> or which have no fixed telephone equipment, </ i>
<I> so we have representativeness problems </ i>
<I> with telephone surveys. </ I>
<I> Third type of survey, the surveys said epistolary </ i>
<I> where we send a questionnaire to the home of a sample of the population </ i>
<I> then asked them to fill them </ i>
<I> and to send them back. </ I>
<I> The questionnaires can be long, the survey is inexpensive, </ i>
<I> but the problem of this type of survey, </ i>
<I> is that the non-response rates are extremely high, </ i>
<I> and then, there is no possible exchange between an interviewer and an interviewee, </ i>
<I> as for example in a telephone survey </ i>
<I> or an inquiry face to face. </ I>
<I> That can sometimes lead to misunderstandings </ i>
<I> or misunderstandings of certain questions. </ I>
<I> And then finally, the last type of investigation at the handover, </ i>
<I> the internet surveys, </ i>
<I> they tend to grow a lot in recent years. </ I>
<I> They allow quick returns </ i>
<I> but they have problems of representativeness, </ i>
<I> they have average response rates. </ I>
<I> It is very difficult to ensure that a person </ i>
<I> did not respond repeatedly to the same survey, </ i>
<I> so it is clear that the costs are low </ i>
<I> but the quality is sometimes a little limited </ i>
<I> if you did not quite elaborate devices of control and plausibility. </ I>
<I> We have seen in detail the quantitative surveys. </ I>
<I> I now propose to speak about qualitative surveys. </ I>
<I> This is the second large family of investigations. </ I>
<I> They are not intended to count but they are aimed more to understand. </ I>
<I> As such, there is a precision that immediately must be made, </ i>
<I> it is that sometimes we have the feeling that quantitative surveys </ i>
<I> are - quotations marks - "more scientific" because there are numbers, </ i>
<I> because they give results that can be quantified. </ I>
<I> I would like to stress that qualitative surveys </ i>
<I> are no less scientific, simply, they have another aim. </ I>
<I> Here, the aim is not to quantify behaviors but to understand them. </ I>
<I> So this is really to understand the springs travels, </ i>
<I> to understand the how and why. </ I>
<I> There are a number of these qualitative surveys, </ i>
<I> of these qualitative survey techniques. </ I>
<I> The most common is that the interviews are carried </ i>
<I> to measure the mobility of comprehensive surveys, </ i>
<I> face to face or in a group, </ i>
<I> it can be more or less structured interviews, </ i>
<I> so it can be quite directive in order to understand really </ i>
<I> a given behavior in a given situation. </ I>
<I> So we will ask questions in relation to this specific situation, </ i>
<I> it can be much less directive, </ i>
<I> like for example surveys using methodologies </ i>
<I> like life stories </ i>
<I> where we try to understand the youth of certain behaviors, </ i>
<I> eg automobile related matters </ i>
<I> related to the life story of the person concerned. </ I>
<I> Qualitative surveys can also be comments, </ i>
<I> field observations, </ i>
<I> comments that may be participating or not participating. </ I>
<I> So, for example, an observation by an investigator </ i>
<I> on a crossroad of the cohabitation of all road users, </ i>
<I> it can be a non-participant observation </ i>
<I> in that it does not intervene, </ i>
<I> simply, it measures, it notes a number of behaviors, </ i>
<I> of conflicts of use. </ I>
<I> But the observation can also be participating, </ i>
<I> in the sense that the investigator may intervene </ i>
<i> in the observation </ i>
<I> to ask additional questions </ i>
<I> to be sure he understands what he saw. </ I>
<I> More and more observation techniques </ i>
<I> call for video and photo, </ i>
<I> which obviously helps to have a look perhaps more precise. </ I>
<I> It can also be video or photo, a nice backing </ i>
<I> to make interviewees talk </ i>
<I> that we might have observed on their practices. </ I>
<I> Last type of qualitative survey, </ i>
<I> which is used in the field of mobility, </ i>
<I> the monographs, these are surveys </ i>
<I> that address a community, a territory or a family. </ I>
<I> This is often quite lengthy investigations </ i>
<I> or at least taking into account the long time. </ I>
<I> To give an example, monographs could be made </ i>
<I> of Defence Associations of road users </ i>
<I> or promotion of public transport. </ I>
<I> So there it would describe the youth of these associations, </ i>
<I> the way they acted, their motivations, </ i>
<I> how they have evolved over time. </ I>
<I> This is valid for a very large number of players, </ i>
<I> who can be finally considered in that way, </ i>
<I> whether they are public bodies or private actors </ i>
<I> or associative actors. </ I>
<I> The monograph, it can also be practiced on territory </ i>
<I> to make a monograph of the transport policy in a given agglomeration </ i>
<I> and remake the history of decisions that those decisions produced. </ I>
<I> This is also a qualitative monographic approach </ i>
<I> which provides information on transport and mobility policies. </ I>
<I> To end the qualitative surveys, </ i>
<i> I still wanted to emphasize their roles </ i>
<I> to finally impress to what they can be used for </ i>
<I> compared to quantitative surveys </ i>
<I> which are largely dominant in the field of mobility. </ I>
<I> The qualitative surveys enable truly comprehension. </ I>
<I> When we make a number of quantitative findings, </ i>
<I> for example the explosion of long-distance commuting, </ i>
<I> to give this example, </ i>
<I> or the development of dual residence. </ I>
<I> We can measure it, we can say here, it evolves, it grows, </ i>
<I> it generates a number of traveled kilometers </ i>
<I> by various means of transport </ i>
<I> but it does not give us the keys to understanding, </ i>
<I> we know how to quantify with a quantitative survey, </ i>
<I> but you may not understand what's behind it, </ i>
<I> finally, the phenomenon in question. </ I>
<I> This is what the qualitative surveys allow, </ i>
<I> to understand why we commute on a long distance </ i>
<I> instead of ... why we are not moving, </ i>
<I> why we accept two </ i>
<i> hours of travel to work, </ i>
<I> why we do not move closer to our place of work. </ I>
<I> That is a qualitative survey that allows you to answer </ i>
<I> to a question of this type. </ I>
<I> The qualitative surveys, in this way, are extremely useful </ i>
<I> to specify quantitative survey results </ i>
<I> and thus in combination with quantitative methods. </ I>
<I> In the area of â€‹â€‹mobility, </ i>
<I> mixed surveys, quantitative qualitative </ i>
<I> probably have a great future because they allow exactly </ i>
<I> both the quantized description of phenomena </ i>
<I> and the understanding of these phenomena in very fine terms. </ I>
<I> Qualitative methods and quantitative methods </ i>
<I> are actually quite largely complementary, </ i>
<I> As you can see on this slide, </ i>
<i> which resumes </ i>
<I> the main features of these two great techniques. </ I>
We arrive at the end of this overview of measurement techniques of mobility.
Hope it has not stunned you too much.
You have seen the great diversity of techniques that are available to measure daily mobility.
This diversity is truly a toolbox in which we will draw the technique or combination of techniques which is the most appropriate to answer the question that arises.
This is the message that we wanted to pass you in this video, to each question its combination of measurement techniques.
Thank you for your attention.
