Hi, in this video Emily Eros from the American Red Cross is talking about the ways to make the use of technology more sustainable in the context of the Missing Map Project that you saw in Chapter 2.
So, we go to different countries, we train people, we leave technology behind, but when there's not a continued presence, and say we just did a two week trip, it's hard to expect people to keep mapping and keep engaged after the fact.
So right now we're doing our biggest project to date in the border areas of Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.
We're mapping all the communities within 15 kilometers of that international border, and that works out to be an area about the size of Switzerland, so there's thousands of communities, we have over a hundred volunteers traveling into them, and because it's such a large project we wanted to think about how we can provide some more support to that locally.
And also how can we try to do something more sustainable than just coming in, bringing technology, doing mapping, and then leaving again.
So we've built what we call a hub, in GuÃ©ckÃ©dou, Guinea, and it's a physical office space, staffed with three local staff, five actually, local staff, and an expat, and they do community presentations, they do basic computer skills training, and other ways that they can use technology to really just give back, and they're also our basis that we use to operate the mapping project.
So this is an attempt for us to kind of have a local presence where we can engage with the community in a longer term kind of way, and also engage with other organizations and the government on the ground so that we can have a two-way dialogue and try to make the data more useful.
Focusing on making the data more useful.
So we do produce maps, we do share them with the Red Cross, but we want to look for other local partners who are able to make use of data and make sure that they know it exists.
