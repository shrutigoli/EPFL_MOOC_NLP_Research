00:00:22,869 --> 00:00:26,788
Welcome to this lesson on the
geo-referencing of images.

2
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:30,667
The images and rasters must be positioned

3
00:00:30,867 --> 00:00:33,441
in the right place in a
geographic information system

4
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:35,388
to be used correctly.

5
00:00:36,775 --> 00:00:39,758
The objective of this lesson
is to familiarize yourself

6
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:44,077
with the principles and the
practice of the geo-referencing of images

7
00:00:44,277 --> 00:00:47,277
so that at the end you are able

8
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:50,477
to geo-reference an image or manipulate

9
00:00:50,677 --> 00:00:53,340
the geo-referencing parameters
of these images.

10
00:00:54,190 --> 00:00:56,991
<i> During the lesson,
we will discuss successively </ i></i>

11
00:00:57,191 --> 00:00:59,641
<i> about the geo-referencing
problem, </ i></i>

12
00:01:00,203 --> 00:01:02,778
<i> a brief description
of this problem, </ i></i>

13
00:01:03,016 --> 00:01:07,159
<i> the methodology used
to geo-reference an image, </ i></i>

14
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:10,617
<i> an example of application,
how </ i></i>

15
00:01:10,817 --> 00:01:14,342
<i> geo-referencing is done
with the QGIS software </ i></i>

16
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,230
<i> and finally, how to store,
how to save </ i></i>

17
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,912
<i> the characteristic
parameters of a geo-reference. </ I></i>

18
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:30,551
<i> Let's start with the problematic </ i></i>

19
00:01:30,751 --> 00:01:34,751
<i> which is that of an image
inherited from an external source </ i></i>

20
00:01:34,951 --> 00:01:36,621
<i> for example an old scanned card </ i></i>

21
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:41,737
<i> or an aerial photograph
whose reference coordinates have been lost, </ i></i>

22
00:01:41,937 --> 00:01:44,937
<i> so an ordinary image
devoid of any spatial reference </ i></i>

23
00:01:45,137 --> 00:01:49,068
<i> that we wish to integrate into
a geographic information system. </ I></i>

24
00:01:49,268 --> 00:01:51,545
<i> To do this, it is necessary
to be able to place it in the right place </ i></i>

25
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:57,317
<i> so to reconstitute the corresponding
spatial reference system. </ I></i>

26
00:02:07,006 --> 00:02:09,508
<i> The operation is perfomed
in two steps. </</i>

27
00:02:09,708 --> 00:02:12,467
<i> First, we will identify
a series of points </ i></i>

28
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:15,667
<i> common to the image and
to a reference map </ i></i>

29
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:19,211
<i> on which this image
has to integrate. </ I></i>

30
00:02:19,411 --> 00:02:23,534
<i> And subsequently,
we will modify, transform the image </ i></i>

31
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:26,160
<i> move it, rotate it, change its
scale </ i></i>

32
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:29,697
<i> to adjust it to the reference map. </ I></i>

33
00:02:31,210 --> 00:02:33,079
<i> We need at least
three control points, </ i></i>

34
00:02:33,279 --> 00:02:34,078
<i> if possible more, </ i></i>

35
00:02:34,278 --> 00:02:36,431
<i> they should be easy to identify </ i></i>

36
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:39,949
<i> both on the map and
in the starting image. </ I></i>

37
00:02:40,149 --> 00:02:43,149
<i> And these points should
be spread if possible </ i></i>

38
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:45,908
<i> throughout the area that
has to be geo-referenced </ i></i>

39
00:02:46,108 --> 00:02:51,109
<i> so that the deformation
of the image is approximately ... </ i></i>

40
00:02:51,359 --> 00:02:53,021
<i>so that it is well
distributed let's say </ i></i>

41
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:56,790
<i> and that there is no singularity. </ i></i>

42
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,796
<i> This geometrical transformation
is composed of a translation </ i></i>

43
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:03,343
<i> of a scaling and a rotation, </ i></i>

44
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:07,693
<i> all of these operations
characterizing a Helmert transformation </ i></i>

45
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:09,392
<i> or an affine transformation. </ I></i>

46
00:03:09,592 --> 00:03:12,592
<i> There are other types
of possible transformations, </ i></i>

47
00:03:12,792 --> 00:03:15,152
<i> in particular polynomial
transformations </ i></i>

48
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:17,290
<i>of the first, second or third order, </ i></i>

49
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:20,897
<i> the use of spleens or
projections. </ I></i>

50
00:03:21,097 --> 00:03:24,097
<i> All these approaches
are less frequent. </ I></i>

51
00:03:24,297 --> 00:03:30,294
<i> They are especially useful when
the starting map is not very regular </ i></i>

52
00:03:30,494 --> 00:03:33,494
<i> and that the deformation
can take into account </ i></i>

53
00:03:33,694 --> 00:03:36,156
<i> some local particularities </ i></i>

54
00:03:36,356 --> 00:03:39,312
<i> to allow very
specific adjustments </ I></i>

55
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:44,322
<i> Most of the time, however, we
will use a Helmert transformation. </ I></i>

56
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:51,331
<i> Who says change of scale and
rotation also says new grid </ i></i>

57
00:03:51,594 --> 00:03:55,846
<i> for which the value
of each pixel must be evaluated, </ i></i>

58
00:03:56,046 --> 00:03:59,971
<i> so resampling the starting grid. </ I></i>

59
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:04,711
<i> This resampling can use the
nearest neighbor approach </ i></i>

60
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:08,595
<i> where we simply take the value </ i></i>

61
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,649
<i> of the nearest original map cell. </ I></i>

62
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:14,776
<i> Resampling by the
nearest neighbor method </ i></i>

63
00:04:14,976 --> 00:04:18,309
<i> is the one that best
respects the original image </ i></i>

64
00:04:18,509 --> 00:04:22,467
so the one that will reduce
the contrasts

65
00:04:22,667 --> 00:04:24,199
<i> of the original image the least. </ I></i>

66
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:28,503
<i> The bi-linear bi-cubic
approach is sometimes useful </ i></i>

67
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:31,703
<i> if the move, the scale
change </ i></i>

68
00:04:31,903 --> 00:04:34,074
<i> or the rotation are important </ i></i>

69
00:04:34,274 --> 00:04:38,297
<i> and that the image
in fact ... would become little readable </ i></i>

70
00:04:38,497 --> 00:04:40,109
<i> because of the transformation. </ I></i>

71
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:51,532
Let's now take a concrete example </ i>

72
00:04:51,732 --> 00:04:54,126
<i>of how geo-referencing
is practiced </ i></i>

73
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:55,803
<i> with the QGIS software. </ I></i>

74
00:04:56,003 --> 00:04:57,768
<i> So in QGIS, </ i></i>

75
00:04:57,968 --> 00:05:00,968
<i>we will open
the geo-referencing tool </ i></i>

76
00:05:01,168 --> 00:05:05,847
<i> and in this tool, we will
import the image to geo-reference </ i></i>

77
00:05:06,047 --> 00:05:09,047
<i> in this case, an old map of Mahé. </ I></i>

78
00:05:09,247 --> 00:05:12,247
<i> We are asked to specify
the system of references </ i></i>

79
00:05:12,447 --> 00:05:14,207
<i> the system of projections
of references </ i></i>

80
00:05:14,407 --> 00:05:17,491
<i> which must be the same
as the projection system of the map. </ I></i>

81
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:21,887
<i>Then, we will add the control
points, </ i></i>

82
00:05:22,087 --> 00:05:25,337
<i> a first point on Pointe Matoopa </ i></i>

83
00:05:26,512 --> 00:05:30,668
<i> to the West of Mahé and
then a second point </ i></i>

84
00:05:30,868 --> 00:05:34,368
<i>to the North-East on
Pointe Machabée, </ i></i>

85
00:05:42,156 --> 00:05:47,028
<i> a third point near the airport, </ i></i>

86
00:05:53,544 --> 00:05:57,028
<i> a fourth point to
the South of the island </ i></i>

87
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:08,015
<i> and a last point
to the South-West at Pointe Lazare. </ I></i>

88
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:16,067
<i> When we start the
geo-referencing operation, </ i></i>

89
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:20,546
<i> the system asks us to specify
the parameters of this transformation. </ I></i>

90
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:23,908
<i> We choose in this case amongst
the types of transformation </ i></i>

91
00:06:24,108 --> 00:06:25,703
<i> the Helmert transformation, </ i></i>

92
00:06:25,903 --> 00:06:29,852
<i>a resampling by the nearest neighbors </ i></i>

93
00:06:30,052 --> 00:06:33,641
<i> and then we specify
the output file </ i></i>

94
00:06:33,866 --> 00:06:37,057
<i> so a tif image file </ i></i>

95
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:41,974
<i> that will simply
have the starting file name </ i></i>

96
00:06:42,174 --> 00:06:43,920
<i> plus the word which is Georef. </ I></i>

97
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,101
<i> We must also specify the
projection system released </ i></i>

98
00:06:49,301 --> 00:06:51,820
<i> so in this case,
we worked with Mercator web </ i></i>

99
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,971
<i> both for the starting map, </ i></i>

100
00:06:55,171 --> 00:06:58,171
<i> the imported map
and the resulting map. </ I</i>

101
00:06:58,371 --> 00:07:03,199
<i> We start the operation
and before closing, </ i></i>

102
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:06,399
<i> we are still asked
to save the adjustment points, </ i></i>

103
00:07:06,599 --> 00:07:08,406
<i> the control points
that have been defined. </ I></i>

104
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:12,772
<i> And we see that this map
was actually added </ i></i>

105
00:07:12,972 --> 00:07:15,255
to the geographic information system.

106
00:07:15,455 --> 00:07:18,455
<i> We can modify its transparency
in the properties </ i></i>

107
00:07:18,655 --> 00:07:20,334
<i> to note that indeed </ i></i>

108
00:07:20,534 --> 00:07:24,514
<i> this map-image is now
placed in the right place. </ I></i>

109
00:07:24,714 --> 00:07:28,152
<i> And by reviewing the various
control points, </ i></i>

110
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:33,736
<i> we can see that the adjustment
is not of such poor quality.</ I></i>

111
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:41,117
<i> A little bit of approximation
here on the side of Baie Lazare... </ i></i>

112
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,170
<I> But overall,
the adjustment is fairly accurate. </ I>

113
00:07:57,412 --> 00:08:01,015
<i> Now let's see the parameters
that define </ i></i>

114
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,462
<i> the transformation and
how to store them. </ I></i>

115
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:06,662
<i> As I said earlier,
a Helmert transformation </ i></i>

116
00:08:06,862 --> 00:08:08,399
<i> is an affine transformation, </ i></i>

117
00:08:08,599 --> 00:08:11,566
<i> that is to say a transformation
which can be described </ i></i>

118
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:16,752
<i> by a linear combination
of the x y coordinates, </ i></i>

119
00:08:16,952 --> 00:08:18,624
<i> of the starting system.
So each coordinate </ i></i>

120
00:08:18,824 --> 00:08:21,733
<i> of the arrival system,
x' y' here, </ i></i>

121
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:24,180
<i> is expressed as a
linear combination </ i></i>

122
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:31,517
<i> of the x y starting coordinates and
then from a constant term. </ I></i>

123
00:08:31,717 --> 00:08:34,394
<i> This system actually includes
6 parameters </ i></i>

124
00:08:34,594 --> 00:08:37,267
<i> which are grouped together
in what is called a World File </ i></i>

125
00:08:37,482 --> 00:08:40,794
<i> describing in fact
the geo-referencing of an image. </ I></i>

126
00:08:40,994 --> 00:08:43,574
<i> And in this World File,
these parameters are presented </ i></i>

127
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:48,163
<i> in the order described
below with first the pixel size </ i></i>

128
00:08:48,363 --> 00:08:50,335
<i> according to the x-axis, </ i></i>

129
00:08:50,535 --> 00:08:54,600
<i> then the 2 rotation parameters
around the y-axis and the x-axis, </ i></i>

130
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,380
<i> the size of the pixel
according to y, </ i></i>

131
00:08:57,580 --> 00:09:00,580
<i> and then finally
the coordinates, the constant terms, </ i></i>

132
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:05,780
<i> the x y coordinates of the pixel center
located on the top left of the image. </ I></i>

133
00:09:05,992 --> 00:09:11,988
<i> So we see that if
we define the position </ i></i>

134
00:09:12,188 --> 00:09:14,238
<i> from the top left of the image, </ i></i>

135
00:09:14,438 --> 00:09:18,147
<i> the cell size of the grid </ i></i>

136
00:09:18,347 --> 00:09:20,890
<i> and then the rotation elements, </ i></i>

137
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:24,845
<i> we can actually position
an image precisely </ i></i>

138
00:09:25,045 --> 00:09:26,895
<i> in a geographic information
system. </ I></i>

139
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,988
<i> In the example here to the
right, </ i></i>

140
00:09:30,188 --> 00:09:32,559
<i> when we have square
pixels and no rotation, </ i></i>

141
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,636
<i> the angular terms are nil. </ I></i>

142
00:09:34,836 --> 00:09:39,668
<i> And finally, the calculation
of the coordinates of each point </ i></i>

143
00:09:39,868 --> 00:09:43,280
<i> at the center of each
pixel is quite simple. </ I></i>

144
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:48,017
<i> In the case where the transformation
includes a rotation component, </ i></i>

145
00:09:48,217 --> 00:09:52,030
<i> we see that in fact
the D and B parameters </ i></i>

146
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:54,365
<i> are not in fact angles
of rotation </ i></i>

147
00:09:54,565 --> 00:09:57,560
<i> but represent the components
according to x and y </ i></i>

148
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,827
<i> of the width and height
of the pixel. </ I></i>

149
00:10:00,027 --> 00:10:03,661
<i> And it is therefore more
accurate to talk about components </ i></i>

150
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:09,877
<i> according to x and y, of projections
rather than angular terms. </ I></i>

151
00:10:10,077 --> 00:10:14,255
<i> Afterwards, the calculations become
more complicated if the pixel is not square </ i></i>

152
00:10:14,455 --> 00:10:18,229
<i> but that it has different dimensions
according to y and according to x. </ I></i>

153
00:10:18,842 --> 00:10:21,429
<i> These various parameters
can be stored </ i></i>

154
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:24,629
<i> in an accompanying file,
the World File precisely, </ i></i>

155
00:10:24,829 --> 00:10:30,392
<i> with the rule that the
accompanying file has the same name </ i></i>

156
00:10:30,592 --> 00:10:33,592
<i> as the base file and
an extension that depends </ i></i>

157
00:10:33,792 --> 00:10:36,392
<i> on the image format,
tfw for the tif </ i></i>

158
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:39,992
<i> and jgw for the jpeg,
pgw for the png </ i></i>

159
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:41,815
<i> gfw for the gif. </ I></i>

160
00:10:42,227 --> 00:10:45,015
<i> Or, the second possibility, </ i></i>

161
00:10:45,215 --> 00:10:48,777
<i> store these information in the header
of an image file in .tif format </ i></i>

162
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,998
<i> And we talk here about
GEOTIFF format </ i></i>

163
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:52,980
<i> since it is a single file </ i></i>

164
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:55,380
<i> that contains
the geo-referencing information, </ i></i>

165
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:57,073
<i> so an image that intrinsically </ i></i>

166
00:10:57,314 --> 00:10:59,627
<i> contains the
geo-referencing information. </ I></i>

167
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:03,894
<i> The GeotiffExamine utility
that is free to access </ i></i>

168
00:11:04,094 --> 00:11:07,914
<i> makes it easy
to check if a TIFF file has </ i></i>

169
00:11:08,114 --> 00:11:10,163
<i> the geo-referencing information </ i></i>

170
00:11:10,363 --> 00:11:13,216
<i> and, if so, generates
a World File </ i></i>

171
00:11:13,416 --> 00:11:15,360
<i> or conversely, when
we have the World File, </ i></i>

172
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,284
<i> to fill in
the header of the TIFF file </ i></i>

173
00:11:18,484 --> 00:11:20,364
<i> to transform a TIFF into
Geotiff. </ I></i>

174
00:11:20,564 --> 00:11:25,077
<i> We see for example that if we
look for the geo-referenced file </ i></i>

175
00:11:25,277 --> 00:11:28,277
<i> that we have just made and that
we open this file </ i></i>

176
00:11:28,477 --> 00:11:30,676
<i> with this utility, </ i></i>

177
00:11:30,876 --> 00:11:35,876
<i> we see that the
geo-referencing parameters </ i></i>

178
00:11:36,076 --> 00:11:38,959
<i> are stored with the file itself </ i></i>

179
00:11:39,159 --> 00:11:41,712
<i> and we can make
the corresponding World File. </ I></i>

180
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,541
<i> As mentioned earlier,
this World File has the tfw extension </ i></i>

181
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:50,343
<i> and if you open it with
a simple text software, </ i></i>

182
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:54,622
<i> we find the 6 parameters
that characterize </ i></i>

183
00:11:54,822 --> 00:11:59,607
<i>the geometric transformation and
the positioning of the image. </ I></i>

184
00:12:00,082 --> 00:12:03,418
<i> The extension of this file,
of this World File </ i></i>

185
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,653
<i> can be changed to jgw </ i></i>

186
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:12,543
<i> and the transformed name
by removing the Georef suffix </ i></i>

187
00:12:12,743 --> 00:12:15,480
<i> so that we can see
that we can now import </ i></i>

188
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:18,527
<i> the original jpeg file using </ i></i>

189
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:21,302
<i>the geo-referencing information </ i></i>

190
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:24,460
<i> that was generated later. </ I></i>

191
00:12:26,897 --> 00:12:28,760
<i> That is it. It is simple. </ I></i>

192
00:12:52,532 --> 00:12:54,128
So, we are reaching the end of this lesson

193
00:12:54,328 --> 00:12:57,328
which has allowed us to review the principles

194
00:12:57,528 --> 00:12:59,683
and the practice of image geo-referencing

195
00:12:59,883 --> 00:13:04,857
and to see how we can manipulate,
record and manipulate

196
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:09,275
the referencing parameters in image files

197
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:11,205
or in accompanying files.
