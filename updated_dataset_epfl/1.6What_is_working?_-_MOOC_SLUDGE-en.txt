Is city wide faecal sludge management just a pipe dream?
Like anything that is accomplished at a city wide scale, faecal sludge management requires planning and management for a sustainable implementation.
But at the same time, we need to think of steps to start taking now.
We can't wait for years until a city wide sanitation plan has been developed and implemented, and find a way to fully fund it, then wait to get buyin from all the stake holders...
We can't wait for all that before we start to take the first step.
So in this module, I'm going to share with you now what's currently working in 3 different cities.
Following this model, you'll be able to distinguish differences in faecal sludge management among the 3 presented cities and identify examples of what is and is not working in the service chain of each city.
In faecal sludge management, we are coming up with solutions for existing cities and for the current situation.
So we need to be able to adapt to the specific local situation and most likely no 2 solutions will look the same.
We need to distinguish between solutions we can start to implement now to manage the current sludge crises
And the most optimal and sustainable solutions that we can continue to strive towards in the future.
<i>In this model, I'm going to focus on Hanoi, Vietnam,</i>
<i>Kampala, Uganda, and
Toyokawa, Japan.</i>
<i>I will introduce you to the current reality</i>
<i>of how faecal sludge management is evolving in different regions.</i>
<i>And what is working in these cities</i>
<i>that is better than many other cities.</i>
<i>But what are still some of the remaining challenges?</i>
Vietnam, is a unique situation.
Since 1996, the building code has stipulated that any new construction includes septic tanks.
In Hanoi, the access to improved sanitation is greater than 95%.
So the building code requires septic tanks but, it does not account for the emptying of faecal sludge which is also the reason, public entities do not have strategies in place to manage it.
<i>In fact, septic tanks are typically constructed under the house</i>
<i>without access.</i>
<i>And so a hole needs to be made in the floor of the kitchen</i>
<i>to access the tank if sludge is going to be removed.</i>
<i>This is what it looks like.</i>
<i>After several years of operation,</i>
<i>sludge accumulates in septic tanks.</i>
<i>If it is not removed, it results in emergency situations</i>
<i>such as toilets backing up into houses.</i>
<i>This demand has resulted in private emptying transportation companies</i>
<i>springing up to meet this need.</i>
<i>In Hanoi, there are now over 40 private companies</i>
<i>with over 100 trucks.</i>
<i>So far, it sounds reasonably efficient and effective</i>
<i>for faecal sludge management, right?</i>
<i>Everyone has septic tanks, there's tons of companies and trucks</i>
<i>running around to empty them.</i>
<i>The law originally didn't plan for that.</i>
<i>The private industry stepped in and filled the role.</i>
<i>But unfortunately, that's not exactly the whole picture.</i>
<i>What happens to the faecal sludge after it's emptied?</i>
<i>Collection and transport companies are official</i>
<i>and legally registered companies.</i>
<i>And they have the right to empty septic tanks</i>
<i>but they do not actually have the right to discharge that sludge.</i>
<i>In fact, that's because there's no designated place</i>
<i>within the city, for these private companies to discharge.</i>
<i>So the service chain just stops there</i>
<i>and the trucks just dump the sludge wherever they can find a place.</i>
<i>So virtually all the faecal sludge</i>
<i>ends up directly in the environment.</i>
<i>This is illustrated in the shift flow diagram of Hanoi</i>
<i>prepared by SANDEC.</i>
<i>It shows in green, what percentage of excreta in the city</i>
<i>is safely managed.</i>
<i>And in red, what percentage is unsafely managed.</i>
However, as of last year, there is a new decree in place for the regulation of sludge.
And faecal sludge, is specifically mentioned as one type of sludge in this decree.
Changes are not yet apparent but this obviously takes some time to figure out after instituting the legal framework.
It is very positive, that the Vietnamese government has officially recognised the need to manage faecal sludge.
And now, people understand the importance at a political level.
Certainly, with such a strong government structure, changes will start to happen.
Okay. And now, moving to Uganda.
Most people in Kampala also have access to a toilet.
<i>However, that may mean
30 people are sharing it</i>
<i>and it's not actually clean enough to be used.</i>
<i>Around 80% of the population are served by on site systems.</i>
<i>Of these, 70% are pit latrines.</i>
<i>About half lined, and half unlined.</i>
<i>And the other 30% are septic tanks.</i>
<i>To collect and transport all this faecal sludge</i>
<i>there are around 70 privately owned trucks operating</i>
<i>that belong to 2 well organised pit emptyers associations.</i>
<i>There are also 6 manual emptying businesses</i>
<i>using the gulper, working together with Water For People.</i>
<i>KCCA, the Kampala Capital
City Authority</i>
<i>wants to formalise the faecal sludge collection and transport sector</i>
<i>and this is high on their agenda.</i>
<i>And there is also an operational treatment plant</i>
<i>to deliver all that faecal sludge to,</i>
<i>which is operated by NWSC,</i>
<i>the National Water and
Sewage Corporation.</i>
<i>2 years ago, the Lubigi Faecal
Sludge Plant opened up</i>
<i>with a designed capacity of 400 cubic metres per day.</i>
NWSC is also forward in thinking of solutions.
For example, they had this tender out for private companies interested in the design, build, and operation of waste energy business models at their treatment facility.
<i>There's also lots of applied research being conducted</i>
<i>by the Universities, research institutes including SANDEC,</i>
<i>NGOs, and NWSC.</i>
<i>Here you see research on increasing rates of drain</i>
<i>generating fuel from faecal sludge for use in the kiln.</i>
<i>An optimisation of collection logistics.</i>
<i>These are pictures of the pit emptyers association.</i>
<i>Another thing NWSC has done</i>
<i>is set the fee for discharge that collection and transport companies</i>
<i>have to pay, low enough</i>
<i>and is much cheaper than what they charge households.</i>
<i>So the incentive of trucks for illegal dumping</i>
<i>is quite low.</i>
<i>In addition, NWSC</i>
<i>provides space at their treatment plants</i>
<i>to locate their associations and park their trucks.</i>
So what are the challenges still being faced in Kampala?
This is the SFT for Kampala also prepared by SANDEC.
<i>We see safely managed excreta at 48%.</i>
<i>And unsafely managed at 52%.</i>
<i>There's not enough treatment capacity.</i>
<i>The Lubigi Treatment Plant was already operating at capacity</i>
<i>within the first month it was built.</i>
<i>To address this,</i>
<i>NWSC reopened the Bugoloobi
Waste Water Treatment Plant</i>
<i>for discharge of faecal sludge</i>
<i>which is not ideal as it's now over capacitated,</i>
<i>but much better than the alternative of illegal dumping.</i>
<i>In good news, Bugoloobi is under renovation</i>
<i>and there are 2 more faecal sludge treatment plants called for</i>
<i>in the sanitation master plan.</i>
<i>One of which, is in the planning phase</i>
<i>but not yet in the construction phase.</i>
Japan is a country where on site and centralised sewer based solutions  have evolved in parallel.
Japan can be held up as an example of how faecal sludge management can work as a long term solution.
<i>There is an effective system of collection and transport in place</i>
<i>with discharge to treatment plants subsidised.</i>
<i>There are well organised and functioning treatment plants.</i>
<i>30% of Toyokawa is served by on site systems.</i>
<i>And 100% of excreta is safely managed</i>
<i>as shown in this SFT, prepared by Professor Hidenori Harada</i>
<i>of Kyoto University.</i>
So why does faecal sludge management works so well in Japan?
Due to the enabling environment.
<i>There's a system of laws and enforcement in place</i>
<i>to ensure that every year, on site systems are inspected</i>
<i>and maintained by a licensed service provider.</i>
<i>Collection and transport companies are licensed and regulated.</i>
<i>Legal discharge of faecal sludge is subsidised.</i>
<i>The installation and manufacture of on site systems</i>
<i>is regulated and as our on site discharge standards.</i>
So what has generated the successes in all 3 of these cities?
We see that there is support and acceptance of the importance of sanitation and now faecal sludge management at the governmental level.
In Hanoi and Kampala, the municipalities are willing to look for new and alternative solutions, which is critical.
They have to be leaders to implement successful solutions as there are not a lot of models of success to follow.
This is in combination with strong participation by the private sector which is now being acknowledged by the government.
So even though these governments are having to retrofit solutions to their existing situations, they are managing to piece together city wide approaches which can be implemented and then improved upon.

And also watch the model shift flow diagrams in our MOOC on planning and design of sanitation systems and technologies.
In this module, you learned about differences in faecal sludge management in 
Hanoi, Kampala and Toyokawa.
Examples of what is, and is not working in each of the cities, and we're introduced to the shift flow diagrams illustrating safely and unsafely managed excreta for each of the cities.
Thanks for joining, see you next time.
