Welcome to our massively on-line open course on basic steps on magnetic resonance.
Today, we shall be talking about spin-spin couplings that are the subject of chapter three of Peter Hore's book.
The appearance of multiplets in NMR spectra is familiar to all practitioners of analytical NMR, familiar to virtually all chemists, to many biologists, and even to physicists.
However, not all of them are aware of the subtle aspects of multiplet structures.
Spin-spin couplings were originally discovered by serendipity in the 1950â€™s by Erwin Hahn.
He noticed that spin echoes were modulated.
This observation came shortly after Hahn's invention or his discovery of spin echoes.
More about this subject in chapter six.
Such echo modulations can be observed even when the homogeneity of the static field is too poor to resolve the multiplet structures, as indeed was usually the case in the 1950â€™s.
Scalar couplings have a few important properties.
First of all, they are â€œisotropicâ€�.
That means that they do not depend on the orientation of the molecule with respect to the external field.
They are also field independent, that is to say, they have the same magnitude at, say, 400 or 800 Mz.
They are mediated by electrons via the so-called Fermi interaction, and are said to be through-bond as opposed to through-space.
It is still a challenge today to calculate scalar coupling constants with reasonable accuracy.
If the coupling constants are known, the multiplets that due to scalar couplings, can be predicted with remarkable accuracy by simple diagonalization of the matrix representation of the Hamiltonian in the product base.
The agreement between theory and experiment is viewed by some as a nice confirmation that quantum mechanics actually works perfectly in this case.
This perfection is due to the fact that Hilbert space, i.e., the space that comprises all spin states, is of finite dimension.
Multiplets due to scalar couplings give crucial information about molecular symmetry.
They offer a great opportunity to practice group theory.
Multiplets that are due to scalar couplings, give unique insight into populations of rotamers, and into their inter-conversion.
Another fascinating aspect is that averaging allows the chemist to grasp the flexible, and generally speaking, dynamic nature of most molecules.
Chapter three of Peter Hore's book on nuclear magnetic resonance, is dedicated to spin-spin couplings.
In his characteristic fashion,
Peter Hore speaks first about the manifestations of couplings in an empirical fashion.
Next, he proceeds to explain where they really come from.
These aspects are treated one after the other.
So multiplets, particularly those in proton NMR spectra, are quite familiar to the practicing chemist, particularly to organic chemists because multiplets allow them to identify fragments of the molecules they are trying to analyze, that they have synthesized or hope to synthesize.
We shall start with the important example of ethanol, but now observed in a magnetic field of a modern magnet that has a sufficient homogeneity so that we can not only resolve the three chemical shifts of the OH, methylene and methyl protons, but also their fine structure.
This fine structure is due to scalar couplings.
As most chemists will know, the CH2 signal is split into a quartet because the CH2 group has a CH3 group as neighbour.
While the CH3 group is split into a triplet, because its neighbour is a CH2 group.
This kind of logic has become instinctive for many chemists, but in fact, it's not so easy to explain.
And one of our objectives is to go into some detail in the course of this chapter.
Multiplets are perhaps best explained in so-called hetero-nuclear systems where we have for example, one proton, which has a spin 1/2 with two states, alpha and beta.
And one carbon-13, also with two states, alpha and beta.
We can take a molecule, which only contains two such spins.
For example, the conjugate base of formic acid, or formate, if you will, with a singe proton and a single carbon-13.
About 1% in natural abundance, or up to 100% if we enrich the material.
There are two spectra.
If we take a field of 9.4 tesla, the proton appears in the vicinity of 400 MHz, while the carbon-13 appears in the vicinity of 100 MHz.
In both cases, however, we do not see singlets, but we see doublets.
So the proton signal is split into a doublet and so is the carbon signal.
It turns out that the two splittings are exactly the same.
If we wonder where this comes from, we have to look at the energy-level diagram.
Remember that spectral transitions, i.e., the lines in the spectrum always correspond to differences in energies.
If we consider a single isolated proton, its polarization can be parallel with the magnetic field.
We call this the alpha state.
Or it can be anti-parallel, in which case we call it the beta state.
Of course, between the two energy levels, there is only one transition which is near 400 megahertz.
And consequently, we observe a singlet.
But if we now have a carbon-13 in the vicinity, it turns out that that carbon-13 itself can be in the alpha or beta states.
And in this case, we assume that the carbon-13 is in the beta state, that is to say, in an anti-parallel configuration.
And remains in this anti-parallel configuration while the proton is undergoing a transition.
It is a manifestation of the scalar coupling, that the splitting between these two states is larger than the splitting between the two states in the absence of a carbon-13.
Conversely, if we consider a carbon which is polarized parallel to the magnetic field, i.e., in the alpha configuration, then it turns out that the splitting between the two levels, where the proton flips from parallel to anti-parallel, is reduced.
If we think of the spectrum, the splitting is enhanced from here to here.
Consequently, the line moves from the central frequency to higher frequencies.
Remember that frequencies run from right to left, in NMR by convention.
On the other hand, the other line has a reduced energy splitting and therefore, a lower frequency.
So this line turns out to be on the right-hand side.
The effect of the scalar coupling, more specifically the one-bond scalar coupling, because there's only one bond between these two nuclei in formate, is to split the line of the proton into a doublet.
And likewise, through a similar argument, to split the carbon-13 line into a doublet with this same spacing.
We can generalize the argument and include arbitrary energies and arbitrary numbers of spins.
For example, we consider the energy of an arbitrary state.
Now we have many states and these states are specified by magnetic quantum numbers, lowercase <i>m</i>, which which can be either plus 1/2, or minus 1/2.
Each energy level is specified by two quantum numbers and each of them can be either plus or minus 1/2.
Having said that, the energy level diagram is primarily determined by this expression.
This is the Larmor frequency of spin A.
And that is the Larmor frequency of spin X.
This is
Planck's constant, the energy is expressed in joules, as it should be in the international system.
Though, in practice, NMR spectroscopists often express their frequencies in hertz (Hz), which you can achieve by dividing the energies by Planck's constant (h).
So we often write things is hertz, which amounts to energy divided by Planckâ€™s constant.
In this equation, the energy is expressed correctly in terms of joules.
You see that the main effect comes from the offsets, i.e., from the chemical shifts.
But this perturbing term is due to the scalar coupling between A and X.
It turns out that if <i>m</i>A and <i>m</i>X have the same sign, we have a positive contribution.
If they have opposite sign, we have a negative contribution.
We see this very nicely on this diagram.
First of all, we start with a molecule in the absence of a magnetic field.
Then we switch on the field for the A nucleus, so that we see a splitting.
This is the Zeeman splitting of spin A, which could be a proton.
Then we have another
Zeeman splitting for spin X, typically a carbon-13
The ratio of this splitting to this splitting should be equal to the ratio of the gamma of carbon-13 divided by the gamma of the protons.
The effect of the coupling is to increase this energy, because the two magnetic quantum numbers are minus 1/2 times minus 1/2, which is plus 1/4.
So we have an increase here.
And here, because we have a product of minus 1/2 and plus 1/2, the product will be minus 1/4.
And indeed, the energy decreases like this.
Here, it's again minus 1/4.
And here, it's plus 1/4, and indeed, the energy goes up.
This is clearly a consequence of this equation.
In practice, we see that for the A transitions, in the absence of a J-coupling, there would be just one line for spin A, i.e., for the proton.
And another line for the carbon-13.
But as soon as we introduce this J interaction, the A signal splits up into doublet, and the X signal also splits up in a doublet with equal spacing.
In this diagram, Peter Hore has aligned these arrows with the lines in the spectrum.
And this logic has been used throughout.
It is interesting to notice that
Peter Hore likes to draw energy level diagrams in this vertical fashion.
Many NMR spectroscopists are tempted to draw a diagram more in the fashion of a lozenge, where these would be the transitions of one spin, and these the transitions of the other spin.
Some of us think it's easier to remember this.
This is for a homo-nuclear system.
For a hetero-nuclear system, you would have large transitions for spin A, and smaller transitions, i.e., smaller energy differences, for the X transitions.
Some people prefer drawing a lozenge rather than a vertical â€œladderâ€� representation.
In larger spin systems, with three or more spins, we have more complicated multiplets.
The multiplet patterns can be â€œbuilt upâ€�, as it were, from different splittings that are invoked one after the other in a sort of cascade of splittings, sometimes called a 'tree'.
If we have a given spin that resonates at a chemical shift A, it will be split into a doublet if we have a neighbouring spin M with a coupling JAM.
And this doublet will be split into a sub-doublet by spin X with a coupling AX.
If we assign different transitions to different polarizations, it turns out that the left-most line of a multiplet, if all couplings are positive, corresponds to a situation where both M and X have negative m, i.e., are both in the beta configuration.
For the second line from left, spin M is still in the beta position, but X has flipped over from beta to alpha.
The transitions can be assigned in this manner.
This is a rather elaborate way of interpreting the different components of a multiplet in terms of states.
At this level, that one cannot describe all energy level diagrams like this.
For example, for a two-spin system, it would look like this.
If we have a third system, it would be like this.
We have two lozenges, and we can connect them like this.
It turns out that four parallel transitions of the cube correspond to transitions of spin A.
For example, these could be the transitions of spin A and the other transitions would be those of spin M and spin X.
One of the purposes of this picture is to show that under certain circumstances, the couplings J-AM and J-AX may become equivalent.
Spin A can be coupled to a spin X, and to another spin X, and in such a way that the two coupling constants are accidentally, or by symmetry, equal.
In this case, we have only one J, and it's called JAX.
And you can see what happens in this diagram, the inner transtions of these two doublets are shifted on top of each other and become degenerate.
This degeneracy means that the central line is twice as intense as the individual lines.
We can take this one step further.
We can consider the case where A is coupled to three different nuclei, all with the same coupling constant.
This is known as an AX3 system.
In this case, we have a quadruplet with a so-called binomial intensity distribution.
And each line can be assigned to the polarizations of the neighbouring X nuclei.
These multiplet patterns can be generalized in terms of Pascal's triangle, which is a simple way of rationalizing a binomial distribution.
You probably know how
Pascalâ€™s triangle is built up.
For example, this number three is just the sum of numbers one and two on the line above.
You can use that rule systematically all the way down.
What you obtain are binomial distributions, the distributions for different spin systems.
This is an A spin in AX2, AX3, â€¦ systems.
You may think this is purely formal, but, in fact, it is not.
The rules go a long way further.
You could, for example, consider a situation where we have a silicon-29 nucleus which has a spin 1/2, which is surrounded by four methyl groups.
This substance is called TMS, or tetramethylsilane.
There are 3 x 4 = 12 equivalent protons.
So the system is actually an AX12 system, and you can imagine that you have to expand Pascalâ€™s triangle a very long way to go that far.
By the way, these intensity rules are not always easy to identify on a spectrum because the outer lines are very weak compared to the central lines.
Sometimes you just don't see the outer lines.
And one way of not being fooled by the fact that the outer lines may be drowned in the noise, is to compare the lines of the central components.
In this case, we have 15:20:15, which is, of course, distinct from 1:2:1.
And therefore, we can identify on which level of the Pascalâ€™s triangle we are, without actually identifying the full list of lines.
There are many cases where couplings involve nuclei, so-called quadrupolar nuclei, which have spin quantum number I, larger than 1/2.
The simplest example being the deuterium nucleus, which has a spin I = 1.
The nitrogen-14 nucleus also has a spin I = 1.
Lithium-6 also has a spin I = 1.
Not to mention all the higher spins.
Now let's take a simple example where we consider a carbon-13 attached to a deuterium nucleus.
We call the carbon nucleus-13 spin X, while the deuterium nucleus will be called spin A.
In the energy-level diagram for the deuteron, which has I = 1, the magnetic quantum number m can be either
-1, or 0, or +1.
We find three levels corresponding to m = -1, or 0, or +1, the magnetic quantum numbers of the deuteron.
This transition is actually degenerate with this transition of the deuteron.
If we are in isotropic phase, there is actually no evidence that this is a quadrupolar nucleus.
But if we look at the carbon-13 multiplet, we have to take into account that there is a splitting.
Let's call this quantum number S to avoid confusion.
In this case, m can be m = -1/2, or m = +1/2.
These can be called beta or alpha states.
Now we have six energy levels, with a certain number of transitions.
We see on the carbon-13 side, i.e., on the X side, three transitions.
These are nicely aligned with these peaks.
There is a direct relationship between the energy level diagram and the spectrum.
Some people say that a spectrum is nothing else but a peculiar â€œprojectionâ€� of the energy-level diagram.
If we look at the A side, it turns out that these lines are still rigorously degenerate, since they have exactly the same frequency.
So they end up as a doubly degenerate line.
Likewise, these two transitions are exactly degenerate and pile up on top of each other to give a doubly-degenerate line.
The remarkable thing is that for the X nucleus, i.e., of the carbon-13 nucleus, we don't have a binomial triplet, but we have a triplet with equal intensities 1:1:1.
There are many other quadrupolar nuclei.
We have the example of boron-11, which has a spin quantum number I = 3/2
The magnetic quantum number m of boron-11 can go from m = - 3/2 to m = - 1/2, m = + 1/2,and finally m = + 3/2.
So there are four distinct quantum states for each boron-11.
Consider this peculiar molecule, known as diborane, which comes from the condensation of two BH3 molecules.
We have twice BH3 that give a B2H6.
The structure of this B2H6 is a rather peculiar assembly, where we have 4 so-called terminal protons.
Each of these terminal protons only â€œseesâ€� one boron-11.
(Incidentally, we assume that boron-10 has been removed by suitable synthetic preparation.)
Now each proton sees just one boron-11, and consequently the terminal protons are split up into a quartet of four equal lines.
This is a non-binomial
1:1:1 quartet. that is characteristic of any nucleus coupled to a spin 3/2 nucleus.
But more peculiar is what happens if we look at the bridging protons.
These protons actually have equal bonds to two borons, and also equal scalar couplings.
In fact, the whole molecule is completely symmetrical.
And these protons and these borons are magnetically equivalent.
If we want to understand the fine structure of the multiplet of the bridge proton, we have to divide the signal into four equal peaks, and each of them has to be subdivided again into four equal peaks.
Because the two couplings are equivalent, like in AX2 and AX3 systems, there are two ways of getting to this line: either from here, or from here.
And therefore, the intensity of this line is twice as high as the first line.
So we have rather peculiar multiplets, with relative intensities 1:2:3:4:3:2:1, which is not a binomial multiplet.
This does not fit into the logic of Pascal's triangle.
But you see where this comes from.
By way of exercise,
I would like to encourage you to think of the next level.
What happens if a proton were coupled to three boron nuclei?
Then of course, we have an even more complex multiplet.
The challenge is to determine its multiplicity.
This is not an academic question, since there are actual molecules that have such patterns.
So this concludes part one of this chapter.
Thank you for you attention.
