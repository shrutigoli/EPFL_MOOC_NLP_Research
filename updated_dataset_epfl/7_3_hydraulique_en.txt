During this third module dedicated to Bernoulli's principle we will begin by seeing applications of hydraulics with free surfaces. We will now see a few definitions, among other things the notion of head, of head loss, of specific head, of steady state. And during the final module we will see applications to be able to calculate and make hydraulic calculations with free surface. To better understand this notion of head loss, i.e. the dissipation of energy during the motion, we can make an analogy with a ball rolling without slipping  along a topography in some way of a rollercoaster.
If we assume that there are no losses of energy by friction, if I release a particle A with no initial velocity along a random profile, it will reach here the point C. So here we have the translation relatively simple of the principle of conservation of mechanical energy. This mechanical energy or total energy is constant, and is equal to the potential energy + kinetic energy.
When the ball will go down, it will reach its maximum velocity at point B, which will also correspond to the point where the potential energy is minimum in this motion. So of course it is an idealization of what is happening.
In reality, the ball, due to friction, will dissipate a part of its energy. So in practice if you release a particle on a profile with no initial velocity, it will roll, slide, and will go a little less high than the initial position, and so it will stop here at point C. We will then have a regular decrease of the total energy. The height difference here between the initial point A, which should have been the final point, and the point C provides information on the quantity of energy that has been dissipated.
We will see that in hydraulics we will translate all the energy dissipations in terms of water height, we will thus see that this measure of height difference will directly provide information of the energy dissipation, that we will call head loss. So to sum up, the height difference translates the energy loss, so we always have the variation of total energy that is equal to the variation of kinetic energy + the variation of potential energy. In this case here the total energy is not conserved and will be here slightly negative. We will have a relation that will be identical for the hydraulics except that the total head that we will consider will be at the time the gravity potential, Ñ±, the pressure and the kinetic energy. Hydraulicians are used to always reason in equivalent energy of water height, so if I divide this energy by Ï±g I have something that is homogeneous to a height. Î”H here that will be negative will be the head loss. Now, if I write this head loss translated in equivalent of water height, I will have the gravity potential that will correspond to the height or the position of the riverbed , the pressure term will correspond here to the height of my water column, or the depth of water. We have here a water motion animated by an average velocity u, I have here the kinetic energy translated in equivalent height. As so often we will be interested in rivers, so in water flows on distances relatively long, we will have in general variations of the bottom elevation that will be relatively modest compared to the variations of height or of velocity, so in many applications this term here will be nearly constant, what will be varying are h and u. For this reason we introduce another head called the specific head, which is equal to the water height, to the pressure term and the kinetic energy term converted into equivalent water height. The sum of both is called the specific head.
The first application of the notion of specific head concerns the calculation of the relation that exists between flow rate and height for a specific energy or specific head constant. For that we will use the hypothesis of steady state : the flow rate per unit width is constant, and is equal to u/h, so
I will be able to substitute in the definition of the specific head the velocity by the ratio q/h. When I do this, I have the following relation that, for the specific head, will be equal to h + the term qÂ²/(2ghÂ²). If
I assume that the specific head is constant,
I can easily deduce what q is equal to as a function of Hð�—Œ, and I obtain the following relation that I can write in dimensionless form by introducing a dimensionless flow rate, that will be equal to my flow rate divided by g the flow rate, by the specific head raised to the power 3, and I introduce the parameter xi that will be equal to the water height divided by the specific head. What we see is that the dimensionless flow rate is written as the square root of the following equation. Let's look at the shape of this function : we have a curve bell-shaped, but an asymmetric bell, with here an increasing part that will correspond if we calculate Froude numbers. to the
Froude numbers greater than
1. We will call this regime the supercritical regime. The point here Î¾ = 2/3 corresponds to the maximum flow rate, and also to the Froude number = 1, and here the decreasing part will correspond to Froude number that are smaller than 1. We will speak of subcritical regime. What is important to note here is that for a specific energy or head constant, there exists a flow rate maximum, so here we cannot exceed this zone and this maximum flow rate is in fact linked to the specific head. The second interesting element to note is that if we look at what is happening at a given flow rate, for example here the flow rate = 0.3, I will have two possible heights, one in the supercritical regime that will correspond to a small water height, and another here, in the subcritical regime, that will correspond to a water height that will be bigger. The height that will correspond to the Froude number = 1 will be called the critical height. What must be noted is that for any flow rate with a specific head constant, there exists two possible heights, one in the supercritical regime also called torrential regime), and that this height will end up here, it will thus be smaller than the critical height. There exists a second height in the subcritical regime, also called fluvial regime, and this height will be greater than the critical height. The second application consists in now looking how varies the specific energy as a function of the height when we assume that the flow rate is constant.
We fix a flow rate, Q, per unit width, and we look at how the specific head varies.
For that, as previously, we will introduce the ratio Î¾ which is the ratio between the water height and the critical height, and we also introduce a specific head dimensionless by dividing the specific head by the critical height. When we do this we obtain the relation here which is extremely simple. We see that when Î¾ is very big compared to 1, this term that is here becomes very small. so becomes negligible, so the specific head behaves as the water height. Conversely, when Î¾ is very small compared to 1, this term here is close to zero and this term here very very big.
Here it means that the specific head will behave like a function that will be inversely proportional to the water height. If I translate this in graphical form, 
I find here that a very large number of
Î¾, the specific head, must tend to the first asymptote, so that corresponds to H equal to Î¾, and that conversely when
I am at a very small number Î¾, I must have something that looks like a parabolic branch, so that must tend very quickly to infinity. Like previously what we will be able to do is to distinguish two regimes. A regime here that corresponds to the subcritical regime, and here a regime that will be the supercritical regime, the minimum here will correspond the transition of the critical regime, so to the Froude number equal to
1.  This diagram solves problems extremely simple, for example how does a water line varies, we will call this a backwater curve, so how varies the position of the free surface when we have, at the bottom of the river, an obstacle.  For example here a step or a stair tread.
To simplify I will assume that we are at the upstream at a certain velocity, a certain height, and that we are in a subcritical regime, this the Froude number is smaller than
1. I will also suppose that we have a frame of reference situated here, we thus have a certain elevation zð�–º, than the step's height, of the step, is equal to p. We also call this in hydraulics the shovel, it is a term of old french that designates this height difference.  As we are in a subcritical regime, or sub-fluvial, we are situated in this part here of the curve that links the specific head as a function of the height. I will now apply Bernoulli's principle between point A and the point B. According to Bernoulli's principle the water height 
+ the gravity potential, i.e. the elevation + the kinetic energy, i.e. the term here  uÂ²/2g must be constant between the point A and the point B. We have seen that these two terms here, the specific charge and z will vary between the point A and the point B of a value that will be the value p. If now
I reason in a qualitative way on the diagram h as a function of Î¾, I am at point A, I am increasing the height of a value p, so in dimensionless form this will (p/Hc), so it means that I must have a decrease of the specific head here that will be equal to p/Hc, or in dimensionless form, we will see that the specific head at point B it will be the specific head at point A minus this height difference, i.e. p. Hence we see qualitatively that in the subcritical regime, the transition here of a step by a displacement of point A to point
B will results in a decrease of the height as we have going from a height that is here to a height that is here. If now I reasoned in a torrential regime, the displacement will be done in this direction here and it will result in a slight increase of the height. So typically if I had a torrential regime I would have something that takes the shape of the bottom and that must slightly increase passing step. We will now address an important point concerning the equilibrium conditions of water flows in a river. To do so we will consider a volume of water. As we are still reasoning by unit width, this volume is simply a rectangle represented here with a certain length L and a certain height h. This control volume is subjected to many forces, so pressure forces, on each side here, these pressure forces as the height is constant will counterbalance themselves, we will thus not take them into account. The volume is also subjected to is own weight with a driving component that will simply be the projection of the weight on the x axis. As we will have friction during the motion we assume that we have here a friction force that is exerted, and this force per units of area, so the stress at the bottom that we call wall stress : Ï„ð�˜±. is exerted here. So if I simply write the equilibrium between the driving force of gravity and the friction force, I will have PsinÎ¸ that will be equal to Ï±ghLsinÎ¸, p simply being the density multiplied by the volume, and I project here by sinÎ¸. This driving force must be counterbalanced by the friction forces so here the friction stress multiplied by the length on which this friction stress is applied. So if you simplify here by L you obtain the following relation : Ï„ð�˜± = Ï±ghsinÎ¸ that constitutes the equilibrium condition. 
Each time that we will have a river at equilibrium, the bottom stress will be strictly equal to Ï±ghsinÎ¸. Now, let's examine what this equilibrium condition implies if we examine the conservation Bernoulli's principle. For that we will consider an infinitesimal volume of length L =dx and
I will writhe Bernoulli's principle on a small slice, here between a point
A and a point B. Again, what I must have is that the gravity potential, i.e. the bottom elevation + the pressure, i.e. the water height + the kinetic energy resulting in water height, i.e. uÂ²/(2g), this sum must be conserved, if it isn't that we now suppose an energy dissipation, so here a head loss Î”H, that must be negative. So we must have a decrease of the head between the point A and the point B, due to friction. If we suppose that the height here is constant between these points and that the velocity is constant, all that we must have is that the elevation of point
A must equal to the elevation of point B
+ this head loss Î”H. As I have an infinitesimal volume, I will be able to link by introducing here the slope angle, so i will be the slope, tangent Î¸. So what
I will have is that the elevation of point A minus the elevation of point B is equal to idx, and by using the previous relation and introducing a friction slope, so I assume that the head loss dH/dx is equal to jð�˜§, the equilibrium condition if we use Bernoulli's principle is that the slope must be equal to the friction slope. It is a result that we will use afterwards in the equation of the backwater curves. We ask the question now of knowing what is worth this head loss, for that we will introduce the notion of friction law, that describes how the energy is dissipated, in other words how  does the head loss varies as a function of the flow variables u and h. So there exists many formulations, many empirical forms, in general taken from experimental data obtained in laboratories.
The best known of these formulations is the
Manning-Strickler formula. This Manning-Strickler formula for example links the wall stress, or side stresses, as function the average velocity uÂ² and as a function of the water height raised to the power
1/3. There appears thus a friction coefficient called Manning-Strickler coefficient, if we refer to what we had seen in the chapter dedicated to similarities, what we can show experimentally and that we can justify theoretically is that this Manning-Strickler coefficient is linked to the roughness scale of the bed, so here a dâ‚‰â‚€, it means that
90% of the grains have a size smaller than this dâ‚‰â‚€, and so the Manning-
Strickler coefficient is equal to 26/(dâ‚‰â‚€)^(1/6), with units here that we will specify afterwards. Now if I use the equilibrium condition expressed in terms of stress, we had seen that when the river, the water flow was in a uniform steady state, the stress at the bottom was equal to Ï±ghsinÎ¸. If now
I use Manning-Strickler formula seen previously, what I must have when I equalize the two terms, it allows me to calculate what the velocity is equal to as a function of the height. Here what we show is that the average velocity must vary as h^(2/3) multiplied by the friction coefficient and weighted by âˆši, i being the channel's slope. When we solve this equation here we can reason in terms of height instead than in terms of velocity and we have in this case the height in steady state, what we call the normal height which will be equal to the flow rate per units of width divided by the Manning-Strickler coefficient and divided by âˆši, the whole raised to the power 3/5th. During this third module we have seen a couple of elementary notions of hydraulics with free surface, mainly the notion of specific head, the notion of head loss and the notion of equilibrium condition. We will now go a little further by examining what is happening in a river, when we are working at constant flow rate but that the water height can vary.
