We hope that you enjoyed this week with us.
I would like you to focus on the concepts presented in this Unit.
Once this concepts are clearly understood, including their application, you can take the final test of the Unit.
We would like to remind you about the focus on Space Debris Observation and Removal with the interviews of 
Thomas Schildknecht and Muriel Richard, two Swiss experts on the subject of Space Debris.
Take it.
