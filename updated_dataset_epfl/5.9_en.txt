Weâ€™ve reached the end of our MOOC on law enforcement.
I hope it met your expectation and helped you understand what fields law enforcement covers inside our protected areas.
The idea was to look at the legal documents that apply to the conservation of these territories, to understand where they come from, their scope, their limitationsâ€¦
To master the meaning of key concepts such as values, ethics, deontology and corruption, â€¦but also to know the rules and procedures to give and follow orders and instructions properly.
And finally, weâ€™ve seen how to translate this in a park through surveillance and the fight against poaching.
Of course, I would like to thank the speakers involved in this MOOC: Lydia Slobodian, Philippe
Gitz and Benoit Koutoua Amon.
Iâ€™m not forgetting the PAPACO team, the staff of the Digital Education Centre, and our friends at MOOCs for Africa at the EPFL without whom this programme wouldnâ€™t even exist.
If you have any suggestions to improve this
MOOC, please feel free to share them with us.
And of course, stay connected by following our other MOOCs, and by visiting papaco.org and our Facebook page.
You can sign up to the NAPA newsletter if you wish to stay in touch month after month.
Finally, I must also thank the organisations that financed this MOOC.
The Ecole Polytechnique FÃ©dÃ©rale de Lausanne and the France-IUCN partnership, particularly the French Development Agency.

There, I do hope weâ€™ll be in touch again through our other MOOC.
Have a great day!
