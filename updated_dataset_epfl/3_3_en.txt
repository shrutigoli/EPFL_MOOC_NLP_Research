We are trying to solve the following problem: given a continuous function g on the inteval  [-1,1] we wish to numerically approximate the integral between -1 and 1 of g(t) dt.
The variable t varies between -1 and 1, here is the graph of g(t), this is the integral we are trying to approximate.
We will now define what a quadrature formula is, quadrature formula to numerically approximate the integral between -1 and 1 of g(t) dt.
We define an integer M, in general M has value 1,2 or 3, occasionally 4 or 5 but rarly more. 
We define quadrature nodes, values t1 strictly smaller then t2 and so on up to t_M which are in the interval [-1,1].
Here is a the quadrature node t2.
The idea is to evaluate the function g at these points t_1, t_2, t_M.
We shall also define the weights, named omega_1, omega_2 and so on until omega_M, which we call quadrature weights.
We want to approximate the integral between -1 and 1 of g(t) dt by a quadrature rule, which is obtained by evaluating the function g in the node t1 the function g in t_2 and so on until evaluating g in t_M.
Again g in t_2, g in t_3 up to g in t_M.
Then you multiply these values by the weights omega_1, omega_2 until omega_M.
This will be the approximation of the integral between -1 and 1 of g(t) dt. 
For example one can use the midpoint rule (also called rectangle rule) which consists in the following: for a function g which you want  to integrate over the interval -1 and 1 and you can decide to take only one single point.
So, choosing one single point
M = 1, then the point is t1=0, the middle of [-1,1].
Hence I will approximate the integral on [-1,1] of g(t) dt by the area of the corresponding rectangle. 
Since the rectangle has width 2 and height g(0), the area will be 2 times g(0).
This defines J(g) for the midpoint rule, again J(g) = 2 g(0).
Another example is the trapezoidal quadrature rule. 
In this case I will consider two quadrature nodes.
By choosing two quadrature nodes, here the variable t in the interval [-1,1],
I am trying to numerically approximate the integral over -1 and 1 of g(t) dt.
I will choose for both quadrature nodes: t1 = -1 and t2= 1, now I can approximate the area of the trapeze which is hashed here. 
So for M = 2, t1 = -1 and t2 = 1.
The area of the trapeze is given by g(-1) plus g(1), which is the area of this rectangle, plus the area of the triangle above the rectangle. 
VoilÃ .
Returning to the initial problem:
I remind you that we we want to compute the integral over [a,b] of f(x) dx, the notations are: the variable x is in the interval [a,b] and we are trying to approximate numerically the integral of the function f between a and b.
Here is the graph of the function f and we divide the interval [a,b] into sub-intevals.
Therefore the integral is equal to h/2 times the sum for 0 to M-1 of the integrals between -1 and 1 of f(x_i +h (t+1) / 2) dt.
This was the result we reached previously, and here are the nodes x_0,x_1 up to x_N.
The idea is to use this quadrature formula to approximate the function g, defined on each interval, by g(t)= f(xi + h(t+1) / 2) and we then have the following numerical approximation: for h divided by 2, we have the sum over all the intervals xi, all of these intervals here, first, second,third, fourth, and now you have the sum omega_1 times g( t_1 ), omega_2 times g( t_2 ) and so on until omega_M times g( t_M ), which we can write as the sum for j from 1 to M of omega_j, which can be found here, omega_1, omega_2, etc, times the function f here, evaluated at t_j.
Therefore you now have f(xi + h ( tj+1 )/2).
So here is the approximation of this integral.
I obtain this approximation here
I have used this quadrature formula defined here.
This quantity here, which I will denote L_h(f) is the approximation of the integral between a and b of f(x) dx, by using this quadrature rule, defined by a certain number of nodes and weights.
Now the obvious questions that arise are the following, there are at least two: how do I choose the quadrature nodes t_1, t_2 and so on until t_M with their respective weights, and the second question is what error am I making when I approximate the integral between a and b of f(x) dx, using this new quantity that
I have defined to approximate this integral, namely L_h ( f ).
