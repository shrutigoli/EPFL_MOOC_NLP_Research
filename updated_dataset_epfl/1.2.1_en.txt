The fundamental laws of mechanics of Newton
The first law is: 
In the absence of a force a body either is at rest or moves in a straight line with constant speed and this is with respect to what we call an inertial frame.
The frame of this room, for instance, is not an inertial frame.
If we drop an object it's going to be going toward the center of the Earth, but there would be a slight deviation because we are in a rotating frame.
The Earth is rotating on itself and is also revolving around the Sun but with respect to inertial frame, and I'll come back to that later, the first law is valid.
The second law is a fundamental law of mechanics:
A body experiencing a force <i>vectorial F</i> will be subject to an acceleration <i>a vectorial</i> such that <i>F vectorial</i> equals <i>m a vectorial</i> where <i>m</i> is the mass of the body.
The third law is the following:
Whenever a first body exerts a force <i>F</i> on a second body, the second body exerts a force minus <i>F vectorial</i> on the first body.
The two forces are of equal magnitude and opposite in direction.
This is really important.
The forces are always in couples in nature.
Whether it's the force that the Sun exerts on the Earth and the Earth on the Sun, these are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
I'm standing on the floor here.
There is a force of so many Newton, which is my weight, toward the floor but the floor exerts a force of equal magnitude but opposite direction on me so that
I am still with respect to the floor.
Forces are always in couples in nature.
Generalization of Newton's second law:
The force <i>F vectorial</i> equals <i>dp</i> over <i>dt</i>,
<i>p</i> being the momentum, the product of the mass times the velocity vectorial, and this is a generalization.
We see that <i>dp</i> over <i>dt</i>, <i>p</i> equal <i>m v</i>.
If we have a variation in <i>m</i>, of course, that would be giving different results from the application of the law of Newton as it was expressed on the last slide, especially if we have a leaking system or if we handle subject of propulsion at a later time in the course, where, of course,
<i>m</i> is varying because we're expelling mass in the throttle of a propulsion system of the spacecraft, for instance, then it's important to use the generalization of Newton's second law.
Inertial frame
We talked about that briefly before.
It's really important that all of the positions and velocities that we will be using later, X, Y, Z, and X dot, Y dot, Z dot, the time derivative of the position with respect to inertial frame, and we'll define various inertial frames depending on whether we have the motion of a spacecraft or satellite around the Earth or around the Sun, or anywhere else in the universe, but inertial frame has direction, direction of the axes which are basically, towards  distant stars which are basically nodes moving on, moving very, very slowly, and the concept is important.
An inertial frame is a frame with respect to which the laws of Newton are valid, and the center of the inertial frame, which is orthogonal coordinate system, will depend on the application.
Now the validity of Newton's law is very general.
It's a very powerful set of laws, the Apollo program, the International Space Station, the Shuttle program: all respect the Newton's law without the corrections due to relativity, the correctional relativity which is through the Lorentz factor which you see here in the bottom: one divided by square root of one minus 
<i>v</i> over <i>c</i> square,
<i>c</i> being the speed of light.
It's a very, very small factor for all the common velocities we have for spacecraft around the Earth or in the solar system.
We basically have velocities, or speed, which are smaller than one thousandth of the speed of light.
So these factors are extremely small.
