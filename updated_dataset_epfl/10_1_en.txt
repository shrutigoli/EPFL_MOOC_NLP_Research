Welcome to chapter 10: one dimensional boundary value problems.
The topics I will cover are the following:
I will firstly introduce a model problem.
This is paragraph 10.1 in the book.
Then I shall talk about the finite difference method, which shall be used to approximate the solution to the problem. 
I will also consider a non linear problem, this is paragraph 10.6 of the book.
Please note that 
I'll will not talk about the finite elements method.
