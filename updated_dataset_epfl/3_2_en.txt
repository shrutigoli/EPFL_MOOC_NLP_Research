The problem we want to solve is the following: for a given function f defined on the interval [a,b], we want to numerically approximate the integral between a and b of f(x) dx.
If a draw a figure, given the x axis and the interval [a,b], the graph of the function f, and I am searching for the area between the x axis and the curve f.
Firstly I divide the interval [a,b] into sub-intervals of equal length. 
Here I have the first point, which I name x0, the last point is xn and between them you have the points x1, x2 and so on and in the middle you have the nodes x_i followed by x_i+1.
All these points are separated by a parameter, a distance which I will name h. 
So we have N the number of sub-intervals which should be large, h the distance between two consecutive points equal to (b-a)/N which should be small and the nodes x_i equal to a plus i times h for i between 0 up to N.
Hence the integral between a and b of f(x) dx is nothing but the sum over all the sub-intervals from 0 to N-1, of the integrals between x_i and x_i+1 of f(x) dx.
Now I will do a change of variable which will take me from
[x_i,x_i+1] to [-1,1] and the variable is now t.
Hence I decide that x is equal to xi + h times t+1 divided by 2, such that when t is equal to -1, well x = x_i and when t is equal to 1 well x = xi + h, also equal to x_i+1.
Of course we have that dx is equal to h over 2 times dt therefore the integral between a and of f(x) dx is equal to the sum for i between 0 and N-1 of h divided by 2, which can be moved outside of the sum and we now have the integral between -1 and 1 evaluated in
[xi+h (t+1)/2] dt. So now we have the following problem which involves integrals on [-1,1].
The problem to be addressed is now the following.
Given a function g defined now on [-1,1] which is continuous,
I seek to numerically approximate the integral between [-1,1] of g(t) dt.
