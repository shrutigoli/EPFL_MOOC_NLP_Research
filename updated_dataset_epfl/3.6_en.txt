We hope that you enjoyed this week with us.
I would like you to focus on the concepts presented in this unit.
Once these concepts are clearly understood, including their application, you can take the final test of the unit.
We'd like to remind you about the focus on the CHEOPS satellite, with the interview of the principal investigator, Willy Benz.
Thanks.
