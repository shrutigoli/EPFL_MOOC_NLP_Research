In this module, we'll talk about diseases caused by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene, and how they can be classified, as well as the burden of disease due to unsafe water, sanitation, hygiene, both in terms of deaths or mortality and disease or morbidity.
<i>They say that three things in life are certain: birth, taxes and death,</i>
<i>and somehow some people manage to avoid taxes.</i>
<i>But deaths are inevitable.</i>
<i>There are about 55 million people who die every year</i>
<i>but there are even more people who have babies every year.</i>
<i>About 135 million new babies are born each year.</i>
<i>So that means overall there is about a 1.1% increase</i>
<i>in the global population each year,</i>
<i>and the population will double every sixty years at current rates.</i>
<i>One useful way to classify diseases was proposed by the authors</i>
<i>of the 1972 classic book â€œDrawers of Waterâ€�.</i>
<i>According to environmental transmission pathways</i>
<i>this so called â€œBradley Classificationâ€� includes four types: water-borne,</i>
<i>water-washed, water-based and water-related diseases.</i>
<i>Now some of those 55 million deaths per year are caused, at least in part</i>
<i>by unsafe water sanitation and hygiene.</i>
<i>And we can think about different ways to classify those diseases.</i>
<i>First, we can talk about the water-borne diseases</i>
<i>which are diseases caused by actually drinking, ingesting water</i>
<i>that has some pathogens in it.</i>
<i>These include the diarrheal diseases caused by different pathogens:</i>
<i>Rotavirus, Cholera, 
Shigella or Cyptosporidium</i>
<i>but also Hepatitis A and E</i>
<i>and even Polio can be transmitted through drinking water.</i>
<i>For any of these water-borne diseases</i>
<i>an intervention to reduce the disease then could involve improving the water quality.</i>
<i>Next we have the water-washed diseases which are caused by poor hygiene</i>
<i>due to lack of water rather than by direct ingestion.</i>
<i>Most water-borne diseases are also water-washed</i>
<i>because they can be transmitted through hands</i>
<i>and contact with other surfaces.</i>
<i>Trachoma is the leading cause of preventable blindness globally</i>
<i>and is transmitted by flies which land on people's faces.</i>
<i>And Acute respiratory infections are also transmitted through contact</i>
<i>with pathogens on hands and other surfaces.</i>
<i>Water-washed diseases can be reduced</i>
<i>by increasing the amount of water that is available to improve hygiene.</i>
<i>Water-based diseases are those caused by parasites</i>
<i>which live part of their life cycle in water.</i>
<i>The most serious of this is the Schistosomiasis or Billharzia</i>
<i>which affects 160 million people globally, mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa.</i>
<i>Another serious water-based disease is Guinea Worm, or Dracunculiasis,</i>
<i>which is a horrible disease which used to affect many people,</i>
<i>3.5 million people in 1986,</i>
<i>but cases are now down to only 542 in 2012</i>
<i>and those are confined to about four countries mainly in South Sudan.</i>
<i>For water-based diseases control-mechanisms</i>
<i>involve targeting the aquatic organism host</i>
<i>and protecting surface water bodies from contamination.</i>
<i>Finally, there are water-related diseases which are caused by insects</i>
<i>which breed in water, especially mosquitoes.</i>
<i>The most important of these is malaria,</i>
<i>which affects about 250 million people each year, causing about 589,000 deaths.</i>
<i>The great majority of those are in Sub-Saharan Africa</i>
<i>and affect children under the age of five.</i>
<i>Another important mosquito disease is Dengue fever,</i>
<i>which is growing in numbers and can cause explosive outbreaks</i>
<i>especially in urban areas.</i>
<i>In both cases, the mosquitoes breed in certain types of water,</i>
<i>and a control mechanism is to remove their habitat.</i>
So in summary, there are many diseases which are caused at least partially, by unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene.
Water-borne diseases are those that are caused by directly drinking or ingesting contaminated water.
And those disease could be controlled at least partially, by treating the water at the household.
Household water treatment though shouldn't be expected to have an impact on other diseases that are water-washed, water-based, or water-related.
<i>Now let's take a little break.</i>
<i>You see on your screen five different infectious diseases,</i>
<i>and I'd like you to think for a minute</i>
<i>about which of them cause more or less deaths each year.</i>
<i>Arrange them in the order of number of deaths per year.</i>
<i>The most recent global mortality figures were release by the WHO in 2014</i>
<i>and estimate deaths over the years 2000 to 2012.</i>
<i>You can see that Lower 
Respiratory Infections such as pneumonia</i>
<i>were by far the largest cause of death among these diseases.</i>
<i>Diarrheal disease cause about 
1.5 million deaths,</i>
<i>followed by Tuberculosis, 
Malaria and Measles.</i>
Diarrheal disease is the most important of the water sanitation and hygiene-related diseases, and a major contributor to the global burden of disease.
Diarrhea is among the main causes of child mortality globally, second only to acute respiratory infections.
It's responsible for about one out of every ten deaths among children under the age of five.
That's about 1000 child deaths per day.
The WHO estimates that 56% of deaths due to Diarrhea worldwide are attributable to inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene.
So it's clear that poor access to the basic services have a major impact on global health, especially through preventing the transmission of water-related infectious diseases.
<i>So far we've been talking about burden of disease</i>
<i>in terms of deaths or mortality,</i>
<i>but it's also important to consider sicknesses</i>
<i>which can greatly reduce the quality of life or morbidity.</i>
<i>We can do this through a metric</i>
<i>that's called</i>Disability Adjusted 
Life Years<i>, or DALYs.</i>
<i>What DALYs do is combine two aspects.</i>
<i>First, the Years of Life Lost</i>
<i>in comparison to a Standard Life Expectancy</i>
<i>and second, the Years of Lost to Disability</i>
<i>which are the number of years you live with the disability</i>
<i>times a weight for how serious that disability is.</i>
<i>Well, let's consider this with some examples.</i>
<i>First, consider a person who has a normal life expectancy of 80 years</i>
<i>and has no particular disabilities.</i>
<i>Then this person lives a fully healthy life for 80 years</i>
<i>and has zero years of life lost or years lost to disability</i>
<i>so they have no DALYs.</i>
<i>Second, let's consider the example where someone also</i>
<i>has a life expectancy of 80 and lives a very normal life,</i>
<i>to begin with,</i>
<i>but then had some kind of sudden accident at age 70 and dies prematurely.</i>
<i>Then they have years of life lost.</i>
<i>How many? 
Ten years of life lost.</i>
<i>There's no disability here so the number of DALYs is ten.</i>
<i>Okay, this time let's consider a person who lives a normal healthy life</i>
<i>until age 50, when they have some kind of accident</i>
<i>which leads to a loss of a foot, amputation of the foot.</i>
<i>Now the disability weight for the foot amputation is 0.3.</i>
<i>So it goes up to there.</i>
<i>But then that person lives to the expected life expectancy of 80 .</i>
<i>So here we have years of life lost to disability. How many?</i>
<i>Thirty years from age 50 times the weight of 0.3 for foot amputation</i>
<i>is a total of nine, so that's 9 DALYs.</i>
<i>Finally, a more complicated example is a person who lives a normal life</i>
<i>until age 36, when they contract HIV AIDS.</i>
<i>Full-blown AIDS without any medicine, without antiretroviral therapy</i>
<i>has a weight of 0.5.</i>
<i>But after four years, that person then is able to get medication</i>
<i>and have a much better quality of life with the weight of 0.167.</i>
<i>Then that person lives until age 70, dying prematurely.</i>
<i>Forty-six, thirty-six, not forty.</i>
<i>So here we have years lost to disability,</i>
<i>and here we have years of life lost.</i>
<i>How many? Ten years of life lost.</i>
<i>How many years lived with disability?</i>
<i>We have four at that high rate, that's a total of two,</i>
<i>plus thirty at a lower rate, that's five, for a total of seven.</i>
<i>So then the DALYs equals to ten plus seven for seventeen.</i>
<i>So you can imagine the diarrheal disease then,</i>
<i>which impacts a very young children in many cases,</i>
<i>will also have a high contribution to DALYs</i>
<i>because of the large number of years of life lost.</i>
Now that we have a metric for morbidity, the DALYs, we can examine the overall burden of disease posed by diarrhea and compare it to other diseases globally.
Now that 2013 WHO report about deaths globally hasn't yet been analyzed to develop DALY estimates.
So we have to look at an older WHO report from 2008 shown up here, where they reported that diarrhea disease caused over 52 million DALYs per year, which again the distribution was very similar to the mortality numbers we've seen with a little bit more than 3% of the global total and about 9% of the burden of disease for children.
This report also listed country-wise DALYs and you could see that India was by far the largest country in terms of DALYs, in terms of disease burden followed by other large countries --
China, Nigeria, Pakistan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, which all had more than 3 million DALYs.
In fact, in DRC, the contribution of DALYs to the overall disease burden was more than 10% of all DALYs.
So far we've been talking about numbers generated by the WHO, either their 2000 report on mortality or earlier reports for morbidity or risk factors.
But there is another large important and recent data set out there, it's called the Global Burden of Disease 2010 Study and it was done by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation or IHME based in Seattle, Washington.
The GBD 2010 Study was a massive undertaking involving hundreds of scientists from all around the world including many WHO researchers.
However, even though it uses similar approach to the WHO models,
WHO hasn't endorsed the findings in part because of some methodological differences and in part because they weren't given access to the data and the findings to validate them for publication.
Some of the main differences between the two studies are that, first,
IHME calculated new disability weights for various health conditions.
This was done through a participatory online process, as well as through field surveys in number of countries.
Second, while WHO considered hygiene, water and sanitation risks,
IHME found that the data available for hygiene practices, nationally representative data sets were too weak, so they decided not to include this risk factor.
And then finally, in the IHME model, people accessing a basic level of water and sanitation, such as improved sources of water like a borehole or a protective spring, or improved sanitation basic pit nutrim, they were considered to suffer no burden of disease due to their water and sanitation.
This was not the approach followed in the WHO models.
Nonetheless, this was a massive and important undertaking and we can learn a lot through its findings.
Let's take a look at them.
<i>Let's take a look at the GBD 2010 data from the IHME website.</i>
<i>You can find it just by searching IHME.</i>
<i>Then let's go straight to their data visualization.</i>
<i>They have many different visualizations tools.</i>
<i>We'll look at GBD Compare.</i>
<i>Now in GBD compare, this is what's called a tree map</i> and if you hover over different diseases
<i>you can see the percent of their contribution</i>
<i>to the burden of disease.</i>
<i>Here let's put a focus on diarrheal disease,</i>
<i>now that box will always have a square on it,</i>
<i>and we can change between DALYs and deaths,</i>
<i>we can look at global or specific countries or regions,</i>
<i>we can change years,</i>
<i>we can see that if we look at 
"Under five children"</i>
<i>the contribution of diarrheal disease is much larger.</i>
<i>So you can find out a lot of things from this kind of map.</i>
<i>Down below, we have different options for secondary visualizations.</i>
<i>We could look at Time Plot for instance,</i>
<i>and see the number of deaths decreasing over time</i>
<i>here shown as Rates or as Numbers.</i>
<i>Decreasing from 1.7 million under five deaths in 1990</i>
<i>to about 666,000 in 2010.</i>
<i>We can also look at the Map and see which countries have greater</i>
<i>or lesser burdens of disease.</i>
<i>Here we can see that India, who has a 150,000 child deaths</i>
<i>is by far the largest contributor to burden of disease,</i>
<i>but if we look at Rates,</i>
<i>then we would see more high rates in Sub-Saharan Africa</i>
<i>and the same if we look at proportion of DALYs.</i>
What both of these data sets tells us is that the burden of disease from unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene is high and that diarrheal disease is the leading contributor to that disease burden both in terms of morbidity and mortality.
You can now access these reports or websites to get more detailed information if you need.
In our next module, we will be looking at some of the specific pathogens that cause diarrheal disease in drinking water.
