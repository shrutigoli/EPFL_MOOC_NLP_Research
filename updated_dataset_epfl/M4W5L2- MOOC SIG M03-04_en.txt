00:00:29,893 --> 00:00:31,262
Welcome to this lesson

2
00:00:31,462 --> 00:00:33,014
at the top of Mont-Noble

3
00:00:33,214 --> 00:00:35,379
which will focus on visual variables.

4
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:36,900
as we will see it,

5
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:39,918
these variables constitute
the grammar of the image.

6
00:00:41,328 --> 00:00:42,071
Indeed,

7
00:00:42,271 --> 00:00:43,904
we discussed in the previous lesson

8
00:00:44,104 --> 00:00:46,117
the fact that a 
cartographic representation

9
00:00:46,317 --> 00:00:47,648
uses a system of signs

10
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,682
equivalent to a verbal language

11
00:00:49,882 --> 00:00:52,399
to encode information
to be transmitted visually.

12
00:00:52,992 --> 00:00:54,076
The encoding in question

13
00:00:54,276 --> 00:00:56,188
results from the decomposition 
of the image

14
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:57,468
into visual structures,

15
00:00:57,668 --> 00:01:00,589
that are the points, the lines, 
the surfaces and the volumes.

16
00:01:00,789 --> 00:01:01,739
It also results

17
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:04,164
from the variation of
the properties of these structures

18
00:01:04,653 --> 00:01:05,775
and it is these variations

19
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:07,794
that we call visual variables

20
00:01:07,994 --> 00:01:08,983
and whose use

21
00:01:09,183 --> 00:01:11,711
is managed by the rules
of the graphical semiology,

22
00:01:11,911 --> 00:01:13,373
like a grammar of the image.

23
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:15,359
The objectives of this lesson

24
00:01:15,559 --> 00:01:18,074
are to explain Jacques Bertin's 
graphic system

25
00:01:18,274 --> 00:01:20,972
and to detail the list of components
of this system,

26
00:01:21,172 --> 00:01:22,982
so the visual structures,

27
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:24,282
the visual variables,

28
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:25,987
their respective properties

29
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:28,467
and the types of relations
they can transcribe.

30
00:01:29,061 --> 00:01:29,949
They are also

31
00:01:30,149 --> 00:01:31,887
to show for what good reasons

32
00:01:32,087 --> 00:01:34,294
related to the perceptive
capacities of the human being,

33
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:36,822
the graphic rules must be applied.

34
00:01:37,344 --> 00:01:38,970
After following this lesson,

35
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,048
you will be able

36
00:01:40,248 --> 00:01:41,811
to restore the graphic system,

37
00:01:42,011 --> 00:01:43,580
to list and recognize

38
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,335
its components

39
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:47,242
on any thematic map.

40
00:01:57,241 --> 00:01:57,832
Any map

41
00:01:58,032 --> 00:01:59,455
is the result of a representation

42
00:01:59,655 --> 00:02:00,680
or a staging

43
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,877
carried out with given technical means,

44
00:02:03,077 --> 00:02:04,288
for example with a pencil,

45
00:02:04,488 --> 00:02:05,463
a computer,

46
00:02:05,663 --> 00:02:07,525
with color or without color,

47
00:02:07,725 --> 00:02:09,391
and this according to a vision,

48
00:02:09,591 --> 00:02:10,779
a point of view

49
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:12,319
and sometimes an ideology

50
00:02:12,519 --> 00:02:14,382
and of course for a certain purpose.

51
00:02:14,972 --> 00:02:17,459
The map is therefore the equivalent
of a language,

52
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:18,593
as we have seen,

53
00:02:18,793 --> 00:02:20,016
which allows the communication

54
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:21,770
in development of knowledge

55
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:23,159
and by creating information.

56
00:02:23,761 --> 00:02:26,449
To construct and display the map signal,

57
00:02:26,649 --> 00:02:28,028
we use the graph,

58
00:02:28,228 --> 00:02:30,849
a discipline or system developed
by Jacques Bertin

59
00:02:31,049 --> 00:02:33,254
form the 1950s

60
00:02:33,454 --> 00:02:36,315
and which is about the principles
of cartographic information.

61
00:02:36,515 --> 00:02:37,420
Concretely,

62
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:39,189
it is a system of signs

63
00:02:39,414 --> 00:02:41,094
which allows to transcribe

64
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:43,704
difference, order
or proportionality relations

65
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:46,603
between qualitative
or quantitative data

66
00:02:46,803 --> 00:02:49,395
and whose domain extends
to any representation,

67
00:02:49,595 --> 00:02:51,477
using the two dimensions
of the plan.

68
00:03:00,014 --> 00:03:01,344
This system of signs

69
00:03:01,544 --> 00:03:03,008
is used to encode the information

70
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:04,492
that the map must convey.

71
00:03:04,692 --> 00:03:07,567
This system of signs or 
language is graphic

72
00:03:07,767 --> 00:03:09,536
and it implements visual structures.

73
00:03:10,554 --> 00:03:12,784
There are 4 families
of visual structures,

74
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:15,418
or 4 implantations according
to Bertin:

75
00:03:15,618 --> 00:03:21,596
points, lines,
surfaces and volumes.

76
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:25,492
A map contains a set of 
visual structures

77
00:03:25,692 --> 00:03:27,908
which encodes the information 
to be mapped.

78
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,738
Therefore,

79
00:03:29,938 --> 00:03:31,103
the visual structures

80
00:03:31,303 --> 00:03:33,181
are not independent
from one another

81
00:03:33,381 --> 00:03:34,886
and the context matters a lot

82
00:03:35,086 --> 00:03:36,950
for the meaning assigned to them.

83
00:03:37,554 --> 00:03:38,308
This is important

84
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:39,857
because our visual perception

85
00:03:40,057 --> 00:03:41,548
recognizes the models

86
00:03:41,748 --> 00:03:43,544
in a set of visual structures.

87
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:48,300
A theory in the psychology
of the form, the gestalt,

88
00:03:48,974 --> 00:03:51,144
which comes from the german 
"gestaltpsychologie",

89
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:52,793
has developed laws

90
00:03:52,993 --> 00:03:55,382
corresponding to categories
of possible interactions

91
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:56,982
between the visual structures.

92
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,095
The table that will appear on the screen

93
00:04:00,295 --> 00:04:02,081
synthesizes these main laws.

94
00:04:02,603 --> 00:04:04,885
These are important elements to know

95
00:04:05,085 --> 00:04:07,153
and they are easily applicable

96
00:04:07,353 --> 00:04:10,177
during the development of cartographic
representations.

97
00:04:11,067 --> 00:04:12,203
The first law

98
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:13,604
is that of relevancy.

99
00:04:13,804 --> 00:04:15,434
An image is easy to understand

100
00:04:15,634 --> 00:04:16,915
if its structure is simple.

101
00:04:17,614 --> 00:04:18,771
The law of proximity

102
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:21,632
stipulates that two components
which are close

103
00:04:21,832 --> 00:04:24,250
tend to be perceived
as a single component.

104
00:04:24,926 --> 00:04:27,058
Here on the right, the image is 
perceived as two elements.

105
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,977
The law of similarity

106
00:04:29,177 --> 00:04:31,612
is reflected in the fact  that 
similar components

107
00:04:31,812 --> 00:04:33,788
are perceived as if they were
grouped together.

108
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:35,201
Here on the right,

109
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:37,402
the image is perceived
as a series of columns

110
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:39,121
by color similarity.

111
00:04:39,681 --> 00:04:41,152
For the closure law,

112
00:04:41,352 --> 00:04:43,995
the close contours are
perceived as unified.

113
00:04:44,195 --> 00:04:45,385
In the image on the right,

114
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:46,992
we see a white triangle

115
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:48,913
while it is not drawn.

116
00:04:49,591 --> 00:04:51,224
For the continuity law,

117
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:53,847
neighboring elements are
perceived as grouped

118
00:04:54,047 --> 00:04:56,648
when they potentially possess
a trait that connects them.

119
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:58,698
In the illustration on the right,

120
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,288
the image is perceived
as a cross.

121
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:03,093
The law of symmetry says

122
00:05:03,293 --> 00:05:06,003
that elements are perceived
as a global element

123
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:07,742
when they form a symmetry.

124
00:05:07,942 --> 00:05:08,985
In the example here,

125
00:05:09,185 --> 00:05:10,975
the two elements on the left
are not perceived

126
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:12,140
as a single element,

127
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:13,890
unlike the other two.

128
00:05:15,168 --> 00:05:16,908
For the trajectory law,

129
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,258
the elements which move
with the same trajectory

130
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:20,322
appear to be grouped.

131
00:05:20,522 --> 00:05:22,180
And for that of the familiarity,

132
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,649
the elements are more easily grouped

133
00:05:24,849 --> 00:05:27,216
if the grouping characteristic 
is familiar.

134
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:29,661
In addition to interactions

135
00:05:29,861 --> 00:05:31,092
between visual structures,

136
00:05:31,292 --> 00:05:32,869
the graph will make

137
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:34,387
the properties of the latter vary

138
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,920
to encode the information,

139
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,885
for example like

140
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:40,964
changing the color or 
changing the thickness.

141
00:05:41,948 --> 00:05:44,034
These variations
on the visual structures

142
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:45,469
are grouped by type

143
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:47,897
and they are called
the visual variables

144
00:05:48,097 --> 00:05:51,172
or the retinal variables
according to Bertin.

145
00:06:00,149 --> 00:06:02,300
Bertin distinguished
8 visual variables:

146
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,580
the position

147
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,144
which is composed
of the variables X and Y,

148
00:06:06,344 --> 00:06:07,970
so the two dimensions
of the plan.

149
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:10,266
The variation in size

150
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:13,389
which allows to perfectly
translate the quantitative variations.

151
00:06:14,217 --> 00:06:16,317
The change in the value
of a color

152
00:06:16,517 --> 00:06:18,495
is a variation of light intensity

153
00:06:18,695 --> 00:06:21,840
from the brightest to
the darkest or vice versa,

154
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,654
it translates a relation of order

155
00:06:23,854 --> 00:06:25,310
and relative differences.

156
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:30,285
The form expresses the identity of 
the object to be represented

157
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:31,897
and therefore the differences.

158
00:06:32,377 --> 00:06:35,495
The orientation enables
to position a sign

159
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:37,409
with regards to
the two axes of the graph,

160
00:06:37,609 --> 00:06:40,291
it expresses the differences

161
00:06:40,491 --> 00:06:41,883
and gains in efficiency

162
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:45,108
when combined with the
grain and value variables.

163
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:48,149
The color reflects differences

164
00:06:48,349 --> 00:06:50,828
but cannot arrange
these differences between themselves.

165
00:06:51,295 --> 00:06:53,073
The color is charged with

166
00:06:53,273 --> 00:06:54,951
cultural and psychological meanings.

167
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:57,873
The grain or resolution

168
00:06:58,073 --> 00:06:59,627
combines the shape and the size

169
00:06:59,827 --> 00:07:01,242
and translates a relation of order

170
00:07:01,442 --> 00:07:02,994
and relative differences.

171
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,171
The position variables,

172
00:07:06,371 --> 00:07:07,918
the size and the value

173
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:10,607
are called image variables

174
00:07:10,807 --> 00:07:13,773
because they construct
ranges of variable visibility,

175
00:07:13,973 --> 00:07:15,949
they reveal forms on a background,

176
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:17,384
they suggest reliefs.

177
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,980
This variable visibility

178
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,340
is the consequence of the 
dissociative property.

179
00:07:24,814 --> 00:07:27,722
The shape, the orientation, 
the color and the grain,

180
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:29,694
unlike the position variables,

181
00:07:29,894 --> 00:07:30,801
of size and value,

182
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:33,287
that build homogeneous visibility ranges,

183
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:34,718
without relief,

184
00:07:34,918 --> 00:07:37,412
and that merely separate
elements from each other

185
00:07:37,612 --> 00:07:39,774
without making forms
appear on a background.

186
00:07:40,437 --> 00:07:41,515
For these reasons,

187
00:07:41,715 --> 00:07:44,240
these variables are
called separation variables.

188
00:07:45,266 --> 00:07:48,343
This translates an associative property.

189
00:07:49,796 --> 00:07:51,637
When considering surfaces,

190
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:54,152
as is the case
with choropleth thematic maps,

191
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:55,992
and which is relatively
frequent,

192
00:07:56,192 --> 00:07:57,443
we must remember

193
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,022
that the size and value

194
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:01,915
ensure a strong differentiation
between ranges,

195
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,648
that they create a visual order

196
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:06,346
and build hierarchies in the image.

197
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:08,601
The form

198
00:08:08,801 --> 00:08:10,721
does not allow to transcribe
differences.

199
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,707
It is associative

200
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:14,825
and its selectivity is null.

201
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:18,051
The orientation is associative.

202
00:08:18,251 --> 00:08:21,267
It allows to construct
ranges of homogeneous visibility

203
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:24,005
and its selectivity is very low.

204
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,701
The color associated with
the value

205
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:29,427
is highly selective and ordered,

206
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:30,662
but we must remember

207
00:08:30,862 --> 00:08:32,787
that a range of colors of equal value

208
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:35,239
constructs an image without
relief.

209
00:08:36,169 --> 00:08:36,955
Finally,

210
00:08:37,155 --> 00:08:38,570
the grain can be compared

211
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:41,713
to a analogical photographic 
enlargement,

212
00:08:41,913 --> 00:08:43,895
it is therefore associative,

213
00:08:44,095 --> 00:08:46,641
but it can ensure a certain selectivity.

214
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:48,635
It is also ordered.

215
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:50,584
To sum up,

216
00:08:50,784 --> 00:08:53,056
the graphic system
developed by Bertin

217
00:08:53,256 --> 00:08:55,210
considers eight visual variables

218
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:58,230
which can be applied
to three types of implantations:

219
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,368
points, lines
and surfaces.

220
00:09:00,946 --> 00:09:02,110
These visual variables

221
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:04,292
possess five different
properties,

222
00:09:04,492 --> 00:09:09,909
quantitative, ordered, selective,
dissociative and associative,

223
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:13,210
which allows to transcribe
the three types of relations

224
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,158
between the data

225
00:09:14,358 --> 00:09:17,513
that are the proportionality,
the order and the resemblance.

226
00:09:18,268 --> 00:09:19,141
You will notice

227
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:21,237
that we do not consider
the volume

228
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:23,713
or two and a half dimensions 
implantations

229
00:09:23,913 --> 00:09:24,686
in this system.

230
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:35,749
We will now highlight

231
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:38,499
important characteristics of the 
visual variables,

232
00:09:38,699 --> 00:09:41,154
in relation to the capacities 
of perception

233
00:09:41,354 --> 00:09:42,032
of the human being.

234
00:09:42,892 --> 00:09:45,573
These characteristics correspond
to key concepts,

235
00:09:45,773 --> 00:09:47,021
most often linked

236
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:49,027
to "color" and "value" variables,

237
00:09:49,227 --> 00:09:50,867
and rules of use

238
00:09:51,067 --> 00:09:52,951
which give maximum efficiency

239
00:09:53,151 --> 00:09:55,620
to cartographic representations.

240
00:09:56,922 --> 00:09:58,048
Each visual variable

241
00:09:58,248 --> 00:10:00,156
consists of a number
of discrete degrees

242
00:10:00,356 --> 00:10:03,332
a number which is fixed for a 
given graphical representation.

243
00:10:04,242 --> 00:10:05,968
This is the number of
sensitive bearings

244
00:10:06,168 --> 00:10:07,905
that a visual variable
can support.

245
00:10:08,105 --> 00:10:10,877
This number is called
the length of a visual variable.

246
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:14,268
The length is not the same

247
00:10:14,468 --> 00:10:15,974
as the extent of a visual variable.

248
00:10:16,742 --> 00:10:18,935
The extent is the gap

249
00:10:19,135 --> 00:10:21,115
between the extreme values
​​of the parameter

250
00:10:21,315 --> 00:10:22,428
whereas the length

251
00:10:22,628 --> 00:10:24,926
is the number of relevant
subdivisions

252
00:10:25,126 --> 00:10:27,055
which exist along this gap

253
00:10:27,255 --> 00:10:28,340
for a given image.

254
00:10:29,522 --> 00:10:32,129
The form is the longest of
the visual variables,

255
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:34,071
followed by the position.

256
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:36,578
The length of the value

257
00:10:36,778 --> 00:10:38,245
is particularly interesting

258
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:40,627
as it is this that we use

259
00:10:40,827 --> 00:10:42,231
to set a number of classes

260
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:43,970
in the process of discretization

261
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,641
in choropleth mapping.

262
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:48,386
The main thing is to determine

263
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:50,349
thresholds that are perceptible

264
00:10:50,549 --> 00:10:52,867
by the eye of the majority
of users.

265
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:56,342
On this first precipitation
map

266
00:10:56,542 --> 00:10:58,450
in rural communities
in Senegal,

267
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,892
the length of the value
of the grey levels is four,

268
00:11:02,885 --> 00:11:05,324
the interclass thresholds
are clearly perceptible.

269
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,507
The second map

270
00:11:07,707 --> 00:11:09,085
shows the same information,

271
00:11:09,285 --> 00:11:12,310
with a length of the value 
of grey levels of seven.

272
00:11:13,241 --> 00:11:14,060
This time,

273
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:17,348
it is more difficult to perceive
the thresholds between classes

274
00:11:17,548 --> 00:11:19,619
and the signal is less efficient.

275
00:11:21,141 --> 00:11:22,129
As we have seen,

276
00:11:22,342 --> 00:11:24,188
the variation of values
​​is dissociative,

277
00:11:24,388 --> 00:11:25,882
which means that this variable

278
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:27,401
is able to bring out

279
00:11:27,597 --> 00:11:29,099
various visibility ranges.

280
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,734
The value is related
to the notion of luminosity

281
00:11:31,959 --> 00:11:32,929
in the color theory

282
00:11:33,129 --> 00:11:34,953
and we consider that it is 
a perception

283
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:36,983
independent of the chromaticity.

284
00:11:37,838 --> 00:11:39,408
The number of perceptual thresholds

285
00:11:39,608 --> 00:11:41,631
will therefore depend on
the value of the map background

286
00:11:41,831 --> 00:11:44,397
and the size of the graphic 
elements it brings.

287
00:11:44,597 --> 00:11:45,765
We turn ideally

288
00:11:45,965 --> 00:11:47,945
to a maximum of 6
perceptive thresholds,

289
00:11:48,145 --> 00:11:49,933
so a length of seven

290
00:11:50,133 --> 00:11:52,159
as in the example shown a moment ago.

291
00:11:52,951 --> 00:11:54,619
This change in values

292
00:11:54,819 --> 00:11:57,017
will always dominate any other
visual variable

293
00:11:57,217 --> 00:11:58,440
which interferes with it.

294
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,001
The variation of values ​​is
ordered

295
00:12:02,201 --> 00:12:03,855
and not using it as such

296
00:12:04,055 --> 00:12:05,621
generates a semantic problem.

297
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:06,947
For example,

298
00:12:07,147 --> 00:12:08,643
using a grey gradient

299
00:12:08,843 --> 00:12:10,648
to represent
qualitative classes

300
00:12:10,848 --> 00:12:13,745
is an error that compromises
the transmission of the information.

301
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:16,585
Here, the value of grey levels

302
00:12:16,785 --> 00:12:18,289
allocated to the regions
of Senegal

303
00:12:18,489 --> 00:12:20,411
depends on the initial
letter of their names

304
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:21,730
in alphabetical order,

305
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:22,706
it is a mistake.

306
00:12:22,906 --> 00:12:25,514
We will instead use
discrete colors

307
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:27,185
to mark the qualitative aspect,

308
00:12:27,385 --> 00:12:28,830
the non-continuity.

309
00:12:29,492 --> 00:12:30,348
On the other hand

310
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:33,128
an arithmetic progression 
of grey levels

311
00:12:33,328 --> 00:12:35,355
is not equidistant in 
terms of perception.

312
00:12:35,822 --> 00:12:36,511
Indeed,

313
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:38,886
the differences are more
sensitive to the extremities

314
00:12:39,086 --> 00:12:40,572
than at the center of the
distribution.

315
00:12:41,508 --> 00:12:42,673
We will note at this point

316
00:12:42,873 --> 00:12:45,300
that the rule is to keep the white
for the missing data

317
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,284
and that the white 
should not be integrated

318
00:12:47,484 --> 00:12:48,574
as initial class

319
00:12:48,774 --> 00:12:51,405
in a gradation of values ​​
of any kind of shade.

320
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:53,925
Statistical thematic maps

321
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,855
are part of visualization tools

322
00:12:56,055 --> 00:12:57,791
and they are able to assist man

323
00:12:57,991 --> 00:12:59,148
in his reasonings.

324
00:12:59,624 --> 00:13:01,931
They help to improve 
the cognitive process

325
00:13:02,131 --> 00:13:04,271
by playing the role of 
thought support,

326
00:13:04,471 --> 00:13:05,639
but this requires

327
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,794
that an important condition 
is fulfilled:

328
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:08,930
it is necessary for the image

329
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:11,185
to be a significant visual form,

330
00:13:11,385 --> 00:13:13,651
perceptible in the minimum
moment of vision.

331
00:13:14,151 --> 00:13:16,402
A map that requires a shorter 

332
00:13:16,602 --> 00:13:17,631
time of perception than another

333
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:19,425
to transmit an information

334
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:20,651
is more effective.

335
00:13:20,851 --> 00:13:21,972
In this context,

336
00:13:22,172 --> 00:13:23,943
any cartographic representation

337
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:25,858
which has more than three components

338
00:13:26,058 --> 00:13:28,496
cannot be constructed 
as a single image

339
00:13:28,696 --> 00:13:31,477
and will require several
instants of perception,

340
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,021
so the development of several maps.

341
00:13:42,682 --> 00:13:43,404
Here are

342
00:13:43,604 --> 00:13:45,579
some important information to know

343
00:13:45,779 --> 00:13:46,807
concerning the color,

344
00:13:46,982 --> 00:13:49,804
which is the other significant visual
variable with the value

345
00:13:49,992 --> 00:13:51,755
for the production of choropleth 

346
00:13:51,943 --> 00:13:53,218
statistic thematic maps.

347
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:56,532
There are different colorimetric systems

348
00:13:56,732 --> 00:13:59,367
based on the three description 
parameters a color

349
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:03,499
that are the hue,
the saturation and the luminosity.

350
00:14:04,118 --> 00:14:06,392
The hue is the pure form of a color

351
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:07,839
in that it opposes the white,

352
00:14:08,039 --> 00:14:09,374
black and gray.

353
00:14:09,918 --> 00:14:13,349
The saturation expresses
the intensity of the color

354
00:14:13,549 --> 00:14:15,681
compared to the maximum
possible in the system.

355
00:14:16,218 --> 00:14:18,724
The brightness expresses
the impression of clarity

356
00:14:18,924 --> 00:14:20,238
or brightness of the color

357
00:14:20,438 --> 00:14:21,579
and as we have already seen,

358
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:25,433
the luminosity is an independent
perception of the chromaticity.

359
00:14:26,018 --> 00:14:29,164
TSL designates several color
description models

360
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:31,383
which are used in computer graphics

361
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:32,497
and in infography,

362
00:14:32,697 --> 00:14:34,295
the disciplines that are implemented

363
00:14:34,495 --> 00:14:36,384
during the production of thematic maps.

364
00:14:36,858 --> 00:14:38,449
The important thing to remember here

365
00:14:38,649 --> 00:14:41,413
is that it is necessary 
to code the colors on the computer,

366
00:14:41,613 --> 00:14:43,034
so as to be able to designate

367
00:14:43,246 --> 00:14:45,066
the large number of 
possible combinations

368
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:47,839
of hue, saturation and brightness levels

369
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:50,554
and to apply them to visual structures

370
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:53,316
representing the spatial 
units on the maps.

371
00:14:54,111 --> 00:14:55,226
Computer coding

372
00:14:55,439 --> 00:14:56,476
represents colors

373
00:14:56,676 --> 00:14:57,791
with a triplet of values

374
00:14:57,991 --> 00:14:59,973
relating to each of the primary colors

375
00:15:00,161 --> 00:15:01,287
of the additive synthesis,

376
00:15:01,686 --> 00:15:05,437
so the red, the green and 
the blue of the screen.

377
00:15:05,937 --> 00:15:08,217
By the addition of 
these three light beams,

378
00:15:08,417 --> 00:15:09,561
it is possible to obtain

379
00:15:09,761 --> 00:15:11,745
practically all the visible colors.

380
00:15:11,945 --> 00:15:12,883
This method is based

381
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,590
on the trichromatic sensitivity
of the human eye.

382
00:15:16,064 --> 00:15:17,543
The color codes

383
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:20,216
are integers between 0 and 255,

384
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:21,830
so 256 values

385
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:24,017
which can be coded on 
8 bits, so 1 byte.

386
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:25,262
This way, we can creat

387
00:15:25,462 --> 00:15:27,175
more than 16 million color codes.

388
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:29,346
Color coding

389
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:31,190
by the values ​​of the primary colors

390
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:32,372
red, green and blue

391
00:15:32,572 --> 00:15:34,417
has the advantage of being simple

392
00:15:34,617 --> 00:15:35,659
for programming,

393
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:37,227
but it is difficult to manage

394
00:15:37,427 --> 00:15:40,686
for the user who needs
to manipulate simple colors

395
00:15:40,886 --> 00:15:43,934
which allow to manufacture 
distinct readability ranges

396
00:15:44,159 --> 00:15:46,210
to characterize the visual structures.

397
00:15:48,215 --> 00:15:50,003
Here is the parametrization window

398
00:15:50,203 --> 00:15:51,256
which appears in QGIS

399
00:15:51,456 --> 00:15:54,241
when you want to select a filling color.

400
00:15:55,472 --> 00:15:58,115
The first line, H, for hue,

401
00:15:58,846 --> 00:16:00,535
allows you to determine a hue.

402
00:16:00,992 --> 00:16:02,701
The value is given in degrees

403
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:04,625
and corresponds to the position 
of the hue

404
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:07,455
in the chromatic circle represented
on the left.

405
00:16:07,990 --> 00:16:10,931
On the second line, S, for saturation,

406
00:16:11,467 --> 00:16:13,205
you can determine the saturation

407
00:16:13,417 --> 00:16:14,545
for the selected color

408
00:16:14,745 --> 00:16:16,668
between 0 and 100 %.

409
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:18,927
The third line, V,

410
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:20,799
allows the value to be set

411
00:16:20,999 --> 00:16:23,069
between 0 and 100% also.

412
00:16:23,991 --> 00:16:26,063
Changes to these three parameters

413
00:16:26,263 --> 00:16:27,753
are reported automatically

414
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,727
on the corresponding R, V, B values

415
00:16:29,927 --> 00:16:30,970
displayed below

416
00:16:31,170 --> 00:16:35,243
and characterized by numbers
between 0 and 255.

417
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,258
It is still possible to adjust
the transparency

418
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,562
and the system will automatically encode

419
00:16:41,762 --> 00:16:43,969
the HTML notation of 
the selected color.

420
00:16:45,443 --> 00:16:47,355
We note that the number of combinations

421
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:48,283
is enormous

422
00:16:48,483 --> 00:16:50,414
and that the determination
of the parameters

423
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:52,991
allowing to produce 
adequate color ranges

424
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:54,035
is difficult.

425
00:16:54,506 --> 00:16:56,707
So how do we proceed?

426
00:16:57,936 --> 00:16:59,041
The first solution

427
00:16:59,241 --> 00:17:00,561
is to use one or the other

428
00:17:00,761 --> 00:17:03,395
predefined palettes available in QGIS

429
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:04,612
via the "style" tab

430
00:17:04,812 --> 00:17:06,256
in the properties of the layer.

431
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:09,556
But that does not solve all the problems

432
00:17:10,095 --> 00:17:11,632
since the user

433
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,695
must take a number of decisions

434
00:17:13,895 --> 00:17:15,543
relating to the number of classes,

435
00:17:15,743 --> 00:17:18,165
to the nature of the 
statistical distribution

436
00:17:18,365 --> 00:17:21,269
or the types of colors
to use, for example.

437
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,076
There is a very valuable tool

438
00:17:24,276 --> 00:17:26,411
developed at the Penn State University,

439
00:17:26,611 --> 00:17:27,355
in the United States

440
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:28,886
by Cynthia Brewer

441
00:17:29,086 --> 00:17:30,409
of the GeoVISTA Center,

442
00:17:30,609 --> 00:17:32,575
which allows to directly visualize

443
00:17:32,775 --> 00:17:34,694
the effect of the choices
of the selected parameters

444
00:17:34,894 --> 00:17:37,299
on the basis of a series 
of predefined pallets

445
00:17:37,499 --> 00:17:40,653
and which guarantee an 
optimum efficiency,

446
00:17:40,853 --> 00:17:41,823
that is to say the fact

447
00:17:42,023 --> 00:17:43,949
that the combination of visual variables

448
00:17:44,149 --> 00:17:45,065
"hue" and "value"

449
00:17:45,354 --> 00:17:48,212
always allows to distinguish
two successive classes.

450
00:17:49,475 --> 00:17:50,855
Once a palette has been determined,

451
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:52,082
the color brewer

452
00:17:52,282 --> 00:17:54,776
allows to export the corresponding
​​R, V, B values

453
00:17:54,976 --> 00:17:56,948
and to use them in QGIS

454
00:17:57,148 --> 00:18:00,181
to make this palette available
in this software.

455
00:18:01,508 --> 00:18:03,792
We will come back to the use 
of this tool

456
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:05,053
in the next lesson.

457
00:18:05,973 --> 00:18:07,665
Here are some more details

458
00:18:07,865 --> 00:18:09,475
related to the use of the color

459
00:18:09,675 --> 00:18:10,722
and its perception.

460
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,271
The color is highly selective,

461
00:18:13,471 --> 00:18:15,952
it allows better discriminations

462
00:18:16,152 --> 00:18:17,438
in the reds and violets

463
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,372
and less good discriminations

464
00:18:19,572 --> 00:18:20,455
in the yellows.

465
00:18:21,768 --> 00:18:23,095
The color is ordered,

466
00:18:23,295 --> 00:18:25,159
and to transcribe order relations,

467
00:18:25,359 --> 00:18:27,600
it is necessary to take into account
the value visual variable,

468
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,571
so the brightness component of the color

469
00:18:30,771 --> 00:18:32,290
and use a homogeneous shade.

470
00:18:33,211 --> 00:18:34,711
Without variation of the value,

471
00:18:34,911 --> 00:18:37,893
the color is useless to 
the ordered perception.

472
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:41,051
When using different colors,

473
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,838
the value that retranscribes
the order relation

474
00:18:44,038 --> 00:18:46,375
is perceived first before the hue

475
00:18:46,575 --> 00:18:48,109
which allows the selection.

476
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:50,369
But we must take into account

477
00:18:50,569 --> 00:18:52,116
the fact that the color variation

478
00:18:52,316 --> 00:18:54,570
often implies a change in value.

479
00:18:55,402 --> 00:18:56,488
Another point,

480
00:18:56,688 --> 00:18:57,790
the effectiveness of the color

481
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:00,289
decreases with the surface
of the visual structures.

482
00:19:01,114 --> 00:19:01,782
And finally,

483
00:19:01,982 --> 00:19:03,677
We can note that the combination

484
00:19:03,877 --> 00:19:06,703
of the variation of the hue and
the variation of the value

485
00:19:06,903 --> 00:19:08,772
offers more perceptive thresholds.

486
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:10,192
In some cases,

487
00:19:10,392 --> 00:19:13,023
this combination offers undeniable
advantages,

488
00:19:13,223 --> 00:19:15,323
we will be able to increase
the number of classes

489
00:19:15,523 --> 00:19:17,052
and allow a finer reading

490
00:19:17,252 --> 00:19:18,843
of the cartographic image produced.

491
00:19:19,246 --> 00:19:19,993
For example,

492
00:19:20,193 --> 00:19:21,906
this map shows the result

493
00:19:22,106 --> 00:19:23,486
of a recent Swiss vote

494
00:19:23,686 --> 00:19:25,161
on the construction or not

495
00:19:25,374 --> 00:19:26,408
of a second road tube

496
00:19:26,608 --> 00:19:28,112
at the Gothard tunnel in the Alps.

497
00:19:28,592 --> 00:19:29,575
Here the authors

498
00:19:29,775 --> 00:19:30,957
used a green shade

499
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,433
to represent the share of yes

500
00:19:32,633 --> 00:19:34,719
and a red shade to represent
the share of no,

501
00:19:34,919 --> 00:19:36,305
with in both cases

502
00:19:36,505 --> 00:19:37,624
a change in the value

503
00:19:37,824 --> 00:19:39,687
to express the gradation of
the percentage.

504
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,400
The limit between the red
classes and the green classes

505
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,045
is located at the acceptance threshold,

506
00:19:44,245 --> 00:19:45,654
so from 50%.

507
00:19:46,479 --> 00:19:49,125
The use of a single
shade and the variation of its value

508
00:19:49,356 --> 00:19:51,937
would not have allowed
to distinguish 

509
00:19:52,137 --> 00:19:53,774
the diversity of behaviors 
with as much precision.

510
00:19:55,211 --> 00:19:55,993
To sum up,

511
00:19:56,193 --> 00:19:58,861
the main advantage of using color

512
00:19:59,061 --> 00:20:00,506
in cartographic images

513
00:20:00,706 --> 00:20:01,956
is the fact that it is associated

514
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:03,978
to a strong psychological attractiveness

515
00:20:04,178 --> 00:20:07,447
and that it makes the information
easier to remember.

516
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:09,746
On the side of the disadvantages,

517
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,410
we have to note the high cost

518
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:13,248
of diffusion of colored documents

519
00:20:13,434 --> 00:20:15,470
on supports which are not electronic,

520
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:16,656
but above all

521
00:20:16,856 --> 00:20:18,626
the difficulty of taking into account

522
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:21,543
the users who have
perceptions anomalies,

523
00:20:21,983 --> 00:20:23,469
we often talk about color blindness,

524
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:26,155
but it is only one of the seven known
forms

525
00:20:26,355 --> 00:20:27,422
of dischromatopsies

526
00:20:27,622 --> 00:20:30,037
ranging from the total absence
of color vision

527
00:20:30,237 --> 00:20:34,081
to the absence of a retinal
receptors to blue, green or red.

528
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:36,852
The anomaly corresponding
to color blindness

529
00:20:37,052 --> 00:20:38,396
is the deuteranopia

530
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:40,760
and it is the absence in
the retina

531
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,616
of reception cones to green,

532
00:20:42,816 --> 00:20:44,806
meaning that those affected

533
00:20:45,006 --> 00:20:47,329
are unable to differentiate 
the red from the green.

534
00:20:56,787 --> 00:20:58,484
This lesson on the graphic
system

535
00:20:58,684 --> 00:21:00,624
has allowed to identify
its components,

536
00:21:00,824 --> 00:21:02,880
the structures
and the visual variables,

537
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:04,059
their properties,

538
00:21:04,259 --> 00:21:06,046
such as the selectivity
or the associativity,

539
00:21:06,246 --> 00:21:08,697
as well as the relations
which they permit to transcribe,

540
00:21:08,897 --> 00:21:10,363
that is to say the proportionality,

541
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:12,477
the order or the resemblance.

542
00:21:12,977 --> 00:21:15,607
We have seen that the use of
these components

543
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:16,581
is not trivial

544
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:19,585
and that the use of the visual
variable of the color

545
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:21,261
is particularly delicate

546
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:22,932
because of its complexity,

547
00:21:23,132 --> 00:21:25,210
but facilitated by some tools

548
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:27,597
to assist with the selection of
suitable palettes.

549
00:21:28,567 --> 00:21:30,319
Some rules must be respected

550
00:21:30,519 --> 00:21:31,881
in order to make the best use of

551
00:21:32,081 --> 00:21:34,187
the perceptual capacities of users

552
00:21:34,387 --> 00:21:36,637
and thus to ensure a 
unique and effective

553
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:39,202
transmission of the information.

554
00:21:40,206 --> 00:21:41,592
These theoretical knowledge

555
00:21:41,792 --> 00:21:43,120
are only to be applied

556
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,589
and from the next lesson,

557
00:21:44,789 --> 00:21:46,976
devoted to the treatment of
thematic attributes

558
00:21:47,176 --> 00:21:48,035
and to the class setting,

559
00:21:48,235 --> 00:21:49,255
we will create

560
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:51,831
statistical thematic maps in QGIS.
