Hello and welcome to this lesson which will today be dedicated to a quick presentation on governance of protected areas.
Governance is of course a decisive factor in explaining the successes but also the failures of protected areas.
To find out more, it might be helpful to refer to the guidelines published by the World Commission on Protected Areas.
In particular for this lesson, look at the first chapter of the document which explains the relationship between the definition of categories of protected areas, that we have already seen, and governance, and which rapidly also identifies some important concepts to be familiar with this subject.
Other interesting documents to consult the 84th edition of the NAPA letters, which summarizes a study by PAPACO conducted in French-speaking Africa on the conditions of governance of protected areas.
This study and this letter are available in full as usual at papaco.org.
As announced, Paul NDiaye will be helping me throughout this module.
So, the notion of governance is a difficult concept to define and focuses more on who manages the protected area than what managers actually do.
We often talk about the quality of governance: what we call good governance.
As we have already mentioned, the types of governance were established historically, based on dirigiste settings, but over time, we have moved from a philosophy of preservation, based on the exclusion of residents, to a philosophy more oriented towards the sustainable use of resources linking the population to conservation, or sometimes, the private sector.
We have therefore expanded the list of actors involved in the management of protected areas.
Of course that is not always possible everywhere, it is important to remember, but it is nevertheless the current trend.
Let's listen to an account on this subject from Senegal.
Governance is already a vague concept, when applied on a local scale, such as a protected area.
It defines the way the exercise of power is structured.
Furthermore, there are mechanisms and frameworks which define the arrangements for the participation of different actors.
In Senegal, we can say that this governance has been dynamic.
And all over Africa, we can see cases of delegation, simply through the creation and implementation of tools for management.
So we talk of participatory governance with more and more actor participation or with the involvement of other actors, who can be private actors or others.
In any case,aspects of decentralization are strong elements in the dynamic of protected areas governance in Senegal and in other places in Africa.
Governance intends to be effective and efficient and when we talk of governance, we think of an ideal, which means that there are many elements which must figure in this model.
A good state presence, the absence of corruption... sustainable management of resources, but also sound planning documents, which express the effectiveness of the governance of protected areas.
That said, what does this governance relate to in the context stricto sensu of protected areas and what applications can be drawn from it?
The governance of protected areas leads us to questions of power, relations and responsibilities.
From a practical point of view, we are able to understand this by asking this question:
Who has the authority and the responsibility for managing, and must report what has been achieved?
It has little to do with managing, which is â€œwhat to do to achieve the goals of the protected areaâ€�.
But it tells us about the decision-makers and those ultimately responsible and what has been done or not been done for the protected area.
Governance also can also answers the following important questions:
How are decisions for the protected area made?
What norms are applied?
Which approaches, values and principles serve as a guide for the decision makers?
The answers to these questions and others inform us about the quality of governance.
It helps us understand if we are dealing with good governance or not.
IUCN defines four broad types of governance of protected areas, which will allow us to define the framework.
Let's look at these types with Paul.
We do indeed have four types of governance, all of them are legitimate and important for conservation.
Protected areas, under the authority of the government whether at regional, national level, or at supranational level, are an example of governance by the government.
Protected areas under the authority of several interested parties, is what we call shared governance.
Protected areas under the authority of the private sector, that is, in general, landowners or owners of the natural resources concerned, we call that private governance.
And finally, protected areas under the authority of indigenous people or local communities, whether settled and/or mobile, with common law and/or legal rights, this is called governance by indigenous peoples and local communities.
We will look at each of these types of governance one by one in the following sequences.
A general description, an overview is also given in chapter 4 of the guidelines.
You can see how these different types of governance are organized into a sort of continuum.
It ranges from a governance, essentially in the hands of the state, here on the left, which as we have said, concerns the majority of national parks in
Africa, for example to a governance of protected areas in which the state is no longer involved, at least in theory.
We can find this here, on the right.
These are in general private protected areas or community protected areas, where the rights have been transferred to the local actors.
At this stage, we can examine what we gain from this classification.
We observed in unit one that the protected areas are arranged into six categories, one, two, three, four, five, six, that we already know and which are now here on the left.
We can see that they are also broken down into four types of governance.
All that can therefore be easily summarized in a comprehensive table, that you can see here, containing 24 boxes, a sort of matrix, which describes all the types of protected areas, that you can find.
So for example a park of category II, a type of national park, managed by the state will be found in this box, whilst a sacred site, whose access is forbidden by the community to preserve the environment in its natural state, of category I, will be here.
Another site, managed by indigenous people for example, where there is sustainable fishing, so a category VI, will be here.
This matrix helps us to categorize protected areas that we come across and eventually to form useful groups, for example, to organize meetings and training for managers, who share the same preoccupations in terms of management and governance.
Unfortunately, protected area governance is rarely listed in the world protected areas databases.
Present estimations relate therefore to less than 30% of protected areas in Africa.
The results give us at least 80% are state protected areas, in blue on this map, we can see them all over.
The rest, a small percentage of PAs, of shared governance or community governance, or private governance.
And we can see here, this varies depending on the region.
In general, state protected areas are the largest, as we have said, and the private ones are mostly found in English-speaking
Africa.
This map here summarizes all that, but keep in mind that the vast majority of protected areas in Africa has no type of governance assigned to it here.
If we do not yet know all the types of governance at a continental scale, we know, on the other hand, that governance evolves.
It is in fact obvious that no type of governance is unchanging.
Changes in status happen over time, which force changes to occur that result from a concern to improve governance to create efficient conservation conditions
Governance can be learned, can be experimented with and can be tested and certainly other models still need to be invented to address the challenges of today and the future of our protected areas.
Going into detail on the different types of governance, in our next sequences, we will be able to better reflect on that.
You must understand that governance and above all its quality, is a determining element of the ability, or lack thereof, of a protected area to play its role.
If governance is lacking even if the best management strategies are put in place, results will be mediocre, or even nonexistent.
Management is the easiest to master as we now have most of the technical solutions for the parks.
There are 1000 examples of protected areas that could do infinitely better than they are doing, if only they changed their governance and of course those who manage it,
This brings us back to the notion of responsibility that we have raised whilst studying categories.
Think carefully about this and ask yourselves for the sites that you are familiar with, in what way could a simple change of manager change their results radically.
We are at the end of this lesson.
The next episode will be about protected areas governed by government
Have a good day.
