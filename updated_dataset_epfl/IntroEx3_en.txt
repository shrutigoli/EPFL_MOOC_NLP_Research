Welcome to the exercises for the third week of the course on plasma physics and applications.
During this week's lectures, you have learned about the waves which can exist in a cold uniform plasma with a constant magnetic field.
In the first exercise this week, you will include the effect of collisions in case of an unmagnetized plasma and determine how this changes the dynamics of the plasma waves.
You now also have all the prerequisites to derive an interesting phenomenon called Faraday rotation.
It occurs if an electromagnetic wave propagates through a magnetized plasma and this will be the topic of the second exercise of this week.
I wish you good luck.
