Here we are at module number 2 where we will approach the law of hydrostatics or Pascal's law. This result will be fundamental as it is the cornerstone of fluid mechanics. Pascal's law is due to the french philosopher Pascal back in 1648, it is one of the first results, it is prior to Bernoulli's principle that we will see afterwards, it is prior to the notion of viscosity due to Newton that we have seen in chapter number 1. Here, I will give a definition of the pressure, the computation of the pressure force, an introduction that will be a modern version of Pascal's law.
To prove this result, I will consider a fluid at rest in a Cartesian coordinate system x,z. I will consider an elementary volume, here to simplify things, I will consider that I am working in 2 dimensions so in this case here my volume is a square. The sides of the square here, so length dx will be also equal to the length dz, this square is composed of 4 sides, 1, 2, 3 and 4. As previously I will orientate each of my sides with a normal orientated from the inside towards the outside, each normal of the sides will be denoted by the letter n.
I will now do the force balance exerted on this infinitesimal volume of control. We will have two types of forces, we will have volume forces within this elementary volume, these forces will be here only the weight that I call here dP. This weight is simply the density multiplied by the gravity, multiplied by the volume. We will then have surface forces exerted on this volume of control and these surface forces will be the pressure forces. We will consider first of all what is happening for the side number 1, we have this computed the pressure force applied here here in x + dx. For my side number 1, I am placing myself in x + dx, the average height here is equal to z and if you recall the definition of the pressure force, the infinitesimal force of pressure, it is thus equal to a pressure multiplied by a surface area, as I am here in dimension
2 my surface element it will here be a dz, as I was cautious to orientate my normal form the inside towards the outside I here have a sign -. The projection of n on the x axis gives me here 1. The pressure force dF1 which is being applied like this is thus equal to -p(x+dx,z)dz,
I will renew this calculation here for each of the sides 2, 3 and 4. There are no difficulties to this. For example,  for the side number
2, the normal is always orientated in this case here from the inside towards the outside, which means here that in the direction of increasing z, so I will always have a projection here which is equal to 1,  following my convention of sign here,
I have a -, the pressure is computed in z
+ dz at an average abscissa equal to x. The elementary pressure force applied here dF2 is equal to -p(x, z+dz)dx. If now
I do my force balance and that I project this force balance on the x axis and on the z axis, for the x axis I will have a force like this applied along 1, a force like that applied on 3 and no other volume forces applied in the direction x, the force which is here of pressure must counterbalance exactly the force which is here, when we look mathematically what is going on, it simply means that the pressure is independent of the position x. However, if I now work along the z axis, I will find my two pressure forces that are applied here in this direction, here in this direction, that we will find also here. I also have the own weight of the fluid here which is exerting a force here in the decreasing z.
I have this relation here. If now
I rearrange my terms by dividing here by dxdz, I obtain the following relation. If I do a Taylor expansion at the order
1, so by taking the limit of dz that tends to 0, I see here that I have a definition of the differential of p with respect to z as p does not depend on x, I can replace directly this differential by a right derivative and so here I have dp/dz which is equal the specific weight of the fluid: - Ï�g.
This result here is extremely important, it is called "Pascal's Law" or the law of hydrostatics. The most simple case, is the case of a liquid for which we will have a constant density, in this case here we will have a result extremely interesting, a liquid will have here a free surface and if I integrate the density,
Ï� will be constant, and if I integrate Pascal's law, what I will obtain is that the pressure variation depends only on the height difference between two points of measure, here I will have a free surface that will always be plane and if I place myself along this line situated at a distance h and parallel to the free surface, the pressure here will be identical and equal to Ï�gh. Whatever the shape of the pot, the container, the shape of what is beneath, the pressure here is identical and equal to Ï�gh. The other result which is true for fluids either compressible or incompressible, is the generalization of Pascal's law, tensor generalization, we will replace the right derivative by a gradient term, we will replace the density here by Ï�g, g being written as a vector. Here, we have the law of hydrostatics in vector form or tensor form.
In the case where the fluid is a compressible gas, for example air and we apply the approximation of ideal gases, we have in this case here the ideal gas law that applies and so that states that the pressure and the density of the fluid are linked, among other things, if I am working at constant temperature, all that I will have is that the density of the fluid is proportional to the pressure divided by RT. If I take Pascal's law that I substitute the density for p/RT and that I integrate this differential equation of first order by taking as a boundary condition that the pressure at the height z=0 is equal to the atmospheric pressure,
I obtain the following exponential law that is called the barometric formula and that simply states that the pressure will vary exponentially with the height as long as the temperature is assumed to be constant, which remains an approximation of what happens in reality. During this second module, we have seen Pascal's law which is the most important element and which will be the cornerstone, the key element that will allow us to build the remaining of the course of fluid mechanics.
During the next module, we will see
Archimedes principle that can often allow much faster to the calculation of the pressure force but that unfortunately does not apply to all cases. 
We will see an application example particularly important which is the calculation of pressure forces on a dam.
