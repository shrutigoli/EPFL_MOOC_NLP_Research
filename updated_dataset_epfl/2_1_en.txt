Welcome to Chapter 2 : 
"Numerical differentiation".
Today we'll discuss the following problems :
First-order numerical derivative : we'll deal with truncation error of Taylor series, and we'll talk about round-off errors.
Then we'll discuss numerical
differientiation of order 2 so we'll have to know first-order finite difference formula and a second-order finite difference formula.
So the book chapters we'll deal with are chapters 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4.
