Now we'll solve the problem with n=2.
We have three pairwise distinct values t0, t1, t2 from which we'll construct Ï†0, Ï†1, Ï†2 the Lagrange basis for degree 2 polynomials, associated with t0, t1, t2.
Those three functions 
Ï†0, Ï†1 and Ï†2
Are 3 polynomials of degree 2 built as follows : 
Here are our points t0,  t1, t2 the first polynomial Ï†0 is a degree 2 polynomial such that
Ï†0(t0) = 1, Ï†0(t1) = 0 and Ï†0(t2)=0
We can draw this Ï†0 and we can even write a formula for Ï†0 since it is zero at t1 and t2, so we can write it as
(t-t1)*(t-t2) and I want it to be equal to 1 at t0 so I divide it by (t0-t1)*(t0-t2).
So we get the formula for Ï†0
Likewise I can build the polynomial 
Ï†1, degree 2 polynomial such that
Ï†1(t0)=0 Ï†1(t1)=1 Ï†1(t2)=0
So here is the polynomial Ï†1 and again we have a formula for
Ï†1 which is 
(t-t0)*(t-t2) to get 0 at t0 and t2 and I want it to equal 1 at t1 so I divide it by
(t1-t0)*(t1-t2).
Finally we can build
Ï†2 of degree 2 such that
Ï†2(t0)=0 Ï†2(t1)=0 Ï†2(t2)=1 and we get an analogue formula.
I now claim that those 3 functions
Ï†0, Ï†1, Ï†2 are a basis for the set of polynomials of degree
2 or less. Indeed we have three functions in 
P2 the set of degree 2 polynomials.
The dimension of the space of degree 2 polynomials is 3.
Why 3 ?
Because if p is a degree 2 polynomial, write it a0+a1*t+a2*t^2.
So {1, t, t^2} is the canonical basis for the degree 2 polynomials.
There are 3 elements in this basis so the dimension of P2 is 3
Hence the only thing to check to get that Ï†0, Ï†1, Ï†2 are a basis is that those three functions are linearly independent, so
I take 3 coefficients Î±0, Î±1, Î±2 and I write the linear combination and suppose this equals 0.
I have to show that this implies that all coefficients
Î±0, Î±1, Î±2 are 0.
To show this, it suffices to take t=t0 to get Î±0=0 t=t1 to get Î±1=0 and t=t2 to get Î±2=0. so those 3 functions are linearly independent which means that if p is a degree 2 polynomial, we can write p(t) as a linear combination if those 
3 functions
Î±0Ï†0(t) +Î±1Ï†1(t) +Î±2Ï†2(t)
Now I will give the solution of the problem.
Recall I am looking for a degree 2 polynomial that goes through the points 
(t0,p0), (t1,p1), (t2,p2). The solution is just a linear combination of 
Ï†0, Ï†1 and Ï†2, and the coefficients of this linear combination are p0, p1 and p2. So p(t)=p0*Ï†(t)+p1*Ï†(t)+p2*Ï†(t).
We can easily check that this is the solution to our problem. p is a degree 2 polynomial, because it is a linear combination of those 3 functions, Ï†0, Ï†1 and Ï†2.
And one can check that for example p(t0)=p0. Why ?  
Because Ï†0(t0)=1 and then p1*Ï†1(t0)=0. and p2*Ï†2(t0)=0. so we indeed have p(t0)=p0.
Likewise p(t1)=p1 and p(t2)=p2.
