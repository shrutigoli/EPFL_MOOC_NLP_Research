00:00:31,394 --> 00:00:33,216
Hello and welcome to this lesson

2
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:35,036
which is about the spatial arrangement

3
00:00:35,236 --> 00:00:36,417
and the spatial neighborhood

4
00:00:36,617 --> 00:00:37,762
of discrete variables

5
00:00:37,962 --> 00:00:39,508
presented in the previous lesson.

6
00:00:40,412 --> 00:00:41,876
Arrangement and neighborhood

7
00:00:42,076 --> 00:00:43,972
are notions that allow to describe

8
00:00:44,172 --> 00:00:46,234
the remarkable properties
of a set of objects

9
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:47,666
by means of indicators

10
00:00:47,866 --> 00:00:48,940
whilst so far,

11
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:52,238
we have characterized the spatial
units taken individually.

12
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:55,761
By means of arrangement 
and neighborhood,

13
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:58,211
we can thus analyze 
the spatial relations

14
00:00:58,411 --> 00:01:00,357
between several groups 
of spatial objects.

15
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:03,109
The analysis of these relations
is necessary

16
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:05,143
for example during the search

17
00:01:05,343 --> 00:01:06,993
of the optimal location of a hospital,

18
00:01:07,482 --> 00:01:08,865
an operation during which

19
00:01:09,065 --> 00:01:10,177
we will seek to determine

20
00:01:10,377 --> 00:01:12,156
the area of ​​influence 
of the institution

21
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:13,932
as well as its accessibility.

22
00:01:15,164 --> 00:01:16,140
The goals of this lesson

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,569
are to present the notions

24
00:01:17,769 --> 00:01:19,979
of spatial arrangement
and neighborhood

25
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:22,650
and to describe different indicators

26
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:24,219
of groups of spatial objects.

27
00:01:24,419 --> 00:01:26,707
And this so that
at the end of this lesson,

28
00:01:26,907 --> 00:01:29,182
you are able to select from them

29
00:01:29,382 --> 00:01:31,601
the best index of spatial arrangement

30
00:01:31,801 --> 00:01:32,929
or neighborhood arrangement 
according to your needs

31
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:34,139
and of course also

32
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:36,342
to calculate the value of that index.

33
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,972
The spatial arrangement

34
00:01:49,172 --> 00:01:51,162
is the relative organization of objects

35
00:01:51,362 --> 00:01:52,639
in the geographical space.

36
00:01:53,176 --> 00:01:53,869
In that case,

37
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:57,147
the emphasis is on the fields
of influence of objects.

38
00:01:57,871 --> 00:01:59,471
The neighborhood must be understood

39
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:02,256
in a geometric and topological sense,

40
00:02:02,734 --> 00:02:04,661
so the set of relations perceived

41
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:06,614
which allow us to locate objects

42
00:02:06,814 --> 00:02:08,141
from each another.

43
00:02:08,724 --> 00:02:11,135
The neighborhood is thus 
a spatial notion

44
00:02:11,335 --> 00:02:13,032
which allows to answer the question

45
00:02:13,232 --> 00:02:15,621
of who is next to who.

46
00:02:16,089 --> 00:02:17,236
With the neighborhood,

47
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:18,828
we will work with the concept

48
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,440
of object distances from each other.

49
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,417
The central point

50
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:24,384
of arrangement and neighborhood notions

51
00:02:24,597 --> 00:02:26,960
lies in the nature of 
the geographical space

52
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:29,900
in relation to a 
considered phenomenon.

53
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,471
A distance for example

54
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:33,852
depends on the means of transport used

55
00:02:34,052 --> 00:02:35,766
and the characteristics of the journey

56
00:02:35,966 --> 00:02:37,334
if we take into account

57
00:02:37,534 --> 00:02:39,396
the slope or the quality of the road.

58
00:02:40,773 --> 00:02:43,552
From the point of view of
the geographical space modeling,

59
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:45,714
in this lesson we consider

60
00:02:45,914 --> 00:02:47,468
only the geometric dimension,

61
00:02:47,668 --> 00:02:50,176
without taking into account
the thematic dimension.

62
00:02:50,464 --> 00:02:53,859
The space is therefore plane,
homogeneous and isotropic.

63
00:02:54,346 --> 00:02:55,177
In this context,

64
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:57,210
arrangement and spatial neighborhood

65
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,825
are described by three criteria:

66
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:02,995
the position, the dispersion 
and the proximity,

67
00:03:03,195 --> 00:03:04,769
that we will address

68
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:08,761
in the case of punctual,
surface and linear objects.

69
00:03:18,810 --> 00:03:20,624
In the case of punctual objects,

70
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:22,818
there is no need to treat separately

71
00:03:23,018 --> 00:03:24,488
the object or image modes.

72
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:26,905
The spatial distribution indicators

73
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:28,707
which are now presented

74
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:30,834
are described in object mode.

75
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:33,033
We will use the distribution

76
00:03:33,233 --> 00:03:36,021
of the twelve punctual objects
that are displayed here in red

77
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:37,963
to illustrate these indicators.

78
00:03:38,571 --> 00:03:39,902
We begin with

79
00:03:40,102 --> 00:03:41,567
the position indices.

80
00:03:41,767 --> 00:03:42,400
There are two.

81
00:03:42,975 --> 00:03:45,178
The first is the average center

82
00:03:45,378 --> 00:03:48,537
which is defined by
the mean coordinates of X and Y.

83
00:03:49,156 --> 00:03:50,829
The average center is also called

84
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:53,756
center of gravity or barycenter.

85
00:03:53,956 --> 00:03:56,188
The second is the median center.

86
00:03:56,388 --> 00:03:59,695
It is defined by the medians
of the coordinates of X and Y.

87
00:04:00,417 --> 00:04:01,808
This index is more robust

88
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:02,908
than the average center

89
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:04,458
because it is less influenced

90
00:04:04,658 --> 00:04:07,127
by positions whose coordinates 
are extreme.

91
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:08,292
Let's move on

92
00:04:08,547 --> 00:04:10,402
to statistical indices of dispersion.

93
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:12,961
The dispersion is described in particular

94
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:15,946
by the standard deviation S
of the coordinates of X and Y.

95
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,795
These two intervals

96
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:18,873
delimit a zone

97
00:04:19,073 --> 00:04:21,793
whose interpretation depends
on the phenomenon being studied.

98
00:04:23,141 --> 00:04:25,416
The dispersion can also be described

99
00:04:25,616 --> 00:04:27,871
by a common measure in X and Y

100
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:29,630
in relation to the average center

101
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,921
and which is called standard distance DS,

102
00:04:33,121 --> 00:04:34,840
or Bachi distance.

103
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,396
The DS radius

104
00:04:36,596 --> 00:04:37,929
is obtained by adding

105
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:41,009
the sum of the deviations from
the mean of the square longitudes

106
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:44,563
to the sum of the deviations
from the mean of the square latitudes,

107
00:04:44,763 --> 00:04:47,489
divided by the number 
of points considered.

108
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:49,447
The advantage of this approach

109
00:04:49,647 --> 00:04:51,423
is to propose a unique descriptor

110
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:54,295
for the two axes of coordinates 
X and Y.

111
00:04:54,775 --> 00:04:56,299
The spatial arrangement indices

112
00:04:56,499 --> 00:04:57,523
of punctual objects

113
00:04:57,723 --> 00:04:59,092
are very important tools

114
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:01,563
to ensure geographical representativeness

115
00:05:01,763 --> 00:05:02,805
of a sampling.

116
00:05:04,152 --> 00:05:05,161
For cost reasons,

117
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:06,903
we limit ourselves most often

118
00:05:07,103 --> 00:05:09,317
to raise the values
​​in some points of the space

119
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,975
which are considered representative

120
00:05:11,175 --> 00:05:14,244
instead of measuring a continuous
or discontinuous phenomenon

121
00:05:14,444 --> 00:05:15,666
in any point in space.

122
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,156
Here, as a first step,

123
00:05:18,356 --> 00:05:20,183
we characterize the distribution

124
00:05:20,383 --> 00:05:22,075
of sampling points

125
00:05:22,275 --> 00:05:24,026
by an index of the nearest neighbor

126
00:05:24,226 --> 00:05:25,611
called R index.

127
00:05:27,204 --> 00:05:30,045
This index compares
an observed distribution of points

128
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:31,522
to a random distribution.

129
00:05:32,086 --> 00:05:33,688
The R index is the ratio

130
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:36,108
between the average distance
to the nearest neighbor

131
00:05:36,308 --> 00:05:39,205
and the average distance
for a random distribution.

132
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,450
And here

133
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,863
D from I is the distance from point I
to its nearest neighbor,

134
00:05:44,534 --> 00:05:45,941
S is the area of ​​the study area

135
00:05:46,141 --> 00:05:48,205
and N is the number of measuring points.

136
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:53,546
There are a number
of typical spatial distributions

137
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:55,379
that we are likely to encounter

138
00:05:55,579 --> 00:05:57,875
in the case where the area
of ​​the sampled domain

139
00:05:58,075 --> 00:05:58,726
is known.

140
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,042
These are the group distribution
for which R is equal to 0,

141
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:07,292
the random distribution
for which R is equal to 1

142
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:11,119
and we also have systematic
spatial distributions

143
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:14,845
which correspond to
a given sampling strategy,

144
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,718
for example, performed 
along transects,

145
00:06:17,918 --> 00:06:19,590
either along directional axes,

146
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:21,197
or along contour lines,

147
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:22,793
or finally,

148
00:06:22,993 --> 00:06:24,879
a systematic spatial distribution

149
00:06:25,091 --> 00:06:26,948
for which sampling is carried out

150
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:28,277
in a regular mesh.

151
00:06:29,204 --> 00:06:30,546
When we seek to characterize

152
00:06:30,746 --> 00:06:32,935
the spatial distribution
of a cloud of points,

153
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:34,693
we should also be interested

154
00:06:34,893 --> 00:06:36,866
in the relations that
exist between them

155
00:06:37,066 --> 00:06:38,702
and the neighborhood relation

156
00:06:38,902 --> 00:06:41,278
which we already discussed
in module 1 is one of them.

157
00:06:42,329 --> 00:06:44,859
The neighborhood is defined
by the minimum distance

158
00:06:45,059 --> 00:06:47,042
to one or more objects.

159
00:06:47,572 --> 00:06:50,299
This distance can be 
expressed continuously,

160
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:51,252
like here on the screen,

161
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:54,182
in image mode, the color of each pixel

162
00:06:54,382 --> 00:06:56,291
expresses the distance to the nearest point.

163
00:06:57,145 --> 00:06:58,477
The distance can also be

164
00:06:58,677 --> 00:07:00,399
expressed discreetly.

165
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:02,107
We will seek to represent

166
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:04,171
the areas in which all the points

167
00:07:04,371 --> 00:07:06,089
are closer to a particular object

168
00:07:06,289 --> 00:07:07,290
than of all the others.

169
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:08,321
In that case,

170
00:07:08,521 --> 00:07:11,825
the space is divided
into Thiessen's polygons.

171
00:07:12,415 --> 00:07:14,740
To build Thiessen's polygons,

172
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,782
we use a triangulated network, TIN,

173
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:20,570
for Triangulated Irregular Network,

174
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,881
which is constructed by connecting 
the support points with each other

175
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:27,207
so as to form a triangular mesh network.

176
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,183
A TIN verified according
to the Delaunay criterion

177
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:31,550
respects the rule

178
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,033
according to which the circumscribed
circle of each of the triangles

179
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:37,121
contains no other points.

180
00:07:37,945 --> 00:07:39,863
From the triangulated network,

181
00:07:40,063 --> 00:07:41,645
we will build the mediators

182
00:07:41,845 --> 00:07:43,293
of each of the sides of the triangles

183
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:45,820
and the intersection between the mediators

184
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:48,562
defines the vertices
of Thiessen's polygons.

185
00:07:50,103 --> 00:07:51,403
Thiessen's polygons

186
00:07:51,603 --> 00:07:53,883
are also called Voronoi's diagrams,

187
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:55,267
Voronoi's decompositions,

188
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:57,121
Voronoi's partitions

189
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:59,644
or Voronoi's polygons

190
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:03,523
or Dirichlet's tessellations.

191
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,368
Let us now turn to the analysis

192
00:08:16,568 --> 00:08:18,650
of the spatial arrangement and
neighborhood

193
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,336
of linear objects.

194
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,770
Linear objects generally
represent a network,

195
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:25,251
a hydro-graphic network

196
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:26,871
or a road network for example.

197
00:08:27,159 --> 00:08:29,157
There are several descriptors

198
00:08:29,357 --> 00:08:31,221
of the spatial arrangement
and neighborhood

199
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:32,345
of this type of objects.

200
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:34,921
To start,

201
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:36,688
the average size Tm

202
00:08:36,888 --> 00:08:38,185
is defined by the ratio

203
00:08:38,385 --> 00:08:41,448
between the total length of
chains and the number of chains.

204
00:08:41,648 --> 00:08:43,836
Note that the red dots here

205
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:45,719
connect segments of the same chain.

206
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:49,570
The spatial density index D

207
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,853
is the ratio

208
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:53,639
between the total length of the network

209
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,524
and the area of ​​the zone
under consideration.

210
00:08:57,826 --> 00:09:00,540
The index C of connectivity

211
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:03,498
reflects the degree of complexity
of a network.

212
00:09:04,295 --> 00:09:06,060
It is equal to the number of chains

213
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,903
divided by a denominator

214
00:09:08,103 --> 00:09:11,113
which expresses the number of combinations
two by two between the nodes,

215
00:09:11,313 --> 00:09:12,741
but this without taking into account

216
00:09:12,941 --> 00:09:14,817
the fact that the segment
is connected or not.

217
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:18,025
Here the index is 0.15

218
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,254
since C is equal

219
00:09:19,454 --> 00:09:22,805
to 8 chains divided by 0.5 
times 11 nodes

220
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:23,613
times 10.

221
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,388
The minimum distance index

222
00:09:26,588 --> 00:09:27,864
is defined in the same way

223
00:09:28,064 --> 00:09:29,665
as for punctual objects.

224
00:09:30,227 --> 00:09:31,118
In image mode,

225
00:09:31,318 --> 00:09:32,734
the color of each pixel

226
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:34,907
expresses the distance 
to the nearest pixel

227
00:09:35,107 --> 00:09:36,583
belonging to a segment.

228
00:09:38,059 --> 00:09:40,642
Areas of closer proximity to chains

229
00:09:40,842 --> 00:09:42,689
are also constructed in the same way

230
00:09:42,889 --> 00:09:44,199
as for punctual objects,

231
00:09:45,078 --> 00:09:47,950
so on the basis of
an irregular triangular network

232
00:09:48,694 --> 00:09:50,166
built on the basis of the nodes,

233
00:09:50,366 --> 00:09:53,250
then using the intersection of the mediators

234
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,593
of the sides of the triangles

235
00:09:54,793 --> 00:09:57,304
to obtain the vertices of
Thiessen's polygons.

236
00:10:08,467 --> 00:10:10,839
The review of the arrangement 
and neighborhood

237
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,873
of surface or zonal objects

238
00:10:13,073 --> 00:10:14,790
is very useful in landscape analysis.

239
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:18,232
The idea is to characterize
the observed arrangements

240
00:10:18,432 --> 00:10:20,939
in reference to categories 
of size, shape,

241
00:10:21,448 --> 00:10:22,891
to thematic categories,

242
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:24,954
perhaps even a combination of these.

243
00:10:25,951 --> 00:10:28,669
We will examine the 
arrangement of objects,

244
00:10:28,869 --> 00:10:31,652
either by thematic classes or categories,

245
00:10:31,852 --> 00:10:33,720
or for all the classes combined.

246
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:36,748
The arrangement here
is synonymous with structure

247
00:10:36,948 --> 00:10:38,988
and that is why the 
corresponding indices

248
00:10:39,188 --> 00:10:41,200
are called structural indices.

249
00:10:42,478 --> 00:10:43,369
We propose here

250
00:10:43,569 --> 00:10:45,297
a selection of structural indices

251
00:10:45,497 --> 00:10:46,724
in landscape analysis.

252
00:10:47,394 --> 00:10:48,570
There are three types.

253
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,866
The first type, called patch,

254
00:10:53,398 --> 00:10:55,824
is centered on each surface object

255
00:10:56,024 --> 00:10:57,010
of the study area.

256
00:11:00,089 --> 00:11:03,237
The second type, called class,

257
00:11:04,153 --> 00:11:06,437
considers all the zonal objects

258
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:08,278
assigned to the same category.

259
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:15,169
Finally, the third type, 
called landscape,

260
00:11:15,755 --> 00:11:17,960
covers the entire study area.

261
00:11:19,286 --> 00:11:21,183
You should note that these various indices

262
00:11:21,383 --> 00:11:23,519
which are based on
a limited number of variables

263
00:11:23,719 --> 00:11:25,414
are often highly correlated.

264
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,958
It is the skills of the analyst

265
00:11:28,158 --> 00:11:29,688
which will enable to select

266
00:11:29,888 --> 00:11:31,131
the most relevant index.

267
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:34,125
In image mode,

268
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:36,393
the proposed procedures and indices

269
00:11:36,593 --> 00:11:37,933
are substantially the same.

270
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,770
The zonal object becomes a zonal region.

271
00:11:41,603 --> 00:11:43,650
At the entity or patch level,

272
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:45,512
the minimum distance index

273
00:11:45,712 --> 00:11:47,087
is defined in the same way

274
00:11:47,287 --> 00:11:49,697
as for punctual and linear objects.

275
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,467
In image mode,

276
00:11:51,667 --> 00:11:53,138
the color of each pixel

277
00:11:53,338 --> 00:11:55,614
expresses the distance 
to the nearest pixel

278
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:57,868
belonging to a surface entity.

279
00:12:00,004 --> 00:12:02,572
Areas of closer proximity to entities

280
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:04,918
are also constructed in the same way

281
00:12:05,118 --> 00:12:06,395
as for linear objects.

282
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:10,639
At the level of classes categories,

283
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:13,829
there are many geometric
indices of structure

284
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:16,440
which combine the area and
the perimeter of the objects,

285
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,318
as well as the number of these.

286
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:20,986
Among the simple indicators,

287
00:12:21,186 --> 00:12:22,454
let's retain here an index

288
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:24,626
of mean patch size of the same class,

289
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:26,348
called MPS,

290
00:12:27,016 --> 00:12:29,285
which is equal to the area of ​​class Ac,

291
00:12:29,485 --> 00:12:32,004
divided by the number
of objects of the same class.

292
00:12:33,368 --> 00:12:35,356
Another indicator of simple class

293
00:12:35,556 --> 00:12:38,237
is the ED edge density index,

294
00:12:38,437 --> 00:12:39,351
which is equal to the ratio

295
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:43,045
between the sum of the perimeters of
the objects belonging to a class I,

296
00:12:43,245 --> 00:12:46,869
and the sum of the areas of objects
belonging to the same class.

297
00:12:49,177 --> 00:12:51,370
There are also more complex indices,

298
00:12:52,127 --> 00:12:53,625
like the mean fractal index,

299
00:12:53,825 --> 00:12:54,591
which is constructed

300
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,467
on the basis of the fractal dimension
of each patch.

301
00:12:58,589 --> 00:13:00,229
The fractal dimension D

302
00:13:00,429 --> 00:13:02,566
is a size that translates the way

303
00:13:02,766 --> 00:13:04,984
an irregularly shaped surface 

304
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:06,427
fills the space.

305
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:10,315
The formula for the mean
fractal index presented here

306
00:13:10,515 --> 00:13:12,291
is based on a definition

307
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,835
which is based on
the dimension of homothety

308
00:13:15,035 --> 00:13:16,217
in fractal geometry.

309
00:13:16,824 --> 00:13:19,091
We now turn to the structural indices

310
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:20,392
of surface objects

311
00:13:20,592 --> 00:13:22,281
considered at the landscape level.

312
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:25,705
It is possible at this level

313
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:28,049
to produce indices of thematic structures

314
00:13:28,249 --> 00:13:30,382
which account for the central tendency,

315
00:13:30,582 --> 00:13:33,417
that is to say from the variability
of the thematic properties

316
00:13:33,617 --> 00:13:35,403
in all the studied region.

317
00:13:35,992 --> 00:13:36,943
To start

318
00:13:37,143 --> 00:13:39,317
the majority index MOD

319
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:41,343
provides the value or category

320
00:13:41,543 --> 00:13:43,370
whose area is the majority.

321
00:13:45,256 --> 00:13:48,207
The Shannon Diversity Index or entropy,

322
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:49,881
is mainly based

323
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:52,906
on the proportion of the area
of ​​the study area

324
00:13:53,106 --> 00:13:55,041
which is occupied by the category I.

325
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:57,743
The SHDI is equal to 0

326
00:13:57,943 --> 00:14:00,514
when the study area is composed
of a single category

327
00:14:00,714 --> 00:14:01,901
and is homogeneous.

328
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:05,938
Its value increases according
to the number of categories,

329
00:14:06,138 --> 00:14:08,154
as well as the trend towards uniformity

330
00:14:08,354 --> 00:14:09,825
of the areas of each category.

331
00:14:11,428 --> 00:14:12,958
The Claude Shannon's entropy

332
00:14:13,158 --> 00:14:14,859
is originally a mathematical function

333
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:16,823
which corresponds to 
the amount of information

334
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:18,698
contained or delivered

335
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:20,392
by a source of information.

336
00:14:20,997 --> 00:14:22,122
And to conclude,

337
00:14:22,322 --> 00:14:24,157
Shannon's regularity index 

338
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:26,163
is also based on the proportion

339
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:28,359
of the area of ​​the study area

340
00:14:28,559 --> 00:14:30,055
occupied by category I,

341
00:14:30,677 --> 00:14:31,952
but we consider this time

342
00:14:32,152 --> 00:14:34,143
the ratio between this proportion

343
00:14:34,343 --> 00:14:37,737
and the natural logarithm
of the number of distinct classes

344
00:14:37,937 --> 00:14:39,627
which are present in the study region.

345
00:14:40,215 --> 00:14:43,369
The value of the regularity index SHEI

346
00:14:43,569 --> 00:14:44,416
approaches 0

347
00:14:44,616 --> 00:14:46,932
when the areas of each category type

348
00:14:47,132 --> 00:14:48,205
are very different.

349
00:14:48,405 --> 00:14:49,674
And the index is equal to 1

350
00:14:49,874 --> 00:14:51,890
when the areas of each of the types

351
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:53,266
are perfectly equal,

352
00:14:53,466 --> 00:14:54,637
translated by

353
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:56,755
a regularity in the landscape.

354
00:15:06,907 --> 00:15:08,366
There are many indices

355
00:15:08,566 --> 00:15:11,170
describing the arrangement
of geographical objects,

356
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,295
as well as their neighborhood relations

357
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,488
which transcribe a level
of organization on the territory.

358
00:15:17,269 --> 00:15:19,808
The punctual, linear or surface objects

359
00:15:20,021 --> 00:15:21,642
which constitute the numerical models

360
00:15:21,842 --> 00:15:22,888
of the analyzed landscapes,

361
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:25,612
are rarely independent of
the objects that surround them.

362
00:15:26,852 --> 00:15:29,061
Indeed, for historical reasons

363
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:31,626
or because of the influence of proximity,

364
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:33,968
these different types of spatial units

365
00:15:34,168 --> 00:15:35,889
can show common properties,

366
00:15:36,089 --> 00:15:38,060
they are likely to form groups

367
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,974
with distinct characteristics

368
00:15:40,174 --> 00:15:43,091
which can be described
by specific indicators.

369
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:44,839
It is in ecology

370
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:47,139
that we more commonly use 
this type of index,

371
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,949
to quantify the regularity or diversity

372
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:53,085
of phenomena that
are distributed in the landscape.
