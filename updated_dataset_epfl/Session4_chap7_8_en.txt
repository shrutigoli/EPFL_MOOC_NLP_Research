Space is indeed what brings us together and what separates us.
There is space between us, the space we share.
The duality of space is also a major social issue, that reflects the tension between the distance necessary for the expression of individuality and the contact necessary for the expression of society.
Because action takes place, space is inevitably a problem of desires, appropriation, inequalities, identities and conflicts.
Living together with space means finding a way to share that works..
Clearly, the Internet is a space wherein sharing will become increasingly complicated as the number of players increases.
Internet also has the particularity of being simultaneously global, national and regional.
Yet, tradeoffs must be made together, in order to organize this space and guide its future.
Tradeoffs like privacy vs. transparency, security vs. freedom of expression, and intellectual property vs. the dissemination of knowledge can be left neither to the market nor to the power of individual disappointments.
These adjustments raise many difficulties because it can legitimately be argued that the space for their regulation is unquestionably the World.
On the other hand, these tradeoffs have an inevitable cost: policy.
Losing individual sovereignty to gain power to make the plurality of the World exist together seems like the only condition of this coexistence, in a unified world of interconnections.
Thus, â€œthe Eldoradoâ€� has probably lasted too long.
Google prioritizes spaces using opaque algorithms of which it alone is the master, giving it unrivalled centrality.
Facebook handles the social practices of more than a billion people whose relationships and exchanges become its property.
The network effect of such players is so great that it is becoming increasingly difficult to escape it, or risk losing the gains of that which was nonetheless produced collectively
(hypertext links, publications, relationships, etc.).
Thatâ€™s why it is worth asking why such key features were not developed using principles comparable to packet transmission, IP addressing, messaging or the Web at the Internetâ€™s founding.
How is it that a private company can monopolize our social networks and stockpile our digital traces, and sell them unbeknownst to us?
Why is it so unthinkable that social networks are becoming a protocol like any other, whose market activity will eventually come down to simplifying use, like messaging or the Web?
Why do private companies give themselves permission to activate cameras remotely on stolen computers?
Why does Google think it can divert the privacy settings of a competing browser?
Why did Megaupload prosper for so long with total impunity?
The answer: simply because politics were largely absent from this space for many years, and often restricted its involvement to limited authoritative prerogatives.
Above all, this authority was largely inapplicable in a space where the State had so little control.
Yet, defining what is fair and the means for complying with this is a highly political issue that is little satisfied with injunctions at inappropriate scales.
Justice is invariably a compromise between private interests that incorporate provisional values and is therefore contextual.
Which is why the World and the Internet share a common problem: justice can be thought about at this scale but is only marginally effective.
The Internet as such is facing a formidable problem: making local conceptions of what is fair commensurable while changing the practical arrangements of living together by its very existence.
It is not Wikipedia, P2P (Peer-to-Peer), blogs or collective evaluation platforms that should be questioned, but rather what they will become in a highly commercial world driven by numerous private interests, from which the Internet will not escape unscathed without full consideration of what sharing includes.
Now more than ever we must explore this question and together devise the means for maintaining this shared space, and of sharing it.
Paradoxically, the Internet is an ideal place for implementing such a project, by dint of the conversations that take place in a broader public sphere.
But sharing cannot be done without considering the plurality of individuals, spaces and institutions concerned by it.
Certainly we must safeguard against idiocy, which the ancient Greeks defined as the propensity to restrict oneâ€™s horizons and isolate oneself from a broader world.
The Internet thus appears to be the ideal space for the emergence of a World society, a society whose ultimate horizon is political.
This dynamic underscores the weakness of nation states, which were once legitimate before being overwhelmed by increasingly intense practices at scales that largely exceed them.
In this respect, individualsâ€™ disengagement from and mistrust of politics is not so much a failure of politics as of the nation state, which clearly no longer has the means to fulfill its ambitions.
Currently, numerous are the events that take the World as their pertinent space for expression and political action.
But the Internet is facing an obstacle that threatens all of its underpinnings.
Paradoxically, the time seems to have come where politics must preserve the utopia it had aspired to do without.
The Internet was in fact conceived and designed with the libertarian ideal of self-organization, which left plenty of room for the individual.
Also, this system has demonstrated the effective power of this ideology, which has already profoundly changed the World.
However, by becoming a reality, this utopia has taken place.
Now that itâ€™s a place, the Internet is faced with humanity at its most political: the reconciliation of individual interests in a shared space.
Politics could certainly jeopardize the Internetâ€™s potential, but it also seems like the most obvious way to preserve it.
Nation-States were slow to perceive what was emerging, but now that their sovereignty has been further weakened and compromised
- overwhelmed on all sides - they are attempting to regain control of their space.
This jolt takes unequal forms, ranging from the widespread surveillance techniques used by the United States to nationalization in China (and Iran even more so) to the Domain Name System blockades imposed on Internet Service Providers in France and the U.K.
The premises of the Internetâ€™s future governance are a far cry from those initiated at its emergence, of which TCP-IP (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol), messaging and the Web are the heirs.
Though co-authors of this announced catastrophe, individuals are now witnessing the commercial hyper-concentration of this space in the hands of a few companies and its uncoordinated, misinformed, authoritarian regulation by States legitimately seeking their place in this space that exceeds their means.
Make no mistake about it.
The legacy of the Internetâ€™s founders is not steadfast.
Changes in protocols, including IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6), will simplify national regulations and the undermining of the networkâ€™s â€œneutralityâ€�, allowing for unprecedented control of digital practices.
A Stateless space, the Internet was created with the illusion that politics were incapable of taking control of it.
Pushed to the limits of their intimacy â€“ space â€“
States are now calling to restore their respective orders.
But because these orders are highly diverse and in large part contradictory, the Internet will undergo profound changes in the decades to come.
More than ever people need to be aware of this fragile balance.
States will intervene as best they can in response to the increasing excesses of a space whose unequal control calls for inevitable regulations to protect fundamental freedoms, while unable to coordinate their actions at the Internet scale (i.e. the World).
Now more than ever, it is not a question of morals but of ethics, because what we do to the Internet we do to the World at large.
That is why the future must choose between the globalization of politics and the nationalization of the Internet.
The first option would merely be the continuation of a long process begun in the early coalescences of humanity.
The second would be a terrible decline that would mean not only the end of the Internet as we know it, but also that of a global, emerging society that is only asking to express itself.
A powerful vehicle of the globalization that actively mobilizes individuals, the Internet does suggest that the time has come for humanity to think about this upscaling towards its ultimate horizon: the World.
Because the Internet is the ideal public sphere for meeting this challenge, an ideal but fragile place that we must never cease to consider, build, share, feed and preserve, together.
