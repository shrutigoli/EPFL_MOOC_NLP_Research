An archive is like a living organism:
if you want to understand fully\Nits current structure
you need to understand its history\Nbecause an archive changes over time.
It moves, it gets restructured,\Nit gets old.
Another way of seeing an archive\Nis seeing it as a volume of volumes
because what does the archive really\Nis organizing spaces.
You have a big space\Ncut into smaller spaces
which then lead to the conservation,\Nthe indexation of smaller special units :
Box, registers, statue, painting.
Let's go and have a concrete example.
You see here the corridors\Nof the state archives in Venice.
80 kilometers of documents,\Ndocumenting a thousand years of history.
Venice is a special case because of\Nits political origin,
it maintained an archival system\Nover very very long periods.
And this is that archival system\Ncomposed of very long document series
that we can now use to think about\Nthe possibility of recreating the density
of the past.
You have documents, registers\Nbut you have also maps for instance.
Not one map, but thousands of maps.
And these maps give a very detailed account\Nabout the structure and spatial organization
of Venice.\NBut also of many other places.
Let's go a bit deeper in the different typologies\Nof documents we may encounter.
Administrative documents, testaments,\Ncontracts.
All the documents that permit to have\Nthe organization of a city.
It there are some work to be done,\Nif there are some transformation in the city
there are new laws that are voted.\NAll this is documented in the archives.
They used to be at different places in Venice
and it's only at the beginning\Nof the 19th century
that they got in a single,\Nvery big space.
An ancient covent which is\Nthe state archive of Venice today.
Very huge building, 300 rooms,\N80 kilometers of shelves
and the question : how can we transform\Nthat physical space
in an information system.
Are we capable of searching\Nin so many documents.
What type of technology can we use\Nto make it accessible.
3 steps are key to this transformation.
The first step is the digitization :\Nwe need first to transform
theses physical documents into images,\Nmillions of images.
Second step : transcription, indexation,\Nsegmentation and analysing the documents
so that they are searchable very easily.
And last step : connecting the information\Nwhich are in the document in a big graph
linking people and places.
Typical use case for us would be\Na search engine
I would like to be capable\Nof typing the name of a Venitian
for instance Battista Nani\Nand find all the documents
that are related with that person.
It seems an easy thing to do\Nand we do it every day
for the data about the present,\Nit's quite difficult to do
for the data about the past.
And this is the core subject\Nof this course.
