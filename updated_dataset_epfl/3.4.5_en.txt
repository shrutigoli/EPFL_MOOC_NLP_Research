This video is about rendezvous sensors and rendezvous control, for the Space Shuttle specifically what the crew had available, in order, on one hand, to do updating of the relative state vector of a chaser versus target using sensor data, and on the other hand for the control, the controls that were available for commanding rotation and translation to perform manually the end portion of the rendezvous until the grapple point for Hubble, or the docking point for the International Space Station.
Now, as far as the rendezvous sensors are concerned, we had Star Trackers located in the forward fuselage, one of them looking straight up.
This is a so-called <i>- Z Star Tracker,</i> looking straight up, perpendicular to the plane of the wings, but in the opposite direction from the belly of the spacecraft, and this one was a so-called <i>- Y Star Tracker,</i> looking to the port side.
Now, again, looking at the target using any of these sensors was giving us azimuth and elevation, and through Kalman filtering, this could be introduced into the relative state vector for more accuracy and for keeping the error of the relative state vector as small as possible.
Obviously, we had a rendezvous radar for the final portion of the rendezvous.
This was giving us not only azimuth and elevation - this was, of course, the orientation of the antenna, which was pointed to the target - but also range and range rates.
Another one that we had available was a so-called <i>COAS,</i>
Crew Optical Alignment Sight.
It was basically like a gun sight, that was available to the crew looking exactly in the <i>- Z</i> direction pretty much like the <i>- Z</i> Star Tracker.
And the crew could use this in order to see the position of the target versus the <i>- Z</i> body vector of the Space Shuttle.
Now, rendezvous burn execution: we have to do all these <i>Î”Vs</i> during the whole rendezvous profile, and either we have a small <i>Î”V</i> or a large <i>Î”V</i> to perform, and the Shuttle was equipped with different kinds of thrusters.
The most powerful thrusters were the so-called <i>OMS Thrusters</i>,
Orbital Maneuvering System.
If we had a <i>Î”V</i> of, typically, a few feet per second, then we would use the OMS Thrusters, located in the the arm fuselage, in the aft fuselage, and giving us a relatively large <i>Î”V</i> for each maneuver.
If we had to do a small <i>Î”V</i>, we would use a so-called <i>+ X RCS</i>,
RCS for Reaction Control System.
There were 38 total small thrusters, in the nose and in the aft portion of the fuselage of the Shuttle, and if we were using the <i>+ X</i>, so we're firing only the ones that were in the back in order to give us small <i>Î”Vs</i>, typically a fraction of a foot per second, or maybe one or two feet per second.
There was also the possibility of not orienting the Shuttle so that the <i>Î”V</i> was going to be in the <i>X</i> direction of the Space Shuttle itself, but we could do a <i>Multiaxis RCS</i> to give us, in a certain direction, versus the body of the Space Shuttle, a given <i>Î”V</i>, using several reaction control system motors.
Now, in the final portion of the rendezvous, the crew, typically the Commander and Pilot, and here we have John Young on the left-hand side, the Commander of STS-1, the first Space Shuttle flight, which was on the 12th of April, 1981, and we have Bob Crippen, who was the pilot of the same mission.
And here they are still in their space suits, located in the so-called <i>aft flight deck</i> of the Space Shuttle.
And from the aft flight deck it was possible to control the Space Shuttle movement.
We had the so-called
<i>rotation hand controller,</i> pretty much like a stick that we could command
3 degrees of freedom rotation with it.
We had, on one hand, the so-called <i>pitch</i>, here, and we had also the <i>roll</i> and the <i>yaw</i>, which could be commanded with the RHC.
And we had also the <i>translation hand controller</i>, a small controller, pretty much like a mushroom, and we could either push it and pull it, and it would make this kind of motion, and we could either decide, by means of the switch on the aft panel, that this motion of the translation hand controller was going to be commanding <i>- Z</i>, respectively, <i>+ Z</i> direction, or it could be a so-called <i>- X</i> or <i>+ X</i>, and whether this translation hand control was commanding <i>Z</i> or <i>X</i>, respectively, <i>- Z</i> or <i>- X</i> was determined by the position of that switch.
And it was the same, also, for the rotation hand controller; that switch, <i>- Z</i> or <i>- X</i>, was applicable to both the rotation and translation hand controller.
We'll look now at the translation hand controller inputs and consequences.
Let's suppose that we are here, looking with the Space Shuttle, using the Crew Optical Alignment Sight, which is basically a sight available to the crew to look into the <i>- Z</i> body axis, and we look at the payload, which is here, and we see that the payload is moving toward the nose of the orbit, and we want to stabilize it with respect to the Shuttle orbiter.
So we have the translation hand controller, that controller which looks like a mushroom, and it has been set in the <i>+ X, - X</i> mode, and we take it upwards, so it's very logical, very intuitive, and this will fire thrusters in the back of the orbiter, and it will make the orbiter move towards its nose until, visible from the Crew
Optical Alignment Sight, payload, which is here, is stabilized with respect to the Crew
Optical Alignment Sight.
So this is the way we operate the translation hand controller.
Rotation hand control is something similar.
We have the RHC here, and we give, in this illustration, a roll to the left, or a negative roll, and this will fire thrusters in one direction, in the forward reaction control system thrusters, and in the other direction with the aft reaction control system thrusters.
This will be the consequence on the payload.
The Shuttle is here, rolling negatively, which will create a positive roll of the target versus the Space Shuttle.
That's the use of the rotational hand controller from the aft flight deck, as we depicted before.
This is a depiction of the final approach to the target.
The target, as usual, is represented as the intersection of the two axes, again, the vertical axis to the center of the Earth, and the horizontal axis, with the velocity vector to the left.
And, as indicated before, we come, on a typical Shuttle rendezvous, with either the International Space Station or the Hubble Space Telescope, from behind and below, and we have a certain number of so-called <i>mid-course corrections</i>: there was mid-course 1, 2, 3, and there's another one here, and it's just an adjustment of the trajectory-- relative trajectory - of the Shuttle versus the target in order to come with a proper velocity, on one hand, or the proper trajectory.
We have to do braking; if we do braking then we have a reaction control system in the forward and the aft firing at the proper direction in order to reduce the range rates.
We'll always want to adjust the range rate so as to be, as the value depicted here, a little more than one thousandth of the range in feet, in feet per second for the range rates.
And we continue the trajectory, this is all done manually at this point.
We use mainly the Crew Optical Alignment Sight to see the position of the target versus the chaser, until we come in a position that was pretty standard for ISS: about 600 feet below ISS.
Normally, what was done: after the Columbia accident there was a hold point
600 feet below the ISS, and then there was a pitch maneuver of the Space Shuttle in order for the crew on board the International Space Station to be able to point cameras toward the Space Shuttle and verify that there was no damage to the thermal protection system, which, as you know, had caused the accident of Columbia, in February, 2003, because it was undetected damage to the thermal protection system during the ascent.
So we wanted to verify, on the last Shuttle missions, from about 2005, until the last one, in 2011, always wanted to verify, prior to docking a Shuttle with the International Space Station, that the thermal protection system was in good shape for the re-entry.
