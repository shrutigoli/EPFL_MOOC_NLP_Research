Most objects which are the matter for geographic reflection are only summarily situated, or in an implicit manner, often leaving the concrete modalities of this location unresolved.
As for cartography, it gives itself the right to decide upon a location, or more precisely a mode of location within the Euclidean space of the map.
More plainly, on the map.
Space once again becomes a base, a limiting idea for geography, and which it has taken much time to undo.
Thus, the places of cartographic space must have coordinates.
Not only must objectsâ€™ positions be decided upon, but also their shapes, more-or-less complex shapes, but planar: polygonal, in a network, simple points, and lines.
A cartographic place is thus always the result of an initial arbitration as to its graphical form, and we have seen that this form could be defined by a type of reference space and its properties.
Thus, there always remains a residual error to location in cartography.
When a city is resumed to a point, a county to its geometric centroid, or to the contrary, that which is less often perceived as an error in location but which remains an important approximation, when a punctual measurement is attributed to a polygonal space.
Within the framework of a cartographic reading, one single rule applies: every piece of information related to a point is supposed to be â€œlocalâ€�, that is to say valid for this point and its immediate neighbourhood, and loses its relevancy the farther away one distances oneself.
As per need, graphical separations such as administrative borders can be used to define this neighbourhood.
However it is often an artifice which complicates the mapâ€™s reading, even to the point of being parasitical.
Moreover, the geographic coordinates of a spatial reality on a terrestrial globe, and the distances separating it from another reality can be very different once the terrestrial surface is flattened by the operation called
<i>projection</i>.
Projection allows a map to be drawn over a planar base, when the geographic reference space is not planar, since it is the surface of a globe.
As you could verify it with the help of the instrument at your disposal, these projections are innumerable.
By transforming coordinates originally given in longitude and latitude, according to meridians and parallels, and into rectangular coordinates, that is to say relative to the edges of a map, the neighbourhood can be recomposed in a very unexpected manner.
These deformations can be a source of creativity.
Used wisely, they can reinforce a geographic idea by a simple image, made of alignments for example.
In reality, cartographic location is an integral part of the work of cartographic conception.
It is not only concerned with the choice of the geometric shapes of places, nor of their projections.
Projections can certainly respect areas, and then it is called an equal-area projection.
It can also respect local shapes, but not over a long distance, and that is called a conformal projection.
However the two are not possible at the same time.
Projections which do not respect anything, called aphylactic projections, can provide very appropriate location bases for the geographic messages of the map.
This is the case for
Buckminster Fullerâ€™s projection, which displays the world as an island, that of a unified human species.
We could go much further into the configuration of cartographic reference.
It is more and more common today to have recourse to anamorphosis.
They allow the map to be deformed in a way to give more visibility to spaces which are the most important to the mapâ€™s theme, the most populated areas for example.
The maps drawn on these kinds of bases are called <i>cartograms</i>.
By increasing or decreasing the size of territorial units in proportion to the population of voting age, anamorphosis â€œaccording to populationâ€� for example allow a weight to be given equivalent to the inhabitants of a county in electoral cartography.
A person equals one vote equals a fixed area on the cartogram.
By default, on a traditional map, the votes in rural places and places lacking density seem to dominate the map.
By generalising the process yet further, we could construct inverted cartograms, which could be called â€œanti-cartogramsâ€�, for example by using an anamorphosis inversely proportional to the population.
The resulting map displays a filamented structure, taking up the great axes of settlement pattern, the opposite of a classical cartogram, which to the contrary juxtaposes bubbles at the spot where cities are, but almost makes intermediate spaces and the inter-urban relationships which they compete to disseminate.
If the two cartograms are associated to a traditional Euclidean map, the latter could be equated to cartogram according to area.
The ensemble forms a triptych in fact enlightening what
I call the three phases of space: the co-presence phase for the cartogram, focusing on urban spatialities ; the circulatory phase for the anti-cartogram, focusing on the spatialities of mobility; and logically the tele-communicational phase for the traditional Euclidean map, since for this kind of map no deformation seeks to reduce the connective spatialities normally being substituted for co-presence or circulation.
Often disregarded by cartographers, very simple maps such as tourist maps or subway maps are however examples of cartographic effectiveness.
Cartographic places are fabricated by the means of a figurative image or a symbol perhaps indicating their distinctive qualities, such as the activities are proposed, their function or the weather.
These maps are not meant to be studied as a whole, to analyse the overall structure of space for example.
However they remain efficient for comparing places one to another, measuring their remotness, or even planning an itinerary.
Provided that sufficient localised information is available, which is often digital, it is however possible to draw maps according to statistical bases.
For example, the size of a figurative image representing a place in relation to its population could be varied.
Many geo-statistical techniques today allow maps with continuous colour nuances to be created, often revealing the deep structures of a territory in a very efficient or even attractive way.
Its demographic dynamic regarding fertility for example.
A branch of quantitative cartography has focused on statistical concepts to develop techniques allowing graphical contrasts within a map to be better controlled in a way as to make them clearer, and to produce sharper maps.
This can be done for example by contrasting two or three place categories based on their characteristics which are however much more varied.
These methods, called
<i>discretisation</i>, answer to two distinct and sometimes contradictory logics.
The first one consists in distinguishing the statistical values characteristic of places according to thresholds which are significant according to the mapâ€™s theme.
Places on the map can thus be ordered into classes defined by these thresholds, for example the threshold would be the majority in an election or zero degrees Celsius for frozen areas.
Another logic consists in calculating the cut-off thresholds based on the statistical data themselves for all places, allowing either a maximal differentiation of space
- the median is thus used -, and making maps on different themes easily comparable, or a location of each place into a scale of existing values
- thus the average and standard deviation are used.
It is certainly a technical approach, requiring specific skills and a sensitivity to biases and the particularities of statistical manipulations.
However once mastered, it can be understood that the real issues in cartography are not about these techniques.
An instrument will allow you to test different discretisations for the cartography of two indicators whose geography is very different.
The treatments which
I have just addressed are widely practiced today with the help of software.
There certainly exists software specific to cartography.
However, until now the trend has rather been for an increasing disassociation between pre-treatment, carried out by what is called
<i>geographic information systems</i>
- GIS, SIG in French - , allowing for the creation of raw cartographic layers, and vectorial drawing software used downstream, carried out by specialised cartographers and graphic artists to end up with editorial-quality maps.
GIS can also suffice for the creation of maps which are relatively less elaborate graphically.
However, cartography practiced beyond a certain level and beyond the exploratory stage cannot do without real work on the image, requiring appropriate instruments, but also and especially specific skills, close to design work and fairlyd istant from computer programming.
For their part, GIS are none other than information systems devoted to spatial information.
They are thus based on a database system, in general made to store elaborate geographic information allowing for a description of complex spaces.
For example spaces with holes or discontinuities, territories with lakes, or networks where the direction of traffic must be recorded could be evoked.
As to its storage capacities,
GIS add calculation modules which are made to treat geographic information.
For example, they allow distances and areas to be calculated, or for polygons to be cut using a network, etc.
The main advantage of GIS for cartography is to unify geographic information into a normal framework at the heart of which can be developed standards facilitating a sharing of information.
Efficient, free, and freely-available GIS are now being developed.
It is only to be expected that cartographic modules of an increasing quality will improve them, allowing cartographic expression to go further with only these instruments, which at the beginning were very much for programmers only.
Let us add that the opening of these software platforms designate them as choice instruments for the research and development of spatial intelligence or in applied geography.
They in fact allow the practical validity of new theoretical concepts to be tested, such as that of scalar spectrum for example.
However, the cartographic process does not stop at the creation of thematic layers such as administrative boundaries, built space, roads, demographic or economic data, layers which could then be superimposed to create a finished and effective map.
I would even say that the real issue of the relationship between cartography and geography consists in the art of this combination.
Cartographic mediology is the ensemble of graphic techniques specific to the objects which are maps, techniques which allow a maximisation of the range of expression for spatial ideas through design.
Starting from a modulated superpositioning of crude spatialised information layers, it means making a patchwork or a juxtaposition of plates.
Each will then correspond to a geographical place and return the imageâ€™s content into the register of geography and its concepts.
