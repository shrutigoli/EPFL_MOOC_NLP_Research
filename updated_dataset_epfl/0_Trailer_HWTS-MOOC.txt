Sandec & EPFL are partnering to bring you a series of online courses or MOOCs.
This MOOC is dedicated to household water treatment and safe storage or HTWS.
So who might be interested in this course?
Maybe you work with communities in a region that doesn't yet have reliable and safe water supply?
Maybe you're involved with emergency response and need short-term solutions for treating water when public supplies are out of commission.
Maybe you work with people who are particularly vulnerable to diarrheal disease, such as people living with HIV/aids.
Or perhaps you are a researcher interested in developing and improving solutions for situations like these.
In this course we will learn about the different pathogens found in drinking water that cause disease.
We will discuss different pathways of exposure to these pathogens and how these pathways can be blocked.
We will also examine the burden of disease caused by unsafe water as well as the related problems of poor sanitation and hygiene.
Household water treatment is practiced by millions, even billions of people around the world.
In this course, you will learn about the different ways that water can be treated at the household level.
We will examine the roles that can be played by non-governmental organizations, businesses and government agencies.
We'll hear from people with expertise on reaching those affected by natural disasters.
And you'll also meet guest speakers from the World Health Organization, the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine and other places specializing in HWTS.
You'll learn more about measuring water quality using portable equipment.
And you'll get to find out what this device is and how it works.
So I hope you'll join us for this short course on household water treatment and how it can be applied around the world.
We look forward to working with you!
