Hello and welcome to chapter 3:
"Numerical integration and quadrature formulas"
Today we will deal with the following problems.
First we will define the problem.
The goal is to numerically approximate the integral of a continuous function f on the interval [a,b].
Say the function f is exp(x^2), there is no explicit primitive for this function. 
We will introduce the quadrature formula, we will talk about quadrature weights, quadrature nodes, we will build the rectangle rule
(or mid-point rule), the trapezoidal rule, which are straight forward rules.
Next Simpson's rule which is a bit more complicated, but more accurate.
And finally, the interesting topic, the Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules.
