I will be talking in this session about ontologies.
So, what are ontologies and why are they useful for neuroscience?
Well, ontology actually comes from two Greek words â€œontoâ€� for existence or being real and â€œlogiaâ€� for science or study.
So, ontology is really the science of what exists or is real.
So, an ontology is actually a formal representation of knowledge about a specific set of entities or concepts.
That is how we use it in Computer science it is much more of a schema, it is a controlled vocabulary.
In fact, ontologies can provide several different useful tools for organizing data and expressing knowledge.
For one, it is providing a controlled vocabulary for referring to a set of specific entities or concepts it also contains the relationships between these entities and it defines specific properties of these entities as well, it can.
And those are important things in how do we structure and express concepts their properties, and their relationships.
That is really what an ontology is for.
So, and ontology for a brain region it is actually quite important that it provides a 3D boundary but linked to a specific name and the relationship to any sub-structures or any parent structure, so the ontology used for the Allen Brain
Institute Atlas started from the Swanson ontology and they really used this to capture, for example the structures within the cortex the sub-structures, and the relationship of, for example, the cortex to the diencephalon.
So, it is using both data structures for describing the 3D boundary but also within the standard space linking these regions to a standard name and then abbreviation.
For the data set used in the Blue Brain project used for the initial
Somatosensory cortex model.
There is a large variety of data from many different aspects including electrophysiological data per-synaptic responses, gene expression morphological data, and you have got to organize that by actually annotating the structure with structured ontologies in order to understand how do you want to build a model of these what are the key entities, what are their relationships and what are their properties that youâ€™re modeling.
So, we had to develop ontologies for neuron morphologies and we identified fifty-five morphological types.
Here, this picture shows the different types of neurons on the left, you see the interneurons the inhibitory interneurons, and on the right are the excitatory parameter cells and stellate cells, and each one has a name.
Currently you see, at the top of the column the abbreviations, but for example you have got a layer one neurogliaform cell so in layer one the NGC cell is listed the layer five
Martinotti cell.
Layer five thick tough parameter cell type one and these names are used to characterize the specific properties of neuron morphologies and that is useful for organizing and being consistent with how you refer to different types of neurons within this particular brain region.
The Blue Brain Ontologies for Electrical Types actually is based on the Berthier classification and that means defining how does the cell fire initially so the initial firing type, there is a burst a continuous, or a delay and you can see this in the example traces where maybe initially there is a short high frequency burst and other cells start off immediately firing without a burst or there is maybe a delay in starting the firing response from the current injection.
Similarly, for the sustained firing tether a different type some cells adapt whether their inter-spike interval decreases some are non-adapting where their inter-spike interval remains constant some are fast spiking, so they have deeper after hyper-polarization and they fire in higher frequencies and some are irregular spiking where their inter-spike interval may be quite variable.
And so out of those for the cells in the somatosensory cortex haindling region we have identified eleven electrical types and those are the combinations of initial firing type and sustained firing type.
That forms the ontology for electrical types in Blue Brain.
And here is a table from the 2015. cell paper authored by Markam et. al. which relates this inter-neuron classes to other cell properties and cell types described in the literature, and for example there are many different ways to talk about a cell type many different dimensions along which you can characterize
Those include, for example proteins that are expressed in the cell so molecular markers, electrical types as we have seen from the electrical properties the morphological properties, the morphological shapes but there are many others, including the projections target where do these cells target within the brain or which types of cells do they receive from.
There are many possible ways, but we choose specifically to characterize cells based on their morphology and electro-physiology.
Now that does have a relationship to specific molecular markers and that is very useful for interfacing with very described properties and also, we use gene expression information to identify which types of ion channels are present within a particular cell type.
And so the morpho-electric cell type ontology actually combines which of the morphology types the M types, combine with the electrical type so this is really combining those two ontologies that we talked about earlier, to create a new one where there are 207 morpho-electric types of cells.
And we have data on how many of those occur how many of each of those possibilities happen.
Now all combinations of all morphologies and all electrical types do not occur.
So it is just the common subset, which is 207.
The connections between these cells are actually defined by different types of synapses and there are specific properties that govern these synapses and we have got inhibitory synapses and excitatory and these are ignite by different neuro transmitters.
They also occur with specific kinetics which are facilitating, depressing, or pseudo-linear between specific types of pre-synaptic cells and post-synaptic cell, and those pre-synaptic types are morpho-electric types.
So, we have got a map of synapse types defined according
So, we have got a map of synapse types defined according to pre-synaptic morpho-electric class of cell and the post-synaptic morpho-electric class and then identified by the specific kinetics of that synapse, either facilitating depressing, pseudo-linear inhibitory, or excitatory and those are very key to the definition of this synapse ontology.
Finally, in defining the micro circuits there is a number of specific properties that we have defined to describe a somatosensory cortex micro-circuit and we see that in general these same properties can be used to describe micro-circuits throughout the brain.
First of all, you have got to have a volume boundary
You need to know the minimal boundary sufficient to create a complete micro-circuit, and in this case we used the saturation of the dendritic density to define that.
You have got to know the cell types that I have described earlier in terms of morphological types and the electro-physiological types and their combinations to make morpho-electric types, the total cell count and then the distribution, where of the ME types where of these
Morpho-electric cells
Morpho-electric types of cells.
Where are they distributed, in which density in which distribution throughout that volume?
And then the synapse type maps so youâ€™re combining a number of ontologies into the definition of the micro-circuit.
And then, finally, a type specific bouton density is actually critical to making a functional conversion to the number of synapse to the actually number of synapses.
So, in this session you have learned about what is an ontology how are ontologies used in the data driven modeling and some examples of ontologies in the Blue Brain project.
