Here we are at the third and final module where we will see Archimedes principle and an application example of the calculation of forces that will be the calculation of pressure forces exerted by a volume of water on a straight wall, this is the typical case of a dam. We will start by Archimedes principle, everyone knows Archimedes and his famous
"Eureka" in his bath. Archimedes was a scientist, undoubtedly one of the most important scientist of the Antiquity who lived during the 3rd century BC in the city of Syracuse in
Sicily. From his numerous discoveries, we owe to Archimedes the first result concerning fluid mechanics. This principle of Archimedes is used to calculate the pressure forces exerted on an immersed volume, this principle is stated as following: "All bodies immersed in a fluid at rest is buoyed up by the fluid
by a vertical thrust, opposed to the gravity force,  equal to the weight of the volume of fluid displaced by the object and acting at the center of mass of this fluid." Let's look a little more concretely what does this statement mean, let's take the example of a boat of which we would have here the hull sinking in a certain volume of water, the water surrounding the hull will thus exert pressure forces on the hull of the ship. What interests us is to calculate the total force of pressure exerted by the water on the hull. If I apply
Archimedes principle that we will prove right after, this principle states that the total force is equal to the weight of the volume of water displaced, thus the weight here that corresponds to the initial volume of water, thus at the intersection between the boat and the water and that the second point is the application point of the force is equal to the center of gravity of this volume.
This center is called "center of buoyancy" when speaking of a boat. Archimedes principle is extremely useful because unlike
Pascal's law which is only used to calculate first of all the pressure distribution, then by integration of the total force of pressure. Archimedes principle can directly lead to the result, it seems to be a principle much more interesting, that being said, for it to be applied, the conditions that are stated in the principle must be applicable. Archimedes principle can be proven in a relatively simple way from the equation of Pascal written in tensor form, we have seen previously that the gradient of pressure had to balance the specific weight,
I integrate here over a control volume.
If I use a theorem of tensor analysis called Green-Ostrogradski, when we have here a volume integral where the integral is a gradient, I can transform this integral, here, in a surface integral and the gradient here is transformed in pn.
If I interpret the following result, here,
I thus have the resultant of the pressure forces, here, I have the specific weight of the volume occupied by my control volume, i.e. the displaced specific weight. We here have a proof very fast, very brief of Archimedes principle. Now, let's try to get a pragmatic method to compute the pressure forces. For that, I will firstly use the definition of a pressure force, we have seen that the infinitesimal force of pressure could be written as the pressure multiplied by the infinitesimal surface area, that, as it was a force, we needed a vector which orientates the force, we have a sign - by sign convention, this is the infinitesimal force. The total force
F will be obtained by integrating over the surface area.
To do a calculation of total force, we can apply a relatively simple method that can be listed here in 5 points. Firstly, because the pressure intervenes, we must calculate the pressure, we will see that as we are in hydrostatics, most of the time the pressure will be linear, we will speak of hydrostatic pressure.
Then, to calculate the infinitesimal surface are or to define it, we must beware to define surface areas for which the pressure is homogeneous over this small surface element. Once we have defined the dS, we will be able by integration to calculate the total force, we will also take care of defining the normal of the surface element, in the easiest cases, the normal will be a constant, this is what we will see in the next exercise, if we have objects relatively complex, the normal may vary as a function of the position, we will then have something more complicated to calculate. Then, by integration, we obtain the total force of pressure. We will see in a practical example how to proceed. For that, we will consider a non-permeable floor, a wall of height h, here filled with water over a height h.
I assume that in the direction here which normal to the transparency, I have a width that is equal to l. What interests me here, is to calculate the total force exerted by the volume of water on the wall as well as the moment of these forces. I proceed in the same way I said previously, first of all, by calculating the pressure distribution. For that, I use Pascal's law, we have seen that it was the gradient or the derivative of the pressure with respect to the height z that is equal to the specific weight of the fluid. As the fluid here is incompressible,
Ï� will be constant. We can integrate very simply this linear equation of the first order, we obtain here a linear distribution, to simply the calculation, I will assume here that the atmospheric pressure -z = h is equal to 0, it is just to simply the calculation, it does change anything in my final result. The second point is to define the infinitesimal surface are and for that I had to choose a surface area for which the pressure is homogeneous. If I place myself at a height z and that I take a small element dz and that I take a strip that will be defined as dz multiplied by the width of the channel, on this horizontal strip the pressure will be homogeneous and equal to Ï�g(h-z),
I define dS as l multiplied by dz, the height of the small strip. As previously,
I need a normal vector to this surface area n which is equal here to (1,0), always oreintated from the inside towards the outside, the outside being there where the fluid is. The pressure force will thus be defined as the integral of the infinitesimal force of pressure, in this relatively simple case where n is constant I will be able to take it out and the surface element, we will have ldz, so I can take out here the l from the integral and so I just have to integrate Ï�g(h-z)dz,
Ï�g is also taken out from the integral so when
I integrate this, I obtain the result that the pressure force depends on the height at the power 2, multiplied by the specific weight Ï�g, multiplied by the width and divided by 2. This force is orientated by the normal vector n. Let's now compute the moment of forces with respect to a point and I will take here as a point the point O here which is at the angle. By definition, the elementary moment, the infinitesimal moment, it will be the distance, here r, multiplied by the elementary force here, as we have something that will be orthogonal, it will be relatively simple to do the cross product, so the distance r which here is in fact equal to z therefore the cross product that is here written relatively simple
Ï�g(h-z)dz. When I integrate this result,
I get that the force moment of pressure in O is equal to the specific weight Ï�g, multiplied by the width of the channel, multiplied by the height of water to the power 3, divided by
6, and so this vector is carried by the vector ey which is normal to the transparency. If now
I sum up these two results, I have shown that my pressure distribution was linear, we speak of hydrostatic distribution of pressure and that as I have the moment of force in O that is equal to the force multiplied by a lever arm equal to h/3, meaning that the application point of the force is situated at 1/3 of the height so it is situated here. To conclude our chapter 4 on hydrostatics, we will give the solutions of the small quiz.
The first question was relatively simple, we had to calculate the pressure force exerted by water at a depth z on coins that could be orientated differently according to the horizontal, according to the vertical or at 45Â°, what we have shown during this chapter is that the pressure, if we are working with an incompressible flow, depends only on the depth and does not depend on the orientation of the facet. The pressure, for these 3 facets of different orientation is strictly identical, the good answer is in fact the
3 answers at the same time: a, b and c. The second question of the quiz is a little more difficult,
I asked to calculate in which case the the traction force that had to be applied on a brick to put it into motion was maximum, we had 2 possible configurations either the brick was immersed in water, or it was in open air. This brick was set on a substrate assumed impermeable and horizontal. To answer this question, we have to do a little bit of mechanics and recall the notion of the law of friction in a liquid medium. The friction force in a liquid is proportional to what we call the apparent weight, i.e. the specific weight - the pressure force.
We must be extremely cautious. Let's take the case where we have a body, here it will be a particle for example spherical which is entirely immersed therefore it means that it is entirely surrounded by water thus water exerts pressure forces all over and so I will have a resultant of pressure forces that will tend to make the particle go up, there is also an exerting force that is the specific weight of the particle that is exerting in this direction here, depending on whether the density of the fluid is greater or not to the one of the solid, we will have a solid that goes back up or else that sinks. Let's examine now the case where we have two particles which are immersed so that are surrounded by a fluid, the pressure forces will be applied all over these fluids except perhaps at the contact point, these two particles are in contact, I will assume that they are moving so there will be a friction force, in this case here, the friction force, following the Coulomb law will be proportional to the apparent weight so to this difference between the weight of the particle and the pressure force. Let's now consider a case which is the case of the brick that seems identical but which is in fact not at all.
Indeed, let's look how the fluid behaves against this brick. We see here that the fluid surrounding the spherical particle and so the forces are being exerted all over and therefore we have a resultant that is upwards, we see here that there is no water so we have pressure forces here on the vertical sides that will counterbalance and we have here a pressure that is a force that is applied only from the top towards the bottom so the resultant of pressure forces will be a pressure force orientated in this case here from the top to the bottom and that will be added to the specific weight of the disk, in this case here, unlike what is happening for a body that is completely immersed, as we here have a contact surface that is not water, we will have an apparent weight that will be the specific weight and it is here where there is a subtlety, that will be + the pressure force. The force needed to put into motion this brick will be proportional to the specific weight of the brick, but, as we are pressing it with a column of water that is here, we must add the pressure force resultant. The traction force needed to put into motion this brick will greater in water than in air. We have thus finished with this chapter number 4 dedicated to hydrostatics, we have seen an extremely important result which that the law of hydrostatics, we will see that this law of hydrostatics will be in some ways the embryo, will be the cornerstone on which we will build the dynamics of fluids.
We have also seen a principle extremely important which is Archimedes principle but we have seen through the second question of the quiz that this principle is much more subtle to use than it seems at first.
