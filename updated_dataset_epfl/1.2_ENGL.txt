00:00:03,947 --> 00:00:06,396
This chapter presents 
the three Kepler's laws

2
00:00:06,396 --> 00:00:09,507
describing the motion
of objects in the solar system

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:12,671
and by extension in every planetary
and stellar system.

4
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:16,870
They related in a simple way the masses 
of the interacting bodies

5
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:18,836
to the shape of their orbit

6
00:00:18,836 --> 00:00:22,113
and to the typical travel times
on these orbits,

7
00:00:22,113 --> 00:00:24,288
namely the orbital periods.

8
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:27,651
Kepler's laws are the result of
the work of a great observer

9
00:00:27,651 --> 00:00:29,823
and mathematician.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:33,185
They were deducted from the observations
of danish Tycho Brahe,

11
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:35,816
an astronomer with quite
a sturdy character,

12
00:00:35,816 --> 00:00:38,836
strong advocate of the geocentric
view of the Universe

13
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:43,215
Tycho Brahe worked from
the island of Ven

14
00:00:43,215 --> 00:00:44,470
in front of Copenhagen,

15
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,370
that king Frederick II bequeathed to him

16
00:00:47,372 --> 00:00:49,134
to create an observatory :

17
00:00:49,134 --> 00:00:52,618
Uraniborg, dedicated to
the Muse of Astronomy.

18
00:00:52,618 --> 00:00:56,174
He was the last astronomer
before the era of telescopes.

19
00:00:56,174 --> 00:01:00,154
He mapped the sky with an
extreme precision for the time

20
00:01:00,154 --> 00:01:02,758
using sextants and astrolabes.

21
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:06,257
He even took into account the
atmospheric refraction,

22
00:01:06,257 --> 00:01:09,802
an apparent displacement of
stars on the sky

23
00:01:09,802 --> 00:01:12,275
due to the refraction
of light rays

24
00:01:12,275 --> 00:01:14,533
by the the Earth's atmosphere. 

25
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:18,115
In 1600, Kepler became
Tycho Brahe's assistant

26
00:01:18,115 --> 00:01:21,025
who asked him to
compute Mars' orbit.

27
00:01:21,025 --> 00:01:23,175
As opposed to Brahe,

28
00:01:23,175 --> 00:01:26,674
Kepler supported the model of
a heliocentric universe

29
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:29,209
which was a source of 
disagreement between them

30
00:01:29,209 --> 00:01:32,060
and slowed down the work of Kepler.

31
00:01:32,064 --> 00:01:36,100
His work took him six years and
was published in 1609.

32
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,711
Later, Newton theories built
a framework around Kepler's law

33
00:01:41,711 --> 00:01:45,001
which were until then only a
purely mathematical description

34
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:46,879
of Brahe's observations. 

35
00:01:47,051 --> 00:01:51,723
Newton's law of gravitation thus
became the theory behind

36
00:01:51,723 --> 00:01:55,061
the trajectories described by Kepler
in the framework of heliocentrism. 

37
00:01:56,168 --> 00:02:01,347
Note by the way that Newton was
absolutely not a contemporary

38
00:02:01,347 --> 00:02:03,544
of neither Kepler nor Brahe,

39
00:02:03,544 --> 00:02:07,540
who therefore worked without any
knowledge of the law of gravitation.

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,959
What do Kepler's laws say ?

41
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,772
The first one tells us that planets
follow flat and elliptical

42
00:02:13,772 --> 00:02:17,157
trajectories with the Sun
at one of the foci.

43
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:21,919
The second one tells us that the 
radius vectors sweep out equal

44
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:25,831
areas during equals intervals of
time. 

45
00:02:25,882 --> 00:02:28,581
Finally, the third one, 
maybe the most important

46
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,200
in regard to astrophysics, tells us
that the square of the orbital period

47
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,992
is proportional to the cube of
the semi-major axis of its orbit.

48
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,625
Now back to the first Kepler's law.

49
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:41,625
We will not prove here that
the orbits are elliptical

50
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:44,800
but we will quickly show that
the orbits are flat.

51
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:52,614
To this end, we will write the angular 
momentum : m v cross r

52
00:02:52,614 --> 00:02:55,487
where v is the velocity vector
and r the radius vector.

53
00:02:55,905 --> 00:03:00,329
Lets take the derivatives of this angular momentum
with respect to time.

54
00:03:01,729 --> 00:03:05,536
We immediately see here
the velocity vector.

55
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:09,369
This vector is obviously
colinear with itself

56
00:03:10,161 --> 00:03:12,962
and therefore this whole expression vanishes.

57
00:03:13,203 --> 00:03:17,814
As we have a radial force, we 
recognise here the derivative

58
00:03:17,814 --> 00:03:20,794
of a momentum with
respect to time.

59
00:03:20,794 --> 00:03:23,438
We thus have a central force

60
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:28,152
which is colinear with the radius vector.

61
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:34,462
This means that F being parallel
to r, this expression here vanishes.

62
00:03:34,621 --> 00:03:41,680
We have then shown that the time
derivative of the angular momentum

63
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:45,340
is equal to zero,
so L has a constant norm

64
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:48,773
and direction with time.

65
00:03:48,773 --> 00:03:52,956
Therefore, the orbit lies on a plane.

66
00:03:52,956 --> 00:03:55,523
Kepler's second law
tells us that

67
00:03:55,681 --> 00:04:00,240
the radius vectors sweep out equal
areas during equal intervals of time.

68
00:04:00,844 --> 00:04:05,618
Here is a small surface element 
between two instants

69
00:04:07,876 --> 00:04:14,380
while the Earth moves
along its orbit.

70
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:18,800
We have a triangle with its altitude here.

71
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:25,483
We now seek to 
compute this area.

72
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:32,996
We have here the altitude of the triangle,
the radius vector here, Earth's velocity

73
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,825
with a certain angle with respect to 
the tangent to its orbit.

74
00:04:38,215 --> 00:04:42,005
We will call this 
surface element dA.

75
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:52,980
We then have that dA is equal to the
radius vector, which is also the base of the triangle,

76
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:55,059
times half the altitude.

77
00:04:55,059 --> 00:04:58,184
Let us express the altitude in
terms of known quantities :

78
00:04:58,184 --> 00:05:03,953
the velocity, the angle and the time
element to travel this small distance

79
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:06,190
along Earth's orbit.

80
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:09,453
We factor out the r/2.

81
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:18,479
The altitude is
v.dt times the sine of the angle.

82
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:24,841
We immediately see that the norm of
the angular momentum,

83
00:05:25,217 --> 00:05:33,611
which is m v r sin(theta), shows up 
here up to a factor m.

84
00:05:35,125 --> 00:05:39,003
We can thus rewrite the 
surface element in this way.

85
00:05:41,381 --> 00:05:45,542
Here is the norm of the
angular momentum which we

86
00:05:45,542 --> 00:05:50,920
proved previously to be constant,
over 2m times dt.

87
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:56,960
We now simply have to integrate
this in order to get the area, which

88
00:05:57,028 --> 00:05:58,772
we will express as a function of time.

89
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:02,175
We can derive the value
of this constant with

90
00:06:03,126 --> 00:06:05,241
the boundary condition that,

91
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:18,440
if t equals a full period, then A(t) is the
surface of the ellipse, pi ab

92
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:22,766
where a and b are the semi-major,
respectively the semi-minor axis.

93
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:26,220
This allows to compute exactly
the value of the constant.

94
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:37,380
Between two times t1 and t2,
we have that A(t1) - A(t2)

95
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:49,278
is equal to the norm of the angular momentum
over 2m times delta t,

96
00:06:49,278 --> 00:06:56,122
where delta t = t2 - t1.

97
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:00,520
We have thus proved the second law.

98
00:07:00,805 --> 00:07:05,378
For any t1 and t2, what is
important is the value of delta t,

99
00:07:05,378 --> 00:07:09,975
namely the time interval
between the two observations.

100
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:12,809
We can see this here.

101
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:21,936
If I draw a radius vector here
and another one here,

102
00:07:22,647 --> 00:07:25,232
the surface swept out 
by this radius vector

103
00:07:25,232 --> 00:07:30,796
must be the same that the one swept
out by the radius vectors

104
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,555
between the same times t1 and t2.

105
00:07:33,555 --> 00:07:38,354
I am here further away on the orbit so
the covered angle will be smaller.

106
00:07:39,378 --> 00:07:44,813
Here is a time t2,
and the other t2 is here.

107
00:07:46,586 --> 00:07:53,300
We have delta t here, and
the same delta t here.

108
00:07:53,910 --> 00:08:01,360
So the area swept out here is the
same one as the area swept out there.

109
00:08:02,487 --> 00:08:07,083
This implies that the bodies further
away on their orbit

110
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:12,696
are slower. Their tangential speed
along their orbit is smaller

111
00:08:12,696 --> 00:08:15,576
when further away from the body
that attracts them,

112
00:08:15,576 --> 00:08:17,720
the Sun in this specific case,

113
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,031
than when the Earth here
is closer to the Sun.

114
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:32,210
We finally see that the surface A1
here is equal to the surface A2.

115
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,385
This is for the second law.

116
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:36,931
Kepler's third law.

117
00:08:36,931 --> 00:08:40,920
This law states that the square
of the orbital period

118
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,461
is proportional to the cube of
the semi-major axis of the orbit.

119
00:08:44,461 --> 00:08:50,271
We will now prove this law in
the case of circular orbits.

120
00:08:50,271 --> 00:08:56,050
Let us consider a system of two bodies
with masses m1 and m2 orbiting around

121
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:00,414
a common centre of gravity at
distances r1 and r2.

122
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:06,686
The gravitational force that 
1 exerts on 2 is of course

123
00:09:06,734 --> 00:09:10,640
equal to minus the force by 2 on 1.

124
00:09:10,713 --> 00:09:17,872
Its value is G m1 m2 over the
distance between the two bodies,

125
00:09:17,872 --> 00:09:21,446
that is r1 + r2 squared.

126
00:09:21,446 --> 00:09:29,952
This is simply Newton's law. I
can multiply this equation

127
00:09:29,952 --> 00:09:33,622
by any quantity.

128
00:09:35,176 --> 00:09:38,834
I have here multiplied the top and
bottom part by the same quantity.

129
00:09:38,834 --> 00:09:43,587
I can now rearrange the terms

130
00:09:43,587 --> 00:09:48,500
for example by grouping
these terms here.

131
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:56,033
This term is the
 total mass of the system

132
00:09:56,033 --> 00:10:01,706
and this is another mass, which we write mu,
the reduced mass of the system.

133
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,681
With these new definitions, the
gravitational force is rewritten as

134
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:19,700
G M mu / (r1 + r2)²

135
00:10:21,267 --> 00:10:24,244
with mu being the reduced mass.

136
00:10:25,129 --> 00:10:31,660
This is equivalent to a mass mu
orbiting around the mass M

137
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:33,814
at a distance of r1 + r2.

138
00:10:33,814 --> 00:10:36,160
This situation is 
represented here.

139
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:42,159
We have here mu that orbits at a
distance r1 + r2 around a virtual mass M

140
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:45,438
that would have the total mass
of the planetary system.

141
00:10:45,938 --> 00:10:50,580
We have thus reduced problem of the
motion of two bodies

142
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,280
around a common centre of gravity

143
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:55,940
to the motion of a body mu,
with virtual mass mu,

144
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:59,640
around another virtual body
which has a mass equal

145
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,307
to the sum of the masses of the two
bodies in the planetary system.

146
00:11:04,307 --> 00:11:09,040
The distance between these two
virtual bodies is the same as here :

147
00:11:09,162 --> 00:11:10,466
r1 + r2.

148
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:15,728
Let us now consider the acceleration
of the mass mu due to mass M

149
00:11:15,728 --> 00:11:19,960
in the case of a circular orbit.

150
00:11:20,404 --> 00:11:23,606
We call it  a_mu.

151
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:31,660
It is equal to the angular velocity
squared times r1 + r2.

152
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:43,480
According to Newton's law, it is also
equal to G M / (r1 + r2)²

153
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:51,280
On the other hand, omega is equal
to 2 pi over the orbital period

154
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,080
and we can thus substitute omega here,

155
00:11:54,745 --> 00:11:57,200
omega_mu and P_mu.

156
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:15,528
I therefore get 4 pi² / P² = G M / (r1 + r2)³

157
00:12:15,683 --> 00:12:30,960
In other words, P² / (r1 + r2)³ = 4 pi² / G M

158
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:35,153
This is the distance r.

159
00:12:35,153 --> 00:12:40,500
In the case where the mass m1 is 
much larger than m2,

160
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:46,628
then the total mass M
is approximately m1.

161
00:12:46,628 --> 00:12:50,960
The centre of gravity of the
system will be inside m1,

162
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,574
almost at the centre of m1.

163
00:12:53,574 --> 00:12:59,267
We have thus that
r is approximately equal to r1.

164
00:12:59,267 --> 00:13:10,098
We can therefore rewrite this
as P²/r³ = 4 pi² / G M

165
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:13,278
which is Kepler's third law.

166
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,411
We note that this law

167
00:13:17,411 --> 00:13:20,401
does not depend on the
eccentricity of the orbit,

168
00:13:20,401 --> 00:13:23,593
defined as 1 - (b/a)²  where

169
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,480
b, a are the semi-minor, respectively
the semi-major axis of the orbit.

170
00:13:27,757 --> 00:13:32,479
This means that orbits with 
different eccentricities

171
00:13:32,609 --> 00:13:37,667
have the same orbital period as long
as the semi-major axis of the orbit

172
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:41,360
and the mass of the main 
body are set.

173
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:47,480
As a final note, if we express
the semi-major axis of the orbit

174
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:52,560
in astronomical units,
that is 150 millions of kilometres, 

175
00:13:52,973 --> 00:13:55,600
and in the case of the Earth,
a = 1,

176
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,763
since 150 million of kilometres is
the distance from Earth to the Sun,

177
00:13:59,763 --> 00:14:02,780
and if the period is expressed
in terrestrial years,

178
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:09,860
then P = 1. We have thus 
renormalized the units

179
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:13,643
of Kepler's third law
in such a way that

180
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:18,008
P²/a³ = 1 in the appropriate units.

181
00:14:18,008 --> 00:14:21,640
This is a very useful relation
in the case of the solar system.

182
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:26,200
This ends our chapter
on Kepler's laws.

183
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:29,331
We will meet them many times
during this course,

184
00:14:29,331 --> 00:14:32,173
in particular in the description

185
00:14:32,173 --> 00:14:34,799
of the shape of cometary tails,

186
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:38,058
in the expression of tidal forces
acting on the Earth and the Moon

187
00:14:38,058 --> 00:14:42,716
for example, and of course
in the search for exoplanets.
