In this section, we'll look at maneuvers and burns and consequences.
This is all extracted from training documentation at NASA's Johnson Space Center during Shuttle training.
It was more in the form of quizzes, but here, it's going to be a summary of small maneuvers we do on low Earth orbit and what the consequences are.
The first thing we'll look at is orbital velocity and altitude.
As orbital altitude increases, the orbital period increases and the orbital velocity decreases.
And this is pretty clear.
The first one is really Kepler's Law - the third Kepler's Law,
<i>T = 2Ï€ âˆš (a^3/Î¼)</i>.
In the case of a circular orbit, of course, it's <i>2Ï€ âˆš (r^3/Î¼)</i> and that's proportional to <i>âˆš (r^3)</i>, and this, of course, increases as <i>r</i> increases.
Now, for the second point, the orbital velocity, we have the <i>V_circ</i>, we saw that before,
<i>V_circ = âˆš (Î¼/r)</i>
So, proportional to <i>1/ âˆš (r)</i>.
And that's going to be decreasing as <i>r</i> increases.
So that's pretty clear.
Period increases as you go up, and orbital velocity decreases.
Now, let's look at change of velocity as we go in an elliptical orbit.
We have the perigee, with <i>V_p</i> being the perigee.
Here, we have the apogee with <i>V_a</i>.
And the second law of Kepler is such that <i>r_aâˆ™V_a = r_pâˆ™V_p.</i>
Large velocity at the perigee, and small velocity at the apogee.
Let's look at in-plane burns.
Again, this is a summary, and this is all extracted from training documentation at NASA's Johnson Space Center for the Shuttle.
We looked at posigrade burns.
If we have here a <i>Î”V</i>, posigrade, which means in the direction of the velocity vector, we'll go from a circular orbit, initial circular orbit, to an elliptical orbit, with the apogee which will be above the initial circular orbit.
And you'll remember that we had the simplified expression,
<i>Î”r equal about 3.5 Î”V</i>.
This is valid for low Earth orbit, and this is <i>Î”r</i> in kilometers and <i>Î”V</i> in meters per second.
So, posigrade <i>Î”V</i> - posigrade, meaning in the direction of the velocity vector - will increase the altitude of the orbit,
180Â° from the burn point.
Now, the opposite case, if we have a retrograde <i>Î”V</i>, which we have here, we go from an initial circular orbit to a <i>lower</i> orbit, which will have its perigee
180Â° away from the burn point, lower than the initial circular orbit radius.
And we have the same expression of <i>Î”r = 3.5 Î”V</i>, but this time in the other direction.
Now, in the bottom drawing, we have the interesting case of a so-called radial burn.
At this point, we are at the perigee of this elliptical orbit, and we do a pure radial burn toward the center of the Earth.
So, this will basically not change the amplitude or the velocity that we have at this point. It's <i>V perigee</i>.
The amplitude will not change, so the energy of the orbit will not change either, because the kinetic energy is unchanged, which means that the semi-major axis of the resulting orbit will remain the same.
Now, as we have at this point a negative flight path angle, we are moving towards the perigee of our new orbit.
So, the consequence of such a burn, of a radial burn, is going to be a shift of the line of apsides of our elliptical orbit.
This is the resulting orbit, with a line of apsides that has been shifted versus the original line of apsides.
Now, if we want to do a plane change, which is normally not recommended, because it demands a lot of propellants, but if we really want to do it, we need to do it at the junction of the two orbits, the nodal crossing.
If we want to go, for instance, to this orbit here, we just have to do a <i>Î”V</i> perpendicular, or across, the <i>V</i> that we have, in order to get to the new orbit.
We need to do this as we are crossing the equator.
