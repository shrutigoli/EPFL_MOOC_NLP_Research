Hello, my name is Simone Deparis,
I am senior scientist in mathematics at EPFL.
In teaching and research, I often use
MATLAB and Octave.
But what is Octave, what is MATLAB?
These are mathematical softwares to help perform simple calculations, but also to solve complex problems.
In this course, you will learn to take the first steps in these softwares.
Why present two software at the same time?
For similar tasks, Octave and MATLAB are very similar, they use the same language.
MATLAB is commercial software developed and sold by MathWorks,
Octave is then developed by passsionate developers who distribute it freely under GPL.
These two characteristics make one company or school choose one or the other.
Both are able to handle very complex problems and have many toolbox, that is to say complementary tools resolution of specific problems.
In this course, we will not study them, but we will rather focus on handling the software so that you can, thereafter, continue to learn by yourself over the Internet.
At the end of this course, I expect you to know how to use the software, use scripts and functions, work with vectors and matrices, processing data files, generate graphics and save them in PDF or JPEG format and write small interactive programs.
The first thing to do is choose between
MATLAB and Octave.
I can not make that choice for you, and besides, you can always change your mind or use both,depending on the circumstances.
To help, discuss with your colleagues or browse on the Internet.
If the software is not yet installed on your computer visit one of these sites.
