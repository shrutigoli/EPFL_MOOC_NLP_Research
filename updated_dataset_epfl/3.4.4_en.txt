Let's talk now about the rendezvous profile, the profile of the orbit of the chaser versus a target is basically represented in a one-dimensional plane which is a plane of the orbit of the target, at least a plane of the orbit of the target at the end of the rendezvous.
There is one important parameter, which is phase angle <i>Ï†</i>.
It's the angle between the radius vector from the center of the Earth to the chaser, and the other radius vector from the center of the Earth to the target.
<i>Ï†</i> can be relatively large at installation of the chaser into its orbit its orbit is always below and, of course, behind the target, so the chaser will chase the target coming from behind and below.
And the phase angle <i>Ï†</i>, which, again, can be 180 degrees or even more, initially will come down until it gets to zero at the time of rendezvous itself.
The phasing rate, or catch-up rate, is time derivative of the <i>Ï†</i> angle, and, of course, the phasing rate is a function of the differential altitude because of the third Kepler's law.
The low orbit of the chaser makes it catch up with the target.
But, of course, we have also to change the energy of the orbit of the chaser and come to a higher altitude, at the altitude of the orbit of the target to complete the rendezvous.
The coordinate system we'll use to represent the motion of the chaser versus the target is the following.
And it's important to give a clear consideration of that.
We have the coordinate system centered on the target, with <i>Z</i>, the vertical axis to the center of the Earth.
We have the <i>X</i> axis in the direction of motion of the target and the direction of the velocity vector, and we will, out of convention, always have the velocity vector of the target and of the chaser also, to the left on the picture.
Now, we have the chaser which is below and behind the target.
Of course, its velocity vector has an amplitude which is larger than the amplitude of the velocity of the target, because it is lower, so this is the <i>V_chaser</i>.
So it is going to be slowly catching up with the target.
Now, the coordinate system we talked about before is represented in the lower left here and, in fact, the way we represent it either way you have it on the upper right of the picture, we will put the Earth's surface being flat and we'll put the <i>X</i> axis, which is, in fact, curvilinear, we'll put it as a straight horizontal line with <i>X</i> to the left in the direction of the velocity vector of the target.
This is the way we'll have all our plots of the motion of the chaser versus the target done in the next sessions.
So, again, we have the chaser with an initial horizontal velocity vector <i>V_chaser</i> with a larger amplitude than the <i>V_TGT</i>.
So if you don't do anything, we will have the chaser just passing below the target, horizontally below the target.
Obviously this is not a properly completed rendezvous, but this is part of it, and we will see what we do in order to really perform the rendezvous between chaser and target.
Again, roughly between 6 hours and 48 hours after lift-off of the chaser.
Now, this is out of NASA documentation: the rendezvous profile of the Space Shuttle with the target.
And the target, again, could be either the Hubble Space Telescope or the International Space Station from the the point designated MECO. 
MECO is Main Engine CutOff.
It's 8.5 minutes after lift-off of the Space Shuttle, when it has reached orbital velocity, and right after that we have separation of the external tank, and the Shuttle is just by itself.
Now, it happened that at MECO, the orbit of the Space Shuttle is an elliptical orbit that will have its apogee at this point here.
So we go from this altitude to that altitude between main engine cutoff and the apogee of these orbits.
Now, this orbit is represented in this coordinate frame centered on the target on the upper left of the picture with the horizontal axis, or the <i>X</i> axis, which has the same distance to the surface of the Earth and vertical axis is designated here, <i>R bar</i>, it's toward the center of the Earth.
The <i>X</i> axis, in the NASA language, is sometimes designated as a <i>V bar</i> axis.
So we are on this elliptical orbit that has the apogee at this altitude, still below the circular orbit altitude of the target
At this point we perform a so-called OMS-2 maneuver which is a <i>Î”V</i> posigrade, <i>Î”V</i> in the direction of the velocity vector in order to raise the perigee.
So at this point we are on a new elliptical orbit of the Shuttle which has the perigee at this point, and the apogee at that point.
Now, you have to note that the <i>a</i> value or the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit of the Shuttle at this point is here, it's just the average value of the apogee and perigee altitude.
Of course, <i>a</i> is here smaller than <i>r</i>,
<i>r</i> is the radius of the circular orbit of the target.
Now, remember we looked previously at the catch-up rate of the chaser versus the target when we have a difference between <i>r</i> and <i>a</i>.
Basically as a first approximation we have for each orbit <i>Î”X</i>,
<i>Î”X</i> in this direction towards the left, will be <i>3 Ï€ (r - a)</i>
As <i>r - a</i> is positive here, we will have a general motion towards the left of the Space Shuttle.
Now, it just happens that we perform a certain number of maneuvers called NC-1, NC-2, NPC-1.
I won't go into the exact description of these, but the idea is to increase slowly the energy of the orbit of the chaser.
At this point we have the transformation of our elliptical orbit here with perigee here and apogee here into a circular orbit with a constant distance to the surface of the Earth.
Then we go, again, to an elliptical orbit with the apogee here and the perigee here, so we really gradually increase the energy of the orbit of the chaser, respectively we increase the value of <i>a</i>, the semi-major axis until we come to a point here, the NC4 point, where we have the apogee of the elliptical orbit of the chaser at the altitude of the circular orbit of the target.
Here we are, NC4, and that's interesting to see that we have kind of a loop here.
And why do we have a loop?
So that the motion of the chaser versus the target when we get to this NC4 point is toward the right, and it's pretty obvious, because the relative motion of chaser versus the target to the right means that we have a lower velocity of the chaser when it reaches the altitude of the circular orbit of the target than the target itself.
And it's obvious, because the value of <i>a</i>, of the elliptical orbit of the chaser, which is about here. This is <i>a</i>.
This is the perigee of the orbit, this is the apogee.
The value of <i>a</i> is smaller than <i>r</i>, the radius of the circular orbit of the target.
So we know that the energy per unit mass,
<i>Îµ = - Î¼ / 2a</i>.
So, if we have <i>a</i> which is smaller, the energy is less, and at this point, the NC4 point, the potential energy of both the target and the chaser is the same, because we're at the same altitude, and as the <i>a</i> of the orbit of the chaser is less than the <i>r</i>, radius of the circular orbit of the target, then we have less total energy for the chaser, which means that we have less velocity.
And in these plots, or in this coordinate system, centered on the target, it means that we have to have a motion to the right.
But rapidly afterwards, when it comes down toward the perigee of the new orbit of the chaser, we come here, at the perigee of the orbit of the chaser, and we end up again at this point, <i>T_i</i>, point behind the target still at the same altitude.
Now, we need to do something here, because if we would not do anything we would continue on a similar orbit as the preceding one and, of course, we'll catch up to the target, but will come eventually in front of it.
So we need to perform a maneuver to increase the energy of the orbit of the chaser so that we have now a perigee such that the new <i>a</i> value of the last orbit of the chaser versus the target is such that <i>Î”X</i>, performed in the last orbit, will be exactly equal to the distance between the <i>T_i</i> point and the target.
And we have approximate values that we determined earlier.
If we want to have a certain <i>Î”X</i>, we need to have a certain <i>Î”r</i>, or a certain difference between the <i>r</i> and the <i>a</i> of the elliptical orbit of the chaser in order to perform the <i>Î”X</i>.
So it's relatively easy to calculate the <i>Î”V</i> and necessary in order to, on the very last orbit, have a catch-up of <i>Î”X</i> exactly equal to the distance between <i>T_i</i> and target.
