Now that we've seen the simple comparator,
I would like to introduce what we call a positive reaction.
We've talked about the negative reaction, the negative feedback, and here, we're going to talk about positive feedback.
The comparator is here.
We've added a resistant divisor at the output.
And behaves like that.
The resistant divisor will take the voltage <i>Vout</i>, and reduce it by multiplying it by
<i>R2/R1 + R2</i>, and taking it to the positive terminal and add it to the input.
We can come to a simple conclusion here to show how it would behave in this type of circuit as we did with the same circuit when it was in negative feedback.
In negative feedback, remember what we did before.
We called this a negative reaction when we had inverted the plus and the minus.
When the minus was here, we did the same operation, we have reduced the voltage output but we subtracted that to an op-amp and when we studied that, we said, that it was called a negative reaction because
the relationship between <i>Vin</i> and <i>Vout</i> was linear and that our amplifier when in a negative reaction, meaning when the resistant divisor reduces the voltage, will take it to the negative terminal, it fixes our amplifier in the linear zone, it could also have one of the values that appear here and our amplifier won't move, it will stay here because there is a unique linear reaction between <i>Vin</i> and <i>Vout</i> that passes through the value of the resistance, or the resistances <i>R1</i> et <i>R2</i>.
So, whatever the values are here, the amp doesn't move, it stays here.
Now, if you take the same circuit, and look at the circuit, but this time, we're going to put the reduced voltage output onto the positive terminal.
Let's take an example.
We've got a state at the input, <i>Vin</i>.
We're going to use the example that <i>Vin</i> equals 1.
Remember that <i>Vout</i> can only have one of two values, either saturation positive, or saturation negative.
And at the moment when we plug in our comparator, we don't know if it's here, or here.
It could be either.
Suppose that we find that
<i>Vout</i> is equal to <i>Vsat+</i>.
Here, if the power supply is 15V, so we have 15V,
15V, we'll take the same example as before, meaning that I've got <i>R</i> and <i>R</i>, the same value, therefore, if I've the same value,
I'll find myself here with <i>Vout</i> times 1/2 so, I'll get 7.5V.
7.5 is much greater than 1V, so the plus is greater than the minus, so, nothing will happen, it will stay here.
So, there's nothing that will trigger the comparator in this situation.
The only thing that could trigger it is this.
It's that if we find ourselves in this situation, and that <i>Vin</i> equalises with a transition voltage, that I'm going to call <i>VT</i>, that is equal to 7.5.
So, we're going to change this voltage from 1 to 7.5 meaning that the voltage that you see on the <i>V-</i> compared to 7.5 that was on the <i>V+</i>.
If the transition voltage equals, this one here equals this one here, it's as if we were saying that we've got to here.
We've changed the voltage, and we've got a voltage transition, and here, my comparator, if by chance 7.5 is an epsilon greater than 7.5, that's it, the negative terminal is greater than the positive and it will trigger the comparator from 15v that will seek out the -15v, because here, the voltage at the negative terminal has gone over the positive value.
So, we're talking about the transition voltage that will trigger our comparator.
And here, once it has switched over here, we can add a minus sign here, and we'll keep the same condition until, once more, the transition voltage goes over 7.5 because if the voltage here wasn't 7.5, nothing would happen, we'd be either here, or here.
So, you'd still find yourselves with either
<i>Vsat+</i>, or <i>Vsat-</i>.
There isn't any other option for the voltage <i>Vout</i>.
We're going to take our comparators again and we're going to add the circuit that you see around it.
Meaning that, this time,
 we're going to do two things.
We've added a resistant divisor <i>R2</i> and <i>R1</i>, that has got an output voltage <i>V2</i> and an input voltage <i>V1</i> but we've also added a voltage reference, a DC value that we're going to put at the negative input.
We're going to analyse what happens and you'll see, this is called non-inverting threshold comparator, or a Schmitt trigger, and we'll look at it in the following way.
If you take the voltage <i>V2</i>, so <i>V2</i>, as always, can only be <i>VH</i> or <i>VL</i>.
<i>VH</i> is <i>Vsat+</i>, <i>VL</i> for <i>Vsat-</i>, which are generally around about <i>+Vcc</i>, <i>-Vcc</i>, but these, these are values linked to comparators that we purchase and that we use, there are different values of <i>VH</i> and of <i>VL</i> found on the market and it depends on the power voltage.
We've understood that the comparator will
 react by comparing <i>V+</i> with <i>V-</i>.
So now, I should look at what's
happening in the node <i>A</i>, and I should compare it to what's happening in the node <i>Vref</i>.
In order to understand what's going on in the node <i>A</i>, take this part of the circuit, and draw it on the side.
So we know <i>R1</i> and <i>R2</i>, the node <i>A</i>.
I would like to know what happens with the voltage <i>vA</i> compared to <i>Vref</i> to see if <i>vA</i> is greater than <i>Vref</i>.
We've just seen that the comparator is going to go towards <i>Vsat+</i>, and the opposite, it's going towards <i>Vsat-</i>.
So, I'd like to write this voltage <i>VA</i>.
By analysing this part, the superposition principle allows us to read it in the following way.
I'm going to start by...
I'm going to start by cancelling <i>V2</i>.
So, I short circuit <i>V2</i> to the volume. and I express <i>VA</i> in function to <i>V1</i>.
And it gives me this.
So <i>VA = V1 R2/R1 + R2</i>, as long as <i>V2 = 0</i>.
I'll do the same over this side here.
I put <i>V1 = 0</i> and I look at <i>VA</i> in function to <i>V2</i> and I find this second part here, so I find that
<i>VA = V2 R1/R1 + R2</i>.
Coming from this postulate,
I get the voltage <i>VA</i>
129e that depends on <i>V1</i> an on <i>V2</i>.
I know <i>V2</i>.
<i>V2</i> can only be <i>VH</i> and <i>VL</i>.
Now, what's happening to <i>V1</i>?
<i>V1</i>, is the input voltage that the user plugs in, it's a voltage that varies over time, and the voltage <i>VA</i> will subject the variation of <i>V1</i> depending on if <i>V2</i> is <i>VH</i> or <i>VL</i>.
So, we're going to decide to proceed in the following way.
We're going to take example 1 and consider that we're starting with <i>V2 = VH</i>.
So, the output tension is equal to a voltage of <i>Vsat+, VH</i>.
And we ask ourselves this: what is the value of <i>V1</i> that will allow V2 to transit the value <i>VH</i> to the value <i>VL</i>?
So we ask ourselves this question.
When varying, it will cause <i>A</i> to vary, knowing that <i>V2</i> is fixed.
Watch, <i>VA</i> depends on <i>V1</i> and <i>V2</i> but <i>V2</i> is fixed, there is only on value <i>V1</i> for which this node here is equal to this node here, and straight away <i>V2</i> will witch states, it will pass from one value to
another, and in doing so, we want to see what the value is.
We were at <i>VH</i> and we want to go towards a voltage <i>VL</i>.
So, we're going to call the voltage <i>V1 = VT1</i>, the value for which, when <i>V1 = VT1</i>,
<i>V2</i> will switch from <i>VH</i> to <i>VL</i>.
So, I'm going to replace <i>V1</i> with <i>VT1</i> because I'm asking myself what is the value of this <i>V1</i>, that I'm going to call <i>VT1</i>, for which the voltage <i>V2</i>, which is nothing more than equal to <i>VH</i>, will switch when <i>VA = Vref</i>.
So I will get the switch.
And here's the reasoning that I've just done.
I replaced <i>V1</i> with <i>VT1</i>.
I replaced <i>V2</i> with <i>VH</i>.
And I watch <i>VA</i> and I'm going to say that when <i>VA = Vref</i>, it's when this equals this, that I've the right to put this and this because it's at this point, that the switch will occur and that the famous <i>VH</i> will switch and become equal to <i>VL</i>.
So I should say what is the value of <i>VT1</i> for which <i>VH</i> will switch to <i>VL</i>.
And the calculation comes from this analysis.
I expressed i>VT1 and that gave me this relationship that I replaced by a simple reading,
<i>Vref R1 + R2/R2</i> by a value that I call <i>V'ref</i>.
So that can give me this simple relationship that has the transition value <i>VT1</i>.
And this transition value <i>VT1</i> for which
I've the transition that I see here.
Meaning that we have the state
<i>V2 = VH</i> here.
We get to a value of <i>VT1</i>.
Watch, <i>V1</i> goes down,
<i>V2</i> remains equal to <i>VH</i>.
Nothing happens.
We get to a value of <i>VT1</i>.
<i>VT1</i> corresponds to the potential value <i>VA = Vref</i>.
So immediately my comparator switches, and the output goes back to being equal to <i>VL</i>.
So it's certain than <i>V2</i> is either this, or this, nothing else.
And we have lots of possible values for <i>V1</i>.
And it's only one value that will push my resistant divisor to bring the potential to the node <i>A</i> so that it is equal to the potential at <i>Vref</i> and it's here that the
comparator changes the output and switches from here to here.
We're going to look at the same circuit and this time we're going to look at when <i>V2 = VL</i>.
We're at <i>VL</i>.
We've got <i>V2 = VL</i> and we're going to see what happens when now there is a change from <i>VL</i> to <i>VH</i>.
So I'd like to go backwards using the same relationships, but this time replacing <i>V2</i> with <i>VL</i>, and I'm going to call <i>V1</i> <i>VT2</i>, because it's a transition to another value.
And I'm going to replace <i>V2</i> with <i>VL</i> and I write here and say that when
<i>VA = Vref</i>, this transition will take place and I can calculate the expression as I did earlier on.
And here are the results once <i>VT2</i> is expressed in function to our <i>Vref</i> and the negative voltage saturation of the comparator.
In the same way, I replace the term that
I've got here, to make it easier to read the formula, by a value that I call <i>Vref</i>, and I find a second voltage switch <i>VT2</i> in order that my output voltage passed from
<i>VL</i> Ã  <i>VH</i> and that, this time, the transition goes up.
So we increase <i>V1</i>, there are all the values, nothing happens to the output of the comparator, it's going to stay in negative saturation, it will arrive at a calculated value that corresponds to <i>VT2</i>, and here, the comparator will sense that the <i>V+</i>, the positive input, becomes greater than the negative input, and it can only compare the two, therefore it switches and will find itself with a positive voltage saturation that is <i>VH</i>.
I'd like to accumulate the two
curves from earlier on, and we get this type of curve.
In both cases, when the output was <i>VH</i>, and we have a transition to <i>VL</i>, and we call the voltage <i>V1 = VT1</i> for which there was this transition, and we ended up with <i>VL</i>, and this time we increased <i>V1</i> and look what happens.
We found ourselves at <i>VH</i> and we started to reduce <i>V1</i>.
<i>V1</i> is going down.
We went via here <i>VT2</i>, nothing happened.
We got <i>VT1</i>.
When we reached <i>VT1</i>, the comparator switched over.
It had <i>VL</i>.
Now, we can continue to decrease <i>V1</i>, nothing happens, it stays at <i>VL</i>.
If we go in the opposite direction, and in the opposite direction, we are now increasing <i>V1</i>, we are going in the direction here, and we arrive here
<i>V1</i> is <i>VT1</i>, nothing happens.
We need to keep going until we reach here, around the value <i>VT2</i> and, voila, the comparator switches to <i>VT2</i>.
So, we find ourselves with a schema that has two possible outcomes, one that switcher to <i>VH</i>, and one that switches to <i>VL</i>, but they aren't found in the same place.
The simple comparator has a unique threshold value at which it switches each time.
This type of comparator has two threshold values, and between the two, it depends on which direction it goes, if it passes the first value, it will switch to the second, if it passes in this direction, it passes to the first value and switches to the second.
We call this shape a hysteresis loop, and we call it a non-inverting hysteresis threshold comparator
And why do we call in "non-inverting"?
The term "non-inverting" comes from the fact that when <i>V1</i> increases, at a given moment, the output will also increase from <i>VL</i> Ã  <i>VH</i> following it for a value.
The same when <i>V1</i> decreases, we arrive at a value where the output voltage
follows in a binary action, where it was at, it will come to <i>VL</i>.
So, if you make the width of this hysteresis, this famous <i>Î”VT</i>, that is the difference between <i>VT1</i> and <i>VT2</i>, you'll find that <i>Î”VT</i> is proportional to the resistance relationship that you will have added, <i>R1/R2</i>, that multiplies the difference of the voltage saturation of your comparator.
And you'll see now what happens with your voltage reference, if you move this point here, you'll see that the whole window will follow in function to the value of <i>Vref</i>.
The width of your hysteresis depends therefore on the resistance relationship and voltage saturation, however, the reference value that you added, will be centred and will move your window from one place to another, so you can compare that in function to this
<i>Vref</i>.
We're talking here about a memory effect.
We say that your hysteresis comparator retains the information here.
So here, it passed, it didn't switch, it continued to have a memory effect, and it switched again further on, the same in this direction, so there is a memory effect.
It remembers the state in which it was before.
It keeps it for longer before switching to another state, it's the same in both directions.
I suggest that you test it for yourselves in a laboratory.
So, take a comparator, and plug in a resistance <i>R2 = 100kÎ©</i>, a resistance <i>R1 = 10kÎ©</i>, take note of the relationships that we calculated earlier on, to make a numerical calculation in function to the resistance values that I gave you, taking into account the <i>VH</i> and <i>VL</i> of a comparator on the market.
There are different types of these comparators.
Generally, the voltage saturations are symmetrical.
Not always, we sometimes find asymmetry in some of these values, but here, I've chosen a comparator that has a voltage saturation of 13V for <i>VH</i>, so <i>Vsat+ = 13</i> and <i>Vsat- = -13</i>.
And at the same time, I ask you to take a voltage <i>V1</i> and plug in a triangular signal that has a peak value equal to +10V and -10V, and plug it in here and put a continuous voltage <i>Vref = 3V</i>.
So to compare this node <i>A</i>, that we talked about earlier on, to the value that we find here that equals 3V, so we put 3V here.
We're going to arrive for sure at a given state.
<i>V1</i> will vary depending on this curve.
While <i>V1</i> varies, this is fixed,
<i>VA</i> will follow the variation of <i>V1</i>.
At a given moment, <i>VA</i> will equal 3V and your voltage will switch in one direction, and then, switch back to the other direction depending on <i>VT1</i> and <i>VT2</i> that come from the analytic relationships that we've already calculated.
And here's what happens.
You will have a voltage <i>VT1</i>, that's here, that equals 2V.
You will have a voltage <i>VT2</i> that equals 4.6V and you will have the comparison between your triangular signal and these two voltage levels that
 appear with the output of your <i>V2</i>.
Therefore <i>V2</i>, is either at 13V when we are over <i>VT2</i>, and we are at -13V when we are below <i>VT1</i>.
And so we have the <i>Î”VT</i> that appears here.
This is our <i>Î”VT</i> that is found between <i>VT2 - VT1</i>, so the sum of 2.6V between the two and that will be centred in
relationship to the 3v, that we can, by changing the 3V, move up or down, which is what we'll see during the
experiment once we have plugged in this type of circuit to a oscilloscope.
So here's our experiment, now to the laboratory, so our comparator, that has to voltage switches:
<i>VT1</i>, that allows the output to pass to <i>Vsat+</i>,
<i>VT2</i>, that allows the output to descend to <i>Vsat-</i>.
And now, this output state that you see here, whether it be at <i>Vsat+</i> or <i>Vsat-</i>, is managed by a comparison with the triangular signal.
We are changing the reference voltage and you are learning how we move the hysteresis window on the input of this comparator.
Here, the width of the window stays the same, however, moving it means we can increase or increase the states <i>Vsat+</i> and <i>Vsat-</i>.
