In this video I will talk to you about interpolation of degree 1 by interval. 
I will consider a function f defined in the interval [a,b].
Let x_i be equidistant points in the interval [a,b] such that x_i = a+((b-a)/N)*i for i=0,1, ... N.
Here the interval [a,b], the variable x.
The function f defined on the interval [a,b]. I choose a certain number of equidistant points on this interval [a,b] called x0, x1, x2, x3 and x4.
So here is the function f(x) on the interval [a,b] and I will build the function f_h the following way
This function f_h will be the interpolant by intervals of degree 1 of the function f.
This function is continuous on the interval
[a,b] and should coincide with the function f at points x_i for all i = 0,1, ... N.
In this notation we used the letter h, but what is it ?
It is the following: h = (b-a)/N, the distance between two consecutive points. 
This h approaches 0, or equivalently
N approaches infinity.
So the functions f and f_h must be equal at nodes x_i. 
Furthermore f_h restrained such that on every sub-interval x_i to x_(i+1) f_h is a polynomial of degree 1 for i = 0,1, ... N-1.
So f_h on the interval x0 to x1 is a polynomial of degree 1 passing through (x0,f(x0)) and (x1,f(x1)) and so on for the sub-intervals x1 to x2, x2 to x3 and x3 to x4. Each time it is a different polynomial of degree 1.
Here is the function f_h of x; the question
I want to answer is: does f_h converge, somehow, to the function f as h approaches 0, or as N approaches +infinity. 
The error is here. I will consider the maximum of this error on the interval [a,b].
The theoretical result is the following: theorem 1.2 in the book: a positive C exists such that the function f is twice differentiable on the interval [a,b]. 
This is the case for my drawing.
For all h positive we have the error
(f_h(x)-f(x)), by taking the absolute value of this error and considering the maximum on the interval [a,b]; we get the error visible here.
This error is smaller then C*(h^2) times the maximum of the second derivative of f on the interval [a,b].
According to this theorem, C does not depend on neither h nor f, hence there exists for all h and all f a value C depending on neither h nor f.
The meaning of this theorem is the following in practice: we choose a function twice differentiable on the interval [a,b]. For a given h we measure the error and must observe that this error is at least divide by 2^2, so 4, each time h is divide by 2.
