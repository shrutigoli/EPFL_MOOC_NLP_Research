Hello, in the previous lectures, we have treated the case of RC or RL circuits that lead to some differential equations of the 1st order, and then to homogenous solutions of exponential type.
During today's lecture we will see the case of a voltage jump, continuous voltage, in an RLC circuit in series.
For the equation layout of the circuit, the methodology stays the same, but the solutions that we will find will be very different because the differential equation resulting from the circuit proposed, is of the 2nd order.
Let's consider the following circuit, made of a continuous voltage supply, of a switch and of three elements R, L, and C in series.
We start with the values of the circuit. i(t) the voltage drop across the resistor
U_r(t) the voltage drop at the inductance terminals 
U_l(t) and, the voltage drop at the terminals of the capacitor
U_c(t) the voltage at the terminals of the three elements, that we call U(t).
For a time t >= 0, we could write the following equation 
U is equal to
R*i + L*(di/dt), the voltage drop at the terminals of the inductance, plus the voltage drop at the terminals of the capacitor : 1/C * âˆ«[-âˆž, t] i(t)*dt.
By deriving this equation, we get the following equation
L * (d^2*i/dt) + R*(di/dt) + 1/C * i = 0, the derivative of U.
At this 2nd order differential equation we can associate the following characteristic equation
Î»^2 * L + Î»*R + 1/C = 0.
It is a 2nd degree equation we will then determine the solutions Î»_1 and Î»_2.
This equation of second degree, present two solutions et Î»_2 that are given by the constant terms of the characteristic equation with a difference a + for the first solution, and a - for the second solution.
For visibility matters, we will substitute the square root with the term Ï‰, and we then get
Î» is equal to
-R/2L Â± Ï‰.
Supposing these two equations we can rewrite the current equation i(t) is equal to
A_1*e^(Î»_1*t) + A_2*e^(Î»_2*t)
The constant A_1 and A_2 have to be defined.
In order to determine the integration constants
A_1 and A_2, we position at time t = 0 knowing that at that instant there is no current jump in the circuit, because of the inductance in series.
Writing the equation of the current at time t=0, we get the following equation this equation, allows us to determine a first relation between A_1 and A_2, that we substitute in the temporal equation of the current, that leads us to the following relation:
We can develop this equation knowing that the constant Î»_1 is equal to
-R/2L + Ï‰. the same for Î»_2, if we substitute in the previous equation, we get the exponential term
-R/2L times (e^(Ï‰t) - e^(-Ï‰t)).
For this case, we put the conditions at time t=0 but we know that the current at time t=0 is equal to 0.
The voltage at the terminals of the capacitor at time t=0, is equal to 0 the capacitor is initially empty.
This gives us, the voltage across the resistor at time t = 0 is equal to R times i(0) is equal to 0 and, the voltage at the terminals of the capacitor at time t=0, is equal to 0. we therefore still have for the binding equation at time t=0
U, the supply voltage which is equal to
L*(di/dt), the two other terms disappear.
At this instant of the development three cases have to be considered as function of the value of the discriminant under the scare root this discriminant Î” is equal to
(R^2/4L^2) - 1/LC. the three cases are the followings:
Either the discriminant is bigger than 0 in that case we get two real solutions.
That solution is called 'over-damped'.
In the second case the discriminant is smaller than 0 we will find two complex solutions, we are dealing with a "damped oscillation" solution
And in the third case , when the discriminant is equal to 0 we have an unique and real solution, we are dealing in this cas with a
"critical damping" solution.
We started dealing the case of an RLC circuit in series switched under a continuous supply voltage
The used methodology remains the same 
The nature of the current leads to a differential equation of the 2nd order.
The solutions for the current i(t) will be dependent of the discriminant.
The link between the values R, L and C will determine the nature of the solution, and of the current.
During next lecture, we will deal with the three cases of the discriminant will lead us to three different solutions.
