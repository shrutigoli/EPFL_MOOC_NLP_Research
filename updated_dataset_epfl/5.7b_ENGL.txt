Hello.
Welcome to this module on Local Treatment Solutions.
My name is Juliette Ndounla.
I'm a post-doctoral researcher at Sandec, the Department of Water and Sanitation in Developing Countries, at the Swiss Federal Institute for Aquatic Science and Technology.
Today I will present a case study of water quantity and water quality issues from Dschang, a small town in Cameroon, here in the west region and from some villages of the Yitenga province in Burkina Faso, around here.
As we can notice, in several rural and pre-rural areas in Africa, as well as in many developing countries, people face the challenge of unsafe drinking water for their daily activities.
This water could be collected from wells, rivers, lakes, and directly from rainwater.
River and well water may be readily available, but polluted with biological and chemical contaminants, especially during the rainy season, due to runoff water and floods.
Considering the water quantity issue, it can be noticed that water supply is not equally distributed within these countries.
In the south, water is usually available in enough quantity, particularly in Cameroon, which is situated near the Equatorial line.
However, this water is subject to high contamination levels, especially during the rainy season, while the north of both countries is subject to serious water shortages during the drought, the [inaudible] of the dry season.
The water quality issue--
We noticed the presence of total coliforms,
<i>E. coli</i>, coliforms, and salmonella bacteria in several drinking water sources from these countries.
The consequence of these is the serious outbreak of water-related diseases, such as typhoid, cholera, and dysentery.
These were noticed, recorded in both of these countries, as a consequence of unsafe drinking water supply.
As presented in the previous slide,
Dschang is situated in the western region of Cameroon.
In Dschang, water is available all year long.
However, as the water table is near the surface in [inaudible], in Dschang, the people from such places use, regularly, unimproved wells, as the one present here, using a car wheel for the well superstructure.
These traditional, unprotected wells are regularly contaminated with air and surface pollution, and runoff water.
The presence of shoes and leaves could be noticed in such water, also heavy contamination of bacteria such as salmonella typhi, entamoeba histolytica,
[inaudible], lead to water-related diseases such as typhoid or dysentery.
These water-related diseases and several other gastroenteritis are regularly experienced by well-users in Dschang.
The turbidity of this water is regularly more than 100 NTU,
[inaudible] here.
To reduce the health vulnerability when using water from your unimproved well, the owner uses traditional filters made with locally available materials such as sheet metal, old nylon sacks, old mattresses under the old nylon sacks, and stones.
This homemade filter shown here reduced the water turbidity to less than 13 NTU, as it can be observed here.
However, this filter process cannot make this water completely safe for drinking purposes.
To be safe for drinking, this water will require additional disinfecting steps, such as solar disinfection or chlorination.
In Burkina Faso, <i>Moringa Oleifera</i> is used as the local solution for water purification in some villages.
<i>Moringa Oleifera</i> is a tropical tree from which seed can be ground to a powder and used as a natural coagulant.
People from the villages situated around the Yitenga-Pouytenga dam often use <i>Moringa</i> seed powder for their drinking water purification, especially to reduce turbidity.
The <i>Moringa</i> seed powder process and efficiencies in water purification has been scientifically evaluated and recommended.
This method is more efficient than using a homemade filter, shown in the previous slide, and the steps are simple and easy to practice.
The purifying principle of clarification not only diminishes chemical contamination but also harmful bacteria.
Remaining on local solutions used by village people, we find also in the Yitenga region that some people were using aluminum sulfate for their water purification.
However, aluminum is expensive, and if improperly used may be linked to health problems or environmental pollution.
Using <i>Moringa Oleifera</i> instead to purify water efficiently replaces such chemical products.
The <i>Moringa</i> process for water purification--
First they begin with the grinding of dry seed into powder.
The powder should be put after in a small quantity of water, approximately 250 ml, and shaken for approximately five minutes.
Then after, this small quantity of water is put in the water to be treated, here it's 20 liters, and rapidly stirred for two minutes, and after slowly stirred for 10-15 minutes, before leaving the water undisturbed for approximately one hour, or until the water is clear, depending on the initial turbidity of the water.
When all the impurities are settled down the water should now be filtered, and put in a safe container before being drunk by the family members.
The main recommendation for the <i>Moringa</i> seed dosage is to consider the water source, as water from marine sources will need a different amount of <i>Moringa</i> powder because the impurities present will not be the same.
It's also recommended to make a jar test to help in evaluating the correct amount of the powder needed.
However, this table provides the general guidelines for the dosage.
In the presence of low turbidity, less than 50 NTU, the recommendation is to use one seed per four liters, and in the presence of extreme turbidity, more than 250 NTU, you would need two seeds per liter of water.
Like many other water treatment processes, the use of <i>Moringa Oleifera</i> seed powder in water treatment also has some limitations.
It could lead to secondary infection if the process of shaking or stirring is not well handled.
This process of shaking and handling should be followed closely to activate the coagulant properties, because if the flocculation process takes too long there is a risk of secondary bacteria growth during the flocculation.
The treated water could also face recontamination if the settling process is not well handled.
It should be noticed that the sediment at the bottom of the water, after settling, contains some impurities. so care must be taken to use only the clear water on the top, and not allow the sediment to recontaminate the clear water after the treatment.
We should also consider that <i>Moringa</i> does not provide residual disinfection, so there is a possibility of recontaminating the water through contact with hands during the transfer of the treated water in a safe container.
Care should be taken during this transfer.
Finally, we should notice that the <i>Moringa</i> treatment
[cannot be] 100% effective in removing of pathogens in the water during its treatment.
It's important to consider combining this natural coagulant process with additional steps of water disinfection.
In conclusion, recall that local populations in developing countries struggle to handle their safe water production.
They may even need to use local available materials for filtering, as we've seen in Cameroon, or use <i>Moringa</i> seed powder in water purification, as we saw in Burkina Faso.
However, they still need training and recommendation, in both cases, for safe and sustainable household water treatment.
This water, treated at the household level for drinking purposes, still needs additional disinfecting treatment, as we saw previously.
Some of those steps will be solar disinfection or chlorination.
Additional information on <i>Moringa</i> process details for water purification can be found at the links below.
However, if there are still some questions and queries about one of the case studies presented here,
[inaudible], just let us know through a question in the course's forum, and it will be a pleasure for us to answer it.
Thank you for following us.
