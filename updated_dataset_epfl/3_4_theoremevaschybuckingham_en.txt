During previous module, we have seen the theory of similarity through the example of the pendulum and the question that arose was to know how to do when we have a problem and that we do not know how to solve the equations, how to determine the dimensionless number that characterizes the problem and if possible to find the shape of these dimensionless number. I will bring here a part of the answer which is, via the theorem of
Vaschy-Buckingham also called Pi theorem, it is a part of the answer very formal, the statement of the theorem is useful, the practical application is detailed in every fluid mechanics book but you must know that in a concrete way we never use it under this form here, however, the result of the theorem is very useful.
We are going to see right now what is the form of this statement. The Vaschy-Buckingham theorem states that when we are studying a problem that has n variables that I call here a1 to an, I am translating the fact that there is a relation between these parameters here, either as what we call implicit, where I am expressing here through a function Î¦ that all the parameters are connected, or as an explicit form by taking only one parameter that I am trying to express as a function of all the others.
For example a1 as a function of the parameters a2 to an. These variables are defined in a system where I have m measures that use p fundamental units, in general, in mechanics we work all the time with kg, the meter and the second so we will have in general 3 fundamental units.
The question that arises is to know how many numbers without dimensions or dimensionless do I need to represent the solution of the problem, so if I have the formula like this, I have n physical variables, so if I write the equations under dimensionless form, how many of dimensionless number do I need to simplify this equation ? The answer given by the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem is extremely simple, the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem states that we can form a number k = n - r independent dimensionless numbers. r here is what we will call the rank of the dimensional matrix associated to the problem.
Here, of course, you are getting scared, I recall, what we call the rank of a matrix in linear algebra, the rank of a matrix is the maximal number of vectors of lines or columns that are independent, it is also the dimension of the vector subspace that is generated by these vectors or these columns. If we have for example a matrix
3*3 and that the lines of the equations are independent from each other, the rank will be equal to the dimension. In this case here, we will have r = p = 3. In a couple of cases for example, we can have lines or columns that will be proportional or a column that will be a linear combination of the two other columns, in this case the rank will be inferior to p, it is a case a little more unusual. Very often, in the problems that we must study we will have the rank of the matrix that will be equal to the number of fundamental units so very often r = 3 in the problems of fluid mechanics, but not always. In this case here, the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem states that, if I write here under an explicit form, rather than studying a problem where I have n variables, I will seek to calculate the variable a1 as a function of the 1-other variables, I can obtain a problem that is simpler so I can decrease the degree of freedom of the system by looking for a relation where I have k, dimensionless numbers, typically,
I will be able to write here, for example, a dimensionless number that I call Pi1 as a function of k - 1 other dimensionless numbers.
This Vaschy-Buckingham theorem simplifies, reduces the number of variables of the problem. The proof is relatively simple, I will not go into details, but if you remember a little what we have seen with the Rayleigh method, you must keep in mind that all variables can be written as a product of monomial of fundamental units.
In general in mechanics we will have 3 fundamental units that will be : the length, the mass expressed in kg and the time expressed in seconds. All the variables that I will introduce will be what we call monomials, so will be a product of its fundamental units raised to a power Î±, Î² and Î³. For each of my variables, I will be able to write one of these relations. After, if I am looking to form dimensionless numbers from the problem variables, i.e. that I am looking to write a dimensionless number, if Pi index i as a function of my problem variables, so I am looking to calculate the coefficients k1 to kn such that the physical units here are equal to 0, that the number is dimensionless.
We are brought to solve a system of p equations, so if I write it as a matrix, I have a system to solve where I will have p equations for n unknowns, if the determinant of this system is different of 0, that the matrix is r, then there exists n-r solutions linearly independent, it is the idea of the proof of the Vaschy-
Buckingham theorem. If we had to put into practice this theorem, what we should do, is firstly to isolate the physical quantities, the physical variables of the problem and so to count them, which would give us the number n of physical variables. Then, we would write the dimensions of each of these variables in the fundamental system (kg.m/s) which is in general the one of mechanics. Then, we would determine the rank of the dimensional matrix associated. In general, this result, most of the time we have r = 3 and sometimes r =2.
From there, the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem states that there are n - r dimensionless numbers that can be created. We will see it through an example, if I apply this mathematical method here, we will end up with dimensionless numbers but that do not necessarily have a meaning in physics. What it is important to do, when we proceed this way, is to manage to obtain combinations that have a physical meaning in order not to have a problem purely mathematical. It is the drawback of the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem, if we had to apply it in such a linear way, it is such that we have a formulation very mathematical and we forget the physics that is behind so that in practice we never use it under this form. To see how we use this Vaschy-Buckingham theorem, we take a classical example that is what we call the calculation of the drag force.
The drag force, is my force that is for example exerted by a fluid over a particle that I will assume here spherical and of radius r, this fluid Newtonian, incompressible, that has a viscosity Î¼ and a density
Ï�F will exert, if the velocity of fluid motion of the particles, relative velocity, is different, will exert a force F. This force F is called the drag force. If we look at the problem, we have 5 variables that define the problem, so the force F, it is what we are looking to calculate, the dynamic viscosity of the fluid, its density, the radius of the particle, so the radius or the diameter, regardless, and the relative velocity of displacement of the particle compared to the fluid, so the relative velocity that I call u. We could ask ourselves . "Why aren't we taking into account the density of the particle ?" or other parameters ? So here we must do a bit of physics, we should reason a bit physically but typically, if for example the density is not a parameter that is here pertinent as the force exerted is necessarily independent of what is happening inside, of what constitutes the inside of the particle so it is independent of the density of the particle. We will not retain the density of the particle as a variable. However this force will depend on the geometric dimension of the object and so we will retain the radius of the particle as a problem variable. we see that this search of variables that characterizes the problem is not something as easy as that, we must already start to think about the physics of the phenomenon. Once we have done this exercise of counting the physical quantities, we must move on to something a lot easier which is to transcribe these variables in the system of fundamental units, meters, seconds, kilograms. I have here identified my 5 variables, the force, the relative velocity, the density of the fluid, its dynamic viscosity and the radius of the particle in the international system. I will then apply the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem by searching the dimensionless numbers, by considering that these are monomials, of the variables F, u, Ï±, Î¼, r with an exponent that will be a, b, c, d, e affected to each of these variables. I am looking for an implicit formulation between these 5 variables here, in fact
I am looking at how I must write when
I write this as physical units, how must I write my combination, so what values must I give to a, b, c, d and e ? It is obvious, when we look at the problem that we have three equations, as we have three fundamental physical units, kg, m, s and that we have 5 unknowns, so we find easily, by simple mathematical reasoning the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem, we will be able in fact to have two degrees of freedom as we will be able to determine thanks to these three equations 3 of the 5 unknowns but that there remains two others that will remain free or adjustable. The initial relation, expressed in the physical variables F, u, Ï±, Î¼, r, if I express it under a dimensionless form can be found under a form with only two variables Pi1 and Pi2 that are dimensionless quantities and we see that we go from a problem of dimension 5 to a problem of dimension 2 so we have considerably simplified the theoretical study or the experimental study of the problem. I will assume here, you can do it differently at home and see what it gives but I will assume here that
I take a and d as free variables and
I will determine the others knowing that a and d, I assume that I know these values here. If I proceeded differently, I would obtain other results but as I know here the result from a physical point of view, and to gain time, I assume that a and d are known and have a certain value.
If I solve the system that we have seen previously,
I will be able to obtain b, c and e and I obtain thus the following relations. As a and d are adjustable, there exists an infinity of possible values for b, c and e as a function of a and d. As I have said in notice, we must be careful to find numbers that are dimensionless numbers with a physical meaning, and we must find numbers that are independent numbers.
To find independent numbers, I simply have to take a = 1 and d = 0, which will give me b = -2, c = -1 and e = -2. I could have done another combination a = 2, d = 1 for example, the numbers also were independent. If I do this, I obtain this first dimensionless number which is the ratio of the force divided by Ï±.r^2.u^2, we will see that this number here has a physical significance relatively important. If I continue, to find the second dimensionless number, I take a = 0, d = 1, I could have taken d
= 2 or 3, a = 1, what we notice is in any case the previous combination would make a = 1, d = 0, the actual combination is a = 0, d = 1, these two combinations are well independent. If I take these values here for a and d, I obtain for b, c and e the values -1, -1, -1 and so I obtain a second dimensionless number that in fact looks like the Reynolds number. As every combination of dimensionless numbers is a dimensionless number and that I better work in a dimensionless form of numbers and that have a known physical interpretation, simple, I better take as a dimensionless number, not this ratio here but directly here the Reynolds number. What is now relatively important, what we have shown, is that the calculation problem of the drag force could be simplified to a relation between this parameter Pi1 and this parameter Pi2 which will be here the Reynolds number. This parameter here, has a name, it is what we will call the drag coefficient. Now if I synthesize my result, the initial problem, a problem with 5 variables, I can simply it to a problem in an implicit form, a problem with two variables, or also in an explicit form, still with two variables and this dimensionless number here, is what
I will call here the drag number, so drag coefficient, which is a number with no dimension and which is here function of a dimensionless number which is the Reynolds number. What is useful is that the similarity theorem gives us the number of dimensionless numbers that characterize the problem and also gives us the definition of these numbers here. Of course it cannot determine here the structure of Ï†
To manage to get this value of Ï†, we must either solve the equations of the mechanics, or do experiments to be able to experimentally determine Ï†.
Theoretically, when the Reynolds number is small, the calculations can be done by hand, they are relatively complicated so I simply give the result but what we show is that at very small Reynolds number, the drag coefficient will be equal to 24/Re, it is a law called the Stokes law. What we also show from an experimental point view is that when we are at very large Reynolds number, in general, the drag coefficient tends to a constant, here Ï† as a function of
Re will tend to a value that is between
0,4 and 0,5, it is an experimental value.
If now I draw this or I synthesize what I obtain from an experimental point of view, what we will have is here the drag coefficient as a function of Reynolds number, at small Reynolds number, I have here the Stokes law that states that the drag coefficient is inversely proportional to the Reynolds number and we see that when the Reynolds number increases, it tends to a plateau. At very very large Reynolds number, there are things relatively complexed that occur and it tends here to a value which is between 0,4 and 0,5. Through this example of calculation of the drag force, we have illustrated the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem which is really extremely important to remember is above all the statement of the theorem thus to know that we can reduce the number of variables of the problem and so in general when we have 3 physical variables kg.m/s, we can reduce by 3 the number of parameters that describe the phenomenon, so we will be able to introduce k = m - 3 dimensionless numbers, in general it depends on the problems.
The second point to remember is that the implementation of the Vaschy-Buckingham theorem is relatively complicated, it has its interest from an heuristic point of view, for the learning, in practice, in engineering or in research, we generally proceed in a different way, by non-dimensionalizing directly the equations to avoid this step a little fastidious of dimensional equations solving and above all of searching the right combinations of dimensionless numbers. We will see in the next module to what use it is in practice.
