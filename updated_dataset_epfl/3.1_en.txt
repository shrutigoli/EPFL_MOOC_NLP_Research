All of the sudden the earthquake rocked, we hadn't thought about such things before.
If we had general knowledge about consequences of an earthquake, all of us would have made stronger houses.
If we had such knowledge before, that could have been good.
Now, the people are encouraged to build their house with 2 feet stone walls then erecting wooden planks and metal sheets as walls and roof
This type of cottage house is recommended by the Disaster Management Committee for the moment.
We are advising people not to use stone walls like before.
We are delivering people the message that if such 2 feet wall house with wood and metal sheets will collapse during such natural disaster, they will not crush to death.
Maybe they will be wounded.
Dear Participants,
Welcome to chapter 3 of the MOOC,
<i>A Resilient Future Science and Technology for Disaster Risk Reduction.</i>
This chapter addresses the prevention phase of disaster risk reduction.
The objectives of this chapter include the presentation of the non-structural aspects of prevention from a science and technology perspective, as well as the presentation of examples of technologies and structural measures that could help to prevent and mitigate risks.
This chapter will answer the following questions:
Who are the actors involved in science and technology for DRR?
How are science and technology included in DRR-related governance?
How does knowledge management and land-use planning help in DRR?
What is Eco-DRR?
What are some examples of structural measures?
What are the different risk transfer mechanisms?
We will present these topics with the help of external partners, such as the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and consultants from the private and public sectors.
Welcome to chapter 3.
