Hello and welcome to our
Smart City MOOC.
My name is Matthias Finger, I'm a professor of Management of
Network Industries at EPFL in
Switzerland. 
As you all know, cities are the new relevant entities in the world. 
Economically relevant, socially relevant, ecologically relevant, increasingly politically relevant and, of course, since long, culturally relevant. 
The urban infrastructures are the very backbone of these cities and in the previous MOOC, which you may have seen, we have talked about a series of key topics. 
Namely, first, the distinction between the infrastructures and the services that are being provided on the basis of infrastructures, then we have talked about the performance of urban infrastructure systems. 
And then we have explained the processes of planning, maintaining and operating urban infrastructures. 
We have also briefly mentioned the emerging role of the information and communication technologies. 
Something which has become known as Smart City. 
Now in this MOOC, we will talk about the impact of the information and communication technologies on the urban infrastructures. 
And the important managerial and governments considerations which are necessary to unleash the potential of these ICT's for Smart Cities and we will do that in 5 separate weeks.
In the first week, we will offer an understanding of Smart Cities. then in week 2 and week 3, we will talk about smart urban energy systems and smart urban transportation systems.
Week 4 and 5 are dedicated to the question of transiting towards Smart Cities. 
In order to complete the course, please watch the videos. 
There are also complementary readings that explain the various aspects of the course. 
There are quizzes that have to be taken and at the end of the course there is a final exam. 
You also have the opportunity to write an optional case which gives you the possibility to win a prize. 
I hope you will enjoy the course and stay tuned.
