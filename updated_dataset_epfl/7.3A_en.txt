Welcome to the third and final video of Week
7 of this introductory course on synchrotrons and x-ray free-electron lasers!
In this video, we discuss techniques that probe either photons or electrons resulting after absorption. Specifically, we will discuss the photon-in - photon-out techniques of x-ray fluorescence and RIXS, plus variants of photoelectron spectroscopy, in particular x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, angle-resolved photoelectrons spectroscopy, and hard x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy.
Fluorescence spectroscopies are photon-in
- photon-out techniques and can be carried out on both conducting and insulating samples.
As a result, these techniques can often be applied under ambient or indeed in-vivo environments, depending on the energy range of interest.
X-ray fluorescence generally probes the fluorescence spectrum resulting from absorption at a fixed incident photon energy, although excitation can also be via impact of energetic electrons.
Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering, on the other hand, probes the emission spectra as a function of incident photon energy.
X-ray fluorescence probes the photons emitted as a consequence of relaxation of the system after photoabsorption.
The energy ranges of XRF and XAS are related, insofar that where XRF ends, XAS begins. This is because the emission spectrum probes the highest-energy occupied states, whereas XAS spectra only begin at the lowest-energy unoccupied states.
X-ray fluorescence is a powerful method for determining the chemical composition of objects that are either too thick for transmission-absorption measurements, or are insulating and therefore preclude photoemission techniques. XRF is used widely in geochemistry, archaeology, forensic science, and investigations of rare or ancient artefacts. It exploits the â€˜fingerprintâ€™ characteristic radiation of the elements for chemical and elemental analysis.
In x-ray fluorescence spectromicroscopy, the dispersed XRF signal is mapped out spatially using a focussed beam. This can be performed either using EDX or a von-Hamos spectrometer.
WDX setups, in which the fluorescence energy is serially scanned, are too slow.
XRF signal is strongly absorbed by air for emission below approximately 2500 eV, which corresponds to Sulphur or Chlorine K-alpha emission, or thereabouts. For emission signal below this photon energy, the path to the detector should be evacuated to avoid absorption by the residual gas, such that the product of the sampleâ€“detector distance and pressure is less than approximately 1 Pa m (note that there are 100â€™000 Pa per atmosphere, or
100 Pa per mbar). A sample-detector distance of 10 cm would thus require pressures of the order of 0.1 mbar or lower.
If the XRF spectra are energetically well resolved, requiring either a WDX or von-Hamos setup, subtle peak shifts and splittings can be detected, much as in XANES. For example, the K-alpha lines omitted by 3d-elements, produce two lines, K-alpha-1 and K-alpha-2, caused by spin-orbit splitting of the core
2p-electron energy level. This is still energetically removed from the valence states, the states that are most affected by chemistry, and thus provide little or no chemical information.
In contrast, relaxation from the 3p electron levels (the so-called k-beta lines) ***** exhibit more subtle splittings and shifts, due to the significantly stronger interaction between the 3p-states and the 3d-valence band. If the spectra are recorded with an energy resolution of the order of an eV or better, valuable information of the local oxidation state and chemical bonding can be gleaned.
An example is shown here of x-ray fluorescence microspectroscopy carried out on the famous fossil specimen of archaeopteryx thermopolis at the SSRL in Stanford, recorded with incident energies of 3.15 keV and 13.5 keV for low-Z and high-Z elements, respectively, and a spatial resolution of 100 microns.
Results show that portions of the feathers are not merely impressions, but are in fact remnant body fossil structures, that, remarkably, have maintained elemental compositions that are completely different from the embedding geological matrix, indicating elemental retention in soft tissue (through the presence of phosphorus and sulfur), as well as trace metal (Zn and
Cu) retention in bone structures over many tens of millions of years. In addition, information about the likely fossilisation process (known as â€œtaphonomyâ€�) could be extracted.
Both XRF and x-ray absorption spectroscopy are sensitive to local electronic structure and bonding around the absorbing/emitting atom. When one combines these techniques, further detailed information becomes possible, in the relatively new technique of resonant inelastic x-ray spectroscopy, or RIXS. RIXS has many analogies with Raman spectroscopy in the visible and infrared regime.
The energy difference between the emitted photon and the incident photon can range between some meV and a few eV. This energy loss, plus the momentum transfer and change in polarization between the incoming and outgoing photon is directly associated with the production of an electron-hole pair, induced by one or more important processes related to electronic and superconducting properties, such as phonon, magnon, or low-energy electronic excitations.
Like I just said, RIXS is the marriage of conventional x-ray absorption and x-ray fluorescence in a single experiment. RIXS signal can be directly generated following resonant absorption of a photon by an atom promoting an electron to an unoccupied conduction-band state, followed by relaxation of a lower-lying state to the core, resulting in the formation of an electron-hole pair.
Indirect RIXS signal occurs when absorption and relaxation are between the same two states, but, when the atom is in the excited intermediate state, a strong electrostatic screening potential around the core hole â€˜shakesâ€™ the atom, resulting in the promotion of an electron from the valence- to the conduction band and an energetic rearrangement of the absorbing upper level.
XAS and/or XRF alone cannot probe the electron momenta and can therefore yield no insights into the materialâ€™s electronic bandstructure.
The reason for this is essentially because a core hole is involved â€” in the case of
XAS this hole is in the final state after absorption, while in XRF it is in the initial state. due to the local formation of a hole, this results in a breakdown of the crystalâ€™s translational symmetry at exactly the location where the measurement is being made, which has the consequence that k, the electron momentum, is no longer well defined.
In RIXS, neither the initial or final states contain a core vacancy and thus momentum remains a good quantum number. This makes RIXS an important adjunct to ARPES, described later in this video, as a probe for the electronic bandstructure of a wide variety of materials.
In addition, because RIXS excitations are second-order and involve the virtual absorption of a photon, certain excitations (such as the d âˆ’ d excitation between 3d-states in transition-metal oxides) are allowed, but which are forbidden in direct optical processes.
A unique feature of RIXS is the very large range of energies and momenta that can be transferred to the system under investigation in the inelastic scattering event. This is because photons instead of electrons (used in photoelectron studies) are used as probes.
For a given wavelength lambda (be it the de
Broglie wavelength of the electron or the photon wavelength), or more conveniently, the wavenumber k, which equals 2pi/lambda, and is directly proportional to the momentum, the ratio of the photon- to electron energy is hnu/Ee = hbar c k divided by hbar^2k^2 over 2m, which equals 2 mc/hbar k, or in practical units 517.3/k, where k is expressed in reciprocal
Angstroms. So for typical wavevectors of the order of 1 reciprocal Angstrom, the range of energies and scattering vectors Q available to RIXS surpass other x-ray methods by approximately two orders of magnitude.
One distinguishes two types of energy-loss features in RIXS, according to whether they vary or not as a function of the incident photon energy hbar Î©. Features which are independent of hbar Q appear as vertical lines in a two-dimensional plot of energy transfer versus incident energy, shown here schematically.
They represent electron-hole pair excitations associated with two well-defined states and are therefore products of RIXS processes.
Their analogy in the optical regime are Stokes phonons in Raman spectroscopy, from which they obtain their name of Raman peaks. In contrast, those features which exhibit a constant emission photon energy are called x-ray fluorescence- or emission lines. In the plot of energy transfer versus incident energy, these lines have a gradient of unity.
We turn now to photoelectron spectroscopies.
There are many variants of PES. Ultraviolet and very soft x-rays probe the most weakly bound, valence electrons of a system, and can provide important information on the materialâ€™s electronic band structure, particularly when the electron momentum (that is, itâ€™s emission direction relative to the crystal lattice from which it emerged) is also recorded.
At higher photon energies, core electrons can also be accessed, providing information on the sample chemistry in the technique of x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, originally named electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis, or ESCA.
Scattering phenomena of the photoelectrons as they emerge for the sample surface can provide invaluable structural information of that surface and near-surface region.
Hard x-ray PES, or HAXPES, uses high-energy x-rays, not to access information of the chemistry via excitation of core electrons, but instead to probe the electronic properties of the sample via the valence electrons, similar to the case of ARPES. However, because the photon energy is high and the valence-electron binding energies low, the photoelectron energies will also be high. This brings us towards the high-energy regime of the universal curve, for which the inelastic mean-free path is higher. As a result, HAXPES probes not the surface region, but instead the sampleâ€™s bulk properties, or, indeed, the electronic properties of interfacial regions in thin-film heterostructures.
We begin our discussion of PES with the physical process responsible for the generation of photoelectrons, the photoelectric effect.
This is the phenomenon that electrons can be emitted from the surface of a metal, but only if the wavelength of light used is shorter than a critical value. Light of longer wavelengths than this fail to eject electrons, even if higher beam intensities are used. Although both Heinrich Hertz and JJ Thomson observed aspects of the photoelectric effect, it would take the insights of Albert Einstein to explain it. Einstein invoked the concept of there being a minimum packet of energy associated with light of a frequency nu, and that light consisted of these packets, or quanta, of light, called nowadays photons. This paradigm shift in the description of light as consisting of particles instead of being a wave would earn Einstein a Nobel prize in physics in
The threshold upper wavelength for electron emission, or, more intuitively, the lowest frequency, is associated with the so-called work function. The work function arises because, as an electron originally residing in a state at the top of the valence band is removed from the surface of a material, it is attracted by its positively charged mirror image that is produced by a rearrangement of the surface charge resulting from its departure.
Only at distances of more than about 100 Angstroms does this electrostatic image force become negligible. This image potential is the reason why electricity does not â€˜leakâ€™ out from metals and electrons do not shoot out of kinks in current-carrying wires; so, for typical work functions of 5 eV, one would require electric field strengths of the order of 100
MeV/m to electrostatically remove electrons from metal surfaces.
The energy of the photoelectrons is thus equal to the photon energy minus the electron binding energy and also minus the work function. Both
UPS and XPS in general produce electrons with kinetic energies between a few tens of eV and approximately 1000 eV , for which the
IMFP is less than a nanometer. In the HAXPES regime, the photon energy is generally significantly larger than the binding energy, resulting in electron kinetic energies well in excess of a kiloelectronvolt . In this regime, the electronsâ€™ IMFP is significantly larger, and bulk properties of the sample can be investigated.
The electron kinetic energies are determined using concentric hemispherical analysers, or CHAs. For an electron of energy E_e to exit through the centre of the exit hole of the CHA, the conditions given by the equation here must be met. However, electrons with lower energies will be more deviated by the electric field between the concentric domes, while those of higher energies, less so. By using a larger exit aperture and an area electron detector such as a multichannel plate, a two dimensional plot can be recorded, in which the energy is dispersed in one direction, and angular differences in emission are distinguished in the perpendicular direction. In this manner, large regions of both energy and momentum can be simultaneously recorded, accelerating data acquisition, particularly in the technique of ARPES.
Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (or
UPS) uses photon energies of the order of
10 eV up to approximately 200 eV. In this regime, mainly the valence electrons are probed, as the photon energy is insufficient to eject core electrons other than those in the very lightest elements, which are in any case strongly affected by bonding.
The valence electrons are in general responsible for the electronic properties of materials.
By also recording the direction of the photoelectrons relative to the crystallographic structure of single-crystal samples, a detailed description of the electronic properties can be made.
