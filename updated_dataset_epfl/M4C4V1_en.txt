So why don't we go ahead and end with an exercise that we developed to give you an opportunity to apply some of these concepts to a real world problem. 
So online you'll see that there are two papers that you can choose from.
Go ahead and pick one of the papers that you find the most interesting, read it and then go ahead and answer some of these questions or tasks that we played out. 
The first is for you to identify the implementation problem that's presented in the paper, and if applicable, an implementation strategy that was also presented on that paper.
And next, we actually want you to identify the implementation of such outcomes that was used in testing the strategy or the set of implementation activities that were put in place in the paper, and I want you to go on and describe how the implementation research outcomes are personalized. 
That is to say, how was it defined in the paper, and how was the measure taken in terms of the data collection and approach and the methodology.
As you know, there are many different ways that you can collect data for the same set of implementation research outcomes.
So, lot's of times this decision is based in part by looking at the pros and cons of the data collection methods or the biases that are inherent that data collection method, but it also takes to account the resource and time constraints of the organization that's collecting data
So, what we'd like you to do is suggest alternative ways of collecting data for the same set of implementation research outcomes that's presented in the paper. 
And for all this write-up, we actually want you to limit your write-up to 1500 words. 
We don't want you to exceed
2 pages and if you be so kind to upload it into the dedicated folder that has been provided for the exercise.
So thank you again for participating in module 4, every one of the implementation research or course.
We hope you have enjoyed listening to us.
