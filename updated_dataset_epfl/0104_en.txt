1960: the pedestrian is not king, far from it!
He has to survive in an urban jungle where predators have four wheels and formidable exhausts
Walking, biking, have been trying to rebuild a place in our cities
We call that : soft mobility.
The trips are short in our urban societies.
Many trips are within 3 km
It is a common interest that a maximum of person go walk or bike to free up space, to avoid congestion of roads
<I> ... the phenomenon is unfortunate because instead of allowing the passage </ i>
<I> of 25 or 30 cars during the green time, only </ i>
<I> 15 or 20  can pass</ i>
In the 1950s, while developing major road plans there was the idea that the car is a step forward, that the car is free of the constraints of public transportation, that the car will enable a new quality of life
The car, it's part of man as a jacket as a pair of shoes.
And so we will build large ring roads, sometimes demolishing urban neighborhoods for passing expressways.
By the 1960s, the car starts to be a problem in a number of central districts because they are absolutely everywhere and ultimately, it limits the attractiveness of town centers
And so fairly quickly, since the late 1960s one begins to think about the pedestrianization of city centers
<I> The authorities and residents work together to make the center </ i>
<I> a place where it feels good to live. </ I>
The idea initially is not to remove the car, but simply to ensure that the automobile is not bothersome.
It's the same with the slab districts that were built in the 60s throughout Europe.
These are areas where the flow is separated: so that pedestrians are not hindered by car traffic, we dedicate them their spaces, pedestrian malls, paths.
There are, especially in northern Europe, a series of experiments of car-free neighborhoods.
The idea is that the new inhabitants or the inhabitants of this area agree to have no private vehicle when they move in and mobility is organized around the other means of transport available
Driving is considered increasingly stressful due to the conditions of traffic or parking.
Using public transportation is also for issues related to scheduling or load vehicles.
Walking is, somehow, breaking free of these constraints.
