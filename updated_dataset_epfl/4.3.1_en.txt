Hello everyone.
Today, we'll talk about aerodynamic braking maneuvers.
The idea is we need to generate <i>Î”V</i> - s, or change of the velocity.
Of course, only braking <i>Î”V</i> - s and not propulsion <i>Î”V</i> - s.
By using an atmosphere, the atmosphere of a planet or the satellite of a planet like Titan.
It could be planet Mars, for instance, it could be planet Venus, both have an atmosphere.
Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn, also has an atmosphere.
The idea is to come into the vicinity of the planet and use the high atmosphere of the planet or the satellite to generate the <i>Î”V</i>.
So you save propellant this way because every <i>Î”V</i> -- we will see this in the propulsion section of the course-- every <i>Î”V</i> means the use of propellant.
You try to minimize the use of propellant during a journey in the solar system.
So if you want to come into the vicinity of a planet that has an atmosphere, if you want to come into orbit around the planet, you can use the atmosphere itself to generate a <i>Î”V</i> that will allow, for instance, the aerocapture.
This is the first of the aerodynamic braking maneuvers.
You come into the vicinity of the planet and you have a <i>Î”V</i> generated by the high atmosphere.
Of course, you need to have a thermal shield because there will be an increase in temperature when you get into the atmosphere, you have braking in the gases of the high atmosphere.
Aerocapture means you have enough <i>Î”V</i> to be captured by the planet.
Of course you can, as we know now, be on a hyperbolic trajectory in the vicinity of the planet and if you don't have any <i>Î”V</i>, when you come to the periapsis of this hyperbolic trajectory, you are going to move away and leave the sphere of influence after a while.
And either you generate the <i>Î”V</i>, if you want to come into orbit around the planet, by thrusters, or you can use the high atmosphere to generate the <i>Î”V</i>.
Aerocapture is very touchy because suppose you come a little bit too close to the center of the planet and the high-density layers of the atmosphere, you'll have a <i>Î”V</i> which is more than what you were hoping, and you may have an uncontrolled entry into the planet.
If you are a little bit too high, higher than you were planning, then you may have too small a <i>Î”V</i>, you may not be able to reach a velocity under the escape velocity, you may still, although you'll change the shape of your trajectory, you may still escape the planet.
So, in fact, in practice, aerocapture has never been used.
The second method for aerodynamic braking is aerobraking.
Suppose you are already on an elliptical orbit around the planet, and every pass at the periapsis of your trajectory brings you into the high layers of the atmosphere, then you have aerobraking.
On every orbit, you have a little bit of braking, you reduce the energy of your orbit.
The last method is the aeroentry.
This was used at the end of the Shuttle mission, for instance.
You do a little bit of a braking maneuver from your practically circular orbit outside of the Earth's atmosphere.
You come in on a trajectory, which in this case is elliptical, directly into the Earth's atmosphere.
It was also the case for Soyuz and obviously the case also for the command module of the Apollo program.
When they were coming back from the Moon, they had direct aeroentry into the Earth's atmosphere and then they splashed down into the ocean.
Aerocapture, we've already said a few words about it.
This is a more detailed description of what happens.
This is your spacecraft on a hyperbolic trajectory within the sphere of influence of the planet, here.
You have targeted the parameters of your approach to the planet, mainly the choice of the impact parameter, the infinity that we talked about before.
So that you come here, in the high atmosphere of the planet and you're going to have that <i>Î”V</i> generated by this pass in the high atmosphere of the planet.
<i>Î”V</i>, and again, you have to target everything so that the <i>Î”V</i> is what you were planning to have.
Certainly not more than what you were planning because you may have uncontrolled reentry.
At some point you exit the atmosphere of the planet.
Everything has been planned so you're now on an elliptical orbit around the planet with an apoapsis at this point.
Now you need to do something when you are at this point here because if you don't want to come back in the atmosphere of the planet at the periapsis of your new orbit, you need to increase the energy of the orbit, increase the velocity so that you come on an orbit which, at the periapsis, comes outside of the atmosphere of the planet.
So if you want to do aerocapture, you have the <i>Î”V</i> caused by the pass through the high layers of the atmosphere at the periapsis.
Then, at the apoapsis of your new elliptical orbit round the planet, you need to increase the energy so you don't come back into the atmosphere on the second pass.
Aerobraking, I've already mentioned before.
Here's an illustration of it.
Suppose you're on an elliptical orbit around the planet.
This is the apoapsis, this is the periapsis which is within the atmosphere of the planet which is in pale orange color here.
So if you have several consecutive passes in the high atmosphere of the planet, of course, you will lose energy little by little at every pass at the periapsis through the atmosphere.
So your orbit will decay and the apoapsis will become smaller and smaller.
Of course, you reduce the value of a, the semi-major axis of your orbit and consequently you reduce the energy of your orbit.
At some point, when you're here for instance, you may want again to give a posigrade burn to increase the energy of your orbit so that the next pass at the apoapsis, at the periapsis, sorry, will be outside the atmosphere of the planet, so you can come into an elliptical or circular orbit around the planet.
This is typically the case where the first apoapsis is too high for the circular orbit, so you wait for that decay to take place until you are at the proper height.
And if you want to have a circular orbit around the planet at that altitude, which corresponds here to the apoapsis of your elliptical orbit, then you do a posigrade burn to circularize at this point.
Aeroentry, as mentioned, is the end of a mission or lower orbit for the Shuttle in the past and for Soyuz these days.
After visiting the International Space Station, bringing crews to ISS or bringing back crews to the surface of the Earth.
Of course, in the case of Soyuz, you don't have a splashdown like you have here for the Apollo capsule but you come down on firm ground, with braking with a parachute and retro rockets for the last few meters before impact with the ground.
This is the example of the Apollo command module coming back from a 3Â½ days journey from the Moon.
The velocity of entry of the service module with the three crew members on board in the high atmosphere was very high.
It was of the order of 11 km per second.
It was close to the escape velocity.
So it was a very high velocity, much more than you have if you come back from a lower orbit where typically you come back with a velocity of about 8 km per second.
Apollo was much higher than that.
In fact, it was pretty difficult in planning because the service module, the command module, sorry, had to come for splashdown in the ocean in the vicinity of boats which were prepared to recover the crew and the capsule.
A lot of planning had to take place and the longitude of the impact point on the ocean depended on the timing of the whole trajectory and the latitude depended on the declination of the Moon at the time of the beginning of the return trajectory from the Moon orbit to the Earth.
So the planning was quite tough, but it was successful on every one of the six returns from the Moon, in the Apollo program, from Apollo 11 to Apollo 17.
In fact, it was seven in total because we had Apollo 13 that didn't land on the Moon but of course returned in an aeroentry, as I mentioned.
In fact, the aeroentry in the case of the Apollo program for the command module was in two steps.
You had a first kind of rebound in the atmosphere.
Then you had the final entry.
There was a double entry in the atmosphere.
All of this had been planned and worked perfectly well.
