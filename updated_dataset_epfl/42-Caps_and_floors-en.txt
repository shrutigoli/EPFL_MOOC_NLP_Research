If you have issued the floating rate note and have to pay floating rates you'll want to protect yourself against too high rates.
In this case, you would buy a so called cap.
On the other hand, if you invested in a floating rate note and receive floating rates, you'll want to protect yourself against too low rates.
In this case, you'll want to buy a so called floor.
Caps and floors are like calls and puts and they are related through a parity relation which relates them to the value of a corresponding swap.
We will price caps and floors using the forward measures developed in the previous part.
We will learn about the so called
Black's and Bachelier's price formulas.
Both formula's express caps and floor prices in terms of a single volatility parameter which is in 1-1 relation to these prices.
It is market practice to quote caps and floors in terms of their implied volatilities.
A caplet with reset date <i>T-0</i> and settlement date <i>T-1</i> pays the holder the difference between the simple spot rate and the strike rate <i>Îº.
Specifically, the cash flow at time <i>T-1 is Î´ times the positive part of the difference between the simple spot rate and the strike rate <i>Îº.
Formally, this is as shown here.
We denote by Î´, the length of the time interval <I>(T-0, T-1).
It is clear that the caplet protects the holder against too high rates.
What is the price of this caplet at some spot date <i>t.
Let us do it in 2 steps.
We first observe that the pay off of the caplet at time <i>T-1 is known at time <i>T-0.
We can thus infer the time <i>T-0</i> value of the caplet by simply multiplying the cash flow by the <i>T-1</i> bond price.
We can express the simple spot rate in terms of the <i>T-1</i> bond price and rearranging terms brings us to this identity as shown here.
Notice that this is factor times the pay off of a put option on the <i>T-1</i> bond with expiry date <i>T-0</i> and strike price over 1 + Î´Îº.
This is the value at time <i>T-0.
The time <i>t</i> price of the caplet therefore is the price of this put times the factor 1 + Î´Îº.
We denote the price of the caplet like this.
A cap is a strip of caplets.
It is specified by a sequence of reset and settlement dates
<i>T-0</i> up to <i>T-n</i>.
Here <i>T-0</i> is the first reset date and <i>T-n</i> is called the maturity of the cap.
It is further specified by a cap rate Îº and for simplicity of notation we assume that the length of these intervals is equal to Î´.
At the first reset date <i>T-0</i>, we reset the first caplet which yields a cash flow at time <i>T-1.
Same then at <i>T-1</i>, we reset the cash flow of a caplet that pays at <i>T-2</i>, and so on and so forth.
These payments are random and can sometimes be 0.
By linearity of prices the cap price at the spot date <i>t is given by the sum of the prices of the corresponding caplets.
A floor is the converse to a cap.
It protects the holder against low interest rates.
It is defined as a strip of floorlets with cash flows at time <i>T-i given by the positive part of the difference of the strike rate Îº minus the prevailing simple spot rate.
Again at the first reset date <i>T-0</i>, there we set the first floorlet which yields a cash flow at time <i>T-1 and so on and so forth.
Again these cash flows can be positive or 0 depending on whether the prevailing simple spot rate lies above or below the strike rate Îº.
By the linearity of prices, the price of the floor at the spot date <i>t</i>  is given by the sum of the 
Let us observe the following parity relation which holds for the difference for the caplet minus the floorlet pay off.
It is simply equal to the cash flow of a prayer swap.
This proves the following parity relation
Here is the cap, floor, parity relation.
The price of the cap minus the price of the floor is equal to the value of a payer swap with fixed rate, notional 1 and the same reset and settlement date as the cap an the floor.
We then say that the cap and the floor are at the money if their values are the same.
This happens exactly when the strike rate Îº is equal to the prevailing swap rate which renders the value of the payer swap equal to 0.
The cap is then said to be in the money if the strike rate is smaller than the swap rate and out of the money if the strike rate is larger than the swap rate.
For the floor, it's just the converse.
We now derive 2 price formulas for caps and floors.
We start with Black's formula.
Let us first look at these generic price formulas.
We know that the present value of a cash flow that takes place at time <i>T-i</i> is computed by taking the expectation of the pay off under the <i>T-i</i> forward measure and multiplied by the prevailing
<i>T-i</i> bond price.
So in order to compute caplet and floorlet prices we need to know the distribution of this future simple spot rate under the <i>T-i</i> forward measure.
Black's formula assumes that this distribution is log-normal.
More specifically it is assumed that the forward rate process follows these dynamics with the constant Ïƒ.
Recall that we know that the forward rate process is a martingale under the <i>T-i</i> forward measure.
So Black's formula simply assumes that this martingale has very specific dynamics.
This one.
Under this log-normality assumptions we know how to compute these expectations.
This is bringing us to the following theorem.
Black's formula for the <i>i</i>th caplet and floorlet price is as shown here.
Where the ingredients are Î¦ which stands for the standard normal cumulative distributive function and the parameters <i>d-1</i> and <i>d-2</i> which are expressed in terms of Ïƒ.
This is the single volatility parameter in Black's formula and hence is called, the
Black volatility. it is also called the relative volatility alternatively.
Recall that the cap is a strip of caplets and the price of the cap is the sum of the caplet prices.
So it is important to know that the Black volatility for the cap price has to be one and the same for all the caplets that belong to the cap.
The same holds for the floor.
Bachelier's formula assumes that the future simple spot rate is normally distributed under the
<i>T-i</i> forward measure.
More specifically it is assumed that the forward rate process follows a Gaussian process with a constant volatility Ïƒ under the <i>T-i</i> forward measure.
This brings us to the next theorem.
Bachelier's formula for the <i>i</i>th caplet and floorlet price is as shown here.
Where the ingredients are Î¦ the standard cumulative normal distribution function,
Ï† is the density, and <i>D</i> is the parameter shown here.
Again this is expressed in terms of the single volatility parameter Ïƒ which is called the normal volatility.
Alternatively it is also called the basis point volatility or the absolute volatility.
Again as it was the case for the
Black's formula, the normal volatility is going to be the same for all caplets belonging to a cap and similarly for the floor.
With this convention, there is a 1-1 relation between the Black and the normal volatilities and the cap and floor prices.
It is market practice to quote cap and floor prices in terms of their implied Black or normal volatilities.
Caps and floors are typically traded on 3 months simple spot rates in the US market and on 6 months simple spot rates in the Euro market.
Here is an example.
These are at the money cap prices in the Euro-zone from August 2013.
We see that maturities range up to 30 years.
The first column gives us the cap prices in percentage points.
The second column shows the Black implied volatilities and the third column shows us the normal implied volatilities.
Notice that the normal implied volatilities are of an order 100th factor
100 smaller than the Black implied volatilities.
The plot on the right hand side shows the implied volatilities as functions of the maturity of the underlying cap.
It is a challenge for any interest rate model to match these given volatility curves.
