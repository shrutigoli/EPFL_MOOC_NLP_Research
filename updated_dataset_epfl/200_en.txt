Hello.
This lecture deals with the material properties and with the principles of dimensioning of structures.
The content of the session will be as follows: we will first talk about springs, which will enable us to study elasticity, linearity, reversibility and the concept of stiffness, then we will talk about the principle of stress and deformation applied to common construction materials and we will introduce the concept of modulus of elasticity.
Then, we will talk about the usual construction materials which are steel, concrete, timber and glass. 
We will see their main properties, particularly their strengths, their moduli of elasticity and their modes of failure. 
In this context, we will talk about ductility and fragility.
Then, we will deal with the dimensioning of the structures, for which we will explain the principles of dimensioning to guarantee as well the safety of people as a satisfactory usage of the structure, in particular with regard to its deflections.
Then, we will deal with the example of an elevator, as it is a simple example, which is accessible with the tools we have already seen within the framework of this course and for which we will see how to choose the diameter of the main cable, to guarantee the safety of people and also a good comfort, that is to say that the elevator should stop at the required level.
Finally, we will have a few examples and exercises which will conclude this lecture.
I now invite you to begin with the first video of this lecture which deals with springs and elasticity.
