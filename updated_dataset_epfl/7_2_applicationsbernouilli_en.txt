During the second module, we will see three basic applications of Bernoulli's principle. We begin with Torricelli's law, which calculates the draining velocity of a tank. We will then see von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n's formula which calculates the velocity of the motion of a heavy gas through a lighter gas. We will finish with the Pitot tube that calculates for example the velocity of an airplane in the atmosphere.
So let's consider the following problem: we have a tank of diameter d, filled with water until a certain height h, and with a hole at the bottom, here or here. This tank has a hole that has a small diameter d, so d will be very small compared to the diameter of the tank.
We are essentially interested by calculating the velocity here, namely draining velocity, of the water through the small hole. The formula that we will obtain is called Torricelli's law, as it is Evangelista Torricelli who, in the middle of the seventeenth century, highligthed it experimentally. We had to wait nearly a century to get a theoretical analysis of the phenomenon, and it is due to the Swiss mathematician and physician, Daniel
Bernoulli. We will for that apply 
Bernoulli's principle, and I recall that Bernoulli's principle is applicable if the medium is incompressible, in permanent regime, and if we can find a streamline for which we can determine the gravity potential, the kinetic energy and the pressure. So we will consider a fictitious streamline by taking for example here, a point A, and we assume that we have a streamline that connects the point
A to the point B situated at the outlet of the tank. Right after the hole a jet is formed, if we look at the equations of momentum conservation, we will have, as we have an inviscid fluid, we will have a velocity profile uniform through the jet. We are in steady state, we will thus have that the pressure gradient must be zero, so the pressure is constant through the jet section, which means here that we will have all along here this segment we will have the pressure that will be the atmospheric pressure. The velocity too will be constant, it will be equal to the velocity at point B, everywhere we will have the same velocity, and it is in fact the quantity that we are looking to calculate. The velocity here at point A is not known, however we know the initial position, equal to h, and we also know that the atmospheric pressure is applied at point A. To be able to go a little further, we will do an approximation. We must assume, we are in a steady state, we will assume that the draining velocity is extremely small such that here the height will be roughly constant, at least over a time sufficiently long. For this we can use, to justify this approximation, we can use the equation of mass conservation, what we will show here is that the volume flow rate here must be equal to the volume flow rate here.
So this volume flow rate is written as a surface area multiplied by a velocity. So the surface area which is here, multiplied by the velocity at point A and the volume flow here that will be equal to the section multiplied by the velocity. All the same, the diameter of the hole is very small compared to the diameter of the tank, what we obtain is that the velocity at point A must be very small, compared to the velocity at point B, velocity v, that we are trying to determine. So in first approximation, what we will assume is that vA is negligible compared to vB and we are a steady state. If now I look at the three terms that constituted what I called previously, the quantity 
Î¨. So at point A, I assume that the velocity is negligible, i.e. zero. The gravity potential, as I am situated at a height h with respect to a reference point that will be here, the gravity potential is equal to gh, and the pressure is equal to the atmospheric pressure.
At point B, so at the outlet, the velocity, it is what I am trying to calculate, the gravity potential is zero if my reference point is here, and again we have the pressure that is equal to the atmospheric pressure.
So all we know is that the quantity
Î¨, which is equal to the gravity potential
+ the kinetic energy + the pressure, at
A, is thus only equal to Ï±gh, at point
B it will be equal to (1/2)Ï±vÂ². The identity here allows us to calculate directly the draining velocity which is equal here to âˆš(2gh).
The second application of Bernoulli's principle will concern what we call gravity current intrusion, i.e. the motion of a heavy gas through a lighter gas. So, there are many examples of such gravity current : for example in seabeds we can have like here avalanches of sediments, so the mixture water sediment will be here equivalent to a heavy fluid that propagates through a lighter fluid. This photograph, in laboratory, reminds aerosol avalanches in mountains. Another example taken from military applications, when we use a battle gas, so that will be a heavy gas, and that will propagate in the atmosphere, the ambient fluid will be the light fluid. What will interest us here is to calculate the propagation velocity of this front. So we will see that we will be able to calculate the intrusion velocity, the motion velocity of the front, as a function of the density difference between the ambient fluid, the light fluid, and the fluid that is here that will be a water flow. So to simplify the study we not place ourselves on a slope, we will assume we have a ground here that will be horizontal, we have the ambient fluid of density
Ï�â‚�, and here we have the water flow. We will assume that the two fluids do not mix, which is not the case of what is represented on this image where we have vortices and a mixture, so we will assume that we will have an interface well defined between the ambient medium and the heavy gas. So the heavy gas has a density
Ï�, we also assume that this flow is moving at a constant velocity u.
If I now place myself in a frame of reference that is attached to the gravity current, so for example a frame of reference centered at point 0, in this case here, the density current is still, and it is the ambient fluid that had a motion at the velocity -u. To be able to apply Bernoulli's principle I still need to determine a streamline, so I will take as a streamline the free surface, or interface.
So the interface associates two particularities that will have conditions slightly different depending on whether we are situated beside the ambient medium, here the point B, or thst we are situated beside the heavy fluid, here point A. Among other things, through the interface which is extremely thin, we will go here from a density Ï± to a density
Ï±â‚�  with a really small thickness. The point
O, as we are in a frame that is attached to the gravity current, so the point O will be what we call a stagnation point, its velocity will be zero. So if I sum up now all my hypotheses, I thus have a streamline between O and the point A, in fact the point A is a double point : we have a point A situated under the interface, and a point B situated above the interface, there is thus between these two points a jump of density, we go from a density Ï± in A to a density
Ï±â‚� in point B. However we will assume that there are no velocity variation nor pressure variation. Therefore what we will write is that the velocity at point B is equal to the velocity at point A, and is equal thus to the velocity of the ambient fluid
: -u. We also assume that we have a streamline, that is established between the point O and this double point AB. O is thus a stagnation point in the moving frame of reference attached to the gravity current so the velocity at point O is zero. I also assume that there is a distribution of hydrostatic pressure within my density current as the height difference between the point O and the point A is equal to h, the pressure in O is equal to the pressure in A +Ï±gh.
Bernoulli's principle hence applied for the streamline in O between O and B allows me to write the following identity: so that the pressure in point O + the gravity potential at point O + the kinetic energy at point O is equal to the pressure at point
B, its gravity potential, and its kinetic energy. Taking into account of all our hypotheses, so as the pressure at point
O, we have determined it equal to Pð�‘¨
+ Ï±gh, I will be able here to remove the atmospheric pressure that appears. The gravity potential in O as it is the origin point of the frame is zero, and we have seen that it is a stagnation point so the velocity of point O is zero. On the other side, after having removed the atmospheric pressure, all that remains is the gravity potential, we will be careful that it is applied at point B, of density
Ï±â‚�, and that the velocity of point
B is also equal to Ï±â‚�. So when we simplify this equation here, what we obtain is the following relation, that states that u is equal to the square root of 2 times the difference of density between the heavy gas and the light gas divided by the density of the light gas multiplied by gh. We find something that looks a little like Torricelli's law, except that now, we have the âˆš(2gh), except that now it is weighted here by a factor of co-action which is (Ï±-Ï±â‚�)/Ï±â‚�, the product here g multiplied (Ï±-Ï±â‚�)/Ï±â‚� is called the reduced gravity. Written differently, this equation here states that the
Froude number at the front level is equal to a constant, and that this constant is equal to âˆš2. Hence we must note that this application of Bernoulli's principle was subjected to controversy. It is due to to von KÃ¡rmÃ¡n in 1940, at the time it was essentially to know if the use of battle gases by the Germans could thus bring gases that were moving, finally gas motions that could move at great velocity.
So the calculation estimates the velocity of displacement of these battle gases. 30 years later, the calculation has shown that in fact the conditions that are given by this interface theorem are inaccurate and we must apply the momentum conservation on control volumes, of which the exact calculation is much more complete, but finally we obtain the the same results, among other things so, what we had with a surrounding fluid that is infinitely large, the Froude number at the front level is constant and equal to âˆš2.
The third application concerns the Pitot tube. So the Pitot tube is a measuring device used relatively frequently when we want to measure for example the velocity in a water flow. It is also used in the airplanes to measure the displacement velocity of a plane. So the Pitot tube is composed of a tube that we place in parallel of the velocity field. So here we must imagine that we have initially velocities that are propagating in this direction here, so we place the tube, or the tube's axis, parallel to the velocity field. The tube is provided here with a small hole, which leads to a cylinder, that leads to the apparatus that is used to measure the total pressure. We have a second small pipe that is placed laterally, so here the point C, that measures the static pressure, as we are assuming that the velocity goes through like this, and so that there are no fluids entering, so we do not have velocity components here, through the point C. We consider a streamline between A and B. As we are at the same height, we will have a gravity potential that is identical. Moreover, as once the fluid has penetrated here in this space here, we will not be able to have a fluid, the fluid being incompressible, so the point B will be what we call a stagnation point. The fluid's velocity will be zero at point B. So if we apply now
Bernoulli's principle between the point
A and the point B, we will have in A the pressure
+ the kinetic energy + the gravity potential, that must be equal to the pressure at point
B + velocity at point B + gravity potential which is strictly equal to the gravity potential at point A. So when we equalize the two terms that are here, what we have is that the velocity at point A, that we also call vâˆž is equal to (2/Ï±)*(pÊ™-pð��´). Thus furthermore if we assume that the diameter of the Pitot tube is identical, as at point
C there are no fluids penetrating, the velocity staying in this direction here, if we also place a tube connected to a pressure measure, what we will measure here will be a static pressure. If the height difference between C and A is relatively small, so if the tube is relatively slender, the pressure that we will measure in C will be strictly equal to the static pressure at point A, so we have Pð��´ =Pc. So by measuring in parallel here the static pressure, by doing the pressure difference between the two, we can calculate the displacement velocity of the fluid with respect to the Pitot tube. We will now see another application that does transitions between this part of the course, with these three examples relatively simple, and the part dedicated to hydraulics with free surface. What we will study here is the water flow, so for example in a river or in a channel, above an obstacle of small dimension. I place myself as previously in the case of a steady state. So the water is flowing is this direction here, we have here at the upstream a height hâ‚€, and we have a certain average velocity that I call uâ‚€. The size of the obstacle is denoted zð�—†, and I also provide my sketch here, I provide this sketch with a frame Oz, by placing my frame of reference at point
O that is here. What is essentially interesting me is to characterize what is going on here, so the height as a function of position, knowing what is going on upstream, so i.e. by knowing the velocity uâ‚€ and the height hâ‚€, so i.e. by knowing the Froude number that is situated here at the upstream that I call Fâ‚€. So we will proceed a little differently this time , we will write Bernoulli's principle under a differential form. Along a streamline we know that we must have conservation of the quantity kinetic energy 
+ pressure + gravity potential. I have here divided all the terms by Ï±g, so if I differentiate this with respect to x, I must have 0. Moreover I assume that I have conservation of the flow rate, the flow rate per unit width is equal to hu, this flow rate also is constant in steady state, so if I differentiate hu I must have 0, which means that in every slice here I must have the velocity multiplied by the height tat is equal to the flow rate per unit width at the upstream, i.e. uâ‚€hâ‚€. So by using Bernoulli's principle, so we can say that at any point we must have kinetic energy + pressure
+ gravity potential which is equal to what is happening at the upstream. After a few mathematical manipulations, what we can show by differentiating the term, is that we thus have this equation here, that links the depth variation of water or the height of water, as a function of the variation of the bottom bed z. And so the term that is here weighted by a term, and we see appearing here (uÂ²/gh) which nothing else but the Froude number squared. So this equation I can re-write it and I try to draw some consequences. First of all what we note is that if I am approaching the ridge of the obstacle, at the level of the ridge we admit that we have a horizontal tangent, so this term here is equal to 0. So in this case here it means that we either dh/dx that is equal to 0, so in this case here we must also have a horizontal tangent for the free surface, or else we have this term here which is equal to 0, so i.e. that the Froude number square must be equal to 1, so the Froude number must be equal to 1. We also note that every time we will have here the Froude number equal to 1, even if dh/dx is positive or negative, we will have dz/dx that is zero, so every time that the Froude number is equal to 1, we must have a topography that admits a horizontal tangent. What we can also show though this equation is that if initially, at the upstram, the flow is subcritical, so if the Froude number is lower than 1, it will remain all along subcritical. We cannot have passage of a flow here, with this case relatively simple, passage of a subcritical flow to a supercritical flow. Conversely if at the upstream the flow is supercritical, so with a Froude number greater than 1, it will remain all along supercritical.
So we see that there is a condition on the height of the obstacle for this later statement to be true, we show that this maximum height is associated with a
Froude number equal to 1 at the level of the obstacle, and that gives us in this case here the expression of the maximum height as a function of the Froude number. In the case where the height of the obstacle is greater than this maximum height, we will have solutions that are much more complicated, we will have among other things no continuous solutions, we will have a continuous variation of the height and a discontinuous solution, we will see during the final module, that this discontinuous solution is called a hydraulic jump. There, at the end of this second module we have seen some relatively basic applications of Bernoulli's principle, and we have seen an example already a little more complex as a warm-up before tackling the part dedicated to hydraulics with free surfaces.
