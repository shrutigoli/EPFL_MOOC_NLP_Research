My name is Duccio Testa, and in this lecture we will be discussing plasma waves in the ideal MHD model.
We will start with the general formulation for the ideal MHD waves and then, we will study the three classes of waves that are supported by the ideal MHD description of the plasma: the shear AlfvÃ©n waves, the fast compressional AlfvÃ©n waves, and the slow magneto-sonic waves.
To obtain the general formulation of ideal MHD waves, we start from the ideal MHD equations.
Then we add a small perturbation to a uniform and static equilibrium, we linearize the original system of equations around the equilibrium, we apply Fourier transform, and then we obtain the wave dispersion relation.
We start from the ideal MHD equations and we use them to eliminate j and E.
We have here AmpÃ¨re's law and the momentum balance equation.
We can take j from AmpÃ¨re's law and plug it into the momentum balance equation.
With this procedure, we eliminate j.
So what we obtain is that Ï�M(dV/dt) is equal to -âˆ‡p +1/Î¼0
[times] the curl of B Ã— B.
We have then Faraday's law and the ideal Ohm's law.
We can take the electric field from the ideal Ohm's law and put it into Faraday's law.
So what we have: âˆ‚B/âˆ‚t equals the curl of (V Ã— B).
We then have the continuity of the plasma mass and the equation of state.
We can then consider a uniform and static MHD equilibrium, to which we add a small perturbation.
The magnetic field, with an equilibrium term B0, plus its perturbation B1, for the fluid velocity V, since we consider a static equilibrium, the equilibrium term is zero.
We only have the perturbation: V1.
For the mass density, the equilibrium term is a constant, perturbation Ï�M1, and the same for the pressure. p0 is a constant.
We can then linearize the initial system of equations around the equilibrium.
What we obtain is that âˆ‚B1/âˆ‚t is equal to the curl of (V1 Ã— B0).
Perturbation, perturbation first order.
We do the same for the continuity equation: âˆ‚Ï�M1/âˆ‚t + Ï�M0
[times] the divergence of V1 = 0.
The momentum balance equation:
Ï�M0 dV1/dt
= -âˆ‡p1 + 1/Î¼0
[times] (âˆ‡ Ã— B1) Ã— B0.
Then we have the perturbed pressure: p1 = Î³ (p0/Ï�M0) Ï�M1 â€”
The perturbed mass density.
This factor appears in the last equation:
Î³ (p0/Ï�M0) is the sound speed, csÂ² â€” sound speed, cs = (Î³ p0/Ï�M0)^(1/2).
So the perturbed pressure, p1, equals the sound speed squared, csÂ² times the perturbed mass density Ï�M1.
Now we can apply Fourier transform in space and time to linearized equations.
Our first equations become -Ï‰BÌƒ1 â€” the tilde indicates that we are now in Fourier space â€” k Ã— (á¹¼1 Ã— B0).
For the mass density we have -Ï‰ Ï�ÌƒM1
+ Ï�M0 (k â€¢ á¹¼1) = 0.
We have then, for the momentum balance equation,
-Ï‰ Ï�M0 á¹¼1
= -k csÂ² Ï�ÌƒM1
+ (1/Î¼0) (k Ã— BÌƒ1) Ã— B0.
Finally, for the perturbed pressure: pÌƒ1 = csÂ² Ï�ÌƒM1.
We can now chose our geometry for the waves.
Without loss of generality, we can take the equilibrium magnetic field to be along the z-axis and take the k vector in the xz-plane.
We now have two cases.
The first case is the case of transverse waves, where V1 is perpendicular to k.
This case is depicted here.
It is here, the equilibrium magnetic field B0 along the z-axis, the vector k in the xz-plane, and there is an angle, Î¸, between k and B0.
The perturbed velocity: V1 in the y direction perpendicular to k.
The second case is waves with a longitudinal component where V1 is also in the xz-plane, which is depicted in this second figure here.
Let's look at transverse waves.
V1 [is] only along the y direction, and therefore V1 is perpendicular to k, because k is in the xz-plane.
We can now start with the equation in Fourier space for the perturbed mass density.
Perturbed mass density: Ï�ÌƒM1
= 1/Ï‰ Ï�M0 k â€¢ á¹¼1.
But k and V are perpendicular to each other.
Therefore, k and á¹¼ are also perpendicular to each other.
So Ï�ÌƒM1 = 0.
There is no perturbed mass density.
Transverse waves are non-compressional.
We then have two remaining equations that link BÌƒ1y and á¹¼1y.
So we end up with these two equations:
Ï‰ Ï�M0 á¹¼1y + kz B0/Î¼0
[times] BÌƒ1y and the second equation: kz B0 á¹¼1y
+ Ï‰ BÌƒ1y = 0.
We can then combine these two linearized equations into a matricial form.
Now we want to obtain a nontrivial solution which has BÌƒ1y and á¹¼1y, both not equal to zero.
We obtain this solution by taking the determinant of this two-by-two matrix to be equal to zero.
This leads to the dispersion relation for the shear AlfvÃ©n wave.
In this dispersion relation, there is a term that is very important.
This quantity here, B0Â²/(Î¼0 Ï�M0), this is the square of the AlfvÃ©n speed, cA.
We can then cast this dispersion relation in a way that we see the AlfvÃ©n speed and the angle between k and the equilibrium magnetic field.
This is the final form for the dispersion relation of the shear AlfvÃ©n wave:
Ï‰Â² = kÂ² cAÂ² cosÂ²Î¸.
We can now summarize what we have found for the shear AlfvÃ©n wave.
The shear AlfvÃ©n waves are transverse waves.
The perturbed velocity V1 is perpendicular to k and to the equilibrium magnetic field, B0.
The shear AlfvÃ©n wave is noncompressional.
The perturbed mass density, Ï�M1 = 0.
The dispersion relation can be cast in a form:
Ï‰Â² = (k cA)Â² cosÂ²Î¸.
To give you a bit of a heads-up of topics that we will discuss later in this course, the shear AlfvÃ©n wave is important in DT fusion plasma because the velocity of fusion-born Î± particles whose energy at birth is 3.5MeV is super-AlfvÃ©nic: exceeds the AlfvÃ©n speed cA.
Therefore, Î±'s become resonant with shear AlfvÃ©n waves during their slowing down.
Shear AlfvÃ©n waves are ubiquitous in plasma, and in fact they were observed first in space and then in mercury plasmas.
Let's look at ideal MHD waves with a longitudinal component.
V1 now has an x and z component, so k â€¢ V1 â‰  0.
We can repeat all the previous calculations to obtain an expression for the perturbed magnetic field:
B1 = (V1x B0/Ï‰) k Ã— ey.
We can continue the analysis, and we obtain a dispersion relation for the ideal MHD waves with a longitudinal component.
Ï‰â�´ - Ï‰Â² kÂ² (cAÂ² + csÂ²) + kÂ² kzÂ² cAÂ² csÂ² = 0
This is our dispersion relation for ideal MHD waves with a longitudinal component.
We see that [we have] a term, that depends on the AlfvÃ©n speed cA and on the sound speed cs and it's in fact a quadratic relation for Ï‰Â².
We can solve this equation rather easily.
So we immediately see that there are two roots of this dispersion relation for Ï‰Â².
We have a root with the plus and a root with the minus.
We can simplify this dispersion relation because the ratio between the sound speed cs and the AlfvÃ©n speed cA, squared, is usually much smaller than one in typical plasma conditions.
So we can take only terms that are first-order in the ratio between csÂ² and cAÂ².
So we end up with this formulation for the dispersion relation, Ï‰Â²,
1/2 kÂ² cAÂ²
(1 +csÂ²/cAÂ²), so a first [order] correction in cs,
1 Â± the two roots for Ï‰Â²,
(1 - (2kzÂ² csÂ²)/(kÂ² cAÂ²)).
We can now consider the plus root of the dispersion relation.
We can now proceed with this calculation by summing 1 and the brackets.
We can now take the product between the two brackets and keep only the terms that are linear in the ratio (cs/cA)Â².
Now we know kz = k cos Î¸, we can then recast this last term.
So this is the final dispersion relation for the plus root of the dispersion relation of [the] ideal MHD wave with a longitudinal component.
We call this wave the fast compressional AlfvÃ©n wave.
We've seen that it's compressional â€” k â€¢ V(1) â‰  0 â€” and it is the fast solution because the phase velocity is cA â€” the AlfvÃ©n speed, that is much larger than cs, the sound speed.
We see the dispersion relation is simply
Ï‰â‚ŠÂ² = kÂ² cAÂ² and that the sound speed and the angle between the k vector and the equilibrium magnetic field only enters as a small correction.
We have worked through the fast wave solution, the plus solution.
Now we can take the minus solution.
This will lead us to the slow wave.
We've taken the minus solution here.
We can now work through the algebra.
The 1 - 1 term cancels out, so we only remain with 2 kzÂ² csÂ²
/(kÂ² cAÂ²). simplifies out.
So what we end up with:
Ï‰â‚‹Â² = kzÂ² csÂ² and this is why we call this wave the slow wave, because the phase velocity is cs.
That is much smaller than cA.
The wave frequency depends on the sound speed and the angle between the k vector and the equilibrium magnetic field.
So we call this the slow magnetosonic wave â€” a sound wave that exists in the presence of a magnetic field.
A very useful way to represent the solution of the wave dispersion relation for ideal MHD is the surface described by the phase velocity vector Ï‰ k /kÂ².
We have here on the left the case for the shear AlfvÃ©n wave, which is noncompressional, the dispersion relation, Ï‰Â²
= (k cA)Â² cosÂ² Î¸.
So if we draw this curve, what we see is that we obtain an eight along the axis of the magnetic field and the effective radius of this eight is cA cos Î¸ .
In the second case, we have the dispersion relation for waves which have a longitudinal component.
We have an inner figure that is again another eight.
This corresponds to the slow magnetosonic wave for which the dispersion relation is Ï‰Â² = (k cs)Â² cosÂ² Î¸.
The radius is (cs cosÎ¸), so it's much smaller than (cA cosÎ¸).
The outer circle corresponds to the fast compressional AlfvÃ©n waves, for which the dispersion relation is Ï‰Â² = kÂ² cAÂ² when we neglect all correction due to the sound speed.
This is a circle whose radius is cA.
We can now summarize what we have discussed on ideal MHD waves.
The first wave that we discussed
[is the] transverse wave.
This is a noncompressional wave, the shear AlfvÃ©n wave.
This wave will be discussed in the concept of burning plasmas.
Then we have discussed compressional waves which have a longitudinal component, and we found two solutions: the fast compressional AlfvÃ©n wave and the slow magnetosonic wave.
