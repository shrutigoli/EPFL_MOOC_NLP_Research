1
00:00:09,249 --> 00:00:14,659
The Nazinga Game Range is located
in the south of Burkina Faso

2
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,114
two hundred kilometers
from the capital city

3
00:00:19,214 --> 00:00:20,533
which is Ouagodougou.

4
00:00:20,733 --> 00:00:25,959
The Nazinga covers
around nine hundred square kilometers

5
00:00:26,059 --> 00:00:30,684
and these entirely are made
of savanna.

6
00:00:30,784 --> 00:00:39,378
The range's main management targets
are the conservation of biodiversity

7
00:00:39,478 --> 00:00:43,945
and the valorisation
of natural resources

8
00:00:44,045 --> 00:00:48,963
through hunting and tourism.

9
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:51,267
I mean, vision tourism.

10
00:00:51,726 --> 00:00:59,209
Because of this, the park falls
under the protected area

11
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,731
of category six.

12
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:09,301
Population growth
in the many surrounding villages

13
00:01:09,501 --> 00:01:15,721
is one of the greatest threats
faced by the range.

14
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:26,883
This causes poaching, and creates
the need for agricultural space

15
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:31,944
which greatly impacts fauna
and flora.

16
00:01:32,650 --> 00:01:38,780
Despite this contraint,
and with the aim

17
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:46,808
of reaching all its targets in mind,
the range has implemented

18
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:51,572
a continuous ecological
monitoring system

19
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:56,090
of some values
of the ecosystem.

20
00:01:57,066 --> 00:02:08,082
So, in Nazinga, the climate is monitored
to know the state of the environment

21
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:13,476
and the factors that can affect it.

22
00:02:14,048 --> 00:02:19,922
To give an example, making
the right decision

23
00:02:20,022 --> 00:02:27,568
regarding bush fires ignition,
including preferred date 

24
00:02:27,768 --> 00:02:31,087
or time of fire to set,

25
00:02:31,187 --> 00:02:37,642
which are key elements
in this savanna's ecosystem

26
00:02:39,119 --> 00:02:49,634
as it will help management
to have knowledge on the influence

27
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:56,834
of the quality of pasture available
for the park herbivores

28
00:02:56,888 --> 00:03:02,595
who are also monitored
and valued in the range.

29
00:03:05,069 --> 00:03:13,251
Climatic factors are monitored
through the weather station located

30
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:19,155
in the range, as well as
another station located

31
00:03:19,355 --> 00:03:23,495
in Po City, near 
the protected area.

32
00:03:23,695 --> 00:03:29,144
And more recently, via 
another station set up

33
00:03:29,274 --> 00:03:34,462
by some program, research program,
called WASCAL,

34
00:03:34,662 --> 00:03:40,634
which is studying climate changes
in the area.

35
00:03:41,982 --> 00:03:46,321
Monitoring water points
is also considered

36
00:03:46,521 --> 00:03:49,741
when monitoring certain habitats.

37
00:03:49,941 --> 00:03:56,408
This type of monitoring aims
at controlling the presence

38
00:03:56,783 --> 00:04:03,365
of surface water over time
to know its availability

39
00:04:03,465 --> 00:04:08,090
for the park's animal species,
especially elephants,

40
00:04:08,492 --> 00:04:12,302
which are also one
of the range's values

41
00:04:13,202 --> 00:04:21,336
To do this, the water level progression
of the main dams

42
00:04:21,424 --> 00:04:26,841
and water courses is assessed
every season 

43
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:29,342
through direct observations.

44
00:04:30,167 --> 00:04:39,078
If water runs out, the decision
may be made to fill it up

45
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:45,214
artificially to avoid animals
dispersing outside the park.

46
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:51,642
The fauna dynamics
are also monitored

47
00:04:52,379 --> 00:05:02,584
to set collection limits, especially
when it comes to huntable species

48
00:05:02,784 --> 00:05:09,335
like roan antelopes, warthogs,
waterbucks, etcetera.

49
00:05:09,535 --> 00:05:17,856
After several tests, the line
transects by walking on foot.

50
00:05:17,918 --> 00:05:23,005
This is foot samplings
on line-transect systems or method

51
00:05:23,142 --> 00:05:27,569
that was chosen for the site.

52
00:05:28,482 --> 00:05:35,041
To get even more information
on the diversity of species

53
00:05:35,241 --> 00:05:40,474
in the park, scientific results
are also used,

54
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:46,812
as well as data that is collected
by tourists.

55
00:05:48,277 --> 00:05:54,602
It is by this way that the range was able
to complete the list of bird species

56
00:05:54,640 --> 00:06:03,502
that is already 290 as known, 
for example for the park.

57
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:11,625
Hunting enables the collection 
of species biometric data

58
00:06:11,697 --> 00:06:18,457
from killed animals, including
weight, height, horn size, etcetera.

59
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:25,832
This gives information on the health
conditions of the species,

60
00:06:25,992 --> 00:06:31,473
such as waterbuck or roan antelope,
and indirectly,

61
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:37,721
on the food availability 
inside the park over years.

62
00:06:39,298 --> 00:06:46,699
In monitoring the anthropic pressures
on different animal and plant values,

63
00:06:46,899 --> 00:06:52,804
listed until now,
is essentially conducted

64
00:06:53,004 --> 00:07:00,153
through surveillance;
I mean, law enforcement.

65
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:06,561
This gives the possibility
of specifically recording

66
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:13,320
any form of harms done
to the targeted species

67
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:20,476
namely, signs of poaching,
or wood cuttings

68
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:23,298
and other types of collections.

69
00:07:24,552 --> 00:07:32,243
Monitoring habitat and flora
is enhanced by research activities

70
00:07:32,356 --> 00:07:38,536
that are focused
on specific themes identified

71
00:07:38,636 --> 00:07:42,708
during the ecological
monitoring processes.

72
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:49,186
They are mostly carried out
by students or researchers

73
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:55,829
in direct link with the park's staff
and are coordinated

74
00:07:55,929 --> 00:07:58,044
by the park's manager.

75
00:07:58,832 --> 00:08:05,500
One of Nazinga's main problems
is related to elephants

76
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:11,396
which are one of the monitored values
of the protected area

77
00:08:11,859 --> 00:08:18,996
as they create conflict in the villages
surrounding the park.

78
00:08:19,434 --> 00:08:24,685
This threat is monitored
by collecting information

79
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,642
on the damages around the range

80
00:08:29,017 --> 00:08:36,262
which are systematically recorded
and allow to understand

81
00:08:36,788 --> 00:08:39,589
elephant's population dynamics,

82
00:08:39,883 --> 00:08:45,810
as well as their moment
and damage frequencies.

83
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:50,103
This will naturally help
the management

84
00:08:50,503 --> 00:08:56,115
to implement suitable
preventive measures.

85
00:08:57,688 --> 00:09:04,170
In all ecological monitoring systems
implemented in Nazinga

86
00:09:04,258 --> 00:09:09,254
enables the range managers to obtain

87
00:09:09,704 --> 00:09:18,719
both the qualitative and quantitative
information that they need

88
00:09:19,107 --> 00:09:23,427
to carry out interannual comparison

89
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:32,796
and to evaluate the shifting trends
of the protected area values

90
00:09:32,996 --> 00:09:39,530
in terms of animals' numbers
or habitat quality

91
00:09:40,268 --> 00:09:48,099
or even to understand
anthropic pressures that face the range.

92
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:54,942
This is also always to evaluate
and adjust management

93
00:09:55,042 --> 00:09:59,117
and valorisation decisions
of natural resources

94
00:09:59,164 --> 00:10:06,017
inside the range, especially
when it comes to hunting game.

95
00:10:06,217 --> 00:10:11,724
This reaches a key value
for the parks.
