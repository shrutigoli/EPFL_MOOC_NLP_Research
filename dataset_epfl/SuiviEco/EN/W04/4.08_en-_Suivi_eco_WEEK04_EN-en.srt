1
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:11,040
Wetlands are ecotones,

2
00:00:11,189 --> 00:00:14,071
areas of transition
between water and land,

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:16,587
which diverse function give them

4
00:00:16,761 --> 00:00:20,137
remarkable biological, ideological,

5
00:00:20,299 --> 00:00:23,028
economical and sociological values.

6
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:27,903
In the MOOC
on protected areas management,

7
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:31,716
we have seen that wetlands
face many threats:

8
00:00:31,878 --> 00:00:33,681
drainage, industrialisation,

9
00:00:33,856 --> 00:00:36,439
pollution, urbanization and so on,

10
00:00:36,601 --> 00:00:40,251
which keep reducing their size.

11
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,150
According to the Ramsar Convention,

12
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:45,958
waterbirds are species of birds

13
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:49,787
that are ecologically dependent
upon wetlands.

14
00:00:50,791 --> 00:00:56,861
Here we consider waterbird species
as a value of wetlands.

15
00:00:57,049 --> 00:01:01,307
And we will see how their attributes
ought to be monitored,

16
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,160
especially the diversity of species,

17
00:01:04,322 --> 00:01:08,592
and their number
of individual per species.

18
00:01:08,995 --> 00:01:11,360
Waterbirds are monitored

19
00:01:11,522 --> 00:01:15,339
because they are indicators
of the quality of wetlands.

20
00:01:15,514 --> 00:01:18,340
First, according
to the Ramsar Convention

21
00:01:18,515 --> 00:01:21,378
a wetland is considered
globally important

22
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,178
when it includes at least
1% of waterbirds populations.

23
00:01:26,353 --> 00:01:30,016
1% can be a very big
number of birds.

24
00:01:30,204 --> 00:01:32,095
They can also be monitored

25
00:01:32,283 --> 00:01:34,564
because of their sustainable use

26
00:01:34,739 --> 00:01:38,227
for vision, tourism,
or hunting, for instance.

27
00:01:39,457 --> 00:01:44,786
Monitoring namely
has to draw up or update

28
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:46,443
wetland management plans.

29
00:01:46,593 --> 00:01:49,088
Or to design sampling plans

30
00:01:49,263 --> 00:01:52,279
correlated with
the available resources.

31
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:57,507
In this unit, we will talk about
direct monitoring methods.

32
00:01:57,695 --> 00:02:01,204
These methods depend
on many factors, such as:

33
00:02:01,392 --> 00:02:03,029
The monitored species,

34
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:05,261
the size of the site,

35
00:02:05,386 --> 00:02:07,264
coastal accessibility,

36
00:02:07,414 --> 00:02:10,320
observation points given
another view,

37
00:02:10,469 --> 00:02:14,054
the time available
to carry out the count,

38
00:02:14,191 --> 00:02:16,168
the number of people to include,

39
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:19,206
and the equipment available.

40
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:20,954
In all cases,

41
00:02:21,091 --> 00:02:24,032
monitoring requires
experienced staff,

42
00:02:24,194 --> 00:02:26,602
and meticulous preparation

43
00:02:26,764 --> 00:02:28,545
as always in monitoring.

44
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:30,294
If possible,

45
00:02:30,431 --> 00:02:34,228
apply the same monitoring protocol
during each site visit.

46
00:02:34,377 --> 00:02:39,045
It can, however, be difficult
to standardize counting protocols

47
00:02:39,194 --> 00:02:42,723
on sites undergoing
important changes over time.

48
00:02:43,072 --> 00:02:45,660
And that is particularly
true for wetlands.

49
00:02:45,797 --> 00:02:49,503
Frost, draught, or floods,

50
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:52,281
can greatly influence
the counting conditions

51
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,142
from a year to the next.

52
00:02:54,304 --> 00:02:56,467
And these factors
should be considered

53
00:02:56,616 --> 00:02:58,917
when drawing up protocols

54
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:03,139
and of course when you
proceed to data analysis.

55
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:08,506
Waterbirds can be monitored directly
in 3 different ways. 

56
00:03:08,965 --> 00:03:11,147
One, ground counts,

57
00:03:11,309 --> 00:03:15,068
usually done on foot,
sometimes by bicycle or by car.

58
00:03:15,217 --> 00:03:18,091
Two, monitoring from a boat.

59
00:03:18,265 --> 00:03:19,015
And three, 

60
00:03:19,164 --> 00:03:22,857
aerial monitoring from a plane
or a helicopter.

61
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:25,691
Of course, ground counts
are the easiest

62
00:03:25,828 --> 00:03:27,854
and most commonly used protocol.

63
00:03:28,511 --> 00:03:30,061
And also the cheapest.

64
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:33,343
You can also take
photographs or films,

65
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:36,786
and use these to individually
count birds

66
00:03:36,955 --> 00:03:39,504
 after you've done those pictures.

67
00:03:39,653 --> 00:03:42,656
Or simply verify
the observer's estimates.

68
00:03:42,818 --> 00:03:44,390
During each visit,

69
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:48,254
the site should systematically
be covered on foot

70
00:03:48,403 --> 00:03:51,863
following an identical,
predetermined route

71
00:03:52,037 --> 00:03:53,644
following the transect model,

72
00:03:53,806 --> 00:03:56,998
used by (INAUDIBLE)
to identify the birds.

73
00:03:57,147 --> 00:03:59,383
Identify the species,

74
00:03:59,558 --> 00:04:02,421
count individual
of each species,

75
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:07,038
determine the gender ratio for some
of them when it is feasible,

76
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,680
observe interspecific combinations,

77
00:04:09,842 --> 00:04:13,942
note feeding behaviors
and habits, and so on.

78
00:04:14,104 --> 00:04:17,830
As there can be many individuals
at the same place,

79
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:20,900
bird counts are often
done per block.

80
00:04:21,062 --> 00:04:25,899
Experienced observers can count
blocks of 10, 20, 50, 100 birds

81
00:04:26,073 --> 00:04:26,954
or more.

82
00:04:27,103 --> 00:04:30,277
Birds on the first block
are generally counted one by one.

83
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:33,252
Then the mental image
of the first block

84
00:04:33,427 --> 00:04:34,583
is carried forwards

85
00:04:34,757 --> 00:04:35,773
to the entire group

86
00:04:35,935 --> 00:04:37,656
to estimate the total number.

87
00:04:38,415 --> 00:04:41,390
Most observers
use blocks of 10 birds.

88
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:44,390
It can be complicated
to go above that number.

89
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:45,965
A tally counter

90
00:04:46,127 --> 00:04:49,884
reckoning number
of birds or blocks,

91
00:04:50,033 --> 00:04:51,940
can improve precision and avoid

92
00:04:52,077 --> 00:04:54,652
forgetting an individual or block,
of course.

93
00:04:54,813 --> 00:04:57,599
You can also use a voice recorder,

94
00:04:57,786 --> 00:05:00,489
or ask help from a colleague. 

95
00:05:00,689 --> 00:05:03,412
Blocks of 100 birds or more

96
00:05:03,561 --> 00:05:06,749
are generally only
applied to birds flying.

97
00:05:06,901 --> 00:05:10,824
Or when the time at hand
to count is very limited.

98
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,749
In this case

99
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:13,936
it is usually easier to proceed

100
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,649
from the back of a fleet

101
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:18,961
by examining the group
in its flying direction

102
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:22,801
using binoculars or a telescope.

103
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:24,949
Not easy, but feasible.

104
00:05:25,103 --> 00:05:26,989
Of course, on small sites,

105
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:29,401
it is better to count birds
one by one.

106
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:33,738
It is usually easier to count birds
that are resting or feeding,

107
00:05:33,921 --> 00:05:36,858
standing on the ground,
or on the water.

108
00:05:37,329 --> 00:05:40,713
If you wish to monitor
a colony of breeding birds,

109
00:05:40,886 --> 00:05:44,851
it is crucial to minimize the risk
of disturbing them,

110
00:05:45,014 --> 00:05:48,213
and the observer should
avoid getting too close

111
00:05:48,389 --> 00:05:52,613
whether on foot, by car
boat or on plane.

112
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:55,151
Just to avoid disturbance.

113
00:05:55,342 --> 00:05:58,688
Just like it is
for all types of monitoring,

114
00:05:58,905 --> 00:06:01,162
aiming at detecting
(INAUDIBLE) variations,

115
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:03,332
the same site should be counted

116
00:06:03,487 --> 00:06:05,082
season after season

117
00:06:05,242 --> 00:06:08,970
following the same
standardized protocol.

118
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:10,507
The different methods

119
00:06:10,671 --> 00:06:12,370
can go from a rough estimate

120
00:06:12,555 --> 00:06:15,332
of a total number
of breeding birds present

121
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:18,101
to a total count of occupied nests.

122
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:21,695
If the colony is counted
only once during breeding season,

123
00:06:21,863 --> 00:06:25,595
all the nests occupied
by eggs or chicks

124
00:06:25,766 --> 00:06:26,870
should be counted.

125
00:06:27,027 --> 00:06:29,882
If the count takes place monthly,

126
00:06:30,047 --> 00:06:33,866
only nests occupied by eggs
should be counted.

127
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:36,357
As for larger colonies,

128
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:40,845
proceed once more
to estimates by counting in blocks.

129
00:06:41,024 --> 00:06:43,482
For birds breeding
on large surfaces,

130
00:06:43,664 --> 00:06:46,845
the total number of birds
can also be estimated

131
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:49,207
through quadrat sampling,
for instance,

132
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:51,432
and extrapolations.

133
00:06:51,626 --> 00:06:52,845
In the end,

134
00:06:52,986 --> 00:06:55,520
good monitoring is, above all, 

135
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:59,695
based on the observer's
quality and precision.

136
00:06:59,864 --> 00:07:04,328
But of course, this is true for all
types of monitoring.
