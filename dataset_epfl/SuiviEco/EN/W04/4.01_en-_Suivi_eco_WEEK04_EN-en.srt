00:00:09,737 --> 00:00:14,255
Hello, and welcome to the
fourth and last unit of our MOOK

2
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:15,716
on ecological monitoring.

3
00:00:16,208 --> 00:00:19,146
In this unit, we will give
several examples

4
00:00:19,196 --> 00:00:23,188
of ecological monitoring
directly taken from the field.

5
00:00:23,571 --> 00:00:26,069
Again, Inza Kone, social professor

6
00:00:26,138 --> 00:00:29,244
at the Houphouët-Boigny University
of Côte d'Ivoire

7
00:00:29,494 --> 00:00:32,169
and Emmanuel Iman, social professor

8
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:34,989
at the Ki-Zerbo University
in Burkina le Faso

9
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:37,102
will be helping us out.

10
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:42,095
Let us follow some elephants
to see what will be presented

11
00:00:42,633 --> 00:00:44,033
in this unit.

12
00:00:44,233 --> 00:00:47,183
First off, we will consider
the different levels

13
00:00:47,433 --> 00:00:50,111
at which ecological monitoring
can be done

14
00:00:50,311 --> 00:00:52,550
from a global to a local level.

15
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:56,699
Then, with Beatrice,
we will be looking at a group

16
00:00:56,899 --> 00:00:59,899
of particular areas
in Kenya working together

17
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:01,745
to monitor the animals.

18
00:01:01,945 --> 00:01:06,379
After this, along with Emmanuel,
we will be looking at the Nazinga Park

19
00:01:06,579 --> 00:01:09,203
a terrestrial particular area
in Burkina le Faso.

20
00:01:09,753 --> 00:01:13,431
We will, of course, not forget
about the marine environment

21
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:16,631
the (INAUDIBLE) seashells
will be

22
00:01:16,831 --> 00:01:18,657
a particularly interesting example.

23
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:22,737
At the scale of the park,
we will make the difference

24
00:01:22,787 --> 00:01:25,487
between monitoring forest,
with the example

25
00:01:25,562 --> 00:01:27,487
of Tai National Park
in Ivory Coast

26
00:01:27,687 --> 00:01:32,063
and monitoring the savannah
which Inza will be explaining.

27
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:35,838
In this case, we will be traveling
to Comoé National Park,

28
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:41,623
The next section will be wetlands
and we will try to monitor the birds

29
00:01:41,673 --> 00:01:43,367
populating these areas.

30
00:01:44,363 --> 00:01:48,460
Then we will focus on monitoring
a specific species and we will take

31
00:01:48,522 --> 00:01:50,618
the example of the elephant.

32
00:01:51,555 --> 00:01:55,537
Finally, we will briefly present
twenty golden rules of monitoring

33
00:01:55,587 --> 00:01:58,190
that we think may be useful
to keep in mind

34
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:00,757
and could probably help you
with your work.

35
00:02:01,357 --> 00:02:02,368
That's it.

36
00:02:02,568 --> 00:02:05,554
Now don't forget about the quizzes
between the sequences.

37
00:02:05,792 --> 00:02:07,942
They will help you
better understand the examples

38
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:10,795
and take (INAUDIBLE) from them.

39
00:02:10,995 --> 00:02:13,907
Have an excellent fourth unit.
