1
00:00:08,565 --> 00:00:10,312
We've seen in this MOOC

2
00:00:10,475 --> 00:00:13,967
what ecological monitoring
of protected area means.

3
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:18,187
It is the assessment
of a peer value conditions.

4
00:00:18,351 --> 00:00:22,587
This value is characterized
by its ecological attributes,

5
00:00:22,741 --> 00:00:24,762
described by indicators.

6
00:00:24,903 --> 00:00:27,750
All this follows a protocol

7
00:00:27,894 --> 00:00:30,100
that determines the sampling plan,

8
00:00:30,252 --> 00:00:32,487
the method that will be used,

9
00:00:32,623 --> 00:00:34,450
dependent on the context,

10
00:00:34,597 --> 00:00:35,850
on the competencies,

11
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:38,062
and the means at hand.

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,375
So as a conclusion,

13
00:00:40,522 --> 00:00:42,723
let's keep some
simple rules in mind.

14
00:00:44,703 --> 00:00:48,037
Ecological monitoring
must have a purpose.

15
00:00:48,203 --> 00:00:51,762
And is thereby not a simple
collection of information,

16
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,425
that nobody needs,

17
00:00:53,578 --> 00:00:56,100
and that will pile up for nothing

18
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,964
in the manager's office.

19
00:00:58,636 --> 00:01:02,387
The purpose for the monitoring
needs to be clearly defined,

20
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,565
to be understood by the managers,

21
00:01:04,702 --> 00:01:08,063
executants and those to whom
the results will be sent to.

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:12,925
Monitoring is part
of the protected area's management.

23
00:01:13,087 --> 00:01:16,675
Particularly during the preparation
of the management plan,

24
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:20,850
during the assessment
of its effectiveness,

25
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:24,072
and in daily staff activities.

26
00:01:24,684 --> 00:01:27,750
Monitoring identifies
what is being monitored,

27
00:01:27,886 --> 00:01:30,262
and it is based on the protected
area's values

28
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:32,450
it describes
the ecological attributes,

29
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:36,945
and the indicators
that will be chosen in priority.

30
00:01:37,587 --> 00:01:41,125
Monitoring needs
qualitative criteria,

31
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,212
and is therefore assessed
for the results it provides,

32
00:01:45,379 --> 00:01:48,629
but also for the way
it is carried out.

33
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:52,100
It is based on the strong knowledge
of the ecology of the values

34
00:01:52,249 --> 00:01:53,623
that are to be monitored.

35
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:57,350
Monitoring is adapted
to the monitored values,

36
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,850
its responsiveness, in particular,

37
00:01:59,989 --> 00:02:02,137
allows to detect variations

38
00:02:02,306 --> 00:02:06,612
of the ecological attributes
in a good and workable way.

39
00:02:07,495 --> 00:02:10,762
Sampling must be
precise and relevant.

40
00:02:10,913 --> 00:02:12,055
The chosen method

41
00:02:12,192 --> 00:02:14,825
must be representative
and explainable to all.

42
00:02:14,989 --> 00:02:18,875
And it must give way
to the least bias possible.

43
00:02:19,012 --> 00:02:21,550
Monitoring means effort.

44
00:02:21,707 --> 00:02:26,087
So sampling needs
to be random, if possible,

45
00:02:26,259 --> 00:02:29,312
and not centered
on the accessible areas

46
00:02:29,448 --> 00:02:33,853
or the ones where we know
species are plentiful.

47
00:02:34,422 --> 00:02:37,175
The chosen method needs
to be sustainable,

48
00:02:37,327 --> 00:02:40,556
therefore needs to remain
unchanged over time.

49
00:02:40,706 --> 00:02:44,671
Or the possible changes
need to be justified, at least.

50
00:02:45,401 --> 00:02:47,368
Honesty is key.

51
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:49,530
Meaning, tampering with protocol

52
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:53,668
or results, to make them
more impactful or meaningful,

53
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:55,018
is useless,

54
00:02:55,163 --> 00:02:57,268
and will sooner or later

55
00:02:57,431 --> 00:02:58,832
be noticed.

56
00:02:59,736 --> 00:03:02,543
You need to keep the original
hypotheses in mind,

57
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:03,905
because the conditions,

58
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:05,530
the choice of methods,

59
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:09,099
can influence the way
we interpret the data.

60
00:03:10,094 --> 00:03:13,155
The surveying method
needs to be replicable

61
00:03:13,315 --> 00:03:14,854
by each operator.

62
00:03:14,991 --> 00:03:18,479
Because individuals
don't make the results.

63
00:03:19,384 --> 00:03:23,230
The monitoring results
have to be used for what they are.

64
00:03:23,394 --> 00:03:25,630
If the bias are too important,

65
00:03:25,794 --> 00:03:28,732
you need to have the wisdom
and the courage to speak up.

66
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:32,980
You also need to be smart

67
00:03:33,154 --> 00:03:34,905
when extrapolating the data.

68
00:03:35,075 --> 00:03:39,755
Because you can have statistics
to say what you want them to say.

69
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:41,630
So common sense

70
00:03:41,766 --> 00:03:43,449
need to prevail.

71
00:03:44,237 --> 00:03:47,468
If you want monitoring
to be realistic and sustainable,

72
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,430
it needs to be adapted to skills,

73
00:03:49,606 --> 00:03:51,828
to the needs and the site of course.

74
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:55,730
Monitoring needs to be enhanced.

75
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:56,918
In other words,

76
00:03:57,042 --> 00:03:58,231
the cost,

77
00:03:58,368 --> 00:03:59,868
the working time needed,

78
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:02,168
the means to mobilize,

79
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:04,355
and the skills to acquire,

80
00:04:04,537 --> 00:04:07,964
need to be extremely well-managed.

81
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:12,105
All the relevant data need
to be accessible and stored.

82
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:14,343
This will guarantee transparency,

83
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:17,894
sustainability and credibility
of the monitoring.

84
00:04:18,347 --> 00:04:21,630
The results need
to be communicated simply.

85
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:24,455
Meaning that monitoring is useful

86
00:04:24,614 --> 00:04:28,297
only if the results are shared.

87
00:04:29,152 --> 00:04:31,080
Finally, monitoring is carried out

88
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:34,418
by the stakeholders of the protected
area's management itself,

89
00:04:34,573 --> 00:04:36,343
and shouldn't be outsourced.

90
00:04:36,512 --> 00:04:37,981
The first call of monitoring

91
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,981
is indeed to improve
the site's management itself.

92
00:04:42,588 --> 00:04:43,355
There you go.

93
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:45,005
Some simple rules

94
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:47,818
that we hope will be useful daily

95
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:51,715
in the execution
of your ecological monitoring plan.
