1
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:11,358
In Kenya, the protected area network

2
00:00:11,392 --> 00:00:13,692
is made out of parks
and national reserves

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,515
but also of many conservancies
that are, in fact, 

4
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:19,337
either committee-based or
private protected areas.

5
00:00:19,959 --> 00:00:25,541
The Northern Rangelands Trust - NRT -
is an organization that provides

6
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:28,389
technical support
to committee-based conservancies

7
00:00:28,514 --> 00:00:31,665
to help them to set up
a sustainable network

8
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:34,365
of conservancies
throughout the country.

9
00:00:35,065 --> 00:00:39,017
To this end, NRT helps
committee-based conservancies

10
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:42,772
to design their own
ecological monitoring program

11
00:00:42,972 --> 00:00:47,257
according to their own needs
and to what is technically

12
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:49,269
and financially feasible.

13
00:00:49,806 --> 00:00:53,994
For this, they will use a range
of tools called wild-life comms

14
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:57,054
for conservancy management
monitoring systems

15
00:00:57,129 --> 00:01:02,486
which is a template
of monitoring forms, of databases,

16
00:01:02,686 --> 00:01:05,686
and data analysis tests
that can be adjusted 

17
00:01:05,886 --> 00:01:08,699
according to the needs
of each of the conservancies.

18
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:12,111
Within a conservancy,
when they develop

19
00:01:12,161 --> 00:01:15,398
the ecological monitoring program,
on the basis of comms, too,

20
00:01:16,133 --> 00:01:20,445
managers, rangers and stakeholders
like the traditional chiefs,

21
00:01:20,833 --> 00:01:26,061
will first gather together
and define a shared vision

22
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:30,810
for their conservancy in terms
of conservation of the nature.

23
00:01:32,436 --> 00:01:36,305
Then, they determine
what are the species

24
00:01:36,505 --> 00:01:39,618
that could provide useful information
to reflect the health

25
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,430
 of this ecosystem,

26
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,349
and among these species
that they identify

27
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:49,800
they eventually choose the one
that can be easily observable,

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
that are well-known,
and often encountered

29
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,237
in order to guarantee that the rangers
will gather, afterwards,

30
00:01:57,305 --> 00:02:01,697
enough information and
reliable information

31
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,129
in order to feed the future
statistical analysis.

32
00:02:05,579 --> 00:02:07,748
For instance,
in the Westgate conservancy,

33
00:02:07,948 --> 00:02:10,948
the values that have been chosen
are the buffaloes, the elephants,

34
00:02:11,461 --> 00:02:14,886
zebras, predators like hyenas,
cheetahs and lions,

35
00:02:14,935 --> 00:02:18,455
as well as ostriches, warthog
and several species

36
00:02:18,505 --> 00:02:19,346
of antelopes.

37
00:02:20,236 --> 00:02:22,648
In this case, the ecological
attributes to assess

38
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:25,236
in to monitor these values,
these species,

39
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,538
are the evolution 
of the species' density over time

40
00:02:28,576 --> 00:02:29,814
and their distribution.

41
00:02:30,014 --> 00:02:34,690
This is very useful information
that helps detecting animal enemies

42
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,624
such as new threats
that will need to be controlled.

43
00:02:38,405 --> 00:02:42,701
On this graph, you see that over
the last three years, 

44
00:02:42,797 --> 00:02:46,039
population of cheetahs, eland
and elephants have been coming

45
00:02:46,139 --> 00:02:49,749
more and more to Westgate Conservancy,
in spite of buffalo populations.

46
00:02:50,314 --> 00:02:52,841
Now that's a good question
to be analyzed

47
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:54,374
by the conservancy's managers.

48
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,454
The indicators to measure
these ecological attributes

49
00:02:57,654 --> 00:03:02,126
are the number of living individuals, 
of course, that are encountered

50
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:05,542
by the rangers, but also
the carcasses they may see

51
00:03:05,742 --> 00:03:10,027
and the indicators aiming
at monitoring illegal activities

52
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:13,216
and human wildlife conflict
in and around the conservancy.

53
00:03:13,512 --> 00:03:16,384
As means in these conservancies
are limited,

54
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:20,018
it's not possible to hire staff
specifically dedicated

55
00:03:20,218 --> 00:03:23,716
to ecological monitoring,
so the rangers are the ones

56
00:03:23,753 --> 00:03:26,778
in charge of collecting information
for ecological monitoring

57
00:03:26,828 --> 00:03:27,889
during their patrols.

58
00:03:28,423 --> 00:03:31,599
The counting will, therefore, be done
on foot and by blocks.

59
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:36,778
The tool used to record the data
are paper forms,

60
00:03:36,796 --> 00:03:40,252
which is a simple method and,
therefore, very sustainable

61
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:41,121
and affordable.

62
00:03:41,843 --> 00:03:45,021
The data from the monitoring form
fed in by the rangers

63
00:03:45,146 --> 00:03:49,438
are then recorded in the database
and the person within the conservancy

64
00:03:49,488 --> 00:03:53,006
in charge of the database
can extract from it all the reports

65
00:03:53,206 --> 00:03:56,081
showing the evolution
of the population

66
00:03:56,143 --> 00:03:58,693
of monitored species
and their distribution

67
00:03:58,718 --> 00:04:01,655
among the different blocks
in the protected area.

68
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,726
And here is an example
of the kind of report

69
00:04:04,805 --> 00:04:06,528
you can extract from the database.

70
00:04:06,728 --> 00:04:10,809
And this is the map that shows
the distribution of elephants

71
00:04:11,009 --> 00:04:13,816
throughout one year
in Westgate Conservancy.

72
00:04:14,682 --> 00:04:18,047
Then the analysis
of monthly ecological monitoring reports

73
00:04:18,147 --> 00:04:22,282
allows to rethink which areas
should be better controlled

74
00:04:22,482 --> 00:04:25,482
by future patrols to guarantee
all blocks have been covered

75
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:30,228
in an equitable way or to choose
an intervention to reduce

76
00:04:30,428 --> 00:04:34,351
human-elephant conflicts
in the high-risk zone,

77
00:04:34,413 --> 00:04:35,367
if there are any.

78
00:04:35,834 --> 00:04:40,479
So these two kinds of decisions are
good examples of adaptive management

79
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,845
based on
ecological monitoring results.

80
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:49,192
Thus, the comm's tools
in the Kenyan conservancies

81
00:04:49,597 --> 00:04:52,137
shows that it's possible to implement

82
00:04:52,209 --> 00:04:54,863
simple and cheap 
ecological monitoring systems

83
00:04:55,063 --> 00:04:58,063
adapted to the needs
of each particular conservancy

84
00:04:58,251 --> 00:05:01,772
and that provide relevant information
for management decision making.

85
00:05:02,508 --> 00:05:06,718
As the managers themselves decide
what value they want to monitor

86
00:05:06,755 --> 00:05:09,118
and they are the ones responsible

87
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:13,310
for the storage and analysis
of the data throughout the year,

88
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:18,020
they are taking ownership
of the ecological monitoring

89
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:21,177
which guarantees its sustainability
over time.
