00:00:08,895 --> 00:00:13,050
We have reached the end of this MOOC
on ecological monitoring.

2
00:00:13,149 --> 00:00:16,366
I hope you that have enjoyed
participating in it

3
00:00:16,478 --> 00:00:19,113
as much as we have enjoyed
preparing the course.

4
00:00:19,961 --> 00:00:23,493
And of course I do hope it helped
you better understand

5
00:00:23,592 --> 00:00:26,353
how important
ecological monitoring is

6
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:28,657
for the health of protected areas

7
00:00:28,769 --> 00:00:31,418
and for the entire
decision making process.

8
00:00:32,496 --> 00:00:34,691
I would like to thank
a couple of people.
