Hello, and welcome to the fourth and last unit of our MOOK on ecological monitoring.
In this unit, we will give several examples of ecological monitoring directly taken from the field.
Again, Inza Kone, social professor at the HouphouÃ«t-Boigny University of CÃ´te d'Ivoire and Emmanuel Iman, social professor at the Ki-Zerbo University in Burkina le Faso will be helping us out.
Let us follow some elephants to see what will be presented in this unit.
First off, we will consider the different levels at which ecological monitoring can be done from a global to a local level.
Then, with Beatrice, we will be looking at a group of particular areas in Kenya working together to monitor the animals.
After this, along with Emmanuel, we will be looking at the Nazinga Park a terrestrial particular area in Burkina le Faso.
We will, of course, not forget about the marine environment the (INAUDIBLE) seashells will be a particularly interesting example.
At the scale of the park, we will make the difference between monitoring forest, with the example of Tai National Park in Ivory Coast and monitoring the savannah which Inza will be explaining.
In this case, we will be traveling to ComoÃ© National Park,
The next section will be wetlands and we will try to monitor the birds populating these areas.
Then we will focus on monitoring a specific species and we will take the example of the elephant.
Finally, we will briefly present twenty golden rules of monitoring that we think may be useful to keep in mind and could probably help you with your work.
That's it.
Now don't forget about the quizzes between the sequences.
They will help you better understand the examples and take (INAUDIBLE) from them.
Have an excellent fourth unit.
