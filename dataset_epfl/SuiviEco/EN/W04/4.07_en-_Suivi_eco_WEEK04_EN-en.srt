1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:10,824
The Comoé National Park,

2
00:00:10,961 --> 00:00:12,783
or CNP,

3
00:00:12,933 --> 00:00:16,533
is located in the northeast
of Cote d'Ivoire,

4
00:00:16,957 --> 00:00:24,924
and covers 1'149'000 hectares

5
00:00:25,086 --> 00:00:28,912
or over 2.8 million acres.

6
00:00:29,448 --> 00:00:32,082
It is the largest protected area

7
00:00:32,219 --> 00:00:35,255
in west end Sub-Saharan Africa.

8
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:37,980
This park is representative

9
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:41,099
of Cote d'Ivoire's savannah biomes.

10
00:00:41,249 --> 00:00:46,400
It was classified
Biosphere Reserve in 1982,

11
00:00:46,562 --> 00:00:50,414
and World Heritage Site in 1983.

12
00:00:51,006 --> 00:00:53,266
At the Comoé National Park

13
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,571
pressures have increased

14
00:00:55,721 --> 00:00:58,931
during the long 
political and military crisis

15
00:00:59,094 --> 00:01:03,571
the country went through
between 2002 and 2011.

16
00:01:03,708 --> 00:01:04,956
These threats

17
00:01:05,118 --> 00:01:08,929
have caused resurges in gold mining,

18
00:01:09,079 --> 00:01:11,709
illegal transhumance and poaching,

19
00:01:11,859 --> 00:01:15,386
which led to the depletion
of some animal species,

20
00:01:15,511 --> 00:01:19,875
such as chimpanzees,
elephants and lions.

21
00:01:20,547 --> 00:01:24,295
In 2010 and 2014,

22
00:01:24,432 --> 00:01:27,597
the return of social
and political stability

23
00:01:27,747 --> 00:01:30,669
has allowed for 2 aerial sampling

24
00:01:30,831 --> 00:01:33,350
to take place
in the Comoé National Park,

25
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,422
with the technical support
of Wild Chimpanzee Foundation (WCF),

26
00:01:38,622 --> 00:01:40,194
and the GTZ.

27
00:01:40,635 --> 00:01:41,831
This study unit

28
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:45,056
is based on the result
of these 2 surveys,

29
00:01:45,218 --> 00:01:48,039
which were a form of surveys

30
00:01:48,214 --> 00:01:52,258
aiming at rediscovering the state
of the park and its values,

31
00:01:52,395 --> 00:01:54,874
and to reorganize management

32
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:58,192
based on the identified priorities.

33
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:02,906
Let's remember that surveillance
is not the same thing as monitoring,

34
00:02:03,068 --> 00:02:09,549
and that it is based on a series
of samplings repeated over time,

35
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:11,682
providing baseline data

36
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:16,191
for the later implementation
of ecological monitoring.

37
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:25,031
The study area
covers 16'703 km².

38
00:02:25,205 --> 00:02:29,150
It is made
of the Comoé National Park,

39
00:02:29,312 --> 00:02:31,760
and 2 biodiversity hotspots:

40
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:36,893
Warigué in the north 
and Mount Tingui in the south.

41
00:02:37,643 --> 00:02:40,340
In 2010 and 2014,

42
00:02:40,489 --> 00:02:42,744
the data collection methodology

43
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:47,396
consisted in systematically
[flying over] the study zones

44
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:50,378
by sampling [transects lines]
of different lanes. 

45
00:02:50,552 --> 00:02:54,871
The sampling system
included 45 transects

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:00,228
tilted at 20° to the north,
and led out regularly

47
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:04,998
and systematically 6 km
apart from each other.

48
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:13,867
In total, 2955 km of transects
were overflown

49
00:03:14,029 --> 00:03:18,312
among which, 70% were located
in the Comoé National Park.

50
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:24,049
The sampling rate
of the surveyed zone was 6.21%.

51
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:27,135
In 2010,

52
00:03:27,284 --> 00:03:35,374
a total of 8477 direct mammal
observations were made.

53
00:03:35,511 --> 00:03:36,725
Among these

54
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:40,706
with 90% of all individual scenes

55
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,229
domestic animals,
especially oxen,

56
00:03:44,378 --> 00:03:46,820
were the most encountered animals.

57
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:51,173
With 756 individuals,

58
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,240
representing 8.92%
of all observations,

59
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:59,655
the second most prevalent
species encountered

60
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:02,208
were the wild bovine species,

61
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,489
including hartebeests, buffalos,

62
00:04:05,638 --> 00:04:09,275
defasa waterbucks, kobs, bushbucks

63
00:04:09,424 --> 00:04:11,750
[INAUDIBLE] antelopes
and some duikers.

64
00:04:11,924 --> 00:04:13,227
As for primates,

65
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:17,068
two chimpanzees and 30 monkeys,

66
00:04:17,255 --> 00:04:19,708
among which were live baboons,

67
00:04:19,895 --> 00:04:22,798
patas and green monkeys
were observed.

68
00:04:22,947 --> 00:04:25,160
Two footprints of elephants

69
00:04:25,322 --> 00:04:29,142
and 36 individuals
of other mammal species

70
00:04:29,304 --> 00:04:31,372
were also observed.

71
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:33,460
Also

72
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:36,622
these special distribution maps

73
00:04:36,784 --> 00:04:42,457
show that the fauna was distributed
unevenly throughout the park,

74
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:45,821
and indicators
of entropic activities

75
00:04:45,983 --> 00:04:50,527
were found in the park
as well as on the outskirts.

76
00:04:51,546 --> 00:04:54,296
With more than 6000 domestic animals

77
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:56,506
observed in the Comoé National Park,

78
00:04:56,681 --> 00:04:59,889
during the 2010 survey

79
00:05:00,038 --> 00:05:03,838
was reduced 100 times in 2014

80
00:05:03,987 --> 00:05:05,890
to around 60.

81
00:05:06,077 --> 00:05:08,080
While the number of wild animals

82
00:05:08,254 --> 00:05:10,327
has increased 2 times,

83
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:13,652
going from 752

84
00:05:13,801 --> 00:05:17,312
to 1047 individuals.

85
00:05:17,487 --> 00:05:18,638
Furthermore,

86
00:05:18,812 --> 00:05:22,407
86.99% of domestic animals

87
00:05:22,582 --> 00:05:25,627
observed in the surveyed
in the area, in 2010,

88
00:05:25,801 --> 00:05:28,380
were found within
the Comoé National Park.

89
00:05:28,542 --> 00:05:30,416
While in 2014,

90
00:05:30,591 --> 00:05:35,397
that number went down to 4.58%.

91
00:05:36,347 --> 00:05:39,052
In both 2010 and 2014,

92
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:42,351
the special distribution
of bovine species

93
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,711
covered almost
the entire surveyed area.

94
00:05:45,885 --> 00:05:50,535
But in 2014, the distribution
of bovine observations

95
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:53,535
over the entire park was less even.

96
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:56,222
However, that same year

97
00:05:56,409 --> 00:05:58,696
the maximal encounter rate,

98
00:05:58,871 --> 00:06:00,738
8 individuals per kilometer,

99
00:06:00,912 --> 00:06:03,238
exceeded that of 2010, 

100
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,494
7 individuals per kilometer,

101
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:08,651
where areas of high-encounter rates

102
00:06:08,825 --> 00:06:11,835
of bovine species
were more isolated.

103
00:06:12,009 --> 00:06:13,157
First,

104
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:16,130
the chances of finding wild animals

105
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:20,729
are higher in the central parts
of Comoé National Park.

106
00:06:21,632 --> 00:06:23,213
In 2010,

107
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,591
rates of human activity encounters

108
00:06:26,765 --> 00:06:29,309
higher than 1 indicator
per kilometer,

109
00:06:29,471 --> 00:06:32,352
were essentially found
around the park,

110
00:06:32,551 --> 00:06:36,782
where more than 3 indicators
per kilometer were observed

111
00:06:36,957 --> 00:06:38,834
in the entire area.

112
00:06:38,971 --> 00:06:42,631
This is proof of a great
entropic pressure.

113
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:44,759
In 2014,

114
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:47,277
the encounter rate
of these indicators

115
00:06:47,452 --> 00:06:49,967
decreased
in the Comoé National Park

116
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:53,438
going from 5 indicators
per kilometer,

117
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:56,003
to 2 indicators per kilometer.

118
00:06:57,015 --> 00:07:01,327
Between 2010 and 2014,
in the Comoé National Park,

119
00:07:01,514 --> 00:07:04,836
there was indeed
a significant difference

120
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:09,990
between the encounter rates
of entropic activity indicators.

121
00:07:10,758 --> 00:07:13,758
These aerial surveys

122
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,005
give fundamental results

123
00:07:16,167 --> 00:07:19,852
on the state of the main
species still present,

124
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:23,856
which are potential
protected area values,

125
00:07:24,018 --> 00:07:27,859
and of some of their attributes:

126
00:07:28,021 --> 00:07:31,883
Where number, distribution,
group composition,

127
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,967
and threats they are facing.

128
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:37,401
Carrying out surveys
on the same zones

129
00:07:37,563 --> 00:07:39,947
and in similar conditions,

130
00:07:40,122 --> 00:07:42,484
shows the shifting trends

131
00:07:42,646 --> 00:07:46,998
of the attributes
at times where it is key

132
00:07:47,172 --> 00:07:51,719
to be able to closely monitor
park management decisions

133
00:07:51,893 --> 00:07:55,319
in the context
of the park's recovery.

134
00:07:56,119 --> 00:07:58,580
Great conservation efforts

135
00:07:58,742 --> 00:08:01,307
are first being made by managers

136
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:05,770
and the data collected
shows the results thereof.

137
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:09,900
But monitoring and actions
must continue;

138
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:13,772
because entropic pressures
on the Comoé National Park

139
00:08:13,971 --> 00:08:15,290
are still present.

140
00:08:15,452 --> 00:08:16,451
Namely,

141
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,442
in east peripheral zones.

142
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:23,418
This could have negative
impacts on the balance

143
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:26,401
of the Comoé National Park
ecosystem.
