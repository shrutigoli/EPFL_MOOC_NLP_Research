1
00:00:09,038 --> 00:00:13,440
Ecological monitoring in this MOOC
mainly deals with monitoring

2
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,919
at the level of a protected area.

3
00:00:16,119 --> 00:00:21,413
But there are plenty of other levels
where monitoring can be implemented.

4
00:00:21,613 --> 00:00:25,066
Sometimes, it doesn't involve
the entire protected area.

5
00:00:25,266 --> 00:00:28,755
It can be a specific system
or targeted species

6
00:00:28,817 --> 00:00:31,420
that will lead
to only monitoring the area

7
00:00:31,507 --> 00:00:33,556
in which these species exist.

8
00:00:34,044 --> 00:00:36,277
For example, chimps

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:39,602
 of the Niokolo Koba National Park
in Senegal

10
00:00:39,802 --> 00:00:43,545
have undergone specific monitoring
for a long time

11
00:00:43,745 --> 00:00:48,667
that usually only involved
the forest blocks they are present in.

12
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:52,629
In other words, less than ten percent
or fifteen percent

13
00:00:52,717 --> 00:00:54,788
of the parks' surface.

14
00:00:55,700 --> 00:01:00,016
If the indicators are well-chosen,
localized monitoring can, however,

15
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:02,979
adequately inform on the state
of the entire park

16
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,766
because generally
the conservation conditions

17
00:01:05,966 --> 00:01:09,327
are inherently linked and
local success depends

18
00:01:09,376 --> 00:01:11,134
on overall protection.

19
00:01:12,264 --> 00:01:16,084
Here is another example:
monitoring the large carnivore

20
00:01:16,304 --> 00:01:20,247
is sometimes taken as an indicator
of the overall state

21
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:22,799
of the protected area's conservation

22
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,760
as you mean that they are
the highest level of the food chain.

23
00:01:28,775 --> 00:01:31,751
This, however, is not always relevant.

24
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:37,269
Their number can decrease due
to targeted persecution from the (INAUDIBLE)

25
00:01:37,469 --> 00:01:40,599
while the rest of the protected area
is being preserved

26
00:01:40,999 --> 00:01:44,112
or they can prosper
by feeding themselves

27
00:01:44,174 --> 00:01:47,099
on the periphery of the area
while the antelopes of the park

28
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:50,174
become scarcer.

29
00:01:50,718 --> 00:01:53,605
So, in the long run,
managing the ecosystem

30
00:01:53,667 --> 00:01:57,769
by focusing on only one species
is not the most suitable solution.

31
00:01:58,305 --> 00:02:02,574
By the way, managing a site,
regardless to others

32
00:02:03,508 --> 00:02:07,283
 in the same network can give way
to some shortcuts.

33
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,417
Indeed.
It is useful, if not essential,

34
00:02:11,617 --> 00:02:14,791
to share the methods and results
with the other parks

35
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:17,542
in the same network,
like a national network

36
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:19,526
for protected areas, for instance.

37
00:02:19,726 --> 00:02:24,300
Or between protected area
covering the same kind of ecosystem

38
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,859
like marine areas or mountain areas.

39
00:02:28,347 --> 00:02:33,049
Otherwise, within a site,
you risk missing a trend

40
00:02:33,249 --> 00:02:36,249
visible at the level
of the entire network.

41
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,446
For instance, marine protected areas
should make sure the information obtained

42
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:46,175
from monitoring is communicated
from one area to the other.

43
00:02:47,009 --> 00:02:51,242
This makes sense when you look
at fish species or turtles

44
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:54,951
that will move from one area
to the other, obviously.

45
00:02:56,071 --> 00:03:01,186
The specific case of transmonitoring
protected areas is indicated.

46
00:03:01,386 --> 00:03:05,804
Of course, these sites share
the same natural resources

47
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:10,935
and ecological monitoring
should involve the entire ecosystem.

48
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,274
It is, however, rarely the case
because of logistical, administrative,

49
00:03:17,474 --> 00:03:20,212
and even legal difficulties.

50
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:24,238
Thus, monitoring elephants
in Pendjari National Park

51
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,990
shows strong variation from one year
to the other.

52
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,925
This doesn't mean an increase
or decrease of the population,

53
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,937
but simply the fact
that according to the state

54
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:38,094
of the environment, elephants
may still or already

55
00:03:38,294 --> 00:03:41,294
be in neighboring areas 
of the W National Park,

56
00:03:41,494 --> 00:03:43,973
the other national park, and so on.

57
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:47,532
So the only way, then, 
to get a proper idea

58
00:03:47,732 --> 00:03:52,168
of the population's number would be
by monitoring the entire territory

59
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,861
shared by Burkina, Benin and Niger.

60
00:03:57,536 --> 00:04:01,280
So, the question of monitoring
beyond the borders

61
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,480
of the protected area is,
of course, relevant.

62
00:04:04,971 --> 00:04:07,781
Many species are a value
for a protected area

63
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:10,981
but their distribution in space
or in time extends far beyond

64
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:13,960
the limits or the time
when the monitoring takes place.

65
00:04:14,404 --> 00:04:18,216
Adapting monitoring to the situation
seems to be a necessity.

66
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:24,279
Monitoring the species can be done
only when it is found

67
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,034
within the protected area.

68
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:30,208
The risk is then that
the conservation measures we will take

69
00:04:30,408 --> 00:04:34,012
will be disconnected
from real challenges,

70
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:38,501
challenges faced by the species
when it is located somewhere else.

71
00:04:39,845 --> 00:04:43,940
For instance, the elephant population
in N'Gouma in Mali

72
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:48,659
moves in a very vast area
between several different waterholes.

73
00:04:48,859 --> 00:04:53,396
Only counting animals that are
around one pond or waterhole

74
00:04:53,498 --> 00:04:55,212
doesn't provide a genuine idea

75
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:57,216
 of the threats
 faced by these elephants,

76
00:04:57,379 --> 00:05:00,202
nor does it give an idea
of possible solutions

77
00:05:00,402 --> 00:05:01,948
regarding their conservation.

78
00:05:03,156 --> 00:05:06,328
You can extend monitoring
to all the areas

79
00:05:06,528 --> 00:05:07,707
visited by the species.

80
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:12,753
In other words, adapting it
to specific moments in time

81
00:05:12,953 --> 00:05:15,230
when the species goes
to every site.

82
00:05:16,045 --> 00:05:21,546
This requires a strong collaboration
between sites, countries or regions.

83
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:25,228
A good example of this
is the water bird survey

84
00:05:25,428 --> 00:05:27,895
that takes place every year
around mid-January

85
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:31,517
in Europe, but also in Africa,
to have a better idea

86
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:32,990
of the species' population.

87
00:05:33,745 --> 00:05:38,781
You can also choose to focus
on the species, rather than the place,

88
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:43,647
wherever it may be, which requires
even better coordination.

89
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:47,968
Thus, many migrating bird species
are monitored mainly

90
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:51,558
thanks to colors or microchips
because they move a lot

91
00:05:51,649 --> 00:05:54,677
and inconsistently from one year
to another.

92
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:59,002
Localized monitoring wouldn't
have any sense other than to provide

93
00:05:59,138 --> 00:06:01,122
local information to the manager.

94
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:05,511
You can also use tools
that allow monitoring

95
00:06:05,561 --> 00:06:08,935
ecosystems as a whole
on a very big scale.

96
00:06:09,135 --> 00:06:13,335
It is a case of satellite images
that give information

97
00:06:13,535 --> 00:06:16,973
on the health state of entire sections
of the planet 

98
00:06:17,173 --> 00:06:21,022
and to hope, to better understand
what is happening locally

99
00:06:21,222 --> 00:06:23,919
by contextualizing the situation.

100
00:06:24,536 --> 00:06:29,083
A good example would be the impact
of climate change that can be hard

101
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:31,698
to detect locally
over a short period of time

102
00:06:31,811 --> 00:06:36,032
while there would be appearance
on the long period of time

103
00:06:36,105 --> 00:06:37,769
or on a big surface.

104
00:06:38,272 --> 00:06:40,761
For instance, the shrinking surface
of the wetland

105
00:06:40,961 --> 00:06:42,961
or the coastline changes.

106
00:06:43,355 --> 00:06:47,657
Finally, it is required to adapt
ecological monitoring

107
00:06:47,694 --> 00:06:50,981
to the characteristic of the species
or environments that you want

108
00:06:51,057 --> 00:06:54,815
to monitor, and
to the challenges they face.

109
00:06:55,015 --> 00:06:58,015
It is, therefore, not certain
that all the answers

110
00:06:58,086 --> 00:07:00,448
regarding the management
of the protected area

111
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:04,088
can be found at the level
of this protected area.

112
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:09,156
It will always be useful, anyway,
to see what is done, as well,

113
00:07:09,356 --> 00:07:12,356
at other levels in order to know
if the question 

114
00:07:12,556 --> 00:07:14,931
you are asking yourself
for your protected area

115
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:18,131
wouldn't be better treated
this way in other places?
