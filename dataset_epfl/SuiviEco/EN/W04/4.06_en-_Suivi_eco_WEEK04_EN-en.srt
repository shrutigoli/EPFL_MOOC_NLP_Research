1
00:00:09,018 --> 00:00:11,812
The Taï National Park, or TNP,

2
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,794
is located in the southwest 
of Côte d'Ivoire.

3
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:19,534
With each extension of
the zoo fauna reserve in the north,

4
00:00:19,734 --> 00:00:22,189
the TNP covers a surface area

5
00:00:22,389 --> 00:00:26,361
of around 536 thousand hectares.

6
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:30,334
Or of a 1.3 million acres.

7
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:35,727
It is the largest protected 
primary rain forest in West Africa.

8
00:00:35,927 --> 00:00:37,686
The park has been listed

9
00:00:37,886 --> 00:00:40,886
to the international network 
of Biosphere Reserves

10
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:43,174
in 1978,

11
00:00:43,374 --> 00:00:47,280
and World Heritage site in 1982,

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,338
in the framework of the MAB
UNESCO program

13
00:00:51,538 --> 00:00:54,391
shows how important it is.

14
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:57,369
For this case study,

15
00:00:57,569 --> 00:01:02,425
we'll be looking at the 10 phase
ecological monitoring program,

16
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:05,040
implemented in the Taï National Park

17
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:07,692
between 2005 and 2015,

18
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:10,892
to monitor all 
of the animal populations.

19
00:01:11,092 --> 00:01:16,965
This case is based on the result 
of data collected during phase 4,

20
00:01:17,165 --> 00:01:22,536
which took place between August 2008
and February 2009,

21
00:01:22,736 --> 00:01:26,811
as well as those 
from phases 2 and 3.

22
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:32,637
We will specifically look
at the duikers value.

23
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:36,900
Ecological monitoring 
in the TaÏ National Park

24
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,938
aims at assessing the following
ecological attributes:

25
00:01:42,138 --> 00:01:46,183
What is the duiker population 
size within the park?

26
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:50,088
What types of threats 
do they face in the park?

27
00:01:50,288 --> 00:01:54,781
How are these threats
and duiker populations

28
00:01:54,963 --> 00:01:57,314
distributed inside the park?

29
00:01:57,939 --> 00:02:01,503
The ecological monitoring method

30
00:02:01,703 --> 00:02:06,074
used to inform on these
3 ecological attributes

31
00:02:06,274 --> 00:02:10,510
is based on a total 
sweep of the park,

32
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:12,325
following transects.

33
00:02:12,525 --> 00:02:14,512
The aim was

34
00:02:14,712 --> 00:02:19,865
to look both for direct 
and indirect indicators 

35
00:02:20,065 --> 00:02:21,601
of duiker populations

36
00:02:21,801 --> 00:02:24,894
and other animal populations.

37
00:02:25,107 --> 00:02:29,115
Related pressures were also noted.

38
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:33,472
This illustration shows

39
00:02:33,672 --> 00:02:38,548
the layout of different transect
groups throughout the park.

40
00:02:38,748 --> 00:02:42,651
So, 368 kilometers of transects

41
00:02:42,851 --> 00:02:44,686
divided into 5 zones

42
00:02:44,886 --> 00:02:47,725
were roamed by sampling teams

43
00:02:47,925 --> 00:02:49,748
working simultaneously.

44
00:02:49,948 --> 00:02:52,948
Each transect measures 2 kilometers.

45
00:02:53,148 --> 00:02:57,514
They are led out regularly
throughout the park

46
00:02:57,714 --> 00:03:01,858
in groups of 4,
separated by 8 kilometers.

47
00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:07,619
And within a group, transects
are separated by 1 kilometer.

48
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:11,495
The data analysis

49
00:03:11,695 --> 00:03:14,544
mainly consisted in calculating

50
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:19,531
encounter rates and proportions
from the raw data,

51
00:03:19,731 --> 00:03:25,237
in order to estimate the population
size of duikers in the park.

52
00:03:26,171 --> 00:03:28,144
The Maxwell's duiker

53
00:03:28,344 --> 00:03:30,389
remains the most prevalent species

54
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:35,023
with 0.52 individual per kilometer.

55
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:36,894
The bay duiker

56
00:03:37,094 --> 00:03:39,346
is the second 
most encountered species.

57
00:03:39,546 --> 00:03:41,465
And the scarcest ones

58
00:03:41,665 --> 00:03:43,614
are the yellow-backed duikers

59
00:03:43,814 --> 00:03:45,873
and the zebra duikers.

60
00:03:46,073 --> 00:03:49,481
To get an idea of a distribution

61
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:51,534
of species in the park,

62
00:03:51,734 --> 00:03:53,387
simple distribution maps

63
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:57,578
were drawn up 
from ArcGis 9.2 software,

64
00:03:57,778 --> 00:04:01,176
by combining 
geographical coordinates

65
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:05,510
with the observations
made by transects

66
00:04:06,085 --> 00:04:10,359
Just as in phases 2 and 3,

67
00:04:10,559 --> 00:04:13,501
indicators of duiker presence

68
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:16,701
were found throughout 
the Taï National Park.

69
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:20,003
Areas with higher concentration,

70
00:04:20,203 --> 00:04:24,043
meaning more than 
10 indicators per kilometer,

71
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:27,443
were mainly in the east,

72
00:04:27,531 --> 00:04:29,611
as opposed to phase 2

73
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:32,849
where there were almost no zone

74
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:35,479
with high concentration 
of indicators.

75
00:04:35,679 --> 00:04:42,395
This situation could be a sign
of progressive recolonization

76
00:04:42,595 --> 00:04:46,965
of duikers in the entire
Taï National Park.

77
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,214
The total number of observations

78
00:04:50,414 --> 00:04:53,086
made on these transects
is important,

79
00:04:53,286 --> 00:04:58,320
and reaches over 11 thousand,
all species included.

80
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,683
Most were bovines

81
00:05:00,883 --> 00:05:03,723
with 39% of observations.

82
00:05:03,923 --> 00:05:05,812
By the way,

83
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:09,628
during this phase,
the number of direct observations

84
00:05:09,828 --> 00:05:12,105
has practically doubled,

85
00:05:12,305 --> 00:05:19,307
going from 282 during 
the previous phase, to 484.

86
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:25,605
Human activities, 
essentially illegal activities,

87
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:28,480
like hunting, mining and so on,

88
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,103
represented only 4%
of recorded observations.

89
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:37,721
But the most encountered 
indicators of human activities

90
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:41,246
were trucks with 300 observations,

91
00:05:41,446 --> 00:05:45,813
traps with 171 observations,

92
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:48,538
and (INAUDIBLE)

93
00:05:48,738 --> 00:05:52,749
with 131 observations.

94
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:54,256
Even though

95
00:05:54,456 --> 00:05:59,024
there were more indicators
of fauna attacks during phase 4,

96
00:05:59,224 --> 00:06:01,744
319 of total observations,

97
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:06,421
the critical encounter rate
of one indicator rate per kilometer,

98
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:07,979
was not reached.

99
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:09,044
Furthermore,

100
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:12,204
the encounter rate
of poaching trails

101
00:06:12,404 --> 00:06:14,535
was reduced by more than half.

102
00:06:14,735 --> 00:06:19,999
And in phase 4,
went from 1.01 per kilometer,

103
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,869
to 0.42 per kilometer.

104
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:24,397
As for traps,

105
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:27,295
their encounter rate
did not change much,

106
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:29,749
but was slowly decreasing.

107
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,279
Going from 0.55 in phase 3,

108
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,680
to 0.47 per kilometer in phase 4.

109
00:06:40,481 --> 00:06:46,676
The analysis of hunting
indicator distribution, however,

110
00:06:46,763 --> 00:06:47,344
shows that

111
00:06:47,381 --> 00:06:48,944
in all phases

112
00:06:48,994 --> 00:06:52,683
there are areas
with higher rates of attacks.

113
00:06:53,247 --> 00:06:55,205
In phase 4,

114
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:56,333
these areas

115
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:59,939
are mainly located
at the periphery of the park.

116
00:06:59,939 --> 00:07:02,213
In all 3 phases,

117
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,490
the research area shows

118
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,557
a very low rate
of hunting indicators,

119
00:07:07,557 --> 00:07:11,692
probably thanks to
regular presence of humans

120
00:07:11,692 --> 00:07:13,791
and to man-made actions

121
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,795
implemented in the park. 

122
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:20,266
Other animals, such as apes,

123
00:07:20,266 --> 00:07:22,771
24% of observations,

124
00:07:22,771 --> 00:07:25,997
and birds, 18% of observations,

125
00:07:25,997 --> 00:07:28,776
were also observed a lot.

126
00:07:28,776 --> 00:07:34,929
But this is not true for elephants,
with only 1% of observations.

127
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:36,581
Either because

128
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:40,725
there are very few individuals
of this species in the park,

129
00:07:40,725 --> 00:07:44,263
or because the monitoring methods

130
00:07:44,263 --> 00:07:48,627
is not useful to assess
its ecological attributes.

131
00:07:49,569 --> 00:07:50,951
To finish off,

132
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:52,509
we can see that

133
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:54,963
over the course
of a couple of years,

134
00:07:54,963 --> 00:07:57,578
the encounter rate of duikers

135
00:07:57,578 --> 00:08:00,466
has been increasing
in the TaÏ National Park

136
00:08:00,466 --> 00:08:05,145
while indicators of attacks
have stabilized or fallen.

137
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,000
These results are undoubtfully 

138
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,387
a result of management decisions

139
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:14,871
that were implemented
to protect the duiker value,

140
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,213
used here

141
00:08:16,213 --> 00:08:19,385
as an example
of all animal populations,

142
00:08:19,385 --> 00:08:24,438
and to reduce the threats
weighing against it.

143
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,941
This would hence
be a demonstration

144
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,974
of the park's success.
