1
00:00:08,731 --> 00:00:11,865
The elephant is one of the most
studied species on the planet,

2
00:00:12,015 --> 00:00:14,352
and there are many
techniques to monitor it.

3
00:00:14,524 --> 00:00:16,515
But let's have a look
at some of them

4
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:19,027
that are useful to guide
management decisions.

5
00:00:19,725 --> 00:00:22,815
The first question the manager
can ask himself

6
00:00:22,988 --> 00:00:25,890
is to know how
the elephant are distributed

7
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:28,090
in and around the protected area,

8
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:30,777
so that he can detect
abnormal movements

9
00:00:30,949 --> 00:00:33,012
caused by entropic pressures.

10
00:00:33,977 --> 00:00:38,415
A common technique to determine
the distribution of elephants

11
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:41,280
consists in studying their tracks,

12
00:00:41,454 --> 00:00:43,655
either droppings or footprints,

13
00:00:43,846 --> 00:00:48,142
in transects spread
over the entire protected area. 

14
00:00:48,903 --> 00:00:50,242
Alternatively,

15
00:00:50,417 --> 00:00:52,827
sampling implications
in space and time

16
00:00:52,988 --> 00:00:54,402
of these transects

17
00:00:54,565 --> 00:00:56,952
allow to get more reliable results

18
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,002
of the real distribution
of the elephants. 

19
00:01:00,803 --> 00:01:05,264
As for the methods using
telemetry or satellite monitoring,

20
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,077
which consists in placing
a tracking collar

21
00:01:08,253 --> 00:01:09,827
on certain key individuals

22
00:01:09,977 --> 00:01:11,589
to monitor their journeys

23
00:01:11,756 --> 00:01:14,352
the signals emitted by the collar

24
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:16,039
are then received by an antenna

25
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:17,402
or a satellite,

26
00:01:17,564 --> 00:01:20,883
that gives the animal's positioning.

27
00:01:21,395 --> 00:01:22,777
So this system

28
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,252
enables direct monitoring
that can be useful

29
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:27,127
when a quick management decision

30
00:01:27,309 --> 00:01:28,310
needs to be made,

31
00:01:28,485 --> 00:01:32,637
when elephants get closer
to populated areas, for instance. 

32
00:01:34,221 --> 00:01:35,821
Especially if those elephants

33
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:38,384
know how to cross
electrified fences,

34
00:01:38,526 --> 00:01:39,796
which draw the limit

35
00:01:39,952 --> 00:01:43,134
between the protected area
and the neighboring communities.

36
00:01:43,325 --> 00:01:46,734
They can then be spotted
early enough to intervene on time,

37
00:01:46,908 --> 00:01:49,360
and prevent
human-elephant conflicts.

38
00:01:50,167 --> 00:01:51,246
On the other hand,

39
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:52,871
knowing the damage rates

40
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,509
done by elephants on certain

41
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:56,659
(INAUDIBLE) forests
of the protected area,

42
00:01:56,805 --> 00:01:58,934
where they are present
in high densities,

43
00:01:59,089 --> 00:02:00,846
will allow to intervene

44
00:02:01,008 --> 00:02:03,633
if this sensitive habitat
needs to be protected.

45
00:02:04,163 --> 00:02:05,408
Even if the cause-effect

46
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:07,171
relationship between elephants

47
00:02:07,254 --> 00:02:09,458
and their habitat
is often hard to establish,

48
00:02:09,541 --> 00:02:11,095
there are simple models though

49
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:12,466
to predict them

50
00:02:12,628 --> 00:02:14,171
and that allow the manager

51
00:02:14,303 --> 00:02:16,658
to simulate the consequences
of interventions,

52
00:02:16,854 --> 00:02:19,096
in order to assess the level of risk

53
00:02:19,224 --> 00:02:21,051
before implementing them.

54
00:02:21,787 --> 00:02:23,083
Such models

55
00:02:23,231 --> 00:02:26,671
have been developed, for example,
for Tsavo, Serengeti,

56
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:28,583
and  Manyara ecosystems,

57
00:02:28,746 --> 00:02:29,898
in east Africa.

58
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:34,183
Thereby, to better manage
these habitats and their threats,

59
00:02:34,343 --> 00:02:36,308
beyond knowing the distribution,

60
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,183
the manager will also need to know
the number of elephants present

61
00:02:40,328 --> 00:02:41,396
in the protected area

62
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:43,033
and their density.

63
00:02:43,504 --> 00:02:45,158
And even the possible evolution

64
00:02:45,346 --> 00:02:47,872
of the resident population
over the years.

65
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:51,621
If the protected area
is in the savannah

66
00:02:51,795 --> 00:02:52,983
you could,
for example,

67
00:02:53,109 --> 00:02:56,096
proceed to aerial
or ground based censuses,

68
00:02:56,253 --> 00:02:58,665
by counting the elephants
on transects.

69
00:02:59,923 --> 00:03:01,483
On this map

70
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:04,521
we see that the aerial count,
done in 2008,

71
00:03:04,696 --> 00:03:07,483
over the Laikipia
and some rural areas in Kenya,

72
00:03:07,635 --> 00:03:09,971
have allowed to identify the zone

73
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:12,777
with the different
densities of elephants.

74
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:15,383
In the protected areas

75
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:18,096
located in the dense forests
in Central Africa,

76
00:03:18,227 --> 00:03:20,546
we stick to ground-based censuses.

77
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:22,929
Or we use capture-recapture method,

78
00:03:23,108 --> 00:03:24,454
by phototraps,

79
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:26,704
or DNA sampling on feces,

80
00:03:26,835 --> 00:03:29,029
and statistical models

81
00:03:29,165 --> 00:03:32,817
then allow to deduce the abundance
and the density of elephants

82
00:03:32,966 --> 00:03:35,999
in the studied zones based
on these data.

83
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:40,067
So knowing the distribution
and the abundance of elephants

84
00:03:40,237 --> 00:03:41,307
is a good start.

85
00:03:41,456 --> 00:03:42,592
But some managers

86
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:44,904
can be willing to go further

87
00:03:45,037 --> 00:03:47,329
and look to detect abnormalities

88
00:03:47,495 --> 00:03:48,998
in the social structures.

89
00:03:49,172 --> 00:03:52,557
Because this can also reveal
management problems to curb.

90
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:55,118
The size of elephant groups,

91
00:03:55,267 --> 00:03:55,935
or families,

92
00:03:56,059 --> 00:03:56,919
can be modified;

93
00:03:57,093 --> 00:03:59,730
because of the suppression
of certain age groups

94
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:02,105
for instance,
because of intensive poaching

95
00:04:02,246 --> 00:04:03,992
targeting old individuals

96
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:05,735
with large tusks.

97
00:04:06,443 --> 00:04:07,167
And of course,

98
00:04:07,272 --> 00:04:10,005
you shouldn't forget to monitor
the threat to elephants

99
00:04:10,127 --> 00:04:11,056
and their habitat,

100
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:14,805
to make sure that management actions
to counter them are effective.

101
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,580
This will be done by assisting
the patrolling efforts

102
00:04:17,718 --> 00:04:18,944
the arrest rates,

103
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:21,408
and following up on prosecutions.

104
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,942
So as we can see
there are multiple methods

105
00:04:25,053 --> 00:04:27,542
to resolve these different
management questions

106
00:04:27,656 --> 00:04:30,742
and they are more or less elaborate
or reliable. 

107
00:04:30,917 --> 00:04:33,742
But it is useless to choose the ones

108
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:37,159
that we know we won't
have the means to implement.

109
00:04:37,496 --> 00:04:40,492
In the case where
the resources are limited,

110
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:43,317
you may only want to focus
your ecological monitoring

111
00:04:43,446 --> 00:04:45,367
on the distribution of elephants

112
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,842
and the threats they face,

113
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:49,817
because this already gives
a lot of key information

114
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,937
to protect the elephants.
