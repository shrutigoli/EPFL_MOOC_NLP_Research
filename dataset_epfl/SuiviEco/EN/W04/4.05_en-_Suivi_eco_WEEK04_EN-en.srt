1
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:18,544
Marine protected areas

2
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:20,335
are specific ecosystems

3
00:00:20,535 --> 00:00:23,708
involving both land and sea.

4
00:00:23,908 --> 00:00:25,828
And their ecological monitoring

5
00:00:26,028 --> 00:00:29,454
is a reflection of this specificity.

6
00:00:30,008 --> 00:00:31,629
We will use the example

7
00:00:31,829 --> 00:00:33,825
of Aldabra island,

8
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:35,873
in the Indian Ocean. 

9
00:00:36,773 --> 00:00:38,674
Aldabra is an atoll

10
00:00:38,874 --> 00:00:40,450
in the Seychelles, 

11
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:42,465
located north of Madagascar,

12
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:44,697
in the middle of the Indian Ocean.

13
00:00:45,297 --> 00:00:48,815
It covers around
350 square kilometers,

14
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:52,107
but it is mainly 
comprised of a lagoon,

15
00:00:52,307 --> 00:00:53,691
of which two-thirds

16
00:00:53,891 --> 00:00:56,732
are emerged during low tide.

17
00:00:56,932 --> 00:00:59,176
The island is managed 

18
00:00:59,376 --> 00:01:01,261
by the Seychelles Island Foundation,

19
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,988
and does not have any inhabitants

20
00:01:05,188 --> 00:01:06,641
except for some researchers

21
00:01:06,841 --> 00:01:08,638
in the research station,

22
00:01:08,838 --> 00:01:10,877
that is shown on the screen.

23
00:01:11,077 --> 00:01:15,026
Aldabra has incredible
biological diversity.

24
00:01:15,226 --> 00:01:20,505
Over 100 thousand giant tortoises 
stay there.

25
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:22,469
You see one here.

26
00:01:22,669 --> 00:01:26,318
It is one of the biggest
egg-laying sites

27
00:01:26,518 --> 00:01:29,837
for Indian Ocean's turtles.

28
00:01:30,037 --> 00:01:31,403
It is also a home 

29
00:01:31,603 --> 00:01:33,051
to many seabirds colonies

30
00:01:33,251 --> 00:01:34,828
and animal species,

31
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:37,043
such as Aldbra rail.

32
00:01:37,243 --> 00:01:38,230
But also,

33
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:40,035
to the region's vast population

34
00:01:40,135 --> 00:01:40,935
of manatee.

35
00:01:41,135 --> 00:01:42,493
The coral reef

36
00:01:42,693 --> 00:01:44,778
attracts exceptional 

37
00:01:44,978 --> 00:01:46,408
underwater fauna.

38
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:47,960
All these elements

39
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:49,430
have led the island

40
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,960
to becoming 
a UNESCO World Heritage Site,

41
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:54,884
in 1982.

42
00:01:55,084 --> 00:01:56,893
Though the ecological monitoring

43
00:01:56,968 --> 00:01:59,189
focuses on 
the atoll's different values,

44
00:01:59,389 --> 00:02:00,104
of course,

45
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:02,172
and there are many of them.

46
00:02:02,372 --> 00:02:04,731
It requires expert knowledge

47
00:02:04,931 --> 00:02:06,325
in different fields.

48
00:02:06,525 --> 00:02:08,869
Monitoring tortoises

49
00:02:09,069 --> 00:02:13,270
focuses on different 
aspects of the population.

50
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:15,066
The number of individuals

51
00:02:15,266 --> 00:02:16,329
is determined by

52
00:02:16,529 --> 00:02:19,193
traveling over 
12 permanent transects

53
00:02:19,303 --> 00:02:21,038
at regular intervals.

54
00:02:21,238 --> 00:02:23,469
The population is today

55
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:25,218
considered stable.

56
00:02:25,418 --> 00:02:28,166
The ecology of these tortoises,

57
00:02:28,366 --> 00:02:29,941
is assessed by

58
00:02:30,141 --> 00:02:34,697
specifically monitoring hundreds
of identified individuals,

59
00:02:34,897 --> 00:02:36,952
by marking their shells

60
00:02:37,152 --> 00:02:40,610
which also allows determining
their lifespan.

61
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:41,865
Their movements

62
00:02:42,065 --> 00:02:45,815
are monitored thanks 
to GPS microchips,

63
00:02:46,015 --> 00:02:48,069
placed on some tortoises.

64
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:50,836
And their impact on the environment

65
00:02:51,036 --> 00:02:53,917
is assessed by the protection
of certain plots,

66
00:02:54,117 --> 00:02:56,489
where you can measure
the growth of vegetation

67
00:02:56,689 --> 00:02:59,124
in absence of tortoises.

68
00:02:59,324 --> 00:03:01,897
Turtles are subject

69
00:03:02,097 --> 00:03:03,783
to a similar approach.

70
00:03:03,983 --> 00:03:05,551
Egg-layings are recorded

71
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:09,122
at night on clearly defined
beach areas,

72
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:11,026
which allows for evaluating

73
00:03:11,226 --> 00:03:12,948
their evolution over time.

74
00:03:13,148 --> 00:03:17,146
Over 500% 
in the past 40 years.

75
00:03:17,346 --> 00:03:19,334
Some turtles are also collared

76
00:03:19,534 --> 00:03:22,135
or monitored 
by satellite microchips,

77
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:25,140
which gives information

78
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,157
about their overall dispersion 
in the Indian Ocean

79
00:03:28,357 --> 00:03:30,630
when they move away from the atoll.

80
00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:33,283
And about their survival rate also.

81
00:03:33,483 --> 00:03:34,807
Seabirds colonies

82
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,511
their nests, the number of chicks,

83
00:03:37,711 --> 00:03:39,766
are surveyed each year

84
00:03:39,966 --> 00:03:42,337
which gives us 
the number of seabirds,

85
00:03:42,537 --> 00:03:44,229
the condition of the population,

86
00:03:44,429 --> 00:03:48,820
the fluctuations linked 
to food availability,

87
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:49,727
et cetera.

88
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:54,678
Aldabra has become 
the second largest colony on earth

89
00:03:54,878 --> 00:03:56,415
for frigate birds.

90
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:59,096
And this statement can be made

91
00:03:59,296 --> 00:04:00,854
thanks to precise knowledge

92
00:04:01,054 --> 00:04:03,820
obtained by monitoring the colonies.

93
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:07,020
Seabirds are also monitored
when moving.

94
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:08,307
For example,

95
00:04:08,507 --> 00:04:10,861
microchips arrose

96
00:04:11,061 --> 00:04:13,835
for monitoring 
the red-tailed trumpet birds,

97
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:15,778
that reproduce in Aldabra

98
00:04:15,978 --> 00:04:17,564
and will wander off

99
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:20,387
several thousand kilometers away

100
00:04:20,587 --> 00:04:23,454
before coming back 
to the original site. 

101
00:04:23,654 --> 00:04:25,234
Some (INAUDIBLE) species,

102
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:26,803
like the Aldabra rail

103
00:04:27,003 --> 00:04:29,760
can be subject 
to targeted monitoring

104
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,254
through regular 
surveys and collaring

105
00:04:32,454 --> 00:04:34,984
to assess movements
or survival rates.

106
00:04:35,934 --> 00:04:37,497
Eliminating cats,

107
00:04:37,697 --> 00:04:39,772
previously introduced
onto the island,

108
00:04:39,972 --> 00:04:42,859
has allowed to restore 
the rail population,

109
00:04:43,059 --> 00:04:45,755
and monitoring showed
the progression rate

110
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:47,794
in numbers and distribution.

111
00:04:47,994 --> 00:04:49,900
Monitoring invasive species

112
00:04:49,938 --> 00:04:53,082
is an essential part 
of the atoll management.

113
00:04:53,282 --> 00:04:55,822
This has allowed taking
the suitable measures

114
00:04:56,022 --> 00:04:58,564
to get rid of cats and goats

115
00:04:58,764 --> 00:05:01,281
introduced almost a century ago.

116
00:05:01,481 --> 00:05:03,337
And more recently,

117
00:05:03,399 --> 00:05:04,588
to deal with the rats

118
00:05:04,626 --> 00:05:07,010
brought in by visiting navigators.

119
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:08,696
Monitoring invaders

120
00:05:08,896 --> 00:05:10,900
is, today, above all, preventive 

121
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:14,093
and consists in detecting
new species that can present

122
00:05:14,293 --> 00:05:15,806
a local risk.

123
00:05:16,006 --> 00:05:16,991
And in this case,

124
00:05:17,191 --> 00:05:20,323
suspicions will immediately 
be eliminated.

125
00:05:20,523 --> 00:05:23,621
This requires a permanent watch

126
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:25,571
ensured by civilian staff

127
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:29,228
during patrols conducted
for this purpose 

128
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:31,200
in a systematic way.

129
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,922
For example,

130
00:05:33,122 --> 00:05:34,601
Malagasy sparrows,

131
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:39,531
arrived from the neighboring island 
of Assomption in 2012,

132
00:05:39,731 --> 00:05:41,056
during a storm.

133
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:43,850
They were detected then eradicated

134
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,339
because they were 
presenting a threat

135
00:05:46,539 --> 00:05:48,899
to the survival,
or the purity,

136
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:50,977
of the endemic Aldabra sparrow,

137
00:05:51,177 --> 00:05:52,946
the one we see here. 

138
00:05:53,146 --> 00:05:56,146
This ecological watch,

139
00:05:56,346 --> 00:05:59,333
carefully organized and conducted,

140
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:01,276
has other virtues.

141
00:06:01,476 --> 00:06:04,126
It has namely allowed to rediscover

142
00:06:04,326 --> 00:06:07,549
a snail species
that was thought to be extinct

143
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:09,787
since 2007.

144
00:06:09,987 --> 00:06:11,340
Therefore,

145
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:13,658
carefully monitoring an environment

146
00:06:13,858 --> 00:06:16,304
can give information 
on the ecosystem

147
00:06:16,504 --> 00:06:19,167
far beyond the goals initially set.

148
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:22,900
When, for example, 
it allows discovering

149
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:25,197
or rediscovering

150
00:06:25,397 --> 00:06:27,206
an unknown species.

151
00:06:27,406 --> 00:06:29,006
The maritime environment

152
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:31,509
is of course also 
subject to monitoring.

153
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:34,462
The entire coral reef of the island

154
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,625


155
00:06:34,662 --> 00:06:38,043
has been mapped to enable
detailed monitoring.

156
00:06:38,243 --> 00:06:40,885
Monitoring the underwater fauna

157
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:43,715
is done during 
regular diving sessions,

158
00:06:43,915 --> 00:06:46,792
but also via immersed cameras

159
00:06:46,992 --> 00:06:50,885
that allow for the distance 
surveillance of 12 control sites.

160
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,429
Surveying fish species

161
00:06:53,629 --> 00:06:56,337
(INAUDIBLE) is done to detect

162
00:06:56,537 --> 00:06:59,537
evolving tendencies 
of the ecosystem.

163
00:06:59,737 --> 00:07:00,630
All this

164
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:04,336
gives information 
on the condition of the reef,

165
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:06,415
and allows for further monitoring

166
00:07:06,615 --> 00:07:11,501
of evolutions linked to the increase
of the ocean temperature, 

167
00:07:11,576 --> 00:07:12,581
for instance.

168
00:07:13,194 --> 00:07:15,157
The large sea mammals

169
00:07:15,357 --> 00:07:17,348
are also spotted from the coast

170
00:07:17,548 --> 00:07:21,247
and the frequency 
of their visits is monitored.

171
00:07:21,447 --> 00:07:24,447
Ecological monitoring of Aldabra

172
00:07:24,647 --> 00:07:27,105
combines the classic 
monitoring approach

173
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:30,727
that is regular, organized,
and so and so,

174
00:07:29,904 --> 00:07:30,727


175
00:07:30,927 --> 00:07:33,663
to research that will help answer

176
00:07:33,863 --> 00:07:37,103
the questions raised by monitoring.

177
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:41,474
This leads to the exceptional
management of the atoll,

178
00:07:41,674 --> 00:07:44,781
and confirms the utility 
of adaptive management

179
00:07:44,981 --> 00:07:46,751
based on good knowledge

180
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:48,325
of the environment. 

181
00:07:48,525 --> 00:07:50,241
This knowledge is possible

182
00:07:50,441 --> 00:07:54,943
thanks to the structured
ecological monitoring plan.

183
00:07:55,968 --> 00:07:58,709
A big part of monitoring

184
00:07:58,909 --> 00:08:01,079
is purely forward looking

185
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,417
and aims at keeping any form

186
00:08:03,617 --> 00:08:05,538
of invasive species

187
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:08,330
or other problems from appearing.

188
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:09,846
In this respect,

189
00:08:10,046 --> 00:08:14,007
Aldabra is absolutely remarkable.
