00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:12,829
In this module, we've seen
what ecological monitoring 

2
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:16,332
a protected area means
and that it intends 

3
00:00:16,505 --> 00:00:20,480
to asses the state 
of the territory's values. 

4
00:00:20,685 --> 00:00:24,072
These values are characterized 
by ecological attributes 

5
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:26,396
which are described by indicators. 

6
00:00:26,585 --> 00:00:28,747
Ecological monitoring 
follows a protocol 

7
00:00:28,951 --> 00:00:31,788
that specifies assembly plan 
and approach to use. 

8
00:00:31,994 --> 00:00:36,307
So, let's summarize the steps
to follow to implement 

9
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:38,417
ecological monitoring. 

10
00:00:38,617 --> 00:00:41,654
First off, you need to identify
the values to monitor,

11
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:44,841
the ones that matter to the 
management  of the protected area

12
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:48,713
 and that could be part of a 
sensible ecological monitoring plan.

13
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:52,283
It can be an animal species 
or an ecosystem 

14
00:00:52,477 --> 00:00:55,565
within the protected area,
for instance.

15
00:00:55,738 --> 00:00:58,663
You then determine 
the key ecological attributes. 

16
00:00:58,874 --> 00:01:02,025
The one that will characterize 
the value and help understand

17
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:04,144
the state of the protected area,

18
00:01:04,341 --> 00:01:07,916
the density of the species 
that is being monitored for instance

19
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:11,174
or it's population dynamics 

20
00:01:11,378 --> 00:01:16,615
or even original floral composition
of the chosen ecosystem. 

21
00:01:17,443 --> 00:01:20,443
It is generally useful 
to specify some indicators 

22
00:01:20,692 --> 00:01:24,605
easily measurable to express
these ecological attributes. 

23
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:28,509
In other words, the number 
of individuals 

24
00:01:28,725 --> 00:01:31,988
of the targeted species, 
the age distribution, 

25
00:01:32,184 --> 00:01:35,934
or even the presence or absence 
of invasive species 

26
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:38,431
within the ecosystem. 

27
00:01:39,566 --> 00:01:43,016
The next step consist of identifying
the acceptable limits 

28
00:01:43,191 --> 00:01:46,367
within which the 
ecological attributes may vary. 

29
00:01:47,362 --> 00:01:49,962
The limit between 
a healthy attribute and one 

30
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:52,744
that requires intervention.

31
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:56,622
An example is to set the minimal 
number of individuals 

32
00:01:56,848 --> 00:02:01,123
that indicates the endangerment 
of the species or on the other hand,

33
00:02:01,336 --> 00:02:06,211
a maximum number that implies 
an excessive number of individuals 

34
00:02:06,379 --> 00:02:09,742
that puts the ecosystem at risk. 

35
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:14,598
Then come the choice in method
to measure these indicators 

36
00:02:14,809 --> 00:02:16,885
which would of course 
take into account 

37
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,395
the monetary values 
but also the capabilities 

38
00:02:19,592 --> 00:02:23,930
of the protected area itself 
in terms of means and skills.

39
00:02:25,398 --> 00:02:29,348
You can either choose to directly
count the animals 

40
00:02:29,556 --> 00:02:33,006
or indirectly by monitoring tracks 
for example,

41
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:36,546
these decisions should be based
on the context 

42
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:40,766
in which you work and the results
you hope to obtain. 

43
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,132
Well, the approach as in, you need 
to draw up the sampling plan

44
00:02:46,327 --> 00:02:49,727
that will ensure obtained results
will be as usable, precise,

45
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:51,510
and correct as possible. 

46
00:02:51,765 --> 00:02:54,877
You can then proceed to counting
all the individuals

47
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:57,825
 near water point
if the species is localized 

48
00:02:58,016 --> 00:03:02,503
or on the other hand, assembling 
10% or 20% of the park

49
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:05,669
if the species 
is spread out equally. 

50
00:03:05,862 --> 00:03:09,562
For instance, monitoring invasive
plant species is done 

51
00:03:09,747 --> 00:03:13,047
by counting the new stems 
in random transects. 

52
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:16,756
And then collect the data 
according to the chosen method

53
00:03:16,979 --> 00:03:18,579
and sampling plan. 

54
00:03:18,792 --> 00:03:22,629
What maters in this step
is to follow drawer pools 

55
00:03:22,828 --> 00:03:25,503
and to do the work
with precision. 

56
00:03:25,736 --> 00:03:29,049
If you don't, you give way 
to an acceptable bias

57
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,210
for the data processing.

58
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:34,254
And the data collected
should be stored 

59
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:38,231
and remain available for future use
because they guarantee 

60
00:03:38,472 --> 00:03:41,722
the truthfulness and the reliability
of the monitoring. 

61
00:03:42,654 --> 00:03:45,717
They especially ensure 
that another user

62
00:03:45,899 --> 00:03:50,449
will obtain the same result 
later on with the same data. 

63
00:03:51,037 --> 00:03:53,775
Exactly, and this data 
will then be analyzed 

64
00:03:53,993 --> 00:03:57,868
and the obtained result will be
transformed into information. 

65
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:03,654
Thereby, the animal account 
is rendered into a density 

66
00:04:03,873 --> 00:04:07,773
in the park, which can then 
be compared to a non-standard 

67
00:04:07,991 --> 00:04:11,541
for this kind of ecosystem
and the species. 

68
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,060
At this point, and according 
to the  determined monitoring goals,

69
00:04:16,263 --> 00:04:19,626
you should get an idea of the
 monitoring values condition now.

70
00:04:20,562 --> 00:04:23,962
For instance, the questions around 
invasive plant species,

71
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:27,175
we started a discussion, should now
be answered;

72
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:29,419
what species are present, 

73
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:33,919
how many, where, 
offers do they present, et cetera. 

74
00:04:34,753 --> 00:04:37,953
And depending these health condition
and the predefined limits 

75
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:40,820
for the attributes
we have defined before, 

76
00:04:41,004 --> 00:04:43,679
the decision will be made 
and actions put into place

77
00:04:43,899 --> 00:04:46,674
to maintain protected area 
in a good condition

78
00:04:46,915 --> 00:04:49,027
or on the other hand, 
restore an attribute 

79
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:51,317
that may have been damaged.

80
00:04:51,508 --> 00:04:56,108
If animals become too scarce, 
we would, for example, 

81
00:04:56,317 --> 00:04:59,442
need to change the strategy 
and the fights against poaching,

82
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:00,887
if we have one.

83
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:04,436
If the environment is invaded 
by an invasive plant species,

84
00:05:04,624 --> 00:05:08,074
you change the rate 
of fire ignition or you proceed 

85
00:05:08,295 --> 00:05:10,045
to manual extraction. 

86
00:05:11,064 --> 00:05:14,189
And all these needs to be repeated 
as often as needed,

87
00:05:14,406 --> 00:05:18,093
to feed the decision making process 
of adoptive management,

88
00:05:18,285 --> 00:05:21,672
because the monitoring is in fact 
just the part of a larger cycle

89
00:05:21,926 --> 00:05:23,801
that it tends to manage 
the territory 

90
00:05:23,984 --> 00:05:25,959
in the best way as possible.
