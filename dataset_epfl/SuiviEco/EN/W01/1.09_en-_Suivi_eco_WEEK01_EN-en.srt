1
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:12,327
For each value of 
the protected area, 

2
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:16,576
ecological monitoring protocols 
are drawn up and together 

3
00:00:16,814 --> 00:00:21,776
they form the global 
monitoring program of the territory.

4
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:25,217
The only thing left to do
is to implement them. 

5
00:00:25,461 --> 00:00:28,348
The staff in charge will collect, 
store and analyze the data

6
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:32,332
throughout the year following 
this established scheduled. 

7
00:00:32,552 --> 00:00:36,427
You need to make sure though 
that the psychological monitoring

8
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:38,858
remains consistent overtime,

9
00:00:39,075 --> 00:00:42,300
meaning that the collected data
will be comparable 

10
00:00:42,472 --> 00:00:46,835
from one collection campaign 
to another over several years. 

11
00:00:47,618 --> 00:00:51,331
This quality control is facilitated 
by the creation of a clear 

12
00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:55,923
technical manual that guarantees 
the compatibility of data 

13
00:00:56,196 --> 00:00:59,759
and the repeat-ability 
of the used approaches overtime. 

14
00:01:00,524 --> 00:01:04,049
This technical manual should 
describe in detail

15
00:01:04,238 --> 00:01:05,562
all the protocols.

16
00:01:05,789 --> 00:01:09,989
In other words, it tracks the data 
from when they are collected 

17
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:11,932
up to the analysis. 

18
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:15,239
It guides the ecological monitoring.

19
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:19,644
Thus, any kind of variation
from this manual, 

20
00:01:19,858 --> 00:01:22,745
be it connected to observers 
or to the method used, 

21
00:01:22,968 --> 00:01:26,430
is to be recorded overtime 
in this manual and then 

22
00:01:26,624 --> 00:01:29,512
incorporated to the results 
of statistic test. 

23
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:33,541
The manual should first describe 
how the data 

24
00:01:33,796 --> 00:01:36,246
will be recorded in the field. 

25
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:39,066
There are several option available
on the paper form, 

26
00:01:39,289 --> 00:01:41,777
through a recording tool as 
symbol through that

27
00:01:41,954 --> 00:01:45,966
we can see it there, 
or a smart phone application. 

28
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:50,162
The choice depends on the quality 
of information together, 

29
00:01:50,783 --> 00:01:53,858
on the means at hand, 
and what would be 

30
00:01:54,069 --> 00:01:57,081
the most practical tool 
for staff in the field. 

31
00:01:57,309 --> 00:02:00,672
This is why it is very important 
for the users to test 

32
00:02:00,856 --> 00:02:03,257
the chosen tool first. 

33
00:02:03,489 --> 00:02:06,327
For instance in conservancy 
around Maasai Mara in Kenya, 

34
00:02:06,506 --> 00:02:08,593
several connection tool 
have been tested;

35
00:02:08,788 --> 00:02:13,825
phone like a smartphone app 
as well as a smart tool

36
00:02:14,026 --> 00:02:17,576
and the rangers after having 
tested all these tools 

37
00:02:17,765 --> 00:02:19,926
have finally chosen 
the smart phone app

38
00:02:20,114 --> 00:02:22,826
as being the easiest one to use 
in the field to collect 

39
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,557
and store all the data. 

40
00:02:24,775 --> 00:02:29,475
Then the manual should state 
how the data needs to be stored. 

41
00:02:29,699 --> 00:02:33,261
There are two important criteria 
to consider here.

42
00:02:33,475 --> 00:02:36,825
The first, you need an easy to use 
database that allow 

43
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:40,303
to easily extract the data 
to analyze. 

44
00:02:40,504 --> 00:02:43,028
Microsoft Access for instance 
is a good example

45
00:02:43,226 --> 00:02:47,163
of a simple database that enables
the heavy handling 

46
00:02:47,377 --> 00:02:51,014
of data for different types 
of analysis. 

47
00:02:51,247 --> 00:02:54,110
And then excel sheets 
are even easier to use

48
00:02:54,298 --> 00:02:57,760
and offer better options 
to process the digital data

49
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,283
and they are also easy 
to transport to statistical software

50
00:03:01,489 --> 00:03:04,189
or GIA software for special data. 

51
00:03:05,055 --> 00:03:08,593
I know the key element is that, 
the data, need to persist 

52
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,214
over several years. 

53
00:03:10,474 --> 00:03:13,124
It is therefore crucial 
to do backups 

54
00:03:13,365 --> 00:03:15,552
on the next day on our drive 
for instance, 

55
00:03:15,763 --> 00:03:20,051
and to secure the database 
to avoid losing the information.

56
00:03:20,719 --> 00:03:24,094
And a good solution for this
is to appoint one person

57
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:27,433
responsible for the database 
to make sure it is updated 

58
00:03:27,676 --> 00:03:31,038
and that everything works, 
and the other users 

59
00:03:31,226 --> 00:03:33,401
will be able to access 
the database of course, 

60
00:03:33,602 --> 00:03:37,077
but only to conceal the data 
and not to edit it. 

61
00:03:37,267 --> 00:03:40,492
Obviously, creating 
and maintaining a database 

62
00:03:40,688 --> 00:03:44,038
is not an earning itself, 
we have the data 

63
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:47,568
but who will analyze them 
and when?

64
00:03:47,784 --> 00:03:50,409
To often the data piles up
and nobody uses it, 

65
00:03:50,584 --> 00:03:53,671
so the manual also need to say
who will do what and when. 

66
00:03:54,821 --> 00:03:57,633
Let's remember that 
analyzing the data

67
00:03:57,832 --> 00:04:01,619
for ecological monitoring 
needs to enable comparing the data

68
00:04:01,819 --> 00:04:04,619
of a sample at a predefined 
thresholds 

69
00:04:04,796 --> 00:04:08,384
like the threshold of viability 
of a species for instance. 

70
00:04:09,067 --> 00:04:12,017
Also to compare the data 
of a collected sample 

71
00:04:12,202 --> 00:04:15,065
at different point in time,
to see if there are 

72
00:04:15,281 --> 00:04:18,744
any notable variation over time 
in this same sample. 

73
00:04:18,965 --> 00:04:22,578
The analysis usually implies 
using hypothesis test

74
00:04:22,803 --> 00:04:26,428
and confidence intervals 
which are detailed in this module 

75
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:29,360
in the session on statistics.

76
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:31,888
Hypothesis test will allow 
for instance 

77
00:04:32,117 --> 00:04:35,642
to show that they're may or may not 
have been some sort of variation

78
00:04:35,867 --> 00:04:37,492
in partly the entire population. 

79
00:04:37,714 --> 00:04:40,839
However, this information is often
of limited interest 

80
00:04:41,062 --> 00:04:43,474
because we know 
that there will be variations 

81
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:47,109
due to the dynamic nature of the
animal population and habitats.

82
00:04:48,526 --> 00:04:52,688
What is more interesting 
is finding out how important 

83
00:04:52,911 --> 00:04:58,398
this variation is, and if it is, 
let's say, ecologically significant.

84
00:04:58,994 --> 00:05:03,144
This is where confidence intervals 
are useful to describe the normal 

85
00:05:03,343 --> 00:05:06,681
or abnormal variation range. 

86
00:05:07,657 --> 00:05:11,170
Let's keep in mind that the use 
of inadequate statistic test 

87
00:05:11,374 --> 00:05:14,024
or neglecting some biases 
in the analysis 

88
00:05:14,198 --> 00:05:17,160
can lead to serious mistakes
and interpretation. 

89
00:05:17,364 --> 00:05:20,726
The person in-charge of 
analyzing the data  should therefore

90
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:23,503
have good knowledge on statistics.

91
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:27,058
He needs, he or she, 
needs to be around to measure 

92
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:29,524
the possible biases 
particularly well. 

93
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:34,586
Finally, once the data has been
described and analyzed, 

94
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:38,230
the results have to be interpreted
and presented clearly. 

95
00:05:39,115 --> 00:05:42,165
Strangely enough, this step 
is often the longest 

96
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:43,812
and the most complicated. 

97
00:05:44,859 --> 00:05:48,272
Because, let's not forget 
that the results 

98
00:05:48,482 --> 00:05:51,344
need to meet the objectives 
for which the monitoring 

99
00:05:51,524 --> 00:05:52,811
has been set up. 

100
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:56,761
Namely, informing 
the decision makers on the state 

101
00:05:56,994 --> 00:05:59,707
of the protected area's values. 

102
00:06:00,343 --> 00:06:02,481
Thus, the quality 
of ecological monitoring 

103
00:06:02,686 --> 00:06:05,274
is also measured by it's capacity
to be understood 

104
00:06:05,482 --> 00:06:08,445
by the decision makers and thereby, 
to guide the management 

105
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:11,733
of the protected area 
to changing the management practices

106
00:06:11,939 --> 00:06:05,839
where it's needed. 

107
00:06:13,642 --> 00:06:16,705
An interesting example 
are the maps 

108
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:19,848
from the geographic 
information system that easily 

109
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:23,655
convey the evolution and the 
distribution of certain species

110
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:27,458
present in the protected area 
overtime,

111
00:06:27,665 --> 00:06:30,977
allowing thereby, 
pragmatic decision making. 

112
00:06:31,685 --> 00:06:34,560
And we can see on this one,
the distribution of some wild life

113
00:06:34,772 --> 00:06:37,297
in a park in Cameroon, 
of the Cameroon.
