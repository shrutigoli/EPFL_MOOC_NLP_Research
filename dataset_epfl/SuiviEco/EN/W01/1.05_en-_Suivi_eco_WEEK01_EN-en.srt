1
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:11,969
We already saw the role
of ecological monitoring

2
00:00:12,144 --> 00:00:16,631
in a particular area  is to get 
information on its value condition

3
00:00:16,838 --> 00:00:19,864
and thereby to asses the impact 
of management actions 

4
00:00:20,027 --> 00:00:21,602
of these values over time.

5
00:00:22,502 --> 00:00:27,989
For instance, in Ol Kinyei,
a conservancy in Kenya

6
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:33,820
one of the values is the migration
of wildebeest from the mountain

7
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:36,600
to the nearby Mara ecosystem.

8
00:00:36,778 --> 00:00:39,816
This is a value that matches
 a single species:

9
00:00:40,023 --> 00:00:41,198
the wildebeest.

10
00:00:42,172 --> 00:00:46,473
In the same conservancy, 
another value is the Acacia forest

11
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,863
that we can see here
and this time, the value matches

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,917
a habitat as a whole.

13
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:55,334
It is clear that monitoring 
these two values 

14
00:00:55,525 --> 00:00:57,462
 calls on different criteria.

15
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:01,590
This is why we will look at 
which criteria

16
00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:03,431
 can characterize the values.

17
00:01:03,641 --> 00:01:08,704
This is what we call
 key ecological attributes.

18
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:11,891
A key ecological attribute 
is shaped 

19
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:15,087
by the vital characteristics 
of a value's ecology.

20
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:19,199
. By identifying these attributes
 you can describe the value 

21
00:01:19,384 --> 00:01:21,021
and measure its viability.

22
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:25,537
Ecological attributes are based 
on some fundamental

23
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,657
 ecological concepts.

24
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:31,218
To make it simple, 
we can say that there are 3

25
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,789
main categories
of ecological attributes

26
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:38,971
which characterize species
and their habitat.

27
00:01:40,014 --> 00:01:42,989
The first one is the size
of the natural habitat

28
00:01:43,147 --> 00:01:47,097
or the abundance of the 
considered value  under territory. 

29
00:01:47,296 --> 00:01:49,622
For instance, the number
of elephants present 

30
00:01:49,802 --> 00:01:52,164
In the Maasai Mara Reserve.

31
00:01:52,335 --> 00:01:55,860
The condition of the value,
the structure of the population

32
00:01:56,085 --> 00:01:59,497
and the interactions
 that exist between individuals

33
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:03,705
such as the compatibility between
the number of predators 

34
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,088
 and the density of preys
 within a park.

35
00:02:07,998 --> 00:02:10,911
Finally, the context in which
the value involves.

36
00:02:11,509 --> 00:02:13,709
This includes
 the ecological processes 

37
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,953
that can contribute to maintaining
 the presence of this value

38
00:02:17,176 --> 00:02:20,689
such as the flood, the pond, 
the fire regime, or the connectivity

39
00:02:20,881 --> 00:02:24,056
for species moving 
from one habitat to another.

40
00:02:25,543 --> 00:02:28,506
After having identified 
the ecological attributes,

41
00:02:28,691 --> 00:02:31,903
for each value, you simply need
 to determine

42
00:02:32,119 --> 00:02:36,695
which ones are key for its survival
in the long run

43
00:02:36,875 --> 00:02:39,250
and consequently important 
to include 

44
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:43,246
in the ecological monitoring
 process.

45
00:02:43,435 --> 00:02:47,672
Taking the example of a tree,
the best way to check its health

46
00:02:47,884 --> 00:02:50,984
will be by assessing the numbers
of flowers produced per year

47
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:52,791
rather than looking at its size

48
00:02:52,944 --> 00:02:55,069
because it can grow slowly actually.

49
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:59,832
But even if these attributes
 are describing the values

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,650
they are often too vague 
to be assessed 

51
00:03:02,859 --> 00:03:06,096
effectively and at low cost.

52
00:03:06,291 --> 00:03:08,966
Hence the necessity
 to define indicators 

53
00:03:09,175 --> 00:03:12,075
that will give us information
regarding the state 

54
00:03:12,221 --> 00:03:14,695
of the attributes over time.

55
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,769
So roughly, 

56
00:03:16,966 --> 00:03:19,378
an indicator can be a measurable
characteristic 

57
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:22,384
of the ecological attribute, 
for example,

58
00:03:22,551 --> 00:03:26,277
the total number of adults
of a population of impalas.

59
00:03:26,442 --> 00:03:29,030
This indicator can also
 be an aggregation

60
00:03:29,143 --> 00:03:32,630
 of several characteristics
of an attribute 

61
00:03:32,832 --> 00:03:34,782
combined n only one index.

62
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:38,689
For example, the evolution 
of a forest's canopy,

63
00:03:38,888 --> 00:03:41,175
the top of the trees 
can be measured 

64
00:03:41,361 --> 00:03:44,074
by the number of species 
encountered.

65
00:03:44,777 --> 00:03:47,739
So, choosing a good indicator
to characterize 

66
00:03:47,893 --> 00:03:50,893
the ecological attributes
is key to the success

67
00:03:51,071 --> 00:03:53,970
of the monitoring, 
this isn't an easy task though.

68
00:03:54,191 --> 00:03:57,567
So let's list some elements 
to defining a good indicator: 

69
00:03:58,753 --> 00:04:04,314
They need to be measurable,
in a quantitative or qualitative way

70
00:04:04,502 --> 00:04:10,178
by procedures giving reliable, 
repeatable and precise information.

71
00:04:11,008 --> 00:04:13,459
They need to be predictable 
over time, meaning

72
00:04:13,647 --> 00:04:17,622
the indicator should have the same
meaning for everybody at all times.

73
00:04:19,127 --> 00:04:24,253
They should be specific,
so the indicator is always 

74
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:27,330
associated with said 
ecological attribute

75
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:29,459
in a non-ambiguous way, 

76
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,077
and is not affected 
by other factors.

77
00:04:33,062 --> 00:04:37,287
The indicator has to be noticeable
should vary significantly

78
00:04:37,465 --> 00:04:42,554
in response to the variations 
of the threats or actions we engage.

79
00:04:42,725 --> 00:04:44,750
to conserve it. 

80
00:04:44,906 --> 00:04:47,906
It has to be swift 
and able to rapidly detect

81
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:51,363
the changes
of the ecological attribute 

82
00:04:51,529 --> 00:04:54,966
so that taking the appropriate
 management measures 

83
00:04:55,134 --> 00:04:57,384
on time is possible.

84
00:04:58,633 --> 00:05:03,109
It needs to be easy to collect 
and not require several operators 

85
00:05:03,278 --> 00:05:07,602
or pricey materials, in the best
 cost-effective way of course.

86
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:12,689
Finally, it should facilitate 
the communication of results, 

87
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:18,588
and therefore be easy to understand
 in order to allow the public

88
00:05:18,761 --> 00:05:21,472
to better get the situation 
of the protected area 

89
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:23,590
through its attributes.

90
00:05:24,748 --> 00:05:28,598
Once the indicator is identified, 
the first step will be to determine 

91
00:05:28,756 --> 00:05:32,406
its current state which will serve 
as baseline condition.

92
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:37,137
Then, define the desired state
 you want to achieve 

93
00:05:37,318 --> 00:05:39,104
for this indicator. 

94
00:05:40,104 --> 00:05:43,092
This will enable the analysis
of results 

95
00:05:43,307 --> 00:05:46,969
of the ecological monitoring
in view of the baseline condition 

96
00:05:47,156 --> 00:05:49,681
of the values,
and the conservation goals

97
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,038
or for each of them.

98
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:54,873
Obviously, there will be 
a certain fluctuation 

99
00:05:55,066 --> 00:05:58,729
of the indicators
within an acceptable area.

100
00:05:58,916 --> 00:06:03,166
This is what we call the acceptable 
level of variation of indicators. 

101
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,802
Thanks to these variation
 thresholds, 

102
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:09,653
we can determine what managers
deem to be the normal level 

103
00:06:09,855 --> 00:06:12,155
of change of the considered value, 

104
00:06:12,344 --> 00:06:15,344
and thereby to define what level
of alteration 

105
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:18,660
of the ecological attribute 
will be deemed too severe 

106
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:20,858
and need an action plan then.

107
00:06:21,077 --> 00:06:22,827
The acceptable level of variation

108
00:06:23,044 --> 00:06:25,720
also defines the level 
of restoration 

109
00:06:25,912 --> 00:06:28,776
of the ecological attribute 
when needed.

110
00:06:29,931 --> 00:06:32,207
As you can see, it's rather simple.

111
00:06:32,363 --> 00:06:34,726
The steps to follow are first 
to identify 

112
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:37,768
the key ecological attributes
of each value.

113
00:06:37,966 --> 00:06:40,828
Then, to select
 the relevant indicators 

114
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:43,880
for each attribute
and to characterize

115
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:47,801
the baseline condition
of the attribute by indicators.

116
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:50,992
Finally, you need to determine
 the acceptable levels 

117
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:54,154
of variation of the indicators
that will obviously contain 

118
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:57,670
the desired state of conservation
 for the considered attribute.

119
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:04,231
Nothing really complicated,
 just a little bit of methodology.
