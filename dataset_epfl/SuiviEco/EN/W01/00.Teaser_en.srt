00:00:06,328 --> 00:00:10,740
Ecological monitoring is a key tool
in protected areas management. 

2
00:00:10,935 --> 00:00:14,410
It provides information both 
on the conservation state

3
00:00:14,593 --> 00:00:18,268
of the values protected by the area,
but also, on the threats

4
00:00:18,477 --> 00:00:20,214
these vales are facing. 

5
00:00:20,737 --> 00:00:25,475
Thanks to monitoring, the impacts 
of our decisions can be assessed, 

6
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:28,689
operations can be re-oriented 
if needed, 

7
00:00:28,886 --> 00:00:31,086
and results can then be measured. 

8
00:00:32,023 --> 00:00:35,811
Monitoring also helps 
to better understand ecosystem,

9
00:00:36,464 --> 00:00:41,252
thereby equipping managers 
for the benefits of conservation. 

10
00:00:41,449 --> 00:00:44,711
It involves many stakeholders 
of the protected area, 

11
00:00:44,943 --> 00:00:47,756
and improves team cohesion. 

12
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:52,721
Thanks to ecological monitoring, 
operations can reported on

13
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:56,289
and decision makers 
gain responsibility. 

14
00:00:56,876 --> 00:01:01,139
Finally, it is an excellent tool
to justify the financial support 

15
00:01:01,348 --> 00:01:05,010
for particular areas, 
and to communicate on successes.

16
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:09,057
This is what this MOOC 
is all about. 

17
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:11,931
It is divided in four units. 

18
00:01:12,144 --> 00:01:14,694
Understanding what 
ecological monitoring is, 

19
00:01:14,887 --> 00:01:18,425
how it is planned, implemented, 
assessed and so on. 

20
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:23,141
Knowing the most treatable
principles and statistical methods.

21
00:01:23,913 --> 00:01:26,688
Discovering what techniques 
to apply 

22
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,750
depending  on the values 
that are being monitored. 

23
00:01:30,979 --> 00:01:34,092
Finally, learning from 
several examples directly

24
00:01:34,263 --> 00:01:38,026
to confirm the field that will 
illustrate everything we see.

25
00:01:38,952 --> 00:01:41,765

additional readings or forum, 

34
00:02:07,024 --> 00:02:10,549
our Facebook page, 
online descriptions to share 

35
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:12,763

36
00:02:13,019 --> 00:02:17,269

00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,840
There you go, now join this 
and together, 

40
00:02:27,047 --> 00:02:29,709
let's make ecological monitoring 
your success factor 

41
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:31,817
for our particular areas.

42
00:02:32,049 --> 00:02:33,724
