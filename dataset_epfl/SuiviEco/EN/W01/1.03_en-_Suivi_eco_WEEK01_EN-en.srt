1
00:00:09,048 --> 00:00:11,486
In a protected area, the idea of
environmental monitoring 

2
00:00:11,686 --> 00:00:12,998
can take on different meanings,

3
00:00:13,223 --> 00:00:16,398
and it is important to
clearly define the terms.

4
00:00:16,970 --> 00:00:19,258
Let's start with inventory.

5
00:00:19,542 --> 00:00:22,179
To make it simple,
the inventory is a census.

6
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,089
It can be qualitative, as in,

7
00:00:25,339 --> 00:00:28,239
what species are present in my
protected area?

8
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,264
It can also be quantitative,

9
00:00:30,464 --> 00:00:33,789
how many individuals of this
species exist?

10
00:00:35,162 --> 00:00:38,712
The inventory needs to be made
by using standardized methods,

11
00:00:38,912 --> 00:00:41,349
and is generally set
in a limited time frame.

12
00:00:41,549 --> 00:00:44,649
It is essentially a data provider,
and is not meant 

13
00:00:44,837 --> 00:00:46,812
to answer a specific question.

14
00:00:47,024 --> 00:00:49,287
It is simply there to give 
information regarding the condition 

15
00:00:49,487 --> 00:00:52,462
of the ecosystem at
a certain point in time.

16
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:56,269
The basic information gathered
from the inventory

17
00:00:56,469 --> 00:00:59,719
is of the presence/absence kind,

18
00:00:59,919 --> 00:01:03,282
like for example the existence 
of a given species

19
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:06,557
at a specific place,
at a specific time.

20
00:01:06,947 --> 00:01:09,322
Now let's talk about
ecological monitoring.

21
00:01:09,592 --> 00:01:13,392
Monitoring in itself is based
on a series of data collections

22
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:15,192
repeated over time.

23
00:01:15,392 --> 00:01:19,955
It consists in systematically gathering
useful pieces of information over time.

24
00:01:20,812 --> 00:01:23,512
Monitoring has a specific goal

25
00:01:23,712 --> 00:01:25,850
and answers the following
kind of question,

26
00:01:26,050 --> 00:01:29,162
what is the condition of the park
through the seasons?

27
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,942
<i>But it can also be introduced
to compare the data we collect</i>

28
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:36,046
<i>with a known standard.</i>

29
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:39,449
<i>It can be a baseline condition
for example like,</i>

30
00:01:39,851 --> 00:01:43,126
<i>the number of animals of a certain
species per unit area,</i>

31
00:01:43,549 --> 00:01:47,637
<i>or in reference to
a desired state,</i>

32
00:01:47,967 --> 00:01:50,692
<i>what would be the number
of animals of this species</i>

33
00:01:50,892 --> 00:01:52,642
<i>if there was no hunting?</i>

34
00:01:53,991 --> 00:01:57,104
Here is another example,
to measure the impact of fire,

35
00:01:57,552 --> 00:02:01,002
isolate a plot where the vegetation
will be preserved

36
00:02:01,202 --> 00:02:04,340
<i>and will serve as a reference
that will allow to understand</i>

37
00:02:04,565 --> 00:02:07,265
<i>the evolution of several
elements like the environment,</i>

38
00:02:07,465 --> 00:02:10,240
the species, depending
on the fire.

39
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:13,202
And this information will help
to take relevant decisions

40
00:02:13,626 --> 00:02:15,163
for the management.

41
00:02:15,646 --> 00:02:19,296
We can then quickly classify
ecological monitoring

42
00:02:19,648 --> 00:02:21,786
in 3 categories.

43
00:02:23,268 --> 00:02:27,555
<i>The monitoring based on, say 
curiosity, referring to a type of</i>

44
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:30,643
essentially leaning to a better
knowledge of the environment,

45
00:02:30,855 --> 00:02:33,330
without necessarily having
a problem to solve.

46
00:02:34,784 --> 00:02:36,734
Mandatory monitoring,

47
00:02:36,934 --> 00:02:41,134
in other words, the regular
follow up of indicators

48
00:02:41,334 --> 00:02:43,659
that are essential for management,

49
00:02:43,859 --> 00:02:47,596
like, for example measuring
the burnt surfaces

50
00:02:47,796 --> 00:02:49,696
<i>in a park every year.</i>

51
00:02:49,896 --> 00:02:52,759
And then action oriented monitoring

52
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,096
whose aim is to solve
a precise problem

53
00:02:55,467 --> 00:02:59,029
and is therefore developed specifically
in relation to this problem,

54
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,446
which is by the way not necessarily
linked to a matter of daily management

55
00:03:03,646 --> 00:03:04,971
in the protected area.

56
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:09,408
Okay, let's move on to
a different word

57
00:03:09,608 --> 00:03:12,321
and approach the surveillance.

58
00:03:13,068 --> 00:03:16,356
So surveillance in this context
covers two dimensions.

59
00:03:16,581 --> 00:03:18,956
The park surveillance can be
an inventory program

60
00:03:19,156 --> 00:03:22,743
systematically repeated in order
to provide time series of measures.

61
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:27,564
Surveillance consists in repeating
the collection of data over time,

62
00:03:27,764 --> 00:03:31,914
with no preconceived idea of
the evolution of those parameters

63
00:03:32,114 --> 00:03:33,514
that are being measured.

64
00:03:34,383 --> 00:03:36,908
Therefore, surveillance 
is essentially  descriptive.

65
00:03:38,902 --> 00:03:41,714
You can, for example
focus on 

66
00:03:41,914 --> 00:03:44,702
gathering meteorological data
in a park,

67
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:48,656
and file them, keep them 
in the event

68
00:03:48,856 --> 00:03:52,093
of having to use them later
on for research.

69
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,822
Surveillance also refers to
the control of activities

70
00:03:57,034 --> 00:03:59,959
taking place in the park,
like the fight against poaching.

71
00:04:00,956 --> 00:04:03,143
<i>If this this type of surveillance
is not directly linked</i>

72
00:04:03,356 --> 00:04:04,606
<i>to an environmental monitoring,</i>

73
00:04:04,806 --> 00:04:08,531
<i>very often, the rangers also
carry out ecological surveys</i>

74
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:10,256
<i>during their patrols.</i>

75
00:04:12,472 --> 00:04:14,460
There is a small frontier

76
00:04:14,674 --> 00:04:17,137
between monitoring and surveillance,

77
00:04:17,552 --> 00:04:21,064
but the difference is real,
monitoring has a specific goal,

78
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:23,964
it answers a management problem.

79
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:28,314
Surveillance may only be a process
of collecting information

80
00:04:28,836 --> 00:04:32,811
that may or may not 
be used subsequently.

81
00:04:33,903 --> 00:04:35,940
<i>For example, the surveillance
of a river</i>

82
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:40,353
<i>can help to detect a variation in
quantities of fish present over time.</i>

83
00:04:40,553 --> 00:04:43,065
But if you are not looking
at a particular species,

84
00:04:43,265 --> 00:04:46,590
you won't be able to link these
variations to the diet

85
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:49,715
of the white cheeked otter living 
in the same river for instance.

86
00:04:50,746 --> 00:04:54,058
Last but not least, let's
look at research.

87
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:58,155
<i>A research program is based
on a starting assumption</i>

88
00:04:58,355 --> 00:05:01,855
<i>and aims at validating it
after having processed data</i>

89
00:05:02,055 --> 00:05:03,693
<i>and analysed the results.</i>

90
00:05:03,993 --> 00:05:05,568
Part of it can be experimental

91
00:05:05,768 --> 00:05:08,768
and take a step back from
data collected in the field.

92
00:05:09,472 --> 00:05:12,972
Research is the main component
of the management scheme

93
00:05:13,493 --> 00:05:17,631
<i>but goes beyond the sole needs in
management of the protected area.</i>

94
00:05:18,299 --> 00:05:20,737
<i>It encompasses 
not only monitoring,</i>

95
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:24,174
<i>but also allows 
a better understanding</i>

96
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,587
<i>of the way the site is run.</i>

97
00:05:27,581 --> 00:05:30,418
For instance, the drop 
in fertility of the swallows

98
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:32,831
can be observed in the course
of a multi-year

99
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:34,793
environmental monitoring program,

100
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:38,824
but it is by specifically studying 
the diet of these birds

101
00:05:39,024 --> 00:05:42,099
that we are able to see that 
the problem can be pin pointed

102
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:45,987
to the use of certain pesticides,
and that is provided by research.

103
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:50,754
In brief, the ecological monitoring
of a protected area

104
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:54,554
consists in following the values
of the territory

105
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:57,479
in a methodical way, over time

106
00:05:57,679 --> 00:06:00,029
and with a specific goal.

107
00:06:00,942 --> 00:06:03,855
It gives information about
the condition of the protected area

108
00:06:04,055 --> 00:06:06,430
in the course of time,
and is hence

109
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:09,467
in a position to guide
the site management.
