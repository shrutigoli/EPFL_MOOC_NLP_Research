1
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:12,980
We have already seen
what attributes offer a given value

2
00:00:13,164 --> 00:00:15,652
to manage of, 
and how to do so.

3
00:00:15,795 --> 00:00:19,870
But, all the aspects still need
to be clarified.

4
00:00:20,542 --> 00:00:23,642
Yes, for example, do we need 
to assess the entire population

5
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:27,301
of the monitored species, 
or rather it's entire habitat,

6
00:00:27,571 --> 00:00:30,358
or will assessing only 
a part of it be enough?

7
00:00:30,602 --> 00:00:36,290
How many assessments need to be made
to get a result accurate enough

8
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:39,179
for good management
decision making?

9
00:00:39,405 --> 00:00:42,155
When, how often and where
do these assessments 

10
00:00:42,369 --> 00:00:45,718
of the chosen ecological attribute
needs to be made?

11
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:48,826
Well, this is precisely
 the sampling plan

12
00:00:48,990 --> 00:00:52,628
that will allow us to answer
these practical questions.

13
00:00:53,535 --> 00:00:56,923
Sampling is particularly useful,
when a monitored value covers 

14
00:00:57,122 --> 00:00:58,246
a large area. 

15
00:00:58,375 --> 00:01:01,513
Indeed monitoring everything
will not only be expensive

16
00:01:01,705 --> 00:01:04,567
but also unsuitable because 
it gives way to bias 

17
00:01:04,792 --> 00:01:07,017
that will skew the final results.

18
00:01:07,197 --> 00:01:09,634
Particularly if the monitor species
is mobile

19
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:12,055
or if the targeted eco-systems 
spread over

20
00:01:12,194 --> 00:01:14,419
 too many inaccessible areas.

21
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:18,741
The total count of the vast
 protected area 

22
00:01:18,945 --> 00:01:24,170
of a very mobile species 
creates a high risk 

23
00:01:24,368 --> 00:01:28,481
of unknowingly counting
the same animal several times

24
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,665
leading to false results.

25
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:35,754
There are cases, however, 
in which sampling is not required.

26
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:40,900
For instance, when a considered
values spread over a small surface

27
00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:45,807
which can be entirely covered
proceeding to counting the values,

28
00:01:45,976 --> 00:01:49,513
entire population
would be in that case very easy.

29
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:51,967
So same to sampling,

30
00:01:52,177 --> 00:01:54,589
you only need to asses a portion
of the value. 

31
00:01:54,806 --> 00:01:57,793
And then to extrapolate the result
to the entire population.

32
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:00,505
Like, to the surface area 
of the forest for instance

33
00:02:00,749 --> 00:02:03,375
or to the entire population
of the animal specie

34
00:02:03,533 --> 00:02:06,869
and this portion of the value
that is being assessed 

35
00:02:07,056 --> 00:02:08,831
is what is call the sample.

36
00:02:09,048 --> 00:02:10,110
That is it.

37
00:02:10,283 --> 00:02:15,696
Now, what steps need to be 
followed to draw a sampling plan?

38
00:02:15,897 --> 00:02:17,672
First, you need to decide

39
00:02:17,851 --> 00:02:21,776
where in the particular area
you need to collect this information

40
00:02:21,997 --> 00:02:24,823
In other words, what will
be the sample size?

41
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,767
Be careful, in order to get
an adequate picture,

42
00:02:28,937 --> 00:02:31,737
it is essential 
for the sampling size

43
00:02:31,951 --> 00:02:34,551
to reflect the entire value.

44
00:02:34,709 --> 00:02:37,709
This is what we call 
the representativeness 

45
00:02:37,915 --> 00:02:42,028
of the sample against the species'
global population

46
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,003
 within a particular area.

47
00:02:44,657 --> 00:02:48,944
To guarantee this, its better
to proceed to random sampling.

48
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:53,678
This way you are making sure 
each sample unit of the population

49
00:02:53,858 --> 00:02:56,520
has an equal chance 
of being selected.

50
00:02:57,178 --> 00:03:01,602
And since we are looking
to asses specific parameters

51
00:03:01,885 --> 00:03:05,272
of a species in a given habitat, 
it may be relevant 

52
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:11,051
to proceed to a random, stratified,
or clustered sampling. 

53
00:03:11,818 --> 00:03:14,731
There are indeed quite offensive
substantial variations 

54
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:18,177
within the protected area
for the ecological attribute 

55
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:20,779
that is being assessed, 
and this can be caused 

56
00:03:20,969 --> 00:03:24,319
by environmental guidance 
or by difference in management 

57
00:03:24,506 --> 00:03:27,256
between different areas 
of the protected area. 

58
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:32,079
In this type of situation, 
it can be useful to divide a site 

59
00:03:32,309 --> 00:03:35,796
into sub-units let's say, or strata,

60
00:03:36,044 --> 00:03:38,657
that refer to different 
characteristics 

61
00:03:38,908 --> 00:03:42,108
of the considered 
ecological attributes. 

62
00:03:42,318 --> 00:03:45,206
Like the different densities 
of a single species 

63
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:47,810
according to it's location
for instance. 

64
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:53,084
This way, you can sample 
each stratum separately. 

65
00:03:53,279 --> 00:03:55,954
Estimation-based strata 
are then combined

66
00:03:56,201 --> 00:03:59,276
to give an estimation 
of the whole protected area 

67
00:03:59,495 --> 00:04:00,695
for this attributes. 

68
00:04:00,901 --> 00:04:03,376
Stratified sampling is therefore, 
generally used 

69
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:06,172
to make estimations more accurate.

70
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:09,453
The second step of designing 
the sampling plan 

71
00:04:09,665 --> 00:04:15,140
consists in choosing the size and 
the  number of samples to collect.

72
00:04:15,352 --> 00:04:17,827
The step is very important. 

73
00:04:18,078 --> 00:04:20,915
It essentially depends 
on the degree of precision

74
00:04:21,122 --> 00:04:24,409
and at which we want to assess
the considered attribute. 

75
00:04:24,653 --> 00:04:26,753
Because the more precision  
you want, 

76
00:04:26,957 --> 00:04:29,707
the more samples you will 
need to collect, but obviously, 

77
00:04:29,944 --> 00:04:33,194
the more there is to sample, 
the more expensive it will be. 

78
00:04:33,391 --> 00:04:36,504
The third step consist in deciding

79
00:04:36,724 --> 00:04:38,811
on the sample collection 
calendar

80
00:04:38,998 --> 00:04:41,111
in the identified sampling area,

81
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:47,198
At what time of the year, 
and of day, will they take place?

82
00:04:47,950 --> 00:04:50,087
And also, how often?

83
00:04:50,894 --> 00:04:53,957
These choices, essentially depend
on the biological cycles 

84
00:04:54,185 --> 00:04:55,835
of the monitored values. 

85
00:04:56,038 --> 00:04:58,650
For instance, it's best to choose 
the time of year or day 

86
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:01,441
when animals are more active 
to be sure the observers

87
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:03,069
will be able to spot them. 

88
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:08,681
Yes, monitoring populations 
of winter migratory bird population

89
00:05:08,926 --> 00:05:11,626
should be done in the middle
of the winter 

90
00:05:11,832 --> 00:05:15,419
when the expected population 
of birds have arrived 

91
00:05:15,662 --> 00:05:17,912
and are not ready to leave yet. 

92
00:05:18,159 --> 00:05:20,671
Like these bee eaters for instance. 

93
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:24,011
Plants are better monitored 
after flouring period. 

94
00:05:24,197 --> 00:05:27,197
Otherwise, you risk counting 
only the foreign plants 

95
00:05:27,406 --> 00:05:30,706
and forget to detect the stems 
that don't floral discharge. 

96
00:05:31,993 --> 00:05:34,943
Deciding on the frequency 
of assessments, 

97
00:05:35,134 --> 00:05:39,584
depends essentially on the speed 
at which changes occur 

98
00:05:39,821 --> 00:05:42,484
within the considered attribute. 

99
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,433
For instance, endangered 
animal species can decline rapidly 

100
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:48,319
due to bad management. 

101
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:52,290
and you will then need to increase
the frequency of assessment

102
00:05:52,503 --> 00:05:54,328
of relevant indicators. 

103
00:05:54,605 --> 00:05:56,892
Like we see with this 
black rhino for instance.

104
00:05:57,102 --> 00:06:01,427
Hopefully, this will allow
to react on time 

105
00:06:01,673 --> 00:06:05,048
if it's not too late.
