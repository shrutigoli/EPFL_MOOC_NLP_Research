1
00:00:08,544 --> 00:00:11,145
We've seen which indicators
to assess over time

2
00:00:11,341 --> 00:00:14,066
to determine the
health of the values

3
00:00:14,262 --> 00:00:17,875
by following the key
ecological attributes.

4
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,998
In practice how can these
assessments be made in the field?

5
00:00:23,324 --> 00:00:26,675
Actually choosing an assessment
approach will depend

6
00:00:26,888 --> 00:00:28,951
on the ecological
attribute to assess

7
00:00:29,154 --> 00:00:32,542
and therefore on its
ecological characteristics.

8
00:00:33,313 --> 00:00:36,375
For instance, a species
that is abundant enough

9
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:39,424
to be detected from
afar in the savannah

10
00:00:39,652 --> 00:00:42,178
could be subject to
an aerial count.

11
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:46,575
One this approach wouldn't
work for: a nocturnal species

12
00:00:46,762 --> 00:00:50,413
or one living
in a dense forest.

13
00:00:50,844 --> 00:00:54,394
You also need to make sure
that the chosen approach is

14
00:00:54,604 --> 00:00:57,929
precise enough to carefully
detect all the variation

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,093
of the ecological attributes
so the approach needs to have

16
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,759
broader detection limits
than the range

17
00:01:04,951 --> 00:01:08,576
of variation
of the attributes itself.

18
00:01:09,114 --> 00:01:13,127
For instance, if you want to
assess the evolution of plants

19
00:01:13,643 --> 00:01:15,930
on a small area,
remote sensing from

20
00:01:16,127 --> 00:01:19,540
a satellite image
wont be the best solution

21
00:01:19,738 --> 00:01:22,888
because of it's
low resolution.

22
00:01:23,235 --> 00:01:25,372
The approaches to measure
the variation of

23
00:01:25,578 --> 00:01:28,791
ecological attributes can be
direct, meaning the focus

24
00:01:28,971 --> 00:01:31,759
on the attribute itself
like the number of individuals

25
00:01:31,929 --> 00:01:33,641
of a species
for example

26
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,277
or they can also be indirect
and in this case

27
00:01:38,447 --> 00:01:41,060
focus on the variable connected
to the attribute

28
00:01:41,279 --> 00:01:43,942
like the number of tracks
on the ground or the nest

29
00:01:44,154 --> 00:01:47,253
or the damages on the tree
or the droppings, et cetera.

30
00:01:48,446 --> 00:01:51,546
Imagine you want to measure the
concentration of chimpanzees

31
00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:54,785
in a park. Are they living
in dense forest

32
00:01:54,991 --> 00:01:57,567
where it is difficult to see
them through the leaves?

33
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,655
It is better to count their nests
which are much easier to detect.

34
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:07,067
So the nests are in this case
an indirect indicator

35
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:10,484
of the presence and the
number of chimpanzees.

36
00:02:11,102 --> 00:02:13,752
We see here that the choice of
a suitable approach

37
00:02:13,956 --> 00:02:17,344
requires good knowledge of the
ecological attributes in question.

38
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:22,571
It is thus not relevant
to choose an approach only

39
00:02:22,924 --> 00:02:27,111
because the managers are used
to using it if it does not

40
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:31,657
allow to properly measure
the variations of the attribute.

41
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:35,944
The monitoring results would be
unusual and the time span

42
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:39,497
to set it up will be
most certainly wasted.

43
00:02:40,339 --> 00:02:44,327
Whatever the approach, the
collected data can be qualitative

44
00:02:44,559 --> 00:02:47,784
meaning they are of 
presence/absence kind

45
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:50,991
or classified in categories
like rare, occasional,

46
00:02:51,204 --> 00:02:53,979
frequent, abundant,
et cetera.

47
00:02:54,773 --> 00:02:58,023
They can also be quantitative.
For example, the number

48
00:02:58,231 --> 00:03:02,093
of individuals or tracks
in a specific area.

49
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:06,885
Quantitative data are precise
but generally require

50
00:03:07,092 --> 00:03:09,554
creative thought
to collect.

51
00:03:09,805 --> 00:03:12,980
And that's not all.
The method used for counting

52
00:03:13,201 --> 00:03:16,401
should be the most reliable
in measuring what we want

53
00:03:16,625 --> 00:03:19,775
in view of the context of
the protected area itself.

54
00:03:20,059 --> 00:03:23,809
So it's important to choose the
method involving the least bias.

55
00:03:24,355 --> 00:03:28,630
For example, if you are looking
to estimate the density of

56
00:03:28,823 --> 00:03:33,585
antelope in a park, you could
count from the ground by foot,

57
00:03:33,816 --> 00:03:39,391
by car or by overflying
the zone in low altitude.

58
00:03:39,611 --> 00:03:42,061
If you are in a park where
poaching is a problem,

59
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,400
an animal runs away
as you get closer

60
00:03:45,687 --> 00:03:48,524
counting directly from the ground
may be difficult since

61
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:52,772
the animals will run away
before you have time to see them.

62
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:57,719
Aerial counting would be, in this
case, the most suitable

63
00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:03,126
because it allows for the detection
of animals at a greater distance.

64
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:08,455
Bias can occur at different levels.
It can be linked to the observer

65
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:11,592
who makes mistakes when
identifying a species

66
00:04:11,784 --> 00:04:14,197
or estimating the size
of a group of the species

67
00:04:14,446 --> 00:04:17,821
for instance and it can also be
linked to the monitoring conditions

68
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:21,887
like bad weather that can affect
the quality of observation

69
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,171
during the collection of
data in the field.

70
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:30,520
Bias can also be connected to
the type of habitat.

71
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:35,601
In zones with dense vegetation
identifying certain species

72
00:04:35,821 --> 00:04:39,384
will be more difficult.
We saw that for the chimps.

73
00:04:39,663 --> 00:04:42,851
It can be connected to the
time of the day or year

74
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:47,938
because some species are active
or not and therefore visible

75
00:04:48,158 --> 00:04:52,495
or not only at certain times.
This needs to be taken

76
00:04:52,727 --> 00:04:55,090
into account
in the protocol.

77
00:04:56,123 --> 00:05:00,598
Finally, you also need to understand
that some biases are inevitable

78
00:05:00,829 --> 00:05:03,767
and it's important to estimate
whether or not they are likely

79
00:05:03,965 --> 00:05:06,615
to have fact effects 
the validity of the final results

80
00:05:06,845 --> 00:05:10,520
of ecological monitoring.
So beforehand you need to

81
00:05:10,737 --> 00:05:14,425
identify all the possible sources
of bias in order to attempt

82
00:05:14,632 --> 00:05:17,632
to control or reduce them
if possible.
