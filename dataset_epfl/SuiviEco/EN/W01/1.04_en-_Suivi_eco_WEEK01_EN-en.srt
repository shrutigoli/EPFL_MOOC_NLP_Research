1
00:00:09,372 --> 00:00:13,571
Ecological monitoring has several
key functions in a protected area.

2
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:15,260
As we have already seen,

3
00:00:15,676 --> 00:00:18,426
it is not just a photo 
at a given moment,

4
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:22,501
but it is conducted
for a specific purpose.

5
00:00:23,982 --> 00:00:25,894
Thanks to ecological monitoring,

6
00:00:26,094 --> 00:00:30,844
you get to know the species of fauna
and flora populating the protected area.

7
00:00:31,301 --> 00:00:34,051
Their abundance, their significance,

8
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:36,476
and the relationships between them.

9
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:41,239
You also get to measure the temporal
and geographical distribution

10
00:00:41,678 --> 00:00:45,041
and observe potential changes
in all these parameters

11
00:00:45,241 --> 00:00:47,878
in the short, medium, and long haul,

12
00:00:48,078 --> 00:00:52,328
as well as the biotic and abiotic
factors influencing the species

13
00:00:52,528 --> 00:00:57,716
such as the soil condition, the fires,
climate variations and so on.

14
00:00:58,653 --> 00:01:01,703
Knowing the original state
of the environment

15
00:01:01,903 --> 00:01:04,752
in itself is a fundamental step
to being able 

16
00:01:04,952 --> 00:01:08,678
to determine the changes induced
by management,

17
00:01:08,878 --> 00:01:12,391
or by events that escape
from manager's control.

18
00:01:13,164 --> 00:01:16,876
But this baseline condition 
is of little relevance

19
00:01:17,076 --> 00:01:20,289
if you don't link it to
the optimal condition

20
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:23,489
in which the protected area 
should be.

21
00:01:25,006 --> 00:01:28,656
Too many conservation projects
still set as baseline condition

22
00:01:28,856 --> 00:01:32,344
the state in which they found the
protected area at the beginning.

23
00:01:32,672 --> 00:01:36,197
Because of this, the goals set
to improve the protected area

24
00:01:36,397 --> 00:01:39,184
can lead to a state that is
actually quite average

25
00:01:39,384 --> 00:01:42,384
compared to that in which 
the site should be

26
00:01:42,584 --> 00:01:45,584
if work would have been done 
correctly and continuously.

27
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,132
It would in fact be wiser

28
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:53,332
to estimate the protected area's
ideal condition,

29
00:01:53,532 --> 00:01:56,532
<i>and then to set a rate
of the progress</i>

30
00:01:56,732 --> 00:01:59,732
<i>that is intended to be made
to achieve this goal.</i>

31
00:02:00,156 --> 00:02:04,056
<i>This would make the project's
impact more understandable</i>

32
00:02:04,256 --> 00:02:09,630
and make analysis of the cost 
benefit ratio more consistent.

33
00:02:11,738 --> 00:02:14,425
On the basis of this
acute knowledge of the site,

34
00:02:14,625 --> 00:02:17,438
monitoring allows you to determine
the heritage values 

35
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:21,924
of the protected area, those that are
targeted by management actions.

36
00:02:23,213 --> 00:02:25,300
<i>It also helps to identify</i>

37
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:28,988
<i>the pressures, and the threats,
the values are facing,</i>

38
00:02:29,384 --> 00:02:33,447
their scope, importance,
and evolution.

39
00:02:34,183 --> 00:02:36,933
<i>Monitoring gives information
regarding the interactions</i>

40
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:39,446
<i>between all the identified factors,</i>

41
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:43,648
<i>be they biotic or abiotic, 
in space and in time.</i>

42
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:47,211
<i>But also on the evolution
of these indicators</i>

43
00:02:47,411 --> 00:02:49,998
<i>that will allow measuring
the protection</i>

44
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:52,136
<i>of the threatened values.</i>

45
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:55,331
Climate change is a good
example of alteration

46
00:02:55,531 --> 00:02:59,656
suffered by an environment that can 
only be detected in the long haul,

47
00:02:59,843 --> 00:03:02,656
through strict monitoring that
requires special targeting

48
00:03:02,881 --> 00:03:05,756
to detect the threat
and assess it.

49
00:03:06,156 --> 00:03:08,894
Yes, absolutely, this work
on values

50
00:03:09,094 --> 00:03:11,756
will enable prioritizing actions,

51
00:03:11,956 --> 00:03:14,006
both according to what
we expect,

52
00:03:14,381 --> 00:03:18,355
key values to preserve, and to
what is indeed feasible,

53
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,993
depending on the means
we have.

54
00:03:23,674 --> 00:03:27,386
<i>The understanding of the way
the protected area works</i>

55
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:29,936
<i>is key to avoid seeking</i>

56
00:03:30,136 --> 00:03:33,199
<i>to follow indicators
that are too complicated</i>

57
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:38,586
<i>when more accessible and
cheaper ones exist.</i>

58
00:03:40,212 --> 00:03:44,012
For instance, monitoring populations
of hoofed mammals in the forest

59
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,900
is usually simply done
by measuring the damages

60
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:49,712
caused to trees in
benchmarked areas.

61
00:03:50,117 --> 00:03:53,354
If the amount of damage increases,

62
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:56,617
more animals are collected, 
and conversely,

63
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:59,942
if the damages decrease too much,
we limit the number of animals

64
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:03,254
being collected in order to let
the populations recover.

65
00:04:04,545 --> 00:04:07,295
The management plan includes
a part where

66
00:04:07,495 --> 00:04:10,495
the ecological monitoring
is described.

67
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:15,167
It is crucial to think through
this part according to the staff's

68
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:18,867
practical needs, theoretical
and in skills,

69
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:22,067
as well as the actual means
at hand.

70
00:04:23,481 --> 00:04:27,556
Let's not forget that the analysis 
of results provided by monitoring

71
00:04:27,756 --> 00:04:30,294
will allow to determine
new management actions

72
00:04:30,494 --> 00:04:33,356
and thereby new
monitoring procedures.

73
00:04:33,928 --> 00:04:38,966
Thus, ecological monitoring truly
is a major component

74
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,266
of adaptive management.

75
00:04:42,538 --> 00:04:45,713
As such, management decisions
will evolve over time

76
00:04:45,913 --> 00:04:49,476
thanks to ecological monitoring
and vice versa.

77
00:04:49,972 --> 00:04:52,322
This monitoring will
specifically determine

78
00:04:52,535 --> 00:04:56,985
if the species of special interest, that 
are the values of the protected area

79
00:04:57,228 --> 00:04:59,591
remain within acceptable limits,

80
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,666
so the standards 
for their conservation.

81
00:05:03,974 --> 00:05:06,524
It will help understand
if the pressures

82
00:05:06,724 --> 00:05:09,399
and the threats are being controlled

83
00:05:09,599 --> 00:05:14,174
and redirect management according
to the changes that were detected.

84
00:05:15,577 --> 00:05:18,602
It enables to prioritize the means
allocated to the conservation

85
00:05:18,802 --> 00:05:21,964
according to the effectiveness
and to the pressures

86
00:05:22,164 --> 00:05:25,214
that arise but also to 
communicate the successes

87
00:05:25,414 --> 00:05:28,002
that have been achieved and
to learn from past mistakes.

88
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,945
As we already mentioned earlier,

89
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:35,795
the management plan defines 
its goals at different levels,

90
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:39,866
and the collected information
during the ecological monitoring

91
00:05:40,356 --> 00:05:44,669
will allow to measure the degree
to which the program's objectives

92
00:05:45,098 --> 00:05:46,673
are met.

93
00:05:47,928 --> 00:05:51,653
Monitoring will then directly 
measure the manger's ability

94
00:05:51,853 --> 00:05:55,378
to execute the plan and achieve
the projected results,

95
00:05:55,578 --> 00:05:59,465
and to give an unbiased assessment
of his work quality.

96
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:03,658
Ecological monitoring also
shows the necessity

97
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:07,895
to have managers and scientists
working together

98
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,645
if you want to achieve the best
adaptive management possible.

99
00:06:12,928 --> 00:06:16,690
For instance, a recent study carried
out on 200 protected areas

100
00:06:16,890 --> 00:06:20,653
<i>in 34 countries showed 
the positive correlation</i>

101
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:23,740
<i>between the good results obtained
regarding conservation</i>

102
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:26,940
<i>and the existence of adapted
ecological monitoring.</i>

103
00:06:27,251 --> 00:06:29,526
The protected areas
where monitoring

104
00:06:29,726 --> 00:06:32,138
is not or just partially implemented

105
00:06:32,338 --> 00:06:34,526
show the lowest success rate.

106
00:06:36,405 --> 00:06:40,280
However, ecological monitoring
is sometimes perceived

107
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,880
as too expensive and offers

108
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:45,943
too little economic return.

109
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:50,065
Of course, monitoring an ecosystem
is a long term investment

110
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:52,953
because change occurs slowly.

111
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:56,237
But too many decisions
are made

112
00:06:56,775 --> 00:07:00,400
'out of habit' or by people
thinking in the short term

113
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,975
without even trying
to identify

114
00:07:03,175 --> 00:07:07,387
if better actions could be carried 
out for the protected area.

115
00:07:09,588 --> 00:07:13,675
A good example is the early detection
of the emergence of invading species

116
00:07:13,888 --> 00:07:16,563
that requires strict
ecological monitoring.

117
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:21,053
<i>The potential risk needs
to have been identified,</i>

118
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:23,419
and thereby it is
important to know

119
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:25,682
the potentially
dangerous species,

120
00:07:25,882 --> 00:07:28,882
to have well-trained staff

121
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:33,107
to setup a permanent monitoring
protocol, etc.

122
00:07:34,628 --> 00:07:35,653
Generally speaking,

123
00:07:35,853 --> 00:07:38,278
since we are talking
about a potential risk

124
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:39,640
and not a reality,

125
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:43,915
all these things aren't done because
they are viewed of little importance

126
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:45,578
by managers actually.

127
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:49,904
<i>When a species, here 
we can see (INAUDIBLE),</i>

128
00:07:50,104 --> 00:07:51,954
<i>is eventually detected,</i>

129
00:07:52,154 --> 00:07:55,817
<i>it is generally too late for a small
intervention to suffice,</i>

130
00:07:56,017 --> 00:07:58,842
and costs related to the
rehabilitation of 

131
00:07:59,042 --> 00:08:01,867
the environment exceeds by far

132
00:08:02,067 --> 00:08:05,954
that of ecological monitoring
that should have taken place.

133
00:08:07,738 --> 00:08:09,063
So think twice

134
00:08:09,263 --> 00:08:12,351
before putting off a much needed
ecological monitoring program

135
00:08:12,551 --> 00:08:13,938
because of your budget.
