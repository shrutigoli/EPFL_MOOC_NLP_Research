00:00:09,159 --> 00:00:11,634
Hello and welcome
to the first unit

2
00:00:11,848 --> 00:00:14,848
of our MOOC on
ecological monitoring.

3
00:00:16,101 --> 00:00:19,163
This unit introduces the concept
of ecological monitoring.

4
00:00:19,379 --> 00:00:24,404
It will help us better understand
how this monitoring is operated.

5
00:00:24,789 --> 00:00:28,951
No panic. We will go into further
details in the next unit.

6
00:00:30,594 --> 00:00:34,231
Let's follow the line
to identify the questions

7
00:00:34,428 --> 00:00:36,965
we need to
ask ourselves.

8
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:40,165
Why proceed to
ecological monitoring?

9
00:00:40,372 --> 00:00:42,860
We will see why
it is important.

10
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:46,151
What it's connection
with planning is.

11
00:00:46,427 --> 00:00:47,940
We will see
how it contributes

12
00:00:48,122 --> 00:00:51,334
to the effectiveness
of our actions and so on.

13
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,695
What is ecological monitoring
and definitely what is it not?

14
00:00:57,905 --> 00:01:02,418
How to differentiate it from
inventories or research for instance.

15
00:01:03,109 --> 00:01:07,046
What is it for? How does it feed
the decision making process

16
00:01:07,268 --> 00:01:09,618
or does it give
accounts on the state of

17
00:01:09,817 --> 00:01:12,117
the protected area values;
on the pressures,

18
00:01:12,322 --> 00:01:15,734
on the threats,
on the impact of our work?

19
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,528
How to define it's objectives.
More specifically we need to look at

20
00:01:21,721 --> 00:01:24,783
what values to monitor.
What ecological attributes

21
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:29,572
characterize them; what indicators
are more important et cetera.

22
00:01:30,017 --> 00:01:33,117
How to choose the monitoring method
depending on the 

23
00:01:33,334 --> 00:01:35,522
ecological attributes
we target, of course

24
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,020
but also the
context in which we work.

25
00:01:39,427 --> 00:01:43,402
What is sampling and how
to organize our work

26
00:01:43,605 --> 00:01:46,942
for a better
effort : result ratio.

27
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:51,141
At what cost because
this will determine our choices

28
00:01:51,347 --> 00:01:54,722
in method, equipment,
staffing and so on.

29
00:01:55,474 --> 00:01:58,711
What type of
analysis should be chosen?

30
00:01:59,027 --> 00:02:01,252
This will prepare us for
the second unit

31
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,512
where will go into
more detail regarding

32
00:02:03,728 --> 00:02:06,816
the statistics applied
to ecological monitoring.

33
00:02:07,547 --> 00:02:10,847
Finally the unit will
end with a short summary

34
00:02:11,049 --> 00:02:14,324
of everything
we've seen thus far.

35
00:02:15,066 --> 00:02:18,904
There. Don't forget about the
quizzes between the sequences.

36
00:02:19,126 --> 00:02:21,789
They can help you
make better progress.

37
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:24,777
Have an
excellent first unit.
