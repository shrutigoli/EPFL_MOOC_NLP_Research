Hello and welcome to this
MOOC on ecological monitoring.

2
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:18,336
This MOOC is about a fundamental
tool for protected areas management.

3
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:22,767
It will help us understand
what ecological monitoring is,

4
00:00:22,992 --> 00:00:25,766
what it's benefits
and limitations are

5
00:00:26,032 --> 00:00:28,644
and how to implement it.
How to use the results

6
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:33,250
to improve our impacts on
conservation and so on.

7
00:00:35,014 --> 00:00:37,877
In the first unit we will
introduce the concept of

8
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,705
ecological monitoring.
This will help us better understand

9
00:00:41,892 --> 00:00:45,867
the conditions of such monitoring;
why you would do it?

10
00:00:46,092 --> 00:00:51,717
What is it for? How are the values,
attributes and indicators defined?

11
00:00:52,086 --> 00:00:54,787
What methods should be used?
At what cost?

12
00:00:55,009 --> 00:00:58,110
What kind of sample should we
target and so and so.

13
00:00:59,438 --> 00:01:03,338
The second unit will look into the
useful statistical methods

14
00:01:03,536 --> 00:01:05,549
to carry out
ecological monitoring.

15
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,929
We will talk about the
general statistical concepts

16
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:12,691
and also about uses
applied to monitoring.

17
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:15,699
The third unit will
introduce different

18
00:01:15,892 --> 00:01:18,506
monitoring techniques
used on the field.

19
00:01:18,724 --> 00:01:21,912
How to monitor the
ecosystems or the vegetation,

20
00:01:22,106 --> 00:01:25,781
mammals, birds,
directly or indirectly.

21
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:28,376
We will also present
some specific methods

22
00:01:28,574 --> 00:01:30,924
that can be applied to
carnivores, primates,

23
00:01:31,143 --> 00:01:33,893
migratory species,
et cetera.

24
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:37,998
Finally in the fourth unit
we will give practical examples

25
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:42,044
to illustrate the concept;
ecological monitoring applied to

26
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:45,726
peer networks, marine,
terrestrial sites, forest,

27
00:01:46,245 --> 00:01:49,245
savanna, wetlands,
targeted species.

28
00:01:49,456 --> 00:01:54,719
In other words a representative
sample of real-life possibilities.

29
00:01:56,102 --> 00:02:00,202
There, now it's your turn.
Don't forget about the quizzes

30
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:03,620
and of course
the exams after each unit.

31
00:02:03,854 --> 00:02:06,554
They will certainly help you
making good progress.

32
00:02:06,823 --> 00:02:08,761
Have a
great MOOC.
