1
00:00:09,364 --> 00:00:11,727
Protected areas preserve values.

2
00:00:11,927 --> 00:00:16,024
These values can be animal
and plant species

3
00:00:16,224 --> 00:00:18,445
as well as ecosystems.

4
00:00:18,645 --> 00:00:23,713
These are the values that need to be maintained
in a sustainable way.

5
00:00:23,913 --> 00:00:28,023
It is, therefore, important to be able
to measure the current state

6
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:30,224
and the evolution of these values,

7
00:00:30,424 --> 00:00:34,122
as well as to detect the threats
they are facing.

8
00:00:34,322 --> 00:00:36,282
In Burundi, for instance,

9
00:00:36,482 --> 00:00:38,843
an invasive plant species, the Lantana

10
00:00:39,043 --> 00:00:41,670
has taken over the Rusizi National Park, completely.

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,361
To avoid this situation,

12
00:00:43,561 --> 00:00:47,595
the problem should have been identified
upon finding the plant in the park,

13
00:00:47,795 --> 00:00:49,218
but it is now probably too late.

14
00:00:49,418 --> 00:00:53,176
The park has lost an important part
of it's ecological value now.

15
00:00:53,376 --> 00:00:58,210
Ecological monitoring is a key step
in adaptive management,

16
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:03,367
but it is not the only tool that can get
information from the field.

17
00:01:03,567 --> 00:01:04,613
Indeed.

18
00:01:04,813 --> 00:01:07,749
Other means such as anti-poaching surveillance,
research, and tourism

19
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:10,173
can also provide a lot of information,
actually.

20
00:01:10,373 --> 00:01:15,262
Okay. This is agreed, but ecological monitoring
remains the main source

21
00:01:15,462 --> 00:01:20,169
to guide decisions, and actions,
for site management.

22
00:01:20,369 --> 00:01:21,487
Yeah, sure.

23
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:23,722
In the early 2000s, 

24
00:01:23,922 --> 00:01:29,317
when the population of Black Rhinoceros
in the North Cameroon disappeared,

25
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:33,829
strict ecological monitoring,
like collecting droppings for instance,

26
00:01:34,029 --> 00:01:37,758
would have allowed us to identify
the imminent threat of these extinction,

27
00:01:37,958 --> 00:01:42,776
or at least to stop the useless surveillance
once the species disappeared.

28
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:48,630
We know that a protected area
is a special kind of territory

29
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:50,330
with several characteristics:

30
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:55,709
it is defined, recognized, dedicated, and so on,

31
00:01:55,909 --> 00:01:59,777
and it is managed for the conservation
of nature.

32
00:02:00,833 --> 00:02:04,287
Keep in mind, as this is its primary goal,

33
00:02:04,487 --> 00:02:06,866
as we explained in the MOOC
on Protected Area Management

34
00:02:07,066 --> 00:02:09,636
in the 4th sequence of the 1st module.

35
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:14,274
Ecological monitoring can be applied to many
territories and species

36
00:02:14,474 --> 00:02:16,397
outside of protected areas as well.

37
00:02:16,597 --> 00:02:19,532
For example, swallow populations
are being monitored in Europe

38
00:02:19,732 --> 00:02:21,856
in order to measure the impact
of pesticides.

39
00:02:22,056 --> 00:02:24,275
In the case of a protected area,

40
00:02:24,475 --> 00:02:28,790
ecological monitoring intends to show
that the goal of the protected area

41
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:32,941
its conservation, is being achieved.

42
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:37,274
So monitoring is, hence, intentional
and targeted.

43
00:02:37,474 --> 00:02:39,894
Indeed, and this is especially interesting

44
00:02:40,094 --> 00:02:43,092
to have ecological monitoring
in a protected area

45
00:02:43,292 --> 00:02:48,929
since it is, let's say usually, a significant
ecosystem on the national or regional level.

46
00:02:49,129 --> 00:02:53,530
It contains complete, or at least sufficiently
representative,

47
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:57,135
ecological processes
for successful research.

48
00:02:57,335 --> 00:02:59,902
Since the protected area is being managed,

49
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:03,369
it offers a good working base,
with means and infrastructures,

50
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:05,496
and, sometimes, available
and qualified staff.

51
00:03:06,902 --> 00:03:10,420
A protected area allows
for long term monitoring,

52
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,579
and can provide historic data,
which increases knowledge.

53
00:03:14,779 --> 00:03:17,405
It is a good place to experiment,

54
00:03:17,605 --> 00:03:20,685
and it allows for  a wide distribution
of information,

55
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:24,779
to other protected areas of the same category,
for instance.

56
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:28,770
It can also be a good medium for sharing
results with different targets,

57
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:32,421
in schools or  universities,
but also with the general public.

58
00:03:32,621 --> 00:03:36,647
Therefore, protected areas play an important
part in raising awareness for conservation.

59
00:03:37,777 --> 00:03:40,537
As we saw in the MOOC on Protected
Area Management,

60
00:03:40,737 --> 00:03:47,020
the management of protected areas is organized
according to a management plan,

61
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:50,621
defined in a participatory way
with clear goals

62
00:03:50,821 --> 00:03:54,681
concrete activities, and assigned
responsibilities.

63
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:59,609
Ecological monitoring has to be integrated
to the preparation of this plan

64
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:02,145
to ensure it will give relevant indicators,

65
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:05,014
but also that it will be effectively
implemented.

66
00:04:05,214 --> 00:04:08,114
It is useless to plan actions
that cannot be assessed

67
00:04:08,314 --> 00:04:11,242
or to associate them with indicators
that cannot be measured.

68
00:04:13,332 --> 00:04:18,984
Ecological monitoring must be discussed,
shared, and understood

69
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:22,355
by everybody involved in its implementation,

70
00:04:22,555 --> 00:04:27,915
and the park's manager needs to take ownership
of the plan from the very start.

71
00:04:28,996 --> 00:04:33,124
Ecological monitoring is obviously part
of the protected area management,

72
00:04:33,324 --> 00:04:36,407
but it is also one of the tools used
to measure

73
00:04:36,607 --> 00:04:38,417
the effectiveness of said management.

74
00:04:38,617 --> 00:04:41,108
As we saw in the MOOC on the Protected
Area Management,

75
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:44,656
monitoring needs to be subject
to protocols

76
00:04:44,856 --> 00:04:48,490
as well as to reliable methods
to be implemented.

77
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:55,144
It is important to note that it is one of the rare
possible sources of information

78
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:59,316
regarding the impact of our management
actions, or decisions.

79
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:03,518
For example, by showing the evolution
of the environment over time,

80
00:05:03,718 --> 00:05:06,718
according to what we do,
or what we did,

81
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:12,286
Therefore, regular monitoring of the state
of plants

82
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:14,113
can show that repetitive bush fires
in grasslands

83
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:16,874
lead to the disappearance of some useful
grass species.

84
00:05:17,074 --> 00:05:20,929
This finding will allow to choose
a better adapted season

85
00:05:21,129 --> 00:05:24,474
and a better periodicity for the ignition
of those fires.

86
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:30,240
Ecological monitoring accounts
for the state of the protected area

87
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,831
and identifies the pressures and threats
it is facing.

88
00:05:34,031 --> 00:05:38,318
It is important to base this ecological
monitoring

89
00:05:38,518 --> 00:05:43,631
on matters that will allow making the best
decisions in controlling those risks.

90
00:05:44,496 --> 00:05:49,248
Since means will necessarily be limited,
monitoring needs to be prioritized.

91
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:50,921
This is very important.

92
00:05:51,121 --> 00:05:55,818
This should not compete with more
urgent actions in the protected area.

93
00:05:56,018 --> 00:05:58,835
This reinforces the necessity
for good coordination

94
00:05:59,035 --> 00:06:00,906
with all those involved in the management,

95
00:06:01,106 --> 00:06:03,584
in and around the protected area,

96
00:06:03,784 --> 00:06:06,917
from the implementation
of the monitoring protocol onwards.

97
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,385
To make it simple,

98
00:06:08,585 --> 00:06:14,248
a useless ecological monitoring program
is worse than none at all.

99
00:06:15,307 --> 00:06:18,207
Ecological monitoring is also
and important tool

100
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:20,595
in training and motivating staff.

101
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:23,466
It empowers rangers, eco-guides,
volunteers,

102
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,806
and includes them in the management
process in whole,

103
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:30,756
not as mere implementers,
but as the providers of information

104
00:06:30,956 --> 00:06:34,013
that is at the very heart
of the decision-making process.

105
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:36,931
By giving access to new tools,

106
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:41,742
such as cyber-trackers, GPS,
or camera, like here on the screen,

107
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:45,335
ecological monitoring broadens
agents' skills,

108
00:06:45,535 --> 00:06:48,281
and since they are in touch
with researchers,

109
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:51,130
their personal knowledge
is being developed.

110
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:55,784
Monitoring is also a powerful tool for collecting
funds for a protected area.

111
00:06:55,984 --> 00:06:59,133
By providing reliable and transparent
information

112
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:02,524
regarding the state of the conservation
and the progress that has been made,

113
00:07:02,724 --> 00:07:06,909
it makes is possible to justify the use
of the funds that they have received.

114
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:11,921
Yes, in a documented way for once.

115
00:07:12,121 --> 00:07:14,574
By proposing new targets or activities,

116
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:17,308
it justifies access to additional
funding.

117
00:07:17,508 --> 00:07:19,975
It serves as a tool for accountability.

118
00:07:20,175 --> 00:07:22,284
We know that. We understand that.

119
00:07:22,484 --> 00:07:24,949
But also for prospection.

120
00:07:26,269 --> 00:07:29,839
Ecological monitoring is also a vector
for internal organization.

121
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:34,106
It strengthens the collaboration between different
departments of the protected area,

122
00:07:34,306 --> 00:07:38,887
like the admin, the research, the surveillance,
communication, training departments, and so on,

123
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:44,234
because it is multidisciplinary and needs
everybody's input to be successful.

124
00:07:44,434 --> 00:07:50,469
For example, storing collected data
is key to monitoring sustainability.

125
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,405
To process this information within
the protected area,

126
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:55,427
and store all the data,

127
00:07:55,627 --> 00:07:58,542
the entire organization is engaged.

128
00:07:59,692 --> 00:08:01,346
Beyond the management aspects,

129
00:08:01,546 --> 00:08:05,382
ecological monitoring, of course,
has its own distinctive role,

130
00:08:05,582 --> 00:08:08,271
which is to inform on species
and ecosystems.

131
00:08:08,471 --> 00:08:09,550
Now, we know that.

132
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:12,377
You get to know what species inhabit
a protected area,

133
00:08:12,577 --> 00:08:16,272
in what numbers, during which seasons,
at what places, and so on.

134
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:18,808
On this basis,

135
00:08:19,008 --> 00:08:23,352
ecological monitoring with measure
the variations in space and time,

136
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:25,175
short, medium, long term.

137
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:27,841
You can then understand the interactions,

138
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,588
measure the impacts of the pressures,

139
00:08:30,788 --> 00:08:33,339
and better estimate samples
to be taken.

140
00:08:34,565 --> 00:08:38,243
For example, monitoring elephant populations
within the Kruger National Park,

141
00:08:38,443 --> 00:08:40,855
and monitoring their impacts on plants,

142
00:08:41,055 --> 00:08:46,319
has allowed determining the threshold at which
said population needs to be maintained at

143
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:48,837
in order to prevent damages on the ecosystem

144
00:08:49,037 --> 00:08:52,580
that will also be detrimental
to other species.

145
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:55,352
The next step is to figure out how to do it,

146
00:08:55,552 --> 00:08:56,860
but that's another story.

147
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:02,110
Ecological monitoring is crucial
in the PA management process.

148
00:09:02,310 --> 00:09:05,761
It is quite surprising to find
that many parks

149
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:09,466
don't have a monitoring protocol
in place at all.

150
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:11,910


151
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:10,979
Others have one,

152
00:09:11,179 --> 00:09:15,129
but it doesn't give any information
on the state of the values

153
00:09:15,329 --> 00:09:18,847
or it is based on outdated techniques,

154
00:09:19,047 --> 00:09:23,904
or the produced results are not understood
or shared or used.

155
00:09:24,104 --> 00:09:27,908
And this is not the case in a minority
of sites, unfortunately.

156
00:09:28,108 --> 00:09:32,659
it's the situation of a vast majority
of protected areas,

157
00:09:32,859 --> 00:09:36,545
where management has turned into a plain
and systematic repetition of actions

158
00:09:36,745 --> 00:09:40,092
with no effort put into assisting
the impacts, actually.

159
00:09:40,292 --> 00:09:41,657
Sadly.

160
00:09:41,857 --> 00:09:43,453
So sad.
