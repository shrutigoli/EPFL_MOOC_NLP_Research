Hello and welcome to this
MOOC on ecological monitoring.
This MOOC is about a fundamental tool for protected areas management.
It will help us understand what ecological monitoring is, what it's benefits and limitations are and how to implement it.
How to use the results to improve our impacts on conservation and so on.
In the first unit we will introduce the concept of ecological monitoring.
This will help us better understand the conditions of such monitoring; why you would do it?
What is it for? How are the values, attributes and indicators defined?
What methods should be used?
At what cost?
What kind of sample should we target and so and so.
The second unit will look into the useful statistical methods to carry out ecological monitoring.
We will talk about the general statistical concepts and also about uses applied to monitoring.
The third unit will introduce different monitoring techniques used on the field.
How to monitor the ecosystems or the vegetation, mammals, birds, directly or indirectly.
We will also present some specific methods that can be applied to carnivores, primates, migratory species, et cetera.
Finally in the fourth unit we will give practical examples to illustrate the concept; ecological monitoring applied to peer networks, marine, terrestrial sites, forest, savanna, wetlands, targeted species.
In other words a representative sample of real-life possibilities.
There, now it's your turn.
Don't forget about the quizzes and of course the exams after each unit.
They will certainly help you making good progress.
