1
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:12,007
A complete ecological
monitoring protocol implies

2
00:00:12,234 --> 00:00:17,884
value, ecological attributes,
indicators to assess the attributes

3
00:00:18,117 --> 00:00:21,904
but also a data collection method
and a sampling plan

4
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:28,978
that are effective, precise, realistic,
feasible, unrepeatable over time

5
00:00:29,232 --> 00:00:32,907
whoever the people involved in
it's implementation may be.

6
00:00:33,577 --> 00:00:36,265
Now the question is
can all this be done in view of

7
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:39,215
the available resources
within a protected area?

8
00:00:39,419 --> 00:00:41,282
So let's see what
resources are need to

9
00:00:41,461 --> 00:00:43,561
implement such
a protocol.

10
00:00:44,443 --> 00:00:47,493
A data collection method comes
with specific equipment

11
00:00:47,706 --> 00:00:52,094
for the collection process,
storage and data analysis.

12
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:56,771
Sometimes staff needs to be
trained specifically

13
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,800
to be able to use
this equipment properly.

14
00:01:00,112 --> 00:01:02,012
The monitoring process
will consequently

15
00:01:02,198 --> 00:01:04,973
have a cost in purchasing
and maintaining the equipment

16
00:01:05,181 --> 00:01:07,394
but also in the time spent
training the staff

17
00:01:07,618 --> 00:01:10,193
in charge of collecting
and analyzing the data.

18
00:01:11,284 --> 00:01:15,534
For instance, buying your GPS
or camera trap

19
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:20,081
generates an expense of
a couple of hundred euros per device

20
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:24,936
to which the battery, the transfer
and data processing software

21
00:01:25,177 --> 00:01:27,052
need to
be added.

22
00:01:27,452 --> 00:01:30,989
This can seem a detail for certain
parks but it can also be

23
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:34,866
too expensive orders 
where simple maps are still used

24
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:37,563
for localizing the
area of observation.

25
00:01:37,801 --> 00:01:41,514
It's not very precise, indeed
but of course it's also,

26
00:01:41,764 --> 00:01:43,789
it cost's
almost nothing.

27
00:01:45,094 --> 00:01:48,256
Training the staff can be
a rewarding role

28
00:01:48,507 --> 00:01:50,920
but it can sometimes
be useless.

29
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:54,693
It is a case when trained
agents are transferred

30
00:01:54,924 --> 00:01:57,374
before having the
opportunity or the time

31
00:01:57,582 --> 00:02:00,582
to particularly apply
their knowledge.

32
00:02:01,035 --> 00:02:03,860
Finally, and this is important.
You need to check if the staff

33
00:02:04,049 --> 00:02:06,549
have the ability to fill in
the sheet properly or to

34
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,487
implement other way
of reporting that

35
00:02:08,668 --> 00:02:11,006
are adapted to
the observer's level.

36
00:02:11,443 --> 00:02:14,981
As for the chosen sampling plan,
it will determine

37
00:02:15,346 --> 00:02:18,046
the number of data 
collecting campaigns

38
00:02:18,279 --> 00:02:22,091
to do in different places
as well as their frequency

39
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:23,981
during the year,
for instance.

40
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,417
This will have a cost
in working time, travelling,

41
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,548
mobilizing vehicles,
logistics, et cetera.

42
00:02:33,141 --> 00:02:37,553
For instance, the table shown here
compares the sampling plan of

43
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:41,529
3 different approaches to monitor 
the birds during breeding season.

44
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:45,440
The contact point approach is
the least time consuming

45
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:49,235
over the year. It's about 8 hours
of work but also

46
00:02:49,477 --> 00:02:52,127
the one giving the least
detailed results.

47
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:57,461
This approach will be most adapted
in places with few staff at hand 

48
00:02:57,758 --> 00:03:01,908
to collect data or if the dense
vegetation prevents access

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,458
to certain key sampling sites
that would be required

50
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:11,984
when using the tools or approaches,
the grid plan and the transect plan.

51
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,288
The cost of an ecological
monitoring protocol

52
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:19,641
as a time factor and can have an
outsourced expertise cost

53
00:03:19,841 --> 00:03:23,129
if there is a need to implement
some specific monitoring steps that

54
00:03:23,332 --> 00:03:27,019
the protected area staff itself
wont be able to do alone.

55
00:03:27,746 --> 00:03:30,634
To guarantee it's
long-term sustainability,

56
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:33,815
it is however better for
the ecological monitoring

57
00:03:34,168 --> 00:03:36,543
to be done
by the manager himself

58
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,995
along with his properly
trained staff.

59
00:03:40,676 --> 00:03:44,163
If the ecological monitoring
protocol is clear and unique

60
00:03:44,403 --> 00:03:48,103
the manager will be able
to do all the sampling,

61
00:03:48,354 --> 00:03:52,254
data collection, data analysis
procedures himself

62
00:03:52,462 --> 00:03:55,737
and this contributes to
the global strengthening

63
00:03:55,972 --> 00:03:58,022
of the park's
capabilities.

64
00:03:58,483 --> 00:04:00,970
In short, you need to choose
a protocol that matches

65
00:04:01,196 --> 00:04:03,434
the available human and
financial resources

66
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,981
in a protected area
in the medium haul

67
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:08,804
while making sure this
protocol is effective enough

68
00:04:09,006 --> 00:04:14,019
to detect indicators to assess
with as little bias as possible.

69
00:04:14,982 --> 00:04:19,195
Estimating the monitoring cost
should be done while planning

70
00:04:19,448 --> 00:04:22,985
and implementing
the ecological monitoring process.
