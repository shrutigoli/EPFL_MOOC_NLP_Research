1
00:00:09,174 --> 00:00:10,474
As the title suggests

2
00:00:10,674 --> 00:00:13,674
this is a short introduction to some
of the main notions of statistics.

3
00:00:14,426 --> 00:00:16,489
The emphasis will be 
on broad concepts

4
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:19,689
rather than on specific techniques
or technical details.

5
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:22,413
But, what is statistics?

6
00:00:23,388 --> 00:00:25,688
Statistics is about learning
from data

7
00:00:25,888 --> 00:00:27,713
and the presence of uncertainty.

8
00:00:28,196 --> 00:00:29,746
To put it more eloquently,

9
00:00:29,946 --> 00:00:32,496
I will quote one of the founding
fathers of modern statistics

10
00:00:32,807 --> 00:00:34,357
Ronald A. Fisher.

11
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:38,594
We may at once admit that any inference 
from the particular to the general

12
00:00:38,949 --> 00:00:41,774
<i>must be attended with some
degree of uncertainty,</i>

13
00:00:42,338 --> 00:00:44,675
<i>but this is not the same
as to admit</i>

14
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:48,213
<i>that such inference cannot be
absolutely rigorous.</i>

15
00:00:48,609 --> 00:00:51,009
<i>For the nature and degree 
of uncertainty</i>

16
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:54,045
<i>may itself be capable of
rigorous expression.</i>

17
00:00:54,462 --> 00:00:56,874
The object of study will be
a population.

18
00:00:57,074 --> 00:00:59,312
This is the general
in Fisher's quotation.

19
00:00:59,512 --> 00:01:03,437
This population could be a physical
population, of living and inanimate objects.

20
00:01:03,637 --> 00:01:05,612
For instance, residents 
of a country,

21
00:01:05,812 --> 00:01:09,062
animals in a region, batteries 
produced by a factory.

22
00:01:09,473 --> 00:01:11,335
It could also be a conceptual 
population.

23
00:01:11,630 --> 00:01:13,980
Population of all possible
coin flips

24
00:01:14,167 --> 00:01:15,505
with a given coin.

25
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:19,330
Now in either case, you're interested
in a characteristic that is measurable

26
00:01:19,530 --> 00:01:21,430
on each member of the population.

27
00:01:21,908 --> 00:01:23,908
This we call a statistical variable.

28
00:01:24,356 --> 00:01:27,956
If we knew the value of the variable
for each member of the population,

29
00:01:28,218 --> 00:01:29,655
we would know all.

30
00:01:29,855 --> 00:01:33,105
In fact, it will suffice to know 
what proportion of the population

31
00:01:33,305 --> 00:01:35,768
has a variable value
within a certain range

32
00:01:35,968 --> 00:01:37,518
for any given range.

33
00:01:37,718 --> 00:01:41,155
This is known as the distribution of
the variable at the population level.

34
00:01:41,752 --> 00:01:45,040
For conceptual populations, for
instance the population of coin flips

35
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:47,802
we would like to know the
probability of a certain value

36
00:01:48,002 --> 00:01:49,690
in a given range of values.

37
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,002
For instance, what proportion
of a country's population

38
00:01:53,202 --> 00:01:54,877
has income below a certain level?

39
00:01:55,077 --> 00:01:57,177
In order to decide on
taxation policy.

40
00:01:57,539 --> 00:02:00,351
What is the proportion of voters
favoring a certain candidate?

41
00:02:00,551 --> 00:02:02,826
If we'd like to predict the result
of an election.

42
00:02:03,532 --> 00:02:05,920
What are the proportion of different
blood groups in a region?

43
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,207
In order to stock it's
hospital reserves.

44
00:02:08,608 --> 00:02:09,895
What is the bias of a coin?

45
00:02:10,095 --> 00:02:12,633
In order to decide whether we could
use it to play heads or tails.

46
00:02:13,385 --> 00:02:15,947
What is the proportion of batteries
in a certain batch

47
00:02:16,147 --> 00:02:19,147
whose lifetime is smaller than
some particular duration?

48
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:22,911
However, it is typically infeasible
to measure the value

49
00:02:23,111 --> 00:02:25,586
of the variable for reaching
every population member?

50
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:28,511
Instead, we can only measure
the variable on a subset

51
00:02:28,736 --> 00:02:30,836
of the population called a sample.

52
00:02:31,347 --> 00:02:33,710
This is chosen at random 
in order to ensure

53
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:36,160
that it is representative of
the entire population.

54
00:02:36,481 --> 00:02:39,281
This is the particular 
in Fisher's quotation.

55
00:02:39,886 --> 00:02:43,199
Thus, the idea is that we can(INAUDIBLE) 
the distribution of the variable

56
00:02:43,399 --> 00:02:45,886
at the level of sample we would
like to use this,

57
00:02:46,086 --> 00:02:48,799
in order to understand the distribution
at the level of population.

58
00:02:49,915 --> 00:02:52,528
Now the main questions 
of statistical inference are,

59
00:02:52,926 --> 00:02:56,601
how can we infer the distribution
of the variable at the population level

60
00:02:56,801 --> 00:02:58,026
from the sample?

61
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:00,971
How can we quantify the
associated uncertainty

62
00:03:01,171 --> 00:03:02,909
in our inference? After all,

63
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,510
different samples will produce
different measurements.

64
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:07,423
Leading to such uncertainty.

65
00:03:07,623 --> 00:03:11,098
Statistical variables can be 
qualitative, or quantitative.

66
00:03:12,086 --> 00:03:14,786
Qualitative variables can be
nominal and ordinal.

67
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:17,920
Nominal variables have 
no intrinsic ordering.

68
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:20,695
An individual's blood type,
or sex for example.

69
00:03:21,484 --> 00:03:24,109
Ordinal variables on the other hand
admit a ranking.

70
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:27,309
For instance, the size of a product,
small, medium, or large.

71
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:31,453
Quantitative variables can be 
continuous or discrete.

72
00:03:31,918 --> 00:03:33,606
The height or weight of 
an individual,

73
00:03:33,806 --> 00:03:35,493
the lifetime of a battery,

74
00:03:35,693 --> 00:03:38,943
or the proportions of individuals
voting for a certain electoral candidate,

75
00:03:39,143 --> 00:03:41,768
are all examples of continuous
random variables.

76
00:03:42,295 --> 00:03:44,945
They can take on any value
from some interval

77
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:48,345
and there is no discrete list of 
values that we can choose them from.

78
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:51,690
The number of sunny days
between consecutive rainy days.

79
00:03:51,925 --> 00:03:54,138
The number of bacteria
in a water bottle.

80
00:03:54,338 --> 00:03:58,050
And the number of visits to a web page
during the course of the day, on the other hand

81
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:01,050
are all examples of discrete
random variables.

82
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:05,377
They can take values from a discrete
list of prescribed values.

83
00:04:06,309 --> 00:04:09,822
Now quantitative variables can be
converted into qualitative variables.

84
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,180
For instance, ones blood pressure
could be converted

85
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:16,943
to the qualitative variable,
low, normal, and high.

86
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:19,642
Going in the opposite direction,

87
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:21,217
is usually a bad idea.

88
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:24,238
For example, converting
the blood groups

89
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:27,651
into physical numbers, makes
very little sense.

90
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:30,529
Even worse, it creates 
the temptation

91
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:33,104
to carry out numerical
operation on them

92
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:35,329
that would lead to some
absurd results.
