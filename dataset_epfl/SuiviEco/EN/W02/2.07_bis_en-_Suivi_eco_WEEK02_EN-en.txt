Let's get back to our elephant population.
We want to know it's age, which is the ecological attribute we want to measure.
Therefore, we will be working on the sample.
We measure the age of all 13 elephants in the sample.
This way, we will easily obtain an estimate of the samples average age, and a standard deviation that will give information on the confidence we can have in this estimate.
Then, we determine a range of values in which there is
95% chance to obtain the average age of the elephants, which we call
The Confidence Intervals.
In the sample, where the mean is 19.3 and the standard deviation is 16, all the possible values of the mean are from between more or less
2 times the standard deviation divided by the root of 30.
Here we can see that this value is quite high, and not that useful.
This is related to the fact that the sample is very small.
If the size of the sample increases, the confidence intervals decreases as this interval is inversely proportionate to the square root of the sample size.
Thus, if we take 4 times as many elephants from the sample, the length of the confidence interval will be divided at least in half.
To do this, let's take a sample with 4 times as many individuals.
The group is now made of
52 elephants instead of 13, and it's mean is still 19.3 years.
But now, deviance is 159, and the standard deviation is 12.
So, the confidence interval decreases.
The estimate gets more precise.
