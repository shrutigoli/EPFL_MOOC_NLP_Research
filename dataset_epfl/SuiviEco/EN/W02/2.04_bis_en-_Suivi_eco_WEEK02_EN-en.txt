Numbers are important, being median, standard deviation, but sometimes graphs can be more explicit. 
As we consider qualitative variables, let's use elephant color as the ecological attribute we want to adopt and the same frequency table we worked with previously. 
The bar chart gives the absolute frequency of each value.
Here, five grey, three white and two pink. 
The pie chart expresses the relative frequency of these values on a disk representing 100% of their distribution.
Now, for quantitative variables, let's once again consider our elephant edges as the ecological attributes.
And again, let's take the sample of 13 elephants of which we already know the ages. 
On the X axis, we set elephant ages in intervals of, let say five years.
On the vertical axis, we put the number of elephants present in each category. 
This is how we draw histograms showing the age dispersion of the sample. 
If we change the interval to ten years, the shape of the histogram changes. 
Interval sizes affect the final visual result and this can interfere with interpretation.
So be aware. 
We can also draw a boxplot from the sample by taking the quartile and median data and by drawing whiskers that measure 1.5 times the weight of the box. 
This gives a another image of the value distribution that does not depend on changing parameters. 
In our case, the sample distribution shows skewness to the right hand side 
Elephants are whole with two outliers on both sides of the whiskers.
