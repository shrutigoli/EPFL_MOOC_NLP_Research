1
00:00:09,475 --> 00:00:13,474
Numbers are important,
being median, standard deviation, 

2
00:00:13,668 --> 00:00:17,093
but sometimes graphs 
can be more explicit. 

3
00:00:17,675 --> 00:00:20,100
As we consider 
qualitative variables, 

4
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:23,347
let's use elephant color 
as the ecological attribute

5
00:00:23,542 --> 00:00:26,642
we want to adopt
and the same frequency table

6
00:00:26,876 --> 00:00:28,976
we worked with previously. 

7
00:00:29,963 --> 00:00:34,376
The bar chart gives the
absolute frequency of each value.

8
00:00:34,582 --> 00:00:39,619
Here, five grey,
three white and two pink. 

9
00:00:40,376 --> 00:00:43,552
The pie chart expresses 
the relative frequency 

10
00:00:43,737 --> 00:00:45,699
of these values on a disk

11
00:00:45,925 --> 00:00:49,988
representing 100% 
of their distribution.

12
00:00:50,826 --> 00:00:54,914
Now, for quantitative variables, 
let's once again 

13
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:59,624
consider our elephant edges 
as the ecological attributes.

14
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:03,684
And again, let's take 
the sample of 13 elephants 

15
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:07,530
of which we already know
the ages. 

16
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:14,602
On the X axis, we set elephant ages
in intervals of, let say five years.

17
00:01:15,081 --> 00:01:19,093
On the vertical axis, 
we put the number of elephants

18
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:21,057
present in each category. 

19
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:25,765
This is how we draw histograms
showing the age dispersion

20
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:27,590
of the sample. 

21
00:01:27,804 --> 00:01:30,842
If we change the interval 
to ten years, 

22
00:01:31,043 --> 00:01:33,743
the shape of the histogram
changes. 

23
00:01:33,948 --> 00:01:37,835
Interval sizes affect 
the final visual result

24
00:01:38,067 --> 00:01:41,067
and this can interfere 
with interpretation.

25
00:01:41,257 --> 00:01:42,419
So be aware. 

26
00:01:43,037 --> 00:01:47,062
We can also draw a boxplot
from the sample 

27
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:50,109
by taking the quartile
and median data

28
00:01:50,347 --> 00:01:54,509
and by drawing whiskers that 
measure 1.5 times 

29
00:01:54,713 --> 00:01:56,825
the weight of the box. 

30
00:01:57,662 --> 00:02:01,024
This gives a another image
of the value distribution

31
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:04,424
that does not depend 
on changing parameters. 

32
00:02:04,639 --> 00:02:08,789
In our case, the sample distribution
shows skewness 

33
00:02:08,992 --> 00:02:10,979
to the right hand side 

34
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:12,636
Elephants are whole

35
00:02:12,819 --> 00:02:17,144
with two outliers on both sides 
of the whiskers.
