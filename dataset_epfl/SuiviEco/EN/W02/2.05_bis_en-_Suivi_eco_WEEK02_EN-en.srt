00:00:09,185 --> 00:00:12,535
In this unit we saw
how to use a variable

2
00:00:12,667 --> 00:00:15,667
distribution as observed
within the sample

3
00:00:15,808 --> 00:00:19,395
to try to deduce the variable
or ecological attributes

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,844
distribution at the scale
of the population.

5
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:27,743
For a quantitative variable,
such as the age of elephants

6
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,178
let's take a sample of which
the histogram of age distribution

7
00:00:32,287 --> 00:00:35,287
in five year beams
would be as follows.

8
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,195
By increasing the sample size
we can reduce the beam width

9
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:42,280
to three years for example

10
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:44,204
and be more accurate.

11
00:00:44,328 --> 00:00:48,578
Then we try to identify
a curve representing

12
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:51,384
the law of population
that can be expressed

13
00:00:51,476 --> 00:00:55,663
by a relatively easy
statistical function.

14
00:00:56,149 --> 00:00:59,674
For discreet variables we don't
want to replace the histogram

15
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:04,981
with the curve, since the values
are distributed into separated beams

16
00:01:05,094 --> 00:01:09,094
but we could, however, determine
the law of the population.

17
00:01:09,556 --> 00:01:13,756
In all cases, the difficulty is
to identify a suitable formula

18
00:01:13,896 --> 00:01:19,009
that depends on unknown parameters
that one would need to estimate.

19
00:01:19,569 --> 00:01:24,619
This is where the sample comes
in handy as it allows choosing

20
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:27,875
sensibly the most treatable model
to describe the population

21
00:01:28,013 --> 00:01:31,013
and to calculate the value
of the parameter on which

22
00:01:31,162 --> 00:01:33,087
the model is based.

23
00:01:33,324 --> 00:01:37,724
One way of doing it is to consider
the sample distribution to find

24
00:01:37,858 --> 00:01:40,670
the law that comes nearest to it.

25
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,712
Here for example we
took the normal law.

26
00:01:43,844 --> 00:01:45,844
Determining the value
of the parameters

27
00:01:45,925 --> 00:01:49,925
isndone by estimating
the value from the sample.

28
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:53,854
In this case, we're allowed
to identify the values of

29
00:01:53,977 --> 00:01:56,189
the standard deviation
and the mean

30
00:01:56,264 --> 00:01:58,351
and their degree of confidence.

31
00:01:58,432 --> 00:02:01,982
We will see these in more
detail in the next unit.

32
00:02:02,424 --> 00:02:05,774
The benefit of this type of
model is that it can give

33
00:02:05,878 --> 00:02:08,191
precious information in theory.

34
00:02:08,307 --> 00:02:15,020
For example, that 95% of individuals
will fall in two standard deviations

35
00:02:15,122 --> 00:02:19,084
and 99% in three standard deviations

36
00:02:19,222 --> 00:02:23,472
provided of course the population
follows the model in place.
