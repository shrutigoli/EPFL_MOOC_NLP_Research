The Jolly method is mentioned several times in the book hence this additional unit that briefly introduces it.
It is particularly useful when it comes to analyzing data from aerial surveys and we will take the following example to provide details on the Jolly 1 calculation method.
Let's consider a
1000km2 park.
We want to sample at random
30 20km long transects by 500m wide.
In other words, a 250m stripe on each side of the plain.
Each transect covers a 10km2 surface.
In the park are the total of 100 of them theoretically to cover it's entire surface.
The following table gives the number of elephants counted on each transect,
491 in total.
The mean of the samples is the sum of elephants per sample divided by n and that is
16.4 elephants per transect.
The total population is
100 times this mean.
There are 100 possible samples in the park so we are
1640 elephants in total.
The sample variance calculated following the usual method is
144.9 and the population variation is deduced by the formula here so a total of 33 810.
Hence the almost 184 standard deviation for the population.
Now, we can calculate the confidence interval around the mean and that is 1.96 times standard deviation meaning 360.
The Jolly 2 method uses the same principles but deals with sampling where the transect land are viable.
This adds viability within the transects to the viability that already exists between the transects.
