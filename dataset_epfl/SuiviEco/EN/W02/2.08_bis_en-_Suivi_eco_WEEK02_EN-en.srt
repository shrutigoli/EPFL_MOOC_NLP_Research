1
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,257
To find the parameter

2
00:00:10,282 --> 00:00:12,177
of the population distribution law,

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:14,299
we can proceed by checking

4
00:00:14,312 --> 00:00:16,496
if the one we think to be right

5
00:00:16,509 --> 00:00:18,066
truly is right.

6
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:20,551
The parameter we estimate

7
00:00:20,573 --> 00:00:22,424
should then belong to an interval

8
00:00:22,436 --> 00:00:23,867
of plausible values.

9
00:00:23,879 --> 00:00:26,005
To test this,

10
00:00:26,018 --> 00:00:28,404
we will take a sample and see

11
00:00:28,426 --> 00:00:30,488
if the parameter's measured value

12
00:00:30,523 --> 00:00:33,523
is consistent with our supposition.

13
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:37,175
This is a hypothesis test.

14
00:00:38,072 --> 00:00:40,058
Let's again have a look

15
00:00:40,071 --> 00:00:42,730
at our elephant population.

16
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:46,062
We think, by observing it over time,

17
00:00:46,074 --> 00:00:49,667
that it's mean age is 25 years,

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,244
and we can see that

19
00:00:51,256 --> 00:00:53,845
it has a normal distribution.

20
00:00:53,994 --> 00:00:58,695
We choose significance level α=0.05.

21
00:00:58,757 --> 00:01:03,364
For our hypothesis, H0 is true,

22
00:01:03,376 --> 00:01:04,516
and the difference

23
00:01:04,529 --> 00:01:06,065
between the sample mean

24
00:01:06,098 --> 00:01:07,789
and the population mean

25
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:15,082
should be under 1.96 α/√n.

26
00:01:15,557 --> 00:01:18,830
Now, at random, let's take a sample

27
00:01:18,843 --> 00:01:21,584
a sample of 52 individuals

28
00:01:21,596 --> 00:01:23,165
from the population.

29
00:01:23,178 --> 00:01:26,165
The age values are indicated here.

30
00:01:27,418 --> 00:01:30,681
The sample mean is 19.3

31
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,854
and the standard-deviation is 12.6.

32
00:01:34,988 --> 00:01:37,988
The √n is 7.2.

33
00:01:38,511 --> 00:01:44,807
We have 19.3-25=5.7

34
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:54,415
and 1.96 (12.6/7.2)=3.43.

35
00:01:55,225 --> 00:01:58,755
H0 is not verified

36
00:01:59,053 --> 00:02:02,252
and we can reject the hypothesis

37
00:02:02,264 --> 00:02:04,054
that the average age

38
00:02:04,066 --> 00:02:06,711
of the population is 25 years.
