1
00:00:09,627 --> 00:00:12,027
Let's get back to our sample
of elephants

2
00:00:12,227 --> 00:00:13,502
in the park.

3
00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:15,915
When we look at a qualitative
variable such as

4
00:00:16,115 --> 00:00:19,590
the color of elephants, we will
obtain 3 categories.

5
00:00:19,790 --> 00:00:22,790
For example, green, white, and pink.

6
00:00:23,282 --> 00:00:26,607
Our sample is made up
of 10 elephants.

7
00:00:26,937 --> 00:00:29,875
The frequency table gives
the elephants distribution

8
00:00:30,075 --> 00:00:31,512
among these categories.

9
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:35,112
It is a simple descriptive piece
of information.

10
00:00:35,461 --> 00:00:38,974
The absolute frequency measures
how many elephants

11
00:00:39,372 --> 00:00:41,234
are present in each category.

12
00:00:41,434 --> 00:00:45,397
For example, 5 green,
2 pink, and 3 white.

13
00:00:45,861 --> 00:00:49,761
The relative frequency gives
the proportion of each category.

14
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:54,572
50% green, 20% pink,
and 30% white.

15
00:00:55,293 --> 00:00:59,455
How this shows that there are
more green elephants,

16
00:00:59,885 --> 00:01:01,323
is the absolute frequency.

17
00:01:01,523 --> 00:01:03,623
And they represent half the sample

18
00:01:03,823 --> 00:01:06,160
and this gives their 
relative frequency.

19
00:01:06,543 --> 00:01:10,268
Now, let's have another look at
a discrete quantitative variable,

20
00:01:10,468 --> 00:01:13,843
the ecological attribute Age,
of the elephants.

21
00:01:14,413 --> 00:01:17,200
We choose a sample of 13 elephants

22
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,438
and we determine their age.

23
00:01:19,638 --> 00:01:23,675
Then, we arrange the elephants
in ascending order of age.

24
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:26,550
This is called, Statistics order.

25
00:01:26,957 --> 00:01:29,582
Now, we are able to visualize

26
00:01:29,782 --> 00:01:33,207
the distribution of the sample
according to the ascending value

27
00:01:33,407 --> 00:01:34,844
of the attribute.

28
00:01:35,282 --> 00:01:38,144
The next step, to better understand
this attribute

29
00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:41,344
is to know where the center
of the sample is.

30
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:45,903
This is a measure of location, and
how the sample values are distributed

31
00:01:46,103 --> 00:01:47,228
around the center.

32
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:49,478
This is a measure of dispersion.

33
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:53,553
The mean gives the average age
of the elephants.

34
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:56,603
It is calculated by dividing
some of the ages

35
00:01:56,803 --> 00:01:59,241
with the number of elephants
monitored.

36
00:01:59,565 --> 00:02:02,665
The median splits the population 
in half.

37
00:02:03,002 --> 00:02:06,952
It is not affected by the variation
of values of the attribute itself.

38
00:02:07,602 --> 00:02:10,814
The variance gives a distribution
of attribute values

39
00:02:11,014 --> 00:02:12,152
around the mean.

40
00:02:12,352 --> 00:02:14,877
It is obtained by calculating
the sum of the value

41
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:17,239
square distances with the mean.

42
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:20,127
And then we divide it by N.

43
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:23,714
The standard deviation will be
the square root of the variance.

44
00:02:23,914 --> 00:02:27,214
It expresses the distribution
at the same scale

45
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:28,689
as the value itself.

46
00:02:29,276 --> 00:02:32,476
Finally, the sample can be
subdivided into Quantiles.

47
00:02:32,894 --> 00:02:35,619
Usually, Quartiles are often used.

48
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:39,994
In this case, each group gathers
around 25% of the sample.

49
00:02:40,322 --> 00:02:43,147
This gives more detail information
about the sample

50
00:02:43,518 --> 00:02:45,530
by showing its symmetry 
to the mean

51
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:48,005
which the variance alone doesn't do.

52
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:51,469
Here, we can see that the sample
of elephants (INAUDIBLE)

53
00:02:51,669 --> 00:02:54,256
a greater number of old animals.
