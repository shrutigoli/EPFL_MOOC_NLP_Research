1
00:00:09,427 --> 00:00:09,937
The problem

2
00:00:09,949 --> 00:00:11,255
with a point estimator is that

3
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:13,435
no matter how accurate it is,

4
00:00:13,438 --> 00:00:15,169
it will almost never be

5
00:00:15,174 --> 00:00:16,862
exactly right.

6
00:00:16,866 --> 00:00:18,116
For instance, we know that,

7
00:00:18,118 --> 00:00:20,248
had we chosen a different sample,

8
00:00:20,315 --> 00:00:21,003
we would have obtained

9
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:22,341
a slightly different value

10
00:00:22,373 --> 00:00:24,336
of our point estimator.

11
00:00:24,466 --> 00:00:25,616
A different approach

12
00:00:25,596 --> 00:00:27,359
than point estimation, is to give

13
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:29,070
a range of plausible values

14
00:00:29,072 --> 00:00:30,498
rather than a single value

15
00:00:30,506 --> 00:00:32,044
for the unknown parameter.

16
00:00:32,226 --> 00:00:32,714
This comes

17
00:00:32,770 --> 00:00:34,260
in the form of the interval.

18
00:00:34,613 --> 00:00:36,500
If we had many samples at hand,

19
00:00:36,546 --> 00:00:37,434
perhaps we'd use

20
00:00:37,463 --> 00:00:38,988
the different estimates obtained

21
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,804
to find a plausible range,

22
00:00:41,075 --> 00:00:42,800
similar to the image on the right...

23
00:00:43,232 --> 00:00:44,582
but we only have one.

24
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:46,225
So, what we need to do,

25
00:00:46,227 --> 00:00:47,626
is to take advantage

26
00:00:47,638 --> 00:00:48,527
of our knowledge

27
00:00:48,546 --> 00:00:49,983
of the sampling distribution

28
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:52,217
of the estimator, in order to produce

29
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:53,658
such an interval.

30
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:55,376
What are the characteristics

31
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:57,242
that such an interval should possess?

32
00:00:57,472 --> 00:00:58,986
Well, obviously, we would like

33
00:00:59,002 --> 00:01:00,540
they be reasonably short.

34
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:02,677
The shorter, the more informative.

35
00:01:02,917 --> 00:01:04,443
A long interval says that

36
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:05,682
many values are plausible,

37
00:01:05,688 --> 00:01:07,701
giving little useful information.

38
00:01:07,876 --> 00:01:09,726
But a short interval narrows down

39
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:10,989
our choice of parameter.

40
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,306
But at the same time, the interval

41
00:01:13,344 --> 00:01:15,384
should come with some guarantees.

42
00:01:15,412 --> 00:01:16,974
We'd like to be quite confident that

43
00:01:16,988 --> 00:01:18,038
the interval constructed

44
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:19,395
on the basis of the sample

45
00:01:19,502 --> 00:01:21,441
actually contains the true value.

46
00:01:21,977 --> 00:01:22,863
For instance,

47
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:23,562
we'd like to have

48
00:01:23,568 --> 00:01:25,256
a method for constructing intervals

49
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:27,647
that guarantees that 95%

50
00:01:27,649 --> 00:01:30,100
of all possible samples will produce

51
00:01:30,109 --> 00:01:30,745
an interval

52
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:32,159
containing the true value.

53
00:01:32,428 --> 00:01:34,916
Such an interval, if we can find it,

54
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,670
will be called

55
00:01:35,674 --> 00:01:37,775
the 95% confidence interval.

56
00:01:38,144 --> 00:01:39,631
Let's see how we could construct

57
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:41,151
such an interval.

58
00:01:41,242 --> 00:01:42,804
Let's suppose that we have a sample,

59
00:01:42,823 --> 00:01:44,499
say x1,...,xn,

60
00:01:44,502 --> 00:01:45,740
from a population model

61
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:48,262
according to some model: f (x; θ).

62
00:01:48,851 --> 00:01:51,137
We construct the estimator of θ

63
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:53,157
by maximum likelihood estimation.

64
00:01:53,201 --> 00:01:56,201
Let's call this θ^(x1,...,xn).

65
00:01:56,539 --> 00:01:57,838
We know that this should be

66
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,368
close to the true parameter.

67
00:01:59,390 --> 00:02:00,602
It makes sense to anchor

68
00:02:00,635 --> 00:02:01,698
a confidence interval

69
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,257
around this estimator.

70
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:05,068
The interval we seek

71
00:02:05,071 --> 00:02:06,209
would thus be centered at

72
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:09,296
θ^(x1,...,xn) ± δ.

73
00:02:09,377 --> 00:02:10,864
How exactly should we

74
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:12,488
choose that constant, in order to

75
00:02:12,489 --> 00:02:15,351
guarantee 95% confidence?

76
00:02:15,595 --> 00:02:17,833
To see how, we need to revisit

77
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:19,082
the sampling distribution

78
00:02:19,092 --> 00:02:20,222
of θ^(x1,...xn).

79
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:21,659
Recall that

80
00:02:21,671 --> 00:02:23,079
for large enough samples,

81
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:24,567
the sampling distribution

82
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:26,348
of the maximum likelihood estimator

83
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:27,785
is approximately normal,

84
00:02:27,797 --> 00:02:29,473
and this is independent

85
00:02:29,508 --> 00:02:30,870
of what population model

86
00:02:30,877 --> 00:02:31,750
we have used.

87
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:32,676
The mean

88
00:02:32,683 --> 00:02:33,783
of this normal distribution

89
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:36,396
is given by the true parameter: θ.

90
00:02:36,643 --> 00:02:37,618
The variance is given

91
00:02:37,625 --> 00:02:40,977
by an explicit formula: σ^2(θ)/n.

92
00:02:42,483 --> 00:02:43,796
Given this, we can use

93
00:02:43,812 --> 00:02:45,375
our understanding of the quantiles

94
00:02:45,404 --> 00:02:46,867
of the normal distribution

95
00:02:46,885 --> 00:02:48,525
to figure our interval out.

96
00:02:48,873 --> 00:02:51,675
We know that for 95%

97
00:02:51,675 --> 00:02:53,469
of all possible samples,

98
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:56,263
θ^ would fall within a distance

99
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:58,468
of twice its standard deviation

100
00:02:58,496 --> 00:02:59,635
from its mean.

101
00:03:01,652 --> 00:03:02,459
But its mean

102
00:03:02,459 --> 00:03:04,346
is the true parameter θ,

103
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:06,724
and its standard deviation is known

104
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:10,061
to be σ(θ)/√n

105
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:14,462
In summary, we know that for 95%

106
00:03:14,474 --> 00:03:16,796
of all possible samples of size n,

107
00:03:16,808 --> 00:03:18,854
θ^ is going to be

108
00:03:18,854 --> 00:03:19,570
at a distance

109
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:23,794
 of no more than 2[σ(θ)/√n].

110
00:03:24,512 --> 00:03:25,884
Turning this on its head,

111
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,515
we can equivalently say

112
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:30,174
that for 95% of all possible samples

113
00:03:30,198 --> 00:03:31,156
of size n,

114
00:03:31,168 --> 00:03:33,378
the interval with left endpoint

115
00:03:33,438 --> 00:03:37,474
[θ^(x1,...,xn) - 2[σ(θ)/√n]]

116
00:03:37,486 --> 00:03:38,917
and right endpoint

117
00:03:38,929 --> 00:03:43,474
[θ^(x1,...,xn) + 2[σ(θ)/√n]]

118
00:03:43,476 --> 00:03:45,245
will contain θ.

119
00:03:45,257 --> 00:03:47,935
This is our confidence interval.

120
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:49,750
Notice that our formula

121
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:50,933
for the confidence interval

122
00:03:50,945 --> 00:03:52,212
can be written in the form

123
00:03:52,224 --> 00:03:54,857
of θ^±δ,

124
00:03:54,869 --> 00:03:56,037
which was precisely

125
00:03:56,049 --> 00:03:57,871
what we had set out to get.

126
00:03:58,612 --> 00:04:01,382
This δ depends on the unknown θ,

127
00:04:01,394 --> 00:04:02,707
but since we have

128
00:04:02,719 --> 00:04:04,845
an estimate θ^ of θ, 

129
00:04:04,973 --> 00:04:07,400
we can plug that in instead

130
00:04:07,412 --> 00:04:08,615
to get a formula

131
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:10,278
that we can calculate fully,

132
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,642
since it no longer depends

133
00:04:11,654 --> 00:04:12,499
on any unknowns.

134
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,963
This formula actually reveals

135
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:15,593
interesting

136
00:04:15,605 --> 00:04:16,858
structural characteristics.

137
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:19,075
For instance, we see that

138
00:04:19,087 --> 00:04:20,527
the interval is centered

139
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:21,708
at our estimate.

140
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,697
The length of the interval

141
00:04:23,709 --> 00:04:25,436
is inversely proportional

142
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:26,484
to the square root

143
00:04:26,496 --> 00:04:27,672
of the sample size,

144
00:04:27,797 --> 00:04:28,943
and this is something

145
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:29,906
we can control.

146
00:04:30,602 --> 00:04:31,867
For example, it tells us

147
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:32,746
that if we would like

148
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:33,726
to get an interval

149
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:35,877
that is of the same confidence level

150
00:04:35,889 --> 00:04:37,848
but is of half the length,

151
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,782
we need to collect a sample

152
00:04:39,794 --> 00:04:41,658
that is 4 times larger.

153
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,596
Finally, there is this factor of 2.

154
00:04:44,608 --> 00:04:45,936
This factor is related

155
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:47,043
to the confidence level,

156
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:49,403
which was 95% in our case.

157
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:52,061
Choosing a higher confidence level

158
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:54,206
will give a higher factor value,

159
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:56,225
whereas a lower confidence level

160
00:04:56,237 --> 00:04:58,222
will give a lower factor value.

161
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,720
For example, if we would like

162
00:05:00,732 --> 00:05:02,307
to build a confidence interval

163
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,554
with confidence 68%,

164
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:06,740
the factor actually becomes 1,

165
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:08,668
whereas for a confidence interval

166
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:10,253
of level 99%,

167
00:05:10,286 --> 00:05:11,932
the factor becomes 3.

168
00:05:11,944 --> 00:05:13,418
In other words,

169
00:05:13,430 --> 00:05:15,104
requiring higher confidence

170
00:05:15,116 --> 00:05:16,263
will also increase

171
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:17,570
the length of the interval.

172
00:05:17,582 --> 00:05:18,809
The extreme case

173
00:05:18,809 --> 00:05:21,136
of a 100% confidence interval

174
00:05:21,148 --> 00:05:23,225
would make the length infinite,

175
00:05:23,237 --> 00:05:24,587
and the interval would be

176
00:05:24,599 --> 00:05:25,576
uninformative.

177
00:05:25,576 --> 00:05:27,182
In any case,

178
00:05:27,194 --> 00:05:28,696
in most practical cases,

179
00:05:28,708 --> 00:05:29,920
one typically chooses

180
00:05:29,932 --> 00:05:32,381
95% confidence intervals.

181
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,802
To see a practical example,

182
00:05:34,814 --> 00:05:36,268
let's go back to the data set

183
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,702
on the weight

184
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:38,658
of 92 high school students

185
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:39,923
measured in pounds.

186
00:05:40,185 --> 00:05:41,609
Let's say we'd like to build

187
00:05:41,621 --> 00:05:43,685
a 95% confidence interval

188
00:05:43,697 --> 00:05:44,859
for the true mean weight

189
00:05:44,895 --> 00:05:46,225
of adolescents of that age.

190
00:05:46,724 --> 00:05:48,719
The population model that we assume

191
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:50,007
is a normal model

192
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:51,445
with mean parameter μ,

193
00:05:51,457 --> 00:05:53,300
representing the unknown mean weight

194
00:05:53,313 --> 00:05:54,974
at the level of population.

195
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,424
In this example,

196
00:05:56,449 --> 00:05:57,993
the maximum likelihood estimator

197
00:05:58,005 --> 00:05:59,400
of the true mean μ

198
00:05:59,412 --> 00:06:00,402
is given by

199
00:06:00,414 --> 00:06:07,030
μ^(x1,...,xn)=1/n(x1,...,xn)=x

200
00:06:07,042 --> 00:06:09,433
This is just the sample mean: x.

201
00:06:10,233 --> 00:06:11,601
So, the interval should be

202
00:06:11,613 --> 00:06:16,071
of the form: x±2[σ(x)/√n]

203
00:06:17,255 --> 00:06:18,909
Here, we can calculate

204
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:21,827
the sample mean to be 145,

205
00:06:21,871 --> 00:06:25,400
σ(x) to be 23.7,

206
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:28,331
and √n to be 9.6.

207
00:06:28,906 --> 00:06:30,303
Consequently,

208
00:06:30,315 --> 00:06:33,195
our 95% confidence interval for μ

209
00:06:33,207 --> 00:06:36,703
is [140 , 150].

210
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:39,448
We can draw this on the histogram

211
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,680
on the left.

212
00:06:42,217 --> 00:06:43,739
In many cases, we're actually

213
00:06:43,751 --> 00:06:45,257
particularly interested in having

214
00:06:45,257 --> 00:06:47,292
an upper bound or a lower bound

215
00:06:47,304 --> 00:06:48,743
for a parameter of interest.

216
00:06:48,755 --> 00:06:51,040
Of course, a confidence interval

217
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:52,326
automatically yields

218
00:06:52,338 --> 00:06:54,332
both an upper and a lower bound.

219
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:56,419
But, what if we only care

220
00:06:56,431 --> 00:06:57,508
about one of them?

221
00:06:58,446 --> 00:06:59,712
The idea is that by letting

222
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:01,301
one of the endpoints go,

223
00:07:01,313 --> 00:07:03,255
it will give us a sharper bound

224
00:07:03,267 --> 00:07:04,634
on the other endpoint.

225
00:07:04,884 --> 00:07:06,718
We can follow the exact same steps

226
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:07,723
as before, using

227
00:07:07,735 --> 00:07:08,792
the sampling distribution

228
00:07:08,804 --> 00:07:10,581
of a maximum likelihood estimator.

229
00:07:11,218 --> 00:07:12,465
These steps will give us

230
00:07:12,477 --> 00:07:14,486
a one-sided confidence interval,

231
00:07:14,498 --> 00:07:16,100
as shown on the right.

232
00:07:16,537 --> 00:07:18,106
Notice that the corresponding

233
00:07:18,118 --> 00:07:19,379
upper and lower bounds

234
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:20,652
have the same form

235
00:07:20,664 --> 00:07:22,571
in a two-sided confidence interval.

236
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:23,897
They are obtained

237
00:07:23,935 --> 00:07:25,547
by a small perturbation

238
00:07:25,559 --> 00:07:27,038
of the estimate to the right,

239
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,408
or to the left.

240
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,277
The difference is the scaling factor.

241
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:33,119
In the one-sided case,

242
00:07:33,131 --> 00:07:35,058
this is no longer equal to 2,

243
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:36,855
but has become 1.6.

244
00:07:36,867 --> 00:07:38,133
This tells us

245
00:07:38,145 --> 00:07:40,511
that if we only care about a bound,

246
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:41,668
we can typically get

247
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,127
more sharp intervals

248
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:45,386
with the same amount of confidence.

249
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:48,289
Let's now try to find an upper bound

250
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,434
for the true mean weight

251
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:50,820
in the high school example.

252
00:07:50,832 --> 00:07:52,461
Using our formulas,

253
00:07:52,473 --> 00:07:54,401
we know that the upper 95%

254
00:07:54,413 --> 00:07:56,064
confidence interval will have

255
00:07:56,076 --> 00:08:02,247
an upper bound of x+1.6[σ(x)/√n].

256
00:08:02,623 --> 00:08:04,646
Using our calculations from before,

257
00:08:04,658 --> 00:08:05,956
we find the result to give

258
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:09,808
a 95% upper bound of 149.

259
00:08:10,038 --> 00:08:12,567
In comparison, the two-sided interval

260
00:08:12,579 --> 00:08:13,805
would have given us an upper bound

261
00:08:13,817 --> 00:08:14,931
of 150,

262
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:16,533
which is more conservative

263
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,276
In summary, the two-sided interval

264
00:08:19,288 --> 00:08:20,382
gives us simultaneous

265
00:08:20,394 --> 00:08:21,531
upper and lower bounds,

266
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,650
but at the expense

267
00:08:22,662 --> 00:08:23,889
that neither of these bounds

268
00:08:23,889 --> 00:08:25,464
is as sharp as the corresponding

269
00:08:25,476 --> 00:08:28,176
95% one-sided intervals.

270
00:08:28,188 --> 00:08:29,537
The one-sided interval

271
00:08:29,549 --> 00:08:31,618
will give tighter, one-sided bounds,

272
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:32,661
but at the expense

273
00:08:32,671 --> 00:08:34,457
that it only gives us information

274
00:08:34,469 --> 00:08:35,595
on the one side,

275
00:08:35,607 --> 00:08:37,089
and is totally uninformative

276
00:08:37,101 --> 00:08:38,589
of the other side.
