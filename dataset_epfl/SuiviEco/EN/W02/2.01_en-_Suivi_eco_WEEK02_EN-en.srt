00:00:08,863 --> 00:00:11,863
Welcome to this model, on basic
concepts of Statistics.

2
00:00:12,248 --> 00:00:15,048
During the course of this model,
we will discuss the following topics.

3
00:00:15,464 --> 00:00:18,189
First we'll introduce a few general
notions on statistics,

4
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:21,389
about populations, samples,
variables, and distribution.

5
00:00:22,006 --> 00:00:24,656
We'll then see the summaries that
can be used in order to describe

6
00:00:24,843 --> 00:00:26,931
the distribution of
a statistical variable,

7
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:28,581
at the level of the sample.

8
00:00:29,429 --> 00:00:32,204
We will see that these can be
numerical, or graphical.

9
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:34,979
And we will investigate 
the key properties, strengths,

10
00:00:35,179 --> 00:00:38,004
and weaknesses of some 
such summaries.

11
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:41,647
Then, we'll talk of the means
of describing the distribution

12
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:44,847
at the level of population.
Particularly using what is called

13
00:00:45,047 --> 00:00:46,659
the Statistical Model.

14
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:49,151
We will see that 
such a statistical model,

15
00:00:49,351 --> 00:00:52,888
offers a parsimonious representation
of the distribution at the population level

16
00:00:53,212 --> 00:00:55,400
by means of a few
interpretable parameters.

17
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,537
This might have otherwise needed
many different numerical summaries

18
00:00:58,737 --> 00:01:00,074
to describe.

19
00:01:00,457 --> 00:01:03,345
We will review some 
important classes of such models.

20
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:07,548
We'll also see the relationship
between the sample distribution,

21
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:09,986
and the population
distribution model.

22
00:01:10,901 --> 00:01:13,026
How can we calibrate 
the population model

23
00:01:13,226 --> 00:01:16,638
in order to fit the observed 
distribution at the level of sample

24
00:01:16,838 --> 00:01:18,001
as best as possible.

25
00:01:18,201 --> 00:01:21,201
This is a so called problem
of point estimation.

26
00:01:21,575 --> 00:01:25,175
Where we seek to estimate the value
of the population parameters

27
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:28,751
using the sample at hand
as precisely as possible.

28
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:34,684
We'll discuss the quantification of 
the uncertainty inherent in our estimates.

29
00:01:34,966 --> 00:01:38,091
The issue is that the estimate
produced on the basis of our sample

30
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:40,129
will never be perfectly accurate.

31
00:01:40,582 --> 00:01:43,545
How can we quantify the uncertainty
in this estimate?

32
00:01:43,745 --> 00:01:46,820
How can we construct
a range of plausible values

33
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,420
for the population parameter with
the prescribed degree of confidence?

34
00:01:51,562 --> 00:01:54,487
Finally, we'll see the contrasting
of hypothesis

35
00:01:54,687 --> 00:01:57,687
that we may have formulated
before collecting our data

36
00:01:58,248 --> 00:02:00,123
with the data at hand.

37
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:03,377
How can we declare whether
or not a scientific hypothesis

38
00:02:03,577 --> 00:02:06,702
or conjecture is compatible, 
or not with the data?

39
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:10,391
How can we do so well guaranteeing
a certain level of protection

40
00:02:10,706 --> 00:02:14,181
from making wrong decisions
due to the sampling uncertainty?

41
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:18,898
How can we quantify the statistical
significance of an observed trend

42
00:02:19,098 --> 00:02:20,586
at the level of the sample?

43
00:02:21,132 --> 00:02:23,457
In all cases, we will
try to place emphasis

44
00:02:23,657 --> 00:02:26,657
on broad concepts, rather than
on specific techniques

45
00:02:26,857 --> 00:02:28,232
or technical details.

46
00:02:28,602 --> 00:02:30,252
Here we go.
