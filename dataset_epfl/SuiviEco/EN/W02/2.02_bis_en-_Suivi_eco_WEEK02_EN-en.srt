1
00:00:09,452 --> 00:00:12,990
Let's review the concepts introduced
in this unit.

2
00:00:13,593 --> 00:00:18,005
The population, this refers to all
the elephants of a park.

3
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:19,318
For example,

4
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:22,943
it could be a few (INAUDIBLE) of
elephants in the W Park

5
00:00:23,143 --> 00:00:24,943
in Burkina, Niger and Benin.

6
00:00:25,143 --> 00:00:27,831
Or lots more in Hwange National Park

7
00:00:28,031 --> 00:00:29,268
in Zimbabwe.

8
00:00:29,937 --> 00:00:33,987
The Statistical variable is what
we call the key ecological attribute

9
00:00:34,187 --> 00:00:36,812
or the indicator that 
we want to measure

10
00:00:37,024 --> 00:00:39,949
to assess the state of 
the monitored value.

11
00:00:40,508 --> 00:00:42,908
The variable can be qualitative,

12
00:00:43,108 --> 00:00:45,883
like elephant's color for example.

13
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:49,014
And the variable can also
be quantitative.

14
00:00:49,214 --> 00:00:52,651
For instance, measuring the age
of the elephants

15
00:00:53,044 --> 00:00:56,157
will help us know if the population
is in good shape.

16
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:58,869
In other words, 
if the part of young,

17
00:00:59,069 --> 00:01:02,419
adults, and old elephants
within the population

18
00:01:02,619 --> 00:01:04,644
is normal, and this would mean

19
00:01:04,844 --> 00:01:06,669
there is no poaching going on.

20
00:01:07,284 --> 00:01:10,359
This age group parts
we are talking about

21
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:13,396
are the distribution of
the age variable

22
00:01:13,596 --> 00:01:15,771
at the scale of the population.

23
00:01:16,455 --> 00:01:19,993
But obviously we can't measure
the age of all the elephants

24
00:01:20,355 --> 00:01:22,193
in Hwange National Park.

25
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:24,707
Therefore we will randomly select

26
00:01:24,907 --> 00:01:27,907
some elephants, and determine
their ages.

27
00:01:28,414 --> 00:01:30,264
This is the sample.

28
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:34,465
After having identified the ages
within the sample,

29
00:01:34,929 --> 00:01:38,604
we can estimate the age of 
the entire elephant population.

30
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:41,877
And now, what the degree
of confidence

31
00:01:42,077 --> 00:01:44,615
associated with this estimate is.

32
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,125
Age is a discreet variable.

33
00:01:47,325 --> 00:01:51,438
Meaning it can take any value
related to a certain number of years

34
00:01:51,884 --> 00:01:55,372
between the ages of the youngest
and the oldest elephants

35
00:01:55,572 --> 00:01:56,872
in the park.

36
00:01:57,216 --> 00:02:00,653
To simplify this, it is also 
possible to sort elephants

37
00:02:00,853 --> 00:02:02,378
per age groups.

38
00:02:02,578 --> 00:02:04,991
Young, adult and old.

39
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:07,893
This way, the age variable
is converted

40
00:02:08,093 --> 00:02:10,556
into a qualitative variable.

41
00:02:10,955 --> 00:02:13,655
But can we be sure that the variable
at the level of the sample

42
00:02:13,855 --> 00:02:16,142
is a good image of 
the total population?

43
00:02:16,517 --> 00:02:19,630
We will see this in Unit 2.7.
