1
00:00:09,671 --> 00:00:12,221
Further to numerical summaries,
one can also create 

2
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:14,625
graphical summaries of the sample. 

3
00:00:14,869 --> 00:00:18,582
This can often be more telling, 
as long as they are not abused. 

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:22,040
The qualitative variables,
one often uses pie charts 

5
00:00:22,246 --> 00:00:23,809
and bar charts. 

6
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:27,072
The qualitative variables, 
there is a much wider graphics 

7
00:00:27,339 --> 00:00:29,039
that one can consider.

8
00:00:29,268 --> 00:00:32,055
We will focus on two particular
type of graphics;

9
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:34,606
histograms and boxplots. 

10
00:00:34,807 --> 00:00:37,169
Pie charts and bar charts 
essentially carry

11
00:00:37,405 --> 00:00:40,730
the same information 
as a frequency table does

12
00:00:40,939 --> 00:00:42,715
but they're conveyed 
on a visual way 

13
00:00:42,943 --> 00:00:44,818
that is easier to appreciate. 

14
00:00:45,009 --> 00:00:48,334
Let's consider again the sample 
of 25 individuals

15
00:00:48,513 --> 00:00:51,126
where the variables of interest 
is their blood type. 

16
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:54,851
The sample is summarized 
in the frequency table on the left.

17
00:00:55,968 --> 00:01:00,281
The pie chart partitions the 
surface of the disk into sectors.

18
00:01:00,502 --> 00:01:03,104
Each sector corresponds 
to one of the categories 

19
00:01:03,326 --> 00:01:04,925
of the qualitative variable. 

20
00:01:05,586 --> 00:01:09,786
Here, we have sector A 
corresponding to the value A. 

21
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:12,916
Sector B corresponding 
to the value B, 

22
00:01:13,134 --> 00:01:15,133
and so on and so forth.

23
00:01:15,349 --> 00:01:18,162
Assuming that the 
total area of the disk

24
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:21,506
corresponds to one 100%,

25
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,289
the sectors are drawn 
in such a way 

26
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:28,122
so that the area of each sector
corresponds to the percentage 

27
00:01:28,336 --> 00:01:31,349
of the corresponding category 
in the frequency table. 

28
00:01:31,588 --> 00:01:35,063
So for instance,
the area of sector B over here

29
00:01:35,275 --> 00:01:40,600
should be equal 32% relative 
to the total of 100%

30
00:01:41,429 --> 00:01:45,279
A bar chart draws a separate bar
for each category of a variable

31
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:47,423
arranged side by side.

32
00:01:47,654 --> 00:01:50,879
A, B, O, and AB, 

33
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,612
in the case 
of the blood group example.

34
00:01:53,826 --> 00:01:57,225
Each bar is designed 
so that it's area 

35
00:01:57,454 --> 00:02:00,903
is proportional to the corresponding
relative frequency 

36
00:02:01,113 --> 00:02:04,876
or equivalently to the corresponding
 absolute frequency.

37
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:07,801
In essence, pie charts 
and bar charts provide 

38
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,866
the exact same information. 

39
00:02:10,074 --> 00:02:12,835
Their difference is merely 
a question of style.

40
00:02:13,515 --> 00:02:15,727
when dealing with
 a quantitative variable, 

41
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,960
we see graphical summaries 
that allow us to easily visualize 

42
00:02:19,201 --> 00:02:22,551
the concentration of sample values 
in different regions of the axis.

43
00:02:22,774 --> 00:02:25,186
A basic such graphic 
is the histogram

44
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:28,024
which is based on an idea
that is not too dissimilar

45
00:02:28,215 --> 00:02:29,790
to the bar chart. 

46
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:33,408
It's aim is to help us visualize 
what proportion software contained 

47
00:02:33,711 --> 00:02:36,211
in different sub-regions 
of the axis. 

48
00:02:36,412 --> 00:02:38,000
Let's consider an example
to see 

49
00:02:38,209 --> 00:02:40,197
how an histogram is constructed.

50
00:02:40,419 --> 00:02:42,545
The data set on the right 
shows the weight 

51
00:02:42,741 --> 00:02:46,941
of 92  high school seniors 
divided between boys and girls

52
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:48,842
and is measured pounds. 

53
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:51,260
To construct a histogram 
for this data set,

54
00:02:51,442 --> 00:02:53,392
we first divide the range 
of the data 

55
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:56,403
into non-overlapping intervals 
of equal length. 

56
00:02:56,605 --> 00:02:58,768
And this example, 
which is nine intervals,

57
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:01,834
then we count proportionate 
sample observations 

58
00:03:02,017 --> 00:03:05,029
contained in each interval
and draw a horizontal line 

59
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,927
over that interval
at a height that is equal 

60
00:03:08,114 --> 00:03:09,626
to that proportion.

61
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:12,596
Thus, the height of each 
resulting bin

62
00:03:12,789 --> 00:03:15,014
informs us of proportions 
of observations 

63
00:03:15,213 --> 00:03:17,526
in that corresponding interval.

64
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:21,019
The histogram allows us to very
directly appreciate the location, 

65
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:23,297
scatter, and 
symmetry or asymmetry 

66
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:26,112
of the sample distribution, 
all at the same time. 

67
00:03:26,542 --> 00:03:30,379
The main weakness of histogram 
is there is no objective choice 

68
00:03:30,577 --> 00:03:32,602
of how many intervals 
or bins

69
00:03:32,782 --> 00:03:34,807
 once you divide the range 
into.

70
00:03:35,002 --> 00:03:37,628
A very small number of wide things
gives information 

71
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:41,611
that is too coarse, 
as it flushes out finer information.

72
00:03:41,823 --> 00:03:45,223
A very large narrow bins 
is not helpful either,

73
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:48,143
It obscures the general form 
by giving information

74
00:03:48,367 --> 00:03:49,480
 that is too fine.

75
00:03:49,682 --> 00:03:52,682
The choice of the number of bins
should be made judiciously

76
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:55,541
depending on the number 
of observations.

77
00:03:55,749 --> 00:03:59,049
The general rule is that the larger
the sample size n,

78
00:03:59,289 --> 00:04:02,027
the more the bins 
one should consider. 

79
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,054
Luckily, computer software 
automatically selects 

80
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:08,448
reasonable choice 
but a good analyst must always 

81
00:04:08,696 --> 00:04:11,933
keep in mind to not 
over interpret characteristics 

82
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:14,927
visible in the histogram 
as these may depend 

83
00:04:15,154 --> 00:04:18,192
on the arbitrary choice 
of number of bins. 

84
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:22,609
To see the impact of the choice 
of number of bins

85
00:04:22,816 --> 00:04:26,166
on the form of the histogram, 
let's compare the histogram we get

86
00:04:26,369 --> 00:04:29,031
from the previous
data set for two different values 

87
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:31,084
of bin width. 

88
00:04:31,308 --> 00:04:33,521
On the left, we have the original
bin width

89
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:37,173
with a range of the data
being partitioned into 9 intervals. 

90
00:04:37,424 --> 00:04:41,637
On the right, the range of the data 
is partitioned into 13 intervals.

91
00:04:41,862 --> 00:04:45,724
This results into coarser bins
on the left 

92
00:04:45,905 --> 00:04:49,942
and finer bins on the right. 

93
00:04:50,136 --> 00:04:53,799
Now while the overall shape
of the two histograms is the same.

94
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:57,256
we can see the two histograms
present some subtle differences.

95
00:04:57,935 --> 00:05:01,560
Since these differences are related
to the choice of number of classes,

96
00:05:01,747 --> 00:05:04,860
we should not put too much emphasis 
on these when interpreting 

97
00:05:05,051 --> 00:05:06,776
the histogram. 

98
00:05:06,976 --> 00:05:10,501
The different means of visualizing 
the distribution of the sample

99
00:05:10,692 --> 00:05:12,517
is the boxplot. 

100
00:05:12,719 --> 00:05:16,144
Contrary to the histogram, 
it has tuning parameters  to choose,

101
00:05:16,426 --> 00:05:19,988
and so it can be objectively
constructed for any data set.

102
00:05:20,226 --> 00:05:23,251
Now on the other hand, 
it is a closer  representation

103
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,757
of the data set. 

104
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,093
How does it work?

105
00:05:26,286 --> 00:05:28,561
Let's use the high school student
data set again  

106
00:05:28,838 --> 00:05:30,551
to demonstrate how exactly. 

107
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,209
The first step is to arrange 
the order statistics 

108
00:05:33,422 --> 00:05:35,872
of the sample on an axis. 

109
00:05:36,125 --> 00:05:38,150
This goes from the 
smallest observation

110
00:05:38,351 --> 00:05:41,351
to the largest observation 
in increasing order. 

111
00:05:41,618 --> 00:05:44,555
Then, boxplot is basically 
an annotation

112
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:47,316
of some key numerical summaries. 

113
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:49,833
We annotate the location 
of the median, 

114
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:53,015
as well as the location of the first
and third quartile. 

115
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:58,477
This is done by using a box
that hovers over the axis.

116
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,205
The end-points of the box 
correspond to the location 

117
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:03,058
of the second and third quartiles,

118
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:06,479
while the line down the middle 
is the location of the median. 

119
00:06:07,471 --> 00:06:10,484
Then, we annotate the smallest

120
00:06:10,715 --> 00:06:13,277
and the largest observations 
to fall within

121
00:06:13,452 --> 00:06:18,552
1.5 times the inter-quartile range
by vertical lines. 

122
00:06:18,809 --> 00:06:21,946
These vertical lines are 
called whiskers. 

123
00:06:23,178 --> 00:06:27,277
Any observations falling outside 
the whiskers are called outliers

124
00:06:27,485 --> 00:06:29,685
and are annotated individually. 

125
00:06:30,524 --> 00:06:32,861
In this data set, 
the largest observation

126
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:36,233
that corresponds to 220 pounds 
lies way 

127
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:38,287
beyond the right whisker. 

128
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:41,595
This is why it's annotated 
separately by a dot. 

129
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:43,695
A boxplot will allow us 
to appreciate 

130
00:06:43,918 --> 00:06:46,818
some of the basic characteristics 
of a distribution. 

131
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:49,581
The middle line in the box 
represents the medium. 

132
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:52,138
So about half the south of values 
are to the left

133
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:54,132
 and half to the right
of that line. 

134
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:58,240
This gives an indication 
of the location sample distribution.

135
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:02,009
The lines representing the quartiles
give us a division of the sample

136
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,626
into quarters.

137
00:07:03,845 --> 00:07:06,532
These can be used to gauge 
the dispersion of the sample

138
00:07:06,725 --> 00:07:09,099
as well as the symmetry 
or lack of it 

139
00:07:09,355 --> 00:07:11,418
at the level of sample distribution.

140
00:07:11,652 --> 00:07:13,490
When the overall shape 
of the boxplot

141
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,325
is symmetric around the median, 

142
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:18,270
we have  a roughly 
symmetric distribution. 

143
00:07:18,486 --> 00:07:21,761
Such is the case 
in the first boxplot on the right.

144
00:07:22,422 --> 00:07:25,835
Otherwise, if one side 
of the boxplot is elongated 

145
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:29,344
related to the other, 
then we speak of skewed distribution

146
00:07:29,575 --> 00:07:32,162
to the left or to the right 
depending on which side 

147
00:07:32,347 --> 00:07:34,372
of the medium the elongation 
appears in. 

148
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:36,949
The second boxplot 
on the right picks a sample 

149
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:39,273
that is skewed to the right.

150
00:07:39,482 --> 00:07:41,545
The whiskers now 
is supposed to indicate

151
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:43,510
where the bulk of the sample lies. 

152
00:07:43,708 --> 00:07:46,070
When observations fall outside 
of the whiskers,

153
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:48,362
these observations are 
called outliners

154
00:07:48,567 --> 00:07:52,005
because they lie outside 
the main crowd of points. 

155
00:07:52,227 --> 00:07:55,852
The third boxplot on the right
features five such outliers.

156
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:58,791
Outliers deserve further scrutiny
and should not just  

157
00:07:58,997 --> 00:08:00,472
be treated as average. 

158
00:08:00,684 --> 00:08:02,172
They may indicate for example

159
00:08:02,382 --> 00:08:04,795
if there is an interesting 
phenomenon going on

160
00:08:04,982 --> 00:08:08,269
or that the distribution under study
has what we call heavy tails. 

161
00:08:08,472 --> 00:08:10,596
This means that the population 
under study

162
00:08:10,812 --> 00:08:13,837
has a non-trivial proportion 
of individuals whose variables

163
00:08:14,038 --> 00:08:16,226
takes on very different values 
than the rest. 

164
00:08:16,406 --> 00:08:19,456
Still, it is a possibility 
that the outliers are due 

165
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:21,628
to data registration error. 

166
00:08:21,811 --> 00:08:25,073
We can't know that 
and we must scrutinize more.

167
00:08:25,318 --> 00:08:28,518
Boxplots are particularly useful
for comparing distributions 

168
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,330
of different samples 
by displaying them side by side

169
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:33,526
as is done in the right here. 

170
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:36,513
For instance, we can construct 
two separate boxplots

171
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:38,924
for the boys and the girls
in the sample

172
00:08:39,155 --> 00:08:41,342
 of 92 high school students. 

173
00:08:41,585 --> 00:08:43,873
This boxplot corresponds 
to the girls 

174
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:47,199
and this boxplot corresponds 
to the boys.

175
00:08:47,421 --> 00:08:50,721
By comparing them side by side, 
we can see that both samples 

176
00:08:50,992 --> 00:08:53,980
have roughly symmetric distributions
or perhaps 

177
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:58,182
the sample of the boys appears to be
slightly skewed to the right. 

178
00:08:59,428 --> 00:09:03,341
It is clear that the location
of the sample of boys 

179
00:09:03,569 --> 00:09:06,957
is further up than the location 
of the samples of girls. 

180
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,978
Boys typically weigh more. 

181
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,500
It also as though the sample 
of errors is more concentrated 

182
00:09:13,754 --> 00:09:17,905
around the median as is indicated
by the inter-quartile range.

183
00:09:19,489 --> 00:09:22,465
The histogram in the boxplot
are useful means to summarize 

184
00:09:22,646 --> 00:09:24,846
the sample distribution
in a visual way.  

185
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,482
The histogram gives finer 
representation 

186
00:09:27,684 --> 00:09:28,946
of the data distribution. 

187
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:31,776
The height of each rectangle
gives us the proportion

188
00:09:32,009 --> 00:09:35,247
of sample observation falling
into that corresponding interval. 

189
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,662
However, it's interpretation 
is susceptible to change 

190
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,972
depending on the choice 
of bin width

191
00:09:41,182 --> 00:09:42,882
 which must be made judiciously.

192
00:09:43,078 --> 00:09:45,928
In particular, one should not 
over-interpret fine details 

193
00:09:46,137 --> 00:09:48,350
of a histogram 
which are typically unstable

194
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:50,578
to perturbation of the bin width. 

195
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:54,233
We should not try to extract 
more information from this graphic

196
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:56,775
than what it can actually offer. 

197
00:09:56,971 --> 00:09:59,871
The boxplot is not as finer 
representation of the data,

198
00:10:00,138 --> 00:10:04,013
but has the advantage of not 
depending on junior parameters.

199
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,862
Since it does not depend 
on such junior parameters 

200
00:10:07,155 --> 00:10:11,006
it allows to very easily compare
between different sums. 

201
00:10:11,253 --> 00:10:14,240
Finally a warning, when accessing
the graphical summary 

202
00:10:14,425 --> 00:10:18,012
of a sample, it's important to not
over-interpret delicate features 

203
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,320
and details.

204
00:10:19,553 --> 00:10:21,866
It's important to remember 
that minor features 

205
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:25,185
are subject to a random fluctuations
that could be due 

206
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:26,956
to the random sampling. 

207
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:30,821
They may not persist in new
or different samples. 

208
00:10:31,046 --> 00:10:33,934
The human mind has a tendency
to try and discover patterns 

209
00:10:34,148 --> 00:10:37,398
everywhere, even when 
these patterns don't exist. 

210
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:41,381
Assessing data should be immune
to such magical thinking.
