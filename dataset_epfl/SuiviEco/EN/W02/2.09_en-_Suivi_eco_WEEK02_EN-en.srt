1
00:00:08,848 --> 00:00:11,948
The Jolly method
is mentioned several times

2
00:00:12,171 --> 00:00:14,783
in the book hence this
additional unit

3
00:00:15,011 --> 00:00:17,323
that briefly
introduces it.

4
00:00:17,575 --> 00:00:20,513
It is particularly useful
when it comes to analyzing

5
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:23,909
data from aerial surveys
and we will take

6
00:00:24,142 --> 00:00:26,517
the following example to
provide details

7
00:00:26,746 --> 00:00:29,796
on the Jolly 1
calculation method.

8
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:35,781
Let's consider a
1000km2 park.

9
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:41,723
We want to sample at random
30 20km long transects

10
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:45,944
by 500m wide.
In other words,

11
00:00:46,145 --> 00:00:51,708
a 250m stripe on each
side of the plain.

12
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:58,304
Each transect covers
a 10km2 surface.

13
00:00:58,526 --> 00:01:01,651
In the park are
the total of 100 of them

14
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:06,366
theoretically to cover
it's entire surface.

15
00:01:06,687 --> 00:01:09,650
The following table gives the
number of elephants counted

16
00:01:09,859 --> 00:01:14,259
on each transect,
491 in total.

17
00:01:15,004 --> 00:01:18,529
The mean of the samples
is the sum of elephants per sample

18
00:01:18,749 --> 00:01:25,062
divided by n and that is
16.4 elephants per transect.

19
00:01:25,467 --> 00:01:29,642
The total population is
100 times this mean.

20
00:01:29,873 --> 00:01:33,948
There are 100 possible samples
in the park so we are

21
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:40,663
1640 elephants in total.
The sample variance calculated

22
00:01:40,867 --> 00:01:46,892
following the usual method is
144.9 and the population variation

23
00:01:47,115 --> 00:01:54,415
is deduced by the formula here
so a total of 33 810.

24
00:01:54,636 --> 00:02:00,286
Hence the almost 184 standard
deviation for the population.

25
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:04,975
Now, we can calculate the 
confidence interval around the mean

26
00:02:05,195 --> 00:02:10,920
and that is 1.96 times
standard deviation

27
00:02:11,205 --> 00:02:15,292
meaning 360.
The Jolly 2 method

28
00:02:15,544 --> 00:02:18,681
uses the same principles
but deals with sampling

29
00:02:18,907 --> 00:02:21,669
where the transect land
are viable.

30
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,077
This adds viability within
the transects to the viability

31
00:02:25,304 --> 00:02:28,304
that already exists between
the transects.
