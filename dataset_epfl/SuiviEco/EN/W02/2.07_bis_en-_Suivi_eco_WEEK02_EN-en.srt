1
00:00:09,448 --> 00:00:12,485
Let's get back to our
elephant population.

2
00:00:13,003 --> 00:00:14,590
We want to know it's age,

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:17,693
which is the ecological attribute
we want to measure.

4
00:00:17,904 --> 00:00:21,179
Therefore, we will be working
on the sample.

5
00:00:21,963 --> 00:00:26,500
We measure the age
of all 13 elephants in the sample.

6
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:30,717
This way, we will easily obtain
an estimate of the samples

7
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:32,470
average age,

8
00:00:32,886 --> 00:00:35,449
and a standard deviation
that will give information

9
00:00:35,688 --> 00:00:38,713
on the confidence we can have
in this estimate.

10
00:00:38,988 --> 00:00:42,376
Then, we determine a range
of values in which there is

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:48,103
95% chance to obtain
the average age of the elephants,

12
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:51,484
which we call
The Confidence Intervals.

13
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:55,526
In the sample, where
the mean is 19.3

14
00:00:55,864 --> 00:00:57,914
and the standard deviation is 16,

15
00:00:58,252 --> 00:01:01,827
all the possible values of the mean
are from between more or less

16
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:06,263
2 times the standard deviation
divided by the root of 30.

17
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,610
Here we can see that
this value is quite high,

18
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:12,505
and not that useful.

19
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:16,601
This is related to the fact
that the sample is very small.

20
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:20,336
If the size of the sample increases,

21
00:01:20,561 --> 00:01:22,661
the confidence intervals decreases

22
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:25,867
as this interval is
inversely proportionate

23
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:28,175
to the square root
of the sample size.

24
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:33,325
Thus, if we take 4 times as many
elephants from the sample,

25
00:01:33,562 --> 00:01:36,275
the length of the confidence
interval will be divided

26
00:01:36,507 --> 00:01:37,882
at least in half.

27
00:01:38,686 --> 00:01:42,886
To do this, let's take a sample
with 4 times as many individuals.

28
00:01:43,672 --> 00:01:48,484
The group is now made of
52 elephants instead of 13,

29
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,458
and it's mean is still 19.3 years.

30
00:01:53,862 --> 00:01:59,162
But now, deviance is 159,
and the standard deviation is 12.

31
00:01:59,797 --> 00:02:02,422
So, the confidence interval
decreases.

32
00:02:03,284 --> 00:02:05,522
The estimate gets more precise.
