1
00:00:08,978 --> 00:00:11,891
Monitoring plants 
that are considered 

2
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,305
as protected area values
if often key 

3
00:00:15,539 --> 00:00:19,552
to understanding the ecosystem
and making the right decision 

4
00:00:19,816 --> 00:00:23,790
especially when it comes to ensuring
a sustainable development 

5
00:00:23,988 --> 00:00:26,013
of certain woody plants. 

6
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:30,590
If the goal is to monitor
long-term changes 

7
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:33,714
of plants biodiversity 
in different ecosystem, 

8
00:00:33,943 --> 00:00:39,868
it is key to use samples 
in permanently marked-off areas.

9
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,617
The intensity ecological factors 
can change 

10
00:00:43,841 --> 00:00:47,641
based on geological 
or topographic gradients 

11
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,764
which then causes changes 
in the structure 

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:55,410
and in the floristic composition 
along these gradients. 

13
00:00:56,593 --> 00:00:59,706
Regarding the monitoring 
of plants communities 

14
00:00:59,932 --> 00:01:03,257
that do not have strong gradients,
it is recommended 

15
00:01:03,453 --> 00:01:08,015
to use permanent plots, 
but when the gradients are strong,

16
00:01:08,236 --> 00:01:11,648
it is better to use 
permanent transects. 

17
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:14,658
We won't be developing 
these specifications here 

18
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:19,407
as this unit focuses on monitoring 
trees of a forest canopy 

19
00:01:19,623 --> 00:01:23,886
in stands where there are 
no strong gradients. 

20
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:30,103
Monitoring trees of a permanent 
forest plots in the long run, 

21
00:01:30,316 --> 00:01:34,053
provides important information 
on the forest structure 

22
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:38,065
and composition, 
on it's condition, 

23
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:41,677
the growth pace and longevity
of trees species 

24
00:01:41,902 --> 00:01:43,439
inside the forest,

25
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:47,050
on the progressive variation 
of a species' composition

26
00:01:47,256 --> 00:01:49,568
and the size of the population,

27
00:01:49,784 --> 00:01:52,534
on the impacts 
environmental changes

28
00:01:52,754 --> 00:01:55,767
have on the mature trees, 
et cetera. 

29
00:01:56,694 --> 00:02:01,657
This continuous form of monitoring, 
help to assess the impacts

30
00:02:01,892 --> 00:02:05,879
of the decisions 
affecting forest vegetation. 

31
00:02:06,086 --> 00:02:09,673
In this case, permanent plots 
can ground-truth 

32
00:02:09,872 --> 00:02:13,997
the measurements obtained 
via satellite images.  

33
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:19,013
Square shaped plots 
are generally the norm. 

34
00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:25,752
In the case of forest ecosystems, 
two sizes of square-shaped plots

35
00:02:25,965 --> 00:02:29,402
are recommended,
100 by 100 meters,

36
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:32,652
one hectare or 2.5 acres 

37
00:02:32,876 --> 00:02:35,038
and 20 by 20 meter plots. 

38
00:02:35,225 --> 00:02:38,638
These two formats 
are interchangeable 

39
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:41,055
or can be used together.

40
00:02:41,764 --> 00:02:47,564
Ideally, you should be able to use
at least two plots of 2.5 acres 

41
00:02:47,765 --> 00:02:50,652
per selected type of forest 
or stand

42
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:54,900
and whatever the stand, 
use at least 5 independent quadrants

43
00:02:55,141 --> 00:02:57,353
of 20 by 20 meters. 

44
00:02:57,576 --> 00:03:00,626
Plotting the species 
accumulation curve determines

45
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:05,220
if this number is sufficient 
for the given forest stand. 

46
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,173
To avoid bias, the plots should be
scattered randomly 

47
00:03:10,363 --> 00:03:12,575
throughout the chosen stands.

48
00:03:12,824 --> 00:03:15,886
Likewise, the location of the plot
in each settlement 

49
00:03:16,098 --> 00:03:18,761
should be set at random. 

50
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:23,571
Some basic principles 
ought to be followed. 

51
00:03:23,807 --> 00:03:28,845
A, the equivalent 3 times edge 
of the forest covers

52
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:33,141
should separate the plot 
from the edge of a non-forest stand

53
00:03:33,392 --> 00:03:35,680
to prevent an edge effect.

54
00:03:35,915 --> 00:03:40,477
B, plots of 2.5 acres 
should be separated 

55
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:43,466
by at least 250 meters 

56
00:03:43,717 --> 00:03:48,342
and 20 by 20 meter quadrats 
by at least 50 meters. 

57
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:52,085
See, in small or un-even
forest stands 

58
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:57,033
where the previously stated 
conditions can not be respected,

59
00:03:57,250 --> 00:04:00,563
only independent 
20 by  20 meter quadrats

60
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:05,362
and not 1 hector plots 
should be established. 

61
00:04:05,565 --> 00:04:10,277
D, avoid establishing plots 
where there are strong 

62
00:04:10,469 --> 00:04:15,044
and an unusual plant variations
or in the presence 

63
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:20,141
of important ecological disruptions
such as a small lake, 

64
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:22,709
a field or a river, 

65
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,457
and E, avoid places where 
roads or paths 

66
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:31,721
run for the plots
unless the study is about 

67
00:04:31,961 --> 00:04:36,424
the impact the use 
of such paths. 

68
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:40,156
In this case, the decisions 
should be justified. 

69
00:04:41,028 --> 00:04:44,915
It is vital to collect and take note
on the following data.

70
00:04:45,977 --> 00:04:50,127
The tag number and species 
of all standing trees

71
00:04:50,335 --> 00:04:54,435
with a diameter at breast height, 
DBH, equal to 

72
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,702
or higher than 10 centimeters, 
4 centimeter, or higher, 

73
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:02,521
when forest growth 
is poor.

74
00:05:02,744 --> 00:05:08,082
Two, the location all numbered trees
of course, located on a map. 

75
00:05:08,312 --> 00:05:12,637
The DBH of all numbered trees, 
the DBH measurements 

76
00:05:12,856 --> 00:05:17,443
following strict rules 
as just showed on this diagram. 

77
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:22,279
The general state 
of all numbered trees.

78
00:05:23,135 --> 00:05:26,948
The following data should also be 
collected and recorded. 

79
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:29,841
The height of all numbered trees, 

80
00:05:30,054 --> 00:05:32,392
the height of the lowest 
leaving branch

81
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,708
of all numbered trees. 

82
00:05:34,918 --> 00:05:40,081
The canopy age, photos taken
from given places 

83
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:42,364
at set times and dates. 

84
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:46,937
The degree of canopy closure
per quadrat. 

85
00:05:47,793 --> 00:05:51,768
The forest stand should be assessed 
every five years 

86
00:05:51,985 --> 00:05:54,360
or whenever needed. 

87
00:05:54,598 --> 00:05:58,648
If the quadrats suffer 
from terrible weather conditions, 

88
00:05:58,878 --> 00:06:02,303
fires or other catastrophic events,

89
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,572
the quadrats should be 
measured again, 

90
00:06:04,788 --> 00:06:09,275
and the new information 
should recorded as soon as possible

91
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:14,989
after the catastrophe
when the conditions  have improved.

92
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:21,458
To analyze the data, draw up list
of standing species 

93
00:06:21,705 --> 00:06:24,655
found for all selected trees,

94
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:28,299
take notes of all 
the species found in the plots 

95
00:06:28,523 --> 00:06:31,161
or in the permanent quadrats. 

96
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:35,835
For each species 
of living trees only,

97
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:39,711
calculate separately 
the abundance, 

98
00:06:39,913 --> 00:06:43,825
the basal area, 
the density and the dominance, 

99
00:06:44,054 --> 00:06:46,967
the frequency, 
the relative density, 

100
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,570
the relative dominance, 
the relative frequency 

101
00:06:50,778 --> 00:06:53,415
and the value of importance.

102
00:06:53,896 --> 00:06:56,671
Calculate the total basal surface 

103
00:06:56,899 --> 00:07:02,524
of all standing dead trees 
and the ones leaning. 

104
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:08,405
If carried out well 
on the representative samples

105
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:10,785
of a studied stand,

106
00:07:10,954 --> 00:07:13,729
 monitoring plants will help,

107
00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:16,379
making the right 
management decisions

108
00:07:16,556 --> 00:07:19,756
be there in terms
of forest conversation

109
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,185
or of it's sustainable use

110
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,983
when compatible 
with the protected area's

111
00:07:26,188 --> 00:07:28,813
 conservation targets.
