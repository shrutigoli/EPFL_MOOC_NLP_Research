1
00:00:09,159 --> 00:00:12,447
So monitoring mobile species

2
00:00:12,534 --> 00:00:15,671
requires the implementation

3
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:20,014
of suitable monitoring systems.

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:24,145
In Ecology,

5
00:00:24,364 --> 00:00:26,801
there are several ways

6
00:00:26,887 --> 00:00:31,312
of observing mobile animals

7
00:00:32,841 --> 00:00:36,017
and this can be done broadly

8
00:00:37,607 --> 00:00:39,607
or not depending

9
00:00:39,709 --> 00:00:43,059
on animals traveling distance.

10
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:47,205
When animals travel

11
00:00:47,252 --> 00:00:49,364
of a shorter distances

12
00:00:50,216 --> 00:00:52,592
big mammal ecologist

13
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:56,754
often use what is called

14
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,224
radio tracking.

15
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:01,605
This is a monitoring

16
00:01:01,709 --> 00:01:03,610
or detection system

17
00:01:03,942 --> 00:01:08,230
for animals previously fitted

18
00:01:08,315 --> 00:01:11,741
with a radio transmitter.

19
00:01:13,673 --> 00:01:17,237
The animals confirmations,

20
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:20,177
their environment

21
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:24,227
and ways of moving about

22
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,821
are considered

23
00:01:26,926 --> 00:01:29,652
when fitting the transmitter.

24
00:01:31,552 --> 00:01:35,028
In the case of large animals,

25
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:41,027
harnesses and collars are used

26
00:01:42,215 --> 00:01:46,290
and whenever the harness is too big

27
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:53,192
adhesive tapes or subcutaneous

28
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,275
or even surgical implants

29
00:01:57,894 --> 00:01:59,820
are preferred.

30
00:02:00,955 --> 00:02:02,393
You must remember

31
00:02:02,486 --> 00:02:08,337
not to either equip a small animal

32
00:02:08,501 --> 00:02:14,875
with transmitters that will exceed

33
00:02:15,501 --> 00:02:20,064
6% of their weight.

34
00:02:22,127 --> 00:02:24,052
Another technique

35
00:02:24,997 --> 00:02:27,122
for animals traveling

36
00:02:27,174 --> 00:02:29,824
over short distances

37
00:02:31,274 --> 00:02:35,311
provided they are easy to find again

38
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:40,730
with the bit to use bands

39
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:44,274
or colored marks.

40
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:48,678
This is obviously more convenient

41
00:02:48,739 --> 00:02:51,514
than radio transmitters.

42
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,445
The animal is equipped

43
00:02:54,504 --> 00:02:58,403
with a non-bird ring

44
00:02:59,245 --> 00:03:02,883
and a bright colored tag

45
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:07,082
or plate to facilitate

46
00:03:07,128 --> 00:03:09,315
each identification

47
00:03:09,396 --> 00:03:11,909
from a short distance.

48
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:14,959
This will help clearly

49
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:17,029
to recognize it

50
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:21,300
and in a group settings

51
00:03:21,767 --> 00:03:23,904
to monitor each movement

52
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:27,242
and behavior individually.

53
00:03:28,017 --> 00:03:30,379
Parts of their coat

54
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:32,417
 can also be blench

55
00:03:32,582 --> 00:03:35,782
to monitor individual animals

56
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:40,107
of a species on a territory.

57
00:03:40,476 --> 00:03:42,226
This is by the way

58
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:45,746
of them carried out on animals

59
00:03:45,891 --> 00:03:48,278
such as large birds

60
00:03:48,303 --> 00:03:53,615
of prey or wading birds.

61
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:58,242
And for animals traveling

62
00:03:58,306 --> 00:04:00,930
of a long distances

63
00:04:01,376 --> 00:04:04,964
ecologist essentially use

64
00:04:05,039 --> 00:04:10,014
GPS tags or ARGOS tags

65
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:14,027
which shows the animals location

66
00:04:14,377 --> 00:04:16,214
from a distance.

67
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:17,586
The GPS,

68
00:04:17,643 --> 00:04:20,692
this is global positioning systems.

69
00:04:21,312 --> 00:04:24,250
The GPS then has the benefit 

70
00:04:24,294 --> 00:04:27,482
of recording location

71
00:04:27,589 --> 00:04:29,501
with great precision

72
00:04:30,649 --> 00:04:34,499
of not having a range limit

73
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:37,372
and also it gives the possibility

74
00:04:37,428 --> 00:04:39,190
of choosing the time

75
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:44,042
and the frequency of data receptions.

76
00:04:45,852 --> 00:04:47,752
In the special case

77
00:04:47,816 --> 00:04:50,316
of migratory birds,

78
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:54,178
it isn't uncommon

79
00:04:54,363 --> 00:04:56,862
to band the animal

80
00:04:57,011 --> 00:04:59,474
to monitor movement 

81
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:02,514
but these requires 

82
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:05,264
using the capture.

83
00:05:05,366 --> 00:05:07,854
This is to put the band

84
00:05:08,344 --> 00:05:11,469
and recapture again the individual

85
00:05:11,623 --> 00:05:13,410
 to (INAUDIBLE) results.

86
00:05:13,865 --> 00:05:15,503
The only exception

87
00:05:15,675 --> 00:05:19,149
is when monitoring large species

88
00:05:20,028 --> 00:05:22,391
where it is possible

89
00:05:22,811 --> 00:05:25,998
to read the larger range

90
00:05:26,111 --> 00:05:27,998
from a distance.

91
00:05:29,334 --> 00:05:31,485
All the techniques

92
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:37,391
that uses tags and transmitters

93
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:41,206
help finding living animals

94
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:44,765
but also the carcasses

95
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:46,969
which is a very useful

96
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:49,747
when studying the causes

97
00:05:49,794 --> 00:05:53,206
of animalâ€™s death.

98
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:58,767
This is also a techniques

99
00:05:59,279 --> 00:06:01,654
that gives the possibility

100
00:06:01,721 --> 00:06:05,659
to obtain important information

101
00:06:05,701 --> 00:06:08,463
on territorial limits

102
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,269
and also interaction

103
00:06:11,343 --> 00:06:14,543
with different population.

104
00:06:15,573 --> 00:06:17,411
Also, it gives information

105
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:19,419
on breeding areas

106
00:06:19,522 --> 00:06:23,597
and rate and food intake

107
00:06:23,689 --> 00:06:25,939
breeding areas, rate, food intake

108
00:06:26,008 --> 00:06:28,170
and any other behavior.

109
00:06:30,076 --> 00:06:31,839
They are therefore 

110
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,959
excellent techniques

111
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,516
that will complete

112
00:06:36,608 --> 00:06:38,021
which is complementing

113
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,833
other direct monitoring techniques

114
00:06:40,891 --> 00:06:43,804
that we have talked about earlier.

115
00:06:44,756 --> 00:06:50,644
Even though they resemble a research

116
00:06:50,747 --> 00:06:52,197
more than strictly 

117
00:06:52,298 --> 00:06:54,511
speaking monitoring.

118
00:06:55,568 --> 00:06:58,380
This is due to their cost.

119
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:02,846
The indicator collection time

120
00:07:03,281 --> 00:07:05,569
and thereby information

121
00:07:05,642 --> 00:07:08,417
to be processed by management

122
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:12,357
to make them much more

123
00:07:14,202 --> 00:07:16,789
costly for management.
