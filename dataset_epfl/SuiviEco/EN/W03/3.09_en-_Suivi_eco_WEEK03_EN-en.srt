1
00:00:10,012 --> 00:00:13,719
Just like with other species, 
start by choosing

2
00:00:13,978 --> 00:00:16,784
 the ecological attributes
to monitor. 

3
00:00:17,191 --> 00:00:20,041
Then, based on these attributes, 

4
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:25,129
select the methods among the ones
we will be presenting shortly

5
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:29,887
that will provide information 
on the indicators to assess.

6
00:00:31,406 --> 00:00:35,318
The direct line-transect method 
is recommended.

7
00:00:35,518 --> 00:00:39,577
In this case, detect the animals 
as follows:

8
00:00:39,777 --> 00:00:43,003
Early in the morning
or in the late afternoon,

9
00:00:43,203 --> 00:00:48,805
observers slowly, at an average speed
of one kilometer per hour,

10
00:00:49,005 --> 00:00:53,000
and quietly work along
the transect line.

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,325
The weather can influence
primate detection.

12
00:00:56,525 --> 00:00:59,754
Some species cry less
in windy conditions

13
00:00:59,954 --> 00:01:05,017
and they are all more difficult
to see when it's raining.

14
00:01:05,217 --> 00:01:11,377
Therefore, avoid counting
during a shower or right after.

15
00:01:12,456 --> 00:01:18,072
As soon as a primate is spotted,
take note of the following information:

16
00:01:19,022 --> 00:01:23,563
the name or transect number,
the distance traveled

17
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,708
along the transect - measured, 
thanks to a (INAUDIBLE),

18
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,863
the date, the time,

19
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:35,550
the detection method - seen, heard,
branch movement, falling fruit,

20
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,092
animals running away, and so on.

21
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:43,502
The species, the distance 
between the observer and the animal,

22
00:01:43,963 --> 00:01:48,165
the angle of observation,
the perpendicular distance

23
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,710
between the animal
and the transect line.

24
00:01:51,037 --> 00:01:53,822
This is measured
with a tape measure, 

25
00:01:54,237 --> 00:02:00,644
a non-elastic rope, or optical
or a laser range-finder.

26
00:02:00,844 --> 00:02:06,790
Also, write down the information
concerning the group of primates:

27
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,583
the number of individuals
in the group by gender,

28
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:12,610
age group, and species,

29
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:16,359
the surface area covered
by the animals

30
00:02:16,521 --> 00:02:22,689
and their main activity: eating,
traveling, social interaction, rest.

31
00:02:24,852 --> 00:02:30,396
To analyse the data,
two or three data sets are needed.

32
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:36,116
One: the distance traveled
along the transect line,

33
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:41,614
which is determined by multiplying
the lines' total length

34
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:44,905
by the number of times it was traveled.

35
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:48,438
Two, the number of groups encountered,

36
00:02:48,563 --> 00:02:53,489
specifically, groups having
both male and female individuals.

37
00:02:53,689 --> 00:02:56,876
Three, the forest surface
on which 

38
00:02:56,994 --> 00:02:59,983
a given number of primates
were recorded.

39
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,495
This is obtained by multiplying
the transect (INAUDIBLE)

40
00:03:03,695 --> 00:03:06,845
by the distance covered.

41
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:11,752
The relative abundance
of a species

42
00:03:11,852 --> 00:03:15,979
or the number of groups
per kilometer  traveled

43
00:03:16,066 --> 00:03:21,249
can be calculated using
the first two sets of data.

44
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:24,739
With all three data sets,

45
00:03:24,814 --> 00:03:28,664
the population density
can be calculated, expressed

46
00:03:28,762 --> 00:03:34,651
in groups per square kilometers
using the DISTANCE software.

47
00:03:34,851 --> 00:03:40,663
which, as Emmanuel explained, considers
detectability variations

48
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,430
of animals in different zones.

49
00:03:44,296 --> 00:03:49,102
Another approach,
indirect this time, is nest counts.

50
00:03:49,302 --> 00:03:53,814
When a nest is spotted,
the process is just similar

51
00:03:53,889 --> 00:03:55,927
to when a primate is detected.

52
00:03:56,032 --> 00:03:59,773
Some information is vital
to capitalizing

53
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:02,232
the nest counts per square kilometer:

54
00:04:02,432 --> 00:04:06,931
namely, the nest construction rate
per individual

55
00:04:07,127 --> 00:04:11,153
given the age differences
and the time it takes

56
00:04:11,203 --> 00:04:15,311
for nests to decay to a point
that can no longer

57
00:04:15,384 --> 00:04:17,784
be identified as such.

58
00:04:18,822 --> 00:04:25,284
This time depends on factors such as
seasons, altitudes, species, etcetera.

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:31,109
Once you have information
concerning nest-making

60
00:04:31,316 --> 00:04:35,574
and their decay rates per site
and per season,

61
00:04:35,926 --> 00:04:40,122
it is possible to calculate
reasonable estimates

62
00:04:40,236 --> 00:04:45,710
of the decline rate of gorilla
or chimpanzee populations.

63
00:04:46,487 --> 00:04:47,855
This often varies.

64
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:53,924
Finally, let's talk about call mapping.

65
00:04:54,891 --> 00:04:59,315
Because of their powerful shouts,
or calls,

66
00:04:59,429 --> 00:05:04,093
some animals can be detected
from a greater distance

67
00:05:04,293 --> 00:05:06,629
than in observations.

68
00:05:07,069 --> 00:05:12,156
This method is especially useful
to indirect monitoring

69
00:05:12,206 --> 00:05:17,786
in places where monkeys
or apes chatter loudly.

70
00:05:18,764 --> 00:05:24,418
In the case of diurnal species,
the observer should start working

71
00:05:24,556 --> 00:05:28,767
early in the morning,
in many cases right before dawn.

72
00:05:29,197 --> 00:05:34,744
Walk slowly at an average pace
of one kilometer per hour

73
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:40,914
and stop at certain marked locations
to listen to the shouts or calls.

74
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:45,697
As soon as he hears the calls,
he should be waiting

75
00:05:45,872 --> 00:05:49,359
between fifteen and thirty minutes
when the interaction

76
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:51,972
between the two groups is over.

77
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:57,823
In the case of nocturnal species,
the detection work depends

78
00:05:57,929 --> 00:05:58,981
on the species.

79
00:05:59,653 --> 00:06:03,641
Generally, bush babies squeal
at nightfall

80
00:06:03,841 --> 00:06:06,979
and for around an hour at dawn.

81
00:06:07,547 --> 00:06:10,960
The task should be repeated
over several days

82
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,919
depending on the species, the site,
the season, and the weather conditions.

83
00:06:16,119 --> 00:06:20,696
For particularly loud species,
like the red colobus,

84
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:24,939
three days can be enough to record
all the groups present

85
00:06:25,026 --> 00:06:26,959
in the survey zone.

86
00:06:27,492 --> 00:06:33,028
But more time is needed
when shouts are scarce and quieter.

87
00:06:33,542 --> 00:06:37,449
Generally speaking, the census
should carry on

88
00:06:37,561 --> 00:06:41,163
until quality sets are obtained.

89
00:06:42,269 --> 00:06:45,645
To record data, proceed as follows:

90
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,593
when the observer hears shouts,

91
00:06:49,681 --> 00:06:53,221
he should take note
of the following information.

92
00:06:53,687 --> 00:06:58,762
The date, the time, the species,
the type of call,

93
00:06:59,147 --> 00:07:04,679
the position of a call to
where the observer is,

94
00:07:05,404 --> 00:07:08,685
the estimated distance
between the observer and the animal,

95
00:07:08,885 --> 00:07:13,571
the observer's geographical coordinates
at that moment.

96
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:17,829
If the same group can be heard

97
00:07:17,866 --> 00:07:20,354
after the observer
has moved away,

98
00:07:20,517 --> 00:07:25,291
a new survey should be carried out
so that the group position

99
00:07:25,454 --> 00:07:31,185
can be calculated more precisely
by means of triangulation.

100
00:07:31,935 --> 00:07:35,285
Finally, the information
should be processed as follows:

101
00:07:35,485 --> 00:07:41,227
draw up a precise map
of a surveyed area on graph paper

102
00:07:41,422 --> 00:07:46,645
and note the main topographic elements
such as waterways, wetland, etcetera,

103
00:07:47,144 --> 00:07:52,501
Copy this map as many times as needed,
so that the data on different species

104
00:07:52,538 --> 00:07:54,389
can be noted separately.

105
00:07:54,514 --> 00:07:58,003
On the map, write down
the date and time

106
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:02,961
on a pencil-drawn line
where the shouts were recorded

107
00:08:03,538 --> 00:08:06,379
and where the observer
was positioned.

108
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:10,631
The distance between the observer
and the animal is estimated

109
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:12,753
and also noted on the map.

110
00:08:13,384 --> 00:08:19,630
Make sure to triangulate the shouts
of a group heard at different moments.

111
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:26,144
Make sure not to count species
that cover great distances quickly

112
00:08:26,156 --> 00:08:29,022
and that can be heard
at different places,

113
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:32,006
like mangabeys, twice.

114
00:08:33,084 --> 00:08:38,054
To reduce this type of mistake,
it is important to know the size

115
00:08:38,293 --> 00:08:42,630
of a surveyed zone, potential overlap
between feeds,

116
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:47,086
and traveling and feeding patterns,
which you can obtain

117
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:49,611
through long time service.

118
00:08:50,822 --> 00:08:56,149
Note on the animals observed
and not heard can also be

119
00:08:56,204 --> 00:08:57,680
written on the map.

120
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:02,307
This will enable you to draw up
a complete table

121
00:09:02,445 --> 00:09:04,717
of all the present groups.
