1
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:10,446
Let's have a look into

2
00:00:10,587 --> 00:00:12,199
a special case of carnivores

3
00:00:12,425 --> 00:00:14,188
by starting with census for 

4
00:00:14,351 --> 00:00:15,730
direct observation on 

5
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:16,944
linear transects.

6
00:00:18,183 --> 00:00:20,630
Two or three observers run the

7
00:00:20,896 --> 00:00:22,817
entire length of the transects

8
00:00:23,017 --> 00:00:25,715
day or night. In a closed environment

9
00:00:25,915 --> 00:00:28,046
like the forest, these prospections

10
00:00:28,246 --> 00:00:31,009
would rather be carried out on foot.

11
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:32,828
In an open environment they are

12
00:00:33,028 --> 00:00:35,186
usually done from a vehicle.

13
00:00:35,386 --> 00:00:37,149
When an animal is spotted

14
00:00:37,349 --> 00:00:40,020
It's perpendicular distance from the

15
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:43,088
transect line is recorded as well as

16
00:00:43,288 --> 00:00:44,999
other relevant observations

17
00:00:45,199 --> 00:00:47,225
regarding the number of individuals,

18
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:49,596
their gender, their age group,

19
00:00:49,796 --> 00:00:50,796
what they are doing,

20
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:52,641
their behaviour, etc.

21
00:00:54,446 --> 00:00:56,894
Well, if the sample size does not 

22
00:00:57,054 --> 00:00:58,883
give an estimation of the population

23
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:01,202
density, you don't have enough data.

24
00:01:01,402 --> 00:01:03,915
The number of animals identified per

25
00:01:04,115 --> 00:01:07,115
kilometre covered at least gives you

26
00:01:07,315 --> 00:01:09,815
an ID of the relative abundance

27
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:13,015
And when the sample size does give

28
00:01:13,215 --> 00:01:15,215
an estimation. The density of

29
00:01:15,481 --> 00:01:17,441
populations can be estimated thanks

30
00:01:17,641 --> 00:01:19,457
to the DISTANCE software, which

31
00:01:19,657 --> 00:01:21,973
Emanuel taught us about earlier.

32
00:01:23,199 --> 00:01:25,673
Of course, you can also carry out

33
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:26,991
a dropping count

34
00:01:27,191 --> 00:01:28,954
along the line of progression

35
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:32,023
this is indirect monitoring.

36
00:01:32,583 --> 00:01:35,668
In this case an observer examines

37
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:37,986
the ground looking for droppings.

38
00:01:38,186 --> 00:01:40,515
While the others they focus on the 

39
00:01:40,755 --> 00:01:42,347
route thanks to a compass, 

40
00:01:42,547 --> 00:01:44,797
for instance. They'll measure the

41
00:01:44,997 --> 00:01:47,997
traveled distance and clear the way.

42
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,513
However, for many carnivore species

43
00:01:52,713 --> 00:01:55,845
in the forest, this approach won't

44
00:01:56,045 --> 00:01:58,860
give any information

45
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:01,837
and it is better to sense droppings

46
00:02:02,037 --> 00:02:04,028
along trails and roads where

47
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:06,184
 they are more visible.

48
00:02:06,466 --> 00:02:09,766
When a heap of droppings is found

49
00:02:10,855 --> 00:02:12,644
measure the width of the strip

50
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:15,621
containing it so that you will be

51
00:02:15,821 --> 00:02:17,886
able to use the Distance software.

52
00:02:18,086 --> 00:02:20,810
Also look at its level of

53
00:02:21,036 --> 00:02:22,576
decomposition and the type of 

54
00:02:22,736 --> 00:02:24,079
vegetation around it.

55
00:02:25,339 --> 00:02:27,060
There is a relation between

56
00:02:27,285 --> 00:02:29,079
the density of carnivores,

57
00:02:29,279 --> 00:02:31,371
especially the big cats,

58
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:34,676
the number of droppings produced

59
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:36,692
 per cat and per day,

60
00:02:36,931 --> 00:02:40,010
 the dropping decomposition rate and

61
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:42,565
 the density of these droppings.

62
00:02:43,341 --> 00:02:45,589
Counting the footprints along

63
00:02:45,764 --> 00:02:48,106
the transects is also a good idea.

64
00:02:48,888 --> 00:02:50,795
This method simply consists in

65
00:02:50,995 --> 00:02:53,364
counting the tracks left by great

66
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:55,485
carnivores along the progression

67
00:02:55,698 --> 00:02:58,395
lines. The number of tracks per

68
00:02:58,608 --> 00:03:00,885
kilometre covered gives you, once 

69
00:03:01,085 --> 00:03:04,098
again a kilometric abundance index.

70
00:03:04,364 --> 00:03:07,403
With all species of large carnivores

71
00:03:07,603 --> 00:03:10,195
the density of tracks is greatly

72
00:03:10,395 --> 00:03:12,198
related to the population density

73
00:03:12,398 --> 00:03:14,569
and there are simple calculation 

74
00:03:14,769 --> 00:03:17,414
methods. Let's take the example

75
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,603
of the lion in this formula.

76
00:03:19,777 --> 00:03:21,898
 Xi is the population density

77
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:23,895
 expressed in number of individuals

78
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:28,030
 per 100 square km. And Ti is the

79
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,401
track density expressed in number of

80
00:03:30,601 --> 00:03:33,982
tracks per 100 kilometre covered.

81
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:37,182
Quite simple, for each track,

82
00:03:37,382 --> 00:03:40,448
record the GPS point, the distance

83
00:03:40,648 --> 00:03:42,490
from the starting position,

84
00:03:42,638 --> 00:03:44,799
 the number of individuals, the age

85
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:46,627
of the track, when it is possible to

86
00:03:46,774 --> 00:03:48,880
record. Whether this track belongs

87
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,251
to an individual from previously 

88
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:53,451
recorded tracks, the type of

89
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:55,480
substrate where the track is spotted

90
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:56,193
and so on.

91
00:03:56,749 --> 00:03:59,078
Some precautions need to be taken to

92
00:03:59,278 --> 00:04:01,463
avoid counting individuals twice.

93
00:04:01,992 --> 00:04:04,294
For example, respect a distance of

94
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:07,442
at least 500 metres before tracks

95
00:04:07,589 --> 00:04:09,431
of an individual of the same species

96
00:04:09,565 --> 00:04:11,434
 can be recorded again.

97
00:04:12,173 --> 00:04:14,489
Eliminate the second observation and

98
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:16,991
the next if identical individual

99
00:04:17,191 --> 00:04:19,362
travel over 500 metres

100
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:21,812
in the same direction.

101
00:04:22,082 --> 00:04:24,622
Also, eliminate tracks of the same

102
00:04:24,822 --> 00:04:27,164
age and size moving about in

103
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:29,548
opposite directions over

104
00:04:29,709 --> 00:04:30,564
short distances.

105
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:34,404
Photographic recording channels will

106
00:04:34,604 --> 00:04:36,854
be done using, for instance,

107
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:40,633
photo traps. In this case the camera

108
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,307
should face a trail often used by

109
00:04:43,507 --> 00:04:45,546
carnivores. To find the right place

110
00:04:45,746 --> 00:04:48,615
look for crossing trails, droppings

111
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:51,341
signs of food, etc. The location

112
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,817
should be narrow enough for animals

113
00:04:53,978 --> 00:04:55,780
to be obliged to come near the

114
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:56,520
camera.

115
00:04:57,101 --> 00:04:59,772
A network of cameras can be set up

116
00:04:59,972 --> 00:05:03,354
through the surveyed zone or at the

117
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:05,501
centre of some sampling you need,

118
00:05:05,675 --> 00:05:07,149
in that case, most of the time,

119
00:05:07,322 --> 00:05:08,572
a quadrant.

120
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,496
You can also put bait in such a way

121
00:05:11,762 --> 00:05:13,407
as to photograph any animal

122
00:05:13,607 --> 00:05:15,620
approaching the bait. This is a

123
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:18,122
good solution when the trails are

124
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:20,862
often used by humans or to sample

125
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:22,825
carnivores rarely using 

126
00:05:23,025 --> 00:05:24,723
the roads and the trails.

127
00:05:25,751 --> 00:05:27,923
Hereby you obtain important 

128
00:05:28,123 --> 00:05:30,504
information on the presence of

129
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:32,020
species in the zone and this

130
00:05:32,154 --> 00:05:33,878
 information may be very important

131
00:05:34,078 --> 00:05:36,512
in itself and sometimes on the 

132
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:39,054
structure of the populations.

133
00:05:39,829 --> 00:05:42,869
For species that can be identified

134
00:05:43,069 --> 00:05:46,069
from the specific trait, such as

135
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:49,269
the shapes on their coats, directly

136
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:52,006
count individuals, describe their 

137
00:05:52,206 --> 00:05:54,469
traveling patterns and calculate 

138
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:56,619
population density from the photos

139
00:05:56,781 --> 00:05:58,906
taken by cameras set up in the

140
00:05:59,081 --> 00:05:59,919
sampling blocks.

141
00:06:00,844 --> 00:06:02,469
This is, in particular, useful for

142
00:06:02,669 --> 00:06:04,181
 leopards, for instance. 

143
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,044
A special technique is also used

144
00:06:06,244 --> 00:06:09,244
to count and monitor lions from,

145
00:06:09,444 --> 00:06:11,881
what we call, calling stations

146
00:06:12,294 --> 00:06:15,069
This simply consists in playing

147
00:06:15,194 --> 00:06:17,544
the sound of a species in distress,

148
00:06:18,006 --> 00:06:20,419
like a young buffalo, to attract

149
00:06:20,619 --> 00:06:23,169
lions in the surrounding areas and

150
00:06:23,369 --> 00:06:25,256
to count them simply.

151
00:06:25,744 --> 00:06:28,456
Usually you would photograph them,

152
00:06:28,744 --> 00:06:30,456
photograph the lion, which come,

153
00:06:30,656 --> 00:06:33,456
to compare individuals between them

154
00:06:33,631 --> 00:06:34,706
and to be able to

155
00:06:34,881 --> 00:06:36,131
 differentiate the lions.

156
00:06:36,381 --> 00:06:38,056
Of course, you need to move the

157
00:06:38,256 --> 00:06:40,144
calling station to try to cover

158
00:06:40,344 --> 00:06:43,006
different territories and this 

159
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:45,231
is usually done by night.

160
00:06:46,819 --> 00:06:48,531
And, as far as possible,

161
00:06:48,731 --> 00:06:51,294
just try to pay attention to the

162
00:06:51,469 --> 00:06:52,406
 lion you attract.

163
00:06:52,606 --> 00:06:53,856
Absolutely.
