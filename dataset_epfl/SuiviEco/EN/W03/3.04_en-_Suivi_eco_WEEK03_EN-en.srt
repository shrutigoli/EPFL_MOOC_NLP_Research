1
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:15,381
Abiotic factors are lifeless 
elements of an environment.

2
00:00:16,035 --> 00:00:21,147
They include physio-chemical factors

3
00:00:21,942 --> 00:00:27,092
and in this case they are climatic
including rainfall,

4
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:31,488
temperature, humidity, 
winds, light, 

5
00:00:31,727 --> 00:00:35,715
or edaphic which is size, 

6
00:00:35,961 --> 00:00:39,373
texture, structure, or PH

7
00:00:39,616 --> 00:00:41,928
and also hydrological 

8
00:00:42,102 --> 00:00:46,465
which includes water 
physio-chemical properties.

9
00:00:46,732 --> 00:00:52,333
Flows, siltations, levels, 
et cetera. 

10
00:00:52,549 --> 00:00:58,349
Elements that impact
the environment's living being.

11
00:00:58,919 --> 00:01:03,719
Abiotic factors are therefore, 
potentially 

12
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:08,875
key ecological attributes 
accessing the health condition

13
00:01:09,064 --> 00:01:12,126
of certain habitats. 

14
00:01:14,509 --> 00:01:18,585
For instance, 
general climatic factors 

15
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:22,569
especially those related 
to rainfall, to winds, 

16
00:01:22,797 --> 00:01:24,472
to temperature 

17
00:01:24,713 --> 00:01:27,401
and to relative humidity 

18
00:01:27,623 --> 00:01:30,760
highly influenced plants 
phenology

19
00:01:31,393 --> 00:01:35,319
which is for instance period 
of flowering, 

20
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:40,956
or period of fruiting, and  also 
leaves renewal. 

21
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:47,067
They also influence fruiting 
and seedling germinations.

22
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,710
Monitoring these factors 
consists in implementing 

23
00:01:53,943 --> 00:01:58,394
an observation system 
on the field 

24
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:04,003
that involves  a synchronic 
observation approach,

25
00:02:04,234 --> 00:02:09,759
as well as diachronic 
observation approach. 

26
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:20,103
The synchronic observation approach
means comparing state 

27
00:02:20,323 --> 00:02:24,697
of the environment to a defined, 
at a defined moment, 

28
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:27,100
within and between territories. 

29
00:02:27,329 --> 00:02:31,092
Meanwhile diachronic 
observation approach 

30
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:36,535
means a comparison 
of environments overtime. 

31
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:41,227
In practice, the heterogeneity 
of the ecosystem 

32
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:47,709
usually requires a representative 
sampling approach 

33
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:52,478
thus, one should start 
by considering 

34
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:54,844
some of the following questions:

35
00:02:55,064 --> 00:03:00,464
what does, are variables 
and indicators 

36
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,498
for change that I should monitor?

37
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:09,349
Another question to ask is 
what is the minimum amount

38
00:03:09,625 --> 00:03:13,737
of data needed to detect 
such a change, 

39
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:20,040
or how to account 
for data collection process.

40
00:03:20,704 --> 00:03:24,505
You may ask more 
or many other questions. 

41
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,833
Then, depending of the factors, 
three line of approach 

42
00:03:31,556 --> 00:03:37,081
in monitoring abiotic factors 
can be identified. 

43
00:03:37,816 --> 00:03:44,015
For case one, consist in 
whether monitoring 

44
00:03:44,249 --> 00:03:47,649
that account for climatic factors. 

45
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:53,096
For case two, accounts 
for hydrological monitoring 

46
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:57,799
that accounts 
for  hydrological factors. 

47
00:03:58,335 --> 00:04:00,185
And for case three,

48
00:04:01,076 --> 00:04:05,713
consist in pedological monitoring 

49
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:10,573
that accounts for edaphic factors. 

50
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:16,757
Whether the monitoring focuses 
on measurements 

51
00:04:17,003 --> 00:04:19,703
of some variables,

52
00:04:21,444 --> 00:04:27,106
including rainfall, 
daily temperature, 

53
00:04:27,294 --> 00:04:29,832
and for measurement 
of daily temperature,

54
00:04:30,055 --> 00:04:33,480
one will need to measure 
the maximum temperature 

55
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:35,909
and the minimum temperature. 

56
00:04:36,494 --> 00:04:40,119
You will also need to measure 
air humidity, 

57
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:45,142
which is the hygrometric contents 
of the air, 

58
00:04:45,356 --> 00:04:50,493
and also, the wind strength 
and the light. 

59
00:04:51,365 --> 00:04:56,402
In fact, indices of rainfall,

60
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:58,820
temperature, 

61
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:02,999
winds strength
and light intensity 

62
00:05:03,216 --> 00:05:06,928
are monitoring indicators 

63
00:05:07,148 --> 00:05:11,973
that ought to be tested
 and validated.

64
00:05:13,208 --> 00:05:19,233
Climatic data measurements 
should be carried out daily 

65
00:05:19,512 --> 00:05:24,574
and always take place 
at the same time 

66
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,270
of the day or night. 

67
00:05:28,857 --> 00:05:34,320
In general, meteorologists
have chosen midnight, 

68
00:05:34,524 --> 00:05:40,662
six am, noon and 6 pm GMT.

69
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:47,181
Within  a protected area, 
hydrological monitoring 

70
00:05:47,408 --> 00:05:51,720
essentially targets surface water.

71
00:05:52,482 --> 00:05:57,457
This focus of ecological monitoring 
is particularly useful

72
00:05:57,715 --> 00:06:02,165
when it comes 
to managing place 

73
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:06,662
in arid and semi arid regions 

74
00:06:06,912 --> 00:06:10,862
where water is a limiting factor. 

75
00:06:12,148 --> 00:06:17,285
The most important viable 
in hydrological monitoring

76
00:06:18,828 --> 00:06:23,553
are the quantity of water 
in stock.

77
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:29,654
You will measuring floods, 
base floor, evaporations

78
00:06:29,891 --> 00:06:33,866
infiltrations, et cetera, 
of water bodies.

79
00:06:35,323 --> 00:06:38,374
You also have to measure 
water quality 

80
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:42,906
which is physio-chemical 
component of water.

81
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:49,198
You have to measure water floors 
and water bodies siltations.

82
00:06:51,966 --> 00:06:53,966
Water levels, 

83
00:06:55,958 --> 00:07:01,245
temperature, PH, oxygen,
conductivity, 

84
00:07:01,456 --> 00:07:06,606
turbidity, height of solid deposits,

85
00:07:06,827 --> 00:07:12,215
and flow velocity, 
which is rate of flows entering 

86
00:07:12,466 --> 00:07:16,966
and leaving the pounds
are protected areas 

87
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:20,128
water body indicators

88
00:07:20,332 --> 00:07:25,707
that  have to be tested 
and approved 

89
00:07:25,918 --> 00:07:30,318
for comparison sync later on. 

90
00:07:32,114 --> 00:07:37,126
The periodicity of hydrological
measurements 

91
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:40,157
is usually seasonal, 

92
00:07:40,331 --> 00:07:44,256
but monthly controls 
of water levels

93
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:49,102
should be considered in dry 
and semi-arid zones 

94
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:52,040
which are example, 
Savannahs

95
00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:56,336
especially in dry seasons. 

96
00:07:56,557 --> 00:08:01,857
The data collected helps 
to elaborate

97
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:08,751
weekly hydrological reports 
in periods of flooding  

98
00:08:08,991 --> 00:08:11,378
and monthly ones, 

99
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:15,354
in low water periods. 

100
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:21,061
Under natural conditions, 
the soil which

101
00:08:21,277 --> 00:08:25,827
 is edaphic components 

102
00:08:26,049 --> 00:08:29,162
does not vary significantly 

103
00:08:29,838 --> 00:08:34,363
in one place from one season
to another. 

104
00:08:35,349 --> 00:08:39,974
Soil monitoring especially 

105
00:08:40,758 --> 00:08:47,108
will target typological variables 
which is type of soils 

106
00:08:47,701 --> 00:08:52,401
and the degradation of 
the other soils

107
00:08:52,681 --> 00:08:56,768
by factors including 
desertification,

108
00:08:57,011 --> 00:09:00,898
erosion, pollutions, et cetera. 

109
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:05,848
In practice, pedological monitoring
also consider 

110
00:09:06,086 --> 00:09:10,686
the land use systems

111
00:09:10,894 --> 00:09:12,406
of your sites. 

112
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:20,306
Above all, indicators consider 
the ratio

113
00:09:21,456 --> 00:09:27,406
of lands affected by 
a phenomenon

114
00:09:27,626 --> 00:09:33,439
including desertification, 
pollution, soil salinity, et cetera.

115
00:09:34,337 --> 00:09:39,250
The data are collected 
through pedological studies

116
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:44,068
including observation 
of the field, 

117
00:09:44,315 --> 00:09:47,102
physio-chemical analysis,

118
00:09:47,348 --> 00:09:50,761
description of soil profiles, 
et cetera, 

119
00:09:50,986 --> 00:09:56,186
and also, through 
socio-economic studies 

120
00:09:56,972 --> 00:10:00,247
and remote detections

121
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,391
including cartographies, 
et cetera. 

122
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:08,258
The periodicity of data collection

123
00:10:08,436 --> 00:10:13,586
for pedological data monitoring 
by process depends 

124
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:16,884
on the problematic 

125
00:10:17,694 --> 00:10:21,819
synchronic and diachronic 
data collected 

126
00:10:22,031 --> 00:10:27,381
or all these series of data 
should at the end 

127
00:10:27,652 --> 00:10:33,052
help validating indicators 
of change. 

128
00:10:33,271 --> 00:10:39,121
The idea is to proceed 
to comparative analysis 

129
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,085
between indicators to understand

130
00:10:43,311 --> 00:10:47,786
the shifting trends
that would be observed 

131
00:10:47,998 --> 00:10:52,949
especially related to living beings

132
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,732
in the ecosystems.
