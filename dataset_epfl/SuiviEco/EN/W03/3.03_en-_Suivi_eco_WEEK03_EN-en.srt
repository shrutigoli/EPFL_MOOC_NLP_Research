1
00:00:09,095 --> 00:00:14,047
We've seen that ecological
characteristics of animal species

2
00:00:14,254 --> 00:00:18,199
influence the choice 
of key ecological attributes

3
00:00:18,399 --> 00:00:21,212
that will define 
the species' condition.

4
00:00:21,845 --> 00:00:25,609
But ecological specificity
also play a part in choosing

5
00:00:25,809 --> 00:00:29,069
the surveying method 
and the sampling plan to implement.

6
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:32,464
The type of habitat is key 
in choosing 

7
00:00:32,694 --> 00:00:36,311
the surveying method 
to apply to the field.

8
00:00:36,838 --> 00:00:39,027
If the species are difficult
to spot

9
00:00:39,227 --> 00:00:41,509
because they live in an area
with dense vegetation,

10
00:00:41,709 --> 00:00:45,667
indirect methods proving
the presence of the species

11
00:00:45,867 --> 00:00:48,562
and giving an idea of the number,
by following

12
00:00:48,762 --> 00:00:52,735
the droppings, nests, 
the tracks, etc., should be used.

13
00:00:53,688 --> 00:00:57,884
For instance, small antelopes
lives in forests and the (INAUDIBLE).

14
00:00:58,288 --> 00:01:00,435
It is therefore, quite difficult
to spot them.

15
00:01:00,635 --> 00:01:04,526
But they are territorial,
and mark their territory

16
00:01:04,726 --> 00:01:06,580
by visible droppings.

17
00:01:06,793 --> 00:01:11,627
In this case, these elements are 
the ones that should be monitored. 

18
00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:15,757
On the other hand, larger species
living in open spaces

19
00:01:15,982 --> 00:01:19,774
can be subject to direct ground-based
or aerial surveying.

20
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,096
So now, what about sampling 
and the ecological factors

21
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:27,477
that may or will
guide it?

22
00:01:28,228 --> 00:01:32,164
In this case, the area over which
a species is distributed

23
00:01:32,364 --> 00:01:34,776
or it's daily and seasonal 
travel region

24
00:01:34,976 --> 00:01:39,116
influence the method to use
and the way it should be implemented.

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:44,291
Thereby, species distributed over
smaller area

26
00:01:44,491 --> 00:01:47,953
will undergo closer monitoring
of it's overall population

27
00:01:48,153 --> 00:01:51,633
compared to species covering
more ground.

28
00:01:51,833 --> 00:01:54,476
In this case, the species
will be monitored by 

29
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:58,478
a random sampling process in
the entire park.

30
00:01:59,596 --> 00:02:02,768
Obviously, if you want to assess
a change of population

31
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:06,399
a smaller bit maybe, more 
samples need to be collected

32
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,001
in order to be able to detect
this change.

33
00:02:09,469 --> 00:02:12,766
Also if a species move over
different habitats,

34
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,774
it's not a bad idea to consider
the proceeding

35
00:02:15,974 --> 00:02:19,887
to stratified sampling 
where each stratum is represented

36
00:02:20,103 --> 00:02:23,215
by one of the possible habitats
used by the species.

37
00:02:24,434 --> 00:02:27,179
Ecological factors also influence
the time

38
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:29,844
when surveying should take place.

39
00:02:30,071 --> 00:02:32,908
To maximize the possibilities
to observe

40
00:02:33,229 --> 00:02:36,668
the monitored species, the surveying,
the monitoring 

41
00:02:36,868 --> 00:02:41,474
needs to take place at 
a time of year or of the day

42
00:02:41,674 --> 00:02:46,106
when it is most active and easiest
to observe, of course.

43
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:49,367
For instance, wild beasts leave
Serengeti in Tanzania

44
00:02:49,592 --> 00:02:52,887
to enjoy the greener pastures
of the Maasai Mara in Kenya.

45
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:55,271
when it already raining there.

46
00:02:55,471 --> 00:02:57,442
So, the managers of the Serengeti
National Park

47
00:02:57,642 --> 00:03:00,795
and the Maasai Mara Reserve,
will proceed to do monitoring

48
00:03:01,138 --> 00:03:03,303
of these wild beasts at different
times in the year,

49
00:03:03,503 --> 00:03:05,765
according to this animal rhythm.

50
00:03:06,356 --> 00:03:08,870
Yes.
So finally, there are also

51
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,174
ecological factors that influence 
the frequency of data collection.

52
00:03:14,071 --> 00:03:17,132
The more the considered species
is likely to adapt rapidly

53
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:19,609
to new constraints, 
like changing territory

54
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:22,772
to escape threat, for instance, 
the more you will need

55
00:03:22,972 --> 00:03:24,601
to increase 
the frequency of surveying

56
00:03:24,801 --> 00:03:27,394
in order to be able to detect 
this change on time,

57
00:03:27,635 --> 00:03:30,252
and take then the right 
management actions.

58
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:34,967
Conversely, for instance, 
to monitor a normal increase

59
00:03:35,167 --> 00:03:38,961
of the elephant population, 
it is useless to proceed

60
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:45,037
to early counts as natural growth
is around 5 to 6 percent.

61
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:49,668
In this case it is better to go
4 or 5, or 10 years

62
00:03:49,868 --> 00:03:52,688
surveying frequency, 
which will allow 

63
00:03:52,888 --> 00:03:55,681
to follow the population
at lowest cost.

64
00:03:56,506 --> 00:03:59,175
In short, the concept of ecology
to master 

65
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,146
in order to design an ecological
monitoring plan

66
00:04:02,346 --> 00:04:05,402
of a given species that will make
surveying easier,

67
00:04:05,602 --> 00:04:08,823
are to know, first, the suitable
habitat of the species.

68
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:12,738
It's social system, to determine
the composition of the groups,

69
00:04:12,938 --> 00:04:14,307
and their seasonal variations.

70
00:04:14,507 --> 00:04:19,613
The frequency and the way
daily and seasonal travels occurs.

71
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:23,032
The normal growth rate
of it's population.

72
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:26,414
It's tolerance to the threats,
such as poaching,

73
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:29,823
competition with other species,
either world or domestic.

74
00:04:30,023 --> 00:04:32,169
Also human presence, 
change of habitat

75
00:04:32,369 --> 00:04:33,817
and other kind of threats.

76
00:04:34,605 --> 00:04:38,176
And the type of visible markers
that indicate

77
00:04:38,376 --> 00:04:41,600
it's presence, like nests,
we saw that for chimps.

78
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:46,239
droppings, tracks, broken trees,
if we are talking of elephants.
