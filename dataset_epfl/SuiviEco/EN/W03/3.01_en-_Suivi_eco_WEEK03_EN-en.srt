00:00:09,199 --> 00:00:14,637
Hello, and welcome this third unit
of our MOOC on ecological monitoring.

2
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:18,115
In this unit, we will introduce

3
00:00:18,215 --> 00:00:20,657
different ecological 
monitoring techniques.

4
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:24,619
This will help us better grasp
what ecological monitoring

5
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:27,998
practically looks like on the field.

6
00:00:28,772 --> 00:00:31,412
Inza Kone, social professor at the

7
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:34,095
Félix Houphouët-Boigny University
of Côte d'Ivoire.

8
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:39,456
and Emmanuel Ima, social professor 
at the Ki-Zerbo University in Burkina le Faso

9
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:42,341
will be helping us out.

10
00:00:43,617 --> 00:00:47,768
Let's follow the impalas to see
what the techniques mentioned

11
00:00:47,968 --> 00:00:49,518
in this unit will be.

12
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:55,633
First, we will examine
what key ecological attributes

13
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:59,187
 should be monitored
and how to identify them.

14
00:01:00,623 --> 00:01:06,194
Then, we will talk about the choices
of method and sampling most adapted

15
00:01:06,281 --> 00:01:07,535
to the attributes.

16
00:01:08,458 --> 00:01:12,722
After this, we will look at ways
of following the ecosystems

17
00:01:12,922 --> 00:01:16,834
abiotic component, the ones
supporting life.

18
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:22,435
We will also specifically focus
on monitoring plants.

19
00:01:22,823 --> 00:01:27,437
Big mammals will then be
our point of interest,

20
00:01:27,637 --> 00:01:32,208
either by direct counting
or by indirect counting.

21
00:01:32,408 --> 00:01:36,270
Both are obviously
very different techniques.

22
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:39,862
Next up, we will talk
about the specific case 

23
00:01:40,062 --> 00:01:44,123
of large carnivore monitoring,
with some lions, for example.

24
00:01:44,995 --> 00:01:48,686
Then, our friend Inza will share
about his specialty,

25
00:01:48,748 --> 00:01:52,032
the very specific monitoring
of primates.

26
00:01:53,322 --> 00:01:57,357
As we zoom out a little bit,
we will talk about aerial counting

27
00:01:55,432 --> 00:01:58,432


28
00:01:57,632 --> 00:02:01,479
which can be useful
in certain circumstances.

29
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:05,892
And we will finish the unit
with Emmanuel 

30
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:08,904
by looking at animals
that move around a lot

31
00:02:09,017 --> 00:02:12,343
and the specific tools needed
to monitor them.

32
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,856
There you go. 

33
00:02:14,973 --> 00:02:19,571
Remember, the quizzes between the sequences
that will help you better understand

34
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,429
all these techniques
and have an excellent third unit.
