1
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,455
The ecological characteristics

2
00:00:10,655 --> 00:00:12,219
of animal species to monitor

3
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,061
influence the ecological monitoring.

4
00:00:15,261 --> 00:00:16,099
In particular,

5
00:00:16,299 --> 00:00:19,047
regarding the choice 
of key ecological attributes,

6
00:00:19,247 --> 00:00:20,906
the surveying methods,

7
00:00:21,106 --> 00:00:24,365
or monitoring plans
to implement.

8
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:26,476
As we have already seen,

9
00:00:26,676 --> 00:00:29,616
monitoring key ecological attributes

10
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,921
show the conditions 
of the monitored species.

11
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:34,194
There are 3 types of attributes.

12
00:00:34,394 --> 00:00:37,117
The size and distribution 
of the species.

13
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:40,049
Its composition 
and population dynamics.

14
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:42,646
And the quality of its habitat.

15
00:00:43,496 --> 00:00:44,900
Obviously,

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:48,100
it is not about monitoring 
all of these parameters,

17
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,141
but to choose the ones

18
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,202
that will give the best information

19
00:00:52,402 --> 00:00:53,846
on the species' condition

20
00:00:54,046 --> 00:00:55,895
and at the lowest cost.

21
00:00:56,808 --> 00:00:58,561
The choice depends essentially

22
00:00:58,648 --> 00:01:00,165
on the ecology of the species.

23
00:01:00,365 --> 00:01:02,308
The chosen ecological attributes

24
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:03,506
should also reflect

25
00:01:03,556 --> 00:01:05,971
the abnormal modification 
of the population,

26
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:09,101
so that quick reaction
can be put in place if needed.

27
00:01:10,076 --> 00:01:13,805
The ecological attributes' 
size of the population

28
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:15,872
can vary abnormally.

29
00:01:16,072 --> 00:01:16,992
For instance,

30
00:01:17,192 --> 00:01:19,968
for example, it can decrease
due to poaching,

31
00:01:20,168 --> 00:01:22,463
which would require an intervention.

32
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:25,938
But it can also vary
due to some natural phenomenon.

33
00:01:26,138 --> 00:01:29,004
Elephants, for instance, 
tend to travel seasonally

34
00:01:29,204 --> 00:01:31,943
far beyond the limits 
of the protected area to find food.

35
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:33,523
During the dry season

36
00:01:33,723 --> 00:01:35,379
you will find them around the pond

37
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:37,458
looking for water.

38
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:38,916
And during 
the rainy season,

39
00:01:38,953 --> 00:01:40,453
where there 
is plenty of water,

40
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:42,248
they can spread 
over vast areas.

41
00:01:42,693 --> 00:01:43,834
For this reason

42
00:01:44,034 --> 00:01:47,709
the number of elephants 
in the protected area can fluctuate,

43
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:50,005
but it doesn't necessarily mean

44
00:01:50,205 --> 00:01:52,769
the population is in bad condition.

45
00:01:53,586 --> 00:01:56,126
The distribution of the species
on the other hand,

46
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:59,013
depends on the quality 
of the suitable habitat

47
00:01:59,213 --> 00:02:00,789
within the protected area.

48
00:02:00,989 --> 00:02:02,877
But also on the species' tolerance

49
00:02:03,077 --> 00:02:05,270
of other species 
or potential risks.

50
00:02:06,491 --> 00:02:07,616
For instance,

51
00:02:07,816 --> 00:02:10,816
if the distribution map of a park

52
00:02:11,016 --> 00:02:13,622
shows that 
concentration of a species

53
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:17,464
is in areas that are far 
from the park's boundaries,

54
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:16,822


55
00:02:17,664 --> 00:02:20,499
once grazing is possible everywhere,

56
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:23,474
it could show that
there is a poaching threat

57
00:02:23,524 --> 00:02:26,040
coming from the surrounding areas.

58
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:28,030
The  distribution 
of the animal species

59
00:02:28,047 --> 00:02:31,047


60
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:29,837
is therefore is a good indicator 

61
00:02:29,887 --> 00:02:32,085
for the condition 
of the species in the park

62
00:02:32,123 --> 00:02:34,247
and of the location 
of possible threats.

63
00:02:35,195 --> 00:02:38,033
The second type 
of ecological attribute

64
00:02:38,233 --> 00:02:40,461
is a structure of animal population.

65
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:43,019
It is characterized normally

66
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:45,258
by the size of the groups,

67
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:49,014
or the numbers 
of families it consists of.

68
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:52,903
The size depends 
on the social system

69
00:02:52,978 --> 00:02:54,319
of the species in question.

70
00:02:53,103 --> 00:02:56,103


71
00:02:54,881 --> 00:02:56,180
For example,

72
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,763
zebra herds gather several families.

73
00:02:58,963 --> 00:02:59,979
The size of the group

74
00:03:00,179 --> 00:03:02,743
depends on the difficulty 
to find water and food

75
00:03:02,943 --> 00:03:04,515
in the considered area.

76
00:03:04,715 --> 00:03:06,012
The more food there is,

77
00:03:06,212 --> 00:03:07,620
the larger the group will be. 

78
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:10,029
And if the conditions
of the habitat gets bad

79
00:03:10,117 --> 00:03:12,822
the group splits up
to form smaller units.

80
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:14,020


81
00:03:13,297 --> 00:03:16,986
Thus, monitoring looks 
at the size of groups

82
00:03:17,186 --> 00:03:20,361
and detects
if the population suffers,

83
00:03:20,561 --> 00:03:21,243
let's say,

84
00:03:21,443 --> 00:03:23,984
and has to adapt 
to difficult conditions.

85
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:26,668
Some species form large flocks,

86
00:03:26,868 --> 00:03:27,859
like the buffalos,

87
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:29,975
while others stick to family units

88
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:31,386
with few individuals

89
00:03:31,457 --> 00:03:33,166
like the [INAUDIBLE], for instance.

90
00:03:33,758 --> 00:03:36,914
So you need to have 
a rather good knowledge 

91
00:03:37,114 --> 00:03:38,762
of the normal social structure

92
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:40,126
of the different species

93
00:03:40,326 --> 00:03:42,785
to detect any form of anomaly

94
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:44,147
during the monitoring.

95
00:03:44,882 --> 00:03:45,414
Finally,

96
00:03:45,464 --> 00:03:47,747
the third type 
of ecological attribute

97
00:03:47,822 --> 00:03:49,036
to take into account

98
00:03:49,236 --> 00:03:50,749
is the species' habitat.

99
00:03:50,949 --> 00:03:51,902
Indeed,

100
00:03:51,939 --> 00:03:54,313
to survive, 
animals need the suitable habitat

101
00:03:54,513 --> 00:03:57,335
one in which they can get
food and water, obviously,

102
00:03:57,535 --> 00:04:00,759
and also find the right conditions 
for their reproduction.

103
00:04:01,682 --> 00:04:05,020
Species can be dependent 
on a particular habitat,

104
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,127
like some water birds,
for instance,

105
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:09,753
are dependent on permanent wetlands

106
00:04:09,953 --> 00:04:10,899
within the park.

107
00:04:11,636 --> 00:04:14,551
So monitoring 
the quality of this habitat,

108
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:16,007
the wetlands in this case,

109
00:04:16,207 --> 00:04:18,963
and especially the evolution
of invasive plants

110
00:04:19,163 --> 00:04:21,483
that may invade those ponds

111
00:04:21,683 --> 00:04:25,124
is key to the monitoring
of the survival of those species

112
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:26,497
within the protected area.

113
00:04:26,697 --> 00:04:27,790
You need to know

114
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:30,846
the ecological characteristics
of the monitored species

115
00:04:31,046 --> 00:04:32,555
to be able to identify

116
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:34,448
what key ecological attribute

117
00:04:34,648 --> 00:04:36,975
would be the most 
relevant to monitor

118
00:04:37,175 --> 00:04:38,955
in order to differentiate

119
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:41,761
natural variation
of its population's condition

120
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,840
 from abnormal ones

121
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,612
 within the territory.
