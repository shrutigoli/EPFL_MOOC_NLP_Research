1
00:00:09,025 --> 00:00:11,419
Direct mammal monitoring

2
00:00:11,619 --> 00:00:13,300
relies on the study

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,875
of the state and the evolution
of animal populations,

4
00:00:18,075 --> 00:00:20,515
as well as 
the influence of pressures

5
00:00:20,715 --> 00:00:22,568
on said population

6
00:00:22,656 --> 00:00:24,914
through direct 
observation of individuals

7
00:00:24,989 --> 00:00:26,892
or group of animals. 

8
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:28,190
In practice,

9
00:00:28,390 --> 00:00:30,729
it consists in monitoring the trends

10
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:33,279
of certain key
ecological attributes

11
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,236
of this population.

12
00:00:35,436 --> 00:00:38,436
The most common ones are density,

13
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:39,947
distribution,

14
00:00:40,147 --> 00:00:43,147
or shifting trends 
of this population,

15
00:00:43,347 --> 00:00:47,745
as well as in direction
it can have with its habitat.

16
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:51,861
The choice of the assessment methods

17
00:00:52,061 --> 00:00:53,384
of these parameters

18
00:00:53,584 --> 00:00:56,510
is key to direct animal 
population monitoring.

19
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:59,236
The type of method chosen

20
00:00:59,436 --> 00:01:01,840
depends on simple questions.

21
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,935
Such as,

22
00:01:03,135 --> 00:01:06,709
"Which ecological attribute
should I monitor?"

23
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:09,909
"Which indicators should I follow

24
00:01:10,109 --> 00:01:12,368
for each of these 
ecological attributes?"

25
00:01:12,568 --> 00:01:13,572
Et cetera.

26
00:01:15,209 --> 00:01:18,207
We can take the example
of ecological attributes

27
00:01:18,407 --> 00:01:20,851
related to the population size,

28
00:01:21,051 --> 00:01:22,955
average density,

29
00:01:23,155 --> 00:01:24,491
group sizes,

30
00:01:24,691 --> 00:01:26,450
distribution per habitat. 

31
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,912
We can also at

32
00:01:28,112 --> 00:01:30,389
attributes describing the structure

33
00:01:30,589 --> 00:01:32,625
and the population dynamics,

34
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:34,933
gender, or age ratio,

35
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:38,890
data related to health conditions,
for instance.

36
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:43,417
But it is also important to see

37
00:01:43,617 --> 00:01:46,617
what the minimum data needed

38
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:50,319
to monitor the population is.

39
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,900
This will help define

40
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,631
the collection cycle,

41
00:01:54,831 --> 00:01:56,036
or periodicity,

42
00:01:56,236 --> 00:01:58,914
as well as its duration.

43
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,150
Many inventory techniques

44
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,719
can be used, of course.

45
00:02:04,919 --> 00:02:07,900
Among them, as we saw in Unit 2,

46
00:02:07,014 --> 00:02:10,014


47
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:10,689
total count methods 
can be carried out,

48
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:15,231
as well as methods
based on sample.

49
00:02:15,431 --> 00:02:17,906
In the case of total count,

50
00:02:18,106 --> 00:02:21,593
the entire study zone is inspected.

51
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:24,793
And statistical calculation,
if any,

52
00:02:24,993 --> 00:02:28,311
only concerns 
the estimation of bias.

53
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:30,920
Total counting on food, 
for example,

54
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,495
is based 
on the individual inclination

55
00:02:33,695 --> 00:02:37,665
of all animals seen by the observer.

56
00:02:37,865 --> 00:02:41,084
This technique can be applied

57
00:02:41,284 --> 00:02:43,596
to a great number of species,

58
00:02:43,796 --> 00:02:46,525
such as elephants, giraffes, rhinos,

59
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:48,545
most predators,

60
00:02:48,745 --> 00:02:52,547
and some antelopes 
that are easy to spot.

61
00:02:52,747 --> 00:02:54,406
Most of the time, big species

62
00:02:54,606 --> 00:02:57,606
that you can see 
easily on the field.

63
00:02:57,806 --> 00:02:59,290
As said earlier,

64
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,943
sampling should be 
carried out at random,

65
00:03:02,143 --> 00:03:03,056
for the number

66
00:03:03,256 --> 00:03:06,431
to be representative 
of the entire animal population.

67
00:03:06,631 --> 00:03:08,718
In practice, the sample units

68
00:03:08,918 --> 00:03:11,288
can take on multiple forms. 

69
00:03:11,488 --> 00:03:13,360
The most commonly used

70
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,521
are quadrats and transects.

71
00:03:16,169 --> 00:03:19,169
Quadrats are based on the idea

72
00:03:19,369 --> 00:03:21,035
of visually counting

73
00:03:21,235 --> 00:03:22,598
 the number of individuals

74
00:03:22,798 --> 00:03:27,355
 inside a predefined plot 
set at random

75
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:29,525
in the studied zone.

76
00:03:29,725 --> 00:03:33,450
All individuals observed
outside this plot

77
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:34,824
are not counted.

78
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:38,024
The estimation of the population

79
00:03:38,224 --> 00:03:39,869
consists in calculating

80
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:42,257
the density of the sample

81
00:03:42,457 --> 00:03:45,132
which is the ratio
between number

82
00:03:45,332 --> 00:03:48,434
of counted individuals, 
counted animals

83
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:49,547
in the quadrat,

84
00:03:49,747 --> 00:03:51,633
and its surface area,

85
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,317
and to extend this number

86
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:56,903
to the total surface of the zone,

87
00:03:57,103 --> 00:04:00,241
to obtain, of course, an estimate 
of the global population

88
00:04:00,441 --> 00:04:02,433
of the monitored species.

89
00:04:02,633 --> 00:04:06,318
And for inventories by line transect

90
00:04:06,518 --> 00:04:08,916
the method consists

91
00:04:09,116 --> 00:04:11,076
in searching animals

92
00:04:11,276 --> 00:04:16,115
along a line of undetermined width.

93
00:04:16,315 --> 00:04:19,183
The animal's perpendicular distance

94
00:04:19,383 --> 00:04:22,910
to this transect line is noted.

95
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,583


96
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:24,606
And in practice,

97
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,780
three measurements are taken
per observation. 

98
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,429
These are the radial distance,

99
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,283
the viewing angle,

100
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:30,629


101
00:04:30,829 --> 00:04:33,829


102
00:04:32,483 --> 00:04:34,309
and the perpendicular distance.

103
00:04:34,509 --> 00:04:38,117
The transect line
can be traveled on foot,

104
00:04:38,317 --> 00:04:39,686
on horseback, 

105
00:04:39,886 --> 00:04:43,967
by car, or by whatever mean
you may have.

106
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:46,761
You could use a bike, of course.

107
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:49,011
Density estimate is then obtained

108
00:04:49,211 --> 00:04:50,776
by a formula that considers

109
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:52,862
the number of observations,

110
00:04:53,062 --> 00:04:54,843
the total transect length,

111
00:04:55,043 --> 00:04:58,175
the width of the line 
of the observation strip

112
00:04:58,263 --> 00:04:59,824
which is determined, once again,

113
00:04:59,911 --> 00:05:02,593
by the distance 
at which animals are seen,

114
00:05:02,793 --> 00:05:05,991
and the detection
probability function.

115
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:08,657
And there are several estimators

116
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:10,705
of this function 

117
00:05:10,905 --> 00:05:14,057
that are widely documented
in the literature.

118
00:05:14,257 --> 00:05:17,796
Distance is a specialized software

119
00:05:17,996 --> 00:05:22,457
that can help you to
estimate the functions.

120
00:05:23,118 --> 00:05:24,395
Another technique,

121
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:26,900
the capture-recapture technique,

122
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,490
is a method often used

123
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:33,103
when data on mobile species
need to be collected.

124
00:05:33,303 --> 00:05:34,986
It is a special technique,

125
00:05:35,186 --> 00:05:38,369
where a known number 
of animals of a species

126
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:41,154
is marked and released.

127
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:44,982
And based on the hypothesis

128
00:05:45,182 --> 00:05:48,633
that the population 
of marked individuals

129
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,255
compared to non-marked individuals

130
00:05:51,455 --> 00:05:53,798
is the same in the sample

131
00:05:53,998 --> 00:05:56,143
as in the entire population.

132
00:05:56,343 --> 00:05:58,831
The share of marked

133
00:05:59,031 --> 00:06:01,246
and non-marked animals

134
00:06:01,446 --> 00:06:03,516
that will be captured next,

135
00:06:03,716 --> 00:06:05,121
will be used

136
00:06:05,321 --> 00:06:09,463
to estimate the total number
of animals within the population.

137
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:15,714
There are different 
capture and recapture methods.

138
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:17,444
The choice depends

139
00:06:17,644 --> 00:06:21,000
on whether you work
on closed population,

140
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,329
in other words,

141
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:25,960
one that is not in contact
with population outside

142
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,363
the protected area.

143
00:06:27,563 --> 00:06:30,923
Or you work on open population

144
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:33,639
when protected area individuals

145
00:06:33,839 --> 00:06:36,371
migrate outside the protected area.

146
00:06:37,433 --> 00:06:38,777
Quite often,

147
00:06:38,977 --> 00:06:42,928
another method is also 
used very frequently.

148
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:45,603
The kilometric (abundance) index.

149
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:47,689
It is based on observations

150
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:49,829
made during walking surveillance, 

151
00:06:49,892 --> 00:06:51,009
patrols, for instance,

152
00:06:51,209 --> 00:06:54,604
corrected depending on [INAUDIBLE].

153
00:06:54,804 --> 00:06:55,873
For instance,

154
00:06:56,073 --> 00:06:56,856
the walking time. 

155
00:06:57,056 --> 00:06:59,029
The more you walk, the more you see.

156
00:06:59,229 --> 00:07:00,939
This essentially helps

157
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:04,550
to detect population variations 
over time.

158
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,426
One technique especially

159
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:09,160
consists in looking 
for noncturnal animals

160
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,738
with rump.

161
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:12,395
But this method is not suited

162
00:07:12,595 --> 00:07:16,707
to sensing species 
with low or very low density.

163
00:07:16,907 --> 00:07:20,307
The punctual abundance index

164
00:07:20,507 --> 00:07:22,470
is a technique consisting

165
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:25,670
in counting animals
at a certain fixed point.

166
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,469
Like waterholes, for example.

167
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:32,283
And to monitor population
fluctuation over time.

168
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:35,011
This technique 
is usually carried out

169
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:36,462
from a hideout 

170
00:07:36,662 --> 00:07:40,282
at a set time and duration.

171
00:07:40,482 --> 00:07:42,646
And the measurement
should be repeated

172
00:07:42,846 --> 00:07:45,846
to have enough data.

173
00:07:46,046 --> 00:07:47,862
Measuring the group size

174
00:07:48,062 --> 00:07:51,619
is also a technique 
that is used sometimes.

175
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,866
And for some herbivores,

176
00:07:54,066 --> 00:07:58,391
the group size depends
on abundance of species

177
00:07:58,591 --> 00:08:00,552
in the environment.

178
00:08:00,627 --> 00:08:03,298
[INAUDIBLE] monitoring of this indicator

179
00:08:03,498 --> 00:08:05,538
helped detect fluctuations

180
00:08:05,738 --> 00:08:07,436
in species density.

181
00:08:07,636 --> 00:08:08,783
For example,

182
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:11,536
group size of mountain goat

183
00:08:11,736 --> 00:08:15,101
tend to increase 
when the density increases.

184
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:17,244
Monitoring a sample

185
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:21,798
would then allow
to estimate abundance variation,

186
00:08:21,998 --> 00:08:24,747
without having to count 
the entire population

187
00:08:24,947 --> 00:08:27,640
Which indeed is a much simpler way.

188
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,303
In all cases,

189
00:08:29,503 --> 00:08:32,503
monitoring techniques
require a good capacity

190
00:08:32,703 --> 00:08:34,597
to identify species,

191
00:08:34,797 --> 00:08:37,584
and to be able to estimate numbers

192
00:08:37,784 --> 00:08:41,449
upon very brief, sometimes,
visual contacts.

193
00:08:41,649 --> 00:08:44,242
Biological knowledge of the species

194
00:08:44,442 --> 00:08:46,228
is also key

195
00:08:46,428 --> 00:08:48,232
to predict their behavior

196
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:50,777
in the presence of observers.

197
00:08:50,977 --> 00:08:52,180
Finally,

198
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,483
observation conditions
should be good.

199
00:08:55,683 --> 00:08:57,740
One should avoid windy,

200
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,542
dusty, too hot or rainy conditions.

201
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:05,055
Observers should move quietly,

202
00:09:05,255 --> 00:09:07,044
that's the very least,

203
00:09:07,244 --> 00:09:09,347
and consider animal reactivity,

204
00:09:09,547 --> 00:09:13,200
especially in areas 
prone to poaching.

205
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:18,025
Direct monitoring has the perk

206
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:21,954
of giving information
on the conditions

207
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:23,747
of pack animals.

208
00:09:23,947 --> 00:09:26,042
But is not applicable

209
00:09:26,242 --> 00:09:29,789
to hard-to-spot 
or secretive species.
