1
00:00:08,914 --> 00:00:12,989
Aerial monitoring is an ecological
monitoring technique

2
00:00:13,204 --> 00:00:17,091
commonly used in protected areas, 
particularly in Africa

3
00:00:17,309 --> 00:00:21,096
where protected areas 
can be quite vast. 

4
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:24,141
It essentially relies on the use 
of an aircraft 

5
00:00:24,368 --> 00:00:26,567
but other instruments 
can also be used

6
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:30,144
like ULMs, drones, kites. 

7
00:00:30,836 --> 00:00:34,886
Some conditions determine
this choice of method. 

8
00:00:35,155 --> 00:00:38,318
First, the protected area 
should be sizeable. 

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:41,535
This means that for a best 
cost effective 

10
00:00:41,771 --> 00:00:45,008
or cost benefit ratio, 
monitoring a park 

11
00:00:45,248 --> 00:00:50,260
of less than 1000 square kilometers,
100,000 hectares, 

12
00:00:50,472 --> 00:00:53,134
should be ground-based.

13
00:00:53,349 --> 00:00:56,099
The environment needs 
to be open, in deed, 

14
00:00:56,315 --> 00:00:59,578
aerial monitoring is not adopted
to closed area like forest

15
00:00:59,778 --> 00:01:03,828
or un-even terrain where the ground 
cannot be seen.

16
00:01:04,383 --> 00:01:09,733
Finally, the species we look for 
need be visible from air, of course.

17
00:01:09,923 --> 00:01:12,711
They would usually be 
the bigger mammals 

18
00:01:12,926 --> 00:01:17,164
or species living in large herds 
like impalas 

19
00:01:17,354 --> 00:01:19,092
or buffaloes in this case. 

20
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:22,974
You can also choose
to monitor the floral distribution.

21
00:01:23,627 --> 00:01:26,927
So the main objective 
of aerial monitoring is to be able

22
00:01:27,132 --> 00:01:29,895
to estimate the numbers 
and monitor the evolution of one

23
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:32,517
or more spaces in time 
and in space 

24
00:01:32,712 --> 00:01:35,225
by connecting periodic surveys. 

25
00:01:35,442 --> 00:01:38,942
The aerial monitoring also gives 
a different perspective 

26
00:01:39,143 --> 00:01:40,956
of the territory. 

27
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:43,870
A border and more 
comprehensive view

28
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:47,167
compared to the traditional 
ground based monitoring,

29
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:51,357
it is a good tool 
to better understand 

30
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:53,885
how the ecosystem works. 

31
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:57,963
It allows to confirmed 
the existence of certain species  

32
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,634
when they are hard 
to detect by other means. 

33
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:03,846
It provides an estimation 
of the numbers 

34
00:02:04,073 --> 00:02:07,461
within the detected species 
as well as an estimation

35
00:02:07,651 --> 00:02:11,826
of the size or the structure
of the groups. 

36
00:02:12,066 --> 00:02:15,453
Obviously, it allows to understand 
the special distribution 

37
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,525
of the species in the park, 
and shows the evolutionary number

38
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:23,781
and distribution when the counting 
is repeated overtime. 

39
00:02:23,994 --> 00:02:27,681
When you have a map
of the protected area's vegetation, 

40
00:02:27,887 --> 00:02:32,137
aerial monitoring allows to connect 
the distribution of species 

41
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:34,922
and of different habitats. 

42
00:02:35,653 --> 00:02:38,853
It also gives important additional 
information for management

43
00:02:39,074 --> 00:02:41,024
like signs of poaching, carcasses, 

44
00:02:41,231 --> 00:02:43,393
the presence of cattle 
or human activities

45
00:02:43,617 --> 00:02:46,292
like gold mining, encroachment 
of the park boundaries 

46
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:48,040
and nogging for instance. 

47
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,098
There are many advantages 
to aerial flying. 

48
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:56,905
It is a reliable method 
that can be implemented rapidly.

49
00:02:57,094 --> 00:03:02,894
It  mobilizes few staff members 
and allows to cover large surfaces.

50
00:03:03,138 --> 00:03:05,451
Thanks to aerial flying, 
you can access 

51
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:07,704
usually, non-paroled territories

52
00:03:07,893 --> 00:03:12,156
and easily get a lot 
of geo-specific information.

53
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:16,301
This method is limited 
by the state of the area 

54
00:03:16,474 --> 00:03:20,136
that shouldn't be too close, 
and also by some spaces 

55
00:03:20,366 --> 00:03:22,353
that are being looked for. 

56
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,375
Some of them are difficult
to detect 

57
00:03:24,623 --> 00:03:27,323
because they live in the forest, 
so we cannot see them,

58
00:03:27,558 --> 00:03:31,095
or form uncountable herds
like the baboons for instance 

59
00:03:31,298 --> 00:03:34,598
or because they don't run away
as the aircraft gets closer, 

60
00:03:34,815 --> 00:03:37,702
so it's difficult to see them 
and they're difficult to spot,

61
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:39,509
like the eland for instance. 

62
00:03:39,770 --> 00:03:41,620
The one we see there. 

63
00:03:41,958 --> 00:03:44,608
Aerials have an income also, 
of course, 

64
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:49,995
be costly, even though, this fact
needs to be put  into perspective

65
00:03:50,175 --> 00:03:54,975
compared to other method
and quality of obtaining results. 

66
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:57,616
Aerials surveying is done
by transects,

67
00:03:57,817 --> 00:04:01,117
usually parallel lines fall 
by the aircraft. 

68
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,305
Most of the times several transects 
are covered during  flights

69
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:10,898
and they are  oriented in a way
to avoid having to face the same.

70
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:16,982
Generally speaking, the overflight
takes place early in the morning 

71
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:20,269
or in the late afternoon, 

72
00:04:20,513 --> 00:04:23,063
to avoid the hot hours 
of the day. 

73
00:04:23,244 --> 00:04:26,032
Animals are counted (INAUDIBLE)
on the ground

74
00:04:26,196 --> 00:04:29,359
that were calibrated on the plane
during the preparation phase

75
00:04:29,563 --> 00:04:31,075
of the protocol. 

76
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:34,905
Aerial counts are made 
thanks to high-wind aircraft

77
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:37,306
for better visibility on the ground.

78
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:40,184
The surveying team usually 
gathers four people

79
00:04:40,385 --> 00:04:43,597
including the pilot 
who follows the flight plan, 

80
00:04:43,835 --> 00:04:47,373
the navigator will record 
the information given 

81
00:04:47,579 --> 00:04:50,754
by the observers and controls
the flight parameters

82
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:54,180
and, two observers 
at the back, 

83
00:04:54,432 --> 00:04:57,432
in charge of detecting the follow. 

84
00:04:58,010 --> 00:05:01,273
The pilot, as this one, 
and the navigator, 

85
00:05:01,505 --> 00:05:04,855
can also contribute to the survey
by supporting the main observer,

86
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:08,561
and the GPS will be programmed
with all the transects 

87
00:05:08,748 --> 00:05:10,436
before off. 

88
00:05:10,656 --> 00:05:13,056
Sampling is the best way 
to proceed 

89
00:05:13,276 --> 00:05:16,564
to aerial survey, because 
if you do the total count,  

90
00:05:16,758 --> 00:05:20,421
there is a high risk of recounting 
moving animals especially 

91
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:24,950
when using several aircraft 
launched at the same time. 

92
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:29,601
The first step consist in defining 
a path on each side of the plane,

93
00:05:29,836 --> 00:05:33,286
generally between 100 
and 250 meters large 

94
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:35,663
according to visibility 
you will have. 

95
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:38,668
You then calibrate the plane 
thanks to the banner 

96
00:05:38,842 --> 00:05:42,830
that are attached to the the spars 
to define the path on the ground. 

97
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:46,852
The interval between transects 
then depends 

98
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:50,923
on the desired sampling rate
you will wish to obtain.

99
00:05:51,481 --> 00:05:54,631
During the overflights, 
only the animals within the path

100
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:59,404
are to go into account which allows
to calculate a theoretical density

101
00:05:59,622 --> 00:06:03,622
along with a standard deviation 
that is of greater magnitude

102
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:07,021
when there are fewer contact points 
an when the counting effort 

103
00:06:07,221 --> 00:06:08,709
is reduced. 

104
00:06:09,304 --> 00:06:12,629
The sampling method requires 
simple statistical processing 

105
00:06:12,862 --> 00:06:17,099
of data, following the Jolly method
most of the time, 

106
00:06:17,295 --> 00:06:19,420
this is explained in the 
second module 

107
00:06:19,606 --> 00:06:22,418
about statistics in this MOOC.

108
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,414
The count usually covers 
10 to 20 % of the territory 

109
00:06:27,642 --> 00:06:31,292
and the results can greatly vary 
from one season to another.

110
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:35,723
In order not to disrupt the flight, 
big herds are usually photographed

111
00:06:35,935 --> 00:06:38,435
for subsequent counting. 

112
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:42,360
Finally, using a geographical 
information system, 

113
00:06:42,592 --> 00:06:45,417
allows to determine 
the distribution of animals 

114
00:06:45,663 --> 00:06:47,463
within the protected area 

115
00:06:47,697 --> 00:06:51,922
if the GPS positions of the 
observations are properly recorded.

116
00:06:52,627 --> 00:06:55,540
Sources of aerial are due 
to the sampling rate.

117
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:59,473
The more transects there are, 
and the wider paths are, 

118
00:06:59,722 --> 00:07:01,884
the more ground is covered 
and therefore, 

119
00:07:02,068 --> 00:07:04,630
the position of the survey improves.

120
00:07:04,845 --> 00:07:08,107
Some species will systematically
be underestimated 

121
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:11,102
because  they're hardly visible
from the plane 

122
00:07:11,331 --> 00:07:13,806
like this lion for example.

123
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:16,848
For bigger herds, you need 
you need to force yourself 

124
00:07:17,082 --> 00:07:21,944
to count only the animals 
present inside counting path. 

125
00:07:22,651 --> 00:07:25,889
The meteorological conditions 
and visibility 

126
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:29,124
can also greatly affect 
the counting performance.

127
00:07:29,963 --> 00:07:33,850
The experience of a people 
is essential to avoid 

128
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:37,286
identification.mistakes 
and to quickly being able

129
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:40,546
to estimate the number
of animal present. 

130
00:07:40,732 --> 00:07:43,319
You also need 
to take into account that 

131
00:07:43,518 --> 00:07:47,305
tiredness greatly affects attention 
after a while. 

132
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:51,562
Of course, you would need test
of the ability of the observers 

133
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:56,905
to fly  without getting sick
in often harsh conditions.

134
00:07:57,550 --> 00:07:59,887
Finally, since it's a low 
level flight

135
00:08:00,124 --> 00:08:02,011
in a quite hostile environment, 

136
00:08:02,186 --> 00:08:04,023
you need to have a prepared team

137
00:08:04,146 --> 00:08:06,084
to the possibility 
of an engine failure, 

138
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:08,448
that will lead into 
an emergency landing. 

139
00:08:08,675 --> 00:08:10,275
Good luck.
