Hello.
Indirect mammal monitoring methods

2
00:00:12,439 --> 00:00:16,828
are used when the animals
themselves are difficult to observe.

3
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:22,462
When vegetation is dense, as it is 
the case in forests, for example.

4
00:00:22,662 --> 00:00:26,418
When animals are present
in low density, 

5
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:31,992
or when a species tends to appear
scarcely in the open.

6
00:00:32,498 --> 00:00:37,553
Indirect counting approaches
are usually based on

7
00:00:37,765 --> 00:00:40,797
sampling techniques we already
talked about

8
00:00:40,997 --> 00:00:43,154
in the indirect monitoring. 

9
00:00:43,383 --> 00:00:49,664
And so (INAUDIBLE) use sampling units,
such as the quadrats

10
00:00:49,893 --> 00:00:52,294
you are familiar with now.

11
00:00:53,738 --> 00:00:57,225
Of course, line transects 
can also be used.

12
00:00:57,425 --> 00:01:00,375
They are axis of progression
along which

13
00:01:00,575 --> 00:01:03,734
the indicators are counted.

14
00:01:05,017 --> 00:01:08,601
Belt transects can also be used.

15
00:01:08,801 --> 00:01:13,333
They are based on 
the same principle,

16
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:20,231
but the counting is done
over determined surface

17
00:01:20,431 --> 00:01:24,697
on both sides 
of the progression axis.

18
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:29,327
There are several indirect 
inventory methods

19
00:01:29,527 --> 00:01:33,060
depending on the species
that is being studied,

20
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:36,225
on the environment's physical
characteristics,

21
00:01:36,425 --> 00:01:39,138
on indicators that 
are being measured,

22
00:01:39,338 --> 00:01:41,691
and the resources at hand.

23
00:01:42,528 --> 00:01:44,966
What we are looking for 
in that case, remember, 

24
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:51,084
are signs or indicators 
of the animal's presence. 

25
00:01:52,022 --> 00:01:55,778
And to measure,
to monitor large African mammals,

26
00:01:55,978 --> 00:02:02,180
the most commonly used methods
are as follows.

27
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:08,108
These are monitoring footprints,
monitoring tracks,

28
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:12,593
monitoring dens and burrows,
and nests,

29
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,020
monitoring faeces,

30
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,625
and monitoring family
noises or calls,

31
00:02:21,825 --> 00:02:24,292
especially when monitoring lions.

32
00:02:25,325 --> 00:02:26,871
Okay, let's see that in detail.

33
00:02:27,105 --> 00:02:31,946
The footprint counting methods
can be used when the substrate

34
00:02:32,146 --> 00:02:36,109
allows it, and it is a case
in sandy regions, for example.

35
00:02:36,364 --> 00:02:40,922
Monitoring footprints can 
be done daily, at any time you want, 

36
00:02:41,122 --> 00:02:44,588
but at each passage, do not forget
to cover 

37
00:02:44,788 --> 00:02:49,089
the signs that have already 
been recorded, of course.

38
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,255
And the analysis of footprints,
helps to estimate

39
00:02:54,455 --> 00:02:59,163
the walking direction,
and the use of the habitat,

40
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:04,002
as well as the size, the gender,
and even at times, 

41
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,973
the age of the individuals. 

42
00:03:07,173 --> 00:03:09,929
An estimation of 
the population density

43
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:13,630
can then be done by 
a simple formula, 

44
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,110
combining the density of
the tracks recorded

45
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,353
and the average size
of the considered species' habitat.

46
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:27,668
The tracks recognition methods
helps in some cases

47
00:03:27,868 --> 00:03:31,435
to recognize an animal,
and to monitor it.

48
00:03:31,717 --> 00:03:36,730
Recognition can be done
by sampling scars,

49
00:03:37,193 --> 00:03:41,680
sizes, missing claws, etc.

50
00:03:41,978 --> 00:03:45,673
For example, this technique 
has been used

51
00:03:45,873 --> 00:03:50,221
to monitor leopards
in the Namibian desert. 

52
00:03:51,258 --> 00:03:54,294
It can also be used
for the individual

53
00:03:54,494 --> 00:03:56,024
monitoring of elephants.

54
00:03:56,882 --> 00:03:58,712
Yeah, it's often 
used for elephants.

55
00:03:58,912 --> 00:04:01,748
The footprints of a species
can vary

56
00:04:01,948 --> 00:04:05,604
depending on if they are front
or back paws, for example.

57
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,278
Depending on the age,
the gender of the animal.

58
00:04:09,478 --> 00:04:12,885
It is therefore advised to combine
direct observation

59
00:04:13,085 --> 00:04:14,694
of the animal and it's tracks.

60
00:04:14,894 --> 00:04:18,863
Ideally, in each region,
it is recommended to set

61
00:04:19,063 --> 00:04:22,589
a baseline collection using 
plaster moulds,

62
00:04:22,789 --> 00:04:25,498
or 3D photographs.

63
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:30,818
Yes, and counting burrows and dens,
consist in monitoring

64
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,431
animal resting
or reproductive sites.

65
00:04:35,981 --> 00:04:39,456
It isn't always easy,
because the number of

66
00:04:39,656 --> 00:04:43,265
individuals in the burrows
may vary.

67
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:48,000
They maybe abandoned
or occupied by another species.

68
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:52,436
For example,  aardvark burrows
can be occupied

69
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,600
by wart hogs, hyenas, 
mongooses, etc.

70
00:04:57,876 --> 00:05:00,536
Lots of species.
On the field this method

71
00:05:00,736 --> 00:05:03,038
consists in distinguishing
the number of 

72
00:05:03,238 --> 00:05:07,121
abandoned burrows occupied by
the studied species,

73
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:10,905
occupied by other species,
as well as the number

74
00:05:11,105 --> 00:05:14,425
of individuals per
occupied burrows.

75
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,848
To clarify this question,
it is advised

76
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:20,652
to combine this technique
with the identification

77
00:05:20,852 --> 00:05:23,567
of tracks at the burrow entrance.

78
00:05:23,971 --> 00:05:28,637
As the faeces monitoring method
is commonly used

79
00:05:28,837 --> 00:05:31,994
when monitoring elephants,
it consists

80
00:05:32,194 --> 00:05:35,397
in counting all the dung heaps
or dung piles

81
00:05:35,597 --> 00:05:40,345
in the sampling area where
units are often made

82
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:44,561
or quadrats or again,
transects we have talked about.

83
00:05:44,761 --> 00:05:47,400
Yeah.
Each elephant dung

84
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,155
is classified in one of 
the five age categories

85
00:05:50,354 --> 00:05:53,760
defined by specialists
going from very fresh

86
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,628
to almost completely decomposed.

87
00:05:57,300 --> 00:06:00,735
And only relatively fresh
dung piles

88
00:06:00,935 --> 00:06:04,713
are to be considered in 
the mathematical estimate

89
00:06:04,938 --> 00:06:07,126
of dung densities.

90
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:11,572
Thereby, droppings that are
too decomposed

91
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:15,395
are considered to have disappeared.

92
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,913
There is a relatively simple
relation between

93
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:23,218
the elephant density, E,
the number of dungs

94
00:06:23,418 --> 00:06:29,995
produced by elephant per day,
Y, the dung decomposition rate,

95
00:06:30,195 --> 00:06:34,131
or (INAUDIBLE) the dung density, D.

96
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:36,814
This gives an estimation
of the number

97
00:06:37,014 --> 00:06:39,356
of elephants present
in the zone.

98
00:06:40,146 --> 00:06:45,820
And the nest counting method
is very much used

99
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:49,049
when monitoring certain primates.

100
00:06:49,249 --> 00:06:52,685
(INAUDIBLE) will share more about that 
.with you

101
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:58,438
It consists in counting the nest
in the sampling area

102
00:06:58,638 --> 00:07:04,126
where the units again, are often
quadrats or transects.

103
00:07:04,985 --> 00:07:08,445
There is a relation between 
the nest density

104
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:11,775
and the average size 
of the nest groups.

105
00:07:11,975 --> 00:07:15,435
The nest degradation speed, v,
and the density

106
00:07:15,628 --> 00:07:19,374
or (INAUDIBLE) if you work on (INAUDIBLE), C.

107
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:25,774
The method using sounds or calls
is essentially used

108
00:07:25,999 --> 00:07:27,574
when monitoring lions. 

109
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:34,038
It consists in recording
the sound at set point

110
00:07:34,238 --> 00:07:38,001
separated by a minimal interval of
13 kilometers,

111
00:07:38,201 --> 00:07:41,843
in order not to recount
the same animals.

112
00:07:42,043 --> 00:07:46,450
In this way you obtain
an estimate of the minimal

113
00:07:46,650 --> 00:07:50,084
number of lions on
the survey sites.

114
00:07:50,284 --> 00:07:53,879
Finally, you can also use
sensors and captors

115
00:07:54,129 --> 00:07:56,806
to detect indirectly the animals.

116
00:07:57,006 --> 00:08:00,292
It could be acoustic sensor
or camera trap

117
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:05,611
that takes pictures of or make 
movies as we have already seen.

118
00:08:05,811 --> 00:08:11,126
That way you can follow the animals
species of your path

119
00:08:11,326 --> 00:08:15,033
without having to be on the ground,
especially when

120
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:18,906
your cameras are connected
so that you can 

121
00:08:19,106 --> 00:08:21,362
download the data from your office.

122
00:08:21,562 --> 00:08:25,058
And then you enter 
the Internet of Things.
