00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:09,639
Welcome to this course entitled introduction
to public health engineering in humanitarian 

2
00:00:09,639 --> 00:00:11,019
context.

3
00:00:11,019 --> 00:00:15,260
My name is Christoph Lüthi and I work for
the Swiss Federal Institute of aquatic science

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:22,190
and technology, EAWAG, and I am responsible for Sandec,
the department of sanitation water and solid waste

5
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:25,020
for development.

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:30,200
I am Javier Cordoba and I am working for the
water and habitat training of the international

7
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:31,470
committee of the Red Cross.

8
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:38,260
A one hundred fifty years old humanitarian
organization whose mandate is to ensure humanitarian

9
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:46,130
protection and assistance for victims of armed
conflicts and other situations of violence.

10
00:00:46,130 --> 00:00:50,950
The world is facing unprecedented humanitarian
needs; we are witnessing an increase in the number

11
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:57,980
of humanitarian crises that tend to be more
and more complex and often in urban settings,

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,449
longer in duration and broader in regional
impact.

13
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:10,630
These humanitarian crises cause intense sufferings,
disrupt essential services and put populations

14
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:14,189
at greater risk of infectious diseases.

15
00:01:14,189 --> 00:01:19,479
In order to respond to these challenges and
growing needs, well trained engineers and

16
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:26,409
specialists in water sanitation, energy supply,
environment and in other related fields

17
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,179
are increasingly needed.

18
00:01:29,179 --> 00:01:34,560
This is why the ICRC and EAWAG have
decided to combine their expertise and experience

19
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:39,630
to deliver this MOOC which explores the field
of public health engineering in the specific

20
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,740
context of humanitarian crisis caused by armed
conflicts.

21
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,649
We have designed this course for a broad audience.

22
00:01:47,649 --> 00:01:53,099
The main requirement for this course is to
be curious and excited to know more about

23
00:01:53,099 --> 00:01:56,380
humanitarian engagement and engineering.

24
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:02,189
You might be a student, a professional or
a practitioner already working in the humanitarian

25
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,270
sector.

26
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:08,750
Our wish is that at the end of the course
you will be willing to use your engineering

27
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:13,840
and technical skills to contribute to the
humanitarian efforts that is so much needed

28
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,939
in today’s world.

29
00:02:14,939 --> 00:02:20,319
Let’s have a look at the learning objectives
of this five-week course.

30
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:26,780
After this course, we would like you to understand
the link between water, sanitation and hygiene,

31
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:33,989
so-called wash activities and health in order
to identify key measures to be taken to reduce

32
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:40,599
the mortality and morbidity due to infectious
diseases encountered in humanitarian contexts.

33
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:45,719
Besides the public health aspect, we would
like you also to get familiar with the features

34
00:02:45,719 --> 00:02:52,140
of humanitarian response, particularly with
the challenges posed by essential services

35
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:59,269
such as water supply, sanitation or electricity
during protracted armed conflicts.

36
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:04,450
Finally in order to be able to define the
outline of the humanitarian response in public

37
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:09,769
health engineering sector, you should be able
to know the main technologies encountered

38
00:03:09,769 --> 00:03:12,969
in the humanitarian contexts.

39
00:03:12,969 --> 00:03:17,930
This course consists of video lectures given
by ICRC experts and EAWAG researchers,

40
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,440
bringing together years of research and field
experience.

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,690
In addition we have included a selection of
videos from EWAG MOOC series, sanitation,

42
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:31,370
water and solid waste for development which
were relevant to the topic of this MOOC.

43
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:36,150
If you would like to learn more on the series
please visit our website.

44
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:41,709
Finally, in order for you to get an understanding
of reality on the ground this MOOC contains

45
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,909
real case studies and situations faced by
ICRC engineers in the field.

46
00:03:47,909 --> 00:03:52,900
Let's take a closer look to the syllabus of
this course.

47
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,480
In week one, we will introduce you to the
topic of public health engineering and see

48
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:03,510
how engineers can have a significant impact
to reduce the mortality and morbidity encountering

49
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:06,239
many humanitarian contexts.

50
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:11,599
In order to do so, engineers should have a
good understanding on how infectious diseases

51
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,900
are transmitted.

52
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:19,530
A case study on plague eradication campaign
in Madagascar will illustrate the topic of

53
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:21,919
this week.

54
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,440
In week two, we will present the humanitarian
contexts in which public health engineering

55
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,910
activities take place.

56
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:33,819
We will see how protracted conflicts affect
urban essential services such as the water

57
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:37,870
supply or sanitation, resulting in public health
issues.

58
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,139
A case study on Iraq will illustrate this
challenge.

59
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:47,169
Week three reviews water technologies commonly
used from the source to the distribution point

60
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:49,360
in order to provide water.

61
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,169
This week will be based mainly on the water
technology compendium currently being developed

62
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,979
by some Swiss researchers.

63
00:04:55,979 --> 00:05:03,650
Some ICRC case studies dealing with water
supply in emergencies will also be presented.

64
00:05:03,650 --> 00:05:08,970
Week four then presents a sanitation compendium
developed by EAWAG that will be illustrated

65
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:16,580
with ICRC case studies related to sanitation
challenges in humanitarian context.

66
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:21,460
In the last week, we will focus on a type
of solid waste that pubic health engineers

67
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:25,710
often encounter in humanitarian crisis: medical
waste.

68
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:32,259
Finally, we will discuss the critical issue
of behaviour change in emergencies and hygiene

69
00:05:32,259 --> 00:05:33,539
promotion.

70
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:37,979
Given the time available, this course will
not be able to provide you with a wide range

71
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:41,160
of details on the different aspects presented.

72
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:47,169
Our goal is to introduce you to the topics
and provide a general overview.

73
00:05:47,169 --> 00:05:53,210
This is why for each week you will be referred
to ICRC and EAWAG publications available

74
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,200
for free on the internet and the course platform.

75
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:04,419
In addition, we will also refer you to publications
from other organizations.

76
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:10,419
On behalf of all of the lecturers,
have fun learning this MOOC!

77
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:12,300
We are looking forward to working
with you over the coming weeks.

78
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,570
Let's start the course!
