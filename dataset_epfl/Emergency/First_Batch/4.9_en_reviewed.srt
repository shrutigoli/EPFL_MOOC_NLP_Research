1
00:00:23,673 --> 00:00:30,028
The main problem in the kitchen is
the lack of firewood.

2
00:00:30,028 --> 00:00:32,278
Sometimes our stock is damp from the rain

3
00:00:32,278 --> 00:00:35,800
sometimes it simply runs out.

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,270
Damp firewood means longer cooking times
because we can't get it to light.

5
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,960
Below this cover,
there's a pit six or seven meters deep,

6
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,960
shaped like a dome.

7
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:04,489
It's in there that the excrement
breaks down and produces gas

8
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:08,400
The gas then collects at the top.

9
00:01:15,514 --> 00:01:17,217
When we cook with firewood,

10
00:01:17,217 --> 00:01:18,520
the smoke is awful.

11
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:22,280
It stings our eyes.

12
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:25,980
But with gas, there's no smoke.
It's much nicer.

13
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,490
Cooking times are shorter

14
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:32,100
because food cooks more quickly.

15
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:34,540
It's much faster with gas.
