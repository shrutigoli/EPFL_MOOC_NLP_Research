00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,980
Well done, you made it through the first week
of this course.

2
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,700
During this week, we have seen that communicable
diseases such as diarrheal diseases and malaria

3
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:18,220
are a major cause of mortality and morbidity
in humanitarian contexts.

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:24,330
Context where the populations particularly
at risk, due to various factors such as stress,

5
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:30,610
malnutrition, overcrowding, poor housing and
unsanitary conditions.

6
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:37,700
In order to tackle these diseases, it is crucial
to involve various disciplines and specialists.

7
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:44,030
This multidisciplinary approach is conceptualised
in the model of pyramid of health.

8
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:48,530
In this model, engineers play an important
role to stop the transmission of hazards in

9
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:55,820
their environment through the provision of
adequate drinking water supply, proper excreta management

10
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:02,820
runoff and waste water disposal, collection and disposal of
refuse and effective vector control interventions.

11
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:09,159
Public health engineering measures focus on
putting multiple barriers to prevent the creation of

12
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,229
hazards,

13
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:15,899
its transport and the people from being exposed to it
once encountered.

14
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:21,350
In order to do so, public ealth engineers
should have a good understanding of the environmental

15
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:25,380
transmission pathways of the diseases.

16
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:30,009
Such understanding helps to put the appropriate
barriers at the right time and at the right

17
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:31,009
place.

18
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:36,520
For instance remember that faecal oral diseases
we have seen with the F-diagram the importance

19
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,329
of having adequate sanitation measures,
proper hygiene practices and adequate quantity

20
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:45,850
and quality of water to ensure health benefits.

21
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:52,020
I hope you enjoyed this first week and
stay on board with us for the next week to

22
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:57,459
continue to learn how to respond to the needs
of people affected by humanitarian crises. See you!
