00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,850
Vectors are animals that are capable of carrying
disease pathogens from a reservoir, an animal,

2
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:14,760
a human or an environment to another host.

3
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,910
They are a major cause of sickness and death
in many humanitarian contexts.

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:28,930
In addition to transmitting diseases, some
vector may also be considered as a nuisance

5
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:36,579
because of the painful bite or due to the
large number. Sorry!

6
00:00:36,579 --> 00:00:41,379
The objectives of this lecture is for you to
understand the transmission mechanism of diseases

7
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:43,819
through vectors,

8
00:00:43,819 --> 00:00:49,969
know the main vectors commonly encountered
in emergencies and their related diseases,

9
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:53,469
understand the outlines of vector control
strategies.

10
00:00:53,469 --> 00:01:00,739
A vector carries and transmits infectious
pathogens from a reservoir to another host.

11
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:05,590
The reservoir can be an animal or human or
the environment on which infectious agent

12
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:07,920
depends to survive.

13
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,740
The pathogen can be transmitted mechanically
to another host.

14
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:17,410
It means that the vector transmits the pathogens
by transporting them on its body.

15
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:23,960
Let’s take an example: a fly landing on
faeces with pathogens will then transmit this

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:31,860
pathogen to the human by landing on its side
or in the salad that the person is eating.

17
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,590
The pathogen can also be transmitted after
a biological transformation.

18
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:42,240
In that case, the vector is involved in the life
cycle of the pathogen which matures through

19
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,450
the vector such as the malaria.

20
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,971
In the transmission of vector-borne diseases,
infection can occur via biting, which for

21
00:01:51,971 --> 00:01:57,470
instance, the malaria transmitting mosquitoes
or via skin penetration for instance, for

22
00:01:57,470 --> 00:02:04,740
the scabies transmitting mites or ingestion,
food contamination by flies for instance.

23
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,950
In humanitarian context, displaced population
are particularly at risk of vector transmitted

24
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:14,660
diseases. Indeed the stress, the lack of good
nutrition and lack of previous exposure to

25
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:20,270
diseases are factors affecting the populations’
immunity to vector-borne diseases.

26
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:25,500
Overcrowding makes it easier for some vector
to spread diseases from person to person.

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:29,920
This is particularly the case for instance
for lice and mites.

28
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,570
Poor housing increases as well the risk to vector
exposure and poor drainage, poor solid waste

29
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:40,680
or poor sanitation management increase the
risk of having vectors.

30
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,640
The area that host displaced population can
also be an area that supports a significant

31
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:51,870
vector population and protracted conflicts
can also affect the capacity of authorities

32
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,020
to carry out traditional vector control measures
that used to be done in the past.

33
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:03,459
In order to minimize morbidity and mortality
due to vector-borne diseases, vector control

34
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:09,430
measures should be taken in epidemic zones, in
epidemic-prone contexts or wherever

35
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,670
there is a high presence of the vector.

36
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:18,760
Vector control strategies usually aim at reducing
vector breeding sites, reducing vector population

37
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,870
density or in order to reduce the risk of
human vector contacts.

38
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:29,810
In other words, reducing the creation of the
hazards, its transport and the exposure of

39
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:32,520
people to the hazard.

40
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:38,920
The vector control strategies may be classified
in four types: environmental control,

41
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,510
in order to alter breeding sites such as
draining or filling sites or also ensuring 

42
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:45,160
a proper waste management.

43
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:50,980
There is also the mechanical control, for instance
using nets against mosquitoes, covering food

44
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:56,200
against flies or using traps to catch rodents.

45
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:01,620
The biological management which consists of using
living organisms or products against a different form

46
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:02,710
of the vector.

47
00:04:02,710 --> 00:04:07,750
A typical example is the use of fish that
eat larvas for instance.

48
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:13,209
Finally, the chemical control for personal
protection such as sprays used as a mosquito

49
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:17,299
repellent or insecticides for
environmental control.

50
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:24,140
However, it is usually recommended to use
insecticides as the last resort.

51
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:29,420
Indeed it is much more efficient and effective
and less costly to collect and remove refuse

52
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:37,550
regularly than to depend upon insecticides
to combat flies or rat poison to limit rodents.

53
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:42,400
In addition, while using the pesticides it
is very important to ensure that the staff,

54
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:48,210
the communities and the local environment
are adequately protected and of course avoid

55
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:54,449
creating chemical resistance to
the substance used.

56
00:04:54,449 --> 00:04:59,220
In summary in order to take effective actions
against a vector it is crucial to be familiar

57
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,870
with the vector life and its habitat.

58
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:11,430
The following table lists some common vectors
of diseases encountered in humanitarian contexts.

59
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,910
Mosquitoes with three main species responsible
for transmitting diseases.

60
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:23,230
The anopheles which breed in rather unpolluted
water such as pot holes or wells and which

61
00:05:23,230 --> 00:05:26,080
transmit malaria.

62
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:32,690
The aedes which tend to breed in water receptacles
such as bottles or buckets and which transmit

63
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:35,250
yellow fever and dengue.

64
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,930
The culex which breed in second water loaded
with organic matter such as in latrines and

65
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:45,300
transmit filariasis.

66
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:51,050
Flies proliferate in old places where human
beings are living. They feed on decomposing

67
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:54,000
organic matter, excreta and fruits.

68
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,510
They play an important role in the transmission
of diarrheal diseases.

69
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,180
Actions against house flies include limit or
eliminate breeding sites, typically collect

70
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:10,330
refuse, improve compost heaps, protect latrines,
improve drainage.

71
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:17,410
In addition, sources of attraction should
be reduced and food well protected with lids.

72
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:22,120
Lice are found on hair and clothing, they
can transmit typhus which is fatal to ten

73
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:28,669
to forty per cent of untreated patients as
well as relating fever.

74
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:35,580
Actions against lice include improving general
hygiene, wash clothing and blankets and treating

75
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:39,639
all people with an insecticide boulder.

76
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:43,650
Fleas feed on the blood of mammals and birds.

77
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:47,300
They are found in beds, in the ground and
in clothing.

78
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:56,460
The rat flea is responsible for bubonic
plague and murine typhus.

79
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,430
Bed bugs do not transmit any diseases but
they nevertheless constitute a considerable

80
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:05,150
nuisance because they feed on blood.

81
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:11,020
They hide in cracks, in walls or wood and
also in bedding.

82
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:14,650
Insecticide is required to eliminate them.

83
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:19,670
As we have seen vector control diseases
are a major cause of sickness and death in

84
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:24,360
many humanitarian crises where population
are particularly at risk.

85
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:28,440
In order to reduce the transmission of these
specific diseases, it is very important to

86
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,520
know the life cycle of vectors and its habitat
in order to take effective measures at the

87
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,699
right time and at the right place.

88
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:42,490
For instance, if body lice, the vector of typhus,
have to be eliminated, they have to be attacked

89
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:44,740
on the body or on the clothing.

90
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,199
It is pointless to spray surfaces with the
residual insecticide.

91
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:55,550
But on the other hand to control bed bugs
and other crawly insects such as cockroaches

92
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:01,699
and flies, spraying walls or the furniture
and the floor is an effective measure because

93
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:05,639
these insects rest on such surfaces after
feeding.

94
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:11,020
However, remember that the use of chemicals
to control vectors is not necessarily the best

95
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,020
options.

96
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:19,770
Mechanical, environmental or biology measures
may be much more appropriate and efficient.

97
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:25,020
So in order to design a proper vector control
measure, a detailed study on the vector and

98
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:30,289
often expert advice are needed and should
be sought from national and international

99
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:32,620
health organizations.

100
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:35,569
Let's have a look now at a concrete example.

101
00:08:35,569 --> 00:08:40,630
In the next video we will see the control
campaign carried out by the ICRC in Madagascar

102
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:45,060
prisons in collaboration with local authorities
and the pastor institutes.
