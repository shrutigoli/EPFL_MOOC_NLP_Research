00:00:04,230 --> 00:00:06,970
Welcome to the second week
of this introduction

2
00:00:06,970 --> 00:00:10,960
on Public health engineering
in humanitarian context.

3
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:11,991
Last week,

4
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:14,720
we have learned the principle
of Public health engineering

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,060
and see how water, sanitation,
hygiene promotion

6
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,900
and vector control activities

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,990
can have of significant impact
to reduce the morbidity

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:28,520
and mortality during a humanitarian 
crisis.

9
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:33,814
This week, we shift our focus on
the humanitarian context itself.

10
00:00:33,814 --> 00:00:38,254
We would like you to get familiar
with your humanitarian environment

11
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:40,280
and its new challenges,

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,760
especially the one who leaked it 
to humanitarian response

13
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:49,000
in urban settings during protracted
conflict.

14
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,500
In these video on the introduction
of humanitarian context,

15
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,250
you will learn to describe different
phases of humanitarian crisis

16
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:00,480
in order to understand the scope of
intervention needed accordingly.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,490
We will also talk briefly about the main
stakeholders in the humanitarian system.

18
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:12,960
And finally we will discuss
the humanitarian principles and norms.

19
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,730
There are different types of disaster.

20
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:18,510
Some of them can be natural
with the sudden impact

21
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:21,250
such as the earthquake, tsunami;

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,760
or with the slow unset;
such as drought or famine.

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,244
Some disaster can also be man-made

24
00:01:28,244 --> 00:01:30,750
such as with armed conflict.

25
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,300
and that will be the main focus
of this course.

26
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:38,970
Disasters interrupts the normal function
of a community or society

27
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:42,937
and cause loss of life and damage
to property and infrastructure

28
00:01:42,937 --> 00:01:45,757
that exceed the community's ability

29
00:01:45,757 --> 00:01:49,260
to cope using its own resources.

30
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:51,750
When essential needs to sustain life

31
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:56,730
such as water, food, health care,
shelter are likely not to be met,

32
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:59,231
action is required to save life;

33
00:01:59,231 --> 00:02:03,040
prevent further losses and minimize risk.

34
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:08,470
This is what is done by humanitarian
action during a crisis.

35
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:10,755
Every humanitarian crises

36
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:13,750
has its own dynamic and evolution.

37
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,180
But traditionally,

38
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:21,950
humanitarian crises are schematized
into four main phases.

39
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:24,980
A pre-crisis where essential
needs are met;

40
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:28,960
but a risk exists that the situation
will deteriorate.

41
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:33,530
Therefore, preparedness measures
are sometimes taken.

42
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,746
Once a disaster occurs,

43
00:02:35,746 --> 00:02:38,790
we enter into the acute crisis phase

44
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:42,460
where essential needs are not met any more.

45
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,460
During this phase,

46
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:45,996
there is a peak of search and
rescue activities

47
00:02:45,996 --> 00:02:48,773
in the immediate aftermath of a disaster,

48
00:02:48,773 --> 00:02:51,780
followed by emergency relief activities

49
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,270
aiming at stabilizing the survivors
physical and emotional condition.

50
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,750
The Primary focus is on life saving
activities

51
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,270
and the overall fifty community health
status.

52
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:12,520
This phase can take typically between
one to six months.

53
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:14,746
After we enter into a longer phase

54
00:03:14,746 --> 00:03:18,276
which is the recovery phase.

55
00:03:18,276 --> 00:03:20,760
The focus is on the rehabilitation
and reconstruction

56
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,790
to restore the level existing
before the crisis.

57
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,003
And finally, we enter into
the post-crises

58
00:03:29,003 --> 00:03:32,740
where development activities take place. //

59
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,520
However,

60
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,530
nowadays, we see a complexification
of these traditional model

61
00:03:38,530 --> 00:03:42,310
with a growing number of chronic crisis.

62
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,950
Instead of having an accurate crisis 
followed by a recovery phase,

63
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:51,190
there is a succession of ups and downs
over several years;

64
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,780
even decades.

65
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,230
Essential needs are not completely met.

66
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:01,770
and there is a high risk that 
the situation will return to acute crisis.

67
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:06,270
This is often due to protracted 
conflict that lasts for many years

68
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:11,510
and that are currently a 
major driver of humanitarian needs.

69
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:14,770
As a result of the increase of protacted
conflicts,

70
00:04:14,770 --> 00:04:18,770
there is also higher probability of multiple
disasters,

71
00:04:18,770 --> 00:04:20,760
natural and manmade,

72
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:23,530
occuring of the same time.

73
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:25,250
In such complex context,

74
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,510
the border between humanitarian action
and development activities

75
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:32,230
is getting very blurred.

76
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,750
In addition to the traditional emergency relief,

77
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:41,990
humanitarian organization have to respond 
to the long term effect of conflicts.

78
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,500
It leads many organizations

79
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,990
to have to play beyond their traditional roles
and capacities

80
00:04:46,990 --> 00:04:52,960
in order to meet the needs of people
affected by current humanitarian crisis.

81
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,910
In the humanitarian system,

82
00:04:54,910 --> 00:04:55,970
they are also entities

83
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:59,500
which the primary mandate is to provide
humanitarian assistance

84
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:02,790
such as the United Nations
humanitarian agency,

85
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,960
International Red Cross and
Red Crescent movement

86
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:12,280
or national and local agencies with 
responsibilities for crisis response.

87
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,960
There may be also other actors

88
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:17,520
that play a critical role in humanitarian
response

89
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,490
such as the private sector entities
or diaspora.

90
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:22,960
In an ideal world,

91
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,224
all these actors should work in 
good coordination.

92
00:05:26,224 --> 00:05:29,200
but it is not always the case.

93
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,260
Now let's focus on this humanitarian actor :

94
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:36,300
the International Red Cross and
Red Crescent movement.

95
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:39,750
It is a global humanitarian network
of eighty million people

96
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:45,790
that helps those facing disaster, conflict,
health and social problems.

97
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:48,950
It consists of three main components:

98
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:51,515
The International Committee
of the Red Cross,

99
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:56,260
the International Federation
of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.

100
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:03,550
And the 190 National Red Cross
and Red Crescent Societies.

101
00:06:03,550 --> 00:06:08,250
Each component of the movement has
its own legal identity on the role.

102
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,970
but they are all united by seven 
fundamental principles

103
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,230
of the International Red Cross
and Red Crescent movement

104
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:18,220
that guide their humanitarian action.

105
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:22,250
The seven fundamental principles
sum up the movement ethics

106
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:23,957
and are at the core of its approach

107
00:06:23,957 --> 00:06:26,780
to helping people in need during
armed conflict,

108
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,850
natural disaster and other emergencies.

109
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,990
The first four principles:

110
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:36,750
humanity, impartiality, neutrality
and independence,

111
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:40,240
have been enshrined in United Nations
resolutions

112
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,790
in state commitments and in pledges
from numerous aid agencies,

113
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:50,520
making them a relying force in
the humanitarian community and beyond.

114
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:51,950
Another set of principles

115
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:56,480
that most humanitarian action
agreed to develop in the nineties,

116
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:58,960
is the sphere project.

117
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,740
We have already seen it last week;

118
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,700
Remember; it contains the minimum
standards of core humanitarian assistance

119
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,250
such as food security and nutrition,

120
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:14,790
health, shelter and water supplies
sanitation and hygiene promotion.

121
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:18,260
Its aim is to help improve the quality
of assistance

122
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:21,320
to people affected by disaster or conflict

123
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:26,770
as well as the accountability
of humanitarian actors.

124
00:07:26,770 --> 00:07:31,230
Finally, an important set off laws that
influences humanitarian action

125
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:35,680
is the international humanitarian law (IHL).

126
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,520
Or also known as the laws of war 
and the law of armed conflict.

127
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:46,270
We could talk hours about IHL but rather, 
let's have a look to the short animation.

128
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,930
Since the beginning,

129
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:55,760
humans have resorted to violence as
a way to settle disagreements.

130
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,285
Yet through the ages,

131
00:07:57,285 --> 00:08:02,192
people from around the world have tried
to limit the brutality of war.

132
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:12,510
It was this humanitarian spirit that led to 
the first Geneva Convention of 1864

133
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:16,310
and to the birth of modern 
international humanitarian law.

134
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:22,260
Setting the basic limits on how wars
can be fought,

135
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:27,270
these universal laws of war protect
those not fighting.

136
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:30,750
As well as those no longer able to.

137
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:31,760
To do this,

138
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:36,240
a distinction must always be made
between who or what may be attacked

139
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,740
and who or what must be spared
and protected.

140
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:43,480
Most importantly,
civilians can never be targeted.

141
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,070
To do so is a war crime.

142
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,980
When they drove into our village,

143
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:57,070
they shouted that they were going
to kill everyone.

144
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:57,931
I was so scared.

145
00:08:57,931 --> 00:08:59,839
I ran to hide in the Bush.

146
00:09:02,423 --> 00:09:04,473
I heard my mom was screaming

147
00:09:04,473 --> 00:09:07,303
I thought i would never see her again

148
00:09:10,213 --> 00:09:14,490
Every possible care must be taken
to avoid harming civilians

149
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:18,746
or destroying things essential for their survival.

150
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:26,000
They have a right to receive the help they need.

151
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:37,507
The conditions prisoners lived in

152
00:09:37,507 --> 00:09:39,947
never use to bother me

153
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:46,010
People like him were the reason
my brother was dead.

154
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,920
He was the enemy and was nothing to me,

155
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:51,470
but then i realized that behind bars

156
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:56,980
he was out of action and no longer
a threat to me and my family.

157
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:01,750
The laws of war prohibit torture and 
other ill treatment of detainees

158
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,260
whatever their past.

159
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:08,220
They must be given food and water;

160
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:12,720
and allowed to communicate
with loved ones.

161
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,800
This preserves their dignity
and keeps them alive.

162
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:27,730
Medical workers save lives sometimes 
in the most dangerous condition.

163
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:35,450
Fighters from both sides were
wounded in a deadly battle.

164
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:38,730
We were taking them to the nearest
hospital.

165
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:43,500
At the checkpoints, a soldier threatened us 
to treat his men only.

166
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,080
We were running out of time

167
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:49,240
and I was afraid that now 
all of them were going to die.

168
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:53,000
Medical workers must always be 
allowed to do their job.

169
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,430
And the Red Cross or Red Crescent
must not be attacked.

170
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:59,270
The sick or wounded have a right
to be cared for

171
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:02,216
regardless of whose side they're on.

172
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:12,850
Advances in weapons technology have
meant that the rules of war

173
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,760
have also had to adapt.

174
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,270
Because some weapons and
methods of warfare

175
00:11:18,270 --> 00:11:21,480
don't distinguish between fighters
and civilians,

176
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:24,244
limits on the use have been agreed.

177
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:36,190
In the future, wars may be fought
with fully autonomous robots.

178
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,280
But will such robots ever have the ability

179
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:44,530
to distinguish between a military target
and someone who must never be attacked ?

180
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,480
No matter how sophisticated
weapons become,

181
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,620
It is essential that they are in line
with the rules of war.

182
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:03,680
International humanitarian law is
all about making choices

183
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,630
that preserve a minimal of human dignity
in times of war

184
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:11,200
and make sure that living together again 
is possible

185
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,800
once the last bullet has been shot.

186
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,820
During this week, we have seen that

187
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,010
the traditional model of relief,
rehabilitation and development

188
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:27,710
is changing due to a growing number
of protacted conflicts and chronic crisis.

189
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:30,250
There are various factors not always coordinated,

190
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,970
that are struggling to meet
these unpresidented humanitarian needs;

191
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:38,510
the concept as well as practices of principle
humanitarian action

192
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:40,730
are increasingly being challenged;

193
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,190
especially current conflicts.

194
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:46,470
However in such a complex and
changing environment

195
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:49,010
these principles must remain
a reference tool

196
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:53,440
to guide humanitarian action.
