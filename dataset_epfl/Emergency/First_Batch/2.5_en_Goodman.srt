00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:13,740
Now you are familiar with the concept of urban essential services.
Let's see how protracted conflicts affect these services. 

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:19,450
In this lecture, you will learn to describe
the different types of feedbacks on essential urban services

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,460
encountered in humanitarian crisis.

4
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:29,400
Then you will be able to explain the resulting
impacts on civilian population and public health.

5
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:34,660
Protracted conflicts have different
types of impacts on urban essential services.

6
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,100
We can differentiate the direct impact which is the immediate

7
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:47,850
and physical impact caused directly by armed conflicts
such as the damages to essential urban infrastructure due to

8
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:48,320
a bombing.

9
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:57,640
The indirect impact which derives from direct
impact affecting an associated component of a system

10
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:05,580
usually in the short to medium term. An example is
the brain drain that occurs following attacks on staff.

11
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:12,740
This impact can accumulate over time
resulting for instance in a lack of maintenance planning

12
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:15,670
due to insufficient long term staffing.

13
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:24,510
Now let's see more into details how these different
types of impacts affect the three critical elements of essential

14
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,260
services.

15
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:36,770
One of the obvious direct impact on people is the
casualties among essential staff due to the conflict. As a result,

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:43,640
there are fewer staff reporting to work and fewer
staff willing to go to the field to conduct routine operations

17
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:43,370
and maintenance work.

18
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:53,280
Another direct impact on people is poor
or complete lack of access to a service component.

19
00:01:55,550 --> 00:02:02,610
Here an example of the ICRC providing secured
access to municipal workers in order to perform emergency repairs.

20
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:03,950
An

21
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:11,510
indirect impact on critical people occurs when armed
conflicts and sanctions begin to affect the country's economy.

22
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:19,660
It often results in staff salaries being reduced or
delayed. As a consequence, staff services resign

23
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:25,580
or lose motivation reducing the likelihood of routine
operation and maintenance from being carried out.

24
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:30,560
We have seen the destruction or damage to infrastructure

25
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:37,810
and equipment is an example of direct impact on hardware.
However this pictures doesn't illustrate a direct impact

26
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:44,930
but an indirect one.
Indeed this pipe is leaking not because of explosive munitions

27
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,050
but due to the coping mechanism of people affected.

28
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:52,570
The inhabitants were no longer supplied by the main network

29
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:56,980
and they made holes in the nearest pipes
in order to have access to water.

30
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:04,250
Sometimes coping mechanism from inhabitants
can result in negative effects on public health.

31
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:12,180
Another example of an indirect impact on critical
hardware is this water pumping station.

32
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:21,510
In that case, functional equipment were removed gradually
by water utility staff to a more crucial part of the system in

33
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:30,520
order to respond to an emergency.
As a result, this water pumping was rendered completely inoperable.

34
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:36,170
We call this phenomena canibalisation of
critical hardware components.

35
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:44,850
Direct impact on critical consumables is related
primarily to the destruction such as in this picture of the

36
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:49,060
destruction of a warehouse of an
electrical utility following a bombing.

37
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:55,690
As a result the electrical company
lost its capacity to react to breakdowns.

38
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,920
Looting of water electricity providers warehouses
is a classic example of indirect impact on critical consumables

39
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:07,900
as you can see here in the picture
of the looted water treatment plants.

40
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:16,880
Cumulative impact is the long term deterioration
in the performance of essential services through

41
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:24,530
incremental direct and indirect impacts on one or
more of the critical components of the essential services.

42
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:34,070
Cumulative impact on essential services can be
seen as a vicious cycle influenced by direct and indirect impact.

43
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:42,320
The accumulation ultimately, affects public health
and may contribute to the very conflict which creates it.

44
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:50,260
The cycle of impacts therefore lies within the
cycle of conflicts that characterizes complex emergencies.

45
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:59,420
The cumulative impact of protracted armed conflicts on public
health is much more difficult to track than its impact on the

46
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:02,370
quality of coverage of any essential service.

47
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:11,510
One short disruption to the drinking water supply, as
might be expected at the start of the hostilities, can greatly

48
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:18,120
increase their probability of infection from diseases
already present in the environment if the quality of the service

49
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:19,980
was originally reliable.

50
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:29,810
As people’s immunities build up with repeated disruptions to
the water service, it is difficult to generalize the impact that

51
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:38,350
any disruption would have on general health of the
population. However, the risk of a sustained increase in the

52
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:44,110
incidence of endemic diseases is enhanced
as the conflict drives more people

53
00:05:44,210 --> 00:05:48,190
and strains of illness into the city, particularly

54
00:05:48,230 --> 00:05:53,210
when the movements of people are coupled with
poor general treatment of water and waste water

55
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,200
and incomplete immunisation campaigns.

56
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:03,950
Direct, indirect, cumulative.
I hope now that you are clear about the distinction of those

57
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:07,810
different types of impacts of protracted
conflicts on essential urban services.

58
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:13,840
Direct damage to infrastructure from
explosive munitions attract to the most attention

59
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,990
but remember, field experience suggests
that the cumulative impact is the most destructive

60
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:23,730
and the most difficult to recover from.
