00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:11,090
Welcome to this first week of this MOOC.
During this week we will introduce you to the topic 

2
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:16,130
a of public health engineering and see how engineers
can have a significant impact to reduce the mortality

3
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:19,790
and morbidity encountered in many humanitarian contexts.

4
00:00:20,810 --> 00:00:24,650
You will learn about the link
between health and water, sanitation

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:32,010
and hygiene, so-called wash activities. Engineers in
humanitarian assistance should have a good understanding on how

6
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:38,860
infectious disease are transmitted. This is why you
will be introduced to different environmental transmission pathways

7
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,720
of diseases

8
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,650
and we will see some measures to be
taken to prevent the spread of diseases.

9
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:47,900
In particular, we will
talk about water quality

10
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:53,950
and quantity requirements in complex
emergencies as well as vector control measures.

11
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,600
In this video, we
will answer to the

12
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:03,220
question why public health engineering matters in
humanitarian crisis. In order to do so,

13
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:05,000
we need to understand the public health

14
00:01:05,090 --> 00:01:09,590
approach that guides humanitarian
assistance of many humanitarian organizations.

15
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,680
It will help us to explain
the role of the public health engineering.

16
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:23,700
Finally, we will learn to identify some of the risks that put health
population particularly at risk during humanitarian situations.

17
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:29,530
Public health is defined as the art and
science of preventing disease, prolonging life

18
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,530
and promoting health through the
organized effort of society.

19
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,570
How is it translated
into humanitarian action?

20
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:42,920
Let's go back to 1979 at
the thai-cambodian border

21
00:01:43,070 --> 00:01:52,400
where more than one million refugees are gathered in refugee camps.
At that time humanitarian assistance was mainly devoted to

22
00:01:52,410 --> 00:02:01,670
surgical and curative care. Activities dealing with water
supply, sanitation or nutrition were perceived as secondary.

23
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,900
Facing a higher rate

24
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:08,060
of mortality and morbidity in these
refugee camps due to diarrhea

25
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:17,320
and vector borne diseases, an ICRC doctor named Pierre Perrin,
came up with what we called the pyramid of health model.

26
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:22,030
An idea that helped to change
the way the ICRC

27
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:27,120
and other humanitarian organizations
respond to humanitarian crises.

28
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:37,630
This model advocated to move emergency health programs
towards a broader public health orientation in order to preserve

29
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,950
life and health

30
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:46,670
and ensure respect for people's dignity. At the top of
the pyramid of health are the activities related to curative

31
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:54,480
care. That is medical interventions, generally done
at the field hospital when people are already sick

32
00:02:54,650 --> 00:03:03,550
or injured. In the middle are prevention
measures such as vaccinations, distribution of medicines

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:11,580
or health education. While at the foundation
of the pyramid there are two key building blocks: nutrition

34
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:20,970
and public health engineering, which usually in humanitarian
contexts, aim to provide an adequate drinking water supply,

35
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:21,770
a proper excreta management,

36
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:30,840
runoff and waste water disposal, collection and
disposal of refuse and medical waste

37
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:33,810
and effective vector control interventions.

38
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:42,590
The idea behind the pyramid of health is that it makes no sense
to manage health issues of vulnerable people only from the top

39
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:49,070
with medical corrective care if their immediate
environment is the cause of their unhealthy state.

40
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:57,260
Tackling the root of the problem, particularly for infectious
diseases rather than only treating patients, is much more

41
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:03,900
effective to reach out a large population.
This approach was implemented in the eighties and very well

42
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:09,400
documented researches are shown that
the provision of adequate food, clean water, sanitation

43
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:15,870
and shelter activities were much more effective
than most medical programs to tackle diarrhea

44
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:21,650
and vector borne diseases. This is why this
model advocates for public health engineering

45
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:29,410
and nutrition activities to be done in close collaboration
with medical activities in order to achieve a public health

46
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:30,150
objective.

47
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:37,790
In order to understand the role of the public health engineer,
we have to look at the interaction between a population

48
00:04:37,990 --> 00:04:42,590
and its environment. All that
can be schematized in the following diagram.

49
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,590
We see that in one side, the elements

50
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:50,160
originating in the environment which are
necessary to maintain a population’s life

51
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:57,990
and health such as water, food, energy, raw
materials for walls, materials for building a shelter

52
00:04:58,340 --> 00:05:05,240
and also vectors of diseases such as rats
and mosquitoes and on the other side the waste

53
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:11,900
that the population is discharging to the environment in
the form of human excreta, garbage and liquid waste.

54
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,460
Between these two poles a vicious
cycle may be created.

55
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,670
Infectious diseases can be transmitted by direct
contact within the population, but also through the environment.

56
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:33,250
I give you an example. If human wastes are disposed inadequately
to the environment, it can lead to a proliferation of

57
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:36,260
pathogens contained in the
faeces in the water for instance.

58
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:44,730
As a result, it may lead to an increase of incidence
of diarrheal diseases within the population, which itself leads to an

59
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:52,390
increase of the contamination of the environment, which
leads to an increase of pathogens and so on. A vicious cycle.

60
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:58,560
Public health engineering relies on the
concept that certain hazards to the infection pathogens

61
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:03,350
or chemicals move through the environment
and cause harm to humans.

62
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:09,970
Therefore, public health engineering measures
focus on preventing the creation of hazards, its transport

63
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,610
and the people from being
exposed to it once encountered.

64
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:20,740
In the case of human waste for instance which we
mentioned earlier, we cannot avoid its creation

65
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:28,370
but the public health engineering can reduce
the spread of human waste in the environment by setting for instance a

66
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,760
proper sanitation system.
It can also treat water

67
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:38,390
and promote proper food hygiene practices in order to
reduce the exposure of people to faeces contained in the contaminated

68
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,200
food or water.

69
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:46,500
Another example in the case of the cambodian refugee camp,
we have seen earlier in the video. The fact that the camp was

70
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:53,180
moved away from the breeding site of the mosquitoes,
results actually in the reduction of the malaria mortality by

71
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:56,570
half and the incidence
rate by two thirds.

72
00:06:57,670 --> 00:07:03,230
Now we understand there the role of the engineer is
actually to put the barriers of the creation, transport

73
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:06,890
and exposures to hazards
to improve the health.

74
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:15,570
Now because one barrier rarely functions at one hundred percent,
public health engineers should put multiple barriers.

75
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,740
In order to know where and

76
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:22,510
when to put these barriers to stop the vicious cycle
of transmission of the disease, the public health engineers should

77
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,490
have a very good understanding of the transmission cycle of the disease.

78
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:35,220
In a humanitarian context, the role of the public health
engineer is crucial because the population are particularly at

79
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:37,160
risk of the vicious cycle.

80
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:47,710
Indeed, factors such as overcrowding to the
influx of displaced persons, deterioration of essential services

81
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,620
and infrastructures such as healthcare, water

82
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:58,690
and sanitation systems, poor housing conditions in temporary
settlements of damaged structures, lower immunity due to

83
00:07:58,700 --> 00:08:03,900
malnutrition or lack of health care, all that
aggravates the vulnerability of the population

84
00:08:03,930 --> 00:08:06,390
to infectious diseases.

85
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:10,000
Let's sumarize this first lesson.
Communicable diseases such as the diarrheal diseases

86
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:14,990
and malaria are a major cause of mortality

87
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:20,510
and morbidity in humanitarian contexts where the
population is particularly at risk of contamination.

88
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:29,740
In order to protect the health of those affected
by humanitarian crises, it is absolutely crucial to ensure adequate

89
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:33,200
shelter, water, sanitation and food

90
00:08:33,370 --> 00:08:41,010
and provide basic health care. As such it requires the
collaboration between these different sectors to achieve a truly

91
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:44,660
integrated public health approach in the humanitarian response.

92
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,810
It is the role of the public health engineer to put
the barriers in the environmental transmission pathways of

93
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:58,540
diseases through the implementation of measures
dealing with water supply, excreta management,

94
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:07,520
runoff and waste water disposal, hygiene promotion,
collection and waste disposal of refuse and medical waste

95
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,950
and vector control.

96
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:15,530
Depending on the organization, this public health
engineer is called the environmental health specialist,

97
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:20,650
the wash specialist or the water and
habitats such as in the ICRC.

98
00:09:21,990 --> 00:09:28,780
Now, in order to design a good public health engineering
intervention, the public health engineers require a very good

99
00:09:28,790 --> 00:09:35,420
understanding of the transmission cycle of diseases.
And that is what we will explain in the next videos.
