1
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,980
The results of an emergency can be very severe. 

2
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:21,510
What we see often is people arrive, for example
in these displace camps with absolutely nothing.

3
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:27,369
They have walked for a long way and they can
arrive incredibly dehydrated, haven’t eaten

4
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:31,759
for a number of days, they desperately need
food and then, the other big one is shelter

5
00:00:31,759 --> 00:00:33,739
as well.

6
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:40,829
Access to water becomes a life threatening
problem, so it is vitally important that at

7
00:00:40,829 --> 00:01:06,780
that time we use the adequate resources to
give them what they need.

8
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:11,980
The biggest problem for us is to keep up with
the population of the camp.

9
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:18,140
What we see in a lot of cases is that the
camp starts at maybe a figure of 5000, 10000

10
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,140
people.

11
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:25,920
We start doing the work based on those figures
and people keep coming.

12
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,649
One of the options we use is water tracking.

13
00:01:28,649 --> 00:01:33,259
As soon as we get the water tracking in a place,
at the same time we are already looking for

14
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:34,280
an intermediate solution.

15
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,170
So looking at digging wells, drilling of
boreholes and setting up the pumping station

16
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,210
from the lake or river.

17
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:52,939
It’s always very important to involve the beneficiaries
in the design of whatever we do.

18
00:01:52,939 --> 00:01:57,540
It is quite surprising how quickly the camps
organise themselves.

19
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,240
It is quite often that committees set up quite
quickly and we work with them to make sure

20
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:10,070
we understand what the needs are and also
to pass to the population the messages about

21
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:14,880
the projects we are doing.

22
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:21,819
A minimum amount of water that a human needs to
survive each day is three litres, that’s

23
00:02:21,819 --> 00:02:24,260
enough for drinking and enough for eating.

24
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:30,530
In actual fact what we should be trying to
do is supply five times as much as that.

25
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:32,580
Camps can be very difficult.

26
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,510
Basically, the biggest problem is the fact
that you have so many people in such a small

27
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:38,510
area.

28
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:44,930
So, you immediately get a much higher risk
of disease transmission.

29
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:51,730
Another activity we often do in camps is to
look at the sanitation.

30
00:02:51,730 --> 00:03:00,190
So this is to look at construction of latrines
and construction of systems for waste disposal.

31
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:06,200
Linked to that as well is the hygiene promotion,
so we do hygiene promotion activities to pass

32
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:12,489
basic messages to people about how to use
the systems that have been installed in the

33
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,879
camp.

34
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:25,700
We are trying to ensure that the condition
that the water is installed at the household

35
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:34,260
level is safe, that they are protected against
mosquitoes and blankets and sleeping mats just

36
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,629
to prevent as well acute respiratory infections.

37
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:44,830
We have a very extensive logistics set up.

38
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:52,720
So if there is an emergency we need to send
materials or staff, we can react quickly.

39
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,269
Another advantage we have is the flexibility
which is given to us by our donors, so it

40
00:03:58,269 --> 00:04:02,970
means that we have the money available if
and when we decide that we need to respond

41
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:04,640
to the emergency.

42
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:10,260
We like to think that the flexibility
with the donors is built upon trust from basically

43
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,140
the evidence that responses we have
done in the past.

44
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:22,040
Responding to an emergency, there is the vulnerability
to being used for political gain.

45
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:28,910
It is one of the skills that our staff have
picked up is to how to approach relevant people,

46
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:33,960
how to talk to them, how to explain to them,
what we are doing and why we are doing it and it’s

47
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,310
purely on a humanitarian basis.

48
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:42,949
For shelter, we can have a number of different
approaches based on the needs.

49
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:48,581
At the most basic level, it can be a distribution
of plastic sheeting either to protect them

50
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:53,310
from the sun or to protect
themselves from the rain.

51
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,650
We also can do a distribution of tents, so
these are basically a standard tent which

52
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:01,970
is suitable for a family.

53
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:06,640
Another type of shelter response we can do
is the construction of a more permanent shelter.

54
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:12,419
So technically, this can be iron roofing sheets,
timber for constructing walls.

55
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:20,030
In this way, they can have a shelter which
can be constructed quickly but also it is materials

56
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:25,970
that can be taken home in the end when they
return back to their villages and used to

57
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,770
perhaps, repair their shelters.

58
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:34,139
The first time you respond to an emergency
is very difficult but you learn an awful lot

59
00:05:34,139 --> 00:05:39,190
the first time and after that, you build up
a knowledge, you build up an awareness of what

60
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:45,470
an emergency is about and that helps the staff
a lot in responding to future emergencies.
