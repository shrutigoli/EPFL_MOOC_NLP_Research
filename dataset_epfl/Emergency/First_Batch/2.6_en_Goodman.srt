00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:11,410
During the last videos, we have seen the external nature
of the impact of the deprivation of urban services during 

2
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:12,720
times of armed conflict.

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:22,450
There is a need for remove from traditional assistance
paradigm to one that takes account of the longer term realities

4
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:26,970
and needs in urban areas affected
by ongoing armed conflicts.

5
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:34,000
In this video, we would like you to suggest
the way forward to best meet the challenges

6
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,880
and to ensure the right response
in the right place at the right time.

7
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:47,130
The main objective is to stimulate discussion on the
relevance of humanitarian response to essential

8
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,990
urban services disruption
in protracted conflicts.

9
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:57,520
The challenge of maintaining essential services in urban
context subject to protracted armed conflict is conceptualized here.

10
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:06,130
The figure shows that the quality of the service
or number of residents covered decreases cumulatively

11
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:09,900
and progressively over time as a result of direct

12
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:19,640
and indirect impacts. The impact on residents increases
exponentially over time. The duration of this challenge should be

13
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:24,730
taken into account in the humanitarian
response as well as the scale of the challenge.

14
00:01:25,270 --> 00:01:33,560
Indeed, infrastructure is so complex in large cities that the restoration
of part of it can immediately benefit several hundreds thousands of

15
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,750
people but the option is often
too costly for municipalities

16
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:42,860
and humanitarian agencies that are geared
to more traditional emergency responses.

17
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:48,290
For instance, in case of damage
to water supply infrastructure,

18
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,900
typical relief response

19
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:57,200
such as water trucking to schools and idp camps take no
account of the repairs needed to the municipal network

20
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:03,950
and critical infrastructure which are essential
to ensure service delivery not only for

21
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:07,030
hustle but also for the emergency
response themselves.

22
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,300
However, distinctions between
the stages of relief rehabilitation

23
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:19,410
development response are not necessarily
relevant in urban contexts. Multiple types of programs may be required

24
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:25,850
simultaneously in the same city.
For instance in 2010 in Baghdad, the ICRC

25
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,660
intervention covered the full spectrum.

26
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,710
Large hospitals

27
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:35,900
and waste water infrastructure rehabilitation projects were
established to support the government's long term development plan.

28
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:43,690
Alongside, basic maintenance of existing health and
water facilities which could be labelled reconstruction.

29
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,500
And water trucking programs to informal
settlements of I.D.Ps, a typical relief activity.

30
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:58,920
Interconnectivity between essential services needs to be
understood and properly integrated into the humanitarian

31
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:07,490
response in order to avoid counter productive effects.
For instance, in this picture, retrofiting the broken

32
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:14,840
water supply network to the squatter, without addressing
the damage sewage evacuation network would increase the

33
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:21,530
exposure of the population to public health
risks by causing sewage to spill over into the streets.

34
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,760
Essential services rely on three critical
components: people, hardware

35
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:38,030
and consumables. Experience tends to show that of all the
three components of an essential service, people may be the most

36
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,600
crucial. Effective partnerships with local authorities

37
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:49,180
and service providers become indispensable in
complex urban environments, much more than for rural areas where people

38
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:52,940
can organize themselves around
less sophisticated services.

39
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,310
It is widely accepted that including
beneficiaries in the conception, implementation

40
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,020
and management is vital to the
effectiveness as well as to the

41
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:12,050
sustainability of an intervention. However, community
involvement in urban areas is very different from the common

42
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,250
understanding based on rural experience.

43
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:17,890
Working with local people to repair

44
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:25,930
or rehabilitate essential services in urban contexts also poses
some particular challenges. Humanitarian assistance should

45
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:30,100
not focus only on community based approach assistance.

46
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:38,970
It is arguably more beneficial to restore water to an entire
neighbourhood by repairing for instance a transmission line

47
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,720
than to assist household level coping mechanisms.
International Humanitarian Law, IHL,

48
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:55,360
offers a degree of protection. However, while IHL
protects all service components from the direct impact of armed

49
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:59,650
conflicts, there are specific challenges arising from its interpretation

50
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:08,870
and application in urban warfare, in particular the extent
to which IHL provides protection against the indirect

51
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:15,260
or cumulative impact of hostilities on
essential services. The ICRC

52
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:22,400
is actively seeking to address some of these challenges,
in particular through its work on the use of explosive weapons

53
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:23,670
in populated areas.

54
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:32,400
Donors should reconsider the funding scams to ensure that
they match the scale and duration of the challenge.

55
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:37,370
Relief, rehabilitation and development
efforts will be much more expensive

56
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:43,930
and take far longer if humanitarian agencies
in coordination with local service providers enable to

57
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,960
mitigate the consequences of indirect and cumulative effects.

58
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,830
Twelve months funding designed for disaster relief

59
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:59,140
or very short conflicts are not adequate to stabilise
or restore essential urban services in protracted armed conflicts.

60
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:03,780
To appropriately address the complexity of essential urban

61
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:11,150
services during protracted armed conflicts, larger
budgets that cover a longer period are needed.

62
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:19,060
Finally, more research needs to be conducted
on the impact of disruptions to urban services

63
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:21,250
on people's lives over time.

64
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:30,560
One priority area is the need to gain an understanding of
how disruption to services affect people's livelihood,

65
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:33,400
food security, human security and health.

66
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:38,590
Many humanitarian agencies have programs
targeting the direct impact of this destruction

67
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:45,580
but not the indirect or cumulative impact on the broader
nexus of interrelated humanitarian issues of concern.

68
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:54,530
I hope that this video has helped you to have a
much needed discussion on how to develop a better approach to assisting

69
00:06:54,540 --> 00:07:02,230
people in urban areas that have been affected by
protracted armed conflicts. If you'd like to know more details on the

70
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,550
topic you can read this ICRC publication, which combines
current research with over three decades of ICRC

71
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,190
experience in urban areas.

72
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:19,810
Now in order to summarize these three videos, on urban
services during protracted conflict, let's watch this short

73
00:07:19,820 --> 00:08:04,020
animation.
