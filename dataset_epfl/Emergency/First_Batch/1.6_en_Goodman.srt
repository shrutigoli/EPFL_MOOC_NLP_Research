1
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:09,130
Now you know about some of the specific pathogens
that can cause diarrheal disease and that

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,880
most of these pathogens originate in human
or animal faeces.

3
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,820
Well there are so many different pathogens,
It is impractical to try and measure them all

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:24,029
so what we do instead is we use indicator
species to indicate the presence of faecal

5
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:25,029
contamination.

6
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:30,740
Today, we will talk about those indicators
species. It would be impractical and impossible

7
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:36,620
actually to directly measure all the different
pathogens that could cause diarrheal disease.

8
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:42,589
So instead, we look for indicator species
that can show the presence of faecal contamination.

9
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:47,609
Some characteristics of an ideal faecal indicator
are that it should be something that is universally

10
00:00:47,609 --> 00:00:52,629
present in the faeces of both human
and animals in large numbers.

11
00:00:52,629 --> 00:00:56,520
Those numbers should be higher than the actual
numbers of the pathogens of interest.

12
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:02,920
And the indicators should not be harmful or
pathogenic in itself. It should be something

13
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,740
that's readily detected using simple
inexpensive methods.

14
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:14,710
And it should also persist in the environment
or water in a similar manner to faecal pathogens.

15
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:21,310
You wouldn't want it to actually grow in natural
waters because then you would get misrepresentation

16
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:28,570
and finally, if possible, the indicator should respond
to treatment in a similar fashion to faecal

17
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,280
pathogens.

18
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:37,310
One of the most common indicator species is
a bacteria class called total coliforms.

19
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:42,200
Total coliforms are bacteria that can ferment
lactose and produce acid in gas at thirty

20
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:44,190
five degrees Celsius.

21
00:01:44,190 --> 00:01:50,340
There are many different families of coliforms:
citrobacter, klebsiella, hafnia and enterobacter

22
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:56,979
and for this reason, total coliforms is not
really useful as a faecal indicator because

23
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:00,540
many of these bacteria have non faecal sources.

24
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,510
However, total coliforms can be useful for
operational monitoring to demonstrate for

25
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:11,740
example the effectiveness of treatment or
overall cleanliness and integrity in the distribution

26
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,710
system.

27
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,470
Thermotolerant coliforms, as the name implies,
can tolerate heat and these are a subset of

28
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,090
the total coliform class.

29
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:27,750
Thermotolerant coliforms are what used to
be called faecal coliforms and they can ferment

30
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:32,110
lactose within forty eight hours at
44 degrees Celsius.

31
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,560
Faeces contain a large number of thermotolerant
coliforms but there are some indications of

32
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:45,610
non-faecal sources of thermotolerant coliforms
such as klebsiella and some species of enterobacter.

33
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:51,730
Also, there's evidence that thermotolerants
under some conditions can grow or die off

34
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:59,840
in water at ambient temperatures so it's not
a bad indicator but it has some limitations.

35
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:06,730
Escherichia coli or E. coli is one specific
species of thermotolerant coliforms that is

36
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,890
generally agreed to be the most suitable
indicator of faecal contamination.

37
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:18,050
There is some possibility that the E. coli
may grow in the environment in tropical settings

38
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:23,480
and it is only moderately persistent so the
absence of E. coli doesn't necessarily mean

39
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:26,630
the absence of faecal contamination.

40
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:32,810
However, on balance, considering all the different
ideal characteristics of an indicator bacteria,

41
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:37,960
E. coli is considered to be the
best available option.

42
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,920
Indicator bacteria are usually reported in
terms of the number of counts or colonies

43
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:45,870
in a one hundred millilitre sample.

44
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:52,940
Many drinking water standards and W.H.O guidelines
are set to be no detectable E. coli or thermotolerant

45
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:56,410
coliforms in a one hundred ml sample.

46
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,480
You can consider that water that has higher
levels of indicator bacteria is probably more

47
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:07,790
likely to have higher levels of faecal contamination
though there is not a very clear correlation

48
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:11,940
between indicator bacteria and pathogens on
the other hand.

49
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:18,150
Still, water having very high levels of E.coli,
more than one thousand counts

50
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,990
per 100 ml, is probably very risky for consumption.

51
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:29,050
Water having no detectable E.coli in it, however,
might not be completely safe because E. coli

52
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:37,150
is relatively less persistent and robust in
the environment compared to some pathogens.

53
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:42,000
For this reason, it would be preferable to
combine a measure of water quality, such as

54
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:48,759
E. coli measure, with some kind of assessment
of the system safety like a sanitary inspection

55
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:53,740
which identifies a number of risk factors
at a water source.

56
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:59,580
Then by combining a water quality measure,
on the vertical axis, and water management

57
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:05,919
measure, on the horizontal axis, we could make
a risk matrix and prioritize areas, water

58
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,990
sources for interventions.

59
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:15,710
Well, E. coli or thermotolerant coliforms
are the most commonly used indicator species.

60
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:19,970
Other indicators might be more relevant for
certain purposes.

61
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:25,100
Viruses travel in the environment very differently
than bacteria so one might want to look at

62
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:32,490
coliphage viruses that require a bacteria
host to survive as an indicator for viruses.

63
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:39,770
Faecal streptococci are more hardy, robust
bacteria compared to E. coli. so they could

64
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:45,810
persist longer in the environment and maybe
be a better indicator of long term faecal

65
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:47,090
contamination.

66
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:52,610
Traditionally, methods for enumerating faecal
streptococci have been more complicated but

67
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:56,139
this is changing with the
development of new methods.

68
00:05:56,139 --> 00:06:03,330
Finally, protozoa can be very resistant to
disinfection, to heat, to chlorine, to ozone,

69
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:09,620
so E.coli is not a good indicator for treatment
efficacy but some bacteria like clostridium

70
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:17,069
perfringens or some bacillus spp. can form
spores which are roughly similar in size and

71
00:06:17,069 --> 00:06:20,949
resistance to some protozoan pathogens.

72
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:29,080
Now, let's focus in on those pathways between
faeces and faces that involve water.

73
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,830
We can think about a safe water chain with
different stages where contamination could

74
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,229
be introduced.

75
00:06:35,229 --> 00:06:39,979
Contamination could occur at the water resource
itself or during delivery to the consumer.

76
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:45,529
Faecal matter can also be introduced during
the collection and transport of water if the

77
00:06:45,529 --> 00:06:47,990
source is outside the home.

78
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:52,580
When water is stored inside the household
it could become contaminated and finally the

79
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:59,360
drinking water vessel itself, a cup or a glass
might be dirty and introduce faecal matter.

80
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:04,840
Now let's look at an illustration of these
different stages in a safe water chain.

81
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:12,370
First, the water resource itself can be contaminated
from contact with human or animal faeces.

82
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:17,650
Surface water often contains faecal bacteria
but even ground water aquifers can be contaminated

83
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:21,699
by inadequately managed sanitation.

84
00:07:21,699 --> 00:07:26,490
Even if the water resource is clean or if
water is purified at a treatment plant, it

85
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:31,539
can become contaminated during delivery to
the consumer for example in a piped water

86
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:36,779
supply, if there is not continuous pressure
in the distribution system contaminated water

87
00:07:36,779 --> 00:07:40,870
may enter the pipes through cracks or joints.

88
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:45,830
Another example though could be an improperly
constructed rising main on a bore hole or

89
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:51,360
suction hand pumps which are primed with unsafe
water.

90
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,969
The point of collection itself can be contaminated,
think of a communal tap or borehole spout

91
00:07:56,969 --> 00:08:02,850
which is handled and contacted by adults,
children and even animals. And when the point

92
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:06,770
of collection is outside the home, people
must use containers which themselves may be

93
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:11,800
dirty and people often rinse containers and
wipe them with their hands before filling

94
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:18,630
them up but if their hands are not clean this
may not help at all.

95
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,680
The containers must then be transported back
to the household giving another opportunity

96
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,129
for contamination.

97
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:29,610
Open containers are especially vulnerable
because it is easy to contact the water with

98
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:38,680
hands during lifting and carrying and also
dust or insects can enter an uncovered container.

99
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:43,040
Once the water is taken to the household it
is often transferred to another container

100
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:48,730
and may be stored on unhygienically, in open
containers or on the floor where children

101
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:52,130
and animals can introduce pathogens.

102
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:57,070
Point of use water treatment at this stage
offers the possibility of inactivating pathogens

103
00:08:57,070 --> 00:09:03,700
introduced at earlier points in the water
chain.

104
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:08,010
But even after storage, contamination
possibilities exist.

105
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:13,400
Water may be retrieved from storage containers
using an unclean dipper or ladle, especially

106
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,670
if the storage container is uncovered.

107
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:23,490
Finally the drinking vessel itself, a cup
or glass or perhaps a gourd can be full of

108
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,190
faecal contamination.

109
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:30,030
Again, people may wipe the drinking vessel
with their hands before using it but this

110
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:34,680
might actually make the glass dirtier.

111
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,510
So there are many opportunities for contamination
between the original source of drinking water

112
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,280
and the actual point of consumption.

113
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:47,130
A big advantage of household water treatment
is that it offers the possibility of removing

114
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:52,580
any contamination that is introduced at the
water resource, the delivery system or through

115
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:55,270
collection and transport.

116
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:59,580
Many household water treatments don't prevent
recontamination so it is important to have

117
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:05,580
safe storage after a treatment step. And likewise,
good hygiene, especially washing hands with

118
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:11,600
soap, is important to minimize the possibility
of clean drinking water becoming contaminated

119
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:18,390
just before consumption by using a cup or
glass that is faecally contaminated.

120
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,640
So in this module we have talked about different
indicators of faecal contamination and how

121
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:28,150
E. coli is the preferred indicator bacteria
and we have talked about different stages

122
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:35,510
along the safe water chain from catchment
to cup where drinking water can become contaminated.
