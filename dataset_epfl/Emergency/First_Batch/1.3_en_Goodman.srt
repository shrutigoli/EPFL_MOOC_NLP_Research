00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:09,880
Welcome to this video on environmental transmission
pathways.

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:14,830
Infectious diseases are a main cause of mortality
and morbidity in humanitarian crises.

3
00:00:14,830 --> 00:00:21,939
Tackling them is one of the main goals of
public health engineering interventions.

4
00:00:21,939 --> 00:00:27,779
In order to do so, a good understanding of
transmission cycle of diseases is required.

5
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,689
This is why during this video you will learn
to classify different infectious diseases

6
00:00:32,689 --> 00:00:35,770
according to their transmission routes,

7
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:42,430
get familiar with the so-called F-diagram
and finally you will learn to identify appropriate

8
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:47,190
prevention strategies to tackle
some infectious diseases.

9
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:53,190
In public health engineering, we often use
the so-called Bradley classification to distinct

10
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:58,420
four types of water related roots by
which a disease may be transmitted from one

11
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,219
person to another.

12
00:01:01,219 --> 00:01:07,080
Water-borne diseases are infections which can
be transmitted through drinking water which

13
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:08,840
contains the pathogens.

14
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,820
Water-borne diseases include diarrheal diseases
which is the second leading cause of death

15
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:20,860
in children under five years old and is responsible
for killing more than half a million of children

16
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,420
every year.

17
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:26,860
It also includes infectious hepatitis or polio.

18
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,840
All these diseases are part of the so-called
faecal oral diseases.

19
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,569
That is to say that infections occurring
when pathogens from the faeces of a sick person

20
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:39,859
are ingested by somebody else.

21
00:01:39,859 --> 00:01:44,710
There are many different pathways for the
faeces containing the pathogens to gain entry

22
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:50,140
into the mouth, some are direct and others
indirect.

23
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:54,560
The F-diagram illustrates these main pathways.

24
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,529
They are easily memorized as they all begin
by the letter F. Fluids such as drinking

25
00:02:00,529 --> 00:02:08,580
water, fingers, flies, fields or crops and
soil and food.

26
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,560
In order to stop the transmission of these
diseases, primary barriers can be put to prevent

27
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,840
the initial contact with the faeces.

28
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:23,819
It is mainly done with sanitation intervention
which aims to contain human excreta so that

29
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:27,900
it is not free to spread into the environment.

30
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:33,000
Secondary barriers can also be put to prevent
faeces from being ingested by a new person.

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:39,959
For instance, by ensuring adequate water quality
or ensuring proper hygiene practices mainly

32
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,069
hand washing.

33
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:47,810
In this F-diagram you can clearly see the
importance of having adequate sanitation,

34
00:02:47,810 --> 00:02:55,640
proper hygiene practices and adequate quantity
and quality of water to ensure health benefits.

35
00:02:55,640 --> 00:03:02,290
The second type of water related diseases
are water-washed diseases.

36
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:09,909
Infections that are caused by pathogens whose transmission
can be prevented by improving personal hygiene.

37
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:16,099
Good personal hygiene requires availability
and use of water for bathing, clothes washing

38
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:18,640
and utensils washing.

39
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:26,319
Therefore, the transmission mechanism is related to
the quantity of water rather than water quality.

40
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:32,450
There are three types of water-wash diseases,
the ones associated with the faecal route

41
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:38,750
with similar diseases to water-borne diseases,
infections of skins or eyes that are not related

42
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:44,150
to the faecal oral route but also due to poor
hygiene such as trachoma which is the leading

43
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:47,709
infection caused by blindness worldwide.

44
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,370
And finally infections carried by lice and
which may be reduced by improving personal

45
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,030
hygiene such as typhus.

46
00:03:55,030 --> 00:04:02,390
The third type of water related diseases is
called water-based.

47
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:08,540
Here the pathogen spends part of its life
cycle in the water usually in a snail or another

48
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,439
aquatic animal.

49
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,329
Pathogens usually enter the water from faeces
and urine of an infected person.

50
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:22,590
The pathogen is transmitted by ingestion or
by penetration of the skin.

51
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:28,870
The water-based diseases are all caused by
parasitic worms but not all parasitic worms

52
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:37,370
are water-based but two of the most significant
are the guinea worm and the schistosomiasis.

53
00:04:37,370 --> 00:04:42,530
Schistosomiasis affects millions of people
each year.

54
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:48,250
People become infected when the larval forms
of the parasite released by freshwater snails

55
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:52,669
penetrates the skin during contact with infested
water.

56
00:04:52,669 --> 00:04:57,800
Play habits of school age children such as
swimming or fishing in infested water made

57
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:01,100
them especially vulnerable to infections.

58
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:07,520
Finally, the fourth route of diseases spread
by insects which breed in water or by near

59
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,750
water.

60
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:16,530
Malaria, yellow fever and dengue are diseases
transmitted by these transmission mechanisms.

61
00:05:16,530 --> 00:05:21,610
Knowing the transmission route for diseases
help to identify key interventions to be done

62
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,330
to reduce the spread of diseases.

63
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:29,550
For instance, to tackle water-borne diseases
we need to improve water quality by treating

64
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:33,169
water, preventing its contamination.

65
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:38,240
For water-washed diseases, we have to increase
access and availability of water to ensure

66
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,330
better hygiene.

67
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:46,169
For water-based, it is difficult to treat
infected water surface baddies but we can prevent

68
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:49,530
people from getting into contact with them.

69
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,500
For water related insect vectors, we can apply
some vector control measures that we will see further

70
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,139
in detail during this week.

71
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:03,169
Unlike the conventional biological taxonomy
which classifies diseases according to the nature

72
00:06:03,169 --> 00:06:04,380
of the pathogens,

73
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,330
in public health engineering, we prefer to
classify infectious diseases according to

74
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,400
their environmental transmission pathways.

75
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,210
It is more helpful to identify the type of
environmental measures needed.

76
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:24,250
In this video we have seen the Bradley classification
to describe water related diseases but similar

77
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:30,280
classifications also exist for refuse related
diseases, vector related diseases or housing

78
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:35,860
related diseases such as tuberculosis which
kills more than malaria worldwide.

79
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:41,860
Remember, knowing the transmission cycle of
the disease is key to identify the appropriate

80
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,970
measures to be tackled.
