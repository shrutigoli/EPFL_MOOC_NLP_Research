Nowadays it's normal to think that the plague no longer exists.
But in countries like Congo Kinshasa and Madagascar, people die from this highly contagious disease every year.
In Madagascar, people are still becoming infected and the chance of a major outbreak has not gone away.
Prisoners, often in overcrowded and unhygienic prisons, share their quarters with hundreds of rats and disease carrying fleas.
Although, the spread of plague from rats via fleas to people has been prevented in prisons, the same canâ€™t be said for the rest of the country.
In rural areas, there is little understanding of the plague, often it is something to be ashamed of and covered up.
As a result, not all cases are reported to the authorities by this vulnerable population spread out across a vast territory.
Rafred's daughter, [Maoli], is buried on the hill close to the town centre, where she died two years ago.
The grave is located 30 kilometres away from her village.
Rafred wonâ€™t be able to retrieve his daughterâ€™s body until 2017 after observing a seven year period imposed by the health authority.
Without steps to monitor and check the spread of the disease, the plague is a danger to public health that can quickly get out of hand but the government has adopted a national strategy to fight the disease.
They now keep national statistics for every case of the plague recorded in Madagascar which is then passed on to the World Health
Organization and with ICRC support the prevention campaign in prison goes on.
