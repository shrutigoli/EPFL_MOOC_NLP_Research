00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:09,320
Hello there and welcome to the summary
video of week 4 on sanitation.

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:11,000
I hope you enjoyed the lectures

3
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,720
and learned a lot over the course
of this week

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:16,260
so let's just quickly go through
the main learning

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:20,260
and key takeaway messages of this week.

6
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,690
so this week, we looked at sanitation.

7
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,030
we learned the definition of sanitation;

8
00:00:25,030 --> 00:00:27,436
what a sanitation system is;

9
00:00:27,436 --> 00:00:29,313
and its different elements.

10
00:00:29,313 --> 00:00:34,010
We explored sanitation product terminology
and functional groups

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,510
then we moved to excrete the management
in humanitarian crisis

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,260
where we presented an example
of how sanitation system

13
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:45,500
can be developed over the course of
humanitarian response;

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,970
starting from the acute phase of response
that is fair minimal standards apply

15
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:54,770
to rehabilitation of existing infrastructure
in the recovery period.

16
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,770
Finally, we looked at which selection
criteria need to be considered

17
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:01,950
for choosing the best fit sanitation
service

18
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,260
and a technology that can be best used
for the task.

19
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,190
The importance of sanitation
and effect of the lack of it

20
00:01:11,190 --> 00:01:15,210
were shown very impressively
in the case study from Gaza.

21
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:18,250
There, a wastewater treatment
plant was implemented

22
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,130
in order to treat the sewage.

23
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:23,260
This case study also shows
a humanitarian work

24
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:24,840
in the field of sanitation,

25
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,010
often goes beyond the construction
of on-site emergency latrines.

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:33,760
This graph depicts the five different
functional groups

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,740
that make a sanitation system

28
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:38,220
in order to safely use a toilet,

29
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:45,010
collect, store, convey, treat and use
or dispose each sanitation product.

30
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:48,760
a sanitation system is always built
using technologies

31
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,370
from these five different functional groups.

32
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,490
But remember;

33
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,500
not every system requires a technology
from each functional group.

34
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,040
This systematic thinking can help us
to organise and plan

35
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:04,540
the most appropriate system for
a given context.

36
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,960
During an acute humanitarian crisis,

37
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,810
it is not always possible to implement

38
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:11,950
a complete sanitation system from
the beginning.

39
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:14,470
We learned about the sphere minimal standards

40
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:18,460
that help us to understand the minimum
requirements of excreta management

41
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:21,730
during an acute humanitarian crisis.

42
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,770
The first goal is to create
an environment free from human faeces

43
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,260
in order to prevent the spread
of fecal oral diseases

44
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:33,240
such as diarrhea, typhus, and cholera.

45
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,270
The second goal is to provide
toilet facilities

46
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:39,010
in order for all affected people
to have adequate,

47
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:44,970
appropriate and acceptable toilets
that are safe and secure to use.

48
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:50,120
The case study from Liberia presented
an example of safe containment of excreta

49
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:54,220
with liquid waste that is contaminated
with Ebola.

50
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,470
There, we also saw that safe sanitation
goes beyond toilets

51
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,520
and that safe conveyance and treatment
are crucial.

52
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,520
The video also displayed the key
importance of community involvement

53
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:11,950
in the awareness raising during
such an intervention.

54
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,260
As there is no one-size-fits-all solution
to sanitation

55
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,260
and there is a high variability
of different contexts,

56
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:21,270
we looked at the criteria that influenced
the selection

57
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:25,230
of the most appropriate sanitation system
for a given context.

58
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:28,940
For this, we need to consider
the properties of the natural,

59
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:31,940
built and enabling environments

60
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:35,730
in order to make a well-informed choice.

61
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:37,510
In the second part of the week,

62
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,500
we got to know different suitable
sanitation technologies

63
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,970
for an acute humanitarian response

64
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:46,510
as well as collection, storage
and treatment technologies.

65
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,760
We saw how they work;

66
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,500
and what are their advantages
and disadvantages are.

67
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,740
If you want to learn more about different
sanitation technologies,

68
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,920
I would recommend our other
Eawag online course on sanitation planning

69
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:03,000
as well as reading the compendium
of sanitation systems and technologies

70
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,480
and other literature by other institutions.

71
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,280
You will find these links on the course page.

72
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:12,970
One example of the technology in the field

73
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,510
was seen in the case study of prisons
in Rwanda.

74
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:19,000
There, biogas toilets were implemented;

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,770
and the gas from the biogas toilets
is used for cooking in the prison.

76
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:28,520
If you want to learn more about sanitation
in humanitarian crisis,

77
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,260
please check out the literature
mentioned on the course page.

78
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,960
I hope you learned a lot this week

79
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:37,780
and are excited to test a new knowledge
in your working environment.

80
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,020
Let's provide improved sanitation

81
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,980
like done in the picture behind me,
in Ivory Coast.

82
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,270
So if you have any questions or feedback,

83
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,260
if you want to let us know about something,

84
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,200
please get back to us on the forum

85
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,980
and let us know your thoughts.

86
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,480
Thank you very much for your attention
during this week;

87
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:58,810
and I hope to see you again.
