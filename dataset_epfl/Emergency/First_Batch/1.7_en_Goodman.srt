1
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,670
In this video, we will talk about
water quantity requirements.

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:09,670
What are they?

3
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:15,750
There is not a straightforward and universal
answer, it really depends on the context.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,429
In order to assess what the water needs are, we
need to answer the following questions:

5
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:23,070
What is water needed for?

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:29,890
How much is needed and how do we have access
to it?

7
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:33,540
Obviously, life without water is not possible.

8
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:41,280
It is crucial to ensure health benefits. Adequate
quantity of water can also be crucial to ensure

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:47,641
livelihood such as in the picture taken in
Darfur in Sudan here where this water point

10
00:00:47,641 --> 00:00:51,580
is also crucial to water the cattle.

11
00:00:51,580 --> 00:00:57,059
Availability of water is also vital for some
cultural and religious practices.

12
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,190
The list of water uses can be very long and
competition of water between these different

13
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:04,500
uses and users exist.

14
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:09,780
It should be taken into account
in the assessment of water needs.

15
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:19,960
If we focus on public health aspect, water
is needed for drinking, cooking, washing clothes,

16
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:27,710
cleaning building, waste disposal such as
sanitation and personal washing.

17
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:33,350
The amount of water needed for these different
uses greatly varies depending on many factors

18
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:39,140
such as the local habits, climate or
sanitation technology used.

19
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:44,159
For instance for the toilets, in some contexts
you flush your waste and you need a high amount

20
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:52,140
of water and in other contexts, you don't need
water because you just do it above the pit.

21
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:57,230
In humanitarian assistance, most organizations
agree upon a minimum standard that is contained

22
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:00,189
in this book called “The Sphere Project”.

23
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:03,399
It also contains other standards for other
core humanitarian activities.

24
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,970
This book is free on the Internet so don't
hesitate, go, read it, check it, it is extremely

25
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:10,680
important.

26
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:15,880
According to the sphere project standards,
in humanitarian assistance at least 15

27
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,110
litres per day per person is required for
basic survival water needs.

28
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:27,980
It includes 3 litres per day per person
for drinking, 6 litres per day per person

29
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,800
for basic hygiene practices, and 6 litres
per day per person for cooking.

30
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,920
But be careful, these figures should be considered
as a minimum standard for survival and that

31
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:46,430
is during a very acute emergency generally
and not as a satisfactory situation.

32
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:51,900
Indeed priority should be given to quantity
while respecting quality in order to tackle

33
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,100
water-washed diseases that are due to the
lack of water for hygiene purposes.

34
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:03,440
If you look at the figures from the W.H.O.
you will see that with 20 litres per day

35
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,370
per person you should ensure drinking and
cooking needs and very basic hygiene needs.

36
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:16,510
However, it will be very difficult to ensure
laundry and bathing and other hygiene needs.

37
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:23,880
As such, the level of health concerns remains
high and that due to the risk of spread of

38
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,260
infectious diseases.

39
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:32,220
In order to lower these risks to less concerning
levels, at least 50 litres per day per

40
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,420
person would be needed according to the W.H.O.

41
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:41,709
Providing adequate quantity of water at the
water point does not guarantee that people

42
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:43,590
will have access to it.

43
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,810
As part of the assessment of water needs we
also have to look at the various obstacles

44
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,769
to this access.

45
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:51,230
Is it safe to access to it?

46
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:54,680
Can we access fully at any time?

47
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:57,199
Does everyone have access to it?

48
00:03:57,199 --> 00:04:01,620
Especially the most vulnerable. Is the water
point accessible to everyone?

49
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,890
For instance, can a disabled
person access to it?

50
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:08,780
Is it affordable for the poorest?

51
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:15,590
Finally, time to get to the water point is
also very important.

52
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:22,160
As a matter of fact, time to collect water
will depend on the time to get to water point

53
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,060
which many depends on the distance,

54
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,980
the time to wait at the water point which
can be very long especially when there is

55
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,850
not enough water points and people have to
queue.

56
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:40,930
The time to fill the container which depends
on the flow of the tap, and finally the time

57
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:44,010
to go back home.

58
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:50,750
As shown in this graph, as a consumer if
you have directly access to multiple taps at home you

59
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:55,510
should not have to wait to get access to water,
then you should actually get access to a very

60
00:04:55,510 --> 00:04:57,640
large quantity of water.

61
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:04,300
If water is delivered very close to your house,
usually less than one hundred meters, and that

62
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:10,140
you don't have to wait more than five minutes
to collect water, it is estimated that you

63
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,460
should be able to get access up
to 50 litres per day.

64
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:21,390
However, if you have to walk between let's
say one hundred and one kilometre to the water

65
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:29,980
point or it takes you between 5 to 30
minutes it is unlikely that you will get access

66
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:34,220
to more than twenty litres per day.

67
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:40,720
Then the longer the time the less the quantity
of water you get.

68
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,620
Let's summarize this video on water quantity
requirements.

69
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:48,140
We have seen that different population have
different uses for water and purities regarding

70
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,180
the location of water uses.

71
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:54,780
Therefore, the needs and demands should be
taken into account to defend the quantity

72
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:55,890
that is vital.

73
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:01,770
50 litres per day per person is a minimum
standard agreed by most humanitarian organization

74
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:07,680
for survival but we have seen that it is not
sufficient to stop the transmission of diseases.

75
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:13,770
Therefore in order to achieve a significant
health benefit, an increase of water availability

76
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:19,480
is required and finally we have seen that
access constraints should not be overlooked.

77
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,330
It will affect the quantity of water that
can be consumed.
