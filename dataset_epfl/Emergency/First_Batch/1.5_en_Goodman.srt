1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,270
Is this glass of water safe to drink?

2
00:00:09,270 --> 00:00:13,920
Good question huh? So in order to answer this
very important question you are going to

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:15,849
see this video.

4
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:20,970
What are the standards to be used? What are
the main criteria to be used? And finally,

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,029
we'll talk about water quality analyses.

6
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:30,130
In any case, you must ensure that the quality
of water supplied complies with the national

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,440
water quality regulation in the country where
you are working.

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,910
In the absence of recognised national standards
you can refer to the values and recommendation

9
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,040
contained in the W.H.O. water quality guidelines.

10
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:47,690
These guidelines are available for free in
the Internet so don't hesitate, go on and consult

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:49,710
them.

12
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:55,850
Three main criteria are used in W.H.O
guidelines to assess if water is fit for human

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:59,160
consumption.

14
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,920
The microbiological quality, it is usually
the primary concern in humanitarian context

15
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:12,139
because the presence of some pathogens can
cause an acute effect on large number of people

16
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:13,799
in the short term.

17
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:22,130
Therefore, a bad microbial quality represents
a high risk of epidemics.

18
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,420
Some chemical components occurring in the
water supply can also be harmful.

19
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,030
They are usually a health concern after long
exposure.

20
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:35,810
The principal exception is nitrate.

21
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,799
Chemical contamination can be man-made due
to industrial or agricultural activities for

22
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,600
instance but some contaminants can also
naturally occur in the ground.

23
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:53,630
At a global scale, fluoride and arsenic are
the most significant chemicals each affecting

24
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:55,950
perhaps millions of people.

25
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:00,939
However, many other chemicals can be important
contaminants of drinking water under specific

26
00:02:00,939 --> 00:02:04,100
local conditions.

27
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:09,340
Organoleptic criteria are related on
how water looks, smells and tastes.

28
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:13,939
It is not necessary because a glass of water
is not fully transparent or smells or tastes

29
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:21,150
slightly that water is harmful but organoleptic
criteria play an important role in the acceptance

30
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:23,709
of the product by the consumer.

31
00:02:23,709 --> 00:02:29,540
In an emergency for instance, if people do
not trust the water quality they may change

32
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,900
to alternative sources which are less safe.

33
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:39,019
Obviously, water quality that is needed to
say water is fit for human consumption but

34
00:02:39,019 --> 00:02:43,730
it is also needed to evaluate the quality
of a water source when you have to select

35
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:45,040
one.

36
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,120
Some parameters such as the conductivity,
nitrate, iron are often collected.

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,569
Some data are often needed to design
the treatment required.

38
00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:00,540
For instance, the turbidity and the ph value
will impact directly the chlorination.

39
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:05,950
Therefore depending on the turbidity and the
ph, a pre-treatment before the chlorination

40
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:07,159
may be needed.

41
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:15,189
Data are also needed to control water treatment
process such as the residual chloride.

42
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:20,489
Finally data may also be needed to protect
the water distribution systems against corrosion.

43
00:03:20,489 --> 00:03:24,400
However, be careful with water analyses.

44
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:32,780
It is only a snapshot which gives a single result
at a given time and a given location.

45
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:37,969
Some parameters can vary strongly, for instance
in some context turbidity and faecal pollution

46
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:41,620
increase more often in rainy season.

47
00:03:41,620 --> 00:03:46,530
And some microbial and chemical parameters
can be easily measured in the field with specifically

48
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:49,489
designed portable laboratory and equipment.

49
00:03:49,489 --> 00:03:54,599
However, not all the parameters can be measured
like that.

50
00:03:54,599 --> 00:04:01,219
Some analyses require specific equipment in
laboratory and however, due to the lack of

51
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:04,709
resources not all laboratories are reliable.

52
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:11,030
This is why complimentary investigations are
required, local knowledge including medical

53
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:14,319
information is very valuable.

54
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:21,390
As well as a good understanding of water resources
through hydrogeological studies for instance.

55
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:28,350
Finally, sanitary survey and assessment of
risk of contamination are needed.

56
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:35,320
For further information you can refer to the
W.H.O. water safety plans, W.S.P., which are

57
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,280
quite comprehensive.

58
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,880
So to answer to our initial question is this
glass of water safe to drink?

59
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:51,590
Remember that we should look at three parameters,
the microbial, chemical and organoleptic.

60
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:56,720
National regulation defines the acceptable
values for these different parameters.

61
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:00,220
W.H.O. recommendations can also be used as a guideline.

62
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:05,280
You can measure the different parameters and
some of them with portable equipment.

63
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:11,540
However, do not forget that an analysis is
just a snapshot of the quality at a given

64
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:14,820
time and at a given location.

65
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:20,460
You should monitor quality over time and continually
assess the risk of contamination from the

66
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,140
source to your glass.

67
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:33,070
Meanwhile cheers and see you in the next video
that you will learn a lot about that of course.

68
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:35,880
Hoping that this water was safe.
