In this video, we will talk about water quantity requirements.
What are they?
There is not a straightforward and universal answer, it really depends on the context.
In order to assess what the water needs are, we need to answer the following questions:
What is water needed for?
How much is needed and how do we have access to it?
Obviously, life without water is not possible.
It is crucial to ensure health benefits. Adequate quantity of water can also be crucial to ensure livelihood such as in the picture taken in
Darfur in Sudan here where this water point is also crucial to water the cattle.
Availability of water is also vital for some cultural and religious practices.
The list of water uses can be very long and competition of water between these different uses and users exist.
It should be taken into account in the assessment of water needs.
If we focus on public health aspect, water is needed for drinking, cooking, washing clothes, cleaning building, waste disposal such as sanitation and personal washing.
The amount of water needed for these different uses greatly varies depending on many factors such as the local habits, climate or sanitation technology used.
For instance for the toilets, in some contexts you flush your waste and you need a high amount of water and in other contexts, you don't need water because you just do it above the pit.
In humanitarian assistance, most organizations agree upon a minimum standard that is contained in this book called â€œThe Sphere Projectâ€�.
It also contains other standards for other core humanitarian activities.
This book is free on the Internet so don't hesitate, go, read it, check it, it is extremely important.
According to the sphere project standards, in humanitarian assistance at least 15 litres per day per person is required for basic survival water needs.
It includes 3 litres per day per person for drinking, 6 litres per day per person for basic hygiene practices, and 6 litres per day per person for cooking.
But be careful, these figures should be considered as a minimum standard for survival and that is during a very acute emergency generally and not as a satisfactory situation.
Indeed priority should be given to quantity while respecting quality in order to tackle water-washed diseases that are due to the lack of water for hygiene purposes.
If you look at the figures from the W.H.O. you will see that with 20 litres per day per person you should ensure drinking and cooking needs and very basic hygiene needs.
However, it will be very difficult to ensure laundry and bathing and other hygiene needs.
As such, the level of health concerns remains high and that due to the risk of spread of infectious diseases.
In order to lower these risks to less concerning levels, at least 50 litres per day per person would be needed according to the W.H.O.
Providing adequate quantity of water at the water point does not guarantee that people will have access to it.
As part of the assessment of water needs we also have to look at the various obstacles to this access.
Is it safe to access to it?
Can we access fully at any time?
Does everyone have access to it?
Especially the most vulnerable. Is the water point accessible to everyone?
For instance, can a disabled person access to it?
Is it affordable for the poorest?
Finally, time to get to the water point is also very important.
As a matter of fact, time to collect water will depend on the time to get to water point which many depends on the distance, the time to wait at the water point which can be very long especially when there is not enough water points and people have to queue.
The time to fill the container which depends on the flow of the tap, and finally the time to go back home.
As shown in this graph, as a consumer if you have directly access to multiple taps at home you should not have to wait to get access to water, then you should actually get access to a very large quantity of water.
If water is delivered very close to your house, usually less than one hundred meters, and that you don't have to wait more than five minutes to collect water, it is estimated that you should be able to get access up to 50 litres per day.
However, if you have to walk between let's say one hundred and one kilometre to the water point or it takes you between 5 to 30 minutes it is unlikely that you will get access to more than twenty litres per day.
Then the longer the time the less the quantity of water you get.
Let's summarize this video on water quantity requirements.
We have seen that different population have different uses for water and purities regarding the location of water uses.
Therefore, the needs and demands should be taken into account to defend the quantity that is vital.
50 litres per day per person is a minimum standard agreed by most humanitarian organization for survival but we have seen that it is not sufficient to stop the transmission of diseases.
Therefore in order to achieve a significant health benefit, an increase of water availability is required and finally we have seen that access constraints should not be overlooked.
It will affect the quantity of water that can be consumed.
