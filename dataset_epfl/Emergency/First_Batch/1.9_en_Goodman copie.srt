1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,900
Nowadays it's normal to think that the plague
no longer exists.

2
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:17,430
But in countries like Congo Kinshasa and Madagascar,
people die from this highly contagious disease

3
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,720
every year.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,470
In Madagascar, people are still becoming infected
and the chance of a major outbreak has not

5
00:00:24,470 --> 00:00:26,720
gone away.

6
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,150
Prisoners, often in overcrowded and unhygienic
prisons, share their quarters with hundreds

7
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:37,680
of rats and disease carrying fleas.

8
00:00:37,680 --> 00:01:19,509
Although, the spread of
plague from rats via fleas to people

9
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:30,810
has been prevented in prisons,

10
00:01:30,810 --> 00:01:51,579
the same can’t be said for the
rest of the country.

11
00:01:51,579 --> 00:02:10,539
In rural areas, there is

12
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:25,170
little understanding

13
00:02:25,170 --> 00:02:53,680
of the plague, often it is something to be
ashamed of and covered up.

14
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:25,530
As a result, not all cases are reported to
the authorities by this vulnerable population

15
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:49,280
spread out across a vast territory.

16
00:03:49,280 --> 00:04:18,790
Rafred's daughter, [Maoli], is buried on the hill
close to the town centre,

17
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:49,450
where she died two years ago.

18
00:04:49,450 --> 00:05:02,820
The grave is located 30 kilometres away from
her village.

19
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:16,280
Rafred won’t be able to retrieve his daughter’s
body until 2017 after observing a seven year

20
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:20,160
period imposed by the health authority.

21
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:21,810
Without steps to monitor and
check the spread of

22
00:09:21,810 --> 00:10:02,770
the disease, the plague is

23
00:10:02,770 --> 00:12:30,260
a danger

24
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:41,990
to

25
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:47,630
public health that can quickly get out of
hand. But the government has adopted a national

26
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:50,310
strategy to fight the disease.

27
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:55,380
They now keep national statistics for every
case of the plague recorded in Madagascar

28
00:12:55,380 --> 00:13:01,370
which is then passed on to the World Health
Organization and with ICRC support, the

29
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:20,680
prevention campaign in prison goes on.

30
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,680
The challenge of this campaign is not to stop
in one single prison in the capital,

31
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:24,680
but to develop these preventive measures
across Madagascar.

32
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,680
and to get the entire prison system signed up
to this campaign, run by the authorities.
