00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:05,740
Congratulations !

2
00:00:05,740 --> 00:00:07,180
You have completed this introduction

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,960
on Public health engineering
in humanitarian context.

4
00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:12,240
During our journey,

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,250
we have seen that populations affected 
by humanitarian crisis are particularly at risk

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:19,380
of infectious diseases;

7
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:25,750
which unfortunately remain a major cause of 
mortality and morbidity in this context.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,730
Public health engineers alongside
with medical workers

9
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:32,220
and food security experts,
play an important role

10
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:35,940
to tackle these diseases and save lives.

11
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,960
Public engineers contribute to stop

12
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:39,990
the transmission of hazards in
the environment

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:42,980
through the provision of adequate
drinking water supply,

14
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:45,250
proper excreta management,

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,710
solid waste management,

16
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:49,260
effective vector control interventions,

17
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,510
and hygiene promotion campaigns.

18
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:55,850
Based on a good understanding
of the environmental transmission

19
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,260
pathway of diseases,

20
00:00:57,260 --> 00:01:00,260
public health engineers can put
multiple barriers

21
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,760
to prevent the creation of Hazard;

22
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:02,530
its transport;

23
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,720
and the people from being exposed to it
once encountered.

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,960
Thanks to the different lectures
and case studies,

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,930
we have also seen during this course,

26
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,240
different technologies encountered
in humanitarian context.

27
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,780
There is never a one-size-fits-all.

28
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,260
Engineering measures 
should be adapted to the context.

29
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:27,010
Intervention could range from
a shallow trench latrine

30
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:31,250
up to a complex wastewater
treatment plant.

31
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:33,520
During this course, we've also seen that

32
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,810
there are an increasingly number
of humanitarian crisis

33
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:39,990
that tends to be more and more
complex

34
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:42,490
often played out in urban settings,

35
00:01:42,490 --> 00:01:47,420
longer in duration and broader
in regional impact.

36
00:01:47,420 --> 00:01:50,520
In order to address this unprecedented
humanitarian needs,

37
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,910
humanitarian response needs absolutely
to adapt and innovate.

38
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,900
And this is why, well trained and motivated
engineers

39
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,520
and specialists in water sanitation, 
energy supply, and environment,

40
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:07,490
and in other related fields are increasingly
needed.

41
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,600
On behalf of all the lecturers of this course,

42
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,960
we hope that you enjoy it and
you are learned a lot.

43
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,990
Thank you for your participation.

44
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:17,990
And we hope to see you soon;

45
00:02:17,993 --> 00:02:19,524
but in the field.

46
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:22,756
See you soon !
