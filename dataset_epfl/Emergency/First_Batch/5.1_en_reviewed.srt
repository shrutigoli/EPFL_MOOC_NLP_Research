1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,480
Welcome to this last week of the course.

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:08,762
Over the last two weeks,

3
00:00:08,762 --> 00:00:10,530
we talked about water supply,

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:14,060
excreta management and vector control.

5
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:17,530
Our journey in the public health
engineering in humanitarian context

6
00:00:17,530 --> 00:00:20,970
will not be completed without
two important activities

7
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,976
that we talk about during this week.

8
00:00:23,976 --> 00:00:29,130
They are solid waste management
and hygiene promotion.

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:32,760
The accumulation of refuse such as
in this picture taken in Syria

10
00:00:32,760 --> 00:00:35,790
can pose serious public health risks.

11
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:39,000
Indeed, refuse attracts flies, mosquitoes,

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,230
cockroach, rats and other insects and rodents,

13
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:44,510
which can transmit disease to man.

14
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,740
Diseases such as fecal oral diseases or plagues

15
00:00:47,740 --> 00:00:51,470
as we have seen over the last weeks of this course.

16
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:54,940
Burning waste in the street
which often happen

17
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,470
when essential services as distrupted,

18
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,960
can also cause harmful smoke emissions.

19
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,960
In addition to health risks,

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,780
uncollected solid waste also create
an unpleasant environment.

21
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:10,970
Finally, solid waste inappropriately managed

22
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,720
can harm the environment by polluting
surface water and groundwater.

23
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:20,920
This is why adequate solid waste
management is so important.

24
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:23,220
There are different types of waste.

25
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:26,480
But during this week,
we'll focus only on one type

26
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,490
that public health engineers often encounter
in humanitarian crises.

27
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,500
This is the medical waste.

28
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,971
If you would like to know more about
solid waste management in general,

29
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:41,720
I recommend you to sign up to
the EAWAG mooc on olid waste management

30
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:46,480
which give a comprehensive picture
of this complex challenge.

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:47,940
To end this week,

32
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:51,730
we'll discuss the critical issue
of behavior change

33
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:55,510
and hygiene promotion in humanitarian
context.

34
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:58,000
Indeed, as we have seen during week 1

35
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,740
with the example of the fecal oral
diseases,

36
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:04,250
adequate hygiene practices
can contribute significantly

37
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:08,990
to reduce the risk of disease transmission
and epidemics.

38
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:13,770
However, changing people behavior
is not at all an easy matter.

39
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:17,250
This is what you will see
with Professor Mosler, from EAWAG

40
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,750
who is an expert in that field.

41
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,860
Enjoy your last week !
