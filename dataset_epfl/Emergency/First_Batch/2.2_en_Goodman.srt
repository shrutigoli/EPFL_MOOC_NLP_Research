1
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:10,440
You are carrying out a field assessment and
based on your findings it is clear that a humanitarian 

2
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:18,761
crisis is occurring and an urgent intervention
is required. What should you do first? Should

3
00:00:18,761 --> 00:00:25,850
you rush for addressing critical issues? No.
Before you start to address critical issues

4
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:31,230
you need to first formulate the strategy on
how to resolve these issues and achieve like

5
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,300
that the desired results. Hitting straight
into implementations without conducting relevant

6
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,690
analysis to determine technical feasibility,
resources and cost involved and other factors

7
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:47,031
could lead to failure in resolving the issue.
This is why during this course, you

8
00:00:47,031 --> 00:00:54,010
will get familiar with the so called Result
Based Management approach (R.B.M.) and learn

9
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:57,579
to identify the different steps of
the projects item.

10
00:00:57,579 --> 00:01:04,640
A significant proportion of humanitarian projects
have failed to respond adequately to the needs.

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,119
Some evaluations carried out found that the
main causes of failure where due to poor planning

12
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,029
and preparation. They highlight it in particular
that many projects where not relevant to the

13
00:01:15,029 --> 00:01:20,790
beneficiaries, risks where insufficiently
taken into account and factors affecting the

14
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:27,709
longer term sustainability of project benefits
where often ignored. This is why many organisations

15
00:01:27,709 --> 00:01:34,520
have adopted specific management strategies
such as the result based management or R.B.M.

16
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:40,740
to address these issues. R.B.M. is to manage
an intervention while trying to ensure its

17
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:47,429
relevance, efficiency, effectiveness, impact
and other quality criteria. In other words,

18
00:01:47,429 --> 00:01:53,560
the R.B.M. approach implies a shift in focus
away from the actions to be carried out towards

19
00:01:53,560 --> 00:02:00,970
the consequences of the actions. In the R.B.M.
logic, resources or inputs are used to carry

20
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:11,190
out activities. These activities produce specific
outputs. An example of output could be a percentage

21
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:17,319
of a targeted population in a given location
have access to sufficient number of functioning

22
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:25,400
sanitation facilities within reasonable proximity
and in line with local criteria standards.

23
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:33,150
Outputs are the immediate effects of an activity.
Several outputs produce outcomes which are

24
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:40,569
the likely or achieved major term effects of
an intervention output. An example of outcome

25
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:46,930
could be that in a given area, a certain number
of displaced people are protected against

26
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:53,609
the major environmental health hazards related
to water quality, water quantity, hygiene

27
00:02:53,609 --> 00:03:02,530
and sanitation. Outcomes contribute to impacts.
Impacts are the long term effect of an intervention.

28
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:10,090
They can be positive or negative, intended
or unintended. An example of impact of an

29
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:15,709
interventions could be that the prevalence
of diseases linked to the environmental factors

30
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:21,939
in the displaced population is no greater than
that of the general population in the region

31
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:29,880
in peace time. In order to maximise the chances
of achieving the desired outputs, outcomes

32
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:38,660
and impacts, the R.B.M. recommends following
four main steps presented here in this item.

33
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:45,730
The first step is the assessment and the analysis.
In this step you collect qualitative and quantitative

34
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:51,370
data through a field assessment. Analyse the
data along with the information gathered from

35
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:57,060
your stakeholders’ conversation to identify
the highest purity urgent issues. The aim

36
00:03:57,060 --> 00:04:03,010
of an assessment is to understand the situation
in order to identify the problems, the source

37
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,640
of the problems and the consequences of the
problems.

38
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:14,370
There are different type of assessments. The needs
assessment does not aim to identify an intervention but to

39
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:20,860
find out whether or not an intervention is
required based on identified needs. Such assessment

40
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:27,449
should at least provide information on who
is affected or concerned by certain issues,

41
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:35,139
how many people are affected or concerned?
Where are they located? What are the issues?

42
00:04:35,139 --> 00:04:42,560
Why are they affected or concerned? You should
gather info on the courses, risk and vulnerabilities,

43
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,550
coping capacities and finally how will the
situation evolve.

44
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:52,830
Another type of assessment is the feasibility
assessment which aims to identify the possibility

45
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,810
of undertaking a given humanitarian action
such as implementing an engineering project.

46
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:04,470
It focuses on the factors likely to affect
directly or indirectly the implementation

47
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:10,960
and the success of the project. In such assessment,
you have to gather information on the enabling

48
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:17,800
environment such as the regulations, the capacity
of the service providers, information on the

49
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,900
features of the area, the state of infrastructure
and other relevant technical information needed

50
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:27,699
to carry out the project.
In the second step, you have to formulate

51
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:33,039
clear objectives based on context analysis
and your assessment and you should describe

52
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:39,699
measurable intended results. You should assess the feasibility
of your project. Particularly, attention should

53
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:46,270
be paid to the future operation and maintenance.
You have to plan activities and resources required

54
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:54,099
to accomplish the objectives. Then, based
on your plan of actions you could implement

55
00:05:54,099 --> 00:06:02,379
your project.
Finally, you conduct evaluation and review

56
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:08,259
lessons learned from success or failure to
achieve intended results. According to the

57
00:06:08,259 --> 00:06:13,560
results, you might have to restart the cycle.
Don’t forget that throughout the life of

58
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,051
the project, you should monitor and follow
up the activities in order to adapt the project

59
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:24,650
according to the evolution of the situation.
To summarise, there are many constraints in

60
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:30,729
the management of humanitarian projects such
as the lack of data and uncertain future. Urgent needs.

61
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:36,479
However, rushing to the implementation is
likely to result in inadequate projects to

62
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:42,409
address critical needs. The project management
cycle is a sequence of logic steps to help

63
00:06:42,409 --> 00:06:48,250
you to maximise the benefits of programmes
for the beneficiaries. You assess, think,

64
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,300
plan, do and review.
Of course, in practice, the duration and importance of

65
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:59,280
each phase of the cycle will vary depending
on the context. Nevertheless, ensuring that

66
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,569
adequate time and resources are committed
to project identification and formulation

67
00:07:04,569 --> 00:07:10,710
is critical to support the design and effective
implementation of relevant and feasible projects

68
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,729
for the beneficiaries.
Now let’s see some concrete examples of

69
00:07:14,729 --> 00:07:20,419
the different steps of project management.
In the next two videos, some ICRC engineers will

70
00:07:20,419 --> 00:07:25,500
share with you their experience of managing
programmes in rural environment and in an

71
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:26,240
emergency.
