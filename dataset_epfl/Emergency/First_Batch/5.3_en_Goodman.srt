00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:09,730
Welcome to this video on medical waste
management. The first of two on this topic.

2
00:00:12,390 --> 00:00:15,220
Health care facilities are a means to
protect public health by treating patients

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:23,280
and controlling the associated spread of infection.
This generates waste which needs to be managed and such activity

4
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,360
entails some risks.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:33,830
Medical waste management is a set of measures to address those risks.
In this first video, we will focus on data to be

6
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:41,910
collected in order to design a proper medical waste management
system. You will learn how to identify medical waste

7
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:48,120
risks, how to classify different types of medical waste
and finally how to estimate their production.

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,910
If you deal with medical waste, you will usually start with
something like this. Normal waste mixed with dressing,

9
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:02,420
needles, vials and sometimes some anatomical parts.
It can quickly transform into something like this.

10
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:07,620
Or something more insidious. In these
pictures, years of wild dumping

11
00:01:07,630 --> 00:01:10,960
have formed a series of layers of
needles, catheter, plastic

12
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,600
and sharp objects, something that you might
happily discover when you start a building site

13
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:25,330
or something even more treacherous. Look at this picture.
These kids are dredging the bed of this urban channel to sell

14
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:32,780
at the market fine sand for plastering purpose. The problem is that
they are downstream the main hospital in town where

15
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:40,830
x-ray development liquid is dumped directly into the sewage.
Such liquid contains something that is called absorbable

16
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:46,200
organic iodinated compound which is
toxic to both human and animal

17
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,780
and can contain formaldehyde,
a known human carcinogen.

18
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:56,670
And of course you will also deal with
the waste area where incineration happens

19
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:03,510
and where a lot of smoke is produced. Usually
something not particularly appreciated by the neighbouring communities.

20
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:09,930
And of course activities should be controlled,
otherwise quite serious accidents might occur.

21
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:22,120
Trying to be a bit systematic, medical waste can
be meaningfully divided into categories based on the level of risk

22
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:30,960
associated as it is done in this WHO table.
Thanks to such a distinction, it becomes clear that

23
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,970
medical waste management is first and
foremost a set of risk mitigation practices.

24
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:44,720
This is the point defining the public health
to full scope of medical waste management.

25
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:53,950
The contamination risk associated to infectious waste
is properly contained inside the hospital site.

26
00:02:55,020 --> 00:03:02,780
All the hospital users and the communities
around the health care facilities are kept safe along the process.

27
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:11,020
In fact, medical waste products can provide
the vector for the transmission of infection both inside

28
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:13,470
and outside the perimeter of an health care facility.

29
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:24,810
This chart illustrates the relation between the sources,
the environment, the vector of transmission related to medical

30
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:27,710
waste that helps the spreading of infection.

31
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:37,030
Maybe at this point, it's also important to state what
medical waste management is not. It is not cleaning or hygiene

32
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:44,120
promotion. Yes of course the activities are
all related, they concur to the overall same objective

33
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:48,550
but it is important to stress that it is the specific

34
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:56,260
and unique scope of infection risk reduction imbedded into
waste management. Multiple medical waste solutions can be

35
00:03:56,270 --> 00:04:04,000
proposed. The best will always be the one that reduces
the overall risk of infection for all the community of users

36
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:04,880
involved.

37
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:14,730
OK, now after some theory let's try to be a bit more
operational. Let's classify medical waste in a way that is

38
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:19,140
functional to how we deal with it. Of course
it is easier to see than to do.

39
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,400
The nature of their waste products, their

40
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,770
treatment requirements, their occurence

41
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:29,260
or not in a given context, have created quite a
lot of different classifications.

42
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,700
Here we see the one used by
or not in a given context, have created quite a
lot of different classifications.

43
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:30,750
or not in a given context, have created quite a
lot of different classifications.

44
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:34,920
the ICRC. This is the one from M.S.F.
And finally the one from W.H.O.
or not in a given context, have created quite a
lot of different classifications.

45
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,580
the ICRC. This is the one from M.S.F.
And finally the one from W.H.O.

46
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:46,450
At the end really, there is no conceptual difference,
it is just a matter of terminology. For this video I will use

47
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:52,250
the terms proposed by the W.H.O. Sharps,
infectious and pathological wastes

48
00:04:52,900 --> 00:05:00,850
and for simplicity, I will call chemical waste everything
referring to pharmaceutical, cytotoxic, chemical

49
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:07,880
and radioactive waste. Waste quantity varies a lot
according to the  count. This W.H.O.

50
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:17,110
chart shows how total medical waste, the squares, and
the infectious one, the dots, vary according to their gross national income.

51
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:26,090
As you see we are talking about a variability
that spans from six, even eight kilos per bed per day to just one.

52
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:37,300
Another factor is the type of health facility you
are considering. The table here, also from a W.H.O.

53
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:44,680
publication, illustrates for three different countries
the evident waste production rate per type of facility

54
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:47,900
and as again you can see a really big variation.

55
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:55,800
So at this point something is clear. If you have a real
work case the best thing to do is to start a measure campaign

56
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:04,000
to know how much weight is actually produced. A waste mapping
exercise or a category and per quantity. Each waste product

57
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:06,660
should be identified, where it is produced

58
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:14,590
and now it moves within the hospital. Here is the result of such
a mapping exercise for sharps. Here is for infectious

59
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,150
and pathological wastes.

60
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:21,000
For example, you can see how the operating
theatre, the dot in the middle of the plan, is a big

61
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:29,870
producer in this category. And finally, chemical waste.
In this case, the biggest producers are the lab and the radiology department.

62
00:06:31,510 --> 00:06:38,270
In conclusion, to recapitulate this video, we can say
that there are different ways of classifying medical wastes.

63
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:47,470
But what really matters is the risk associated to each category.
The quantity of waste produced in an healthcare facility

64
00:06:47,830 --> 00:06:51,600
depends on the level of medical care
and the type of facility concerned.

65
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:58,960
Among the quantity produced, about
10 to 25% is considered hazardous medical waste

66
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:07,810
or special waste. This entails significant potential health
risk. The rest is considered as general waste similar to a

67
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:13,870
household waste. Given the high variability of
data, quantity should be measured

68
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:15,150
and not estimated.

69
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,680
Finally, the assessment should also
include where the waste is produced.

70
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:26,110
Based on all this information, we can look
on how to implement a medical waste management system.
