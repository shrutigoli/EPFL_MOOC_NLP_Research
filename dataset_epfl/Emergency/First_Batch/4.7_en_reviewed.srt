00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:10,540
As Liberia looks towards
the nebular free future,

2
00:00:10,540 --> 00:00:12,530
a serious challenge remains:

3
00:00:12,530 --> 00:00:15,250
safely removing ebola waste.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:17,280
I.C.R.C. is leading the way.

5
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,990
Specialized, these lodging trucks
delivering to this site

6
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,960
in the capital on Monrovia;

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,290
The only site in liberia capable of 
safety storing and handling Ebola waste.

8
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,492
We had to put in place a system

9
00:00:32,492 --> 00:00:35,792
which ensures that all the Ebola liquid waste

10
00:00:35,792 --> 00:00:39,948
is treated safely.

11
00:00:39,948 --> 00:00:48,518
All workers have to wear personal
protective equipment.

12
00:00:48,518 --> 00:00:51,558
We also ran 5 or 6 training sessions

13
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:58,028
on pumping water as well as
emptying truck.

14
00:00:58,028 --> 00:01:01,218
Workers must follow safety guidelines
scrupulously.

15
00:01:01,218 --> 00:01:06,728
to avoid any spillage
as they decouple the holes.

16
00:01:09,918 --> 00:01:13,570
Local people are kept well away
from the site.

17
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,768
From the onset of the project,

18
00:01:21,768 --> 00:01:24,490
the community was in a lot of fear.

19
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:26,460
mainly what you hear about Ebola.

20
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,960
We recruited from the community

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,520
to serve as monitors.

22
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,000
We were trained and then came back
to our community

23
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,000
and explained to them the safety protocol

24
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,019
and that measure would be put in place

25
00:01:37,019 --> 00:01:39,249
So that the fear of the community dwellers

26
00:01:39,249 --> 00:01:40,664
could be wiped away.

27
00:01:45,694 --> 00:01:48,270
We go from door to door

28
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,990
telling them that the people 
are bringing Ebola waste here

29
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:54,300
but it's safely treated.

30
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,026
Yes the people believe us

31
00:01:56,026 --> 00:01:57,788
because we are in the field.

32
00:01:57,788 --> 00:01:59,985
We are their eyes,

33
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:04,195
so what we see, we tell them.
