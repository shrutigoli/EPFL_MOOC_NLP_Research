1
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,920
Iraq, the cradle of civilization. 

2
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,490
The Tigris and Euphrates rivers join to form
the Shatt al-Arab waterway.

3
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:25,880
But despite this massive water course, the
region is essentially a desert.

4
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:31,219
The supply of water has always been a problem
for the Iraqis.

5
00:00:31,219 --> 00:00:36,410
The series of wars and the ten year embargo
have blocked plans to develop modern efficient

6
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,210
water delivery systems.

7
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:46,970
This film is intended to give an account of
ICRC’s effort to combat the widespread deterioration of Iraq’s

8
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,970
infrastructure.

9
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:51,750
But recent events unfortunately got the upper
hand.

10
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,500
The latest round of conflict hit Iraq like
a tidal wave undermining all attempts to meet

11
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,510
the essential needs of civilians.

12
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:04,930
A task which, according to the Geneva Convention,
is the responsibility of the occupying power.

13
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:19,221
Now more than ever, water plays a critical
role in the resolution of the crisis.

14
00:01:19,221 --> 00:01:23,650
The ICRC has been present in Iraq carrying
out its humanitarian mandate for over twenty

15
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:25,720
two years.

16
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,729
At the time of the Gulf war twelve years ago, the situation
reached catastrophic proportions and the ICRC

17
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:36,120
stepped up its activities extending its far
reach in water and sanitation program.

18
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:41,520
The objective has remained unchanged throughout
the years in this extremely difficult

19
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,310
context, to provide the civilian population
with a clean safe drinking water which is

20
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,230
essential for life.

21
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:52,880
In one conflict after another, major elements
of the electrical power networks were destroyed

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:57,430
resulting in the dropping capacity in the
water treatment plants and pumping stations.

23
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:02,909
If there is no electricity, you will see how
everything is here.

24
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:03,909
Everything depends on electricity.

25
00:02:03,909 --> 00:02:07,940
If there is no electricity the whole plant
is going to stop.

26
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:12,250
Half of Baghdad will have no drinking water,
nothing.

27
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:18,090
The lack of spare parts, qualified help and
logistical equipment hasten the general deterioration

28
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:21,700
of Iraq’s infrastructure.

29
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:26,080
The sewage treatment and disposal system is
on the point of collapse and often reach its

30
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,470
full capacity.

31
00:02:27,470 --> 00:02:34,450
The threat to public health is constant.

32
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:39,490
Waste is regularly discharged untreated into
waterways. The long term consequences for

33
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:44,620
the environment and public health are no less
than a time bomb.

34
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:49,650
Most members of the population already worn
down by the direct or indirect effect of ten

35
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:55,080
years of embargo also suffer from a shortage
of safe drinking water.

36
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:59,209
Recent conflicts have only aggravated the
situation while completely blocking the supply

37
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:02,060
of humanitarian aid.

38
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:07,130
The ICRC’s humanitarian activities over
the past twelve years in Iraq developed in

39
00:03:07,130 --> 00:03:09,500
several stages.

40
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:15,700
During the 1991 Gulf war, the ICRC focused
its efforts on emergency water distribution.

41
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:21,810
Tanker trucks and mobile water purification units
succeeded in providing the population with

42
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,510
temporary relief.

43
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:30,670
But it was necessary to adapt to the changing
situation.

44
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:37,560
From 1991 to 1993, after an embargo was imposed
by the U.N, the ICRC contributed actively

45
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:46,070
to repair work on water installations by providing
desperately needed spare parts.

46
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:52,110
But from 1994 to 1997, in view of the alarming
deterioration of the water and sanitation

47
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:56,700
services and the logistical difficulties faced
by local officials,

48
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:03,190
the ICRC had to take some of the maintenance
and repair work into its own hands.

49
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:08,360
The program became more complex involving needs
assessment, financial resources and technical

50
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:11,670
know-how.

51
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:22,250
In 1998, the entry into force of the U.N’s
all for food resolution made access to spare

52
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,250
parts easier.

53
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:35,680
The Iraqi authorities could once again deal
directly with foreign supplies.

54
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,729
The procedures for buying spare parts remained
long and tedious and not enough supplies could

55
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:43,099
be imported to deal with the situation.

56
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:51,169
The ICRC was therefore obliged to take on an

57
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:56,189
even bigger role which nevertheless remained
complimentary to local water boards.

58
00:04:56,189 --> 00:05:05,169
The ICRC gave priority to sewage treatment
plants, but it also worked to upgrade medical

59
00:05:05,169 --> 00:05:16,219
facilities that could no longer provide essential
health care services.

60
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:21,860
Complimenting the easing of restrictions under the U.N’s
oil for food resolution, ICRC was able

61
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:25,809
to slow the inevitable deterioration of Iraq’s
water supply system.

62
00:05:25,809 --> 00:05:31,520
But the great majority of Iraqis are still
forced to live with chronic shortages of safe

63
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,520
drinking water.

64
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,930
The existing supplies constantly threatened
by water-borne diseases which the existing

65
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:42,860
health care facilities are unable to treat
effectively.

66
00:05:42,860 --> 00:05:48,819
The situation worsened during the recent war.

67
00:05:48,819 --> 00:05:53,310
In March 2003, the ICRC was the only humanitarian
organization to remain in the country throughout

68
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,059
the conflict.

69
00:05:57,059 --> 00:06:06,180
Thanks to its experience on the ground, sustained
relationships with the water boards and credibility,

70
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:11,050
the ICRC remained effective in an extremely
hostile environment which included not only

71
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,409
the violence of the fighting but also destructive
looting.

72
00:06:15,409 --> 00:06:21,840
Although water treatment facilities suffered
little direct harm, damage to the power supply

73
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:26,440
caused major cuts in water supply from the
very first hours of the conflict.

74
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:33,289
People had to manage as best as they could
to get to the water they needed.

75
00:06:33,289 --> 00:06:41,080
The immediate challenge for the ICRC is
to intervene without delay in areas where

76
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:45,479
epidemics of infectious diseases
are a real risk.

77
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:52,080
The ICRC has played a unifying and catalyzing
role between the occupying forces administration

78
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,800
and Iraqi professionals.

79
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,439
But effective work depends on maintaining
security and restoring a fully functional

80
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:08,520
local administration, both are the responsibilities
of the occupying power.

81
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,840
The ICRC’s tireless efforts are ensuring
that it can play a vital role in the reconstruction

82
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,159
of Iraq during the post war period.

83
00:07:16,159 --> 00:07:23,020
But beyond emergency measures, the ICRC’s
main concern would be to ensure that the supply of clean

84
00:07:23,020 --> 00:07:28,629
water can be guaranteed in a long term and
sustainable way through cooperation with Iraqi

85
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:32,369
water and health authorities and companies.

86
00:07:32,369 --> 00:07:36,959
Only a rigorous self sufficient local economy
will bring about a durable improvement in

87
00:07:36,959 --> 00:08:01,559
the situation, ensuring quality water and sanitation
services for everyone.
