1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:10,550
There are hundreds, maybe thousands of organisms
which can cause water-borne diseases.

2
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:15,740
One useful way to classify these pathogens
is by biological type.

3
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:20,220
In this module, we will briefly talk about
four different classes of pathogens. The most

4
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,180
important ones are the protozoa, bacteria
and viruses but we will also give an example

5
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:32,710
of one helminth or parasitic worm which is
transmitted through drinking water.

6
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:37,410
The first thing to know about pathogens is
that they are small but human hair is about

7
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,730
0.1 millimetres or 100 microns
in diameter.

8
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:48,150
Protozoa, the largest class of pathogens, are
much smaller, usually about 10 to 50 microns

9
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,870
in size.

10
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:56,170
Protozoa are one-cell eukaryotes, that means
that their cell has a nucleus unlike prokaryotic

11
00:00:56,170 --> 00:00:59,310
cells such as bacteria.

12
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:04,899
Some protozoa can form an egg like cyst to
survive harsh conditions such as exposure

13
00:01:04,899 --> 00:01:12,390
to extreme temperature, chemicals or long periods
without water or food.

14
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:20,520
Many protozoa are parasites and cause diseases
like malaria and giardia. Here you see entamoeba histolytica

15
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,780
and cryptosporidium parvum, both of which can
cause severe diarrhea.

16
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:30,619
Entamoeba is the cause of amoebic dysentery
or bloody diarrhea.

17
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:35,540
This disease affects adults more than
children and only about 10-20% of those

18
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:38,869
infected with entamoeba develop symptoms.

19
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:43,479
It is estimated to cause more than a hundred
thousand deaths per year.

20
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:48,590
Recent studies have shown that cryptosporidium,
commonly called crypto, is one of the leading

21
00:01:48,590 --> 00:01:51,630
causes of diarrheal disease among children.

22
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:58,850
A large and important research project, the
Global Enteric Multicenter Study or GEMS has found

23
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:04,829
it to be the second most commonly isolated
pathogen among children with diarrhea, after

24
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:08,030
rotavirus.

25
00:02:08,030 --> 00:02:12,540
Cryptosporidium-form cysts which are about
5 microns in diameter and are highly resistant

26
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,090
to treatment.

27
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:21,760
The first human cases of crypto were reported
in 1976 and the disease became infamous in

28
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:28,000
1993 when an outbreak occurred in the northern
US city of Milwaukee.

29
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:32,040
Cryptosporidium overwhelmed the treatment
plants filtration system and chlorine has

30
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,640
no effect on crypto.

31
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,260
Over two weeks, 400,000 people
became ill and over 100 deaths were

32
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:44,640
caused mainly in people with compromised immune
systems.

33
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:47,500
Cryptosporidium is a major cause of death
among people with HIV/ AIDS.

34
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:55,349
The infectious dose for cryptosporidium and
other protozoa is low, even a single cyst can

35
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:59,130
cause disease.

36
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:04,120
Bacteria are organisms of a few microns in
size and of varying shapes such as spheres,

37
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,180
rods or spirals.

38
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:12,739
They are prokaryotes which means that, unlike
the protozoa, they do not contain a nucleus.

39
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:19,030
Bacteria are everywhere growing in soil, in
the deep ocean and even in acidic hot springs.

40
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:26,459
A gram of soil or a millilitre of water can
contain several million bacterial cells.

41
00:03:26,459 --> 00:03:31,489
Although the vast majority of bacteria are
harmless or even beneficial to humans a few

42
00:03:31,489 --> 00:03:37,800
can cause diseases such as cholera, trachoma
or salmonella.

43
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,790
Here you see the E. coli and vibrio cholera
bacteria.

44
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:47,480
They, like most bacteria, are about 1 or
2 microns in size.

45
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:53,000
E. coli is universally found in human and
animal faeces but is normally not pathogenic.

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:04:00,830
In fact, E. coli is the preferred indicator
bacteria used to demonstrate faecal contamination.

47
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:04,470
However some strains of E. coli do cause disease.

48
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:10,709
These are called pathogenic E. coli and one
group of these pathogens is the enterotoxigenic

49
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:18,310
E. coli or E-Tec. The GEMS project found E-Tec to be
among the top five pathogens isolated from

50
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,800
children with diarrhea and affects particularly
small infants.

51
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,180
The other bacterial pathogen most commonly
found by GEMS was shigella, a distant relative

52
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,770
of E. coli.

53
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:36,479
Together, shigella and E.coli are thought
to cause up to one third of the diarrheal

54
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,379
disease mortality globally.

55
00:04:39,379 --> 00:04:44,300
Vibrio cholera causes the terrifying disease
cholera.

56
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:49,300
It can spread very rapidly under the right
conditions and can cause severe diarrhea and

57
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:53,240
death within hours if not treated.

58
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:58,819
Cholera thrives in conditions where there
is crowding and poor sanitation and hygiene.

59
00:04:58,819 --> 00:05:06,680
Outbreaks can occur after natural disasters,
in refugee camps and in peri-urban slums.

60
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:11,960
There are an estimated 3 to 5 million
cholera cases and 100,000 to

61
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:17,800
120,000 deaths due to
cholera every year.

62
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:23,159
The smallest of the pathogens are the viruses
which are typically 0.1 microns, that is the

63
00:05:23,159 --> 00:05:29,509
same as 100 nanometers, or even smaller
in diameter.

64
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:34,839
Viruses don't have an independent metabolism
they can only grow or reproduce within a living

65
00:05:34,839 --> 00:05:39,469
host cell and cannot multiply within the environment.

66
00:05:39,469 --> 00:05:46,659
Many viruses are host specific, causing disease
in humans or specific animals only.

67
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:52,550
Rotaviruses and Hepatitis A and E viruses
are the most widespread water-borne viruses

68
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:55,319
affecting humans.

69
00:05:55,319 --> 00:06:03,770
Here you see rotavirus at about 75 nanometres and hepatitis
E which is quite small at about 30 nanometres.

70
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,270
You could line up thousands of hepatitis E
viruses and still be smaller than a human

71
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,430
hair.

72
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:16,159
Rotavirus is one of the main pathogens causing
diarrheal disease.

73
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:21,500
The GEMS project found rotavirus to be the
single most commonly isolated pathogen among

74
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:23,900
children with diarrheal disease.

75
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,729
It is particularly prevalent among
the youngest children.

76
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,199
Infected people shed large numbers of the
virus in their faeces, approximately 10 to

77
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,159
the 11 viruses per gram of faecal matter.

78
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:40,379
That is a hundred thousand of millions.

79
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:45,809
The viruses are highly effective, only ten
to a hundred virus particles are needed to

80
00:06:45,809 --> 00:06:48,710
cause infection.

81
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:54,379
Rotavirus was estimated to cause over five
hundred thousand deaths each year in 2004

82
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:58,969
with more than 85% of these
deaths occurring in low income countries in

83
00:06:58,969 --> 00:07:03,779
Africa and Asia.

84
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:09,159
Hepatitis A is spread through food, water
or direct contact with infected people.

85
00:07:09,159 --> 00:07:12,599
Hepatitis E is mainly spread through drinking
water.

86
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,319
Both diseases are widespread in the developing
world, in countries with poor sanitation and

87
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:23,199
hygiene nearly all children are infected before
the age of ten.

88
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,999
Every year there are over 3 million acute
cases of hepatitis E and over 50,000 deaths

89
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:35,459
related to hepatitis E.
Finally, although it is nearly eradicated,

90
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:39,270
polio remains an important water borne virus.

91
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:49,360
There were only 223 cases reported in 2012
down from some 350,000 cases in 1988.

92
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:55,770
Only three countries remain polio endemic;
Afghanistan, Nigeria and Pakistan but as long

93
00:07:55,770 --> 00:08:01,410
as a single child remains infected, children
in all countries are at risk.

94
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:08,509
Water sanitation and hygiene play an important
role in eliminating polio.

95
00:08:08,509 --> 00:08:13,789
From the smallest of pathogens to the largest,
the helminths or parasitic worms which can

96
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:17,789
invade human intestines or other tissues.

97
00:08:17,789 --> 00:08:22,619
Most helminth transmission is due to poor
sanitation hygiene but one particularly nasty

98
00:08:22,619 --> 00:08:26,740
helminth is mainly transmitted through drinking
water.

99
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:31,069
This is dracunculus medinensis or guinea worm.

100
00:08:31,069 --> 00:08:37,069
Its larvae live in fresh water and are eaten
by small aquatic insects called coppa pods.

101
00:08:37,069 --> 00:08:42,360
The larvae are tiny but the coppa pods are
big, typically about 1 millimetre and visible

102
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,030
to the naked eye.

103
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,870
Once a person drinks water containing the
coppa pods, hydrochloric acid in the stomach

104
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:57,370
kills the insect and releases the larvae which
mature and grow into adult worms.

105
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,790
These can reach a length of nearly a metre
and be as wide as a spaghetti noodle.

106
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:08,440
The worms migrate through the body and emerge
through the skin often near the feet.

107
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:13,180
The worm has to be removed slowly winding
it up and pulling it out of the body bit by

108
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,850
bit over weeks.

109
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:22,480
This is extremely painful, it creates sores
and blisters and people often soak their feet

110
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,250
in water to relieve the pain.

111
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:30,600
The worm then discharges hundreds of thousands
of larvae into the water completing the transmission

112
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,069
cycle.

113
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:38,160
Major progress has been made towards eliminating
guinea worm.

114
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:44,300
Since 1986, the global eradication campaign
has been led by the Carter Centre in close

115
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:49,470
collaboration with W.H.O., the C.D.C. and UNICEF.

116
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:56,570
The number of reported cases has dropped from
3.5 million in 1986 to just 542

117
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:59,089
in 2012.

118
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:06,269
As of 2012, it is found only in a few hundred
villages in remote rural areas mostly in south

119
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:12,620
Sudan with a handful of cases in Ethiopia,
Mali and Chad.

120
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:18,620
Once guinea worm is eradicated, it will be
the only second human disease ever eradicated

121
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:20,330
after smallpox.

122
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:27,370
Unless of course polio is eradicated first,
which seems unlikely.

123
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:32,510
And unlike smallpox, guinea worm will be beaten
without vaccines or drugs through community

124
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:37,980
scale interventions which involve protection
and treatment of drinking water.

125
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:43,329
Because the coppa pods hosts are large they
can be readily removed from water, using simple

126
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:47,500
cloth or sand filters.

127
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,080
So in summary, we have covered four main types
of pathogens today.

128
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:55,600
We have talked a little bit about helminths
with the example of dracunculus or guinea worm

129
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:01,519
disease which is transmitted through these
very large coppa pods around a millimetre

130
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:03,300
in diameter.

131
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:08,860
The next biggest are the protozoa such as
entamoeba, cryptosporidium and giardia which

132
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:14,040
are 10 to 50 microns in diameter and can
form very resistant cysts.

133
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:20,820
Then we have got the bacteria such as E.coli,
shigella, vibrio cholera which are 1 or

134
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:29,319
2 or 3 microns in size and can cause
serious diarrhea and then finally the smallest

135
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:35,279
class is the viruses, rotavirus, hepatitis,
polio virus which are even smaller than a

136
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,909
micron as small as thirty nanometres in size.
