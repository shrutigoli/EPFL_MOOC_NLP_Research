00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:11,480
Today's armed conflict and resulting 
humanitarian crises

2
00:00:11,487 --> 00:00:13,987
are increasingly complex.

3
00:00:13,987 --> 00:00:16,250
There are greater in number.

4
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,270
often in urban settings;

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,920
longer in duration;

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,000
and broader in regional impact.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,240
They generate human suffering
on a greater scale;

8
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,990
disrupt essential services;

9
00:00:29,990 --> 00:00:32,510
such as water supply or sanitation

10
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:36,030
and put health of large populations at risk.

11
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:39,300
[Music]

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,492
In order to tackle these challenges,

13
00:00:41,492 --> 00:00:43,290
engineers and technical specialists

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,230
in water, sanitation,

15
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,940
electricity, environment

16
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,230
and other related fields,
play a vital role.

17
00:00:50,230 --> 00:00:51,513
In the humanitarian sector,

18
00:00:51,513 --> 00:00:53,786
they are called the public health 
engineers;

19
00:00:53,786 --> 00:00:56,760
and today they are increasingly needed.

20
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,410
Why is the public health engineering essential

21
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,250
in humanitarian crisis ?

22
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,960
And how are related activities carried out
in such a complex environment?

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,233
This is what this mooc is all about.

24
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:12,750
This mooc brings you expertise

25
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,270
of EAWAG scientists in water
and sanitation

26
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:22,290
and the humanitarian experience
of I.C.R.C Public health engineers.

27
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,270
In addition,

28
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,710
this mooc features a certain number
of real case studies

29
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:30,780
for you to gain a concrete
and pragmatic understanding

30
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,210
of the humanitarian challenges.

31
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:36,810
So interested to know more?

32
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,990
Are you interested to know

33
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:41,250
how you could use your technical
and engineering skills

34
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:45,724
to alleviate suffering of people 
afflicted by humanitarian crisis?
