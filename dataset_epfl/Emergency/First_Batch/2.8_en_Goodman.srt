00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:08,210
Congratulations! You made it through week
two about the humanitarian context. 

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,760
I hope you get a better understanding of these

3
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:12,100
challenging environments.

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:18,400
During this week, we have seen that the
humanitarian system is complex with many stakeholders

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:19,840
not always coordinated.

6
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:30,720
Despite that, they are increasingly challenged, especially
in current conflicts. Humanitarian principles that are impartiality,

7
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:37,290
neutrality, independence and humanity must remain a
reference tool to guide humanitarian actions.

8
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:45,850
During this week, we have also seen that in a humanitarian context,
despite urgent needs, you should not rush to the

9
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:53,300
implementation of activities. Such behavior is likely to result
in inadequate projects to address critical needs.

10
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:58,640
You should ensure that adequate time and resources
are committed to assess and analyze the needs

11
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:04,440
and formulate a strategy in order to design effective
and relevant projects for the beneficiaries.

12
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:12,850
The project management cycle is a sequence of logic steps
to help you to maximize the benefits of project for the

13
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:19,090
beneficiaries. Humanitarian action has been
mainly designed to respond to the needs in acute

14
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,150
emergencies

15
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:28,710
and in rural environments. However nowadays we see
an increase in number of protracted conflicts that take place in

16
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,810
urban environments. It poses new challenges.
Indeed, people in urban

17
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:39,760
contexts rely on essential services.
The services are beyond the technical capacity

18
00:01:39,770 --> 00:01:45,680
and the direct physical control of the residents.
It affects the resilience of the inhabitants.

19
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:55,710
These essential services such as water supply,
power supply, sanitation are interconnected, no electricity, no water.

20
00:01:56,900 --> 00:02:03,740
This interconnectivity between essential services
needs to be understood and properly integrated into humanitarian

21
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:06,760
actions in order to avoid counterproductive effects.

22
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:13,960
Urban services require three elements
in order to function: people, hardware

23
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:18,590
and consumables.
Disruption to an essential service occurs

24
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:24,490
when the functions of any of the critical
people, hardware or consumables are compromised.

25
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:31,870
These three components can be affected
by direct, indirect and cumulative impacts.

26
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,800
Direct impacts such as damages to infrastructure
from explosive munitions attract the most attention

27
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:44,870
but field experiments suggest that the
cumulative impact is the most destructive

28
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,910
and the most difficult to recover from.

29
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:54,230
Humanitarian response in urban areas is
a major challenge of today's humanitarian crisis.

30
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,470

can be found in this ICRC publication.
