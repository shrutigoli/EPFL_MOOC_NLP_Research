1
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:07,590
Unfortunately,
around the world, huge amounts

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:12,670
of waste water and sludge end up
untreated into rivers, lakes,

3
00:00:12,673 --> 00:00:16,718
and into the sea.
What does it take to treat them?

4
00:00:16,718 --> 00:00:19,014
I will now introduce you
to the centralized

5
00:00:19,014 --> 00:00:22,471
and semi-centralized
treatment technologies.

6
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:26,239
The treatment process can be
divided into several stages.

7
00:00:26,239 --> 00:00:29,796
The pre-treatment,
the primary treatment,

8
00:00:29,796 --> 00:00:33,800
the secondary treatment,
the tertiary treatment,

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:37,930
or post-treatment.
Within these categories,

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,309
some technologies are based
on biological processes:

11
00:00:41,309 --> 00:00:44,769
aerobic, anaerobic or both.

12
00:00:44,775 --> 00:00:47,805
And some others on
physical, chemical ones.

13
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:49,770
In this module,
we'll have a look

14
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,527
at the different
treatment stages

15
00:00:51,527 --> 00:00:54,506
and then focus on
pre- and post-treatment,

16
00:00:54,506 --> 00:00:56,930
which can be implemented in any system.

17
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:57,975
The learning goals

18
00:00:57,995 --> 00:01:00,043
of this series of modules
on treatment are:

19
00:01:00,043 --> 00:01:03,473
get to know the different
treatment technologies,

20
00:01:03,508 --> 00:01:06,725
understand the different
treatment stages and processes,

21
00:01:06,725 --> 00:01:09,077
and understand
the different functions

22
00:01:09,077 --> 00:01:14,271
of the treatment technologies.
Let's start. First, let's review

23
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:17,968
the different treatment stages.
The two main treatment stages

24
00:01:17,968 --> 00:01:22,238
are called primary and secondary.
"Primary treatment" consists

25
00:01:22,249 --> 00:01:27,911
in the liquid/solid separation.
For example, through sedimentation.

26
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:31,027
As for the "Secondary treatment",
it consists of the removal

27
00:01:31,027 --> 00:01:33,935
of organic matter
and suspended solids.

28
00:01:33,935 --> 00:01:36,754
The "pre-treatment" is
the preliminary removal

29
00:01:36,754 --> 00:01:40,244
of waste water or sludge
constituents, such as oil,

30
00:01:40,244 --> 00:01:44,815
grease and various solids,
like sand and trash.

31
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:48,268
Pre-treatment is a must.
On the other hand,

32
00:01:48,268 --> 00:01:51,283
the "tertiary treatment"
and "post-treatment"

33
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:54,653
consist of removing elements
like remaining pathogens,

34
00:01:54,653 --> 00:01:57,966
nutrients such as nitrogen
and phosphorous,

35
00:01:57,966 --> 00:02:01,096
or micropollutants
from the effluent.

36
00:02:01,442 --> 00:02:05,764
Tertiary treatment embraces
a large spectrum of technologies,

37
00:02:05,764 --> 00:02:09,553
and most of them are not implemented
in low- and middle-income countries.

38
00:02:09,553 --> 00:02:12,785
Too expensive and too complex.

39
00:02:12,785 --> 00:02:15,766
Let's have a look at a few
pre-treatment technologies.

40
00:02:15,766 --> 00:02:18,743
Pre-treatment is a preliminary
removal of waste water

41
00:02:18,743 --> 00:02:22,269
or sludge constituents,
either before conveyance,

42
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:23,980
or before treatment systems.

43
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,790
It is meant to prevent
the accumulation of solids

44
00:02:26,803 --> 00:02:30,943
in further stages and avoid blockages.
It can also help produce abrasion

45
00:02:30,944 --> 00:02:33,714
of mechanical parts
and extend the life

46
00:02:33,735 --> 00:02:36,771
of sanitation infrastructure.
Pre-treatment technologies

47
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:44,441
use physical removal mechanisms
such as screening, flotation, settling,

48
00:02:44,452 --> 00:02:46,276
and filtration.

49
00:02:46,276 --> 00:02:51,546
"Screening" is used, for example,
in the screens to prevent trash

50
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:54,928
and coarse solids to end up
in the sewerage system

51
00:02:54,928 --> 00:02:57,517
or the treatment plant.
"Flotation" is used,

52
00:02:57,517 --> 00:03:00,527
for example, in grease traps
and grids interceptors

53
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:04,507
to remove the fats, oil and grease.

54
00:03:06,232 --> 00:03:09,912
Finally, "settling" is used,
for example, in the sand trap,

55
00:03:09,912 --> 00:03:17,781
or grit chambers, to remove
the heavier solids.

56
00:03:19,101 --> 00:03:23,061
As you can see in this figure,
grease traps and grit chambers

57
00:03:23,061 --> 00:03:26,719
can be combined
in one technology.

58
00:03:26,719 --> 00:03:29,417
On the other end of
the treatment process,

59
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:32,819
there are different possibilities
to polish the effluent:

60
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:36,203
the so called post-
treatment technologies.

61
00:03:36,203 --> 00:03:39,514
Depending on the design
and use of the effluent,

62
00:03:39,514 --> 00:03:42,937
or on national standards
for discharging water bodies,

63
00:03:42,937 --> 00:03:44,989
a post-treatment step
may be required

64
00:03:44,989 --> 00:03:48,853
to remove pathogens,
residual suspended solids,

65
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:50,966
or its soil constituents.

66
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:53,923
This can be mainly achieved
through tertiary filtration

67
00:03:53,923 --> 00:03:55,768
and disinfection techniques.

68
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,974
Filtration process
can be classified

69
00:03:57,974 --> 00:04:01,505
in two categories:
first, the depth,

70
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:04,973
or "packed-bed filtration",
as shown in this figure,

71
00:04:04,973 --> 00:04:08,517
where the effluent passes
through a filter medium,

72
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:11,037
such as sand
or activated carbon.

73
00:04:11,037 --> 00:04:13,945
On the other hand,
“surface filtration“

74
00:04:13,945 --> 00:04:17,783
removes undesired elements
through sieving; for example,

75
00:04:17,783 --> 00:04:19,005
through membranes.

76
00:04:19,005 --> 00:04:22,244
As for "disinfection", its target
is the elimination

77
00:04:22,244 --> 00:04:24,757
of pathogenic micro-organisms.

78
00:04:24,757 --> 00:04:27,280
Chlorine is the most
widespread technique.

79
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,274
Chlorine is mixed with effluent
at the outset of the treatment plant,

80
00:04:31,274 --> 00:04:35,024
as shown in this figure,
with a chlorine diffuser

81
00:04:35,024 --> 00:04:36,853
and a chlorine mixer.

82
00:04:36,853 --> 00:04:41,483
You can also do disinfection
through UV radiation or ozonation,

83
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:43,944
the two being more
energy intensive.

84
00:04:43,944 --> 00:04:47,158
However, you have to be
cautious with disinfection.

85
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:50,036
For example, chlorine together
with organic matter

86
00:04:50,036 --> 00:04:53,715
can form toxic byproducts,
harmful for the environment.

87
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:57,555
It should thus only be applied
if strictly necessary.

88
00:04:57,555 --> 00:05:01,766
You don't want to create more
problems than you actually solve.

89
00:05:01,766 --> 00:05:06,004
To sum up, we saw that treatment
is a succession of different steps,

90
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:09,731
the main ones being the primary
and secondary treatment.

91
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:13,305
Pre-treatment is a must,
as a kind of preventive measure,

92
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:16,732
either at the household level,
at the street level,

93
00:05:16,732 --> 00:05:19,741
or at the inlet
of a treatment plant.

94
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:21,921
Post-treatment is
not always necessary,

95
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:25,011
and a pragmatic approach
is recommended.

96
00:05:25,011 --> 00:05:27,517
The effluent quality should
match the intended end use

97
00:05:27,517 --> 00:05:31,957
practice, or the quality
of the receiving water body.
