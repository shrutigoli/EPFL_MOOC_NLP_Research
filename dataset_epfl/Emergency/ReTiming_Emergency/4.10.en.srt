1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:07,920
Now we will look
at the aerobic technologies,

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:10,440
which can be used
as stand-alone systems

3
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:13,530
or to polish the effluent
of anaerobic units.

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:19,370
Aerobic systems are biological systems
which rely on the action of bacteria

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:22,630
needing oxygen to live, like us.

6
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:27,110
Thus, in all of them
oxygen provision is a key aspect.

7
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:31,980
Without sufficient oxygen,
the environment becomes anaerobic,

8
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,550
which leads to processes
such as described in the last module.

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,470
Some aerobic technologies
try to imitate nature,

10
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:43,340
such as the "waste stabilization ponds",
or the "constructed wetlands".

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,910
Some of these are more engineered,

12
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,900
such as the "trickling filter"
or the "activated sludge".

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,520
Let's start with the waste
deposition ponds, or lagoons.

14
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,820
It is a system that consists
in a succession of ponds

15
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,890
with different functions.

16
00:00:59,890 --> 00:01:05,680
First one anaerobic pond,
then one or two facultative ponds,

17
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,500
and finally, one or two
maturation ponds.

18
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:11,690
Let's look in more detail
at the differences

19
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:13,470
between these three types of ponds.

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:18,620
The anaerobic pond is the deepest,
with a depth of two to five meters,

21
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,210
and also the smallest.

22
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:23,200
It is highly loaded
because it receives the rawest water.

23
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,300
The anaerobic pond has a hydraulic
retention time from one to three days,

24
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,060
and its main function is sedimentation

25
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:35,430
and anaerobic stabilization
of sludge, thus, settling.

26
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:39,210
The facultative pond or facultative ponds

27
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,220
if they are several, are shallower.

28
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:45,830
Usually, less than 1.5 meters,

29
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:47,110
but large.

30
00:01:47,110 --> 00:01:50,230
The idea here is to maximize
the oxygen supply

31
00:01:50,230 --> 00:01:53,880
either through algae,
wind, or artificial aeration.

32
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,620
The hydraulic retention time there

33
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:58,060
is longer: from ten to twenty days.

34
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:01,420
Here, the main function
is the aerobic degradation

35
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,160
of suspended and dissolved matter,

36
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,360
thus, degradation.

37
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,280
Finally, the maturation ponds
are even shallower,

38
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,240
usually less than one meter, but large.

39
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,100
The hydraulic retention time
is about ten days.

40
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,280
Here the main function is the
final sedimentation of suspended solids,

41
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,270
the bacterial mass,
and pathogens, thus polishing.

42
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:31,770
Waste stabilization ponds
can treat high strength wastewater

43
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:33,720
to a high quality effluent.

44
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,290
They are generally reliable
and good functioning

45
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,660
and inexpensive, compared
to either centralized options.

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,140
However, they require a lot of space
and may generate bad odors,

47
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:49,680
especially the anaerobic pond,
if poorly designed.

48
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:52,910
It requires expert design and supervision,

49
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:55,520
especially to avoid short-circuiting,

50
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,430
in which case, the effluent

51
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:01,440
goes from the inlet to the outlet
without mixing properly,

52
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,750
that is, not staying through
the intended retention time.

53
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:08,860
Besides, if they work
at best in warm climates,

54
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:11,760
waste stabilization ponds
are not always appropriate

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,330
for colder climates.

56
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:17,780
This picture shows large
waste stabilization ponds

57
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,470
for the city of Cuenca, in Ecuador.

58
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,330
A way to increase the
performance of waste stabilization ponds

59
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,990
is to provide artificial aeration,

60
00:03:26,990 --> 00:03:28,970
which is done
in Cuenca in the first pond,

61
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,800
upstream of this picture.

62
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,120
It is also a good way
to upgrade the ponds

63
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,100
when then reach design capacity,

64
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,880
especially extension,
is not always easy.

65
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:42,200
In aerated ponds,
mechanical aerators provide oxygen

66
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,710
and keep the aerobic organisms suspended

67
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:47,380
to achieve a high rate
of organic degradation.

68
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:52,950
Increased mixing and aeration
means that the ponds can be deeper

69
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:56,130
and tolerate much higher organic loads
than the maturation pond.

70
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,550
The depth may be
from two to five meters

71
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:02,460
and a retention time
from three to twenty days.

72
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,420
In some cases,
it can even replace the anaerobic pond,

73
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:10,180
thus avoiding the bad odors
that anaerobic ponds may generate.

74
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:15,620
The downside of it is that aeration
implies a high energy consumption,

75
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:19,660
and thus costs, and requires
a constant source of electricity.

76
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:26,080
Interruption of electricity service
may cause the pond to turn anaerobic,

77
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:29,300
thus changing completely
the inner biological processes.

78
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:32,100
We will now have a look
at another family

79
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:35,040
of treatment technologies:
the "constructed wetlands".

80
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:39,670
"Constructed wetlands" aim to replicate
the naturally occurring processes

81
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:42,410
of a natural wetland, marsh or swamp.

82
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,330
We distinguish three types:

83
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,970
the "free water surface
constructed wetland",

84
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:51,830
the "horizontal subsurface flow
constructed wetland",

85
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:54,650
and the "vertical flow
constructed wetland".

86
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,130
Let's start with the "free water surface
constructed wetland".

87
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:03,100
In that case, the water
slowly flows through the wetland,

88
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,560
particles settle,
and pathogens are eliminated

89
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:12,320
through the combined action
of sun, settling, adsorption,

90
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,570
and predation from higher organisms.

91
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,160
The organisms and plants
utilize the nutrients.

92
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,220
This style of constructed wetland

93
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,930
is commonly used as a polishing step

94
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:26,060
after secondary
or tertiary treatment processes.

95
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:30,900
It is only appropriate
for low strength wastewater.

96
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:32,760
This is a really important fact.

97
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,950
The depth of the water
is ten to 45 cm above ground level.

98
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,460
Wastewater needs to be
well distributed at the inlet.

99
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:47,460
Good operation and maintenance is needed

100
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:51,020
for it not to turn
into a mosquito breeding area,

101
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,280
and to avoid short-circuiting.

102
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:57,640
Let's look now at the "horizontal
subsurface flow constructed wetland".

103
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:01,230
Its performance
regarding reduction of BOD,

104
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:03,460
suspended solids, and pathogens

105
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,500
is higher than in the freewater
surface constructed wetlands,

106
00:06:06,860 --> 00:06:08,870
and it does not have
the mosquito problem

107
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,230
as the water flows
only under the surface,

108
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:13,590
as its name indicates.

109
00:06:13,590 --> 00:06:15,950
As in the previous technology,

110
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:20,570
the good distribution of the influent
at the inlet is very important.

111
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:25,440
The gravel bed is between
50 cm and one meter deep.

112
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:32,900
The water level is maintained
at 5 to 15 cm below the surface.

113
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,370
As wastewater flows
horizontally through the basin,

114
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:42,380
the filter material
filters out particles.

115
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,120
It acts both as a filter
and as a fixed surface

116
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,310
upon which bacteria can attach,
forming large biofilms.

117
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:54,260
The plant roots play an important role

118
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,740
in maintaining permeability in the filter.

119
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,530
It is very important to have
a good primary treatment

120
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:03,400
before the wetland.

121
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:07,150
Otherwise, the risk of clogging
will be very high.

122
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,280
Expert follow-up is necessary
to monitor the plants,

123
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,230
especially the startup periods.

124
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:18,170
As a final remark,
we have to mention

125
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,820
that the wetlands need a lot of space,

126
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:25,470
generally a surface of about five to ten
square meters per person equivalent.

127
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,660
This picture illustrates
the last type of constructed wetland,

128
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,470
the "vertical flow constructed wetland",

129
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:35,410
which is, of course, difficult
to differentiate from outside.

130
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:40,750
This is the most sophisticated
and performance type of wetland

131
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:44,170
By injecting the wastewater
from above the whole surface,

132
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:46,550
the distribution is greatly improved.

133
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:51,160
The water flows down
and is collected by a drainage system.

134
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:56,750
The important difference
between vertical and horizontal wetlands

135
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:59,800
is not simply the direction
of the flow path,

136
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,810
but rather, the aerobic conditions.

137
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,500
The wastewater
is applied intermittently,

138
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:08,260
four to ten times a day.

139
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:14,080
Thus, the filter goes through stages
of being saturated and unsaturated,

140
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,870
and accordingly, different phases
of aerobic and anaerobic conditions.

141
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:21,830
With this regime,
there is less plugging risk

142
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:24,320
than in horizontal
subsurface flow wetland.

143
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,940
Other than that,

144
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,040
the treatment processes are the same
as in the horizontal flow wetland.

145
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,340
Because of the mechanical dosing system,

146
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:37,940
this technology is most appropriate
where trained maintenance staff,

147
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,100
constant power supply,
and spare parts are available.

148
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:45,900
Constructed wetlands
can reach a good performance

149
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,550
with processes close to nature.

150
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,160
However, one has to
be aware of the risk of clogging

151
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,010
and the management of the plants,

152
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,620
especially the startup and maintenance,

153
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,100
and beware high ammonia levels

154
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,870
which may prevent the plants
from growing properly.

155
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:06,490
In all cases, a good
primary treatment is crucial.

156
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:09,500
Before finishing this module,

157
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:12,390
we will look at two
higher end technologies

158
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,780
which we may call <i>Conventional</i>:

159
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:17,630
the "trickling filter",
and the "activated sludge".

160
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:21,900
These systems are really performant in developed countries,

161
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,030
but imply high capital costs,

162
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,730
operation and maintenance
by skilled personnel,

163
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,580
and a constant source of energy.

164
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:33,640
The "trickling filter"
is a fixed bed biological reactor

165
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:37,020
that operates mostly
under aerobic conditions.

166
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:42,050
After primary treatment,
wastewater is continuously trickled

167
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:47,380
or sprayed through the filter,
for example, through a rotating sprinkler.

168
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,840
Organics are degraded by
the biofilm covering the filter material.

169
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,440
The filter is usually
from one to 2.5 meter high,

170
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,060
but some filters may reach
a height up to 12 meters.

171
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:05,140
Adequate airflow is important
to ensure sufficient treatment performance

172
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:06,670
and prevent odors.

173
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:10,200
The air can circulate
vertically through the filter.

174
00:10:11,490 --> 00:10:15,160
The advantage of a trickling filter
over the technologies presented before

175
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,520
is the small land requirement;

176
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:22,060
however, flies and odors
are often problematic.

177
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:25,550
The "activated sludge system"

178
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,650
is the best known and
most widespread in Western countries

179
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:32,670
under different forms,
such as sequencing batch reactor,

180
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:37,270
oxidation ditches, moving beds,
or membrane bioreactors.

181
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,330
It makes use of
highly concentrated micro-organisms

182
00:10:40,330 --> 00:10:43,470
to degrade organics
and remove nutrients,

183
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,820
leading to a high quality effluent.

184
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:47,990
To maintain aerobic conditions

185
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:50,590
and to keep the activated
sludge suspended,

186
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,430
a continuous and well-timed
supply of oxygen is required.

187
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:59,420
Aeration and mixing can be provided
by pumping air or oxygen into the tank

188
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,310
or by surface aerators.

189
00:11:01,570 --> 00:11:04,870
Agglomerations
of sludge particles called <i>flux</i>

190
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,230
form in the aerated tank
and are removed in a settler

191
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,360
called in that case "<i>secondary clarifier"</i>.

192
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:15,800
We are now at the end of this module

193
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:17,760
on aerobic treatment technologies.

194
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:20,440
We saw very different technologies

195
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,230
that can all perform well,

196
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,770
but have different requirements.

197
00:11:24,770 --> 00:11:28,480
To sum up, we can say
that the main decision factors are:

198
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,090
the availability of space,
financial resources,

199
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:35,010
skills, and electricity.
