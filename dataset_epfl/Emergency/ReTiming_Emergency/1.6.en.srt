1
00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:08,090
Now you know about some of the specific
pathogens that can cause diarrheal

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:12,890
disease, and that most of these pathogens
originate in human or animal feces.

3
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,000
Well, there's so many different pathogens
that

4
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:19,070
it's impractical to try and measure them
all.

5
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:20,780
So what we do instead is we use

6
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:25,010
indicator species to indicate the presence
of fecal contamination.

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:28,660
Today we'll talk about those indicator
species.

8
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:32,500
It would be impractical and impossible
actually to directly

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:36,380
measure all the different pathogens that
could cause diarrheal disease.

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,520
So instead we look for indicator species

11
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,100
that can show the presence of fecal
contamination.

12
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:46,670
Some characteristics of an ideal fecal
indicator are that, it should be something

13
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,940
that's universally present in the feces of
both human and animals in large numbers.

14
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,060
Those numbers should be higher than the

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:56,060
actual numbers of the pathogens of
interest.

16
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,830
And the indicator should not be harmful or
pathogenic in itself.

17
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,230
It should be something that's readily
detected

18
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,060
using simple, inexpensive methods, and it
should

19
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:14,620
also persist in the environment, or water,
in a similar manner to fecal pathogens.

20
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:16,570
You wouldn't want it to actually grow in

21
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:21,270
natural waters because then you would get
misrepresentation.

22
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,790
And finally, if possible the indicator
should respond

23
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:28,090
to treatment in a similar fashion to
faecal pathogens.

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,380
One of the most common indicator species

25
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,360
is a bacteria class called total
coliforms.

26
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,130
Total coliforms are bacteria that can
ferment lactose

27
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,960
and produce acid and gas at 35 degrees
Celsius.

28
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,540
There are many different families of
coliforms.

29
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,470
Citrobacter, Klebsiella, Hafnia, and
Enterobacter.

30
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:55,430
And for this reason, total coliforms is
not really useful as

31
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:59,440
a fecal indicator, because many of these
bacteria have non-fecal sources.

32
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,760
However total coliforms can be useful

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,220
for operational monitoring to demonstrate
for example

34
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:08,690
the effectiveness of treatment or overall

35
00:02:08,690 --> 00:02:12,060
cleanliness and integrity in a
distribution system.

36
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,090
Thermotolerant coliforms as their name
applies can tolerate heat

37
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,590
and these are subset of the total coliform
class.

38
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:26,990
Thermotolerant coliforms are what used to
be called faecal coliforms, and

39
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:31,060
they can ferment lactose within 48 hours
at 44 degrees Celsius.

40
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,100
Feces contain a large number of
thermotolerant coliforms, but

41
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,900
there are some indications of non-faecal
sources of thermotolerant coliforms.

42
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,660
Such as klebsiella and some species of
enterobacter.

43
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,070
Also there's evidence that thermotolerance
under some conditions can

44
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,860
grow or die off in water at ambient
temperatures.

45
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:57,730
So it's not a bad indicator, but it has
some limitations.

46
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:02,580
Escherichia coli, or E. coli, is

47
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,850
one specific species of Thermotolerant
Coliforms

48
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,520
that is generally agreed to be the most
suitable indicator of fecal contamination.

49
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:14,460
There's some possibility that E. coli might

50
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:18,020
grow in the environment in tropical
settings.

51
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,800
And it's only moderately persistent.

52
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,780
So the absence of E. coli

53
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,180
doesn't necessarily mean the absence
of faecal contamination.

54
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:29,640
However, on balance, considering all the
different

55
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,860
ideal characteristics some indicator
bacteria, E. coli

56
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:36,350
is considered to be the best
available option.

57
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,860
Indicator bacteria are usually reported in
terms of the

58
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,940
number of counts or colonies in a 100 mL
sample.

59
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:51,660
Many drinking water standards and WHO
guidelines are set to be no detectible E.

60
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,670
coli or thermotolerant coliforms in a 100
mL sample.

61
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,530
You can consider that water that has
higher levels of indicator

62
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:05,110
bacteria, is probably more likely to have,
higher levels of fecal contamination.

63
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:07,690
Though there is not a very clear
correlation

64
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:11,910
between indicator bacteria and pathogens
on the other hand.

65
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:15,030
Still water having very high levels of E.

66
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:20,870
coli, more than 1000 counts per 100 mLs
It's probably very risky for consumption.

67
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,350
Water having no detectable e coli in it,

68
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:28,620
however, might not be completely safe
because E. coli

69
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:32,670
is relatively less persistent and
robust

70
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:34,880
in the environment compared to some
pathogens.

71
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,400
For this reason, it would be preferable to
combine

72
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,060
a measure of water quality, such as an E. coli

73
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:47,880
measure, with some kind of assessment
of the system's safety, like a sanitary

74
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:53,470
inspection, which identifies a number of
risk factors at a water source.

75
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,580
Then by combining a water quality measure
on

76
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,100
the vertical axis and a water
management measure

77
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,600
on the horizontal axis, we can make a

78
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:08,040
risk matrix and prioritize areas, water
sources for interventions.

79
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,160
While E. coli

80
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,200
or thermotolerant coliforms are the
most commonly used indicator

81
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,140
species, other indicators might be more
relevant for certain purposes.

82
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:24,330
Viruses travel in the environment very
differently than bacteria, so one might

83
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:30,380
want to look at coliphage viruses that
required a bacteria host to survive.

84
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,690
As an indicator for viruses.

85
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:38,320
Faecal streptococci are more hardly robust
bacteria compared to E. coli

86
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,890
so they could persist longer in the
environment and

87
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:47,210
maybe be a better indicator of long term
faecal contamination.

88
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:49,760
Traditionally methods for enumerating
Faecal

89
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:52,340
streptococci have been more complicated.

90
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:54,990
But this is changing with the development
of new methods.

91
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,530
Finally, protozoa can be very resistant to

92
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,280
disinfection, to heat, to chlorine, to
ozone.

93
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:03,620
So E. coli

94
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:07,430
is not a good indicator for a
treatment efficacy, you'll see.

95
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:10,640
But some bacteria like Clostridium
perfringens

96
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,800
or some Bacillus species can form spores

97
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,600
which are roughly similar in size

98
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:20,830
and resistance to some protozoan
pathogens.

99
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:24,290
Now let's focus in on those pathways

100
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,520
between feces and faces that involve
water.

101
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,380
We can think about a safe water chain

102
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:34,260
with different stages where contamination
could be introduced.

103
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:37,540
Contamination could occur at the water
resource itself

104
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:41,360
or during delivery to the consumer, fecal
matter can

105
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,330
also be introduced during the collection
and transport

106
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:47,260
of water if the source is outside the
home.

107
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:51,550
When water is stored inside the household
it could become contaminated.

108
00:06:51,550 --> 00:06:54,520
And finally the drinking water vessel itself,
a cup

109
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:58,780
or a glass might be dirty and introduce
fecal matter.

110
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:04,450
Now let's look at an illustration of these
different stages in a safe water chain.

111
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:07,760
First the water resource itself can be

112
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:12,260
contaminated from contact with human or
animal feces.

113
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:15,500
Surface water often contains faecal
bacteria but even

114
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:20,240
groundwater aquifers can be contaminated
by inadequately managed sanitation.

115
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,970
Even if the water resources is clean or if
water is purified at

116
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:27,120
a treatment plant, it can become

117
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,240
contaminated during delivery to the
consumer.

118
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,060
For example in a piped water supply, if
there is not continuous pressure

119
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:37,030
in the distribution system, contaminated
water may

120
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:40,520
enter the pipes through cracks or joints.

121
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,540
Another example though, could be an
improperly constructed rising main on

122
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:49,400
a borehole, or suction hand pumps, which
are primed with unsafe water.

123
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,910
The point of collection itself can be
contaminated.

124
00:07:53,910 --> 00:07:57,220
Think of a communal tap or borehole spout,
which

125
00:07:57,220 --> 00:08:01,460
is handled and contacted by adults,
children and even animals.

126
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,210
And when the point of collection is
outside the

127
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:08,010
home, people must use containers which
themselves may be dirty.

128
00:08:08,010 --> 00:08:11,970
And people often rinse containers and wipe
them with their hands before filling them

129
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,260
up, but if their hands are not clean this
may not help at all.

130
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,440
The containers must then be transported
back

131
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:24,300
to the household giving another
opportunity for contamination.

132
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:28,520
Open containers are especially vulnerable,
because it's easy to

133
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,340
contact the water with hands during
lifting and carrying.

134
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,309
And also dust or insects can enter an
uncovered container.

135
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:40,990
Once the water is take to the household,
it is

136
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:45,300
often transferred to another container,
and may be stored un-hygienically.

137
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,100
In open containers or on the floor

138
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:51,960
where children and animals can introduce
pathogens.

139
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:55,660
Point of use water treatment at this stage
offers the possibility

140
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,800
of inactivating pathogens introduced at
earlier points in the water chain.

141
00:09:03,630 --> 00:09:07,790
But, even after storage, contamination
possibilities exist.

142
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:11,230
Water may be retrieved from storage
containers using an unclean

143
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,060
dipper or ladle, especially if the storage
container is uncovered.

144
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,190
Finally, the drinking vessel itself, a
cup, or a glass,

145
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:25,410
or, perhaps, a gourd, could be full of
fecal contamination.

146
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:28,500
Again, people may wipe the drink vessel
with their hands

147
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:31,940
before using it but this might actually
the glass dirtier.

148
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:38,110
So, there are many opportunities for
contamination between the original

149
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:41,210
source of drinking water and the actual
point of consumption.

150
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:44,920
A big advantage of household water
treatment is

151
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,440
that it offers the possibility of removing
any

152
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,870
contamination that is introduced at the
water resource,

153
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,840
the delivery system or through collection
and transport.

154
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,880
Many household water treatments don't
prevent re-contamination so it

155
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,580
is important to have safe storage after a
treatment step.

156
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,660
And likewise, good hygiene, especially
washing hands with soap

157
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:08,900
is important to minimize the possibility

158
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,920
of clean drinking water becoming
contaminated

159
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:16,590
just before consumption by using a cup or
glass that is faecally contaminated.

160
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,350
So in this module, we have talked about

161
00:10:20,350 --> 00:10:23,180
different indicators of faecal
contamination and how E. coli

162
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:26,850
the preferred indicator bacteria.

163
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,570
We've shown you the F-diagram,

164
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:31,770
which illustrates different pathways
between feces

165
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:34,340
and faces, that lead to exposure

166
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:37,660
to pathogens, including through drinking
water.

167
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,850
And we've talked about different stages
along

168
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:43,860
the safe water chain from catchment to
cup.

169
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,430
Where drinking water can become
contaminated.

170
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,030
Now in the next module, we'll introduce
those

171
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:54,220
treatment technologies for household water
treatment and safe storage.
