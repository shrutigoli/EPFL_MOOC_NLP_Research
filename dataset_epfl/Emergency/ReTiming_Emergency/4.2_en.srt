00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:07,104
Hello, and welcome to this module
on sanitation products.

2
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:10,120
In this section, we're going to talk about
the different types of products.

3
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:11,780
So the different liquids and solids

4
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:14,200
that go into and out
of a sanitation system.

5
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:16,650
We have three goals in this module.

6
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:19,340
The first is to understand
why it is important to consider

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:22,360
a range of sanitation products
when you're planning a system.

8
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:26,020
Secondly, is to learn about what those
different products are.

9
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:28,770
And third, is to be able
to describe the characteristics

10
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,480
of each of those products,
so we know how to best treat

11
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:33,540
and potentially use them later on.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,180
Typically, when we think about sanitation,
we think about two things, pee and poo.

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,490
So the liquid and solid excreta that
come out of our bodies.

14
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:45,370
But in reality, there are a lot more
elements to consider.

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,630
Certainly, urine and feces are two
of the most important aspects to consider.

16
00:00:49,870 --> 00:00:53,210
But there are also many other materials
that make the sanitation system work.

17
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,230
Flush water, for example.

18
00:00:55,550 --> 00:00:59,020
You can't have a sewer system without
water to transport the urine and feces,

19
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:03,110
and in many dry cities around the world
there is simply no flush water,

20
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:06,750
and therefore, you would need to consider
a different form of transport.

21
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:08,910
There are other products
that are generated

22
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:10,630
throughout the sanitation system.

23
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,380
Sludge, for example,
is the thick, mucky layer

24
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,440
that forms at the bottom of a septic tank.

25
00:01:15,950 --> 00:01:20,740
Sludge, because of its high solids content
and viscosity, may be difficult to pump,

26
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,250
but it is also easily dried, and therefore
can be used as a soil amender.

27
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,700
We'll come back
to these examples later on.

28
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:32,620
Here is a fairly comprehensive list
of the products that should be considered

29
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,240
when planning a sanitation system.

30
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,970
There are others of course
that are not listed here,

31
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,920
but we'll focus on these ones
for the remainder of this module

32
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,240
and throughout this course.

33
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,890
Let's start with primary products.

34
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:49,750
Primary products, or the input products,
are those that enter the sanitation system

35
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:51,100
at the very beginning,

36
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,800
so they enter through the toilet.

37
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,320
Products of course, do not stay separate,

38
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,120
so they get combined and diluted.

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:00,080
They take on different names
as this happens.

40
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:03,420
First we have urine and feces.

41
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:07,450
The name for these two things
together is excreta.

42
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,150
If you just add flush water to the feces,
this is referred to as brownwater.

43
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:19,160
Brownwater only exists when urine
is separated at the source,

44
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:22,120
and we'll talk more about this later
in the module on technology.

45
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,600
When anal cleansing water,
so that's the water that's used

46
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:29,320
for washing instead of toilet paper,
or dry cleaning material,

47
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,670
are mixed in with the excreta
and flush water,

48
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:34,480
the whole mixture is referred to
as blackwater.

49
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:37,240
You may have heard of the term
"waste water" before,

50
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,360
but blackwater is a more descriptive term,

51
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,270
and because any sort of unneeded water
could be called waste water,

52
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,810
we prefer the term "black water"

53
00:02:44,810 --> 00:02:46,270
to be more specific.

54
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,130
Greywater is the other water
that's discharged from the house,

55
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:53,070
and may include
all the other types of water

56
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:59,060
that are generated in the kitchen
or from laundry, or from hand washing.

57
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,030
Here in this photo,
from Maputo, Mozambique,

58
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:07,380
we can see two men collecting water
in small storage containers.

59
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,600
If you can imagine the water it would take
to flush a toilet constantly

60
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,290
in order to transport
all of the household wastes in a toilet,

61
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,620
you can imagine how much work
would be needed

62
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,940
to collect the quantity of water required.

63
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:22,760
It's one of these examples

64
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,570
where we would have to think
of a different transport system

65
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,940
for the products that would be entering
into the sanitation system.

66
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,400
Here we can see
the different characteristics

67
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:35,110
of greywater, urine, and feces.

68
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,460
Looking first at volume, we see that
the quantity of greywater generated

69
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,080
per person is immense.

70
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:45,070
Whereas the volume of feces,
only 50 liters per person per year,

71
00:03:45,070 --> 00:03:46,510
is relatively tiny.

72
00:03:47,510 --> 00:03:50,000
We can see also that the majority
of the nutrients,

73
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:52,760
nitrogen, phosphorous, and potassium,

74
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:57,160
are in urine, with a smaller amount
in feces and very little in the greywater.

75
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:01,750
In the last row, we can see the quantities
of fecal coliforms that are present,

76
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,150
and clearly, they are concentrated
in the faeces.

77
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,460
Greywater has what may
be a surprising amount,

78
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:10,430
and these come mostly
from hand washing and showering.

79
00:04:11,050 --> 00:04:12,900
Urine, you'll notice, has none.

80
00:04:13,210 --> 00:04:16,500
The small star indicates that urine
is pathogen free in the bladder

81
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,620
of healthy people, so pathogens
in urine that is collected

82
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:22,240
outside of the body maybe
still be pathogenic.

83
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,440
In summary then, we have
large quantities of greywater,

84
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,640
with relatively no nutrient value.

85
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,960
Urine, which is generally clean,
and nutrient rich,

86
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,070
and a very small amount of feces,
that are highly pathogenic.

87
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:39,000
Knowing all of these characteristics
can help us decide on the best ways

88
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,890
to store, transport, and use
the products in our sanitation system.

89
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,840
Secondary products are those products
that are generated

90
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,580
within the sanitation system,
because of some type of transformation.

91
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,530
If you store urine for long enough,
so about a month or so,

92
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,700
the pH and ammonia concentration
will increase to the point

93
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,860
that it becomes self-sterilising.

94
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,700
So that means that most of the pathogens
in the urine will be destroyed,

95
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:06,480
and that urine can safely
be used as a nutrient source.

96
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:11,020
All that's needed for this type
of transformation is time.

97
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,150
Similarly, faeces can be dried,
simply in the presence of time and heat,

98
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:21,160
and once fully desiccated,
the feces will be,

99
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:24,700
depending on the temperature
and storage time, quite hygienic.

100
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:29,190
These processes, however,
are only applicable to the products

101
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,580
if they are separate.

102
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:34,470
If excreta is left in a pit,
remember the mixture

103
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:39,700
of urine and feces, and is allowed
to degrade naturally and slowly over time,

104
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:42,430
the resulting product would be
an organic material

105
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:45,010
not unlike compost or humus.

106
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:48,660
Blackwater, on the other hand,
is a mixture of all the things

107
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:52,630
we discussed before,
feces, flush water, toilet paper,

108
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,000
and after time, or with some
kind of physical process,

109
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,330
the solids with separate,
so that you'll be left

110
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:02,090
with two new products:
a semi-clarified effluent,

111
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,210
and a dense sludge of the solids.

112
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,480
Here we can see a bit
of what the sludge looks like.

113
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,550
It's a thin sludge,
but it's still a typical sludge.

114
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:16,080
These are trucks that have collected
the sludge from septic tanks

115
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,550
or pit latrines, and are discharging it
onto an empty field, which unfortunately,

116
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,840
is not uncommon.

117
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,770
Fecal sludge must be removed constantly
from many household level technologies,

118
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,460
and yet there are few treatment processes
available that are able to treat it.

119
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,040
Here is a great example
of a sludge drying bed.

120
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,390
The sludge trucks from the previous slide
would come here, dump their sludge

121
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,400
onto one of these dedicated drying beds.

122
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,030
The beds are made from layers
of gravel and sand.

123
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:50,130
The sludge layer is applied on top,
and the solids stay on the sand layer

124
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:53,240
and dry out under the sun,
while the effluent percolates

125
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:56,480
through the sand and down
through the gravel, where it's collected.

126
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:59,550
The effluent, don't forget,
is another new product

127
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,800
that must be treated in a separate process
before it can be discharged

128
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,170
into the environment.

129
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,770
In the same way that sludge
settles to the bottom of blackwater,

130
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:11,430
lighter particles will rise to the top.

131
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,770
FOGS: fats, oils, grease, and surfactants,

132
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,510
FOGS is the name given to all the frothy scum
that floats to the top of a wastewater,

133
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,290
particularly greywater.

134
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:28,680
FOGS generally comes from the cooking fat
and soaps that are used in the kitchen.

135
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:32,200
FOGS can clog pipes and pumps
if it's not removed early

136
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,730
in the sanitation chain.

137
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,440
Here, you can see a nice example
of a simple interceptor tank

138
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:43,040
that prevents the FOGS
from entering into the small pipes.

139
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:47,180
After some time, that little strainer
on the left will be used to remove

140
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:50,740
the FOGS and keep the small
interceptor functioning well.

141
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,990
Most of the products that we've discussed
so far are materials that are pathogenic

142
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,920
or harmful to the environment
in some way,

143
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,900
but the products
we're going to talk about here

144
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,870
are ones that can be produced
by a sanitation system,

145
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,580
and are actually beneficial.

146
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,940
Compost, or humus,
can be created with the dry fecal sludge

147
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,790
we saw in the earlier slide,
simply by processing it

148
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:15,660
with some sort of organic material,
like market waste.

149
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:19,860
Biogas, which is the result
of anaerobic digestion,

150
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:24,050
and consists mostly of methane,
can be collected and used as a fuel

151
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:25,480
for cooking and lighting.

152
00:08:26,070 --> 00:08:29,170
These types of beneficial products
are not difficult to produce,

153
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:33,000
but they must be considered in the early
stages of sanitation planning

154
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,530
so that the most value from the system
can be obtained without waste.

155
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:44,580
Here we see a diagram and an example
of a fixed dome biogas reactor.

156
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,830
So just wrapping up
what we've discussed so far:

157
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:52,630
There are a lot of products besides
pee and poo that need to be considered.

158
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,130
Each product will contain a different
quantity and variety

159
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,060
of nutrients and pathogens, which will
influence the treatment requirements

160
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,020
and also the potential use options.

161
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:06,280
The volume of each product
will great influence how it's transported

162
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,930
and treated within the sanitation system.

163
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,060
The range and type of products
in a sanitation system

164
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,320
will determine the number, type,
and sequence of technologies

165
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,680
that will be needed in the final design.

166
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:21,450
Choosing these technologies
