1
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,850
In this lecture, we are going to look at
technologies for on-site blackwater and

2
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,250
greywater management, including the
septic tank and the biogas reactor.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:17,270
These technologies are based on
anaerobic processes, and I will just

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,940
explain what that means.

5
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:24,300
The word 'anaerobic' describes
biological processes that occur in the

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,050
absence of oxygen.

7
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:30,140
These processes naturally take place in
swamps, marshes, ponds and other

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:34,150
standing water bodies.
They can easily be recognized

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,160
by the formation of gas bubbles,
as shown in these beautiful photographs.

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:42,160
The gas is formed, for example, at the
bottom of a pond, where the anaerobic

11
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,460
bacteria decompose carbon-rich organic
substances into methane and carbon dioxide

12
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,470
(also called 'biogas').

13
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:56,780
The gas bubbles then rise to the surface.
In cold areas, where the lake surfaces

14
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:59,800
freeze in wintertime, it can
sometimes be observed that

15
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:04,140
the bubbles get trapped below the ice
surface, as shown on the two pictures

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:05,110
on the right side.

17
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,990
In wastewater engineering, we
often talk about 'anaerobic digestion.'

18
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:17,240
The term 'anaerobic digestion' refers
to the degradation and stabilization of

19
00:01:17,290 --> 00:01:21,460
organic matter by microorganisms without
oxygen, leading to production of biogas.

20
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,290
Both anaerobic and aerobic processes
are used for wastewater treatment.

21
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,350
The aerobic ones need aeration systems to
provide enough oxygen and are technically

22
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,440
a bit more complex.

23
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:36,700
They are, therefore, not so commonly
used at the collection and storage level.

24
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:41,160
We will introduce those technologies later
in the collectors about centralized and

25
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:43,240
semi-centralized treatment.

26
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:47,400
So much for an introduction to the
general processes. Now we want to look

27
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,130
at a few technologies.

28
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:53,460
The septic tank is among the most
widespread onsite sanitation technologies.

29
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,630
There are two important things you
have to know about the septic tank.

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,400
First - it is a water-tight tank,
typically made of reinforced concrete,

31
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,270
polyethylene or fiberglass and,
second - it has an outlet, through which

32
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:12,940
the clarified effluent leaves the tank.
In practice, people are not always aware

33
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:14,470
of those two aspects.

34
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:18,940
They may even call an open-bottom pit
a septic tank, which is actually wrong.

35
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:23,550
Blackwater and greywater
enter the tank through an inlet T.

36
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,670
Settleable solids fall down to the
bottom, where they accumulate as sludge.

37
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:35,190
With time, the sludge undergoes
some stabilization by anaerobic digestion.

38
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:39,360
It has to be removed every 3-5 years.

39
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:43,690
Floatable substances move up to
the surface, forming a scum layer.

40
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:48,240
The effluent from the clearwater zone, in
the middle, flows out through an outlet T

41
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,500
and is then typically infiltrated,
for example, in a leach field.

42
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,980
One or two separation walls in the
tank can improve the solid / liquid

43
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,860
separation process.

44
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,370
The good thing about septic tanks is
that they are passive and do not require

45
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:10,020
electrical energy to function.
This makes this technology quite robust.

46
00:03:10,970 --> 00:03:14,970
Construction is relatively costly but
the technology has a long service life

47
00:03:15,210 --> 00:03:17,270
and requires little maintenance.

48
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,310
The costs for mechanical
emptying, however, may be considerable.

49
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,930
Little space is required because this
technology is typically built underground.

50
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:30,660
On the negative side - it has to
be mentioned that the removal of

51
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:35,580
pathogenic organisms, suspended matter,
organic substances and nutrients is

52
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:39,600
relatively low, therefore, the
effluent, as well as the sludge,

53
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:43,440
require further treatment
and / or appropriate discharge.

54
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:48,650
To ensure optimum performance of the
septic tank, it has to be regularly pumped

55
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:50,440
as shown in the photo.

56
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:57,200
An anaerobic baffled reactor, or ABR, is
like an improved version of a large

57
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,030
septic tank. Its functioning is very
similar, but it is equipped with baffles,

58
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:07,330
which form several anaerobic chambers
to remove and digest organics and improve

59
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:14,140
the treatment performance. The treatment
can be further improved by providing 1-3

60
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,140
fixed-bed filter units, which helps to
trap non-settleable suspended particles

61
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:22,110
and provide an increased
surface for microbial growth.

62
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:25,020
This technology is called
"anaerobic filter."

63
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:31,020
An ABR, or an anaerobic filter, can be
installed at the small scale for on-site

64
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:35,010
collection and treatment, but also
at semi-centralized or centralized

65
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,150
treatment level.

66
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:39,430
More detailed explanations
of these two technologies

67
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:41,570
will be provided in module 3.2.

68
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:45,660
In the septic tank, ABR
(or anaerobic filter),

69
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:49,930
the gases produced in the anaerobic
processes are just released into the

70
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,120
atmosphere because their quantities
are relatively low. The biogas reactor,

71
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,190
or anaerobic digestor, however, is
designed to generate as much biogas

72
00:05:00,190 --> 00:05:04,180
as possible and to capture and collect
it, so that it can be used as a renewable

73
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,200
energy source for
cooking or other purposes.

74
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,210
The blackwater from a toilet can be
directly connected to the digestor.

75
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:17,510
In order to produce significant amounts of
biogas, additional inputs like cow dung or

76
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,880
organic solid waste, are
normally mixed in at the inlet.

77
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:26,100
The substrate flows into the reactor,
where it has a retention time of,

78
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,700
typically, 15-to-25 days.

79
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:34,060
The biogas collects in the dome at
the top of the reactor, and is transported

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,170
to the point of use, through a gas pipe.
When new substrate is added to the reactor

81
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,360
or when the gas pressure rises, the
digestate flows into the expansion chamber

82
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:49,390
from where it can be removed.
In the photos, you can see some examples

83
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:55,020
of different biogas reactor designs.
Picture on the upper left shows a thick

84
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:00,260
stone reactor under construction. This is
another thick stone digestor, similar to

85
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:05,720
the one previously shown on the drawing.
As you can see, the space requirement is

86
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,650
quite low, because it
can be built underground.

87
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:14,560
On the right side, you can see a
floating dome reactor, where the

88
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,900
gas storage can move up and down,
depending on the gas volume inside;

89
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:25,130
and this one here is a biogas stove.
This technology has the clear benefit that

90
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:29,190
no energy is required for operation,
but energy is actually produced.

91
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,560
A high reduction of organic
matter and particles can be achieved.

92
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,560
The digestate is almost odorless and
still contains all the nutrients, so it

93
00:06:39,570 --> 00:06:44,860
can be used as an excellent fertilizer,
however, the agricultural application

94
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,620
has to be done correctly and carefully
because the digestate may still contain

95
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:53,660
some pathogens.
This technology has many benefits

96
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:57,860
but its success depends on correct
implementation by experts, proper

97
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:01,100
operation and regular maintenance.

98
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:05,140
We have seen that there are several
anaerobic technologies that are robust

99
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,890
and easy to operate for on-site
treatment of blackwater and greywater.

100
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:12,620
I want you to remember
two things from this module:

101
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,370
First - septic tanks can be a good
solution but it is important that the

102
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:21,680
effluent is properly disposed of and
that the sludge is regularly removed.

103
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:26,410
The second thing that I want you to
remember is that the biogas reactor

104
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:31,520
can be an attractive technology, but the
economic benefits do not mean that it is

105
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,740
always automatically successful.
Whether or not the initial investment

106
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,800
costs can be recovered will depend on
the correct design and implementation

107
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:42,580
and their motivated operator.
