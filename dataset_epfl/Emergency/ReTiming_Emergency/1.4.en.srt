1
00:00:04,294 --> 00:00:06,810
There are hundreds, maybe thousands of

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:10,067
organisms which can cause water-borne
diseases.

3
00:00:10,067 --> 00:00:15,750
One useful way to classify these
pathogens, is by biological type.

4
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:20,030
In this module, we'll briefly talk about
four different classes of pathogens.

5
00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:24,950
The most important ones are the protozoa,
bacteria and viruses.

6
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,620
But we'll also give an example of one
helminth

7
00:00:27,620 --> 00:00:31,150
or parasitic worm which is transmitted
through drinking water.

8
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:36,340
The first thing to note about pathogens is
that they there are small.

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:42,240
A human hair is about 0.1 millimeters, or
100 microns in diameter.

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:45,430
Protozoa, the largest class of pathogens
are much

11
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:48,784
smaller, usually about 10 to 50 microns in
size.

12
00:00:48,784 --> 00:00:54,020
Protozoa are one-celled eukaryotes, that
means that their cell

13
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,780
has a nucleus unlike prokaryotic cells
such as bacteria.

14
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:04,069
Some protozoa can form an egg like cyst to
survive harsh conditions.

15
00:01:04,069 --> 00:01:07,940
Such as exposure to extreme temperature,
chemicals,

16
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,380
or long periods without water or food.

17
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,890
Many protozoa are parasites, and cause
diseases, like malaria and giardia.

18
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:22,340
Here, you see Entomoeba histolytica and
Cryptosporidium

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,977
parvum, both of which can cause severe
diarrhea.

20
00:01:25,977 --> 00:01:30,232
Entamoeba is the cause of amoebic
dysentery, or bloody diarrhea.

21
00:01:30,232 --> 00:01:34,228
This disease affects adults more than
children, and only about

22
00:01:34,228 --> 00:01:38,451
10 to 20% of those infected with entamoeba
develop symptoms.

23
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:43,062
It is estimated to cause more than 100,000
deaths per year.

24
00:01:43,062 --> 00:01:44,778
Recent studies have shown that

25
00:01:44,778 --> 00:01:47,484
cryptosporidium, commonly called crypto,
is

26
00:01:47,484 --> 00:01:51,100
one of the leading causes of diarrheal
disease among children.

27
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,680
A large and important research project,
the

28
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:58,710
Global Enteric Multicenter Study or GEMS,
has

29
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,000
found it to be the second most

30
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,528
commonly isolated pathogen among children
with diarrhea.

31
00:02:03,528 --> 00:02:04,594
After rotavirus.

32
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:11,106
Cryptosporidium forms cysts, which are
about five microns

33
00:02:11,106 --> 00:02:14,710
in diameter, and are highly resistant to
treatment.

34
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,016
The first human cases of crypto were
reported

35
00:02:18,016 --> 00:02:22,940
in 1976, and the disease became infamous
in 1993.

36
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:26,060
When an outbreak occurred in the northern
US city of Milwaukee.

37
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:31,470
Cryptosparidian overwhelmed the treatment
plants, filtration system,

38
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:33,340
and chlorine has no effect on crypto.

39
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:38,840
Over two weeks 400,000 people became ill
and over 100

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:42,880
deaths were caused, mainly in people with
compromised immune systems.

41
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:47,490
Cryptosporidium is a major cause of death
among people with HIV/AIDS.

42
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,830
The infectious dose for cryptosporidium
and other protozoa is low.

43
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:56,120
Even a single cyst can cause disease.

44
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,960
Bacteria are organisms a few microns in
size and

45
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,160
of varying shapes such as spheres, rods,
or spirals.

46
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,490
They are prokaryotes which means that
unlike

47
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,150
the protozoa, they do not contain a
nucleus.

48
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,440
Bacteria are everywhere, growing in soil,
in the

49
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,750
deep ocean, and even in acidic hot
springs.

50
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,840
A gram of soil or a milliliter

51
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,999
of water can contain several million
bacterial cells.

52
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,340
Although the vast majority bacteria are
harmless or even beneficial to

53
00:03:30,340 --> 00:03:35,870
humans a few can cause diseases such as
cholera, trachoma or salmonella.

54
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,070
Here you see the E.coli and vibrio
cholera bacteria.

55
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:45,709
They like most bacteria are about one or
two microns in size.

56
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,920
E.coli is universally found in human

57
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,880
and animal feces, but is normally not
pathogenic.

58
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,080
In fact E.coli is the preferred

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,820
indicator bacteria used to demonstrate
fecal contamination.

60
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,410
However, some strains of E.coli do cause
disease.

61
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:06,990
These are called pathogenic E.coli.

62
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:12,120
And one group of these pathogens, is the
enterotoxogenic E.coli, or ETEC.

63
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:16,579
The GEMS project found ETEC to be among
the top 5

64
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:18,990
pathogens, isolated from children with

65
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:22,410
diarrhea, and affects particularly, small
infants.

66
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:26,510
The other bacterial pathogen most commonly
found by

67
00:04:26,510 --> 00:04:30,070
GEMS was shigella, a distant relative of E
coli.

68
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,500
Together, shigella and E.coli are thought
to cause

69
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,130
up to 1/3 of the diarrheal disease
mortality globally.

70
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:44,260
Vibrio cholera causes the terrifying
disease cholera.

71
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:47,500
It can spread very rapidly under the right
conditions, and

72
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,410
can cause severe diarrhea and death within
hours if not treated.

73
00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:54,980
Cholera thrives in conditions where
there's

74
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:58,510
crowding and poor sanitation and hygiene.

75
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,970
Outbreaks can occur after natural
disasters, in

76
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:04,980
refugee camps and in peri-urban slums.

77
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:10,405
There are an estimated 3 to 5 million
cholera cases, and

78
00:05:10,405 --> 00:05:14,970
a 100 thousand to 120 thousand deaths due
to cholera every year.

79
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:20,625
The smallest of the pathogens are the
viruses, which

80
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:25,190
are typically 0.1 microns, that's the same
as 100 nanometers,

81
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:26,930
or even smaller in diameter.

82
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:32,620
Viruses don't have an independent
metabolism that can only

83
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:36,020
grow on or reproduce within a living host
cell

84
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:38,060
and can not multiply with in the
environment.

85
00:05:39,430 --> 00:05:42,090
Many viruses are hosts specific, causing

86
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,810
disease in humans or specific animals
only.

87
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:49,403
Rotaviruses, and Hepatitis A and E
viruses, are

88
00:05:49,403 --> 00:05:53,166
the most widespread, water born viruses
effecting humans.

89
00:05:54,895 --> 00:05:58,937
Here you see Rotavirus, at about 75
nanometers, and

90
00:05:58,937 --> 00:06:03,590
Hepatitis E, which is quite small, at
about 30 nanometers.

91
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,935
You could line up thousands of hepatitis E

92
00:06:05,935 --> 00:06:08,660
viruses and still be smaller than a human
hair.

93
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:16,140
Rotavirus is one of the main pathogens
causing diarrheal disease.

94
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,910
The GEMS project found rotavirus to be the
single

95
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,860
most commonly isolated pathogen among
children with diarrheal disease.

96
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,680
It is particularly prevalent among the
youngest children.

97
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:32,130
Infected people shed large numbers of the
virus in their feces.

98
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:35,757
Approximately ten to the 11 viruses
per gram

99
00:06:35,757 --> 00:06:40,380
of fecal matter, that's a 100,000 of
millions.

100
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,450
The viruses are highly infective.

101
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:46,700
Only ten to 100 virus particles are needed
to cause infection.

102
00:06:48,305 --> 00:06:54,200
Rotavirus is estimated to cause
over 500,000 deaths each year in 2004.

103
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:56,940
With more than 85% of these deaths

104
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:00,240
occurring in low-income countries in
Africa and Asia.

105
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,080
Hepatitis A is spread through food, water,
or direct contact

106
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:11,210
with infected people. Hepatitis E is mainly
spread through drinking water.

107
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:16,550
Both diseases are widespread in the
developing world, in countries with poor

108
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:19,670
sanitation and hygiene, nearly all
children

109
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,250
are infected before the age of 10.

110
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,050
Every year, there are over 3 million acute
cases of

111
00:07:26,050 --> 00:07:30,490
hepatitis E and over 50,000 deaths related
to hepatitis E.

112
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:35,530
Finally, although it is nearly eradicated,

113
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:38,160
polio remains an important water-born
virus.

114
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:43,280
There were only 223 cases reported in

115
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:47,930
2012, down from some 350,000 cases in
1988.

116
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:55,370
Only three countries remain polio endemic,
Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan.

117
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:57,180
But as long as a single child remains

118
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:00,400
infected, children in all countries are at
risk.

119
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:05,950
Water, sanitation, and hygiene play an
important role in eliminating polio.

120
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,960
From the smallest of pathogens to the
largest.

121
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,680
The helminths, or parasitic worms, which

122
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,250
can invade human intestines or other
tissues.

123
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:21,220
Most helminth transmission is due to poor
sanitation and hygiene.

124
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:25,380
But one particularly nasty helminth is
mainly transmitted through drinking water.

125
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,730
This is dracunculus medinensis, or guinea
worm.

126
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,220
It's larvae live in fresh water and

127
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:36,039
are eaten by small aquatic insects called
copepods.

128
00:08:37,049 --> 00:08:39,919
The larvae are tiny, but the copepods are
big,

129
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,250
typically about one millimeter and visible
to the naked eye.

130
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:50,930
Once a person drinks water containing the
copepods, hydrochloric acid in the stomach

131
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:56,040
kills the insect and releases the larvae,
which mature and grow into adult worms.

132
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,770
These can reach a length of nearly a

133
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:01,320
meter, and be as wide as a spaghetti
noodle.

134
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:04,930
The worms migrate through the body and

135
00:09:04,930 --> 00:09:08,450
emerge through the skin, often near the
feet.

136
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,600
The worm has to be removed slowly, winding
it up and

137
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:14,650
pulling it out of the body bit by bit over
weeks.

138
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,100
This is extremely painful.

139
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,380
It creates sores and blisters.

140
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:24,130
And people often soak
their feet in water to relieve the pain.

141
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:27,800
The worm then discharges hundreds of
thousands of

142
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,970
larvae into the water, completing the
transmission cycle.

143
00:09:34,850 --> 00:09:38,520
Major progress has been made towards
eliminating guinea worm.

144
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,850
Since 1986 a global eradication campaign
has been led by the

145
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:48,190
Carter Center in close collaboration with
WHO, the CDC, and UNICEF.

146
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:52,445
The number of reported cases has dropped
from

147
00:09:52,445 --> 00:09:57,833
3.5 million in 1986 to just 542 in 2012.

148
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:05,500
As of 2012, it is found only in a few
hundred villages in remote rural areas,

149
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:10,980
mostly in South Sudan with a handful of
cases in Ethiopia, Mali, and Chad.

150
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:15,860
Once guinea worm is eradicated, it will be

151
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,260
only the second human disease ever
eradicated after smallpox.

152
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:24,650
Unless, of course, polio is eradicated
first, which seems unlikely.

153
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:31,200
And unlike smallpox, guinea worm will be
beaten without vaccines or

154
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:34,580
drugs, through community-scale
interventions which involve

155
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:37,930
protection and treatment of drinking
water.

156
00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,860
Because the copapod hosts are large, they
can be

157
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:45,200
readily removed, from water, using simple
cloth, or sand filters.

158
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:51,770
So in summary, we've covered four main
types of pathogens today.

159
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,060
We've talked a little bit about helminths,

160
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:55,500
with the example of Dracunuculosis, or
Guinea

161
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,700
worm disease, which is transmitted through
these

162
00:10:58,700 --> 00:11:03,280
very large copepods around a millimeter in
diameter.

163
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:08,820
The next biggest are the protozoa, such as
entomoeba, cryptosporidium, and giardia,

164
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:13,940
which are 10 to 50 microns in diameter,
and can form very resistant cysts.

165
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,090
Then we've got the bacteria, such as E
coli, Shigella, Vibrio

166
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:23,330
cholera, which are 1 or 2 or 3 microns in
size

167
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:30,860
and can cause serious diarrhea. And then
finally the smallest class is the viruses.

168
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:36,110
Rotavirus, hepatitis, polio virus, which
are even smaller than a micron.

169
00:11:36,110 --> 00:11:38,950
As small as 30 nanometers in size.
