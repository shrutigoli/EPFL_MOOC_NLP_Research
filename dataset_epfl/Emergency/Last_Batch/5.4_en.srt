1
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:10,260
In the previous video, we have seen how to
classify, quantify and map the different waste

2
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:12,770
produced in a health care facility.

3
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:18,160
In this video, you will learn about the different
stages of medical waste management.

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,080
Since there is no universal answer, we will
also discuss how to choose between various

5
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,869
management systems and identify good and bad
practices.

6
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:32,570
Medical Waste Management can be divided in
five main stages:

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:37,350
The first stage is the Segregation:
The sorting of the waste in the established

8
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,739
categories must always be the responsibility
of the person who produce it.

9
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:45,089
Usually a clinical staff member.

10
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:49,699
Ideally as soon as the waste is produced,
it has to be disposed.

11
00:00:49,699 --> 00:00:54,239
It must be done as close as possible to the
site where the waste is produced.

12
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:59,390
Of course, it worthy to mention that if the
waste is separated it means that the treatment

13
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,390
will be different.

14
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:06,170
There is no point in sorting wastes that eventually
undergoes the same treatment process.

15
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,930
The second stage is the Temporary Storage:
Waste must be collected regularly.

16
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:15,940
It must never be allowed to accumulate where
it is produced.

17
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,119
The volume , the capacity of the containers,
and the frequency of collection are the main

18
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:22,110
parameters to account.

19
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:25,579
The third stage is the Transport
…to the waste area: The waste are separated

20
00:01:25,579 --> 00:01:28,659
in categories is transported to the waste
area.

21
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:35,450
In a way that reduces the possibility of accidents
such as spillages for example

22
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:40,979
The fourth stage is the Treatment:
According to the system in place, the waste

23
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:43,552
need to be reduced in volume or made not hazardous
anymore.

24
00:01:43,552 --> 00:01:49,560
To reduce the public health risk such treatment
should be the responsibility of hospital and

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,560
done on site.

26
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,299
If no appropriate treatment infrastructure
exists in the vicinity.

27
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:54,329
Finally, the disposal.

28
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:55,900
The final and definitive step.

29
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:02,859
Usually it consists in buring it in a sanitary
landfill or in waste pit.

30
00:02:02,859 --> 00:02:09,920
Here, an example of a plan with a specific
solution for each category and each stage.

31
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:16,599
Note that general waste is not included because
if not mixed with infectious one it does not

32
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,480
pose any risk.

33
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:24,870
The one presented here are solutions typically
encountered in a low income settings.

34
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,290
How do you come up with the most appropriate
plan?

35
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:29,330
Well, that’s indeed the tricky part.

36
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:30,569
Every context requires adaptation.

37
00:02:30,569 --> 00:02:34,120
National legislation, when existing, must
lead the way.

38
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,340
When a legislation is not available, resources
exist to support the decision making process

39
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:51,909
Here, a decisional tree proposed by the ICRC
Here others examples of decisional trees by

40
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:55,900
the WHO,
This scenario illustrates an urban area with

41
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:03,140
access to modern treatment facilities
This one an urban area WITHOUT access to treatment

42
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:08,900
facilities
This applies to a peri-urban location

43
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:12,880
and finally a rural one.

44
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:16,540
You can later go through each on them in details.

45
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:19,860
What is common to all these decisional trees
is:

46
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:27,680
The existence or not of national regulations,
The availability of treatment facilities in

47
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,010
the area,
The space readiness,

48
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:35,959
The proximity of neighbor communities
And the existing financial and human resources.

49
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:39,640
The specific steps in the process may vary.

50
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:46,530
The objective is always the same: safely reduce
the risk of infection spreading.

51
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:53,320
So finally, how does a system of medical waste
management look like?

52
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:58,459
How do you do if you have to get rid of sharp
objects such as needles, scalpel or broken

53
00:03:58,459 --> 00:03:59,459
glass?

54
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:06,819
Here one system for Sharps in low income settings.

55
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:08,439
We need to start with the segregation.

56
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,959
The simplest option might be to use only a
Safety box.

57
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:20,000
A paper carton box, widely available everywhere
in the world, specifically designed and labelled

58
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,100
to transport sharp waste.

59
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:25,670
Safety Boxes need to be transported into the
waste area.

60
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:31,090
They can be incinerated and finally the ashes
and the remaining needles disposed into a

61
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,140
sharp pit.

62
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,730
The operations behind each step need to be
correctly performed.

63
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:41,980
Hospital staff need to be properly equipped
and trained.

64
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:48,350
For example segregation requires to strictly
separate the different categories.

65
00:04:48,350 --> 00:04:55,130
If this is not done, the consequence is simple:
all the steps down the line cannot work anymore.

66
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,870
You can see two examples.

67
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:58,730
One of a bad triage.

68
00:04:58,730 --> 00:05:04,860
And another of a well-organized nurse trolley
with the proper medical waste containers ready

69
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,170
for segregation immediately after the generation
of the waste.

70
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:13,610
Same applies for all the other steps.

71
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:18,700
Here you see, a bad example of storage, while
there, a good one.

72
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:24,080
Let me stress what is the point here: the
first picture is an example of bad practice,

73
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:29,720
not because it shows an environment dirty
and not well kept, but because it does not

74
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:34,770
accomplish to principle of reducing the risk
for the users of the health facility.

75
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:42,170
Those boxes left unattended, are a temptation
for the kids, they can easy spill over and

76
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:49,660
therefore requiring remediation procedures,
which are adding extra risks.

77
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:54,070
Again,
guess in which picture it is easier to have

78
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,180
an accidental spill over of the sharp box?

79
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,340
Sometimes, very simple and low cost solutions
like a trolley, with a flat bed and security

80
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:07,550
railings can have huge impacts in reduction
of accidents.

81
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:10,020
No need to be always fancy!

82
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:17,200
Same question: which practice, in the pictures,
do you think entails less risk?

83
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,850
We have finally arrived in the waste area.

84
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,960
A space that needs to be controlled and properly
equipped.

85
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,940
Clearly there are some practices that are
not recommended and they can be extremely

86
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,970
dangerous for the operators and the surrounding
community.

87
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:37,030
The slow burning here is extremely unsafe.

88
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:41,440
A dangerous exposure to dioxins.

89
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:48,210
Maybe at this point, it is important to distinguish
between burning and incineration.

90
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:54,110
Burning is a thermal oxidation of waste able
to produce a reduction of the volume but not

91
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:57,030
is decontamination.

92
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:02,610
Only when incineration conditions are reached,
we can talk about destruction of the pathogen

93
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:04,020
load in the waste.

94
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:11,320
Oxygen, air flow, temperature and retention
time they should be in the right mix to allow

95
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,880
incineration to happen.

96
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:20,400
I’d like to stress a point that often come
up.

97
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,590
Medical Waste Management is often assimilated
with Incineration only.

98
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:30,770
Sometimes building or providing a new incinerator
is seen as a kind of miracle solution that

99
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:33,670
makes the all waste problem disappears.

100
00:07:33,670 --> 00:07:39,100
Unfortunately, an incinerator is only a step
of a whole.

101
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:44,020
Actually, incineration should be limited as
much as possible, because it always comes

102
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:46,310
with important negative effects.

103
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:54,810
A comprehensive study on small scale incinerators
commissioned by WHO in 2004 proved the following

104
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:58,840
conclusions:
Single chamber incinerators (what I often

105
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:03,540
call pizza hoven) should be banned because
their emission level is not acceptable.

106
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:09,120
They don’t reach incineration conditions.

107
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:15,470
Double-chamber self combustion incinerators,
like this one, should be used only as a transitional

108
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,470
solution.

109
00:08:16,470 --> 00:08:22,500
If chosen, the way they are operated is paramount
it can tilt the balance between the overall

110
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,370
cost benefit analysis.

111
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:29,750
The same machine is giving very different
results.

112
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:36,260
More advanced technologies such as assisted
combustion double chambers incinerators or

113
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:42,539
completely different technology, like small
autoclaving should be promoted as soon as

114
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:49,050
the proper conditions of financial and technical
sustainability exist.

115
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:56,750
Problem is that in many cases, these conditions
are very very difficult to meet.

116
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:03,220
They should be evaluated on a case by case
basis.

117
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:11,060
Here a table summarizing the suitability treatment
techniques by type of waste

118
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,500
So , now it is clear.

119
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,779
There is no standard solution.

120
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:20,570
Here another example of how to treat the same
waste, SHARP.

121
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:26,040
In this case, segregation is pushed further
within the same sharp category.

122
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:30,329
We now differentiate between needles, glass
and scalpel.

123
00:09:30,329 --> 00:09:35,839
Each of them has its on dedicated container
that it is directly disposed with a dedicated

124
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:42,879
device on top the pit
Where the sharp will be permanently disposed.

125
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:48,589
This provides multiple benefits:
it reduce the manipulation of sharps in the

126
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:53,500
waste area,
it reduces the accidents due to glass explosions,

127
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:57,180
it reduces the amount of waste to be incinerated.

128
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:03,519
All very good points, but they need to be
counterbalanced by more attention required

129
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,310
by the staff, more follow-up.

130
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:12,220
Always a weak point in all systems.

131
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,120
Once again the most adapted solution depends
on the context.

132
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,370
Protecting public health through the management
of wastes can be achieved by a variety of

133
00:10:23,370 --> 00:10:24,370
methods.

134
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:29,439
A context specific analysis should guide the
selection of an appropriate system.

135
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:40,180
A way to assess a change in the system is
provided by this reverted pyramid : the ‘waste

136
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:46,730
hierarchy’: illustrating the most desirable
method at the top to the least desirable at

137
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:47,810
the base.

138
00:10:47,810 --> 00:10:52,910
Let’s see some examples of applications
of these principles.

139
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:56,760
Prevent:
For Example: many medical Equipments, such

140
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:05,120
as intravenous bags, artery catheters, blood
bags, dialysis bags and tubing contain Polyvinyl

141
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,750
Chloride (PVC) plastic.

142
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:13,490
Incinerated, they produce CHLORINATED DIOXINS
which are extremely potent, toxic substances.

143
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,339
Alternative products, PVC free, exist in the
market.

144
00:11:18,339 --> 00:11:21,649
Their choice would prevent a mayor problem.

145
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:26,459
-Another example:
The use of digital X-ray imagery would totally

146
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:36,010
prevent the problem of the disposal of toxic
development liquid.

147
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:39,899
Reduce:
-The strict respect of segregation procedures

148
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:47,300
can dramatically reduce the quantity of waste
to be handled as medical waste.

149
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:55,480
No need to treat kitchen waste as infectious!

150
00:11:55,480 --> 00:12:04,470
and finally Reuse.
this is a Reusable Sharp Container developed

151
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:05,470
by MSF.

152
00:12:05,470 --> 00:12:14,149
It is safe in protecting medical operators
from accidental puncture, and it can even

153
00:12:14,149 --> 00:12:20,600
be built with local materials, but more importantly,
it prevents to use of whatsoever treatment

154
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:26,490
(usually incineration) to safely dispose of
the needles it contains.

155
00:12:26,490 --> 00:12:42,490
Its contents is dropped in a dedicated pit,
and kept out reach in a permanent way.

156
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:48,889
Use these principles as guidelines when designing
a Medical Waste Management system.

157
00:12:48,889 --> 00:12:55,990
Keep in mind that, more often than not, you
will need to compromise in order to enforce

158
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:04,970
sustainability or to reduce costs, but always
choose the option reducing the overall risk.

159
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:11,319
In conclusion to recapitulate this video,
we briefly saw the actual steps of a waste

160
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:15,930
systems,
We saw how the overall system should be designed

161
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:21,660
according to the local resources available
And more importantly how each step should

162
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:26,880
be properly executed in order to obtain the
desired effect.

163
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,259
Finally we review the overall set of principles
that should be always at the basis of a sound

164
00:13:32,259 --> 00:13:37,660
medical waste management system
