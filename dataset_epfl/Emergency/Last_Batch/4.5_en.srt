00:00:04,610 --> 00:00:10,500
Hi there and welcome back to the module on
on-site technologies for collection, storage

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,390
and partial treatment for the emergency context.

3
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:19,220
After learning the theory behind sanitation
in humanitarian responses, it is now time

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,370
to have a look at some of the technologies.

5
00:00:24,370 --> 00:00:29,010
In this module you will learn about different
on-site technologies that are suited for an

6
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:31,630
acute humanitarian crisis.

7
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:36,460
Remember that there are many criteria that
will determine whether a technology is suitable

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,580
for a context.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:43,570
We will have a look at one technology that
can be categorized as a user interface, the

10
00:00:43,570 --> 00:00:48,410
shallow trench latrine a simple upgrade to
controlled open defecation.

11
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:53,790
Then you will be introduced to 5 on-site technologies
from the collection and storage slash treatment

12
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,350
functional group.

13
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:00,600
Please note that this list is in no way complete
and you should consult other literature in

14
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:05,019
order to find the best technology for your
context.

15
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:09,720
During an acute humanitarian crisis, it might
be that sanitation infrastructure is completely

16
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,080
destroyed or unusable in the short- to medium
term.

17
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,740
People will still need to defecate and until
another sanitation system exists, they are

18
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,840
often forced to defecate in the open.

19
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,920
This is a major health threat as it can spread
diseases such as diarrhoea, cholera or typhus.

20
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,220
Therefore, usually the first measure until
materials for improved latrine construction

21
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:37,930
are available is to control open defecation.

22
00:01:37,930 --> 00:01:43,000
This means that designated areas should be
allocated where open defecation is allowed,

23
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,549
for example a field away from health centres,
schools or food places such as kitchens and

24
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:50,560
markets.

25
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,270
There are several easy measures to improve
a controlled open defecation field.

26
00:01:55,270 --> 00:02:00,060
Digging shallow trenches will make decommissioning
of such a field easier, providing minimal

27
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:05,799
privacy with simple screens can make it more
dignified to use and hand-washing facilities

28
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:08,700
will further enhance hygienic conditions.

29
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:10,720
The way it works is simple.

30
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,480
Shallow trenches are dug.

31
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,900
People defecate into the trenches.

32
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:19,390
There needs to be a manager of the field that
can provide safety and decommissions a trench

33
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,580
when it is full by covering it with the dug
soil.

34
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:28,050
After the use of this technology, the soil
needs to be secured from the community and

35
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:30,600
finally treated.

36
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,620
This method can be a suitable option in the
immediate aftermath of a crisis, due to the

37
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:39,530
low complexity and low capital costs involved.

38
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:44,290
It can be constructed with very simple tools
and materials in a short period of time in

39
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:46,080
less than a day.

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,069
However, this solution should be quit after
a couple of days, as it is not considered

41
00:02:51,069 --> 00:02:57,660
an improved and safe sanitation technology
and does not provide the security and accessibility

42
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:04,349
of an improved toilet as required by Sphere
standard 2 on excreta management.

43
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:09,220
The risk of cross contamination still exists,
as flies and other vectors cannot be kept

44
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,330
out.

45
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:15,459
The land used needs to be rehabilitated afterwards,
which can be very costly.

46
00:03:15,459 --> 00:03:20,200
About 0.25 m2 of land is needed per user per
day.

47
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,320
This is about half a football field for 10’000
inhabitants per day.

48
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:31,610
This adds up very quickly over the course
of time and is therefore not a long term solution.

49
00:03:31,610 --> 00:03:34,670
Slightly improved solutions are deep trench
latrines.

50
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:42,849
For this technology a deep trench of approximatively
1.5-3 meters is dug and several dry toilet

51
00:03:42,849 --> 00:03:47,370
user interfaces consisting of a simple slab
are built upon.

52
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:52,330
The pit needs lining in order to prevent it
from collapsing.

53
00:03:52,330 --> 00:03:57,220
This image shows how a deep trench latrine
can be lined with corrugated plastic sheets

54
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:59,049
and wood pillars.

55
00:03:59,049 --> 00:04:04,020
This can also be done with local materials
such as corrugated sheet iron.

56
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:08,790
This technology has the advantage of quick
implementation time with local materials and

57
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,700
low skills and capacity requirements.

58
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,479
However, like all pit technologies it is not
suited for areas with a high groundwater table

59
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:20,680
or rocky, unstable or clay soils.

60
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,529
There is no ventilation possible and therefore
flies and odors remain a nuisance.

61
00:04:26,529 --> 00:04:31,180
Sludge in a public deep trench latrine will
accumulate very fast and feasible emptying

62
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,550
and transport solutions are therefore needed.

63
00:04:34,550 --> 00:04:39,369
Bear in mind that a deep trench latrine is
not considered an improved toilet facility

64
00:04:39,369 --> 00:04:45,139
and should only be implemented in the acute
phase of an emergency when no other solutions

65
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:47,650
are possible.

66
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:52,229
A new service option that is being tested
by different organisations is container-based

67
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:54,059
toilets.

68
00:04:54,059 --> 00:05:01,070
Users defecate and urinate into buckets with
a lid and are then emptied on a regular basis.

69
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:05,619
Container-based toilets can be prefabricated
with plastic moulding or constructed out of

70
00:05:05,619 --> 00:05:11,129
readily available materials such as buckets
with a simple user interface.

71
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:16,129
The user interface can be a dry toilet or
a urine diverting dry toilet that separates

72
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:20,180
faeces and urine and collects them in two
different containers.

73
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,659
The main implication of this technology is
that a reliable emptying service needs to

74
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:28,589
be in place as these toilets fill up quickly.

75
00:05:28,589 --> 00:05:34,270
This service can be provided by private companies
and can provide job opportunities for the

76
00:05:34,270 --> 00:05:35,529
affected community.

77
00:05:35,529 --> 00:05:40,180
A big advantage is that the toilets are mobile
and can be used in existing superstructures

78
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,009
with no need for sub-structures.

79
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:45,729
They can also be used within the household.

80
00:05:45,729 --> 00:05:48,479
The mobile toilet can be accessed day and
night.

81
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:53,939
This is a major plus to reduce the risk of
gender-based violence by providing the safety

82
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:55,699
of the private space.

83
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:01,059
Furthermore, it can be used to manage child
faeces an issue often overlooked.

84
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:06,559
They are also appropriate for flooded areas
or where the groundwater table is very high.

85
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:12,339
A major implication is that the system depends
on a high quality and regular collection service

86
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:15,020
and further treatment is needed.

87
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,630
Users need to be well trained and have to
buy-in to this technology.

88
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:23,349
This might require substantial awareness raising
and there is a risk that users could reject

89
00:06:23,349 --> 00:06:26,569
to use this technology.

90
00:06:26,569 --> 00:06:32,330
Chemical toilets are another example of prefabricated,
ready to deploy toilet facilities that can

91
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:37,569
be delivered as a complete unit without need
for further construction on-site.

92
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:42,479
This image shows the deployment of a chemical
toilet on an escape route in the Ukraine.

93
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,879
In this technology, the excreta is hygienised
and stabilized in the toilet with the help

94
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:53,059
of liquid chemicals, such as Formaldehyde
and Glutaraldehyde.

95
00:06:53,059 --> 00:06:57,770
There are also biological degradable solutions
that don’t have disinfecting properties

96
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:00,830
but can help reduce odors and unpleasant smells.

97
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:06,180
These types of toilets are usually public
and not suitable for private households.

98
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,169
Here, we are installing mobile latrines.

99
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:19,379
What we are trying to [inaudible], avoid people
going to the grass; going into the forest.

100
00:07:19,379 --> 00:07:25,279
and i think that will save lives.

101
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:30,080
In the short video from Ukraine you just saw,
the toilets were installed, because the forest

102
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,139
along the road was a mine field and therefore
people couldn’t go there for defecation.

103
00:07:35,139 --> 00:07:40,330
The big advantage of chemical toilets is that
they can be mobilized rapidly, if there is

104
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,069
a service provider in the region.

105
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:48,669
So far this is rather uncommon outside of
Europe, North America and parts of Latin America,

106
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:52,840
but mobile toilet businesses of different
kinds are emerging.

107
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:57,680
The toilets are usually well accepted,
And they are very appropriate where digging

108
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,749
a pit is not possible.

109
00:07:59,749 --> 00:08:05,139
However, chemical toilets are NOT a long-term
solution and need to be replaced with a complete

110
00:08:05,139 --> 00:08:06,989
sanitation system.

111
00:08:06,989 --> 00:08:11,289
They need daily servicing and therefore a
service provider.

112
00:08:11,289 --> 00:08:15,860
This can become very costly or impossible
if such a provider does not exist.

113
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:20,879
Furthermore, a waste water treatment plant
is needed to treat this sludge and laws and

114
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,919
regulations need to be in favor of dumping
the human waste from such toilets into waste

115
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,779
water treatment plants.

116
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:34,180
A borehole latrine is a technology that is
used mainly in the acute response phase, when

117
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:39,510
a large number of latrines need to be constructed
rapidly and the site conditions do not allow

118
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,570
for excavation of bigger pits.

119
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:46,600
With a borehole driller available, this can
be a quick way of digging a great number of

120
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,389
latrines within a short period of time.

121
00:08:50,389 --> 00:08:53,990
A dry toilet can be used as a user interface
on top.

122
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,329
The borehole is then used like any other pit.

123
00:08:56,329 --> 00:09:03,660
A lining of the pipe in the top section is
also required, especially with unstable soil.

124
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:08,680
For obvious reasons this technology can only
be implemented with a borehole driller available

125
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:10,130
onsite.

126
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:16,970
If so, it is very inexpensive and quick to
construct, easily understood and only requires

127
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:18,800
a small workforce.

128
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,300
The requirements for the superstructure remain
the same as with any other pit based technology.

129
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:29,079
As there is no ventilation, possible odors
and flies are often a problem.

130
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:34,070
The toilets are not suited for unstable soils
and high groundwater tables.

131
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:38,200
Also the lifespan of a borehole latrine can
be quite short and therefore a new system

132
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,779
is needed soon after their construction.

133
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:46,310
Lime treatment can be used for faecal sludge
treatment.

134
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:51,490
Lime is a fine white powder, of which a sufficient
amount is added to sludge and then mixed in

135
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:52,940
a container.

136
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:56,440
This increases the pH to 12.

137
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:02,190
A high pH over enough time disinfects the
sludge and slows down or stops biological

138
00:10:02,190 --> 00:10:05,410
processes responsible for odors.

139
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:12,040
As mixing is crucial to the process the technology
usually consists of a tank and a mixing device.

140
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:18,100
On this image an open tank is used and lime
is added and mixed manually.

141
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:23,120
Workers are wearing protective gear, as there
is a potential health risk if not handled

142
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,120
properly.

143
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:29,750
The correct combination of dosage and retention
time of lime is crucial for this treatment

144
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:34,220
and depends on the total solids of the sludge
and other chemical characteristics.

145
00:10:34,220 --> 00:10:40,850
Therefore the local faecal sludge has to be
tested in order to determine the correct dosage.

146
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:46,889
Typically it is around 20-35% of lime per
dry mass of sludge.

147
00:10:46,889 --> 00:10:53,009
Lime costs around 100-800 US dollars per ton
in different countries.

148
00:10:53,009 --> 00:10:57,449
Lime treatment is useful due to the short
treatment time of the sludge.

149
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:02,279
The process is simple and uses materials that
are usually locally available.

150
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:08,000
But it has to be noted that pathogen regrowth
will occur again once the pH drops below 11

151
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:16,310
and therefore lime treatment is rather a temporary
stabilisation than a long term solution.

152
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:21,009
In this video we learned about different feasible
technologies that can be used during an acute

153
00:11:21,009 --> 00:11:23,769
humanitarian crisis.

154
00:11:23,769 --> 00:11:27,769
Technologies that can be implemented quickly,
that mostly use locally available materials,

155
00:11:27,769 --> 00:11:33,810
that can be replicated and upgraded and that
serve a large number of people are preferred.

156
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:36,000
Thank you very much for your attention.

157
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,699
And i hope to exchange with you on the forum
about different technologies.

158
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:40,489
Thank you very much.
