00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:08,950
Welcome through these video on urban context
in humanitarian crisis.

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:15,709
The learning objectives of these videos are;
to understand why urban conflicts are so important

3
00:00:15,709 --> 00:00:20,630
in today's humanitarian crisis, to understand
the concept of urban

4
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:26,769
essential services
and finally we discuss on the underlying vulnerabilities

5
00:00:26,769 --> 00:00:29,980
of urban areas.

6
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:34,270
The world is getting more urban and the conflicts
as well.

7
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:40,720
Some fifty million people worldwide are afflicted
by armed conflicts in urban areas.

8
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:46,510
In addition, it is also estimated that eighty
percent of displaced people find refuge in

9
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,320
urban areas.

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,320
On top of that, there is a sharp increase
of protracted conflicts all around the world

11
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:59,140
resulting in an unprecedented level of
humanitarian needs.

12
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:03,850
Protracted conflict seen urban areas is a
challenge for humanitarian response.

13
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:09,010
Indeed humanitarian approach has been
many designed to address needs in camps or

14
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:11,080
rural contexts.

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,320
There is a lack of expertise
and knowledge for urban settings.

16
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,500
In addition current funding mechanism
and program in both million a yearly basis

17
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:24,440
are not adapted to respond to humanitarian
crises due to protracted

18
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:27,080
come conflicts.

19
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,840
Urban areas are undoubtedly complex and so
in it's definition as well.

20
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,960
Tokyo and the village of two thousand people
in Angola are both of usually classified as

21
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,960
urban.

22
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,870
There is clearly no agreed definition of the
term.

23
00:01:43,870 --> 00:01:47,620
Definition of urban are normally based on
population density

24
00:01:47,620 --> 00:01:51,650
or geographic area defined by municipal authorities.

25
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:55,210
In this course we adopt a different approach.

26
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:00,530
We propose that for humanitarian action urban
context to be defined as the

27
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:08,369
area within which civilians vulnerable to
the distruption in essential services reside.

28
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:14,000
And the network of complements supporting
their services.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,420
As shown in this figure, critical components
of essential services for instance electrical

30
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:24,680
power plants, supply routes
water and wastewater treatment plants are

31
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,260
often located outside the city limits.

32
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:35,269
Very distant active combat can verse have
a dramatic effect on urban dwellers.

33
00:02:35,269 --> 00:02:40,150
Essential urban services are understood to
be those services that are vital to ensure

34
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:46,200
the subsistence of the civilian
population including electricity, water, health,

35
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,700
waste water treatment and solid waste disposal.

36
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:58,189
All are banned services require three elements
in order to function.

37
00:02:58,189 --> 00:02:59,189
People.

38
00:02:59,189 --> 00:03:03,069
Meaning service providers staff, private sector
contractors or entrepreneurs

39
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:04,340
Hardware.

40
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:09,360
meaning the infrastructure but as well the
equipment and the machinery.

41
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,780
And consumables.

42
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,180
Meaning the fuel, the medicines etc.

43
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,870
Disruption to an essential servce occurs when
the function of any of the critical people,

44
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:24,489
hardware
or consumable are compromised.

45
00:03:24,489 --> 00:03:29,489
Shut down distruption to an essential service
may not have a major impact on the survival

46
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:31,269
of the Syrian population.

47
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:32,269
Why?

48
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:34,699
It's a
deterioration over the long term pose a greater

49
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:42,040
risk as we see later on
Urban areas are very complex and characterized

50
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,849
by a number of features which result in the
residents being particularly exposed

51
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:50,019
and vulnerable to armed conflict.

52
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:57,849
The main vulnerability of people in urban
context is their reliance on essential services.

53
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:03,599
The services are beyond the technical capacity
of the direct physical control of the residents.

54
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,209
It affect the resilience
of the inhabitants.

55
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:12,129
The essential services consist of sophisticated
large scale infrastructure which rely on the

56
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:15,839
virility of special
expertise, a potentially fragile governance

57
00:04:15,839 --> 00:04:20,560
structures or complex logistics.

58
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,460
Some essential services depend on others simply
not there to not to fail.

59
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,909
For instance, let's say the quality of health
services we depend on potable water on the

60
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:34,190
consumable and reliable power supply.

61
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:39,040
Another example ground water, which can be
as well contaminated by a properly maintained

62
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,840
landfill site.

63
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,180
Another factor affecting the vulnerability
is the scale.

64
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,789
Because of the relatively large special scale
of urban

65
00:04:48,789 --> 00:04:53,980
context, distruption to
an essential service can have a large scale

66
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,980
impact.

67
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,870
The destruction of a single power line can
result in an electricity

68
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:05,000
blackout across an entire neighborhood comprising
maybe two hundred thousand people.

69
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,970
Finally densely populated urban areas are
not only at greater risk from epidemic, there

70
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,500
are also setting in
which people can more readily clash with each

71
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:19,990
other along opposing political, sectarian
or tribal lines

72
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:25,889
or across musical political borders as well
the authorities.

73
00:05:25,889 --> 00:05:32,030
Humanitarian response in urban areas is a
major challenge of today's humanitarian crisis.

74
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,169
In other to summarize this introduction on
urban context.

75
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:36,819
Let's watch the following I.C.R.C.

76
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:38,849
Documentary on urban challenges.

77
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:46,100
Supplying water in an urban environment
is a unique, complex challenge.

78
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,970
Water is usually concentrated in one place
and is pumped

79
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,450
or otherwise taken
from its source to be treated.

80
00:05:54,450 --> 00:06:03,270
All it takes is for a bomb to hit
the pumping station or water pipe,

81
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,950
and the supply to 100,000 people
is cut off.

82
00:06:08,950 --> 00:06:17,280
Sadly, water supplies often
become strategic targets in conflict.

83
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,290
You cut the water and
you immediately drive people away.

84
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,910
The ICRC has a key role to play.

85
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:35,240
Firstly by reminding the parties to
the conflict to spare such infrastructure,

86
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:42,560
and secondly by restoring water supplies
when they are cut.

87
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,000
We have to be very creative.

88
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:58,490
We successfully built
a waste-water treatment plant

89
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,790
serving more than 150,000 people
in the city of Rafah.

90
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,510
Our engineers had the ingenious idea

91
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:17,290
of using bits of the old wall between
Egypt and the Gaza Strip

92
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:22,490
to lay the foundations
for the treatment pools.

93
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:26,530
It gave people hope to see that

94
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:32,490
it was still possible to do something
in Gaza despite the blockade.

95
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:38,940
that also enabled us to begin talks
with the Israeli authorities.

96
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:46,510
We succeeded in bringing in the machinery
needed to complete the treatment plant.

97
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,540
No power means no water.

98
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:53,760
It was a major challenge for the ICRC
to restore power.

99
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:01,460
during the fighting,
power cuts were frequent.

100
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:09,000
On several occasions,
for their own safety,

101
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:15,940
the ICRC escorted technicians
from Gaza city to installations.

102
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:20,490
Their job was to put damaged electricity
poles back up

103
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:22,980
and restore the power supply.

104
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:31,270
a gaza without power is a Gaza
without water

105
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:34,520
and without functioning hospitals.

106
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:38,308
It's straightaway a humanitarian disaster.

107
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:45,250
There is a direct correlation between
water shortages or poor-quality water

108
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,960
and diseases such as cholera.

109
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,930
We see this time and time again.

110
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,280
Whenever people face water shortages

111
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,000
or the water has not been treated
properly,

112
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,480
we immediately see outbreaks of disease.

113
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:09,500
Working in an urban setting means
trying to improve water supplies.

114
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:15,970
We do this in partnership with
the national,

115
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:21,540
regional and local water boards.

116
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,520
Their staff have often had to leave
the country because of conflict

117
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,550
and have to be retrained with our help.

118
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:35,250
the key here is communication,
dialogue and mutual understanding

119
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:41,330
both with the parties to the conflict
and with public services.

120
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:46,990
In Haiti, the ICRC's role was vital.

121
00:09:46,990 --> 00:09:49,760
For years, we oversaw the installation

122
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,960
and repair of water supply points
in Cité-Soleil.

123
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:58,940
At the time, the neighbourhood
was controlled by gangs

124
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:02,270
and the authorities were unable to enter.

125
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:04,180
The ICRC also gave the authorities

126
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:07,540
the confidence to start working there
again.

127
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:11,460
Initially, we accompanied them when
they entered the neighbourhood

128
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:15,940
to repair the water-supply network.

129
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:23,490
We were the only ones able to carry out
such a large-scale project.

130
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,930
We're talking about providing
200,000 people with drinking water

131
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,930
for several years, thanks to this project.

132
00:10:31,930 --> 00:10:35,490
The authorities have now almost
fully resumed control.

133
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:44,040
they enter the neighbourhood unaccompanied
and make repairs without ICRC help.

134
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:51,060
One of the trends observed by the ICRC
is rampant urbanization.

135
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,500
More and more neighbourhoods
are springing up

136
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,970
on the outskirts of cities

137
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,520
Public services cannot keep up.

138
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,950
Water supplies are often non-existent
or very inefficient.

139
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,510
The supply network often breaks down

140
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:09,480
and these are areas where tensions
often erupt.

141
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,280
This trend is set to continue.

142
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,910
We must maintain our expertise

143
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:20,940
and be ready to enter these neighbourhoods
to install or restore the water supply,

144
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:25,200
or to get the authorities in charge
to do so.

145
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,240
The results speak for themselves.

146
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,740
Restoring water to a frightened community,

147
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:34,490
facing the fatal consequences
of a lack of water,

148
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:41,240
is hugely satisfying.
