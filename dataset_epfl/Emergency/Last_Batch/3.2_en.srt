1
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:07,470
Previously, you learned different functional
groups.

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,380
Today I would like to talk in more detail
about the first functional group – water

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,980
sources.

4
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:20,980
We will get familiar with the water cycle
and different water sources, identify major

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:25,609
criteria for choosing a water source, get
familiar with immediate and long-term measures

6
00:00:25,609 --> 00:00:32,960
needed and understand the advantages, limitations
and sensitivities of different water sources.

7
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,640
Lets look at the natural water cycle.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,090
Rainwater falls onto the ground.

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:41,670
When collected directly from an available
roof structure or a constructed ground catchment

10
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,810
area can supplement other sources of water
even if it is not used as the main water supply.

11
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:52,850
Rain water becomes surface water as soon as
it reaches the ground.

12
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,769
Directly or as surface runoff it accumulates
in surface depressions.

13
00:00:56,769 --> 00:01:02,179
While lakes, reservoirs or ponds are standing
or slow-moving water bodies, rivers or streams

14
00:01:02,179 --> 00:01:06,890
flow by gravity across the land towards the
sea or another river or lake.

15
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:11,360
Surface water is the easiest source to access,
but not necessarily the easiest source to

16
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,680
use for water supply.

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,110
Rainwater falling onto the ground infiltrates
through the soil, fractures and openings in

18
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:25,430
rock until it reaches the water table and
joins the groundwater flow system.

19
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:30,290
The geological formation or layer consisting
of pervious materials and conducting water

20
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:31,290
is called aquifer.

21
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:36,050
There is always a balance between the amount
of water stored in an aquifer, the volume

22
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:40,630
of water which leaves the aquifer through
natural groundwater flow and abstraction by

23
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,290
pumping and the amount of water it receives
through recharge.

24
00:01:44,290 --> 00:01:48,920
If the balance is negative and excessively
more water is pumped than recharged, pumping

25
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:54,420
will increasingly become more expensive and
the well eventually will run dry.

26
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,619
How do we select a water source?

27
00:01:56,619 --> 00:02:00,630
First we need to identify water sources which
could be used without tinkering.

28
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:04,920
For each source, we consider four major criteria:
1.

29
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:09,369
Water quantity – what is a yield of the
water source and how does it relates to the

30
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:10,369
demand?

31
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,250
Is the source intermittent or strongly affected
by seasonality?

32
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:18,020
The minimum yield of the water source should
still be greater than demand.

33
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,769
If this is not the case, combination of several
sources to cover demand should be considered.

34
00:02:23,769 --> 00:02:27,260
Sufficient storage capacity might help to
improve reliability of supply.

35
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:33,040
While this open well is full throughout the
year, during few month of the dry season,

36
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,560
water level sinks considerably.

37
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,000
Water quality.

38
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:44,790
Obviously, it is always advisable to choose
the source with the better water quality.

39
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,569
Surface water and often karstic springs are
likely to be affected by increased turbidity

40
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:53,560
and organic matter content, especially during
rain events.

41
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,080
High content of particles and organic matter
complicates water disinfection and overall

42
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,400
water treatment system.

43
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,510
Groundwater is rather likely to have low turbidity
and lower content of pathogenic microorganisms

44
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,790
compared to surface waters.

45
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:12,099
Although the goal is always to provide sufficient
amount of good quality water, it is not always

46
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:14,840
possible in an emergency context.

47
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,129
If there is an alternative, large quantities
of reasonably good quality water should always

48
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:24,390
be preferred to small quantities of very good
quality water.

49
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:29,590
Consider how water quality is and will be
affected in future by sanitation practices,

50
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:33,150
agriculture and possible point contamination
sources.

51
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:41,010
On this picture you see that water is obviously
turbid, and obviously is used by animals.

52
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:48,720
The third criteria is the type of the technology
and resources required for exploitation of

53
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,150
the water source.

54
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,799
In all cases – use the help of gravity to
avoid pumping water, if you can.

55
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,190
If technology is available in place, are there
also skills and qualified people for source

56
00:03:59,190 --> 00:04:03,050
exploitation and for future maintenance?

57
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:07,349
The costs of source exploitation including
initial investment, operational and maintenance

58
00:04:07,349 --> 00:04:10,470
costs need to be considered as well.

59
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:14,829
Time required for exploitation of the source
need to be taken into consideration in an

60
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:17,860
emergency context as well.

61
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:22,200
The forth important criteria is accessibility
and acceptance of the source.

62
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:27,260
Any obvious legal, security, social, political
or cultural constrains should be taken into

63
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,410
account.

64
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:32,730
If needed and possible they should be reduced
to a level acceptable to users.

65
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,160
It might take long time to influence or change
a certain culturally influenced behavior in

66
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:38,160
one case.

67
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:43,860
An in another case, sometimes a short intensive
hygiene promotion campaign can be very effective.

68
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:49,360
And the last, use of water source can have
environmental and health impacts which might

69
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,540
not be obvious at a first step.

70
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,790
If you plan for a long term - take environment
into the equation to avoid for example creation

71
00:04:56,790 --> 00:05:02,420
of mosquito breeding places, or consider what
effect a failing dam might have on the downstream

72
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:04,140
population.

73
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:10,940
River is a natural flow of fresh water across
the land towards a sea, another river or lake.

74
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:16,630
A catchment area of a river is the area from
which any particular river receives both surface

75
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:21,120
flow and drainage water originating from precipitation.

76
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,930
Throughout the course of a river, the water
transported downstream is in constant interaction

77
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:31,710
with underlying groundwater system, and may
gain or loose water to groundwater.

78
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:36,970
Seasonal variations, up to complete drying
of a river are expected.

79
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:41,530
Lakes and ponds are standing or slow moving
surface water bodies which form naturally

80
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,500
from rain, surface run-off or river water.

81
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:49,630
Reservoirs are man-made lakes which are created
by flooding the land behind a dam.

82
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:55,210
Besides the interconnection between groundwater
and lake water which depends on soil structure,

83
00:05:55,210 --> 00:06:00,090
losses through evaporation should be taken
into consideration.

84
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:05,550
River and lake water quality is highly variable
by nature due to types of rocks, vegetation,

85
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:12,000
climate, and human activities such as discharge
of wastewater, industrial waste and surface

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,990
run-off from fields.

87
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:19,760
In most cases, the quality of surface water
sources is poor and water requires treatment.

88
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:25,470
An exception can be upstream water close to
the source in mountain areas which can be

89
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:32,440
free of contamination and can be collected
and delivered through simple gravity supply

90
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,680
system.

91
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:38,670
For lakes and ponds, water quality in the
center of the lake might be considerably better

92
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:44,830
than close to the shore due to settling, natural
biological processes and sunlight degrading

93
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,010
contamination.

94
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:52,550
If surface water is affected by poorly treated
industrial wastewater discharge, it should

95
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:58,490
really be considered as the last possible
option as treatment of such water is highly

96
00:06:58,490 --> 00:06:59,490
complex.

97
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,490
Rivers are multiple sources of water and water
is used for irrigation, bathing, washing of

98
00:07:00,490 --> 00:07:01,490
clothes, industry and ecosystem services.

99
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:02,490
Development of water sources through dams
and intakes in many cases cause deterioration

100
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:03,490
of its quality, limited access of the downstream
population and degradation of ecosystem services

101
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,490
with numerous negative consequences.

102
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:07,250
Groundwater flowing naturally from the earth
subsurface to the surface forms a spring.

103
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,520
Flow may be identified at a certain point
which is called spring eye.

104
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,240
If it is rather more diffuse area, it is called
seepage.

105
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:20,900
The locations of the springs can change due
to changes in the water table during the dry

106
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,900
and wet season.

107
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:26,650
Green vegetation contrasting to the surrounding
sometimes can help to identify the springs

108
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:27,650
at a distance.

109
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:33,470
Otherwise, reading and understanding of geological
maps as well as practical experience will

110
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,930
be necessary to locate the springs.

111
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:36,200
Compared to other water sources, tapping springs
is rather cheap considering that construction

112
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,200
costs are comparably low and no pump is needed
for water abstraction.

113
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:41,830
A good well requires an appropriate source
of groundwater, but locating it is difficult.

114
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:47,110
Like surface water, ground water flow is influenced
by gravity, unless it meets less permeable

115
00:07:47,110 --> 00:07:48,110
rock.

116
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:52,250
Thus, obviously, groundwater is likely to
be closer to the surface in the bottom of

117
00:07:52,250 --> 00:07:55,370
the valley than on top of a mountain.

118
00:07:55,370 --> 00:07:59,780
However, siting a well usually will require
a hydrogeologist with considerable practical

119
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:06,360
expertise, information on the local geological
formations and good luck.

120
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:11,810
Existing records on the available dug wells
and boreholes with soil data, yield and depth

121
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:16,930
might provide additional information which
can help to site the well.

122
00:08:16,930 --> 00:08:18,600
Having located a good source of groundwater,
we would need to chose an appropriate well

123
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,600
construction method.

124
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,600
The flow of groundwater is slower due to resistance
caused by interconnected system of pores,

125
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,600
spaces, fractures and varies from few meters
per day to few meters per year.

126
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:22,600
It depends also on the hydraulic gradient.

127
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,600
The result of the slow movement of water is
that there is sufficient time to dissolve

128
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:24,600
chemicals from the rocks and soils it passes
through.

129
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,600
Water spending long time underground in rather
soluble rock areas will have higher total

130
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
dissolved solids which can lead to the increased
salinity of water.

131
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,600
Thus, salinity values measured by conductivity
probes might give an indication on the risks

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,600
caused by pit latrines and other possible
relevant sources of contamination.

133
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,600
Once groundwater is polluted, it is very difficult
to restore its quality.

134
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,600
Rainwater can be collected from roofs and
stored in rain water tank or collected as

135
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
surface run-off in rainwater catchment dams
or reservoirs.

136
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,450
It is rarely used as a major water source,
but rather to supplement existing sources.

137
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,110
The quality of rain water collected from the
roofs is usually good if it is collected through

138
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,550
an adequate rain water harvesting system,
properly stored and supplied.

139
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:45,550
Improper roofing materials, roof contamination
through bird droppings, dust and insects,

140
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:46,550
luck of first flush mechanism, poor collection
and storage design will inevitably lead to

141
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,550
recontamination, poor water quality as well
as algal growth and mosquito breeding in storage

142
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:48,550
tanks.

143
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,360
Seawater has a salinity of 3.5% meaning that
every liter of water contains 35 g of salt

144
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,910
per liter.

145
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:59,200
Total dissolved solids content is usually
used to describe the content of salt and minerals.

146
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:05,270
Brackish water forming usually in the areas
of mixing of salt water and fresh water, such

147
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:14,500
as estuaries or in groundwater has a TDS between
1000-10000 mg/L. To remove salt from water,

148
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,570
desalination is required.

149
00:09:16,570 --> 00:09:17,771
Desalination has high energy demand.

150
00:09:17,771 --> 00:09:18,771
Concentrated salt solution is produced as
a waste stream during some desalination processes

151
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:19,771
requires careful disposal, as it can lead
to strong deterioration of the environment

152
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:20,771
and cause risk of salinization of other groundwater
and surface water sources.

153
00:09:20,771 --> 00:09:23,590
Due to high costs, high maintenance requirements
of desalination technologies, it is usually

154
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:30,080
advisable to consider desalination as the
last possible option and chose other available

155
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,080
sources.

156
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:34,380
To sum up:
- Water quantity, quality, technology required

157
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:39,140
for exploitation as well as accessibility
and acceptance are the major criteria we use

158
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,340
to chose a water source
- Surface waters are likely to be polluted

159
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:48,890
and often affected by seasonality
- Finding groundwater is not easy and requires

160
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:50,830
expertise.

161
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,460
Protection of sources needed.

162
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:58,870
- Desalination of sea or brackish waters as
well as using industrially polluted waters

163
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,700
should be the last possible option
