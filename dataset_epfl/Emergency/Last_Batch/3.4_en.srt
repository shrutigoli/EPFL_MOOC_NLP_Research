00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:05,319
Hello.

2
00:00:05,319 --> 00:00:10,170
Water abstraction involves collecting raw
water at the source intake system and transporting

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:15,669
it to the treatment plant, storage tank, distribution
network or directly to the consumer, depending

4
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:17,540
on the scale and design of the system.

5
00:00:17,540 --> 00:00:23,199
Today we will look at different water abstraction
technologies, such as gravity supplies, pump

6
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:25,779
types and energy sources needed to drive them.

7
00:00:25,779 --> 00:00:30,449
We consider in more detail the basic working
principles of different pump types as well

8
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:32,340
as their applicability and limitations.

9
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,930
Finally, we will look at how to read and understand
the pump curves needed for selecting and specifying

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:44,140
an appropriate pump and consider main factors
influencing operation of a pumping station.

11
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:48,129
The best way to abstract water in many cases
is by using gravity.

12
00:00:48,129 --> 00:00:52,820
Gravity flow water supply is a system in which
water falls due to its own weight from a source

13
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,250
situated above, to the users below.

14
00:00:55,250 --> 00:00:59,500
The process is driven by the potential energy
water has due to its elevation.

15
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:04,769
Due to missing moving parts, relative simplicity
of the system, the gravity water supply schemas

16
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:09,070
do not require complex maintenance and are
rather robust and reliable.

17
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:13,770
To design a gravity flow water supply system
you would need to calculate the pipe diameter

18
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:19,000
required, considering the elevation difference
and losses due to friction in the pipe as

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,780
well as energy losses produced by turbulence
introduced by everything which is not straight:

20
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:26,780
valves, elbows, reductions.

21
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,990
Furthermore, you would need to study the topography
of the system to minimize high and low points

22
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:37,579
which can lead to the air trapping or accumulation
of sediments and to avoid negative pressures.

23
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:41,210
Break-pressure tanks might be required if
heights difference is considerable.

24
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:46,540
There are few softwares and freeware available,
which can help you to design a gravity flow

25
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:47,540
system, without having a full understanding
of the system hydraulics.

26
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,470
If location of the water sources and topographical
characteristics of the area do not allow the

27
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:54,939
use of gravity, pumps need to be used.

28
00:01:54,939 --> 00:01:59,969
Pumps are used to lift water against the gravity
or pressurize it to move it through a pipeline

29
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:01,299
at a required flow rate.

30
00:02:01,299 --> 00:02:05,719
A huge variety of technologies have evolved
and have been introduced for different uses

31
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:06,869
and needs.

32
00:02:06,869 --> 00:02:12,200
The pumps are often grouped according to the
type of operation to manual and motorized

33
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,790
pumps.

34
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:17,950
For the motorized pumps, different energy
sources can be used to drive the pump, such

35
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:22,680
as diesel, electricity, wind, solar energy.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,299
Furthermore, considering the method of displacement
of water applied by a pump, we can distinguish

37
00:02:27,299 --> 00:02:33,500
between impulse pumps, positive displacement
pumps and velocity pumps.

38
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:37,770
Hydraulic ram pump uses highs difference and
water hummer effect to develop pressure which

39
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:42,500
allows a part of the input water to be lifted
up higher than the water source without any

40
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:44,669
external energy supply.

41
00:02:44,669 --> 00:02:50,850
Each 1 m difference in the feed pipe, can
pump water almost 30 m up.

42
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,519
Hydraulic ram pumps require two things: a
reliable source of running water and a working

43
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:56,519
fall.

44
00:02:56,519 --> 00:02:59,980
The pump works as follows: Water flows from
the source A by gravity thorough the drive

45
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:04,690
pipe B, picks up speed and kinetic energy
until the increasing drug force closes the

46
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,419
waste valve C. The momentum of the water flow
against the closed waste valve causes water

47
00:03:09,419 --> 00:03:10,419
hummer.

48
00:03:10,419 --> 00:03:14,730
The pressure in the pipe rises, and the check
valve D opens and some water is forced into

49
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,019
the delivery pipe.

50
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,829
With slowing of the movement of water, the
check valve closes, water moves back, and

51
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,560
forward again restarting the process.

52
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,940
The pressure vessel E, contains air to reduce
the hydraulic shock and improving efficiency

53
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,799
by more constant flow of water.

54
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:36,579
These kind of systems work for long time without
any maintenance as long as water is available.

55
00:03:36,579 --> 00:03:41,229
Ram pumps a specially suitable for communities
in hilly areas with water sources located

56
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:45,020
lower than the community or on another side
of the valley.

57
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:52,380
A positive displacement pump makes a fluid
move by trapping a fixed amount and forcing

58
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,180
(displacing) that trapped volume into the
discharge pipe.

59
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,820
Basically, the pump uses a principle of expanding
space or cavity on the suction side and decreasing

60
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,310
cavity on the discharge side.

61
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:10,040
The volume remains constant during one cycle
of operation, which means that theoretically,

62
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,380
positive displacement pumps should produce
the same flow when the speed is constant,

63
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,730
independently on the pressure on the discharge
side.

64
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:21,870
Depending on the type of mechanism used to
move water, the positive displacement pumps

65
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:28,310
can be classified in three major groups: reciprocating
type positive displacement, rotary-type positive

66
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:33,040
displacement and linear type positive displacement.

67
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:38,040
Reciprocating type positive displacement pumps
are commonly used in a number of applications.

68
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:42,310
Many community hand pumps for dug wells and
boreholes are reciprocating piston or plunger

69
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,310
pumps.

70
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:48,010
When water is available less than 7 meters
below ground, suction pumps are often of an

71
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:52,470
interest, as they can be easily accessed at
the ground level to perform maintenance.

72
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:58,530
For deeper wells and boreholes, direct action
hand pumps or high lift hand pumps raising

73
00:04:58,530 --> 00:05:05,150
water from the depth of up to 45or even 100
m can be used.

74
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:09,580
Rotary-type positive displacement pumps use
rotating mechanism that creates vacuum and

75
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,460
captures and draws water.

76
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:16,270
Rotary vane pump consists of vanes placed
in a circular rotor that rotates inside a

77
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,449
circular cavity.

78
00:05:17,449 --> 00:05:22,600
The centers of these two circles are offset,
causing the vanes to slide in and out of rotor

79
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,930
creating chambers.

80
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,190
Progressive cavity pump also known as helical
rotor pump transfers water by progressing

81
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:33,480
it through the sequence of small sized cavities
when rotor turns.

82
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:38,760
These type of pumps are as well fixed flow
pumps, operating at a constant flow rate which

83
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,440
is proportional to the rotation speed and
almost independent on head.

84
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,470
The pumping head is directly proportional
to the power input.

85
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:50,100
This type of pump is robust and is less sensitive
to particles in water than other positive

86
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:53,910
displacement pumps and can be used even to
pump sludge.

87
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:56,690
Abrasive materials will however damage the
pump.

88
00:05:56,690 --> 00:06:01,389
It is quite common pump used for motorized
pumping of water from boreholes.

89
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:06,500
A rope pump is a pump which consists of a
hanging rope placed in the well and drawn

90
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,350
up through a long pipe with the bottom immersed
in water.

91
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,140
Round disks - washers matching the diameter
of the pipe are attached to the rope.

92
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:17,210
Those pull water to the surface.

93
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:22,860
These type of pumps is commonly used in rural
areas on hand dug wells for community or self-supply

94
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,790
of water.

95
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,050
If the positive displacement pumps operate
by manipulating the available space inside

96
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:34,550
the pump, the velocity pumps operate by manipulating
the velocity of the fluid during its movement

97
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:35,580
through the pump.

98
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:41,040
A radial flow pump, also known as centrifugal
pump, first converts energy of a motor first

99
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:45,910
into velocity or better to say, kinetic energy
by a rotating impeller.

100
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:50,690
When impeller rotates, its spins the water
sitting in the cavities between the vanes

101
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,590
outward and provides centrifugal acceleration.

102
00:06:53,590 --> 00:06:59,170
As water leaves, the low pressure area is
creating leading to suction of more water.

103
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:04,090
The kinetic energy of water coming out of
an impeller is afterwards harnessed by creating

104
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,391
resistance to the flow.

105
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:10,950
Water meets a stationary diffuser or volute,
which slows it down and converts the kinetic

106
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,260
energy into the pressure energy.

107
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:19,790
Axial-flow pumps differ from radial flow centrifugal
pumps in principle by the design of the rotating

108
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:20,790
elements.

109
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,919
The axial flow pumps use element similar to
a propeller, which moves (or pushes) water

110
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,800
axially and operate usually at much smaller
pressures and higher flows than centrifugal

111
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
pumps.

112
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,850
Mixed pumps do both – radial acceleration
and pushing of water., and let water exist

113
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:40,830
the impeller between 0 and 90 degrees from
axial direction.

114
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:44,200
This leads to higher operating pressures and
flow rates.

115
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:49,040
Both axial flow and mixed flow pumps are not
very common in emergency water supply applications.

116
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:54,630
A practical difference between velocity and
positive displacement pumps is how they operate

117
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:57,080
under closed valve conditions.

118
00:07:57,080 --> 00:08:01,040
Positive displacement pumps physically displace
fluid, so closing a valve downstream of a

119
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:05,690
positive displacement pump produces a continual
pressure build up that can cause mechanical

120
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,650
failure and damage of pipeline or pump.

121
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,840
Velocity pumps differ in that they can be
safely operated under closed valve conditions.

122
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,830
Due to the different operating principle,
pumping head of positive displacement pump

123
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:22,480
theoretically does not depend on the pump
speed, while for velocity pumps, discharge

124
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:26,200
rates vary considerably with the head against
water is being pumped.

125
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:30,750
That is a reason why you need to read and
understand pump curves if you need to chose

126
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,839
and specify a centrifugal pump.

127
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:38,370
A typical Pump curve has two axes: horizontal
one which shows the flow rate through the

128
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:42,700
pump and vertical one, showing head, also
sometimes called pressure.

129
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:46,839
The first information we can read from any
pump curve is the flow the pump will develop

130
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:49,320
at any given operating head.

131
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:52,620
This curve is called also pump performance
curve.

132
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:57,330
Any piping system used to transport pumped
water can be characterized by a head loss,

133
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:01,520
which as well depends on the flow rate of
water in the system.

134
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,900
Head loss will increase with the flow rate.

135
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:11,520
This red curve is called system characteristics
curve.

136
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,310
The point where the pump performance curve
and system characteristics curves intersect

137
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:19,140
is called pump operating point or duty point.

138
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:24,480
At the duty point, there is a balance between
the system demands and what the pump can deliver.

139
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:31,120
For each pump, the manufacturer of the pump
will define the allowable pump operating range,

140
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,970
indicating the values of Minimum und maximum
flow rate Q min and Q max.

141
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:38,750
The operating point of the pump needs to be
in the operating range of the pump to provide

142
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:41,610
trouble free operation of the pump.

143
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:45,580
For centrifugal pumps, multiple curves can
be pictured on the pump curve.

144
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:50,150
Those show the performance of the pump at
different impeller diameters.

145
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:54,360
Impellers can be trimmed to match the impeller
to the head and flow needed in the application

146
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,080
within the given range.

147
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:01,700
In addition to head and flow, pump curves
will also provide efficiency information.

148
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,100
Efficiency is the relationship between the
input power and the water power being generated

149
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,100
by the pump.

150
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:12,380
Obviously, no pump has 100% efficiency, and
pumps require more input power than water

151
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,580
power generated by the pump.

152
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,390
The best efficiency point on this example
is 60%.

153
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,820
The middle part of the pump curve illustrates
the net positive head required NPSH, which

154
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,790
is basically, the suction characteristics
of the pump at different flows.

155
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,250
Each point along the curve shows the positive
suction head in meters required to avoid for

156
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,690
example cavitation which can damage the pump.

157
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:40,380
As you see on the picture, it does not differ
a lot for different impeller trims.

158
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:45,360
The lowest graph at the bottom of the pump
curve shows usually the power curve.

159
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:50,750
This curve indicates how much power the pump
will require at any particular flow point.

160
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:55,110
This information is useful for calculating
power consumption costs and ensuring that

161
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:58,820
selected motor is suitable for the chosen
pump.

162
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:04,030
Pumping stations belong to many water supply
systems which require delivery of water from

163
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:10,529
source to treatment or distribution network
and it cannot be done by entirely by gravity.

164
00:11:10,529 --> 00:11:14,230
Interruption or a breakdown of a pumping station
leads inevitably to the interruption of the

165
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:17,029
water supply of the entire area.

166
00:11:17,029 --> 00:11:22,640
In order to increase reliability of a pumping
station, adequate standby capacity is required.

167
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,690
Trained operators, regular servicing, reliable
energy sources and spare parts are the major

168
00:11:27,690 --> 00:11:30,020
factors which need to be ensured.

169
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:35,279
Rehabilitation of the pumping stations belongs
to the common activities required in an emergency

170
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:39,550
context, especially in urban and peri-urban
areas affected by the crisis.

171
00:11:39,550 --> 00:11:45,270
While in few cases, provision of fuel can
be already sufficient, in other cases, complex

172
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,330
service, repair and replacement can be required.

173
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:49,500
Hereby you can see a video from Lebanon, illustrating
the rehabilitation of the water pumping systems

174
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,500
in Beqaa.

175
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,140
During this lecture we discussed gravity water
supply, and learned that gravity supplies

176
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:58,399
in hilly areas are usually simple systems
which do not require high degree of maintenance.

177
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,300
Furthermore, we looked at the basic operating
principles and differences of various common

178
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:08,850
types of pumps such as impulse pumps, positive
displacement pumps and velocity pumps and

179
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:12,150
learned how to read pump curves of centrifugal
pumps.

180
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:17,800
Finally we mentioned major factors needed
for reliable operation of a pumping station.

181
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,220
See you during the next lecture.
