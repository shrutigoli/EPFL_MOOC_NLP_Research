00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,000
Hello and welcome to the week on sanitation.

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,360
My name is Samuel Renggli.

3
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:11,180
I work as an Environmental Engineer at Eawag.

4
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,950
And I will guide your through this week.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:18,970
This week on sanitation you will learn about
the method of excreta management in humanitarian

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,970
crises.

7
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,610
You will know which sanitation products you
have to deal with and what functional groups

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:26,230
of sanitation technologies exist.

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:31,020
You will learn what criteria need to be considered
to select the most appropriate technology

10
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:33,700
based on the needs and the context.

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:40,420
In the second part of the week we do a review
of sanitation technologies for the humanitarian

12
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,620
sector.

13
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:45,390
The video lectures you will see this week
are a mix of new videos produced for this

14
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:52,190
course where the topic of sanitation in humanitarian
crises, including excreta management is presented.

15
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:58,440
In addition to the theoretical part, we have
ICRC case studies from Ruanda, Gaza and Liberia

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,559
to illustrate some challenges and practices
of sanitation in the humanitarian sector.

17
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,310
There are some videos that were already featured
in another MOOC by Eawag called Planning & Design

18
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,670
of Sanitation Systems and Technologies ((Insert
link to the MOOC as in-video quiz)).

19
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:17,310
If you are interested to learn more in depth
about sanitation, we recommend enrolling in

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:18,940
that course as well.

21
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:24,299
These videos are presented by my colleagues
Dr. Elizabeth Tilley, Lukas Ulrich and Philippe

22
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:25,749
Reymond.

23
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:30,409
On the Eawag homepage you find other courses
as well on household water treatment and safe

24
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:34,799
storage, solid waste management and faecal
sludge management.

25
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:41,829
The videos use the terminology of the Compendium
of Sanitation Systems and Technologies, a

26
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:43,360
publication by Eawag.

27
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,750
The Compendium presents a huge range of information
on sanitation systems and 57 different technologies.

28
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:57,060
It is currently available in English, French,
Spanish, Arabic, Nepali, Vietnamese and Korean.

29
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,079
Russian will soon be available as well.

30
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,920
The Compendium is currently being revised
and adapted for the humanitarian sector.

31
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:10,009
The update will include more technologies
specific for emergency settings as well as

32
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:12,860
more decision criteria for the humanitarian
context.

33
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,920
It will be published in 2018.

34
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,910
Furthermore there is a range of books and
publications on sanitation in emergencies

35
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:25,860
which you find on the course homepage.

36
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,490
Ensuring public health is the first goal during
any humanitarian crisis.

37
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,310
Sanitation plays an important role in preventing
diseases that can become an epidemic such

38
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,020
as cholera, typhoid and diarrhoea.

39
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:44,560
Transmission of excreta related diseases is
largely through faecal oral transmission,

40
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,050
therefore it is worthwhile to have another
look at the F-Diagram.

41
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:55,010
To ensure public health a multiple action
approach is needed consisting of water supply,

42
00:02:55,010 --> 00:02:57,880
sanitation and hygiene promotion.

43
00:02:57,880 --> 00:03:02,390
Sanitation is the first barrier to avoid faecal
pathogens of entering into the environment,

44
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:03,730
where they can cause disease infection.

45
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:07,230
((Draw the sanitation barrier)).

46
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:10,410
Sanitation has to be always coupled with hand
hygiene promotion.

47
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,650
A toilet facility is only complete with a
handwashing station accessible in an adequate

48
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,860
distance.

49
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,400
This in order to have a secondary barrier
from the hands.

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,500
((Draw handwashing barrier))

51
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,820
The third barrier is clean drinking water
((draw water barrier))

52
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:34,290
Handwashing and water supply are not part
of this week.

53
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:37,850
There is not one sanitation solution that
fits any context.

54
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:43,410
The challenge is to find the most appropriate
sanitation solution for each different context.

55
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:49,130
The context is given by the type and the state
of an emergency as well as the specific geographical

56
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:50,350
context.

57
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:55,220
For example a different sanitation solution
was needed for the acute phase after the earth

58
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,951
quake in April 2015 in Nepal than for the
prolonged humanitarian crisis in the Middle

59
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:03,490
East that is still going on.

60
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:08,250
In the city of Kathmandu, shown on the image
behind me, people from urban settlements were

61
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,260
forced to leave their houses after the earthquake.

62
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:15,910
People were temporarily displaced within the
city or just outside.

63
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:21,230
The existing sanitation infrastructure was
damaged, but not destroyed completely everywhere.

64
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:26,080
The sanitation response was to implement temporary
container based toilets and pit latrines,

65
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:32,930
while the existing infrastructure was rehabilitated
for the needs of Nepali people.

66
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:37,740
The average lifespan of a refugee camp is
20 years.

67
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,790
Therefore sanitation in the Zataari camp in
Jordan is very different from the solution

68
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,220
in Nepal.

69
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:48,790
The camp was constructed in the middle of
the desert for Syrian refugees.

70
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:54,660
As there is no end in sight to the humanitarian
crisis in the Middle East, the sanitation

71
00:04:54,660 --> 00:05:00,070
solutions implemented there are longer term
and improved and upgraded incremental over

72
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,290
time.

73
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:05,720
In summary, the goal of this week is to learn
what criteria to consider

74
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,600
in order to find the most appropriate sanitation
solution

75
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,430
for each state
of each type of humanitarian crisis

76
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,580
in a given context.

77
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:18,220
You will also learn about different sanitation
systems and technologies.

78
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,100
Thank you for your attention.

79
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,130
and I hope to exchange with you in the forum
and I hope that you learned a lot this week.
