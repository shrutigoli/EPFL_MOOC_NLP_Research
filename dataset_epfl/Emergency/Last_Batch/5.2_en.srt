00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,740
Hello to everybody,
I am Hans Mosler.

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:11,270
I'm a professor at the University
of Phyche,

3
00:00:11,270 --> 00:00:17,240
working at the hawack in the department
of environmental social sciences,

4
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:22,010
and I'm the head of the Environmental
and Psychology group.

5
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,540
I would present you the module
about hygiene promotion,

6
00:00:27,540 --> 00:00:31,230
using a systematic behavior
change approach and what this means,

7
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:34,980
I will show you in a
few minutes,

8
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:37,180
but let me share some
experiences

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:41,170
with you first.
There was

10
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:45,809
an implementation of water supply,
but people still

11
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:50,040
used unsafe wells,
I'm referring to Haiti after

12
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,930
the earthquake.
Building of toilets

13
00:00:53,930 --> 00:01:00,039
but nearly no use
or very very inadequate use as you see here.

14
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:01,680
And we
introduced

15
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,039
hand-washing
and there was nearly

16
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:10,840
no or low compliance.
So the question arises,

17
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:16,320
how to introduce behavior change?
We do promotion

18
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,170
of behavior
and expect behavior change.

19
00:01:20,170 --> 00:01:23,600
But there's a
very important statement- Behavior change

20
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:28,350
starts in the head of the people.
What does it mean,

21
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:33,000
that something in the mindset
of the persons has to change.

22
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,890
And what exactly has to change?
We call it factors,

23
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:38,970
behavioral factors
or psychosocial factors,

24
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:41,799
like knowledge,
perceived social pressure,

25
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:44,210
or attitudes,
beliefs about costs

26
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,770
and benefits and so on.
And very important is also

27
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,049
that we make use of
the difference between the doers

28
00:01:53,049 --> 00:01:56,409
and the non-doers because
these are different.

29
00:01:56,409 --> 00:01:59,020
They have to be different because they show
different

30
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:03,610
behaviors.
So here you see

31
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,260
that the doers
and the non-doers are different,

32
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,860
in factor C minus
and in factor B minus.

33
00:02:09,860 --> 00:02:16,730
So, in a first step we need
to identify the behavioral

34
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,680
factors,
in the second step,

35
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,780
then measure
and we want to measure

36
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,860
and calculate these factors.
Then we select the behavior

37
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:29,420
change techniques accordingly,
and accordingly means

38
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:34,040
that we select
behavior change techniques which change

39
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:36,440
C
or B,

40
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,300
A we don't
have to change.

41
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,420
The we design
and implement a software,

42
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,060
and at the end we
want to monitor, we want to evaluate

43
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,709
behavior change
and the behavioral factors.

44
00:02:52,709 --> 00:02:55,980
Whether we really change C
and B,

45
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,660
that's really the point.
So we have

46
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:05,520
four phases,
tools and outputs.

47
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:09,430
The last phase I will not introduce
here, because many times you in

48
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:12,680
emergencies you don't have the time
and the resources.

49
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:16,720
So, I begin
with the first step here:

50
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,920
Identify potential behavioral
and contextual factors.

51
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,290
First, I would like to go
with you tramp

52
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:27,170
with you in the promotional situation
like this one.

53
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:31,190
Imagine you are standing behind this desk
and you are promoting chlorination of

54
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,850
drinking water,
and before

55
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,800
you talk you have to think
what these people think.

56
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,709
So what might it be?
Am I at risk?

57
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:44,930
Why?
How to do it?

58
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,760
How should I do it?
Really.

59
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,290
What does it cost?
What does it bring? Chlorination costs

60
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,580
of course.
Do I like it, do I like to drink chlorinated

61
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,590
water?
What will others say

62
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:00,290
if I chlorine in my water?
Can I do it too

63
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,599
or do I need additional devices?
And how to manage it in in

64
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:09,120
the daily life?
So these thoughts can

65
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,330
easily be arranged
into five

66
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,060
blocks of factors.
Risk factors,

67
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,970
Attitude factors,
Norm factors,

68
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:20,590
Ability factors
and Self-regulation factors,

69
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:26,130
this is the run off model.
Risk factors are a person's understanding

70
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:32,400
and awareness of the health risk.
Attitude factors are of a person's

71
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,050
positive or negative stance towards
the behavior.

72
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,930
Norms factors are the
perceives represent to perceive

73
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,090
social pressure.
And,

74
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,240
Ability factors are
about the confidence a person has

75
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,180
in his or her ability to perform
the behavior.

76
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:56,060
And Self-regulation factors
are a person's attempts

77
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,960
to plan and self monitor
a behavior and to manage conflicting

78
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,620
goals and distracting cues.
On the left side

79
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:09,390
here you see the behavior change
techniques,

80
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,199
from which we know that we
can change exactly this

81
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:17,970
factors here.
These factors are the drivers of behavior.

82
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:21,780
On the right side behavior,
intention and habits.

83
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,490
Down here you have the context,
the moderating context which might influence

84
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:31,930
also the behavior.
I now know which behavior factors

85
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,680
I have to test,
and now I want to

86
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,150
determine measure
and determine these behaviors factors,

87
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:43,030
and we do that with a standardized questionnaire.
We have for example here

88
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,290
the norms
and the others effect other others disapproval.

89
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,180
People who are important to you
do they rather approve

90
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,400
or disapprove if you practice open
defecation,

91
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,030
or if you're using the latrine,
from one nearly all disapprove

92
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:04,850
to five nearly all approve.
Then we do have

93
00:06:04,850 --> 00:06:09,400
doers/non-doers analysis.
You see here the doers are the

94
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,199
latrine users
and the non-doers are the non-users

95
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:16,139
of latrines.
And you'll see for person A to W

96
00:06:16,139 --> 00:06:21,440
the score in perceived effort,
and the score in others approval.

97
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,930
Now we
can calculate the mean score

98
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,139
for both,
and then look

99
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:31,630
how big is the difference.
And here for the perceived effort the difference

100
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:35,090
is not that big,
so we can

101
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:39,350
leave this factor.
But the difference in

102
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,789
others approval,
there's a big difference.

103
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:45,370
So we have to target exactly this
factor.

104
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,820
OK.
We know now the behavioral factors

105
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,539
which we have to change,
now we select the behavior change techniques.

106
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,230
This we do we the catalog
of 36 behavior change

107
00:06:57,230 --> 00:07:01,410
techniques. This is just quite
new for you,

108
00:07:01,410 --> 00:07:05,770
that there's a catalog of behavior change
techniques. Normally you have a program

109
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,889
like C L T S
or C H C

110
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:11,180
or FAST,
but this is a catalog.

111
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:16,289
And the advantage here
is that for each of these

112
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:19,630
factors behavioral factors
you have behavior

113
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:24,840
change techniques which we know
that you can change this factor with.

114
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:28,130
So for example,
other behavior from public

115
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,960
commitment let people commit to
a favorite behavior

116
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,740
and make their commitment public.
Yes,

117
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:40,630
36 behavior change techniques
cover all the RANA's factors.

118
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,509
To conclude
here,

119
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:47,949
systematic behavior change enables you
first, to exactly determine

120
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:52,699
the behavior effect of which you have to change.
This is very very tailored to

121
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:57,540
your target population.
Then you have a focused selection of

122
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:02,030
the corresponding behavior change strategies.
And if you want,

123
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:06,020
you can also prove
the record of success by

124
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,080
the evaluation step which I did not present
so far.

125
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,129
How to apply it in
emergencies?

126
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:16,690
Well the key principles
are take into account all

127
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:21,139
sorts of behavioral factors,
not only health risk factors,

128
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:24,729
but also attitude norms,
abilities,

129
00:08:24,729 --> 00:08:29,900
and self-regulation factors.
And perform the doer/non-doer

130
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,829
analysis,
asked both

131
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:37,950
kind of people.
And I would also

132
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,440
differentiate between
the acute phase,

133
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:46,790
the immediate response,
and in established settings like in camps.

134
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,970
For the immediate response,
you might do a rapid

135
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:54,880
assessment by conducting
a qualitative analysis

136
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:59,130
with 10 doers and 10 non-doers.
Or without any

137
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:03,060
evidence you apply behavior
change techniques out

138
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,270
of these five blocks,
you choose

139
00:09:06,270 --> 00:09:10,690
two of each effect block
and apply these behavioral change

140
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,220
techniques without any evidence,
that's also possible.

141
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,390
In established settings,
you have time and resources I think,

142
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,370
then you conduct a survey
with hundred doers

143
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:22,480
and hundred non-doers,
and apply step

144
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,440
one, two, three or even four
of the RANA's approach.

145
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:32,420
Have a closer look at our own
guidelines about the systematic

146
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:36,880
change approach.
You can download it on our

147
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:39,490
Web page
and go through it

148
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,560
and get more
used to this kind of approach.

149
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,499
Thank you.
