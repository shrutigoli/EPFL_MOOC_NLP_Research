In the previous video, we have seen how to classify, quantify and map the different waste produced in a health care facility.
In this video, you will learn about the different stages of medical waste management.
Since there is no universal answer, we will also discuss how to choose between various management systems and identify good and bad practices.
Medical Waste Management can be divided in five main stages:
The first stage is the Segregation:
The sorting of the waste in the established categories must always be the responsibility of the person who produce it.
Usually a clinical staff member.
Ideally as soon as the waste is produced, it has to be disposed.
It must be done as close as possible to the site where the waste is produced.
Of course, it worthy to mention that if the waste is separated it means that the treatment will be different.
There is no point in sorting wastes that eventually undergoes the same treatment process.
The second stage is the Temporary Storage:
Waste must be collected regularly.
It must never be allowed to accumulate where it is produced.
The volume , the capacity of the containers, and the frequency of collection are the main parameters to account.
The third stage is the Transport â€¦to the waste area: The waste are separated in categories is transported to the waste area.
In a way that reduces the possibility of accidents such as spillages for example
The fourth stage is the Treatment:
According to the system in place, the waste need to be reduced in volume or made not hazardous anymore.
To reduce the public health risk such treatment should be the responsibility of hospital and done on site.
If no appropriate treatment infrastructure exists in the vicinity.
Finally, the disposal.
The final and definitive step.
Usually it consists in buring it in a sanitary landfill or in waste pit.
Here, an example of a plan with a specific solution for each category and each stage.
Note that general waste is not included because if not mixed with infectious one it does not pose any risk.
The one presented here are solutions typically encountered in a low income settings.
How do you come up with the most appropriate plan?
Well, thatâ€™s indeed the tricky part.
Every context requires adaptation.
National legislation, when existing, must lead the way.
When a legislation is not available, resources exist to support the decision making process
Here, a decisional tree proposed by the ICRC
Here others examples of decisional trees by the WHO,
This scenario illustrates an urban area with access to modern treatment facilities
This one an urban area WITHOUT access to treatment facilities
This applies to a peri-urban location and finally a rural one.
You can later go through each on them in details.
What is common to all these decisional trees is:
The existence or not of national regulations,
The availability of treatment facilities in the area,
The space readiness,
The proximity of neighbor communities
And the existing financial and human resources.
The specific steps in the process may vary.
The objective is always the same: safely reduce the risk of infection spreading.
So finally, how does a system of medical waste management look like?
How do you do if you have to get rid of sharp objects such as needles, scalpel or broken glass?
Here one system for Sharps in low income settings.
We need to start with the segregation.
The simplest option might be to use only a
Safety box.
A paper carton box, widely available everywhere in the world, specifically designed and labelled to transport sharp waste.
Safety Boxes need to be transported into the waste area.
They can be incinerated and finally the ashes and the remaining needles disposed into a sharp pit.
The operations behind each step need to be correctly performed.
Hospital staff need to be properly equipped and trained.
For example segregation requires to strictly separate the different categories.
If this is not done, the consequence is simple: all the steps down the line cannot work anymore.
You can see two examples.
One of a bad triage.
And another of a well-organized nurse trolley with the proper medical waste containers ready for segregation immediately after the generation of the waste.
Same applies for all the other steps.
Here you see, a bad example of storage, while there, a good one.
Let me stress what is the point here: the first picture is an example of bad practice, not because it shows an environment dirty and not well kept, but because it does not accomplish to principle of reducing the risk for the users of the health facility.
Those boxes left unattended, are a temptation for the kids, they can easy spill over and therefore requiring remediation procedures, which are adding extra risks.
Again, guess in which picture it is easier to have an accidental spill over of the sharp box?
Sometimes, very simple and low cost solutions like a trolley, with a flat bed and security railings can have huge impacts in reduction of accidents.
No need to be always fancy!
Same question: which practice, in the pictures, do you think entails less risk?
We have finally arrived in the waste area.
A space that needs to be controlled and properly equipped.
Clearly there are some practices that are not recommended and they can be extremely dangerous for the operators and the surrounding community.
The slow burning here is extremely unsafe.
A dangerous exposure to dioxins.
Maybe at this point, it is important to distinguish between burning and incineration.
Burning is a thermal oxidation of waste able to produce a reduction of the volume but not is decontamination.
Only when incineration conditions are reached, we can talk about destruction of the pathogen load in the waste.
Oxygen, air flow, temperature and retention time they should be in the right mix to allow incineration to happen.
Iâ€™d like to stress a point that often come up.
Medical Waste Management is often assimilated with Incineration only.
Sometimes building or providing a new incinerator is seen as a kind of miracle solution that makes the all waste problem disappears.
Unfortunately, an incinerator is only a step of a whole.
Actually, incineration should be limited as much as possible, because it always comes with important negative effects.
A comprehensive study on small scale incinerators commissioned by WHO in 2004 proved the following conclusions:
Single chamber incinerators (what I often call pizza hoven) should be banned because their emission level is not acceptable.
They donâ€™t reach incineration conditions.
Double-chamber self combustion incinerators, like this one, should be used only as a transitional solution.
If chosen, the way they are operated is paramount it can tilt the balance between the overall cost benefit analysis.
The same machine is giving very different results.
More advanced technologies such as assisted combustion double chambers incinerators or completely different technology, like small autoclaving should be promoted as soon as the proper conditions of financial and technical sustainability exist.
Problem is that in many cases, these conditions are very very difficult to meet.
They should be evaluated on a case by case basis.
Here a table summarizing the suitability treatment techniques by type of waste
So , now it is clear.
There is no standard solution.
Here another example of how to treat the same waste, SHARP.
In this case, segregation is pushed further within the same sharp category.
We now differentiate between needles, glass and scalpel.
Each of them has its on dedicated container that it is directly disposed with a dedicated device on top the pit
Where the sharp will be permanently disposed.
This provides multiple benefits: it reduce the manipulation of sharps in the waste area, it reduces the accidents due to glass explosions, it reduces the amount of waste to be incinerated.
All very good points, but they need to be counterbalanced by more attention required by the staff, more follow-up.
Always a weak point in all systems.
Once again the most adapted solution depends on the context.
Protecting public health through the management of wastes can be achieved by a variety of methods.
A context specific analysis should guide the selection of an appropriate system.
A way to assess a change in the system is provided by this reverted pyramid : the â€˜waste hierarchyâ€™: illustrating the most desirable method at the top to the least desirable at the base.
Letâ€™s see some examples of applications of these principles.
Prevent:
For Example: many medical Equipments, such as intravenous bags, artery catheters, blood bags, dialysis bags and tubing contain Polyvinyl
Chloride (PVC) plastic.
Incinerated, they produce CHLORINATED DIOXINS which are extremely potent, toxic substances.
Alternative products, PVC free, exist in the market.
Their choice would prevent a mayor problem.
-Another example:
The use of digital X-ray imagery would totally prevent the problem of the disposal of toxic development liquid.
Reduce:
-The strict respect of segregation procedures can dramatically reduce the quantity of waste to be handled as medical waste.
No need to treat kitchen waste as infectious! and finally Reuse. this is a Reusable Sharp Container developed by MSF.
It is safe in protecting medical operators from accidental puncture, and it can even be built with local materials, but more importantly, it prevents to use of whatsoever treatment
(usually incineration) to safely dispose of the needles it contains.
Its contents is dropped in a dedicated pit, and kept out reach in a permanent way.
Use these principles as guidelines when designing a Medical Waste Management system.
Keep in mind that, more often than not, you will need to compromise in order to enforce sustainability or to reduce costs, but always choose the option reducing the overall risk.
In conclusion to recapitulate this video, we briefly saw the actual steps of a waste systems,
We saw how the overall system should be designed according to the local resources available
And more importantly how each step should be properly executed in order to obtain the desired effect.
Finally we review the overall set of principles that should be always at the basis of a sound medical waste management system
