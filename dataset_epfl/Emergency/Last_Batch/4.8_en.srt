1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:10,690
Unfortunately, around the world, huge amounts
of waste water and sludge end up untreated

2
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,520
into rivers, lakes,
and into the sea.

3
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,529
What does it take to treat them?

4
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:22,450
I will now introduce you to the centralized
and semi-centralized treatment technologies.

5
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:26,520
The treatment process can be divided into
several stages.

6
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:34,039
The pre-treatment, the primary treatment,
the secondary treatment, the tertiary treatment,

7
00:00:34,039 --> 00:00:36,260
or post-treatment.

8
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:40,040
Within these categories,
some technologies are based on biological

9
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:45,010
processes:
aerobic, anaerobic or both.

10
00:00:45,010 --> 00:00:48,130
And some others on physical, chemical ones.

11
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:51,600
In this module, we'll have a look
at the different treatment stages

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,250
and then focus on pre- and post-treatment,
which can be implemented in any system.

13
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,750
we will review the anaerobic technologies,
The learning goals

14
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,870
of this series of modules on treatment are:
get to know the different treatment technologies,

15
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:07,030
understand the different treatment stages
and processes,

16
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,280
and understand the different functions
of the treatment technologies.

17
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,590
Let's start.

18
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:16,540
First, let's review
the different treatment stages.

19
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:20,210
The two main treatment stages
are called primary and secondary.

20
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,140
"Primary treatment" consists
in the liquid/solid separation.

21
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,030
For example, through sedimentation.

22
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:30,960
As for the "Secondary treatment", it consists
of the removal

23
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,060
of organic matter and suspended solids.

24
00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:39,110
The "pre-treatment" is the preliminary removal
of waste water or sludge constituents, such

25
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:45,630
as oil,
grease and various solids, like sand and trash.

26
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:47,360
Pre-treatment is a must.

27
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,630
On the other hand,
the "tertiary treatment" and "post-treatment"

28
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,790
consist of removing elements like remaining
pathogens,

29
00:01:54,790 --> 00:02:02,049
nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorous,
or micropollutants from the effluent.

30
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:05,890
Tertiary treatment embraces a large spectrum
of technologies,

31
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,910
and most of them are not implemented in low-
and middle-income countries.

32
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:13,010
Too expensive and too complex.

33
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,230
Let's have a look at a few pre-treatment technologies.

34
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,629
Pre-treatment is a preliminary removal of
waste water

35
00:02:18,629 --> 00:02:24,150
or sludge constituents, either before conveyance,
or before treatment systems.

36
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,749
It is meant to prevent the accumulation of
solids

37
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:29,049
in further stages and avoid blockages.

38
00:02:29,049 --> 00:02:33,519
It can also help produce abrasion
of mechanical parts and extend the life

39
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,980
of sanitation infrastructure.

40
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:41,239
Pre-treatment technologies
use physical removal mechanisms such as screening,

41
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,459
flotation, settling,
and filtration.

42
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:51,419
"Screening" is used, for example, in the screens
to prevent trash

43
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:54,959
and coarse solids to end up in the sewerage
system

44
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:56,329
or the treatment plant.

45
00:02:56,329 --> 00:03:01,139
"Flotation" is used,
for example, in grease traps and grids interceptors

46
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,349
to remove the fats, oil and grease.

47
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:10,400
Finally, "settling" is used, for example,
in the sand trap,

48
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:19,359
or grit chambers, to remove the heavier solids.

49
00:03:19,359 --> 00:03:22,900
As you can see in this figure, grease traps
and grit chambers

50
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:26,939
can be combined in one technology.

51
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:31,230
On the other end of the treatment process,
there are different possibilities to polish

52
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:36,419
the effluent:
the so called post- treatment technologies.

53
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:41,919
Depending on the design and use of the effluent,
or on national standards for discharging water

54
00:03:41,919 --> 00:03:45,159
bodies,
a post-treatment step may be required

55
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:51,109
to remove pathogens, residual suspended solids,
or its soil constituents.

56
00:03:51,109 --> 00:03:53,949
This can be mainly achieved through tertiary
filtration

57
00:03:53,949 --> 00:03:56,219
and disinfection techniques.

58
00:03:56,219 --> 00:04:01,529
Filtration process can be classified
in two categories: first, the depth,

59
00:04:01,529 --> 00:04:05,239
or "packed-bed filtration", as shown in this
figure,

60
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:08,519
where the effluent passes through a filter
medium,

61
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:11,369
such as sand or activated carbon.

62
00:04:11,369 --> 00:04:16,900
On the other hand, “surface filtration“
removes undesired elements through sieving;

63
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:19,090
for example,
through membranes.

64
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:25,180
As for "disinfection", its target is the elimination
of pathogenic micro-organisms.

65
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:27,639
Chlorine is the most widespread technique.

66
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:31,470
Chlorine is mixed with effluent at the outset
of the treatment plant,

67
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,780
as shown in this figure, with a chlorine diffuser
and a chlorine mixer.

68
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:41,580
You can also do disinfection through UV radiation
or ozonation,

69
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,250
the two being more energy intensive.

70
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:47,340
However, you have to be cautious with disinfection.

71
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,770
For example, chlorine together with organic
matter

72
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:53,410
can form toxic byproducts, harmful for the
environment.

73
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:57,300
It should thus only be applied if strictly
necessary.

74
00:04:57,300 --> 00:05:01,250
You don't want to create more problems than
you actually solve.

75
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:06,110
To sum up, we saw that treatment is a succession
of different steps,

76
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,270
the main ones being the primary and secondary
treatment.

77
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:13,409
Pre-treatment is a must, as a kind of preventive
measure,

78
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:16,919
either at the household level, at the street
level,

79
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:20,469
or at the inlet of a treatment plant.

80
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:25,050
Post-treatment is not always necessary,
and a pragmatic approach is recommended.

81
00:05:25,050 --> 00:05:27,509
The effluent quality should match the intended
end use

82
00:05:27,509 --> 00:05:30,830
practice, or the quality of the receiving
water body.
