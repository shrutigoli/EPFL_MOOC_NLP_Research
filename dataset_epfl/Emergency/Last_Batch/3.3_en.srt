1
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:08,719
In this lecture we will look in more detail
at different water intakes.

2
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:16,450
We will get to know most commonly used water
intake structures, will discuss applicability

3
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:22,190
of different intakes under certain conditions
as well as their major advantages and disadvantages.

4
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:28,100
Rain water collection systems include roof
water collection system if possible with first

5
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:34,540
flush mechanism to discharge possibly contaminated
fist roof run-off just at the beginning of

6
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,510
raining event.

7
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:39,300
Usually those are simple gutters connected
to the water storage tanks.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,300
In dry areas rain water may become an important
or even major water source and surface runoff

9
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,480
is collected by constructing a rain water
catchment dam.

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,879
In dry areas rain water may become an important
or even major water source and surface runoff

11
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,090
is collected by constructing a rain water
catchment dam over a natural rain water catchment

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:56,200
area.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:01,649
The dam blocks rainwater run-off and is collected
in an reservoir and stored over loner time.

14
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:06,780
The reservoirs are usually constructed in
a way that they provide sufficient water for

15
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,490
the whole year.

16
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,310
High contamination of water as well as risk
of mosquito breeding are the major disadvantages

17
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,210
of these system.

18
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:21,250
Surface water intakes differ depending on
the characteristics of rivers or lakes.

19
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:26,690
Usually these are simple and robust structures
generally located upstream of industries,

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:31,830
densely populated areas, intensively used
agricultural areas or wastewater discharge

21
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,310
places.

22
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:39,100
Unprotected river intake consists of a submerged
pipe placed on the bottom of the river (figures

23
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,800
a and b).

24
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:47,340
The outlet of the pipe is elevated from the
bottom of the river and protected with a screen

25
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:52,540
and a strainer to avoid sand, gravel or fish
entering the pipes.

26
00:01:52,540 --> 00:02:00,229
Sand entering the pump can damage most pumps
irreversibly within seconds.

27
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:04,399
Protected river intake includes a number of
screens to keep out floating material such

28
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:10,119
as trees and branches . The protected intake
should be elevated to at least 1 m above the

29
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:15,870
riverbed to avoid entering of boulders and
rolling stones.

30
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:21,000
The inlets should be always submerged at least
0.3 m under the surface to avoid formation

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,810
of water vortices leading to suction of air
which could affect the pump.

32
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:27,290
Seasonal changes of water level should e considered
during design and planning.

33
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:31,590
Floating intakes are used to abstract water
near the surface to avoid silt loads which

34
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:38,130
form at the bottom of the water source . A
flexible plastic pipe is connected to a float

35
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:44,420
(‘pontoon’), which can be constructed
by attaching a steel or wooden frame to floats

36
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:48,060
made from empty drums or plastic containers.

37
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,670
Screens should be used to retain coarse material
floating on the surface which might clog pipes

38
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,190
and pumps.

39
00:02:56,190 --> 00:03:02,500
Riverbank intake works by constructing a well
from the river (ca. 50 m riverbank) to tap

40
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,030
the sub-surface flow.

41
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:09,790
Since water is filtered through the river
bank, the microbiological water quality is

42
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,790
improved.

43
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:16,349
The top of the well should be sealed to prevent
contamination of the abstracted water.

44
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:21,170
Spring water collection systems are constructed
to catch and protect quality of the spring

45
00:03:21,170 --> 00:03:22,170
water.

46
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:26,390
For gravity springs, a spring box is usually
installed which collects the water from the

47
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,400
aquifer and channels it to a single discharge
point.

48
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,890
From there spring water can be led to a storage
tank.

49
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:40,490
A spring box provides many benefits since
it protects the water from contamination,

50
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:47,080
stores the water and also acts as settling
basin of particles such as sand and silt.

51
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:52,580
Contamination from the surface is prevented
through a concrete seal on the surface and

52
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,159
through the placement of a drain which diverts
infiltrating surface water away from the spring

53
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,530
box.

54
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:05,090
When groundwater source is located an appropriate
well construction method should be chosen.

55
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,420
Depending on the retype of soil, depth of
groundwater, required capacity and availability

56
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:13,940
of technology and skills, wells can be built
in a variety of ways.

57
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:23,300
These included wells, hand drilled wells,
jetted wells, wells build by percussion, direct

58
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:29,560
or reverse circulation rotary drilling or
down the hole hummer.

59
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:34,780
In this picture here, you can see an example
of drilling truck.

60
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,970
Lets look at the few types of the wells in
more detail.

61
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:41,780
Dug wells are traditional methods to extract
shallow groundwater.

62
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,370
Dug wells are often excavated manually (‘hand-dug
well’) are large enough for persons to go

63
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,639
in and clean it or deepen it.

64
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,810
A protected dug well consist of a well head
and a well shaft which is lined with strong

65
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:59,030
material down to 3-4m below the water table
. The well head is the visible structure at

66
00:04:59,030 --> 00:05:05,090
the surface and is composed of a concrete
seal, a well cover (‘apron’), a safe water

67
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,500
lifting device such as a hand pump and a drainage
channel.

68
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:13,940
Under the well head follows the well shaft
and the intake area where groundwater can

69
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,490
be accessed by the pump.

70
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:21,710
At least the top 5 m of the well shaft should
by lined to stabilize the well and ensure

71
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:29,650
that surface water entering the well has been
filtered during the passage.

72
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:38,160
A borehole is a hole drilled into the ground
reaching groundwater bodies.

73
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:42,230
Groundwater infiltrates the well and is extracted
with manual or motorized pumps.

74
00:05:42,230 --> 00:05:48,120
After drilling a hole, several elements have
to be added before the well can be used.

75
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,820
The well head (‘apron’) and sanitary concrete
seal protect the hole from contaminants entering

76
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,490
the well;
Similarly like for the dug-wells.

77
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:03,320
The well casing stabilizes the well from collapsing
and infiltration from contaminants.

78
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:07,699
Steel and PVC pipes are normally used for
lining the well walls.

79
00:06:07,699 --> 00:06:12,820
The well screen holds back sediments but not
water from entering the well.

80
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:19,490
When using PVC pipes for the lining, these
can be slit to create fine cuts acting as

81
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,139
barrier for sediments.

82
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:27,169
The gravel pack between the screen and the
borehole is required if the soil grains are

83
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:30,509
smaller than the screen slots.

84
00:06:30,509 --> 00:06:35,569
Generally boreholes are less subjected to
contamination compared to dug wells.

85
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:40,560
Some of the drilling methods are faster and
safer compared to dug wells.

86
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:46,660
However, drilling needs expertise and availability
of the technology as well as more professional

87
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,050
and complex maintenance.

88
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,300
In contrary, dug wells have lower costs than
drilled wells for construction and maintenance.

89
00:06:54,300 --> 00:07:00,800
So, to sum up, during this lecture we have
shortly reviewed different water intake structures

90
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,639
and their applicability for different type
of sources.

91
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,789
Surface water intake structures vary depending
if protection of the intake from rolling stones

92
00:07:10,789 --> 00:07:16,660
or debris is needed or not, water level changes
as well as need of water pre-filtration through

93
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,350
water infiltration wells.

94
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:24,120
The rainwater collection system differ depending
if water is collected from roof and used as

95
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,990
a supplementary water source during the rain
season, or if year-lasting water supply is

96
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,460
needed and larger catchment area needs to
be used.

97
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:37,850
Variety of well construction methods exist,
which depend on soil characteristics as well

98
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:42,419
as required depth and capacity and availability
of tools and skills.

99
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:48,410
Dug wells are rather traditional, simple and
well accepted technology, which is lower in

100
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:50,400
costs than drilled wells.

101
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,960
However, construction of the drilled wells
is faster and safer compared to dug wells,

102
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,980
risk of contamination is lower and deeper
groundwater layers can be accessed.
