00:00:04,089 --> 00:00:07,370
Hello and welcome to the third week of the
course!

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:11,650
My name is Maryna Peter, I work for the University
of Applied Sciences Northwestern Switzerland,

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:12,670
Institute of Ecopreneurship.

4
00:00:12,670 --> 00:00:18,760
I am a research scientist and an engineer
working in the field of drinking water supply

5
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:21,500
and treatment in the low-income country context.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:26,900
This week we will focus on the drinking water
supply systems and technologies.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:33,470
Although, the major focus is on the engineering
aspects, we should keep in mind that management,

8
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:38,930
organization, regulatory aspects as well as
user perception and participation are as important

9
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:41,120
as proper planning and engineering.

10
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,660
Let’s have look at the Learning objectives
of the week 3 of the course.Those are:

11
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,491
-To learn the six functional groups of a water
supply system

12
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:54,091
- Understand which technologies belong to
which functional group

13
00:00:54,091 --> 00:00:59,010
- Understand basic principles and functionality
of each technology

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:03,770
Finally in order to be able to define strategy
in an emergency response, we will discuss

15
00:01:03,770 --> 00:01:08,811
immediate and long term actions for the development
or rehabilitation of a water supply system

16
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:10,689
in an emergency context.

17
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:17,520
What is a water supply system? Lets see – there
is a pure spring in the mountains.

18
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,700
We protect it, and deliver water by gravity
to the village nearby, where it can be collected

19
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:27,070
at the standpipe.

20
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:33,419
Or we build an intake on the river down in
the valley, pump water up to the drinking

21
00:01:33,419 --> 00:01:36,889
water treatment plant.

22
00:01:36,889 --> 00:01:41,740
Treated water is pumped further and stored
at the tank, from where it is further distributed

23
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:49,929
to the town through a distribution system.

24
00:01:49,929 --> 00:01:54,709
In the village further down the valley, people
collect water at the protected well with a

25
00:01:54,709 --> 00:01:55,709
hand-pump.

26
00:01:55,709 --> 00:01:57,219
They carry water in jerry cans home.

27
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:02,090
A local NGO has distributed the household
filters to treat water at home in this village

28
00:02:02,090 --> 00:02:06,219
next to the river.

29
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:11,340
Few households also collect rainwater from
their roofs and store it in rainwater tanks.

30
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:16,290
All these different types of water supply
systems have different scale.

31
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,590
However, they have all the same steps:
Water source – spring, well, surface or

32
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:25,730
groundwater,
water intake structure – be it either a

33
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:39,270
protected river intake, spring catchment,
dug well or rainwater gutter

34
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:45,030
abstraction technology – such as hand pump
or motorized pump

35
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:53,189
water treatment – if it is required
water transport – either through a network

36
00:02:53,189 --> 00:02:59,070
or with jerry cans
and water storage (rainwater tanks) or treatment

37
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:01,890
(HWTS) at the user level.

38
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:15,200
Most water supply systems can be structured
along these 6 functional groups.

39
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:23,420
The technologies from each functional group
perform specific tasks of the water supply

40
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:26,749
system and can be linked between each other
to show possible combinations.

41
00:03:26,749 --> 00:03:32,480
It is not always necessary that water passes
through all functional groups to reach the

42
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,480
consumer.

43
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,150
In some systems treatment is excluded due
to high quality of source water, or water

44
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:41,109
is supplied by gravity and no pumping is needed.

45
00:03:41,109 --> 00:03:47,189
However, water always moves from left to right
through the functional groups or from top

46
00:03:47,189 --> 00:03:49,510
down within the group.

47
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:56,349
Here you see an example for a centralized
or a semi-centralized system supplying and

48
00:03:56,349 --> 00:03:58,139
treating surface water.

49
00:03:58,139 --> 00:04:03,959
Surface water is collected at a protected
or unprotected river or lake intake, is delivered

50
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:07,189
with means of gravity or motorized pumping
to the treatment plant.

51
00:04:07,189 --> 00:04:12,989
there it is clarified and disinfected and
either is being sold at a water kiosk or fed

52
00:04:12,989 --> 00:04:15,279
into the distribution network.

53
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:20,720
Safe water storage at home might be needed
to cover for interruptions for a decentralized

54
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:26,620
water supply system including use of high
quality groundwater, the system will be simpler,

55
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:28,000
excluding treatment step.

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,300
In some cases, household water treatment might
be included to reduce health risks due to

57
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:40,560
recontamination of water during transport.

58
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,360
What you have seen on this and past slides
are the system templates.

59
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,710
These kind of system templates can be developed
for different settings.

60
00:04:48,710 --> 00:05:14,780
In general, we define 9 major different system
templates:

61
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,160
This different system templates as well as
information sheets to each technology are

62
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:24,729
summarized in the Compendium of Drinking Water
System and technologies from Source to Consumer.

63
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:30,410
The technologies presented in the compendium
and links between them are not exhaustive.

64
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:34,699
Planners and designers should try to make
the best use of available resources, optimize

65
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:40,759
or rehabilitate existing infrastructure while
taking into account local enabling environment

66
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:46,900
including local capacities and skills, financial
resources, regulations and socio-cultural

67
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,840
preferences and acceptance.

68
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,310
The following steps can be used to pre-select
potential water supply options:

69
00:05:54,310 --> 00:05:57,910
1.Identify water sources which are available
and accessible

70
00:05:57,910 --> 00:06:02,659
2.Identify system templates which include
and address these water sources

71
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:08,160
3.For each template, select a technology from
each functional group out of boxes with multiple

72
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,160
technologies.

73
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:13,990
In the functional group "Treatment", multiple
technologies depending on potential contamination

74
00:06:13,990 --> 00:06:17,120
of water source needed to be selected.

75
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,409
The series (following the arrows) of technologies
make up a system.

76
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:27,440
Compare different systems and iteratively
change individual technologies or use different

77
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:33,379
system templates based on priorities of the
users or community, scale, environment and

78
00:06:33,379 --> 00:06:34,379
resources available.

79
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:35,379
Sometimes, it can be useful to carefully consider
the geography of the area and divide it into

80
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:36,379
sub-areas depending on the availability and
location of water sources, population characteristics

81
00:06:36,379 --> 00:06:37,379
and other environmental conditions.

82
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:38,379
The procedure can be followed for each of
the sub-areas and few systems can be chosen.

83
00:06:38,379 --> 00:06:39,379
Usually part of water sources can already
be used and some infrastructure be available.

84
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,379
It is always recommended to integrate existing
infrastructure or services into the planning

85
00:06:40,379 --> 00:06:41,379
process, but one needs to be flexible enough
to exclude it if user safety or acceptance

86
00:06:41,379 --> 00:06:42,379
is an issue.

87
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:43,379
In an emergency, we can apply the same functional
groups considering that not all technologies

88
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:44,379
would be appropriate.

89
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:48,930
However, use of available resources, infrastructure
and skills gains even more importance.

90
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,470
It can be important to consider immediate
simple basic measures to improve current poor

91
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:59,659
water supply system first before planning
for a more sophisticated long-lasting infrastructure.

92
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:03,830
Protecting the source is one of the possible
measures.

93
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:08,570
Relocating defecation or washing areas as
well as animal access downhill can have a

94
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:11,590
strong immediate impact on water quality as
well.

95
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:17,050
Fencing, rainfall run-off trenches around
springs as well as walls and better access

96
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:23,800
pathways to open wells are another examples
of immediate improvement measures.

97
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,930
After protecting the source, we have to thing
along the water supply chain and try to organize

98
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:34,210
missing on non functional infrastructure such
as pumps and storage tanks.

99
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,650
Controlled distribution as well as making
containers for storing water available belongs

100
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,930
also to the immediate measures.

101
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:46,620
When water is likely to be polluted, chlorination
of water at the storage tanks or tankers,

102
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,270
dosing of water to water collection containers
or disinfecting water directly at the well

103
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:55,319
might be the only feasible way to prevent
disease outbreaks.

104
00:07:55,319 --> 00:08:00,580
When basic measures are in place, further
upgrading of the system can be required.

105
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:03,860
Here, we have to think beyond the water source
only.

106
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:09,099
A properly designed water supply and distribution
system is often the next step and planning

107
00:08:09,099 --> 00:08:14,160
it early enough helps to avoid unnecessary
efforts and expenditures for maintaining temporary

108
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,190
built possibly fragile and unreliable infrastructure.

109
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:22,719
In case we are talking about displaced population,
we should consider the needs and situation

110
00:08:22,719 --> 00:08:27,449
of the local communities and possibly upgrade
the services for them as well.

111
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:33,500
As any water supply system, adequate source
or multiple sources with proper intake structures,

112
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:38,780
adequate storage capacity for uninterrupted
water supply as well as efficient distribution

113
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,131
are the main components of the system.

114
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:43,372
When basic water supply system is in place,
it can make sense to aim for the further improvement

115
00:08:43,372 --> 00:08:44,372
achieving smaller distances and waiting times
at the water points for people, eliminating

116
00:08:44,372 --> 00:08:45,372
direct contact to water source and, thus,
its contamination, lower wastage of water

117
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:46,372
at the source fairer distribution and sufficient
level of services to reduce water related

118
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:47,372
health risks.

119
00:08:47,372 --> 00:08:48,372
And finally, probably, one of the most important
factors - we should safeguard and protect

120
00:08:48,372 --> 00:08:49,372
water sources from a negative impact an increased
population numbers or disrupted sanitation

121
00:08:49,372 --> 00:08:50,372
services can cause.

122
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:51,372
In this lecture, we have looked at different
water supply systems as a combination of technologies

123
00:08:51,372 --> 00:08:52,372
from six functional groups.

124
00:08:52,372 --> 00:08:54,840
Basically any water supply system can be pictured
so, independently on its scale.

125
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,350
However, flexibility is always required: adapt
your system to local needs, geography, availability

126
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:04,350
of skills and resources as well as preferences
and needs.

127
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:06,850
Never one size fits all.

128
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:11,060
Simple and fast measures to improve current
systems before designing and installing more

129
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:15,520
sophisticated water supply should always be
considered on a short term.

130
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:19,910
On a longer term, progressive improvement
of the supply system as well as safeguarding

131
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,560
it against contamination are further crucial
steps.

132
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:28,640
During the next lectures, we will move through
all functional groups,

133
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,300
its more or less detail 
and discuss technologies of each group.

134
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,320
See you soon !
