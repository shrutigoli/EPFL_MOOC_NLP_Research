00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,240
Hello and welcome back .The goal of this module
is to learn about the different functional

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,139
groups, meaning the different steps of a sanitation
system.

3
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,750
You will get familiar with the different tasks
of excreta management over the course of

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,850
a humanitarian response.

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:24,890
This will allow you to know how sanitation
systems can be developed over the course of

6
00:00:24,890 --> 00:00:26,870
an emergency.

7
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:30,730
During the acute phase of an emergency minimal
sanitation services are needed.

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,840
We will have a look at the Sphere minimal
standards for excreta management in order

9
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:41,370
to know the minimal objectives of sanitation
during an emergency.

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,260
There are several different sub-groups of
sanitation during a humanitarian response,

11
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,600
including wastewater management, solid waste
and health care waste management, excreta

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,489
disposal, dead body disposal and hygiene promotion.

13
00:00:55,489 --> 00:01:02,320
The definition of sanitation by WSSCC considers
excreta, wastewater and solid waste management

14
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,820
as part of the sanitation domain.

15
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:05,360
Each of the sub domains of sanitation could
fill its own 5 week course.

16
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,400
In these modules we will focus on wastewater
management and excreta disposal, meaning all

17
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,560
sanitation domains linked to the waste disposal
from the use of toilets.

18
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:14,729
Over time, the goals of sanitation have changed
and do so in a similar manner over the course

19
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:15,729
of a humanitarian response.

20
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:20,299
During an acute humanitarian crisis the protection
of public health is the main goal of sanitation.

21
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:26,400
A public health crisis in the form of a cholera
epidemic or other faeces related diseases

22
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,640
must be avoided.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,800
Conflicts of interest between public and environmental
health can arise.

24
00:01:32,800 --> 00:01:38,299
For example vacuum trucks might dispose untreated
faecal sludge into the environment, due to

25
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:43,280
the lack of treatment facilities, in order
to get it away from settlements and protect

26
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,680
human health.

27
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:50,280
While this practice can be justified during
an acute humanitarian crisis, the protection

28
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:56,420
of environmental health, along with social,
institutional and economic considerations

29
00:01:56,420 --> 00:02:01,880
should not be overlooked and try to be addressed
as soon as possible or even integrated from

30
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,840
the beginning.

31
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,619
Finally the reuse of sanitation products can
become a goal during the post crisis, when

32
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:10,130
new systems are implemented.

33
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,328
Before we start I want to remind you again
that sanitation is never complete without

34
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:13,328
hygiene interventions.

35
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:14,328
Hand washing promotion is a crucial part of
any sanitation project and a toilet without

36
00:02:14,328 --> 00:02:15,328
a hand-washing facility including soap or
alcoholic hand rub is not a complete toilet.

37
00:02:15,328 --> 00:02:16,328
This also became evident during the Ebola
crisis in Liberia, form where this picture

38
00:02:16,328 --> 00:02:17,328
was taken.

39
00:02:17,328 --> 00:02:18,328
However in this module we will focus on the
excreta management part of sanitation.

40
00:02:18,328 --> 00:02:19,328
What are the functional groups of a sanitation
system?

41
00:02:19,328 --> 00:02:20,328
A sanitation system is more than just a toilet.

42
00:02:20,328 --> 00:02:21,328
There are other functions that need to be
covered.

43
00:02:21,328 --> 00:02:24,999
Letâ€™s have a look at the system on this
Slide and how different sanitation products

44
00:02:24,999 --> 00:02:27,159
move through the system.

45
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:31,999
What you see is a dry toilet over a single
VIP.

46
00:02:31,999 --> 00:02:37,609
The excreta, indicated by the black arrow,
is emptied and transported manually to a transfer

47
00:02:37,609 --> 00:02:42,400
station outside the neighborhood or refugee
camp.

48
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,609
From there a truck takes the sludge to a thickening
pond, where the sludge settles to the ground

49
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:50,450
and the clear effluent stay on top.

50
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:55,629
Effluent, now shown with a blue arrow, is
further treated in Waste stabilization ponds,

51
00:02:55,629 --> 00:03:02,129
while the sludge, shown with the brown arrow,
is put onto planted drying beds.

52
00:03:02,129 --> 00:03:05,079
Once the sludge is dried it can be applied
in agriculture.

53
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:09,150
The now treated effluent is added the groundwater.

54
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,459
Now how can we categorize these technologies
and approach the mess on this Slide in a systematic

55
00:03:14,459 --> 00:03:16,749
manner?

56
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:21,559
In the compendium of sanitation systems and
technologies we categorize all sanitation

57
00:03:21,559 --> 00:03:27,209
technologies into 5 different groups with
the color code as seen on the image.

58
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:33,979
A sanitation system always consists of a combination
of technologies from several or all of the

59
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:36,769
5 different categories.

60
00:03:36,769 --> 00:03:41,629
The first functional group is called user
interface, meaning the toilet itself.

61
00:03:41,629 --> 00:03:45,879
So the interface between the user and the
rest of the sanitation system.

62
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:51,339
This can be a dry toilet, a flush toilet or
a urine diverting toilet.

63
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:55,730
Sanitation products have to be collected and
stored on site in some systems.

64
00:03:55,730 --> 00:04:01,059
Therefore the name of the second functional
group.

65
00:04:01,059 --> 00:04:03,189
There some treatment can already occur.

66
00:04:03,189 --> 00:04:08,949
A widely used technology from this category
is the septic tank, in which some physical

67
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:13,969
separation of sludge and effluent occurs and
some anaerobic degradation.

68
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:18,169
Once the collection technology is full, the
sanitation products need to be emptied and

69
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:19,799
transported.

70
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,090
This yellow category is called conveyance.

71
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:27,710
All sanitation products need treatment, thus
all treatment technologies are categorized

72
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:47,210
in the fourth green functional group and finally
they can be safely reused

73
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:51,780
or disposed.

74
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:57,060
During a humanitarian crisis, resources are
limited and sanitation systems break down,

75
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:59,120
are inexistent or have been destroyed.

76
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,729
It is therefore not feasible to implement
a complete sanitation system from the very

77
00:05:03,729 --> 00:05:08,400
beginning that takes into consideration all
functions.

78
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,229
The sphere standards provide guidance on the
minimal standards for excreta management during

79
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,740
a humanitarian response.

80
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:20,590
This can help to set priorities and provide
minimal services.

81
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:24,900
There are two standards for excreta management
in the Sphere guidelines which we will have

82
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,900
a closer look at.

83
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,900
Please go and have a look at the sphere standards
on their homepage on the link provided here,

84
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,900
to find out more about the exact indicators,
key actions and other WASH related standards.

85
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,900
(((As in video quiz: The sphere standards
are currently under revision and an updated

86
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,900
version will be available soon)))

87
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:32,830
The first goal of excreta management is to
create an environment free from human faeces,

88
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:37,129
meaning that all living areas are free from
faecal contamination.

89
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:41,599
The first key action is to implement appropriate
excreta containment measures.

90
00:05:41,599 --> 00:05:47,229
With the lack of resources this can mean a
clean-up campaign, the demarcation of defecation

91
00:05:47,229 --> 00:05:51,680
fields and the construction of public toilet
facilities.

92
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,840
All of these actions have to be implemented
in consultation with the affected community

93
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,580
as they have key information from the ground
and will be the ones to use the facilities.

94
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:07,990
Sanitation facilities have to be constructed
away from water sources and not too close

95
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,650
to the groundwater table.

96
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,130
Locations downstream of rivers or at the bottom
of a slope are preferred.

97
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:20,669
The second minimal standard in sphere is the
safe containment of excreta.

98
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:28,689
The standard says that all affected people
should have adequate, appropriate and acceptable

99
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:34,629
toilets, sufficiently close to their living
spaces to allow rapid, safe and secure access

100
00:06:34,629 --> 00:06:36,689
at all times, day and night.

101
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:41,430
There are 3 key actions to take in the first
step.

102
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,499
Consultation with the affected community on
the planned actions and the provision of adequate

103
00:06:45,499 --> 00:06:48,639
toilets and hand-washing facilities.

104
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,530
A toilet is not just a toilet.

105
00:06:50,530 --> 00:06:55,620
There are several functions that a toilet
has to fulfill in order to qualify as adequate,

106
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,310
appropriate and acceptable.

107
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:02,810
A toilet has to be inclusive to everybody,
including elderly people, people with reduced

108
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:08,520
mobility, pregnant woman, children, staff
and everyone else.

109
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,180
A toilet should be safe to use and provide
privacy.

110
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:17,400
This can be achieved by constructing public
toilets not more than 50 m away from dwelling,

111
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:20,840
by sex segregated and lockable toilets.

112
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:26,990
Furthermore it has to fulfill basic hygienic
functions, such as the possibility for menstrual

113
00:07:26,990 --> 00:07:33,090
hygiene management, at minimum through the
provision of water and a solid waste bin with

114
00:07:33,090 --> 00:07:34,889
a lid.

115
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,879
Also hand-washing facilities and avoiding
that the toilet becomes a breeding nest for

116
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:41,129
flies and mosquitos is needed.

117
00:07:41,129 --> 00:07:47,120
It should be ensured that the toilets can
be emptied when full and that transport, treatment

118
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:51,099
and disposal or reuse of sludge is warranted.

119
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:54,520
Toilets should not be a source of groundwater
contamination.

120
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:58,750
For public toilets there should not be more
than 50 people per toilet in a female to male

121
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,880
ration of 3 to 1.

122
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:07,120
However the goal of any long term intervention
is to provide household toilets, which are

123
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,029
organized by the community themselves.

124
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:15,689
Many prolonged humanitarian responses require
an action plan that goes beyond quick fixes

125
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:17,349
and immediate interventions.

126
00:08:17,349 --> 00:08:22,439
A long term action plan is needed after immediate
actions were implemented.

127
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:27,259
This includes the rehabilitation of existing
infrastructure or the construction of new

128
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:28,539
one.

129
00:08:28,539 --> 00:08:33,900
Implementation can be done step wise with
services that are upgradable.

130
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:38,789
Constant monitoring is required in order to
assure the success of the steps.

131
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:44,089
Especially in the acute phase of an emergency
public and environmental health threats need

132
00:08:44,089 --> 00:08:45,910
constant surveillance.

133
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:51,199
The data for monitoring can be gathered through
community surveys, observations in the field

134
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:53,760
and expert interviews.

135
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,190
As mentioned before sanitation systems have
to fulfill different needs during different

136
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:04,760
phases and types of a humanitarian response,
which can require different technologies than

137
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:07,450
those needed at a different stage.

138
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:11,990
During chronic crises these different phases
cannot be distinguished and several interventions

139
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:15,540
might have to be implemented at the same time.

140
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,620
In the following example the goal is to show
how a sanitation system can be developed over

141
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,940
time.

142
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:26,510
This fictional example of an armed conflict
forces a cityâ€™s inhabitants to flee their

143
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:30,440
houses and resettle in an isolated, rural
area.

144
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:36,510
Water supply is not yet provided and the first
goal is provide a quick fix sanitation solution

145
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:43,740
that serves a large amount of people and that
safely contains excreta from human contact.

146
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:48,000
The proposed first step is to implement public
shallow trench latrines.

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:52,850
Together with hand-washing facilities next
to the latrines, the first standard of Sphere

148
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:54,750
can be fulfilled.

149
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:59,440
These interventions are complemented with
a hygiene awareness campaign in order to educate

150
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,890
people on public health threats.

151
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:04,260
Shallow trench latrines can be implemented
quickly using local materials.

152
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:05,949
Little construction work is needed.

153
00:10:05,949 --> 00:10:08,339
The latrines are constructed far enough from
any drinking water sources, downstream of

154
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:10,160
the dwelling area.

155
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:16,550
The shallow trench latrine is only a feasible
sanitation option for an acute humanitarian

156
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:19,009
crisis and whenever possible other solutions
are preferred.

157
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:22,570
The shallow trench latrine will be explained
in more detail in a later module.

158
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:23,740
The technology should always be completed
with hand-washing facilities, like the one

159
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,740
you see on the picture from Somalia.

160
00:10:24,740 --> 00:10:29,120
The public shallow trench latrines will fill
up quickly and adequate treatment and disposal

161
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,339
is needed.

162
00:10:30,339 --> 00:10:35,540
On-site lime treatment can help to hygienist
the excreta.

163
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:41,540
Afterwards the trenches are filled and covered
and the site must be decommissioned and secured.

164
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:47,180
This will help to prevent human contact with
the contained faeces in the long term.

165
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:52,420
After the acute phase is over and more materials,
skills and capacities enter the newly formed

166
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,940
refugee camp, more appropriate sanitation
solutions can be implemented in parallel to

167
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,860
the shallow trench latrines.

168
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:05,579
A raised latrine can be constructed with a
holding tank below, as more material, like

169
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:11,480
tanks and toilet user interfaces are now entering
the affected area or have been produced or

170
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,100
organized locally.

171
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:20,800
On this image you see raised latrines, with
buckets beneath that can be emptied easily.

172
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,420
In the forefront a simple hand-washing facility
provides the necessary hand hygiene after

173
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,920
defecation.

174
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,279
These public latrines where implemented in
Haiti.

175
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,209
As these holding tanks fill up, a conveyance
method is needed.

176
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:41,570
Vacuum trucks will empty the holding tanks,
dispose the faecal sludge in an adequate distance

177
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:46,540
from the human settlement as no treatment
system is yet in place.

178
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:51,270
This simple service extension further can
guarantee public health in the camp.

179
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,870
As there are still no treatment options available,
the waste is disposed in the form of surface

180
00:11:56,870 --> 00:11:58,860
application without treatment.

181
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:05,360
This is not an ideal situation as it threatens
environmental health.

182
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,320
This leads to the next extension of sanitation
services.

183
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,800
The goal is to provide an improved sanitation
system that covers all steps of the sanitation

184
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,449
service chain, is appropriate to the urban
community living in the camp and that provides

185
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:24,310
toilets on household level instead of public
toilets.

186
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:29,990
Furthermore the system needs to be up scalable
and resilient to future acute humanitarian

187
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:32,040
responses.

188
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,750
Therefore pour-flush toilets are constructed
at a household level, as the urban community

189
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:41,740
is used to water-based sanitation systems
and will not accept dry sanitation systems

190
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:43,980
in the long term.

191
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,759
Septic tanks are constructed in a first step.

192
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:52,600
To treat the sludge from the septic tanks
and the holding tanks, unplanted drying beds

193
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:59,040
are constructed before final disposal in the
form of now safe surface application of sludge.

194
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,340
The effluent from septic tanks is disposed
in the ground without treatment at this point.

195
00:13:05,340 --> 00:13:10,389
As an intermediate step until unplanted drying
beds can be constructed, some short term sludge

196
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:15,670
treatment facilities can be implemented such
as sand drying beds, like the ones on the

197
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:24,610
image implemented by Oxfam during the 2014
emergency response in the Philippines.

198
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:30,160
Finally a simplified sewer can replace transport
of the effluent from the septic tank to treatment

199
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,949
in waste stabilization ponds.

200
00:13:31,949 --> 00:13:38,430
The raised latrines can still be used in public
places such as school, markets health centres

201
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:40,220
etc.

202
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:44,540
Please note, due to time constraints that
we only talked about the technology part of

203
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:46,529
the sanitation system.

204
00:13:46,529 --> 00:13:52,660
However a sanitation system not only consists
of hardware but also software, which also

205
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:55,080
has to be developed.

206
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:00,110
Users need to be informed and involved, staff
needs to be trained, financing of the system

207
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,709
has to be secured, including for operation
and maintenance.

208
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:09,800
All of this takes time and resources and has
to be taken into account.

209
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:14,610
This example shows just one way of how a system
can be developed.

210
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:18,470
This development always has to be based on
many different criteria in order to select

211
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:21,569
the best fit & the most appropriate system.

212
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:27,800
The criteria will be introduced in more detail
in the next module.

213
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:32,399
In this module you have learned why sanitation
service delivery is crucial for maintaining

214
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,319
public health during humanitarian crises.

215
00:14:35,319 --> 00:14:39,790
Youâ€™ve learned about the different functional
groups that are needed for full sanitation

216
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:40,930
service delivery.

217
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:46,339
We then had a look at the Sphere standards
for emergency excreta disposal.

218
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:51,449
Remember that these standards are minimal
standards for an acute humanitarian crisis

219
00:14:51,449 --> 00:14:55,920
and that implementing them will not provide
a complete sanitation system.

220
00:14:55,920 --> 00:15:01,110
You will have to upgrade a sanitation system
over the course of a humanitarian response,

221
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:06,000
as the needs will change and there is no one
size fits all solution to sanitation.

222
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:11,319
We had a look at one fictional example on
how to develop sanitation over time.

223
00:15:11,319 --> 00:15:17,649
I hope you learned a lot, thank you for your
attention and if there are any questions left,

224
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:21,589
please go to the forum where we can discuss
together on the topic.

225
00:15:21,589 --> 00:15:22,269
Thank you very much.
