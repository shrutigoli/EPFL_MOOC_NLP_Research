00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,660
Hello and welcome back to this module on selecting
the most appropriate sanitation technology

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,980
for a given context.

3
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:16,340
In this module, we will learn about different
criteria that need to be considered in order

4
00:00:16,340 --> 00:00:21,500
to select the most appropriate sanitation
technology for a given context.

5
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,220
For this we will have a look at the objectives
and goals of sanitation during a humanitarian

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,809
response and how they can change over time.

7
00:00:30,809 --> 00:00:33,219
There are many different types of Emergencies.

8
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:38,900
They differ in duration, in intensity, in
destruction, in number of displacements, in

9
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:40,670
risk and type.

10
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:44,350
Furthermore a crisis occurs in a specific
context.

11
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:49,629
The compendium of sanitation systems and technologies
counts 57 different established sanitation

12
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:55,499
technologies and 9 systems, not counting the
various emerging technologies and service

13
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:56,710
delivery models.

14
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:03,249
The task of finding the most suitable sanitation
technology for each context is therefore challenging

15
00:01:03,249 --> 00:01:07,160
and requires a lot of experience and expert
knowledge of the context.

16
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:12,960
We will notice how different contexts can
be, when looking at the example of the Nepal

17
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:18,500
earthquake humanitarian response in 2015 and
the humanitarian crisis in the Middle East,

18
00:01:18,500 --> 00:01:21,740
where Syrian refugees are displaced in camps
in Jordan,

19
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:27,369
Over the course of this module we will learn
how to categorize these different contexts

20
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:32,271
and find out the relevant criteria that will
help to determine which sanitation technology

21
00:01:32,271 --> 00:01:34,229
to select.

22
00:01:34,229 --> 00:01:39,430
When looking at a specific context there is
a variety of attributes we need to consider.

23
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:46,060
On one hand we have the physical environment
consisting of the natural and the built environment.

24
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:50,570
On the other hand, we have the enabling environment
consisting of everything we cannot physically

25
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:56,520
touch, like laws, skills, culture etc.

26
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:01,249
A lot of different questions will determine
which sanitation solution is the most appropriate.

27
00:02:01,249 --> 00:02:06,140
Here are some of the questions you will need
to answer during an assessment of the natural

28
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:10,090
and built environment:
What are existing water bodies that can be

29
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:18,400
used as a source of water or as a receiving
water body for treated or untreated wastewater?

30
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,940
What is the demography of the population?

31
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:27,569
How many men/ women, children, disabled, elderly
people are there and what are their needs

32
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:29,880
in terms of sanitation?

33
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:35,240
What materials are available right now, in
a week from now, in a month from now?

34
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,930
What other resources can be used?

35
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,980
Are there matching skills and capacities?

36
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:43,340
Is there water available for hand-washing,
for flushing, for cleaning?

37
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,870
Is there enough space?

38
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:48,000
How much?

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,549
The example of a destroyed neighborhood in
Kathmandu shows how space can be a limiting

40
00:02:52,549 --> 00:02:53,909
factor.

41
00:02:53,909 --> 00:02:59,980
In this case camps were constructed in available
open urban spaces or outside the city, where

42
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,920
more space was available.

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,810
As the danger was over within a few days/weeks,
the sanitation facilities were of temporary

44
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:12,129
nature and the focus was on rehabilitating
the existing urban infrastructure, once the

45
00:03:12,129 --> 00:03:18,120
threat of a public health crisis due to the
lack of sanitation was averted.

46
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,730
Other questions are:
What is the condition of the existing sanitation

47
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:22,940
infrastructure?

48
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,939
Can it be rehabilitated and how fast?

49
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:30,730
What are the soil properties, for example
the infiltration rate of clean water, of greywater

50
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:31,730
and of wastewater?

51
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,069
And how high is the groundwater table?

52
00:03:35,069 --> 00:03:41,459
What is the topography of the area and the
rainfall patterns, as well as temperature?

53
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:48,110
What are the sanitation products, such as
toilet paper, anal cleansing water, menstrual

54
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:53,340
hygiene products, that need to be dealt with?

55
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,239
For the enabling environment the questions
are often more complex and the answers are

56
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,549
not straightforward.

57
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:07,140
Two initial important questions for a sanitation
system are if people are used to sit or squat

58
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:14,060
and what product they use to clean themselves
after defecation.

59
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:20,970
For example in India most people are used
to squat when using the toilet and clean themselves

60
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,560
with water after defecation, while in a European
context people usually have sitting toilets

61
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,380
and clean themselves with toilet paper.

62
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:36,620
This can be found out easily.

63
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:40,970
What happens if the question of toilet style
is ignored was seen in Germany during the

64
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:46,830
refugee crisis in 2016, when refugees from
Syria, used to squatting toilets and water

65
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:52,500
for anal cleansing, were faced with sitting
toilets and toilet paper in German cities.

66
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,720
There were even cases of open defecation due
to the lack of appropriate sanitation facilities.

67
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,889
In this case manufacturers reacted and came
up with a portable hybrid toilet suiting sitters

68
00:05:04,889 --> 00:05:06,630
and squatters.

69
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:12,400
Other questions are more difficult to answer
and often have a political component.

70
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:14,350
Who pays for which service?

71
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,641
Can permanent structures be constructed or
not?

72
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:21,080
Are there technologies that are not allowed
or that are preferred?

73
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,930
Is there a governmental protocol on emergency
sanitation?

74
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:31,919
Gathering all of this information can be challenging,
especially during an emergency when the flow

75
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,169
of information is cut due to the lack of communication
methods, the lack of acting institutions and

76
00:05:38,169 --> 00:05:39,910
general chaos.

77
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:44,250
An assessment should always try to gather
information from different sources in order

78
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,380
to cross check information.

79
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,660
In many countries a lot of data already exists
in the form of institutional knowledge, governmental

80
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,650
documents, information by sanitation service
providers or NGOs on the ground.

81
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:04,460
This literature can often be accessed before
arriving on the ground.

82
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:09,069
Once in the field, general observations of
the natural and built environment are important

83
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:17,470
as well as measurements and testing of soil,
topography and other physical parameters.

84
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:23,180
Mapping of the area can be done with drones,
by hand or maps may already exist.

85
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:29,340
Finally gathering primary data from key informants,
community leaders and the affected population

86
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:34,030
is crucial, as these people have a lot of
knowledge of the area and are the ones that

87
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:39,259
will use the sanitation system in the end
and therefore need to be consulted about sanitation

88
00:06:39,259 --> 00:06:45,110
habits, preferred location of the toilets
etc.

89
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:50,919
Alongside the local context, key criteria
to consider are the type and phase of an emergency.

90
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:56,360
A crisis that requires an acute humanitarian
response, but will be over soon, for example

91
00:06:56,360 --> 00:07:01,960
a natural disaster, will require a different
and maybe only temporary sanitation system

92
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,460
alongside rehabilitation of infrastructure.

93
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:10,580
This compared to a protracted armed crisis
that is expected to last an indefinite time

94
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:11,720
period.

95
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:16,740
The traditional model to look at a crisis
is to categorize it into different phases.

96
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:21,770
A growing number of “chronic crises” are
on the rise an make this traditional approach

97
00:07:21,770 --> 00:07:28,039
often unfeasible, as these phases get mixed
up and acute humanitarian responses are needed

98
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:30,990
several times in sequence.

99
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:36,470
For simplification we will use the terminology
of the traditional phases of a crisis again,

100
00:07:36,470 --> 00:07:41,221
while keeping in mind, that these are not
as clearly separated or even mixed up in a

101
00:07:41,221 --> 00:07:45,300
chronic crisis
It might be that different technologies are

102
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,890
required over the course of a humanitarian
response.

103
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:54,270
With an existing sanitation system, the goal
will be to rehabilitate the existing system,

104
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:58,039
while immediate solutions cover the acute
and recovery phase.

105
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:03,550
With no previous system existing, a completely
new system must be implemented.

106
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:05,120
This can be developed over time.

107
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,750
It has to be noted again, that infrastructure
is only part of a sanitation services.

108
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:16,479
Skills and capacities of staff and institutions
have to be developed and their needs also

109
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,970
vary over the course of a humanitarian response.

110
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:27,070
Furthermore in order to assure the sustainability
of services, funding not only for implementation

111
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:31,449
but also operation and maintenance needs to
be secured.

112
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:36,920
Disaster risk reduction measurements for sanitation
services and building up resilience of systems

113
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:40,520
should be the main task before a crisis happens.

114
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:45,270
During the acute phase, systems are needed
that can be implemented fast with available

115
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:50,630
material and with the skills and capacities
of the staff on the ground.

116
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:56,140
During the recovery phase, existing services
should be extended and upgraded and consideration

117
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:59,460
should be given to financial sustainability.

118
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,890
Post crisis is to assure that the complete
sanitation service chain is covered and that

119
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:10,380
if infrastructure existed it is rehabilitated
or decommissioned.

120
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:14,570
In this module we learned that not only the
built and natural environment will influence

121
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:20,470
the selection of a sanitation system but also
the enabling environment consisting of users,

122
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:25,880
laws and regulations, skills and capacities,
the government, financial arrangements and

123
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:27,380
institutional arrangements.

124
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:33,480
An assessment of the context is therefore
crucial and should be done as soon as possible.

125
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,750
Furthermore the nature of the humanitarian
crisis and the context will influence the

126
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:40,570
technology that is chosen.

127
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,540
Thank you very much for your attention.

128
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,070
Let us know in the forum if there are any
questions left or if you want to share your

129
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:51,210
own experience of selecting sanitation technologies
in the field.

130
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:54,760
We are looking forward to exchange with you
in the forum.

131
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,600
Thank you very much.
