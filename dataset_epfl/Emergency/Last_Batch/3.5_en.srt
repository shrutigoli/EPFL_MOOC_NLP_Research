1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:05,759
Here is your source water.

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,470
How do we make it to look so?

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:12,030
And even if looks so, is it really safe?

4
00:00:12,030 --> 00:00:17,150
During this lecture, we will find out about
different water treatment steps, processes

5
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:22,199
and technologies, understand basic principles
behind most commonly used technologies.

6
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,400
We will also discuss advantages, disadvantages
and limitations of each treatment process.

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:33,410
All water treatment methods can be divided
in five major groups which can function as

8
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:38,390
a single step treatment or should be applied
as part of a large multi-stage treatment.

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:43,100
The five groups of methods are structured
around the type of contaminants removed by

10
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,200
the method.

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:51,480
Those groups are clarification which is removal
of particulate matter, inactivation of microorganisms

12
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:59,710
also called disinfection, desalination, and
reduction of concentrations of geogenic and

13
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:03,580
anthropogenic contaminants to meet water quality
guidelines.

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:10,189
A meaningful combination of technologies is
in most cases necessary to achieve the WHO

15
00:01:10,189 --> 00:01:12,180
water quality standards for safe drinking
water.

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,180
The choice of technologies or its combinations
we make depends on the many factors including

17
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:14,180
available water resources, their quality and
seasonality, legal requirements, scale, space,

18
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:15,180
financial resources, local availability of
products, consumables and skills as well as

19
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:16,180
available energy sources.

20
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:18,860
The purpose of clarification is to remove
as much as possible particulate material.

21
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,509
The conventional treatment systems usually
apply coagulation/flocculation combined with

22
00:01:23,509 --> 00:01:26,179
sedimentation or filtration.

23
00:01:26,179 --> 00:01:30,939
Rapid sand filtration without coagulation
is used as well on large centralized drinking

24
00:01:30,939 --> 00:01:34,530
water treatment plants or community supplies.

25
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,409
In community supplies, roughing filtration
has been used successfully as efficient and

26
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:42,799
low maintenance pre-treatment.

27
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,439
Coagulation is usually a pre-treatment step.

28
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,590
Its goal is to change the fine dispersed particles
into larger agglomerates that can be removed

29
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,239
by sedimentation or filtration or both.

30
00:01:55,239 --> 00:02:00,369
In coagulation process, a metal salt such
as aluminium or iron salts are added to water

31
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:04,670
containing dispersed often negatively charged
particles.

32
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:08,899
Aluminium or iron ions destabilize the particles
by neutralizing their charge.

33
00:02:08,899 --> 00:02:13,170
Water is being mixed rapidly and pH might
need a correction.

34
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:17,540
The destabilized particles form flocks which
grow larger during slow mixing and finally

35
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:24,209
settle down or can be easier filtered out.

36
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:32,689
Another method of reducing particulate matter
content is a rapid sand filtration.

37
00:02:32,689 --> 00:02:38,849
Water passes through the filter media which
is coarse or medium sized sand, which is loaded

38
00:02:38,849 --> 00:02:41,019
over the more coarse gravel layer.

39
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:47,099
During filtration, solids get trapped, settle
or adsorb onto the sand material.

40
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:51,599
After trapped material accumulated in the
filter layers, the filter requires backwashing

41
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,790
â€“ reverse flow of water to remove accumulated
material.

42
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:02,540
The filters are operated at linear velocity
of 1-40 m/h, which is considerably higher

43
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:04,640
than in slow sand filters which we discuss
later.

44
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,640
The filter can be constructed with locally
available resources and does not require consumables,

45
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,640
but proper design, adequate operational parameters
and maintenance are crucial for good performance.

46
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:10,829
For a rather turbid waters, roughing filters
can be used prior to rapid or slow sand filtration

47
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:12,780
or disinfection.

48
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:16,010
Differently sized coarse material is used
in roughing filters.

49
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,920
The size decreases in the direction of flow.

50
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:18,920
Gravel from riverbed, broken stones, rocks
or bricks, plastics, burnt charcoal or coconut

51
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:19,920
fibre can be used as filtration media.

52
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,849
There are different configurations of roughing
filters: up-flow, down-flow or horizontal

53
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:25,439
flow.

54
00:03:25,439 --> 00:03:30,690
In an up-flow filter you see here, water moves
from down to top and the retained solids accumulate

55
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:33,739
predominantly in the bottom of the filter.

56
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:37,510
They can be flushed out by reversing the flow
or simply draining the filter.

57
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:38,510
They are quite simple to maintain, do not
require any chemicals and have low operational

58
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,510
costs.

59
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,510
Filter design, maintenance practices and raw
water quality fluctuations can influence the

60
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:41,510
performance to a large extent.

61
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:44,389
Disinfection of drinking water ensures that
bacteria viruses and protozoa have been inactivated

62
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:49,049
or removed from water so they do not longer
pose health risk.

63
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:53,950
Disinfection is always done after clarification
and not before, as particles reduce the efficiency

64
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:55,750
of many disinfectants.

65
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,370
Disinfection by chlorination is most commonly
used method.

66
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:05,430
Chlorine or sodium hypochlorite can also be
produced on-site by hypochlorite generators

67
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:07,739
by electrolysis of salt.

68
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:14,200
Ozone and UV light inactivate microorganisms
while slow sand filtration and membranes filtration

69
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:18,470
are based on filtration purely or combined
with biological processes.

70
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:24,500
When chlorine is dissolved in water, it forms
equilibrium between the chlorine Cl2, hypochlorous

71
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,070
acid HOCl and hydrochloric acid HCl by this
reaction forming:

72
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,949
When chlorine is added to water, it reacts
first with reduced compounds and is being

73
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:35,289
destructed.

74
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:40,481
At a higher dose, it reacts also with organic
matter and nitrogen species to form chloro-organic

75
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:41,481
and chloramine compounds, which at higher
dose of chlorine are partly destructed.

76
00:04:41,481 --> 00:04:43,840
Breakpoint is the point at which complete
oxidation of all chloramine species occurred.

77
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,840
Figure summarizes the processes occurring
during breakpoint chlorination.

78
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,639
In short, at first chlorine residual increases
proportionally to the amount of chlorine added

79
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:55,919
until the mole ratio of ammonia to chlorine
is about 1.

80
00:04:55,919 --> 00:05:00,690
Beyond that, addition of chlorine reduces
total chlorine residual due to oxidation of

81
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:03,259
some chloramine species.

82
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:06,860
Breakpoint (point C) is the point at which
complete oxidation of all chloramine species

83
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,020
occurred.

84
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:14,120
The location of this point depends on the
presence of organic matter, nitrogen and reduced

85
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,120
inorganic ions.

86
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,120
After the breakpoint is reached, free chlorine
residual proportionally increases with the

87
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,120
chlorine dose.

88
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,960
After the breakpoint is reached, free chlorine
residual proportionally increases with the

89
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,770
chlorine dose.

90
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,111
The part of chlorine which participates in
disinfection and is called chlorine demand.

91
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:28,390
The part which remains in water after chlorine
demand is satisfied is called total chlorine.

92
00:05:28,390 --> 00:05:29,830
The free chlorine is chlorine which is present
in water in form of hypochlorous acid HOCl

93
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,830
or hypochlorite ion OCl-.

94
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,830
Free chlorine inactivates microorganisms or
kills them during a defined period of time,

95
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:32,830
called contact time.

96
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:33,830
Chlorine residual is the chlorine which remains
in water after the disinfection process has

97
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:39,940
been predominantly completed and acts as a
safeguard against additional microbial contamination

98
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:46,449
that could be introduced in the distribution
network or at the point of use.

99
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:52,039
Recommended residual chlorine concentration
is about 0.5 mg/L of free chlorine which should

100
00:05:52,039 --> 00:05:56,210
be applied to water during at least 30 min.

101
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:03,780
Chlorine dose is being expressed in concentration
multiplied by contact time, called Ct value.

102
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:11,270
Ct99 means the concentration and time required
to kill 99 % of target microorganisms.

103
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:16,449
IN case of bacteria, the Ct values are low,
indicating the inactivation of bacteria occurs

104
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:19,550
relatively fast and at low concentration.

105
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:24,319
The time and concentration are considerably
higher to inactivate viruses, and very high

106
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:27,760
for protozoa, indicating that chlorination
is not very efficient for protozoa inactivation.

107
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:32,610
Cryptosporidium oocysts are resistant to chlorine
which often does not provide sufficient level

108
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,530
of inactivation to protect from a disease.

109
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,800
Presence of particulate matter in water leading
to high turbidity of water compromise chlorination

110
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:47,210
and water has to be clarified before it can
be disinfected with chlorine.

111
00:06:47,210 --> 00:06:53,440
There are different forms of chlorine available,
and it can even be produced on site by electrolysis

112
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,270
of salt and water.

113
00:06:55,270 --> 00:07:00,009
The choice of the most appropriate form of
chlorine will depend on such factors as scale

114
00:07:00,009 --> 00:07:05,439
and water volume which needs to be treated,
skills available, safety management practices

115
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:07,639
and power supply reliability.

116
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:14,270
Ozone is highly effective oxidant, not only
disinfecting water but also reducing color,

117
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:16,889
micro pollutants content and other organic
contamination.

118
00:07:16,889 --> 00:07:21,220
It is however expensive and does not provide
residual protection.

119
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:30,139
Due to high costs and relative complexity
it is usually not used in the developmental

120
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,139
or emergency context.

121
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,060
In contrary, UV disinfection is cheap and
relatively simple.

122
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:39,850
It inactivates microorganisms by damaging
their DANN and RNA.

123
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:43,169
In contrary to chlorination it is also efficient
against protozoa.

124
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:46,960
No supply of chemicals is also an advantage
of the method.

125
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,060
However, it does not provide residual protection,
requires reliable power supply and frequent

126
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:56,650
cleaning of the UV lamps which are the source
of UV light.

127
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:01,930
As well as in case of chlorination, it is
sensitive to turbidity and water should be

128
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,639
clarified before UV treatment.

129
00:08:05,639 --> 00:08:13,389
Slow sand filters are operated at slower filtration
rates of 0.1-0.3 m/h compare to rapid sand

130
00:08:13,389 --> 00:08:17,210
filters which are commonly operated at 1-40
m/h.

131
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:21,530
Slow filtration rates allow development of
a biological activity within the filter.

132
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:26,750
Thus the slow sand filtration is a combination
of different biological and physical processes

133
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:33,020
including Mechanical trapping, Adsorption
or attachment, Predation and Natural death

134
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:39,720
leading to reduction of solids but also micro
and macro organisms .Slow sand filters are

135
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:43,890
usually down-flow filters and are operated
by gravity.

136
00:08:43,890 --> 00:08:50,270
Each filter requires ripening period of few
days to few weeks, until removal rates stabilize.

137
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,070
Mainly the top layer of the slow sand filter
contains a diverse microbiological community

138
00:08:55,070 --> 00:09:01,200
and particles which is also called schmutzdecke,
where inactivation of microorganisms occurs.

139
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,820
The technology is simple, low cost and has
a long lifespan, but requires large area and

140
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,500
is sensitive to mal-operation or during the
periods of excessive turbidity or algal matter

141
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,500
in inflow.

142
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,780
During membrane filtration was is driven by
pressure difference between the feed water

143
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:13,670
and filtrate through a filter with pores of
a defined size range.

144
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:18,270
usually polymeric membranes and sometime ceramic
membranes are used.

145
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:24,290
Microfiltration has pores in the size of bacteria
or high and removes them and particulate matter

146
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,340
by siue exclusion.

147
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:33,480
Ultrafiltration membranes are more tight and
remove also viruses which is the size of 20-80

148
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,640
nm.

149
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:40,660
Nanofiltration requires considerable higher
pressure as the pores are small and is capable

150
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:45,260
of retaining macromolecules and larger ions.

151
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:50,500
Small ions such as salt ions can be removed
by reverse osmosis, requiring even higher

152
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,950
pressure.

153
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:58,810
For disinfection purposes, ultrafiltration
membranes are most common as an effective

154
00:09:58,810 --> 00:10:05,100
barrier against pathogenic microorganisms
and particles.

155
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,000
Different configurations of membranes are
available.

156
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:25,950
In drinking water supply hollow fiber membranes
are commonly used.

157
00:10:25,950 --> 00:10:36,230
Spiral wound elements â€“ so flat membrane
is rolled together with a spacer- are more

158
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:38,180
often used in desalination processes.

159
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:44,830
Flat sheet membrane modules are more often
used in wastewater treatment in membrane bioreactors.

160
00:10:44,830 --> 00:10:53,980
Membranes need to be frequently backflushed
to remove a layer of particles or microorganisms

161
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,310
accumulating on the surface of the membrane.

162
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:01,810
This layer is also called fouling layer.

163
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:07,890
The drinking water filtration systems offer
constant and reliable operation, which however

164
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:12,560
requires high degree of automation, reliable
power supply and relatively high costs.

165
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,490
There are also gravity driven systems on the
market and in development, more suitable for

166
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,150
remote applications.

167
00:11:21,150 --> 00:11:25,870
Desalination is used to remove salt from sea
or brackish water.

168
00:11:25,870 --> 00:11:32,640
If a semipermeable membrane is installed between
pure and saline water containers, pure water

169
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:39,060
be drawn by saline water creating osmotic
pressure.

170
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,270
In order to overcome this osmotic pressure,
external pressure which is higher than osmotic

171
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,880
pressure, needs to be applied.

172
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:51,580
Seawater has an osmotic pressure of about
25 bar.

173
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:58,390
Thus RO systems are operated at 30-70 bar
to achieve movement of pure water from saline

174
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,690
water through the membrane.

175
00:12:01,690 --> 00:12:08,060
Thus, high pressure pumps and good power supply
are required, as well as pretreatment to protect

176
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:12,030
membranes from fouling.

177
00:12:12,030 --> 00:12:16,860
Chemical contaminants are either naturally
occurring chemicals in rocks and soils such

178
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,170
as F and As or synthetic chemicals introduced
into environment through industrial waste

179
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,830
and wastewater, agricultural practices or
untreated municipal wastewater.

180
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:33,010
Adsorption on granular activated carbon, sometimes
ozonation as well as nanofiltration or RO

181
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:37,550
are common methods to reduce concentrations
to the acceptable level.

182
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:43,670
It is quite complex and costly processes and
it is advisable to look for other water sources

183
00:12:43,670 --> 00:12:49,420
if this is possible if concentrations of synthetic
chemicals are too high.

184
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:55,230
Fluoride and arsenic are most commonly occurring
geogenic chemicals which pose a health risk.

185
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,100
There are few methods based on adsorption,
coagulation, ion exchange and membranes to

186
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:04,240
reduce concentrations of these chemicals.

187
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,470
All of them have advantages and disadvantages
and no best option exist yet.

188
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:13,730
There is a large variety of different treatment
technologies and part of these we have not

189
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:14,750
considered here.

190
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:21,700
Some processes are still in development or
few promising systems still exist as pilots.

191
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:26,440
Nevertheless in this course we considered
major conventional drinking water treatment

192
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,671
steps which include clarification and disinfection.

193
00:13:29,671 --> 00:13:35,330
Disinfection is not efficient if water is
turbid, and thus clarification needs to be

194
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:37,670
done before.

195
00:13:37,670 --> 00:13:42,110
Geogenic and anthropogenic contamination of
water require special additional treatment

196
00:13:42,110 --> 00:13:48,180
steps, which adds complexity to the system
Desalination of sea water is complex, has

197
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:54,270
high energy demand and often only appropriate
in cases were ultimately no other water source

198
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:57,350
is available.

199
00:13:57,350 --> 00:14:06,810
So, we clarified and disinfected this water.

200
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:09,339
Letâ€™s drink it!
