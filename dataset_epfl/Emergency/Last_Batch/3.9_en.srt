00:00:04,549 --> 00:00:10,179
Hello and welcome to the last presentation
of this week summarizing the key messages.

2
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:14,800
During this week we have focused on the different
water supply systems and technologies.

3
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:20,480
We have learned almost every water supply
system at any scale can be presented as a

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,109
combination of technologies from 6 different
functional groups.

5
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:29,589
We have looked in more detail at every functional
group and discussed different technologies,

6
00:00:29,589 --> 00:00:33,460
mostly applied in conventional water treatment
schemas.

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:38,350
Finally in each relevant functional group
we shortly discussed measures and technologies

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:43,170
rather specific for emergency water supply.

9
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:52,250
The six functional groups include source,
intake, abstraction, treatment, distribution

10
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:56,579
and transport as well as user safety.

11
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,640
By combining the technologies from left to
right, we can create system templates for

12
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:11,250
different water sources, scales and local
conditions, preferences and enabling environment.

13
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:19,560
Major drinking water sources include surface
water, ground water, rain water and sometimes

14
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:24,090
sea water can be used if no other water sources
are available.

15
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:33,651
The major criteria for selecting a water source
include water quantity, water quality, technology

16
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:40,040
required for exploitation and accessibility
and acceptance.

17
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:43,670
Water is collected from the sources through
an intake systems.

18
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:48,970
These can be water storage dams, protected
springs, dug wells or boreholes, as well as

19
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:55,020
protected and unprotected river and lake intakes,
as well as surface water infiltration wells

20
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,300
and galleries.

21
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:03,150
Springs are usually the easiest and comparably
low cost way of accessing groundwater when

22
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:11,810
it is possible as construction costs are comparably
low and no pump is needed.

23
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:17,560
For water abstraction, gravity water supplies
should be used whenever possible, as those

24
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,940
are usually low cost and reliable way of abstracting
water.

25
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:24,640
A large variety of pumps are available on
the market.

26
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:30,750
Required pressure, well depth or needed elevation
as well as available energy sources usually

27
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,330
define which types of pumps are feasible to
use.

28
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:40,860
Clarification combined with disinfection are
the conventional ways of treating water not

29
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,990
contaminated with geogenic chemicals or chemicals
from industry or agriculture.

30
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:53,850
If water is chemically contaminated it becomes
more difficult to manage the problem and reduce

31
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,790
contamination level to acceptable values.

32
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:02,870
Desalination of water is complex and expensive
and requires high energy demand and reliable

33
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:04,510
power sources.

34
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:09,310
If there other water sources, they should
be considered first.

35
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,900
Water distribution and transport can be done
in various ways ad scales such as delivering

36
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:20,350
water with jerry can from a nearby water source,
buying water from water vendors, supplying

37
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:25,040
water with tankers to the areas without access
to water sources or through a distribution

38
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,240
network.

39
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:32,930
Although jerry cans are not optimal and recontamination
of water is likely, it is still very common

40
00:03:32,930 --> 00:03:35,310
in many places.

41
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:40,200
In case water sources are far or time for
collecting water is limited, water vendors

42
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,990
might provide a service of delivering water
at higher cost to the home.

43
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:50,260
Tinkering water is still being done in areas
without alternatives, although it is costly

44
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,990
and can become a logistical nightmare.

45
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:55,660
It should rather be avoided whenever possible.

46
00:03:55,660 --> 00:04:01,239
Obviously distribution network is the most
desired, convenient and safe way of delivering

47
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:03,090
water to consumers.

48
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:08,959
However it is expensive, complex, requires
skills and expertise.

49
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,901
However, rehabilitation of distribution networks
becomes more often the daily business in an

50
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:18,359
emergency as conflicts move more to the urban
areas and are getting protracted.

51
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:25,620
When water sources are far or supply intermittent,
safe water storage at home becomes crucial

52
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:33,229
to avoid health risks due to recontamination
of water.

53
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:34,319
See you and goodbye.
