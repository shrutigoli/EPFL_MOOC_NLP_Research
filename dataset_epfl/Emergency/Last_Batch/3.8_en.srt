1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:08,029
Previously, we covered functional groups from
source to treatment.

2
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:13,660
Today I would like to talk in more detail
about the last two functional groups – distribution

3
00:00:13,660 --> 00:00:17,669
and transport as well as user safety.

4
00:00:17,669 --> 00:00:25,699
We will get familiar with the water transport
and distribution systems in a developmental

5
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:27,640
and emergency context.

6
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:32,430
The user safety aspects will be considered
only in regard to storage.

7
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:39,750
If you are interested to find out more about
HWT, refer to the Eawag`s MOOC on household

8
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,790
water treatment and safe storage.

9
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:48,260
Transport of water in jerry cans is a reality
for many rural and urban families.

10
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:52,989
Depending on the location of the water source,
it requires often a lot of time which can

11
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:55,290
be used for other activities.

12
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:59,960
In areas where water sources are located at
longer distances, other water distribution

13
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,950
options should be considered first.

14
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:08,080
Transport of jerry cans filled with safe water
to home by water kiosk providers can be costly

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,280
but in general adequate option in case water
and jerry cans are disinfected and safely

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,280
sealed.

17
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,189
Usually this is not the case and deterioration
of water quality can be expected during transport

18
00:01:20,189 --> 00:01:22,789
and use.

19
00:01:22,789 --> 00:01:27,030
Chlorination of jerry cans at the point of
water collection can be an option to improve

20
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:30,009
the situation.

21
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:35,600
Water vendors range from individuals who carry
water in containers, pushcarts or bicycles,

22
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,909
or deliver it in jerry cans with charts driven
by animals or trucks.

23
00:01:40,909 --> 00:01:46,200
Reselling of water can be either formal (water
trucks managed by utilities or communities)

24
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,299
or informal, such as individuals, buying water
or fetching it at the source and carrying

25
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,799
it to peoples home and reselling it at a higher
price.

26
00:01:54,799 --> 00:02:00,210
Water vendors often operate as an extension
to public supply in urban areas performing

27
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,509
the service to fill the gap between demand
and supply.

28
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:10,539
In rural areas, high distance to water sources
often is the driving force for water vendors.

29
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:16,870
Higher price then water at the network, water
kiosk or borehole is often the drawback.

30
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,900
On this picture, water kiosk delivers water
to households as a part of services.

31
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:29,630
Water tinkering is still used in remote rural
settings without access to adequate water

32
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:34,520
sources, urban and peri-urban areas without
distribution networks or as an emergency water

33
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,470
supply when other adequate water sources are
not available.

34
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:43,360
In all cases – it is expensive, not easy
to organize and should be avoided whenever

35
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,910
possible.

36
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,850
If water is not chlorinated, water quality
is likely to deteriorate during transport.

37
00:02:49,850 --> 00:02:54,440
And tinkering of water from contaminated water
sources can support spreading of diseases

38
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,640
in large areas within a very short time.

39
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,070
Thus chlorination of tinkered water as well
as shock chlorination of the tankers in times

40
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,260
of disease outbreaks is highly recommended.

41
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:10,310
It helps that known volume and water source
as well as mixing during transport make chlorination

42
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:13,310
of tinkered water rather easy.

43
00:03:13,310 --> 00:03:18,780
Water distribution systems transport water
from the water source or water treatment plant

44
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,900
to the point where it is delivered or used,
such as community standpipe, yard connection

45
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,780
or household connection.

46
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:30,290
It is the most desired and convenient way
of delivering water to consumers.

47
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:35,430
It is also usually a safer way as contamination
is likely to be lower than in case of transporting

48
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:38,400
water by a jerry can or a truck.

49
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:43,070
Water demand in community distribution systems
varies during the day.

50
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:48,440
Water consumption is highest during the hours
it is used for personal hygiene, washing and

51
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,920
cooking and is lowest at night.

52
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,980
These variations need to be addressed by water
storage or pump control mechanisms.

53
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:02,040
In small community water supplies, the option
with the storage reservoir is preferred especially

54
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,980
considering that electric power or diesel
supply is usually unreliable.

55
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,820
Storage reservoirs accumulate water during
nighttime or when energy is available and

56
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:16,400
supply it during peak water demand hours.

57
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:21,500
The pressure of at least 5-10 m of water column
is needed to protect water in the network

58
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:28,750
from ingress of polluted seepage water and
assure sufficient pressure in the taps.

59
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,699
Intermittent supply leads to deterioration
of water quality as well.

60
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:38,410
There are two types of community distribution
networks: branched network consisting of one

61
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:44,009
or few mains which separate in a number of
dead-end connections and looped or "grid"

62
00:04:44,009 --> 00:04:49,039
configuration which consists of one or few
main loops (rings) from which water is conveyed

63
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:52,040
to secondary loops or branches.

64
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:57,250
Branched networks and simple to design and
easier to install than looped networks.

65
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:02,789
Looped networks require number of interconnecting
pipes, valves and special parts, and are more

66
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:06,729
complex and expensive than branched networks.

67
00:05:06,729 --> 00:05:12,539
Looped networks improve the hydraulics of
the system and are generally more reliable:

68
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:16,969
water can be supplied from different directions
which can be important when one of the loops

69
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:22,199
needs to be maintained, pressure variations
are reduced and accumulation of sediments

70
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:28,449
and risk of microbial contamination due to
stagnation of water are reduced.

71
00:05:28,449 --> 00:05:33,479
Large scale distribution is basically a very
complex looped or mixed network.

72
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:38,999
They should be designed, and constructed in
a way that dead-ends are eliminated or designed

73
00:05:38,999 --> 00:05:44,409
in a way that flushing is possible, prevent
cross-connections, prevent unauthorized access,

74
00:05:44,409 --> 00:05:49,599
allow adequate disinfection and ensure that
water system capacity is sufficient to meet

75
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:55,289
domestic demand and other users, connected
to the network such as enterprises, public

76
00:05:55,289 --> 00:05:58,900
organizations, fire protection, etc.

77
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:05,490
The planning, design and construction requires
high level of expertise, especially when multi-source

78
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,710
systems are needed and requires huge investments.

79
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,770
Rehabilitation of a large scale distribution
network is complex but is being done more

80
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:19,860
and more often also in emergencies as conflicts
frequently affect urban areas and are becoming

81
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,949
more often protracted….

82
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:29,259
Nearly 80-85 % of costs of water supply of
a city is used in the distribution network.

83
00:06:29,259 --> 00:06:34,309
Water consumption at households connected
to a centralized water system with multiple

84
00:06:34,309 --> 00:06:41,970
taps and often a flush toilet varies between
100 and 400 Liters per person per day and is considerably

85
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:48,900
higher than households collecting water at
public taps, wells or other decentralized

86
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:52,430
sources without household connection.

87
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,879
This leads also to a considerably higher water
wastage.

88
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:03,180
Supply breakdowns and interruptions are common
problems usually leading to recontamination

89
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:10,270
due to zero or negative pressure and depletion
of chlorine to 0.

90
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:14,889
People with intermittent supply tend to store
water at home in containers, which are not

91
00:07:14,889 --> 00:07:17,930
necessary safe.

92
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:23,979
Water storage tanks are meant to ensure that
sufficient reserve of water is available when

93
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:24,979
needed.

94
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:30,139
Usually storage tanks are installed as a part
of a water supply system to cover for breakdowns

95
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:36,120
in water supply, balance peak demand, ensure
adequate supply of water treatment processes

96
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:39,879
or maintain pressure in the distribution system.

97
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:46,409
Water storage packs - circular tanks built
from corrugated iron sheets in which synthetic

98
00:07:46,409 --> 00:07:52,830
rubber liner is hung as you can see on the
picture or flexible collapsible tanks are

99
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:58,810
often used to store water in emergency settings.

100
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:02,319
Water storage is also used at the user level
– at home.

101
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,110
Larger storage water containers are often
used by households relying on tankers or intermittent

102
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,699
water supply.

103
00:08:09,699 --> 00:08:14,349
Smaller storage containers are placed in or
around households to store water carried from

104
00:08:14,349 --> 00:08:19,129
the source, or collected through small rainwater
harvesting system.

105
00:08:19,129 --> 00:08:23,750
The best water treatment and supply system
can not prevent health risk if water stored

106
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,529
at home becomes contaminated.

107
00:08:26,529 --> 00:08:31,779
Taps to reduce contact of water with hands
as well as lids help to reduce negative effects

108
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:33,740
in small household tanks.

109
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:38,830
Appropriate design and lids, as well as periodic
cleaning or disinfection are required for

110
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:41,729
larger household water storage installations.

111
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:49,589
If water is of bad quality or has been contaminated
during transport, House Water Treatment might be an option.

112
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:55,850
Eawag`s MOOC on House Water Treatment covers this in detail and we do not discuss this further.

113
00:08:55,850 --> 00:09:02,570
So, to sum up, during this lecture we have
discussed different distribution and storage

114
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:03,900
options.

115
00:09:03,900 --> 00:09:07,470
One of the options is transporting water in
jerry cans.

116
00:09:07,470 --> 00:09:12,100
This might not be most preferred option by
it is very common.

117
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:16,759
Re-Contamination of jerry cans during transport
and storage is a large problem, which might

118
00:09:16,759 --> 00:09:19,110
be addressed with chlorination.

119
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:23,970
In areas without distribution networks and
reliable groundwater sources, water tinkering

120
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,250
is used.

121
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:31,050
It should however be considered as only an
intermediate solution or an immediate short

122
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:36,050
term measure in an emergency and avoided whenever
possible.

123
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:39,420
Distribution networks are most convenient
ways of transporting water to consumers.

124
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:46,399
These are complex systems requiring lots of
engineering, management and high investments.

125
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,399
Water consumption and wastage are considerably
higher.

126
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:55,519
However, rehabilitation of the complex distribution
networks is more and more frequently needed

127
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,190
also in an emergency as the conflicts are
getting more urban and protracted.
