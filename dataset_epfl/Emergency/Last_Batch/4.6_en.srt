00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,750
In this lecture, we are going to look at technologies
for on-site blackwater and

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:09,750
Hi and welcome to the third module, on collection
and storage technologies.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:13,530
greywater management, including the septic
tank and the biogas reactor.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,180
These technologies are based on anaerobic
processes, and I will just

5
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,590
explain what that means.

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,080
The word 'anaerobic' describes biological
processes that occur in the

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,930
absence of oxygen.

8
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:30,470
These processes naturally take place in swamps,
marshes, ponds and other

9
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:32,400
standing water bodies.

10
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:36,360
They can easily be recognized
by the formation of gas bubbles, as shown

11
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:38,700
in these beautiful photographs.

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,660
The gas is formed, for example, at the bottom
of a pond, where the anaerobic

13
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,190
bacteria decompose carbon-rich organic substances
into methane and carbon dioxide

14
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:50,630
(also called 'biogas').

15
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:53,790
The gas bubbles then rise to the surface.

16
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:58,260
In cold areas, where the lake surfaces
freeze in wintertime, it can sometimes be

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:01,770
observed that
the bubbles get trapped below the ice surface,

18
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,790
as shown on the two pictures
on the right side.

19
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:11,050
In wastewater engineering, we often talk about
'anaerobic digestion.'

20
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:15,890
The term 'anaerobic digestion' refers to the
degradation and stabilization of

21
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:22,080
organic matter by microorganisms without oxygen,
leading to production of biogas.

22
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,570
Both anaerobic and aerobic processes are used
for wastewater treatment.

23
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,020
The aerobic ones need aeration systems to
provide enough oxygen and are technically

24
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,180
a bit more complex.

25
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:36,490
They are, therefore, not so commonly used
at the collection and storage level.

26
00:01:36,490 --> 00:01:41,140
We will introduce those technologies later
in the collectors about centralized and

27
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,620
semi-centralized treatment.

28
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,450
So much for an introduction to the general
processes.

29
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:49,290
Now we want to look
at a few technologies.

30
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,270
The septic tank is among the most widespread
onsite sanitation technologies.

31
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,860
There are two important things you have to
know about the septic tank.

32
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,510
First - it is a water-tight tank, typically
made of reinforced concrete,

33
00:02:02,510 --> 00:02:07,190
polyethylene or fiberglass and, second - it
has an outlet, through which

34
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,420
the clarified effluent leaves the tank.

35
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:13,969
In practice, people are not always aware
of those two aspects.

36
00:02:13,969 --> 00:02:19,890
They may even call an open-bottom pit a septic
tank, which is actually wrong.

37
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:25,279
Blackwater and greywater enter the tank through
an inlet T.

38
00:02:25,279 --> 00:02:29,900
Settleable solids fall down to the bottom,
where they accumulate as sludge.

39
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:35,950
With time, the sludge undergoes some stabilization
by anaerobic digestion.

40
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:39,639
It has to be removed every 3-5 years.

41
00:02:39,639 --> 00:02:43,529
Floatable substances move up to the surface,
forming a scum layer.

42
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:48,169
The effluent from the clearwater zone, in
the middle, flows out through an outlet T

43
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:53,950
and is then typically infiltrated, for example,
in a leach field.

44
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:57,650
One or two separation walls in the tank can
improve the solid / liquid

45
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:00,959
separation process.

46
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,279
The good thing about septic tanks is that
they are passive and do not require

47
00:03:05,279 --> 00:03:07,779
electrical energy to function.

48
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:10,560
This makes this technology quite robust.

49
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,719
Construction is relatively costly but the
technology has a long service life

50
00:03:14,719 --> 00:03:17,090
and requires little maintenance.

51
00:03:17,090 --> 00:03:22,029
The costs for mechanical emptying, however,
may be considerable.

52
00:03:22,029 --> 00:03:26,909
Little space is required because this technology
is typically built underground.

53
00:03:26,909 --> 00:03:30,010
On the negative side - it has to be mentioned
that the removal of

54
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:34,980
pathogenic organisms, suspended matter, organic
substances and nutrients is

55
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:40,019
relatively low, therefore, the effluent, as
well as the sludge,

56
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:44,180
require further treatment and / or appropriate
discharge.

57
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,620
To ensure optimum performance of the septic
tank, it has to be regularly pumped

58
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,900
as shown in the photo.

59
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:56,829
An anaerobic baffled reactor, or ABR, is like
an improved version of a large

60
00:03:56,829 --> 00:03:58,469
septic tank.

61
00:03:58,469 --> 00:04:02,139
Its functioning is very similar, but it is
equipped with baffles,

62
00:04:02,139 --> 00:04:07,010
which form several anaerobic chambers to remove
and digest organics and improve

63
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,669
the treatment performance.

64
00:04:09,669 --> 00:04:13,160
The treatment can be further improved by providing
1 to 3

65
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:18,140
fixed-bed filter units, which helps to trap
non-settleable suspended particles

66
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:22,160
and provide an increased surface for microbial
growth.

67
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,770
This technology is called "anaerobic filter."

68
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:30,580
An ABR, or an anaerobic filter, can be installed
at the small scale for on-site

69
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:34,470
collection and treatment, but also at semi-centralized
or centralized

70
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,250
treatment level.

71
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:42,340
More detailed explanations of these two technologies
will be provided in module 3.2.

72
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:48,310
In the septic tank, ABR (or anaerobic filter),
the gases produced in the anaerobic processes

73
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:52,370
are just released into the
atmosphere because their quantities are relatively

74
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:53,370
low.

75
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,759
The biogas reactor,
or anaerobic digestor, however, is designed

76
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:02,020
to generate as much biogas
as possible and to capture and collect it,

77
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:07,150
so that it can be used as a renewable
energy source for cooking or other purposes.

78
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:11,759
The blackwater from a toilet can be directly
connected to the digestor.

79
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:17,370
In order to produce significant amounts of
biogas, additional inputs like cow dung or

80
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:22,270
organic solid waste, are normally mixed in
at the inlet.

81
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:26,530
The substrate flows into the reactor, where
it has a retention time of,

82
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,169
typically, 15-to-25 days.

83
00:05:29,169 --> 00:05:33,830
The biogas collects in the dome at the top
of the reactor, and is transported

84
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,990
to the point of use, through a gas pipe.

85
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:42,729
When new substrate is added to the reactor
or when the gas pressure rises, the digestate

86
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:46,960
flows into the expansion chamber
from where it can be removed.

87
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:52,500
In the photos, you can see some examples
of different biogas reactor designs.

88
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,909
Picture on the upper left shows a thick
stone reactor under construction.

89
00:05:56,909 --> 00:06:00,310
This is another thick stone digestor, similar
to

90
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:03,620
the one previously shown on the drawing.

91
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:10,689
As you can see, the space requirement is
quite low, because it can be built underground.

92
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:14,240
On the right side, you can see a floating
dome reactor, where the

93
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:18,810
gas storage can move up and down, depending
on the gas volume inside;

94
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:22,650
and this one here is a biogas stove.

95
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:28,120
This technology has the clear benefit that
no energy is required for operation, but energy

96
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,750
is actually produced.

97
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,840
A high reduction of organic matter and particles
can be achieved.

98
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:39,439
The digestate is almost odorless and still
contains all the nutrients, so it

99
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:44,659
can be used as an excellent fertilizer, however,
the agricultural application

100
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:50,129
has to be done correctly and carefully because
the digestate may still contain

101
00:06:50,129 --> 00:06:51,650
some pathogens.

102
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,060
This technology has many benefits
but its success depends on correct implementation

103
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,219
by experts, proper
operation and regular maintenance.

104
00:07:01,219 --> 00:07:04,840
We have seen that there are several anaerobic
technologies that are robust

105
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:09,580
and easy to operate for on-site treatment
of blackwater and greywater.

106
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:12,599
I want you to remember two things from this
module:

107
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,110
First - septic tanks can be a good solution
but it is important that the

108
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:22,250
effluent is properly disposed of and that
the sludge is regularly removed.

109
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:26,319
The second thing that I want you to remember
is that the biogas reactor

110
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,259
can be an attractive technology, but the economic
benefits do not mean that it is

111
00:07:31,259 --> 00:07:33,860
always automatically successful.

112
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:38,150
Whether or not the initial investment
costs can be recovered will depend on the

113
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:41,759
correct design and implementation
and their motivated operator.
