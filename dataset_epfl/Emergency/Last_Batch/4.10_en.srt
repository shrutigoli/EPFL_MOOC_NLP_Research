1
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:10,500
Now we will look at the aerobic technologies,
which can be used as stand-alone systems

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,200
or to polish the effluent of anaerobic units.

3
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:19,250
Aerobic systems are biological systems which
rely on the action of bacteria

4
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,480
needing oxygen to live, like us.

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:28,050
Thus, in all of them oxygen provision is a
key aspect.

6
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,060
Without sufficient oxygen, the environment
becomes anaerobic,

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,430
which leads to processes such as described
in the last module.

8
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,909
Some aerobic technologies try to imitate nature,
such as the "waste stabilization ponds", or

9
00:00:41,909 --> 00:00:44,320
the "constructed wetlands".

10
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:49,219
Some of these are more engineered,
such as the "trickling filter" or the "activated

11
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:50,219
sludge".

12
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:54,589
Let's start with the waste deposition ponds,
or lagoons.

13
00:00:54,589 --> 00:00:57,659
It is a system that consists in a succession
of ponds

14
00:00:57,659 --> 00:01:00,479
with different functions.

15
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:05,600
First one anaerobic pond, then one or two
facultative ponds,

16
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:09,450
and finally, one or two maturation ponds.

17
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:14,030
Let's look in more detail at the differences
between these three types of ponds.

18
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:18,640
The anaerobic pond is the deepest, with a
depth of two to five meters,

19
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,450
and also the smallest.

20
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:23,610
It is highly loaded because it receives the
rawest water.

21
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,620
The anaerobic pond has a hydraulic retention
time from one to three days,

22
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:35,030
and its main function is sedimentation
and anaerobic stabilization of sludge, thus,

23
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,200
settling.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,610
The facultative pond or facultative ponds
if they are several, are shallower.

25
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,090
Usually, less than 1.5 meters,
but large.

26
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:53,230
The idea here is to maximize the oxygen supply
either through algae, wind, or artificial

27
00:01:53,230 --> 00:01:54,350
aeration.

28
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:58,410
The hydraulic retention time there
is longer: from ten to twenty days.

29
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:04,140
Here, the main function is the aerobic degradation
of suspended and dissolved matter,

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,320
thus, degradation.

31
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:14,480
Finally, the maturation ponds are even shallower,
usually less than one meter, but large.

32
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,980
The hydraulic retention time is about ten
days.

33
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,980
Here the main function is the final sedimentation
of suspended solids,

34
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:27,950
the bacterial mass, and pathogens, thus polishing.

35
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:31,610
Waste stabilization ponds can treat high strength
wastewater

36
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,310
to a high quality effluent.

37
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:40,000
They are generally reliable and good functioning
and inexpensive, compared to either centralized

38
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,000
options.

39
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,170
However, they require a lot of space and may
generate bad odors,

40
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:50,100
especially the anaerobic pond, if poorly designed.

41
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:54,560
It requires expert design and supervision,
especially to avoid short-circuiting,

42
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,770
in which case, the effluent
goes from the inlet to the outlet without

43
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:03,190
mixing properly,
that is, not staying through the intended

44
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,020
retention time.

45
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:11,910
Besides, if they work at best in warm climates,
waste stabilization ponds are not always appropriate

46
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:14,990
for colder climates.

47
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:17,750
This picture shows large waste stabilization
ponds

48
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,180
for the city of Cuenca, in Ecuador.

49
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:24,459
A way to increase the performance of waste
stabilization ponds

50
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:29,390
is to provide artificial aeration,
which is done in Cuenca in the first pond,

51
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,840
upstream of this picture.

52
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:35,110
It is also a good way to upgrade the ponds
when then reach design capacity,

53
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:38,099
especially extension, is not always easy.

54
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:42,200
In aerated ponds, mechanical aerators provide
oxygen

55
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,930
and keep the aerobic organisms suspended
to achieve a high rate of organic degradation.

56
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:52,819
Increased mixing and aeration means that the
ponds can be deeper

57
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:57,319
and tolerate much higher organic loads than
the maturation pond.

58
00:03:57,319 --> 00:04:02,290
The depth may be from two to five meters
and a retention time from three to twenty

59
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:03,290
days.

60
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:06,560
In some cases, it can even replace the anaerobic
pond,

61
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,180
thus avoiding the bad odors that anaerobic
ponds may generate.

62
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:15,150
The downside of it is that aeration implies
a high energy consumption,

63
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:21,350
and thus costs, and requires a constant source
of electricity.

64
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:25,860
Interruption of electricity service may cause
the pond to turn anaerobic,

65
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:30,050
thus changing completely the inner biological
processes.

66
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:35,060
We will now have a look at another family
of treatment technologies: the "constructed

67
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:36,060
wetlands".

68
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,490
"Constructed wetlands" aim to replicate the
naturally occurring processes

69
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:43,199
of a natural wetland, marsh or swamp.

70
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,430
We distinguish three types:
the "free water surface constructed wetland",

71
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:52,020
the "horizontal subsurface flow constructed
wetland",

72
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,160
and the "vertical flow constructed wetland".

73
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,900
Let's start with the "free water surface constructed
wetland".

74
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,740
In that case, the water slowly flows through
the wetland,

75
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:11,130
particles settle, and pathogens are eliminated
through the combined action of sun, settling,

76
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,340
adsorption,
and predation from higher organisms.

77
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:19,430
The organisms and plants utilize the nutrients.

78
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:23,080
This style of constructed wetland
is commonly used as a polishing step

79
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,220
after secondary or tertiary treatment processes.

80
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:30,250
It is only appropriate for low strength wastewater.

81
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:33,590
This is a really important fact.

82
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:40,470
The depth of the water is ten to 45 cm above
ground level.

83
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:45,540
Wastewater needs to be well distributed at
the inlet.

84
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:49,860
Good operation and maintenance is needed
for it not to turn into a mosquito breeding

85
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:53,690
area,
and to avoid short-circuiting.

86
00:05:53,690 --> 00:05:58,490
Let's look now at the "horizontal subsurface
flow constructed wetland".

87
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:03,380
Its performance regarding reduction of BOD,
suspended solids, and pathogens

88
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,040
is higher than in the freewater surface constructed
wetlands,

89
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:12,350
and it does not have the mosquito problem
as the water flows only under the surface,

90
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:13,479
as its name indicates.

91
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:18,139
As in the previous technology,
the good distribution of the influent at the

92
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:21,729
inlet is very important.

93
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:27,310
The gravel bed is between 50 cm and one meter
deep.

94
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:35,050
The water level is maintained at 5 to 15 cm
below the surface.

95
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:39,680
As wastewater flows horizontally through the
basin,

96
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,550
the filter material filters out particles.

97
00:06:43,550 --> 00:06:50,430
It acts both as a filter and as a fixed surface
upon which bacteria can attach, forming large

98
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,800
biofilms.

99
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:57,970
The plant roots play an important role
in maintaining permeability in the filter.

100
00:06:57,970 --> 00:07:01,370
It is very important to have a good primary
treatment

101
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:03,389
before the wetland.

102
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:08,490
Otherwise, the risk of clogging will be very
high.

103
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,180
Expert follow-up is necessary to monitor the
plants,

104
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,990
especially the startup periods.

105
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:20,460
As a final remark, we have to mention
that the wetlands need a lot of space,

106
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,210
generally a surface of about five to ten square
meters per person equivalent.

107
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:29,740
This picture illustrates the last type of
constructed wetland,

108
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:34,430
the "vertical flow constructed wetland",
which is, of course, difficult to differentiate

109
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,430
from outside.

110
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,580
This is the most sophisticated and performance
type of wetland

111
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:44,130
By injecting the wastewater from above the
whole surface,

112
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,949
the distribution is greatly improved.

113
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:52,750
The water flows down and is collected by a
drainage system.

114
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:56,690
The important difference between vertical
and horizontal wetlands

115
00:07:56,690 --> 00:08:02,610
is not simply the direction of the flow path,
but rather, the aerobic conditions.

116
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:07,960
The wastewater is applied intermittently,
four to ten times a day.

117
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:14,069
Thus, the filter goes through stages of being
saturated and unsaturated,

118
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:19,169
and accordingly, different phases of aerobic
and anaerobic conditions.

119
00:08:19,169 --> 00:08:24,449
With this regime, there is less plugging risk
than in horizontal subsurface flow wetland.

120
00:08:24,449 --> 00:08:28,319
Other than that,
the treatment processes are the same as in

121
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,100
the horizontal flow wetland.

122
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,430
Because of the mechanical dosing system,
this technology is most appropriate where

123
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:42,250
trained maintenance staff,
constant power supply, and spare parts are

124
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:43,349
available.

125
00:08:43,349 --> 00:08:48,500
Constructed wetlands can reach a good performance
with processes close to nature.

126
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:51,980
However, one has to be aware of the risk of
clogging

127
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:56,779
and the management of the plants,
especially the startup and maintenance,

128
00:08:56,779 --> 00:09:02,100
and beware high ammonia levels
which may prevent the plants from growing

129
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,100
properly.

130
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,820
In all cases, a good primary treatment is
crucial.

131
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:12,330
Before finishing this module,
we will look at two higher end technologies

132
00:09:12,330 --> 00:09:17,250
which we may call Conventional:
the "trickling filter", and the "activated

133
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,250
sludge".

134
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,790
These systems are really performant in developed
countries,

135
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:26,870
but imply high capital costs,
operation and maintenance by skilled personnel,

136
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:29,430
and a constant source of energy.

137
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:33,520
The "trickling filter" is a fixed bed biological
reactor

138
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,880
that operates mostly under aerobic conditions.

139
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:42,010
After primary treatment, wastewater is continuously
trickled

140
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:49,410
or sprayed through the filter, for example,
through a rotating sprinkler.

141
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:52,830
Organics are degraded by the biofilm covering
the filter material.

142
00:09:52,830 --> 00:09:56,920
The filter is usually from one to 2.5 meter
high,

143
00:09:56,920 --> 00:10:01,370
but some filters may reach a height up to
12 meters.

144
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,040
Adequate airflow is important to ensure sufficient
treatment performance

145
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,910
and prevent odors.

146
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,680
The air can circulate vertically through the
filter.

147
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:15,200
The advantage of a trickling filter over the
technologies presented before

148
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:23,769
is the small land requirement;
however, flies and odors are often problematic.

149
00:10:23,769 --> 00:10:27,930
The "activated sludge system"
is the best known and most widespread in Western

150
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:31,440
countries
under different forms, such as sequencing

151
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:36,140
batch reactor,
oxidation ditches, moving beds, or membrane

152
00:10:36,140 --> 00:10:37,140
bioreactors.

153
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:43,769
It makes use of highly concentrated micro-organisms
to degrade organics and remove nutrients,

154
00:10:43,769 --> 00:10:46,190
leading to a high quality effluent.

155
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:50,620
To maintain aerobic conditions
and to keep the activated sludge suspended,

156
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,190
a continuous and well-timed supply of oxygen
is required.

157
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:59,690
Aeration and mixing can be provided by pumping
air or oxygen into the tank

158
00:10:59,690 --> 00:11:01,779
or by surface aerators.

159
00:11:01,779 --> 00:11:05,470
Agglomerations of sludge particles called
flux

160
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,529
form in the aerated tank and are removed in
a settler

161
00:11:09,529 --> 00:11:14,459
called in that case "secondary clarifier".

162
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:19,200
We are now at the end of this module
on aerobic treatment technologies.

163
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,880
We saw very different technologies
that can all perform well,

164
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,600
but have different requirements.

165
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,459
To sum up, we can say that the main decision
factors are:

166
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:35,610
the availability of space, financial resources,
skills, and electricity.
