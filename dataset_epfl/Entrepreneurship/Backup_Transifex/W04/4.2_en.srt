00:00:08,378 --> 00:00:12,932
Welcome back to segment 4.2
<i>Navigating the funding universe</i>.

2
00:00:14,032 --> 00:00:17,046
Today we are going to talk about
different types of funding,

3
00:00:17,046 --> 00:00:19,441
we are going to talk about
the stages of funding,

4
00:00:19,441 --> 00:00:22,200
the types of financing,
different kinds of investors,

5
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:25,490
and sales or exits of your business.

6
00:00:26,043 --> 00:00:29,920
Let's talk about the stages
of financing for your venture.

7
00:00:30,882 --> 00:00:34,797
We've previously discussed
the timeline of your investment

8
00:00:34,797 --> 00:00:37,493
and how much money you will need,
that was in the last segment.

9
00:00:37,643 --> 00:00:40,905
Now, we are going to look at this graphic,
which is from the last time,

10
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:43,135
and we are going to see

11
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:46,895
when different types of financing
are most appropriate.

12
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:49,092
What we have covered last time,

13
00:00:49,092 --> 00:00:53,955
was the seed financing
versus the expansion financing.

14
00:00:53,955 --> 00:00:56,414
But that can be further subdivided.

15
00:00:57,384 --> 00:01:01,787
So, in this graph, you'll see
more or less seed financing,

16
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:08,914
and seed financing might be divided
into different categories.

17
00:01:09,347 --> 00:01:12,533
And then, there could be different 
rounds of financing over time.

18
00:01:14,183 --> 00:01:18,581
Usually, we consider
the first round of financing

19
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:22,192
where equity is given up,
where partial ownership

20
00:01:22,192 --> 00:01:24,101
- we'll talk about that more
in a few minutes -

21
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:27,433
We called that
the series A financing.

22
00:01:30,418 --> 00:01:32,940
And then, as expansion financing kicks in,

23
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:36,731
we would collect more rounds,
we'll have more rounds of financing,

24
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:40,388
and we would call that
the B round or the C round.

25
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:43,011
So, every time we have more financing

26
00:01:44,561 --> 00:01:47,802
we have additional letter
of the alphabet.

27
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:55,235
Now in some cases, the early stage
seed funding is often called

28
00:01:55,235 --> 00:01:57,352
seed funding
or early stage funding,

29
00:01:57,352 --> 00:02:02,012
but it's also sometimes called
AA, series AA.

30
00:02:04,686 --> 00:02:07,544
Usually, AA refers to the round

31
00:02:07,544 --> 00:02:10,601
where is no equity given
in the company,

32
00:02:10,601 --> 00:02:12,440
so there is no ownership

33
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,831
or control of the company
given out,

34
00:02:13,831 --> 00:02:15,616
but there's some money raised.

35
00:02:16,155 --> 00:02:19,522
Now let's discuss
different types of financing.

36
00:02:19,522 --> 00:02:23,845
We are going to talk about
four different types of financing today.

37
00:02:23,845 --> 00:02:26,185
There are actually many more kinds

38
00:02:26,185 --> 00:02:29,303
but these are the main four
that you'll probably hear about

39
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:31,068
and that you'll probably use.

40
00:02:31,068 --> 00:02:35,613
The first one is a gift or donation

41
00:02:36,343 --> 00:02:40,052
and that means that you are
receiving some money

42
00:02:40,052 --> 00:02:44,267
with no expectation that you are
going to give the money back.

43
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,757
Then we have debt financing,

44
00:02:46,757 --> 00:02:49,882
where there is an expectation
that you're going to give the money back

45
00:02:49,882 --> 00:02:52,870
possibly, with an interest payment;

46
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,310
so you'll give them more back

47
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,581
than what you borrowed from the investors.

48
00:02:56,851 --> 00:02:59,320
And then, we have equity financing,

49
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:02,207
which is basically,
an ownership share of the company.

50
00:03:03,197 --> 00:03:06,807
Finally, we're having convertible debt,

51
00:03:06,807 --> 00:03:10,829
which starts out as a loan and then,

52
00:03:10,829 --> 00:03:14,318
possibly converts to
an equity position in the company.

53
00:03:14,318 --> 00:03:16,475
So let's go through each and each
of these, one at a time,

54
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:19,653
and talk about the pluses
and minuses of these different options.

55
00:03:19,653 --> 00:03:22,585
The first one is gifts or donations.

56
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:27,933
And these are cash,
or in-kind contributions

57
00:03:28,213 --> 00:03:30,918
that someone provides
to the entrepreneur.

58
00:03:31,178 --> 00:03:35,972
They are given with no expectations
with getting anything in return,

59
00:03:35,972 --> 00:03:39,344
so it's really "free money",
if you think about it.

60
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:41,470
Now why would you want
to have a gift or donation?

61
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:45,250
It's clear that there is
no strings attached to this,

62
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,562
there's no consideration.

63
00:03:46,562 --> 00:03:47,739
Consideration is when one party

64
00:03:47,739 --> 00:03:51,804
gives up something
to another party in exchange.

65
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:54,945
So, in this case,
you're really just getting the money.

66
00:03:54,945 --> 00:03:58,978
The disadvantage of this approach

67
00:03:58,978 --> 00:04:02,899
is that it takes time to raise gifts.

68
00:04:03,389 --> 00:04:05,932
We've mentioned before
on one of the prior segments;

69
00:04:06,802 --> 00:04:09,508
raising money is not free.

70
00:04:10,008 --> 00:04:11,676
It takes time.

71
00:04:12,496 --> 00:04:14,710
It costs you something.

72
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,192
And in this case,

73
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:19,821
you are going to raise a lot of gifts
that can often be quite small,

74
00:04:19,821 --> 00:04:22,453
and you might spend up
spending a lot of time

75
00:04:22,453 --> 00:04:24,491
to raise this sort of money

76
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:28,192
because it's hard to attract people
to give you gifts,

77
00:04:28,192 --> 00:04:29,980
unless you know them very, very well.

78
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:32,792
The second type of financing
that we want to talk about today

79
00:04:32,792 --> 00:04:35,160
is debt financing.

80
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,832
Now debt financing is

81
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:43,082
when the entrepreneur promises
to pay back the money with interest.

82
00:04:46,102 --> 00:04:48,574
This is a loan, it's called a loan,

83
00:04:48,574 --> 00:04:50,898
and it occurs
for a certain amount of money.

84
00:04:50,898 --> 00:04:53,155
I am borrowing $10,000.

85
00:04:53,155 --> 00:04:55,124
I need to pay back $10,000.

86
00:04:55,124 --> 00:04:59,514
The loan itself is often called
a <i>note</i> or a <i>bond</i>.

87
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:02,936
Bonds are not usually used
to start up companies,

88
00:05:02,936 --> 00:05:09,165
but a note refers
to the loan instrument itself.

89
00:05:10,654 --> 00:05:13,456
In many cases, with startup companies,

90
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,004
the debt is not collateralized,

91
00:05:15,004 --> 00:05:17,543
in other words, it's an unsecured loan.

92
00:05:17,543 --> 00:05:19,134
They are lending you the money

93
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:23,884
and you don't have any assets to sell off
in case you don't pay them back.

94
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:29,403
Therefore, the borrower
has to pay interest,

95
00:05:29,403 --> 00:05:31,681
and the interest is predecided.

96
00:05:31,681 --> 00:05:34,207
Of course, some lenders,
like your family members

97
00:05:34,207 --> 00:05:37,083
may give you a loan with no interest.

98
00:05:37,873 --> 00:05:39,665
They want to get their principal back.

99
00:05:40,025 --> 00:05:43,341
But most investors will want
to receive interest;

100
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:47,118
It's also called
the <i>coupon rate</i> of the loan.

101
00:05:49,299 --> 00:05:53,080
The loan usually has a fixed time
for repayment,

102
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:55,294
one year, two years, five years,

103
00:05:55,294 --> 00:05:57,547
and that's called the <i>term of the loan</i>.

104
00:05:58,151 --> 00:06:00,376
The one thing that's interesting 
about the loan

105
00:06:00,376 --> 00:06:04,909
is that there is no ownership
or decision-making power inherent

106
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:06,883
in debt financing in general.

107
00:06:07,085 --> 00:06:08,674
As long as you keep paying them back.

108
00:06:09,154 --> 00:06:11,907
If you don't pay your interest payments,

109
00:06:11,907 --> 00:06:14,681
in certain cases, the person
who's made the loan

110
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:17,356
might be able to force you
into bankruptcy.

111
00:06:17,356 --> 00:06:23,500
But in general, they don't control
your strategy, your marketing decisions,

112
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,794
your product development.

113
00:06:24,794 --> 00:06:27,130
They don't have a say
in running your business.

114
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,736
So, what are the advantages of doing

115
00:06:29,736 --> 00:06:31,868
this particular type of financing?

116
00:06:31,868 --> 00:06:33,492
First of all, it's very simple,

117
00:06:34,222 --> 00:06:39,517
and the entrepreneur gets to keep
the ownership and control of the company.

118
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:43,363
The disadvantage
is that you don't gain much

119
00:06:43,363 --> 00:06:45,335
from interacting with the loan officer.

120
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:48,010
You can't ask him for advice
on running your business.

121
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:50,946
They are not experts in running a business.

122
00:06:52,466 --> 00:06:54,403
A huge disadvantage, of course,

123
00:06:54,403 --> 00:06:57,434
is that you need to keep generating cash.

124
00:06:57,434 --> 00:07:01,652
You need to keep paying back the loan
every period, whatever that is,

125
00:07:01,652 --> 00:07:04,267
maybe it's a monthly payment,
or a quarterly payment,

126
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:06,171
but you need to keep paying that loan

127
00:07:06,171 --> 00:07:08,287
and it does eat up some cash.

128
00:07:09,347 --> 00:07:13,223
The third type of financing
is called <i>equity financing</i>.

129
00:07:13,223 --> 00:07:18,180
This is where the entrepreneur gives up
an ownership stake in the company.

130
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:24,428
That means that the entrepreneur
is receiving some cash from the investor,

131
00:07:24,428 --> 00:07:26,480
and in return,

132
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,625
is selling a share of the company.

133
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:36,224
And that means that the company
it is going to have a certain <i>valuation</i>.

134
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:40,806
The definition of valuation is basically,

135
00:07:40,806 --> 00:07:45,360
the total expected value of all
of the future profits of the company

136
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:50,462
brought back to the present dollar terms.

137
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:55,491
For example, you might ask an investor

138
00:07:55,491 --> 00:07:57,461
to give you $100,000 dollars,

139
00:07:57,632 --> 00:08:01,057
and you are willing to give up
25% of your company

140
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:02,895
to receive that $100,000 dollars.

141
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:05,335
That makes your company worth

142
00:08:05,335 --> 00:08:08,636
$400,000 more or less post-money.

143
00:08:08,636 --> 00:08:11,262
We call it post-money because the $100,000

144
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:14,043
is actually included in the $400,000

145
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:17,024
making it for one quarter,

146
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:19,146
in other words, a 25% of the company.

147
00:08:20,342 --> 00:08:24,366
That money put it in that valuation,
which is $400,000,

148
00:08:24,366 --> 00:08:25,805
would be brought forward,

149
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,825
in future rounds,

150
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:30,306
and depending on how things
change on the market

151
00:08:30,306 --> 00:08:32,552
that would be the basis of the valuation,

152
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:34,936
that would be the pre-money valuation

153
00:08:34,936 --> 00:08:36,344
for the next round.

154
00:08:36,344 --> 00:08:37,275
If nothing changes.

155
00:08:37,275 --> 00:08:38,474
Now, of course, you might find out

156
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:41,104
that the market is growing more rapidly
than you thought before

157
00:08:41,104 --> 00:08:45,320
which would make your pre-money valuation
grow in the interum.

158
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,267
All of thee details,
this pre-money evaluation,

159
00:08:49,267 --> 00:08:50,851
how much you are expecting,

160
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:53,501
how much of the company you are giving up,

161
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:56,716
and how much the company
is worth afterwards

162
00:08:56,716 --> 00:09:00,022
are specified in what is called
a <i>term sheet</i>.

163
00:09:00,022 --> 00:09:02,607
This basically gives
the terms and conditions

164
00:09:02,607 --> 00:09:04,424
for the investment itself.

165
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:08,266
Why would you want
to go through all of this

166
00:09:08,266 --> 00:09:11,510
to gain some investment in your company?

167
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:15,360
The first issue is
that you can have a network

168
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,600
and you can have advice
from the people who make the investment.

169
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,003
People often call this <i>smart money</i>,

170
00:09:22,003 --> 00:09:25,068
because that means the money
is coming in, plus you can get

171
00:09:25,068 --> 00:09:28,279
the advice or the network
from the investors.

172
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,442
And another good reason for doing this

173
00:09:30,442 --> 00:09:34,168
is that this reduces the cash drain
on the company,

174
00:09:34,168 --> 00:09:35,988
since you don't need to pay the interest

175
00:09:35,988 --> 00:09:37,576
like you would in a loan,

176
00:09:37,576 --> 00:09:41,310
you can then be more flexible
with your business operations.

177
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,242
Of course, the biggest disadvantage

178
00:09:44,242 --> 00:09:48,614
is the one I think maybe entrepreneurs
think about this a little too much,

179
00:09:48,614 --> 00:09:50,698
is that they have to share

180
00:09:50,698 --> 00:09:54,128
the ownership and control
of the company with the investor.

181
00:09:54,128 --> 00:09:57,716
That means that the entrepreneur
is no longer the sole owner,

182
00:09:57,716 --> 00:10:00,910
or the entrepreneur or the founders
and no longer the sole owners in the company

183
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:02,859
but rather they are now sharing ownership

184
00:10:02,859 --> 00:10:05,076
in whatever percentage they agree upon

185
00:10:05,076 --> 00:10:06,934
with the investors.

186
00:10:06,934 --> 00:10:08,622
And some entrepreneurs are very nervous

187
00:10:08,622 --> 00:10:10,811
about giving up ownership and control.

188
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,315
There might be some legal reasons too,

189
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:15,320
legal protections
for the minority shareholders

190
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,604
in this particular case

191
00:10:16,604 --> 00:10:20,753
which might also constrain
the ability of the entrepreneur

192
00:10:20,753 --> 00:10:24,202
to do whatever he or she wants to do.

193
00:10:25,203 --> 00:10:27,510
The last type of financing
that we want to talk about today

194
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:31,405
is called <i>convertible debt</i>
or <i>convertible note</i>.

195
00:10:31,405 --> 00:10:33,761
Now, that is debt

196
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:37,712
that can be converted
into equity later on.

197
00:10:37,712 --> 00:10:39,677
So, in the beginning stages

198
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:43,728
the investment is treated
as any other loan

199
00:10:44,158 --> 00:10:47,530
and the investor receives
interest payments.

200
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,526
However, at a certain point,

201
00:10:50,526 --> 00:10:54,395
which can be agreed upon
in the term sheet,

202
00:10:54,395 --> 00:10:56,509
the investor has the right

203
00:10:56,509 --> 00:10:59,330
to take the value of the debt

204
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:02,243
and convert it into equity.

205
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:03,690
Now when can they do this?

206
00:11:03,690 --> 00:11:05,580
This can be set up in the term sheet

207
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,412
to be milestone-based

208
00:11:07,412 --> 00:11:09,453
or could be time-based.

209
00:11:09,453 --> 00:11:13,485
Of course, there needs to be
an equity round for this to happen,

210
00:11:13,485 --> 00:11:16,602
so that there is a valuation
of the company.

211
00:11:16,602 --> 00:11:19,055
But it could be when the first equity 
round is closing,

212
00:11:19,055 --> 00:11:20,872
it could be in the second one,

213
00:11:20,872 --> 00:11:22,202
it cold be other milestones

214
00:11:22,202 --> 00:11:24,943
when you've received
a certain amount of sales,

215
00:11:24,943 --> 00:11:28,163
when you've received a profitability,
reached profitability,

216
00:11:28,883 --> 00:11:30,722
or could be a time-based thing,

217
00:11:30,722 --> 00:11:32,800
like after one year or three years,

218
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,920
if there is an equity round

219
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,837
that creates a valuation of the company

220
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:43,470
then we can convert the amount
that was invested in debt

221
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:47,632
and convert it into a partial ownership
of the company.

222
00:11:48,252 --> 00:11:49,872
What's the conversion rate?

223
00:11:49,872 --> 00:11:51,952
It's a little bit trickier to explain,

224
00:11:52,507 --> 00:11:58,583
but basically, to entice the investor
to make this investment,

225
00:12:00,033 --> 00:12:05,915
you need to offer some sort
of cap, a valuation cap,

226
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:09,778
on the valuation
of the company in the future.

227
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:14,634
For example, if I were
to lend you $100,000,

228
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:18,040
you might say to me, "Well, in the future

229
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:22,070
if the company is worth
more than $1 million..."

230
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:25,428
We will pretend
for this particular exercise

231
00:12:27,018 --> 00:12:29,236
that it's worth exactly $1 million,

232
00:12:29,236 --> 00:12:31,997
so you will end up
with 10% of the company.

233
00:12:32,111 --> 00:12:35,323
If it's worth $10 million,
you still get 10% of the company

234
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:37,800
because your valuation is capped.

235
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:40,189
Otherwise, the investor might think,

236
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:42,860
"Well, I could put in $100,000 now,

237
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,578
but if this company really takes off

238
00:12:44,578 --> 00:12:46,601
- which is what everyone wants -

239
00:12:46,601 --> 00:12:50,683
then I am going to be left
with only 1% of this company,

240
00:12:50,683 --> 00:12:53,203
even if I took a big, big risk
lending them this money

241
00:12:53,203 --> 00:12:54,703
in the early stages."

242
00:12:54,703 --> 00:12:57,461
That's why these valuation caps

243
00:12:57,461 --> 00:13:00,160
are set up as a bonus,

244
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,851
or as an enticement to the investors.

245
00:13:03,183 --> 00:13:06,076
So, why would you want
to do this kind of financing?

246
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:08,609
It's becoming more and more common,

247
00:13:08,609 --> 00:13:12,356
there is definitely a trend
toward convertible debt.

248
00:13:13,806 --> 00:13:17,433
It can be quicker to negotiate
than an equity investment.

249
00:13:17,623 --> 00:13:22,109
And it definitely delays
the valuation discussion.

250
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:25,138
Some entrepreneurs don't want
to decide too early

251
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:26,369
on the valuation of the company.

252
00:13:26,369 --> 00:13:28,402
So, rather than go straight
to an equity round,

253
00:13:28,402 --> 00:13:30,008
they might do a convertible debt

254
00:13:30,008 --> 00:13:35,320
and they would then postpone
the first valuation of the company.

255
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:39,538
Disadvantages, as you can see
just from this short discussion

256
00:13:40,028 --> 00:13:43,831
there is some pricing risks on both sides.

257
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:45,992
This is something that you need

258
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,787
to have someone else
with expertize look at.

259
00:13:49,217 --> 00:13:51,111
The caps can be complicated,

260
00:13:51,111 --> 00:13:54,975
and if there is no equity around,

261
00:13:54,975 --> 00:13:58,652
you're still paying that coupon,
you are still paying the loan off,

262
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:03,082
so you'd still owe money
plus the principal,

263
00:14:03,082 --> 00:14:05,584
you still owe the principal
to the original investor

264
00:14:06,034 --> 00:14:09,016
even if you never make
an equity round.

265
00:14:09,453 --> 00:14:12,232
Now let's talk about the investors.

266
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:14,360
Who are these investors

267
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,171
that are going to be throwing money
at your business?

268
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,567
There is a wide range
of investors starting from

269
00:14:23,567 --> 00:14:25,914
- as you can see here
on the list I have created -

270
00:14:25,914 --> 00:14:27,195
from friends and family,

271
00:14:27,195 --> 00:14:29,327
all the way down to strategic partners.

272
00:14:29,687 --> 00:14:33,836
So, what I wanted to do here
is simply walk through each one of these,

273
00:14:33,836 --> 00:14:37,529
and talk about them briefly.

274
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:40,109
What we'll do is,
in the next few segments,

275
00:14:40,109 --> 00:14:42,649
we'll go through some
of the more important ones here

276
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:44,553
and give a lot more details about it.

277
00:14:44,553 --> 00:14:47,118
But for now, I just wanted to give you

278
00:14:47,118 --> 00:14:49,453
the definitions of these different sources

279
00:14:49,453 --> 00:14:51,791
so that you are fully aware of the sources.

280
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:56,179
Let's start with friends and family.
That's pretty obvious.

281
00:14:56,179 --> 00:14:58,517
You are going to be asking your friends

282
00:14:58,517 --> 00:15:02,113
and your family to be investors
in your business.

283
00:15:02,113 --> 00:15:08,135
They can give you gifts,
they can be part-owners in your business,

284
00:15:08,845 --> 00:15:11,214
that makes things complicated later on

285
00:15:11,214 --> 00:15:12,501
but it is possible,

286
00:15:12,501 --> 00:15:14,306
or they may lend you money.

287
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:19,725
Crowdfunding is something
that's relatively recent,

288
00:15:20,305 --> 00:15:24,804
but something that is
fairly interesting for startup companies

289
00:15:24,804 --> 00:15:28,896
because you can make a pitch
to a very wide audience

290
00:15:28,896 --> 00:15:32,563
on an IT platform,
an information & technology platform,

291
00:15:32,563 --> 00:15:34,448
an Internet site.

292
00:15:34,448 --> 00:15:38,199
You can pitch people who would either

293
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:42,844
pre-buy your product
before it's even done

294
00:15:43,374 --> 00:15:45,457
or in beta testing,

295
00:15:45,457 --> 00:15:49,061
or they may actually,
depending on the platform,

296
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:52,019
make an equity investment
in your company.

297
00:15:53,349 --> 00:15:58,228
Banks, as we know,
can lend money to companies.

298
00:15:59,368 --> 00:16:03,882
Foundations are often set up
to fund certain causes,

299
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:08,393
and they can be a very, very interesting
source of donations

300
00:16:08,393 --> 00:16:11,139
early-on in the startup's life.

301
00:16:12,260 --> 00:16:15,618
Start-up competitions,
business plan contests, etc.,

302
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:17,182
usually, they are competitive,

303
00:16:17,182 --> 00:16:19,776
you generally get some advice
from the audience

304
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:21,856
who are your panel of judges or jury

305
00:16:21,856 --> 00:16:24,728
and you can win prize money

306
00:16:24,728 --> 00:16:27,801
which could help fund
the initial stages of a company.

307
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:33,006
An angel investor is a wealthy person

308
00:16:33,006 --> 00:16:36,605
who's often made money
as an entrepreneur in the past

309
00:16:36,605 --> 00:16:40,814
and would like to fund
early stage businesses.

310
00:16:40,814 --> 00:16:42,868
Often, angels join together in big groups

311
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:46,263
so that they can have a bigger impact
on the company,

312
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:48,763
in which case,
the angel group meets regularly

313
00:16:48,763 --> 00:16:52,221
and entrepreneurs make pitches
in front of the angel groups

314
00:16:52,221 --> 00:16:55,908
and the angel groups vote and decide
weather they want to go in

315
00:16:55,908 --> 00:16:58,855
and make a bigger investment
in the company.

316
00:16:58,855 --> 00:17:01,921
They would be getting equity
in this particular case.

317
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:07,824
A family office is something
that is set up by a family,

318
00:17:07,824 --> 00:17:08,985
a family business,

319
00:17:08,985 --> 00:17:10,792
and it would be an investment vehicle

320
00:17:10,792 --> 00:17:13,838
like an institutional investor
for that family.

321
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:19,363
A venture capitalist
is a specific kind of investor

322
00:17:19,363 --> 00:17:22,219
that make investments in startup companies

323
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:26,935
usually, at later stages,
and for more money

324
00:17:26,935 --> 00:17:28,389
- we'll talk about that next -

325
00:17:28,389 --> 00:17:31,849
and they are definitely interested
in an equity position in the company,

326
00:17:31,849 --> 00:17:34,967
and they would like to see
an exit event happening,

327
00:17:34,967 --> 00:17:39,001
because they raise money
from other people

328
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:41,151
who are trying to look for investments,

329
00:17:41,151 --> 00:17:44,530
then they take that money
and they invest it in start up companies

330
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:47,285
and then when the company exits,

331
00:17:47,285 --> 00:17:48,956
or has an exit event,

332
00:17:48,956 --> 00:17:51,952
then the venture capitalist
take the money

333
00:17:51,952 --> 00:17:54,307
and pay back the original investors.

334
00:17:55,068 --> 00:17:58,338
And finally, a strategic partner
is usually a a large company

335
00:17:58,338 --> 00:18:02,043
that could be a potential customer
or complementor,

336
00:18:02,894 --> 00:18:04,752
and that's a company
that might be interested

337
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:07,882
in acquiring a startup company.

338
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,589
Finally, put on there just for reference,

339
00:18:11,589 --> 00:18:13,761
we say "nobody",
because there is no investor,

340
00:18:13,761 --> 00:18:15,697
that's the bootstrapping mode,

341
00:18:15,697 --> 00:18:18,459
that means that you, as the entrepreneur,

342
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:22,588
are making money
from the operations of your business

343
00:18:22,588 --> 00:18:24,588
and you are using that investment

344
00:18:24,588 --> 00:18:27,242
to continue to run your business.

345
00:18:27,242 --> 00:18:30,248
So you pull yourself up
by your bootstraps,

346
00:18:30,248 --> 00:18:32,232
we call that <i> bootstrapping</i>.

347
00:18:32,232 --> 00:18:36,220
Great so now that we've discussed
the different kinds of investors,

348
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:40,553
what we want to do is to give
a brief overview on what to expect

349
00:18:40,553 --> 00:18:43,084
in terms of the amounts
of money you might raise

350
00:18:43,084 --> 00:18:45,116
from each type of these investors.

351
00:18:45,116 --> 00:18:46,679
That's what we are going to do now

352
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:49,772
and then come back and do all the details
in the next two segments,

353
00:18:49,772 --> 00:18:51,908
when we'll talk about seed financing next

354
00:18:51,908 --> 00:18:54,691
and the segment after that, we'll talk
about expansion financing.

355
00:18:54,841 --> 00:18:57,633
So, for this case, what we are going to do
Is look at this slide,

356
00:18:57,633 --> 00:18:59,532
and we are going to just do a quick graph

357
00:18:59,532 --> 00:19:02,697
of the kinds of investors

358
00:19:02,697 --> 00:19:04,832
and how much money, roughly the range

359
00:19:04,832 --> 00:19:07,560
that you'd expect to raise
from each of these types.

360
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,931
So, on this slide,
what you see, is on the left,

361
00:19:09,931 --> 00:19:13,237
we have a list of all
the various types of investors

362
00:19:13,237 --> 00:19:15,328
and at the bottom, we have an access

363
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:19,888
which refers to how much money
you'd expect to receive, roughly,

364
00:19:19,888 --> 00:19:22,048
from each of these types of investors.

365
00:19:23,013 --> 00:19:25,804
Just to give some idea of the scale,

366
00:19:26,852 --> 00:19:30,204
what I have done is I calibrated
this scale on a log scale,

367
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:34,616
and so, we are going to go
from $1,000 to $25 million,

368
00:19:35,164 --> 00:19:37,344
and those are in dollars.

369
00:19:38,629 --> 00:19:42,335
You need to calibrate that
to your own economy,

370
00:19:42,905 --> 00:19:44,825
to how much money you can raise;

371
00:19:44,825 --> 00:19:46,244
I'll give you some ideas
on some of the equivalents here.

372
00:19:46,244 --> 00:19:50,590
Let's start with the left side
which is going to be $1,000.

373
00:19:56,024 --> 00:19:57,786
And then, over here,

374
00:19:59,850 --> 00:20:01,721
we can draw here

375
00:20:02,951 --> 00:20:05,284
and then, we'll draw $10 million here.

376
00:20:06,819 --> 00:20:09,524
So between $10 million is about $100K.

377
00:20:11,181 --> 00:20:15,440
Just approximately,
two times the GDP per capita.

378
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,372
Just to calibrate a little bit.

379
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:20,170
Let's put here $1 million.

380
00:20:24,170 --> 00:20:25,491
$1 million.

381
00:20:25,879 --> 00:20:27,426
Roughly here

382
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:31,322
that's going to be $10,000.

383
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:35,059
And then, up here, I would say

384
00:20:35,059 --> 00:20:37,925
just roughly, let's put just one more in.

385
00:20:39,627 --> 00:20:41,279
So, along this axis here then,

386
00:20:41,279 --> 00:20:45,757
we see the amount of money
that one might expect to raise.

387
00:20:45,979 --> 00:20:47,334
And now, we are going to go through

388
00:20:47,334 --> 00:20:52,900
and we are going to draw a line showing
a rough range and the typical amount

389
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:55,276
that one might expect
from each of these sources.

390
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:58,220
The overall trend of this list
is as you move down the list,

391
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:00,980
the amount that you can expect
to raise would go up

392
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:03,847
and therefore, they would be used
at some later stages,

393
00:21:03,847 --> 00:21:06,021
the higher amounts at the later stages,

394
00:21:06,021 --> 00:21:10,315
and the earlier amounts
at the earlier stages,

395
00:21:10,315 --> 00:21:11,617
just as we've already discussed.

396
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:13,752
The first one on the list
is friends and family.

397
00:21:13,752 --> 00:21:16,735
That's where you ask your friends, family,

398
00:21:16,735 --> 00:21:18,695
and other people that you love,

399
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:20,319
to give you money

400
00:21:20,378 --> 00:21:23,871
and/or to give you a very cheap loan.

401
00:21:24,938 --> 00:21:28,527
This is relatively small amount
of money that can be raised.

402
00:21:31,004 --> 00:21:35,787
And a typical amount that might be raised
on the order of $25,000 dollars.

403
00:21:36,747 --> 00:21:40,484
Crowdfunding is where you use
an internet-oriented platform

404
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:43,157
to reach a large number
of anonymous people,

405
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:47,528
and they are what's even less
than friends and family,

406
00:21:49,738 --> 00:21:53,425
on the order of $7,000
will be a typical amount.

407
00:21:54,761 --> 00:21:57,917
So for banks, you are taking
a loan from the bank

408
00:21:58,698 --> 00:22:02,457
typical amount lent is $25,000 or so,

409
00:22:02,736 --> 00:22:05,586
and the range might be anywhere

410
00:22:05,586 --> 00:22:08,476
from the lowest amount, $1,000

411
00:22:08,476 --> 00:22:10,268
to even up to $500,000.

412
00:22:12,755 --> 00:22:14,488
For foundations and public organizations,

413
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:17,256
what you are doing is
you are typically asking for grants

414
00:22:17,256 --> 00:22:22,622
and these tend to be
roughly and relatively small amounts

415
00:22:22,622 --> 00:22:25,224
anywhere from let's say
$5,000 to $200,000,

416
00:22:25,224 --> 00:22:29,118
and the typical amount would be
on the order of $10,000.

417
00:22:30,979 --> 00:22:34,619
Startup competitions: this is a contest
where you pitch your idea,

418
00:22:34,619 --> 00:22:36,443
and you can win prizes.

419
00:22:36,443 --> 00:22:40,685
Prizes are usually on the order
of $10,000 dollars

420
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:45,186
and they can range anywhere
from $1,000 up to $50,000,

421
00:22:45,186 --> 00:22:47,196
somewhere in that neighborhood.

422
00:22:47,766 --> 00:22:50,675
For angels and angel groups
there is actually a distinction.

423
00:22:50,675 --> 00:22:54,596
We are going to draw a distinction
here between an individual angel

424
00:22:54,596 --> 00:22:56,664
and a group of angels working together.

425
00:22:57,504 --> 00:23:01,160
The earlier stage financing
is going to be to raise money

426
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:04,351
form an individual person

427
00:23:04,939 --> 00:23:09,439
and that might be an the order
of $50,000 to $500,000

428
00:23:09,439 --> 00:23:12,932
with the typical amount
maybe on the order of $200,000 or so.

429
00:23:13,731 --> 00:23:15,840
For an angel group, that would be

430
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:20,106
a group of angel investors
who invest together.

431
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,795
Therefore, the amounts
would be higher, typically,

432
00:23:25,265 --> 00:23:29,686
somewhere between $250,000
and $1.5 million.

433
00:23:29,967 --> 00:23:33,967
Typical amount might be
$1 million or so.

434
00:23:34,545 --> 00:23:37,904
Family offices are a little bit different

435
00:23:37,904 --> 00:23:42,664
in that generally, they are doing
the investments for a single family.

436
00:23:43,114 --> 00:23:48,079
They usually do not make direct
investments into startup companies.

437
00:23:49,064 --> 00:23:51,608
They would rather make
indirect investments

438
00:23:51,608 --> 00:23:55,828
by putting a larger chunk of money
into a venture capital fund,

439
00:23:56,528 --> 00:23:59,132
but occasionally, through some contacts

440
00:23:59,132 --> 00:24:01,047
or through luck,

441
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:04,496
you might be able to engage
a family office directly,

442
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:09,794
in which case it's going to be
on the larger side of the scale.

443
00:24:12,741 --> 00:24:16,279
And this would be relatively
large chunks of money

444
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:19,507
usually for a very
capital-intense business

445
00:24:19,507 --> 00:24:20,832
and for a later stage,

446
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:23,067
so you are in the expansion phase.

447
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:28,817
It's hard to say, how much money
gets spent by family offices

448
00:24:28,817 --> 00:24:32,257
in an individual company
startup investments.

449
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:34,598
There aren't a lot of statistics on it,

450
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:37,526
because it's a relatively
private operation.

451
00:24:37,964 --> 00:24:39,455
But some estimates have it at

452
00:24:39,455 --> 00:24:45,343
on the order of several million
to $10 million in investment.

453
00:24:45,815 --> 00:24:47,388
Venture capital.

454
00:24:47,388 --> 00:24:52,852
Here, the venture capital company
raises money through their own investors

455
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:55,240
and they turn around and invest that money

456
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:56,738
in startup companies,

457
00:24:56,738 --> 00:25:00,410
usually in the later stages
to provide expansion capital.

458
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:03,843
Generally speaking,
they are going to start

459
00:25:03,843 --> 00:25:07,086
in the couple of million dollar range

460
00:25:07,776 --> 00:25:10,689
and go up to maybe, let's say, 
$10 million

461
00:25:12,429 --> 00:25:14,469
in investment.

462
00:25:15,142 --> 00:25:17,720
With the typical amount invested

463
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,207
is on the order of $2-5 million,

464
00:25:21,207 --> 00:25:22,744
somewhere in there.

465
00:25:22,744 --> 00:25:24,539
And then finally, 
we have strategic partners.

466
00:25:24,539 --> 00:25:27,390
Strategic partners are large companies

467
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:31,102
that may want to make an equity investment

468
00:25:31,833 --> 00:25:33,374
in a startup company,

469
00:25:33,374 --> 00:25:34,761
and they will do it
for a variety of reasons

470
00:25:34,761 --> 00:25:38,759
which we will discuss in segment 4.4.

471
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:40,979
So here, we are going to talk about

472
00:25:40,979 --> 00:25:45,749
on the order of $1 million
to $25 plus million.

473
00:25:46,091 --> 00:25:49,005
With the typical investment
on the order of $10 million.

474
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:53,381
That gives an overview

475
00:25:54,482 --> 00:25:57,345
of the rough ranges,

476
00:25:57,345 --> 00:26:00,000
you can see there's
very, very big ranges on these,

477
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,824
and, as you can see, more or less

478
00:26:02,824 --> 00:26:04,234
as you move down the list,

479
00:26:04,234 --> 00:26:07,044
the amounts get higher and higher,

480
00:26:07,044 --> 00:26:10,588
and the engagement becomes higher,

481
00:26:10,588 --> 00:26:13,978
and the expected stage of investment

482
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:18,177
also becomes bigger

483
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,414
in the later stages.

484
00:26:20,414 --> 00:26:21,856
So, these ones at the bottom here

485
00:26:21,856 --> 00:26:24,165
are really more of 
the later stages investments

486
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:28,810
and the ones at the top are really
more of the early stage investments.

487
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:32,656
And the angels and the angels groups
are kind of in the middle.

488
00:26:32,656 --> 00:26:37,237
Let's talk about sales
or exit events for the founders.

489
00:26:38,073 --> 00:26:43,640
Usually, the founders are selling
some part of their company,

490
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,214
and the investors
are having the exit event.

491
00:26:47,499 --> 00:26:51,195
In other words,
the investor presumably gets

492
00:26:51,195 --> 00:26:53,299
all of their original investment back

493
00:26:53,299 --> 00:26:57,975
plus a return on the risk capital
that they have invested.

494
00:26:59,308 --> 00:27:03,079
These kinds of events
can happen in different ways.

495
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,571
Some of the most common ways

496
00:27:04,571 --> 00:27:09,471
are trade sales, IPOs, and to some degree,
management buyouts.

497
00:27:09,884 --> 00:27:13,013
Trade sales, as we just started talking
about of strategic partnership

498
00:27:13,013 --> 00:27:15,339
and an investor from a strategic partner,

499
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:21,282
and the big company
could eventually acquire

500
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:23,190
the startup company.

501
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:26,974
From the startup's point of view
that's called the trade sale.

502
00:27:26,974 --> 00:27:29,691
Sell the whole company
to another company.

503
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:32,444
Another option is

504
00:27:33,324 --> 00:27:38,569
the company can offer some percentage
of their shares to the public

505
00:27:39,584 --> 00:27:43,414
and this is the IPO
or the Initial Public Offering.

506
00:27:44,014 --> 00:27:46,952
This is done to raise
large amounts of money

507
00:27:46,952 --> 00:27:48,651
in the public capital market.

508
00:27:48,651 --> 00:27:51,137
There are a lot of legal implications,

509
00:27:52,137 --> 00:27:54,850
the founders often become
the minority shareholders

510
00:27:54,850 --> 00:28:01,910
and there is a legal framework
for how to govern the company

511
00:28:02,566 --> 00:28:04,382
after the IPO is done,

512
00:28:04,382 --> 00:28:07,931
but it does have the advantage of raising
a large amount of capital

513
00:28:07,931 --> 00:28:11,850
so that, in case there needs to be
some major investments made

514
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:14,121
or some big marketing expenses

515
00:28:14,121 --> 00:28:16,248
or other sorts of capital expenditures

516
00:28:16,248 --> 00:28:21,305
then, that would be a natural way
to go to raise the money.

517
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:23,920
The third way is a management buyout

518
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,447
and this is less common 
in a small company,

519
00:28:27,327 --> 00:28:30,571
but it could be
that the managers themselves,

520
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:32,567
the managers, executives, founders,

521
00:28:32,567 --> 00:28:36,654
would turn around and buy the company back

522
00:28:37,444 --> 00:28:39,494
from the other investors.

523
00:28:40,726 --> 00:28:42,813
And you've probably heard
of a <i>leverage buyout</i>

524
00:28:42,813 --> 00:28:44,123
and in a leverage buyout

525
00:28:44,123 --> 00:28:48,756
is where the managers borrow money
to make this transaction.

526
00:28:49,575 --> 00:28:54,161
This table represents
a summary of the sources

527
00:28:54,161 --> 00:28:57,716
of venture financing with an emphasis
on the more important ones

528
00:28:57,716 --> 00:29:00,618
that we are going to see
and we we are going to go into the details

529
00:29:00,618 --> 00:29:04,888
of these various sources
in the next few segments.
