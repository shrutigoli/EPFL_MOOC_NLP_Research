1
00:00:08,337 --> 00:00:11,888
All right, welcome back to 4.6.
This is about cash management.

2
00:00:12,751 --> 00:00:15,969
We're going to talk a lot
about the main problems of having cash.

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,319
Actually, there's really
only one main problem,

4
00:00:18,319 --> 00:00:20,139
which is just not having enough of it.

5
00:00:20,139 --> 00:00:23,603
The only question is, how do you
not have enough of it?

6
00:00:23,603 --> 00:00:25,141
Do you overspend what you have,

7
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:26,776
are people stealing from you, etc.

8
00:00:26,776 --> 00:00:28,721
We'll talk a little bit
about your "burn rate",

9
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:30,692
which we mentioned this past week,

10
00:00:30,692 --> 00:00:34,774
how to manage it and keep it lower.

11
00:00:34,774 --> 00:00:37,922
We will talk about
different kinds of accounts,

12
00:00:37,922 --> 00:00:40,251
and why you want
to keep your accounts separate.

13
00:00:40,251 --> 00:00:42,903
We'll discuss banking,
what to look for in a bank,

14
00:00:42,903 --> 00:00:46,830
and we'll also end up
wtih some non-bank solutions,

15
00:00:47,223 --> 00:00:50,285
including electronic payment-type options

16
00:00:50,285 --> 00:00:53,970
for people to avoid carrying around
excessive amounts of cash.

17
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:57,017
All right, let's discuss
overspending a little bit.

18
00:00:57,017 --> 00:01:01,977
So, just to make our definitions
a little bit clearer,

19
00:01:01,977 --> 00:01:03,934
what you need to do is look

20
00:01:03,934 --> 00:01:08,426
at all of your inflows
and outflows of money.

21
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:12,258
Now, for the sake of this exercise,
I'm suggesting

22
00:01:12,258 --> 00:01:15,022
that we ignore accounting classifications.

23
00:01:15,022 --> 00:01:16,852
What does that mean?

24
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:18,422
When you spend something--

25
00:01:18,422 --> 00:01:21,383
let's say that you were
to buy a new computer,

26
00:01:21,703 --> 00:01:25,137
and let's just say it costs $1,000--
there's lots of different ways

27
00:01:25,137 --> 00:01:29,014
of thinking about
how that money is being spent.

28
00:01:29,014 --> 00:01:30,922
Are you amortizing it,

29
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:34,274
over a period of a certain
number of years?

30
00:01:34,914 --> 00:01:38,205
Are you depreciating it? etc.

31
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:42,912
But what counts for our purposes today is,

32
00:01:43,252 --> 00:01:46,503
how much cash did it cost you
to buy that computer?

33
00:01:46,503 --> 00:01:49,415
If you had $1,000 in your bank account

34
00:01:49,415 --> 00:01:50,947
and you spent $1,000 on the computer,

35
00:01:50,947 --> 00:01:53,893
now you don't have any more money
in your bank account, okay?

36
00:01:53,893 --> 00:01:55,360
That's what we're
talking about-- your inflows.

37
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,939
Now, maybe someone paid you $100

38
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,319
because they owed you 
$100 from something else.

39
00:01:58,319 --> 00:02:01,099
So, now you have $100 in your account.

40
00:02:01,099 --> 00:02:02,954
So this is the idea, this is the exercise:

41
00:02:02,954 --> 00:02:06,311
we're looking at the inflows
and outflows of money,

42
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:09,214
regardless of their accounting definitions

43
00:02:09,214 --> 00:02:12,354
or whether you book it
as a profit or a loss or anything else,

44
00:02:12,354 --> 00:02:16,596
we're just looking at total cash
spent and brought in.

45
00:02:17,244 --> 00:02:19,038
Okay? 
So, in the beginning--

46
00:02:19,038 --> 00:02:20,933
as we've already mentioned
multiple times now--

47
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:24,709
you're often spending
more than you're taking in.

48
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:28,832
And the difference between
what you are spending

49
00:02:28,832 --> 00:02:33,596
and what you are bringing in
we call the "burn rate", okay?

50
00:02:33,596 --> 00:02:36,136
Some people also call it
the "net burn rate",

51
00:02:36,136 --> 00:02:41,029
to draw the distinction between that
and just the total outflows,

52
00:02:42,469 --> 00:02:45,208
which can be called the gross burn rate.

53
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:47,861
So if we just look at how much 
we're spending in every month,

54
00:02:47,861 --> 00:02:51,285
let's just say, on a monthly basis,
we will call that the "gross burn rate",

55
00:02:51,285 --> 00:02:55,019
and then, if we are indeed
bringing some money in,

56
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:59,302
then we would subtract that
from the amount we're spending

57
00:02:59,302 --> 00:03:01,512
and that would be the "net burn rate".

58
00:03:01,932 --> 00:03:04,115
Why would we want to do this exercise?

59
00:03:04,115 --> 00:03:06,557
Because we use
this burn rate to figure out

60
00:03:06,557 --> 00:03:09,850
how much time we have left
before we run out of cash.

61
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,454
That's called the "time to out of cash".

62
00:03:12,454 --> 00:03:15,657
So, if you have a certain amount
of money in your bank account,

63
00:03:15,657 --> 00:03:20,186
and you have a burn rate,
then you can divide one by the other

64
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:22,200
and come up with
how much time do you have

65
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,679
before you run out of cash.

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,059
Let's revisit the slide
that we looked at in 4.1

67
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:31,981
when we were talking about
how much money we need.

68
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:36,032
This was for fundraising purposes,
but now we're going to use it

69
00:03:36,032 --> 00:03:38,557
to think about burn rate.

70
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:42,040
So, as you can see from this chart here,

71
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:45,695
we have the years across the top.

72
00:03:49,168 --> 00:03:53,648
And down on the side, we have Revenues,

73
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:58,528
Costs, Profits and Cumulative Cash Flow.

74
00:03:58,528 --> 00:04:00,543
Again, we're not going to be too concerned

75
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:03,550
about the accounting definitions
of profits and losses here.

76
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:07,394
We're just mainly looking
at the cash flows.

77
00:04:07,994 --> 00:04:13,385
And so, as you can see,
in the first year, there are no revenues.

78
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:16,277
And in the second year, we have $50.

79
00:04:16,277 --> 00:04:19,826
We continue to spend
$100, $110, $120, $130, $140.

80
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,949
So, we always have costs, and eventually

81
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:25,358
we gain more and more revenues,

82
00:04:25,358 --> 00:04:30,725
so that we end up
losing $100 in the first year,

83
00:04:31,595 --> 00:04:33,871
and then that has a cumulative effect

84
00:04:33,871 --> 00:04:37,136
of having $100 less than we started with

85
00:04:37,136 --> 00:04:38,718
at the end of the first year.

86
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:44,543
So now, what we're going to do,
is we are going to zoom in on year two,

87
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:49,459
and think about how this cash
is flowing in year two.

88
00:04:51,122 --> 00:04:53,886
In year two, we have
$50 revenues coming in,

89
00:04:53,886 --> 00:04:56,871
and we have $110 gross costs going out.

90
00:04:57,391 --> 00:05:03,702
So, therefore, we are going to be
$60 less at the end of year two

91
00:05:03,702 --> 00:05:06,204
than we were at the end of year one.

92
00:05:06,204 --> 00:05:07,978
Okay, let's make
one further assumption here,

93
00:05:07,978 --> 00:05:11,447
and that is that we started
this whole exercise

94
00:05:11,447 --> 00:05:14,194
with $150 in the bank.

95
00:05:14,794 --> 00:05:20,394
Now, we mentioned already that 
after the first year, we were down $100.

96
00:05:20,394 --> 00:05:24,240
So, therefore, if we started with $150,
we would end up

97
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,259
with only $50 at the end
of the first year.

98
00:05:32,732 --> 00:05:35,573
Now, if we look at the year two revenues,

99
00:05:36,605 --> 00:05:38,663
you can see that
we're going to bring in $50,

100
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:42,427
which is a little over $4 per month.

101
00:05:43,599 --> 00:05:48,823
And, furthermore, if we look
at the total costs, that's $110,

102
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:51,581
that's just a little over
$9 per month.

103
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,593
So, we would say that our gross burn rate

104
00:06:03,973 --> 00:06:07,492
was about a little over $9 per month.

105
00:06:08,386 --> 00:06:10,358
Now, the net burn rate,

106
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:15,565
or what most people would just
call the burn rate, is $5 per month.

107
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:21,546
And, therefore, what we will do,

108
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:24,288
is we look at how much cash
we have on hand,

109
00:06:24,948 --> 00:06:28,196
at the end of the first year,
the beginning of the second year,

110
00:06:28,196 --> 00:06:31,544
and now we know that we have $50

111
00:06:31,544 --> 00:06:36,208
and we're going to spend,
on average, $5 per month, roughly.

112
00:06:36,208 --> 00:06:40,754
So that means we have ten months
until we run out of cash.

113
00:06:45,803 --> 00:06:49,384
All right, let's think about
why the burn rate is so important.

114
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:55,386
Obviously, time to out of cash
gives you some rough estimate

115
00:06:55,386 --> 00:06:58,461
about how much longer you can continue on

116
00:06:58,461 --> 00:07:02,499
with your current operations
if you maintain the status quo--

117
00:07:02,499 --> 00:07:05,029
you don't change anything,
you just bring in the money

118
00:07:05,029 --> 00:07:06,282
that you expect to bring in

119
00:07:06,282 --> 00:07:08,212
and pay out the money
you expect to pay out,

120
00:07:08,212 --> 00:07:12,161
and how much you have in the bank,
therefore it gives you

121
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:15,262
a little estimate
about how much longer

122
00:07:15,262 --> 00:07:17,843
you can, more or less, stay in business.

123
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,104
Okay, I could say it helps you

124
00:07:20,104 --> 00:07:22,200
with the discussion
about growth and scale,

125
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,762
because sometimes
we need to sacrifice cash

126
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:29,364
to gain scale in the future.

127
00:07:29,364 --> 00:07:32,313
We've talked a little about
growing and scaling your business

128
00:07:33,033 --> 00:07:37,292
last week, and so this might help
with the discussion, right?

129
00:07:37,292 --> 00:07:40,263
If you know you have
a lot of time to out of cash,

130
00:07:41,023 --> 00:07:43,224
and your burn rate is relatively low,

131
00:07:43,224 --> 00:07:47,536
then you might want to make a move

132
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:51,434
which would then bring up
your ability to scale up your business

133
00:07:51,434 --> 00:07:53,835
and have a higher growth opportunity.

134
00:07:53,835 --> 00:07:56,282
If you think you're burning too quickly,

135
00:07:56,282 --> 00:08:00,366
you might have to scale back
a little bit, which then might limit,

136
00:08:00,366 --> 00:08:04,217
at some point, your future
growth possibilities.

137
00:08:04,397 --> 00:08:06,066
It depends on
the infrastructure investments

138
00:08:06,066 --> 00:08:09,942
that you need to make to be able 
to scale up your business.

139
00:08:11,042 --> 00:08:16,469
Now, how long should you have
before you run out of cash?

140
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:21,639
Most people would say
that you need to start getting worried

141
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:24,596
when you have less than six months to go,

142
00:08:24,596 --> 00:08:27,273
that you really need
to cut back at that point,

143
00:08:27,273 --> 00:08:29,584
and start fundraising or raising revenue.

144
00:08:29,584 --> 00:08:34,721
So, you need to attack
one or all three of those points, right?

145
00:08:34,721 --> 00:08:37,148
You've got the total amount
in your account,

146
00:08:37,148 --> 00:08:39,039
in your bank, or whatever cash on hand,

147
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,754
and then you've got
your revenues coming in, your inflows,

148
00:08:42,754 --> 00:08:44,402
and you've got your cash flowing out.

149
00:08:44,402 --> 00:08:49,380
So you need to either build
the amount that you have to start,

150
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:53,529
your endowment of assets, via fundraising,

151
00:08:53,529 --> 00:08:58,360
you need to increase
your revenues, via sales,

152
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:04,267
and/or you need to cut
your costs, your cash flow.

153
00:09:04,267 --> 00:09:06,329
We'll talk about that in a few minutes.

154
00:09:07,469 --> 00:09:10,282
The burn rate also helps you
plan your fundraising,

155
00:09:10,282 --> 00:09:11,627
just as I mentioned.

156
00:09:11,627 --> 00:09:15,517
So, you think you might need 
to raise funds,

157
00:09:15,517 --> 00:09:17,389
you're starting to run out of--

158
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:19,629
people call it "running out of runway".

159
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:21,729
So it's as if you're landing a plane,

160
00:09:21,729 --> 00:09:26,497
and you've only got a certain amount
of runway left in front of you,

161
00:09:26,497 --> 00:09:28,900
so when you start running out of runway,
you start getting worried.

162
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,555
It helps to plan
your fundraising a little bit.

163
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,713
"Gee, I've only got a year left,

164
00:09:32,713 --> 00:09:34,284
I need to start thinking about that now."

165
00:09:34,284 --> 00:09:39,043
And if you recall back
to the segment this week on fundraising,

166
00:09:39,043 --> 00:09:40,577
we went through the rough estimate

167
00:09:40,577 --> 00:09:46,306
about how many months it takes
to get certain amounts of funding.

168
00:09:46,676 --> 00:09:48,657
So, this will help you make your plans,

169
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:50,589
because if you know
you have a couple years,

170
00:09:50,589 --> 00:09:52,646
then you can take a little longer,

171
00:09:52,646 --> 00:09:56,807
and try to raise money
from a source that might take longer.

172
00:09:56,807 --> 00:09:58,053
Otherwise, you may be limited

173
00:09:58,053 --> 00:10:01,503
to some relatively short-term
sources of financing.

174
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:06,935
It also gives a signal to the investors
what you're looking for.

175
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:11,205
You know, are you looking for
a big growth opportunity,

176
00:10:11,205 --> 00:10:13,893
are you looking for a big rollout, 
a marketing campaign?

177
00:10:14,103 --> 00:10:16,822
And so, how much money you're raising

178
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:18,500
relative to your burn rate

179
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,837
can also be an important
signal to investors.

180
00:10:24,343 --> 00:10:29,322
And then, finally, the burn rate
can point out weaknesses

181
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:31,238
in your revenue model.

182
00:10:31,238 --> 00:10:37,602
So, if you have revenues that 
come in only every once in a while,

183
00:10:39,712 --> 00:10:42,344
and something happens
between now and the next time

184
00:10:42,344 --> 00:10:47,127
your revenues come in,
you could end up getting into a position

185
00:10:47,127 --> 00:10:50,677
where you are out of cash faster 
than you thought you were going to be.

186
00:10:50,677 --> 00:10:54,268
So, there are vulnerabilities exist
when your outflows are constant--

187
00:10:54,268 --> 00:10:55,739
which is usually the case,
because you're usually

188
00:10:55,739 --> 00:10:57,756
spending money on salaries.

189
00:10:57,756 --> 00:11:00,497
And when your outflows are constant,

190
00:11:00,497 --> 00:11:02,407
and your inflows are punctuated--

191
00:11:02,407 --> 00:11:05,336
so, only every once in a while
do you actually get an inflow--

192
00:11:05,336 --> 00:11:07,515
you have a vulnerability there,

193
00:11:07,515 --> 00:11:09,911
that you might run out of cash
before your next inflow.

194
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:11,454
Let's look at a little example of that.

195
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:14,412
All right, this is just
zooming in on year two

196
00:11:14,412 --> 00:11:16,342
from the prior example, right?

197
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,806
So, we still have the same $50 revenues,

198
00:11:19,806 --> 00:11:22,267
and we still have the same $110 costs,

199
00:11:22,267 --> 00:11:25,842
but now we're going to break it down
on a month-by-month basis,

200
00:11:25,842 --> 00:11:28,637
and remember, we started this year
with $50 in the bank.

201
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:31,019
And what you see here that stands out is,

202
00:11:31,019 --> 00:11:33,625
we do not have a recurring revenue source.

203
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:37,371
We have six months without any revenues,

204
00:11:37,371 --> 00:11:42,123
and then, in month seven
we expect to receive $40.

205
00:11:42,372 --> 00:11:45,491
However, our costs are almost constant.

206
00:11:45,491 --> 00:11:47,889
There's a couple major expenses
we have later in the year,

207
00:11:47,889 --> 00:11:50,722
but we have $8 a month
for eight months in a row.

208
00:11:51,542 --> 00:11:54,221
And then we have an additional cost
of $15 in month nine.

209
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:55,771
Now, if you think about this,

210
00:11:55,771 --> 00:11:58,420
it's actually not
a great situation to be in, right?

211
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:01,336
You started with $50
at the beginning of the year,

212
00:12:01,336 --> 00:12:05,802
and now you're going to spend
six times eight--

213
00:12:07,672 --> 00:12:12,271
you're going to spend $48
before you get your $40.

214
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:16,624
And so, you only have $2 left
at the end of six months,

215
00:12:17,964 --> 00:12:21,266
and then you're going to start
incurring costs in month seven,

216
00:12:21,266 --> 00:12:24,586
and so if there's a delay
of these revenues,

217
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:28,313
you will run out of cash
before you can receive the money.

218
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:31,511
If the economy tanks
and the person decides

219
00:12:31,511 --> 00:12:34,199
they don't want to do it anymore--
or if it's a company,

220
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:37,019
if you're expecting money
from a company, from a big customer,

221
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:41,460
this also shows you-- you're depending
on a major event here

222
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:44,080
to help keep you afloat.

223
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:48,261
So, this is kind of a dangerous situation
to be in, right here.

224
00:12:48,261 --> 00:12:52,390
We got this big revenue coming in
that's paying for the whole year,

225
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:54,978
essentially, what you are counting on.

226
00:12:55,277 --> 00:13:00,612
And you are going to run out of money
before six months,

227
00:13:00,612 --> 00:13:03,504
or around seven months,
if that doesn't come through.

228
00:13:04,187 --> 00:13:08,260
All right, let's talk about shrinkage.
What is shrinkage?

229
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:15,225
Shrinakge is often used
when people steal from you.

230
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:21,132
In many cases, we consider shrinkage

231
00:13:21,132 --> 00:13:23,951
when it's insiders who steal from you.

232
00:13:24,548 --> 00:13:28,128
So, it's not necessarily
someone stealing--

233
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:31,155
we'll talk about that next,
someone just robbing you or something--

234
00:13:31,155 --> 00:13:34,930
this is usually someone taking a product

235
00:13:36,491 --> 00:13:38,743
before it gets a chance
to be delivered to the customer.

236
00:13:39,031 --> 00:13:40,438
It could be physical products,

237
00:13:40,438 --> 00:13:43,445
that are being pilfered
out of inventory and then sold

238
00:13:43,445 --> 00:13:45,969
or used at home by employees.

239
00:13:46,479 --> 00:13:48,904
However, it can refer to almost any aspect

240
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:53,188
of insiders siphoning money 
or assets from the company.

241
00:13:54,597 --> 00:13:58,019
And this is a little bit apocryphal,

242
00:13:59,089 --> 00:14:04,176
but rumor has it-- guess which 
person in a startup

243
00:14:04,176 --> 00:14:09,118
is the most likely to pilfer assets 
from the company?

244
00:14:09,118 --> 00:14:12,840
This doesn't work very well
on the online platform here,

245
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:16,503
but let me see
if I can show you what this is.

246
00:14:16,503 --> 00:14:18,180
You see this?

247
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:20,220
Oh, this won't work
because of the lighting.

248
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:22,398
And it's pre-recorded!

249
00:14:23,089 --> 00:14:25,037
But have a look in the mirror.

250
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:30,943
In general, the person most likely
to pilfer assets from the company

251
00:14:30,943 --> 00:14:33,428
is in fact the founder.

252
00:14:35,318 --> 00:14:41,944
The founder has access,
especially in the initial stages,

253
00:14:41,944 --> 00:14:45,127
and the founder is actually
touching the money

254
00:14:45,127 --> 00:14:47,265
of the company as it comes in,

255
00:14:47,265 --> 00:14:53,193
and therefore it's often thought
that founders are highly likely

256
00:14:53,193 --> 00:14:58,607
to be the prime suspects
when it comes to shrinkage.

257
00:14:58,607 --> 00:15:03,678
So, theft; let's talk a little bit
about theft, quickly.

258
00:15:03,678 --> 00:15:05,977
Depending on how much cash
you have on hand,

259
00:15:05,977 --> 00:15:08,080
how much you carry around with you,

260
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:13,077
theft can be a very important aspect

261
00:15:13,077 --> 00:15:15,533
in your cash management plans.

262
00:15:16,854 --> 00:15:21,425
So, imagine if you get robbed,
and you're carrying around

263
00:15:21,425 --> 00:15:25,032
half the cash that you're expecting
to use for the next <i>year</i>,

264
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,607
and imagine what that does
to your time to out of cash--

265
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:30,475
well, that cuts it in half.

266
00:15:30,475 --> 00:15:33,782
So, it's a very serious problem,

267
00:15:33,782 --> 00:15:38,084
and we're going to think about,
for the next few minutes,

268
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:45,402
how do you minimize handling so much cash?

269
00:15:46,815 --> 00:15:49,931
It's tempting,
from the point of view of shrinkage--

270
00:15:49,931 --> 00:15:55,335
it's also bad for security purposes
for being robbed.

271
00:15:55,567 --> 00:16:01,086
And leaving it at home in giant piles--
may also not be optimal,

272
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,985
because your home can also get robbed,

273
00:16:03,985 --> 00:16:05,812
or you may get robbed yourself

274
00:16:05,812 --> 00:16:08,879
when you're wandering back and forth
carrying cash.

275
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:12,176
So, in general, if there's a way around

276
00:16:12,176 --> 00:16:15,148
not carrying large amounts
of cash with you,

277
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:16,911
it's actually preferable,

278
00:16:16,911 --> 00:16:18,556
from lots of different points of view.

279
00:16:18,556 --> 00:16:20,654
Okay, let's think about the burn rate.

280
00:16:20,654 --> 00:16:25,278
What can we do to get
this burn rate down?

281
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:31,253
Well, first things first,
you need to make a plan.

282
00:16:32,250 --> 00:16:37,729
Make a plan simply means
make a monthly and annual plan,

283
00:16:37,729 --> 00:16:42,216
with projections--
so, for the last year or so,

284
00:16:42,926 --> 00:16:44,596
how much have you actually spent?

285
00:16:44,596 --> 00:16:46,687
How much have you brought in?

286
00:16:46,687 --> 00:16:50,911
And make a calculation about
what your actual monthly burn rate is,

287
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:54,964
and then make a projection
for the next one year into the future,

288
00:16:55,724 --> 00:16:59,737
how much you are planning on spending

289
00:16:59,737 --> 00:17:02,018
and how much you're expecting to receive.

290
00:17:02,308 --> 00:17:06,935
Then you can make the calculation
about the time to out of cash.

291
00:17:07,836 --> 00:17:12,091
However, even beyond your net burn rate,

292
00:17:12,091 --> 00:17:14,161
think about your gross burn rate.

293
00:17:14,161 --> 00:17:19,431
When it comes time to make
a major expenditure, ask yourself,

294
00:17:19,431 --> 00:17:23,152
"Do I really need this? 
Do I need to spend this money right now?

295
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:25,371
You know, could I test and see

296
00:17:25,371 --> 00:17:27,019
if there's something else I could do?

297
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:31,180
Could I wait a little bit longer,
postpone it for a month or two,

298
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:34,740
and think about whether
I can live wthout this purchase?"

299
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:37,742
So that's trying to avoid
emotional purchases.

300
00:17:37,742 --> 00:17:42,912
You know, people who study
shopping behavior and marketing

301
00:17:42,912 --> 00:17:49,717
know a lot about
emotion that can be engaged

302
00:17:49,717 --> 00:17:51,077
when you make a purchase.

303
00:17:51,077 --> 00:17:52,258
It can make you feel really good.

304
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:56,067
It can make you feel
less depressed or whatever,

305
00:17:56,067 --> 00:17:59,349
it can evoke emotions,
and what you want to do

306
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:03,748
as the entrepreneur managing your cash,

307
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,732
you want to avoid emotional purchases
and really think,

308
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:09,224
"Okay, can I live without this?

309
00:18:09,224 --> 00:18:11,134
Can I delay this a little bit,

310
00:18:11,134 --> 00:18:13,999
and see what other quick fixes
I could do instead of this?"

311
00:18:14,707 --> 00:18:18,658
Outsourcing when possible--
so, if it's some task,

312
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:20,999
rather than hiring somone to do the task,

313
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:24,087
maybe you can simply
outsource the task to somebody

314
00:18:24,087 --> 00:18:27,633
and pay just on a task basis,
as opposed to paying a salary basis.

315
00:18:27,633 --> 00:18:30,147
You don't want to bring on 
lots of extra expenses.

316
00:18:30,147 --> 00:18:31,378
Now, be careful.

317
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:34,872
There's a note here about,
when you outsource things,

318
00:18:34,872 --> 00:18:37,133
you obviously don't want
to outsource things

319
00:18:37,133 --> 00:18:40,356
that can have
competitive advantage for you.

320
00:18:40,356 --> 00:18:41,992
We'll talk about that more next week,

321
00:18:41,992 --> 00:18:46,995
but you don't want to outsource
the one product developer

322
00:18:46,995 --> 00:18:49,993
that knows how to make
what you want to do.

323
00:18:49,993 --> 00:18:51,732
There, you want to bring the person in

324
00:18:51,732 --> 00:18:53,608
and have the person work for you.

325
00:18:53,608 --> 00:18:57,570
On the other hand,
if it's service that you need

326
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,323
to take care of someone
to mail packages for you,

327
00:19:00,323 --> 00:19:07,125
that's not something that's
going to be very bad if it leaks out

328
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,796
into the general public domain.

329
00:19:09,796 --> 00:19:11,376
So, there, you might want to consider

330
00:19:11,376 --> 00:19:15,781
just hiring someone to, for example, 
mail packages for you or whatever it is.

331
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:19,657
Cut your losses. Don't overextend.
What does that mean?

332
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:23,638
That means, when you've got
your portfolio, you've got some ideas,

333
00:19:23,638 --> 00:19:26,176
you have someone ask you
to extend your product,

334
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:29,696
or you've got an idea for a little pivot
or some other new thing,

335
00:19:29,696 --> 00:19:32,024
you don't want to keep
all the losers lying around

336
00:19:32,024 --> 00:19:33,482
and keep spending money on them.

337
00:19:33,482 --> 00:19:37,563
So, make some decisions
about cutting your losses

338
00:19:37,563 --> 00:19:39,418
so you don't keep spending money

339
00:19:39,418 --> 00:19:41,948
on things that will never
pay for themselves.

340
00:19:42,357 --> 00:19:45,568
And, finally, as the founder, yes,

341
00:19:45,568 --> 00:19:47,883
you may have to cut your own salary.

342
00:19:47,883 --> 00:19:53,443
So, that's not very much fun,
but, in fact, you may have to do it,

343
00:19:53,953 --> 00:19:56,206
before you cut anyone else's salary--

344
00:19:56,206 --> 00:20:00,734
one, as a signal; two, to keep morale--
to save money.

345
00:20:01,214 --> 00:20:02,610
Plan your fundraising.

346
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:05,250
So, there you make your projections,

347
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,020
you want to have a look,
and as we've mentioned before,

348
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:10,614
you don't want to get into
that "danger zone"

349
00:20:10,614 --> 00:20:13,755
of six months or less of time remaining

350
00:20:13,755 --> 00:20:15,631
before you run out of cash.

351
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:18,258
So, you want to plan
your fundraising accordingly,

352
00:20:18,258 --> 00:20:23,211
and start looking for money
when you need it less,

353
00:20:23,211 --> 00:20:25,024
when you're not desperate for it.

354
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:29,107
And, finally, obviously, try and bring in
recurring revenue streams.

355
00:20:29,107 --> 00:20:30,738
If you can get a subscription-type thing,

356
00:20:30,738 --> 00:20:33,347
where people are paying all the time,

357
00:20:33,347 --> 00:20:35,037
or your customers are paying--

358
00:20:35,037 --> 00:20:37,229
if it doesn't have to be
to the general public,

359
00:20:37,229 --> 00:20:41,503
it could be you have some company,
B-to-B-type business,

360
00:20:41,503 --> 00:20:44,460
that are your customers,
but they pay on a recurring basis

361
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:47,394
as opposed to a one-time thing
with a big sale cycle.

362
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:52,830
That's obviously going to be better
for you, for your cash flow,

363
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:55,230
and it'll also be better
for your cash management.

364
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,926
Okay, keeping your accounts separate.

365
00:20:56,926 --> 00:20:58,639
Now, you definitely want to do this.

366
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:01,658
You don't have to have
a bank account for this,

367
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:04,310
but you want to keep
your company cash separate

368
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:07,046
from your personal cash,
and if you have a bank account,

369
00:21:07,046 --> 00:21:09,776
then you want to keep
your company bank account

370
00:21:09,776 --> 00:21:11,679
separate from your personal bank account.

371
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:13,191
If you have a credit card,
you want to keep

372
00:21:13,191 --> 00:21:16,021
your company credit card separate
from your personal credit card.

373
00:21:16,021 --> 00:21:19,999
Because, you don't want
to put yourself in the position

374
00:21:19,999 --> 00:21:24,549
to borrow money
from your own company, you know?

375
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:27,477
And the time will probably happen
at some point

376
00:21:27,477 --> 00:21:31,024
where you might need some money,
and then you might say,

377
00:21:31,024 --> 00:21:34,755
"Oh, well, I'm not so sure if this is--

378
00:21:34,755 --> 00:21:36,998
yeah, it's okay,
it's all my money anyway."

379
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:40,400
It's kind of a slippery slope, after that,

380
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,867
before you start spending
a lot of the company's money.

381
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:44,775
So, it's better to keep them separate,

382
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:47,603
and then, if you're going to borrow money
from your company,

383
00:21:47,603 --> 00:21:49,055
then you know you're doing it,

384
00:21:49,055 --> 00:21:51,215
and maybe you can write a note to yourself

385
00:21:51,215 --> 00:21:53,217
to pay yourself back with interest,

386
00:21:53,217 --> 00:21:56,082
but at least you're keeping
all of your books

387
00:21:56,082 --> 00:21:58,196
and all of your assets separate,

388
00:21:58,196 --> 00:22:02,751
between your company
and your personal financial plans.

389
00:22:02,751 --> 00:22:06,371
Now, I have to make
a short digression here,

390
00:22:06,371 --> 00:22:09,757
because I noticed we haven't
talked about this yet, up til now.

391
00:22:11,107 --> 00:22:13,919
Keeping these accounts separate
is good practice.

392
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:16,775
It's good to prevent shrinkage.

393
00:22:16,775 --> 00:22:19,929
However, it won't necessarily protect you

394
00:22:19,929 --> 00:22:22,443
from other legal liabilities,
so you have to be careful here.

395
00:22:22,443 --> 00:22:26,613
I'm going to make
a short digression, but--

396
00:22:26,613 --> 00:22:29,838
remember that you probably,
at some point--

397
00:22:29,838 --> 00:22:31,898
if you think there's a liability issue,

398
00:22:31,898 --> 00:22:35,075
you should probably think about
how that will play out

399
00:22:35,075 --> 00:22:37,379
with your own personal assets

400
00:22:37,509 --> 00:22:40,781
and your corporate form
will play a large role in that.

401
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,847
Let's talk about that
for just a few seconds.

402
00:22:42,847 --> 00:22:45,386
Okay, let's talk a bit about liability
and corporate form.

403
00:22:45,386 --> 00:22:50,266
So, in most countries, there is
going to be a distinction drawn

404
00:22:50,266 --> 00:22:54,961
between corporate forms
that protect the owners

405
00:22:54,961 --> 00:22:59,159
from liability for what happens 
with the company,

406
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:01,989
and those that do not protect
the owner or owners.

407
00:23:01,989 --> 00:23:04,539
Okay, so, there are two
main categories here.

408
00:23:04,539 --> 00:23:06,887
Now, these details differ
from country to country,

409
00:23:06,887 --> 00:23:11,885
so it's important that you understand

410
00:23:11,885 --> 00:23:15,115
the rules in your own country.

411
00:23:15,115 --> 00:23:17,816
However, if you think about
just generally speaking--

412
00:23:17,816 --> 00:23:18,994
two main categories.

413
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:22,901
One is when you have 
your liability unlimited,

414
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:26,807
and the other is when you have
your liability limited.

415
00:23:26,807 --> 00:23:28,073
So, what does that mean?

416
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:31,669
Liability is when you are held responsible

417
00:23:31,669 --> 00:23:35,007
for any action that your company takes.

418
00:23:35,738 --> 00:23:39,528
So, if you make a product
that ends up injuring somebody,

419
00:23:39,528 --> 00:23:46,900
then you may be personally liable
to pay some kind of damages

420
00:23:47,309 --> 00:23:49,994
to the person who was injured.

421
00:23:49,994 --> 00:23:53,024
If your company made someone--

422
00:23:54,504 --> 00:23:57,874
thorugh negligence, or whatever--
lose money,

423
00:23:57,874 --> 00:24:01,945
then you may be held personally liable

424
00:24:01,945 --> 00:24:04,612
to pay damages to that person.

425
00:24:04,612 --> 00:24:08,042
So, that's the liability angle here,

426
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:11,989
and what we're going to do is,
we're going to draw some distinctions.

427
00:24:11,989 --> 00:24:13,406
The first two on this list are the ones

428
00:24:13,406 --> 00:24:16,542
where your liability is--
technically-- unlimited,

429
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:19,496
or it's at least only limited
by your own personal assets.

430
00:24:20,423 --> 00:24:24,155
Sole proprietorship is when
you are in business for yourself,

431
00:24:24,928 --> 00:24:30,782
and your company is an extension
of your own person.

432
00:24:31,191 --> 00:24:34,319
So, you're the only owner
in a sole proprietorship,

433
00:24:34,319 --> 00:24:36,603
and anything that happens
with that company

434
00:24:36,603 --> 00:24:40,160
is going back to you as an individual.

435
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:42,104
Now, you can also have a partnership.

436
00:24:42,104 --> 00:24:44,068
Some partnerships have limited liability;

437
00:24:44,068 --> 00:24:46,811
some have unlimited liability.

438
00:24:47,969 --> 00:24:50,828
Many partnerships
are unlimited in liability,

439
00:24:50,828 --> 00:24:57,028
where <i>all</i> the partners
are jointly liable for any problems

440
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,956
that occur with the partnership,

441
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,471
but not all, so check the details.

442
00:25:03,551 --> 00:25:06,644
Then we have the so-called
limited liability companies,

443
00:25:06,774 --> 00:25:10,394
people call them LLCs,
and what that basically means is

444
00:25:10,394 --> 00:25:15,076
that the owners are shielded

445
00:25:15,076 --> 00:25:18,706
from any action the company takes.

446
00:25:18,706 --> 00:25:20,343
The company may have assets,

447
00:25:20,343 --> 00:25:25,203
and those assets
are of course up for grabs

448
00:25:25,203 --> 00:25:27,257
in any legal action that might happen

449
00:25:27,257 --> 00:25:30,247
if the company causes damage to somebody.

450
00:25:30,247 --> 00:25:36,758
But, the owner's assets cannot be mixed
with the company's assets

451
00:25:36,758 --> 00:25:39,277
in any kind of legal action.

452
00:25:39,277 --> 00:25:41,701
And, usually, most countries
distinguish between

453
00:25:41,701 --> 00:25:45,749
sort of smaller LLCs and larger LLCs--

454
00:25:47,289 --> 00:25:49,909
a smaller one
meaning less than, you know,

455
00:25:49,909 --> 00:25:54,903
a certain number of shareholders.
20, 50, whatever.

456
00:25:56,876 --> 00:26:00,915
And the large ones having 
a large number of shareholders,

457
00:26:01,715 --> 00:26:04,454
which a lot of people call
a public corporation.

458
00:26:04,917 --> 00:26:10,698
In such cases, the shareholders themselves
are not held liable

459
00:26:10,698 --> 00:26:13,552
for the actions of the companies.

460
00:26:14,619 --> 00:26:16,491
What's the difference
between these different forms?

461
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:21,548
Well, the ones on the early part
of this list here

462
00:26:21,548 --> 00:26:24,028
are easy to set up.

463
00:26:24,028 --> 00:26:26,488
They don't cost very much, if anything.

464
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:30,420
Sole proprietorship
costs almost nothing to set up.

465
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:35,755
Whereas, a public corporation
costs a lot--

466
00:26:35,755 --> 00:26:37,792
not to mention the capitalization 
on it that you need

467
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:40,118
just to form the corporation--

468
00:26:40,118 --> 00:26:43,241
but there's a lot of ongoing expenses.

469
00:26:43,241 --> 00:26:48,695
Accounting expenses, legal expenses, etc.

470
00:26:50,905 --> 00:26:54,699
Sole proprietorship--
very easy, very cheap to set up,

471
00:26:54,699 --> 00:27:00,124
and a public corporation,
super expensive to set up and run.

472
00:27:00,945 --> 00:27:03,044
On the other hand, it's a tradeoff,

473
00:27:03,044 --> 00:27:06,741
because the sole proprietorship
has unlimited liability,

474
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:10,732
and therefore you are going 
to be held responsible

475
00:27:10,732 --> 00:27:13,976
for the actions of your company,
whereas with a public corporation,

476
00:27:13,976 --> 00:27:17,494
you are completely--
except in very specific situations

477
00:27:17,494 --> 00:27:19,441
which we don't have time
to get into today--

478
00:27:19,441 --> 00:27:22,847
you are <i>not</i> personally liable
for the actions of your company.

479
00:27:23,632 --> 00:27:25,776
Speaking of which,
I put my disclaimer on here--

480
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:29,599
I'm not offering you legal
nor financial advice here.

481
00:27:29,599 --> 00:27:34,286
You have to check in your own country,
what the rules are

482
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:38,426
for liability and corporate form,
which are can be changing,

483
00:27:38,426 --> 00:27:40,745
and regardless of what I say here,

484
00:27:40,745 --> 00:27:44,950
every country will have its own rules
about legal liability,

485
00:27:44,950 --> 00:27:47,531
and you should familiarize yourself
with those things,

486
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:51,114
especially if you're creating
a product or service

487
00:27:51,114 --> 00:27:58,018
that has the possibility
of incurring damage on some party,

488
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,924
whatever form that damage might take.

489
00:28:00,924 --> 00:28:03,767
So, I'm not telling you what to do,
I'm just telling you

490
00:28:03,767 --> 00:28:08,969
what people think about
when they're thinking about liability,

491
00:28:09,165 --> 00:28:11,976
and let's get back to bank accounts now.

492
00:28:12,397 --> 00:28:15,378
Okay, practical matter; choosing a bank.

493
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:22,159
It's important, if possible,
to get some kind of banking

494
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,741
or financial services
when you own a company.

495
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,639
So, one of the first things
you may consider

496
00:28:29,639 --> 00:28:32,027
is actually getting a bank account,

497
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:34,704
or some other kind of non-banking service,

498
00:28:34,704 --> 00:28:36,164
which we'll talk about next.

499
00:28:36,164 --> 00:28:38,180
So, if it's going to be a physical bank,

500
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,928
let's think about the following things:

501
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:43,324
What is the convenience of this bank?

502
00:28:44,044 --> 00:28:46,743
Where is the location
relative to where you live,

503
00:28:47,663 --> 00:28:49,979
where your office is, etc.?

504
00:28:49,979 --> 00:28:52,689
Are there restrictions on the locations?

505
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:55,619
Some banks, believe it or not,
actually charge you a lot more

506
00:28:55,619 --> 00:28:59,266
if you don't go to the local branch
in which you set up the account,

507
00:28:59,684 --> 00:29:02,114
in which case-- which may be fine for you,

508
00:29:02,114 --> 00:29:04,814
but you may want to do banking

509
00:29:04,814 --> 00:29:06,548
in multiple branches of the same bank,

510
00:29:06,548 --> 00:29:08,798
in which case you don't want
to have those kinds of restrictions.

511
00:29:09,428 --> 00:29:14,592
Having a real contact person,
in other words, not just a call center

512
00:29:14,592 --> 00:29:18,907
but someone who is
a business customer service person

513
00:29:19,092 --> 00:29:21,883
at the bank, a real person
whose name that you have,

514
00:29:21,883 --> 00:29:24,792
that you can interact with, 
is also a plus.

515
00:29:25,155 --> 00:29:28,139
And, how long it takes
to set up an account,

516
00:29:28,139 --> 00:29:33,522
which can vary from a few minutes
to a few months,

517
00:29:33,522 --> 00:29:36,771
depending on the bank, the country, etc.

518
00:29:36,771 --> 00:29:38,689
You definitely want
to shop around a little bit,

519
00:29:38,689 --> 00:29:40,812
and try and get something 
that's convenient.

520
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:43,226
Do they offer electronic banking services?

521
00:29:43,226 --> 00:29:44,584
We'll talk a little bit more
about that next,

522
00:29:44,584 --> 00:29:48,640
but, I consider that
to be a fairly important factor.

523
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,976
In fact, to me,
that's a super important factor.

524
00:29:50,976 --> 00:29:53,916
See if they offer
electronic banking services.

525
00:29:54,674 --> 00:29:57,172
Find out about their clearing
and other transaction times.

526
00:29:57,172 --> 00:30:02,888
So, in other words, if you--
if it's a check-based economy,

527
00:30:02,888 --> 00:30:05,628
then when you write a check,
how long does it take

528
00:30:05,628 --> 00:30:07,583
for your check to clear?

529
00:30:07,583 --> 00:30:10,032
When someone writes you a check
and you deposit it,

530
00:30:10,032 --> 00:30:12,788
how long does it take
before they credit your account?

531
00:30:12,788 --> 00:30:16,168
Those kinds of transaction times
are important.

532
00:30:16,168 --> 00:30:18,251
If there's a linked debit card,
how long does it take

533
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:22,616
for them to debit and credit
for the debit card?

534
00:30:23,246 --> 00:30:25,244
And, what are the total costs
to operating the account?

535
00:30:25,244 --> 00:30:30,318
Look and see-- check for
the minimum balance fees, checking fees,

536
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:33,682
interest, overdraft protection--

537
00:30:33,682 --> 00:30:37,318
you name it, you want to look
at your total costs

538
00:30:37,318 --> 00:30:38,846
for operating this account,

539
00:30:38,846 --> 00:30:41,537
and try and find one
where the costs are relatively low.

540
00:30:41,537 --> 00:30:45,856
Finally, let's talk a little bit
about non-bank transactions,

541
00:30:45,856 --> 00:30:48,910
or electronic services,
more generally speaking.

542
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:53,081
This helps you avoid
large cash transactions,

543
00:30:53,081 --> 00:30:56,321
so you don't have to walk around
carrying a giant wad of cash

544
00:30:56,321 --> 00:31:01,212
to pay someone, or receive cash
and then have to transport it.

545
00:31:01,212 --> 00:31:06,598
So, it's makng theft a lot less likely,
it's much more transparent,

546
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,592
and while some people
might think that's a bad thing

547
00:31:08,592 --> 00:31:11,957
because of taxes, etc.,
just take into consideration--

548
00:31:11,957 --> 00:31:17,186
getting robbed <i>once</i> can be,
first of all, physically dangerous,

549
00:31:17,186 --> 00:31:21,746
and second, a very expensive proposition,

550
00:31:21,746 --> 00:31:24,346
even if you're physically okay.

551
00:31:25,311 --> 00:31:27,548
Finally, it's faster and cheaper.

552
00:31:27,548 --> 00:31:33,070
So, overall, electronic transactions
are just much better

553
00:31:33,070 --> 00:31:34,764
for most startup companies.

554
00:31:34,764 --> 00:31:37,214
Now, let's talk for a minute or two

555
00:31:37,214 --> 00:31:39,646
about the distinction
between electronic banking

556
00:31:39,646 --> 00:31:42,542
versus electronic payments,
mobile money, etc. etc.

557
00:31:42,542 --> 00:31:45,774
So, electronic banking,
first of all, or "e-banking".

558
00:31:45,774 --> 00:31:49,883
That's just the front end of a real bank.

559
00:31:49,883 --> 00:31:53,168
In other words, it's an interface
that they give you

560
00:31:53,168 --> 00:31:56,474
so that you can bank online,
even from your phone.

561
00:31:56,474 --> 00:32:01,164
But the distinction there is that
it's actually a real bank behind it,

562
00:32:02,604 --> 00:32:05,831
following some kind of rules
for capitalization,

563
00:32:05,831 --> 00:32:09,743
there's often some kind
of deposit insurance, etc.

564
00:32:09,743 --> 00:32:14,166
So, there's banking
with a front end on it,

565
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:17,252
versus an electronic payment service--

566
00:32:17,252 --> 00:32:19,870
people also call it
an electronic money issuer

567
00:32:19,870 --> 00:32:22,877
or a cash handling organization--
so, in other words,

568
00:32:22,877 --> 00:32:25,831
these are kind of Paypal-esque 
type companies,

569
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:29,692
where they usually
will keep money for you,

570
00:32:29,692 --> 00:32:33,896
as part of the transaction,
but you do not have to--

571
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:38,007
they don't pay interest on the money,
for example,

572
00:32:38,007 --> 00:32:40,484
and they don't make loans on the money.

573
00:32:40,484 --> 00:32:44,749
So, it's not officially a bank,
it's really-- in most countries--

574
00:32:44,749 --> 00:32:48,440
it's really more
of a money handling operation

575
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,091
that happens to be electronic.

576
00:32:50,091 --> 00:32:51,793
Then there's also this third category,

577
00:32:51,793 --> 00:32:54,246
of some kind of mobile money
or stored value,

578
00:32:54,246 --> 00:32:56,046
depending on what it is.

579
00:32:58,596 --> 00:33:00,286
This is where you, more or less,

580
00:33:00,286 --> 00:33:03,761
pre-pay for some service--
let's say a telecom service,

581
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:06,379
and the telecom service
would be for your mobile phone.

582
00:33:06,379 --> 00:33:08,071
I'm going to use minutes
on my mobile phone.

583
00:33:08,071 --> 00:33:09,630
I'm going to pay
a certain amount of money,

584
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:13,382
and the mobile phone company
will store the money

585
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:18,011
for you in your account,
and then you can use that money

586
00:33:18,011 --> 00:33:21,968
to pay someone else
and receive money from someone else.

587
00:33:21,968 --> 00:33:26,298
This has opened up a whole new world
in cashless transactions,

588
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:30,893
and also opened up to non-bank customers.

589
00:33:30,893 --> 00:33:32,472
Customers who wouldn't ordinarily

590
00:33:32,472 --> 00:33:36,201
have a bank account <i>or</i> a credit card,
probably have a mobile phone.

591
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:38,457
it doesn't have to be telecom services,

592
00:33:38,457 --> 00:33:42,131
it could be any kind of stored value,
where this is possible.

593
00:33:42,131 --> 00:33:44,032
There are lots of different
experiments going on

594
00:33:44,032 --> 00:33:49,714
worldwide right now, in many different
stored value-type situations.

595
00:33:49,714 --> 00:33:52,131
But that's the basic premise
behind mobile money,

596
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:55,841
and then if you really want cash,
you can go to some place,

597
00:33:55,841 --> 00:34:01,302
a physical place,
where you can send a message

598
00:34:01,302 --> 00:34:04,065
to that party and that party 
gives you the cash

599
00:34:04,465 --> 00:34:05,760
right then and there.

600
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,667
So, it can be converted to cash,

601
00:34:07,667 --> 00:34:10,204
but it can also stay as stored value

602
00:34:10,204 --> 00:34:12,802
and then be spent as you need it.

603
00:34:12,802 --> 00:34:14,834
So, one question you have to ask

604
00:34:14,834 --> 00:34:18,630
in a peer-to-peer situation like that 
though is where does the value reside?

605
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,109
Is it on your phone,

606
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:23,991
in your phone device--
if someone steals your phone,

607
00:34:23,991 --> 00:34:25,468
do they get all your money?

608
00:34:25,468 --> 00:34:27,837
Or is it in an account
someplace in the cloud,

609
00:34:27,837 --> 00:34:30,043
where you need a certain PIN
to activate it,

610
00:34:30,043 --> 00:34:33,193
and if you lose your phone
you still get to keep all your money,

611
00:34:33,193 --> 00:34:36,054
you replace your phone
and then you have access to your account.

612
00:34:36,054 --> 00:34:37,909
So, you have to ask yourself,

613
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:39,818
when you're thinking these things through,

614
00:34:39,818 --> 00:34:41,714
where does the value reside?

615
00:34:41,714 --> 00:34:45,007
Is it in a chip on the card,
or is it in the cloud someplace?

616
00:34:45,007 --> 00:34:48,349
If it's in the cloud, then you have 
to have connectivity

617
00:34:48,349 --> 00:34:52,554
to be able to send and receive money.

618
00:34:53,493 --> 00:34:56,128
It also raises the question
about insurance.

619
00:34:56,128 --> 00:35:00,242
In many countries,
bank accounts are insured,

620
00:35:00,242 --> 00:35:03,027
which means if the bank
goes out of business,

621
00:35:03,027 --> 00:35:08,914
the government promises to pay,
usually, some maximum amount

622
00:35:08,914 --> 00:35:11,101
of all the depositers-- pay them back.

623
00:35:12,221 --> 00:35:16,207
And then the question you have to ask
in a peer-to-peer system,

624
00:35:16,207 --> 00:35:17,752
is that money insured as well?

625
00:35:17,752 --> 00:35:21,583
If not, it's okay, but you probably
don't want to put <i>everything</i>

626
00:35:22,533 --> 00:35:27,026
on a peer-to-peer
stored-value-type exchange.

627
00:35:27,094 --> 00:35:30,332
So it's a few things to think about,
here, but overall

628
00:35:30,332 --> 00:35:33,362
I would say the benefits

629
00:35:33,362 --> 00:35:37,692
of having electronic transactions

630
00:35:37,692 --> 00:35:42,885
far outweigh the disadvantages
of electronic transactions.
