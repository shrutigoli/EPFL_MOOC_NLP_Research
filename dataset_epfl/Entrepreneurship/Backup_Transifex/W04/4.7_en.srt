1
00:00:08,209 --> 00:00:10,085
(Chris Tucci) Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:10,086 --> 00:00:13,875
This is segment 4.7
which is the week's summary.

3
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:18,043
My colleague Marc Gruber
just stepped out for a few minutes.

4
00:00:18,066 --> 00:00:22,025
I think he's tweeting
some answers to some of you

5
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:23,889
with the online office hours

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,464
and/or replying on social media
to some of your questions,

7
00:00:27,465 --> 00:00:32,237
and I think he also left me here
to face the wrath of the viewers

8
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:35,098
for the excessive length of week four.

9
00:00:36,608 --> 00:00:39,616
I'm really sorry about how long
week four turned out to be.

10
00:00:39,617 --> 00:00:41,921
I didn't realize how long
it was going to be.

11
00:00:41,922 --> 00:00:45,954
There's a lot of material to cover
in terms of venture financing,

12
00:00:45,955 --> 00:00:50,293
so it ended up dragging
on for a little too long.

13
00:00:50,294 --> 00:00:53,579
So I'd like to apologize
to each and every one of you

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,550
for the length of week four.

15
00:00:55,551 --> 00:01:00,124
So will make a very quick work
of this summary right now

16
00:01:00,125 --> 00:01:02,399
just recalling
what we covered in this week.

17
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,879
The first thing we talked about
was how much money do you need,

18
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,894
and as you recall, we went
through lots of different calculations

19
00:01:10,895 --> 00:01:13,526
showing, basically,

20
00:01:13,527 --> 00:01:16,589
the full amount of money
that one would need to have;

21
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:20,419
plus we even talked
about on a year-by-year basis,

22
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,062
how much money
would you need in each year

23
00:01:23,063 --> 00:01:26,582
based on your own cost
and revenue projection,

24
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:30,024
which you should do,
and should update frequently.

25
00:01:30,854 --> 00:01:33,964
So on this graphic,
as you can see, this is the one,

26
00:01:33,965 --> 00:01:36,319
you're probably sick
of this graphic by now,

27
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,469
showing the amount of money
that one would expect to need,

28
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:45,254
and the cash flow positive point,
the breakeven point,

29
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:47,500
and the initial endowment.

30
00:01:47,501 --> 00:01:50,751
We also talked about the stages
of venture financing

31
00:01:50,752 --> 00:01:53,530
which refers to,
at different points in time,

32
00:01:53,531 --> 00:01:55,710
over which you will need to finance.

33
00:01:55,711 --> 00:02:01,515
The points on the left side of this graph
we call the seed or start-up stage,

34
00:02:01,516 --> 00:02:03,518
and the points on the right hand side,

35
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:07,790
are as time goes on, and you start selling
things and having a real product

36
00:02:07,791 --> 00:02:12,837
then you would expect to raise
some growth or expansion financing.

37
00:02:13,197 --> 00:02:15,822
So we kind of drew a distinction
between those things.

38
00:02:15,823 --> 00:02:19,863
We then went on to discuss
different types of financing.

39
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:23,902
For example, a gift,
a donation, issuing debt,

40
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:28,086
issuing equity, or sharing
part of your business,

41
00:02:28,776 --> 00:02:31,265
the ownership and control
of a part of your business,

42
00:02:31,472 --> 00:02:34,471
and we also talked briefly
about convertible debt.

43
00:02:34,472 --> 00:02:38,154
And then, we went through a list

44
00:02:38,155 --> 00:02:42,516
of all the different kinds of investors
that you might encounter,

45
00:02:42,517 --> 00:02:47,283
and we walked through some
of the pluses and minuses of each of them.

46
00:02:47,284 --> 00:02:49,999
And as you recall for each of these,

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,126
we also went through a range
of expected amounts

48
00:02:55,276 --> 00:02:58,076
and a typical amount
that you might expect to receive.

49
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:02,021
We also remembered
that this was calibrated

50
00:03:02,022 --> 00:03:05,430
towards, you know,
an industrialized economy

51
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,743
where the GDP per capita is around 50,000,

52
00:03:11,744 --> 00:03:14,743
so these would need to be re-calibrated

53
00:03:14,744 --> 00:03:19,000
depending on your own
country's GDP per capita.

54
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:21,816
But in any case, what we have here

55
00:03:21,817 --> 00:03:26,229
is a range for each source,
a typical amount for each source,

56
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:30,263
and we also draw the distinction
between more or less, the left side,

57
00:03:30,264 --> 00:03:33,298
which is really seed
and startup financing,

58
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:36,400
and the right-hand side,
lower right corner,

59
00:03:36,401 --> 00:03:39,531
which is really for expansion and growth.

60
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:42,862
And then for each source,

61
00:03:42,863 --> 00:03:46,592
we analyzed some of the pluses
and minuses of each source

62
00:03:46,593 --> 00:03:48,991
based on three primary criteria.

63
00:03:48,992 --> 00:03:52,941
The first one being financial:
How much money can you raise?

64
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:55,789
What is the availability,
time horizon, cost etc.?

65
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:59,125
The management criteria,
which is the support they can give you

66
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:03,110
in the founding process, on management,
or reputation value they can add;

67
00:04:03,111 --> 00:04:04,450
or further criteria,

68
00:04:04,451 --> 00:04:09,730
which is how independent the source
from you or your founding team.

69
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:11,750
So I think I hear Marc coming in now.

70
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:13,680
I think he's going to join me
on this next bit,

71
00:04:13,681 --> 00:04:15,569
and we're going to finish out

72
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:17,447
the rest of this week's summary.

73
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:20,985
OK, so what we've done
now with this, if you recall,

74
00:04:20,986 --> 00:04:25,247
is we mapped those criteria onto
the different sources of financing.

75
00:04:25,248 --> 00:04:27,515
(Marc Gruber) This is
a quite helpful overview

76
00:04:27,516 --> 00:04:31,059
because it tells you about the timing,
about the money you can expect, etc.

77
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:34,439
We don't want to go into the details
of the slide because we discussed them.

78
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,628
We already did it. (laughter)

79
00:04:35,629 --> 00:04:36,948
This is just the summary,

80
00:04:36,949 --> 00:04:40,511
but I think it's worthwhile keeping this
in mind, and you can print it out,

81
00:04:40,512 --> 00:04:44,033
and have it as a reference tool
further on, and we had another slide--

82
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:46,489
Same thing for the expansion financing.

83
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,039
So what we have here the summary

84
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:53,317
and how the expansion financing maps
onto the different decision criteria.

85
00:04:54,287 --> 00:04:58,519
One of the most recent forms of funding
that is quite attractive to entrepreneurs

86
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,043
is crowdfunding
because it is happening on the web,

87
00:05:01,044 --> 00:05:04,486
and you can get an audience that
is international to fund your venture.

88
00:05:04,487 --> 00:05:05,487
Right.

89
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:07,506
So what we talked about this week was

90
00:05:07,507 --> 00:05:10,720
some of the financial aspects
of crowdfunding.

91
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:14,873
So as we noted, it could be
a great source of seed funding.

92
00:05:14,874 --> 00:05:18,458
Generally speaking, backers
don't get equity,

93
00:05:18,459 --> 00:05:21,488
although we did discuss
in the segment itself

94
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:23,203
when they do get equity,

95
00:05:23,204 --> 00:05:26,745
and how different countries are shifting
the rules toward equity financing.

96
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:33,709
You can use the funds to execute
your project according to your plan.

97
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:37,372
But you're obliged also to do that,
because you're collecting the money.

98
00:05:37,373 --> 00:05:41,298
People expect something of you,
and you better should follow up

99
00:05:41,299 --> 00:05:44,012
because otherwise there could be
all kinds of legal problems

100
00:05:44,013 --> 00:05:45,832
if you do not keep your promise.

101
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,682
Actually, It's even worse
for your reputation

102
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:48,998
if you don't keep your promise.

103
00:05:48,999 --> 00:05:50,668
-Exactly.
-That's for sure.

104
00:05:50,669 --> 00:05:53,608
We also talked about
the types of funding schemes,

105
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:56,414
and here we can differentiate
between the fixed ones

106
00:05:56,417 --> 00:05:59,241
where you basically make a plan
to raise X amount,

107
00:05:59,242 --> 00:06:02,133
and you have to raise at least X
or you don't get anything,

108
00:06:02,134 --> 00:06:05,464
or the flexible ones where you get
to keep as much as you raise

109
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,002
up until whatever point that you stop,

110
00:06:08,003 --> 00:06:10,142
and some of the pluses
and minuses of that.

111
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:13,666
So the final element we discussed
this week with you is the burn rate.

112
00:06:13,667 --> 00:06:17,159
It's the cash management
because as we've said,

113
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,125
the cash in your company is the air
that you breathe, like a human being,

114
00:06:21,126 --> 00:06:24,227
and if you do not have the air
you breathe, you suffocate.

115
00:06:24,228 --> 00:06:27,500
And as you do not have cash
in a company, you go bankrupt.

116
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:30,397
So, in essence, managing
your cash is highly important,

117
00:06:30,398 --> 00:06:33,166
and there were three points
in particular that you pointed out.

118
00:06:33,167 --> 00:06:36,692
These are just time to out of cash.
How to calculate that.

119
00:06:36,693 --> 00:06:39,071
We went through that,
and that gives you some idea

120
00:06:39,083 --> 00:06:41,917
about how long you can
continue the status quo.

121
00:06:42,667 --> 00:06:45,576
It also helps you plan your fundraising

122
00:06:45,577 --> 00:06:48,062
because you need to know
when you need to raise money,

123
00:06:48,063 --> 00:06:50,948
and you need to know the terms
that you're going to raise the money on.

124
00:06:50,949 --> 00:06:53,308
And finally, your burn rate
also points out

125
00:06:53,309 --> 00:06:55,463
potential weaknesses
in your revenue model

126
00:06:55,464 --> 00:06:59,292
to make sure that you need to have
recurring revenues if possible

127
00:06:59,293 --> 00:07:01,639
rather than simply one off revenues.

128
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,147
So in a way, it makes you think

129
00:07:03,148 --> 00:07:04,867
about what you planned
as a revenue model,

130
00:07:04,868 --> 00:07:06,815
and that there
might be better ways out there.

131
00:07:06,816 --> 00:07:09,640
And it comes back to the discussion
about the entrepreneurial mindset

132
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:10,818
that we already have

133
00:07:10,819 --> 00:07:13,678
because the good entrepreneurs
are good at looking at the venture

134
00:07:13,679 --> 00:07:14,978
from multiple aspects,

135
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:17,762
and being flexible, and trying
to understand different ways

136
00:07:17,763 --> 00:07:20,611
of, in that case,
constructing a revenue model

137
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:23,454
which might be superior to the one
you're currently thinking of.

138
00:07:23,455 --> 00:07:27,474
Were going to talk more about that
next week in module five as well.

139
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:30,089
So this brings us to the end
of week four already.

140
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:32,389
I know month has gone by.
Time moves quickly.

141
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:34,488
Time moves quickly, we're having fun.

142
00:07:34,489 --> 00:07:39,252
But this is four fifths; 80%
of the MOOC done, there's one week to go.

143
00:07:39,253 --> 00:07:41,843
That'll be the week
on value capture and growth,

144
00:07:41,844 --> 00:07:44,769
and actually we will take
up some of these topics

145
00:07:44,770 --> 00:07:46,838
of modifying your business
model a little bit.

146
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,957
Growing, plans with growing, etc.,

147
00:07:48,958 --> 00:07:51,897
so we look forward to that
and stay with us.

148
00:07:51,898 --> 00:07:53,790
Till next week, stay tuned.
