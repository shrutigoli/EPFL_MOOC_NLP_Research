4
00:00:34,557 --> 00:00:38,166
Welcome to week four,
raising and managing money

5
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,890
>> And just to recap what we did so

6
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,520
far we're already in week 4,
the course has only 5 weeks so

7
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,470
remember this, so we're almost done.

8
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:49,840
But in week 2,
we talked about opportunities,

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,150
how you identify multiple opportunities,
base your.

10
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:55,650
On your technology, remember that
term technological fungibility.

11
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:56,760
It sounds fancy but

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,160
it actually means that you can apply
your technology to multiple customers.

13
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,150
We talked about evaluation
of opportunities and

14
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,330
developing a road Enough to exploit here,
multiple opportunities over time.

15
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,080
>> Right.
Then in last week, week 3,

16
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,280
we talked a lot about
entrepreneurial marketing.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,910
We helped think about
developing a marketing plan.

18
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,125
We wanted to know who your customers are,
what your value proposition is, and

19
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,412
we talked about gorilla marketing.

20
00:01:22,412 --> 00:01:24,635
>> Which is actually quite
an exciting form of marketing.

21
00:01:24,635 --> 00:01:26,295
It's a more operational site.

22
00:01:26,295 --> 00:01:28,355
It should be aligned with
your overall strategy.

23
00:01:28,355 --> 00:01:31,635
But they're the underlying logic
was that you actually said I

24
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:33,375
have to smart because I do not have so

25
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:36,560
many funds like the larger corporations
to run my marketing company.

26
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,460
>> Perfect!
So let's look and

27
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:40,460
see what we're going to
cover in the next week.

28
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:44,640
So, as Mark just said, you may be running
a gorilla marketing campaign, a very lean

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,700
operation, but it's still going to cost
you to get your company off the ground.

30
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:54,710
So in the first part of this week we're
going to study how much money do you need?

31
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:57,910
That's going to involve making
some financial projections for

32
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:59,520
the next few years and

33
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:05,370
trying to understand how much cash you're
spending and how much you're bringing in,

34
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:09,670
and therefore what your overall financing
needs are to get your company launched.

35
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,440
>> So in addition to doing the financial
projections, you also have to know which

36
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,890
type of financing is available from whom
you could get the money that you need.

37
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:21,580
And also in terms in type of financing,
you'll think about debt financing.

38
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,860
You might even get gifts.

39
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:25,460
You might get equity financing.

40
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,270
There might be convertible debt.

41
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:29,970
This might sound technical to some,
but we're going to walk you

42
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,820
in detail through each of these
types of financing in segment 4.2.

43
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:35,450
>> In addition we look at
the types of investors.

44
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:39,200
Right, so there would be a big
laundry list here of investors.

45
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,336
>> Which is good news because-
>> Good.

46
00:02:40,336 --> 00:02:41,610
[LAUGH]
>> People who have money and

47
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:42,380
want to invest.

48
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:44,530
>> Sources for you, so

49
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:49,790
what we'll do is we'll just walk through
the big picture of the types of investors.

50
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,288
And then we'll break it out by
stage which we discuss right now.

51
00:02:53,288 --> 00:02:58,870
So in 4.3, we'll focus on the early stages
of your company before you're making

52
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:02,380
any money and you're really launching
a company getting it off the ground.

53
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:05,820
So, what kinds of investors are going
to be the most appropriate for

54
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,030
those early stages?

55
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:10,570
>> It could be your friends and
your family because they believe in you.

56
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,550
They want to support you.

57
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,800
There could also be
crowdfunding campaigns and

58
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:18,520
that's quite an important element,
especially in this MOOC today.

59
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,490
It could be also startup competitions.

60
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,326
It could be angel investors and all these
stage venture capitalists at some points.

61
00:03:24,326 --> 00:03:29,690
>> So in 4.4, we'll focus more on
the later stages of the venture process,

62
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,010
when you've already got a process, when
maybe you've already got some sales and

63
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,940
you're and
you're basically growing the company.

64
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,510
Then we have the expansion financing.

65
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:41,460
And there's a whole new set
of actors that are available

66
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,130
to help finance your venture.

67
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,740
>> So think about family offices,
think about banks, et cetera, et cetera.

68
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:51,360
because these are actors that want to
see that you have a proof of technology,

69
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,290
a proof of market that there are customers
out there willing to pay for

70
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:56,630
your products, and

71
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,750
that your technology actually works, and
does the things you promised it does.

72
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:06,110
Because then a lot of risk is taken off
the table for these types of investors.

73
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:09,840
And that means these investors would be
looking at companies that have different

74
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,370
risk profiles and the investors that we
just discussed in the previous slides

75
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:19,730
which would be more investors that look at
early stage companies and are ready there,

76
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:25,060
available to actually invest in companies
that are less mature and have more risk.

77
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:26,410
>> Right.
So what we'll do is for

78
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,480
all of these we'll walk through how
much money you'd expect to raise,

79
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:34,610
what the time horizon is, and
lots of different aspects or

80
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:38,240
psychological aspects of working
with different types of investors.

81
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:40,210
>> Exactly.
The bottom line is that we want to give

82
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:43,360
you a very good understanding of
the funding universe that is out there.

83
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,580
Because without the funds of other people,

84
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:48,510
you probably will not get far
with your technology venture.

85
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:52,730
So one important way of getting
funding nowadays is crowdfunding.

86
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,810
You remember that from
the marketing module?

87
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:56,470
We introduced you to this concept.

88
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:59,210
Because it has important
marketing elements to it.

89
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,170
It helps you in launching your product,

90
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:04,550
it helps you in getting visibility with
your company, but that's one aspect.

91
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,120
It has also a very important
financial aspect to it.

92
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:12,080
>> That's right, I mean, entrepreneurs
now, can via Internet platforms,

93
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,520
reach out to investors who happen
to be all over the whole world.

94
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,390
So, what we'll do in
this particular segment

95
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:22,220
is we'll walk through how that works.

96
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:25,960
We'll talk a little bit about some of
the legal financial implications of having

97
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,760
lots of investors all over the world.

98
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:30,610
And how you can expect to
raise money from them,

99
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:34,490
going into details about how some
of the crowdfunding platforms work.

100
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:38,120
>> Exactly and I think that a wonderful
opportunity for each and every one of you

101
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,640
to get your venture off the ground and to
make your first steps as an entrepreneur.

102
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,620
So these crowd funding campaigns give
you access to potential investors

103
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,330
across the globe.

104
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:50,500
But never forget that actually
you need to manage your cash.

105
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:54,360
Because this is more like an operational
issue but it's highly important.

106
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,650
It's like the air that you breathe.

107
00:05:56,650 --> 00:05:57,990
Cash is the air that you breathe.

108
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,780
Because if you run out of cash it's like
running out of air that you breathe.

109
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,760
What happens when you run
out of air when you breathe?

110
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,120
You fall over and you die.

111
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,700
This will happen to your company.

112
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,130
You will just go bankrupt.

113
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:12,640
So managing your cash is
our focus in module 4.6,

114
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:16,330
and this has a couple of other
issues that are related to it.

115
00:06:16,330 --> 00:06:18,710
>> I mean we'll talk a little
bit about the burn rate, so

116
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:22,310
how much you're spending
relative to how much you have.

117
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,740
We'll talk about having bank accounts.

118
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:27,540
How to look for a bank,
keeping your accounts separate.

119
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:31,740
We'll talk a little bit about shrinkage,
or employees stealing from you, or

120
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:34,400
you stealing from yourself
by mixing your funds.

121
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,740
And we'll go through a lot of
details on how to manage your cash.

122
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,610
>> And conserve your air in that way.

123
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,110
>> Right.

124
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,080
Conserving your air.

125
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,870
>> [LAUGH] Conserving your air.
>> So, that's what's in your future for

126
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:48,170
week four in raising and managing money.

127
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,200
Don't go away.

128
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:49,770
>> Stay tuned.
