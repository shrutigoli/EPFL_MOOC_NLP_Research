1
00:00:07,959 --> 00:00:11,001
OK! Welcome back, Segment 4.3.

2
00:00:12,475 --> 00:00:14,445
In this little segment,

3
00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:17,376
we're going to talk about seed
and startup financing.

4
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:20,490
That's the amount of money
that you need

5
00:00:20,491 --> 00:00:23,120
when you are first getting
your business launched.

6
00:00:23,777 --> 00:00:26,262
Some people make a distinction
between the seed phase,

7
00:00:26,263 --> 00:00:28,270
which is the really, really,
really early stage

8
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:30,995
when you're just looking
for your first financing,

9
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:32,759
and the startup phase,

10
00:00:33,179 --> 00:00:36,232
which is just after the seed phase.

11
00:00:36,959 --> 00:00:40,982
In general, they usually involve
the same sources of financing,

12
00:00:40,983 --> 00:00:42,195
same pluses and minuses.

13
00:00:42,196 --> 00:00:44,315
We're going to put them all together,

14
00:00:44,316 --> 00:00:47,797
and in many cases, people use them
interchangeably in any case.

15
00:00:48,817 --> 00:00:54,146
The seed and the startup financing
is the plan for today.

16
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:57,034
By now, you'll should be almost sick
of our little graphic

17
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:59,604
that shows the different timeline

18
00:00:59,605 --> 00:01:03,262
and the cash flow on a business,

19
00:01:03,263 --> 00:01:05,990
but let's just review it really quickly

20
00:01:05,991 --> 00:01:09,636
so we can discuss
the various stages of the company.

21
00:01:09,751 --> 00:01:13,960
First, we have the X axis
which just refers to the past of time.

22
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:18,960
Then we have the Y axis
which is the total amount of money,

23
00:01:19,593 --> 00:01:22,916
either positive, which means
you have money in the bank,

24
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:26,657
or negative, which means
you are in deficit or you owe money.

25
00:01:31,487 --> 00:01:36,492
Then we have our famous graph
that shows how you spend down

26
00:01:36,493 --> 00:01:39,299
your initial endowment, if you have any.

27
00:01:39,925 --> 00:01:44,277
Then you start spending
more and more money until finally,

28
00:01:44,278 --> 00:01:46,841
you start earning money.

29
00:01:46,842 --> 00:01:52,497
In which case, where you have
your own resources

30
00:01:52,524 --> 00:01:53,600
that you have available.

31
00:01:53,601 --> 00:01:58,351
This part in the middle is the part
that you need to cover eventually

32
00:01:58,352 --> 00:02:00,007
through all of your financing,

33
00:02:00,008 --> 00:02:03,802
because it's the total amount of money
that you'll be spending on your business.

34
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:08,792
Then finally, once you break even,
you recoup all of your prior investments,

35
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:11,002
then you are making money again.

36
00:02:11,326 --> 00:02:14,197
Now, let's talk about
the different stages of financing here.

37
00:02:14,722 --> 00:02:16,989
As we've previously discussed,

38
00:02:17,717 --> 00:02:20,620
you can break these into different stages.

39
00:02:23,472 --> 00:02:27,280
There's no hard and fast rule
for when these stages occur.

40
00:02:27,657 --> 00:02:29,796
Let's just say that a lot of people

41
00:02:29,797 --> 00:02:34,407
would tend to call this
very early part the <i>seed stage</i>.

42
00:02:35,511 --> 00:02:38,659
Then they would call the next part
the <i>start up phase</i>.

43
00:02:42,726 --> 00:02:46,604
Then they would call the third part
the <i>expansion phase</i>

44
00:02:49,257 --> 00:02:50,940
or the growth phase.

45
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:53,228
What we're looking at today is

46
00:02:53,229 --> 00:02:57,092
this early time period

47
00:02:59,465 --> 00:03:04,083
somewhere in here

48
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:09,330
when you are trying to get
your business launched.

49
00:03:09,873 --> 00:03:11,940
Here's our big list of investors.

50
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:18,233
We've already visited this
in the last segment.

51
00:03:18,868 --> 00:03:22,999
We're going to focus now
on the top of this list

52
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:26,529
so friends and family,
crowd funding, banks,

53
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,388
foundations, startup competitions,

54
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:33,220
and individual angels,
and boot strapping, of course.

55
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:35,728
That's what we're going to talk about now.

56
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:37,751
As you recall from the last segment,

57
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:41,006
we made a list

58
00:03:41,007 --> 00:03:43,378
of each of the sources

59
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:47,069
and roughly the range
that you could expect

60
00:03:48,399 --> 00:03:49,816
of financing available

61
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:52,755
which again should be calibrated
to your own economy.

62
00:03:53,586 --> 00:03:56,990
For example, this middle
of the range here is a 100,000

63
00:03:57,757 --> 00:03:59,498
which in many industrialized countries,

64
00:03:59,499 --> 00:04:04,095
represents approximately
two times the per capita GDP.

65
00:04:04,096 --> 00:04:06,893
Now, if you're in a country
with a much higher GDP,

66
00:04:06,894 --> 00:04:08,957
then you could expect
to raise more than that.

67
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:11,502
If you're in a country
with a lower GDP per capita,

68
00:04:11,503 --> 00:04:13,729
then you would expect
to raise less than that.

69
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:16,958
It would still be roughly in that line

70
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:19,838
so you might be able to get a loan,

71
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,253
a bank loan for roughly
that amount of money,

72
00:04:22,254 --> 00:04:24,698
and you may be able to raise
that amount of money

73
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,635
from your friends and family,
for example.

74
00:04:26,636 --> 00:04:29,227
Startup competition may be half that.

75
00:04:30,108 --> 00:04:31,780
Let's talk about each of these now

76
00:04:31,781 --> 00:04:37,986
and discuss what are some of the pluses
and minuses of each of these things.

77
00:04:37,987 --> 00:04:39,609
First, we need to think about

78
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:42,565
how are we going to evaluate
all these various options that we have.

79
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:45,093
Seems like there are
so many things that we could do.

80
00:04:45,094 --> 00:04:49,240
So we need to be able to set
some criteria up to the side

81
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:50,941
between these various options.

82
00:04:51,717 --> 00:04:53,776
Let's talk about
how to analyze your options.

83
00:04:53,777 --> 00:04:55,544
When we look in all these various sources,

84
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:58,789
we need to ask ourselves
three main questions.

85
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:04,716
First is: what are the financial benefits
and cost of this?

86
00:05:04,717 --> 00:05:07,240
What are the management
costs and benefits?

87
00:05:07,241 --> 00:05:11,477
What are the other
intangible benefits and costs here?

88
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:13,779
We're going to look
at each of these in turn,

89
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,868
and we're going to talk about each source

90
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:19,251
and think about these different criteria

91
00:05:19,252 --> 00:05:20,911
for evaluating the source.

92
00:05:20,912 --> 00:05:23,708
In terms of the financial criteria,
the first question is:

93
00:05:23,709 --> 00:05:25,875
how much money can you raise?

94
00:05:25,876 --> 00:05:29,650
Obviously, you may need
more or less money

95
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:31,536
to run the operations of your business.

96
00:05:31,537 --> 00:05:34,865
It might take more or less time.

97
00:05:34,866 --> 00:05:37,669
That's why we say how quickly
are these things available.

98
00:05:38,703 --> 00:05:41,270
Then the time horizon on them.

99
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:46,042
How soon do you need
to pay back the investor

100
00:05:46,043 --> 00:05:49,900
or allow the investor
to exit the business?

101
00:05:49,901 --> 00:05:53,992
Finally, are there actual costs

102
00:05:54,013 --> 00:05:57,260
to the source of financing?

103
00:05:58,238 --> 00:06:00,864
Then we look at the management criteria.

104
00:06:01,795 --> 00:06:03,387
For the management criteria,

105
00:06:03,388 --> 00:06:08,818
what we're looking for here is:
can we get advice from the investor?

106
00:06:08,819 --> 00:06:09,923
Yes or no.

107
00:06:09,924 --> 00:06:12,490
It's not always going to be the case
that you get advice,

108
00:06:12,491 --> 00:06:16,370
but you might need help
in the founding process itself.

109
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:21,719
The really early stages,
it might be nice to get some advice

110
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,062
about what to do
and how to set up the business.

111
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:28,515
Then the second point is:
can you get advice or support

112
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:30,767
in the ongoing management
of the business

113
00:06:30,768 --> 00:06:32,620
once it's been established?

114
00:06:32,621 --> 00:06:34,425
Then the third one might be

115
00:06:34,426 --> 00:06:37,355
"What are sort of added value
does the investor have?"

116
00:06:38,334 --> 00:06:40,684
Does an affiliation with the investor

117
00:06:41,196 --> 00:06:44,489
give you a boost to your own reputation

118
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:47,862
because of your affiliation
with this prominent investor?

119
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:52,954
Then finally, the last criteria
are the intangible criteria,

120
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,894
independence versus control the business.

121
00:06:56,322 --> 00:06:58,059
Some of the sources,

122
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:03,888
especially when you are selling
equity in your business,

123
00:07:04,004 --> 00:07:07,083
then you are necessarily going to give up

124
00:07:07,084 --> 00:07:08,789
a little bit of your independence.

125
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,757
You're going to give up a little
of control over your business.

126
00:07:12,401 --> 00:07:15,512
You have to ask yourself
how much is that worth to you

127
00:07:15,822 --> 00:07:19,616
to be completely independent
versus to be partially independent.

128
00:07:19,810 --> 00:07:22,215
You're giving up a little bit of control.

129
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:26,043
That'll become more apparent later
on when we talk about expansion financing.

130
00:07:26,044 --> 00:07:28,736
Even now, even in the seed-startup stage,

131
00:07:28,737 --> 00:07:31,529
the independence issue
is an important issue.

132
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:34,142
Then finally,
just the degree of separation

133
00:07:34,143 --> 00:07:35,721
between a source and a team.

134
00:07:35,722 --> 00:07:40,180
In other words,
the source of the investment

135
00:07:40,181 --> 00:07:44,385
might be to a lesser or greater extent

136
00:07:46,102 --> 00:07:49,436
associated with the founder
and the founding team.

137
00:07:49,597 --> 00:07:54,053
You might be close with them,
which can be complicated

138
00:07:54,054 --> 00:07:56,226
as we're going to find out in a minute.

139
00:07:56,999 --> 00:07:58,531
Let's start with boot strapping.

140
00:07:59,313 --> 00:08:02,981
Boot strapping is when you finance
the company's growth

141
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:07,912
from the money that you gained
in operating the company.

142
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:14,529
As you can see, the range
that you can raise this way

143
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:16,413
is unlimited so that sounds great.

144
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:21,323
Furthermore, you keep
complete control over the company,

145
00:08:21,324 --> 00:08:24,569
and you don't have to share
the decision making rights with anybody.

146
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:29,388
However, boot strapping
has a huge disadvantage,

147
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:33,422
which is you must be running
a profitable business now.

148
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:35,760
If you're losing money,
obviously, your business

149
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,557
is not going to be throwing off
the cash that you need

150
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:40,525
to actually grow your business.

151
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:44,803
You actually have
to have a positive cash flow

152
00:08:44,804 --> 00:08:48,493
from the very moment that you decide
you want to use this as a source.

153
00:08:49,476 --> 00:08:53,755
Of course, you also don't get any advice
or input from anyone else

154
00:08:53,756 --> 00:08:56,066
because you're basically
just running your company.

155
00:08:56,067 --> 00:08:58,177
OK, let's talk about friends
and family now.

156
00:08:58,928 --> 00:09:04,588
This is where you ask your Aunt Matilda
or your grandmother,

157
00:09:04,589 --> 00:09:08,595
or any of your friends,
or other loved ones,

158
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:10,636
or anyone else that you can think of

159
00:09:10,637 --> 00:09:13,673
to basically give you a gift,
to give you money.

160
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,213
If you can't get them to give you money,

161
00:09:17,214 --> 00:09:19,813
maybe you could get them to lend you money

162
00:09:19,814 --> 00:09:23,234
at a very reasonable interest rate
so some kind of below market,

163
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:26,437
cheap loan interest rate.

164
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:33,273
This is the most typical
source of financing for a new company.

165
00:09:33,707 --> 00:09:37,790
This is possibly the easiest

166
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:40,551
depending on your relations
with your relatives.

167
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:47,058
The amount that you can raise
is up to 250,000

168
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:51,123
or five times GDP per capita
depending on your economy.

169
00:09:51,124 --> 00:09:52,861
A typical amount would be,

170
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:58,734
say, 25,000 or one half per capita GDP.

171
00:10:00,564 --> 00:10:01,883
It's quick.

172
00:10:02,266 --> 00:10:05,036
Can be done in a week or two.

173
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:08,210
A time horizon is long
because most of your friends and family

174
00:10:08,211 --> 00:10:12,099
aren't going to ask you
to pay them back immediately.

175
00:10:14,645 --> 00:10:17,362
And you get to keep control
of your business.

176
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:19,553
You're not sharing decision with anybody.

177
00:10:19,554 --> 00:10:23,034
You maintain the ownership
of your company.

178
00:10:25,187 --> 00:10:26,838
That sounds ideal, doesn't it?

179
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:30,155
The problem is that there's actually
several disadvantages to this,

180
00:10:30,156 --> 00:10:35,214
which is first of all,
the amounts are on the smaller side.

181
00:10:35,215 --> 00:10:39,814
You're not going to be able to go very far
with the friends and family investment.

182
00:10:44,429 --> 00:10:48,020
Plus, a failure can hurt
your personal relations, right?

183
00:10:49,923 --> 00:10:54,264
You go to see on a holiday dinner
with your Aunt Matilda.

184
00:10:54,265 --> 00:10:56,419
You've already asked her
for her life savings,

185
00:10:57,026 --> 00:10:58,400
which she's given to you.

186
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:00,621
Then she says, “Gee, I couldn't go.

187
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:04,028
I had to sell my house
and move into my apartment

188
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:05,154
because I gave you all my money.

189
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:06,787
So, how's your business going?

190
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,244
It puts a lot of pressure on you.

191
00:11:09,245 --> 00:11:12,885
If you turn around and say,
"Yeah, sorry, my business didn't work out.

192
00:11:13,443 --> 00:11:15,118
Hope you enjoy your new apartment."

193
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:21,231
You're basically putting
your personal relations,

194
00:11:21,232 --> 00:11:23,053
You're kind of stretching them here:

195
00:11:23,054 --> 00:11:26,187
if you're not successful
with your company.

196
00:11:26,188 --> 00:11:28,478
There's not a huge separation

197
00:11:28,479 --> 00:11:31,328
between the source
and the founding team.

198
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:35,516
Usually, if you're asking
your grandmother for money

199
00:11:35,517 --> 00:11:38,407
or maybe your grandmother
is a very successful entrepreneur

200
00:11:38,408 --> 00:11:39,796
so that's great.

201
00:11:39,797 --> 00:11:45,143
She might be able to give you advice
about how to grow your business.

202
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:48,882
But most of the time, your friends
and family members

203
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:51,818
are not going to be able
to advise you on the business.

204
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:53,429
So, as you can see,

205
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:59,234
there are some very serious disadvantages
to friends and family,

206
00:11:59,235 --> 00:12:01,327
along with many, many advantages.

207
00:12:01,328 --> 00:12:04,748
Now, we've already had
a prior session in a prior module

208
00:12:04,749 --> 00:12:08,546
on crowd funding,
on the mechanics of setting up

209
00:12:08,547 --> 00:12:12,787
a crowd funding proposal on a platform.

210
00:12:13,798 --> 00:12:16,297
But what we want to do
in this particular segment

211
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:18,245
is understand the plus and minuses

212
00:12:18,246 --> 00:12:20,591
of getting crowd funding money
in the first place.

213
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,499
As you recall,

214
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:27,249
it's when you go on an Internet platform

215
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:31,155
and you basically ask
an anonymous crowd for money.

216
00:12:32,601 --> 00:12:34,847
In most case, it's a gift,

217
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:39,558
but it could also be you
pre-selling your inventory,

218
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:41,523
you're pre-selling your prototypes

219
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:43,758
occasionally, depending on the country.

220
00:12:43,759 --> 00:12:46,519
There's different rules
about ownership of companies.

221
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,265
How many people can possibly
be investors at the same time

222
00:12:51,266 --> 00:12:53,134
before you need to be a public company?

223
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:57,848
But occasionally,
you will actually sell equity stakes

224
00:12:57,849 --> 00:12:59,546
to your crowd funding investors.

225
00:13:01,401 --> 00:13:04,972
The amount is usually
on the order of a thousand

226
00:13:04,973 --> 00:13:08,996
to a hundred thousand,
say, two times GDP per capita,

227
00:13:09,113 --> 00:13:14,633
but the typical amount is really very,
very small on the order of 7,000.

228
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:19,212
Of course, companies have raised millions

229
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:20,888
in certain crowd funding campaigns.

230
00:13:21,576 --> 00:13:24,197
But those are relatively rare events.

231
00:13:24,198 --> 00:13:28,026
Usually, there was involved something
that's almost really ready to go

232
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:29,098
a production -

233
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:32,133
that they're really pre-selling
inventory on those cases.

234
00:13:32,751 --> 00:13:35,351
A timeframe here
is about one to two months.

235
00:13:35,352 --> 00:13:37,984
The time horizon on all these things
is relatively long,

236
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:41,754
except in the case
of pre-selling a prototype.

237
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:43,691
We'll talk about that in a minute.

238
00:13:43,692 --> 00:13:47,042
It can be relatively short

239
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:49,869
for receiving a product in your hand.

240
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,444
On the other hand, if it's a gift
or if it's an equity investment,

241
00:13:52,445 --> 00:13:54,556
they aren't long timeframe here.

242
00:13:54,563 --> 00:13:56,245
They're not looking to get repaid.

243
00:13:56,246 --> 00:14:00,332
They're not looking
for an exit event in the near future.

244
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:02,197
What are the advantages here?

245
00:14:02,198 --> 00:14:07,282
The advantages, you maintain control
of your company, which is very nice.

246
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:10,861
It gives you the possibility
of testing the market.

247
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:12,760
You have a concept.

248
00:14:12,761 --> 00:14:13,692
You have a prototype.

249
00:14:13,693 --> 00:14:16,490
You're not sure if people
would be interested in it.

250
00:14:16,491 --> 00:14:19,411
Here's a chance for you
to actually put it out there

251
00:14:19,412 --> 00:14:23,143
and get feedback on it and see
if people are willing to pay for it.

252
00:14:23,144 --> 00:14:26,771
Because in many cases,
they will actually pre-buy your prototype

253
00:14:26,772 --> 00:14:28,489
before you put it into production.

254
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:31,487
The third advantage is
you get a big audience.

255
00:14:31,507 --> 00:14:35,555
You get a lot of people noticing you,
learning about your company,

256
00:14:35,556 --> 00:14:39,464
learning about your concept,
and possibly helping you.

257
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:42,031
Those are some very, very good advantages

258
00:14:42,032 --> 00:14:43,689
to crowd funding platforms.

259
00:14:43,937 --> 00:14:46,262
Now, the disadvantages,
the first one is – of course,

260
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:49,434
you already mentioned it –
it's a relatively small amount of money.

261
00:14:49,614 --> 00:14:53,308
Don't plan on using
crowd funding campaign

262
00:14:53,309 --> 00:14:56,253
to this giant launch
to cover all of your cost.

263
00:14:56,254 --> 00:14:59,519
It's going to get you
some feedback relatively early.

264
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,693
It's going to get you a relatively
small amount of money

265
00:15:01,694 --> 00:15:06,995
to kind of keep you going through
the next few months type of thing.

266
00:15:08,095 --> 00:15:10,154
If you don't execute,

267
00:15:10,709 --> 00:15:15,254
you can expect a major
public relation problem

268
00:15:15,504 --> 00:15:18,444
because now, you've advertised
to people on the Internet.

269
00:15:19,244 --> 00:15:21,542
If you don't do what you say
you're going to do,

270
00:15:21,543 --> 00:15:24,244
then they're going to be complaining
about you on the Internet.

271
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:27,320
It's going to really hurt your reputation.

272
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:30,928
There've been lots of stories
of people who presold inventory.

273
00:15:30,929 --> 00:15:33,253
They didn't realize there's going to be
some customs issues

274
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:35,118
when they shipped it out
of their own country.

275
00:15:35,119 --> 00:15:38,513
Then the people didn't receive it on time
and started complaining,

276
00:15:38,514 --> 00:15:40,821
or they had to pay extra customs fees.

277
00:15:40,822 --> 00:15:42,712
Then they really, really were complaining.

278
00:15:42,713 --> 00:15:45,771
If you don't ship on time
when you say you're going to,

279
00:15:45,772 --> 00:15:48,253
people don't forgive
the production delays.

280
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:51,913
They'll definitely come down
and start saying bad things about you,

281
00:15:51,914 --> 00:15:54,069
and that's going to hurt
the reputation of your company.

282
00:15:54,146 --> 00:15:55,493
There's a risk here.

283
00:15:55,501 --> 00:15:56,751
There's a reputational risk.

284
00:15:56,752 --> 00:16:00,497
You have to be really, really ready
and confident you can execute.

285
00:16:00,498 --> 00:16:05,093
Usually, the people making the investments
in the crowd funding platform

286
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:06,673
are not going to give you advice.

287
00:16:06,786 --> 00:16:10,689
So you're not going to learn
about founding your company,

288
00:16:10,709 --> 00:16:14,501
how to take it to the next level,
et cetera, from any of these investors.

289
00:16:14,502 --> 00:16:17,705
They're most anonymous crowd of investors

290
00:16:17,706 --> 00:16:20,673
that are basically giving you
some resources you can work with.

291
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:22,890
Okay, let's talk about banks now.

292
00:16:24,848 --> 00:16:30,023
Banks is where you go
where you want to take out a loan.

293
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:35,675
The bank lends you money,
usually small amounts of money

294
00:16:36,408 --> 00:16:38,427
on the order of a thousand.

295
00:16:38,428 --> 00:16:43,048
Of course, you can get up to 500,000
maybe or ten times GDP per capita,

296
00:16:43,449 --> 00:16:45,974
but your typical amount
is going to be much lower than that,

297
00:16:45,975 --> 00:16:50,370
more on the order of 25,000
or one-half GDP per capita.

298
00:16:51,783 --> 00:16:55,781
It takes about one to two months

299
00:16:55,782 --> 00:16:57,779
to get a loan

300
00:16:57,780 --> 00:17:00,651
because the bank has to do all kinds
of due diligence on you.

301
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:03,700
They also want to make sure
that you're going to pay them back

302
00:17:03,991 --> 00:17:07,871
or that you are going to put up
something as collateral.

303
00:17:08,471 --> 00:17:13,012
The time horizon on a bank loan
is usually relatively short term

304
00:17:13,013 --> 00:17:16,355
so talking about maybe five years or so.

305
00:17:16,972 --> 00:17:21,064
The bank is going to be expected
to get an interest payment

306
00:17:21,065 --> 00:17:25,425
during the whole term on the loan
and either amortize the loan.

307
00:17:26,028 --> 00:17:31,693
In other words, you start paying
the principle down during the loan period

308
00:17:31,694 --> 00:17:34,857
or pay interest only
and then pay back the whole loan

309
00:17:34,858 --> 00:17:36,079
at the end of the term.

310
00:17:36,445 --> 00:17:38,006
You're on the hook,

311
00:17:38,007 --> 00:17:41,597
and the bank's time horizon
is generally relatively on a shorter side.

312
00:17:42,067 --> 00:17:43,784
What are the advantages of this?

313
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:47,897
Of course, the control advantage is good.

314
00:17:47,898 --> 00:17:51,552
You don't have to share ownership
or decision rights with anybody,

315
00:17:51,553 --> 00:17:53,405
and you keep control of your business.

316
00:17:53,817 --> 00:17:56,504
For the ones who actually get the loans,

317
00:17:56,505 --> 00:18:02,698
you could say that the conservative nature
of the bank's due diligence process

318
00:18:02,699 --> 00:18:07,585
probably is some sign that they are –
that you got a good company,

319
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,571
that they're willing to lend to you
because they're really conservative.

320
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:13,204
Banks would only be conservative
because they usually

321
00:18:13,205 --> 00:18:14,512
have to get the money back

322
00:18:14,513 --> 00:18:19,233
because they've lent the money out
that they received through deposits.

323
00:18:19,534 --> 00:18:21,687
They definitely want to get repaid,

324
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:23,528
which leads to the disadvantage,

325
00:18:23,529 --> 00:18:27,771
which is this commitment that you have
is typically a monthly payment

326
00:18:27,776 --> 00:18:29,217
or a quarterly payment.

327
00:18:29,218 --> 00:18:32,022
This is a commitment
that drains your cash.

328
00:18:32,023 --> 00:18:33,718
You are on the hook.

329
00:18:33,951 --> 00:18:39,336
If you don't pay back,
they can start making your life difficult,

330
00:18:39,337 --> 00:18:40,337
take you to court,

331
00:18:40,338 --> 00:18:43,280
force you into bankruptcy
depending on the country, etc.

332
00:18:43,482 --> 00:18:44,950
This is a real commitment.

333
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:47,291
Once you borrow this money,
you're on the hook to pay them back

334
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:50,210
with interest on a regular basis
over the terminal loan.

335
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,664
The second is, generally speaking,
you're going to have to put up collateral.

336
00:18:57,725 --> 00:18:59,579
You may not have to

337
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:01,474
and you have to pay
a much higher interest rate

338
00:19:01,531 --> 00:19:03,456
and a much lower term,

339
00:19:03,457 --> 00:19:06,581
much quicker term to pay back
if you don't put up collateral.

340
00:19:07,081 --> 00:19:08,179
The question is,

341
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:12,633
are you really ready to put your house up
as collateral for your business?

342
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,652
Your business fails;
you could be forced to sell your house

343
00:19:16,653 --> 00:19:19,956
or some other asset that you have

344
00:19:20,996 --> 00:19:23,506
to pay back the bank loan.

345
00:19:23,507 --> 00:19:26,935
This is a big commitment, I would say.

346
00:19:26,936 --> 00:19:31,197
Generally speaking,
the bank officers, et cetera,

347
00:19:31,198 --> 00:19:34,978
the people who make the loans
can't usually give you much advice

348
00:19:34,979 --> 00:19:36,930
on founding or managing your business.

349
00:19:36,931 --> 00:19:39,799
This is a purely financial transaction.

350
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:42,790
You have to be fairly confident

351
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:47,443
that you are going to be making money
over the term

352
00:19:47,444 --> 00:19:52,266
to be able to pay back
the loan in a good period of time.

353
00:19:53,721 --> 00:19:56,868
It's a major disadvantages here
to a bank loan although as you can see,

354
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:59,819
there are some advantages as well.

355
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,587
A lot of people do try
and get small loans at the beginning.

356
00:20:02,588 --> 00:20:05,783
Sometimes, there are other
government loan type programs

357
00:20:05,784 --> 00:20:08,705
that might have a slightly
more advantageous.

358
00:20:08,706 --> 00:20:10,783
They might give you some break
for the initial period.

359
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:13,469
Then you start paying back
after some initial period.

360
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:18,148
But there are a lot of disadvantages
to taking a loan.

361
00:20:18,806 --> 00:20:21,752
Let's talk about foundations
and public organizations.

362
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:25,994
Now, these are the organizations
that you go to when you are looking

363
00:20:25,995 --> 00:20:29,044
for a grant or a gift.

364
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:33,577
The amount is usually on a smaller side,

365
00:20:36,371 --> 00:20:39,661
5,000 up to 200,000 or so,

366
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:43,032
which could be up to
four times GDP per capita.

367
00:20:43,503 --> 00:20:46,653
A typical amount would be more like 10,000

368
00:20:46,654 --> 00:20:49,641
so relatively small amounts of money.

369
00:20:50,918 --> 00:20:54,102
A timeframe is not so great on this.

370
00:20:54,103 --> 00:20:58,472
It might take you three to six months
to hear back from them,

371
00:20:58,473 --> 00:21:01,793
not to mention you have to prepare
yourself to get the grant.

372
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:06,907
The overall timeframe
is quite long on grant writing

373
00:21:06,908 --> 00:21:09,978
as a source of investment in your company.

374
00:21:11,338 --> 00:21:14,252
Time horizon, five to eight years,

375
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:19,019
that's just to say that the foundations
are giving you a grant,

376
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,861
and they would like to see some results,

377
00:21:20,862 --> 00:21:22,996
and you may have to report back to them.

378
00:21:22,997 --> 00:21:26,169
Even if they don't ask
for a financial return,

379
00:21:26,901 --> 00:21:30,262
you may have some pressure to perform,

380
00:21:30,263 --> 00:21:31,953
to show that you've accomplished

381
00:21:31,954 --> 00:21:33,682
what you said
you want to do in your grant.

382
00:21:33,683 --> 00:21:35,233
What are the advantages here?

383
00:21:35,234 --> 00:21:39,411
The control, obviously,
just like all the other grants and gifts,

384
00:21:39,412 --> 00:21:42,053
you may take control of your company.

385
00:21:42,054 --> 00:21:43,382
This could be helpful.

386
00:21:43,383 --> 00:21:47,163
If you have a pro-social business,
if you have social entrepreneurship business,

387
00:21:47,857 --> 00:21:51,407
then foundations could be a great source

388
00:21:52,137 --> 00:21:53,832
because they may be more interested than,

389
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:58,415
say, a bank in helping
a pro-social business.

390
00:22:01,746 --> 00:22:05,526
It's a very nice outlet for someone

391
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:08,183
who is interested
in social entrepreneurship.

392
00:22:08,184 --> 00:22:09,849
It gives you credibility.

393
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:15,023
Receiving a grant from a big foundation
is very good for your reputation.

394
00:22:15,024 --> 00:22:16,768
Of course, there's no cash drain

395
00:22:16,769 --> 00:22:19,347
because you don't usually
have to pay back a grant.

396
00:22:20,643 --> 00:22:23,169
Now, the disadvantages here,
as I already mentioned,

397
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,335
it does take a long time to get a grant.

398
00:22:26,681 --> 00:22:30,506
Furthermore, you just can't apply

399
00:22:30,507 --> 00:22:32,176
to every single foundation
that's out there.

400
00:22:32,177 --> 00:22:37,568
You have to really find a foundation
that matches the mission of your startup.

401
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:45,273
If you have some kind of pro-social motive
that's attacking disease control

402
00:22:45,274 --> 00:22:46,692
in a certain part of the world
or something like that,

403
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:50,178
then you have to find a foundation
that's also interested in disease control.

404
00:22:50,179 --> 00:22:51,766
You can't just apply
to any old foundation.

405
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:54,725
It's going to take a long time
to find the right foundation

406
00:22:54,726 --> 00:22:57,854
to sometimes get to know the people
that work there

407
00:22:57,855 --> 00:23:00,391
and to write something
that's really, really targeted.

408
00:23:00,858 --> 00:23:02,262
An only disadvantage here is that

409
00:23:02,263 --> 00:23:06,610
it's sending out
a kind of a generic grant application

410
00:23:07,538 --> 00:23:11,384
is usually not considered
to be a great recipe for success.

411
00:23:11,385 --> 00:23:14,024
It's really hard to convert on those
and then actually get some money

412
00:23:14,025 --> 00:23:15,378
from a foundation.

413
00:23:15,379 --> 00:23:18,928
You have to really target it
to the mission of the foundation.

414
00:23:21,568 --> 00:23:25,115
Again, relatively small amounts of money,

415
00:23:26,036 --> 00:23:27,270
of course, it's grants.

416
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:29,480
It's nice for social entrepreneurship,

417
00:23:29,481 --> 00:23:33,257
but it's going to take a long time
when you really have

418
00:23:33,258 --> 00:23:35,761
to tailor your message
to the foundation

419
00:23:36,533 --> 00:23:38,576
or find a foundation
that's tailored already

420
00:23:38,577 --> 00:23:40,151
to what you are interested in doing.

421
00:23:40,152 --> 00:23:42,366
Now, we address an age-old question.

422
00:23:42,367 --> 00:23:45,392
Should you enter a startup competition?

423
00:23:48,123 --> 00:23:49,843
It's hard to answer this question.

424
00:23:49,844 --> 00:23:51,636
You enter a contest.

425
00:23:51,637 --> 00:23:54,940
You pitch your idea
in front of a room full of people,

426
00:23:54,941 --> 00:23:59,798
usually other entrepreneurs
and a jury which has some experts,

427
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:02,208
entrepreneurs, or investors on it,

428
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:04,518
and they evaluate your idea.

429
00:24:04,531 --> 00:24:06,311
They give you feedback.

430
00:24:06,312 --> 00:24:10,168
And if you're really, really good,
you could receive a prize

431
00:24:10,169 --> 00:24:14,578
which is often in the form of a gift.

432
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:19,532
It could also be a loan,
could be an in-kind contribution

433
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:21,258
such as office space.

434
00:24:22,133 --> 00:24:24,870
You could receive attention
from the people in the audience.

435
00:24:24,871 --> 00:24:29,936
Sometimes, investors sit in on these,
even if they're not on a jury.

436
00:24:29,937 --> 00:24:33,045
They actually can approach you afterwards
and say they're interested

437
00:24:33,046 --> 00:24:35,494
in making an investment in your company.

438
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:40,030
It's a nice way of getting exposure.

439
00:24:41,235 --> 00:24:45,471
The amounts are usually
again relatively small.

440
00:24:45,472 --> 00:24:50,101
We're talking about 1,000
to 50,000 dollars

441
00:24:50,102 --> 00:24:54,841
which is roughly GDP per capita
in whenever economy.

442
00:24:54,842 --> 00:24:59,570
Typical amount might be one-fifth
that so, say, $10,000.

443
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,802
Timeframe is relatively short.

444
00:25:02,803 --> 00:25:05,416
You enter the contests.

445
00:25:05,417 --> 00:25:07,160
You go in, you make your pitch.

446
00:25:07,161 --> 00:25:10,874
Usually, this whole thing
gets resolved within a month or so.

447
00:25:11,737 --> 00:25:14,170
Time horizon is very long
because they're not interested

448
00:25:14,171 --> 00:25:18,913
in necessarily a return,
especially if you've won a prize.

449
00:25:18,918 --> 00:25:22,001
It's just to help you get
the business launched.

450
00:25:23,236 --> 00:25:25,496
What are the disadvantages here?

451
00:25:25,497 --> 00:25:28,454
In the case of a real gift or a prize,

452
00:25:28,455 --> 00:25:32,541
you maintain control as we just discussed.

453
00:25:33,103 --> 00:25:36,067
Credibility and prestige,
you get a lot of.

454
00:25:36,068 --> 00:25:39,672
When you win the things,
it does say something.

455
00:25:39,673 --> 00:25:40,964
It can be impressive.

456
00:25:40,965 --> 00:25:46,469
It can be perhaps an entree
into other investors.

457
00:25:47,693 --> 00:25:50,996
And you do get advice and input.

458
00:25:50,997 --> 00:25:53,422
You get advice right then
and there from jury.

459
00:25:53,423 --> 00:25:57,386
Sometimes, people will approach you
and give you unsolicited advice.

460
00:25:57,387 --> 00:26:00,037
You can actually test
your ideas pretty well.

461
00:26:00,038 --> 00:26:05,611
A lot of people even enter this contest
with some new idea just to test it,

462
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:08,531
try it out, and see
what that what the people in audience say.

463
00:26:09,375 --> 00:26:12,252
It is a very good source of input.

464
00:26:13,888 --> 00:26:18,397
The big disadvantage here
is you advertise your idea.

465
00:26:18,992 --> 00:26:21,288
When you stand up there
and you give your pitch

466
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:24,253
and you're telling everybody
what you're working on.

467
00:26:25,254 --> 00:26:29,314
Depending on how easy it is
to copy your idea

468
00:26:29,315 --> 00:26:31,612
- we'll talk more about that
in the next module –

469
00:26:33,306 --> 00:26:37,373
it may or may not make sense
to broadcast what you're doing.

470
00:26:37,783 --> 00:26:40,487
On the other hand,
just to play the devil's advocate,

471
00:26:40,488 --> 00:26:43,814
most entrepreneurs
over exaggerate these issues.

472
00:26:43,815 --> 00:26:47,986
They're very afraid
of telling anybody their idea,

473
00:26:47,987 --> 00:26:51,875
whereas, serial entrepreneurs,

474
00:26:51,876 --> 00:26:54,257
people who have
a lot of entrepreneurial experience,

475
00:26:54,258 --> 00:26:56,122
they would typically go ahead
and tell the idea

476
00:26:56,125 --> 00:26:59,084
and then get the feedback
because they know the feedback's

477
00:26:59,101 --> 00:27:00,747
going to improve the idea.

478
00:27:00,748 --> 00:27:02,770
Having an idea
that's never tested on anybody

479
00:27:02,771 --> 00:27:05,146
because it's so secret generally,

480
00:27:06,805 --> 00:27:08,112
occasionally get lucky.

481
00:27:08,232 --> 00:27:10,015
Generally, it's usually a bad idea.

482
00:27:10,016 --> 00:27:12,122
Then it gets improved
by talking with people.

483
00:27:13,751 --> 00:27:15,960
It is a disadvantage, though,
in most entrepreneurs' mind.

484
00:27:15,971 --> 00:27:17,639
You have to discuss this
and think about this

485
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,348
amongst you --
amongst your founding team.

486
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:27,794
One other disadvantage here
is that a lot of founders

487
00:27:27,795 --> 00:27:30,795
will put a lot of effort
into these business plan competitions.

488
00:27:30,796 --> 00:27:34,053
What I've heard is that

489
00:27:34,054 --> 00:27:37,293
these competitions can be a distraction

490
00:27:37,294 --> 00:27:42,743
if you spend too much time trying
to tailor the message to the competition.

491
00:27:43,770 --> 00:27:48,332
So better just to go out there
and make things, get things sold,

492
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,085
get things done, get prototypes built

493
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:52,845
than it is to focus on
PowerPoint presentations

494
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:54,806
for a pitch competition.

495
00:27:55,645 --> 00:27:58,079
There are some advantages
and disadvantages to this.

496
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:03,591
Most people I think are relatively happy
they entered these competitions.

497
00:28:04,651 --> 00:28:08,344
On the other hand, you have to weigh
the plus and minuses, the control,

498
00:28:08,345 --> 00:28:11,388
the credibility you get
especially if you win

499
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:16,575
versus the dissemination of what it is
you're working on.

500
00:28:17,362 --> 00:28:19,870
Here, we're going to talk about
angel investors.

501
00:28:19,871 --> 00:28:22,406
We're going to distinguish
between the angels and angel groups.

502
00:28:22,407 --> 00:28:25,866
We'll talk more about the angel groups
in the next segment

503
00:28:25,867 --> 00:28:28,624
which is going to be on expansion
and growth financing.

504
00:28:28,878 --> 00:28:31,331
Now, here, we're going to focus
more on the seed financing

505
00:28:31,332 --> 00:28:37,061
and startup financing aspect of it,
which is you are going to pitch your idea

506
00:28:37,062 --> 00:28:40,480
and sell a share of your company
to a wealthy individual.

507
00:28:41,108 --> 00:28:45,190
Usually, it's somebody who's already been
a successful entrepreneur

508
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:47,510
who made money in their business

509
00:28:47,511 --> 00:28:50,583
and then who would like to help out
other entrepreneurs.

510
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:53,274
It's really a nice match

511
00:28:53,369 --> 00:28:56,469
between people
who have already been successful

512
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,223
and people who need financing.

513
00:28:59,345 --> 00:29:01,251
These are equity-based investments.

514
00:29:01,252 --> 00:29:06,445
That means you are going to sell
a share of the company to the investor.

515
00:29:07,804 --> 00:29:12,132
The amount range is here,
usually starting on the order

516
00:29:12,133 --> 00:29:16,686
of 50,000 and going up to 500,000,
which is ten times GDP per capita.

517
00:29:17,179 --> 00:29:23,301
Typical amount might be half
that maximum so around 200,000 or so,

518
00:29:23,302 --> 00:29:24,912
four times GDP.

519
00:29:25,832 --> 00:29:29,825
Usually, this can be accomplished
in a month or two.

520
00:29:29,826 --> 00:29:33,954
And the time horizon that the angel
has is relatively long, five to ten years.

521
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:38,402
They don't necessarily want to cash out
of their investment straight away.

522
00:29:38,403 --> 00:29:41,894
But they do want to get a return
on their investment

523
00:29:41,895 --> 00:29:45,104
at some point in the medium term.

524
00:29:47,126 --> 00:29:49,338
What are some of the advantages here?

525
00:29:49,499 --> 00:29:54,794
First one is you can receive input
or advice from the angel.

526
00:29:54,795 --> 00:29:58,487
Now, it depends on where
the expertise of the angel is.

527
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:03,022
If you have a good match
between your sector and the angel sector,

528
00:30:03,023 --> 00:30:06,281
then you could actually receive some
very, very good advice

529
00:30:06,282 --> 00:30:09,638
or input on how to found your business,
how to build your business,

530
00:30:09,639 --> 00:30:11,093
how to manage your business.

531
00:30:11,821 --> 00:30:12,905
There's no collateral.

532
00:30:12,906 --> 00:30:14,726
There's no interest payments.

533
00:30:14,727 --> 00:30:16,621
This is a pure equity investment.

534
00:30:17,691 --> 00:30:20,743
Angel investors could take large risks

535
00:30:20,744 --> 00:30:24,150
because they're going to make
these investments in several companies.

536
00:30:24,262 --> 00:30:27,562
They may be willing to bet on somebody
who's very ambitious,

537
00:30:27,563 --> 00:30:29,067
who got a very good idea.

538
00:30:29,068 --> 00:30:33,463
They may think they can help
to get the business built up.

539
00:30:33,723 --> 00:30:36,686
There are a lot of advantages here
for angel investors.

540
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:43,968
A disadvantage is – relative to a lot
of the gifts and grants and etc.

541
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,668
that we've talking about so far –
is you are going to now start

542
00:30:47,669 --> 00:30:49,055
relinquishing control.

543
00:30:49,154 --> 00:30:50,974
In general, of course,
if you will sell equity,

544
00:30:50,975 --> 00:30:54,112
the more money you need
for expansion for growth,

545
00:30:54,172 --> 00:30:57,414
the more control
you're going to have to give up.

546
00:30:57,543 --> 00:31:02,505
Also, the earlier that you start looking

547
00:31:02,508 --> 00:31:04,042
to raise larger amounts of money,

548
00:31:04,043 --> 00:31:06,492
the more control
you're going to have to give up

549
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:08,442
to entice the investors.

550
00:31:08,477 --> 00:31:11,851
because these early stage investments
are highly risky.

551
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:15,191
To entice the investor
generally speaking,

552
00:31:15,192 --> 00:31:19,263
you have to give up more
of your company in the early stages

553
00:31:19,264 --> 00:31:20,507
than you do in the later stages.

554
00:31:20,508 --> 00:31:22,265
You're going to have
to give up some control now.

555
00:31:22,295 --> 00:31:25,310
You're going to share
some decision-making power with the angel.

556
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:30,116
The person may be
on your Board of Directors.

557
00:31:31,029 --> 00:31:34,896
They already have a stake in your company
and have a say in what you do.

558
00:31:34,923 --> 00:31:37,495
This is the psychological hurdle

559
00:31:37,496 --> 00:31:41,395
that a lot of entrepreneurs
don't want to cross.

560
00:31:42,186 --> 00:31:45,752
But in many cases, it is worth considering

561
00:31:45,753 --> 00:31:48,790
especially if they can bring in
the amount of money that you need

562
00:31:48,791 --> 00:31:50,358
to launch your business.

563
00:31:51,970 --> 00:31:56,031
Now, if the angel investor
is inexperienced

564
00:31:56,032 --> 00:31:59,539
in your particular sector,
this could be a big disadvantage.

565
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:03,174
Aside from the fact
that the advice may not be as good,

566
00:32:03,175 --> 00:32:05,599
it could actually be bad advice.

567
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,073
This is something
that you need to think about

568
00:32:07,074 --> 00:32:10,023
which is when you are raising money
from an angel investor,

569
00:32:10,024 --> 00:32:15,066
it's highly preferable that this person
be in the same sector as your business

570
00:32:15,067 --> 00:32:17,624
that understands a sector,
has a prior exit,

571
00:32:17,625 --> 00:32:21,587
a prior company in the same area,
roughly in the same areas

572
00:32:21,588 --> 00:32:24,149
that the person understands
what you're going through

573
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,123
and what your market
looks like, et cetera.

574
00:32:26,124 --> 00:32:27,870
If the person's very far away,

575
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:31,158
a pretty big disadvantage
is you start getting his advice,

576
00:32:31,159 --> 00:32:36,329
and the advice isn't
really correct for your sector

577
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:41,535
that can lead to conflict, problems,
bad moves on your part, etc.

578
00:32:41,611 --> 00:32:44,540
These are some of the disadvantages
to the angel investors.

579
00:32:45,256 --> 00:32:49,582
Although as we see before,
there are plenty of other advantages.

580
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:53,502
What we presented here is an overview

581
00:32:53,732 --> 00:32:58,514
of the sources of funding
for seed and startup phases

582
00:32:59,213 --> 00:33:01,601
and the process that have to go through.

583
00:33:02,623 --> 00:33:06,367
It's basically on one page
everything we just discussed.

584
00:33:06,991 --> 00:33:12,713
Now, what we did here is on the side,
we put the source of financing.

585
00:33:13,453 --> 00:33:16,783
Then what we did is we wrote in red ink

586
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:20,005
we thought things that the entrepreneur
should be aware of

587
00:33:20,006 --> 00:33:21,515
and in green, we thought
some of the things

588
00:33:21,516 --> 00:33:23,622
that could be the sum
of the pluses involved.

589
00:33:24,683 --> 00:33:26,675
If you just look at friends and family,

590
00:33:26,676 --> 00:33:30,419
we're highlighting here the fact, well,

591
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,927
these are relatively
small amounts of money.

592
00:33:35,143 --> 00:33:39,582
Actually, that goes for pretty much
all of these first five.

593
00:33:41,947 --> 00:33:45,906
If there's something wrong
with your business,

594
00:33:46,414 --> 00:33:48,912
it could hurt your relationship.

595
00:33:49,742 --> 00:33:53,615
That's also related to the fact
there's not much of a separation

596
00:33:54,251 --> 00:33:59,745
between the investor in your team.

597
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:02,908
Basically, you know them.
They're your relatives and friends.

598
00:34:05,965 --> 00:34:09,565
In terms of input,
you're not going to get much input

599
00:34:09,565 --> 00:34:13,435
from your friends and family
and probably not

600
00:34:13,436 --> 00:34:15,710
from the crowd funding investors, either.

601
00:34:18,951 --> 00:34:23,210
However, one thing that we see
is about the independence,

602
00:34:23,212 --> 00:34:27,955
is that you basically keep control
whenever you have a gift or grant.

603
00:34:28,975 --> 00:34:33,512
That holds also for the first five
because most of these are involving

604
00:34:33,513 --> 00:34:37,391
grants, loans, and gifts.

605
00:34:37,393 --> 00:34:39,625
Therefore, you're not
actually selling equity.

606
00:34:42,487 --> 00:34:45,906
In terms of crowd funding,
we already discussed the amounts.

607
00:34:46,917 --> 00:34:49,143
You're not going to get a lot of input.

608
00:34:49,712 --> 00:34:54,851
And we just highlighted, if you recall,
that it could be bad if you don't execute.

609
00:34:54,851 --> 00:34:56,909
In other words, reputation is good.

610
00:34:56,911 --> 00:35:00,903
You can save that you receive money
on a crowd funding platform.

611
00:35:00,904 --> 00:35:04,318
However, especially
if you're pre-selling, be careful

612
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:09,160
because if you don't execute well,
it could actually hurt your reputation.

613
00:35:10,322 --> 00:35:14,398
For banks, the key point here is that
it drains your cash.

614
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,681
You're on the hook to pay back that loan.

615
00:35:20,105 --> 00:35:23,789
On the other hand,
there's due diligence process.

616
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:25,995
It means that
if you are successful in getting a loan,

617
00:35:25,996 --> 00:35:28,864
that means they probably believe
that you are going to have

618
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:30,235
a successful business.

619
00:35:30,949 --> 00:35:32,822
It's good for your reputation.

620
00:35:33,244 --> 00:35:37,111
Foundations, the big issue here
is how long it takes

621
00:35:37,112 --> 00:35:38,741
to raise money for a foundation.

622
00:35:38,742 --> 00:35:43,800
Three to six months is a lot of time
in a life of a startup company.

623
00:35:45,164 --> 00:35:48,460
And you have to find an organization
with the same mission.

624
00:35:49,206 --> 00:35:53,457
Startup competitions are great,
great advice.

625
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:56,148
If you win it, you get a great prestige.

626
00:35:56,149 --> 00:35:58,098
Good for your reputation.

627
00:35:58,099 --> 00:36:02,965
On the downside,
you are advertising what you're doing

628
00:36:02,966 --> 00:36:04,966
to the rest of world.

629
00:36:06,305 --> 00:36:13,015
Then finally, with angels,
of course, you can get input.

630
00:36:13,615 --> 00:36:17,833
That's key you give up equity,

631
00:36:17,834 --> 00:36:19,606
which is basically related to this idea

632
00:36:19,607 --> 00:36:24,383
that you need to relinquish
control of your company.

633
00:36:24,384 --> 00:36:27,009
Not complete control
because most angel investors

634
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:32,086
are not going to take over your business
or have a majority of your shares.

635
00:36:32,087 --> 00:36:35,141
However, you're going to give up
some kind of control.

636
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,882
On the other hand,
they're not going to ask for collateral,

637
00:36:37,883 --> 00:36:41,613
and you are going to be able to put
the money to good use.

638
00:36:41,614 --> 00:36:44,973
Let's now look at example
of seed and startup financing.

639
00:36:44,974 --> 00:36:49,728
Then we'll see you very, very soon
in the next segment

640
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:52,626
which is about growth
and expansion financing.

641
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:53,636
Thanks a lot.
