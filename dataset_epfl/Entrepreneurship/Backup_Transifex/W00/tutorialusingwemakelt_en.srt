00:00:04,355 --> 00:00:07,541
Hello and welcome 
to the <i>Launching New Ventures</i> tutorial

2
00:00:07,541 --> 00:00:09,503
on using WeMakeIt.com.

3
00:00:09,673 --> 00:00:10,952
My name is Shirah,

4
00:00:10,952 --> 00:00:13,481
and I'm a course assistant
at the Venture MOOC headquarters,

5
00:00:13,481 --> 00:00:14,588
and I'm going to walk you through

6
00:00:14,588 --> 00:00:17,398
the various elements
of a crowdfunding campaign.

7
00:00:17,948 --> 00:00:22,018
Launching a crowdfunding campaign
is not mandatory to pass this course,

8
00:00:22,028 --> 00:00:25,138
but we do recommend that you take
advantage of this opportunity

9
00:00:25,138 --> 00:00:27,478
to think about the mechanics
of a campaign,

10
00:00:27,478 --> 00:00:31,778
and get familiar with a quality 
crowdfunding platform.

11
00:00:31,778 --> 00:00:36,898
As an entrepreneur, looking 
to market, develop, or sell your product,

12
00:00:36,898 --> 00:00:38,588
you should take a close look

13
00:00:38,588 --> 00:00:42,808
at which crowdfunding platform 
is most suitable for your venture.

14
00:00:43,135 --> 00:00:45,995
You might decide not to crowdfund 
at all in the early stages,

15
00:00:45,995 --> 00:00:48,025
since crowdfunding itself 
carries some risk,

16
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:50,094
and requires a great deal of preparation,

17
00:00:50,094 --> 00:00:52,624
which you might only be ready
to take on when launching

18
00:00:52,624 --> 00:00:54,614
your second or third product.

19
00:00:55,164 --> 00:00:58,274
However, crowdfunding can also
provide a lot of benefits

20
00:00:58,274 --> 00:01:00,844
including raising awareness 
about your brand,

21
00:01:00,844 --> 00:01:03,634
providing liquidity for
further product testing,

22
00:01:03,634 --> 00:01:07,294
testing market receptiveness,
reaching early adopters,

23
00:01:07,294 --> 00:01:10,174
and it can even be used 
as an additional sales channel.

24
00:01:10,664 --> 00:01:12,714
Today, I'm going to show you how to set up

25
00:01:12,714 --> 00:01:15,484
a crowdfunding campaign 
on WeMakeIt.com,

26
00:01:15,484 --> 00:01:18,444
our crowdfunding partner
for the Venture MOOC course.

27
00:01:18,694 --> 00:01:21,694
WeMakeIt is a Swiss-based
crowdfunding platform

28
00:01:21,694 --> 00:01:24,154
which features a range 
of cultural and commercial projects

29
00:01:24,154 --> 00:01:25,634
from around the world.

30
00:01:26,134 --> 00:01:30,134
They have one of the highest 
project success rates of all platforms.

31
00:01:30,869 --> 00:01:35,789
More than two-thirds of all projects 
on WeMakeIt.com surpass their goals.

32
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:38,419
This beats the average by a good margin.

33
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:41,889
They're also one of few
multicultural crowdfunding platforms

34
00:01:41,889 --> 00:01:44,139
that thought about crossing 
language, culture,

35
00:01:44,139 --> 00:01:46,519
and currency barriers 
from the very beginning.

36
00:01:47,069 --> 00:01:49,629
While internationalization 
was more of an after thought

37
00:01:49,629 --> 00:01:51,159
for most other platforms,

38
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:54,409
WeMakeIt.com was designed
to go global from the start.

39
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:58,209
It's frequented by English,
French, and German speakers.

40
00:01:59,480 --> 00:02:02,470
The platform originates 
from Zurich, Switzerland,

41
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:06,020
and it's held to many of the 
same standards Swiss banks follow

42
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,750
and therefore, it's highly trusted.

43
00:02:08,130 --> 00:02:10,170
While burdensome for WeMakeIt

44
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:13,290
to comply with the standards 
and regulations at times,

45
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:15,400
it's very secure for us users.

46
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:18,872
We recommend that you create a campaign,

47
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:21,712
try it out, and see if it
can be useful for your venture.

48
00:02:22,113 --> 00:02:25,633
It's also quite user friendly, 
and it has a very nice mobile site.

49
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,200
The first thing you need to do
is go to WeMakeIt.com,

50
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,330
choose the language
you want to operate in.

51
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:34,190
We have German, French,
and English options here.

52
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:36,308
Create an account!

53
00:02:36,668 --> 00:02:38,378
Before you create a campaign,

54
00:02:38,378 --> 00:02:41,268
take a look at the different projects 
featured on the site,

55
00:02:41,268 --> 00:02:43,878
and think about what kind of language
and tone did they use

56
00:02:43,878 --> 00:02:45,588
to talk to their potential backer?

57
00:02:45,978 --> 00:02:47,748
What kind of perks do they offer?

58
00:02:48,058 --> 00:02:49,528
What images do they provide?

59
00:02:50,899 --> 00:02:52,749
Then, after you do all that,

60
00:02:52,749 --> 00:02:55,649
you're going to be ready
to click on <i>Submit a Project</i>.

61
00:02:55,649 --> 00:02:57,609
It's right up here.

62
00:02:57,799 --> 00:03:00,579
Once you decide to submit a project,

63
00:03:00,579 --> 00:03:03,419
the first thing your going to need 
to do is to log in.

64
00:03:03,969 --> 00:03:05,399
You have a few options.

65
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:08,617
Let's just go with <i>Email</i> for now.

66
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:11,087
We click there.

67
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,960
We're going to want 
to create a new profile.

68
00:03:15,293 --> 00:03:17,483
You arrive here in the log-in page,

69
00:03:17,483 --> 00:03:19,993
you're going to need to
enter your first and last name,

70
00:03:19,993 --> 00:03:23,863
email, screen name, 
password, and confirmation.

71
00:03:24,724 --> 00:03:28,044
These are nothing more 
than the usual standard.

72
00:03:28,503 --> 00:03:31,663
You're going to go ahead
and click on <i>Create a profile</i>.

73
00:03:32,224 --> 00:03:37,094
Now we have some detailed instructions 
here on how to proceed.

74
00:03:37,294 --> 00:03:40,303
The thing that I really love
about WeMakeIt.com

75
00:03:40,303 --> 00:03:42,123
is that it's very straightforward

76
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:44,763
and their coaches are going 
to guide you through the process.

77
00:03:45,053 --> 00:03:50,603
If we just come in here 
and have a zoom in on the instructions,

78
00:03:50,603 --> 00:03:55,643
we're going to note that there are
guidelines that need to be followed.

79
00:03:55,873 --> 00:03:57,323
So that's something to look at

80
00:03:57,323 --> 00:04:03,673
before you go ahead and fill out 
your project concept pitch to them.

81
00:04:04,556 --> 00:04:07,076
You're going to note 
that there is an online tool.

82
00:04:07,346 --> 00:04:09,276
It's going to help you 
to develop your campaign.

83
00:04:09,796 --> 00:04:13,156
This is somewhere where you can 
upload text, images, video,

84
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:14,766
and add your rewards.

85
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:19,440
In addition, you're going 
to be able to directly put in

86
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,350
a slide-share presentation.

87
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,470
That means, if you're not able

88
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:28,950
to have access to high quality 
video equipment

89
00:04:29,643 --> 00:04:31,593
then another,

90
00:04:31,593 --> 00:04:37,313
also convincing and potentially
very effective and persuasive tool

91
00:04:37,313 --> 00:04:41,313
would be a slide-deck 
that you can complete offline,

92
00:04:42,011 --> 00:04:45,011
and then just upload to SlideShare

93
00:04:45,011 --> 00:04:48,241
as we covered in the SlideShare tutorial,

94
00:04:48,241 --> 00:04:51,471
which you haven't seen yet, 
go and take a look at that.

95
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,701
That will give you all the tools you need

96
00:04:53,701 --> 00:04:57,651
to be able to put
your info onto SlideShare,

97
00:04:57,651 --> 00:05:03,351
and also to soon be able to embed it
into your WeMakeIt project.

98
00:05:05,088 --> 00:05:08,858
Coming back to the directions 
for submitting a project on WeMakeIt,

99
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:11,168
you'll see that there are coaches here

100
00:05:11,168 --> 00:05:13,758
that are going to be able to give
you feedback and tips.

101
00:05:14,078 --> 00:05:16,278
You really have 
some great service here.

102
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:21,408
Before you are able to upload
a video and other multimedia content,

103
00:05:21,818 --> 00:05:27,378
your first simple project description
pitch is going to be looked at

104
00:05:27,378 --> 00:05:29,768
by the WeMakeIt staff.

105
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:32,938
And then they're going to get back
to you and tell you how to proceed.

106
00:05:33,448 --> 00:05:35,618
Now zooming back out of this page,

107
00:05:37,448 --> 00:05:41,788
we can just scroll down
and go straight into the Project Pitch.

108
00:05:41,834 --> 00:05:45,714
This is your first pitch 
to the WeMakeIt staff,

109
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:47,454
so you want to make a good impression.

110
00:05:47,604 --> 00:05:52,204
Go ahead and name 
your project, right at the top.

111
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:55,104
A short title that's to the point.

112
00:05:55,444 --> 00:05:56,664
Then you're going to go ahead

113
00:05:56,664 --> 00:06:00,964
and be able to give some description,
up to 700 characters.

114
00:06:01,809 --> 00:06:03,669
Go ahead and enter a website,

115
00:06:03,669 --> 00:06:07,089
if you already have started
a website for your new venture.

116
00:06:08,176 --> 00:06:13,566
And you're going to want 
to chose the currency;

117
00:06:13,566 --> 00:06:16,866
right now you have the option
of Euro or Swiss francs.

118
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:23,698
This is going to be the currency
by which they measure your funding goal,

119
00:06:23,698 --> 00:06:26,478
and it's also going to be currency
in which you receive your payout.

120
00:06:26,748 --> 00:06:30,468
Of course, the amount 
that you are paid

121
00:06:30,468 --> 00:06:33,328
can be converted into any currency 
that you select,

122
00:06:33,328 --> 00:06:34,848
no matter where you're located.

123
00:06:35,926 --> 00:06:37,866
You're going to want to also detail

124
00:06:37,866 --> 00:06:40,586
how much money you wish 
to raise using WeMakeIt.

125
00:06:40,916 --> 00:06:43,976
This is going to be 
what they call your <i>funding goal</i>.

126
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:48,965
Other good information to provide 
is the total budget of your project,

127
00:06:48,965 --> 00:06:54,005
and how much of that has already 
been assured or guaranteed.

128
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:56,282
Now that you input

129
00:06:56,282 --> 00:06:59,302
the information on your budget
and on your fundraising goal,

130
00:06:59,442 --> 00:07:02,632
we'll move just scrolling down the page

131
00:07:02,632 --> 00:07:05,302
and we come to the part 
where we're going to choose

132
00:07:05,302 --> 00:07:09,102
which languages we want 
our project to appear in.

133
00:07:10,098 --> 00:07:13,218
English here is already
selected by default.

134
00:07:13,895 --> 00:07:16,095
There's also German
and French to choose from.

135
00:07:16,385 --> 00:07:19,785
Now, just remember 
that it can be great for your page

136
00:07:19,785 --> 00:07:23,615
to be searchable for English,
French, and German speakers,

137
00:07:23,615 --> 00:07:26,225
but you yourself are going to
be the one responsible

138
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:29,405
for translating all of the content
on your own page.

139
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,245
Do take that into account.

140
00:07:32,175 --> 00:07:36,175
You need to next choose 
when to start your campaign.

141
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,680
A section on the scouts 
for WeMakeIt isn't really applicable

142
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:45,490
for this situation
since you're doing this

143
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:48,160
in conjunction with 
the Venture MOOC course.

144
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:53,370
And finally, you're going to fill
out the section <i>About Me</i>

145
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,250
and make sure you accept 
the terms and guidelines.

146
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:59,250
Then you can go ahead 
and submit your project.

147
00:08:00,235 --> 00:08:02,055
Okay, so now that you have 
submitted your project,

148
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:05,265
you have officially begun 
your journey into crowdfunding.

149
00:08:05,595 --> 00:08:08,595
And you're going to be contacted
by the WeMakeIt staff.

150
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:11,165
They are going to assist you

151
00:08:11,165 --> 00:08:15,165
all the way throughout the course
of your crowdfunding campaign.

152
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,250
And this is going to be something

153
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:23,910
that you can use the URL page 
for your crowdfunding campaign.

154
00:08:23,910 --> 00:08:25,840
Submit this on Coursera

155
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:30,710
as part of your entrepreneurial marketing
and persuasiveness grade.

156
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,840
There will be more information
on that coming up soon.

157
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:37,926
Stay tuned, enjoy the tutorials,
enjoy the coursework,

158
00:08:37,926 --> 00:08:40,006
and we will see you soon.
