1
00:00:07,844 --> 00:00:10,804
Welcome back, this is segment 1.1.

2
00:00:10,804 --> 00:00:12,857
During the segment
we are going to introduce you

3
00:00:12,857 --> 00:00:14,321
to the set up of this MOOC.

4
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:16,195
We have designed
five weeks for you

5
00:00:16,195 --> 00:00:19,156
that cover the essentials
of the entrepreneurial process.

6
00:00:19,156 --> 00:00:21,909
So let's review what 
we just discussed last time.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:25,840
We discussed what 
entrepreneurship is about.

8
00:00:25,841 --> 00:00:29,404
We talked about entrepreneurship
as the process where you create value

9
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,914
by bringing resources together.

10
00:00:31,914 --> 00:00:35,657
We also discussed the fact
that it's not a new concept.

11
00:00:35,667 --> 00:00:38,376
Cantino was discussing this already
in the 17th century,

12
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:42,469
thinking about Marco Polo's journey,
and some of the risks that he took,

13
00:00:42,469 --> 00:00:44,762
some of the innovation aspects.

14
00:00:44,763 --> 00:00:48,885
So, it's been quite a long time
that people studied entrepreneurship.

15
00:00:48,886 --> 00:00:50,461
And why it's so important nowadays,

16
00:00:50,461 --> 00:00:53,783
is because it's one of the very 
liberating types of business concepts--

17
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:56,821
it's your imagination that sets
the limits of what you can do.

18
00:00:56,821 --> 00:00:59,977
Initially at least because,
you can come up with new things,

19
00:00:59,977 --> 00:01:03,101
how to develop new products,
ways to serve customers.

20
00:01:03,102 --> 00:01:07,382
So, what you can imagine
is actually the initial limit.

21
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:11,584
So, we've chosen here
five critical topics

22
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:14,306
that we've put in chunks 
of one week each,

23
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:17,691
so that you have five pieces
of the entrepreneurial process.

24
00:01:17,691 --> 00:01:20,025
(Marc) Exactly, so we start off
with a more general discussion

25
00:01:20,025 --> 00:01:21,868
of what is entrepreneurship.

26
00:01:21,868 --> 00:01:24,185
(Chris) And then we move on in week two

27
00:01:24,186 --> 00:01:27,684
to identifying and evaluating
business opportunities.

28
00:01:27,684 --> 00:01:30,400
(Marc) And then, in week three,
we cover one of the core aspects

29
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,201
of the entrepreneurship process

30
00:01:32,201 --> 00:01:33,652
which is entrepreneurial marketing

31
00:01:33,652 --> 00:01:35,920
because you need to attract
customers for your venture.

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,945
And then we have in week four,
another core aspect,

33
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:42,494
which is raising and managing money.

34
00:01:42,721 --> 00:01:44,688
And then, week five,
we talk about value capture,

35
00:01:44,688 --> 00:01:47,544
because you shouldn't only 
develop an innovation

36
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:50,494
but you should also be able
to profit from that innovation.

37
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:53,700
(Chris) Now, to enhance your learning
experience in this course,

38
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,589
we're also going to accompany our lectures
and interviews on entrepreneurs

39
00:01:57,589 --> 00:02:01,750
with assignments, and quizzes,
and participation in a forum.

40
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:03,112
(Marc) And in addition, you know,

41
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:05,297
you are supposed to write
a business concept proposal

42
00:02:05,297 --> 00:02:06,927
that summarizes your venture,

43
00:02:06,927 --> 00:02:09,973
what you are intending to do
in your entrepreneurship process.

44
00:02:09,973 --> 00:02:13,196
(Chris) And then, finally, we have
a somewhat unique experience,

45
00:02:13,196 --> 00:02:15,585
which is we are going
to have you participate

46
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:17,940
in a real crowdfounding campaign.

47
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,780
So, let's walk you through
each of these weeks,

48
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:22,005
with one slide each.

49
00:02:22,005 --> 00:02:23,718
So, it's a very brief summary.

50
00:02:23,718 --> 00:02:27,320
So in week one, as Chris just mentioned,
we talk about what is entrepreneurship.

51
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,386
We are going to sensitize you
to the differences

52
00:02:29,386 --> 00:02:31,719
between different types
of entrepreneurship,

53
00:02:31,719 --> 00:02:35,382
and also the difference to normal
management in that sense.

54
00:02:35,383 --> 00:02:37,982
If you look at the differences
in entrepreneurship

55
00:02:37,983 --> 00:02:41,140
you could say that they are more
the technology driven types of startups,

56
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,041
and then they are more the self-employment
type of entrepreneurial companies

57
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:47,240
where the former,
the technology-driven ones,

58
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,900
would have strong ambitions,

59
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:52,359
they are often found and based
on some kind of cool innovation,

60
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:54,511
and you know, create markets.

61
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:58,584
While the self-employment entrepreneurship
type would be more about

62
00:02:58,605 --> 00:03:02,393
replicating markets,
copying what others have done, etc.

63
00:03:02,393 --> 00:03:05,622
Both I think are valid and important
forms of entrepreneurship

64
00:03:05,622 --> 00:03:08,974
because they have important functions
within the economy,

65
00:03:08,974 --> 00:03:13,192
but on the other hand, we needed to focus
the MOOC on some type of venture,

66
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:14,793
which are the technology-driven ones.

67
00:03:14,793 --> 00:03:18,585
But that does not mean that the content
would be only relevant for those.

68
00:03:18,586 --> 00:03:22,736
Yeah, I think that this could be useful
for people who want a lifestyle business--

69
00:03:22,737 --> 00:03:25,689
as well as those who really want
to look more for a growth business.

70
00:03:25,689 --> 00:03:26,490
Exactly.

71
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,579
So, both of these constituencies,
these target groups could be relevant;

72
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,980
so we invite you to understand
these differences,

73
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,852
because then you also know
what are other particular challenges

74
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:38,838
that you will be facing 
as an entrepreneur

75
00:03:38,838 --> 00:03:40,773
when you create one
or the other type of venture.

76
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:42,827
So in a nutshell, in week two,

77
00:03:42,827 --> 00:03:47,492
we are going to talk about evaluating
and identifying opportunities.

78
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:51,587
And here we are going to discuss
a little bit about technology,

79
00:03:51,588 --> 00:03:55,259
and how technology might be 
applied to different markets.

80
00:03:55,321 --> 00:03:58,141
Exactly, and, what we wanted you 
to understand is that markets

81
00:03:58,141 --> 00:03:59,654
have different characteristics.

82
00:03:59,664 --> 00:04:02,260
they present, more or less,
fertile ground for fund creation,

83
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:04,250
so actually, this opportunity
identification stage

84
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:06,598
is a highly critical one 
because you might identify

85
00:04:06,598 --> 00:04:10,005
more or less favorable 
environments for fund creation.

86
00:04:10,005 --> 00:04:12,174
And we are going to talk
about this aspect,

87
00:04:12,174 --> 00:04:15,734
but we are also going to talk about
how you can systematically improve

88
00:04:15,734 --> 00:04:17,791
your abilities to see
good opportunities out there,

89
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:20,297
which is a highly critical skill I think.

90
00:04:20,298 --> 00:04:23,085
So in week three we're going to talk
about entrepreneurial marketing

91
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:26,012
which is another critical aspect
in your venture creation journey,

92
00:04:26,012 --> 00:04:29,182
because it's about creating
relationships with your customers,

93
00:04:29,183 --> 00:04:31,609
attracting their money,

94
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:34,378
trying to sell the products
to these folks,

95
00:04:34,378 --> 00:04:36,583
and in order to understand
entrepreneurial marketing

96
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:37,905
as a strategic manager,

97
00:04:37,905 --> 00:04:41,286
you have to really differentiate between
more the strategic types of decisions

98
00:04:41,286 --> 00:04:43,101
which are my market segments,

99
00:04:43,101 --> 00:04:46,680
and how should my customers
perceive me in these market segments.

100
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:49,687
And then, differentiate that from
the implementation issues,

101
00:04:49,687 --> 00:04:51,413
which would be more
like the marketing mix,

102
00:04:51,413 --> 00:04:53,108
which type of pricing you do,

103
00:04:53,109 --> 00:04:55,022
which types of distribution 
channels you chose.

104
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:57,322
(Chris) As Peter Drucker said,

105
00:04:57,322 --> 00:05:01,414
"The purpose of a business
is to create a customer."

106
00:05:01,414 --> 00:05:04,455
(Marc) Exactly, and not creating 
just a product or a technology.

107
00:05:04,455 --> 00:05:07,840
Because you need to survive as a company
and you have to make these sales.

108
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,263
And you have to grow your company
by making even more sales.

109
00:05:10,263 --> 00:05:13,344
And entrepreneurial marketing
is exactly about that.

110
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:16,876
You are going to have expenses
to develop your products and services,

111
00:05:16,876 --> 00:05:18,277
and do your marketing,

112
00:05:18,277 --> 00:05:22,279
so in week four, we are going to talk
about a very critical aspect of this

113
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:25,889
which is, raising financing.

114
00:05:25,890 --> 00:05:28,623
Exactly, and when you think
about the expense that you have,

115
00:05:28,624 --> 00:05:30,381
it's cash outflows.

116
00:05:30,381 --> 00:05:32,320
And what happens
if you cannot pay your bills?

117
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,182
In your private life,
and in your company life,

118
00:05:34,182 --> 00:05:35,487
you go bankrupt.

119
00:05:35,487 --> 00:05:37,701
So, in essence, the cash
that you have in the company

120
00:05:37,701 --> 00:05:40,141
is like the air that you breath.

121
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:44,135
What we will be talking about is sources
where you can get that air

122
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,811
for your company to breath.

123
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:48,375
(Chris) Right, we're going 
to go through the different stages

124
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:51,879
and talk about some different sources
of financing at each stage,

125
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,062
and one of those is going to be again,
the crowdfounding aspect of it.

126
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:59,654
So, we can think about the crowdfunding
as being a potential boost,

127
00:05:59,655 --> 00:06:04,270
to get a little bit of air there,
while you are starting your business.

128
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:07,984
And then, we're already in week five--
the MOOC is short, we told you,

129
00:06:07,985 --> 00:06:10,200
because we are going to focus
on the essentials.

130
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:13,814
And in this week five, we have
another key element which is--

131
00:06:13,815 --> 00:06:15,714
- Critical one.
- which is profiting from your innovation,

132
00:06:15,714 --> 00:06:17,327
it's value capture.

133
00:06:17,328 --> 00:06:20,684
Because it's not given that you actually
capture the value that you are creating,

134
00:06:20,684 --> 00:06:24,592
there are other parties out there, 
your customers, your employees,

135
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:28,602
other people who want
to have a share of the profit pie

136
00:06:28,602 --> 00:06:30,023
that you are creating,

137
00:06:30,023 --> 00:06:32,523
so you have to smart 
in how to structure your deals,

138
00:06:32,523 --> 00:06:34,288
how you defend the pie,

139
00:06:34,288 --> 00:06:36,754
or the share of the pie
that should accrue to you.

140
00:06:36,754 --> 00:06:39,596
Right, so what we'll do
in this particular week

141
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:43,823
is we will discuss protecting your ideas,
through intellectual property,

142
00:06:43,823 --> 00:06:45,274
and other ideas.

143
00:06:45,274 --> 00:06:51,264
We will also talk about the capturing
of value relative to your partners,

144
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:53,530
and how you make money
relative to your partners.

145
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,012
We'll think about legal liability
and other legal issues.

146
00:06:57,013 --> 00:06:59,079
- Whet you want to have pivoting?
- Yes, exactly!

147
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,002
You have to figure out, 
do I change my product a little bit here,

148
00:07:02,002 --> 00:07:03,873
and then wait to attract more?

149
00:07:03,873 --> 00:07:05,620
You might be part way 
through your idea,

150
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:07,342
and then you might be
testing it in the market,

151
00:07:07,342 --> 00:07:08,582
and figuring out that,

152
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:10,580
that's not exactly 
the right market that I want,

153
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,639
and I need to change a little bit.

154
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:14,866
So thinking aloud about pivoting
is super important.

155
00:07:14,866 --> 00:07:17,136
And then also about growing
and scaling your venture.

156
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,320
You have to grow your venture,

157
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,012
attract additional customers,

158
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:23,791
you have to scale it up
to actually get most of the value

159
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,870
that you potentially could create.

160
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,431
- Right.
- So, that's week five.

161
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:32,087
It is highly critical, and it basically
it's the final bracket

162
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:35,445
the final endpoint,
the milestone of the whole MOOC,

163
00:07:35,445 --> 00:07:38,923
because we want to have you
there as a succeeding entrepreneur

164
00:07:38,923 --> 00:07:41,289
who also captures the value.

165
00:07:41,682 --> 00:07:45,584
So, by now, you may ask yourself, 
"Is entrepreneurship actually for me?"

166
00:07:45,592 --> 00:07:49,504
Is it for you a viable option,
a viable choice for your life?

167
00:07:49,505 --> 00:07:52,100
And I think it's.--
there's no definite answer.

168
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:55,581
Some people actually know it and say,
"I want to be an entrepreneur",

169
00:07:55,581 --> 00:07:58,148
while others say, "maybe".

170
00:07:58,148 --> 00:08:02,090
And so we invite everyone 
to experience it,

171
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,520
to try to understand
what it means,

172
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:07,177
because ultimately,
it's an important choice in your life.

173
00:08:07,177 --> 00:08:10,985
And if you think back, in ancient times,
actually all of us were entrepreneurs,

174
00:08:10,985 --> 00:08:13,659
there were not such things
like large organizations or governments

175
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,746
we could work for:

176
00:08:14,746 --> 00:08:17,502
so entrepreneurship is in a way in us.

177
00:08:17,502 --> 00:08:20,573
But you need to find out
that it's actually so much in you

178
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:22,977
that you want to engage in this activity.

179
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:25,625
So think about, you know, in Tiger Woods.

180
00:08:25,626 --> 00:08:29,212
If he hadn't had a golf club, 
he would have never understood

181
00:08:29,212 --> 00:08:31,436
that this is actually a sport
that he can do.

182
00:08:31,436 --> 00:08:33,585
We're in Switzerland
so think about Roger Federer.

183
00:08:33,606 --> 00:08:37,359
- If he didn't pick up a tennis racket--
- He would have never known!

184
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:42,477
So in that sense we really invite you
to also experience entrepreneurship

185
00:08:42,477 --> 00:08:44,528
in all these stages, learn about it,

186
00:08:44,529 --> 00:08:48,326
and ultimately try to understand
is this an activity that is fun to you,

187
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,864
it fulfills your life,
and is a career choice.

188
00:08:50,876 --> 00:08:55,022
So there are some practicalities
for participating in the MOOC,

189
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:59,334
and Nethra is going to walk you through
those in more detail later this week.

190
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,792
But just to give you
the overview of that aspect of it,

191
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:06,551
there is going to be participation
in assignments, quizzes,

192
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:09,058
we have online fora
that you can post questions.

193
00:09:09,059 --> 00:09:11,382
We also have Q&A sessions each week.

194
00:09:11,383 --> 00:09:14,930
We probably cannot answer
all the questions you Tweet to us

195
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:17,821
or you post in the fora because
there could be many questions,

196
00:09:17,821 --> 00:09:20,865
but, from our experience, they cluster
around some particular topics

197
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:24,031
and we will be discussing these topics
with you during these weeks.

198
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,604
So, we'll participate
in online office hours,

199
00:09:26,604 --> 00:09:29,375
and we will create panels 
that are tailored

200
00:09:29,417 --> 00:09:32,876
to the discussions that we are having
and the questions that we are receiving.

201
00:09:32,877 --> 00:09:35,380
In addition to that, we are also
going to have you develop,

202
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,563
as we mentioned before,

203
00:09:36,563 --> 00:09:38,001
a business concept proposal,

204
00:09:38,001 --> 00:09:40,424
and as Marc just mentioned recently,

205
00:09:40,424 --> 00:09:42,760
there's going to be
a crowdfunding campaign.

206
00:09:42,821 --> 00:09:46,062
So, this is what this course is about,
we decided for you,

207
00:09:46,063 --> 00:09:48,550
we look forward to being with you
in the next five weeks,

208
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:49,823
so welcome!

209
00:09:49,823 --> 00:09:50,703
- Welcome!
