1
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:11,369
So welcome back!
This is week three,

2
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:12,974
<i>Entrepreneurial Marketing</i>,

3
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:16,239
and during this week you're going to hear
about developing strategies

4
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:18,514
that make your marketing work,

5
00:00:18,515 --> 00:00:20,896
that will help your company to grow,

6
00:00:20,897 --> 00:00:23,586
and that will help your firm
to get traction in the marketplace,

7
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:28,376
i. e. you are on the way to establishing
a healthy, viable new business.

8
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:31,173
There are a couple of issues
that we will be discussing this week

9
00:00:31,174 --> 00:00:35,039
but the first segment discusses, probably
one of the most important elements,

10
00:00:35,128 --> 00:00:37,707
which is the development
of your marketing strategy.

11
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:41,905
The development of your marketing strategy
is one of the core strategic activities

12
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:44,383
that you engage in
during the firm creation process.

13
00:00:44,384 --> 00:00:49,962
Let's remember that the market,
i.e. the customers in that market,

14
00:00:49,963 --> 00:00:52,992
will ultimately pay
for your company creation,

15
00:00:52,993 --> 00:00:55,822
and because they like your product,
they will pay for your product

16
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:58,779
and that money will come
into your company as cashflow.

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:01,686
When you think about developing
a marketing strategy,

18
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:04,248
one of the core elements
that you need to decide upon

19
00:01:04,248 --> 00:01:07,291
is the target market segment
that you want to address,

20
00:01:07,292 --> 00:01:09,933
and the other core element
that you want to decide upon

21
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:12,627
is how that target segment
should perceive your product

22
00:01:12,628 --> 00:01:15,124
vis-รก-vis the competitor's product.

23
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:19,397
Let's go back to what we discussed
in the introductory segment to this week

24
00:01:19,398 --> 00:01:21,258
on <i>Entrepreneurial Marketing</i>,

25
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:23,954
where we gave you a systematic framework,

26
00:01:23,955 --> 00:01:26,327
so let me remind you about the framework

27
00:01:26,328 --> 00:01:28,665
and then show you what we
will be doing in this segment.

28
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,478
The fundamentals are the following:

29
00:01:38,561 --> 00:01:40,749
Building on that basis you can then decide

30
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:44,598
which target segments get
the most benefit from your product,

31
00:01:44,599 --> 00:01:48,754
and also how those customers
in this target segment

32
00:01:48,755 --> 00:01:51,154
should perceive your company.

33
00:01:51,155 --> 00:01:56,513
The second element would be
the strategic element.

34
00:01:57,481 --> 00:02:02,330
It means, how should I be positioned,
what is my target market.

35
00:02:12,214 --> 00:02:16,453
We call this the segmentation decision
and the positioning decision,

36
00:02:16,454 --> 00:02:19,856
and as I mentioned,
these are two core, strategic decisions

37
00:02:19,857 --> 00:02:24,150
that you engage in during the development
of your marketing strategy.

38
00:02:34,142 --> 00:02:36,170
Based on these two
core strategic decisions

39
00:02:36,171 --> 00:02:39,635
you will be able to decide
upon a whole range of other issues

40
00:02:39,636 --> 00:02:41,725
that are more operational,

41
00:02:41,726 --> 00:02:45,049
that are in the implementation phase
of your marketing strategy.

42
00:02:45,222 --> 00:02:49,036
Some of you might have heard
of the well-known marketing mix.

43
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:52,576
Exactly those elements would be
the more operational ones,

44
00:02:52,577 --> 00:02:54,404
the implementation issues.

45
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:10,386
So, it's the marketing mix
and the implementation that follows.

46
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:17,241
What we will be discussing
are the Seven P's

47
00:03:17,242 --> 00:03:18,877
which are an extension of the Four P's

48
00:03:18,878 --> 00:03:21,864
with a special consideration
about the service industry

49
00:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,288
and a couple
of the implementation issues

50
00:03:24,289 --> 00:03:25,943
like Guerrilla Marketing, etc.

51
00:03:25,944 --> 00:03:28,517
But one thing is core:
you need to understand the difference

52
00:03:28,518 --> 00:03:33,011
between the strategic elements
and the implementation elements.

53
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,796
This is something that many entrepreneurs
do, unfortunately, not get right,

54
00:03:36,797 --> 00:03:41,284
and then have to adjust and readjust
their market implementation.

55
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:45,281
So when we think about marketing,
really keep this in mind,

56
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:46,847
that there is a strategic level to it,

57
00:03:46,848 --> 00:03:49,821
and there is a more implementation
operational level to it.

58
00:03:49,822 --> 00:03:51,835
The first element
that you need to understand

59
00:03:51,836 --> 00:03:54,686
is the firm's distinctive competence.

60
00:03:55,279 --> 00:03:56,851
Why is this important?

61
00:03:56,852 --> 00:04:01,015
Because the firm's distinctive competence
allows you to establish advantage

62
00:04:01,016 --> 00:04:02,788
vis-รก-vis the competition.

63
00:04:02,789 --> 00:04:05,678
There must be something that you're
really, really good at in your company.

64
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:07,637
Think about your own competences.

65
00:04:07,638 --> 00:04:12,707
If you, as a person,
are applying for a job out there,

66
00:04:12,708 --> 00:04:16,986
you need to be special, you need
to have some competences

67
00:04:16,987 --> 00:04:20,516
that other people who apply
for this job actually do not have,

68
00:04:20,517 --> 00:04:22,280
so that you get that job,

69
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:24,959
and the same logic applies
in firm creation as well.

70
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,902
You need to find out
what your company is really good at,

71
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,276
produce products that embody
that great skill, capability,

72
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,375
and then you have something
to provide to the market

73
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,882
where the customer will say,
"Wow, that is a great product!

74
00:04:38,883 --> 00:04:40,992
That's a great offering,

75
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:45,981
and I choose yours vis-รก-vis
the competition's offering."

76
00:04:45,982 --> 00:04:48,484
So in that sense, the firm's core

77
00:04:48,485 --> 00:04:51,928
of this competitive advantage
issue that it relates to

78
00:04:51,929 --> 00:04:54,238
is something that you need to address,

79
00:04:54,239 --> 00:04:57,059
and you need to understand
early on in your venture's creation.

80
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,998
When we think about
distinctive competences,

81
00:04:58,999 --> 00:05:00,411
it can be multiple things.

82
00:05:00,412 --> 00:05:03,049
In a high-tech venture
it's typically the technology,

83
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,639
which is innovative, novel,
and has aspects to it

84
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:11,690
that render services
that other technologies cannot render.

85
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:17,908
But it can also be excellent design,
high quality, customer service.

86
00:05:17,909 --> 00:05:20,264
Typically, when we look
at the successful startups,

87
00:05:20,265 --> 00:05:23,997
it's a mix of all these elements,
and even more elements.

88
00:05:23,998 --> 00:05:25,842
Why is this the case?

89
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:31,237
Because other firms, your competitors,
will have a hard time copying you,

90
00:05:31,238 --> 00:05:33,077
imitating what you're doing

91
00:05:33,078 --> 00:05:37,642
if your competitive advantage
relies on so many ingredients.

92
00:05:38,882 --> 00:05:41,499
It's just harder to observe
what you are doing,

93
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,175
and it's just harder to imitate,

94
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:47,186
so once you have a bundle
of competences that you build on,

95
00:05:47,946 --> 00:05:53,424
you actually have quite a leg forward
relative to the competition.

96
00:05:53,425 --> 00:05:54,740
This understanding

97
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:57,662
of your distinctive competences
and your competitive advantage

98
00:05:57,663 --> 00:06:02,257
will actually form the basis
for all subsequent marketing decisions,

99
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:07,519
the core ones, the strategic ones,
and the more operational ones,

100
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:09,863
the implementation issues
that we discussed before.

101
00:06:09,864 --> 00:06:12,212
The segmentation decision
answers the question,

102
00:06:12,213 --> 00:06:13,914
"Which is my target market?"

103
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:16,673
while the positioning decision
answers the question,

104
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:20,437
"Why will someone in the target market
buy my product or service

105
00:06:20,438 --> 00:06:22,078
instead of the competition's?"

106
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:26,364
So you really see how those segmentation
and positioning decisions

107
00:06:26,365 --> 00:06:28,618
are two sides of the same coin.

108
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:30,838
That's why they should be
determined jointly.

109
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:34,332
Let's look at them in more detail
to make you understand what they entail.

110
00:06:34,615 --> 00:06:36,350
Let's start with segmentation.

111
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:38,626
Entrepreneurs typically
only serve one segment.

112
00:06:38,627 --> 00:06:42,461
This is because they have
limited resources, limited attention.

113
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:48,031
Some entrepreneurs might decide to say,
"I enter multiple segments at once,"

114
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:51,985
but this can only be done if there is
some strong synergy between the segments.

115
00:06:51,986 --> 00:06:54,813
Typically, you focus on one segment

116
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,784
and this segment deserves
your full attention,

117
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:02,203
because there are
customer requests from the segment.

118
00:07:02,204 --> 00:07:06,024
You want to enter the segment successfully
and create happy customers

119
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,020
that are talking about your product
in a favorable way,

120
00:07:09,021 --> 00:07:10,807
so you create word-of-mouth.

121
00:07:10,808 --> 00:07:14,663
The central question in segmentation is
"Who are my customers?"

122
00:07:15,763 --> 00:07:18,828
Building on that question
you have a couple of additional questions

123
00:07:18,829 --> 00:07:22,459
that you need to check
and to answer in order to understand

124
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:26,382
whether that segment that you have chosen
is actually a good one, OK?

125
00:07:26,389 --> 00:07:32,967
The first question is hinting this notion
that positioning and segmentation

126
00:07:32,968 --> 00:07:36,976
are two closely related decisions
that should be jointly developed

127
00:07:36,977 --> 00:07:38,617
because it asks you,

128
00:07:38,618 --> 00:07:40,985
"Is the perceived benefit
that my positioning targets

129
00:07:40,986 --> 00:07:43,908
matching the benefits desired
by this customer segment?"

130
00:07:44,503 --> 00:07:46,911
So, there needs to be an alignment.

131
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:51,209
Another key question is
"How quickly can I reach a segment?"

132
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,688
What's the size and purchasing
power of this segment,

133
00:07:53,689 --> 00:07:57,799
and if you look across time,
are there possible changes in this segment

134
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,814
that may affect purchasing power
and other attributes of the segment,

135
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,441
i. e., could make it more
or less attractive to you?

136
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:07,309
Finally, you may also want to think

137
00:08:07,310 --> 00:08:10,650
about the competitors' activities
in this segment.

138
00:08:10,651 --> 00:08:13,666
Here's a checklist
for successful segmentation.

139
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:16,853
A successful segmentation should be one

140
00:08:16,854 --> 00:08:21,093
where there's homogeneity
of needs and wants within the segment,

141
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:24,784
and there's heterogeneity
of needs and wants between segments.

142
00:08:24,785 --> 00:08:27,641
This picture is actually
quite telling in that sense,

143
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:32,104
because you see three people here,
all wear a red sweater,

144
00:08:32,105 --> 00:08:35,241
all have white glasses on,
they have the same beard,

145
00:08:35,241 --> 00:08:37,623
and the same hairstyle,
and even the same smile.

146
00:08:37,624 --> 00:08:39,309
They might be triplets,

147
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:43,014
but I think they Photoshopped
the same person three times.

148
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:47,230
So in that sense, what is interesting

149
00:08:47,231 --> 00:08:49,555
is that if you are,
from a company's perspective,

150
00:08:49,556 --> 00:08:52,381
looking at this segment here,
these types of people,

151
00:08:52,382 --> 00:08:56,644
you will say, "OK, I exactly know
what they need, what they want,

152
00:08:56,645 --> 00:08:59,120
it's homogeneous, it's the same."

153
00:08:59,121 --> 00:09:02,139
That provides you with some ability
to send a marketing message

154
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,553
so this is very targeted,
because you know what they need.

155
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:08,208
If these would be now
different types of people,

156
00:09:08,908 --> 00:09:12,256
one wearing a blue sweater,
another wearing a green sweater,

157
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:14,190
you would have
a much harder time in saying,

158
00:09:14,191 --> 00:09:18,239
"OK, do I actually fulfill
the needs of these people?"

159
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,133
They might actually come back
to you and one might say,

160
00:09:21,134 --> 00:09:26,452
"I need a product that is
different in shape and design."

161
00:09:26,453 --> 00:09:28,377
Another one needs another type of product,

162
00:09:28,378 --> 00:09:31,562
so that will kill you
in terms of complexity.

163
00:09:32,742 --> 00:09:38,750
A good segment should thus have
few differences within the segment,

164
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:41,481
and large differences to other segments.

165
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:45,785
You should also be able
to determine the size of the segment.

166
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:47,934
If you cannot determine
the size of the segment,

167
00:09:47,935 --> 00:09:52,145
it's typically an indication
that you did not segment well enough.

168
00:09:53,335 --> 00:09:55,643
And ultimately, the segment
should be large enough

169
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:58,279
so that you can be
profitable as a company.

170
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:01,774
These elements
provide you with a checklist,

171
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:06,189
but I think, fundamentally, try to think
of benefits that you will establish

172
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,101
by saying, "This is my target market,
I know who these people are,

173
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:13,793
I know which type of marketing
messages appeal to them,"

174
00:10:13,794 --> 00:10:17,354
because once you can say this,
these people will come back and say,

175
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:22,242
"Wow! I was addressed with my needs
through your marketing messages.

176
00:10:22,243 --> 00:10:24,103
Let me get your product."

177
00:10:24,104 --> 00:10:28,026
An interesting sample of segmentation
is the mobile phone market.

178
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:32,500
Many factors play into
the segmentation decision in this market.

179
00:10:32,501 --> 00:10:35,043
For instance, psychographic
and lifestyle considerations,

180
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:40,617
consumer behavior as the most
sophisticated ways of segmenting a market,

181
00:10:40,897 --> 00:10:43,531
but also geographic
and demographic characteristics

182
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,103
such as age, gender,
family size, etcetera.

183
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,158
So let's just look
at these different pictures

184
00:10:48,159 --> 00:10:52,555
that people could use
to market different phones.

185
00:10:52,556 --> 00:10:54,787
This already tells you
which types of market segments

186
00:10:54,788 --> 00:10:58,345
these phones are attempting to address.

187
00:10:58,346 --> 00:10:59,944
Look to the left side.

188
00:10:59,945 --> 00:11:01,514
There is, for instance, the Blackberry

189
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:04,637
which used to be a business phone
for business people.

190
00:11:04,638 --> 00:11:09,101
That target segment was
specifically designed that way.

191
00:11:09,991 --> 00:11:14,498
Nowadays, Blackberry tries to
relaunch itself as a money sending device.

192
00:11:14,501 --> 00:11:17,810
That could be a strategy
that Blackberry could adopt.

193
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:20,343
Ultimately, you need to choose criteria

194
00:11:20,344 --> 00:11:23,583
that will allow you to have
an interesting understanding,

195
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:27,570
a very deep understanding
of your target market.

196
00:11:27,571 --> 00:11:31,042
The decision that has to be taken
in parallel to the segmentation decision

197
00:11:31,043 --> 00:11:33,225
is the positioning decision.

198
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,943
Positioning is so important,

199
00:11:35,944 --> 00:11:40,300
as it portrays how the customers
should perceive your product,

200
00:11:40,301 --> 00:11:42,660
your company vis-รก-vis the competition,

201
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:44,637
and especially when you think
about new firms.

202
00:11:44,638 --> 00:11:48,707
These are unknown entities in new
and innovative markets, oftentimes,

203
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:51,247
so that customers
should actually understand

204
00:11:51,248 --> 00:11:53,612
the unique attributes of that company,

205
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:56,407
and that relates back
to what we have been already discussing

206
00:11:56,408 --> 00:11:59,141
with regards to the competitive
advantage question

207
00:11:59,142 --> 00:12:02,824
and the core competence question
at the beginning of this segment.

208
00:12:02,825 --> 00:12:05,013
So, the central question is

209
00:12:05,014 --> 00:12:08,639
"What are the unique differentiating
characteristics of my product or service

210
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:12,593
as perceived by members
of the target segment?"

211
00:12:12,594 --> 00:12:15,873
There are a couple of further questions
that you will need to understand

212
00:12:15,874 --> 00:12:20,901
in order to provide and develop
a compelling positioning.

213
00:12:21,862 --> 00:12:25,110
The first question here
is a very relevant one.

214
00:12:25,111 --> 00:12:28,929
It says, "Why should my product service
be bought instead of the competitors'?"

215
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:34,097
We mentioned this issue briefly
in the previous module,

216
00:12:34,098 --> 00:12:36,829
when we talked about putting yourself
in the customer's shoes.

217
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,821
This is exactly what it means here.

218
00:12:39,301 --> 00:12:40,574
Try to understand

219
00:12:41,214 --> 00:12:45,793
why my customer should choose my product

220
00:12:45,794 --> 00:12:47,707
and not the competitors' product.

221
00:12:48,877 --> 00:12:51,122
This relates then to the second question,

222
00:12:51,123 --> 00:12:54,616
"Which differentiating characteristics
should my target segment perceive?"

223
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:57,333
This might sound like a trivial question,

224
00:12:57,334 --> 00:13:01,762
but for most innovations,
it's not a trivial question.

225
00:13:01,763 --> 00:13:04,912
This is because you have
lots of features in a product

226
00:13:04,913 --> 00:13:09,404
and you need to understand which features
you should actually put to the forefront

227
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:11,688
when you communicate with the customer

228
00:13:11,689 --> 00:13:14,165
so that he can perceive those features.

229
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:20,435
It's not a trivial question
because it actually could turn out to lead

230
00:13:20,436 --> 00:13:24,000
to insights like the one where you say,

231
00:13:24,001 --> 00:13:27,012
"OK, this is not a segment
that actually values my product."

232
00:13:27,013 --> 00:13:29,814
So you go back
to the drawing board and say,

233
00:13:29,815 --> 00:13:34,504
"OK, maybe this target segment
is not fitting my positioning

234
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:39,159
or the type of benefits
that I want to render to the segment."

235
00:13:39,899 --> 00:13:42,498
Here's an example
of a positioning in the auto market.

236
00:13:42,499 --> 00:13:45,749
In the auto market, oftentimes
customers perceive cars

237
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:49,897
as either being sporty
or more conservative,

238
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:55,418
and they perceive cars
as either being classy and distinctive,

239
00:13:55,948 --> 00:13:57,627
or practical and affordable.

240
00:13:58,597 --> 00:14:00,120
If we have that positioning cross,

241
00:14:00,121 --> 00:14:04,700
you can then start to put all kinds
of brands of car companies in there

242
00:14:04,701 --> 00:14:08,496
and try to understand
how they are perceived by customers.

243
00:14:09,526 --> 00:14:13,371
For instance, if we are in the
sporty/classy & distinctive quadrant here,

244
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:18,593
you have companies like BMW,
Audi, Porsche, and for instance, Tesla.

245
00:14:19,673 --> 00:14:22,490
When we are in the quadrant
that is more conservative

246
00:14:22,491 --> 00:14:24,776
and practical & affordable,
t1his one down here,

247
00:14:24,777 --> 00:14:28,018
we would have companies
like Plymouth, Dodge, and Ford.

248
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:32,386
Then again, you have the other quadrants.
I don't walk you through those.

249
00:14:33,963 --> 00:14:38,429
Let's just remember that this is how
the customers perceive the auto market.

250
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,605
It's really standing
in the customers' shoes.

251
00:14:41,606 --> 00:14:43,296
For you as an entrepreneur,

252
00:14:43,297 --> 00:14:48,163
this is actually quite an interesting type
of strategic decision making process here

253
00:14:48,164 --> 00:14:51,339
because it allows you
to understand a couple of issues

254
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,040
that are core to your marketing.

255
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:57,322
First, it allows you to understand
where the blank spots,

256
00:14:57,323 --> 00:15:00,150
where there is no competition,

257
00:15:00,151 --> 00:15:04,485
for instance, here, here,
and also here.

258
00:15:04,486 --> 00:15:06,487
The question then is
"Is this target segment

259
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,305
that would be reflecting
this type of positioning

260
00:15:09,306 --> 00:15:11,678
still an attractive one?

261
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:13,993
It also allows you to understand,

262
00:15:13,994 --> 00:15:19,007
if you are positioned that way,
as a new company,

263
00:15:19,008 --> 00:15:20,901
who are my direct competitors?

264
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:25,787
Here it would be Tesla, Audi, Porsche,
but maybe also Pontiac.

265
00:15:27,507 --> 00:15:31,274
In the customers' mind, these companies
would be closely together,

266
00:15:31,275 --> 00:15:33,173
so in that sense, these would be the ones

267
00:15:33,174 --> 00:15:36,484
you want to differentiate
yourself most from.

268
00:15:36,485 --> 00:15:39,329
But this also allows you to actually say,

269
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:43,549
"OK, I do an analysis
where we do not use

270
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:48,078
the classical dimensions
of how the car market is segmented

271
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:51,328
- sporty versus conservative
and classy versus distinctive -

272
00:15:51,329 --> 00:15:54,668
but I actually adopt
a new type of dimension

273
00:15:54,669 --> 00:15:57,643
and try to understand how
the segmentation and the positioning

274
00:15:57,644 --> 00:16:00,043
would look with
this new type of dimension."

275
00:16:00,044 --> 00:16:01,492
So think about Tesla.

276
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:05,269
They are a company that produces
energy efficient cars.

277
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:10,727
They could actually say, "The car market
is moving into another direction.

278
00:16:10,728 --> 00:16:14,775
It's no longer that these
two classical dimensions are used

279
00:16:14,776 --> 00:16:17,567
in order to understand customer choices.

280
00:16:17,568 --> 00:16:21,686
There's a new dimension coming in,
it's energy efficiency."

281
00:16:21,687 --> 00:16:25,466
So there is high and low
on energy efficiency on one axis,

282
00:16:25,467 --> 00:16:27,783
could say, instead of conservative/sporty,

283
00:16:27,784 --> 00:16:33,284
could say low and high energy efficiency.

284
00:16:34,434 --> 00:16:37,102
Tesla would come out ahead,
and then you could say,

285
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:41,930
"Where would all the other companies
now be relative to Tesla?"

286
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:46,373
This would provide you with
a novel insight into the market.

287
00:16:46,374 --> 00:16:48,640
What's the interesting thing
then for entrepreneurs

288
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,093
is that by introducing new technologies,

289
00:16:51,094 --> 00:16:55,075
by providing customers
with unique, new benefits,

290
00:16:55,076 --> 00:17:00,475
you will have and could have
the chance to redefine the markets

291
00:17:00,476 --> 00:17:03,078
in a way that Tesla is doing right now,

292
00:17:03,186 --> 00:17:06,269
and several other companies
are trying to do now.

293
00:17:06,914 --> 00:17:08,608
So your positioning, in other words,

294
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:11,435
has to be based
on some unique characteristics,

295
00:17:11,436 --> 00:17:14,521
and these unique characteristics
should be clearly visible

296
00:17:14,522 --> 00:17:17,704
or relevant to that segment
and easy to remember.

297
00:17:17,705 --> 00:17:22,614
So the focus should be on
a couple of important characteristics.

298
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:24,516
Few important characteristics.

299
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:28,109
Don't spread yourself too broadly here
with lots of characteristics

300
00:17:28,111 --> 00:17:30,582
because the customer will have
a difficult time understanding

301
00:17:30,583 --> 00:17:34,091
what your product is
and how it relates to the competition.

302
00:17:34,544 --> 00:17:36,450
What you also need to bear in mind

303
00:17:36,451 --> 00:17:39,083
is that customers don't buy features,
they buy benefits,

304
00:17:40,143 --> 00:17:43,679
so high quality technical features
are not enough.

305
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:48,545
Regardless of the real benefit, it's only
the benefit that customers perceive

306
00:17:48,546 --> 00:17:53,208
that matters most for the buying decision,
for the purchasing decision.

307
00:17:53,209 --> 00:17:55,228
But ultimately, it's the real benefit

308
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:59,036
that then they will experience
when using your product

309
00:17:59,037 --> 00:18:03,557
that will tell them, "Shall I be
happy about this purchase?

310
00:18:03,767 --> 00:18:08,656
Shall I be disappointed?
Shall I recommend this product to others?"

311
00:18:08,657 --> 00:18:12,186
In other words, will they engage
in positive word of mouth

312
00:18:12,187 --> 00:18:15,492
or negative word of mouth
regarding your product?

313
00:18:15,493 --> 00:18:18,165
Let me give you some intuition
about what it means

314
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,802
when I say "customers buy benefits'".

315
00:18:20,803 --> 00:18:25,459
You all know, or many of you know
the Kindle reader from Amazon.

316
00:18:25,460 --> 00:18:30,272
This is a technical device
you could describe in technical details.

317
00:18:30,273 --> 00:18:33,139
It has a certain size,
it has a certain weight,

318
00:18:33,140 --> 00:18:37,801
it has a certain resolution
on the screen, etcetera.

319
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:42,642
Is the customer caring
about these features?

320
00:18:43,842 --> 00:18:48,208
He does so, but only to the extent
that they can render a benefit to him,

321
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:52,574
so let's look at this advertising
that Amazon actually has put out.

322
00:18:52,575 --> 00:18:54,858
They say it's perfect for reading.

323
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:58,588
It reads like real paper and no glare
even in bright sunlight.

324
00:18:58,589 --> 00:19:01,641
They say it's lighter than a paperback.

325
00:19:01,642 --> 00:19:03,980
They say it has a one-month life battery.

326
00:19:03,998 --> 00:19:07,265
They say it has sharp, clear text,
it's easy on the eyes,

327
00:19:07,266 --> 00:19:09,291
and you can read in any position.

328
00:19:09,292 --> 00:19:13,907
That's basically your perspective,
as a reader, that Amazon is adopting.

329
00:19:13,908 --> 00:19:18,420
They are describing the technical features
of the product in a way

330
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:21,392
that the customer will understand
what type of benefits

331
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:24,003
these technical features
will render to them.

332
00:19:24,004 --> 00:19:26,477
They select a few of these characteristics

333
00:19:26,478 --> 00:19:28,882
so that you will ultimately
get an understanding

334
00:19:28,883 --> 00:19:31,423
that this is really perfect for reading.

335
00:19:31,424 --> 00:19:34,342
This said, there may also be
segments out there

336
00:19:34,343 --> 00:19:39,742
that actually value technical description
above anything else.

337
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:44,077
Understanding your target segment
means also to understand,

338
00:19:44,078 --> 00:19:48,734
do they prefer
customer benefit explanation,

339
00:19:48,735 --> 00:19:52,971
of the type that I just explained
with the Amazon example,

340
00:19:52,972 --> 00:19:55,355
or would they prefer
a more technical description,

341
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:59,126
where they would say,
"everything else is blah, blah, blah.

342
00:19:59,127 --> 00:20:01,291
We want the hard facts."

343
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:04,834
So, as an example, consider
Lenovo's online notebook store.

344
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:07,436
This is definitely a store
that is addressing

345
00:20:07,437 --> 00:20:12,058
the more technologically savvy consumer,
buyer of notebooks

346
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:14,920
because it walks you through
a couple of questions.

347
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:17,650
These are mostly technical questions,

348
00:20:17,651 --> 00:20:20,735
so that you can understand
which type of PC you need.

349
00:20:20,736 --> 00:20:26,028
You need to select
between the primary use of your computer,

350
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:28,397
what type of computer you're looking for,

351
00:20:28,398 --> 00:20:31,970
what features are important for you,
and what price you are willing to spend.

352
00:20:31,971 --> 00:20:36,655
Then Lenovo provides you with some
examples of computers that fit your needs.

353
00:20:37,179 --> 00:20:42,383
This is a fairly different way of asking
and pointing out the features

354
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:46,657
compared to the more benefit-driven
explanations that we have just seen

355
00:20:46,658 --> 00:20:48,614
with the Amazon Kindle example.

356
00:20:48,615 --> 00:20:52,279
So coming to the end of this segment
on developing your marketing strategy,

357
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,328
there are a couple of key issues
that I want you to remember.

358
00:20:55,329 --> 00:21:00,600
First, we have seen that there are
fundamental decisions

359
00:21:00,601 --> 00:21:04,002
regarding the competences
that you have in a company

360
00:21:04,003 --> 00:21:07,957
that will form the basis
for making all subsequent decisions.

361
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,876
These are core
strategic marketing decisions

362
00:21:10,877 --> 00:21:14,609
that build on this understanding
of what your distinctive competence is,

363
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:18,048
other decisions regarding
your segmentation,

364
00:21:18,049 --> 00:21:21,999
and other decisions regarding
your positioning of your company.

365
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,774
These decisions are core

366
00:21:24,775 --> 00:21:27,541
to everything else
you will be doing in marketing,

367
00:21:27,542 --> 00:21:30,724
especially the implementation
of your marketing plan

368
00:21:30,725 --> 00:21:36,534
which then entails distribution decisions,
advertising decisions, because ultimately,

369
00:21:36,535 --> 00:21:39,583
if you do not have a clear idea
who your target customers are,

370
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:41,698
if you do not have a clear idea about how

371
00:21:41,699 --> 00:21:44,098
your target customers
should perceive your company,

372
00:21:44,099 --> 00:21:46,024
you will have an incredibly hard time

373
00:21:46,025 --> 00:21:48,745
understanding which type of distribution,

374
00:21:48,746 --> 00:21:52,210
which type of advertising
you should engage in.

375
00:21:52,851 --> 00:21:56,679
So in that sense, keep in mind
that there are core strategic decisions

376
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,414
that you need to engage in,

377
00:21:58,415 --> 00:22:01,845
and then only can you come
to the implementation part

378
00:22:01,846 --> 00:22:03,293
of your marketing plan.

379
00:22:03,294 --> 00:22:04,914
In this sense, see you next time.
