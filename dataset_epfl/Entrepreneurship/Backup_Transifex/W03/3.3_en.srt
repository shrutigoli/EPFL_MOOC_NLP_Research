1
00:00:04,267 --> 00:00:05,497
Welcome back.

2
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:07,985
This is week three, still,
Entrepreneurial Marketing,

3
00:00:07,985 --> 00:00:11,329
and today we’re going to talk
about value propositions.

4
00:00:11,329 --> 00:00:14,171
We tie together the insights 
that we discussed

5
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:16,066
in the previous modules,

6
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:18,715
which was about understanding
your customers,

7
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:20,529
understanding your competition.

8
00:00:20,529 --> 00:00:21,388
With these insights,

9
00:00:21,388 --> 00:00:25,263
you actually have the right ingredients 
in place to,

10
00:00:25,263 --> 00:00:27,568
draft a compelling value proposition here.

11
00:00:27,568 --> 00:00:30,052
Most of you have heard
of the term “value proposition”,

12
00:00:30,052 --> 00:00:32,263
but let’s bring us all
on the same page

13
00:00:32,263 --> 00:00:35,295
and try to understand
what a compelling value proposition is,

14
00:00:35,295 --> 00:00:37,184
how you can formulate one,

15
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:40,536
and what type of information
you might still have to collect

16
00:00:40,536 --> 00:00:43,618
in order to sharpen your ideas
about your value proposition.

17
00:00:43,848 --> 00:00:47,760
So your value proposition
is the collection of reasons

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,366
why a person or a company benefits

19
00:00:50,366 --> 00:00:53,270
from buying your product
or a service.

20
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:55,800
So it’s your promise
of performance and value.

21
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,328
It is expressed, typically,
in a short statement

22
00:00:59,328 --> 00:01:01,663
that is aimed at creating,
occupying a space

23
00:01:01,663 --> 00:01:03,346
in your customers’ mind.

24
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:04,928
And it conveys the message,

25
00:01:04,928 --> 00:01:08,153
“It’s the best buy
for this type of problem.”

26
00:01:08,403 --> 00:01:11,778
So it’s really an element,
a message

27
00:01:11,778 --> 00:01:16,083
that combines the competition
and your customer insights.

28
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,094
In order to create
and occupy such a space

29
00:01:18,094 --> 00:01:19,119
in your customers’ mind,

30
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:21,143
your value proposition
must be compelling.

31
00:01:21,923 --> 00:01:23,783
It must resonate with the customer.

32
00:01:24,103 --> 00:01:25,903
And it must be differentiated.

33
00:01:25,903 --> 00:01:27,850
So what does this mean
to be compelling?

34
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:29,534
It needs to provide key attributes

35
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:31,995
to the targeted customers,
so to speak,

36
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:34,301
the customer value drivers.

37
00:01:34,901 --> 00:01:36,705
And it should,
in order to be differentiated,

38
00:01:36,705 --> 00:01:39,557
it needs to clearly state
how the key attributes

39
00:01:39,557 --> 00:01:43,038
of your offering are <i>better</i>
than the ones of your competitors.

40
00:01:43,038 --> 00:01:46,864
So, the competition
<i>and</i> the customer insights

41
00:01:46,864 --> 00:01:49,257
that you have collected are
of vital importance

42
00:01:49,257 --> 00:01:51,698
in developing
a compelling value proposition.

43
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:53,875
So a value proposition can come
in many forms,

44
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:57,275
but in my experience, the content
of a good value proposition

45
00:01:57,275 --> 00:01:59,884
can be stated
in one clear-cut sentence.

46
00:01:59,884 --> 00:02:02,962
And this is the sentence I share
on this slide with you.

47
00:02:02,962 --> 00:02:05,743
It’s a [inaudible],
it looks like a simple sentence,

48
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:08,825
but it in fact, you know,
it will take you quite a bit of time

49
00:02:08,825 --> 00:02:11,932
to <i>really, really</i> draft it
and phrase it

50
00:02:11,932 --> 00:02:13,991
in a way that it’s compelling.

51
00:02:13,991 --> 00:02:16,893
It says,
“As a result of our <i>offerings</i>,

52
00:02:16,893 --> 00:02:19,170
customers with a certain <i>profile</i>,

53
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,490
who are facing <i>some kind
of compelling reason to act</i>,

54
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:25,821
"will <i>do, experience something</i>,

55
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:28,055
for a <i>cost that they face</i>

56
00:02:28,055 --> 00:02:31,388
and enjoy <i>some benefits,
some return</i>,

57
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:33,924
<i>within or by a certain time</i>,

58
00:02:33,924 --> 00:02:36,455
"compared to <i>some alternatives</i>.”

59
00:02:36,455 --> 00:02:38,502
You know, you can name
the alternates here.

60
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:41,323
“The advantages of using our offerings
are <i>bing, bing, bing</i>.”

61
00:02:41,323 --> 00:02:45,200
So, this one sentence--
it’s a long sentence, granted--

62
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,504
but this one sentence
can give you the ability

63
00:02:48,504 --> 00:02:52,409
to put very succinctly
what your company is about.

64
00:02:52,409 --> 00:02:54,534
And, for some of you,

65
00:02:54,534 --> 00:02:58,449
this might be looking like
a simple sentence to draft, you know.

66
00:02:58,449 --> 00:03:00,735
But please do it,
it’s so of vital importance,

67
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:05,846
and you will realize, well,
to find a compelling way to put it.

68
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:10,021
It’s not so straightforward,
you know, so I've typically--

69
00:03:10,021 --> 00:03:12,811
the teams that I consult to
and work with,

70
00:03:12,811 --> 00:03:14,565
it takes them a couple of hours

71
00:03:14,565 --> 00:03:16,827
in order to come up 
with this sentence.

72
00:03:16,827 --> 00:03:19,060
And then there’s over time,

73
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:21,648
even some honing
and some fine tuning

74
00:03:21,648 --> 00:03:22,842
on the sentence.

75
00:03:22,842 --> 00:03:25,100
Because ultimately,
if you can phrase that sentence,

76
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,396
you’ve understood, also,

77
00:03:26,396 --> 00:03:30,007
why you should be successful
vis-a-vis the competition.

78
00:03:30,007 --> 00:03:32,420
This will help you 
in talking to customers.

79
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:34,847
This will help you even 
to talk to investors,

80
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,055
because the investors

81
00:03:36,055 --> 00:03:39,386
will get a good understanding
that you are—

82
00:03:39,386 --> 00:03:42,400
have command of your venture
and know what you do.

83
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:44,344
So of course, when you look 
at this sentence,

84
00:03:44,344 --> 00:03:48,255
there are a couple of elements
that you may or may not know yet.

85
00:03:48,835 --> 00:03:51,720
So, I’ve drafted this little table here,

86
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,893
to help you understand what type 
of elements I still need

87
00:03:54,893 --> 00:03:56,159
to do research on,

88
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,485
and what type
of elements you can say,

89
00:03:58,485 --> 00:04:01,632
“I already have sufficient
information on here.”

90
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:03,265
So let’s quickly look at this.

91
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:04,725
So there are two columns.

92
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:08,337
One is facts that you know,
evidence that you actually have.

93
00:04:08,337 --> 00:04:10,220
And then there’s assumptions.

94
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,552
It oftentimes,
just as a footnote here,

95
00:04:12,552 --> 00:04:14,201
you start your entrepreneurial journey

96
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:15,667
with lots of assumptions,
you know,

97
00:04:15,667 --> 00:04:18,295
and over time,
you’re collecting information,

98
00:04:18,295 --> 00:04:21,267
you’re collecting facts
and evidence that helps you

99
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:25,642
to replace these assumptions
with concrete stuff that you know.

100
00:04:26,122 --> 00:04:29,670
So, one key element that is part
of the value proposition is,

101
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,824
of course, who’s your target customer?

102
00:04:32,474 --> 00:04:34,875
What types of facts
have you collected on that front?

103
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,407
What are your assumptions?

104
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:37,592
Have you talked to customers?

105
00:04:37,592 --> 00:04:40,082
And that would be vital
in that role.

106
00:04:40,082 --> 00:04:41,967
What is the problem
that you’re solving,

107
00:04:41,967 --> 00:04:45,031
and what types of benefits
will you create for your customers?

108
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:46,907
Or another question,
who are your competitors,

109
00:04:46,907 --> 00:04:49,015
and what do they offer
in order to solve

110
00:04:49,015 --> 00:04:50,906
the above mentioned
customer problem?

111
00:04:51,226 --> 00:04:53,396
Why is your product offering superior,

112
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:55,437
or your service offering superior?

113
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:57,302
What is unique about it?

114
00:04:57,302 --> 00:04:59,657
That brings in the competitive
dimension again.

115
00:04:59,657 --> 00:05:02,598
Is this superiority
of key relevance to the customer?

116
00:05:02,908 --> 00:05:05,395
Will it influence the buying decision?

117
00:05:05,395 --> 00:05:07,098
These are all vital questions
that you need

118
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,292
to understand thoroughly

119
00:05:09,292 --> 00:05:12,701
before being able to draft
a compelling value proposition.

120
00:05:12,701 --> 00:05:15,868
So I really urge you,
and suggest to you,

121
00:05:15,868 --> 00:05:18,986
print out that slide here,
and try to fill it in.

122
00:05:19,326 --> 00:05:22,289
Take a pen, fill it in,
and learn about it.

123
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,337
Learn about your venture
and learn about the ways

124
00:05:25,337 --> 00:05:27,645
how you want to create value
with your venture

125
00:05:27,645 --> 00:05:30,809
by crafting the value proposition

126
00:05:30,809 --> 00:05:34,528
with facts as much as you can.

127
00:05:34,528 --> 00:05:36,058
Try to be precise.

128
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:37,986
And that’s what I also said

129
00:05:37,986 --> 00:05:40,389
when we talked
about the previous slide,

130
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:42,894
that this is a learning journey,
and you, over time,

131
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:44,812
you’re going to hone in,
you’re going to fine tune

132
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:45,774
your value proposition,

133
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:49,014
because, in fact, you learn
about your venture,

134
00:05:49,014 --> 00:05:52,075
you collect more evidence
and facts over time.

135
00:05:52,075 --> 00:05:54,572
So when you develop
your value proposition,

136
00:05:54,572 --> 00:05:56,673
of course you’ll have lots
of information needs,

137
00:05:56,673 --> 00:06:00,432
and these are listed here
in our Top 10 list, so to speak.

138
00:06:01,082 --> 00:06:04,122
Let me start by looking down
to the bottom here.

139
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:07,640
It says your value proposition
must express the <i>personality</i>,

140
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:10,871
the <i>strength</i>, <i>the soul</i>,
the <i>benefits</i> of your product,

141
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:13,810
as such, it must sound personal.

142
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:17,389
And there are words like <i>strength</i>
and <i>soul</i> in here,

143
00:06:17,389 --> 00:06:20,025
which means you have to
have a deep understanding,

144
00:06:20,025 --> 00:06:22,239
and <i>intuitive</i> understanding, as well,

145
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:25,902
of what your value proposition,
what your offerings are about.

146
00:06:26,662 --> 00:06:30,552
More concretely, we have drafted 
this Top 10 list, as I mentioned,

147
00:06:30,552 --> 00:06:35,722
and this Top 10 list helps you
to go through the questions

148
00:06:35,722 --> 00:06:37,024
that you need to answer

149
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:40,476
in order to understand
your value proposition.

150
00:06:41,146 --> 00:06:43,590
It’s about analyzing your offerings.

151
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:47,094
It’s about creating a profile
of your target customers.

152
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:50,022
It’s about identifying
the compelling reasons

153
00:06:50,022 --> 00:06:51,923
to act for your customers.

154
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:53,958
It’s about thinking about 
the customer experience,

155
00:06:53,958 --> 00:06:55,518
we talked about this before.

156
00:06:55,518 --> 00:06:57,767
It’s about expressing benefits
of your offering

157
00:06:57,767 --> 00:06:59,030
as a direct response

158
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:02,524
to the customers’
compelling reasons to act.

159
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:06,146
It’s about evaluating the cost
to customers in terms of money,

160
00:07:06,146 --> 00:07:10,308
resources, troubles, risk,
and lost opportunity,

161
00:07:11,138 --> 00:07:14,828
which mean you really have to stand
in the shoes of your customer.

162
00:07:14,828 --> 00:07:18,101
It’s about noting when 
your customer will experience

163
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:21,533
the benefit of your product,
so the timing component.

164
00:07:22,283 --> 00:07:26,569
It also means you have to
creatively define your competition.

165
00:07:26,969 --> 00:07:30,702
What are the real alternatives
that the customer faces?

166
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:33,708
It’s also about identifying
your key differentiators

167
00:07:33,708 --> 00:07:37,878
in terms of both what you <i>will</i> do
and what you <i>won’t</i> do.

168
00:07:37,878 --> 00:07:40,090
And finally, it’s also
about finding engagement.

169
00:07:40,090 --> 00:07:42,339
How do you involve the customer
in the offering

170
00:07:42,339 --> 00:07:45,489
to create a memorable experience?

171
00:07:45,489 --> 00:07:47,405
I know this is a long list.

172
00:07:47,405 --> 00:07:51,818
So, together with the previous slide,
I urge you to print this out,

173
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:54,755
and think about each
of these points,

174
00:07:54,755 --> 00:07:55,866
because they are so vital

175
00:07:55,866 --> 00:07:59,489
to developing a good
and compelling value proposition.

176
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,229
And then you also double-check
your value proposition

177
00:08:02,229 --> 00:08:05,056
in order to <i>really</i> understand
whether it’s compelling.

178
00:08:05,316 --> 00:08:08,713
And there are three key elements
that you need to keep in mind

179
00:08:08,713 --> 00:08:11,100
in order to check
your value proposition.

180
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:14,501
And these are the components
of strong value propositions.

181
00:08:14,501 --> 00:08:19,305
It’s <i>resonate</i>, meaning
"I want, I need this product."

182
00:08:19,305 --> 00:08:20,852
from the customers’ perspective.

183
00:08:20,852 --> 00:08:22,540
It’s <i>differentiate</i>,

184
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:25,828
meaning no alternatives are as good.

185
00:08:25,828 --> 00:08:27,820
And there’s <i>substantiate</i>,
which means,

186
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,961
from the customers’ perspective,
that the customer says,

187
00:08:29,961 --> 00:08:31,837
“I trust, I believe that you are able

188
00:08:31,837 --> 00:08:36,698
to deliver this type of product,
service, this type of promise.”

189
00:08:37,168 --> 00:08:39,681
Typically,  if you have
all three components,

190
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:42,793
this creates the foundation
for premium pricing,

191
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:46,193
it leads to generation success,
and also to customer loyalty

192
00:08:46,193 --> 00:08:49,541
because customer
will make positive experiences

193
00:08:49,541 --> 00:08:50,847
about your company.

194
00:08:50,847 --> 00:08:54,433
So now, let’s take one
of those elements away.

195
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:57,025
You have a product, for instance,
with <i>weak resonance</i>,

196
00:08:58,065 --> 00:09:00,464
so the "I want, I need" is not strong.

197
00:09:00,464 --> 00:09:02,610
But you still have one
that is difficult to substitute

198
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,743
and you’re able
to substantiate your claim.

199
00:09:04,743 --> 00:09:06,641
So what does this lead to?

200
00:09:06,641 --> 00:09:09,600
The buyer will say,
because there’s <i>weak resonance</i>,

201
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:12,707
“I don’t need it.
It’s not important enough.”

202
00:09:12,707 --> 00:09:15,728
And this is quite a problem
for a start-up,

203
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:18,371
because that means
he won’t buy your product.

204
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:22,328
Same story with taking away
the differentiate.

205
00:09:22,328 --> 00:09:26,108
You know, so you have a product
that is easy to substitute.

206
00:09:26,108 --> 00:09:28,109
You would have still strong resonance,

207
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,777
you’re able to substantiate,

208
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,555
but there are other options out there.

209
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:33,208
So what would the customer say?

210
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:34,249
Well, he would say,

211
00:09:34,249 --> 00:09:37,277
“What’s your best price?
I can do without you.”

212
00:09:37,277 --> 00:09:40,253
You know, and that means,
you don’t make the sale.

213
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:43,786
Or it’s hard to make the sale,
at least.

214
00:09:43,786 --> 00:09:46,677
And finally, if you have 
the substantiate out there,

215
00:09:46,677 --> 00:09:50,955
you know, you would say,
"Strong resonance is there.

216
00:09:50,955 --> 00:09:53,454
Yes, difficult to substitute is there."

217
00:09:53,454 --> 00:09:57,254
But the not able to substantiate
will lead the customer to say,

218
00:09:57,254 --> 00:10:00,062
“Well, I’m skeptical,
I can’t risk it.”

219
00:10:00,062 --> 00:10:01,326
What does that mean?

220
00:10:01,326 --> 00:10:04,518
It means, you don’t make the sale.

221
00:10:04,518 --> 00:10:07,642
So if you have one of these 
three elements taken away,

222
00:10:07,642 --> 00:10:09,101
you’re really in trouble.

223
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:10,973
So with a good value proposition,

224
00:10:10,973 --> 00:10:13,182
these three elements
should be present,

225
00:10:13,182 --> 00:10:15,517
so really go for them,

226
00:10:15,517 --> 00:10:17,650
and try to craft a value proposition

227
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:20,629
that you can tick
all these three elements.

228
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:22,413
So here’s an example.

229
00:10:22,413 --> 00:10:25,611
And, here we filled
in basically some information

230
00:10:25,611 --> 00:10:29,183
about a company that is producing
an eye movement tracker

231
00:10:29,183 --> 00:10:30,848
for the marketing domain.

232
00:10:30,848 --> 00:10:32,174
And it reads the following,

233
00:10:32,174 --> 00:10:35,326
as a result of our eye movement tracker,
customers,

234
00:10:35,326 --> 00:10:36,810
which are the market researchers

235
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:40,385
who are facing the need
to be aware of where buyers look at

236
00:10:40,385 --> 00:10:42,221
in their shopping environment,

237
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:46,568
will successfully track areas
of attention for only a price,--

238
00:10:46,568 --> 00:10:50,503
let’s say, of $50 per month
in a subscription-based model,--

239
00:10:50,503 --> 00:10:53,513
and enjoy non-biased simulation results

240
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:57,870
within 20 seconds
of recording the eye movement.

241
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,231
Compared to conventional forms
of gathering data,

242
00:11:01,231 --> 00:11:03,353
like questionnaires or surveys,

243
00:11:03,353 --> 00:11:05,069
the advantages
of using our offerings

244
00:11:05,069 --> 00:11:07,459
are non-biased research results,

245
00:11:07,459 --> 00:11:10,654
and therefore we can lead
to an improved product placement

246
00:11:10,654 --> 00:11:12,394
within your shopping environment.

247
00:11:13,274 --> 00:11:16,736
These are the ingredients
of a compelling value proposition.

248
00:11:16,976 --> 00:11:18,584
Please try it out for your venture,

249
00:11:18,584 --> 00:11:21,479
because it’s so important
that you understand

250
00:11:21,479 --> 00:11:23,824
in a very succinct way
what your venture’s about.

251
00:11:23,824 --> 00:11:25,587
This is important,
when you talk to customers,

252
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:28,742
other stakeholders,
any type of conversation,

253
00:11:28,742 --> 00:11:32,793
this will help you to succinctly say
why you are so good.

254
00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:36,068
And that’s something
that young companies need

255
00:11:36,068 --> 00:11:37,599
even more than established ones,

256
00:11:37,599 --> 00:11:40,723
because you have to get
that foothold in the market.

257
00:11:41,023 --> 00:11:43,840
So remember, that one sentence
that we discussed,

258
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,509
and also remember
to double check.

259
00:11:45,889 --> 00:11:48,231
A good value proposition
needs to <i>resonate</i>,

260
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:51,422
it needs to <i>differentiate</i>,
and it needs to <i>substantiate</i>.

261
00:11:51,422 --> 00:11:54,262
And if you take one of these away,
you will not make that sale.

262
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:55,446
But you need that sale!

263
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:57,829
So better you look at 
your value proposition

264
00:11:57,829 --> 00:12:01,340
twice, three times, try to improve it
and get it done.

265
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,639
Okay, I see you next week.

266
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:04,857
Thank you very much.
