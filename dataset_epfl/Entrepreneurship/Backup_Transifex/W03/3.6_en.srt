1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:07,780
So in this segment we are going to talk

2
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:09,565
about market entry, market penetration.

3
00:00:09,565 --> 00:00:12,655
Market entry is one of the <i>vital</i> steps

4
00:00:12,655 --> 00:00:14,679
in your firm's creation process, of course,

5
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:16,279
when you're trying to sell

6
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:17,831
your goods to the customers.

7
00:00:17,831 --> 00:00:19,131
You might have done so already

8
00:00:19,131 --> 00:00:20,851
with your crowdfunding campaign.

9
00:00:20,851 --> 00:00:22,301
So the crowdfunding campaign

10
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:24,127
that you launch is somehow

11
00:00:24,127 --> 00:00:25,727
a market entry as well.

12
00:00:25,807 --> 00:00:27,659
We are going to talk about some issues

13
00:00:27,659 --> 00:00:29,649
related to market entry and also to--

14
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:30,579
Market penetration.

15
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:32,559
So once you've actually launched

16
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:34,199
your product in the market,

17
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:36,799
you want to get it distributed and used

18
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,771
as widely as you possibly can

19
00:00:38,771 --> 00:00:40,321
for a lot of reasons that we're going to

20
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:42,481
talk about in the next few minutes.

21
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:44,908
The idea here is to get in the market

22
00:00:44,908 --> 00:00:46,808
and then expand your presence
in the market.

23
00:00:46,808 --> 00:00:48,658
Get growth! Exactly!

24
00:00:49,408 --> 00:00:50,694
Let me show you where we are

25
00:00:50,694 --> 00:00:53,514
in the overall sequence
of what we discussed this week.

26
00:00:53,514 --> 00:00:55,303
Specifically, there are a couple issues

27
00:00:55,303 --> 00:00:56,893
we want to discuss this week.

28
00:00:56,893 --> 00:00:59,453
When you remember back 
what we discussed already,

29
00:00:59,453 --> 00:01:01,813
one key element was actually the question:

30
00:01:01,813 --> 00:01:03,323
who's your target market?

31
00:01:03,323 --> 00:01:04,743
Among all of these people out there,

32
00:01:04,743 --> 00:01:06,123
who do you want to sell to?

33
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:09,223
What is the homogeneous group
of people or organizations

34
00:01:09,223 --> 00:01:11,333
that are comprising you’re targeting?

35
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:14,143
We build on that decision in the segment.

36
00:01:14,143 --> 00:01:15,753
We going to talk about a few issues

37
00:01:15,753 --> 00:01:18,213
that are of key relevance on top of that.

38
00:01:18,603 --> 00:01:21,783
One is of course the entry
challenges that you face.

39
00:01:22,083 --> 00:01:24,773
As a young new firm, you are facing

40
00:01:24,773 --> 00:01:28,243
lots of challenges when you enter a market
where a lot of incumbents

41
00:01:28,243 --> 00:01:30,343
and we going to discuss those briefly.

42
00:01:30,343 --> 00:01:32,313
The second one is to gain traction

43
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:34,113
actually in your target market.

44
00:01:34,113 --> 00:01:35,663
Meaning you’re making sales

45
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:36,923
and achieving more and more sales.

46
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:38,823
We're going to talk about some key ways

47
00:01:38,823 --> 00:01:40,503
of how you can achieve that.

48
00:01:40,503 --> 00:01:43,853
The third element we going
to talk about is actually

49
00:01:43,853 --> 00:01:45,543
understanding technology adoption.

50
00:01:45,543 --> 00:01:47,390
There are different sorts of buyers

51
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:48,840
in your target segment.

52
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,670
Some might be quite receptive

53
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:52,360
to what you are offering.

54
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:55,150
They're more visionary, you might say,

55
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,900
in what you are proposing

56
00:01:56,906 --> 00:01:58,946
and want to buy in immediately

57
00:01:58,946 --> 00:02:01,026
because they see what you are doing

58
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:03,576
and can immediately say,
"This is useful for me."

59
00:02:03,576 --> 00:02:05,546
While others might be
more cautious buyers.

60
00:02:05,546 --> 00:02:07,116
We going to walk you through

61
00:02:07,116 --> 00:02:10,006
this technology adoption
life-cycle as it’s called.

62
00:02:10,396 --> 00:02:12,926
And finally, we going to talk about--

63
00:02:13,596 --> 00:02:15,106
You might say the most important element.

64
00:02:15,106 --> 00:02:18,346
I would say an equally important
element here is achieving growth.

65
00:02:18,346 --> 00:02:20,466
There are a couple of dimensions

66
00:02:20,466 --> 00:02:22,116
that we are going to put forward.

67
00:02:22,116 --> 00:02:25,896
One is how do you design
your venture for growth.

68
00:02:26,036 --> 00:02:29,026
One matter, one key point is scalability.

69
00:02:29,026 --> 00:02:30,796
And the other key point is actually,

70
00:02:30,796 --> 00:02:33,246
what nowadays is called growth hacking

71
00:02:33,246 --> 00:02:35,146
to understand how you can maybe

72
00:02:35,146 --> 00:02:37,266
piggyback on other sites, websites,

73
00:02:37,266 --> 00:02:40,736
and to find other ways of accelerating,

74
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:41,866
speeding up your growth.

75
00:02:41,866 --> 00:02:43,896
So there are a couple of,
I think, very vital issues

76
00:02:43,896 --> 00:02:45,396
that we discuss this week.

77
00:02:45,396 --> 00:02:46,776
So let's get going!

78
00:02:47,236 --> 00:02:49,146
<i>(Chris) Alright, let's talk a little bit</i>

79
00:02:49,146 --> 00:02:52,556
<i>about frequently encountered
challenges in market entry.</i>

80
00:02:52,556 --> 00:02:54,397
<i>We don't have time to go through a lot</i>

81
00:02:54,397 --> 00:02:56,547
<i>of details on all of these right now.</i>

82
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:58,227
<i>Some of them we're going 
to talk about today.</i>

83
00:02:58,227 --> 00:03:00,767
<i>Some we're going to talk 
about in week five.</i>

84
00:03:02,407 --> 00:03:05,257
<i>We'll get a good feeling for the issues</i>

85
00:03:05,257 --> 00:03:06,517
<i>involved in market entry.</i>

86
00:03:06,517 --> 00:03:08,247
<i>(Marc) One of them, one of the key issues</i>

87
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:10,687
<i>is actually access to distribution checks.</i>

88
00:03:10,687 --> 00:03:13,760
<i>You know, if you have a good
that is sold via established</i>

89
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:17,140
<i>distribution channels,
it can be quite tough</i>

90
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:19,306
<i>to get into these outlets.</i>

91
00:03:19,376 --> 00:03:21,306
<i>If you go shopping typically,</i>

92
00:03:22,206 --> 00:03:25,066
<i>the store shelves are not</i>

93
00:03:25,066 --> 00:03:28,516
<i>waiting there empty for you.</i>

94
00:03:28,516 --> 00:03:32,006
<i>So, in a way, you might have to give</i>

95
00:03:32,006 --> 00:03:35,066
<i>the distributors some free products.</i>

96
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:38,096
<i>You might have to give the distributors
some help in advertising</i>

97
00:03:38,096 --> 00:03:40,836
<i>and that could get quickly 
into larger sums.</i>

98
00:03:40,836 --> 00:03:42,486
<i>So access to distributions</i>

99
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,796
<i>could be one key aspect</i>

100
00:03:44,796 --> 00:03:48,336
<i>in market entry that worries you 
and is a challenge.</i>

101
00:03:48,966 --> 00:03:52,656
<i>(Chris) Also, when you're small
it's just hard to get</i>

102
00:03:53,366 --> 00:03:56,296
<i> your customers' attention in general.</i>

103
00:03:56,956 --> 00:03:58,066
<i>One of the key issues here</i>

104
00:03:58,066 --> 00:04:00,736
<i>is just how do you grab the attention</i>

105
00:04:00,736 --> 00:04:02,966
<i>of potential customers 
when there are lots of things</i>

106
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:04,946
<i>competing for their attention.</i>

107
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:06,486
<i>(Marc) The crowdfunding platform
might be one, </i>

108
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:08,336
<i>your campaign that you launch there,</i>

109
00:04:08,336 --> 00:04:10,756
<i>might be one way of getting attention.</i>

110
00:04:11,216 --> 00:04:13,696
<i>There's also switching costs
of your potential customers.</i>

111
00:04:13,696 --> 00:04:16,816
<i>Meaning they are using 
solutions currently.</i>

112
00:04:16,816 --> 00:04:20,066
<i>They might have a cell phone plan
with a company</i>

113
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:21,626
<i>and you're trying to offer 
a new cell phone.</i>

114
00:04:21,626 --> 00:04:23,816
<i>In that sense, you have to convince them</i>

115
00:04:23,816 --> 00:04:27,266
<i>to get out of that existing contract
and switch over to you.</i>

116
00:04:27,526 --> 00:04:28,966
<i>(Chris) You have to exceed,</i>

117
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:31,416
<i>you have to give a better
value proposition then,</i>

118
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:33,866
<i>which is compensating
for the switching costs.</i>

119
00:04:33,866 --> 00:04:36,386
<i>Likewise, on your end once you have them</i>

120
00:04:36,386 --> 00:04:37,906
<i>if your switching cost are relatively low</i>

121
00:04:37,906 --> 00:04:39,616
<i>they can just leave you.</i>
(both laugh)

122
00:04:39,616 --> 00:04:41,836
<i>- (Marc) Exactly!
- (Chris) Go somewhere else.</i>

123
00:04:41,836 --> 00:04:43,776
<i>Which gets the threats from competition</i>

124
00:04:43,776 --> 00:04:47,226
<i>because there you have
different aspects of threats.</i>

125
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:50,456
<i>One thing that we think about a lot
is price competition</i>

126
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,506
<i>or some kind of competing product</i>

127
00:04:53,506 --> 00:04:55,766
<i>that’s coming out at a better deal,</i>

128
00:04:55,766 --> 00:04:56,976
<i>has a better value proposition,</i>

129
00:04:56,976 --> 00:04:59,486
<i>and that steals away your customers.</i>

130
00:04:59,486 --> 00:05:02,096
<i>(Marc) Finally, you need to also consider
your own cost structure,</i>

131
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:05,057
<i>because incumbent firms typically
produce many many more products.</i>

132
00:05:05,057 --> 00:05:08,507
<i>Which also means,
they have economies of scale.</i>

133
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,457
<i>That's what the technical term is.</i>

134
00:05:10,457 --> 00:05:12,747
<i>They are simply producing cheaper than you</i>

135
00:05:12,747 --> 00:05:14,077
<i>because they produce more.</i>

136
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:17,227
<i>They can have better supplier,</i>

137
00:05:19,496 --> 00:05:21,486
<i>get better offers from the suppliers,</i>

138
00:05:21,486 --> 00:05:23,156
<i>and they could have better offers</i>

139
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:26,406
<i>from the distributors when
seeking to offer the products.</i>

140
00:05:27,886 --> 00:05:31,416
<i>Finally, you also have costs arising
from educating your market,</i>

141
00:05:32,056 --> 00:05:34,305
<i>which means you are potentially</i>

142
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:36,115
<i>offering an innovation</i>

143
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:38,889
<i>and the customer just doesn’t know
what this innovation can do,</i>

144
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:41,479
<i>what the features of this innovation are.</i>

145
00:05:41,479 --> 00:05:43,959
<i>You want to have costs</i>

146
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:45,379
<i>in educating the market,</i>

147
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:47,532
<i>which the incumbent firms</i>

148
00:05:47,532 --> 00:05:50,662
<i>who are producing established product,
might not have.</i>

149
00:05:51,012 --> 00:05:54,032
<i>(Chris) So, I mean, that sounds 
like a lot of bad news.</i>

150
00:05:54,032 --> 00:05:57,462
(both laugh)

151
00:05:58,032 --> 00:05:59,434
<i>It’s not all bad.</i>

152
00:05:59,434 --> 00:06:03,644
<i>I think part of this is that 
if you’re out there first,</i>

153
00:06:04,454 --> 00:06:06,024
<i>you may be able to erect</i>

154
00:06:06,024 --> 00:06:09,974
<i>some barriers to entry for other firms
coming in after you.</i>

155
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:10,984
<i>(Marc) Exactly.</i>

156
00:06:14,474 --> 00:06:16,234
<i>(Chris) Yes, there are challenges
but on the other hand if</i>

157
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:17,684
<i>you're able to surmount those challenges</i>

158
00:06:17,684 --> 00:06:20,784
<i>then you may be able to build 
some even bigger challenges</i>

159
00:06:20,784 --> 00:06:22,654
<i>for the other people coming after you.</i>

160
00:06:22,654 --> 00:06:24,534
<i>(Marc) Exactly, that's a nice 
opportunity over time.</i>

161
00:06:24,534 --> 00:06:28,704
<i>One of the first key questions
you can ask yourself is well,</i>

162
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:30,365
<i>"When do I enter the market?"</i>

163
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:32,535
<i>You might be ready to enter the market now</i>

164
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:34,295
<i>but it might not be a wise idea</i>

165
00:06:34,295 --> 00:06:37,245
<i>to be the pioneer to enter the market</i>

166
00:06:37,245 --> 00:06:39,745
<i>because there are different cost, benefits</i>
<i>opportunities, and challenges</i>

167
00:06:39,745 --> 00:06:43,185
<i>associated with your entry timing.</i>

168
00:06:43,185 --> 00:06:45,255
<i>You know, early or later in a way.</i>

169
00:06:45,255 --> 00:06:46,946
<i>Typically, you differentiate between</i>

170
00:06:46,946 --> 00:06:50,416
<i>three types of entrance tiers.</i>

171
00:06:50,416 --> 00:06:52,236
<i>Pioneers are the disruptors,</i>

172
00:06:52,236 --> 00:06:55,196
<i>the first-movers as they are often called,
the fast followers, </i>

173
00:06:55,196 --> 00:06:57,046
<i>and then the late followers.</i>

174
00:06:57,046 --> 00:06:58,746
<i>Each of those faces distinct challenges</i>

175
00:06:58,746 --> 00:07:00,316
<i>and opportunities so if you think</i>

176
00:07:00,316 --> 00:07:02,486
<i>about the pioneers or disruptors here,</i>

177
00:07:02,486 --> 00:07:08,416
<i>it’s of course an opportunity for you
to shape brand recognition.</i>

178
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:10,806
<i>You are the one who is 
developing the product.</i>

179
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,306
<i>You’re the one who is considered</i>

180
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:14,986
<i>to be the leading organization</i>

181
00:07:14,986 --> 00:07:18,646
<i>on the technology front,
maybe, its the first-mover.</i>

182
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,836
<i>But, on the other hand,
there are disadvantages</i>

183
00:07:20,836 --> 00:07:22,106
<i>associated with that.</i>

184
00:07:22,106 --> 00:07:23,996
<i>We just mentioned educating the market.</i>

185
00:07:23,996 --> 00:07:26,616
<i>You have to have significant expenses</i>

186
00:07:26,616 --> 00:07:28,686
<i>perhaps to educate other people,</i>

187
00:07:28,686 --> 00:07:30,426
<i>to educate your customers</i>

188
00:07:30,432 --> 00:07:32,462
<i>about what your product can do.</i>

189
00:07:32,462 --> 00:07:35,222
<i>(Chris) The fast follower then
is able to take advantage of that</i>

190
00:07:35,222 --> 00:07:39,522
<i>because the fast follower could come in</i>

191
00:07:39,522 --> 00:07:43,372
<i>after the market is educated but still
relatively on the early side,</i>

192
00:07:43,372 --> 00:07:46,373
<i>thereby free riding off the initial</i>

193
00:07:46,385 --> 00:07:48,265
<i>expenditure of the pioneer.</i>

194
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,808
<i>(Marc) And he can also learn
from your mistakes as an entrant,</i>

195
00:07:51,808 --> 00:07:53,808
<i>the first entrant, because he can observe,</i>

196
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:56,428
<i>"Well, your company A, the entrant,</i>

197
00:07:56,428 --> 00:07:58,388
<i>the first entrant did this activity</i>

198
00:07:58,388 --> 00:07:59,818
<i>and this just didn’t work out."</i>

199
00:07:59,818 --> 00:08:03,168
<i>You can save that money
as the fast follower and say,</i>

200
00:08:03,168 --> 00:08:05,538
<i>"Okay I do it differently because I know</i>

201
00:08:05,538 --> 00:08:06,948
<i>that this doesn’t work out."</i>

202
00:08:06,948 --> 00:08:08,838
<i>Then we have the late followers.</i>

203
00:08:08,838 --> 00:08:10,558
<i>(Chris) The late followers basically</i>

204
00:08:10,558 --> 00:08:15,128
<i>come in toward the 
end of the life cycle there.</i>

205
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:20,018
<i>These are the ones who can enter
and for some of the same</i>

206
00:08:20,018 --> 00:08:21,808
<i>reasons we just discussed.</i>

207
00:08:21,808 --> 00:08:24,308
<i>The market is already educated;
the market is already</i>

208
00:08:24,308 --> 00:08:25,648
<i>demonstrated at that point.</i>

209
00:08:25,648 --> 00:08:27,938
<i>The fast follower of the market
isn’t necessarily demonstrated.</i>

210
00:08:27,938 --> 00:08:31,238
<i>But with the late follower,
they’ve demonstrated the market</i>

211
00:08:31,238 --> 00:08:35,198
<i>is viable so they can come in
and maybe they’ve got the scale</i>

212
00:08:35,198 --> 00:08:40,438
<i>to be able to come in
and do well in this market.</i>

213
00:08:40,438 --> 00:08:43,198
<i>(Marc) Exactly, they are also facing
what we just discussed also,</i>

214
00:08:43,198 --> 00:08:44,528
<i>the switching costs.</i>

215
00:08:44,528 --> 00:08:50,102
<i>They are facing the switching costs
of their existing market to work deal.</i>

216
00:08:50,102 --> 00:08:53,472
<i>In a way they have additional
expenditures there.</i>

217
00:08:53,472 --> 00:08:57,573
<i>You see, there’s always
some kind of trade-off here.</i>

218
00:08:57,573 --> 00:08:59,523
<i>You’re the pioneer, 
you have some benefit</i>

219
00:08:59,523 --> 00:09:02,923
<i>but also some challenges
as the fast follower and late follower.</i>

220
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:06,527
<i>What we know from research
in the past 20 years is that actually</i>

221
00:09:06,527 --> 00:09:09,857
<i>the first-mover advantage
that is so much talked about</i>

222
00:09:09,857 --> 00:09:11,637
<i>doesn’t really exist.</i>

223
00:09:11,637 --> 00:09:13,767
<i>In most markets it was not the first-mover</i>

224
00:09:13,767 --> 00:09:15,977
<i>who came out on top after a few years</i>

225
00:09:15,977 --> 00:09:17,427
<i>as the dominating company--</i>

226
00:09:17,427 --> 00:09:20,817
<i>(Chris) Some very specific circumstances
under which the pioneer is</i>

227
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:25,077
<i>really really benefiting
and in a lot of cases it seems</i>

228
00:09:25,077 --> 00:09:26,737
<i>more like the fast follower.</i>

229
00:09:26,737 --> 00:09:30,185
<i>(Marc) Exactly, and also the 
first follower surpasses the Pioneer.</i>

230
00:09:30,185 --> 00:09:32,385
<i>This really depends on your industry.</i>

231
00:09:33,705 --> 00:09:37,655
<i>Market timing is one key element
but there are other key elements.</i>

232
00:09:37,725 --> 00:09:39,635
<i>One other key element we want</i>

233
00:09:39,635 --> 00:09:41,905
<i>to turn to now is the 
technology adoption life cycle</i>

234
00:09:41,905 --> 00:09:43,734
<i>because within your market</i>

235
00:09:43,734 --> 00:09:48,154
<i>there are also different inclinations
to buy your product.</i>

236
00:09:48,384 --> 00:09:50,964
<i>Different customers might want
your product earlier than</i>

237
00:09:50,964 --> 00:09:52,614
<i>other types of customers.</i>

238
00:09:52,614 --> 00:09:56,164
<i>(Chris) So let’s think about
the technology adoption life cycle.</i>

239
00:09:57,584 --> 00:10:01,654
<i>You think about the total number
of customers that you’re going to have.</i>

240
00:10:02,694 --> 00:10:05,824
<i>There’s one way of 
representing this graphically.</i>

241
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:11,442
<i>Then you divide those customers
into the time periods,</i>

242
00:10:11,512 --> 00:10:15,502
<i>its equal time periods and that would 
trace out in many cases</i>

243
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:19,312
<i>a kind of a bell curve shape distribution.</i>

244
00:10:20,762 --> 00:10:24,192
<i>What you can see is you have different</i>

245
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:27,112
<i>groups of people based on the timing</i>

246
00:10:28,732 --> 00:10:33,242
<i>of their adoption of whatever
it is that you’re proposing.</i>

247
00:10:33,562 --> 00:10:36,590
<i>Then we would start with these innovators</i>

248
00:10:37,244 --> 00:10:39,009
<i>at the earliest stages and then we would</i>

249
00:10:39,009 --> 00:10:41,904
<i>have early adopters to come in afterwards</i>

250
00:10:41,904 --> 00:10:43,894
<i>and then you’ve got an early majority,</i>

251
00:10:43,894 --> 00:10:46,914
<i>a late majority, and you’ve got laggards.</i>

252
00:10:47,447 --> 00:10:49,477
<i>(Marc) What’s important to realize is that</i>

253
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:50,537
<i>in order to create a venture</i>

254
00:10:50,537 --> 00:10:52,407
<i>that is viable you have to have</i>

255
00:10:54,167 --> 00:10:55,547
<i>the majority on your side.</i>

256
00:10:55,547 --> 00:10:58,120
<i>Meaning you have to have a significant 
number of sales to make</i>

257
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,055
<i>your company viable and growing.</i>

258
00:11:00,055 --> 00:11:03,085
<i>In a way, it’s not enough to just cater</i>

259
00:11:03,085 --> 00:11:05,015
<i>to the innovators and the early adopters</i>

260
00:11:05,155 --> 00:11:07,745
<i>but you have to enter that majority market</i>

261
00:11:07,745 --> 00:11:09,005
<i>and we come back to that in a minute</i>

262
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:10,745
<i>because that’s highly important point.</i>

263
00:11:10,745 --> 00:11:15,215
<i>But let’s look at these individual
folks here in more detail.</i>

264
00:11:15,215 --> 00:11:17,665
<i>You have the innovators,
the techies they would say;</i>

265
00:11:17,665 --> 00:11:20,649
"I buy this product because
I want to try it.*

266
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:23,109
<i>It's new. I don’t know it. I try it.</i>

267
00:11:23,109 --> 00:11:24,289
<i>I love technology."</i>

268
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:26,609
<i>Which is a very different type</i>

269
00:11:26,609 --> 00:11:29,099
<i>of motivation than what we
will be seeing in the next segment.</i>

270
00:11:29,099 --> 00:11:30,289
<i>(Chris) That’s a very small--</i>

271
00:11:30,289 --> 00:11:33,529
<i>The emphasis here is that
that’s a really small niche.</i>

272
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:38,259
<i>It’s not to say you can't have a viable
business in that particular space</i>

273
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:40,019
<i>but it’s going to be a small business.</i>

274
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,299
<i>(Marc) Exactly, super small maybe.</i>
(men laughing)

275
00:11:42,299 --> 00:11:47,103
<i>(Chris) That's right, visionaries then,
the next group of early adopters.</i>

276
00:11:47,103 --> 00:11:51,383
<i>These people are the ones
who see something coming </i>

277
00:11:51,383 --> 00:11:55,965
<i>and want to get in before the masses do,</i>

278
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,065
<i>before the herd comes in --</i>

279
00:11:58,065 --> 00:12:03,835
<i>(Marc) Yes! The point is I think,
they might say, "This product helps me</i>

280
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:06,225
<i>to streamline my business
processes, for instance.</i>

281
00:12:06,225 --> 00:12:08,495
<i>I can be a much more efficient producer."</i>

282
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:09,815
<i>and they have this visionary component</i>

283
00:12:09,815 --> 00:12:11,675
<i>to say how does this technology,</i>

284
00:12:11,675 --> 00:12:14,099
<i>or this product help me in this way.</i>

285
00:12:14,099 --> 00:12:16,149
<i>The third type would be the pragmatist;</i>

286
00:12:16,149 --> 00:12:18,379
<i>they say, "We would stick with the herd."</i>

287
00:12:18,379 --> 00:12:21,339
<i>Meaning we are buying
the product once all the others</i>

288
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:23,294
<i>around me are buying it.</i>

289
00:12:23,294 --> 00:12:26,204
<i>Then you would have the conservatives--</i>

290
00:12:26,204 --> 00:12:28,774
<i>(Chris) Who basically are thinking that</i>

291
00:12:28,774 --> 00:12:31,284
<i>they want to make sure that it’s proven.</i>

292
00:12:31,284 --> 00:12:34,038
<i>They really hold on. Let’s make sure--</i>

293
00:12:34,038 --> 00:12:35,528
<i>(Marc) don't buy a better version --</i>

294
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,928
<i>(Chris) I want to make sure 
this is the working,</i>

295
00:12:37,928 --> 00:12:39,148
<i>the one that’s very smooth</i>

296
00:12:39,148 --> 00:12:41,368
<i>it’s got all the problems ironed out 
before I'm willing to--</i>

297
00:12:41,368 --> 00:12:42,848
<i>(Marc) I want to have standard.</i>

298
00:12:42,848 --> 00:12:44,398
<i>I don’t want to have just any type product</i>

299
00:12:44,398 --> 00:12:45,948
<i>that’s going to disappear in a few years.</i>

300
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:47,758
<i>I want to have the standard
that will be around.</i>

301
00:12:47,758 --> 00:12:50,108
<i>Then finally, you have the skeptics.</i>

302
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:53,928
<i>The skeptics would be saying,
"No way I’m going to buy this product.</i>

303
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:55,748
<i>Only if there's no other 
option out there--</i>

304
00:12:55,748 --> 00:12:58,798
<i>- (Chris) There's nothing left for me.
- (Marc) I have to buy it now!</i>

305
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:00,959
<i>And if you think about it maybe
from your own experience,</i>

306
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:04,689
<i>you have some ideas of some products,
think about the first cell phone.</i>

307
00:13:04,689 --> 00:13:08,589
<i>Think about some other products
that are technology driven.</i>

308
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:12,539
<i>Think about the first versions of
iPad or iPhone!</i>

309
00:13:13,503 --> 00:13:17,283
<i>The cell phones that have these
capabilities of touch screens, etc.</i>

310
00:13:17,283 --> 00:13:21,403
<i>So, you can see what we mean
with this real-life examples</i>

311
00:13:21,403 --> 00:13:23,243
<i>in a much more intuitive way.</i>

312
00:13:24,253 --> 00:13:29,603
<i>One important element
to understand with this bell curve,</i>

313
00:13:29,603 --> 00:13:31,633
<i>with this technology adoption life cycle</i>

314
00:13:31,633 --> 00:13:35,423
<i>is that there’s a chasm
of what it’s called between</i>

315
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:39,443
<i>these early buyers, the early adopters,
and the early majority.</i>

316
00:13:39,583 --> 00:13:42,042
<i>This is a chasm that is important
to understand too.</i>

317
00:13:42,042 --> 00:13:44,382
<i>We want to focus on that one next.</i>

318
00:13:44,932 --> 00:13:47,402
<i>In order to understand how
to enter that mainstream market</i>

319
00:13:47,402 --> 00:13:49,485
<i>you have to understand
the difference between</i>

320
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:51,502
<i>a visionary and a pragmatist
and for that purpose,</i>

321
00:13:51,502 --> 00:13:54,182
<i>I am the pragmatist now
and Chris is the visionary.</i>

322
00:13:54,422 --> 00:13:56,522
<i>(Marc) What is the visionary thinking?</i>

323
00:13:56,522 --> 00:13:58,773
<i>(Chris) Me as a visionary,
I’m more adventurous.</i>

324
00:13:58,773 --> 00:14:00,645
<i>(Marc) I'm more cautious as a pragmatist.</i>

325
00:14:00,645 --> 00:14:02,725
<i>(Chris) I don’t mind getting in early
into the market.</i>

326
00:14:02,725 --> 00:14:04,885
<i>(Marc) I’m a later buyer.</i>

327
00:14:04,885 --> 00:14:06,625
<i>(Chris) I want state-of-the-art.</i>

328
00:14:06,625 --> 00:14:08,565
<i>(Marc) I have more of this
wait-and-see attitude.</i>

329
00:14:08,565 --> 00:14:10,505
<i>(Chris) I want to do a first strike.</i>

330
00:14:10,505 --> 00:14:12,255
<i>(Marc) I want the industry standard.</i>

331
00:14:12,255 --> 00:14:13,585
<i>(Chris) I like to think big.</i>

332
00:14:13,585 --> 00:14:15,235
<i>(Marc) I’m more a realist.</i>

333
00:14:15,235 --> 00:14:17,065
<i>(Chris) And I like to spend big.</i>

334
00:14:17,065 --> 00:14:18,227
<i>(Marc) Yeah I know that!</i>

335
00:14:18,227 --> 00:14:18,997
(men laughing)

336
00:14:18,997 --> 00:14:20,737
<i>I want to spend according to budget.</i>

337
00:14:21,747 --> 00:14:24,267
<i>(Chris) I’m seeing with my eyes closed.</i>

338
00:14:24,837 --> 00:14:26,547
<i>(Marc) While I see with my eyes open.</i>

339
00:14:27,012 --> 00:14:28,402
<i>We did this in a more funny way,</i>

340
00:14:28,402 --> 00:14:30,522
<i>but I think there’s some fundamental truth</i>

341
00:14:30,522 --> 00:14:32,562
<i>to these different situations
because you will face</i>

342
00:14:32,562 --> 00:14:33,822
<i>these buyers out there.</i>

343
00:14:33,822 --> 00:14:35,912
<i>Those of you who’ve already
embarked on a venture journey</i>

344
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:38,642
<i>might have seen when you talk 
to some people that say, </i>

345
00:14:38,642 --> 00:14:40,842
<i>"Oh I’m reluctant to test your product."</i>

346
00:14:40,842 --> 00:14:43,702
<i>While others might be 
more engaging and say,</i>

347
00:14:43,702 --> 00:14:45,705
<i>"Give me the new product 
I want to try it."</i>

348
00:14:45,705 --> 00:14:48,785
<i>So, your marketing must consider
these buyer group preferences</i>

349
00:14:48,785 --> 00:14:52,355
<i>because otherwise, 
you will be stuck in a chasm, </i>

350
00:14:52,355 --> 00:14:54,765
<i>falling into this chasm which is here. </i>

351
00:14:55,564 --> 00:14:57,774
<i>And will not be able...</i>

352
00:14:58,475 --> 00:15:01,245
<i>(Chris) To actually gain access
to this whole market here.</i>

353
00:15:01,495 --> 00:15:05,405
<i>That group of visionaries
is that one small one on this side.</i>

354
00:15:06,145 --> 00:15:12,902
<i>Then we have this group of pragmatists
that are the really, the first big chance</i>

355
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:15,002
<i>to gain some scale here.</i>

356
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:18,902
<i>(Marc) Exactly, that provides you,
this market provides you with the growth</i>

357
00:15:19,962 --> 00:15:22,392
<i>that you so much need
in your venture creation.</i>

358
00:15:22,392 --> 00:15:24,112
<i>(Chris) That’s the crossing the chasm.</i>

359
00:15:24,112 --> 00:15:25,992
<i>People talk about crossing the chasm
that’s what they’re referring to.</i>

360
00:15:25,992 --> 00:15:30,002
<i>They’re referring to getting past
these visionary buyers</i>

361
00:15:30,002 --> 00:15:33,582
<i>and getting onto that group of 
more pragmatic buyers.</i>

362
00:15:33,582 --> 00:15:35,223
<i>(Marc) Exactly and in order to do this</i>

363
00:15:35,223 --> 00:15:39,283
<i>you could say "I want to jump this chasm,
what can you do?"</i>

364
00:15:39,683 --> 00:15:42,013
<i>I think one important thing
that you need to do is</i>

365
00:15:42,013 --> 00:15:44,003
<i>to look closely at your product</i>

366
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:47,323
<i>and look closely at your marketing message
that you’re sending to these people.</i>

367
00:15:47,323 --> 00:15:51,693
<i>Because they will be receiving
those marketing messages very differently.</i>

368
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:53,633
<i>Let’s look at that in more detail.</i>

369
00:15:53,633 --> 00:15:57,343
<i>(Chris) To cross this chasm,
we have to rethink the way we are</i>

370
00:15:57,343 --> 00:15:59,743
<i>marketing to our customer base.</i>

371
00:15:59,743 --> 00:16:02,253
<i>In the early stages now,
you’ve got the visionary people.</i>

372
00:16:02,253 --> 00:16:04,433
<i>So you’re very product centric.</i>

373
00:16:04,433 --> 00:16:07,313
<i>You’re going for the best solution
because you know they like it,</i>

374
00:16:07,313 --> 00:16:10,043
<i>the fastest, the smallest, lightest, etc.</i>

375
00:16:11,063 --> 00:16:14,223
<i>You want to provide them with
the most elegant architecture</i>

376
00:16:14,693 --> 00:16:16,383
<i>because they appreciate that.</i>

377
00:16:16,383 --> 00:16:19,058
<i>You want to give them
unique functionality</i>

378
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:24,718
<i>and you want to give them
something at a reasonable cost.</i>

379
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:28,488
<i>(Marc) Exactly and pull the 
more pragmatist market.</i>

380
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:31,978
<i>It's biggest installed base that counts</i>

381
00:16:31,978 --> 00:16:36,698
<i>so you can market to them once 
you have a significant installed base.</i>

382
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:39,868
<i>You have to give them
quite a lot of third-party support.</i>

383
00:16:39,868 --> 00:16:42,703
<i>You have to show them that
you are the de facto standard.</i>

384
00:16:42,913 --> 00:16:44,753
<i>Remember that they are
very cautious buyers.</i>

385
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:48,543
<i>You want to give them quite a good quality</i>

386
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:50,523
<i>of support because they need the support.</i>

387
00:16:50,523 --> 00:16:53,703
<i>They don’t want the bad product
where it has lots of flaws.</i>

388
00:16:53,723 --> 00:16:55,983
<i>They are looking at the cost of ownership.</i>

389
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:57,593
<i>Because they are looking
at the cost of ownership,</i>

390
00:16:57,593 --> 00:16:59,113
<i>it’s not only the purchase price</i>

391
00:16:59,113 --> 00:17:01,153
<i>that matters but also maybe 
maintenance, etc.</i>

392
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:04,953
<i>So, if you want to achieve early sales,
these metrics on</i>

393
00:17:04,953 --> 00:17:06,893
<i>the product centric side matter.</i>

394
00:17:06,893 --> 00:17:10,593
<i>If you want to cross the chasm,
which is so important for growth,</i>

395
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,353
<i>these other metrics are key.</i>

396
00:17:14,407 --> 00:17:18,177
<i>Big picture it means,
if you are achieving sales early on</i>

397
00:17:18,177 --> 00:17:20,350
<i>you might be falling into a trap</i>

398
00:17:20,350 --> 00:17:22,330
<i>and saying, "Well everything works great,</i>

399
00:17:22,330 --> 00:17:23,740
<i>I just have to spend more money</i>

400
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:27,550
<i>on the same message."
which in fact is a trap.</i>

401
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,036
<i>(Chris) You end up saturating
the small market when</i>

402
00:17:30,036 --> 00:17:32,876
<i>you could’ve crossed into the bigger one
and I think that’s the key.</i>

403
00:17:32,876 --> 00:17:34,456
<i>Then you have to change your marketing</i>

404
00:17:34,456 --> 00:17:38,276
<i>and change the way that,
the customers are perceiving</i>

405
00:17:38,276 --> 00:17:41,193
<i>what you’re doing and that’s
going to be focused on the sort of</i>

406
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:44,303
<i>reliability, service, support.</i>

407
00:17:44,303 --> 00:17:48,025
<i>(Marc) It's just in human nature,
if something works out successfully,</i>

408
00:17:48,725 --> 00:17:51,875
<i>here you have to stop something
that is successful to become</i>

409
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:53,485
<i>even more successful.</i>

410
00:17:53,485 --> 00:17:56,085
<i>You have to make that move
and cross the chasm.</i>

411
00:17:56,085 --> 00:17:59,545
<i>I think that’s the trick with it
and that’s the challenge with it.</i>

412
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:02,579
<i>Moving from left side, to the right side,</i>

413
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:06,004
<i>to the next segment is so vital
and it will require a deep change</i>

414
00:18:06,004 --> 00:18:08,794
<i>of thinking on your behalf
as the entrepreneur.</i>

415
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,104
So the technology adoption life cycle

416
00:18:11,104 --> 00:18:13,534
gives you some information about

417
00:18:13,534 --> 00:18:15,554
achieving growth in your venture.

418
00:18:15,554 --> 00:18:17,274
Meaning you have to change

419
00:18:17,274 --> 00:18:18,914
your marketing message at some point

420
00:18:18,914 --> 00:18:20,694
to address the larger market,

421
00:18:20,694 --> 00:18:22,324
the majority of the market.

422
00:18:22,324 --> 00:18:23,704
There are other insight that we want

423
00:18:23,704 --> 00:18:25,664
to share with you relating to growth

424
00:18:25,664 --> 00:18:27,054
and these are vital insights

425
00:18:27,054 --> 00:18:30,454
because they address two key points, 
which are...

426
00:18:30,454 --> 00:18:32,824
(Chris) Scalability is the first one

427
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,200
and the second one is how do you

428
00:18:36,209 --> 00:18:39,679
have specific tactics to achieve growth.

429
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,119
Some people call growth hacking.

430
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:42,399
Let’s talk about each of those.

431
00:18:42,399 --> 00:18:45,759
(Marc) Exactly, so let me start with
the scalability questions.

432
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:48,429
The first question is one of designing

433
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:50,209
your business for scalability.

434
00:18:50,209 --> 00:18:51,389
There are some businesses

435
00:18:51,389 --> 00:18:53,479
who are more scalable than others.

436
00:18:53,479 --> 00:18:55,999
Think about more consulting driven business

437
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:58,299
where you have to add 
new people in order to grow.

438
00:18:58,299 --> 00:19:00,249
Where there’s a software driven business

439
00:19:00,249 --> 00:19:02,819
where you might want to add another server

440
00:19:02,819 --> 00:19:04,479
and then you can serve another hundred

441
00:19:04,479 --> 00:19:06,129
or two-hundred million clients.

442
00:19:06,129 --> 00:19:08,229
There are different challenges in

443
00:19:08,229 --> 00:19:11,009
achieving scalability so this does,

444
00:19:11,009 --> 00:19:14,339
by no means, mean that these ventures

445
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:16,759
that have a more human capital driven

446
00:19:16,759 --> 00:19:19,329
are non-profitable businesses

447
00:19:19,329 --> 00:19:21,329
or in fewer business they can be

448
00:19:21,329 --> 00:19:22,949
wonderful businesses as well.

449
00:19:22,949 --> 00:19:24,589
It just means that they 
don’t scale as well.

450
00:19:24,589 --> 00:19:26,379
If you want to achieve hyper growth

451
00:19:26,379 --> 00:19:31,129
and large growth rates, 
scalability is an issue

452
00:19:31,129 --> 00:19:32,739
that you need to consider.

453
00:19:32,739 --> 00:19:34,999
When you think about 
scalability of your ventures,

454
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:37,673
try to understand these intrinsic features.

455
00:19:37,673 --> 00:19:39,923
Is my business actually scalable

456
00:19:39,923 --> 00:19:42,153
and what does it take to actually grow

457
00:19:42,153 --> 00:19:44,263
the customer base two-fold,

458
00:19:44,263 --> 00:19:45,613
three-fold, four-fold?

459
00:19:45,613 --> 00:19:47,333
What does that mean for my business?

460
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:48,283
Does it mean that I have to hire

461
00:19:48,283 --> 00:19:50,163
lots of people or are there other ways,

462
00:19:50,163 --> 00:19:52,533
more efficient ways to grow your ventures?

463
00:19:52,533 --> 00:19:54,013
So in a way when you design your venture,

464
00:19:54,013 --> 00:19:56,073
you already need to think well,

465
00:19:56,073 --> 00:19:58,253
"If I think big what would that mean

466
00:19:58,253 --> 00:19:59,963
for my venture creation process?"

467
00:19:59,963 --> 00:20:01,393
It also means that you have to raise

468
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:02,943
adequate amounts of financing.

469
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:04,783
It also means that you have to attract

470
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:07,463
talent that shares with you that vision

471
00:20:07,464 --> 00:20:09,674
as it allows you to grow your venture;

472
00:20:09,674 --> 00:20:11,064
that issue of growth that

473
00:20:11,064 --> 00:20:13,214
Chris will talk about in a minute.

474
00:20:13,404 --> 00:20:14,454
It also means that you need

475
00:20:14,454 --> 00:20:16,944
to design your customer relationships,

476
00:20:16,944 --> 00:20:19,184
your distributor relationships
in a way that allows you

477
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:21,574
to achieve a higher throughput.

478
00:20:21,574 --> 00:20:24,124
There are lots of questions
that you want to address

479
00:20:24,124 --> 00:20:26,924
in the business design of scalability.

480
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:29,584
The other point would be to actually

481
00:20:29,584 --> 00:20:32,994
find interesting ways to piggyback

482
00:20:32,994 --> 00:20:34,814
on other companies 
to accelerate your growth

483
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:37,474
and Chris will come with that point.

484
00:20:37,474 --> 00:20:40,657
So, we just talked about achieving 
significant growth

485
00:20:40,657 --> 00:20:44,237
and for sure one of the 
goals of this whole course

486
00:20:44,237 --> 00:20:47,821
is to take growth-oriented

487
00:20:47,821 --> 00:20:49,151
business opportunities

488
00:20:49,151 --> 00:20:51,151
and try and make them a reality.

489
00:20:51,151 --> 00:20:54,221
You make them a reality 
by focusing on growth.

490
00:20:54,221 --> 00:20:56,201
That’s why we call it growth hacking

491
00:20:56,201 --> 00:20:58,441
which is, basically means you’re paying

492
00:20:58,441 --> 00:21:02,071
a lot of attention to the growth tactics

493
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:04,351
and strategies of your company.

494
00:21:04,351 --> 00:21:05,761
You want to basically do

495
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:09,021
everything you can possibly
do to grow the company

496
00:21:09,021 --> 00:21:10,931
and that means you also need

497
00:21:10,931 --> 00:21:13,731
to track the growth and run experiments

498
00:21:13,731 --> 00:21:14,991
and see what works.

499
00:21:14,991 --> 00:21:18,081
Traditional marketing departments,

500
00:21:18,081 --> 00:21:21,091
in big companies also think
a lot about growth.

501
00:21:21,761 --> 00:21:25,551
Here, we’re talking about a
more narrow focus on that

502
00:21:25,551 --> 00:21:26,851
as being one of our goals

503
00:21:26,851 --> 00:21:29,181
because we really want
to get across that chasm.

504
00:21:29,181 --> 00:21:31,211
We need to be able to exploit

505
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:33,401
a much bigger market.

506
00:21:34,281 --> 00:21:35,981
If we have a bottleneck situation

507
00:21:35,981 --> 00:21:37,581
where we have a few people,

508
00:21:37,581 --> 00:21:39,971
we need to hire a new person
every time we get a new customer

509
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:42,591
then we don’t really have
a big growth opportunity.

510
00:21:42,591 --> 00:21:43,881
So there might be some tactics

511
00:21:43,881 --> 00:21:45,721
that firms can use to try

512
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,541
and jumpstart the growth

513
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,411
which people call growth hacking.

514
00:21:49,411 --> 00:21:51,661
When we talk about a couple
examples of those right now.

515
00:21:51,661 --> 00:21:53,951
<i>(Marc) An interesting example
of growth hacking is Dropbox.</i>

516
00:21:53,951 --> 00:21:56,101
<i>Some of you might be familiar
with that type of service.</i>

517
00:21:56,101 --> 00:22:01,181
<i>Dropbox offers you the possibility
to store your files in the cloud.</i>

518
00:22:02,121 --> 00:22:04,021
<i>Meaning you can have access</i>

519
00:22:04,021 --> 00:22:05,591
<i>to them from anywhere.</i>

520
00:22:05,591 --> 00:22:07,321
<i>You can also share them with other people</i>

521
00:22:07,321 --> 00:22:09,001
<i>so you can work on the same document</i>

522
00:22:09,001 --> 00:22:10,661
<i>like professors sometimes do</i>

523
00:22:10,661 --> 00:22:13,511
<i>on research papers, on books,
write books together,</i>

524
00:22:13,511 --> 00:22:15,621
<i>and work on the same document</i>

525
00:22:15,621 --> 00:22:18,321
<i>that are not locally stored 
on your computer.</i>

526
00:22:18,321 --> 00:22:20,881
<i>This shouldn’t be advertising
for Dropbox here!</i>

527
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:23,111
<i>What we want to point out
is that they actually had quite</i>

528
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:25,841
<i>an interesting growth strategy
because they said,</i>

529
00:22:25,841 --> 00:22:30,101
<i>"Okay, you get 16 gigabytes of free space
by inviting your friends."</i>

530
00:22:30,101 --> 00:22:32,351
<i>What do they do that way --</i>

531
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:35,441
<i>(Chris) Its a kind of viral marketing
type thing where you convert</i>

532
00:22:35,441 --> 00:22:38,601
<i>your current customers into people</i>

533
00:22:38,601 --> 00:22:41,671
<i>who are marketing for you
by offering them some kind of incentive.</i>

534
00:22:41,671 --> 00:22:43,211
<i>In this particular case you know,</i>

535
00:22:43,211 --> 00:22:45,331
<i>the incentive was I’m going 
to increase your space.</i>

536
00:22:45,991 --> 00:22:49,971
<i>I know that I was out there
hitting up all my friends here to add.</i>

537
00:22:49,971 --> 00:22:51,971
<i>It’s enabling them to grow more rapidly.</i>

538
00:22:51,971 --> 00:22:53,791
<i>It also creates a switching costs
in some sense</i>

539
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:57,071
<i>because if I'm sharing files with you</i>

540
00:22:57,071 --> 00:22:59,251
<i>because we're writing a paper together</i>

541
00:22:59,251 --> 00:23:03,551
<i>if I want to switch then I have
to also get you to switch too.</i>

542
00:23:03,551 --> 00:23:08,158
<i>It’s adding a little bit of friction
to the customer base</i>

543
00:23:08,158 --> 00:23:09,958
<i>making them more likely to stick around.</i>

544
00:23:09,958 --> 00:23:12,308
<i>(Marc) Exactly, so you gain customers
and you retain them.</i>

545
00:23:12,308 --> 00:23:14,548
<i>This is a wonderful situation
for any type of venture</i>

546
00:23:14,548 --> 00:23:17,328
<i>because once you lose a customer
you would have to regain it</i>

547
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:20,338
<i>but once you retain
and make the customer stick,</i>

548
00:23:20,338 --> 00:23:22,023
<i>that’s actually a wonderful situation.</i>

549
00:23:22,023 --> 00:23:25,143
<i>Think about also this example
in a more generic way</i>

550
00:23:25,143 --> 00:23:27,783
<i>when you’re trying to apply it
maybe to your venture.</i>

551
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,773
<i>Maybe this type of approach fits.</i>

552
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:31,266
<i>There’s another example.</i>

553
00:23:31,266 --> 00:23:35,166
<i>(Chris) This is the airbnb,
a place where people can rent out</i>

554
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:38,636
<i>their extra couch space,
or bedrooms, or properties</i>

555
00:23:38,636 --> 00:23:40,096
<i>for temporary stays.</i>

556
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:47,546
<i>The idea there was to cross-list
airbnb listings on Craigslist,</i>

557
00:23:47,546 --> 00:23:51,061
<i>which is a local want-ads service
with a huge huge base.</i>

558
00:23:51,061 --> 00:23:53,631
<i>Therefore building the base
and simultaneously making</i>

559
00:23:53,631 --> 00:23:55,151
<i>the service more attractive.</i>

560
00:23:55,151 --> 00:23:57,581
<i>(Marc) Exactly, that actually,
if you think about it,</i>

561
00:23:57,581 --> 00:23:59,361
<i>that’s about growth hacking.</i>

562
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:00,861
<i>That’s a wonderful way of growth hacking.</i>

563
00:24:00,861 --> 00:24:02,551
<i>But you need to seize the opportunity</i>

564
00:24:02,551 --> 00:24:05,531
<i>to cross-list your offering
and then you say,</i>

565
00:24:05,531 --> 00:24:07,831
<i>"Okay, I have to find a way to actually</i>

566
00:24:07,831 --> 00:24:09,121
<i>link it up with Craigslist."</i>

567
00:24:09,121 --> 00:24:13,651
<i>Their airbnb guy actually spent quite some
effort in tailoring their technology,</i>

568
00:24:13,651 --> 00:24:16,041
<i>their software so it fits with Craigslist.</i>

569
00:24:17,041 --> 00:24:21,581
<i>So of all these two examples
should tell you that you should</i>

570
00:24:21,581 --> 00:24:23,641
<i>try to focus very much on growth.</i>

571
00:24:23,641 --> 00:24:27,771
<i>You might have ideas about
piggybacking on other sites</i>

572
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:31,621
<i>or developing services, word-of-mouth,</i>

573
00:24:31,621 --> 00:24:33,381
<i>viral marketing that helps actually</i>

574
00:24:33,381 --> 00:24:35,531
<i>to accelerate real growth</i>

575
00:24:35,531 --> 00:24:38,501
<i>and this focus on growth is essential</i>

576
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:40,801
<i>in these early days because as you said,</i>

577
00:24:40,801 --> 00:24:42,791
<i>Chris before, you’re not a large company</i>

578
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:44,912
<i>affording the luxury, not having to grow</i>

579
00:24:44,912 --> 00:24:47,272
<i>like 200 percent, 500 percent per year.</i>

580
00:24:47,272 --> 00:24:50,812
<i>Okay, so this already brings us
to the end of the segment</i>

581
00:24:50,812 --> 00:24:53,432
and if you think what we discussed today,

582
00:24:53,432 --> 00:24:55,102
it’s covered a lot of ground.

583
00:24:55,102 --> 00:24:57,432
We talked in the previous segment

584
00:24:57,432 --> 00:24:59,252
about the choice of target market.

585
00:24:59,252 --> 00:25:01,232
Today we covered lots of additional ground

586
00:25:01,232 --> 00:25:03,822
by saying what are the entry challenges.

587
00:25:03,822 --> 00:25:06,182
Chris mentioned that he
going to talk about some of them

588
00:25:06,182 --> 00:25:08,012
in a later segment as well.

589
00:25:08,012 --> 00:25:09,622
We talked about gaining traction

590
00:25:09,622 --> 00:25:10,702
in your target market,

591
00:25:10,702 --> 00:25:13,112
understanding the technology
adoption life cycle.

592
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:15,162
And finally, we talked about growth.

593
00:25:15,162 --> 00:25:16,642
All of this was segment on

594
00:25:16,642 --> 00:25:18,732
market entry, market penetration.

595
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:20,472
What we want to convey to you

596
00:25:20,472 --> 00:25:21,966
as a message is that you need to think

597
00:25:21,966 --> 00:25:24,156
about those elements proactively

598
00:25:24,156 --> 00:25:26,236
and in advance as well because

599
00:25:26,236 --> 00:25:27,962
you want to be smart about them.

600
00:25:27,962 --> 00:25:29,230
The smart entrepreneurs are the ones

601
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,660
who win not the dumb ones.

602
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:32,780
Okay, good luck and see you next time!
