1
00:00:10,279 --> 00:00:12,353
Welcome back,
this is already the final segment

2
00:00:12,353 --> 00:00:14,419
of this week, where I give you a summary

3
00:00:14,419 --> 00:00:17,598
of opportunities and the opportunity
identification process.

4
00:00:17,902 --> 00:00:20,721
During this week we put opportunity
to the center stage

5
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,999
of what we learned
and what we discussed.

6
00:00:22,999 --> 00:00:27,177
This is important, because the opportunity
forms one core element

7
00:00:27,177 --> 00:00:29,234
in your venture creation process.

8
00:00:29,234 --> 00:00:32,060
Let's look at what we did in particular.

9
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:35,380
Remember that the Business Opportunity
and the Venture Team

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,068
are the core elements
of the venture creation process.

11
00:00:38,075 --> 00:00:40,809
The business opportunity as such, for one,

12
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:43,888
presents the fertile ground
on which you create the venture.

13
00:00:44,270 --> 00:00:47,017
Some grounds are more fertile
than others, and we discussed this,

14
00:00:47,017 --> 00:00:50,574
and I'm going to briefly recap
that issue in a couple of minutes.

15
00:00:51,114 --> 00:00:53,878
It also shapes the identity
of your company,

16
00:00:53,878 --> 00:00:55,516
who you are as a firm.

17
00:00:55,834 --> 00:00:58,183
One core element that we discussed
over this last week

18
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,483
is the opportunity exploitation roadmap.

19
00:01:00,483 --> 00:01:02,857
You see it drawn up here on my side,

20
00:01:02,857 --> 00:01:06,023
and it basically shows
that technologies are fungible,

21
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:10,932
meaning that they can be used to cater
to multiple market domains alone,

22
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:14,302
or when combined with other types
of technologies and competences

23
00:01:14,302 --> 00:01:15,800
that you might have.

24
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:20,462
We discussed all of this content
of opportunity exploitation

25
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:24,693
and identification in the context
of technology entrepreneurship,

26
00:01:24,693 --> 00:01:29,677
and oftentimes, at the beginning
of a technology entrepreneurship journey,

27
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:32,106
you have a technology
that you want to commercialize

28
00:01:32,106 --> 00:01:34,826
in search for a market need.

29
00:01:34,826 --> 00:01:38,463
You might wonder, how does this
apply to the other way around,

30
00:01:38,463 --> 00:01:41,588
meaning, you start with a market need
and you do not have a technology yet.

31
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:46,514
Actually, it's not so different here,
because if you think about it,

32
00:01:46,514 --> 00:01:49,853
the process starts with you
having a market insight,

33
00:01:49,853 --> 00:01:51,670
you develop the technology

34
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:55,145
that could be used to cater
to that market domain

35
00:01:55,145 --> 00:01:59,641
that helps you to produce the product
to cater to that market domain,

36
00:01:59,641 --> 00:02:02,276
and you could ask the very same question,

37
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:07,085
"I have all this technology, maybe
given these technological competences,

38
00:02:07,085 --> 00:02:11,118
could I cater to other domains
which might be even more interesting

39
00:02:11,118 --> 00:02:12,922
than the initial one that I saw?"

40
00:02:12,922 --> 00:02:17,443
So this market driven
or this technology driven view

41
00:02:17,443 --> 00:02:22,131
actually oftentimes ends 
in a gray zone where you can do both.

42
00:02:22,131 --> 00:02:23,496
You say, "I have a technology

43
00:02:23,496 --> 00:02:25,546
that allows me to cater
to multiple market domains,"

44
00:02:25,546 --> 00:02:26,902
or "I start with a market

45
00:02:26,902 --> 00:02:31,398
and I see which technologies
could provide that service."

46
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:33,885
In order to understand
technological fungibility,

47
00:02:33,885 --> 00:02:36,747
we had come up with a three step process

48
00:02:37,747 --> 00:02:41,280
that is starting with the understanding

49
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,736
that you typically have
a closely linked technology and market,

50
00:02:44,736 --> 00:02:47,363
and though you develop a technology
particularly with a purpose

51
00:02:47,363 --> 00:02:51,990
and that purpose is a certain market need,
customer need that you had in mind.

52
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,305
In order to understand fungibility
of a technology, however,

53
00:02:55,305 --> 00:02:59,513
you would have to de-link that technology
from the initial market insight,

54
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:02,993
and then re-link it to new market options.

55
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:06,613
Within that process there's
an opportunity identification stage,

56
00:03:06,613 --> 00:03:08,927
and we talked about this
at length as well.

57
00:03:08,927 --> 00:03:13,944
We looked at key factors driving
the opportunity identification process

58
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:16,473
i. e., which opportunities can you see,

59
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:19,078
and which opportunities can't you see.

60
00:03:19,078 --> 00:03:24,193
We saw that this is your alertness,
your knowledge that you already have.

61
00:03:24,198 --> 00:03:27,016
Your knowledge of customer
segments, customer needs,

62
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:29,207
and it was your cognitive flexibility,

63
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:33,189
meaning, can you look at problems
from multiple angles?

64
00:03:33,189 --> 00:03:36,850
Are you able to zoom in 
and zoom out from your problems?

65
00:03:37,969 --> 00:03:45,164
Of all, this provides you with the ability
to identify multiple market opportunities,

66
00:03:45,164 --> 00:03:48,379
but this skill can also be augmented
by reaching outside,

67
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:49,985
trying to involve other players

68
00:03:49,985 --> 00:03:53,654
who might have different
repositories of knowledge

69
00:03:53,654 --> 00:03:56,081
that can benefit you
in opportunity identification,

70
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:58,220
because these people just know
about market needs

71
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:00,069
that you might have never heard of.

72
00:04:00,547 --> 00:04:04,581
In sum, this will produce
or give you then the opportunity to say,

73
00:04:04,581 --> 00:04:07,643
"We have a technology and we link it
to multiple market applications,"

74
00:04:07,643 --> 00:04:09,969
and that's shown
in this bottom chart here.

75
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:12,892
This gives you a number of markets
that you have identified.

76
00:04:12,892 --> 00:04:14,885
The natural question thus arises,

77
00:04:14,885 --> 00:04:17,901
"Which of these market domains provides me

78
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:20,637
with the most fertile ground
for a new firm creation?"

79
00:04:21,587 --> 00:04:26,539
As you remember, not all markets
are as fertile, as helpful, as supportive

80
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:29,176
in firm creation as other markets,

81
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:31,875
so you want to understand which ones
actually produce or give you

82
00:04:31,875 --> 00:04:34,247
the best chances for firm success.

83
00:04:34,247 --> 00:04:38,209
We've listed here on this slide
a couple of these key questions

84
00:04:38,209 --> 00:04:41,580
that help you understand 
your markets, evaluate your markets,

85
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,839
and I don't want to walk you through
all of these elements again.

86
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:48,075
We have covered them very well
and thoroughly in the previous segments,

87
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:49,908
but let's just remind us

88
00:04:49,908 --> 00:04:53,548
that we need to understand
very well on the very micro level

89
00:04:53,548 --> 00:04:56,947
the customer demand, the customer needs,

90
00:04:56,947 --> 00:04:59,312
and we need to understand
on a more macro level,

91
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:01,535
how much demand is out there?

92
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:05,040
How many customers
with that need are out there

93
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:10,185
and would actually be there
to buy our service, our product?

94
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:13,581
This type of analysis 
will then give you the opportunity

95
00:05:13,581 --> 00:05:15,268
to focus on one opportunity,

96
00:05:15,268 --> 00:05:17,866
and you should focus on one opportunity

97
00:05:17,866 --> 00:05:20,689
or at least on very related opportunities,

98
00:05:20,689 --> 00:05:22,834
because you don't want
to spread yourself too thin.

99
00:05:22,834 --> 00:05:25,691
You know you have limited resources
in a start-up, limited attention,

100
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:27,168
so you need to focus.

101
00:05:27,806 --> 00:05:33,311
This will then bring us to the overall
opportunity exploitation roadmap again.

102
00:05:33,311 --> 00:05:37,257
As you see on this slide,
we have identified

103
00:05:37,257 --> 00:05:40,041
the market opportunities
at the initial one,

104
00:05:40,041 --> 00:05:42,854
we have chosen the initial
market opportunity,

105
00:05:42,854 --> 00:05:45,198
and then we can say,
"If this one is successful,

106
00:05:45,198 --> 00:05:49,178
we are sticking to that market
domain to explore it,

107
00:05:49,178 --> 00:05:54,931
and over time, because we are successful,
we can then diversify into other domains,"

108
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:59,522
or what we could do is to say
"if this market should not work out,

109
00:05:59,522 --> 00:06:01,666
we can at least have
this market as a side."

110
00:06:02,314 --> 00:06:05,916
These are a couple of key points
that we discussed during this past week.

111
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:07,285
What I want you to remember

112
00:06:07,285 --> 00:06:10,385
is that entrepreneurship
in that early stage is a process

113
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:13,812
that is shaped by you and the opportunity
that you're seeking to exploit,

114
00:06:13,812 --> 00:06:18,701
by the activity and the domain
that you're engaging in.

115
00:06:19,484 --> 00:06:22,493
But I also want you
to remember one key thing:

116
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,154
you're the entrepreneur, you're in charge.

117
00:06:25,154 --> 00:06:30,212
So, use this type of approach also to look
from the outside onto your venture.

118
00:06:30,212 --> 00:06:33,619
You are in charge of saying,
"I want to go into this market,"

119
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:38,982
"I want to cater to these customers,"
so if something doesn't go right,

120
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:43,100
don't feel like a hamster in a wheel
and keep on running even faster.

121
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:46,144
Step back and look at your venture
from the outside.

122
00:06:46,694 --> 00:06:49,590
Ultimately, that's also one of the most
beautiful parts of entrepreneurship:

123
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:51,806
you're in charge,
you can make the key decisions.

124
00:06:51,806 --> 00:06:55,425
You do not have a boss that tells you
to make this or that decision,

125
00:06:55,425 --> 00:06:57,459
but once in a while,
you have to remind yourself,

126
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:02,462
this is your firm that you're creating
and look at it from the outside.

127
00:07:02,462 --> 00:07:04,905
So with this said, 
the next segment, the next week,

128
00:07:04,905 --> 00:07:07,393
we'll talk about entrepreneurial marketing

129
00:07:07,393 --> 00:07:09,323
and I look forward
to seeing you back then.

130
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:10,540
Thank you.
