1
00:00:11,844 --> 00:00:15,209
Do you remember what we've discussed
in the previous sessions?

2
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:18,531
This segment is actually
a continuation of the core themes

3
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:21,751
that have been pushed forward
in these segments.

4
00:00:21,751 --> 00:00:25,270
Specifically, what we are trying to do
in this segment is to show you

5
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:27,125
how you can test your target market

6
00:00:27,126 --> 00:00:30,493
in order to get a very deep understanding
of your customers' needs,

7
00:00:30,501 --> 00:00:33,777
try to understand whether
the choice you made so far,

8
00:00:33,778 --> 00:00:35,909
that you want to focus
on that target segment,

9
00:00:35,918 --> 00:00:38,827
is actually a feasible one,
one that provides you

10
00:00:38,828 --> 00:00:43,877
with the fertile ground that you need
in order to create a new venture.

11
00:00:44,653 --> 00:00:47,559
A quick recap of what we have done so far.

12
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:49,690
In this graph you actually see

13
00:00:49,691 --> 00:00:53,591
all the different steps
that we have walked through so far.

14
00:00:53,591 --> 00:00:57,040
We have understood
the technological characteristics

15
00:00:57,042 --> 00:01:00,532
that provide you with fungibility
in your technology,

16
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:02,290
meaning that you can address

17
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,578
multiple market domains
with your technology.

18
00:01:04,584 --> 00:01:09,397
We've also discussed how you can identify
multiple market opportunities

19
00:01:09,397 --> 00:01:10,961
based on your technology.

20
00:01:11,249 --> 00:01:14,106
Remember that we've talked
about alertness, prior knowledge, etc.

21
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:18,194
And in the last segment,
we talked about evaluation criteria

22
00:01:18,194 --> 00:01:21,049
that you can apply to understand
which of these target segments

23
00:01:21,049 --> 00:01:23,840
actually provides fertile ground
for firm creation.

24
00:01:24,256 --> 00:01:26,545
We now build on this theme,

25
00:01:26,546 --> 00:01:29,852
but dive much deeper into market analysis

26
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:34,353
because many of the decisions
you have made so far are preliminary.

27
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:36,930
You've based them upon assumptions,

28
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:39,053
and if you base your decisions

29
00:01:39,054 --> 00:01:42,424
on a significant share of assumptions
in your decision making,

30
00:01:42,548 --> 00:01:45,572
then they are preliminary,

31
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:49,555
because you might have gathered
new information, new data

32
00:01:49,556 --> 00:01:53,800
that then questions your assumptions,
provide feedback on your assumptions,

33
00:01:53,801 --> 00:01:56,367
and lets you decide on a more solid basis

34
00:01:56,368 --> 00:01:59,024
whether the target market
you have chosen so far

35
00:01:59,025 --> 00:02:00,766
is actually one that is promising.

36
00:02:01,316 --> 00:02:03,953
We'll last discuss in much detail

37
00:02:03,953 --> 00:02:07,414
ways in which you
can perform market tests,

38
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:12,180
but we also end this segment with
an outlook on your future growth path,

39
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,507
because the opportunities
that you have identified

40
00:02:14,507 --> 00:02:17,193
provide you with some unique
growth possibilities over time,

41
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,215
meaning you can diversify
into these other segments

42
00:02:20,216 --> 00:02:22,397
or these segments
could serve as a plan B

43
00:02:22,397 --> 00:02:28,293
should the first or should another market
not perform as you have foreseen it.

44
00:02:28,778 --> 00:02:30,931
So let me dive more deeply

45
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:34,092
into the market tests
and how you can perform them.

46
00:02:34,433 --> 00:02:37,066
So let's look more closely
at market testing.

47
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:41,041
So far you have identified an opportunity,

48
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:45,136
a market opportunity which is associated
with an unmet customer need.

49
00:02:45,137 --> 00:02:48,626
The question is really,
is this only an assumed need,

50
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:51,719
and how many people
actually have this need?

51
00:02:53,238 --> 00:02:57,017
Oftentimes, an entrepreneur derives
his observations about customers

52
00:02:57,018 --> 00:03:00,783
also from needs that he
or she himself or herself has,

53
00:03:01,542 --> 00:03:04,168
but that might be a need
that's idiosyncratic,

54
00:03:04,201 --> 00:03:06,942
meaning only you have it,
or only few people have it,

55
00:03:06,942 --> 00:03:09,743
and that doesn't provide
fertile ground for your startup.

56
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:12,916
One critical element that you need to do
before committing to a market,

57
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:16,501
especially since you've scarce resources,
limited resources in your firm,

58
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:19,887
is to test your market
and try to understand

59
00:03:19,888 --> 00:03:22,223
whether the concept
you are developing, your product,

60
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:25,192
actually provides a viable solution,

61
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:27,588
and whether you have
a competitive advantage, etc.

62
00:03:27,748 --> 00:03:29,444
Ultimately, we want to understand:

63
00:03:29,444 --> 00:03:33,441
is this fertile ground
for planting the seeds of your firm?

64
00:03:34,887 --> 00:03:36,874
So what is quite important to understand

65
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:40,227
is that your view,
your entrepreneur's view

66
00:03:40,228 --> 00:03:43,101
often doesn't align
with the customers view.

67
00:03:43,102 --> 00:03:45,844
Let's think about the following:
you develop a product.

68
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:49,293
You are very proud of that idea.
You are proud about your product.

69
00:03:49,316 --> 00:03:52,073
You are enthusiastic about it.
You want to show it to others.

70
00:03:52,074 --> 00:03:56,556
You are going there to others and say,
"Wow. Look at what I created."

71
00:03:56,556 --> 00:03:58,244
And there's nothing wrong with that.

72
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:00,076
You should be passionate
about what you do

73
00:04:00,076 --> 00:04:01,961
and you should love what you do.

74
00:04:01,961 --> 00:04:06,305
The only problem is
that you don't take critiques lightly.

75
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:11,639
It's more a personal attack
if someone criticizes your product,

76
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:16,649
which is quite normal, because
you worked so hard on that product.

77
00:04:17,007 --> 00:04:19,511
But there is also a risk,
sort of a trap,

78
00:04:19,511 --> 00:04:22,793
because you want to understand
the customers' view,

79
00:04:22,793 --> 00:04:25,825
you need to understand the customer's view
in order to make the sale.

80
00:04:25,825 --> 00:04:28,098
And if you put yourself
in the customer's shoes,

81
00:04:28,098 --> 00:04:32,519
how does the customer feel
about your product, but more generally,

82
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:36,048
how does the customer
see new products?

83
00:04:36,601 --> 00:04:39,027
So first, their barrier
of attention is high.

84
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:42,877
They are continually flooded
with information.

85
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:46,917
Think about your own information input
that you get each day,

86
00:04:46,917 --> 00:04:51,385
e-mails, newspapers,
Internet websites, Facebook, etc., etc.

87
00:04:52,268 --> 00:04:54,655
So initial brief impressions are decisive

88
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:57,224
to make that informed judgment,

89
00:04:57,224 --> 00:05:00,235
they tend to distrust new things,
and they are stuck in their minds.

90
00:05:00,236 --> 00:05:03,173
They have been using
established products for a long time,

91
00:05:03,173 --> 00:05:07,474
So their view is quite relevant,
their view is typically unknown to you,

92
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:10,496
or at least known not fully,

93
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:13,620
but their view is highly critical
for making that sale.

94
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,742
So what information
you would need to obtain

95
00:05:15,742 --> 00:05:16,842
in order to understand

96
00:05:16,842 --> 00:05:20,527
whether you have an interesting,
promising market in front of you

97
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:24,182
that provides the fertile ground
for firm creation?

98
00:05:24,372 --> 00:05:26,601
There are some key questions
that need to be answered,

99
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:31,527
and actually, some people, especially
if you are a technology entrepreneur,

100
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:34,111
you might be reluctant
or might not have much fun

101
00:05:34,111 --> 00:05:39,606
going out there to talk to customers
and gather all this information.

102
00:05:40,355 --> 00:05:43,783
This is quite understandable
because you weren't trained in that field.

103
00:05:43,783 --> 00:05:47,028
But on the other hand,
look at this as another experiment.

104
00:05:47,028 --> 00:05:50,952
Walk out there, go out there,
talk to different people,

105
00:05:50,952 --> 00:05:52,635
and gather information

106
00:05:52,636 --> 00:05:55,122
--I'll walk you through
some steps later on--

107
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:57,855
but this is actually quite
an interesting intellectual challenge,

108
00:05:57,954 --> 00:06:03,648
meaning, is the product, the vision
I have of my market actually correct?

109
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:07,886
This is like a little test and experiment
that you can do in your lab.

110
00:06:08,035 --> 00:06:11,438
So what key questions
would you like to have answered?

111
00:06:12,212 --> 00:06:15,686
What questions would help you
to improve your concept?

112
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:17,750
First of course, it's demand.

113
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,404
Information about demand,
how strong is the demand.

114
00:06:20,404 --> 00:06:24,901
Remember this nice word, "customer pain"
that we discussed last time.

115
00:06:25,422 --> 00:06:27,612
Demand also has a size component,

116
00:06:27,612 --> 00:06:30,353
how many customers
with that pain out there?

117
00:06:30,782 --> 00:06:34,137
In other words,
do you have a fertile ground

118
00:06:34,137 --> 00:06:37,531
that is large enough to support
the creation of a high growth venture?

119
00:06:38,397 --> 00:06:41,213
Second, you would also like
to understand the competition,

120
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:44,244
and one question that is
particularly intriguing on that front

121
00:06:44,244 --> 00:06:46,885
is the question of what type of products

122
00:06:46,885 --> 00:06:50,401
does your customer compare
your offering to?

123
00:06:50,857 --> 00:06:53,744
This type of question
actually helps you to understand

124
00:06:53,766 --> 00:06:57,844
what is unique about your product
in the eyes of the customers,

125
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,637
not in your eyes.

126
00:06:59,749 --> 00:07:01,832
It also helps you to understand

127
00:07:01,832 --> 00:07:07,001
which type of products might be
out there that could out-compete you.

128
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:10,695
And maybe you could make
your product unique.

129
00:07:10,918 --> 00:07:12,913
That brings us to the third point,

130
00:07:13,437 --> 00:07:15,882
what are customers thinking
about your offering?

131
00:07:15,882 --> 00:07:18,096
About competing offerings?

132
00:07:18,096 --> 00:07:20,192
What makes your offering unique?

133
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,420
This is actually a very critical question

134
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:29,629
because customers choose products
that are unique and typically cheap.

135
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:33,294
So, in that sense you want to understand

136
00:07:33,295 --> 00:07:36,898
whether your offering
has some competitive edge to it.

137
00:07:38,081 --> 00:07:41,057
The customer might even give you
information about ways

138
00:07:41,057 --> 00:07:43,517
how you could improve your uniqueness

139
00:07:43,517 --> 00:07:46,846
that provides you with a stronger
unique selling proposition.

140
00:07:47,157 --> 00:07:51,861
You also want to understand the value
that your product creates for customers.

141
00:07:52,243 --> 00:07:56,150
Remember last time we discussed this
a little bit, when we said, "OK, you need

142
00:07:56,151 --> 00:07:59,546
to understand and quantify
the customer's benefit."

143
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,113
You need to understand
how you can reach the customers,

144
00:08:04,114 --> 00:08:06,162
where would a customer buy the products.

145
00:08:06,162 --> 00:08:08,577
You might have assumptions
but there might be other channels

146
00:08:08,577 --> 00:08:12,572
where the customer buys
products of the type

147
00:08:12,632 --> 00:08:14,784
you are trying to sell more frequently.

148
00:08:14,784 --> 00:08:19,003
Finally, you also want to understand
which marketing tools might work best.

149
00:08:19,003 --> 00:08:21,777
And there are other issues, too:
regulations exist,

150
00:08:21,777 --> 00:08:24,343
are there some key processes
that you need to understand?

151
00:08:24,343 --> 00:08:27,000
So when you look at all these questions
this looks like a lot.

152
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:30,320
Granted, but this is actually
quite interesting to understand

153
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:34,027
because this provides you
with so much valuable information

154
00:08:34,027 --> 00:08:37,711
on your journey to become
a successful entrepreneur.

155
00:08:37,712 --> 00:08:40,056
As I said, see this
as an intellectual challenge,

156
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:43,945
and see this as fun, because the customers
out there aren't the enemy,

157
00:08:43,945 --> 00:08:46,039
they are ultimately your friends,

158
00:08:46,042 --> 00:08:50,668
and they are the ones allowing you
to create your successful venture,

159
00:08:50,669 --> 00:08:56,400
that are actually transforming you,
hopefully, into a successful entrepreneur,

160
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:59,922
and maybe also, [help you]
get another lifestyle.

161
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:03,612
What do you need to do in order to gather
all of this valuable information?

162
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,843
In the few next slides, I'm going to
present 7 key steps to test your market.

163
00:09:09,496 --> 00:09:12,191
These steps include:
developing a prototype,

164
00:09:12,362 --> 00:09:16,783
desk research, field research,
cost estimates,

165
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:19,548
pricing, how you reach your customer,

166
00:09:19,548 --> 00:09:22,962
and finally, the analysis
that is based on all of these elements.

167
00:09:23,522 --> 00:09:25,442
So let's look at those more closely.

168
00:09:25,459 --> 00:09:29,727
The first main step that you need
to accomplish is prototype development.

169
00:09:29,727 --> 00:09:33,036
This is actually a fun step
because you are working on your product,

170
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:35,237
you are working of the design
of your product,

171
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:37,475
and it's important to get as close

172
00:09:37,475 --> 00:09:41,985
to what you think is the offering
that the customer likes most,

173
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:44,839
because the customer needs
to imagine your offering.

174
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,931
And the more the customer
can imagine your offering,

175
00:09:47,932 --> 00:09:51,406
the better he will be giving you feedback.

176
00:09:51,407 --> 00:09:54,966
And more valid that feedback will be
and more helpful it will be for you.

177
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:57,947
The second key step
that you want to perform

178
00:09:57,948 --> 00:10:01,251
is some preliminary
market research from your desk.

179
00:10:01,252 --> 00:10:06,307
You will find that key information
primarily surfing the Internet,

180
00:10:06,428 --> 00:10:10,344
but some agencies also
can provide that in written format,

181
00:10:10,344 --> 00:10:12,070
they publish reports, etc.

182
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:15,004
So you might get that
from your statistical offices,

183
00:10:15,004 --> 00:10:17,167
from government agencies, etc.

184
00:10:17,442 --> 00:10:20,148
What it is important to understand

185
00:10:20,148 --> 00:10:22,720
is that some geographies
in which you are located

186
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:26,796
might not have much information
so readily available.

187
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:30,099
What to do in that situation?

188
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:33,092
You might say, "OK, it's just
nothing around.

189
00:10:33,093 --> 00:10:34,811
I give up on that one."

190
00:10:34,811 --> 00:10:36,652
But actually, the good entrepreneurs say,

191
00:10:36,652 --> 00:10:38,851
"OK, maybe there is
other type of information

192
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:41,144
that could help me understand
my market better.

193
00:10:41,436 --> 00:10:42,996
And this doesn't necessarily mean

194
00:10:42,996 --> 00:10:46,086
I need to have information about
my geographical market,"

195
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:49,697
--in case you are launching
your venture in a particular country,

196
00:10:49,698 --> 00:10:51,540
and there's just not
so much information available there--

197
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,616
You might reach out to other countries.

198
00:10:53,616 --> 00:10:57,507
Some countries might be leading
your technological development,

199
00:10:57,508 --> 00:11:01,593
There might be more
advanced information available

200
00:11:01,594 --> 00:11:06,176
about customer tastes, market trends,
so you can actually learn

201
00:11:06,177 --> 00:11:09,357
from other geographies
about your own market.

202
00:11:09,358 --> 00:11:12,965
This is not underestimating,
and as I said, is providing you

203
00:11:12,966 --> 00:11:16,294
with, at least, some
information to work with.

204
00:11:16,295 --> 00:11:21,608
Desk research can never compensate
other types of research, field research,

205
00:11:21,609 --> 00:11:23,901
and we'll come to that in the next step.

206
00:11:23,902 --> 00:11:26,641
The third key step is
what's going into the field.

207
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:31,242
Not yet to the customer,
but going into stores, into outlets

208
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,944
going into all kinds of physical spaces,

209
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:41,223
where you can try to collect information
your competitive arena.

210
00:11:41,224 --> 00:11:44,206
Think about the competitive offerings
that are out there;

211
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:46,394
you can understand the prices,

212
00:11:46,395 --> 00:11:49,481
how competitors advertise their offerings,

213
00:11:49,482 --> 00:11:53,662
what type of advertising
might work better than others,

214
00:11:53,663 --> 00:11:57,281
observe prospective clients in the store.

215
00:11:57,282 --> 00:12:01,290
Try to also understand how could
the competition distribute the goods?

216
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,985
When we are talking about the competition,

217
00:12:03,986 --> 00:12:08,835
this is defined very narrowly
as those firms competing head to head,

218
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:11,350
but you can also have
a broader understanding and say,

219
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:18,953
"OK, maybe there are ways of distribution
that are done by firms in other industries

220
00:12:19,516 --> 00:12:24,886
that might be superior to my way
of current distribution system,

221
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:26,286
in my industry,"

222
00:12:26,286 --> 00:12:29,800
so, in that sense, you could learn
from other distribution models,

223
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:32,830
other advertising models,
other pricing models,

224
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:35,984
by looking beyond
your industry boundaries.

225
00:12:35,985 --> 00:12:39,156
So going into the field means, one,

226
00:12:39,157 --> 00:12:42,830
"Yes, I understand
the competition in my own domain,

227
00:12:42,831 --> 00:12:44,821
"but I also let me inspire

228
00:12:44,834 --> 00:12:49,031
"by how other industries are performing
these very same activities,

229
00:12:49,032 --> 00:12:52,798
and are making the very same decisions
that we are looking at here."

230
00:12:53,188 --> 00:12:56,028
As the next step
estimate your own costs.

231
00:12:56,493 --> 00:13:00,313
In other words, how much would it cost
to get your offering to the market.

232
00:13:00,314 --> 00:13:05,286
This is not yet to be confused
with the pricing of your product,

233
00:13:05,287 --> 00:13:08,045
this is a different issue
that we would talk about in the next step.

234
00:13:08,045 --> 00:13:09,791
Let's just try to understand,

235
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:13,911
"How much would I actually have
to expend for my product?"

236
00:13:13,912 --> 00:13:16,881
You need to research
the price for supplies, for instance,

237
00:13:16,882 --> 00:13:19,481
how much the production
distribution costs would be,

238
00:13:19,482 --> 00:13:22,463
how much office space,
salaries would cost,

239
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:27,692
and maybe, if you are fearing losses,
theft, you have to calculate that as well.

240
00:13:28,549 --> 00:13:32,668
Do not forget to include
your own labor costs into that estimation

241
00:13:32,669 --> 00:13:35,720
because you want to pay yourself
ultimately a salary, as well.

242
00:13:35,809 --> 00:13:38,126
But all of these points
give you an understanding

243
00:13:38,126 --> 00:13:41,165
"Well, how much is the cost
of my own goods?"

244
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,597
until they are with the customer,

245
00:13:43,598 --> 00:13:47,522
and this provides you with some indication
whether you can be profitable over time.

246
00:13:47,688 --> 00:13:52,011
As a next step you will turn
to understanding the pricing level.

247
00:13:52,012 --> 00:13:55,353
We have written here on that slide
your potential price level

248
00:13:55,354 --> 00:13:58,260
and this potential
is very, very important,

249
00:13:58,261 --> 00:14:02,833
because you need to have some idea
about your potential price,

250
00:14:02,901 --> 00:14:07,076
if you move out in the field
in the next step and talk to customers.

251
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:11,566
So you need to come up
with a valid idea of your price level,

252
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:14,123
but this is also an idea
that might change over time

253
00:14:14,124 --> 00:14:17,300
once you get to know
the customers' reaction to your product,

254
00:14:17,301 --> 00:14:21,133
the customer need
in a much more deeper way.

255
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:23,235
Frequently, entrepreneurs say,

256
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,625
"I will use this type of approaches
that I listed here."

257
00:14:26,626 --> 00:14:28,293
They do Cost-plus approach,

258
00:14:28,299 --> 00:14:31,457
so they might say, "I add 10%
to the cost of my product,

259
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:33,659
and this will be my price."

260
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,813
Or they will say, "I use
the price of the competition,

261
00:14:36,814 --> 00:14:40,203
and I subtract 10%
so my product is more attractive."

262
00:14:40,855 --> 00:14:44,352
Or they will do a very timid,
which means low pricing

263
00:14:44,353 --> 00:14:49,694
which ultimately leads
to products that are cheap,

264
00:14:49,854 --> 00:14:53,495
but that means you might
leave money on the table that way.

265
00:14:53,495 --> 00:14:55,625
So why are these approaches problematic?

266
00:14:55,642 --> 00:14:58,993
These approaches are problematic
because of various reasons,

267
00:14:58,994 --> 00:15:02,422
and I think the primary reason is
because they do not take into account

268
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:05,679
the value that you create
with your offering to customers.

269
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,820
Think about the following:
in a Cost-plus approach, you might say,

270
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:12,898
"This product costs 20% above my costs."

271
00:15:13,997 --> 00:15:17,037
But in fact, you create
much, much more value to the customer,

272
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:20,721
so the customer would be willing
to pay much, much more for your product.

273
00:15:20,949 --> 00:15:22,355
This also means,

274
00:15:22,356 --> 00:15:27,506
"Hey, I leave money on the table.
The customer would pay me more."

275
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:30,594
Similar, the price of competitors.

276
00:15:30,594 --> 00:15:33,617
If you have a product
that out-competes other products,

277
00:15:33,617 --> 00:15:35,552
why not charge more?

278
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:39,562
And the same story
with a very timid or low pricing.

279
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:44,044
In that sense, take into account,
and take this to heart:

280
00:15:44,044 --> 00:15:47,235
try to understand the value
that you are creating to your customers.

281
00:15:47,235 --> 00:15:49,552
In the next step, step 6,

282
00:15:49,553 --> 00:15:51,826
you actually reach out
to customers in your market.

283
00:15:52,528 --> 00:15:56,451
This is actually a fun step,
a step where you can learn a lot.

284
00:15:57,024 --> 00:15:58,664
It's fun because you finally meet

285
00:15:58,664 --> 00:16:01,682
those people that are
your potential customers,

286
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:04,667
those who will support
the creation of your company,

287
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,481
so these are vital people.

288
00:16:06,928 --> 00:16:10,781
It's also an intellectually
interesting, stimulating activity

289
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:15,501
because the customers might confirm
or dis-confirm your assumptions.

290
00:16:16,635 --> 00:16:18,913
Don't be sad
if they dis-confirm your assumption;

291
00:16:18,913 --> 00:16:20,807
see this as a learning opportunity.

292
00:16:20,807 --> 00:16:22,886
This is quite important to realize.

293
00:16:23,022 --> 00:16:25,188
Imagine if a customer gives you

294
00:16:25,189 --> 00:16:27,135
negative feedback
on some product features,

295
00:16:27,135 --> 00:16:28,794
You could be devastated.

296
00:16:28,795 --> 00:16:32,538
Many of you would be devastated
because, as we said before,

297
00:16:32,539 --> 00:16:35,903
this is your baby, this is something
that you developed for months and months

298
00:16:35,903 --> 00:16:38,231
and then the customer comes
and gives you negative feedback.

299
00:16:38,336 --> 00:16:40,692
But see the flip side to that.

300
00:16:40,693 --> 00:16:44,595
You have now an important
learning opportunity ahead of you,

301
00:16:44,741 --> 00:16:47,002
you can adjust your product,

302
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:50,755
and you can fit your product better
to the customer's needs.

303
00:16:51,506 --> 00:16:54,730
And this is good to happen early on
in the venturing process

304
00:16:54,731 --> 00:16:57,597
and not when you have spent
lots of time and lots of funds

305
00:16:57,598 --> 00:17:00,297
on exploiting an opportunity
only then to realize

306
00:17:00,297 --> 00:17:03,345
that the market you have thought
would be there, doesn't exist.

307
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:07,460
So a good rule of thumb would be
that in a fairly homogenous market

308
00:17:07,474 --> 00:17:11,194
that you are talking to 50 customers
and trying to collect feedback

309
00:17:11,195 --> 00:17:13,592
on all these dimensions
that we discussed before.

310
00:17:13,592 --> 00:17:16,977
In a B2B setting,
this could be fewer companies

311
00:17:16,978 --> 00:17:19,833
because there might be fewer out there.

312
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:22,417
What is important there is to realize

313
00:17:22,419 --> 00:17:27,236
"I need to get in touch with that person
who ultimately makes the buying decision."

314
00:17:29,064 --> 00:17:33,448
Not anyone in the organization,
but who is deciding upon this purchase?

315
00:17:33,449 --> 00:17:36,078
This might be a group of people,

316
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,907
but try to understand their preferences,

317
00:17:37,918 --> 00:17:40,362
try to understand
their decision making rationales,

318
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:43,677
because that will help you to tailor
your offering, your marketing tools,

319
00:17:43,678 --> 00:17:47,282
your marketing strategy
to the needs of the customers.

320
00:17:48,232 --> 00:17:52,552
So, finally, in step 7, you come home
with lost of data that you've collected.

321
00:17:52,553 --> 00:17:56,208
You've collected data from your desk,

322
00:17:56,209 --> 00:17:58,731
data on the competition in the field,

323
00:17:58,732 --> 00:18:01,758
you've collected data
from customers directly.

324
00:18:02,293 --> 00:18:04,663
These many data point provide you

325
00:18:04,664 --> 00:18:08,540
with some solid background
in order to make more informed decisions.

326
00:18:09,639 --> 00:18:15,209
These types of data can be confronted with
the assumptions you had before and say,

327
00:18:15,209 --> 00:18:20,127
"OK, maybe some of them about the market,
the customers, about the distribution,

328
00:18:20,128 --> 00:18:22,598
that I held before, are not correct,

329
00:18:22,598 --> 00:18:24,370
and need to be adjust
in this or that way."

330
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:29,184
As I said regarding the previous slide,
this is not negative information,

331
00:18:29,185 --> 00:18:31,886
this is a learning opportunity
to advance and improve,

332
00:18:31,886 --> 00:18:33,640
to get from good to great.

333
00:18:35,669 --> 00:18:39,759
Maybe not all of the information
and data that you've collected

334
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,662
is equally important.

335
00:18:41,663 --> 00:18:45,624
What is particularly important, however,
are the comments from your customers.

336
00:18:45,884 --> 00:18:48,440
Take them to heart.
They are priceless in a way,

337
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:52,088
because these people will ultimately spend
their hard-earned money

338
00:18:52,088 --> 00:18:53,674
on buying your offering,

339
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:57,493
So you need to understand how they tick,
what they prefer, what they don't like,

340
00:18:57,493 --> 00:18:59,672
and what they like
about competing products.

341
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,318
But ultimately,
avoid paralysis by analysis.

342
00:19:03,318 --> 00:19:05,783
You can only analyze your data so much

343
00:19:05,784 --> 00:19:09,854
before going into the field
and launching your product.

344
00:19:09,855 --> 00:19:11,901
You will never understand how

345
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:15,108
the competition reacts to your offering
unless you enter the market.

346
00:19:15,881 --> 00:19:18,866
So there is only so much you can do
in market testing,

347
00:19:19,118 --> 00:19:22,194
even with solid customer information.

348
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:24,752
Just be aware of that limitation.

349
00:19:25,368 --> 00:19:29,631
So the seven steps should provide you
with some solid information

350
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:33,397
regarding the target market
you've so far envisioned for your venture.

351
00:19:34,587 --> 00:19:37,807
You need to ask yourself
exactly that same question

352
00:19:37,808 --> 00:19:39,708
that we have put up there on that slide:

353
00:19:39,709 --> 00:19:42,404
What does the analysis tell you
about your chosen market?

354
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:46,501
Is this the fertile ground
for my venture creation process?

355
00:19:47,668 --> 00:19:51,314
Would I have to pivot to another domain?

356
00:19:51,568 --> 00:19:54,310
And this is quite important here.

357
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:56,735
Is there a plan B?

358
00:19:57,441 --> 00:19:58,686
And yes, there's a plan B.

359
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,292
Coming back to the initial
opportunity exploitation roadmap.

360
00:20:02,904 --> 00:20:05,447
This is the plan B.
You can say,

361
00:20:05,447 --> 00:20:10,983
"This initial target market
that I tested does not hold.

362
00:20:11,185 --> 00:20:13,114
It's just not there."

363
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:15,543
And this is, as I said, not a bad outcome,

364
00:20:15,543 --> 00:20:21,040
it's an outcome that has cost you
some energy, some worry, maybe,

365
00:20:21,385 --> 00:20:26,514
but it's better now to fail,
before you have had lots of expenses,

366
00:20:26,515 --> 00:20:30,947
and say, "OK, I skip this market,
but I move into another market domain."

367
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:35,443
And that another market domain
might be this market up here.

368
00:20:35,758 --> 00:20:37,532
It could be plan B.

369
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,972
Or, if-- let's do it differently--,
if this market actually was a good one,

370
00:20:44,641 --> 00:20:50,786
you could then say, "OK, in period 2,
I will stay of course in that market,

371
00:20:50,786 --> 00:20:53,853
but I also will enter another one."

372
00:20:54,001 --> 00:20:58,245
That was that market here, was basically

373
00:20:58,246 --> 00:21:00,518
the stepping stone
to get to another market.

374
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:07,638
This provides you with some interesting
exploitation possibilities going forward,

375
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:11,509
because when you think about the time,

376
00:21:11,509 --> 00:21:13,638
this might be a couple of years here,

377
00:21:13,638 --> 00:21:17,159
there is an exciting growth story
associated with your venture

378
00:21:17,254 --> 00:21:19,312
that you might not have had,

379
00:21:19,433 --> 00:21:22,517
if you only have looked at
one market opportunity.

380
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:29,808
There is also an exciting
value creation story here,

381
00:21:30,077 --> 00:21:34,568
but there's also an interesting
risk mitigation strategy here,

382
00:21:34,639 --> 00:21:36,416
because as I said previously,

383
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:40,611
if this market here doesn't work out,
we have a plan B in store.

384
00:21:40,859 --> 00:21:42,628
This plan B is up here.

385
00:21:44,775 --> 00:21:47,722
So, in other words, if you come up

386
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:51,062
with this more sophisticated way
of creating your venture,

387
00:21:51,427 --> 00:21:57,377
you have foreseen future growth options
and you have also mitigated your risks

388
00:21:57,377 --> 00:22:00,574
which is what good
entrepreneurs always do.

389
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:06,309
With that said, you have an exciting
intellectual challenge in front of you,

390
00:22:06,754 --> 00:22:08,859
exciting activities in front of you.

391
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:15,768
What I want you to do is to think
creatively and carefully beyond the steps,

392
00:22:15,769 --> 00:22:19,116
and try to understand
what does this mean for my venture.

393
00:22:19,344 --> 00:22:21,783
Good luck with that!
See you next time.
