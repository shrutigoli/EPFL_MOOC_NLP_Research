00:00:00,453 --> 00:00:03,870
Welcome back to week two,
this is segment 2.1

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,248
"Linking Technologies and Markets:
Key Issues," and in particular,

3
00:00:07,249 --> 00:00:09,748
we're going to talk about
products and underlying technologies.

4
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:12,418
- Here with me is Chris Tucci.
- Thanks.

5
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:15,743
It's another upgrade
in the height department here.

6
00:00:15,744 --> 00:00:19,614
- Looking very tall today.
- Yeah, we're alike.

7
00:00:19,615 --> 00:00:22,791
So what we will be doing today
with this segment

8
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:25,834
is to introduce you to the term
technological fungibility

9
00:00:25,846 --> 00:00:28,822
and what it actually means
for the creation of high tech ventures.

10
00:00:28,823 --> 00:00:33,920
When you think about that in more detail,
this is explained very well on this slide.

11
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:37,868
Technologies can be combined
with other technologies to form products.

12
00:00:37,869 --> 00:00:40,621
So underlying a product
are different sorts of technologies,

13
00:00:40,622 --> 00:00:42,964
but when you recombine these technologies

14
00:00:42,965 --> 00:00:47,334
- you see it here, technology B,
and C, D, E, and A -

15
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:49,077
when you recombine these elements,

16
00:00:49,078 --> 00:00:51,805
you might be able
to create another type of product

17
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:55,738
which then can cater
to another set of end customers.

18
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,790
This is the whole logic
of technological fungibility

19
00:00:58,791 --> 00:01:02,264
that we have discussed
in management since the 1950s,

20
00:01:02,265 --> 00:01:04,798
which means one:

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,038
sets of technologies can serve
multiple markets,

22
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:10,152
so, from a technology
entrepreneur's perspective

23
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:14,136
your underlying competence
in a technology can actually be used

24
00:01:14,137 --> 00:01:16,150
to cater to multiple market domains.

25
00:01:16,151 --> 00:01:18,645
And that's beautiful
because many of these domains

26
00:01:18,646 --> 00:01:21,515
might be better than the one
that you thought of.

27
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:24,660
(Chris) So in this particular
graphic here then--

28
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:29,626
so this product is based
on A, C, E and D--

29
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:30,776
Exactly.

30
00:01:30,777 --> 00:01:33,766
...and E is also used
in the second product over here,

31
00:01:33,767 --> 00:01:36,486
and B is also used
in this third one, along with D.

32
00:01:36,487 --> 00:01:40,493
(Marc) Exactly, that gives you a lot
of flexibility in your venture creation

33
00:01:40,494 --> 00:01:42,991
because you can say:
"My technology is fungible

34
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:45,884
and it can render purposes
for multiple sets of customers.

35
00:01:45,885 --> 00:01:47,663
What the interesting point is

36
00:01:47,664 --> 00:01:49,778
- we will come back to it
later in another segment -

37
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:53,988
is that all these end customer markets
typically have different properties.

38
00:01:53,989 --> 00:01:56,846
Some of these markets
will be better ground,

39
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:58,927
more fertile ground
for creation than others.

40
00:01:58,928 --> 00:02:00,887
We will discuss that
in a separate segment,

41
00:02:00,888 --> 00:02:04,089
but that's beauty
of having fungible technologies

42
00:02:04,090 --> 00:02:06,740
or fungible competence in that sense.

43
00:02:06,741 --> 00:02:08,996
We start here thinking about technology,

44
00:02:09,006 --> 00:02:10,800
but you can also start here
on the right-side

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,871
with thinking about an end-user customer

46
00:02:12,872 --> 00:02:15,108
and say OK, in order to cater
to that end customer,

47
00:02:15,125 --> 00:02:18,674
you need to develop a product
with underlying technolgies,

48
00:02:18,675 --> 00:02:20,807
but once you're working
on the technologies,

49
00:02:20,808 --> 00:02:23,650
you might have the idea
that this could actually be used

50
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:27,203
to serve other end customers,
if we have different sorts of products.

51
00:02:27,204 --> 00:02:32,096
So the independent way actually starts
on the right-side here, on the left side,

52
00:02:32,097 --> 00:02:36,948
this is a process that gives you
flexibility as an entrepreneur,

53
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,230
and that is something
where you as an entrepreneur

54
00:02:39,231 --> 00:02:41,474
can have a lot of impact
on how your firm is created

55
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:43,314
and how your firm
ultimately will look like.

56
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:45,233
Let's look at a concrete example here.

57
00:02:45,234 --> 00:02:50,314
This is Canon, a company that makes
different kinds of camera devices.

58
00:02:51,334 --> 00:02:57,240
This is the classic story
from the Prahalad and Hammel article

59
00:02:57,241 --> 00:02:58,530
from years ago,

60
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:02,672
that basically shows that they have
expertise in certain areas,

61
00:03:02,673 --> 00:03:06,922
precision mechanics, fine optics,
and microelectronics.

62
00:03:06,923 --> 00:03:09,709
Looking at this graphic more closely,

63
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:12,778
you can see that for a basic camera here,

64
00:03:12,779 --> 00:03:17,436
you just need precision
mechanics and fine optics.

65
00:03:17,437 --> 00:03:20,720
These precision mechanics are going
through everything that they're doing,

66
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:22,419
so we just think about
this column here,

67
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:24,162
this is really covering everything.

68
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:26,317
Then there are certain other
combinations with things

69
00:03:26,317 --> 00:03:29,333
that enable them to make
specific products.

70
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:34,126
If you think about microelectronics here,
for example an autofocus camera,

71
00:03:34,148 --> 00:03:39,285
requires all three of these
different kinds of competencies.

72
00:03:39,286 --> 00:03:42,822
(Marc) And that, if you move back
to the last slide and think about it,

73
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,899
that is exactly technological fungibility.

74
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:48,074
You have precision mechanics
as one technological competence

75
00:03:48,075 --> 00:03:50,009
you combine with
other types of competences

76
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,906
and then this provides you
with a different type of product,

77
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:55,218
and this can render
a different type of service.

78
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:59,243
So, you can think of your company
as possessing competences,

79
00:03:59,244 --> 00:04:01,773
this is a young company
that possesses competences,

80
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:04,151
of course, you want
to develop some others

81
00:04:04,152 --> 00:04:07,238
but you have competences as well,
and these are fungible,

82
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:08,548
and it's not God-given

83
00:04:08,549 --> 00:04:12,689
that you only focus on one product
with one market domain attached to it,

84
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,657
there could be lots of opportunities.

85
00:04:14,658 --> 00:04:17,228
(Chris) In fact, here you can see
there are certain other things

86
00:04:17,228 --> 00:04:18,885
that are quite different from cameras;

87
00:04:18,886 --> 00:04:22,547
the laser fax, for example,
or a plain paper copier,

88
00:04:22,548 --> 00:04:27,483
it's not exactly the same market
as the cameras.

89
00:04:27,484 --> 00:04:30,323
Therefore, it can be used
to combine, make different things,

90
00:04:30,324 --> 00:04:31,920
and attacking different markets.

91
00:04:31,921 --> 00:04:34,127
(Marc) Looking into
the future of this MOOC,

92
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:37,287
these types of product markets
that you're looking at here

93
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:39,262
have different types of features.

94
00:04:39,263 --> 00:04:40,943
Some are growing, some are declining,

95
00:04:40,944 --> 00:04:43,625
some [inaudible] are growing
from creation than others.

96
00:04:43,626 --> 00:04:46,775
Of course this is a larger company,
but here we only try to make this point

97
00:04:46,776 --> 00:04:50,696
that technologies are fungible
and can cater to multiple domains.

98
00:04:50,697 --> 00:04:53,991
So let's look at another example,
it's a famous example,

99
00:04:53,992 --> 00:04:56,269
it's the heat shield tiles
from the space shuttle.

100
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:59,476
It's a ceramic that is used
to protect the space shuttle

101
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:03,838
when it reenters the orbit
from going up in flames.

102
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,037
Because bad thinks happen
and they fall off.

103
00:05:07,038 --> 00:05:10,872
But the main point that we want to make

104
00:05:10,873 --> 00:05:13,679
is this ceramic has certain properties,

105
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,527
it can be used
to protect the space shuttle.

106
00:05:16,528 --> 00:05:17,787
But how many would you sell?

107
00:05:17,788 --> 00:05:20,004
You'd probably sell
10,000 for a space shuttle?

108
00:05:20,005 --> 00:05:22,700
Times four space shuttles
when they're still flying.

109
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:26,041
So you're starting at an overall 40,000.

110
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:28,839
This is a limited market
- it's a cool market of course -

111
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,933
but it's limited.

112
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:32,043
So if you are creating
a high growth venture,

113
00:05:32,044 --> 00:05:33,609
you might want to ask yourself,

114
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:38,783
is this the right market to create
that type of growth that I'm aspiring to?

115
00:05:38,784 --> 00:05:41,765
If you look at it, it might be

116
00:05:41,766 --> 00:05:44,190
a stepping stone to something
bigger and better,

117
00:05:44,191 --> 00:05:45,970
but it's not the growth market

118
00:05:45,971 --> 00:05:51,444
that will allow you to grow your company
into a billion dollar enterprise as such.

119
00:05:51,445 --> 00:05:55,455
So thinking about this ceramic
in a bit more detail,

120
00:05:55,456 --> 00:05:57,747
that there are other
applications that arise.

121
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:59,277
Let's look at those.

122
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:02,051
So to analyze this
you might want to ask yourself,

123
00:06:02,052 --> 00:06:06,687
what application areas
could this technology be used in?

124
00:06:06,688 --> 00:06:10,657
We did a little brainstorming here,
the first three things that we thought of:

125
00:06:10,658 --> 00:06:14,213
it could be used in catalytic converters,
for example in a car,

126
00:06:14,214 --> 00:06:17,904
it could be used in refrigerators,
and maybe used in chimneys.

127
00:06:17,905 --> 00:06:20,793
So while each of these may be better

128
00:06:20,794 --> 00:06:25,716
than selling a limited number
to a small number of space shuttles,

129
00:06:26,709 --> 00:06:30,084
they may have very, very,
quite different characteristics

130
00:06:30,085 --> 00:06:33,265
to make them attractive
to the entrepreneur.

131
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:36,310
So the catalytic converter
sounds very good

132
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,680
because it could be a huge market.

133
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,795
On the other hand,

134
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:43,015
competition could be very intense
in the auto parts supplier industry.

135
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:45,874
So there's a big market
with a lot of competition.

136
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:48,897
You may have less competition
in refrigerators,

137
00:06:48,898 --> 00:06:50,850
maybe a bigger market in chimneys, etc.,

138
00:06:50,851 --> 00:06:55,309
so you go through this one step at a time,
trying to analyze what's the best place

139
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:58,572
to put my technology in terms
of the opportunity space.

140
00:06:58,573 --> 00:07:01,336
Exactly, and what's particularly
intriguing, if you think about it,

141
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:05,601
is that you're not only selecting
the most fertile ground for fund creation

142
00:07:05,602 --> 00:07:07,876
- some markets are
more favorable than others -

143
00:07:07,877 --> 00:07:10,408
but you're also shaping
the identity of your company,

144
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:12,358
what we call organizational identity.

145
00:07:12,359 --> 00:07:17,056
Because if you think about it,
if you cater to the aerospace industry,

146
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:19,581
your company will be looking
quite different

147
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:21,362
than if you cater with your technology

148
00:07:21,363 --> 00:07:24,495
to the chimney market
or the refrigerator market.

149
00:07:24,496 --> 00:07:26,686
You will be hiring
different types of people,

150
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:29,533
different people will find
your company good to work for

151
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:31,483
when you're working
with the aerospace industry,

152
00:07:31,484 --> 00:07:34,793
and some others might say,
I want to work for a refrigerator company.

153
00:07:34,794 --> 00:07:39,131
You have different sorts of supplier
and distribution relationships.

154
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:42,785
Altogether they are shaping
who you are as a company,

155
00:07:42,786 --> 00:07:46,631
and that's a very fundamental question
beyond the performance question.

156
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:49,665
Thinking about this in a structured way,

157
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:53,779
this is maybe one of the most
important and fundamental decisions

158
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:57,713
that you ever will engage in
in your early entrepreneurial journey.

159
00:07:57,714 --> 00:08:00,945
So in that sense, it's worthwhile
looking at that in more detail,

160
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:03,418
as a process of re-linking and de-linking.

161
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:04,703
So let's do that.

162
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:08,603
So this process can be conceptualized
as a process of de-linking and re-linking.

163
00:08:08,604 --> 00:08:11,961
We're going to explain to the user
that process in the next two slides,

164
00:08:11,962 --> 00:08:13,782
but let's do it one by one.

165
00:08:13,783 --> 00:08:18,328
Oftentimes, when you think about it,
technology is developed with a purpose,

166
00:08:18,334 --> 00:08:21,998
meaning there's a market idea oftentimes
in the mind of the entrepreneur.

167
00:08:21,999 --> 00:08:25,732
So there is often times a close link
between technology and market.

168
00:08:25,733 --> 00:08:28,865
Because it's oftentimes
the starting point,

169
00:08:28,866 --> 00:08:31,428
you have to engage in another step
in order to understand

170
00:08:31,429 --> 00:08:34,698
the spectrum of possibilities
that is awaiting you with the technology.

171
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:37,157
(Chris) So that would be like
de-linking the process step.

172
00:08:37,158 --> 00:08:39,695
So you want to understand
the technological resources

173
00:08:39,696 --> 00:08:41,412
in their own right.

174
00:08:41,413 --> 00:08:43,917
So when is this technology general?

175
00:08:43,918 --> 00:08:47,127
When is it specific?
What's unique about it?

176
00:08:47,128 --> 00:08:50,666
How could it be adapted, changed
a little bit, moved around, expanded?

177
00:08:50,667 --> 00:08:54,438
What are some of the components of it?
How can we use this technology?

178
00:08:54,439 --> 00:08:56,796
So we're trying to be a little bit
more open minded,

179
00:08:56,797 --> 00:08:59,160
even though you start
with something in mind,

180
00:08:59,161 --> 00:09:02,663
you might want to then analyze
how it could be used in other places.

181
00:09:02,664 --> 00:09:05,373
(Marc) Think about this
[precision scope] that we spoke of.

182
00:09:05,374 --> 00:09:07,073
Think about the Canon example.

183
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:10,424
Think about these competences
in their own right.

184
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,249
What can they do?
What are the properties of them?

185
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,701
So you have to decouple
the technological resource, in a way,

186
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,254
from your market application,
so you cut them.

187
00:09:18,255 --> 00:09:22,025
Think about the technology
that they're coupled with.

188
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:24,434
In the next step then, you would say,

189
00:09:24,435 --> 00:09:29,627
"I relink my technology
with other possible market applications."

190
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:35,364
So it's the basis for understanding
your application spectrum,

191
00:09:35,365 --> 00:09:39,025
but it also depends on whether
you can see other opportunities.

192
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:41,088
That's also not a given,

193
00:09:41,089 --> 00:09:44,522
it means you have to go out there and try
to understand where can it be applied.

194
00:09:44,523 --> 00:09:47,756
If you look at this type of problem,
which is a very interesting one,

195
00:09:47,757 --> 00:09:50,935
and a very rewarding one
if you are successful at it,

196
00:09:50,936 --> 00:09:52,455
- in the next segment -

197
00:09:52,456 --> 00:09:57,410
but for now, think about this
as a process of de-linking and re-linking,

198
00:09:57,411 --> 00:09:59,214
because then you can understand

199
00:09:59,215 --> 00:10:02,485
your company, the basis of your
company creation in a more systematic way.

200
00:10:02,486 --> 00:10:05,304
I think it's part of the entrepreneurial
mindset in some ways

201
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,206
to try and imagine other uses.

202
00:10:07,207 --> 00:10:10,191
I think a lot of people come up
with something that's technology

203
00:10:10,192 --> 00:10:14,074
and then become fixated
on the first application they think of.

204
00:10:14,075 --> 00:10:15,874
Whereas, what this is encouraging us to do

205
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:18,821
is to really think that through
to try to think of the other applications.

206
00:10:18,821 --> 00:10:21,354
That's quite an important point
because there's tons of research

207
00:10:21,354 --> 00:10:24,552
that actually shows that those people
who are really good at entrepreneurship

208
00:10:24,553 --> 00:10:26,408
have this cognitive versatility.

209
00:10:26,409 --> 00:10:28,448
They can look at stuff
from different angles

210
00:10:28,448 --> 00:10:31,448
and can try to understand
where it fits best.

211
00:10:31,448 --> 00:10:33,968
So this wheeling and dealing
should lead you

212
00:10:33,969 --> 00:10:36,503
to fully find attractive opportunities

213
00:10:36,504 --> 00:10:39,043
and what we call the "killer application"

214
00:10:39,044 --> 00:10:41,483
not in a negative sense,
it's in a positive sense.

215
00:10:41,484 --> 00:10:43,995
Because it should be the application

216
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:46,405
where you potentially can earn
most of the money.

217
00:10:46,406 --> 00:10:48,405
- It takes over the whole market.
- Exactly.

218
00:10:48,406 --> 00:10:51,593
Where you have the opportunity
to kill the competition. (laughing)

219
00:10:52,543 --> 00:10:55,629
So let's look at one,
this is carbon reinforced fiber,

220
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,800
it was also developed for NASA to
protect and house the satellites in space

221
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:02,804
with a slim material
that doesn't weigh a lot.

222
00:11:02,805 --> 00:11:06,057
This was developed in the '50s,
but it took 15 years

223
00:11:06,058 --> 00:11:07,958
until someone actually figured out

224
00:11:07,959 --> 00:11:11,804
that the "killer application"
would be sports equipment.

225
00:11:11,805 --> 00:11:15,681
Nowadays, it's used in all sorts
of sports equipment,

226
00:11:15,682 --> 00:11:17,267
but it just took so long.

227
00:11:17,268 --> 00:11:20,963
So if you think about this type of problem
that we're discussing right now,

228
00:11:21,955 --> 00:11:24,445
If you are really good
at identifying opportunities

229
00:11:24,446 --> 00:11:26,648
this has huge potential
for you in firm creation,

230
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:29,837
because it means you might be
the first one to identify

231
00:11:29,838 --> 00:11:33,668
these really cool applications
that will allow you to grow as a company.

232
00:11:33,669 --> 00:11:37,317
So in sum, when you think about it,
it has a two-fold importance

233
00:11:37,318 --> 00:11:40,060
for one, the market opportunity
provides you with the fertile ground

234
00:11:40,061 --> 00:11:41,664
on which to build your venture--

235
00:11:41,665 --> 00:11:46,299
- And it also shapes the identity
of your firm, who you are as a company,

236
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:49,683
how others see you,
how you see yourself,

237
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:51,791
so it's really one
of the most important decisions

238
00:11:51,792 --> 00:11:54,121
you're going to make as an entrepreneur.

239
00:11:54,122 --> 00:11:56,860
(Marc) So in order to identify
the "killer application",

240
00:11:56,861 --> 00:11:59,889
you want to see
which opportunities are out there.

241
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:01,677
This is not trivial.

242
00:12:01,678 --> 00:12:03,924
I think the interesting question is

243
00:12:03,925 --> 00:12:06,132
which opportunities
can't you see at first?

244
00:12:06,133 --> 00:12:07,902
What can you do in order to see

245
00:12:07,903 --> 00:12:10,540
more of that opportunity space
that is waiting for you?

246
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,609
And this will actually be
not today's topic--

247
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:16,965
...but the topic of the next segment
that Marc's going to walk you through.

248
00:12:16,966 --> 00:12:19,643
So this will be 2.2, and I see you then.
