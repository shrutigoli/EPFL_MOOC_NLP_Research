1
00:00:05,361 --> 00:00:06,580
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:09,783
We're going to talk in this segment 
about intellectual property.

3
00:00:10,487 --> 00:00:12,067
We're going to describe it, discuss it.

4
00:00:12,067 --> 00:00:13,915
We're going to figure out how 
it's different from

5
00:00:13,915 --> 00:00:18,182
other forms of property 
and why do governments around the world

6
00:00:18,182 --> 00:00:20,984
recognize it, use it, and find it useful

7
00:00:20,984 --> 00:00:24,158
for the people in their own
countries and jurisdictions.

8
00:00:24,765 --> 00:00:28,205
We're going to discus what it means 
when someone copies you

9
00:00:28,205 --> 00:00:30,480
and how you can prevent them
from copying you.

10
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:34,467
And then we'll talk through the details of
the different types of

11
00:00:34,467 --> 00:00:38,275
intellectual property, 
starting with trade secrets,

12
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:42,046
trademarks, patents, copyrights

13
00:00:42,046 --> 00:00:45,817
and then there are a bunch of other ones, 
which we're not going to get to today.

14
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:47,966
Two of which trade dress,

15
00:00:47,966 --> 00:00:51,548
which varies a lot from jurisdiction 
to jurisdiction.

16
00:00:53,078 --> 00:00:54,146
Design.

17
00:00:55,112 --> 00:01:01,027
It's an absolute mess 
from country to country.

18
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:05,870
It's actually very complicated-- 
you see we'll mention design in

19
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,519
maybe some of the other ones as well today

20
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:12,323
but we're not going to have time 
to go into lots of details about design.

21
00:01:12,784 --> 00:01:15,122
You may want to look that up 
for your own country

22
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:17,789
and see how design is handled 
and then there are a bunch of

23
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:20,345
other ones too, which we will not 
get into today.

24
00:01:20,345 --> 00:01:23,025
We'll talk about the four major types 
of intellectual property.

25
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,613
So let's get going.

26
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:27,684
So let's talk about real property 
versus personal property

27
00:01:27,684 --> 00:01:29,425
versus intellectual property.

28
00:01:30,192 --> 00:01:34,386
Real property is physical property

29
00:01:34,386 --> 00:01:36,814
that cannot be moved.

30
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:42,146
There's a whole set of law that's come 
to distinguish between property

31
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:44,908
that can't be moved and property 
that can be moved,

32
00:01:44,908 --> 00:01:46,672
which is personal property.

33
00:01:46,672 --> 00:01:51,145
So examples of real property: 
your house, your apartment,

34
00:01:51,145 --> 00:01:55,418
if you own some land-- transferring 
that land there's usually subject

35
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:59,049
to a bunch of rules and regulations,
possibly taxes

36
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:04,525
and there could be rules about 
you selling your land

37
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,448
to someone else and how they should buy, 
when they should be

38
00:02:07,448 --> 00:02:08,900
recorded some place, etc. etc.

39
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:12,451
So real property has it's 
own set of rules.

40
00:02:12,451 --> 00:02:16,317
Personal property are other tangible goods
that you own

41
00:02:16,317 --> 00:02:20,531
but that can be moved around: 
your clothes, your bicycle

42
00:02:20,531 --> 00:02:24,167
and other pieces of personal property

43
00:02:24,167 --> 00:02:28,039
that you have and of course we have rules 
and regulations about what to do

44
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,373
with personal property.

45
00:02:29,373 --> 00:02:32,744
You can't just take someone's clothes 
without their permission

46
00:02:32,744 --> 00:02:34,226
and start wearing them.

47
00:02:34,226 --> 00:02:35,857
You can't steal someone's bicycle.

48
00:02:35,857 --> 00:02:39,056
If you do you could end up 
getting in trouble with the law, etc.

49
00:02:39,056 --> 00:02:42,082
So personal property is 
also a tangible good.

50
00:02:42,082 --> 00:02:45,575
Now on the other hand, 
intellectual property is regarded as

51
00:02:45,575 --> 00:02:49,999
creative output or 
the product of the mind.

52
00:02:50,593 --> 00:02:57,679
So these are things like discoveries, 
inventions, literature, music,

53
00:02:58,313 --> 00:03:04,417
and over the centuries 
there has developed entire body of law

54
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:09,332
relating to how to create, 
transfer, sell, rent, etc.

55
00:03:09,332 --> 00:03:11,412
this particular type of property

56
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:12,954
and that's what we're going 
to talk about today.

57
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,823
Let's talk about why different countries

58
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:19,584
recognize intellectual property.

59
00:03:19,748 --> 00:03:22,536
Why do they setup these special rules 
for intellectual property?

60
00:03:22,747 --> 00:03:27,611
Most countries and different jurisdictions
have slightly different rules.

61
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:31,524
That's becoming less pronounced over time

62
00:03:31,524 --> 00:03:38,596
but still there are important differences 
across countries and they happen to

63
00:03:38,596 --> 00:03:41,858
correspond to the philosophy of

64
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:44,851
the purpose of intellectual property.

65
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:50,540
The purpose of intellectual property is 
to give people incentives

66
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:54,705
to make discoveries and creative outputs.

67
00:03:55,649 --> 00:04:01,277
So therefore depending on how you approach
the incentive to the inventor

68
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:05,435
or the creative type person versus 
the benefit to society

69
00:04:05,435 --> 00:04:09,542
might influence how you structure 
your systems of rules

70
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:13,861
and regulations and laws having to do 
with intellectual property.

71
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:16,544
Some people call the 
"national innovation system".

72
00:04:16,784 --> 00:04:19,305
How you structure your 
national innovation system

73
00:04:19,305 --> 00:04:22,121
depends on how you feel about 
these different things.

74
00:04:22,121 --> 00:04:26,061
There's usually some kind of rules 
about disclosure.

75
00:04:26,792 --> 00:04:33,640
There's the exclusivity and there is 
the term of the protection that you have.

76
00:04:33,977 --> 00:04:37,138
So disclosure is just how much information
you need to give out.

77
00:04:37,302 --> 00:04:44,227
Exclusivity is how much
you can keep this to yourself

78
00:04:44,384 --> 00:04:46,144
to prevent others from copying you

79
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:52,926
and the term is how much time 
you have exclusivity if you have it

80
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:56,695
and what most governments or states

81
00:04:56,695 --> 00:05:02,070
as we call them, would say that
there's a trade-off there,

82
00:05:02,212 --> 00:05:07,554
those three things define different 
aspects of how much you want

83
00:05:07,554 --> 00:05:10,699
to protect society versus how much 
you want to protect individual

84
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:12,931
in terms of the inventor.

85
00:05:13,084 --> 00:05:16,548
So very long terms, for example,
are generally considered

86
00:05:16,548 --> 00:05:20,553
to be really, really good for the inventor
or for the creative-type people

87
00:05:20,553 --> 00:05:25,339
because they can make money from 
their inventions or their discoveries.

88
00:05:26,921 --> 00:05:30,842
On the other hand, that's not so great 
for society because it takes a long time

89
00:05:30,842 --> 00:05:33,672
before you can start building on 
those prior inventions

90
00:05:33,803 --> 00:05:40,739
whereas very short terms of exclusivity 
leads to perhaps a benefit to society

91
00:05:40,739 --> 00:05:43,790
and some might argue but that might 
hurt your incentive

92
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:48,890
to make the investment in the first place 
to do the inventions.

93
00:05:49,391 --> 00:05:52,532
So this is the kind of things-- 
that's why in general

94
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:54,070
governments around the world

95
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,652
do acknowledge and recognize
intellectual property

96
00:05:57,652 --> 00:06:00,991
and have a whole system
of innovation to deal with it.

97
00:06:01,923 --> 00:06:05,384
Let's talk about preventing others 
from copying you.

98
00:06:05,384 --> 00:06:07,536
Also known as exclusivity.

99
00:06:07,536 --> 00:06:12,083
Generally speaking in most countries, 
if you are the owner

100
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:15,416
of intellectual property 
you can prevent others

101
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,724
from directly copying you.

102
00:06:18,085 --> 00:06:21,275
However, we have to remember 
that is it property

103
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:26,450
so it has the same kinds of rules, 
regulations that you would have

104
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:28,329
with other types of property as well.

105
00:06:28,329 --> 00:06:31,467
So you can sell your rights 
to your intellectual property.

106
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:33,005
If you invent something

107
00:06:33,609 --> 00:06:36,540
and you gain some 
intellectual property on it,

108
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:40,365
you could then write a contract 
to allow for its use by someone else

109
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:44,190
or you could even sell your rights 
to that invention to someone else.

110
00:06:44,488 --> 00:06:48,643
When you write a contract to allow 
someone to use your technology

111
00:06:48,643 --> 00:06:51,912
or your invention, we call that 
a "license agreement"

112
00:06:51,912 --> 00:06:54,187
but a license agreement is 
just a fancy term

113
00:06:54,187 --> 00:06:58,257
for a contract that happens to deal 
with intellectual property.

114
00:06:58,606 --> 00:07:03,112
Usually it involves what we call 
"technology transfer"

115
00:07:03,112 --> 00:07:07,793
or the right to use something 
against receiving money,

116
00:07:07,793 --> 00:07:10,086
which is also called the "royalty"

117
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:13,037
but there could be lots of other terms.

118
00:07:13,037 --> 00:07:16,534
Anything you can put in a contract, 
you can put into a license agreement

119
00:07:16,534 --> 00:07:19,743
so you might think of 
a very simple contract

120
00:07:19,743 --> 00:07:21,370
or license agreement

121
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:28,025
as "I give you money and you give me 
the right to use your technology."

122
00:07:29,334 --> 00:07:32,681
But on the other hand, you could also say,
"Well I give you money"

123
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:35,364
"and then you give me the right "
"to use your technology"

124
00:07:35,364 --> 00:07:38,085
"and then when I sell my product, "
"which is your product"

125
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:44,443
"is embedded in mine, then I'm going "
"to pay you 5% of my gross sales"

126
00:07:44,443 --> 00:07:48,436
"of my product as a royalty."

127
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:51,213
Okay and then you could have 
something even more complicated.

128
00:07:51,213 --> 00:07:56,217
You could say, "I'll give you some fixed 
amount of money,"

129
00:07:56,668 --> 00:07:59,869
"plus amount of money that's based on 
the price of oil on that day"

130
00:07:59,869 --> 00:08:03,770
"that we close the deal and then you let me
use your technology"

131
00:08:03,770 --> 00:08:07,521
"and then I give you a royalty 
which is based partially"

132
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:13,327
"on the percentage of gross sales 
and partially on some other"

133
00:08:13,327 --> 00:08:17,627
"fluctuating asset that happens 
to be valued on a certain day"

134
00:08:17,627 --> 00:08:19,226
"that I actually
transfer the money to you."

135
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:21,157
So there's lots of complications here.

136
00:08:21,157 --> 00:08:25,544
Just think of a license agreement 
as any kind of contract

137
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:32,017
that allows you to rent or allows 
someone to use your intellectual property

138
00:08:32,017 --> 00:08:36,601
and if they don't have it, then you can 
stop them from copying you.

139
00:08:37,167 --> 00:08:40,277
Okay, so let's walk through 
the four most popular

140
00:08:40,277 --> 00:08:44,969
types of intellectual property 
and define them, give some examples,

141
00:08:44,969 --> 00:08:48,929
and then talk about some of the pluses 
and minuses of each of these things.

142
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:51,228
First is trade secrets.

143
00:08:51,228 --> 00:08:56,072
Trade secrets is where you take value 
information related to your business

144
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,146
and you keep it a secret.

145
00:09:00,304 --> 00:09:02,794
You know that could be 
chemical formulation,

146
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:06,654
it could be a process for 
manufacturing something,

147
00:09:06,654 --> 00:09:10,418
it could be the source code for some 
software application that you've made.

148
00:09:10,575 --> 00:09:13,991
These are things that are, in general, 
not obvious to anyone

149
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:16,541
who sees your product 
or uses your service.

150
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:19,122
They don't know how you got there

151
00:09:19,122 --> 00:09:22,783
and so if you can keep that particular 
aspect of it secret,

152
00:09:22,783 --> 00:09:26,173
then you have some kind of 
competitive advantage.

153
00:09:26,173 --> 00:09:29,971
Now in terms of disclosure, 
not only can you not disclose

154
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:35,860
but you have to make active effort
at keeping it secret.

155
00:09:36,730 --> 00:09:39,842
That means that you have to tell 
any employees that you have,

156
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:41,502
that this is a secret.

157
00:09:41,502 --> 00:09:45,561
You can't tell anyone this 
under circumstances and

158
00:09:45,561 --> 00:09:51,532
some people go to great lengths
by not disclosing all parts of the "secret"

159
00:09:51,532 --> 00:09:55,623
so that no one person has access 
to the whole secret.

160
00:09:58,346 --> 00:10:03,546
In terms of the term, duration of this is 
as long as you can keep it a secret

161
00:10:03,927 --> 00:10:06,505
then you get the competitive advantage.

162
00:10:08,027 --> 00:10:13,505
In terms of exclusivity, 
you can sue people

163
00:10:13,505 --> 00:10:17,961
for stealing your trade secret 
or divulging your trade secret

164
00:10:17,961 --> 00:10:19,552
in some cases.

165
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:22,141
If you tell your employees that

166
00:10:22,141 --> 00:10:24,723
this is a secret and they're not allowed 
to tell anyone

167
00:10:24,723 --> 00:10:26,732
and then they turn around 
and tell someone

168
00:10:26,732 --> 00:10:29,891
and that person starts incorporating 
your secret into their products,

169
00:10:29,891 --> 00:10:34,851
then you can sue the employee 
for revealing the secret

170
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:38,664
and you may be able to sue the competitor

171
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:44,025
from gaining monetarily from a stolen secret.

172
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:46,247
So there is a certain aspect of it.

173
00:10:46,247 --> 00:10:50,053
On the other hand, if there's 
an inadvertent leak of information--

174
00:10:50,053 --> 00:10:54,009
you know, you have a secret formula 
and you write it down

175
00:10:54,009 --> 00:10:55,856
and you leave it on a train seat someplace

176
00:10:55,856 --> 00:10:58,224
and someone else picks it up 
and sees the secret formula,

177
00:10:58,224 --> 00:11:01,012
that is too bad for you.

178
00:11:01,012 --> 00:11:03,388
You just inadvertently 
revealed your secret

179
00:11:03,388 --> 00:11:07,942
and anyone could turn around 
and commercialize it at that point.

180
00:11:08,732 --> 00:11:14,241
This is the most important 
or let's just say the most popular type

181
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:15,697
of intellectual property.

182
00:11:15,697 --> 00:11:17,330
We've done lots of research on this,

183
00:11:17,372 --> 00:11:20,323
surveys from different companies, 
different industries,

184
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:23,556
and pretty much across the board

185
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:27,593
except for some small exceptions,

186
00:11:27,593 --> 00:11:33,136
trade secrecy is the most popular form 
of intellectual property.

187
00:11:34,123 --> 00:11:35,862
Alright let's talk about trademarks.

188
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,399
What are trademarks?

189
00:11:37,399 --> 00:11:41,341
Trademarks are symbols or words

190
00:11:41,341 --> 00:11:45,568
that are used to distinguish your company 
from other companies

191
00:11:45,568 --> 00:11:47,382
and to identify your business.

192
00:11:47,489 --> 00:11:49,650
It could be your brand name,

193
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:54,591
it could be some logo or design 
that represents your company

194
00:11:54,823 --> 00:11:59,332
or it could be some words that identify 
your product or service

195
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:05,034
and trademarks are used 
once they are put into use

196
00:12:05,034 --> 00:12:06,977
they must be used continuously.

197
00:12:07,171 --> 00:12:09,756
They can help identify 
the origin of the product

198
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:13,795
and they can reinforce your brand image.

199
00:12:14,396 --> 00:12:18,043
So what do you do with the trademark 
is when you start using it--

200
00:12:18,043 --> 00:12:21,364
and it should be sufficiently different 
from everyone else's--

201
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:24,772
then that identifies your company 
and you need to keep using it

202
00:12:24,772 --> 00:12:25,850
over and over again.

203
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,036
Different countries have 
different rules on this

204
00:12:28,036 --> 00:12:31,559
but in general you need to continuous use 
your trademark

205
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:35,780
and you cannot stop for 
any long period of time.

206
00:12:36,185 --> 00:12:39,979
So if you stop for more than 
two to five years,

207
00:12:39,979 --> 00:12:42,800
then you can lose your trademark.

208
00:12:44,482 --> 00:12:48,399
The one exception to that rule is 
you could actually be so phenomenally

209
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:51,562
popular with your trademark 
that it becomes so ubiquitous

210
00:12:51,562 --> 00:12:53,630
that everyone starts using it 
as a generic term

211
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:55,021
you can also lose your trademark.

212
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:56,281
So be careful on that too.

213
00:12:56,281 --> 00:13:00,604
You have to aggressively stop people 
from using your trademark

214
00:13:00,604 --> 00:13:03,716
to represent other products 
or competing products or services.

215
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:05,321
That's the exclusivity part.

216
00:13:05,321 --> 00:13:09,818
You're allowed to stop people 
from posing as you

217
00:13:09,818 --> 00:13:15,297
or putting confusion into the market 
by using similar symbols or words

218
00:13:15,297 --> 00:13:17,989
or even using the same symbol 
that you already used

219
00:13:17,989 --> 00:13:21,698
and you can stop them from 
commercializing products and services

220
00:13:21,698 --> 00:13:25,013
that are associated with 
that particular mark.

221
00:13:26,311 --> 00:13:30,387
Okay, let's talk about patents, 
also know as patents.

222
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:36,691
A patent is the right to exclude others 
from commercializing an invention,

223
00:13:36,691 --> 00:13:39,578
something that's given, usually by law

224
00:13:39,844 --> 00:13:44,887
and it could be a product innovation, 
it could be a process

225
00:13:44,887 --> 00:13:47,972
in some countries but not all,
it could be a method.

226
00:13:50,741 --> 00:13:52,347
How do you get a patent?

227
00:13:52,383 --> 00:13:57,599
You have to apply through whatever 
country you want the patent to hold in

228
00:13:57,754 --> 00:14:02,166
or whatever jurisdiction 
you want it to be enforced in

229
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:04,616
and you have to pass tests.

230
00:14:05,436 --> 00:14:08,388
Now not every country has 
exactly the same tests

231
00:14:08,388 --> 00:14:10,645
but most of them have

232
00:14:11,592 --> 00:14:17,694
requirements relating to the fact 
that the patent must be useful,

233
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:19,904
someone has to find it useful.

234
00:14:20,311 --> 00:14:22,085
It can't be obvious

235
00:14:23,278 --> 00:14:26,398
and it has to be novel or new.

236
00:14:26,398 --> 00:14:29,072
It can't be the same as what 
someone else already did

237
00:14:29,072 --> 00:14:31,365
or the something that was 
in the public domain already.

238
00:14:31,365 --> 00:14:33,206
It has to be something new.

239
00:14:33,206 --> 00:14:38,765
It can't be obvious what you did 
and someone must find it useful.

240
00:14:38,887 --> 00:14:41,003
If these conditions are met,

241
00:14:41,003 --> 00:14:45,848
then the patent office 
in whatever jurisdiction

242
00:14:45,848 --> 00:14:50,007
may accept your patent.

243
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:52,147
Then you'll be subject to some disclosure.

244
00:14:52,147 --> 00:14:55,617
Now disclosure rules also vary 
by jurisdiction.

245
00:14:57,009 --> 00:15:00,556
Sooner or later there's going to be 
full disclosure in the public domain.

246
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:05,528
In some countries there's disclosure 
at the point of granting the patent

247
00:15:05,528 --> 00:15:08,828
or within X months of granting the patent

248
00:15:08,828 --> 00:15:11,818
or within X months of applying 
for the patent.

249
00:15:11,818 --> 00:15:15,227
But in general, within a few years, 
let's just say,

250
00:15:15,227 --> 00:15:18,526
after you apply for you patent pretty 
much everyone is going

251
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:22,627
to know exactly what you did
and again to get back to that point about

252
00:15:22,627 --> 00:15:28,239
encouraging further invention, 
that's the whole idea.

253
00:15:28,911 --> 00:15:32,405
You are trading off disclosure 
for exclusivity.

254
00:15:32,405 --> 00:15:34,640
So you're going to give everyone 
what you did,

255
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:38,931
you're going to get it for usually 
15 to 20 years depending on the country

256
00:15:38,931 --> 00:15:41,092
and even within the same country

257
00:15:41,092 --> 00:15:44,907
there may be different types of patents 
that may have different terms

258
00:15:44,907 --> 00:15:48,269
but on the order of 15 to 20 years 
you're going to have exclusivity

259
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:53,505
and during that time you can stop others 
from producing or using the invention

260
00:15:53,505 --> 00:15:55,994
by suing them for patent-infringement.

261
00:15:57,196 --> 00:15:59,942
Just one note in terms of the start ups--

262
00:16:00,616 --> 00:16:02,178
how this relates to start ups.

263
00:16:02,178 --> 00:16:07,737
Sometimes investors do like to see 
intellectual property owned by start ups.

264
00:16:07,737 --> 00:16:10,767
It's not always the case 
but sometimes it can add

265
00:16:10,767 --> 00:16:15,308
to the strength of your arguments 
about competition

266
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,865
and how you're going to be successful 
in the market

267
00:16:17,865 --> 00:16:21,026
by saying that you do have some 
intellectual property,

268
00:16:21,026 --> 00:16:24,807
thus making it more difficult 
for competitors to copy you.

269
00:16:25,509 --> 00:16:27,625
Okay, let's move on to copyrights.

270
00:16:27,692 --> 00:16:34,127
Copyright is the right to copy, perform, 
or disseminate

271
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:38,890
the output of creative works.

272
00:16:39,754 --> 00:16:41,944
So what are some examples of copyrights?

273
00:16:41,944 --> 00:16:45,488
They could be useful for literature,

274
00:16:46,241 --> 00:16:50,406
for music, for some software--

275
00:16:50,406 --> 00:16:51,843
we won't get into 
the legal aspects of that

276
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,357
because that's super complicated--

277
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:57,293
some documentation, some designs.

278
00:16:58,386 --> 00:17:08,593
Basically it's the written instantiation
of some creative process.

279
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:14,547
Now one of the benefits of copyright 
is in most countries

280
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:16,237
copyright is automatic.

281
00:17:16,237 --> 00:17:21,432
As soon as you produce something, 
then you automatically

282
00:17:21,432 --> 00:17:24,569
are holding the copyright 
to that particular work

283
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:30,278
and that copyright is a relatively 
long, long term.

284
00:17:30,278 --> 00:17:32,089
So that's going to be

285
00:17:32,929 --> 00:17:38,136
the life of the creator or author plus, 
depending on the country,

286
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:40,978
usually between 50 to 70 years

287
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:45,286
after the death of the author.

288
00:17:46,203 --> 00:17:48,286
So what does that mean?

289
00:17:48,286 --> 00:17:54,066
That means that you can prevent 
someone from making a copy

290
00:17:54,066 --> 00:17:56,535
of that particular work.

291
00:17:56,535 --> 00:17:58,989
Now there are lots and lots of 
restrictions on this,

292
00:17:58,989 --> 00:18:02,231
in the sense that you can't 
copyright an idea,

293
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:06,406
you can only copyright 
the written form of the idea

294
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:11,197
and when we talk about the written form 
we mean the exact written form.

295
00:18:12,107 --> 00:18:15,404
So you cannot stop someone from 
modifying what you've written

296
00:18:15,404 --> 00:18:18,014
and writing something related 
to what you've written.

297
00:18:18,014 --> 00:18:23,299
In general, you can't stop someone from
making a parody of what you've written

298
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:29,615
but on the other hand, you can stop them 
from making a literal copy.

299
00:18:29,615 --> 00:18:31,818
For example, in the case of a book,

300
00:18:31,818 --> 00:18:35,833
if you wrote a book and I took your book
and went to a copy machine

301
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,238
and made 1,000 copies of your book 
then I went on the streets

302
00:18:38,238 --> 00:18:40,898
and started selling copies of your book
and making money from it,

303
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:46,159
then if you found out, you could actually 
stop me from doing that

304
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:50,035
and you could probably collect damages 
from me based on how much money I made

305
00:18:50,035 --> 00:18:54,211
and how much money you lost 
because of my actions.

306
00:18:57,819 --> 00:19:00,291
Copyrights are enforceable

307
00:19:00,839 --> 00:19:05,814
but it has to be more or less 
an exact copy.

308
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:10,961
Okay, here's a summary of 
the different types of intellectual property

309
00:19:10,961 --> 00:19:14,806
with some of the major advantages 
and disadvantages of each of them.

310
00:19:15,094 --> 00:19:17,207
Alright, let's just walk through them 
really quickly.

311
00:19:17,207 --> 00:19:20,561
A trade secret, again, 
the lack of disclosure

312
00:19:20,561 --> 00:19:24,346
means you keep it a secret, 
which can lead to competitive advantage

313
00:19:24,346 --> 00:19:26,540
for as long as you can keep it a secret

314
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,087
and as long as things 
in the market don't change

315
00:19:29,087 --> 00:19:31,479
that makes your secret irrelevant.

316
00:19:31,757 --> 00:19:36,243
A disadvantage is that if there's 
an inadvertent leak,

317
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:38,709
your secret is out, there is nothing 
you can do about it

318
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,291
once your secret it out there.

319
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:43,761
You may be able to stop someone 
from stealing your secret

320
00:19:43,761 --> 00:19:47,975
or using a stolen secret but any kind of 
inadvertent leak means

321
00:19:47,975 --> 00:19:53,117
your secret is out and someone is 
going to be commercializing it

322
00:19:53,117 --> 00:19:55,837
and that's your problem at that point.

323
00:19:56,586 --> 00:19:59,333
In terms of reverse engineering-- 
reverse engineering can happen

324
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,558
in lots of different places 
including in patents

325
00:20:02,558 --> 00:20:05,159
but if someone reverse engineers 
what you've done

326
00:20:05,159 --> 00:20:08,631
and you've kept it a secret then 
there's not much you can do

327
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:11,453
and in some extreme cases,

328
00:20:12,967 --> 00:20:16,310
someone could even conceivably 
get a patent on something

329
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,060
that you've kept a secret, 
you've never told anyone about

330
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:22,907
and then they may be able 
to even stop you

331
00:20:22,907 --> 00:20:26,786
if they could from using your own secret.

332
00:20:28,867 --> 00:20:30,626
In terms of a trademark,

333
00:20:31,989 --> 00:20:35,558
it definitely reduces confusion 
in the market.

334
00:20:35,558 --> 00:20:37,007
So that's a big advantage.

335
00:20:37,007 --> 00:20:41,266
It reduces the possibility of 
some competitor posing as you

336
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:44,866
or trying to sell things under your name 
or under your symbol, logo, etc.

337
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:50,595
Disadvantages: as we mentioned, 
if it's so popular--

338
00:20:50,787 --> 00:20:53,026
this is actually a fairly rare occurrence--

339
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:56,474
it could pass into the public domain 
if it becomes generic.

340
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:59,527
Also if you stop using it 
for some period of time,

341
00:20:59,527 --> 00:21:01,677
generally speaking within 
two to five years,

342
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:07,440
it could also pass in public domain 
therefore you would no longer

343
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,938
be the holder of the trademark.

344
00:21:10,686 --> 00:21:14,966
In terms of patents, the advantages here 
you do gain exclusivity

345
00:21:14,966 --> 00:21:21,067
for a relatively long period 
and if the patent is accepted

346
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:22,999
in whatever jurisdiction 
you've applied for

347
00:21:22,999 --> 00:21:26,539
and it's granted, then most places 
in the world

348
00:21:26,539 --> 00:21:32,209
do recognize patents and you will have 
some exclusivity in whatever jurisdiction

349
00:21:32,209 --> 00:21:37,080
you get your patent accepted.

350
00:21:38,527 --> 00:21:42,017
Disadvantage: you are given 
full disclosure

351
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,777
and that leads to knowledge spill overs.

352
00:21:44,777 --> 00:21:48,200
In other words, people learn what 
you're doing based on your disclosure.

353
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:49,727
They can make something similar.

354
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:52,304
They may be able to invent something 
around what you're doing

355
00:21:52,304 --> 00:21:54,470
and so you are tipping them off
in some ways.

356
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:57,087
The costs are non-negligible.

357
00:21:57,087 --> 00:22:00,268
The cost of getting a patent itself 
is not that high

358
00:22:00,268 --> 00:22:05,662
but enforcement of patents is 
very, very expensive,

359
00:22:05,662 --> 00:22:09,009
not just in monetary terms, 
although it could be that, too.

360
00:22:09,009 --> 00:22:12,725
If you are being infringed on 
and you sue another company

361
00:22:12,725 --> 00:22:14,980
or if you are sued for infringement,

362
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:17,939
you're going to find it's very, very 
expensive legally

363
00:22:17,939 --> 00:22:23,373
plus it's going to suck up the time of 
your founders and of your executives,

364
00:22:23,373 --> 00:22:28,773
people working in your company, etc.
just to simply litigate the patent

365
00:22:29,249 --> 00:22:31,972
and so when we say 
"dedicating many resources"

366
00:22:31,972 --> 00:22:36,674
it's a disadvantage because you have to
have a certain amount of resources

367
00:22:36,674 --> 00:22:40,968
just to be able to pursue patenting 
and then to enforce it

368
00:22:40,968 --> 00:22:42,568
you need to have even more.

369
00:22:42,568 --> 00:22:45,518
So that's going to take a lot of 
time and money.

370
00:22:46,297 --> 00:22:48,517
We'll talk about copyrights finally.

371
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:52,276
Low cost, happens automatically,

372
00:22:52,828 --> 00:22:56,891
no formal registration necessary although 
certain countries do allow registration

373
00:22:56,891 --> 00:23:00,550
of copyrights as they do trademarks.

374
00:23:00,808 --> 00:23:05,808
The disadvantages are that you have 
to remember what is being protected:

375
00:23:05,808 --> 00:23:11,505
it's the embodiment of your idea 
that you produced already.

376
00:23:11,505 --> 00:23:13,507
It's not the idea itself.

377
00:23:13,507 --> 00:23:15,211
Ideas are not protected.

378
00:23:15,211 --> 00:23:18,539
You cannot stop someone from modifying it,
rewriting what you did,

379
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,062
you can't stop people 
from parody-ing you--

380
00:23:21,062 --> 00:23:25,277
which should be relatively 
rare event, I guess--

381
00:23:25,277 --> 00:23:29,081
and your cost for enforcement, again here,
are relatively high.

382
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:31,521
If you need to go after someone in court,

383
00:23:31,521 --> 00:23:34,748
you can end up spending a lot of money

384
00:23:34,748 --> 00:23:37,610
and again top management founder time

385
00:23:37,610 --> 00:23:42,827
is very valuable and if they're 
sitting in court all day

386
00:23:42,827 --> 00:23:45,770
it's, generally speaking, 
not a great thing.

387
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,870
So there you go that's a summary of

388
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:49,847
different types of intellectual property.

389
00:23:49,847 --> 00:23:52,099
What's the purpose of 
intellectual property

390
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:56,342
and now we're going to use that 
to think about appropriatablilty

391
00:23:56,342 --> 00:23:59,730
and making money from your innovations.

392
00:24:00,026 --> 00:24:01,520
See you next time.
