1
00:00:03,718 --> 00:00:05,832
Welcome back to week three 
Entrepreneurial Marketing.

2
00:00:05,832 --> 00:00:08,086
Today we are going to talk 
about crowdfunding.

3
00:00:08,086 --> 00:00:11,773
And crowdfunding you might say 
is more of a financial tool

4
00:00:11,773 --> 00:00:15,439
to raise funds but in fact it's also 
an important marketing channel

5
00:00:15,439 --> 00:00:16,501
for your venture.

6
00:00:16,501 --> 00:00:18,299
We'll do this one together today.

7
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:20,957
We're going to do this one together 
but next you're going to talk about--

8
00:00:20,957 --> 00:00:24,335
I'll talk about the financial aspects 
of crowdfunding.

9
00:00:24,335 --> 00:00:29,191
So what we want to introduce to you 
is in a way the mechanics of crowdfunding

10
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:31,114
from a marketing perspective today.

11
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,781
Highlight to you some examples 
that were pretty successful

12
00:00:34,781 --> 00:00:38,340
using the marketing side of crowdfunding
and going to show you

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:40,179
these possibilities in more detail.

14
00:00:40,179 --> 00:00:43,495
Let's look at this crowdfunding 
more systematically.

15
00:00:43,825 --> 00:00:46,905
(Chris) So there's the 
crowdfunding platform

16
00:00:48,955 --> 00:00:52,528
and that's usually some kind of 
internet platform

17
00:00:53,451 --> 00:00:57,370
that the entrepreneur uses 
to reach the crowd.

18
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:58,998
And who is the crowd?

19
00:00:58,998 --> 00:01:01,388
We'll talk a little bit about 
the composition of the crowd

20
00:01:01,388 --> 00:01:04,629
but think of the crowd as 
being the general public.

21
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:06,690
It could be anybody.

22
00:01:06,927 --> 00:01:09,389
It does not have to be 
a financial, professional--

23
00:01:09,389 --> 00:01:11,728
(Mark) Whoever visits 
the crowdfunding platform.

24
00:01:11,728 --> 00:01:14,438
The target segments that 
you might want to address

25
00:01:14,438 --> 00:01:17,202
is part of this crowd hopefully

26
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:20,149
but it's not necessarily 
only your targets that reach you.

27
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:23,182
(Chris) Right and then the entrepreneur 
is going to communicate

28
00:01:23,182 --> 00:01:28,254
to the crowd the information 
about the project.

29
00:01:28,254 --> 00:01:31,675
So they're going to give specific details 
about what they're working on

30
00:01:31,675 --> 00:01:32,898
and what they want to do.

31
00:01:32,898 --> 00:01:36,149
Plus may offer some rewards.

32
00:01:36,149 --> 00:01:40,613
The rewards are going to be access 
to the first prototype,

33
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:44,305
beta-tester, lunch with the founder--

34
00:01:44,305 --> 00:01:46,015
(Mark) Which could be fun!

35
00:01:46,015 --> 00:01:47,715
(Chris) It could be a lot of fun.

36
00:01:48,226 --> 00:01:49,768
Or any other sort of rewards.

37
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:52,339
(Mark) Exactly and then we have 
some examples later on

38
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:55,292
that give you some orientation
of what these rewards could be.

39
00:01:55,292 --> 00:01:59,566
In return, the entrepreneur hopefully 
gets some seed funding

40
00:01:59,566 --> 00:02:04,933
that will be next week's conversation 
with Chris about the financial aspects.

41
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:09,266
Important non-financial resources 
like getting access to customers,

42
00:02:09,266 --> 00:02:11,137
getting the attention of the customers,

43
00:02:11,137 --> 00:02:14,092
getting the product off the ground 
and these are important

44
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:18,002
non-financial resources that are vital 
to the new venture creation process

45
00:02:18,002 --> 00:02:19,906
because you need customers ultimately.

46
00:02:19,906 --> 00:02:23,830
We talked about this a couple of times 
during this week's segment already.

47
00:02:23,830 --> 00:02:27,271
So let's look at how crowdfunding works 
in much more detail.

48
00:02:28,049 --> 00:02:29,681
So let's talk about

49
00:02:30,192 --> 00:02:34,271
the non-financial aspects 
of crowdfunding platforms.

50
00:02:34,271 --> 00:02:36,972
As we mentioned, it's a new channel

51
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,305
for raising money and marketing, 
testing, validating your idea.

52
00:02:43,605 --> 00:02:48,213
So the first thing of course is 
it's a way of getting your ideas out there

53
00:02:48,213 --> 00:02:53,233
and to see how people interact with you:
investor behavior.

54
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:58,311
The investors, again, are the people 
who are backing the venture

55
00:02:59,051 --> 00:03:01,614
and it helps you build 
a list of those backers.

56
00:03:01,614 --> 00:03:05,012
It also allows you to build 
some relationships with them,

57
00:03:05,012 --> 00:03:09,217
discover, engage, interact with 
these new customers

58
00:03:09,217 --> 00:03:12,505
and build some brand recognition.

59
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:16,349
Allows you to do a follow up 
after a soft-launch.

60
00:03:16,349 --> 00:03:19,485
A soft-launch might be sort of 
a pre-release into the market

61
00:03:19,485 --> 00:03:21,956
that you use only with your backers

62
00:03:21,956 --> 00:03:24,621
and then they will then turn around 
and spread the word

63
00:03:24,621 --> 00:03:30,125
or it could be used to get growth 
at the very beginning

64
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:33,286
to offer discounts on the new products,

65
00:03:33,286 --> 00:03:35,945
on the current products to get access 
to the prototypes

66
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:39,817
and therefore allowing you to reach 
a much bigger market.

67
00:03:40,433 --> 00:03:44,451
(Mark) Let's give you some more intuition
of what this could do to your venture

68
00:03:44,451 --> 00:03:48,565
and there are two very nice examples 
that we think are quite instructive.

69
00:03:48,565 --> 00:03:51,869
(Chris) We have some links for these 
two videos you can watch.

70
00:03:51,869 --> 00:03:54,760
(Mark) Exactly, so you just press on them 
and look at them.

71
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,738
It's three minutes each 
but it's quite instructive

72
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:02,348
because they are wonderful examples 
and two terrific examples

73
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:05,791
that tell you the whole range of 
possibilities there

74
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,918
that can be achieved by crowdfunding.

75
00:04:07,918 --> 00:04:09,870
So "Meow Parlour" in New York City,

76
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:12,714
it's actually a hybrid sort of idea, 
I would say.

77
00:04:12,714 --> 00:04:17,161
These guys have set up a parlour 
where there are homeless cats

78
00:04:17,161 --> 00:04:20,305
and you can go there and you can 
pet the cat, adopt the cat,

79
00:04:20,305 --> 00:04:23,896
and you can have coffee 
and then some pastries next to it.

80
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:26,925
(Chris) I think they may even feed the cat
some of the--

81
00:04:26,925 --> 00:04:29,503
I'm not really sure how that works.

82
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,925
(Mark) This cat is not fat.
It is not Garfield yet.

83
00:04:31,925 --> 00:04:33,450
(both laugh)

84
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:36,438
And then there is another example 
more of the high-tech arena,

85
00:04:36,438 --> 00:04:39,456
it's the Pebble Watch 
and it's a new watch.

86
00:04:39,456 --> 00:04:44,089
It's an e-paper watch and these guys 
have decided that it communicates

87
00:04:44,089 --> 00:04:47,457
with the iPhone or with 
the Android device,

88
00:04:47,457 --> 00:04:51,191
exactly and you can even 
design it yourself, etc. etc.

89
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,624
So they wanted to raise $100,000 
and how much did they get?

90
00:04:54,624 --> 00:04:56,065
(Chris) Over $10 million.

91
00:04:56,065 --> 00:04:59,827
I think this was supposed 
to be the first smart watch

92
00:04:59,827 --> 00:05:02,367
that was available cross platform.

93
00:05:02,367 --> 00:05:05,098
(Mark) That was 2012.

94
00:05:05,098 --> 00:05:07,963
The major effect that just bringing them 
on the market this year.

95
00:05:07,963 --> 00:05:09,404
So 2015.

96
00:05:09,404 --> 00:05:13,578
In that sense, I think these two examples 
show the range of projects

97
00:05:13,578 --> 00:05:15,985
that you will find on 
a crowdfunding platform.

98
00:05:15,985 --> 00:05:20,201
And let's look at those range of products 
next in more detail.

99
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:24,480
(Chris) This is a graphic of the kinds of 
players you have

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,109
and what we wanted to say here was

101
00:05:26,109 --> 00:05:28,169
the roles are constantly changing here.

102
00:05:28,169 --> 00:05:32,929
I mean we have entrepreneurs, 
people founding and running businesses.

103
00:05:32,929 --> 00:05:37,351
We have makers, people who are 
using 3D printing

104
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:39,669
and other kind of do-it-yourself people--

105
00:05:39,669 --> 00:05:42,655
(Mark) Maybe even carpenters, 
you know, lots of hobbyists.

106
00:05:42,655 --> 00:05:48,341
(Chris) Artists who are basically similar 
to makers but maybe on the more

107
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:50,752
creative arts side, fine arts.

108
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:53,585
Then we have fans, which could be fans 
of any of the above

109
00:05:53,585 --> 00:05:56,232
or could be fans of crowdfunding 
because there are people out there

110
00:05:56,232 --> 00:05:57,485
who just like crowdfunding.

111
00:05:57,485 --> 00:05:59,805
They like to participate 
in different projects.

112
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:02,762
(Mark) They are entertained by looking 
at all these proposals

113
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:05,525
and saying, "Okay, I particularly 
like this proposal here

114
00:06:05,525 --> 00:06:08,764
and I can invest in that proposal 
and see how it develops over time."

115
00:06:08,764 --> 00:06:12,476
So it's an exciting way of actually 
engaging in the creation of something new

116
00:06:12,476 --> 00:06:14,825
in a way that's a different 
form of entrepreneurship

117
00:06:14,825 --> 00:06:15,888
you could even say.

118
00:06:15,888 --> 00:06:19,704
So if you look at all these players, 
these could be potential backers,

119
00:06:19,704 --> 00:06:21,094
funders of your venture.

120
00:06:21,094 --> 00:06:22,365
(Chris) Right and they also switch around.

121
00:06:22,365 --> 00:06:26,317
So someone may be an entrepreneur 
seeking funding at one moment

122
00:06:26,317 --> 00:06:29,214
and then that same entrepreneur 
may actually be backing someone else.

123
00:06:29,214 --> 00:06:34,646
So I think it's kind of a fluid crowd 
and of course you have

124
00:06:34,646 --> 00:06:38,504
members of the general public too
and your friends on social media, etc.

125
00:06:38,504 --> 00:06:42,591
So there's all kinds of possibilities 
of people who participate in the crowd.

126
00:06:42,591 --> 00:06:44,607
(Mark) So in that sense when 
you're an entrepreneur

127
00:06:44,607 --> 00:06:46,688
and designing your own 
crowdfunding campaign,

128
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:49,323
you have to keep in mind 
that you are actually competing

129
00:06:49,323 --> 00:06:53,543
with other folks out there that 
might not have an entrepreneurial endeavor

130
00:06:53,543 --> 00:06:59,187
like you have but they just want to have 
an artistic proposition to the public

131
00:06:59,187 --> 00:07:01,119
or maybe they want to create something 
for the public.

132
00:07:01,119 --> 00:07:04,487
So in that sense, you are in a very 
heterogeneous mix of people

133
00:07:04,487 --> 00:07:06,622
who try to get the attention 
from the crowd.

134
00:07:06,622 --> 00:07:10,391
So keep that in mind as well as 
you're designing a crowdfunding campaign.

135
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:13,369
(Chris) We'll talk more 
about the mechanics

136
00:07:13,369 --> 00:07:17,777
in this particular module 
and then again next week

137
00:07:17,777 --> 00:07:19,491
we'll talk more about the finance.

138
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:20,004
(Mark) Exactly.

139
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:22,352
So we strongly advice you to look 
at lots and lots of examples

140
00:07:22,352 --> 00:07:24,024
on the crowdfunding platforms

141
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:27,583
because you learn in a fun way 
how this works

142
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,978
but you also learn by intuition 
of how this works.

143
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:34,555
What you see when you watch 
the Meow Parlour video is that

144
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:41,150
these guys underestimated the time it 
takes to get the funds into the company.

145
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:45,894
It took them two months and they wanted
to open their store within that time frame.

146
00:07:45,894 --> 00:07:48,953
So what it means:
it could take a lot of time.

147
00:07:48,953 --> 00:07:50,876
So you should budget appropriately.

148
00:07:52,615 --> 00:07:55,372
Also be prepared and have 
a plan of what to expect

149
00:07:55,372 --> 00:07:58,817
and I think by looking at many 
other crowdfunding campaigns

150
00:07:58,817 --> 00:08:01,634
you can get an intuitive feeling of 
what it actually means to be prepared

151
00:08:01,634 --> 00:08:06,114
because there's a [inaudible] of different
levels of preparedness in that sense.

152
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:10,463
Some crowdfunding campaigns 
are extremely professionally prepared

153
00:08:10,463 --> 00:08:14,948
while other are not so prepared 
and we have in the accompanying material

154
00:08:14,948 --> 00:08:19,028
to this [movie] some links to some 
very good crowdfunding campaigns

155
00:08:19,028 --> 00:08:23,044
so you can get ahead start on seeing what
a professional crowdfunding campaign is

156
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:25,872
and what might not be such 
a professional campaign.

157
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:28,402
Also be realistic in your rewards.

158
00:08:28,402 --> 00:08:31,100
Remember that the watch 
that we just showed you

159
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:34,928
they needed $100,000 
but they got $10 million,

160
00:08:34,928 --> 00:08:37,529
which is a wonderful surprise 
to the upside

161
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:40,037
but they were quite realistic in 
what they needed for that stage

162
00:08:40,037 --> 00:08:42,289
of company development, 
which was $100,000.

163
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:47,879
So don't over-exaggerate, 
don't push the cart too much in that sense

164
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:51,028
because you want to have people 
looking at your video and say,

165
00:08:51,028 --> 00:08:54,945
"Wow I trust these people. 
They have realistic assumptions."

166
00:08:54,945 --> 00:08:59,507
If you aren't realistic, you won't get the
trust and you will not get the support.

167
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:02,300
And what we've also seen is that 
it works best for teams.

168
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:06,861
There should be an engagement of people, 
other people want to--

169
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:10,081
the crowd wants to see that 
you're working together well as a team,

170
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:13,713
that you have a vision, a passion
for what you're actually doing.

171
00:09:13,713 --> 00:09:16,499
So from a marketing perspective, 
the crowdfunding campaign

172
00:09:16,499 --> 00:09:20,637
that you're going to develop 
also in this [movie] we'll help you along

173
00:09:20,637 --> 00:09:23,105
with strategic aspects 
and implementation issues

174
00:09:23,105 --> 00:09:24,855
that we discussed the other week.

175
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:27,583
So when you remember the 
positioning segmentation,

176
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,700
I think these types of decisions 
should be made

177
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,657
before you engage in 
a crowdfunding campaign

178
00:09:31,657 --> 00:09:35,906
because you want to understand 
where you are along the lines of

179
00:09:35,906 --> 00:09:40,219
how your customers should perceive you,
how you want to position yourself

180
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:44,103
with the other companies and this should 
already be your message

181
00:09:44,103 --> 00:09:46,174
that you send out to the crowd,

182
00:09:46,174 --> 00:09:49,803
to the public and that's similarly 
segmentation issues are relevant

183
00:09:49,803 --> 00:09:54,902
in this domain because you cannot fulfill
any type of wish to anyone out there.

184
00:09:54,902 --> 00:09:57,978
You won't have your segment because 
if you want to be everything to everyone

185
00:09:57,978 --> 00:09:59,742
you're no one to no one.

186
00:09:59,742 --> 00:10:00,676
(both laugh)

187
00:10:00,676 --> 00:10:02,601
Nothing to no one.

188
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:05,009
For instance, just to make 
this more intuitive

189
00:10:05,009 --> 00:10:09,415
it's the brand that you're going to portray 
to the outside world.

190
00:10:09,415 --> 00:10:12,177
It's not only your product 
but it's your company's brand.

191
00:10:12,177 --> 00:10:14,716
And then if you come more 
to the implimentation issues,

192
00:10:14,716 --> 00:10:16,831
there are issues regarding 
your distribution

193
00:10:16,831 --> 00:10:18,661
that you need to think of carefully.

194
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:21,372
There are issues regarding 
the promotional material

195
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:25,310
and your products, which promotional 
materials are oftentimes

196
00:10:25,310 --> 00:10:26,945
tied to the rewards.

197
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:30,034
It's about the pricing and then actually 
the crowdfunding platform

198
00:10:30,034 --> 00:10:33,408
allows you to experiment 
with a number of options.

199
00:10:33,408 --> 00:10:36,780
You can, for instance, set your product 
at different price levels--

200
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,833
Different rewards.

201
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:40,957
Some more luxurious version 
of the product.

202
00:10:40,957 --> 00:10:44,518
Just see how the crowd reacts 
and what they prefer and who prefers what.

203
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:48,734
In a way, profiling the crowd and trying 
to understand what they prefer

204
00:10:48,734 --> 00:10:52,390
in terms of your products 
and then you can try to engage in

205
00:10:52,390 --> 00:10:53,993
very thorough customer involvement.

206
00:10:53,993 --> 00:10:56,157
And one of the examples 
that we have seen before,

207
00:10:56,157 --> 00:11:00,066
they're emphasizing how they were 
working together with customers

208
00:11:00,066 --> 00:11:03,318
and learning about their venture 
and also retaining

209
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:05,305
those customers over time.

210
00:11:05,305 --> 00:11:08,490
So in that sense, there's a lot of 
marketing elements

211
00:11:08,490 --> 00:11:11,234
that are highly relevant in 
the crowdfunding campaign.

212
00:11:11,234 --> 00:11:15,677
So don't just embark, dive into 
your crowdfunding campaign just as this

213
00:11:15,677 --> 00:11:16,932
but think about it.

214
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:21,369
Make a strategic plan and in the examples 
we have provided online for you.

215
00:11:21,369 --> 00:11:23,967
They give you some good intuition
of what a professional

216
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,059
crowdfunding campaign should be.

217
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:30,618
So what we're going to do is we're going 
to give you the opportunity in this course

218
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:35,251
to set up and run your own 
crowdfunding campaign.

219
00:11:35,323 --> 00:11:37,272
I think that's a wonderful opportunity--

220
00:11:37,272 --> 00:11:40,441
It's a great opportunity and you're going 
to be able to raise real money

221
00:11:40,441 --> 00:11:45,017
and then depending on how it works 
with the grading at the end

222
00:11:45,017 --> 00:11:50,703
we are going to choose some projects 
to give even more prize money to

223
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:52,851
that will help boost your business 
at the very beginning.

224
00:11:52,851 --> 00:11:55,262
So we're going to have some 
different aspects of that.

225
00:11:55,262 --> 00:11:57,738
The next few days 
we're going to talk about--

226
00:11:57,738 --> 00:11:59,854
We keep the suspense up.

227
00:11:59,854 --> 00:12:01,750
Next week you're going to get the details.

228
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,646
You'll hear about the financing details 
and this week at some point

229
00:12:04,646 --> 00:12:07,370
we're going to also give you a segment 
on the mechanics

230
00:12:07,370 --> 00:12:10,779
of the crowdfunding platform 
that we're using for the project

231
00:12:10,779 --> 00:12:12,222
for this particular course.

232
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:13,019
Exactly.

233
00:12:13,019 --> 00:12:17,179
This is a great opportunity here for you 
to raise money for your own business.

234
00:12:17,239 --> 00:12:19,278
So start thinking about it now, 
as Mark just said,

235
00:12:19,278 --> 00:12:21,504
start thinking about it now 
with these various details

236
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:24,650
because those are going to become useful 
when you actually

237
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:27,580
run your crowdfunding campaign 
during this course.

238
00:12:27,901 --> 00:12:31,056
Good luck and we'll see you then 
in this other segment.

239
00:12:31,056 --> 00:12:32,915
When we'll talk more
about the financial aspect.

240
00:12:32,915 --> 00:12:33,784
Perfect.
