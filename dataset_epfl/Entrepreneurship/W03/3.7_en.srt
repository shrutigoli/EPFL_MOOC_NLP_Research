1
00:00:08,534 --> 00:00:11,626
So welcome back, this is
already the final segment of this week.

2
00:00:11,626 --> 00:00:13,394
Congratulations for making it so far!

3
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:15,859
This week was
on entrepreneurial marketing.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:20,217
The customer as well as the competition
were central stage during this week

5
00:00:20,218 --> 00:00:23,797
because you need to understand
both of these key players out there

6
00:00:23,798 --> 00:00:25,701
in order to make your sales.

7
00:00:25,702 --> 00:00:28,275
And I want you to remember
one important quote

8
00:00:28,276 --> 00:00:30,632
that we have discussed
this week in particular,

9
00:00:30,633 --> 00:00:32,750
and it's the quote
by Peter Drucker who said:

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,189
"The purpose of a business
is to create a customer,"

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:37,619
not another product or technology.

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:40,376
So, let's revisit
what we discussed this week.

13
00:00:40,377 --> 00:00:42,353
Beyond that quote, I want you to remember

14
00:00:42,354 --> 00:00:45,474
a key framework that we discussed
right at the beginning

15
00:00:45,475 --> 00:00:47,891
and that we walked through
during this week.

16
00:00:47,892 --> 00:00:50,277
It's this framework that shows you

17
00:00:50,278 --> 00:00:54,402
how entrepreneurial marketing
can be structured in your head.

18
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:56,597
There are some fundamental issues

19
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:58,878
that you need to understand
about your business,

20
00:00:58,878 --> 00:01:01,677
which is your company's
distinctive competence,

21
00:01:01,677 --> 00:01:04,408
your competitive advantage

22
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:07,701
that you may achieve
based on your competence,

23
00:01:07,702 --> 00:01:10,295
and then it's important to know

24
00:01:10,296 --> 00:01:13,557
that there are some strategic decisions
in entrepreneurial marketing,

25
00:01:13,557 --> 00:01:16,259
some operational 
implementation decisions

26
00:01:16,259 --> 00:01:17,469
that you have to take.

27
00:01:17,469 --> 00:01:20,488
And this distinction is
quite important, as we discussed,

28
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:25,199
because segmentation and positioning
are fundamental decisions

29
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,655
that will then shape and affect
the other types of decisions

30
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,851
that you are going to engage in.

31
00:01:31,852 --> 00:01:34,851
For instance, we've got
product/service development,

32
00:01:34,852 --> 00:01:36,911
naming the company, your pricing,

33
00:01:36,918 --> 00:01:39,579
distribution, sales force, promotion,

34
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,131
public relations, and advertising.

35
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:45,194
Let me briefly walk you through
each of these elements --

36
00:01:45,195 --> 00:01:49,879
especially the strategic decisions,
and implementation decisions

37
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,535
and options -- 
in a few slides.

38
00:01:51,536 --> 00:01:54,868
These strategic decisions relate,
as I've just mentioned,

39
00:01:54,868 --> 00:01:57,035
to segmentation and positioning,

40
00:01:57,035 --> 00:01:59,917
"Which is (are) my target market(s)?"

41
00:01:59,918 --> 00:02:02,782
Typically, entrepreneurs have 
one particular target market.

42
00:02:02,782 --> 00:02:06,299
And the positioning question is:
"Why will someone in the target market(s)

43
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:09,297
buy my product or service
instead of the competition's?"

44
00:02:09,298 --> 00:02:16,114
So it's how should I be perceived by
my customers vis-à-vis competing products.

45
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:17,917
Typically, as it's pointed out here,

46
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:20,092
these decisions are made jointly,

47
00:02:20,093 --> 00:02:22,854
because you might think
about your target segment

48
00:02:22,855 --> 00:02:27,249
and then come to the conclusion: "Well,
the positioning that I want to achieve

49
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:30,136
doesn't fit this target segment,"
or vice versa,

50
00:02:30,136 --> 00:02:34,029
so this is really a joint decision,
and you might go a bit back and forth

51
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:36,569
until you really understand
your target market

52
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,984
and how the people, the customers,
and the target market will perceive you

53
00:02:41,985 --> 00:02:43,735
vis-à-vis the competition.

54
00:02:43,736 --> 00:02:46,704
Core to understanding segmentation
and positioning

55
00:02:46,705 --> 00:02:49,677
is an understanding 
of your customers and of your competitors.

56
00:02:49,677 --> 00:02:52,128
And starting with the customer's side

57
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,951
you'll remember we discussed the benefits

58
00:02:54,952 --> 00:02:59,241
that your product is able to render
to customers, to give to customers,

59
00:02:59,242 --> 00:03:03,239
because the customers don't buy
the features, they buy the benefits.

60
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,948
And this is particularly important
in a technology context

61
00:03:05,948 --> 00:03:09,928
where many people are tempted to say,
"This product has wonderful features."

62
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:12,873
The customer looks at the product
from the perspective of saying,

63
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:14,979
"Well, what does this product do to me?

64
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:17,771
What type of job
does this product fulfill for me?"

65
00:03:17,772 --> 00:03:21,968
In terms of understanding your customers
there are two key features,

66
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:26,147
two key elements that are vital
to creating a successful firm.

67
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:29,813
One is, of course, understanding
your customers for making sales.

68
00:03:29,814 --> 00:03:33,102
This has to do with understanding
customer needs

69
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:35,300
and we talked about this at great length.

70
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:38,061
The second element,
which is equally important

71
00:03:38,062 --> 00:03:41,238
because you want to create
a successful venture that creates value,

72
00:03:41,238 --> 00:03:44,041
is to understand customers
from a value-creation perspective

73
00:03:44,041 --> 00:03:47,099
because not all customers create
the same type of value for you.

74
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,599
Understanding which customer segments
might be more valuable for your company

75
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,467
will help you to allocate
your time properly,

76
00:03:55,468 --> 00:03:58,891
and especially
your resources and attention.

77
00:03:58,892 --> 00:04:01,359
In terms of understanding 
your competition,

78
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:05,777
there are two key questions that we put
to the forefront of our discussions:

79
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,879
one was, "Who are your competitors?"

80
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,931
and two was, "What would we need
to know about these competitors?"

81
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:15,016
Oftentimes, and that's also
what we discussed,

82
00:04:15,017 --> 00:04:18,693
entrepreneurs have this hunch of saying,
"Well, we've produced an innovation,

83
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:21,915
and because we have that innovation
we do not have any competition."

84
00:04:21,915 --> 00:04:23,751
But that's oftentimes an indication

85
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:28,637
that entrepreneur doesn't really
understand his competition well,

86
00:04:28,638 --> 00:04:30,053
and also not his customers,

87
00:04:30,054 --> 00:04:34,188
because customers typically make a choice
what to spend the money on.

88
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:38,625
So there is competition at least
for the money in their pocket.

89
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:42,569
The intended outcomes
of this type of analysis are manifold,

90
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:44,540
and just to repeat a couple of those:

91
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:48,122
first of all, you want to make
your products stand out.

92
00:04:48,123 --> 00:04:49,852
You want to position,

93
00:04:49,853 --> 00:04:52,392
understand how to position your company.

94
00:04:52,392 --> 00:04:54,673
You also want to set
your prices competitively

95
00:04:54,674 --> 00:04:58,401
and assess any threats of competing firms.

96
00:04:58,402 --> 00:05:01,829
Ultimately, it also helps
if you understand your competition well,

97
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,088
it helps you to be realistic on how
successful you can be with your company.

98
00:05:06,089 --> 00:05:12,039
And this helps you to judge resource
requirements, the sales targets, etc.

99
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,835
So, when you've collected
all of these insights

100
00:05:14,836 --> 00:05:19,024
you have all the ingredients in place
to develop a compelling value proposition.

101
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:22,254
And we discussed the features
of a compelling value proposition

102
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:24,458
in a segment this week.

103
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:29,210
In a nutshell, the value proposition
can be stated very succinctly

104
00:05:29,212 --> 00:05:33,036
within these one or two sentences
that you see next to me here.

105
00:05:33,037 --> 00:05:37,897
The sentence says, "As a result
of our" offerings or product or service,

106
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:40,991
"customers"
-- you would fill in the profile --

107
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:44,348
"who are facing" some kind of need,

108
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:48,240
some kind of shortcoming,
some kind of customer pain,

109
00:05:48,241 --> 00:05:52,499
"will" do, experience, something
"for" a certain cost

110
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,499
"and enjoy" the customer
benefits or some return,

111
00:05:56,499 --> 00:05:59,335
within or by a certain timeframe;

112
00:05:59,344 --> 00:06:02,738
and then the competitive element
comes in by saying,

113
00:06:02,739 --> 00:06:04,976
"compared to" these types of alternatives.

114
00:06:04,977 --> 00:06:07,999
"The advantages of using
our offerings are" bing, bing, bing.

115
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:12,206
So, within that one sentence
you can actually very succinctly portray

116
00:06:12,207 --> 00:06:14,642
what your company offerings are about

117
00:06:14,643 --> 00:06:16,729
or why the customer
should buy your offering

118
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:18,921
and not the one of the competition.

119
00:06:18,922 --> 00:06:21,912
This sentence might sound easy to you,

120
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:25,210
but it's actually hard work to craft
a compelling value proposition.

121
00:06:25,211 --> 00:06:26,701
But I urge you to do this

122
00:06:26,702 --> 00:06:31,692
because you need to have clarity
in your mind what your company is about.

123
00:06:31,693 --> 00:06:35,222
And remember what Drucker said:
your company is about creating a customer,

124
00:06:35,223 --> 00:06:37,544
and not the product or the technology.

125
00:06:37,545 --> 00:06:39,938
So in this sentence you have to understand

126
00:06:39,939 --> 00:06:44,045
why and how you create
a customer and not a product.

127
00:06:44,046 --> 00:06:46,315
And then, moving
to the implementation side

128
00:06:46,316 --> 00:06:48,909
we discussed a couple of elements
in the marketing mix.

129
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:52,499
Remember the product, the price,
the place, the promotion, the process,

130
00:06:52,501 --> 00:06:56,419
the people; and the physical
environment is the seventh piece.

131
00:06:56,420 --> 00:07:01,311
And you can formulate those elements
in an orchestrated manner, once you have

132
00:07:01,312 --> 00:07:04,926
these strategic decisions in place
about your segmentation and positioning.

133
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:07,215
We mentioned that in a segment.

134
00:07:07,216 --> 00:07:09,870
As you remember, there are
a couple of interesting ways,

135
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,113
unconventional ways on how
start-ups can do the marketing.

136
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:16,452
We talked about guerrilla marketing
in that sense, which is oftentimes

137
00:07:16,452 --> 00:07:20,558
a type of marketing that is related
to the promotional activities

138
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:23,204
that you do in the the marketing mix.

139
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:27,899
We discussed a couple of examples
to inspire you, but in essence,

140
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:32,337
what you can imagine in terms
of novel ways of marketing your product,

141
00:07:32,338 --> 00:07:34,983
of getting the attention of customers,

142
00:07:34,984 --> 00:07:37,527
where the idea is really one
where with a small budget

143
00:07:37,527 --> 00:07:41,096
you create a strong leverage
in terms of the attention you get

144
00:07:41,097 --> 00:07:43,500
for your company and its products.

145
00:07:43,501 --> 00:07:46,495
So when we talked about
guerrilla marketing, we also mentioned

146
00:07:46,495 --> 00:07:50,272
that your guerrilla marketing approach,
your implementation there

147
00:07:50,273 --> 00:07:52,917
is oftentimes related
to your promotional activities,

148
00:07:52,918 --> 00:07:57,012
but, of course, this should be in line
with your positioning of your company

149
00:07:57,013 --> 00:08:02,625
and what your target segment
actually likes to see about your company.

150
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:07,417
Don't offend your target segment just
with any crazy type of guerrilla campaign

151
00:08:07,418 --> 00:08:10,082
because that could be
highly detrimental for you

152
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,575
if it's to create a successful company.

153
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:15,654
In addition, we talked about
crowdfunding as a marketing tool.

154
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:19,623
Remember that we will come back
to this topic in another week

155
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:22,413
when we'll talk about
crowdfunding as a financing tool,

156
00:08:22,414 --> 00:08:24,028
but from a marketing perspective,

157
00:08:24,028 --> 00:08:26,547
crowdfunding has a couple
of very interesting aspects.

158
00:08:26,548 --> 00:08:29,913
And as you may remember, it helps you
to test and validate your market,

159
00:08:29,913 --> 00:08:32,921
put your ideas out there,
observe investor behavior.

160
00:08:32,922 --> 00:08:35,756
It helps you to build a list of "backers"

161
00:08:35,756 --> 00:08:38,880
and build relationships
to potential customers.

162
00:08:38,881 --> 00:08:41,629
It also helps you build brand recognition,

163
00:08:41,629 --> 00:08:44,030
and ultimately, to boost growth
and offer discounts

164
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,839
on new or current products
that you are developing.

165
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:52,658
Crowdfunding platforms are actually
providing lots of non-financial gains

166
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:56,680
and that's oftentimes overlooked,
so I think it's important

167
00:08:56,681 --> 00:08:58,908
that you engage
in these types of activities

168
00:08:58,909 --> 00:09:00,648
in order to launch your venture.

169
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:04,616
So we talked about two more elements:
technology adoption and growth hacking.

170
00:09:04,617 --> 00:09:08,270
Technology adoption: remember
the technology adoption life cycle,

171
00:09:08,271 --> 00:09:11,791
in particular, one element
that was crucial

172
00:09:11,792 --> 00:09:13,832
which was the idea of crossing the chasm.

173
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:18,457
Remember, that we had a chasm
between the early adopters

174
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:21,749
and the early majority of people
in a target segment.

175
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:26,141
Remember also that these people
differ in terms of their responsiveness

176
00:09:26,142 --> 00:09:29,017
and their willingness
to buy innovative products.

177
00:09:29,018 --> 00:09:32,964
And where the trap oftentimes is located:

178
00:09:32,965 --> 00:09:35,297
between early adopters
and the early majority.

179
00:09:35,298 --> 00:09:38,609
And there is a trap in the following way:

180
00:09:38,626 --> 00:09:43,868
you as an entrepreneur achieve
first sales, you are successful,

181
00:09:43,869 --> 00:09:46,556
so the natural inclination is
to put even more money

182
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:51,502
behind your product,
your marketing campaign, etc.

183
00:09:52,853 --> 00:09:55,508
But you overlooked
actually the next segment

184
00:09:55,508 --> 00:09:58,211
that you want to conquer: 
the early majority,

185
00:09:58,212 --> 00:10:01,043
where you start making a lot of money.

186
00:10:01,044 --> 00:10:03,543
That segment buys for different reasons.

187
00:10:03,543 --> 00:10:06,552
So keep in mind
that in order to cross that chasm

188
00:10:06,553 --> 00:10:08,570
you need to change 
your marketing message,

189
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:11,154
you need to change 
how you communicate with customers,

190
00:10:11,154 --> 00:10:16,260
what type of profile of related services
you might want to offer to them, etc.

191
00:10:16,261 --> 00:10:20,115
And finally, we talked about
achieving significant growth.

192
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:23,267
This is obviously one key goal
that many entrepreneurs have,

193
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:26,446
and that's ultimately one key element
of entrepreneurial marketing.

194
00:10:26,446 --> 00:10:28,685
In order to understand
how to achieve growth,

195
00:10:28,686 --> 00:10:31,496
you have to understand
in terms of the venture design

196
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,324
the scalability of your venture,

197
00:10:33,324 --> 00:10:36,906
and you have to understand
how you can accelerate growth

198
00:10:36,906 --> 00:10:39,031
by relentlessly focusing on growth.

199
00:10:39,031 --> 00:10:42,057
So you can look at the marketing
mix elements that we discussed

200
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,360
through a lens that allows you to grow,

201
00:10:45,361 --> 00:10:49,828
and to try to design these elements
in a way that it allows you to grow.

202
00:10:49,828 --> 00:10:53,834
Oftentimes this is referred to 
nowadays as growth hacking.

203
00:10:53,838 --> 00:10:55,930
So you can also think about creative ways

204
00:10:55,931 --> 00:10:58,449
of how to piggyback
on the growth of other companies.

205
00:10:58,449 --> 00:11:01,481
We discussed some examples
regarding this as well.

206
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:05,744
So this brings us already to the very end
of Week 3 -- time flies.

207
00:11:05,745 --> 00:11:09,537
This was Week 3 
with entrepreneurial marketing

208
00:11:09,538 --> 00:11:11,440
as its core topic, as I pointed out.

209
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:15,731
This week we have learned
a couple of very important frameworks,

210
00:11:15,732 --> 00:11:18,025
ways to understand
entrepreneurial marketing.

211
00:11:18,026 --> 00:11:20,999
The marketing function is
of vital importance for your company,

212
00:11:20,999 --> 00:11:23,252
so pay attention to it,

213
00:11:23,253 --> 00:11:27,139
pay attention to designing your marketing
in the most favorable way,

214
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:30,593
and pay attention
to its execution as well.

215
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:32,586
So good luck with your marketing efforts.

216
00:11:32,586 --> 00:11:33,942
I'll see you around.
