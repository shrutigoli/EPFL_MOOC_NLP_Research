1
00:00:09,827 --> 00:00:12,237
Welcome back to Week 3 
and the segment

2
00:00:12,237 --> 00:00:14,193
Guerrilla Marketing
and the Marketing Mix.

3
00:00:14,605 --> 00:00:17,773
Today's session 
is essentially about implementation

4
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:19,157
of your marketing strategies,

5
00:00:19,157 --> 00:00:22,254
and that's also why I'm wearing my vest,
in order to signal to you

6
00:00:22,254 --> 00:00:26,392
that this is a hands-on subject
that we're going to be talking about today

7
00:00:26,392 --> 00:00:31,183
and that it actually should be aligned
with the strategy that you have developed

8
00:00:31,183 --> 00:00:32,750
in the previous sessions,

9
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,545
meaning the segmentation of your market

10
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:38,018
and how your customers 
should perceive your product,

11
00:00:38,018 --> 00:00:40,210
either positioning of your product,

12
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:43,102
vis-à-vis the competition 
towards your customers.

13
00:00:43,762 --> 00:00:45,895
These two decisions 
on the strategic level

14
00:00:45,895 --> 00:00:48,995
really form the backbone 
of what we will be discussing today

15
00:00:48,995 --> 00:00:52,283
because they should give you 
the guidelines, the general thrust

16
00:00:52,283 --> 00:00:55,175
for what you will be implementing
in the marketing mix.

17
00:00:55,562 --> 00:00:59,247
There are more creative elements
that you can also use

18
00:00:59,247 --> 00:01:00,860
in entrepreneurial marketing.

19
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,008
We label them <i>guerilla marketing</i>,
like a guerrilla fighter

20
00:01:04,008 --> 00:01:06,044
who's fighting with little resources

21
00:01:06,044 --> 00:01:09,800
and tries to achieve maximum output
or maximum effects.

22
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,318
That's actually the situation 
that an entrepreneur finds himself in.

23
00:01:13,746 --> 00:01:15,010
What we will be discussing

24
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,808
is also some tools and tricks 
that you can apply

25
00:01:17,808 --> 00:01:21,472
in order to have a very efficient type 
of marketing in new venture creation.

26
00:01:21,596 --> 00:01:24,923
I have some very interesting,
nice examples to share with you.

27
00:01:24,923 --> 00:01:29,671
When we think about the marketing mix, 
conventionally, there were four P's:

28
00:01:29,671 --> 00:01:31,704
price, product, promotion, place.

29
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:38,112
This has been enlarged to seven P's 
in more recent editions of this concept.

30
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:41,277
Let me briefly walk you through 
an overview here

31
00:01:41,277 --> 00:01:43,906
and then focus on each 
and every one of them.

32
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:47,457
The marketing mix 
is really concerned with

33
00:01:47,457 --> 00:01:49,012
the implementations suggested.

34
00:01:49,237 --> 00:01:53,111
It's about how your product 
will be designed.

35
00:01:53,326 --> 00:01:55,394
It's about the pricing 
of your product.

36
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:59,346
It's about the place, 
I mean the distribution of your product.

37
00:01:59,346 --> 00:02:03,588
It's about the promotional elements
that accompany your marketing effort.

38
00:02:03,588 --> 00:02:06,945
It's about the process. 
It's about the people.

39
00:02:06,945 --> 00:02:09,577
It's also about the physical environment,

40
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:12,570
which is oftentimes referring to 
the store environment in which

41
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,405
you may sell your goods.

42
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:19,591
Each of these elements 
has a couple of decision points to them.

43
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:24,633
And as you see already by looking 
at the name of these elements,

44
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:26,258
this is really hands-on as I said.

45
00:02:26,258 --> 00:02:29,846
Let's walk you through 
some of these decision points

46
00:02:29,846 --> 00:02:33,504
and what you can possibly do 
about the product, price, place, etc.,

47
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:35,469
what are common fallacies,

48
00:02:35,482 --> 00:02:37,681
what are common recommendations
in that sense.

49
00:02:37,768 --> 00:02:40,506
Let me also stress 
that, at the end of the day,

50
00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:45,179
these all need to form a coherent view.

51
00:02:45,179 --> 00:02:48,211
This needs to be coherently set,

52
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:51,808
designed so that the customer 
ultimately will see this

53
00:02:51,808 --> 00:02:54,301
as a product offering 
with right price

54
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:58,365
that is distributed 
through those distribution chains

55
00:02:58,365 --> 00:03:03,916
that are most appealing 
to your customer target market, etc.

56
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:07,468
Let's move through this one by one.

57
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:10,386
One core element that is essential

58
00:03:10,386 --> 00:03:12,525
in the entrepreneurial 
marketing approach is,

59
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,217
of course, the price you set.

60
00:03:14,217 --> 00:03:17,512
How much would a customer 
have to pay for your offering?

61
00:03:17,908 --> 00:03:21,168
This is a vital consideration 
to the customer

62
00:03:21,168 --> 00:03:24,235
because this determines 
whether he or she wants to buy the good.

63
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:27,357
But it's also vital to you 
as an entrepreneurial company

64
00:03:27,357 --> 00:03:30,052
because the price the customer pays

65
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:33,940
and how many customers will find 
that product attractive at that price

66
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:35,428
will determine your cash flows.

67
00:03:35,428 --> 00:03:40,223
And that determines, of course, 
whether you as a company can survive.

68
00:03:40,223 --> 00:03:43,232
So the pricing decision 
is one that is extremely vital.

69
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:46,177
There are also problems 
that are associated with that

70
00:03:46,177 --> 00:03:49,809
because it's not so easy to determine
the right price.

71
00:03:49,809 --> 00:03:53,633
Oftentimes, an approach 
that is recommended

72
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:56,882
is that you want to start 
with understanding

73
00:03:56,882 --> 00:04:00,321
how valuable this product is 
to your customer.

74
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:05,030
This means the value 
that you're creating for your customer.

75
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,526
That can be a starting point.

76
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:08,763
Then you can say, "Well, 
this is my cost level,

77
00:04:08,763 --> 00:04:11,046
and this is the value 
I render to my customers."

78
00:04:11,046 --> 00:04:13,401
Somewhere in between 
should be the optimum price.

79
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,841
Cost-plus pricing 
is also oftentimes done,

80
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:19,380
which means you have your cost,

81
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,595
and you add something on top 
of your cost -- let's say, 20 percent.

82
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:26,610
Is this a good way of pricing? 
Think about it.

83
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,807
<i>It's not!</i> Because the customer 
might get much, much more value

84
00:04:30,807 --> 00:04:32,657
out of your good

85
00:04:32,657 --> 00:04:36,088
than what your cost base is 
plus this 20 percent.

86
00:04:36,088 --> 00:04:39,449
You're leaving money 
on the table constantly,

87
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:42,642
which means, well, 
the value accrues not to you

88
00:04:42,642 --> 00:04:45,729
but to your marketplace, 
which is nice for the marketplace.

89
00:04:45,729 --> 00:04:49,710
But hey, you want to create a company
that is successful in gross.

90
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,589
In that sense, there are couple 
of key issues that you can walk through.

91
00:04:56,446 --> 00:05:01,310
We've provided some backup material
on our website that you can refer to

92
00:05:01,310 --> 00:05:03,551
in order to understand
what is scheming pricing,

93
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:05,837
penetration pricing, 
psychological pricing, etc.

94
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:07,649
We do not have the time 
in the segment

95
00:05:07,649 --> 00:05:09,889
to walk you through 
each one of these elements.

96
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:11,937
But let me just point out 
one key question,

97
00:05:11,937 --> 00:05:15,124
which is the question that you should have
in the back of your mind.

98
00:05:15,124 --> 00:05:18,915
The question: "Which price 
actually maximizes long-term profits?"

99
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:22,745
This is, of course, an issue 
that has to do

100
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:24,763
with segmentation positioning.

101
00:05:25,775 --> 00:05:27,047
This is evident.

102
00:05:27,241 --> 00:05:28,989
It's the strategic guidance.

103
00:05:28,989 --> 00:05:31,148
There's also some psychological effect.

104
00:05:31,715 --> 00:05:33,715
Your business model 
has some implications,

105
00:05:33,715 --> 00:05:36,281
the competition now or later.

106
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,571
Think about the markets you're in.

107
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:40,493
Oftentimes, these are 
dynamic markets

108
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:43,447
so more and more companies 
will enter those domains.

109
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:47,023
And of course, 
the customer's perceived benefit.

110
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:51,715
That's what I exactly refer to 
when I talk about value-based pricing.

111
00:05:52,128 --> 00:05:56,847
Also, the price elasticity, 
which means if I change my prices

112
00:05:56,847 --> 00:06:01,585
for a certain percentage 
like, let's say, 5 percent higher,

113
00:06:01,585 --> 00:06:04,393
how many more customers 
would actually buy my product,

114
00:06:04,393 --> 00:06:07,020
or how many customers 
would I lose that way?

115
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,030
If you have a luxury good,

116
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:11,797
maybe increasing the price 
might make it more attractive.

117
00:06:11,797 --> 00:06:13,965
And thinking about pricing,

118
00:06:13,965 --> 00:06:16,259
take into account
that there are also options

119
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:19,893
where you actually give 
the product away for free.

120
00:06:20,704 --> 00:06:24,914
There's a <i>freemium pricing model</i>
where you have, for instance,

121
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:28,338
a plain vanilla version of your product
that is given away for free,

122
00:06:28,338 --> 00:06:31,558
and then you have a sophisticated version 
that allows professionals

123
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:35,596
to do many more things 
with your product

124
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:37,951
for which you're going to charge
a certain price.

125
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:42,970
This is oftentimes a pricing model
that is useful for those markets

126
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:45,881
where you have to want to achieve
a rapid penetration.

127
00:06:45,881 --> 00:06:47,752
Of course, with a product that's free,

128
00:06:48,604 --> 00:06:51,001
there are some advantages
in terms of penetration.

129
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:54,101
This is one real example of a company

130
00:06:54,101 --> 00:06:56,276
that dealt with that brilliantly: 
it's Adobe.

131
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:59,404
They had the Acrobat Reader 
that was given out for free.

132
00:06:59,404 --> 00:07:01,070
Many of you probably use it.

133
00:07:01,070 --> 00:07:04,215
Then there's the Acrobat Distiller
and other versions that are sold

134
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:06,501
and where the company
actually makes some profit.

135
00:07:06,501 --> 00:07:11,290
Another wonderful example 
about pricing is provided by Nespresso.

136
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:15,113
You may know the coffee capsules 
by this company

137
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,894
that is actually owned by Nestle,

138
00:07:17,894 --> 00:07:19,893
which is a company 
just down the road here

139
00:07:19,893 --> 00:07:21,372
from Lausanne, where I'm based.

140
00:07:21,792 --> 00:07:23,844
What they are doing 
is actually quite smart

141
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:27,573
because if you think about it, 
Nespresso relies on the customers

142
00:07:27,573 --> 00:07:31,714
having coffee machines 
that are compatible with their capsules,

143
00:07:31,714 --> 00:07:34,140
and it relies on the sales
of the capsules.

144
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,870
They could say, "Well, we price 
the coffee machines highly.

145
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:41,263
And then we are profiting 
from the sales."

146
00:07:41,263 --> 00:07:46,003
That might hinder people actually 
from buying the coffee machines.

147
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:47,527
That will then hinder the people

148
00:07:47,527 --> 00:07:49,637
from actually using 
and buying the capsules.

149
00:07:49,976 --> 00:07:52,175
So in that sense, 
in order to enter the market

150
00:07:52,175 --> 00:07:54,933
and penetrate the market, 
it's of vital importance to them

151
00:07:54,933 --> 00:07:57,025
to keep the price 
of the coffee machine low.

152
00:07:57,025 --> 00:07:59,219
So they have 
very low profit margins on those.

153
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:01,504
But they have much higher 
profit margins, then,

154
00:08:01,504 --> 00:08:03,456
on the capsules that are repeatedly sold.

155
00:08:03,456 --> 00:08:06,376
In some estimates, 
that's up to 85 percent of profit margin

156
00:08:06,376 --> 00:08:08,896
on that coffee capsule, 
which is amazing.

157
00:08:10,042 --> 00:08:12,862
This is another interesting example
on that effect.

158
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:14,777
The second key element

159
00:08:14,777 --> 00:08:17,686
that is of importance 
here is the product.

160
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:20,450
The product has a number 
of decision dimensions

161
00:08:20,450 --> 00:08:23,002
that you need to think about 
in your marketing mix.

162
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,241
It's about the design,

163
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:26,341
it's about the technology 
that goes inside,

164
00:08:26,341 --> 00:08:27,997
the quality, 
it's packaging --

165
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:30,337
and a couple of others, 
but these are oftentimes

166
00:08:30,337 --> 00:08:32,004
the four most important ones.

167
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,589
Of course, these need to fit 
the overall strategy.

168
00:08:35,589 --> 00:08:38,565
Meaning, you target customers

169
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:41,189
and how they should perceive you
and your product

170
00:08:41,189 --> 00:08:43,180
vis-à-vis the competition's product.

171
00:08:43,711 --> 00:08:48,947
More concretely, this means 
if your target market segment

172
00:08:48,947 --> 00:08:50,711
would be affluent people

173
00:08:50,711 --> 00:08:54,554
and you're trying to produce a product
that is on the luxury segment,

174
00:08:54,554 --> 00:08:58,161
of course, this has to be visible 
in its design, in its quality,

175
00:08:58,161 --> 00:09:00,944
in the packaging of your good.

176
00:09:01,169 --> 00:09:04,570
Otherwise, if your packaging 
is a cheap type of packaging,

177
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,709
there's cognitive dissonance 
on part of the customers.

178
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:09,968
They might not say,

179
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:12,626
"Well, this is a product 
that actually fits my needs."

180
00:09:12,626 --> 00:09:14,349
They would not consider buying it.

181
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:18,582
This has to fit with the segmentation
and positioning, too.

182
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,926
The third element is promotion.

183
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:27,267
What is important here to understand
is promotion is not just advertising.

184
00:09:27,267 --> 00:09:29,770
It's many different things. 
We listed them here.

185
00:09:29,770 --> 00:09:34,382
It's advertising, of course, 
but it's also having special offers.

186
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:38,265
It's direct mailing. 
It's maybe a free gift.

187
00:09:38,265 --> 00:09:41,519
It's leaflets. It's other things 
that you might want to engage in

188
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,281
in order to actually promote your product.

189
00:09:44,281 --> 00:09:46,696
There are multiple ways 
of promoting your product.

190
00:09:46,696 --> 00:09:48,946
Think about it. 
Maybe in that way, they'll say,

191
00:09:48,946 --> 00:09:51,798
"Okay, I want to transport 
a message to you,

192
00:09:51,798 --> 00:09:53,767
my potential customers."

193
00:09:53,767 --> 00:09:56,402
There are multiple ways 
of getting this message across.

194
00:09:56,402 --> 00:09:58,032
Advertising is just one of them.

195
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:01,660
That guy with a loudspeaker
might be another option.

196
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:06,905
Free gifts might be also another --
a coffee mug with the branding on it.

197
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,625
If you're, for instance, 
selling office goods

198
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,294
and they have this coffee mug
in their office

199
00:10:13,294 --> 00:10:16,806
with the brand of that company 
providing office goods,

200
00:10:17,559 --> 00:10:19,841
that's all day long on their desk,

201
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:22,471
and they see this logo 
a couple of times each day.

202
00:10:22,471 --> 00:10:24,254
Their colleagues see this logo.

203
00:10:24,254 --> 00:10:28,003
Of course, these people 
are more aware of your company

204
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:30,731
and the product it offers 
than other people's companies

205
00:10:30,731 --> 00:10:32,678
where they are not on the desks often.

206
00:10:33,546 --> 00:10:35,938
Then there's another form 
of promotion

207
00:10:35,938 --> 00:10:39,490
that is quite essential 
to many start-up firms.

208
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,926
It's public relations.

209
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:43,067
This is a low-cost alternative

210
00:10:43,067 --> 00:10:45,373
when you don't spend 
much money on that.

211
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:47,965
It's perceived typically
as advertising

212
00:10:47,965 --> 00:10:53,441
that is not being paid for 
by the company.

213
00:10:53,441 --> 00:10:56,287
For instance, press releases, 
so you have a reporter

214
00:10:56,287 --> 00:10:58,803
reporting about your innovation.

215
00:10:58,803 --> 00:11:02,236
That's actually often something that 
the reporters would like to engage.

216
00:11:02,236 --> 00:11:04,286
They're in search 
for good stories as well.

217
00:11:04,286 --> 00:11:06,714
If you have a good story to tell 
with your product,

218
00:11:06,714 --> 00:11:09,371
why not approach newspapers 
and press agencies

219
00:11:09,371 --> 00:11:10,920
to talk about your product?

220
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:15,623
They might advertise it that way 
in their article for free.

221
00:11:15,924 --> 00:11:17,640
It's an important way 
to build trust

222
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,446
because it's an outside party 
reporting about your company.

223
00:11:20,967 --> 00:11:25,747
It increases awareness. 
It could signal potential for the future.

224
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,078
When you think about public relations

225
00:11:28,078 --> 00:11:32,203
and the way you're going to transport 
your message through PR,

226
00:11:32,203 --> 00:11:36,215
think also about the different types 
of people out there

227
00:11:36,215 --> 00:11:39,590
who could be more or less helpful 
in transporting that message.

228
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:43,735
There are some people out there 
who have two million Twitter followers

229
00:11:43,735 --> 00:11:45,905
while others have only a dozen.

230
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,978
Of course, 
the ones who have two million

231
00:11:47,978 --> 00:11:50,807
would be better in transporting PR

232
00:11:50,807 --> 00:11:53,738
than the ones with a couple of leads only.

233
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,982
We typically say there are 
some gurus out there,

234
00:11:56,982 --> 00:11:58,186
key people in the market,

235
00:11:58,186 --> 00:12:00,833
some authorities 
who can influence many, many others.

236
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:04,832
Then there are some influencers, 
maybe some industry peers, experts,

237
00:12:04,832 --> 00:12:07,092
opinion leaders, key customers.

238
00:12:07,092 --> 00:12:10,647
Then there are some additional 
decision makers who get their messages,

239
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,589
either directly from you with the PR

240
00:12:12,589 --> 00:12:15,595
or are shaped by what the gurus 
and the influencers think.

241
00:12:16,355 --> 00:12:19,419
There are oftentimes 
companies in an industry

242
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,273
who look up to other companies and say,

243
00:12:21,273 --> 00:12:26,477
"These other companies are leading 
in terms of technology,

244
00:12:26,477 --> 00:12:29,295
in terms of customer approaches, 
in terms of their product.

245
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:32,723
We closely follow what they are doing
and then mimic what they're doing."

246
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,288
That's exactly 
what I want to stress here.

247
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:39,735
Try to get the gurus and influencers
to talk about your company,

248
00:12:39,735 --> 00:12:44,844
then these guys will relate the message
in addition to what your efforts are.

249
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:50,460
But also, think about what these guys 
would take away from doing that.

250
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:53,534
Maybe they only want to have 
an interesting story.

251
00:12:53,534 --> 00:12:56,350
Maybe they want to have
other types of benefits

252
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,676
that are related to that.

253
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:01,844
Another element is the place, 
i.e. where can the product be bought?

254
00:13:01,844 --> 00:13:05,749
This is a key element for marketing, 
market entry, and penetration.

255
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:10,958
It actually means the distribution channel
that you're going to adopt.

256
00:13:11,427 --> 00:13:13,084
Is it retail? Is it wholesale?

257
00:13:13,084 --> 00:13:16,123
Maybe mail order, Internet, 
direct sales, peer-to-peer,

258
00:13:16,123 --> 00:13:18,113
maybe multichannel approaches.

259
00:13:18,244 --> 00:13:21,289
Whatever you decide, you make sure
that you are targeting

260
00:13:21,289 --> 00:13:24,013
with your distribution channel 
exactly the segment

261
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:27,275
that you want to address 
so that you do not --

262
00:13:27,275 --> 00:13:30,693
some segments actually have preferences
for one or the other channel,

263
00:13:30,693 --> 00:13:34,451
so find out where they buy 
and how often they buy,

264
00:13:34,451 --> 00:13:38,697
if they would like to prefer 
buying the good maybe in a different way.

265
00:13:39,257 --> 00:13:42,638
It's not said that if they keep on buying
in a retail store

266
00:13:42,638 --> 00:13:45,807
that they would not be willing and able

267
00:13:45,807 --> 00:13:48,275
to switch to online buying, for instance.

268
00:13:49,067 --> 00:13:50,826
Another key element are the people.

269
00:13:51,448 --> 00:13:53,100
These are your employees.

270
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,303
It's you as the management,
it's the culture of your company

271
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,318
because all of these
will shape interaction

272
00:13:59,318 --> 00:14:00,926
with your customers.

273
00:14:00,926 --> 00:14:05,145
It will shape the impression 
that customers have of your company.

274
00:14:05,145 --> 00:14:08,858
It will shape how the customer service 
is actually executed,

275
00:14:08,858 --> 00:14:13,263
how customers will deal 
with your company.

276
00:14:13,263 --> 00:14:16,542
If you think about that, 
that's actually of vital importance

277
00:14:16,542 --> 00:14:19,938
because that shapes 
the customer's experience.

278
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:22,559
They will come back if they are happy
with your company,

279
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:24,799
if they think you are doing 
a professional job,

280
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,959
but they won't come back if you lose out 
on the customer service.

281
00:14:29,950 --> 00:14:33,519
Make sure that the people dimension 
is one that you take into consideration

282
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,644
because it has a lot to do 
with the solid implementation

283
00:14:36,644 --> 00:14:38,278
of your marketing mix.

284
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:41,859
Then two more points. 
One is the process.

285
00:14:41,859 --> 00:14:46,654
The process element is of high relevance
for more service-oriented ventures.

286
00:14:46,654 --> 00:14:50,823
Think about how the customer 
would consume your service.

287
00:14:51,372 --> 00:14:54,916
It also can be relevant 
to product-related purchases.

288
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:58,226
You might have warranty issues.

289
00:14:58,226 --> 00:15:01,472
You might have other inter-linkages
with your company,

290
00:15:01,472 --> 00:15:03,095
on the website, etc.

291
00:15:03,095 --> 00:15:05,152
The process dimension is also one

292
00:15:05,152 --> 00:15:07,484
that you might want to consider
on that front.

293
00:15:07,484 --> 00:15:10,120
Finally, it's also about 
the physical environment.

294
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,612
That means the environment in which
the customer consumes the service

295
00:15:14,129 --> 00:15:17,675
or gets in touch with your company
to purchase a product, or both.

296
00:15:17,848 --> 00:15:21,173
Think about the interface
that is created by your company

297
00:15:21,173 --> 00:15:25,277
to have the customer 
on the site in a store.

298
00:15:25,797 --> 00:15:29,843
Maybe it's your company store.
There's different levels of comfort.

299
00:15:29,843 --> 00:15:32,426
The facilities may 
or may not be posh, etc.

300
00:15:33,379 --> 00:15:35,592
What this means is that 
physical environment

301
00:15:35,603 --> 00:15:40,189
actually shapes the perception 
of who you are as a company quite a lot.

302
00:15:40,613 --> 00:15:44,233
It also shapes the customer's experience
with your company quite a lot.

303
00:15:45,003 --> 00:15:46,800
Ideally, of course, that should match

304
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,371
who you want to be seen as, 
as a company.

305
00:15:50,858 --> 00:15:54,327
Like, what is your positioning 
and what is your segmentation?

306
00:15:55,288 --> 00:15:58,708
These are the seven key elements
of the marketing mix.

307
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,451
It's a mix of elements.

308
00:16:00,451 --> 00:16:04,418
They should be implemented 
in an orchestrated fashion.

309
00:16:04,418 --> 00:16:10,234
What's important to consider is that, 
of course, it should be orchestrated

310
00:16:10,234 --> 00:16:11,603
with the marketing strategy.

311
00:16:11,603 --> 00:16:14,981
It also depends upon rivals' behavior, 
global considerations,

312
00:16:14,981 --> 00:16:18,811
cultural issues, religion, etc.,
in some nations.

313
00:16:18,811 --> 00:16:22,174
Depending on who you are, 
these type of elements,

314
00:16:22,174 --> 00:16:26,678
as they are implementing the strategy, 
should breathe basically the norms

315
00:16:26,678 --> 00:16:31,275
and the institutional elements 
of your particular geography.

316
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:34,755
Now, building on these seven P's,
you might ask yourself:

317
00:16:34,755 --> 00:16:37,140
Are there more interesting ways,
more creative ways

318
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:39,569
of engaging in your marketing?

319
00:16:40,558 --> 00:16:44,255
Everyone can spend 
the normal amount of money

320
00:16:44,255 --> 00:16:46,153
in order to implement it to marketing.

321
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:50,299
But the smart people spend imagination
instead of money.

322
00:16:50,299 --> 00:16:53,736
That means, maybe 
let's find unconventional ways

323
00:16:53,736 --> 00:16:57,919
of pursuing the conventional goals, 
meaning, achieving sales,

324
00:16:57,919 --> 00:16:59,998
achieving market penetration.

325
00:17:01,538 --> 00:17:04,342
That can actually filter down, 
trickle down

326
00:17:04,342 --> 00:17:06,083
to all the marketing mix elements.

327
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:09,122
Oftentimes, guerrilla marketing 
is an approach

328
00:17:09,122 --> 00:17:11,279
that is used mostly 
with communication,

329
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,168
sometimes with pricing, 
sometimes with product issues,

330
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:15,853
sometimes with distribution issues.

331
00:17:15,853 --> 00:17:19,141
Most often, there are interesting ways 
of communicating your product,

332
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:22,081
communicating about its benefits,

333
00:17:22,686 --> 00:17:25,168
communicating about 
its availability, etc.,

334
00:17:25,765 --> 00:17:28,526
that will then make a splash 
in the marketplace.

335
00:17:28,526 --> 00:17:32,452
In other words, you're finding ways
in order to, with little effort,

336
00:17:32,452 --> 00:17:33,685
make a big splash.

337
00:17:34,341 --> 00:17:36,297
That means you need to be creative

338
00:17:36,297 --> 00:17:40,108
because there are lots of people out there
who are trying to do exactly that.

339
00:17:40,902 --> 00:17:43,862
Let me give you some intuition 
and maybe even some inspiration

340
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:46,638
of what this means 
in terms of guerrilla marketing.

341
00:17:46,638 --> 00:17:48,411
This is one of my favorite examples.

342
00:17:48,411 --> 00:17:50,443
Actually, this is a company 
called YOC.

343
00:17:50,443 --> 00:17:53,239
YOC is a firm located in Berlin.

344
00:17:53,239 --> 00:17:57,038
It used to be a start-up. 
It's grown up quite a bit.

345
00:17:57,038 --> 00:17:59,095
But in its early days, 
it faced a challenge

346
00:17:59,095 --> 00:18:01,356
that was actually quite a big challenge.

347
00:18:01,936 --> 00:18:06,963
They are a company that are providing
mobile marketing services for firms.

348
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:13,267
When you think about it, well, 
they have a chicken-egg problem in a way

349
00:18:13,949 --> 00:18:16,808
because where should they start?

350
00:18:16,991 --> 00:18:19,922
They do not have phone numbers
of the customers.

351
00:18:19,922 --> 00:18:23,771
They do not have references
in terms of great marketing campaigns

352
00:18:23,771 --> 00:18:26,066
with which they could go to companies.

353
00:18:26,066 --> 00:18:29,771
In a sense, they are lacking 
in all of these dimensions.

354
00:18:29,771 --> 00:18:33,347
What they did in order to create awareness
for the company

355
00:18:33,347 --> 00:18:37,362
and also to collect 
the customer information

356
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:38,810
is to create an event.

357
00:18:39,511 --> 00:18:42,574
What's this Crash or Cash event 
that YOC engaged in?

358
00:18:42,574 --> 00:18:46,335
It's an event that they designed together
with Radio Energy,

359
00:18:46,335 --> 00:18:48,641
a radio station in Berlin.

360
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:50,642
What they did is to say,

361
00:18:50,642 --> 00:18:54,955
"Okay, we have an interesting event
happening out there

362
00:18:54,955 --> 00:18:58,028
on the Potsdamer Platz, 
which is right in the middle of Berlin.

363
00:18:58,501 --> 00:19:02,352
We are doing the following. 
We have this Porsche 911,

364
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:05,256
a wonderful Porsche hanging up there
at 50 meters high.

365
00:19:05,256 --> 00:19:08,198
People could vote 
with their cell phones,

366
00:19:08,198 --> 00:19:12,490
whether this Porsche should crash 
i.e. fall down these 50 meters,

367
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:16,839
or whether some of the people, 
one person,

368
00:19:16,839 --> 00:19:20,756
would actually win the car at the end,
which means cash."

369
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:23,131
There was an event, with bands,

370
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:25,524
with a large screen
for the status of the ballot.

371
00:19:25,830 --> 00:19:30,425
The result was 53 percent said crash 
and 47 percent said cash,

372
00:19:30,425 --> 00:19:32,460
so you actually know what that meant.

373
00:19:32,681 --> 00:19:35,709
The Porsche fell down. 
I have a picture of that in a minute.

374
00:19:35,709 --> 00:19:39,067
I think what the 
important element here is --

375
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,300
and if you can think about it 
beyond just this entertainment factor,

376
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,840
of course, it's wonderful 
and it's interesting to see

377
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,238
this Porsche crashing.

378
00:19:49,238 --> 00:19:54,120
But on the other hand, they created 
a lot of attention for their start-up,

379
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,443
attention for their services.

380
00:19:56,443 --> 00:19:58,351
There was a huge media echo.

381
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:01,069
If you think about how much
it cost them,

382
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:04,046
it was the sum of the price 
for the Porsche.

383
00:20:04,834 --> 00:20:09,858
Beyond that, they had all 
the newspaper coverage they got;

384
00:20:09,858 --> 00:20:15,373
all the TV coverage that they got 
was a high multiple

385
00:20:15,373 --> 00:20:18,357
of what they actually spent 
for the Porsche.

386
00:20:18,462 --> 00:20:20,344
In that sense,
it was a very smart way.

387
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:23,661
It was a little expense
relative to the output

388
00:20:23,661 --> 00:20:25,653
and the outcome
they were able to achieve.

389
00:20:25,653 --> 00:20:30,361
In that sense, a guerrilla marketing event
par excellence.

390
00:20:30,361 --> 00:20:32,699
Let me show you now 
what the Porsche looked like.

391
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:33,924
It looked like this.

392
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:39,463
You can still see that the Porsche
looks like a Porsche,

393
00:20:39,463 --> 00:20:43,702
looks like fairly okay still, 
considering that it fell,

394
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:46,131
it just fell 50 meters. 
You'll see it on the crane.

395
00:20:46,131 --> 00:20:48,898
This is actually quite high, 50 meters. 
Just imagine that.

396
00:20:48,898 --> 00:20:50,929
That's a guerrilla marketing event.

397
00:20:50,929 --> 00:20:54,585
Is that in the textbooks 
of marketing books?

398
00:20:54,585 --> 00:20:57,996
<i>No!</i> It's not there because this is 
very much out of the scope.

399
00:20:57,996 --> 00:21:02,318
It takes creativity and ingenuity
to come up with something like this.

400
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:04,112
But this is actually fun to do.

401
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:08,371
Think about how your company 
might be able to benefit

402
00:21:08,371 --> 00:21:12,172
from some of these events 
or some of these approaches.

403
00:21:12,172 --> 00:21:14,889
Another interesting example 
of guerrilla marketing

404
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:17,117
that might inspire you is ModCloth.

405
00:21:17,117 --> 00:21:19,680
This is a social shopping community.

406
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:21,689
What they did is actually quite smart.

407
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:26,870
They said, "Okay, we are naming 
our dresses after fashion influences

408
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:28,378
namely other bloggers."

409
00:21:28,378 --> 00:21:30,827
Then these guys picked it up 
and blogged about it.

410
00:21:30,827 --> 00:21:35,390
In that sense, in retrospect, 
it's a simple way of getting attention

411
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,544
and spreading the word.

412
00:21:36,544 --> 00:21:40,227
But <i>ex-ante,</i> before the fact,
someone had to have this idea.

413
00:21:41,048 --> 00:21:42,489
So be creative.

414
00:21:42,489 --> 00:21:47,276
Find new ways, find interesting ways
to engage in guerrilla marketing.

415
00:21:48,546 --> 00:21:50,392
Here's an interesting example.

416
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,152
It hurts a bit for the man 
that's standing here.

417
00:21:53,152 --> 00:21:55,026
It's called Fuzz Wax Bar.

418
00:21:55,026 --> 00:21:57,772
This was a new bar 
that wanted to enter the market.

419
00:21:57,772 --> 00:22:00,461
The question is, 
if you have a waxing bar,

420
00:22:00,461 --> 00:22:03,961
when you tear out 
all the hair on your body

421
00:22:03,961 --> 00:22:08,950
to appear sexier maybe, if you want 
to call it that way,

422
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:13,577
how do you create attention, 
awareness for your company?

423
00:22:13,577 --> 00:22:15,656
This is what this bar did.

424
00:22:15,656 --> 00:22:20,124
The Fuzz Wax Bar, they send a person, 
a plastered man in wax

425
00:22:20,124 --> 00:22:24,457
down the streets of Toronto 
in order to be waxed by strangers.

426
00:22:25,255 --> 00:22:28,961
Not only did the potential customers
test the product,

427
00:22:28,961 --> 00:22:31,164
but they surely remember that experience.

428
00:22:31,164 --> 00:22:33,684
If you look at those up here 
on the left,

429
00:22:33,684 --> 00:22:35,773
what they were quite smart 
in doing,

430
00:22:35,773 --> 00:22:40,303
each of these papers 
was actually a coupon:

431
00:22:40,303 --> 00:22:43,973
"Get 25 percent off your next wax 
with this coupon."

432
00:22:44,733 --> 00:22:48,004
They actually created lots of awareness
in the environment

433
00:22:48,004 --> 00:22:50,008
where this wax bar was located.

434
00:22:50,906 --> 00:22:54,044
Here's another example. 
It's a company called <i>Varusteleka. </i>

435
00:22:54,044 --> 00:22:57,394
They are selling 
Finnish army surplus products

436
00:22:57,394 --> 00:22:58,274
to the public.

437
00:22:58,274 --> 00:23:01,480
What they did to create awareness
for the company was the following.

438
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,839
They sent an open letter
in the form of a video

439
00:23:03,839 --> 00:23:07,326
to Arnold Schwarzenegger -- 
yes, the "I'll be back" guy

440
00:23:07,326 --> 00:23:09,823
who has been in lots of videos 
with lots of guns,

441
00:23:09,823 --> 00:23:12,324
so you see the association.

442
00:23:12,324 --> 00:23:16,420
They invited him to visit the store 
and introduce the stuff and the products.

443
00:23:16,420 --> 00:23:19,940
In that sense, it was not a lot 
of effort that they did,

444
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,230
but they had the idea.

445
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,431
This was then picked up 
by the International Press who said,

446
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:27,477
"Oh, this is an interesting story
to report about."

447
00:23:27,724 --> 00:23:30,083
If you look at the YouTube video there,

448
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,302
it had more than 
600,000 clicks at the time.

449
00:23:32,302 --> 00:23:34,804
We looked at it. 
If you look at it as well,

450
00:23:34,804 --> 00:23:37,994
this has many more clicks 
in a few minutes.

451
00:23:37,994 --> 00:23:39,934
Then here are some more examples.

452
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:43,369
I don't walk you through 
all of these one by one,

453
00:23:43,369 --> 00:23:44,549
but just look at that.

454
00:23:44,549 --> 00:23:48,469
It's very creative ways, 
very innovative ways

455
00:23:49,049 --> 00:23:51,185
to even market some existing products.

456
00:23:51,602 --> 00:23:54,099
Of course, this is not only a domain

457
00:23:54,099 --> 00:23:56,978
that entrepreneurial start-ups
are engaging in nowadays.

458
00:23:56,978 --> 00:23:57,958
It's also a domain

459
00:23:57,958 --> 00:24:00,737
that established companies 
have discovered for themselves

460
00:24:00,737 --> 00:24:05,148
because they want to see 
more effects, better outcomes

461
00:24:05,148 --> 00:24:06,997
based on their marketing expenditures.

462
00:24:06,997 --> 00:24:11,883
The traditional ways are just not enough
to get the attention of customers anymore.

463
00:24:13,045 --> 00:24:15,496
This brings us already to the end 
of an interesting

464
00:24:15,496 --> 00:24:18,667
and also, I think, funny type
of segment here.

465
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:22,031
Let's just recap a couple of points
that I want you to remember.

466
00:24:22,109 --> 00:24:25,681
First, the marketing mix 
is the vehicle for you

467
00:24:25,681 --> 00:24:27,462
to implement your marketing strategy.

468
00:24:27,462 --> 00:24:29,256
We talked about this repeatedly.

469
00:24:29,256 --> 00:24:31,716
The marketing strategy provides 
the guidelines

470
00:24:31,716 --> 00:24:33,664
for an orchestrated implementation.

471
00:24:33,664 --> 00:24:36,652
It will make it much easier for you 
to find a clearer way

472
00:24:36,652 --> 00:24:40,375
of actually designing and implementing
your marketing mix elements.

473
00:24:40,375 --> 00:24:43,462
We talked about some creative 
low-cost approaches

474
00:24:43,462 --> 00:24:45,318
that are often key to start-up success.

475
00:24:45,838 --> 00:24:49,709
As a company, as a young company,
you often lack resources.

476
00:24:49,709 --> 00:24:52,205
Guerrilla marketing 
might be one way

477
00:24:52,205 --> 00:24:56,366
of actually getting a lot 
out of limited resources.

478
00:24:56,366 --> 00:24:59,732
Ultimately, like in more 
general entrepreneurship,

479
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,122
what is particular here?

480
00:25:01,122 --> 00:25:04,005
Spend imagination 
instead of money

481
00:25:04,005 --> 00:25:06,585
and enjoy that intellectual challenge.

482
00:25:06,585 --> 00:25:07,819
See you next time.
