1
00:00:07,954 --> 00:00:08,954
Welcome back!

2
00:00:08,954 --> 00:00:11,201
In this segment we are going
to talk about understanding

3
00:00:11,201 --> 00:00:13,523
your customers and your competition.

4
00:00:13,523 --> 00:00:18,239
Two key issues that are of importance for
developing your marketing plan,

5
00:00:18,239 --> 00:00:21,155
and for developing your accompanying 
marketing agenda.

6
00:00:21,155 --> 00:00:23,685
But, before we delve into this topic,

7
00:00:23,685 --> 00:00:26,731
I want you to step back and think about it
from the customers perspective

8
00:00:26,731 --> 00:00:28,499
and not the entrepreneur perspective.

9
00:00:28,499 --> 00:00:32,650
Think about your daily purchasing 
decisions for a minute.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,710
You are in an environment where you get 
constantly bombarded with new information

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,134
where you have lots of products 
to choose from.

12
00:00:40,134 --> 00:00:43,700
And sophisticated buyers actually 
check out online

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:46,273
where the cheapest product is available.

14
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:48,950
So, what you're dealing with, 
as an entrepreneur,

15
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:50,440
are these types of customers

16
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:53,476
that are much more educated 
than they used to be.

17
00:00:53,476 --> 00:00:55,781
They have multiple options; 
they can buy off-line,

18
00:00:55,781 --> 00:00:57,851
they can by online often times.

19
00:00:57,851 --> 00:01:03,208
So, in that sense, you are dealing 
with a subject out there that is,

20
00:01:04,058 --> 00:01:06,390
first, of vital importance to your 
firm's success.

21
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:11,331
But, on the other hand, also not
so easily graspable like it used to be.

22
00:01:11,331 --> 00:01:14,608
So in that sense, market research
and competitor analysis

23
00:01:15,018 --> 00:01:16,798
are of vital importance.

24
00:01:16,798 --> 00:01:20,688
Market Research should give you the
insights on a particular customer

25
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:24,291
and Competitor Analysis should give you
the insights on what the competition

26
00:01:24,291 --> 00:01:27,922
is doing to steal away 
that customer from you.

27
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:32,090
They have attractive offerings, so you
need to beat the competition away.

28
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:35,597
So, ultimately, what we are trying to do 
in this segment is to give you

29
00:01:35,597 --> 00:01:38,791
an understanding of which kind of 
information you're going to need

30
00:01:38,791 --> 00:01:42,488
to understand your customers solidly,
in a very thorough way,

31
00:01:42,488 --> 00:01:45,449
and which type of information you're going
to need to understand your competition,

32
00:01:45,449 --> 00:01:49,900
and how the competition tries 
to steal that customer from you.

33
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,380
So, lets start with looking 
at your customers.

34
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:54,811
From the entrepreneurial marketing
perspective,

35
00:01:54,811 --> 00:02:00,088
customer analysis is important 
for two main issues.

36
00:02:00,088 --> 00:02:02,478
First, for making sales.

37
00:02:03,178 --> 00:02:07,931
Meaning, you have to understand your
customers in order to fulfill their needs.

38
00:02:08,701 --> 00:02:12,033
In order to convince them 
to purchase your product.

39
00:02:12,033 --> 00:02:15,174
But beyond that-- and that is listed on
the second bullet point here,

40
00:02:15,714 --> 00:02:18,828
the question arises, "What do your
customers expect from your venture?"

41
00:02:18,828 --> 00:02:24,524
So, understanding customer needs also
has a venture dimension in the sense that

42
00:02:25,434 --> 00:02:27,792
the customers will be in touch 
with your venture.

43
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:32,737
And the customers will, 
for instance, need warranty.

44
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:34,811
They need to have a safe person.

45
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:37,151
They like to have contact 
with your venture.

46
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:42,343
And all of that, actually, shapes the
impression and their buying behavior.

47
00:02:42,343 --> 00:02:49,764
On the other hand, you have an important
dimension towards understanding customers.

48
00:02:49,764 --> 00:02:53,494
That is, customers should 
create value for your venture.

49
00:02:53,494 --> 00:02:56,604
That's beyond making sales, 
that's value creation.

50
00:02:56,814 --> 00:03:00,146
And, in order to understand how customers
create value for your venture,

51
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:03,508
there are a couple of questions to ask 
and two of the most important ones

52
00:03:03,508 --> 00:03:07,060
are listed here: "How much value do your
customers create for your firm?"

53
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:10,716
And "How should I invest my limited
resources"- including your attention,

54
00:03:10,716 --> 00:03:14,137
towards different types of customers 
so that I can actually

55
00:03:14,137 --> 00:03:16,136
create value for my venture?"

56
00:03:16,136 --> 00:03:19,162
So, why is it so important that you 
understand the specific needs

57
00:03:19,162 --> 00:03:21,006
of your target customers?

58
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:23,611
First, of course, you want to deliver 
value to them.

59
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:27,725
So in order to understand what type of 
functionality they need in a product

60
00:03:27,725 --> 00:03:30,908
you need to understand their needs.

61
00:03:30,908 --> 00:03:34,895
Second, you want to create 
an exceptional customer experience.

62
00:03:34,895 --> 00:03:38,787
It's not only an experience where the
customer purchases the good,

63
00:03:38,787 --> 00:03:43,719
but beyond that, he or she should feel
excited buying your product

64
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:46,239
and enjoying using it, 
because the greater the experience,

65
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,604
the more word of mouth they will create.

66
00:03:48,604 --> 00:03:51,708
And finally, of course, you want 
to beat your competition.

67
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,042
And by better understanding the needs of
your target customers,

68
00:03:54,042 --> 00:04:00,312
you will have a better angle towards 
that front that I've mentioned as well.

69
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:04,539
In order to understand your customers,
you can engage in a number of activities.

70
00:04:04,539 --> 00:04:08,745
I'll provide you with some 
easy guidelines, a three step process

71
00:04:08,745 --> 00:04:10,205
that will help you ask the right questions

72
00:04:10,205 --> 00:04:13,384
and note the right elements 
in this process.

73
00:04:13,384 --> 00:04:16,172
The first step would be interacting 
with your customers

74
00:04:16,172 --> 00:04:17,977
and trying on your customers' perspective.

75
00:04:17,977 --> 00:04:22,462
It's a vital step; it's a step where you
dive deeply into your customer

76
00:04:22,462 --> 00:04:29,070
and try to understand, "How does 
your customer look at your product?

77
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:32,630
How does she compare between 
alternative offerings?

78
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,816
How often will she purchase 
your product service?"

79
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,551
And you should also look at your 
customers' point of contact

80
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:39,587
with your future business.

81
00:04:39,587 --> 00:04:42,248
Do they shop online? 
Do they shop offline? Etc.

82
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:46,055
For the second step, you can then try 
to track the customers journey.

83
00:04:46,055 --> 00:04:48,070
And this is a bit challenging 
with a new firm

84
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:51,370
because many of the processes that 
the customers will experience

85
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:52,823
are not yet fully defined.

86
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:56,686
Some of them might exist, 
some might not exist.

87
00:04:56,686 --> 00:05:02,334
But note especially when their 
experience is breaking down,

88
00:05:02,334 --> 00:05:04,744
where the experience is strongest

89
00:05:04,744 --> 00:05:07,682
and note also where improvements 
can be made to that experience.

90
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,852
And, if you're in the venture design phase
still, you can say;

91
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:16,078
"Okay, what kind of cliffs would 
I experience as a customer

92
00:05:16,078 --> 00:05:18,226
when I would engage with my company?"

93
00:05:18,226 --> 00:05:23,263
And, in asking that type of question 
you can have very deep insights

94
00:05:23,263 --> 00:05:27,110
at this venture design phase 
about how to structure

95
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,465
your processes and relationships, 
and your point of contact

96
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:32,315
with your customers.

97
00:05:32,315 --> 00:05:34,059
The third point would then be to say,

98
00:05:34,059 --> 00:05:37,208
"Okay, I've gathered this 
type of information.

99
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:41,219
I've gathered the information from the
the interviews I did with my customers.

100
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:44,808
Now I can try to understand patterns in 
the behavior of your target customers."

101
00:05:44,808 --> 00:05:48,716
So, for instance, you can build 
a database of all your interactions

102
00:05:48,716 --> 00:05:49,706
with your customers.

103
00:05:49,706 --> 00:05:53,127
All the information you collected 
so that you have a good over view of

104
00:05:53,127 --> 00:05:55,432
what you have learned.

105
00:05:55,432 --> 00:05:57,600
And then engage in some meta-learning.

106
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,383
You can look at patterns in their
behavior and consider whether

107
00:06:00,383 --> 00:06:04,271
you have segmented the market 
in the best way possible.

108
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:07,468
And look out for ways to better 
meet their needs.

109
00:06:07,468 --> 00:06:10,429
Overall this is a learning process, 
you are engaging

110
00:06:10,429 --> 00:06:17,126
in a entrepreneurial venture 
that is often times launching inovation

111
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:20,778
which then means, well, of course 
I don't know everything in advance.

112
00:06:20,778 --> 00:06:24,363
And, customer learning is one of 
the most important learning processes

113
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:26,899
that you will face in your 
venture creation process,

114
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:28,959
so take this very seriously.

115
00:06:29,769 --> 00:06:33,121
In addition, you want to understand how
much value your customers are

116
00:06:33,121 --> 00:06:35,125
going to provide to your firm.

117
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,408
You can analyze your customers 
based on potential sales,

118
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:40,221
and thus understand how much 
revenue you may get

119
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:41,669
from a given group of customers

120
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:44,428
and this type of analysis will help 
you understand two things:

121
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:47,999
first, which customers are worth 
your efforts and expenses.

122
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:52,523
Not all customers are worth while
being catered to.

123
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:55,748
And this actually provides you with a 
second point here:

124
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:59,363
which customers could be better served
with lower cost approaches, for instance.

125
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:04,320
So, for instance, with customers that are
providing less value to your company,

126
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:08,110
you could say I engage with those 
customers only in digital ways,

127
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,204
with emails, with website interfaces

128
00:07:13,164 --> 00:07:16,172
and I could visit them less often, 
less frequently

129
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:21,147
if you're more in a business that is 
relying on direct customer contact.

130
00:07:21,837 --> 00:07:25,887
Give them fewer phone calls 
to remind them of a purchasing decision.

131
00:07:25,887 --> 00:07:29,068
So on the one hand, you are trying 
to understand your customers

132
00:07:29,068 --> 00:07:32,050
in order to be able 
to better cater to them.

133
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:34,682
And on the other hand, you're trying 
to understand your customers

134
00:07:34,682 --> 00:07:39,543
in order to create value for your venture,
meaning that, you're trying

135
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:41,607
to understand which type of customers 
that are actually

136
00:07:41,607 --> 00:07:44,735
producing that value for you
and which types of customers don't.

137
00:07:44,735 --> 00:07:47,370
The second key element that I want 
to discuss with you

138
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,576
in this segment is your competition.

139
00:07:49,576 --> 00:07:53,518
And there are two big questions that
are related to this larger topic.

140
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,352
Number one, who are your competitors
in the first place?

141
00:07:57,042 --> 00:07:59,969
This is often times not so evident,
especially if you are trying

142
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:01,908
to commercialize innovation.

143
00:08:01,908 --> 00:08:04,689
And second, what do you need to know
about your competitors?

144
00:08:06,579 --> 00:08:09,673
Once you know who they are, what
information do you need to gather

145
00:08:09,673 --> 00:08:14,248
about them to get a solid 
and well rounded understanding

146
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:17,399
of their activities and 
their potential future activities.

147
00:08:17,399 --> 00:08:18,967
So, the intended outcomes of this type

148
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:22,382
of analysis are straight forward,
I would say.

149
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:28,282
It's like first trying to understand 
what these other firms offer,

150
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:31,146
so that you can make your product
services and marketing stand out.

151
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:35,991
It will allow you to get an understanding
of the competitors' pricing,

152
00:08:35,991 --> 00:08:37,865
so set your prices competitively.

153
00:08:38,615 --> 00:08:45,234
It will help you to draw up and develop
marketing campaigns that might be

154
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:49,758
more appealing to your customers 
than those of the competition.

155
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:54,831
It helps you to access any threats 
posed by new entrace to your market

156
00:08:54,831 --> 00:08:56,434
and current competitors.

157
00:08:56,434 --> 00:09:00,449
And, ultimately, also helps you to
be realistic about how succesful

158
00:09:00,449 --> 00:09:01,741
you can be with your venture.

159
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:05,218
How much of the market space 
is already taken up by the competition?

160
00:09:05,218 --> 00:09:09,980
"Where do I have to fight hard
to overcome the competition?"

161
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:13,837
And this gives you a better understanding
also about your future growth potential.

162
00:09:13,837 --> 00:09:17,049
So a number of key benefits that are
through competitor analysis

163
00:09:17,049 --> 00:09:18,855
were rendered to your venture.

164
00:09:19,345 --> 00:09:22,941
Your analysis of the competition should
include your main competitors,

165
00:09:22,941 --> 00:09:25,497
and particularly, their strengths and 
weaknesses.

166
00:09:25,497 --> 00:09:29,501
So, look at their offering,
their prices, their distribution channels,

167
00:09:30,231 --> 00:09:34,637
their reputations, their marketing methods,
their brand and design values,

168
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:39,122
who actually owns the company, 
and what kind of person these people are.

169
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:41,579
Their strategies to build 
customer loyalty,

170
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:44,452
whether they innovate products 
and processes.

171
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:48,369
Their staff count and the caliber of
staff they can attract.

172
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,588
Their annual report 
if they are a public company,

173
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:53,259
and their media activities.

174
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,379
Do they have a website, and would they 
engage in local newspaper advertising,

175
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,965
radio and television, etc?

176
00:09:59,965 --> 00:10:02,789
And the more information you have about
your competitors, the better it is!

177
00:10:02,789 --> 00:10:07,368
Because it provides you with a more solid
ground for making your decisions about

178
00:10:07,848 --> 00:10:12,024
where your firm is going to compete, 
and how your firm is going to compete

179
00:10:12,024 --> 00:10:13,719
against these firms.

180
00:10:13,719 --> 00:10:16,107
So, often times entrepreneurs 
come to me and say,

181
00:10:16,107 --> 00:10:19,432
"Well, we do not have competition, 
we have such an innovative product

182
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:21,968
that does not yet exist 
in the market place."

183
00:10:22,418 --> 00:10:27,072
And I have to say; "Well, in that case 
you haven't done your job

184
00:10:27,072 --> 00:10:28,457
thoroughly enough."

185
00:10:28,457 --> 00:10:32,248
Try, really, to understand 
your customers and your competition.

186
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:37,295
Because, even if it's an innovation, there
are other substitute products out there

187
00:10:37,295 --> 00:10:41,926
that are catering to similar functional
needs of your customers.

188
00:10:42,566 --> 00:10:45,413
There are alternative products, 
and work-arounds that might exist.

189
00:10:46,153 --> 00:10:49,290
So, they're saying, "Well, we do not have
any competition"

190
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,016
often times is only an indicator 
that you haven't done

191
00:10:53,016 --> 00:10:54,706
your homework well enough.

192
00:10:54,706 --> 00:11:00,488
So, take this competitor analysis 
quite strongly and to the heart.

193
00:11:00,678 --> 00:11:04,845
And try to understand, "Well, this is an
opportunity for me to learn more

194
00:11:04,845 --> 00:11:07,272
about my company and my market place."

195
00:11:08,012 --> 00:11:11,716
What is particularly interesting is also
looking into your competitors' customer.

196
00:11:11,716 --> 00:11:15,036
Who they are, how they have
segmented the market,

197
00:11:15,036 --> 00:11:17,190
and what they sell to each segment.

198
00:11:17,190 --> 00:11:20,648
Your competitors' strengths and weaknesses
as perceived by their customers.

199
00:11:20,648 --> 00:11:24,301
Whether there are any long standing 
customers that they are catering to

200
00:11:24,301 --> 00:11:28,763
in which you might not be able
to win over immediately to your company.

201
00:11:28,763 --> 00:11:31,348
Unless you have a very, very compelling
value proposition.

202
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:34,137
And if they have had an influx of 
customers

203
00:11:34,137 --> 00:11:36,793
recently because this is an important 
indicator of whether,

204
00:11:36,793 --> 00:11:39,370
they have something very
attractive to offer to the market.

205
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:44,694
So, you can combined this on the one hand
with your customer interviews.

206
00:11:44,694 --> 00:11:47,677
You can understand very well 
by talking to customers.

207
00:11:47,677 --> 00:11:50,171
How they think and what they take into
consideration.

208
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:54,873
But you can also look at market reports
and other types of reports

209
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:56,218
to help make you understand

210
00:11:56,218 --> 00:12:00,208
"Well, how are the trends 
in my market evolving?" and

211
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:03,363
"Is my competition maybe 
offering something

212
00:12:03,363 --> 00:12:05,303
that's highly appealing to customers?"

213
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:09,370
This is vital information for the shaping
of your product

214
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:11,550
and for your marketing campaigns.

215
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,845
It ultimately comes down 
to three main insights.

216
00:12:14,845 --> 00:12:18,598
First, what can you learn from your
competition and do better?

217
00:12:18,878 --> 00:12:25,005
Second, what is my competition not doing
as well I am doing it? Or plan to do it?

218
00:12:25,545 --> 00:12:29,695
And, what are they doing 
equally as well then you are?

219
00:12:29,695 --> 00:12:33,757
So, if you look at all three elements--
these elements provide you with point on

220
00:12:33,757 --> 00:12:38,787
where to improve, also where you can
potentially beat your competition.

221
00:12:39,937 --> 00:12:41,279
Especially in the design phase, 
you can say,

222
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:44,799
"Well, I designed my company in a way, 
and my product in a way

223
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:49,168
that I attack my competitor 
from their weakest angle."

224
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:53,588
But keep in mind the customer still needs
to value the dimension

225
00:12:53,588 --> 00:12:56,619
of what you're trying to beat here.

226
00:12:57,269 --> 00:13:01,412
And, what are you doing equally well as
your competition, you can say,

227
00:13:01,412 --> 00:13:07,118
"Can I improve on that experience and make
it a differentiator of my business?"

228
00:13:07,118 --> 00:13:11,283
So that the customers will actually say,
"This is a great point that your company

229
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:14,364
is offering that I've never seen at any 
other competing firm.

230
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:16,680
So I am going to choose your product."

231
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:19,941
So in sum, what we have discussed in this
segment is actually--

232
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:22,732
it's pretty straight forward, 
but it actually means a lot of hard work.

233
00:13:23,092 --> 00:13:26,456
But I urge you to do this work, 
engage in this type of work

234
00:13:26,456 --> 00:13:30,503
because it presents you with 
the nuts and bolts of firm creation.

235
00:13:31,423 --> 00:13:35,677
Often times people say, "Well, your
business plan doesn't master

236
00:13:35,677 --> 00:13:38,199
and doesn't survive 
the first customer contact."

237
00:13:38,199 --> 00:13:41,895
But only if you've never spoken 
with a customer before.

238
00:13:41,895 --> 00:13:47,188
You have to understand what your customers
want and who your competitors are

239
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:50,918
in order to develop a compelling 
business plan and business concept.

240
00:13:50,918 --> 00:13:54,052
And this is exactly where 
this part comes in.

241
00:13:54,052 --> 00:13:55,968
Market research and competitor analysis.

242
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:59,908
So, we've looked in this segment at 
a couple of key steps

243
00:13:59,908 --> 00:14:03,167
that you can engage in order 
to understand your customers very well

244
00:14:03,167 --> 00:14:06,666
in order to understand 
your competitors very well.

245
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:11,740
Try them out, and I am curious 
to find out what you've learned.

246
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,001
Good luck!
