00:00:10,439 --> 00:00:13,195
Welcome back to our MOOC,
<i>Launching New Ventures</i>.

2
00:00:13,195 --> 00:00:15,477
This is Week 3
on entrepreneurial marketing.

3
00:00:15,487 --> 00:00:18,195
And this is a highly important week 
because in this week

4
00:00:18,195 --> 00:00:20,954
we are going to discuss 
how you are going to win customers

5
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:24,188
who will ultimately deliver the value
for your firm-creation process.

6
00:00:24,188 --> 00:00:26,569
So, when you think about
entrepreneurial marketing,

7
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,353
it's marketing for new ventures,

8
00:00:28,353 --> 00:00:30,467
and Peter Drucker said
something really nice

9
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:32,016
that I want to emphasize here.

10
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:35,324
He said, "The purpose of creating
a business is to create a customer,"

11
00:00:35,324 --> 00:00:36,474
and not a product.

12
00:00:38,214 --> 00:00:43,266
Marketing primarily is about establishing 
exchange relationships

13
00:00:43,266 --> 00:00:45,233
with a wide variety of stakeholders.

14
00:00:45,233 --> 00:00:49,525
So that could be in the labor market
where you need to hire people,

15
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:52,484
or in the capital markets,
where you need to raise money.

16
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:56,810
So part of your marketing can be oriented
toward these different stakeholders.

17
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:00,149
Plus, there could be
other stakeholders as well.

18
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:02,515
But in this MOOC,
in this segment in particular,

19
00:01:02,515 --> 00:01:04,662
we are going to talk about
the output markets.

20
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:07,626
How you market to your end customers
in order to achieve sales

21
00:01:07,626 --> 00:01:11,229
because this is a vitally important
function in your firm creation.

22
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:15,574
What is important to understand
is that entrepreneurial marketing

23
00:01:15,574 --> 00:01:17,522
is quite different from normal marketing.

24
00:01:17,522 --> 00:01:19,487
It means marketing at larger firms

25
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:21,251
because of a number of reasons,

26
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:24,302
and we have listed a couple
of these reasons on this slide here.

27
00:01:24,302 --> 00:01:26,563
One is, of course, you are a new company.

28
00:01:26,563 --> 00:01:29,627
And as a new company,
you do not have any track record,

29
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:33,042
people might not trust you,
you don't have any reputation,

30
00:01:33,042 --> 00:01:35,218
people don't know your product,

31
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:39,932
and you have to establish all
the exchange relationships from scratch.

32
00:01:39,932 --> 00:01:42,119
Right. Plus, there is
also the smallness issue.

33
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,288
If you are a small company,
you may have limited resources.

34
00:01:45,288 --> 00:01:48,351
I mean financial resources,
you don't have that many people,

35
00:01:48,351 --> 00:01:53,674
your skills, you are limited on time,
people don't know you,

36
00:01:53,674 --> 00:01:57,842
you have limited bargaining power,
a limited market power in general.

37
00:01:57,842 --> 00:02:03,299
- So, it's a relatively weak position--
- And that's further complicated actually

38
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,131
by market turbulence and uncertainty,

39
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:08,553
meaning lots of new entrants
coming into these markets,

40
00:02:08,553 --> 00:02:11,318
and your analysis
might have a short half-life.

41
00:02:11,318 --> 00:02:15,818
The market can change all the time,
and therefore, it is difficult

42
00:02:15,818 --> 00:02:19,171
for a small company to keep
on top of a rapidly changing market.

43
00:02:19,171 --> 00:02:22,200
So we want to give you some intuition
of what this really means.

44
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,561
And if you look at these examples here--
think about the Google Glass.

45
00:02:25,561 --> 00:02:27,692
Or think about the zero-blade technology,

46
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:31,388
this mobile wind turbine
that can do without having any blades.

47
00:02:31,388 --> 00:02:35,909
Right. There is also a vacuum-cleaner
that doubles as a piece of art

48
00:02:35,909 --> 00:02:37,701
for small apartments,

49
00:02:37,701 --> 00:02:43,491
and a flavor clock that releases different
smells at different times of the day

50
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:46,588
so you can tell by the sense
of smell what time it is.

51
00:02:46,588 --> 00:02:49,393
So, what do they have in common
if you try to market those?

52
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:55,670
Right. Essentially, most of these products
are difficult to understand at first.

53
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:59,418
People often have a reaction:
"What is this?!"

54
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,539
"What's going on with this?
I don't understand..."

55
00:03:02,539 --> 00:03:08,435
It's hard to fully interpret the product
the first time it hits the world.

56
00:03:08,435 --> 00:03:11,395
And if you are facing
these type of consumers,

57
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:15,426
they don't know which dimensions
are important in their buying decision,

58
00:03:15,426 --> 00:03:18,222
in the evaluation of the product.
You need to educate them.

59
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:23,362
They don't have any idea of what features
they prefer or don't prefer.

60
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:26,318
So that complicates the whole
selling process from your side

61
00:03:26,318 --> 00:03:28,901
and the buying process from their side.

62
00:03:28,901 --> 00:03:32,817
We are going to walk you through
a systematic process for understanding

63
00:03:32,817 --> 00:03:35,756
entrepreneurial marketing
and firm success.

64
00:03:35,756 --> 00:03:39,312
And that all starts with the fundamentals

65
00:03:39,312 --> 00:03:42,806
of the entrepreneur's distinctive
capabilities or competencies.

66
00:03:42,806 --> 00:03:46,660
In other words, what is the entrepreneur
really, really particularly good at?

67
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,024
Perhaps better than other people, in fact?

68
00:03:49,024 --> 00:03:52,493
And you probably remember
we discussed this exact topic last week,

69
00:03:52,493 --> 00:03:55,320
we tried to understand what is
your technological competence

70
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,320
and how that could be leveraged
into different market segments.

71
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:03,252
This week is actually building
on the insights we gained last week.

72
00:04:03,252 --> 00:04:06,678
Particularly in the strategy part
in marketing, you are going to decide

73
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:09,301
what are your specific target segments,

74
00:04:09,301 --> 00:04:12,469
and how should this particular
target segment perceive you;

75
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,385
i.e., how should your product,

76
00:04:14,385 --> 00:04:18,281
how should your company
be positioned vis-รก-vis that segment.

77
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:21,938
And that core strategic decision
will then be implemented

78
00:04:21,938 --> 00:04:24,813
through a variety
of marketing approaches, marketing tools

79
00:04:24,813 --> 00:04:29,301
like your distribution approach,
your pricing, your leaflets,

80
00:04:29,301 --> 00:04:31,666
your promotional activities, etc., etc.

81
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:37,529
This whole scheme
will then give you a very systematic,

82
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:39,351
orchestrated approach to marketing

83
00:04:39,351 --> 00:04:43,187
and that will help you to have a coherent,
clear message towards your customers.

84
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:48,196
So let's look at the set-up
of this week's MOOC in particular.

85
00:04:50,116 --> 00:04:54,278
We'll start with developing
a strategic marketing plan.

86
00:04:54,278 --> 00:05:00,008
Exactly. And that is then the basis for--
an ingredient of that, I should say,

87
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:03,585
is understanding your customers,
understanding your competitors,

88
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:07,155
because that type of knowledge is vital
to developing a good marketing plan.

89
00:05:07,155 --> 00:05:11,210
And then, we'll talk about
the customer value proposition,

90
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:17,156
in other words, what are you giving
to your customers, users, payers, etc.?

91
00:05:17,156 --> 00:05:18,915
What value are you bringing to them?

92
00:05:18,915 --> 00:05:21,533
We will then move into
the marketing implementation part

93
00:05:21,533 --> 00:05:23,483
where we'll talk about the marketing mix,

94
00:05:23,483 --> 00:05:26,492
and one particularly exciting element 
in the marketing mix,

95
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,828
which is the guerrilla marketing approach
that you might want to adopt.

96
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:32,218
It's a very creative approach
to marketing,

97
00:05:32,218 --> 00:05:37,801
it's a less resource-intensive approach
to marketing, which is vital

98
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:41,368
for young companies
which are typically cash-trapped.

99
00:05:41,368 --> 00:05:43,636
Right. And then,
we'll talk about crowdfunding.

100
00:05:43,636 --> 00:05:46,079
This won't be the only time
we discuss crowdfunding,

101
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:49,705
but in this particular module,

102
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:53,340
what we are going to do is discuss
the marketing aspects of crowdfunding,

103
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,374
and also help you prepare
for a crowdfunding platform

104
00:05:56,374 --> 00:05:59,698
that you'll be able to participate in 
later on in the course.

105
00:05:59,698 --> 00:06:02,370
And we'll conclude by talking about
market penetration,

106
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:04,910
that means you're going to want 
to see your products

107
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:07,374
being adopted by the market 
and generating

108
00:06:07,374 --> 00:06:10,750
the type of growth that you aspire to 
in your venture creation process.

109
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:14,560
So, we look forward to walking you through
all these exciting elements this week.

110
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,512
Thank you very much.

111
00:06:15,512 --> 00:06:16,922
- Stay tuned.
- Stay tuned!
