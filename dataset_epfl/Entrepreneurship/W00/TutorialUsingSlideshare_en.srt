1
00:00:04,209 --> 00:00:05,835
We are going to have you upload

2
00:00:05,836 --> 00:00:08,376
the URL of your SlideShare presentation

3
00:00:08,377 --> 00:00:12,334
into the Coursera assignment

4
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:15,447
to submit your business concept proposal.

5
00:00:15,448 --> 00:00:17,462
There will be more directions
on that later,

6
00:00:17,463 --> 00:00:19,206
so today we're just going to focus

7
00:00:19,207 --> 00:00:23,765
on using the SlideShare.net platform.

8
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:26,764
OK, so when we arrive at SlideShare.net,

9
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:28,611
we have a few options.

10
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,796
We see up at the top right

11
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:35,708
we can either upload a presentation
that has already been created

12
00:00:35,709 --> 00:00:41,082
in a program such as
Microsoft PowerPoint, Kingsoft,

13
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:44,500
the OpenOffice Impress programs,

14
00:00:44,503 --> 00:00:46,839
or any other kind of offline editor.

15
00:00:47,669 --> 00:00:50,062
There's many different types
of formats compatible.

16
00:00:50,506 --> 00:00:54,719
Or we can create our own presentation,

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,178
apparently it's going to be
a stunning presentation,

18
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,626
using the SlidShare.net technology
right on their platform.

19
00:01:03,046 --> 00:01:04,938
I really encourage you to,

20
00:01:04,938 --> 00:01:06,528
before deciding directly

21
00:01:06,529 --> 00:01:10,452
that you're just going to use the platform

22
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:12,932
with Haiku Deck on SlideShare,

23
00:01:12,933 --> 00:01:17,727
I would recommend that you go in
and explore the editor just a little bit.

24
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:20,804
You're going to see it,
we're going to cover a bit of that today,

25
00:01:20,805 --> 00:01:24,569
so you're going to see that there are
some pros and cons to each side.

26
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,982
We're going to first walk
through the option

27
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:29,463
of uploading your own file

28
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:32,446
that you have already created
in another editor.

29
00:01:33,036 --> 00:01:36,981
So if we click here, <i>upload</i>,
big orange <i>upload</i> button,

30
00:01:36,982 --> 00:01:39,238
we are going to come to this page.

31
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:42,515
Now, you can see I've circled <i>private</i>.

32
00:01:42,516 --> 00:01:44,192
You have two options here.

33
00:01:44,722 --> 00:01:49,407
You can either choose
to have your presentation public,

34
00:01:49,408 --> 00:01:52,552
to be indexed on SlideShare.net database,

35
00:01:52,553 --> 00:01:54,074
where others can find it.

36
00:01:54,075 --> 00:01:56,324
This could, of course,
help with your marketing.

37
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,606
However, if you want to keep
your new venture under wraps,

38
00:02:00,607 --> 00:02:03,775
you might want to select <i>private</i>,
and under this option,

39
00:02:04,155 --> 00:02:07,107
you automatically are going to be able
to see what you uploaded,

40
00:02:07,108 --> 00:02:10,734
as well as anyone to whom
you give your special secret link.

41
00:02:11,354 --> 00:02:14,210
So, moving forward,

42
00:02:14,211 --> 00:02:19,182
you can select many different
types of file formats to upload,

43
00:02:19,852 --> 00:02:23,197
including, as they advertise here,

44
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,655
<i>presentations, infographics,
documents</i>, and <i>videos.</i>

45
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:27,850
For this assignment,

46
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:30,655
we're going to ask you
to stick to a presentation.

47
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:34,534
PDF format is a great format to go with.

48
00:02:34,535 --> 00:02:39,614
It preserves all
of your different formatting

49
00:02:39,615 --> 00:02:44,318
for special fonts and other effects.

50
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,979
Now that we've clicked <i>upload</i>,
we come to this page.

51
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:56,041
You have here the opportunity
to edit the title of the document.

52
00:02:56,751 --> 00:03:00,157
And then you have to choose
some details,

53
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:02,125
such as the category.

54
00:03:02,126 --> 00:03:04,778
You need to write in a description here.

55
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,384
You can upload tags.

56
00:03:08,385 --> 00:03:11,061
Especially if you want
your presentation to be public,

57
00:03:11,062 --> 00:03:13,619
you're going to want
to select up some tags.

58
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:18,461
And, then of course, you have
the option here to stay private.

59
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:22,304
So, you can see in my example,

60
00:03:22,954 --> 00:03:24,669
I've already filled this in.

61
00:03:24,670 --> 00:03:28,501
So the name of my presentation
is <i>Introduction to VentureMOOC</i>.

62
00:03:28,502 --> 00:03:32,360
I just edited the title
right here, in this box.

63
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,381
I selected <i>education</i>.

64
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:39,414
Some other recommended categories
to choose would be

65
00:03:39,415 --> 00:03:42,058
the category of your industry

66
00:03:42,059 --> 00:03:43,815
where you have your new venture

67
00:03:43,816 --> 00:03:47,663
or equally, there is a small business
and entrepreneurship category

68
00:03:47,664 --> 00:03:49,266
that you could select.

69
00:03:49,806 --> 00:03:51,767
Education is also an option.

70
00:03:52,417 --> 00:03:55,792
So here I've written a small description

71
00:03:56,542 --> 00:03:57,858
of my presentation.

72
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:02,207
And you note, you have here
3,000 characters possible to use.

73
00:04:03,467 --> 00:04:07,295
Now, under tags, I've used relevant terms,

74
00:04:07,296 --> 00:04:11,168
such as <i>entrepreneurship, startup,
technology, strategy, and MOOC</i>.

75
00:04:11,598 --> 00:04:15,284
It's up to you to select which are best
for your own presentation.

76
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:19,553
I'm just going to now click
<i>save & continue</i>.

77
00:04:19,553 --> 00:04:24,417
And here we see our file
has been uploaded successfully.

78
00:04:25,167 --> 00:04:29,334
You can immediately click
to see it online.

79
00:04:29,778 --> 00:04:33,060
You can also see a preview
of the mobile version.

80
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,999
And, you can also embed.

81
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:42,646
If you want to put this
on your own website or a blog,

82
00:04:42,647 --> 00:04:44,319
you can use this.

83
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:48,082
Let's go ahead and see what it looks like.

84
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:51,917
What you don't see
on this screenshot is the URL bar.

85
00:04:51,936 --> 00:04:55,301
If you just want to go up
to the address at the top,

86
00:04:55,302 --> 00:04:57,384
you can copy and paste that link.

87
00:04:57,385 --> 00:04:58,657
It's going to be a link

88
00:04:58,658 --> 00:05:00,825
that always comes back
to your presentation.

89
00:05:00,826 --> 00:05:04,785
And it will be a link that you can use
to submit later on to Coursera,

90
00:05:05,185 --> 00:05:08,344
to submit this product
to be peer-assessed.

91
00:05:08,345 --> 00:05:11,033
Now we're going to talk
about creating content directly

92
00:05:11,034 --> 00:05:15,777
on the SlideShare.net platform
using the Haiku Deck editor.

93
00:05:16,217 --> 00:05:19,702
So, we're back now
to this original page we started at.

94
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:22,892
We've already seen the upload route.

95
00:05:22,893 --> 00:05:26,167
Now we're going to just go ahead
and click on the <i>magic wand</i>

96
00:05:26,168 --> 00:05:29,579
to start creating a stunning presentation,

97
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,059
as promised.

98
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,147
So the first thing
you're going to need to do

99
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:36,584
is <i>accept</i> the terms with Haiku Deck.

100
00:05:36,585 --> 00:05:39,882
And now you arrive to a slide
on which you have

101
00:05:39,883 --> 00:05:44,494
the first slide of your own presentation
editable and ready to go.

102
00:05:45,514 --> 00:05:48,204
It's good to note here, at the side,

103
00:05:48,205 --> 00:05:52,942
we have a sort of menu down
the left column,

104
00:05:55,657 --> 00:05:59,109
here we have the type of the slide.

105
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:02,130
So we have
various different types of text.

106
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:07,330
We have also place to select a photo.

107
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,835
You can upload directly here,
from <i>my pictures</i>,

108
00:06:12,836 --> 00:06:17,630
or you can equally type something
into the search box,

109
00:06:17,631 --> 00:06:19,527
and find photos online.

110
00:06:19,947 --> 00:06:22,642
You have here

111
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:29,083
two different options for the text,
either black or white text.

112
00:06:29,663 --> 00:06:31,268
So these are a bit limited.

113
00:06:31,768 --> 00:06:33,896
OK, now we have seen

114
00:06:33,897 --> 00:06:38,372
that we have here different ways
to insert a photo.

115
00:06:38,782 --> 00:06:42,954
And you have the options
to put your text into white or black.

116
00:06:43,624 --> 00:06:45,214
Very clean and simple.

117
00:06:46,054 --> 00:06:49,229
You're going to be able
to select a few different chart types.

118
00:06:50,139 --> 00:06:53,447
And also you can select
a solid color for the background.

119
00:06:55,337 --> 00:06:59,136
Here I've selected an amber-orange color.

120
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:05,413
And then we have at this
last menu item on the left,

121
00:07:05,414 --> 00:07:06,970
we have a layout.

122
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:13,333
So this layout is going to depend
on the type of slide that you chose

123
00:07:13,334 --> 00:07:17,709
way back at the beginning
under the <i>big T, little T</i>.

124
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,655
So you maybe,
if you selected a title slide,

125
00:07:21,656 --> 00:07:27,219
then here, you are limited
to just to two or three lines of text.

126
00:07:28,179 --> 00:07:33,362
Another fun thing
is that there are font themes

127
00:07:33,363 --> 00:07:36,444
available on the Haiku Deck platform,

128
00:07:36,445 --> 00:07:39,388
which means that if you just go up here,

129
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:43,173
and you pull down
that <i>font themes</i> icon there,

130
00:07:43,174 --> 00:07:47,097
you're going to be able to choose
a different type of font theme.

131
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:49,184
So I have chosen <i>Kalamazoo</i>.

132
00:07:49,185 --> 00:07:52,620
You can see that there is a color palette

133
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:54,966
that came up here on the left.

134
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:59,126
And also, I have now,

135
00:07:59,127 --> 00:08:02,195
the text on my slide has changed fonts.

136
00:08:02,945 --> 00:08:06,590
So here is a slide that I created,

137
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:10,477
just starting from that orange background.

138
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:13,541
With a little bit of manipulation,
we ended up with a title slide

139
00:08:13,542 --> 00:08:17,542
for Professor Marc Gruber's
paper titled, "Look Before You Leap."

140
00:08:17,897 --> 00:08:21,898
So, let me just show you how I got
to publish the presentation.

141
00:08:21,899 --> 00:08:26,717
Just go up here to the top right,
big, orange <i>publish</i> button,

142
00:08:26,718 --> 00:08:28,218
whenever you're ready.

143
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:31,805
And then, it just starts
to publish the presentation.

144
00:08:31,806 --> 00:08:34,706
It'll take just a second as it exports.

145
00:08:34,707 --> 00:08:37,999
And then you'll arrive at the page

146
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
where you see the <i>permalink</i>
to your presentation.

147
00:08:42,447 --> 00:08:46,371
And just like with the file

148
00:08:46,372 --> 00:08:49,327
that you uploaded and created
outside of SlideShare,

149
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:51,207
and uploaded yourself,

150
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:53,918
you'll just copy and paste
the URL the same way

151
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,718
in order to submit to Coursera.

152
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:59,394
Now, after having played around

153
00:08:59,395 --> 00:09:03,845
with the Haiku Deck editor a bit myself,

154
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,852
I have the following take on it.

155
00:09:06,853 --> 00:09:09,017
I would say it's a great tool

156
00:09:09,018 --> 00:09:11,956
if you have a very simple message
that you want to embellish.

157
00:09:11,957 --> 00:09:13,651
If you have…

158
00:09:15,311 --> 00:09:18,162
the desire to have
some more artistic freedom,

159
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:21,149
then you're probably going to want
to use an offline editor

160
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,243
with many, many options,

161
00:09:23,244 --> 00:09:28,846
and then just simply upload
to SlideShare, having saved it,

162
00:09:28,847 --> 00:09:32,775
or exported it,
or printed it as PDF document.

163
00:09:32,776 --> 00:09:36,184
So I hope that this tutorial
has been helpful for you

164
00:09:36,185 --> 00:09:39,722
to explore a bit the offerings
on SlideShare.net,

165
00:09:39,723 --> 00:09:42,323
and also to just have a quick look
through the process

166
00:09:42,324 --> 00:09:45,072
of how to get your content
on their platform.

167
00:09:45,762 --> 00:09:47,976
There's going to be
more tutorials coming up,

168
00:09:47,977 --> 00:09:52,451
on various topics, about submitting
your work for this course,

169
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:54,075
so stay tuned.

170
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:55,547
