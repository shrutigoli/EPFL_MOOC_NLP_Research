1
00:00:04,262 --> 00:00:06,794
Never thought that Marco Polo
would be such a nice guy.

2
00:00:06,994 --> 00:00:07,716
Yeah really.

3
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,782
Oh look who's there,
I think it's MOOC time again.

4
00:00:10,982 --> 00:00:12,604
Due to the popularity of the course,

5
00:00:12,812 --> 00:00:14,924
we thought it would be
a good idea to do a re-run.

6
00:00:15,124 --> 00:00:18,551
That's right this five weeks course
is gonna cover topics ranging from

7
00:00:18,751 --> 00:00:21,751
identifying and evaluating
business opportunities

8
00:00:21,951 --> 00:00:23,454
to entrepreneurial marketing.

9
00:00:23,654 --> 00:00:26,163
And we will also talk about raising
and managing money,

10
00:00:26,413 --> 00:00:29,499
value creation, value capture,
profiting from your innovation

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,105
and we also made a few changes.

12
00:00:31,305 --> 00:00:35,083
That's right! This year we're going
to move to a new on-demand model

13
00:00:35,283 --> 00:00:38,283
so you can watch the video lectures,
take the quizzes and exams

14
00:00:38,483 --> 00:00:40,476
all at your own pace,
whenever you like.

15
00:00:40,676 --> 00:00:43,676
And we will be including a new set
of videos from entrepreneurs

16
00:00:43,876 --> 00:00:46,876
That give you additional insights
on the topics covered in this course

17
00:00:47,076 --> 00:00:50,746
Plus, as an additional benefit,
we are again proud to offer

18
00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:55,693
2,500 dollars in seed funding for
the top 3 performers of this course.

19
00:00:55,893 --> 00:00:59,892
Join us from 16th of September 2016
for the new and improved MOOC

20
00:01:00,092 --> 00:01:01,640
"Launching New Ventures"

21
00:01:02,115 --> 00:01:06,658
Hey, speaking of new and improved,
I made some slight modifications

22
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:09,858
to the time machine that we wrote
at the end of last course

23
00:01:10,058 --> 00:01:11,440
-Oh really you did ?
-Yes, sir.

24
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,359
-That's exciting!
-Right over there...

25
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:22,845
