00:00:10,181 --> 00:00:11,808
Hello.

2
00:00:11,808 --> 00:00:14,920
- And welcome to our course--
- Launching New Ventures!

3
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:18,984
I'm Chris Tucci, Professor of 
Corporate Strategy and Innovation at EPFL

4
00:00:18,984 --> 00:00:20,947
and Dean of the College of Management.

5
00:00:20,947 --> 00:00:21,957
I'm Marc Gruber,

6
00:00:21,957 --> 00:00:24,477
Professor of Entrepreneurship 
and Technology Commercialization

7
00:00:24,477 --> 00:00:25,913
at the same institution.

8
00:00:25,913 --> 00:00:29,916
We both work for EPFL, 
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology

9
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,490
in Lausanne, Switzerland.

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,747
EPFL is a hotbed 
of entreprenuership and innovation.

11
00:00:34,974 --> 00:00:38,921
This enables us to study the creation
of high technology ventures,

12
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:41,978
and to work with the companies
to help them become more successful.

13
00:00:41,978 --> 00:00:46,396
In fact, at EPFL , two companies
each and every month get founded.

14
00:00:46,883 --> 00:00:49,279
Chris and I have designed
the course especially for you,

15
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:51,420
with the help of our wonderful assistants.

16
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,616
You will be seeing both of us
during the course,

17
00:00:54,117 --> 00:00:56,786
and you will be hearing directly
from a range of entrepreneurs

18
00:00:56,786 --> 00:00:59,254
that come from many, 
many nations across the globe.

19
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:04,005
The content for this course
draws on our experience in research

20
00:01:04,005 --> 00:01:05,576
of over 10,000 companies,

21
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:07,302
giving us a solid underpinning

22
00:01:07,302 --> 00:01:10,795
of any frameworks, tools, 
and tricks that we might discuss.

23
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,706
But, our advice isn't purely theoretical.

24
00:01:13,706 --> 00:01:16,796
It's also been applied
and tested with real people

25
00:01:16,796 --> 00:01:18,599
who've started successful companies.

26
00:01:18,599 --> 00:01:21,640
The course also builds on our experience
teaching Bachelor's, Masters,

27
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,319
and Executive Education classes
for more than a decade.

28
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:26,533
This is the first time
that we've been able

29
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:29,596
to combine all of this content
into a MOOC format,

30
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:32,831
and we are very excited
to share that content with you.

31
00:01:32,831 --> 00:01:37,169
And the course is full of jokes,
and we promise not to make it boring.

32
00:01:37,618 --> 00:01:40,994
- Who, us? Boring?
- No boring. (Laughter)

33
00:01:41,112 --> 00:01:44,575
This course is designed for people
who want to start a new venture,

34
00:01:44,575 --> 00:01:47,937
especially those interested
in a growth opportunity.

35
00:01:48,036 --> 00:01:50,120
What is important for us
is that you understand

36
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,145
the types of challenges and opportunities
faced by entrepreneurs,

37
00:01:53,145 --> 00:01:56,092
that you actually see the differences
between startup management

38
00:01:56,092 --> 00:01:58,324
and the management
in established companies.

39
00:01:58,802 --> 00:02:00,860
So, in this course, you will learn

40
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,503
how to identify and evaluate
business opportunities,

41
00:02:03,503 --> 00:02:05,752
how to creatively market your solutions,

42
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:07,242
how to raise funds,

43
00:02:07,242 --> 00:02:08,773
how to manage your funds,

44
00:02:08,773 --> 00:02:11,422
how to set up a compelling
crowdfunding campaign--

45
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:14,574
And how to profit economically
from your innovation.

46
00:02:14,881 --> 00:02:17,349
So, if you have a general interest 
In entrepreneurship,

47
00:02:17,349 --> 00:02:19,160
or maybe, toy with an idea already,

48
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,682
or you already embarked
on an entrepreneurial journey,

49
00:02:21,682 --> 00:02:23,425
this course is for you!

50
00:02:35,658 --> 00:02:37,973
We will test your progress
throughout this course

51
00:02:37,973 --> 00:02:40,748
with our quizzes,
and as a final assignment

52
00:02:40,748 --> 00:02:44,285
you will actually draft
your business concept proposal

53
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:46,431
and your crowdfunding campaign.

54
00:02:46,431 --> 00:02:48,351
And if that isn't interesting enough,

55
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:53,835
the top three performers in this course
will also be awarded 2,500 dollars.

56
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:57,245
And if that isn't enough, 
this course is entirely free.

57
00:02:57,372 --> 00:02:59,040
- Free?
- Free.

58
00:02:59,506 --> 00:03:02,093
So, if you are now excited
to join this course

59
00:03:02,093 --> 00:03:03,299
you can do so,

60
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:06,017
and we'll be happy to support you
on your entrepreneurial journey,

61
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,704
and you can sign up now.

62
00:03:10,005 --> 00:03:11,881
This was completely 
improvised in the end.

63
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:13,135
(laughing out loud)

64
00:03:13,135 --> 00:03:16,346
That was alright, actually.
That's OK.
