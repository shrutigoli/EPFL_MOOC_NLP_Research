1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:03,509
- Okay, welcome back! I'm Chris.
- And I'm Mark!

2
00:00:03,509 --> 00:00:05,815
We're going to answer 
some of your questions

3
00:00:05,815 --> 00:00:09,111
that you've been tweeting
and sending,

4
00:00:09,111 --> 00:00:10,577
and posting on the fora.

5
00:00:10,577 --> 00:00:13,522
We've made a big list 
of all the questions that we've received

6
00:00:13,522 --> 00:00:15,778
and we're going to get through 
as many as we possibly can

7
00:00:15,778 --> 00:00:17,346
in the next few minutes.

8
00:00:17,504 --> 00:00:20,826
Okay, so let's start with first one
which was post

9
00:00:21,468 --> 00:00:23,594
when we did Panel 3 on Funding,

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,118
The first question 
by Philippe in Paris.

11
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:28,299
Hi Philippe!

12
00:00:28,299 --> 00:00:30,426
Your question was: 
Crowdfunding platforms are numerous.

13
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:33,529
How should we choose between them
for our projects?

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:36,120
Which criteria should be taken 
into account?

15
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:39,790
Okay, so crowdfunding 
platform choice is important

16
00:00:40,566 --> 00:00:44,219
and we did discuss this 
in one of the sessions on <i>Crowdfunding</i>

17
00:00:45,318 --> 00:00:46,704
or actually in a couple 
of different sessions

18
00:00:46,704 --> 00:00:48,734
we touched on this issue.

19
00:00:48,734 --> 00:00:51,011
But basically the quick answer here

20
00:00:51,011 --> 00:00:55,804
is you need to take into consideration
the kind of crowdfunding it is,

21
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:57,567
the kind of thing you're looking for.

22
00:00:57,567 --> 00:00:59,681
Are you looking for gifts?

23
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:01,565
Are you looking for pre-selling inventory?

24
00:01:01,565 --> 00:01:05,013
Are you looking for donations?

25
00:01:05,715 --> 00:01:08,560
Loans? Low-interest rate allowance, etc.

26
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,613
and then you got to decide 
on the kind of platform,

27
00:01:12,613 --> 00:01:16,983
the kind of-- is it all or nothing funding?

28
00:01:16,983 --> 00:01:18,889
Or if it's <i>Take what you can get</i> funding?

29
00:01:18,939 --> 00:01:21,502
And you also have geographical 
and mission focus.

30
00:01:21,502 --> 00:01:23,628
There could be a geographical area
where it's certain,

31
00:01:23,628 --> 00:01:25,977
one, is you're really getting people
in that area,

32
00:01:26,084 --> 00:01:27,809
and then there's the mission focus

33
00:01:27,809 --> 00:01:31,524
which is about the specific topic.

34
00:01:31,524 --> 00:01:34,164
So all those things are all factors
you must take into consideration

35
00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:35,391
when choosing your platform.

36
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:38,925
I would even suggest
you surf a bit on the net

37
00:01:38,925 --> 00:01:41,121
and try to look at multiple platforms.

38
00:01:41,121 --> 00:01:41,958
Definitely

39
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:45,612
By doing so, you actually have 
a pretty good idea

40
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:48,707
of which type of platform 
will suit you needs best.

41
00:01:48,707 --> 00:01:51,456
It's like which type of platforms,

42
00:01:51,456 --> 00:01:53,577
or which type of movies 
that you see there,

43
00:01:53,577 --> 00:01:55,773
clips that you see there,
are actually appealing you

44
00:01:55,773 --> 00:01:58,124
and would most fit 
to your own venture.

45
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:00,274
- Yeah. Have a look at them.
- Have a look at them.

46
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:02,484
- They have their different personalities.
-Exactly.

47
00:02:02,553 --> 00:02:08,012
Okay. What expenses in manpower
does a good crowdfunding campaign require?

48
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:11,880
How many people should we recruit
for the process

49
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:14,380
and which skillset 
should they ideally have?

50
00:02:14,490 --> 00:02:16,484
That's all from Philippe in Paris.
(laughing)

51
00:02:16,484 --> 00:02:18,126
Quite interesting crowdfunding.

52
00:02:18,126 --> 00:02:21,935
The crowdfunding clip should be appealing

53
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:24,018
and it should transport the passion.

54
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,274
And we have seen research that shows that

55
00:02:25,274 --> 00:02:28,080
actually the passion 
that you get across on the camera

56
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,468
is something very vital

57
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:31,663
to getting other people
interested in your idea.

58
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:35,153
So if you think about this idea
that I just outlined,

59
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:36,766
how many people would you need?

60
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:40,172
It's should be you behind the camera,
like we're sitting here.

61
00:02:41,137 --> 00:02:43,095
- Cheap operation (laughs).
- Cheap operation.

62
00:02:43,893 --> 00:02:48,016
It doesn't have to be like 
a big Hollywood production.

63
00:02:48,016 --> 00:02:50,808
Quite the contrary,
that might offend some people

64
00:02:50,808 --> 00:02:52,608
because they say, "okay, we want..."

65
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:56,799
if you see an authentic person 
out there shooting this clip,

66
00:02:56,906 --> 00:02:59,818
and then being conservative
with the money,

67
00:02:59,818 --> 00:03:01,244
that sends a signal too.

68
00:03:01,244 --> 00:03:03,610
And also you don't want to spend--

69
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:05,346
The people on the crowdfunding platform,

70
00:03:05,346 --> 00:03:06,635
we are interested in your product

71
00:03:06,635 --> 00:03:08,104
and your company don't want to spend
their own money

72
00:03:08,171 --> 00:03:11,372
for you being 
in a luxurious Hollywood studio.

73
00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:13,894
They want to see that 
you're getting something out of the money.

74
00:03:15,435 --> 00:03:18,080
It's not so much about 
recruiting other people.

75
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:20,094
Right. I don't think
you need to recruit anybody for that--

76
00:03:20,094 --> 00:03:21,790
- Exactly.
- For that particular aspect of it.

77
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:25,135
Ask your friends to stand behind
the camera and do that.

78
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,842
What skills should they ideally have?

79
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:29,255
The sales skills.

80
00:03:29,255 --> 00:03:31,080
Try to be authentic on the camera.

81
00:03:31,191 --> 00:03:34,784
Try to have a nice storyline
in your crowdfunding clip

82
00:03:34,784 --> 00:03:36,545
to excite people,

83
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:39,513
and maybe practice a couple of 
variations with your friends

84
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:41,231
and see how they would react.

85
00:03:41,231 --> 00:03:43,053
- Nice.
- That was for Philippe.

86
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:45,502
And now we're going to Guatemala

87
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:46,795
just to the other side of the world.

88
00:03:46,795 --> 00:03:49,826
Why do some ventures that we can see
at Crowdfunding pages

89
00:03:49,826 --> 00:03:51,254
such as Kickstarter

90
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:54,270
look like a very bad idea
but still get what they ask for?

91
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,277
That is an interesting one.

92
00:03:55,277 --> 00:03:56,296
Christian asked that.

93
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:58,305
- Christian from Guatemala.
- Yeah.

94
00:03:58,435 --> 00:04:02,737
You know that's really interesting (laughs)
- Why do they get money?

95
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:04,142
Why do they get money?

96
00:04:04,142 --> 00:04:05,542
It's a bad idea (laughs)

97
00:04:05,653 --> 00:04:09,541
Well, I think it's a good idea to me
if they got money for itself.

98
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:12,819
They've convinced other people

99
00:04:12,985 --> 00:04:16,691
to actually dig deep into their pockets

100
00:04:16,717 --> 00:04:18,744
and give them some money.

101
00:04:18,949 --> 00:04:22,321
So it maybe that they are very good
in execution,

102
00:04:22,321 --> 00:04:24,243
they could be that
they have very good passion

103
00:04:24,243 --> 00:04:28,301
There lots of factors why people give.

104
00:04:28,837 --> 00:04:31,464
It could be that they think the person
got a very good business sense,

105
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:33,018
and would be responsible with the money

106
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:35,073
and can change later on

107
00:04:35,073 --> 00:04:37,578
if something else happens
that these ideas terrible.

108
00:04:37,578 --> 00:04:42,551
But in general I don't know--
A bad idea is a subjective thing.

109
00:04:43,303 --> 00:04:45,816
Being able to make money from it,
not everyone is going to agree.

110
00:04:45,877 --> 00:04:47,803
I think that's part of what they're
excitement about entrepreneurship.

111
00:04:47,864 --> 00:04:50,078
You know some ideas
could be appealing to a niche

112
00:04:50,078 --> 00:04:51,256
And you just don't understand

113
00:04:51,256 --> 00:04:53,533
why that niche ever finds 
this product interesting

114
00:04:53,546 --> 00:04:54,430
but they love this product

115
00:04:54,514 --> 00:04:55,462
- Right.
- It's a small niche

116
00:04:55,462 --> 00:04:58,064
and these people say 
"Finally, something's solves my needs".

117
00:04:58,158 --> 00:05:00,115
- Right.
- That's all.

118
00:05:00,223 --> 00:05:02,781
- You think about a rare disease--
- The cure. (laughs)

119
00:05:03,193 --> 00:05:05,480
You know cure for rare disease I mean,
most people say

120
00:05:05,529 --> 00:05:07,023
"look that's your relevant, that's stupid".

121
00:05:07,023 --> 00:05:09,324
- But people with the rare disease--
- They care a lot.

122
00:05:09,324 --> 00:05:11,335
They like it. Yeah. (laughs)

123
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:12,486
Okay.

124
00:05:12,486 --> 00:05:13,700
Next is another Philippe.

125
00:05:13,823 --> 00:05:15,682
This one is from Bordeaux France.

126
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:19,325
Could it be possible to reward
early "Crowdfunders"

127
00:05:19,325 --> 00:05:23,145
by giving them pre-stock-options,
which they could exercise?

128
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:25,194
And then someone else wrote the same,

129
00:05:25,293 --> 00:05:27,666
Is there any source
of financing mixing crowdfunding

130
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:31,233
with angel financing to approach people
not with gifts but with equity?

131
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:34,120
Will it be of any interest
if it doesn't exist yet?

132
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,582
I think here we discuss these a lot
in Week 4.

133
00:05:38,564 --> 00:05:42,257
And you know it depends on the country,
the platform etc.

134
00:05:42,257 --> 00:05:45,825
There's a lot of trickiness here
about giving away equity

135
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:47,379
in your crowdfunding campaign.

136
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:50,583
But it is possible in many countries
right now,

137
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:52,649
and it's getting more and more
possible over time.

138
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:56,317
So yes it is possible
to do crowdfunding camapaigns

139
00:05:56,317 --> 00:05:58,823
but it's not in every single country.

140
00:05:58,897 --> 00:06:01,991
Watch that little segment again
in Week 4

141
00:06:01,991 --> 00:06:06,359
and look up the rules
in your geographic locations.

142
00:06:06,819 --> 00:06:10,160
I just could to that its--
if you give up equity

143
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:13,045
that's quite an expensive way
of funding. (laughs)

144
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:15,699
So there might be other ways
lets say you give them product

145
00:06:15,699 --> 00:06:18,053
at a discount way actually make sale.

146
00:06:18,053 --> 00:06:21,541
So think about equity as one form
you can play with.

147
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,858
But they're others,
take others into consideration

148
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:29,016
and carefully list that pros and cons
before you go the equity route.

149
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:29,589
Yes.

150
00:06:29,589 --> 00:06:31,494
Then we have a question in French.

151
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:33,120
So I prefer to speak
in French now.

152
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:34,762
From Romer of France.

153
00:06:35,362 --> 00:06:39,780
(In French) <i>If we want to launch
a product in a market,</i>

154
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,489
<i>how do we know if our idea
is compelling</i>

155
00:06:42,489 --> 00:06:46,246
<i>without doing an expensive market study?</i>

156
00:06:46,418 --> 00:06:51,450
So the translation that is
If we want to launch a product

157
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:56,828
in a new market, how do we know
if our idea is compelling

158
00:06:56,828 --> 00:07:00,494
without doing an expensive market study?

159
00:07:00,494 --> 00:07:02,140
That it is my question.
- Yeah.

160
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,454
In French and in English (laughs)
- Exactly.

161
00:07:05,903 --> 00:07:07,475
How could we know that?

162
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:11,899
The point is you want to get 
a good idea

163
00:07:11,899 --> 00:07:13,911
about the target market 
you want to serve,

164
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:17,121
What does the target market
that you want to serve find appealing?

165
00:07:17,513 --> 00:07:22,268
With a lot of reflection
and desk research

166
00:07:22,268 --> 00:07:25,211
you can also figured out
which type of target market

167
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:28,839
could be the target market
you want to address.

168
00:07:28,938 --> 00:07:31,511
But it's ultimately you need to talk
with these people.

169
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:33,405
- Right.
- It doesn't have to cost a lot.

170
00:07:33,405 --> 00:07:34,232
I agree.

171
00:07:34,232 --> 00:07:35,491
But you have to make sure

172
00:07:35,491 --> 00:07:37,718
that you talk to the people
in your target market

173
00:07:37,718 --> 00:07:40,549
and then get their feedback
because their feedback is vital

174
00:07:40,617 --> 00:07:43,318
and then you're reflection meets--

175
00:07:43,318 --> 00:07:46,608
actually the experience
from the market and that typically

176
00:07:46,608 --> 00:07:49,787
or most often makes you think
about how to improve your product

177
00:07:49,787 --> 00:07:52,250
maybe re-positioning your product
to another target market.

178
00:07:52,431 --> 00:07:55,484
It doesn't have to cost a lot.

179
00:07:55,484 --> 00:08:01,458
You don't have to have like a big company
interviewing 500 people,

180
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,952
5,000 people for you
that's not the idea.

181
00:08:03,952 --> 00:08:05,169
It can be a few people

182
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:07,742
but think smartly about the questions
you want to ask them,

183
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:09,504
what you want to get 
out of these interviews

184
00:08:09,504 --> 00:08:10,763
and what do you want to learn.

185
00:08:10,763 --> 00:08:14,021
So that you improve the match
of your product to the market.

186
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:15,565
- Get out there and talk to people.
- Exactly.

187
00:08:15,788 --> 00:08:17,942
It's not gonna be that expensive
to do that.

188
00:08:18,119 --> 00:08:20,349
Follow them around,
see how they uses things like that.

189
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:21,704
Exactly.

190
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:26,328
Okay, let me ask another question
from Stephan Karlovac.

191
00:08:26,492 --> 00:08:29,825
Which is how big do you think
an impact on crowdfunding

192
00:08:29,825 --> 00:08:32,428
on small businesses in Switzerland is?

193
00:08:32,618 --> 00:08:35,904
Do you know some successful
business stories?

194
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:41,029
Okay, so that's a very detailed question
which I think refer as...look (laughs)

195
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:44,124
We're usually prepared here for this.

196
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,734
Like we looked at these questions
for the first time.

197
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,949
But in any case, 
we did look up a little bit.

198
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,209
As you know from Week 4,

199
00:08:52,209 --> 00:08:56,223
crowdfunding is a really growing rapidly.

200
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:59,396
It's 10 Billion Dollars in money

201
00:08:59,396 --> 00:09:02,466
was given to crowdfunding
platforms last year.

202
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:06,171
There are three relatively big ones

203
00:09:06,171 --> 00:09:09,256
and three smaller platforms 
in Switzerland right now,

204
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:11,074
which even that number is going up.

205
00:09:11,196 --> 00:09:15,538
The number that the amount is raising
within Switzerland is tricky to know

206
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:17,291
because people outside Switzerland

207
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:20,064
then go donate into platforms 
inside Switzerland

208
00:09:20,064 --> 00:09:23,869
and people inside Switzerland
donate platforms outside Switzerland.

209
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:27,737
So it's a tricky question to know 
the exact volume in Switzerland.

210
00:09:27,737 --> 00:09:31,787
By I did look up a couple success stories
including one called "Suit Art"

211
00:09:32,259 --> 00:09:33,937
which raised on a platform,

212
00:09:34,018 --> 00:09:36,309
a big platform in Switzerland 
called "See Crowd".

213
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:38,860
They raised the 500,050 Francs

214
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:41,860
which is roughly 600,000 Dollars or so.

215
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,649
And that enable them
to operate a franchise system

216
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:47,657
and expand to eight cities 
in Switzerland.

217
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:49,280
So they had a individual model

218
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,714
and then they crowdfunded 
to do an expansion

219
00:09:51,714 --> 00:09:54,084
and they got money
and then they did they're expansion.

220
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:55,560
So it's a tailor. it's a--

221
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,067
- Like suit.
- Making suits.

222
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:57,896
Yeah. Suite Art.

223
00:09:57,984 --> 00:09:58,815
So there you go,

224
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:01,089
there's an example 
of at least one small company.

225
00:10:01,229 --> 00:10:02,966
I had a feeling that's not the only one

226
00:10:02,966 --> 00:10:05,214
that was just very quick 
searching around for things like that.

227
00:10:05,307 --> 00:10:10,581
Okay, so we have a couple of questions
all related to the panel 4 that we did

228
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:14,246
out of fund raising 
and one question from Jay.

229
00:10:15,293 --> 00:10:17,491
- Sounds American or UK.
- Jay.

230
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,729
- it doesn't say where he's from.
- Where ever you are from.

231
00:10:19,729 --> 00:10:20,788
Here's your question.

232
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,881
How to raise finds for Non Tech Startup?

233
00:10:22,881 --> 00:10:26,931
Well it's a-- the question is more

234
00:10:27,008 --> 00:10:29,944
is it a growth story
that you'll looking at here?

235
00:10:29,944 --> 00:10:32,476
You know it could be a growth story,
it could be Non Tech.

236
00:10:32,534 --> 00:10:34,254
Often times the growth stories are Tech.

237
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,197
But the growth story could be non Tech.

238
00:10:36,197 --> 00:10:38,824
If it's growth story 
that is appealing

239
00:10:38,824 --> 00:10:41,702
and we talked about venture capital
and business angel in the MOOC,

240
00:10:41,702 --> 00:10:45,176
This could be your target audience
in the fund raising.

241
00:10:45,263 --> 00:10:46,371
If you have a growth.

242
00:10:46,449 --> 00:10:49,139
If you don't have a growth story
then the story is different.

243
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:51,903
Because then what would you do
with if you don't have a growth story?

244
00:10:52,230 --> 00:10:54,510
People would not want to invest for equity

245
00:10:54,510 --> 00:10:56,609
because the equity shares 
are not increasing

246
00:10:56,609 --> 00:10:59,687
- Anyway you might do crowdfunding.
- Anyway, you might like it.

247
00:10:59,687 --> 00:11:02,002
Crowdfunding.
You've got friends and family.

248
00:11:02,002 --> 00:11:02,802
Yeah.

249
00:11:02,802 --> 00:11:07,872
Maybe if you have 
some valuable stuff at home.

250
00:11:08,013 --> 00:11:09,980
Maybe even your house
that you put mortgage

251
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:11,741
you can get bank loans,
and all sorts.

252
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:13,604
Its the typical, debt financing.

253
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,836
Speaking of Debt Financing
we had a couple questions on that one

254
00:11:16,836 --> 00:11:18,232
from Glen in Lausanne,

255
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:20,533
and then one from Lucas 
in Los Angeles.

256
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,508
What options exist for debt financing?

257
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:28,890
And what chances there 
are the bank lending a startup money?

258
00:11:30,053 --> 00:11:34,261
Okay, you're right in a sense

259
00:11:34,313 --> 00:11:37,547
that banks in the MOOC in Week 4

260
00:11:37,547 --> 00:11:40,320
we talked a lot banks and debt financing.

261
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:44,591
However, much less used,

262
00:11:45,089 --> 00:11:47,674
it is possible for firms to issue debt,

263
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:49,558
to issue their own bonds.

264
00:11:49,713 --> 00:11:51,719
That would be another option

265
00:11:51,719 --> 00:11:54,999
but I would say for startup company
in general,

266
00:11:54,999 --> 00:11:58,068
debt financing is going to be
relatively difficult.

267
00:11:58,173 --> 00:12:00,921
Especially non-collateralized
debt financing.

268
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,747
While a big corporation 
can issue a bond,

269
00:12:05,401 --> 00:12:08,825
small companies are going to have
a very difficult time to do that

270
00:12:08,825 --> 00:12:11,610
and going to a bank
is really the only option

271
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:13,925
and then the question
will banks lend to startups?

272
00:12:13,925 --> 00:12:16,657
And the answer is very limited.

273
00:12:16,657 --> 00:12:18,497
You have a checking maybe
or you can--

274
00:12:18,497 --> 00:12:20,561
High interest rate,
highly collateralized.

275
00:12:20,604 --> 00:12:24,442
Some startup use multiple credit cards
that they pushed to the max.

276
00:12:24,504 --> 00:12:26,423
Then you get huge interests on that.

277
00:12:26,469 --> 00:12:28,979
but still it's not the typical way.

278
00:12:28,979 --> 00:12:30,712
Those are debts,
those are all debt financing.

279
00:12:30,712 --> 00:12:32,227
-Exactly.
- So those are examples.

280
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:35,963
But it's not super common
I would say in that point of view.

281
00:12:36,741 --> 00:12:38,829
Almira from San Francisco.

282
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:42,844
What to do if the management team
doesn't have a lot experience?

283
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,446
Yeah, how tricky.

284
00:12:45,408 --> 00:12:46,638
Very good question.

285
00:12:47,271 --> 00:12:51,246
You definitely want to expand
your management team,

286
00:12:51,246 --> 00:12:52,462
you know over time,

287
00:12:52,553 --> 00:12:55,411
and you do want search
for complimentary skills.

288
00:12:55,952 --> 00:12:59,423
However, I think you also have
to be very careful with making sure

289
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:02,297
that you have a kind of a personality match

290
00:13:02,398 --> 00:13:07,125
and kind of a vision match
so that you can work together carefully

291
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:10,584
and maybe even be more important
than the skills.

292
00:13:10,584 --> 00:13:11,716
The skills, I mean,

293
00:13:11,716 --> 00:13:13,815
somebody might be able to learn
complementary skills

294
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:16,254
or maybe branch out a little bit
from where they are,

295
00:13:16,254 --> 00:13:19,348
but it's really hard if you have 
an ethical problem with somebody.

296
00:13:20,225 --> 00:13:22,386
Like you're not sure 
if the person is a crook or not

297
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:26,240
to have them learn to be a good person
is probably less likely.

298
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,754
- Yes.
- So I would say --

299
00:13:28,336 --> 00:13:32,054
So that's why I would say
that in general, you want to--

300
00:13:32,054 --> 00:13:33,758
- Make sure that you get along.
- Make sure you get along.

301
00:13:33,758 --> 00:13:35,802
And you have kind of advisers--

302
00:13:35,802 --> 00:13:38,019
In many countries, 
there will be consultants.

303
00:13:38,019 --> 00:13:40,730
For instance in Switzerland,
the State,

304
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,426
the government has funds
that pay for consultants for start-ups.

305
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:47,217
They help to fill-in the gaps 
in knowledge.

306
00:13:48,017 --> 00:13:50,235
I think be honest with--

307
00:13:50,235 --> 00:13:52,142
I like your question
because it means you are:

308
00:13:52,142 --> 00:13:56,498
"I'm honest with my skills.
I'm honest with my lacking skills."

309
00:13:56,498 --> 00:13:59,259
Because most entrepreneurs 
often fool themselves

310
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:01,802
and trick themselves for saying,
"Well, we have all the skills,"

311
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:05,335
and then after time, they realize
they lack the skills.

312
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:07,659
Then it's too late 
because they made errors

313
00:14:07,659 --> 00:14:11,198
on the course of venture creation.

314
00:14:11,676 --> 00:14:14,324
In short, be honest to yourself,

315
00:14:14,324 --> 00:14:17,016
try to understand which skills you lack,

316
00:14:17,016 --> 00:14:19,080
which skills are lacking in your team,

317
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:22,978
and if you want to raise funds
for a venture capitalist, be honest too

318
00:14:22,978 --> 00:14:24,087
because they will find out

319
00:14:24,087 --> 00:14:26,275
that these skills are lacking
from your team.

320
00:14:26,275 --> 00:14:29,560
Sometimes investors 
will also suggest people they can trust.

321
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,256
Exactly. Some have an HR function
in the venture caps,

322
00:14:32,256 --> 00:14:35,099
some of the venture capitalists
And they will help you fill in the slots

323
00:14:35,182 --> 00:14:37,271
because they know lots of people.

324
00:14:37,484 --> 00:14:38,739
- So where are we?
- For the last one...

325
00:14:38,871 --> 00:14:41,944
Besides a strong business plan
and good financials,

326
00:14:41,944 --> 00:14:45,278
what are the soft skills required
to convince investors?

327
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:47,559
This one may also be 
from Almira in San Francisco.

328
00:14:47,648 --> 00:14:50,339
So if you think about the soft skills,

329
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,614
it's how the team works together.

330
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:53,891
It's one important soft skill.

331
00:14:53,891 --> 00:14:57,569
Like when there are critical questions
for instance,

332
00:14:57,569 --> 00:14:59,109
an investor pitch.

333
00:14:59,109 --> 00:15:01,714
How does the team handle those questions.

334
00:15:01,714 --> 00:15:03,363
How does the team react?

335
00:15:03,363 --> 00:15:05,228
Do they react as a team

336
00:15:05,264 --> 00:15:06,859
or is it like five people, 
three people

337
00:15:06,859 --> 00:15:09,773
who are like one man show,
one woman show.

338
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:13,646
Try to be a team working
in a cohesive manner.

339
00:15:13,646 --> 00:15:17,368
The soft skills can also be sensitive
to customer feedback,

340
00:15:17,368 --> 00:15:22,021
sensitive towards the feedback you see
from all kinds of stakeholders.

341
00:15:24,279 --> 00:15:26,358
What other soft skills could be there?

342
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:30,080
I think some of the main ones
it's certainly some leadership skills.

343
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:30,910
- Right.

344
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:34,139
If you have employees, 
it's a matter of motivating them

345
00:15:34,139 --> 00:15:35,377
because you have to figure out

346
00:15:35,377 --> 00:15:38,368
or realize that these people
also take risks

347
00:15:38,368 --> 00:15:39,476
by working in startups.

348
00:15:39,476 --> 00:15:43,880
The startup might not be alive
in a few years, a few months even.

349
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:49,334
So they take some risks
and be sensitive to their needs too.

350
00:15:49,334 --> 00:15:51,854
- They need some --
- Have people skills.

351
00:15:51,854 --> 00:15:53,761
Presentation skills in general,

352
00:15:53,761 --> 00:15:56,507
interacting with people,
potential investors, etc.

353
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:59,522
It's good to have that down.

354
00:15:59,978 --> 00:16:02,092
I think another question from Almira.

355
00:16:02,092 --> 00:16:04,465
You ask lots of questions
which is great by the way.

356
00:16:04,465 --> 00:16:07,034
Or maybe from someone else,
we don't have a name here.

357
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:10,846
How important is it to think about budget
during the planning phase?

358
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:15,034
I think it's- of course, I mean, 
if money is no object,

359
00:16:15,034 --> 00:16:16,837
then it's not important 
to think about budget.

360
00:16:18,315 --> 00:16:21,136
But if you are in any way 
constrained by money,

361
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:24,901
then you really have to start thinking
about this straight away.

362
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:27,425
- So that means--
- Which is the case with most ventures.

363
00:16:27,425 --> 00:16:29,987
Yeah. I mean you think about 
the cash position that you're in.

364
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:33,871
We've talked about this 
ad nauseam I think in Week 4.

365
00:16:35,046 --> 00:16:37,694
- But you got to decide --
- Go and watch Week 4 again!

366
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:40,704
You know how long do you have
before you run out of cash.

367
00:16:40,796 --> 00:16:42,384
Maybe they wrote the question
before they watched the week.

368
00:16:42,483 --> 00:16:43,926
- It could be.
- And that you'll regret that day.

369
00:16:43,926 --> 00:16:47,285
You have to know how long you have
before you run out of cash.

370
00:16:47,285 --> 00:16:49,277
I think that's the budgeting aspect.

371
00:16:49,277 --> 00:16:50,892
I mean, it doesn't have to be 
this detailed thing,

372
00:16:50,892 --> 00:16:52,971
you're looking at every single last detail.

373
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:55,107
But if you can gross up your costs

374
00:16:55,107 --> 00:16:56,888
and you can take a look 
at your cash position,

375
00:16:56,888 --> 00:17:00,413
and you can figure out 
your burn rate, as we discussed,

376
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:02,875
then I think there 
is where you need to do it.

377
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:07,660
And I don't think that you need to go down
to the level of specific categories

378
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,349
and then an accounting software package.

379
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:12,394
You really need to think about
where your gross costs are coming from.

380
00:17:12,394 --> 00:17:16,238
That's where the budgeting comes in.
I think that's pretty important.

381
00:17:16,797 --> 00:17:17,945
Another Philipe.

382
00:17:17,945 --> 00:17:20,165
Okay, this is from Philipe 
in Bordeaux.

383
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:24,256
According to your experience
or intuition,

384
00:17:24,256 --> 00:17:28,248
what could be a key element
to scale up a business

385
00:17:28,248 --> 00:17:33,327
usually run on a service model,
like consulting or coaching?

386
00:17:33,327 --> 00:17:37,278
avoiding a slow growth
and only by hiring more and more people?

387
00:17:37,396 --> 00:17:38,764
What tools or what approach?

388
00:17:38,764 --> 00:17:40,227
Please feel free to share your insights,

389
00:17:40,227 --> 00:17:42,263
especially the none obvious ones.

390
00:17:42,352 --> 00:17:43,611
(laughing)

391
00:17:43,611 --> 00:17:45,996
- Yeah, that's a tall order.
- Only non-obvious ones!

392
00:17:45,996 --> 00:17:47,813
You are setting the bar high

393
00:17:47,813 --> 00:17:50,220
in terms of our capability 
to answer questions here.

394
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:52,742
I think your question is right to the point

395
00:17:52,742 --> 00:17:55,905
because we talked about scalabiity
in one of the weeks.

396
00:17:55,905 --> 00:18:00,285
And a human capital driven model means

397
00:18:00,285 --> 00:18:03,388
well you have to add new people
to be able to grow.

398
00:18:03,388 --> 00:18:05,845
And while if you have 
a more product-driven model,

399
00:18:05,955 --> 00:18:07,631
like you do maybe on the internet,

400
00:18:07,631 --> 00:18:10,570
you just add another server
and you cater to a million more people.

401
00:18:11,147 --> 00:18:15,221
These are different scales,
scalability issues,

402
00:18:15,221 --> 00:18:16,984
challenges that we face here.

403
00:18:16,984 --> 00:18:19,027
But for the human capital driven model,

404
00:18:19,027 --> 00:18:23,816
it's either you can think about
creating--

405
00:18:23,816 --> 00:18:27,148
putting some of your offering
to a product offering.

406
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:28,082
- To a back-end.

407
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:30,341
You're moving, 
packaging it somehow differently.

408
00:18:30,341 --> 00:18:32,934
That might be 
thinking out of the box

409
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:35,030
and you could be the first one
in your industry who does this.

410
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,241
- Yeah.
- Which is fine.

411
00:18:36,241 --> 00:18:37,625
There's always pioneers
who are needed.

412
00:18:37,766 --> 00:18:40,396
Or you might think about ways
to scale up

413
00:18:40,396 --> 00:18:42,261
your human capital-driven model

414
00:18:42,261 --> 00:18:43,832
by saying we do franchising?

415
00:18:43,832 --> 00:18:47,107
Think about the <i>audience immobilier</i>

416
00:18:47,172 --> 00:18:50,455
or the realtor... what that..?

417
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:52,326
- Yeah, real estate.
- Real estate agencies.

418
00:18:52,326 --> 00:18:54,871
What they do now
in order to be able to grow,

419
00:18:54,871 --> 00:18:56,631
they say we'll do a franchise model

420
00:18:56,631 --> 00:18:59,827
and we are using that model
across the country.

421
00:18:59,827 --> 00:19:00,911
And also in that sense,

422
00:19:00,911 --> 00:19:05,704
try to think of ways that other people
will have to have the hiring problems,

423
00:19:05,704 --> 00:19:06,952
management problems,

424
00:19:06,952 --> 00:19:10,425
and you are copying in a way
your system.

425
00:19:10,425 --> 00:19:12,882
That's another way of growing.

426
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:15,091
- Any other ideas?
- They also automate.

427
00:19:15,091 --> 00:19:18,807
I mean if you go and look 
to rent an apartment

428
00:19:18,807 --> 00:19:22,623
then you're on a website,
and then that's backend.

429
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:24,474
They're not a person showing you around.

430
00:19:24,474 --> 00:19:27,651
So real estate agencies in fact
have migrated a little bit

431
00:19:27,651 --> 00:19:31,963
from the real, person-to-person,
low-scale businesses,

432
00:19:31,963 --> 00:19:35,588
to some combination
of high touch person-to-person

433
00:19:35,588 --> 00:19:37,992
and low-touch which is like a backend.

434
00:19:37,992 --> 00:19:40,208
So there, you're searching on the backend,

435
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:41,962
and you're trying to narrow down
to maybe four of five,

436
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:43,124
and then you contact the person,

437
00:19:43,124 --> 00:19:44,875
then the person shows you an apartment.

438
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,672
You may be able to do something like that,

439
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:48,490
a consulting type
or a coaching business.

440
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,591
Maybe there's a backend thing 
that you can do that's automated

441
00:19:51,591 --> 00:19:53,242
that reaches more people

442
00:19:53,242 --> 00:19:56,416
and then you can come in
and give specific pointers

443
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:58,028
with on a person-to-person level.

444
00:19:58,028 --> 00:20:01,698
- That was definitely not an obvious one.
- Okay. That's not an obvious.

445
00:20:01,698 --> 00:20:03,554
I don't think that's obvious at all.

446
00:20:03,554 --> 00:20:06,444
The next two questions come from France.

447
00:20:06,444 --> 00:20:09,464
Two from Abdiram and Antoinne

448
00:20:09,464 --> 00:20:11,158
Yuganne from Boulogne,

449
00:20:11,292 --> 00:20:12,911
and the first one was from Paris.

450
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,698
They've asked the same question.

451
00:20:14,698 --> 00:20:18,535
Is it possible to raise money
when you don't have any customers?

452
00:20:18,913 --> 00:20:22,877
It's possible to raise money
even when there's no customers.

453
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:25,930
The problem is

454
00:20:25,987 --> 00:20:29,977
you are going to be giving up more 
of your company to get money

455
00:20:30,052 --> 00:20:31,539
when you have no customers.

456
00:20:31,539 --> 00:20:33,323
- Exactly.
- High risk situation.

457
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:37,965
High risk means higher potential reward
for the investor.

458
00:20:37,965 --> 00:20:40,347
Put yourself in the investor's shoes.

459
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:45,288
if there's no proof of market,
would you invest in that?

460
00:20:45,288 --> 00:20:47,048
There's some investor that will say,

461
00:20:47,048 --> 00:20:49,336
"Well, we are joining 
the ticket as Business Angels

462
00:20:49,336 --> 00:20:52,306
and we're developing the prototype
and help you get the customers."

463
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,181
But that comes at a price.

464
00:20:54,181 --> 00:20:56,028
But it's not impossible.

465
00:20:56,028 --> 00:20:58,398
Quite to the contrary,
think about ways of maybe

466
00:20:58,398 --> 00:21:01,471
even your potential first customers
can help you find

467
00:21:01,471 --> 00:21:03,257
if they have a high need for that product.

468
00:21:03,257 --> 00:21:05,948
There are lots of examples 
like that out there.

469
00:21:08,038 --> 00:21:10,170
- Great.
- Jay from San Juan.

470
00:21:10,285 --> 00:21:12,838
What problems are associated 
with raising too much money?

471
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,698
(laughter)

472
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,102
That's a good problem to have.

473
00:21:17,148 --> 00:21:18,822
That's a very good problem to have.

474
00:21:18,822 --> 00:21:21,488
Well, you have to be diligent 
with your funds

475
00:21:21,488 --> 00:21:23,105
and you should not waste that.

476
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:25,046
You might be tempted to waste your money

477
00:21:25,046 --> 00:21:26,983
if you raised too much money.

478
00:21:26,983 --> 00:21:28,594
if you're disciplined,

479
00:21:28,594 --> 00:21:31,079
then there's really, 
almost never a problem

480
00:21:31,079 --> 00:21:32,672
with raising too much money.

481
00:21:32,672 --> 00:21:38,293
But if you're throwing lavish parties
with the funds--

482
00:21:38,293 --> 00:21:40,601
Then, this will backfire.

483
00:21:40,678 --> 00:21:42,293
--then maybe it's not so great.

484
00:21:42,293 --> 00:21:45,498
So you end up wasting your money
and it's not so great.

485
00:21:45,498 --> 00:21:48,241
And if you think about
having too much money,

486
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:51,095
this buys you time 
until your next financing rounds.

487
00:21:51,095 --> 00:21:54,045
So be happy about it
because you don't have to think about

488
00:21:54,045 --> 00:21:56,137
getting additional finances.

489
00:21:56,137 --> 00:21:58,679
For some, more time, you know,
so for a little while.

490
00:21:59,894 --> 00:22:01,406
Farras from Tyrone.

491
00:22:01,547 --> 00:22:05,394
How can we start a startup
with profits from the beginning?

492
00:22:05,394 --> 00:22:06,682
Okay that's a nice.

493
00:22:06,776 --> 00:22:08,123
One of the best business

494
00:22:08,123 --> 00:22:09,928
is when money just comes into Paypal

495
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:12,908
or the check comes into the mail

496
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:14,745
and you just go about 
your daily activities

497
00:22:14,745 --> 00:22:16,375
to how much money arrived.

498
00:22:16,481 --> 00:22:18,745
I mean, if you don't have 
an initial cash position

499
00:22:18,745 --> 00:22:22,044
it's really hard to start.

500
00:22:23,077 --> 00:22:27,038
Because you're going to have some costs
that you're going to invest in

501
00:22:27,177 --> 00:22:30,453
to get your first product,
or service, or whatever.

502
00:22:30,453 --> 00:22:33,906
It could be that you have 
a pot of money to start with

503
00:22:33,906 --> 00:22:35,383
then spend a little bit of that

504
00:22:35,383 --> 00:22:38,324
and you immediately generate 
some revenues.

505
00:22:39,463 --> 00:22:42,466
It has to be a low capital
intensive business.

506
00:22:43,005 --> 00:22:44,508
So you already own a computer

507
00:22:44,508 --> 00:22:46,240
and you can use it to program something,

508
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,291
and you can make a phone app
or something like that

509
00:22:48,291 --> 00:22:50,060
that people want to pay for,

510
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,012
then yeah, I mean it's doable.

511
00:22:54,110 --> 00:22:58,014
But even then, you're going to spend
some amount of money at some time,

512
00:22:58,032 --> 00:23:01,661
unless you say it's
'I already own the equipment.

513
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:04,310
It's fine. I'm not spending anything
out of my own pocket right now.'

514
00:23:04,310 --> 00:23:06,675
It's kind of the boot-strapping idea

515
00:23:06,675 --> 00:23:08,080
which i think is a good one.

516
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,621
If you can do it, It's always great.

517
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:12,565
It's just that usually,
you require more capital

518
00:23:12,565 --> 00:23:14,652
because you have to pay people,
you have to pay for services,

519
00:23:14,652 --> 00:23:16,273
you have to buy some more equipment,

520
00:23:16,281 --> 00:23:18,659
and you have to spend 
a little bit of money at the beginning

521
00:23:18,659 --> 00:23:21,642
so it's harder to just come out
straight out of the gate,

522
00:23:21,642 --> 00:23:24,687
profitable from the very beginning.

523
00:23:25,012 --> 00:23:26,667
Then you can look it
from the customer side.

524
00:23:26,667 --> 00:23:29,023
They will buy your product
if you have some kind of advantage,

525
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:30,887
vis-a-vis, the existing product.

526
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:36,021
And this advantage needs to be generated
somehow upfront.

527
00:23:36,577 --> 00:23:38,800
So it's like you have to do 
some investment.

528
00:23:39,012 --> 00:23:41,015
The question is how much investment
do you have to do

529
00:23:41,015 --> 00:23:42,664
based on the occuring status.

530
00:23:42,664 --> 00:23:44,999
How far or how long are you already?

531
00:23:44,999 --> 00:23:49,666
So from that perspective
it's tricky.

532
00:23:49,666 --> 00:23:54,199
I think it's really--unless 
you have invested a lot in the past.

533
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:56,597
You already paid for the equipment.

534
00:23:57,114 --> 00:23:58,735
A software, or something like that.

535
00:23:58,735 --> 00:24:01,990
You're not going to start a car company
and be profitable from the Day 1.

536
00:24:02,748 --> 00:24:04,169
A pharmaceutical company,

537
00:24:04,169 --> 00:24:06,457
there's just- that was just too capital.

538
00:24:06,457 --> 00:24:08,999
- Exactly. Maybe some human capital.
- Maybe if you're lucky in software.

539
00:24:08,999 --> 00:24:10,737
And service businesses way,
you can say,

540
00:24:10,737 --> 00:24:13,367
well I do grocery shopping
for elderly ladies,

541
00:24:13,367 --> 00:24:15,744
and you can do this 
with your current skill set.

542
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:18,668
All of you have to do 
is talk to elderly ladies on the street

543
00:24:18,668 --> 00:24:20,424
or while they cross the street.

544
00:24:20,424 --> 00:24:22,609
Right. I guess that's true,
you can walk with them,

545
00:24:22,609 --> 00:24:26,576
but if you buy a car, you know,
then you're okay...(laughing)

546
00:24:26,576 --> 00:24:27,951
Alright, let's move on.

547
00:24:27,951 --> 00:24:30,064
What are the typical elements
to keep in mind

548
00:24:30,064 --> 00:24:32,493
in order to generate trust in the project?

549
00:24:32,493 --> 00:24:36,204
- That's coming from Geneva.
- Jaime in Geneva.

550
00:24:36,204 --> 00:24:37,787
Sound Spanish or Portuguese.

551
00:24:37,787 --> 00:24:41,043
Trust is a key element
in the new venture

552
00:24:41,043 --> 00:24:42,479
because you have to do--

553
00:24:42,479 --> 00:24:44,712
Creating a venture is social activity

554
00:24:44,712 --> 00:24:47,535
and you are engaging with people
who give you funding,

555
00:24:47,535 --> 00:24:49,699
all kinds of stakeholders - 
with your customers,

556
00:24:49,699 --> 00:24:51,475
potential customers,
with suppliers,

557
00:24:51,475 --> 00:24:54,082
people who give you funding,
potential employees.

558
00:24:54,082 --> 00:24:57,732
In order for them 
to trust in your business,

559
00:24:57,732 --> 00:24:59,568
they first have to trust you.

560
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:02,032
So you are for them,
the business.

561
00:25:02,032 --> 00:25:03,727
It's a person-based trust.

562
00:25:03,727 --> 00:25:05,344
It's not like company-based trust.

563
00:25:05,344 --> 00:25:07,862
Well, the company is not there.
Face it, you know.

564
00:25:07,862 --> 00:25:10,544
You better make sure that
they can trust you,

565
00:25:10,544 --> 00:25:13,251
that you have a solid appearance
vis-a-vis your stakeholder,

566
00:25:13,251 --> 00:25:15,392
and once they trust you,

567
00:25:15,392 --> 00:25:17,933
they will trust later on the company
when it's there.

568
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:21,382
You are the face of the company.
You are the company.

569
00:25:21,382 --> 00:25:23,360
And that was an issue 
that we also discussed

570
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,005
in the crowdfunding part.

571
00:25:25,005 --> 00:25:28,509
Which is that if you don't deliver 
on your promises

572
00:25:28,509 --> 00:25:30,463
that you make
when you're crowdfunding,

573
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:33,693
for example, you've promised them 
delivery of a prototype

574
00:25:33,693 --> 00:25:35,188
and you don't follow through,

575
00:25:35,188 --> 00:25:38,253
then that's bad for the trust out aspect.

576
00:25:38,253 --> 00:25:40,313
- Exactly.
- It would be really hard to win that back.

577
00:25:40,313 --> 00:25:41,705
That can burn the trust 
in your whole company

578
00:25:41,705 --> 00:25:43,614
because that can go viral as well,
in forms, etc.

579
00:25:43,719 --> 00:25:46,518
So, make sure that you follow up
on your promises

580
00:25:46,518 --> 00:25:48,312
in the crowdfunding campaign.

581
00:25:48,312 --> 00:25:52,544
The next question, from Gregory Ayecs
from Port-au-Prince.

582
00:25:52,544 --> 00:25:54,570
- Hello to Port-au-Prince.
- In Haiti, wow!

583
00:25:54,570 --> 00:25:58,511
Yes. Is it easier to raise capital investment
from angel investors

584
00:25:58,511 --> 00:26:00,224
than venture capital firms?

585
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,832
And if yes, why?

586
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:05,939
Alright, we also talked about this
a lot in Week 4.

587
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:12,820
These are different sources
and they have different needs.

588
00:26:12,933 --> 00:26:14,316
Is it easier?

589
00:26:14,866 --> 00:26:16,800
I mean, you're usually not looking

590
00:26:16,839 --> 00:26:19,764
for a venture capital investment
early, early on.

591
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,646
You might be looking
for an angel investor early on.

592
00:26:22,646 --> 00:26:24,805
Early on, yes.

593
00:26:24,805 --> 00:26:27,866
It's easier to raise money from an angel
than it is from venture capital.

594
00:26:27,866 --> 00:26:29,033
Venture capitalists, in general

595
00:26:29,033 --> 00:26:30,517
are not going to touch
an early stage business.

596
00:26:30,517 --> 00:26:32,147
a really early seed stage business.

597
00:26:32,147 --> 00:26:35,359
So later on, hard to say.

598
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:38,343
People might say, "Well,
you're capital demand is too high,"

599
00:26:38,343 --> 00:26:39,786
and so an individual angel might just say,

600
00:26:39,786 --> 00:26:42,548
"Forget it. I don't want to go in on that."

601
00:26:42,548 --> 00:26:45,115
So it might be easier in some sense, later.

602
00:26:46,017 --> 00:26:49,991
It just depends on lot of factors
that you just can't compare them.

603
00:26:49,991 --> 00:26:52,972
They're not apples and apples.
Apples and oranges.

604
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:54,560
Something like that.

605
00:26:54,621 --> 00:26:57,832
Base it on the stage
that you're in.

606
00:26:57,832 --> 00:27:00,609
Exactly. I think <i>stage</i>
is on one of the keywords here.

607
00:27:00,609 --> 00:27:04,472
Yeah. Okay, here's Marco
from Ljubljana, Slovenia

608
00:27:04,472 --> 00:27:06,966
who is living in Abuja, Nigeria.
Excellent.

609
00:27:07,615 --> 00:27:10,720
What would be the best advice
to entrepreneurs

610
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,520
concerning money management?

611
00:27:12,988 --> 00:27:17,033
I think the best advice is that 
you look at the money in your company

612
00:27:17,033 --> 00:27:19,612
like the air that you have to breathe.

613
00:27:19,612 --> 00:27:20,978
It's so vital.

614
00:27:20,978 --> 00:27:24,425
If you run out of money,
your run out of air to breathe.

615
00:27:24,425 --> 00:27:26,931
And also cash flow management
is of vital importance.

616
00:27:26,931 --> 00:27:30,535
Monitor your cash outflows,
and monitor your cash inflows.

617
00:27:30,653 --> 00:27:32,711
Try to also analyze them.

618
00:27:32,711 --> 00:27:36,097
Why does money come from
a certain set of customers?

619
00:27:36,097 --> 00:27:38,274
Why do they spend more money
on your products

620
00:27:38,274 --> 00:27:41,418
and others for instance,
why do they do repeat purchases?

621
00:27:41,418 --> 00:27:43,840
So try to understand your money outflows,
your money inflows.

622
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,502
Get a good grip 
on your money management,

623
00:27:46,502 --> 00:27:47,714
your cash flow.

624
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:51,136
- Because it is the air that your breathe.
- Perfect.

625
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:53,886
Gregory again
from Port-au-Prince,

626
00:27:53,886 --> 00:27:54,891
another question from you.

627
00:27:54,891 --> 00:27:57,668
Should I raise some more money 
than I need and why?

628
00:27:57,763 --> 00:27:59,505
That's related to the question
we had before.

629
00:27:59,505 --> 00:28:00,351
- Yeah.

630
00:28:00,351 --> 00:28:04,745
I think it's always try to raise a bit more.

631
00:28:04,745 --> 00:28:09,342
First, investors might cut your wishlist,

632
00:28:09,342 --> 00:28:13,422
and second, it buys you time
until you have to raise funds again.

633
00:28:13,532 --> 00:28:15,762
That buys you time 
to actually start working

634
00:28:15,829 --> 00:28:17,720
and keep on working
on your company,

635
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,808
and getting your product out,
talking to customers, etc.

636
00:28:20,808 --> 00:28:23,691
It depends on your revenues
and cost streams.

637
00:28:23,691 --> 00:28:26,599
Your costs are always
going to be constant

638
00:28:26,599 --> 00:28:29,367
I mean, they're always
going to be there.

639
00:28:29,367 --> 00:28:31,364
Your revenues might be coming in
every once in a while.

640
00:28:31,364 --> 00:28:34,189
If there's a slight delay
in your revenues,

641
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:39,760
then you might up spending more 
than you thought you are going to.

642
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,149
I think the general rule of thumb
is people want to give money,

643
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:45,950
they want to make investments
in businesses

644
00:28:45,950 --> 00:28:48,116
that don't need investments.

645
00:28:48,221 --> 00:28:50,058
So I think that's the -- yes.

646
00:28:50,058 --> 00:28:52,757
If you can get more than what you need
any moment in time

647
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:54,697
but don't burn it
as we said in the prior question.

648
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:59,206
Then the next one is interesting.

649
00:28:59,206 --> 00:29:01,664
Who would you say 
is the <i>Marco Polo</i> of our time?

650
00:29:01,717 --> 00:29:05,246
So if you watched the Week 5, 
last segment,

651
00:29:05,246 --> 00:29:06,277
the last two minutes,

652
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:08,317
you know who the Marco Polos
of your time are.

653
00:29:08,317 --> 00:29:09,875
(laughing)

654
00:29:09,875 --> 00:29:13,100
- Go watch the end of Week 5.
- It starts at 5:18.

655
00:29:13,163 --> 00:29:15,284
- The very last second.
- Then we give this away.

656
00:29:15,445 --> 00:29:18,225
But give it-- second to those guys.

657
00:29:20,844 --> 00:29:23,420
In every country, you will probably have.

658
00:29:23,707 --> 00:29:25,463
This is the global MOOC

659
00:29:25,463 --> 00:29:27,664
I would say that there is not--

660
00:29:27,664 --> 00:29:28,884
You can always think about

661
00:29:28,884 --> 00:29:31,225
the big characters that we have
in entrepreneurship

662
00:29:32,106 --> 00:29:35,242
Without telling the names,
each of you has names in mind.

663
00:29:36,219 --> 00:29:38,560
Think about Elan Vasco,
Steve Jobs, whatever.

664
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:43,325
Generally, it's like--
I think entrepreneurship nowadays

665
00:29:43,325 --> 00:29:46,268
is a very democratic and pervasive

666
00:29:46,268 --> 00:29:49,964
and a much encountered phenomenon
across the globe.

667
00:29:49,964 --> 00:29:52,726
So each and every country
has its <i>Marco Polo's</i>.

668
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:56,385
Each and every country has its
adventurers who...

669
00:29:56,487 --> 00:29:57,589
Risk any curse.

670
00:29:57,589 --> 00:30:01,464
Risk-takers who embark 
on their entrepreneurial journey .

671
00:30:03,128 --> 00:30:07,227
Of course these big examples,
these well-known examples are inspiring.

672
00:30:07,426 --> 00:30:11,622
But there are lots of entrepreneurs
who are doing it on a smaller scale,

673
00:30:11,622 --> 00:30:13,978
who are doing something 
extremely innovative,

674
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,947
They deserve a lot of respect too

675
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:19,247
just because we don't know about them
and read about them in the news.

676
00:30:19,247 --> 00:30:22,587
They are fantastic entrepreneurs
that run great companies

677
00:30:22,587 --> 00:30:25,648
and I think they deserve
a lot of admiration too.

678
00:30:25,648 --> 00:30:30,208
So, a long story short,
yes, these people exist,

679
00:30:30,208 --> 00:30:32,648
the new <i>Marco Polo's</i>,
but on the other hand,

680
00:30:32,648 --> 00:30:35,304
their entrepreneurship 
is a much bigger phenomenon.

681
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:38,029
The secret will be revealed
in the last segment of Week 5.

682
00:30:39,863 --> 00:30:43,428
Question 9: Zierch Itoki
from Yaoundé, Cameroon.

683
00:30:43,455 --> 00:30:45,150
I have one point to you.

684
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:46,669
Don't ask these long questions.

685
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:49,256
This is like eight lines.

686
00:30:49,256 --> 00:30:53,795
Turning idea into value 
has always been my passion. Great.

687
00:30:53,795 --> 00:30:58,810
I always told myself that it is better to 
deploy your potential and passion

688
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:01,201
than just to be employed.

689
00:31:01,341 --> 00:31:03,487
We can agree to that.
That wasn't the question.

690
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,143
But in our country,

691
00:31:05,143 --> 00:31:08,280
it's very difficult to put together passion
and real possibilities.

692
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,473
In my country, young people 
are very interested

693
00:31:10,473 --> 00:31:11,975
about creating tech ventures,

694
00:31:11,975 --> 00:31:17,154
but our critical questions
are always returned.

695
00:31:17,154 --> 00:31:20,333
Is Africa really ready for Tech ventures?

696
00:31:20,564 --> 00:31:22,415
I think they skipped a line here.

697
00:31:22,415 --> 00:31:26,631
Which types of tech ventures
for whom Africa is ready

698
00:31:26,631 --> 00:31:28,487
to work on for good profits?

699
00:31:28,487 --> 00:31:33,623
Which type of tech ventures
work in Africa, in short?

700
00:31:33,998 --> 00:31:36,588
So you've been...we've been to Africa.

701
00:31:36,847 --> 00:31:41,381
What can I? I'm hesitant
to give advice.

702
00:31:41,381 --> 00:31:44,354
To make such prognostications

703
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:48,152
about the entire continent of Africa.

704
00:31:48,152 --> 00:31:50,007
But I have traveled around Africa a bit

705
00:31:50,107 --> 00:31:51,658
and I visited different parts.

706
00:31:51,658 --> 00:31:56,234
I was able to observe
co-working spaces,

707
00:31:56,234 --> 00:31:57,451
and startup hubs,

708
00:31:57,451 --> 00:32:01,934
and I see that tech ventures
are starting to take off

709
00:32:02,136 --> 00:32:03,771
even in Africa.

710
00:32:03,771 --> 00:32:06,908
And yes, you have to take
into consideration the fact

711
00:32:06,908 --> 00:32:08,873
that not every single person 
is going to be

712
00:32:08,873 --> 00:32:11,685
"internet connected" all the time.

713
00:32:12,267 --> 00:32:16,001
So the infrastructure maybe
is a little bit less

714
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,503
than what we will be used to.

715
00:32:17,503 --> 00:32:19,465
But that doesn't mean 
that there's no possibility.

716
00:32:19,465 --> 00:32:23,588
Some of those 
are interesting opportunities for people.

717
00:32:23,588 --> 00:32:28,082
And if you want some, as an inspiration,
go to this website, <i>My African Startup</i>.

718
00:32:28,082 --> 00:32:31,084
There are a lot of examples on there.

719
00:32:31,084 --> 00:32:34,553
And then Google sums up
some startup competitions.

720
00:32:34,553 --> 00:32:36,854
Yeah, I saw a lot of great examples.

721
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:39,233
Software products, apps,

722
00:32:39,233 --> 00:32:43,754
systems for monitoring inventory
in factories.

723
00:32:43,754 --> 00:32:48,345
Systems where it would tell people
the right time to plant crops

724
00:32:48,345 --> 00:32:52,984
based on small chips
that will detect the weather conditions

725
00:32:52,984 --> 00:32:55,533
and knowing what kind of seeds
are supposed to be planted,

726
00:32:55,533 --> 00:32:57,708
and then send an SMS,
"okay, now is the time to plant."

727
00:32:58,214 --> 00:33:00,396
So that's a tech startup too.

728
00:33:00,396 --> 00:33:03,502
There's a lot of exciting things 
going on in Africa.

729
00:33:04,444 --> 00:33:06,186
I agree, you should be passionate about it

730
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,750
and I think if you look around
you're going to find some things

731
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:12,090
that you'll be able to match up
your interests

732
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:16,447
will some latent needs 
that we don't realize that we have yet.

733
00:33:16,648 --> 00:33:19,249
- So keep on pushing Zierch.
- Yeah keep going Zierch.

734
00:33:21,038 --> 00:33:23,397
What's your favorite example
of viral marketing?

735
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,060
Can it be done tastefully?

736
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,862
(laughing)

737
00:33:27,263 --> 00:33:29,136
I know my favorite example
of viral marketing.

738
00:33:29,136 --> 00:33:30,573
Tell your favorite example.

739
00:33:30,573 --> 00:33:33,101
My favorite example
is <i>MCI Friends and Family</i>.

740
00:33:33,132 --> 00:33:36,923
It's not a recent business, right?

741
00:33:36,923 --> 00:33:40,374
This is the thing on the phone 
long distance service in the 1980s.

742
00:33:40,374 --> 00:33:41,798
- When he was young.
- Yeah.

743
00:33:41,798 --> 00:33:43,963
I don't know if I was even 
young back then.

744
00:33:43,963 --> 00:33:46,739
Okay. I was <i>younger</i>
in the 1980s.

745
00:33:49,772 --> 00:33:53,356
They'd call you 
and they would offer a discount

746
00:33:53,724 --> 00:33:57,098
if you and your friends and family

747
00:33:57,098 --> 00:34:00,200
had worn the plan, the MCI plan.

748
00:34:00,367 --> 00:34:02,358
And so people would give the names
of their relatives

749
00:34:03,732 --> 00:34:06,487
to the person who's calling
on the phone, to the operator

750
00:34:06,487 --> 00:34:09,038
and they would take them
and they would get discounts.

751
00:34:09,038 --> 00:34:10,637
And that created a list.

752
00:34:10,637 --> 00:34:13,417
That was a very early, early on
viral marketing campaign.

753
00:34:13,417 --> 00:34:16,237
So for me, that's a very
interesting example.

754
00:34:16,237 --> 00:34:19,396
And actually in our forums,
on the Coursera forums

755
00:34:19,396 --> 00:34:21,517
there are some very nice examples here.

756
00:34:21,517 --> 00:34:23,468
I think this was 
a very humorous discussion

757
00:34:23,468 --> 00:34:25,318
that the people had on there.

758
00:34:25,318 --> 00:34:29,433
How much time is it okay
to spend on building my product?

759
00:34:29,433 --> 00:34:31,382
So that's one of these questions

760
00:34:31,382 --> 00:34:33,602
that is of course related
to a minimum viable product.

761
00:34:33,602 --> 00:34:36,021
It's like a question, "How big is a fish?"

762
00:34:36,111 --> 00:34:37,470
Yeah (laughter).

763
00:34:37,470 --> 00:34:39,382
There's small ones,
There are big ones.

764
00:34:39,382 --> 00:34:41,609
It depends on the product of course.

765
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:45,645
Some products, you can do 
a minimum viable product

766
00:34:45,645 --> 00:34:48,696
because your customers actually
will be able to give you feedback.

767
00:34:48,696 --> 00:34:49,862
But with other products,

768
00:34:49,862 --> 00:34:53,561
especially oftentimes B2B setttings,
<i>business to business</i> settings,

769
00:34:53,561 --> 00:34:58,329
your customers don't want to work
with a minimum viable product.

770
00:34:58,329 --> 00:35:02,533
They want to have the full proof,
the fail-proof version.

771
00:35:03,302 --> 00:35:05,744
So it really depends 
on your target segments.

772
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,533
There is no one single, good answer.

773
00:35:08,533 --> 00:35:13,020
Of course if you can test
your products' attractiveness

774
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:15,065
and get feedback from the customers

775
00:35:15,065 --> 00:35:18,032
with a low-key, minumum version,
go for that

776
00:35:18,032 --> 00:35:19,376
because you're not wasting money.

777
00:35:19,401 --> 00:35:21,324
- Front-end, very nice.
- Exactly.

778
00:35:21,324 --> 00:35:23,881
If you have contacts 
even in a business B2B setting,

779
00:35:23,881 --> 00:35:26,312
you might be able to do
a front-end and get feedback.

780
00:35:26,372 --> 00:35:28,400
But I think the more interesting question

781
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:31,135
is how much time did you have for
before you run out of cash?

782
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,818
Then that's going to determine a lot.

783
00:35:35,189 --> 00:35:36,976
Try and go as fast as you can.

784
00:35:37,237 --> 00:35:39,122
But remember it's going to cost you.

785
00:35:39,122 --> 00:35:40,557
I think that's part of the--

786
00:35:40,557 --> 00:35:43,051
maybe just underlining 
this comment a little bit.

787
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,249
What is a good idea?

788
00:35:48,186 --> 00:35:51,205
Is it one that is more profitable,
more innovative,

789
00:35:51,205 --> 00:35:53,541
more available, or more useable?

790
00:35:54,949 --> 00:35:57,277
- It's like a multiple choice question.
- Right.

791
00:35:57,888 --> 00:36:00,484
- You're testing us.
- They're giving us a quiz now.

792
00:36:01,307 --> 00:36:04,640
I think the best idea is an idea

793
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,044
where your customers 
are willing to pay you.

794
00:36:07,151 --> 00:36:09,740
Presented more than once in the MOOC.

795
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,294
You don't create a business 
for creating a product.

796
00:36:12,294 --> 00:36:14,420
You create it for creating a customer.

797
00:36:15,064 --> 00:36:18,136
So from that perspective,
think about your customers.

798
00:36:18,379 --> 00:36:20,181
Think about what your customers want.

799
00:36:20,181 --> 00:36:22,371
If they are willing to pay
for your product,

800
00:36:22,371 --> 00:36:24,526
for the functionality in your product,

801
00:36:24,526 --> 00:36:26,329
for the benefits of this product.

802
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:28,915
This actually brings us
to the final question.

803
00:36:28,915 --> 00:36:32,975
It says, "You say, 'customers 
do not buy features, they buy benefits.'

804
00:36:32,975 --> 00:36:33,983
What does this mean?"

805
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:38,489
Yeah. Basically, what this is referring to

806
00:36:38,489 --> 00:36:44,094
is that the customers don't care 
about the features <i>per se</i>.

807
00:36:44,571 --> 00:36:48,043
All they care about is
how they can use it.

808
00:36:48,043 --> 00:36:49,555
Is it valuable for them?

809
00:36:49,555 --> 00:36:51,769
Does it save them money?
Does it save them time?

810
00:36:51,769 --> 00:36:53,884
Does it meet their need?

811
00:36:53,884 --> 00:36:55,439
And so having an extra feature,

812
00:36:55,439 --> 00:36:57,467
what we're talking about 
a little bit before hand,

813
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,303
one idea is like a battery.

814
00:36:59,303 --> 00:37:00,882
You're changing a battery on a phone.

815
00:37:00,882 --> 00:37:03,829
That's kind of like a feature.
It's a replaceable battery.

816
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,780
That's great. That's a feature.

817
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:07,882
But that's not really 
what the customer wants.

818
00:37:07,949 --> 00:37:10,456
The customer wants a long battery life.

819
00:37:10,456 --> 00:37:13,080
The customer wants the phone
to go a very long time.

820
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,746
So maybe that feature helps
what the customer wants

821
00:37:16,746 --> 00:37:18,950
because they can carry spare batteries
or something like that,

822
00:37:18,950 --> 00:37:20,711
then thus giving them more time.

823
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:22,289
But you got to focus on the part
that the customer wants,

824
00:37:22,289 --> 00:37:25,420
not the part that bells and whistles
that you add,

825
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,190
unless it solved the problem.

826
00:37:27,190 --> 00:37:28,948
And that's quite important
with the marketing campaign.

827
00:37:28,948 --> 00:37:32,305
Because you could say,
"This phone or camera

828
00:37:32,305 --> 00:37:34,938
can replaceable-made batteries,"
and I was like...

829
00:37:34,938 --> 00:37:36,857
What the customer wants--

830
00:37:36,857 --> 00:37:38,900
the customer only understands
when you say,

831
00:37:38,900 --> 00:37:42,676
- "With this phone you can --"
- talk for five days!

832
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,732
- That's what he cares about.
- Right.

833
00:37:45,947 --> 00:37:47,412
So that was already all the questions.

834
00:37:47,412 --> 00:37:49,429
Yeah. I think that's basically 
the questions for this week.

835
00:37:49,429 --> 00:37:52,032
Thanks for watching the MOOC's
and for sending in the questions.

836
00:37:52,032 --> 00:37:54,665
Some of them will be handwritten.

837
00:37:54,665 --> 00:37:56,734
We'll send you 
some handwritten responses.

838
00:37:56,734 --> 00:38:00,552
Exactly. To make this also
moving back to the old world.

839
00:38:02,179 --> 00:38:04,007
- So thanks very much.
- Thanks for joining us.

840
00:38:04,007 --> 00:38:06,641
Thanks for joining us.
See you back in MOOC-land.
