1
00:00:08,167 --> 00:00:09,751
Hi! I'm Nettra Pan.

2
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:11,293
And I'm Shirah Foy.

3
00:00:11,334 --> 00:00:13,543
You'll be seeing the both of us
throughout this MOOC

4
00:00:13,544 --> 00:00:16,712
with tips and information
on how to make the most of this course.

5
00:00:17,209 --> 00:00:19,249
We're both based at EPFL,

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,874
the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
in Lausanne, Switzerland.

7
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:26,195
EPFL has established
amazing long term partnerships

8
00:00:26,209 --> 00:00:30,209
with outstanding academic institutions
across the African continent.

9
00:00:30,183 --> 00:00:34,322
In this video, we're going
to be introducing to you 5 entrepreneurs

10
00:00:34,323 --> 00:00:36,271
who are facing issues similar to the ones

11
00:00:36,292 --> 00:00:38,709
you're going to be learning about
in this course.

12
00:00:38,697 --> 00:00:41,575
In the next few months, we're planning
to add more interviews

13
00:00:41,576 --> 00:00:45,185
to our archives from West Africa,
South Africa, and around the world.

14
00:00:45,551 --> 00:00:47,410
<i>(Nettra) We caught up
with the entrepreneurs</i>

15
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:52,198
<i>that you'll be meeting this week
in Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda.</i>

16
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:54,154
They work in a range of industries

17
00:00:54,155 --> 00:00:57,249
from medical technologies to agriculture

18
00:00:57,250 --> 00:01:00,536
to mobile technologies and finance.

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,234
But the one thing
that they all had in common

20
00:01:03,235 --> 00:01:04,833
was the entrepreneurial mindset.

21
00:01:05,821 --> 00:01:10,405
They brought resources together
to create value where before,

22
00:01:10,406 --> 00:01:12,664
there were little or none.

23
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:16,234
The other thing that they had in common
was that they all shared

24
00:01:16,235 --> 00:01:19,405
a defining entrepreneurial moment,
decision, or event.

25
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:23,436
Finally, they all engaged
in the long process

26
00:01:23,437 --> 00:01:25,764
of developing their venture.

27
00:01:25,765 --> 00:01:27,504
As they introduce themselves,

28
00:01:27,505 --> 00:01:29,484
really try to put yourself
in their situation

29
00:01:29,485 --> 00:01:32,254
and think about how you would've
brought together resources

30
00:01:32,255 --> 00:01:35,227
in similar conditions
with the same constraints.

31
00:01:35,228 --> 00:01:38,770
Because resource constraints are
a challenge faced by every entrepreneur

32
00:01:38,771 --> 00:01:41,015
in every country and in every industry.

33
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,651
OK. Let's meet some entrepreneurs.

34
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:47,956
Our first featured entrepreneur,
Joel Macharia,

35
00:01:47,957 --> 00:01:51,023
adopted the entrepreneurial mindset
at a very young age.

36
00:01:51,024 --> 00:01:53,350
This led him to start
a financial news company

37
00:01:53,351 --> 00:01:56,135
and a financial consulting business
among others.

38
00:01:56,411 --> 00:01:59,632
I like how Joel talked about
the mental strength required

39
00:01:59,633 --> 00:02:02,597
to be a successful entrepreneur.

40
00:02:02,598 --> 00:02:06,084
This is especially important
for high growth tech entrepreneurs

41
00:02:06,085 --> 00:02:09,616
who are often working in fast paced
and high stress environments.

42
00:02:10,252 --> 00:02:14,669
In a way, you're going to be seeing
how Joel talks about

43
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,417
this process of entrepreneurship
as going from a <i>no to a yes.</i>

44
00:02:19,836 --> 00:02:22,245
He says that for every one year,

45
00:02:22,246 --> 00:02:26,857
you can expect to hear
the word <i>no</i> about 100 times.

46
00:02:26,858 --> 00:02:28,925
Along his entrepreneurial process,

47
00:02:28,926 --> 00:02:31,007
he also talks about
how important it was for him

48
00:02:31,008 --> 00:02:33,608
to have the support
of his friends and family.

49
00:02:34,197 --> 00:02:37,261
With the support
and his mental determination,

50
00:02:37,262 --> 00:02:40,854
he managed to perfect his offer
for investors and clients,

51
00:02:40,855 --> 00:02:44,008
transforming all
of those <i>noes</i> to a big <i>yes</i>.

52
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:46,687
(chattering children)

53
00:02:57,755 --> 00:02:59,274
My name is Joel Macharia.

54
00:02:59,275 --> 00:03:00,685
I'm 28 years old.

55
00:03:00,686 --> 00:03:02,460
I'll be 28 in August.

56
00:03:02,461 --> 00:03:06,017
I'm the founder of Capital Associates,
which I started in August of 2007

57
00:03:06,018 --> 00:03:07,524
when I was 21.

58
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:10,319
Capital Associates is currently
a financial consulting business

59
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,135
focused on small businesses
and helping them figure out

60
00:03:13,136 --> 00:03:15,998
how to manage their money,
how to access capital,

61
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,881
and just kept to be proper businesses

62
00:03:17,882 --> 00:03:20,300
when it comes to running
and handling their finances.

63
00:03:20,301 --> 00:03:23,788
On top of that,
we're building an online platform

64
00:03:23,789 --> 00:03:26,542
that will allow
retail investors, individuals

65
00:03:26,543 --> 00:03:29,466
to invest in the Nairobi Stock Exchange

66
00:03:29,467 --> 00:03:34,916
providing them the tools, tips, tutorials
on how to get started and how to invest.

67
00:03:35,806 --> 00:03:41,484
That platform is called Abacus
from the old calculator.

68
00:03:43,341 --> 00:03:46,318
I started my interest
in the financial markets

69
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,678
in the Nairobi Securities Exchange
or the Stock Exchange as it was known.

70
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,641
I started back when I was in high school.

71
00:03:52,709 --> 00:03:54,927
When in my last year and my fourth form,

72
00:03:54,928 --> 00:03:57,293
we had a trip to the NSE.

73
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,263
I couldn't understand how people
seem to make money out of nothing,

74
00:04:01,264 --> 00:04:03,139
pieces of paper that were selling

75
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:05,820
for some reason
or the other at higher and higher prices.

76
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:11,715
I wasn't used to not understanding
concepts so it became an obsession.

77
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:13,919
I guess I liked math.

78
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,997
This was something mathematical,
or it felt very mathematical.

79
00:04:16,998 --> 00:04:19,298
In 2004 when I graduated
from high school--

80
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,751
actually after my KCSO, I went
into the Nairobi Stock Exchange,

81
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:25,039
and I asked them
to give [an introduction].

82
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,112
I got a job doing data entry
somewhere in the filing rooms

83
00:04:29,113 --> 00:04:32,251
and full records
that were being digitized.

84
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:34,087
But I felt like
I wasn't learning anything.

85
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:35,860
They didn't give me
an opportunity to learn

86
00:04:35,861 --> 00:04:37,680
about how the market actually worked.

87
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:41,708
So I left and started to do
my own research.

88
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:44,043
I spent all day in a cybercafe cafe

89
00:04:44,559 --> 00:04:47,218
because back then 3G
hadn't picked up.

90
00:04:47,219 --> 00:04:49,492
It was really expensive
to get online on your phone.

91
00:04:49,501 --> 00:04:52,668
We didn't have WiMax connections.
We didn't have free Wi-Fi.

92
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:54,892
We didn't have cable connections
into the homes.

93
00:04:54,893 --> 00:04:57,046
So you know, for 500 shillings,
a shilling a minute,

94
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,288
I'll have a whole day's worth of surfing.

95
00:05:01,042 --> 00:05:04,088
I'm going and go to Investopedia.

96
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:06,295
I still remember this.
I loved Investopedia.

97
00:05:06,296 --> 00:05:09,711
I'd copy a lot of
their tutorials, explanations,

98
00:05:09,712 --> 00:05:12,974
and how the market worked
and what was what.

99
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:17,622
I'd paste that to a one document,
and then save that, and then go home

100
00:05:17,623 --> 00:05:20,160
and use that and read that all day.

101
00:05:20,703 --> 00:05:23,114
I'd read it and then
go to the Stock Market.

102
00:05:23,115 --> 00:05:26,000
I'll call my stockbroker
and ask several questions.

103
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:29,942
I borrowed money from my dad
to invest in the stock market

104
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,459
when there's an IPO coming up.

105
00:05:33,806 --> 00:05:35,434
The IPO did very well.

106
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,502
I turned that into other investments
because it went up.

107
00:05:38,503 --> 00:05:39,595
I sold my share.

108
00:05:39,596 --> 00:05:41,787
Instead of taking the money out,
I decided to buy other shares.

109
00:05:41,806 --> 00:05:44,440
My dad also got interested.

110
00:05:44,441 --> 00:05:48,587
He asked me to take him through
while I was doing to teach him.

111
00:05:49,203 --> 00:05:51,557
That's how I got started
teaching people around

112
00:05:51,558 --> 00:05:54,002
how to invest in the stock exchange.

113
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:58,523
Between 2004 when I graduated
from high school and 2007,

114
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,981
the market was on a tear.

115
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:04,354
It was bull market and it hit
It's highest peak in 2006.

116
00:06:05,693 --> 00:06:07,764
It was a success investment.

117
00:06:07,765 --> 00:06:10,272
That's where everybody wanted
to put their money into.

118
00:06:10,273 --> 00:06:11,571
It was very easy for me--

119
00:06:11,572 --> 00:06:12,794
(door bell rang)

120
00:06:12,795 --> 00:06:14,348
- Sorry.
<i>- It's okay.</i>

121
00:06:14,349 --> 00:06:15,951
I was very easy for me

122
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:19,359
to get more and more people
be interested in learning.

123
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:22,734
What happened is they'd learned
how the market worked.

124
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:25,379
The next thing they want is--
they'd be like, "Here,"

125
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:26,598
They'll give me a sum,

126
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,959
"Here are 100,000 shillings.
Why don't you pick the shares?

127
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:31,336
You know I'm a doctor,
I have patients to deal with.

128
00:06:31,337 --> 00:06:34,893
300,000 shillings. Invest this for us."

129
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,750
That's why I started Capital Associates.

130
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:40,404
It was ideally you're partnering
in capital.

131
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:42,705
(children chattering)

132
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,147
My first entrepreneurial experience,

133
00:06:51,148 --> 00:06:56,408
I think what I do remember
was actually trading food.

134
00:06:58,334 --> 00:07:03,085
I think it must've been, what,
nine years old, where my mom paid.

135
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:06,192
We had an account to a small eatery

136
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:08,410
very close to the school where I was at.

137
00:07:09,248 --> 00:07:13,934
We'd go over, eat I think up to
30 shillings, and then go back to school.

138
00:07:13,935 --> 00:07:16,556
My mom would pay this,
either at the end of the day--

139
00:07:16,557 --> 00:07:18,776
This was within our office complex.

140
00:07:20,424 --> 00:07:25,509
I remember going in and taking chapatis,
which is some flat kind of bread.

141
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,994
We marketed it to school
and exchanging that.

142
00:07:27,995 --> 00:07:31,431
I'd have five chapatis
and I'd sell those in school.

143
00:07:31,432 --> 00:07:35,702
I trade one chapati
with somebody who had rice,

144
00:07:35,703 --> 00:07:39,426
another one for somebody
who had beans so I had my meal.

145
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:43,382
Then I'd sell that at three
and buy sweets.

146
00:07:44,167 --> 00:07:47,584
I think that's [las de alias]
I can remember.

147
00:07:48,698 --> 00:07:50,640
I do remember selling bread
in high school.

148
00:07:50,641 --> 00:07:53,276
Airtime, I mean cell phones
had just become the thing.

149
00:07:53,557 --> 00:07:57,576
I was a prefect in high school
so I can get away with a lot of things

150
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:59,839
so people brought me
their cell phones to keep for them

151
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,206
and charge, and just make sure

152
00:08:01,207 --> 00:08:03,839
they didn't get confiscated
by the rest of the prefects.

153
00:08:05,737 --> 00:08:09,438
Selling Airtime,
selling bread in the school,

154
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:11,622
writing letters, poetry.

155
00:08:13,728 --> 00:08:16,968
Poetry was actually
one of the things I did a lot of.

156
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:19,777
I remember my trademark.

157
00:08:19,778 --> 00:08:24,469
Poem would be the first letter of--
so it spelled the name going down

158
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:28,490
and then using each letter
[at the beginning] of the sentence.

159
00:08:30,349 --> 00:08:32,729
Then of course, after high school,

160
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:35,500
it's been pretty much
different experiences,

161
00:08:35,501 --> 00:08:38,418
experimenting with exporting handicrafts.

162
00:08:38,419 --> 00:08:40,337
under the African Growth
and Opportunity Act

163
00:08:40,339 --> 00:08:42,789
which went into the US tax-free,

164
00:08:45,248 --> 00:08:47,482
sold cars, imported.

165
00:08:49,382 --> 00:08:50,732
My business partner had a cousin

166
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,118
who would send
the cars over from the UK.

167
00:08:53,119 --> 00:08:55,089
Then we would sell them here.

168
00:08:56,356 --> 00:09:00,419
Then we put money together,
bought accident vehicles, write-offs

169
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:04,642
and fix them up and put them
back on the road and sold them.

170
00:09:05,834 --> 00:09:09,335
I mean it's been a varied
set of experiences.

171
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:13,660
The [alias] I can remember
it's actually the chapatis back in--

172
00:09:13,667 --> 00:09:16,459
must've been eight or nine years old.

173
00:09:17,476 --> 00:09:19,470
(chattering children)

174
00:09:25,234 --> 00:09:28,853
One my favorite quotes
says that entrepreneurship

175
00:09:28,854 --> 00:09:32,477
is living a few years of your life
in a way most people won't,

176
00:09:32,478 --> 00:09:34,983
to live the rest of it
in a way most people can't.

177
00:09:35,765 --> 00:09:37,866
It's actually a difficult thing.

178
00:09:37,867 --> 00:09:41,863
You have to be ready for it
and never give up because that's where--

179
00:09:43,148 --> 00:09:46,594
Get your resources in place
in terms of personal support.

180
00:09:46,595 --> 00:09:48,242
Spouse, make sure they know what it is.

181
00:09:48,243 --> 00:09:49,978
Parents, family, get those

182
00:09:49,979 --> 00:09:53,382
because those are the things
that will matter the most.

183
00:09:53,383 --> 00:09:55,010
(chattering children)

184
00:10:01,442 --> 00:10:04,166
An entrepreneur will get
that [person] eight hours a day

185
00:10:04,167 --> 00:10:05,067
that they can sell.

186
00:10:05,068 --> 00:10:07,246
Find 5 of them, the funding
to build an office

187
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:09,058
and then go out and get the business.

188
00:10:09,059 --> 00:10:10,869
Make sure that all five have--

189
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:15,183
by pulling all this
and paying all these costs,

190
00:10:15,184 --> 00:10:17,762
then it's left with something
on top of it, which is the profit.

191
00:10:17,763 --> 00:10:21,631
That role is a very solitary role.

192
00:10:21,632 --> 00:10:23,690
It's a very difficult role.

193
00:10:23,691 --> 00:10:26,816
I mean noes exceed yeses

194
00:10:26,817 --> 00:10:29,738
by a factor of 1 to 100.

195
00:10:29,739 --> 00:10:33,370
So for every one year,

196
00:10:33,371 --> 00:10:36,041
you probably need
to go through 100 noes.

197
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:42,629
The thing you can do
is to prepare yourself mentally

198
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:45,711
to realize that you need
to keep your perspective.

199
00:10:45,712 --> 00:10:49,035
You need to always remember
what you're looking for.

200
00:10:49,036 --> 00:10:50,660
(chattering children)

201
00:10:57,188 --> 00:11:00,001
If I was to offer advice
to an entrepreneur

202
00:11:00,002 --> 00:11:02,328
who's thinking of going
into entrepreneurship

203
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:05,078
or somebody who's thinking
of going into entrepreneurship,

204
00:11:05,079 --> 00:11:06,407
invest in yourself.

205
00:11:06,408 --> 00:11:07,834
That would be what I tell them.

206
00:11:07,835 --> 00:11:12,712
Ideally, what happens is that,
for very, very long time--

207
00:11:12,713 --> 00:11:15,298
I mean, by the classical definition
of what an entrepreneur is,

208
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:17,438
it's somebody who puts
resources together.

209
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:19,416
I know guys who have been
in business seven years.

210
00:11:19,417 --> 00:11:21,729
They have been researching seven years,

211
00:11:22,705 --> 00:11:27,010
and they still haven't figured out
how to get started.

212
00:11:27,792 --> 00:11:30,167
There will never be
a right time for anything.

213
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:33,337
You always get started now.
Make the decisions.

214
00:11:33,338 --> 00:11:35,088
Be decisive. Move forward.

215
00:11:35,089 --> 00:11:37,360
Then pick the results as they're coming.

216
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:39,968
Then make the next decision.

217
00:11:39,969 --> 00:11:42,204
<i>(interviewer) Thank you very much.</i>

218
00:11:43,251 --> 00:11:46,342
Many of you may be familiar
with the serial entrepreneur,

219
00:11:46,343 --> 00:11:47,871
Richard Branson.

220
00:11:47,876 --> 00:11:51,835
When asked by a journalist,
"Why did you go into business?"

221
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:54,520
Richard Branson says that he realized

222
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:57,773
that he never actually wanted
to go into business.

223
00:11:57,774 --> 00:12:00,928
He says he was just interested
in creating things.

224
00:12:00,929 --> 00:12:05,003
Well, our next entrepreneur
sounds a lot like Richard Branson.

225
00:12:05,004 --> 00:12:07,862
His name is Yohans Wodaje.

226
00:12:07,863 --> 00:12:13,032
Like Branson, Yohans, wasn't fixated
on the idea of going into business.

227
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:17,436
He says he didn't even know
what the word "entrepreneur" meant

228
00:12:17,437 --> 00:12:19,093
until very recently.

229
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:22,179
Yohans simply brought resources together.

230
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,499
This was medical information
with the web platform

231
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:32,065
and then became medical services
with mobile technology.

232
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:36,584
Slowly but surely, Yohans brought
resources together to create value.

233
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:40,625
When he was feeling stretched,
that's when he sought business partners

234
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:43,181
and staff to help him sustain his venture.

235
00:12:44,626 --> 00:12:48,080
Another thing to listen for Yohans's story

236
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:51,348
is how he de-risked
his venture along the way.

237
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,265
At the beginning
of an entrepreneurial process,

238
00:12:54,266 --> 00:12:57,430
the chance that a venture
will fail is very high

239
00:12:57,431 --> 00:13:00,234
compared to the chances
that it will succeed.

240
00:13:00,235 --> 00:13:05,226
Yohans says that in a developing country,
the risks are even higher.

241
00:13:05,227 --> 00:13:08,041
That's why it's so important
to develop your venture

242
00:13:08,042 --> 00:13:10,426
in a way that reduces risks.

243
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:13,050
Let's switch over it to Yohans.

244
00:13:13,454 --> 00:13:14,974
(chattering children)

245
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:38,626
I was born and raised
in Ethiopia here in Addis.

246
00:13:38,652 --> 00:13:40,746
I went to medicine school here.

247
00:13:40,747 --> 00:13:42,413
I'm a medical doctor by profession.

248
00:13:42,414 --> 00:13:45,279
That's how I'm related to medicine.

249
00:13:45,901 --> 00:13:50,629
I worked in the rural parts of Ethiopia
right after medicine school.

250
00:13:52,304 --> 00:13:55,517
During that time,
I was thinking about what I could do

251
00:13:56,761 --> 00:13:58,901
because I wanted to do
something on my own.

252
00:13:58,923 --> 00:14:02,326
Also, it was very visible to me

253
00:14:04,834 --> 00:14:08,623
the scale of limitations
in infrastructure we have in this country.

254
00:14:08,723 --> 00:14:12,756
So I got interested in systems,
the health systems.

255
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,078
Then when I came back to the city

256
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:17,213
after working
in the rural parts of Ethiopia,

257
00:14:17,214 --> 00:14:21,508
I had the opportunity to work
with friends from other walks of life

258
00:14:21,509 --> 00:14:23,970
who are in technology and engineering.

259
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:30,260
We just set up websites
in the hopes of creating a platform

260
00:14:30,261 --> 00:14:33,320
for people to get access
to health information

261
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,140
in their local language, into Amharic,

262
00:14:35,421 --> 00:14:38,998
and also thinking of expanding it
to other local languages.

263
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:42,021
With that endeavor,
we set up this website.

264
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:45,362
Eventually, I got introduced
to another company

265
00:14:45,363 --> 00:14:49,543
that was working on increasing access,
ability of services to people

266
00:14:49,544 --> 00:14:52,239
by creating a platform
that allows people

267
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,360
to access different services
on their mobile phones.

268
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:57,461
Then it became a nice marriage
within these two companies,

269
00:14:57,462 --> 00:15:00,210
rises up my company,
Telemed Medical Services

270
00:15:00,211 --> 00:15:02,626
and partner up
with BelCash Technology Solutions,

271
00:15:02,641 --> 00:15:06,776
which is a company,
that the mobile enabler company.

272
00:15:06,777 --> 00:15:09,333
We set up product for Hello Doctor

273
00:15:09,334 --> 00:15:14,268
that allows people to access
health advisory services

274
00:15:14,269 --> 00:15:18,091
using their mobile phones
or any phone actually

275
00:15:18,092 --> 00:15:21,271
and be able to talk
or consult with a doctor.

276
00:15:22,336 --> 00:15:23,945
(chattering children)

277
00:15:28,433 --> 00:15:30,976
I actually learned
that word very recently.

278
00:15:30,977 --> 00:15:32,488
(interviewer giggles)

279
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:38,019
If you're asking me, I think it was
when I was in high school.

280
00:15:38,623 --> 00:15:42,861
I saw people that I looked up to
that were doing things,

281
00:15:42,862 --> 00:15:44,344
that started things.

282
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:47,615
I kind of had the desire
to also do something

283
00:15:47,616 --> 00:15:49,379
or to start something.

284
00:15:50,303 --> 00:15:52,315
(chattering children)

285
00:15:59,402 --> 00:16:04,570
I cannot quite put a finger
on what's really attracted me

286
00:16:04,571 --> 00:16:07,780
to starting something on my own
and becoming an entrepreneur.

287
00:16:07,781 --> 00:16:12,127
But I've always been passionate

288
00:16:12,335 --> 00:16:16,276
when I get interested
in a certain thing, whatever it is.

289
00:16:16,277 --> 00:16:17,461
It could be music.

290
00:16:17,462 --> 00:16:20,074
It could be whatever thing
I start thinking about,

291
00:16:20,075 --> 00:16:23,792
I tend to be passionate about it
to continue to dwell on it,

292
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:29,762
and have the urge to take it
sort of in my own way.

293
00:16:29,763 --> 00:16:33,869
I can't quite see that as the thing
that attracted me about it.

294
00:16:34,635 --> 00:16:36,544
Also, there's a lot of things
that I feel about

295
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:41,261
doing something on your own,
or starting something on your own.

296
00:16:41,262 --> 00:16:42,820
You cannot do anything on your own.

297
00:16:42,821 --> 00:16:44,919
You basically start something on your own

298
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:47,407
and eventually built the team
that helps you do it.

299
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:51,675
The beautiful thing about that,,
I think the most fulfilling feeling

300
00:16:51,676 --> 00:16:57,088
is that the sense of creating
something or starting something.

301
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,109
That's a very fulfilling feeling.

302
00:17:00,878 --> 00:17:02,908
(chattering children)

303
00:17:10,424 --> 00:17:15,175
I did feel I had the skills
to be able to do what I had in mind,

304
00:17:15,176 --> 00:17:17,914
which was create a platform
to be able to teach people

305
00:17:17,915 --> 00:17:21,729
or to help people access information.

306
00:17:22,127 --> 00:17:25,954
That's why we were doing it
when we started the website with friends.

307
00:17:25,954 --> 00:17:28,031
We didn't have a company then.

308
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:34,466
The need to create a company
came later on as things progressed.

309
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:39,267
I really didn't have time
to stop and reflect

310
00:17:39,268 --> 00:17:44,129
on whether I can set up a company
and run a company or anything like that.

311
00:17:44,148 --> 00:17:46,161
It just sort of happened.

312
00:17:46,162 --> 00:17:51,531
Eventually,
once it actually started to grow

313
00:17:52,153 --> 00:17:54,537
--grow in a sense
like very [small], yeah?--

314
00:17:54,538 --> 00:17:57,818
It stopped becoming just me,
and I started hiring people.

315
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,741
When those things came,

316
00:18:00,147 --> 00:18:03,115
I actually got the sense of what it means.

317
00:18:03,981 --> 00:18:05,265
This is really a company.

318
00:18:05,266 --> 00:18:07,799
People are relying on us
so we're hiring people.

319
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,650
We have to make paycheck.

320
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:13,792
We have to make payroll every month
and all those questions.

321
00:18:13,793 --> 00:18:16,019
Then we start asking those questions.

322
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:21,024
Am I really going to push through?
Are we going to be able to do this?

323
00:18:23,354 --> 00:18:26,145
You've already done something
that you feel like you could.

324
00:18:26,562 --> 00:18:28,412
(children chattering)

325
00:18:35,526 --> 00:18:39,393
I guess from my experience, the advice
I can give to aspiring entrepreneurs

326
00:18:39,394 --> 00:18:43,159
is to think of two things.

327
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:50,190
One, that you may not be able
to do it all on your own.

328
00:18:52,547 --> 00:18:56,297
That may mean that you have
to give a share of your bread.

329
00:18:56,581 --> 00:19:01,691
But if you want to make things happen
and get things moving,

330
00:19:02,253 --> 00:19:06,433
I think it's really smart to
look into partnerships.

331
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:12,266
It really helps not just in terms
of getting things to roll out fast,

332
00:19:12,267 --> 00:19:17,469
not just in terms of
lowering your initial costs.

333
00:19:18,484 --> 00:19:23,172
It's also very helpful
in terms of having a party.

334
00:19:23,173 --> 00:19:27,208
When you're doing good,
your partner may be not doing well

335
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:30,668
and use the one that's giving the push
and then vice versa.

336
00:19:30,688 --> 00:19:33,955
In your [...], you have a partner
that's saying like,

337
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:39,633
"It has worked out well for us, so come."
It sort of pushes each other.

338
00:19:40,558 --> 00:19:42,163
Find the right marriage

339
00:19:42,164 --> 00:19:45,508
and always do things, make things easier.

340
00:19:45,509 --> 00:19:50,456
Whatever you can do by partnering
and giving it to the right people

341
00:19:50,457 --> 00:19:54,255
to do themselves and sharing
I think is a good strategy.

342
00:19:54,256 --> 00:19:56,037
That has helped us.

343
00:19:56,897 --> 00:19:59,374
In any developing country,

344
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,500
--I don't think it's very unique
to Addis Abbaba or Ethiopia--

345
00:20:02,523 --> 00:20:05,059
there's a lot of things
that could test your patience.

346
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:09,955
Most developing countries
are just starting

347
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:14,498
to really make robust infrastructure
when it comes to--

348
00:20:14,499 --> 00:20:16,679
especially if you work in the IT sector.

349
00:20:17,334 --> 00:20:19,293
Telecom services can be

350
00:20:20,224 --> 00:20:24,810
not so reliable at times and tricky.

351
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:27,954
But it's important to understand
that in mostly like that,

352
00:20:28,918 --> 00:20:31,085
it's important to strategize for it

353
00:20:31,115 --> 00:20:34,858
to sort of mitigate that risk
from the outset.

354
00:20:37,607 --> 00:20:41,287
That's one thing that's unique
to functioning in an emerging market,

355
00:20:41,288 --> 00:20:43,951
I think, that we have had to deal with.

356
00:20:44,667 --> 00:20:47,876
As we're growing,
so is our telco industry.

357
00:20:47,907 --> 00:20:50,407
We're sort of learning at the same time.

358
00:20:51,627 --> 00:20:54,827
It's important like I say,
to be patient and understand,

359
00:20:54,828 --> 00:20:57,225
and actually develop the relationship

360
00:20:57,226 --> 00:20:59,618
and that forces
investing in the relationship.

361
00:21:00,446 --> 00:21:02,274
<i>- Okay. Thank you very much.</i>
- You're welcome.

362
00:21:02,417 --> 00:21:06,500
Up next is an inspiring young woman
named Clarisse Iribagiza,

363
00:21:06,502 --> 00:21:08,805
who started her company
while still in university

364
00:21:08,806 --> 00:21:10,601
in the year 2010.

365
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:14,692
This was a time when access to information
was a big problem in Rwanda.

366
00:21:14,693 --> 00:21:17,843
On the other hand,
high levels of mobile penetration

367
00:21:17,844 --> 00:21:21,655
with over 90 % of the population
having access to mobile phones

368
00:21:21,656 --> 00:21:24,333
presented a huge opportunity.

369
00:21:24,334 --> 00:21:26,983
With HeHe Labs, Ltd, Clarisse created

370
00:21:26,984 --> 00:21:29,786
a content and feedback
management application,

371
00:21:29,792 --> 00:21:33,615
first via SMS and now
via smartphone applications.

372
00:21:33,616 --> 00:21:37,009
The system leveraged
existing infrastructure

373
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,955
by letting people receive new information
on devices they already owned.

374
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:44,063
Clarisse doesn't mention that here,

375
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:46,827
but they actually lost
one of HeHe Labs' early clients

376
00:21:46,828 --> 00:21:50,187
when the client themselves
lost their license to operate.

377
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:52,775
This was a huge blow to her team's morale

378
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:55,625
as that particular client
had brought a lot of optimism

379
00:21:55,626 --> 00:21:57,066
and income to the venture.

380
00:21:57,677 --> 00:22:01,368
Needless to say, HeHe Labs
recovered and has moved on.

381
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:03,245
Clarisse's story shows

382
00:22:03,246 --> 00:22:07,847
just how unpredictable and exciting
the entrepreneurial journey can be.

383
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,283
(chattering children)

384
00:22:14,979 --> 00:22:16,770
(sound of a passing car)

385
00:22:20,806 --> 00:22:23,101
Well, my name is Clarisse Iribagiza.

386
00:22:23,102 --> 00:22:26,884
I'm 26 years old. I'm a computer engineer.

387
00:22:27,592 --> 00:22:30,611
<i>(interviewer) Okay.
Please tell us about your venture.</i>

388
00:22:32,422 --> 00:22:34,871
HeHe Labs is a mobile
technologies company.

389
00:22:34,872 --> 00:22:37,144
We're almost five years old now.

390
00:22:37,145 --> 00:22:39,516
We've been building
mobile information systems

391
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:41,465
across East Africa,

392
00:22:41,466 --> 00:22:46,802
in the sectors of agriculture, healthcare,
transportation, and education.

393
00:22:47,602 --> 00:22:48,721
<i>(interviewer) Beautiful!</i>

394
00:22:48,722 --> 00:22:51,375
<i>What attracted you
to starting your own business?</i>

395
00:22:53,962 --> 00:22:56,162
When we founded HeHe Labs,

396
00:22:56,163 --> 00:23:00,493
I was part of a college group
that was working on a project.

397
00:23:00,494 --> 00:23:04,341
We were just really inspired
by the ability to impact change

398
00:23:04,342 --> 00:23:06,581
with the skill set that we had.

399
00:23:06,582 --> 00:23:10,867
Given the environment that we were in
that really encouraged entrepreneurship,

400
00:23:10,868 --> 00:23:13,062
it was quite easy for us to get started.

401
00:23:13,962 --> 00:23:16,481
(chattering children)

402
00:23:21,469 --> 00:23:24,960
I never quite imagine myself
becoming an entrepreneur

403
00:23:24,961 --> 00:23:27,719
in the context of founding a company.

404
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,251
But as a child, I always worked on
different projects

405
00:23:31,252 --> 00:23:34,361
to sort of solve whatever problem
I saw around myself.

406
00:23:34,362 --> 00:23:40,447
Maybe it was a class project or something
with my friends, with my family.

407
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:43,086
I was always around
just building solutions.

408
00:23:43,087 --> 00:23:45,698
That's what I define as entrepreneurship.

409
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,060
(noise of cars passing)

410
00:23:56,566 --> 00:23:59,343
I would say that we're
in the mobile technology space

411
00:23:59,344 --> 00:24:02,200
because when it comes to
information technologies,

412
00:24:02,201 --> 00:24:05,485
we believe that it's a great opportunity

413
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:08,926
to connect people to information.

414
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:11,389
We know that information is empowering.

415
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:17,219
When it comes to leveraging
the mobile phone as a platform

416
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:18,996
for delivering our services,

417
00:24:18,997 --> 00:24:23,603
I would say that it's as basic
as the fact that a lot of Rwandans

418
00:24:23,604 --> 00:24:28,320
have access to a mobile device
close to 70%.

419
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:31,039
It's pretty much the easiest way

420
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,936
to get to the last man
and to get to the last mile

421
00:24:33,937 --> 00:24:37,870
when delivering the information
that we need for people to access.

422
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:41,372
(cars honking, children chattering)

423
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:51,481
I think the one skill that's needed really

424
00:24:51,482 --> 00:24:54,482
is just the willingness to learn.

425
00:24:54,504 --> 00:24:57,473
A lot of what we do even as a business is

426
00:24:57,474 --> 00:25:01,446
we're always trying out new things
so we need to learn every single day.

427
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:06,811
I think that the ability to learn
new things was what stood out for me

428
00:25:06,812 --> 00:25:09,692
as an ability to help me become
an entrepreneur.

429
00:25:11,607 --> 00:25:13,695
<i>(interviewer)
Did you develop other skills</i>

430
00:25:13,696 --> 00:25:15,348
<i>as you were building the business?</i>

431
00:25:16,028 --> 00:25:18,211
I did develop a lot of other skills,

432
00:25:19,169 --> 00:25:23,481
skills around leadership, collaboration,
business development

433
00:25:24,321 --> 00:25:28,854
as well as technical skills
that include finance

434
00:25:28,855 --> 00:25:31,981
and other things around product design,

435
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:35,189
which I've come to pick up along the way.

436
00:25:35,819 --> 00:25:37,951
(sound of passing cars)

437
00:25:44,259 --> 00:25:46,269
<i>(interviewer) Did you face any challenges?</i>

438
00:25:47,355 --> 00:25:50,723
Yes. I have faced a couple of challenges

439
00:25:50,735 --> 00:25:57,224
mostly because we've pretty much
been doing new things

440
00:25:57,225 --> 00:25:59,578
every single day here at HeHe Labs.

441
00:26:01,176 --> 00:26:06,228
Most of our challenges include
just figuring out what's next –

442
00:26:06,229 --> 00:26:07,939
that's always difficult –

443
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,574
finding the resources to make it happen,

444
00:26:11,815 --> 00:26:14,725
working in an environment
where some of the ideas

445
00:26:14,726 --> 00:26:16,763
that we have are relatively new

446
00:26:16,764 --> 00:26:21,114
so just getting people to believe
in our products and use them.

447
00:26:21,115 --> 00:26:23,407
Those are some
of the challenges that we face.

448
00:26:24,521 --> 00:26:27,326
Let's go back to the idea
of the entrepreneurial mindset,

449
00:26:27,327 --> 00:26:30,265
which is the willingness
to see opportunity

450
00:26:30,266 --> 00:26:33,302
in uncertain and rapidly
changing conditions.

451
00:26:33,918 --> 00:26:36,710
Stone Atwine, our next entrepreneur,

452
00:26:36,735 --> 00:26:38,986
will tell you about
how he saw opportunity

453
00:26:38,987 --> 00:26:42,152
in a problem faced by his grandmother;

454
00:26:42,366 --> 00:26:44,487
the difficulty of receiving money.

455
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:48,754
While others may have looked at
the situation and seen bank fees,

456
00:26:48,755 --> 00:26:51,662
complex regulations as chaos,

457
00:26:51,663 --> 00:26:54,213
Stone and his team saw this area

458
00:26:54,214 --> 00:26:57,336
as representing a problem
that needed to be solved

459
00:26:57,337 --> 00:27:00,613
and a problem that had
a lot of value behind it.

460
00:27:01,933 --> 00:27:04,276
The interesting thing about
the entrepreneurial mindset

461
00:27:04,277 --> 00:27:06,945
that Stone and his team exemplifies

462
00:27:06,946 --> 00:27:10,037
is that it's something
that doesn't just happen

463
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:12,557
at the beginning
of the entrepreneurial process.

464
00:27:12,558 --> 00:27:16,055
It's something that you'll need
throughout the experience.

465
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:21,959
As Stone and his team
developed the idea behind remit.ug,

466
00:27:21,984 --> 00:27:25,382
there were moments when he thought
they should close shop.

467
00:27:25,383 --> 00:27:28,465
He says, "OK, guys, can we wrap this up?"

468
00:27:29,355 --> 00:27:33,164
Luckily, Stone and his team
still saw value in what they were doing.

469
00:27:33,165 --> 00:27:36,856
They persevered
and they're still doing this today.

470
00:27:36,857 --> 00:27:38,411
An inspiration.

471
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:43,247
(chattering children)

472
00:27:51,950 --> 00:27:53,846
My name is Stone Atwine.

473
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:58,429
I'm 32 years old from Uganda.

474
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:02,211
I started computer science at school.

475
00:28:02,212 --> 00:28:04,055
I'm an entrepreneur.

476
00:28:05,541 --> 00:28:07,982
<i>(interviewer) Fantastic!
Tell us about your venture.</i>

477
00:28:08,809 --> 00:28:14,084
What we've done is we've built
a web-based platform, remit.ug,

478
00:28:14,085 --> 00:28:17,788
which helps people in the diaspora

479
00:28:17,789 --> 00:28:22,939
or people all over the world
to send money from their cards,

480
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:26,855
that's Visa and MasterCard,
to mobile money in Africa.

481
00:28:27,184 --> 00:28:31,869
We've started with Uganda,
delivery into Uganda.

482
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:39,559
Initially, I had this idea
to transfer money back home

483
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:42,969
from the diaspora,
from all over the world.

484
00:28:43,314 --> 00:28:46,984
I noticed that there was--

485
00:28:47,774 --> 00:28:50,773
their current system was broken

486
00:28:50,774 --> 00:28:55,333
in terms of it's very inconvenient,
and it's expensive.

487
00:28:56,095 --> 00:28:59,856
I had this idea and I knew
I couldn't do it alone,

488
00:28:59,857 --> 00:29:03,668
so initially, I shared it
with a friend of mine,

489
00:29:03,918 --> 00:29:06,168
Teddy Ruge.

490
00:29:07,109 --> 00:29:11,751
At that point, I was living in Nairobi.
I was working in Nairobi,

491
00:29:12,097 --> 00:29:14,726
and Teddy was living in Texas.

492
00:29:16,204 --> 00:29:22,635
Because he had all these connections
with the diaspora and was working,

493
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:27,142
doing work along those lines,
I chose to tell him.

494
00:29:27,143 --> 00:29:31,811
What was interesting is
when I told Teddy about my idea,

495
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:35,659
he told me that he also had
the same idea

496
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,697
and was actually facing the same problem,

497
00:29:37,698 --> 00:29:40,557
that same challenge
of sending money home from the US.

498
00:29:41,254 --> 00:29:46,181
He actually sent me his notes
that he had drawn up from before.

499
00:29:48,751 --> 00:29:51,425
Basically, we were both
trying to do the same thing.

500
00:29:51,609 --> 00:29:54,509
We said, "OK, we're going to try
and find some money and do this,"

501
00:29:54,674 --> 00:29:56,350
but we share little bit.

502
00:29:56,351 --> 00:29:59,058
Then at the beginning of 2013,

503
00:29:59,059 --> 00:30:04,988
I came back home from Nairobi to stay.

504
00:30:05,058 --> 00:30:12,038
At that point, Teddy was
also actually in Uganda.

505
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,587
One evening, I was hanging out
talking to a guy.

506
00:30:16,596 --> 00:30:22,925
We're just talking about
the local tech ecosystem,

507
00:30:23,817 --> 00:30:25,490
another friend called Collin.

508
00:30:25,682 --> 00:30:28,194
I told him that we want
to do this, me and Teddy,

509
00:30:28,256 --> 00:30:33,380
we want to do something
along money transfer.

510
00:30:35,951 --> 00:30:39,843
Collin goes like, "Hey,
we've actually been talking about this."

511
00:30:39,852 --> 00:30:44,304
Collin has had
this other gentleman, David.

512
00:30:44,305 --> 00:30:49,242
They had also been planning
on building something like this.

513
00:30:49,243 --> 00:30:51,542
Actually, they already had a prototype.

514
00:30:51,543 --> 00:30:53,903
These are four people.

515
00:30:53,904 --> 00:30:57,086
All of us just by coincidence,
we talked about doing the same thing.

516
00:30:57,087 --> 00:30:59,276
Each of us has done a lot about it.

517
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:04,384
Essentially, I called up Teddy
that evening. We sat down.

518
00:31:04,485 --> 00:31:09,530
One hour later, we had agreed
to act together.

519
00:31:10,145 --> 00:31:13,310
Within the next week,

520
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:16,206
we had just set the company
and gotten everything done.

521
00:31:18,326 --> 00:31:21,972
We continued and built
a minimum viable product.

522
00:31:23,325 --> 00:31:26,305
We've been testing, and now
we are ready for the big turn.

523
00:31:27,028 --> 00:31:29,232
(sound of passing cars)

524
00:31:36,573 --> 00:31:41,621
We saw the need to do this,
to start this company

525
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:43,716
because one,

526
00:31:44,881 --> 00:31:48,856
is we were actually facing
this problem ourselves.

527
00:31:52,023 --> 00:31:54,946
Then you sit down and think and say...
in my case, I'm like,

528
00:31:55,151 --> 00:31:59,511
"Why is it so hard to send
money to my grandmother?

529
00:31:59,512 --> 00:32:02,446
I mean it shouldn't be this hard."

530
00:32:03,167 --> 00:32:06,501
Because I was in Nairobi, there was M-Pesa.

531
00:32:06,514 --> 00:32:10,919
There was mobile money in Uganda.

532
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:16,970
The first thing was, "How come
these two networks can't talk

533
00:32:16,971 --> 00:32:20,120
so I can't send this money as easy
as when I'm in Uganda?"

534
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:23,732
Actually, initially,
what I used to do is I would ask,

535
00:32:24,321 --> 00:32:28,419
I'd do a bank transfer
to a friend of mine in Uganda.

536
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:34,210
My friend would pull out the money
and put it in my Ugandan mobile money.

537
00:32:34,211 --> 00:32:37,053
Then I would send it
to my grandmother, so it was hectic

538
00:32:37,054 --> 00:32:39,723
because my grandmother
is not interested in the banks,

539
00:32:39,774 --> 00:32:41,094
and all that stuff.

540
00:32:41,362 --> 00:32:43,528
She didn't even have access to the banks.

541
00:32:43,529 --> 00:32:48,578
It was mostly because of the struggle.

542
00:32:49,829 --> 00:32:52,917
Then seeing the solution and saying,

543
00:32:52,918 --> 00:32:56,864
"Oh, we could actually use
mobile to pull this off."

544
00:32:57,088 --> 00:32:59,768
Starting this was essentially

545
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:05,809
because we were suffering
from this problem of transferring money.

546
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:08,843
Then you sit down and say,
"Ah, it's out of necessity."

547
00:33:08,961 --> 00:33:12,031
Then we were like, "We can actually
make money out of this.

548
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:17,536
We'd actually start a business
and in the process help people."

549
00:33:17,673 --> 00:33:19,898
I remember in the beginning
when we were starting,

550
00:33:19,899 --> 00:33:23,879
we were looking for a lot
of information about remittances

551
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:25,930
and this business of money transfer.

552
00:33:25,931 --> 00:33:28,405
We read reports from the World Bank,

553
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:33,873
from the African Development Bank,
from various NGOs.

554
00:33:33,874 --> 00:33:36,252
They were all pointing to the fact

555
00:33:36,253 --> 00:33:41,593
that the current money
transfer system is very expensive.

556
00:33:41,594 --> 00:33:43,108
It's very inconvenient.

557
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:47,829
It was almost a dual point
like two big guys who do this.

558
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:49,105
They're charging you.

559
00:33:49,106 --> 00:33:51,637
I mean moving money
from Johannesburg to Kampala

560
00:33:51,638 --> 00:33:55,712
could cost up to 20%
of the money you're trying to move.

561
00:33:55,713 --> 00:34:00,733
If you're trying to move $200,
you could end up paying $40, $34.

562
00:34:00,734 --> 00:34:03,564
If you're moving $100, you could pay $18.

563
00:34:05,245 --> 00:34:06,579
That's how we started.

564
00:34:06,752 --> 00:34:10,087
We sat down. We looked at
the costs of sending money.

565
00:34:10,088 --> 00:34:15,623
We said we could actually put
only one fee.

566
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:20,292
Our fee is just one 5.4% and charge that.

567
00:34:20,293 --> 00:34:23,384
It will be much, much easier.

568
00:34:23,385 --> 00:34:28,245
We bring down the cost
on the persons we're helping--

569
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:32,010
we're helping both
the senders and the recipients

570
00:34:32,011 --> 00:34:35,739
because they get more money
in their pockets.

571
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:40,041
<i>(interviewer) It's 1.5% that you take?</i>

572
00:34:40,043 --> 00:34:41,081
- Us?
- Yeah.

573
00:34:41,081 --> 00:34:42,641
- 5.4%.
<i>-Oh 5.4.</i>

574
00:34:42,643 --> 00:34:46,362
5.4%. We really want to bring this down.

575
00:34:46,362 --> 00:34:52,101
The reason we charge 5.4%--
we think it's high still,

576
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:56,360
but we have challenges
with like card transfer.

577
00:34:56,362 --> 00:34:58,263
(man chattering)

578
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:06,085
I'm not sure.

579
00:35:06,092 --> 00:35:09,254
I guess it was the need

580
00:35:10,754 --> 00:35:16,189
to solve problems
that people I see every day face.

581
00:35:16,488 --> 00:35:20,688
Beyond that, right from
when I was a young guy,

582
00:35:20,689 --> 00:35:23,984
I was like building things.
I like building things.

583
00:35:23,985 --> 00:35:27,345
Building things, I'm solving problems.

584
00:35:29,064 --> 00:35:32,314
I guess it's something
that I was meant to do.

585
00:35:32,315 --> 00:35:35,604
And the need to help people.

586
00:35:36,327 --> 00:35:39,452
(chattering children)

587
00:35:44,664 --> 00:35:48,243
The skills that make
a successful entrepreneur,

588
00:35:48,244 --> 00:35:52,016
I think you really have to have
a lot of endurance.

589
00:35:52,017 --> 00:35:56,282
You have to have grit, not give up.

590
00:35:56,283 --> 00:35:58,780
You have to understand
what you're doing.

591
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,464
You have to manage to people.
That's very critical.

592
00:36:02,981 --> 00:36:08,173
But I guess the most important thing
is the need to build things

593
00:36:08,322 --> 00:36:11,474
and the capacity to stay that course

594
00:36:11,475 --> 00:36:16,302
and make sure you follow through
all the time, every time.

595
00:36:17,248 --> 00:36:20,073
(truck breaks screeching)

596
00:36:27,688 --> 00:36:31,744
The advice is to really start.
You have to go out there.

597
00:36:31,745 --> 00:36:33,002
You have to start.

598
00:36:33,003 --> 00:36:35,992
I mean you could have
all these plans and dreams.

599
00:36:36,234 --> 00:36:40,811
But if you don't take
the first step of starting,

600
00:36:40,812 --> 00:36:42,852
then you're not going to go anywhere.

601
00:36:43,315 --> 00:36:47,527
It is go out there, start, try, and see.

602
00:36:47,528 --> 00:36:50,075
You're going to fail,
maybe you're going to do it,

603
00:36:50,076 --> 00:36:51,808
but you have to start.

604
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:57,516
The biggest challenge that entrepreneurs,
potential entrepreneurs face,

605
00:36:57,517 --> 00:37:00,694
I think in Africa
is not being able to find money.

606
00:37:04,171 --> 00:37:06,180
But you could start.

607
00:37:06,181 --> 00:37:10,778
I mean when we started,
we also didn't have all this money.

608
00:37:10,779 --> 00:37:12,174
We didn't have money at all.

609
00:37:12,175 --> 00:37:14,274
But we said, "We're going to do it.
We're going to do it."

610
00:37:14,275 --> 00:37:15,834
We started it.

611
00:37:15,835 --> 00:37:18,213
The next thing is that you must speak.

612
00:37:18,214 --> 00:37:23,350
I mean the challenges
we faced with remit...

613
00:37:23,786 --> 00:37:28,150
Sometimes, you're like,
"OK, guys, can we wrap this up?"

614
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:32,150
Then you say,
"But we've done so much work.

615
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:35,095
Let's try. Let's try.
Let's push. Let's move forward."

616
00:37:35,204 --> 00:37:38,036
You go here. You borrow
money to bring it in.

617
00:37:38,037 --> 00:37:41,955
You borrow from family, from friends.

618
00:37:41,956 --> 00:37:48,071
Really, it is sticking to the business
until you reach a point

619
00:37:48,072 --> 00:37:52,071
where you realize that
you're going to make it.

620
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,333
You make a decision and you say,

621
00:37:54,334 --> 00:37:56,291
"We're not going to make it,
let's close shop."

622
00:37:56,292 --> 00:38:02,251
But really, the biggest piece of advice
is to start and to stick to the business,

623
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:05,431
and work extremely hard
because you're going to work.

624
00:38:05,432 --> 00:38:08,592
You're not going to get paid
for a very long time.

625
00:38:08,593 --> 00:38:10,934
Up to today, we don't get paid.

626
00:38:11,593 --> 00:38:14,434
So it's a huge, huge challenge.

627
00:38:16,129 --> 00:38:17,578
The money issue is a problem.

628
00:38:17,933 --> 00:38:20,379
It's a big problem
because you have a team of guys

629
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:22,991
who have been working now
for almost a year.

630
00:38:25,494 --> 00:38:31,154
If we were sitting down
and working on this every single day,

631
00:38:31,190 --> 00:38:33,098
we would be much farther.

632
00:38:33,099 --> 00:38:38,071
We have to go and find money,

633
00:38:38,229 --> 00:38:42,873
which we can actually bring in
to help the company.

634
00:38:42,874 --> 00:38:46,025
We don't take a salary
because we don't have money.

635
00:38:46,026 --> 00:38:49,052
Every little money we make,
we put back into the company.

636
00:38:49,053 --> 00:38:52,658
Because of that, we also have
to actually work on the side

637
00:38:52,659 --> 00:38:54,305
to get some money.

638
00:38:54,306 --> 00:38:56,563
It's a challenge,

639
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:03,026
but you just have to push
and push and push and push.

640
00:39:03,192 --> 00:39:04,664
You don't give up.

641
00:39:05,941 --> 00:39:08,442
Our final entrepreneur for this week
helps us better understand

642
00:39:08,443 --> 00:39:11,100
the idea of the entrepreneurial event.

643
00:39:11,101 --> 00:39:14,314
One of the challenges
of studying entrepreneurship

644
00:39:14,315 --> 00:39:16,661
is the difference in every one's journey.

645
00:39:16,662 --> 00:39:20,955
Some people quit their job
and immediately register a new venture,

646
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:24,281
which creates a public record
of the founding of the company.

647
00:39:24,282 --> 00:39:28,122
Others work for years,
on nights and weekends

648
00:39:28,123 --> 00:39:31,007
until they are confident enough
about their venture

649
00:39:31,008 --> 00:39:35,542
before deciding to quit their job
and register the company.

650
00:39:35,902 --> 00:39:38,765
Samir's decision to jump into
the entrepreneurial lifestyle

651
00:39:38,766 --> 00:39:40,943
seems a very clear cut.

652
00:39:40,944 --> 00:39:43,329
It might not be the same for you.

653
00:39:44,602 --> 00:39:47,121
The second thing to observe
about Samir's story

654
00:39:47,122 --> 00:39:52,581
is how he transferred knowledge
from Kenya to the US and back to Kenya

655
00:39:52,582 --> 00:39:56,322
and is constantly trying to absorb
new information like a sponge.

656
00:39:57,768 --> 00:40:01,181
When you're offering
a specific product, in a specific place,

657
00:40:01,182 --> 00:40:03,719
but with different cultures and habits,

658
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:06,701
making false assumptions
could kill your venture.

659
00:40:06,702 --> 00:40:08,633
Let's hear more on this from Samir.

660
00:40:09,262 --> 00:40:11,427
(chattering children)

661
00:40:20,182 --> 00:40:22,867
My name is Samir Ibrahim. I'm 26.

662
00:40:23,062 --> 00:40:26,756
My background is in finance
and international business.

663
00:40:27,522 --> 00:40:30,210
<i>(interviewer) Perfect.
Tell us about your venture.</i>

664
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:32,918
Our company is called SunCulture.

665
00:40:32,942 --> 00:40:35,932
We design and sell solar-powered
irrigation systems

666
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,242
that make it cheaper and easier
for farmers to grow food.

667
00:40:39,558 --> 00:40:42,785
We got here in May, 2013.

668
00:40:42,856 --> 00:40:45,178
Actually, we got here in October, 2012.

669
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:49,211
Since then, we have helped
hundreds of farmers across Kenya,

670
00:40:49,212 --> 00:40:53,116
improved their lives by growing
high value fresh fruits and vegetables.

671
00:40:56,197 --> 00:40:57,417
(chattering children)

672
00:41:04,475 --> 00:41:08,364
Yes. Since I was a little kid,
I've always wanted to be an entrepreneur.

673
00:41:08,998 --> 00:41:10,245
It's always been in my family.

674
00:41:10,301 --> 00:41:14,655
I always said I'm going to actually
come back to the region and do something.

675
00:41:15,820 --> 00:41:18,822
I'd always sold books on the side.

676
00:41:19,736 --> 00:41:23,532
Little ventures on the side
while you're young is always fun,

677
00:41:23,533 --> 00:41:26,975
sort of like the stereotypical
lemonade stand.

678
00:41:27,538 --> 00:41:31,578
It's exciting to have made
that move. It's very fulfilling.

679
00:41:32,880 --> 00:41:35,289
(children chattering)

680
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:46,273
My family has always been
small business owners and entrepreneurs.

681
00:41:46,533 --> 00:41:50,137
When my co-founder and friend,
Charlie, approached me with this idea,

682
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:52,935
we decided it was the right time
to make the jump.

683
00:41:52,936 --> 00:41:54,794
Charlie had started
a few companies before.

684
00:41:54,795 --> 00:41:58,271
I was looking for a way to escape

685
00:41:58,272 --> 00:42:01,047
the corporate America life
that I was living.

686
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:03,662
It made sense at the time
and very happy we did it.

687
00:42:04,076 --> 00:42:06,017
<i>(interviewer) What elements
of entrepreneurship</i>

688
00:42:06,018 --> 00:42:08,889
<i>really sort of stood out to you
to be attractive in that way?</i>

689
00:42:10,488 --> 00:42:12,494
The way we look at it
is that everything great

690
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:16,497
that's ever happened in the world
started from someone starting something.

691
00:42:17,047 --> 00:42:20,002
We figure if we wanted to make
some impact somehow, somewhere,

692
00:42:20,003 --> 00:42:21,726
we had to start something ourselves.

693
00:42:22,214 --> 00:42:26,457
That's the most attractive thing for us
is we can shape the way our company works.

694
00:42:26,458 --> 00:42:29,760
We can actually live our dream
and live our vision the way we want to.

695
00:42:29,894 --> 00:42:31,871
(children chattering)

696
00:42:37,957 --> 00:42:40,282
I don't think anybody knows
if they have the right skills

697
00:42:40,283 --> 00:42:41,524
to become an entrepreneur.

698
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:43,312
I don't know if there's a skill set

699
00:42:43,313 --> 00:42:46,081
that makes a good entrepreneur,
makes a bad entrepreneur.

700
00:42:46,082 --> 00:42:49,509
I think having a mindset
where no matter what,

701
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:50,694
you're not going to give up.

702
00:42:50,695 --> 00:42:53,118
That resilience is something
that everyone one should have.

703
00:42:53,146 --> 00:42:55,631
I'm not really sure if that's something
that you're born with.

704
00:42:55,632 --> 00:42:58,510
It can be developed. I'm not sure.

705
00:42:58,511 --> 00:43:00,641
But it's something that's really important.

706
00:43:00,642 --> 00:43:02,771
I think anybody
that wants to be an entrepreneur

707
00:43:02,772 --> 00:43:05,278
should try and should keep pushing.

708
00:43:05,279 --> 00:43:07,255
Because if they really believe
in something

709
00:43:07,256 --> 00:43:09,754
and if you really want to do something
for yourself, it's possible.

710
00:43:09,755 --> 00:43:11,043
It's always possible.

711
00:43:11,044 --> 00:43:13,561
You just have to keep crawling
through all the obstacles.

712
00:43:13,562 --> 00:43:15,022
And It'll be OK.

713
00:43:15,414 --> 00:43:17,781
<i>(interviewer) I feel like
you're playing down a little bit</i>

714
00:43:17,782 --> 00:43:20,038
<i>the kind of skills you do need
to have an entrepreneur.</i>

715
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:22,334
<i>At least we'd like characteristics.</i>

716
00:43:22,855 --> 00:43:26,084
<i>If you were to sort of say like
what are the things you need</i>

717
00:43:26,085 --> 00:43:29,991
<i>to be cognizant of,
in terms of business and apply it?</i>

718
00:43:29,992 --> 00:43:31,968
Sure. That's a good question.

719
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:37,659
The money, you need money skills
to be an entrepreneur.

720
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:39,064
If you don't have money skills,

721
00:43:39,065 --> 00:43:41,314
find someone who can help you
with money skills.

722
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:44,050
You or your co-founder
or somebody in your team

723
00:43:44,051 --> 00:43:45,870
has to be able to manage people.

724
00:43:46,094 --> 00:43:48,976
Then you or your co-founder
or somebody in your team

725
00:43:49,085 --> 00:43:52,435
needs to be able to handle the
technical side of whatever you're doing.

726
00:43:54,451 --> 00:43:57,914
Taking a step back,
the reason why I think we're so lucky

727
00:43:58,303 --> 00:44:01,547
is that Charlie and I come
from two separate backgrounds.

728
00:44:01,622 --> 00:44:03,934
We have two very complementary skill sets.

729
00:44:04,192 --> 00:44:08,505
I come from a very finance
and international business side of things

730
00:44:08,561 --> 00:44:10,475
and Charlie comes from very technical...

731
00:44:10,683 --> 00:44:12,264
- he's a mechanical engineer by training -

732
00:44:12,265 --> 00:44:14,001
large scale solar installations.

733
00:44:14,002 --> 00:44:17,692
We have two very defined hard skills
that when put together,

734
00:44:17,693 --> 00:44:19,272
we can kind of handle everything.

735
00:44:19,419 --> 00:44:22,774
I think that's something really important,
and not a lot of entrepreneurs realizes

736
00:44:22,775 --> 00:44:25,053
you need people in your team
to cover everything.

737
00:44:25,054 --> 00:44:27,674
You don't need to do it yourself,
but you need to have people in your team

738
00:44:27,675 --> 00:44:31,197
who have the skills necessary
to execute what you're trying to do.

739
00:44:31,938 --> 00:44:33,229
When you start a business,

740
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:36,647
you're never prepared
for the skills you'll need.

741
00:44:37,244 --> 00:44:39,312
We don't come from
agriculture backgrounds.

742
00:44:39,983 --> 00:44:42,099
We know everything
about agriculture right now.

743
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:45,233
It's those things where you have
to pick up hard skills along the way.

744
00:44:45,234 --> 00:44:48,104
I think the most important skill
that we had to learn along the way

745
00:44:48,105 --> 00:44:52,208
is to manage the emotional rollercoaster
that we go through on a daily basis.

746
00:44:52,419 --> 00:44:55,093
I think that's something
that if I can go back a few years

747
00:44:55,094 --> 00:44:56,664
and tell a younger Samir,

748
00:44:56,665 --> 00:44:59,588
"This is something you need
to know before you start this

749
00:44:59,589 --> 00:45:03,097
is that you're going to have
ups and downs on a daily basis.

750
00:45:03,098 --> 00:45:05,982
You need to be able to manage that.
Otherwise, it'll eat you up."

751
00:45:05,983 --> 00:45:08,221
That's actually the most difficult thing.

752
00:45:08,959 --> 00:45:11,481
(chattering children)

753
00:45:16,606 --> 00:45:19,936
There have been a lot of challenges
we've had to face.

754
00:45:19,937 --> 00:45:24,582
Like I said, the number one challenge
in one that you're not always prepared for

755
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:27,281
is how to manage your own
psychological state.

756
00:45:27,282 --> 00:45:31,397
Being an entrepreneur
is difficult. It's also very fulfilling.

757
00:45:32,093 --> 00:45:36,406
Every decision you make directly impacts
the success of your company.

758
00:45:37,020 --> 00:45:41,371
Every decision you make directly affects
a lot of other people as well.

759
00:45:41,372 --> 00:45:42,715
There's a lot of stress.

760
00:45:42,716 --> 00:45:46,269
But if you can manage the stress
and come to an understanding

761
00:45:46,270 --> 00:45:49,558
you're doing this because you love it
and remind yourself that sometimes,

762
00:45:49,559 --> 00:45:51,255
then it's extremely fulfilling.

763
00:45:51,256 --> 00:45:52,954
That's the most difficult thing.

764
00:45:52,955 --> 00:45:56,547
Learning to manage it better
is very helpful.

765
00:45:58,672 --> 00:45:59,954
Yeah.

766
00:46:00,077 --> 00:46:01,451
<i>(interviewer) No other challenges?</i>

767
00:46:01,452 --> 00:46:03,504
There a lot of other challenges.

768
00:46:03,709 --> 00:46:07,371
Starting a company with a new technology

769
00:46:07,372 --> 00:46:10,436
in a fairly nascent agricultural market,
in a new country for us,

770
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:11,940
comes with lots of challenges.

771
00:46:11,941 --> 00:46:15,576
Dealing with the operation nuances
of bringing goods into the port,

772
00:46:15,667 --> 00:46:17,736
or understanding tax law,

773
00:46:17,737 --> 00:46:20,940
understanding what drives people
in different part of the world,

774
00:46:20,941 --> 00:46:23,850
understanding how to sell to people
in different parts of the world;

775
00:46:23,851 --> 00:46:25,349
it's tough.

776
00:46:25,350 --> 00:46:29,019
You can't come to a new country

777
00:46:29,020 --> 00:46:31,288
and launch a business
with the same mentality

778
00:46:31,289 --> 00:46:33,547
that you had when you were back
where you were before,

779
00:46:33,548 --> 00:46:34,827
we were in New York.

780
00:46:34,905 --> 00:46:38,183
People are different.
What drives people is different.

781
00:46:38,184 --> 00:46:42,023
The way business is done,
the formalities, all different.

782
00:46:42,024 --> 00:46:43,939
You have to be very flexible,
and very open,

783
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:46,061
and not have too big of a head

784
00:46:46,062 --> 00:46:49,080
where you come to a place
and think you know everything;

785
00:46:49,081 --> 00:46:50,209
because you don't.

786
00:46:50,210 --> 00:46:52,928
You have to be able and willing
to learn the new things that come

787
00:46:52,929 --> 00:46:54,891
with starting a company in a new country.

788
00:46:55,037 --> 00:46:57,135
That's something that's challenging.

789
00:46:57,136 --> 00:46:59,600
If you allow yourself
to sort of you sponge

790
00:46:59,601 --> 00:47:02,151
and absorb a lot of information,
then you'll be fine.

791
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:06,500
<i>- Okay, just be a sponge.</i>
- Just be a sponge.

792
00:47:06,501 --> 00:47:09,420
- <i>Easy. You make it sound so easy.</i>
- That will be the tagline.

793
00:47:11,593 --> 00:47:15,429
Nairobi is such a concentrated pool
of awesome people.

794
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:18,959
Working in an environment
where there are so many people

795
00:47:18,968 --> 00:47:22,361
who are shooting for such amazing goals,

796
00:47:22,362 --> 00:47:27,212
it gives us an opportunity to
bounce ideas off to people very closely.

797
00:47:27,484 --> 00:47:31,112
The sort of starting community
here is very tight.

798
00:47:31,600 --> 00:47:36,688
It makes working here much easier
because you can speak to people

799
00:47:36,689 --> 00:47:39,679
about the problems you're going through
and the challenges that you have.

800
00:47:39,680 --> 00:47:42,050
You always have peers
to bounce things off a bit.

801
00:47:42,051 --> 00:47:44,778
It really helps you
when you're starting a company.

802
00:47:45,536 --> 00:47:49,702
I hope you found those interviews
insightful and inspiring.

803
00:47:49,703 --> 00:47:51,017
In the next few weeks,

804
00:47:51,018 --> 00:47:54,336
we'll be talking with more entrepreneurs
about their experiences

805
00:47:54,337 --> 00:47:58,364
with opportunity identification,
understanding their customer,

806
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,709
marketing, fundraising,
and growing their venture.

807
00:48:02,292 --> 00:48:06,894
Be sure to submit all
of your questions to us on Coursera,

808
00:48:06,895 --> 00:48:09,234
in the quiz that is provided

809
00:48:09,235 --> 00:48:12,945
because we're going to be hosting
live Google Hangout panels.

810
00:48:12,946 --> 00:48:16,422
We really want to make sure
that your questions get answered

811
00:48:16,423 --> 00:48:18,213
with our great panelists.

812
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:22,797
Thanks very much.
All the information is on the slide.
