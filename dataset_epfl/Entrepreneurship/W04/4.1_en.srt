1
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:09,439
Welcome back!

2
00:00:09,439 --> 00:00:11,640
This is segment 4.1 on 
"How much money do you need?".

3
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:14,235
In this segment we're going to
discuss financial projections.

4
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:15,849
We're going to talk about

5
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:18,504
when you need money
in the short run

6
00:00:18,504 --> 00:00:20,790
versus the medium term,
versus the long term;

7
00:00:21,371 --> 00:00:24,292
the sources of financing;

8
00:00:24,292 --> 00:00:27,194
and the appropriate time
to raise money.

9
00:00:27,446 --> 00:00:30,432
We'll go through a little bit
of financial accounting projections,

10
00:00:30,688 --> 00:00:33,908
and work on a five year
plan for your venture.

11
00:00:34,898 --> 00:00:38,732
Let's return to our graphic
that we started in the introduction.

12
00:00:39,141 --> 00:00:43,835
In this graphic, we're going to
look at the amount of money

13
00:00:43,835 --> 00:00:46,364
spent or gained over time.

14
00:00:47,251 --> 00:00:51,044
So, on the X axis we have
the passage of time,

15
00:00:51,168 --> 00:00:55,819
and on the Y axis we have
the total amount of money

16
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:58,160
that's available for the business.

17
00:00:58,726 --> 00:01:03,569
As we discussed previously,
the entrepreneur may start out above zero.

18
00:01:06,649 --> 00:01:10,935
Then, as the venture goes on,
the venture will spend money

19
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,336
and eventually start
making money

20
00:01:15,227 --> 00:01:17,248
and become profitable.

21
00:01:17,365 --> 00:01:20,941
Now, as we discussed,
the amount of money

22
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:25,635
that the venture needs will be
this total amount of money.

23
00:01:25,789 --> 00:01:30,277
On this graphic you can see
there's an inflection point right here.

24
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:35,993
This is the point at which the business
starts actually making money.

25
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:42,740
We're going to call this the point
that's "Cash Flow Positive".

26
00:01:44,011 --> 00:01:48,665
Then, at a later point in time,
the company makes enough money

27
00:01:48,665 --> 00:01:52,186
that it can pay off
all of it's prior expenditures,

28
00:01:52,339 --> 00:01:54,621
and that occurs right here.

29
00:01:54,843 --> 00:01:57,909
We're going to call this point
the "Break Even" point.

30
00:01:59,154 --> 00:02:01,743
As the venture passes
through different stages,

31
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:05,267
there are appropriate sources
for each stage

32
00:02:05,639 --> 00:02:08,423
and we're going to develop
those more in the next segment,

33
00:02:08,678 --> 00:02:11,659
but for now, we're going to talk
about what is the amount of money

34
00:02:11,659 --> 00:02:14,994
that you might need
in each stage over time.

35
00:02:15,451 --> 00:02:18,299
Now, you have to remember
that fundraising is not free.

36
00:02:18,694 --> 00:02:21,813
You may have to take out a loan
to fund your operations,

37
00:02:21,813 --> 00:02:25,111
in which case, you'll probably
pay interest on the loan.

38
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:29,080
Or, you may have to give up
an ownership share in the company

39
00:02:29,548 --> 00:02:31,347
to finance your operations.

40
00:02:31,833 --> 00:02:34,847
And, even if you can get
a gift or a donation

41
00:02:34,847 --> 00:02:37,089
or some other kind
of free and clear money

42
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:41,735
to finance your company,
you have to spend a lot of time

43
00:02:41,735 --> 00:02:47,129
to raise and service the people
that are giving you that money.

44
00:02:48,393 --> 00:02:50,699
So, even gifts take time.

45
00:02:52,976 --> 00:02:58,440
And finally, there's a limited
source of financing,

46
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:02,638
so you only have so many 
people that you can approach

47
00:03:02,929 --> 00:03:05,404
and you don't have
very many chances

48
00:03:05,404 --> 00:03:08,089
with each person or organization

49
00:03:08,089 --> 00:03:09,375
that you approach.

50
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:12,678
So, if you don't do it right
the first time,

51
00:03:12,678 --> 00:03:14,856
or if your approach
in the wrong stage,

52
00:03:15,165 --> 00:03:17,642
then you make it harder
to get the money that you need

53
00:03:17,642 --> 00:03:18,998
to finance your comapny.

54
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,491
So, that's why it's very
important to understand

55
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:24,330
how much money you need
at each stage of the game,

56
00:03:24,525 --> 00:03:26,944
and that's exactly what we're
going to talk about next.

57
00:03:27,348 --> 00:03:30,130
Let's look at an example
of an imaginary business.

58
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:33,894
This business is going
to have operations

59
00:03:33,894 --> 00:03:36,109
that's going to cost some
at the beginning,

60
00:03:36,109 --> 00:03:37,860
and eventually will
make money.

61
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:40,191
Let's look at a five
year projection.

62
00:03:41,413 --> 00:03:43,983
We're going to examine
the finances of this company

63
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:46,348
every year, for five years.

64
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:54,738
First, let's discuss
the gross revenues of this company.

65
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:57,829
This is all the receipts,
all the money the company

66
00:03:57,849 --> 00:03:59,892
makes top line.

67
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,516
In this particular case,
the company doesn't make

68
00:04:03,516 --> 00:04:05,436
any money in the first year.

69
00:04:06,078 --> 00:04:08,690
And then in the next year,
they make 50.

70
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:10,867
The following 100.

71
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:14,047
And then in year four,
they make 200.

72
00:04:14,659 --> 00:04:17,892
And in year five, they
finally make 400.

73
00:04:19,184 --> 00:04:22,668
Now, let's look at the gross
costs that this company has.

74
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,573
All of the costs associated
with doing business.

75
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:29,135
Now these are the gross
costs.

76
00:04:29,446 --> 00:04:32,743
They don't include a lot
of accounting details, such as

77
00:04:32,743 --> 00:04:37,295
interest, taxes, depreciation, 
and amortization.

78
00:04:37,755 --> 00:04:39,695
These are just the total
amount of gross costs,

79
00:04:40,307 --> 00:04:43,560
and in this particular case,
the company is going to start out

80
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,592
with 100 costs in year one,

81
00:04:47,224 --> 00:04:50,115
and it's going to rise
every year by 10.

82
00:04:50,115 --> 00:04:52,840
Now, we can develop
the profits for this company.

83
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:57,970
The profits, the gross profits
are simply the gross revenues

84
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,135
minus the gross costs.

85
00:05:01,191 --> 00:05:03,397
So, as you can see from
this example,

86
00:05:03,397 --> 00:05:06,758
we start out by losing
100.

87
00:05:07,392 --> 00:05:09,416
The next year
we lose 60.

88
00:05:09,813 --> 00:05:11,843
And in year three
we lose 20.

89
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:16,300
And finally, in year
four, we make 70.

90
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:19,585
And in year five,
we make 260.

91
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:25,756
So, year four would be the year
that we become cashflow positive.

92
00:05:27,629 --> 00:05:30,650
Now we're going to track
the cumulative amount

93
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,352
of money either lost or gained

94
00:05:33,352 --> 00:05:36,181
up through a certain point in time.

95
00:05:36,752 --> 00:05:38,819
So, what we'll do is we'll look
at the cumulative amount

96
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:41,397
gained through year one.

97
00:05:42,022 --> 00:05:46,199
In this particular case
it's going to be a loss of 100.

98
00:05:46,849 --> 00:05:51,781
Then in year two, we're going to have
an additional loss of 60.

99
00:05:52,122 --> 00:05:56,439
So the cumulative loss
will be 160.

100
00:05:58,078 --> 00:06:02,009
Finally, in year three,
we have another loss.

101
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:07,169
We lose 20 more, so now
we've cumulatively lost 180.

102
00:06:08,084 --> 00:06:12,044
And in year four,
we start making money.

103
00:06:12,044 --> 00:06:13,533
We're now cash 
flow positive.

104
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:18,939
So now, we reduce
our cumulative loss to 110.

105
00:06:20,417 --> 00:06:26,810
And then, finally, in year
five, we have made 260,

106
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:32,122
so that means our cumulative gains
are positive 150.

107
00:06:34,867 --> 00:06:39,630
At the point that we go
from a negative cumulative amount

108
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:45,205
to a positive cumulative amount,
is going to be the "Break Even" point.

109
00:06:47,169 --> 00:06:49,587
So, what we would say
about this business

110
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:55,310
is that they have reached
a cash flow positive in year four,

111
00:06:55,504 --> 00:06:58,615
and they've broken even in year five.

112
00:07:00,417 --> 00:07:04,562
So what I've done in this next slide
is I've typed it out.

113
00:07:05,262 --> 00:07:07,325
So I've just summarized
all of the information

114
00:07:07,325 --> 00:07:09,097
we just developed
on the prior slide,

115
00:07:09,603 --> 00:07:11,351
and now what we're going to do

116
00:07:11,351 --> 00:07:16,437
is simply highlight some key features
of this financial projection.

117
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:21,620
The first, as we mentioned before,
was the cash flow positive.

118
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,860
The second was the
"Break Even" point.

119
00:07:24,785 --> 00:07:26,423
Now there are a few other things

120
00:07:26,423 --> 00:07:27,941
that we should notice about this.

121
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:32,897
The first is how much money
you might need in each year.

122
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:36,913
So, in this particular case,
you could imagine

123
00:07:38,233 --> 00:07:40,509
needing about 100.

124
00:07:41,605 --> 00:07:45,534
I'm not saying what the units are here
on any of these figures.

125
00:07:46,058 --> 00:07:48,863
But, in this case, you'd need 100

126
00:07:48,863 --> 00:07:52,157
to be able to meet your obligations
for the first year.

127
00:07:52,442 --> 00:07:54,883
You may be able to finance part of that.

128
00:07:54,883 --> 00:07:56,808
If you recall from the first graph,

129
00:07:56,808 --> 00:07:58,650
sometimes you start
with some money

130
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:01,037
and you can spend down your money,

131
00:08:01,699 --> 00:08:04,551
so you may not need
to raise entirely 100 here.

132
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:09,333
Furthermore, you may be
able to cut costs,

133
00:08:10,457 --> 00:08:13,722
in which case, if you can cut
costs in that first year,

134
00:08:13,722 --> 00:08:16,700
you might be able
to get by with less money.

135
00:08:16,986 --> 00:08:20,008
So, this gives you some gross ideas

136
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:24,781
about how much you'd need
to finance each year.

137
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:29,957
Now, in year three, you see
the greatest cumulative loss

138
00:08:29,957 --> 00:08:31,583
is 180.

139
00:08:32,705 --> 00:08:35,119
So that, theoretically, is the amount

140
00:08:35,119 --> 00:08:37,626
that you're going to need
to raise eventually

141
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,528
to launch this business.

142
00:08:39,668 --> 00:08:41,512
Either that, or your need to cut costs

143
00:08:41,512 --> 00:08:43,885
or spend some of your initial sums.

144
00:08:44,069 --> 00:08:47,117
But that's the total resources
that you need for this company,

145
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:49,576
and then, eventually,
you'll start making money.

146
00:08:50,087 --> 00:08:52,124
And then you'll have to discuss later

147
00:08:52,124 --> 00:08:56,011
whether you need more money
for scaling up the business, etcetera.

148
00:08:56,918 --> 00:09:00,601
So, in summary,
for this segment we've covered

149
00:09:00,601 --> 00:09:04,393
how much money you might
need to launch your venture.

150
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:08,641
We discussed the stages 
of the venture

151
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:12,482
and how much you might
be expected to gain over time.

152
00:09:13,075 --> 00:09:15,776
We talked about financial
projections,

153
00:09:16,124 --> 00:09:20,269
gross revenues, costs, profits,
and the cumulative amount

154
00:09:20,269 --> 00:09:23,430
that you've gained or lost
at each point in time.
