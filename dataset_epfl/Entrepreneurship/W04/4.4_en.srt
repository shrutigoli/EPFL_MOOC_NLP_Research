1
00:00:08,174 --> 00:00:09,183
Welcome back!

2
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:12,841
This is segment 4.4 
on <i>Growth & expansion financing</i>.

3
00:00:12,841 --> 00:00:15,813
So today what we're going 
to do is talk a little bit,

4
00:00:15,813 --> 00:00:18,899
recap what we did before about the stages.

5
00:00:18,899 --> 00:00:20,879
We're going to give a little summary

6
00:00:20,879 --> 00:00:23,299
of how to analyze
your options for financing,

7
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:25,714
and then we're going 
to walk through step by step

8
00:00:25,714 --> 00:00:30,616
four different types of growth 
and expansion financing investors.

9
00:00:30,616 --> 00:00:31,775
So if you recall

10
00:00:31,775 --> 00:00:34,882
from the last several times
we've discussed this staging,

11
00:00:34,882 --> 00:00:40,608
and we talked about 
sort of the early stage of financing,

12
00:00:40,608 --> 00:00:43,377
and then we have 
sort of the later stages of financing.

13
00:00:44,082 --> 00:00:46,516
The first ones are the seed stage,

14
00:00:46,516 --> 00:00:48,691
or the start up stage.

15
00:00:48,691 --> 00:00:52,733
Some people think about the seed stage 
as being earlier than the start up stage

16
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:56,184
to help finance the initial cash outlays
of the business.

17
00:00:57,344 --> 00:00:59,387
Although some people, 
as I mentioned before,

18
00:00:59,387 --> 00:01:00,838
use them interchangeably.

19
00:01:00,838 --> 00:01:03,426
And the same thing 
for growth and expansion.

20
00:01:05,331 --> 00:01:08,414
At some point, when the business starts 
taking off and making money,

21
00:01:08,414 --> 00:01:11,888
then usually the entrepreneurs 
are looking to grow the business.

22
00:01:11,888 --> 00:01:15,156
So they would be looking for--

23
00:01:15,703 --> 00:01:17,830
a lot of people call growth financing

24
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,635
and then eventually they are

25
00:01:21,165 --> 00:01:22,587
past the break-even point,

26
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:26,181
and they are growing more rapidly,
and they make seek to expand.

27
00:01:26,181 --> 00:01:29,105
So some people call that 
the expansion financing stage.

28
00:01:29,105 --> 00:01:32,275
Again, a lot of people use
the terms interchangeably,

29
00:01:32,275 --> 00:01:36,647
but after the company's already got 
something in the market.

30
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:37,951
They're already making money,

31
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:42,394
that's when you start looking
for your growth and expansion financing.

32
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:46,823
Alright, so here's our list of investors 
that we've seen many times at this point,

33
00:01:46,823 --> 00:01:49,171
and as you recall from the last segment,

34
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,068
we were really focusing 
on the early stages of investors,

35
00:01:52,068 --> 00:01:54,921
so the first half of this list here.

36
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:56,994
What we're going to do today 
is talk a little bit

37
00:01:56,994 --> 00:01:59,324
about some of the later stages,

38
00:01:59,324 --> 00:02:02,989
the type of people who come 
in at the later stage.

39
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:07,361
So we mentioned before 
that the individual angel was often

40
00:02:07,361 --> 00:02:10,083
associated with seed financing
and start up financing.

41
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:14,262
And angel groups can too,
but just to draw a little distinction

42
00:02:14,262 --> 00:02:16,680
between the individual angel
and angel group:

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,700
some of the angel groups will often 
come in later in the process.

44
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,688
So we're going to include them 
in today's groups.

45
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:26,723
If we just look here, we're going to talk
mainly about this group of people.

46
00:02:27,628 --> 00:02:30,160
Angel groups, family offices,

47
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,055
venture capital, and strategic partners

48
00:02:33,055 --> 00:02:36,196
or strategic investors or corporate 
venture capital investors.

49
00:02:36,196 --> 00:02:38,183
So those are all the same.

50
00:02:38,183 --> 00:02:41,498
So we showed this graphic 
last time and time before

51
00:02:41,498 --> 00:02:44,523
and just to give a rough idea

52
00:02:44,523 --> 00:02:48,571
of the kinds of amounts
that you might expect--

53
00:02:48,571 --> 00:02:53,182
and again it should be calibrated 
to your own country's per capita GDP.

54
00:02:53,182 --> 00:02:57,804
So these are sort of industrialized 
country amounts.

55
00:02:57,804 --> 00:03:01,009
$100,000 dollars or francs

56
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:04,481
which is roughly two times GDP per capita.

57
00:03:04,481 --> 00:03:07,657
So we're going to start 
from that piece of it.

58
00:03:07,657 --> 00:03:09,829
So we're going to basically focus

59
00:03:09,829 --> 00:03:14,680
on this part of the spectrum now.

60
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,699
So that's where we get 
into the angel groups, family offices,

61
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:20,196
venture capital, and strategic partners.

62
00:03:20,196 --> 00:03:22,774
So again, just to talk about how 
to analyze your options.

63
00:03:22,774 --> 00:03:24,856
This is exactly what we talked 
about last time

64
00:03:24,856 --> 00:03:28,939
and we're going to apply 
the same criteria that we did last time

65
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:33,663
for the seed and the start up financing 
to the growth and expansion financing.

66
00:03:35,247 --> 00:03:37,963
We're going to look 
at the financial criteria.

67
00:03:37,963 --> 00:03:39,754
How much money can you raise?

68
00:03:39,754 --> 00:03:41,523
How quickly can you raise it?

69
00:03:41,523 --> 00:03:43,576
What's the time horizon of the investor?

70
00:03:43,576 --> 00:03:45,725
What other costs are involved?

71
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:49,484
We're going to look 
at management criteria.

72
00:03:49,484 --> 00:03:52,049
Can they give you support 
in the funding process?

73
00:03:52,049 --> 00:03:54,345
Can they give you support 
in running your business?

74
00:03:54,345 --> 00:03:56,908
Or can they add some other kind of value,

75
00:03:56,908 --> 00:03:59,775
such as a reputational value, 
credibility, etc.?

76
00:03:59,775 --> 00:04:01,792
And then finally, we're going to look

77
00:04:01,792 --> 00:04:05,334
at the independence that you gain
or that you maintain

78
00:04:05,334 --> 00:04:07,942
depending on which investor invests,

79
00:04:07,942 --> 00:04:11,822
and we're going to look at the degree 
of separation between the source,

80
00:04:11,822 --> 00:04:14,165
between the investor and your team.

81
00:04:14,165 --> 00:04:15,265
In this particular case,

82
00:04:15,265 --> 00:04:17,224
there's not going to be
a lot of variance there

83
00:04:17,224 --> 00:04:18,749
because most of these investors

84
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:21,314
are going to be very distinct
from your team,

85
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:23,769
as opposed to your friends,
and family, etc.

86
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:26,536
But still, leave it on the list 
as something to think about

87
00:04:26,536 --> 00:04:28,723
when you are looking at any investment.

88
00:04:28,723 --> 00:04:31,127
Alright, let's talk about angel groups.

89
00:04:31,127 --> 00:04:36,716
An angel group is 
a group of individual angels

90
00:04:36,716 --> 00:04:42,138
who are wealthy individuals,
mostly former entrepreneurs,

91
00:04:42,138 --> 00:04:45,317
who've already made money
and who want to give back in some way.

92
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:48,400
And they form a group, 
an official organized group,

93
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,612
that meets on a regular basis.

94
00:04:50,612 --> 00:04:54,340
Sometimes once a month, 
or once every couple months

95
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:57,422
to screen ideas from entrepreneurs.

96
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,470
So what you're doing here

97
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:03,194
is you're making a pitch
in front of an angel group.

98
00:05:03,194 --> 00:05:04,473
They might schedule

99
00:05:04,473 --> 00:05:07,583
four to five different entrepreneurs 
to come in and make pitches

100
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,678
and then, at the end of the presentation,

101
00:05:09,678 --> 00:05:11,764
they would have a question 
and answer period,

102
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:13,780
they would have a discussion 
amongst themselves,

103
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,610
and then, they would have 
some kind of vote or tally

104
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:22,040
to see if any of the members of the group
are willing to make an investment

105
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,803
in the entrepreneur's company.

106
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:27,873
And so that would go to the next level, 
you would actually do due diligence

107
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:31,065
and then, they would basically 
make a proposal to sell

108
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:35,790
some of the equity 
of your company to this group.

109
00:05:37,359 --> 00:05:41,986
So the ranges of this is going 
to be typically $250,000 to $1.5 million,

110
00:05:41,986 --> 00:05:44,768
which represents 30 times GDP per capita

111
00:05:44,768 --> 00:05:48,692
with a typical amount 
on the order of $500,000,

112
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:52,612
or say ten times GDP per capita.

113
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,376
The time frame can be relatively quick.

114
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:58,108
A lot of angel groups 
advertise their existence

115
00:05:58,108 --> 00:06:00,415
and have a process for applying.

116
00:06:00,415 --> 00:06:04,538
Although it is recommended that you 
do homework on the group,

117
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:07,384
find out what their specialities are, 
find out what they like

118
00:06:07,384 --> 00:06:10,564
before just sending out applications 
to every single angel group.

119
00:06:10,564 --> 00:06:12,814
It could be done in a month or two.

120
00:06:12,814 --> 00:06:18,120
The time horizon of these angel groups 
is often relatively patient.

121
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:20,424
It's on the order of five to ten years.

122
00:06:21,584 --> 00:06:23,724
Sometimes, they would like to get it out

123
00:06:23,724 --> 00:06:28,186
in a subsequent round 
or before a real exit event.

124
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:30,896
But in many cases, that's not possible, 
and they realize that.

125
00:06:30,896 --> 00:06:35,478
Many times they are willing 
to wait a little bit longer,

126
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:39,524
and they do tend to come in earlier 
in the growth financing

127
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:42,773
or the late start up financing phase.

128
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:47,240
Let's talk about the advantages of having 
an angel group as your investor.

129
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:52,434
One of the biggest advantages 
is that you can get input or advice

130
00:06:52,434 --> 00:06:54,686
from some of these angels.

131
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:57,902
You're going to have a broad talent base.

132
00:06:57,902 --> 00:07:00,701
So you're going to have 
a large number of people.

133
00:07:00,701 --> 00:07:04,937
You get exposure and some of them 
are probably going to be experts

134
00:07:04,937 --> 00:07:09,946
in the same sector in which you are 
already operating or proposing to operate.

135
00:07:09,946 --> 00:07:13,658
So these people are going to be 
very, very good people

136
00:07:13,658 --> 00:07:16,115
for advice on running your company.

137
00:07:16,115 --> 00:07:21,049
Beyond that, for the exposure, 
imagine how long it would take

138
00:07:21,049 --> 00:07:27,240
if you had to hit up, solicit, 
one angel investor at a time.

139
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,638
It would take months.

140
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:30,792
Whereas you might be able 
to walk into a room

141
00:07:30,792 --> 00:07:34,291
of 10 to 50 angels all at once;

142
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:39,039
and some of them might be 
interested in your idea.

143
00:07:40,249 --> 00:07:43,570
And then, in addition to all these, 
once you get the investment

144
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,298
this can also be considered 
a positive signal for your reputation.

145
00:07:47,298 --> 00:07:49,450
So it does have reputational benefits.

146
00:07:49,450 --> 00:07:51,152
It gives you some credibility to say,

147
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:53,748
"I've received an investment
from an angel group,"

148
00:07:53,748 --> 00:07:58,495
which tend to be more well known
than any individual angel.

149
00:07:59,929 --> 00:08:03,020
Disadvantages: of course, here you are

150
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,331
--just like when we talked about
in the last segment--

151
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:09,134
you are going to give up a little bit 
of control of your company.

152
00:08:12,267 --> 00:08:15,574
And you're going to have to give up 
sort of the decision rights

153
00:08:15,574 --> 00:08:19,055
depending on your negotiation 
with the group.

154
00:08:19,055 --> 00:08:22,897
They'll be probably one lead investor, 
one lead angel investor,

155
00:08:22,897 --> 00:08:25,070
and that person will be 
the primary point of contact

156
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:28,758
but you are going to have to deal
with several people

157
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,426
and the second disadvantage

158
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,339
is they may or may not all agree
with each other all the time.

159
00:08:33,339 --> 00:08:36,044
Of course at the beginning 
they're going to be very enthusiastic,

160
00:08:36,044 --> 00:08:38,160
that's why they chose 
to invest in your company

161
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:41,396
but over time, they may not always
agree with each other

162
00:08:41,396 --> 00:08:44,925
and since they're independent individuals

163
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:48,304
you're going to have to negotiate 
with multiple people at the same time

164
00:08:48,304 --> 00:08:51,361
for the direction of your company, 
management decisions, etc.

165
00:08:51,617 --> 00:08:55,564
A family office is an investor

166
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,824
that invests the fortune 
of a single family.

167
00:09:01,248 --> 00:09:03,885
And so they're usually looking

168
00:09:03,885 --> 00:09:09,510
for a portfolio investment 
to diversify their own financial risk.

169
00:09:09,947 --> 00:09:14,890
In many cases, the family office
would not be interested

170
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:17,682
in talking to an individual entrepreneur.

171
00:09:17,682 --> 00:09:20,732
They may be more likely to be 
a partner in a venture capital fund.

172
00:09:20,732 --> 00:09:22,395
We'll talk about that in a minute.

173
00:09:22,395 --> 00:09:26,121
But occasionally, family offices

174
00:09:26,121 --> 00:09:28,460
do make investments 
in individual businesses,

175
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:30,779
and it's becoming more common lately.

176
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:34,928
So this would be, again, you're going 
to sell a share of your company

177
00:09:34,928 --> 00:09:39,611
to a private investor 
who represents a family fortune

178
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:41,596
and this is going to be 
an equity based investment.

179
00:09:41,596 --> 00:09:43,882
So they're going to take 
a share of your company.

180
00:09:44,807 --> 00:09:48,476
The amount range is relatively high.

181
00:09:48,476 --> 00:09:52,246
That's because these investors 
don't want to deal

182
00:09:52,246 --> 00:09:55,967
with a bunch of small investments,

183
00:09:55,967 --> 00:09:59,262
lots of companies, 
lots of stakeholders, etc.

184
00:09:59,262 --> 00:10:02,084
So in general, these are going 
to be on the higher side,

185
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:04,739
probably a more 
capital intensive business.

186
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:09,175
$5 million, which is 
a 100 times GDP per capita

187
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:12,538
I would say would be 
on the low end of that range,

188
00:10:12,538 --> 00:10:14,753
and it can go up from there.

189
00:10:16,213 --> 00:10:19,238
Hard to say what the typical 
investment is here, really.

190
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:23,091
Because these are not public events.

191
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:28,034
Most people don't talk about them.
They're relatively private transactions.

192
00:10:28,034 --> 00:10:32,449
So they are on the higher end 
of the scale here.

193
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,977
Usually, it might take one to three months

194
00:10:35,977 --> 00:10:40,696
to find and negotiate a deal 
with a family office.

195
00:10:41,889 --> 00:10:45,112
The time horizon, on the other hand, 
could be quite patient

196
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:48,395
on the five to ten year frame.

197
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:52,630
So the advantages here are, of course, 
they are larger amounts of money,

198
00:10:53,354 --> 00:10:56,276
which is really nice especially 
if you have some major capital needs

199
00:10:56,276 --> 00:10:58,435
for your growth or expansion phase.

200
00:10:58,435 --> 00:11:01,544
So what are the advantages of 
receiving investment from a family office?

201
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:06,492
The first big one is: these are 
relatively large amounts of money.

202
00:11:06,492 --> 00:11:10,625
If you have a large capital need,

203
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:14,921
you need to buy equipment 
or make an investment in a plant,

204
00:11:14,921 --> 00:11:17,249
or maybe you just have 
a big marketing campaign

205
00:11:17,249 --> 00:11:18,961
which requires a lot of capital

206
00:11:18,961 --> 00:11:23,371
then you can raise larger amounts
of money from them.

207
00:11:23,371 --> 00:11:26,836
They probably are more patient then other

208
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:30,346
late stage investors, 
such as venture capitalists.

209
00:11:31,711 --> 00:11:35,279
The disadvantages though
is very difficult to gain entry

210
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:38,236
to find the family office business

211
00:11:38,236 --> 00:11:42,440
and to talk to somebody, 
to actually pitch to them.

212
00:11:42,853 --> 00:11:45,953
I think it's actually a very tricky thing.

213
00:11:45,953 --> 00:11:48,253
You have to work through 
a network; usually.

214
00:11:48,253 --> 00:11:51,751
They almost always work 
on professional referrals.

215
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:55,191
So it's tricky
to get into a family office.

216
00:11:56,691 --> 00:12:02,283
That's why ordinarily, we don't much 
consider it to be a very credible source,

217
00:12:02,283 --> 00:12:03,668
but on the other hand,

218
00:12:03,668 --> 00:12:06,830
if you happen to run into one
or get access to one,

219
00:12:06,830 --> 00:12:10,413
then you get all the advantages 
we've just discussed.

220
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:13,094
You're going to relinquish 
some control of your business.

221
00:12:13,094 --> 00:12:15,043
These are going to be equity investors,

222
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:18,693
so they are going to have a say
in your management decisions.

223
00:12:18,693 --> 00:12:20,137
On the other hand,

224
00:12:20,137 --> 00:12:24,067
they're probably not going to give you 
any kind of advice or input

225
00:12:25,497 --> 00:12:29,334
but rather be on the more passive side

226
00:12:29,334 --> 00:12:33,294
of the investing advice spectrum.

227
00:12:34,116 --> 00:12:35,820
Alright let's talk about venture capital.

228
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:38,902
Venture capital lumes large

229
00:12:38,902 --> 00:12:41,061
in the minds of most entrepreneurs,

230
00:12:41,061 --> 00:12:43,564
even though most entrepreneurs 
don't get it

231
00:12:43,564 --> 00:12:45,419
or don't even need it in most cases.

232
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:49,793
However, it's so talked about 
that I figured it would be good for us

233
00:12:49,793 --> 00:12:53,068
to get the basics 
of how venture capitalists works

234
00:12:53,068 --> 00:12:57,307
and what are some of the plus 
and minuses of it for this segment here.

235
00:12:57,307 --> 00:13:00,457
The idea behind venture capital 
is you are going to sell

236
00:13:00,457 --> 00:13:04,763
a share of your company
to a professional growth investor.

237
00:13:04,763 --> 00:13:07,833
These are going to be equity 
in based investments

238
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:12,481
and so you are in fact going to relinquish

239
00:13:12,481 --> 00:13:15,177
some part of the ownership 
of your company.

240
00:13:15,572 --> 00:13:19,068
And the amounts range on the higher side.

241
00:13:19,068 --> 00:13:22,723
So usually on the order
of two to ten million dollars,

242
00:13:22,723 --> 00:13:25,848
or let's just say 200 times
GDP per capita,

243
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:29,120
and it's hard to say 
what a typical amount is,

244
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,448
but it could be on the relative 
on the lower end of that $2 million area.

245
00:13:35,922 --> 00:13:39,835
These are often staged investments

246
00:13:39,835 --> 00:13:44,812
so that means even if you raise 
two million from the venture capitalist,

247
00:13:44,812 --> 00:13:47,181
they may not give it to you all at once.

248
00:13:47,181 --> 00:13:51,654
In fact, they're almost never going 
to give it to you all at once.

249
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:54,579
They're going to tie it 
to milestones and deadlines.

250
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:56,415
They're going to check up on you,

251
00:13:56,415 --> 00:14:00,000
and they are going to see if you are 
following the plan that you originally had

252
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,437
or if you have some ideas 
for how to modify the plan.

253
00:14:04,697 --> 00:14:06,801
In terms of the time frame here,

254
00:14:06,801 --> 00:14:09,727
usually two to three months.

255
00:14:09,727 --> 00:14:12,746
Could be more, depending on how long 
the negotiation takes,

256
00:14:12,746 --> 00:14:15,402
and how long it takes you to find some.

257
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:18,366
The time horizon here is going 
to be relatively shorter.

258
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:21,769
Usually on the order 
of five to seven years.

259
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:24,480
That's because they are looking to get

260
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:30,422
a return on their investment 
in a relatively short period of time.

261
00:14:30,422 --> 00:14:32,036
We'll talk about that next.

262
00:14:33,132 --> 00:14:34,814
So what are the advantages here?

263
00:14:34,814 --> 00:14:37,881
They're definitely going 
to give you advice or input,

264
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:42,665
and they can help you make decisions 
on managing your business;

265
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,524
and what to do, strategy decisions.

266
00:14:44,524 --> 00:14:46,066
They have a great network.

267
00:14:46,066 --> 00:14:50,648
So they are able to hire people for you 
or find people for you to hire,

268
00:14:50,648 --> 00:14:54,835
bring people in from their other former 
portfolio companies

269
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:58,037
or portfolio companies, 
or other connections that they have.

270
00:14:58,543 --> 00:15:00,537
Generally, have a lot of good connections.

271
00:15:00,537 --> 00:15:05,216
aThe amount of money raised 
is also favorable for companies

272
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:07,626
that really have a capital need.

273
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:08,987
Usually, we say

274
00:15:08,987 --> 00:15:15,231
a venture capital business is
funding really high growth

275
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:19,538
or high expansion phase 
for capital intensive businesses.

276
00:15:19,538 --> 00:15:22,524
It's not for every kind of company.

277
00:15:22,524 --> 00:15:26,545
The disadvantages here
it's the same as the advantage:

278
00:15:26,545 --> 00:15:28,408
they're going to give you 
advice and input.

279
00:15:28,408 --> 00:15:31,809
In this case, you may not like all 
the advice and input that you receive,

280
00:15:31,809 --> 00:15:34,044
but they're going to definitely 
give it to you,

281
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:38,343
and really, really keep track 
of what you're doing.

282
00:15:38,343 --> 00:15:40,481
They're going to follow 
what you're doing carefully.

283
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,108
You're going to relinquish some control,

284
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,453
you're going to give up 
some ownership of the company,

285
00:15:45,453 --> 00:15:47,888
but you're also going to give up 
some decision rights.

286
00:15:47,888 --> 00:15:51,483
They're going to have,
usually, some kind of veto power

287
00:15:51,483 --> 00:15:54,387
over major strategic decisions
that you're making.

288
00:15:54,387 --> 00:15:58,700
So they're going to really, really look
into what you're doing.

289
00:16:00,562 --> 00:16:05,511
Typically, they're never going to sign 
a non-disclosure agreement

290
00:16:05,511 --> 00:16:08,944
or other sorts of things 
for secrecy pursposes

291
00:16:08,944 --> 00:16:10,509
because of legal reasons.

292
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:13,822
So technically, your ideas 
could be diffused.

293
00:16:13,822 --> 00:16:19,405
They could legally talk

294
00:16:19,405 --> 00:16:22,790
to one of their other portfolio companies
or talk to someone else

295
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:25,492
and maybe inspired
by something that you said,

296
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:27,535
give the idea away to someone else.

297
00:16:27,535 --> 00:16:30,429
Although, again, once they've made 
the decision to invest in you,

298
00:16:30,429 --> 00:16:35,037
they want you to grow,
and to do well, and be successful.

299
00:16:37,099 --> 00:16:39,896
They're not just going to try 
and give your ideas away to anybody

300
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:42,006
but your ideas could leak, 
let's put it that way.

301
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:46,830
And as I mentioned earlier,
the investments are going to be staged.

302
00:16:46,831 --> 00:16:48,964
They're not going to give you 
all the money at once,

303
00:16:48,964 --> 00:16:50,956
and they're going to have 
milestone planning

304
00:16:50,956 --> 00:16:53,612
and they're going to give you 
the pieces of the investment,

305
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:57,270
a small piece at a time,
every time you hit a milestone.

306
00:16:57,426 --> 00:16:59,237
Let's talk about how 
venture capital works.

307
00:16:59,237 --> 00:17:02,020
Venture capitalists make investments

308
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,817
for other investors.

309
00:17:05,294 --> 00:17:08,409
They usually raise funds

310
00:17:08,409 --> 00:17:10,843
for a specific fund,

311
00:17:11,141 --> 00:17:13,638
and they go and they talk 
to different people,

312
00:17:13,638 --> 00:17:16,378
pension funds, family offices,

313
00:17:16,378 --> 00:17:18,560
other wealthy investors,

314
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:21,095
and they take the money from them,

315
00:17:21,095 --> 00:17:24,821
and they create 
a small limited partnership

316
00:17:25,591 --> 00:17:29,118
with those funds,
and then they take that money,

317
00:17:29,118 --> 00:17:33,802
and they invest it in start up companies,

318
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,958
in a portfolio of start up companies.

319
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:41,214
Usually, the way the deal works 
with the limited partners

320
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:45,187
is that there is a time horizon

321
00:17:46,447 --> 00:17:49,610
at which the fund must be liquidated

322
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:52,330
and all remaining amounts of money 
in the fund has to be returned

323
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:54,101
to limited partners.

324
00:17:54,101 --> 00:17:57,922
So that's why there's 
some kind of pressure here

325
00:17:57,922 --> 00:18:00,593
to make an exit event happen.

326
00:18:01,284 --> 00:18:03,281
So as we discussed a few segments ago,

327
00:18:03,281 --> 00:18:06,686
the exit event, 
which could be a trade sale,

328
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:11,434
or an initial public offering,
or some other follow-on investment

329
00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:15,188
is a way for the investors

330
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:16,922
to exit the business.

331
00:18:16,922 --> 00:18:19,259
Not necessarily the entrepreneurs.

332
00:18:19,259 --> 00:18:20,884
And so what they're doing

333
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:26,264
is they are making investments 
in a portfolio of companies

334
00:18:26,264 --> 00:18:29,961
with a specific relatively 
short time horizon

335
00:18:29,961 --> 00:18:32,170
on the order of five to ten years,

336
00:18:32,170 --> 00:18:34,402
they don't make
all the investments at once,

337
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:35,668
at the very beginning.

338
00:18:35,668 --> 00:18:36,995
Time goes on;

339
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:40,691
and then they are building
their portfolio,

340
00:18:40,691 --> 00:18:43,311
but they know that within seven years,

341
00:18:43,311 --> 00:18:45,649
finally by the time they make 
all their investments

342
00:18:45,649 --> 00:18:47,698
they're going to need 
to liquidate that fund.

343
00:18:47,698 --> 00:18:51,215
So therefore, they really,really want 
to see an exit event

344
00:18:51,215 --> 00:18:56,262
for some of the portfolio companies 
in their portfolio.

345
00:18:56,262 --> 00:18:59,209
And if a company isn't performing,

346
00:18:59,209 --> 00:19:02,036
it doesn't look as if it's going 
to actually make a good exit event,

347
00:19:02,036 --> 00:19:05,418
they may cut back on the effort 
and attention they want to give to it,

348
00:19:05,418 --> 00:19:08,912
and focus on one that they think
it's a very, very good chance

349
00:19:08,912 --> 00:19:13,077
of recouping their investments 
and all other portfolio companies.

350
00:19:13,077 --> 00:19:16,649
Because an IPO can more than pay--

351
00:19:16,649 --> 00:19:22,431
one IPO can more than pay
for all the investments that they made

352
00:19:22,431 --> 00:19:27,311
and a trade sale would probably 
break even on the investments themselves.

353
00:19:28,091 --> 00:19:31,123
So they go for a couple big hit home runs.

354
00:19:31,123 --> 00:19:33,183
They look for a couple big exit events.

355
00:19:33,183 --> 00:19:34,525
They look for a couple trade sales,

356
00:19:34,525 --> 00:19:37,428
which breaks even on perhaps
that particular investment,

357
00:19:37,428 --> 00:19:40,321
and overall, they have a very nice return

358
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:44,683
which then they give back
to the limited partners in the end.

359
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:49,309
So that's why venture capitalists 
typically are looking for growth,

360
00:19:49,309 --> 00:19:53,612
and they are looking for exit
at a certain point in time

361
00:19:53,612 --> 00:19:55,759
on a finite time horizon.

362
00:19:55,759 --> 00:19:58,653
OK, let's talk about strategic investors.

363
00:19:58,653 --> 00:20:00,769
Some people call them strategic partners

364
00:20:00,769 --> 00:20:05,135
and some people call them 
corporate venture capital investors.

365
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:06,843
And it's basically all the same.

366
00:20:06,843 --> 00:20:11,856
It's when a large company 
makes an investment in a start up.

367
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:15,573
And so therefore you as the entrepreneur

368
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:19,813
are going to sell a share 
of your company to a larger company.

369
00:20:19,813 --> 00:20:22,355
This is also an equity based investment.

370
00:20:22,355 --> 00:20:27,926
Now the amounts are usually relatively 
large for these kinds of transactions.

371
00:20:27,926 --> 00:20:31,326
So let's say $1 million to $25 million.

372
00:20:31,326 --> 00:20:35,440
That's 500 times GDP per capita.

373
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,939
Quite a large amount.

374
00:20:36,939 --> 00:20:41,890
Typically, hard to say 
because it's very very big variance,

375
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:45,486
but let's say on the order of $10 million.

376
00:20:46,664 --> 00:20:49,139
The time frame is a little bit longer.

377
00:20:49,139 --> 00:20:52,645
Let's say two to five months 
because you have to find the investor.

378
00:20:52,645 --> 00:20:56,717
You have to get into the right person 
inside the big company,

379
00:20:56,717 --> 00:20:58,961
and then you have to negotiate the deal.

380
00:20:58,961 --> 00:21:01,033
Some companies set up their own units

381
00:21:01,033 --> 00:21:04,056
for making corporate
venture capital investments.

382
00:21:04,056 --> 00:21:08,780
But other companies don't have 
such a official organized program,

383
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:11,694
they're more ad-hoc in the way 
that they make investments,

384
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:13,873
and those companies take even longer

385
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:16,496
to decide what to do.

386
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:19,411
On the other hand, for a time horizon

387
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,692
depends on the motivation
of the big company.

388
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:24,873
It could be eight to ten years 
relatively patient,

389
00:21:24,873 --> 00:21:27,020
very patient in general.

390
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:29,592
It also depends on what the purpose 
of this investment is

391
00:21:29,592 --> 00:21:31,674
from the company's point of view.

392
00:21:31,674 --> 00:21:35,354
If they're looking for a financial return.

393
00:21:35,354 --> 00:21:37,737
So they really want to see an exit,

394
00:21:37,737 --> 00:21:40,592
they'll have a similar time horizon 
to a venture capitalist.

395
00:21:40,592 --> 00:21:44,122
On the other hand, if they're looking 
for more of a strategic return.

396
00:21:44,122 --> 00:21:48,239
In other words, is your company going 
to stimulate compliments

397
00:21:48,239 --> 00:21:51,479
that are going to stimulate 
demand for their product.

398
00:21:51,479 --> 00:21:53,583
They may be willing to wait a long time

399
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:57,313
before trying to cash 
out of your business.

400
00:21:57,313 --> 00:22:01,677
The time horizon could be a relatively 
long and patient ten year period

401
00:22:01,677 --> 00:22:05,197
before they would even think very much

402
00:22:05,197 --> 00:22:09,053
about trying to exit
the business as an investor.

403
00:22:09,053 --> 00:22:10,622
So what are the advantages here?

404
00:22:10,622 --> 00:22:12,166
There are lots of advantages.

405
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:14,300
They might be your biggest 
customer or supplier.

406
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,628
So if they're your customer,

407
00:22:16,628 --> 00:22:20,222
then they might think 
that if you sell a lot,

408
00:22:20,222 --> 00:22:22,944
then they're going to sell a lot to you.

409
00:22:22,944 --> 00:22:24,362
So that could be a big advantage.

410
00:22:24,362 --> 00:22:26,783
Your incentives are nice and aligned 
in such a situation

411
00:22:26,783 --> 00:22:28,668
or a supplier could be the same.

412
00:22:28,668 --> 00:22:32,642
They usually don't have 
the exit pressure, usually, as I say here

413
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:37,662
unless they're really, really focusing
on financial return to your company

414
00:22:37,662 --> 00:22:42,308
which most research has shown
is not a very good idea

415
00:22:42,308 --> 00:22:46,286
and usually not very successful from 
the big company's point of view either.

416
00:22:46,286 --> 00:22:50,338
You're better off looking 
for a company that's interested in

417
00:22:50,338 --> 00:22:53,992
the strategic investment
as opposed to a financial investment,

418
00:22:53,992 --> 00:22:56,458
and that will also help
on the time horizon side

419
00:22:56,458 --> 00:23:00,677
because there will be less pressure 
to try and get you spruced up to sell.

420
00:23:02,624 --> 00:23:04,325
Disadvantages.

421
00:23:04,325 --> 00:23:06,187
You do need to relinquish some control.

422
00:23:06,187 --> 00:23:09,675
They are going to have some influence 
on your decision making

423
00:23:09,675 --> 00:23:13,724
and compounding their influence

424
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:18,012
on your decision making is 
the speed of their decision making.

425
00:23:18,012 --> 00:23:22,185
Some people are attracted to start ups 
because they want to make quick decisions

426
00:23:22,185 --> 00:23:25,359
and many big companies, 
especially the kinds that can make

427
00:23:25,359 --> 00:23:29,118
these kinds of $10 million investments
in small companies

428
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:33,159
have very slow decision making processes.

429
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:34,839
You have to factor that in

430
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:37,240
because when you want 
to do something very, very quick,

431
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:39,042
they may not be ready for it.

432
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:43,764
It may take them a very long time to build
consensus inside their big company.

433
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:48,714
Final disadvantage here is-- 
I put strategic conflict.

434
00:23:48,714 --> 00:23:49,746
What does that mean?

435
00:23:49,746 --> 00:23:52,913
Basically what that means is 
at the beginning it looks very good.

436
00:23:52,913 --> 00:23:55,876
It looks very complimentary. It's perfect.

437
00:23:55,876 --> 00:24:00,565
But over time, you may find 
that your business interests

438
00:24:00,565 --> 00:24:05,596
and the big company's business interests 
are not exactly aligned perfectly.

439
00:24:05,596 --> 00:24:10,481
In which case, it can create 
a lot of distraction for the entrepreneurs

440
00:24:10,481 --> 00:24:15,314
and it creates a kind of a conflict 
between the two companies.

441
00:24:15,314 --> 00:24:17,256
And since they are part owner,

442
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:20,807
you're going to be involved
with them quite a bit,

443
00:24:20,807 --> 00:24:25,972
and so if the conflict escalates, 
it can be a big distraction.

444
00:24:25,972 --> 00:24:27,640
OK, so here's the last slide.

445
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:33,093
It's the overview of the sources 
of funding and the process.

446
00:24:34,063 --> 00:24:37,916
And basically just summarizes 
everything that we just discussed.

447
00:24:37,916 --> 00:24:40,545
So just to point out a couple things.

448
00:24:40,545 --> 00:24:43,980
On the left here we have 
the various sources.

449
00:24:45,158 --> 00:24:47,424
How much money you would typically raise

450
00:24:48,026 --> 00:24:52,650
and how quickly this would happen.

451
00:24:54,448 --> 00:24:57,465
I could have put this one here in red too

452
00:24:57,465 --> 00:24:59,488
just because it can take a lot longer.

453
00:25:00,222 --> 00:25:03,233
And we could probably 
put this one in green

454
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:11,559
because they're more patient perhaps, 
a strategic investor.

455
00:25:11,559 --> 00:25:14,917
They do take a lot of time.

456
00:25:15,702 --> 00:25:20,231
They may take a lot of time to make 
the initial investment decision,

457
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:25,465
and they may take a lot of time to make 
on-going strategic decisions for you.

458
00:25:25,984 --> 00:25:27,001
They will give you input.

459
00:25:27,001 --> 00:25:31,403
In fact, all of these sources 
are going to give you input

460
00:25:31,403 --> 00:25:33,753
in managing your company.

461
00:25:35,196 --> 00:25:38,311
And as I point out here, that can be good

462
00:25:38,311 --> 00:25:40,793
because you can get good input 
from a venture capital

463
00:25:40,793 --> 00:25:42,863
but on the other hand,

464
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:47,677
you can also get a lot of input, 
maybe too much input,

465
00:25:47,677 --> 00:25:49,245
from a venture capitalist.

466
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:53,731
With a venture capitalist, 
you do relinquish more control,

467
00:25:53,731 --> 00:25:56,393
and they're going to be more involved.

468
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:58,521
On the other hand,

469
00:25:58,521 --> 00:26:03,064
the reputational benefit of receiving 
venture capital is very very good.

470
00:26:03,064 --> 00:26:06,498
When you can claim
that you received venture capital,

471
00:26:07,921 --> 00:26:12,134
it has a lot of other benefits when 
you're dealing with suppliers, customers.

472
00:26:12,134 --> 00:26:14,214
You say, "Oh, I'm a start up company.

473
00:26:14,214 --> 00:26:17,113
Yeah, I don't really have any investors 
I'm doing everything my own."

474
00:26:17,113 --> 00:26:19,931
Versus: "I just got a major investment 
from this company."

475
00:26:21,011 --> 00:26:25,368
That can be quite useful when 
you're talking with potential customers.

476
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:33,913
Just to continue on 
with the venture capitalist here:

477
00:26:33,913 --> 00:26:35,876
support in the funding process.

478
00:26:35,876 --> 00:26:38,083
I put "Be careful!"

479
00:26:39,814 --> 00:26:43,734
What I meant by that is the incentives 
and the venture capitalists,

480
00:26:43,734 --> 00:26:47,172
and the incentives and the entrepreneur 
is not always 100% aligned,

481
00:26:47,172 --> 00:26:49,772
especially when it comes 
to funding the business.

482
00:26:49,772 --> 00:26:52,317
Of course, if the business 
does very well, everyone is happy,

483
00:26:52,317 --> 00:26:54,267
and there's really no problem.

484
00:26:54,267 --> 00:26:58,604
The only problem happens sometimes 
when the business isn't taking off,

485
00:26:58,604 --> 00:27:02,518
and then some of the structures 
that you can get within your term sheet

486
00:27:02,518 --> 00:27:04,599
you really have to look 
those over carefully

487
00:27:04,599 --> 00:27:06,162
to see how it happened.

488
00:27:06,162 --> 00:27:09,082
In case things go well 
and in case things go less well,

489
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:11,994
and they're going to take 
an equity position in your company.

490
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:13,814
They're all going 
to take equity positions.

491
00:27:15,307 --> 00:27:18,071
But they're going to be 
more active investors,

492
00:27:18,071 --> 00:27:19,738
venture capitalists.

493
00:27:23,662 --> 00:27:27,871
The only last couple things that I wanted 
to say here about angel groups.

494
00:27:30,431 --> 00:27:32,387
You can have many investors

495
00:27:35,176 --> 00:27:39,093
and as it's a group, they're not working 
together for the same company.

496
00:27:39,093 --> 00:27:42,839
They are independent people and so you may
have to deal with many investors.

497
00:27:43,444 --> 00:27:45,017
On the other hand,

498
00:27:46,007 --> 00:27:49,547
they can give you advice 
not only on the funding process

499
00:27:49,547 --> 00:27:51,819
but also on management decisions,

500
00:27:51,819 --> 00:27:54,385
and they also give you a good reputation.

501
00:27:54,385 --> 00:27:57,241
If you can say, you've received 
an investment from an angel group.

502
00:27:57,241 --> 00:28:01,543
That could be considered beneficial 
when you negotiate with other partners.

503
00:28:03,112 --> 00:28:05,840
Independence, as I mentioned, 
you're going to relinquish

504
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:06,830
some control no matter what.

505
00:28:06,830 --> 00:28:09,382
You're probably going to relinquish 
more decision making control

506
00:28:09,382 --> 00:28:11,888
if you receive venture capital investment.

507
00:28:11,888 --> 00:28:14,864
And in terms of the separation, 
as I mentioned in the very beginning--

508
00:28:14,864 --> 00:28:16,431
I didn't write anything here

509
00:28:16,431 --> 00:28:19,747
because basically all of these sources

510
00:28:19,747 --> 00:28:25,737
are very, very separated
from your typical team,

511
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,077
your founding team.

512
00:28:27,077 --> 00:28:29,407
You're not related to them.

513
00:28:29,407 --> 00:28:31,929
You're not working with them 
all the time, etc.

514
00:28:31,929 --> 00:28:34,442
So there's a very very clean separation

515
00:28:34,442 --> 00:28:38,116
and they're all going to do 
very, very careful due diligence,

516
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:40,135
which can take some time.

517
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:42,344
They're going to investigate 
your business,

518
00:28:42,344 --> 00:28:44,300
your business model, your business plan.

519
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,910
They're going to decide in a neutral way

520
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:49,623
whether it's worth it for them
to make an investment

521
00:28:49,623 --> 00:28:52,283
because they're looking 
for an eventual exit

522
00:28:52,283 --> 00:28:54,556
or in the case
of a corporate venture capital,

523
00:28:54,556 --> 00:28:58,120
they're looking for some kind 
of strategic bonus for their own business

524
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,805
that will help their own business.

525
00:29:02,036 --> 00:29:05,765
So let's have a look at an interview 
now to talk a little bit about

526
00:29:05,765 --> 00:29:07,954
some of these sources of financing,

527
00:29:08,537 --> 00:29:12,527
and we're going to see you soon
for the next segment.

528
00:29:12,527 --> 00:29:13,602
Thanks a lot.
