00:00:00,227 --> 00:00:01,942
(swooshing sounds)

00:00:01,942 --> 00:00:05,835
♪ (eclectic downtempo music) ♪

3
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:17,283
♪ (music continues) ♪

4
00:00:35,044 --> 00:00:38,363
Welcome to Week 4:
Raising and Managing Money.

5
00:00:38,363 --> 00:00:41,986
And just to recap what we did so far:
we are already in Week 4

6
00:00:41,986 --> 00:00:45,024
and the course has only five weeks
so remember this, we are almost done.

7
00:00:45,024 --> 00:00:49,751
But in Week 2 we did talk about
entrepreneurial opportunities,

8
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:53,094
how you identify multiple opportunities
based on your technology.

9
00:00:53,094 --> 00:00:55,533
Remember that term
<i>technological fungibility</i>

10
00:00:55,533 --> 00:00:59,357
sounds fancy but it actually means
that you can apply your technology

11
00:00:59,357 --> 00:01:02,085
to multiple ends, you know,
multiple customers' ends.

12
00:01:02,085 --> 00:01:04,583
We talked about evaluation
of opportunities and developing

13
00:01:04,583 --> 00:01:08,005
a road map to exploit your multiple
opportunities over time.

14
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:10,977
Right, then in last week, Week 3
we talked a lot

15
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:14,938
about entrepreneurial marketing,
we helped think about developing

16
00:01:14,938 --> 00:01:18,551
a marketing plan, we wanted to know
who your customers are,

17
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:22,460
what your value proposition is,
and we talked about guerrilla marketing.

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,671
Which is actually quite an exciting
form of marketing,

19
00:01:24,671 --> 00:01:26,164
it's more on the operational side.

20
00:01:26,164 --> 00:01:28,131
It should be aligned
with your overall strategy.

21
00:01:28,131 --> 00:01:30,728
But the underlying logic was
that you actually should say,

22
00:01:30,728 --> 00:01:33,678
"OK, I have to be smart because
I do not have so many funds"

23
00:01:33,678 --> 00:01:36,112
"like the larger corporations
to run my marketing campaign."

24
00:01:36,112 --> 00:01:36,950
Perfect.

25
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,009
So let's look and see what we're going
to cover in the next week.

26
00:01:40,009 --> 00:01:43,599
So, as Mark just said, you may be running
a guerrilla marketing campaign

27
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:47,669
and a very lean operation,
but it's still going to cost you

28
00:01:47,669 --> 00:01:49,407
to get your company
off the ground.

29
00:01:49,407 --> 00:01:52,048
So in the first part of this week
we're going to study:

30
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:54,484
How much money do you need?

31
00:01:54,484 --> 00:01:57,124
That's going to involve making
some financial projections

32
00:01:57,124 --> 00:02:00,338
for the next few years
and trying to understand

33
00:02:00,338 --> 00:02:04,918
how much cash you're spending
and how much you're bringing in.

34
00:02:04,918 --> 00:02:08,240
Therefore, what your overall
financing needs are

35
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,530
to get your company launched.

36
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,707
So in addition to doing
the financial projections,

37
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:14,906
you also have to know which type
of financing is available

38
00:02:14,906 --> 00:02:17,872
and from whom you could get
the money that you need.

39
00:02:17,872 --> 00:02:21,566
So in terms of type of financing,
you can think about debt financing,

40
00:02:21,566 --> 00:02:24,979
you might even get gifts,
you might get equity financing,

41
00:02:24,979 --> 00:02:26,866
there might be convertible debt.

42
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:30,402
This might sound technical to some
but we're going to walk you in detail

43
00:02:30,402 --> 00:02:33,253
through each of these types
of financing in segment 4.2.

44
00:02:33,253 --> 00:02:35,314
In addition we look
at the types of investors.

45
00:02:35,314 --> 00:02:38,226
Right, so there'd be a big laundry list
here of investors.

46
00:02:38,675 --> 00:02:42,156
Which is good news because people
who have money and want to invest--

47
00:02:42,156 --> 00:02:44,080
Yes, there are lots of sources for you.

48
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,922
So what we'll do is we'll just walk
through the big picture

49
00:02:47,922 --> 00:02:51,422
on the types of investors
and then we'll break it out by stage

50
00:02:51,422 --> 00:02:52,769
which we'll discuss right now.

51
00:02:52,769 --> 00:02:57,567
So in 4.3, we'll focus on the early stages
of your company,

52
00:02:57,567 --> 00:03:00,912
before you're making any money
and you're really launching your company

53
00:03:00,912 --> 00:03:02,516
and getting it off the ground.

54
00:03:02,516 --> 00:03:06,730
So what kind of investors are going to be
most appropriate for those early stages?

55
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:10,532
It could be your friends and your family
because they believe in you,

56
00:03:10,532 --> 00:03:11,979
they want to support you.

57
00:03:11,979 --> 00:03:16,133
It could also be crowd-funding campaigns
and that's quite an important element

58
00:03:16,133 --> 00:03:17,774
especially in this MOOC today.

59
00:03:18,313 --> 00:03:22,004
It could be also startup competitions,
it could be angel investors

60
00:03:22,004 --> 00:03:24,636
and all these types
of venture capitalists at some points.

61
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:29,252
So in 4.4, we'll focus more
on the later stages of the venture process

62
00:03:29,252 --> 00:03:33,690
when you've already got a product
when maybe you've already got some sales

63
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,099
and you're basically growing the company
and we have the expansion financing

64
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:41,192
and there's a whole new set
of actors that are available

65
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:43,088
to help finance your venture.

66
00:03:43,088 --> 00:03:46,530
So think about family offices,
think about banks, etc.

67
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:51,453
because these are actors that want to see
that you have proof of technology

68
00:03:51,453 --> 00:03:54,492
and the proof of market, that there are
customers out there who are willing

69
00:03:54,492 --> 00:03:58,715
to pay for your products
and that your technology actually works,

70
00:03:58,715 --> 00:04:01,336
it does the things you promise it does.

71
00:04:01,336 --> 00:04:05,646
Because then a lot of risk is taken
off the table for these types of investors

72
00:04:05,646 --> 00:04:09,048
and that means that these investors
would be looking at companies

73
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,184
that have different risk profiles
and the investors that we just discussed

74
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:14,570
on the previous slide which would be
more of the investors

75
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:19,991
that look at early stage companies
and are ready and available

76
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:24,722
to actually invest in companies
that are less mature and have more risk.

77
00:04:24,722 --> 00:04:29,935
So what we'll do is for all of these
we'll walk through how much money

78
00:04:29,935 --> 00:04:32,936
you'd expect to raise,
what the time horizon is,

79
00:04:32,936 --> 00:04:36,029
and lots of different
psychological aspects

80
00:04:36,029 --> 00:04:38,202
of working with different
types of investors.

81
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:41,255
And the bottom line is that we want
to give you a very good understanding

82
00:04:41,255 --> 00:04:45,222
of the funding universe that is out there
because without the funds of other people

83
00:04:45,222 --> 00:04:48,075
you probably will not get far
with your technology venture.

84
00:04:48,075 --> 00:04:52,283
So one important way of getting funding
nowadays is <i>crowdfunding</i>.

85
00:04:52,283 --> 00:04:56,127
You remember that from the marketing
module; we introduced you to this concept

86
00:04:56,127 --> 00:04:59,104
because it has important
marketing elements to it.

87
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:01,014
It helps you in launching your product,

88
00:05:01,014 --> 00:05:03,175
it helps you in getting visibility
with your company,

89
00:05:03,175 --> 00:05:04,652
but that's one aspect.

90
00:05:04,652 --> 00:05:06,887
It has also a very important
financial aspect to it.

91
00:05:06,887 --> 00:05:11,859
That's right, I mean entrepreneurs now
can, via internet platforms,

92
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:15,974
reach out to investors who happen to be
all over the whole world.

93
00:05:16,437 --> 00:05:19,055
What we'll do in this particular segment

94
00:05:19,055 --> 00:05:22,944
is we'll walk through how that works,
we'll talk a little bit

95
00:05:22,944 --> 00:05:26,490
about some of the legal/financial
implications of having lots of investors

96
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,536
all over the world and how you can
expect to raise money from them,

97
00:05:30,536 --> 00:05:33,966
going into details about how
some of the crowd-funding platforms work.

98
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,106
Exactly.

99
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:38,129
And that, it think, is a wonderful
opportunity for each and every one of you

100
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,617
to get your venture off the ground

101
00:05:39,617 --> 00:05:42,057
and to make your first steps
as an entrepreneur.

102
00:05:42,609 --> 00:05:46,344
So these crowd funding campaigns
give you access to potential investors

103
00:05:46,344 --> 00:05:49,337
across the globe but never forget
that you actually need

104
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:53,180
to manage your cash because this is more
like an operational issue

105
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,475
but it's highly important.

106
00:05:54,475 --> 00:05:57,856
It's like the air that you breathe;
the cash is the air that you breathe.

107
00:05:57,856 --> 00:06:01,722
Because if you run out of cash, it's like
running out of air that you breathe.

108
00:06:01,722 --> 00:06:04,157
And what happens if you run out
of air that you breathe?

109
00:06:04,157 --> 00:06:05,904
You fall over and you die.

110
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:09,081
And if this were to happen to your company
it would just go bankrupt, you know,

111
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:13,256
so managing your cash is
our focus in module 4.6.

112
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:16,019
And this has a couple of other issues
that are related to it.

113
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:18,208
We'll talk a little bit
about the <i>burn rate,</i>

114
00:06:18,208 --> 00:06:22,235
so how much you're spending
relative to how much you have.

115
00:06:22,235 --> 00:06:25,582
We'll talk about having bank accounts,
how to look for a bank,

116
00:06:25,582 --> 00:06:27,356
keeping your accounts separate.

117
00:06:27,356 --> 00:06:31,454
We'll talk a little bit about shrinkage,
or your employees stealing from you

118
00:06:31,454 --> 00:06:34,115
or you stealing from yourself
by mixing your funds,

119
00:06:34,115 --> 00:06:38,404
and we'll go through a lot of details
on how to manage your cash.

120
00:06:38,404 --> 00:06:40,719
And conserve your air in that way.

121
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:43,167
- Conserving your air.
- Conserving your air.

122
00:06:43,167 --> 00:06:47,292
So that's what's in your future
for Week 4 in Raising and Managing Money.

123
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:49,859
- Don't go away.
- Stay tuned.
