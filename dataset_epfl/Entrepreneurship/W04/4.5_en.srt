1
00:00:08,767 --> 00:00:09,881
Welcome back!

2
00:00:09,881 --> 00:00:12,547
This is about Crowdfunding, Part II.

3
00:00:12,547 --> 00:00:16,374
As you know, we already talked about
the marketing aspects of crowdfunding

4
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:20,594
a week or two ago,
and now we're going to talk

5
00:00:20,594 --> 00:00:23,340
about the financial aspects
of crowdfunding.

6
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,123
Exactly, and like any good movie,
it has a sequel,

7
00:00:26,123 --> 00:00:27,857
so this is Crowdfunding part II.

8
00:00:27,857 --> 00:00:30,310
- Son of... Crowdfunding!
- Exactly!

9
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:31,749
(laughter)

10
00:00:31,749 --> 00:00:34,880
Okay, as you recall
from our discussion of marketing,

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:38,482
crowdfunding is when candidates 
or entrepreneurs

12
00:00:38,482 --> 00:00:42,202
are exposed via internet platforms

13
00:00:42,202 --> 00:00:45,547
to a wide variety of backers

14
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:51,234
that may help them financially
and otherwise in their campaigns.

15
00:00:51,554 --> 00:00:53,726
Exactly, so when you think
about crowdfunding,

16
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:57,277
you can think about that in a more
systematic way in the following sense:

17
00:00:57,756 --> 00:01:00,721
you have, on the one hand,
the entrepreneur,

18
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:05,024
on the other hand, the crowd,
and you can transmit project information,

19
00:01:05,024 --> 00:01:07,411
potential rewards towards the crowd.

20
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:10,075
The crowd could provide you
with seed funding

21
00:01:10,075 --> 00:01:12,438
and other non-financial resources
like reputation, etcetera.

22
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:14,790
We talked about that
in the marketing part,

23
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:17,199
but essentially it's enabled by the web

24
00:01:17,199 --> 00:01:19,776
and that's why we see it
as a fairly new phenomenon,

25
00:01:19,776 --> 00:01:22,762
but a phenomenon that has taken off
quite dramatically

26
00:01:22,762 --> 00:01:27,642
in the past few years, and therefore
it's very important to entrepreneurs

27
00:01:27,642 --> 00:01:32,262
in all kinds of directions
and regions on Earth.

28
00:01:32,496 --> 00:01:35,367
(Chris) So, it's no surprise 
that crowdfunding

29
00:01:35,367 --> 00:01:39,851
has raised a lot of money
over the last five years or so.

30
00:01:40,641 --> 00:01:45,427
In 2012 it was 2.7 billion,
in 2013 5.1 billion.

31
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:48,305
People projected-- they haven't
quite calculated for 2014 yet,

32
00:01:48,305 --> 00:01:50,408
but almost double that again.

33
00:01:50,408 --> 00:01:54,498
So it's a really, really important
phenomenon right now--

34
00:01:54,498 --> 00:01:56,263
- Worldwide.
- Worldwide.

35
00:01:56,263 --> 00:02:00,280
(Chris) Now, these players, of course,
they have their roles

36
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,835
as we discussed a little bit
in the marketing segment,

37
00:02:03,955 --> 00:02:06,666
their different roles switch around.

38
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:09,446
Sometimes the entrepreneur
becomes a backer,

39
00:02:09,446 --> 00:02:12,034
but in general, they're the entrepreneurs.

40
00:02:12,034 --> 00:02:13,982
They're people who like to make things.

41
00:02:13,982 --> 00:02:16,539
There are artists, there are fans,
and there are many other roles

42
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:20,654
people can back one
and receive money from another

43
00:02:20,654 --> 00:02:26,758
and generally speaking, take part
in this crowdfunding ecosystem.

44
00:02:26,838 --> 00:02:29,884
(Marc) Some people even just want
to spend time on a crowdfunding platform

45
00:02:29,884 --> 00:02:32,728
because it's also fun to watch,
and then they become backers.

46
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:36,108
Just because it's fun to back others
with exciting plans.

47
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:38,531
(Chris) So we think about 
the different ways

48
00:02:38,531 --> 00:02:41,888
that you can raise money
through crowdfunding

49
00:02:41,888 --> 00:02:45,689
and we've identified
at least five or six here

50
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,362
that use different mechanisms,

51
00:02:48,362 --> 00:02:50,095
and on the left side of these slides,

52
00:02:50,095 --> 00:02:55,800
what we've done is shown you examples
of different crowdfunding sites

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,161
that are actually out there right now
that use these different methods.

54
00:02:59,161 --> 00:03:03,254
So the first one might be equity funding.

55
00:03:03,254 --> 00:03:06,461
And by equity funding, what that means 
is that you're really giving up

56
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:07,711
a piece of your company,

57
00:03:07,711 --> 00:03:10,084
just as we discussed 
already this past week.

58
00:03:11,004 --> 00:03:14,555
It's not quite set up in most countries
in the world right now.

59
00:03:14,843 --> 00:03:18,316
I think the UK and Australia and Italy

60
00:03:18,316 --> 00:03:22,180
are examples of places
where it's already legal

61
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:25,284
and the US is moving
down that road right now.

62
00:03:25,824 --> 00:03:30,514
The issue being that when you have
lots of equity backers,

63
00:03:30,514 --> 00:03:34,943
that you might be thought to have
a publicly traded company.

64
00:03:34,943 --> 00:03:36,885
So you have to have
special rules in place to say,

65
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:40,401
"Well, if it's a small amount of money..."
(chuckles) etcetera,

66
00:03:40,401 --> 00:03:43,201
- Then you may not be considered--
- It's a complicated problem.

67
00:03:43,201 --> 00:03:48,268
(Chris) It's a complicated problem.
So equity funding is one way of doing it.

68
00:03:48,268 --> 00:03:50,393
Generally speaking,
it's not the most common way

69
00:03:50,393 --> 00:03:52,797
- But it is something that you see--
- It's up and coming.

70
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:55,935
(Chris) It's up and coming, for sure
and more countries are doing it now.

71
00:03:56,296 --> 00:03:59,050
Another kind is for debt financing,

72
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:06,209
and here your crowdfunding
is going to be soliciting loans for you

73
00:04:06,209 --> 00:04:08,085
and you're supposed to pay them back.

74
00:04:08,085 --> 00:04:10,378
(Marc) So it's an interest payment,
which could be much higher

75
00:04:10,378 --> 00:04:12,622
than the current interest rates
you get in bank accounts.

76
00:04:12,622 --> 00:04:16,952
(Chris) Yeah, usually it's 
a lower interest or no interest loan

77
00:04:16,952 --> 00:04:20,131
depending on the site,
but each one is different,

78
00:04:20,131 --> 00:04:21,595
and it is one of the options.

79
00:04:21,595 --> 00:04:25,295
Again, it's not one of the most common
types of crowdfunding schemes

80
00:04:25,295 --> 00:04:27,316
but it is something to be aware of

81
00:04:27,316 --> 00:04:31,338
in case you are able
to get that kind of financing.

82
00:04:31,338 --> 00:04:35,596
The third type is called
<i>reward-based</i> crowdfunding

83
00:04:35,596 --> 00:04:42,290
and that's where you make a donation
and you get some kind of reward back

84
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,169
for having made the donation.

85
00:04:44,169 --> 00:04:45,679
(Marc) We brought some examples with us.

86
00:04:45,679 --> 00:04:48,631
Yeah, this is actually something
that our assistant, Netra, did.

87
00:04:48,631 --> 00:04:50,535
She actually went
onto this crowdfunding site

88
00:04:50,535 --> 00:04:52,322
as you can see on the slide,

89
00:04:52,322 --> 00:04:56,653
and in recognition
of having donated some money,

90
00:04:56,653 --> 00:05:00,296
what she was able to do
is she got a photo of the artist

91
00:05:00,296 --> 00:05:03,769
and she got a sample
of the textile that would be used

92
00:05:03,769 --> 00:05:08,024
and then, eventually, she made
a donation and she received

93
00:05:08,024 --> 00:05:15,100
this handsome mini purse as the reward
for having made that donation.

94
00:05:16,674 --> 00:05:21,432
The next kind of schema is the pre-sales,

95
00:05:21,432 --> 00:05:23,389
and we talked a little bit
about this in marketing.

96
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:29,434
This is where you have a prototype
or you are not quite ready for production,

97
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:33,099
but you are actually
selling your inventory in advance.

98
00:05:33,099 --> 00:05:39,431
It's a great way of reaching your market
and of getting money to help finance

99
00:05:39,431 --> 00:05:43,570
the manufacturing
or the growth of your business.

100
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:45,422
That was pre-sales.

101
00:05:45,422 --> 00:05:50,564
Now, for sales, some sites like 
Tilt here are setting it up

102
00:05:50,564 --> 00:05:52,779
so that if you reach your goal,

103
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:56,892
you could actually continue to sell
as an additional sales channel,

104
00:05:56,892 --> 00:06:00,994
like an e-commerce site selling
your products or services on their site

105
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:02,658
after you've reached your goal.

106
00:06:02,658 --> 00:06:05,456
So then you've got your post--
you've got your pre-sales,

107
00:06:05,456 --> 00:06:10,794
and then once you make your goal,
you keep selling through that channel.

108
00:06:10,794 --> 00:06:13,194
(Marc) Which actually is
kind of a nice solution here,

109
00:06:13,194 --> 00:06:15,300
because you can stay
on the same platform,

110
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,702
people know that you're on the platform,

111
00:06:16,702 --> 00:06:19,850
so you can move from pre-sales
to sales very efficiently

112
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:21,627
and it's also kind of nice
for this platform

113
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:25,066
because they keep the companies
while they're operational.

114
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:27,814
So it's I think, a win-win strategy
by both sides.

115
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:32,851
The last scheme for crowdfunding is
what we're calling In-kind contribution.

116
00:06:32,851 --> 00:06:35,693
That's where someone may say,

117
00:06:35,693 --> 00:06:38,493
"Hey, I will do your 
marketing plan for you."

118
00:06:38,493 --> 00:06:41,466
or "I will help you advertise."

119
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:43,776
Basically, people donating their time,

120
00:06:43,776 --> 00:06:46,161
and this is where
it's kind of this funny fine line

121
00:06:46,161 --> 00:06:48,835
between crowdfunding and crowdsourcing,

122
00:06:48,835 --> 00:06:53,166
because crowdsourcing is actually
trying to solicit services

123
00:06:53,166 --> 00:06:57,342
or knowledge from people
across the internet, across the world,

124
00:06:57,342 --> 00:06:59,600
and this is also saving you money,

125
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,027
because now you don't have to pay someone
to develop a marketing plan for you.

126
00:07:03,027 --> 00:07:07,399
(Marc) Exactly, and it can help you 
to figure out also for what other things

127
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:09,870
you might have to raise money,
because there's no one out there

128
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:12,893
who can help and support you
with your activities

129
00:07:12,893 --> 00:07:15,322
or with the type of resources
you're looking for.

130
00:07:15,322 --> 00:07:18,333
So you've seen all these examples
but you might still ask yourself,

131
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,895
"Why do I need crowdfunding?
Why should I do it?"

132
00:07:20,895 --> 00:07:22,910
The marketing aspects are one thing,

133
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:25,021
but the financial aspects
are another thing.

134
00:07:25,021 --> 00:07:28,967
Right, so I think that it's
a great source for seed financing

135
00:07:29,347 --> 00:07:33,221
across a very wide range of dollar amounts

136
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:37,600
and except for the one case
that we discussed already,

137
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,455
where you have equity crowdfunding,

138
00:07:40,455 --> 00:07:43,901
in most cases the backers
do not take equity in your venture.

139
00:07:43,901 --> 00:07:47,293
Exactly, and you should remember
also that you are obliged

140
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:51,049
to actually use the proceeds
that you get from a crowdfunding campaign

141
00:07:52,029 --> 00:07:54,013
according to the purpose you proclaimed.

142
00:07:54,013 --> 00:07:57,434
So it's keeping your promise
to do these things

143
00:07:57,434 --> 00:08:00,053
that you actually execute it
and promise to execute.

144
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:01,314
And if you don't do it, then, of course,

145
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:05,352
it can have really bad
reputational effects for you too.

146
00:08:05,352 --> 00:08:08,172
So it's really important--
sometimes it's obligated,

147
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:10,738
and in most cases,
you want to do it anyways.

148
00:08:11,068 --> 00:08:13,335
Now let's talk about
the funding options here.

149
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:16,962
We want to draw a distinction
between two types of funding options,

150
00:08:16,962 --> 00:08:20,698
and it may influence how you set up
your crowdfunding campaign too.

151
00:08:20,698 --> 00:08:23,927
The first one is called <i>fixed</i>,
which is all or nothing.

152
00:08:23,927 --> 00:08:25,992
Basically, if you don't
reach your threshold,

153
00:08:25,992 --> 00:08:28,594
you don't get any funding,
and the other is called <i>flexible</i>

154
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:30,696
which is where you get
to keep whatever you raise

155
00:08:30,696 --> 00:08:32,571
regardless of what your goal is.

156
00:08:32,571 --> 00:08:35,538
We'll talk about the pluses
and minuses of each of those next.

157
00:08:35,942 --> 00:08:38,393
(Marc) For the fixed funding schemes,
the all or nothing,

158
00:08:38,393 --> 00:08:40,487
the pros are fairly evident.

159
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,509
You have a solid dollar amount goal.

160
00:08:42,509 --> 00:08:45,623
That's transparent for everyone,
for you and for others.

161
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:49,764
It creates some sense of urgency
and it could be a quick motivation,

162
00:08:49,764 --> 00:08:52,048
especially if you're getting
close to that amount,

163
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:53,648
people might say,
"I'll help this guy,

164
00:08:53,648 --> 00:08:56,168
I feel sorry for him
but he cannot reach it,

165
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:59,464
so I feel motivated now
to actually support him."

166
00:08:59,464 --> 00:09:00,898
(Chris) You call all your friends 
and you say,

167
00:09:00,898 --> 00:09:02,898
(Marc) I just need--
(laughing)

168
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:05,785
It's straightforward for the backers
and it builds trust,

169
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:09,150
because you say "I only do it
if I reach that amount."

170
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,238
It's in a way communicating to others
that "If I don't reach that amount,

171
00:09:14,238 --> 00:09:16,366
it's useless to start the project, even."

172
00:09:16,366 --> 00:09:19,290
So it signals also that it's
very well thought through.

173
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:23,498
This option is offered on almost every
type of crowdfunding platform out there.

174
00:09:23,828 --> 00:09:26,048
(Chris) In terms of the negatives here,

175
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:29,370
if you don't reach your goal,
you get nothing.

176
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,733
In general, there may be some options
in certain sites to make you pay

177
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:36,505
a higher fee and getting what you got
instead of your goal,

178
00:09:36,505 --> 00:09:38,738
but in general, you don't get anything.

179
00:09:38,738 --> 00:09:42,998
So there's definitely some pressure there.

180
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:46,495
There's also pressure
to deliver something creative

181
00:09:46,915 --> 00:09:49,473
because you want to attract the backers

182
00:09:49,473 --> 00:09:51,610
and you need them to give you the money,

183
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,734
or else you won't hit
your threshold target.

184
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:56,914
Lastly, this requires a lot of confidence.

185
00:09:56,914 --> 00:10:00,695
You have to feel like you are really
going to get this amount.

186
00:10:00,695 --> 00:10:03,067
You have to strategically think
about what is your threshold

187
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:07,090
that you're willing to shoot for
so you can get all the amount.

188
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:11,139
Now, usually, if in these situations
you raise more than the amount,

189
00:10:11,969 --> 00:10:14,923
then you get to keep whatever
is above your threshold as well.

190
00:10:14,923 --> 00:10:19,853
Let's talk about a couple of examples
here of some fixed schemes.

191
00:10:21,233 --> 00:10:26,342
This one on the left shows a smart remote
and it looks as if they set

192
00:10:26,342 --> 00:10:30,064
an initial target of $9,000 or something

193
00:10:30,754 --> 00:10:34,563
and they ended up raising $33,000
or something around that,

194
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:38,244
and the second one was this watch

195
00:10:38,824 --> 00:10:43,259
that was set to raise $60,000
or something like that

196
00:10:43,259 --> 00:10:45,837
and ended up raising $372,000

197
00:10:45,837 --> 00:10:49,259
and this became on this Indigogo site

198
00:10:51,009 --> 00:10:53,500
called the <i>in-demand</i> option

199
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,514
which basically, as we mentioned before,

200
00:10:55,514 --> 00:11:00,060
allows you to continue selling
through their channel

201
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:03,560
because you've exceeded
your goal by some vast amount.

202
00:11:04,506 --> 00:11:06,823
(Marc) Let's move to the flexible
funding schemes now

203
00:11:06,823 --> 00:11:09,638
and again there are pros
and cons towards that.

204
00:11:09,638 --> 00:11:12,435
(Marc) I will talk about the pros.
(Chris) And I'm mister negative.

205
00:11:12,435 --> 00:11:14,324
(Marc) You talk about the cons, okay.

206
00:11:14,324 --> 00:11:17,149
The pros are fairly straightforward again.

207
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:21,685
It's because you do not have such a fixed
target that you're trying to fill,

208
00:11:22,725 --> 00:11:25,598
this is not such an important
strategic move, to set that.

209
00:11:25,598 --> 00:11:29,628
You can set one or the other goal,
but it's not important that it is reached.

210
00:11:29,628 --> 00:11:33,341
So it's not as significant
as a strategic move.

211
00:11:33,341 --> 00:11:36,430
You therefore worry less
about reaching your funding goal

212
00:11:36,430 --> 00:11:38,947
and there's less timing pressure
for your campaign.

213
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:40,379
On the other hand there are cons.

214
00:11:40,379 --> 00:11:43,183
(Chris) Yeah, so there's less
of a guarantee for backers.

215
00:11:43,183 --> 00:11:48,193
It's not obvious that this whole thing
will be pulled off, in some sense,

216
00:11:48,193 --> 00:11:51,325
and I think a lot of backers
don't perceive it to be

217
00:11:51,325 --> 00:11:54,706
as serious of an endeavor
as a fixed funding

218
00:11:54,706 --> 00:11:56,839
and there can be potential for higher fees

219
00:11:56,839 --> 00:12:00,949
just because some platforms charge you
more for small amounts of money,

220
00:12:00,949 --> 00:12:04,151
or if you don't make your goal
you may have to pay more, etcetera.

221
00:12:04,151 --> 00:12:07,680
You still get it, but you have to pay
a little bit higher fees for it,

222
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,481
and it's not always offered
on every platform.

223
00:12:11,481 --> 00:12:18,771
Basically, you don't have the opportunity
to always do a flexible funding option.

224
00:12:19,339 --> 00:12:23,208
Here's a great example of a flexible one.

225
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:30,102
This was the "Flow-Hive"
and these guys invented a beehive

226
00:12:30,102 --> 00:12:33,187
that would actually deliver
the honey to you directly

227
00:12:33,187 --> 00:12:35,687
so you don't have to go inside the hive.

228
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:37,506
(Marc) A very secure option.

229
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:42,006
(Chris) Here you see they raised
8.5 plus million dollars,

230
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:43,443
and they're selling these things,

231
00:12:43,443 --> 00:12:45,961
so for $600 you could have your own hive

232
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:48,662
and they're careful to note
that bees are not included.

233
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:49,756
(laughing)

234
00:12:49,756 --> 00:12:52,240
(Marc) But the interesting thing is,
if you look closely,

235
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,900
is they had a $70,000 goal so that
was a big surprise to the upside.

236
00:12:56,900 --> 00:13:02,196
You're asking for $70,000
and then getting $8.558 million.

237
00:13:02,196 --> 00:13:05,448
So that's an amazing multiple there.

238
00:13:05,448 --> 00:13:11,533
Right, so what you want to do is decide
which platform you want to be on,

239
00:13:11,533 --> 00:13:13,611
and there are some big ones out there,

240
00:13:13,611 --> 00:13:16,399
but there are also
a lot of smaller ones as well.

241
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,127
So there are lots of crowdfunding options
awaiting for you.

242
00:13:20,027 --> 00:13:24,464
One key question is, who do you
want to compete with for the money?

243
00:13:24,464 --> 00:13:27,229
Because if there are 5 million
other projects out there,

244
00:13:27,229 --> 00:13:29,056
you're one out of 5 million

245
00:13:29,056 --> 00:13:32,278
and these sites would have
fewer people competing for money

246
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:36,585
and that might mean getting
more attention to your project.

247
00:13:36,585 --> 00:13:40,526
Also sometimes some
of these platforms are specialized.

248
00:13:40,526 --> 00:13:42,989
They might have a certain
geographic scope,

249
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:47,697
some social goals, there may be
different kinds of backers

250
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:50,342
associated with the different sites.

251
00:13:50,342 --> 00:13:53,452
So it's really important
to go through these things

252
00:13:53,452 --> 00:13:56,989
and decide what's best for you,
what kind of site are you looking for.

253
00:13:56,989 --> 00:14:00,740
Especially the question of what type
of backers you want to attract.

254
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:04,428
Some backers might be
on some sites and not on others

255
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,703
so this is quite an important
question to figure out.

256
00:14:06,703 --> 00:14:09,095
For example, they could have
more customer oriented ones

257
00:14:09,095 --> 00:14:10,936
that buy your product on one site

258
00:14:10,936 --> 00:14:13,892
versus people who want
to make a donation on another site.

259
00:14:13,892 --> 00:14:17,277
If you're trying to sell something
to people who want to make a donation,

260
00:14:17,277 --> 00:14:21,790
that might not be the best possible match
toward the audience that you have there.

261
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:24,347
Now, the niches could be large or small,

262
00:14:24,347 --> 00:14:28,215
so what you have to think these through
is how big is your audience?

263
00:14:28,215 --> 00:14:30,327
What kind of potential
do you want to reach?

264
00:14:30,327 --> 00:14:32,286
And what is the best site for you?

265
00:14:32,286 --> 00:14:34,209
To give you some intuition
on what this means,

266
00:14:34,209 --> 00:14:36,614
we've given you a few examples here.

267
00:14:37,164 --> 00:14:39,744
For example, a geographic focus here.

268
00:14:39,744 --> 00:14:41,922
There's this one called the Cheetah Fund

269
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:44,588
which is not accepting
new applications now,

270
00:14:44,588 --> 00:14:47,260
but was basically if you were based
in Africa, had a good idea,

271
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,526
and you made a goal, they
might actually turn around

272
00:14:49,526 --> 00:14:51,807
and match some of that.

273
00:14:51,807 --> 00:14:53,412
(Marc) Here's another one.

274
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:55,181
(Chris) This other one is this Carrotmob,
for example,

275
00:14:55,181 --> 00:14:58,234
a very interesting idea here is

276
00:14:58,234 --> 00:15:03,440
you can create a mob that then
helps out the entrepreneur.

277
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:06,749
So if you have a small hotel
and you need to have money

278
00:15:06,749 --> 00:15:09,479
for renovating the hotel,
you need people to stay in the hotel

279
00:15:09,479 --> 00:15:11,189
to become more profitable,

280
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:15,448
someone, a backer, might organize
all their friends to stay in your hotel

281
00:15:15,784 --> 00:15:18,850
and that would give you the money
that you need to make your renovation.

282
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:21,177
(Marc) So you just have to make sure
that they have a pleasant time.

283
00:15:21,177 --> 00:15:22,175
(laughing)

284
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:23,905
(Chris) That's for sure!

285
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:26,056
Then, to think about your backer profile,

286
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:31,717
basically this is just advice
to think this thing through.

287
00:15:32,137 --> 00:15:35,529
What kinds of person would you
like to attract to be your backer?

288
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:38,140
And then, trying to match that
with the backers

289
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,835
that are associated
with the various sites.

290
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:47,782
Here age, gender, interests--
we already mentioned geographical location

291
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:52,147
what websites do they frequent,
and some of their motivations.

292
00:15:52,387 --> 00:15:54,770
What do they want to do with this site?

293
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:56,789
Do the backers want equity in your company

294
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,999
or do they want early access?

295
00:15:58,999 --> 00:16:01,229
Do they want to really 
test out a cool prototype

296
00:16:01,229 --> 00:16:05,277
- or feel good about themselves?
- Yeah, some people just like to help

297
00:16:05,277 --> 00:16:08,349
(Marc) which is a great character trait,
like Chris', always trying to help people.

298
00:16:08,349 --> 00:16:09,635
(laughter)

299
00:16:09,635 --> 00:16:12,166
(Chris) That's right!
I'm always helping.

300
00:16:13,096 --> 00:16:16,213
(Marc) The backers are 
one part of the equation

301
00:16:16,213 --> 00:16:21,352
but the other part of the equation
is really the factors that attract backers

302
00:16:21,352 --> 00:16:23,626
to your site and gain the backers.

303
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:27,235
It's one thing to get people interested
but another thing to get people committed

304
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:29,510
and there's actually research that shows

305
00:16:29,510 --> 00:16:33,933
the factors that are driving
this process of gaining backers

306
00:16:33,933 --> 00:16:36,335
and there are two major
elements in particular.

307
00:16:36,335 --> 00:16:39,405
One is credibility
and the other one is appeal.

308
00:16:39,405 --> 00:16:42,455
So in terms of credibility,
it's about your professionalism

309
00:16:43,075 --> 00:16:46,194
and the feasibility of your project
that matters a lot,

310
00:16:46,194 --> 00:16:50,538
and the appeal means, is this
a relevant issue, a relevant product

311
00:16:50,538 --> 00:16:53,324
or a relevant social cause
that you're trying to address?

312
00:16:53,324 --> 00:16:57,045
And your understanding
of the customer need and the desire.

313
00:16:57,045 --> 00:16:59,937
(Chris) How compelling it is?
How compelling your story is.

314
00:16:59,937 --> 00:17:04,432
(Marc) Exactly, so you have to tell a nice
and compelling story on the website

315
00:17:04,432 --> 00:17:07,973
because people will judge you
based on how well that is communicated

316
00:17:07,973 --> 00:17:11,400
so credibility and appeal
are two extremely important factors

317
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,450
and what is underlying all of this
that I'm talking about is the notion

318
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,512
that you have to prepare very well.

319
00:17:18,512 --> 00:17:21,294
You need to understand
what is appealing to your audience

320
00:17:21,294 --> 00:17:25,272
and how can you come across
as being a very credible entrepreneur.

321
00:17:25,272 --> 00:17:28,301
This is not only important
on the crowdfunding platform.

322
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:31,222
It's important in any type
of social interaction,

323
00:17:31,222 --> 00:17:34,538
but here in particular, because
people only see you on the net.

324
00:17:34,538 --> 00:17:36,118
(Chris) That's all they get from you--

325
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:38,164
(Marc) Exactly, and you want money 
from them, you know?

326
00:17:38,994 --> 00:17:42,851
(Chris) So as Marc said, 
these things take time.

327
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:47,874
You need to budget your time
to set something up that's compelling,

328
00:17:47,874 --> 00:17:50,361
that's credible, and that's appealing.

329
00:17:51,071 --> 00:17:54,376
Tell your story and tell
your team's experience.

330
00:17:54,376 --> 00:17:56,565
(Marc) Because that engages the viewer.

331
00:17:56,565 --> 00:17:58,991
They will share your experience.

332
00:17:58,991 --> 00:18:02,657
They will understand why you're doing it,
for what cause you're doing it,

333
00:18:02,657 --> 00:18:05,284
so they get enthused like you are.

334
00:18:05,284 --> 00:18:06,732
(Chris) Right, be prepared.

335
00:18:06,732 --> 00:18:10,539
You need to make a plan 
and you need to know what to expect.

336
00:18:11,149 --> 00:18:16,440
Finally, you need to be realistic
and relevant and creative in your rewards.

337
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,680
Think through what would attract somebody.

338
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,758
If they were to give me money,
what would I give them,

339
00:18:22,758 --> 00:18:24,677
and how would they like that?

340
00:18:24,677 --> 00:18:26,636
So you can be creative about these things

341
00:18:26,636 --> 00:18:29,362
and you can sell some things, give gifts,

342
00:18:29,362 --> 00:18:31,678
depending on the kinds
of platform that you choose.

343
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:33,066
(Marc) And remember what 
we said in marketing,

344
00:18:33,066 --> 00:18:35,182
because this is, in a way, also marketing.

345
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:39,231
It's like spend imagination
instead of money, in that sense.

346
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:41,333
Spend imagination
and your creativity and understanding.

347
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:46,882
What type of rewards might be particularly
appealing to your target backers?

348
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:50,731
(Chris) So bringing it back full circle,
we think that crowdfunding

349
00:18:50,731 --> 00:18:54,530
is a very important topic
for entrepreneurs today.

350
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,577
That's also why it's
a major part of this MOOC

351
00:18:56,577 --> 00:18:59,339
and remember, you are developing
your own crowdfunding campaign

352
00:18:59,339 --> 00:19:03,105
here in this MOOC
which allows you to raise funds,

353
00:19:03,105 --> 00:19:05,298
to get your company off the ground,

354
00:19:05,298 --> 00:19:08,226
but it also allows you to win
some additional funding

355
00:19:08,226 --> 00:19:12,602
because we secured some funds to actually
give the top performers in this course

356
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:16,258
the possibility to win
$2,500 in seed funding.

357
00:19:16,397 --> 00:19:17,676
That's quite nice, no?

358
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:20,524
We're going to have
a whole little tutorial

359
00:19:20,524 --> 00:19:24,078
about this specific details
of how to get onto the platforms

360
00:19:24,078 --> 00:19:26,984
and how to actually integrate
the course material

361
00:19:26,984 --> 00:19:29,251
with your crowdfunding campaign.

362
00:19:29,251 --> 00:19:31,661
We're going to do that later this week.

363
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,703
Just as a footnote here, I think
this might be the only MOOC

364
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:37,646
where you can actually win some money
by learning something!

365
00:19:37,646 --> 00:19:39,477
This is the only MOOC
where we pay <i>you</i>!

366
00:19:39,477 --> 00:19:41,422
(laughter)
Exactly.

367
00:19:41,422 --> 00:19:44,776
So stay with us and keep on pushing!

368
00:19:44,776 --> 00:19:47,085
This is the segment on crowdfunding

369
00:19:47,085 --> 00:19:49,603
and there will be other great segments
on financing coming up.
