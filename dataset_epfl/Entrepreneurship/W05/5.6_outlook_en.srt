00:00:05,374 --> 00:00:07,951
Welcome back to our final, final segment

2
00:00:07,951 --> 00:00:10,102
for our MOOC,
<i>Launching New Ventures</i>.

3
00:00:10,102 --> 00:00:11,705
Time went by quickly!

4
00:00:11,705 --> 00:00:13,640
Five weeks of material with you,

5
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:16,563
and we hope it has been fun
and educational at the same time.

6
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:18,679
We're going to just review
a little bit of the stuff

7
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:20,387
at the very beginning of the MOOC

8
00:00:20,387 --> 00:00:22,025
and then talk about some of the things

9
00:00:22,025 --> 00:00:24,534
that we didn't have time to put in
during the five weeks.

10
00:00:24,534 --> 00:00:27,456
Exactly, so when you remember
what we discussed

11
00:00:27,456 --> 00:00:29,064
about what entrepreneurship is,

12
00:00:29,064 --> 00:00:32,887
I think there are some key learnings
that you can draw from these examples.

13
00:00:32,887 --> 00:00:35,138
For instance, entrepreneurship
is often defined

14
00:00:35,138 --> 00:00:37,667
as bringing together resources
to create value.

15
00:00:37,667 --> 00:00:39,985
We talked mostly about
financial wealth creation here

16
00:00:39,985 --> 00:00:42,500
because this is a concern
to many of you out there,

17
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,582
but it could also be
social wealth creation,

18
00:00:44,582 --> 00:00:46,256
where you are helping others

19
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:50,327
to get jobs, to have a better life,
etcetera, so in that sense,

20
00:00:50,327 --> 00:00:53,258
what we discussed is an important
aspect of entrepreneurship,

21
00:00:53,258 --> 00:00:55,279
but it's not the whole universe,
which is fine,

22
00:00:55,279 --> 00:00:58,202
because one MOOC has five weeks,
and that's the time we have.

23
00:00:58,202 --> 00:01:00,452
This said, remember also,

24
00:01:00,452 --> 00:01:03,441
entrepreneurship might sound
like a hip and cool concept,

25
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:06,396
which we think it is,
but it has some ancient roots.

26
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:12,112
In the 18th century an Englishman
called Cantillon observed some person

27
00:01:12,112 --> 00:01:14,300
that Chris will talk about in a second,

28
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,130
and used the word <i>entrepreneur</i>.

29
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:19,535
he coined this term to define
entrepreneurship in that sense.

30
00:01:19,535 --> 00:01:22,589
Right, so if you think
about the Marco Polo example

31
00:01:22,589 --> 00:01:24,792
from the very first segment,

32
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:26,951
he was a merchant adventurer.

33
00:01:26,951 --> 00:01:29,493
He went off and thought
there might be a spice route,

34
00:01:29,493 --> 00:01:30,963
but he wasn't really sure

35
00:01:30,963 --> 00:01:32,856
if he was going to be able
to make any money.

36
00:01:32,856 --> 00:01:35,145
He undertook a lot of risk
and went out on a limb.

37
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:36,622
He got someone else to finance him.

38
00:01:36,622 --> 00:01:41,314
He went and was able to return and make it
a profitable venture in the end.

39
00:01:41,314 --> 00:01:43,271
Exactly, and Cantillon
observed people like this,

40
00:01:43,271 --> 00:01:47,799
so in a way, this idea of going boldly
where no man or woman has gone before,

41
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,018
so in that sense, keep
that spirit of an adventurer,

42
00:01:51,018 --> 00:01:53,782
and also, enjoy
your entrepreneurial journey.

43
00:01:54,091 --> 00:01:57,311
So, in the MOOC we touched
on three perspectives on entrepreneurship,

44
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:59,692
the first being
the entrepreneurial mindset,

45
00:01:59,692 --> 00:02:01,615
how the entrepreneur thinks.

46
00:02:01,615 --> 00:02:05,704
Taking risks, seeking opportunities
regardless of the resources available.

47
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:07,852
This is not just a small company thing.

48
00:02:07,852 --> 00:02:12,644
This could be applicable to a startup,
to a small or medium enterprise,

49
00:02:12,644 --> 00:02:14,475
or even to a large corporation.

50
00:02:14,475 --> 00:02:17,204
And especially important
for the large corporations now as well,

51
00:02:17,204 --> 00:02:19,297
because these companies
need to be competitive

52
00:02:19,297 --> 00:02:21,421
and have to look for new business.

53
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:23,664
We also talked about
entrepreneurial events

54
00:02:23,664 --> 00:02:26,234
like the launching event,
the market entry event,

55
00:02:26,234 --> 00:02:29,032
and we talked about
the entrepreneurship process

56
00:02:29,032 --> 00:02:31,411
which is a process that walks
through multiple stages

57
00:02:31,411 --> 00:02:35,013
and we took actually this process view
in order to structure our MOOC.

58
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:37,234
So remember, the five weeks we did.

59
00:02:37,234 --> 00:02:39,646
We started off
with opportunity identification.

60
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:40,732
Exactly, Marc!

61
00:02:40,732 --> 00:02:45,589
So, in week two we focused on both
identifying and evaluating

62
00:02:45,589 --> 00:02:47,556
business opportunities for the ventures.

63
00:02:47,556 --> 00:02:49,829
The topic of week three 
was entrepreneurial marketing,

64
00:02:49,829 --> 00:02:52,560
how do you craft
a compelling marketing campaign?

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,929
Then in week four we discussed
venture financing needs.

66
00:02:56,929 --> 00:03:00,242
Finally, in week five we talked
about profiting from innovation.

67
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:03,933
Keep in mind it's one thing to create
something new, something cool,

68
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,852
but another thing
to profit from it financially.

69
00:03:07,725 --> 00:03:11,672
There were many things 
we couldn't fit into this five week MOOC.

70
00:03:11,672 --> 00:03:14,378
For example, how to build a great team,

71
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:17,799
how to design your organizations,
your systems, your structures,

72
00:03:17,799 --> 00:03:21,604
your incentives, how do you design
a good business model?

73
00:03:21,604 --> 00:03:24,667
Exactly, and there were other types
of ventures that we couldn't talk about

74
00:03:24,667 --> 00:03:26,001
like mission-driven startups,

75
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:28,347
but we encourage you
to check out the Coursera platform

76
00:03:28,347 --> 00:03:31,367
because they have other great MOOCs
where you can actually learn

77
00:03:31,367 --> 00:03:33,706
about these types of issues,
these types of topics.

78
00:03:34,663 --> 00:03:37,755
So, looking forward,
there are lots of opportunities

79
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:40,114
to expand your firm, to grow your firm,

80
00:03:40,114 --> 00:03:42,577
if you think about
the financing angle on this,

81
00:03:42,577 --> 00:03:47,678
of course, we focused a lot last week
on the early stage, seed funding,

82
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:50,102
- and some of the intermediate--
- There might be other ways.

83
00:03:50,102 --> 00:03:52,039
Once you grow your firm, expand your firm,

84
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:55,218
you could do an IPO
which is an initial public offering.

85
00:03:55,218 --> 00:03:57,200
You could bring your company
to the stock market,

86
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:59,926
and that gives you additional funds
to grow your company even further

87
00:03:59,926 --> 00:04:02,409
to do international market
entries, etcetera, etcetera.

88
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,934
Right, so if that happens to you, then
of course, don't forget the little people.

89
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:12,005
Exactly, we could even label our building
here in Lausanne after you with your name.

90
00:04:12,908 --> 00:04:15,991
We can understand you're fully excited
about growing your venture,

91
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:18,916
expanding your venture, but don't forget
there are also some assignments

92
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:21,613
that you still need to do
in order to complete this course.

93
00:04:21,613 --> 00:04:24,591
If you look at this slide here,
it will give you some information

94
00:04:24,591 --> 00:04:27,151
about what you should be thinking
about in the near future.

95
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:31,005
This might be 
the very final session of the MOOC,

96
00:04:31,005 --> 00:04:34,471
but we want to be in touch with you
and want you to keep in touch with us,

97
00:04:34,471 --> 00:04:37,776
so we've prepared a couple of options
so that you can link up with us.

98
00:04:37,776 --> 00:04:41,058
So, what we have set up
is a Facebook group

99
00:04:41,058 --> 00:04:43,823
which many of you, or most of you,
are already involved in.

100
00:04:43,823 --> 00:04:47,383
You can stay on there,
you can tweet us, of course,

101
00:04:47,383 --> 00:04:52,433
and we will set up a LinkedIn group
for the alumni of this course,

102
00:04:52,433 --> 00:04:53,909
for anyone who finishes the course,

103
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,494
so that you can keep touch
with each other, and with us.

104
00:04:56,494 --> 00:04:59,303
Thanks again for joining us in this MOOC.

105
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:02,791
It has been an entrepreneurial journey
for you and also for us.

106
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,299
We hope you've enjoyed it
as much as we have.

107
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:08,331
There's one thing in the end
that we want to wish you,

108
00:05:08,331 --> 00:05:10,740
(in unison) which is good luck
with your venture!

109
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,603
That was almost a perfect
[inaudible], wasn't it?

110
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:14,142
(laughing)

111
00:05:14,142 --> 00:05:15,662
Good luck! Bye bye.

112
00:05:18,776 --> 00:05:20,058
That was a fun session.

113
00:05:20,058 --> 00:05:22,714
Yeah, actually that was OK.
The five weeks went by pretty quickly.

114
00:05:22,714 --> 00:05:24,747
When you think about it,
it was five weeks only

115
00:05:24,747 --> 00:05:26,706
- and it's already gone.
- Yeah, man, wow.

116
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:29,654
I actually want to show you something

117
00:05:29,654 --> 00:05:31,294
now that we're done with this course.

118
00:05:31,294 --> 00:05:33,298
I kind of got inspired by the class itself

119
00:05:33,298 --> 00:05:34,917
and made a little invention.

120
00:05:36,642 --> 00:05:39,663
I was wondering if you think
there might be a business opportunity here

121
00:05:39,663 --> 00:05:42,633
because this is a little time machine.

122
00:05:42,633 --> 00:05:44,082
- What?
- Yeah.

123
00:05:44,082 --> 00:05:47,357
- So we'd like to go back
- Like the <i>Back to the Future</i> stuff?

124
00:05:47,357 --> 00:05:50,406
Yeah, exactly, so all you need to do
is push this button,

125
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:52,502
and we can go back, 
maybe to the time of Marco Polo.

126
00:05:52,502 --> 00:05:53,820
No, you tried it?

127
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,677
I haven't tried it yet.
I figured I'd test it out right now.

128
00:05:56,677 --> 00:05:58,920
Just push this button right here...

129
00:06:00,174 --> 00:06:01,910
This will not work.

130
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:04,715
(both) Oooooh!

131
00:06:07,176 --> 00:06:09,493
