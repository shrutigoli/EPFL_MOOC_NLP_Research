00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:06,720
Welcome back to Module Five

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,440
This is segment 5.4
<i>Growing and Scaling Your Business</i>.

3
00:00:12,337 --> 00:00:13,898
What are we going to talk about today?

4
00:00:13,898 --> 00:00:18,160
We're going to discuss 
different aspects of growth,

5
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,067
including how to keep track 
of your growth.

6
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:24,619
Knowing when to pivot.
What does pivoting mean?

7
00:00:24,619 --> 00:00:28,088
What are the different stages of growth
and the challenges of growth?

8
00:00:28,088 --> 00:00:30,730
What does it mean 
to scale up your business?

9
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:35,367
And to think about your team
and your organizational growth,

10
00:00:35,367 --> 00:00:39,376
and then finally your managerial focus
versus your founder focus,

11
00:00:39,376 --> 00:00:41,875
once you get to be of a certain size.

12
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:46,428
So, as we just mentioned,
we’re going to talk about

13
00:00:46,428 --> 00:00:49,384
different ways of measuring growth.

14
00:00:49,384 --> 00:00:52,555
Now, there are lots of different
aspects to think about

15
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:54,494
when you're measuring growth,

16
00:00:54,494 --> 00:00:57,259
and I've sketched out a few things here
that you can think about.

17
00:00:57,259 --> 00:01:02,016
Not every single business is going to use
every single one of these things.

18
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:06,322
But try and adapt this list
to your own circumstances.

19
00:01:06,322 --> 00:01:10,502
So, obviously the quickest 
and easiest way to think about growth

20
00:01:10,502 --> 00:01:13,280
is how many total users are you serving?

21
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,868
How many people have signed up
to use your service?

22
00:01:15,868 --> 00:01:19,425
How many people 
are your customers overall,

23
00:01:19,425 --> 00:01:21,014
your overall customer base?

24
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:23,383
And then we have total active users

25
00:01:23,383 --> 00:01:26,490
because in some cases
people might sign up for service,

26
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:31,320
but then they may not actually go
and use the service

27
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,938
once they’ve signed up.

28
00:01:32,938 --> 00:01:35,505
So we want to keep track
of both total users,

29
00:01:35,505 --> 00:01:37,702
which is everyone
who is signed up, somehow;

30
00:01:37,702 --> 00:01:40,128
and total active users,

31
00:01:40,128 --> 00:01:42,911
and those are the people 
who are coming back

32
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:46,521
every once in a while to use your service.

33
00:01:46,521 --> 00:01:48,826
Now, we have total paying customers.

34
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:51,838
Here we have to think about
the business model a little bit.

35
00:01:51,838 --> 00:01:53,804
Who are your customers?
Who are the users?

36
00:01:53,804 --> 00:01:55,613
They may not be the same people.

37
00:01:55,613 --> 00:01:59,301
Who is paying for the service
that you’re offering or the product?

38
00:01:59,301 --> 00:02:03,352
In which case you want to track
how many paying customers do you have.

39
00:02:04,111 --> 00:02:05,642
Total revenues, that’s pretty obvious.

40
00:02:05,642 --> 00:02:09,141
We talked a lot about that
in the last module.

41
00:02:09,141 --> 00:02:12,660
Then we have the couple of things
that are new here,

42
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:16,824
which are a little bit interesting:
conversion rate of free to paying users.

43
00:02:16,824 --> 00:02:21,324
So in other words, in some businesses, 
you might offer something for free,

44
00:02:22,426 --> 00:02:23,864
just to get it off the ground.

45
00:02:23,864 --> 00:02:28,174
To build a user base 
or to get some initial customers

46
00:02:28,174 --> 00:02:31,434
so that you can then tell everyone
you have more customers, etc.

47
00:02:31,434 --> 00:02:33,663
So you may offer
some things for free at first,

48
00:02:33,663 --> 00:02:35,778
or you may have a sort
of free-mium model.

49
00:02:35,778 --> 00:02:39,380
Free-mium model’s where you have
different types of services.

50
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,714
You have the free service,
which is the basic service.

51
00:02:41,714 --> 00:02:44,537
Then people who want more 
can pay for more.

52
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:46,320
The so called premium people.

53
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,185
So the question is 
what percentage of those people

54
00:02:50,185 --> 00:02:54,347
that start out free, switch to paying?

55
00:02:54,347 --> 00:02:56,448
And you might want to track that overtime.

56
00:02:56,448 --> 00:03:01,264
Churn rate is when you have 
customers who come and go,

57
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:04,017
and they’re your customer 
for a while, then they leave.

58
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:07,796
And so you want to track 
how many customers,

59
00:03:07,796 --> 00:03:11,592
what percentage 
of your customers actually leave

60
00:03:11,592 --> 00:03:14,336
and quit the system somehow.

61
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:20,467
And then finally, the last item here is
customer acquisition payback period.

62
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:23,294
So it might cost you something,
it will cost you something

63
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:25,327
to acquire customers.

64
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:28,004
And so the question
that you have to ask yourself is,

65
00:03:28,004 --> 00:03:31,534
"Well, how much does it cost 
for me to get a customer

66
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:35,635
versus how much do I gain
from the customer?"

67
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:37,581
Assuming you have
some kind of, for example,

68
00:03:37,581 --> 00:03:39,694
a subscription model
or something like that.

69
00:03:39,694 --> 00:03:43,674
Or someone pays for unlimited usage
of some product or service.

70
00:03:43,674 --> 00:03:47,059
Then the question is 
you know if it cost you 100 dollars

71
00:03:47,059 --> 00:03:52,257
to acquire the customer
and the person pays $10 a month,

72
00:03:52,257 --> 00:03:57,473
that means it’s going to take you
10 months just to pay back

73
00:03:57,473 --> 00:04:02,552
to recoup the initial cost
of acquiring that customer.

74
00:04:02,552 --> 00:04:05,791
So basically, what I’m asking you
to do here is, with the growth metrics,

75
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:08,235
is to kind of track this things 
for your business,

76
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:10,487
adapt this for the kind 
of business that you have,

77
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:13,625
and then track this overtime
to see how things are working out.

78
00:04:14,842 --> 00:04:18,102
Tracking those growth metrics 
will help you decide

79
00:04:18,102 --> 00:04:20,340
whether you need to pivot.

80
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:22,904
Pivoting is a term that people use

81
00:04:22,904 --> 00:04:28,153
when you change one or more aspects
of your business model.

82
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:30,583
So you're going to make 
some changes here,

83
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:36,105
and you need to understand 
those growth metrics to decide

84
00:04:36,105 --> 00:04:39,669
whether you need to make some changes.

85
00:04:40,896 --> 00:04:44,122
Now, certain schools of thought say

86
00:04:44,122 --> 00:04:49,007
that you should use 
the following method for pivoting.

87
00:04:49,007 --> 00:04:51,454
And here what you have
is rapid prototyping.

88
00:04:51,454 --> 00:04:54,111
So you want to come up 
with something relatively quickly

89
00:04:54,111 --> 00:04:57,780
that you can show 
and demonstrate to other people.

90
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,537
And that might lead 
to a so-called minimum viable product.

91
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:05,995
Minimum viable product
basically means it’s the smallest unit

92
00:05:05,995 --> 00:05:09,462
that you need to have no extra bells 
and whistles that you can show.

93
00:05:09,462 --> 00:05:11,514
So it’s like your first prototype

94
00:05:11,514 --> 00:05:13,993
--or it could be your second
or third prototype as well--

95
00:05:13,993 --> 00:05:16,266
but you got to pull up together
a kind of a product

96
00:05:16,266 --> 00:05:18,925
that’s good for demonstration purposes.

97
00:05:18,925 --> 00:05:21,946
And then you want 
an immediately illicit feedback

98
00:05:21,946 --> 00:05:25,178
from potential customers, 
potential users,

99
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,430
other eco-system participants;
the whole supply chain.

100
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,755
You should demonstrate
and show this to people,

101
00:05:30,755 --> 00:05:32,482
and you should get feedback.

102
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:35,337
And then you need
to revisit your assumptions.

103
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:38,532
And if something is not working,
then you need to make adjustments.

104
00:05:38,532 --> 00:05:40,325
Now some people make a distinction.

105
00:05:40,325 --> 00:05:43,148
They draw a distinction 
between a small adjustment,

106
00:05:44,298 --> 00:05:46,810
which could be called an iteration
or something like that,

107
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,381
and a large adjustment 
which could be called the pivot.

108
00:05:49,381 --> 00:05:52,627
But in any case,
if something isn’t working,

109
00:05:52,627 --> 00:05:55,166
and also your growth metrics
that I’ve just showed you

110
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,483
will also inform that,

111
00:05:56,483 --> 00:05:58,503
then you need to make 
some kind of adjustment,

112
00:05:58,503 --> 00:06:02,703
and that adjustment 
is usually called some kind of pivot.

113
00:06:02,703 --> 00:06:04,821
And then what you want to do
is an iterative process,

114
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:09,053
you want to repeat those steps 
until you come up with something

115
00:06:09,053 --> 00:06:11,550
that works for you 
and that works for the people

116
00:06:11,550 --> 00:06:14,321
that you’ve demonstrated to;
so in other words, it’s a successful idea.

117
00:06:14,335 --> 00:06:16,596
A successful product or service.

118
00:06:17,232 --> 00:06:22,899
Given what we just discussed, 
you may ask yourself: when should I pivot?

119
00:06:22,899 --> 00:06:26,279
And the answer to that question
is a little bit complex

120
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:29,442
because there's no one answer saying,
"Oh, you must pivot now."

121
00:06:29,442 --> 00:06:31,055
But what I’ve done here is

122
00:06:31,055 --> 00:06:33,928
I’ve drawn up 
a little laundry list of items

123
00:06:33,928 --> 00:06:37,288
that you should consider before pivoting.

124
00:06:38,158 --> 00:06:42,898
So if you’ve made 
some big assumptions about your market,

125
00:06:42,898 --> 00:06:46,311
about what customers like or need

126
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:48,683
when your primary assumptions are wrong.

127
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:52,065
So you’'ve been confronted
in the prior slide

128
00:06:52,065 --> 00:06:54,426
with something, with feedback that says

129
00:06:54,426 --> 00:06:56,563
"Gee, I thought people 
would pay for this,"

130
00:06:58,353 --> 00:06:59,669
or other aspects of it,

131
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,750
then you have to say, "OK, 
my primary assumption was wrong.

132
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:07,266
I might need to think
about something different here,"

133
00:07:07,266 --> 00:07:09,487
"I might need to modify what I’m doing."

134
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:12,515
And there are different variations
of this in my list here.

135
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:15,195
Customers have different needs
than what you thought.

136
00:07:15,195 --> 00:07:17,146
That’s one assumption that you make.

137
00:07:17,146 --> 00:07:19,656
You can have other assumptions
about demographics, etc.

138
00:07:19,656 --> 00:07:22,507
But customers is a big one, 
and if you find out

139
00:07:22,507 --> 00:07:24,767
that they have different needs
than what you’ve thought,

140
00:07:24,767 --> 00:07:29,073
then that’s a very clear signal
that you may want to pivot.

141
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:30,478
If your environment is changing.

142
00:07:30,478 --> 00:07:32,458
What does that mean
"environment's changing?"

143
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:36,041
Well, what that means is example,
you have new competition.

144
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:39,959
Some well-funded competitor
enters the same space that you’re in.

145
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,804
When new regulations are introduced,
or other sort of government interventions.

146
00:07:44,804 --> 00:07:47,001
If macro-economics changes 
are taking place.

147
00:07:47,001 --> 00:07:48,206
So in other words,

148
00:07:48,206 --> 00:07:51,346
if there’s a recession that’s starting
after you started your company,

149
00:07:51,346 --> 00:07:54,580
or a giant boom so people 
have more money to spend,

150
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:58,640
that’s also something that cause you
to rethink what you're doing.

151
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,183
The key one here: when no one wants
to pay for your product.

152
00:08:02,183 --> 00:08:03,994
I think this is 
a very common one, actually.

153
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,941
Either directly or indirectly.

154
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:08,219
In other words,
you trying to sell your product

155
00:08:08,219 --> 00:08:09,920
and people don’t want to buy it.

156
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:13,504
You try and make money from advertising,

157
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:16,495
and getting some kind 
of indirect payment for your product,

158
00:08:16,495 --> 00:08:19,572
and no one wants to pay for advertising.

159
00:08:19,572 --> 00:08:21,529
So that’s a very clear signal.

160
00:08:21,529 --> 00:08:25,073
Something about the customers
and something about your product offering

161
00:08:25,073 --> 00:08:27,153
that you might want to rethink.

162
00:08:27,153 --> 00:08:29,990
Or another very common one,
when your sale cycles are too long.

163
00:08:29,990 --> 00:08:33,788
So in other words, you thought
you would be able to get out there

164
00:08:33,788 --> 00:08:35,903
and sell these things right away.

165
00:08:35,904 --> 00:08:38,209
The people would jump on,
and it turns out that you need

166
00:08:38,209 --> 00:08:42,765
to really, really talk and educate 
your customers for a very long time

167
00:08:42,765 --> 00:08:45,784
before they’re willing to actually pay.

168
00:08:45,784 --> 00:08:48,799
Some aspects here,
and you could have other aspects too,

169
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:52,967
but these are things that cause you
to rethink what you’re doing

170
00:08:53,403 --> 00:08:58,292
and make you wonder whether or not
there is certain aspects of your product,

171
00:08:58,292 --> 00:09:02,193
your service value proposition,
your partnership, etc.,

172
00:09:02,193 --> 00:09:04,752
that you may want to rethink.

173
00:09:05,415 --> 00:09:09,664
So once you’ve arrived
at something that works for you,

174
00:09:09,664 --> 00:09:12,694
you’ve pivoted to the point
where you think you’ve got a good idea,

175
00:09:12,694 --> 00:09:14,339
and it seems to be working well,

176
00:09:14,339 --> 00:09:16,584
you may want to think about scale.

177
00:09:16,584 --> 00:09:18,934
So, what does scaling mean?

178
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:22,886
Scaling is achieving a higher sales volume

179
00:09:22,886 --> 00:09:25,585
using the same infrastructure.

180
00:09:27,329 --> 00:09:31,538
In other words, 
if you have one salesperson,

181
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:35,074
and that person goes out
and gets customers for you,

182
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:39,176
and that person can get one customer,

183
00:09:39,176 --> 00:09:41,823
it may take a year
to get that first customer.

184
00:09:41,823 --> 00:09:43,253
And then to get a second customer,

185
00:09:43,253 --> 00:09:45,449
that person might spend
another year to get a second,

186
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:48,032
so that’s not a very "scalable business"
in some sense, right?

187
00:09:48,032 --> 00:09:52,989
If you have to hire a new person
to get another customer,

188
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:55,832
then that’s not achieving high scale.

189
00:09:55,832 --> 00:09:59,494
So scale is really thinking
about bringing your sales volume up

190
00:09:59,494 --> 00:10:01,876
using the same infrastructure
that you have,

191
00:10:01,876 --> 00:10:05,735
so that one salesperson
may be able to get 10 customers

192
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:08,387
or a hundred, a thousand,
or a million customers.

193
00:10:09,677 --> 00:10:12,652
So what does it take to achieve scale?

194
00:10:12,652 --> 00:10:16,712
Well, the first thing it takes 
is a back-end that works efficiently.

195
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:20,136
So back-end is something
that the customer doesn’t see.

196
00:10:20,136 --> 00:10:23,489
So it could be order fulfillment,
delivery, etc.

197
00:10:23,489 --> 00:10:26,873
Those kinds of things 
need to be ready for high volume.

198
00:10:28,133 --> 00:10:30,799
You need to understand
the potential size of the market

199
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:33,050
and think about how big it is.

200
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:35,652
And then having the marginal cost

201
00:10:35,652 --> 00:10:39,459
of gaining more sales be relatively low.

202
00:10:39,459 --> 00:10:42,023
So in other words, using 
that example, the salespeople—

203
00:10:42,823 --> 00:10:46,042
if you need to hire a new person
for every customer that you have,

204
00:10:46,042 --> 00:10:50,434
then that’s obviously
not a very scalable business

205
00:10:50,434 --> 00:10:53,274
because your marginal cost
of getting additional customer

206
00:10:53,274 --> 00:10:55,458
is very, very, very high.

207
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,632
So you might want to think

208
00:10:57,632 --> 00:11:00,795
about how low you can bring down
that marginal cost.

209
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:04,477
You need to be not very labor intensive
for getting new customers.

210
00:11:05,337 --> 00:11:08,395
Which is related to the next point 
which is knowing the whole sales cycle.

211
00:11:08,395 --> 00:11:11,755
How long do people need to think
before they’re willing to actually pay

212
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,594
for the product or service
that you’ve got in mind here?

213
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:19,241
Furthermore, you have to design 
the product or service,

214
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:23,093
and market the product or service
with large numbers in mind.

215
00:11:23,093 --> 00:11:25,172
So not a one-off type thing.

216
00:11:25,172 --> 00:11:27,368
Of course in the prototyping phase,
no problem, but then,

217
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:30,505
when you get to the scale phase, 
then you want to make sure

218
00:11:30,505 --> 00:11:33,820
that your product 
can handle multiple users,

219
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:36,014
at the same time, multiple customers.

220
00:11:36,014 --> 00:11:37,657
Same thing with marketing to them.

221
00:11:38,275 --> 00:11:40,679
And then, we’re going to talk about
just a little bit more,

222
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:43,673
is making sure the organization itself
can handle growth.

223
00:11:43,673 --> 00:11:46,433
In other words, 
what kind of organization do you need

224
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:50,075
to be able to gain large sales volume?

225
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:53,786
OK, here’s a little warning for you here.

226
00:11:53,786 --> 00:11:55,246
This is a very interesting quote.

227
00:11:55,246 --> 00:12:00,425
Start-ups need 2 to 3 times longer
to validate their market

228
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:03,053
than most founders expect.

229
00:12:03,053 --> 00:12:07,284
This underestimation creates
the pressure to scale prematurely.

230
00:12:07,284 --> 00:12:10,836
I think this is very good words
of wisdom here.

231
00:12:11,618 --> 00:12:15,035
Because I've seen it myself 
in different ventures.

232
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:19,747
Validating your market takes a while.

233
00:12:19,747 --> 00:12:22,280
Trying to understand
where you’re going to end up

234
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:25,474
and pivoting to the right place
takes some time.

235
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:29,454
And then when you have the pressure
to scale prematurely,

236
00:12:29,454 --> 00:12:32,213
that means you’re not ready for the scale.

237
00:12:32,213 --> 00:12:35,038
And that means you either
not going to achieve it

238
00:12:35,617 --> 00:12:38,272
or even if you somehow 
manage to get all these customers

239
00:12:38,272 --> 00:12:40,054
you’re going to disappoint them

240
00:12:40,054 --> 00:12:43,448
because you’re not going to be ready
to handle them.

241
00:12:43,448 --> 00:12:46,642
So either way, be warned

242
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:50,856
that there is a time lag here
to validate the market

243
00:12:50,856 --> 00:12:53,610
and then you want to go ahead
and go for the scale.

244
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:57,937
Alright let’s look at this model,
Greiner's Model of startup growth.

245
00:12:57,937 --> 00:13:02,624
This is a very interesting 
and insightful work.

246
00:13:02,624 --> 00:13:05,544
Basically, if you look at the left axis,

247
00:13:05,544 --> 00:13:08,077
what we have is the size 
of the organization,

248
00:13:08,077 --> 00:13:11,697
starting at small
and going up to large;

249
00:13:13,254 --> 00:13:16,957
and then if you look at this x-axis here,

250
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:19,632
then what you have is
the ages of the organization

251
00:13:19,632 --> 00:13:22,890
starting off at young 
and going up to mature.

252
00:13:23,156 --> 00:13:26,026
And as you might imagine,
there is a correlation

253
00:13:26,026 --> 00:13:28,753
between the size of the organization
and the age of the organization

254
00:13:28,753 --> 00:13:32,479
since organizations
tend to get bigger overtime.

255
00:13:33,343 --> 00:13:35,432
At least the ones that survive.

256
00:13:35,432 --> 00:13:38,963
Now, what we’re going to talk about here

257
00:13:38,963 --> 00:13:41,757
are the different stages of growth.

258
00:13:41,757 --> 00:13:47,298
So the very, very, very early stages here
is what we call <i>creativity</i>.

259
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:52,767
And then there’s going to be 
different crises,

260
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:57,097
and the different crises 
is a transition period

261
00:13:57,097 --> 00:13:59,946
between one stage and the next stage.

262
00:14:01,823 --> 00:14:04,605
So this first stage
is all about creativity,

263
00:14:04,605 --> 00:14:07,230
and then there’s a crises of leadership

264
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:10,495
which leads 
to slightly bigger organization.

265
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:14,877
And then we have this second stage
which is called the <i>direction</i>;

266
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:17,379
and we grow further,

267
00:14:17,379 --> 00:14:20,969
and then we finally have
in a crisis of autonomy.

268
00:14:20,969 --> 00:14:25,764
And then we have a case
where we have <i>delegation.</i>

269
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,592
It’s where the founders
have to step back a little bit.

270
00:14:28,592 --> 00:14:32,572
So the first phase
is really about pure creativity,

271
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:34,860
and what you might want
to call almost chaos.

272
00:14:36,059 --> 00:14:40,098
The second stage is 
about finding your footing and growing

273
00:14:40,098 --> 00:14:42,816
and then finally, 
in this third, not finally,

274
00:14:42,816 --> 00:14:46,358
but this third stage, 
you have <i>delegation</i>.

275
00:14:46,358 --> 00:14:51,215
In other words, you have to impose
some kind of management structure

276
00:14:51,215 --> 00:14:53,452
on your organization as it grows.

277
00:14:54,316 --> 00:14:56,668
Big literature in sociology on this.

278
00:14:57,300 --> 00:15:01,608
Very, very difficult
to have an organization grow

279
00:15:01,608 --> 00:15:04,157
in an uncoordinated fashion.

280
00:15:04,157 --> 00:15:07,572
And so you end up
with a crisis of control, eventually,

281
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:11,520
and then you move on to the next phase
which is the <i>coordination</i> phase,

282
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,121
getting much bigger,

283
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:16,372
and then you turn into 
some kind of bureaucracy

284
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:18,956
and that’s where 
the red tape crises comes from.

285
00:15:18,956 --> 00:15:22,319
And then, you are in a stage 
of <i>collaboration</i>

286
00:15:22,328 --> 00:15:24,400
in a much more mature company.

287
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,464
So what you see here is

288
00:15:26,464 --> 00:15:32,897
that the company starts off 
very small and very disorganized,

289
00:15:32,897 --> 00:15:34,267
I would say.

290
00:15:34,267 --> 00:15:38,762
And then overtime, as the company grows,

291
00:15:38,762 --> 00:15:42,772
there are certain kinds
of organizational structures

292
00:15:42,772 --> 00:15:45,789
and controls that need to be imposed

293
00:15:45,789 --> 00:15:48,826
to be able to handle the growth.

294
00:15:49,681 --> 00:15:51,783
Here’s another way of thinking about this.

295
00:15:52,736 --> 00:15:57,637
This slide is focusing on the early stages

296
00:15:57,651 --> 00:16:01,202
of the team of the company.

297
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,038
Basically, what you can see on this slide

298
00:16:04,038 --> 00:16:08,890
is that we’re starting 
with the business idea here on the left

299
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:14,094
and then we’re going to overtime progress.

300
00:16:14,094 --> 00:16:19,465
So there’s going to be an idea at first
that would turn into a business plan,

301
00:16:20,162 --> 00:16:22,503
and then the company will be founded,

302
00:16:23,983 --> 00:16:27,852
and then the company
is more well-established.

303
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:31,073
So this is a time progression.

304
00:16:31,742 --> 00:16:37,568
Now if you think about this in terms 
of the human resource development

305
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:40,433
one of the ideas here is

306
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:45,489
that you have to be sort 
of a jack-of-all-trades at first.

307
00:16:45,489 --> 00:16:47,289
We call it a decathlete.

308
00:16:48,597 --> 00:16:53,286
And then overtime,
you specialize a little bit.

309
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:55,654
And so the founders become
instead of decathletes,

310
00:16:55,654 --> 00:16:57,198
they become pentathletes.

311
00:16:57,753 --> 00:17:00,718
And then the other team members
are more like the triathletes.

312
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,876
And then eventually,

313
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:06,438
the founders are triathletes,
and everyone else is a specialist.

314
00:17:06,438 --> 00:17:11,258
So overtime, again,
consistent with the prior page,

315
00:17:11,258 --> 00:17:17,169
there is a specialization aspect 
once the company is growing.

316
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:20,170
And that's down here too, 
under the organizational development.

317
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:23,809
We start off with a so-called 
one-man show, one-woman show.

318
00:17:24,865 --> 00:17:27,559
And that might turn into a few people.

319
00:17:28,214 --> 00:17:31,272
And then we have
the functional division of labor.

320
00:17:32,402 --> 00:17:36,545
And then finally, we have increasing
institutionalization and specialization.

321
00:17:37,537 --> 00:17:39,520
And if you think about tacit knowledge

322
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,437
that’s knowledge that’s hard 
to describe and codify.

323
00:17:43,437 --> 00:17:47,335
Tacit knowledge is only in the heads 
of the founders at the very early stage.

324
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:50,207
So that’s the little f’s are for.

325
00:17:52,499 --> 00:17:54,743
Eventually, the tacit knowledge is shared

326
00:17:54,743 --> 00:17:57,564
because you can learn 
by doing with the team.

327
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:03,898
And then finally, what happens is
after a while you get into some routines

328
00:18:03,898 --> 00:18:06,930
and those routines actually help you

329
00:18:08,701 --> 00:18:10,230
exploit your knowledge

330
00:18:10,230 --> 00:18:13,717
that’s why they call it;
it's <i>codified and stored in</i> routines.

331
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,722
So basically, the idea here is 
that there’s a progression overtime

332
00:18:21,722 --> 00:18:25,698
starting with the business idea
and this very chaotic organization.

333
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:28,446
And then, as the organization grows,

334
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:33,416
things become more regimented 
and routine-based,

335
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,481
and people become more specialized.

336
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,757
That’s normal.

337
00:18:37,193 --> 00:18:39,612
Continuing on where we left off,

338
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:42,237
we’re talking about
this sort of progression

339
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:48,048
between the small startup company
and the large scaled up business.

340
00:18:48,048 --> 00:18:53,896
We want to contrast here
two different types of organization.

341
00:18:53,896 --> 00:18:57,074
The first one is what we call 
the <i>organic structure</i>,

342
00:18:57,074 --> 00:18:59,308
and the second one 
is more <i>hierarchical structure.</i>

343
00:18:59,308 --> 00:19:01,191
And so just to give you a little bit--

344
00:19:01,191 --> 00:19:04,455
you’re probably 
in the organic structure right now.

345
00:19:04,455 --> 00:19:06,465
That’s at the very early stages.

346
00:19:06,465 --> 00:19:09,843
When the founders dominate the venture,

347
00:19:09,843 --> 00:19:12,142
there’s a big, big focus 
on product development,

348
00:19:12,142 --> 00:19:13,517
market development.

349
00:19:14,139 --> 00:19:18,967
There’s not a lot of managerial tasks,
delegation, etc.

350
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:21,303
Since people try to do multiple tasks

351
00:19:21,303 --> 00:19:23,858
--just sort of the decathlete
that we talked about last time--

352
00:19:23,858 --> 00:19:28,120
and then we have a lot
of informal communication

353
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,084
which increases creativity 
and sort of network type control.

354
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:34,251
It’s not like sort of a boss
telling you what to do

355
00:19:34,251 --> 00:19:36,074
but more of everyone’s 
doing their own thing

356
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,042
and we all talk to each other 
and that’s the way

357
00:19:38,042 --> 00:19:41,500
and we are accountable to each other
somehow as a group.

358
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:45,380
And then, as the business 
matures, inevitably,

359
00:19:46,883 --> 00:19:51,077
it almost has to move toward 
a hierarchical structure.

360
00:19:51,077 --> 00:19:56,136
I’m not saying it’s impossible
to leave it this way,

361
00:19:56,136 --> 00:19:58,903
but it’s kind of hard to manage 
a company that’s growing rapidly

362
00:19:58,903 --> 00:20:01,512
once it gets to a certain size

363
00:20:01,512 --> 00:20:04,826
without delegation and some kind
of hierarchical structure.

364
00:20:04,826 --> 00:20:06,186
So what does that mean?

365
00:20:06,186 --> 00:20:10,425
It means we have specialists
focusing on product development,

366
00:20:10,425 --> 00:20:12,540
on production, on marketing, etc.,

367
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,755
and all the different functions 
of a company.

368
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,803
We have more formal processes.

369
00:20:16,803 --> 00:20:18,645
We tend to write things
down more and say,

370
00:20:18,645 --> 00:20:20,659
“What does 
the job description look like?”,

371
00:20:20,659 --> 00:20:23,511
and “How does your salary work?”,

372
00:20:23,511 --> 00:20:25,422
and your bonus system, etc.

373
00:20:26,443 --> 00:20:30,346
There’s a lot of continuous monitoring
and improvement

374
00:20:30,346 --> 00:20:32,148
of internal information flow.

375
00:20:32,148 --> 00:20:34,460
So instead of just having 
a chaotic information flow,

376
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:36,416
we try and structure the information flow

377
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:40,616
so that we can communicate
in a more efficient manner.

378
00:20:40,616 --> 00:20:42,464
And then there’s well-defined control.

379
00:20:42,464 --> 00:20:44,410
That basically means there’s more

380
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:50,685
of a supervisor-subordinate type
relationship where,

381
00:20:52,931 --> 00:20:55,102
“I’m the employee and you’re the boss”,

382
00:20:55,102 --> 00:21:00,191
and you basically, negotiate with me
about what task I should work on.

383
00:21:00,191 --> 00:21:03,271
Then I prove to you 
that I am actually doing the things

384
00:21:03,271 --> 00:21:05,709
that you’re controlling, in some sense.

385
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:07,629
So what you have here

386
00:21:07,629 --> 00:21:11,693
is the inevitable move 
toward a hierarchical structure.

387
00:21:11,693 --> 00:21:13,534
Now, of course, having 
a hieirarchical structure

388
00:21:13,534 --> 00:21:17,481
too early on in a venture
is also not good.

389
00:21:17,481 --> 00:21:22,026
It’s most people would consider
to be kind of an impediment to creativity.

390
00:21:22,026 --> 00:21:25,396
And on the other hand,
hanging on to an organic structure

391
00:21:25,396 --> 00:21:28,824
after the company’s gotten very, very big,
is also very problematic

392
00:21:28,824 --> 00:21:32,121
because then you start running 
into a lot of efficiency problems

393
00:21:32,121 --> 00:21:34,127
and it makes it hard to scale.

394
00:21:35,068 --> 00:21:38,184
So what kind of problems can you expect

395
00:21:38,184 --> 00:21:41,159
when you are in your growth phase?

396
00:21:41,665 --> 00:21:44,900
Typically, what that means
is you’re hiring people,

397
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,066
your market’s expanding, 
you get a lot more customers coming in.

398
00:21:48,066 --> 00:21:50,122
So basically, you’re scaling,
as we’ve discussed,

399
00:21:50,122 --> 00:21:53,451
and that sounded great, 
at the time, a few slides ago.

400
00:21:53,451 --> 00:21:57,096
But now, when you think about
the downsides of this,

401
00:21:57,096 --> 00:21:59,193
there’s a lot of things to watch out for here.

402
00:22:00,104 --> 00:22:04,271
The first is that your tools, 
your controlling tools,

403
00:22:04,271 --> 00:22:07,070
--which is usually word of mouth
and network controls,

404
00:22:07,070 --> 00:22:08,669
we’ve mentioned before--

405
00:22:08,669 --> 00:22:12,649
they’re insufficient to handle
a larger number of employees

406
00:22:12,649 --> 00:22:15,437
and a large number of tasks 
and specialists.

407
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:18,223
So the information flows 
become too complex

408
00:22:18,223 --> 00:22:21,327
because if everyone 
is communicating to everybody,

409
00:22:21,327 --> 00:22:23,233
and you have some specialists,

410
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,343
but no one is really 
clearly making decisions

411
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,534
because you’re in kind of a startup mode,

412
00:22:28,044 --> 00:22:32,597
the information flows
become too complex to actually use.

413
00:22:32,597 --> 00:22:36,766
Management becomes too overloaded.

414
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:42,104
And we say there’s running a business,
focusing an operative business.

415
00:22:42,104 --> 00:22:43,784
The span of supervision is too large.

416
00:22:43,784 --> 00:22:47,997
In other words, a span of control
is basically when one supervisor

417
00:22:47,997 --> 00:22:50,771
is in charge of multiple of employees.

418
00:22:50,771 --> 00:22:54,260
That’s the span, how many;
and if that becomes too big

419
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,807
--because there are too many things
going on at once--

420
00:22:56,807 --> 00:22:59,362
then it becomes very, 
very difficult to supervise.

421
00:23:00,482 --> 00:23:03,721
It can lead to a bottleneck 
when you’re making decisions.

422
00:23:03,721 --> 00:23:07,461
For example, if every single decision
has to go all the way up to the founder,

423
00:23:08,201 --> 00:23:10,518
and your company is growing rapidly,

424
00:23:10,518 --> 00:23:13,025
and there are lots of decisions 
coming in day to day,

425
00:23:13,471 --> 00:23:17,292
it can actually overwhelm the founder

426
00:23:17,292 --> 00:23:21,101
or the supervisor in some other cases.

427
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:23,966
That leads you to push away

428
00:23:23,966 --> 00:23:26,046
all the strategic thinking
that you need to do,

429
00:23:26,046 --> 00:23:27,852
and you’re just focusing on 
the day to day,

430
00:23:27,852 --> 00:23:31,141
and that becomes
very, very, very difficult to handle.

431
00:23:31,431 --> 00:23:34,730
So that leads
to the overwork of the team.

432
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:38,852
And whenever you have overwork,
overwork is good in the short term.

433
00:23:38,852 --> 00:23:41,300
Feeling you’re under 
a deadline pressure is nice,

434
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:46,170
but continuous burn out 
can lead to frustration,

435
00:23:46,170 --> 00:23:47,771
loss of motivation.

436
00:23:47,771 --> 00:23:51,245
And finally, the tasks

437
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:56,171
are originally defined by individuals
and their personality,

438
00:23:56,191 --> 00:23:59,232
“I’m good at this. I should do this,”
and not by the job description.

439
00:23:59,232 --> 00:24:04,616
Eventually, you need to somehow decide 
on the different jobs for the specialists.

440
00:24:04,616 --> 00:24:06,378
And in case there’s a fluctuation,

441
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:10,311
the original plan of having 
everyone do everything

442
00:24:10,311 --> 00:24:13,020
and basing your task on your personality,

443
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,581
becomes very, very difficult.

444
00:24:15,581 --> 00:24:19,385
Because you might need to shift 
what people are working on,

445
00:24:19,385 --> 00:24:23,196
and it’s better to, 
in the case of a growing company,

446
00:24:23,196 --> 00:24:24,772
to define the job description.

447
00:24:24,772 --> 00:24:26,783
So basically, 
what we’re talking about here

448
00:24:26,783 --> 00:24:30,189
is moving toward a more
managerial type company

449
00:24:30,189 --> 00:24:32,235
as opposed to a founder type company.

450
00:24:32,970 --> 00:24:35,597
Just getting back
to the stages of growth model,

451
00:24:35,597 --> 00:24:38,866
I think what you can see here is

452
00:24:38,866 --> 00:24:44,109
that this is sort of the optimal way

453
00:24:44,109 --> 00:24:46,684
of dealing with scale.

454
00:24:47,718 --> 00:24:51,949
And as I mentioned before, 
keeping this model

455
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:58,016
when your company is very, very large,

456
00:25:00,458 --> 00:25:04,019
is not a very, very efficient way
to run a company.

457
00:25:04,019 --> 00:25:07,621
And you really need 
to move in the direction

458
00:25:07,621 --> 00:25:11,290
of the more--
this is the founder part.

459
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:14,974
This is the founder-dominated
part of the graph.

460
00:25:18,865 --> 00:25:21,790
Up here is the more managerial part,

461
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:25,295
so you’re going to switch 
for a founder orientation

462
00:25:25,295 --> 00:25:27,989
to a managerial orientation.

463
00:25:27,989 --> 00:25:31,478
Again, keeping a large company

464
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:36,517
with a small company’s organization 
structure is not very useful.

465
00:25:36,517 --> 00:25:42,577
Likewise, having a large structure

466
00:25:43,762 --> 00:25:47,664
for a small, small company 
is also not efficient at all,

467
00:25:47,664 --> 00:25:49,542
and it’s too rigid.

468
00:25:49,542 --> 00:25:54,701
So basically, what we see here
is there’s inevitable bumps in the road.

469
00:25:55,176 --> 00:26:00,514
And so what you need 
to think about here is eventually,

470
00:26:00,514 --> 00:26:02,854
if you have this happy problem, 
you’re going to grow.

471
00:26:02,854 --> 00:26:05,382
You’re going to grow 
to a certain size overtime

472
00:26:05,418 --> 00:26:08,091
and that there are going to be bumps
on the road on the way

473
00:26:08,091 --> 00:26:13,854
that have to do with different aspects
of making a transition

474
00:26:13,854 --> 00:26:17,331
to a more structured organization.

475
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:22,011
You can read the Greiner,
we put a link to it on our site.

476
00:26:22,011 --> 00:26:23,751
You can read the Greiner book

477
00:26:23,751 --> 00:26:25,775
for all the different details
of the different crises.

478
00:26:25,775 --> 00:26:27,683
There are going to be 
certain crises overtime

479
00:26:27,683 --> 00:26:31,297
and they’re going to be 
reorganizations overtime but in the end,

480
00:26:31,297 --> 00:26:36,540
this is a much more efficient way
of organizing to handle a large company

481
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:38,681
that has a large volume of sales.

482
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:41,483
So that’s it for 5.4.

483
00:26:41,483 --> 00:26:46,982
What we’re going to do next is 
a little summary of this whole module,

484
00:26:46,982 --> 00:26:49,640
so stay with us.
