2
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:35,847
So, we’re on week five
of the course

3
00:00:35,847 --> 00:00:38,454
on value capture and growth.

4
00:00:38,454 --> 00:00:40,313
And this is actually the final week!

5
00:00:40,313 --> 00:00:42,770
So, congratulations
to making it so far.

6
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,668
It’s only a few more segments,
then you’re done with the whole MOOC.

7
00:00:45,668 --> 00:00:48,690
As we said, you’re going to focus
on the most essential elements,

8
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:51,521
and by now you’ve seen
that we actually focus only

9
00:00:51,521 --> 00:00:53,239
on the essential elements.

10
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,890
- Thanks for staying with us so far.
- Thanks for staying with us.

11
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,744
And, so far what we have covered is,

12
00:00:57,744 --> 00:00:59,613
in week 2, opportunity
identification.

13
00:00:59,613 --> 00:01:02,357
You know, the first baby steps
that you do as an entrepreneur:

14
00:01:02,357 --> 00:01:06,087
Identify an opportunity,
looking at how valuable it might be.

15
00:01:06,087 --> 00:01:08,025
The second point was,
in week 3,

16
00:01:08,025 --> 00:01:10,028
that we looked
at entrepreneurial marketing,

17
00:01:10,028 --> 00:01:12,313
which is, like,
getting the first sales,

18
00:01:12,313 --> 00:01:14,082
getting a healthy company,

19
00:01:14,082 --> 00:01:15,539
getting your company
off the ground.

20
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:17,297
And then week 4,
we talked about finance.

21
00:01:17,297 --> 00:01:19,978
Right; so with the raising
and managing money,

22
00:01:19,978 --> 00:01:22,992
we talked a lot about
the different types of investors.

23
00:01:22,992 --> 00:01:24,690
We talked about how much
money you'd need,

24
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,435
making financial projections,

25
00:01:26,435 --> 00:01:29,432
looking for cash,
keeping your cash management.

26
00:01:29,432 --> 00:01:32,514
And, how to set up
your crowdfunding.

27
00:01:32,514 --> 00:01:36,462
But—exactly, and you know,
all of this is nice,

28
00:01:36,462 --> 00:01:38,522
- but you need to capture also the value,
- Yeah.

29
00:01:38,522 --> 00:01:41,405
because if you do not capture the value
of what you’re creating,

30
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:43,142
well, someone else
is capturing the value.

31
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:45,951
So, in other words,
you’re working for someone else.

32
00:01:45,951 --> 00:01:48,438
So in this segment,
we’re going to talk about value capture,

33
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:50,741
which actually means, well,
there are some provisions,

34
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:52,653
some strategies you can apply

35
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:54,651
so that the value
actually accrues to you,

36
00:01:54,651 --> 00:01:55,673
and not to someone else.

37
00:01:55,673 --> 00:01:59,276
And that’s what you have deserved
because so far you have worked hard

38
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:00,596
on this MOOC.

39
00:02:00,596 --> 00:02:04,106
So one way of capturing value,

40
00:02:04,106 --> 00:02:06,546
or at least one of the beginning ways
of capturing value

41
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:09,231
is to protect your idea.

42
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:11,487
So in 5.1, what we’re going to do

43
00:02:11,487 --> 00:02:14,553
is think about intellectual property,

44
00:02:14,553 --> 00:02:17,191
how it works,
why do we have it,

45
00:02:17,191 --> 00:02:19,749
why do different countries
have different rules about it,

46
00:02:19,749 --> 00:02:21,417
and what does it mean?

47
00:02:21,417 --> 00:02:23,083
So how can you protect your idea

48
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,965
using different forms
of intellectual property?

49
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:26,854
Exactly. And you might
have different ideas,

50
00:02:26,854 --> 00:02:29,858
so not every idea
is right for a patent.

51
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,147
But there are other ways,
and we going to talk about that.

52
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:33,913
Right, we’ll go through all those.

53
00:02:33,913 --> 00:02:36,774
So copyrights are just one way
of protecting your idea,

54
00:02:36,774 --> 00:02:39,330
and trying to make sure
that you can capture the value inherent

55
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,066
in your technological innovation.

56
00:02:41,066 --> 00:02:43,414
There are others,
and in segment 5.2,

57
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:45,657
we talk about these other ways.

58
00:02:45,657 --> 00:02:48,391
It might be that you
have complex production processes

59
00:02:48,391 --> 00:02:50,207
that other people cannot observe,

60
00:02:50,207 --> 00:02:54,235
or complex product that
is not ready to be copied so easily

61
00:02:54,235 --> 00:02:56,643
by other actors,
by your competition.

62
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:58,199
And then there
are still other elements

63
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,691
that you might want to consider.

64
00:02:59,691 --> 00:03:02,990
Right, I mean, there’s also the issue
of controlling key assets.

65
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,038
You know, for example,

66
00:03:04,038 --> 00:03:07,135
if you need something
to commercialize your technology,

67
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:09,748
and you have it
in competitive supply.

68
00:03:09,748 --> 00:03:11,631
In other words,
you have a choice among people

69
00:03:11,631 --> 00:03:14,293
who can do that for you, then
of course you’re, generally speaking,

70
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:17,095
going to make more money
from your invention.

71
00:03:17,095 --> 00:03:19,289
Or it could be that
there’s only a small number

72
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:22,103
of companies that control
what you need to do to commercialize.

73
00:03:22,103 --> 00:03:25,322
Maybe you’re one of the key holders
of one of those assets.

74
00:03:25,322 --> 00:03:28,382
If you’re not, you’re probably going
to have to pay for it, that’s the point.

75
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:31,170
So there is some strategic analysis
that has to go into understanding,

76
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:34,634
well, how can you benefit the most
by cooperating with different types

77
00:03:34,634 --> 00:03:37,099
of people and firms out there.

78
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,978
And even if it doesn’t work out
for you in that sense,

79
00:03:39,978 --> 00:03:43,128
you can still make money
by moving on quickly.

80
00:03:43,128 --> 00:03:45,444
So we’re going to discuss all
of these different aspects

81
00:03:45,444 --> 00:03:46,989
during that segment.

82
00:03:46,989 --> 00:03:49,125
So in terms of value capture,
you shouldn’t only think

83
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,518
about your product
and the strategic assets, etc.

84
00:03:52,518 --> 00:03:55,345
You also should think about
the legal considerations more generally.

85
00:03:55,345 --> 00:03:59,872
So in 5.3, we talk about more broadly
about legal considerations,

86
00:03:59,872 --> 00:04:01,936
- such as—
- Product liability.

87
00:04:01,936 --> 00:04:07,512
For example, what do you do
if your product can injure people--

88
00:04:07,512 --> 00:04:08,517
Exactly.

89
00:04:08,517 --> 00:04:10,730
whether they’re using it correctly
or incorrectly?

90
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:13,222
Or the kinds of corporate structure
that you might want to have

91
00:04:13,222 --> 00:04:17,411
to limit your own personal liability,
so that you’re not sued

92
00:04:17,411 --> 00:04:19,887
if something happens
in the course of you doing business.

93
00:04:19,887 --> 00:04:23,802
So more generally, we’ll talk also
about engaging a lawyer,

94
00:04:23,802 --> 00:04:25,938
and what are the sort of issues
you need to talk about

95
00:04:25,938 --> 00:04:27,172
with your attorney.

96
00:04:27,172 --> 00:04:28,894
We understand that you,
as an entrepreneur,

97
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:31,184
you want to create things,
create something cool and new,

98
00:04:31,184 --> 00:04:33,624
- so this might not sound too exciting—
- Hahaha!

99
00:04:33,624 --> 00:04:35,096
but please listen to this segment

100
00:04:35,096 --> 00:04:38,067
because we’ve seen companies
fail on that front.

101
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,353
They did everything else right,
but on that front,

102
00:04:40,353 --> 00:04:42,236
on the legal front,
they lost out.

103
00:04:42,236 --> 00:04:44,702
So in that sense,
they were dying

104
00:04:44,702 --> 00:04:47,994
because they couldn’t
protect themselves legally.

105
00:04:47,994 --> 00:04:52,979
So the last segment in 5
is 5.4: Pivoting and Growth.

106
00:04:53,479 --> 00:04:58,087
Now in order to capture value,
you may need to change

107
00:04:58,087 --> 00:05:00,922
what you’re doing,
or you may need to grow bigger.

108
00:05:00,922 --> 00:05:03,130
So we’re going to talk a lot
about both of these things.

109
00:05:03,130 --> 00:05:04,776
First we’ll talk about pivoting.

110
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:08,134
In other words, modifying some aspect
of your business model

111
00:05:08,134 --> 00:05:10,204
to take advantage
of a new opportunity,

112
00:05:10,204 --> 00:05:11,683
or to shift what you’re doing,

113
00:05:11,683 --> 00:05:14,160
because what you’re doing so far
hasn't worked out perfectly.

114
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,665
And that actually links to what
we discussed in the second week

115
00:05:16,665 --> 00:05:17,995
when we talked
about opportunities

116
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:19,769
and the multiple opportunities
you might see,

117
00:05:19,769 --> 00:05:21,561
because that means
if you have a Plan B,

118
00:05:21,561 --> 00:05:24,958
another opportunity in place,
that’s a well-made ground,

119
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:27,191
a prepared ground
for pivoting your venture to.

120
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:30,525
Perfect! And then,
we will also talk about growth.

121
00:05:30,525 --> 00:05:34,118
We’ll talk about growth strategies
for getting you off the ground,

122
00:05:34,118 --> 00:05:36,689
and we’ll talk
about the very happy problems

123
00:05:36,689 --> 00:05:38,945
that you might have
when you get to be bigger,

124
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:41,112
because there you need
to make a kind of a shift

125
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:43,612
toward a more managerially
oriented company.

126
00:05:43,612 --> 00:05:46,331
- You might have to delegate your--
- Delegate more.

127
00:05:46,331 --> 00:05:48,076
You need to give up
a little bit of control.

128
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:50,500
And those are very nice things
that happen to you

129
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,966
when your company
is growing rapidly,

130
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:55,331
so we will discuss also
challenges of growth.

131
00:05:55,871 --> 00:06:00,384
So week 5 is really
about extracting the value

132
00:06:00,384 --> 00:06:01,908
from your innovations.

133
00:06:01,908 --> 00:06:04,507
So if you think about it,
it’s really like having the crown jewel

134
00:06:04,507 --> 00:06:07,071
- in place to pick it and say--
- Ta dah!

135
00:06:07,071 --> 00:06:09,834
“Hey! I’m not only
creating something new,

136
00:06:09,834 --> 00:06:11,569
"I’m already benefiting from it.

137
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:13,830
And create value for myself!”

138
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:17,160
Right; so, stay with us
for week 5.
