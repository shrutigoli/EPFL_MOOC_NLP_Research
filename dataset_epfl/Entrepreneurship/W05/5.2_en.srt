1
00:00:05,209 --> 00:00:06,718
OK, welcome back!

2
00:00:06,719 --> 00:00:12,241
This is segment 5.2 on <i>Capturing Value</i>.

3
00:00:12,242 --> 00:00:14,384
Now, what we've done so far in this module

4
00:00:14,385 --> 00:00:18,600
is we've talked a lot
about intellectual property protection.

5
00:00:18,601 --> 00:00:20,982
And here we're going to take it
one step further

6
00:00:20,983 --> 00:00:26,283
and talk about how companies
can make money from their inventions.

7
00:00:27,203 --> 00:00:28,904
Let's start with some definitions.

8
00:00:28,905 --> 00:00:31,593
First, what is innovation?

9
00:00:32,491 --> 00:00:35,956
Innovation is the use of new knowledge

10
00:00:35,957 --> 00:00:40,262
to provide new products,
services, or processes.

11
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:47,634
And it involves invention,
commercialization, and appropriation.

12
00:00:47,964 --> 00:00:49,400
Let's talk about those.

13
00:00:49,401 --> 00:00:51,221
If you look at this graphic:

14
00:00:51,222 --> 00:00:56,781
invention is usually thought of as being
the research and development,

15
00:00:56,782 --> 00:01:01,349
the first initial ideas
for a new product, process, or service.

16
00:01:02,256 --> 00:01:07,533
Commercialization is product development
and bringing the product to market.

17
00:01:08,459 --> 00:01:13,709
And, finally, appropriation,
or <i>appropriability</i>,

18
00:01:13,734 --> 00:01:19,994
is about getting money and capturing value
from the invention in the marketplace.

19
00:01:19,995 --> 00:01:24,652
We're going to focus a lot
on appropriation in this segment.

20
00:01:25,508 --> 00:01:30,416
Appropriation, or appropriability
is intimately bound up

21
00:01:30,417 --> 00:01:33,335
with the idea of <i>imitability</i>.

22
00:01:34,062 --> 00:01:38,579
Imitability is the ability of someone else

23
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,820
to copy the invention of the entrepreneur.

24
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:47,568
And it's related to appropriability
in the following way:

25
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:53,442
when it's easy to copy something,
therefore imitability is high;

26
00:01:53,443 --> 00:01:56,344
it's much more difficult for the inventor

27
00:01:56,345 --> 00:01:58,845
to make money in general
to capture value.

28
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:04,942
And when it is difficult to copy
that means imitability is low.

29
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:08,972
Then it is easier for the entrepreneur

30
00:02:08,973 --> 00:02:12,086
to capture value
from his or her invention.

31
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:16,389
Most people think
that imitability is driven primarily

32
00:02:16,390 --> 00:02:19,308
by intellectual property protection.

33
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:20,789
And that may be true.

34
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:24,519
However, there are many cases
where intellectual property protection

35
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,244
is not the key driver of imitability.

36
00:02:28,245 --> 00:02:32,500
For example, it could be difficult
to copy an invention

37
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:37,584
even if there's little or no IP protection
on that product or service.

38
00:02:37,607 --> 00:02:41,061
That can be done
through many different ways

39
00:02:41,062 --> 00:02:44,449
including complexity; where is not obvious

40
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,640
how the product is actually put together

41
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:51,930
or what's happening behind the product.

42
00:02:51,931 --> 00:02:54,640
It could be tacit knowledge,

43
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:58,242
where the entrepreneur
has specific knowledge

44
00:02:58,243 --> 00:03:03,523
that is difficult to codify and transmit
and can only be learned on the job.

45
00:03:04,534 --> 00:03:06,733
That could be also difficult to copy.

46
00:03:06,734 --> 00:03:10,784
And, finally, if there's a lot
of process innovations

47
00:03:10,785 --> 00:03:14,459
behind the production
of the product or service.

48
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:19,690
Process innovations are usually
very, very difficult to observe

49
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:23,080
and, therefore, difficult
to copy the end product.

50
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:26,109
OK, let's talk about
<i>complementary assets</i>.

51
00:03:27,724 --> 00:03:31,175
The first thing we want to know is:
what is a complementary asset?

52
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:35,676
A complementary asset is everything

53
00:03:35,677 --> 00:03:38,676
that's required
to commercialize an invention

54
00:03:38,677 --> 00:03:41,912
aside from the technology itself.

55
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:44,879
So what are examples
of complementary assets?

56
00:03:45,987 --> 00:03:49,654
You could imagine your sales
and distribution,

57
00:03:50,892 --> 00:03:54,898
your manufacturing of a product,
the marketing of a product,

58
00:03:55,758 --> 00:03:59,537
and everything else that you can do
to bring your product to market

59
00:03:59,538 --> 00:04:04,172
aside from developing
a project or a technology itself.

60
00:04:04,173 --> 00:04:06,288
Imagine that you are part
of a supply chain.

61
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:10,010
You may order raw materials
from some partner.

62
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:13,143
You may do some operations
on that to produce a product.

63
00:04:13,144 --> 00:04:16,195
You need someone to go off
and sell the product.

64
00:04:16,196 --> 00:04:22,047
And then you may need to distribute
the product to the people who bought it.

65
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:26,098
All of those points,
aside from the product itself,

66
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:29,869
you might need access
to some complementary asset.

67
00:04:31,248 --> 00:04:35,805
Now, the question is:
is the the same as a complementary good?

68
00:04:35,806 --> 00:04:38,749
And the answer is: no, this is not
the same as a complementary good.

69
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:42,382
A complementary good is like a shoe
and shoe lace, you know.

70
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:47,298
When the price of shoes goes up,
the demand for shoe laces drops.

71
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:50,280
The two products
are used simultaneously with each other

72
00:04:50,281 --> 00:04:52,221
and they're complements to each other.

73
00:04:52,222 --> 00:04:53,603
So that's a complementary good.

74
00:04:53,604 --> 00:04:56,138
What we're talking about here
is a complementary asset,

75
00:04:56,139 --> 00:05:00,121
which is access
to some source that you need

76
00:05:00,122 --> 00:05:03,121
to commercialize your invention.

77
00:05:03,122 --> 00:05:04,709
The question often arises:

78
00:05:05,442 --> 00:05:09,600
when do I need to think
about complementary assets?

79
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:12,059
And the way
that we usually think about this

80
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:17,156
is to treat each complementary asset
one at a time and to examine it and say,

81
00:05:17,157 --> 00:05:18,786
"Is it relevant to me?"

82
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:21,240
"Do I need to care about this
particular one?"

83
00:05:22,309 --> 00:05:25,231
And to do that, we're going to develop
a little framework

84
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:29,957
to think about whether you should care
about each complementary asset.

85
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:35,062
I'm proposing that the way to think about
whether a complementary asset

86
00:05:35,063 --> 00:05:40,505
is relevant to you is to think about it
along two different dimensions.

87
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:44,457
The first is: is the asset
important or not?

88
00:05:46,138 --> 00:05:50,818
The second one is: if it's important,
who controls the asset?

89
00:05:51,645 --> 00:05:55,904
Is it in competitive supply,
in other words freely available?

90
00:05:55,905 --> 00:06:00,423
Or is it tightly held
by only one or two parties?

91
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:06,001
So if you look at this graphic,
what you see are four quadrants

92
00:06:06,002 --> 00:06:08,960
that are based on the combinations
of these things.

93
00:06:08,961 --> 00:06:11,505
So the lower-right corner, for example,

94
00:06:11,506 --> 00:06:14,092
is you have an important
complementary asset,

95
00:06:14,093 --> 00:06:17,956
but the complementary asset itself
is freely available.

96
00:06:17,957 --> 00:06:21,193
Let's say you've developed a basic watch.

97
00:06:21,194 --> 00:06:24,808
It's nothing fancy and it builds
on standardized components

98
00:06:24,809 --> 00:06:26,453
that you'd find in other watches.

99
00:06:26,454 --> 00:06:30,704
Now, you may ask yourself
whether you should care

100
00:06:30,705 --> 00:06:33,376
about the manufacturing of that watch.

101
00:06:33,377 --> 00:06:37,794
Is manufacturing an important
complementary asset?

102
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:41,084
And I think the answer here is yes.

103
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:45,471
You need access to manufacturers
to be able to commercialize your watch.

104
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:51,256
However, I would also propose
that it is freely available.

105
00:06:51,257 --> 00:06:55,181
There are many manufacturers out there
who would love to have your business.

106
00:06:55,182 --> 00:06:56,800
And I think with a few phone calls

107
00:06:56,801 --> 00:07:00,588
you could already have several offers
on the table within a few hours.

108
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:04,294
So, therefore, we see that this is going
to be in the lower right quadrant

109
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:09,524
where the complementary asset is important
however it is in competitive supply,

110
00:07:09,525 --> 00:07:11,341
or freely available.

111
00:07:11,342 --> 00:07:17,298
Now, imagine instead of a basic watch
that you had invented a software program.

112
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,332
You may ask yourself whether manufacturing
is a key complementary asset

113
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,798
for your software product.

114
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:31,676
And here I think most people would say
that a manufacturing facility

115
00:07:31,677 --> 00:07:37,114
is probably not too important
for a software program.

116
00:07:37,115 --> 00:07:40,193
So we see ourselves here
in the lower-left corner

117
00:07:40,194 --> 00:07:43,209
which is the complementary asset itself

118
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,696
is unimportant even if it is
freely available in the market.

119
00:07:46,697 --> 00:07:49,444
Now let's consider a different case

120
00:07:49,445 --> 00:07:53,590
where you have developed
a software app for a phone.

121
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:57,262
And now you're wondering

122
00:07:57,263 --> 00:08:01,672
whether you should care
about the App Store,

123
00:08:01,673 --> 00:08:04,879
which is the distribution network
for your app.

124
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,342
I think here we could agree

125
00:08:07,343 --> 00:08:11,633
the App Store, or a similar store like it
like the Google Play store,

126
00:08:11,634 --> 00:08:15,290
would be critically important
for the distribution of your app.

127
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:18,146
And, therefore,
to commercialize your product,

128
00:08:18,147 --> 00:08:21,322
you're going to need access
to that App Store.

129
00:08:22,656 --> 00:08:29,564
But, unfortunately for you, the App Store
is held and controlled by one company.

130
00:08:29,565 --> 00:08:31,887
And if you're thinking about other phones,

131
00:08:31,888 --> 00:08:35,813
in general, the distribution
to these phones is held

132
00:08:35,813 --> 00:08:38,054
by a very small number of companies.

133
00:08:38,054 --> 00:08:41,097
So there we find ourselves
in the upper-right quadrant

134
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,758
which is where the complementary asset
is important and it's tightly held.

135
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:50,873
And that means the owner of the App Store,
in this particular case Apple,

136
00:08:50,874 --> 00:08:54,044
would be controlling a lot
of the negotiation

137
00:08:54,045 --> 00:09:00,003
and controlling the terms of the deal
of your revenue-sharing agreement.

138
00:09:01,355 --> 00:09:05,791
Furthermore, the controller
of the complementary asset can decide

139
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:09,473
whether or not to even accept you
into the App Store or not.

140
00:09:09,474 --> 00:09:14,489
Now, finally, let's say you've come up
with, instead of an app for a phone,

141
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:20,784
you've come up with a fancy new case
for a phone, something like this.

142
00:09:20,785 --> 00:09:25,447
Now, this particular case
could be made of a new material

143
00:09:25,448 --> 00:09:28,178
or have some other properties
that are desirable.

144
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:32,266
So there let's consider
the case for the phone,

145
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:37,967
and let's consider the App Store
as a distribution channel.

146
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:41,114
Now, in this particular case, I think
most people would agree

147
00:09:41,115 --> 00:09:46,141
that the App Store is not really
that important as a distribution channel.

148
00:09:46,142 --> 00:09:49,188
Even if it's tightly held by Apple,

149
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:52,856
it doesn't really affect
the distribution of phone cases.

150
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:55,259
That would be a completely different
distribution channel.

151
00:09:55,260 --> 00:10:00,030
And so the App Store here is unimportant
to you as the entrepreneur.

152
00:10:00,031 --> 00:10:04,131
So, as you can see, there are
only two categories of outcomes here.

153
00:10:04,132 --> 00:10:09,006
And only one of which
the entrepreneur really cares about.

154
00:10:09,007 --> 00:10:13,515
I've broken that into two colors here:
the red zone and the green zone.

155
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:18,080
The red zone is the case
where the complementary asset

156
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:22,715
is both tightly held and important
to the entrepreneur.

157
00:10:22,716 --> 00:10:25,578
And the other three cases,
we put that in the green zone

158
00:10:25,579 --> 00:10:28,177
because that's not very much
of an issue for the entrepreneur.

159
00:10:28,178 --> 00:10:34,146
Either the complementary asset
is unimportant, in which case we're done,

160
00:10:34,147 --> 00:10:36,095
or it's freely available,

161
00:10:36,096 --> 00:10:39,295
in which case it's in competitive supply
and we can negotiate

162
00:10:39,296 --> 00:10:42,295
with lots of suppliers
to give us a good offer.

163
00:10:42,296 --> 00:10:46,139
So we're tending to capture value
from our invention.

164
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:48,157
Moving along to the next graphic,

165
00:10:48,158 --> 00:10:53,121
what I've done is I've taken the red zone
and put that on the right-hand side.

166
00:10:53,122 --> 00:10:56,619
That's the zone
where the complementary asset

167
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:59,817
is both important and tightly held.

168
00:10:59,818 --> 00:11:03,523
And on the left-hand side
of this table is the green zone.

169
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:08,613
The green zone is where it's either
unimportant or it's freely available.

170
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:11,956
Those are equivalent in the eyes
of the entrepreneur.

171
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:14,483
And then, on the left-hand side,

172
00:11:14,484 --> 00:11:19,457
what we have is we go back
to the imitability table,

173
00:11:19,458 --> 00:11:23,627
and we can differentiate
between things that are difficult to copy,

174
00:11:23,628 --> 00:11:25,733
that's <i>low imitability</i>,

175
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:30,250
or things that are very easy
to copy, that's <i>high imitability</i>.

176
00:11:30,251 --> 00:11:33,843
And now what we're going
to look at here is

177
00:11:33,844 --> 00:11:39,054
who captures the value from the invention
in each of these quadrants?

178
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:40,600
And it's not the same.

179
00:11:41,933 --> 00:11:44,697
Let's look at the upper-left quadrant.

180
00:11:44,698 --> 00:11:51,208
The upper-left quadrant, here, is the case
where the complementary assets

181
00:11:51,209 --> 00:11:56,251
are unimportant or freely available,
and imitibility is low.

182
00:11:56,277 --> 00:11:58,227
So here's the case where the entrepreneur

183
00:11:58,228 --> 00:12:00,533
has a product or service
that's difficult to copy,

184
00:12:00,534 --> 00:12:05,345
and all the complementary assets
are either freely available

185
00:12:05,346 --> 00:12:06,971
or they're unimportant.

186
00:12:06,972 --> 00:12:08,834
In this particular case,

187
00:12:08,835 --> 00:12:14,188
the entrepreneur or the inventor is going
to capture value from the invention.

188
00:12:15,765 --> 00:12:18,482
The opposite case is
the lower-right quadrant.

189
00:12:18,483 --> 00:12:22,265
That's the case
where the complementary asset

190
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:29,679
is important and tightly held
and, unfortunately for the entrepreneur,

191
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,951
it's easy to copy the product or service.

192
00:12:32,952 --> 00:12:36,674
Now there, as you can see,
the complementary asset holder

193
00:12:36,675 --> 00:12:39,960
is going to be in a very strong
negotiating position.

194
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:40,900
Why?

195
00:12:40,901 --> 00:12:46,008
Because the complementary asset holder
can simply copy the invention

196
00:12:46,009 --> 00:12:48,730
and commercialize it itself.

197
00:12:48,731 --> 00:12:50,798
Let's look at the lower-left corner.

198
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:54,378
That's the case where it is easy
to copy the invention

199
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:56,807
and at the same time,

200
00:12:56,808 --> 00:13:01,830
either the complementary assets are
unimportant or they're freely available.

201
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:06,807
In this particular case, what
you'd expect to see is lots of entry.

202
00:13:06,808 --> 00:13:10,998
People will copy the invention as soon
as they see it, they'll commercialize it,

203
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:14,305
and there will be many products
in the market that are highly similar.

204
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:18,839
In this particular case, you'd expect
to have a price war which means

205
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:23,991
that none of the companies here
are going to benefit or capture value.

206
00:13:23,992 --> 00:13:28,567
And, instead, it will be the customers,
or the end-users, that will benefit

207
00:13:28,568 --> 00:13:30,763
by having a much lower price
in the market.

208
00:13:32,347 --> 00:13:35,526
And then, finally, let's look
at the upper-right quadrant.

209
00:13:35,527 --> 00:13:37,820
In the upper-right quadrant you have

210
00:13:37,821 --> 00:13:41,182
a tightly held, important
complementary asset,

211
00:13:41,183 --> 00:13:43,667
and you've also got a product

212
00:13:43,668 --> 00:13:46,625
from the entrepreneur
that is difficult to copy.

213
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:50,847
This puts us into a negotiating,
bargaining game situation

214
00:13:50,848 --> 00:13:55,185
where both parties have some power
and no one can dictate the terms.

215
00:13:56,286 --> 00:13:59,458
And in this particular case
you might ask yourself,

216
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,136
"Well, which party is really going
to capture the most value?"

217
00:14:02,137 --> 00:14:06,405
And it's difficult to state here,
but empirically speaking, most of the time

218
00:14:06,406 --> 00:14:09,905
it's also the complementary asset holder
and not the entrepreneur

219
00:14:09,906 --> 00:14:11,455
that captures the value,

220
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:14,535
usually because the entrepreneur
is smaller

221
00:14:14,536 --> 00:14:18,769
and wants access
to the network or to the asset

222
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,673
that the complementary asset holder has

223
00:14:20,674 --> 00:14:23,959
and, therefore, has slightly less
bargaining power

224
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:27,741
even if the complementary asset holder
can't copy the entrepreneur's product.

225
00:14:27,742 --> 00:14:32,106
So what we just said
I've summarized here in this graphic.

226
00:14:33,202 --> 00:14:39,783
And what you might want to know is:
If I can't capture value, am I doomed?

227
00:14:39,784 --> 00:14:41,486
Do I have a bad idea?

228
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:45,498
And there are several different answers
to this question.

229
00:14:47,001 --> 00:14:49,379
The first is, in terms
of the opportunity recognition,

230
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,855
if you recall from the prior modules:

231
00:14:51,856 --> 00:14:54,638
from the point of view
of opportunity identification

232
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,136
the entrepreneur has some choice
as to which quadrant

233
00:14:59,137 --> 00:15:01,394
he or she is going to end up in.

234
00:15:02,216 --> 00:15:08,415
For example, the entrepreneur
could choose a product or service

235
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,834
where complementary assets
are freely available.

236
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:15,268
Or it could be that they invented
a new distribution mechanism.

237
00:15:16,088 --> 00:15:19,875
If you think of the case of Dell computer
that went directly to sales

238
00:15:19,876 --> 00:15:25,011
over the phone and finally the internet,
that was an interesting innovation

239
00:15:25,012 --> 00:15:28,590
in the sense that it bypassed
the retail channel completely

240
00:15:28,591 --> 00:15:30,434
which was normal
in the hardware business.

241
00:15:30,435 --> 00:15:33,114
So it's not to say, "If you're in
the hardware business,

242
00:15:33,115 --> 00:15:37,870
you're doomed to go through a retailer
and retailers are powerful, etc."

243
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:41,065
You may be able to come up
with your own distribution channel

244
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:44,103
which then bypasses
the complementary asset that you need.

245
00:15:44,104 --> 00:15:48,814
So first of all, in terms
of opportunity assessment

246
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:52,214
and recognition, exploitation,

247
00:15:52,215 --> 00:15:56,136
the entrepreneur isn't fully constrained

248
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:58,297
by the different quadrants here.

249
00:15:58,298 --> 00:16:01,108
And second of all,
even if you are in a quadrant

250
00:16:01,109 --> 00:16:03,199
that is not very advantageous,

251
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,237
in other words anything
but the upper-left quadrant here,

252
00:16:06,238 --> 00:16:07,666
you're still not doomed.

253
00:16:07,667 --> 00:16:10,951
It's just that different strategies apply
to these different quadrants.

254
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:14,060
So for the upper-left quadrant,
that's very clear.

255
00:16:14,061 --> 00:16:17,912
You're very difficult to copy, you've got
strong intellectual property protection,

256
00:16:17,913 --> 00:16:20,832
or maybe you've got complexity
going in your favor,

257
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:25,133
and therefore, you can expect to release
the product to market, capture value,

258
00:16:25,134 --> 00:16:27,173
and recoup your investment

259
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:30,825
taking your time to come up with
your next product or service.

260
00:16:31,397 --> 00:16:36,660
However, in the other quadrants
you may be forced

261
00:16:36,667 --> 00:16:42,084
or it may be desirable to come up with
a quicker response into the market,

262
00:16:42,087 --> 00:16:46,907
especially the lower row here
where it's easy to copy.

263
00:16:46,908 --> 00:16:50,669
If it's easy to copy your invention,
then when you get it to market,

264
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:53,766
you will make money at first,
you will capture some value.

265
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:57,138
But in the long run, or the medium run,
you won't be able to capture much value

266
00:16:57,139 --> 00:17:00,377
because other people are going
to see you, copy you, and enter.

267
00:17:00,378 --> 00:17:03,228
Therefore, you need to come up with a plan

268
00:17:03,229 --> 00:17:06,417
to make a continuous stream
of new products

269
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:08,637
once the first one's in the market.

270
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:09,963
So this is more what you call

271
00:17:09,964 --> 00:17:12,963
the <i>Run strategy</i>
versus the <i>Block strategy</i>.

272
00:17:12,964 --> 00:17:16,313
The Block strategy is: you just release
the product to market,

273
00:17:16,314 --> 00:17:19,029
you capture value
because it's difficult to copy,

274
00:17:20,239 --> 00:17:25,227
and you can, more or less,
milk your products, as we say.

275
00:17:25,228 --> 00:17:30,064
On the other hand, the Run strategy
is where you release the product to market

276
00:17:30,065 --> 00:17:34,363
and then you continue to commercialize
new products in a continuous stream

277
00:17:34,364 --> 00:17:37,344
that enables you to make money
for short periods of time

278
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:39,378
before you move on to the next thing.

279
00:17:40,513 --> 00:17:46,280
Now, one final note here about alliances
and the role of alliances.

280
00:17:46,281 --> 00:17:48,760
I often hear from entrepreneurs, they say,

281
00:17:48,761 --> 00:17:51,461
"Oh, I've got a great business.
It's built on alliances.

282
00:17:51,462 --> 00:17:53,406
Alliances are so great."

283
00:17:53,407 --> 00:17:56,701
I think if you look
at this framework here,

284
00:17:56,702 --> 00:18:00,970
you can understand why alliances
may or may not be so great, right?

285
00:18:00,971 --> 00:18:04,602
If your alliance is
with your complementary asset holder,

286
00:18:05,932 --> 00:18:08,072
and it's tightly held and important,

287
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:11,972
then the complementary asset holder,
in other words your alliance partner,

288
00:18:11,973 --> 00:18:17,992
is going to charge you a lot
to gain access to that asset.

289
00:18:19,201 --> 00:18:22,552
Therefore, it's not
necessarily a guarantee

290
00:18:22,553 --> 00:18:26,488
that having a bunch of alliance partners

291
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:29,654
is going to be either very profitable
or a very good idea.

292
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,750
If the alliance partner is going
to dictate the terms,

293
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:37,448
then it could end up being
a very expensive proposition.

294
00:18:38,718 --> 00:18:43,258
So, to summarize what we've covered today
in this segment on capturing value:

295
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:47,817
we started by discussing appropriability,

296
00:18:47,818 --> 00:18:50,931
or the ability for the entrepreneur
to capture value.

297
00:18:52,395 --> 00:18:56,214
We then moved on
to a discussion of imitaility,

298
00:18:56,215 --> 00:19:01,572
or how difficult or easy is it to copy
the entrepreneur's invention.

299
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:06,766
Then we talked about complementary assets

300
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:11,205
and we drew a distinction between
the cases where the complementary asset

301
00:19:11,206 --> 00:19:16,917
was important and tightly held
versus freely available or unimportant.

302
00:19:18,951 --> 00:19:20,278
Then we looked

303
00:19:20,279 --> 00:19:22,611
at these different combinations
of these factors

304
00:19:22,612 --> 00:19:27,765
to determine that one of the nicest places
for the entrepreneur to be

305
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:29,841
is the case where it's difficult to copy

306
00:19:29,842 --> 00:19:34,481
and complementary assets are
either freely available or unimportant.

307
00:19:34,482 --> 00:19:37,849
And probably
the most difficult place to be

308
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:44,018
is the case where it is easy to copy
and the complementary asset holder

309
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:49,234
is tightly holding on to access
to an important complementary asset.

310
00:19:50,879 --> 00:19:53,297
And there are different strategies

311
00:19:53,298 --> 00:19:56,297
for dealing with the situation
that you're in;

312
00:19:56,298 --> 00:19:59,261
how quickly you should commercialize
and release new products.

313
00:19:59,262 --> 00:20:03,415
And we also talked
about the opportunity assessment

314
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:08,118
and exploitation plan that might lead you
to one quadrant or another

315
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:12,434
so that you can have
a more successful venture

316
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:14,454
that captures a lot of value.

317
00:20:14,455 --> 00:20:16,483
Thanks a lot, we'll see you next time.
