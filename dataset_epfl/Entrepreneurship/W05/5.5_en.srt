00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:07,143
Welcome back to the MOOC studio.

2
00:00:07,143 --> 00:00:10,606
We're going to go over the summary 
of week five.

3
00:00:10,606 --> 00:00:13,556
"Profiting From Your Innovation Now."

4
00:00:13,871 --> 00:00:19,045
As you recall this past week, we've
talked about protecting your idea.

5
00:00:19,425 --> 00:00:23,686
Furthermore, we talked about how 
do you make money relative

6
00:00:23,686 --> 00:00:26,682
to some of your ecosystem partners.

7
00:00:27,011 --> 00:00:29,165
Then we discussed legal aspects,

8
00:00:29,264 --> 00:00:33,840
And then finally, we talked a lot
about scalability and growth.

9
00:00:34,174 --> 00:00:37,871
So let's get right to it and go 
through some of the key highlights

10
00:00:37,871 --> 00:00:39,711
of this past week.

11
00:00:41,842 --> 00:00:43,633
Alright, so we began the week

12
00:00:43,633 --> 00:00:50,701
with a discussion about intellectual
property and protecting your ideas.

13
00:00:51,488 --> 00:00:54,409
We discussed the distinction 
between intellectual property

14
00:00:54,409 --> 00:00:55,899
and real property.

15
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,204
We talked a little about the motivation:

16
00:00:58,204 --> 00:01:03,148
Why do nations try and promote 
intellectual property

17
00:01:03,148 --> 00:01:06,023
and what are some of the advantages 
and disadvantages of it?

18
00:01:06,023 --> 00:01:10,345
And then we walked through the four 
main types of intellectual property

19
00:01:10,345 --> 00:01:12,948
that you will probably need 
to deal with in the early stages

20
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:14,620
of your company's development.

21
00:01:14,620 --> 00:01:17,272
So, we started with trade secrets,

22
00:01:17,272 --> 00:01:20,432
which is the most common form, 
which is basically just keeping

23
00:01:20,432 --> 00:01:23,743
something secret and telling 
everyone that it's a secret.

24
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,868
Then we talked about trademarks,
which is a symbol that represents

25
00:01:27,868 --> 00:01:30,158
your company and how they work.

26
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:33,415
And then we moved on to patents

27
00:01:33,415 --> 00:01:39,463
which represent some kind 
of, typically, tangible item

28
00:01:39,667 --> 00:01:44,741
but could also represent a process,
or even in some cases a method.

29
00:01:44,964 --> 00:01:51,349
And what are some of the advantages
and disadvantages of holding a patent?

30
00:01:51,754 --> 00:01:57,120
And then finally, we discussed briefly,
copyrights which refer to creative output

31
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:02,657
and we discussed how those work, 
and what are some

32
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:04,821
of the advantages
and disadvantages of those.

33
00:02:04,821 --> 00:02:10,227
So, think of these, remember that
these are one piece

34
00:02:10,227 --> 00:02:12,825
in your arsenal of making money.

35
00:02:13,103 --> 00:02:19,196
Because, as you recall, the first step 
is to prevent others from copying you.

36
00:02:20,459 --> 00:02:24,887
We then moved on in the second segment
to talk about complementary assets.

37
00:02:25,162 --> 00:02:27,695
Which is everything required 
to commercialize

38
00:02:27,695 --> 00:02:31,416
a technological innovation 
besides technology itself.

39
00:02:32,295 --> 00:02:37,638
So we discussed some examples 
of it, and we also developed

40
00:02:37,638 --> 00:02:42,554
a little framework about whether we 
should care about complementary assets.

41
00:02:42,554 --> 00:02:45,254
Or which ones we should 
care about and whether it's going

42
00:02:45,254 --> 00:02:49,663
to prevent us from making money 
or enable us to make money,

43
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:52,456
and we ended up
with this framework here.

44
00:02:52,456 --> 00:02:55,257
Where, if we have here
on the left-hand side,

45
00:02:55,257 --> 00:03:00,285
we have imitability, which is
referring to the ability

46
00:03:00,285 --> 00:03:06,256
of some competitor--or anybody-- 
to copy your product or service

47
00:03:07,222 --> 00:03:13,742
ranging from low to high and then, 
along the bottom we talk a little bit

48
00:03:13,742 --> 00:03:15,818
about the complementary assets
themselves.

49
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:19,398
Are they unimportant or freely available?

50
00:03:19,528 --> 00:03:22,111
In other words, you don't care about them

51
00:03:22,111 --> 00:03:26,611
or you can easily write a contract 
to have access to them.

52
00:03:26,768 --> 00:03:35,294
Or, whether they are important 
and tightly held, which means that only

53
00:03:35,294 --> 00:03:40,271
one or a very small number of companies
hold the complementary assets.

54
00:03:41,316 --> 00:03:48,127
And in which case you, as the inventor,
will certainly be in the driver's seat,

55
00:03:48,127 --> 00:03:54,107
as we say, in this quadrant where it's
difficult to imitate what you're doing

56
00:03:54,107 --> 00:03:56,877
and the complementary assets 
are unimportant or freely available.

57
00:03:56,953 --> 00:03:58,089
That's here.

58
00:03:59,259 --> 00:04:02,575
There's also a chance 
that you can gain something

59
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:06,124
in situations of low imitability.

60
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:10,610
Even if there's a tightly held asset.

61
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:16,933
And, chances are, you're not going 
to make much money

62
00:04:16,933 --> 00:04:24,428
off of this invention if, indeed,
it is easy to copy your invention.

63
00:04:24,515 --> 00:04:27,570
So here the complementary asset
holder will make the money,

64
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,579
and here customers will win.

65
00:04:29,953 --> 00:04:33,212
Not to say that these
are all bad places to be

66
00:04:33,212 --> 00:04:37,817
because it's just a question of how 
quickly you move on to the next product.

67
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:46,556
So, up here -the top half- you may 
be able to invent something

68
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:49,244
and then make money from it 
for a longer period of time.

69
00:04:49,682 --> 00:04:52,674
The lower half of this figure, you 
probably want to move

70
00:04:52,674 --> 00:04:57,440
on relatively quickly from your 
invention to the next invention

71
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,427
to come up with 
a new product frequently.

72
00:04:59,593 --> 00:05:02,381
So you're running: keep a Run strategy.

73
00:05:02,823 --> 00:05:08,705
We then moved on to discuss legal issues
including: What is liability?

74
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:13,182
It's when you are held 
responsible for something.

75
00:05:14,162 --> 00:05:19,721
We talked about incorporation:
what kinds of shares do you need to have,

76
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:22,808
why managers and founders 
should always vest their shares,

77
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:25,386
what happens if someone 
leaves your company?

78
00:05:25,656 --> 00:05:28,993
We talked about intellectual property 
filings outside of your country.

79
00:05:28,993 --> 00:05:31,837
So what is your overall 
global technology strategy?

80
00:05:32,273 --> 00:05:37,450
We discussed non-compete 
contracts, product liability,

81
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:42,201
and even what to look 
for in finding a lawyer.

82
00:05:42,954 --> 00:05:47,458
And then in this very last segment, 
we talked a little bit about pivoting.

83
00:05:48,509 --> 00:05:52,528
What it is and when 
you would want to do it.

84
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:57,931
And here, this should be, when 
your primary assumptions are wrong.

85
00:05:57,957 --> 00:06:01,529
When people have a hard time 
paying when you expected them to pay,

86
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:05,930
when things change in your environment,
when your sales cycle are too long,

87
00:06:06,052 --> 00:06:11,488
that's a sign that you should be shifting
some aspects of your business model

88
00:06:11,488 --> 00:06:15,518
to take advantage of the needs
that are actually out there.

89
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:21,518
We discussed scaling up, and that means
achieving higher sales volume,

90
00:06:21,518 --> 00:06:23,777
using the same infrastructure.

91
00:06:23,937 --> 00:06:27,541
And we talked a little bit about
what to do to make that happen.

92
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:28,944
So, you create the backend.

93
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:32,150
You want to make sure 
that your marginal costs

94
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:34,937
of adding more sales is low.

95
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:39,876
And we also want to make sure that
the organization itself can handle growth.

96
00:06:40,836 --> 00:06:46,557
Which led us to this final figure here,
where we discussed the relation

97
00:06:46,557 --> 00:06:50,601
between the size of an organization
and the age of an organization

98
00:06:50,601 --> 00:06:53,404
and the different stages 
that the organization

99
00:06:53,404 --> 00:06:58,875
usually passes through when it grows
into a larger entity.

100
00:06:58,875 --> 00:07:04,859
If you recall from this figure, 
and from our discussion, the organization

101
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:10,282
– the start up company –moves 
from the founder driven organization

102
00:07:10,282 --> 00:07:15,252
in the beginning, accompanied by multiple
crises at various points in time,

103
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:21,120
to a more managerial oriented
hierarchal company,

104
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,811
that is much bigger 
and has a much higher scale.

105
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:27,820
So that's it for week five content.

106
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,820
Stay tuned for the summary

107
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:34,259
of the whole course that Marc 
and I are going to do next.
