1
00:00:05,397 --> 00:00:07,460
Welcome back to 5.3.

2
00:00:08,252 --> 00:00:13,389
Today we're going to discuss
legal aspects of entrepreneurship

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,269
and just to give you a quick overview

4
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:20,701
of kind of top level issues
that you should be thinking about

5
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:23,056
right now, while you are considering
starting a company,

6
00:00:24,567 --> 00:00:26,193
and my disclaimer, again, is

7
00:00:26,194 --> 00:00:29,130
this should not be construed
as legal advice! (laughs)

8
00:00:29,322 --> 00:00:31,739
So I can't give you any legal advice,

9
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,709
I'm just throwing some information
out at you here

10
00:00:33,709 --> 00:00:35,020
that you might find interesting,

11
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:39,439
and you should definitely talk to a lawyer
if you have any of these issues.

12
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,105
We are going to discuss what is <i>liability</i>,

13
00:00:42,548 --> 00:00:44,944
we'll talk a bit about <i>incorporation</i>,

14
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:48,086
<i>vesting shares</i>, what does it mean.

15
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:51,414
We'll talk about
<i>intellectual property filings</i>

16
00:00:51,414 --> 00:00:53,102
outside of your country,

17
00:00:54,325 --> 00:00:57,638
what is a <i>non-compete</i>
clause or contract,

18
00:00:58,571 --> 00:01:01,302
how do you deal
with <i>product liability</i>, what is it,

19
00:01:01,676 --> 00:01:04,190
then, we'll also give you some suggestions

20
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,432
on how to find a lawyer.

21
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:10,933
So let's move right along
right now, with <i>liability</i>.

22
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:13,179
What is liability?

23
00:01:13,838 --> 00:01:18,049
Liability is when you are held responsible

24
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,450
for something that you did.

25
00:01:20,882 --> 00:01:26,023
It sounds bad usually,
because it is bad.

26
00:01:26,023 --> 00:01:29,092
There's usually something bad
happening and therefore,

27
00:01:29,092 --> 00:01:32,259
people are trying to, as we say,
"search for the guilty",

28
00:01:32,704 --> 00:01:36,695
try to find the person who is responsible
from a legal point of view.

29
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:39,312
So, liability is
when you are held responsible

30
00:01:39,312 --> 00:01:41,065
for something bad that's happened.

31
00:01:42,628 --> 00:01:44,124
As an entrepreneur,

32
00:01:44,125 --> 00:01:46,651
there are many reasons
why you might be held responsible;

33
00:01:46,651 --> 00:01:50,022
we're going to try to talk about
some of these major ones today.

34
00:01:51,602 --> 00:01:53,268
In the course of running your business

35
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:54,957
you may have made
a bad business decision

36
00:01:54,957 --> 00:01:57,938
which injured somebody,
monetarily or otherwise.

37
00:01:58,798 --> 00:02:02,472
It could be that you are acting
in a fraudulent fashion;

38
00:02:02,472 --> 00:02:05,035
that you're hiding information,
or you are lying, etc.

39
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:10,557
Negligence, which is when you are
neglecting something

40
00:02:10,557 --> 00:02:14,927
that you know to be wrong or harmful.

41
00:02:15,671 --> 00:02:18,891
There could also be employment
or HR problems

42
00:02:18,891 --> 00:02:21,964
in which you are held liable,
and it could be, finally,

43
00:02:21,964 --> 00:02:24,767
that your products
cause damage to somebody,

44
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,823
--could be physical damage
or could be monetary damage--

45
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:33,673
and you might be considered
liable for those as well.

46
00:02:33,673 --> 00:02:37,297
So let's walk through this bad list here,

47
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:43,762
and try and understand the issues
for each of these things.

48
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,330
We already touched
on incorporation in Module 4,

49
00:02:49,562 --> 00:02:53,698
but I wanted to give
a little more detail this time around.

50
00:02:53,953 --> 00:02:55,877
When you talk about liability,

51
00:02:55,994 --> 00:02:58,780
you have your own personal liability.

52
00:02:59,394 --> 00:03:03,798
And then, depending
on how you incorporated your company,

53
00:03:04,507 --> 00:03:06,623
you may have liability
for the whole company.

54
00:03:07,295 --> 00:03:09,417
So it depends on the country,

55
00:03:10,406 --> 00:03:13,509
but most countries do make a distinction

56
00:03:14,013 --> 00:03:17,350
between something
that has unlimited liability

57
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:21,845
and other forms that have
limited liability.

58
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:26,295
So, usually, when you are
the only owner of the company

59
00:03:26,624 --> 00:03:29,036
--we'll call that <i>sole proprietorship</i>--

60
00:03:29,419 --> 00:03:31,865
and that is an extension of you;

61
00:03:31,865 --> 00:03:34,235
you are basically
making money on the side,

62
00:03:34,429 --> 00:03:37,733
and you have your own little operation.

63
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:43,367
And there you, unfortunately,
have unlimited liability.

64
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:46,256
So, when something happens to that company

65
00:03:46,256 --> 00:03:48,144
something goes wrong with that company,

66
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,134
then you may be on the hook

67
00:03:50,273 --> 00:03:52,643
to cover any damages
that you've caused,

68
00:03:52,643 --> 00:03:55,522
any monetary damages
or physical damages,

69
00:03:55,522 --> 00:03:57,619
based on your own assets.

70
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:03,714
Usually, sole proprietorships
are done at the very beginning,

71
00:04:03,714 --> 00:04:06,294
or for very low impact-type businesses.

72
00:04:06,294 --> 00:04:08,459
You have your own consulting company,

73
00:04:09,119 --> 00:04:11,329
you don't have very many clients,

74
00:04:11,902 --> 00:04:14,838
but it's fine, you do your own thing

75
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,561
and it's very unlikely
that you are going to injure somebody

76
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:21,565
and therefore, you are not that worried
about your assets.

77
00:04:22,353 --> 00:04:25,390
A partnership is similar, in many cases;

78
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:27,919
now different countries have
different rules about partnerships,

79
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,308
but the most basic form of partnership is

80
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:33,453
that you go into business with a partner,

81
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:36,587
and depending on
the kind of partnership it is,

82
00:04:36,587 --> 00:04:37,840
and the country,

83
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,313
but in many cases,

84
00:04:39,313 --> 00:04:44,236
both partners are liable for everything
that happens with that business.

85
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,405
Or if there are multiple partners,
they are all liable,

86
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:49,361
and there are
certain kinds of partnerships

87
00:04:49,361 --> 00:04:55,624
where some partners are not liable,
passive partners, limited partners, etc.

88
00:04:56,963 --> 00:05:02,839
But in general, when partners are
coming together in a partnership

89
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:07,851
and they are in fact jointly liable

90
00:05:07,851 --> 00:05:09,971
for anything happening with that company.

91
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:11,467
So partnership, in general,

92
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:14,177
does not protect you
from liability problems.

93
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,849
Then you have different kinds
of what people call

94
00:05:17,849 --> 00:05:19,661
limited liability companies,

95
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:22,929
and those limited liability companies have
different names in different countries,

96
00:05:22,929 --> 00:05:25,104
but the basic principle is

97
00:05:25,104 --> 00:05:29,002
that you either have
a private corporation,

98
00:05:29,002 --> 00:05:31,605
which means you have
a very limited number of shareholders

99
00:05:31,605 --> 00:05:34,800
--we talked about that a little bit,
when we talked about crowdfunding--

100
00:05:36,257 --> 00:05:39,339
or you have a public corporation,

101
00:05:39,734 --> 00:05:44,044
which is when you have
many, many shareholders,

102
00:05:44,044 --> 00:05:47,899
and when you make
some statements and disclosures

103
00:05:47,899 --> 00:05:49,819
about how your company is run,

104
00:05:49,948 --> 00:05:53,129
and you have it open
to the general public

105
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,994
to buy shares in that company.

106
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:57,993
What do these forms have to do
with each other?

107
00:05:57,993 --> 00:06:02,665
They trade off ease and low cost
against protection from liability.

108
00:06:02,665 --> 00:06:08,526
So, sole proprietorship is very easy,
you can do it immediately pretty much,

109
00:06:08,526 --> 00:06:09,836
in most countries.

110
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,890
On the other hand, it does not
protect you at all from liability.

111
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:17,388
Then, the more you move
toward a limited liability company,

112
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:20,620
then, it's difficult,
because you have to go

113
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:23,027
through lots of steps
to register the company, etc.,

114
00:06:23,027 --> 00:06:24,389
but on the other hand,

115
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,982
that does protect you
from the liability point of view.

116
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:28,693
So, it's something to think about,

117
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:30,878
how you want to plan that progression

118
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:36,585
as you move toward producing
and commercializing your product.

119
00:06:39,992 --> 00:06:44,614
It does not protect you;
none of these legal forms protect you

120
00:06:44,614 --> 00:06:46,801
from fraud and negligence.

121
00:06:47,732 --> 00:06:51,717
Not that you are planning
on being fraudulent or negligent.

122
00:06:52,234 --> 00:06:54,441
We'll talk about this one
in few minutes,

123
00:06:54,441 --> 00:06:56,414
but if you know about something
that's happening,

124
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:57,814
then you should react quickly.

125
00:06:57,814 --> 00:07:01,466
You should not try to cover things up,
or hide problems, etc,

126
00:07:01,466 --> 00:07:05,048
especially problems that can cause
damage to your customers, etc.

127
00:07:05,768 --> 00:07:08,788
In such cases in most countries

128
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:11,757
you can be found liable

129
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,628
for problems that were caused
by your fraudulent activities

130
00:07:16,146 --> 00:07:19,934
even if you have some kind
of limited liability company.

131
00:07:19,934 --> 00:07:26,513
So, be careful here,
and what this <i>does</i> protect you for

132
00:07:26,514 --> 00:07:28,661
is bad business decisions.

133
00:07:28,662 --> 00:07:31,166
In general, in most countries,

134
00:07:31,323 --> 00:07:32,835
you cannot be held liable

135
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:34,733
because you've made
a bad business decision.

136
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:37,351
OK, let's talk about
employment issues now.

137
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:42,203
Employment issues are dealing

138
00:07:42,203 --> 00:07:43,862
with the agreements that you make

139
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:47,337
with your co-founders
and with your employees.

140
00:07:48,023 --> 00:07:50,840
So, what I'm recommending here

141
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:53,751
is that, in the very early stages,

142
00:07:53,751 --> 00:07:56,843
I mean, once you think
you might start a company

143
00:07:57,032 --> 00:07:59,988
and that you might want to work
together with some people,

144
00:08:00,335 --> 00:08:03,445
you should draw up
a kind of a preliminary agreement.

145
00:08:04,341 --> 00:08:08,899
You should involve everybody
who's involved with the business idea

146
00:08:08,899 --> 00:08:10,362
at the beginning,

147
00:08:10,981 --> 00:08:12,612
and you should figure out a way

148
00:08:12,701 --> 00:08:17,295
to compensate them or to reward them,

149
00:08:17,549 --> 00:08:19,245
and they should accept it,

150
00:08:19,526 --> 00:08:21,389
to prevent disagreements later.

151
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:23,550
So you kind of laying up
the story of the company,

152
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:25,948
who is participating, who contributed,

153
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:27,770
and what are they going to get from it.

154
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:29,576
What does this avoid?

155
00:08:29,576 --> 00:08:32,510
This avoids missing founders
type of situations,

156
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:34,533
where somebody contributed
at the beginning,

157
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:36,404
then they disappeared,

158
00:08:36,404 --> 00:08:38,532
and then, if the company
is very successful,

159
00:08:38,532 --> 00:08:40,636
they reappear and say, "I am the one

160
00:08:40,636 --> 00:08:42,101
who thought about all these ideas,

161
00:08:42,101 --> 00:08:44,142
it was my idea in the first place,

162
00:08:44,142 --> 00:08:46,152
I want you to pay me...", etc., etc.

163
00:08:46,152 --> 00:08:49,207
So there you've got problems
with people showing up

164
00:08:49,207 --> 00:08:51,056
after your company is already successful.

165
00:08:51,953 --> 00:08:55,922
These kinds of agreements early on

166
00:08:55,923 --> 00:08:57,999
are also better for tax planning

167
00:08:57,999 --> 00:09:00,749
in case, at some point,
this thing takes off

168
00:09:00,749 --> 00:09:03,794
then you will have thought through

169
00:09:03,794 --> 00:09:05,621
perhaps some of the tax issues,

170
00:09:05,621 --> 00:09:07,225
because there are tax implications

171
00:09:07,225 --> 00:09:12,187
of when you can count as income
certain compensations that you received.

172
00:09:14,122 --> 00:09:16,018
Let's talk about vesting for a minute.

173
00:09:16,846 --> 00:09:19,255
Founder shares, and early employees too,

174
00:09:19,693 --> 00:09:22,635
they should always vest over time.

175
00:09:22,655 --> 00:09:25,718
So what you don't want to do
is make an agreement at the beginning

176
00:09:26,587 --> 00:09:28,314
where everyone owns a lot,

177
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:33,464
and then, one of the people leave
and this person leaves,

178
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:37,422
and then they've got all these shares
that you gave them at the beginning.

179
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:40,472
Should be a reward
for staying in the company

180
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:43,089
is that you should get
more and more shares.

181
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:46,215
What usually happens
is there's some shares

182
00:09:46,215 --> 00:09:48,026
allocated to the different founders,

183
00:09:48,530 --> 00:09:54,139
and then, those shares do not take effect
until certain milestones have passed,

184
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:58,076
either business milestones,
or time milestones,

185
00:09:58,076 --> 00:10:01,351
so that it rewards people
who stay longer and do more work.

186
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:04,252
They end up having more ownership
and control of the company.

187
00:10:04,252 --> 00:10:06,798
And all of these apply
to early employees as well,

188
00:10:06,798 --> 00:10:10,073
so you want to spell out
what they are doing,

189
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:12,282
spell out their compensation,

190
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:16,433
whether it be for money
or for shares, equity of the company,

191
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:20,792
and then, all early employees
should also have shares that vest

192
00:10:20,792 --> 00:10:24,178
so that makes them feel
committed to the company,

193
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:26,950
and they are actually rewarded
for the amount of the time

194
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:29,508
that they spend in the company.

195
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:31,377
Speaking of employment issues,

196
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:35,615
let's also discuss non-compete clauses
or non-compete contracts.

197
00:10:37,230 --> 00:10:38,772
They are very tricky.

198
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:43,072
It's something that you need
to think about for yourself

199
00:10:43,072 --> 00:10:44,820
--we'll talk about that in a minute--

200
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,885
and for your co-founders
and for your employees.

201
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:50,225
What is a non-compete clause?

202
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:53,432
A non-compete clause
is a kind of a contract

203
00:10:53,432 --> 00:10:57,525
that's drawn up between
an employer and an employee,

204
00:10:57,968 --> 00:11:02,502
and it prevents the employee
from competing with the employer

205
00:11:02,502 --> 00:11:03,878
in the future.

206
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,468
So I might sign a contract,
I might go to a company,

207
00:11:06,468 --> 00:11:08,264
I want a job and they say, "Fine,"

208
00:11:08,264 --> 00:11:09,954
or "Sign here."

209
00:11:09,954 --> 00:11:14,301
And it says, "you cannot compete
in this industry again,

210
00:11:14,301 --> 00:11:17,921
and you have to work for me forever,
(laughing)

211
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:21,719
and if you leave, you can't do anything,

212
00:11:21,719 --> 00:11:23,514
for any amount of time in the future,

213
00:11:23,514 --> 00:11:25,273
that has anything to do
with this business.

214
00:11:25,273 --> 00:11:29,048
That's a very broad definition.

215
00:11:29,244 --> 00:11:33,209
It can also say, you are not allowed
to contact any of our current customers,

216
00:11:33,209 --> 00:11:37,662
and you are not allowed to hire
away any of our current employees.

217
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:41,925
That's a very broad non-compete contract.

218
00:11:43,039 --> 00:11:46,026
Most countries don't allow such...

219
00:11:46,026 --> 00:11:48,127
that's called, in general, slavery,

220
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:51,477
so, "you can never work anywhere
in the world, you can't do anything

221
00:11:51,478 --> 00:11:53,062
except for work for me."

222
00:11:53,511 --> 00:11:54,896
That's not very good,

223
00:11:54,896 --> 00:11:59,914
most countries disallow
those super broad contracts,

224
00:12:00,085 --> 00:12:03,133
and what they are looking for
to be enforced

225
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,524
is something that's got
a very limited duration,

226
00:12:05,524 --> 00:12:07,117
a very narrow scope,

227
00:12:07,117 --> 00:12:09,705
both geographically
and technologically,

228
00:12:09,705 --> 00:12:11,594
or product-scope,

229
00:12:11,595 --> 00:12:16,350
so it could be, you cannot compete
in this particular region,

230
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:18,940
two years after you leave this company,

231
00:12:19,942 --> 00:12:23,065
and it can only have to do
with products in this certain area.

232
00:12:23,065 --> 00:12:28,483
So that would be a more enforceable
non-compete clause.

233
00:12:29,195 --> 00:12:31,833
So, why do we care about
non-compete clauses?

234
00:12:31,833 --> 00:12:33,440
Because you may have one now

235
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,192
if you are working for a company,

236
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:38,997
and you have to be careful
how this is handled.

237
00:12:38,997 --> 00:12:40,605
If you are going to quit the company

238
00:12:40,605 --> 00:12:42,166
and start a competing company,

239
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,461
then you might start
with a legal problem right off the bat.

240
00:12:46,568 --> 00:12:47,557
On the other hand,

241
00:12:47,557 --> 00:12:49,059
if it's a big boiler plate,

242
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,667
with lots of generic terms,
you're probably OK,

243
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:55,042
although, again,
I can't give you any legal advice,

244
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,965
because you have to check
with your own country,

245
00:12:56,965 --> 00:12:59,069
and your own rules,
in your own region, etc.

246
00:13:00,006 --> 00:13:03,409
If you are trying to hire some employees,

247
00:13:03,706 --> 00:13:06,072
if they've signed one
with the current employer,

248
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:09,456
you have to be careful about that

249
00:13:09,456 --> 00:13:10,594
and see how that works,

250
00:13:10,594 --> 00:13:14,284
make sure that they are not violating it,

251
00:13:14,284 --> 00:13:16,838
or if they are, if they are violating it
because is so general.

252
00:13:17,567 --> 00:13:20,933
And then, finally,
once you hire people,

253
00:13:20,933 --> 00:13:25,269
you might want to think about
how you want them to behave

254
00:13:25,269 --> 00:13:28,567
as non-competing employees,
so once they leave,

255
00:13:28,567 --> 00:13:30,985
what compensation
you are going to give to them,

256
00:13:30,985 --> 00:13:32,569
what kinds of restrictions.

257
00:13:32,569 --> 00:13:36,902
So again, I would advice
against this very generic, very broad,

258
00:13:36,902 --> 00:13:41,614
and try to make a narrow contract
with your own employees

259
00:13:41,614 --> 00:13:43,018
when you are hiring them,

260
00:13:43,018 --> 00:13:48,493
and the best time to do that
is before you actually offer them the job,

261
00:13:48,494 --> 00:13:51,568
or during the negotiation to hire them

262
00:13:51,568 --> 00:13:54,820
so that you can resolve
all these problems before.

263
00:13:54,950 --> 00:13:57,521
Bad time to do it
is after the person already left.

264
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:01,316
Right before they're about to leave,
you might have another opportunity,

265
00:14:01,316 --> 00:14:03,529
but then you are talking about
compensating them,

266
00:14:03,529 --> 00:14:05,266
and you have to have them sign something.

267
00:14:05,266 --> 00:14:09,071
By the way, the more
the employee negotiates,

268
00:14:09,071 --> 00:14:11,436
the more enforceable
the contract is, in general.

269
00:14:11,436 --> 00:14:14,701
Boiler plates stuff is
not so enforceable in general.

270
00:14:15,797 --> 00:14:18,602
Things that people negotiate
where they cross off a line here

271
00:14:18,602 --> 00:14:20,696
and say they want to do
this and that other thing,

272
00:14:20,696 --> 00:14:22,329
once you start negotiating

273
00:14:22,329 --> 00:14:24,712
then it's considered
to be a valid agreement

274
00:14:24,712 --> 00:14:27,686
that you have some power over
when you signed it.

275
00:14:28,165 --> 00:14:30,707
Be careful with non-compete clauses

276
00:14:30,707 --> 00:14:33,373
both for yourself, when you are leaving
another company,

277
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,391
and the ones that you are setting up
with your own employees.

278
00:14:38,353 --> 00:14:41,438
OK.Let's talk a little bit about
intellectual property strategy.

279
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:46,963
Here, we've already discussed
this week, IP in general,

280
00:14:46,963 --> 00:14:48,503
and now what we want to think about

281
00:14:48,503 --> 00:14:51,474
is what do you do when you want

282
00:14:51,474 --> 00:14:55,917
to move outside of your own borders,
of your own country.

283
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,444
If you don't think about this early on,

284
00:15:00,444 --> 00:15:02,427
sometimes you can get stuck in a situation

285
00:15:02,427 --> 00:15:06,967
where someone else owns
an invention that you made.

286
00:15:06,967 --> 00:15:09,081
So that's why is important
to think this through.

287
00:15:10,518 --> 00:15:16,226
Some intellectual property filings
can only be done early on.

288
00:15:17,471 --> 00:15:19,273
Some countries have these rules,

289
00:15:19,532 --> 00:15:21,720
"first inventor to file" rule,

290
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,483
so if you are multiple inventors,

291
00:15:23,638 --> 00:15:26,496
the first one to actually put the forms in

292
00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:32,617
is the one that has the right
to the intellectual property.

293
00:15:32,852 --> 00:15:35,094
Worst one is even "first to file".

294
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:37,047
Not many countries do this anymore,

295
00:15:37,796 --> 00:15:40,961
but still, that means that anybody
who hears about anything,

296
00:15:40,961 --> 00:15:43,777
who brings the forms in to the IP office,

297
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:47,179
then they are the ones
to have the patent on it,

298
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,102
regardless of whether someone
invented before them or not.

299
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:53,847
When you have an international filing,
this could be a little tricky,

300
00:15:53,847 --> 00:15:55,588
because you are working
in your own country,

301
00:15:55,588 --> 00:15:56,909
which makes sense,

302
00:15:57,101 --> 00:15:59,226
but then, when you want
to go to another country

303
00:15:59,226 --> 00:16:01,804
you find out that someone else
already has intellectual property

304
00:16:01,951 --> 00:16:04,209
based on your invention.

305
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:07,316
So you need to think about this
on the early side.

306
00:16:08,403 --> 00:16:10,620
Try and get the websites, trademarks,

307
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:13,650
even in other jurisdictions,
other countries,

308
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:17,429
you might want to try and get websites
and trademarks in other countries,

309
00:16:17,514 --> 00:16:19,804
patent filings if you can.

310
00:16:20,013 --> 00:16:23,167
Patent filings are expensive

311
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:25,028
to undertake in multiple jurisdictions,

312
00:16:25,028 --> 00:16:27,984
so it's a little bit tricky,
and we understand that it costs a lot,

313
00:16:27,984 --> 00:16:30,114
so you might not be able to do
all these things.

314
00:16:30,377 --> 00:16:33,776
One thing you might consider
is a patent-cooperation treaty application

315
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:35,081
which is PCT,

316
00:16:35,081 --> 00:16:39,470
which is valid and recognized
in multiple jurisdictions,

317
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:43,469
or, if you think that it's too expensive
to do any of these things

318
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,674
it might be advisable
to think about a disclosure,

319
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:50,038
especially if you have IP
in your own country,

320
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:52,585
to think about how
you might disclose it and publish it.

321
00:16:52,765 --> 00:16:55,697
That prevents other people
from getting patents on it.

322
00:16:55,697 --> 00:16:57,816
When you want to go to their country,

323
00:16:57,854 --> 00:17:01,331
then, at least, you have what people call
freedom to operate

324
00:17:01,331 --> 00:17:03,696
in the sense that you don't have to worry

325
00:17:03,696 --> 00:17:06,874
about violating or infringing
on someone else's patent,

326
00:17:06,874 --> 00:17:10,273
when you move to a new jurisdiction.

327
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,996
Now let's talk about product liability.

328
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:16,524
What if your product
or service has the possibility

329
00:17:16,524 --> 00:17:18,598
of doing damage to users?

330
00:17:18,832 --> 00:17:21,859
And again, this could be
actual physical damage.

331
00:17:21,859 --> 00:17:24,452
Someone could cut themselves
on your product,

332
00:17:24,452 --> 00:17:26,015
or it could be monetary damage

333
00:17:26,015 --> 00:17:28,681
where you advised to do something

334
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,666
and they follow your advices
or they use your service,

335
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,730
and they lose a lot of money.

336
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:38,079
These are what you generally call
product liability problems.

337
00:17:38,982 --> 00:17:42,531
You need to think this through
a little bit, make sure

338
00:17:42,531 --> 00:17:44,502
if you are designing something,

339
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:47,362
that they don't have problematic features.

340
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:51,016
The classic example here is
children's clothing

341
00:17:51,016 --> 00:17:54,502
that doesn't have a draw string
around the neck,

342
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,966
so kids don't chock themselves on it.

343
00:17:57,056 --> 00:18:01,365
Make sure you want to avoid
sharp edges on the edge

344
00:18:01,365 --> 00:18:03,912
of a product like a phone,

345
00:18:04,197 --> 00:18:06,405
you don't want to cut yourself on it.

346
00:18:06,405 --> 00:18:09,038
And then, once you've made sure

347
00:18:09,038 --> 00:18:11,925
that the designers know
how to avoid these features,

348
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:14,496
then, what you want to do is make sure

349
00:18:14,496 --> 00:18:18,704
that the manufacturing process
also doesn't introduce defects.

350
00:18:21,086 --> 00:18:23,045
And that means iterating
with the design group

351
00:18:23,321 --> 00:18:25,366
if it ever gets to that point.

352
00:18:26,685 --> 00:18:28,579
to make sure
that when building these things

353
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:32,364
that they don't have defects in them
that can cause damage;

354
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:34,574
you know, you don't want to blow up,

355
00:18:34,574 --> 00:18:37,069
you don't want them to cut people, etc.

356
00:18:38,378 --> 00:18:41,253
Clarify the intended use of the product.
What does that mean?

357
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,666
That means in certain countries

358
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:47,876
you could actually be held liable
for something

359
00:18:47,915 --> 00:18:52,750
that your product caused damage on,

360
00:18:52,751 --> 00:18:57,895
even if it wasn't used in the way
that you intended.

361
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,992
So, if you could imagine

362
00:18:59,992 --> 00:19:03,838
someone trying to shave with a cell phone,

363
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:05,379
and poking themselves in the eye,

364
00:19:05,379 --> 00:19:08,281
and saying, "A-ha!
Your product hurt my eye."

365
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:12,454
"Well, my product is not intended
to be used as a razor.

366
00:19:12,857 --> 00:19:15,239
My product is intended
to be used as a phone.

367
00:19:15,667 --> 00:19:20,873
So you have to think these
so called intended uses through,

368
00:19:20,873 --> 00:19:23,888
and make sure that people
who buy your product or service

369
00:19:23,888 --> 00:19:25,959
know what the intended use is.

370
00:19:26,855 --> 00:19:28,475
You want to get insurance,

371
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:33,699
there's all kinds of product
liability type insurance in the market,

372
00:19:33,699 --> 00:19:36,673
and you should probably think about that,

373
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:40,053
especially if you have
a lot of customers at some point

374
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:44,284
and you think that the product
might be possibly misused,

375
00:19:45,704 --> 00:19:47,212
you can try,

376
00:19:47,212 --> 00:19:48,630
it can't hurt,

377
00:19:48,726 --> 00:19:50,639
although it's unlikely.

378
00:19:50,639 --> 00:19:53,010
You can also get
some of your supply chain partners

379
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:56,397
sometimes you can get the retailers
to indemnify you if there is a problem,

380
00:19:56,397 --> 00:19:58,505
so try and negotiate

381
00:19:58,505 --> 00:20:01,043
with your supply chain partners
to share in the risk.

382
00:20:02,078 --> 00:20:03,990
Recall the product if it's necessary.

383
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:07,044
If you find that there is
something wrong with the product,

384
00:20:07,572 --> 00:20:10,792
then recalls are very expensive,
we know they are,

385
00:20:10,893 --> 00:20:13,401
but they are less expensive

386
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:18,097
than you being held liable
for fraud or negligence,

387
00:20:18,097 --> 00:20:19,660
because you know about something

388
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,101
and you didn't do anything

389
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:23,257
I hear about these stories,
all the time in the news,

390
00:20:23,257 --> 00:20:25,411
and it just doesn't make sense.

391
00:20:25,604 --> 00:20:28,801
Do not ignore problems
when they are brought to your attention.

392
00:20:28,801 --> 00:20:30,449
Because as soon as you ignore something,

393
00:20:30,449 --> 00:20:31,824
and someone can say: "A-ha!

394
00:20:31,824 --> 00:20:34,961
You were negligent
in dealing with this problem.

395
00:20:34,961 --> 00:20:37,629
You knew about this problem
and yet, you told no one about it

396
00:20:37,629 --> 00:20:39,879
and 10 more people die
because blah, blah, blah.

397
00:20:39,879 --> 00:20:44,694
So, don't ignore problems
when they are brought to your attention.

398
00:20:45,081 --> 00:20:47,437
Use the recall, obviously,
the cheapest solution

399
00:20:47,437 --> 00:20:49,821
is to fix things in the design phase.

400
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:53,409
And then, it's a little more expensive
to fix them in the manufacturing,

401
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:57,640
and then it's released to market

402
00:20:57,640 --> 00:20:59,472
and of course,
depending on the industry,

403
00:20:59,472 --> 00:21:01,889
you've got beta test,
you've got updates, etc.

404
00:21:03,452 --> 00:21:05,531
Once it's out there and commercialized

405
00:21:05,531 --> 00:21:08,672
then recalls are
the most expensive options.

406
00:21:09,318 --> 00:21:11,435
Beyond that, the worst option is

407
00:21:11,435 --> 00:21:14,541
being sued, held liable
for fraud, negligence,

408
00:21:14,541 --> 00:21:16,211
because you knew about a problem early on

409
00:21:16,211 --> 00:21:17,943
and you decided you didn't want to fix it

410
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,875
because it was going to be
too expensive to fix.

411
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,102
Be careful there,

412
00:21:21,102 --> 00:21:23,330
and make sure that you understand
these kinds of issues.

413
00:21:24,158 --> 00:21:26,917
OK, hopefully, I have not scared you away

414
00:21:26,917 --> 00:21:30,249
from actually... (laughs)
...working on your startup!

415
00:21:30,518 --> 00:21:31,959
Because working on your startup

416
00:21:31,959 --> 00:21:34,652
is really the most important and fun part
about this whole thing,

417
00:21:34,652 --> 00:21:37,972
and it's true that there are
a lot of legal issues here

418
00:21:37,972 --> 00:21:40,045
that may make it a little less fun.

419
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:43,235
So, usually, the best thing to do

420
00:21:43,235 --> 00:21:46,439
is to actually talk to an attorney.

421
00:21:46,439 --> 00:21:48,319
And you have to to find one.

422
00:21:48,505 --> 00:21:50,718
What I've done here is
I've given a little list

423
00:21:50,718 --> 00:21:52,215
of things you can think about

424
00:21:52,215 --> 00:21:55,134
when you are looking for an attorney.

425
00:21:56,243 --> 00:22:00,502
The first thing, does this person
have experience with startup companies?

426
00:22:00,502 --> 00:22:01,896
This is super important.

427
00:22:01,896 --> 00:22:04,770
You don't want to get anybody,
this friend of a friend;

428
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:09,153
"Oh, yeah, I've done some wills,
I can incorporate your company for you."

429
00:22:09,153 --> 00:22:11,644
So there it's tricky

430
00:22:11,644 --> 00:22:14,080
because you really, really, really
want to work with someone

431
00:22:14,174 --> 00:22:17,726
who has experience
with small companies.

432
00:22:18,579 --> 00:22:21,603
Preferably, someone with experience

433
00:22:21,603 --> 00:22:24,815
in the specific sector
in which you are operating.

434
00:22:25,058 --> 00:22:27,911
So, if you are doing a software product,

435
00:22:27,911 --> 00:22:30,826
and you find an attorney
who's an expert in biotech companies,

436
00:22:31,352 --> 00:22:34,821
you know...yes, the person's had
some experience with startups,

437
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:36,364
but maybe not in your sector,

438
00:22:36,364 --> 00:22:38,554
and it can also be
some very sector-specific things

439
00:22:38,554 --> 00:22:39,826
that you need to know about.

440
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:42,161
So it's preferable if you can find
someone with experience

441
00:22:42,161 --> 00:22:44,257
in the sector in which
you are operating.

442
00:22:45,649 --> 00:22:47,928
Has this person defended startups?

443
00:22:47,928 --> 00:22:49,633
They had problems in the past.

444
00:22:49,633 --> 00:22:52,118
Has this person <i>stood by</i>
startup companies in the past,

445
00:22:52,118 --> 00:22:54,113
or did they just run away?

446
00:22:54,253 --> 00:22:56,374
So you want to make sure

447
00:22:56,563 --> 00:23:01,582
that the startup lawyer,
has had some experience,

448
00:23:01,718 --> 00:23:06,162
working with and dealing with,
and sticking with startup companies,

449
00:23:06,436 --> 00:23:08,310
all the way through different processes.

450
00:23:09,674 --> 00:23:12,354
Has this person worked
on financing negotiation?

451
00:23:12,354 --> 00:23:16,381
Because it really is nice
if your lawyer understands

452
00:23:16,381 --> 00:23:18,868
the kinds of financing
you are going to get,

453
00:23:18,868 --> 00:23:20,221
that you expect to get,

454
00:23:20,221 --> 00:23:22,221
and can help you with negotiations

455
00:23:22,225 --> 00:23:24,998
because there are a bunch
of tricky legal issues,

456
00:23:25,113 --> 00:23:26,917
There's tax complications,

457
00:23:26,918 --> 00:23:29,631
tax consequences on a lot
of decisions that you make early on,

458
00:23:29,774 --> 00:23:32,934
and so, it's good if this person
has also worked

459
00:23:32,973 --> 00:23:35,217
on some kind of financing negotiations,

460
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:38,742
similar to the kind that you think
you are going to need.

461
00:23:39,197 --> 00:23:41,954
And of course, the last two
are more personal things,

462
00:23:41,954 --> 00:23:44,205
but do you have a referral
from a trusted colleague?

463
00:23:44,365 --> 00:23:46,569
Given the choice between two lawyers,

464
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:49,801
one of whom was
recommended by a friend of yours,

465
00:23:49,801 --> 00:23:51,757
or by someone who was
in the same industry as you,

466
00:23:51,757 --> 00:23:52,963
that you know personally,

467
00:23:52,963 --> 00:23:54,832
and someone else you don't know
anything about,

468
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:57,514
then, even if that person
is a little more expensive,

469
00:23:57,514 --> 00:24:00,368
it might make sense
to go with the referral.

470
00:24:00,368 --> 00:24:03,151
And finally, do you have
a personal rapport with the person?

471
00:24:03,151 --> 00:24:06,489
In other words, do you get along
with the person, can you trust the person,

472
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:09,345
can you reveal things to the attorney,

473
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:12,629
and can you get an honest opinion,
and give your honest opinion as well.

474
00:24:12,629 --> 00:24:14,661
So that's a very,
very important part of this.

475
00:24:15,207 --> 00:24:18,192
So, that's it for legal issues,

476
00:24:18,693 --> 00:24:22,863
as again, I hope I haven't been
too scary trying to lay out

477
00:24:22,863 --> 00:24:24,752
all the potential problems that you have;

478
00:24:24,752 --> 00:24:27,021
But I think, in general,
for startup companies,

479
00:24:27,021 --> 00:24:30,813
it's good to understand
the potential problems early on,

480
00:24:30,813 --> 00:24:32,950
and try to figure out a way
to mitigate them,

481
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:37,583
rather than being surprised
by problems later on in the process.

482
00:24:38,646 --> 00:24:41,138
So I hope you find this useful,
and stay tuned,

483
00:24:41,486 --> 00:24:44,598
we're going to come back next
and talk about growth.
