Welcome to week two,
and thanks for coming back.

3
00:00:32,214 --> 00:00:33,729
In this week we are going to cover

4
00:00:33,729 --> 00:00:36,362
actually one of the earliest steps
in the entrepreneurship process

5
00:00:36,362 --> 00:00:39,024
which is opportunity identification
and we are going to talk about

6
00:00:39,024 --> 00:00:40,489
how you identify good opportunities,

7
00:00:40,489 --> 00:00:43,113
we are going to talk about 
what opportunities you might not see.

8
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:45,992
We try to understand the drivers
of opportunity identification,

9
00:00:45,992 --> 00:00:48,808
and we are going to suggest to you

10
00:00:48,808 --> 00:00:51,281
ways in which you can actually 
evaluate opportunities

11
00:00:51,281 --> 00:00:55,044
so you can understand which opportunities
provide a more fertile ground than others.

12
00:00:55,044 --> 00:00:57,056
So if you think about
the enterpreneurship process

13
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:59,486
at that stage, it's really about you
and the opportunities.

14
00:00:59,486 --> 00:01:01,621
So if you think about
the opportunity for one

15
00:01:02,245 --> 00:01:06,545
it's about finding an opportunity 
that provides the most fertile ground

16
00:01:06,545 --> 00:01:09,205
for firm creation,
but you also should keep in mind

17
00:01:09,205 --> 00:01:11,620
that the type of the opportunity
that you are exploiting

18
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,708
shapes the type of identity
that your firm will assume.

19
00:01:15,708 --> 00:01:18,839
It's the organization's identity,
the firm's identity,

20
00:01:18,839 --> 00:01:20,768
who you are as an organization.

21
00:01:20,768 --> 00:01:25,263
Also, who you are as an entrepreneur
and your team may also shape

22
00:01:25,263 --> 00:01:28,154
the kinds of opportunities
that you see, and that you pursue.

23
00:01:28,154 --> 00:01:32,922
So, it's also important to think about
the entrepreneur himself or herself

24
00:01:32,922 --> 00:01:36,110
and what the knowledge of that person is
and the experience of that person,

25
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,030
and the experience of the whole team.

26
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,535
So, this week we are going
to introduce you to the concept

27
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:42,973
of <i>technological fungibility,</i>

28
00:01:42,973 --> 00:01:46,297
which is basically the fact
that a technology could be applied

29
00:01:46,297 --> 00:01:47,699
to multiple markets.

30
00:01:47,699 --> 00:01:49,217
In other words, this means

31
00:01:49,217 --> 00:01:51,451
that you might have
multiple market opportunitites

32
00:01:51,451 --> 00:01:52,801
to which you can cater.

33
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:54,908
That is providing you
with strategic choice

34
00:01:54,908 --> 00:01:56,871
at that early stage of firm creation.

35
00:01:56,871 --> 00:01:59,681
And that also means
that you can pick the best opportunity

36
00:01:59,681 --> 00:02:01,913
and maybe diversify into others.

37
00:02:01,913 --> 00:02:05,470
We will walk you through
this concept later on in more detail.

38
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:08,236
So this raises the question
of which type of opportunitites

39
00:02:08,236 --> 00:02:09,853
can you actually see.

40
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:11,472
Research has shown

41
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:17,298
that most entrepreneurs don't look
at the full landscape of opportunities;

42
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:21,641
instead, they focus on more
interelated opportunities

43
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,058
and not consider the broader range
that are possible.

44
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:26,529
Exactly, and this raises the question 
of why do they do this,

45
00:02:26,529 --> 00:02:28,642
and we are going
to investigate that question.

46
00:02:28,642 --> 00:02:31,233
You know, prior knowledge
is an important driver.

47
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:33,319
One key issue that arises then,

48
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:36,133
is how can you actually see more
of that opportunity landscape

49
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:39,244
that could also then provide you
with some strategic choice,

50
00:02:39,244 --> 00:02:41,925
with more choices to pick
your opportunities from.

51
00:02:42,569 --> 00:02:46,509
So once you've seen multiple opportunities
the natural question arises--

52
00:02:46,509 --> 00:02:48,590
which of these opportunities
is the better one?

53
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,176
So we have dedicated one segment

54
00:02:50,176 --> 00:02:52,855
on the question of which is
the best oppportunity

55
00:02:52,855 --> 00:02:54,470
that you have potentially at your hand,

56
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:56,855
so you are going to walk you
through 7 easy steps

57
00:02:56,855 --> 00:02:59,300
on how to evaluate and test
multiple opportunities

58
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,241
and find out which is
the best one for firm creation.

59
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:06,026
So you see, we focused on the essentials
of the opportunity identification process

60
00:03:06,026 --> 00:03:08,911
what opportunities you see,
what types of opportunities you don't see,

61
00:03:08,911 --> 00:03:11,562
- who you evaluate those,--
- and how you test them.

62
00:03:11,562 --> 00:03:14,451
And so, this is going to help you
in the first step

63
00:03:14,451 --> 00:03:17,692
of your entrepreneurial journey,
so stay with us.
