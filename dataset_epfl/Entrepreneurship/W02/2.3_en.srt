1
00:00:08,997 --> 00:00:12,524
Hello, and welcome to this segment
on market opportunity evaluation.

2
00:00:12,524 --> 00:00:14,665
It's actually called
"Look Before You Leap!"

3
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:17,458
It's called that way because
that's exactly what you should do:

4
00:00:17,458 --> 00:00:19,587
look before you leap
into a market domain.

5
00:00:19,934 --> 00:00:23,430
What he have seen time and again
is that novice entrepreneurs

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,736
actually enter the first market domain
which they consider,

7
00:00:26,736 --> 00:00:29,673
and this is actually not a process
that we can recommend,

8
00:00:29,673 --> 00:00:31,864
because all of the results
that exist out there

9
00:00:31,864 --> 00:00:34,959
tell you that you should first look
at multiple opportunities

10
00:00:35,536 --> 00:00:38,545
and then decide which one
is the one you should exploit.

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:43,219
Building on that theme,
in this segment we want to understand

12
00:00:43,219 --> 00:00:45,583
which is actually
a very good opportunity.

13
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:48,368
Which type of opportunity provides you

14
00:00:48,368 --> 00:00:51,621
with the most fertile ground
for your firm creation processes.

15
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:53,784
As you remember,
not all opportunities are alike,

16
00:00:53,784 --> 00:00:59,148
so we need to understand what features
are attractive in opportunities

17
00:00:59,148 --> 00:01:03,540
and which features help you
to then create a successful firm.

18
00:01:03,832 --> 00:01:07,862
In the last segment we talked
about the firm growth options.

19
00:01:07,862 --> 00:01:10,963
That's exactly what
this picture here depicts,

20
00:01:10,963 --> 00:01:13,403
and as you remember,
we had these multiple opportunities

21
00:01:13,403 --> 00:01:15,328
that stem from your technology.

22
00:01:15,328 --> 00:01:18,435
The question arises,
which of these market opportunities

23
00:01:18,435 --> 00:01:22,297
is actually a good one to enter
for your organization?

24
00:01:23,995 --> 00:01:27,819
You can break up this question
into a couple of core questions

25
00:01:27,819 --> 00:01:31,382
and some additional questions
that we will discuss later on,

26
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:36,066
but in essence, it boils down
to an economic rationale.

27
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:39,466
Which market domain provides you
with the most fertile ground

28
00:01:39,466 --> 00:01:41,271
for your firm creation?

29
00:01:41,271 --> 00:01:46,757
Meaning some markets are more attractive
than others to be entered.

30
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:51,516
Second, it boils down to another issue
that is more on the organizational level.

31
00:01:51,516 --> 00:01:54,928
The market you will be entering
shapes the identity of your organization,

32
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:57,227
who you are as an organization.

33
00:01:57,227 --> 00:01:59,928
Depending on the type of market you enter,

34
00:01:59,928 --> 00:02:03,721
this could come out fairly differently.

35
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,154
Thirdly, and we haven't
discussed that so much,

36
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:10,978
there might be some domains you feel
more passion about than other domains.

37
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,982
So, your passion is actually
a strong driver in entrepreneurship

38
00:02:15,982 --> 00:02:20,033
because it releases energy,
you have much more attention

39
00:02:20,033 --> 00:02:23,051
towards issues
that you are passionate about,

40
00:02:23,051 --> 00:02:26,230
so you shouldn't forget
about that third component either,

41
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:29,027
and probably, you are already
drawn to domains

42
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:31,340
where you say
"I have a lot of passion for."

43
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:34,326
If these domains provide fertile ground,

44
00:02:34,326 --> 00:02:36,476
this is wonderful.

45
00:02:36,476 --> 00:02:38,621
But there might be a tradeoff

46
00:02:38,621 --> 00:02:41,449
where these domains
do not provide fertile ground.

47
00:02:42,509 --> 00:02:45,146
The domain you're passionate about
might not provide you

48
00:02:45,146 --> 00:02:49,452
with the requisite number of products sold

49
00:02:49,452 --> 00:02:52,988
that would help you create
a company that is successful.

50
00:02:54,268 --> 00:02:55,975
Once it becomes a tradeoff question,

51
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,445
this is actually
an important question to consider,

52
00:02:58,445 --> 00:03:01,245
because you might learn
to love a domain as well,

53
00:03:01,245 --> 00:03:05,192
once you have seen
your success in that domain,

54
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:07,890
you might say, "OK, this is
a wonderful domain to be in,"

55
00:03:07,890 --> 00:03:11,077
and now you start becoming
passionate about it.

56
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:13,629
OK, it's a little bit
like love at first sight,

57
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:15,349
and at second sight,
and at third sight.

58
00:03:16,369 --> 00:03:18,368
Keep this in mind and we will look now

59
00:03:18,368 --> 00:03:21,266
at some more detailed questions
that help you understand

60
00:03:21,266 --> 00:03:23,486
how to evaluate
your market opportunities.

61
00:03:24,184 --> 00:03:26,179
In order to understand
whether your opportunity

62
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:31,225
provides you with fertile ground
to grow and nurture your venture,

63
00:03:31,225 --> 00:03:34,913
there are a couple of questions
that you might want to ask yourself

64
00:03:34,913 --> 00:03:37,455
and address and think about,

65
00:03:37,455 --> 00:03:39,994
and we have listed them on this slide.

66
00:03:41,374 --> 00:03:44,424
These questions are,
of course, interrelated,

67
00:03:44,424 --> 00:03:48,634
but it helps you to walk through
each one of these questions one by one

68
00:03:48,634 --> 00:03:53,220
because each of these questions
address an important issue.

69
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:56,087
We have differentiated
between a Customer perspective,

70
00:03:56,087 --> 00:03:58,848
the Market perspective,
the Economic perspective,

71
00:03:58,848 --> 00:04:01,899
the exploitation perspective
and the Venture Development perspective.

72
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:04,757
The first one is the customer perspective.

73
00:04:04,757 --> 00:04:07,361
The customer perspective
is a highly critical one.

74
00:04:07,361 --> 00:04:12,050
As Peter Drucker said, you do not
create a company for creating a product,

75
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,192
you create a company to create a market.

76
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:19,379
The customer is really the starting point
for creating the market.

77
00:04:19,379 --> 00:04:23,241
The key issue here is whether
the customer really feels pain

78
00:04:23,241 --> 00:04:24,981
because he does not have your product.

79
00:04:26,485 --> 00:04:29,323
How strong is his need for your product?

80
00:04:29,323 --> 00:04:32,286
There are products that he says,
"I may have this one,"

81
00:04:32,286 --> 00:04:34,722
and there are products where he says,
"I should have this one,"

82
00:04:35,326 --> 00:04:38,674
and there are products which he says,
"I <i>must</i> have this one."

83
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:44,202
I think it's very obvious
that once you have a must-have product

84
00:04:44,202 --> 00:04:45,833
that you could propose to the customer,

85
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,810
that this will be a much,
much easier sale.

86
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,336
The second point is that you
should try to quantify the benefit

87
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:55,770
that the customer gets from your product.

88
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:59,893
This is oftentimes much easier to be done
in a business to business settings,

89
00:04:59,893 --> 00:05:03,644
where you, for instance,
have a more efficient solution,

90
00:05:03,644 --> 00:05:07,744
but this can also be done
for business to customer relationships

91
00:05:07,744 --> 00:05:09,130
where you are trying to understand

92
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:12,150
how much benefit does this customer
get out of your product.

93
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:13,702
For instance, if you create an app,

94
00:05:13,702 --> 00:05:21,156
that app might facilitate the customer's 
search for information and save him time.

95
00:05:21,158 --> 00:05:22,921
That's a real value.

96
00:05:22,921 --> 00:05:27,227
Or, link him up with new types
of information, which he would not have.

97
00:05:27,227 --> 00:05:28,768
That's real value.

98
00:05:30,298 --> 00:05:32,754
It boils down to the question,
do you have a customer

99
00:05:32,754 --> 00:05:36,290
who has a strong need
for your product in front of you?

100
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:40,755
Or is this more like a should-have
or a may-have type of product?

101
00:05:41,877 --> 00:05:45,187
If it's the latter two, there are ways,
in terms of marketing,

102
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:49,395
which can increase the feeling of need,

103
00:05:49,395 --> 00:05:51,840
but there's only so much you can do there.

104
00:05:52,292 --> 00:05:54,738
The next point here
is the market perspective.

105
00:05:54,738 --> 00:05:59,097
The market perspective is one level up,
if you want to put it this way,

106
00:05:59,097 --> 00:06:00,808
from the customer perspective.

107
00:06:00,808 --> 00:06:04,209
It's basically the aggregation
of all the customers you have,

108
00:06:04,209 --> 00:06:06,453
and the question is,
what is the market size?

109
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:11,320
How many people, how many companies
would be in this market

110
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:13,494
that could potentially buy my product?

111
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:17,314
And, over time, is this a growing segment?

112
00:06:18,344 --> 00:06:20,686
Or is this a stagnating segment,
or even declining segment?

113
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:25,193
Of course, the growing segment
provides more fertile ground over time,

114
00:06:25,193 --> 00:06:27,637
but also, if you have
a strong value proposition,

115
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:33,286
customer pain that you can address,

116
00:06:33,286 --> 00:06:36,624
then even a declining segment might be OK,

117
00:06:36,624 --> 00:06:39,290
but still, a growing segment
makes it easier

118
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,783
because you do not have to fight
head to head with your competition

119
00:06:42,783 --> 00:06:45,050
about market shares that are declining.

120
00:06:45,626 --> 00:06:47,355
The third element
that you want to consider

121
00:06:47,355 --> 00:06:49,216
is the economic perspective.

122
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:54,266
This perspective, actually, is critical
to the viability of your venture.

123
00:06:54,772 --> 00:06:58,406
It means that you protect costs
and try to understand

124
00:06:58,406 --> 00:07:01,557
whether you can actually achieve
prices in your market

125
00:07:02,277 --> 00:07:03,910
so that you can cover these costs.

126
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:07,974
Ideally, with a margin, so that it
can make profits over time.

127
00:07:10,184 --> 00:07:12,164
The point here is one where you'd say,

128
00:07:12,185 --> 00:07:15,205
"It's the business model
that I have for my venture,

129
00:07:15,205 --> 00:07:20,050
it's the processes of the costs
and the profits leading me to say,

130
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,596
'This is a sustainable venture,
this is a viable venture.'"

131
00:07:22,596 --> 00:07:25,020
So this economic perspective
is highly critical

132
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,371
and you should assess it.

133
00:07:26,371 --> 00:07:28,434
Of course, you do not have
sufficient information

134
00:07:28,434 --> 00:07:30,238
in all dimensions in the beginning,

135
00:07:30,238 --> 00:07:33,662
but this is a learning journey
as we pointed out already before.

136
00:07:34,309 --> 00:07:38,216
Another point is what is the speed
of revenue generation?

137
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:45,942
If you consider revenue generation,
this is cashflow coming into your company.

138
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:49,086
This is air that you breathe
in the company,

139
00:07:49,086 --> 00:07:53,549
so this means the quicker
you are in achieving revenues,

140
00:07:53,549 --> 00:07:57,929
the easier it will get for you
to actually survive with your company.

141
00:07:58,289 --> 00:08:01,531
The fourth element discussed here
is the exploitation perspective.

142
00:08:01,531 --> 00:08:05,419
It moves a bit more into 
opportunity exploitation over time.

143
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:08,889
The question here is 
that you need to ask yourself,

144
00:08:08,889 --> 00:08:13,741
can you or do you already have
the competencies that you need to have

145
00:08:13,741 --> 00:08:17,097
in order to produce your product
and commercialize your product?

146
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:19,832
The second issue is your network.

147
00:08:20,372 --> 00:08:23,052
This is typically very critical
entrepreneurship too,

148
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:26,167
because you are relying
on network resources.

149
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,130
You hardly have any resources
in the beginning,

150
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:30,478
so you're relying on network resources.

151
00:08:30,478 --> 00:08:32,857
It could be knowledge support,
financial support,

152
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:36,965
support in reaching
potential customers, etc.,

153
00:08:36,965 --> 00:08:38,574
but it's highly critical.

154
00:08:38,574 --> 00:08:42,367
So, the question is, some 
of these opportunities that you will see

155
00:08:42,367 --> 00:08:46,458
you could get a lot of support for
in your network,

156
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:50,662
and some other opportunities,
you could get little support for

157
00:08:50,662 --> 00:08:52,808
when you try to exploit
those opportunities.

158
00:08:52,908 --> 00:08:56,570
Finally, on that front you ask yourself,

159
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:59,686
"What are the chances
of winning in this market?"

160
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:05,045
Are there some ruthless competitors
that might out-compete you

161
00:09:05,045 --> 00:09:10,522
because they lower the price
below any reasonable value,

162
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:12,400
just to keep you out?

163
00:09:14,155 --> 00:09:17,571
Or, there might be markets
which are more benevolent

164
00:09:17,571 --> 00:09:23,179
where you say, "OK, this is providing me
with some peace of mind.

165
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:26,212
I can move forward,
my customer likes the product,

166
00:09:26,212 --> 00:09:30,121
the competition is not 
so ruthless. Let's do that."

167
00:09:31,229 --> 00:09:36,113
Finally, and let's move then more closely
into the venture development perspective,

168
00:09:36,113 --> 00:09:39,357
you need to ask yourself,
is the window of opportunity open?

169
00:09:39,357 --> 00:09:42,055
Is this actually a market
that I can enter now

170
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:44,562
and where customers are ready
to buy my product?

171
00:09:44,562 --> 00:09:48,371
Or is this a market that might take
a little time to develop and unfold?

172
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:53,808
So your activities could actually
help you create that market,

173
00:09:53,808 --> 00:09:56,801
but be aware that this takes some time,

174
00:09:56,801 --> 00:10:01,073
because you are investing
in developing that market

175
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:04,190
and customers might not be 
present so much

176
00:10:04,190 --> 00:10:08,588
and ready to spend 
significant sums on your product.

177
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:11,670
So, opportunities come and go,

178
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:17,101
so try to assess this timing dimension too
when you are looking at opportunities.

179
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:19,507
The other point
that you need to think of

180
00:10:19,507 --> 00:10:21,961
is whether the market opportunity
that you're looking at

181
00:10:21,961 --> 00:10:26,355
actually provides you with some grounds
to step into other domains later on,

182
00:10:26,491 --> 00:10:28,375
where you could diversify.

183
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,302
So is that one market oportunity

184
00:10:31,302 --> 00:10:37,187
providing you with this leveraging
potential for the future?

185
00:10:37,886 --> 00:10:40,395
Think of very attractive markets

186
00:10:40,395 --> 00:10:43,927
that help you shape
your organizational identity

187
00:10:43,927 --> 00:10:47,688
in a favorable way, that other people
will look favorably upon your product,

188
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:49,642
and this favorable view of your product

189
00:10:49,642 --> 00:10:52,833
could then translate into easier
access into another market.

190
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:57,330
Finally, the question arises,
can you defend your position over time?

191
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:01,951
There are some markets
where innovation cycles are so quick,

192
00:11:01,951 --> 00:11:04,228
that you need to invest a lot

193
00:11:04,228 --> 00:11:08,107
into updating your capabilities,
updating your products,

194
00:11:08,107 --> 00:11:11,844
so that you might not be able to 
defend your position over time

195
00:11:11,844 --> 00:11:14,671
because competitors
might out-compete you

196
00:11:14,671 --> 00:11:16,890
and provide even better products.

197
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:20,027
So that question is also one.

198
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:23,119
As you see, there are lots
of important issues to be considered,

199
00:11:23,119 --> 00:11:26,102
so market evaluation is not an easy task,

200
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,384
especially when some 
of these dimensions might be uncertain.

201
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,853
Some of these elements
you might not know.

202
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,220
This can never be
a completely scientific task,

203
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:40,618
saying, "This is exactly the opportunity
that provides me with the best option."

204
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:46,814
It's rather trying to give you
some intuition,

205
00:11:46,814 --> 00:11:49,014
but it's more than intuition,

206
00:11:49,014 --> 00:11:51,893
it is intuition that is
backed up with knowledge.

207
00:11:52,786 --> 00:11:56,131
Between intuition
and complete understanding,

208
00:11:56,131 --> 00:11:58,991
which market you want to address,

209
00:11:58,991 --> 00:12:02,657
there is this middle ground
that you can occupy,

210
00:12:02,657 --> 00:12:04,910
and that's where I ask you to go.

211
00:12:05,229 --> 00:12:06,731
Try to get information,

212
00:12:06,731 --> 00:12:09,941
make an informed opinion 
as much as it can be,

213
00:12:09,941 --> 00:12:11,764
before you can commit to your market,

214
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,646
because remember
what we said in the beginning,

215
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:15,272
it's look before you leap!

216
00:12:15,272 --> 00:12:17,015
In conclusion, this is really the idea

217
00:12:17,015 --> 00:12:19,460
"I have multiple market opportunities

218
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,492
that I could potentially exploit."

219
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:25,530
You see this here.
You evaluate these opportunities.

220
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:27,205
You choose the most fertile ground

221
00:12:27,205 --> 00:12:30,773
where you say, "This is a field
I have passion for,

222
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:34,240
this is a field where I like
the type of organization that I create."

223
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:38,025
You enter that domain and then, over time,
if this one works out you can have

224
00:12:38,025 --> 00:12:41,342
multiple ways of entering
other domains as well.

225
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:44,313
This is life as an entrepreneur,
it's an exciting journey,

226
00:12:44,313 --> 00:12:47,052
and this journey does not end
and should not end

227
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:49,258
with the first market that you enter.

228
00:12:49,548 --> 00:12:53,341
Rather, see this as
building a larger corporation

229
00:12:53,341 --> 00:12:56,573
that is catering to many domains.

230
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,118
OK, thank you very much.

231
00:12:58,118 --> 00:13:00,526
I look forward to seeing you
in the next segment.
