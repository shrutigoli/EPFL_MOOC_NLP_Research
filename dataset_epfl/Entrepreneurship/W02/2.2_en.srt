00:00:07,961 --> 00:00:11,255
Hello and welcome back to the MOOC
on launching new ventures.

2
00:00:11,255 --> 00:00:13,211
In this segment, 
you're going to hear about

3
00:00:13,211 --> 00:00:15,437
the key factors 
affecting opportunity identification.

4
00:00:16,573 --> 00:00:18,207
Conventionally, people may think,

5
00:00:18,207 --> 00:00:22,789
opportunity identification 
relies on serendipitous discoveries,

6
00:00:22,789 --> 00:00:25,058
meaning you stumble upon an opportunity.

7
00:00:25,566 --> 00:00:27,297
This is not necessarily the case.

8
00:00:27,297 --> 00:00:30,518
Actually there are lots 
of research that shows now

9
00:00:30,518 --> 00:00:34,384
how you may systematically enhance 
your ability to identify opportunities,

10
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:39,651
in that way, not rely so much on luck,
the luck component in this whole process,

11
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:43,350
which is also dissatisfying 
if you only wait for chance to happen.

12
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,357
The quick question becomes actually

13
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:48,422
which factors are driving 
opportunity identification?

14
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:52,041
And if you'll relate those insights 
that you will gain in that module

15
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,755
back to the previous segment,

16
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:55,753
where we talked about 
technological resources,

17
00:00:55,753 --> 00:01:00,691
you will actually have a nice overview
of the technology side and the market side

18
00:01:00,691 --> 00:01:02,626
that is driving your business.

19
00:01:02,626 --> 00:01:04,744
Researches have found 
a couple of key elements

20
00:01:04,744 --> 00:01:09,075
that are systematically shaping 
the type of opportunities you can see,

21
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:11,234
the number of opportunities you can see,

22
00:01:11,234 --> 00:01:13,578
and the variety of 
opportunities you can see.

23
00:01:13,761 --> 00:01:15,689
So let's look at these factors
in more detail.

24
00:01:15,689 --> 00:01:16,940
One is <i>alertness.</i>

25
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:20,574
Another one is <i>prior knowledge</i>,
the third one is <i>cognitive flexibility.</i>

26
00:01:20,574 --> 00:01:22,339
So what does <i>alertness</i> mean?

27
00:01:22,339 --> 00:01:25,198
Alertness really means that you are awake,

28
00:01:25,198 --> 00:01:28,334
that you are sensitive 
to opportunity identification.

29
00:01:28,334 --> 00:01:32,324
Some people might walk past opportunities
but don't see that there's an opportunity

30
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:33,872
because their mind is somewhere else.

31
00:01:33,872 --> 00:01:34,874
Alertness means

32
00:01:34,874 --> 00:01:38,513
you don't actively search for opportunity
but rather stumble upon it.

33
00:01:38,513 --> 00:01:40,823
But the question is, 
"Can you practice to be more alert?"

34
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:41,805
Yes, you can.

35
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:44,839
You can read the newspaper 
in a more alert fashion,

36
00:01:44,839 --> 00:01:47,137
you can read the Internet 
in a more alert fashion.

37
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:50,255
Always ask, "Well, is this problem 
that I am seeing here

38
00:01:50,255 --> 00:01:53,844
actually an opportunity to do business?"

39
00:01:53,844 --> 00:01:56,746
The second element that's important 
is <i>Prior knowledge.</i>

40
00:01:56,746 --> 00:01:58,076
What we have seen in research

41
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:00,828
is that people tend
to identify opportunities

42
00:02:00,828 --> 00:02:02,794
in the domains
that they already know well.

43
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,870
For instance, 
markets that they know well,

44
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:08,027
customer segments that they know well.

45
00:02:08,027 --> 00:02:11,122
So it's market knowledge, 
knowledge of customer problems,

46
00:02:11,122 --> 00:02:14,584
and other types of knowledge that drive
the opportunity identification.

47
00:02:15,758 --> 00:02:17,386
and process as well.

48
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:22,177
Finally, you have a third factor,
<i>cognitive flexibility</i>

49
00:02:22,177 --> 00:02:24,651
that is shaping the opportunity 
identification process.

50
00:02:24,651 --> 00:02:28,105
It's the ability for entrepreneurs to see
zoomed in and zoom out,

51
00:02:28,105 --> 00:02:30,051
from the more general
to the more specific.

52
00:02:30,176 --> 00:02:32,881
And also to look at problems 
from multiple angles.

53
00:02:32,881 --> 00:02:35,000
Let us look at the concept of Alertness.

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,470
As we have just seen,

55
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:39,245
is the propensity to identify
opportunities without searching.

56
00:02:39,245 --> 00:02:41,214
So it's the "stumble upon" an idea.

57
00:02:41,214 --> 00:02:45,669
One of the prime examples of this way
of opportunity identification is IKEA.

58
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:48,074
Actually, IKEA, you may know that company,

59
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:51,624
It's a furniture store 
that is producing flat-packaged,

60
00:02:51,634 --> 00:02:57,111
self-pickup furniture, 
that is modular, ready to assemble.

61
00:02:57,111 --> 00:02:59,869
Most of you have probably engaged

62
00:02:59,869 --> 00:03:05,275
in building an IKEA chair
and building an IKEA table before.

63
00:03:05,275 --> 00:03:08,831
But it's quite interesting to see 
how that concept came about.

64
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:14,632
It was a co-worker, who, in the 1950s
tried to remove the legs of a table

65
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:16,670
in order to fit that table in a car.

66
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,553
And in doing so, he had this idea

67
00:03:19,553 --> 00:03:22,522
of creating furniture
that would be ready to assemble

68
00:03:22,522 --> 00:03:26,445
and could be more easily transportable 
to the homes of people.

69
00:03:26,445 --> 00:03:29,217
Very much the concept of IKEA
that we still see today.

70
00:03:29,972 --> 00:03:33,363
Another key element that is shaping
the opportunity identification process

71
00:03:33,363 --> 00:03:34,533
is your <i>Prior knowledge.</i>

72
00:03:34,533 --> 00:03:36,687
Think about your knowledge 
of customer problems,

73
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:39,583
think about your knowledge 
about market trends, etc.

74
00:03:40,137 --> 00:03:42,873
What is important to reflect on

75
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:46,572
is how heterogeneous,
how different that knowledge is

76
00:03:46,572 --> 00:03:49,289
that you possess,
and your team members possess.

77
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:55,369
What we know from lots of research is that
a key drive of opportunity identification

78
00:03:55,369 --> 00:04:00,820
that's this heterogeneous knowledge 
in a team, meaning specifically

79
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:04,406
that you have different sets
of exposure to customer problems

80
00:04:04,406 --> 00:04:07,062
that exist out there in the market,

81
00:04:07,698 --> 00:04:09,118
that tends to be higher

82
00:04:09,118 --> 00:04:12,076
if you have different 
age groups in your company,

83
00:04:12,076 --> 00:04:15,239
if you have different types 
of industry experience in your company,

84
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,534
you come from different
social levels, etc.

85
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:21,649
So in other words,

86
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,728
if you have a homogeneous team,
you might say we're quite limited

87
00:04:24,728 --> 00:04:28,021
in types of customer problems 
that we can see.

88
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:31,214
That means I might have
to reach out to other people

89
00:04:31,214 --> 00:04:32,888
who come from different age groups,

90
00:04:32,888 --> 00:04:37,333
who have a different industry experience,
who come from different social levels,

91
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:40,817
in order to understand customer problems
that I might not be able to see.

92
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:44,106
Another element shaping 
the opportunity identification process

93
00:04:44,106 --> 00:04:47,471
is your <i>Cognitive Flexibility</i>
and your <i>Creativity.</i>

94
00:04:47,471 --> 00:04:51,231
I've pointed out earlier in this MOOC
that really good entrepreneurs

95
00:04:51,231 --> 00:04:54,523
are able to look at opportunities,
at problems from multiple angles.

96
00:04:54,523 --> 00:04:57,574
They can change 
their perspective on problems

97
00:04:57,574 --> 00:04:59,993
and thereby, identify novel solutions.

98
00:04:59,993 --> 00:05:05,191
Let me make a little game with you
in order to drive home that point.

99
00:05:05,191 --> 00:05:10,472
You see on that slide here,
5 dots times 5 dots.

100
00:05:10,472 --> 00:05:16,666
So 25 dots in total, and the task would be
to link those dots with straight lines.

101
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:19,100
The question is, 
how many straight lines do you need

102
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:23,101
in order to link all of these dots
without lifting the pen off the paper?

103
00:05:23,101 --> 00:05:26,349
So one solution 
might be the following one.

104
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:37,434
And this is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8
straight lines that are connected.

105
00:05:37,434 --> 00:05:38,414
The question is,

106
00:05:38,414 --> 00:05:41,565
are there other opportunities
to link those dots?

107
00:05:41,565 --> 00:05:45,993
And the goal is of course 
to have fewer and fewer lines as possible.

108
00:05:46,455 --> 00:05:49,109
One way, and please try this at home,

109
00:05:49,109 --> 00:05:53,319
and I give you half a minute to try this
and think about this problem.

110
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:57,283
If you do not have 
the slide in front of you

111
00:05:57,283 --> 00:06:01,968
just draw up these 25 dots in front of you

112
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:04,092
and try to connect them.

113
00:06:11,877 --> 00:06:15,787
OK? So these are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 lines.

114
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:20,366
They should be of course straight lines
so forgive me that it's a bit shaky,

115
00:06:20,366 --> 00:06:22,603
but it's very hard to draw
on this monitor.

116
00:06:22,603 --> 00:06:25,678
Why do many people
not arrive at this solution?

117
00:06:25,678 --> 00:06:29,678
Because you typically do not want 
to extend the space of your paper

118
00:06:29,678 --> 00:06:32,718
and draw for instance on your desk 
if you want to do this.

119
00:06:32,718 --> 00:06:34,340
So it's a bit thinking out of the box.

120
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,505
Another solution is the following.

121
00:06:37,473 --> 00:06:40,831
You might actually say, "OK,
I used a very, very thick pen,

122
00:06:40,831 --> 00:06:42,885
a much thicker pen that I use here."

123
00:06:42,885 --> 00:06:47,027
Say, I use actually one line, 
and that line cuts across like this.

124
00:06:47,027 --> 00:06:50,786
So you would have 
a very strong line like this.

125
00:06:51,403 --> 00:06:53,717
Another one would be, 
and if I could lift that up,

126
00:06:53,717 --> 00:06:56,074
if you have a paper,
you can draw this, you make a cylinder

127
00:06:56,074 --> 00:07:00,560
and actually have a line, a spiral 
that spirals around the cylinder.

128
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,834
Yeah, which is also one line.

129
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:05,965
Another solution would be
to fold your paper up

130
00:07:05,965 --> 00:07:08,257
and actually have all the dots 
on top of each other

131
00:07:08,257 --> 00:07:12,751
so you actually need only a dot 
to connect these different dots

132
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:16,005
which is like a minor line
if you would want to say that.

133
00:07:16,909 --> 00:07:20,958
But what this tells us is that you need 
some cognitive flexibility and creativity

134
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,766
to come up with new solutions.

135
00:07:22,766 --> 00:07:26,223
In that case, you come up 
with new solutions

136
00:07:26,223 --> 00:07:29,321
in a way that is thinking outside the box.

137
00:07:29,321 --> 00:07:31,624
You might ask yourself,

138
00:07:31,624 --> 00:07:35,737
"Why didn't I come up with the idea
to use a different set of pens?"

139
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:40,087
Because you have been using 
that same pen all day,

140
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:43,061
and that pen has been
rendering its services well.

141
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:45,659
You could be--
you were able to make notes.

142
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:48,991
So cognitive flexibility
has this one component,

143
00:07:48,991 --> 00:07:51,504
you look at the problem
with different sets of tools

144
00:07:51,504 --> 00:07:54,361
with creativity,
you think outside the box.

145
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:57,991
An interesting example 
of cognitive flexibility that comes

146
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,946
from the entrepreneurial space is <i>EndoArt</i>.

147
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:03,579
EndoArt is a company that was created
here, on the Lausanne campus

148
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:06,207
by Nicolas Stergiopulos,
a fellow professor of mine.

149
00:08:06,207 --> 00:08:10,451
And he explained to me 
his company definition

150
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:12,433
and opportunities he saw
in the following way.

151
00:08:12,433 --> 00:08:15,373
He started producing <i>stents.</i>

152
00:08:15,373 --> 00:08:17,835
And <i>stents</i> could be applied in the body,

153
00:08:18,228 --> 00:08:22,099
in particular, to prevent and address
congenital heart disease.

154
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:25,160
But stents could also be applied
elsewhere in the body.

155
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,634
That's how he saw his company.

156
00:08:27,827 --> 00:08:31,085
He basically said,
"Well, stents, its technology,

157
00:08:31,085 --> 00:08:34,394
could be applied across the body
wherever blood flows."

158
00:08:34,394 --> 00:08:38,379
So his definition of the company was
intelligent use of blood flow technology.

159
00:08:38,379 --> 00:08:39,786
And if you think about that,

160
00:08:39,786 --> 00:08:43,337
he could even have zoomed out
one step more, and said,

161
00:08:43,337 --> 00:08:44,882
"OK, it's flow technology.

162
00:08:44,882 --> 00:08:47,358
wherever something flows,
not necessarily blood,

163
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:50,060
we could apply potentially
this technology."

164
00:08:50,175 --> 00:08:52,984
Provided that it renders 
some kind of benefit

165
00:08:54,234 --> 00:08:56,702
relative to competitive offerings
in those spaces.

166
00:08:57,664 --> 00:09:00,455
So if you think about this process
that I just described,

167
00:09:01,078 --> 00:09:05,131
it's a zooming out process 
that is purely cognitive,

168
00:09:05,131 --> 00:09:10,049
i.e. it costs you only cognitive effort, 
but not a real expense up to this point,

169
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,708
which enlarges your view 
of the opportunity space

170
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,944
that may be in front of you.

171
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:19,843
So you come from the specific solution
that addresses congenital heart disease

172
00:09:19,843 --> 00:09:22,758
to other solutions 
that address blood flow,

173
00:09:22,758 --> 00:09:25,048
and then to "Flow Technology".

174
00:09:25,048 --> 00:09:28,969
And I think this is a quite interesting
intellectual exercise for entrepreneurs

175
00:09:28,969 --> 00:09:32,109
that is worth doing
because it exactly helps you

176
00:09:32,109 --> 00:09:36,773
to understand what type
of opportunities are in front of you.

177
00:09:36,947 --> 00:09:38,020
So what can you do?

178
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,596
Based on these insights,
what can you do

179
00:09:39,596 --> 00:09:41,694
to broaden your vision
on the opportunity landscape?

180
00:09:41,694 --> 00:09:43,465
I think it's straightforward now.

181
00:09:43,465 --> 00:09:46,522
First, try to be more alert.

182
00:09:46,522 --> 00:09:49,789
Meaning, when you look out for
opportunities, you see them more easily.

183
00:09:50,515 --> 00:09:52,501
Maybe you try to anticipate the future:

184
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:55,347
how will prices change,
what are the kind of trends you will see?

185
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:59,735
Maybe then you can connect the dots
when you stumble upon an opportunity.

186
00:10:00,361 --> 00:10:02,551
And also ask yourself,
how do you interpret things?

187
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:08,077
Are you more of a "half glass full" person
or the more "the glass half empty" person?

188
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,742
Do you see a problem

189
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:12,067
or do you see an opportunity
to solve that problem?

190
00:10:12,997 --> 00:10:16,718
The second element would be
acquire new insights, new knowledge.

191
00:10:16,718 --> 00:10:20,188
You can read the newspapers,
you can read more broadly

192
00:10:20,188 --> 00:10:24,275
and get a more systematic understanding
of application domains that way.

193
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,542
All that takes some time,

194
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:27,920
so you might want to opt for 
the quick route.

195
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,520
You can systematically scan
industry categories, sectors,

196
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:36,276
SIC codes, industry codes that is,
in order to understand.

197
00:10:36,815 --> 00:10:39,950
Ask yourself, "Can my technology
be applied in those sectors?"

198
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:42,529
"Can my competences 
be applied in those sectors?"

199
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:47,707
For instance, in medical, consumer,
automotive, etc., industry.

200
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:50,244
Or you might turn, 
as we discussed, outside

201
00:10:50,244 --> 00:10:54,629
and say, "OK, if your team have 
diverse knowledge,

202
00:10:54,629 --> 00:10:57,716
make use of that diversity,"
and involve others.

203
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,512
So the question is,
what about crowdsourcing?

204
00:11:00,524 --> 00:11:04,852
And thirdly, you could say, I try
to increase my cognitive flexibility.

205
00:11:04,852 --> 00:11:07,268
You can look at problems 
from multiple angles.

206
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:10,646
You can zoom in and zoom out 
as we have seen with the EndoArt example.

207
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:12,938
So summing up, this hopefully gives you

208
00:11:12,938 --> 00:11:15,648
a number of opportunities
that you could exploit.

209
00:11:15,648 --> 00:11:18,230
Charting the firm growth options

210
00:11:18,230 --> 00:11:21,939
- which is the topic of the next module,
as well as one of the next segments -

211
00:11:22,241 --> 00:11:25,345
is that we identify an opportunity set.

212
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:27,110
You focus on one opportunity

213
00:11:27,110 --> 00:11:30,328
and have a much nicer growth story
for your company

214
00:11:30,328 --> 00:11:32,488
as if you would be the one trick pony

215
00:11:33,131 --> 00:11:35,933
where you exploit 
one market over time only.

216
00:11:36,747 --> 00:11:41,268
So summing up, we have seen
that several factors are instrumental

217
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:44,006
in shaping opportunity 
identification processes.

218
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:46,433
It's the alertness to opportunities,

219
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:49,695
it's your knowledge of markets
of customer needs.

220
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:52,745
It's also cognitive flexibility
to zoom in and out.

221
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:56,364
And coming back to the previous
segment, we've also seen

222
00:11:56,364 --> 00:11:59,411
that the de-linking and re-linking process
is quite essential on that front.

223
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:02,323
Meaning that you have 
certain technologies,

224
00:12:02,323 --> 00:12:05,678
and you try to understand 
what is the scope of these technologies

225
00:12:05,678 --> 00:12:09,006
by asking yourself
what is this technology really doing?

226
00:12:09,006 --> 00:12:11,436
What is general about it,
what is specific about it?

227
00:12:11,436 --> 00:12:13,901
What does this technology do
in its own right

228
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:16,540
decoupled from any market application

229
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,333
that you might have thought of
in the beginning.

230
00:12:19,990 --> 00:12:23,343
So ultimately, if you think about 
these three elements that we discussed,

231
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:26,293
this element shaping the opportunity
identification process,

232
00:12:26,744 --> 00:12:29,906
knowledge, flexibility, alertness,

233
00:12:30,676 --> 00:12:35,196
the de-linking and re-linking process,
and these external knowledge resources

234
00:12:35,196 --> 00:12:38,050
oftentimes, your mind 
is the only limit that you have,

235
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,676
what you can imagine, 
what you can dream about,

236
00:12:40,676 --> 00:12:42,732
what you can think of.

237
00:12:42,732 --> 00:12:46,167
In that sense, I wish you good luck with
your entrepreneurial endeavor for now.

238
00:12:46,167 --> 00:12:50,809
In one of the next segments, we'll talk
about the growth options that you have,

239
00:12:50,809 --> 00:12:54,451
how you select among
multiple market opportunities,

240
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:56,145
and I look forward to seeing you again.
