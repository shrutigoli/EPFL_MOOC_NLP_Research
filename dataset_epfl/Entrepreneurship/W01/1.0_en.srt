Hello, and welcome to our MOOC,
<i>Launching New Ventures.</i>

3
00:00:35,256 --> 00:00:36,894
- I'm Chris.
- And I'm Mark.

4
00:00:36,894 --> 00:00:39,041
We're both professors here at EPFL,

5
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:41,773
the <i>École Polytechnique
Fédérale de Lausanne</i>,

6
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:44,695
which is a hotbed
of entrepreneurship and innovation.

7
00:00:44,695 --> 00:00:47,786
Every month, roughly two
new companies are created here.

8
00:00:47,872 --> 00:00:52,141
EPFL is located in Lausanne in Switzerland
and Switzerland is also a country

9
00:00:52,279 --> 00:00:55,096
where a lot of technology
development happens, you know?

10
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:57,478
We didn't design the course
only for Switzerland.

11
00:00:57,478 --> 00:01:00,282
Quite to the contrary, this course
has a very international scope

12
00:01:00,282 --> 00:01:03,386
so we tried to make it relevant for many,
many countries around the globe.

13
00:01:03,386 --> 00:01:07,636
Yeah, I mean, many MOOCs are designed
with one specific country in mind,

14
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:09,627
whereas what we try to do with this MOOC

15
00:01:09,627 --> 00:01:12,777
is to make it so it's applicable
to many different contexts,

16
00:01:12,777 --> 00:01:15,925
many different regions, including
Africa and other parts of the world.

17
00:01:15,925 --> 00:01:17,881
So, we designed the course
with you in mind

18
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:21,419
drawing on our rich research experience
of more than 30 years combined,

19
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:25,460
as well as our experience
in teaching entrepreneurs

20
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,032
and in consulting with entrepreneurs.

21
00:01:27,032 --> 00:01:29,276
So there's lots of experience to draw from

22
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:33,068
and we use that in order to craft a MOOC
that is compelling to you.

23
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:37,310
We know that for many people
entrepreneurship is a life-changing event

24
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,522
so maybe this MOOC will change your life

25
00:01:39,522 --> 00:01:41,967
and lead you to some greener pastures.

26
00:01:41,967 --> 00:01:43,697
Now, what we've done with this MOOC

27
00:01:43,697 --> 00:01:46,175
is we've followed
a long entrepreneurial process.

28
00:01:46,175 --> 00:01:49,513
The MOOC itself is only going to be
five weeks long, total.

29
00:01:49,513 --> 00:01:50,586
What we've done

30
00:01:50,586 --> 00:01:53,123
is we've picked the subjects
that are absolutely critical,

31
00:01:53,123 --> 00:01:56,007
the most specific things
that you need to launch your business.

32
00:01:56,007 --> 00:01:59,151
So we think this is going to be
both fun and educational.

33
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:00,691
- Surely fun!
- Exactly.

34
00:02:00,691 --> 00:02:02,432
So without further ado, let's get going,

35
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,941
and let's look at what
entrepreneurship actually means.

36
00:02:04,941 --> 00:02:06,837
Yes, what is entrepreneurship?

37
00:02:06,837 --> 00:02:08,640
Well, one definition of entrepreneurship

38
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,250
is it's bringing resources
together to create value.

39
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,806
What type of value?

40
00:02:13,806 --> 00:02:15,211
It could be any kind of value.

41
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:21,164
It could be economic value, social value,
there's eco-entrepreneurship,

42
00:02:21,164 --> 00:02:24,093
social entrepreneurship,
there's lots of different things,

43
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:26,561
but what we're going
to focus on in this MOOC

44
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:30,771
is going to be on the economic
value creation for the growth ventures,

45
00:02:30,771 --> 00:02:33,119
although, the other things
will probably fall into place

46
00:02:33,119 --> 00:02:35,463
once you have
a viable business proposition.

47
00:02:35,776 --> 00:02:38,435
Exactly, so this word
<i>entrepreneurship</i> actually comes from

48
00:02:38,435 --> 00:02:39,956
a French term, <i>entreprendre</i>,

49
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:42,812
and if you thought entrepreneurship
was something cool and new,

50
00:02:42,812 --> 00:02:45,065
here's the bad news
right at the beginning of the MOOC.

51
00:02:45,065 --> 00:02:47,956
It's actually a term that was used
since the 17th century,

52
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:51,910
and there was one person,
a scientist, Richard Cantillon,

53
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:55,281
[who] used that for a term
in the 17th century for the first time.

54
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,949
So what did he observe?

55
00:02:56,949 --> 00:02:58,880
He actually observed
people like Marco Polo,

56
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:01,633
and contrasted them
with how business activity was done

57
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,908
in the ancient marketplaces at the time.

58
00:03:04,105 --> 00:03:06,747
So Marco Polo, he was
a merchant-adventurer.

59
00:03:06,747 --> 00:03:09,957
He traveled to the Far East,
he bought silk, he bought tea,

60
00:03:10,271 --> 00:03:13,354
and he brought the stuff back
to the marketplaces here in Europe.

61
00:03:13,354 --> 00:03:15,471
And to think about
the marketplace in those days,

62
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:16,825
what did they sell?

63
00:03:16,825 --> 00:03:21,307
Local businesses, butchers,
and carpenters, farmers' markets, etc.

64
00:03:21,435 --> 00:03:24,232
where people congregated
in one public space.

65
00:03:24,232 --> 00:03:27,059
So now, imagine Marco Polo
being in one of these marketplaces

66
00:03:27,059 --> 00:03:30,693
and saying, "I have silk for you,
I have tea for you."

67
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:33,094
The customers wouldn't know
these types of products,

68
00:03:33,094 --> 00:03:36,252
so it wasn't innovation
that Marco Polo brought about,

69
00:03:36,252 --> 00:03:39,497
but it was risky because he had
expenditures when he was in India.

70
00:03:39,497 --> 00:03:42,672
Quite a lot of expenditures before
he was able to get a return on his--

71
00:03:42,896 --> 00:03:45,206
Not knowing exactly what
he would get in return, yeah?

72
00:03:45,402 --> 00:03:47,404
So that has traces
of entrepreneurship there,

73
00:03:47,404 --> 00:03:49,258
doing something innovative,

74
00:03:49,258 --> 00:03:53,046
but on the other hand, he did also
not finance his travels by himself.

75
00:03:53,046 --> 00:03:54,449
What Marco Polo actually did

76
00:03:54,449 --> 00:03:58,473
[was] he found capitalists who financed
his travels to the Far East,

77
00:03:58,473 --> 00:04:00,886
and when he was in the Far East,
he brought the goods back,

78
00:04:00,886 --> 00:04:02,882
and when he sold them off at a profit,

79
00:04:02,882 --> 00:04:05,894
he shared the profits
with these capitalists.

80
00:04:05,894 --> 00:04:08,569
75% would go into
the pocket of the capitalists,

81
00:04:08,569 --> 00:04:11,495
and 25% would be going
into Marco Polo's pocket.

82
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:14,956
And that sounds awfully familiar
to what we see nowadays in venture capital

83
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:17,561
so there are also traces here
of entrepreneurship.

84
00:04:17,561 --> 00:04:18,904
So in essence, I think

85
00:04:18,904 --> 00:04:23,153
these early observations shaped the field
of entrepreneurship quite a bit

86
00:04:23,153 --> 00:04:28,102
and entrepreneurial behavior as such
is actually rooted in many of us here.

87
00:04:28,102 --> 00:04:31,474
It's not something special in that sense.

88
00:04:31,474 --> 00:04:34,535
It's quite conventional
that we see entrepreneurship,

89
00:04:34,535 --> 00:04:36,487
because if you think back
into the ancient times,

90
00:04:36,487 --> 00:04:37,859
everyone was an entrepreneur.

91
00:04:37,859 --> 00:04:40,507
There were no large organizations
or public organizations,

92
00:04:40,507 --> 00:04:42,301
governments to work for.

93
00:04:42,301 --> 00:04:43,799
Everyone had to find ways

94
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:47,370
to trade, and to produce something,
and to sell something.

95
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:49,776
So, entrepreneurship as such
is everywhere,

96
00:04:49,776 --> 00:04:54,204
and I think it's time that you discover
whether you might be a good entrepreneur.

97
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:58,810
So, according to this Cantillon example,
you could think about Marco Polo

98
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:03,397
as a great case of someone
who had an <i>Entrepreneurial Mindset</i>.

99
00:05:03,397 --> 00:05:05,099
He was an entrepreneurial thinker

100
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:09,976
who had gone through several
<i>entrepreneurial events</i> or milestones,

101
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:13,677
and who was someone who participated
in a whole <i>entrepreneurial process</i>.

102
00:05:13,677 --> 00:05:16,629
This is kind of the three ways
of thinking about entrepreneurship

103
00:05:17,048 --> 00:05:19,713
and we're going to discuss each of those.

104
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:22,223
First, we're going to think
about the kinds of people

105
00:05:22,223 --> 00:05:25,304
who would be entrepreneurial minded.

106
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:27,807
This could be anywhere;
it could be a founder of a company,

107
00:05:27,807 --> 00:05:30,279
or someone in a big company
having an entrepreneurial mindset,

108
00:05:30,279 --> 00:05:32,371
somebody who wants to take risk.

109
00:05:32,371 --> 00:05:35,106
In a way, by looking
at the content of our MOOC

110
00:05:35,106 --> 00:05:37,837
you can see, what are the components
of an entrepreneurial mindset,

111
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:41,139
and how may I nurture, as a person,
my entrepreneurial mindset.

112
00:05:41,139 --> 00:05:42,935
Right, and then, what we'll do

113
00:05:42,935 --> 00:05:47,643
is we'll think a little bit about
the entrepreneurial events or milestones

114
00:05:47,643 --> 00:05:51,808
that happened during the course
of the entrepreneurial process,

115
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:56,726
and then we're also mainly organized,
this MOOC, around point #3,

116
00:05:56,726 --> 00:05:59,612
which is the entrepreneurial
process itself.

117
00:05:59,612 --> 00:06:02,067
So we have a pre-launch phase
and a post-launch phase,

118
00:06:02,067 --> 00:06:04,368
In the pre-launch phase
we look at the content,

119
00:06:04,368 --> 00:06:06,205
for instance,
like opportunity identification;

120
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:08,233
in the post-launch phase
we look at growth,

121
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:11,114
about making your sales,
entrepreneurial marketing, etc.

122
00:06:11,114 --> 00:06:14,261
Exactly, so all of this stuff
will be organized

123
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:18,086
around the entrepreneurial process
as a timeline, in that sense.

124
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,753
You may ask yourself,
is entrepreneurship actually for me?

125
00:06:20,753 --> 00:06:23,963
You might think, "Maybe I'm too old,
maybe I'm too young,

126
00:06:23,963 --> 00:06:26,868
maybe I'm living in a region where
entrepreneurship is not so prevalent,"

127
00:06:26,868 --> 00:06:30,113
but here are two statistics
that are quite important.

128
00:06:30,113 --> 00:06:32,189
We don't want to bore you here
with lots of studies,

129
00:06:32,189 --> 00:06:34,602
but these are two interesting tidbits
that you want to know.

130
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,428
First, look at this slide here.

131
00:06:36,428 --> 00:06:39,449
It shows you the distribution
of entrepreneurship

132
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:41,894
across different age groups,
across different regions.

133
00:06:41,894 --> 00:06:45,389
I think the main takeaway is 
that entrepreneurship is everywhere.

134
00:06:45,389 --> 00:06:47,257
You see it across the globe,

135
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:50,849
and what's quite amazing is lots
of entrepreneurship, actually, in Africa.

136
00:06:50,849 --> 00:06:53,644
In other countries, US, of course,

137
00:06:53,696 --> 00:06:56,443
that's typically considered
as an entrepreneurial country,

138
00:06:56,443 --> 00:06:58,505
but also here in Europe,
and in other countries.

139
00:06:58,505 --> 00:07:00,872
That's quite an important takeaway.

140
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:03,807
The second takeaway
is here on the next slide.

141
00:07:03,807 --> 00:07:06,575
Right, so if you look at this slide,
I think what strikes you

142
00:07:06,575 --> 00:07:11,609
is that yes, there's slightly more men
than women in entrepreneurship worldwide.

143
00:07:11,609 --> 00:07:15,721
However, it's really quite well
distributed between men and women,

144
00:07:15,721 --> 00:07:18,551
almost equal,
across all parts of the globe.

145
00:07:18,551 --> 00:07:22,327
So it's not a male dominated area.
It's very democratic in that sense.

146
00:07:22,327 --> 00:07:23,948
If you look at the larger corporations,

147
00:07:23,948 --> 00:07:26,254
we are still discussing
that there is gender equality,

148
00:07:26,254 --> 00:07:28,923
but look at this: here
we have gender equality.

149
00:07:28,923 --> 00:07:31,871
Also, you've got the different
regions of the world, too.

150
00:07:32,068 --> 00:07:35,759
Most people think about North America
as being the place for entrepreneurship,

151
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,586
but if you look at these graphics,
I think you'll see that really,

152
00:07:38,586 --> 00:07:41,167
it's happening everywhere,
and even to some extent,

153
00:07:41,167 --> 00:07:42,901
more than in North America.

154
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:45,439
That's why I want to reiterate
what we said before:

155
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:48,588
this is a course that is really
targeted at global audiences

156
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:50,675
and not just a specific country
or specific regions.

157
00:07:50,675 --> 00:07:54,779
This is targeted to males, to females,
to people in Asia, in Africa,

158
00:07:54,779 --> 00:07:56,650
to all people around the globe, in a way.

159
00:07:57,386 --> 00:08:00,800
So in this MOOC,
we're going to have an emphasis

160
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,750
on the technology-driven
entrepreneurship businesses.

161
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,850
If you think about
technology-driven entrepreneurship

162
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:08,406
it's about having
an innovative technology,

163
00:08:08,406 --> 00:08:11,816
trying to commercialize it,
it's like the Marco Polo example.

164
00:08:11,816 --> 00:08:13,742
You're doing something
innovative to the market,

165
00:08:13,742 --> 00:08:14,928
customers might not know it,

166
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:17,118
so there are some unique challenges
that you are facing

167
00:08:17,118 --> 00:08:19,593
when you are trying to create
this type of venture,

168
00:08:19,593 --> 00:08:21,199
a technology-driven one.

169
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,321
In contrast, there's the more
self-employed entrepreneurship

170
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:26,438
where you are imitating.

171
00:08:26,438 --> 00:08:30,358
It could be that - this is still relevant
for self-employment businesses -

172
00:08:30,358 --> 00:08:32,930
in a self-employment type situation,

173
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:35,726
you need usually more
of an imitation type business,

174
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:38,775
usually made for a lifestyle
without a big, big growth option

175
00:08:38,775 --> 00:08:43,083
- the material in this course
will also be relevant to those people too-

176
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:46,592
but we will place more of an emphasis
on the growth aspects of this.

177
00:08:46,592 --> 00:08:49,830
So, where are these technology-driven
companies coming from?

178
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:53,750
These technologies are oftentimes
developed at universities,

179
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:56,500
so they might be coming
from technology transfer offices,

180
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,202
they might also be coming
from larger corporations

181
00:08:59,229 --> 00:09:01,776
where some employees might say,
"We have a cool new technology,

182
00:09:01,776 --> 00:09:07,493
"our headquarters are not interested
in commercializing this business,

183
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:09,802
so we do it, we form a group,

184
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:13,045
and we spin out a company
from the larger corporation."

185
00:09:13,338 --> 00:09:18,897
Or it could be individual inventors
making things in their mythical garages.

186
00:09:18,897 --> 00:09:20,702
Exactly, and that doesn't
have to be a garage,

187
00:09:20,702 --> 00:09:23,423
could also be a basement, but that's
typically where they start off.

188
00:09:23,423 --> 00:09:24,721
We always talk about the garage.

189
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:28,111
They say that they don't have the funds
to hire fancy office buildings,

190
00:09:28,368 --> 00:09:32,481
so there are lots of origins,
and there might be different ones,

191
00:09:32,481 --> 00:09:34,469
so we don't want
to exclude the other ones,

192
00:09:34,469 --> 00:09:38,246
but these are three conventional ones,
three ones that are often encountered.

193
00:09:38,461 --> 00:09:40,036
So as I mentioned before,

194
00:09:40,036 --> 00:09:43,374
this course is structured
around the entrepreneurial process.

195
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:46,048
So what we'll do is in the next segment

196
00:09:46,048 --> 00:09:49,961
we'll go through a lot of the details
about how the course is structured,

197
00:09:49,961 --> 00:09:54,652
and what to expect over
the next five weeks, so stay with us.

198
00:09:54,652 --> 00:09:55,998
- Yes!
