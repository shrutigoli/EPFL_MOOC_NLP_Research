1
00:00:04,251 --> 00:00:05,787
In the previous section,

2
00:00:05,787 --> 00:00:08,496
I introduced the principle
of slice selection

3
00:00:08,496 --> 00:00:11,175
and frequency encoding
with gradient switching,

4
00:00:11,175 --> 00:00:17,148
and I said, this is almost the essential--
the basic imaging sequence.

5
00:00:17,148 --> 00:00:19,118
What I haven't told you is,

6
00:00:19,118 --> 00:00:22,928
how do we get
the second spatial dimension encoded?

7
00:00:23,739 --> 00:00:25,271
<i>So, let's recap what we've seen.</i>

8
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:28,376
<i>We have had an RF pulse,
that flips the magnetization</i>

9
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:30,629
<i>to transfer spin by α degrees.</i>

10
00:00:30,629 --> 00:00:33,312
<i>We have the slice select gradient
with the rephase.</i>

11
00:00:33,312 --> 00:00:34,934
<i>I will not comment on here.</i>

12
00:00:34,934 --> 00:00:38,595
<i>The frequency encode,
with echo formation.</i>

13
00:00:38,595 --> 00:00:41,945
<i>This is the condition of zero integral
for the gradient,</i>

14
00:00:41,945 --> 00:00:44,484
<i>so this defines the echo time, TE.</i>

15
00:00:45,007 --> 00:00:47,015
<i>This is the signal that is produced.</i>

16
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,606
<i>The data sampling is done
over this time period,</i>

17
00:00:49,606 --> 00:00:54,684
<i>and this is what is the sample signal
that arrives in our computer.</i>

18
00:00:55,406 --> 00:01:00,216
<i>Now, what we see here is
that this produces us a slice selection--</i>

19
00:01:00,922 --> 00:01:02,519
<i>that's what this does--</i>

20
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:06,372
<i>and an encoding of a projection,
in one direction.</i>

21
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:08,627
<i>But where's the second dimension?</i>

22
00:01:09,472 --> 00:01:10,951
<i>So, for the second dimension,</i>

23
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:15,281
<i>we turn on the phase encode gradient
here along Y.</i>

24
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:17,671
<i>We just turn on the gradient
at this position</i>

25
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:21,222
<i>for a certain amount of time,
with a certain amplitude.</i>

26
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:26,163
<i>And this is now the entire experiment.</i>

27
00:01:26,163 --> 00:01:28,462
<i>However, this gradient is applied--</i>

28
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:31,492
<i>this phase encode gradient
is applied with a certain amplitude.</i>

29
00:01:31,492 --> 00:01:34,053
<i>That does not give us spatial information.</i>

30
00:01:34,053 --> 00:01:36,732
<i>So, this is repeated,
with a changed amplitude.</i>

31
00:01:36,732 --> 00:01:41,780
<i>So, here, reduced
by an amount ΔGz. Uh, Gy.</i>

32
00:01:42,472 --> 00:01:44,143
<i>And we repeat it again.</i>

33
00:01:44,143 --> 00:01:47,794
<i>We'll repeat it every TR seconds,
that's the repetition time.</i>

34
00:01:47,794 --> 00:01:51,946
<i>We increment or decrement by ΔGy,
and so forth.</i>

35
00:01:51,946 --> 00:01:55,965
<i>We go through zero, we go
into the negative values, and so forth,</i>

36
00:01:55,965 --> 00:02:01,263
<i>until we have scanned the number
of phase encode steps that we want.</i>

37
00:02:02,402 --> 00:02:06,314
<i>So, what we have here now
is three gradients.</i>

38
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:09,489
<i>The slice selection gradient,
perpendicular read gradient,</i>

39
00:02:09,489 --> 00:02:12,636
<i>and the phase encode
is perpendicular to both slice and read.</i>

40
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:16,316
<i>This gives us a Cartesian encoding
of the signal.</i>

41
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:21,614
<i>So, we are distinguishing three phases
of the imaging sequence.</i>

42
00:02:21,614 --> 00:02:24,554
<i>We have-- first part is excitation.</i>

43
00:02:24,554 --> 00:02:27,555
<i>Since all the spatial manipulations,
the spatial encoding,</i>

44
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:29,285
<i>is done on the transverse plane,</i>

45
00:02:29,285 --> 00:02:32,395
<i>we need to get the magnetization
into the transverse plane.</i>

46
00:02:32,395 --> 00:02:36,784
<i>During excitation, typically there is
slice selection that's being done.</i>

47
00:02:37,775 --> 00:02:39,606
<i>The next phase is phase encoding,</i>

48
00:02:39,606 --> 00:02:42,575
<i>so that is the encoding
of the second dimension,</i>

49
00:02:42,575 --> 00:02:47,034
<i>and then we have frequency encoding
and echo formation,</i>

50
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:50,815
<i>that is the encoding
of the first spatial dimension.</i>

51
00:02:50,815 --> 00:02:55,465
<i>So, we have slice selection,
frequency encoding, and phase encoding.</i>

52
00:02:55,465 --> 00:02:58,520
<i>All this together,
repeated every TR seconds,</i>

53
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:03,736
<i>with the phase encode gradient
changing after every RF pulse--</i>

54
00:03:03,736 --> 00:03:07,866
<i>this gives us the information
to generate an image.</i>

55
00:03:09,766 --> 00:03:13,706
<i>Now, to understand
how this phase encode gradient</i>

56
00:03:13,706 --> 00:03:17,516
<i>produces the information
that allows us to reconstruct an image</i>

57
00:03:17,516 --> 00:03:22,497
<i>is not trivial, and I'm going to try,
in the next following slides--</i>

58
00:03:22,497 --> 00:03:24,211
<i>try to explain this.</i>

59
00:03:24,211 --> 00:03:28,257
<i>It is difficult to understand
how this phase encoding gradient allows</i>

60
00:03:28,257 --> 00:03:31,856
<i>to encode the second spatial dimension.</i>

61
00:03:33,307 --> 00:03:36,333
<i>So, and that's exactly the question
we're going to look at now.</i>

62
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:40,632
<i>So, let's say we have
a two-dimensional object, along X and Y.</i>

63
00:03:40,632 --> 00:03:43,761
<i>We're looking at the voxel magnetization--</i>

64
00:03:43,761 --> 00:03:47,641
<i>the transverse voxel magnetization
in our two-dimensional object.</i>

65
00:03:47,641 --> 00:03:50,261
<i>It's a seven by seven object, here.</i>

66
00:03:50,972 --> 00:03:55,181
<i>Now, if we do apply
a phase encode gradient along Y,</i>

67
00:03:55,181 --> 00:04:00,712
<i>then we apply it for a certain duration,
with a certain amplitude,</i>

68
00:04:00,712 --> 00:04:04,072
<i>then we have-- along Y,
we have phases that change.</i>

69
00:04:04,072 --> 00:04:05,763
<i>For all the positions along X,</i>

70
00:04:05,763 --> 00:04:09,073
<i>they have the same position,
so they have the same phase,</i>

71
00:04:09,073 --> 00:04:12,532
<i>but along Y, it depends
on their position in Y.</i>

72
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:15,773
<i>These guys have not changed,
the others have changed.</i>

73
00:04:15,773 --> 00:04:21,413
<i>These turned to the right,
and these turned to the left, below.</i>

74
00:04:22,412 --> 00:04:26,042
<i>Now, we'll repeat this
with twice the gradient strength.</i>

75
00:04:26,042 --> 00:04:27,902
<i>So, this means that,</i>

76
00:04:27,902 --> 00:04:30,834
<i>if we repeat this experiment
with twice the gradient strength,</i>

77
00:04:30,834 --> 00:04:37,544
<i>for each of the positions,
the vector moves by twice the angle.</i>

78
00:04:39,753 --> 00:04:43,358
<i>Now we'll say
we have applied this gradient for time τ,</i>

79
00:04:44,553 --> 00:04:49,648
<i>and we'll express this
in imaginary and real compositions,</i>

80
00:04:50,318 --> 00:04:51,755
<i>in the complex plane.</i>

81
00:04:51,755 --> 00:04:55,404
<i>So, we'll say, the X magnetization is...</i>

82
00:04:56,204 --> 00:05:00,114
<i>real, and the Y magnetization
is imaginary.</i>

83
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:02,504
<i>These X and Ys,
that's in magnetization space.</i>

84
00:05:02,504 --> 00:05:05,775
<i>This is the real space
that pertains to here.</i>

85
00:05:05,775 --> 00:05:09,194
<i>So, if we look at a given voxel,
then its position--</i>

86
00:05:10,573 --> 00:05:13,707
<i>its phase is given
by the position along Y,</i>

87
00:05:13,707 --> 00:05:17,066
<i>the duration τ, and the gradient Gy.</i>

88
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:20,295
<i>So, the phase here
is given by this term here.</i>

89
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:21,652
<i>That's what's happened</i>

90
00:05:21,652 --> 00:05:24,921
<i>after applying this gradient Gy
for a duration τ.</i>

91
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:29,516
<i>Now, after we have applied
this phase encode gradient,</i>

92
00:05:29,516 --> 00:05:34,776
<i>Gy for τ seconds,
we have this phase term here.</i>

93
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:37,154
<i>I'll re-write this here.</i>

94
00:05:37,154 --> 00:05:39,835
<i>This is the situation that we have.</i>

95
00:05:39,835 --> 00:05:41,745
<i>And now, we want to look at what happens</i>

96
00:05:41,745 --> 00:05:44,887
<i>during the application
of the read-out gradient.</i>

97
00:05:44,887 --> 00:05:47,501
<i>And here, we're not going to deal
with the complexities</i>

98
00:05:47,501 --> 00:05:49,335
<i>of the need to generate an echo;</i>

99
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:53,654
<i>we'll just start at what's happening
at the time of the echo.</i>

100
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,126
<i>So, at the time of echo,</i>

101
00:05:55,126 --> 00:05:59,517
<i>we will start with a phase evolution
that's determined now--</i>

102
00:05:59,517 --> 00:06:02,137
<i>because it's under the influence
of an X gradient,</i>

103
00:06:02,137 --> 00:06:04,515
<i>that's determined by the magnitude
of the gradient,</i>

104
00:06:04,515 --> 00:06:06,670
<i>the position, and the time variable τ.</i>

105
00:06:07,257 --> 00:06:12,956
<i>So, I'll plot this,
and as the gradient is turned on along X,</i>

106
00:06:12,956 --> 00:06:17,056
<i>then we will see, now,
that the magnetizations along Y...</i>

107
00:06:19,898 --> 00:06:23,528
<i>they have the same
precessional frequency here,</i>

108
00:06:23,528 --> 00:06:26,128
<i>but along X, their precessional frequency
is different.</i>

109
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:30,141
<i>These turn clockwise,
these turn counterclockwise,</i>

110
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:32,383
<i>and here, on the resonance,
they don't move.</i>

111
00:06:32,383 --> 00:06:36,071
<i>They just have the phase difference
that was induced by the Y gradient.</i>

112
00:06:38,956 --> 00:06:41,447
<i>So, clearly, if we now
Fourier transform this signal,</i>

113
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:43,128
<i>this is what we are observing here,</i>

114
00:06:43,128 --> 00:06:48,950
<i>we will get the different frequencies
as a function of X position.</i>

115
00:06:50,218 --> 00:06:53,759
<i>We'll now take these two terms here,
and we'll re-write them,</i>

116
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,177
<i>and we'll re-write them</i>

117
00:06:55,177 --> 00:06:57,699
<i>such that we introduce
the variables Kx, Ky here,</i>

118
00:06:57,699 --> 00:07:02,248
<i>the Fourier pair variables
to X and Y, to the position.</i>

119
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:09,080
<i>So, this we can write
as e ^ (Kx ∙ x + Ky ∙ y) ∙ i.</i>

120
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,973
<i>That's the... re-writing here,</i>

121
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:17,999
<i>we have used here the definition
for the K space vector in this case.</i>

122
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:24,321
<i>So, that's the phase
of our voxel magnetization,</i>

123
00:07:24,321 --> 00:07:28,269
<i>and that we have
for a position X and Y that is given.</i>

124
00:07:29,869 --> 00:07:35,390
Ok, so we have seen that applying
a gradient for a short time along Y,

125
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:37,909
in the phase encode direction,
produces a phase twist

126
00:07:37,909 --> 00:07:40,967
according to the position in Y.

127
00:07:40,967 --> 00:07:43,393
And then, applying the gradient along X

128
00:07:43,393 --> 00:07:46,369
induces precessional frequencies
that are being recorded,

129
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:48,769
that depend on the position in Y.

130
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,970
And now, how can we understand

131
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:54,973
how this generates the necessary
information for image reconstruction?

132
00:07:54,973 --> 00:07:56,576
What we're now going to do is,

133
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:01,165
we're going to look at the phase
of a single pixel in the X-Y plane.

134
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:06,323
Ok, we'll say we'll take
the magnetization phase of a single pixel,

135
00:08:07,085 --> 00:08:10,822
at a given position-- you can consider it
a pointwise object,

136
00:08:10,822 --> 00:08:12,765
a capillary or something--

137
00:08:12,765 --> 00:08:16,365
just a pointwise object,
idealized, with no dimensions.

138
00:08:16,365 --> 00:08:18,824
We'll just take a single pixel.

139
00:08:19,815 --> 00:08:22,875
And we'll plot,
on the horizontal axis here,

140
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,305
we will plot the time.

141
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:30,510
During that time, we have the readout,
that is the gradient Gx is on,

142
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:36,036
so we have Gx ∙ T, is the phase,
dependent on Gx ∙ T.

143
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,629
So, we'll start out here.

144
00:08:39,629 --> 00:08:42,488
We apply the gradient
along X, and we will have,

145
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:44,950
over time, as we apply the gradient,

146
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:50,587
we have the phase of our magnetization
that changes with time.

147
00:08:50,587 --> 00:08:52,769
This is simple precession.

148
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:56,230
The phase increments,
for this particular voxel--

149
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,450
remember, we're just looking
at one single voxel,

150
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:04,929
one single pixel in space.
We're just considering that case.

151
00:09:04,929 --> 00:09:07,827
And so, now, we have the evolution
of the phase with time.

152
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:10,250
That's basically our representation of...

153
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:13,990
precession.

154
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:16,710
So, we can say we are digitizing,
here, seven time points.

155
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:18,939
We're looking at seven time points.

156
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:23,130
Now, we'll do step one.
We will apply gradient along Y.

157
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:27,769
That gradient will induce a phase twist,
according to the position of the voxel.

158
00:09:27,769 --> 00:09:33,047
So, after having applied this gradient,
the magnetization of our voxel

159
00:09:33,047 --> 00:09:36,681
starts out at this position,

160
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:41,100
and now, during the time
where we apply the X gradient,

161
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:44,881
there is the same phase twist
that's applied on the magnetization

162
00:09:44,881 --> 00:09:48,380
of our voxel, of our pixel,
that's happening.

163
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,990
So, the relative phase of this,
relative to this, is the relative phase...

164
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:58,112
of this to this, but this twist here
is due to the position in Y,

165
00:09:58,112 --> 00:10:00,344
to the application
of the gradient along Y.

166
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,353
We'll do the next step.

167
00:10:02,353 --> 00:10:05,013
So, we have twice
the gradient amplitude along Y.

168
00:10:05,013 --> 00:10:09,003
So, the phase
is twice as big here, to start with.

169
00:10:09,003 --> 00:10:11,363
We'll just draw
the seven time points along X,

170
00:10:11,363 --> 00:10:13,503
and as we apply the gradient along X,

171
00:10:13,503 --> 00:10:19,032
then the magnetization
develops along X, as we see here.

172
00:10:19,913 --> 00:10:26,053
We'll do the third step, and we'll have
a phase evolution during the Y gradient.

173
00:10:26,784 --> 00:10:29,130
Now, for each of the end steps,

174
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:32,879
the gradient that's applied here
is proportional to ΔGy,

175
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:35,293
so it increases...

176
00:10:36,998 --> 00:10:38,960
linearly with time.

177
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,671
If we go in the opposite direction,

178
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:44,129
we'll have the starting phase
of the magnetization

179
00:10:44,129 --> 00:10:47,508
in the opposite direction,
twice the opposite direction,

180
00:10:47,508 --> 00:10:50,806
and three times the opposite direction,

181
00:10:50,806 --> 00:10:56,019
again with the phase being twisted
by the readout gradient.

182
00:10:56,019 --> 00:11:00,486
So, here we have no evolution along X,

183
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:03,077
so we see the starting phase
of the magnetization

184
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:06,557
for each of the gradient
applications along Y.

185
00:11:06,557 --> 00:11:08,816
Here was no gradient application along Y.

186
00:11:08,816 --> 00:11:12,477
Here, we have the pure effect
of the X gradient.

187
00:11:14,346 --> 00:11:18,146
Now, the question here is,

188
00:11:18,146 --> 00:11:23,156
does the computer that will digitize
this seven-by-seven matrix here--

189
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:25,974
will the computer
be able to distinguish...

190
00:11:28,371 --> 00:11:32,541
whether these seven points
have been recorded sequentially,

191
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,682
or these seven points
have been recorded sequentially?

192
00:11:36,632 --> 00:11:40,132
Look at the magnetization vector here,
and the magnetization vector here,

193
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,332
and you will see that those...

194
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:47,392
this particular column
and this particular row, they are--

195
00:11:47,392 --> 00:11:51,652
in terms of magnetization vector,
they are indistinguishable.

196
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:56,463
We cannot distinguish their positions.

197
00:11:58,973 --> 00:12:02,604
So, from a standpoint of computer--
the computer is a stupid machine.

198
00:12:03,243 --> 00:12:05,953
At least, those computers
that we are talking about here.

199
00:12:05,953 --> 00:12:07,954
It does not know
how the data was acquired.

200
00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:09,622
It just gets the data.

201
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:11,584
If it now examines this data set,

202
00:12:11,584 --> 00:12:15,084
it will not be able to say
from this seven-by-seven matrix,

203
00:12:15,084 --> 00:12:19,283
we've been encoding
these seven time points sequentially,

204
00:12:19,283 --> 00:12:22,454
or we've been encoding
these seven time points sequentially.

205
00:12:22,454 --> 00:12:27,884
So, in essence, when you store the data
in the computer in this fashion,

206
00:12:30,323 --> 00:12:33,822
then the way the data is stored is,

207
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:38,412
the role of phase encode
and readout gradient are interchangeable.

208
00:12:38,412 --> 00:12:40,863
They can no longer be distinguished.

209
00:12:40,863 --> 00:12:47,693
And so, the phase encoding amounts,
essentially, to frequency encoding,

210
00:12:47,693 --> 00:12:51,712
which is what we're doing
in the X direction, in the same way.

211
00:12:51,712 --> 00:12:54,542
<i>Now, this comes
from the simple fact that,</i>

212
00:12:54,542 --> 00:12:58,273
<i>if we have a change in phase
with time, like here,</i>

213
00:12:58,273 --> 00:13:02,162
<i>this corresponds to a precessional
frequency that we have seen.</i>

214
00:13:02,162 --> 00:13:05,303
<i>That's very simple, but if we now
introduce the second dimension,</i>

215
00:13:05,303 --> 00:13:08,638
<i>also a time component,
then this phase evolution here</i>

216
00:13:08,638 --> 00:13:13,857
<i>will also correspond to a frequency--
a precessional frequency.</i>

217
00:13:13,857 --> 00:13:18,198
<i>Except that it's not real time,
it is the time variable introduced</i>

218
00:13:18,198 --> 00:13:21,227
<i>by phase encode steps
one, two, three, et cetera.</i>

219
00:13:22,238 --> 00:13:25,539
<i>So, if we look at the signal
of the voxel we have here,</i>

220
00:13:26,922 --> 00:13:31,637
<i>we can attribute this to a time ΔT,</i>

221
00:13:31,637 --> 00:13:34,922
<i>so we can introduce, along Y,
a second time component.</i>

222
00:13:36,862 --> 00:13:38,673
<i>Or, in general, our signal is given</i>

223
00:13:38,673 --> 00:13:43,233
<i>by the nth gradient,
phase encode gradient N,</i>

224
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:45,324
<i>the increment
of the phase encode gradient,</i>

225
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,914
<i>ΔGy, which is constant--</i>

226
00:13:46,914 --> 00:13:49,464
<i>this is proportional
to the transverse magnetization</i>

227
00:13:49,464 --> 00:13:52,393
<i>at the beginning, at the position X and Y.</i>

228
00:13:52,393 --> 00:13:54,834
<i>That's this particular XY.</i>

229
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,094
<i>This is the effect
of the phase encode gradient,</i>

230
00:13:57,094 --> 00:14:01,599
<i>so it's γ ∙ N ∙ ΔGy, is this amplitude Gy,</i>

231
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:06,184
<i>and e ^ (i ∙ γ ∙ Gx ∙ X ∙ T),</i>

232
00:14:06,184 --> 00:14:08,673
<i>that's the evolution
during the readout gradient.</i>

233
00:14:08,673 --> 00:14:13,614
<i>Again, here we have not considered
echo formation.</i>

234
00:14:13,614 --> 00:14:15,874
<i>We are assuming
that we're starting at the echo.</i>

235
00:14:15,874 --> 00:14:21,644
<i>The principle here
is more important than exact detail.</i>

236
00:14:22,994 --> 00:14:26,114
<i>So, this is our signal
of the individual voxel.</i>

237
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:31,695
<i>Now, we'll introduce the definition
of two variables, Kx-- that's γ ∙ Gx ∙ T,</i>

238
00:14:32,665 --> 00:14:35,946
<i>and Ky, which is γ ∙ Gy ∙ τ.</i>

239
00:14:36,695 --> 00:14:41,555
<i>These are the phases-- the phase terms, 
proportional to the phase terms.</i>

240
00:14:41,555 --> 00:14:43,275
<i>With these definitions,</i>

241
00:14:43,275 --> 00:14:47,239
<i>we can rewrite our signal
as a function of Kx and Ky.</i>

242
00:14:47,239 --> 00:14:49,858
<i>We have the transverse magnetization,
that's this term,</i>

243
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:51,775
<i>and now the phase term here changes,</i>

244
00:14:51,775 --> 00:14:58,550
<i>and you can verify
this gives us the (Kx ∙ X + Ky ∙ Y) ∙ i.</i>

245
00:15:00,035 --> 00:15:04,975
<i>That's our signal of our voxel
with the transformation of the variables.</i>

246
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:08,015
<i>Here, this is what we relate
to the experiment.</i>

247
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:12,206
<i>These are mathematical
variable transformations.</i>

248
00:15:12,815 --> 00:15:15,466
<i>Ok, so far this is the signal
for a single pixel.</i>

249
00:15:15,466 --> 00:15:16,945
<i>Pointwise object.</i>

250
00:15:16,945 --> 00:15:20,116
<i>How about the signal for an entire object?</i>

251
00:15:20,116 --> 00:15:22,956
<i>Well, we're going to have to integrate
along X and Y,</i>

252
00:15:22,956 --> 00:15:27,556
<i>so we'll do a two-dimensional integral
across our object, in X and Y.</i>

253
00:15:27,556 --> 00:15:32,480
<i>Our signal along the Kx, Ky is given by--</i>

254
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,629
<i>is proportional to the transverse
magnetization at that position,</i>

255
00:15:35,629 --> 00:15:40,356
<i>times e ^ i ∙ (Kx ∙ x + Ky ∙ y).</i>

256
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:44,538
<i>Well... what does this resemble?</i>

257
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:51,409
<i>Maybe you've come across
similar expressions already?</i>

258
00:15:53,501 --> 00:15:58,780
<i>Well, this is the Fourier transformation
of the object.</i>

259
00:16:00,009 --> 00:16:03,768
<i>Or, to obtain the MR image,</i>

260
00:16:03,768 --> 00:16:06,372
<i>we have to do the Fourier transformation
of the signal.</i>

261
00:16:06,372 --> 00:16:09,289
<i>Remember, this is the signal we record.</i>

262
00:16:09,289 --> 00:16:11,260
<i>This is with the variable transformation.</i>

263
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:15,779
<i>We have a Fourier representation,
to get this from this,</i>

264
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:19,050
<i>we have to do the Fourier transformation,
so we get the magnetization</i>

265
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:24,701
<i>by doing the Fourier transformation
of the signal here in K space.</i>

266
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:32,331
So, K space and real space,
that's like Fourier space and real space.

267
00:16:32,331 --> 00:16:36,101
It's like reciprocal space,
that's the K space, the term here.

268
00:16:36,101 --> 00:16:38,624
X and Y are the real space,
but the image--

269
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:41,860
the process of acquiring the image--

270
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,930
with MRI, essentially
what we are acquiring

271
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:49,191
is the Fourier transformation
of the object.

272
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,957
And to obtain from the data
that's stored in the computer--

273
00:16:51,957 --> 00:16:54,012
to obtain the image, what one has to do

274
00:16:54,012 --> 00:16:57,330
is a two-dimensional
Fourier transformation.
