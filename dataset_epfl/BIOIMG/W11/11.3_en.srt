1
00:00:04,353 --> 00:00:07,474
To understand the basic imaging sequence--

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:12,833
to understand how basic information
is spatially encoded with MRI--

3
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:15,814
we need to deal with the question on

4
00:00:15,814 --> 00:00:18,614
what is the effect
of the gradient on the signal,

5
00:00:18,614 --> 00:00:20,864
and how do we make, for example,

6
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:25,345
the signal maximal
under the influence of a gradient?

7
00:00:25,345 --> 00:00:27,976
Let's first look at the signal
as a function of time.

8
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:30,754
So we have an object,
we have a gradient along <i>y</i> here--

9
00:00:30,754 --> 00:00:33,844
now I'll use <i>y</i>,
just because it pleases me;

10
00:00:33,844 --> 00:00:36,235
we don't always have gradient along <i>x</i>--

11
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:37,717
so we have the magnetization along <i>y</i>.

12
00:00:37,717 --> 00:00:41,960
This is the equivalent equation
that we had two slides earlier.

13
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:45,515
If we now look at this equation

14
00:00:45,515 --> 00:00:48,248
then we can see that for--

15
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:52,524
this is our complex numbers,
so again, the real part is <i>x</i>,

16
00:00:52,524 --> 00:00:54,968
the imaginary part
represents the <i>y</i> component

17
00:00:54,968 --> 00:00:57,129
of the magnetization or of the signal--

18
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:59,200
and if we look at this equation here

19
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:04,118
then we can see that at <i>time_zero</i>,
this term is 1 and then we are getting

20
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:08,300
the signal as a function of time
is the magnetization, it's constant.

21
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,323
However, if we apply the gradient
and we look at times bigger than zero,

22
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:15,432
then we have, increasingly,

23
00:01:15,432 --> 00:01:18,954
one magnetization vector corresponding
to a positive <i>y</i> position,

24
00:01:18,954 --> 00:01:20,533
moving in one direction,

25
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:23,956
the other magnetization
rotating in the other direction

26
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:25,474
or in a complex plane.

27
00:01:25,474 --> 00:01:29,445
Now the complex numbers
according to their position along <i>y</i>

28
00:01:29,445 --> 00:01:35,054
will have a different phase
and they will no longer add co-linearly.

29
00:01:35,054 --> 00:01:37,487
And this is called <i>dephasing</i>.

30
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:40,978
So our signal is maximal
at the beginning.

31
00:01:41,524 --> 00:01:45,833
So let's look at a gradient--
and I will here take a gradient along <i>y</i>.

32
00:01:45,833 --> 00:01:48,936
I'll have it at zero,
then I'll have it at a negative value,

33
00:01:48,936 --> 00:01:52,652
and then I'll put it to the same value
that is positive here.

34
00:01:53,216 --> 00:01:55,627
We're going to consider
these three time points here

35
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:58,796
where we switch the current
in the gradient coil

36
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:01,807
and we're now looking at
the phase of the magnetization--

37
00:02:01,807 --> 00:02:06,928
that is this term here, over time,

38
00:02:06,928 --> 00:02:08,979
starting here at <i>time_zero</i>,

39
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:13,734
where we have
this magnetization here in phase.

40
00:02:14,415 --> 00:02:18,369
So we're looking at the phase:
that's this term here just before the <i>i</i>.

41
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,109
So if we take one position along <i>y</i>

42
00:02:22,109 --> 00:02:25,930
then we are getting a phase
that evolves this way,

43
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:27,490
I will plot here...

44
00:02:29,758 --> 00:02:34,280
In terms of position, we have <i>y</i> and <i>x</i>.

45
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,101
So we'll have this position--
we're looking at one position in <i>y</i>

46
00:02:39,101 --> 00:02:42,011
so we'll take this position, <i>y</i> is small,

47
00:02:42,011 --> 00:02:46,083
and here we have all the magnetization
at <i>time_zero</i> are in phase

48
00:02:46,083 --> 00:02:49,137
so they're all co-linear.

49
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:52,554
Now we'll take the next position in <i>y</i>
which is a bit further away,

50
00:02:52,554 --> 00:02:55,115
so <i>G_y y</i> is bigger,

51
00:02:55,115 --> 00:02:59,741
so the phase is bigger,
the slope is bigger here

52
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:03,583
and here the slope is inverted
because we invert the <i>sin</i> of <i>G_y</i>.

53
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:07,235
For the third position, we have this--

54
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:10,666
and we'll just continue equidistantly,
that's the fourth,

55
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,920
and that will be the fifth here,

56
00:03:15,067 --> 00:03:17,907
the sixth, this position,

57
00:03:17,907 --> 00:03:20,474
and the seventh, at this position.

58
00:03:21,328 --> 00:03:27,140
And now what we see is-- because here
the slope is proportional to position,

59
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,479
and here the slope
is also proportional to position

60
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:32,015
but the slope here
is equal to the negative of that slope,

61
00:03:32,015 --> 00:03:35,769
so since this time here
equals to this time,

62
00:03:35,769 --> 00:03:38,979
and so we'll have a point here
where all the magnetizations

63
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:41,987
are again in phase--
they have a phase of zero,

64
00:03:41,987 --> 00:03:45,454
and this creates a maximal signal,

65
00:03:45,454 --> 00:03:49,005
and that's what we call <i>echo formation</i>

66
00:03:49,005 --> 00:03:51,757
and what you would typically see
in the computer--

67
00:03:51,757 --> 00:03:55,802
the digitized signal that's observed
is something like this; it's an echo.

68
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,357
That's what is called an echo.

69
00:03:58,357 --> 00:04:01,648
So if we look at the phases,
we have dephasing.

70
00:04:01,648 --> 00:04:03,595
Dephasing means that
the magnetization vector's

71
00:04:03,595 --> 00:04:05,985
spread out in the transverse plane,

72
00:04:05,985 --> 00:04:09,463
they no longer act co-linearly
so signal decreases,

73
00:04:09,463 --> 00:04:12,425
and then, when they all
come together again,

74
00:04:12,425 --> 00:04:16,892
we call this phase
of the evolution <i>rephasing</i>.

75
00:04:17,698 --> 00:04:21,537
And so, if we look,
what happens over time,

76
00:04:21,537 --> 00:04:26,560
then we have rephasing,
here we have echo, all is in phase,

77
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:29,214
now we have dephasing--
you can see they're not in phase--

78
00:04:29,214 --> 00:04:32,066
now they are reversing their orientation

79
00:04:32,066 --> 00:04:33,747
and they are in phase again.

80
00:04:33,747 --> 00:04:37,047
So we have dephasing--
the magnetization vector's spread out,

81
00:04:37,047 --> 00:04:40,746
then they come together again--
here they're again together.

82
00:04:40,746 --> 00:04:45,096
And this is happening
if the area of the gradient here

83
00:04:45,096 --> 00:04:46,715
equals the area of the gradient here

84
00:04:46,715 --> 00:04:52,070
or if the integral sum of all the gradient
over time here equals to zero,

85
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:54,118
in more general terms.

86
00:04:54,118 --> 00:04:57,285
So if we have equal area,
positive and negative,

87
00:04:57,285 --> 00:04:59,978
then we have echo formation.

88
00:05:00,411 --> 00:05:02,520
And this time here, from here to here,

89
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:07,234
is typically called the <i>time of echo</i>,
or <i>echo time</i>, <i>TE</i>.

90
00:05:07,234 --> 00:05:10,241
And if we go on afterwards,
then of course we have dephasing

91
00:05:10,241 --> 00:05:12,192
and now the vectors are all dephased

92
00:05:12,192 --> 00:05:17,791
and they are no longer producing
a measurable signal

93
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,303
after a certain amount of time.

94
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:23,343
So if we call this time here <i>tau</i>

95
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:30,022
then from here to here <i>tau</i> is equal to 
<i>TE/2</i> in our particular example.

96
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:33,754
So we can write the magnetization
at this time point

97
00:05:33,754 --> 00:05:36,855
is equal to the transverse magnetization
at <i>time_zero</i>

98
00:05:36,855 --> 00:05:39,042
times the phase term

99
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:43,518
and this is now being done
by integrating along <i>y</i>.

100
00:05:43,518 --> 00:05:45,856
We have the minus here
because the gradient is negative,

101
00:05:45,856 --> 00:05:48,650
so <i>G_y</i> is the magnitude of the gradient.

102
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:51,926
The gradient during time <i>t</i>--

103
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:54,275
time <i>t</i> is this time here...

104
00:05:56,398 --> 00:05:58,708
that denotes this time here--

105
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:03,389
the signal during time <i>t</i> is proportional
to the transverse magnetization:

106
00:06:03,389 --> 00:06:06,609
that's the sum of the
transverse magnetization over the object.

107
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:09,871
So we sum along <i>dy</i>,
it's the magnetization along <i>y</i>

108
00:06:09,871 --> 00:06:12,020
at <i>time tau</i>

109
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,289
times this term here.

110
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:17,850
Here it's subpositive because we have
changed the <i>sin</i> of <i>G_y</i>.

111
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:20,834
And now we'll put this together--

112
00:06:20,834 --> 00:06:24,114
that is, we'll insert this into here--

113
00:06:24,114 --> 00:06:28,271
the magnetization at the time <i>tau</i>
is proportional to this.

114
00:06:28,271 --> 00:06:29,815
We'll put this in here,

115
00:06:29,815 --> 00:06:33,712
and in the equations I have just assumed
that they are equal--

116
00:06:33,712 --> 00:06:36,034
this is really a proportionality;

117
00:06:36,034 --> 00:06:38,440
then we have the magnetization
at <i>time_zero</i> here--

118
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,117
the transverse magnetization
times these two terms.

119
00:06:43,146 --> 00:06:45,560
So this term we can understand:
that's the magnetization rate

120
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,317
after the RF pulse and here,
what about these terms?

121
00:06:48,317 --> 00:06:54,371
So I will look at these two terms
and I will re-write them into the exponent

122
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:58,975
and so we now have <i>e</i> to the <i>i gamma G_y y</i>
times <i>t</i> minus <i>tau</i>.

123
00:07:00,819 --> 00:07:04,327
And so this means-- this term here,
if you look at this integral,

124
00:07:04,327 --> 00:07:06,714
with the same argument that we had here--

125
00:07:06,714 --> 00:07:10,979
if this phase term is zero,
then we have maximal signal

126
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:14,280
and that is happening when <i>t</i> equals <i>tau</i>

127
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,297
and so we have echo formation

128
00:07:16,297 --> 00:07:20,671
and this is given at this point.

129
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:23,579
So this is what is being observed.

130
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:30,589
Okay, so this is a graphical,
mathematical demonstration

131
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:34,951
that, in a simple experiment,
where we have a gradient that's negative

132
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:40,529
and then we put it to positive,
that after two times this period <i>tau</i>

133
00:07:40,529 --> 00:07:44,143
we echo formation how it occurs.

134
00:07:44,783 --> 00:07:48,476
Now this is not easy to understand
and one has to really think about it,

135
00:07:48,476 --> 00:07:55,088
how to visualize that, and I'm going
to now try to take a different approach.

136
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:59,392
So let's try to look
at echo formation here,

137
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:02,126
under a different viewpoint.

138
00:08:02,126 --> 00:08:04,526
And what we're going to do here is
we're going to suppose

139
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:08,662
that our magnetization vectors
are represented by--

140
00:08:08,662 --> 00:08:13,896
the position of our magnetization vectors
are represented by a tortoise here,

141
00:08:13,896 --> 00:08:15,520
and a hare.

142
00:08:15,984 --> 00:08:18,644
And we're going to
make them run on a circle

143
00:08:18,644 --> 00:08:20,242
because they're magnetization vectors--

144
00:08:20,242 --> 00:08:23,954
the tortoise and the hare represent
the tips of magnetization.

145
00:08:25,073 --> 00:08:27,427
And they're going to be running
at a certain velocity--

146
00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:29,828
that is, they are going to have--
this velocity is given

147
00:08:29,828 --> 00:08:32,637
by angle of velocity
times radius of the circle.

148
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,667
So this is like track and field--

149
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,259
instead of having an oval,
we're running in a circle.

150
00:08:37,569 --> 00:08:40,998
So, at <i>time_zero</i>
they're both at the same position.

151
00:08:40,998 --> 00:08:44,598
Now we'll have the hare running fast
in one direction,

152
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:49,326
and the tortoise running slow
in the other direction.

153
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,660
So that is the precession
of fast and slow magnetization.

154
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:57,202
At <i>time_zero</i> they're both up here,
so they're here,

155
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,761
and now we'll have them run
for a time of <i>TE/2</i> seconds,

156
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:04,821
or milliseconds if you want.

157
00:09:04,821 --> 00:09:07,020
Since the hare runs faster,

158
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:11,852
he will have run a bigger distance
than the tortoise, which is much slower.

159
00:09:11,852 --> 00:09:14,537
And here, for simplicity, we'll assume

160
00:09:14,537 --> 00:09:17,635
that the tortoise is running
in the opposite direction as the hare--

161
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:21,120
so tortoise has run until here,
the hare is until here,

162
00:09:22,276 --> 00:09:24,005
they have run in this direction.

163
00:09:24,005 --> 00:09:27,563
Now, after <i>TE/2</i> seconds

164
00:09:27,563 --> 00:09:31,813
we give the command
to reverse the direction--

165
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:34,261
so that is a 180-degree turn.

166
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:37,585
We're telling them, instead of running
as you've been running,

167
00:09:37,585 --> 00:09:40,927
now you run in the opposite direction,
still on the circle,

168
00:09:40,927 --> 00:09:42,848
but with the same velocity.

169
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:46,838
So this is a 180-degree turn, turn around,

170
00:09:46,838 --> 00:09:49,965
and now we're running back to--

171
00:09:49,965 --> 00:09:52,622
we're letting them run again
for the same amount of time.

172
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:56,550
Now, the distance
that they're going to run on the circle,

173
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,231
for the same amount of time,
since they are running at the same speed,

174
00:10:00,231 --> 00:10:04,002
the distance traveled is going to be
the same but in the opposite direction.

175
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:08,032
So, after time <i>TE</i>-- after <i>TE</i> seconds--

176
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:13,318
they're both going to end up again
at the same position, like this.

177
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:16,710
Okay, so is this now clearer?

178
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:20,004
So we have had a tortoise
slowly running on a circle

179
00:10:20,004 --> 00:10:22,341
and a hare running fast on the circle.

180
00:10:22,341 --> 00:10:27,553
We've said these represent
the tips of the magnetization vectors,

181
00:10:27,553 --> 00:10:29,631
of two magnetization vectors.

182
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:31,262
Now the argument that I've made here

183
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:36,755
is assuming two different velocities
for tortoise and hare--

184
00:10:36,755 --> 00:10:40,814
so two different precessional
frequencies-- that's the <i>omega</i> here.

185
00:10:40,814 --> 00:10:46,196
Now we can imagine
what we have in our organ of interest,

186
00:10:46,196 --> 00:10:51,215
we have literally hundreds of thousands
of different tortoises and hares

187
00:10:51,215 --> 00:10:52,905
and they're all running
at different speeds

188
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:55,785
and different directions, etc.

189
00:10:55,785 --> 00:11:00,465
I have made no assumption whatsoever
on the specific circumstances

190
00:11:00,465 --> 00:11:03,527
on the speed of the tortoise or the hare,

191
00:11:03,527 --> 00:11:06,646
so this is valid for any two pairs
that we compare

192
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:10,235
that they will arrive after time <i>TE</i>

193
00:11:10,235 --> 00:11:14,319
at the same original position
that they had.

194
00:11:15,658 --> 00:11:19,409
So this is, in general, the case.

195
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:24,680
The only thing that we've imposed is,
they're always running at the same speed

196
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:28,845
and after half of the time,
they reverse the direction.

197
00:11:29,366 --> 00:11:31,960
That's the influence of the gradient.

198
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:37,651
And so the time <i>TE</i> is also called
the <i>echo time</i>

199
00:11:37,651 --> 00:11:41,525
and that's what we will refer to
very often from now on.

200
00:11:42,143 --> 00:11:45,572
So I hope this is now a bit clearer,
how echo formation is done

201
00:11:45,572 --> 00:11:50,163
under the influence of a switched gradient
where we change the polarity.

202
00:11:50,163 --> 00:11:52,118
There we changed--
with the polarity of the gradient

203
00:11:52,118 --> 00:11:54,878
we changed the direction
in which the magnetization vector,

204
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:57,273
at a given position,

205
00:11:57,273 --> 00:12:01,422
is precessing.

206
00:12:02,815 --> 00:12:08,205
To understand better the diagrams
I am going to be showing after this slide

207
00:12:08,205 --> 00:12:11,507
I have to address one question,
and that is:

208
00:12:11,507 --> 00:12:15,987
Is it important when exactly
a gradient is being applied?

209
00:12:15,987 --> 00:12:21,037
What is its influence when the gradient
is being applied, on the signal?

210
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:24,714
We'll consider here an experiment
where we have a gradient along <i>x</i>,

211
00:12:24,714 --> 00:12:26,269
it goes from negative to positive--

212
00:12:26,269 --> 00:12:29,198
doesn't actually matter
exactly what we're doing here,

213
00:12:29,198 --> 00:12:31,659
but we'll take the same example
as we had before,

214
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:35,230
so if these two areas
are equal in magnitude,

215
00:12:35,230 --> 00:12:39,358
then we will have, at this time point,
we will have echo formation.

216
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:42,982
And this time here
we call the echo time, <i>TE</i>.

217
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:47,420
And we will put a note here,
the start of this time counting here

218
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,359
as the time <i>tau</i>.

219
00:12:49,359 --> 00:12:53,141
And this time here will be <i>2 tau</i>.

220
00:12:53,141 --> 00:12:56,733
Now I will take a gradient along <i>z</i>
and I will switch it

221
00:12:56,733 --> 00:13:01,082
just before the green gradient along <i>x</i>,

222
00:13:01,082 --> 00:13:03,651
so this gradient here
is applied just before,

223
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:06,382
it's turned off at the time <i>tau</i>.

224
00:13:06,382 --> 00:13:09,795
This is its effect on the phase.

225
00:13:09,795 --> 00:13:13,814
So that is what we call
the sequential application

226
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:16,474
of two different gradient orientations.

227
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:22,134
Now we'll take the same experiment again.

228
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,220
We have the gradient along <i>x</i>,

229
00:13:25,566 --> 00:13:27,494
we have echo formation,

230
00:13:28,296 --> 00:13:31,255
and we'll apply now
this same gradient along <i>z</i>

231
00:13:31,255 --> 00:13:34,875
but we'll apply it at the same time
as we apply the negative lobe

232
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:37,283
of the <i>x</i> gradient.

233
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:41,583
So everything is identical
except the timing for the red gradient.

234
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:44,684
Here's again the echo time, <i>TE</i>,
and this is what we call

235
00:13:44,684 --> 00:13:48,114
the simultaneous application
of the gradient.

236
00:13:49,264 --> 00:13:50,847
And now the question is:

237
00:13:50,847 --> 00:13:56,536
Is there going to be a difference
on the echo that we record here?

238
00:13:56,536 --> 00:13:57,680
Does it make a difference?

239
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:00,124
Can we tell from
the signal that we record here,

240
00:14:00,124 --> 00:14:02,232
whether this gradient's been applied here,

241
00:14:02,232 --> 00:14:04,590
or whether it's been applied here?

242
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:08,001
So let's look at the magnetization
in the left example after time <i>tau</i>--

243
00:14:08,001 --> 00:14:10,210
it's given by the magnetization
at <i>time_zero</i>,

244
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,653
times <i>e</i> to the <i>gamma G_z z</i> times <i>tau</i>--

245
00:14:13,653 --> 00:14:16,155
this is the effect of this gradient here--

246
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:19,970
and on the right side,
the magnetization at the time <i>tau</i>

247
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,951
is still the magnetization at <i>time_zero</i>,

248
00:14:21,951 --> 00:14:25,809
we have not done anything
to the phase of the magnetization.

249
00:14:25,809 --> 00:14:27,930
This is always done
in the rotating reference frame

250
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:30,151
so we don't consider the effect of <i>B_0</i>.

251
00:14:30,151 --> 00:14:33,107
It makes it easier to write less terms.

252
00:14:33,513 --> 00:14:37,454
At times <i>2 tau</i> we have the magnetization
at times <i>tau</i> here, that we start with--

253
00:14:37,454 --> 00:14:40,185
we're always talking about
transverse magnetization of course--

254
00:14:40,185 --> 00:14:43,907
times <i>e</i> to the <i>minus gamma G_x</i>
times <i>x</i> times <i>tau</i>.

255
00:14:43,907 --> 00:14:47,245
We have here the time here,
from here to here, is <i>tau</i>.

256
00:14:47,245 --> 00:14:51,195
So that's the magnetization
at times <i>2 tau</i>.

257
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:55,958
And we can now substitute <i>M</i> of <i>tau</i>--
magnetizaton of time <i>tau</i>--

258
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:59,952
into this equation here,
we get this term that is over here.

259
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:06,533
On the right-hand side, the magnetization
that is now recorded times <i>2 tau</i>

260
00:15:06,533 --> 00:15:08,659
is the magnetization at times <i>tau</i>

261
00:15:08,659 --> 00:15:13,839
times <i>e</i> to the <i>gamma G_x x</i>
plus <i>G_z z</i> times <i>tau</i>.

262
00:15:14,662 --> 00:15:16,897
And what we have used here
is just a general term--

263
00:15:16,897 --> 00:15:20,062
that's the magnetic field-- the <i>B_0</i>--

264
00:15:20,062 --> 00:15:21,551
in the presence of a gradient,

265
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:24,672
now we take the <i>B_0</i> out because
we're in a rotating reference frame,

266
00:15:24,672 --> 00:15:27,503
but the variation
of the magnetic field in space

267
00:15:27,503 --> 00:15:33,100
is given by <i>gamma</i> times the scalar product
of the gradient vector times position.

268
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:37,981
And here the gradient vector
has components along <i>x</i> and <i>z</i>.

269
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,553
So we can rewrite this now:
<i>M_z m</i> of <i>tau</i> is <i>M_0</i>.

270
00:15:42,553 --> 00:15:47,341
We'll write these terms here
and we'll split them according to <i>x</i> and <i>z</i>.

271
00:15:48,443 --> 00:15:51,210
And now what we will notice
is this term here,

272
00:15:51,562 --> 00:15:53,283
and this term here.

273
00:15:53,283 --> 00:15:57,682
Upon inspection, we notice
that these two terms are identical.

274
00:15:58,484 --> 00:16:02,994
So the magnetization <i>M</i> of <i>zero</i>
in both cases is the same--

275
00:16:02,994 --> 00:16:05,132
we start out here,
we don't know yet what's happening

276
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:09,036
so the magnetization at that point
has to be the same.

277
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:13,708
The conclusion here is the application
of two gradients that are orthogonal--

278
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:17,877
say <i>x</i> and <i>z</i> in this particular example,
could be any two directions--

279
00:16:17,877 --> 00:16:21,785
simultaneously or sequentially,
doesn't matter,

280
00:16:21,785 --> 00:16:27,379
it produces the same phase for the
transverse magnetization subsequently.

281
00:16:27,379 --> 00:16:30,007
So what this means, basically, is

282
00:16:30,007 --> 00:16:35,838
that we have the magnetization
described here or described here.

283
00:16:35,838 --> 00:16:39,879
These two diagrams, in terms of
what's happening to the magnetization--

284
00:16:39,879 --> 00:16:43,971
the transverse magnetization--
to its phase, are identical.

285
00:16:43,971 --> 00:16:46,811
So if we have difficulty understanding
the diagram on the right

286
00:16:46,811 --> 00:16:50,718
we can always suppose that this,
on the left, is happening.

287
00:16:51,232 --> 00:16:55,672
So at time <i>TE</i>, the magnetization is given
by the magnetization at <i>2 tau</i>

288
00:16:55,672 --> 00:16:57,722
times this term here,

289
00:16:57,722 --> 00:17:01,599
and we can write this now,
we may put in the magnetization of <i>2 tau</i>

290
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:03,703
into this term here,

291
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:06,344
and then we get
the magnetization of <i>time_zero</i> times

292
00:17:06,344 --> 00:17:10,726
<i>e</i> to the <i>i gamma G_z</i>
times <i>z</i> times <i>tau</i>.

293
00:17:10,726 --> 00:17:15,064
The effect of <i>x</i> of course,
the gradient is nullified exactly at <i>TE</i>,

294
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:19,275
so we only have the influence
of the <i>z</i> gradient.

295
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:22,607
Okay, so this is just to bear in mind
if you see the diagram where the gradients

296
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:25,816
are in two different directions,
are applied simultaneously.

297
00:17:25,816 --> 00:17:28,289
If this creates conceptual problems

298
00:17:28,289 --> 00:17:31,070
you can always think of that
you have much more space

299
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,608
to draw them sequentially
like on the left-hand side

300
00:17:34,608 --> 00:17:37,008
if that is easier to understand.

301
00:17:37,008 --> 00:17:42,160
I didn't do it because
it makes the display of what is to come

302
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,216
very crowded and very difficult to read.

303
00:17:45,571 --> 00:17:50,948
So now I will introduce the basic elements
of the so-called <i>gradient echo sequence</i>.

304
00:17:50,948 --> 00:17:54,691
We'll start out, of course,
with a RF pulse--

305
00:17:54,691 --> 00:17:56,501
this is what we do with the RF pulse,

306
00:17:56,501 --> 00:17:59,122
we flip the longitudinal magnetization

307
00:17:59,122 --> 00:18:02,735
by <i>alpha</i> degrees
into the transverse plane.

308
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:07,429
We start out with
a magnetization at <i>time_0</i>

309
00:18:07,429 --> 00:18:10,712
which is just the <i>z</i> component
before the RF pulse.

310
00:18:12,557 --> 00:18:15,249
This defines one time point here.

311
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:18,743
We will now have
the frequency encode gradient,

312
00:18:18,743 --> 00:18:21,084
we have it negative and then positive,

313
00:18:21,084 --> 00:18:25,496
so that's essentially the situation we've
been discussing in the previous slides.

314
00:18:26,524 --> 00:18:31,365
The negative area here
equals to the positive area here.

315
00:18:31,365 --> 00:18:35,947
When this is matched then we have,
at this time point,

316
00:18:35,947 --> 00:18:39,775
we have echo formation,
and that is the echo time.

317
00:18:40,269 --> 00:18:42,174
So this is what we observe here--

318
00:18:42,174 --> 00:18:45,003
we have the signal as a function of time

319
00:18:45,003 --> 00:18:48,528
and we have echo formation
exactly at echo time.

320
00:18:49,377 --> 00:18:53,674
Now this is an experiment
that we've discussed implicitly--

321
00:18:53,674 --> 00:18:55,615
I have not drawn the RF pulses--

322
00:18:55,615 --> 00:18:58,217
now we want to do slide selection,
and as we've discussed

323
00:18:58,217 --> 00:18:59,815
earlier in the course,

324
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:03,849
this is done by applying,
at the same time as the RF pulses,

325
00:19:03,849 --> 00:19:07,619
to apply a gradient, and here
we'll call this gradient the <i>z</i> gradient.

326
00:19:07,619 --> 00:19:11,269
So what this <i>alpha</i> pulse now does--
<i>alpha degree</i> pulse--

327
00:19:11,269 --> 00:19:13,579
it will flip the magnetization
by <i>alpha</i> degrees

328
00:19:13,579 --> 00:19:15,888
into the transverse plane

329
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:20,870
at the Larmor condition defined
by the radio frequency of the RF pulse.

330
00:19:22,937 --> 00:19:25,901
And we have a positive gradient afterwards

331
00:19:25,901 --> 00:19:29,692
and a negative gradient subsequently.

332
00:19:30,725 --> 00:19:33,060
Now why do we have to deal

333
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:36,442
with this gradient switching
in the slide selection?

334
00:19:36,442 --> 00:19:38,594
Wouldn't it be just enough
to turn on the gradient,

335
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:41,046
we do the slide selection,
and we're done with it?

336
00:19:41,831 --> 00:19:47,400
Well, the situation is also--
Here you can see.

337
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,176
that previously we have assumed

338
00:19:49,176 --> 00:19:51,214
the gradient switched on instantaneously,

339
00:19:51,214 --> 00:19:54,376
and here you can see
in this gross exaggeration,

340
00:19:54,376 --> 00:19:57,716
that the gradient switching
takes some time.

341
00:19:57,716 --> 00:20:03,613
And this has to do with the question of
why do have to have echo formation?

342
00:20:04,653 --> 00:20:09,391
We have, after the RF pulse,
the gradient is on.

343
00:20:09,391 --> 00:20:11,288
So the magnetization
is in a transverse plane,

344
00:20:11,288 --> 00:20:15,534
it will spread out, if we turn it off,
the magnetization will stay spread out.

345
00:20:15,534 --> 00:20:17,829
If it's spread out,
that means it's spread out

346
00:20:17,829 --> 00:20:19,552
according to the position along <i>z</i>,

347
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:23,389
the magnetization vectors
no longer act co-linearly,

348
00:20:23,389 --> 00:20:26,724
and therefore the signal is reduced.

349
00:20:26,724 --> 00:20:28,698
What this negative gradient here does

350
00:20:28,698 --> 00:20:31,660
it takes into account
this dead time here that we have

351
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:34,380
and makes them run
in the opposite direction,

352
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,163
the magnetization vectors,

353
00:20:36,163 --> 00:20:39,474
and with a matching condition,
they will be all co-linear

354
00:20:39,474 --> 00:20:42,514
and we will have maximal signal.

355
00:20:43,748 --> 00:20:48,736
So, let's look at the effect if we don't
turn on this negative gradient,

356
00:20:48,736 --> 00:20:51,424
the signal is given by
the transverse magnetization

357
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:53,325
across the slice,

358
00:20:53,325 --> 00:20:57,195
times <i>e</i> to the <i>i gamma</i> and
<i>G_z</i> times <i>z</i> over <i>tau</i>

359
00:20:57,195 --> 00:20:59,031
integrated over <i>z</i>.

360
00:20:59,031 --> 00:21:01,633
So this term, with time,
will eventually go to zero--

361
00:21:01,633 --> 00:21:02,799
that's dephasing.

362
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:06,642
So we can not record
the maximal signal, the signal decays,

363
00:21:06,642 --> 00:21:09,102
and it actually decays rather fast.

364
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:13,885
It is a decay that is almost like a FID,
it's not <i>T 2</i>,

365
00:21:13,885 --> 00:21:15,947
it's the effect of the dephasing

366
00:21:15,947 --> 00:21:19,772
from the different positions
along the slice.

367
00:21:22,393 --> 00:21:24,168
We can rephase this term,

368
00:21:24,168 --> 00:21:29,297
we can make the magnetization
co-linear again by rephasing,

369
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:32,267
that is, by applying a gradient
with opposite polarity--

370
00:21:32,267 --> 00:21:33,751
here it's strong negative--

371
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:36,442
and this leads to echo formation.

372
00:21:37,318 --> 00:21:40,655
And if we write this in general terms,
and for this slice,

373
00:21:40,655 --> 00:21:42,846
if we integrate over this slice,

374
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:49,961
we have the magnetization,
times <i>e</i> to the--

375
00:21:49,961 --> 00:21:53,269
in general terms the phase is here given
by phase of time,

376
00:21:53,269 --> 00:21:56,353
the phase is given by the integral of...

377
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:02,997
for a given position
of <i>gamma G_z T</i> over time.

378
00:22:03,909 --> 00:22:06,293
And we want this to be maximal--

379
00:22:06,293 --> 00:22:08,762
that's what gives us echo formation.

380
00:22:08,762 --> 00:22:12,802
So this phase term,
this term must be maximal

381
00:22:12,802 --> 00:22:15,064
and there is actually
a nice condition for that

382
00:22:15,064 --> 00:22:18,186
and that is that
the integral of the gradient,

383
00:22:18,186 --> 00:22:21,131
from zero to a certain time
of the gradient

384
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:24,014
is equal to zero.

385
00:22:24,014 --> 00:22:26,647
So that basically is
what's depicted here--

386
00:22:26,647 --> 00:22:28,616
this area equals to this area,

387
00:22:28,616 --> 00:22:31,676
that's the same thing as saying
it's the integral over time

388
00:22:31,676 --> 00:22:35,982
is equal to zero, and that leads
to echo formation.

389
00:22:36,756 --> 00:22:40,797
So in this example we have
the slice select, the slice orientation,

390
00:22:40,797 --> 00:22:43,228
the slice gradient
is perpendicular to the read,

391
00:22:43,228 --> 00:22:45,585
or frequency encode gradient,

392
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:51,023
so <i>x</i> and <i>z</i> are presumed to be orthogonal.

393
00:22:51,389 --> 00:22:55,610
Whether we call them <i>x</i> or <i>z</i> or <i>y</i> and <i>z</i>
and so on, whatever we call them,

394
00:22:55,610 --> 00:23:00,019
doesn't matter-- the main condition here
is that they are orthogonal.

395
00:23:00,019 --> 00:23:02,432
Of course, at some point,
the ADC is opened up,

396
00:23:02,432 --> 00:23:04,842
the data is sampled,
that is done here,

397
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:06,742
and then the recorded signal

398
00:23:06,742 --> 00:23:10,672
that is recorded in the scanner

399
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:12,551
looks like this.

400
00:23:12,551 --> 00:23:14,384
What is crucial here is
we don't just record

401
00:23:14,384 --> 00:23:17,254
from the maximal echo and then onward,

402
00:23:17,254 --> 00:23:20,760
we record also the first half of the echo.

403
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:25,643
This is done because this is--
at very little cost of time,

404
00:23:25,643 --> 00:23:28,394
one can increase the sensitivity

405
00:23:28,394 --> 00:23:31,024
because there's more data points
that are being sampled.

406
00:23:31,885 --> 00:23:34,615
So this is your basic imaging sequence,

407
00:23:34,615 --> 00:23:36,366
the basic elements,

408
00:23:36,366 --> 00:23:39,585
and this describes what's happening

409
00:23:41,305 --> 00:23:43,525
every <i>TR</i> seconds.

410
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,341
That's your basic imaging sequence.
