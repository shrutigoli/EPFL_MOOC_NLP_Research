1
00:00:04,210 --> 00:00:07,624
This week's lectures 
are particularly difficult

2
00:00:07,624 --> 00:00:12,275
because we are going to introduce
how spatial information

3
00:00:12,275 --> 00:00:15,497
is encoded by magnetic resonance imaging.

4
00:00:15,497 --> 00:00:17,710
And as you will see,
this is done slightly differently

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,595
than the X-ray imaging techniques.

6
00:00:22,255 --> 00:00:25,657
First, however, I want 
to start out with a recap

7
00:00:25,657 --> 00:00:28,339
of what we know
about magnetic resonance.

8
00:00:29,059 --> 00:00:33,836
We have so far introduced 
the static magnetic field.

9
00:00:33,836 --> 00:00:37,108
The static magnetic field, 
which is always called <i>B0,</i>

10
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:39,926
is necessary to create 
equilibrium magnetization.

11
00:00:39,926 --> 00:00:42,454
So as you enter the magnet

12
00:00:42,454 --> 00:00:45,924
you will build up a nuclear magnetization

13
00:00:45,924 --> 00:00:48,527
that's this equilibrium magnetization.

14
00:00:49,277 --> 00:00:53,252
We're typically talking about 
field strengths of 0.1 to 12 T.

15
00:00:53,252 --> 00:00:56,102
As a reference here, you have 
the earth's magnetic field,

16
00:00:56,102 --> 00:00:58,585
which is, as you can see,

17
00:00:58,585 --> 00:01:04,335
much smaller than the fields used for MRI.

18
00:01:05,585 --> 00:01:09,160
Then what we do is, 
this static magnetization,

19
00:01:09,160 --> 00:01:11,729
the equilibrium magnetization 
we've seen is not very interesting,

20
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,851
produces no signal, so what we need to do
is to excite the magnetization,

21
00:01:16,851 --> 00:01:19,554
that is flip the magnetization
into the transverse plane,

22
00:01:19,554 --> 00:01:21,630
and this is done using 
a radio frequency field,

23
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:24,857
which is applied at the Larmor frequency.

24
00:01:25,617 --> 00:01:28,654
The radio frequency field
is always denoted <i>B1.</i>

25
00:01:29,734 --> 00:01:33,343
It typically has a magnitude of 0.05 mT

26
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,646
and it is applied on-resonance.

27
00:01:35,646 --> 00:01:41,855
So this is compared to <i>B0</i>
in the order of tesla,

28
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:43,845
here we're on the order of millitesla,

29
00:01:43,845 --> 00:01:47,804
there's a considerable 
difference between the two.

30
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:53,030
After the excitation with the RF field

31
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:54,728
we have the magnetization transverse plane

32
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:57,388
and then this signal is being recorded,

33
00:01:57,388 --> 00:01:59,315
and this we have introduced last week,

34
00:01:59,315 --> 00:02:02,207
this is known as the <i>free induction decay.</i>

35
00:02:03,157 --> 00:02:05,597
We have seen that after this excitation,

36
00:02:05,597 --> 00:02:08,020
we are no longer 
at thermal dynamic equilibrium,

37
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,695
we have to get back 
to thermal dynamic equilibrium,

38
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:15,069
this is done by relaxation, 
T1 and T2, or T2 and T1.

39
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:19,790
T2 describes the decay 
of the transverse magnetization, <i>Mxy,</i>

40
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:25,592
and T1, the return to equilibrium
of the z magnetization, <i>Mz.</i>

41
00:02:27,092 --> 00:02:29,270
So the detection of the signal,

42
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:34,590
the FID, that is done 
also with the RF coils.

43
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:37,719
So both the excitation,

44
00:02:37,719 --> 00:02:39,878
the production of B1, 
the radio frequency field,

45
00:02:39,878 --> 00:02:41,331
and the detection of the signal

46
00:02:41,331 --> 00:02:44,380
is done with the same piece of hardware.

47
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:50,973
So this is what we've had so far 
with magnetic resonance.

48
00:02:51,593 --> 00:02:55,143
We have seen that the RF coils 
are used to measure the signal

49
00:02:55,143 --> 00:02:56,753
from the entire body.

50
00:02:57,243 --> 00:03:01,716
We have not introduced, 
therefore as such, spatial information.

51
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:05,573
The means of detecting the signal

52
00:03:05,573 --> 00:03:09,415
is done by observing 
the precessional frequency,

53
00:03:09,845 --> 00:03:12,835
which is the Larmor frequency 
given by <i>γ B0,</i>

54
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:16,355
under the influence 
of a static magnetic field.

55
00:03:18,535 --> 00:03:19,986
And we have seen last week,

56
00:03:19,986 --> 00:03:23,585
with this gives us also additional 
chemical information.

57
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:28,236
So now how do we encode 
the spatial information?

58
00:03:28,236 --> 00:03:33,576
How do we get spatial information
into our observation of the signal?

59
00:03:33,926 --> 00:03:37,886
And here the key is, let's suppose 
that we have the magnetic field,

60
00:03:37,886 --> 00:03:40,030
which is along z, the <i>B0</i> field,

61
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:44,559
and we'll add a small field
that varies linearly with space.

62
00:03:44,559 --> 00:03:46,639
So that's the <i>Gx</i> times <i>X</i> term here.

63
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:51,007
So now this magnetic field varies along x.

64
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:53,195
What happens now?

65
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:55,961
What we now have is that 
the Larmor frequency

66
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:58,877
becomes a linear function in position.

67
00:04:01,917 --> 00:04:05,331
So if we write the magnetic field along z

68
00:04:05,331 --> 00:04:11,171
and we produce it 
to vary spatially with x, y, and z,

69
00:04:11,171 --> 00:04:14,839
this spatial variation, we can define as

70
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:17,321
the derivative of the z component
of the magnetic field--

71
00:04:17,321 --> 00:04:19,654
remember static field is always along z--

72
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:22,733
with respect to position x, 
with respect to position y,

73
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:24,162
with respect to position z,

74
00:04:24,162 --> 00:04:28,233
each of those derivatives 
are the components of a vector

75
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:31,063
that we shall call <i>G</i> here.

76
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:37,554
So in general terms, then we have 
the static magnetic field,

77
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:42,624
<i>r</i> of the function of position
is given by the static field <i>B0,</i>

78
00:04:42,624 --> 00:04:47,227
plus this linear term, and here is
the scalar product of <i>G</i> times <i>r.</i>

79
00:04:47,227 --> 00:04:51,596
This is in all generality, the description
of the magnetic field now.

80
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:55,176
So for this case 
that we had here on the left,

81
00:04:55,176 --> 00:04:58,647
we use the vector <i>G</i>
that was equal to <i>(Gx, 0, 0),</i>

82
00:04:58,647 --> 00:05:02,624
so just along x that we had 
a spatial variation.

83
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:06,747
So if you look along x,
here is the x axis,

84
00:05:06,747 --> 00:05:11,057
the magnetic field starts from 
the center point, <i>B0,</i>

85
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,754
and varies linearly 
around the position zero.

86
00:05:13,754 --> 00:05:16,919
Here we have taken 
the rotating frame representation

87
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,567
so at center there is no magnetic field.

88
00:05:19,567 --> 00:05:24,248
Along y, so here's the y axis,
we have a linear variation.

89
00:05:24,248 --> 00:05:26,257
And finally, along z,

90
00:05:26,257 --> 00:05:30,140
we have the z component 
of the magnetization along z

91
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:33,404
that increases in opposite directions.

92
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:39,289
So now this vector <i>G,</i>
we call this the <i>gradient field,</i>

93
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:42,193
and the question is, 
"How is this gradient field

94
00:05:42,193 --> 00:05:44,406
actually physically generated?"

95
00:05:45,296 --> 00:05:47,395
Well, I'll recap here, the definition.

96
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:50,459
The gradient vector is given by 
the derivative of the z component

97
00:05:50,459 --> 00:05:53,363
of the magnetic field 
with respect to the position

98
00:05:53,363 --> 00:05:56,879
in each of the directions,
that gives the components of this vector.

99
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:59,551
To give you an idea 
what we're talking about here,

100
00:05:59,551 --> 00:06:04,052
this gradient field is typically 
on the order of <i>10 to 50 mT/m</i>

101
00:06:04,052 --> 00:06:08,323
and it can be switched in a timescale

102
00:06:08,323 --> 00:06:11,344
that's typically on the order of 100 μs.

103
00:06:11,914 --> 00:06:15,693
And this is used to determine 
the spatial position of the signal,

104
00:06:16,053 --> 00:06:19,029
as we have seen from the Larmor frequency.

105
00:06:21,999 --> 00:06:24,699
So how is this gradient field generated?

106
00:06:24,699 --> 00:06:28,727
It is actually generated by 
a set of three additional coils.

107
00:06:28,727 --> 00:06:31,292
They're so-called <i>gradient coil.</i>

108
00:06:32,382 --> 00:06:33,669
So these three additional coils,

109
00:06:33,669 --> 00:06:37,067
they are put into one additional coil
and that's the gradient coil.

110
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:39,115
So what we have here in green,

111
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:43,249
is the z coil that produces 
the linear field in z,

112
00:06:43,249 --> 00:06:46,818
in red, a linear variation of <i>Bz</i> along x,

113
00:06:46,818 --> 00:06:49,759
and in yellow, along y.

114
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:52,699
In blue here, you have also 
the RF coil indicated

115
00:06:52,699 --> 00:06:57,681
and the subject is now lying here
in this scheme inside the magnet.

116
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:03,490
So to give us an idea 
how this is achieved,

117
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:06,198
we'll take the z-gradient coil principle,

118
00:07:06,198 --> 00:07:08,930
just to give you an idea 
of how this is done,

119
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,682
and we'll use the Helmholtz pair here.

120
00:07:11,682 --> 00:07:13,875
So what we have first, 
we have a ring current

121
00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:17,712
that's rotating, in this sense, 
counterclockwise.

122
00:07:17,712 --> 00:07:20,971
And then at a certain distance,
we have a ring current

123
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:25,613
of the same structure, same diameter,
but now the current is rotating

124
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:27,863
in the opposite direction.

125
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:32,774
The <i>B0</i> is along z 
so it's in this direction,

126
00:07:33,934 --> 00:07:36,874
but parallel to the axis of the two coils.

127
00:07:37,394 --> 00:07:39,693
From <i>B0 sub r</i> we can calculate,

128
00:07:39,693 --> 00:07:43,434
given the current 
in the orange and red coil,

129
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:47,742
we can calculate exactly 
the magnetic field that's being produced.

130
00:07:47,742 --> 00:07:52,775
I'll just recap here the law 
for completeness sake,

131
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:56,846
but we'll just take a very 
qualitative argument here.

132
00:07:56,846 --> 00:08:00,315
And basically, we'll now draw here

133
00:08:00,315 --> 00:08:02,278
at the exact center 
between these two coils,

134
00:08:02,278 --> 00:08:05,137
the magnetic field generated 
by the orange coil,

135
00:08:05,137 --> 00:08:08,836
that's the magnetic field 
indicated in orange,

136
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:12,244
and by the red coil, 
it's indicated in red.

137
00:08:13,104 --> 00:08:18,734
And now if we go along at the axis,
center of the axis

138
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:21,389
will move in this direction
and in this direction.

139
00:08:21,389 --> 00:08:25,820
So if we move upwards, 
the field from the orange coil increases,

140
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:29,845
the opposing field generated 
by the red coil decreases,

141
00:08:29,845 --> 00:08:33,488
so the magnetic field 
increases in this direction.

142
00:08:33,488 --> 00:08:36,400
Here at the center for symmetry reasons,

143
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:40,442
the two magnetic fields 
generated by the two coils

144
00:08:40,442 --> 00:08:44,622
are equal in magnitude
but opposed, so it is zero.

145
00:08:44,622 --> 00:08:48,701
And if we go downwards 
in the direction of the red coil,

146
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:51,211
we have the contribution 
from the red coil that increases

147
00:08:51,211 --> 00:08:54,913
and the contribution 
from the orange coil that decreases.

148
00:08:54,913 --> 00:08:57,303
And that, in the end, in this situation

149
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:03,382
generates a, more or less,
linearly varying magnetic field along z,

150
00:09:03,382 --> 00:09:05,603
and this is the z component.

151
00:09:06,253 --> 00:09:08,255
So what does this look like in practice?

152
00:09:08,255 --> 00:09:14,043
In practice, one has a former
and then the coils are bound in copper

153
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:16,325
on top of this former here.

154
00:09:16,325 --> 00:09:19,295
So this is a coil 
that corresponds to the x coil,

155
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:24,284
here is the single gradient coil
that we have here on this structure.

156
00:09:24,284 --> 00:09:27,966
If we look at the complete gradient coil
then we have the complete structure.

157
00:09:27,966 --> 00:09:30,846
All the coils wound on top of each other.

158
00:09:30,846 --> 00:09:35,931
You can see here this z-gradient
is produced a bit more complex

159
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,828
than we have introduced.

160
00:09:37,828 --> 00:09:42,178
Note that the y-gradient 
and the x-gradient, these two,

161
00:09:42,178 --> 00:09:45,858
they are, construction wise, identical

162
00:09:45,858 --> 00:09:51,589
except one is the rotated version 
of the other, rotated by 90-degrees.

163
00:09:52,539 --> 00:09:55,300
So here are the three gradient coils.

164
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,178
Now, have you been in an MRI scan?

165
00:09:58,178 --> 00:10:01,800
Have you been a volunteer 
or do you know of someone of a volunteer?

166
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,340
Well, if you haven't been a volunteer,

167
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:06,850
you might have heard 
that MRI scans are loud.

168
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,572
And why are they so loud?

169
00:10:10,592 --> 00:10:15,510
We'll go after this question
with the following three experiments

170
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:18,823
that illustrate the basic principle

171
00:10:18,823 --> 00:10:24,342
that's behind the generation of sound

172
00:10:24,342 --> 00:10:26,362
during an MRI scan.

173
00:10:28,172 --> 00:10:30,812
Okay, in this experiment 
we have a permanent magnet here,

174
00:10:30,812 --> 00:10:34,175
and we'll be running a current 
through this structure here.

175
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:38,025
And I will turn on the current
and it will invert its polarity,

176
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:41,714
one can see the force 
that the magnetic field exerts

177
00:10:41,714 --> 00:10:43,755
on the conducting structure.

178
00:10:43,755 --> 00:10:47,034
First in this way, it's attracted 
towards the right.

179
00:10:48,184 --> 00:10:52,385
And now if I reverse the polarity,
it is pushed in the other direction.

180
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,776
That's a demonstration of 
the Lorentz force

181
00:10:55,776 --> 00:11:00,457
that's exerted on the structure 
that carries the current.

182
00:11:00,457 --> 00:11:04,517
This is what we have also 
in the MRI experiment.

183
00:11:06,537 --> 00:11:10,516
Okay, so in this experiment 
we have a coil here.

184
00:11:10,516 --> 00:11:12,450
I'll be pushing this button here

185
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:15,460
and this will introduce 
a magnetic field rapidly.

186
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:18,638
This magnetic field
induces a change in flux.

187
00:11:18,638 --> 00:11:22,780
This flux will induce eddy currents
in this aluminum ring,

188
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:26,329
which in turn, those currents,
through the Lorentz force,

189
00:11:26,329 --> 00:11:28,489
will interact with 
the magnetic field of the coil

190
00:11:28,489 --> 00:11:34,590
which will push back the ring
and the ring will fly upwards.

191
00:11:35,060 --> 00:11:37,653
So I will go 3, 2, 1.

192
00:11:37,653 --> 00:11:39,000
(metal ringing)

193
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,684
And here we go.

194
00:11:40,684 --> 00:11:43,802
If the ring is cut and cannot flow--

195
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:47,630
I'll do the same experiment here
so now we have no ring current

196
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:50,911
so there is no current that can flow,

197
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:53,229
push the button and nothing happens.

198
00:11:55,709 --> 00:12:02,224
Conversely, if I run an AC current 
through the coil here,

199
00:12:02,224 --> 00:12:06,571
then I have a change in magnetic flux,
and as I increase the current,

200
00:12:06,571 --> 00:12:08,498
that is the change in magnetic flux,

201
00:12:08,498 --> 00:12:13,134
then the force increases,
that is acting on the ring.

202
00:12:16,124 --> 00:12:17,526
Okay, so in this experiment

203
00:12:17,526 --> 00:12:20,943
what we're going to demonstrate here, 
is, again, the Lorentz force.

204
00:12:20,943 --> 00:12:24,774
We have a coil here, and there's 
a big capacitor underneath.

205
00:12:24,774 --> 00:12:27,747
This capacitor will be charged.
This will take some time,

206
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:30,655
and then I will release the charge
that's stored in the capacitor.

207
00:12:30,655 --> 00:12:33,666
This creates a surge of current in here,

208
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:38,239
which creates an enormous 
flux change through this coil,

209
00:12:38,239 --> 00:12:41,627
which in turn induces 
eddy currents in the Coke can,

210
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:45,889
which through the Lorentz force 
will contract and be split in two.

211
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:49,169
So we will now start charging.

212
00:12:50,930 --> 00:12:55,379
And this process takes a while,
we can see over here on the dial

213
00:12:56,559 --> 00:12:59,731
the increase we have to charge 
to roughly 10 kV.

214
00:13:10,599 --> 00:13:12,641
Okay, so we reached a steady-state.

215
00:13:12,641 --> 00:13:14,414
3, 2, 1.

216
00:13:14,414 --> 00:13:15,730
(bang)

217
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:18,702
And now if you touch this,

218
00:13:18,702 --> 00:13:22,941
you can feel that it is 
actually quite hot.

219
00:13:25,821 --> 00:13:26,861
(scanner buzzing)

220
00:13:26,861 --> 00:13:30,714
So here in this video, 
is a practical example.

221
00:13:30,714 --> 00:13:35,113
So we can hear, 
the scanner as it is going.

222
00:13:35,113 --> 00:13:37,222
And you hear bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz.

223
00:13:37,222 --> 00:13:42,664
That's the typical sound 
of an MRI experiment under progress.

224
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:44,275
(buzzing)

225
00:13:47,754 --> 00:13:50,935
So where does the sound come from
in the MRI scanner?

226
00:13:50,935 --> 00:13:56,035
And the thing here is that,
as we've seen with the experiments,

227
00:13:56,035 --> 00:14:00,685
we're looking at the Lorentz force 
of the <i>B0</i> field, let's say it's 3 T,

228
00:14:00,685 --> 00:14:02,876
so it's a very strong magnetic field,

229
00:14:02,876 --> 00:14:06,906
on rapidly switched current 
in the gradient coil.

230
00:14:07,296 --> 00:14:08,996
So this force builds up.

231
00:14:09,796 --> 00:14:14,167
Because the current 
in the gradient coil is switched rapidly,

232
00:14:14,167 --> 00:14:17,709
the force builds up rapidly, 
and this is like...

233
00:14:17,709 --> 00:14:18,790
(knocking on table)

234
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:20,423
...a hammer knocking on a structure.

235
00:14:20,423 --> 00:14:23,688
Here it's the copper structure
that hammers on its support.

236
00:14:23,688 --> 00:14:26,879
That support doesn't move 
like if you hammer on a table,

237
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,440
like this table here.

238
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:33,550
The support cannot move 
but you still have this knocking sound,

239
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:36,020
and that produces <i>very</i> strong forces,

240
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,804
The examples with the Coke can
are just mere illustrations

241
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:43,850
of the kinds of forces that are in there.

242
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:48,780
And so to give you an idea 
what we're talking about here,

243
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:53,532
one switch is typically 
100 A in about 100 μs.

244
00:14:53,532 --> 00:14:56,185
That's the kind of forces 
that we're looking at.

245
00:14:57,595 --> 00:15:02,481
Now, without engineering attempts

246
00:15:02,481 --> 00:15:04,791
to reduce the sound inside the scanner

247
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:07,354
it would be much louder,
and over the years

248
00:15:07,354 --> 00:15:11,314
the scanners have become 
considerably quieter

249
00:15:11,314 --> 00:15:14,123
than they used to be 10, 15 years ago.

250
00:15:14,123 --> 00:15:16,393
So there's continuous research going on

251
00:15:16,393 --> 00:15:19,267
and development in trying 
to reduce the noise.

252
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:25,984
But in general, it is advised 
to go into an MRI scan with the ear plugs

253
00:15:25,984 --> 00:15:32,695
so that one does not have 
some unpleasant surprises.

254
00:15:34,656 --> 00:15:38,596
Now before going into 
how the image is reconstructed,

255
00:15:38,596 --> 00:15:43,106
I want to illustrate here 
with a simple example,

256
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:47,468
I want to illustrate 
how slice-selection is achieved.

257
00:15:48,448 --> 00:15:51,366
So we have seen 
in the previous two courses

258
00:15:51,366 --> 00:15:54,317
that the radio frequency field <i>B1,</i>

259
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:59,290
which is applied at a frequency <i>ω_RF,</i>

260
00:16:00,930 --> 00:16:03,420
it is capable of exciting
the magnetization

261
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:04,850
into the transverse plane

262
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:08,799
if <i>ω_RF</i> matches the Larmor frequency

263
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:11,100
of the precession of the magnetization.

264
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:14,143
So if <i>ω_RF</i> is equal to <i>ω_L</i>

265
00:16:14,143 --> 00:16:17,751
then one is capable of flipping 
the magnetization

266
00:16:17,751 --> 00:16:20,171
into the transverse plane.

267
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:23,122
What we're looking at here now, is a cube.

268
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:27,580
If you consider this part of an object,

269
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:31,303
it's a 7x7x4 matrix

270
00:16:31,303 --> 00:16:34,923
and each of these voxels contains
the magnetization vector.

271
00:16:35,413 --> 00:16:40,774
We have the z direction here,

272
00:16:41,274 --> 00:16:42,913
we have the x direction,

273
00:16:42,913 --> 00:16:45,464
and we have the direction in y.

274
00:16:47,134 --> 00:16:51,696
Now we'll consider that we are here
and that we have a position <i>z0</i>

275
00:16:51,696 --> 00:16:56,994
that corresponds to
the gray voxels here in our object,

276
00:16:57,374 --> 00:17:02,008
and we consider that 
the Larmor frequency at this position

277
00:17:02,008 --> 00:17:06,380
is given by <i>γ B0 + γ Gz</i> times <i>z0.</i>

278
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:08,807
So the Larmor frequency is equal to that,

279
00:17:08,807 --> 00:17:12,622
then if we set the <i>ω_RF</i>
equal to that Larmor frequency,

280
00:17:12,622 --> 00:17:15,877
then we are capable 
of flipping the magnetization

281
00:17:15,877 --> 00:17:17,976
into the transverse plane.

282
00:17:18,556 --> 00:17:21,820
This is done on-resonance, 
as we have seen,

283
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:27,869
that the magnetization 
that is off-resonance, that precesses,

284
00:17:27,869 --> 00:17:31,400
is not touched by the RF pulse, 
by the <i>B1</i> field,

285
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,980
but only those that are on-resonance,

286
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:34,800
so in our rotating frame,

287
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,450
which is always set to 
the frequency of the <i>B1</i> field,

288
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:46,639
this magnetization can be flipped
into the transverse plane.

289
00:17:48,489 --> 00:17:50,623
So in this case, we can see 
that the magnetization

290
00:17:50,623 --> 00:17:53,482
that corresponds to the gray voxels,

291
00:17:53,482 --> 00:17:56,492
applying an RF field with this condition,
will flip the magnetization

292
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:00,033
transverse plane for all the gray voxels,
and the others are untouched.

293
00:18:00,483 --> 00:18:02,902
And then it becomes a simple fact,

294
00:18:02,902 --> 00:18:07,223
a simple means of changing 
the frequency of the synthesizer

295
00:18:07,223 --> 00:18:10,003
to change the frequency of the RF field,

296
00:18:10,003 --> 00:18:12,364
and that alters the position of the slice.

297
00:18:12,724 --> 00:18:14,589
So here's now in 
the rotating reference frame,

298
00:18:14,589 --> 00:18:16,405
so this term does not appear.

299
00:18:16,405 --> 00:18:19,626
The <i>ω_RF</i> equals <i>γ Gz</i> times <i>z,</i>

300
00:18:20,296 --> 00:18:23,495
and then we select, in our object,
this slice here.

301
00:18:23,495 --> 00:18:26,854
And now if we change 
the frequency of the synthesizer,

302
00:18:26,854 --> 00:18:29,085
we will change the position of the slice,

303
00:18:29,085 --> 00:18:32,128
and as we see here in this animation,

304
00:18:32,128 --> 00:18:37,786
it moves up and down with position
as we change the frequency.

305
00:18:40,266 --> 00:18:43,326
Here I would like to make a side point
and that is, which is important,

306
00:18:43,326 --> 00:18:45,527
we should not confuse two things.

307
00:18:46,127 --> 00:18:51,466
Typically we refer to x and y,
to their positions in real space,

308
00:18:51,466 --> 00:18:53,289
so z is this direction,

309
00:18:53,289 --> 00:18:54,729
x is typically this direction,

310
00:18:54,729 --> 00:18:57,005
and y is typically this direction.

311
00:18:58,195 --> 00:19:01,640
<i>Mxy</i> or <i>M</i> or <i>M_perpendicular</i>

312
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:04,888
refers to the transverse magnetization.

313
00:19:04,888 --> 00:19:07,901
Here, x and y denote 
the transverse components

314
00:19:07,901 --> 00:19:09,791
in magnetization space.

315
00:19:10,151 --> 00:19:12,401
So this is different than real space.

316
00:19:12,401 --> 00:19:14,730
If we put ourselves into 
a rotating reference frame,

317
00:19:14,730 --> 00:19:18,562
we do that in magnetization space,
and not in real space,

318
00:19:18,562 --> 00:19:22,562
and we're dealing here 
with two different coordinate systems.

319
00:19:23,772 --> 00:19:26,672
However, they do share the z component.

320
00:19:27,522 --> 00:19:29,977
So this is important 
that we keep that in mind

321
00:19:30,957 --> 00:19:33,893
for the rest of this course.
