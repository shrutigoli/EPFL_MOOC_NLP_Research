1
00:00:04,257 --> 00:00:06,588
So now the question is
what is the basic principle

2
00:00:06,588 --> 00:00:09,159
of encoding spatial information?

3
00:00:09,969 --> 00:00:13,249
We have during detection, 
in the presence of a gradient,

4
00:00:13,249 --> 00:00:18,021
we have a spatially varying 
resonance frequency.

5
00:00:18,021 --> 00:00:24,892
So the <i>z</i> field is equal to 
<i>B0 + Gx</i> times <i>x. </i>

6
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:28,074
And so if we plot this as a function of <i>x,</i>

7
00:00:28,074 --> 00:00:29,931
we have a magnetic field here,

8
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:30,933
and here.

9
00:00:30,933 --> 00:00:36,573
It increases, et cetera,
so that's <i>γ Bz(x).</i>

10
00:00:36,573 --> 00:00:40,643
Our transverse magnetization 
now will precess, it will be given by

11
00:00:40,643 --> 00:00:46,707
the transverse magnetization
at position <i>x</i> times <i>e^(i γ Bz)</i> times <i>t.</i>

12
00:00:48,917 --> 00:00:52,266
So this is in general terms,
this is how this is written here.

13
00:00:52,266 --> 00:00:55,650
We have the <i>B0</i> term 
and we have the gradient term.

14
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:58,365
Now what we'll do is we'll put ourselves
into the rotating frame

15
00:00:58,365 --> 00:01:01,996
to describe that so that 
we don't need to consider the <i>γ B0.</i>

16
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:06,264
Remember, <i>γ B0</i> is much bigger 
than <i>γ Gx</i> times <i>x,</i>

17
00:01:06,264 --> 00:01:11,905
so we have now just 
a magnetic field that varies with <i>x,</i>

18
00:01:11,905 --> 00:01:13,151
so it's the <i>z</i> component.

19
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:16,608
So now we can write the precession
of the transverse magnetization,

20
00:01:16,608 --> 00:01:18,097
given by the transverse magnetization

21
00:01:18,097 --> 00:01:22,990
at position <i>x</i>
times <i>e^(i γ Gx.x)</i> times time.

22
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:25,284
So if we look here at this position,

23
00:01:25,284 --> 00:01:28,238
our magnetization vector will precess here

24
00:01:28,238 --> 00:01:30,887
with a certain precessional frequency.

25
00:01:30,887 --> 00:01:34,181
If you go at this position, 
the magnetic field is stronger

26
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:37,270
so here, it's precessing faster.

27
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:43,029
And finally, at this position we have 
an even stronger magnetic field

28
00:01:43,029 --> 00:01:46,200
and here the magnetization 
precesses faster.

29
00:01:47,150 --> 00:01:49,212
So this is what we are detecting.

30
00:01:49,212 --> 00:01:52,739
We have precessed 
different precessional frequencies

31
00:01:52,739 --> 00:01:57,816
and they depend on the position
of the magnetization.

32
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:00,391
Now the signal that one detects

33
00:02:00,391 --> 00:02:04,275
is given by the sum 
of all precessing magnetization.

34
00:02:04,275 --> 00:02:08,244
So what we now have to do is
to get the signal as a function of time,

35
00:02:08,244 --> 00:02:12,175
we have to integrate 
over the object, here along <i>x,</i>

36
00:02:12,175 --> 00:02:15,745
the magnetization 
at time zero at a position <i>x,</i>

37
00:02:15,745 --> 00:02:20,716
times the evolution term here,
so that's the phase evolution.

38
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:24,273
And here we're basically saying that
the real part is, for example,

39
00:02:24,273 --> 00:02:27,426
corresponds to the <i>x</i> component
of the transverse magnetization

40
00:02:27,426 --> 00:02:29,635
at the imaginary, the <i>y</i> component.

41
00:02:29,635 --> 00:02:34,057
So we'll do this integration
over position.

42
00:02:37,147 --> 00:02:41,549
So what does this equation resemble?

43
00:02:43,131 --> 00:02:46,396
Have you seen a similar equation already?

44
00:02:48,752 --> 00:02:50,129
Does it ring a bell?

45
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,460
How about this equation,
does that ring a bell?

46
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:59,209
You have most likely come across
this type of equation,

47
00:02:59,209 --> 00:03:01,650
and that's an inverse Fourier transform.

48
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,442
Essentially looking at a signal 
that we are detecting,

49
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:10,297
is the inverse Fourier transform
of the magnetization

50
00:03:11,577 --> 00:03:14,940
as a function of frequency,
and here frequency and position,

51
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:18,215
they are linked through this equation, 
linearly linked through that.

52
00:03:18,215 --> 00:03:20,031
So this is a Fourier transformation

53
00:03:20,031 --> 00:03:25,005
of the object's magnetization
that we detect.

54
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:28,954
So we can rewrite this equation
that we have here.

55
00:03:28,954 --> 00:03:31,373
I'll write it as S(k),

56
00:03:31,373 --> 00:03:35,495
which is proportional to the integral 
over the object magnetization

57
00:03:35,495 --> 00:03:40,477
again at time zero times <i>e^(i k x) dx.</i>

58
00:03:42,776 --> 00:03:45,757
And here we're using 
the term <i>k</i> for k-space,

59
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:50,888
this is the conjugate 
or pair variable to position <i>x,</i>

60
00:03:50,888 --> 00:03:55,757
so here <i>x</i> and <i>k</i> are linked
through Fourier transformation,

61
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:57,217
they are a Fourier pair,

62
00:03:57,217 --> 00:04:00,729
like in this example, 
<i>ω</i> and <i>t</i> are the Fourier pair.

63
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:03,738
So if we take now 
the Fourier transformation

64
00:04:03,738 --> 00:04:05,819
of the signal that we record with time,

65
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:09,966
or, we can also say as, 
that we record as a function of k-space,

66
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:14,102
this gives us the magnetization along <i>x.</i>

67
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:17,750
If we write this now for a 2D object,

68
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:22,468
then the magnetization at 
a given position <i>x</i> that we observe,

69
00:04:22,468 --> 00:04:26,642
so we obtain Fourier transformation
of this, we obtain <i>M(x),</i>

70
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:30,343
and this <i>M(x),</i> if we look at 
the two-dimensional object,

71
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:34,865
is then given by the integral 
of the magnetization in <i>(x, y)</i> along <i>y,</i>

72
00:04:34,865 --> 00:04:38,194
because we cannot distinguish, 
in the <i>y</i> direction, the position

73
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:41,153
if we apply a gradient along <i>x.</i>

74
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:44,213
Now this equation, 
does that look familiar?

75
00:04:46,043 --> 00:04:49,833
You have certainly seen it 
in the first part of this course.

76
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,325
We have introduced it 
for computed tomography

77
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:55,504
and this is a Radon transform.

78
00:04:55,504 --> 00:04:57,635
So in principle I could stop here and say,

79
00:04:57,635 --> 00:05:00,715
"Well, once," like I've said before,
"once we see that the signal

80
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:03,104
corresponds to that of a Radon transform,

81
00:05:03,104 --> 00:05:08,946
we know we can reconstruct 
an image with that projection."

82
00:05:09,372 --> 00:05:12,445
So in principle the reconstruction
can be done here,

83
00:05:12,445 --> 00:05:14,408
as in computed tomography.

84
00:05:14,838 --> 00:05:19,698
However, this is not the general case

85
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:22,356
and I will not stop here
the lecture for this week,

86
00:05:22,356 --> 00:05:28,524
and we will go into the way
that the images are reconstructed.

87
00:05:29,526 --> 00:05:32,709
So first I want to come with a 1D example.

88
00:05:32,709 --> 00:05:36,109
And we'll take here, the example 
of two point-like objects,

89
00:05:36,109 --> 00:05:39,341
these could be capillaries, 
so they are very small dimension.

90
00:05:39,341 --> 00:05:40,591
Here they are.

91
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:43,806
We'll give the position along <i>x</i> here,

92
00:05:43,806 --> 00:05:45,320
and without encoding,

93
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,717
that is the magnetic field 
which is plotted here,

94
00:05:47,717 --> 00:05:49,701
is constant in position.

95
00:05:49,701 --> 00:05:52,062
We have a constant 
magnetic field in position,

96
00:05:52,062 --> 00:05:56,934
and we'll record a nice 
free induction decaying signal.

97
00:05:56,934 --> 00:06:01,051
The frequency is the Larmor frequency,
and the decay is T2.

98
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:04,952
Now, if we apply encoding, 
then the magnetic field varies

99
00:06:04,952 --> 00:06:06,174
linearly with space,

100
00:06:06,174 --> 00:06:08,813
and we'll take here the encoding along <i>x,</i>

101
00:06:08,813 --> 00:06:11,265
so we have applied a gradient along <i>x,</i>

102
00:06:11,265 --> 00:06:14,274
so it's a spatially varying 
magnetic field,

103
00:06:14,684 --> 00:06:18,893
and this produces now, 
an oscillation of two frequencies.

104
00:06:18,893 --> 00:06:21,325
We have two capillaries, two positions,

105
00:06:21,325 --> 00:06:22,625
we'll assume they're point-like

106
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:25,205
so they're two
very well-defined frequencies.

107
00:06:25,205 --> 00:06:27,828
This is gives a beating pattern 
of two frequencies,

108
00:06:27,828 --> 00:06:30,757
and that typically looks like this.

109
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:33,806
Now if you imagine you have
a more complex object,

110
00:06:33,806 --> 00:06:37,858
it is not so obvious just to see 
from the signal that's recorded,

111
00:06:37,858 --> 00:06:40,299
what is being observed.

112
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:44,343
So what is done now is we apply 
the Fourier transformation,

113
00:06:44,343 --> 00:06:48,336
that is we decompose the signal
into its frequency components.

114
00:06:48,336 --> 00:06:50,972
That's what Fourier transformation 
does for you.

115
00:06:51,422 --> 00:06:53,969
So we'll take the signal, 
Fourier transform it.

116
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:56,608
Here we get a single resonance.

117
00:06:56,608 --> 00:06:58,358
We have a constant magnetic field,

118
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:00,400
we have no information on the position,

119
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,861
and in the presence of 
a spatially varying magnetic field,

120
00:07:03,861 --> 00:07:07,630
we're getting two peaks,
two resonance positions

121
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:11,062
two frequencies according to the position

122
00:07:11,062 --> 00:07:14,641
of these two capillaries in this example.

123
00:07:15,161 --> 00:07:19,412
And so these projections 
that we obtain, like I've said before,

124
00:07:19,412 --> 00:07:24,871
we could, in principle, reconstruct
the image using back projection.

125
00:07:24,871 --> 00:07:27,125
And this was indeed, 
in the very first experiment

126
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:32,454
done by Paul Lauterbur, 
a physical chemist, in the early '70s,

127
00:07:32,454 --> 00:07:35,552
this is actually how 
he produced the first images.

128
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:38,455
He used MRI with back projection.

129
00:07:38,865 --> 00:07:43,053
The other person that is 
noteworthy to mention,

130
00:07:43,053 --> 00:07:45,504
also in the early '70s, 
that took a different approach,

131
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:48,554
that was a physicist, Sir Peter Mansfield.

132
00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:52,847
Paul Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield,
they shared the Nobel Prize

133
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:57,470
in Physiology and Medicine in 2003,
for their groundbreaking work

134
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:03,806
in making imaging possible
with magnetic resonance.
