1
00:00:05,285 --> 00:00:08,905
Let's look at how this spacial information

2
00:00:08,905 --> 00:00:10,315
is encoded in MRI.

3
00:00:12,019 --> 00:00:13,790
We have introduced the fact

4
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:17,310
that we are scanning Fourier, 
or reciprocal space, or k-space.

5
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:20,933
This is the frequency direction along <i>x</i>--

6
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:26,305
I'll use the same variables and along <i>y</i>,
the phasing code direction.

7
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:28,900
So, along <i>x</i> we are looking 
at the gradient here.

8
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:31,236
We are not going to bother again 
with the dephasing

9
00:00:31,236 --> 00:00:33,506
and rephasing, or the echo,

10
00:00:33,506 --> 00:00:36,841
we are just going 
to simplify here the diagram,

11
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:39,461
and we have the phasing code gradient.

12
00:00:39,461 --> 00:00:42,790
This is our sample signal 
that we have here,

13
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,906
we are acquiring at this point.

14
00:00:44,906 --> 00:00:49,716
So, if we apply the phasing code gradient,
then we have a <i>ky</i> that's non-zero,

15
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:54,299
and we will encode <i>kx</i>
according to time here.

16
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:55,879
So these are the points in <i>kx</i>.

17
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:57,982
So we have acquired here one line

18
00:00:57,982 --> 00:01:00,890
in k-space, or reciprocal space.

19
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:03,482
We will repeat it 
with a different amplitude

20
00:01:03,482 --> 00:01:04,963
for the <i>y</i> gradient;

21
00:01:04,963 --> 00:01:09,363
then we encode the second line of k-space

22
00:01:09,363 --> 00:01:12,678
so the gradient is reduced, 
so <i>ky</i> is reduced;

23
00:01:13,043 --> 00:01:14,324
the third line,

24
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:17,495
and each time this is stored in 
a two dimensional matrix;

25
00:01:18,124 --> 00:01:22,571
fourth line, fifth line, sixth line

26
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,120
seventh, eighth, et cetera, 
and as we acquire this.

27
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,793
And then we do this much faster,
and this is the sound that you hear:

28
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:32,843
"Bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz, bzz,..."

29
00:01:33,893 --> 00:01:35,728
As you hear the sound from the MRI,

30
00:01:35,728 --> 00:01:39,478
this is how the k-space matrix 
is being filled up.

31
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:44,072
So, we don't have here the RF pulse--
we have not drawn this

32
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:48,972
but, of course, we have an RF pulse, 
each time that we have to apply.

33
00:01:49,344 --> 00:01:52,653
And so this means, 
we have one line of k-space

34
00:01:52,653 --> 00:01:57,603
that's been acquired per <i>T R</i>,
<i>T R</i> being the time between RF pulses.

35
00:01:57,613 --> 00:02:02,713
<i>T R</i>, as we have seen, is determined 
by the longitudinal relaxation time,

36
00:02:02,713 --> 00:02:06,593
so it is typically 
on the order of seconds.

37
00:02:06,797 --> 00:02:11,237
The acquisition here, this is typically 
on the order of milliseconds.

38
00:02:11,237 --> 00:02:15,497
So this is very fast done--
these data points are fast acquired,

39
00:02:15,497 --> 00:02:18,937
and here every line 
is acquired every <i>T R</i> seconds.

40
00:02:19,352 --> 00:02:23,433
So, if we are looking for a 256^2 matrix,

41
00:02:23,433 --> 00:02:26,543
the re-dimension is in milliseconds--
that does not count--

42
00:02:26,543 --> 00:02:29,053
but if we have 256 phasing code directions

43
00:02:29,053 --> 00:02:33,453
and we take typically <i>T1</i> of one second,
our <i>T R</i> is on the order of seconds.

44
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:39,113
Then an image 256^2 matrix, 
it takes roughly four minutes

45
00:02:39,133 --> 00:02:41,178
to acquire that data.

46
00:02:43,376 --> 00:02:48,315
Conclusion: MR scans are long 
and motion-sensitive.

47
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:54,160
They are long because the acquisition 
has in large part to do with <i>T1</i>.

48
00:02:54,162 --> 00:02:56,506
<i>T1</i> is not very short,

49
00:02:56,506 --> 00:03:02,656
and motion-sensitive because every time 
you acquire a k-space line here,

50
00:03:02,761 --> 00:03:05,271
you acquire information 
on the entire object.

51
00:03:05,574 --> 00:03:09,268
If this part of the matrix does not fir
this part of the matrix,

52
00:03:09,268 --> 00:03:12,410
then, of course, 
they don't reconstruct very well,

53
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:17,261
and this produces a mismatch

54
00:03:17,261 --> 00:03:20,527
and therefore motion artifacts.

55
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:25,861
So, here is an example of a subject 
that moved during acquisition.

56
00:03:25,862 --> 00:03:28,742
[inaudible] this is a sagittal cut, 
the nose is here,

57
00:03:28,742 --> 00:03:30,872
the brainstem is here, 
so this is the brain

58
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:34,542
and you can see here these bright areas,
here these streaking artifacts,

59
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:38,954
one has so called ghosting,

60
00:03:38,954 --> 00:03:42,844
so that signal that does not belong
where it is being observed--

61
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:45,214
there is no signal outside of the head--

62
00:03:45,214 --> 00:03:48,116
or ringing artifacts 
that are being observed.

63
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:58,114
So, there are few things we can say 
about the image matrix.

64
00:03:58,184 --> 00:04:02,468
So, the maximum <i>kx</i> or <i>ky</i>
that one acquires,

65
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:05,361
that determines the resolution,

66
00:04:06,722 --> 00:04:09,830
and the increment, the <i>Δ k</i>,

67
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:14,660
that is either <i>Δ kx</i> or <i>Δ ky</i>,

68
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,530
through the Nyquist theorem 
determines the field of view.

69
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:24,684
So if we have closely spaced samples, 
then one gets a big field of view,

70
00:04:24,684 --> 00:04:29,496
if one has a lot of samples, 
one gets a high spatial resolution.

71
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:33,954
So, this whole process,
since what has been acquired,

72
00:04:33,954 --> 00:04:36,094
is the Fourier transform of the object.

73
00:04:36,094 --> 00:04:42,464
In this process of image reconstruction 
there is no influence on the resolution.

74
00:04:42,464 --> 00:04:44,900
The resolution is uniform 
across the entire image

75
00:04:45,134 --> 00:04:49,025
and also the sensitivity as such, 
once a signal is acquired,

76
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:54,725
the reconstruction process 
induces a uniform sensitivity.

77
00:04:55,652 --> 00:04:58,715
So, in principle we could acquire an image

78
00:04:58,715 --> 00:05:05,729
with 8,192 pixels in one direction, 
and 8,192 pixels in the other direction--

79
00:05:06,015 --> 00:05:10,515
we are not limited 
from the acquisition process

80
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:14,115
to the size of the matrix.

81
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:20,821
However, the limitation that we encounter 
is the voxel magnetization.

82
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:27,952
As we have seen a few weeks ago,
the sensitivity is maximal

83
00:05:27,952 --> 00:05:30,096
for thermodynamic 
equilibrium magnetization,

84
00:05:30,282 --> 00:05:37,562
and that is determined 
by the magnetization in the voxel--

85
00:05:37,562 --> 00:05:39,694
that's the number of molecules et cetera,

86
00:05:39,694 --> 00:05:42,014
so there is the fundamental limit.

87
00:05:44,239 --> 00:05:48,389
We have in the k-space matrix 
we have one particular point to consider,

88
00:05:48,568 --> 00:05:51,598
and that's where <i>kx</i> and <i>ky</i>
are equal to zero--

89
00:05:51,781 --> 00:05:53,946
that's the center of k-space.

90
00:05:54,961 --> 00:05:57,678
At this point <i>kx</i> and <i>ky</i> are zero

91
00:05:57,678 --> 00:06:01,798
and this point is of particular interest--

92
00:06:01,798 --> 00:06:04,798
that's where the image is maximal--

93
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:08,654
we have no dephasing in any direction 
of the magnetization.

94
00:06:09,789 --> 00:06:15,279
Let's look at the properties 
of the k-space matrix.

95
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,270
Here is an image of an MRI,

96
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:21,830
the data acquired 
at 512 x 512 spatial resolution,

97
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,110
that's the reconstructed image,

98
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,890
that's the 2D Fourier transform, 
that's x, y space,

99
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:30,580
and this is k-space here, <i>kx</i>, <i>ky</i>.

100
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:36,550
If we now take the center eight points, 
eight by eight,

101
00:06:36,665 --> 00:06:40,001
and reconstruct this, 
we are getting a very blurry image.

102
00:06:40,485 --> 00:06:43,345
If we take the image and we eliminate 
those central eight points,

103
00:06:43,345 --> 00:06:47,865
we get more or less 
sharper features of the object.

104
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:50,084
We do the same thing now

105
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:53,014
with just taking 
the first 16 points at the center,

106
00:06:53,014 --> 00:06:58,494
reconstruct, and here we eliminate 
the central 16 x 16 points,

107
00:06:58,494 --> 00:07:00,599
and we are starting to see the edges here

108
00:07:00,599 --> 00:07:03,362
and here we are starting to see 
some of the structure.

109
00:07:04,483 --> 00:07:08,453
32 x 32, and it's already quite amazing 
how much contrast we have

110
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:10,733
at this point, 32 x 32,

111
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,633
that's a very small matrix 
compared to 512.

112
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:17,852
We are starting to see already structures 
here, in this brain scan,

113
00:07:17,852 --> 00:07:21,170
and eliminating the first central 32 points

114
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:24,190
gives edge features.

115
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,643
Now, the one thing 
that we have to bear in mind

116
00:07:29,643 --> 00:07:34,633
is that the center k-space point
determines the contrast of the image.

117
00:07:35,113 --> 00:07:37,621
And this comes from the center 
of the k-space,

118
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:40,601
that's S (0, 0), <i>kx</i>, <i>ky = 0</i>,

119
00:07:40,981 --> 00:07:43,661
is given by this expression here

120
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:46,891
with <i>kx = 0</i> and <i>ky = 0</i>.

121
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:49,454
So this is the Fourier transform 
of the magnetization--

122
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:51,324
that's what we are detecting.

123
00:07:51,914 --> 00:07:54,746
If we look at the discrete 
Fourier transformation,

124
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:59,944
and the discrete Fourier transformation
we employ the fact here

125
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:04,704
that it is periodic 
over the sample time period

126
00:08:04,704 --> 00:08:06,734
and we can do a time shift.

127
00:08:06,734 --> 00:08:10,464
With a time shift--so here is the signal--
that's the echo that we record

128
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:14,256
we can in the discrete 
Fourier transformation

129
00:08:14,256 --> 00:08:17,056
this signal is going to be 
the same signal here

130
00:08:17,056 --> 00:08:18,816
in that magnitude as this signal,

131
00:08:18,816 --> 00:08:21,246
so we've taken this half, 
shifted it to the left

132
00:08:21,246 --> 00:08:23,866
and that half, as we shift, 
we fold it around

133
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:25,486
and put it on this side.

134
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:27,578
And now we have seen,

135
00:08:29,786 --> 00:08:31,706
before, for the Fourier transformation,

136
00:08:31,706 --> 00:08:33,186
that the signal at time zero

137
00:08:33,186 --> 00:08:35,476
is proportional to the magnetization.

138
00:08:35,476 --> 00:08:38,994
Here is our time signal, zero, 
so this signal here

139
00:08:38,994 --> 00:08:41,124
is proportional to the magnetization

140
00:08:41,124 --> 00:08:47,914
and therefore is proportional 
to equilibrium magnetization

141
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:50,375
and the effects of relaxation.

142
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:55,100
Okay, et's go on; we have 64 x 64, 
the image gets sharper

143
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:01,020
and we are getting more and more,
outside of the 64 x 64

144
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,036
are very sharp features, 
the high frequency component,

145
00:09:04,036 --> 00:09:08,916
128 x 128, really now only 
seen the sharp edges

146
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:13,806
and here the image is almost 
the same quality as this image here,

147
00:09:13,806 --> 00:09:16,475
and we are left with very sharp features.

148
00:09:16,842 --> 00:09:19,494
So, what this means 
in terms of data acquisition,

149
00:09:19,942 --> 00:09:22,462
if your subject moves here

150
00:09:23,582 --> 00:09:26,172
close to the central k-space points

151
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:29,172
you are going to have 
a very big impact on the image,

152
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,840
whereas, if it moves here at the edges,

153
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,170
where there is 
a very little signal out here,

154
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,840
the impact is much less.

155
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:40,530
So crossing through zero k-space point 
defines a contrast

156
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:43,880
and also the magnitude 
of the motion artifacts.

157
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:49,596
I want to summarize the spatial encoding 
with the gradients.

158
00:09:51,154 --> 00:09:55,374
I'll try here a depiction that is more
on a mathematical basis.

159
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:58,785
So, we will have here the RF pulse--

160
00:09:58,785 --> 00:10:01,585
that's done by the <i>B1</i>.

161
00:10:01,585 --> 00:10:04,005
We have a flip angle <i>α</i>,

162
00:10:04,005 --> 00:10:05,885
and we will look now 
at the magnetization

163
00:10:05,885 --> 00:10:08,735
at the time point specified, 
magnetization at time one.

164
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:10,845
That's just <i>z</i> magnetization.

165
00:10:11,759 --> 00:10:15,929
This is being rotated by the <i>RF</i> pulse 
by <i>α</i> degree about <i>x</i>,

166
00:10:15,929 --> 00:10:18,238
so at the time point two

167
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:24,178
we have rotating about <i>x</i>
in rotating plane,

168
00:10:24,178 --> 00:10:28,508
so the <i>y</i> component is <i>Mz sin α</i>

169
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:31,738
and the <i>z</i> component is <i>Mz cos α</i>.

170
00:10:31,738 --> 00:10:34,648
And now we'll just be interested 
in what's happening in transverse plane,

171
00:10:34,648 --> 00:10:39,948
so we'll forget about 
the longitudinal component.

172
00:10:39,948 --> 00:10:43,140
We'll just consider now 
the transverse magnetization.

173
00:10:44,049 --> 00:10:47,889
This transverse magnetization will precess
depending on the gradient

174
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:52,160
with <i>γ Gy y</i> or <i>γ Gx x</i>.

175
00:10:52,349 --> 00:10:55,459
So the precessional frequency here

176
00:10:55,459 --> 00:11:01,109
is given by <i>γ (B0 + G (t) ･ r)</i>.

177
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:03,687
So I will take the gradient along <i>y</i>,

178
00:11:04,356 --> 00:11:06,846
we'll apply it here 
for a certain amount of time,

179
00:11:06,846 --> 00:11:10,186
with an amplitude of <i>n Δ Gy</i>,

180
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:14,186
and we have the gradient along <i>y</i>, 
first applied negative.

181
00:11:14,593 --> 00:11:16,760
We will define here the time points,

182
00:11:17,863 --> 00:11:20,827
we will define this time point, 
number three,

183
00:11:21,513 --> 00:11:24,353
and this duration 
between two and three shall be <i>τ</i>.

184
00:11:25,153 --> 00:11:28,433
So, at this time point between 
two and three

185
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:32,540
the magnetization in the transverse plane,
we're just looking at the traverse plane,

186
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,456
is the <i>My</i> magnetization that we had here,
this magnetization,

187
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:39,763
times <i>sin</i> of the phase

188
00:11:40,861 --> 00:11:44,751
and for the <i>x</i> component

189
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:49,899
and for the <i>y</i> component <i>cos</i> of the phase--
that we have here.

190
00:11:50,277 --> 00:11:54,427
So, this is the phase <i>x</i>,

191
00:11:54,427 --> 00:12:02,077
so if we take influence of the gradient

192
00:12:02,294 --> 00:12:04,454
we will call this phase.

193
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:09,764
So, now we will have the inverted gradient,

194
00:12:09,764 --> 00:12:14,224
so now the B field becomes <i>+ γ Gx x</i>.

195
00:12:14,224 --> 00:12:19,946
During this time we have the precession 
according to the position in our area

196
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:23,276
and so we will have a rotation,

197
00:12:23,604 --> 00:12:29,574
so rotation of the magnetization along <i>x</i>
by an angle <i>+ Φx</i>.

198
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:32,404
So, what we have here 
we have written here--

199
00:12:32,404 --> 00:12:34,648
we have not considered 
the effect of the <i>y</i> gradient,

200
00:12:35,084 --> 00:12:37,446
just considered the effect of <i>x</i> gradient.

201
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:40,364
This gives the rotation by <i>- Φx</i>.

202
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:43,154
If we have now inversion 
of the polarity of the gradient,

203
00:12:43,154 --> 00:12:46,404
this rotates the magnetization 
by an angle <i>+ Φx</i>.

204
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:51,481
So, this gives us 
a maximal signal at <i>TE = 2 τ</i>

205
00:12:51,481 --> 00:12:52,627
that's this time here.

206
00:12:53,281 --> 00:12:58,291
And we'll assume here for this argument 
that <i>Δ G y = 2 0</i>.

207
00:13:01,288 --> 00:13:03,828
And now we are looking 
at the fourth time point.

208
00:13:04,488 --> 00:13:10,231
For <i>Δ G y = 0</i>
the magnetization is now given

209
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:14,611
by <i>Mz sin α</i> for the <i>y</i> component

210
00:13:14,611 --> 00:13:17,389
and <i>Mz cos α</i> for the <i>z</i> component,

211
00:13:17,389 --> 00:13:20,042
where we have echo formation.

212
00:13:20,042 --> 00:13:22,682
So, we can work in these equations

213
00:13:24,082 --> 00:13:31,112
fully for the mathematically 
for the effect of the gradients.

214
00:13:33,142 --> 00:13:38,852
Now, the signal at time <i>τ</i> or <i>t</i>

215
00:13:39,824 --> 00:13:41,664
it is for the phasing code gradient,

216
00:13:41,664 --> 00:13:43,824
we have the influence 
of the phasing code gradient,

217
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:48,944
magnetization at the start and influence 
of the [inaudible] gradient,

218
00:13:48,944 --> 00:13:51,370
so we have <i>T</i> here, <i>τ</i> here

219
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:55,670
so it's <i>τ +T</i> is the influence 
of the gradient,

220
00:13:55,670 --> 00:14:01,346
and we can rewrite this 
as the signal in k-space,

221
00:14:01,346 --> 00:14:04,986
again, with appropriate 
variable transformation.

222
00:14:05,236 --> 00:14:10,016
So mathematically MRI--
this is the key take-home message--

223
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,926
MRI measures the 2D 
Fourier transformation of the object.

224
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:15,859
That's what is being registered.

225
00:14:16,682 --> 00:14:20,682
What is also key is that measuring 
the second spatial dimension,

226
00:14:20,682 --> 00:14:26,892
that requires time, and this time 
is strongly influenced by <i>T1</i> [at hand],

227
00:14:26,892 --> 00:14:29,868
which are typically 
on the order of seconds.

228
00:14:31,106 --> 00:14:34,686
So, this is very complicated, 
I understand,

229
00:14:34,686 --> 00:14:38,089
so understanding phase encoding 
is not a very easy topic.

230
00:14:39,089 --> 00:14:43,349
We will try to rehash 
the process of phase encoding

231
00:14:43,349 --> 00:14:47,349
under a different perspective 
at the beginning of next week

232
00:14:47,349 --> 00:14:49,869
to look at this 
with a slightly different optic

233
00:14:49,869 --> 00:14:52,404
so we can digest this factor 
and understand

234
00:14:52,404 --> 00:14:56,067
how spacial information is being encoded.
