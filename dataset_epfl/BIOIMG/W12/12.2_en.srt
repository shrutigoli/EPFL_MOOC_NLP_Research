1
00:00:04,214 --> 00:00:09,257
So, I've introduced <i>T_2 star</i> changes,
I've introduced <i>T_2 star</i>,

2
00:00:09,257 --> 00:00:10,555
now the question is,

3
00:00:10,555 --> 00:00:15,626
how do these changes in <i>T_2 star</i>

4
00:00:15,626 --> 00:00:19,697
relate to something useful,
to some biophysical mechanism?

5
00:00:19,697 --> 00:00:22,614
Now we'll start here
with magnetic susceptibility.

6
00:00:22,614 --> 00:00:28,460
And we know from magnetism

7
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:31,450
that the magnetic in an object

8
00:00:31,450 --> 00:00:34,189
depends on the object's properties.

9
00:00:34,189 --> 00:00:36,715
So we have the magnetic field

10
00:00:36,715 --> 00:00:39,500
and the magnetic field inside the object

11
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,660
is linked to the externally applied
magnetic field <i>B_0</i>

12
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,401
through the susceptibility.

13
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:46,662
You can see this is 
multiplied by <i>10^-6</i>

14
00:00:46,662 --> 00:00:51,893
so the susceptibility here is given in ppm
so it is a relatively small effect.

15
00:00:51,893 --> 00:00:54,893
And the major effects
that we're looking at

16
00:00:54,893 --> 00:00:58,191
is diamagnetism, that's a repelling force,

17
00:00:58,191 --> 00:01:01,014
and paramagnetism,
which is an attracting force--

18
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:05,886
it has to do with interactions between
the atoms and the external magnetic field.

19
00:01:07,776 --> 00:01:10,266
So here I want to illustrate an example.

20
00:01:10,266 --> 00:01:13,487
This is a levitating strawberry,

21
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:16,857
it's placed on a strong magnet--
permanent magnet--

22
00:01:16,857 --> 00:01:19,247
that is very inhomogeneous,

23
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:22,519
and the strawberry is primarily water
so it's diamagnetic

24
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:28,080
and so it levitates in air here
as you can see on this video from YouTube.

25
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,210
Here's another example.

26
00:01:31,210 --> 00:01:33,771
And that is a Canadian frog

27
00:01:33,771 --> 00:01:37,931
that is also placed
on top of a strong magnet field,

28
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,052
the frog is very light

29
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:43,713
so it has the same repelling force
as the strawberry,

30
00:01:43,713 --> 00:01:45,533
and about a comparable weight,

31
00:01:45,533 --> 00:01:48,963
so this animal is floating
on top of the magnet.

32
00:01:48,963 --> 00:01:50,883
We could of course ask the question,

33
00:01:50,883 --> 00:01:53,205
at what point
are we able to levitate humans,

34
00:01:53,205 --> 00:01:59,077
but this is more of an academic interest
than of reality, what we want to do.

35
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:05,078
So these are the effects on
two living examples

36
00:02:05,078 --> 00:02:07,428
from life sciences.

37
00:02:07,428 --> 00:02:11,158
In the following experiments
that I will be showing,

38
00:02:11,158 --> 00:02:14,711
I will be showing you the effect,
the levitation effect,

39
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:18,971
then we'll look at --

40
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:23,311
the effect on fluids

41
00:02:23,311 --> 00:02:25,220
in a magnet as it's turned on,

42
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:28,342
and finally, what we're going to be seeing

43
00:02:28,342 --> 00:02:33,894
is the difference between
molecular oxygen and nitrogen--

44
00:02:33,894 --> 00:02:36,825
that molecular oxygen is paragmagnetic

45
00:02:36,825 --> 00:02:41,275
and nitrogen is diamagnetic
just like water

46
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:46,006
and we'll see these 
three experiments just now.

47
00:02:47,686 --> 00:02:50,936
So in this experiment
what we have here is a strong magnet,

48
00:02:50,936 --> 00:02:55,156
on top of it, a diamagnetic substance
which is held down by another magnet.

49
00:02:55,156 --> 00:02:56,868
So I relieve it now

50
00:02:56,868 --> 00:02:59,848
and now you can see 
the repelling force of diamagnetism

51
00:02:59,848 --> 00:03:03,019
of the magnet on the object--

52
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,149
it is hovering in mid-air.

53
00:03:05,149 --> 00:03:07,740
So if I take here a piece of paper

54
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,501
I can easily slide it underneath,

55
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:13,892
and you can clearly see
how it is hovering on top of the magnet--

56
00:03:13,892 --> 00:03:16,243
there's no physical connection,
there's a distance.

57
00:03:16,243 --> 00:03:18,756
That's the repelling force
of diamagnetism.

58
00:03:20,186 --> 00:03:24,533
Okay, so in this experiment we have again
an electromagnet with the poles.

59
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:27,814
Between the two poles,
where the magnetic field is established,

60
00:03:27,814 --> 00:03:31,125
we have two cuvettes;
in those two cuvettes,

61
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,946
on your right side, we have water,

62
00:03:33,946 --> 00:03:38,266
and on the left side, we have
iron perchloride which is paramagnetic.

63
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:40,027
Currently the magnet is off--

64
00:03:40,027 --> 00:03:43,097
so you can see the level of the water
which is on the same level--

65
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,217
and when I turn it on,

66
00:03:45,217 --> 00:03:47,319
the magnetic field,

67
00:03:47,319 --> 00:03:50,928
the paramagnetic substance
is pulled upwards,

68
00:03:50,928 --> 00:03:54,309
much more so than the water
is pushed downwards

69
00:03:54,309 --> 00:03:56,884
because it's being repelled
by the magnetic field.

70
00:03:58,664 --> 00:04:01,391
Okay, so what we have here 
is a magnet which is on--

71
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:04,251
so it's a magnetic field
created between these two poles--

72
00:04:04,251 --> 00:04:08,762
and we'll first pour liquid nitrogen,
in this experiment,

73
00:04:08,762 --> 00:04:10,114
on top of here.

74
00:04:10,114 --> 00:04:12,024
And what you'll see is
that the liquid nitrogen

75
00:04:12,024 --> 00:04:13,243
will just fall through.

76
00:04:13,243 --> 00:04:14,994
So I'll take it now--

77
00:04:14,994 --> 00:04:18,655
and you can see the liquid nitrogen
just falls through.

78
00:04:18,655 --> 00:04:21,625
As we have seen in the course,
liquid nitrogen is diamagnetic

79
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,506
so there's no force on it.

80
00:04:23,506 --> 00:04:26,455
Now if on the other hand
I take liquid oxygen--

81
00:04:26,455 --> 00:04:29,718
I'll repeat the same experiment--

82
00:04:29,718 --> 00:04:33,948
and now we can see how 
it is being retained between the two poles

83
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:37,938
by the magnetic field--
that's the force of the magnetic field

84
00:04:37,938 --> 00:04:40,569
on the paramagnetic molecular oxygen.

85
00:04:41,499 --> 00:04:43,950
Okay.
And a similar situation arises in tissue,

86
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,520
that we have seen now
with the demonstration

87
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:50,790
with paramagnetic oxygen
and diamagnetic nitrogen.

88
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,510
We have in our tissue,
in our blood actually,

89
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:57,491
we have two types of hemoglobin:
deoxy-hemoglobin, which is paramagnetic,

90
00:04:57,491 --> 00:05:01,573
and oxy-hemoglobin, which is diamagnetic.

91
00:05:01,573 --> 00:05:05,744
This has to do with the fact whether
there's oxygen bound to the heme, iron,

92
00:05:05,744 --> 00:05:07,054
or not.

93
00:05:07,054 --> 00:05:10,305
This changes the configuration
of the electrons

94
00:05:10,305 --> 00:05:14,636
and therefore changes
whether they are para- or diamagnetic.

95
00:05:14,636 --> 00:05:17,116
So now what happens
if we are looking at a blood vessel

96
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:20,237
that's put into
an external field <i>B_0</i> like this.

97
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:24,714
And here we have 
the situation with a lot

98
00:05:24,714 --> 00:05:27,024
of deoxygenated red blood cells.

99
00:05:27,024 --> 00:05:29,839
So we have a number of red blood cells 
here that are deoxygenated--

100
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:34,480
they're in blue; in red are 
the oxygenated red blood cells.

101
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:39,970
The paramagnetism, the effect,
the paramagnetic deoxy--

102
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:46,083
the susceptibility 
of deoxyhemoglobin is 1.6.

103
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,713
So now what happens is

104
00:05:47,713 --> 00:05:51,262
there is a distortion in magnetic field
that is generated.

105
00:05:52,912 --> 00:05:55,755
We do know that this actually happens
based on the orientation:

106
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:57,675
if you take an infinitely long cylinder--

107
00:05:57,675 --> 00:06:01,395
for those of you who are 
familiar with electromagnetics

108
00:06:01,395 --> 00:06:02,996
or remember the calculations--

109
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:06,356
if you put an infinitely long cylinder
in a magnetic field,

110
00:06:06,356 --> 00:06:08,047
parallel to the magnetic field,

111
00:06:08,047 --> 00:06:10,237
we would not see a distortion
of the magnetic field

112
00:06:10,237 --> 00:06:11,827
like this is seen here.

113
00:06:11,827 --> 00:06:13,977
This one here is our perpendicular,

114
00:06:13,977 --> 00:06:16,388
and here the effects
are quite substantial--

115
00:06:16,388 --> 00:06:19,843
there's a distortion around the vessel
of the magnetic field.

116
00:06:19,843 --> 00:06:23,380
If we take now an oxygenated vessel--

117
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,520
let's take an artery, 
here we have a vein--

118
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:29,680
we have much more
oxygenated red blood cells

119
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,322
and very few
deoxygenated red blood cells,

120
00:06:32,322 --> 00:06:36,882
so the average susceptibility
in the blood vessel is around -0.3.

121
00:06:36,882 --> 00:06:40,233
And here we have very little distortions
of the magnetic field

122
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,493
outside of the vessel.

123
00:06:44,393 --> 00:06:49,685
So, inside the vessel,
we have a big susceptibility effect--

124
00:06:49,685 --> 00:06:52,396
and here I'll take first
the deoxygenated capillary,

125
00:06:52,396 --> 00:06:55,606
the magnetic field is along <i>z</i>,
so it's to the right--

126
00:06:55,606 --> 00:06:59,847
and I'll plot here the susceptibility
as a function of position.

127
00:06:59,847 --> 00:07:04,709
It's a rough approximation; it's a sketch.

128
00:07:04,709 --> 00:07:08,949
We know that we have a deoxygenated
capillary, deoxygenated blood,

129
00:07:08,949 --> 00:07:12,940
so the susceptibility, 
the magnetic field, inside is higher.

130
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,506
We have the tissue,
which is essentially just water,

131
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:19,192
the susceptibility is lower.

132
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:24,732
So we have a difference of susceptibility
between inside the vessel and outside.

133
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:27,093
What this means in terms of magnetic field

134
00:07:27,093 --> 00:07:32,333
is that we have a different magnetic field
inside the vessel, and outside the vessel.

135
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:38,526
And somewhere there is a transition
between the two magnetic fields.

136
00:07:38,526 --> 00:07:40,256
The transition is not immediate--

137
00:07:40,256 --> 00:07:42,326
we don't have a discontinuous nature--

138
00:07:42,326 --> 00:07:47,258
so it falls off gradually
with an appreciable gradient.

139
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:50,988
So, what this means is that actually,
outside of the capillary,

140
00:07:50,988 --> 00:07:55,629
we have a change in magnetic field,
a change in <i>delta B-0</i>,

141
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:58,600
that's happening inside the tissue.

142
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,159
If we look at the oxygenated capillary,

143
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:03,070
I'll draw it in red here,

144
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:08,181
the difference in magnetic field,
the change that happens in the tissue,

145
00:08:08,181 --> 00:08:12,583
is much smaller because we have almost

146
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:15,823
a nearly perfect diamagnetic situation

147
00:08:15,823 --> 00:08:17,804
in the blood here.

148
00:08:17,804 --> 00:08:22,215
Now, the consequence, if we have
such a gradient of magnetic field

149
00:08:22,215 --> 00:08:24,285
surrounding the capillary,

150
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:25,955
the image voxel is much bigger,

151
00:08:25,955 --> 00:08:28,990
so this means that we are going 
to have a <i>delta B</i>

152
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:32,664
that is induced by physiology
and that is <i>non-zero</i>.

153
00:08:34,114 --> 00:08:38,428
So there is a consequence here
that the <i>T_2 star</i> increases

154
00:08:38,428 --> 00:08:43,809
with decreased deoxy-hemoglobin
concentration in the tissue.

155
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:45,229
So, that is in the blood,

156
00:08:45,229 --> 00:08:49,689
but that's the average
deoxy-hemoglobin concentration changes--

157
00:08:49,689 --> 00:08:53,953
if it decreases, then <i>T-2 star</i>
will increase

158
00:08:53,953 --> 00:08:57,146
because we are reducing
the <i>delt B_0</i> term here

159
00:08:57,146 --> 00:08:59,742
which we have seen previously

160
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:01,553
influences the <i>T_2 star</i>.

161
00:09:03,373 --> 00:09:06,102
Of course, a little caveat,
this depends on

162
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:08,764
the venous architecture in the voxel
depends on blood volume,

163
00:09:08,764 --> 00:09:11,394
it depends on the orientation
of the blood vessels,

164
00:09:11,394 --> 00:09:17,217
but we'll assume here for the rest
that this is fairly randomly ordered.

165
00:09:18,427 --> 00:09:21,807
So now, how do we
get from a change in <i>delta B_0</i>

166
00:09:21,807 --> 00:09:24,997
that's induced by 
susceptibility changes in the vessel,

167
00:09:24,997 --> 00:09:31,808
to a contrast that is dependent
on the blood oxygen level?

168
00:09:31,808 --> 00:09:33,618
We know from brain physiology--

169
00:09:33,618 --> 00:09:37,308
we discussed this
in the first part of this course--

170
00:09:37,308 --> 00:09:41,061
that the oxygen consumption increases
much less than blood flow

171
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:44,861
during a mental task.
The mental task can be finger tapping,

172
00:09:44,861 --> 00:09:47,821
it can be really a mental task,
it can be looking at an image,

173
00:09:47,821 --> 00:09:50,303
it can be listening to a sound, etc.

174
00:09:50,303 --> 00:09:52,922
So what is the consequence
if oxygen consumption

175
00:09:52,922 --> 00:09:57,750
increases less, or doesn't increase,
above blood flow increases?

176
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,679
And this is also something
that we've discussed in Course 7,

177
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:03,095
is from mass balance,
from fixed principle,

178
00:10:03,095 --> 00:10:07,731
the concentration of oxygen flowing in--
the arterial oxygen concentration--

179
00:10:07,731 --> 00:10:10,507
minus the venous oxygen concentration,

180
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:14,107
is equal to the rate 
of oxygen consumption divided by flow.

181
00:10:14,107 --> 00:10:18,678
So if we take the simplified assumption
that a situation--

182
00:10:18,678 --> 00:10:20,349
just for mentally thinking it--

183
00:10:20,349 --> 00:10:24,149
that the oxygen consumption 
does not change, but blood flow increases,

184
00:10:24,149 --> 00:10:26,899
then this difference has to decrease

185
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:31,532
and the only thing that we can change
is the oxygen consumption in the veins

186
00:10:31,532 --> 00:10:34,091
and this one will increase.

187
00:10:34,091 --> 00:10:36,052
The oxygen consumption in the veins

188
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,331
is linked to the partial pressure
of oxygen in the blood

189
00:10:39,331 --> 00:10:41,803
and this, in turn, is linked
to the percent saturation

190
00:10:41,803 --> 00:10:44,343
of the hemoglobin molecules.

191
00:10:44,343 --> 00:10:47,315
This is the saturation curve
of hemoglobin here--

192
00:10:47,315 --> 00:10:49,064
it's a monotonous curve--

193
00:10:49,064 --> 00:10:51,725
and so the oxygen concentration
in the blood

194
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:55,775
will change the saturation
of the deoxy-hemoglobin in the blood.

195
00:10:57,355 --> 00:11:00,275
Here we have typically around 90-95%--

196
00:11:00,275 --> 00:11:06,816
most of the hemoglobin is saturated
but this will change in the blood.

197
00:11:08,606 --> 00:11:10,939
We're now looking at
the hemodynamic response,

198
00:11:10,939 --> 00:11:14,309
what one sees in physiology is that
there's an increase in blood flow,

199
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:17,179
so there's a decrease
in deoxy-hemoglobin in the tissue,

200
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:18,810
there's an increase in BOLD.

201
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:20,940
There is, however,
a counteracting effect

202
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,311
that is also a typical
increase in blood volume.

203
00:11:23,311 --> 00:11:27,731
This increases the number
of red blood cells in the tissue,

204
00:11:27,731 --> 00:11:29,952
so the deoxy-hemoglobin increases

205
00:11:29,952 --> 00:11:32,632
and that decreases the BOLD effect.

206
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:35,694
And I won't go into much of the details--
it's not the purpose of the course

207
00:11:35,694 --> 00:11:37,363
to be a course on fMRI--

208
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:40,895
but in general, the BOLD response,
the BOLD signal,

209
00:11:40,895 --> 00:11:45,366
is positively correlated
with changes in blood flow,

210
00:11:45,366 --> 00:11:47,739
inversely correlated
with changes in blood volume

211
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:52,407
and inversely correlated
with changes in oxygen consumption rate.

212
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,277
This is the cerebral rate
of metabolic oxygen,

213
00:11:54,277 --> 00:11:57,308
cerebral blood volume,
and cerebral blood flow.

214
00:11:57,308 --> 00:12:00,059
So if we look at 
the vessel architecture of the brain--

215
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:01,890
this is what we see in an MRI--

216
00:12:01,890 --> 00:12:04,399
in red are the blood vessels typically.

217
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,761
And now, if we zoom in
to an imaging voxel--

218
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,621
that's our MRI voxel here--

219
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:13,721
then we see inside the voxel
the fine architecture.

220
00:12:13,721 --> 00:12:16,502
So we'll see here the arterial input,

221
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:20,713
and we see the venules
and the capillary bed.

222
00:12:20,713 --> 00:12:25,203
So this is essentially what contributes 
the changes in <i>delta B_0</i>,

223
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,004
we're looking at a voxel here,

224
00:12:27,004 --> 00:12:29,758
inside the voxel
we have this architecture.

225
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:33,875
And this changes now, depending
on oxygenation here, of this vessel--

226
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:38,816
this will change the gradient
in magnetic field surrounding the vessel.

227
00:12:38,816 --> 00:12:41,587
So if we look at
the situation now cartoon-wise,

228
00:12:41,587 --> 00:12:46,428
we have the artery supplying
oxygenated blood into the arterioles,

229
00:12:46,428 --> 00:12:48,868
then we come to the capillary bed,

230
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:52,709
and in the capillary bed
we have all our brain cells here--

231
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,560
we'll focus on the neurons--

232
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,190
then we have the venules,

233
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:59,420
and finally the vein--
that's the venous effluent.

234
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,110
The whole thing that I've drawn here

235
00:13:01,110 --> 00:13:06,952
corresponds to a length scale
of roughly 1-2cm.

236
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,482
So we have the feeding artery,
the draining vein,

237
00:13:09,482 --> 00:13:12,854
and in between, at some point,
we'll have the capillary bed.

238
00:13:12,854 --> 00:13:16,383
Now what happens
if we apply an external stimulus,

239
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:18,104
the neurons fire.

240
00:13:18,104 --> 00:13:20,794
As they fire, afterwards we get
the blood flow response,

241
00:13:20,794 --> 00:13:22,775
and the blood flow response

242
00:13:22,775 --> 00:13:24,655
is much stronger
than the oxygen consumption.

243
00:13:24,655 --> 00:13:29,886
That response results
in an increased blood flow in general.

244
00:13:29,886 --> 00:13:35,108
The increased blood flow
decreases the deoxy-hemoglobin content

245
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:37,978
and the venous blood becomes pink.

246
00:13:37,978 --> 00:13:39,559
You can actually verify that--

247
00:13:39,559 --> 00:13:42,150
if you cut yourself in the foot,
you're standing,

248
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,079
then the blood that comes out
is fairly dark.

249
00:13:45,079 --> 00:13:48,090
If you cut yourself in the foot,
and the foot is high up,

250
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:50,441
and you put some warm pads
around your leg,

251
00:13:50,441 --> 00:13:53,382
so you arterialize the blood flow--
you increase the blood flow--

252
00:13:53,382 --> 00:13:57,532
then the blood that comes out
of the wound is more pink.

253
00:13:57,532 --> 00:14:00,223
So what is this in time?

254
00:14:00,223 --> 00:14:02,413
So this sequence of events--

255
00:14:02,413 --> 00:14:05,424
we have neurons firing,
we have a change in blood flow,

256
00:14:05,424 --> 00:14:09,765
we have an increase
in oxy-hemoglobin in the veins,

257
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,725
a decrease in deoxy-hemoglobin--

258
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:14,005
how does this look over time?

259
00:14:14,005 --> 00:14:16,936
We're going to look here
at the fMRI signal--

260
00:14:16,936 --> 00:14:18,768
<i>T_2 star</i>-weighted signal--

261
00:14:18,768 --> 00:14:23,828
we have the stimulus,
which was applied here, in the green bar,

262
00:14:23,828 --> 00:14:28,608
and a few seconds later, we have a change
in the <i>T_2 star</i>-weighted signal.

263
00:14:28,608 --> 00:14:30,559
Notice here the scale:
it's percent change,

264
00:14:30,559 --> 00:14:33,754
so it's only in the order 
of a few percent, the signal change.

265
00:14:33,754 --> 00:14:36,890
It's a big enough change

266
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:39,452
to capture it with statistical means.

267
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:42,431
It's not a big enough change
to be able to look at an MRI

268
00:14:42,431 --> 00:14:44,521
and say what you're thinking.

269
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:48,873
So MRI as a lie detector, may work--
people are trying it--

270
00:14:48,873 --> 00:14:52,454
but in general you don't need to worry
if you go into an MRI,

271
00:14:52,454 --> 00:14:54,914
one does not need to worry,
if one goes into an MRI,

272
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:59,235
that one is able to read from the MRI
right away what you're thinking.

273
00:15:00,435 --> 00:15:04,716
Okay, so we have now the BOLD response,

274
00:15:04,716 --> 00:15:07,236
we see a signal
in <i>T_2 star</i>-weighted image,

275
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:12,366
and the question is now,
how is this used to image brain function?

276
00:15:12,366 --> 00:15:15,828
So here's a <i>T_2 star</i>-weighted image
of the human brain

277
00:15:15,828 --> 00:15:20,150
and if one now takes a task condition,
like looking at a light

278
00:15:20,150 --> 00:15:22,701
versus not looking at a light,

279
00:15:22,701 --> 00:15:24,591
takes the <i>T_2 star</i>-weighted images,

280
00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:27,430
and takes the difference
between these two time periods,

281
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,800
then one gets an image like this.

282
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:29,852
Fairly noisy--

283
00:15:29,852 --> 00:15:33,462
outside here is no noise
because it's been zeroed--

284
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:37,402
and here we see an area
that is fairly bright.

285
00:15:37,402 --> 00:15:40,773
This was in the early days how people
looked at brain activation,

286
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:44,544
to convince the critics that indeed
one could see brain activation,

287
00:15:44,544 --> 00:15:47,575
but this is no longer
the way this is being done.

288
00:15:47,575 --> 00:15:51,025
But I'm showing it here
for curiosity reasons.

289
00:15:51,025 --> 00:15:54,986
What is actually done nowadays
is that one collects an entire series,

290
00:15:54,986 --> 00:15:59,167
time series, of images over time,

291
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,738
over and over again,

292
00:16:00,738 --> 00:16:04,838
with special techniques that allow us
to acquire this much faster,

293
00:16:06,698 --> 00:16:09,469
and so this is a series
of <i>T_2 star</i>-weighted images;

294
00:16:09,469 --> 00:16:11,319
a time series.

295
00:16:11,319 --> 00:16:13,720
This is recorded-- 
here's, for example,

296
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:19,341
the time series of a single pixel
in a brain activation task--

297
00:16:19,341 --> 00:16:24,811
and you can see that the signal changes
relatively periodically.

298
00:16:24,811 --> 00:16:29,163
These activations are linked to the task--

299
00:16:29,163 --> 00:16:33,934
in this particular case,
there were 7 tasks, always the same task--

300
00:16:33,934 --> 00:16:39,725
and the change in <i>T_2 star</i>-weighted image
here, the BOLD change,

301
00:16:39,725 --> 00:16:42,675
corresponds to 
the application of this task,

302
00:16:42,675 --> 00:16:45,136
of the repetitive measure of this task.

303
00:16:45,136 --> 00:16:50,588
So now, since what we are looking for
is a change in pixel intensity,

304
00:16:50,588 --> 00:16:53,568
to say this is corresponding
to a change in <i>T_2 star</i>--

305
00:16:53,568 --> 00:16:56,299
in outlying
deoxy-hemoglobin changes--

306
00:16:56,299 --> 00:16:59,600
what one does is,
one takes this time series,

307
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,710
compares it to
the measured time series, the task,

308
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:06,200
and then does a statistical analysis.

309
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:08,801
So here, this means "on",
and this means "off"--

310
00:17:08,801 --> 00:17:12,162
actually, it's <i>state A</i> and <i>state B</i>
is the more correct term--

311
00:17:12,162 --> 00:17:16,792
so now comes the hard part
and that's a lot of statistical analysis.

312
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:19,173
We're not going to go into
the details here--

313
00:17:19,173 --> 00:17:22,502
one has to be very careful,
very stringent how it's being done--

314
00:17:22,502 --> 00:17:24,863
but what happens next.

315
00:17:24,863 --> 00:17:28,495
So what one gets then
is a statistical significance image.

316
00:17:28,495 --> 00:17:31,966
That basically just says, "I'm looking
at the statistical probability

317
00:17:31,966 --> 00:17:33,677
that a particular pixel here

318
00:17:33,677 --> 00:17:38,968
is indeed following 
the activation pattern given by the task."

319
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:43,247
And here we can see
a higher statistical significance.

320
00:17:43,247 --> 00:17:46,048
This actually is not looked at directly--

321
00:17:46,048 --> 00:17:49,349
what is looked at typically
is the thresholded statistical image--

322
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:53,820
so after a certain <i>z-score</i>,
statistical relevance score,

323
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,499
one decides,
yes, this pixel is indeed activated,

324
00:17:56,499 --> 00:17:59,331
it is responding to this particular task.

325
00:17:59,331 --> 00:18:01,512
And so one thresholds out

326
00:18:01,512 --> 00:18:06,592
the low statistical probability pixels

327
00:18:06,602 --> 00:18:12,574
and leaves only the high probability 
of statistical images.

328
00:18:12,574 --> 00:18:15,095
And of course, it's much more interesting

329
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:19,845
to overlay this on anatomical imaging,
too see exactly where the activation is,

330
00:18:19,845 --> 00:18:22,596
otherwise it appears just as a blob here--

331
00:18:22,596 --> 00:18:24,706
we won't exactly know where that is.

332
00:18:24,706 --> 00:18:29,077
So this is far more intuitive
to see where one exactly is.

333
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:32,290
So this is --

334
00:18:32,590 --> 00:18:36,430
in neuroscience, a very important 
imaging technique has become--

335
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,919
to study brain activation
in systems neuroscience.

336
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,030
It has, since the 90s,
essentially replaced

337
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:49,082
positron emission tomography
as a means to look at brain activation.

338
00:18:50,422 --> 00:18:52,632
Now we've talked about susceptibility:

339
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:55,983
the difference between
diamagnetic oxy-hemoglobin

340
00:18:55,983 --> 00:18:58,144
and paradiamagnetic deoxy-hemoglobin.

341
00:18:58,144 --> 00:19:01,355
But we have also other
susceptibility effects to contend with.

342
00:19:01,355 --> 00:19:04,926
And this is particularly
at the air-tissue interface,

343
00:19:04,926 --> 00:19:08,956
because tissue is diamagnetic,
just like oxy-hemoglobin,

344
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:11,507
and the air-- 
molecular oxygen is paramagnetic.

345
00:19:11,507 --> 00:19:13,147
We have seen this:

346
00:19:13,147 --> 00:19:19,188
20% oxygen in the air produces
sufficient paramagnetism in the air,

347
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:22,489
compared to our bodies
which are essentially water

348
00:19:22,489 --> 00:19:24,348
and therefore diamagnetic.

349
00:19:24,348 --> 00:19:26,460
So we'll have the same kind of transition

350
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:30,291
between the paramagnetic species,
which is the air around us,

351
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:33,381
and the diamagnetic surrounding--
well, that's our body--

352
00:19:33,381 --> 00:19:38,033
that creates changes in <i>B_0</i> at <i>delta B_0</i>.

353
00:19:38,033 --> 00:19:41,807
And so here is a gradient echo image
taken from the brain

354
00:19:41,807 --> 00:19:44,488
at a <i>TE</i> that's roughly <i>T_2 star</i>.

355
00:19:44,488 --> 00:19:46,694
And now we can see here

356
00:19:46,694 --> 00:19:51,505
different black areas.

357
00:19:51,505 --> 00:19:53,845
This is an image of the brain--

358
00:19:53,845 --> 00:19:56,467
it's a cut like this, about here--

359
00:19:56,467 --> 00:20:01,037
and can you guess 
what these black areas correspond to?

360
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:04,978
Well, this area up here is the sinus--

361
00:20:04,978 --> 00:20:07,858
we have here, behind the nose,

362
00:20:07,858 --> 00:20:10,628
we have the sinuses air-filled cavity,

363
00:20:10,628 --> 00:20:14,119
so it's filled with
paramagnetic molecular oxygen.

364
00:20:14,119 --> 00:20:17,301
And here we have the ear canal

365
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,811
that is also filled with
paramagnetic oxygen.

366
00:20:19,811 --> 00:20:22,071
And this creates, on this type of image,

367
00:20:22,071 --> 00:20:27,842
it creates a fallout of the signal because
there's dephasing of the magnetization

368
00:20:27,842 --> 00:20:29,962
due to the <i>delta B_0</i>.

369
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,203
Here's another example of an implant.

370
00:20:32,203 --> 00:20:36,014
Implants, if their susceptibility
doesn't match that of the tissue,

371
00:20:36,014 --> 00:20:38,525
they can produce the same effect.

372
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:42,874
One example is, for example, the TWOS.

373
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:45,894
So, how can we minimize these effects?

374
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:50,456
Here we notice that the signal
of the gradient echo

375
00:20:50,456 --> 00:20:54,006
is proportional to <i>e</i> to the minus <i>TE</i>
over <i>T_2 star</i>.

376
00:20:54,006 --> 00:20:59,859
So we can minimize these effects
by minimizing <i>TE</i>.

377
00:20:59,859 --> 00:21:02,019
And if we do this,

378
00:21:02,019 --> 00:21:05,579
then such a <i>T_2 star</i>-weighted image
will look like this--

379
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:08,080
this is a gradient echo with a short <i>TE</i>.

380
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:14,381
However, we actually want to have 
<i>T_2</i> weighting to obtain contrast--

381
00:21:14,381 --> 00:21:19,943
one still wants to be able 
to see tissue contrast.

382
00:21:19,943 --> 00:21:22,503
So this solution is not applicable.

383
00:21:22,503 --> 00:21:24,324
And here comes the second solution

384
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:28,784
that we will discuss now,
and that is to use SPIN ECHO,

385
00:21:28,784 --> 00:21:33,096
which eliminates the effects
of static field homogeneity.

386
00:21:33,096 --> 00:21:35,206
This is now coming up.
