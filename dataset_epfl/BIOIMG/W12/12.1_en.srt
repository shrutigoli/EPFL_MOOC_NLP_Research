1
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:09,993
This week's lectures are dealing
with the basic contrast mechanisms of MRI

2
00:00:10,653 --> 00:00:15,506
and so I want to first, however, start out
with a very important message

3
00:00:15,506 --> 00:00:17,760
that is dear to me and this is:

4
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:21,702
we are dealing here 
with one physical phenomenon

5
00:00:22,026 --> 00:00:23,755
and that is magnetic resonance.

6
00:00:24,263 --> 00:00:27,108
We're dealing with one instrument
that is one magnet

7
00:00:27,676 --> 00:00:32,648
but what we are getting 
out of this modality,

8
00:00:32,648 --> 00:00:37,657
out of this biophysical mechanism
is many different contrasts.

9
00:00:37,657 --> 00:00:40,217
So we have many different 
contrast mechanisms.

10
00:00:40,855 --> 00:00:43,801
So I want to first start out
with some examples.

11
00:00:44,431 --> 00:00:47,659
This is a so called proton density
weighted image.

12
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:50,460
So we have a cut through the head here.

13
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:51,650
This is from the brain

14
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:55,138
and if it's proton density 
then essentially what has been imaged here

15
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:57,349
is the equilibrium magnetizations,

16
00:00:57,349 --> 00:01:01,222
so that reflects the density
of the protons in the MRI.

17
00:01:02,054 --> 00:01:05,333
Then here's an example
of a <i>T1</i> weighted image.

18
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:10,958
Again a similar cut from the subject.

19
00:01:11,136 --> 00:01:13,652
It's a transversal cut, <i>T1</i> weighted,

20
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:17,237
so, and here is a <i>T2</i> weighted image.

21
00:01:17,944 --> 00:01:21,263
So these are some 
very basic contrasts,

22
00:01:21,713 --> 00:01:25,345
proton density 
<i>T1</i> weighted and <i>T2</i> weighted

23
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:29,981
and you can see that just by changing
some experimental parameters,

24
00:01:29,981 --> 00:01:34,595
one can substantially change
the appearance of the image.

25
00:01:35,398 --> 00:01:40,398
So here, what is interesting to note here
is the cerebrospinal fluid,

26
00:01:40,398 --> 00:01:43,132
the ventricles, they are filled with
cerebrospinal fluid.

27
00:01:44,313 --> 00:01:46,967
Here they are more intense
than the others

28
00:01:46,967 --> 00:01:48,784
because they have a bit more water

29
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:53,005
In the <i>T1</i> weighted image they're dark
because they have a long <i>T1</i>

30
00:01:53,121 --> 00:01:57,477
and in <i>T2</i> weighted image they are bright
because they have a long <i>T2.</i>

31
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:01,562
Here's an example which
is more pathological

32
00:02:01,562 --> 00:02:04,505
so this is clearly not
a normal part of the brain.

33
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,933
This is <i>T1</i> weighted
and here it's <i>T2</i> weighted.

34
00:02:08,301 --> 00:02:09,903
Now what is this space here?

35
00:02:10,158 --> 00:02:13,666
It's dark on <i>T1</i> weighted
like the cerebrospinal fluid.

36
00:02:13,868 --> 00:02:16,072
It's bright on a <i>T2</i> weighted
like cerebrospinal fluid.

37
00:02:16,072 --> 00:02:19,846
So this is a cavity where 
tissue has been eliminated.

38
00:02:20,055 --> 00:02:21,733
in fact it is a large cyst.

39
00:02:21,855 --> 00:02:23,583
It's just cerebrospinal fluid.

40
00:02:24,056 --> 00:02:30,879
Probably a resected tumor
or some complication early in life.

41
00:02:31,804 --> 00:02:34,327
Now here's another example,
it's a bit more elaborate

42
00:02:34,327 --> 00:02:40,194
that I want to illustrate here
and this is imaging multiple sclerosis,

43
00:02:40,194 --> 00:02:41,774
so we're looking at the plaques.

44
00:02:42,242 --> 00:02:46,336
So we're looking here
at the <i>T2</i> weighted image on the left

45
00:02:46,908 --> 00:02:52,750
and we see that cerebrospinal fluid
is bright, it's here in the ventricles,

46
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:54,361
and it's also in the cell site.

47
00:02:54,658 --> 00:02:57,389
And if one looks very carefully among
all these bright signals,

48
00:02:57,389 --> 00:02:59,792
one sees some signals here
that are somewhere

49
00:02:59,792 --> 00:03:01,684
where they shouldn't be.

50
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:05,053
But this is, with this--

51
00:03:05,053 --> 00:03:07,312
all this bright signal
is difficult to detect.

52
00:03:08,133 --> 00:03:12,014
So then the approach that is often
used in multiple sclerosis

53
00:03:12,014 --> 00:03:13,601
is to use the so-called

54
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:17,639
fluid attenuated 
inversion recovery approach.

55
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,750
So or FLAIR.

56
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:20,157
That's the acronym for that

57
00:03:20,537 --> 00:03:24,422
and this is a combination
of <i>T1</i> and <i>T2</i> weighted.

58
00:03:24,554 --> 00:03:29,780
First what is done with an inversion pulse
and an inversion time <i>TI</i>

59
00:03:30,052 --> 00:03:33,416
that is such that the signal from the CSF,
the magnetization,

60
00:03:33,736 --> 00:03:36,518
the longitudinal magnetization
from the CSF is zero.

61
00:03:36,746 --> 00:03:39,373
At that point when the
longitudinal magnetization

62
00:03:39,373 --> 00:03:42,476
in the cerebrospinal fluid is zero,
the signal is read out

63
00:03:43,117 --> 00:03:49,727
and then detected with a long echo time
so it is <i>T2</i> weighted.

64
00:03:50,391 --> 00:03:53,418
What then happens is 
that these lesions here

65
00:03:55,231 --> 00:03:58,975
in the brain tissue 
the signal changes appreciably

66
00:03:59,662 --> 00:04:01,227
compared to the brain tissue

67
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:04,500
and there's substantially
more contrast to noise ratio.

68
00:04:04,774 --> 00:04:07,595
Here the signal to noise ratio
is substantially better

69
00:04:07,595 --> 00:04:10,373
but here the contrast ratio
that's distinguishes

70
00:04:10,373 --> 00:04:14,809
these demyelinating legions
from the normal appearing tissues

71
00:04:15,286 --> 00:04:18,742
around them is much easier detectable.

72
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:21,280
And finally, we have the <i>T1</i> weighted image.

73
00:04:21,474 --> 00:04:25,051
On the T1 weighted image
because demyelinating legions

74
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:28,213
are destruction of tissue,
so there's less tissue, less membranes,

75
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:31,320
less proteins around, <i>T1</i> and <i>T2</i>
are getting longer,

76
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:36,352
<i>T1</i> is longer, they appear as dark
and then again not as visible

77
00:04:36,352 --> 00:04:38,562
as they are here on the middle image.

78
00:04:38,734 --> 00:04:42,972
So we have here just the examples
<i>T1, T2,</i> and proton density

79
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:48,754
that give us already 
three basic contrasts in MRI.

80
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:53,251
Another contrast I want to discuss
this week is <i>T2</i>* weighted.

81
00:04:53,251 --> 00:04:55,854
We're actually going to discuss
this contrast first.

82
00:04:56,199 --> 00:05:01,703
With <i>T2</i>* weighting,
what is often done is venography.

83
00:05:01,703 --> 00:05:06,789
And the goal here is to use
experimental conditions

84
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,845
that at which point the magnetization

85
00:05:10,845 --> 00:05:14,845
that's in the venous blood has decayed

86
00:05:14,845 --> 00:05:17,941
so venous blood, the signal 
from venous blood is darker

87
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:19,349
than normal tissue.

88
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:21,944
So it's a reduction in magnetization
in blood.

89
00:05:22,547 --> 00:05:25,299
What is a venogram?
What does it look like?

90
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:26,584
Here is from the brain.

91
00:05:26,687 --> 00:05:30,721
So this is a <i>T2</i>* weighted image
and all these black stripes here,

92
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:32,445
that are in here,

93
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:39,515
they're in fact normal manifestation
of venous blood that has a short <i>T2</i>*.

94
00:05:39,788 --> 00:05:42,594
That is deoxygenated 
and we'll see shortly.

95
00:05:43,255 --> 00:05:45,014
We'll discuss this shortly.

96
00:05:46,922 --> 00:05:53,209
In research there has been functional MRI
has been coming along.

97
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:58,671
It's based on blood oxygen level
dependent functional MRI

98
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:01,545
or BOLD fMRI 
and what I want to highlight here

99
00:06:01,545 --> 00:06:07,412
is an example of the very first images,
or some of the very first images

100
00:06:08,353 --> 00:06:12,147
that Seiji Ogawa at Bell Labs
obtained at the time

101
00:06:12,147 --> 00:06:15,180
in the late 1980's from the rat's brain.

102
00:06:15,218 --> 00:06:18,937
So this is a rat brain
under normal conditions.

103
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:24,314
This is what such a <i>T2</i>* 
weighted image looks like.

104
00:06:24,656 --> 00:06:27,372
And one day he noticed
that in one of the animals

105
00:06:27,884 --> 00:06:29,942
which was having trouble breathing,

106
00:06:29,942 --> 00:06:32,443
he obtained an image 
that looked like this.

107
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:35,649
There were the venous structures
that were dark appearing

108
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:42,106
and general the sensitivity of the signal
had decreased.

109
00:06:43,632 --> 00:06:50,074
And he had the enormous insight
to realize that from neuroscience

110
00:06:50,414 --> 00:06:53,433
we knew that there is an increase
in cerebral blood flow

111
00:06:53,682 --> 00:06:55,924
much more than oxygen extraction.

112
00:06:55,924 --> 00:06:59,613
So this would lead to a change
in deoxygenation in the blood vessels

113
00:06:59,817 --> 00:07:05,011
and he proposed at the time
that this is possible to exploit

114
00:07:05,215 --> 00:07:10,003
in normal brain activation studies
to see the activity of the brain

115
00:07:10,162 --> 00:07:14,412
and hence in the early 90's
the functional MRI was born.

116
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:20,474
Nowadays the datasets used for fMRI
for brain activation studies

117
00:07:21,195 --> 00:07:25,121
depict datasets like this,
so we have the anatomical image.

118
00:07:25,254 --> 00:07:29,740
Here are the eyeballs, retrobulbar fat.
this is axial cut, this is a coronal cut,

119
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,532
these are sagittal cuts and overlaid
on the anatomical images

120
00:07:33,648 --> 00:07:38,949
are the area of the brain
that have been activated

121
00:07:39,066 --> 00:07:41,519
in response to an external stimulus.

122
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:44,862
That stimulus can be finger tapping,
it can be looking at an image,

123
00:07:44,862 --> 00:07:48,253
it can be listening to a sound,
it can be a mental task, and so forth.

124
00:07:49,964 --> 00:07:54,292
Now I want to give here another view
on spatial coding with MRI.

125
00:07:54,483 --> 00:07:55,973
Last week we have introduced

126
00:07:55,973 --> 00:07:58,483
a two dimensional
spatial encoding with MRI

127
00:07:58,813 --> 00:08:03,131
and I'm sure you have found it
not the easiest topic to understand.

128
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:06,705
So I want to give it here another try
and give you another argument

129
00:08:06,855 --> 00:08:10,608
to rationalize how we reconstruct 
images with MRI.

130
00:08:11,854 --> 00:08:15,150
So let's start with the basic experiment.

131
00:08:15,184 --> 00:08:18,660
We need to have an <i>RF pulse</i> to flip
the magnetization into transfer plane

132
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,319
so we have something that precesses
that we can detect.

133
00:08:22,121 --> 00:08:24,484
This is done typically 
with a slice select gradient

134
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:27,507
so we're selecting a slice
like this in the brain

135
00:08:27,688 --> 00:08:31,642
and then we have the frequency
and encode gradient that is switched.

136
00:08:32,199 --> 00:08:34,466
The first part 
of the experiment is excitation

137
00:08:36,607 --> 00:08:40,669
and then we have frequency and coding,
so two phases of the experiment.

138
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:46,636
We observe here the echo time
at this time point.

139
00:08:46,636 --> 00:08:49,279
The echo, we observe the echo
at this time point

140
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,404
and this is defined by the echo time.

141
00:08:51,728 --> 00:08:57,579
We have seen that we need
this negative gradient refocusing gradient

142
00:08:57,579 --> 00:09:01,746
to have maximal sensitivity 
to minimize the effects of dephasing

143
00:09:01,746 --> 00:09:03,250
under slice select gradient.

144
00:09:03,411 --> 00:09:06,613
Here is the frequency encoding 
dephase and rephase

145
00:09:06,613 --> 00:09:09,463
and when these two areas
are the same we have echo.

146
00:09:10,892 --> 00:09:14,218
So now I'll introduce a time
and I'll call it <i>T2.</i>

147
00:09:14,218 --> 00:09:17,698
You'll see shortly why I call it <i>T2</i>
and not just simply, <i>T2.</i>

148
00:09:17,756 --> 00:09:22,103
So as we record the signal
with this scanner,

149
00:09:22,363 --> 00:09:25,337
we'll call the time
during which this happens, <i>T2.</i>

150
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:30,634
And now we're going to look at the signal
as a function of <i>T2</i>

151
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:32,127
starting at this time point.

152
00:09:32,222 --> 00:09:34,402
So this is time zero here.

153
00:09:34,954 --> 00:09:37,152
This is equal to
the transverse magnetization

154
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,429
as a function of position <i>x</i>.

155
00:09:39,429 --> 00:09:41,885
We have the gradient here,
we'll assume along <i>x.</i>

156
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:45,041
So gradient will assume 
the frequency codes along <i>x.</i>

157
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,112
So magnetization starting here,
they're all aligned, they're collinear.

158
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:52,578
And then we have the different
precessional frequency

159
00:09:52,578 --> 00:09:55,337
based on the deposition along <i>x.</i>

160
00:09:55,477 --> 00:10:00,584
So it's gamma <i>G x</i> times x times <i>T2</i>
is the face as it evolves.

161
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:03,418
And of course the entire [scene] 
we see is the summation

162
00:10:03,418 --> 00:10:05,313
of all the signals along <i>x.</i>

163
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:09,438
So now the link between the signal
as a function of <i>T2</i>

164
00:10:09,438 --> 00:10:12,418
the time domain signal
and the magnetization

165
00:10:12,418 --> 00:10:13,916
as a function of position,

166
00:10:13,916 --> 00:10:18,290
the link between the two is given
by the Fourier transformation.

167
00:10:18,862 --> 00:10:22,125
And we take a standard Fourier pair,
time and frequency.

168
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:24,678
So the Fourier transform
of a signal and time

169
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:29,484
gives you a function as a function
of frequency.

170
00:10:29,484 --> 00:10:31,783
That's a standard Fourier pair,
time frequency.

171
00:10:31,896 --> 00:10:34,050
So if we have <i>T2</i> as our time variable,

172
00:10:34,311 --> 00:10:36,081
then <i>omega 2</i> is our --

173
00:10:36,109 --> 00:10:39,434
we'll call <i>omega 2</i>
the corresponding Fourier pair variable.

174
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:43,976
Now <i>omega 2</i> is the
<i>gamma Gx</i> times <i>x</i>,

175
00:10:44,117 --> 00:10:49,867
that is linked to the position
because the gradient is fixed.

176
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:54,218
The <i>gamma</i> is fixed so this is
<i>omega 2</i> is linearly related

177
00:10:54,357 --> 00:10:55,892
to the position.

178
00:10:55,974 --> 00:10:58,944
So the magnetization is a function
of this frequency

179
00:10:58,944 --> 00:11:01,848
is equal to the magnetization
as a function of position.

180
00:11:03,192 --> 00:11:07,393
Okay so actually if we look
at a two-dimensional object

181
00:11:07,545 --> 00:11:09,201
at a given position in <i>x</i>,

182
00:11:09,329 --> 00:11:13,105
all the magnetizations that have
the same coordinate along <i>x</i>,

183
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:17,361
for this gradient along <i>y</i>,

184
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:19,216
they'll have the same 
precessional frequency

185
00:11:19,216 --> 00:11:20,716
so we cannot distinguish them.

186
00:11:20,716 --> 00:11:22,847
They'll just appear as a stronger signal

187
00:11:22,847 --> 00:11:26,177
and this is reflected that 
we have to sum along <i>y</i>,

188
00:11:26,177 --> 00:11:29,448
all the magnetizations along <i>y,</i>
for a given position <i>x.</i>

189
00:11:29,448 --> 00:11:31,482
That's our magnetization along <i>x</i>.

190
00:11:31,911 --> 00:11:35,345
And so it turns out that 
after Fourier transform

191
00:11:35,345 --> 00:11:37,986
of our echo here of this signal

192
00:11:38,756 --> 00:11:43,086
we're getting <i>M</i> of <i>x</i>
and <i>M</i> of <i>x</i> is the Radon transform

193
00:11:43,086 --> 00:11:49,401
of the magnetization along

194
00:11:50,031 --> 00:11:51,297
the direction <i>x.</i>

195
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:55,148
Now what we can do is here,
this is for a particular direction <i>x</i>

196
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:56,984
but I have not defined what <i>x</i> is

197
00:11:56,984 --> 00:11:59,747
so I can choose any coordinate system
and have <i>x</i> different.

198
00:11:59,963 --> 00:12:04,180
And so we can actually change
the orientation of this projection,

199
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:06,271
the magnetization of <i>x,</i>

200
00:12:06,271 --> 00:12:09,553
by now changing the orientation
of the gradient,

201
00:12:09,553 --> 00:12:12,402
because the direction 
of this Radon transform

202
00:12:12,402 --> 00:12:15,503
is entirely defined 
by the gradient orientation.

203
00:12:16,021 --> 00:12:17,496
So if I now choose a gradient,

204
00:12:17,496 --> 00:12:20,072
and remember we have introduced
gradient as vector

205
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:22,846
as a linear combination of--

206
00:12:26,175 --> 00:12:29,119
as with two components
basically with a constant amplitude

207
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:31,859
but I will rotate it by an angle <i>phi</i>.

208
00:12:31,859 --> 00:12:34,773
What this amounts to is,
that we are recording the projection,

209
00:12:34,782 --> 00:12:38,966
the echo, along an orientation
that is rotated with respect to <i>x</i>

210
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,179
by the angle <i>phi.</i>

211
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:41,716
You can verify that,

212
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:44,303
if <i>phi</i> is zero,
then we have a gradient along <i>x.</i>

213
00:12:44,338 --> 00:12:47,605
If <i>phi</i> is 90 degrees,
then we have a gradient along <i>y.</i>

214
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,060
And of course we can be changed
between the two gradually

215
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,492
by changing <i>phi</i> gradually.

216
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:58,478
And so this we can repeat,
we can repeat different projections.

217
00:12:58,478 --> 00:13:00,737
We'll collect 
after Fourier transformation

218
00:13:00,737 --> 00:13:03,627
the Radon transforms
of our magnetization.

219
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:07,901
We'll do this in many steps
just like with CT.

220
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:11,793
We'll have to take into account
that we have to every time

221
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:13,382
to measure new Radon transform.

222
00:13:13,382 --> 00:13:15,741
We'll have to do a new excitation.

223
00:13:15,881 --> 00:13:21,498
So this will be done every <i>TR</i> seconds
based on the repetition time.

224
00:13:22,361 --> 00:13:24,280
This leads to a sinogram.

225
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:29,031
In principle we can reconstruct any image
with projection reconstruction

226
00:13:29,031 --> 00:13:31,846
or we can make a link to
Fourier transformation

227
00:13:31,846 --> 00:13:33,878
with a central slice theorem.

228
00:13:34,041 --> 00:13:39,128
So if this helps you to understand
why MRI scans take some time

229
00:13:39,128 --> 00:13:41,885
we are going to have to collect
the different projections,

230
00:13:41,934 --> 00:13:44,978
the different angles,
we can do that just as well.

231
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,026
It has been done in the X-ray techniques
and then reconstruct the image

232
00:13:51,026 --> 00:13:54,931
using those techniques is definitely
a possibility.

233
00:13:54,957 --> 00:13:57,994
So this could convince you
that it indeed,

234
00:13:58,474 --> 00:14:01,170
A, it is possible to reconstruct
an image,

235
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:08,029
and B, why collecting the data of an image
does take considerable time

236
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:11,599
because if we want to have
a 256 by 256 matrix

237
00:14:11,736 --> 00:14:14,954
that means we have to collect
256 angles <i>phi</i>

238
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:19,207
and for this we have to wait
256 <i>TR</i> periods.

239
00:14:19,207 --> 00:14:25,424
<i>TR</i> is linked to <i>T1</i> so it is typically
on the order of the <i>T1</i> relaxation time

240
00:14:25,424 --> 00:14:29,910
and therefore that explains
why it takes typically a couple of minutes

241
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:32,362
to obtain an MRI image.

242
00:14:33,734 --> 00:14:36,013
Okay so if this helps you,

243
00:14:36,013 --> 00:14:40,164
but now I'm going to try to look
at the phase encode gradient

244
00:14:40,196 --> 00:14:47,451
because the MRI reconstruction
and data requisition is rarely done

245
00:14:47,808 --> 00:14:50,460
using the Radon transform approach.

246
00:14:50,629 --> 00:14:54,384
There are some applications
but they are the vast majority.

247
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:58,086
The major application, the major way
of obtaining the image is done

248
00:14:58,086 --> 00:15:02,387
by two-dimensional encoding
using the phase encode gradient.

249
00:15:02,814 --> 00:15:06,337
Now what I want to make here the argument
is phase encoding is essentially

250
00:15:06,337 --> 00:15:09,701
just frequency encoding
in a second time dimension.

251
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,852
So we'll just put in here
a phase encode gradient.

252
00:15:12,852 --> 00:15:14,798
We're looking here at this time period.

253
00:15:15,478 --> 00:15:18,120
It's the third-dimension
and now we'll look at here

254
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:21,326
at the <i>y</i> gradient we've had last week

255
00:15:21,326 --> 00:15:24,684
we have talked about phase encode gradient
having a certain amplitude,

256
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,062
and a certain duration <i>tau.</i>

257
00:15:27,626 --> 00:15:32,541
And if we have now an <i>Nth</i> step
then the amplitude of the gradient

258
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,609
is <i>N</i> times <i>delta gamma y,</i>

259
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:39,136
that's the gradient strength
times <i>y</i> times <i>gamma</i> times the duration

260
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:42,120
that gives us the phase twist induced
by this gradient.

261
00:15:42,196 --> 00:15:46,486
So for the <i>Nth</i> phase encode state
the transverse magnetization

262
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,884
after this phase encode gradient

263
00:15:48,884 --> 00:15:51,818
so right here is given by the
magnetization before

264
00:15:52,158 --> 00:15:56,383
so that's the transverse magnetization here
times this phase term here.

265
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:03,155
And what we have done is we've argued
that if we now step through

266
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:08,448
these amplitudes with a decrement
or an increment of <i>delta Gy,</i>

267
00:16:08,469 --> 00:16:10,746
we do this several times.

268
00:16:11,197 --> 00:16:16,695
That this essentially allows us
to encode the second spatial dimension.

269
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:21,212
The argument there was that I made
it was graphical to say,

270
00:16:21,212 --> 00:16:23,812
well in the end the computer
cannot distinguish whether

271
00:16:23,812 --> 00:16:26,960
we have collected 
one-dimension immediately

272
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,714
and the other one step by step
or if we do it in reverse

273
00:16:29,714 --> 00:16:32,300
and therefore these two things 
are equivalent.

274
00:16:32,844 --> 00:16:36,362
Now what I want to argue here is
that we can actually look--

275
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,026
if you look here at the gradient times
time term,

276
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:41,014
the <i>n delta Gy tau,</i>

277
00:16:41,293 --> 00:16:43,591
I can rewrite this and I'll say,

278
00:16:43,591 --> 00:16:46,152
well <i>n</i> times <i>delta Gy tau,</i>

279
00:16:47,838 --> 00:16:53,208
I'll express this as a constant gradient
times <i>n</i> times <i>delta tau.</i>

280
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:59,752
So now I have a constant gradient
along <i>y</i> and I have this term <i>n delta tau.</i>

281
00:16:59,752 --> 00:17:00,687
What does this mean?

282
00:17:00,687 --> 00:17:02,142
So for the <i>Nth</i> gradient step

283
00:17:02,142 --> 00:17:04,235
we'll start out with
the first gradient step

284
00:17:04,302 --> 00:17:08,787
we'll have an amplitude,
<i>Gy</i>, this is the gradient along <i>y,</i>

285
00:17:08,787 --> 00:17:10,749
and we'll have a duration of <i>delta tau.</i>

286
00:17:11,402 --> 00:17:15,343
If we do now the second step,
then we have a duration of two <i>delta tau,</i>

287
00:17:15,361 --> 00:17:20,075
and three <i>delta tau,</i>
four <i>delta tau,</i> and so on.

288
00:17:20,567 --> 00:17:22,408
Five <i>delta tau</i> here.

289
00:17:22,408 --> 00:17:24,493
So it's up to <i>n delta tau.</i>

290
00:17:24,745 --> 00:17:29,949
And now we'll rewrite the magnetization
the effect of this gradient again,

291
00:17:29,949 --> 00:17:32,630
gradient times time
gives you the phase effect.

292
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:39,422
So gradient times time <i>n delta tau</i>
times <i>y</i> times <i>gamma</i> is the phase term.

293
00:17:39,596 --> 00:17:43,124
We're just using this identity here
so we're getting the magnetization now

294
00:17:43,292 --> 00:17:47,529
expressed in this form, the evolution
of magnetization on to the gradient.

295
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:53,791
And now I can say well <i>n delta tau</i>
that's just nothing but a time dimension

296
00:17:54,648 --> 00:17:58,880
which I call <i>T1</i> that has been
discretely sampled at intervals <i>delta tau.</i>

297
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,269
So in the end effect
what we are now getting

298
00:18:01,269 --> 00:18:04,056
is a signal that depends
on two time dimensions.

299
00:18:04,056 --> 00:18:06,013
<i>T2</i> is the time as we recorded,

300
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,384
<i>T1</i> has been defined as the time
step by step

301
00:18:09,384 --> 00:18:13,519
as we increase the gradient duration
for this example

302
00:18:13,519 --> 00:18:15,489
but we have seen 
that this is equivalent

303
00:18:15,489 --> 00:18:18,762
to increasing the gradient amplitude
step by step.

304
00:18:19,441 --> 00:18:23,322
So if we consider the signal
is now a two dimensional time signal,

305
00:18:23,322 --> 00:18:25,765
there are of course not
two dimensional times as such

306
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:28,423
but it's a second virtual
time dimension,

307
00:18:28,697 --> 00:18:32,224
we can do the frequency,
the Fourier transformation,

308
00:18:32,224 --> 00:18:35,327
two dimensional Fourier transformation,
we got two time variables,

309
00:18:35,327 --> 00:18:38,431
and this gives us a--
from the signal of <i>T1</i> and <i>T2,</i>

310
00:18:38,431 --> 00:18:42,042
gives us a magnetization as a function
of <i>omega 1</i> and <i>omega 2,</i>

311
00:18:42,042 --> 00:18:44,933
and therefore a magnetization

312
00:18:44,933 --> 00:18:50,568
as a function of <i>y</i> and <i>x,</i>

313
00:18:50,848 --> 00:18:54,519
because <i>omega 1</i> is linked
to the position in <i>y</i> here

314
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:59,500
and <i>omega 2</i> is linked
to the position in <i>x</i> that's here.

315
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:05,085
So we have a two dimensional time signal
we can view it as that way,

316
00:19:05,085 --> 00:19:08,039
it's not standard way done in the MRI
but if it helps you

317
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:09,660
this is another way to look at it.

318
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,198
Two dimensional Fourier transform
gives us two frequencies.

319
00:19:12,198 --> 00:19:15,259
A two dimensional object
and these frequencies through

320
00:19:15,259 --> 00:19:19,760
the Larmor equation are linked
to position with the gradient condition.

321
00:19:21,985 --> 00:19:28,171
Okay so much to rehash
the spatial encoding with MRI,

322
00:19:28,171 --> 00:19:35,538
the phase encoding and I hope this helps
you with this relatively difficult topic

323
00:19:35,538 --> 00:19:38,855
and understanding
how we generate 2D images.

324
00:19:40,408 --> 00:19:44,106
Okay so last week we introduced
a gradient echo sequence,

325
00:19:44,106 --> 00:19:47,914
this is the basic experiment
with which one generates images.

326
00:19:47,951 --> 00:19:51,346
We've introduced how
the spatial information is encoded.

327
00:19:51,489 --> 00:19:53,743
So now the question that
I want to go after is:

328
00:19:53,743 --> 00:19:56,560
What is the contrast
in gradient echo imaging?

329
00:19:56,788 --> 00:20:00,610
And here we will introduce
<i>T2</i>* weighting.

330
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:05,000
So we have the <i>RF pulse</i>
which is at an <i>alpha</i> degree.

331
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,641
We need this pulse to generate
transverse magnetization.

332
00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:10,032
It is done with slice selection.

333
00:20:10,032 --> 00:20:11,790
So we're selecting a slice here

334
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:16,209
and the areas of these two gradients
are equal but opposite.

335
00:20:16,209 --> 00:20:19,210
This is refocusing
so we have maximum signal.

336
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:25,066
Then we have the frequency encode gradient
with dephasing and rephasing.

337
00:20:25,269 --> 00:20:29,341
And this area here then defines
the rephasing.

338
00:20:29,341 --> 00:20:32,195
And we have the phase encode gradient.

339
00:20:32,446 --> 00:20:35,831
This gives us the signal that is
ultimately recorded.

340
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:38,098
We'll set this time here to zero

341
00:20:38,098 --> 00:20:42,037
and here the time is defined
by the frequency encode gradient.

342
00:20:42,037 --> 00:20:44,034
This is the echo time <i>TE.</i>

343
00:20:44,287 --> 00:20:47,818
So this is our basic imaging sequence,

344
00:20:47,818 --> 00:20:52,161
this is repeated <i>n</i> times
to generate the image.

345
00:20:52,175 --> 00:20:58,124
Now what we want to look at is
one effect that produces <i>T2</i>* weighting

346
00:20:58,275 --> 00:21:03,909
and that is to look at the effect
of static field imperfection,

347
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,669
which we haven't dealt with yet.

348
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:08,349
So far I have introduced you
to the relaxation times

349
00:21:08,976 --> 00:21:11,901
and so far we have dealt with the <i>B0,</i>

350
00:21:12,044 --> 00:21:15,004
aside from the gradient
that we introduce in the scanner,

351
00:21:15,127 --> 00:21:18,624
the <i>B0</i> is perfectly homogeneous
in space

352
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,227
and this is unfortunately not true.

353
00:21:22,018 --> 00:21:26,274
In very general terms we can write this
static magnetic field to be

354
00:21:26,814 --> 00:21:29,682
around which the magnetization precesses
has to be zero.

355
00:21:30,299 --> 00:21:31,543
We have the gradient term,

356
00:21:31,543 --> 00:21:33,910
now this can be time variant
as we can see here,

357
00:21:34,514 --> 00:21:38,155
times the position plus a term
<i>delta B of r.</i>

358
00:21:38,716 --> 00:21:44,267
This <i>delta B of r</i> is nothing 
but the first order approximation

359
00:21:44,267 --> 00:21:47,518
of the Taylor series expansion
of the magnetic field, if you will.

360
00:21:47,644 --> 00:21:50,940
So it is the derivative of the <i>z</i> component
of the magnetic field,

361
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:55,266
with respect to position
times the position scalar product.

362
00:21:55,318 --> 00:21:58,038
This is a vector,
this is a scalar product.

363
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:06,151
So this produces a changing magnetic field
and that is spatially dependent.

364
00:22:06,151 --> 00:22:07,977
It is static, it's not time variant

365
00:22:08,397 --> 00:22:10,487
and we can assume
that we have an image voxel

366
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:13,258
and in that image voxel
we don't have a perfect <i>B0.</i>

367
00:22:14,398 --> 00:22:18,287
So we have a distribution
of magnetic fields in that voxel

368
00:22:18,287 --> 00:22:19,978
of our image.

369
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:23,740
So what happens now,
this basically means

370
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:27,387
that if we have a <i>dBz</i> along that,

371
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:30,555
then basically what we've drawn here
the gradient as zero,

372
00:22:30,555 --> 00:22:32,115
it's actually not truly at zero.

373
00:22:32,115 --> 00:22:33,567
There is a little offset here

374
00:22:33,567 --> 00:22:39,415
that is caused by this term <i>dBz</i> times <i>z.</i>

375
00:22:39,647 --> 00:22:45,756
Same for <i>x</i> so this is <i>dBz </i>
derived by <i>x</i> times <i>x</i>

376
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:48,426
and the same for <i>y</i>, the <i>y</i> direction.

377
00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:51,942
We're here just thinking about
a particular voxel.

378
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:57,898
So now our magnetization at time <i>TE,</i>
the signal here our echo at this time,

379
00:22:58,358 --> 00:23:01,294
is given by the magnetization
just after the pulse,

380
00:23:01,294 --> 00:23:07,506
we'll assume we have perfect refocusing
of the slice selection,

381
00:23:07,644 --> 00:23:12,233
then we have <i>e to the minus i gamma</i>
from zero to <i>TE.</i>

382
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:15,715
The effect of the gradient actually 
can include the slice here as well.

383
00:23:15,729 --> 00:23:18,898
This will be nullified
but we have the effect of the gradient

384
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,182
and we have seen that
the phase term

385
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:27,440
is proportional to the time integral
of the gradient of <i>T</i> times <i>r.</i>

386
00:23:28,709 --> 00:23:34,331
And then we have the term here from
the static field,

387
00:23:34,677 --> 00:23:36,984
<i>e to the minus i gamma,</i>

388
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,699
again integrated from zero
to <i>TE delta B of r dT.</i>

389
00:23:41,701 --> 00:23:45,999
That's our deviation
that's producing also a phase.

390
00:23:45,999 --> 00:23:48,914
So we have-- we are not perfectly
at the Larmor frequency now

391
00:23:48,914 --> 00:23:52,480
for at a given position <i>r</i>

392
00:23:52,510 --> 00:23:56,212
and then we have the <i>T2</i> effect here.

393
00:23:56,808 --> 00:24:00,563
So what this means now is that
if you look at this term

394
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:03,112
this is an area, 
this is the area under the gradient,

395
00:24:03,112 --> 00:24:06,692
the effect of the phase,
this is also an area on the gradient

396
00:24:06,692 --> 00:24:09,974
because we can write 
this as a gradient just like here

397
00:24:09,974 --> 00:24:13,400
but now it's a static gradient
that doesn't vary in time, it's constant.

398
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:14,399
And so essentially,

399
00:24:14,399 --> 00:24:17,348
we have now the phase effect
of the static imperfection

400
00:24:18,107 --> 00:24:21,899
and in addition to
the effect of the gradient.

401
00:24:24,883 --> 00:24:28,618
And now we're going to be concerned
with the effect of this gradient.

402
00:24:30,098 --> 00:24:32,166
We can write this now.

403
00:24:32,747 --> 00:24:36,434
Empirically what one typically writes
that this is equals given to,

404
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:40,165
actually this is the integral
directly evaluated

405
00:24:40,165 --> 00:24:42,570
so <i>delta B</i> does not change with time

406
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,035
so <i>delta B</i> times <i>TE,</i>
that's the phase effect.

407
00:24:46,139 --> 00:24:48,037
And so now what we are going to do
to understand

408
00:24:48,037 --> 00:24:50,922
what is the effect of this area here,

409
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,039
the blue area in the three directions.

410
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,503
We're going to use the feature
that I introduced last week

411
00:24:56,503 --> 00:25:01,471
and that is that a gradient applied
simultaneously or sequentially

412
00:25:02,011 --> 00:25:05,726
before the echo has the same effect
on the echo phase.

413
00:25:06,529 --> 00:25:12,465
So what we're going to use now here
is that the <i>gamma delta B</i> times<i> TE,</i>

414
00:25:12,465 --> 00:25:13,620
I can write this as:

415
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,670
<i>gamma</i> times <i>n</i> times <i>delta B</i>
times <i>TE</i> over <i>n.</i>

416
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:20,381
You see I multiplied by <i>n</i>
and divided by <i>n.</i>

417
00:25:20,848 --> 00:25:24,061
What does this mean here is
now I can pretend to like

418
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:28,374
I'm implying an <i>n</i> times bigger
static field homogeneity

419
00:25:28,374 --> 00:25:31,199
for an <i>n</i> times smaller time period.

420
00:25:31,368 --> 00:25:34,395
The effect on the phase will be the same.

421
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,951
You can verify this term is in here.

422
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:41,920
The <i>n</i> cancels out so mathematically
it has no influence on the image phase

423
00:25:41,920 --> 00:25:43,885
but we can easily visualize this.

424
00:25:44,352 --> 00:25:47,787
So let's look at the phase encode gradient
which now here appears in green.

425
00:25:48,055 --> 00:25:49,501
I will do this now,

426
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:53,100
I will shorten the duration of this
inhomogeneity.

427
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,837
I'll pretend that this is only applied
for a short period of time

428
00:25:58,334 --> 00:26:01,216
and I'll increase the amplitude
by the same amount

429
00:26:01,216 --> 00:26:02,933
so it is now <i>n</i> times bigger.

430
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:04,645
The area stays the same.

431
00:26:04,659 --> 00:26:05,864
And then I will just say,

432
00:26:05,864 --> 00:26:09,391
well I can again with the properties
I introduced last week,

433
00:26:09,506 --> 00:26:14,237
we can say that this gradient

434
00:26:14,857 --> 00:26:19,489
is applied for a short time just before
the phase encode gradient.

435
00:26:19,884 --> 00:26:20,988
So what does this mean?

436
00:26:20,988 --> 00:26:24,540
So if we have a voxel where there
is a gradient along <i>y</i> in that voxel,

437
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,350
it has an effect 
on the magnetization phase

438
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:30,915
as if we had for a short time
turned on an additional gradient

439
00:26:30,915 --> 00:26:36,936
that corresponds 
to the <i>dB0</i> derived by d<i>y,</i>

440
00:26:36,936 --> 00:26:39,609
the gradient <i>y</i> static gradient times--

441
00:26:41,519 --> 00:26:44,687
as if we have turned on
a little gradient here beforehand.

442
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:47,900
We can do the same

443
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:50,245
and they'll change
the color here for the readout.

444
00:26:50,245 --> 00:26:56,062
So we have the area in orange here
will short net increase the amplitude

445
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:59,099
and now we'll move it somewhere else.

446
00:26:59,242 --> 00:27:03,407
So what do we see here now
for a perfectly balanced imaging sequence

447
00:27:03,407 --> 00:27:08,247
we see that the area here is the same
so the area the echo will be here.

448
00:27:08,465 --> 00:27:13,906
Now the effect of this inhomogeneity
is to have a changing the area here.

449
00:27:13,906 --> 00:27:17,184
This is of course a huge exaggeration here
these effects.

450
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:22,472
But the effect here of the inhomogeneity
is to introduce additional dephasing

451
00:27:22,578 --> 00:27:27,459
and this will change a little bit
the position of the echo.

452
00:27:27,459 --> 00:27:30,793
So not much to worry about.

453
00:27:32,015 --> 00:27:36,726
However we have the <i>z</i> gradient,
we'll do the same thing here,

454
00:27:36,726 --> 00:27:39,351
so we'll shorten the duration,

455
00:27:39,351 --> 00:27:43,231
we'll just mimic again
the effect of the long time period.

456
00:27:43,407 --> 00:27:47,098
We'll pretend that the effect
of the static gradient here

457
00:27:48,171 --> 00:27:51,007
is being described by something
that is much shorter

458
00:27:51,007 --> 00:27:53,313
but has <i>n</i> times larger amplitudes.

459
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,414
So I'll do this, I'll shorten it,
increase the amplitude

460
00:27:56,414 --> 00:27:58,311
and I'll put it somewhere else.

461
00:27:59,026 --> 00:28:01,848
What is happening here is
now we've had said

462
00:28:01,848 --> 00:28:05,745
we need to have the area of this gradient
equal to the area of this gradient.

463
00:28:05,861 --> 00:28:10,042
Now the static inhomogeneity
is changing the area of this gradient

464
00:28:10,042 --> 00:28:13,057
because it's in this direction
and so now we no longer have

465
00:28:13,057 --> 00:28:15,964
perfect refocusing 
of magnetization along <i>z.</i>

466
00:28:16,259 --> 00:28:18,410
So we no longer have maximum signal.

467
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:21,652
This gradient reduces our amplitude,

468
00:28:21,754 --> 00:28:25,483
this gradient and the redirection
shifts the echo time,

469
00:28:25,549 --> 00:28:27,004
usually it's not perceptible.

470
00:28:27,129 --> 00:28:29,855
And the gray in phase encode direction,

471
00:28:29,965 --> 00:28:35,615
this additional gradient here
will introduce a phase encode

472
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:40,131
an additional dephasing
can be substantial.

473
00:28:40,782 --> 00:28:45,429
So we have as a result, 
we have a reduction in signal amplitude.

474
00:28:45,931 --> 00:28:47,183
And this we can verify,

475
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,949
we'll take this expression here
that we've had

476
00:28:49,949 --> 00:28:52,910
and we'll now sum the magnetization
over one voxel.

477
00:28:53,719 --> 00:28:56,543
So the <i>e to the minus TE</i>
over <i>T2</i> is constant,

478
00:28:56,543 --> 00:28:57,528
We'll take it out.

479
00:28:57,528 --> 00:29:02,470
It's a three dimensional integral
over the voxel times this phase term

480
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:03,831
over the echo time.

481
00:29:03,831 --> 00:29:06,998
That's the effect of the phase
of this term here.

482
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:09,238
We'll assume that 
all this gradients have cancelled

483
00:29:09,238 --> 00:29:11,492
because we're exactly measuring here.

484
00:29:11,604 --> 00:29:17,847
So now this term here produces
a dephasing integrated over the voxel

485
00:29:17,847 --> 00:29:21,331
so we have all sorts of different
precessional frequencies in our voxel.

486
00:29:21,574 --> 00:29:25,195
This will create a dephasing
that increases with <i>TE</i>

487
00:29:25,195 --> 00:29:27,602
and therefore a reduction in signal.

488
00:29:28,405 --> 00:29:30,408
Now what one does here is very
empirical.

489
00:29:30,408 --> 00:29:33,808
We'll just say, well the signal actually
is still decaying exponentially

490
00:29:33,808 --> 00:29:36,098
but now with 
a time constant <i>T2</i>*,

491
00:29:36,098 --> 00:29:38,882
we'll call this 
time constant <i>T2</i>*.

492
00:29:40,031 --> 00:29:44,744
So empirically there's a relationship
between <i>T2 star and T2</i>,

493
00:29:44,836 --> 00:29:48,557
so one over <i>T2 star</i> is equal to
one over <i>T2 plus gamma delta B.</i>

494
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:52,030
<i>Delta B</i> is always considered to be
a positive term,

495
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:54,825
gamma is positive so this is-- 
the right side is bigger.

496
00:29:54,843 --> 00:29:59,318
If the right side is bigger than <i>T2</i><i>,
then </i>T2*<i> is smaller than </i>T2.

497
00:29:59,444 --> 00:30:01,927
Or <i>T2</i> is longer than <i>T2</i>*.

498
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:06,807
So <i>delta B</i> is here really 
an empirical parameter, a flux parameter

499
00:30:06,807 --> 00:30:09,299
that just describes the degree
of inhomogeneities

500
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:12,500
but it is a way to quantify
the inhomogeneities

501
00:30:12,599 --> 00:30:14,378
that are present in the voxel.

502
00:30:15,554 --> 00:30:19,324
So to summarize the effect of
static inhomogeneities,

503
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:25,313
imperfections in the static magnetic field
creates a faster decay of the signal

504
00:30:25,313 --> 00:30:27,854
is faster than pure <i>T2</i>

505
00:30:28,211 --> 00:30:33,731
and also an opportunity
for additional contrast,

506
00:30:33,731 --> 00:30:35,895
which we'll see in the next section.
