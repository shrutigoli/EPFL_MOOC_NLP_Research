1
00:00:04,503 --> 00:00:05,755
Okay, so spin echo,

2
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:09,985
and this is actually a consequence
of using two RF pulses.

3
00:00:09,985 --> 00:00:13,395
Irving Hahn observed this
in the early '50s,

4
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:17,595
that when using two RF pulses,
then there is an echo observed

5
00:00:17,595 --> 00:00:19,755
at twice the time difference,

6
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:22,495
and this happens in the presence
of a constant gradient.

7
00:00:23,505 --> 00:00:26,385
You might ask, "In the 1950s,
they did not have gradients;

8
00:00:26,385 --> 00:00:27,965
how come this was observed?"

9
00:00:27,965 --> 00:00:29,505
Well, actually, at the time,

10
00:00:29,505 --> 00:00:33,145
the quality of the magnets,
as they were used, was so poor

11
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:35,775
that they actually were like a...

12
00:00:36,131 --> 00:00:40,691
The B0 really was not constant,
was not homogeneous,

13
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:43,641
so there was a big gradient
inside the magnet.

14
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:45,414
So we'll look here at time.

15
00:00:46,065 --> 00:00:48,155
We'll now pretend that we've turned on

16
00:00:48,155 --> 00:00:50,925
the gradient along Y, and it is always on.

17
00:00:50,925 --> 00:00:52,795
So we'll just consider it is always on.

18
00:00:52,795 --> 00:00:54,315
We'll have a 90¬∞ pulse.

19
00:00:54,535 --> 00:00:57,765
This 90¬∞ pulse, the B1,
is applied along the X axis,

20
00:00:57,765 --> 00:01:02,525
so it rotates the magnetization
onto the Y axis.

21
00:01:02,863 --> 00:01:05,763
After a certain time,
we will apply a gradient,

22
00:01:05,763 --> 00:01:09,503
an RF pulse of twice the duration,
so it's a 180¬∞ pulse,

23
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:12,273
but this time, around the Y axis.

24
00:01:13,393 --> 00:01:15,873
This time here, we will call this TE/2,

25
00:01:15,873 --> 00:01:17,993
and we're going to look
at what's happening

26
00:01:17,993 --> 00:01:20,313
after another time TE/2.

27
00:01:21,099 --> 00:01:25,159
And at this point, actually,
we will observe a spin echo.

28
00:01:25,507 --> 00:01:27,257
So I'll take here the graphic

29
00:01:28,496 --> 00:01:33,086
What happens with the magnetization
where, after the 90¬∞ pulse,

30
00:01:33,086 --> 00:01:37,516
we have the magnetization flipped
into the transverse plane; it's along Y.

31
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:39,606
So it's a 90¬∞ pulse along X.

32
00:01:39,606 --> 00:01:42,796
The magnetization is all in phase along Y.

33
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:46,439
And now we're going to look
at what's happening over time.

34
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:49,510
And we're going to look
at the magnetization vector

35
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,670
in complex space,
so the X magnetization component

36
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,250
is, for example, imaginary,
and the Y is real.

37
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,770
It doesn't really matter
what we're using here.

38
00:02:00,143 --> 00:02:03,213
So we have magnetization here,

39
00:02:03,213 --> 00:02:06,153
and I'll just draw four
random magnetizations.

40
00:02:06,423 --> 00:02:09,823
They have different Larmor frequencies,

41
00:02:09,823 --> 00:02:12,973
and/or different signs
of the Larmor frequency.

42
00:02:12,973 --> 00:02:15,953
All in, of course,
the rotating reference frame.

43
00:02:16,399 --> 00:02:18,579
So after the 90¬∞ pulse,

44
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:21,499
all the magnetization is collinear,

45
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:24,972
and now, what happens
during the time period is dephasing.

46
00:02:24,972 --> 00:02:26,932
We'll have two vectors going to the left,

47
00:02:26,932 --> 00:02:28,622
and two vectors going to the right,

48
00:02:28,622 --> 00:02:32,962
and this is what's happening
during the first TE/2.

49
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:37,926
So it's dephasing, depending
on their position along Y,

50
00:02:37,926 --> 00:02:40,776
depending on...

51
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:43,632
they will precess positive or negative,

52
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:46,242
and with different Larmor frequencies.

53
00:02:46,242 --> 00:02:49,972
So after TE/2, we have
these four magnetization vectors,

54
00:02:49,972 --> 00:02:51,522
that are spread out.

55
00:02:51,962 --> 00:02:55,402
So this is a situation <i>b</i>
that we have here,

56
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:57,242
just before the 180¬∞ pulse.

57
00:02:57,242 --> 00:02:59,972
They have spread out
between fast and slow.

58
00:03:00,962 --> 00:03:03,752
And now, what we are going to do,

59
00:03:03,752 --> 00:03:08,052
is we are going to apply
the 180¬∞ pulse along Y.

60
00:03:08,052 --> 00:03:11,832
So we're going to apply
the RF pulse along the Y axis.

61
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:13,532
What does this do?

62
00:03:16,382 --> 00:03:17,262
Did you see?

63
00:03:17,502 --> 00:03:18,522
Let's do it again.

64
00:03:18,522 --> 00:03:21,522
It flips the X component
of the magnetization.

65
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:23,862
An RF pulse that rotates around the Y axis

66
00:03:23,862 --> 00:03:26,972
will leave the Y component intact.

67
00:03:26,972 --> 00:03:28,062
We'll go back.

68
00:03:28,062 --> 00:03:29,512
This is before the pulse.

69
00:03:30,102 --> 00:03:33,162
And now, after the pulse,
the X components

70
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:35,382
have changed the sign for the vectors.

71
00:03:35,732 --> 00:03:40,762
So orange and blue on the right,
red and green on the left,

72
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,255
And now, red and green are on the right,
and orange and blue on the left.

73
00:03:44,255 --> 00:03:45,695
The Y components are the same,

74
00:03:45,695 --> 00:03:48,445
but the X components
have changed the sign.

75
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,931
So this is the situation here,
just after the RF pulse now.

76
00:03:53,442 --> 00:03:56,772
So if we look at what happens
with the RF pulse,

77
00:03:57,382 --> 00:04:00,192
we only changed
the X component, the sign,

78
00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:02,512
so that we have transverse magnetization,

79
00:04:02,512 --> 00:04:05,822
at a certain position,
for any of the four magnetizations.

80
00:04:05,822 --> 00:04:09,512
We only changed the X components,
so the X component changes sign.

81
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,970
So now, the phase.

82
00:04:13,258 --> 00:04:15,768
And the phase can be the effect
of the gradient here,

83
00:04:15,768 --> 00:04:18,138
so it's ùõæ G·µß y TE/2.

84
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:21,758
So this is the duration,
times the gradient, times ùõæ,

85
00:04:21,758 --> 00:04:24,758
times the position,
that gives us the total phase.

86
00:04:26,395 --> 00:04:28,525
And now, what we are going to do,

87
00:04:28,525 --> 00:04:30,623
we're going to look
what happens from now on.

88
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:35,759
And we remember blue and orange
move faster in this direction.

89
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,759
Red and green move in this direction.

90
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:41,569
So if I go back, red and green
moved in this direction.

91
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:43,479
Blue and orange moved in this direction.

92
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:45,259
So we're going to redo this,

93
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:46,759
because they are going to keep

94
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:49,797
their precession, orientation and speed,

95
00:04:49,797 --> 00:04:53,087
and as we do that, going from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>,

96
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:57,347
they continue to go
with the same precessional frequency,

97
00:04:57,347 --> 00:04:59,681
but in the end,
all the magnetization vectors

98
00:04:59,681 --> 00:05:02,981
will align themselves
and be collinear again,

99
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:05,521
and hence form an echo,

100
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:07,796
and this is called a spin echo.

101
00:05:08,752 --> 00:05:13,502
So if we look at this in complex terms,

102
00:05:13,502 --> 00:05:15,512
so we have the transverse magnetization,

103
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:17,852
we have this phase before the 180¬∞,

104
00:05:17,852 --> 00:05:19,982
so the influence
of the inhomogeneities here,

105
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:21,062
before the 180¬∞.

106
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:24,772
The 180¬∞, from this expression,

107
00:05:24,772 --> 00:05:27,252
we can also write
the transverse mutation complex

108
00:05:27,252 --> 00:05:31,982
as a transverse, times e <i>‚Äæ‚Å±</i> ·µ†.

109
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:35,752
So it basically pretends
as if the RF pulse

110
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:40,862
does as if the inhomogeneity
that has been applied

111
00:05:40,862 --> 00:05:44,074
is switching its sign here.

112
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:46,444
This is, if you want to make the link

113
00:05:46,444 --> 00:05:48,884
to the gradient echo
that we've discussed last week.

114
00:05:48,884 --> 00:05:51,614
And this week, then, your 180¬∞ pulse,

115
00:05:51,614 --> 00:05:52,994
in this scheme here, acts

116
00:05:52,994 --> 00:05:55,994
as if all the inhomogeneities
that are static here

117
00:05:55,994 --> 00:05:58,254
are changing their sign in here.

118
00:05:58,254 --> 00:05:59,784
Of course, they're not doing it,

119
00:05:59,784 --> 00:06:02,514
but we can, to understand
how this echo is done

120
00:06:02,514 --> 00:06:07,264
from this expression here,
we can pretend as if this was happening.

121
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:09,404
So it's a gedanken experiment.

122
00:06:10,897 --> 00:06:14,137
So this, in terms of phase evolution,

123
00:06:14,137 --> 00:06:16,267
it's as if the static gradient

124
00:06:16,267 --> 00:06:19,507
was with the 180¬∞, was flipping its sign.

125
00:06:21,207 --> 00:06:24,247
Okay, so I want to revisit
the spin echo formation.

126
00:06:24,247 --> 00:06:27,887
We had a graphical argument
why we have echo formation

127
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:29,867
with a 90¬∞, 180¬∞ pulse,

128
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,437
and I want to take here
a more mathematical approach.

129
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:35,967
So we'll have the RF field.
We'll do a flip angle Œ±.

130
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:38,971
We have a gradient along X.

131
00:06:39,841 --> 00:06:41,961
And we'll look at the time point 1.

132
00:06:41,961 --> 00:06:45,641
At the time point 1,
we just have Z magnetization,

133
00:06:45,641 --> 00:06:47,951
so this is our magnetization vector.

134
00:06:48,961 --> 00:06:50,951
Then we rotate it by Œ± degrees.

135
00:06:51,395 --> 00:06:53,265
So at this time point 2,

136
00:06:53,265 --> 00:06:59,685
we have the magnetization
is M‚íµ sin Œ±, and M‚íµ cos Œ±.

137
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:03,627
And now we'll just consider the terms
of our components, so 0 and M·µß.

138
00:07:03,627 --> 00:07:05,807
We just have M·µß magnetization,

139
00:07:05,807 --> 00:07:08,957
because we're not concerned
with the effect of the flip angle here.

140
00:07:09,977 --> 00:07:14,047
And now we'll look at just
the magnetization in a transverse plane,

141
00:07:14,047 --> 00:07:16,077
which presents us now
with a magnetic field

142
00:07:16,077 --> 00:07:18,507
that's given by ùõæ G‚Çì x.

143
00:07:18,743 --> 00:07:20,543
So here's our gradient, G‚Çì.

144
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:25,761
We have the echo time TE.
We'll look at time number 3.

145
00:07:25,761 --> 00:07:30,951
So at time number 3, we have now
a precession of the magnetization,

146
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:36,959
so the X component increases with cosine,

147
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:39,691
the Y component with sine, or vice versa.

148
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:41,911
And so, we have expressed it here

149
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:46,507
that the M·µß component's given
by (cos œï‚Çì) and (sin œï‚Çì).

150
00:07:47,947 --> 00:07:50,747
Now the 180¬∞ pulse inverts

151
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:52,647
the Y component of the magnetization,

152
00:07:52,647 --> 00:07:56,067
so M·µß becomes -M·µß at this point.

153
00:07:56,887 --> 00:07:58,537
And so, we can now write this

154
00:07:58,537 --> 00:08:02,967
as M·µß [cos (œï‚Çì) -sin (œï‚Çì)],

155
00:08:02,967 --> 00:08:09,957
or M·µß [(cos -œï‚Çì) and sin (-œï‚Çì)].

156
00:08:10,237 --> 00:08:14,217
So this is essentially identical
to the effect of a negative gradient,

157
00:08:14,747 --> 00:08:16,787
like we have argued last week,

158
00:08:17,127 --> 00:08:21,437
and therefore, it produces an echo.

159
00:08:24,117 --> 00:08:28,467
So the signal decays,
and in general, one considers

160
00:08:28,467 --> 00:08:30,517
that the signal decays exponentially,

161
00:08:30,517 --> 00:08:33,247
due to T‚ÇÇ or T‚ÇÇ* relaxation.

162
00:08:33,247 --> 00:08:35,447
And what is the link between the two?

163
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,187
So, if we have
the transverse magnetization here,

164
00:08:38,753 --> 00:08:41,753
then we have T‚ÇÇ --
that's the decay with T‚ÇÇ, --

165
00:08:41,753 --> 00:08:46,763
and the decay with T‚ÇÇ*,
with a gradient echo, is faster.

166
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:48,953
T‚ÇÇ* is always shorter than T‚ÇÇ.

167
00:08:49,253 --> 00:08:52,943
So if we use gradient echo for refocusing,
we have T‚ÇÇ* effects.

168
00:08:52,943 --> 00:08:56,253
If we use spin echo--90¬∞, 180¬∞--

169
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:59,243
then we have the T‚ÇÇ effect.

170
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:03,961
The two are always linked,
due to the imperfect [magnetic] field

171
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:07,771
in a given boxel--
this term is never exactly 0.

172
00:09:08,251 --> 00:09:12,951
And this is unavoidable in practice,

173
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:19,509
since a magnetic field,
in an object of finite dimensions,

174
00:09:19,509 --> 00:09:21,499
and complex anatomy, like we are,

175
00:09:21,499 --> 00:09:26,639
The B0 that is in the body
is never perfectly homogeneous,

176
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:32,257
however, this unavoidable effect
is also exploited in BOLD fMRI

177
00:09:32,497 --> 00:09:34,517
like we have just discussed.

178
00:09:35,747 --> 00:09:37,907
So now we come
to the next imaging sequence,

179
00:09:37,907 --> 00:09:41,967
at the last one that I want
to introduce here,

180
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:43,777
in terms of spin physics.

181
00:09:43,777 --> 00:09:45,957
That's the spin echo sequence.

182
00:09:45,957 --> 00:09:49,507
So we have RF excitation of the slice,

183
00:09:49,507 --> 00:09:52,917
so this is just like we have had
for the gradient echo.

184
00:09:55,497 --> 00:09:57,780
We have had the dephasing of the gradient,

185
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,240
the rephasing of the gradient,

186
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:01,000
and now we have the 180¬∞ pulse,

187
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,370
and here the gradient is just placed
symmetrically around the 180¬∞ pulse,

188
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,730
as we have seen
in the previous two slides,

189
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,460
symmetric placement of a static gradient

190
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:13,170
will produce no dephasing

191
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:15,820
of the magnetization
around a 180¬∞ pulse.

192
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,900
For the frequency encode gradient,

193
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,280
which here in this example,
we'll presume it's along x,

194
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,010
we have the dephaser.

195
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:24,110
It's now before the 180¬∞ pulse,

196
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:28,250
so now the dephaser has
the same amplitude, or the same sign,

197
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,310
as the frequency encode gradient,

198
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:33,580
unlike the gradient echo
when it was negative, beforehand,

199
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,920
this is now positive,
in the same direction

200
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,610
as the frequency encode gradient.

201
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:40,800
That has again to do
with the fact that we have

202
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,790
the 180¬∞ pulse in between.

203
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:49,030
So this area, and the placement
of the 180¬∞ pulses together,

204
00:10:49,030 --> 00:10:54,631
that defines the echo time TE
for this sequence.

205
00:10:54,631 --> 00:10:58,501
We have then the signal,
the echo that is being recorded,

206
00:10:58,501 --> 00:11:00,711
and finally, we have
the phase encode gradient,

207
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:04,391
along Y in this particular example,
applied for example here,

208
00:11:04,391 --> 00:11:10,331
which induces the phase encoding
for the second dimension.

209
00:11:10,331 --> 00:11:14,331
This is, of course,
applied every TR seconds,

210
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:19,331
and so, this is what
the spin echo sequence looks like.

211
00:11:19,331 --> 00:11:21,514
So very similar to the gradient echo,

212
00:11:21,514 --> 00:11:23,894
the fact that the 180¬∞ pulse is here

213
00:11:23,894 --> 00:11:28,374
changes the sign of the readout gradient,

214
00:11:28,374 --> 00:11:31,154
and the signal is now influenced

215
00:11:31,154 --> 00:11:33,514
by T‚ÇÇ, and not T‚ÇÇ*.

216
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:36,223
So, if we look now at the signal,

217
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:39,123
and the signal's proportional
to the transverse magnetization,

218
00:11:39,123 --> 00:11:41,033
for proton density œÅ,

219
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:45,313
this is proportional
to the equilibrium magnetization.

220
00:11:45,313 --> 00:11:48,473
Now we'll just consider 90¬∞ pulses here,

221
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:51,403
so the transverse magnetization,
at this point,

222
00:11:51,403 --> 00:11:56,003
is equal to Z magnetization
just before the RF pulse, times sin 90¬∞.

223
00:11:56,993 --> 00:12:00,113
At the time TE,
the transverse magnetization

224
00:12:00,113 --> 00:12:05,271
is given by the transverse magnetization
here, times e‚Äæ·µÄ·¥±/·µÄ‚ÇÇ ,

225
00:12:05,651 --> 00:12:08,441
and the Z magnetization
just before the pulse,

226
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:11,261
which is the last parameter
that we need to understand here,

227
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:16,511
is 1- e‚Äæ·µÄ·¥ø/·µÄ‚ÇÅ * M‚ÇÄ.

228
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:22,385
Those are the longitudinal coherence
parameters for 90¬∞ pulse excitation

229
00:12:22,385 --> 00:12:27,165
and you can look that up
in lectures 9 and 10,

230
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:29,755
when we dealt with this situation.

231
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,500
So this is, for this 90¬∞/180¬∞ sequence,
the signal behavior.

232
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,630
So as we repeat this every TR seconds,

233
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,840
we have to acquire an image,
we have to repeat it every TR seconds

234
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:46,000
to produce a 2-D image.

235
00:12:46,256 --> 00:12:48,366
So our signal now becomes a function

236
00:12:48,366 --> 00:12:50,966
of the experimental parameter TE, TR.

237
00:12:51,516 --> 00:12:56,756
It is proportional
to the proton density M‚ÇÄ times <i>e</i> ‚Äæ...

238
00:12:56,756 --> 00:12:59,366
this term here,
that's longitudinal coherence,

239
00:12:59,366 --> 00:13:02,366
and this is the decay
of the signal, due to T‚ÇÇ,

240
00:13:02,756 --> 00:13:05,006
for the spin echo sequence.

241
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:08,496
And we'll work now
through the basic contrasts.

242
00:13:09,761 --> 00:13:12,241
How do we take from this equation here,

243
00:13:12,241 --> 00:13:13,751
which has a number of terms,

244
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:16,751
how do we produce
the three basic contrasts,

245
00:13:16,751 --> 00:13:18,831
proton density, T‚ÇÅ-weighted imaging,

246
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:20,911
and T‚ÇÇ-weighted imaging,

247
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,790
that I introduced at the beginning?
