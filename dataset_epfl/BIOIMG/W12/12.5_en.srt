1
00:00:04,747 --> 00:00:08,657
So how do contrast agents work for MRI?

2
00:00:08,657 --> 00:00:13,106
Remember, we had discussed contrast agents
for computed tomography

3
00:00:13,106 --> 00:00:15,308
that they change 
the effectiveness of tissue

4
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:18,299
and therefore the linear continuation 
coefficient.

5
00:00:18,568 --> 00:00:22,506
And so how does a contrast agent MRI work?

6
00:00:22,506 --> 00:00:25,740
And essentially we distinguish 
two classes of contrast agents.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:29,689
The one are those that act on <i>T_1</i>,
it's paramagnetic agents.

8
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:32,907
These paramagnetic agents--

9
00:00:32,907 --> 00:00:35,427
the interaction as it is done 
is very complex.

10
00:00:35,427 --> 00:00:36,758
It's difficult to understand,

11
00:00:36,758 --> 00:00:39,118
but essentially the picture 
that we have is,

12
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:45,448
it is an interaction of the contrast agent
with surrounding water,

13
00:00:45,448 --> 00:00:49,088
it's own molecular tumbling 
and how fast the water diffuses

14
00:00:49,088 --> 00:00:53,740
and how close the [lot] diffuses 
close to that paramagnetic agent.

15
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,948
So, that's the molecular picture.

16
00:00:56,948 --> 00:01:00,895
Phenomenologically, 
the way they are scribed is that

17
00:01:00,895 --> 00:01:04,929
one over <i>T_1</i> in the presence 
of the contrast agent

18
00:01:04,929 --> 00:01:08,179
is given by one over <i>T1</i> in the absence 
of the contrast agent

19
00:01:08,179 --> 00:01:12,148
plus a term that is 
the contrast agent concentration

20
00:01:12,148 --> 00:01:14,178
times this factor <i>r_1</i>,

21
00:01:14,178 --> 00:01:19,769
and this factor <i>r_1</i> is the relaxivity 
of the this contrast agent on <i>T_1</i>.

22
00:01:19,769 --> 00:01:23,760
It, in a way, describes what concentration
of contrast agent one needs

23
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,979
to generate a change in <i>T_1</i>.

24
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,600
So it is a phenomenological equation, 
and we'll stick with this.

25
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,065
So, to give you an idea 
for a typical parameter here,

26
00:01:33,065 --> 00:01:35,659
if you take a contrast agent concentration
of a millimolar,

27
00:01:36,216 --> 00:01:38,917
relaxivity of 3 per millimolar per second

28
00:01:38,917 --> 00:01:41,396
and <i>T_1</i> of the tissue

29
00:01:41,405 --> 00:01:43,597
in the absence of the contrast agent 
one second

30
00:01:43,597 --> 00:01:46,395
then we can plug these numbers in,

31
00:01:46,395 --> 00:01:50,515
and we'll actually calculate that 
the <i>T_1</i> in the presence of one millimolar

32
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:52,238
of this particular contrast agent

33
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:56,938
changes from one second 
to 250 milliseconds

34
00:01:56,938 --> 00:01:59,099
followed by a factor of four.

35
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:01,170
This is huge change in <i>T_1</i>.

36
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:03,559
Imagine you're doing your image

37
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:08,888
at a <i>TR</i> of 250 milliseconds,

38
00:02:09,688 --> 00:02:12,556
the <i>T_1</i> of one second, 
this will create a very dark image

39
00:02:12,556 --> 00:02:13,879
but then you're close here

40
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:16,759
to the optimal repetition time 
at this point

41
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:20,699
and the image, the signal intensity,
will increase drastically.

42
00:02:20,893 --> 00:02:22,124
So if we look at the signal

43
00:02:22,124 --> 00:02:23,952
and now in this case we need to take 
some <i>T_1</i> weighted images

44
00:02:24,122 --> 00:02:27,414
proportional to <i>x</i> magnetization, 
so it's <i>T_1</i> weighted.

45
00:02:27,414 --> 00:02:29,673
We're looking at this expression here

46
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:32,022
and we have assumed here 
for the experiment

47
00:02:32,022 --> 00:02:34,794
that the <i>TE</i> is much shorter than <i>T_2</i>.

48
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:37,123
This is in the absence 
of the contrast agent

49
00:02:37,123 --> 00:02:38,945
and in the presence of the contrast agent,

50
00:02:38,945 --> 00:02:42,485
the recovery to thermodynamic equilibrium 
is much faster,

51
00:02:42,485 --> 00:02:46,285
so if we measure at a relatively short <i>TR</i>

52
00:02:46,285 --> 00:02:49,935
the signal becomes bright
in the presence of the contrast agent.

53
00:02:49,935 --> 00:02:51,214
So this paramagnetic agents,

54
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:54,535
they lead to a brighter signal 
of <i>T_1</i> weighted images.

55
00:02:55,545 --> 00:02:57,184
The other class of contrast agents

56
00:02:57,184 --> 00:02:59,694
are paramagnetic 
and susceptibility agents,

57
00:02:59,694 --> 00:03:02,225
they act on <i>T_2</i> and <i>T_2</i>*,

58
00:03:02,225 --> 00:03:05,275
and the <i>T`-2</i>* agents are called 
susceptibility agents.

59
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:06,974
So if we look here--

60
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:11,222
actually the expression that describes 
the effect on <i>T_2</i>*

61
00:03:11,912 --> 00:03:15,152
has the same expression 
that we have for <i>T_1</i>,

62
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:18,172
it's the effect 
of the contrast agent concentration

63
00:03:18,172 --> 00:03:21,021
but now we have the proportionality here

64
00:03:21,021 --> 00:03:23,739
is the relativity of <i>r_2</i>*

65
00:03:23,739 --> 00:03:27,052
So what happens with the signal 
as a function of <i>TE</i>,

66
00:03:27,052 --> 00:03:29,371
the signal is proportional 
to the transverse magnetization,

67
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:31,741
this is in the absence 
of a contrast agent,

68
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:34,310
that's <i>T_2</i>* with a gradient angle

69
00:03:34,310 --> 00:03:37,202
and in the presence of the contrast agent

70
00:03:37,202 --> 00:03:42,101
we have <i>T_2</i><i> for </i>CA<i>, 
that's this </i>T2** here,

71
00:03:42,195 --> 00:03:43,912
a faster decay.

72
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,139
So, to give you an idea,

73
00:03:46,139 --> 00:03:48,608
we take, again, a contrast agent 
concentration of a millimolar

74
00:03:48,608 --> 00:03:51,597
typical relaxivity of 50 per second 
per millimolar

75
00:03:51,597 --> 00:03:54,897
and a <i>T_2</i>* of 50 milliseconds.

76
00:03:54,897 --> 00:03:57,787
We calculate now,
and with this concentration

77
00:03:57,787 --> 00:04:02,077
we calculate that now the <i>T_2</i>* 
is 14 milliseconds.

78
00:04:02,077 --> 00:04:05,047
So we go from 50 milliseconds 
to 14 milliseconds.

79
00:04:05,047 --> 00:04:06,797
Now imagine what happens,

80
00:04:06,797 --> 00:04:09,617
you're measuring at 
a <i>TE</i> of 50 milliseconds,

81
00:04:09,617 --> 00:04:12,456
now, the contrast agent comes in 
at a concentration of a millimolar,

82
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:15,148
the <i>T_2</i>* is reduced to 14 milliseconds,

83
00:04:15,148 --> 00:04:18,848
at the <i>TE</i> of 50 milliseconds 
we no longer have a signal.

84
00:04:19,588 --> 00:04:22,599
So while you were optimal 
for the absence of a contrast agent,

85
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,888
now the signal has decayed.

86
00:04:25,478 --> 00:04:28,060
And this basically leads 
to a reduced signal

87
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,838
in the presence of the contrast agent

88
00:04:29,838 --> 00:04:32,877
for the paramagnetic 
and susceptibility agents

89
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:36,249
on <i>T_2</i> or <i>T_2</i>* weighted images,

90
00:04:36,249 --> 00:04:38,958
and that is because 
we are measuring somewhere here,

91
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,349
at a more prolonged <i>TE</i>.

92
00:04:41,349 --> 00:04:44,307
So, paramagnetic agents 
produce a brighter signal

93
00:04:44,307 --> 00:04:45,669
because they act on <i>T_1</i>,

94
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,183
paramagnetic and susceptibility agents
which act on <i>T_2</i> and <i>T_2</i>*,

95
00:04:49,312 --> 00:04:51,191
they produce reduced signal.

96
00:04:52,621 --> 00:04:54,992
So let's look at some examples 
of contrast agents.

97
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:58,165
First, some properties, 
they are typically restricted to blood,

98
00:04:58,515 --> 00:05:01,321
they are ideal to image vessels,

99
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:06,103
or leaky vessel walls, such as 
what we see in tumors and inflammation.

100
00:05:06,733 --> 00:05:09,822
So here we have an example 
of the mouse vasculature.

101
00:05:09,822 --> 00:05:12,161
We have an MRI of the mouse trunk,

102
00:05:12,161 --> 00:05:15,243
so this is before 
contrast agent application

103
00:05:15,243 --> 00:05:17,374
and this is after, 
we can see a change here,

104
00:05:17,374 --> 00:05:20,515
clearly in the trunk 
where the contrast agent has gone.

105
00:05:21,176 --> 00:05:25,614
This is an example of brain; 
there's a malignancy in the brain,

106
00:05:25,614 --> 00:05:31,034
before the contrast 
and after the contrast.

107
00:05:31,034 --> 00:05:33,909
We can see difference we can see here 
the ring that lights up,

108
00:05:33,909 --> 00:05:37,993
this tells us that there is 
a breakdown of blood/brain barrier,

109
00:05:37,993 --> 00:05:41,945
which is typical for the tumoral edge,

110
00:05:41,945 --> 00:05:45,533
still very well vascularized breakdown 
of blood/brain barrier.

111
00:05:45,533 --> 00:05:47,565
You can also see here 
a lots of the vessels,

112
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:50,009
the bright stuff that lights up,

113
00:05:50,179 --> 00:05:53,301
these are vessels that carry 
the contrast agent.

114
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:59,750
So this is a predominant way 
of enhancing leaky tissue.

115
00:06:00,474 --> 00:06:03,288
Here is now an example 
of contrast agent application--

116
00:06:03,288 --> 00:06:05,950
before contrast and after the contrast,

117
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,809
and we see here the liver,

118
00:06:07,809 --> 00:06:11,318
and the liver is now suddenly 
becoming dark.

119
00:06:11,318 --> 00:06:16,013
This is a susceptibility agent, 
it's a <i>T_2</i>* agent,

120
00:06:16,013 --> 00:06:18,589
that's iron oxide in this particular case,

121
00:06:18,589 --> 00:06:20,612
and it has produced negative contrast.

122
00:06:20,612 --> 00:06:24,290
So here we have positive contrast, 
positive contrast, positive contrast,

123
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,481
and here this example 
of a <i>T-2</i>-based paramagnetic

124
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:29,826
and susceptibility contrast agent

125
00:06:29,826 --> 00:06:33,213
like iron oxide is producing 
negative contrast,

126
00:06:33,213 --> 00:06:34,571
so signal is reduced.

127
00:06:35,571 --> 00:06:38,831
The second example 
that I want to talk about

128
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,731
are intracellular contrast agents.

129
00:06:40,731 --> 00:06:42,261
They are much harder.

130
00:06:42,261 --> 00:06:44,090
One is manganese.

131
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,780
Manganese is paramagnetic, 
it shortens the <i>T_1</i>.

132
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:50,731
It has the interesting feature 
that is transported by calcium channels

133
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:52,951
and therefore shortens the <i>T_1</i>.

134
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:58,207
So this has been used 
in, among others, in brain imaging.

135
00:06:58,207 --> 00:07:00,802
This is an image of a rodent brain,

136
00:07:00,802 --> 00:07:04,862
and we can see here very nicely 
the structure of the hippocampus,

137
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:09,527
the different areas, <i>CA3</i>, 
the dendrite areas, etc.

138
00:07:09,527 --> 00:07:13,483
corresponding to the structure 
seen in histology.

139
00:07:13,483 --> 00:07:14,584
Prior to manganese, 
this <i>T_1</i>-weighted image

140
00:07:14,584 --> 00:07:17,474
look fairly uninteresting

141
00:07:17,474 --> 00:07:21,974
after the application of manganese, 
one can see a very substantial contrast

142
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,184
which reflects the activity,

143
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:26,574
the differential activity 
of calcium channels

144
00:07:26,574 --> 00:07:28,712
in the brain by region.

145
00:07:29,432 --> 00:07:32,607
Now manganese as a contrast agent 
is not used in humans,

146
00:07:32,607 --> 00:07:35,962
it has issues of toxicity,

147
00:07:35,962 --> 00:07:43,252
but in neuroscience it has become 
a very interesting and promising tool

148
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:46,577
to look at fundamental 
neuroscience questions

149
00:07:46,577 --> 00:07:48,572
and also other questions.

150
00:07:48,572 --> 00:07:50,251
Now, another thing 
for intracellular contrast

151
00:07:50,251 --> 00:07:52,791
is a bit particular 
that I want to mention.

152
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,943
That is the imaging 
of transplanted cells, or stem cells.

153
00:07:56,733 --> 00:07:58,655
So, what is done here is,

154
00:07:58,655 --> 00:08:01,494
for example, that the cells 
that are injected

155
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:03,210
are preloaded with contrast agent.

156
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,191
So within them, they contain 
the contrast agent

157
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:09,597
and then one looks 
at the change in MRI signal

158
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:15,314
as the cells are being injected 
and then migrate within the body.

159
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:20,602
And this is an example of 
transplanted Langerhan cells in the liver,

160
00:08:20,602 --> 00:08:24,018
so lung transplantation of islets

161
00:08:25,108 --> 00:08:28,290
is a recent form of treatment 
for Type I diabetes.

162
00:08:29,241 --> 00:08:31,823
These islets are injected into the patient,

163
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:35,442
and one of the questions here was

164
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:41,492
that where do these transplanted islets 
go in the body?

165
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,856
There has been a suspicion 
that they would end up in the liver

166
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:47,326
and, indeed, what these images show here,

167
00:08:47,326 --> 00:08:49,172
here are the islets, they show up as dark

168
00:08:49,172 --> 00:08:51,699
because they are, in this case,

169
00:08:51,699 --> 00:08:56,454
they were used 
with a susceptibility contrast agent,

170
00:08:56,454 --> 00:08:59,431
so a <i>T_2</i> contrast agent or <i>T_2</i>*

171
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:03,453
and they are, indeed, showing up here 
dislodged in the liver

172
00:09:03,453 --> 00:09:10,500
where they are making their action 
on the body

173
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:13,008
by helping to secrete insulin

174
00:09:13,008 --> 00:09:17,782
and therefore reduce the effects 
of Type I diabetes in these patients.
