1
00:00:04,006 --> 00:00:07,586
So how are the basic 
MRI contrasts generated?

2
00:00:07,586 --> 00:00:11,357
So we'll start out here 
with proton density weighted MRI.

3
00:00:11,357 --> 00:00:14,488
So for proton density, 
just to have proton density,

4
00:00:14,488 --> 00:00:17,567
one wants to minimize 
the effects of the relaxation.

5
00:00:17,567 --> 00:00:21,617
So take again the basic equation 
here that we have.

6
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:25,016
The signal is a function of 
<i>TR, TE,</i> and <i>TR</i>.

7
00:00:25,016 --> 00:00:27,976
We want to minimize the effect of <i>T1</i>,

8
00:00:27,976 --> 00:00:31,558
so the <i>T1</i> here is for different tissues.

9
00:00:31,558 --> 00:00:34,717
We don't want to have 
the effect of <i>T1</i> on the signal,

10
00:00:34,717 --> 00:00:39,299
so essentially what this means is 
one wants to measure at a <i>TR</i>

11
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:42,467
that is relatively long compared to <i>T1</i>.

12
00:00:42,467 --> 00:00:46,868
So it's a long <i>TR</i>, in this example here,
it's three and a half seconds.

13
00:00:46,868 --> 00:00:49,808
That will minimize 
the effect of <i>T1</i> differences

14
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:51,937
and let's pretend we've been good at that,

15
00:00:51,937 --> 00:00:56,396
so we can, by measuring here, 
neglect the effect of <i>T1</i>.

16
00:00:56,396 --> 00:00:58,775
So we'll just say this term
here becomes one

17
00:00:58,775 --> 00:01:00,926
and we'll neglect its effect.

18
00:01:00,926 --> 00:01:04,405
So now we're left 
with the exponential decay here.

19
00:01:05,015 --> 00:01:06,855
This term here--

20
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:11,975
and I will look at the signal decaying 
as a function of <i>T2</i>.

21
00:01:11,975 --> 00:01:15,111
Again, we want to have 
no influence of <i>T2</i>,

22
00:01:15,111 --> 00:01:17,024
so to have no influence of <i>T2</i>

23
00:01:17,024 --> 00:01:19,874
we want this term 
to be essentially zero,

24
00:01:19,874 --> 00:01:22,544
<i>T</i> over <i>T2</i> is--

25
00:01:22,544 --> 00:01:25,916
we can basically say <i>TE</i> zero 
then <i>T2</i> can be whatever it is,

26
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:29,045
<i>E to the minus zero</i>
is always one.

27
00:01:29,045 --> 00:01:32,825
So the goal here is to minimize the <i>TE</i>,

28
00:01:32,825 --> 00:01:35,026
so we'll use the <i>TE</i> as short as possible,

29
00:01:35,026 --> 00:01:38,256
that minimizes the effect of <i>T2</i>

30
00:01:38,256 --> 00:01:39,787
and so this term is gone

31
00:01:39,787 --> 00:01:42,386
and in this case one has an image

32
00:01:42,386 --> 00:01:47,495
that is essentially reflecting 
the equilibrium magnetization,

33
00:01:47,495 --> 00:01:50,446
which reflects-- 
as we have introduced in lecture eight--

34
00:01:50,446 --> 00:01:53,697
which reflects a number 
of spins in a voxel.

35
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:57,176
So we're imaging the number 
of protons per voxel,

36
00:01:57,176 --> 00:01:59,126
in this particular case,

37
00:01:59,126 --> 00:02:01,416
this is the Parameter Rho.

38
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:04,166
So images with higher density, 
spin density

39
00:02:04,166 --> 00:02:09,096
like fat and CSF have 
a higher image intensity,

40
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:13,675
however, if we consider 
the contrast that this can bare,

41
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:16,236
we have to bare in mind that living tissue

42
00:02:17,536 --> 00:02:21,902
typically has water content 
that varies between 70 and 100%,

43
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:25,173
so that is not a gigantic 
difference in contrast

44
00:02:25,173 --> 00:02:27,343
between the different tissues,

45
00:02:27,343 --> 00:02:30,173
so it's not a very good--

46
00:02:31,253 --> 00:02:33,965
way to distinguish the tissues.

47
00:02:33,965 --> 00:02:35,884
Nonetheless it's the physical approach,

48
00:02:35,884 --> 00:02:37,765
we want to measure 
the density of protons,

49
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:41,115
we're measuring a quantity,
number of protons per voxel.

50
00:02:41,825 --> 00:02:44,327
This is for proton density MRI.

51
00:02:45,696 --> 00:02:48,994
So second question: 
how is <i>T2</i> contrast produced now?

52
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:52,186
We'll take again 
the same operational equation,

53
00:02:52,186 --> 00:02:55,105
that's our signal
of our spinecall sequence

54
00:02:55,105 --> 00:02:58,656
and now we are looking at the <i>T1</i> effect.

55
00:02:58,656 --> 00:03:04,216
We are now interested in producing 
a contrast solely on the basis of <i>T2</i>

56
00:03:04,216 --> 00:03:08,367
and so in this case for <i>T2</i> weighting,

57
00:03:08,367 --> 00:03:10,581
we don't want to have the effect of <i>T1</i>.

58
00:03:11,158 --> 00:03:13,768
So we're going to use long <i>TR</i>

59
00:03:13,768 --> 00:03:17,220
to have a reduced effect 
of differences in <i>T1</i>.

60
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:20,418
We are interested in exploiting 
just the effect of <i>T2</i>

61
00:03:20,418 --> 00:03:22,968
and so, again here, 
a three and a half seconds

62
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:27,768
we have a fairly long <i>T1</i>
to minimize the effect of <i>T2</i>

63
00:03:27,768 --> 00:03:29,418
and let's say this is sufficiently long

64
00:03:29,418 --> 00:03:33,928
that we are not measuring 
the influence of different <i>T1s</i>

65
00:03:33,928 --> 00:03:37,666
and so we can neglect this term 
for the following.

66
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,869
Now to measure the effect of <i>T2</i>,

67
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:43,639
one does not want to measure at a short <i>TE</i>

68
00:03:43,639 --> 00:03:45,569
because there they don't differentiate.

69
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:50,817
One wants to use a longer <i>TE</i>
to accentuate the differences in <i>T2</i>,

70
00:03:50,817 --> 00:03:52,377
so that's this term here,

71
00:03:52,377 --> 00:03:54,348
we want to accentuate 
the differences here,

72
00:03:54,348 --> 00:03:58,798
we pretended that this term is one--

73
00:03:58,798 --> 00:04:00,899
and we don't need to consider it.

74
00:04:01,921 --> 00:04:04,467
So we'll just use a particular <i>T2</i>

75
00:04:04,807 --> 00:04:09,686
and now here the issue is: 
what is the optimal <i>TE</i>

76
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:14,705
that we'll be using here 
to accentuate the <i>T2</i> differences?

77
00:04:16,885 --> 00:04:18,917
Clearly if we use a <i>TE = 0</i>

78
00:04:19,065 --> 00:04:21,876
we have no differentiation 
of the <i>T2</i> differences.

79
00:04:21,876 --> 00:04:24,316
If <i>TE</i> is very long compared to <i>T2</i>

80
00:04:24,316 --> 00:04:27,277
then we have no signal 
and we cannot differentiate,

81
00:04:27,277 --> 00:04:29,797
so there's somewhere 
in between this an optimum

82
00:04:29,797 --> 00:04:33,599
and this is done by--

83
00:04:33,599 --> 00:04:37,538
the goal here is to find the echo time 
at which the transverse magnetization

84
00:04:37,538 --> 00:04:42,176
is most strongly effected 
by the <i>T2</i> differences.

85
00:04:42,176 --> 00:04:45,147
To do this we use the same kind
of variational calculus

86
00:04:45,147 --> 00:04:49,277
or air propagation calculus 
that I introduced in lecture one

87
00:04:49,277 --> 00:04:51,069
to obtain this solution.

88
00:04:51,069 --> 00:04:52,867
So we'll do first--

89
00:04:54,077 --> 00:04:56,149
and essentially what it is, 
we'll calculate

90
00:04:56,149 --> 00:04:58,161
the derivative of 
the transverse magnetization

91
00:04:58,161 --> 00:05:00,380
with respect to <i>T2</i> that tells us

92
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:04,210
how much is the transverse magnetization 
sensitive to changes in <i>T2</i>

93
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:08,009
and then we want to know 
at what <i>TE</i> is this derivative maximum.

94
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,270
That's the approach.

95
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:11,250
I'm not going to go 
through the details here.

96
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,549
I'm just going to give you the result.

97
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:15,749
The optimum <i>TE</i> here is --

98
00:05:18,314 --> 00:05:20,487
at the value of <i>T2</i>.

99
00:05:21,114 --> 00:05:24,039
If we have tissues with different <i>T2</i>,

100
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:29,384
so <i>T2a</i> and <i>T2b</i> then most likely
the optimum <i>TE</i> to use

101
00:05:29,384 --> 00:05:31,386
for differentiating those two tissues

102
00:05:31,386 --> 00:05:34,495
is the <i>TE</i> that's between the two <i>T2</i> values

103
00:05:34,495 --> 00:05:36,844
so somewhere in between.

104
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,807
So it's automatic --

105
00:05:39,807 --> 00:05:43,548
A crucial requirement, if your <i>T2s</i>
are on the order of 100 milliseconds,

106
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:47,136
there's no point in measuring it
at 200 milliseconds,

107
00:05:47,136 --> 00:05:48,916
so you set it to 100 milliseconds.

108
00:05:48,916 --> 00:05:52,056
However, if you're in a situation 
where the <i>T2s</i> are 50 milliseconds,

109
00:05:52,056 --> 00:05:56,978
the 100 milliseconds are perhaps 
not the optimum choice <i>T2</i> weighting.

110
00:05:58,428 --> 00:06:03,187
Okay, so in this case <i>TE</i> here 
is 100 milliseconds.

111
00:06:04,228 --> 00:06:05,658
Okay and finally,

112
00:06:06,628 --> 00:06:08,297
let's discuss <i>T1</i> weighting.

113
00:06:08,297 --> 00:06:12,976
So we are looking, again, 
at the operational equation here

114
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:16,026
for the spinecall sequence, 91/80 degree

115
00:06:16,026 --> 00:06:18,687
but now we're not interested
in having the effect of <i>T2</i>.

116
00:06:18,687 --> 00:06:22,288
So we want to minimize the effect of <i>T2</i>

117
00:06:22,288 --> 00:06:27,816
and to do this, like with proton density 
weighted imaging,

118
00:06:27,816 --> 00:06:31,275
we want to have a <i>TE</i> that is 
as short as possible.

119
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:36,124
So while using a short <i>TE</i>
to minimize the effects of <i>T2</i>,

120
00:06:36,124 --> 00:06:39,046
so we'll use something here 
like 20 milliseconds

121
00:06:39,046 --> 00:06:41,129
in this particular example.

122
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:43,677
And then let's pretend 
that we've been successful

123
00:06:43,677 --> 00:06:45,548
and that our <i>TE</i> is sufficiently shorter,

124
00:06:45,548 --> 00:06:48,327
we can largely neglect the effects of <i>T2</i>,

125
00:06:48,327 --> 00:06:50,821
so we'll pretend that 
this factor here is one

126
00:06:50,821 --> 00:06:54,831
and we'll just grey it out here 
and it's no longer observable.

127
00:06:55,151 --> 00:07:00,968
So now we're interested in optimizing 
or looking at this term here

128
00:07:00,968 --> 00:07:04,688
and so the effect 
to accentuate <i>T1</i> effects,

129
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:08,189
one uses a relatively short <i>TR</i>.

130
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:11,529
If we use a <i>TR</i> that's 
very long compared to <i>T1</i>,

131
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,469
we won't have an effect of <i>T1</i>.

132
00:07:13,469 --> 00:07:16,170
If <i>TR</i> is very short compared to <i>T1</i>,

133
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:18,408
we're using 90/80 pulses here

134
00:07:18,408 --> 00:07:19,995
then we have no signal.

135
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:25,756
So there's most likely 
also here an optimum for the <i>TR</i>.

136
00:07:26,798 --> 00:07:32,319
So the idea is to use a short <i>TR</i>
to maximize the differences

137
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,139
in longitudinal magnetization

138
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:37,254
as they are returning 
to thermodynamic equilibrium,

139
00:07:37,254 --> 00:07:39,384
so we have CSF here going slow

140
00:07:39,384 --> 00:07:42,255
and we have white matter 
going much faster.

141
00:07:42,255 --> 00:07:44,945
So we'll have some differences here

142
00:07:44,945 --> 00:07:49,564
and in this particular example 
the <i>TR</i> chosen here is 600 milliseconds.

143
00:07:50,394 --> 00:07:54,876
As a consequence, tissues with short <i>T1</i>
have a higher image intensity

144
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:58,135
because they are the ones 
who are much further along

145
00:07:58,135 --> 00:08:00,405
in their return 
to thermodynamic equilibrium

146
00:08:00,405 --> 00:08:04,725
than the tissues with long <i>T1</i> such as CSF.

147
00:08:04,725 --> 00:08:07,206
So CSF appears dark.

148
00:08:07,206 --> 00:08:10,926
Now again we can ask 
what is the good choice of <i>TR</i>.

149
00:08:11,846 --> 00:08:13,298
That's the question.

150
00:08:14,078 --> 00:08:16,088
And I'll give you the answer

151
00:08:16,088 --> 00:08:19,478
because we have actually dealt 
with this already in course nine,

152
00:08:19,478 --> 00:08:22,889
and it's a similar calculation 
that I introduced in lecture one,

153
00:08:22,889 --> 00:08:25,279
and we just used on the preceding slide,

154
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:29,558
and the answer here is not surprising, 
we're dealing with an exponential return,

155
00:08:29,558 --> 00:08:35,727
that the optimal <i>TR</i>
to see <i>T1</i> changes is at the <i>TR = T1</i>

156
00:08:36,119 --> 00:08:39,301
We're not going to go 
into much of the details here.

157
00:08:40,552 --> 00:08:42,889
Let's illustrate in the following--

158
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,762
we'll illustrate 
these different contrasts.

159
00:08:46,652 --> 00:08:49,401
So here's a <i>T1</i> weighted image of the head.

160
00:08:49,401 --> 00:08:52,201
We can see the tongue here, the nose,

161
00:08:52,201 --> 00:08:54,920
this is a sectional cross, 
so here is the back of the head

162
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,780
where we have the little bump back here.

163
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:59,178
To give you an idea 
what the <i>TRs</i> and <i>Ts</i> are,

164
00:08:59,178 --> 00:09:02,380
I've put them in here, 
so this is a <i>TR</i> of 510 milliseconds

165
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,189
and a <i>TE</i> of 40 milliseconds.

166
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:09,610
Here's now a density weighted, 
proton density weighted image.

167
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,652
So it is a <i>TR</i> of four and a half seconds
and a <i>TE</i> of 50 milliseconds.

168
00:09:14,652 --> 00:09:16,911
This is a cut through the head coronally,

169
00:09:16,911 --> 00:09:19,460
so we can see the ventricles very bright,

170
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:23,070
the CSF bright 
because this is 100% water.

171
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:26,091
It's not very bright but it's bright.
It's a greyish image.

172
00:09:26,091 --> 00:09:31,338
And <i>T2</i> weighted here now, 
the <i>TR</i> is four and a half seconds

173
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:33,928
and the <i>TE</i> is 100 milliseconds.

174
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:37,997
We can see the liquid filled spaces,

175
00:09:37,997 --> 00:09:40,748
the CSF, cerebral spinal fluid 
has long <i>T2</i>.

176
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:43,647
There's no proteins, 
no membranes in there or very little,

177
00:09:43,647 --> 00:09:46,779
so <i>T2</i> is long, they show up as bright.

178
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:49,337
And so notice here that we have the fluid,

179
00:09:49,337 --> 00:09:52,028
cerebral spinal fluid here,

180
00:09:52,028 --> 00:09:54,378
here, and here.

181
00:09:54,378 --> 00:09:57,208
We have long <i>T2</i> for cerebral spinal fluid

182
00:09:57,208 --> 00:10:02,069
and long <i>T1</i> but 
the cerebral spinal fluid is darker <i>T1</i>

183
00:10:02,069 --> 00:10:05,628
because the weighting there 
favors the shorter <i>T1</i> components

184
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:08,768
whereas a <i>T2</i> weighted the imaging,

185
00:10:08,768 --> 00:10:12,619
the weighting favors 
of the long <i>T2</i> components.

186
00:10:12,619 --> 00:10:16,689
So this is, again, 
a comparison of <i>T1</i> and <i>T2</i> images

187
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:18,948
in the brain of the same subject

188
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:23,148
we have tissue filled ventricles, 
dark on <i>T1</i> weighted,

189
00:10:23,148 --> 00:10:27,309
and bright on the <i>T2</i> weighted image.

190
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:32,630
Here's an example
of a <i>T1</i> weighted image of the knee

191
00:10:32,630 --> 00:10:37,389
and this is of the muscle, 
also <i>T1</i> weighted fat

192
00:10:37,389 --> 00:10:39,288
typically has a shorter <i>T1</i>
compared to muscle,

193
00:10:39,288 --> 00:10:41,222
so we get good contrast.

194
00:10:41,222 --> 00:10:43,768
This is fat. 
This is the bone.

195
00:10:43,768 --> 00:10:48,250
And here we have the lymphoma 
in this unfortunate patient,

196
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,678
so this is showing the fat signal.

197
00:10:51,678 --> 00:10:53,962
So we have to remember for water

198
00:10:53,962 --> 00:10:57,981
that a short <i>T1</i> 
typically implies a short <i>T2</i>

199
00:10:57,981 --> 00:11:01,160
and a long <i>T1</i> implies a long <i>T2</i>.

200
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:04,779
So even though this is long <i>T2</i>

201
00:11:04,779 --> 00:11:09,519
and this is long <i>T1</i> the contrast, 
the way it appears is different

202
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,060
and this is important 
because the way

203
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:16,341
the contrast generate the MRI 
changes the appearance

204
00:11:16,341 --> 00:11:19,270
of the same signal or the same mechanism.

205
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:26,760
The second example on this is 
<i>T2</i> weighted imaging of MRI of cancer

206
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,571
and one of the features is 
that cancer tissue has a long <i>T2</i>.

207
00:11:30,571 --> 00:11:35,762
This is a metastases of colon carcinoma

208
00:11:35,762 --> 00:11:38,751
here on this <i>T2</i> weighted image 
of the abdomen.

209
00:11:38,751 --> 00:11:42,910
They are hyper intense, 
very brightly visible.

210
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,654
Here's a <i>T2</i> weighted image 
of the brain tumor.

211
00:11:46,654 --> 00:11:49,490
One can see the bright area here 
but it shouldn't be

212
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:52,490
and there's even 
some different within that,

213
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:54,091
that it looks peculiar.

214
00:11:55,148 --> 00:11:57,303
Here's an example of --

215
00:11:59,193 --> 00:12:01,194
a mouse with xenograft tumor,

216
00:12:01,194 --> 00:12:06,413
so the tumor is implanted here 
on the surface.

217
00:12:06,413 --> 00:12:08,264
This is the <i>T1</i> weighted image,

218
00:12:08,264 --> 00:12:10,554
just to give you an idea 
what the perimeters are

219
00:12:10,554 --> 00:12:13,954
500 milliseconds <i>TR</i>, 14 milliseconds <i>TE</i>.

220
00:12:13,954 --> 00:12:17,673
This is <i>T2</i> weighted here and again, 
<i>TE</i> is not 40 milliseconds,

221
00:12:17,673 --> 00:12:20,233
<i>TR</i> is two seconds.

222
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:24,058
And on the <i>T2</i> weighted image 
one can see the xenograft tumor

223
00:12:24,058 --> 00:12:26,724
is much harder to see 
on the <i>T1</i> weighted image,

224
00:12:26,724 --> 00:12:32,124
so <i>T2</i> weighted images are very often 
used to detect tumor tissue.

225
00:12:32,124 --> 00:12:37,213
Here's again, for a mouse implanted 
with tumor baring cells,

226
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:40,463
non-tumor baring cells 
in the <i>T2</i> weighted image

227
00:12:40,463 --> 00:12:46,404
clearly the tumor 
that has grown is very visible.

228
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:50,834
And now on the <i>T2</i> weighted image, 
one has very often a contrast

229
00:12:50,834 --> 00:12:54,141
that is not homogeneous for a tumor

230
00:12:58,275 --> 00:13:01,274
and what is often done 
is the application of contrast agents.

231
00:13:01,274 --> 00:13:06,205
Contrast agents which depict the breakdown
of blood-brain barrier or vasculature

232
00:13:06,205 --> 00:13:08,174
and this is now the same patient here,

233
00:13:08,174 --> 00:13:13,030
<i>T1</i> weighted image after 
the application of a contrast agent.

234
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,763
And that bares now the question 
on what are MRI contrast agents,

235
00:13:18,855 --> 00:13:20,794
which we'll discuss next.
