1
00:00:04,414 --> 00:00:09,060
So, I mentioned that photon detection
does not give us the option

2
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:12,536
to determine the directionality
of the photon.

3
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:17,305
The question here is, how can we establish
the directionality of the photon?

4
00:00:17,305 --> 00:00:19,291
How do we know where it came from?

5
00:00:20,271 --> 00:00:22,942
So, here's the situation:
we have a bunch of x-rays

6
00:00:22,942 --> 00:00:24,706
that come from the body.

7
00:00:25,006 --> 00:00:27,565
This is the x-rays,
they go in all sorts of directions

8
00:00:27,565 --> 00:00:31,209
and here would be
our detector, our camera.

9
00:00:31,209 --> 00:00:33,872
This is not a very useful situation.

10
00:00:34,782 --> 00:00:37,505
So, what we can do,
and we've already dealt with this

11
00:00:37,505 --> 00:00:41,788
two weeks ago when we talked about
x-ray imaging--I'm sorry, last week,

12
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:47,440
about CT, that we can use a
anti scatter grid

13
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,454
to eliminate photons that don't have
the right directionality.

14
00:00:51,454 --> 00:00:53,964
So, we can do the same thing here.

15
00:00:53,964 --> 00:00:57,567
We'll introduce this collimator,
which is essentially the same thing

16
00:00:57,567 --> 00:01:00,199
as a anti scatter grid,

17
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:05,574
and of the x-rays, we will only allow
to pass the x-rays that satisfy

18
00:01:05,574 --> 00:01:08,709
the geometrical condition of collinearity

19
00:01:08,709 --> 00:01:11,770
with the slates that
are in the collimator.

20
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,122
Now, this is an extreme simplification,

21
00:01:14,872 --> 00:01:19,630
but it serves to illustrate the principle
that we put in the collimator

22
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:22,826
and only x-rays 
that satisfy the collinearity

23
00:01:22,826 --> 00:01:25,836
of going from left to right, 
in this direction,

24
00:01:25,836 --> 00:01:29,383
are being passed
through in an idealized way.

25
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:33,511
The collimator typically is fairly
thick material.

26
00:01:33,741 --> 00:01:36,784
It is lead or tungsten, so it has high Z,

27
00:01:36,784 --> 00:01:40,176
it has thin holes 
and this basically establishes

28
00:01:40,176 --> 00:01:45,882
that the rays only orthogonal 
to the crystal pass into the crystal.

29
00:01:47,072 --> 00:01:48,873
What does a collimator look like?

30
00:01:48,873 --> 00:01:53,782
It is hexagonal in structure,
so these are the collimator material,

31
00:01:54,052 --> 00:01:57,597
thick material here,
and fairly long here,

32
00:01:57,597 --> 00:02:01,900
similar to the hexagonal
structure of a beehive.

33
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:07,008
So, now let's look at the scan here.

34
00:02:07,008 --> 00:02:10,813
We have a subject and we'll now
assume we just have one single detector,

35
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:13,328
and we'll assume perfect collimation,

36
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:17,024
so we'll assume that we have done
everything so that only x-rays

37
00:02:17,024 --> 00:02:22,065
that satisfy this geometric condition 
of being perpendicular to the detector

38
00:02:22,065 --> 00:02:23,858
are being detected.

39
00:02:24,188 --> 00:02:30,171
And for the sake of simplicity for now,
we will neglect the effect of attenuation.

40
00:02:30,171 --> 00:02:33,541
We'll assume that the x-rays 
that are in the subject

41
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,821
are passing through perfectly.

42
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:38,917
I'll establish here
the frame of reference.

43
00:02:38,917 --> 00:02:41,997
X is to the right and Y above.

44
00:02:42,437 --> 00:02:44,717
So here, X to the right and Y above.

45
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:48,804
And now we'll consider here
one point in this subject's head.

46
00:02:49,364 --> 00:02:52,313
This point is indicated by
the coordinates X, Y.

47
00:02:52,613 --> 00:02:58,335
We'll call the tissue activity here CT,
so CT typically stands for radioactivity,

48
00:02:58,335 --> 00:03:03,220
T for tissue, so that's tissue
radioactivity at this point, X and Y.

49
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,864
And now we will have here 
our single detector with the collimator,

50
00:03:08,064 --> 00:03:12,096
and we'll pretend here it only
selects photons that satisfy

51
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:15,016
this geometric condition
set forth by the collimator.

52
00:03:15,016 --> 00:03:20,559
So this is the signal that we now
detect in this situation.

53
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:24,448
We not only have the radioactivity of this
point that contributes to the signal,

54
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:27,572
we also have radioactivity that's here,
radioactivity that's here,

55
00:03:27,572 --> 00:03:32,762
radioactivity that's here,
so we have to sum over the entire range

56
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:35,112
where there is radioactivity,
or, in other words,

57
00:03:35,112 --> 00:03:38,681
we will sum over the entire range
of distance here because we don't know

58
00:03:38,681 --> 00:03:40,646
whether the x-ray comes from
here or from here.

59
00:03:40,646 --> 00:03:42,234
It is being detected.

60
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:46,158
We'll sum all the x-rays that are
satisfying this geometric condition,

61
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:50,763
and when we sum so,
then we get this integral here.

62
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:55,800
So we have the tissue radioactivity
along X for this given position along Y

63
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:00,680
summed from infinity --
minus infinity to infinity.

64
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,575
Do you recognize this function?

65
00:04:04,055 --> 00:04:06,831
Have we already dealt with
a function like this?

66
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:10,046
Well, you might have guessed it.

67
00:04:10,046 --> 00:04:12,512
This is a radon transform.

68
00:04:13,362 --> 00:04:16,706
So we can actually write our signal
as a radon transform.

69
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:18,673
That's actually the process 
of how we do it.

70
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:22,651
The good news is,
if we know the signal is described

71
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:27,762
by a radon transform,
we've already established last week

72
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:32,833
the process by which an image can be
reconstructed once we have it collected

73
00:04:32,833 --> 00:04:35,923
as radon transforms,
and that is back projection

74
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:38,638
so the reconstruction is done exactly--

75
00:04:38,638 --> 00:04:41,638
can be done exactly as
in computed tomography.

76
00:04:41,638 --> 00:04:46,474
So for us, there is no need to introduce
a new algorithm for image reconstruction

77
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:49,418
in emission-computed tomography.

78
00:04:50,358 --> 00:04:52,246
Now, let's look at collimation.

79
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:54,709
So, what we said
with collimation we're using--

80
00:04:56,269 --> 00:05:00,572
this is a way to establish
directionality of x-rays,

81
00:05:00,572 --> 00:05:03,058
and we have assumed here we have
perfect collimation.

82
00:05:03,058 --> 00:05:07,193
So only the x-rays along this line here
are being observed.

83
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:09,972
If we look at the real situation here,

84
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:13,922
we have the septa
and the separation of objects,

85
00:05:13,922 --> 00:05:16,448
so these two objects
are separated by this distance

86
00:05:16,448 --> 00:05:20,613
can still give a rise to detection
here at this point.

87
00:05:21,403 --> 00:05:26,904
If my object is further away,
then by these geometric requirements,

88
00:05:26,904 --> 00:05:29,434
these are the same septa here,
same length,

89
00:05:29,434 --> 00:05:33,081
the objects are further apart,
so the resolution goes down.

90
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,249
If we make the septa length longer,

91
00:05:36,249 --> 00:05:41,136
then the objects that can contribute here
to the radioactivity detected,

92
00:05:41,136 --> 00:05:45,262
they are closer together, 
so the resolution goes up.

93
00:05:47,062 --> 00:05:51,564
So this is a brief introduction
that the collimation

94
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:54,098
has an impact on the resolution.

95
00:05:54,928 --> 00:05:58,085
I want to briefly mention here one term
and that is this line here,

96
00:05:58,085 --> 00:06:00,318
we call that the line of incidence.

97
00:06:01,258 --> 00:06:04,503
So, collimation has an impact
on the resolution.

98
00:06:04,503 --> 00:06:06,467
Does it have another impact?

99
00:06:07,327 --> 00:06:08,778
Let's think about this.

100
00:06:09,018 --> 00:06:11,043
What do we do with collimation?

101
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:17,043
With collimation, we are establishing
directionality of the x-rays

102
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:21,271
by eliminating the x-rays that don't
satisfy the geometric condition.

103
00:06:21,571 --> 00:06:28,036
So this means that we are eliminating
x-rays so principally and fundamentally,

104
00:06:28,036 --> 00:06:31,013
we are reducing
the sensitivity of the scanner.

105
00:06:31,013 --> 00:06:35,038
It's a brute force way of establishing
directionality of the x-rays.

106
00:06:35,668 --> 00:06:39,520
So, while good collimation
improves the resolution,

107
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:43,489
it does at the same time,
and we can see that here,

108
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:46,225
it does at the same time
eliminate more x-rays

109
00:06:46,225 --> 00:06:50,943
and therefore reduce the sensitivity,
and we are back to being sandwiched

110
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:54,688
between the needs for sensitivity
and the needs for resolution,

111
00:06:55,018 --> 00:06:59,224
and those two are two principles
that go against each other.

112
00:07:00,464 --> 00:07:03,949
How does collimation affect resolution?

113
00:07:04,809 --> 00:07:07,083
I want to spend some minutes 
on discussing

114
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:13,025
how collimation can impact
the resolution of the scanner.

115
00:07:14,065 --> 00:07:17,003
Let's consider first 
what would be the conditions

116
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:19,960
for perfect collimation,
perfect resolution.

117
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,367
I'll draw here on
the X axis the detector,

118
00:07:24,807 --> 00:07:28,958
and then we have one septa here,
so that's a septa here.

119
00:07:30,288 --> 00:07:32,317
We'll draw a second one.

120
00:07:33,467 --> 00:07:35,107
and a third one,

121
00:07:36,627 --> 00:07:38,367
and a fourth one,

122
00:07:39,087 --> 00:07:40,617
and a fifth one--

123
00:07:41,067 --> 00:07:43,108
no, the fifth one will not come here.

124
00:07:43,568 --> 00:07:47,013
And we'll say that the septa have
a length of <i>a</i>,

125
00:07:47,013 --> 00:07:49,729
"a" being a certain
distance in centimeters.

126
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:54,286
They are separated by a distance <i>d</i>,
typically millimeters.

127
00:07:54,646 --> 00:07:58,761
They have thickness of <i>t</i>,
typically also millimeters.

128
00:07:59,561 --> 00:08:04,618
And we'll now introduce a point source
of radioactivity that is

129
00:08:04,618 --> 00:08:08,552
at a certain distance <i>b</i>
away from the end of the septa.

130
00:08:10,332 --> 00:08:13,749
What would give us perfect collimation?

131
00:08:14,579 --> 00:08:17,891
Number one, perfect collimation,
we would want to have

132
00:08:17,891 --> 00:08:22,050
x-rays that are perfectly perpendicular
to the detector here.

133
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,814
This we can achieve by making sure that
<i>d / a</i> goes to zero.

134
00:08:28,044 --> 00:08:30,611
So we have either very long septa,

135
00:08:34,221 --> 00:08:38,264
that's <i>a</i> going very long, 
or they are very closely spaced.

136
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:45,405
So, closely-spaced, very long septa
that will provide us with, essentially,

137
00:08:45,405 --> 00:08:50,097
only x-rays that are very perfectly
perpendicular to the scanner camera.

138
00:08:51,017 --> 00:08:56,272
The second condition is that the linear
attenuation coefficient of the collimator

139
00:08:56,272 --> 00:08:59,221
that times its thickness
goes towards infinity.

140
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:01,825
Where does that come from?

141
00:09:02,235 --> 00:09:04,452
Where does this condition come from?

142
00:09:05,322 --> 00:09:07,844
We have to consider that the collimator,

143
00:09:07,844 --> 00:09:10,942
we have so far assumed 
that the septa are perfect absorbers.

144
00:09:10,942 --> 00:09:13,096
They're only perfect absorbers 
of the x-ray

145
00:09:13,096 --> 00:09:17,426
if the distance through which 
the x-ray travels in the septa

146
00:09:17,426 --> 00:09:19,512
times the linear attenuation coefficient

147
00:09:19,512 --> 00:09:23,147
is such that very few x-rays 
pass through the septa.

148
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:27,036
So, this is the condition 
that they are perfect absorbers.

149
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:32,712
Can we achieve this in practice?

150
00:09:35,096 --> 00:09:36,978
No.
The answer is no.

151
00:09:37,188 --> 00:09:38,455
Why not?

152
00:09:38,845 --> 00:09:43,576
Well, theoretically, we could generate
a collimator that has <i>d</i> to <i>a</i>

153
00:09:43,576 --> 00:09:47,482
that goes towards zero,
so very long collimators

154
00:09:47,482 --> 00:09:49,872
that are very closely spaced.

155
00:09:49,872 --> 00:09:52,322
We would lose 
a lot of sensitivity doing that,

156
00:09:52,322 --> 00:09:56,348
but from a manufacturing standpoint,
we could imagine that we are building

157
00:09:56,348 --> 00:09:58,622
separations on the order of microns

158
00:09:58,622 --> 00:10:02,055
and collimator length
on the order of millimeters

159
00:10:02,055 --> 00:10:03,955
and then this goes towards zero.

160
00:10:04,365 --> 00:10:08,842
But even with the heaviest, 
high Z materials that we can think of,

161
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:11,442
and that we have available in nature,

162
00:10:11,442 --> 00:10:16,782
we will not be able to get the thickness
times the collimator go to infinity,

163
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:21,283
so we have imperfect
absorption of the x-rays.

164
00:10:21,643 --> 00:10:26,597
And <i>d</i> to <i>a</i>, letting that go to zero,
that would essentially mean

165
00:10:26,597 --> 00:10:30,322
we're detecting perfect collimated
x-rays but very few of them,

166
00:10:30,322 --> 00:10:32,397
so that's not very efficient

167
00:10:32,397 --> 00:10:36,211
for the image-generating process
in terms of sensitivity.

168
00:10:37,151 --> 00:10:42,101
Now I'll draw here an x-ray 
that's a properly-detected x-ray.

169
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:44,944
It's what we call the geometric event.

170
00:10:45,314 --> 00:10:47,155
This is the one that we've selected

171
00:10:47,155 --> 00:10:50,398
according to our geometry,
this is a good x-ray

172
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:54,090
that satisfies our geometric conditions,
that's a good detection.

173
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,222
Now we have another event.

174
00:10:56,222 --> 00:10:59,903
This is a x-ray that does not satisfy
the geometric condition

175
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:03,259
but is still being detected because
it's one of those x-rays

176
00:11:03,259 --> 00:11:05,769
that has not been
absorbed by the septa.

177
00:11:06,139 --> 00:11:10,291
It's passed the distance W
through the septa here

178
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:13,332
and the absorption has not been perfect.

179
00:11:13,332 --> 00:11:15,795
This is because this is not infinity,

180
00:11:15,795 --> 00:11:18,028
and so it's still being detected.

181
00:11:18,028 --> 00:11:20,476
That's a so-called penetrating event.

182
00:11:22,286 --> 00:11:25,154
Now, I'll give you a formula.

183
00:11:25,154 --> 00:11:28,347
I won't derive it here, 
and we'll consider here

184
00:11:28,347 --> 00:11:31,916
a penetration of the septa
that is less than 5%.

185
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:36,926
And this is given if the thickness is
equal to the thickness at 5%.

186
00:11:37,516 --> 00:11:41,495
Now, this is an emprical formula
I've taken from the literature here.

187
00:11:41,495 --> 00:11:46,842
It says that this thickness 
is roughly proportional

188
00:11:46,842 --> 00:11:48,892
to the distance between the septa

189
00:11:50,672 --> 00:11:53,865
divided by the linear attenuation
coefficient--that makes sense.

190
00:11:53,865 --> 00:11:57,475
This thickness becomes thinner the higher
the linear attenuation coefficient,

191
00:11:58,005 --> 00:12:03,392
and it is inversely proportional 
to the length of the septa here,

192
00:12:03,392 --> 00:12:06,934
the length <i>a</i> minus a correction term

193
00:12:06,934 --> 00:12:10,986
that involves the linear
attenuation coefficient.

194
00:12:12,756 --> 00:12:15,774
So, if the linear attenuation
coefficient is not perfect,

195
00:12:15,774 --> 00:12:19,153
this length here becomes longer--
shorter and this term

196
00:12:19,153 --> 00:12:23,854
in the bottom becomes shorter and so
this thickness has to be thicker

197
00:12:23,854 --> 00:12:27,685
to take into account
for imperfect penetration.

198
00:12:29,115 --> 00:12:31,613
We have another effect
and that is scatter.

199
00:12:31,613 --> 00:12:36,784
So the x-ray from our point source
can also interact in the septa

200
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:38,529
by Compton scattering

201
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:41,667
and be scattered into this event here.

202
00:12:41,907 --> 00:12:47,300
So we're getting a scattered event,
a scattering event at this point.

203
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,306
So, what does this mean?

204
00:12:49,306 --> 00:12:52,889
We are essentially trying to select 
only the geometric events,

205
00:12:53,229 --> 00:12:56,899
we are getting penetrating events,
and we're getting scattering events here.

206
00:12:56,899 --> 00:13:01,746
The scattering event is good but it could
also be that this is being here

207
00:13:01,746 --> 00:13:04,960
and scattered there or it goes here,
scattered here, et cetera.

208
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:09,024
So, what does this mean if
we look at our object?

209
00:13:09,024 --> 00:13:11,651
We have an object, a red object here,

210
00:13:11,651 --> 00:13:15,157
and it's relatively close 
to the collimator here,

211
00:13:15,157 --> 00:13:18,470
we're plotting the distance <i>d</i> here,
we're getting in our detector

212
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:24,402
a distribution of the measurement here
with a certain distribution,

213
00:13:24,402 --> 00:13:28,879
even though we're saying here 
the red object is a point-wise source.

214
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:32,884
If we're going further away 
then our point-wise source,

215
00:13:32,884 --> 00:13:35,465
still the same, it's just further away.

216
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:40,416
In green here, now we're getting
a wider distribution

217
00:13:40,416 --> 00:13:43,316
because the geometric requirement 
is relaxed.

218
00:13:43,316 --> 00:13:49,282
We're further away so we're increasing
the probability that some x-rays

219
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:53,280
will actually pass 
into the next bin here, on the side.

220
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,869
And finally, for the blue object,
we are even further away,

221
00:13:56,869 --> 00:14:01,922
so its distribution, its width 
as the way it's being detected, increases.

222
00:14:02,192 --> 00:14:05,492
That's another way of saying 
that the resolution decreases

223
00:14:05,492 --> 00:14:08,800
because the object is no longer
represented by a point object.

224
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,549
So, our source, that is in truth
and reality a point source,

225
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:16,458
at the distance indicated 
by the red object

226
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:20,248
is becoming a red circle.

227
00:14:20,668 --> 00:14:25,719
At the distance indicated 
by the green object it is increasing.

228
00:14:25,889 --> 00:14:30,821
And even further away,
the blue representation here

229
00:14:30,821 --> 00:14:35,416
gives us the furthest distance,
the object becomes blurrier and blurrier.

230
00:14:36,986 --> 00:14:41,997
So, we can put an emprical equation
to describe collimator resolution,

231
00:14:42,567 --> 00:14:44,537
and this is, again,
from the literature here,

232
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:45,742
I won't derive it.

233
00:14:45,742 --> 00:14:48,679
You have an exercise
where you can derive it

234
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:53,074
with slightly different
geometrical conditions.

235
00:14:53,344 --> 00:14:58,002
So, we can say here in a loose way,

236
00:14:58,582 --> 00:15:02,670
the objects are resolved if they are
separated by a distance, <i>R</i>.

237
00:15:03,090 --> 00:15:07,148
This distance <i>R</i> is given by the distance,

238
00:15:07,478 --> 00:15:10,984
is proportional to the distance 
of separation of the septa.

239
00:15:10,984 --> 00:15:13,364
That makes sense,
the further apart they are,

240
00:15:13,364 --> 00:15:16,170
the bigger is the angle
with which I can see the object,

241
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:21,879
times the total distance from the
detector to the object, <i>a</i> plus <i>b</i>,

242
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:25,765
although here the <i>a</i> is not
the real geometric <i>a</i>,

243
00:15:25,765 --> 00:15:29,103
it's an effective <i>a</i>,
and I'll come to that in a second,

244
00:15:29,103 --> 00:15:32,495
divided by the collimator length <i>a</i>.

245
00:15:32,935 --> 00:15:34,278
So, does this make sense?

246
00:15:34,278 --> 00:15:36,398
The further the collimators are apart,

247
00:15:36,398 --> 00:15:39,792
the bigger is <i>R</i> so the
poorer is the resolution.

248
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:43,092
The longer the septa are, the longer is <i>a</i>,

249
00:15:43,092 --> 00:15:49,073
the smaller is <i>R</i>,
so the better is the resolution,

250
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:55,099
and finally, the closer the object is 
to the septa, to the collimator,

251
00:15:55,509 --> 00:16:00,735
the smaller is <i>b</i>, the smaller is also <i>R</i>,
and the better is the resolution.

252
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:04,891
Now, what is this story about the <i>a_e</i>?

253
00:16:04,891 --> 00:16:08,649
Why do we not just put the <i>a</i>,
the length of the collimator?

254
00:16:09,659 --> 00:16:15,211
Well, <i>a_e</i> is the length of the collimator
corrected for the fact that the collimator,

255
00:16:15,211 --> 00:16:21,583
the septa, will not perfectly absorb
the x-rays so it is an effective length,

256
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,655
it's the geometric length,
the true physical length here,

257
00:16:24,655 --> 00:16:28,876
minus 2 over the linear
attenuation coefficient, <i>μ</i>.

258
00:16:28,876 --> 00:16:32,304
Basically means if the linear attenuation
coefficient, we pretend it goes

259
00:16:32,304 --> 00:16:37,217
towards infinity then this is indeed
the geometrical length of the septa,

260
00:16:37,217 --> 00:16:40,994
but in reality
it's a bit shorter than that.

261
00:16:41,714 --> 00:16:44,385
And this expression takes into account

262
00:16:44,385 --> 00:16:47,528
that the septal separation--

263
00:16:47,528 --> 00:16:52,048
septal absorption, I'm sorry,
septal absorption is not perfect.

264
00:16:52,328 --> 00:16:54,940
That's what is going into
the equation here.

265
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,321
So, what is the price of collimation?

266
00:16:58,321 --> 00:17:01,923
We have seen that good collimation,
we have expressions here,

267
00:17:01,923 --> 00:17:04,140
can give us good resolution.

268
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:09,459
What are the consequences 
of wanting to go to very good resolution?

269
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:12,906
I've already hinted at this a bit.

270
00:17:13,896 --> 00:17:15,989
The price is sensitivity.

271
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,052
Remember, collimation is the elimination
of unwanted x-rays

272
00:17:22,052 --> 00:17:24,978
that do not satisfy 
our geometric requirement

273
00:17:24,978 --> 00:17:28,821
of the x-ray being perpendicular
to the scanner, to the detector,

274
00:17:28,821 --> 00:17:32,473
and we're doing that by brute force,
eliminating the x-rays,

275
00:17:32,473 --> 00:17:35,429
by basically trying to prevent them
to come to the detector.

276
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,217
So we're taking out events,

277
00:17:37,217 --> 00:17:42,535
we're taking out radioactivity that passes
through the subject's body

278
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:44,027
from arriving at the detector.

279
00:17:44,027 --> 00:17:47,389
And so, we are, again,
paying the price

280
00:17:47,389 --> 00:17:52,919
of resolution with sensitivity,
coming back to these two effects,

281
00:17:52,919 --> 00:17:54,771
that in biomedical imaging,

282
00:17:54,771 --> 00:17:59,669
consistently counterbalance each other,
or counteract each other.
