1
00:00:04,601 --> 00:00:07,424
In the process of generating
a measurable signal

2
00:00:07,424 --> 00:00:11,565
that we can deal with in the camera
and/or the computer,

3
00:00:11,565 --> 00:00:13,945
we have to get
that visible light measured,

4
00:00:13,945 --> 00:00:15,968
and the question is, how do we convert

5
00:00:15,968 --> 00:00:18,800
the scintillation light
to an electrical signal?

6
00:00:20,267 --> 00:00:23,680
The process that's being used
is that of a photomultiplier tube.

7
00:00:25,131 --> 00:00:29,577
It's a bit different from what we use
in our CCD cameras, in our cell phones,

8
00:00:29,577 --> 00:00:33,294
so we have the scintillation crystal.
Here is the example, sodium iodide.

9
00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:37,630
That's the whole process.
We have the photomultiplier tube here

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,218
whose produced signal is being amplified.

11
00:00:41,218 --> 00:00:43,918
There's a Pulse Height Analyzer.
PHA stands for that,

12
00:00:43,918 --> 00:00:45,754
and it displays the signal.

13
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:50,730
Now I'll discuss what is inside
this photomultiplier tube,

14
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,633
what is the process that is going on.

15
00:00:53,633 --> 00:00:58,396
First, we have the photocathode,
we have the photomultiplier tube in vacuum

16
00:00:58,396 --> 00:01:02,302
and there are subsequent
anodes and cathodes.

17
00:01:02,903 --> 00:01:06,893
These pairs of anodes and cathodes
are called <i>dynodes,</i>

18
00:01:06,893 --> 00:01:09,831
and we have the final anode here,

19
00:01:09,831 --> 00:01:13,997
which is where the signal
is finally being detected.

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,459
One applies a voltage,
and in this typical example,

21
00:01:17,907 --> 00:01:24,641
this goes in increments of 150 Volts,
zero, 300, 450, 600, 750, 900, etc.

22
00:01:24,852 --> 00:01:29,652
until 1.2 Kilovolts is the voltage
that's being applied.

23
00:01:29,652 --> 00:01:33,884
At the end, a signal is being detected
that is sent to the Pulse Height Analyzer.

24
00:01:34,937 --> 00:01:38,265
Let's say we have a visible photon
that impacts the photocathode.

25
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:41,891
What it does in the photocathode,
we won't go into the details here,

26
00:01:41,891 --> 00:01:47,792
it liberates one or more electrons.
Let's say it liberates one electron.

27
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:52,548
This electron from the cathode
is accelerated towards the first anode

28
00:01:52,548 --> 00:01:58,273
where it liberates again more electrons.
We'll take an example of two,

29
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:01,857
so out of one electron, we have two.

30
00:02:01,857 --> 00:02:07,525
At the next point here
where it's accelerated towards

31
00:02:07,525 --> 00:02:12,792
we have -- again, we'll always assume
there's a factor of two.

32
00:02:13,262 --> 00:02:16,101
One electron produces two electrons,
so now we have four electrons

33
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:17,955
that are right here.

34
00:02:17,955 --> 00:02:24,792
We produce, again, with a dynode,
from four to eight, and then to 16,

35
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:31,421
and finally to 64 electrons that go
to the Pulse Height Analyzer.

36
00:02:31,794 --> 00:02:36,505
This process essentially allows us
from more or less a single photon here

37
00:02:36,505 --> 00:02:43,596
to produce a measurable signal
of many electrons

38
00:02:43,596 --> 00:02:47,555
that we can measure 
the change in signal,

39
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:51,647
the electrical signal of those electrons
when they arrive to the final anode

40
00:02:51,647 --> 00:02:53,863
of the photomultiplier tube.

41
00:02:54,537 --> 00:03:00,391
This is actually technology
from more than a half century ago.

42
00:03:00,976 --> 00:03:05,499
It is providing virtual noiseless
amplification of the signal.

43
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:09,581
What does
a photomultiplier tube look like?

44
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:11,076
Here it is.

45
00:03:11,076 --> 00:03:14,654
We have here the photocathode,
the subsequent dynodes,

46
00:03:14,654 --> 00:03:17,653
and here are the connectors
that connect to the instrument.

47
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:20,402
Let's think of what
the dimensions of this is

48
00:03:20,402 --> 00:03:22,885
and let's give you a scale here.
This is roughly a centimeter.

49
00:03:22,885 --> 00:03:26,555
These are fairly-- they're almost
like the size of a salt shaker.

50
00:03:27,773 --> 00:03:31,689
But wait, let's think:
we want to have images

51
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:35,500
with a spatial resolution,
typically on the order of millimeters,

52
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:39,747
but we have, in the end,
the units that detect our signal.

53
00:03:39,747 --> 00:03:43,328
They have dimensions on the order
of an inch, two centimeters,

54
00:03:43,328 --> 00:03:45,789
so salt shaker size.

55
00:03:45,789 --> 00:03:49,957
They are bulky, not adapted
to the resolution that we would like.

56
00:03:49,957 --> 00:03:51,945
To give you an idea
what this looks like here,

57
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:55,792
here we have such a detector board.
Here is the scintillation crystal.

58
00:03:56,186 --> 00:03:59,292
Here's the wave guide, and here
are all these photomultiplier tubes.

59
00:03:59,953 --> 00:04:02,766
Looks like a happy family
of salt shakers, doesn't it?

60
00:04:02,766 --> 00:04:03,928
Yes.

61
00:04:03,928 --> 00:04:07,486
But now, how do we get
high resolution images from this?

62
00:04:07,971 --> 00:04:10,900
How can we increase the spatial resolution

63
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:14,745
beyond the physical dimensions
of the photomultiplier tube?

64
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:18,070
That's the question: how do we improve

65
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:21,497
the spatial resolution
of the photomultiplier tube?

66
00:04:21,497 --> 00:04:23,786
Let's consider the situation here.

67
00:04:23,786 --> 00:04:28,528
We have a sodium iodide crystal
of 40 centimeters by 40 centimeters.

68
00:04:28,528 --> 00:04:32,098
It's perpendicular to the plane.
We have a light gate,

69
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:36,358
and then we have, here we've drawn
three photomultiplier tubes.

70
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:39,842
We'll say that the position
of these three photomultiplier tubes

71
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:42,204
is X1, X2, and X3.

72
00:04:42,204 --> 00:04:47,881
We have an X-ray that interacts
with the scintillation crystal,

73
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:50,395
so it produces scintillation light.

74
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:56,095
This scintillation light is detected
in this case by all three photomultipliers

75
00:04:56,095 --> 00:05:00,920
so they multiply the signal according
to the number of scintillation photons

76
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:03,731
that they detect, and therefore,

77
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:07,526
we obtain now from the single photon here,

78
00:05:07,713 --> 00:05:11,159
X-ray that has impacted here,
that has made the interaction here,

79
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:15,221
we're obtaining in these three
photomultipliers three signals.

80
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:19,271
We'll call this Intensity 1,
Intentsity 2, and Intensity 3.

81
00:05:20,524 --> 00:05:23,829
What we have said is: the number
of scintillation photons produced

82
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:27,478
is proportional to the energy of the X-ray

83
00:05:27,478 --> 00:05:29,573
so we have energy information.

84
00:05:29,573 --> 00:05:33,269
Now, how do we get
the position of the X-ray, figure it out?

85
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:37,798
Just from the intensity I1, I2 and I3,
if I measure it this way,

86
00:05:37,798 --> 00:05:40,877
I can say it's not on center on I2

87
00:05:40,877 --> 00:05:42,893
because this is higher than I1

88
00:05:42,893 --> 00:05:46,191
so somewhere the event
with these intensities

89
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:49,676
must have happened here
along where we have the dashed line.

90
00:05:50,265 --> 00:05:54,438
The precise calculation
is done with this equation here.

91
00:05:54,438 --> 00:05:59,594
We'll multiply the intensity of each
photomultiplier tube with their position

92
00:05:59,594 --> 00:06:03,319
and we'll divide it
by the total intensity measured.

93
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:07,391
That gives us the precise location
of the photomultiplier tube.

94
00:06:07,391 --> 00:06:09,339
This is just done for the dimension of X.

95
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:12,540
We don't need to worry
about how we do it in two dimensions.

96
00:06:14,238 --> 00:06:17,349
Once you flash back
to where this equation comes from,

97
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:20,118
I have no doubt
that it becomes fairly apparent.

98
00:06:20,795 --> 00:06:23,024
Does this equation look
in any way familiar?

99
00:06:24,088 --> 00:06:27,838
Well, think back,
if you've had a physics class,

100
00:06:27,838 --> 00:06:30,957
most likely you have had
the concept of center of mass

101
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:35,591
and the center of mass in mechanics,
in a mechanics physics lecture,

102
00:06:35,591 --> 00:06:37,890
had this expression here.

103
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:39,862
Mathematically, what we're looking at here

104
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:43,585
is a center of mass calculation
where we have replaced the mass

105
00:06:43,585 --> 00:06:46,884
by the intensity of the X-ray.

106
00:06:48,309 --> 00:06:52,832
So we have this equation that gives us
the position of the X-ray

107
00:06:52,832 --> 00:06:55,980
in the scintillation crystal,

108
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,626
and we can measure clearly
with different intensities

109
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:02,168
in the photomultiplier tubes' position
with a precision that's higher

110
00:07:02,168 --> 00:07:04,961
than the physical dimensions
of photomultiplier tubes.

111
00:07:05,707 --> 00:07:08,898
This is technology
that was developed in the 1960s.

112
00:07:08,898 --> 00:07:13,077
It's actually named
the "Anger Positional Network."

113
00:07:13,077 --> 00:07:14,764
It's named after gentleman Anger

114
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:17,342
and has nothing to do
with the term "anger" as such,

115
00:07:17,342 --> 00:07:19,875
so it's <i>nomen est omen</i> here.
