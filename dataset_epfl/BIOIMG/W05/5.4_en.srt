1
00:00:04,276 --> 00:00:08,404
So far we have been pretending
like we know how to measure x-rays,

2
00:00:08,404 --> 00:00:11,666
but I haven't really given you
a full picture

3
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,644
of how x-rays are being measured.

4
00:00:13,974 --> 00:00:16,534
We have dealt with the fact 
that we do collimation,

5
00:00:16,534 --> 00:00:21,615
but, how do we actually get an x-ray
into a measured signal?

6
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:25,475
And this is what I want
to discuss in this section.

7
00:00:26,335 --> 00:00:30,287
After collimation
we have the detection

8
00:00:30,287 --> 00:00:33,692
that consists of a scintillation crystal.

9
00:00:33,692 --> 00:00:37,805
So, a typical example here
is TI-doped SodiumIodide.

10
00:00:38,519 --> 00:00:41,259
We have the x-ray that hits this crystal,

11
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:44,904
interacts with the crystal.

12
00:00:46,076 --> 00:00:49,674
What happens then is, 
visible light is being produced.

13
00:00:51,015 --> 00:00:56,259
This light then impacts
on a photomultiplier tube

14
00:00:56,609 --> 00:01:01,137
which basically produces
a lot of electrons, then multiplied,

15
00:01:02,117 --> 00:01:06,335
and this, in the end,
produces an electrical signal.

16
00:01:08,394 --> 00:01:11,301
So this, schematically:
we have x-ray interacting

17
00:01:11,301 --> 00:01:13,469
with the crystal,
conversion to visible light,

18
00:01:13,469 --> 00:01:16,749
this visible light is amplified
into an electrical signal

19
00:01:16,749 --> 00:01:18,552
using a photomultiplier tube.

20
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:21,109
So, here's the complete process.

21
00:01:21,109 --> 00:01:24,294
Here we have the source,
we have the collimator crystal,

22
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:27,314
and scintillators,
and then we have the photomultiplier tubes

23
00:01:27,314 --> 00:01:29,361
that produce the signal.

24
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:33,112
One important feature
of this detection process

25
00:01:33,112 --> 00:01:41,222
is that the energy of the gamma photon
of the x-ray of 140 kV is one example.

26
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:45,037
This energy is proportional 
to the number of scintillation photons,

27
00:01:45,037 --> 00:01:46,969
those are these guys here in white.

28
00:01:47,789 --> 00:01:51,269
And this, in the end, is proportional
to the signal that we measure.

29
00:01:51,269 --> 00:01:53,421
So the intensity of the signal
that we measure

30
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:56,435
is a measure of the energy of the x-ray,

31
00:01:56,695 --> 00:02:01,505
and this is an important feature

32
00:02:01,505 --> 00:02:05,137
for the emission-computed
tomography techniques

33
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:07,464
that we're discussing this week
and next week.

34
00:02:08,754 --> 00:02:12,118
So, what is scintillation?
What happens in a scintillation crystal?

35
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:15,867
There are a sequence
of events to consider.

36
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:22,015
We'll have here the gamma ray,
the x-ray that hits our thin crystal.

37
00:02:22,985 --> 00:02:25,707
It produces a primary fast electron.

38
00:02:25,997 --> 00:02:28,424
This can be an electron
bumped out of an inner shell

39
00:02:28,424 --> 00:02:30,000
through the photoelectric effect.

40
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,633
Or it can be an outer shell electron
that's removed from the atom

41
00:02:33,633 --> 00:02:35,388
by Compton scattering.

42
00:02:35,411 --> 00:02:37,333
This electron in the crystal

43
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:41,313
will then produce a number 
of excited secondary electrons

44
00:02:42,173 --> 00:02:44,064
and actually electron-hole pairs

45
00:02:44,564 --> 00:02:47,188
which, in the end,
produces the scintillation photons.

46
00:02:48,158 --> 00:02:53,599
So it makes perfect sense if we have
a higher energy x-ray that comes in.

47
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,837
The kinetic energy 
of the liberated electron or electrons

48
00:02:59,497 --> 00:03:02,831
is higher, and therefore 
they are capable of producing

49
00:03:02,831 --> 00:03:05,531
more secondary electron-hole pairs,

50
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:08,751
and therefore they will produce 
more scintillation photons.

51
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:13,214
Hence the proportionality
of the visible light to the energy

52
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:14,941
of the incident x-ray.

53
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:19,442
So we'll consider here that the atom
is ionized by Compton interaction.

54
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:21,694
This produces an electron-hole pair.

55
00:03:22,604 --> 00:03:24,769
The hole ionizes the activator,

56
00:03:24,769 --> 00:03:27,258
the electron falls into the activator,

57
00:03:27,258 --> 00:03:30,600
and so when the activator is deactivated

58
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,706
and goes back to the ground state,

59
00:03:32,706 --> 00:03:35,842
it emits photons,
and it does that fairly fast.

60
00:03:35,842 --> 00:03:40,258
Here the example is on the order
of a tenth of a microsecond.

61
00:03:40,858 --> 00:03:43,305
If you look at it
from an objective standpoint

62
00:03:43,305 --> 00:03:47,022
we have a gap in the solid-state,
we have the activator ground state,

63
00:03:47,022 --> 00:03:49,176
and we have the activation band.

64
00:03:49,676 --> 00:03:52,558
This band comes actually from the doping,

65
00:03:52,558 --> 00:03:57,616
so this is GSO, with the doping
being here, indicated.

66
00:03:59,617 --> 00:04:03,444
I won't go into the details
and the physics of scintillation.

67
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:07,729
It's fairly complex, it's not a strict,
precise description of it.

68
00:04:08,399 --> 00:04:12,134
What suffices for us to know is 
that we need an impurity in the crystal,

69
00:04:12,514 --> 00:04:17,187
and that the number of scintillation
photons that are produced

70
00:04:17,187 --> 00:04:20,177
are proportional to the energy
of the incident x-ray.

71
00:04:21,603 --> 00:04:23,160
So now, what we have is--

72
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,478
we have excitation,
we have an energy transfer,

73
00:04:26,478 --> 00:04:27,618
and we have emission.

74
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,335
But we have also
quite some losses due to heat.

75
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:37,594
And so, we're interested in characterizing
scintillation materials

76
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:41,297
and that's one thing
is the efficiency of the scintillators.

77
00:04:41,297 --> 00:04:44,355
This is essentially the energy
of the scintillation light.

78
00:04:44,355 --> 00:04:48,331
So, energy of the visible photons
times the number of photons,

79
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:50,564
divided by the energy deposited,

80
00:04:50,564 --> 00:04:53,958
typically the energy
of the incident x-ray.

81
00:04:54,498 --> 00:04:59,022
And this is proportional
to the energy transfer efficiency

82
00:04:59,022 --> 00:05:02,100
from the excited ion
to the luminescence center.

83
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:06,278
So, how good are we in bringing
that energy to the impurity ?

84
00:05:06,818 --> 00:05:09,435
We have the quantum efficiency
of the luminescence center.

85
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:13,834
How efficiently does it produce the light,

86
00:05:13,834 --> 00:05:18,778
and how much energy is required
to generate an electron-hole pair?

87
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:22,429
Again, what makes sense is
if you need more energy

88
00:05:22,429 --> 00:05:26,078
created in a hole pair,
the efficiency is lower,

89
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:31,209
if we produce more photons
from a luminescence center,

90
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:35,047
the efficiency is better 
and if we can get the energy

91
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:38,744
transferred to the luminescence center
very efficiently,

92
00:05:38,744 --> 00:05:42,671
then the efficiency goes up, 
so these relationships make sense.

93
00:05:44,301 --> 00:05:46,185
So, instead of going through the theory,

94
00:05:46,185 --> 00:05:50,668
I wanted to share with you
some scintillation materials here,

95
00:05:50,668 --> 00:05:55,852
and the characteristics that typically
are used to characterize them.

96
00:05:55,852 --> 00:05:58,855
So, there's a whole bunch
of different materials here.

97
00:06:00,265 --> 00:06:03,093
What we notice
is they are fairly heavy materials,

98
00:06:03,093 --> 00:06:07,087
so the density ranges
between 3.7 for sodium iodide

99
00:06:07,087 --> 00:06:10,230
to around 8 for this compound here.

100
00:06:11,426 --> 00:06:14,791
The attenuation coefficient,
obviously we'd like it to be high,

101
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:20,389
so it's there somewhere
between .3 and 1 per centimeter--

102
00:06:20,389 --> 00:06:23,680
this is the attenuation coefficient
at 511 keV.

103
00:06:24,542 --> 00:06:26,046
Then we have the light yield.

104
00:06:26,046 --> 00:06:29,038
So, how many scintillation photons

105
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:33,234
are being produced per keV
of the incident x-ray?

106
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:37,940
Well we see here we're ranging
between 70 and 40 photons per keV.

107
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:42,334
So we have sodium iodide,
which is among the most efficient here

108
00:06:42,334 --> 00:06:43,934
in terms of energy yield.

109
00:06:43,934 --> 00:06:47,601
Produces 40 photons per keV.

110
00:06:48,258 --> 00:06:51,029
The wavelength
of the scintillation light here

111
00:06:51,029 --> 00:06:55,869
ranges between 360 and 600 nm.

112
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,961
Here is a time constant <i>τ</i>

113
00:06:58,961 --> 00:07:00,534
given in nanoseconds--

114
00:07:00,731 --> 00:07:03,550
this is the time it takes
for the luminescence center

115
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:05,832
to return back to the ground state

116
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:08,637
after it has emitted
a scintillation photon.

117
00:07:09,257 --> 00:07:11,668
This essentially gives you
an idea of how fast

118
00:07:12,368 --> 00:07:18,608
is the scintillation crystal reset
and ready to detect the next event.

119
00:07:19,028 --> 00:07:22,568
This is important because if we increase--

120
00:07:22,568 --> 00:07:25,152
if we have a lot of photons
that are being detected

121
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:30,788
we want a fairly fast crystal
so we can measure fairly fast.

122
00:07:31,478 --> 00:07:33,661
If the crystal is not been reset
back to its ground state,

123
00:07:33,662 --> 00:07:36,783
it cannot measure the next event,
and so we lose that event

124
00:07:36,783 --> 00:07:38,150
from the measurement.

125
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:40,697
Here are some ideas,
what are the effective <i>Z</i>

126
00:07:40,697 --> 00:07:43,712
of the materials, the refraction index,

127
00:07:43,712 --> 00:07:46,855
and the yield that we have.

128
00:07:47,523 --> 00:07:51,034
So what ideally would we have
for requirements for a scintillator?

129
00:07:51,034 --> 00:07:54,357
We want to have a high yield,
we want to have good linearity.

130
00:07:54,357 --> 00:07:56,591
Obviously, we'll discuss more why that is.

131
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:58,821
we want a small,
time constant like I said.

132
00:07:59,261 --> 00:08:01,217
We want to be able to measure every event

133
00:08:01,217 --> 00:08:03,512
that impacts on the crystal as far,

134
00:08:03,512 --> 00:08:05,801
so we don't want to miss out
on the second event.

135
00:08:05,801 --> 00:08:08,938
And if we have two events 
that come fairly short after each other,

136
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:13,176
of course it should be transparent
for scintillation light,

137
00:08:13,176 --> 00:08:15,510
there is no point in producing
scintillation light

138
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:17,987
that is mainly being absorbed
by the crystal.

139
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:23,718
Not to forget, it's a physical process
for producing a mechanical camera,

140
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:26,545
so it should have
good mechanical properties

141
00:08:26,545 --> 00:08:29,507
and a refraction index close to 1.5,

142
00:08:29,507 --> 00:08:32,333
so that the light is being reflected
through the crystal

143
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:38,322
and is being detected
by the photomultiplier tubes.

144
00:08:39,362 --> 00:08:41,168
So let's look here at the light yield,

145
00:08:42,504 --> 00:08:45,306
and the thing that we have
to bear in mind is

146
00:08:46,036 --> 00:08:48,720
if we have a photon that impacts
our scintillation crystal,

147
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,785
most of its energy is lost to the lactis
in the form of heat.

148
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:54,951
So I'll give you here just an example.

149
00:08:55,261 --> 00:08:57,213
Let's say, we have a technetium,

150
00:08:57,213 --> 00:08:59,508
metastable technetium 99 scan.

151
00:08:59,508 --> 00:09:01,667
So the photons are at 140 keV,

152
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:05,717
and we'll take the sodium iodide 
scintillated crystal--

153
00:09:05,717 --> 00:09:07,135
that's this material here.

154
00:09:07,725 --> 00:09:10,875
So we have a yield
of 40 photons per keV.

155
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:14,143
So we have one of those x-rays
impacting the crystal,

156
00:09:14,143 --> 00:09:21,146
we are producing 5600 photons
with a wavelength of about 400 nm.

157
00:09:21,426 --> 00:09:26,488
It's 415, but this is good enough
for our estimation here.

158
00:09:26,988 --> 00:09:31,282
So we have 5600 photons
with a wavelength of 400 nm.

159
00:09:32,002 --> 00:09:35,982
Now the energy at 400 nm--
we can calculate that from the equation

160
00:09:35,982 --> 00:09:38,457
we've introduced in week two.

161
00:09:38,457 --> 00:09:40,429
So that's given by <i>hc / λ</i>,

162
00:09:40,429 --> 00:09:42,877
so it's <i>1.2 / λ</i>.

163
00:09:43,127 --> 00:09:46,887
If we give <i>λ</i> in nanometers,
that's the energy in keV.

164
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:51,063
So that's 1.2 keV divided by 400 nm.

165
00:09:51,063 --> 00:09:55,969
And so, the visible light photons,
they have an energy

166
00:09:55,969 --> 00:09:57,731
of 3 electron volts.

167
00:09:59,421 --> 00:10:05,876
So, we are converting 140 keV
into 5600 photons

168
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:08,815
of 3 electron volts each.

169
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:13,363
So 3 electron volts times 5600,
we can say that's a little bit less

170
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:21,371
than 20,000 electron volts in total energy,
or it's less than 20 keV.

171
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,762
Or, in other words,
this is roughly less than a seventh,

172
00:10:24,762 --> 00:10:29,840
or in other words,
it's less than 120 electron volts per keV.

173
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:34,201
So we're having here a conversion
of the original energy

174
00:10:34,201 --> 00:10:39,226
into visible light, the energy we have
in a visible light of around 12%.
