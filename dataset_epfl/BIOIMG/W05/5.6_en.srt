1
00:00:04,368 --> 00:00:06,169
One process that we
need to be concerned with

2
00:00:06,169 --> 00:00:09,184
is the fact that photons can be scattered.

3
00:00:11,323 --> 00:00:15,915
Let's look here at a sphere
filled with water

4
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:20,847
and 99 metastable Technetium
and it's got holes in here.

5
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:25,675
These holes do not contain
radioactive material.

6
00:00:26,743 --> 00:00:28,680
We take along the yellow line a projection

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,635
so we cut through here,
we see intensity here,

8
00:00:30,635 --> 00:00:32,348
we see the hole that's here

9
00:00:32,348 --> 00:00:35,376
that's represented here
by very little intensity.

10
00:00:36,643 --> 00:00:40,088
This measurement was done
by only measuring photons

11
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:42,559
at 140 kiloelectron Volt.

12
00:00:43,129 --> 00:00:45,179
Here are the holes I want to point out.

13
00:00:46,097 --> 00:00:51,789
If the measurement is done selecting
only the photons at 104 kiloelectron Volt,

14
00:00:52,534 --> 00:00:55,300
we no longer see the holes.
They're gone.

15
00:00:55,668 --> 00:00:58,452
If we take at the same position
the projection through,

16
00:00:58,452 --> 00:01:00,841
we cut through the image here,

17
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,796
we no longer see the hole
that we've see here, so it's gone.

18
00:01:04,306 --> 00:01:09,563
This effect is similar to the scattering
that we've discussed for X-ray imaging,

19
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:11,474
for computer tomography imaging,

20
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:14,995
that increased scattering
increasingly masks the contrast.

21
00:01:15,823 --> 00:01:19,325
Now, most scattering
at the photon energies

22
00:01:19,325 --> 00:01:23,275
is done by Compton,
so we have a relationship

23
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:26,038
between the initial energy of the photon--

24
00:01:26,038 --> 00:01:29,769
that we know for Technetium,
it's 140 kiloelectron Volt--

25
00:01:29,769 --> 00:01:31,591
the measured energy of the photon,

26
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:33,760
which as we have discussed
with scintillation,

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,271
we can measure the photon energy
at the angle

28
00:01:36,271 --> 00:01:39,630
by which the photon has been scattered. 
That's <i>θ</i> here.

29
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:44,413
All that we need to do, in theory,
is to measure the photon energy

30
00:01:45,223 --> 00:01:50,080
of the detected photon, and with that
we can identify scattered photons.

31
00:01:51,766 --> 00:01:55,216
A word of caution here:
this process is not precise.

32
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:01,510
Let's look at the situation on the left.
We have 104 kiloelectron Volts

33
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:09,167
starting out with Technetium 140,
104 kiloelectron Volts, here's 102,

34
00:02:09,167 --> 00:02:12,724
that corresponds
to a scattering angle of 110º.

35
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:14,648
If we measure here, essentially,

36
00:02:14,648 --> 00:02:17,498
all the photons 
that were scattered by 110º.

37
00:02:17,948 --> 00:02:19,799
This is a fairly big angle,

38
00:02:19,989 --> 00:02:24,371
and therefore, we lose
the original contrast of the image.

39
00:02:26,154 --> 00:02:28,010
What is the signal that we detect?

40
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,463
We have, here on the horizontal axis,

41
00:02:31,463 --> 00:02:33,429
the energy of the photons
that we've measured

42
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:37,680
and the intensity number of counts
on the vertical axis, here.

43
00:02:38,616 --> 00:02:41,247
Now, we'll plot the primary peak,

44
00:02:41,247 --> 00:02:43,657
so <i>that</i>, we would essentially
want to measure.

45
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:47,243
That is the photons emitted,
at 140 kiloelectron Volt,

46
00:02:48,133 --> 00:02:50,905
and then we have
the scattered events here.

47
00:02:51,514 --> 00:02:53,971
Those are the orange dashed line.

48
00:02:53,971 --> 00:02:55,755
Those are the photons
that have been scattered.

49
00:02:56,085 --> 00:02:59,752
In reality, what we are measuring
from our object is a signal like this.

50
00:03:00,153 --> 00:03:03,784
We have the primary, the true counts,
the non-scattered photons,

51
00:03:03,784 --> 00:03:06,178
and then we have
all the scattered photons,

52
00:03:06,468 --> 00:03:09,852
that are obviously at lower energies
when they are being scattered.

53
00:03:10,447 --> 00:03:13,648
And so, our total signal
has this shape here

54
00:03:13,648 --> 00:03:18,234
that is not just this nice primary peak,
but has a distribution.

55
00:03:18,985 --> 00:03:21,786
This is the total intensity
we are detecting.

56
00:03:22,621 --> 00:03:27,451
The images that I've shown you
here bordered in red has been taken

57
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:29,321
from the photo peak window,

58
00:03:29,321 --> 00:03:34,652
centered on the primary signal
here at 140 kiloelectron Volts,

59
00:03:34,652 --> 00:03:38,122
and the blue image here,
at 104 kiloelectron Volts

60
00:03:38,122 --> 00:03:40,075
that was centered
on the scattered window,

61
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:43,084
basically taking the energy
in this range here,

62
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:46,891
generating the image for photons
that fall into this criterion,

63
00:03:46,891 --> 00:03:50,807
and the red image was generated
by photons that follow this criterion.

64
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,611
This allows us to eliminate
severely scattered photons.

65
00:03:58,586 --> 00:04:03,139
Not every scattered photon,
as we shall see shortly,

66
00:04:03,139 --> 00:04:07,331
because we do not have
a perfect energy discrimination.

67
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:11,319
It's very hard to distinguish
a 140 kiloelectron Volt photon

68
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:12,941
from 139 kiloelectron Volt

69
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:16,492
with the technologies
discussed in this course.

70
00:04:18,292 --> 00:04:23,834
To illustrate a bit more the processes
that happen in the body

71
00:04:23,834 --> 00:04:27,066
as well as in the scintillation crystal,

72
00:04:27,066 --> 00:04:30,813
I want to go over
the processes that contribute

73
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:33,673
to scintillation light spectrum.

74
00:04:34,743 --> 00:04:38,836
We're looking here at a thallium doped 
sodium iodide crystal

75
00:04:38,836 --> 00:04:42,189
and we're taking cesium-37
here as an example.

76
00:04:42,189 --> 00:04:45,330
This is at 662 kiloelectron Volt.

77
00:04:45,909 --> 00:04:47,675
This is what you get in data sheet.

78
00:04:47,675 --> 00:04:51,452
It's not a very clear
single scintillation peak.

79
00:04:51,792 --> 00:04:53,842
What happens in the crystal?

80
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:56,838
We are going to look at different events
in the crystal.

81
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:01,158
This will be plotted here and we will look
at how much intensity this produces.

82
00:05:01,888 --> 00:05:06,135
First here at 662 kiloelectron Volt,
we have the primary peak.

83
00:05:07,425 --> 00:05:12,717
This is due to photons that use
[inaudible] of their energy.

84
00:05:13,157 --> 00:05:15,882
So we have an X-ray that is plotted here.

85
00:05:15,882 --> 00:05:18,874
It comes into the tissue
and it loses all its energy

86
00:05:18,874 --> 00:05:25,020
to the scintillation centers
and they are converted to visible photons.

87
00:05:25,413 --> 00:05:29,802
This is, by far, the one that has
the most scintillation light intensity.

88
00:05:30,527 --> 00:05:32,755
You can also see
that this primary peak here

89
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:36,897
has a resolution
that is not a ∆ distribution

90
00:05:36,897 --> 00:05:42,110
so it has a certain distribution,
certain uncertainty in measurement,

91
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,200
and that gives us
an additional uncertainty

92
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:48,232
in determining the actual photon energy

93
00:05:48,232 --> 00:05:51,926
of the X-ray that came
into our scintillation crystal.

94
00:05:53,336 --> 00:05:58,020
The second event that's characteristic
here is the constant distribution.

95
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:02,438
This is from Compton events
and subsequent Compton events

96
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:06,840
where the secondary photon
has escaped the crystal.

97
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:10,806
Here, for the primary peak
it does not matter

98
00:06:10,806 --> 00:06:12,887
whether it's generated
by one photoelectric event

99
00:06:14,297 --> 00:06:19,272
that the electron already is generated
by multiple Compton events

100
00:06:19,272 --> 00:06:21,530
and a final photoelectric event.

101
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:27,381
Here we have Compton scattering
so we have reduced energy.

102
00:06:27,381 --> 00:06:30,769
We're not seeing
all of the energy of the X-ray

103
00:06:30,769 --> 00:06:37,456
and so, this is one case
where the secondary photon has escaped

104
00:06:37,456 --> 00:06:40,608
or here we have had
Compton scattering in the crystal

105
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:42,264
and we detect the energy here,

106
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:45,661
so this gives us this range of energies

107
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:48,706
that we are detecting
in the Compton distribution.

108
00:06:50,013 --> 00:06:53,052
Then we have this point here
which is called "the Compton edge."

109
00:06:53,052 --> 00:06:56,766
This corresponds to the maximum energy
of the recoil electron,

110
00:06:56,766 --> 00:07:00,494
so if the photon is backscattered by 180º

111
00:07:00,914 --> 00:07:05,890
it produces a recoil electron
and this is the maximum energy,

112
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,193
so here the X-ray comes in,

113
00:07:08,193 --> 00:07:11,441
it bounces the recoil electron
out of its banding

114
00:07:11,441 --> 00:07:16,009
and the electron then produces
secondary scintillation electrons.

115
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:22,074
Finally, we have also the event
of the backscattered photon

116
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:25,133
so the photon that's scattered by 180º

117
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:28,728
that we are detecting here,
and that's the backscatter peak here.

118
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:30,274
This characteristic.

119
00:07:31,376 --> 00:07:33,651
All in all, we have a fairly complex process

120
00:07:33,665 --> 00:07:35,877
of a number of events
in the scintillation crystal

121
00:07:35,877 --> 00:07:40,182
that produce a signal in the crystal.

122
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:45,544
So here is the event that produces
the backscatter photon

123
00:07:45,544 --> 00:07:48,417
that will then produce another event here

124
00:07:48,417 --> 00:07:51,416
and this energy produces
scintillation photons.

125
00:07:53,147 --> 00:07:57,333
With that, we have talked
about energy discrimination.

126
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,517
This will be important,
especially for next week.

127
00:07:59,517 --> 00:08:01,745
We've talked about attenuation correction,

128
00:08:02,125 --> 00:08:06,703
some processes that we
will be revisiting next week.

129
00:08:07,264 --> 00:08:12,732
This concludes the elements
of the emission computed tomography section

130
00:08:12,732 --> 00:08:14,062
of this course.

131
00:08:15,001 --> 00:08:18,486
I've briefly alluded to the official term
for emission computed tomography

132
00:08:18,486 --> 00:08:22,532
is actually <i>SPECT, single photon
emission computed tomography</i>

133
00:08:22,977 --> 00:08:28,166
and this is basically taking into account

134
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:31,526
that we're looking here
at nuclear decay processes,

135
00:08:31,526 --> 00:08:35,622
where the result of that
is the production of a single X-ray.

136
00:08:36,442 --> 00:08:40,610
This means what one does,
one measures single photon emitters.

137
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:43,246
They are injected into the subject.

138
00:08:44,196 --> 00:08:47,769
We use collimation
to ensure X-ray directionality,

139
00:08:48,129 --> 00:08:51,240
so the principle here is,
once we know the direction of the X-ray,

140
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,882
and once we have it recorded
along rotating projections,

141
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:59,345
then we can reconstruct
with backprojection.

142
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:03,861
For <i>SPECT</i>,
for emission computed tomography,

143
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,679
absorption is undesirable.

144
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,403
It's a parameter that we need to consider

145
00:09:08,403 --> 00:09:11,013
or try to eliminate.

146
00:09:12,491 --> 00:09:15,694
We have photon energies for the tracers,

147
00:09:15,694 --> 00:09:18,630
for the photon emitters.

148
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:22,489
They are comparable to the photon energies
used for CT scanning,

149
00:09:22,489 --> 00:09:28,497
so it is actually not surprising
that the industry standard for SPECT

150
00:09:28,497 --> 00:09:32,318
is becoming increasingly,
or has already become SPECT-CT.

151
00:09:32,318 --> 00:09:35,876
You can find the two techniques in one
as a detection process.

152
00:09:36,397 --> 00:09:38,869
It is essentially the same for both.

153
00:09:40,882 --> 00:09:45,388
This summarizes the essential features
of emission computed tomography.

154
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:48,068
As to the cost of the scanners,

155
00:09:48,068 --> 00:09:51,957
it is more expensive
than a computed CT scanner.

156
00:09:55,727 --> 00:09:58,565
This, of course,
varies by country and so on,

157
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:00,773
so I won't get into specific numbers here,

158
00:10:00,773 --> 00:10:06,700
but it is a more complex
and expensive technology than CT scanning.

159
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:12,053
Here is an example of a cardio scan.

160
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:17,466
This is in a mouse,
so we have the ribcage here.

161
00:10:17,642 --> 00:10:20,637
This is a CT scan so it gives us
the anatomical location

162
00:10:20,637 --> 00:10:23,239
and now we can see the heart beat here.

163
00:10:23,239 --> 00:10:27,857
How has one been able to obtain images
where one sees the heart beat?

164
00:10:28,323 --> 00:10:33,980
The scanning process, measuring
the emission computed tomography signal

165
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:38,926
takes minutes, so how can we
actually separate out the heartbeat--

166
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:41,563
this is a pseudo-resolution image
and what is being done--

167
00:10:41,563 --> 00:10:43,514
is that while the images
are being acquired

168
00:10:43,514 --> 00:10:45,021
each of the projections.

169
00:10:45,401 --> 00:10:49,381
At the same time, the ECG signal
of the heart is being recorded

170
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:53,749
and the slices are time-locked
to the heartbeat.

171
00:10:53,749 --> 00:10:57,442
Then they are reconstructed
for each of the cycles in the heartbeat

172
00:10:57,442 --> 00:11:00,485
at the same time, and this gives
a separate reconstruction

173
00:11:00,485 --> 00:11:03,222
and then we produce the images
and you loop them through

174
00:11:03,222 --> 00:11:05,335
and this gives you the impression

175
00:11:05,335 --> 00:11:07,653
of looking at a heart
beating in real time.

176
00:11:07,653 --> 00:11:09,416
It's not in real time,
but it gives you an idea

177
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:15,245
of how the uptake of the trace
varies with the beating heart.

178
00:11:16,932 --> 00:11:19,734
Here's an example from the human torso

179
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:22,264
so we have the filter
back projection image.

180
00:11:23,262 --> 00:11:26,287
We have the image
with attenuation correction,

181
00:11:26,287 --> 00:11:27,538
and we have the image

182
00:11:27,538 --> 00:11:29,687
with attenuation correction
and collimation.

183
00:11:29,902 --> 00:11:32,694
This is what we are getting here.

184
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:37,053
That image that's just a blob
is the SPECT scan.

185
00:11:37,053 --> 00:11:39,533
It's nice to know
that we have high uptake,

186
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:41,032
but where is it exactly?

187
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:44,111
So the SPEC CT, combination of CT,

188
00:11:44,371 --> 00:11:46,208
here is the CT image, with the SPECT

189
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:48,859
at the same time 
allows us to fuse the images

190
00:11:48,859 --> 00:11:52,793
and we can actually have an idea
of where this high uptake area

191
00:11:52,793 --> 00:11:54,502
is exactly in the body.

192
00:11:54,502 --> 00:11:59,503
This is far more useful than just
looking at the uptake itself.

193
00:12:00,593 --> 00:12:02,974
In this example we also have the effect

194
00:12:02,974 --> 00:12:06,645
of backprojection,
attenuation correction,

195
00:12:06,645 --> 00:12:12,280
and collimation, how this has
a severe impact on the resolution.

196
00:12:12,604 --> 00:12:16,122
We would be left to believe here

197
00:12:16,122 --> 00:12:20,429
that the lesion is essentially
everywhere here,

198
00:12:20,429 --> 00:12:24,694
but when we actually look with
attenuation correction and collimation,

199
00:12:24,858 --> 00:12:30,453
we get the focal point
of the uptake very nicely.

200
00:12:31,719 --> 00:12:34,586
Finally, the last example
that I want to discuss here

201
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:39,842
is this rotating image
of a pancreatic tumor in a mouse

202
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:43,839
so this is again a fused image
so we have SPECT and CT together.

203
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,332
The grayscale shows the skeleton.
That's been measured with CT.

204
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:52,513
The color scale shows the uptake
of the single photon emitter

205
00:12:52,513 --> 00:12:56,205
and here where we see
the blob at the bottom

206
00:12:56,205 --> 00:13:00,200
is the pancreatic tumor
that has been developed

207
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,049
in this animal model of cancer.

208
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:09,900
This concludes the emission computed
tomography lecture for this week.

209
00:13:10,996 --> 00:13:14,337
Next week we will go on
to its sister technique

210
00:13:14,337 --> 00:13:17,141
that's positron emission tomography.
