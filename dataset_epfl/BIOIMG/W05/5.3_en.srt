1
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:06,577
So we have dealt with Collimation,

2
00:00:06,577 --> 00:00:12,145
now I want to deal with the second effect
that we have to deal with,

3
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:15,137
and that is the attenuation
of the emitted x-rays.

4
00:00:17,246 --> 00:00:19,559
We have mentioned 
that this is one of the things

5
00:00:19,559 --> 00:00:21,273
that we'd ideally not have.

6
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:23,648
And now what we are going to look at,

7
00:00:23,648 --> 00:00:25,918
is an image of an object
that is homogeneous.

8
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:27,756
So we'll say it's a sphere.

9
00:00:27,756 --> 00:00:32,800
It's filled with a liquid that is doped
with, say, Technetium-99.

10
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:38,513
If it's just a liquid,
it has a constant radioactivity,

11
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:41,358
a constant specific activity
in the tissue,

12
00:00:41,898 --> 00:00:44,588
yet if we put that sphere
into the scanner,

13
00:00:44,588 --> 00:00:46,199
this is the image we get.

14
00:00:46,589 --> 00:00:49,070
We are getting bright intensity
at the surface,

15
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,974
and it is dark inside.

16
00:00:51,334 --> 00:00:57,988
This is not the tissue radioactivity,
Ct, that we'd like to measure.

17
00:00:57,988 --> 00:01:00,476
We know in this case, it is constant,
it is homogeneous,

18
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:01,640
yet what we're measuring,

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,105
is something that's bright on the outside
and dark on the inside.

20
00:01:05,885 --> 00:01:09,064
So what is the cause
for this intensity distortion?

21
00:01:10,314 --> 00:01:12,850
And I want to now explain this.

22
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,898
So, we'll take you have a situation,
an abstract situation;

23
00:01:16,898 --> 00:01:22,461
we have a bath filled with water
and some radioactive substance.

24
00:01:22,461 --> 00:01:25,031
We'll look at this point here
and we'll assume

25
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:29,650
that this water has a solution
of metastable Technetium-99,

26
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:34,594
but it's an aqueous solution
that's in this water bath.

27
00:01:35,384 --> 00:01:38,900
Now we have the linear 
attenuation coefficient of water

28
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,596
for 140 keV; that's the energy
of the photons

29
00:01:43,596 --> 00:01:48,484
of this tracer here
of metastable Technetium-99m.

30
00:01:48,484 --> 00:01:53,285
This linear attenuation coefficient
is 0.16 / cm.

31
00:01:53,625 --> 00:01:54,869
Here's our detector.

32
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:59,090
So we have here, a collimator,
and the camera behind it.

33
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,460
We'll come to the other elements
of the camera shortly.

34
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:08,828
We introduced here the distance,
and we'll say this object,

35
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,755
we're looking now at the point-wise,
at one point here,

36
00:02:12,755 --> 00:02:17,280
that is about 5 cm away from the camera.

37
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,385
So we know
the linear attenuation coefficient.

38
00:02:19,385 --> 00:02:20,814
We have a homogeneous object.

39
00:02:20,814 --> 00:02:22,868
And now we can calculate
the attenuation.

40
00:02:24,965 --> 00:02:29,402
So, this is something that,
a linear attenuation coefficient

41
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:35,044
expressed in per cm, 0.16 / cm,
is not very intuitive,

42
00:02:35,044 --> 00:02:37,900
and so it makes much more sense
to understand the numbers

43
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:43,199
that we're going to provide
by looking at the half value layer.

44
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:48,457
So, we have seen that the half value layer
is 0.7 divided by <i>μ</i>.

45
00:02:48,457 --> 00:02:55,086
And in this case, the half value layer is,
4.5 cm for Technetium in water.

46
00:02:55,086 --> 00:02:57,200
So if we're 5 cm away,

47
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,020
we should essentially have
a reduction of the signal,

48
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,895
that is, a bit more
than half of the signal.

49
00:03:04,735 --> 00:03:07,429
And so we'll talk here
about the attenuation <i>T</i>,

50
00:03:10,247 --> 00:03:12,094
as a function of the distance <i>D</i>.

51
00:03:12,094 --> 00:03:16,768
So the distance is how far our object
is away from the scanner.

52
00:03:17,388 --> 00:03:19,869
Now we've seen from x-rays,

53
00:03:19,869 --> 00:03:22,982
that the intensity as a function
of distance <i>D</i>,

54
00:03:22,982 --> 00:03:26,227
is given by the original intensity
incidence x-ray;

55
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:30,225
that's the number of x-rays
that are emitted in this direction,

56
00:03:30,225 --> 00:03:34,350
<i>N_0</i> times <i>e</i> to the <i>− μ d</i>.

57
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:38,839
So with this we can calculate
the attenuation,

58
00:03:38,839 --> 00:03:43,666
and the attenuation is given
by the number of photons detected

59
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:46,799
divided by the number
of photons emitted in that direction,

60
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,024
and that's <i>e</i> to the <i>− μ d.</i>

61
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:53,609
So in this case, the attenuation is 0.46.

62
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:59,572
So we are detecting only 46%
of the photons that are emitted

63
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,841
in that direction, at a distance of 5 cm.

64
00:04:03,758 --> 00:04:07,965
Now, one consequence is,
if this is clearly distance dependent,

65
00:04:07,965 --> 00:04:11,674
the deeper we are,
the more attenuation we have.

66
00:04:12,044 --> 00:04:14,766
And so, the attenuation,
the reduction of the x-rays

67
00:04:14,766 --> 00:04:19,383
that are being detected,
depends on the object dimensions,

68
00:04:19,633 --> 00:04:21,813
as well as on where the source is.

69
00:04:21,813 --> 00:04:26,693
So the distance here, <i>D</i>,
where our source is, this part here,

70
00:04:26,693 --> 00:04:32,079
is source location and it depends
on the size of our object.

71
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:36,458
And here are three examples
of an object with 10 cm length,

72
00:04:36,458 --> 00:04:39,251
20 cm length and 30 cm length,

73
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:43,256
and we'll look at the activity detected
at the center of the object--

74
00:04:43,256 --> 00:04:46,770
it is decreasing
with increasing object size.

75
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,680
Because the further away we are
at the center from the surface,

76
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:55,792
the longer the distance the x-ray
has to travel through the object,

77
00:04:55,792 --> 00:05:00,506
and so, the less likely we are
to detect an x-ray.

78
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:05,451
So, let's take the next situation here,
we're 10 cm away, in this case.

79
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,421
So the distance is 10 cm.

80
00:05:09,421 --> 00:05:13,746
So we roughly have two times
the distance,

81
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:15,918
so it's the square of the attenuation,

82
00:05:15,918 --> 00:05:18,923
so 0.46², that is roughly 0.21.

83
00:05:18,923 --> 00:05:26,443
So we have 21% of the photons that will
survive a travel of 10 cm through water.

84
00:05:26,443 --> 00:05:31,771
And the last example here is,
15 cm of a distance,

85
00:05:31,771 --> 00:05:36,479
and here, we're only ending up
detecting only 10% of the photons.

86
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:43,219
So here we have 5 cm, 10 cm,

87
00:05:43,219 --> 00:05:47,669
and here we have 15 cm
from the center to the outside.

88
00:05:48,019 --> 00:05:50,913
And this is exactly
what has happened in here.

89
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:54,041
The substance
at the surface of the sphere

90
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:57,180
does not travel much
to get to the detector,

91
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,475
does not travel much
through our water solution,

92
00:06:00,475 --> 00:06:02,749
so it is hardly attenuated.

93
00:06:02,749 --> 00:06:05,817
Whereas, for the image generation,
the substance

94
00:06:05,817 --> 00:06:08,746
that's at the center of the sphere,
will always have to travel

95
00:06:08,746 --> 00:06:10,216
the radius of the sphere.

96
00:06:10,216 --> 00:06:13,071
So it's consistently being
much more attenuated,

97
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:16,920
so that's why you are seeing an image
that instead of being homogeneous,

98
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:21,176
is bright on the edge
and dark on the inside.

99
00:06:22,726 --> 00:06:25,603
To conclude, if we're looking
at the point source,

100
00:06:25,603 --> 00:06:27,835
we have taken a homogeneous path,

101
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:32,309
we have looked at three
different distances to the camera

102
00:06:32,309 --> 00:06:34,813
we're seeing quite clearly
that the attenuation

103
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:41,867
depends on the location of the source
in the tissue, relative to the camera.

104
00:06:42,836 --> 00:06:44,426
There's a second consequence here.

105
00:06:44,426 --> 00:06:50,376
and that this the attenuation depends
on the specific radioactive substance

106
00:06:50,376 --> 00:06:52,796
that we're using
on the specific gamma emitter.

107
00:06:53,176 --> 00:06:55,740
We have here there situation of--

108
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,176
in a solid line
of metastable Technetium-99,

109
00:06:59,176 --> 00:07:02,814
we have the dashed line is Iodine-131,

110
00:07:02,814 --> 00:07:06,240
and the small dashed line here
is Thallium-201.

111
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,440
And you can see
that there is a difference

112
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:12,214
in attenuation based
on the type of isotope.

113
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:14,968
So that is because the linear
attenuation coefficient

114
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:21,289
is not uniform for any substance
with photon energy,

115
00:07:21,289 --> 00:07:24,050
it depends on the photon energy,
and so this absorption

116
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,658
depends on the tracer that we're using.

117
00:07:26,658 --> 00:07:29,837
Of course, here would be
the activity we detect

118
00:07:29,837 --> 00:07:31,963
if we have no absorption.

119
00:07:32,837 --> 00:07:35,021
So to conclude, we have two effects:

120
00:07:35,711 --> 00:07:39,345
location of the source,
dimensions of the object,

121
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:42,491
and type of gamma emitter
that we're using.

122
00:07:42,821 --> 00:07:47,877
They all contribute in a different way
to the attenuation of the x-ray

123
00:07:47,877 --> 00:07:50,567
in emission computed tomography.

124
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:54,832
So what are the basic steps in correcting

125
00:07:54,832 --> 00:07:58,645
for this distortion in image intensity
due to attenuation?

126
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:01,441
What are the basic steps
in attenuation correction,

127
00:08:01,441 --> 00:08:02,854
that we can do?

128
00:08:03,584 --> 00:08:05,128
So here we have the image again.

129
00:08:05,128 --> 00:08:09,959
This is what we've measured
in our sphere of a homogeneous signal.

130
00:08:10,799 --> 00:08:13,949
We will calculate
the linear attenuation coefficient,

131
00:08:13,949 --> 00:08:15,681
as a function of position.

132
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:19,341
And we can use that
for attenuation correction.

133
00:08:19,851 --> 00:08:21,328
So we use this.

134
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:22,772
This is the measured,

135
00:08:23,289 --> 00:08:27,676
with the measured linear attenuation
coefficient or calculated,

136
00:08:27,676 --> 00:08:30,508
and we can correct the image intensity.

137
00:08:30,508 --> 00:08:34,616
So that is he basic principle
of how attenuation correction

138
00:08:34,616 --> 00:08:36,937
can in theory be corrected.

139
00:08:37,677 --> 00:08:42,199
So how is this procedure--
will this procedure proceed?

140
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:45,572
We'll take an estimated object geometry

141
00:08:45,572 --> 00:08:47,602
and an estimated
linear attenuation coefficient,

142
00:08:47,602 --> 00:08:49,805
or even a measured
linear attenuation coefficient.

143
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:53,088
We'll calculate the transmission loss.

144
00:08:53,088 --> 00:08:56,935
This transmission loss is a function
of the projection.

145
00:08:57,225 --> 00:08:58,501
Where are we, how are we,

146
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:00,774
which projection orientation
are we measuring?

147
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:05,685
And so it's a function of the distribution
of the linear attenuation coefficient

148
00:09:05,685 --> 00:09:07,384
over the object.

149
00:09:07,384 --> 00:09:10,555
But it's also a function of [inaudible]
specific projection

150
00:09:10,555 --> 00:09:12,374
that we are registering.

151
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:15,470
So here's our object.

152
00:09:16,903 --> 00:09:22,834
We have the measured intensity here
and then we can calculate

153
00:09:22,834 --> 00:09:25,683
from the transmission loss--

154
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:27,524
here's the transmission
loss characterized.

155
00:09:27,524 --> 00:09:30,631
We have the true activity;
this gives us the transmission loss,

156
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:35,401
and we can calculate the parameter A
as a function of position X and Y.

157
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:37,669
That's one over the transmission loss.

158
00:09:37,669 --> 00:09:39,720
That's the attenuation correction.

159
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:42,203
This would look
in this example here, like this,

160
00:09:42,203 --> 00:09:45,029
so we have to do
more correction at the center

161
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:47,072
and less correction at the edges.

162
00:09:47,642 --> 00:09:52,972
And then we will calculate the corrected
activity profile or image,

163
00:09:53,632 --> 00:09:55,862
by multiplying these two terms:

164
00:09:55,862 --> 00:10:00,608
the measured activity, C,
with the correction parameter, A.

165
00:10:00,608 --> 00:10:03,332
And then we get the image here.

166
00:10:03,862 --> 00:10:08,610
So this corresponds to this image
or this corresponds

167
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,742
to the correction calculated
based off this.

168
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:13,264
This here corresponds
to a cut through this,

169
00:10:13,264 --> 00:10:14,940
which is corrected.

170
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:19,265
So that is in principle
the attenuation correction procedure

171
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:22,330
that one could apply.

172
00:10:24,524 --> 00:10:27,565
However, there is a problem,
a practical problem here.

173
00:10:27,965 --> 00:10:32,166
And that is, we need to know
the distribution

174
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:38,693
of the linear attenuation coefficient
in our subject, in our organs.

175
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,995
We also need to know where is the source
of the x-ray that we detect.

176
00:10:45,265 --> 00:10:48,509
And both of the things
are not perfectly achievable.

177
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:52,405
While we can, with for example,
computer tomography,

178
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:54,950
get an estimate of the correction matrix,

179
00:10:54,950 --> 00:10:57,444
this is the correction matrix
of the thorax,

180
00:10:57,444 --> 00:11:02,378
we see the heart here, we have the lungs,
here's the spine, rib-cage on the outside.

181
00:11:02,378 --> 00:11:04,178
We could in theory calculate that.

182
00:11:04,178 --> 00:11:09,365
But if we do detect the x-ray
in our scanner,

183
00:11:10,405 --> 00:11:12,126
we don't know where it came from.

184
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:13,690
We detect an x-ray here.

185
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,321
Did it come from here,
did it come from here,

186
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:16,695
or did it come from here?

187
00:11:17,359 --> 00:11:23,200
On average, we don't know,
so it's difficult to apply in practice

188
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,724
this attenuation correction.

189
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:31,023
And actually, believe it or not,
because of that

190
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:34,525
the attenuation correction
is rarely applied,

191
00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:39,742
and only in special circumstances,
because of these complexities.

192
00:11:40,727 --> 00:11:43,810
Now I want to discuss one way
of how one can simplify

193
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,259
the attenuation correction.

194
00:11:45,259 --> 00:11:47,307
It is not a generally
applicable procedure,

195
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:50,081
but it's a nice introduction
to attenuation correction

196
00:11:50,081 --> 00:11:53,385
that we'll discuss for the next
imaging modality, next week,

197
00:11:53,385 --> 00:11:56,778
and that is positron emission tomography.

198
00:11:57,058 --> 00:12:01,405
The problem that we have is that,
the correction is spatially dependent,

199
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:02,919
it's source dependent.

200
00:12:03,509 --> 00:12:04,993
So now we'll consider a point source.

201
00:12:04,993 --> 00:12:09,351
Here at this particular point
in the subject's head,

202
00:12:09,881 --> 00:12:13,767
it's tissue radioactivity, <i>C_T</i>,
acquisition <i>x y</i>,

203
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,754
that's the tissue radioactivity.

204
00:12:16,464 --> 00:12:20,996
And now, what we will do,
the solution to simplify this is,

205
00:12:20,996 --> 00:12:25,485
to consider the geometric mean
of signals that are acquired

206
00:12:25,485 --> 00:12:27,621
at 180 degrees opposite.

207
00:12:28,251 --> 00:12:30,830
So I'll first introduce
the position of our object.

208
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,909
We have the distance from our object
to the left end of the subject is <i>x_1</i>,

209
00:12:35,909 --> 00:12:42,192
and distance from our object
to the right end of the patient is <i>x_2</i>.

210
00:12:43,075 --> 00:12:50,017
So the dimensions along <i>x</i> of our object
at this point is given by <i>x_1 + x_2</i>,

211
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:51,687
and we'll call that big <i>D</i>.

212
00:12:52,297 --> 00:12:54,249
So now we have the signal <i>S_1</i>.

213
00:12:54,249 --> 00:12:56,261
That's detected on the left side.

214
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:58,490
We can see the perfect collimation here,

215
00:12:58,490 --> 00:13:01,974
and we have a signal <i>S_2</i>,
collected from the right side,

216
00:13:01,974 --> 00:13:03,531
from this point source.

217
00:13:03,971 --> 00:13:06,816
So I'll give you the explicit
expression here:

218
00:13:06,816 --> 00:13:12,176
we have the tissue radioactivity <i>x_1, y</i>,
so that's position <i>x_1</i>,

219
00:13:12,448 --> 00:13:16,997
seen from detector 1 
times <i>e</i> to the <i>−μ x_1</i>.

220
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:18,720
And we'll assume here for simplicity,

221
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,113
a homogeneous linear
attenuation coefficient.

222
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,973
On the right side, we have
signal <i>S_2</i>, is given

223
00:13:25,973 --> 00:13:30,841
by the same tissue radioactivity
times <i>e</i> to the <i>− μ x_2</i>.

224
00:13:31,191 --> 00:13:34,430
These are really not equal signs,
they're proportionality

225
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:36,806
but we'll just for simplicity,

226
00:13:36,806 --> 00:13:39,972
we'll forget all
the proportionality [inaudible].

227
00:13:39,972 --> 00:13:41,850
So now what can we do?

228
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:46,635
We'll take signal <i>S_1</i> and <i>S_2</i>,
multiply them by each other

229
00:13:46,635 --> 00:13:48,224
and take the square root.

230
00:13:48,224 --> 00:13:49,671
That's what we've done here.

231
00:13:49,671 --> 00:13:51,379
We'll take the expression on the left.

232
00:13:51,379 --> 00:13:52,504
This one.

233
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:54,578
Multiply it by the expression
on the right.

234
00:13:54,578 --> 00:13:55,905
This one.

235
00:13:55,905 --> 00:13:58,843
And take the square root of that.

236
00:13:58,843 --> 00:14:02,477
The <i>C_T</i>, the tissue radioactivity,
we can take that out of the root,

237
00:14:02,477 --> 00:14:04,774
because that's in there squared.

238
00:14:04,774 --> 00:14:09,035
And then we have <i>e</i> to the <i>− μ x_1 + x_2</i>.

239
00:14:09,035 --> 00:14:13,516
And that is equal
to the square root of <i>e</i> to the <i>−μ D</i>.

240
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:19,439
A reminder here, <i>D</i> is equal to <i>x_1 + x_2</i>.

241
00:14:19,439 --> 00:14:23,413
So, if we now simplify that,
then we have the geometric mean,

242
00:14:23,413 --> 00:14:25,713
that is the multiplication of <i>S_1</i> with <i>S_2</i>,

243
00:14:25,713 --> 00:14:27,033
taking the square root

244
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:32,499
that's equal to the tissue radioactivity
times <i>e</i> to the <i>− μ D</i> divided by 2.

245
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:38,238
So this now means that
if we correct our signal this way,

246
00:14:38,238 --> 00:14:41,069
from our subject, we no longer
have to be concerned

247
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:45,860
from where exactly the x-ray
in the body is emitted,

248
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,823
but we only have to consider
with the total travel distance

249
00:14:48,823 --> 00:14:53,444
of the x-ray, through the object alone,
the left and the right,

250
00:14:53,444 --> 00:14:56,819
the total travel distance
passing through the object.

251
00:14:57,929 --> 00:15:01,624
This correction works in this example,
for a point-wide source.

252
00:15:01,624 --> 00:15:08,074
It works in reality, if the uptake
is limited to a specific region,

253
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:09,484
so focal uptake.

254
00:15:09,484 --> 00:15:12,778
Not if the uptake is diffused
over the entire body;

255
00:15:12,778 --> 00:15:17,598
it will not work as nicely
as if we're looking at as focal uptake.

256
00:15:17,598 --> 00:15:21,362
And one example here
are the heart scans,

257
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:24,939
with imaging computed tomography,

258
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:27,154
here the heart has an intense uptake

259
00:15:27,394 --> 00:15:29,561
and the rest of the body
surrounding the heart

260
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:32,341
does not have such an intense uptake.

261
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:38,404
To summarize, we mentioned at 180 degrees
opposite the signal <i>S_1</i>, <i>S_2</i>,

262
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:44,829
simultaneously multiply them
and basically take the geometric mean.

263
00:15:45,590 --> 00:15:48,538
And then that means
that the attenuation correction

264
00:15:48,538 --> 00:15:51,839
that we have to apply to the signal,
for each Radon,

265
00:15:52,541 --> 00:15:57,061
for each projection, depends only on
the dimension of the object,

266
00:15:57,061 --> 00:15:59,228
along the measured Radon transfer.

267
00:15:59,228 --> 00:16:04,636
That is, if you will, the thickness
of the object, <i>D</i>, in this case.

268
00:16:05,876 --> 00:16:07,892
So this is a simplification,

269
00:16:07,892 --> 00:16:10,480
but clearly if we do a scan
in this direction,

270
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,046
we have the scanner here
or if we have the scanner here,

271
00:16:13,046 --> 00:16:16,813
the distance that the x-rays
in total pass through,

272
00:16:16,813 --> 00:16:19,875
is different for this dimension
and this dimension.

273
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,915
At least for most of us.
