1
00:00:04,222 --> 00:00:07,220
So, in this week's lecture 
we are going to discuss

2
00:00:07,220 --> 00:00:11,431
the next x-ray-based imaging technique,

3
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:15,201
and that is emission computed tomography,
or, as it is more known,

4
00:00:15,201 --> 00:00:17,490
single photon emission 
computed tomography.

5
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,140
But we'll stick here with the term
emission computed tomography

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,970
because it is emphasizing the difference
to computed tomography,

7
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:30,691
which we dealt with last week, that is,
we're looking at emission of x-rays.

8
00:00:30,691 --> 00:00:33,370
But first, I want to give you 
some examples

9
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,430
of what this technique does.

10
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,160
This is an example of two images.

11
00:00:39,080 --> 00:00:41,712
Can you guess what the image 
on the left side is?

12
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:43,681
Look at it a little bit.

13
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:47,351
Well, we notice

14
00:00:49,211 --> 00:00:51,181
here, on the outer rim,

15
00:00:51,181 --> 00:00:55,657
the image is bright, 
so there's a lot of contrast.

16
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:59,250
Here it is bright,
and on the inside

17
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:01,050
there is a grayish kind of color.

18
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,754
This is a cut through the head,

19
00:01:02,754 --> 00:01:05,172
and what we're seeing here 
on the outside,

20
00:01:05,172 --> 00:01:09,796
this is the skull bone.

21
00:01:09,796 --> 00:01:12,715
So we're looking 
at a computed tomography scan

22
00:01:12,715 --> 00:01:13,967
on the left side.

23
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:17,037
On the right side,
we're looking at a thallium PET scan.

24
00:01:17,977 --> 00:01:20,061
So, this is a patient with AIDS.

25
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:24,280
The patient received a contrast agent.

26
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,646
This is what we discussed two weeks ago
in Segment Three.

27
00:01:29,646 --> 00:01:34,494
And so, the contrast enhancement here,

28
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:38,135
this could be a toxoplasmosis abscess.

29
00:01:38,135 --> 00:01:40,208
It could be an abscess or a lymphoma.

30
00:01:40,208 --> 00:01:41,965
It's a breakage of the blood-brain barrier

31
00:01:41,965 --> 00:01:44,341
because the contrast agent
is here in this lesion.

32
00:01:44,691 --> 00:01:47,984
What the thallium scan here tell us,
there's thallium uptake,

33
00:01:47,984 --> 00:01:52,652
that this is, indeed, 
a intense uptake of the tracer

34
00:01:52,652 --> 00:01:56,102
and therefore, of the substance, 
and therefore, it is a lymphoma.

35
00:01:56,102 --> 00:02:00,311
So here, the use of two imaging techniques
allows one to distinguish

36
00:02:00,311 --> 00:02:04,751
what the lesion exactly is
that is present in the brain.

37
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:10,842
Here is HMPAO SPECT scan
now using the <i>metastable technetium</i>,

38
00:02:10,842 --> 00:02:13,842
a ubiquitously-available isotope.

39
00:02:14,212 --> 00:02:16,152
This is from the control, 
a <i>sagittal cut</i>,

40
00:02:16,152 --> 00:02:19,971
so it's cutting 
through the head like this.

41
00:02:20,211 --> 00:02:22,402
We have here, at the front, the nose.

42
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:24,697
This would be the nose here,
and the <i>occipital lobe</i>,

43
00:02:24,697 --> 00:02:26,912
the visual processing 
that we have back here,

44
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:28,552
is on the back of the head.

45
00:02:28,892 --> 00:02:31,740
Here's the same scan,
now applied to a patient with Alzheimer's.

46
00:02:31,740 --> 00:02:35,833
You can see clearly,
a different uptake of the substance,

47
00:02:35,833 --> 00:02:37,255
a different map.

48
00:02:37,255 --> 00:02:41,523
This is showing the degeneration
of the brain tissue.

49
00:02:41,523 --> 00:02:42,944
And we have now,

50
00:02:44,414 --> 00:02:47,044
the scan from a dementia 
with Lewy bodies,

51
00:02:47,044 --> 00:02:50,414
also showing, clearly, a reduced uptake.

52
00:02:50,414 --> 00:02:54,793
The color code here goes 
from yellow to blue, high to low,

53
00:02:54,793 --> 00:02:57,434
and this is dementia with Lewy bodies.

54
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:00,465
Do you know 
what <i>dementia with Lewy bodies</i> [is]?

55
00:03:00,465 --> 00:03:04,695
Well, one example is Parkinson's disease,
is a Lewy body disease.

56
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:07,489
Here we have an example of a patient

57
00:03:07,489 --> 00:03:12,496
with uncontrolled epileptic seizures,

58
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:17,686
and this is a measurement 
of metabolism in the brain.

59
00:03:17,686 --> 00:03:19,876
On the bottom, we have the normal subject,

60
00:03:19,876 --> 00:03:22,886
so we have high uptake here
in the visual cortex,

61
00:03:22,886 --> 00:03:24,344
in the back of the head.

62
00:03:24,344 --> 00:03:27,884
And here on the sides, 
on the surface in the cortex,

63
00:03:27,884 --> 00:03:29,404
we have high uptake.

64
00:03:29,404 --> 00:03:35,114
So, we have in the area here,
we have low blood flow in this area

65
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:39,595
which indicates reduced functionality
of the brain tissue.

66
00:03:40,715 --> 00:03:44,444
Now, we'll come to examples 
of human heart scan

67
00:03:44,444 --> 00:03:47,346
and then some rodent examples.

68
00:03:47,346 --> 00:03:48,794
First, I want to show you this video.

69
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:51,274
This is showing you a typical SPECT scan.

70
00:03:51,274 --> 00:03:56,375
Now, it's for the heart, 
so what would be the stress test.

71
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:59,015
So, the subject is doing 
a hand grip exercise

72
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:01,174
as you can see on the screen.

73
00:04:01,174 --> 00:04:05,203
This hand grip exercise 
is meant to stimulate the heart rate

74
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:07,226
so the heart is working harder,

75
00:04:08,386 --> 00:04:10,514
and he does that for a certain while.

76
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,228
And then, as you can see,

77
00:04:12,228 --> 00:04:17,677
the nurse administers the tracer,

78
00:04:17,677 --> 00:04:22,205
that's the substance that's used 
for emission computed tomography.

79
00:04:22,205 --> 00:04:23,835
This is done with a syringe
as you can see,

80
00:04:23,835 --> 00:04:25,718
fairly heavy, so it's shielded,

81
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:28,987
that the nurse is not exposed 
to radioactivity.

82
00:04:28,987 --> 00:04:32,228
It is being infused into the patient.

83
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:35,717
Then, one waits a certain amount of time.

84
00:04:35,717 --> 00:04:38,318
He's being put onto the scanner--

85
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:41,108
there you can see the patient bed--

86
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:44,638
and as he is on the scanner,
you will see that

87
00:04:46,394 --> 00:04:50,141
there's a big box here that starts to move.

88
00:04:50,141 --> 00:04:54,021
That is actually the instrument
that is now being moved, physically,

89
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:56,091
around the subject.

90
00:04:58,921 --> 00:05:01,400
As we keep scanning on the screen,

91
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,356
the different projections 
are being recorded,

92
00:05:05,356 --> 00:05:07,444
and as they are being recorded,

93
00:05:07,444 --> 00:05:12,443
later, the computer puts them together, 
reconstructs them into an image,

94
00:05:12,443 --> 00:05:17,964
and we can see the typical 
characteristic v-shape of heart uptake

95
00:05:17,964 --> 00:05:20,834
of the substance in the heart.

96
00:05:21,164 --> 00:05:24,002
In the end, when the scan is done,
the subject comes out.

97
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:26,934
We can see the head moving still.

98
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:35,959
So, this are some examples
of such a heart scan.

99
00:05:35,959 --> 00:05:38,419
We have under stress and under rest,

100
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:40,978
and it is pseudo-colored with colors

101
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:44,038
so if it's orange and yellow, 
it means good perfusion.

102
00:05:44,038 --> 00:05:49,678
If it is blue or purple cold colors, 
then it means poor perfusion in this scan,

103
00:05:49,678 --> 00:05:54,610
so we can very easily 
depict heart function.

104
00:05:54,950 --> 00:05:57,218
Now, what we're looking at here 
are <i>slice images</i>,

105
00:05:57,218 --> 00:05:59,429
so these are slices cut through the heart,

106
00:05:59,429 --> 00:06:02,189
and this is illustrated here 
in this 3D model.

107
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:04,243
We have the heart here,
this is a model of the heart,

108
00:06:04,243 --> 00:06:05,928
and this illustrates how,

109
00:06:05,928 --> 00:06:08,739
with the imaging technique
one virtually cuts slices.

110
00:06:08,739 --> 00:06:10,698
One does not, of course,
physically cut the slices,

111
00:06:10,698 --> 00:06:13,962
but with the imaging technique
there are slices selected,

112
00:06:13,962 --> 00:06:17,624
and that's what 
we're looking at here on the left.

113
00:06:18,914 --> 00:06:20,289
Now, if we go to rodents,

114
00:06:20,289 --> 00:06:25,881
we have here a scan 
from a human on the left side,

115
00:06:25,881 --> 00:06:27,231
it's a bone scan.

116
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:29,111
We see the entire skeleton.

117
00:06:29,111 --> 00:06:32,335
And here, on the side to the subject,

118
00:06:32,335 --> 00:06:34,025
you see the size of a rodent.

119
00:06:34,025 --> 00:06:35,609
It's a mouse or a rat.

120
00:06:35,999 --> 00:06:38,520
So, you can see how much smaller that is,

121
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:44,109
and then we see the scan 
of the rodent here, in greater detail.

122
00:06:44,109 --> 00:06:47,930
So clearly, as a scanner that's adapted 
to the size of a human subject

123
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:52,010
is not adapted to the size 
of a rodent or vice versa,

124
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:55,920
so the technology has to adapt 
to the subject in question.

125
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:59,250
And so, if you look 
at a SPECT scanner for rodents,

126
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:03,142
here we're looking at it, 
it's behind this box here,

127
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:04,731
and we have here the opening.

128
00:07:04,731 --> 00:07:07,115
This is the patient bed 
now pulled up vertically.

129
00:07:07,115 --> 00:07:10,073
This would move the subject 
into the scanner here.

130
00:07:10,073 --> 00:07:13,221
So clearly, this is a scanner 
where a human doesn't fit in there,

131
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:17,500
but the rodents, it is adapted 
to the size of the rodents, made smaller.

132
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,497
Everything scales down.

133
00:07:19,937 --> 00:07:21,710
Here's a SPECT scan

134
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,640
of a, again, 99 technetium,
metastable technetium MDP scan.

135
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:29,758
It's a small mouse.

136
00:07:29,758 --> 00:07:33,835
We can see, there's the head,
the tail would be here,

137
00:07:33,835 --> 00:07:37,338
and we have uptake in the legs,
we have the glands here.

138
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:42,578
And, of course, also, the kidneys,
which have uptake.

139
00:07:43,688 --> 00:07:46,441
Here's a scan 
of a sickle cell anemia mouse,

140
00:07:46,441 --> 00:07:49,092
using macroaggregated albumin,

141
00:07:49,092 --> 00:07:54,195
again, with 99 technetium,
metastable technetium.

142
00:07:54,195 --> 00:07:58,436
And we look here, we're having here 
the bright uptake in color.

143
00:07:58,436 --> 00:08:01,536
Now, what we also see 
is this grayscale image here,

144
00:08:01,536 --> 00:08:03,005
and this grayscale image

145
00:08:03,005 --> 00:08:07,166
is a CT scan that's done in parallel 
to the examination.

146
00:08:07,166 --> 00:08:08,715
We see the bone is bright.

147
00:08:08,715 --> 00:08:10,466
We see here the rib cage.

148
00:08:10,786 --> 00:08:12,822
We see here other bone structures.

149
00:08:12,822 --> 00:08:15,766
Here's a cut through the torso,
again, the rib cage,

150
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:18,797
and the spine back here.

151
00:08:19,057 --> 00:08:22,979
This serves to give 
a background anatomical image

152
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,708
which serves to identify exactly 
the areas of high uptake,

153
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:30,048
here in this case 
of metastable technetium.

154
00:08:31,238 --> 00:08:33,914
And here is a cut,

155
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:36,703
an image of a bone scan.

156
00:08:36,703 --> 00:08:40,842
This is the same technique 
that we have here.

157
00:08:40,842 --> 00:08:41,835
This is rotating.

158
00:08:41,835 --> 00:08:46,033
We can see, again, the glands here,

159
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:49,227
taking up a lot of the tracer.

160
00:08:49,227 --> 00:08:55,084
And otherwise, it's a good tracer 
of the skeleton of this animal.

161
00:08:57,192 --> 00:09:00,505
So, what is <i>emission computed tomography</i>?

162
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:05,233
We have, until now,
for computed tomography and x-ray imaging,

163
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:07,205
we have dealt with the fact

164
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:09,717
that they measure the attenuation 
of the incident x-ray.

165
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:12,858
So we have an x-ray 
that moves towards the object.

166
00:09:12,858 --> 00:09:15,473
At the end, once it's passed 
through the object,

167
00:09:15,473 --> 00:09:17,159
we measure its intensity.

168
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:21,388
The absorption of the x-ray is linked 
to the linear attenuation coefficient,

169
00:09:21,388 --> 00:09:26,349
and so we are using the attenuation 
of the incident x-ray

170
00:09:26,349 --> 00:09:29,459
that is giving us the contrast,

171
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:35,468
i.e., that's the distribution 
of the linear attenuation coefficient.

172
00:09:36,188 --> 00:09:39,447
Now, emission computed tomography,
or emission tomography,

173
00:09:39,447 --> 00:09:44,433
what we're actually looking here at 
as the name implies is, emission.

174
00:09:44,433 --> 00:09:47,448
So, x-rays are being emitted 
by a substance,

175
00:09:48,398 --> 00:09:49,629
an exogenous substance,

176
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:53,742
that is a foreign substance
that is being administered,

177
00:09:53,742 --> 00:09:55,692
and those x-rays 
that this substance emits

178
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:57,121
are being measured.

179
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:00,006
Hence, the name emission tomography.

180
00:10:01,956 --> 00:10:03,654
So what is a <i>tracer</i>?

181
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:07,703
And I'll go here with a much more 
general definition

182
00:10:07,703 --> 00:10:10,073
because the properties of a tracer--

183
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:13,442
how it is being analyzed,
as we will discuss in a few weeks--

184
00:10:13,442 --> 00:10:15,742
are fairly ubiquitous.

185
00:10:15,742 --> 00:10:19,042
And I'll use it in a very loose term here.

186
00:10:19,372 --> 00:10:24,191
It is, essentially, 
and this is what is common here,

187
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:28,169
it's a substance that is exogenous,
so it's not naturally occurring.

188
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,850
It is administered into the body,

189
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,210
typically infused into the blood vessels,

190
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:36,120
sometimes, also, ingested.

191
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:40,500
And now I'll go 
with a more generalized definition.

192
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:45,691
It is: The tracer can be something 
that alters the image contrast,

193
00:10:45,691 --> 00:10:47,417
as in CT and MRI.

194
00:10:47,417 --> 00:10:49,468
There, we call it contrast agent,

195
00:10:49,468 --> 00:10:52,745
but it essentially has 
the same properties as a tracer.

196
00:10:52,745 --> 00:10:57,182
And, the second definition is,
that it has a unique signal.

197
00:10:57,182 --> 00:10:59,676
And for this week's 
and next week's purpose,

198
00:10:59,676 --> 00:11:01,298
it is a <i>gamma emitter</i>,

199
00:11:02,678 --> 00:11:05,634
and it traces, therefore, the processes.

200
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:09,246
It's administered in trace amounts,
therefore, it's called a tracer.

201
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:11,948
And since it is gamma emitting,

202
00:11:11,948 --> 00:11:15,245
that explains the term "emission" 
in emission computed tomography.

203
00:11:15,245 --> 00:11:17,185
It's emission of x-rays

204
00:11:17,185 --> 00:11:19,748
and not transmission 
or absorption of x-rays

205
00:11:19,748 --> 00:11:21,206
that we're looking at.

206
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:24,799
So, let's look at this situation here.

207
00:11:24,799 --> 00:11:26,496
We inject the radioactive tracer

208
00:11:26,496 --> 00:11:29,759
and watch this subject
as the tracer's being taken up.

209
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:33,280
The color changes, 
with red implying that this tracer,

210
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:36,729
that the gamma emitter 
has now been distributed,

211
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,281
and now we have emission 
of x-rays from the body.

212
00:11:40,281 --> 00:11:42,476
So, the body is now radioactive.

213
00:11:42,476 --> 00:11:44,666
The x-rays are leaving the body,

214
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,877
and that is the signal 
that we would like to measure.

215
00:11:49,017 --> 00:11:53,219
So, let's look at some typical tracers 
for emission tomography.

216
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:56,158
This is giving you an idea 
of what their half-life is,

217
00:11:56,158 --> 00:11:58,747
and also the photon energies.

218
00:11:58,747 --> 00:12:02,426
We have, as mentioned, 
the metastable technetium 99.

219
00:12:02,426 --> 00:12:04,508
It has a half-life of six hours,

220
00:12:04,508 --> 00:12:08,748
and the photon energy 
is 140 Kiloelectron-volts.

221
00:12:08,748 --> 00:12:12,667
We have thallium 
that we have also, I mentioned,

222
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:15,151
has a half-life of 73 hours.

223
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,767
The photon energy 
is 70 Kiloelectron-volts.

224
00:12:17,767 --> 00:12:21,477
We have iodine, 13 hours half-life,
160 Kiloelectron-volts.

225
00:12:21,477 --> 00:12:23,148
And Xenon.

226
00:12:23,148 --> 00:12:27,197
Which, Xenon interestingly has 
only five minutes of half-life here.

227
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:29,097
That's a twelfth of an hour.

228
00:12:29,097 --> 00:12:33,138
So, the photon energies, 
as we can see in these examples,

229
00:12:33,138 --> 00:12:35,371
they range between 
70 and 160 Kiloelectron-volts,

230
00:12:35,371 --> 00:12:38,559
so they are pretty much in the range 
of what we've discussed

231
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:41,058
for computed tomography.

232
00:12:42,148 --> 00:12:44,468
Now, imagine you have 
this tracer in your body.

233
00:12:44,468 --> 00:12:48,279
It is the result 
of a nuclear decay process.

234
00:12:48,719 --> 00:12:49,748
So, this process:

235
00:12:49,748 --> 00:12:52,014
A) does not know 
anything about chemistry,

236
00:12:52,014 --> 00:12:55,050
and B) doesn't know 
anything about directionality.

237
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:57,014
So the x-rays that we see here,

238
00:12:57,014 --> 00:13:00,049
they are leaving 
in all sorts of directions,

239
00:13:00,049 --> 00:13:03,698
and that is not very useful 
for generating an image,

240
00:13:03,698 --> 00:13:06,709
and we'll have to deal with that fact.

241
00:13:06,709 --> 00:13:07,729
So, essentially,

242
00:13:07,729 --> 00:13:10,199
we have this emission computed tomography
to get to an image.

243
00:13:10,199 --> 00:13:12,719
We have two major issues to deal with.

244
00:13:12,719 --> 00:13:14,190
Number one is:

245
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:17,750
How do we determine 
the <i>directionality</i> of the x-rays?

246
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,239
There is no good method

247
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:22,990
that allows us to directly measure 
a photon that comes in,

248
00:13:22,990 --> 00:13:25,460
and its direction of flight.

249
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,035
So, this is something 
that we have to deal with.

250
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:32,640
And the second element 
that is important here is,

251
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:35,241
<i>absorption</i> for 
emission computed tomography

252
00:13:35,241 --> 00:13:36,727
is undesirable.

253
00:13:36,727 --> 00:13:39,003
It's not the measured variable.

254
00:13:39,003 --> 00:13:41,175
It is a nuisance effect.

255
00:13:41,175 --> 00:13:45,690
Ideally, we would want to have a situation
where we have no absorption

256
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,652
and, as you can guess, 
this does not exist,

257
00:13:47,652 --> 00:13:52,240
so it is a unwanted 
and not-measured effect,

258
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,910
but it does impact our images 
as we generate them.

259
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:00,070
So now, the question is:

260
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:03,621
What are the basic elements
that are needed for gamma-emitter imaging?

261
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:05,180
Here, on the bottom left,

262
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:07,749
you can see an image 
of such a <i>gamma camera</i>.

263
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:10,290
We have the patient bed here on the left.

264
00:14:11,410 --> 00:14:14,470
This is the scanner here, the holder.

265
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,701
And here is the box 
that contains the scanner,

266
00:14:16,701 --> 00:14:19,629
which is what we've seen 
on that video at the very beginning,

267
00:14:19,629 --> 00:14:21,230
that moves around the patient.

268
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:24,196
This is what contains the gamma camera.

269
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:26,667
So what is inside this box?

270
00:14:26,667 --> 00:14:28,003
So, I'll try to illustrate this.

271
00:14:28,003 --> 00:14:31,419
Here's the subject below the box,
here's the subject.

272
00:14:31,419 --> 00:14:34,151
And this, what we're looking at,
is inside the box.

273
00:14:34,151 --> 00:14:39,880
And there are a number of elements 
that we can observe in the gamma camera.

274
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,992
We have number one, we have a <i>collimator</i>.

275
00:14:42,992 --> 00:14:45,203
The collimator is made out of septa,

276
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:48,631
and we will discuss shortly
some consequences of this

277
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:50,249
and why this is needed.

278
00:14:50,929 --> 00:14:55,646
Then we have a <i>scintillating crystal</i>,
that's the next element here.

279
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:58,658
And, we have the <i>photomultipliers</i>.

280
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:01,560
These are the three major elements 
I want to discuss

281
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,800
that have the major impact 
on scanner performance

282
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,011
that we are discussing in this course.

283
00:15:09,671 --> 00:15:11,730
We have here schematically:

284
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:16,526
collimator, scintillation crystal, 
and photomultipliers.

285
00:15:16,526 --> 00:15:19,335
These are the three elements 
we're going to discuss.

286
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:20,930
We have, of course, additional elements.

287
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,835
That is, the light guide, 
I will not discuss this,

288
00:15:23,835 --> 00:15:27,450
and position logic electronics
that are used.

289
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:32,693
We'll briefly touch on that as well,
but only briefly.

290
00:15:33,003 --> 00:15:35,160
So here is the same camera.

291
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:38,068
Here's the gamma camera, top and bottom,

292
00:15:38,068 --> 00:15:41,988
and we have the collimator board here 
that's pulled out,

293
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:45,338
so they have different 
collimator boards for this scanner.

294
00:15:45,338 --> 00:15:48,418
This is a thyroid scanner 
for the thyroid gland.

295
00:15:48,418 --> 00:15:50,558
And, finally, we have here,

296
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:53,151
a scanner for the whole-body scintigraphy,

297
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:56,168
so here's the patient bed, 
here's the gamma camera,

298
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:59,908
and this is moved up and down 
to do whole-body scintigraphy.
