1
00:00:03,774 --> 00:00:07,479
We are now, in this section
of the course, Section 2.,

2
00:00:07,479 --> 00:00:11,229
we are going to talk about
magnetic resonance imaging.

3
00:00:11,899 --> 00:00:16,068
As you will see,
this is distinctly different

4
00:00:16,082 --> 00:00:20,292
from the X-ray-based techniques
that we have discussed in Part 1.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:24,550
I want to start now the introducing
of the magnetic resonance

6
00:00:26,291 --> 00:00:27,211
of MRI.

7
00:00:27,209 --> 00:00:29,459
I want to start out with, first,
some examples;

8
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:32,531
we'll start with examples
of animal models.

9
00:00:33,483 --> 00:00:38,513
This is a high resolution scan,
MRI scan, of a mouse.

10
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:41,774
It's a whole body scan
at very high resolution,

11
00:00:41,774 --> 00:00:45,184
and you can certainly appreciate
all the fine details

12
00:00:45,184 --> 00:00:50,174
that are observable here,
particularly, in the soft tissue.

13
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:55,081
Here is another example
of blood vessels,

14
00:00:55,081 --> 00:00:59,230
so here contrast agents were used
to depict the blood vessels here

15
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:01,779
in this mouse embryo.

16
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:06,062
Another example here
is brain function.

17
00:01:06,062 --> 00:01:09,745
We are looking at the vascular
blood vessels inside the brain.

18
00:01:09,745 --> 00:01:13,175
Here's the brain,
here's another brain scan,

19
00:01:13,175 --> 00:01:17,689
looking at the activity
in the brain tissue

20
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:20,754
that can also be done with MRI.

21
00:01:20,754 --> 00:01:23,247
Here's an example of a longitudinal study

22
00:01:23,247 --> 00:01:25,829
looking at a stroke in the brain;

23
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:27,225
the development of the stroke.

24
00:01:27,209 --> 00:01:29,154
One can see some bright areas here

25
00:01:29,154 --> 00:01:32,301
and this is the Nissl staining that shows
the death of neurons--

26
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:36,055
that's done after the MRI scanning
has been done.

27
00:01:37,385 --> 00:01:41,517
And finally, another example
that one can look at

28
00:01:41,517 --> 00:01:43,396
is chemical compounds,
here phosphorus--

29
00:01:43,396 --> 00:01:48,418
phosphocreatine ATP,
using spectroscopy of, in this case,

30
00:01:48,406 --> 00:01:50,056
the rat brain.

31
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,626
One thing-- and this is really
an important message here--

32
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:56,994
is one thing that distinguishes MRI

33
00:01:56,994 --> 00:02:02,295
from the previous modalities,
the other modalities,

34
00:02:02,295 --> 00:02:05,663
is it has one instrument, one magnet.

35
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,459
But basically, it has
many modalities built into it.

36
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:15,276
Or, as we would call it,
many different contrast mechanisms.

37
00:02:15,276 --> 00:02:19,520
Let me illustrate this
with the human brain.

38
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,348
We have here contrast mechanisms
exploited that's called <i>FLAIR</i>.

39
00:02:24,348 --> 00:02:30,035
It highlights certain processes,
typically from multiple sclerosis.

40
00:02:30,035 --> 00:02:31,727
Then we have here,

41
00:02:31,709 --> 00:02:35,168
a contrast agent application;

42
00:02:35,182 --> 00:02:39,982
we have here an image
of cerebral blood volume changes;

43
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,042
we have a mechanism called MTR that's
Magnetization Transfer Ratio imaging;

44
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:51,282
We have diffusion,
apparent diffusion coefficient or ADC

45
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:52,937
that's being measured here--

46
00:02:52,937 --> 00:02:54,940
this is all the same patient--

47
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,201
and finally, we have
a biochemical measurement

48
00:02:57,201 --> 00:03:01,085
of choline to N-acetyl aspartate
concentrations--

49
00:03:01,077 --> 00:03:04,017
a map, showing changes here
always in the same lesion.

50
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:07,947
So, we take this, this has been
all done in the same patient,

51
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:09,925
pretty much in the same session,

52
00:03:09,925 --> 00:03:15,561
and we're obtaining six different views
of the same process that's going on--

53
00:03:15,561 --> 00:03:20,615
and this is exploiting the same principle,
the same detection principle,

54
00:03:20,615 --> 00:03:22,786
the same instrumentation principle--

55
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:28,639
but there are many ways in which one
can manipulate the contrast with MRI,

56
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,210
and therefore,

57
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:34,956
what is important to be stressed here,
what I like to stress here,

58
00:03:35,375 --> 00:03:38,251
is we have one magnet and many modalities.

59
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:42,474
We don't have an MRI as such.

60
00:03:42,474 --> 00:03:44,342
An MRI as such does not exist,

61
00:03:44,342 --> 00:03:48,691
and MRI comes always with a definition
of what particular contrast mechanism

62
00:03:48,691 --> 00:03:51,028
is being imaged.

63
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:55,375
Let me go on with the example
of one magnet, many contrasts

64
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:57,382
in the rat brain.

65
00:03:57,382 --> 00:03:59,066
We have phase imaging--

66
00:03:59,066 --> 00:04:02,585
so we have a normal image here,
this traditional image--

67
00:04:02,585 --> 00:04:05,226
and if one looks at the magnetic field
within the tissue,

68
00:04:05,226 --> 00:04:09,121
one can see the different cortical layers
inside the brain.

69
00:04:09,966 --> 00:04:12,757
We can look at the distribution
of glutamate,

70
00:04:12,757 --> 00:04:17,793
which is the major excitatory
neurotransmitter in the brain.

71
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:22,459
One can look at transport of calcium,

72
00:04:22,488 --> 00:04:26,172
by means of a tracer--
in this case it's manganese--

73
00:04:26,172 --> 00:04:28,888
this is in response to activation,

74
00:04:28,888 --> 00:04:32,379
showing higher activity
in cortical layer 3 and 4

75
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:37,918
upon a stimulation,
upon a specific task.

76
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:40,277
Or here, is finally an example

77
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:45,304
of quantifying cerebral blood flow
in the brain,

78
00:04:45,292 --> 00:04:48,459
using a technique called
arterial spin labeling.

79
00:04:48,459 --> 00:04:52,542
This is in an animal
anesthetized with Î±-chloralose.

80
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:57,501
This is a normal animal, and this is
an animal subjected to hypoglycemia,

81
00:04:57,506 --> 00:04:59,705
that is low blood sugars.

82
00:05:00,163 --> 00:05:04,433
So also here, not only in a human brain
but also in the animal brain,

83
00:05:04,433 --> 00:05:07,848
we have many different contrasts
that we can obtain,

84
00:05:07,848 --> 00:05:13,726
all with the same scanner and different
depictions of what is going on,

85
00:05:13,726 --> 00:05:15,843
and these are just the examples
for the brain--

86
00:05:15,843 --> 00:05:19,784
this of course holds true
for all the other organs as well.

87
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:26,025
So then, what are the essential
components of an MRI scanner?

88
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,985
And I want to give out here a scheme
that gives you an idea

89
00:05:28,985 --> 00:05:31,994
of what's inside an MRI scanner,

90
00:05:31,994 --> 00:05:36,067
and I will also highlight
the aspects of the MRI scanner

91
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:39,192
that we are going to deal with
in this series of lectures.

92
00:05:40,262 --> 00:05:43,477
So here is a typical MRI scanner,

93
00:05:43,477 --> 00:05:45,076
again covered in a nice cover--

94
00:05:45,076 --> 00:05:48,659
patients don't want to see
the physics or the engineering--

95
00:05:48,667 --> 00:05:52,376
and this is where you enter
the magnet room as a patient;

96
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,160
what you would typically see.

97
00:05:54,502 --> 00:05:56,964
So, what is inside the scanner?

98
00:05:56,964 --> 00:06:00,780
We have inside the scanner a magnet--
it's magnetic resonance,

99
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:04,946
so there's a big magnet inside the scanner
that's inside here.

100
00:06:04,946 --> 00:06:07,425
You are going inside the magnet.

101
00:06:07,425 --> 00:06:11,868
Inside the magnet we have
gradient coils, RF coils,

102
00:06:11,868 --> 00:06:14,555
the patient table we can see here.

103
00:06:14,555 --> 00:06:18,194
This is the equivalent of this scanner
for animal scans here;

104
00:06:18,194 --> 00:06:19,674
so we use this smaller opening--

105
00:06:19,674 --> 00:06:22,418
as we've seen
with all the other imaging techniques,

106
00:06:22,438 --> 00:06:26,000
when it comes to small animal imaging,
rodent imagining,

107
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,876
the dimensions of the scanner
are being reduced,

108
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,021
at least in terms of the hole.

109
00:06:32,021 --> 00:06:37,126
So, we have the magnet,
which is here, and this is the magnet here;

110
00:06:38,128 --> 00:06:40,532
we have the gradient coils--
they are inside the cover,

111
00:06:40,532 --> 00:06:42,649
we will not see them as patients--

112
00:06:42,649 --> 00:06:44,616
they would be here.

113
00:06:44,616 --> 00:06:48,521
And we have the radio frequency coil,
which is this thing here,

114
00:06:48,521 --> 00:06:52,173
that pretty much looks like
a bird cage laying flat,

115
00:06:52,173 --> 00:06:54,334
and it's actually called a <i>bird cage</i>.

116
00:06:55,136 --> 00:06:57,305
If we take a magnet,
if we take the cover away,

117
00:06:57,305 --> 00:06:59,731
then we'll look at the open cut,

118
00:06:59,731 --> 00:07:03,256
then we can see quite a bit
of engineering and physics behind this;

119
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:08,036
a lot of copper, et cetera, that is
the magnet when you cut it open.

120
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:11,557
We don't see the magnet yet,
we just see the insides,

121
00:07:11,557 --> 00:07:14,238
so that's the gradient coil system here.

122
00:07:15,391 --> 00:07:19,597
So, if we take the entire system,
we plot it out,

123
00:07:19,597 --> 00:07:23,349
and we look at all the components,
then we see lots of different components

124
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:27,674
that are important
in making a scanner operate

125
00:07:27,674 --> 00:07:31,172
and yes, it is a complex machine.

126
00:07:31,172 --> 00:07:34,879
However, we will not focus
on <i>all</i> the aspects

127
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,039
of what's involved in running
an MRI scanner.

128
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:44,410
We'll touch upon them where necessary
to understand a few of the consequences,

129
00:07:44,410 --> 00:07:46,576
but we will not go into every detail.

130
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:48,494
What we will focus on

131
00:07:48,494 --> 00:07:51,570
is the major elements of MRI,

132
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:53,678
and that is the nucleus,

133
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:55,605
we'll focus on the magnet,

134
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:57,296
we'll focus on the RF coil,

135
00:07:57,296 --> 00:07:59,060
and we'll focus on the gradient coil.

136
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,547
Those are the elements of this scanner.

137
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:03,688
We will not focus on all the rest here,

138
00:08:03,688 --> 00:08:10,159
the addition, the important engineering,
we'll not go into much detail

139
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:15,859
for the purpose of understanding
the fundamentals of MRI.

140
00:08:18,044 --> 00:08:22,344
One thing with an MRI is it is a magnet,

141
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:27,348
and that magnet is typically,
in practice, always on.

142
00:08:28,107 --> 00:08:33,214
It is typically cooled
by superconducting wires

143
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:35,933
that are cooled to
liquid helium temperature,

144
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:37,092
so, 4 Kelvin;

145
00:08:37,092 --> 00:08:38,961
so it's cold inside there,

146
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:43,091
and the current will stay in there
for 1,000 years.

147
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:44,982
As it is superconducting,

148
00:08:44,982 --> 00:08:47,540
the resistance of the wires
is essentially zero,

149
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:49,613
so the current will stay in there,

150
00:08:49,613 --> 00:08:52,782
and the magnet is never being off.

151
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:55,486
So what are we looking at here--
what kind of magnetic field?

152
00:08:55,486 --> 00:08:59,453
[inaudible] the magnetic field generated
by the MRI magnet.

153
00:08:59,453 --> 00:09:01,334
The unit here is <i>Tesla</i>.

154
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:05,150
The Earth's magnetic field is roughly
5 times 10 to the minus five <i>Tesla</i>--

155
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:09,822
that's the magnetic field we're all
constantly experiencing.

156
00:09:10,196 --> 00:09:14,936
Electromagnets-- so you take
just the copper wire, winded like this,

157
00:09:14,936 --> 00:09:16,880
run a current through it--

158
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,478
you can produce such magnets,

159
00:09:19,478 --> 00:09:22,908
but they will have a limit
of magnetic field strength

160
00:09:22,908 --> 00:09:27,737
that is for imagining purposes,
typically below 1.5 <i>Tesla</i>.

161
00:09:28,266 --> 00:09:32,537
For MRI, what we are looking at
is magnetic field strengths

162
00:09:32,537 --> 00:09:35,521
in the range of 1-7 <i>Tesla</i>.

163
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:42,076
And this has a consequence:

164
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:45,135
we have a powerful magnet,

165
00:09:45,135 --> 00:09:47,145
it is superconducting,

166
00:09:47,145 --> 00:09:49,505
so this powerful magnet is always on.

167
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,524
We cannot come into the room,

168
00:09:51,524 --> 00:09:53,668
and quickly turn it off--
unlike a CT scanner

169
00:09:53,668 --> 00:09:56,467
where we can turn off
the X-ray tube

170
00:09:56,467 --> 00:09:58,909
and we won't have radioactivity
being produced.

171
00:09:58,909 --> 00:10:01,523
[inaudible] spec scanner

172
00:10:01,523 --> 00:10:04,284
if we don't have traces in our bodies,

173
00:10:04,284 --> 00:10:06,465
we are not exposed to any radioactivity,

174
00:10:06,465 --> 00:10:09,495
but if you enter into a room
with an MRI magnet

175
00:10:09,495 --> 00:10:15,597
you are entering a powerful magnet,
and this requires some precautions

176
00:10:15,597 --> 00:10:19,558
that I want to illustrate now,

177
00:10:19,558 --> 00:10:23,090
that one has to be cautious
around the magnet.

178
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:27,460
You can't smell the magnetic field,
you can't necessarily feel it,

179
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:30,755
and so it can have some surprises

180
00:10:30,755 --> 00:10:34,999
in the observation,
when being around the magnet

181
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:37,186
without the necessary precautions,

182
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:41,040
and that just explains why we are asking
subjects, or visitors,

183
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,930
that come close to the magnets,

184
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:45,130
the take some extra precautions.

185
00:10:46,926 --> 00:10:48,785
So, let's look at this example here.

186
00:10:48,785 --> 00:10:50,338
In this video, what you are seeing

187
00:10:50,338 --> 00:10:54,560
is an aluminum block that's placed
in front of the magnet

188
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,530
on the patient bed.

189
00:10:57,006 --> 00:10:59,991
As the aluminum block is tipped over,
it falls over.

190
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:04,717
If you now look at the aluminum block
placed inside the magnet,

191
00:11:04,717 --> 00:11:07,613
or close to the magnet--
so inside the magnetic field--

192
00:11:07,613 --> 00:11:10,599
and as the aluminum block is tipped over,

193
00:11:10,599 --> 00:11:13,014
it falls very slowly.

194
00:11:13,014 --> 00:11:17,698
What is happening here is
that as the aluminum block falls,

195
00:11:17,698 --> 00:11:18,976
changes orientation,

196
00:11:18,976 --> 00:11:21,674
the magnetic flux in the aluminum changes,

197
00:11:21,674 --> 00:11:24,883
so we have Faraday's law of induction.

198
00:11:24,883 --> 00:11:26,835
So there are,
because of the magnetic field,

199
00:11:26,835 --> 00:11:32,489
orientation across that block
is changing,

200
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:34,668
we have induced currents.

201
00:11:34,668 --> 00:11:37,715
These induced currents are producing
themselves a magnetic field

202
00:11:37,715 --> 00:11:39,675
that counteracts the main magnetic field,

203
00:11:39,675 --> 00:11:46,694
and so, this produces a force
that opposes the motion of the magnet.

204
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:51,263
This principle is used in
electromagnetic braking for example

205
00:11:51,263 --> 00:11:55,620
in the more modern hybrid cars,

206
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:00,231
when we brake without using
the physical contact,

207
00:12:00,231 --> 00:12:03,146
or in electrical trains.

208
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:06,727
Here, in this example,

209
00:12:06,727 --> 00:12:09,125
what is being done here,

210
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,146
is a tennis ball filled with nails--

211
00:12:11,146 --> 00:12:13,646
nails are ferromagnetic,

212
00:12:13,646 --> 00:12:15,888
so they are attracted
by the magnetic field--

213
00:12:15,888 --> 00:12:21,344
and the person is letting go
of the tennis ball

214
00:12:21,344 --> 00:12:23,335
filled with ferro magnetic nails,

215
00:12:23,351 --> 00:12:28,506
and it goes <i>tunk-tunk-tunk</i> into
the scanner and then sticks to the side.

216
00:12:28,506 --> 00:12:34,454
What is happening here
is the more critical effect--

217
00:12:34,454 --> 00:12:38,179
that is, we have
a ferromagnetic iron object

218
00:12:38,179 --> 00:12:41,287
that is exposed to a change
in magnetic field,

219
00:12:41,287 --> 00:12:44,339
so if we have a difference
in magnetic field across that object--

220
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:47,450
and therefore, it exerts a force
on the object,

221
00:12:47,450 --> 00:12:50,912
and that object is being attracted
such that it ultimately enters

222
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:53,229
into the scanner.

223
00:12:55,594 --> 00:13:02,032
The next example is a video surveillance
camera of a friend of mine,

224
00:13:02,032 --> 00:13:05,608
who posted it on his YouTube channel.

225
00:13:05,608 --> 00:13:10,929
So you see the two gentlemen here
were asked to enter the magnet room

226
00:13:10,929 --> 00:13:14,937
and put up a support structure, a frame,

227
00:13:14,937 --> 00:13:16,313
for putting some shelves,

228
00:13:16,313 --> 00:13:21,681
so one can put blankets and cushions,
et cetera, into the room.

229
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:28,326
Notice the one person who has
in his hands a battery-operated drill.

230
00:13:28,326 --> 00:13:33,219
So they obviously want to do
some drilling on this structure,

231
00:13:33,219 --> 00:13:36,213
or tightening some screws.

232
00:13:37,393 --> 00:13:39,554
As we are watching this video,

233
00:13:39,554 --> 00:13:41,989
you might notice at a certain time point

234
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:46,525
that he is now without the drill,

235
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:49,162
and as you are observing the two gentlemen

236
00:13:49,162 --> 00:13:52,038
they are now looking inside the magnet.

237
00:13:52,038 --> 00:13:54,112
So, what has happened?

238
00:13:55,743 --> 00:14:00,468
The drill has, most likely,
some ferromagnetic components to it--

239
00:14:00,468 --> 00:14:04,303
or at least the battery,
batteries are typically ferromagnetic--

240
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:08,878
and as he was moving around in the room,

241
00:14:08,878 --> 00:14:12,838
he wasn't paying attention to the magnet
that is in the back of the room,

242
00:14:12,838 --> 00:14:15,842
and as he got too close to the magnet,

243
00:14:15,842 --> 00:14:20,562
the magnetic field attracted the drill;

244
00:14:20,562 --> 00:14:22,179
he could no longer hold onto it,

245
00:14:22,179 --> 00:14:24,480
and it flew inside the magnet.

246
00:14:25,651 --> 00:14:27,947
In this case, there was nothing

247
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:30,350
of major consequence happening--

248
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:36,130
the drill was removed and aside
from the scare, nothing happened.

249
00:14:37,576 --> 00:14:41,468
However, in the context
of medical application,

250
00:14:41,468 --> 00:14:43,611
this is a far more serious issue.

251
00:14:44,557 --> 00:14:47,041
And here is an illustration
of an experiment

252
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,917
showing the same effect,

253
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:53,737
with a gas bottle,
just an ordinary gas bottle,

254
00:14:53,737 --> 00:14:57,158
oxygen bottle, you have
lots of oxygen bottles in the hospital.

255
00:14:57,871 --> 00:15:00,277
They are placing this bottle
on the patient bed,

256
00:15:03,307 --> 00:15:04,919
and as you can see,

257
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:09,328
on the patient bed,
instead of putting a patient

258
00:15:09,328 --> 00:15:14,833
they are putting a watermelon
as our subject

259
00:15:15,128 --> 00:15:18,552
inside the RF coil,
where the head would be.

260
00:15:19,468 --> 00:15:21,523
The experiment that was here done,

261
00:15:21,523 --> 00:15:24,065
is to illustrate what happens

262
00:15:24,065 --> 00:15:26,847
if a magnetic object

263
00:15:26,847 --> 00:15:32,851
is being put too close to the magnet,

264
00:15:34,031 --> 00:15:36,550
when it starts to get attracted
by the magnet,

265
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:38,521
what then happens.

266
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:42,177
Obviously, when it gets closer,
as we've seen with the drill,

267
00:15:42,177 --> 00:15:47,839
or the nail-filled ball,

268
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:49,456
as it gets close to the magnet,

269
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:53,330
the difference in magnetic field
creates a net force on the object.

270
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:56,233
And the force as we see
in this demonstration,

271
00:15:56,233 --> 00:15:58,780
accelerates this gas bottle,

272
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:05,735
it accelerates it towards the watermelon.

273
00:16:06,609 --> 00:16:09,049
It has an impact on the watermelon,

274
00:16:09,049 --> 00:16:11,678
and the watermelon is being crushed.

275
00:16:12,545 --> 00:16:15,915
We see this at the end of the video,
where they go to the back of the magnet

276
00:16:15,915 --> 00:16:20,589
and they show how much
this watermelon has been crushed.

277
00:16:21,781 --> 00:16:25,417
So, extreme caution is necessary
with ferromagnetic objects,

278
00:16:25,417 --> 00:16:28,645
and this is particularly difficult
in the medical context.

279
00:16:28,645 --> 00:16:34,634
This happened in the beginning
of this millennium

280
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,072
in the state of New York;

281
00:16:37,886 --> 00:16:43,805
that a subject, a cancer patient,
for control purposes was being scanned.

282
00:16:44,952 --> 00:16:48,917
A nurse heard the word
"oxygen bottle,"

283
00:16:48,917 --> 00:16:50,589
went to the hallway,

284
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:54,556
grabbed the oxygen bottle, walked with
the oxygen bottle into the room;

285
00:16:54,556 --> 00:16:56,751
the oxygen bottle got attracted,

286
00:16:56,751 --> 00:16:58,807
and unfortunately, for the subject

287
00:16:58,807 --> 00:17:01,055
..the subject was still in the magnet--

288
00:17:01,055 --> 00:17:04,280
that created, of course,

289
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:08,564
an unfortunate death of this subject.

290
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:13,192
The difficulty here is,
as medical professionals are trained

291
00:17:13,192 --> 00:17:15,626
to react in emergency situations,

292
00:17:15,626 --> 00:17:20,042
they are not all trained to work
and live around the magnet,

293
00:17:20,042 --> 00:17:24,932
and so, the first response
is to help the patient,

294
00:17:24,932 --> 00:17:28,825
and so, yes, you grab the oxygen bottle,
you run into the room,

295
00:17:28,825 --> 00:17:33,845
and the oxygen bottle is being attracted;
that's the situation here.

296
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:37,700
It requires specific measures;

297
00:17:38,088 --> 00:17:41,472
the measures are to take off
all magnetic things that we carry

298
00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:43,071
on ourselves,

299
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:45,266
and in the case of a medical emergency,

300
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:47,162
in an MRI scanner--

301
00:17:47,162 --> 00:17:51,212
what one would do is actually,
the first reaction,

302
00:17:51,212 --> 00:17:55,033
is to take the subject out of the magnet
and out of the magnet room,

303
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:59,558
and then only start coming in
with medical equipment.

304
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:01,447
CPR is obviously fine,

305
00:18:01,447 --> 00:18:05,031
but one has to be extremely vigilant

306
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:09,250
because we do not feel, we do not smell,
we do not see the magnetic field.

307
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:11,988
So, to give you an illustration,

308
00:18:11,988 --> 00:18:14,018
here's an example of a magnet,

309
00:18:14,018 --> 00:18:15,960
with a chair attached to it.

310
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,502
This chair has obviously a lot
of ferromagnetic material

311
00:18:20,502 --> 00:18:22,995
and you can see
the quite considerable effort

312
00:18:22,995 --> 00:18:25,707
that it takes to remove that chair;

313
00:18:25,707 --> 00:18:28,497
it's a chair with wheels on it,

314
00:18:28,497 --> 00:18:30,834
so it somehow got too close
to the magnet,

315
00:18:30,834 --> 00:18:34,033
was suddenly attracted, and <i>bang!</i>
it went into the magnet.

316
00:18:34,033 --> 00:18:40,067
And you can appreciate from
the effort that's being done

317
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:43,238
how strong these forces are
on the chair.

318
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:44,771
And obviously, once one is away

319
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:47,149
where the magnetic field
doesn't vary a lot,

320
00:18:47,149 --> 00:18:51,535
then this force is
substantially being reduced

321
00:18:51,535 --> 00:18:54,612
and we have less to consider.

322
00:18:54,612 --> 00:18:57,750
It really is a matter of the vicinity
of the magnet,

323
00:18:57,750 --> 00:19:01,592
where the magnetic field changes
very strongly.

324
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:06,840
So this is a danger of MRI scanners.

325
00:19:06,840 --> 00:19:09,457
It's not a biological risk, it's a danger;

326
00:19:09,457 --> 00:19:12,723
it's just like walking
up and down the stairs--

327
00:19:12,723 --> 00:19:15,610
if you don't pay attention,
you can fall and break your neck.

328
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:17,674
Here we have to be around the magnet,

329
00:19:17,674 --> 00:19:19,846
we have to be cautious, making sure

330
00:19:19,846 --> 00:19:24,171
that ferromagnetic objects
stay far away from our subject

331
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:25,913
and from the scanner,

332
00:19:26,183 --> 00:19:28,981
and then, we are OK.

333
00:19:31,402 --> 00:19:33,249
Another issue that I want to address

334
00:19:33,249 --> 00:19:36,329
is of some historical interest,

335
00:19:36,329 --> 00:19:39,303
especially with the perspective of Europe.

336
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:44,491
But the question is-- let's say 
we forget about ferromagnetic objects

337
00:19:44,491 --> 00:19:47,097
and we're just ourselves
walking around the magnet.

338
00:19:47,903 --> 00:19:52,747
The question is what kind of exposures
of magnetic field changes

339
00:19:52,747 --> 00:19:57,203
can we subject ourselves to?

340
00:19:58,790 --> 00:20:02,277
I want to make here the example,
by comparison,

341
00:20:02,277 --> 00:20:04,843
comparing the effects that we see

342
00:20:04,843 --> 00:20:08,246
with transcranial magnetic stimulation.

343
00:20:08,246 --> 00:20:12,033
Transcranial magnetic stimulation
is a technique used in neuroscience

344
00:20:12,033 --> 00:20:15,863
to investigate the functioning
of certain brain areas.

345
00:20:15,863 --> 00:20:20,932
It is allowed in healthy volunteers

346
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:25,574
and these policies
are applied quite frequently.

347
00:20:25,574 --> 00:20:29,088
I want to relate what we are--

348
00:20:30,074 --> 00:20:34,388
if we move around the magnet,
what this means in relation to TMS.

349
00:20:35,113 --> 00:20:36,566
Here's a TMS scanner;

350
00:20:36,566 --> 00:20:40,347
here's the coil that produces
the magnetic field;

351
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:42,086
the subject here.

352
00:20:42,086 --> 00:20:43,629
What is being done

353
00:20:43,629 --> 00:20:48,522
is one produces a magnetic field,
<i>B_zero</i>, with this coil

354
00:20:48,522 --> 00:20:51,788
that goes from zero to two <i>Tesla</i>
in roughly 100 microseconds.

355
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:56,321
If we take a conservative estimate,

356
00:20:56,321 --> 00:21:02,401
this amounts to 20,000 <i>Tesla</i> per second
change in magnetic field, dB/dt.

357
00:21:03,298 --> 00:21:05,711
What I want to do with this calculation,

358
00:21:05,711 --> 00:21:07,347
just to give you an idea,

359
00:21:07,347 --> 00:21:10,736
to produce a similar change
in magnetic field,

360
00:21:12,076 --> 00:21:15,870
how fast would we have to walk
to a 7 <i>Tesla</i> scanner

361
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:18,516
over a distance of 1.4.meters?

362
00:21:18,516 --> 00:21:22,337
We'll assume we go over 1.4 meters
from zero to seven <i>Tesla</i>,

363
00:21:22,937 --> 00:21:27,537
and we want to expose ourselves to
the same change of magnetic field per time.

364
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:34,173
So we have a change in magnetic field
per distance, which is 5 <i>Tesla</i> per meter,

365
00:21:34,173 --> 00:21:35,876
we have 7 divided by 1.4,

366
00:21:35,876 --> 00:21:39,384
so this gives us 5 <i>Teslas</i> per meter.

367
00:21:39,384 --> 00:21:42,643
We want to now have a change
in magnetic field per time--

368
00:21:42,643 --> 00:21:45,935
so that's velocity over distance--

369
00:21:45,935 --> 00:21:50,039
that gives us per time
times the change in magnetic field.

370
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:53,514
We want this to be 20,000 <i>Tesla</i> per second.

371
00:21:54,328 --> 00:21:55,973
We can solve this,

372
00:21:55,973 --> 00:21:58,748
so we can calculate what velocity
would we need

373
00:21:58,748 --> 00:22:04,223
to produce a magnetic field change
of 20,000 <i>Tesla</i> per second.

374
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:08,392
The calculation here,
as you can easily verify,

375
00:22:08,392 --> 00:22:14,956
produces a velocity of 4,000 meters
per second, or 14,000 kilometers per hour.

376
00:22:15,981 --> 00:22:19,872
This is essentially, ten times
the Earth's rotational speed.

377
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,521
That's a tremendous velocity.

378
00:22:24,523 --> 00:22:25,871
This is is very crude,

379
00:22:25,871 --> 00:22:29,258
and is, by no means, meant to be correct,

380
00:22:29,258 --> 00:22:31,925
but let's go a little bit
into finer details.

381
00:22:31,925 --> 00:22:34,271
And we'll look at Faraday's law
in more detail.

382
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:37,227
We have Faraday's law, which says
the induced voltage

383
00:22:37,227 --> 00:22:42,630
is equal to the area times the change
in magnetic field per time.

384
00:22:44,074 --> 00:22:45,973
So we're obviously having--

385
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:48,782
with the transcranial magnetic stimulation--

386
00:22:48,782 --> 00:22:52,566
weâre not having the same area exposed
to the magnetic field

387
00:22:52,566 --> 00:22:55,433
as we have with our body,
as we run towards the magnet,

388
00:22:55,433 --> 00:22:58,545
so we'll correct for the surface area.

389
00:22:59,076 --> 00:23:01,289
The TMS coil with a radius of 5 cm,

390
00:23:01,289 --> 00:23:05,823
we can calculate an area of .008 m2.

391
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:10,768
We'll estimate that the upper trunk
is roughly half a square meter

392
00:23:10,768 --> 00:23:13,633
of surface area-- we'll correct that;

393
00:23:13,637 --> 00:23:18,456
and then we are getting, from correcting
for the fact that our area is bigger

394
00:23:18,456 --> 00:23:20,887
than the area of the TMS coil,

395
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:23,308
to have the same induced voltage
in our body,

396
00:23:23,308 --> 00:23:27,431
we are obtaining a velocity
of 63 meters per second,

397
00:23:27,431 --> 00:23:29,974
or 220 kilometers per hour.

398
00:23:31,056 --> 00:23:33,513
So, if we run towards the magnet,

399
00:23:33,513 --> 00:23:37,867
and we go from zero to seven <i>Tesla</i>
over a distance of 1.4 meters,

400
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:41,709
we are going to be exposed
in the upper trunk to voltages

401
00:23:41,709 --> 00:23:49,571
that correspond to those that
we are exposed to in the brain with TMS

402
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:52,516
at 220 kilometers per hour.

403
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:57,715
What we have to consider is
for most modern magnets

404
00:23:57,715 --> 00:24:01,268
most of the static magnetic field
is actually within the bore of the magnet--

405
00:24:01,268 --> 00:24:04,240
that is, within the structure--

406
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,801
so we actually, if we are on the outside,
we can't even expose ourselves

407
00:24:07,801 --> 00:24:10,799
to the full 7 <i>Tesla</i>.

408
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:15,709
That also means that most of the changes
happening in there,

409
00:24:15,709 --> 00:24:19,188
we don't start at zero <i>Tesla</i>,

410
00:24:19,188 --> 00:24:22,163
we don't end at 7 <i>Tesla</i>.

411
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:27,308
We have also the fact that the distance
is more like 7 meters

412
00:24:27,308 --> 00:24:30,799
over which we approach the magnet,
and not 1.4 meters.

413
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:34,917
So, if we actually wanted
to expose ourselves

414
00:24:34,917 --> 00:24:39,013
to the same effect
around a magnetic field,

415
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:43,181
then the equivalent speed to produce
the same voltages as we have with TMS

416
00:24:43,181 --> 00:24:46,677
would be several-fold higher
than 220 kilometers per hour.

417
00:24:47,624 --> 00:24:49,539
And, let's be honest, in reality,

418
00:24:49,539 --> 00:24:52,194
our speed is going to be

419
00:24:52,194 --> 00:24:56,848
already two orders of magnitude
lower than what is here.

420
00:24:56,848 --> 00:24:58,998
So it is my opinion here

421
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:03,921
that the considerations about motion
around a static magnetic field--

422
00:25:03,921 --> 00:25:08,876
around an MRI scanner--

423
00:25:08,876 --> 00:25:14,305
are so low, the induced voltages
are well beyond any concern

424
00:25:14,305 --> 00:25:17,824
that we should have and are having.
