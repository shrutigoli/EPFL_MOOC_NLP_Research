1
00:00:04,565 --> 00:00:11,560
So now we have dealt with
the difference in population,

2
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,545
we have dealt with the introduction
of a magnetic moment.

3
00:00:14,545 --> 00:00:17,608
Now we are going to have to 
address the question:

4
00:00:17,608 --> 00:00:21,386
"How does this generate 
a macroscopic magnetic field?"

5
00:00:21,386 --> 00:00:23,679
And this is what we call 
the magnetization.

6
00:00:23,679 --> 00:00:28,150
So how do we see this motion?

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,988
Now we'll do--by the following analogy 
again, to classical physics--

8
00:00:33,988 --> 00:00:38,759
we'll view each spin, each nucleus 
as a magnetic dipole <i>mu</i>--

9
00:00:38,759 --> 00:00:43,801
that is, we can visualize it 
without it having any resemblance

10
00:00:43,801 --> 00:00:48,619
to the actual situation.
It's just the electromagnetic properties

11
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:52,751
but we can think of it 
as a virtual tiny bar magnet.

12
00:00:55,561 --> 00:01:00,118
Now classically, as I mentioned before,
the magnetic field

13
00:01:00,798 --> 00:01:03,818
exerts a torque on that dipole,
a torque <i>tau</i>

14
00:01:03,818 --> 00:01:06,043
and this torque is given by 
the vector product

15
00:01:06,043 --> 00:01:11,014
of the magnetic moment of that spin 
with the external magnetic field.

16
00:01:11,544 --> 00:01:13,506
Now we'll take the second law of rotations

17
00:01:13,506 --> 00:01:16,645
and here <i>P</i> denotes the angular momentum.

18
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:18,941
So we know from 
the second law of rotations

19
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:22,974
that the derivative of angular momentum 
with time is equal to the net torque.

20
00:01:22,974 --> 00:01:24,845
Here we have one torque.

21
00:01:24,845 --> 00:01:26,859
And we can now use this

22
00:01:26,859 --> 00:01:30,836
and substitute the angular momentum

23
00:01:30,836 --> 00:01:34,146
with the magnetic moment.

24
00:01:36,456 --> 00:01:40,598
We'll do this on both sides 
and then we are getting that

25
00:01:40,598 --> 00:01:45,419
the derivative, classically, of a spin.

26
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:48,907
The derivative of its magnetic moment
is equal to the magnetic moment

27
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:53,249
times <i>gamma B</i>
where <i>B</i> is the external field.

28
00:01:53,249 --> 00:01:54,400
So this is the motion

29
00:01:54,400 --> 00:02:00,070
for an individual spin equation 
of motion, classically.

30
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:03,969
Now if we sum over 
all the magnetic moments

31
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:08,371
that are in our voxel, 
all the hydrogen nuclei,

32
00:02:08,371 --> 00:02:13,228
all the protons that we have in there,
we sum all the magnetic moments

33
00:02:13,228 --> 00:02:18,049
then we get the macroscopically measured
magnetization.

34
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:20,442
So this is--we define this magnetization

35
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:25,505
as the sum of all magnetic moments
present in our voxel.

36
00:02:27,042 --> 00:02:30,143
Then we can do the summation 
over this differential equation

37
00:02:30,143 --> 00:02:34,643
that we have here and we obtain 
the so-called <i>Larmor equation,</i>

38
00:02:35,713 --> 00:02:41,993
which is given here by the derivative of
the magnetization with time

39
00:02:41,993 --> 00:02:46,974
is equal to minus <i>gamma B</i> cross <i>M,</i>
that's the vector product.

40
00:02:50,094 --> 00:02:54,383
Now what does this Larmor equation 
describe?

41
00:02:56,262 --> 00:02:58,956
Have you seen a similar equation already?

42
00:03:00,945 --> 00:03:02,934
Well, let's look at this.

43
00:03:03,944 --> 00:03:06,411
So what does this Larmor equation 
describe?

44
00:03:07,235 --> 00:03:11,411
And to make the analogy, I'll go back 
to your first year physics course

45
00:03:11,411 --> 00:03:13,975
and we'll look at rotational kinematics.

46
00:03:14,948 --> 00:03:16,806
We'll do a brief digression here.

47
00:03:16,806 --> 00:03:22,057
We've had, for a circular motion,
we had the relationship between velocity,

48
00:03:22,057 --> 00:03:28,382
angular velocity and the radius 
of our circular motion.

49
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:32,959
And if you look at this in vector form,
we had velocity is equal to

50
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,749
the vector product of the angular velocity
with the position of our object.

51
00:03:39,979 --> 00:03:42,600
Now I can rewrite this equation 
for our circular motion

52
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:45,059
by replacing the definition of velocity,

53
00:03:45,059 --> 00:03:47,942
which is the derivative 
of the position with time,

54
00:03:47,942 --> 00:03:52,801
and that is equal to 
the vector product of <i>omega</i> cross <i>r.</i>

55
00:03:53,852 --> 00:03:57,969
Now this motion, we have seen 
in the first year course,

56
00:03:57,969 --> 00:04:02,653
this describes the rotation 
of the vector <i>r</i> about the vector <i>omega</i>

57
00:04:02,653 --> 00:04:06,161
with a frequency of <i>omega</i> divided by <i>2π.</i>

58
00:04:06,891 --> 00:04:10,083
So we have here 
the angular velocity vector.

59
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:14,972
I will draw now the position vector <i>r, </i>
here.

60
00:04:14,972 --> 00:04:18,905
I'll put the tip of the position 
of our object in motion.

61
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:23,124
That's our object-- so the vector <i>r</i>
describes the position of this object.

62
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:26,145
And that's exactly the motion that we see.

63
00:04:26,145 --> 00:04:30,676
We have the component of the position
perpendicular to <i>omega,</i>

64
00:04:30,676 --> 00:04:33,975
which moves in a circular motion,
it rotates.

65
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:39,196
And the component that's parallel 
to <i>omega</i> is stationary, it is constant

66
00:04:39,196 --> 00:04:44,127
because we can see here,
we can always decompose the vector <i>r</i>

67
00:04:44,127 --> 00:04:46,354
into one that's parallel 
and perpendicular to <i>omega,</i>

68
00:04:46,354 --> 00:04:48,641
the one that's parallel, 
the vector product is null

69
00:04:48,641 --> 00:04:52,336
so that component 
does not change with time.

70
00:04:53,396 --> 00:04:57,604
So that's essentially that motion 
that we classically have

71
00:04:57,604 --> 00:04:59,409
for the position vector.

72
00:04:59,409 --> 00:05:04,502
Now in this equation here, 
I can substitute the position vector <i>r</i>

73
00:05:04,502 --> 00:05:07,189
with any quantity, 
be it angular momentum <i>L,</i>

74
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:11,128
be it the magnetization vector, 
and I'll have an equation

75
00:05:11,128 --> 00:05:14,379
that is formally equivalent 
to what we have here.

76
00:05:14,379 --> 00:05:19,199
I'll substitute <i>r</i> with <i>M,</i>
I'll substitute <i>omega</i> with minus <i>gamma B</i>

77
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,379
and you can see that mathematically,

78
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:26,481
the two equations 
are perfectly homologous, analogous,

79
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:29,928
they describe the same motion for now,
for a different vector.

80
00:05:29,928 --> 00:05:34,431
So if the <i>r</i> does--around <i>omega--</i>
does a motion like this,

81
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:40,141
then the <i>M</i>--the magnetization--
will do a motion around <i>B</i>

82
00:05:40,141 --> 00:05:42,021
in the same fashion.

83
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:44,832
And this motion we call <i>precession</i>
so what we have now

84
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:48,125
is the Larmor equation describes
the precession of the magnetization

85
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,343
around the magnetic field <i>B</i>

86
00:05:50,343 --> 00:05:54,342
with a frequency that's given 
by <i>gamma B</i> over <i>2π.</i>

87
00:05:55,082 --> 00:05:57,621
So this is important, 
this motion of precession

88
00:05:57,621 --> 00:06:01,174
of the magnetization 
about the magnetic field,

89
00:06:01,174 --> 00:06:02,955
this relationship is very important.

90
00:06:02,955 --> 00:06:06,648
We're going to use it
over and over again in the next weeks.

91
00:06:08,048 --> 00:06:09,276
So what is precession?

92
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:13,066
And here I'll go back again 
to classical mechanics.

93
00:06:13,066 --> 00:06:16,176
We'll take a very simple experiment.

94
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:19,367
We'll have a wheel 
that is suspended on a string.

95
00:06:19,367 --> 00:06:20,982
The wheel has a certain mass

96
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:24,325
and the wheel turns 
with a certain angular velocity.

97
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:28,097
So if it turns with this angular velocity
the wheel will develop, here,

98
00:06:28,097 --> 00:06:32,298
an angular momentum <i>L,</i>
here indicated by the blue vector.

99
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:35,915
The wheel is suspended at the point <i>O</i>

100
00:06:35,915 --> 00:06:41,411
and we can now make some observations
in the experiment,

101
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:44,869
and this we will demonstrate.

102
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:48,549
Okay, as mentioned in the course,

103
00:06:48,549 --> 00:06:50,660
we have an analogy 
in the motion of magnetization

104
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,911
with classical mechanics

105
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:55,061
and this is the experiment 
I want to illustrate this.

106
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:58,895
We have the wheel suspended here
at the yellow wire.

107
00:06:58,895 --> 00:07:03,690
The yellow wire 
will maintain its position here.

108
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,411
I will give it a spin so it will develop 
an angular momentum

109
00:07:07,411 --> 00:07:08,830
and from the equations of motion

110
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,154
that we've discussed 
from classical mechanics,

111
00:07:11,154 --> 00:07:14,242
there will be a torque 
from this string tension

112
00:07:14,242 --> 00:07:18,584
that will force the angular momentum
into a motion of precession.

113
00:07:18,584 --> 00:07:23,885
We've established in classical mechanics
that this motion of precession,

114
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:29,025
of the angular momentum vector
corresponds to one of precession.

115
00:07:29,025 --> 00:07:31,176
So I will now spin it this way

116
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:34,214
so the angular momentum 
points in this direction.

117
00:07:38,604 --> 00:07:43,087
So here we have the wheel now turning
and now when I cut the wire here,

118
00:07:43,735 --> 00:07:47,117
we can see that there is now the motion--
the angular momentum vector

119
00:07:47,117 --> 00:07:52,785
is now going on a circular motion.
That is the motion of precession.

120
00:07:54,738 --> 00:07:57,758
This motion does require 
the presence of an angular momentum.

121
00:07:57,758 --> 00:08:00,839
If there is no angular momentum 
associated with the wheel

122
00:08:00,839 --> 00:08:05,307
we of course have--
it just falls down as such.

123
00:08:05,307 --> 00:08:07,999
So I can also start this experiment 
this way.

124
00:08:09,149 --> 00:08:13,630
I don't need the wire. Again, 
this demonstrates motion of precession.

125
00:08:16,216 --> 00:08:18,378
Now as we have seen in the demonstration

126
00:08:18,378 --> 00:08:23,089
the motion of the axis of the wheel
is circular about the point <i>O</i>

127
00:08:23,089 --> 00:08:25,572
and it has a constant angular velocity,

128
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:29,491
which is vertical to the angular momentum.

129
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,073
Here's the center of mass of our wheel

130
00:08:32,073 --> 00:08:37,061
and we will now calculate the motion here.

131
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:40,152
Now the motion that we've seen 
for the angular momentum is circular

132
00:08:40,152 --> 00:08:42,709
so we know that the precession equation--

133
00:08:42,709 --> 00:08:44,751
that is here again 
now for the angular momentum--

134
00:08:44,751 --> 00:08:49,353
is valid in describing 
the motion of the angular momentum.

135
00:08:50,133 --> 00:08:54,459
Now we want to calculate here 
the precession frequency

136
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:59,143
because it bears some analogy
to the magnetization.

137
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:04,102
So we have our angular momentum.

138
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:08,172
Our center of mass is a distance <i>r</i>
away from the suspension point.

139
00:09:08,172 --> 00:09:10,831
We have the mass here, that's one fourth.

140
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:13,084
The wheel does not fall 
as we've seen in the experiment

141
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:15,779
so we have the string tension,

142
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:19,048
which is the same, 
is the weight of the wheel upwards.

143
00:09:19,475 --> 00:09:22,822
Now we can calculate the derivative
of the angular momentum,

144
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:24,066
which is equal to the torque.

145
00:09:24,066 --> 00:09:27,037
We have only one torque that acts on here.

146
00:09:27,037 --> 00:09:30,045
Whether we use point <i>O</i>
or the center of mass as a reference point

147
00:09:30,045 --> 00:09:33,517
we'll end up with the same equation,
so I won't make the distinction here.

148
00:09:33,517 --> 00:09:36,069
It is <i>r</i> cross force,

149
00:09:36,069 --> 00:09:40,219
so this minus if I put the force 
before the <i>r.</i>

150
00:09:40,219 --> 00:09:42,447
That's the definition of torque.

151
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:45,718
So we have the torque in this direction

152
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:51,300
and this gives us the orientation
of the change of angular momentum.

153
00:09:52,507 --> 00:09:54,028
Now I'll rewrite the equation here

154
00:09:54,028 --> 00:09:58,638
by dividing by the norm of the vector <i>r</i>
and multiplying by its length.

155
00:09:58,638 --> 00:10:01,691
So length here, length here,
but I'll put it here.

156
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:07,086
Now, the vector <i>r</i> divided by its length
is basically a vector that has unit length

157
00:10:07,086 --> 00:10:10,402
so it's a unitary vector.

158
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,922
And I will use the fact that the axis,

159
00:10:12,922 --> 00:10:14,660
the orientation of the axis of the wheel

160
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:16,786
and the orientation 
of the angular momentum

161
00:10:16,786 --> 00:10:22,624
are largely colinear so I can replace
<i>r over r</i> with <i>L over L,</i>

162
00:10:22,624 --> 00:10:25,402
which is what we are now going to do here.

163
00:10:25,872 --> 00:10:28,042
And this gives us this equation here.

164
00:10:28,042 --> 00:10:30,925
So we now have replaced this term here
by this term

165
00:10:30,925 --> 00:10:33,022
and then we get this equation.

166
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:36,783
If I regroup this then we have 
the derivative of the angular momentum

167
00:10:36,783 --> 00:10:40,928
is some term times the angular momentum

168
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:44,322
and this is essentially 
our precession frequency.

169
00:10:45,022 --> 00:10:47,525
I'll use the definition 
of the angular momentum,

170
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:50,934
so it's <i>I omega,</i>
<i>I</i> as being the moment of inertia,

171
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:56,936
and then we have the precession frequency
is equal to the radius times the mass

172
00:10:56,936 --> 00:11:03,007
times gravitational acceleration--the <i>g--</i>
divided by <i>I omega.</i>

173
00:11:03,857 --> 00:11:07,044
So that's our precession frequency here
derived.

174
00:11:08,408 --> 00:11:11,357
Compare this to the equation 
that we have here--

175
00:11:11,357 --> 00:11:13,577
we have the <i>omega</i> here, 
we have this value--

176
00:11:13,577 --> 00:11:17,092
and to the equation of the magnetization.

177
00:11:18,106 --> 00:11:23,268
It is basically our magnetization 
does a motion just like a spinning top.

178
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:28,044
And hence, we can look at now 
some factors that increase--

179
00:11:28,044 --> 00:11:31,610
if you look at the wheel, 
if the mass of the wheel increases

180
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,339
the precession frequency increases.

181
00:11:34,339 --> 00:11:37,670
Well, this is linked to--

182
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,976
plays the same role as--
the gyromagnetic ratio

183
00:11:39,976 --> 00:11:43,340
and hence, because the motion is similar
to that of a gyroscope,

184
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:46,880
the <i>gamma</i> is called <i>gyromagnetic ratio.</i>

185
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,760
And then we have also 
the gravitational pull,

186
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,503
if we have more gravitational pull,
our wheel turns faster

187
00:11:53,503 --> 00:12:00,183
so the gravitational pull takes the role 
of the external magnetic field.

188
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:05,630
So this is illustrated in this video
that we are seeing.

189
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,793
So we are first seeing--
what we are seeing is a gyroscope,

190
00:12:10,793 --> 00:12:14,894
a spinning top rotating 
just like we have here on the animation,

191
00:12:14,894 --> 00:12:18,215
rotating first vertically.
It's put in an elevator

192
00:12:18,215 --> 00:12:22,256
and this elevator is then let fall 
in freefall to the ground.

193
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,535
The first experiment 
is not very interesting.

194
00:12:25,535 --> 00:12:29,905
We see that the gyroscope 
detaches from the support.

195
00:12:29,905 --> 00:12:32,335
The second experiment 
that we are looking at--

196
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:35,687
the second gyro-drop--
here we have the gyroscope precessing

197
00:12:35,687 --> 00:12:38,757
just like we've seen for the wheel
and that gyroscope--

198
00:12:40,537 --> 00:12:45,046
the minute it is no longer exposed 
to gravitation,

199
00:12:45,046 --> 00:12:47,608
the minute there is no longer a torque
exerted on the gyroscope,

200
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:49,568
it stops immediately precessing.

201
00:12:49,568 --> 00:12:53,928
That's as if we had magically turned off 
the gravitation--same effect--

202
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:57,120
or if we had turned off 
the magnetic field.
