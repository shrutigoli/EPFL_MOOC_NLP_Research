1
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:08,034
By now we have learned quite a bit 
about magnetic resonance,

2
00:00:08,034 --> 00:00:11,534
and I want to recap the essentials,
as we know them so far.

3
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:16,812
We have a nuclear equilibrium 
magnetization <i>M_0</i> that develops.

4
00:00:16,812 --> 00:00:20,221
If you enter a magnet,
your nuclei in your body

5
00:00:20,221 --> 00:00:22,911
will develop a nuclear 
equilibrium magnetization.

6
00:00:22,911 --> 00:00:26,649
This magnetization 
is given by the difference

7
00:00:26,649 --> 00:00:29,819
in the number of spins 
in the upper and lower energy level--

8
00:00:29,819 --> 00:00:33,259
the difference between two
times their magnetic moment.

9
00:00:34,218 --> 00:00:36,328
I will rewrite this equation here--

10
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:41,178
so, will write it in this form: 
I will have now <i>N_1 / N_2</i>,

11
00:00:41,178 --> 00:00:43,758
where we can use 
the Boltzman distribution.

12
00:00:44,318 --> 00:00:48,588
So, <i>N_1 / N_2</i>, the Boltzman distribution 
has been used here.

13
00:00:49,116 --> 00:00:52,815
And now what we will do is, 
we will use the linearization

14
00:00:52,815 --> 00:00:55,775
because we have said <i>Δ E / k T</i>
is very small,

15
00:00:55,775 --> 00:01:00,985
so <i>e</i> to the <i>- x</i>
can be approximated by <i>(1 - x)</i>,

16
00:01:00,985 --> 00:01:03,415
if <i>x</i> is very small compared to 1.

17
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:06,444
And then with this linearization 
of the equation

18
00:01:06,444 --> 00:01:09,674
we have, the magnetization 
is given by this term here,

19
00:01:09,674 --> 00:01:11,870
and then I will substitute the <i>Δ E</i>

20
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:14,590
with the term 
that we have seen previously,

21
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,990
and this is now the nuclear magnetization,

22
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,940
macroscopic equilibrium magnetization 
that we have.

23
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,789
Now we will substitute for the fact

24
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:27,469
that <i>N_2</i> is essentially 
half of all the spins--

25
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:32,559
this is to a very good approximation true,

26
00:01:32,559 --> 00:01:35,589
and then we obtain this expression here.

27
00:01:35,589 --> 00:01:39,409
So the magnetization is given 
by some constants of the system:

28
00:01:39,409 --> 00:01:42,954
Boltzman constant, temperature 
we can assume as constant,

29
00:01:42,954 --> 00:01:46,892
Boltzman constant, Planck's constant, 
the dipole moment

30
00:01:46,892 --> 00:01:52,112
and then we have gyromagnetic ratio,
<i>B_0</i> and the number of spins.

31
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,870
So this is the resulting relationship, 
and I will stress here--

32
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,296
it is good to understand 
this relationship,

33
00:02:00,296 --> 00:02:02,616
some dependencies here.

34
00:02:02,616 --> 00:02:06,096
And we have the magnetization here

35
00:02:07,915 --> 00:02:15,595
increases with the following terms:

36
00:02:15,825 --> 00:02:18,296
the number of spins--

37
00:02:18,296 --> 00:02:20,386
so that is essentially 
the number of molecules.

38
00:02:20,386 --> 00:02:25,133
If we increase <i>N</i>, 
then the magnetization increases.

39
00:02:25,753 --> 00:02:29,453
If we increase the magnetic field, 
then the magnetization increases--

40
00:02:29,468 --> 00:02:31,418
that's this term here <i>B_0</i>.

41
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:34,706
If we increase the gyromagnetic ratio <i>γ</i>,

42
00:02:34,706 --> 00:02:40,796
then the thermodynamic 
equilibrium magnetization increases.

43
00:02:43,336 --> 00:02:45,386
So, taking all this together,

44
00:02:46,426 --> 00:02:48,117
for magnetic resonance imaging,

45
00:02:48,117 --> 00:02:53,477
which nucleus 
is the most favorable to look at?

46
00:02:54,097 --> 00:02:57,017
If we look at these three values here,

47
00:02:57,017 --> 00:03:00,547
we can control experimentally only one--
that's the magnetic field

48
00:03:00,547 --> 00:03:03,177
that's produced by the magnet 
that we construct.

49
00:03:03,617 --> 00:03:07,557
The number of spins 
is given by the organ under investigation,

50
00:03:07,557 --> 00:03:10,017
the gyromagnetic ratio by the nucleus.

51
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:13,247
So we need to find a nucleus 
with a high gyromagnetic ratio

52
00:03:13,247 --> 00:03:16,457
and a high number of spins.

53
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:23,805
And so this is essentially 
the hydrogen nucleus,

54
00:03:23,805 --> 00:03:28,386
H1 is the proton, has the highest <i>γ</i>, 
as we have seen before,

55
00:03:28,386 --> 00:03:30,816
and water is highly concentrated.

56
00:03:31,376 --> 00:03:33,420
Whether we like it or not,

57
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,292
typically 80% of our body is water.

58
00:03:36,292 --> 00:03:39,323
So for MRI we are mainly focusing

59
00:03:39,323 --> 00:03:44,423
on imaging the hydrogen atom in water.

60
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:52,358
So, we will take the Larmor equation here,
and here I want to introduce the term

61
00:03:52,358 --> 00:03:55,740
that we have--from this we can glean--
the Larmor frequency,

62
00:03:55,740 --> 00:04:00,700
which is given by <i>γ B_0 / (2 π)</i>, 
that's in hertz, so it's a frequency;

63
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,518
if we take angle velocity 
in radian per second

64
00:04:03,518 --> 00:04:07,443
then the <i>ω_L</i>, 
the Lamor frequency, is <i>γ B_0</i>.

65
00:04:07,443 --> 00:04:09,423
This we have to bear in mind.

66
00:04:10,403 --> 00:04:13,814
One thing that is non-negotiable 
in magnetic resonance

67
00:04:13,814 --> 00:04:17,670
is a convention 
about the reference system,

68
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:21,190
the coordinate system.

69
00:04:21,190 --> 00:04:24,920
The static magnetic field <i>B_0</i>
that we generate with our magnet

70
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:28,630
the static magnet, the magnetic field 
generated by our scanner.

71
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:33,680
That magnetic field 
is by definition always along <i>z</i>.

72
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,700
We do not negotiate 
this convention--it is fixed.

73
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,085
So that is always 
along the magnetic field--it's along <i>z</i>.

74
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,562
Then we have
the equilibrium magnetization

75
00:04:46,562 --> 00:04:48,682
is also along <i>z</i>.

76
00:04:50,642 --> 00:04:52,546
The thermodynamic 
equilibrium magnetization

77
00:04:52,546 --> 00:04:55,131
is always parallel along <i>z</i>.

78
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:59,171
And I want to give a great credit here 
to Edward Purcell,

79
00:04:59,173 --> 00:05:03,953
who discovered nuclear magnetic resonance

80
00:05:03,953 --> 00:05:07,203
and received the Nobel Prize 
for Physics in 1952.

81
00:05:09,709 --> 00:05:11,478
Quantum mechanics will tell you

82
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:14,478
that the spin will never align 
with the magnetic field--

83
00:05:14,478 --> 00:05:17,108
there is always a transverse component.

84
00:05:17,628 --> 00:05:20,428
However, the thermodynamic
equilibrium magnetization

85
00:05:20,428 --> 00:05:25,298
is always along <i>z</i> and does not have 
a transverse component,

86
00:05:25,298 --> 00:05:29,286
and in the Appendix that we provide 
as <i>PDF</i> on this course

87
00:05:29,874 --> 00:05:33,544
the explanation is provided 
by the random phase approximation

88
00:05:33,544 --> 00:05:35,874
of equilibrium magnetization,

89
00:05:35,874 --> 00:05:39,244
so why there is no 
net transverse component

90
00:05:39,244 --> 00:05:41,860
of the magnetization 
at thermodynamic equilibrium.

91
00:05:44,652 --> 00:05:49,972
We need a magnet to generate 
a magnetic field that's along <i>z</i>.

92
00:05:50,899 --> 00:05:56,559
This results in a separation of the spins
in the upper and lower energy level,

93
00:05:56,559 --> 00:06:01,283
which creates a thermodynamic 
equilibrium magnetization <i>M_0</i>.

94
00:06:02,115 --> 00:06:04,435
We will call the main 
magnetic field always <i>B_0</i>,

95
00:06:04,435 --> 00:06:07,895
and we will call 
the equilibrium magnetization always <i>N_0</i>.

96
00:06:08,994 --> 00:06:12,131
Now, if we look at the energy difference 
here, the <i>Δ E</i>,

97
00:06:12,131 --> 00:06:14,991
we find it is actually very small,
and if you calculate this,

98
00:06:14,991 --> 00:06:19,271
you will find that this is on the order 
of micro-electron-volts.

99
00:06:20,451 --> 00:06:22,091
So, there is one consequence,

100
00:06:22,091 --> 00:06:24,690
we are using non-ionizing 
electromagnetic fields

101
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,710
for magnetic resonance.

102
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,860
So, that' good--that is different 
from the X-ray techniques.

103
00:06:30,515 --> 00:06:36,515
But given that this term here depends 
on the magnitude of the <i>Δ E</i> here--

104
00:06:36,515 --> 00:06:37,717
this enters linearly,

105
00:06:37,717 --> 00:06:41,647
so as we increase the energy difference 
between the energy levels,

106
00:06:41,647 --> 00:06:45,214
we increase the magnetization--
there is also a consequence--

107
00:06:45,214 --> 00:06:47,024
it is insensitive.

108
00:06:47,024 --> 00:06:49,243
So the following statement
is certainly true:

109
00:06:49,243 --> 00:06:51,473
MR, magnetic resonance, is safe--

110
00:06:51,473 --> 00:06:53,803
we are dealing 
with not ionizing radiation--

111
00:06:53,803 --> 00:06:55,643
but it is insensitive.

112
00:06:55,643 --> 00:06:59,644
We cannot imagine to do an MR experiment

113
00:06:59,644 --> 00:07:01,984
with concentrations 
on the order of picomolar--

114
00:07:01,984 --> 00:07:04,222
there are just not enough molecules there

115
00:07:04,222 --> 00:07:09,122
to produce a measurable 
nuclear magnetization

116
00:07:09,122 --> 00:07:12,352
that we can reasonably detect in the body.

117
00:07:14,299 --> 00:07:18,613
So therefore we would ideally like 
to increase the sensitivity,

118
00:07:18,613 --> 00:07:20,098
and how can we do that?

119
00:07:20,098 --> 00:07:22,233
We have seen just on the previous slide

120
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:26,384
that the equilibrium magnetization
depends on a number of factors

121
00:07:26,384 --> 00:07:29,524
that are given by the nucleus 
and some universal constants,

122
00:07:29,524 --> 00:07:32,624
and temperature, if course, 
which is more or less also given.

123
00:07:33,353 --> 00:07:37,213
So, the only parameter 
that is open for manipulation

124
00:07:37,213 --> 00:07:39,843
is the external magnetic field <i>B_0</i>.

125
00:07:40,313 --> 00:07:41,632
And here is an example

126
00:07:41,632 --> 00:07:46,172
of comparing a scan of the lower abdomen 
at 0.2 Tesla and 1.5 Tesla.

127
00:07:46,652 --> 00:07:49,012
If you look here, the image is grainy,

128
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:52,562
and it gets much sharper 
here, at 1.5 Tesla.

129
00:07:53,394 --> 00:07:58,094
If we take the spine here,
we have, again, 0.2 Tesla here--

130
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:03,344
grainy image--we see very nice details,
but a very crisp image at 1.5 Tesla.

131
00:08:04,078 --> 00:08:10,688
So, comparing the image, the sensitivity 
at lower field and higher field,

132
00:08:10,688 --> 00:08:14,548
we notice a clear improvement 
in sensitivity.

133
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:17,469
Here is another example--
that is brain function--

134
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:20,905
it's functional imaging--
we will discuss that in Lecture 12.

135
00:08:20,905 --> 00:08:23,925
This is a comparison of 1.5 with 4 Tesla--

136
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:27,597
clearly, the sensitivity 
increases substantially

137
00:08:27,597 --> 00:08:29,277
with higher magnetic field.

138
00:08:30,117 --> 00:08:33,847
Here we have an example 
of MRI of the breast.

139
00:08:35,742 --> 00:08:37,952
This is a standard MRI.

140
00:08:37,952 --> 00:08:40,472
We are seeing something here 
that is suspicious.

141
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:44,473
It's a bit clearer here, 
but this is a standard breast image,

142
00:08:44,473 --> 00:08:47,513
and here is a breast image 
with the fat signal removed--

143
00:08:47,513 --> 00:08:51,783
we will discuss that in two weeks, 
how this is removed--

144
00:08:51,783 --> 00:08:55,783
and then one can see clearly 
at 3 Tesla here compared to 1.5 Tesla.

145
00:08:55,787 --> 00:09:01,667
One can clearly see 
the potentially neoplastic lesion here,

146
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:04,128
because the signal is not related to fat,

147
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:11,148
so clearly an improvement in specificity 
with the higher magnetic field.

148
00:09:12,049 --> 00:09:16,709
Now, one thing that we need to remember 
for this course, this week and so on,

149
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:21,229
the theoretically 
maximum possible MR signal

150
00:09:21,229 --> 00:09:28,019
is dictated by the equilibrium 
nuclear magnetization <i>M_0</i>.

151
00:09:28,487 --> 00:09:31,367
This is a given of the system.

152
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:33,207
We cannot go beyond that.

153
00:09:33,611 --> 00:09:38,231
So, any mechanism to generate contrast 
results in a reduction in magnetization.

154
00:09:38,239 --> 00:09:41,429
We will discuss in the weeks to come 
how this happens.

155
00:09:42,597 --> 00:09:48,667
So, we are limited by the thermodynamic 
equilibrium nuclear magnetization <i>M_0</i>

156
00:09:48,667 --> 00:09:53,457
in our sensitivity
that gives us a maximum signal

157
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:54,971
that is possible.
