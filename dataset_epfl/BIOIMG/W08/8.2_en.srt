1
00:00:04,385 --> 00:00:08,701
So the question that now arises 
is how is nuclear magnetism generated?

2
00:00:08,701 --> 00:00:10,714
What is its basis?

3
00:00:10,714 --> 00:00:13,417
And we will here 
talk about the classical view,

4
00:00:13,417 --> 00:00:17,064
more on a classical view 
than the strict quantum-mechanical view

5
00:00:17,064 --> 00:00:22,295
but I will make some references to 
the underlying quantum-mechanical theory.

6
00:00:23,065 --> 00:00:25,092
Now it is known from nuclear physics

7
00:00:25,092 --> 00:00:28,282
that a nucleus typically has 
an angular momentum,

8
00:00:28,282 --> 00:00:30,387
which we know from our physics classes

9
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:33,237
is denoted <i>L</i> but here it is called <i>P.</i>

10
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:36,733
So we can envisage 
we have the nucleus here

11
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:39,294
and the nucleus has an angular momentum.

12
00:00:39,714 --> 00:00:42,371
Now we have with an angular momentum,
classically--

13
00:00:42,371 --> 00:00:46,637
now we'll take here the classical view--
classically we associate

14
00:00:46,637 --> 00:00:49,361
with an angular momentum 
a rotating motion.

15
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:53,437
So we have a rotating motion
and we'll stick with the classical view

16
00:00:53,437 --> 00:00:58,358
because this gives us an intuitive feeling
where the magnetism comes from.

17
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:03,167
So if we feel like in the description
that the nucleus is rotating,

18
00:01:03,167 --> 00:01:05,386
since the nucleus is positively charged,

19
00:01:05,386 --> 00:01:09,219
there is a rotation 
of the electrical charge.

20
00:01:09,219 --> 00:01:12,999
As you can imagine, it's like the earth--
it's positively charged, it's rotating

21
00:01:12,999 --> 00:01:17,888
so at the equator the charge is moving
and moving charge implies a current.

22
00:01:20,018 --> 00:01:25,102
So here is the angular momentum

23
00:01:25,102 --> 00:01:27,992
and since we have a rotating current--

24
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:29,352
here's the rotating current--

25
00:01:29,352 --> 00:01:32,181
so we'll associate this 
with a rotating current

26
00:01:32,181 --> 00:01:38,685
and such a rotating current 
now is associated with a dipole moment.

27
00:01:38,685 --> 00:01:41,831
It's just like a current. 
This is again the classical picture.

28
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:44,235
It's not perfect 
but it helps us understand

29
00:01:44,235 --> 00:01:47,149
where nuclear magnetism comes from.

30
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:50,248
So we'll associate it 
just like with a ring current

31
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:55,054
with a dipole moment <i>mu</i>
that we'll call <i>mu</i> here.

32
00:01:55,694 --> 00:01:58,067
Now in terms of magnetism

33
00:01:58,067 --> 00:02:03,619
we can picture the nucleus 
as if it was a bar magnet.

34
00:02:03,619 --> 00:02:07,382
The magnetism of the nucleus 
acts as if it is a bar magnet.

35
00:02:07,382 --> 00:02:09,569
It's not a bar magnet per se

36
00:02:09,569 --> 00:02:13,238
but it acts electromagnetically
like a bar magnet.

37
00:02:13,238 --> 00:02:18,032
It has a dipole magnetic field 
associated with it.

38
00:02:19,492 --> 00:02:26,293
So that's the intuitive reason 
why with some nuclei

39
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:29,061
we have an angular momentum.
Once we have an angular momentum

40
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:32,318
we have with it associated 
a dipole moment.

41
00:02:33,338 --> 00:02:36,507
Now if we look at a magnetic moment

42
00:02:36,507 --> 00:02:41,881
of an individual spin in a induction field

43
00:02:41,881 --> 00:02:48,064
so this dipole moment, 
this magnetic moment is given by <i>mu,</i>

44
00:02:48,064 --> 00:02:53,869
is equal to <i>gamma </i>
times the angular momentum.

45
00:02:53,869 --> 00:02:56,702
<i>Gamma</i> here is called 
the <i>gyromagnetic ratio,</i>

46
00:02:56,702 --> 00:03:01,083
it's an empircal constant.
There's a more profound theory behind it

47
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:06,093
on what dictates the gyromagnetic ratio
for a given nucleus,

48
00:03:06,093 --> 00:03:08,935
but for our intents and purposes

49
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:13,077
it suffices to say that 
this is an empirical constant.

50
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:16,003
Now what we know from quantum mechanics

51
00:03:16,003 --> 00:03:19,485
is that the angular momentum
of a nucleus is quantized.

52
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:26,604
So it has, for the z component 
of the angular momentum,

53
00:03:26,604 --> 00:03:33,252
it has 2I + 1 values 
and they take on the values <i>m-i.</i>

54
00:03:33,252 --> 00:03:39,963
So here is, for example, where <i>i</i> can go
from minus the angular momentum--

55
00:03:39,963 --> 00:03:43,163
the z component,
the quantum number <i>m</i> here--

56
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:47,944
can go from minus <i>i</i> to plus <i>i</i>
and increments in values of 1.

57
00:03:47,944 --> 00:03:52,793
So here, in this particular example,
we go from minus 3/2 to minus 1/2

58
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:59,867
plus 1/2 plus 3/2, that's the z component
of the angular momentum.

59
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:04,105
We can calculate 
the total angular momentum

60
00:04:04,105 --> 00:04:08,823
and this is given by this equation here.
So it's the quantum number,

61
00:04:08,823 --> 00:04:15,124
the angular momentum number here <i>i</i>
times <i>i + 1</i> times <i>h</i> over <i>2 pi.</i>

62
00:04:16,344 --> 00:04:18,525
So if we take this for a spin 1/2,

63
00:04:18,525 --> 00:04:23,842
so the spin 1/2 can take the values
1/2 and minus 1/2 the angular momentum.

64
00:04:23,842 --> 00:04:27,638
In this case, the total angular momentum
is times the Boltzmann constant

65
00:04:27,638 --> 00:04:29,921
times square root of 3/4 pi

66
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:34,102
that we can verify 
by putting here into <i>i:</i> 1/2.

67
00:04:34,102 --> 00:04:36,772
So that's for a spin 1/2.

68
00:04:38,972 --> 00:04:44,293
So let's look at some isotopes
and the gyromagnetic ratio <i>gamma.</i>

69
00:04:44,293 --> 00:04:47,145
And first we want to introduce
some isotopes that do not carry

70
00:04:47,145 --> 00:04:48,935
an angular momentum.

71
00:04:48,935 --> 00:04:52,650
Those are carbon-12, oxygen-16, et cetera.

72
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:55,600
They have typically even mass
and even atomic number.

73
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,206
So they don't carry a nuclear spin,

74
00:04:57,206 --> 00:05:00,095
they don't carry 
a nuclear angular momentum.

75
00:05:00,095 --> 00:05:02,729
Then we have nuclei with spin 1/2.

76
00:05:02,729 --> 00:05:09,465
These are the proton, 
the hydrogen nucleus H-1, C-15,

77
00:05:09,465 --> 00:05:13,523
and nitrogen-15. 
Another one is phosphorus-31.

78
00:05:13,933 --> 00:05:18,048
They are characterized by a spherical 
discharged distribution in the nucleus.

79
00:05:18,698 --> 00:05:23,305
And then we have the spins 
that are larger than spin 1/2.

80
00:05:24,005 --> 00:05:26,876
Deuterium is an example, boron-11,

81
00:05:26,876 --> 00:05:32,324
sodium-23, lithium-6 is another one,
lithium-7, et cetera.

82
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:38,680
Depending on whether they have
odd or even mass

83
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,200
and an odd atomic number

84
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:44,202
they carry either half integers--
so they're 3/2, 5/2, et cetera--

85
00:05:44,202 --> 00:05:48,944
or a whole integer, 
their spin 1, 2, 3, et cetera.

86
00:05:48,944 --> 00:05:51,101
What's particular about these nuclei

87
00:05:51,101 --> 00:05:55,089
is that they have
an ellipsoidal charge distribution.

88
00:05:55,089 --> 00:05:59,155
They generate within the nucleus
in a electric field

89
00:05:59,155 --> 00:06:01,999
and it's a so-called 
<i>quadripolar electrical field.</i>

90
00:06:01,999 --> 00:06:07,517
They have distinct different properties
typically than the spin 1/2.

91
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:11,018
Now let's look at some examples here.

92
00:06:11,018 --> 00:06:13,515
So we have the isotope listed.

93
00:06:13,515 --> 00:06:16,373
We have the spin, 
whether it's spin 1/2 et cetera.

94
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:18,151
The gyromagnetic ratio.

95
00:06:18,151 --> 00:06:21,229
And here we list the gyromagnetic ratio 
not as the gyromagnetic ratio

96
00:06:21,229 --> 00:06:24,897
but we divide it by <i>2 pi</i>
so this gives us a number

97
00:06:24,897 --> 00:06:30,106
that relates the Larmor frequency to the--

98
00:06:30,106 --> 00:06:34,036
that relates the frequency to the teslas.

99
00:06:34,036 --> 00:06:36,416
And finally we have the abundance.

100
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,407
So what do we see here?
We have hydrogen spin 1/2,

101
00:06:39,407 --> 00:06:42,914
gyromagnetic ratio is 42 MHz/T

102
00:06:42,914 --> 00:06:47,451
and it's basically 
every hydrogen atom is a H1.

103
00:06:47,451 --> 00:06:51,793
Then we have deuterium, this has a spin 1
so it's a quadripolar nucleus,

104
00:06:51,793 --> 00:06:57,577
very low gyromagnetic ratio 
and the abundance is about 0.01%.

105
00:06:57,577 --> 00:07:04,386
Phosphorus-31 is a spin 1/2,
gyromagnetic ratio is about 40% of that

106
00:07:04,386 --> 00:07:08,442
of the hydrogen--of the proton--
and the abundance is 100%.

107
00:07:08,442 --> 00:07:14,098
Sodium: 100% natural abundance here.
It's a spin 3/2

108
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:16,172
and the gyromagnetic ratio is roughly

109
00:07:16,172 --> 00:07:21,008
a fourth of what the same holds 
for carbon-13,

110
00:07:21,008 --> 00:07:24,310
but the abundance for carbon-13 is 1.1%.

111
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,757
And fluorine-19 is almost the same
gyromagnetic ratio as protons

112
00:07:29,757 --> 00:07:32,311
and the abundance is also very high,

113
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:36,727
we just don't have a lot of fluorine
in our bodies.

114
00:07:37,373 --> 00:07:40,292
Now for reasons of the abundance
and the presence

115
00:07:40,292 --> 00:07:44,464
we will be mostly concentrating 
this course on considering

116
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:51,082
the hydrogen nucleus--that is the proton--
as the source of the MR signal.

117
00:07:51,082 --> 00:07:53,912
And for all intents and purposes
suffice it to know

118
00:07:53,912 --> 00:07:57,619
that there are the nuclei around,
how to understand them

119
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:00,660
but most of what we are going to deal with

120
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:05,777
is focusing on the hydrogen nucleus,
that is the proton.

121
00:08:05,777 --> 00:08:09,171
It has spin 1/2.
It has a high gyromagnetic ratio,

122
00:08:09,171 --> 00:08:12,212
and we'll see shortly
why this is important.

123
00:08:12,212 --> 00:08:13,842
And what's also important,

124
00:08:13,842 --> 00:08:17,656
it is present in our bodies 
in raw abundance.

125
00:08:19,366 --> 00:08:24,045
So far I've explained that some nuclei
carry an angular momentum,

126
00:08:24,045 --> 00:08:26,376
they therefore carry a magnetic moment

127
00:08:26,376 --> 00:08:30,703
but now how does this generate
a macroscopic nuclear magnetization?

128
00:08:30,703 --> 00:08:33,968
And that's the question 
we're going to address here.

129
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:37,159
So let's look at the energy 
of a magnetic dipole

130
00:08:37,159 --> 00:08:41,382
in an external magnetic field

131
00:08:41,382 --> 00:08:44,199
and we'll stick here 
to the classical description.

132
00:08:44,199 --> 00:08:48,299
The energy is given by the scalar product

133
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:51,772
of the dipole moment 
with the external magnetic field.

134
00:08:52,172 --> 00:08:57,355
And it is given by <i>mu</i> times <i>cosine--</i>
that's because of the scalar product--

135
00:08:57,355 --> 00:09:00,303
or if we say <i>mu cosine</i>
that is the z component

136
00:09:00,303 --> 00:09:04,210
of the dipole moment times <i>B-0.</i>

137
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,015
That is the energy of a magnetic dipole.

138
00:09:08,615 --> 00:09:13,430
Now this energy is minimal 
when the magnetic dipole

139
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,702
is aligned with the magnetic field.

140
00:09:16,352 --> 00:09:18,207
That is actually used.

141
00:09:20,007 --> 00:09:22,957
Where is that used? Or where was it used?

142
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:26,581
Well think about Christopher Columbus,

143
00:09:26,581 --> 00:09:28,850
he needed to know where the North Pole is

144
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:32,958
so he had to use a way to identify
the magnetic North Pole

145
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:36,546
and this was done with magnetized needles
orienting in a liquid

146
00:09:36,546 --> 00:09:39,201
parallel to the earth's magnetic field.

147
00:09:39,201 --> 00:09:41,579
So that was used in navigation.

148
00:09:42,429 --> 00:09:47,353
Now what's behind this 
is that a dipole will align itself

149
00:09:47,353 --> 00:09:49,122
to find the minimal energy

150
00:09:49,122 --> 00:09:54,622
and there's a torque exerted on the dipole

151
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:59,248
that is given by the magnetic dipole,
is vector product of magnetic dipole

152
00:09:59,248 --> 00:10:01,657
with the external magnetic field.

153
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:07,217
So let's just demonstrate this 
in the following experiment

154
00:10:09,307 --> 00:10:13,367
where we will demonstrate the force 
of the external magnetic field

155
00:10:13,367 --> 00:10:17,140
on the dipole with a magnetic dipole.

156
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:26,153
As mentioned in the course, the energy 
of a magnetic moment in atomic--

157
00:10:26,153 --> 00:10:29,215
a nuclear magnetic moment
in an external magnetic field

158
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:33,576
is not dissimilar to what happens
with a macroscopic magnet

159
00:10:33,576 --> 00:10:35,298
in external magnetic field.

160
00:10:35,298 --> 00:10:37,798
And I want to illustrate this 
with this experiment here.

161
00:10:37,798 --> 00:10:42,151
We have a magnet here which can rotate,
so it can freely rotate.

162
00:10:42,151 --> 00:10:45,311
Here is a--it's attached here 
to show the torque.

163
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:46,782
And here we have two electromagnets.

164
00:10:46,782 --> 00:10:49,506
These two electromagnets 
will develop the magnetic field

165
00:10:49,506 --> 00:10:52,769
when I turn them on.
So right now there is no force on this.

166
00:10:52,769 --> 00:10:54,653
The magnet is like this.

167
00:10:54,653 --> 00:10:57,894
And when I now turn on the magnetic field,

168
00:10:57,894 --> 00:11:00,976
you can see that the magnet 
tries to align itself.

169
00:11:00,976 --> 00:11:03,390
If we didn't have here this force meter,

170
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:07,161
it would align itself perfectly 
with the magnetic field.

171
00:11:07,161 --> 00:11:10,547
If I reverse the polarity 
of the magnetic field,

172
00:11:10,547 --> 00:11:14,042
the motion is in the other direction
in this sense.

173
00:11:15,322 --> 00:11:19,749
I can see if I can illustrate this

174
00:11:19,749 --> 00:11:23,019
if I loosen this,

175
00:11:23,439 --> 00:11:25,957
then now here you can see 
the perfect alignment if I don't have

176
00:11:25,957 --> 00:11:29,920
the force attached to it
which is meant here to illustrate

177
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,945
the development of the force.

178
00:11:31,945 --> 00:11:36,240
So like a macroscopic magnet
in a magnetic field,

179
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,810
nuclear magnetic moments have a tendency
to align themselves

180
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:43,089
in one direction or the other
and their energy that they have

181
00:11:43,089 --> 00:11:46,858
in the magnetic field 
depends on their orientation

182
00:11:46,858 --> 00:11:51,910
but the minimum is found when the moment 
is as much aligned as possible

183
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,523
with the magnetic field.

184
00:11:54,971 --> 00:11:59,109
Okay, now we have stated the energy
as a function of the z component

185
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:01,708
of the magnetic moment.

186
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:04,768
So it's this term here--<i>mu-z</i> times <i>B-0.</i>

187
00:12:04,768 --> 00:12:07,738
So we will now look at 
the quantum mechanical description

188
00:12:07,738 --> 00:12:11,004
and we know that the z component 
of the angular momentum

189
00:12:11,004 --> 00:12:14,435
therefore of the magnetic dipole 
is quantized,

190
00:12:14,435 --> 00:12:17,766
has discrete values 
and it's given by this expression.

191
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:20,022
This is the gyromagnetic ratio

192
00:12:20,022 --> 00:12:21,906
and these are the terms 
that we have introduced

193
00:12:21,906 --> 00:12:26,321
for the angular momentum
just in the previous slide.

194
00:12:26,321 --> 00:12:32,003
So we have energies that depend on
the level of the z component

195
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:35,989
of the magnetic moment 
that is the angular momentum.

196
00:12:35,989 --> 00:12:38,979
Again, <i>m-i</i> can go from minus <i>i</i> to plus <i>i.</i>

197
00:12:38,979 --> 00:12:43,045
For a spin 1/2 it's minus 1/2 to plus 1/2.

198
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:49,004
So if we said for spin 1/2
we'll take the energy level below

199
00:12:49,004 --> 00:12:53,160
so that is minus <i>gamma, 
h</i> over <i>4 pi</i> times <i>B-0</i>

200
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,021
here's the energy level.

201
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:57,716
This is for the <i>m</i> of 1/2

202
00:12:57,716 --> 00:13:01,476
and we'll say that our <i>m2</i>
spins in that energy level.

203
00:13:01,476 --> 00:13:06,653
Then we have the higher energy level,
that's where the dipole is opposite--

204
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:10,162
in opposite orientation--
here the energy is now positive.

205
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:12,974
It's spin 1/2 so it's plus minus 1/2.

206
00:13:12,974 --> 00:13:16,278
The calculation's given 
so <i>m</i> equals minus 1/2.

207
00:13:16,278 --> 00:13:18,847
You can verify this 
with this equation here.

208
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:22,456
And we'll say we have <i>m1</i> spins 
in that energy level.

209
00:13:23,546 --> 00:13:25,783
We now have an energy difference.

210
00:13:25,783 --> 00:13:31,651
Whether the nucleus it spins 
pointing upwards or downwards,

211
00:13:31,651 --> 00:13:34,088
it has an energy difference
depending on its orientation

212
00:13:34,088 --> 00:13:39,171
that is given by the gyromagnetic ratio
times Boltzmann constant divided by <i>2 pi</i>

213
00:13:39,171 --> 00:13:42,360
times the magnetic field <i>B-0.</i>

214
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:46,986
Now we know from Boltzmann statistics
or a Boltzmann distribution,

215
00:13:46,986 --> 00:13:52,268
we know that we are going to get
an unequal population of energy levels.

216
00:13:53,058 --> 00:13:56,613
This is dictated 
by Boltzmann distribution.

217
00:13:56,613 --> 00:13:59,012
And the relationship between 
the number of spins

218
00:13:59,012 --> 00:14:01,903
in the higher energy level--that is <i>N1--</i>

219
00:14:01,903 --> 00:14:08,146
to the number of nuclei 
in the lower energy level,

220
00:14:08,146 --> 00:14:11,376
this relationship is given 
by <i>e</i> to the minus

221
00:14:11,376 --> 00:14:15,877
the energy difference divided by 
the thermal energy, which is <i>kT.</i>

222
00:14:16,537 --> 00:14:19,673
<i>K</i> is the Boltzmann constant, 
here is its value given.

223
00:14:19,673 --> 00:14:21,572
It's not really important.

224
00:14:21,572 --> 00:14:23,724
But what is important 
if you look at this ratio,

225
00:14:23,724 --> 00:14:25,660
and you do the math, you plug this in,

226
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:28,892
you calculate the <i>delta E</i> divide it by <i>kT,</i>

227
00:14:28,892 --> 00:14:32,663
at 310 kelvin--which is roughly 
our body temperature--

228
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:36,590
you'll find that at a field of 1 Tesla,
if we look at the proton spins

229
00:14:36,590 --> 00:14:41,864
so we take the gyromagnetic ratio
of the hydrogen-1 nucleus--the proton--

230
00:14:41,864 --> 00:14:45,985
then you find that 
for every million protons

231
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:49,044
in the higher energy level 
there's a million protons,

232
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:51,938
a million and one proton 
in the lower energy level.

233
00:14:51,938 --> 00:14:56,208
That makes a difference,
an excess in difference

234
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:59,949
between the two energy levels
of one out of a million.

235
00:15:00,829 --> 00:15:03,105
So basically, as a rough approximation,

236
00:15:03,105 --> 00:15:07,167
we can say <i>N1</i> is the number of spins
in the upper energy level

237
00:15:08,497 --> 00:15:13,014
is almost equal to the number of spins
in the lower energy level

238
00:15:13,014 --> 00:15:18,602
where N--and we'll call this N/2--
where N is the total number of spins

239
00:15:18,602 --> 00:15:23,610
or hydrogen nuclei present in our voxel.

240
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,623
So this is the Boltzmann distribution.

241
00:15:27,623 --> 00:15:30,661
Now if you look at the situation here,

242
00:15:30,661 --> 00:15:33,270
if we are now looking at 
the distribution of the spins

243
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,690
we have them all in the lower energy level

244
00:15:35,690 --> 00:15:38,132
and none in the higher energy level.

245
00:15:38,132 --> 00:15:41,047
Is such a state even possible?

246
00:15:42,327 --> 00:15:43,825
Well, in theory it is.

247
00:15:43,825 --> 00:15:47,685
This basically means 
that N1/N2 goes to zero

248
00:15:47,685 --> 00:15:50,600
and this is if we let 
the temperature go to zero.

249
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:56,413
Then <i>e^-(1/0)</i> becomes <i>e^-(infinity)</i>
that becomes zero.

250
00:15:56,413 --> 00:15:59,903
So if we cool our sample down
to micro- or nanokelvin,

251
00:15:59,903 --> 00:16:03,587
you'll be essentially getting something
at approximative state.

252
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,877
This is the ground state of the system.

253
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:10,186
For us in biomedical imaging, 
this is not very interesting.

254
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:14,947
We cannot really cool down
our subjects for imaging.

255
00:16:14,947 --> 00:16:17,908
So if we raise the temperature 
now gradually,

256
00:16:17,908 --> 00:16:22,380
what we have is that the thermal energy
will bump some of the spins

257
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:24,947
into the higher energy level.

258
00:16:24,947 --> 00:16:27,961
And as we increase the temperature
we have more and more

259
00:16:27,961 --> 00:16:30,735
in the higher energy level.

260
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:34,915
We'll still have a certain difference
in the population

261
00:16:34,915 --> 00:16:39,566
unless we have the temperature
go to infinity, at very high temperatures,

262
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:43,218
then they are truly equalized.
That we can see again here

263
00:16:43,218 --> 00:16:48,233
if the temperature goes to infinity,
this goes to zero, <i>e^-0</i> is equal to 1.

264
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:54,211
So we have this population difference
that is generated

265
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:58,985
between the nuclei
in the higher energy level

266
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,643
and the nuclei in the lower energy level.

267
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:03,499
And this difference is important.

268
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:06,596
Before we go on though,
I want to make the point here

269
00:17:06,596 --> 00:17:11,176
that we have also these transitions
between the energy levels

270
00:17:11,176 --> 00:17:13,240
is induced by photons.

271
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:17,670
Photon is the interaction boson
for electrodynamics.

272
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:21,591
So we can associate 
this energy difference here to <i>delta E</i>

273
00:17:21,591 --> 00:17:25,523
with a photon in the [<i>h mu</i>]
and then we can look this up

274
00:17:25,523 --> 00:17:28,660
what this value is, to relate this

275
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:31,653
to the x-ray techniques 
that we have been discussing

276
00:17:31,653 --> 00:17:34,427
in the first half of this course.

277
00:17:34,427 --> 00:17:38,114
And then we can see actually 
that for NMR--nuclear magnetic resonance

278
00:17:38,114 --> 00:17:43,351
or magnetic resonance--we have 
the energies are in this range.

279
00:17:43,351 --> 00:17:47,819
So they are in this wavelength range here.

280
00:17:47,819 --> 00:17:53,786
We are well beyond microwave wavelengths,
so it's a very long wavelength.

281
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:55,390
And what is important here--

282
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:01,457
we are working with non-ionizing radiation
in magnetic resonance.
