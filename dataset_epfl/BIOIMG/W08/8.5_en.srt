1
00:00:04,612 --> 00:00:11,922
Now, we are going to explore the motion
described by the Larmor equation.

2
00:00:12,472 --> 00:00:16,102
And for understanding
the motion of magnetization,

3
00:00:16,102 --> 00:00:20,974
it is important to introduce a concept
on how to simplify

4
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:23,295
the description of the motion--

5
00:00:23,295 --> 00:00:27,695
how to make it more accessible
understanding what exactly happens.

6
00:00:28,255 --> 00:00:35,446
And this simplification is based on
using a rotating reference frame.

7
00:00:36,146 --> 00:00:38,296
And why do we want to do this?

8
00:00:38,296 --> 00:00:43,296
Well, first I want to go and explain
what is a rotating reference frame.

9
00:00:43,296 --> 00:00:48,538
A rotating reference frame is a frame
that rotates about the <i>z</i> axis

10
00:00:48,538 --> 00:00:50,829
in the laboratory frame-- 
so that's our reference frame

11
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,579
will rotate around the <i>z</i> axis--

12
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:55,988
we'll assume the magnetic field
is vertical in this case.

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,990
So why would we use
a rotating reference frame?

14
00:00:59,990 --> 00:01:03,582
We've seen that the equation of motion,
the Larmor equation,

15
00:01:03,582 --> 00:01:07,112
gives us a rotation
around the magnetic field.

16
00:01:07,112 --> 00:01:11,213
So if we have a magnetization that is not
parallel to the magnetic field,

17
00:01:11,213 --> 00:01:14,013
then it will rotate around
that magnetic field

18
00:01:14,013 --> 00:01:18,935
just like the bicycle wheel
that we have seen rotating.

19
00:01:21,555 --> 00:01:24,735
This is similar to a carousel--

20
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:28,385
so we are on a carousel,
and if we look at a carousel,

21
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:32,616
the motion of people on the carousel
from the outside--

22
00:01:32,616 --> 00:01:35,756
it's fairly complicated because we have
any motion on the carousel

23
00:01:35,756 --> 00:01:39,699
superimposed by
the motion of the carousel itself.

24
00:01:39,699 --> 00:01:42,046
That's what we see from the outside.

25
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,479
And if we now put ourselves
on the reference frame on the carousel

26
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,449
anything that happens on the carousel
with respect to the carousel

27
00:01:49,449 --> 00:01:51,169
is stationary.

28
00:01:52,019 --> 00:01:55,580
What we do in classical physics,
I'll do the analogy here,

29
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:57,742
is that we are sitting--
let's say we are sitting

30
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:01,528
on a chair without motion,

31
00:02:02,327 --> 00:02:05,721
then we have a force,
that's the centripetal force

32
00:02:05,721 --> 00:02:08,441
towards the center--
that's the force of the chair

33
00:02:08,441 --> 00:02:12,087
that pushes us and maintains
the circular motion that we have.

34
00:02:12,087 --> 00:02:14,804
But we feel from our inertia
that there is a force

35
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:17,195
that pushes out against the chair.

36
00:02:17,195 --> 00:02:19,064
This is not a physical force,

37
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:23,205
it's purely the inertia that
our visual system senses;

38
00:02:23,205 --> 00:02:25,066
it is a fictitious force.

39
00:02:27,249 --> 00:02:33,697
So we have, similarly
to the motion on the carousel,

40
00:02:33,697 --> 00:02:37,278
we have the magnetization vector
here it turns here in the lab frame,

41
00:02:37,278 --> 00:02:42,269
and if we are in the rotating frame,
the magnetization vector is stationary.

42
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:45,309
So we can, just like in the carousel,
if we have our magnetization

43
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:48,819
that is precessing
around the magnetic field <i>B zero</i>,

44
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:51,291
we can put ourselves
into a reference frame

45
00:02:51,291 --> 00:02:54,771
that rotates with the magnetization

46
00:02:54,771 --> 00:02:56,902
and there the magnetization
becomes stationary,

47
00:02:56,902 --> 00:02:59,565
just like the person here on the carousel.

48
00:03:01,342 --> 00:03:04,612
So what are the consequences
of using a rotating reference frame?

49
00:03:04,612 --> 00:03:08,154
I'll start here with making
the analogy to classical physics.

50
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:12,174
In this video you see kids
throwing a ball at each other,

51
00:03:12,174 --> 00:03:14,175
first seen with a camera from above--

52
00:03:14,175 --> 00:03:16,263
the ball goes pretty much
in a straight line--

53
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:18,863
and then when the camera
is put on the merry-go-round

54
00:03:18,863 --> 00:03:22,327
you see that the ball
goes in a very curved motion

55
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:25,376
which seems odd.

56
00:03:25,376 --> 00:03:30,034
I will show in the following,
with an animation, this effect.

57
00:03:30,677 --> 00:03:32,888
And basically the situation
we're considering here

58
00:03:32,888 --> 00:03:34,587
is that we have a pendulum

59
00:03:34,587 --> 00:03:38,799
that swings with an amplitude
equal to the disk radius

60
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,419
and a period that's equal to
that of the disk that rotates below.

61
00:03:42,419 --> 00:03:46,010
So here's the disk. The triangle indicates
the motion of the disk.

62
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,851
Now we have the pendulum swinging--

63
00:03:48,851 --> 00:03:51,977
its period is exactly
to the period of the disk.

64
00:03:52,731 --> 00:03:56,161
That's the equivalent
of the merry-go-round.

65
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:59,213
So we're throwing
the pendulum in a straight line--

66
00:03:59,213 --> 00:04:02,743
this is the bird's-eye view,
it's in the inertial reference frame,

67
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:06,382
everything is the way we normally see it.

68
00:04:06,863 --> 00:04:09,564
Now what we're going to do
is we're going to put ourselves

69
00:04:09,564 --> 00:04:12,964
into the rotating reference frame
of the carousel.

70
00:04:12,964 --> 00:04:15,055
And to help your eyes see the motion

71
00:04:15,055 --> 00:04:18,065
I have indicated here
the coordinate system

72
00:04:18,065 --> 00:04:20,195
by the spokes on the carousel.

73
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:24,726
We'll take away the motion
seen from the outside

74
00:04:24,726 --> 00:04:26,097
and now train your eye--

75
00:04:26,097 --> 00:04:30,227
do you see what motion you see
with respect to a carousel?

76
00:04:31,507 --> 00:04:34,909
Here it is.
So it is indeed a circular motion.

77
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:39,748
Our object, seen from the carousel,
undergoes circular motion.

78
00:04:41,878 --> 00:04:46,741
And just to convince you
that I'm not cheating here in any way,

79
00:04:46,741 --> 00:04:48,701
I'll put back the horizontal line--

80
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:52,781
so seen from the outside,
we still see the motion

81
00:04:52,781 --> 00:04:54,734
of the object of the pendulum

82
00:04:54,734 --> 00:04:56,972
swinging back and forth
in a straight line.

83
00:04:56,972 --> 00:05:00,794
But from the carousel--
seen from the carousel,

84
00:05:00,794 --> 00:05:05,111
from the merry-go-round--
we see it as circular motion.

85
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:09,285
So that's essentially
the motion that is seen

86
00:05:09,285 --> 00:05:11,555
if our reference frame
that describes our motion

87
00:05:11,555 --> 00:05:13,305
is equal to that of the merry-go-round,

88
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:17,140
the carousel,
or the rotating reference frame.

89
00:05:18,495 --> 00:05:22,351
Now what we have done here is
we have just changed

90
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:25,812
the mathematical framework
on describing the motion.

91
00:05:26,278 --> 00:05:28,148
We go from straight motion
to circular motion

92
00:05:28,148 --> 00:05:30,208
depending on whether
we describe the motion

93
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:32,649
in a reference frame that rotates.

94
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:36,661
That's a purely mathematical description
of the motion.

95
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:40,900
And we still want to have
a proper description of the motion,

96
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,211
and to do that we want to look
at the motion in our merry-go-round--

97
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:50,622
we want to add all the forces
that act on our ball, or on our object--

98
00:05:52,042 --> 00:05:56,053
and in the end we still want to have
a proper calculation of the acceleration--

99
00:05:56,053 --> 00:05:57,813
that's Newton's second law.

100
00:05:57,813 --> 00:06:00,933
So to get to the proper
acceleration here--

101
00:06:00,933 --> 00:06:04,844
to describe this motion here,
to get the proper acceleration--

102
00:06:04,844 --> 00:06:07,855
we have to add two fictitious forces:

103
00:06:07,855 --> 00:06:11,116
centrifugal force and the Coriolis force.

104
00:06:11,116 --> 00:06:15,608
Now bear in mind, those two forces
have nothing to do with physics, as such.

105
00:06:16,227 --> 00:06:20,438
They are the consequence of the fact
that we mathematically change

106
00:06:20,438 --> 00:06:26,699
our reference frame
from an inertial frame--

107
00:06:26,699 --> 00:06:28,980
that's a typical non-moving
reference frame--

108
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:32,090
to one that rotates around the axis <i>z</i>.

109
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,941
These forces have to be added

110
00:06:33,941 --> 00:06:37,889
so that we can describe
in the reference frame that rotates--

111
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:39,432
this one here--

112
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:43,372
that we can still arrive at
calculating the proper accelerations

113
00:06:43,372 --> 00:06:45,373
with Newton's second law.

114
00:06:47,343 --> 00:06:51,594
Now you might ask why am I transgressing
into classical physics--

115
00:06:52,334 --> 00:06:55,537
what is the link to magnetic resonance?

116
00:06:55,537 --> 00:06:57,654
Actually the link is there.

117
00:06:57,654 --> 00:07:03,376
We have a mathematical description
in a reference frame that rotates.

118
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:05,007
In classical physics,

119
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:08,906
we need to subtract
or add two fictitious forces

120
00:07:08,906 --> 00:07:12,667
and, as you will see in the next slide,

121
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:16,218
we have to do a similar thing
for the proper description

122
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:20,309
of the magnetization
in the rotating reference frame.

123
00:07:20,309 --> 00:07:22,779
Except that we're not
going to deal with forces.

124
00:07:22,779 --> 00:07:25,430
We are rotating
in the rotating reference frame,

125
00:07:25,430 --> 00:07:27,860
not in a physical reference frame;

126
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:30,910
it's a reference frame
linked to the magnetization.

127
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,071
So how does the equation of motion
for the magnetization change

128
00:07:36,071 --> 00:07:38,628
if we change the reference frame?

129
00:07:39,695 --> 00:07:43,113
So we'll now say, we're going to
put ourselves into a reference frame

130
00:07:43,113 --> 00:07:46,333
that rotates with <i>omega_RF</i>--
that's in radians per second.

131
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,633
And in that reference frame

132
00:07:49,633 --> 00:07:53,605
we observe the magnetization
rotating with a Larmor frequency,

133
00:07:53,605 --> 00:07:58,126
<i>a big omega</i> here which is given by
the Larmor frequency <i>gamma B zero</i>

134
00:07:58,126 --> 00:08:01,025
minus this <i>omega_RF</i>--

135
00:08:01,025 --> 00:08:06,867
that's the angular velocity
of the rotating reference frame.

136
00:08:09,037 --> 00:08:11,749
We can now associate to this <i>omega</i>--

137
00:08:11,749 --> 00:08:17,699
this observed Larmor frequency,
[inaudible] can observe--

138
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,459
we can relate this to a magnetic field

139
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:22,089
and we'll call this magnetic field
<i>delta B</i>.

140
00:08:22,089 --> 00:08:26,911
So <i>big omega</i> is equal to <i>gamma delta B</i>.

141
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:36,303
Or, if we now stick this in here,
and we use <i>omega_L</i> equals <i>gamma B_zero</i>,

142
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:39,734
the <i>delta B</i> is given by <i>B_zero</i>--
the external magnetic field--

143
00:08:39,734 --> 00:08:43,264
minus <i>omega</i> of the rotating frame
divided by <i>gamma</i>.

144
00:08:49,424 --> 00:08:53,187
In the lab frame,
where our rotating frame does not rotate--

145
00:08:53,187 --> 00:08:54,667
that's the lab frame--

146
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:59,697
<i>omega_RF</i> is zero, and the Larmor frequency
that we observe in that reference frame

147
00:08:59,697 --> 00:09:01,378
is equal to <i>omega_L</i>

148
00:09:01,378 --> 00:09:05,127
and <i>delta B</i> is equal to <i>B_0</i>.

149
00:09:05,629 --> 00:09:09,218
So now what we want is,
in our rotating reference frame,

150
00:09:09,218 --> 00:09:13,210
independent of the frequency

151
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:16,350
with which I take
my reference frame to rotate at,

152
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,952
I want the Larmor equation to be true.

153
00:09:19,868 --> 00:09:21,384
For it to be true,

154
00:09:21,384 --> 00:09:27,872
I have to increasingly subtract
a fictitious magnetic field.

155
00:09:27,872 --> 00:09:32,273
And this magnetic field is this term here:
<i>omega_RF</i> over <i>gamma</i>

156
00:09:32,273 --> 00:09:36,034
that we have to subtract from <i>B_0</i>.

157
00:09:36,704 --> 00:09:40,435
So this is not unlike
the classical mechanics

158
00:09:40,435 --> 00:09:44,876
where we take our physical forces;
once we're in the rotating reference frame

159
00:09:44,876 --> 00:09:48,756
we have to add or subtract--
depending on how you look at it--

160
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:52,487
the centrifugal force
and the Coriolis force.

161
00:09:52,487 --> 00:09:56,077
Here, in order for
the equation of motion to work,

162
00:09:56,787 --> 00:10:01,638
we have to subtract
a fictitious magnetic field--

163
00:10:01,638 --> 00:10:03,879
that's a consequence of the motion--

164
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:07,779
to make the equation of motion work;
we still want this equation to be true

165
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:10,960
in any of our reference frames.

166
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,151
So how does this work?

167
00:10:14,151 --> 00:10:18,502
We'll look first at the lab frame.

168
00:10:18,502 --> 00:10:22,933
We are far away from the Larmor frequency
so this is our rotating reference frame--

169
00:10:22,933 --> 00:10:25,712
let's say it is at zero--
here's our Larmor frequency

170
00:10:25,712 --> 00:10:29,234
on the horizontal axis is frequency.

171
00:10:29,234 --> 00:10:34,214
Then this difference in frequency
is given by <i>omega</i> here.

172
00:10:35,934 --> 00:10:39,686
And if we look in this reference frame
at the motion

173
00:10:39,686 --> 00:10:43,996
we have a <i>delta B</i>
which is given by this term here.

174
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:47,267
So if we say <i>omega_RF</i>,
the reference frame frequency is zero,

175
00:10:47,267 --> 00:10:50,282
then the <i>delta B</i> is equal to <i>B_0</i>.

176
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:53,157
Now what is the motion of magnetization
that we observe?

177
00:10:53,157 --> 00:10:54,587
Here's the magnetization--

178
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:57,678
we'll say it is in the transverse plane,
so <i>xy</i>--

179
00:10:57,678 --> 00:10:59,889
and if this magnetization's
a transverse plane

180
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:02,013
then it will precess
at a very high frequency

181
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:07,930
dictated by <i>gamma delta B</i>
around the magnetic field <i>B_0</i>.

182
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:12,091
This is what we call <i>off-resonance</i>.

183
00:11:12,091 --> 00:11:16,762
We're far away with our rotating frame
from the Larmor frequency.

184
00:11:16,762 --> 00:11:19,171
Now let's get a little bit closer.

185
00:11:19,171 --> 00:11:22,652
And we'll go closer
with our rotating frame frequency,

186
00:11:22,652 --> 00:11:25,133
and now the motion is slower--

187
00:11:25,133 --> 00:11:30,134
we're starting to approximate
the Larmor frequency.

188
00:11:30,134 --> 00:11:33,775
This is as if we have first started out
observing a carousel--

189
00:11:33,775 --> 00:11:36,955
it turns, and now we're starting,
with our reference frame,

190
00:11:36,955 --> 00:11:40,065
starting to move in the direction
of the rotation of the carousel.

191
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:41,996
Then the carousel,
from that reference frame,

192
00:11:41,996 --> 00:11:45,657
will turn at a slower frequency

193
00:11:45,657 --> 00:11:48,608
and this is what we see here
with the magnetization.

194
00:11:48,608 --> 00:11:51,758
As we have increased our <i>omega RF</i>--

195
00:11:51,758 --> 00:11:56,319
we have increased this term--
we have to subtract this fictitious field

196
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:58,670
as a consequence
of the rotating reference frame

197
00:11:58,670 --> 00:12:03,270
[it will become] <i>omega RF</i>
divided by <i>gamma</i>.

198
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,071
So our <i>delta B</i> is now reduced.

199
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:08,510
If we go even closer,

200
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:12,082
then we're now relatively close
to the Larmor frequency

201
00:12:12,082 --> 00:12:17,662
the precession will be
noticeably slowed down,

202
00:12:17,662 --> 00:12:21,744
and we have to subtract <i>omega_RF</i>
as it's increased

203
00:12:21,744 --> 00:12:25,594
a bigger fictitious field
<i>omega_RF</i> over <i>gamma</i>,

204
00:12:25,594 --> 00:12:28,615
and the <i>delta B</i> is now decreased
because this motion here

205
00:12:28,615 --> 00:12:32,466
dictates the frequency of precession here.

206
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:36,527
And now if we go essentially
on to the Larmor frequency

207
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:42,147
then our <i>big omega</i> goes to zero,
and our magnetization no longer turns--

208
00:12:42,147 --> 00:12:44,288
I'm still showing
a turning magnetization here,

209
00:12:44,288 --> 00:12:47,138
otherwise it's a very boring animation.

210
00:12:47,138 --> 00:12:51,600
But essentially, if our <i>omega RF</i> is equal
to the Larmor frequency

211
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,920
then our magnetization, we are rotating
exactly at the frequency

212
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,510
with which the magnetization
rotates around <i>B_0</i>

213
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,232
and in that reference frame,
the magnetization is stationary

214
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:04,666
so it does not move.

215
00:13:05,141 --> 00:13:08,063
If the magnetization does not move,

216
00:13:08,063 --> 00:13:11,134
then it is stationary
in that reference frame

217
00:13:11,134 --> 00:13:13,894
so the derivative
for the magnetization with time is zero,

218
00:13:13,894 --> 00:13:15,794
so <i>omega</i> has to be zero,

219
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,685
and that means that <i>omega_RF</i>
is equal to <i>omega_L</i>,

220
00:13:18,685 --> 00:13:20,195
<i>delta B</i> equals zero

221
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:23,196
and this case we call <i>on-resonance</i>

222
00:13:23,196 --> 00:13:26,725
where <i>omega_RF</i>
is equal to the Larmor frequency.

223
00:13:26,725 --> 00:13:29,296
That's the on-resonance situation.

224
00:13:29,296 --> 00:13:31,507
That's the situation
as if you are on the carousel

225
00:13:31,507 --> 00:13:36,118
and now your reference frame is moving
exactly with the motion of the carousel.

226
00:13:37,268 --> 00:13:41,580
And so I want to show this precession
of the magnetization,

227
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:43,313
the Larmor equation,

228
00:13:43,313 --> 00:13:46,849
with a simulated experiment of precession.

229
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:50,651
It's a macroscopic experiment--
it simulates how spin precession works.

230
00:13:50,651 --> 00:13:56,256
We'll just take the view of the lab frame
in this experiment that follows.

231
00:13:58,764 --> 00:14:00,483
This is an experiment

232
00:14:00,483 --> 00:14:05,763
which simulates the motion of precession--

233
00:14:05,763 --> 00:14:08,734
the Larmor equation--
on a macroscopic scale.

234
00:14:08,734 --> 00:14:11,304
We have in this yellow ball,
we have a magnet

235
00:14:11,304 --> 00:14:15,065
and that magnet will align itself
based on the magnetic field.

236
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:19,456
However, it is required that it has--
just like the nuclear spin--

237
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:21,577
that it has an angular momentum.

238
00:14:21,577 --> 00:14:26,757
If I don't have an angular momentum here,
and I turn on the magnetic field,

239
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:28,858
the ball will just go down

240
00:14:28,858 --> 00:14:33,997
as we have seen with the wheel experiment,
the suspended bicycle wheel.

241
00:14:34,398 --> 00:14:38,220
So now what I will try to do is,
I will try to give this ball a spin.

242
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,900
I'll set it into circular motion.

243
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,060
Nothing happens now,
now I turn on the magnetic field

244
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:50,324
and you can see
it is turning around in one way,

245
00:14:51,204 --> 00:14:55,304
and if I stop the magnetic field it stops,
it just turns around its axis,

246
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:57,713
and if I invert the polarity
of the magnetic field

247
00:14:57,713 --> 00:14:59,564
it turns the other direction.

248
00:14:59,564 --> 00:15:02,953
And those are the properties
of the Larmor equation

249
00:15:02,953 --> 00:15:06,067
demonstrated here with this
macroscopic experiment.

250
00:15:07,453 --> 00:15:09,166
We have today, in the course,

251
00:15:09,166 --> 00:15:13,955
talked about that the equilibrium
thermodynamic magnetization is along <i>z</i>.

252
00:15:13,955 --> 00:15:19,431
And we want to look

253
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:24,258
at how we can get the magnetization
to change its orientation.

254
00:15:24,258 --> 00:15:27,148
And this I want to do
for the end of the lecture,

255
00:15:27,148 --> 00:15:30,729
we'll resume this description,

256
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,809
but it's an example
of describing the motion

257
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:37,019
in the rotating reference frame.

258
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:41,757
I want to illustrate how the magnetization
can be manipulated.

259
00:15:42,091 --> 00:15:44,431
So if we're putting ourselves
into a magnet

260
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:48,250
we will develop a thermodynamic
equilibrium magnetization <i>M_0</i>.

261
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:53,793
If we take the reference frame
that rotates with the Larmor frequency,

262
00:15:53,793 --> 00:15:57,524
that's the on-resonance case
as we have described it,

263
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,645
then we have to--
In that reference frame,

264
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:03,414
we have no net magnetic field

265
00:16:03,414 --> 00:16:05,815
so the magnetization is stationary--

266
00:16:05,815 --> 00:16:07,574
we have no <i>B_0</i>,

267
00:16:07,574 --> 00:16:13,079
the <i>omega_RF</i> over <i>gamma</i>
just cancels the <i>B_0</i> term.

268
00:16:14,226 --> 00:16:15,877
Now, in this reference frame,

269
00:16:15,877 --> 00:16:20,177
we will apply an additional
constant magnetic field

270
00:16:20,177 --> 00:16:23,627
with magnitude <i>B_1</i>--
we'll give it the name <i>B_1</i>--

271
00:16:23,627 --> 00:16:28,041
and it shall be somewhere
in the transverse plane along <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>.

272
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,879
It doesn't matter
whether it's along <i>x</i> or <i>y</i>

273
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:33,149
for the purpose of this discussion,

274
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:38,428
and we'll apply this additional
magnetic field <i>B_1</i> for a time <i>tau</i>.

275
00:16:40,171 --> 00:16:41,371
So, question:

276
00:16:41,371 --> 00:16:44,342
What motion can we observe
for the magnetization

277
00:16:44,342 --> 00:16:47,014
in our rotating reference frame?

278
00:16:47,894 --> 00:16:50,323
Well, let's look
at the equation of motion.

279
00:16:50,323 --> 00:16:52,323
We have said it is always the same--

280
00:16:52,323 --> 00:16:56,354
the derivative of the magnetization
is equal to <i>minus gamma</i> the magnetic field

281
00:16:56,354 --> 00:17:01,285
times the magnetization,
and the times here is the vector product.

282
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:04,306
Since we are rotating
in the reference frame

283
00:17:04,306 --> 00:17:06,197
that rotates with the Larmor frequency,

284
00:17:06,197 --> 00:17:09,466
the <i>B_0</i> term does not exist
in the equation

285
00:17:09,466 --> 00:17:12,386
and we've said the <i>B_1</i> here is constant--

286
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:16,448
it is in the transverse plane
so it is perpendicular to <i>B_0</i>.

287
00:17:17,488 --> 00:17:20,548
So what motion can we observe
for the magnetization

288
00:17:20,548 --> 00:17:23,719
if we start out
with equilibrium magnetization?

289
00:17:23,719 --> 00:17:25,499
The motion is the same,

290
00:17:25,499 --> 00:17:28,480
and in this reference frame
the magnetic field is constant,

291
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:31,901
so the motion that we observe--
this is what we've discussed--

292
00:17:31,901 --> 00:17:35,621
this equation says
that the equilibrium magnetization

293
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,751
will now start to precess about <i>B_1</i>.

294
00:17:38,751 --> 00:17:44,313
So it will rotate about the vector <i>B_1</i>
at a constant angular velocity.

295
00:17:45,613 --> 00:17:49,444
So this angular velocity
in radians per second <i>gamma B_1</i>

296
00:17:50,664 --> 00:17:53,555
has the frequency of <i>gamma B_1</i>
over <i>2 pi</i>

297
00:17:53,555 --> 00:17:56,670
and it has the period
of <i>2 pi</i> over <i>gamma B_1</i>--

298
00:17:56,670 --> 00:18:01,086
of course: this is the relationship
between frequency and period.

299
00:18:01,086 --> 00:18:02,750
So let's visualize this--

300
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,957
we're in the rotating reference frame,

301
00:18:04,957 --> 00:18:08,437
we have our coordinate system
in the rotating reference frame,

302
00:18:08,437 --> 00:18:12,338
we have this constant <i>B_1</i>
in this rotating reference frame,

303
00:18:12,338 --> 00:18:16,009
we have the equilibrium magnetization <i>M_0</i>

304
00:18:16,009 --> 00:18:20,180
and now we have applied this <i>B_1</i>
for a period of <i>tau</i>.

305
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:24,110
After this time <i>tau</i>, the <i>M_0</i>--
the magnetization--

306
00:18:24,110 --> 00:18:28,500
has precessed about <i>B_1</i>
by an angle <i>alpha</i>.

307
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,743
If the <i>B_1</i> is along <i>x</i>

308
00:18:30,743 --> 00:18:34,432
then <i>M_0</i> will precess in a <i>zy</i> plane

309
00:18:34,432 --> 00:18:39,723
and after time <i>tau</i> it has undergone
a rotation by the angle of <i>alpha</i>.

310
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:41,453
This angle is important.

311
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:45,374
As I'll define it here,
this angle is called the <i>flip angle</i>--

312
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:50,399
it describes the angle of rotation
induced by the...

313
00:18:51,096 --> 00:18:54,869
in this case by this <i>B_1</i> field

314
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,259
that was applied for <i>tau</i> seconds.

315
00:18:59,966 --> 00:19:03,217
What are the special cases
of the flip angle <i>alpha</i>?

316
00:19:03,217 --> 00:19:06,137
Special cases are 90 degrees.
If <i>alpha</i> is 90 degrees,

317
00:19:06,137 --> 00:19:09,338
we call that <i>excitation</i>,
or <i>full excitation</i>,

318
00:19:09,338 --> 00:19:13,329
that is, all the magnetization
that is along <i>z</i>, here in this example,

319
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:15,339
this equilibrium magnetization,

320
00:19:15,339 --> 00:19:19,770
is rotated into the transverse plane.
So we rotate <i>M_0</i>

321
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:23,481
from being along <i>z</i> into magnetization
in the transverse plane

322
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:28,038
and we often call this <i>M_xy</i>
for the transverse magnetization.

323
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:30,122
So that's this case here.

324
00:19:30,122 --> 00:19:33,736
We have rotated the magnetization
into the transverse plane.

325
00:19:34,103 --> 00:19:36,148
If we now double the duration

326
00:19:36,148 --> 00:19:38,623
so that we get an angle of 180 degrees

327
00:19:38,623 --> 00:19:40,724
then that is called an <i>inversion</i>.

328
00:19:40,724 --> 00:19:44,334
We go from an equilibrium magnetization
that's along <i>z</i> like this

329
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:46,765
to an equilibrium magnetization
that's opposite:

330
00:19:46,765 --> 00:19:50,286
minus <i>M_z</i> in the <i>minus z</i> direction,

331
00:19:50,286 --> 00:19:52,916
and that is called an inversion.

332
00:19:55,656 --> 00:20:00,467
So that's the situation here
after 180 degrees.

333
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:03,218
And if we leave the <i>B_1</i> on,

334
00:20:03,218 --> 00:20:06,979
then the magnetization
will precess around <i>B_1</i>

335
00:20:06,979 --> 00:20:10,630
for as long as we leave this <i>B_1</i> field on.

336
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,720
Now <i>B_1</i> is called
the <i>radiofrequency field</i>.

337
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,270
Why?

338
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:20,561
Can you picture this?

339
00:20:21,382 --> 00:20:25,652
Why is this called a radiofrequency field?

340
00:20:26,722 --> 00:20:28,643
It helps here to remind ourselves,

341
00:20:28,643 --> 00:20:33,374
we've said <i>B_1</i> is stationary--
that does not change with time

342
00:20:33,374 --> 00:20:37,879
in the rotating reference frame
that rotates with the Larmor frequency.

343
00:20:38,596 --> 00:20:40,725
What does that mean
if I look at it from the outside?

344
00:20:40,725 --> 00:20:43,412
What form does the <i>B_1</i> have?

345
00:20:43,412 --> 00:20:47,606
Well, my hand's already telling you
it's rotating.

346
00:20:47,606 --> 00:20:50,557
So, in the lab frame,
seen from the outside,

347
00:20:50,557 --> 00:20:53,917
we have actually,
the <i>B_1</i> is a time-dependent field.

348
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:56,552
It is given by <i>B_1</i>, the amplitude,

349
00:20:56,552 --> 00:21:01,268
and it rotates exactly
with the Larmor frequency, <i>omega_L</i>.

350
00:21:02,508 --> 00:21:05,399
Now, why do we call this radiofrequency?

351
00:21:05,399 --> 00:21:08,101
Because, if we look at
the Larmor frequency,

352
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:11,130
we take for protons the gyromagnetic ratio

353
00:21:11,130 --> 00:21:13,011
which is <i>42MHz per Tesla</i>,

354
00:21:13,011 --> 00:21:18,571
we calculate the Larmor frequency in Hertz

355
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:22,282
and we'll find that this is typically
on the order of 100MHz--

356
00:21:22,282 --> 00:21:25,133
so it's perfectly in the range
of radiofrequency.

357
00:21:25,133 --> 00:21:30,583
Actually, here it is in the range of,
truly, the radiofrequency of 100MHz.

358
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:35,313
And that's why the <i>B_1</i> is called
radiofrequency field.
