1
00:00:04,196 --> 00:00:06,112
In this section,
we are going to address

2
00:00:06,112 --> 00:00:09,734
the question on how
is the linear attenuation coefficient

3
00:00:09,734 --> 00:00:11,902
dependent on the tissue.

4
00:00:12,272 --> 00:00:14,879
So to recap, we have
the attenuation coefficient here

5
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:18,267
it's a mass attenuation coefficient
for iodine and lead.

6
00:00:18,267 --> 00:00:20,908
We see the absorption edges,
we have them twice

7
00:00:20,908 --> 00:00:22,602
for the different binding energies.

8
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:25,126
This is the k-shell,
this is the l-shell here.

9
00:00:25,126 --> 00:00:31,458
We have bone, muscle, and fat are
the acting mass attenuation coefficients.

10
00:00:31,965 --> 00:00:35,738
And now, if we just focus on Compton
and photoelectric effect,

11
00:00:35,738 --> 00:00:40,038
then we can see that in tissue,
the total linear attenuation coefficient

12
00:00:40,038 --> 00:00:42,401
can be seen as a relationship

13
00:00:42,401 --> 00:00:44,868
from a contribution
from the photoelectric effect,

14
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:47,542
certainly at the low energies,
and at the higher energies

15
00:00:47,542 --> 00:00:50,916
it's the Compton effect
that prevails.

16
00:00:50,916 --> 00:00:54,863
But what's important here
is that the linear attenuation coefficient

17
00:00:54,873 --> 00:01:00,400
in this case of water,
is the contribution of the x-rays

18
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,552
from Compton
and photoelectric effect

19
00:01:04,552 --> 00:01:06,997
and therefore energy dependent.

20
00:01:07,008 --> 00:01:08,843
Now let's look at Compton.

21
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:12,660
Compton mainly depends
on the number of outer shell electrons

22
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:16,219
per volume, per [inaudible] present,

23
00:01:16,219 --> 00:01:20,455
so it mainly depends
on the electron density <i>ρ</i>.

24
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:24,042
Therefore, it is only modestly
dependent on the energy

25
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,520
of the x-rays.

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:28,912
[inaudible] here,
and this we can see here,

27
00:01:29,142 --> 00:01:31,961
notice that we have
both scales, again, logarithmic

28
00:01:31,961 --> 00:01:36,725
so this is a very modest
dependence with photon energy.

29
00:01:37,343 --> 00:01:39,592
So we can say
the linear attenuation coefficient

30
00:01:39,592 --> 00:01:42,512
due to the Compton effect
as a function of energy

31
00:01:42,512 --> 00:01:45,743
is proportional, essentially
to the density of the electrons

32
00:01:45,743 --> 00:01:49,745
and then some smooth function
as a function of energy.

33
00:01:51,115 --> 00:01:53,651
The photoelectric effect,
on the other hand

34
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:56,911
depends strongly
on the atomic number Z.

35
00:01:57,431 --> 00:02:00,244
This we can see here,
for iodine and lead

36
00:02:00,244 --> 00:02:04,090
for example, it has a strong effect
for the two.

37
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,227
So, this means for the Compton effect
we have for the photoelectric effect

38
00:02:12,227 --> 00:02:17,810
for biology we will look 
at an empirical effective atomic number

39
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:20,041
to calculate because we are typically
dealing with tissues

40
00:02:20,041 --> 00:02:24,089
which are a mixture of different atoms
and so different atomic numbers Z.

41
00:02:24,089 --> 00:02:27,824
And we have to deal
with these different contributions.

42
00:02:28,224 --> 00:02:31,768
So, the photoelectric effect--
this is from theory here--

43
00:02:31,768 --> 00:02:37,267
is proportional to the density
of the electrons.

44
00:02:37,267 --> 00:02:43,282
Τhe density of the electrons
depends on the energy of the photon.

45
00:02:43,282 --> 00:02:47,376
Remember, if we don't have enough
energy to ionize a k-shell

46
00:02:47,376 --> 00:02:51,270
then all the k-shell electrons
are not seen by the x-ray

47
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,513
so therefore the electron density
that can participate in the reaction

48
00:02:56,513 --> 00:03:00,974
is dependent
on the energy of the photon.

49
00:03:01,294 --> 00:03:03,637
The photoelectric effect here,
according to theory

50
00:03:03,637 --> 00:03:07,099
is proportional
to the effective set atomic number

51
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:09,730
to the power of 3.4,
and inversely proportional

52
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:14,747
to the energy of the photon
to the power of roughly 3.

53
00:03:15,537 --> 00:03:18,067
It decreases rapidly,
and this we can understand

54
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:20,342
from Compton
mechanical considerations.

55
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:22,359
I'll just give a plausibility
argument here

56
00:03:22,359 --> 00:03:26,100
that it is a match... if the match
of the energy of the photon

57
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,300
corresponds very closely
to the binding energy

58
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:32,521
then the interaction
is greatest.

59
00:03:33,961 --> 00:03:39,502
Now I want to provide

60
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:42,681
an empirical calculation
for the effective atomic number

61
00:03:42,681 --> 00:03:44,721
of biological tissue.

62
00:03:45,461 --> 00:03:48,034
We need this to have
an idea for estimating

63
00:03:48,034 --> 00:03:51,779
the linear attenuation coefficient
of the photoelectric effect.

64
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:54,888
And we'll start
with en empirical relationship.

65
00:03:54,888 --> 00:03:57,645
I've taken this
from the textbook Cho.

66
00:03:58,385 --> 00:04:02,170
I have not found a rigorous
demonstration of this

67
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:06,064
but we'll use this here
as ground truth that the calculation

68
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:09,754
of the effective atomic number
follows this equation here.

69
00:04:09,754 --> 00:04:11,805
It is very useful
so that we can understand

70
00:04:11,805 --> 00:04:15,238
certain properties of tissues

71
00:04:15,238 --> 00:04:19,099
and also how we can modify
the atomic number.

72
00:04:19,099 --> 00:04:21,024
So basically what
this equation says here:

73
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:23,594
the atomic number,
the effective atomic number

74
00:04:24,274 --> 00:04:27,275
is equal to the 3.4th root
of this sum here.

75
00:04:27,275 --> 00:04:30,936
This sum here is summed
over all tissue components

76
00:04:30,936 --> 00:04:34,775
to indicate by the index <i>i</i>
with a weighting factor <i>λ_i</i>

77
00:04:34,775 --> 00:04:39,015
times the atomic number <i>Z_i</i>
to the power of 3.4.

78
00:04:39,686 --> 00:04:44,699
The weighting coefficient <i>λ</i>
here is given by this expression here

79
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:49,257
where we have <i>P</i> is the percentage weight
of a compound <i>i</i>.

80
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:51,468
<i>Z</i> is the atomic number
of the compound <i>i</i>

81
00:04:51,468 --> 00:04:54,773
and <i>A</i> is the atomic weight
of compound <i>i</i>.

82
00:04:55,483 --> 00:04:59,447
So it's this term here, divided
by the sum of all components:

83
00:04:59,447 --> 00:05:02,886
tissue weight, percentage weight,
atomic number

84
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:04,957
and atomic weight, 
divided by atomic weight

85
00:05:04,957 --> 00:05:09,445
for all the components
that are considered in our tissue.

86
00:05:10,555 --> 00:05:14,613
So let me illustrate
this calculation, this formula

87
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:19,396
for estimating the effective
atomic number for water.

88
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:25,232
For hydrogen, we have Z,
we have one proton, so Z is 1.

89
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:28,070
We have only one proton,
so the atomic weight is 1.

90
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:32,803
And the percentage weight
is 11%.

91
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:36,971
We have two protons
and one oxygen in water.

92
00:05:36,971 --> 00:05:39,214
So let's look at the oxygen's extreme.

93
00:05:39,394 --> 00:05:44,021
Z is 8, so we have eight protons,
we have eight neutrons in the nucleus

94
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:48,783
so the atomic weight is 16,
and the percentage weight is 89%.

95
00:05:48,953 --> 00:05:55,032
Total weight of a water molecule is 18,
so 2/18 is 1/9, that's 11%

96
00:05:55,032 --> 00:06:00,591
and 16/18, that's 8/9,

97
00:06:00,591 --> 00:06:03,611
that is 89%.

98
00:06:04,691 --> 00:06:07,625
So, for the denominator,
that is this term here

99
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:11,147
we'll calculate this explicitly here,
here's the calculation.

100
00:06:11,147 --> 00:06:16,264
We have Z/A for hydrogen, Z/A for oxygen,
we have percentage weight

101
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:19,445
and we get
the denominator is 55.5.

102
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:26,781
So the <i>λ</i> for protons, <i>λ_i</i>,
<i>λ_1</i> here would be 11 / 55.5

103
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:29,287
and that is essentially 0.20.

104
00:06:29,287 --> 00:06:35,156
For the oxygen, the <i>λ</i> is 44.5
divided by 55.5,

105
00:06:35,156 --> 00:06:41,245
so it's <i>P_i</i> times <i>Z_i</i> over <i>A_i</i>,
so it's <i>P</i> divided by two,

106
00:06:41,245 --> 00:06:46,669
so this is 44.5 divided by 55.5,
this is 0.8.

107
00:06:46,669 --> 00:06:49,820
This is the weighting
factor <i>λ</i> for oxygen.

108
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:54,555
And with that, we've got the two lambdas,
we've got these terms here

109
00:06:54,555 --> 00:06:58,957
so this is for oxygen, 20%
is the percentage weight.

110
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:05,440
One is the <i>Z_i</i> over <i>A_i</i>
for hydrogen, that's 1.

111
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:12,078
We have here, this term,
and then we have 0.8 times this term

112
00:07:12,078 --> 00:07:17,008
times <i>Z</i> to the power of 3.4,
so 0.8 is the <i>λ</i>.

113
00:07:17,008 --> 00:07:21,446
This is the <i>Z</i> to 3.4,
this is the <i>Z</i> to 3.4 for hydrogen.

114
00:07:21,446 --> 00:07:25,877
This is 0.2 plus this term here,
and we take the 3.4th root.

115
00:07:25,877 --> 00:07:32,543
All this is 944 to the 3.4th root,
and we get a <i>Z</i> effective of 7.5.

116
00:07:34,034 --> 00:07:36,844
Now this makes sense, we have
a big contribution from oxygen.

117
00:07:36,844 --> 00:07:41,762
Oxygen has a set of eight, that the Z
is close to oxygen, that makes sense.

118
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:45,780
So, question,
How good were we?

119
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:50,752
Does this have
any resemblance with reality?

120
00:07:50,752 --> 00:07:56,684
So we will look at some select
biological tissues

121
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:58,952
the percentage
mass composition.

122
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:02,785
So we have all the elements here,
percentage mass commposition

123
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:07,454
hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, etc.,
oxygen, and so on.

124
00:08:07,454 --> 00:08:10,570
This is for fat, this is for muscle,
here's water,

125
00:08:10,570 --> 00:08:14,385
and we have the femur bone
as an example.

126
00:08:15,485 --> 00:08:19,754
Water is what we calculated,
and we want to compare that

127
00:08:19,754 --> 00:08:22,865
to some experimental values,
but we do not have exactly the values

128
00:08:22,865 --> 00:08:25,544
for water, so we'll
compare it to muscle.

129
00:08:25,854 --> 00:08:29,726
And we have found these values
in the literature.

130
00:08:29,726 --> 00:08:33,120
Z** effective for adipose tissue
was determined to be 6.

131
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,906
For striated muscle it was 7.4,
and for bone it was 12.

132
00:08:38,636 --> 00:08:41,414
And here, we can compare
the muscle with water

133
00:08:41,414 --> 00:08:44,671
because the carbon has a <i>Z</i> to <i>A</i>

134
00:08:44,671 --> 00:08:48,941
of 6/12, oxygen is 8/16,

135
00:08:48,941 --> 00:08:53,803
so it is 6/12, so we get
<i>Z</i> to <i>A</i> of 6/12.

136
00:08:53,803 --> 00:08:57,746
It is very similar to oxygen,
and so this is a good approximation

137
00:08:57,746 --> 00:09:00,250
of what we have for water.

138
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,813
So actually it turns out
that the 7.5 that we calculated

139
00:09:03,813 --> 00:09:06,477
based on this empirical
formula is very close

140
00:09:06,477 --> 00:09:10,112
to the reality as seen
in the muscle here.

141
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:16,449
So now I've shown you the calculation,
I've given you the formula

142
00:09:16,449 --> 00:09:22,107
for the calculation of the effective Z,
and the issue behind this

143
00:09:22,107 --> 00:09:25,832
is that we would like sometimes
to be in a situation

144
00:09:25,832 --> 00:09:28,221
to alter the contrast
of the tissue.

145
00:09:28,221 --> 00:09:32,112
We would like to inject, for example,
a substance into the bloodstream

146
00:09:32,112 --> 00:09:35,362
to depict the vessel structure
in the patient

147
00:09:35,362 --> 00:09:37,232
or in the organism of interest

148
00:09:37,232 --> 00:09:40,091
and so we would like to see
that the substance that we inject

149
00:09:40,091 --> 00:09:42,996
alters the absorption
of the x-rays.

150
00:09:43,436 --> 00:09:45,960
And these substances
that alter the contrast

151
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,740
they are called contrast agents.

152
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,557
And they're typically
administered exogenously

153
00:09:50,557 --> 00:09:52,969
that is, they don't exist
in our bodies,

154
00:09:52,969 --> 00:09:57,384
typically by infusion, but sometimes
also you swallow the compound.

155
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:02,887
For x-ray, they are compounds
that modify the effective <i>Z</i>.

156
00:10:03,187 --> 00:10:05,840
So, what is needed
for a contrast agent

157
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,930
for x-ray imaging
is a compound with high <i>Z</i>.

158
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,280
So, typically what is being used
are compounds with multiple iodine atoms

159
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,339
sometimes also used
with lanthanides.

160
00:10:17,719 --> 00:10:20,015
Here's an example
of a molecule.

161
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:24,200
We have one iodine,
we have the second iodine

162
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,011
and we have
the third iodine here.

163
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:28,776
So we have three iodines
on this molecule.

164
00:10:28,776 --> 00:10:32,780
Here's another example
of x-ray contrast agents.

165
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:37,085
We have the iodine here, here, here,

166
00:10:38,645 --> 00:10:41,305
here, and here.

167
00:10:43,485 --> 00:10:48,356
And so we have multiple
iodine atoms that are being absorbed,

168
00:10:48,356 --> 00:10:50,997
and actually we can see here
there's one iodine

169
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:53,065
that we forgot 
to highlight here.

170
00:10:53,065 --> 00:10:57,646
So there's six iodines
in this molecule that are present.

171
00:10:59,386 --> 00:11:02,102
So, the idea is we inject
a foreign compound

172
00:11:02,102 --> 00:11:05,108
that carries as many
heavy <i>Z</i> atoms on it

173
00:11:05,108 --> 00:11:08,115
so it has, for a given
concentration of the compound

174
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:12,062
it has an alteration
of the effective <i>Z</i>.

175
00:11:12,762 --> 00:11:16,459
And so here the question is, let's say
we have water and we add 10 millimoles

176
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:19,074
per kilogram of iodine
to the water.

177
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:23,301
And we want to know how much
is this effective <i>Z</i> altered.

178
00:11:24,658 --> 00:11:26,174
So let's look at iodine.

179
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:30,176
We have seen already
the pertinent numbers for water.

180
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:34,496
Iodine in this case
has a percentage weight of 0.127%.

181
00:11:35,139 --> 00:11:39,433
It's calculated by the concentration
of 10 millimoles per kilogram.

182
00:11:40,809 --> 00:11:43,418
For water, a kilogram is a liter.

183
00:11:43,418 --> 00:11:48,107
And the molecular weight
is 127 milligrams per millimole.

184
00:11:48,107 --> 00:11:52,784
<i>Z</i> for iodine is 53,
and the atomic weight is 127.

185
00:11:54,956 --> 00:11:59,341
<i>Z</i> is the number of protons,
<i>A</i> is the number of protons and neutrons.

186
00:12:00,127 --> 00:12:03,391
So now, let's do
the calculation for <i>Z</i> effective.

187
00:12:03,391 --> 00:12:07,019
We'll, for recapitulation,
we'll reproduce the formulas here.

188
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,975
So here's the formula
for <i>Z</i> effective.

189
00:12:09,535 --> 00:12:11,860
We have the calculation
of the lambdas.

190
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:17,294
The denominator of <i>λ</i>
is contribution of hydrogen,

191
00:12:17,294 --> 00:12:19,620
contribution of oxygen,
those are the same terms

192
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:25,156
and the contribution of iodine,
and instead of 55.5 we get 55.6.

193
00:12:25,156 --> 00:12:28,239
So, this is essentially
the denominator of pure H2O

194
00:12:28,239 --> 00:12:31,009
down to the third
significant digit

195
00:12:31,009 --> 00:12:33,848
so we can assume
that this is the same number.

196
00:12:33,848 --> 00:12:36,039
This has not changed the denominator

197
00:12:36,039 --> 00:12:38,447
and it's this sum that is here.

198
00:12:39,437 --> 00:12:45,139
So that means that the <i>λ</i>
for hydrogen and oxygen are as for water.

199
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:50,815
And we have the <i>λ</i> for hydrogen of 0.2,
and the λ for oxygen for 0.8

200
00:12:51,325 --> 00:12:54,261
and now we need
to calculate the <i>λ</i> for iodine.

201
00:12:54,761 --> 00:12:58,795
So, for the <i>λ</i> we have
the denominator is 55.6

202
00:12:59,225 --> 00:13:02,598
we have the percentage weight here,
it's 0.127%

203
00:13:02,598 --> 00:13:06,097
we have <i>Z</i> divided by <i>A</i>,
this gives us this term,

204
00:13:06,097 --> 00:13:11,570
and we obtain this tiny number here,
which is basically one per mill.

205
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:17,198
It's 9.5 times 10 to the power of -4,
this is 0.001, so it's 1 per mill,

206
00:13:17,198 --> 00:13:18,931
or 0.1%.

207
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:21,953
That's the <i>λ</i> here,
so it's much smaller.

208
00:13:22,582 --> 00:13:26,404
But, if we calculate Z effective
to the power of 3.4,

209
00:13:26,404 --> 00:13:28,862
so I take this formula
to the power of 3.4

210
00:13:28,862 --> 00:13:30,841
so I just calculate
this term here.

211
00:13:31,321 --> 00:13:33,718
Then we have to remember
that we multiply <i>Z</i>

212
00:13:33,718 --> 00:13:37,072
to the power of 3.4 times the lambdas,

213
00:13:37,072 --> 00:13:38,915
and so even though
this number is small

214
00:13:38,915 --> 00:13:41,884
we have a big number here
to the power of 3.4.

215
00:13:42,424 --> 00:13:45,983
This is for water, 944,
this number we get here

216
00:13:45,983 --> 00:13:49,417
and for iodine it's 690.

217
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:54,405
So in conclusion, the <i>Z</i> effective
for 10 millimolar iodine

218
00:13:54,405 --> 00:13:58,374
added to the water solution,

219
00:13:58,374 --> 00:14:02,222
the <i>Z</i> effective changes
from 7.5 to 8.8.

220
00:14:03,002 --> 00:14:06,567
That seems like a fairly modest change.

221
00:14:06,567 --> 00:14:08,958
So, we'll say, well,
the photoelectric effect

222
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:11,929
linear attenuation coefficient
is essentially proportional

223
00:14:11,929 --> 00:14:14,740
to the effective <i>Z</i>
to the power of 3.4.

224
00:14:15,403 --> 00:14:17,802
And if we take this calculation

225
00:14:17,802 --> 00:14:23,191
we see, we have this term here,
for water it's 944, pure water,

226
00:14:23,191 --> 00:14:25,501
and for water
plus 10 millimolar iodine

227
00:14:25,501 --> 00:14:30,341
we have this term here, is,
this is proportional to 1,650.

228
00:14:31,161 --> 00:14:36,046
It doesn't matter what the units
are for these numbers, 944 and 1,650.

229
00:14:36,046 --> 00:14:38,227
What matters is the relative term here.

230
00:14:38,227 --> 00:14:41,250
So the ratio of these two
essentially gives us the change

231
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:44,811
in linear attenuation coefficient
for the photoelectric effect

232
00:14:44,811 --> 00:14:47,091
at low photon energies.

233
00:14:47,091 --> 00:14:50,131
And you can see if we're
very generous in estimating this

234
00:14:50,131 --> 00:14:56,201
we actually see that 1,650
is close to twice as big

235
00:14:56,201 --> 00:15:00,982
as 900, so it's almost a two-fold increase

236
00:15:00,982 --> 00:15:04,385
in absorption of the x-rays.

237
00:15:04,385 --> 00:15:05,469
So imagine this.

238
00:15:05,469 --> 00:15:08,706
We have this molecule here
which is three iodines,

239
00:15:08,706 --> 00:15:11,194
so this means actually
three millimoles per kilogram

240
00:15:11,194 --> 00:15:16,575
of this molecule in water
will increase the absorption

241
00:15:16,575 --> 00:15:18,532
by nearly a factor of two.

242
00:15:18,532 --> 00:15:20,789
So that's a very potent
way of altering

243
00:15:20,789 --> 00:15:22,969
the absorption
of x-rays in tissue

244
00:15:22,969 --> 00:15:27,216
in the presence of these agents,
the presence of these molecules

245
00:15:28,116 --> 00:15:32,701
that are called contrast agents,
so they modify the contrast.

246
00:15:32,701 --> 00:15:35,846
And in the problem set, we give you
a similar calculation to do

247
00:15:35,846 --> 00:15:38,930
but instead of using iodine
we're going to use gadolinium.

248
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:41,897
Gadolinium is interesting
because it has similar effects

249
00:15:41,897 --> 00:15:46,126
on the x-ray image, but it is
also used used as a contrast agent

250
00:15:46,126 --> 00:15:50,059
in MRI, which we will discuss
later this semester.
