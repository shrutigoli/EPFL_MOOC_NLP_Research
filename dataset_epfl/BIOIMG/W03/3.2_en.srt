1
00:00:04,309 --> 00:00:08,106
So, in the next two sections,
I'd like to discuss

2
00:00:08,106 --> 00:00:12,789
the four fundamental interactions
of x-rays with biological tissue

3
00:00:12,789 --> 00:00:15,641
that are to be considered.

4
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,602
Let's start out with Rayleigh scattering.

5
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:24,777
In Rayleigh scattering, this happens
when the light interacts with particles

6
00:00:24,777 --> 00:00:28,582
whose dimensions are much smaller
than the wavelength of the light.

7
00:00:28,582 --> 00:00:32,515
So, the dimension of the object, x,

8
00:00:32,515 --> 00:00:36,495
is 2πr, roughly, divided by λ

9
00:00:36,495 --> 00:00:39,716
if you express it, so the dimension
of the object 2πr,

10
00:00:39,716 --> 00:00:43,344
with respect to the wavelength
we get this dimensionless parameter x,

11
00:00:43,344 --> 00:00:46,905
and for Rayleigh scattering to occur,
this parameter x

12
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:52,268
has to be much smaller than 1.

13
00:00:52,268 --> 00:00:55,972
So in other words, the wavelength
has to be much bigger than the dimension

14
00:00:55,972 --> 00:01:00,440
or the radius of the scattering
particle that is present.

15
00:01:02,013 --> 00:01:05,523
We have an elastic scattering

16
00:01:05,523 --> 00:01:07,366
so the photon energy is constant.

17
00:01:07,366 --> 00:01:11,253
We have the incident photon
with a wavelength λ1.

18
00:01:11,253 --> 00:01:13,650
It is being scattered by the scatterer.

19
00:01:13,650 --> 00:01:19,790
It has the wavelength λ2,
and for Rayleigh scattering

20
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,534
the condition is that λ1
is equal to λ2.

21
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,848
In this case, since the photon
does not change the wavelength

22
00:01:28,848 --> 00:01:34,173
it does not change the energy,
and therefore it is non-ionizing.

23
00:01:34,173 --> 00:01:39,910
It is classical scattering
of a wave with a particle.

24
00:01:41,162 --> 00:01:45,210
Now, the equation that I'm interested here
to discuss is this one,

25
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,653
and I'll just keep it provided here
without the derivation.

26
00:01:48,653 --> 00:01:51,187
This says that the intensity
of the scattered light

27
00:01:51,187 --> 00:01:55,358
is equal to the incident light,
times some number of constants,

28
00:01:55,358 --> 00:02:01,592
and what we're really interested here
is this term 1/λ to the power of 4.

29
00:02:01,592 --> 00:02:03,263
So we'll just look at that.

30
00:02:03,263 --> 00:02:06,533
So the intensity is proportional
to the density

31
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:12,940
of the scattering particles ρ
divided by λ to the power of 4.

32
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:16,421
So what this means is,
the shorter the wavelength of the light

33
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:22,046
as it is being scattered, the higher
is the intensity of the scattered light.

34
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:28,511
So, it means that infrared light
is less scattered

35
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:32,089
and ultraviolet light is more scattered.

36
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:36,148
Or red light is less scattered,
blue light is more scattered.

37
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:39,857
And so, what the observer,
if here's the source, say the sun,

38
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:44,490
we have particles in here
that scatter the light.

39
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:48,828
Then the observer sees the intensity here
more for the short wavelength

40
00:02:48,828 --> 00:02:51,928
of the scattered light, that is, blue.

41
00:02:51,928 --> 00:02:57,091
And this is essentially the reason
why we see blue sky.

42
00:02:57,091 --> 00:03:00,934
Whenever you look at the sky,
you see Rayleigh scattering.

43
00:03:00,934 --> 00:03:02,549
That's why our sky is blue.

44
00:03:02,549 --> 00:03:06,515
The sunlight is pretty much
white when it comes in,

45
00:03:06,515 --> 00:03:09,882
but the sky that we see is blue
because that is scattering

46
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:13,719
in the atmosphere of the sunlight.

47
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:16,364
Here's an illustration,
you can actually reproduce

48
00:03:16,364 --> 00:03:21,185
the Rayleigh scattering at home.

49
00:03:21,185 --> 00:03:25,558
What you see in this video
is as you fill the bathtub with water--

50
00:03:25,558 --> 00:03:29,431
water, if you look at water in a glass,
it's clear, it has no color.

51
00:03:29,431 --> 00:03:33,520
But as you fill the bathtub with water,
as you can see in this video,

52
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,310
the color of the water
turns increasingly blue.

53
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,692
And this is because the light
that is incident on the water

54
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:44,745
is being scattered,
and since the scattering occurs

55
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:49,350
intensity is proportional to 1
over the wavelength to the fourth power,

56
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:53,289
we see increasingly
the short wavelength light

57
00:03:53,289 --> 00:03:56,976
that is... it goes towards the blue
we don't see as much of the red

58
00:03:56,976 --> 00:03:59,050
and therefore it changes color.

59
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:04,531
This is also the reason
why the lakes,

60
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:08,154
when we look at lakes
from outside they are blue.

61
00:04:08,154 --> 00:04:12,065
Again, water itself has no color,
but when we look at the scattering

62
00:04:12,065 --> 00:04:16,500
that is a lake with sufficient depth,
then we see that the water

63
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,489
takes a blueish color.

64
00:04:18,489 --> 00:04:22,283
That is purely an effect
of Rayleigh scattering.

65
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:28,542
Another effect is, like I mentioned,
the blue sky, but also the red sunset.

66
00:04:29,222 --> 00:04:32,975
So if you have a red sunset, it means
that there are scattering particles

67
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:34,521
in the air.

68
00:04:34,521 --> 00:04:37,852
This is typically
either humidity or smog.

69
00:04:37,852 --> 00:04:43,341
So, you have in areas where you have
pollution but not too strong pollution,

70
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:45,691
then you can have
beautiful red sunsets.

71
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:50,765
The red sunsets are a manifestation
of the smog that's in the air,

72
00:04:50,765 --> 00:04:55,154
or if you have humidity in the air,
so just before a thunderstorm

73
00:04:55,154 --> 00:04:58,967
for example, or before it starts to rain
and the air is humid,

74
00:04:58,967 --> 00:05:04,813
then you also do get very colorful,
very red sunsets.

75
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:11,272
So this is an example here of a picture
and the experiment

76
00:05:11,272 --> 00:05:17,635
that we will be showing shortly
is illustrating in the classroom setting

77
00:05:17,635 --> 00:05:22,404
the effect
of Rayleigh scattering

78
00:05:22,404 --> 00:05:27,024
demonstrated
with an experimental setup.

79
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:33,285
In this experiment, we will demonstrate
the Rayleigh scattering,

80
00:05:33,285 --> 00:05:40,282
the effect that we see on moist
or polluted evenings, the red sunset.

81
00:05:40,282 --> 00:05:44,223
So what we have here is water,
I will inject into it an alcohol.

82
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:49,050
This will create colloid particles
with this mixture in here

83
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:54,833
and start blocking out
the short wavelength light

84
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,537
and only the long wavelength light
will pass through here,

85
00:05:57,537 --> 00:05:59,869
will be reflected by the mirror,
and we should see

86
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:03,362
the reflection there
of the light on the wall

87
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:05,739
turn gradually into red.

88
00:06:05,739 --> 00:06:08,714
So what I will do is now
I will inject

89
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:11,165
the solution.

90
00:06:16,331 --> 00:06:18,781
This is chemistry,
so we stir well.

91
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,559
And now we'll just have to wait

92
00:06:23,559 --> 00:06:27,169
for the colloids to form.

93
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:30,682
And this will take a while.

94
00:06:31,318 --> 00:06:33,775
So now we have
the mixture in there.

95
00:06:35,705 --> 00:06:37,187
And we'll focus on here.

96
00:06:37,187 --> 00:06:41,102
We should start to see it
gradually change color.

97
00:06:43,056 --> 00:06:44,988
Just like a sunset.

98
00:06:48,092 --> 00:06:52,133
At the same time,
as only the red light passes through,

99
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:58,194
we will be seeing this turn blueish
before it becomes so thick

100
00:06:58,194 --> 00:07:00,891
that we won't see anything,
and that is basically simulating

101
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:03,081
the situation as we have it

102
00:07:03,081 --> 00:07:07,831
in some of the bigger cities
in, say, China

103
00:07:07,831 --> 00:07:11,051
where the pollution is very thick.

104
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:27,875
Now we're starting to see
it's turning slightly reddish.

105
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:32,187
On here, it has started
changing the color,

106
00:07:32,187 --> 00:07:35,230
and at the same time if you look here
now you see this has become

107
00:07:35,230 --> 00:07:36,994
a little bit blue here.

108
00:07:36,994 --> 00:07:39,588
Clearly it is becoming blue,
just like our sky

109
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:42,283
because the red light,
the long wavelength

110
00:07:42,283 --> 00:07:43,504
has been filtered out.

111
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:46,168
Now it's increasing,
now we can see very clearly

112
00:07:46,168 --> 00:07:50,628
the changing color up here,
so only the long wavelength light

113
00:07:50,628 --> 00:07:54,594
goes through, the short wavelength light
is being scattered by Rayleigh scatttering

114
00:07:54,594 --> 00:08:00,560
and you see how it simultaneously
is turning here increasingly blueish.

115
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,680
That means the red light
is passing through

116
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,142
and it's only the blue light
that is scattering.

117
00:08:07,142 --> 00:08:09,317
And now we have
a really nice sunset here.

118
00:08:09,317 --> 00:08:13,562
It's getting more and more red.

119
00:08:15,655 --> 00:08:19,361
And we're seeing here the blue light.

120
00:08:22,864 --> 00:08:26,556
So now that's typical of a sunset
with very moist air

121
00:08:26,556 --> 00:08:28,833
or high pollution in the air.

122
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:32,213
The sun is setting very red,
we have the red light here.

123
00:08:35,482 --> 00:08:37,499
So now you have
the demonstration

124
00:08:37,499 --> 00:08:40,535
in classroom here
of the Rayleigh scattering effect

125
00:08:40,535 --> 00:08:47,406
that explains to us why the sunsets are,
in moist air, are red in color

126
00:08:47,406 --> 00:08:52,686
as well as sometimes the moon
when we catch it early in the morning.

127
00:08:56,318 --> 00:09:02,069
So, now if we have Rayleigh scattering,
as we will see the scattered photons

128
00:09:02,069 --> 00:09:03,380
are not good for imaging.

129
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:07,619
They have a deleterious effect
on image quality.

130
00:09:07,619 --> 00:09:13,100
They are not good as the light
that is being scattered, the x-rays.

131
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,434
Now fortunately for x-ray imaging,
Rayleigh scattering

132
00:09:17,434 --> 00:09:20,506
is really not an important effect.

133
00:09:20,506 --> 00:09:23,945
It has a low probability of occurring
in x-ray imaging.

134
00:09:23,945 --> 00:09:26,536
Now, why is this so?

135
00:09:26,536 --> 00:09:29,842
Remember we had the requirement
that the wavelength

136
00:09:29,842 --> 00:09:33,407
must be longer than
the dimensions of the scatterer.

137
00:09:33,407 --> 00:09:35,359
And we have introduced last week
the relationship

138
00:09:35,359 --> 00:09:38,304
that we calculate the energy
in kiloelectron volts (keV).

139
00:09:38,304 --> 00:09:44,839
It's equal to 1.2/λ,
which is the wavelength in nanometers.

140
00:09:45,445 --> 00:09:48,606
So we can, from the photon energy,
calculate the wavelength

141
00:09:48,606 --> 00:09:52,021
with this expression,
and this is what we are doing here.

142
00:09:52,026 --> 00:09:56,955
So we'll take for 100 keV,
we can calculate, therefore,

143
00:09:56,955 --> 00:10:01,421
the wavelength, and we'll find
that the wavelength for a 100 keV photon

144
00:10:01,421 --> 00:10:06,106
is 0.12 nanometers,
or it's a tenth of an angstrom.

145
00:10:06,106 --> 00:10:08,062
Now remember,
we had the requirement

146
00:10:08,062 --> 00:10:11,281
that the wavelength of the x-ray

147
00:10:11,281 --> 00:10:14,664
should be large compared
to the dimensions of the scatterer.

148
00:10:14,664 --> 00:10:19,918
Now atoms, the dimensions of atoms
are on the order of angstrom,

149
00:10:19,918 --> 00:10:23,795
and we are already here at a wavelength
that is a fraction of an angstrom,

150
00:10:23,795 --> 00:10:28,343
and therefore we do not have scatterers
that satisfy at this high photon energy

151
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:31,885
the requirement for Rayleigh
scattering to occur,

152
00:10:31,885 --> 00:10:35,350
and, therefore,
it's probability is very low,

153
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,285
and we can for the most part
ignore its existence

154
00:10:40,285 --> 00:10:43,995
in the x-ray imaging.

155
00:10:43,995 --> 00:10:46,836
If we take for example, instead of 100 keV

156
00:10:46,836 --> 00:10:52,006
we take 10 keV x-rays,

157
00:10:52,006 --> 00:10:57,344
then we're getting a wavelength
of 1.2 angstrom, 0.12 nanometers.

158
00:10:57,344 --> 00:11:02,821
This is still very small compared
to the size of most molecules

159
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:06,888
that we encounter.

160
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:10,411
Now, I'd like to go on
with the second effect

161
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:12,313
and that's Compton scattering.

162
00:11:12,313 --> 00:11:16,658
Compton scattering
is a very important effect,

163
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:18,756
and we're going to spend
a little bit more time

164
00:11:18,756 --> 00:11:21,530
discussing the Compton effect.

165
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:25,105
What happens in Compton
in this type of scattering?

166
00:11:25,105 --> 00:11:29,524
We have an incident x-ray, that x-ray
interacts with an outer shell electron.

167
00:11:30,254 --> 00:11:37,056
This outer shell electron is then ejected,
and a scattered x-ray is being produced.

168
00:11:37,056 --> 00:11:41,576
Here's an example of an experiment
that illustrates the Compton effect.

169
00:11:41,576 --> 00:11:46,733
We have an x-ray that is incident,
and then an electron is being produced,

170
00:11:46,733 --> 00:11:50,295
a free electron, it's ionizing.
This is measured in the magnetic field

171
00:11:50,295 --> 00:11:53,713
so the electron undergoes
a spiral trajectory

172
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,377
until it comes to rest.

173
00:11:56,377 --> 00:12:03,012
This is a cloud chamber demonstration
of the electron that's being produced.

174
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:09,547
Okay, so here we have a chamber
with saturated water vapor.

175
00:12:09,547 --> 00:12:11,782
We have here the source
of the radioactivity.

176
00:12:11,782 --> 00:12:13,640
These are beta particles.

177
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:18,498
And when I depress the tension
in this chamber,

178
00:12:18,498 --> 00:12:21,759
we will see the condensation
of the electrons

179
00:12:21,759 --> 00:12:27,422
as they pass through
the saturated water vapor.

180
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:30,361
Three, two, one...

181
00:12:32,472 --> 00:12:35,324
Okay, to come back
to Compton scattering,

182
00:12:35,324 --> 00:12:38,179
it occurs at the outer shell electrons.

183
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:44,290
It leads to ionization,
producing an ionized atom

184
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:45,951
and an electron.

185
00:12:47,205 --> 00:12:49,651
So, what we are really looking
at the process here

186
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:52,824
is we have an incident photon,
we have an electron,

187
00:12:52,824 --> 00:12:58,065
we have a scattered electron, μ prime,
and we have the ejected electron.

188
00:12:58,565 --> 00:13:01,964
Well, suppose that the electron
is addressed initially

189
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:06,330
and it gains energy
through this scattering process.

190
00:13:07,668 --> 00:13:11,322
Now this process can be viewed
as a simple collision.

191
00:13:12,672 --> 00:13:15,177
And for this collision,
we will neglect

192
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:19,093
the binding energy
of the outer shell electron.

193
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:22,166
Why can we do that?

194
00:13:22,166 --> 00:13:27,030
Well, consider we have an incident
photon with an energy of 100 keV,

195
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,930
and we have a binding shell energy

196
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:35,423
of an outer shell electron of say 2.5 keV.

197
00:13:35,423 --> 00:13:38,722
This is two and a half percent
of the energy of the photon,

198
00:13:38,722 --> 00:13:41,498
so we'll make a very good
approximation assuming

199
00:13:41,498 --> 00:13:46,752
that we can neglect the binding energy
of the outer shell electron.

200
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:49,655
Compton effect is named after
Sir Arthur Holly Compton.

201
00:13:49,655 --> 00:13:51,751
He received for his discovery
of this effect

202
00:13:52,429 --> 00:13:57,744
named after him, the Nobel Prize
in Physics in 1927.

203
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:01,883
So, we produce a scattered photon.

204
00:14:01,883 --> 00:14:05,651
The scattered photon has subsequent
interactions in the tissue.

205
00:14:05,651 --> 00:14:10,019
These can be what we've discussed.
These can be, then, Rayleigh scattering;

206
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:14,239
they can be subsequent
Compton events, Compton scattering

207
00:14:14,239 --> 00:14:18,192
or, which is what we'll discuss
after the Compton effect,

208
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:20,903
photoelectric effects.

209
00:14:20,903 --> 00:14:24,731
So, there are subsequent
interactions for this photon.

210
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:28,658
In general, the probability
for Compton scattering to occur,

211
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:33,384
it increases with photon energy,
and it increases with electron density.

212
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:39,392
The second one makes sense,
as the electron density increases

213
00:14:39,392 --> 00:14:42,108
there are more outer shell electrons
present in the tissue

214
00:14:42,108 --> 00:14:45,183
so the probability
of the x-ray interacting

215
00:14:45,183 --> 00:14:47,668
with an outer shell
electron increases.

216
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:56,993
Now, typically in tissues we have
the electron-to-mass density is constant,

217
00:14:58,313 --> 00:15:03,114
is pretty much constant,
and so the electron density

218
00:15:03,114 --> 00:15:07,048
is largely independent
of the atomic number.

219
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:10,873
And so the Compton effect
is pretty much proportional

220
00:15:10,873 --> 00:15:13,762
to the density of the material.

221
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:18,107
So, we are going to take you
back to a brief tour

222
00:15:18,107 --> 00:15:20,139
of first-year physics.
Most of you probably

223
00:15:20,139 --> 00:15:27,043
have had some special relativity in your
first-year physics courses or later.

224
00:15:27,043 --> 00:15:30,098
Basically the phenomenon
that we are observing here

225
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:34,151
is we have a photon
that imparts the electron.

226
00:15:34,151 --> 00:15:39,704
The electron gains momentum,
and the photon is deviated here

227
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:41,307
by this angle θ.

228
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,756
So the incident photon
hits the electron here.

229
00:15:43,756 --> 00:15:46,380
The electron is ejected
in a certain distance,

230
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:50,488
and the photon is deflected
by this angle θ.

231
00:15:51,728 --> 00:15:55,658
And so, we will take now
the definition of linear momentum

232
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:57,150
in its relativistic form.

233
00:15:57,150 --> 00:15:59,796
So linear momentum
is mass times velocity.

234
00:15:59,796 --> 00:16:04,293
The mass here is the rest mass
divided by the square root of this factor.

235
00:16:04,293 --> 00:16:07,776
That's the relativistic mass
times the velocity.

236
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:12,288
That's the relativistic expression
for linear momentum.

237
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:16,488
We can now calculate
the magnitude of linear momentum,

238
00:16:16,488 --> 00:16:19,633
that is, take the scalar product
of linear momentum with itself.

239
00:16:19,633 --> 00:16:22,346
We get this expression
here on the right.

240
00:16:22,346 --> 00:16:25,283
That's just multiplying this with itself.

241
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:29,929
And then we can actually show
that the value of <i>p</i>,

242
00:16:29,929 --> 00:16:33,609
that is the norm of <i>p</i>,
is equal to <i>E</i> squared

243
00:16:33,609 --> 00:16:39,027
minus <i>m0 c</i> squared,
<i>m0</i> squared, <i>c</i> to the power of four.

244
00:16:39,027 --> 00:16:44,257
We'll take the relativistic energy,
that's <i>m0</i>,

245
00:16:45,277 --> 00:16:49,053
that's this term,
that's the relativistic kinetic energy.

246
00:16:49,053 --> 00:16:52,133
Mass as a function of velocity,
that's this term here

247
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,620
times <i>c</i> squared,
that's the famous formula

248
00:16:54,620 --> 00:16:57,870
of this gentleman here,
E=mc2

249
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:01,680
and we'll take this term here,

250
00:17:03,450 --> 00:17:07,720
which is added here

251
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,330
and when we do
the calculation here,

252
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,400
then we find
that this term here

253
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,458
so we've taken
this term here minus this.

254
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,760
If we replaced <i>E</i> squared
with <i>mc</i> squared

255
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,485
so that's <i>mc</i>
to the power of four.

256
00:17:23,485 --> 00:17:26,666
<i>m</i> is here,
that's this term squared.

257
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:29,607
We'll take this term here, 
which is this term here,

258
00:17:29,607 --> 00:17:32,800
but we'll have made
the denominator the same.

259
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:37,434
And then we obtain, we can simplify this,
and we'll find that this term here

260
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:42,475
is equal to the linear momentum
times the speed of light squared.

261
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,776
So to summarize,
we have a vector problem

262
00:17:45,776 --> 00:17:48,874
incident linear momentum
of the photon.

263
00:17:48,874 --> 00:17:51,438
We have the linear momentum
of the electron afterwards

264
00:17:51,438 --> 00:17:54,002
and the linear momentum
of the photon afterwards

265
00:17:54,002 --> 00:18:00,324
and here the scattering of the light
of the photon happens by the angle θ.

266
00:18:01,058 --> 00:18:06,525
So to conclude this, we have
a relationship between <i>p</i> squared

267
00:18:07,235 --> 00:18:11,673
that is, the value of <i>p</i> in squared
is equal to this term here.

268
00:18:12,293 --> 00:18:14,889
Now, there are some
interesting consequences.

269
00:18:15,769 --> 00:18:18,283
We know that light carries energy.

270
00:18:18,283 --> 00:18:20,583
If we go outside we warm up
in the sunlight

271
00:18:20,583 --> 00:18:24,448
so, obviously, the light that comes
from the sun carries energy.

272
00:18:25,388 --> 00:18:30,023
Yet, light moves at, by definition,
by the speed of light.

273
00:18:30,023 --> 00:18:32,574
So, if we look at
this expression here,

274
00:18:33,724 --> 00:18:36,583
for the mass,
if the light had a mass,

275
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:39,753
then it would have
at the speed of light,

276
00:18:39,753 --> 00:18:43,794
infinite mass, so this means
that the photon

277
00:18:43,794 --> 00:18:48,715
with an energy <i>E</i>, is a particle
with rest mass equal to zero.

278
00:18:49,715 --> 00:18:52,646
So we have a rest mass
<i>m0</i> equals zero

279
00:18:52,646 --> 00:18:56,450
otherwise we would end up here
with an infinite linear momentum,

280
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,127
and its energy would be infinite
since the speed of light particles

281
00:19:00,127 --> 00:19:02,316
equals the speed of light.

282
00:19:02,316 --> 00:19:06,175
So what follows from this,
with this general equation here

283
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:09,224
it follows that the linear
momentum of a photon

284
00:19:09,224 --> 00:19:13,452
is equal to its energy divided
by the speed of light.

285
00:19:14,786 --> 00:19:17,321
And we are going to use
this relationship

286
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:21,414
in the following to derive
the Compton relationship

287
00:19:21,414 --> 00:19:25,635
that is so essential
for x-ray imaging techniques.

288
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,624
So, if we are looking at
Compton scattering,

289
00:19:30,624 --> 00:19:35,511
it is actually, as I pointed out,
it is a simple elastic condition.

290
00:19:35,928 --> 00:19:40,813
We have conservation of energy,
that is, the energy of the photon,

291
00:19:40,813 --> 00:19:43,713
the incident photon,
the initial energy of the photon,

292
00:19:43,713 --> 00:19:46,599
the rest energy
of the electron, <i>m e c</i> squared

293
00:19:46,599 --> 00:19:52,068
is equal to the final energy of the photon
and the total energy of the electron.

294
00:19:53,678 --> 00:19:56,771
This is before, and this is after.

295
00:19:57,891 --> 00:20:01,871
So, I will now take the term and isolate
the energy of the electron

296
00:20:01,871 --> 00:20:05,236
after the collision,
so we'll isolate this term here,

297
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:07,543
that is, we'll just move <i>Ef</i>
to the other side

298
00:20:07,543 --> 00:20:10,647
and we'll have this term here.

299
00:20:10,647 --> 00:20:14,160
Now we also, since it's a collision,
we have conservation of linear momentum.

300
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,030
It's an isolated system.

301
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,159
Initially, the only momentum that we have
is that of the incident photon.

302
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:24,078
And then, after the collision,
the final momentum of the photon

303
00:20:24,078 --> 00:20:27,927
and the momentum of the electron.

304
00:20:27,927 --> 00:20:31,311
So this is before, and this is after.

305
00:20:32,761 --> 00:20:36,685
And here, again, I will isolate the term
linked to the electron

306
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:39,323
after the collision, <i>p e</i>,
and we'll square it

307
00:20:39,323 --> 00:20:43,259
so <i>p e</i> squared equals
the initial photon energy,

308
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:47,672
photon momentum, minus
the final photon momentum squared.

309
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:53,954
And now we'll use the relationship
that <i>p e</i> squared is equal to the energy

310
00:20:53,954 --> 00:20:56,847
of the electron squared, 
divided by <i>c</i> squared

311
00:20:56,847 --> 00:21:00,123
minus <i>m e</i> squared <i>c</i> squared,
which is what we just derived

312
00:21:00,123 --> 00:21:02,605
on the previous slide.

313
00:21:02,605 --> 00:21:05,041
We'll use these two equations.

314
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:08,312
We have <i>p e</i> squared,
we have an expression for that.

315
00:21:08,312 --> 00:21:11,395
We have the energy
of the electron afterwards.

316
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:15,804
Also, we have an expression for the two,
we'll plug it in to this equation

317
00:21:15,804 --> 00:21:21,886
and solve for the energy of the scattered
photon, the final energy.

318
00:21:21,886 --> 00:21:25,966
So what we see in this relationship
is that the final energy of the photon

319
00:21:25,966 --> 00:21:28,400
depends on the initial energy 
of the photon

320
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:32,327
but also depends on the angle θ.

321
00:21:32,327 --> 00:21:34,774
And this is
what's important here is...

322
00:21:35,844 --> 00:21:40,482
if we know the incident
energy of the photon, <i>Ei</i>, this term here,

323
00:21:41,902 --> 00:21:46,443
and we know by what angle the photon...
and we know the energy of the photon.

324
00:21:46,443 --> 00:21:49,735
We can measure the energy
of the photon that is detected.

325
00:21:49,735 --> 00:21:53,567
From that relationship we can say
something about by what angle

326
00:21:53,567 --> 00:21:55,513
the photon has been scattered.

327
00:21:55,513 --> 00:22:00,361
And this is used in the x-ray techniques.

328
00:22:01,181 --> 00:22:06,407
I want to now also show another
version of the Compton formula,

329
00:22:06,407 --> 00:22:10,139
that is, if we use
the definition for wavelength

330
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:13,544
and for the energy here,
we replace now the energies

331
00:22:13,544 --> 00:22:16,739
with wavelength, then we get
the so-called Compton shift.

332
00:22:16,739 --> 00:22:21,022
That is the shift in wavelength,
the final wavelength

333
00:22:21,022 --> 00:22:24,915
of the scattered photon, minus
the wavelength of the initial photon

334
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:27,836
is equal to the number
of fundamental constants,

335
00:22:27,836 --> 00:22:31,561
Planck's constant, the mass
of the electron, speed of light

336
00:22:31,561 --> 00:22:34,390
times 1 minus cosine θ,
that is the angle

337
00:22:34,390 --> 00:22:38,556
by which the photon
has been scattered.

338
00:22:38,556 --> 00:22:42,258
So, let's look at some relationships.

339
00:22:42,258 --> 00:22:46,326
The final energy is maximal
if θ is equal to zero.

340
00:22:46,326 --> 00:22:51,262
We can verify that;
then we get the denominator here.

341
00:22:51,262 --> 00:22:56,746
This term is zero, and, therefore,
the final energy of the photon

342
00:22:56,746 --> 00:22:59,185
after scattering
is equal to the initial energy.

343
00:22:59,185 --> 00:23:03,791
It's as if the electron doesn't exist.

344
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:10,239
That is logical, because if it doesn't
scatter, then it does not lose any energy.

345
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:14,031
The energy of the photon
is minimal if θ is equal to π,

346
00:23:14,031 --> 00:23:15,623
that is, it's back-scattered.

347
00:23:15,623 --> 00:23:20,347
The photon moves, hits the electron,
and comes back in the same trajectory

348
00:23:20,347 --> 00:23:23,993
so the scattering angle
is 180 degrees, or equal to π,

349
00:23:23,993 --> 00:23:29,416
and then we can calculate for this case
the minimum energy of the photon

350
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,226
after scattering event
is given by this expression

351
00:23:32,226 --> 00:23:37,281
is simply having cosine θ equal to -1,
then we get the term 2 here.

352
00:23:37,281 --> 00:23:38,718
That's this term.

353
00:23:38,718 --> 00:23:42,279
So these are two particular cases.

354
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:46,712
One case that is of interest,
as we will see in three weeks

355
00:23:46,712 --> 00:23:49,297
is if the energy
of the photon that comes in

356
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:53,185
is equal to the rest
energy of the electron, <i>m e c</i> squared.

357
00:23:54,575 --> 00:23:58,200
That's for positron emission
tomography, and, in this case,

358
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,436
if <i>Ei</i> over <i>m e c</i> squared is 1,
then we have <i>m e c</i> squared

359
00:24:02,436 --> 00:24:04,224
here for the incident energy.

360
00:24:04,224 --> 00:24:06,720
That's we're just replacing
this relationship here,

361
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,603
and we have in the denominator
2 minus cosine θ.

362
00:24:12,513 --> 00:24:14,344
So let's look now,
on the y axis,

363
00:24:14,344 --> 00:24:16,714
we have the final energy,
the scattered energy

364
00:24:16,714 --> 00:24:20,089
divided by the incident
energy on the y axis

365
00:24:20,089 --> 00:24:23,248
as a function of the angle
here now in degrees,

366
00:24:23,248 --> 00:24:26,232
and we'll have now
two popular cases.

367
00:24:26,232 --> 00:24:31,871
One is metastable technetium,
very often used in medical imaging.

368
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:36,118
Here the energy relative to the rest
energy of the electron is equal to 0.027.

369
00:24:36,118 --> 00:24:40,523
That's this case here,
and for positron emission tomography,

370
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:44,353
that is this case here,
we have the energy of the photon

371
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:47,701
is equal to <i>m e c</i> squared,
we have this relationship

372
00:24:49,471 --> 00:24:52,706
that is seen here,
so it's a stronger dependence.

373
00:24:52,706 --> 00:24:56,698
Now what is the critical element here?

374
00:24:56,698 --> 00:25:00,696
The critical element here
is we have... the effect depends

375
00:25:00,696 --> 00:25:04,156
on the photon energies implicated,
so it depends on the isotope

376
00:25:04,156 --> 00:25:06,705
that's being used,
or the x-ray that's being used.

377
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:12,032
But also, what is crucial here is,
if we can calculate the final energy

378
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:14,790
relative to the initial energy,
if we can measure that,

379
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:18,600
then we can say, well, this photon
has been scattered by 90 degrees.

380
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,957
And if it's been scattered by 90 degrees
and we detect it

381
00:25:20,957 --> 00:25:23,389
then it's not a good photon,
it's been scattered too much

382
00:25:23,389 --> 00:25:28,324
and it's likely to represent an effect
in an area of the tissue

383
00:25:28,324 --> 00:25:32,383
where we don't want to measure,
and so based on this energy discrimination

384
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:36,470
we can eliminate
heavily scattered photons.

385
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:41,911
Okay, so what we have here
is a demonstration of the Compton effect.

386
00:25:41,911 --> 00:25:44,928
We have the radioactive source here,
that's the x-ray tube

387
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:46,872
which we've discussed last week.

388
00:25:46,872 --> 00:25:50,005
How the x-rays are being
produced in the tube.

389
00:25:50,005 --> 00:25:52,338
There's a little plastic
element in the middle.

390
00:25:52,338 --> 00:25:55,546
That serves as a scatterer,
and the detector is here.

391
00:25:55,546 --> 00:25:58,278
So at this point
we have a strong deflection angle.

392
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:00,437
And what we are measuring
and what you're hearing

393
00:26:00,437 --> 00:26:02,504
is the energy
of the photons detected.

394
00:26:02,504 --> 00:26:07,864
So we can see now at this big angle
of deflection we have a count of 260.

395
00:26:07,864 --> 00:26:10,189
The number is not important
what it means.

396
00:26:10,189 --> 00:26:14,536
And as I now reduce the angle
between the beam

397
00:26:14,536 --> 00:26:17,629
which is emitted in this direction,

398
00:26:18,839 --> 00:26:22,662
we can see that this gradually increases

399
00:26:22,662 --> 00:26:25,864
as the angle gets closer to zero degrees

400
00:26:25,864 --> 00:26:28,222
that is, the photon energy increases

401
00:26:28,222 --> 00:26:30,140
we have the scatterer here

402
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,834
and as we are going close to zero degree

403
00:26:33,834 --> 00:26:37,794
we have a very high count,
so very high photon energy

404
00:26:37,794 --> 00:26:39,988
in this direction.

405
00:26:40,513 --> 00:26:43,855
I'll increase the angle again,
away from zero

406
00:26:43,855 --> 00:26:47,580
and we can see how
as I gradually increase the angle

407
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:50,912
the photon energy is being reduced.
