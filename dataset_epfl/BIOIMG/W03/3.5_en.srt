1
00:00:04,565 --> 00:00:09,068
For today's segment, we want to now
also discuss the biological effects

2
00:00:09,068 --> 00:00:11,387
of ionizing radiation,
and exactly what are

3
00:00:11,387 --> 00:00:13,176
these biological effects?

4
00:00:13,313 --> 00:00:19,185
We have all a fairly good understanding
that x-rays are not very healthy

5
00:00:19,185 --> 00:00:20,614
as we've discussed.

6
00:00:20,614 --> 00:00:24,614
We need to put on sunscreen
to minimize ionizing radiation.

7
00:00:24,995 --> 00:00:31,046
And it is actually exactly those ionizing 
effects that are at the center stage here.

8
00:00:31,419 --> 00:00:34,526
The ionizing effects that are 
pretty much instantaneous.

9
00:00:34,526 --> 00:00:39,445
The minute the photon hits our molecule,
it produces an ionizing effect,

10
00:00:39,445 --> 00:00:43,014
produces a molecule
with a charge, it's ionized.

11
00:00:43,014 --> 00:00:45,436
This happens today and now.

12
00:00:46,506 --> 00:00:49,079
This can produce free radicals.

13
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:51,825
This can break chemical bonds.

14
00:00:51,825 --> 00:00:56,446
This can produce new chemical bonds
or cross linkage between macromolecules,

15
00:00:56,446 --> 00:00:58,427
for example in the eye.

16
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:03,636
Or it can damage molecules 
that regulate vital processes,

17
00:01:03,636 --> 00:01:08,886
for example, certain proteins, 
RNA and DNA.

18
00:01:09,872 --> 00:01:14,190
So what we have is the x-ray
that impacts on our cell,

19
00:01:14,190 --> 00:01:18,871
for example in this graphic here,
it breaks the DNA structure.

20
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:21,259
This happens instantaneously.

21
00:01:22,175 --> 00:01:25,818
It is now, if you're exposed 
to the x-ray this happens now.

22
00:01:26,565 --> 00:01:29,517
However, and this is one
of the difficulties here is

23
00:01:29,517 --> 00:01:31,968
that the biological effects are delayed.

24
00:01:31,968 --> 00:01:35,179
In the eye, we can have cataract formation
that's cross-linkage

25
00:01:35,179 --> 00:01:38,238
between molecules,
macromolecules, that's cataract.

26
00:01:38,238 --> 00:01:40,992
This can happen months later 
or years later,

27
00:01:40,992 --> 00:01:44,862
and if the cell is losing
its ability to autoregulate,

28
00:01:44,862 --> 00:01:46,652
this can produce cancer.

29
00:01:46,652 --> 00:01:49,510
This can happen years later
or decades later.

30
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:53,032
And this is the difficulty 
in managing the x-rays.

31
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:55,071
We cannot immediately 
see the effect.

32
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:58,169
We cannot immediately judge it,
and it is detached

33
00:01:58,169 --> 00:02:00,523
from the original event.

34
00:02:00,523 --> 00:02:04,118
So the disregulation of a cell,
when it loses autoregulation,

35
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:08,234
it starts to grow uncontrolled,
that's cancer-- develops into a tumor,

36
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:11,154
that happens months to years later.

37
00:02:12,184 --> 00:02:13,841
Sometimes it's relatively short,

38
00:02:13,841 --> 00:02:17,500
and here's an example of a person
who underwent actually

39
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:19,481
an angiogram in a CT scanner.

40
00:02:19,481 --> 00:02:24,076
So as you can see here on the hair,

41
00:02:24,951 --> 00:02:26,591
the hair cells on the surface

42
00:02:26,591 --> 00:02:29,065
they were exposed
to very high radiation in this case

43
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:33,428
and this created radiation damage
in the skin of this person

44
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:36,631
who lost the ability to grow hair.

45
00:02:36,631 --> 00:02:41,162
This was most likely temporary,
but it is an effect that happened

46
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:45,183
in the next few months after the scan.

47
00:02:46,621 --> 00:02:52,712
Now what complicates the assessment
of biological effects is

48
00:02:52,712 --> 00:02:56,562
that not all tissues are
equally sensitive to radiation.

49
00:02:57,313 --> 00:03:00,786
If you have a tissue that has
a rapid cell proliferation,

50
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:03,395
that divides the cells rapidly,

51
00:03:03,395 --> 00:03:08,822
then it is, the sensitivity
of that tissue is proportional

52
00:03:08,822 --> 00:03:11,878
to the rate of cell proliferation,
so it is high.

53
00:03:11,878 --> 00:03:15,124
So if you have a tissue that has
a lot of cell proliferation,

54
00:03:15,124 --> 00:03:20,119
then it is more sensitive 
to radiation.

55
00:03:20,119 --> 00:03:24,033
On the other hand, if the tissue
is highly differentiated,

56
00:03:24,033 --> 00:03:27,953
then it is less sensitive to radiation.

57
00:03:28,523 --> 00:03:32,764
And this is a very
practical consideration,

58
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:36,713
and actually we have a relatively 
high rate of cell proliferation

59
00:03:36,713 --> 00:03:39,342
in fetuses compared to old age,

60
00:03:39,342 --> 00:03:41,653
where our cells just don't divide as fast.

61
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:46,717
So a young person is much more
susceptible to the biological effects

62
00:03:46,717 --> 00:03:51,097
of radiation than an older person,
where it is less important.

63
00:03:51,357 --> 00:03:56,558
So the damage that is created

64
00:03:56,558 --> 00:04:01,463
is less of a concern
when you're increased in age.

65
00:04:01,947 --> 00:04:06,521
So this has considerations
on exposure to radiation,

66
00:04:06,521 --> 00:04:09,972
but also in, for example,
radiation cleanup,

67
00:04:09,972 --> 00:04:15,038
that is as in the cases of Fukushima
where they have used,

68
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:20,195
for the first firefighters that came
to work on the cleanup of the site,

69
00:04:20,195 --> 00:04:24,718
they preferably selected people
that were of older age

70
00:04:24,718 --> 00:04:28,558
than the younger firefighters
exactly for that reason.

71
00:04:28,558 --> 00:04:31,671
Another thing to consider is
at old age even if you develop a cancer

72
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:35,482
due to radiation exposure,
the cancers tend to grow slower

73
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:38,507
at old age, so there's 
a higher probability

74
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:41,432
that you might die of a heart attack

75
00:04:41,432 --> 00:04:45,216
rather than of the cancer
produced by the x-ray exposure.

76
00:04:45,844 --> 00:04:50,185
So if you look at sensitivity upwards

77
00:04:50,185 --> 00:04:53,976
then the nervous system
is not very sensitive.

78
00:04:53,976 --> 00:04:56,736
The muscle is a bit more sensitive.

79
00:04:56,736 --> 00:04:58,746
Then we have bone and teeth.

80
00:04:58,746 --> 00:05:00,566
We have the skin.

81
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:05,445
We have the reproductive organs,
and finally the blood-forming organs

82
00:05:05,445 --> 00:05:09,216
which are the most sensitive 
to radiation.

83
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:16,834
So one process is the production 
of radicals, that is compounds

84
00:05:16,834 --> 00:05:21,406
with unpaired valence electrons
and reactive oxygen species

85
00:05:21,406 --> 00:05:26,586
such as-- we have 2 OH's 
that produce hydrogen peroxide.

86
00:05:27,846 --> 00:05:33,106
Radicals and reactive oxygen species
are produced by processes

87
00:05:33,106 --> 00:05:35,636
that are naturally occurring
in the body.

88
00:05:35,636 --> 00:05:38,096
One such process is oxygen consumption.

89
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:42,075
It's the mitochondria 
that are responsible for that,

90
00:05:42,075 --> 00:05:45,358
and they are a powerhouse
of radical formation

91
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:49,338
and reactive oxygen species production.

92
00:05:49,338 --> 00:05:51,676
So it happens naturally in our body.

93
00:05:51,676 --> 00:05:55,417
And this is where the good news is:

94
00:05:55,417 --> 00:05:59,389
our body has to have,
in order to survive these processes,

95
00:05:59,389 --> 00:06:03,110
has to have developed 
defense mechanisms

96
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:08,628
against the production 
of radicals and reactive oxygen species,

97
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:11,495
and this is what 
we are going to discuss next.

98
00:06:13,099 --> 00:06:16,970
So how does the tissue defend itself
against radiation damage?

99
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:19,381
We can distinguish basically 
two processes.

100
00:06:19,381 --> 00:06:23,533
We have the x-ray
that produces an ionizing event.

101
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:27,674
This ionizing event happens
directly on the molecule

102
00:06:27,674 --> 00:06:31,363
of interest, so that would be 
the direct effect.

103
00:06:31,363 --> 00:06:33,704
We have ionizing event
directly on the DNA here

104
00:06:33,704 --> 00:06:36,813
in this example and that's direct damage.

105
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,681
We can also have an ionizing event
in another molecule.

106
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:44,148
This produces then water 
and an electron.

107
00:06:44,148 --> 00:06:48,714
This produces then H3O +
and a free electron,

108
00:06:48,753 --> 00:06:51,763
and through this reactive
oxygen species, we have

109
00:06:51,763 --> 00:06:54,862
the indirect effect 
through a chemical reaction.

110
00:06:56,123 --> 00:07:00,043
To look at DNA, which is
what we are mainly concerned with,

111
00:07:00,043 --> 00:07:05,823
the DNA is constantly subjected 
to processes that menace,

112
00:07:05,823 --> 00:07:08,103
that threaten its integrity.

113
00:07:08,103 --> 00:07:09,833
We have alkylating agents.

114
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,212
We have oxidizing agents.

115
00:07:11,212 --> 00:07:13,032
We have replication errors.

116
00:07:13,032 --> 00:07:16,373
We have aging, we have radiation,
natural radiation.

117
00:07:16,373 --> 00:07:18,253
We have diseases.

118
00:07:18,253 --> 00:07:21,783
And so the cells, our cells 
have developed mechanisms

119
00:07:21,783 --> 00:07:26,174
to provide for repair of the DNA,

120
00:07:26,174 --> 00:07:28,984
so there are, to account
for all these effects,

121
00:07:28,984 --> 00:07:31,354
there are repair mechanisms that exist.

122
00:07:32,077 --> 00:07:35,305
Now if you look at the healing 
of the tissue that's been exposed to x-ray

123
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:40,720
we are looking at essentially 
two fundamental ways.

124
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,367
One is repair.

125
00:07:43,298 --> 00:07:46,807
In repair, the cells in the tissue 
are being replaced

126
00:07:46,807 --> 00:07:49,906
with a different cell type.
Typically, it's fibrosis.

127
00:07:49,906 --> 00:07:53,017
In this case, the organ is 
not returned to the original state.

128
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:56,877
We take a liver cell, replace it
with a fiber cell.

129
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:59,386
There's not a liver cell again
in that tissue

130
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:01,946
or in the brain, for example.

131
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:07,266
In radioresistant tissues,
the tissues are less likely

132
00:08:07,266 --> 00:08:10,868
to be damaged by radiation,
such as muscle and brain.

133
00:08:10,868 --> 00:08:12,798
We can only do repair.

134
00:08:12,798 --> 00:08:15,238
This is the only mechanism that happens.

135
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:18,317
So in the brain, a cell 
that is being damaged by x-rays

136
00:08:18,317 --> 00:08:21,548
is not being replaced by a cell
of the same kind.

137
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:26,037
The other process of healing 
that happens is regeneration.

138
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:31,048
In this case, the cells
that are damaged by the x-rays

139
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:34,098
are replaced by the same type of cells.

140
00:08:34,788 --> 00:08:37,638
The organ is therefore returned 
to its original state.

141
00:08:37,638 --> 00:08:40,956
It still has the proper cells in there,

142
00:08:40,956 --> 00:08:43,591
and this, the process 
of regeneration, happens

143
00:08:43,591 --> 00:08:47,849
in tissues that are more sensitive 
to radiation such as skin.

144
00:08:48,469 --> 00:08:51,869
Skin regrowth, as we all know,
we have all cut ourselves,

145
00:08:51,869 --> 00:08:55,319
it happens in the digestive system
and bone marrow.

146
00:08:57,109 --> 00:09:00,629
These are the fundamental processes
of interaction of x-rays with tissue,

147
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:03,290
the damage how it's done,
but we still do not know

148
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:06,180
how to relate this to quantities
that we can measure

149
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,215
for our imaging techniques.

150
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:14,220
So the question is how do we quantify 
the effects of ionizing radiation?

151
00:09:15,189 --> 00:09:18,860
And here the literature is, 
at first glance, quite confusing

152
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:23,719
because there are three terms
of radiation dose that are being used.

153
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:26,000
First we have the absorbed dose.

154
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,278
The absorbed dose is essentially 
very simple.

155
00:09:29,373 --> 00:09:34,622
It's the energy deposited by the radiation
per unit mass of material.

156
00:09:34,622 --> 00:09:38,693
So it is essentially the energy per mass.

157
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:41,114
It's joules per kilogram is the unit,

158
00:09:41,114 --> 00:09:43,434
and here the unit Gray was introduced, Gy.

159
00:09:43,434 --> 00:09:45,806
That's the absorbed dose.

160
00:09:46,156 --> 00:09:50,435
So the absorbed dose here is given

161
00:09:50,435 --> 00:09:53,233
by the number of photons
times their energy.

162
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:55,604
Each photon carries a certain energy.

163
00:09:55,610 --> 00:09:59,081
If you have a 1,000 photons of them,
we deposit more energy per mass

164
00:09:59,081 --> 00:10:02,110
than if we have only 100 photons.

165
00:10:02,286 --> 00:10:06,994
So <i>D</i> is proportional to the photon energy
times the number of photons.

166
00:10:08,372 --> 00:10:11,684
So, in other words, the absorbed dose
depends on the intensity

167
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:14,852
of the incident x-ray 
and the duration of exposure.

168
00:10:14,852 --> 00:10:17,782
There is no per time here,
it's per mass.

169
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:22,066
The next term is the equivalent dose, <i>H</i>.

170
00:10:22,066 --> 00:10:24,803
And it is essentially equal 
to the absorbed dose,

171
00:10:24,803 --> 00:10:28,105
but then it's corrected 
for the possibility

172
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,145
of the type of radiation
that is being used

173
00:10:30,145 --> 00:10:33,495
to produce biological damage.

174
00:10:33,495 --> 00:10:37,646
Not all types of radioactivity 
produce the same kind of--

175
00:10:37,646 --> 00:10:40,525
can produce damage to biological tissue.

176
00:10:41,167 --> 00:10:43,186
So mathematically,

177
00:10:43,186 --> 00:10:48,236
<i>H</i> is again given
by the absorbed dose, <i>D</i>

178
00:10:48,236 --> 00:10:50,385
times W𝖱.

179
00:10:50,385 --> 00:10:52,797
This is a tissue weighting factor.

180
00:10:52,797 --> 00:10:57,436
Now the units to distinguish this
are given in sievert,

181
00:10:57,436 --> 00:10:59,836
in SI units, still as joules per kilogram

182
00:10:59,836 --> 00:11:03,174
because the tissue weighting factor
is dimensionless.

183
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:06,307
And the good news is, 
for biomedical imaging,

184
00:11:06,307 --> 00:11:10,646
we have a tissue weighting factor
of 1 for x-rays and β particles.

185
00:11:10,646 --> 00:11:14,646
Those are the majority 
of ionizing radiation

186
00:11:14,646 --> 00:11:16,216
that is being used,

187
00:11:16,216 --> 00:11:18,447
primarily x-rays for our course.

188
00:11:18,447 --> 00:11:22,657
And it is 24 𝞪 particles,
but we are not considering imaging

189
00:11:22,657 --> 00:11:24,066
with 𝞪 particles.

190
00:11:24,066 --> 00:11:25,876
So we do not consider that,

191
00:11:25,876 --> 00:11:29,208
so the good news is equivalent dose
is equal to absorbed dose

192
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:31,027
for biomedical imaging.

193
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:36,687
That is the relationship that we have
for the types of x-rays that we use.

194
00:11:37,449 --> 00:11:40,598
And finally there's the third term,
that's the effective dose,

195
00:11:41,397 --> 00:11:43,947
and this is essentially
taking into account,

196
00:11:43,947 --> 00:11:48,994
once we have the equivalent dose
of our radiation,

197
00:11:48,994 --> 00:11:51,534
in our case is equal to the absorbed dose.

198
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:56,838
We have to correct this 
for the sensitivity of the tissue

199
00:11:56,838 --> 00:12:00,377
to the radiation.

200
00:12:00,377 --> 00:12:04,194
So we'll introduce here now
a tissue weighting factor,

201
00:12:04,194 --> 00:12:07,844
and so the equivalent dose--
it's given in sievert--

202
00:12:07,844 --> 00:12:13,704
is equal to the sum 
of the equivalent doses <i>H</i> here

203
00:12:13,715 --> 00:12:17,116
for the given tissue,
so how much is this tissue in sievert

204
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:20,905
exposed to the radiation,
and then we multiply it

205
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,905
by a weighting factor W𝖳.

206
00:12:22,905 --> 00:12:27,996
We'll have to do it over all the tissues
to get the total equivalent dose.

207
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:32,791
So we'll take this
for all types of tissues,

208
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:35,491
and here is a list 
of different tissues.

209
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:39,911
The tissue weighting factor, W𝖳,
for different tissues.

210
00:12:39,911 --> 00:12:42,194
And actually we find
for the gonads, it's very high.

211
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:44,799
For skin and bone surface,
it's very low,

212
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,387
and we have a number of organs 
where it's 0.05 and 0.12.

213
00:12:48,387 --> 00:12:52,387
Again, there are not huge differences
but there are differences

214
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:58,315
in terms of the sensitivity
of the tissue T--

215
00:12:58,315 --> 00:13:03,956
different tissues relative to the x-rays
they're being exposed to.
