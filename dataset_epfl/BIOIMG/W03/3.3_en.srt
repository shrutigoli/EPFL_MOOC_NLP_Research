1
00:00:04,257 --> 00:00:07,286
Now I'll come to the second part 
of the interaction with photons,

2
00:00:07,286 --> 00:00:09,570
and here we have 
two more effects to discuss,

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:12,397
that is the photoelectric effect, 
pair production,

4
00:00:12,397 --> 00:00:15,967
and we'll make a short summary 
of the effects.

5
00:00:16,537 --> 00:00:20,884
Now if we look at photoelectric effect,

6
00:00:20,884 --> 00:00:22,556
which I want to talk about first,

7
00:00:22,556 --> 00:00:24,674
then we have the incident x-ray.

8
00:00:24,674 --> 00:00:28,424
Now we're looking at the interaction 
with an inner shell electron,

9
00:00:28,424 --> 00:00:30,670
K shell or L shell electron,

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:36,668
and this point the incident x-ray 
is assumed to have sufficient energy

11
00:00:36,668 --> 00:00:40,847
that it can overcome the binding energy 
of the initial electron.

12
00:00:40,847 --> 00:00:45,817
This will eject it and therefore 
create a vacancy.

13
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:50,063
So the inner shell electron 
in this process is being removed.

14
00:00:50,063 --> 00:00:51,865
What now happens is,

15
00:00:51,865 --> 00:00:54,278
as we've discussed last time,

16
00:00:54,278 --> 00:00:56,456
we have now an excited atom;

17
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,664
we have a vacancy here at the K shell.

18
00:00:59,354 --> 00:01:02,044
This way you can see 
now the atom is excited,

19
00:01:02,215 --> 00:01:03,505
it's in a higher energy state,

20
00:01:03,505 --> 00:01:06,025
this vacancy is filled by 
an outer shell electron,

21
00:01:06,025 --> 00:01:08,764
which falls from the shell 
to the inner shell.

22
00:01:08,764 --> 00:01:11,695
Here in this graphic 
we have an L shell electron

23
00:01:11,695 --> 00:01:16,855
that falls into K shell, 
and as it falls down it liberates energy,

24
00:01:16,855 --> 00:01:22,755
it's binding energy, and therefore 
it releases a characteristic radiation.

25
00:01:22,755 --> 00:01:24,537
We have from the initial electron,

26
00:01:24,537 --> 00:01:27,576
we also have a photoelectron 
that's being produced,

27
00:01:27,576 --> 00:01:28,964
that's the...

28
00:01:31,116 --> 00:01:33,794
ejected electron.

29
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:36,785
So what we need is for this to happen

30
00:01:36,785 --> 00:01:40,737
obviously if the incident photon 
that comes in here

31
00:01:40,737 --> 00:01:42,187
does not have enough energy

32
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:44,578
to overcome the binding energy 
of the K shell electron,

33
00:01:44,578 --> 00:01:47,606
K shell electron will just say, 
"So what? I don't care.

34
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:50,006
I am not moving anywhere."

35
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:51,556
And nothing happens.

36
00:01:52,736 --> 00:01:56,988
This process will only happen 
if the energy of the incident x-ray

37
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:02,972
<i>Ei</i> is bigger than the ionizing energy 
of the electron here

38
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:05,079
for the K shell, the <i>IK</i>,

39
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:09,566
that's the binding energy 
of the K shell electron.

40
00:02:09,566 --> 00:02:13,342
So the incident energy should be equal to

41
00:02:13,342 --> 00:02:16,063
the energy of the electron afterwards,

42
00:02:16,063 --> 00:02:22,094
the photoelectron plus the binding energy 
of the electron that it has displaced.

43
00:02:22,957 --> 00:02:24,885
So that means in other words

44
00:02:24,885 --> 00:02:28,979
the binding energy of the electron-- 
this guy here--

45
00:02:28,979 --> 00:02:31,659
is equal to the incident photon energy

46
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:34,074
minus the binding energy.

47
00:02:34,984 --> 00:02:39,022
So to summarize, we have 
a vacancy in the K shell,

48
00:02:39,022 --> 00:02:40,754
this vacancy is filled

49
00:02:40,754 --> 00:02:45,554
with an electron from the outer shell.

50
00:02:45,554 --> 00:02:49,097
It could be the L shell like 
it is shown here in the graphic here.

51
00:02:49,097 --> 00:02:51,034
It could me the M shell.

52
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:53,253
If it is in the L shell then 
this will create a vacancy

53
00:02:53,253 --> 00:02:55,570
and the L shell will be filled 
by an electron,

54
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:58,110
for example, from the M shell, etc. etc.

55
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,606
So you could have a cascade 
of characteristic x-ray quanta

56
00:03:03,606 --> 00:03:07,384
that are being emitted in this process.

57
00:03:07,384 --> 00:03:12,124
We have also another process 
that we've discussed last time

58
00:03:12,124 --> 00:03:15,595
is the process of producing 
OJ electrons.

59
00:03:15,595 --> 00:03:17,438
This is in principle possible,

60
00:03:17,438 --> 00:03:19,819
but this is not so frequent in

61
00:03:21,729 --> 00:03:22,829
biological tissues,

62
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:28,060
where we have soft tissues with a low <i>zed</i>.

63
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:32,289
So the photoelectric effect is

64
00:03:32,289 --> 00:03:35,010
abruptly increased when the energy

65
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:40,849
is just above the binding energy 
of the electron,

66
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:44,869
and this gives rise to 
so called absorption edges.

67
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:47,741
The absorption edge increases with 𝚭,

68
00:03:47,741 --> 00:03:50,942
it is actually very low for Hydrogen, 
Carbon, Nitrogen, and Oxygen,

69
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:54,578
which are primary compounds of tissue.

70
00:03:55,968 --> 00:03:57,999
The absorption edge energy

71
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:01,800
is a reflection of the binding energy 
of the initial electrons,

72
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,560
and therefore as we've discussed last time

73
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,620
it makes perfect sense for Coulomb's law,

74
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,979
that this is proportion 
to the number of protons,

75
00:04:09,979 --> 00:04:14,340
which is therefore proportional 
to the atomic number 𝚭.

76
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:18,709
So here's a display of the mass 
continuation coefficient

77
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:20,479
as a function of x-ray energy.

78
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,720
We have two examples here: 
Barium and Iodine

79
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,350
with high 𝚭 and we can see here

80
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,121
the mass continuation 
coefficient decreases rapidly

81
00:04:29,121 --> 00:04:31,550
and then suddenly increases.

82
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,781
That is where suddenly the photon energy

83
00:04:33,781 --> 00:04:40,811
surpasses the K shell binding energy 
of either Barium or Iodine,

84
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:43,219
Iodine here and Barium here.

85
00:04:43,219 --> 00:04:46,410
For tissue we do not see 
those K shell edges

86
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:48,561
because the binding energies--

87
00:04:48,561 --> 00:04:53,566
the K shell binding energies 
are well below 10 kiloelectron volts.

88
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:57,425
So why do we have these edges increase,

89
00:04:57,875 --> 00:05:00,934
and then we have the effect increase?

90
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,846
Well basically the way to look at it is

91
00:05:02,846 --> 00:05:06,515
if the energy is only sufficient 
to ionize initial electrons

92
00:05:06,515 --> 00:05:13,248
that are more electrons than the photon
can interact with in the material

93
00:05:13,248 --> 00:05:14,735
and so if there are more electrons

94
00:05:14,735 --> 00:05:17,988
that are now potential candidates 
for interaction,

95
00:05:17,988 --> 00:05:22,826
then the attenuation coefficient 
discreetly increases.

96
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:26,557
Interestingly, the photoelectric effect

97
00:05:26,787 --> 00:05:30,290
is what Albert Einstein received 
his Nobel Prize for.

98
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:34,690
It was not the Einstein-Stokes
relationship for diffusion,

99
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,329
and it wasn't special relativity,

100
00:05:36,329 --> 00:05:37,858
it was the photoelectric effect

101
00:05:37,858 --> 00:05:42,619
that he was awarded 
the Nobel Prize for in 1921.

102
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:46,628
So now the fourth effect 
that I want to discuss,

103
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:49,448
for completeness sake, is pair production.

104
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:51,467
Pair production happens

105
00:05:51,467 --> 00:05:56,879
when the photon energy is bigger than 
twice the rest energy of the electron.

106
00:05:56,879 --> 00:06:01,978
In case that photon interacts 
with the electric field of the nucleus

107
00:06:01,978 --> 00:06:07,318
then it can disintegrate and produce 
an electron positron pair.

108
00:06:07,318 --> 00:06:08,399
So It produces an electron

109
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,628
and it's at the matter equivalent 
of a positron.

110
00:06:12,798 --> 00:06:15,880
The kinetic energy 
of the produced particles, <i>E</i>

111
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,668
is equal to the photon energy

112
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,958
minus the rest energy of the two--

113
00:06:21,718 --> 00:06:23,869
of the electron and positron combined.

114
00:06:24,191 --> 00:06:28,700
They have the same mass so 
it's two times the mass of the electron.

115
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:31,690
Here's an illustration 
in a Wilson cloud chamber.

116
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,300
So we have an incident photon,

117
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,918
it's in a magnetic field that produces

118
00:06:34,918 --> 00:06:40,570
a positron here 
and an electron on this side.

119
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:44,701
Now this effect is not important 
in bio-imaging.

120
00:06:44,942 --> 00:06:46,392
Why is this so?

121
00:06:48,652 --> 00:06:50,511
Well, we have to look 
at the photon energies

122
00:06:50,641 --> 00:06:52,443
that are being used in bio-imaging,

123
00:06:52,443 --> 00:06:54,231
and as you will see the energies

124
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:57,546
that are being used in x-ray imaging are

125
00:06:57,878 --> 00:07:03,058
well below the 1 mega-electron volt 
required for pair production.

126
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:10,328
Pair production effect 
is not important in tissue.

127
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:16,967
So here I want to summarize 
the interactions.

128
00:07:16,967 --> 00:07:19,000
We'll start with coherent scattering,

129
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,878
that is Rayleigh scattering.

130
00:07:20,878 --> 00:07:24,107
We have the photon,

131
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:26,467
the way the light is being deflected,

132
00:07:26,467 --> 00:07:29,098
but it retains the same wavelength,

133
00:07:29,098 --> 00:07:33,807
therefore in this animation 
the color does not change.

134
00:07:34,189 --> 00:07:35,597
Then we have the Compton effect

135
00:07:35,597 --> 00:07:37,307
which happens on the outer shell.

136
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:40,397
An electron is being liberated,

137
00:07:40,397 --> 00:07:43,628
and it's ionizing and the photon changes 
it's wavelength

138
00:07:43,628 --> 00:07:46,972
as you can see with the change in color.

139
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:51,902
Then we have the effect 
of the photoelectric effect,

140
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:55,853
in this case the photon

141
00:07:55,853 --> 00:07:58,654
is being absorbed by the inner shell,

142
00:07:58,654 --> 00:08:01,622
electron inner shell, 
it is completely absorbed.

143
00:08:01,622 --> 00:08:07,083
There is an inner shell electron 
is being liberated

144
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,561
and then we have the cascading event

145
00:08:09,561 --> 00:08:11,903
from an outer shell electron
filling the vacancy

146
00:08:11,903 --> 00:08:16,883
in the inner shell and thereby 
releasing the characteristic x-ray

147
00:08:17,703 --> 00:08:19,570
for this particular atom.

148
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,229
And finally, pair production,

149
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:27,260
the photon interacts 
with the electric field in the nucleus,

150
00:08:27,825 --> 00:08:33,385
and it produces a positron 
electron pair as a result.

151
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:37,548
So to summarize, if we look now here 
and the tissue

152
00:08:37,548 --> 00:08:39,797
we have the linear attenuation
coefficient <i>mu</i>

153
00:08:39,797 --> 00:08:42,207
as a function of the photon energy

154
00:08:42,207 --> 00:08:43,847
here on the X axis.

155
00:08:43,847 --> 00:08:47,156
Notice that both scales are logarithmic,

156
00:08:47,156 --> 00:08:49,666
and if you look at these two, 
at this graph here,

157
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:51,299
this is a total absorption

158
00:08:51,299 --> 00:08:53,649
and then these here are 
the different contributions.

159
00:08:53,649 --> 00:08:56,236
Rayleigh falls are fast.

160
00:08:56,236 --> 00:08:58,006
We have the photoelectric effect,

161
00:08:58,006 --> 00:09:00,330
which falls off also very fast.

162
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:03,666
Compton effect has a relatively 
smooth dependence

163
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:06,156
and here pair production 
only starts to happen

164
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:09,037
here at above 8 mega-electron volt.

165
00:09:09,468 --> 00:09:12,868
Now what are typical energies 
that we are dealing with

166
00:09:12,868 --> 00:09:16,448
for CT and SPECT, which we will discuss 
in the next two weeks.

167
00:09:16,448 --> 00:09:18,968
We are in the range 
of 30 kiloelectron volts

168
00:09:18,968 --> 00:09:21,167
to around 150 kiloelectron volts.

169
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,148
So this is roughly the range 
for CT and SPECT

170
00:09:25,258 --> 00:09:27,250
and for positron emission tomography,

171
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,210
which happens at 511 kiloelectron volts.

172
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:31,651
We are here at this range.

173
00:09:31,651 --> 00:09:33,161
We're far from pair production

174
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:35,401
and we are at a point 
where Rayleigh scattering

175
00:09:35,401 --> 00:09:38,756
is really not much of a contributor.

176
00:09:38,884 --> 00:09:40,944
So in reality, to understand

177
00:09:43,274 --> 00:09:45,733
the absorption in tissue we really need

178
00:09:45,863 --> 00:09:48,378
to just concentrate 
on photoelectric effect

179
00:09:48,378 --> 00:09:50,615
and on the Compton effect.
