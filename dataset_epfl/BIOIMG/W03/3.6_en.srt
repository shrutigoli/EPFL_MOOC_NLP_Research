1
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:09,802
So now that we have discussed 
the effects of x-ray,

2
00:00:09,802 --> 00:00:12,642
of ionizing radiation on our tissues,

3
00:00:12,642 --> 00:00:16,613
we've discussed 
the possible repair mechanisms

4
00:00:16,613 --> 00:00:19,795
and how we quantify the radiation.

5
00:00:19,795 --> 00:00:25,720
Now comes the question, how do we 
protect ourselves against x-rays.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,361
And I want to do this here

7
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,841
as a general primer 
of radiation protection.

8
00:00:29,841 --> 00:00:34,297
It by no means replaces
a regular radiation protection course.

9
00:00:34,297 --> 00:00:36,624
But it gives you the basic principles

10
00:00:36,624 --> 00:00:39,004
and the governing principles 
that are behind it.

11
00:00:39,004 --> 00:00:44,404
And as you will see,
they are fairly easy to understand.

12
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,866
So the absorbed dose depends 
on the intensity of the radiation,

13
00:00:50,866 --> 00:00:54,255
and the activity here is given,
that's a term that is useful to know,

14
00:00:54,255 --> 00:00:55,305
is given in becquerel.

15
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:58,095
And a becquerel is very simple
it's 1 decay per second.

16
00:00:58,595 --> 00:01:03,656
So instead of saying 1 decay per second,
it was decided to call it 1 becquerel.

17
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:07,336
So for radioactive materials, 
we typically in SI units

18
00:01:07,336 --> 00:01:09,519
express it in becquerel.

19
00:01:10,656 --> 00:01:13,709
And now we have three basic elements 
of radioprotection.

20
00:01:13,709 --> 00:01:15,452
Number one is time.

21
00:01:16,008 --> 00:01:19,144
Don't be exposed to it
for a long time.

22
00:01:19,993 --> 00:01:24,317
In practice for biomedical imaging
the term that has been used is occupancy.

23
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:27,104
And occupancy is basically,
we take a room

24
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:31,751
and we calculate what percentage 
of time of a working day

25
00:01:31,751 --> 00:01:33,841
do you spend in that room?

26
00:01:33,841 --> 00:01:36,828
So if your office is next
to an x-ray imaging device

27
00:01:36,828 --> 00:01:40,860
your occupancy is, you roughly work
eight hours per day in that room,

28
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:43,450
your occupancy will be close to 100%.

29
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,845
If it's a corridor where you pass through
once a day for example,

30
00:01:46,845 --> 00:01:49,239
your occupancy is 
essentially something like

31
00:01:49,239 --> 00:01:53,499
20 seconds divided by 8 hours 
times 60 seconds.

32
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:55,756
So it is very small.

33
00:01:56,613 --> 00:02:01,210
So for corridors, we have 
less considerations to do,

34
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:03,993
because you walk through there,
your exposure--

35
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:08,003
remember the exposure is 
determined by the absorbed dose

36
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:11,439
and the absorbed dose is number of--
is the energy per kilogram

37
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:13,583
deposited in your body.

38
00:02:15,088 --> 00:02:17,388
The second factor is distance.

39
00:02:17,392 --> 00:02:20,453
The further away you are,
the less exposed you are

40
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:22,537
to the radiation.

41
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:25,552
We have an object that releases
a certain number of becquerel,

42
00:02:25,552 --> 00:02:28,833
of decays, of events.

43
00:02:28,833 --> 00:02:31,342
It does that in all sorts of directions.

44
00:02:31,342 --> 00:02:35,078
The radioactivity doesn't know
in which direction to go.

45
00:02:35,078 --> 00:02:38,005
And so the radiation
that our body absorbs

46
00:02:38,005 --> 00:02:43,036
is proportional to the fraction
of the solid angle that we occupy.

47
00:02:43,547 --> 00:02:47,117
So in other words, 
we have the fraction,

48
00:02:47,117 --> 00:02:51,627
we can express it 
as the surface of a sphere,

49
00:02:51,627 --> 00:02:54,872
with the radius of the distance
between us and the source

50
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:57,052
and our surface area.

51
00:02:57,842 --> 00:03:01,939
So in other words, the received radiation
that our body receives

52
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:04,817
is proportional 
to the intensity of the object,

53
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,857
the intensity of the source 
in becquerel, <i>𝚰o</i>

54
00:03:07,857 --> 00:03:09,663
divided by the distance squared.

55
00:03:09,663 --> 00:03:13,222
So the further away 
we are, the better.

56
00:03:13,622 --> 00:03:16,211
So as a reminder here, 
it's a solid angle on a sphere;

57
00:03:16,211 --> 00:03:18,468
it's <i>4𝛑</i> for a unit's sphere.

58
00:03:18,468 --> 00:03:23,411
The surface area that we occupy,
we as a human being, is fixed.

59
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:26,001
We do not change our surface
if we go further away.

60
00:03:26,001 --> 00:03:30,357
So the fraction of the solid angle,
the total solid angle that we occupy

61
00:03:30,357 --> 00:03:32,958
decreases with 1 over <i>d</i> squared.

62
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:35,118
So that's the second element.

63
00:03:35,118 --> 00:03:37,306
Don't be exposed to it
for a long time.

64
00:03:38,636 --> 00:03:41,203
Stay away from it
as long as you can.

65
00:03:41,203 --> 00:03:44,222
But there, the distance,
if you double the distance,

66
00:03:44,222 --> 00:03:47,611
you have a quarter of the radiation 
that you're exposed to.

67
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:51,083
So if you have radioactive sample 
in your hand, hold it like this,

68
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,222
as compared to this,

69
00:03:52,222 --> 00:03:54,531
and this mark is already 
a tenth of the radiation

70
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:57,111
that you're exposed to, roughly.

71
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,473
And the final element is shielding.

72
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:02,363
So if you cannot avoid
being exposed to it,

73
00:04:02,363 --> 00:04:04,723
you're going to have
a long exposure,

74
00:04:05,373 --> 00:04:08,162
if you cannot get away from it,
then use shieldings.

75
00:04:08,162 --> 00:04:11,131
So we use shielding
in certain x-ray procedures

76
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:17,030
to shield the parts of the body
that are not subjected to the procedure.

77
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:20,813
Now for shielding, 
we can have lead,

78
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:24,870
we can have iron,
we can have concrete,

79
00:04:24,870 --> 00:04:25,822
and water.

80
00:04:25,822 --> 00:04:34,541
And the thicknesses that you see here
is the measure of the thickness needed

81
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:39,146
to produce a ten-fold reduction
in x-ray exposure.

82
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:45,571
So we have for lead, a ten-fold reduction
is achieved for 5 centimeters of lead.

83
00:04:45,571 --> 00:04:47,529
Iron we need 10 centimeters.

84
00:04:47,529 --> 00:04:51,389
Concrete, 20, and if it's water,
we need 1 liter of water

85
00:04:51,389 --> 00:04:54,098
to produce the same effect.

86
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:59,275
So we have different 
materials at our hands.

87
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:03,359
This depends on the energy
and type of radiation.

88
00:05:04,149 --> 00:05:08,320
So to give a sense
of the half value layers,

89
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,050
here is the number for materials.

90
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:14,065
Iron or steel is close to 2 centimeters,
bricks are 5 centimeters,

91
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:19,180
concrete, 6, dirt 8,
ice, 17 centimeters,

92
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,810
soft wood, 22 centimeters,

93
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:25,450
and snow, in our area 
if that's of interest, 52 centimeters.

94
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:30,125
So an increased half-value layer
means a decreased efficiency

95
00:05:30,125 --> 00:05:32,618
as a shielding material.

96
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:37,063
Now we have to consider
the different types of radiation

97
00:05:37,063 --> 00:05:40,368
as I will illustrate in shortly.

98
00:05:40,368 --> 00:05:42,562
We cannot just assume,
well, we've got our radiation

99
00:05:42,562 --> 00:05:45,914
and we will just take
one type of shielding.

100
00:05:45,914 --> 00:05:48,950
We have to consider 
what kind of source it is.

101
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:52,780
Here are alpha emissions,
beta emissions, gamma emissions--

102
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:58,803
the different ways of shielding
these different radiations.

103
00:05:58,803 --> 00:06:02,321
And here I wanted to illustrate this
with beta emitters.

104
00:06:02,321 --> 00:06:04,278
like C14 or tritium.

105
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:07,780
They do not penetrate
low <i>Z</i> material.

106
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,189
So the shielding that one should use
if one has beta emitters

107
00:06:11,189 --> 00:06:14,330
should be plastic or glass,

108
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,041
the low <i>Z</i> material
so that we avoid Bremsstrahlung,

109
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:21,259
We have a minimum
in Bremsstrahlung in there.

110
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:25,671
If we have high energy beta emitters
such as phosphorus-32,

111
00:06:25,671 --> 00:06:28,899
this is used for DNA labeling for example.

112
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:31,985
Then what you do is first,
you have a low <i>Z</i> shielding,

113
00:06:31,985 --> 00:06:36,478
so you try to-- the electrons--

114
00:06:37,318 --> 00:06:39,458
the beta emitters, 
that's are our electrons,

115
00:06:39,458 --> 00:06:43,379
they have to lose their energy,
so you want to use low <i>Z</i> shielding

116
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:47,091
and then complement this
with lead shielding

117
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:54,375
because as these high energy beta emitters
are losing their energy in the plastic,

118
00:06:56,515 --> 00:06:59,573
they are producing Bremsstrahlung
which are then x-rays.

119
00:06:59,573 --> 00:07:03,237
So you're transforming beta
and make those into gamma emitters

120
00:07:03,237 --> 00:07:07,419
in this process, so you need to think 
of using lead there as well.

121
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:12,534
So our take home message,
it does depend on the type of radiation.

122
00:07:13,474 --> 00:07:18,784
And now we will demonstrate 
a few of the sources

123
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:26,919
and also some rather surprising presence
of radioactivity in our environment.

124
00:07:29,577 --> 00:07:32,699
Okay, so we will first
demonstrate the effectiveness

125
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:37,018
of certain material 
to eliminate radioactivity.

126
00:07:37,018 --> 00:07:39,540
This is strontium,
a beta emitter.

127
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,771
You can hear from the sound
how active it is.

128
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:43,725
Now I'll put the paraffin 
block in-between.

129
00:07:43,725 --> 00:07:47,208
And here the paraffin block
is a perfect way to eliminate

130
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,528
the beta emissions.

131
00:07:48,528 --> 00:07:51,828
If you take plastic here,
also this plastic is fairly good.

132
00:07:52,418 --> 00:07:56,179
On the other hand, aluminum,
even though high <i>Z</i> material,

133
00:07:56,179 --> 00:08:02,397
it's not very good at stopping
this radioactivity from strontium.

134
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:04,921
Now we'll take americium.

135
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:12,545
This has a lower activity
and we can hear the sound.

136
00:08:13,254 --> 00:08:16,102
If we listen to the frequency 
of the sound that gives us the counts

137
00:08:16,102 --> 00:08:18,580
of the particles that are detected.

138
00:08:19,428 --> 00:08:21,611
And I'll put the plastic in-between.

139
00:08:21,611 --> 00:08:26,707
And this source is not 
effectively blocked by plastic.

140
00:08:26,707 --> 00:08:32,024
On the other hand, if I use lead,
then we can eliminate the source

141
00:08:32,024 --> 00:08:34,863
of radioactivity here
to a large extent.

142
00:08:39,278 --> 00:08:43,798
We have in older watches, the hands 
that makes them glow in the dark

143
00:08:43,798 --> 00:08:44,923
is made by radium.

144
00:08:44,923 --> 00:08:46,497
Radium is radioactive.

145
00:08:46,497 --> 00:08:49,847
And here you can hear it,
these are the hands of the watches.

146
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,595
Some old watches, 
they should not be being sold

147
00:08:53,595 --> 00:08:56,435
or being in use today, 
but this is an illustration.

148
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:58,907
We'll find radioactivity
actually in very surprising places.

149
00:08:58,907 --> 00:09:01,574
And this is for those 
of you who do camping.

150
00:09:01,574 --> 00:09:04,176
These are the things
that you light on.

151
00:09:05,456 --> 00:09:08,857
And as you can see from the activity,
this is radioactive.

152
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:11,233
There is radioactive material used.

153
00:09:11,768 --> 00:09:15,500
There's of course, more nasty materials
that are being used such a polonium

154
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:19,203
in fire detectors
and the old CRT TVs.

155
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:25,127
So finally, to put all this 
into perspective,

156
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:27,592
the radiation exposures
we have in biomedical imaging.

157
00:09:27,592 --> 00:09:32,653
It will be useful to have some idea
what are typical radiation exposures.

158
00:09:32,653 --> 00:09:37,815
So we have taken here some tables
of first, some natural radiation.

159
00:09:37,815 --> 00:09:43,528
We have radon, typically in our basements
in rocky environments.

160
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:46,206
They're expressed here
in millirem per year

161
00:09:46,206 --> 00:09:48,025
and millisievert per year.

162
00:09:48,653 --> 00:09:52,106
Radon is by far the biggest source
of natural radiation.

163
00:09:52,106 --> 00:09:55,949
We have cosmic radiation, 
8% terrestrial radiation,

164
00:09:55,949 --> 00:09:58,676
and then we also have
some internal sources.

165
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:04,922
Very often, the usage 
of units is not uniform.

166
00:10:04,922 --> 00:10:07,496
We have roentgen equivalent man or REM.

167
00:10:07,496 --> 00:10:10,155
And a 100 roentgen equivalent man
is 1 sievert.

168
00:10:10,155 --> 00:10:15,032
Sievert is the official SI unit
for quantifying radiation.

169
00:10:16,396 --> 00:10:18,785
Then we have artificial sources.

170
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:22,335
We have here an example
of medical x-ray.

171
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,775
This is in millirem per year
and this is in sievert,

172
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:26,929
millisiervert per year,

173
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:30,037
nuclear medicine
and consumer products.

174
00:10:30,037 --> 00:10:31,995
That is a contribution.

175
00:10:31,995 --> 00:10:35,970
So we have artificial exposure,
natural exposure.

176
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:40,176
By far the most exposure
that we are exposed to is

177
00:10:40,176 --> 00:10:42,509
the natural sources.

178
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:49,147
Now if you look 
at occupational other sources,

179
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:53,637
we have occupational radioactivity.
We have the nuclear fuel cycle.

180
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:58,619
We have nuclear fallout 
from surface testing of atomic bombs.

181
00:10:58,619 --> 00:11:01,615
We can measure the radioactivity,
the consequences of these tests

182
00:11:01,615 --> 00:11:06,405
done by the various countries,
predominantly in the 60s.

183
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:09,476
These effects, although 
they can be quantified,

184
00:11:09,476 --> 00:11:11,334
they are very low.

185
00:11:11,334 --> 00:11:15,907
They are less than a millirem 
per year here in this column.

186
00:11:17,943 --> 00:11:20,293
To give you another idea,
sources of exposure.

187
00:11:20,293 --> 00:11:22,688
So in the old days when we had--

188
00:11:22,688 --> 00:11:27,517
maybe you still have 
an old CRT computer monitor or TV,

189
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:29,447
that is where the electrons 
are accelerated,

190
00:11:29,447 --> 00:11:31,361
and they produce
the image on the screen,

191
00:11:31,361 --> 00:11:33,527
the big, thick TV screens.

192
00:11:34,167 --> 00:11:37,606
These TV sets, at three centimeters
from that TV set,

193
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:41,646
you're exposed to 1/2 millirem 
per hour of radiation.

194
00:11:41,646 --> 00:11:44,431
Thus we have electrons
that impact on the surface.

195
00:11:45,547 --> 00:11:48,710
If you're in an airplane
at 12 kilometers height,

196
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:52,483
then you're exposed
to roughly the same radioactivity.

197
00:11:52,483 --> 00:11:55,045
It's a 1/2 millirem per hour.

198
00:11:56,218 --> 00:11:59,224
We have radionuclides in the body,
for example, postassium,

199
00:11:59,224 --> 00:12:01,264
for example, from bananas.

200
00:12:01,264 --> 00:12:05,784
There's a lot of potassium,
so that's 39 millirem per year.

201
00:12:07,174 --> 00:12:13,740
So we compare this radioactivity with-- 
this is primarily potassium here,

202
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:14,660
this source.

203
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,420
You can compare these numbers here,
with these numbers here

204
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:19,291
and do the calculation.

205
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:21,711
We have concrete
that has radioactivity in there.

206
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:24,964
We have some radioactivity 
in drinking water.

207
00:12:24,964 --> 00:12:28,547
If-- I presume nobody owns 
these watches anymore,

208
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:30,726
I had one from my grandfather.

209
00:12:31,686 --> 00:12:36,282
The old pocket watches
had the hands that glow in the dark

210
00:12:36,282 --> 00:12:39,217
this was done with radium
and there you would be exposed

211
00:12:39,217 --> 00:12:42,726
to six millirem per year
of radioactivity.

212
00:12:43,156 --> 00:12:47,003
Very often eye glasses contain thorium
for whatever reason.

213
00:12:47,453 --> 00:12:50,652
There you're exposed
to 6 to 11 millirem per year.

214
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:53,515
And if you take 
a trans-Atlantic round trip,

215
00:12:54,745 --> 00:13:01,816
then you're roughly taking up
a radioactivity of 5 millirem.

216
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,864
Now compare this to medical procedures:
chest x-ray, dental x-ray, head and neck.

217
00:13:09,864 --> 00:13:12,624
We're up around 5 to 20 millirem.

218
00:13:12,624 --> 00:13:16,668
Lumbar spinal x-rays,
pelvic x-rays and hip x-rays,

219
00:13:16,668 --> 00:13:19,408
they're on the order 
of 50 to 100 millirem.

220
00:13:19,408 --> 00:13:22,743
And if you do a CT scan
of head and body,

221
00:13:22,743 --> 00:13:27,483
then you're exposed 
to 1.1 rem of radiation.

222
00:13:27,483 --> 00:13:31,896
So that is quite a bit,
and that is one of the reasons why

223
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:37,964
we cannot put too many x-ray procedures 
on the same patient per year.

224
00:13:38,441 --> 00:13:42,543
It's interesting to note 
that these are sort of general tables

225
00:13:42,543 --> 00:13:49,350
I felt was useful to illustrate 
the different dosages here.

226
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:54,533
We have some compounds
that are quite dangerous

227
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,991
but they are used.

228
00:13:55,991 --> 00:13:58,573
If you might remember 
a few years back,

229
00:13:58,573 --> 00:14:01,216
it is now believed that it was 
the Russian Secret Service

230
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:05,841
that poisoned this former agent 
of theirs in the UK with polonium.

231
00:14:05,841 --> 00:14:09,103
So they got him to swallow something 
that contained the polonium

232
00:14:09,103 --> 00:14:11,104
and he died of the radiation damage.

233
00:14:11,104 --> 00:14:14,193
Polonium is a very nasty substance.

234
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:18,661
It releases very high 
energetic beta particles.

235
00:14:18,661 --> 00:14:20,083
It gets warm.

236
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:25,410
But you do have polonium in,
for example, some smoke detectors.

237
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,920
They're being used there
and on the older CRT screens,

238
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:35,762
the old TV sets, it was used
as an anti-ionizing agent

239
00:14:35,762 --> 00:14:41,200
to prevent [char] from building up 
on the surface of the TV set.

240
00:14:41,983 --> 00:14:44,567
So these are some examples.

241
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:48,067
A more recent example of where 
we have to deal with these terms here

242
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:53,185
like millirem or sievert,
were the tragic events that surrounded

243
00:14:53,185 --> 00:14:58,564
the catastrophe of Fukushima
in recent years.

244
00:15:00,145 --> 00:15:03,765
And here are some links
that you can look at.

245
00:15:04,935 --> 00:15:12,338
This is where you can calculate
the dosage for certain exposures

246
00:15:12,338 --> 00:15:14,503
if you're interested in doing so.
