1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,540
For today, I would like to start
with a few examples

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:12,830
to show you what kind of images
one can obtain with x-ray imaging.

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:16,481
Let's start with the first image,
and this is a transgenic mouse;

4
00:00:16,481 --> 00:00:19,810
a fairly general x-ray image.

5
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:24,272
We can see here absorption
throughout the body

6
00:00:24,272 --> 00:00:29,222
and we can also discern the legs
of the mouse.

7
00:00:30,462 --> 00:00:35,683
However, if one selects only the areas
that have high absorbance of x-rays,

8
00:00:35,683 --> 00:00:37,433
then we can see a very nice,

9
00:00:37,433 --> 00:00:40,943
a very high resolution skeleton here
of this transgenic mouse

10
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:42,656
with the features.

11
00:00:42,656 --> 00:00:47,816
There's the tail, the legs,
the rib cage, at very high resolution.

12
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:52,147
Insects are also a good target
for x-ray imaging;

13
00:00:52,147 --> 00:00:55,926
there's excellent contrast with the air,
even though there's not much mass.

14
00:00:55,926 --> 00:00:57,847
Here you can see a mosquito.

15
00:00:57,847 --> 00:01:01,736
Here is the head, the antennas,
and the legs.

16
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:05,417
Now, mosquitoes transmit a disease,
and that is malaria.

17
00:01:05,501 --> 00:01:10,684
And we have here the blood cell image
with x-rays, color coded,

18
00:01:10,684 --> 00:01:12,642
pseudo color coded.

19
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:15,315
A normal red blood cell

20
00:01:15,413 --> 00:01:21,833
as it goes through different stages
of the transfection with malaria,

21
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:23,934
with the malaria parasite.

22
00:01:25,348 --> 00:01:28,838
With x-rays, one can even go 
to cellular resolution.

23
00:01:28,838 --> 00:01:31,619
Here is the H1N1 virus.

24
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,869
We see this is a single cell organism,

25
00:01:34,869 --> 00:01:36,679
we can see inside the structure,

26
00:01:36,679 --> 00:01:38,509
and we can see even at the surface,

27
00:01:38,509 --> 00:01:45,048
the surface antennas 
with which the virus propagates itself.

28
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,280
Now, what do we need for bio imaging?

29
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,910
What is essential for bio imaging?

30
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:55,340
Here, it is contrast.

31
00:01:55,712 --> 00:01:58,278
Now, how do we generate contrast
with x-rays?

32
00:01:58,323 --> 00:01:59,594
Remember with x-rays--

33
00:01:59,594 --> 00:02:02,462
we discussed last time 
the generation of x-rays--

34
00:02:02,462 --> 00:02:08,483
we bombard our living being 
or object with x-rays.

35
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:12,532
And so, what we need 
for generating contrast

36
00:02:12,636 --> 00:02:15,065
is absorption of x-rays.

37
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:17,693
It's the absorption that generates
the contrast.

38
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:20,685
If we don't have absorption,
we'll get the original intensity,

39
00:02:20,685 --> 00:02:23,345
and we will know nothing about our object.

40
00:02:23,564 --> 00:02:27,804
So clearly, absorption is key here,
and this is the mechanism,

41
00:02:27,804 --> 00:02:33,113
the primary mechanism 
that produces contrast for x-ray imaging.

42
00:02:33,113 --> 00:02:38,851
And this will be the subject 
of today's lecture, of this week's lecture sets,

43
00:02:40,027 --> 00:02:45,264
what mechanisms produce absorption
of [contrast] of x-rays.

44
00:02:47,029 --> 00:02:50,643
So how can we describe
the attenuation of x-rays?

45
00:02:50,643 --> 00:02:53,796
We'll just go 
with an empirical demonstration here.

46
00:02:55,506 --> 00:02:58,670
Aside from that the photon 
might just pass through our object,

47
00:02:58,838 --> 00:03:01,339
what are other fates 
that the photon can have?

48
00:03:01,339 --> 00:03:02,980
It can be absorbed.

49
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:06,610
It would transfer its energy 
to the lattice, to the tissue,

50
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:08,329
or it can be scattered.

51
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:09,808
And if it is scattered,

52
00:03:09,808 --> 00:03:12,426
by means that we will discuss
next week,

53
00:03:12,426 --> 00:03:16,567
we will not be detecting 
a scattered photon.

54
00:03:17,491 --> 00:03:19,226
Let's take a situation here

55
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:24,462
where we have a tissue layer 
of thickness <i>Δx</i> here,

56
00:03:24,762 --> 00:03:26,931
we have <i>n</i> photons incident.

57
00:03:26,931 --> 00:03:30,981
<i>n</i> can be for example a 1000,
10,000, some number here.

58
00:03:31,621 --> 00:03:35,922
They pass through this layer of tissue
of thickness Δx,

59
00:03:35,922 --> 00:03:42,651
and after, we have <i>n - Δn</i> photons
that continue the trajectory.

60
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,242
Now, the photons are removed
according to Probability Law.

61
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:54,142
If we look at the number of photons
that are being absorbed or scattered

62
00:03:54,142 --> 00:03:58,893
in a layer of thickness <i>Δx</i>,
we'll call this number <i>Δn</i>.

63
00:03:59,892 --> 00:04:03,612
And this is given by this empirical law

64
00:04:03,612 --> 00:04:05,723
that the number of photons, <i>Δn</i> --

65
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:07,993
it's negative because they're being removed--

66
00:04:09,413 --> 00:04:14,743
it's proportional to the number 
of incident photons,

67
00:04:14,743 --> 00:04:16,033
that's the Probability Law.

68
00:04:16,033 --> 00:04:18,580
So, if you have a 1000 photons,
we remove 10%,

69
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,493
we have 100 photons removed,

70
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,182
We have 10,000 photons,
with 10% removal,

71
00:04:23,182 --> 00:04:28,314
we will have a 1000 photons removed.

72
00:04:29,413 --> 00:04:31,664
The probability that they're being removed

73
00:04:31,664 --> 00:04:33,478
is proportional 
to the thickness of the layer

74
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:36,249
that also makes sense--
the probability that a photon

75
00:04:36,249 --> 00:04:38,664
is either absorbed
or scattered would increase

76
00:04:38,664 --> 00:04:42,825
as the number of the thickness 
of the tissue increases.

77
00:04:42,928 --> 00:04:45,967
That's the <i>Δx</i> here in this expression.

78
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:49,149
And then we have 
a proportionality constant,

79
00:04:49,149 --> 00:04:54,442
this <i>µ</i> here which is an empirical constant
that reflects the makeup of the tissue.

80
00:04:54,512 --> 00:04:58,608
And this µ is called 
the linear attenuation coefficient.

81
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:03,663
It has units 1 of a centimeter,
at which they are typically displayed.

82
00:05:05,084 --> 00:05:07,359
And it's called the linear
attenuation coefficient;

83
00:05:07,359 --> 00:05:09,988
linear is because of this equation here,

84
00:05:09,988 --> 00:05:12,159
that the probability law stipulates

85
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:15,459
that the number of photons removed
is proportional

86
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:19,329
to number of incident photons 
and thickness of the tissue layer.

87
00:05:20,685 --> 00:05:22,284
Now in reality,

88
00:05:22,284 --> 00:05:26,266
and this will be the subject
of today's lectures is

89
00:05:26,266 --> 00:05:27,899
that this linear attenuation coefficient

90
00:05:27,899 --> 00:05:31,700
is a function of the energy 
of the photon in µ.

91
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:35,831
It's a function 
of the atomic number, <i>Z</i>,

92
00:05:35,831 --> 00:05:40,217
and it's a function 
of the electron density, <i>ρ</i>.

93
00:05:40,217 --> 00:05:43,531
So now we will pretend
that we take this situation here,

94
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:45,401
and we'll pretend that this <i>Δx</i>,

95
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,901
we can assume it's a centimeter,

96
00:05:47,901 --> 00:05:51,808
we'll let it go to very small values,
that's a millimeter,

97
00:05:51,808 --> 00:05:54,592
then a micrometer, then a nanometer.

98
00:05:54,592 --> 00:05:56,312
It'll now make it very thin,

99
00:05:56,312 --> 00:06:01,571
so we'll mathematically 
we'll let <i>Δx</i> go to 0,

100
00:06:01,571 --> 00:06:05,452
and we'll have the number of photons
that are being observed

101
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:10,242
as a function of distance x,
as they pass through the tissue.

102
00:06:11,262 --> 00:06:16,622
So if we do that, then we can replace
the difference in photons.

103
00:06:17,222 --> 00:06:19,884
This equation here
with infinitesimal equations.

104
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:23,183
<i>Δn</i> will go to 0, 
so it will be <i>dn infinitesimal,</i>

105
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:29,949
Δx will go to 0,
so it will be replaced by the term <i>dx</i>,

106
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,140
and we will obtain now 
the differential equation

107
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:35,300
that the derivative 
of the number of photons

108
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:38,580
as a function of position is equals to <i>-µ</i>

109
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,040
times the number of photons
at that position.

110
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,010
That's a first order...
that's a differential equation.

111
00:06:45,521 --> 00:06:46,792
We know the solution,

112
00:06:46,792 --> 00:06:50,984
the derivative of a function 
equals to the function times the constant,

113
00:06:50,984 --> 00:06:56,236
and the solution is therefore simply given
by the exponent law.

114
00:06:56,396 --> 00:06:57,886
So, the number of photons

115
00:06:57,886 --> 00:07:01,545
after having passed through a tissue
at position x,

116
00:07:01,545 --> 00:07:04,055
is equal to the incident photons and zero,

117
00:07:04,055 --> 00:07:08,676
that's the number of photons that arrived
from the outside on our object,

118
00:07:08,676 --> 00:07:11,452
time <i>e</i> to the <i>- µ x</i>.

119
00:07:12,548 --> 00:07:16,759
In this solution, we have assumed 
that the linear attenuation coefficient

120
00:07:16,802 --> 00:07:21,731
is a function of position 
to get this simple solution.

121
00:07:21,731 --> 00:07:23,842
This is a simplification 
but this illustrates

122
00:07:23,842 --> 00:07:30,142
how we get from the linear law 
to an exponential law of photon density.

123
00:07:31,872 --> 00:07:34,782
Now, the linear attenuation coefficient,
as I mentioned here,

124
00:07:34,782 --> 00:07:37,062
is given in 1 of a centimeters,

125
00:07:37,062 --> 00:07:40,963
and that's the unit
that's not very intuitive.

126
00:07:40,963 --> 00:07:44,684
And so we use very often
the half-value layer

127
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:48,164
to describe the attenuation of a tissue.

128
00:07:48,164 --> 00:07:50,044
And the half-value layer
is essentially defined

129
00:07:50,044 --> 00:07:54,994
as the thickness of material
that passes one half of the photons.

130
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:57,914
So at the number of photons at <i>x</i>

131
00:07:57,914 --> 00:08:01,854
equals to the half-value layer 
of thickness, x(HVL),

132
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:05,475
is equal to the incident photons
and zero divided by two.

133
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:07,235
Half of the photons go through,

134
00:08:07,235 --> 00:08:12,014
and we can verify that by plugging this
into the above equation.

135
00:08:12,014 --> 00:08:15,305
Here, we plug this in, 
this relationship here,

136
00:08:15,305 --> 00:08:17,375
we find this relationship

137
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:20,954
and the solution of that
is at the half value layer

138
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:22,995
that is the x(HVL) layer here,

139
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:26,175
is equals to <i>0.7 / µ</i>.

140
00:08:27,236 --> 00:08:31,716
This didn't still say much to it,
but since µ is in one over centimetes,

141
00:08:31,716 --> 00:08:34,065
the unit of the half value layer
is in centimeters

142
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:37,244
and this much more intuitive

143
00:08:37,244 --> 00:08:43,594
to grasp the ability of a material
to absorb x-rays or of a tissue.

144
00:08:43,594 --> 00:08:47,225
What are typical half-value layers here?

145
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:51,168
Are they given typically for tissues
at several centimeters?

146
00:08:51,168 --> 00:08:53,489
It depends ont he x-ray that's being used.

147
00:08:53,489 --> 00:08:56,415
For aluminum, it's on the order 
of 1 to 2 centimeters,

148
00:08:56,465 --> 00:09:01,498
and 3 millimeters for lead,
or 0.3 centimeters here.

149
00:09:03,037 --> 00:09:05,368
So let's look at the question,

150
00:09:05,368 --> 00:09:08,367
"What are typical attenuation 
coefficients?"

151
00:09:08,367 --> 00:09:12,005
So we'll look at the linear attenuation
coefficient for different materials;

152
00:09:12,005 --> 00:09:13,647
hydrogen, water vapor,

153
00:09:13,647 --> 00:09:16,737
we have air, fat, ice water,
and compact bone.

154
00:09:17,099 --> 00:09:20,759
Here's the density of the tissue given
in <i>g / cm</i>.

155
00:09:20,881 --> 00:09:23,620
Here's the density of the electrons given,

156
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,385
the electrons per mass,

157
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,941
and then we have the electron density
per volume--is given here,

158
00:09:28,941 --> 00:09:31,971
and this is the linear attenuation
coefficient.

159
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:36,671
And we can see a close correspondence
between the linear attenuation coefficient

160
00:09:36,671 --> 00:09:42,611
and the density of the electrons
in the tissue.

161
00:09:42,611 --> 00:09:44,002
I think that's remarkable.

162
00:09:44,002 --> 00:09:50,629
If we look at the density of water
and the linear attenuation coefficient,

163
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:52,553
we divide the linear 
attenuation coefficent

164
00:09:52,617 --> 00:09:56,617
by the density of water,
be it ice or in liquid form,

165
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:58,787
then we find that this is the same.

166
00:09:58,787 --> 00:10:01,205
There's a 10% difference 
in the linear attenuation coefficent

167
00:10:01,205 --> 00:10:03,054
in water and ice,

168
00:10:03,054 --> 00:10:07,967
and there is a 10% difference in density
between ice and water.

169
00:10:08,767 --> 00:10:11,235
This means that for water,

170
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,718
whether it's in liquid or in solid form,

171
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:19,618
once we normal per mass, 
then we get the same constant,

172
00:10:19,678 --> 00:10:25,058
so we get a universal constant
for that particular compound.

173
00:10:25,058 --> 00:10:31,248
And therefore it is useful to define
the mass attenuation coefficient

174
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:33,679
which is <i>µ / ρ</i>,

175
00:10:33,679 --> 00:10:37,368
it has the unit of <i>cm²/g</i>,

176
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:41,048
and this would then give us a value

177
00:10:41,048 --> 00:10:44,229
that is constant for all forms 
of the kind of substance,

178
00:10:44,229 --> 00:10:46,386
in this case, for example water.

179
00:10:46,514 --> 00:10:48,844
So the mass attenuation coefficient
is defined as

180
00:10:48,844 --> 00:10:54,096
the linear attenuation coefficient 
divided by the density of the compound.

181
00:10:55,094 --> 00:10:57,906
And this also an explanation

182
00:10:57,906 --> 00:10:59,924
why we need more sunscreen 
in the mountains.

183
00:10:59,924 --> 00:11:02,775
If we go up in the mountains,
the air is thinner.

184
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,886
Because it is thinner,

185
00:11:04,886 --> 00:11:07,145
it has a lower linear
attenuation coefficient,

186
00:11:07,145 --> 00:11:08,505
it is still the same air.

187
00:11:08,505 --> 00:11:11,226
So the mass attenuation coefficient
would be the same,

188
00:11:11,226 --> 00:11:13,556
or given that the density is lower,

189
00:11:13,556 --> 00:11:19,035
up in the mountains we have more--

190
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:21,777
less attenuation by the air.

191
00:11:21,777 --> 00:11:23,148
Of course, we're also higher up

192
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:27,407
so the ultraviolet from the sun 
that arrives

193
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:30,367
still has some distance to travel.
