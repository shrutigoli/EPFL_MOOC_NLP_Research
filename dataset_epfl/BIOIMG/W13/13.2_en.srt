1
00:00:04,264 --> 00:00:05,845
We have seen that our magnetization

2
00:00:05,845 --> 00:00:09,072
is the result of the sum
of the individual dipole moments

3
00:00:09,072 --> 00:00:12,350
of all the molecules
that are present in our voxel.

4
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:16,593
Now the molecules, in general,
and certainly our body temperatures,

5
00:00:17,763 --> 00:00:20,753
the molecules are moving around,
they are diffusing around.

6
00:00:20,753 --> 00:00:22,015
So we have diffusion,

7
00:00:22,015 --> 00:00:27,345
we have motion of the molecules
during the MR experiment.

8
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:31,793
And I want to first discuss
the nature of this motion,

9
00:00:31,793 --> 00:00:35,096
and then we will go into the description

10
00:00:35,096 --> 00:00:38,356
on how this affects the MR signal.

11
00:00:38,356 --> 00:00:40,708
So here we have a random path,
we have a molecule,

12
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:43,318
and this will undergo some random path.

13
00:00:43,318 --> 00:00:45,785
Or in more general terms,
we start at a time zero,

14
00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:47,149
the molecule is here,

15
00:00:47,149 --> 00:00:50,639
and after time Δ it will be 
at a certain distance

16
00:00:50,639 --> 00:00:52,969
displaced from its original origin.

17
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:58,507
This is the effect of self-diffusion.

18
00:00:59,767 --> 00:01:06,171
So if we look at here an example,
we have at time Δ, which is 100 ms,

19
00:01:06,171 --> 00:01:10,140
and in this case, this gives us
a mean displacement

20
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,850
of the molecules of roughly 20 microns.

21
00:01:14,410 --> 00:01:15,900
If one waits for a longer time,

22
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,661
of course, the molecules 
will diffuse further away,

23
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:24,442
and here we have, then, a distance 
of 45 microns if we wait half a second.

24
00:01:25,882 --> 00:01:28,558
So the molecules 
will diffuse further away,

25
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:31,578
on average than with longer time.

26
00:01:31,578 --> 00:01:35,824
And here, if we take an example of 1 s,
then the mean displacement

27
00:01:35,824 --> 00:01:42,684
is 63 microns, and this gives 
a larger extent of the motion.

28
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:48,646
This random motion diffusion
was described by Einstein.

29
00:01:48,646 --> 00:01:53,254
It's the Einstein random walk,
and this mean displacement

30
00:01:53,254 --> 00:01:55,636
is given by the square root

31
00:01:55,636 --> 00:02:01,356
of 6 times a constant <i>D</i>
times the time <i>big Δ.</i>

32
00:02:01,686 --> 00:02:04,447
<i>D</i> is called here 
the <i>self-diffusion coefficient,</i>

33
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:10,536
and <i>r</i> is the root means square
displacement after <i>Δ</i> s.

34
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:16,697
So the self-diffusion coefficient
depends on a number of parameters,

35
00:02:16,697 --> 00:02:21,688
it depends also on 
the size of the molecule,

36
00:02:21,688 --> 00:02:23,150
how easily does it diffuse,

37
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:26,969
smaller molecules move more
than bigger molecules,

38
00:02:26,969 --> 00:02:31,761
and we're going to illustrate this
in the following experiment

39
00:02:31,761 --> 00:02:36,891
with two different types of fluids
to illustrate the effect.

40
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:40,151
So what I'm going to do 
is I'm going to take

41
00:02:40,151 --> 00:02:42,351
some colored alcohol here,

42
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:49,511
pour it in, and we can see how 
it starts to distribute the color.

43
00:02:49,882 --> 00:02:52,662
And here we have a colored water solution.

44
00:02:52,662 --> 00:02:54,051
I'll pour it in.

45
00:02:55,157 --> 00:02:57,867
And now we can see the clear difference.

46
00:02:57,867 --> 00:03:01,872
On the alcohol side, it's already
distributed, so fast diffusion.

47
00:03:01,872 --> 00:03:03,542
The color has already distributed,

48
00:03:03,542 --> 00:03:05,792
whereas with the water we can see

49
00:03:05,792 --> 00:03:08,023
this is going to take quite some time

50
00:03:08,023 --> 00:03:11,433
until the color is evenly distributed.

51
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:15,709
We can see that now 
several minutes have lapsed,

52
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:18,059
and we can see that on the alcohol side

53
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:20,745
it's uniformly blue,
so it's very well diffused,

54
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:23,705
whereas for the water 
colored solution that we put in,

55
00:03:23,705 --> 00:03:26,609
it still hasn't mixed
with the uncolored water,

56
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:28,991
so it's very slow diffusion on this side.

57
00:03:28,991 --> 00:03:33,742
This illustrates the effect 
of molecule size on the diffusability

58
00:03:33,742 --> 00:03:36,106
of the molecule.

59
00:03:38,032 --> 00:03:40,826
Okay, so we've seen that molecules move,

60
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:43,934
we've it in the experiment
with the colored dyes.

61
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:47,802
They move, this motion 
can depend on molecule size.

62
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:50,907
But now the question 
is how does this affect

63
00:03:50,907 --> 00:03:53,068
the magnetization,
in particular the phase?

64
00:03:53,068 --> 00:03:56,430
We've seen that bulk motion
affects the phase in a coherent manner,

65
00:03:56,430 --> 00:04:00,393
which allows us to determine
the velocity of a molecule.

66
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:03,284
And we'll go here and we'll
stick with the same principle,

67
00:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,428
we're going to look at 
the magnetization phase

68
00:04:05,428 --> 00:04:07,048
in complex plane.

69
00:04:07,048 --> 00:04:08,891
And we're looking here now 
at an experiment,

70
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:10,336
we'll do a 90-degree pulse,

71
00:04:10,336 --> 00:04:13,389
we'll just, for simplicity, 
assume it's a 90-degree pulse,

72
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:16,370
and now we'll turn on
the gradient in any direction,

73
00:04:16,370 --> 00:04:18,760
x, y, or z, you can call it 
whatever you want,

74
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,503
it doesn't really matter.

75
00:04:20,503 --> 00:04:23,972
What is important here 
is it's the same strength in both cases,

76
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:26,737
one's positive, one's negative,
or negative and positive,

77
00:04:26,737 --> 00:04:28,492
and the duration is the same.

78
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:33,943
So the area is the same for 
the two gradient pulses that are applied.

79
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:37,911
As we have seen before, this is a--
in terms of magnetization phase

80
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:41,262
for molecules that don't move--
is a dumb experiment.

81
00:04:41,262 --> 00:04:45,425
The effect of the gradient is nil,
there will be no net phase accrued

82
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:49,608
after these two gradients
for a stationary molecule.

83
00:04:50,174 --> 00:04:52,665
So let's look at the stationary case,
graphically.

84
00:04:52,665 --> 00:04:54,974
We'll have the after the 90-degree pulse,

85
00:04:55,404 --> 00:05:00,385
we have the magnetization all in phase.

86
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:03,384
The 90-degree pulse flips them all,
and they are all colinear.

87
00:05:03,384 --> 00:05:07,496
And we have just plotted here 
three positions along the gradient.

88
00:05:08,316 --> 00:05:12,207
Now during the gradient period
indicated by the letter <i>b</i> here,

89
00:05:12,207 --> 00:05:14,036
so we turn on the gradient.

90
00:05:14,036 --> 00:05:16,667
What now happens 
is that the magnetizations

91
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:20,417
undergo a phase evolution
depending on their position,

92
00:05:20,417 --> 00:05:23,296
and that's indicated here
by the three positions.

93
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:26,348
Then comes the period <i>c,</i>
and this period <i>c,</i>

94
00:05:26,348 --> 00:05:28,999
we just wait a certain amount of time.

95
00:05:28,999 --> 00:05:32,008
So nothing happens, 
we still have the same phase,

96
00:05:32,888 --> 00:05:36,222
and we're neglecting relaxation here 
in the consideration.

97
00:05:36,222 --> 00:05:38,382
And now finally comes period <i>d,</i>

98
00:05:38,382 --> 00:05:40,967
we turn on the gradient
with opposite polarity.

99
00:05:41,677 --> 00:05:42,858
So we turn it on,

100
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:46,211
and now what happens is since 
the gradient has opposite polarity,

101
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:48,580
the three magnetization positions--

102
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,491
the magnetization at the three positions--

103
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:52,777
will turn with a same precession velocity,

104
00:05:52,777 --> 00:05:55,631
the Larmor frequency 
but in the opposite direction,

105
00:05:55,631 --> 00:05:58,099
and after the duration of this gradient--

106
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:01,801
so this area is equal to this area,
or the same amplitude,

107
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,401
the duration is the same--

108
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:07,014
they will all be aligned, again,
as in the original position.

109
00:06:07,014 --> 00:06:09,453
And this is what I said,
this is the dumb experiment,

110
00:06:09,453 --> 00:06:11,578
there's nothing interesting going on here.

111
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:16,252
We have echo formation, of course,
which is a nice feature.

112
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:20,665
Now let's look at what happens
if we allow the magnetization

113
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:22,813
to undergo motion.

114
00:06:23,563 --> 00:06:28,664
So we start out with 
the magnetization stationary,

115
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:31,049
here.

116
00:06:31,558 --> 00:06:34,355
We turn on the gradient pulse,
so we have the encoding,

117
00:06:34,355 --> 00:06:35,594
so we have the different phase.

118
00:06:35,594 --> 00:06:37,884
In this case, the experiments 
are the same.

119
00:06:37,884 --> 00:06:40,276
And now during period <i>c,</i>

120
00:06:40,276 --> 00:06:43,937
we will assume that there is 
motion of the molecules.

121
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:46,076
So, as you can see, 
the colors have changed.

122
00:06:46,076 --> 00:06:49,644
So the blue molecule is now 
where the orange was,

123
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:51,726
and the orange is where the blue was.

124
00:06:52,296 --> 00:06:55,256
So we are assuming here,
that the molecules are being displaced,

125
00:06:55,256 --> 00:06:58,734
and in this case, a very simple situation
to illustrate the principle,

126
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:03,568
we've just interchanged the position
of two of our magnetizations here.

127
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:06,749
So these are the two 
that we have interchanged.

128
00:07:06,749 --> 00:07:11,008
Now what happens when 
we turn on the positive gradient,

129
00:07:11,008 --> 00:07:12,759
we change the polarity.

130
00:07:12,759 --> 00:07:15,779
Now the blue one will rephase
with the precession velocity

131
00:07:15,779 --> 00:07:19,930
corresponding to this position,
but it has not had initial phase

132
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,747
that corresponds to this phase,
so it will actually overturn here,

133
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:25,648
whereas the orange one,
which had a bigger phase

134
00:07:25,648 --> 00:07:27,410
to start with from this position,

135
00:07:27,410 --> 00:07:31,753
now will only go back 
according to the blue position here

136
00:07:31,753 --> 00:07:33,852
so it will not completely turn back.

137
00:07:34,432 --> 00:07:38,373
Now, can you guess what the effect
is on the net magnetization?

138
00:07:39,683 --> 00:07:41,543
Consider here, there's no motion,

139
00:07:41,543 --> 00:07:44,008
we have nice echo, we have 
maximum amplitude.

140
00:07:44,008 --> 00:07:47,154
Here we have the magnetization vectors
are no longer colinear.

141
00:07:47,154 --> 00:07:49,766
And since what we are observing
the total magnetization

142
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:52,594
is the sum of all 
magnetizations in our voxel,

143
00:07:52,594 --> 00:07:55,333
the voxel magnetization is reduced.

144
00:07:56,003 --> 00:07:58,393
So as a consequence, 
the effect of diffusion,

145
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:00,844
which happens here during time period <i>c,</i>

146
00:08:00,844 --> 00:08:04,835
is to reduce the signal amplitude.

147
00:08:05,664 --> 00:08:07,824
We have assumed here 
in this whole procedure,

148
00:08:07,824 --> 00:08:09,845
that the time <i>c</i> is long 
compared to the gradient.

149
00:08:09,845 --> 00:08:13,656
This is not likely strong here,
we'll assume this is very short,

150
00:08:13,656 --> 00:08:15,766
this is very short, 
and this is relatively long,

151
00:08:15,766 --> 00:08:20,216
so we'll only consider motion 
during the time period <i>c.</i>

152
00:08:22,185 --> 00:08:25,046
So now I want to do this 
with magnetization vectors.

153
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:27,551
The animation will 
start here in condition <i>a,</i>

154
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:30,668
so we have all the magnetization 
vectors lined up,

155
00:08:31,438 --> 00:08:32,778
they are colinear,

156
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:36,137
and the net transverse 
magnetization is maximally.

157
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:38,398
As we go through the gradient,

158
00:08:39,617 --> 00:08:42,279
we have dephasing, 
according to their positions.

159
00:08:44,627 --> 00:08:46,998
Then we will look at displaced spins,

160
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:50,581
so we have them colinear
at the beginning,

161
00:08:52,513 --> 00:08:55,339
we have also dephasing,
so this is the same.

162
00:08:55,339 --> 00:08:57,909
Now we'll assume 
that for the displaced spins,

163
00:08:57,909 --> 00:09:02,030
for these guys, that they will 
change position among each other,

164
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:05,321
so similar to the case here,
so they will be returning back

165
00:09:05,321 --> 00:09:08,092
but now with different 
precessional velocities.

166
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:10,991
Here, we'll consider 
the static magnetization,

167
00:09:10,991 --> 00:09:13,330
they are not exchanging position.

168
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:17,132
So when we do now, and this
has happened now for these spins here,

169
00:09:17,132 --> 00:09:18,242
here nothing has happened,

170
00:09:18,242 --> 00:09:20,280
here they have changed position.

171
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:22,912
And now we'll turn on 
the positive gradient.

172
00:09:23,463 --> 00:09:24,721
For the static magnetization

173
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:28,100
we come back to the maximum
magnetization possible,

174
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,313
but for those who have 
undergone diffusion,

175
00:09:30,313 --> 00:09:32,669
they no longer end up colinear,

176
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:36,483
and now if we do the vector addition
of these vector sums here

177
00:09:36,483 --> 00:09:39,104
of these magnetizations,
we end up with a net magnetization

178
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:41,136
that's not equal to four times here,

179
00:09:41,136 --> 00:09:45,775
and so the transverse 
magnetization is reduced.

180
00:09:46,654 --> 00:09:52,300
So this is the consequence
of random motion on the MR signal,

181
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:55,788
there is an amplitude reduction,
this is fair to say.

182
00:09:57,495 --> 00:10:00,006
So let's look at this magnetization--

183
00:10:00,546 --> 00:10:02,295
the effect of diffusion on magnetization,

184
00:10:02,295 --> 00:10:04,226
I'll take another view on this.

185
00:10:04,226 --> 00:10:07,125
We have time here,
we turn on the gradient,

186
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,318
one's positive, one's negative.

187
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:12,257
And we'll consider now, for a time <i>T,</i>

188
00:10:12,257 --> 00:10:16,095
both with the same amplitude
but positive and negative,

189
00:10:16,495 --> 00:10:20,644
and we'll look at the effect 
on signal amplitude.

190
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:24,207
So we have reduction of signal amplitude,

191
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:27,666
and then when the second 
gradient is turned on--

192
00:10:27,666 --> 00:10:30,171
now it's the letter <i>T</i>
is turning on the red--

193
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,632
then we have an echo formation.

194
00:10:33,632 --> 00:10:36,840
We have, again, dephasing 
during the first time period,

195
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:39,665
then when we turn on 
the second gradient,

196
00:10:39,665 --> 00:10:43,499
we have rephasing that is 
in the absence of incoherent motion,

197
00:10:43,499 --> 00:10:45,900
that is for static magnetization.

198
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,840
So how do we display this 
in terms of phase?

199
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:53,581
So we'll plot the phase here, 
for six isochromats.

200
00:10:53,581 --> 00:10:57,841
The phase is being built up
according to the six different positions

201
00:10:58,143 --> 00:10:59,811
during the first gradient time.

202
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,511
So this is here.

203
00:11:01,746 --> 00:11:04,983
Then it stays constant during 
the time here between the gradients.

204
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:07,050
And when we turn on the negative gradient,

205
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:12,414
the slope is equal but opposite,
so they all come back to the same phase.

206
00:11:12,652 --> 00:11:14,663
And so here that means

207
00:11:14,663 --> 00:11:16,993
if the phase is the same
for all magnetization vectors,

208
00:11:16,993 --> 00:11:20,873
we have maximum amplitude,
and echo formation,

209
00:11:20,873 --> 00:11:22,831
maximum echo amplitude.

210
00:11:24,173 --> 00:11:26,711
So now let's look at the effect
of incoherent motion,

211
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:32,053
and here I'll plot a matrix of 5x5 voxels.

212
00:11:32,803 --> 00:11:35,605
We apply a gradient 
in the horizontal direction,

213
00:11:35,605 --> 00:11:37,527
so now, according to that position,

214
00:11:37,527 --> 00:11:40,670
they are undergoing a differential phase.

215
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,556
This is during the first gradient.

216
00:11:42,996 --> 00:11:47,350
And now what we have 
during the period between the gradients,

217
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:50,148
and here we'll assume these gradients
are very small in duration,

218
00:11:50,148 --> 00:11:52,119
this period is very long by comparison,

219
00:11:52,119 --> 00:11:54,588
and again, this is relatively short.

220
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:59,130
So now we have no gradient
during the time between the gradients,

221
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:03,588
but we will assume during this time,

222
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:05,621
that some molecules undergo diffusion.

223
00:12:05,621 --> 00:12:08,417
Of course, we cannot draw 10^23 molecules

224
00:12:08,417 --> 00:12:11,757
so I've just taken three pairs here
that during this process

225
00:12:11,757 --> 00:12:14,362
we'll have assumed
that they have exchanged positions

226
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:16,461
to illustrate the case.

227
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,976
This is all in the direction 
of the gradient,

228
00:12:18,976 --> 00:12:21,062
which is in the horizontal direction.

229
00:12:21,062 --> 00:12:22,941
It doesn't matter 
what you call this direction,

230
00:12:22,941 --> 00:12:26,331
x, y, or z, whichever, it's just 
the direction of the gradient.

231
00:12:26,677 --> 00:12:30,567
So now these three pairs
have exchanged positions,

232
00:12:30,947 --> 00:12:33,942
and when we now turn on 
the negative gradient,

233
00:12:34,412 --> 00:12:36,153
what is the effect that we see?

234
00:12:36,393 --> 00:12:39,269
According to the position 
that they have now,

235
00:12:39,269 --> 00:12:42,322
the phase is turned back to 
its original position.

236
00:12:42,322 --> 00:12:45,704
So for the static magnetizations,
we can see here they're all colinear,

237
00:12:45,704 --> 00:12:48,515
these guys here, these guys, 
these guys, et cetera.

238
00:12:48,515 --> 00:12:52,443
They're all colinear, so that is for them
is maximum signal amplitude.

239
00:12:52,443 --> 00:12:55,783
But for these magnetizations,
which have undergone diffusion

240
00:12:55,783 --> 00:12:57,144
in this animation,

241
00:12:57,144 --> 00:13:01,132
their magnetization vectors
no longer are colinear,

242
00:13:01,132 --> 00:13:06,464
and therefore, if you now sum 
all the 25 magnetization vectors here,

243
00:13:06,464 --> 00:13:10,605
the net magnetization, 
the amplitude has been reduced.

244
00:13:11,467 --> 00:13:14,825
So if I draw now this phase 
as a function of time with diffusion,

245
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:17,520
so we'll look at the phase,
it's a build up,

246
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,125
and then when we go down 
with a negative gradient,

247
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:24,113
the slope is no longer the same
for all these six isochromats

248
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:26,498
because they have exchanged positions.

249
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:29,368
So we end up at the end 
of the second gradient,

250
00:13:29,368 --> 00:13:33,234
with a magnetization and phase dispersion

251
00:13:33,234 --> 00:13:37,166
that is no longer the same,
and therefore we have at this point--

252
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:38,889
because they're not all in phase--

253
00:13:38,889 --> 00:13:41,617
we have a reduced echo amplitude.

254
00:13:42,097 --> 00:13:44,691
So this is the graphical 
intuitive explanation

255
00:13:44,691 --> 00:13:46,700
of what happens during diffusion.

256
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:51,333
So, now how do we describe
the effect of diffusion on the MR signal

257
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:54,369
in a more quantitative way?

258
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:57,261
We'll do this here, and we will have

259
00:13:57,261 --> 00:14:00,510
a consideration on

260
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:05,070
what it is that reduces the signal.

261
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,918
Now we have to think about here,

262
00:14:06,918 --> 00:14:10,018
the reduction of the signal is a fact
that the molecules are displaced

263
00:14:10,018 --> 00:14:13,071
by a certain distance during a time
between the two gradients.

264
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:17,119
This distance of displacement

265
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:23,668
is the sole mechanism by which
the amplitude is reduced

266
00:14:23,668 --> 00:14:25,603
because when we're 
refocused with a gradient,

267
00:14:25,603 --> 00:14:26,881
they are at different position

268
00:14:26,881 --> 00:14:30,512
and the difference in phase 
compared to the initial phase

269
00:14:30,512 --> 00:14:32,101
is what reduces the signal.

270
00:14:32,101 --> 00:14:35,425
So what are the factors 
that reduce the signal amplitude?

271
00:14:35,953 --> 00:14:39,098
One is, of course, the strength
of the diffusion process.

272
00:14:39,858 --> 00:14:41,486
If the diffusion process is very strong,

273
00:14:41,486 --> 00:14:43,799
that is the molecules diffuse easily,

274
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:48,344
then we have a large displacement,

275
00:14:48,344 --> 00:14:52,035
so it's the diffusion process,
and this is the diffusion constant.

276
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:57,189
Now if we look at an experiment
with a positive gradient here,

277
00:14:58,006 --> 00:15:00,967
of amplitude <i>G,</i> and a negative gradient
of same amplitude <i>G,</i>

278
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:03,159
the duration of the gradient is <i>small 𝛿,</i>

279
00:15:03,159 --> 00:15:06,397
and they are separated by this time <i>big ∆.</i>

280
00:15:07,889 --> 00:15:12,910
Then what is the next factor 
that influences the distance

281
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,811
at the beginning and at the end 
of the experiment, the mean distance,

282
00:15:16,811 --> 00:15:20,041
that's the time between 
the dephasing and rephasing gradient,

283
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,591
that's the time <i>big ∆.</i>

284
00:15:23,428 --> 00:15:27,489
And finally, the phase is also dependent
on the strength of the gradient.

285
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,142
It's precisely not just the strength

286
00:15:30,142 --> 00:15:32,486
but it's the integral of the gradient.

287
00:15:32,486 --> 00:15:35,360
So if we have a strong gradient
for a long time period,

288
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,392
the magnetization vectors spread out

289
00:15:38,742 --> 00:15:39,750
much more.

290
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,994
And then we apply the same gradient,
so for the same position

291
00:15:43,414 --> 00:15:46,665
the phase difference between 
original position and the end position

292
00:15:46,665 --> 00:15:47,923
is going to be bigger,

293
00:15:47,923 --> 00:15:50,463
and therefore the signal 
is stronger attenuated.

294
00:15:50,893 --> 00:15:54,193
So it's the area of the dephasing gradient

295
00:15:54,193 --> 00:15:58,104
that influences, as well,
the signal reduction.

296
00:15:59,923 --> 00:16:01,057
Now I'm going to--

297
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:03,193
this is the example of a gradient echo

298
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:05,995
that's sensitizing the diffusion process--

299
00:16:05,995 --> 00:16:09,314
now I'm going to give you
the mathematical formulation of this

300
00:16:09,314 --> 00:16:10,875
but not the derivation of this.

301
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:16,396
We're just going to concern ourselves
with the result of this process.

302
00:16:16,396 --> 00:16:18,366
So the attenuation of the signal,

303
00:16:19,476 --> 00:16:21,707
due to diffusion 
in the direction of the gradient--

304
00:16:21,707 --> 00:16:23,557
of course, if there's 
diffusion perpendicular,

305
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:25,366
we won't be able to measure that,

306
00:16:25,366 --> 00:16:27,807
there's no influence on the signal phase--

307
00:16:27,807 --> 00:16:32,316
is actually described by a signal
in the absence of diffusion, <i>S0--</i>

308
00:16:32,316 --> 00:16:36,608
that's this term here--
times <i>e^(-bD).</i>

309
00:16:37,161 --> 00:16:38,910
That's a simple equation,

310
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:44,489
[an empirical] equation,
it works very well for a free liquid

311
00:16:44,489 --> 00:16:49,440
that is like the color dyes
that we have seen.

312
00:16:50,548 --> 00:16:52,537
<i>D</i> is the diffusion process,

313
00:16:52,537 --> 00:16:54,548
<i>b</i> is an experimental parameter,

314
00:16:54,828 --> 00:16:58,711
and <i>b</i> is the so-called
<i>b factor</i> or <i>b value,</i>

315
00:16:58,711 --> 00:17:00,809
and here is the exact value given.

316
00:17:00,809 --> 00:17:04,311
So it's first the accrued phase,

317
00:17:04,311 --> 00:17:08,701
so it's gradient times duration 
times <i>γ,</i> squared,

318
00:17:09,408 --> 00:17:12,873
times <i>big Δ</i> minus <i>small 𝛿</i> over 3.

319
00:17:12,873 --> 00:17:14,733
So if the <i>small 𝛿</i> is small,

320
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,343
the duration of the gradient is small
compared to this time,

321
00:17:17,343 --> 00:17:19,358
then this is essentially the duration,

322
00:17:19,358 --> 00:17:20,872
this is the gradient area,

323
00:17:20,872 --> 00:17:23,061
that's this area here, squared.

324
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:26,385
That's the <i>b</i> factor and, like I said,
I don't want to go through

325
00:17:26,385 --> 00:17:29,862
the mathemetical derivation 
of this expression here,

326
00:17:29,862 --> 00:17:35,824
we'll just satisfy us 
with the equation here.

327
00:17:36,303 --> 00:17:39,365
So <i>b</i> is the parameter 
that the operator can choose.

328
00:17:39,365 --> 00:17:43,868
We can choose the <i>big Δ, </i>
we can choose the <i>small 𝛿,</i>

329
00:17:43,868 --> 00:17:45,945
and we can choose the gradient strength.

330
00:17:45,945 --> 00:17:50,367
That's the experimental parameter
that we can choose,

331
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:54,566
and <i>D</i> describes the diffusion process.

332
00:17:54,956 --> 00:17:57,295
Now in this case, it's not 
the self-diffusion coefficient

333
00:17:57,295 --> 00:17:59,083
in magnetic resonance,

334
00:17:59,083 --> 00:18:02,670
it is called the <i>apparent diffusion
coefficient</i> or <i>ADC</i>

335
00:18:02,670 --> 00:18:05,249
because it's an apparent diffusion
that one measures

336
00:18:05,249 --> 00:18:10,379
and it is not necessarily the true
diffusion of the molecule.

337
00:18:11,207 --> 00:18:14,830
Although, in the case of free water,
for example, we can very well

338
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:18,388
quantitatively measure this ADC,

339
00:18:18,388 --> 00:18:20,489
and from the ADC measurement--

340
00:18:21,289 --> 00:18:23,369
because this changes with temperature--

341
00:18:23,369 --> 00:18:26,210
we can actually determine,
to a very good precision,

342
00:18:26,210 --> 00:18:28,585
the temperature of the water sample.

343
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,901
Now the sequence 
that I've shown you here--

344
00:18:31,901 --> 00:18:35,740
that's diffusion weighting, it introduces 
this weighting into the signal--

345
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:38,559
can also be done with a spin echo.

346
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:42,521
So we have the two gradients,
now they are positive

347
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:46,189
because between them 
we've inserted a 180-degree pulse.

348
00:18:46,891 --> 00:18:49,492
So, as you remember, 
for static magnetization,

349
00:18:49,492 --> 00:18:52,363
positive gradients, the effect 
of 180-degree pulse

350
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:55,210
is to refocus the static 
magnetization here.

351
00:18:55,210 --> 00:19:00,022
So that would be the equivalent 
sequence with a spin echo,

352
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:02,026
above we have the gradient echo,

353
00:19:02,026 --> 00:19:05,828
and the spin echo has the advantage,
it is only dependent on T2,

354
00:19:05,828 --> 00:19:08,495
and T2 is always longer than T2*,

355
00:19:08,495 --> 00:19:13,713
so one can use longer diffusion times,
<i>big Δ,</i> with this approach.
