1
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:07,944
We've seen in Lecture 11 that MRI,
magnetic resonance imaging,

2
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:11,946
is a technique
that's very sensitive to motion.

3
00:00:11,946 --> 00:00:14,686
There we introduced it as a problem

4
00:00:14,686 --> 00:00:18,296
in the sense that it creates
corrupted data sets.

5
00:00:18,296 --> 00:00:20,808
Now, usually when there is a problem
with magnetic resonance

6
00:00:20,808 --> 00:00:23,008
then there is usually also an application,

7
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:25,628
and this is what I want
to talk about first--

8
00:00:25,628 --> 00:00:29,479
that is, the effect of motion
on the signal,

9
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:32,749
and, in particular, here
on the rephased signal.

10
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:35,479
And we're first going to talk
about bulk motion,

11
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:39,681
and later we're going to talk
about random motion today.

12
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:42,131
So, what is bulk motion?

13
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:44,581
What are we concerned here with,
or what are we interested in?

14
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:47,482
Here is an example
of an angiogram, it's blood flow.

15
00:00:47,482 --> 00:00:51,783
We have the blood vessels depicted here--
this is an MR angiogram--

16
00:00:51,783 --> 00:00:54,143
obtained completely non-invasively,

17
00:00:56,363 --> 00:01:00,415
a depiction of the blood vessels
here in the brain.

18
00:01:00,415 --> 00:01:04,045
What is bright are the blood vessels
and the stationary magnetization,

19
00:01:04,045 --> 00:01:07,355
that doesn't move,
has been suppressed from this image.

20
00:01:08,185 --> 00:01:10,727
So let's look at the phase
of the magnetization

21
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:15,007
to understand how this can be registered.

22
00:01:15,007 --> 00:01:17,267
The phase of the transverse magnetization,

23
00:01:17,267 --> 00:01:18,743
as a function of time, M_⊥(t),

24
00:01:18,743 --> 00:01:24,738
is given by the transverse magnetization
at time zero, M_⊥(t), times <i>e ^ (i Φ (t))</i>.

25
00:01:24,738 --> 00:01:27,449
This is in a complex plane, so we denote,

26
00:01:27,449 --> 00:01:31,529
as usual, the real part, for example,
is the <i>x</i> component of the magnetization,

27
00:01:31,529 --> 00:01:34,913
and the imaginary part
of this complex number

28
00:01:34,913 --> 00:01:38,500
is the <i>y</i> component of the magnetization.

29
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:42,331
Now, here we have written <i>Φ (t)</i>,
so it's a time-dependent phase,

30
00:01:42,331 --> 00:01:44,922
and the question is,
what is this phase?

31
00:01:44,922 --> 00:01:47,272
This phase, in very general terms,
we have seen,

32
00:01:47,272 --> 00:01:50,023
is given by the integral of the gradient

33
00:01:50,023 --> 00:01:54,338
times the position with time--
there's a <i>γ</i> in there, of course,

34
00:01:54,338 --> 00:01:55,753
to get the phase--

35
00:01:55,753 --> 00:01:59,034
and this particular example,
this equation here is for the case

36
00:01:59,034 --> 00:02:00,896
of a gradient along <i>x</i>.

37
00:02:00,896 --> 00:02:03,545
Here <i>t'</i> denotes
the integration variable,

38
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:07,316
just to distinguish it from the time <i>t</i>,
which is this variable here--

39
00:02:07,316 --> 00:02:09,996
this is the integral from <i>0</i> to <i>t</i> here.

40
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:14,647
So this is the phase that we obtain,
that's the general expression.

41
00:02:14,647 --> 00:02:16,568
Now, I'm going to--
and you'll see shortly why--

42
00:02:16,568 --> 00:02:20,229
I'm going to now write the phase of <i>t</i>,
this integral,

43
00:02:20,229 --> 00:02:22,858
I'll split it in two integrals,
so there's two time periods--

44
00:02:22,858 --> 00:02:26,309
one from zero to big <i>T</i>,
where the gradient along <i>x</i>

45
00:02:26,309 --> 00:02:31,981
(we'll stick with <i>x</i> here)
is along <i>x</i> is <i>G_x</i>--

46
00:02:31,981 --> 00:02:34,811
and then we have a subsequent time period

47
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:37,591
from time <i>t</i> to <i>2t</i>, here,

48
00:02:37,591 --> 00:02:39,922
where the gradient is minus <i>G_x</i>.

49
00:02:39,922 --> 00:02:44,083
So we're basically depicting an experiment
where the gradient is first positive,

50
00:02:44,083 --> 00:02:48,023
and then, at time <i>t</i>,
switch to a negative value.

51
00:02:48,023 --> 00:02:50,003
And this is what we're looking at.

52
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:54,205
Now here this is just--
negative is first, and then positive,

53
00:02:54,205 --> 00:02:56,924
it doesn't make a difference
what the sign here is;

54
00:02:56,924 --> 00:02:59,065
the sign really is not important.

55
00:02:59,065 --> 00:03:01,156
So this is the gradient along <i>x</i>,

56
00:03:01,156 --> 00:03:04,166
what we see, the phase evolution
as a function of time

57
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:07,337
at <i>time 2 T</i> is given here

58
00:03:07,337 --> 00:03:09,527
by this expression here.

59
00:03:09,527 --> 00:03:12,447
So, small <i>t</i> here is equal to big <i>2 T</i>,

60
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,247
<i>2</i> times big <i>T</i>.

61
00:03:14,247 --> 00:03:18,549
Now, what we're going to express here
is the position of the magnetization

62
00:03:18,549 --> 00:03:19,939
that we have in the voxel.

63
00:03:19,939 --> 00:03:23,359
Normally we would describe it
as a stationary magnetization,

64
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:26,500
that's what we've dealt with so far
in Lecture 11.

65
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,102
Now, here we're going to assume
that this magnetization in our voxel

66
00:03:31,102 --> 00:03:34,282
is moving at a constant velocity <i>v</i>.

67
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:35,912
So the position as a function of time

68
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:39,522
is now no longer constant
but it's given by <i>x_0</i>--

69
00:03:39,522 --> 00:03:42,533
the original position--
plus <i>v</i> times <i>t</i>.

70
00:03:42,533 --> 00:03:47,743
And now we'll write the substitute <i>x</i> of <i>t</i>
in the above integral--

71
00:03:47,743 --> 00:03:51,144
so we'll substitute
this expression in here--

72
00:03:51,144 --> 00:03:53,205
and we'll obtain these two integrals.

73
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:56,435
We can now see that this integral here

74
00:03:56,435 --> 00:03:58,805
and this term here,

75
00:03:58,805 --> 00:04:00,625
they are the same,
they are constant in time,

76
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:05,366
their interval is <i>t</i>,
so these two terms will subtract out,

77
00:04:05,366 --> 00:04:08,627
the stationary magnetization due to
stationary magnetization,

78
00:04:08,627 --> 00:04:11,887
and that is the condition
of echo formation.

79
00:04:12,647 --> 00:04:16,919
So I'll just be concerned with the term
that is dependent on the velocity--

80
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:20,730
well, here we've kept actually the time,
the constant term, in here--

81
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:22,409
and we'll take this term here,

82
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,080
here's the integral.

83
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,940
So here's the constant term,
this is negative, this is positive,

84
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:31,092
same value from <i>0</i> to <i>T</i>
and from <i>T</i> to <i>2 T</i>

85
00:04:31,092 --> 00:04:33,092
so the difference in <i>t</i> here is <i>T</i>,

86
00:04:33,092 --> 00:04:35,023
so these two terms cancel.

87
00:04:35,023 --> 00:04:36,973
So we're just concerned
with this term here,

88
00:04:36,973 --> 00:04:39,833
and this term here,
and you can verify here very easily

89
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:43,383
that these terms now
no longer cancel out to zero.

90
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:45,074
And the consequence is--

91
00:04:45,074 --> 00:04:48,095
do the integration here,
I won't do it in all details--

92
00:04:48,095 --> 00:04:51,525
that we get a phase at time <i>2T</i>, big <i>T</i>,

93
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:54,843
which is given by <i>γ G</i>,
the gradient,

94
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:59,095
times the velocity,
times this time squared.

95
00:04:59,095 --> 00:05:02,957
So we have a phase now
of the magnetization

96
00:05:02,957 --> 00:05:06,448
that is changed depending on the velocity

97
00:05:06,448 --> 00:05:10,379
in the direction of the gradient,
and the gradient strength,

98
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:14,479
as well as the duration
of the gradient application.

99
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:16,839
So we'll look now, graphically,

100
00:05:16,839 --> 00:05:18,670
at the implication of this.

101
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:22,350
We'll first plot the phase
as a function of time.

102
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,991
We'll first consider a stationary voxel--

103
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,511
so no magnetization moving,
here's the phase on the vertical axis;

104
00:05:28,511 --> 00:05:31,473
on the horizontal axis we have time.

105
00:05:31,473 --> 00:05:36,343
And as we move through time
with the gradient,

106
00:05:36,343 --> 00:05:39,870
the phase goes first up,
with a constant slope--

107
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:41,743
that's the constant gradient--

108
00:05:41,743 --> 00:05:46,304
and it then comes down
after another time big <i>T</i>.

109
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,175
So we have the times here indicated:

110
00:05:48,175 --> 00:05:50,806
zero is the beginning
where the gradient is turned on,

111
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:53,266
the big <i>T</i> is the time
where the gradient polarity

112
00:05:53,266 --> 00:05:55,207
that is the sign
of the gradient's changed,

113
00:05:55,207 --> 00:05:58,597
and <i>2 T</i> is two times this time.

114
00:05:58,597 --> 00:06:01,947
So this is for stationary magnetization;
this is the case we've discussed

115
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:07,599
extensively in Lecture 11
and a little bit in Lecture 12.

116
00:06:09,409 --> 00:06:14,280
We have, of course, this condition
that the phase at the end is zero here--

117
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,840
the phase comes back
to the same value as it was here.

118
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,920
This is given by the fact that [inaudible]
for the stationary magnetization,

119
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:23,912
the integral of the gradient, here,
the total area, is zero;

120
00:06:23,912 --> 00:06:26,251
or this area is equal to this area,

121
00:06:26,251 --> 00:06:28,342
and this is echo formation.

122
00:06:28,342 --> 00:06:32,233
So this then defines the echo time, <i>T E</i>.

123
00:06:32,233 --> 00:06:36,525
Now, if we consider blood
moving with velocity <i>v</i>--

124
00:06:36,525 --> 00:06:40,555
so here's the blood,
we have our magnetization in the voxel,

125
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:43,645
and that is now moving
with velocity to the right.

126
00:06:43,645 --> 00:06:45,194
As this happens,

127
00:06:46,234 --> 00:06:47,576
as it moves,

128
00:06:47,576 --> 00:06:52,157
we are accruing a phase,
and then we're losing the phase again,

129
00:06:52,157 --> 00:06:54,737
but at the end we have
a difference in phase

130
00:06:54,737 --> 00:06:57,618
compared to stationary magnetization.

131
00:06:57,618 --> 00:07:00,769
And this difference in phase here,
<i>Φ (T E)</i>,

132
00:07:00,769 --> 00:07:04,998
this phase is dependent on the velocity,

133
00:07:04,998 --> 00:07:08,360
so it is a measure of the velocity
of the moving blood

134
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,799
in the direction of the gradient.

135
00:07:11,799 --> 00:07:15,591
So in the integration it comes from
these two terms here,

136
00:07:15,591 --> 00:07:17,913
that don't cancel out;

137
00:07:17,913 --> 00:07:20,842
in this integral
this stationary magnetization,

138
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:23,484
the phase cancels out.

139
00:07:24,144 --> 00:07:26,155
So if we look 
at the transverse magnetization

140
00:07:26,155 --> 00:07:28,084
at a point <i>(x, y)</i>,

141
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:29,574
then the magnetization at this point

142
00:07:29,574 --> 00:07:31,605
is proportional to <i>e</i> to the <i>i</i>

143
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:37,097
times the integral of the <i>γ G</i>
times the position--

144
00:07:37,097 --> 00:07:38,466
here it's gradient along <i>x</i>,

145
00:07:38,466 --> 00:07:41,957
so that's this expression here,
that we are using here--

146
00:07:41,957 --> 00:07:44,778
and this is equal to the k-space;

147
00:07:44,778 --> 00:07:47,659
that's the normal image formulation

148
00:07:47,659 --> 00:07:50,558
that we've had
for stationary magnetization.

149
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,859
Now, the phase
that is induced by the motion

150
00:07:53,859 --> 00:07:55,479
does not depend on the position.

151
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:57,420
So that means, basically,

152
00:07:57,420 --> 00:08:01,730
for a given velocity,
in the direction of the gradient,

153
00:08:01,730 --> 00:08:08,291
the phase in the voxel will change
by the same amount of radians, or degrees,

154
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,911
independent of its position.

155
00:08:10,911 --> 00:08:17,123
So this is position-independent,
so it's a direct encoding of the velocity,

156
00:08:17,123 --> 00:08:19,503
and that means that the entire echo,

157
00:08:19,503 --> 00:08:22,053
if all the magnetization's
moving at this velocity,

158
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:23,665
in the direction of the gradient,

159
00:08:23,665 --> 00:08:26,936
has a phase <i>Φ (T E)</i>.

160
00:08:27,646 --> 00:08:31,106
So we can now write the magnetization

161
00:08:31,106 --> 00:08:35,376
at a position in voxels,
is proportional to <i>e ^ (i Φ)</i>--

162
00:08:35,376 --> 00:08:38,286
and <i>Φ</i> here is given
by the expression on the left--

163
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:41,407
in this expression I've substituted
<i>2 T</i> with <i>T E</i>,

164
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:43,918
so now we have the term here.

165
00:08:44,838 --> 00:08:47,988
So, for obtaining images like this,

166
00:08:47,988 --> 00:08:54,390
this is one way to obtain
encoding of velocity in the voxel.

167
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:58,391
For such an image one can obtain
the encoding of the velocity--

168
00:08:58,391 --> 00:09:01,822
not just the velocity but also
the direction; it's along the gradient--

169
00:09:01,822 --> 00:09:07,782
by simply recording the change in phase
compared to stationary magnetization

170
00:09:07,782 --> 00:09:10,803
with appropriate reference scans.

171
00:09:10,803 --> 00:09:13,564
So we see that motion affects the phase

172
00:09:13,564 --> 00:09:16,403
of the voxel.

173
00:09:16,403 --> 00:09:17,964
So this is now coherent motion,

174
00:09:17,964 --> 00:09:19,824
we've assumed that the entire voxel,

175
00:09:19,824 --> 00:09:21,694
the magnetization in the entire voxel,

176
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,854
moves in a certain direction.

177
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:26,738
Now what we are going to be concerned with

178
00:09:26,738 --> 00:09:29,106
is random motion.

179
00:09:29,106 --> 00:09:31,926
This will be the next section.
