1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:05,441
In this section

2
00:00:05,441 --> 00:00:09,891
I'd like to do a comparison
of the bio-imaging modalities

3
00:00:09,891 --> 00:00:12,101
that we have treated in this course,

4
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:15,072
both Part 1 and Part 2,
put them in juxtaposition,

5
00:00:15,072 --> 00:00:22,303
so we have an easy overview
of which imaging modality can do what.

6
00:00:22,763 --> 00:00:25,102
Now, there's a question
that one always has:

7
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:28,263
what is the best imaging modality?

8
00:00:31,673 --> 00:00:33,445
Did you guess it?

9
00:00:33,445 --> 00:00:37,634
Well, you might know that we are doing
a lot of magnetic resonance imaging,

10
00:00:37,634 --> 00:00:40,326
so you might expect
that the politically correct answer

11
00:00:40,326 --> 00:00:41,635
is MRI.

12
00:00:42,245 --> 00:00:44,016
Well, that is wrong.

13
00:00:44,016 --> 00:00:48,255
There is no such thing
as a perfect imaging modality.

14
00:00:48,255 --> 00:00:49,757
And what's really important here

15
00:00:49,757 --> 00:00:52,296
is each one of them
has its strengths and weaknesses,

16
00:00:52,296 --> 00:00:54,529
has its domains of application,

17
00:00:54,529 --> 00:01:01,266
and therefore is best used
for certain applications.

18
00:01:01,856 --> 00:01:04,197
So I want to first discuss here,

19
00:01:04,197 --> 00:01:07,146
the contrast mechanisms and limitations.

20
00:01:07,146 --> 00:01:09,817
So on the left we'll have
the contrast mechanisms,

21
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:15,189
and on the right the major limitations
for each of the techniques.

22
00:01:15,769 --> 00:01:18,178
Computer tomography, or X-ray,

23
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:21,627
primarily has as its contrast mechanism,

24
00:01:21,627 --> 00:01:25,330
the electron density 
and the effective atomic number <i>Z</i>.

25
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,248
What are its limitations?

26
00:01:28,248 --> 00:01:33,312
It is essentially limited 
to strong electron density differences--

27
00:01:33,312 --> 00:01:36,900
so it's bone tissue
or air tissue interfaces,

28
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,973
where we have strong
electron density variations.

29
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:46,111
The other limitation
is that it uses ionizing radiation.

30
00:01:47,091 --> 00:01:49,771
If we look at the emission
computer tomography techniques--

31
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:53,803
SPECT, single-photon emitters,
and PET, positron emitters--

32
00:01:55,113 --> 00:01:57,302
the contrast mechanism here
is the distribution

33
00:01:57,302 --> 00:02:01,212
of the exogenously-administered
tracer in the tissue.

34
00:02:01,212 --> 00:02:03,603
So we administer a radioactive substance,

35
00:02:03,603 --> 00:02:05,214
a decaying substance,

36
00:02:05,214 --> 00:02:08,343
measure its radioactivity, measure
that distribution of the radioactivity,

37
00:02:08,343 --> 00:02:09,825
in the tissue.

38
00:02:10,545 --> 00:02:15,375
These techniques are limited
to the Î³ emitters that are available,

39
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:21,395
and, in general, they don't have uniform
spatial resolution and/or sensitivity;

40
00:02:21,395 --> 00:02:23,673
we have seen the impact of collimation

41
00:02:23,673 --> 00:02:26,993
on the spatial resolution for SPECT;

42
00:02:26,993 --> 00:02:33,406
we have also seen the impact
of the scintillation crystal dimensions

43
00:02:33,406 --> 00:02:35,721
on spatial resolution of PET,

44
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:40,138
and that sensitivity
is not necessarily uniform either.

45
00:02:41,068 --> 00:02:42,937
How about magnetic resonance?

46
00:02:42,937 --> 00:02:47,540
Magnetic resonance is, the signal is
proportional to equilibrium magnetization,

47
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:51,379
so, in essence, physically it measures
the spin concentration.

48
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,189
I'm not putting it here
as a contrast mechanism <i>fully</i>;

49
00:02:54,189 --> 00:02:57,710
it's in parenthesis because
there is not a lot of contrast

50
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:59,779
from the spin concentration--

51
00:02:59,779 --> 00:03:02,749
that is, the concentration
of water in tissue, per se.

52
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:07,621
The major mechanism that we have discussed
and that is being used

53
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:09,778
are the relaxation processes--

54
00:03:09,778 --> 00:03:14,921
the relaxation of magnetization
is the major mechanism

55
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:16,751
that produces contrast.

56
00:03:17,301 --> 00:03:20,371
We have also seen that with spectroscopy

57
00:03:20,371 --> 00:03:23,642
one can distinguish
the chemical environment

58
00:03:23,642 --> 00:03:29,092
of the hydrogen nucleus in the tissue,

59
00:03:29,092 --> 00:03:32,004
and for MRI, the major application here

60
00:03:32,004 --> 00:03:35,874
is to distinguish whether the signal
that one observes is due to fat or water,

61
00:03:35,874 --> 00:03:38,304
based on the chemical shift.

62
00:03:38,874 --> 00:03:41,283
We have also--that is this week--

63
00:03:41,283 --> 00:03:44,218
discussed the effect
of motion and diffusion.

64
00:03:44,218 --> 00:03:47,295
So these are the major
contrast mechanisms

65
00:03:47,295 --> 00:03:50,454
that we have discussed in this course.

66
00:03:51,304 --> 00:03:53,616
But I'll put <i>etc.</i> here-- 
there are, of course,

67
00:03:53,616 --> 00:03:56,210
many more contrast mechanisms for MRI

68
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:58,276
that we have not discussed in this course.

69
00:03:58,276 --> 00:04:04,668
We have stuck here
to some of the main features

70
00:04:04,668 --> 00:04:08,116
of mechanisms
that contribute to contrast.

71
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:09,707
There are, of course, many more

72
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:13,538
that can be exploited in MRI.

73
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:19,047
The limitation of magnetic resonance
is its sensitivity.

74
00:04:20,327 --> 00:04:23,069
While we can imagine
imaging a few picomolar

75
00:04:23,069 --> 00:04:25,898
of positron emitters in the body,

76
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:30,909
a few picomolar of spins is not
going to give us a measurable signal;

77
00:04:30,909 --> 00:04:33,880
we're stuck here
with a low-sensitivity technique.

78
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:38,299
This is compensated by using the signal
of water with the Boltzmann distribution.

79
00:04:38,299 --> 00:04:42,371
This gives, however, then,
again, a strong signal.

80
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:47,517
The other part is, the measurement
is time-consuming and motion-sensitive.

81
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:50,511
It typically, for an image,
takes a few minutes.

82
00:04:50,511 --> 00:04:52,812
It's very motion-sensitive--

83
00:04:52,812 --> 00:04:58,389
compare this with CT where the image
can be obtained in a few seconds.

84
00:04:58,389 --> 00:05:03,610
And another limitation is,
it is of course, a complex methodology.

85
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,965
We have so many different mechanisms
that contribute to contrast--

86
00:05:06,965 --> 00:05:11,583
that means we have so many different
ways of manipulating the magnetization--

87
00:05:11,583 --> 00:05:15,193
that this results, in the end,
in a complex methodology

88
00:05:15,193 --> 00:05:18,645
that needs to be
carefully mastered and controlled

89
00:05:18,645 --> 00:05:22,633
to produce reproducible results.

90
00:05:24,403 --> 00:05:26,587
Lastly, the ultrasound technique,

91
00:05:26,587 --> 00:05:30,328
which we introduced at the beginning
of Module 1 of this course,

92
00:05:30,328 --> 00:05:35,216
it detects the boundaries
between two tissues

93
00:05:35,216 --> 00:05:39,937
with different mechanical properties
from the acoustic impedance.

94
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:44,607
That is determining
the creation of an echo.

95
00:05:45,327 --> 00:05:49,978
The down-side is that ultrasound
does not penetrate hard objects--

96
00:05:49,978 --> 00:05:51,789
so, not through bone.

97
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:53,939
If you want to do
an ultrasound of the brain,

98
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:56,428
it is not easily done in adults.

99
00:05:56,428 --> 00:06:00,458
It is done in newborns
where the skull is still open,

100
00:06:00,458 --> 00:06:01,869
this bone has not closed yet.

101
00:06:01,869 --> 00:06:04,491
Someone can put the transducer
here on the top of the head

102
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:07,121
and obtain an ultrasound of the brain

103
00:06:07,121 --> 00:06:09,820
in newborn babies.

104
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,379
So, I want to continue with the comparison
of the techniques here

105
00:06:14,379 --> 00:06:18,501
and first address the question,
how do we maximize sensitivity?

106
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:23,692
For computer tomography,
this is actually relatively simply done--

107
00:06:23,692 --> 00:06:25,572
we increase the radiation dose;

108
00:06:25,572 --> 00:06:28,641
we bombard the organ with more photons

109
00:06:28,641 --> 00:06:31,774
then we increase the sensitivity there.

110
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:34,617
So we increase the radiation dose;
practically, this is done

111
00:06:34,617 --> 00:06:41,606
by increasing 
the filament current and voltage.

112
00:06:42,326 --> 00:06:45,454
For the techniques SPECT and PET,

113
00:06:45,454 --> 00:06:48,653
we can increase the tracer dose--

114
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:54,824
so this will increase the number
of radiotracers in the tissue

115
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:57,555
and therefore increase
the number of events, the photons,

116
00:06:57,555 --> 00:06:59,566
that one can detect.

117
00:06:59,566 --> 00:07:02,064
And, finally, for magnetic resonance,

118
00:07:02,064 --> 00:07:07,404
we can increase one parameter
and that's the magnetic field.

119
00:07:07,404 --> 00:07:09,696
Remember, the sensitivity
for magnetic resonance

120
00:07:09,696 --> 00:07:11,760
is determined 
by the equilibrium magnetization--

121
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:14,209
that's the strongest signal one can get--

122
00:07:14,209 --> 00:07:16,285
and that is proportional
to the magnetic field;

123
00:07:16,285 --> 00:07:18,696
that is the major factor with which

124
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:23,882
one can experimentally
increase the sensitivity.

125
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:27,588
So, what are these increases limited by?

126
00:07:28,128 --> 00:07:31,587
In CT, essentially nothing,
except for, in human application,

127
00:07:31,587 --> 00:07:33,297
the radiation dose--

128
00:07:33,297 --> 00:07:40,180
we cannot just bombard our patient
with unlimited amounts of radiation.

129
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:46,000
Same holds true for the emission computer
tomography techniques like SPECT and PET;

130
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,500
however, there is another effect--
even if you stay within the limits,

131
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:55,310
as you increase the number
of decays in the body,

132
00:07:55,310 --> 00:07:58,772
the probability of scattering increases

133
00:07:58,772 --> 00:08:05,562
and therefore the probability
of random events increases,

134
00:08:05,562 --> 00:08:11,818
and therefore, the dose is limited
by these kind of events;

135
00:08:11,818 --> 00:08:15,282
we have only a finite
coincidence interval for PET,

136
00:08:15,282 --> 00:08:18,163
it cannot go for infinitely short
coincidence intervals,

137
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,953
and at some point the randoms

138
00:08:19,953 --> 00:08:21,903
and the scatter will take over

139
00:08:21,903 --> 00:08:28,843
the gains in sensitivity from increasing
the tracer dose, and it goes down.

140
00:08:28,843 --> 00:08:33,995
So there is a optimum sensitivity
that one can get.

141
00:08:33,995 --> 00:08:35,965
And magnetization?

142
00:08:35,965 --> 00:08:39,185
For MR, it is limited 
by the equilibrium magnetization

143
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,636
due through the Boltzmann distribution.

144
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:43,091
Those are the limits there.

145
00:08:43,091 --> 00:08:49,324
Now, we have to think of the cost
or the implications of this:

146
00:08:49,324 --> 00:08:52,725
increase in radiation dose:
increase in the filament current.

147
00:08:52,725 --> 00:08:55,916
That is just dialing up
the current on the filament,

148
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,248
so it's heating the filament more.

149
00:08:58,248 --> 00:09:00,499
Increasing the tracer dose
is more expensive;

150
00:09:00,499 --> 00:09:04,008
we inject more molecules,
[inaudible] have to synthesize more.

151
00:09:04,008 --> 00:09:08,286
Increase in the magnetic field--it's not
just increasing the current in the magnet,

152
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:10,779
it is actually building a new magnet,

153
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:13,900
and this is very costly
and not easily done.

154
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:20,029
So it is a trend of our time that
we go to higher and higher fields.

155
00:09:20,029 --> 00:09:23,079
Now, what about
the cost of these techniques?

156
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:27,530
We had ultrasound, which is not
on this list here because I excluded it;

157
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:32,475
ultrasound is the cheapest modality
of the modalities discussed.

158
00:09:32,475 --> 00:09:34,641
Then it's CT.

159
00:09:35,481 --> 00:09:40,102
Then comes SPECT
for instrumentation purposes.

160
00:09:41,452 --> 00:09:44,773
The next more expensive technique is PET,

161
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:48,213
if one neglects the cost
of producing the isotopes.

162
00:09:48,213 --> 00:09:53,171
If you include the radiochemistry unit,
that produces the isotopes on site,

163
00:09:53,981 --> 00:09:59,434
then you have to think of a cyclotron
that you have to buy and maintain

164
00:09:59,434 --> 00:10:03,293
and a team of radiochemists--
that makes the cost different.

165
00:10:03,293 --> 00:10:05,535
If you can buy it from elsewhere

166
00:10:05,535 --> 00:10:07,763
then the scanner itself
is a bit more expensive

167
00:10:07,763 --> 00:10:09,426
than the SPECT scanner.

168
00:10:09,426 --> 00:10:13,955
And, finally, MRIs are 
the most expensive instruments to buy.

169
00:10:15,475 --> 00:10:19,274
There the price increases
with magnetic field.

170
00:10:19,274 --> 00:10:24,737
We have high-end academic
or clinical MRIs at 3 Tesla,

171
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:30,838
and some scanners now are available
for human experimentation at 7 Tesla.

172
00:10:30,838 --> 00:10:32,952
So the cost goes--

173
00:10:32,952 --> 00:10:37,858
as we have introduced the techniques
in the course, the cost has increased.

174
00:10:39,598 --> 00:10:41,324
So, image reconstruction--

175
00:10:41,324 --> 00:10:44,268
I want to look 
at how image reconstruction is done,

176
00:10:44,268 --> 00:10:45,648
summarize that.

177
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:49,020
For CT, SPECT and PET,
the image reconstruction

178
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,530
depends crucially on knowing
the directionality of the photon.

179
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:59,201
In CT it's done by the emission
of the photon and the detection,

180
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:04,364
this gives a line;
together with an anti-scatter grid,

181
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,601
this gives us the directionality
of the photon--there it's defined.

182
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:09,601
For SPECT we do collimation--

183
00:11:09,601 --> 00:11:12,001
this defines the directionality
of the photon.

184
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,494
And for PET we have coincidence detection;

185
00:11:14,494 --> 00:11:18,074
from the simultaneity of events,
the directionality of the photons

186
00:11:18,074 --> 00:11:19,584
are established.

187
00:11:19,584 --> 00:11:22,058
And we have seen, 
once we have the directionality

188
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:25,613
of the detection process, of the photons,

189
00:11:25,613 --> 00:11:28,193
we can write the signal
that is being measured

190
00:11:28,193 --> 00:11:30,344
in the form of a Radon transform,

191
00:11:30,344 --> 00:11:32,654
and once we have a Radon transform,

192
00:11:32,654 --> 00:11:36,545
we can use projection reconstruction
to reconstruct the image.

193
00:11:36,545 --> 00:11:38,863
So for these techniques,
projection reconstruction

194
00:11:38,863 --> 00:11:43,515
is a major method of image reconstruction.

195
00:11:43,515 --> 00:11:45,810
For magnetic resonance,

196
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,854
the image reconstruction
is based on a different mechanism,

197
00:11:50,854 --> 00:11:53,912
it's based on the precession
of the transverse magnetization,

198
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:55,997
under the influence of a gradient.

199
00:11:55,997 --> 00:11:58,721
So the precession frequency
depends on position,

200
00:11:58,721 --> 00:12:01,647
and one does a frequency analysis

201
00:12:01,647 --> 00:12:04,257
of the signal that's being registered.

202
00:12:04,997 --> 00:12:07,048
A frequency analysis
of the signal being registered

203
00:12:07,048 --> 00:12:09,888
basically means
we're doing a Fourier transform.

204
00:12:09,888 --> 00:12:11,706
So while we have,
for the X-ray techniques,

205
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:17,257
projection reconstruction as the
preferred image reconstruction approach,

206
00:12:17,257 --> 00:12:21,147
for magnetic resonance
we have Fourier transformation

207
00:12:21,147 --> 00:12:25,426
which is the widely used
gold standard in this technique.

208
00:12:26,656 --> 00:12:28,929
Finally, a word on contrast agents.

209
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:32,721
As a reminder, contrast agents are
substances that are injected into the body

210
00:12:32,721 --> 00:12:37,748
that change the contrast
of the image modality.

211
00:12:37,748 --> 00:12:41,031
We've had, in CT and X-ray,
the contrast agents

212
00:12:41,031 --> 00:12:43,762
are typically compounds with high <i>Z</i>.

213
00:12:43,762 --> 00:12:46,400
We have seen the example in Lecture 3

214
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:50,204
that just a few millimolar
of a high <i>Z</i> component

215
00:12:50,204 --> 00:12:55,173
can produce a strong change
in the linear attenuation coefficient.

216
00:12:55,173 --> 00:12:59,583
Most compounds that are used
are iodine-based for CT,

217
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:02,672
but we've also had
the example of gadolinium.

218
00:13:03,212 --> 00:13:05,367
And, for magnetic resonance,

219
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:10,115
the contrast agents are compounds
that shorten the relaxation times,

220
00:13:10,115 --> 00:13:13,120
be it <i>T_1</i>, <i>T_2</i>, or <i>T_2 star</i>.

221
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,592
There is no contrast agent
that can prolong the relaxation time.

222
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:20,394
The contrast agents in MR

223
00:13:22,304 --> 00:13:25,526
are typically lanthonides like gadolinium,

224
00:13:25,526 --> 00:13:27,699
they are molecules that are paramagnetic,

225
00:13:27,699 --> 00:13:31,167
they have unpaired electrons in the atoms.

226
00:13:31,167 --> 00:13:33,926
These unpaired electrons
carry a magnetic spin,

227
00:13:33,926 --> 00:13:36,927
so they increase the fluctuation
of the magnetic field

228
00:13:36,927 --> 00:13:41,885
and therefore, they can only do so
by shortening the relaxation times.

229
00:13:42,895 --> 00:13:45,861
So these are the major contrast agents

230
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:48,948
that we have discussed in this course.

231
00:13:50,518 --> 00:13:54,580
So now, what is the
right bioimaging modality?

232
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:58,289
This is a question that one
is very often confronted with

233
00:13:58,289 --> 00:14:03,130
and it is useful to know
some basic considerations.

234
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:06,281
These are general considerations,

235
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:10,030
they may vary in specific cases,
but I've tried to do here a sort of

236
00:14:10,030 --> 00:14:13,971
a general chart to guide us a little bit

237
00:14:13,971 --> 00:14:17,251
on what we would consider.

238
00:14:18,651 --> 00:14:22,852
Well, if we want a rapid
and least invasive assessment

239
00:14:22,852 --> 00:14:25,494
of a tissue that's fairly close
to the surface--

240
00:14:27,194 --> 00:14:30,071
so rapid, least invasive,

241
00:14:30,071 --> 00:14:33,774
least intrusive,
nearly bedside, or bedside,

242
00:14:33,774 --> 00:14:36,582
and it's tissue close to the surface--

243
00:14:36,582 --> 00:14:40,214
in this case, ultrasound is the technique
that one would want to choose.

244
00:14:41,674 --> 00:14:43,284
There's a limitation though--

245
00:14:43,284 --> 00:14:46,392
if, between the tissue
that you're interested in,

246
00:14:46,392 --> 00:14:48,935
and the detector, the transducer--

247
00:14:48,935 --> 00:14:51,184
if there is air or bone between,

248
00:14:51,184 --> 00:14:54,334
that creates artifacts,
in that case it's not a good choice.

249
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:58,963
I mention the air here because
this is one of the major reasons

250
00:14:58,963 --> 00:15:02,434
why one uses the ultrasound gel
on the transducer,

251
00:15:02,434 --> 00:15:05,886
put on the skin so that there are
no air pockets in there

252
00:15:05,886 --> 00:15:08,508
that produce these artifacts.

253
00:15:09,838 --> 00:15:13,448
If one is interested in a rapid scan
with high spatial resolution,

254
00:15:13,448 --> 00:15:18,048
and/or contrast between air tissue
and bone tissue,

255
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,868
then the technique to use is X-ray.

256
00:15:21,868 --> 00:15:23,810
We've discussed here in the course

257
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:26,910
the 2-D imaging technique,
computer tomography.

258
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:31,395
This can scan very rapidly

259
00:15:31,395 --> 00:15:35,870
and the primary contrast that's produced
is between air tissue and bone tissue.

260
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,541
Finally, if one is interested 
in metabolism, imaging receptors,

261
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:44,911
glucose metabolism,
transport and perfusion,

262
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:49,872
then one has SPECT and PET
as the techniques to be used here--

263
00:15:49,872 --> 00:15:52,516
the metabolic imaging techniques

264
00:15:52,516 --> 00:15:54,974
and blood flow imaging techniques,

265
00:15:54,974 --> 00:15:58,344
the emission computed tomography, SPECT,

266
00:15:58,344 --> 00:16:02,133
and positron emission
tomography techniques.

267
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,403
If you'd like to know something

268
00:16:05,403 --> 00:16:07,526
about the biochemical information 
of tissue,

269
00:16:07,526 --> 00:16:10,034
then we have NMR spectroscopy,

270
00:16:10,034 --> 00:16:12,885
the chemical information
that magnetic resonance provides

271
00:16:12,885 --> 00:16:14,765
can give us important insight

272
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,475
into the biochemical composition 
of tissue,

273
00:16:17,475 --> 00:16:20,615
for example, in diagnostic MRI,

274
00:16:22,395 --> 00:16:29,215
the distinction between fat and water
is very often used.

275
00:16:30,505 --> 00:16:33,626
If you would like to have
exquisite soft tissue contrast

276
00:16:33,626 --> 00:16:37,597
with millimeter spatial resolution,
in rodent's 100 microns,

277
00:16:38,617 --> 00:16:44,747
the exquisite soft tissue contrast,
then MRI is your technique to use.

278
00:16:44,747 --> 00:16:49,370
Contrast this with X-ray--
it's fast, but the soft tissue contrast

279
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,950
and what is between soft tissues,

280
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:53,168
the electron density 
doesn't vary enormously,

281
00:16:53,168 --> 00:16:55,710
it is much more difficult to see.

282
00:16:55,710 --> 00:17:01,229
MRI there provides an abundance
of contrast in the tissue.

283
00:17:02,789 --> 00:17:07,218
The limitation for MRI
is that immobile spins,

284
00:17:08,808 --> 00:17:14,157
although they carry a magnetization,
their magnetization, once it's excited,

285
00:17:14,157 --> 00:17:17,371
the transverse relaxation,
be it <i>T_2</i> or <i>T_2 star</i>,

286
00:17:17,371 --> 00:17:22,051
is so fast that for practical reasons,
it's very difficult, if not impossible,

287
00:17:22,051 --> 00:17:24,640
to reliably image.

288
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,072
Some specialized acquisitions occur
but as a general rule of thumb,

289
00:17:29,072 --> 00:17:34,352
it is not observable,
so membranes, cell membranes,

290
00:17:34,352 --> 00:17:38,181
don't produce a measurable signal,
although they carry a magnetization,

291
00:17:38,181 --> 00:17:40,364
and bones typically doesn't.

292
00:17:40,364 --> 00:17:43,944
So compare that to CT--
bone is the major contrast mechanism;

293
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:48,393
in MRI, bone is not contributing
to the signal.

294
00:17:50,253 --> 00:17:52,821
If one wishes to get
functional information,

295
00:17:52,821 --> 00:17:55,386
then the technique to use here is MRI,

296
00:17:55,386 --> 00:17:57,685
particularly in the brain
with functional MRI

297
00:17:57,685 --> 00:17:59,464
or BOLD fMRI-- we've discussed that.

298
00:18:00,284 --> 00:18:04,665
This is based on the deoxygenation
of the blood vessels in the brain.

299
00:18:05,605 --> 00:18:08,006
It has, 25 years ago, replaced PET

300
00:18:08,006 --> 00:18:11,206
as the premier functional 
imaging technique,

301
00:18:11,206 --> 00:18:16,349
this is now being done
with magnetic resonance imaging.

302
00:18:18,489 --> 00:18:20,938
This technique, <i>T_2 star</i>-weighted imaging,

303
00:18:20,938 --> 00:18:26,850
is not very applicable
close to air tissue interfaces,

304
00:18:26,850 --> 00:18:30,389
so the sinuses in the head,
the ear canals,

305
00:18:30,389 --> 00:18:33,339
these produce, on these images,
signal fallouts,

306
00:18:33,339 --> 00:18:35,799
which are not easily recoverable.

307
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:40,619
So it's hard to measure activation
very close to these tissue interfaces,

308
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,969
such as the nucleus accumbens
in the brain,

309
00:18:42,969 --> 00:18:45,109
the olfactory bulb in humans--

310
00:18:45,109 --> 00:18:48,516
in rats it's easier, the olfactory bulb
is just sitting under the snout.

311
00:18:49,226 --> 00:18:52,349
And finally, if one wants 
to image moving blood--

312
00:18:52,349 --> 00:18:54,032
that's angiography--

313
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,370
we actually have a number
of techniques available.

314
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,662
With MRI--I've given you
in this week's lecture at the beginning

315
00:19:00,662 --> 00:19:03,949
an example of how MRI 
can encode moving blood.

316
00:19:03,949 --> 00:19:08,733
But there are multiple ways to do this
aside from what I've shown you today.

317
00:19:08,733 --> 00:19:10,452
In computer tomography,

318
00:19:10,452 --> 00:19:14,131
one can depict the blood vessels
with contrast agents

319
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:17,404
and, of course, with Doppler ultrasound,

320
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:23,084
we can also detect moving blood,
and there, we can even do it in real time.

321
00:19:23,984 --> 00:19:28,840
So these are some rough charts.

322
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:32,586
What is our interest?
What is the preferred technology there?

323
00:19:32,586 --> 00:19:36,184
We have to consider some limitations
for the X-ray techniques

324
00:19:36,184 --> 00:19:40,967
and that is multiple exposures
limit it's applicability--

325
00:19:40,967 --> 00:19:43,666
you do not want to go
ten times a year into a CT scanner,

326
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,814
if you're a healthy young volunteer.

327
00:19:46,264 --> 00:19:50,677
However, if the condition
is life-threatening, it may matter less.

328
00:19:50,677 --> 00:19:52,329
I'll come with an example.

329
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,977
And for everything that has to do
with magnetic resonance,

330
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:57,407
we have to consider
that we have a big magnet,

331
00:19:57,407 --> 00:20:01,406
if you carry a pace-maker,
an insulin pump,

332
00:20:01,406 --> 00:20:04,908
a defibrillator, in your body,
or metallic implants,

333
00:20:05,808 --> 00:20:08,974
then this is not the technique
for you to be used.

334
00:20:09,594 --> 00:20:11,630
You're excluded from this technique.

335
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:16,840
So consider, as an example, you have
a subject that comes to the clinic.

336
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,779
He's unconscious,
probably had a stroke in the brain,

337
00:20:19,779 --> 00:20:25,251
and one wants to determine
the extent of the stroke, for example,

338
00:20:25,251 --> 00:20:27,481
or whether it's indeed a stroke.

339
00:20:27,481 --> 00:20:29,641
Typically, one way to detect this

340
00:20:29,641 --> 00:20:32,461
is the mid-line in the brain
is displaced in one direction.

341
00:20:35,071 --> 00:20:36,704
The person is an elderly person,

342
00:20:37,824 --> 00:20:40,433
you do not want to put them
necessarily into an MRI

343
00:20:40,433 --> 00:20:41,605
unless you're absolutely sure

344
00:20:41,605 --> 00:20:44,454
there's no pacemaker
or any metallic implant in the body--

345
00:20:44,454 --> 00:20:47,195
the consequences are devastating.

346
00:20:47,195 --> 00:20:50,494
However, to just detect
whether the mid-line is displaced

347
00:20:50,494 --> 00:20:54,025
in the CT there's sufficient contrast,
this is done in a few seconds,

348
00:20:54,025 --> 00:20:58,115
it's also fast, gives you
a fast assessment in this case.

349
00:20:58,115 --> 00:21:01,915
So there you would use--
even though the soft tissue contrast

350
00:21:03,475 --> 00:21:05,777
is not very good, it is sufficient

351
00:21:05,777 --> 00:21:09,286
to detect the medical question at hand.

352
00:21:09,846 --> 00:21:14,885
Likewise, if you have a tumor
with a chance for treatment,

353
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:19,248
and a PET or SPECT scan

354
00:21:19,248 --> 00:21:24,484
allows you to determine the area
of the neoplastic cells--

355
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:27,348
that is the cells
that multiply and divide--

356
00:21:28,938 --> 00:21:34,018
you might have the choice between
not being properly treated and dying,

357
00:21:34,018 --> 00:21:37,490
or the choice of being
overexposed to X-rays,

358
00:21:38,010 --> 00:21:41,230
and <i>potentially</i> dying from cancer later,

359
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:44,810
induced by the X-rays.

360
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:48,698
So in this case, the choice is a question
of which one is worse,

361
00:21:48,698 --> 00:21:51,107
or the choice of the lesser evil,

362
00:21:51,107 --> 00:21:54,090
and one might want 
to stick with the CT techniques.

363
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,859
So that's the overview of the techniques.

364
00:21:56,859 --> 00:22:01,730
In the next section I will just do
a visual summary, with examples,

365
00:22:01,730 --> 00:22:05,152
of the imaging modalities in the course.

366
00:22:06,952 --> 00:22:11,042
Let's look at an example
of the different modalities for the brain.

367
00:22:11,832 --> 00:22:13,961
If we look at the skull--
for X-ray imaging,

368
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:20,976
the skull has a lot of electron density,
calcium, so there's more scattering,

369
00:22:20,976 --> 00:22:24,721
it get's in the way of brain imaging.

370
00:22:24,721 --> 00:22:27,394
So it is not as good a technique.

371
00:22:27,394 --> 00:22:31,083
And so here we're looking at an image now,
this image has been skull-stripped,

372
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:35,012
now this is not what it implies,
physically,

373
00:22:35,012 --> 00:22:37,566
it's not stripping the skull
off the patient,

374
00:22:37,566 --> 00:22:39,703
it's stripping it by software means,

375
00:22:39,703 --> 00:22:41,247
so we don't see the signal from the skull,

376
00:22:41,247 --> 00:22:43,747
we're just looking at the soft tissue.

377
00:22:43,747 --> 00:22:45,009
And you can see on the left,

378
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:47,069
we have exquisite contrast
with the gray-white matter,

379
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:50,877
and on the right, on the CT scan,
it is essentially grayish

380
00:22:50,877 --> 00:22:53,937
for the same slice in the same subject,

381
00:22:53,937 --> 00:22:58,082
we're seeing not as much contrast
on the CT scan.

382
00:22:59,832 --> 00:23:02,257
Here we compare a PET scan on the right--

383
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,209
we have an area of high uptake,

384
00:23:04,209 --> 00:23:05,898
and on the <i>T_1</i>-weighted image,

385
00:23:05,898 --> 00:23:09,730
we're seeing here an alteration
on the image here,

386
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:14,200
and what the PET scan tells us,
the location of where there is

387
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:17,932
the uptake
of this particular tracer, FBPA.

388
00:23:17,932 --> 00:23:21,459
Here's an example from a macaque brain,

389
00:23:21,459 --> 00:23:24,774
this is a <i>T_1</i>-weighted image
of the brain--

390
00:23:24,774 --> 00:23:26,258
we see some gyrification.

391
00:23:26,258 --> 00:23:29,031
This is a <i>T_2</i>-weighted image--
we see alteration here;

392
00:23:29,031 --> 00:23:30,833
this image is flipped,

393
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:33,752
so we have here
the uptake of the PET tracer

394
00:23:33,752 --> 00:23:36,873
corresponding to this area.

395
00:23:37,543 --> 00:23:39,493
Looking at contrast agents,

396
00:23:39,493 --> 00:23:41,793
we can see four images here.

397
00:23:42,563 --> 00:23:46,931
Take a few seconds and guess 
which one is the CT scan,

398
00:23:46,931 --> 00:23:48,460
which one is the MRI scan...

399
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:52,075
Did you guess it?

400
00:23:52,075 --> 00:23:54,527
Guess which one has the contrast agent:

401
00:23:54,527 --> 00:23:56,805
which one is before, which one is after?

402
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:01,627
Okay. So the top row is a CT scan--

403
00:24:01,627 --> 00:24:03,875
we can see the bone very bright,

404
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:06,205
the soft tissue contrast is not exquisite,

405
00:24:06,205 --> 00:24:10,135
on the MRI we see the fat
and we have exquisite soft tissue contrast

406
00:24:10,135 --> 00:24:12,287
in the MRI.

407
00:24:13,667 --> 00:24:18,286
And we see, on the left,
the pre-contrast agent administration--

408
00:24:18,286 --> 00:24:21,715
so that's the native image,
we see something is going on here--

409
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:24,806
now here on the MRI,
the contrast agent tells us,

410
00:24:24,806 --> 00:24:26,686
at the periphery of this lesion,

411
00:24:26,686 --> 00:24:29,096
there's a lot of uptake
for the contrast agent.

412
00:24:29,096 --> 00:24:32,567
Contrast agents for MRI
are typically limited to the blood,

413
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:34,662
so if we see uptake into the tissue,

414
00:24:34,662 --> 00:24:38,149
it means that that part of the
blood-brain barrier has been ruptured--

415
00:24:38,149 --> 00:24:39,909
these are, of course, brain scans--

416
00:24:39,909 --> 00:24:46,124
and this is typically the zone
where the aggressive cancerous cells are.

417
00:24:46,124 --> 00:24:48,620
The inside does not have much blood flow,

418
00:24:48,620 --> 00:24:50,988
so it's most likely a necrotic core.

419
00:24:50,988 --> 00:24:52,730
Likewise, here with the CT scan,

420
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,747
one can see some alteration
of the normal structure,

421
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:58,249
and the one sees here,
where the arrows point,

422
00:24:58,249 --> 00:25:00,219
the uptake of the contrast agent

423
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:03,820
at the edge of the tumor--

424
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,831
this is where the blood-brain barrier
has been ruptured,

425
00:25:06,831 --> 00:25:10,970
where there is vascularization
and aggressive growth of cells.

426
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:15,011
Here's an example
of a high-grade astrocytoma.

427
00:25:16,121 --> 00:25:19,051
We have four different contrasts
to consider:

428
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:22,722
<i>T_1</i>-weighted image
after contrast administration

429
00:25:22,722 --> 00:25:26,592
gives us here the rim of the tumor--

430
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:28,503
this is post-contrast;

431
00:25:28,503 --> 00:25:30,744
we have the <i>T_2</i>-weighted image,

432
00:25:30,744 --> 00:25:33,692
at 30 milliseconds,
one sees something going on here--

433
00:25:33,692 --> 00:25:36,495
at 30 milliseconds,
80 milliseconds very clear,

434
00:25:36,495 --> 00:25:39,593
that <i>T_2</i> in this area of the brain
has been prolonged.

435
00:25:39,593 --> 00:25:43,692
A longer <i>T_2</i>--and <i>T_2</i>-weighted image
bright means longer <i>T_2</i>--

436
00:25:43,692 --> 00:25:48,176
a longer <i>T_2</i> means disruption
of cellular membranes,

437
00:25:48,176 --> 00:25:50,976
of proteins and so on,
there's less of that,

438
00:25:50,976 --> 00:25:57,709
the fluid content of the brain
has increased.

439
00:25:58,399 --> 00:26:02,447
This is a hallmark of tumors
but it's also a hallmark of edema,

440
00:26:02,447 --> 00:26:04,758
so these two cannot be distinguished.

441
00:26:04,758 --> 00:26:08,458
Well, we see here, there's
a diffuse hyperintensity in this area,

442
00:26:08,458 --> 00:26:09,907
all over the area,

443
00:26:09,907 --> 00:26:14,917
we see there is a rim of high-uptake
of the contrast agent,

444
00:26:14,917 --> 00:26:16,729
there's the vascularization,

445
00:26:16,729 --> 00:26:19,217
and, if one now includes the FDG-PET scan,

446
00:26:19,217 --> 00:26:22,157
one can see the uptake
of glucose at this point.

447
00:26:22,157 --> 00:26:26,890
This is the point where the cells are
that have a high glucose metabolic rate,

448
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:29,780
they are most likely
the cells that one wants to get out

449
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:33,541
to stop the proliferation
and the growth of the tumor.

450
00:26:33,541 --> 00:26:36,983
Most likely, what we have in here,
inside here,

451
00:26:36,983 --> 00:26:38,930
is necrosis and we can indeed see

452
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,649
there's very little uptake
of glucose at this point.

453
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:46,642
The rest that shows up bright
on the <i>T_2</i>-weighted image, hyperintense--

454
00:26:46,642 --> 00:26:50,082
like I said, it's a reduction 
of relative presence

455
00:26:50,082 --> 00:26:51,712
of membranes and so on--

456
00:26:51,712 --> 00:26:56,633
is most likely a reflection of edema--
so it's peritumoral edema--

457
00:26:56,633 --> 00:27:00,660
that creates the increase
in <i>T_2</i> in this image, most likely.

458
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:06,090
So the arrow here highlights the area
where one would go for, say,

459
00:27:06,090 --> 00:27:09,956
surgical or radiotherapy treatment.

460
00:27:11,936 --> 00:27:16,433
Now, I want to give
some final examples from the body.

461
00:27:16,433 --> 00:27:19,316
This is a whole body PET scan,
on the left,

462
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:22,523
and a whole body MRI scan;

463
00:27:22,523 --> 00:27:25,916
they are clearly different contrast--
MRI being soft tissue,

464
00:27:25,916 --> 00:27:28,416
PET, depending on the tracer
that one uses,

465
00:27:28,416 --> 00:27:31,096
one traces a different process.

466
00:27:31,096 --> 00:27:35,935
Here's a higher resolution--
a 3-D CT of a mouse.

467
00:27:35,935 --> 00:27:39,405
We can see the skeleton
very nicely depicted,

468
00:27:39,405 --> 00:27:41,597
grayish is the contrast
of the other things,

469
00:27:41,597 --> 00:27:46,344
but the skeleton depicts very nicely
in three dimensions.

470
00:27:47,744 --> 00:27:52,149
SPECT images of the heart
measuring heart perfusion on the bottom--

471
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:55,141
so this is indicating
a perfusion in the muscle--

472
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:58,319
this in the MRI is the muscle
and the bright area here,

473
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:00,373
that's the ventricle filled with blood;

474
00:28:00,373 --> 00:28:02,580
that's what we're pumping
roughly every second

475
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:04,390
through our circulation.

476
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:06,911
That's the job of the heart.

477
00:28:06,911 --> 00:28:08,732
Here's an example of the lung--

478
00:28:08,732 --> 00:28:10,701
it's a cystic fibrosis example--

479
00:28:11,701 --> 00:28:15,178
we have on the top:
can you guess what modality that is?

480
00:28:16,258 --> 00:28:19,762
We can see bone,
we can see the ribcage, so it is CT,

481
00:28:19,762 --> 00:28:22,154
and on the bottom we have MRI.

482
00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:26,657
And we can see here in this case
that there is something inside the lung

483
00:28:27,477 --> 00:28:29,861
that shouldn't be there--
the lung should just be air.

484
00:28:29,861 --> 00:28:32,662
So it should not be detectable
with MRI and with CT,

485
00:28:32,662 --> 00:28:37,942
and this is, in this case
of cystic fibrosis,

486
00:28:37,942 --> 00:28:40,404
is a major complication of this disease.

487
00:28:40,964 --> 00:28:44,125
Some of you might have had pneumonia--

488
00:28:44,125 --> 00:28:45,302
when you have pneumonia,

489
00:28:45,302 --> 00:28:48,313
very often there is a chest X-ray
being performed just to determine

490
00:28:48,313 --> 00:28:51,954
to what extent
there is fluid accumulation in the lung,

491
00:28:51,954 --> 00:28:55,765
which you have to cough out
in the course of the disease.

492
00:28:56,835 --> 00:29:00,244
And the final example I want to show here
is the liver--this is an ultrasound.

493
00:29:00,244 --> 00:29:02,186
The liver is, of course, there's no bone

494
00:29:02,186 --> 00:29:05,837
impeding the image to deliver,
so ultrasound's a good technique,

495
00:29:05,837 --> 00:29:08,174
and there is also MRI here.

496
00:29:08,174 --> 00:29:11,786
This is a typical structure
of a liver lobe--

497
00:29:11,786 --> 00:29:14,465
this is the front of the belly,
here's the spine,

498
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:20,037
and there is some
hyperintensity in the liver,

499
00:29:20,037 --> 00:29:23,998
so that can also be used for MRI,

500
00:29:23,998 --> 00:29:27,857
and ultrasound is, of course,
much faster in this case.

501
00:29:27,857 --> 00:29:32,039
So I wanted to give you some examples
of different techniques,

502
00:29:32,039 --> 00:29:34,848
by example, by showing the images,

503
00:29:34,848 --> 00:29:41,100
to put ourselves in the context
of these image modalities

504
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,341
that we have seen in this course.

505
00:29:43,971 --> 00:29:46,821
And this concludes the entire course.

506
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:49,431
Thank you very much.
I hope you have enjoyed it.
