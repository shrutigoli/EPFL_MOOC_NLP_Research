1
00:00:04,243 --> 00:00:08,190
So, for the situation of a liquid sample,

2
00:00:09,220 --> 00:00:13,753
a fluid that's stationary,
the situation is fairly simple.

3
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:15,971
Now, in reality, in living tissue,

4
00:00:15,971 --> 00:00:18,658
we're confronted 
with a more complex situation,

5
00:00:18,658 --> 00:00:20,153
and that is we have cells,

6
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:21,910
we have membranes,

7
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:27,424
and so the water molecules 
cannot diffuse at their free will

8
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:31,436
in all directions as they wish
as they would in a beaker.

9
00:00:31,936 --> 00:00:33,593
So we're considering here two cases:

10
00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:35,739
one is an axon, so that's the nerve fiber

11
00:00:35,739 --> 00:00:37,548
that connects neurons in the brain;

12
00:00:37,548 --> 00:00:41,326
or muscle cells, muscle is myofibrils.

13
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:43,534
These are one-dimensional structures.

14
00:00:43,534 --> 00:00:45,417
Here's the example of myelin,

15
00:00:45,417 --> 00:00:46,855
so the axon is in here

16
00:00:46,855 --> 00:00:48,604
with the microtubules and neurofilaments,

17
00:00:48,604 --> 00:00:51,098
we have cell membrane, 
and then the myelin sheath

18
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:54,477
encasing the axon.

19
00:00:54,747 --> 00:00:56,136
So it's a one-dimensional structure,

20
00:00:56,136 --> 00:00:57,948
you can think of it as a tube,

21
00:00:59,648 --> 00:01:03,133
and we'll consider the membranes--
this is simplification--

22
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:05,838
but we'll consider them
for the sake of the argument--

23
00:01:05,838 --> 00:01:11,123
that they are impermeable
to the water molecules.

24
00:01:11,463 --> 00:01:14,089
In three-dimensions
this is what a bundle of nerves,

25
00:01:14,089 --> 00:01:16,030
or muscle cells, would look like.

26
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,219
They're one-dimensional,
for the nerve cells in the axons,

27
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:20,755
here is the myelin sheath,

28
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:22,969
they are lined up like this.

29
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:30,013
And now what we are going to consider
is the motion in the cells.

30
00:01:30,013 --> 00:01:33,392
And so we have inside the cell,
we have the molecule

31
00:01:33,392 --> 00:01:35,465
that is confined to the cell,

32
00:01:35,935 --> 00:01:37,304
and between the cells

33
00:01:37,304 --> 00:01:39,622
the molecule can move 
a little bit further.

34
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:43,789
So a molecule that is between the cells,

35
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:46,030
it can essentially move
in the extracellular space

36
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:47,975
from my right here, to my left here.

37
00:01:47,975 --> 00:01:51,105
If it's inside the cell, it's stuck 
to the volume of the cell.

38
00:01:52,205 --> 00:01:56,914
And the following experiment
visually demonstrates this with a colloid,

39
00:01:57,514 --> 00:01:59,619
the motion of particles,

40
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,850
and you'll see that some particles
can move more freely than others.

41
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:08,836
So what we see here 
is there's some particles

42
00:02:08,836 --> 00:02:11,197
that are fixed by the glass
in the microscope.

43
00:02:11,667 --> 00:02:14,976
They're colloids, but you see 
the smaller objects

44
00:02:14,976 --> 00:02:17,556
that are moving between them,
the smaller particles,

45
00:02:17,556 --> 00:02:21,347
and this is similar to the water molecules
that we have in the tissue.

46
00:02:21,347 --> 00:02:23,381
They're diffusing around 
in the free space,

47
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:25,441
but you can also see
that there are some molecules,

48
00:02:25,441 --> 00:02:28,186
or some of the smaller particles,

49
00:02:28,536 --> 00:02:30,856
they bump into the bigger ones
and they can't pass them.

50
00:02:30,856 --> 00:02:34,816
This is akin to the situation
that we have in living tissue

51
00:02:34,816 --> 00:02:37,945
where the water molecules
bump into cell membranes,

52
00:02:37,945 --> 00:02:39,959
and they have to go around the membranes,

53
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:42,349
or they're stuck within the cells.

54
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:46,670
So consequence is, if you look here,

55
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:49,185
in this is a cut 
perpendicular to the cells,

56
00:02:49,185 --> 00:02:52,081
the molecule here is inside the cell,

57
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:54,592
is stuck to the dimensions of the cell--

58
00:02:54,592 --> 00:02:56,453
this is typically a micron--

59
00:02:56,453 --> 00:02:59,200
extracellularly it can diffuse further,

60
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,936
although it has to diffuse 
around the cells.

61
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:07,545
If you now look at a cut along the axon,
here along the cell structure,

62
00:03:07,545 --> 00:03:09,590
now the distance is pretty much

63
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:12,674
much longer, and pretty much unrestricted.

64
00:03:13,154 --> 00:03:16,614
So consider the motion here,
and the motion here.

65
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:18,865
Here the mean displacement
can be much bigger

66
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:21,393
than the mean displacement is here.

67
00:03:22,777 --> 00:03:25,383
So with a restricted motion 
by cell membranes

68
00:03:25,383 --> 00:03:29,454
in one-dimensional structures
like we see often in nature--

69
00:03:29,454 --> 00:03:31,415
in the brain and in the muscle--

70
00:03:31,415 --> 00:03:34,054
the motion is restricted by membranes,

71
00:03:34,054 --> 00:03:37,545
and the membrane structure 
is not isotropic,

72
00:03:37,545 --> 00:03:40,086
the cell structure is not isotropic.

73
00:03:40,506 --> 00:03:43,246
So what does this mean?
We are getting, clearly here,

74
00:03:43,246 --> 00:03:46,116
this distance is much smaller
than this distance,

75
00:03:46,516 --> 00:03:49,174
we're getting an anisotropic 
mean displacement,

76
00:03:49,174 --> 00:03:50,707
and from Einstein's equation,

77
00:03:50,707 --> 00:03:54,615
we're getting an anisotropic 
diffusion coefficient.

78
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,598
So what does this mean?

79
00:03:56,598 --> 00:03:58,828
This means that depending

80
00:03:58,828 --> 00:04:01,330
whether I measure
in the direction of the axon,

81
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,178
or perpendicular, that is if I apply 
the gradient perpendicular--

82
00:04:04,178 --> 00:04:06,967
I mentioned the motion 
perpendicular to the axon--

83
00:04:06,967 --> 00:04:09,281
here the motion is restricted
to a small distance.

84
00:04:09,651 --> 00:04:11,891
If my gradient is along
the direction of the axon

85
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:13,047
in this direction,

86
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:15,366
the mean displacement is larger,

87
00:04:15,366 --> 00:04:17,914
and so depending 
what type of gradient I apply,

88
00:04:17,914 --> 00:04:21,499
I get a different apparent 
diffusion coefficient,

89
00:04:21,499 --> 00:04:24,227
and this is spatially anisotropic.

90
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:30,385
So consequently, the diffusion coefficient
that one measures,

91
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:34,463
the apparent diffusion coefficient,
depends on the gradient orientation.

92
00:04:35,503 --> 00:04:37,121
This is mathematically--

93
00:04:37,121 --> 00:04:41,641
a good approach
is to describe this mathematically

94
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:45,662
by a diffusion tensor <i>D_i_j.</i>

95
00:04:45,662 --> 00:04:49,395
What is this mathematically?
Well, basically, it's a 3 x 3 matrix,

96
00:04:50,395 --> 00:04:51,514
and here it is.

97
00:04:51,514 --> 00:04:55,446
So this is what describes
the diffusion process.

98
00:04:56,354 --> 00:04:58,434
Now let's look at some examples

99
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:00,465
to convince ourselves that this is real.

100
00:05:00,904 --> 00:05:02,665
So here's a diffusion-weighted image,

101
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:05,266
so we're looking at <i>just</i>
the diffusion weighting,

102
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:08,135
the gradient is applied along <i>z</i>.

103
00:05:08,505 --> 00:05:12,464
So this means it is going
perpendicular to the plane.

104
00:05:12,884 --> 00:05:18,238
Bright means very little diffusion,

105
00:05:18,238 --> 00:05:19,848
dark means a lot of diffusion.

106
00:05:19,848 --> 00:05:22,129
So here we have a lot of diffusion,

107
00:05:22,129 --> 00:05:23,501
here we have very little,

108
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:27,156
and here, in this area, 
we have <i>substantial</i> diffusion,

109
00:05:27,156 --> 00:05:28,858
the signal is strongly attenuated.

110
00:05:28,858 --> 00:05:32,059
So bright is less attenuation,
dark is a lot of attenuation.

111
00:05:32,514 --> 00:05:36,079
Now, the next image is the diffusion
in the <i>x</i> direction,

112
00:05:36,079 --> 00:05:37,649
so this is horizontal.

113
00:05:37,649 --> 00:05:40,597
And now, notice this area here.
I'll go back.

114
00:05:40,597 --> 00:05:42,326
Here, it's the same image,

115
00:05:42,326 --> 00:05:45,201
here we had not so much diffusion,

116
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:48,252
and here it gets essentially dark,
so there's a lot of diffusion.

117
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:50,689
And this is the area
of the corpus callosum.

118
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,226
The corpus callosum, if you think of it,

119
00:05:52,226 --> 00:05:53,971
that's the bus, that's the ribbon cable

120
00:05:53,971 --> 00:05:56,380
that connects the nerve fibers 
from the right hemisphere

121
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,274
and the left hemisphere.
It's like a ribbon bus.

122
00:05:58,274 --> 00:06:01,268
In this direction are the orientation
of all the axons,

123
00:06:01,268 --> 00:06:03,178
and they're very colinear aligned,

124
00:06:03,178 --> 00:06:07,067
so we have a lot of diffusion,
right-left in this direction.

125
00:06:07,067 --> 00:06:10,513
And that's why, if we apply the gradient
in right-left orientation,

126
00:06:10,913 --> 00:06:12,954
this signal is strongly attenuated.

127
00:06:12,954 --> 00:06:16,433
Here also, as you can see,
it's very much not attenuated,

128
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:19,343
so it's bright, and here it gets dark,
the same area.

129
00:06:19,343 --> 00:06:22,356
So also here we have 
right-left orientation

130
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:24,245
of the diffusion process.

131
00:06:26,005 --> 00:06:30,305
And, finally, we're looking
at the diffusion process

132
00:06:30,305 --> 00:06:33,035
from front to back, 
so from here to here,

133
00:06:33,035 --> 00:06:34,296
and now we can see, again,

134
00:06:34,296 --> 00:06:37,486
corpus callosum 
is regaining its intensity here,

135
00:06:37,486 --> 00:06:38,721
here again.

136
00:06:38,721 --> 00:06:42,796
And now we have these areas
that are losing intensity,

137
00:06:42,796 --> 00:06:44,094
here and here.

138
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:48,546
Can you guess what we're looking at there?

139
00:06:50,008 --> 00:06:51,759
So this is the back of the head,

140
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:54,277
here, is the back of the head,

141
00:06:54,607 --> 00:06:56,192
the eyes are in the front.

142
00:06:56,542 --> 00:06:59,705
Now, what we are looking at here
is the optic nerve,

143
00:06:59,705 --> 00:07:01,999
the connection from the eyeballs
to the back of the head,

144
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:03,089
the primary visual cortex

145
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:06,909
where the primary processing
of visual information occurs.

146
00:07:07,269 --> 00:07:09,531
So we're seeing that directionality here.

147
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:13,969
Notice that in all three images
this area is always dark.

148
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:17,389
That's the ventricles, 
it's filled with cerebrospinal fluid,

149
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:20,971
so it behaves like free water.
It's isotropic,

150
00:07:20,971 --> 00:07:25,851
and since there's no membrane restriction
for water in that space,

151
00:07:25,851 --> 00:07:30,885
it will have a much higher
diffusion coefficient in that area.

152
00:07:30,885 --> 00:07:35,582
And that's why it is seen dark
and isotropic in all three cases.

153
00:07:35,582 --> 00:07:41,074
So this is isotropic diffusion 
for the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF.

154
00:07:43,093 --> 00:07:45,342
Now, we have seen the diffusion tensor,

155
00:07:46,022 --> 00:07:49,054
and there's one property
that this diffusion tensor has:

156
00:07:49,054 --> 00:07:50,904
it's a symmetric tensor.

157
00:07:51,214 --> 00:07:56,749
Now, here we have to make use
of some things that you might remember

158
00:07:56,749 --> 00:07:58,724
from your linear algebra course--

159
00:07:58,724 --> 00:08:01,195
or then you have to accept it here--

160
00:08:01,195 --> 00:08:05,085
if you have a 3 x 3 matrix
that is symmetric,

161
00:08:05,085 --> 00:08:06,717
and so real numbers,

162
00:08:06,717 --> 00:08:11,886
then we can characterize it
with three orthogonal eigenvectors.

163
00:08:11,886 --> 00:08:16,927
And if we choose to describe
this diffusion tensor in a basis system

164
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:19,515
where <i>x</i> corresponds to one eigenvector,

165
00:08:19,515 --> 00:08:22,176
<i>y</i> to another one, and <i>z</i> to another one,

166
00:08:22,176 --> 00:08:26,568
then the mathematical description
of the diffusion

167
00:08:26,568 --> 00:08:30,718
is given by the eigenvalues.

168
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:35,067
So here, we have one eigenvector
in this direction,

169
00:08:35,067 --> 00:08:37,009
usually <i>λ_1</i> is the biggest one,

170
00:08:37,009 --> 00:08:41,229
and <i>λ_2</i> and <i>λ_3</i> 
are the two other eigenvectors.

171
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,519
And if we choose that 
as our coordinate system

172
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,659
for describing the coordinates,

173
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:50,259
then in this coordinate system
our diffusion tensor now becomes

174
00:08:50,259 --> 00:08:54,799
a diagonal matrix 
with these three diffusion processes

175
00:08:55,499 --> 00:08:57,983
describing the diffusion
along the first eigenvector,

176
00:08:57,983 --> 00:09:00,753
second eigenvector, and third eigenvector.

177
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:07,701
And so this is the experiment
that one can do,

178
00:09:07,701 --> 00:09:12,194
one can actually obtain
this diffusion tensor.

179
00:09:12,884 --> 00:09:15,288
One can obtain the mean diffusivity.

180
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:19,206
This is the trace of the tensor,
and that overall is actually

181
00:09:19,206 --> 00:09:22,474
a not very interesting information.

182
00:09:23,054 --> 00:09:25,752
We can see the cerebrospinal fluid,
but the rest of the image,

183
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:28,235
as you notice here, is pretty much gray,

184
00:09:28,235 --> 00:09:32,345
so there is not a huge difference

185
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:36,095
in mean diffusivity across the brain.

186
00:09:36,675 --> 00:09:40,387
Take now here, an example.
This is the fractional anisotropy--

187
00:09:40,387 --> 00:09:42,937
that's another parameter
which one can characterize--

188
00:09:43,447 --> 00:09:46,255
and typically we have the situation
for one-dimensional structures,

189
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:48,556
that <i>λ_2</i> and <i>λ_3</i> are small,

190
00:09:48,556 --> 00:09:52,807
they are corresponding 
to a small displacement,

191
00:09:52,807 --> 00:09:57,516
<i>λ_1</i> along the direction of the axon
is the big displacement.

192
00:09:57,516 --> 00:10:01,196
So if we look at the difference of this
to the other two,

193
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:03,550
this gives us the fractional anisotropy--

194
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,870
the two formulae are different,

195
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,439
but I don't want to go 
into the details here,

196
00:10:07,439 --> 00:10:08,970
I want to stick with the principal--

197
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,529
what this measures is the difference
between the biggest eigenvector

198
00:10:12,529 --> 00:10:15,069
and the other two,
the fractional anisotropy.

199
00:10:15,069 --> 00:10:19,562
And now we can see there's
a lot of spatial information here.

200
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:23,350
So it basically measures,
how much is this ellipsoid,

201
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:25,862
described by the three eigenvalues,

202
00:10:26,462 --> 00:10:30,950
how much this is cigar-shaped,
or it is round.

203
00:10:31,352 --> 00:10:35,003
So fractional anisotropy that is zero
means isotropic diffusion.

204
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:38,334
So zero is here, so we have 
isotropic diffusion.

205
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:42,256
We have also, largely
in the gray matter, isotropic diffusion.

206
00:10:42,256 --> 00:10:44,372
This is, however, a reflection of the fact

207
00:10:44,372 --> 00:10:48,725
that we no longer have 
an oriented structure in the gray matter.

208
00:10:48,725 --> 00:10:52,122
But now we can see corpus callosum,
like I mentioned, this is the bus,

209
00:10:52,962 --> 00:10:56,014
very ordered structure,
the fractional anisotropy is very high.

210
00:10:56,014 --> 00:10:59,005
Optic nerve here,
we've seen that example also.

211
00:10:59,315 --> 00:11:01,270
It's essentially
the white matter structures

212
00:11:01,270 --> 00:11:03,326
where we have the fractional anisotropy,

213
00:11:03,326 --> 00:11:05,535
and this is where the axons,

214
00:11:05,535 --> 00:11:08,926
the cabling between
the brain cells, occurs.

215
00:11:10,876 --> 00:11:17,107
Now, finally, therefore, in each voxel

216
00:11:17,107 --> 00:11:19,108
we can determine the diffusion tensor.

217
00:11:19,388 --> 00:11:21,652
Once we've determined
the diffusion tensor,

218
00:11:21,652 --> 00:11:26,278
we can determine in each voxel
the direction of the major eigenvector,

219
00:11:26,278 --> 00:11:31,989
so that is the direction
of the largest eigenvalue,

220
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:35,720
and then color the image
with pseudocolor intensity.

221
00:11:36,409 --> 00:11:38,641
So this gives us
pseudocolor directionality.

222
00:11:38,641 --> 00:11:41,739
Here's the image, we're going to now
look at a box cutout here.

223
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:46,259
And if you look now in this box here,
we can see for each of the voxels

224
00:11:46,259 --> 00:11:50,852
an ellipsoid describing the orientation
of the diffusion tensor is drawn.

225
00:11:50,852 --> 00:11:53,267
We have in red, left-right,

226
00:11:53,467 --> 00:11:57,780
we have in green, top-bottom,
and blue, front to back.

227
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,222
Actually, I'm sorry, this is
the other way around.

228
00:12:01,222 --> 00:12:05,428
In blue is top-bottom,
and in green is front to back.

229
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:09,263
Red is right to left,
and this is a generally accepted norm,

230
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,134
how this is pseudocolored.

231
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:13,496
So if one now takes this image here--

232
00:12:13,496 --> 00:12:15,964
so this diffusion tensor
image of a brain--

233
00:12:15,964 --> 00:12:19,774
and color codes onto directionality
of the principal eigenvector,

234
00:12:19,774 --> 00:12:21,643
we have here, of course, right-left,

235
00:12:21,643 --> 00:12:25,398
we have here, top-bottom,
as we've seen on the previous image,

236
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:26,658
here is right-left again,

237
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:31,835
and green is front to back
in this case.

238
00:12:31,835 --> 00:12:37,067
Actually, here it's different,
the blue is out of the screen.

239
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:42,297
This is an example of a rat brain,
so, again, color-coded.

240
00:12:42,987 --> 00:12:46,296
And we have here, now, the rat brain
has very little white matter.

241
00:12:46,296 --> 00:12:48,948
The white matter is essentially
this structure here,

242
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:53,536
and the rest is gray matter,
yet we can see directionality.

243
00:12:55,018 --> 00:12:59,308
Let's look at this, 
so red means right to left, here,

244
00:12:59,508 --> 00:13:01,571
and here we have top to bottom,

245
00:13:02,141 --> 00:13:05,223
but this is gray matter,
this structure here, that's cortex.

246
00:13:05,223 --> 00:13:08,229
So what does this mean?
In here it goes between red and blue,

247
00:13:08,229 --> 00:13:09,778
the color changes.

248
00:13:09,968 --> 00:13:11,930
This basically means
that the diffusion process

249
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,081
is perpendicular to the surface.

250
00:13:14,591 --> 00:13:17,100
There's a directionality
of the diffusion process

251
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:23,955
of the water diffusion in the cortex
in the gray matter of the rat

252
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:26,612
that is perpendicular to the surface.

253
00:13:26,612 --> 00:13:30,022
And this reflects some 
of the neuronal structures

254
00:13:30,022 --> 00:13:32,783
which are very laminar-columnar
in organization,

255
00:13:32,783 --> 00:13:35,981
so the cells are perpendicular
to the surface,

256
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,583
protruding through the cortical layers.

257
00:13:39,809 --> 00:13:44,704
And this directionality can be picked up
with diffusion imaging,

258
00:13:44,704 --> 00:13:46,854
and displayed as such.

259
00:13:48,532 --> 00:13:52,154
So I want to give you some examples

260
00:13:52,154 --> 00:13:55,523
of what has the neuroscience community
very much excited,

261
00:13:55,523 --> 00:14:02,437
and that is the ability
to quantify this anisotropy.

262
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:05,718
So, if one does an image
of the diffusion anisotropy,

263
00:14:05,718 --> 00:14:08,777
we have the ellipsoids 
in each voxel here-- that's a cutout--

264
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:11,647
the color-coded maps of the diffusivity,

265
00:14:12,499 --> 00:14:14,270
the direction anisotropy.

266
00:14:14,766 --> 00:14:18,540
And now what is being done
is determining each voxel

267
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,192
the principal direction of diffusion.

268
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:24,136
Then we do it for the next voxel,
which may be like this,

269
00:14:24,136 --> 00:14:25,458
and then the next voxel.

270
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:30,070
And we'll suppose that this diffusion
is provided by a bundle of nerves,

271
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:34,667
of axons, that go along the direction
of the principal eigenvector,

272
00:14:34,667 --> 00:14:37,849
the vector with the biggest eigenvalue.

273
00:14:37,849 --> 00:14:40,890
So in this case, we would get a connection

274
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,135
of the voxels in this direction.

275
00:14:44,485 --> 00:14:48,151
And this is then done to connect
the adjacent voxels,

276
00:14:48,151 --> 00:14:51,591
and one obtains with that,
spaghetti-like images.

277
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:53,731
So here is a cut from the brain,

278
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:55,612
so we're looking on the top of the brain,

279
00:14:55,942 --> 00:14:58,158
this is the left side,
this is the right side.

280
00:14:58,158 --> 00:14:59,802
And here we can see the corpus callosum,

281
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:01,802
the connection between right and left,

282
00:15:01,802 --> 00:15:05,644
and these are all the projections
of white matter into gray matter.

283
00:15:05,644 --> 00:15:07,842
And this is now a view from the top,

284
00:15:07,842 --> 00:15:11,134
again, we have the optic nerve going here,

285
00:15:11,474 --> 00:15:13,964
we have the corpus callosum 
being connected,

286
00:15:13,964 --> 00:15:16,833
and we have some other connections 
perpendicular.

287
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:21,205
So this gives us a spaghetti-like 
representation of the connections.

288
00:15:22,355 --> 00:15:24,863
One can establish with that
the fiber tracks,

289
00:15:24,863 --> 00:15:27,025
and, finally, one can ask the question,

290
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:30,284
"Which part of the brain
is connected to which part?"

291
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:33,856
This provides information on probability

292
00:15:33,856 --> 00:15:35,987
that if we take a brain region here

293
00:15:35,987 --> 00:15:38,327
and another brain region here,
what is the probability

294
00:15:38,327 --> 00:15:42,832
that there indeed exists a connection,
in terms of cabling,

295
00:15:42,832 --> 00:15:44,920
between these brain regions.

296
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,498
Thus leads to a whole brain structural
connection network,

297
00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:50,917
or also known as a <i>connectome.</i>

298
00:15:51,797 --> 00:15:55,189
So these are applications that have
neuroscience very excited.

299
00:15:55,189 --> 00:15:59,459
One gets inside in the individual subject
on which parts of the brain

300
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,060
are connected somehow,

301
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,288
how they are connected,

302
00:16:04,288 --> 00:16:05,684
and, in some diseases,

303
00:16:05,684 --> 00:16:12,510
how much these connectivities
are perturbed by the disease in question.
