1
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:08,798
Now, the question is how do we get
from absorption, that is, we are measuring

2
00:00:08,798 --> 00:00:11,305
a number of photons arriving
at a detector--

3
00:00:11,945 --> 00:00:12,945
<i>that</i> we can measure--

4
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:15,634
we can measure a number of photons 
that arrive in the tissues--

5
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:18,034
so, we can measure
what goes in and what comes out.

6
00:00:19,094 --> 00:00:21,931
But how do we construct an image
based on that?

7
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:24,924
And this is what we are going
to discuss now.

8
00:00:26,256 --> 00:00:30,868
So, let's say, we have a tissue, here,
with three different layers.

9
00:00:31,669 --> 00:00:35,481
A position <i>y_0</i> of the first layer,
and each layer, we'll say,

10
00:00:35,481 --> 00:00:37,546
has a thickness of <i>Δ y</i>.

11
00:00:37,546 --> 00:00:39,187
Doesn't matter what the thickness is.

12
00:00:39,187 --> 00:00:43,167
Centimeter, millimeter, micrometers--
doesn't matter--

13
00:00:43,167 --> 00:00:45,107
we'll just say 
this is a certain thickness,

14
00:00:45,107 --> 00:00:48,243
and we have three different tissues, here.

15
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:54,064
We have at a certain position <i>y</i>

16
00:00:54,064 --> 00:00:58,605
an intensity of number of photons, I(y),

17
00:00:58,605 --> 00:01:01,222
that impact this tissue layer, here.

18
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:04,371
And we'll assume that they are the same
for the entire thickness--

19
00:01:04,371 --> 00:01:07,135
that there's a certain number of photons
that comes in here.

20
00:01:08,856 --> 00:01:12,368
So, we have a certain beam intensity--
it is now the number of photons

21
00:01:12,368 --> 00:01:14,503
at a given position, <i>y_0</i>.

22
00:01:14,917 --> 00:01:20,909
And so, we can now calculate
what is the intensity at <i>y_0 + Δ y</i>.

23
00:01:21,506 --> 00:01:24,286
And this intensity is, obviously, given
by the same equation

24
00:01:24,286 --> 00:01:28,176
we have discussed earlier, last week.

25
00:01:28,616 --> 00:01:32,322
The intensity, at this position, here,
is given by the intensity

26
00:01:32,322 --> 00:01:36,483
of the photons at this position--
that's the incoming photon beam

27
00:01:36,833 --> 00:01:40,810
times <i>e</i> to the minus <i>μ</i>--
the linear attenuation coefficient,

28
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:43,773
at this position, times <i>Δ y</i>.

29
00:01:43,773 --> 00:01:46,211
Here, we're assuming that across <i>Δ y</i>

30
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:48,981
the linear attenuation coefficient
does not change.

31
00:01:48,981 --> 00:01:51,322
That's a fair assumption-- 
we can always choose <i>Δ y</i>

32
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:54,743
sufficiently small,
that this condition is fulfilled.

33
00:01:55,313 --> 00:02:00,034
Now, I'm interested in calculating
the intensity at this position, here.

34
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:04,280
We'll do that-- we'll apply this equation,
here, recursively,

35
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,982
to arrive at this expression.

36
00:02:08,581 --> 00:02:10,663
This is what we are going to do now.

37
00:02:11,603 --> 00:02:17,661
So, the intensity at <i>y_0 + 2 Δ y</i>
is given by the intensity at <i>y_0 + Δ y</i>--

38
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:20,544
it's the intensity of the photons 
that arrive at this layer, here,

39
00:02:20,544 --> 00:02:24,104
times e to the <i>- μ</i> at this position,

40
00:02:24,104 --> 00:02:28,936
so, that's <i>y_0 + Δ y</i> 
times the thickness, <i>Δ y</i>, here.

41
00:02:29,584 --> 00:02:32,463
So, that is just the same thing
for this layer.

42
00:02:32,463 --> 00:02:35,691
We have the incoming intensity--
corresponds to this one--

43
00:02:35,691 --> 00:02:39,282
we have the absorption, the reduction,
here, corresponds to this one.

44
00:02:39,282 --> 00:02:41,579
Notice here, that we're taking
the linear attenuation coefficient

45
00:02:41,579 --> 00:02:43,740
of this layer, now, obviously.

46
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:50,288
So we can now substitute this equation
into this equation.

47
00:02:50,288 --> 00:02:51,770
That's what we are doing here.

48
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:55,471
So, we have done this here--
now we have this expression, here.

49
00:02:56,581 --> 00:02:59,281
And so, we will write here,
that the position--

50
00:02:59,281 --> 00:03:01,700
the intensity at this interface here

51
00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:03,893
is given by the intensity of the photons

52
00:03:03,893 --> 00:03:07,690
at this layer, here, 
times this expression, here.

53
00:03:07,690 --> 00:03:11,325
So this is just taking these two terms,
and they are being summed here,

54
00:03:13,076 --> 00:03:14,106
up here.

55
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,648
Now, can you see what kind
of expression this leads us to?

56
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:26,368
Let's say, we will let <i>Δ_y</i> go to zero.

57
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:31,287
And instead of making <i>y_0 + 2 Δ y</i>,

58
00:03:31,287 --> 00:03:37,204
we are going to go for a summation
over many <i>Δ y</i>-s.

59
00:03:37,729 --> 00:03:38,779
So what are we getting?

60
00:03:38,789 --> 00:03:41,725
Instead of a summation here,
we have a summation over <i>2 Δ y</i>-s.

61
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:44,536
We can sum from the source 
to the detector

62
00:03:45,046 --> 00:03:47,597
of the linear attenuation coefficient
and along <i>y</i>.

63
00:03:48,137 --> 00:03:53,320
I'll put in here variable <i>y'</i>,
d <i>y'</i>-- it's minus this--

64
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,349
this is what this sum here is.

65
00:03:55,349 --> 00:04:00,469
So, the intensity-- detected intensity
is equal to the impacting intensity, here,

66
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:05,406
times this integral, here,
e to the minus this integral, here,

67
00:04:05,406 --> 00:04:10,505
that gives us the detected intensity.

68
00:04:12,147 --> 00:04:14,485
Now, let's consider 
a two-dimensional object.

69
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:16,883
Obviously, we're not interested
in a one-dimensional image.

70
00:04:16,883 --> 00:04:19,044
We're interested 
in two-dimensional objects.

71
00:04:19,044 --> 00:04:21,546
So, we have the same object, here--
we have <i>y_0</i>.

72
00:04:21,976 --> 00:04:26,593
We'll call this dimension, again, <i>y</i>,
and we'll call this dimension, here, <i>x</i>.

73
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:32,428
So the intensity observed
at a certain position x, here,

74
00:04:33,348 --> 00:04:37,485
is now given by the intensity impacting--

75
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,882
well, here we've assumed 
that all the photons

76
00:04:40,262 --> 00:04:43,369
have the same intensity--
that they all depend on x--

77
00:04:43,369 --> 00:04:45,399
so, that's a normalization, here.

78
00:04:45,399 --> 00:04:49,090
And then it's e to the minus
this integral, again.

79
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:50,868
So, same integral, 
but now, we've introduced

80
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:53,250
a variable x, here, to indicate

81
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:56,947
that we also could have 
a variability along x.

82
00:04:58,434 --> 00:05:01,876
Now, what does this function, here, mean?

83
00:05:03,096 --> 00:05:07,099
So, we will now introduce
a mathematical transform--

84
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,749
that's the Radon transform.

85
00:05:08,749 --> 00:05:13,529
And the Radon transform is defined
as the Radon transform g(x)

86
00:05:13,529 --> 00:05:15,048
of this function <i>μ</i>.

87
00:05:15,278 --> 00:05:19,240
This gives you an integral 
from infinity to minus infinity

88
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:24,182
of <i>μ ( x, y ') d y'</i>,
so, along one of those variables.

89
00:05:25,106 --> 00:05:28,256
That is the Radon transform.

90
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:30,665
Now, unlike the Fourier transform,

91
00:05:30,665 --> 00:05:33,502
which has many useful 
mathematical properties,

92
00:05:33,502 --> 00:05:37,072
there are not that many
easy mathematical properties

93
00:05:37,072 --> 00:05:38,864
for the Radon transform.

94
00:05:38,864 --> 00:05:41,803
But I will make the case here,
that the Radon transform--

95
00:05:41,803 --> 00:05:47,736
to know it, and to recognize it
in the image generation process

96
00:05:47,736 --> 00:05:52,530
is nonetheless useful 
because we can deduce

97
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:55,039
some consequences from it.

98
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,764
So, what is the Radon transform
of a point like homogeneous objects?

99
00:05:59,764 --> 00:06:01,162
So, here's my object.

100
00:06:01,872 --> 00:06:03,873
We'll look at the Radon transform here.

101
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:07,403
This basically means we're integrating--
we have all the intensity

102
00:06:07,403 --> 00:06:11,859
at where the object is--
we're getting this intensity, here.

103
00:06:12,546 --> 00:06:15,890
If we take a rectangular object,
then the Radon transform

104
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:20,755
means, simply, we are integrating
along this direction here.

105
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:22,454
So, that's this integral, here.

106
00:06:22,454 --> 00:06:26,191
We're getting more intensity
with this thicker and only along <i>x</i>

107
00:06:26,511 --> 00:06:29,372
where there is dimension of the object.

108
00:06:30,551 --> 00:06:34,070
So, a Radon transform is, essentially,
a projection of the object--

109
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,783
a summed projection of the object
onto one of our axis here

110
00:06:38,783 --> 00:06:40,604
on the <i>x</i> axis.

111
00:06:42,644 --> 00:06:47,282
Let's look at the Radon transform
of a circular object.

112
00:06:47,803 --> 00:06:49,373
Here's a circular object.

113
00:06:49,913 --> 00:06:54,653
The Radon object or transform is here--
this is the integral, as we have seen.

114
00:06:54,653 --> 00:06:58,322
And it's actually a projection 
of the object onto an axis.

115
00:06:59,123 --> 00:07:03,144
And the question is, if we take
a two-dimensional object,

116
00:07:03,724 --> 00:07:07,323
does each pixel in that object,
does each picture element,

117
00:07:07,323 --> 00:07:13,270
each tiny element of the image,
have a unique representation

118
00:07:13,650 --> 00:07:15,987
as we generate the data set.

119
00:07:17,263 --> 00:07:20,168
And we're going to look here
at the detector.

120
00:07:20,758 --> 00:07:22,348
Here is a detector.

121
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:24,838
Here's our object--
it's got three holes in it.

122
00:07:25,858 --> 00:07:27,180
Here's the detector.

123
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:30,614
And we're going to move this detector
around the object.

124
00:07:30,994 --> 00:07:33,451
And this is what we have seen 
in the first video

125
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:34,931
of this week's lectures.

126
00:07:35,341 --> 00:07:38,096
We've seen that there's something
rotating inside the scanner.

127
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:41,329
And this is the detector 
that's being rotated around the subject.

128
00:07:41,329 --> 00:07:45,487
This rotation-- the question now
is if we do this rotation,

129
00:07:45,487 --> 00:07:49,403
or we record for each angle
a different Radon transform

130
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:51,530
where there is a different projection--

131
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:56,762
are we generating information
that allows us to uniquely identify

132
00:07:56,762 --> 00:07:58,728
each pixel in the image?

133
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:02,798
If we can say yes to that question,
then we can reconstruct an image.

134
00:08:03,891 --> 00:08:08,311
And so, what we are looking at, here,
now, is the angle <i>Φ</i>,

135
00:08:08,311 --> 00:08:13,861
which is the angle of the detector plate,
here, with respect to its rotation--

136
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:17,142
so, we're going to rotate it, that is,
we're going to change <i>Φ</i>.

137
00:08:17,142 --> 00:08:18,970
This is on this axis here.

138
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,221
And we are going to look
at our three holes.

139
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:26,948
Here are, for convenience, 
I have color coded them

140
00:08:26,948 --> 00:08:27,987
with different colors.

141
00:08:27,987 --> 00:08:31,244
The small hole is the red one,
the medium hole is the blue one,

142
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:33,201
and the big hole is the green one.

143
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:37,416
And we are going to look what happens
as we move the projection around.

144
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:40,090
We start in this projection, here.

145
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:43,660
The green and the blue are very close
on top of each other.

146
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:48,544
So, they are, in this projection,
they are very close to each other

147
00:08:48,544 --> 00:08:50,289
when they are being projected.

148
00:08:50,289 --> 00:08:52,997
Whereas, the red one 
is fairly to the side.

149
00:08:53,757 --> 00:08:58,415
And so, as I rotate the plate around,

150
00:08:58,415 --> 00:09:00,404
this object is stationary.

151
00:09:00,404 --> 00:09:05,533
As we rotate around,
and for each angle, we write down

152
00:09:05,533 --> 00:09:08,527
the projection-- we see that the position
of the holes changes.

153
00:09:10,827 --> 00:09:13,685
So, this is depending on their position.

154
00:09:13,685 --> 00:09:19,003
Here, we obviously have an angle, <i>Φ</i>,
where the green is at the edge.

155
00:09:19,003 --> 00:09:21,176
This would be this angle here.

156
00:09:21,176 --> 00:09:23,210
And the blue is almost on the other side.

157
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,750
How far away they are from the center

158
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:28,476
depends on all about 
which point we rotate.

159
00:09:28,476 --> 00:09:32,773
And this defines the extent 
the lateralization of our object.

160
00:09:32,773 --> 00:09:36,953
This object is pretty much in the middle
when we have this orientation,

161
00:09:36,953 --> 00:09:39,640
so at this point, it should be 
around here.

162
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,358
So, let's verify that.

163
00:09:41,358 --> 00:09:43,864
As we are at the extreme cases
for blue and yellow,

164
00:09:43,864 --> 00:09:45,879
red is just in the middle.

165
00:09:45,879 --> 00:09:50,290
So, as we are doing a rotation
of zero to 180 degrees,

166
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,599
we are seeing that the objects move
in a sinusoidal pattern.

167
00:09:54,599 --> 00:09:58,552
And we can actually verify
if we take just a pointwise object--

168
00:09:58,552 --> 00:10:03,972
that the trajectory of our point,
and here, these three points,

169
00:10:03,972 --> 00:10:06,632
we can write in this form--
it's given by a <i>R</i>--

170
00:10:06,632 --> 00:10:11,284
that's the maximum amplitude--
times <i>sin(Φ + Φ 0)</i>.

171
00:10:11,284 --> 00:10:16,428
<i>Φ 0</i> is an offset that's characteristic
for each of the points.

172
00:10:18,805 --> 00:10:22,855
Now, you can think about it
that each point in my image

173
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:25,725
is represented by a max different R.

174
00:10:25,945 --> 00:10:29,320
If they have the same <i>R</i>, 
then they will be differentiated by

175
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,224
at which angle they have the maximum,
that is where sin becomes maximal.

176
00:10:34,224 --> 00:10:38,866
Τhat depends on when we are perpendicular
to the position of that voxel.

177
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:41,490
So, this voxel has a maximum
if the projection is here.

178
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,415
The red one has a maximum
pretty much at this orientation.

179
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:50,055
So, the conclusion here
is that each point in space

180
00:10:50,055 --> 00:10:54,343
is uniquely represented by the amplitude
and the phase, Φ 0,

181
00:10:54,343 --> 00:10:58,194
of a sinusoidal trajectory 
in this plot here--

182
00:10:58,194 --> 00:11:00,285
and this plot is called a sinogram.

183
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:04,708
So, nomen est omen, 
it is a sinusoidal function,

184
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,288
so this depiction, here,

185
00:11:07,288 --> 00:11:09,153
is called a sinogram.

186
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:13,493
So, a position, a pixel 
in position <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>

187
00:11:13,493 --> 00:11:19,006
can be represented by a unique coordinate
in <i>R</i> and <i>Φ_0</i>.

188
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,474
So, the good news is we have independence
of each pixel in the image.

189
00:11:26,934 --> 00:11:28,802
They are uniquely represented.

190
00:11:28,802 --> 00:11:32,427
Another question is: what if we do
the simple matrix inversion?

191
00:11:34,239 --> 00:11:40,020
Let's take an object that we have
decomposed into a 2 by 2 matrix.

192
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:44,240
It's not very meaningful practically,
but we can assume that we are--

193
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,796
we can do that.

194
00:11:45,796 --> 00:11:49,158
And so we have four linear attenuation
coefficients to consider.

195
00:11:49,158 --> 00:11:52,129
We have four intensities,
we have measured four projections,

196
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:53,621
to here, to here.

197
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:56,048
And so, with these four measurements,

198
00:11:56,048 --> 00:11:58,848
since we have 
four linear attenuations to consider,

199
00:11:58,848 --> 00:12:01,987
we can calculate the intensity <i>I_1</i>,

200
00:12:01,987 --> 00:12:07,615
we can calculate 
the intensity I_2, I_3, I_4,

201
00:12:07,885 --> 00:12:11,107
so, we can do the logarithm of that, 
and then we obtain--

202
00:12:11,107 --> 00:12:12,505
what do we obtain, here?

203
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:16,954
We obtain a set of four linear equations,
with four unknowns.

204
00:12:17,524 --> 00:12:23,735
If we set <i>Δ y = Δ x</i>,
then we have a 2 by 2 inversion problem

205
00:12:23,735 --> 00:12:29,512
that links the <i>μ_k</i> to <i>I_k</i>,
so, we have four unknowns,

206
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:32,603
four equations-- that is something 
we can even imagine doing

207
00:12:32,603 --> 00:12:34,293
with paper and pencil.

208
00:12:34,563 --> 00:12:37,216
So, we get from the intensities--
we can get

209
00:12:37,216 --> 00:12:40,304
to the linear attenuation coefficients.

210
00:12:41,398 --> 00:12:46,732
Now, let's say we have a <i>n</i> by <i>n</i> matrix--
so, if we have an <i>n</i> squared matrix,

211
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:50,246
say 128 pixels that we want 
to have in our image,

212
00:12:50,246 --> 00:12:55,906
so, it's 128 by 128 
linear attenuation coefficients,

213
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:59,056
and, in principle, such a problem 
can also be inverted--

214
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:01,323
such a matrix can be inverted.

215
00:13:01,857 --> 00:13:04,109
The problem is this is very complex.

216
00:13:04,109 --> 00:13:08,831
It is computationally intensive
and also, on top of that,

217
00:13:08,831 --> 00:13:13,070
the matrix is-- inversion problem 
is unstable.

218
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:18,216
On top of this, we have to consider,
nowadays, that computed tomography

219
00:13:18,216 --> 00:13:20,919
was introduced in 1970.

220
00:13:22,457 --> 00:13:27,597
So, we have to be a bit more simpler
in the mathematical tools

221
00:13:27,597 --> 00:13:31,055
that are being used.

222
00:13:31,055 --> 00:13:34,646
We need a simple reconstruction algorithm.
