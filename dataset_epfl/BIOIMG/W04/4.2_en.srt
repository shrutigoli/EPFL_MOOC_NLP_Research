1
00:00:04,391 --> 00:00:10,997
We have seen that the size of the object
has an impact on contrast.

2
00:00:10,997 --> 00:00:16,187
There's a second consequence,
and that is the impact of scattering

3
00:00:16,187 --> 00:00:18,325
on contrast to noise ratio.

4
00:00:18,325 --> 00:00:21,943
And I want to address this question--
how does x-ray scattering impact

5
00:00:21,943 --> 00:00:24,062
the contrast to noise ratio.

6
00:00:25,212 --> 00:00:27,500
Let's look here at an idealized situation.

7
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:30,449
We have an x-ray situated-- x-ray source.

8
00:00:30,449 --> 00:00:34,499
And for simplicity, assume that we do
for the entire course, that the x-rays

9
00:00:34,499 --> 00:00:37,669
are coming in in a collinear,
coplanar way.

10
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:41,833
We have the subject here, 
and the subject here has a lesion.

11
00:00:43,223 --> 00:00:45,295
This is the lesion here.

12
00:00:45,977 --> 00:00:48,857
And now we will assume that this lesion

13
00:00:48,857 --> 00:00:52,307
is such that it is producing

14
00:00:52,307 --> 00:00:56,879
complete absorption of the photons,
through the photoelectric effect,

15
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,996
and this complete absorption, obviously,
means that the object, the lesion,

16
00:01:01,996 --> 00:01:03,779
is easily detected.

17
00:01:06,039 --> 00:01:10,730
Now, let's consider the situation
where we increase the photon energy.

18
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,574
As we increase the photon energy,
as we have seen, Compton scattering

19
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:18,238
becomes increasingly predominant,
and this produces

20
00:01:18,238 --> 00:01:20,988
an increased masking 
of the object, as follows.

21
00:01:21,618 --> 00:01:26,211
We have the film that we detect,
here-- here's the idealized object, here.

22
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,696
You see it very clearly, here.

23
00:01:27,696 --> 00:01:30,664
But now, we can have photons
that are being scattered

24
00:01:30,664 --> 00:01:35,669
by the Compton effect,
that are detected at this location,

25
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:38,380
even though they have come
this path here,

26
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,646
and then they are coming through here.

27
00:01:41,076 --> 00:01:44,899
As we increase the photon energy
even further, Compton starts

28
00:01:44,899 --> 00:01:50,640
to completely dominate the mechanism
of x-ray interaction with tissue.

29
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,815
We have increased Compton events,
and this leads to a near complete masking

30
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:57,573
of the object.

31
00:02:00,274 --> 00:02:04,224
So, this scattering, the probability
of this scattering, obviously,

32
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:08,522
increases with field of view, 
as the object is bigger--

33
00:02:08,522 --> 00:02:11,032
so we can have a photon scattered here

34
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:15,593
at the lower abdomen,
and up here at the level of the heart,

35
00:02:15,593 --> 00:02:17,472
because it has been scattered.

36
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,282
So, with a larger field of view
of a radiation,

37
00:02:20,282 --> 00:02:24,591
we have an increased reduction
of image contrast.

38
00:02:25,371 --> 00:02:30,331
And the solution here is to mitigate
the effects of scattering

39
00:02:30,331 --> 00:02:34,080
by using an anti-scatter grid,
which is actually the same thing

40
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:38,422
as a collimator, and collimators
are something we are going to talk about

41
00:02:38,422 --> 00:02:42,871
next week, when we talk about emission
computed tomography.

42
00:02:44,382 --> 00:02:47,768
So, let's look at schematically,
what this anti-scatter grid

43
00:02:47,768 --> 00:02:49,460
or collimator is doing.

44
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:52,682
We'll presume we have a detector,
here, at the bottom.

45
00:02:53,502 --> 00:02:58,984
And then we have two thin stripes--
in this case we'll idealize it.

46
00:02:58,984 --> 00:03:02,893
This is not the complete situation,
but doing it idealized the principle--

47
00:03:02,893 --> 00:03:07,966
this is a material that has a very high
atomic number set,

48
00:03:07,966 --> 00:03:09,754
and a high electron density.

49
00:03:09,754 --> 00:03:13,071
We can idealize it, 
it's not a perfect situation,

50
00:03:13,071 --> 00:03:18,386
but this a material 
that is capable of stopping the x-rays.

51
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:22,417
So, the x-rays are coming
nearly collinear,

52
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:24,752
as we would like to have it, here.

53
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:29,543
They come in, they're still passing
in the detected-- by the detector.

54
00:03:29,919 --> 00:03:34,311
For x-rays that are being scattered
by Compton, that is these x-rays here,

55
00:03:34,311 --> 00:03:37,127
here, and here-- 
they don't have the proper angle--

56
00:03:37,327 --> 00:03:39,869
so, they are not coming 
in a collinear fashion.

57
00:03:39,869 --> 00:03:43,951
They hit this collimator material, here,
and they are being stopped,

58
00:03:43,951 --> 00:03:48,186
so they cannot penetrate,
and so they are being eliminated.

59
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:53,220
In the real world, the collimator grid
looks like this image here.

60
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,788
So, it's a hexagonal structure,
has a certain thickness,

61
00:03:58,788 --> 00:04:03,831
and this does ensure a certain
directionality of the x-rays.

62
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:09,110
This collimation principle
is brute force way of establishing

63
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,729
directionality of the x-rays.

64
00:04:10,729 --> 00:04:14,080
If there's a way we could detect 
the x-rays--not only just the x-ray,

65
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,357
but also say, well, it came 
in this direction, or that direction,

66
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:21,384
this would be the perfect experiment
to do--we wouldn't need it--

67
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:25,721
but this is not very easy to do,
so this is a brute force way

68
00:04:25,721 --> 00:04:30,220
of establishing the directionality
of x-rays, by elimination of those x-rays

69
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:33,935
that do not fulfill 
the geometric requirements

70
00:04:33,935 --> 00:04:36,655
of the detection.

71
00:04:37,105 --> 00:04:39,745
And here, I want to illustrate
this principle,

72
00:04:39,745 --> 00:04:41,578
so if we establish collimation,

73
00:04:41,578 --> 00:04:44,016
we can use this to select a slice.

74
00:04:44,016 --> 00:04:47,737
And this is the only time
I'm going to talk for the x-ray techniques

75
00:04:47,737 --> 00:04:49,500
about slice selection.

76
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:54,054
So we're basically--the collimation 
establishes that only x-rays

77
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:57,710
that are coming in a certain direction,
or nearly that direction,

78
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,508
are passing through the detector.

79
00:04:59,508 --> 00:05:01,578
And the way we can see it
is that we actually

80
00:05:01,578 --> 00:05:05,605
are taking this [spread], that's our body,
and, virtually, with this instrument,

81
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,447
we're cutting it into slices.

82
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:09,983
That's slice selection
as it is being done.

83
00:05:09,983 --> 00:05:11,996
Obviously, we're not cutting
the live subject--

84
00:05:11,996 --> 00:05:16,416
that would not be very practical
and admissible.

85
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:18,337
It's done by the instrument.

86
00:05:18,337 --> 00:05:22,822
So, it's a virtual slice selection--
here, this is real, by cutting the slices

87
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,991
with a knife, but we're doing it
with collimation--

88
00:05:25,991 --> 00:05:30,337
we're ensuring that only what is between
these two cutting holes

89
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:33,048
is being passed through the detector.

90
00:05:35,064 --> 00:05:39,805
And, so, here in this short video,
we are seeing the detection

91
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:42,335
of a CT scan.

92
00:05:42,671 --> 00:05:47,723
We're seeing the detector rotate
with the source.

93
00:05:47,723 --> 00:05:52,008
This is what we'll discuss later
this week, on how the images

94
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:53,338
are being produced.

95
00:05:53,338 --> 00:05:59,660
And as you can see, as the video moves on,
you are seeing, now, how the subject

96
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,455
is being moved through the scanner.

97
00:06:01,455 --> 00:06:05,583
So, actually, here, the slice selection 
is being done through the collimation.

98
00:06:05,583 --> 00:06:07,243
We're selecting a slice.

99
00:06:07,243 --> 00:06:10,431
But instead of having multiple slices
that we can select,

100
00:06:10,431 --> 00:06:14,146
we are physically moving the patient bed
through the scanner,

101
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:17,844
and this generates all these images
that are then appearing

102
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:22,360
in the video one by one.

103
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,554
So this is a way to generate 
a slice selective information.

104
00:06:30,055 --> 00:06:35,851
Now, we will talk about the quantification
of contrast to noise ratio.

105
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:38,207
How is this, now, quantified?

106
00:06:38,527 --> 00:06:41,660
The signal is proportional
to the intensity as a function

107
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:42,620
of a distance.

108
00:06:42,631 --> 00:06:46,214
So, it is proportional the number 
of photons detected.

109
00:06:46,214 --> 00:06:48,772
It is, therefore, also proportional
to the number of photons

110
00:06:48,772 --> 00:06:51,687
with which we irradiate the subject.

111
00:06:53,516 --> 00:06:57,273
And so, the contrast that we get
is actually a contrast--

112
00:06:57,273 --> 00:07:00,943
a change in the photon numbers,
<i>Δ I</i>, as a function of distance

113
00:07:00,943 --> 00:07:05,207
due to differences in the linear
attenuation coefficient.

114
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:14,715
We have a distribution of the energies--
energy spectrum, <i>i(E_ν)</i>.

115
00:07:14,715 --> 00:07:20,111
So, the Compton effect, <i>μ_ C</i>,
produces reduced contrast.

116
00:07:21,059 --> 00:07:23,234
And we have Compton scattering.

117
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:26,663
So, this is dealt with
with the anti-scatter grid.

118
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:30,529
So, let's assume we have all this solved.

119
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:36,151
The scattering is eliminated,

120
00:07:36,151 --> 00:07:40,571
and we have a way to quantify.

121
00:07:40,571 --> 00:07:44,483
Now, the thing is, here, what I want
to point out is we have the intensity,

122
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:47,846
the <i>I_0</i>, we have--

123
00:07:47,846 --> 00:07:50,876
the link here
is the linear attenuation coefficient.

124
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:56,280
And so, since we can measure
the relative--

125
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,713
the <i>I(d)</i> as a function of <i>I_0</i>, 
we can have an absolute measure

126
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,613
of the absorption of the CTs.

127
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:06,462
And this is something where CT,
for example, is different form MRI.

128
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:10,515
We have an absolute measure
of the CT intensity,

129
00:08:10,515 --> 00:08:15,490
which gives rise to the term CT-number.

130
00:08:17,329 --> 00:08:22,238
In soft tissue, we typically have
weak contrast, and so this is quantified

131
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:26,591
in Hounsfield units, and they are small
Hounsfield units.

132
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:32,826
And so, we look here at the CT-numbers
in terms of Hounsfield units.

133
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:35,897
Now, a CT-number is the linear
attenuation coefficient

134
00:08:35,897 --> 00:08:37,697
of the tissue in question,

135
00:08:37,697 --> 00:08:40,390
minus the linear 
attenuation coefficient of water

136
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,687
divided by the linear
attenuation coefficient of water,

137
00:08:44,687 --> 00:08:48,958
and then, the whole thing multiplied
by a thousand.

138
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,169
What does this mean?

139
00:08:50,169 --> 00:08:53,686
This means we're looking at the deviation
of the linear attenuation coefficient

140
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:55,572
from that of water.

141
00:08:56,352 --> 00:09:01,856
So, this would be a dimensionless unit,
which gives us the relative deviation,

142
00:09:01,856 --> 00:09:04,533
and this is multiplied by a thousand.

143
00:09:05,856 --> 00:09:08,192
So, it is normalized to water
by definition.

144
00:09:08,192 --> 00:09:11,733
If <i>μ</i>, here, is that of water,
this is the CT-number is zero.

145
00:09:11,733 --> 00:09:14,561
And we have a range from minus 1,000

146
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:18,091
for air, to plus, 3,000 for bone

147
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,823
and contrast agents.

148
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:22,775
Air is at a minus 1,000--
well, air has, essentially,

149
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:25,843
no linear attenuation coefficient--
there are no electrons in air,

150
00:09:26,243 --> 00:09:28,760
or very few; the density is very low.

151
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:33,397
So, we are getting minus <i>μ_water</i>,
divided by <i>μ_water</i>,

152
00:09:33,397 --> 00:09:36,382
that's minus 1, times a thousand,
is minus 1,000.

153
00:09:36,382 --> 00:09:39,167
This is where we have the air,
down here.

154
00:09:40,142 --> 00:09:43,865
And we have the bone, here--
this has a high electron density,

155
00:09:43,865 --> 00:09:47,937
so we have up to plus 3,000.

156
00:09:47,937 --> 00:09:49,315
So, what does 3,000 mean?

157
00:09:49,315 --> 00:09:54,292
3,000 means that the linear attenuation
coefficient of bone is 4 times

158
00:09:54,292 --> 00:09:55,896
that of water.

159
00:09:56,526 --> 00:09:59,886
4 minus 1, divided by 1-- that gives us 3,

160
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:02,866
times a thousand, gives us 3,000.

161
00:10:03,616 --> 00:10:05,305
Now, look at all the other tissues.

162
00:10:05,305 --> 00:10:07,626
And note here, the break
in the vertical scale.

163
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,704
We're looking at Hounsfield units, here,
on the range of, essentially,

164
00:10:12,704 --> 00:10:17,300
from 20 to 60.

165
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,415
So, these are very small deviations
from the linear attenuation coefficient

166
00:10:22,415 --> 00:10:23,379
of water.

167
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:27,532
They are, obviously, primarily water,
so water does dominate

168
00:10:27,532 --> 00:10:31,564
our contrast.

169
00:10:31,585 --> 00:10:35,590
We have breasts, we have fat--
there's a lot of fat in breasts--

170
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:39,722
and we have the lung, here--
which is air,

171
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:41,667
so it's getting close to air.

172
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:44,676
So, we have weak Hounsfield units,

173
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:48,174
that means we have 
not excellent soft tissue contrast.

174
00:10:48,984 --> 00:10:53,482
The main contrast mechanisms are air,
tissue, and bone tissue--

175
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:58,079
those are the strong contrast
that we see in CT images.

176
00:10:59,008 --> 00:11:02,874
So, we're looking at a range 
of minus 300 to plus 100

177
00:11:02,874 --> 00:11:04,705
for soft tissue.
