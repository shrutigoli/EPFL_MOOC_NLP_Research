1
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:09,486
Last week, we talked about how x-rays--
the mechanism by which the x-rays

2
00:00:09,486 --> 00:00:12,474
are being absorbed in the tissue
when we have established

3
00:00:12,474 --> 00:00:15,883
that absorption of x-rays
is the major contrast in x-ray imaging.

4
00:00:16,223 --> 00:00:19,560
So, this week, we're going to talk
about how we generate images

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,697
from this absorption data

6
00:00:23,437 --> 00:00:25,467
in the real world.

7
00:00:25,647 --> 00:00:31,330
We'll first talk about some complications
that arise in the real world,

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:34,318
and then we'll talk
about the reconstruction algorithm

9
00:00:34,318 --> 00:00:37,801
that is needed in the second half
of this week's lectures.

10
00:00:38,101 --> 00:00:41,602
But first, I'd want to start out
with the underlying technique,

11
00:00:41,602 --> 00:00:44,261
showing some examples--
this is computed tomography

12
00:00:44,261 --> 00:00:45,751
that we're talking about.

13
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:48,201
It was invented in the early '70s.

14
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:52,752
And what we're looking at here
is an example of the use

15
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:57,893
of computed tomography--
we have a CT scan here

16
00:00:59,153 --> 00:01:00,623
of the abdomen.

17
00:01:00,623 --> 00:01:03,366
We see a lesion here, before therapy
and after therapy--

18
00:01:03,366 --> 00:01:05,736
how the lesion has disappeared.

19
00:01:08,123 --> 00:01:12,054
Now, here's an example of a CT--
early one, 1972--

20
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:16,367
and you can appreciate the difference
in quality of the images

21
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:19,272
compared to contemporary CT
with this early one.

22
00:01:19,272 --> 00:01:22,458
One has to really put an arrow
to highlight the lesion here--

23
00:01:22,458 --> 00:01:27,309
this is a cranial CT, that of a head,
and the lesion-- it's really not apparent

24
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,269
what generated that lesion.

25
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:37,714
CT was developed by Godfrey Hounsfield--
he developed the mathematical algorithm,

26
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:43,357
an engineer, and Allan Cormack,
a physicist, he is shown here--

27
00:01:43,357 --> 00:01:47,857
and they received the Nobel Prize
for physiology and medicine.

28
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:52,931
This is what a CT scanner looks like--
I wanted to show it to you

29
00:01:52,931 --> 00:01:55,546
so that we have an idea 
what we are talking about.

30
00:01:55,546 --> 00:01:59,326
This is the scanner-- 
is in this enclosure, here--

31
00:01:59,326 --> 00:02:02,432
this is the patient bed--
you would lie on this patient bed,

32
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:07,172
it would be lifted, and then entered
into this hole here

33
00:02:07,172 --> 00:02:10,574
where the scanning is taking place.

34
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:13,415
Here would be the head, the head
would be inserted in here.

35
00:02:13,415 --> 00:02:18,228
And of course, we don't want to show
to the patients all the technical insides,

36
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:23,201
so, there's a nice cover covering up
the machinery that's behind it.

37
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:26,561
And now, we're looking here
in this video--

38
00:02:26,561 --> 00:02:29,989
we're looking actually
at what's in the machinery.

39
00:02:30,645 --> 00:02:33,545
As you can see, there's something 
turning inside--

40
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:36,943
what we're looking at here is the inside--
that is this cover here is lifted,

41
00:02:36,943 --> 00:02:39,571
you see the cover is up here,
and now you see this turning,

42
00:02:39,571 --> 00:02:44,256
and quite an amazing noise 
as the machinery, the scanner

43
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:48,722
is being turned for producing the scan.

44
00:02:49,412 --> 00:02:53,601
So, this is obviously what we don't want
the patient neither to hear nor to see--

45
00:02:53,601 --> 00:02:57,093
this would be intimidating and people
would have much more trouble

46
00:02:57,093 --> 00:02:59,903
complying with the requirements
of the scan.

47
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:05,163
In the lectures of this week, 
we will discuss the reason behind

48
00:03:05,163 --> 00:03:10,353
why this machine is turning,
how this is used for generating images.

49
00:03:11,382 --> 00:03:14,033
CT is not only used for human patients.

50
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:16,973
It's also used in research 
for animal models.

51
00:03:17,223 --> 00:03:20,023
Here, I wanted to give you some examples.

52
00:03:20,343 --> 00:03:23,059
We'll first talk about the scanner itself.

53
00:03:23,059 --> 00:03:26,846
You can see this is how the scan--
here's the enclosure of the scanner.

54
00:03:26,846 --> 00:03:31,359
Here's the person, here's the opening--
this volunteer, here, would be

55
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:34,214
on the patient bed, here, and inserted
into the scanner.

56
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:36,594
Clearly, the opening here is not adequate

57
00:03:36,594 --> 00:03:41,264
for the subject--for the rodent--

58
00:03:41,834 --> 00:03:44,872
so the scanner has been adapted
for the smaller geometry--

59
00:03:44,872 --> 00:03:49,392
we're taking advantage
of having a closer proximity

60
00:03:49,392 --> 00:03:51,993
of the detectors to the subject.

61
00:03:53,272 --> 00:03:57,144
Now, here are some MicroCT examples,
some images.

62
00:03:57,144 --> 00:04:01,012
And MicroCT means really, CT
with high spatial resolution--

63
00:04:01,012 --> 00:04:05,989
we're talking, typically, here,
of 50 microns spatial resolution--

64
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:07,731
in-plane resolution.

65
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,031
The first image is of the abdomen.

66
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:14,448
We can see here the abdomen,
we see some lesions here,

67
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:18,259
we have the heart here,
and some other organs.

68
00:04:18,709 --> 00:04:21,767
This is a MicroCT of the rat's spine.

69
00:04:21,767 --> 00:04:23,526
We see the spinal cord here,

70
00:04:23,526 --> 00:04:27,126
and the disks surrounding it.

71
00:04:27,906 --> 00:04:31,318
This is an example of kidneys
with IV contrast.

72
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:37,584
We have the CT scan,
and then we can see

73
00:04:37,584 --> 00:04:40,299
the vessels very bright--
they have contrast agents in them--

74
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:42,879
that's what we have discussed last week.

75
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:46,260
We can see the contrast 
enhances the kidneys.

76
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:49,989
So, this is intravenous contrast 
that highlights the blood flow

77
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:51,671
in the kidneys.

78
00:04:52,391 --> 00:04:55,229
This example, here, is of the heart
and lungs.

79
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:59,202
We have the lungs here in dark, obviously,
they have low CT numbers.

80
00:04:59,522 --> 00:05:03,212
We have the heart here, here's the spine,
and these white dots--

81
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:04,802
can you guess what they are?

82
00:05:05,482 --> 00:05:09,173
They are the rib cage of this rodent.

83
00:05:09,732 --> 00:05:15,139
And if we select the display
to select the highest absorption,

84
00:05:15,139 --> 00:05:17,831
we are obviously going to look
for high electron density,

85
00:05:17,831 --> 00:05:19,378
that is, for calcium.

86
00:05:19,378 --> 00:05:22,947
This is the bone--and so this
is a very nice, high resolution image

87
00:05:22,947 --> 00:05:27,248
of the full body skeleton of a rodent

88
00:05:27,248 --> 00:05:28,978
in this example.

89
00:05:30,098 --> 00:05:34,614
The use of intravenous contrast agents
can be used to depict blood vessels.

90
00:05:34,614 --> 00:05:38,167
The change in contrast 
can be extracted from the images.

91
00:05:38,167 --> 00:05:41,701
It's color coded in this image in red,
so we see the vasculature.

92
00:05:41,701 --> 00:05:46,492
And this is superimposed on a image
that's been thresholded for the skeleton.

93
00:05:46,492 --> 00:05:50,097
So, we see the skeleton of the animal
and the vasculature

94
00:05:50,097 --> 00:05:53,156
where the contrast agent
has been going into.

95
00:05:53,156 --> 00:05:58,789
So, this is a way to illustrate
the architecture of the blood vessels

96
00:05:58,789 --> 00:06:02,113
in the animal, superimposed 
on normal anatomy,

97
00:06:02,113 --> 00:06:04,214
so we can recognize where they are.

98
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:09,605
Before we go to the reconstruction
of the images, I want to discuss

99
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:13,806
what the absorption 
that we've discussed last week--

100
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:15,939
what that means in the real world.

101
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:17,444
We're going to mainly be talking

102
00:06:17,444 --> 00:06:20,929
about the linear 
attenuation coefficient <i>μ</i>, here.

103
00:06:21,279 --> 00:06:22,460
Let's go back.

104
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:26,137
And we'll assume here, 
we have a tissue of thickness <i>dx</i>--

105
00:06:26,137 --> 00:06:29,506
this is a very small thickness--
you can imagine it's a micron,

106
00:06:30,836 --> 00:06:33,088
nanometer, something like that.

107
00:06:33,088 --> 00:06:34,816
Just very, very small.

108
00:06:35,656 --> 00:06:39,435
We then have a number of photons, <i>n</i>,
that come to this slice,

109
00:06:39,435 --> 00:06:44,813
and then we have a number of photons
<i>n - dn</i>, that pass through the slice.

110
00:06:44,813 --> 00:06:50,187
So, <i>dn</i> photons here, in this example,
are being absorbed by this tissue layer

111
00:06:50,187 --> 00:06:52,662
of thickness <i>dx</i>.

112
00:06:54,262 --> 00:06:57,583
We've had talked last week
about the linear attenuation coefficient,

113
00:06:57,583 --> 00:07:00,140
which has units of one over centimeter.

114
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,570
And if we assumed 
that over the thickness of <i>dx</i>, here,

115
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:05,880
which is a good and fair assumption,

116
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:08,732
we have seen
that the number of photons

117
00:07:08,732 --> 00:07:14,495
at the position <i>x</i> is given by the number
of photons impacting the layer <i>N_0</i>

118
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:17,307
times e to the <i>- μ x</i>.

119
00:07:17,307 --> 00:07:19,663
Now, if <i>dx</i> is very small, 
we can always assume

120
00:07:19,663 --> 00:07:22,444
that <i>μ</i> is constant in <i>x.</i>

121
00:07:23,454 --> 00:07:26,998
The measurements so that we want--
for which we want to reconstruct,

122
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:31,201
is a two-dimensional image
of the linear attenuation coefficient,

123
00:07:31,201 --> 00:07:35,019
so I'll write it here as the function <i>μ</i>
of <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>.

124
00:07:36,271 --> 00:07:39,374
But what is actually measured
is the number of photons

125
00:07:39,374 --> 00:07:41,103
that arrive in the detector.

126
00:07:41,613 --> 00:07:45,081
So, how is the link
between those two measurements--

127
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:46,601
let's look at that.

128
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:50,530
Well, it's actually a simple logarithm--
so the logarithm of the measured photons

129
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:56,270
divided by the photons impacting the layer
that is equal to <i>- μ x</i>.

130
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,716
And since we know <i>x</i>, we can, 
in this simple example,

131
00:07:59,716 --> 00:08:02,855
we can infer the linear attenuation
coefficient.

132
00:08:04,819 --> 00:08:08,388
This, here, is the example,
for a homogeneous object

133
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,953
with thickness <i>x</i>, here.

134
00:08:09,953 --> 00:08:13,777
So, we have assumed here that this
is <i>x</i>, for this example.

135
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,320
Now, contrast is well defined 
for monochromatic x-rays.

136
00:08:20,678 --> 00:08:24,928
We have the linear attenuation coefficient
for a certain photon energy

137
00:08:24,928 --> 00:08:28,057
in kiloelectron volts-- 
that is a well defined parameter--

138
00:08:28,557 --> 00:08:31,873
and so, we get
a very well defined contrast.

139
00:08:32,343 --> 00:08:35,420
But, we have seen that the linear
attenuation coefficient

140
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:39,332
depends on the photon energy,
it depends on the atomic number,

141
00:08:39,332 --> 00:08:41,722
and it depends on the electron density.

142
00:08:43,435 --> 00:08:47,455
This has some consequences in real life.

143
00:08:47,455 --> 00:08:50,707
And one of the consequences
is beam hardening,

144
00:08:50,707 --> 00:08:54,362
and the other one is depth dependent
contrast.

145
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,601
And this you can imagine
in the following way.

146
00:08:59,781 --> 00:09:04,088
When the photons arrive at the tissue,
they have a certain spectrum of energy,

147
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:08,009
and this spectrum of energy
has different absorption,

148
00:09:08,009 --> 00:09:11,922
so, the linear attenuation coefficient
depends on the energy of the photon in <i>μ</i>.

149
00:09:12,386 --> 00:09:18,162
And so, we have a higher absorption,
typically, at the lower energies--

150
00:09:18,162 --> 00:09:20,554
so that means that the [inaudible]
being removed

151
00:09:20,854 --> 00:09:25,473
and the energy of the photons 
that pass deeper into tissue,

152
00:09:25,473 --> 00:09:29,733
the average energy, increases,
and that's what's called beam hardening.

153
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:34,425
And that is because the <i>μ</i> is dependent
on the photon energy,

154
00:09:34,425 --> 00:09:38,498
we are getting a depth dependent contrast.

155
00:09:39,907 --> 00:09:42,274
So, let's look at this in the real world.

156
00:09:42,274 --> 00:09:46,574
And we will first focus 
on the energy spectrum of an x-ray tube--

157
00:09:46,574 --> 00:09:48,416
what this really looks like.

158
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:52,515
So, this is the relative output 
on the <i>y</i> axis--

159
00:09:52,515 --> 00:09:56,260
on the <i>x</i> axis, we have the photon energy
in kiloelectron volts,

160
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:00,362
and we have the distribution
of the density of the photons

161
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:03,217
for a given energy window plotted here.

162
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:07,646
What we have first, is the bremsstrahlung
continuum.

163
00:10:07,646 --> 00:10:12,423
Remember, we had talked two weeks ago
how x-rays are being generated--

164
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:15,255
they are generated, primarily,
by bremsstrahlung,

165
00:10:15,255 --> 00:10:19,384
and we cannot predict exactly
what the energy--

166
00:10:20,194 --> 00:10:22,954
the precise energy is, 
so, there is a continuum--

167
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:26,642
a distribution of photon energies
that are given.

168
00:10:27,634 --> 00:10:30,274
We have also characteristic x-rays--

169
00:10:30,274 --> 00:10:32,986
that is, when we remove 
an inner shell electron--

170
00:10:32,986 --> 00:10:34,851
so called radiation spikes,

171
00:10:34,851 --> 00:10:38,211
or characteristic x-rays, 
or fluorescent x-rays--

172
00:10:38,211 --> 00:10:42,298
and this is the interaction
with orbital electrons--

173
00:10:42,678 --> 00:10:47,083
and here we have the K_α_1,
α_2, and the K_β lines, here,

174
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,658
for tungsten.

175
00:10:50,611 --> 00:10:54,645
What we do know, there is one fundamental
constant that is fixed,

176
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:58,201
and that is the maximum photon energy--
this photon energy, here,

177
00:10:58,201 --> 00:11:02,714
in this example, is 90 kiloelectron
volts-- it is given by the voltage

178
00:11:02,714 --> 00:11:06,412
applied on the x-ray tube
across the anode and cathode,

179
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:10,930
in this case, it was 90 kiloelectron 
volts-- so, this is a fundamental limit--

180
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,708
it is defined by the operator,
we can set it in the scanner,

181
00:11:15,698 --> 00:11:18,642
but this is the maximum that we have.

182
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:21,213
We cannot have a photon energy
that's higher than that.

183
00:11:21,213 --> 00:11:24,823
Comes simply from the fact 
that this photon energy is,

184
00:11:24,823 --> 00:11:29,734
when an electron impacts the anode target,

185
00:11:29,734 --> 00:11:31,904
loses all its energy at once

186
00:11:31,904 --> 00:11:33,825
into a single photon.

187
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:39,229
So, what we have is the total intensity--
that is total number of photons

188
00:11:39,229 --> 00:11:42,993
that are being produced--
is the integral of this function, here,

189
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:47,153
from zero to infinity,
of the relative output, here,

190
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:52,859
that's the intensity as a function
of the energy integrated over the energy.

191
00:11:53,949 --> 00:11:56,319
This is a complex function-- 
we don't really have

192
00:11:56,319 --> 00:11:58,732
a good mathematical or physical model

193
00:11:58,732 --> 00:12:02,692
to model it, so what we are looking at

194
00:12:02,692 --> 00:12:05,631
is to characterize it in a simpler way.

195
00:12:06,751 --> 00:12:11,390
And the way this is done is to define
a effective photon energy--

196
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,695
E effective.

197
00:12:12,695 --> 00:12:15,911
It kind of corresponds to the medium

198
00:12:15,911 --> 00:12:19,041
or median energy of the photons

199
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:21,716
that are seen by the subject.

200
00:12:21,716 --> 00:12:26,203
So, the effective energy, in this example,
would possibly be something like this,

201
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:31,681
from the x-rays that are leaving
the x-ray tube.

202
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:34,443
Now, here's a term that I need 
to introduce--

203
00:12:34,443 --> 00:12:37,918
that I'd like to introduce,
that is the term of soft x-rays.

204
00:12:37,918 --> 00:12:41,359
They are soft, because they have
low energy.

205
00:12:41,359 --> 00:12:47,168
They are called soft, because they
don't penetrate very deep into the tissue.

206
00:12:48,278 --> 00:12:52,951
And, in contrast, we have the hard x-rays-- 
they are high energy,

207
00:12:52,951 --> 00:12:56,830
they are more penetrating,
that's why they are called hard x-rays.

208
00:12:58,309 --> 00:13:01,188
Now, if we think about the process
of bremsstrahlung,

209
00:13:01,188 --> 00:13:06,710
the minimal energy of a photon
that is produced is close to zero.

210
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:11,527
So, in theory, it's possible to produce
very soft x-rays within x-ray tubes.

211
00:13:11,527 --> 00:13:13,444
But that's not what we see here
in this graph.

212
00:13:13,444 --> 00:13:16,906
We see the energy drop off here to zero
at around 10 keV.

213
00:13:18,315 --> 00:13:21,582
What we do have is a filtering
of the instrument--

214
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:24,866
remember, the x-rays are produced
in vacuum-- in an x-ray tube--

215
00:13:24,866 --> 00:13:28,507
we have a glass there where the x-rays
are being allowed to pass

216
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:30,011
towards the subject.

217
00:13:30,011 --> 00:13:33,513
And that glass filters 
the very soft x-rays,

218
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:35,047
and nothing goes through.

219
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:39,490
So, we're having this instrument 
filtering, here, from the glass,

220
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:43,970
for example, that removes photons--
and one consequence of that

221
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:48,947
is that the effective energy
is actually shifted to higher energies.

222
00:13:48,947 --> 00:13:53,731
So, the overall x-ray spectrum,
or the x-rays that impact the patient

223
00:13:53,731 --> 00:13:55,614
are becoming harder.

224
00:13:56,554 --> 00:13:59,867
So, this increase in effective energy

225
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:03,647
is filtering of soft x-rays

226
00:14:03,647 --> 00:14:07,619
is done by the instrument, 
and this removal will lead

227
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:11,621
to an x-ray spectrum that's shifted

228
00:14:11,621 --> 00:14:13,701
to higher energies, and therefore,

229
00:14:13,701 --> 00:14:15,454
harder x-rays.

230
00:14:17,037 --> 00:14:22,086
So, what is the consequence
of energy dependent absorption?

231
00:14:23,667 --> 00:14:26,553
So, we have a similar consequence
to what we just discussed

232
00:14:26,553 --> 00:14:28,931
with the instrument in the tissue.

233
00:14:29,651 --> 00:14:32,070
Let's look at the linear attenuation
coefficient, here.

234
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:34,895
We have the x-ray energy from zero
to a hundred kiloelectron volts

235
00:14:34,895 --> 00:14:36,244
on the x-axis.

236
00:14:36,624 --> 00:14:39,950
And we have a logarithmic scale
of the linear attenuation coefficient

237
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:41,397
on the y-axis.

238
00:14:41,837 --> 00:14:45,715
In the ranges that we are concerned
for x-ray imaging, for CT imaging,

239
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:49,509
we're dealing only with a photoelectric
effect and the Compton effect.

240
00:14:50,987 --> 00:14:56,571
Now, as we can see, at low energies,
we have a stronger dominance

241
00:14:56,571 --> 00:15:00,133
of the photoelectric effect--
so the linear attenuation coefficient

242
00:15:00,133 --> 00:15:03,492
increases quite substantially 
at low energies.

243
00:15:04,316 --> 00:15:08,810
Now, what does this mean
for the real world?

244
00:15:11,143 --> 00:15:14,105
Let's look what we would have, ideally--
ideally, we would have

245
00:15:14,105 --> 00:15:15,556
monochromatic x-rays.

246
00:15:15,556 --> 00:15:19,073
The monochromatic x-rays--
we would be at this position--

247
00:15:19,073 --> 00:15:23,719
we would have 
a uniform absorption of the x-ray;

248
00:15:23,719 --> 00:15:25,859
the photon energy does not change.

249
00:15:26,149 --> 00:15:29,074
But in reality, we have polychromatic

250
00:15:29,074 --> 00:15:33,104
multi-energetic x-rays.

251
00:15:34,434 --> 00:15:39,321
So, the consequence is that we have--
the absorption is not uniform--

252
00:15:39,321 --> 00:15:41,113
with photon energy.

253
00:15:41,113 --> 00:15:45,237
Here, clearly, the linear attenuation
coefficient is not uniform, so it changes.

254
00:15:46,237 --> 00:15:49,959
The contrast, therefore, changes
with large objects and with depth.

255
00:15:50,594 --> 00:15:56,052
Another consequence is we have excessive
radiation dose to superficial tissue.

256
00:15:56,662 --> 00:15:58,395
So, let's talk about first consequence:

257
00:15:58,395 --> 00:16:00,451
contrast changes with large objects.

258
00:16:01,191 --> 00:16:05,391
We have, as the x-rays impact--
let's say we have a distribution

259
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:07,618
of x-ray energies over this range--

260
00:16:07,618 --> 00:16:11,608
we have, first, a removal of the intensity

261
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:14,689
at the low photon energy--
so, we have a contribution

262
00:16:14,689 --> 00:16:18,492
of the photoelectric effect
to the contrast mechanism.

263
00:16:18,792 --> 00:16:24,256
As the x-ray beam traverses the tissue,
these photons are preferentially removed,

264
00:16:24,256 --> 00:16:28,822
and so we have an increase in contribution
of Compton effect

265
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:32,568
to the absorption of x-rays.

266
00:16:32,568 --> 00:16:35,770
So, we have a shift from photoelectric
effect to Compton effect.

267
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:40,439
Obviously, if you imagine that this
is skin here, then we are looking, here,

268
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:46,383
at a removal of the photons, primarily
in the superficial tissues, skin, fat,

269
00:16:46,383 --> 00:16:48,608
and so on, and therefore,

270
00:16:48,608 --> 00:16:52,068
a higher radiation dose to these tissues.

271
00:16:53,648 --> 00:16:56,267
How can we mitigate this effect?

272
00:16:56,997 --> 00:17:02,159
So, the solution is actually 
to reduce the photon intensity

273
00:17:02,159 --> 00:17:05,642
for soft x-rays, that is, 
for low energies, in this range here--

274
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:11,862
we'd like to have not too much energy
here, and this can be, for example, done

275
00:17:11,862 --> 00:17:15,098
with inserting 
a 3 millimeter aluminum plate,

276
00:17:15,098 --> 00:17:20,238
which eliminates 90% 
of the 20 keV photons.
