1
00:00:04,683 --> 00:00:07,823
In this segment, I want to provide 
some examples

2
00:00:07,823 --> 00:00:11,733
some image examples to illustrate

3
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:15,803
the type of images that CT can provide.

4
00:00:15,803 --> 00:00:19,094
This is the image of a human head.

5
00:00:19,874 --> 00:00:24,244
We have bright, we have 
high electron densities

6
00:00:24,244 --> 00:00:26,394
and this is bone high absorption.

7
00:00:26,394 --> 00:00:28,573
We can see the skull here.

8
00:00:28,573 --> 00:00:31,963
We see the sinuses here;

9
00:00:31,963 --> 00:00:34,384
the air is dark, these are the sinuses.

10
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:38,224
That's the stuff that clogs up 
when you have a cold.

11
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:43,224
We're looking here 
at an image of the abdomen.

12
00:00:43,224 --> 00:00:45,634
Here's the spinal cord.

13
00:00:45,634 --> 00:00:51,785
This is the spine so again 
we're seeing calcification absorption,

14
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,784
and we have, obviously, 
different densities of tissue

15
00:00:55,784 --> 00:00:57,704
that give us intermediate results.

16
00:00:57,704 --> 00:01:00,254
There are not so easily discernible here.

17
00:01:00,254 --> 00:01:01,785
We have in here in the lungs

18
00:01:01,785 --> 00:01:04,835
and the air outside [billow] intensity.

19
00:01:04,835 --> 00:01:06,904
Now I mentioned earlier that

20
00:01:06,904 --> 00:01:10,876
the Hounsfield unit allows us 
to quantify the pixel intensity.

21
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:15,185
So we can actually-- the operator can 
set the pixel intensity

22
00:01:15,185 --> 00:01:19,965
on the computer display 
to depict different contrasts.

23
00:01:19,965 --> 00:01:21,785
So here is just the same image,

24
00:01:21,785 --> 00:01:24,735
taken the same image here, 
displayed in different ways.

25
00:01:24,735 --> 00:01:26,797
Here is one way.

26
00:01:26,797 --> 00:01:31,545
We don't really see much.
It's rather grayish.

27
00:01:31,545 --> 00:01:35,256
And here is a different highlight 
we're seeing very nicely,

28
00:01:35,256 --> 00:01:37,934
we're seeing the ribcage here;

29
00:01:37,934 --> 00:01:40,768
we're seeing the spine back here,

30
00:01:40,768 --> 00:01:43,665
and if we want to see 
soft tissue contrast,

31
00:01:43,665 --> 00:01:48,415
we can extend the contrast 
to see the very low intensity.

32
00:01:48,415 --> 00:01:51,488
Here we're starting to see 
[villa] contrast here in the lungs

33
00:01:51,488 --> 00:01:55,657
but obviously stuff that has 
very high absorption on the outside

34
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,544
is now very bright.

35
00:01:57,544 --> 00:02:02,566
So we can play with the look up
table of image presentation.

36
00:02:02,566 --> 00:02:05,706
Now there's a very famous 
example here from the Alps,

37
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:08,207
from our mountains, 
not in Switzerland I must say,

38
00:02:08,207 --> 00:02:15,505
[inaudible] the Austrian Italian Alps,
at the Austrian Italian border

39
00:02:16,095 --> 00:02:23,406
this gentleman was discovered 
following the retreat of the glaciers.

40
00:02:23,406 --> 00:02:26,075
He lived some 4,000 years ago,

41
00:02:26,075 --> 00:02:30,905
and the question was how did he die?

42
00:02:30,905 --> 00:02:32,274
That was the curiousity.

43
00:02:32,274 --> 00:02:33,444
It's a mummified body.

44
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:38,167
We do not want to go in 
with a scalpel and cut him open.

45
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:44,126
And his name is Otzi, so here he is 
wrapped nicely in a blanket

46
00:02:44,126 --> 00:02:49,176
entering the CT scanner 
and that's what people have done

47
00:02:49,176 --> 00:02:51,576
and what was found is that

48
00:02:51,576 --> 00:02:55,205
there was an arrowhead 
that was dislodged in his shoulder,

49
00:02:55,205 --> 00:02:59,256
around here, so probably 
he died of consequences

50
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:06,696
of being shot by an arrow up there 
in the mountains 4,000 years ago.

51
00:03:06,696 --> 00:03:10,636
So this is a way where modern 
biomedical imaging was used

52
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:17,507
to understand what happened 
to this person 5,000 years ago

53
00:03:17,507 --> 00:03:20,535
showing this dislodged arrowhead.

54
00:03:21,525 --> 00:03:25,316
I want to go on with some examples 
from mouse imaging.

55
00:03:25,316 --> 00:03:29,517
This is the rodent spine, 
so it's a 3D image

56
00:03:29,517 --> 00:03:31,357
CT scan of the spine

57
00:03:31,357 --> 00:03:36,366
that is human mesenchymal
stem cell treatment,

58
00:03:36,366 --> 00:03:38,626
and there is at the site of treatment,

59
00:03:38,626 --> 00:03:41,747
there is significant bone formation 
here and here,

60
00:03:41,747 --> 00:03:44,858
in these parts of the image.

61
00:03:44,858 --> 00:03:50,086
Here's an example 
from the head of an animal.

62
00:03:50,086 --> 00:03:52,508
This is pre-contrast agent injection.

63
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:54,267
There's not much we can see here

64
00:03:54,267 --> 00:03:56,367
and after contrast agent has been injected

65
00:03:56,367 --> 00:03:58,597
we start to see some intensity here

66
00:03:58,597 --> 00:04:01,686
at this part of the vasculature.

67
00:04:01,686 --> 00:04:04,835
Same approach, we can take contrast agents

68
00:04:04,835 --> 00:04:08,348
and, for example, MHD

69
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:11,495
the vasculature 
of the placenta of a mouse.

70
00:04:11,495 --> 00:04:13,048
Now imagine how small a mouse is,

71
00:04:13,048 --> 00:04:14,997
imagine how small a placenta is

72
00:04:14,997 --> 00:04:17,869
for mouse embryos in a mouse mother,

73
00:04:17,869 --> 00:04:21,737
and this is the vasculature 
of the placenta of a mouse

74
00:04:21,737 --> 00:04:26,008
with 13 micron spatial resolution.

75
00:04:26,008 --> 00:04:29,558
And finally here an example 
of the mouse femur bone

76
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:32,329
with growth hormone treatment

77
00:04:32,329 --> 00:04:35,176
looking at the bone here 
and then if you look at the structure

78
00:04:35,176 --> 00:04:38,845
inside we see the difference 
in structure here,

79
00:04:40,985 --> 00:04:44,746
how this is effected by the treatment.

80
00:04:44,746 --> 00:04:47,346
We can very clearly see this very nicely

81
00:04:47,346 --> 00:04:51,875
with high resolution CT, micro CT.

82
00:04:52,795 --> 00:04:58,725
So now I want to do 
a brief summary of CT.

83
00:04:58,725 --> 00:05:02,136
Computer tomography is done 
by x-ray absorption,

84
00:05:03,326 --> 00:05:04,956
that's the main contrast mechanism

85
00:05:05,137 --> 00:05:07,162
and the main contrast that we can see is

86
00:05:07,162 --> 00:05:09,696
bone versus soft tissue or air,

87
00:05:09,696 --> 00:05:12,888
and this is the underlining 
reason for that is

88
00:05:12,888 --> 00:05:17,296
that one primarily measures 
the electron density, rho.

89
00:05:17,296 --> 00:05:21,377
One can use a contrast agents 
which increase the effective 𝚭

90
00:05:21,377 --> 00:05:25,927
to depict vascular architecture 
or legions.

91
00:05:25,927 --> 00:05:28,223
So contrast agents are useful;

92
00:05:28,223 --> 00:05:31,948
they can be used in addition.

93
00:05:31,948 --> 00:05:35,435
Here's an example of genetic research.

94
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,984
We have insects.

95
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:40,354
This is an insect with 
iodine contrast agent.

96
00:05:40,354 --> 00:05:46,035
We have beautiful contrast 
in these images here of this insect

97
00:05:46,035 --> 00:05:50,550
profused with an iodine bearing 
contrast agent.

98
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:53,472
Now some considerations 
on single to noise ratio

99
00:05:53,472 --> 00:05:55,727
and contrast to noise ratio.

100
00:05:55,727 --> 00:05:58,386
In principle we can just increase 
the cathode current

101
00:05:58,386 --> 00:06:00,431
until we saturate the filament.

102
00:06:00,431 --> 00:06:02,825
So we can increase this intensity

103
00:06:02,825 --> 00:06:05,597
and so we can increase the SNR

104
00:06:06,757 --> 00:06:09,462
to almost unlimited levels,

105
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:13,662
and therefore we can have 
a very high spatial resolution.

106
00:06:13,662 --> 00:06:14,802
That's what we see here.

107
00:06:14,802 --> 00:06:19,322
With this very high 
spatial resolution image of the insect.

108
00:06:21,092 --> 00:06:25,675
However, in humans we are limited 
by the radiation dose

109
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,793
that we can apply this to.

110
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:31,540
Here's another example.

111
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:35,060
This is fish larva, just imagine
how small the fish larva are.

112
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,120
These are the eyes of this fish

113
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,740
and again, very high resolution images.

114
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:41,290
We see the brain here,

115
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,690
spinal cord here.

116
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,641
Very high resolution 
is possible in animals

117
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:52,130
where we are less concerned 
with radiation exposure.

118
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:55,769
So to summarize, I've given you 
the basic principle

119
00:06:55,769 --> 00:06:58,640
of CT imagery construction,

120
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,471
some real life considerations,

121
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:04,598
and actually if you look 
over the decades--

122
00:07:04,598 --> 00:07:08,172
this is now almost--

123
00:07:08,172 --> 00:07:13,272
this is over four decades 
of scanner development,

124
00:07:13,272 --> 00:07:19,451
we have seen quite a number 
of generations of scanners developed.

125
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:23,318
We've had parallel, first generation, 
second and third generation,

126
00:07:24,612 --> 00:07:29,533
of the scanners and this is 
what we are seeing in the video

127
00:07:29,533 --> 00:07:33,129
are the different generation scanners.

128
00:07:33,129 --> 00:07:35,240
We're starting out with the simplest one.

129
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,855
There was one scanner, one line

130
00:07:38,855 --> 00:07:40,569
collected at a time.

131
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:45,410
Then we had a small fan being 
third generation multiple scanners, etc.,

132
00:07:45,410 --> 00:07:48,454
so increased complexity 
and actually in the meantime

133
00:07:48,454 --> 00:07:51,556
we're up to the fifth generation scanners

134
00:07:51,556 --> 00:07:57,280
which are produced--
they have--

135
00:07:57,701 --> 00:08:01,020
start with the third generation
multiple detectors;

136
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,894
then we have the fourth generation;

137
00:08:03,894 --> 00:08:06,361
we have a detector ring, a large fan beam,

138
00:08:06,361 --> 00:08:08,231
and nowadays actually 
scanning is done

139
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:10,637
as the subject continuously
moves through the scanner.

140
00:08:10,637 --> 00:08:15,059
It's a spiral way of scanning 
the subject, very efficient.

141
00:08:15,059 --> 00:08:18,110
You can scan an entire body 
within a few seconds

142
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:25,630
and then reconstruct it, obviously, 
now possible with today's computing power.

143
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:27,790
As to the cost of a CT scanner,

144
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:30,662
it is on the order of-- 
depends of course on the company,

145
00:08:30,662 --> 00:08:32,181
depends on the currency here,

146
00:08:32,181 --> 00:08:36,081
but of the techniques 
we're discussing in this course

147
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:38,563
it is...

148
00:08:39,762 --> 00:08:42,351
the cheapest technique aside 
from ultrasound,

149
00:08:42,351 --> 00:08:46,643
a few hundred thousand take it 
Euro, Dollar, or Swiss Franc,

150
00:08:46,643 --> 00:08:49,585
it's roughly the same thing.

151
00:08:49,585 --> 00:08:53,013
It's on the order of 
100 to 200,000 Swiss Franc.
