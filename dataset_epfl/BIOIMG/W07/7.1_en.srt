1
00:00:03,892 --> 00:00:06,175
Today's lecture
is going to be a bit different

2
00:00:06,175 --> 00:00:08,888
than the previous lectures
as we are not going to discuss

3
00:00:08,898 --> 00:00:11,339
an imaging modality per se.

4
00:00:11,339 --> 00:00:16,042
However, I feel that the topic
of understanding

5
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:20,152
how traces of contrast agents,
how they enter the tissue

6
00:00:20,152 --> 00:00:23,485
and how we can understand
their appearance in tissue

7
00:00:23,485 --> 00:00:25,872
is of wide-ranging importance.

8
00:00:25,872 --> 00:00:31,257
It's also important for processes
well beyond biomedical imaging

9
00:00:31,737 --> 00:00:33,971
such as pharmacokinetics, etc.

10
00:00:34,427 --> 00:00:38,175
And therefore, I wanted to spend
this small segment this week

11
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:43,795
on understanding
the kinetic models

12
00:00:43,795 --> 00:00:47,256
and how we obtain
metabolic information

13
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:49,641
or information
on the processes.

14
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,446
And so, here
the first question is:

15
00:00:52,446 --> 00:00:56,110
why is it important to understand
basic modeling of linear systems?

16
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,076
So let's take a situation.

17
00:00:59,076 --> 00:01:01,822
It's here presented
as a hypothetical situation

18
00:01:01,822 --> 00:01:05,611
but it actually does have some relevance
to what I've experienced in my career

19
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:10,681
and what is not infrequent to happen.

20
00:01:11,245 --> 00:01:14,293
So we'll take a situation here
where we have a team A,

21
00:01:14,293 --> 00:01:16,859
research team A,
that measures a high expression

22
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:20,659
of the message of a gene, the mRNA.

23
00:01:20,659 --> 00:01:24,393
Team B measures at the same
time point a low protein level.

24
00:01:25,853 --> 00:01:30,391
A year later, team C reports
a low mRNA of the same system

25
00:01:30,391 --> 00:01:34,046
whereas team D finds
a high protein level.

26
00:01:35,598 --> 00:01:38,296
So the question is:
Is this a controversy,

27
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:40,775
or is there a common
underlying explanation?

28
00:01:41,477 --> 00:01:44,786
Trust me, looking at these things
as they are reported

29
00:01:44,786 --> 00:01:47,885
for research teams,
conflicting findings

30
00:01:47,885 --> 00:01:51,378
this does give rise
to quite some controversy

31
00:01:51,378 --> 00:01:53,357
at scientific meetings.

32
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:57,438
So, let's try
to understand the situation.

33
00:01:57,438 --> 00:02:01,417
I'll plot here on the x-axis,
we'll have the time here

34
00:02:02,987 --> 00:02:08,433
and now, what we are plotting here
in red, is the expression of the gene

35
00:02:08,433 --> 00:02:10,896
that's the mRNA
as it has been measured

36
00:02:10,896 --> 00:02:14,357
or as it... let's say this 
is what's happening in the system.

37
00:02:14,357 --> 00:02:18,853
And then let's look at the protein level
of that particular gene,

38
00:02:18,853 --> 00:02:21,206
so the protein
that's being expressed.

39
00:02:22,424 --> 00:02:24,949
Those two time courses
are not the same.

40
00:02:25,586 --> 00:02:30,240
So we have here now situation 1

41
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,977
when the measurement was done, 
at this time point.

42
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:37,798
Situation 2 corresponds
to a measurement

43
00:02:37,798 --> 00:02:39,790
at a later time point.

44
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:44,390
So, if in the discussion
of these seemingly controversial results

45
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:53,598
we omit the factor time
here on the horizontal axis

46
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:59,283
we can very well enter 
into considerable controversies

47
00:02:59,283 --> 00:03:02,085
that are actually,
if you look at now this graph

48
00:03:02,085 --> 00:03:03,679
we're not looking at a controversy--

49
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:05,544
we're just looking
at different time points.

50
00:03:05,964 --> 00:03:09,636
The system we're discussing
here is TNA2.

51
00:03:09,636 --> 00:03:14,519
Expression, the mRNA,
and finally the translation

52
00:03:18,489 --> 00:03:20,017
to the protein.

53
00:03:20,017 --> 00:03:23,348
And what we're looking at here
is essentially a biochemical reaction.

54
00:03:23,849 --> 00:03:27,771
We have the precursor,
that's the mRNA

55
00:03:27,771 --> 00:03:30,626
and we have the product,
which is the protein.

56
00:03:30,986 --> 00:03:34,030
Clearly, we cannot have
protein being expressed

57
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:36,766
before we have the gene
being expressed

58
00:03:36,766 --> 00:03:39,943
or the protein's not synthesized
before we have the signal

59
00:03:39,943 --> 00:03:43,107
in the cell that this protein
should be expressed.

60
00:03:43,107 --> 00:03:47,121
So there's a causality issue here,
and the mRNA has to precede

61
00:03:47,121 --> 00:03:49,754
the expression of the protein.

62
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:54,539
So this is situation 1,
and this is situation 2.

63
00:03:54,539 --> 00:03:57,689
Two different time points,
if you look at it from this standpoint

64
00:03:57,689 --> 00:04:01,776
then actually our conclusion must be
there is no controversy

65
00:04:01,776 --> 00:04:04,703
we've just been looking
at different time points.

66
00:04:05,586 --> 00:04:09,950
Now the system
of product-precursor relationship

67
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:13,331
can be ascribed mathematically,
we can set up a model

68
00:04:13,331 --> 00:04:16,082
and the underlying
mathematical principles

69
00:04:16,082 --> 00:04:17,620
as we'll see in this lecture

70
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:20,199
they're actually fairly
generally applicable.

71
00:04:20,967 --> 00:04:23,551
We can apply them
to contrast agent dynamics,

72
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:26,404
uptake of contrast agent,
so instead of mRNA

73
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:28,221
we have contrast agent
in the blood

74
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:31,656
and instead of protein we have
contrast agent in the tissue.

75
00:04:32,556 --> 00:04:36,552
Enzyme kinetics, we have
the reaction velocity

76
00:04:36,552 --> 00:04:41,779
that goes up first, for example,
and the product buildup will come later.

77
00:04:41,779 --> 00:04:44,745
This cannot happen
any other way around.

78
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:47,160
Take diabetes as an example.

79
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:53,378
We have insulin, patients with diabetes
very often have to inject insulin,

80
00:04:53,378 --> 00:04:56,969
and the effect on glucose
uptake is delayed,

81
00:04:56,969 --> 00:05:00,627
so insulin first, then change
in glucose uptake

82
00:05:00,627 --> 00:05:03,569
predominantly in the muscles,
comes later.

83
00:05:04,809 --> 00:05:07,690
Sailing, for those of you who have
experience with sailing

84
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,217
you know very well
that if you change the rudder

85
00:05:10,217 --> 00:05:14,322
or the sail position, the change
in direction or the velocity of the boat

86
00:05:14,322 --> 00:05:16,495
that this takes some time.

87
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,524
Economics is also an example.

88
00:05:19,524 --> 00:05:21,259
If we change
the financial incentives

89
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:25,526
in the system, until that
changes the production

90
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:29,435
and the availability
of the product in the market

91
00:05:29,435 --> 00:05:33,024
that is also a relationship,
a causal relationship

92
00:05:33,024 --> 00:05:39,081
where we have a delayed response
to the input that's changing.

93
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:45,580
So the underlying principle here
in all cases, it is about inertia.

94
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,343
Its resistance to change.

95
00:05:47,343 --> 00:05:49,876
Things don't happen
instantaneously

96
00:05:49,876 --> 00:05:54,762
and this is the concept of inertia.

97
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:56,824
We've had, for those of you
who remember

98
00:05:56,824 --> 00:06:00,801
your freshman physics course
we have talked about inertial mass

99
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,630
in those courses.

100
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:06,589
Mass is the resistance to change
to velocity, Newton's second law

101
00:06:06,589 --> 00:06:10,714
also there, the concept exists in there,
and this is taken here

102
00:06:10,714 --> 00:06:13,271
in the example of sailing.

103
00:06:14,012 --> 00:06:17,816
Of the techniques
that are highly dependent

104
00:06:17,816 --> 00:06:21,603
on this description
and on a good understanding

105
00:06:21,603 --> 00:06:24,502
of the kinetics
that are happening

106
00:06:24,502 --> 00:06:27,851
is the FDG PET technique.

107
00:06:28,921 --> 00:06:31,357
And this is a technique
to measure

108
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:33,573
intracellular glucose metabolism.

109
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:37,589
So before I go into the specifics
of kinetic modeling

110
00:06:37,589 --> 00:06:39,711
I want to just give you
an overview

111
00:06:39,711 --> 00:06:43,059
of the processes
involved in measuring

112
00:06:43,059 --> 00:06:45,343
intracellular glucose metabolism

113
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:48,461
using fluoro-deoxyglucose,
or deoxyglucose.

114
00:06:49,137 --> 00:06:54,287
Now, the tracer molecule here, FDG,
is taken up into the cells

115
00:06:54,287 --> 00:06:57,783
and this uptake depends
on the expression of a protein

116
00:06:57,783 --> 00:06:58,802
called GLUT.

117
00:06:58,802 --> 00:07:01,029
GLUT here stands
for glucose transporter.

118
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:05,036
So, glucose cannot go across
the cell membranes.

119
00:07:05,036 --> 00:07:07,483
It needs a protein,
sort of like a channel

120
00:07:07,483 --> 00:07:10,823
that allows it to cross
the cell membrane

121
00:07:10,823 --> 00:07:14,105
and these are the glucose
transporter proteins.

122
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:19,576
It also depends, obviously,
on the glucose metabolism

123
00:07:19,576 --> 00:07:22,122
the uptake depends
also on the activity

124
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:25,042
of the first metabolic step
of glucose metabolism,

125
00:07:25,042 --> 00:07:29,656
that's glucose phosphorylation
mediated by the enzyme hexokinase.

126
00:07:31,896 --> 00:07:33,782
So, we'll look here at a cell.

127
00:07:33,782 --> 00:07:36,207
This is the cell membrane.

128
00:07:36,207 --> 00:07:41,022
We have here our glucose
transporter molecule, GLUT-1.

129
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:44,285
This is one isoform
of many isoforms,

130
00:07:44,285 --> 00:07:47,213
There's roughly nine
glucose transporter isoforms

131
00:07:47,213 --> 00:07:49,484
they've been described
in the literature.

132
00:07:49,484 --> 00:07:54,421
GLUT-1 is the one that's present
in the membranes of red blood cells

133
00:07:54,421 --> 00:07:57,998
and in most cells in our body.

134
00:07:58,668 --> 00:08:02,297
Here's the molecule,
that's the fluoro-deoxyglucose.

135
00:08:02,297 --> 00:08:06,081
We administer it,
it comes to the cell membrane

136
00:08:06,081 --> 00:08:12,115
and then traverses the transporter,
and thus the FDG molecule

137
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:14,620
ends up inside the cell.

138
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:20,342
This transport into the cell
can happen by GLUT-1.

139
00:08:21,022 --> 00:08:23,184
It can also happen
by other isoforms

140
00:08:23,184 --> 00:08:26,451
such as GLUT-3, GLUT-5,

141
00:08:26,451 --> 00:08:30,841
GLUT-3 being the isoform
at the neurons

142
00:08:30,841 --> 00:08:35,220
and GLUT-2, for example,
being the predominant transporter

143
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:38,320
in the pancreas, important for diabetes.

144
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:43,143
So now we are in the situation
that we have fluoro-deoxuglucose

145
00:08:43,143 --> 00:08:46,473
inside the cell, and now comes
the first metabolic reaction

146
00:08:46,473 --> 00:08:52,083
mediated by hexokinase,
and this process happens here

147
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,292
in attaching a phosphate
at the sixth position,

148
00:08:55,292 --> 00:08:59,412
thereby producing
fluoro-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate.

149
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:05,107
This molecule now
has interesting properties.

150
00:09:05,107 --> 00:09:09,683
Number one, it cannot be
further metabolized

151
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:12,045
by the next enzymatic
step in glycolysis

152
00:09:12,045 --> 00:09:16,949
so glucose-6-phosphate isomerase
does not metabolize glucose

153
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:21,780
deoxyglucose-6-phosphate,
so this, it does not go on.

154
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:26,655
And glucose-6-phosphate,
or deoxyglucose-6-phosphate

155
00:09:26,655 --> 00:09:29,324
is not transported
out of the cell.

156
00:09:29,324 --> 00:09:33,292
So, in a first approximation
and in simplification of the reality,

157
00:09:33,292 --> 00:09:39,033
we have fluoro-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate,
or deoxyglucose-6-phosphate,

158
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:42,515
is now metabolically 
trapped inside the cell,

159
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:48,066
and this is how FDG PET,
or deoxyglucose methods,

160
00:09:48,066 --> 00:09:52,095
measure glucose metabolism.

161
00:09:53,525 --> 00:09:57,289
Now, to give you an example
here, we'll take, actually not FDG

162
00:09:57,289 --> 00:10:03,001
but we'll take another deoxygluose,
it's the C14 or tritiated deoxyglucose

163
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:05,757
and the technique used here,
the example I'm giving

164
00:10:05,757 --> 00:10:07,398
is autoradiography.

165
00:10:07,738 --> 00:10:13,222
So what we're looking at here
are images of the brain in greyscale.

166
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:17,827
These are brain slices, so the brain
has been harvested

167
00:10:17,827 --> 00:10:22,421
cut into thin slices,
on the left you see

168
00:10:22,421 --> 00:10:25,141
the images, and on the right
in the color code

169
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,549
we see the glucose
metabolic rate

170
00:10:27,549 --> 00:10:30,105
with warms colors being
the higher metabolic rate

171
00:10:30,105 --> 00:10:33,604
and cool colors being
the lower glucose metabolic rate.

172
00:10:33,604 --> 00:10:37,714
So these brain slices are placed
on a radiographic film

173
00:10:37,714 --> 00:10:40,575
and then the emission
of the radioactivity

174
00:10:40,575 --> 00:10:47,112
from C14 and/or tritium,
those are beta particles,

175
00:10:47,112 --> 00:10:51,473
is being recorded on the film,
and this gives us the color coded images.

176
00:10:51,473 --> 00:10:54,061
This is an autoradiography
of a rodent brain,

177
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:57,315
and here is an example,
a close-up,

178
00:10:57,315 --> 00:11:00,494
this is showing
the columnar organization

179
00:11:00,494 --> 00:11:03,486
of the whisker barrel cortex,
where each of those columns

180
00:11:03,486 --> 00:11:07,693
corresponds to a specific whisker
with a higher uptake.

181
00:11:08,363 --> 00:11:12,448
So this is a very powerful technique
to measure glucose metabolism,

182
00:11:12,448 --> 00:11:15,439
and we will use it as an example

183
00:11:15,439 --> 00:11:20,904
throughout this lecture, Lecture 7,

184
00:11:20,904 --> 00:11:26,681
and in the end explain
how the FDG technique functions.

185
00:11:27,713 --> 00:11:31,447
So first, however, I want to introduce
some basic principles.

186
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:35,761
First of all, the question:
what is a compartmental model,

187
00:11:35,761 --> 00:11:39,181
or compartment model,
and this asks the question

188
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:41,365
of what is a compartment?

189
00:11:41,935 --> 00:11:44,300
So we'll take the definition
of a compartment here

190
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,567
that... we'll take the concept
that we have a physiological system

191
00:11:48,567 --> 00:11:54,714
and we'll decompose it, model it
into certain number N here,

192
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,395
given interacting subsystems.

193
00:11:58,105 --> 00:12:04,015
Those subsystems are typically a given
chemical species in a physical space.

194
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:07,176
That physical space is typically
called a compartment.

195
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:10,743
So we have, when
we give dexocyglucose

196
00:12:10,743 --> 00:12:14,465
we have glucose in the blood,
that's one compartment,

197
00:12:14,465 --> 00:12:17,180
glucose in the cell,
that's another compartment,

198
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,988
and then we have
phosphorolytic glucose

199
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,650
that's the third compartment.

200
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,907
We'll make the assumption here
that the tracer is considered

201
00:12:24,907 --> 00:12:28,100
to be uniformly distributed
in a given compartment.

202
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:32,003
There are very elaborate experiments
that would allow us to say something

203
00:12:32,003 --> 00:12:35,299
about where in the cell
this particular compound

204
00:12:35,299 --> 00:12:38,108
is located, but they are
very complicated experiments,

205
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:42,015
and for practical purposes,
in the context of biomedical imaging

206
00:12:42,015 --> 00:12:45,675
this is an assumption that one makes.

207
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:50,021
So what are the key elements
of compartmental modeling?

208
00:12:50,681 --> 00:12:54,452
Let's look at some major elements.

209
00:12:54,452 --> 00:12:57,769
First, the first one is,
the key element is we're going to try

210
00:12:57,769 --> 00:13:01,722
to make a prediction
of what's happening

211
00:13:01,722 --> 00:13:06,809
in a part of the body
that we have no direct access to.

212
00:13:07,129 --> 00:13:09,752
So, these are inaccessible
features of the system.

213
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:15,158
With deoxyglucose this would be
intracellular glucose metabolism.

214
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:21,009
So the inaccessible portion
is something inside the body,

215
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:24,187
inside the cells,
and we want get some ideas

216
00:13:24,187 --> 00:13:25,751
of what's going on here.

217
00:13:25,751 --> 00:13:28,051
So for example we could say
we have a model

218
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:30,732
taken from the chemistry
of metabolism.

219
00:13:30,732 --> 00:13:34,609
We have a chemical species A
that interconverts into species B

220
00:13:34,609 --> 00:13:38,552
and is also being converted
to species C.

221
00:13:38,552 --> 00:13:40,532
That would be
an example here.

222
00:13:41,142 --> 00:13:43,215
The second element
of a compartmental model

223
00:13:43,215 --> 00:13:45,852
is that we do the measurement
in an accessible portion.

224
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,623
So what is the accessible portion?

225
00:13:49,383 --> 00:13:52,841
That is essentially the measured output,

226
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:54,302
and what do we have access to?

227
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:56,638
Well, we typically have access
to the blood vessels,

228
00:13:56,638 --> 00:13:58,215
so we can take blood samples.

229
00:13:59,035 --> 00:14:01,570
And we, typically in imaging,
we have access

230
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:04,676
to the measurements that are being
done with the imaging technique

231
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:07,147
that is, to the value
of the pixels.

232
00:14:07,147 --> 00:14:11,679
So those are our accessible
features of the system.

233
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,497
So we'd like to have,
from the measurement in the blood

234
00:14:15,497 --> 00:14:19,044
from the pixels, this is our output,
we'd like to say something

235
00:14:19,044 --> 00:14:22,246
about what's going on here
inside our cells.

236
00:14:22,956 --> 00:14:26,999
We have also, of course,
a known input into the system.

237
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:31,398
So this is a given example here
of what's happening in the blood.

238
00:14:31,398 --> 00:14:33,808
We inject here
something very rapidly,

239
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:37,919
and this compound is decreased,
this can be a tracer,

240
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:41,303
this can be a contrast agent.

241
00:14:41,743 --> 00:14:44,784
So this part here,
that's our accessible portion

242
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,704
the blood measurement is here.

243
00:14:47,674 --> 00:14:51,137
And then, based on the measurements
in the accessible portion

244
00:14:51,137 --> 00:14:55,456
we're going to try to estimate
specific parameters of interest.

245
00:14:55,756 --> 00:15:00,251
One example already mentioned
is the metabolic rate of glucose.

246
00:15:00,251 --> 00:15:02,077
So here is an example.

247
00:15:02,417 --> 00:15:06,223
We have fluoro-deoxyglucose
in the blood

248
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:12,139
in the plasma, we have
the transport into the cell.

249
00:15:12,139 --> 00:15:14,480
Then we have
the free deoxygluose,

250
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,713
or free fluoro-deoxygluose,
inside the cell.

251
00:15:18,433 --> 00:15:21,673
And we have, then,
through the glucose metabolic rates

252
00:15:21,673 --> 00:15:24,031
we have 
the fluoro-deoxygluose-6-phosphate,

253
00:15:24,031 --> 00:15:26,928
or deoxygluose-6-phosphate.

254
00:15:26,928 --> 00:15:32,835
So these are the three
compartments: blood, brain, the species;

255
00:15:32,835 --> 00:15:34,365
metabolic--

256
00:15:34,365 --> 00:15:37,413
we have three compartments,
free glucose in the blood

257
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:42,373
free glucose in the tissue,
and phosphorolytic glucose in the tissue.

258
00:15:44,046 --> 00:15:47,710
Now, modeling...
assessing the kinetics,

259
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,879
we're making
steady-state assumptions.

260
00:15:49,879 --> 00:15:53,624
And there are two assumptions
here that are important to mention.

261
00:15:53,624 --> 00:15:57,062
One is that the metabolic rate
of the processes

262
00:15:57,062 --> 00:15:59,737
is not changing with time.

263
00:16:00,017 --> 00:16:02,989
So, we are assuming that,
for example,

264
00:16:02,989 --> 00:16:06,972
the rate of glucose metabolism
inside our cells

265
00:16:06,972 --> 00:16:09,591
as we do the measurement
is not changing.

266
00:16:09,591 --> 00:16:12,452
It may change, but what does it mean
if we make this assumption?

267
00:16:12,452 --> 00:16:16,067
It means we're calculating
an average value

268
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:18,197
of glucose metabolic rate.

269
00:16:19,077 --> 00:16:22,058
We're also assuming,
as a steady-state assumption

270
00:16:22,058 --> 00:16:25,640
that the concentrations
of all the compounds involved

271
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:29,960
and the enzymes, etc.,
are constant during the evaluation period.

272
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,922
With these two steady-state assumptions,
we can actually have

273
00:16:35,922 --> 00:16:41,471
a relatively straightforward
mathematical description

274
00:16:41,471 --> 00:16:45,366
of what is going on,
and that is, as we shall see,

275
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:49,202
that we can describe the processes,
the metabolic processes

276
00:16:49,202 --> 00:16:51,951
with first-order rate constants.

277
00:16:51,951 --> 00:16:57,457
They are not true rate constants,
so we'll call them pseudo-rate constants.

278
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:03,159
Before we go into the specifics
of the mathematical description

279
00:17:03,159 --> 00:17:07,131
of predicting what's going on
inside the cell based on what we measured

280
00:17:07,131 --> 00:17:11,227
in our pixels, and based 
on what we measured in the blood

281
00:17:11,227 --> 00:17:13,982
I want to introduce,
however, a technique

282
00:17:13,982 --> 00:17:18,824
that was used more than
a half-century ago

283
00:17:19,624 --> 00:17:24,232
that also allows
a rate detemination.

284
00:17:24,232 --> 00:17:27,078
And here, the principle
that is being used

285
00:17:27,078 --> 00:17:28,982
is conservation of mass.

286
00:17:28,982 --> 00:17:32,618
That already allows us
to make some statements

287
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:36,448
regarding what's going on
in the organ of interest.

288
00:17:37,178 --> 00:17:40,372
And this is based
on the Fick Principle.

289
00:17:40,822 --> 00:17:42,610
So, let's consider here
the situation.

290
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,627
We'll draw here the tissue,
that's our organ of interest

291
00:17:45,627 --> 00:17:46,915
or the tissue.

292
00:17:47,235 --> 00:17:48,765
We have, of course,
blood vessels

293
00:17:48,765 --> 00:17:51,597
that supply the tissue
with nutrients and oxygen

294
00:17:51,597 --> 00:17:55,702
and that remove
the metabolic end products.

295
00:17:55,702 --> 00:17:57,508
So, this a perfused organ.

296
00:17:57,718 --> 00:18:01,754
This is the blood, and here
we have the blood that flows

297
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:05,906
and the flow is indicated
by the parameter <i>f</i>.

298
00:18:05,906 --> 00:18:09,718
So as the blood flows,
it flows through the tissue,

299
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:12,618
the number of molecules
that goes in is equal

300
00:18:12,618 --> 00:18:15,393
to the number of molecules
that goes out,

301
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:19,655
if this molecule is not being used
by the tissue.

302
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:22,467
So now, let's assume
that we are looking

303
00:18:22,467 --> 00:18:24,459
at a particular molecule here.

304
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:27,099
We'll just stay abstract
for the moment.

305
00:18:27,449 --> 00:18:30,066
Here, these are the molecules
that are coming in.

306
00:18:30,066 --> 00:18:33,522
And now the tissue
is taking up these molecules.

307
00:18:33,772 --> 00:18:35,958
Taking it up, storing it,

308
00:18:36,218 --> 00:18:38,632
or taking it up and converting it
to something else

309
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:40,142
that we don't measure.

310
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:43,426
So an example is,
if we take oxygen

311
00:18:43,426 --> 00:18:47,544
oxygen 15, we've seen last week,
it is a PET tracer,

312
00:18:47,544 --> 00:18:50,487
so if we take oxygen 15,
molecular oxygen 15,

313
00:18:50,487 --> 00:18:54,262
we breathe it, then we get
the oxygen here coming in

314
00:18:54,262 --> 00:18:57,152
and what goes out is H2O 15.

315
00:18:57,152 --> 00:19:00,570
We can say the same thing
with other compounds.

316
00:19:01,290 --> 00:19:04,223
So, now we'll define this consumption

317
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:08,713
of this particular compound x
here I'll call it x.

318
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:12,336
We'll call that the metabolic
rate of x, or MRx.

319
00:19:12,726 --> 00:19:16,429
That's the metabolic rate
in the tissue

320
00:19:16,429 --> 00:19:20,602
at the rate at which this compound
is being consumed.

321
00:19:21,832 --> 00:19:24,226
Now, we'll have 
a certain concentration of this compound

322
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:27,653
on the supply side,
so, on the arterial side,

323
00:19:27,653 --> 00:19:29,612
that is, on the blood
entering the tissue.

324
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:32,015
I'll call this concentration "x in".

325
00:19:32,015 --> 00:19:34,533
And we'll have a concentration
of this compound

326
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:37,768
in the blood that leaves the tissue,
and we'll call that "x out".

327
00:19:38,488 --> 00:19:40,817
And so now what we have is

328
00:19:40,817 --> 00:19:46,566
the blood supply is a certain number 
of molecules per second,

329
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:51,033
a certain number of molecules
per second or per minute is being removed

330
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:56,522
and so, fewer molecules per minute
are leaving the tissue,

331
00:19:56,522 --> 00:19:59,140
are leaving by the bloodstream.

332
00:20:00,198 --> 00:20:03,310
And if we now look
at mass conservation

333
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,170
this simply dictates
that the number of molecules

334
00:20:06,170 --> 00:20:09,277
that is, the metabolic rate,
that are being consumed

335
00:20:09,277 --> 00:20:11,900
is equal to the number
of molecules coming in

336
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,573
that's blood flow times
the concentration of blood

337
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:19,850
entering the tissue, minus the number
of molecules leaving the tissue;

338
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:24,779
that's blood flow times the concentration
of blood leaving the tissue.

339
00:20:25,119 --> 00:20:28,890
So this gives us the metabolic rate
of this compound.

340
00:20:29,746 --> 00:20:32,920
Now, <i>x</i> here could give you
something specific.

341
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:36,287
<i>x</i> here can be oxygen,
so we have oxygen coming in,

342
00:20:36,287 --> 00:20:38,968
oxygen leaving, and oxygen
being consumed.

343
00:20:38,968 --> 00:20:43,144
It can be glucose, can be ammonia,
or it can also be water

344
00:20:43,144 --> 00:20:44,501
for this principle.

345
00:20:45,651 --> 00:20:49,199
Now let's look 
at brain physiology as an example.

346
00:20:50,469 --> 00:20:54,355
We know from physiological
experiments and by experience

347
00:20:54,355 --> 00:20:58,134
that if we are in a dark room
and we suddenly look,

348
00:20:58,134 --> 00:21:04,094
for example, at an image, we have
in certain regions of the brain

349
00:21:04,105 --> 00:21:08,695
a quite strong increase
in blood flow

350
00:21:08,695 --> 00:21:11,075
but hardly a change
in oxygen consumption.

351
00:21:11,545 --> 00:21:14,012
So, oxygen consumption
does not increase

352
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:16,043
in parallel with the blood flow.

353
00:21:17,336 --> 00:21:19,382
So what is the consequence?

354
00:21:21,156 --> 00:21:22,482
Think about it.

355
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:26,308
So we're increasing
the blood flow much more

356
00:21:26,308 --> 00:21:29,652
than the consumption here,
the metabolic rate.

357
00:21:30,448 --> 00:21:32,589
You can think of it...
take an extreme case.

358
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:37,500
Let's assume 
that the blood flow is increasing

359
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,808
but the metabolic rate
is not changing.

360
00:21:40,318 --> 00:21:44,156
So we have no change
in oxygen consumption

361
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:45,877
but we have
an increase in blood flow.

362
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:49,488
If we have no change
in metabolic rate

363
00:21:49,938 --> 00:21:53,500
but this increases,
the blood flow increases

364
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,517
then the difference
in concentration

365
00:21:55,517 --> 00:21:58,050
between what's happening
in the supply side

366
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,656
and the output side
in the blood flow

367
00:22:00,656 --> 00:22:02,851
this difference has to reduce.

368
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:08,592
So, now, the arterial concentration
of oxygen is not going to change.

369
00:22:08,592 --> 00:22:12,302
There's no mechanism by which
an increased supply

370
00:22:12,302 --> 00:22:15,091
will change the concentration
of oxygen of the blood

371
00:22:15,091 --> 00:22:16,498
entering the tissue.

372
00:22:16,498 --> 00:22:19,704
So by consequence, 
the only thing that can happen here

373
00:22:19,704 --> 00:22:25,144
is that the oxygen concentration
in the venous effluent

374
00:22:25,144 --> 00:22:27,207
from the tissue is increasing,

375
00:22:27,207 --> 00:22:31,696
and so, therefore, the concentration
difference between in and out decreases.

376
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:35,119
So, we'll take 
this particular equation here.

377
00:22:35,119 --> 00:22:36,815
We'll rewrite it in terms of oxygen,

378
00:22:36,815 --> 00:22:40,963
so oxygen concentration entering
minus oxygen concentration leaving

379
00:22:40,963 --> 00:22:44,399
is equal to the rate of oxygen
consumption divided by the flow.

380
00:22:44,899 --> 00:22:48,656
This hardly changes, this increases,
this must be reduced

381
00:22:48,656 --> 00:22:52,055
this doesn't change,
so the oxygen concentration

382
00:22:52,055 --> 00:22:54,561
in the veins has to increase.

383
00:22:54,561 --> 00:22:57,024
And this, as we will see
in a few weeks,

384
00:22:57,024 --> 00:22:59,569
is a major biophysical basis

385
00:22:59,569 --> 00:23:01,870
of a major imaging technique

386
00:23:01,870 --> 00:23:05,285
to study brain function,
namely functional MRI.

387
00:23:07,078 --> 00:23:09,639
So, here I want
to bring in some definitions.

388
00:23:09,639 --> 00:23:11,696
We'll talk about the tracer.

389
00:23:12,256 --> 00:23:16,642
Classically a tracer
is a radioactive molecule.

390
00:23:16,642 --> 00:23:21,738
So it is emitting radioactivity,
it is labeled with the isotope.

391
00:23:22,678 --> 00:23:25,417
It is typically linked
to the molecule

392
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:31,160
that we wish to characterize
or sometimes even identical.

393
00:23:31,165 --> 00:23:35,361
So the natural substance
is called tracee here.

394
00:23:35,361 --> 00:23:37,739
And that would be...
one example we've already seen--

395
00:23:37,739 --> 00:23:40,158
that's glucose, that's the tracee,
and the tracer

396
00:23:40,158 --> 00:23:42,139
would be fluoro-deoxyglucose.

397
00:23:42,779 --> 00:23:45,751
But we can also have
the native molecule

398
00:23:45,751 --> 00:23:48,465
so that the tracer
is equal to the tracee

399
00:23:48,465 --> 00:23:53,803
and that would be oxygen,
the example of oxygen 15 PET.

400
00:23:53,803 --> 00:23:56,735
Now, the term tracer also implies
that the substance

401
00:23:56,735 --> 00:24:00,335
is administered in trace amounts.

402
00:24:00,335 --> 00:24:06,277
So that is very small compared
to the concentration of the tracee.

403
00:24:06,277 --> 00:24:09,752
So in the case of deoxyglucose
with PET, we can introduce

404
00:24:09,752 --> 00:24:13,241
very small amounts
of fluoro-deoxyglucose

405
00:24:14,311 --> 00:24:18,428
on the order of nanomols,
or micromols, micromolar,

406
00:24:18,428 --> 00:24:21,983
whereas the glucose concentration
is in the range of millimolar.

407
00:24:23,443 --> 00:24:26,003
And this has the advantage
that the introduction

408
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:29,330
of the image contrast
generating molecule

409
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,744
does not perturb the process
that we wish to measure.

410
00:24:34,663 --> 00:24:38,135
Now, we have the situation
that the tracer molecules,

411
00:24:38,135 --> 00:24:42,057
they're not all going
to contain the isotope.

412
00:24:42,057 --> 00:24:46,611
Some contain also the cold isotope,

413
00:24:46,611 --> 00:24:48,446
so they're not radioactive.

414
00:24:48,446 --> 00:24:53,540
And so what is important here
is to look at the specific activity,

415
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:57,970
and that is simply the ratio
of hot to cold tracer molecules.

416
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:02,139
Since the cold tracer molecules
are predominantly dominating

417
00:25:02,139 --> 00:25:06,268
the molecules, this gives us
a percentage of the molecules

418
00:25:06,268 --> 00:25:09,498
that are emitting radioactivity.

419
00:25:10,208 --> 00:25:13,232
This specific activity
is always measured.

420
00:25:13,522 --> 00:25:18,361
It's typically measured
in megaBecquerel per micromol

421
00:25:18,361 --> 00:25:20,742
or milliCuire per micromol.

422
00:25:20,742 --> 00:25:24,681
So it's given
in a per-concentration unit,

423
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:26,830
and we have to know it.

424
00:25:28,210 --> 00:25:34,310
So, the measured radioactivity 
is converted.

425
00:25:36,188 --> 00:25:38,715
The concentrations in the tissue
and in the blood

426
00:25:38,715 --> 00:25:40,255
are converted to mass units,

427
00:25:40,255 --> 00:25:43,695
so that we have
the correct physical units.

428
00:25:43,695 --> 00:25:45,766
In all the discussions
that we have today

429
00:25:45,766 --> 00:25:49,386
we are going to neglect physical decay,

430
00:25:49,386 --> 00:25:53,633
that is, we're going to assume
the natural half-life of f18

431
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:56,960
which is 110 minutes,
that we've taken this into account,

432
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:01,104
we've corrected for the fact
that without anything happening

433
00:26:01,104 --> 00:26:05,349
the signal intensity,
the specific activity

434
00:26:05,349 --> 00:26:09,762
will decrease 
with a half-life of 110 minutes.
