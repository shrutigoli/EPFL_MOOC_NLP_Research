1
00:00:04,474 --> 00:00:07,237
So to come back,
how does deoxyglucose

2
00:00:07,527 --> 00:00:09,475
measure glucose metabolism?

3
00:00:09,775 --> 00:00:13,913
And here, I want to stay specifically
with the term deoxyglucose

4
00:00:13,913 --> 00:00:17,250
because it's not just FDG PET
fluorodeoxyglucose,

5
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:22,304
it's 2-deoxyglucose paired with C11 label
that would be also a PET technique

6
00:00:22,304 --> 00:00:26,147
or C14, or H3 tritium.

7
00:00:26,147 --> 00:00:28,649
So it's the same process here.

8
00:00:28,649 --> 00:00:32,015
And the question is: how do we in the end
measure with deoxyglucose

9
00:00:32,015 --> 00:00:33,935
glucose metabolism?

10
00:00:34,965 --> 00:00:38,205
There is a problem here,
and I want to state this first.

11
00:00:38,205 --> 00:00:39,971
We have deoxyglucose
in the blood.

12
00:00:39,971 --> 00:00:41,723
That's our C_s *.

13
00:00:42,307 --> 00:00:45,161
This is what we can measure
by taking blood samples

14
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:48,464
and we can measure
the arterial input function

15
00:00:48,464 --> 00:00:50,724
like we just discussed,
so that we can measure.

16
00:00:51,357 --> 00:00:56,175
Then, two transport processes
describe the reaction constants K_1 and k_2.

17
00:00:56,595 --> 00:00:59,574
We have the uptake
of the free deoxyglucose

18
00:00:59,574 --> 00:01:04,016
that is, into the tissue,
that's tissue deoxyglucose.

19
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,528
And finally we have
the metabolic rate.

20
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:08,669
The metabolic rate
of glucose consumption

21
00:01:08,669 --> 00:01:13,101
that produces in the tissue
the deoxyglucose-6-phosphate.

22
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:17,966
And this is what we measure
with the imaging techniques, largely.

23
00:01:18,366 --> 00:01:22,476
With PET [inaudible] FDG.

24
00:01:22,476 --> 00:01:25,770
In our voxel measurement,
and this is, here,

25
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:30,173
the problem is this is what we are
essentially measuring.

26
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:32,564
So, what we don't want
to be able to measure

27
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:34,357
what we don't want to have
as a measurement

28
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:37,604
is the enrichment
of the deoxyglucose in the blood.

29
00:01:37,604 --> 00:01:40,292
We don't want that activity,
or the free deoxyglucose.

30
00:01:40,292 --> 00:01:45,889
We really just want to measure the buildup
of the deoxyglucose-6-phosphate.

31
00:01:45,889 --> 00:01:47,884
That's what is wanted.

32
00:01:49,775 --> 00:01:54,309
And so, in the measurement
principle of FGD PET

33
00:01:54,309 --> 00:01:57,380
this has to be taken into account,
and as you shall see

34
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,793
as we shall see,

35
00:01:58,793 --> 00:02:04,533
this actually has a specific consequence

36
00:02:04,533 --> 00:02:06,893
on how the scans are being performed.

37
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:10,448
So if look at over time,
we have the concentration

38
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:14,265
of the tracer on the y-axis,
time on the horizontal axis.

39
00:02:15,055 --> 00:02:17,745
Here's the concentration,
so it's some arbitrary units.

40
00:02:17,745 --> 00:02:21,434
And this is what is measured,
let's say, with the imaging technique.

41
00:02:21,434 --> 00:02:23,076
It's a blue curve.

42
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:25,058
And what we have
measured in the blood

43
00:02:25,058 --> 00:02:28,202
the arterial input function,
that is in red.

44
00:02:29,772 --> 00:02:32,436
One can take now, as I said,
with Laplace transform

45
00:02:32,436 --> 00:02:35,166
or other mathematical means
one can take now

46
00:02:35,166 --> 00:02:37,796
the differential equation
that we've established.

47
00:02:37,796 --> 00:02:40,919
We know the red curve,
we have measured the blue points

48
00:02:40,919 --> 00:02:43,916
and we can now fit our model.

49
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:46,987
Taking into account
the above transformations

50
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:52,997
one can fit this model
and obtain K_1, k_2 and k_3 to the data.

51
00:02:52,997 --> 00:02:54,925
This is fairly
mathematically involved

52
00:02:54,925 --> 00:02:58,244
and I want to show here
a simple approach

53
00:02:58,244 --> 00:03:02,015
which also illustrates
how we do the measurement.

54
00:03:02,405 --> 00:03:04,520
in practice.

55
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:07,287
So let's look at the free
deoxyglucose here

56
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:09,614
this pool here,
this compartment.

57
00:03:10,184 --> 00:03:13,109
This compartment, the buidup
so this is one reaction in,

58
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:16,478
two reactions going out,
this is the flow of the tracer in

59
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:22,229
K_1 times C_s *, that's the blood,
minus k_2 times C_3,

60
00:03:22,229 --> 00:03:25,223
the free deoxyglucose,
that's what's going

61
00:03:25,223 --> 00:03:28,829
by backward transfer,
out of the tissue,

62
00:03:28,829 --> 00:03:33,815
minus (k_3 times C_3),
that's the consumption rate

63
00:03:34,355 --> 00:03:37,962
of the free deoxyglucose.

64
00:03:38,849 --> 00:03:41,829
As to the tissue, in this model,
the way it's set up here

65
00:03:41,829 --> 00:03:45,065
we have the tissue radioactivity,
the deoxyglucose-6-phosphate

66
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:48,535
that's equal to k_3 times
the specific activity

67
00:03:48,535 --> 00:03:50,787
of the free deoxyglucose.

68
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:54,425
But we have no idea
of how this develops.

69
00:03:55,316 --> 00:03:57,671
We can solve
this differential equation here

70
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:01,136
if we know the free tissue
deoxyglucose concentration

71
00:04:01,136 --> 00:04:05,879
then the radioactivity in the tissue
is given times k_3 times the integral

72
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,937
of the free deoxyglucose
concentration over time.

73
00:04:10,647 --> 00:04:13,320
Now we can make here the assumption,
and for many tissues

74
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:16,640
this is a good assumption, that we have
fairly rapid glucose transport

75
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,598
so that is the specific activity
of free glucose in the tissue.

76
00:04:21,598 --> 00:04:26,921
Free deoxyglucose is pretty much
mimicking the specific activity

77
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:31,169
of the free deoxyglucose in the blood,
all of the deoxyglucose in the blood.

78
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:35,758
So we'll set here
the free deoxyglucose concentration

79
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:42,273
in the tissue equals to the concentration
that we have in the blood.

80
00:04:42,273 --> 00:04:44,108
The specific activity.

81
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:47,861
And then, we can take
this expression here,

82
00:04:47,861 --> 00:04:50,562
we can calculate k_3,
we'll have the integral

83
00:04:50,562 --> 00:04:53,510
of what's happening
in the blood from zero to big T.

84
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,674
The time integral 
times the concentration

85
00:04:57,374 --> 00:05:01,063
of the tissue radioactivity
at time big T.

86
00:05:01,063 --> 00:05:04,599
This gives us
the rate constant k_3.

87
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:10,795
And k_3 is essentially proportional
to the metabolic rate of glucose.

88
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:14,891
Actually, in reality,
the metabolic rate of glucose

89
00:05:14,891 --> 00:05:18,806
this is proportional, so here's the k_3,
that's this term here

90
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:25,553
is written as the blood
concentation of glucose

91
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:29,878
divided by a term
called lumped constant.

92
00:05:30,358 --> 00:05:33,465
This lumped constant is a term
that takes into account

93
00:05:33,465 --> 00:05:36,885
the difference in affinity
of deoxyglucose

94
00:05:36,885 --> 00:05:40,927
relative to glucose
for the process of transport

95
00:05:40,927 --> 00:05:45,226
and the metabolic rate,
so this is glucose transporters

96
00:05:45,226 --> 00:05:47,066
and hexokinase.

97
00:05:47,066 --> 00:05:49,727
C_s is the blood glucose
concentration here.

98
00:05:49,727 --> 00:05:53,086
So, this lumped constant
can be measured.

99
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:55,967
It is generally just assumed
to be a certain value

100
00:05:55,967 --> 00:06:00,070
and so we then have
the metabolic rate of glucose

101
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:03,727
is proportional to k_3,
and here's the proportionality constant.

102
00:06:05,001 --> 00:06:09,157
Just as a side point,
the unit of MR glucose

103
00:06:09,157 --> 00:06:13,648
is micromol of glucose molecules
per millimeter tissue per minute.

104
00:06:13,648 --> 00:06:16,939
Typically it's reported
as micromols per gram per minute,

105
00:06:16,939 --> 00:06:20,808
its equivalent, because
the specific weight, the density

106
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:26,278
of our soft tissues is essentially 1,
so it's 1 gram per milliliter

107
00:06:26,278 --> 00:06:28,008
so this is very close.

108
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:32,875
So, the metabolic rate of glucose
should be measured

109
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:37,012
when the tissue, specific activity
of free deoxyglucose

110
00:06:37,012 --> 00:06:38,512
is essentially negligible.

111
00:06:38,852 --> 00:06:40,143
Why is this so?

112
00:06:40,752 --> 00:06:43,092
Well, here we're coming
back to the problem.

113
00:06:43,092 --> 00:06:47,153
We, in the imaging technique,
even if this is zero, and this is not zero

114
00:06:48,283 --> 00:06:50,329
we will not be able
with the tracer techniques

115
00:06:50,329 --> 00:06:52,921
to distinguish between
these two pools.

116
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:55,513
We won't see the difference,
the radioactivity that we measure

117
00:06:55,513 --> 00:06:57,064
is independent of the chemistry,

118
00:06:57,064 --> 00:07:00,294
so we have this factor contributing.

119
00:07:00,294 --> 00:07:03,048
So ideally, we would want
to just measure that,

120
00:07:03,048 --> 00:07:06,079
so that's why we would
want to measure at a time point

121
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:11,380
where the tissue deoxyglucose
concentration is negligible.

122
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,637
And so, we're doing...
typically this experiment

123
00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:18,029
is typically done at around 45
to 60 minutes after the injection,

124
00:07:18,029 --> 00:07:22,262
bolus injection of the deoxyglucose
at this time point.

125
00:07:22,812 --> 00:07:25,762
So this is our big T here,
the measurement that we're doing

126
00:07:25,762 --> 00:07:28,888
so that's this term here,
that's what we've measured here

127
00:07:28,888 --> 00:07:31,047
and now we have
to evaluate this integral

128
00:07:31,047 --> 00:07:34,450
and that's just taking the integral
of the arterial input function.

129
00:07:34,450 --> 00:07:37,596
And there we go, voila,
we have the calculation

130
00:07:37,596 --> 00:07:42,848
of the metabolic rate of glucose
that can be done in this way.

131
00:07:42,848 --> 00:07:46,117
This explains that's when
the patient goes for a PET scan

132
00:07:46,117 --> 00:07:48,401
to measure the metabolic
rate of glucose

133
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,489
you have the uptake phase
so we will wait a certain amount of time

134
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,801
typically 45 to 60 minutes.

135
00:07:53,801 --> 00:07:56,042
This is to get the uptake
of the tracer

136
00:07:56,042 --> 00:08:00,572
into the tissue and to have minimal tracer

137
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:03,731
in the blood at that point
so that the image represents

138
00:08:03,731 --> 00:08:07,510
what's in the tissue
and not in the blood.

139
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,703
So how is a typical
FDG PET scan being performed?

140
00:08:13,113 --> 00:08:17,331
Well, first we need to produce
the FDG, this is done in a cyclotron.

141
00:08:17,751 --> 00:08:21,422
The production of F18,
then with radiochemistry

142
00:08:21,422 --> 00:08:23,630
it's attached
to a glucose molecule.

143
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:26,643
The person is placed
into the scanner.

144
00:08:26,643 --> 00:08:29,781
Here's the scanner,
and we obtain the image here.

145
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:33,151
This is a typical FDG scan,
high uptake in the heart

146
00:08:33,151 --> 00:08:36,391
in the brain up here,
and we have also

147
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:40,203
a lot of activity in the bladder
as it is being secreted

148
00:08:40,203 --> 00:08:42,224
by the urinary system.

149
00:08:42,646 --> 00:08:46,562
And here's an image
of a patient not so lucky

150
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:50,677
with metastases in the body,
and these metastases

151
00:08:50,677 --> 00:08:52,896
are clearly visible.

152
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:58,150
So, if we look at the uptake,
we have the uptake--

153
00:08:58,150 --> 00:09:00,001
the measurement
is done roughly here.

154
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:04,947
We have the metabolized FDG,
deoxyglucose-6-phosphate

155
00:09:04,947 --> 00:09:09,265
non-metabolized FDG
here in this model curve.

156
00:09:09,735 --> 00:09:13,088
So, we have the 45-minute
uptake phase,

157
00:09:13,088 --> 00:09:17,738
so we do the injection,
we wait 45 minutes,

158
00:09:17,738 --> 00:09:19,370
put the subject into the scanner

159
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,717
and then we measure
essentially the distribution

160
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:24,720
of fluoro-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate.

161
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,320
And this is here by plotting
the tissue concentration

162
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,119
to the plasma concentration,

163
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:33,429
and here, this is a reformulation
of the expression

164
00:09:33,429 --> 00:09:35,143
I showed on the previous slide.

165
00:09:35,143 --> 00:09:37,216
This linearizes
in these tac-tac plots

166
00:09:37,216 --> 00:09:41,544
linearizes the different times big T
the measurement

167
00:09:42,494 --> 00:09:46,860
and we can see here
that there is an increase

168
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:50,590
in tissue radioactivity in white matter
that is less than in grey matter

169
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,410
and that's a direct experimental
demonstration of higher metabolic rate

170
00:09:54,410 --> 00:09:56,850
of glucose here in the brain
for grey matter,

171
00:09:56,850 --> 00:10:00,524
grey matter being where the neurons are,
the electrical firing white matter

172
00:10:00,524 --> 00:10:02,961
the connections between the neurons.

173
00:10:03,911 --> 00:10:08,019
And so, if we look at the PET scan,
we get the raw values

174
00:10:08,369 --> 00:10:11,987
that are obtained with the modeling,
such as the modeling that's done here

175
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:17,407
or that I showed on the previous slide,
one can calculate in the end

176
00:10:17,407 --> 00:10:20,907
the local metabolic rate,
cerebral metabolic rate of glucose.

177
00:10:20,907 --> 00:10:25,685
This is the brain here, 
L stands for local,

178
00:10:25,685 --> 00:10:30,217
so this is basically a way of saying
that an image has been taken.

179
00:10:31,087 --> 00:10:35,706
If we look at the FDG scans of a rodent
this is a whole body scan

180
00:10:35,706 --> 00:10:41,147
and here is from the brain in red,
this is color coded in red

181
00:10:41,147 --> 00:10:46,314
shows high uptake
of the deoxyglucose

182
00:10:46,314 --> 00:10:48,089
and phosphorylation.

183
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:52,459
So, this is the essential principle here
for FDG PET scanning.

184
00:10:54,239 --> 00:10:59,889
I'll just briefly mention a few
other ways of using tracers

185
00:10:59,889 --> 00:11:03,840
with for example with PET
for gene imaging.

186
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:07,297
So here's a reporter gene
that interacts with a gene product

187
00:11:07,297 --> 00:11:09,481
and then you have a reported probe.

188
00:11:09,481 --> 00:11:14,657
So here's actually a CT contrast,
so this is iodine

189
00:11:14,657 --> 00:11:16,585
that is being transported.

190
00:11:17,015 --> 00:11:24,005
We have ligands with fluorinated ligands

191
00:11:24,005 --> 00:11:25,886
that bind to receptors.

192
00:11:26,386 --> 00:11:30,355
We have substrates

193
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,905
with fluorine contrast agents

194
00:11:35,755 --> 00:11:38,826
that are binding to these molecules.

195
00:11:38,826 --> 00:11:42,268
These are the reporter genes here,
the Herpes Simplex virus

196
00:11:43,368 --> 00:11:45,238
family of reporter genes.

197
00:11:45,238 --> 00:11:47,988
And so with the binding
of a specific ligand

198
00:11:47,988 --> 00:11:50,355
to that reporter gene,
that reports the activation

199
00:11:50,355 --> 00:11:54,134
of another gene,
gene expression can be imaged

200
00:11:55,374 --> 00:11:59,201
or the effect of therapy
can be measured.

201
00:12:00,051 --> 00:12:03,405
Let's look briefly at another example,
that's tumor metabolism

202
00:12:03,405 --> 00:12:04,515
and cell proliferation.

203
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:09,578
The two examples I want to give you
C11 Methionine and Fluoro-Ethyl-Tyrosine.

204
00:12:09,578 --> 00:12:12,760
So methionine
is a neutral amino-acid,

205
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:17,239
it's transported by the large
neutral amino-acid transporter molecule.

206
00:12:17,679 --> 00:12:21,199
With C11 it is measurable by PET,
enters the tissue,

207
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:25,375
and through protein synthesis,
is incorporated into proteins.

208
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:28,939
So this is a way to measure
protein synthesis.

209
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:34,149
So fluoro-ethyl-tyrosine
goes through the same transporter

210
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:37,967
and is then entered into the cell,
but because it is complex

211
00:12:37,967 --> 00:12:39,649
with fluoro-ethyl,

212
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,359
it's chemically modified,
it will, just like fluorodeoxyglucose

213
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:47,283
be stuck in the cells and stay.

214
00:12:47,283 --> 00:12:50,288
What we can image here is the uptake
of fluoro-ethyl-thyrosine

215
00:12:50,288 --> 00:12:54,288
and that's been found
to be a good marker of cell proliferation.
