1
00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:08,119
So now, how do we describe
these tracer kinetics?

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:12,181
That is, we're going to look at,
as I've introduced,

3
00:00:12,181 --> 00:00:16,207
I've already stated that we can use
first-order rate constants;

4
00:00:16,207 --> 00:00:18,483
I've introduced the concept of a tracer,

5
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:21,984
and so now we want to see
how these first-order tracer kinetics,

6
00:00:21,984 --> 00:00:24,171
how they can describe the process.

7
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:26,917
So let's start with a situation here,

8
00:00:26,917 --> 00:00:29,136
that's be this our organ,

9
00:00:29,136 --> 00:00:32,554
it is mimicked by a beaker,
full with a fluid.

10
00:00:33,081 --> 00:00:34,927
We have a supply tube.

11
00:00:35,311 --> 00:00:39,428
We have an exit tube,
that's our blood circulation.

12
00:00:40,045 --> 00:00:44,649
There is a certain flow going in,
and a certain flow going out.

13
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:48,245
The water paint level here
of this beaker does not change.

14
00:00:48,245 --> 00:00:50,287
The water content
of our tissue doesn't change,

15
00:00:50,287 --> 00:00:52,987
or the content of the substance
doesn't change.

16
00:00:53,377 --> 00:00:59,917
Then we will inject
our marked molecules, our tracer.

17
00:01:01,037 --> 00:01:04,098
The tracer can be also--
you can think of it as colored molecules.

18
00:01:04,098 --> 00:01:05,598
You can think of it as a dye.

19
00:01:05,598 --> 00:01:09,255
You can think of this as a little river;
this is a little lake;

20
00:01:09,255 --> 00:01:11,359
and this is the river,
downstream from the lake,

21
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:13,292
and you inject some water dye,

22
00:01:13,292 --> 00:01:15,443
and what we're measuring with imaging

23
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:18,229
is what's happening
to the color of the lake.

24
00:01:18,229 --> 00:01:21,002
And believe it or not, this is
what environmental engineers do

25
00:01:21,002 --> 00:01:24,219
to understand, for example, lake dynamics,

26
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,977
so it's the same principle there.

27
00:01:26,733 --> 00:01:29,714
So what we'll do with the experiment
is we'll infuse a tracer

28
00:01:29,714 --> 00:01:33,224
with concentration, C_s *,

29
00:01:33,224 --> 00:01:34,996
"*" means it's radioactive,

30
00:01:34,996 --> 00:01:39,774
"C" is the concentration,
and "s" here is subscript for "substrate."

31
00:01:39,774 --> 00:01:41,297
That's our substrate.

32
00:01:41,980 --> 00:01:46,949
We measure from our beaker here,
we measure the sample,

33
00:01:46,949 --> 00:01:49,293
and there we measure
the tracer enrichment,

34
00:01:49,293 --> 00:01:51,955
or the specific activity in the tissue.

35
00:01:51,955 --> 00:01:54,222
Here "C" is, again, for the concentration,

36
00:01:54,222 --> 00:01:57,209
"T" for tissue,
and "*" means the radioactivity.

37
00:01:57,888 --> 00:01:59,959
In the case of a lake,
this means taking samples,

38
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,152
doing the measurement there.

39
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:04,293
In the case of our imaging techniques,
this means taking an image

40
00:02:04,293 --> 00:02:07,851
and measuring the radioactivity spatially,

41
00:02:07,851 --> 00:02:11,665
using the imaging techniques
that we've discussed the last two weeks.

42
00:02:12,463 --> 00:02:16,498
Now, let's look out when we have
a unidirectional chemical reaction

43
00:02:16,498 --> 00:02:19,633
from substrate to product "T",

44
00:02:19,633 --> 00:02:22,146
so we have the concentration
of the substrate,

45
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:24,157
we have the concentration of the product,

46
00:02:24,157 --> 00:02:27,001
and we have a unidirectional reaction.

47
00:02:27,001 --> 00:02:30,157
This means we can only proceed
in one direction.

48
00:02:30,157 --> 00:02:34,891
And hexokinase is a very good example
of such a metabolic system.

49
00:02:35,754 --> 00:02:38,337
The product, then,
is being metabolized further

50
00:02:38,337 --> 00:02:40,905
by another reaction,
and we describe it here

51
00:02:40,905 --> 00:02:43,827
with a reaction called [Synth] k_3.

52
00:02:44,421 --> 00:02:50,027
So what we are measuring is--

53
00:02:50,027 --> 00:02:51,953
this is our compartment here;

54
00:02:51,953 --> 00:02:54,490
this is the measurement,
the tissue reactivity;

55
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,047
and now we'll look
at a first-order process

56
00:02:57,047 --> 00:02:58,929
that converts S into T,

57
00:02:59,489 --> 00:03:02,836
and we'll look
at the reaction velocity here.

58
00:03:03,710 --> 00:03:08,432
Now, reaction velocity is
concentrations per mass per time,

59
00:03:08,432 --> 00:03:11,186
so it's micromoles per gram per minute.

60
00:03:11,476 --> 00:03:13,615
And now the reaction velocity is equal

61
00:03:13,615 --> 00:03:15,708
to the rate of change in concentration

62
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:19,908
of the molecule in the tissue, C_T,

63
00:03:20,528 --> 00:03:23,627
and this is now given by,
with first-order kinetics,

64
00:03:23,627 --> 00:03:28,604
is given by K_1 times
the concentration of the substrate,

65
00:03:28,904 --> 00:03:32,410
minus k_3 times the concentration
of the product.

66
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:36,973
Here we have used the expression
that the rate constant equals

67
00:03:36,973 --> 00:03:41,753
to the reaction velocity divided
by the concentration,

68
00:03:41,753 --> 00:03:43,633
so if we put that back in here,

69
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:49,130
then we can see this term
is equal to V in, the velocity in,

70
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,154
and this is equal to the velocity out,
reaction velocity V out.

71
00:03:57,039 --> 00:04:03,092
So K_1 and k_3, in this context,
they are the first-order rate constants.

72
00:04:03,497 --> 00:04:06,723
They are not true constants
because they mimic the situation

73
00:04:06,723 --> 00:04:09,132
of the system in a particular state,

74
00:04:09,132 --> 00:04:11,147
they're not really
true reaction constants.

75
00:04:11,147 --> 00:04:14,121
That's why one also often refers to them

76
00:04:14,121 --> 00:04:16,956
as pseudo first-order rate constants.

77
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:19,110
For our experiment now we'll assume

78
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,677
that they are independent
of concentration and time.

79
00:04:22,677 --> 00:04:27,171
The reaction constants have--
the unit typically is used per minute,

80
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:29,656
but it can also be per second.

81
00:04:31,575 --> 00:04:36,832
So this is, if we have
more molecules entering than leaving,

82
00:04:36,832 --> 00:04:42,324
we'll have buildup of the product here,
and this will increase.

83
00:04:42,324 --> 00:04:46,857
If we have less molecules entering
than leaving this system here,

84
00:04:46,857 --> 00:04:51,873
we have a reduction of the concentration
of this tissue component.

85
00:04:52,738 --> 00:04:56,723
Now let's look at what's happening
if we are supplying,

86
00:04:56,723 --> 00:05:00,891
in the substrate C_s,
we are supplying radioactive molecules.

87
00:05:01,572 --> 00:05:06,728
And now we're interested in understanding
how the rate of labeled molecules

88
00:05:06,728 --> 00:05:11,235
that enters the tissue pool,
C_T, is calculated.

89
00:05:11,684 --> 00:05:18,613
Now the rate of radioactive
molecules here in C_T--

90
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:21,735
just to be sure, it does not
have to be radioactive,

91
00:05:21,735 --> 00:05:25,628
but we'll just call the term radioactive,
or labeled molecules here,

92
00:05:25,628 --> 00:05:27,480
is equal to the metabolic flux;

93
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,474
that is, the flux of the number
of molecules per unit

94
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:34,820
entering here into this pool,
times the probability

95
00:05:34,820 --> 00:05:38,218
that one of those molecules
is actually labeled.

96
00:05:39,492 --> 00:05:43,804
So what this means is we're saying
we'll take this term, here.

97
00:05:44,348 --> 00:05:48,905
We have the rate of labeled molecules
that appear here is equal

98
00:05:48,905 --> 00:05:53,084
to the reaction velocity
times the probability they are labeled.

99
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:59,588
This is the number
of labeled molecules, C_s *,

100
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:01,594
divided by the total number of molecules.

101
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,241
That's the probability
that they're labeled,

102
00:06:05,203 --> 00:06:09,512
that is gives us the rate
of molecules entering C_T,

103
00:06:09,512 --> 00:06:14,060
and if we [plug] this in here,
with this definition here we'll find

104
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:19,385
that this is equal to K_1 times
the concentration of labeled molecules,

105
00:06:19,385 --> 00:06:21,937
in the substrate here, C_s.

106
00:06:23,195 --> 00:06:26,842
So, to give you an example here,
we have a hypothetical situation.

107
00:06:27,142 --> 00:06:28,984
We have ten molecules,

108
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:33,087
and now we'll say okay,
these molecules are being supplied

109
00:06:33,087 --> 00:06:35,849
at a rate of ten molecules per minute.

110
00:06:35,849 --> 00:06:39,305
That's just an arbitrary number,
to give us something

111
00:06:39,305 --> 00:06:42,285
we can easily calculate
and we can visualize.

112
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:45,190
So let's say we have
ten molecules per minute

113
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,026
that are being supplied,
and now the question is

114
00:06:48,026 --> 00:06:53,968
how many of those
are going to be producing,

115
00:06:53,968 --> 00:06:57,421
in the tissue here, the concentration,

116
00:06:57,421 --> 00:07:00,983
what is the rate of red molecules
that are being produced,

117
00:07:00,983 --> 00:07:05,578
assuming that we are supplying,
here, on this side,

118
00:07:05,578 --> 00:07:07,893
we're supplying a total of ten molecules?

119
00:07:07,893 --> 00:07:11,260
So how many molecules,
if you have ten molecules coming here,

120
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,743
how many red molecules
are being produced here?

121
00:07:13,743 --> 00:07:17,155
Let's talk about the first situation--
we have no red molecules entering.

122
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:21,328
Then the rate of product
that is being produced is zero.

123
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:25,373
Now, you can use here <i>red</i>
as a synonym for <i>labeled,</i>

124
00:07:25,373 --> 00:07:28,674
just to give an idea,
and one of the problems

125
00:07:28,674 --> 00:07:32,948
that we have put together is a situation

126
00:07:32,948 --> 00:07:36,723
with colored cars between two cities.

127
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:42,870
So the question is, what is the rate
of buildup of labeled molecules?

128
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:47,179
So we're going to have
to look here in the calculation,

129
00:07:47,179 --> 00:07:50,653
we're going to have the reaction velocity,
which is ten per minute,

130
00:07:50,653 --> 00:07:56,061
times the probability of a molecule
being labeled, being red.

131
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,175
So if we have one out of ten,

132
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:03,275
what is the rate of red molecules

133
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:07,931
appearing in this pool?
How many molecules per minute?

134
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:10,439
Well, we have ten that are coming in.

135
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:14,181
One of the ten is red,
so we'll have one per minute

136
00:08:14,181 --> 00:08:18,315
that is being synthesized,
labeled molecules.

137
00:08:18,315 --> 00:08:20,365
If we have two, then we have--

138
00:08:20,365 --> 00:08:24,852
again, the velocity is
ten molecules per minute--

139
00:08:24,852 --> 00:08:26,619
we have two out of the ten,

140
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:28,999
so it's 1 over 5 molecules,

141
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:31,999
20%, that are red,

142
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:37,511
and so the rate of labeled molecules
that enters into the tissue pool

143
00:08:37,511 --> 00:08:39,265
is now two.

144
00:08:40,305 --> 00:08:42,674
And that's the last example here,
so if we have three,

145
00:08:42,674 --> 00:08:47,537
then we have three red molecules entering,

146
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,278
we have ten total,
30% of them are labeled,

147
00:08:51,278 --> 00:08:55,689
so we have three molecules per minute
that enter into our pool.

148
00:08:56,258 --> 00:09:00,611
So I hope this example gives you
an idea of how to understand

149
00:09:00,611 --> 00:09:02,001
how we calculate

150
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,529
the buildup of tissue radioactivity--

151
00:09:07,529 --> 00:09:09,531
it's velocity times probability.

152
00:09:09,531 --> 00:09:12,492
This turns out to be,
with this definition, to be the rate,

153
00:09:12,492 --> 00:09:13,980
the pseudo first-order rate constant,

154
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:17,778
times the concentration
of the substrate radioactivity.

155
00:09:18,745 --> 00:09:23,087
Now what happens if we keep supplying
labeled molecules?

156
00:09:23,087 --> 00:09:26,743
We obviously will increase
the percentage of these molecules

157
00:09:26,743 --> 00:09:28,999
that are labeled, that are red,

158
00:09:28,999 --> 00:09:31,163
and at some point,
they will no longer change.

159
00:09:31,623 --> 00:09:34,523
And at some point we'll have
a significant number of red molecules

160
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:38,298
that leave this pool,
so we need to add this efflux,

161
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:42,115
this reaction rate, to the calculations.

162
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,549
Now, what is the percentage
of red molecules

163
00:09:44,549 --> 00:09:46,596
that are leaving this pool here?

164
00:09:46,596 --> 00:09:49,270
It's equal to the metabolic flux
times the probability

165
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,413
of this molecule being labeled,

166
00:09:51,413 --> 00:09:55,746
so it's the flux, here, this is the flux,
times this term here,

167
00:09:55,746 --> 00:09:58,997
now we just put C_T * over C_T,

168
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:03,860
and so we get here
by taking this, plus this,

169
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,439
applied to this pool,

170
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,720
we're now obtaining the efflux term,

171
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:13,337
and that's -k_3 times the tissue activity

172
00:10:13,337 --> 00:10:16,100
of the tissue pool, as a function of time.

173
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:21,107
And this is essentially the system
of a linear differential equation

174
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:25,329
that describes the rate of change
of labeled molecules

175
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:27,394
appearing in the tissue pool

176
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:31,475
as a function of the radioactivity
of the tracer

177
00:10:31,475 --> 00:10:34,487
in the substrate that is the blood pool.

178
00:10:36,037 --> 00:10:38,455
So now the question is
how do we describe

179
00:10:38,455 --> 00:10:42,304
this one-tissue compartment model?
What are some of the features?

180
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:46,130
I'll recap here the model.
We have the substrate.

181
00:10:46,130 --> 00:10:48,580
We have the influx reaction

182
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:51,075
that's describing
the reaction constant K_1.

183
00:10:51,075 --> 00:10:55,381
We have the efflux reaction
describing the reaction constant k_3.

184
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:58,229
We have the two concentrations
in the tissue pool.

185
00:10:58,229 --> 00:11:01,643
And we just established
the equation that describes

186
00:11:01,643 --> 00:11:06,024
the rate of change
in labeled molecules in the tissue

187
00:11:06,024 --> 00:11:10,526
as a function of the change
in labeled molecules in a substrate,

188
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:13,508
for example, in the blood
or the precursor.

189
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:17,048
So this is a linear differential equation.

190
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:23,948
It's a linear first-order
ordinary differential equation,

191
00:11:23,948 --> 00:11:28,947
and this can be solved mathematically
by using the Laplace transformation.

192
00:11:29,379 --> 00:11:33,339
The solution, then, is given
by the tissue radioactivity,

193
00:11:34,118 --> 00:11:39,091
the tracer in the tissue is equal
to K_1 times the precursor,

194
00:11:39,091 --> 00:11:41,182
the C_s * here,

195
00:11:41,182 --> 00:11:45,561
or the function of time
convoluted with e to the -k_3 T.

196
00:11:46,681 --> 00:11:50,064
Mathematically, the convolution
is this mathematical operation,

197
00:11:50,064 --> 00:11:55,552
and so this is, in principal,
the solution that we can obtain,

198
00:11:55,552 --> 00:11:56,870
so mathematic.

199
00:11:56,870 --> 00:12:01,449
Now the Laplace transformation
is not a very easy--

200
00:12:01,449 --> 00:12:04,676
algorithmically,
it's not very easy to handle.

201
00:12:04,676 --> 00:12:08,504
It is not very intuitive,

202
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:12,037
and actually, in practice,
it is hardly being used,

203
00:12:12,037 --> 00:12:14,408
although this is, strictly speaking,

204
00:12:14,408 --> 00:12:18,550
the mathematically strict solution.

205
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:23,562
So instead I want to illustrate
a simple example first.

206
00:12:23,562 --> 00:12:27,103
This example is very simple,
because it also makes us understand

207
00:12:27,103 --> 00:12:30,074
a few important features.

208
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,824
So we'll take this example,
and we'll assume

209
00:12:32,824 --> 00:12:37,125
that we have done an experiment
where we raised the activity,

210
00:12:37,125 --> 00:12:40,843
the tracer concentration,
in the blood or the precursor,

211
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:44,687
at time zero, from zero to a value alpha.

212
00:12:44,687 --> 00:12:47,538
We'll call it alpha. 
We can call it anything that we want.

213
00:12:47,538 --> 00:12:51,036
So, if we look
at the concentration of C_s *,

214
00:12:51,036 --> 00:12:53,763
the labeled molecules,
the tracer, at time zero,

215
00:12:53,763 --> 00:12:56,103
it goes from zero to alpha,
and then [inaudible].

216
00:12:56,103 --> 00:12:58,120
And then we assume it is constant.

217
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,916
Now this is a very simple situation.

218
00:13:01,465 --> 00:13:03,758
Now we can write the above equation here,

219
00:13:03,758 --> 00:13:07,541
so we'll [inaudible] for this situation.
We'll write the equation, and we'll see,

220
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:11,033
at times zero or higher, what is happening

221
00:13:11,033 --> 00:13:15,988
is that the tissue concentration
of the substrate of the tracer

222
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,952
is equal to K_1 times alpha, because then
we have set now this concentration

223
00:13:19,952 --> 00:13:25,911
to constant minus k_3 times
the tissue concentration of the tracer.

224
00:13:27,344 --> 00:13:31,211
And this is something we can
mathematically handle ourselves.

225
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:34,624
So on the left side
we've got a variable, C_T*,

226
00:13:34,624 --> 00:13:36,386
that is the time derivative;

227
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:38,792
and on the right side
we've got the same variable,

228
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:42,081
and typically when we have
the derivative on one side of a function,

229
00:13:42,081 --> 00:13:45,314
and the function on the other side,
well, this basically means

230
00:13:45,314 --> 00:13:48,265
we're looking at something
where the derivative of the function

231
00:13:48,265 --> 00:13:51,113
is equal to the function
times some constant,

232
00:13:51,113 --> 00:13:54,646
and the solution here involves, therefore,

233
00:13:54,646 --> 00:13:57,512
the exponent e to the minus something.

234
00:13:58,058 --> 00:13:59,928
And one can do the Ansatz--

235
00:13:59,928 --> 00:14:01,812
I won't go into
the mathematical details here,

236
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:04,646
and I'll just give you the solution here.

237
00:14:04,646 --> 00:14:08,255
So, and this you can verify by plugging
this expression that we have here

238
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:10,916
into this differential equation,
and solving and verifying

239
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,717
that this is indeed
a proper mathematical solution.

240
00:14:15,232 --> 00:14:17,960
Now, what does this imply?

241
00:14:18,355 --> 00:14:19,754
Well, if we take this function,

242
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:21,547
and we have on the right the time zero,

243
00:14:21,547 --> 00:14:24,275
so we set T to zero,
this term becomes zero,

244
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:27,311
then the tissue radioactivity
at time zero is zero.

245
00:14:27,311 --> 00:14:30,364
That makes sense, because we have said
we start out with nothing,

246
00:14:30,364 --> 00:14:33,094
so there's nothing in the tissue,
and at time zero we jump

247
00:14:33,094 --> 00:14:36,055
to alpha in the precursor--
that's this term here.

248
00:14:37,048 --> 00:14:41,414
Now, what's happening at time infinity,
the tissue radioactivity will,

249
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:46,782
exponentially, approach
a constant value, K_1 alpha over k_3,

250
00:14:46,782 --> 00:14:51,174
so we're getting an exponential increase,
[or developed from your side],

251
00:14:51,174 --> 00:14:55,925
an exponential increase
to a plateau level with time.

252
00:14:57,549 --> 00:14:59,801
So, I have schematically drawn this here.

253
00:14:59,801 --> 00:15:04,116
We have time on the x-axis,
the tracer arrangement on the y-axis,

254
00:15:04,116 --> 00:15:08,329
and what we'll see, this function
as an exponential increase with time.

255
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:12,121
And we're getting the plateau enrichment.

256
00:15:13,256 --> 00:15:17,392
Or, to illustrate this here,
we have an injection of a tracer,

257
00:15:17,392 --> 00:15:20,779
this is an illustration
from a brain experiment,

258
00:15:20,779 --> 00:15:27,068
and the brain will change color
as the tracer is appearing in the tissue,

259
00:15:27,068 --> 00:15:30,452
and labels the tissue concentration.

260
00:15:31,387 --> 00:15:35,452
Now, conceptually, what we need
to get our metabolic rate,

261
00:15:36,236 --> 00:15:38,117
this is described by the parameter k_3,

262
00:15:38,117 --> 00:15:41,838
so we need to determine
this parameter, k_3, here.

263
00:15:43,283 --> 00:15:46,040
And we might think that,
for such a simple function,

264
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:47,944
an exponentially increasing function,

265
00:15:47,944 --> 00:15:51,284
e to the minus asymptotically going 
to a steady state value,

266
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:54,648
but this, mathematically, is very simple.

267
00:15:55,155 --> 00:15:58,545
It actually turns out
this is not as simple in practice,

268
00:15:58,545 --> 00:16:03,625
and there are...
one has to be a bit cautious here.

269
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:08,782
For one thing, to determine
this time constant, one needs to know

270
00:16:08,782 --> 00:16:12,057
when the plateau enrichment is achieved.

271
00:16:13,108 --> 00:16:15,317
If we don't measure
to the plateau enrichment,

272
00:16:15,317 --> 00:16:17,749
we don't have a good idea
what a plateau enrichment is,

273
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:24,021
and so this constant, k_3, is actually
practically not very well determined.

274
00:16:25,239 --> 00:16:29,353
So it depends, strongly, on whether
we know what this steady level is,

275
00:16:29,353 --> 00:16:32,447
so that we can estimate,
from the fitting process,

276
00:16:32,967 --> 00:16:36,086
the rate at which
the enrichment is achieved.

277
00:16:36,086 --> 00:16:38,392
If we have a fast metabolic rate,
it happens like this;

278
00:16:38,392 --> 00:16:41,176
if we have a slow metabolic rate,
it happens like that,

279
00:16:41,176 --> 00:16:45,055
but to get a fairly precise estimate,
we need to have a good idea

280
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,437
on the plateau enrichment,
and this is, essentially,

281
00:16:47,437 --> 00:16:50,671
to any function that has this form

282
00:16:50,671 --> 00:16:56,059
is a mathematical feature there,
that we have.

283
00:16:57,087 --> 00:16:59,846
This term, the steady state enrichment,

284
00:16:59,846 --> 00:17:02,885
and this term, the rate at which
it achieves its steady state,

285
00:17:02,885 --> 00:17:06,917
mathematically, when you fit this
to the time course, they are correlated,

286
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:11,581
typically, with very negative
correlation coefficients,

287
00:17:11,581 --> 00:17:15,286
so this is one of the difficulties,
and we'll be seeing more

288
00:17:15,286 --> 00:17:20,028
of these equations
in the second course on MRI.

289
00:17:21,305 --> 00:17:25,836
The measurement of metabolic rates
depends on our knowledge

290
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:29,314
of what's happening in the substrates,
in the precursor pool, C_s,

291
00:17:29,654 --> 00:17:31,729
relative to the tissue pool,

292
00:17:31,729 --> 00:17:34,255
and we have just worked
with a simple example

293
00:17:34,255 --> 00:17:36,252
where what is happening in the blood

294
00:17:36,252 --> 00:17:38,559
was assumed to be a state function,

295
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:41,621
but let's now look
at what is this input function,

296
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:45,397
what's happening in the blood in reality.

297
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:49,270
So we'll take an example,
of a practical example--

298
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:54,059
We'll infuse the tracer with a so-called
<i>intravenous bolus infusion</i>.

299
00:17:54,059 --> 00:17:56,231
This basically means
we'll take the syringe,

300
00:17:56,231 --> 00:17:58,942
we'll inject the tracer
into the bloodstream

301
00:17:58,942 --> 00:18:03,146
in a relatively short time,
that's what the bolus means,

302
00:18:03,146 --> 00:18:05,136
intravenous, obviously, into the veins,

303
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:08,557
so it's a very fast application.

304
00:18:09,107 --> 00:18:12,519
So, the tracer goes into the vasculature

305
00:18:12,519 --> 00:18:15,580
in a short time, as a bolus.

306
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:19,993
Yes, and this does involve needles,
so if you're queasy about needles,

307
00:18:19,993 --> 00:18:24,376
this is not the technique
you want to expose yourself to.

308
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:28,689
Then, what happens is this tracer
that goes in in a very short time,

309
00:18:28,689 --> 00:18:33,434
we'll assume it's very short,
undergoes mixing in the circulation.

310
00:18:35,684 --> 00:18:37,609
We'll assume here
it's well mixed with the blood,

311
00:18:37,609 --> 00:18:39,656
so this involves the heart,

312
00:18:40,796 --> 00:18:45,351
then the substance
can undergo exchange with, say,

313
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:50,805
interstitial spaces
or even intracellular volume,

314
00:18:50,805 --> 00:18:53,886
so this happens in the circulation.

315
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:58,873
And as a result of this process,

316
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:02,592
instead of getting a bolus
where the tracer appears--

317
00:19:02,592 --> 00:19:05,017
it's very high for a short time,
and then again zero--

318
00:19:05,017 --> 00:19:08,059
what we'll see in the blood
is a rapid rise of the tracer,

319
00:19:08,059 --> 00:19:12,385
and then sort of a relatively
slow decay, sort of dispersion,

320
00:19:12,385 --> 00:19:16,408
due to these mixing processes,
and that's what is then measured.

321
00:19:16,408 --> 00:19:21,906
Typically in the artery
it's the measurement of the tracer

322
00:19:21,906 --> 00:19:24,847
in the arterial plasma,
and this is what we call

323
00:19:24,847 --> 00:19:28,552
the arterial input function, or C_s *.

324
00:19:29,741 --> 00:19:32,553
So if you look at the tracer
in arterial blood,

325
00:19:32,553 --> 00:19:35,959
this is a typical tracer here,

326
00:19:35,959 --> 00:19:41,145
concentration, this is in decays
per second per milliliter

327
00:19:41,145 --> 00:19:43,789
or kilobecquerel per milliliter over time,

328
00:19:43,789 --> 00:19:45,987
so we have the rapid injection;
we get the bolus,

329
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:48,951
and then a relatively rapid reduction.

330
00:19:49,722 --> 00:19:52,455
What then happens,
as a second step,

331
00:19:52,455 --> 00:19:55,995
is that the tracer's distributed
to the capillary bed,

332
00:19:55,995 --> 00:19:59,367
and then undergoes exchange
with the tissue.

333
00:20:01,099 --> 00:20:05,227
So, the uptake into the tissue
in moles per fusion,

334
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:09,003
moles' permeability
of the endothelium,

335
00:20:09,003 --> 00:20:13,295
it involves the blood volume as a factor,

336
00:20:14,211 --> 00:20:16,886
it involves transport
across cell membranes,

337
00:20:16,886 --> 00:20:20,228
possibly specific binding to receptors,

338
00:20:21,525 --> 00:20:25,196
or non-specific binding,
or enzyme activity.

339
00:20:25,196 --> 00:20:28,378
So these are all factors
that influence the ultimate uptake

340
00:20:28,378 --> 00:20:31,018
of the tracer in the tissue.

341
00:20:32,343 --> 00:20:35,138
So, as we have given our bolus here,

342
00:20:35,138 --> 00:20:38,470
we're getting a sudden increase in tracer,

343
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,694
we're also getting
a concentration increase

344
00:20:40,694 --> 00:20:43,553
in tracer in the tissue,

345
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:46,027
due to extraction from the blood.

346
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,967
And if we now look at the output--

347
00:20:48,967 --> 00:20:52,563
so this is the tissue radioactivity here,

348
00:20:52,563 --> 00:20:55,094
we have the concentration
in the tissue on the y-axis,

349
00:20:55,094 --> 00:20:59,481
the time on the x-axis--
then this is what we are seeing,

350
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:02,932
the concentration that we can measure
with the imaging techniques,

351
00:21:02,932 --> 00:21:04,669
that's the black line here.

352
00:21:05,103 --> 00:21:08,537
This particular graph here is a simulation
of a metabolic process,

353
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:10,563
where multiple compounds are involved;

354
00:21:10,563 --> 00:21:13,500
the red and green are just
some intermediate.

355
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,130
Other compounds that contribute
to the overall tissue-rate activity,

356
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:19,699
since we cannot distinguish
chemical species

357
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:23,282
based on their x-ray activity alone.

358
00:21:24,215 --> 00:21:27,887
We have of course this tracer,
it's not going to stay in the tissue.

359
00:21:27,887 --> 00:21:32,510
There is backward transfer--
We take, for example, oxygen.

360
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:37,010
If you have oxygen, you breathe oxygen,
it's converted to H₂O¹⁵,

361
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:40,835
and this H₂O obviously then
at some point leaves the tissue again,

362
00:21:40,835 --> 00:21:44,473
and for glucose, if you take up glucose,

363
00:21:44,473 --> 00:21:47,056
you look at C11-glucose, for example.

364
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:51,261
This will ultimately leave the tissue
in the form of CO₂,

365
00:21:51,261 --> 00:21:53,465
C11 labeled CO₂,

366
00:21:53,465 --> 00:21:58,096
so the backward transfer
can be in the same species,

367
00:21:58,096 --> 00:22:00,407
or can be a different chemical species,

368
00:22:00,407 --> 00:22:02,866
but this, ultimately,
reduces the concentration

369
00:22:02,866 --> 00:22:05,248
of the tracer in the tissue.
