00:00:04,795 --> 00:00:09,035
This week we are going to discuss
an application of magnetic resonance

2
00:00:10,195 --> 00:00:13,405
that is dear to chemists 
and biochemists alike,

3
00:00:13,415 --> 00:00:17,645
but also has some applications 
in biomedical imaging.

4
00:00:18,461 --> 00:00:20,781
And I want first to start out 
with some of examples

5
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:28,881
on the distinction of the 
magnetic resonance signal

6
00:00:28,881 --> 00:00:31,371
based on its chemical environment.

7
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:33,120
And the prominent example

8
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,670
of magnetic resonance imaging 
here is fat and water.

9
00:00:37,554 --> 00:00:42,584
So, if we take an image of the brain--
here are the eyeballs,

10
00:00:42,584 --> 00:00:46,084
this is a transversal cut,
here is the midline--

11
00:00:46,564 --> 00:00:49,734
this is a typical <i>T_1</i> waited image here.

12
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,420
And then here the same image 
has been repeated,

13
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:54,510
but through some manipulations

14
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,130
the signal that arises from the fat
has been eliminated,

15
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:00,030
and we will discuss 
how this is being done.

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,180
So we see the subcutaneous fat is gone.

17
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:06,700
We also see that the signal 
behind the eyeballs here is eliminated.

18
00:01:06,703 --> 00:01:09,611
And this is due to the fact 
that behind our eyeballs

19
00:01:09,611 --> 00:01:12,171
we have the so called retrobulbar fat.

20
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:19,431
So, in this image one has been able 
to eliminate the source of signal

21
00:01:19,431 --> 00:01:23,391
due to fat taking particular property.

22
00:01:23,394 --> 00:01:27,518
And so this bright region here, 
which could potentially be a tumor,

23
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:31,746
is established here 
as containing a lot of fat

24
00:01:31,746 --> 00:01:35,146
and is most likely a lipoma.

25
00:01:36,107 --> 00:01:39,247
So, if you look at the body, 
then we have the original image,

26
00:01:39,247 --> 00:01:42,707
which is everything included, 
then one can generate an image

27
00:01:42,707 --> 00:01:46,347
that has only the the fat signal--
we see the fat signal here on the surface,

28
00:01:46,728 --> 00:01:49,908
this fat here or just 
the water-only signal.

29
00:01:50,668 --> 00:01:53,428
Or here, another example--
somebody who carries more fat.

30
00:01:53,682 --> 00:01:58,048
There is more fat here in this image, 
as illustrated here in the fat-only image

31
00:01:58,048 --> 00:01:59,618
and in the water-only image.

32
00:02:00,228 --> 00:02:05,618
The area which is rich in fat 
is not so intense.

33
00:02:06,988 --> 00:02:09,538
Here is another example--
this is MRI of the breast.

34
00:02:10,211 --> 00:02:14,683
We have a normal MRI of the breast here--
very bright images

35
00:02:14,683 --> 00:02:17,346
and then to distinguish

36
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:20,686
between potential cancer tissue 
and fat signal

37
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:23,866
which both would give up 
in this type of images bright signal--

38
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:27,346
the signal here was acquired 
with suppressing the signal from the fat.

39
00:02:27,346 --> 00:02:32,706
One sees a bright signal here, 
which is a potential cancerous lesion.

40
00:02:33,076 --> 00:02:34,522
Here is important to know

41
00:02:34,522 --> 00:02:37,892
that cancer typically 
does not contain a lot of fat signal.

42
00:02:38,662 --> 00:02:40,702
Here is an example from fatty liver.

43
00:02:41,492 --> 00:02:44,292
This is an area taken here from the liver,

44
00:02:44,584 --> 00:02:46,874
and one looks now at signal--

45
00:02:46,874 --> 00:02:50,614
the water in these different cases 
of fatty liver is constant,

46
00:02:50,614 --> 00:02:54,448
and here on the side this extra peak here

47
00:02:54,448 --> 00:02:58,958
goes from mild to moderate 
to severe fatty liver.

48
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:02,494
So this is an example 
of the way the data is analyzed

49
00:03:02,494 --> 00:03:05,914
to obtain biochemical information in vivo.

50
00:03:08,214 --> 00:03:10,614
So, why is NMR spectroscopy

51
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:14,304
so important 
for chemists and biochemists alike?

52
00:03:15,574 --> 00:03:18,214
It is actually so important 
that essentially any department

53
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:22,004
of biochemistry or chemistry 
does have its NMR equipment.

54
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:26,558
And the reason here is, 
it is a routine tool.

55
00:03:26,558 --> 00:03:30,848
It allows non-destructive 
analysis of samples.

56
00:03:31,983 --> 00:03:36,453
A more amusing example is 
to analyze the quality of wine in bottles.

57
00:03:36,453 --> 00:03:39,374
If you have an expensive wine,
but you want to have quality assurance

58
00:03:39,374 --> 00:03:41,934
that this wine really is
what it pretends to be,

59
00:03:41,934 --> 00:03:45,934
this can be done--you don't want 
to open the bottle of wine.

60
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,346
Another example is, 
if you have spent several years

61
00:03:50,346 --> 00:03:53,655
in synthesizing in your compound,
and you want to verify

62
00:03:53,655 --> 00:03:58,075
that the synthesis process 
has properly worked

63
00:03:58,075 --> 00:04:01,935
and your volume of your milligrams 
of the compound that has been synthesized

64
00:04:01,935 --> 00:04:04,340
you don't want to subject it 
to an analysis

65
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:07,570
that's destructive, 
that destroys the molecules.

66
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,140
Other examples include 
structure determination solution,

67
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,990
so, since we are limited 
to soluble molecules,

68
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:22,711
this allows to study 
the molecule structure in solution,

69
00:04:22,711 --> 00:04:24,733
molecule dynamics are accessible,

70
00:04:24,733 --> 00:04:27,293
since we have <i>T_1</i>, <i>T_2</i>
and similar effects

71
00:04:27,293 --> 00:04:31,583
and also chemical reactions 
can be followed in situ.

72
00:04:32,865 --> 00:04:34,455
So, how is it done?

73
00:04:34,455 --> 00:04:36,435
Well, typically the solution 
with a compound

74
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:40,815
is put into an Eppendorf--
one needs some strong magnetic field,

75
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:45,291
just like with by medical applications--
here the <i>z</i> axis is vertical

76
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:51,211
that is a vertical bore NMR instrument, 
the sample is inserted,

77
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:55,563
data is obtained, the data is analyzed,

78
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:57,879
and here is an example 
of this complex molecule,

79
00:04:57,879 --> 00:05:01,949
and one now looks at different signals 
from this molecule,

80
00:05:01,949 --> 00:05:05,619
each corresponding 
to a different proton in the molecule.

81
00:05:07,192 --> 00:05:12,092
Or more complex here 
is the signal of protons,

82
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:14,627
this is a 2D plot [inaudible]

83
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:17,627
what signals are linked 
to other signals here.

84
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:20,021
I will come to that later.

85
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:24,365
This typical data can be analyzed,

86
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:26,855
and from that the structure 
can be determined.

87
00:05:26,855 --> 00:05:30,075
So here is the structure of a protein.

88
00:05:30,075 --> 00:05:33,815
One can see the core 
and four alpha helices here.

89
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:39,340
Here is another example of a structure
that's been determined with NMR.

90
00:05:40,017 --> 00:05:44,247
This work was pioneered by Kurt Wüthrich, 
a biophysisist from Zurich,

91
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,260
who for his work received the Nobel Prize 
in Chemistry in 2002.

92
00:05:51,107 --> 00:05:57,637
So, first, before I come 
to the chemical effects

93
00:05:57,637 --> 00:05:59,625
of how we can measure chemistry

94
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:03,555
with nuclear phenomena--
that is nuclear magnetic resonance

95
00:06:03,555 --> 00:06:07,445
I want to dwell a bit 
into the effect of the relaxation

96
00:06:07,445 --> 00:06:09,595
on the magnetization.

97
00:06:10,525 --> 00:06:13,875
So, let's look at the effect 
of T_1 and T_2 on the signal.

98
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:18,545
We have here time, 
we apply an RF pulse with flip angle <i>α</i>.

99
00:06:20,266 --> 00:06:22,356
The flip angle for such an RF pulse

100
00:06:22,356 --> 00:06:29,216
is given by <i>γ B_1</i> times its duration <i>τ</i>, 
and so the magnetization M_z

101
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:33,397
after this RF pulse is given 
by the <i>z</i> magnetization

102
00:06:33,397 --> 00:06:36,335
before the RF pulse times <i>cos α</i>.

103
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:40,537
The transversal magnetization 
after the RF pulse--

104
00:06:40,537 --> 00:06:43,481
that would be here--
is given by the <i>z</i> magnetization

105
00:06:43,481 --> 00:06:45,921
before the RF pulse times <i>sin α</i>.

106
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:48,353
So here this is 
the transversal magnetization

107
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:51,703
at this time point,
which we call <i>M_x_y (0)</i>.

108
00:06:53,286 --> 00:06:59,186
So, these are the effects 
of T_1 and T_2 on the signal,

109
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,210
are given 
by the transversal magnetization,

110
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:05,350
evolves now by this initial 
transversal magnetization

111
00:07:05,350 --> 00:07:07,920
with its exponential decay--

112
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,490
that's what we see here.

113
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,390
And so, after the RF pulse

114
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,380
the signal decays 
under the influence of <i>T_2</i> relaxation.

115
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:20,030
Now, we call this, 
this <i>z</i> magnetization at time zero,

116
00:07:20,578 --> 00:07:24,091
then this period before the RF pulse,

117
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:28,641
which we typically call 
the repetition time <i>T R</i> or <i>T I</i>,

118
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:29,785
the time of inversion--

119
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:31,875
we will see shortly 
why this is called this way--

120
00:07:32,285 --> 00:07:37,225
giving this time, we have 
the influence of T_1 relaxation.

121
00:07:37,652 --> 00:07:41,672
So. the effect of T_1 is given 
by this differential equation,

122
00:07:42,386 --> 00:07:47,986
the solution of which is given 
by this general equation here,

123
00:07:48,496 --> 00:07:52,176
and we call this equation 
also longitudinal coherence--

124
00:07:52,176 --> 00:07:53,936
and we will see shortly why.

125
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:59,367
So, if we're setting, 
<i>M_z(0)</i> is equal to this term here,

126
00:07:59,368 --> 00:08:04,718
then we substitute here the solution,

127
00:08:04,718 --> 00:08:09,674
we substitute this term here,
and we obtain this solution here.

128
00:08:12,988 --> 00:08:18,508
We call this longitudinal coherence , 
because the effect of <i>T_1</i> on the signal,

129
00:08:19,431 --> 00:08:23,153
because we ultimately obtain the <i>M_z (t)</i>.

130
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:26,311
The <i>M_z (t)</i> by the RF pulse is converted

131
00:08:26,311 --> 00:08:28,981
to transversal magnetization, 
which is being detected.

132
00:08:29,261 --> 00:08:34,661
So, the influence of <i>T_1</i> depends 
on prior RF manipulations.

133
00:08:34,998 --> 00:08:37,938
And this comes in the solution 
to our differential equation

134
00:08:38,366 --> 00:08:42,715
from this term here,
which includes prior manipulations,

135
00:08:42,715 --> 00:08:46,525
that is, prior applications 
of RF pulses, that is, <i>B_1</i> fields,

136
00:08:46,525 --> 00:08:49,715
that have been done to the magnetization.

137
00:08:50,365 --> 00:08:52,659
So, this is important here that

138
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:56,889
what we do to the magnetization 
in terms of RF pulses,

139
00:08:56,889 --> 00:09:02,889
that influences on how <i>T_1</i>
manifests itself on the signal.

140
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:07,944
So, now I want to address the question 
under what optimal conditions

141
00:09:07,944 --> 00:09:10,884
are we most sensitive to changes in <i>T_1</i>?

142
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,884
This is also a flip side of that is
under what optimal conditions

143
00:09:15,483 --> 00:09:18,333
can one measure the influence of <i>T_1</i>.

144
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:21,715
And here the term to introduce 
is <i>inversion-recovery</i>,

145
00:09:21,715 --> 00:09:26,835
and you will see shortly 
why it is called <i>inversion-recovery</i>.

146
00:09:27,864 --> 00:09:31,864
Essentially we are looking at this, say, 
application of two RF pulses--

147
00:09:31,864 --> 00:09:34,724
it is the multipulse experiment--

148
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,865
and it is a traditional experiment

149
00:09:37,865 --> 00:09:40,845
which is used to measure 
the influence of <i>T_1</i>.

150
00:09:41,405 --> 00:09:44,915
So, we consider here 
an RF pulse of flip angle <i>α</i>,

151
00:09:45,326 --> 00:09:48,996
a certain time delay <i>τ</i>
and then a 90 degree pulse.

152
00:09:49,272 --> 00:09:52,752
This time here we will call <i>T I</i>, 
or time after inversion.

153
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:57,675
This 90 degree pulse, <i>π / 2</i> pulse, 
it's sole function

154
00:09:57,675 --> 00:09:59,935
in this particular multipulse experiment

155
00:09:59,935 --> 00:10:03,695
is to convert the <i>z</i> magnetization,
which is present right here,

156
00:10:03,695 --> 00:10:06,235
into transversal magnetization,

157
00:10:06,235 --> 00:10:09,225
because we want to measure 
the <i>z</i> magnetization,

158
00:10:09,225 --> 00:10:11,266
and <i>z</i> magnetization 
cannot be directly measured,

159
00:10:11,266 --> 00:10:15,987
so one has to go through the detour

160
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:19,687
of converting it 
into transversal magnetization.

161
00:10:19,687 --> 00:10:23,687
So, that is the multipulse experiment 
we are going to consider.

162
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:28,247
So, the measured signal 
is essentially <i>z</i> magnetization

163
00:10:28,247 --> 00:10:30,687
after this time period <i>T I</i>.

164
00:10:30,687 --> 00:10:32,476
This <i>z</i> magnetization is given here

165
00:10:32,476 --> 00:10:35,806
by the solution 
of the differential equation,

166
00:10:35,806 --> 00:10:39,906
where [inaudible] 
and here we have <i>M_z (0)</i>.

167
00:10:40,150 --> 00:10:44,380
<i>M_z (0) = M_0 cos (α)</i>,

168
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:47,800
so we have waited a long time, 
we have equilibrium magnetization here,

169
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:50,340
we apply now RF pulse <i>α</i>,

170
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,780
and so the <i>z</i> magnetization 
at this time here is <i>M_0 cos (α)</i>.

171
00:10:59,864 --> 00:11:04,758
And we substitute 
this term here into this term,

172
00:11:04,758 --> 00:11:09,676
and this gives us this equation here, 
where we express the <i>z</i> magnetization

173
00:11:09,676 --> 00:11:12,436
as a function of this time <i>T I</i> here.

174
00:11:13,223 --> 00:11:17,393
Now, two things: 
What is the best choice of <i>α</i>,

175
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:19,608
so what would allow us

176
00:11:19,608 --> 00:11:25,038
to produce the most sensitive experiment 
to changes in <i>T_1</i>?

177
00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:28,494
We will use the same approach 
that we discussed last week

178
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:30,983
and we introduced in the first lecture 
in the first part of the course.

179
00:11:30,983 --> 00:11:33,893
It's the error propagation calculation.

180
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,022
So, first we are interested 
in establishing

181
00:11:36,022 --> 00:11:40,602
how sensitive is our <i>z</i> magnetization, 
right here, at this point,

182
00:11:40,602 --> 00:11:44,172
just before the <i>π / 2</i> pulse, 
to changes in <i>T_1</i>.

183
00:11:44,172 --> 00:11:48,472
That is, we calculate the derivative 
of <i>z</i> magnetization with respect to <i>T_1</i>.

184
00:11:48,472 --> 00:11:50,512
It gives us this expression here.

185
00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:52,282
Here is the <i>z</i> magnetization,

186
00:11:52,282 --> 00:11:55,272
we will take the derivative 
of this with <i>T_1</i>,

187
00:11:55,272 --> 00:11:57,666
and here we have not put <i>T I</i>,
we just put just put a time <i>t</i>,

188
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,506
and we call this function <i>F</i>.

189
00:11:59,936 --> 00:12:01,651
Now we want to know

190
00:12:01,651 --> 00:12:05,471
under what choice of <i>α</i>
is this function maximal.

191
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:09,301
So, we will take the derivative 
of this function with respect to <i>α</i>

192
00:12:09,301 --> 00:12:11,031
and will set that derivative to zero.

193
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:13,340
This tells us at what point 
with respect to <i>α</i>

194
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,470
is this function maximal.

195
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,573
And here is the derivative, 
this id non-zero, this is non-zero,

196
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:24,743
so we are interested 
in a solution, where <i>sin α = 0</i>

197
00:12:25,406 --> 00:12:27,268
And here we have two possibilities:

198
00:12:27,268 --> 00:12:31,929
<i>α = 0</i> or <i>α = π</i>.

199
00:12:31,929 --> 00:12:34,625
Now, <i>α = 0</i> is a silly experiment,

200
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,515
because then basically 
we are not applying this RF pulse,

201
00:12:37,515 --> 00:12:38,925
the flip angle is zero.

202
00:12:38,925 --> 00:12:42,240
We will be just measuring 
equilibrium magnetization,

203
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:48,240
and we are not sensitive to <i>T_1</i>, 
so the correct answer here is <i>α = π</i>.

204
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:53,719
So, <i>α = π</i> , that is a 180 degree pulse

205
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:57,300
or, as we have introduced 
earlier, two weeks ago,

206
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:01,980
this is an inversion pulse and hence 
this experiment is called inversion,

207
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:06,096
followed by recovery,
and <i>T I</i> is called time of inversion.

208
00:13:07,438 --> 00:13:12,518
So, in this particular case we have now 
the <i>z</i> magnetization as function of <i>T I</i>.

209
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:18,310
It's given by the equilibrium 
magnetization times <i>(1 - 2 e ^ T I / T_1)</i>.

210
00:13:19,633 --> 00:13:24,783
Next question is: What will be 
the proper choice of time <i>T I</i> here

211
00:13:24,783 --> 00:13:26,723
to detect changes in <i>T_1</i>?

212
00:13:27,794 --> 00:13:30,664
So, we want to choose the <i>T I</i> such--

213
00:13:30,664 --> 00:13:33,444
we have established 
that <i>α</i> is 180 degrees--

214
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:39,065
we want to choose <i>T I</i> such that we are 
most sensitive to changes in <i>T_1</i>.

215
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:43,400
So, we will take this function here

216
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,490
and we will calculate now 
the derivative of this function

217
00:13:46,490 --> 00:13:48,170
with respect to time.

218
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:51,573
Here we did it with respect to <i>α</i>
to find the optimal <i>α</i>,

219
00:13:51,573 --> 00:13:55,230
now we will do it 
with respect to this time <i>t</i> here,

220
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,590
which is our <i>T I</i>.

221
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,449
This is a chain rule, 
we get this expression here,

222
00:13:59,449 --> 00:14:04,849
we simplify the terms--this is non-zero, 
this is 2, this is non-zero,

223
00:14:04,849 --> 00:14:07,559
so the term in the bracket
has to be zero,

224
00:14:07,559 --> 00:14:12,248
and we are finding 
that the optimal inversion time <i>T I</i>

225
00:14:12,248 --> 00:14:17,638
to be sensitive to changes in <i>T_1</i> is, 
if we choose <i>T I = T_1</i>.

226
00:14:18,779 --> 00:14:20,222
This is again not surprising--

227
00:14:20,222 --> 00:14:23,960
we have an exponential function 
and, again, in an exponential function,

228
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,221
as you increase, 
you are not sensitive here,

229
00:14:26,221 --> 00:14:28,001
you are not sensitive here

230
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:30,161
somewhere in the middle, and it turn out

231
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:34,731
that you are most sensitive exactly 
when this time equals to <i>T_1</i>.
