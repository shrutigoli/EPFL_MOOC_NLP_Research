1
00:00:04,561 --> 00:00:07,464
So how can we-- and this brings us
to the question on how

2
00:00:07,464 --> 00:00:09,148
can we measure chemical shift?

3
00:00:09,352 --> 00:00:15,153
And this is done by looking 
at the free induction decay signal.

4
00:00:15,592 --> 00:00:18,277
So we have our signal 
as a function of time,

5
00:00:18,277 --> 00:00:22,954
a is the transverse magnetization 
times zero times <i>e ^ - i omega (Ω)t</i>

6
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:25,349
times <i>e ^ -t / T2</i>

7
00:00:25,645 --> 00:00:31,209
We've seen that previously
that expression, that's our time signal.

8
00:00:31,899 --> 00:00:35,934
Now let's say you have a signal
that is separated by 1 ppm.

9
00:00:35,934 --> 00:00:39,986
So that is one millionth change
in the resonance frequency.

10
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:43,407
Would we be able from such a signal
to be able to see a change

11
00:00:43,407 --> 00:00:46,876
in one millionth 
of the resonance frequency?

12
00:00:47,825 --> 00:00:50,908
Even if we place ourselves 
into the rotating reference frame

13
00:00:50,908 --> 00:00:54,808
where it might be easier to see that 
there are multiple frequencies present,

14
00:00:54,808 --> 00:01:00,136
we're not very good at detecting
in time domain signals

15
00:01:00,136 --> 00:01:02,026
the change in frequency.

16
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,488
And so here we are going to use,
what is used here is

17
00:01:05,488 --> 00:01:08,413
the Fourier transformation,
and I'll show you here

18
00:01:08,508 --> 00:01:11,480
the Fourier transformation
of this function but only

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:14,606
the real part, and we'll not take
the full expression here.

20
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:18,005
We're just interested in 
the fact that the Fourier transformation

21
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:20,402
is proportional
to the transverse magnetization

22
00:01:20,402 --> 00:01:24,260
of times zero times this function here
which is the Fourier transformation

23
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,450
of this term here,
and <i>x</i> here is given by the frequency--

24
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:33,770
that's the argument here--
minus the chemical shift.

25
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:39,579
That's the exact resonance frequency
of our compound times <i>2𝛑</i> times <i>T2</i>.

26
00:01:41,946 --> 00:01:43,248
So what does this look like?

27
00:01:43,248 --> 00:01:45,305
We'll take this signal here,
Fourier transform it,

28
00:01:45,305 --> 00:01:47,729
and we're getting this line shape here.

29
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:50,269
This function here is 
a Lorentzian function.

30
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,999
It has its maximum when Ω is equal 
to delta (Δ), then <i>x</i> gets zero.

31
00:01:55,173 --> 00:02:01,708
This is maximally and the full width
at half maximum here is given

32
00:02:01,708 --> 00:02:04,848
by <i>1 / 𝛑 T2</i>

33
00:02:04,848 --> 00:02:07,619
That's the full width of half maximum

34
00:02:11,174 --> 00:02:16,107
of the function of Fourier transformed,
which is also called the peak.

35
00:02:16,107 --> 00:02:22,121
Now the area of the resonance is
proportional to the magnetization

36
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:24,108
at times zero, this here.

37
00:02:24,108 --> 00:02:25,833
This is proportional to the number

38
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:29,719
of nuclei and therefore proportional
to the concentration if one can neglect

39
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:34,031
the effect of relaxation
in particular here T1 relaxation.

40
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:37,432
So in this case,
we are obtaining a signal,

41
00:02:37,432 --> 00:02:43,056
the area of this resonance here
is proportional to the concentration.

42
00:02:44,326 --> 00:02:47,365
So to verify this, we have the signal
at times zero is equal

43
00:02:47,365 --> 00:02:52,683
to the inverse Fourier transform
of <i>G(Ω)</i> which is <i>e ^ i Ω t (d Ω) </i>

44
00:02:52,834 --> 00:02:55,165
but now we'll evaluate this 
at times zero

45
00:02:55,165 --> 00:02:57,765
to obtain the signal at times zero.

46
00:02:58,257 --> 00:03:02,648
So that is the integral 
of this function <i>G(Ω)</i>.

47
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:04,389
So that's the integral of this.

48
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:06,636
That's nothing 
but the area of the function,

49
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:09,427
and we can see that this is now--

50
00:03:09,427 --> 00:03:12,427
the area is proportional to this term here

51
00:03:12,427 --> 00:03:18,552
so it's proportional to <i>M zero</i>
if we neglect the effects of relaxation.

52
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:25,157
Now let me illustrate this
with a molecule that most of us

53
00:03:25,157 --> 00:03:27,900
have been exposed to in their life
and that's ethanol.

54
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,879
So ethanol's found in,
among others, in nice wines.

55
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,093
Here's its structure.
It's got a CH3 group,

56
00:03:36,093 --> 00:03:39,389
the methylene group and an OH group,
the alcohol here.

57
00:03:39,389 --> 00:03:41,453
Here's the 3D rendering.
Here's the oxygen.

58
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:44,302
Here are the carbons
and in white are the hydrogens

59
00:03:44,302 --> 00:03:46,530
which we are interested in.

60
00:03:47,203 --> 00:03:52,245
And if you now take a milliliter of wine
or ethanol and you put it

61
00:03:52,245 --> 00:03:56,564
into your NMR spectrometer,
then you observe three peaks,

62
00:03:56,564 --> 00:03:58,075
similar to here.

63
00:03:58,075 --> 00:04:00,813
Three peaks here,
this is the reference peak

64
00:04:00,813 --> 00:04:05,342
of the reference compound TMS,
that sets us the zero ppm scale.

65
00:04:07,236 --> 00:04:11,024
What we are observing is three peaks,
if we know there's only one compound

66
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:15,057
in there, then we know we have
three different types of protons

67
00:04:15,057 --> 00:04:20,945
in that molecule that are subject 
to three different chemical environments.

68
00:04:20,945 --> 00:04:25,252
But we actually know more 
because we can also calculate

69
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:29,208
the area under the curve,
that is this function here.

70
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:32,418
And we'll see here this is the red curve.

71
00:04:32,418 --> 00:04:37,570
That's just integrating from infinity
to whatever frequency is plotted here.

72
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:40,398
We'll see an increase here,
that's the area of this peak here.

73
00:04:40,398 --> 00:04:43,376
Then this area here is twice 
as high as this one,

74
00:04:43,376 --> 00:04:46,720
and this area is three times as high here.

75
00:04:47,117 --> 00:04:50,350
So if we know that there's 
only one compound in our sample,

76
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:54,458
aside from TMS, and we know
that the ratio is 1: 2: 3,

77
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:59,058
then we know that there are 
three protons that have essentially

78
00:04:59,058 --> 00:05:01,004
the same chemical environment.

79
00:05:01,004 --> 00:05:05,228
They are to the right
so they have a lower ppm

80
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:08,472
so they are in a less 
electronegative environment.

81
00:05:08,653 --> 00:05:11,976
We have two protons 
in a more electronegative environment

82
00:05:11,976 --> 00:05:15,298
and one proton 
in the most electronegative environment.

83
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:18,757
This is actually where we expect
the OH groups to be,

84
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:21,698
and so it's easy to deduce from this data

85
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:25,610
that this is the most probable molecule
that we are observing.

86
00:05:27,995 --> 00:05:32,976
So we'll stick with the example 
of ethanol for what is to come.

87
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:37,045
There's an additional effect 
of chemical proximity

88
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:40,164
that I want to illustrate,
and we'll stick here with the example

89
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:41,834
of ethanol.

90
00:05:42,489 --> 00:05:45,996
So we have here, again, here's TMS,

91
00:05:45,996 --> 00:05:47,996
here's the methyl signal, the methylene

92
00:05:47,996 --> 00:05:50,550
and here's the OH signal.

93
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,522
Here's the chemical shift scale
here in ppm.

94
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:57,995
So on the horizontal axis
and as a a reminder,

95
00:05:57,995 --> 00:06:01,130
here is the molecule 
that we are discussing.

96
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:04,693
Now if you look at the methyl signal,
we actually see this is not one resonance

97
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:08,094
but there's three signals that we see.

98
00:06:08,094 --> 00:06:10,428
And for methylene, we see four signals.

99
00:06:10,428 --> 00:06:13,922
And what I want to explain here
in the next few minutes is

100
00:06:13,922 --> 00:06:18,503
the origin of these extra resonances
that are observed.

101
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:24,200
And essentially what they are 
dealing with here is a hyperfine splitting

102
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:27,300
of the resonance frequency.

103
00:06:28,399 --> 00:06:31,042
The main mechanism 
that we have to consider here is

104
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:34,187
that the nucleus which has 
a nucleomagnetic moment

105
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:39,001
produces a very, very small 
magnetic field linked to its dipole.

106
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:44,258
So we have <i>B zero</i>,
we have the electron cloud.

107
00:06:44,258 --> 00:06:49,050
And now if we have the same electron cloud
but we have a nearby nuclear spin,

108
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,986
then this nuclear spin will produce
an extra magentic field,

109
00:06:53,986 --> 00:06:58,932
this magnetic moment that adds 
to the magnetic field of <i>B zero,</i>

110
00:06:58,932 --> 00:07:03,639
and therefore, has an effect 
on the electron cloud.

111
00:07:04,425 --> 00:07:09,387
So this additional tiny magnetic field
that's linked to the dipole of the nucleus

112
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:14,496
this additional magnetic field
for a spin one half nucleus like hydrogen,

113
00:07:14,496 --> 00:07:19,273
like the proton is either oriented up
or oriented down.

114
00:07:19,273 --> 00:07:24,437
So this changes polarity,
and this will affect the electron cloud

115
00:07:24,437 --> 00:07:30,740
in the molecule and therefore alter 
the magnetic field at a nearby nucleus.

116
00:07:31,705 --> 00:07:34,671
So if I have a nuclear spin here,
this nuclear spin points

117
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:37,469
either in this direction
or in that direction.

118
00:07:37,469 --> 00:07:40,551
This will create 
an additional magnetic field.

119
00:07:40,551 --> 00:07:43,805
This creates an additional reorientation
of the electron cloud

120
00:07:43,805 --> 00:07:47,497
and at the site of the nucleus
that we're measuring,

121
00:07:47,497 --> 00:07:51,306
it will then, depending 
on its orientation, create a small change

122
00:07:51,306 --> 00:07:56,470
in the resonance frequency
or the Larmor frequency.

123
00:07:57,265 --> 00:08:00,305
So let's say we have 
a nearby spin one half,

124
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:02,395
and we'll look here 
at the proton resonance.

125
00:08:02,395 --> 00:08:05,597
So we are here interested 
in this proton here,

126
00:08:05,597 --> 00:08:10,136
and we have now a nearby spin
one half nucleus.

127
00:08:11,714 --> 00:08:14,751
Here it's pointing down,
and here it's pointing up.

128
00:08:14,751 --> 00:08:20,406
And so therefore it produces a--
in our nucleus hydrogen of interest

129
00:08:20,406 --> 00:08:24,317
which is this guy, the electron cloud
will change its configuration

130
00:08:24,317 --> 00:08:27,875
ever so slightly depending 
on whether that nearby spin one half

131
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:33,678
is oriented upwards or downwards with 
respect to the external magnetic field,

132
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:38,202
and this results in a split
of the resonance frequency

133
00:08:39,157 --> 00:08:43,341
and the intensity of the resulting 
two peaks is exactly the same.

134
00:08:44,955 --> 00:08:47,289
Now why is it exactly the same?

135
00:08:48,235 --> 00:08:51,684
Now remember we had dealt 
with the Boltzmann distribution.

136
00:08:51,684 --> 00:08:54,432
So we had said the probability
whether it's up or down,

137
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:56,867
that probability is 
essentially 50 percent.

138
00:08:57,358 --> 00:09:02,922
Well, one is 50.00001 percent
and the other one is 49.99999 percent

139
00:09:02,922 --> 00:09:06,429
but in terms of intensity 
we don't see these small differences,

140
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:11,758
so it is essentially the 50 percent 
up or down and so therefore

141
00:09:11,758 --> 00:09:16,146
the number of protons that see
the spin up or the number of protons

142
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:20,501
that see a spin one half down 
is the same and therefore

143
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:25,978
we're seeing this signal split

144
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:28,978
into two peaks of equal magnitude,

145
00:09:28,978 --> 00:09:30,852
and that's called a doublet.

146
00:09:31,578 --> 00:09:35,600
Now for a CH2 group, 
so if we're now here on the methyl,

147
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,209
we have nearby the methylene,
that's two protons.

148
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:42,691
That's these guys,
and these two protons, we'll assume here

149
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:46,177
that they are
chemically indistinguishable,

150
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:49,500
and so we have four probabilities:

151
00:09:50,709 --> 00:09:55,086
up up, down down,
up down and down up.

152
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:57,562
So four probabilities.

153
00:09:57,562 --> 00:10:02,982
They are of equal possibilities,

154
00:10:02,982 --> 00:10:08,201
four configurations of equal probability:
up up, down down.

155
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:11,972
That's easy. 
Up down and down up,

156
00:10:11,972 --> 00:10:16,737
we cannot distinguish them
because the two dipole fields

157
00:10:16,737 --> 00:10:20,726
of the two protons in the CH2 group
cancel each other

158
00:10:20,726 --> 00:10:24,095
so up down or down up 
will produce the same change

159
00:10:24,095 --> 00:10:27,076
on the electron cloud.

160
00:10:27,076 --> 00:10:31,026
And so we have a triplet peak

161
00:10:31,026 --> 00:10:34,345
with a relative intensity ratio 
of 1: 2: 1.

162
00:10:36,501 --> 00:10:41,709
We're here observing three protons,
but the next molecule

163
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,937
that this interacts with has two protons,

164
00:10:43,937 --> 00:10:48,256
so we have four possibilities:
one, one and two,

165
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:50,197
that's the up down, down up.

166
00:10:50,197 --> 00:10:53,926
Now at the CH2 position,
if I look at the protons that are here,

167
00:10:53,926 --> 00:10:58,689
they are seeing three protons
from the methyl, three protons.

168
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:02,405
So three protons, and they are--
because the methyl typically

169
00:11:02,405 --> 00:11:08,095
rotates very fast-- the three protons,
they are having a number

170
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:12,537
of combinations, and actually we have
eight combinations.

171
00:11:12,537 --> 00:11:15,371
We have up up up, up up down,

172
00:11:15,371 --> 00:11:18,082
up down up, down up up,

173
00:11:19,027 --> 00:11:20,957
down down up, down up down,

174
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:24,802
up down down
and down down down

175
00:11:24,802 --> 00:11:27,402
so if you count this,
this was eight possibilities,

176
00:11:27,402 --> 00:11:29,560
and so we have a quartet.

177
00:11:29,936 --> 00:11:33,296
Up up down, up down up,

178
00:11:33,296 --> 00:11:37,143
and so on are indistinguishable,
same thing for the other cases.

179
00:11:37,143 --> 00:11:39,495
They cannot be distinguished.

180
00:11:39,495 --> 00:11:43,816
So this gives us a quartet,
a resonance which is split

181
00:11:43,816 --> 00:11:47,222
into 1: 3: 3: 1 intensity structure.

182
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:52,868
So to conclude here,
in the case of ethanol

183
00:11:52,868 --> 00:11:55,422
we see three peaks, 
we have already a good idea

184
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:59,518
that there most likely are three protons

185
00:11:59,518 --> 00:12:02,969
in the same chemical environment,
but what this kind of splitting tells us

186
00:12:02,969 --> 00:12:07,601
indeed this whatever is in here 
is close to a CH2,

187
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:12,943
and whatever is in here is
close to a CH3,

188
00:12:12,943 --> 00:12:16,324
and from the relative intensity
2: 3 of the entire area,

189
00:12:16,324 --> 00:12:20,354
two to three,
it is easy to deduce that the molecule

190
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:24,313
that one observes here is
indeed ethanol.

191
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:29,837
So I want to give here an example
and that is phosphorus spectroscopy.

192
00:12:29,837 --> 00:12:33,291
Well, phosphorus spectroscopy was 
actually the first application

193
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,859
of strong magnetic fields
to living humans.

194
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:41,387
There was an interest in looking 
at phosphorus metabolism,

195
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:46,438
phosphate metabolism in the human brain
as well as in muscle,

196
00:12:46,438 --> 00:12:49,403
so these were the first 
in vivo applications,

197
00:12:49,403 --> 00:12:52,076
and I want to illustrate here
the type of information

198
00:12:52,076 --> 00:12:53,338
that one can get.

199
00:12:53,607 --> 00:12:56,952
So this is a phosphorus spectrum,
and this is taken

200
00:12:56,952 --> 00:13:00,338
from the brain region here
indicated in yellow.

201
00:13:01,028 --> 00:13:04,126
One observes the signal 
due to phosphocreatine.

202
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:07,724
We have phosphomonoesters 
such as phospho-ethanolamine

203
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:08,907
and phosphocholine.

204
00:13:08,907 --> 00:13:12,288
These are membrane anabolic
compounds.

205
00:13:12,288 --> 00:13:16,849
Then one has glycerophosphocholine
and glycerophosphoethanolamine,

206
00:13:16,849 --> 00:13:20,608
breakdown products 
of lipid metabolism.

207
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:23,923
And then we have 
adenosine triphosphate.

208
00:13:24,952 --> 00:13:28,843
I presume you're all familiar
with ATP, its structure,

209
00:13:28,843 --> 00:13:33,164
so we have adenosine triphosphate,
so we know there's three phosphates in it,

210
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:35,721
and indeed we have three resonances.

211
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:40,944
The alpha (𝞪) is the one
that is closest to the ribose.

212
00:13:40,944 --> 00:13:44,068
This is the 𝞪, this is the beta (β),
this is the gamma (𝛄),

213
00:13:44,068 --> 00:13:49,354
and we can observe three peaks
related to ATP.

214
00:13:49,354 --> 00:13:52,471
And what we can also see here
is the splitting here.

215
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:54,844
This tell us that there's 
a nearby phosphorous

216
00:13:54,844 --> 00:13:56,327
relative to this.

217
00:13:56,327 --> 00:13:58,375
Relative to this peak,
there's a nearby phosphorous,

218
00:13:58,375 --> 00:14:00,865
and if we can see here,
there's a 1: 2: 1 structure.

219
00:14:00,865 --> 00:14:02,930
It's not a very good 
signal-to-noise ratio here,

220
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,705
but it indicates itself,
and so we see that this must be linked

221
00:14:06,705 --> 00:14:10,491
to two phosphates nearby,
and indeed this is the β,

222
00:14:10,491 --> 00:14:13,941
the middle one which sees
this one and this one as well.

223
00:14:14,307 --> 00:14:18,545
We also have inorganic phosphate,
which is resonance 24,

224
00:14:18,545 --> 00:14:25,105
which is this peak here,
and dinucleotides NAD or NADP.

225
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:27,882
Whether it's with the H
or without the H,

226
00:14:27,882 --> 00:14:31,194
the dinucleotides contribute
to this signal here.

227
00:14:32,327 --> 00:14:34,881
So these are the compounds 
that can be observed.

228
00:14:34,881 --> 00:14:38,416
They are linked to a large extent 
to cellular energetics.

229
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:42,139
What is also measured is
intercellular pH from the position

230
00:14:42,139 --> 00:14:46,411
of this peak creating kinase activity
by measuring the conversion

231
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:51,493
between phosphocreatine and ATP
and ATPAs by measuring

232
00:14:51,493 --> 00:14:55,056
their conversion 
of inorganic phosphate and ATP.

233
00:14:55,056 --> 00:14:57,751
These are reactions 
that can also be measured.

234
00:14:58,257 --> 00:15:02,201
So this is an example 
of what the information

235
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:06,725
that is obtainable and can be done.

236
00:15:06,725 --> 00:15:08,552
Here's the example of phosphorous.

237
00:15:08,552 --> 00:15:11,263
Like I mentioned, phosphorous,
for historical reasons,

238
00:15:11,263 --> 00:15:15,843
was the first nucleus
to be studied in vivo.
