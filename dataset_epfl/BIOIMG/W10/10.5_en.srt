1
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:08,316
The question now arises, 
what can MR spectroscopy measure?

2
00:00:08,316 --> 00:00:13,226
I've just given you an example,
phosphorus, out of historical interest.

3
00:00:13,226 --> 00:00:16,592
Essentially MR spectroscopy 
allows to assess

4
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:20,599
the concentration 
of biochemical compounds in vivo.

5
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:25,319
The signal is typically proportional 
to the number of spins present

6
00:00:25,319 --> 00:00:28,429
and in particular to the concentration.

7
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:31,561
After the Fourier transform, 
what one does is measure the area,

8
00:00:31,561 --> 00:00:35,030
so integrate in this case.

9
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:39,659
This is assuming 
that the effect of relaxation,

10
00:00:39,669 --> 00:00:41,921
such as T1, 
has been taken into account,

11
00:00:41,921 --> 00:00:44,322
but it's still proportional 
to the concentration,

12
00:00:44,322 --> 00:00:47,194
even if there is a flight of T1.

13
00:00:47,194 --> 00:00:50,622
Now what compounds can one detect?

14
00:00:50,622 --> 00:00:54,070
And there are three rules 
I want to share with you here.

15
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:56,920
One is, one needs typically 
a concentration

16
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,792
on the order of millimoles, millimolar.

17
00:01:00,792 --> 00:01:02,725
If you translate this 
into tissue concentration,

18
00:01:02,725 --> 00:01:06,434
since the density is roughly 1 g/mL

19
00:01:06,434 --> 00:01:11,002
this translates into typically 
1 μM/g wet weight

20
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:15,512
to give you an idea of the concentration

21
00:01:15,512 --> 00:01:18,455
that one needs to be able 
to see the signal.

22
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:24,051
Then what one would need is typically
a water-soluble compound.

23
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:27,482
It doesn't have to be exactly--

24
00:01:27,482 --> 00:01:30,625
but it is a good guess 
that if it is highly water-soluble

25
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,915
then it is sufficiently mobile
to be detected.

26
00:01:33,915 --> 00:01:38,047
Remember, T2 is very short 
for immobile signals.

27
00:01:38,047 --> 00:01:44,315
So the main requirement here
is mobile but a good indication here

28
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:46,559
is water-soluble compounds.

29
00:01:46,559 --> 00:01:49,623
We can, for example, 
measure vitamin C in our brains,

30
00:01:49,623 --> 00:01:52,259
we know it is 1.5 μM/g.

31
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,512
The concentration of vitamin E
which intercalates into the membranes

32
00:01:56,512 --> 00:02:02,050
in the lipid bilayers is not detectable.

33
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,890
Third one to remember is the influence
of the gyromagnetic ratio.

34
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:12,022
So proton, the hydrogen nucleus 
of the proton,

35
00:02:12,022 --> 00:02:14,622
is the most sensitive nucleus.

36
00:02:16,712 --> 00:02:18,938
So taken together, if we are now looking

37
00:02:18,938 --> 00:02:22,321
at the spatial resolution 
that's achievable,

38
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:26,828
we have to bear in mind 
that the voxel volume that one can,

39
00:02:26,828 --> 00:02:28,569
in a certain amount of time measure,

40
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:30,982
is inversely proportional to the signal.

41
00:02:30,982 --> 00:02:34,946
The more signal we have, 
the smaller the voxel can be.

42
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,260
And here's an example, this is 
phosphorus spectroscopy of the heart.

43
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,858
Here's an MRI of the heart 
and here this little square is the voxel

44
00:02:42,858 --> 00:02:47,034
from which the phosphorus data 
has been taken.

45
00:02:47,034 --> 00:02:48,603
So if you look at this grid here,

46
00:02:48,603 --> 00:02:51,905
which gives you the size 
of the voxels in the heart,

47
00:02:52,885 --> 00:02:56,786
this grid has a course resolution 
that would not allow us

48
00:02:56,786 --> 00:03:01,112
to detect the individual 
anatomic features of the heart,

49
00:03:01,112 --> 00:03:02,624
so it's much bigger.

50
00:03:02,624 --> 00:03:06,106
And why is this so?
Well, let's look at water.

51
00:03:06,106 --> 00:03:12,205
The water protons in the tissue 
are at roughly 80M concentration.

52
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:14,487
Biochemical compounds, on the other hand,

53
00:03:14,487 --> 00:03:18,624
are typically on the order 
of millimolar concentration.

54
00:03:18,624 --> 00:03:23,517
So we're looking at something that is 
roughly 10^5 times more concentrated

55
00:03:23,517 --> 00:03:24,849
when we image water

56
00:03:24,849 --> 00:03:29,208
compared to when we measure
informational biochemical compounds.

57
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:32,308
So one gets, as a good ballpark,

58
00:03:32,308 --> 00:03:35,618
a millimeter spatial resolution in humans.

59
00:03:35,618 --> 00:03:39,317
For water MRI 
and for biochemical compounds

60
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:44,057
the spatial resolution is typically 
on centimeters in humans.

61
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:48,571
If one looks at rodents, one can get 
50 microns spatial resolution

62
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:51,347
in rodents for water imaging

63
00:03:51,347 --> 00:03:56,111
and millimeter spatial resolution 
in rodents

64
00:03:56,111 --> 00:03:59,540
for the biochemical compounds.

65
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:02,154
So these are some ideas.

66
00:04:02,154 --> 00:04:06,872
The main point here is, the difference 
between what one can see with MRI

67
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:09,322
this gray-scale image versus

68
00:04:09,322 --> 00:04:12,370
what the biochemical measurements 
with spectroscopy,

69
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:14,836
the main difference here 
has to deal with the fact

70
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:20,703
that the concentration 
of most biochemical compounds of interest

71
00:04:20,703 --> 00:04:23,385
is on the order of millimolar.

72
00:04:25,105 --> 00:04:26,469
Now, there's a question:

73
00:04:26,469 --> 00:04:30,083
"Why is spatial resolution 
better for the rodent studies?"

74
00:04:30,848 --> 00:04:32,535
Think about it.

75
00:04:34,175 --> 00:04:37,296
Assume you have the same compound, 
same concentration

76
00:04:37,296 --> 00:04:39,585
and the same external magnetic field.

77
00:04:39,585 --> 00:04:43,546
Why do we get a better signal, 
a better spatial resolution

78
00:04:43,546 --> 00:04:45,325
in rodent studies?

79
00:04:47,975 --> 00:04:51,302
Well, the answer is, as we have seen,

80
00:04:51,302 --> 00:04:55,669
the RF coils which detect our signal

81
00:04:55,669 --> 00:05:00,159
are dictated to a large part by <i>B_0 sub r</i>

82
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:02,231
which means that we want the coil to be

83
00:05:02,231 --> 00:05:04,358
as close to the organ as possible.

84
00:05:04,358 --> 00:05:06,429
And if you look at a mouse head,

85
00:05:06,429 --> 00:05:09,170
which is roughly the size here 
of my small finger,

86
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,992
the entire dimension of the mouse head,
corresponds to skull thickness

87
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:17,268
and fat on my head, for example.

88
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:22,626
So a RF coil that's designed to detect
a signal from the mouse brain

89
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:25,456
would not even see the signal 
in the human brain.

90
00:05:25,456 --> 00:05:27,372
And so because the detector,

91
00:05:27,372 --> 00:05:31,376
the RF coil, is further away 
from the organ of interest in humans,

92
00:05:31,376 --> 00:05:35,163
the spatial resolution is also lower.

93
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:39,112
Now we have seen that 
there's a huge advantage

94
00:05:39,112 --> 00:05:40,550
in imaging the water.

95
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,467
What if we're interested in measuring

96
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:46,950
the signal from biochemical compounds
which carry protons?

97
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:49,889
We have to deal with the fact
that we have a strong signal from water,

98
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:52,628
which is response to concentration of 80M

99
00:05:52,628 --> 00:05:55,618
in order to be able to detect 
a signal of our compounds,

100
00:05:55,618 --> 00:05:58,734
which is on the order of millimolar.

101
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:03,296
And here's an example.
We have water and phenylalanine.

102
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:08,405
This is just looking at 
the full signal of this mixture

103
00:06:08,405 --> 00:06:12,016
and here if one scales this up,
now the vertical scale has been expanded,

104
00:06:12,016 --> 00:06:16,042
one can see the resonance
is end up due to phenylalanine.

105
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:17,941
And then here's the same thing shown again

106
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:21,726
but now there has been something
done to the water magnetization

107
00:06:21,726 --> 00:06:26,089
so the signal from water 
is much reduced.

108
00:06:26,089 --> 00:06:29,978
Now how can one suppress the resonance?

109
00:06:29,978 --> 00:06:33,869
How can one suppress the signal
from a particular compound?

110
00:06:33,869 --> 00:06:36,129
And this is done 
with resonance suppression

111
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:41,049
or with reducing the magnetization
that is being detected

112
00:06:41,049 --> 00:06:43,521
relative to that resonance.

113
00:06:43,521 --> 00:06:49,438
And the simplest procedure here 
to describe is where one takes

114
00:06:49,438 --> 00:06:52,527
the z magnetization of, let's say, water

115
00:06:52,527 --> 00:06:55,397
and one takes the z magnetization

116
00:06:55,397 --> 00:06:59,103
and applies a so-called 
<i>selective</i> 90 degree pulse

117
00:06:59,103 --> 00:07:02,941
on the resonance of the water
or on the signal to be suppressed here,

118
00:07:02,941 --> 00:07:06,280
particularly we'll stick with water.

119
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:11,519
So the experiment to be done 
is a selective 90 degree pulse.

120
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:18,283
This selectivity, remember, 
the selectivity is determined by <i>B_1.</i>

121
00:07:18,283 --> 00:07:20,152
We have said we can roughly excite

122
00:07:20,152 --> 00:07:26,156
a bandwidth that corresponds 
to <i>γ B_1/(2π)</i> in frequency

123
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:31,963
so one uses a weak <i>B_1,</i>
a 90 degree pulse,

124
00:07:31,963 --> 00:07:35,236
so <i>γ B_1 τ</i> has to give us 90 degrees.

125
00:07:35,236 --> 00:07:39,564
If <i>B_1</i> is weak the pulse has to be long,
so it's a long RF pulse.

126
00:07:41,354 --> 00:07:45,286
After that pulse, 
the z magnetization of the water is zero

127
00:07:45,286 --> 00:07:49,174
but that of the other compounds
has not been affected

128
00:07:49,174 --> 00:07:52,256
because the B effect is along z.

129
00:07:52,256 --> 00:07:54,990
And then one applies, for example,

130
00:07:54,990 --> 00:08:00,948
an <i>α</i> degree pulse 
for excitation of a detection.

131
00:08:00,948 --> 00:08:03,638
We'll assume here 
that something has been done

132
00:08:03,638 --> 00:08:07,780
between the 90 degree pulse on water
and this excitation pulse

133
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:12,639
such that the transverse magnetization
of the water does not generate

134
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:14,576
a measurable signal.

135
00:08:14,576 --> 00:08:17,943
You can assume it has been decayed by T2.

136
00:08:17,943 --> 00:08:22,340
We'll discuss, in next week's lecture,
some of the measures

137
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,230
that allow us to destroy 
the transverse magnetization

138
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,088
that is by dephasing.

139
00:08:28,088 --> 00:08:31,950
But for now we'll just assume
this has been done.

140
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:35,570
So our signal here then will contain 
only the signals of interest

141
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,322
and the water is no longer there.

142
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:40,433
So let's take an example from muscle here.

143
00:08:40,433 --> 00:08:42,342
This is the water signal,

144
00:08:42,342 --> 00:08:45,366
here we have the lipid signals,

145
00:08:45,366 --> 00:08:47,545
water and fat.

146
00:08:47,545 --> 00:08:51,989
And now one applies 
such a 90 degree selective pulse

147
00:08:51,989 --> 00:08:53,963
on the water signal

148
00:08:53,963 --> 00:08:56,425
and here is the signal 
that is being observed.

149
00:08:56,425 --> 00:09:00,932
Not very interesting because at this scale
we can roughly see some bump here,

150
00:09:00,932 --> 00:09:04,442
so one can vertically expand this scale.

151
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:09,555
And now we can see all 
the resonances linked to the fat signal,

152
00:09:09,555 --> 00:09:13,548
monounsaturated fatty acids,
polyunsaturated fatty acids

153
00:09:13,548 --> 00:09:18,547
and all sorts of different 
chemical environments of the proton nuclei

154
00:09:18,547 --> 00:09:22,233
and the water signal here 
is substantially reduced.

155
00:09:22,233 --> 00:09:26,215
That allows to see those details.

156
00:09:26,215 --> 00:09:30,445
So this technique is being used also

157
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:34,295
in MRI for producing Fat-Sat scans,

158
00:09:34,295 --> 00:09:35,955
fat suppressed scans.

159
00:09:35,955 --> 00:09:40,680
So we'll first take the technique,
we'll have here the signal from water

160
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,846
and from the lipid or fat

161
00:09:42,846 --> 00:09:47,658
and if one applies now 
a selective pulse on the water,

162
00:09:47,658 --> 00:09:49,112
the water signal has been suppressed

163
00:09:49,112 --> 00:09:52,722
and one has only the fat signal 
to contend with.

164
00:09:52,722 --> 00:09:57,121
Conversely, if the resonance frequency

165
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:00,591
of this long, weak RF pulse is adjusted

166
00:10:00,591 --> 00:10:02,670
to be on the resonance with the fat

167
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:05,334
then the fat signal is being saturated,

168
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:10,994
that is the z magnetization 
of the fat magnetization is set to zero

169
00:10:10,994 --> 00:10:13,222
and one obtains a water-only signal

170
00:10:13,222 --> 00:10:16,619
or more precisely a Fat-Sat scan.

171
00:10:18,599 --> 00:10:22,535
So now I want to give an example 
of proton spectroscopy of the brain.

172
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:27,803
So we'll plot the chemical shift axis,
that's in parts per million,

173
00:10:27,803 --> 00:10:32,460
and this is a proton spectrum 
of the brain.

174
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,766
One will notice here, 
one of the signals that is negative,

175
00:10:36,766 --> 00:10:40,342
this is actually the incompletely 
suppressed water signal

176
00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:43,085
so water suppression, as we have 
discussed before, has been applied

177
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:46,867
and this is the information 
that we can obtain.

178
00:10:46,867 --> 00:10:50,064
We have resonances linked 
to energy metabolism

179
00:10:50,064 --> 00:10:53,137
such as phosphocreatine and creatine.

180
00:10:54,957 --> 00:10:56,224
They are here.

181
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:59,298
So phosphocreatine and creatine,
whether phosphate is present or not

182
00:10:59,298 --> 00:11:02,248
does have an influence 
on the chemical shift

183
00:11:02,248 --> 00:11:06,646
of the methylene proton in creatine.

184
00:11:06,646 --> 00:11:10,921
One has the signal from glucose,
that's this tiny little guy here,

185
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:15,239
I have lactate at this position

186
00:11:15,239 --> 00:11:18,309
and alanine which is nearby.

187
00:11:18,309 --> 00:11:20,959
Lactate and alanine 
share a metabolic reaction

188
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,084
that's alanine aminotransferase.

189
00:11:24,084 --> 00:11:26,449
Compounds that are linked 
to neurotransmission in the brain

190
00:11:26,449 --> 00:11:31,182
are glutamate, which has 
multiple resonances,

191
00:11:31,182 --> 00:11:35,290
there's two CH2 groups 
and a CH group in it;

192
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:37,931
glutamine which is 
structurally very similar,

193
00:11:37,931 --> 00:11:41,482
so compound number 7 is close
to compound number 6;

194
00:11:41,482 --> 00:11:45,381
gamma-aminobutyric acid,

195
00:11:45,381 --> 00:11:48,381
which has multiple resonances as well;

196
00:11:48,381 --> 00:11:50,853
and N-acetyle-aspartyl-glutamate,

197
00:11:50,853 --> 00:11:54,293
a dipeptide involved in neurotransmission.

198
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:57,035
We have aspartate that's also been linked

199
00:11:57,035 --> 00:11:58,975
to the processes in neurotransmission,

200
00:11:58,975 --> 00:12:00,809
and glycine as well.

201
00:12:02,309 --> 00:12:08,495
And we have also serine 
contributing to the spectrum.

202
00:12:08,495 --> 00:12:13,098
We go on with compounds that are 
typically linked to membrane metabolism.

203
00:12:13,098 --> 00:12:17,735
Phosphoethanolamine 
and glycerophosphocholine,

204
00:12:17,735 --> 00:12:20,886
they are here, and here, and here.

205
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:26,067
And N-acetyl-aspartate,
which has the aspartyl group, is here,

206
00:12:26,067 --> 00:12:30,697
and here is the acetyl group, 
this prominent signal here.

207
00:12:31,367 --> 00:12:34,337
So these are the compounds linked 
to membrane metabolism.

208
00:12:34,337 --> 00:12:38,968
And finally there are some compounds 
linked to either antioxidative defenses,

209
00:12:38,968 --> 00:12:41,457
such as glutathione,

210
00:12:44,487 --> 00:12:47,657
vitamin C, ascorbate, taurine,

211
00:12:47,657 --> 00:12:52,117
and myo-inositol linked to taurine

212
00:12:52,117 --> 00:12:57,032
and myo-inositol have mostly 
been linked to osmoregulation

213
00:12:57,032 --> 00:12:58,962
but in the case of taurine,

214
00:12:58,962 --> 00:13:02,414
there's most likely 
multiple roles in the brain.

215
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:07,421
And finally we have an isoform 
that is scyllo-inositol

216
00:13:07,421 --> 00:13:11,012
that contributes, as well, 
to the proton spectrum of the brain.

217
00:13:11,012 --> 00:13:12,817
So it's a wealth of chemical information

218
00:13:12,817 --> 00:13:15,527
on a number of important 
biochemical processes

219
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:20,197
that can be measured in vivo
with proton spectroscopy,

220
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:24,243
and we'll briefly discuss 
on how these measurements are done

221
00:13:24,243 --> 00:13:27,573
and then I will give some examples

222
00:13:27,573 --> 00:13:30,211
and illustrate the measurements 
that are possible.

223
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:36,226
So we have introduced 
that the area under a peak

224
00:13:36,226 --> 00:13:38,996
is essentially proportional 
to its concentration

225
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:45,187
and so how can we actually get 
biochemical concentrations in vivo?

226
00:13:45,187 --> 00:13:49,874
So we'll look at the proton spectrum
here again, here is a measured example.

227
00:13:49,874 --> 00:13:55,148
And then what is done is a fit 
that's been made to that spectrum

228
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:57,985
and one looks at the residual.

229
00:13:57,985 --> 00:14:00,410
And I just want to illustrate 
this principle here

230
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:04,247
because for most compounds we know
the ionic strength, we know the pH

231
00:14:04,247 --> 00:14:05,918
and we of course know the temperature.

232
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:09,588
So one knows very precisely
the exact resonance frequency,

233
00:14:09,588 --> 00:14:12,739
that is Larmor frequency, 
of the particular compounds

234
00:14:12,739 --> 00:14:14,399
and their groups.

235
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:16,336
So we have N-acetyl-aspartate.

236
00:14:16,336 --> 00:14:20,679
We have the acetyl group here
and the aspartyl group, which is here.

237
00:14:20,679 --> 00:14:23,321
Here's the chemical structure
that we're looking at

238
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:27,398
and these are the peaks 
that are recognizable here.

239
00:14:27,398 --> 00:14:30,832
We have glutamine, here's its structure

240
00:14:30,832 --> 00:14:35,032
and here are the peaks
that are linked to the glutamine,

241
00:14:35,032 --> 00:14:37,951
two CH2 groups and one CH group.

242
00:14:37,951 --> 00:14:41,321
And finally we have glutamate.

243
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:44,303
Here's its structure and glutamate 
has these resonances.

244
00:14:44,303 --> 00:14:46,696
Note this, the difference 
between glutamate and glutamine

245
00:14:46,696 --> 00:14:53,554
is this NH2 group that changes 
this group here to an NH2 group.

246
00:14:53,554 --> 00:14:58,733
So for the resonances, 
the further away that we are from here,

247
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:01,072
the more similar they are.

248
00:15:01,072 --> 00:15:04,023
So we have glutamine, 
glutamate here, fairly similar.

249
00:15:04,023 --> 00:15:06,285
Here it's almost the same chemical shift

250
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:11,594
but in this group which is the closest 
to the carboxyl-terminal here

251
00:15:11,594 --> 00:15:14,765
is the biggest chemical shift 
at this position.

252
00:15:14,765 --> 00:15:16,932
That has to do with chemical proximity

253
00:15:16,932 --> 00:15:20,427
and the change in 
the electron cloud configuration.

254
00:15:20,427 --> 00:15:23,636
Last example here is lactate.

255
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:28,313
We have the methyl peak here,
and the CH group is here.

256
00:15:28,313 --> 00:15:30,688
Here's the molecule methyl peak here,

257
00:15:30,688 --> 00:15:32,430
and the CH group is here.

258
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:34,766
And we see, very nicely, the doublet here

259
00:15:34,766 --> 00:15:37,650
that tells us that 
there's a CH group nearby.

260
00:15:39,090 --> 00:15:41,739
For measuring these concentrations,

261
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:47,029
one measures an in vivo spectrum

262
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:51,470
fixed with the model spectra 
obtained under in vivo conditions

263
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:54,929
and this way allows us to deconvolute
the number of concentrations

264
00:15:54,929 --> 00:16:00,540
and measure, therefore, up to 20 different
neurochemical compounds in vivo.

265
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,965
So here I want to give an example 
of metabolic phenotyping

266
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:08,173
of transgenic animals.

267
00:16:08,173 --> 00:16:11,062
This is a historical study here.

268
00:16:12,342 --> 00:16:14,901
What one was looking at
is wild-type animals

269
00:16:14,901 --> 00:16:17,522
and transgenic animals 
for Huntington's disease,

270
00:16:17,522 --> 00:16:21,114
it's a Huntingtin gene knock-in,
the so-called <i>R6/2</i> mouse

271
00:16:21,114 --> 00:16:25,222
and in that particular study,
over seven mice,

272
00:16:25,222 --> 00:16:28,421
what one saw is a difference 
in glutamine levels.

273
00:16:28,421 --> 00:16:33,141
Now the difference 
in absolute terms is not very big

274
00:16:33,141 --> 00:16:36,995
but the measurement with these types 
of analysis can be very precise

275
00:16:36,995 --> 00:16:39,776
so these error bars 
indicate standard deviation

276
00:16:39,776 --> 00:16:43,858
and it was, hence, 
already in the data, clear

277
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:50,298
which animal had an abnormally high
glutamine concentration

278
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:52,608
compared to the others.

279
00:16:54,218 --> 00:16:59,384
Now here I want to show some examples
from the human side.

280
00:16:59,384 --> 00:17:01,920
This is a patient with a brain tumor.

281
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,943
We have some changes 
in the MRI signal here.

282
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:10,169
And now these squares here indicate
where the signal has been taken.

283
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:13,319
Here, this signal 
corresponds to this side,

284
00:17:13,319 --> 00:17:15,848
where the image intensity is abnormal.

285
00:17:15,848 --> 00:17:17,330
And here on the normal side,

286
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:21,352
one sees a normal pattern 
for human patients.

287
00:17:21,352 --> 00:17:24,910
Now the knowledge 
of the biochemical composition

288
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:29,300
of an area in the brain 
is illustrated here, it's advantage.

289
00:17:30,100 --> 00:17:34,142
The changes like these observed in vivo,

290
00:17:34,142 --> 00:17:37,052
they could mean that one has 
necrosis of the tissue,

291
00:17:37,052 --> 00:17:39,102
they could mean neoplastic tissue,

292
00:17:39,102 --> 00:17:42,842
they could also be consistent with edema.

293
00:17:42,842 --> 00:17:44,913
So there are a lot of cellular processes

294
00:17:44,913 --> 00:17:49,876
that influence the relaxation 
of water in the tissue.

295
00:17:49,876 --> 00:17:52,011
However, the biochemical information here

296
00:17:52,011 --> 00:17:54,362
which tells us that N-acetyl-aspartate

297
00:17:54,362 --> 00:17:56,275
is essentially not present in this area

298
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:59,215
and there's a lot of 
choline-containing compounds,

299
00:17:59,215 --> 00:18:04,464
implies that this is indeed, 
to a large extent, tumorous tissue.

300
00:18:06,714 --> 00:18:11,235
In the muscle physiology, which has been
an interesting area of application--

301
00:18:13,565 --> 00:18:15,646
this is a muscle here.

302
00:18:15,646 --> 00:18:19,345
The proton spectroscopy is taken here

303
00:18:19,345 --> 00:18:21,416
and here's the phosphorus spectroscopy,

304
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:27,507
a lot of phosphocreatine relative to ATP,
characteristic of skeletal muscle.

305
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:31,747
Now what is interesting here
is for the proton spectra

306
00:18:31,747 --> 00:18:34,617
the fat signal is split into a signal
that is attributed

307
00:18:34,617 --> 00:18:40,138
to intramyocellular lipid
and extramyocellular lipid.

308
00:18:40,138 --> 00:18:44,658
The intramyocellular lipid 
is fat that's contained in vesicles

309
00:18:44,658 --> 00:18:48,194
that are bound to the mitochondria.

310
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:51,279
This fat is what is being used 
for a marathon run.

311
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:53,930
The extramyocellular fat, 
this signal here,

312
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,355
is attributed to the white inclusion,

313
00:18:57,355 --> 00:18:59,376
so when you eat a steak 
you see the white stuff,

314
00:18:59,376 --> 00:19:02,909
that's the EMCL: extramyocellular lipid.

315
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:05,865
The reason those two are distinguishable,

316
00:19:05,865 --> 00:19:09,267
research at the University of Bern
have very nicely demonstrated

317
00:19:09,267 --> 00:19:12,917
it has to do with
the magnetic field susceptibility,

318
00:19:12,917 --> 00:19:16,746
the magnetic field is slightly different
between these two environments.

319
00:19:18,676 --> 00:19:20,332
I'll show one last example.

320
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:23,925
This is proton spectroscopy 
of the mouse brain.

321
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:27,872
This is a tumor in a mouse.

322
00:19:27,872 --> 00:19:33,273
Here is the normal appearing spectrum
and here is the side of the tumor.

323
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:37,843
Now there are a lot of specific
and detailed changes going on

324
00:19:37,843 --> 00:19:41,043
but in terms of seeing that 
there's something major going on

325
00:19:41,043 --> 00:19:44,586
with the biochemistry, 
we don't have to be magicians,

326
00:19:44,586 --> 00:19:47,276
this is fairly obvious 
that this is clearly different

327
00:19:47,276 --> 00:19:50,455
from what we see in the normal case.

328
00:19:51,885 --> 00:19:55,615
And here's an example 
of a mouse model of stroke.

329
00:19:55,615 --> 00:19:59,585
We have the normal proton spectrum here

330
00:19:59,585 --> 00:20:03,396
of a region that has not been 
subjected to stroke

331
00:20:03,396 --> 00:20:05,856
or before they've been 
subjected to stroke.

332
00:20:05,856 --> 00:20:08,111
And then three hours after the stroke

333
00:20:08,111 --> 00:20:10,878
one observes an increase 
in the glutamine signal

334
00:20:10,878 --> 00:20:13,349
and a decrease in the glutamate signal.

335
00:20:13,349 --> 00:20:16,198
Now, again, this is of course subjected 
to the type of analysis

336
00:20:16,198 --> 00:20:18,085
that I've illustrated before.

337
00:20:18,085 --> 00:20:22,547
But visually we can clearly see 
that this peak here has gone up

338
00:20:22,547 --> 00:20:24,369
and this one has gone down 
in relative terms

339
00:20:24,369 --> 00:20:28,078
so there is something going on 
in this area here.

340
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:32,069
And glutamine and glutamate share 
an important metabolic relationship

341
00:20:32,069 --> 00:20:35,640
in mediating neurotransmission.

342
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:40,421
So this concludes the examples 
of NMR spectroscopy for this week.

343
00:20:40,421 --> 00:20:44,573
And next week we will discuss

344
00:20:44,573 --> 00:20:49,076
how in MRI one can reconstruct an image.
