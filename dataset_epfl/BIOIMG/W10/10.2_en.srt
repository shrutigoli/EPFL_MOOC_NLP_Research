1
00:00:04,168 --> 00:00:06,315
Now we have introduced magnetic resonance

2
00:00:06,315 --> 00:00:08,665
as a very insensitive technique.

3
00:00:08,665 --> 00:00:11,236
We are limited by 
the equilibrium magnetization,

4
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:14,061
which is limited by 
the Boltzmann distribution,

5
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:18,324
and we have clearly established 
that this technique is not suitable

6
00:00:18,324 --> 00:00:22,005
for detecting the signal 
from just a few molecules.

7
00:00:22,005 --> 00:00:26,878
But we have to get a decent signal
to be able to measure it.

8
00:00:26,878 --> 00:00:30,300
And this is typically done
by the approach of averaging.

9
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,419
So multiple acquisitions 
are being acquired,

10
00:00:34,419 --> 00:00:37,619
be it for spectroscopy, for NMR,

11
00:00:37,619 --> 00:00:41,750
be it for MRI, this is generally the case.

12
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,128
So what one does is one applies

13
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:46,940
the same experiment over and over again,

14
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:52,901
by averaging obtains a sensitivity,
an SNR that is increased.

15
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:58,943
So we have the situation in this case,
that RF pulse is, or flip angle <i>α,</i>

16
00:00:58,943 --> 00:01:03,214
are applied every <i>TR</i> seconds,
and they're applied this <i>n</i> times.

17
00:01:03,844 --> 00:01:07,794
And now the question is at what point,
under what conditions

18
00:01:07,794 --> 00:01:09,653
is the transverse magnetization,

19
00:01:09,653 --> 00:01:13,022
which is proportional
to the signal, maximal?

20
00:01:13,882 --> 00:01:17,734
So we have two parameters.

21
00:01:17,734 --> 00:01:21,509
We have the flip angle <i>α</i>
and the repetition time <i>TR.</i>

22
00:01:22,269 --> 00:01:27,145
And what one now is interested
is calculating the flip angle <i>α</i>

23
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:29,126
as a function of <i>TR.</i>

24
00:01:29,126 --> 00:01:31,867
It is clear that if one waits so long

25
00:01:31,867 --> 00:01:36,247
that one has equilibrium magnetization,

26
00:01:36,247 --> 00:01:40,578
so 5 times <i>T1, </i>
<i>e^-5</i> is equal to 0.01,

27
00:01:40,578 --> 00:01:43,248
5 times <i>T1</i> gives us 
the equilibrium magnetization.

28
00:01:43,248 --> 00:01:45,963
At that point, the optimal 
flip angle is 90 degrees.

29
00:01:46,213 --> 00:01:49,433
However, if our <i>TR</i> is very short,

30
00:01:49,433 --> 00:01:52,564
and we always apply 
a 90-degree flip angle,

31
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:56,785
then we will not get any signal,
we've seen already at the beginning.

32
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:01,391
At the end of last week's course
we have seen an example thereof

33
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:03,231
where we get no signal.

34
00:02:04,271 --> 00:02:05,860
So this is the strategy here.

35
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:08,202
We want to figure out 
what is the good choice

36
00:02:08,202 --> 00:02:11,231
of the flip angle as a function of <i>TR.</i>

37
00:02:12,581 --> 00:02:14,732
So here is the experiment.

38
00:02:14,732 --> 00:02:18,151
We have an RF pulse flip angle <i>α.</i>

39
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:19,961
We detect the signal.

40
00:02:19,961 --> 00:02:22,602
We have the RF pulse <i>α</i> applied again.

41
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:26,451
We detect the signal here again,
and we'll call here this signal

42
00:02:26,451 --> 00:02:28,353
at the beginning of this second RF pulse,

43
00:02:28,353 --> 00:02:30,654
we'll call this <i>M</i>
the transverse magnetization

44
00:02:30,654 --> 00:02:35,113
at time zero, that is our signal 
that we wish to optimize.

45
00:02:37,503 --> 00:02:41,785
This time here is equal to <i>TR,</i>
we'll call this <i>TR.</i>

46
00:02:44,595 --> 00:02:48,795
And now we will assume that before 
the application of the RF pulse,

47
00:02:48,795 --> 00:02:54,038
any transverse magnetization 
has decayed away in the time of <i>TR</i> second.

48
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:57,187
This is usually a good approximation

49
00:02:57,187 --> 00:02:59,458
and it shall suffice 
for the calculation here.

50
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:02,685
So we'll assume that 
we have no transverse magnetization

51
00:03:02,685 --> 00:03:06,970
and we just have magnetization 
along z at this time point.

52
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:11,178
So our z magnetization 
has a function of time here,

53
00:03:11,178 --> 00:03:14,980
this is again, the general solution
of the differential equation

54
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,470
for the z component,

55
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,378
is given by this term here,

56
00:03:19,378 --> 00:03:22,088
which describes return 
to equilibrium magnetization,

57
00:03:22,088 --> 00:03:26,508
and this term here, which describes
longitudinal coherence.

58
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:31,962
Now let's assume that we are doing 
a number of these <i>α</i> degree pulses.

59
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:36,369
Can be a thousand, ten thousand,
a few hundred, or so on.

60
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:41,992
And after these RF pulses and the <i>nth TR,</i>

61
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:47,473
so let's say, we have done 100 <i>TR</i> periods,

62
00:03:47,473 --> 00:03:53,334
100 RF pulses followed by 100 <i>TR</i> periods,

63
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:57,384
we have a z magnetization at that point
and we'll call that <i>Mz(n).</i>

64
00:03:58,134 --> 00:04:01,505
So at 100 or 1000, 
doesn't matter what the <i>n</i> is,

65
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:03,154
it has to be sufficiently big.

66
00:04:03,154 --> 00:04:06,166
In practice, it's actually 3 to 5, 
is already sufficient,

67
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,576
but we'll see that later.

68
00:04:07,576 --> 00:04:09,125
So we'll call this magnetization here,

69
00:04:09,125 --> 00:04:14,396
just before this RF pulse 
after <i>n</i> TR periods,

70
00:04:14,926 --> 00:04:19,651
<i>n</i> applications of <i>α</i> RF pulses 
and TR periods, <i>Mz(n).</i>

71
00:04:21,351 --> 00:04:26,467
Now a flip angle <i>α</i> is applied
and so the <i>Mz</i> at time zero,

72
00:04:27,027 --> 00:04:29,558
that is the z magnetization 
here at this time,

73
00:04:29,558 --> 00:04:30,759
that would be here,

74
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,640
is given by <i>Mz</i> before the RF pulse 
times <i>cosine α.</i>

75
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:36,849
We've already seen that relationship,

76
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:41,310
that's the magnetization that's left
after a flip angle of <i>α.</i>

77
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:46,619
Now during this period, 
we'll consider the <i>T1</i> recovery.

78
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:50,712
So <i>Mz(n + 1)</i> is equal to this term here.

79
00:04:50,712 --> 00:04:53,191
That's essentially using 
this equation here,

80
00:04:53,191 --> 00:04:59,502
by substituting <i>Mz(n)</i> here,
times <i>cosine α,</i> as <i>Mz(0).</i>

81
00:04:59,502 --> 00:05:02,343
So we'll take this term, 
substituting this equation,

82
00:05:02,343 --> 00:05:04,523
we have the terms rearranged here

83
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:08,090
so that the exponential term
is on this side.

84
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:15,613
And so this <i>Mz(n + 1),</i>
that's the z magnetization

85
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:19,033
just before the second RF pulse
here in this scheme,

86
00:05:19,033 --> 00:05:21,024
and I've regrouped the terms here

87
00:05:21,024 --> 00:05:24,584
and we have <i>M0,</i> the return to equilibrium,

88
00:05:24,584 --> 00:05:27,107
and here's the longitudinal 
coherence term.

89
00:05:28,357 --> 00:05:31,868
Now we're going to apply
a steady-state condition.

90
00:05:31,868 --> 00:05:37,586
We're going to assume 
that a sufficient number, <i>small n,</i>

91
00:05:37,586 --> 00:05:41,018
of RF pulses and TR periods,
has been applied

92
00:05:41,018 --> 00:05:47,389
so that the <i>Mz(n + 1)</i>
and the <i>Mz(n),</i> are equal.

93
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:51,139
We can assume that 
this happens at some point.

94
00:05:51,139 --> 00:05:54,451
At some point it will always recover
to the same z magnetization

95
00:05:54,451 --> 00:05:56,719
and then we will call this magnetization

96
00:05:56,719 --> 00:06:01,192
equals <i>Mz(n + 1)</i>
and we'll just call it <i>Mz.</i>

97
00:06:02,632 --> 00:06:05,130
So we have now here <i>Mz(n + 1),</i>

98
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,961
here we have <i>Mz(n).</i>

99
00:06:06,961 --> 00:06:10,653
After <i>n</i> periods we'll now assume
that these two are equal,

100
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:13,255
so we'll set them equal, 
I've done this here,

101
00:06:13,255 --> 00:06:16,841
and we'll put the terms 
that contain <i>Mz</i> on the left side,

102
00:06:16,841 --> 00:06:21,183
and we're left with the terms
that contain <i>M0</i> on the right side.

103
00:06:22,443 --> 00:06:25,822
And so we can now express 
the z magnetization

104
00:06:26,872 --> 00:06:29,232
as a function of 
the equilibrium magnetization,

105
00:06:29,232 --> 00:06:32,903
as a function of the time 
between RF pulses, the repetition time,

106
00:06:32,903 --> 00:06:37,094
and as a function of the flip angle here,
the <i>cosine α</i> term.

107
00:06:38,494 --> 00:06:40,455
Now this is not yet our signal.

108
00:06:40,455 --> 00:06:43,914
This is just the equilibrium 
z magnetization that we have

109
00:06:43,914 --> 00:06:46,518
just before this RF pulse here,

110
00:06:46,518 --> 00:06:50,647
so we are now interested in 
the equilibrium transverse magnetization

111
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:53,847
because it gives us 
the signal that we obtain.

112
00:06:53,847 --> 00:06:57,633
So the transverse magnetization here,
after this RF pulse

113
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:00,990
is equal to the z magnetization 
before the RF pulse

114
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:03,494
times <i>sine α.</i>

115
00:07:03,494 --> 00:07:06,159
We'll set this in and now we have

116
00:07:06,159 --> 00:07:09,230
the equilibrium magnetization 
equation here.

117
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:12,780
So that's our transverse magnetization
at equilibrium

118
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:17,820
is proportional to <i>M0,</i>
is influenced by the flip angle,

119
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:21,879
and influenced by the <i>TR/T1.</i>

120
00:07:22,649 --> 00:07:29,580
And so we have now <i>TR/T1</i> on one side,
and the flip angle <i>α</i>

121
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,992
that influences this 
equilibrium magnetization.

122
00:07:32,992 --> 00:07:35,692
This is a fairly fundamental equation here

123
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:38,992
that describes
the influence of the signal

124
00:07:38,992 --> 00:07:44,424
as a function of flip angle
and time between RF pulses.

125
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:49,670
So now comes the question,
this was a fairly complicated equation,

126
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,623
and the question is, 
how does a signal depend on TR,

127
00:07:53,623 --> 00:07:55,165
time between RF pulses,

128
00:07:55,165 --> 00:07:59,415
T1, the T1 relaxation, 
and the flip angle <i>α?</i>

129
00:08:00,805 --> 00:08:04,206
So if you plot the signal 
versus flip angle <i>α,</i>

130
00:08:04,206 --> 00:08:08,466
and here I'm showing this equation again

131
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:10,776
that we just derived 
on the previous slide.

132
00:08:10,776 --> 00:08:12,927
This is the same expression here,

133
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,248
and now let's look at what we observe.

134
00:08:15,248 --> 00:08:19,538
So if <i>TR/T1</i> is 10, 
<i>e^-10</i> is essentially zero.

135
00:08:19,538 --> 00:08:23,329
So we have this is <i>M0 sine α</i>
divided by 1.

136
00:08:23,329 --> 00:08:27,699
So we have <i>M0 sine α,</i>
so our signal describes very nicely

137
00:08:27,699 --> 00:08:31,048
a sinusoidal function here.

138
00:08:31,048 --> 00:08:34,441
And the maximum is at 90 degrees, 
not surprisingly.

139
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:39,821
Even for <i>TR/T1</i> equals 5,
here <i>e^-5</i> is 0.01,

140
00:08:39,821 --> 00:08:42,169
we get essentially the same behavior.

141
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:44,238
So this is not surprising.

142
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:48,253
Then as we see, if we plot this function
here for different <i>TR/T1's,</i>

143
00:08:48,253 --> 00:08:51,241
as <i>TR/T1</i> gets smaller and smaller,

144
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:52,855
then we can see that the maximum

145
00:08:52,855 --> 00:08:55,962
shifts further and further 
away from 90 degrees.

146
00:08:57,232 --> 00:09:01,682
So here's this function plotted
and I've tried to, with this dashed line,

147
00:09:01,682 --> 00:09:05,084
indicate where the maximum 
of the flip angle is.

148
00:09:05,084 --> 00:09:07,543
So at what choice of flip angle do we get

149
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:09,993
the maximum transverse magnetization?

150
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:13,574
And here it's expressed normalized to <i>M0.</i>

151
00:09:15,274 --> 00:09:18,365
So if you look now at this flip angle,

152
00:09:19,135 --> 00:09:22,355
so we want to calculate 
the transverse magnetization,

153
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:24,117
which is our signal,

154
00:09:24,117 --> 00:09:29,225
at what flip angle <i>α</i>
is the maximum obtained?

155
00:09:29,225 --> 00:09:31,074
And this is done by taking the derivative

156
00:09:31,074 --> 00:09:33,458
of the transverse magnetization
of this expression,

157
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:36,758
with respect to the flip angle,
and setting it to zero.

158
00:09:37,128 --> 00:09:39,108
I will spare you the math of doing this.

159
00:09:39,108 --> 00:09:44,106
This is a simple cumbersome exercise
of multiple calculations.

160
00:09:44,696 --> 00:09:46,807
We'll just take the derivative 
of this term here,

161
00:09:46,807 --> 00:09:49,458
with respect to <i>α</i>
and I'll give you the solution here,

162
00:09:49,458 --> 00:09:55,579
which is <i>cosine α</i> is equal <i>e^-TR/T1,</i>

163
00:09:57,019 --> 00:10:00,231
where <i>α</i> is called the <i>Ernst Angle.</i>

164
00:10:00,841 --> 00:10:04,549
So if we plot this now, we have the <i>TR/T1,</i>

165
00:10:04,549 --> 00:10:07,341
and notice here the logarithmic scale,

166
00:10:07,811 --> 00:10:09,391
the angle here in degrees.

167
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:14,332
We have at a very high <i>TR/T1,</i>
we have the not surprising 90 degrees,

168
00:10:14,332 --> 00:10:17,132
and as the <i>TR/T1</i> gets shorter and shorter,

169
00:10:17,132 --> 00:10:19,931
this asymptotically goes to zero.

170
00:10:19,931 --> 00:10:26,343
Of course, if <i>TR/T1</i> goes to zero,
then <i>cosine α</i> goes to 1,

171
00:10:26,343 --> 00:10:29,703
that is a zero-degree flip angle.

172
00:10:30,063 --> 00:10:32,862
And this optimal flip angle is called
the Ernst Angle.

173
00:10:32,862 --> 00:10:36,760
It's been named after Richard Ernst,
a physical chemist from Zurich,

174
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:40,627
who received for his work, 
among also this work,

175
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:45,304
he received the Nobel Prize 
in Chemistry in 1991.
