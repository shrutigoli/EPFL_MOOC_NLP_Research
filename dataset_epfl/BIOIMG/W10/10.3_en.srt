1
00:00:04,633 --> 00:00:08,494
Okay, now we're talking about 
nuclear magnetic resonance here.

2
00:00:08,494 --> 00:00:13,432
We're talking about a nuclear property,
so how can we from a nuclear property

3
00:00:13,432 --> 00:00:15,633
deduce chemical information?

4
00:00:16,118 --> 00:00:19,751
And the question is,
how does chemical environment

5
00:00:19,751 --> 00:00:23,909
influence the nuclear
magnetic resonance effect?

6
00:00:24,496 --> 00:00:30,665
So let's start out with the nucleus 
of the proton of the hydrogen atom H1,

7
00:00:30,665 --> 00:00:31,996
that's the proton.

8
00:00:31,996 --> 00:00:33,826
That's a single lone proton.

9
00:00:34,084 --> 00:00:38,224
This proton typically if you take
a isolated hydrogen atom is

10
00:00:38,224 --> 00:00:40,994
surrounded by an electron,
so there's an electron cloud

11
00:00:40,994 --> 00:00:46,094
surrounding that nucleus here,
and it's nice and symmetric.

12
00:00:46,674 --> 00:00:50,555
For the resonance frequency 
of the pure proton,

13
00:00:50,555 --> 00:00:53,574
that is the procession frequency,
we have the Larmor frequency,

14
00:00:53,574 --> 00:00:57,624
which is <i>gamma (𝛄) B zero</i>
so that is the Larmor frequency

15
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:00,455
that we have dealt with so far.

16
00:01:01,925 --> 00:01:08,078
Now if we have our hydrogen atom
in a magnetic field <i>B zero</i>

17
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:12,771
what now happens is a distortion,
a very small distortion

18
00:01:12,771 --> 00:01:14,319
of the electron cloud.

19
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,700
I will not go into the details
of the quantum mechanical explanation

20
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:22,598
of how this electron cloud is distorted
but you can rationalize this

21
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:28,179
simply by the fact that the electron
which swirls around the nucleus

22
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:32,750
around the proton, that electron,
its flight pattern is most likely

23
00:01:32,750 --> 00:01:36,430
influenced by the presence 
of an external magnetic field.

24
00:01:36,821 --> 00:01:41,030
Think of it this way, if it happens 
to fly parallel to be zero,

25
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:45,847
there's no influence of the magnetic field
if it flies perpendicular to <i>B zero</i>

26
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:47,810
there's a maximal influence.

27
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,711
What the consequence of this is 
that the electron cloud is deformed,

28
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:58,650
it changes ever so slightly its shape.

29
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:02,870
As a result of that, 
a small magnetic field

30
00:02:02,870 --> 00:02:06,230
due to the electron is being introduced.

31
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:10,339
This magnetic field, 
we'll call it here <i>delta (Δ) B</i>,

32
00:02:10,339 --> 00:02:13,691
this magnetic field is proportioned
to <i>B zero</i> with proportionality

33
00:02:13,809 --> 00:02:15,978
constant Δ here.

34
00:02:16,838 --> 00:02:20,919
So the presence of the electron 
around the nucleus in the magnetic field

35
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:25,470
leads to an alteration
of the magnetic field at the site

36
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:26,679
of the nucleus.

37
00:02:27,648 --> 00:02:33,275
So this small change 
in the magnetic field <i>B zero</i>

38
00:02:33,275 --> 00:02:37,715
at the position of the proton
leads to a multifield expression

39
00:02:37,715 --> 00:02:39,314
for the procession.

40
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:42,494
Here's the Larmor equation
and now we don't have <i>𝛄 B zero</i>

41
00:02:42,494 --> 00:02:45,465
but we have <i>𝛄 (1 + Δ )</i>

42
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:50,996
That is the equation of motion 
that describes the behavior

43
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:55,859
of the magnetization and as a consequence,
the Larmor frequency is now

44
00:02:55,859 --> 00:03:02,492
the procession frequency
which is <i> 𝛄 B zero</i> times this

45
00:03:02,492 --> 00:03:07,621
is now changed and is given
by the Larmor frequency times <i>(1 + Δ)</i>.

46
00:03:08,318 --> 00:03:12,437
And this Δ is called the chemical shift,
short for chemical shift

47
00:03:12,437 --> 00:03:14,657
of the Larmor frequency.

48
00:03:15,797 --> 00:03:20,488
The sign here is not important
for the further understanding

49
00:03:20,488 --> 00:03:23,497
whether we put a +Δ or - Δ.

50
00:03:23,497 --> 00:03:27,388
What is important here is
that based on the presence

51
00:03:27,388 --> 00:03:32,167
of the electron, the proton
magnetization will no longer process

52
00:03:32,167 --> 00:03:34,938
exactly at the Larmor frequency.

53
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:41,517
Now let's think about if we have
this hydrogen atom close to a nearby

54
00:03:41,517 --> 00:03:45,977
electronegative atom 
such as oxygen or chloride.

55
00:03:45,977 --> 00:03:49,978
These electronegative atoms attract
the electrons.

56
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:54,288
They produce therefore a reduced
electron density at the site

57
00:03:54,288 --> 00:04:00,446
of the proton and therefore
a so-called deshielding

58
00:04:00,446 --> 00:04:04,909
of the nearby hydrogen nuclei 
of the protons.

59
00:04:05,386 --> 00:04:09,342
That means we have less 
of an effect of the electrons

60
00:04:09,342 --> 00:04:11,920
on the resonance frequency.

61
00:04:13,268 --> 00:04:15,778
So I'll illustrate this here
with an example.

62
00:04:15,778 --> 00:04:19,498
First we'll take the normal 
hydrogen isolated hydrogen atom.

63
00:04:19,498 --> 00:04:21,320
Here's the hydrogen electron.

64
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,208
Everything is as we have described here.

65
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:29,800
If we now have nearby an oxygen
so we'll look at a hydrogen nucleus

66
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,920
in a OH, which is part 
of an OH bond,

67
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,619
we have the electronegative oxygen
and now for convenience I have drawn

68
00:04:38,619 --> 00:04:45,042
a simplified distribution
of the electron cloud that belongs

69
00:04:45,042 --> 00:04:46,737
to the hydrogen atom.

70
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:50,114
And essentially because 
oxygen's electronegative,

71
00:04:50,114 --> 00:04:54,884
the probability that the electron
is swirling around the hydrogen

72
00:04:54,884 --> 00:04:59,049
is much reduced and most 
of the electron is actually at the site

73
00:04:59,049 --> 00:05:00,468
of the oxygen.

74
00:05:01,639 --> 00:05:04,679
So what this means now
is if we put the OH group

75
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:08,050
into a magnetic field,
there's little shielding from the electron

76
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:13,780
so there's little modification 
of the magnetic field

77
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,220
at the site of the nucleus 
of the hydrogen atom here

78
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,310
at the proton.

79
00:05:18,549 --> 00:05:20,479
Consider a third example.

80
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,548
This is a CH bond,
so we have the carbon here.

81
00:05:23,788 --> 00:05:28,872
Carbon is less electronegative
so it starts to pull the electron cloud

82
00:05:28,872 --> 00:05:33,888
off the hydrogen electron
over to it but not as much as the OH,

83
00:05:33,888 --> 00:05:35,327
which is here.

84
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:39,708
And so as a result, 
there's a stronger effect

85
00:05:39,708 --> 00:05:44,418
of the presence of the electron
on the changing magnetic fields.

86
00:05:44,418 --> 00:05:47,918
So there's more shielding
and a stronger shielding

87
00:05:47,918 --> 00:05:51,358
of the magnetic field,
this <i>ΔB</i>, this figure.

88
00:05:51,358 --> 00:05:54,328
So as a consequence, 
the resonance frequency

89
00:05:54,328 --> 00:05:59,069
of the nucleus of the hydrogen atom
of the proton is higher in an OH bond

90
00:05:59,069 --> 00:06:01,400
than it is in a CH bond.

91
00:06:02,169 --> 00:06:04,118
So I'll stick 
with this qualitative description

92
00:06:04,118 --> 00:06:07,139
because it helps us
qualitatively understand

93
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:11,348
what's happening,
the strictly quantum mechanical

94
00:06:11,348 --> 00:06:14,469
beneath your calculations
trying to predict based on molecular

95
00:06:14,469 --> 00:06:16,359
[inaudible] of chemical shifts.

96
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:19,869
They are qualitatively very good
but they are not sufficient

97
00:06:19,869 --> 00:06:22,950
in explaining all the details 
that one sees.

98
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:26,610
So we will stick with this qualitative
argument here

99
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,609
that electronegativity, that is
the distribution of the electron clouds

100
00:06:30,609 --> 00:06:34,750
has an influence on the resonance 
frequency, and therefore

101
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:39,138
through the change in resonance frequency
with this nuclear magnetic

102
00:06:39,138 --> 00:06:42,792
resonancy effect, one is able
to sense the chemical environment.

103
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:47,396
So how is this chemical shift 
of the resonance frequency

104
00:06:47,396 --> 00:06:50,992
or chemical shift Δ linked
to electron negativity.

105
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:55,508
And I've taken here a table,
we're looking at compounds CH3X

106
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:58,871
where X is fluoride, oxygen, 
chloride, bromide, iodine, hydrogen

107
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:00,180
or silicone.

108
00:07:00,556 --> 00:07:05,060
In these molecules, one has determined
the electronegativity precisely

109
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,706
and also the chemical shift 
of the proton resonance frequency.

110
00:07:09,706 --> 00:07:12,190
Taking this table 
and plotting electronegativity

111
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:15,552
on the x axis versus 
the chemical shift on the y axis,

112
00:07:15,694 --> 00:07:19,783
we actually see a fairly nice
at least monotonous relationship

113
00:07:19,783 --> 00:07:22,724
between electronegativity 
and chemical shift.

114
00:07:23,047 --> 00:07:25,653
This compound is
a little bit different from the others,

115
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:32,044
but this is a very nice strong correlation
between chemical shift

116
00:07:32,044 --> 00:07:33,879
and electronegativity.

117
00:07:34,596 --> 00:07:38,802
Now chemical shift is not measured 
in Hertz but it's measured

118
00:07:38,802 --> 00:07:40,252
in parts per million.

119
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:45,493
And parts per million here
is not a measure of the number

120
00:07:45,493 --> 00:07:48,521
of molecules present
and it's not an absolute measure.

121
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:53,141
It's actually measured with respect 
to a reference compound.

122
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:57,111
For protons, tetramethylsilane
is one compound or TMS,

123
00:07:57,111 --> 00:08:01,650
and here it is the reference compound
so this is set to zero.

124
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,756
So the exact explanation here is 
the difference of the resonance frequency

125
00:08:05,756 --> 00:08:09,373
observed, relative to that 
of the reference compound,

126
00:08:09,373 --> 00:08:12,273
divided by the frequency 
of the reference compound,

127
00:08:12,273 --> 00:08:16,604
and that typically gives us numbers
that are <i>10 ^ -6</i>

128
00:08:16,604 --> 00:08:20,633
or it's a parts per million effect,
and someone multiplies

129
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:26,006
by <i>10 ^ 6</i> to obtain
a number which is something

130
00:08:26,006 --> 00:08:28,923
in the order of 1 to 10 
or something like that.

131
00:08:28,923 --> 00:08:33,044
it's easier to write 
than constantly having to write <i>10 ^ -6</i>

132
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:35,524
and that's why 
it's parts per million or ppm

133
00:08:35,524 --> 00:08:39,467
because we multiply here by <i>10 ^ 6</i>

134
00:08:40,134 --> 00:08:46,192
So there is no absolute measure here
that this is zero is a convention

135
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,217
where the zero is placed.

136
00:08:48,739 --> 00:08:52,569
What is important here is 
the relative relationship.

137
00:08:52,859 --> 00:08:58,369
And so if one looks at the chemical shift
of protons that's the nuclei of hydrogen

138
00:08:58,369 --> 00:09:02,118
in all sorts of different compounds,
one knows roughly based

139
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:06,433
on the type of chemical bond
in which range the chemical shifts

140
00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:07,724
to appear.

141
00:09:07,724 --> 00:09:14,532
So we will not see this type OOH
with a chemical shift over here.

142
00:09:14,781 --> 00:09:16,840
This is a high chemical shift here.

143
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:20,921
This is all with respect to TMS,
tetramethylsilane.

144
00:09:21,243 --> 00:09:28,054
So at what place in the spectrum,
here the proton spectrum,

145
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:33,316
the resonance frequency is observed
tells us a lot already

146
00:09:33,316 --> 00:09:39,517
about the chemical compound

147
00:09:39,517 --> 00:09:41,737
under investigation.
