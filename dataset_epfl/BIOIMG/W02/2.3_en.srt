1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,006
Now we'll switch gears.

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:09,737
We'll go into the domain
of X-rays, which will be with us

3
00:00:09,737 --> 00:00:14,975
for this second part of the week
of this lecture.

4
00:00:15,724 --> 00:00:21,243
The next week's lecture 
will talk about X-rays interactions.

5
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:23,757
Then we'll talk about computed tomography,

6
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:28,426
and the following weeks
are image and computed tomography.

7
00:00:28,426 --> 00:00:30,527
Now, X-rays are

8
00:00:30,527 --> 00:00:32,918
the beginnings of biomedical imaging.

9
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:35,346
Do you recognize this image?

10
00:00:36,206 --> 00:00:40,697
This is actually taken in 1895
by Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen,

11
00:00:40,697 --> 00:00:43,036
and it is the hand of his wife.

12
00:00:43,036 --> 00:00:45,697
You can see here in the image,

13
00:00:45,697 --> 00:00:48,837
you can see the wedding band of his wife.

14
00:00:50,786 --> 00:00:53,226
So this is Wilhelm Conrad Rontgen,

15
00:00:53,866 --> 00:00:55,557
and it is actually quite befitting,

16
00:00:55,557 --> 00:00:57,516
he received the Nobel Prize in Physics,

17
00:00:57,516 --> 00:01:00,227
the first Nobel Prize in Physics, in 1901.

18
00:01:00,227 --> 00:01:03,037
Now, the first Nobel Prize in Physics,
I find it remarkable,

19
00:01:03,037 --> 00:01:06,228
that this was given to the Father 
of Biomedical Imaging,

20
00:01:06,228 --> 00:01:07,898
Wilhelm Rontgen.

21
00:01:09,404 --> 00:01:13,764
The lab that he's taking these images in--

22
00:01:13,764 --> 00:01:15,545
this image here on the top--

23
00:01:15,545 --> 00:01:21,083
this is his lab where he did 
the development of the X-rays,

24
00:01:21,442 --> 00:01:23,773
the detection of the X-rays 
and the imaging.

25
00:01:24,433 --> 00:01:27,984
Now, if we look at this video here,

26
00:01:27,984 --> 00:01:31,204
this is taken from the Museum
of Modern Art in San Francisco,

27
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:33,048
It's actually more on the arts:

28
00:01:33,048 --> 00:01:36,005
I find it remarkable,
the images that you see here.

29
00:01:36,005 --> 00:01:40,284
We'll start out with the image 
from Rontgen's wife.

30
00:01:41,235 --> 00:01:46,865
Then we'll see a more modern 
X-ray image at higher resolution.

31
00:01:53,205 --> 00:02:00,367
We can see the image of animals,
of a fish, and of an embryo.

32
00:02:00,517 --> 00:02:04,724
I think this is an embryo of a chicken.

33
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:18,505
And finally, do you recognize
the last image?

34
00:02:18,947 --> 00:02:21,682
Look at this image as we zoom through it,

35
00:02:22,353 --> 00:02:23,854
and as we go through it,

36
00:02:23,854 --> 00:02:29,272
you can also see here at the top
you see the safety pin.

37
00:02:29,903 --> 00:02:32,633
At the bottom you can see 
the foot inside a shoe.

38
00:02:32,633 --> 00:02:34,093
You see the nails of the shoe,

39
00:02:34,288 --> 00:02:36,119
the places for the laces--

40
00:02:36,119 --> 00:02:38,288
the laces you don't see,
but the metal there,

41
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:40,131
that depicts very nicely.

42
00:02:40,509 --> 00:02:45,658
So X-rays were actually used 
very artistically to depict objects,

43
00:02:45,658 --> 00:02:49,489
and in the 50s, the shoemakers,
they were actually so excited

44
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:53,738
about X-ray imaging
that in most shoe stores,

45
00:02:53,738 --> 00:02:57,137
you could actually put your foot
in the shoe that you were about to buy

46
00:02:57,137 --> 00:02:58,828
into an X-ray machine,

47
00:02:58,828 --> 00:03:03,238
and see whether your foot 
fits into the shoe.

48
00:03:03,238 --> 00:03:06,317
You could actually see your toes, etc.

49
00:03:06,317 --> 00:03:07,637
This was very exciting.

50
00:03:07,637 --> 00:03:09,043
People were very excited.

51
00:03:09,043 --> 00:03:11,608
Of course, over the years,
they started to become concerned

52
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:14,727
about the use of X-rays
and the health issues,

53
00:03:14,727 --> 00:03:18,608
as we will discuss next week
the health considerations.

54
00:03:18,939 --> 00:03:22,458
So this was not the ideal use of X-rays

55
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:25,317
but nonetheless very popular at the time.

56
00:03:26,859 --> 00:03:29,688
Now we'll talk about the basis 
of X-ray imaging, and actually,

57
00:03:29,688 --> 00:03:33,609
X-ray imaging is nothing but a part
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

58
00:03:33,609 --> 00:03:36,337
And here is a display 
of the magnetic spectrum.

59
00:03:36,348 --> 00:03:38,948
We have wave length, electron volts--

60
00:03:39,107 --> 00:03:42,185
that is a unit that is frequently used
we will be using here

61
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:43,857
for the first part of the lecture--

62
00:03:43,857 --> 00:03:50,105
and the frequency 
of the different objects we have,

63
00:03:50,357 --> 00:03:54,127
the wavelength, the representation
of objects with the wavelength,

64
00:03:54,127 --> 00:03:55,798
and the frequency here,

65
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:59,305
and the energy of the photons
that are involved.

66
00:04:01,166 --> 00:04:02,897
We have on the lower range,

67
00:04:02,897 --> 00:04:04,994
we have ultrasound imaging.

68
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,706
We have discussed that already today.

69
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:12,578
We have magnetic resonance imaging
also working in the low frequency,

70
00:04:12,578 --> 00:04:16,108
low wavelength, long wavelength regime.

71
00:04:16,776 --> 00:04:18,538
We have medical X-rays.

72
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:24,008
They are in this area here,
and we have positron emission tomography

73
00:04:24,008 --> 00:04:28,509
at the high end of the photon energy
studies short wavelengths

74
00:04:28,509 --> 00:04:30,197
that are over here.

75
00:04:30,197 --> 00:04:33,429
So you can see the techniques 
that we're discussing here in this course

76
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:36,940
range from relatively 
long wavelengths, ultrasound

77
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,934
to very short wavelengths
and high photon energies

78
00:04:40,934 --> 00:04:43,637
for positron emission tomography.

79
00:04:44,259 --> 00:04:47,827
Now, I want to introduce here
some very important relationships

80
00:04:47,827 --> 00:04:49,748
that are useful.

81
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:55,112
So we have the wave equation,
that is the wave speed of light,

82
00:04:55,112 --> 00:05:00,099
<i>3 x 10^8 m/s</i> is equal 
to the wavelength times the frequency.

83
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:04,269
We have the energy of the photon,
which is equal to <i>h𝛎</i>,

84
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:07,029
<i>h</i> being Planck's constant,
<i>𝛎</i> the frequency.

85
00:05:07,898 --> 00:05:13,289
<i>h</i> is even in Joule seconds,
that's the value of <i>h</i>.

86
00:05:13,558 --> 00:05:20,308
We can express this in kiloelectron volts
is <i>4 x 10^-18 keVs</i>.

87
00:05:20,308 --> 00:05:24,722
An electron volt is essentially
the electron that the energy

88
00:05:24,722 --> 00:05:28,838
of an electron acquired 
in an electric field of 1 volt.

89
00:05:30,439 --> 00:05:35,049
We can re-express the energy 
of the photon as the Planck's constant

90
00:05:35,049 --> 00:05:38,037
times the speed of light divided 
by the wavelength,

91
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:40,559
and if we express the wavelength 
in nanometers

92
00:05:40,559 --> 00:05:43,649
and the energy in kiloelectron volts,

93
00:05:43,649 --> 00:05:45,185
then this is easy to remember.

94
00:05:45,185 --> 00:05:48,789
This is 1.2 keV per nanometer.

95
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:56,468
So if we have a wavelength 
of 1 nanometer,

96
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,159
then we have 1.2 keV of energy.

97
00:06:01,922 --> 00:06:09,184
So now, we're looking at the interaction
of electromagnetic radiation with tissue.

98
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:14,541
So matter here, but we'll basically
talk about the interaction with matter.

99
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:17,469
What are the elements 
that we have in matter

100
00:06:17,469 --> 00:06:22,523
that electromagnetic radiation
can interact?

101
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:24,550
And this is basically, 
we've got the nucleus,

102
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,370
and we've got the electrons.

103
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:29,570
Now, in imaging, we are mainly 
concerned with interaction

104
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,921
between X-rays and electrons.

105
00:06:32,493 --> 00:06:35,974
And here it's very useful 
to look at the structure of the atom.

106
00:06:35,974 --> 00:06:40,862
We know very well that the electrons
have a binding energy

107
00:06:40,862 --> 00:06:45,294
that is associated to where they are
in the molecule.

108
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:48,634
So we have the <i>K</i> shell,
which is here at the bottom,

109
00:06:48,634 --> 00:06:54,566
binding energy for tungsten,
here is about -70 keV.

110
00:06:56,222 --> 00:07:00,844
So this is the strongest 
binding energy here,

111
00:07:00,844 --> 00:07:05,765
and then we have different levels
at which the electrons can be bound.

112
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:09,242
They are discreet levels
that come from quantum mechanics.

113
00:07:10,845 --> 00:07:12,335
This makes sense

114
00:07:12,335 --> 00:07:15,344
because the binding energy
decreases with shell distance.

115
00:07:15,344 --> 00:07:16,725
This makes sense

116
00:07:17,325 --> 00:07:23,015
so we have the M-shell here
which is -2.5 keV.

117
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:27,274
It decreases with shell distance
so we can make relationship

118
00:07:27,274 --> 00:07:28,885
to the Coulomb interaction.

119
00:07:28,885 --> 00:07:30,692
The nucleus is positive.

120
00:07:30,702 --> 00:07:35,202
The electron is negative,
so it's attracted to the nucleus,

121
00:07:35,202 --> 00:07:38,478
the further away it is,
it decreases <i>1 / Ar^2</i>

122
00:07:38,478 --> 00:07:42,847
so we have a decrease with the shell 
distance relative to the nucleus.

123
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,645
If we take hydrogen here,
the K-shell binding energy

124
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:49,915
is now only 13 eV.

125
00:07:50,439 --> 00:07:51,861
So it's much lower.

126
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:55,250
This is the closest 
an electron can be to the nucleus.

127
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,982
It's in the K-shell.

128
00:07:57,492 --> 00:08:02,115
So the binding energy increases
with <i>𝚭</i>, that is the number

129
00:08:02,115 --> 00:08:03,741
of protons in the atom.

130
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:07,741
So why does this increase with <i>𝚭</i>?

131
00:08:07,741 --> 00:08:09,351
This is again with Coulomb,

132
00:08:09,351 --> 00:08:14,440
the interaction that is the force
increases with the electrical charge,

133
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,850
it's multiplication 
of the two electrical charges.

134
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:21,001
The electron is alway one electron charge
and the positive charge

135
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:24,011
is the number protons 
that is proportionate to <i>𝚭</i>.

136
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:26,240
So it increases with <i>𝚭</i>.

137
00:08:26,261 --> 00:08:29,022
That also makes.
just from a classical consideration,

138
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:31,012
makes perfect sense.

139
00:08:32,183 --> 00:08:34,802
So if you now look at the lowest 
K-shell binding energy

140
00:08:34,802 --> 00:08:36,222
that we have out there

141
00:08:36,222 --> 00:08:39,973
from the periodic table of elements,

142
00:08:39,973 --> 00:08:42,821
the lowest binding K-shell 
energy that we have

143
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,362
is for the hydrogen atom.

144
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:47,749
It is 13.6 eV.

145
00:08:48,043 --> 00:08:50,736
And here we make 
an important classification.

146
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:54,420
If the photon energy,
<i>h x 𝛎 </i> is bigger than this--

147
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:57,796
than the K-shell binding energy 
for the hydrogen,

148
00:08:57,796 --> 00:09:02,074
than we consider the radiation
as ionizing,

149
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:05,762
and if it's below that,
the radiation is non-ionizing.

150
00:09:05,762 --> 00:09:09,114
Ionizing means that the photon
has sufficient energy

151
00:09:09,114 --> 00:09:12,202
that is able to bump the electron
out of the K-shell,

152
00:09:12,202 --> 00:09:20,217
and therefore, produce a charged atom
and therefore, arises the term ionizing.

153
00:09:21,393 --> 00:09:25,335
So the take home message here 
is that the ionizing radiation

154
00:09:25,335 --> 00:09:30,696
is for photons whose energy 
is above 13.6 eV.

155
00:09:32,657 --> 00:09:35,726
Here are some additional 
useful constants.

156
00:09:35,726 --> 00:09:37,777
We have the mass of the electron,

157
00:09:37,777 --> 00:09:41,786
the charge of the electron
and the rest energy of the electron,

158
00:09:41,786 --> 00:09:44,957
that is from Einstein's 
famous equation <i>MC^2</i>

159
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:50,296
The energy of an electron 
is equal to 511 keV.

160
00:09:50,296 --> 00:09:53,826
These are some constants
that are useful for the problem sets

161
00:09:53,826 --> 00:09:58,397
of this course and for addressing

162
00:09:58,494 --> 00:10:01,965
some quantitative questions, 
we'll reuse some of those values

163
00:10:01,965 --> 00:10:04,944
later on in weeks to come.

164
00:10:05,584 --> 00:10:08,486
So where does ionizing radiation occur?

165
00:10:08,486 --> 00:10:12,048
What is typically considered 
ionizing radiation?

166
00:10:12,048 --> 00:10:14,985
Here we retake 
the electromagnetic spectrum,

167
00:10:14,985 --> 00:10:19,393
the whole range here, 
from microwave to gamma rays,

168
00:10:19,393 --> 00:10:21,026
PET imaging is here.

169
00:10:21,108 --> 00:10:23,649
And this is the 13.6 eV.

170
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,488
Here we have the energy.

171
00:10:25,488 --> 00:10:27,790
This is 10 eV, this is 100 eV,

172
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,388
it's a logarithmic scale.

173
00:10:29,388 --> 00:10:33,180
This is where 13.6 eV is.

174
00:10:34,544 --> 00:10:38,993
The separation, that's the distinction,
everything to the right

175
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:42,912
is considered ionizing,
and everything to the left

176
00:10:42,912 --> 00:10:45,572
is considered non-ionizing.

177
00:10:46,473 --> 00:10:49,324
Now if we look at where the separation is,

178
00:10:49,324 --> 00:10:52,423
we see it is in the ultraviolet range.

179
00:10:52,423 --> 00:10:55,913
The visible light,
what we see here is here.

180
00:10:56,233 --> 00:10:59,024
This is the light 
where we see the rainbows.

181
00:10:59,024 --> 00:11:01,843
So it's actually quite close 
to visible light, slightly above.

182
00:11:02,604 --> 00:11:06,253
This is why we use products
like this one--

183
00:11:06,253 --> 00:11:09,574
this is typical for Switzerland--
sunscreen.

184
00:11:09,574 --> 00:11:13,164
We use sunscreen to lock out

185
00:11:13,164 --> 00:11:17,603
the harmful ultraviolet rays
which have sufficient energy

186
00:11:17,603 --> 00:11:21,014
so that they can start to be
ionizing in our skin.

187
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:23,904
And when they are ionizing,
as we will see next week,

188
00:11:23,904 --> 00:11:28,234
they can produce harmful effects
in the body and ultimately, cancer,

189
00:11:28,234 --> 00:11:32,855
so this is important why we carry 
sunscreen when we go outside

190
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:38,395
to protect ourselves from these effects.

191
00:11:38,592 --> 00:11:44,252
It's not just in sunburn,
but also from a standpoint of health.

192
00:11:46,033 --> 00:11:51,309
So this is the use of sunscreen
locking out the bad ultraviolet.

193
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,262
So in summary, we are going to talk
about ionizing modalities

194
00:11:56,262 --> 00:11:57,883
for the next few weeks.

195
00:11:57,883 --> 00:12:00,302
We have X-rays, scintigraphy--
we're not going to talk

196
00:12:00,302 --> 00:12:03,501
about this too much--
computer tomography in two weeks,

197
00:12:03,501 --> 00:12:08,552
mammography, and geography, 
PET SPECT, and the separation

198
00:12:08,552 --> 00:12:13,813
that is done between when we consider
it's ionizing is that we are using

199
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:15,939
photon energies that are sufficient

200
00:12:15,939 --> 00:12:19,589
that they can dislodge an electron
in the hydrogen atom.

201
00:12:19,786 --> 00:12:21,627
Here's the nucleus, the proton.

202
00:12:21,627 --> 00:12:24,979
Here's the electron in the K-shell,
and the neutral hydrogen atom

203
00:12:24,979 --> 00:12:30,468
becomes positively charged
upon interaction with an X-ray.
