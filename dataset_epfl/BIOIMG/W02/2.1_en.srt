1
00:00:03,882 --> 00:00:06,695
So in this section,
we are going to discuss

2
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:09,842
the principle of ultrasound imaging.

3
00:00:10,344 --> 00:00:12,700
It's a very basic introduction
and it's not complete

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,572
but what I wanted to share with you

5
00:00:14,572 --> 00:00:17,925
is the basic principle
of ultrasound imaging

6
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:22,364
and some elements
that allow us to determine

7
00:00:22,364 --> 00:00:26,579
the estimated behavior of ultrasound

8
00:00:26,579 --> 00:00:28,195
that is resolution

9
00:00:28,195 --> 00:00:31,431
and the need for resolution
and the need for sensitivity.

10
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:37,188
But first I'd like to start out
with showing you some pictures,

11
00:00:37,188 --> 00:00:39,475
and the question is
what do they have in common?

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,108
So here we have the orca,
the killer whale,

13
00:00:46,448 --> 00:00:50,546
the bat, and the ultrasound scanner.

14
00:00:52,632 --> 00:00:55,875
We have boats, a ship here,

15
00:00:55,875 --> 00:01:00,258
and you might recognize this:
this is a radar station.

16
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:03,598
Now we might say, "Well,
they have all in common

17
00:01:03,598 --> 00:01:08,137
echolocation, ultrasound location
or communication

18
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:09,470
as the common thing,

19
00:01:09,470 --> 00:01:11,265
but clearly with radar,

20
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:16,198
the ultrasound is not the principle
of what the radar is using.

21
00:01:16,198 --> 00:01:18,928
The principle that's used here
is echolocation,

22
00:01:18,928 --> 00:01:21,054
that is the position
of an object is determined

23
00:01:21,054 --> 00:01:25,016
based on the time travel
that is taken

24
00:01:25,016 --> 00:01:27,953
between the object
and the emitting source.

25
00:01:28,691 --> 00:01:31,602
So the orca, or the bat,
that's how they orient themselves;

26
00:01:31,602 --> 00:01:35,338
the ultrasound scanner,
as we will see is the same principle;

27
00:01:35,338 --> 00:01:37,549
and for the boats to determine

28
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:39,922
how high above they are
above the ground.

29
00:01:40,662 --> 00:01:42,546
So it is echolocation.

30
00:01:43,482 --> 00:01:45,754
I want to briefly talk
about the transducer.

31
00:01:45,754 --> 00:01:48,180
We will not go into too much details
of its functioning,

32
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,228
but I just want to introduce here
the ultrasound transducer

33
00:01:52,228 --> 00:01:57,475
that is the generation
of ultrasound waves.

34
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:01,780
It's typically it's like
a computer mouse here,

35
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,819
and let's look here
at the few selected elements

36
00:02:04,819 --> 00:02:06,541
at the at the scan head.

37
00:02:07,276 --> 00:02:10,453
Let's hit on a zoom in
on how this looks like.

38
00:02:10,912 --> 00:02:12,593
This is the scan head:

39
00:02:12,593 --> 00:02:15,025
a microscopic view
of the scan head.

40
00:02:15,025 --> 00:02:17,072
We see here the single crystals,

41
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:20,072
and now can you guess
what this is?

42
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:22,905
This is for size comparison object
placed on here.

43
00:02:22,905 --> 00:02:24,977
This is a human hair.

44
00:02:24,977 --> 00:02:29,440
It gives you an idea
how fine the detector is being built

45
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:32,034
and what kind 
of technology goes into it.

46
00:02:33,084 --> 00:02:38,210
So now the question is, how do we use
ultrasound waves in matter?

47
00:02:38,213 --> 00:02:40,051
And here, we have to address

48
00:02:40,051 --> 00:02:43,191
what are the main fates
of ultrasound waves in tissue--

49
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:46,167
matter, here specifically, in tissue.

50
00:02:47,797 --> 00:02:49,846
Clearly, if we emit the sound wave,

51
00:02:49,846 --> 00:02:53,263
it will not arrive at the end
with the same intensity.

52
00:02:53,263 --> 00:02:56,218
This has to do with the fact
that there is attenuation,

53
00:02:56,218 --> 00:02:58,652
so one effect is attenuation.

54
00:02:59,782 --> 00:03:02,179
So the sound wave
goes through the tissue,

55
00:03:02,179 --> 00:03:04,741
but or through the substance,

56
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:09,155
but as it travels,
it progressively loses energy.

57
00:03:09,155 --> 00:03:11,922
So the intensity
becomes a function of space.

58
00:03:13,182 --> 00:03:16,537
And so, we have
the sound wave goes here;

59
00:03:16,537 --> 00:03:18,874
it comes here with the original intensity.

60
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:20,981
Here, we are assuming
just some kind of tissue

61
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:22,346
of a certain thickness,

62
00:03:22,346 --> 00:03:24,105
and then, the sound wave
here is diminished,

63
00:03:24,105 --> 00:03:27,252
as indicated
by the reduced size of the arrow.

64
00:03:27,612 --> 00:03:30,120
The model that we use,
and very often use

65
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,146
is just simply an exponential model.

66
00:03:32,146 --> 00:03:35,104
We have the intensity
as a function of distance here

67
00:03:35,104 --> 00:03:37,532
as it travels through the tissue here.

68
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:39,919
It is a function
of the original intensity here,

69
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:44,193
and then it's an exponential function
with some factors in the exponent.

70
00:03:45,283 --> 00:03:48,468
We have one factor
that's the attenuation coefficient

71
00:03:48,468 --> 00:03:50,033
that's tissue factor,

72
00:03:50,033 --> 00:03:54,748
and this factor is given in decibels
per centimeter per megahertz,

73
00:03:55,498 --> 00:03:59,342
so we have decibels
per centimeter per megahertz.

74
00:03:59,342 --> 00:04:02,146
We have to have an exponent,
the dimensionless term,

75
00:04:02,146 --> 00:04:04,620
so we have the frequency here
that is in megahertz;

76
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:07,787
we have the distance
that's in centimeters,

77
00:04:09,056 --> 00:04:13,893
and this gives us
a dimensionless term.

78
00:04:14,085 --> 00:04:16,085
Now, I'm not a engineer,

79
00:04:16,085 --> 00:04:19,922
so decibels I have to remind myself --
what it is, the definition --

80
00:04:19,922 --> 00:04:24,791
here the decibels is 10 times logarithm
of <i>I(x)</i> over <i>I_0</i>,

81
00:04:24,791 --> 00:04:27,876
and to give us an idea
again to remind ourselves

82
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:30,147
a three-fold decrease,

83
00:04:30,147 --> 00:04:32,634
a 3dB, three decibels
is a two-fold increase

84
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:36,228
in the intensity
or change in intensity,

85
00:04:36,228 --> 00:04:39,823
so 10 to the 0.3 is equal to two.

86
00:04:41,753 --> 00:04:44,751
so in order to come from
the engineering units,

87
00:04:44,751 --> 00:04:48,352
<i>alpha</i> being given in decibels
to physical units,

88
00:04:48,352 --> 00:04:50,870
we have to have
a unit conversion factor here

89
00:04:50,870 --> 00:04:53,715
and this is this factor K
that we've introduced here

90
00:04:53,715 --> 00:04:58,518
which is equal to logarithm
of natural logarithm of 10/10.

91
00:04:58,679 --> 00:05:00,312
So it's roughly 0.3,

92
00:05:01,182 --> 00:05:04,615
So typically,
this attenuation factor alpha

93
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:08,303
is roughly opened five dB
per centimeter per megahertz,

94
00:05:08,303 --> 00:05:11,889
that's a typical value
that we have in tissue,

95
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:16,356
and so let's see what this means
in specific terms.

96
00:05:16,813 --> 00:05:20,420
And basically, it says that it implies

97
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,956
that if we have
a six megahertz ultrasound signal,

98
00:05:22,956 --> 00:05:25,960
it will lose 3 dB
per centimeter of travel.

99
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:29,745
It's just we take <i> α</i> multiplied
by six megahertz;

100
00:05:30,175 --> 00:05:31,893
this gives us three;

101
00:05:32,257 --> 00:05:35,209
and then we have for a distance
one centimeter

102
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,624
so that this means
3 dB loss of signal intensity,

103
00:05:38,624 --> 00:05:42,562
and that corresponds
to a two-fold loss in wave energy.

104
00:05:43,321 --> 00:05:47,550
So six megahertz per centimeter,
we lose a factor of 2 in energy;

105
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:53,438
So this is an important mechanism.

106
00:05:53,438 --> 00:05:56,253
Here are some specific 
attenuation coefficients:

107
00:05:56,253 --> 00:05:58,254
see for example in water,

108
00:05:58,254 --> 00:06:02,976
ultra sound travels in water
basically without attenuation,

109
00:06:02,976 --> 00:06:05,482
hence the orca uses it

110
00:06:06,256 --> 00:06:09,996
to locate objects at a great distance

111
00:06:09,996 --> 00:06:13,217
as the echo bounces back
with very little loss.

112
00:06:13,217 --> 00:06:18,105
Then we have blood tissue;
bone has a strong attenuation,

113
00:06:18,105 --> 00:06:20,849
and finally, the lung;
these are just some examples.

114
00:06:21,479 --> 00:06:24,836
The second example I want
to talk about is refraction.

115
00:06:24,836 --> 00:06:26,489
And what is refraction,

116
00:06:26,489 --> 00:06:29,098
refraction is we have
an oblique surface,

117
00:06:29,098 --> 00:06:34,374
the sound wave arrives
at the surface and is deflected;

118
00:06:34,374 --> 00:06:35,575
that is refraction.

119
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:39,247
We are not going to discuss it
in this course in much detail,

120
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:40,939
but for completeness sake

121
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:44,517
this is a second fate
of ultrasound waves.

122
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:48,849
Then, we have scatter, and in scatter,
we have the object here.

123
00:06:48,849 --> 00:06:51,158
The wave arrives on the object,

124
00:06:51,158 --> 00:06:54,922
and then is dispersed
into all sorts of directions.

125
00:06:54,922 --> 00:06:56,939
Scatter is a source of noise;

126
00:06:56,939 --> 00:06:58,767
we are also not going

127
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:01,306
to quantitatively address
the effect of scatter,

128
00:07:01,306 --> 00:07:05,104
this one is also mentioned here
for completeness sake.

129
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:07,030
Then we have reflection,

130
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,480
and reflection is basically,

131
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:15,582
what you see when you are in a tunnel
or next to a mountain, to a wall,

132
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:17,385
and you holler at it;

133
00:07:17,385 --> 00:07:20,256
you hear the sound coming back,
you get an echo.

134
00:07:20,256 --> 00:07:22,973
It's what we use here
in Switzerland in the mountains

135
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:24,469
when we hear thunder.

136
00:07:24,469 --> 00:07:30,297
We want to determine if the lightning,

137
00:07:30,297 --> 00:07:32,482
the thunderstorm is close

138
00:07:32,482 --> 00:07:34,791
that we have to take shelter,

139
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,559
and typically, we count to three;

140
00:07:37,559 --> 00:07:39,959
for every three seconds of delay

141
00:07:39,969 --> 00:07:45,341
between the sound of the thunder

142
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:49,660
and the lightning 
that gives us the distance

143
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,921
so that's the generation travel of sound.

144
00:07:55,846 --> 00:07:58,553
Now here's a bit different
when we're looking at reflection,

145
00:07:58,553 --> 00:08:02,828
so we're looking at emitting a sound wave,
it bounces off at an object,

146
00:08:02,828 --> 00:08:05,075
it comes back to us from the time

147
00:08:05,075 --> 00:08:07,883
that we emit the sound wave,
that we hollered at the wall

148
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:10,179
to the time that we hear ourselves,
hear the echo,

149
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:13,658
we can calculate from that
the distance of the object.

150
00:08:13,658 --> 00:08:16,226
So that's the reflection
of sound waves.

151
00:08:16,993 --> 00:08:20,664
And now this is a reflection,

152
00:08:20,664 --> 00:08:25,102
is actually a key element
to imaging with ultrasound,

153
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:26,787
it is <i>the</i> element

154
00:08:26,787 --> 00:08:29,819
that we exploit to generate,

155
00:08:31,351 --> 00:08:34,071
to image tissue with ultrasound.

156
00:08:35,463 --> 00:08:38,916
So what is the basic principle
of ultrasound imaging?

157
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:42,811
I already alluded to it,
it has a lot to do with echo formation,

158
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:47,617
and so we will take here the basics
in principle in very simple terms.

159
00:08:48,807 --> 00:08:51,258
First, you have to emit the sound wave.

160
00:08:51,258 --> 00:08:56,052
Typically, the sound wave or the pulse
is emitted in a short time.

161
00:08:56,844 --> 00:08:59,580
It's typically 1 to 5 microseconds.

162
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,611
Ideally, and as we will see later,

163
00:09:03,611 --> 00:09:06,684
we would like to have
an infinitely shorter sound pulse,

164
00:09:06,684 --> 00:09:10,338
but here we have the requirement
that the sound pulse has a duration

165
00:09:10,338 --> 00:09:12,899
that is a multiple of cycle time.

166
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,273
Now, why is that so?

167
00:09:14,273 --> 00:09:18,965
Well, we want to have
a defined ultra sound frequencies

168
00:09:18,965 --> 00:09:23,958
so we have to give the ultrasound wave
as it is being emitted, the pulse,

169
00:09:23,958 --> 00:09:26,241
we have to go through several cycles

170
00:09:26,241 --> 00:09:28,449
so that in the packet 
there is essentially,

171
00:09:28,449 --> 00:09:31,099
just that frequency we've presented

172
00:09:31,099 --> 00:09:33,447
as you might remember
from the Fourier transformation,

173
00:09:33,447 --> 00:09:37,439
if we take a signal
that's infinitely short, the Dirac Delta,

174
00:09:37,439 --> 00:09:41,139
then the spectrum that is representing,
the frequencies that are in there

175
00:09:41,139 --> 00:09:44,063
are all over and they are white spectrum,

176
00:09:44,063 --> 00:09:48,273
so we don't have a defined frequency
and that is not what is desired.

177
00:09:48,933 --> 00:09:55,080
So we do have a limit on the pulse length
that has to do with the cycle time

178
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:59,226
that is with the inverse
of the ultra sound frequency.

179
00:09:59,776 --> 00:10:02,755
Now here, and typically,
for ultrasound imaging,

180
00:10:02,755 --> 00:10:05,157
the frequencies are
in the megahertz range,

181
00:10:05,157 --> 00:10:07,467
typically, 1.20 megahertz

182
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:12,201
so it's not 20 kilohertz
which is what for example bats use,

183
00:10:12,201 --> 00:10:15,283
what we typically refer to
in an everyday use as ultrasound.

184
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:18,454
The frequencies that are used
for ultrasound imaging

185
00:10:18,454 --> 00:10:21,120
are much higher than that,

186
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,561
so they are in the range of megahertz.

187
00:10:24,911 --> 00:10:31,638
Then the second, once the sample 
is submitted, the echo comes back

188
00:10:31,638 --> 00:10:36,496
and in the detector, in the scan head,

189
00:10:36,496 --> 00:10:39,377
we measure the time
between the emission of the pulse

190
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:42,419
and the return, the time of travel,

191
00:10:42,419 --> 00:10:46,030
as well as the intensity
of the echo that is registered.

192
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:50,903
and finally, the distance
is then calculated

193
00:10:50,903 --> 00:10:52,873
of the echo generating object

194
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,228
using the known wave propagation
velocity <i>C</i> and from the time.

195
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,843
so this could calculate a distance.

196
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:05,603
I'll give you an example here:
we have an object,

197
00:11:06,493 --> 00:11:11,755
this object has a boundary here
that generates an echo,

198
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:13,821
here, this is the boundary;

199
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:16,233
we'll now attached
to it the transducer,

200
00:11:16,643 --> 00:11:19,156
and we will now emit
a sound wave

201
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:21,795
so the sound wave
it is indicated here

202
00:11:21,795 --> 00:11:24,212
by this square object.

203
00:11:24,212 --> 00:11:25,772
We'll just indicate with that

204
00:11:25,772 --> 00:11:28,939
the sound wave of the pulse
as it travels through the tissue

205
00:11:29,479 --> 00:11:30,744
so it travels to that issue,

206
00:11:30,744 --> 00:11:32,928
and we'll assume here
it's perfectly bouncing back

207
00:11:32,928 --> 00:11:34,568
that is we only consider

208
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:37,990
that part of the sound wave
that is being reflected.

209
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,468
So now, we will get

210
00:11:40,468 --> 00:11:44,164
from the known
wave propagation velocity,

211
00:11:44,164 --> 00:11:48,342
we are getting a calculation
of the distance of the tissue boundary.

212
00:11:49,092 --> 00:11:52,386
It's this object here,
this distance we can calculate:

213
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:56,111
we have the time between the emission
of the pulse and detection of the pulse,

214
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,001
we have the sound propagation velocity,

215
00:11:59,001 --> 00:12:01,926
and that allows us
to calculate this distance.

216
00:12:03,154 --> 00:12:06,061
This distance is given
by the speed of sound

217
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:09,971
times the time that we have measured
with the probe head,

218
00:12:09,971 --> 00:12:11,616
divided by two.

219
00:12:11,616 --> 00:12:13,922
Why would it be divided by two?

220
00:12:13,922 --> 00:12:15,695
Well, we have to take into account

221
00:12:15,695 --> 00:12:20,316
that the sound wave once traveled
from the scan head to that issue boundary

222
00:12:20,886 --> 00:12:22,663
that is from here to here,

223
00:12:22,663 --> 00:12:24,841
and then back, so travels
twice the distance.

224
00:12:25,875 --> 00:12:31,104
What is the sound propagation velocity
in tissues or in general?

225
00:12:31,104 --> 00:12:33,206
It's we have their value equations

226
00:12:33,206 --> 00:12:37,011
so the sound propagation velocity is 
equals to that wave times the frequency

227
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:42,612
In air, it is 330 meters per second,
and I've already given you the example,

228
00:12:43,632 --> 00:12:46,500
this is what we use in the mountains

229
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:51,373
to determine how far the lightning
is from us and whether we need shelter,

230
00:12:51,373 --> 00:12:54,233
so this corresponds to, as an idea,
what we have in air ,

231
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:57,386
is 0,33 millimeters per microsecond.

232
00:12:57,946 --> 00:13:01,131
Now in tissue we have
the sound propagation velocity

233
00:13:01,131 --> 00:13:02,929
which is about five times longer.

234
00:13:02,929 --> 00:13:08,566
Here are the values,
so it's five times faster I mean,

235
00:13:08,566 --> 00:13:14,167
so this means that a sound wave
travels about one centimeter

236
00:13:14,167 --> 00:13:16,006
in seven microseconds.

237
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,572
In general the cells propagation,

238
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:22,303
velocity increases
with the density of the tissue

239
00:13:22,303 --> 00:13:26,518
and in bone it's about
three times as fast

240
00:13:26,518 --> 00:13:29,518
so it's four millimeters per micro second

241
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:33,360
so I will mean it would take
about two microseconds

242
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,750
to travel one centimeter in bone.

243
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,860
We have talked about the principle
of determining a distance

244
00:13:41,398 --> 00:13:44,694
between a tissue boundary
and the transducer,

245
00:13:44,694 --> 00:13:46,179
so now let's assume,

246
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:48,448
we have two tissue boundaries
close to each other

247
00:13:48,448 --> 00:13:49,702
and here, the question is

248
00:13:49,702 --> 00:13:51,730
can we distinguish
those two tissue boundaries

249
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:53,112
as being separate?

250
00:13:53,112 --> 00:13:58,101
In other words, how is the resolution
in ultrasound imaging determined?

251
00:13:59,561 --> 00:14:03,169
And it's in essence this is much related

252
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:06,531
to the wavelength lambda 
of the ultrasound wave

253
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:08,172
that we are using here

254
00:14:08,172 --> 00:14:10,769
it is to determine the minimal resolution.

255
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:14,641
I'll show here: the scan head is up here,

256
00:14:14,641 --> 00:14:16,241
and this is what they feel

257
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:20,351
they feel that in ultrasound
the typical pyramidal view

258
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:22,571
that the sound waves will travel through,

259
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:26,292
and we'll put an object, 
an square object here, at this position.

260
00:14:27,272 --> 00:14:30,062
So, what the transducer sees
is after a certain time

261
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:32,122
corresponding to this distance here.

262
00:14:32,412 --> 00:14:34,912
It sees--
here on the horizontal time --

263
00:14:34,912 --> 00:14:37,942
it sees this echo being generated.

264
00:14:40,093 --> 00:14:43,663
So we have said
that the pulse duration has to be

265
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:47,663
a multiple of the cycle time
of the frequency,

266
00:14:47,663 --> 00:14:52,173
so it is equal to <i>n</i>
divided by the frequency.

267
00:14:52,722 --> 00:14:56,075
This is the requirement that we have
a well-defined frequency in the pulse,

268
00:14:56,075 --> 00:15:00,414
so the pulse duration
cannot be infinitely short.

269
00:15:00,414 --> 00:15:02,666
It doesn't matter here
for the sake of the argument

270
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,231
how big this <i>n</i> is.

271
00:15:04,231 --> 00:15:06,709
We can say it's any natural number
that is sufficiently long

272
00:15:06,709 --> 00:15:08,216
that we can say, "Yes,

273
00:15:08,216 --> 00:15:10,893
we have a single frequency
in this pulse

274
00:15:10,893 --> 00:15:12,775
that is being represented.

275
00:15:14,475 --> 00:15:16,275
So to have a defined frequency,

276
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:18,428
we have this relationship
that the pulse length

277
00:15:18,428 --> 00:15:24,185
is a multiple of the period
of the ultrasound wave,

278
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:27,780
and from the wave equation
we are getting

279
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:29,958
that the pulse length
has to be proportional

280
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:34,476
to the wavelength
of the ultrasound wave.

281
00:15:37,326 --> 00:15:39,469
I'll introduce here a second object;

282
00:15:39,469 --> 00:15:42,852
this is here, which is adjacent
to the first object;

283
00:15:44,422 --> 00:15:47,831
we will assume that this is such
that we will see this packet,

284
00:15:47,831 --> 00:15:49,785
the echo-generated
from the second echo

285
00:15:49,785 --> 00:15:51,211
is at this point.

286
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:54,925
I guess we are not arguing here
that for a computer,

287
00:15:54,925 --> 00:15:58,951
these two echoes, that you see here,
that are suggested sequentially here,

288
00:15:58,951 --> 00:16:01,904
that these two echoes
are easily distinguishable

289
00:16:01,904 --> 00:16:04,389
by computerized means.

290
00:16:04,389 --> 00:16:07,001
We can see them that they are
two distinct echoes,

291
00:16:07,001 --> 00:16:08,427
we can define them,

292
00:16:08,427 --> 00:16:10,370
so this means
that we can calculate

293
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:13,432
two separate distances
from these two echoes.

294
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:16,065
So we have a gap
between the echoes,

295
00:16:16,065 --> 00:16:18,160
this generates separate codes,

296
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,750
and this allows us 
to distinguish the two objects.

297
00:16:24,430 --> 00:16:26,013
So this also means

298
00:16:26,013 --> 00:16:30,483
because the pulse duration
is defined by the wavelength

299
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:35,770
and the echo separation 
here, the <i>ΔT</i>

300
00:16:36,970 --> 00:16:41,270
has to be some function
of the duration of the pulse.

301
00:16:41,982 --> 00:16:45,433
And here, I'll give you
a very qualitative idea--

302
00:16:46,113 --> 00:16:49,066
this is not a strict rule here
but will say, "OK,

303
00:16:49,066 --> 00:16:51,020
to have a minimal echo separation

304
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:53,005
for the computer
to be able to say, "Yes,

305
00:16:53,005 --> 00:16:55,011
I've got two separate echoes"--

306
00:16:55,011 --> 00:16:56,660
will say that requirement here

307
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,063
is that the minimal echo separation
that we can have

308
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:03,969
is twice the duration of the echo

309
00:17:03,969 --> 00:17:07,560
of the ultrasound pulse
that's being sent.

310
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:12,638
So this is the resolution,

311
00:17:12,638 --> 00:17:14,911
and is defined by the separation
of the returned calls,

312
00:17:14,911 --> 00:17:17,846
and we have introduced here
the arbitrary criterion

313
00:17:17,846 --> 00:17:22,122
that the returned echoes
should be separated

314
00:17:22,122 --> 00:17:23,900
by twice the pulse length.

315
00:17:24,870 --> 00:17:27,460
So now let's look
at the same situation:

316
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,880
I have again the object here
at some place,

317
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,590
here is the echo 
that it generates, again in time.

318
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,757
So the horizontal time
you see again here:

319
00:17:37,757 --> 00:17:41,224
we have the echo from
the first object that is here,

320
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:45,328
and now the second object
will produce an echo

321
00:17:45,328 --> 00:17:48,989
that's closed to the first object
because it is closer in space,

322
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:51,564
so they are not as well separated.

323
00:17:51,564 --> 00:17:53,148
Now look at what is happening

324
00:17:53,148 --> 00:17:56,027
if we pretend
that the second object

325
00:17:56,027 --> 00:17:58,199
is increasingly closer to the first one.

326
00:17:59,399 --> 00:18:04,493
We will do this by animation, 
and we'll see the echo is moving closer.

327
00:18:04,493 --> 00:18:07,257
Now we have two objects
that are very close to each other

328
00:18:07,257 --> 00:18:09,941
and in the bottom here
can we actually say

329
00:18:09,941 --> 00:18:11,931
that these are
two different echoes?

330
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:15,736
Can the computer distinguish these ones
as two separate echoes?

331
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:18,677
And at some point,
the computer will not be able to say,

332
00:18:18,677 --> 00:18:20,940
"Well I've got two echoes,

333
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:23,838
or I get a single echo
which is dispersed in time.

334
00:18:23,838 --> 00:18:26,625
It cannot actually attribute
to the measurement

335
00:18:26,625 --> 00:18:29,335
a very well defined echo time,

336
00:18:29,335 --> 00:18:32,673
and therefore, at this point,
we won't be able to say,

337
00:18:32,673 --> 00:18:37,857
we've got two objects
separated as here.

338
00:18:38,366 --> 00:18:42,697
So there is no gap between the echoes,
we have no gap between the objects,

339
00:18:42,697 --> 00:18:44,184
we have no separate echoes;

340
00:18:44,184 --> 00:18:45,739
and when you have
no separate echoes,

341
00:18:45,739 --> 00:18:49,997
we cannot distinguish
between the two objects.

342
00:18:51,607 --> 00:18:56,101
So we'll look at the time
for the first object here:

343
00:18:56,101 --> 00:18:58,635
<i>T1</i> is equal to two times the distance

344
00:18:58,635 --> 00:19:01,537
divided by this distance <i>x</i>,

345
00:19:01,537 --> 00:19:03,550
divided by the speed of sound;

346
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:05,931
and for the second object it's <i>T2</i>;

347
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:09,895
is twice the distance divided
by the speed of sound,

348
00:19:09,895 --> 00:19:13,087
and this gives us now
the difference in echo time.

349
00:19:13,257 --> 00:19:15,608
This is <i>T1-T2</i>,

350
00:19:15,608 --> 00:19:20,071
and that gives us two times
the distance between the objects <i>Δx</i>

351
00:19:20,071 --> 00:19:21,631
so <i>Δx</i> being the distance

352
00:19:21,631 --> 00:19:23,779
between this object and this object

353
00:19:23,779 --> 00:19:25,907
divided by speed of sound.

354
00:19:27,807 --> 00:19:33,828
And now, we can conclude,
since the distance here,

355
00:19:33,828 --> 00:19:35,608
the time here is linked

356
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:42,038
to the wavelength
that is the inverse frequency--

357
00:19:44,019 --> 00:19:46,601
this is the time, the separation

358
00:19:46,601 --> 00:19:49,964
of two objects minimal separation
<i>Δx</i> given by that.

359
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:51,577
So in conclusion,

360
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:54,668
because the separation of objects

361
00:19:54,668 --> 00:19:59,067
is linked to the separation
of the echoes in time,

362
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:03,256
which is linked to the cycle time

363
00:20:03,256 --> 00:20:10,060
of the ultra sound frequency being used
which is one over the frequency,

364
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:13,754
we can say that the resolution
increases with frequency,

365
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,818
that is the <i> </i>Δx* diminishes
with frequency,

366
00:20:16,818 --> 00:20:21,696
therefore, the resolution increases
with frequency of the ultrasound.

367
00:20:22,716 --> 00:20:25,427
However, as we have seen earlier
in this segment,

368
00:20:25,427 --> 00:20:29,043
the penetration that is
the attenuation of ultrasound waves

369
00:20:29,703 --> 00:20:31,361
decreases with the frequency--

370
00:20:31,361 --> 00:20:35,507
we've had the exponential law
with the attenuation coefficient alpha.

371
00:20:36,557 --> 00:20:40,313
So, if we want to have good resolution,
we want to increase the frequency,

372
00:20:40,313 --> 00:20:43,679
but if you want to have
good penetration,

373
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,281
we want to decrease the frequency

374
00:20:46,281 --> 00:20:48,344
and so the consequence is

375
00:20:48,344 --> 00:20:51,613
that also here
this is a very practical example

376
00:20:51,613 --> 00:20:55,917
that there is in biomedical imaging
really no free lunch;

377
00:20:55,917 --> 00:20:59,669
we are caught between the need
to increase the resolution

378
00:21:00,629 --> 00:21:02,845
which calls for higher frequency,

379
00:21:02,845 --> 00:21:06,958
and the need to have higher sensitivity
with the tissue depth

380
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,628
which calls for a reduction 
in frequency,

381
00:21:09,628 --> 00:21:13,463
and those two requirements
are opposing each other.

382
00:21:15,028 --> 00:21:19,454
We've pretended it has been 
an acoustic echo recorded,

383
00:21:19,454 --> 00:21:22,516
and the question is
when does an acoustic echo occur?

384
00:21:23,596 --> 00:21:26,320
And here I'll introduce briefly
the background of it,

385
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:31,256
we won't go into the theory
of acoustic impedance too much,

386
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:36,069
and what it means
for the reflection intensity.

387
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:38,992
Acoustic impedance is defined

388
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:42,726
as the density of the tissue
times the sound of the velocity.

389
00:21:42,726 --> 00:21:46,594
It has the units of kilograms
per meter squared per second,

390
00:21:46,594 --> 00:21:50,433
or have introduced a new unit
for that, they call it <i>rayls.</i>

391
00:21:51,761 --> 00:21:55,074
Here are some ideas
of the acoustic impedance,

392
00:21:55,074 --> 00:21:58,485
so this is a measure of the mechanical
properties of the tissue:

393
00:21:59,155 --> 00:22:03,397
we have air here which has
a very low acoustic impedance

394
00:22:03,397 --> 00:22:05,447
and we have skull bone for example

395
00:22:05,447 --> 00:22:07,642
which has a very high 
acoustic impedance,

396
00:22:07,642 --> 00:22:11,600
and you'll notice between fat,
water, kidney, blood, liver, and muscle,

397
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:14,689
the acoustic impedance is
actually fairly similar

398
00:22:14,689 --> 00:22:16,871
--the lung is much lower--

399
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:19,983
but for the all the soft tissues
that we have,

400
00:22:19,983 --> 00:22:22,155
the acoustic impedance are different,

401
00:22:22,155 --> 00:22:25,559
but they are very similar
compared to the other cases.

402
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:29,481
Now, the amount of reflected
wave energy that we have--

403
00:22:29,481 --> 00:22:32,387
this is the intensity I reflected--

404
00:22:32,387 --> 00:22:37,237
is equal to the original intensity,
the incident intensity,

405
00:22:37,237 --> 00:22:40,652
times the reflection coefficient <i>R_i</i>

406
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:44,000
And this reflection happens

407
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,820
when you have
different acoustical properties

408
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,242
that is when you have
a discontinuity in acoustic impedance,

409
00:22:50,242 --> 00:22:53,190
so two different tissues
with different acoustic impedance

410
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:54,636
at their interface

411
00:22:54,636 --> 00:22:56,802
apart of the sound wave

412
00:22:56,802 --> 00:23:00,260
will be bouncing back, will be reflected.

413
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,673
So we have here
as to illustrate the case,

414
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:07,864
we have a tissue one
with an acoustic impedance <i>Z_1</i>,

415
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:11,590
we have here issue 2
with an acoustic impedance <i>Z_2</i>,

416
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,530
and here's the tissue boundary
between the two tissues.

417
00:23:16,282 --> 00:23:18,725
And now we can calculate
from the acoustic impedance,

418
00:23:18,725 --> 00:23:22,628
we can calculate
the reflection coefficient <i>R_i</i>,

419
00:23:22,628 --> 00:23:27,112
and this is essentially given
by the difference in acoustic impedance

420
00:23:27,112 --> 00:23:29,348
divided by the sum
of the acoustic impedance

421
00:23:29,348 --> 00:23:30,938
and the whole thing squared.

422
00:23:31,441 --> 00:23:35,142
This is what this formula here says,

423
00:23:35,142 --> 00:23:41,121
so the acoustic impedance
between for example air and fat

424
00:23:41,121 --> 00:23:46,730
is, because one of the acoustic impedance
is 0, is essentially one.

425
00:23:46,730 --> 00:23:48,275
We have <i>Z_2</i> equal to 0,

426
00:23:48,275 --> 00:23:51,118
so we have <i>Z_1</i> squared
divided by <i>Z_1</i> squared,

427
00:23:51,118 --> 00:23:57,258
and this gives us a full reflection
between the fat issue that is skin,

428
00:23:57,258 --> 00:23:58,768
and the air.

429
00:24:01,185 --> 00:24:03,747
Since the probability
of reflection transmission

430
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:05,204
is assumed to be one,

431
00:24:05,904 --> 00:24:08,401
we can calculate
from the reflection coefficient--

432
00:24:08,401 --> 00:24:11,177
with that relationship--
we can calculate the transmission,

433
00:24:11,177 --> 00:24:14,266
so the transmission is equal
to 1 minus the reflection;

434
00:24:15,046 --> 00:24:17,665
So reflection plus transmission
equals to 1,

435
00:24:17,665 --> 00:24:20,108
and then we can calculate this out

436
00:24:20,108 --> 00:24:22,978
by putting the equation
of the reflection coefficient

437
00:24:22,978 --> 00:24:24,615
into this equation here,

438
00:24:24,615 --> 00:24:27,793
and we get the transmission coefficient.

439
00:24:27,793 --> 00:24:29,886
I'll just show this
for completeness sake,

440
00:24:29,886 --> 00:24:31,879
we're not going to make
much use of this.

441
00:24:33,639 --> 00:24:35,255
So now let's discuss

442
00:24:36,685 --> 00:24:40,446
some reflection coefficients
between some tissues;

443
00:24:40,446 --> 00:24:44,510
to give us an idea what this means,
we now have been very theoretical

444
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:47,677
linking acoustic impedance
to reflection coefficient,

445
00:24:47,677 --> 00:24:50,116
but what does this mean in practice?

446
00:24:50,116 --> 00:24:53,304
So, we'll have here now
on this matrix display:

447
00:24:53,304 --> 00:24:59,039
we have, on one side,
we have the different tissues here,

448
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,683
and we will look if the interfaces
between fat and water

449
00:25:02,683 --> 00:25:04,535
what is the reflection coefficient.

450
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:06,902
Here, the reflection coefficient is 0.47;

451
00:25:06,902 --> 00:25:10,117
is basically means
that 5% of the wave energy

452
00:25:10,117 --> 00:25:11,692
bounces back as an echo

453
00:25:11,692 --> 00:25:14,783
if it hits a interface
between fat and water.

454
00:25:16,524 --> 00:25:20,870
Between muscle and water,
we have 2% that bounces back,

455
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,966
between muscle and fat it's 7%--
surrounding it off here--

456
00:25:25,727 --> 00:25:29,349
then if you look at skin,
we have the skin and water,

457
00:25:29,349 --> 00:25:32,015
skin and fat,
and skin and muscle;

458
00:25:32,015 --> 00:25:34,772
this ranges from 1% to roughly 8%.

459
00:25:35,562 --> 00:25:38,779
Before looking at brain,
liver, and blood,

460
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:41,596
I'll just give you more
instead of going to read through them.

461
00:25:41,596 --> 00:25:43,658
Look at these values:

462
00:25:44,728 --> 00:25:48,316
and you see that they are all
on the order of a few percent,

463
00:25:48,316 --> 00:25:53,993
so this means, if we send
out a sound pulse, the echo,

464
00:25:53,993 --> 00:25:57,426
the energy that comes back
from the echo is a signal

465
00:25:57,426 --> 00:26:02,769
that is on the order of a few percent
of the emitted sound pulse energy,

466
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,554
so it is a relatively weak signal.

467
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:09,485
We'll take the next example
that's cranial bone,

468
00:26:09,485 --> 00:26:10,903
and now the situation is different.

469
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:12,703
Now we're having

470
00:26:12,703 --> 00:26:14,982
quite a substantial reflection
of the sound waves;

471
00:26:14,982 --> 00:26:17,448
is actually on the order of 55%

472
00:26:17,448 --> 00:26:22,282
of the instant energy
that comes back as an echo.

473
00:26:23,651 --> 00:26:30,155
And this is a perfect reason
why we cannot image for example

474
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:33,313
we cannot easily use
ultrasound image our brains.

475
00:26:33,313 --> 00:26:38,121
Here's another material, Plexi glass
that has a high reflection coefficient.

476
00:26:38,741 --> 00:26:42,424
So I want to now discuss
the effect of bone;

477
00:26:43,131 --> 00:26:46,333
like I said,we cannot in adults
use ultrasound very easily

478
00:26:46,333 --> 00:26:48,785
to do scanning of the brain.

479
00:26:48,785 --> 00:26:51,608
in newborns is different because 
we have at the top of the head

480
00:26:51,608 --> 00:26:54,299
the faux opening in newborns,
and so this is a place

481
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,997
where sound waves
can easily pass through

482
00:26:56,997 --> 00:27:00,139
because the bone is
either not present or very thin.

483
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:05,082
So now we have to deal with about 55%

484
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:09,222
of the bone that reflects the tissue

485
00:27:09,222 --> 00:27:12,745
and there is a consequence
and that is a shadow formation

486
00:27:13,745 --> 00:27:16,261
that is in cranial bone,
behind the cranial bone,

487
00:27:16,261 --> 00:27:20,586
we have only 45% of the energy
that passes through the bone,

488
00:27:20,586 --> 00:27:22,432
and I want to discuss that.

489
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:27,528
First, the example: here is a gallstone--
there's an ultrasound here--

490
00:27:27,528 --> 00:27:31,704
here's a gallstone, and you can see
that there is this shadow formation.

491
00:27:31,704 --> 00:27:34,484
This is an artifact
because we have solid material

492
00:27:34,484 --> 00:27:37,094
that is reflecting just like the bone

493
00:27:37,094 --> 00:27:41,171
a large fraction of the sound wave
back to the transducer.

494
00:27:41,171 --> 00:27:46,370
This energy that is reflected of course
is missing behind the gallstone,

495
00:27:46,370 --> 00:27:50,503
so there is less wave energy
that continues beyond that.

496
00:27:50,503 --> 00:27:53,776
I want to illustrate this
with an abstract example here,

497
00:27:54,886 --> 00:27:56,830
so we'll take the case of the bone

498
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:59,584
so we have 45% of the energy
is transmitted;

499
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:04,414
as a reminder, the transmission
is 1 minus the reflection,

500
00:28:04,414 --> 00:28:06,659
so we have
the reflection coefficient here,

501
00:28:06,659 --> 00:28:09,644
we'll say this is
our bone interface here,

502
00:28:10,204 --> 00:28:12,769
Here's the tissue interface
that we'd like to image

503
00:28:12,769 --> 00:28:14,793
but we're passing through bone,

504
00:28:14,793 --> 00:28:17,784
so let's say we come
with 100% wave energy,

505
00:28:18,424 --> 00:28:22,008
then the 55% of reflection implies

506
00:28:22,008 --> 00:28:25,660
that there is a 45%
of the energy that's transmitted,

507
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,839
so only 45% of the wave energy
gets to this interface;

508
00:28:30,829 --> 00:28:32,675
We'll assume
that the reflection is perfect

509
00:28:32,675 --> 00:28:36,312
so then we are just looking
at what is reflected;

510
00:28:36,312 --> 00:28:38,074
the 45% bounce back,

511
00:28:38,074 --> 00:28:43,208
and then they are losing 
again 55% of the energy

512
00:28:43,208 --> 00:28:45,197
when they come to the bone,

513
00:28:45,197 --> 00:28:51,192
so in the end, it's only 45% of 45%
that is received at the scan head,

514
00:28:51,192 --> 00:28:53,141
or in other words, 20%.

515
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:56,790
And this explains in this image here
why we have the shadow here,

516
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:02,799
a big portion of the sound
is being reflected here

517
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:04,973
back to the transducer.

518
00:29:04,973 --> 00:29:06,924
The energy that comes
back here is reduced,

519
00:29:06,924 --> 00:29:10,547
and then when it passes again
through the gallstone it is again reduced

520
00:29:10,547 --> 00:29:12,831
and therefore,
the echo amplitude is reduced,

521
00:29:12,831 --> 00:29:15,608
and that produces
this shadow formation.

522
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,331
Here's another example: can you see
what those stripes are due to?

523
00:29:22,211 --> 00:29:24,053
Do you have an idea?

524
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:29,570
When we have multiple stripes
to dolphin fetus,

525
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,831
it's the bones from the rib cage,

526
00:29:31,831 --> 00:29:34,971
so each one of the ribs
in the dolphin fetus

527
00:29:34,971 --> 00:29:40,975
produces this little shadow image here
as the scan head is placed above it.

528
00:29:41,514 --> 00:29:43,281
Obviously, we cannot control
the movement

529
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:46,475
neither of the dolphin very well
or of the fetus,

530
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,681
and so occasionally,
you see on an image the stripes,

531
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:55,442
and this is from the video I showed
in week one, of the SeaWorld Aquarium,

532
00:29:56,462 --> 00:30:01,027
the ultrasound scan
of the dolphin fetus; just an image.
