1
00:00:03,876 --> 00:00:08,418
Now, I want to briefly talk about
the process of generating x-rays.

2
00:00:08,963 --> 00:00:11,443
It's very schematic
what I will introduce here,

3
00:00:11,617 --> 00:00:17,036
I'm mainly keen on discussing
two major effects that we have,

4
00:00:17,037 --> 00:00:19,222
two major experimental parameters

5
00:00:19,223 --> 00:00:22,423
that are under
the control of the experiment.

6
00:00:23,153 --> 00:00:26,582
And so, we are having here
a negatively charged cathode,

7
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,783
that's the source of the electrons.

8
00:00:29,783 --> 00:00:34,812
We have a filament here
and we use an electrical current

9
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:37,173
that runs through the filament,
here in green,

10
00:00:37,668 --> 00:00:40,068
that is heating up the cathode.

11
00:00:40,452 --> 00:00:43,742
So why is this necessary?
Why do we need a current here?

12
00:00:45,747 --> 00:00:48,976
Well, think about it, we are in the end--
what we want to do

13
00:00:48,977 --> 00:00:52,276
is we want to produce x-rays
and the x-rays, the production,

14
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:54,476
is been done as we'll see shortly

15
00:00:54,477 --> 00:00:57,037
by the release of electrons
from the cathode.

16
00:00:57,181 --> 00:01:02,110
If we heat up the cathode, we increase
the connected energy of the electrons

17
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:06,531
and therefore the probability
that an electron is being released.

18
00:01:08,308 --> 00:01:10,605
Then, what happens
between the cathode and anode,

19
00:01:10,725 --> 00:01:13,575
the electrons are accelerated
by the electric field,

20
00:01:13,738 --> 00:01:18,407
the energy of the electron
its charged times the voltage difference

21
00:01:18,408 --> 00:01:20,117
between cathode and anode,

22
00:01:20,118 --> 00:01:22,348
so that gives us the electron-volts,

23
00:01:22,598 --> 00:01:24,167
here is the charge,

24
00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:27,347
this is a fairly high charge
negative here, positive here,

25
00:01:27,348 --> 00:01:30,577
so the electrons are being emitted
from the cathode

26
00:01:30,578 --> 00:01:34,258
and attracted towards the anode.

27
00:01:35,171 --> 00:01:38,260
So, in the anode we have a target
and this is a metal target

28
00:01:38,261 --> 00:01:40,060
typically it's Tungsten,

29
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:42,531
we'll discuss in a short while why--

30
00:01:44,776 --> 00:01:49,291
So, they heat the anode
and then it's the voltage

31
00:01:49,292 --> 00:01:54,375
between cathode and anode
is up to 150 kiloelectron volts (keV)--

32
00:01:54,751 --> 00:01:56,834
up to 150 kilovolts (kV).

33
00:01:57,686 --> 00:02:01,085
So, this electrons as they interacted
with the target here

34
00:02:01,086 --> 00:02:04,126
the metal target,
they will produce x-rays.

35
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:08,120
And this x-rays are then emitted
and used for imaging.

36
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,279
Now, in this animation
that you see here, let's not be fooled,

37
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,089
the x-rays that are produced
in the anode target

38
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,979
they go in all sorts of directions,

39
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,050
while we have metal shielding
of the x-ray tube here,

40
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:24,178
we are just leaving a window open here,
so it's only through that window

41
00:02:24,298 --> 00:02:27,179
that the x-rays can penetrate

42
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,260
and produce a beam
of x-rays in the direction.

43
00:02:32,661 --> 00:02:36,670
Typically, the intensity of the beam
is expressed as power per area,

44
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:38,501
it is proportional,

45
00:02:39,272 --> 00:02:42,032
the beam is proportional
to the number of x-rays,

46
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:44,202
the number of x-rays is proportional

47
00:02:44,203 --> 00:02:46,612
to the number of electrons
that hit the target,

48
00:02:46,613 --> 00:02:49,628
and the number of electrons
that hit the target, the anode here,

49
00:02:49,748 --> 00:02:54,208
is proportional to the current
in the cathode, so the filament current.

50
00:02:55,926 --> 00:03:00,516
The energy of the x-rays is somehow
related to the voltage difference

51
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:04,139
between anode and cathode,
here and here.

52
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,479
If we have 150 kV, then we produce
electrons with an energy

53
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:13,072
that hit the target of 150 keV.

54
00:03:13,339 --> 00:03:16,878
If we use only 50 kV,
then, the energy of the electrons

55
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,149
as they hit the Tungsten target is 50 keV.

56
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:26,440
So this are the two things
that we can control,

57
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:30,440
we can control the filament current
and so increase the tube current

58
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:34,440
that is increasing
the number of electrons

59
00:03:34,441 --> 00:03:37,991
and therefore the number of photons
per second that are being emitted

60
00:03:38,492 --> 00:03:41,991
and with the voltage between
the cathode and the anode

61
00:03:41,992 --> 00:03:47,001
we control the maximum energy
of the photons that are being emitted,

62
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:51,002
that is we control the energy
of the electrons when they hit target.

63
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,649
Here is just a scheme
showing the same thing again,

64
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,899
we have the filament current,
we have the anode target

65
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,149
the voltage between here
and the whole thing

66
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:04,149
is an tube in the vacuum,

67
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,910
otherwise the electrons
will never see their target.

68
00:04:08,946 --> 00:04:14,516
Now, ideally I said the electrons
have an energy of 150 keV

69
00:04:15,110 --> 00:04:19,500
and ideally this will produce
x-rays of energy for each photon,

70
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:23,660
for each electron
that hits the target of 150 keV.

71
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,979
That would be the ideal case,
but this is not the reality

72
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:31,659
and we are going to have
to look at the emissions of x-rays

73
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:35,659
generated in the x-ray tube,
and we are going to look at

74
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:39,660
the interaction of the electron
with the stationary atom.

75
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:43,452
We'll look at this as a collision
so we have a nucleus here,

76
00:04:44,051 --> 00:04:48,360
we have the electrons as it comes in,
it is attracted by Coulomb force,

77
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:50,201
so it changes direction.

78
00:04:50,868 --> 00:04:54,198
Now, when it changes
direction we have,

79
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,347
we can look at this as a collision,

80
00:04:56,348 --> 00:04:59,618
we have at the beginning,
we have the atom stationary

81
00:05:00,139 --> 00:05:03,499
we have the electron
with a certain linear momentum,

82
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:08,509
it leaves after it has passed
by the nucleus with another momentum,

83
00:05:08,915 --> 00:05:12,135
but now as it has been deflected,
the momentum has changed.

84
00:05:12,776 --> 00:05:16,035
In conservation of linear momentum
as a collision,

85
00:05:16,036 --> 00:05:20,546
requires that there is another object
with a linear momentum

86
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:24,818
that is involved in this collision
and that's the emission of a photon.

87
00:05:26,335 --> 00:05:28,775
So, we have conservation
of linear momentum

88
00:05:29,172 --> 00:05:31,961
and initial linear momentum
of the electron

89
00:05:31,962 --> 00:05:34,397
as equal to the final
momentum of the electron

90
00:05:34,398 --> 00:05:37,258
plus the momentum of the photon.

91
00:05:38,775 --> 00:05:41,604
Now, if you look at Coulomb,
I'm just going to talk here,

92
00:05:41,605 --> 00:05:44,184
Coulomb basically says,
the Coulomb force says

93
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:48,735
that the electron is subjected
to an acceleration

94
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:52,418
which is proportional
to the charge of the electron, <i>Qe</i>,

95
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:56,164
proportional to the atomic numbers, <i>Z</i>,

96
00:05:56,165 --> 00:06:00,415
the number of photons and nucleus,
divided by the mass the electron

97
00:06:00,716 --> 00:06:03,196
and the distance to the nucleus.

98
00:06:04,501 --> 00:06:08,501
So the acceleration of the electron
that is in changing linear momentum

99
00:06:09,501 --> 00:06:12,584
can not, a priori, 
have the need to be defined,

100
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:15,593
we won't be getting 150 keV.

101
00:06:15,594 --> 00:06:20,534
It depends on where the electron
is deflected with a nucleus,

102
00:06:21,004 --> 00:06:26,314
how close this interaction is,
by how much is it deflected, etc...

103
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,630
So, we do not, a priori, know
what this distance are,

104
00:06:31,031 --> 00:06:35,030
so, we will not get a fixed acceleration

105
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:37,999
so we'll not get a fixed photon energy,

106
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,759
we'll get a mixed of photon energy.

107
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:44,119
The way you can imagine this is,
the electron comes to the target

108
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,130
the anode target, it's deflected,
releases a photon

109
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:54,139
then a few micrometers later
or a few atoms later,

110
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:57,374
it interacts with the next nucleus
and it's deflected again

111
00:06:57,375 --> 00:07:00,274
and it releases again a photon,
and so on, and so on.

112
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:02,584
So there is a subsequent
release of the photon

113
00:07:02,585 --> 00:07:04,784
until an electron
essentially comes to rest,

114
00:07:04,785 --> 00:07:10,265
but not a single photon,
in general, has been released.

115
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:12,632
So, we have from this laws,

116
00:07:12,633 --> 00:07:15,953
we have neither the information
of the directionality of radiation,

117
00:07:17,553 --> 00:07:21,553
nor on the photon energy
that it's been released.

118
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:26,396
So, but we do know
a maximum value

119
00:07:26,397 --> 00:07:28,957
for the energy of the photon
that has been released.

120
00:07:29,405 --> 00:07:31,115
How is this defined?

121
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:35,157
Well, the definition here is this,
we have the electron comes in

122
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:39,887
with the connected energy
of 150 keV and let's assume,

123
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:44,305
it is by whatever process
in the anode target,

124
00:07:44,306 --> 00:07:46,605
it's immediately stopped.

125
00:07:46,606 --> 00:07:50,846
Then the energy of the electron
is converted into the energy of the photon

126
00:07:51,106 --> 00:07:54,266
and that equals
to the energy of the electron,

127
00:07:54,794 --> 00:07:57,856
if you have 150 kV at the anode cathode,

128
00:07:57,857 --> 00:08:00,557
the energy of the electron 150 keV

129
00:08:00,777 --> 00:08:02,686
by conservation of energy

130
00:08:02,687 --> 00:08:06,787
the maximum photon energy is 150 keV.

131
00:08:08,433 --> 00:08:13,204
So, this effect of that the electron
is subsequently decelerated,

132
00:08:13,205 --> 00:08:17,995
loses its connected energy,
this is a braking effect on the electron

133
00:08:18,327 --> 00:08:20,973
and the term for this,
that has been used,

134
00:08:20,974 --> 00:08:25,751
is Bremsstrahlung, it's a German term
which basically means braking radiation.

135
00:08:26,113 --> 00:08:27,562
Why it's German?

136
00:08:27,563 --> 00:08:30,333
Well this is historical, until 1945

137
00:08:30,334 --> 00:08:34,835
Germany was
a leading country in physics

138
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:37,775
so, that's why we are with German terms.

139
00:08:38,585 --> 00:08:40,691
So, if you now
look at the relative intensity

140
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:44,144
of this Bremsstrahlung
as a function wavelength,

141
00:08:44,145 --> 00:08:46,503
then we have
decreasing energy to the right,

142
00:08:46,504 --> 00:08:48,593
so the highest energy is on the left,

143
00:08:48,594 --> 00:08:51,053
and as we can see here,
the maximum energy

144
00:08:51,054 --> 00:08:55,343
for a voltage of 50 kV is 50 keV,

145
00:08:55,344 --> 00:08:58,024
this is the maximum energy
that we have here.

146
00:08:58,796 --> 00:09:01,426
As we decrease the voltage,

147
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:04,950
to 40 kV the maximum energy is reduced,

148
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:10,321
we can not go higher
than that maximum energy of 40 keV,

149
00:09:10,747 --> 00:09:14,580
we got 30 kV we are now here,

150
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:17,580
and finally 20 kV.

151
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:24,069
So we have this spectrum
of focal energy for a giving wavelength

152
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,549
that's giving energy,
and this is what is called

153
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:29,060
the Bremsstrahlung continuum.

154
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:34,147
Now, we have the <i>elastic scattering</i>,
I don't want to talk too much about it,

155
00:09:35,318 --> 00:09:38,187
we have, the probability
is proportional to Z,

156
00:09:38,188 --> 00:09:42,188
the atomic number squared divided
by the energy of the electrons squared,

157
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:46,459
and then we have <i>inelastic scaterring</i>,
there the probability

158
00:09:47,751 --> 00:09:50,252
is proportional Z² inelastic scaterring,

159
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:54,930
meaning that we have the electron
which is releasing a photon.

160
00:09:55,825 --> 00:09:58,754
So what does this mean
if it is proportional to Z²?

161
00:09:58,755 --> 00:10:03,485
It means to generate
as much Hertz-electron as many photons.

162
00:10:06,096 --> 00:10:09,235
Hertz-electron, we want to use
a material with high Z

163
00:10:09,236 --> 00:10:13,235
and this is,
the explanation here is

164
00:10:13,236 --> 00:10:16,805
why Tungsten is a good target,
it has a high atomic number

165
00:10:16,806 --> 00:10:19,636
a high number of photons in the nucleus.

166
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,667
So far, we've talked about
the Bremsstralhung continuum

167
00:10:23,672 --> 00:10:27,672
we've explained why this braking
of the electrons in the tissue

168
00:10:27,913 --> 00:10:32,433
is not deterministic
in defining a precise x-ray energy,

169
00:10:33,022 --> 00:10:35,911
and there is another effect
that I need to discuss here,

170
00:10:35,912 --> 00:10:40,141
that characterize the x-ray spectrum

171
00:10:40,142 --> 00:10:42,951
and this is the question
of what are the characteristics

172
00:10:42,952 --> 00:10:44,792
of these fluorescent x-rays.

173
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,521
The mechanism that we are looking at this,

174
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:51,480
we have the electron
that interacts with the atom

175
00:10:51,481 --> 00:10:54,851
and here the interaction
is reminiscent of playing billiard.

176
00:10:55,144 --> 00:10:58,783
Think of the electrons
that comes in like a billiard ball,

177
00:10:58,784 --> 00:11:01,453
it hits another electron
like another billiard ball,

178
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:05,453
that inner shell electron
is then bumped out of its shell

179
00:11:05,454 --> 00:11:07,264
and leaves the atom.

180
00:11:08,241 --> 00:11:12,520
What does this mean now
that the atom is excited,

181
00:11:12,521 --> 00:11:14,510
it is in a higher energy state,

182
00:11:14,511 --> 00:11:17,192
it's no longer has
in the K-shell its electron,

183
00:11:17,193 --> 00:11:20,422
so it is a higher energy state,
in other words,

184
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:23,192
we have a vacancy
in the K-shell, for example,

185
00:11:23,193 --> 00:11:25,752
so to recap, the electron comes in,

186
00:11:25,753 --> 00:11:28,312
bumps the K-shell electron
out of the K-shell,

187
00:11:28,313 --> 00:11:32,313
creates a vacancy,
so there is a spot to be filled

188
00:11:32,927 --> 00:11:35,236
and here is the process that happens,

189
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:39,237
that this inner shell electron
is vacancy here, at this point,

190
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:42,429
is being replenish
by an outer shell electron,

191
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,718
That's called cascading,
so it can be not just one,

192
00:11:45,719 --> 00:11:49,258
but here is the case of one,
we have created this vacancy

193
00:11:49,259 --> 00:11:52,439
by a collision,
the electron is missing,

194
00:11:52,704 --> 00:11:55,013
the atom has a higher energy state

195
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:57,072
so, it wants to go back
to its ground state,

196
00:11:57,384 --> 00:12:00,224
so an outer shell electron
here from the M-shell

197
00:12:00,824 --> 00:12:04,703
falls down into the K-shell here
and as it does so,

198
00:12:04,704 --> 00:12:09,121
it will release a photon
whose energy is exactly

199
00:12:09,122 --> 00:12:11,572
the difference in binding energy.

200
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:16,054
Here we have 2.5 keV
of binding in the M-shell,

201
00:12:16,224 --> 00:12:19,368
we have 69.7 keV in the K-shell

202
00:12:19,369 --> 00:12:23,529
the difference in energy
is giving off as a single photon

203
00:12:23,729 --> 00:12:25,709
that's the characteristic x-ray

204
00:12:25,826 --> 00:12:28,123
and this will have,
and you can do the math here,

205
00:12:28,243 --> 00:12:34,123
is exactly 67 keV K-shell x-ray.

206
00:12:35,842 --> 00:12:39,092
Now looking here,
this is graphically illustrated here,

207
00:12:40,572 --> 00:12:44,572
we have the electron
that impacts the K-shell electron

208
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:47,851
so, it plays billiard,
the two electrons leave the atom

209
00:12:47,852 --> 00:12:50,999
and then you see
that the outer shell electron

210
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,491
falls into the K-shell
and as it does so,

211
00:12:54,492 --> 00:12:58,661
it releases the characteristic x-ray

212
00:12:58,662 --> 00:13:01,752
with a very defined frequency.

213
00:13:03,693 --> 00:13:06,694
So, as a consequence
if we look at the relative intensity

214
00:13:06,695 --> 00:13:11,375
of the emitted x-rays from a target,
here is the molybdenum target,

215
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:15,771
bombarded with electrons
with energy exposed to 35 kV,

216
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:18,717
we have the Bramsstrahlung continuum

217
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:21,087
that we've discussed
in the preceding slide,

218
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:24,508
and then we have
these characteristics x-rays spikes here,

219
00:13:25,621 --> 00:13:28,827
as pointed out here, the energy
difference between the energy levels

220
00:13:28,828 --> 00:13:32,988
is very precise, so this will produce
a very precise photon

221
00:13:33,102 --> 00:13:37,102
and this are those characteristics
or fluorescent x-rays

222
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,219
that are added
to the spectrum of the x-rays

223
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:43,300
that are being produced.

224
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:47,389
Now, there is one effect
that I'd like to discuss,

225
00:13:47,390 --> 00:13:50,390
I've just mention here,
this is Auger emission.

226
00:13:51,256 --> 00:13:54,195
So if you have an excited atom
here, on the beginning

227
00:13:54,196 --> 00:13:56,745
we have the vacancy,
we have the excited atom.

228
00:13:56,746 --> 00:14:01,266
Now, instead of producing
a cascading electron falling down

229
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:04,707
when the electron falls down
into the inner shell,

230
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:06,528
and producing a photon,

231
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:08,277
instead of producing a photon

232
00:14:08,278 --> 00:14:13,328
this can also result
in an emitted electron.

233
00:14:14,026 --> 00:14:17,385
So, the energy instead
of being transferred here to a photon,

234
00:14:17,386 --> 00:14:20,625
it's here transferred
to an outer shell electron

235
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:23,366
and this produces an Auger electron.

236
00:14:24,584 --> 00:14:29,213
So we have seen here,
this is 67 keV energy difference,

237
00:14:29,214 --> 00:14:32,743
which produces
67 keV characteristic x-ray

238
00:14:32,744 --> 00:14:36,411
and here we're having
an Auger electron from the M-shell

239
00:14:36,412 --> 00:14:39,411
at 64.5 keV.

240
00:14:39,412 --> 00:14:41,709
It's reduced because we have
to take into account

241
00:14:42,345 --> 00:14:45,064
that the binding energy
has to be overcome,

242
00:14:45,065 --> 00:14:49,804
so it will have
connected energy of 64.5 keV.

243
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,645
This is Auger emission
and that electron, of course,

244
00:14:52,830 --> 00:14:57,190
will then, diffuse and interact
with the Tungsten target.

245
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,016
And as if it were an electron

246
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:03,907
coming from the outside at 64.5 keV.

247
00:15:04,694 --> 00:15:06,883
So, here is the process in this animation,

248
00:15:06,884 --> 00:15:10,234
the Auger process illustrated,
we have here initial state,

249
00:15:10,874 --> 00:15:12,994
we have the <i>Incident electron</i>

250
00:15:14,774 --> 00:15:17,374
that produces the vacancy here,
in the K-shell,

251
00:15:19,548 --> 00:15:23,477
as the electron falls into the K-shell

252
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:26,016
and an L-shell electron here is emitted,

253
00:15:26,017 --> 00:15:27,767
as a Auger electron.

254
00:15:29,857 --> 00:15:33,276
Now, this concludes the introduction
of the generation of x-rays,

255
00:15:33,277 --> 00:15:37,276
and in the next week we will discuss
the interaction of x-rays

256
00:15:37,277 --> 00:15:40,606
with tissue, the principal modes
will be discussed,

257
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:43,206
we'll introduce
some important relationships

258
00:15:43,207 --> 00:15:46,396
and as well, include a small primary

259
00:15:46,397 --> 00:15:50,396
on x-rays safety considerations

260
00:15:50,397 --> 00:15:52,757
and protection procedures.
