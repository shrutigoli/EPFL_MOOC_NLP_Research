1
00:00:04,751 --> 00:00:08,460
We have seen previously the principle
of ultrasound imaging,

2
00:00:08,482 --> 00:00:11,717
we have seen that the ultrasound waves
are attenuated,

3
00:00:12,297 --> 00:00:15,053
that the distance between the object

4
00:00:15,042 --> 00:00:20,709
and the transducer
and the change in acoustic impedance

5
00:00:20,722 --> 00:00:22,323
is what is being imaged,

6
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:24,427
so imaging tissue boundaries,

7
00:00:24,427 --> 00:00:28,889
and this imparts some limits
on the resolution,

8
00:00:29,417 --> 00:00:31,876
and we've also discussed that resolution

9
00:00:31,867 --> 00:00:34,236
and the need for more sensitivity

10
00:00:34,236 --> 00:00:37,444
are two opposing requirements

11
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:39,794
on the frequency of the transducer.

12
00:00:40,214 --> 00:00:42,396
So the question is obviously,

13
00:00:42,396 --> 00:00:46,001
we would like to have
a good choice in the ultrasound frequency.

14
00:00:46,001 --> 00:00:47,632
If we want to see deep,

15
00:00:47,632 --> 00:00:49,752
we'll probably have to use
a lower frequency,

16
00:00:49,892 --> 00:00:52,236
if we want to see close to the surface,

17
00:00:52,236 --> 00:00:53,899
probably a higher frequency.

18
00:00:53,899 --> 00:00:55,188
That seems logical,

19
00:00:55,188 --> 00:00:57,522
but we can actually say
something more precise

20
00:00:57,522 --> 00:00:59,122
about the optimal choice

21
00:00:59,122 --> 00:01:01,849
and put this into mathematical terms.

22
00:01:01,849 --> 00:01:04,084
And that's the question
we are going to address here,

23
00:01:04,084 --> 00:01:06,527
as how do we estimate the optimal choice

24
00:01:06,527 --> 00:01:08,578
of ultrasound frequency.

25
00:01:10,378 --> 00:01:13,238
So we have the principle
that, as we increase the frequency,

26
00:01:13,238 --> 00:01:14,645
the resolution increases;

27
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:17,726
but as we increase the frequency--
to the right--

28
00:01:17,709 --> 00:01:22,001
the sensitivity, the intensity
of the sound wave,

29
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:24,250
the Signal to Noise Ratio diminishes.

30
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,141
So, if you look at resolution,

31
00:01:28,191 --> 00:01:30,001
the <i>∆x</i> is between two objects

32
00:01:29,983 --> 00:01:31,898
at which we can discriminate them,

33
00:01:31,918 --> 00:01:35,710
we've seen them that this decreases
with increasing frequency,

34
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:43,351
so the <i>∆x</i> is proportional
to 1 over the frequency.

35
00:01:44,621 --> 00:01:48,272
That means the resolution
is proportional to the frequency.

36
00:01:50,642 --> 00:01:52,690
If you look at Signal to Noise Ratio,

37
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,968
we have seen, from earlier,

38
00:01:54,968 --> 00:01:58,919
that the signal returned
from an echo-generating source,

39
00:01:59,859 --> 00:02:03,334
echo-generating tissue interface
at a certain distance <i>x</i>

40
00:02:03,308 --> 00:02:04,627
from the transducer

41
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:07,709
is given by the original intensity,

42
00:02:07,709 --> 00:02:10,460
the attenuation coefficient
that we have discussed,

43
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:13,751
and we are multiplying this here
by the reflection coefficient

44
00:02:13,734 --> 00:02:17,139
which just basically says, "OK,
the signal that we see at the transducer

45
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:22,459
is given by the reflection coefficient
that's the percentage of ultrasound energy

46
00:02:22,481 --> 00:02:24,248
that's bouncing back as an echo;

47
00:02:24,248 --> 00:02:26,170
and here we have the factor <i>2 x</i>

48
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,722
because we are looking
at twice the distance.

49
00:02:29,342 --> 00:02:31,810
So, if we are at the distance <i>x</i>
from the transducer,

50
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,232
the attenuation happens twice,

51
00:02:34,232 --> 00:02:36,147
on the travel in and on the travel back,

52
00:02:36,147 --> 00:02:39,843
and that's why we have the factor 2
instead of <i>x</i> here,

53
00:02:39,843 --> 00:02:41,316
in the equation.

54
00:02:41,656 --> 00:02:44,791
Now, in terms of--for the sake
of the argument here,

55
00:02:44,791 --> 00:02:47,651
since we are interested in
the choice of frequency,

56
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:51,099
we'll assume
the reflection coefficient is constant

57
00:02:51,649 --> 00:02:54,517
with respect to the ultrasound frequency.

58
00:02:56,287 --> 00:02:57,815
So, in this equation here,

59
00:02:57,834 --> 00:03:00,001
we have: <i>f</i> is the ultrasound frequency--

60
00:02:59,994 --> 00:03:01,993
that is an experimental parameter;

61
00:03:01,993 --> 00:03:05,178
we choose that, by generating
the ultrasound waves.

62
00:03:05,757 --> 00:03:09,292
<i>α</i> is the attenuation coefficient
that's a tissue parameter--

63
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:14,198
that one we cannot change, that's given
by the tissue under investigation.

64
00:03:15,478 --> 00:03:18,687
So now, the challenge here
is to find the optimal frequency.

65
00:03:19,337 --> 00:03:20,659
And what I am proposing here

66
00:03:20,659 --> 00:03:25,151
is to simply look at maximizing
the product of the frequency,

67
00:03:25,151 --> 00:03:26,766
and the signal.

68
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,479
The frequency increases --

69
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,155
is proportional to resolution--

70
00:03:32,155 --> 00:03:33,885
so is a measure of resolution,

71
00:03:33,885 --> 00:03:36,532
and the signal is a measure
of sensitivity,

72
00:03:36,532 --> 00:03:41,123
so, we'll minimize here
the resolution times sensitivity

73
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:44,834
by maximizing <i>f</i> times <i>s</i>,

74
00:03:44,845 --> 00:03:48,087
so maximizing
resolution times sensitivity.

75
00:03:48,547 --> 00:03:51,339
It is exactly this function,
it's the proposed function.

76
00:03:51,339 --> 00:03:55,702
What I want to do here is illustrate
the principle of getting an idea

77
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:59,840
of what is a good ultrasound frequency
for a good application,

78
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:05,146
So, we want to find
the maximum of <i>f</i> times <i>s</i>,

79
00:04:05,556 --> 00:04:11,197
and that is, we want to calculate
the derivative of <i>f</i> times <i>s</i>

80
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:14,824
and set this derivative to zero
to find the maximum.

81
00:04:15,114 --> 00:04:19,404
So that is, in other words,
we'll take <i>f</i> times this function here,

82
00:04:19,404 --> 00:04:23,514
derive this with respect to <i>f</i>,
take the derivative with respect to <i>f</i>--

83
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:26,308
which is here; we've taken out
what is constant--

84
00:04:26,862 --> 00:04:30,174
the reflection coefficient is [inaudible]
to not depend on the frequency.

85
00:04:30,876 --> 00:04:33,335
The original signal intensity
is also constant,

86
00:04:33,327 --> 00:04:36,519
and now we have to find
the derivative of this function

87
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,436
and set this to zero.

88
00:04:38,436 --> 00:04:40,499
So these are the constants moved out,

89
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:43,295
and now, we are going to look
and be interested in calculating

90
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:45,593
the derivative of this
and setting this to zero.

91
00:04:46,103 --> 00:04:49,803
So, we have the chain rule here;

92
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:52,748
that it supplies then the two rules
of derivation.

93
00:04:53,208 --> 00:04:56,937
We separate out, multiply out
the exponent factor

94
00:04:56,918 --> 00:05:00,918
and now we got the thing
in the parenthesis here.

95
00:05:00,941 --> 00:05:02,698
Exponent is never zero,

96
00:05:02,698 --> 00:05:06,207
so we are interested in finding out
when this is zero,

97
00:05:06,827 --> 00:05:09,927
and this happens to be
if the ultrasound frequency

98
00:05:11,267 --> 00:05:15,606
equals to <i>f_0</i>, which equals
to <i>1 / (2 α k x)</i>.

99
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:20,835
Remember, <i>k</i> is the conversion factor
between decimals and physical units.

100
00:05:21,596 --> 00:05:23,206
So, what does this mean?

101
00:05:23,206 --> 00:05:24,850
Well, what it basically means

102
00:05:24,850 --> 00:05:28,902
is with increasing absorption--
that is with increasing <i>α</i>--

103
00:05:28,902 --> 00:05:33,852
the optimal frequency decreases,
it's <i>1 / α</i>;

104
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:36,270
it also decreases with distance.

105
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:38,348
So, if a distance <i>x</i> is long,

106
00:05:38,334 --> 00:05:40,085
that the sound wave has to travel;

107
00:05:40,103 --> 00:05:43,598
<i>x</i> increases, then the frequency
has to decrease too

108
00:05:43,598 --> 00:05:46,998
if we want to stay
at the optimal frequency.

109
00:05:48,004 --> 00:05:50,605
So, how optimal is this choice of <i>f_0</i>?

110
00:05:50,605 --> 00:05:53,787
We can, of course, say, "Well,
we want to measure at different depths.

111
00:05:53,787 --> 00:05:55,360
We are not just limited to one depth."

112
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,124
Here we're saying, mathematically,
that's just one optimum.

113
00:05:59,214 --> 00:06:01,306
We might have
also different intonation coefficients

114
00:06:01,306 --> 00:06:02,861
for different tissues,

115
00:06:03,941 --> 00:06:09,295
so this gives us a spread
of optimal choices of frequency,

116
00:06:09,295 --> 00:06:11,966
and the question is
how critical is this choice.

117
00:06:12,456 --> 00:06:17,140
Are we really bound to an exact formula,
exact equation, like this one here,

118
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:20,403
or can we be a bit more subtle about it?

119
00:06:21,053 --> 00:06:22,332
So, what we are doing now here

120
00:06:22,332 --> 00:06:24,582
is we are plotting exactly
this function here,

121
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:27,264
normalized to <i>1</i> at the maximum, here,

122
00:06:27,264 --> 00:06:29,165
and we are plotting on the <i>x</i> axis,

123
00:06:29,165 --> 00:06:31,111
<i>f</i> times <i>α 2 k</i>.

124
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:37,641
<i>x</i> --this is just making--
this is the argument of the exponent here;

125
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,215
this is dimensionless,

126
00:06:39,215 --> 00:06:44,619
and the optimum here is
at when <i>f_0 = 1 / α 2 k x</i>,

127
00:06:44,619 --> 00:06:47,345
so that is written this term here,
and equals to <i>1</i>.

128
00:06:47,345 --> 00:06:48,972
So that is the optimal here.

129
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:53,004
And now, we can say, "Well, you know,
we are willing to compromise,

130
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:56,249
to be within, let's say,
20% of the optimum,

131
00:06:56,249 --> 00:07:00,941
and the question is how much of a range,
of variability in frequencies

132
00:07:00,941 --> 00:07:02,411
do we have?

133
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:08,287
And so, if we actually allow this
to be within 20% of the optimum,

134
00:07:08,287 --> 00:07:13,465
then we can see that we have a range
from <i>f_0</i> of <i>0.5</i> to almost <i>2</i>.

135
00:07:13,465 --> 00:07:17,045
And that is a nearly 4-fold range
in the frequency,

136
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,582
or, in other words, for a given frequency,

137
00:07:19,582 --> 00:07:23,295
we have a 4-fold range in <i>1 / x</i>
that we can choose,

138
00:07:23,295 --> 00:07:26,342
or a bigger range
in attenuation coefficients.

139
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:28,398
So, in other words, this means

140
00:07:28,398 --> 00:07:32,658
we are not crucially linked
to a precise choice

141
00:07:32,658 --> 00:07:36,131
of the ultrasound frequency
to stay close to the optimum,

142
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:39,246
but we have to have some idea where we are

143
00:07:39,246 --> 00:07:42,372
with respect to the wanted application.

144
00:07:43,442 --> 00:07:47,122
I'll give you some examples here
to illustrate the case.

145
00:07:47,122 --> 00:07:50,232
So if you take a high resolution image,

146
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:53,716
at high ultrasound frequency,

147
00:07:54,116 --> 00:07:58,755
this is an ultrasound scan
at very high resolution

148
00:07:59,175 --> 00:08:01,389
of the skin and subcutaneous tissue.

149
00:08:02,549 --> 00:08:07,658
So we have here the epidermis,
at the surface,

150
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:12,736
we have here the loose connective tissue
and subcutaneous fat--

151
00:08:12,736 --> 00:08:14,425
that's this layer here;

152
00:08:16,335 --> 00:08:19,485
we have the muscle interface,
so that's between fat and muscle;

153
00:08:19,485 --> 00:08:21,682
and you can see the interface
is not just one line,

154
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:26,129
it's actually, there is some dimensions
to it that shows the high resolution.

155
00:08:26,129 --> 00:08:28,969
And here, we have
the muscle fibers interface.

156
00:08:28,969 --> 00:08:31,143
We can actually see
illustrated its function

157
00:08:31,143 --> 00:08:34,195
so we can nearly see
the individual muscle fibers,

158
00:08:34,195 --> 00:08:36,078
so it's a very high resolution.

159
00:08:36,238 --> 00:08:38,931
And, finally, we have, down here,

160
00:08:38,931 --> 00:08:41,916
we have the interface to the bone.

161
00:08:43,496 --> 00:08:46,079
So, to be able to see
with an ultrasound image

162
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:49,418
to see almost nearly
the individual muscle fibers here,

163
00:08:49,418 --> 00:08:50,961
you see the structure,

164
00:08:50,961 --> 00:08:54,926
this means that the ultrasound frequency
was very high resolution

165
00:08:55,626 --> 00:08:58,522
to obtain such
a nice high resolution image

166
00:08:58,522 --> 00:09:01,237
of the surface tissue.

167
00:09:02,197 --> 00:09:04,115
Another example is liver.

168
00:09:04,665 --> 00:09:06,756
In the liver, deep in the liver here,

169
00:09:06,756 --> 00:09:08,907
we take low-resolution ultrasound,

170
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:10,439
we cannot use the same resolution,

171
00:09:10,439 --> 00:09:12,897
because we would simply not get
with the wave energy

172
00:09:12,897 --> 00:09:14,238
all the way down here.

173
00:09:14,238 --> 00:09:17,507
This is a liver here, and you can see
all these spots here,

174
00:09:17,507 --> 00:09:19,525
these are metastases
that have been formed

175
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,971
but we can nicely image them,
even at the base here,

176
00:09:21,971 --> 00:09:25,612
but we will never be at anywhere close
to the resolution

177
00:09:25,612 --> 00:09:31,232
that has been done here on the left
for the subcutaneous tissue.

178
00:09:31,232 --> 00:09:33,692
So this requires high ultrasound frequency

179
00:09:33,692 --> 00:09:37,260
and here, we are required
with low ultrasound frequency

180
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,550
to obtain the depth penetration.

181
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,213
Now, I want to finish with some examples,

182
00:09:44,213 --> 00:09:47,565
so let's take the 3D ultrasound.

183
00:09:48,085 --> 00:09:50,736
The principle--I would not go
through the mathematics here;

184
00:09:50,736 --> 00:09:54,494
the movement, the image and construction

185
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:57,439
is that the transducer is being moved
during the exposure;

186
00:09:57,439 --> 00:10:00,298
it's either a linear shift,
swinging, or rotation.

187
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:03,545
The received echoes
are stored in the memory

188
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:05,917
and based on the movement
that the transducer has done.

189
00:10:06,378 --> 00:10:11,528
The image is then in the plane
mathematically reconstructed.

190
00:10:11,888 --> 00:10:16,922
So this is the base image of a fetus here.

191
00:10:16,922 --> 00:10:21,259
This section here is then chosen
to reconstruct the 3D image,

192
00:10:21,259 --> 00:10:26,316
and this is the 3D image here;

193
00:10:26,316 --> 00:10:30,833
and you can see here,
on the umbilical cord,

194
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:34,849
in the 2D image and the 3D image
we can see the umbilical chord,

195
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:36,820
we see the hand;

196
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:39,294
and as you see
in the sequence of the video,

197
00:10:39,294 --> 00:10:41,890
this can be done in real time,

198
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:47,713
so one sees the baby move in the belly;

199
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:51,186
this is actually one from the 31.

200
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:54,750
We call it fetus and 3D ultrasound;

201
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,895
if you search this on YouTube,

202
00:10:56,895 --> 00:11:01,040
you'll actually find around 28,000 hits
of people who have uploaded

203
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:05,416
their 3D ultrasounds of their babies
at 31 weeks of gestation;

204
00:11:05,416 --> 00:11:07,172
so it's a very popular means

205
00:11:07,172 --> 00:11:10,228
and showing how the babies smile,
how they move,

206
00:11:11,158 --> 00:11:13,228
how they suck their thumbs etc.,

207
00:11:13,228 --> 00:11:14,817
already at that age.

208
00:11:16,534 --> 00:11:17,975
We'll take the video here,

209
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:19,652
and if you look at the sequence,

210
00:11:19,652 --> 00:11:22,061
we'll first see the basis on the image,

211
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:24,503
and then the reconstruction.

212
00:11:24,503 --> 00:11:26,261
As this is done in real time,

213
00:11:26,261 --> 00:11:28,975
the baby moves in the womb.

214
00:11:28,975 --> 00:11:31,393
This is observable, the baby smiles--

215
00:11:31,393 --> 00:11:32,887
this can imaged.

216
00:11:33,037 --> 00:11:37,012
We also see here the doctor ultrasound,

217
00:11:37,012 --> 00:11:40,717
the beating is the characteristic sound
of newborn babies in the womb

218
00:11:40,717 --> 00:11:43,479
and then, again, the 3D image.

219
00:11:49,988 --> 00:11:53,140
Another way to ultrasound an image

220
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,673
is the use of contrast agents.

221
00:11:54,673 --> 00:11:57,998
Now, the term <i>contrast agents</i> means

222
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:01,696
the substance that alters the contrast
of the imaging modality.

223
00:12:01,696 --> 00:12:04,844
In ultrasound, this is gas-filled bubbles.

224
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:08,604
Here's a microscopic view
of the gas-filled bubbles.

225
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:10,168
Why gas filled?

226
00:12:10,384 --> 00:12:12,428
Well, we have seen that air in tissue

227
00:12:12,428 --> 00:12:14,357
there is a very high change,

228
00:12:14,357 --> 00:12:16,664
a very big change in acoustic impedance,

229
00:12:16,664 --> 00:12:19,089
so there is a big reflection of echos,

230
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:22,235
but then there is also
a higher harmonic imaging

231
00:12:22,235 --> 00:12:25,142
that is introduced here,

232
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:27,982
and resonance effects 
on these micro bubbles

233
00:12:28,612 --> 00:12:33,949
that makes them a very good tool
to generate very strong echoes.

234
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:39,518
So for the purpose of this course
we'll stick with the idea

235
00:12:39,518 --> 00:12:43,890
that they have tiny <i>Z</i> inside,
the air bubbles,

236
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:47,267
so there is a total reflection
of the ultrasound.

237
00:12:47,857 --> 00:12:50,862
And here, we have an example
of kidney perfusion.

238
00:12:51,602 --> 00:12:55,086
If we look at the perfusion of the kidney,

239
00:12:55,616 --> 00:12:58,380
we can see that these micro-bubbles
arrive in the kidney,

240
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,716
the change in signal is color-coded,

241
00:13:00,716 --> 00:13:03,243
and once it's very nice here in the mouse,

242
00:13:03,243 --> 00:13:05,787
the arrival of the micro-bubbles
in the kidney,

243
00:13:05,787 --> 00:13:08,852
then we can measure the kidney perfusion.

244
00:13:10,132 --> 00:13:12,164
And the last example
I want to discuss here

245
00:13:12,164 --> 00:13:15,258
is how can ultrasound detect moving blood?

246
00:13:16,238 --> 00:13:19,781
And here, the effect that is being used
is the Doppler effect.

247
00:13:21,301 --> 00:13:24,846
So, what happens if the tissue is moving,

248
00:13:27,956 --> 00:13:29,471
if there is a moving tissue?

249
00:13:29,471 --> 00:13:33,971
This results in a shift of the frequency,
shift of the ultrasound frequency,

250
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:38,510
and this is the well-known Doppler effect,

251
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:42,928
and this is detected by demodulation
for detection.

252
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:49,080
Now, question: are you familiar
with the Doppler effect?

253
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:52,599
Where have you been exposed to it?

254
00:13:54,339 --> 00:13:56,950
I am pretty sure you've been exposed
to the Doppler effect,

255
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,446
maybe you have not realized it,
but maybe you have.

256
00:14:01,836 --> 00:14:03,385
Well, I'll give you one example.

257
00:14:04,075 --> 00:14:07,392
You hear an ambulance,
or a police car, when it drives to you.

258
00:14:08,062 --> 00:14:11,013
Is the pitch of the sound higher 
than when it drives away from you?

259
00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:17,318
This is exactly the Doppler effect
for sound waves.

260
00:14:17,685 --> 00:14:20,369
Now, what we are doing in ultrasound
is the same principle:

261
00:14:20,369 --> 00:14:22,766
you have a change in sound frequency,

262
00:14:22,766 --> 00:14:26,963
and this is due to the fact
that the source of the sound,

263
00:14:26,963 --> 00:14:30,098
or the interface of the tissue is moving.

264
00:14:32,721 --> 00:14:35,121
The Doppler effect
is a more general principle

265
00:14:35,121 --> 00:14:38,327
and, depending on where you are,

266
00:14:38,327 --> 00:14:42,004
you have most likely being exposed to it,

267
00:14:42,674 --> 00:14:47,340
even today, as you are watching it,
or at work; you have been exposed to it.

268
00:14:49,497 --> 00:14:52,347
Ever walked through
an automatically opening door?

269
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:57,847
Try standing in front of the door
when you are alone,

270
00:14:57,847 --> 00:15:00,530
and just stand there.

271
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,678
Most likely, the door will close.

272
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:06,443
It will not stay open
as you are standing in front of the door.

273
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:07,971
The minute you move your hand,

274
00:15:07,971 --> 00:15:10,493
it will open the door.

275
00:15:10,493 --> 00:15:13,706
Typically, this is done
with infrared sensors,

276
00:15:13,706 --> 00:15:15,837
also using the Doppler shift,

277
00:15:15,837 --> 00:15:19,748
but now the Doppler shift
is in the optical range,

278
00:15:19,748 --> 00:15:21,465
it detects a moving object

279
00:15:21,465 --> 00:15:25,123
by detecting small changes
in the wavelength of light;

280
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:28,552
it's the same phenomenon there
that's being used.

281
00:15:29,915 --> 00:15:32,114
Let's look at the propagation
of sound waves:

282
00:15:32,114 --> 00:15:36,943
I will stick with this very empirical,
very qualitative...

283
00:15:36,943 --> 00:15:39,836
For a stationary object,
the sound waves travel into,

284
00:15:41,366 --> 00:15:44,655
with the same sound speed
in all directions,

285
00:15:44,655 --> 00:15:49,267
so we have here indicated:
the maximum between sound waves,

286
00:15:49,267 --> 00:15:50,863
that's the wavelength here,

287
00:15:50,863 --> 00:15:54,154
and it equals to <i>z</i> times <i>T</i>.

288
00:15:54,794 --> 00:15:58,162
If you have now a source moving
with the velocity <i>v_0</i>

289
00:15:58,162 --> 00:15:59,813
and appear at <i>T</i>,

290
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:02,985
the source will soon move closer

291
00:16:02,985 --> 00:16:05,811
to the detector, by <i>v_0 T</i>.

292
00:16:06,141 --> 00:16:07,987
And then, this is what we are observing:

293
00:16:07,987 --> 00:16:09,833
here's the source moving to the right,

294
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:13,258
but now we have the maximum
between the sound waves

295
00:16:13,258 --> 00:16:17,381
is now given by <i>(c-v_0) T</i>.

296
00:16:18,752 --> 00:16:22,702
And the maximum here is <i>(c+v_0) T</i>.

297
00:16:22,702 --> 00:16:25,752
That's the wavelength 
that's observed here,

298
00:16:25,752 --> 00:16:27,737
and <i>T</i> here is the same time.

299
00:16:27,737 --> 00:16:30,354
So, in the direction of the motion,
in front,

300
00:16:30,354 --> 00:16:34,852
the difference between the sound
maximum, that is the wave length,

301
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:36,273
is shorter,

302
00:16:36,273 --> 00:16:38,953
and in the back of the source,

303
00:16:38,953 --> 00:16:43,159
the difference
between the maximum is longer,

304
00:16:43,159 --> 00:16:45,635
so this is a longer wavelength

305
00:16:45,635 --> 00:16:47,655
and ends in lower frequency,

306
00:16:47,655 --> 00:16:51,743
and that's the characteristic sound
that you hear where the ambulance is.

307
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:54,002
Now, I'll give you here just a formula
from the literature:

308
00:16:54,482 --> 00:16:59,017
we have the difference in frequency,
between the front and the back here

309
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:03,107
is given by two times the frequency
of the sound wave,

310
00:17:03,107 --> 00:17:05,150
the velocity of the object,

311
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:12,432
<i>cos α</i>, where <i>α</i> is the observer frequency
divided by the speed of sound.

312
00:17:12,937 --> 00:17:14,465
So <i>c</i> is the speed of sound,

313
00:17:14,465 --> 00:17:16,333
<i>v_0</i> is the speed of the source,

314
00:17:16,333 --> 00:17:18,967
so, police car, or ambulance;

315
00:17:18,967 --> 00:17:22,151
here, we'll say it's blood-- it's 50 cm/s.

316
00:17:22,151 --> 00:17:25,486
And let's say the frequency
of the moving source is 5 MHz.

317
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:31,758
If you take the speed of sound
from the tissue, 1,500 m/s,

318
00:17:31,758 --> 00:17:37,269
the characteristic assumed value
of blood flow, 50 cm/s,

319
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:39,392
and an ultrasound frequency.

320
00:17:41,011 --> 00:17:43,435
We'll just say that we are at an angle

321
00:17:43,435 --> 00:17:44,685
where we can detect it,

322
00:17:44,685 --> 00:17:51,378
and we'll now estimate 
the Doppler effect that we can have.

323
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:55,942
And if you take this
with these numerical examples,

324
00:17:55,942 --> 00:18:00,821
we can calculate out the values,
we'll take punching the numbers,

325
00:18:00,821 --> 00:18:02,771
and we can calculate.

326
00:18:02,771 --> 00:18:06,107
But this is roughly,
a shifting frequency of 3 kHz.

327
00:18:07,187 --> 00:18:12,628
3 kHz is 0.05%
of the original ultrasound frequency;

328
00:18:12,628 --> 00:18:14,272
that's very low,

329
00:18:14,272 --> 00:18:18,629
but 3 kHz in absolute terms
is easily detectable

330
00:18:18,629 --> 00:18:24,365
with a demodulator to be able to calculate
that there is something moving.

331
00:18:24,786 --> 00:18:26,750
The moving source that we are talking here

332
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:29,430
is of course
the moving interface of this blood.

333
00:18:29,914 --> 00:18:31,385
Then we have moving blood;

334
00:18:31,385 --> 00:18:34,215
that is what we mean here:
the source means here

335
00:18:34,215 --> 00:18:37,356
the echo-generating object, our interface.

336
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:41,451
So, here we are looking at the image.

337
00:18:41,451 --> 00:18:45,453
We see, over time, the blood flow
that's done with the Doppler ultrasound

338
00:18:45,453 --> 00:18:48,266
that's taken from
the 3D ultrasound example

339
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:49,706
of the newborn baby

340
00:18:49,706 --> 00:18:51,838
that I have just shown you earlier.

341
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:56,535
And we have here a video of a stent--

342
00:18:56,535 --> 00:18:59,921
this is from the internal 
carotid artery stent.

343
00:18:59,921 --> 00:19:02,096
The stent is typically a spiraled object,

344
00:19:02,096 --> 00:19:03,625
it's like a spring,

345
00:19:03,625 --> 00:19:06,378
that is there to reinforce
the vessel walls,

346
00:19:06,378 --> 00:19:09,551
and as you can see, in this video here,

347
00:19:09,551 --> 00:19:11,487
you could see very nicely the blood flow,

348
00:19:11,487 --> 00:19:14,560
and you see also from the stent
the changing blood flow

349
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:18,860
at the location of the stent
is [inaudible] of the structure here

350
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:23,489
corresponds very nicely
to the structure of the stent.

351
00:19:26,389 --> 00:19:27,742
So what we have here

352
00:19:27,742 --> 00:19:30,238
is an ultrasound transducer

353
00:19:30,238 --> 00:19:32,239
which detects the Doppler effect;

354
00:19:33,024 --> 00:19:36,175
it is used to detect the moving blood,
as I just explained,

355
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:38,984
and I am going to use it here
on myself as a demonstration.

356
00:19:38,984 --> 00:19:41,730
The sound that you will hear
is actually something for those of you

357
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,870
who have been involved
in ultrasound of newborns,

358
00:19:45,330 --> 00:19:48,574
unborn babies, that you are
very familiar with.

359
00:19:48,574 --> 00:19:50,837
It's the typical sound of ultrasound.

360
00:19:51,865 --> 00:19:53,714
So, I'm going to try to find a sweet spot;

361
00:19:53,714 --> 00:19:55,924
This may take a while until I find it,

362
00:19:55,924 --> 00:19:57,443
but you will see on the screen here

363
00:19:57,443 --> 00:19:59,026
that is on the overhead,

364
00:20:00,016 --> 00:20:01,815
you will see the heartbeat.

365
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:18,820
(sound of ultrasound)

366
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:32,405
OK, so that's a demonstration
of the heartbeat,

367
00:20:32,405 --> 00:20:34,045
that's a typical sound of ultrasound,

368
00:20:34,045 --> 00:20:36,452
and here, it was done with moving blood.

369
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:40,413
That's the demonstration
that concludes the ultrasound section.
