1
00:00:04,499 --> 00:00:08,789
Okay. In this week,
we're going to talk about

2
00:00:08,789 --> 00:00:11,659
some features that are important 
for understanding

3
00:00:11,659 --> 00:00:14,317
the contrast mechanisms 
in magnetic resonance imaging.

4
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:19,458
Now, there is an issue here that is,

5
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:23,256
we have spent not much time
on each of the imaging techniques,

6
00:00:23,256 --> 00:00:24,728
x-ray-based techniques.

7
00:00:25,718 --> 00:00:31,189
And there is something 
that is different with magnetic resonance

8
00:00:31,189 --> 00:00:36,679
and that is that the interactions

9
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:41,570
between what we can manipulate
on the scanner

10
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:45,719
and how the image looks like,
these interactions are far more diverse--

11
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,371
the mechanisms are far more diverse.

12
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:51,231
And so, the point 
I want to make here is that,

13
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:55,705
the contrast strongly 
depends on experimental parameters.

14
00:00:55,705 --> 00:01:00,512
So if we look at an image measured 
25 milliseconds after the excitation,

15
00:01:00,512 --> 00:01:01,731
this is what it looks like.

16
00:01:01,731 --> 00:01:04,462
This is a sagittal cut through the head.

17
00:01:04,462 --> 00:01:06,762
We have, the nose is roughly here.

18
00:01:06,762 --> 00:01:09,463
The back of the head is here,
so the head is a bit tilted.

19
00:01:09,463 --> 00:01:12,063
This is what the image looks like.

20
00:01:12,063 --> 00:01:13,983
If we look at it after 50 milliseconds,

21
00:01:13,983 --> 00:01:17,351
we have the appearance 
of the head like this.

22
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:22,463
After 75 milliseconds 
and 100 milliseconds.

23
00:01:22,463 --> 00:01:27,473
Notice here how the appearance of the head
considerably changes

24
00:01:27,473 --> 00:01:33,013
as we increase the time after excitation
in intervals of 25 milliseconds.

25
00:01:33,013 --> 00:01:35,451
So this is one parameter 
that we can change.

26
00:01:35,451 --> 00:01:37,470
Here is another example of images

27
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,752
as this parameter, 
time after excitation, is increased--

28
00:01:40,752 --> 00:01:42,762
here very short, two very long.

29
00:01:42,762 --> 00:01:47,782
Here we can only see 
the fluid-filled spaces in the brain.

30
00:01:49,435 --> 00:01:52,483
The next parameters, actually,
two parameters I want to look at

31
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:53,983
is the <i>flip angle alpha</i>--

32
00:01:53,983 --> 00:01:56,282
we've dealt with that last week, 
what this is.

33
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:00,513
This is by how much 
we tilt the magnetization away from <i>z</i>.

34
00:02:00,513 --> 00:02:02,845
So we've taken equilibrium magnetization

35
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:08,443
and we've tilted it away from the <i>z-axis</i>
by this angle alpha, and now it precesses.

36
00:02:08,443 --> 00:02:12,784
And the other parameter 
is the <i>time between excitations TR</i>.

37
00:02:13,464 --> 00:02:16,353
We have, on the vertical access, 
the TR in milliseconds

38
00:02:16,353 --> 00:02:23,164
so this increases 
from 17 milliseconds to 1.25 seconds,

39
00:02:23,164 --> 00:02:27,392
and the flip angle 
increases from 10 to 90 degrees.

40
00:02:27,392 --> 00:02:28,641
What do we notice here?

41
00:02:28,641 --> 00:02:33,411
Well, we do notice that the image,
as we increase the flip angle here,

42
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:36,672
it becomes progressively darker.

43
00:02:36,672 --> 00:02:40,992
And as we increase the TR,
the image becomes progressively brighter,

44
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:42,523
there's more intensity.

45
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:43,872
Here it's a very grayish image.

46
00:02:43,872 --> 00:02:46,513
Here it's essentially a black image.

47
00:02:46,513 --> 00:02:48,964
As a side note, the bright dots 
that we see here,

48
00:02:48,964 --> 00:02:50,948
these are actually blood vessels

49
00:02:50,948 --> 00:02:53,872
where magnetization 
is flowing into the image plane,

50
00:02:53,872 --> 00:02:55,423
but that's a side note.

51
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:58,223
So here, in this matrix, 
we can see that the flip angle

52
00:02:58,223 --> 00:03:01,803
and the time between excitations TR,

53
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:07,193
these two parameters have an interplay 
between each other

54
00:03:07,193 --> 00:03:11,564
and they manipulate the contrast also, 
quite substantially.

55
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:13,744
So we're already at three parameters:

56
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:16,905
time after excitation, 
time between excitations,

57
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:18,095
and the flip angle.

58
00:03:18,095 --> 00:03:22,883
These three parameters, they're all 
under the control of the operator--

59
00:03:22,883 --> 00:03:26,255
of the experimenter that we can change--

60
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:30,344
which can fundamentally 
alter the image contrast.

61
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:35,331
So let's recap what we know 
about <i>magnetic resonance</i> so far.

62
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:37,151
What we have seen is:

63
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:41,247
We need a nucleus with non-zero spin
so we have a magnetic moment,

64
00:03:41,247 --> 00:03:45,920
and we need an external magnetic field
that's generated by our magnet.

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,751
If we have these two ingredients,

66
00:03:47,751 --> 00:03:49,942
we put our subject into the magnet,

67
00:03:49,942 --> 00:03:53,131
then we get a nuclear 
equilibrium magnetization

68
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:55,243
that builds up after a certain time.

69
00:03:55,243 --> 00:03:57,762
We can always picture you
going to the magnet,

70
00:03:57,762 --> 00:04:02,259
and after a while, your body builds up
this nuclear equilibrium magnetization.

71
00:04:02,259 --> 00:04:05,812
Its magnitude is dictated 
by the <i>Boltzmann distribution</i>.

72
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:10,793
This equilibrium magnetization--

73
00:04:10,793 --> 00:04:13,754
the thermodynamic nuclear
equilibrium magnetization--

74
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:17,174
increases with the number 
of the spins in the voxel,

75
00:04:18,384 --> 00:04:20,074
the magnetic field <i>B-zero</i>,

76
00:04:20,074 --> 00:04:23,383
and the gyromagnetic ratio gamma.

77
00:04:24,205 --> 00:04:26,297
So these are three key elements:

78
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:29,336
Number of spins in a voxel,

79
00:04:29,336 --> 00:04:31,256
gyromagnetic ratio gamma--

80
00:04:31,256 --> 00:04:35,488
those are two parameters 
that we have limited control over.

81
00:04:35,488 --> 00:04:37,627
Gyromagnetic ratio 
we have no control over.

82
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:40,815
Number of spins in a voxel,
we can change the size of the voxel--

83
00:04:40,815 --> 00:04:41,909
that can be changed.

84
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:46,487
And the magnetic field is something 
we can experimentally alter.

85
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:49,158
Now if we take 
all of these elements together...

86
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:53,667
then our conclusion is that:

87
00:04:53,667 --> 00:04:58,598
Imaging of the proton--
that is, the hydrogen nucleus in water--

88
00:04:58,598 --> 00:05:00,058
is the most sensitive.

89
00:05:00,715 --> 00:05:03,683
Our body is filled with water
so we have a high number of spins.

90
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:08,186
Water is present in concentrations
of around 40, 50 molar in the body,

91
00:05:08,186 --> 00:05:12,854
so it's about 80 molar protons
in our body.

92
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,754
It has the highest gyromagnetic ratio,

93
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:20,740
so imaging of the proton in water
is the most sensitive way to do imaging.

94
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,696
And that's for most 
practical purposes, but not all.

95
00:05:23,696 --> 00:05:27,545
We will essentially consider 
imaging of water in this course.

96
00:05:28,785 --> 00:05:30,046
We have seen last week

97
00:05:30,046 --> 00:05:33,566
that the thermodynamic 
equilibrium magnetization <i>M-zero</i>

98
00:05:33,566 --> 00:05:35,706
is proportional to <i>B-zero</i>.

99
00:05:36,686 --> 00:05:38,869
So if we look at the equation of motion,

100
00:05:38,869 --> 00:05:42,045
then the derivative of this equilibrium 
magnetization with time

101
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:45,396
is equal to <i>M-zero cross gamma B-zero</i>.

102
00:05:47,437 --> 00:05:50,427
And, frustratingly, this term is zero

103
00:05:50,427 --> 00:05:53,527
so the consequence is 
that the equilibrium magnetization

104
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:57,362
is along <i>z</i> and stays along <i>z</i>--
nothing happens.

105
00:05:57,994 --> 00:06:01,207
And if nothing happens, 
we cannot measure anything,

106
00:06:01,207 --> 00:06:03,776
so we need to induce some changes

107
00:06:03,776 --> 00:06:07,266
since all this 
that we have told you so far--

108
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:10,587
this does not generate 
a measurable signal,

109
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:14,506
so we need to do something
to be able to detect a signal

110
00:06:14,506 --> 00:06:16,506
from our nuclear magnetization.

111
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:19,637
So we need to do something 
to the magnetization

112
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:21,389
to generate a measurable signal

113
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:23,918
because just leaving 
our subject in the magnet

114
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:26,418
will not produce 
something that we can measure.

115
00:06:27,777 --> 00:06:32,568
So first, I want to talk about
how the MR signal is being detected.

116
00:06:32,568 --> 00:06:34,249
What can we detect?

117
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:40,240
And the essential principle 
that lies behind this is shown here.

118
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,569
We have a magnetic dipole
whose position varies in time

119
00:06:45,569 --> 00:06:50,058
and in that surrounding 
conducting structure

120
00:06:50,058 --> 00:06:55,150
there is an electric field
being induced--

121
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,471
a voltage being induced.

122
00:06:56,471 --> 00:07:01,100
And all of this is simply
Faraday's Law of Induction.

123
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:04,499
<i>Faraday's Law of Induction</i> states
that we get a induced voltage,

124
00:07:04,499 --> 00:07:08,690
it is given by the time derivative
of the magnetic flux.

125
00:07:09,227 --> 00:07:12,995
The magnetic flux is given 
by the surface integral of magnetic field

126
00:07:12,995 --> 00:07:14,774
with the surface vector.

127
00:07:14,774 --> 00:07:16,238
So if we look at what this means:

128
00:07:16,238 --> 00:07:21,277
We have the <i>surface vector dA</i> here,
it's perpendicular to the surface,

129
00:07:21,277 --> 00:07:24,645
and what we have in magnetic resonance,
the surface is constant;

130
00:07:24,645 --> 00:07:28,321
we don't change the orientation,
so this is a constant.

131
00:07:28,321 --> 00:07:33,541
And so, basically, the induced 
voltage in the coil that we have here

132
00:07:33,541 --> 00:07:38,234
is proportional to the change 
in magnetic field with time.

133
00:07:40,004 --> 00:07:41,801
We have <i>Lenz's Law</i> to consider

134
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:47,433
that the voltage is induced voltage 
that produces the current--

135
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:51,315
This produces a magnetic field
that opposes the change in magnetic flux.

136
00:07:51,315 --> 00:07:54,578
And this all is completely 
analogous to power generation

137
00:07:54,578 --> 00:07:57,706
whether we do this motion,
or here in the bicycle...

138
00:07:59,696 --> 00:08:02,218
power generation 
for the light of the bicycle.

139
00:08:02,989 --> 00:08:05,969
And we'll demonstrate this 
in the following experiment.

140
00:08:05,969 --> 00:08:09,269
We'll take two situations

141
00:08:09,269 --> 00:08:13,706
to illustrate the generation of voltage

142
00:08:15,206 --> 00:08:17,618
with the change in magnetic flux.

143
00:08:20,218 --> 00:08:22,209
So in this coil I'll turn on the current

144
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,459
and we'll see 
the induced voltage in this coil

145
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,428
as we change the magnetic flux.

146
00:08:26,428 --> 00:08:27,186
I'll turn it on.

147
00:08:27,186 --> 00:08:29,618
We saw a little blip 
that's here on this side.

148
00:08:29,618 --> 00:08:31,228
And then if I move closer,

149
00:08:31,228 --> 00:08:37,156
the movement creates a change 
in magnetic flux on this coil over here.

150
00:08:37,156 --> 00:08:39,496
Likewise, I can take a bar magnet...

151
00:08:41,406 --> 00:08:43,158
and if I move that bar magnet here,

152
00:08:43,158 --> 00:08:45,408
I'll see, already, 
an induced voltage at this distance.

153
00:08:45,408 --> 00:08:47,688
If I'm further away, 
we don't see anything.

154
00:08:47,688 --> 00:08:51,526
And it gets really big 
if we're very close.

155
00:08:51,526 --> 00:08:53,517
And, of course, if I change the polarity,

156
00:08:53,517 --> 00:08:57,198
I'll change the polarity 
of the induced voltage here,

157
00:08:57,198 --> 00:09:00,138
so it goes from both sides
as I turn around.

158
00:09:01,117 --> 00:09:05,427
We have similarly here 
with a magnet in here,

159
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:08,790
I can demonstrate this 
in the following fashion:

160
00:09:09,419 --> 00:09:12,020
So if I move the magnet in here,

161
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,018
depending on the motion,
direction of the motion,

162
00:09:14,018 --> 00:09:17,930
the <i>flux sine</i> will have the LEDs 
that indicate the flow change.

163
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:21,650
If I'm further out, nothing happens
because now we're further away

164
00:09:21,650 --> 00:09:25,601
and with the <i>Biot–Savart Law</i>,
this induces a lower voltage.

165
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:29,949
So that's a demonstration 
of the distance effect

166
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:32,229
of the change in magnetic flux

167
00:09:34,064 --> 00:09:35,854
on the induced voltage.

168
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,729
Okay, now we also have to consider

169
00:09:39,729 --> 00:09:42,971
the law of <i>Biot-Savart</i>
which basically says

170
00:09:42,971 --> 00:09:46,199
that the magnetic field 
produced by a current

171
00:09:46,199 --> 00:09:51,499
falls off with the distance squared,
so it's one <i>over R squared</i>.

172
00:09:51,499 --> 00:09:53,778
There is the law of <i>Biot-Savart</i>.

173
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:56,430
So these are the laws of electromagnetism

174
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,010
that we're basing our observations on.

175
00:10:01,230 --> 00:10:03,111
And so, if we take the situation here,

176
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:06,310
we'll take a microscopic bar magnet,

177
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,002
we have the coil that picks up 
the change in magnetic flux,

178
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:14,591
that converts it to a <i>emf</i>.

179
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:18,340
And now we will look at 
what is the induced voltage in this coil.

180
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:23,744
So the induced voltage is illustrated here
with this bar, the magnitude.

181
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:28,296
And now as I rotate this magnet,
the voltage changes...

182
00:10:29,897 --> 00:10:30,966
periodically.

183
00:10:32,988 --> 00:10:36,366
Now, if I increase the distance 
of the magnet from the coil,

184
00:10:36,366 --> 00:10:37,636
what happens now?

185
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,786
We have still the induced voltage,

186
00:10:39,786 --> 00:10:42,358
but due to <i>Biot-Savart's Law</i> here,

187
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:46,028
we are getting a reduced induced voltage.

188
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:48,643
And we will illustrate this interaction--

189
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,238
the distance dependence--

190
00:10:51,238 --> 00:10:54,927
in a small experiment 
that we have prepared for you.

191
00:10:56,417 --> 00:10:57,718
Okay, so what we have here is,

192
00:10:57,718 --> 00:11:01,197
we have coils, 
we have the magnet here in blue.

193
00:11:01,197 --> 00:11:02,698
The coil, as I turn it...

194
00:11:03,962 --> 00:11:08,760
as I turn it sufficiently large,
it is moving the magnetic field.

195
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,459
Therefore, the flux changes

196
00:11:10,459 --> 00:11:14,004
and that produces the current 
that lights the light bulb.

197
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:15,959
This is one situation 
that does not correspond

198
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:18,730
to what we have in magnetic resonance.

199
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:20,749
The situation that we have 
in magnetic resonance

200
00:11:20,749 --> 00:11:22,439
is more like this one.

201
00:11:22,439 --> 00:11:25,698
Here we have the magnet, in green,

202
00:11:25,698 --> 00:11:30,087
and the coils that pick up 
the change in magnetic flux are around it.

203
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:34,178
As I turn this, we will see 
the induced voltage

204
00:11:34,178 --> 00:11:36,486
by the light bulbs up here.

205
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:40,980
So as I turn it, this is like 
the magnetization in magnetic resonance--

206
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:43,620
we have a change in magnetic field flux.

207
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,509
This magnetic field flux 
is picked up by the coils

208
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:48,572
and this produces induced voltage,

209
00:11:48,572 --> 00:11:50,801
and here, in this case, produces light,

210
00:11:50,801 --> 00:11:53,010
which, of course, we can't do with MRI.

211
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,941
Okay, so we have seen 
with a physical bar magnet

212
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:00,922
that when we change its orientation

213
00:12:00,922 --> 00:12:05,282
in a conducting structure,
we induce a voltage,

214
00:12:05,282 --> 00:12:08,731
and as we move this away,
we reduce the voltage.

215
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:13,002
Now the link between a physical 
bar magnet and nuclear magnetization

216
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:17,721
is that it is the same effect; 
it is still <i>Faraday's Law</i>.

217
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:19,023
So we have a magnetization,

218
00:12:19,023 --> 00:12:23,413
so the role of the rotating bar magnet
is taken by the magnetization.

219
00:12:23,413 --> 00:12:26,673
We have, again, our coil here
and the induced voltage--

220
00:12:26,673 --> 00:12:31,834
As the magnetization rotates,
it creates a change in magnetic flux.

221
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,934
The magnetic field 
becomes time-dependent here.

222
00:12:36,994 --> 00:12:39,436
This term is time-dependent,
this term is constant,

223
00:12:39,436 --> 00:12:42,184
so we have a magnetic flux 
that changes with time,

224
00:12:42,184 --> 00:12:45,455
and this induces a voltage in the coil.

225
00:12:46,188 --> 00:12:49,254
And similarly to the bar magnet,
the analogy here holds very well--

226
00:12:49,254 --> 00:12:52,801
If the magnetization is further away 
from our conducting structure,

227
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:55,976
then the induced voltage 
is substantially reduced.

228
00:12:57,419 --> 00:13:00,397
So if we take this together,

229
00:13:00,397 --> 00:13:04,469
then as we increase the dipole distance

230
00:13:04,469 --> 00:13:08,025
away from our conducting 
structure from this wire,

231
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:10,858
then the induced voltage decreases.

232
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:14,750
In other words, <i>dA emf</i>, 
the electromotive force,

233
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,248
the induced voltage,
decreases with distance

234
00:13:17,248 --> 00:13:20,460
from the rotating magnetization.

235
00:13:21,492 --> 00:13:22,483
Now, on a side note,

236
00:13:22,483 --> 00:13:24,741
how do we generate the <i>RF field B</i>

237
00:13:24,741 --> 00:13:27,980
that we've discussed 
at the end of last week?

238
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:30,290
And this works 
with the following principle:

239
00:13:30,290 --> 00:13:32,061
We have a coil here--

240
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:35,662
it's very often the same coil 
as we have here for detection--

241
00:13:35,662 --> 00:13:38,681
we run a current through it

242
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:42,465
and this current is applied on the coil.

243
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:45,856
Now, this will just generate 
the linear polarized B1 field,

244
00:13:45,856 --> 00:13:49,517
but we can always consider 
any B1 field that's linear

245
00:13:49,517 --> 00:13:54,526
to be a superposition of counter-rotating 
circle of polarized B1 fields,

246
00:13:54,526 --> 00:13:58,607
and one of them is going to precess 
in the right frequency.

247
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,050
So if we have this--

248
00:14:01,050 --> 00:14:03,488
We have the current running in the coil,

249
00:14:03,488 --> 00:14:08,350
then, at this point, we will generate 
a B1 that is indicated here.

250
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,730
If we are further away from the coil--
remember <i>Biot-Savart</i>--

251
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,599
then, in this case, 
the current, being still the same,

252
00:14:16,599 --> 00:14:20,575
but now the B1 field is reduced.

253
00:14:20,575 --> 00:14:24,680
So consequence is: The B1 field 
is strongest closest to the coil

254
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:27,637
and decreases with coil distance.

255
00:14:28,392 --> 00:14:30,511
So the degeneration of the RF field

256
00:14:30,511 --> 00:14:35,321
is the inverse process of detecting
the precession of the magnetization.

257
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:39,473
Here, we run a current through the coil,
this produces a B1 field that rotates,

258
00:14:39,473 --> 00:14:41,652
and this B1 field is the one

259
00:14:45,712 --> 00:14:47,902
that we have discussed
at the end of last week.

260
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:50,512
Okay, so much for the theory.

261
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:55,362
What are the consequences now
for the fact that:

262
00:14:55,362 --> 00:14:58,373
As we are further away 
from the magnetization,

263
00:14:58,373 --> 00:15:00,734
or further away 
from our object of interest,

264
00:15:00,734 --> 00:15:03,864
either B1 or the induced voltage decrease.

265
00:15:05,715 --> 00:15:09,564
In other words, what does 
an <i>MR detector</i> look like?

266
00:15:10,434 --> 00:15:13,073
Well, since distance is so important,

267
00:15:14,466 --> 00:15:19,227
it implies that we have to optimize
the coil geometry, the detector,

268
00:15:19,227 --> 00:15:20,085
so ideally--

269
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:22,384
and this is the physicist's 
view of things--

270
00:15:22,384 --> 00:15:26,536
we'd like to put our object 
into our detector,

271
00:15:26,536 --> 00:15:28,917
and this detector should be 
as tight as possible.

272
00:15:28,917 --> 00:15:31,605
Clearly, the hippo here is not happy,
it's not comfortable,

273
00:15:31,605 --> 00:15:37,938
this is not a situation 
that is ideal for comfort.

274
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:38,837
So what this means--

275
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:40,523
It also means that our detector

276
00:15:40,523 --> 00:15:43,277
is not going to be a detector 
built for the human body

277
00:15:43,277 --> 00:15:45,597
and detect everything from the human body,

278
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:51,217
but it means that we are going to have
a detector for every organ of interest.

279
00:15:51,217 --> 00:15:55,757
Here's an example 
of detectors for the brain.

280
00:15:55,757 --> 00:15:59,858
They look like bird cages, and indeed,
they are also called <i>bird cage</i>.

281
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,628
Here's to give you an idea 
how the subject is placed.

282
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:05,207
Here's a mirror for comfort,
here's the subject's head,

283
00:16:05,207 --> 00:16:09,867
and here is the structure that detects 
and excites the magnetization.

284
00:16:11,648 --> 00:16:13,488
Here are three examples put together--

285
00:16:13,488 --> 00:16:14,759
We have the head coil, again,

286
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,930
we have a <i>breast coil</i> for breast MRI,

287
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,049
and for a <i>pelvic phased-array</i>,

288
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:22,147
it's a coil that's made 
for the lower abdomen.

289
00:16:22,817 --> 00:16:27,269
Here, we have an <i>endorectal coil</i>--
it's a small coil--

290
00:16:27,269 --> 00:16:29,777
and we have a prostate coil.

291
00:16:29,777 --> 00:16:32,499
A prostate is an important disease,

292
00:16:32,499 --> 00:16:34,951
so we want to be as close as possible

293
00:16:34,951 --> 00:16:40,190
with detecting our signal to the organ.

294
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,041
You can imagine--

295
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:44,791
I'll leave that to your imagination
to figure out where this coil is placed

296
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:48,421
to be as close as possible to the organ.

297
00:16:49,101 --> 00:16:51,481
And here's an example with a rat.

298
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:53,051
So for the rat brain--

299
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:55,481
Here's the rat, here's the brain,

300
00:16:55,481 --> 00:16:59,461
and here's the detector that's the coil
that was placed on its brain

301
00:16:59,461 --> 00:17:00,952
for optimal sensitivity.

302
00:17:00,952 --> 00:17:03,382
Clearly, taking such a small subject

303
00:17:03,382 --> 00:17:07,731
into the detection 
of a brain coil or a head coil

304
00:17:07,731 --> 00:17:09,974
does not make sense 
at all because there,

305
00:17:09,974 --> 00:17:12,881
the conducting structures 
are too far away.
