1
00:00:04,586 --> 00:00:08,616
So far we have dealt with the fact
that when we go into a magnet

2
00:00:08,616 --> 00:00:11,587
there's an equilibrium
nuclear magnetization that develops.

3
00:00:11,707 --> 00:00:14,706
We have discussed 
on how we can get this magnetization

4
00:00:14,706 --> 00:00:16,396
into the transverse plane.

5
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:21,788
Now, we know Boltzmann rules, 
Boltzmann is always right.

6
00:00:21,883 --> 00:00:26,006
So we know after we have a applied
our <i>B_1</i> field,

7
00:00:26,113 --> 00:00:28,272
we tipped the magnetization
transverse plane.

8
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,282
It's not going to stay there forever.

9
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:37,706
It will eventually at some point
return to the equilibrium magnetization.

10
00:00:39,056 --> 00:00:44,086
This return to equilibrium magnetization
is what I will discuss in this section.

11
00:00:45,086 --> 00:00:48,165
Let’s talk about --
we have thermodynamic equilibrium.

12
00:00:48,625 --> 00:00:53,265
We have a magnetization, 
equilibrium magnetization along that.

13
00:00:54,062 --> 00:00:58,273
We’ll apply now a <i>B_1</i> field 
on this magnetization.

14
00:00:58,646 --> 00:01:03,746
This is done by RF pulses or pulse,

15
00:01:03,746 --> 00:01:08,688
or multiple RF pulses 
mediated by the RF field <i>B_1</i>.

16
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,247
Now, we look at the situation. 
What happens after excitation?

17
00:01:14,247 --> 00:01:15,936
Here’s the <i>B_1</i>.

18
00:01:16,928 --> 00:01:20,376
After excitation, our magnetization
is in the transverse plane.

19
00:01:20,462 --> 00:01:23,993
This is for excitation 
in 90-degree pulse.

20
00:01:24,141 --> 00:01:26,800
Now, in this situation,
as you’ve noticed here,

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,589
we have no longer 
a <i>z</i> magnetization.

22
00:01:28,589 --> 00:01:30,209
Magnetization is no longer present.

23
00:01:30,278 --> 00:01:33,167
We have a transverse magnetization.

24
00:01:33,167 --> 00:01:36,438
Now, what happens after this excitation?

25
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:40,287
We know that the transverse component
has to disappear

26
00:01:40,287 --> 00:01:42,928
and a longitudinal component
has to build up.

27
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:46,742
This is described by a process 
that’s called relaxation.

28
00:01:46,742 --> 00:01:49,505
There are two time constants
that are affiliated with it

29
00:01:49,505 --> 00:01:51,484
that we will discuss shortly.

30
00:01:51,704 --> 00:01:53,915
The transverse component decays,

31
00:01:53,915 --> 00:01:57,445
and the longitudinal component 
builds up again along <i>z</i>,

32
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:00,873
that [inaudible] 
the equilibrium magnetization.

33
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:04,280
This process of relaxation,

34
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,840
the reestablishment of thermodynamic
equilibrium magnetization

35
00:02:09,134 --> 00:02:11,227
has a phenomenological description.

36
00:02:11,407 --> 00:02:15,446
For the transverse magnetization,
we’ll consider here <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axis,

37
00:02:15,493 --> 00:02:18,082
and we’ll now look at,
on the resonance that is,

38
00:02:18,082 --> 00:02:21,655
we are rotating with a Larmor frequency
of the magnetization.

39
00:02:21,655 --> 00:02:28,845
We have the change in magnetization
is proportional to the magnetization itself,

40
00:02:28,935 --> 00:02:31,528
same for the <i>y</i> magnetization.

41
00:02:31,528 --> 00:02:35,566
These two expressions are actually 
fairly similar to what we’ve had

42
00:02:35,566 --> 00:02:37,776
for the linear attenuation coefficient.

43
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:40,627
So we have the same 
mathematical solution here

44
00:02:40,627 --> 00:02:42,277
as we have dealt there,

45
00:02:42,277 --> 00:02:47,398
and we are getting an exponential decay
of the transverse magnetization.

46
00:02:49,007 --> 00:02:52,297
Our transverse magnetization – 
this is a solution of this equation,

47
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:56,088
it's now right here <i>x y</i> 
instead of each individual component,

48
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:58,268
which just means 
any transverse component

49
00:02:58,268 --> 00:03:03,648
is given by the transverse 
magnetization at zero times <i>e ^(- t / T_2)</i>.

50
00:03:04,727 --> 00:03:06,617
This is phenomenological <i>T_2</i>.

51
00:03:06,617 --> 00:03:09,276
There are a lot of calculations 
in trying to tease out

52
00:03:09,276 --> 00:03:13,637
from the theory how this <i>T_2</i>
is being calculated.

53
00:03:13,637 --> 00:03:19,587
For us, it suffices to accept this 
as a phenomenological constant.

54
00:03:19,587 --> 00:03:22,868
I will in the following 
give you a rationale

55
00:03:22,868 --> 00:03:27,709
what influences this decay time <i>T_2</i>.

56
00:03:29,027 --> 00:03:31,888
What are the mechanisms of relaxation?

57
00:03:31,888 --> 00:03:33,547
Essentially, what we’re dealing with here

58
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:37,828
is the fact that our molecules 
are not static, that they move.

59
00:03:37,828 --> 00:03:40,629
We have, for example, Brownian motion.

60
00:03:40,629 --> 00:03:44,088
Now, if you have a molecule that moves,

61
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:49,181
the motion in the magnetic field 
will create local oscillating

62
00:03:49,181 --> 00:03:51,188
or fluctuating magnetic fields.

63
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:53,397
They are small. You can easily picture this.

64
00:03:53,397 --> 00:03:56,078
Here’s a molecule 
that kind of tumbles here.

65
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:57,748
We have a magnetic field,

66
00:03:57,748 --> 00:04:01,439
and we can certainly envisage 
that this molecule on a local level,

67
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,289
on atomic level, or molecular level 
has a non-constant magnetic field.

68
00:04:07,379 --> 00:04:10,190
There are some perturbations 
to the main magnetic field

69
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,699
that are time-dependent.

70
00:04:12,692 --> 00:04:16,551
In addition to the <i>B_0</i>, 
which is on the order of Teslas,

71
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:19,000
one gets a small fluctuating 
magnetic field.

72
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:25,131
It is small, but it’s randomly fluctuating
that is acting on the nucleus.

73
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:31,470
This field depends on the orientation
of the molecule,

74
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:36,562
and also, how it behaves 
is described by the correlation time, <i>τ_C</i>.

75
00:04:36,562 --> 00:04:40,602
The correlation time is defined 
as the time for a molecule to rotate

76
00:04:40,602 --> 00:04:43,432
by about 1 radian.

77
00:04:43,432 --> 00:04:49,018
It essentially is a way also to say 
it is a measure of how long the motion

78
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:52,668
between two molecules, for example,
is correlated.

79
00:04:53,903 --> 00:04:58,355
Now, what are some sources
of this fluctuating field?

80
00:04:58,355 --> 00:05:00,664
We have coupling between dipoles

81
00:05:00,664 --> 00:05:03,220
of the nucleus of interest 
and the solvent.

82
00:05:03,224 --> 00:05:06,363
So if we take, for example,
glucose in water

83
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:09,002
and the glucose molecule will interact
with the water.

84
00:05:12,122 --> 00:05:15,794
Here’s our nucleus of interest 
and in blue is the solvent,

85
00:05:15,794 --> 00:05:19,173
or we have interactions between 
nuclear magnetic dipoles.

86
00:05:19,173 --> 00:05:24,102
That’s another source 
of this local fluctuating magnetic field.

87
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:27,744
If you have a water molecule
and another water molecule,

88
00:05:27,744 --> 00:05:31,273
then the two dipoles 
which are not perfectly aligned,

89
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:36,224
and they will interact and create
this local magnetic field.

90
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:40,385
It is useful here to consider
the correlation function,

91
00:05:40,385 --> 00:05:43,194
which is given by this correlation time.

92
00:05:43,194 --> 00:05:47,474
The correlation function is <i>e ^ (- t / τ_C)</i>.

93
00:05:47,474 --> 00:05:51,696
This function essentially describes 
the correlation of motion

94
00:05:51,696 --> 00:05:53,595
that is <i>t</i> seconds apart.

95
00:05:54,095 --> 00:05:56,075
It’s dependent on this correlation time.

96
00:05:56,075 --> 00:05:59,805
What I’m getting at here is the parameter
is the correlation time

97
00:05:59,805 --> 00:06:05,264
because that correlation time depends 
on a number of things that we know.

98
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:06,937
One of them, viscosity.

99
00:06:06,937 --> 00:06:08,996
This is easily envisageable.

100
00:06:08,996 --> 00:06:11,594
If you take the sugar molecule
in our blood,

101
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:14,755
this sugar molecule 
will come more fairly fast.

102
00:06:14,755 --> 00:06:16,247
So the correlation time is short.

103
00:06:16,247 --> 00:06:21,056
If you take the same sugar molecule
in honey--honey has a very high viscosity

104
00:06:21,056 --> 00:06:25,571
so there that sugar molecule 
will move less,

105
00:06:25,571 --> 00:06:28,091
so the correlation time will be longer.

106
00:06:28,711 --> 00:06:31,838
Then it makes also sense 
that, as temperature decreases,

107
00:06:31,838 --> 00:06:36,186
the correlation time increases 
because essentially at 0 Kelvin,

108
00:06:36,186 --> 00:06:38,378
we froze and we don’t move at all.

109
00:06:39,057 --> 00:06:44,672
Finally, that it is somehow dependent 
on the radius of the molecule

110
00:06:44,672 --> 00:06:46,092
makes also sense.

111
00:06:46,092 --> 00:06:50,486
It takes just much more thermal energy
to rotate the big macromolecule

112
00:06:50,486 --> 00:06:53,667
as compared to a small glucose molecule.

113
00:06:54,302 --> 00:06:58,918
This correlation time 
has some molecular effects in there,

114
00:07:00,568 --> 00:07:03,948
some properties of the molecule itself.

115
00:07:05,663 --> 00:07:12,436
Relaxation has in large part to do 
with microscopic motion, random motion

116
00:07:12,463 --> 00:07:15,702
that generates a randomly varying
magnetic field,

117
00:07:15,702 --> 00:07:18,944
and this has a lot to do 
with molecular properties

118
00:07:18,944 --> 00:07:20,443
of the molecules.

119
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:27,618
Now, how does a locally varying 
magnetic field that fluctuates

120
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:30,643
cause a loss 
of transverse magnetization?

121
00:07:31,827 --> 00:07:36,327
We will deal with <i>T_2</i> largely 
as a phenomenological time constant.

122
00:07:36,327 --> 00:07:37,684
But in this little example

123
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:42,794
I want to give you some rationalization
on how this <i>T_2</i>, this decay time

124
00:07:42,794 --> 00:07:44,775
for the transverse magnetization

125
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:48,695
and how that is influenced 
by molecular events.

126
00:07:49,369 --> 00:07:51,588
First, to give us an idea 
what we’re talking about,

127
00:07:51,588 --> 00:07:55,208
the <i>T_2</i> ranges from typically 
on the order of microseconds,

128
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:59,269
10 microseconds in bone 
to several seconds in water.

129
00:08:00,369 --> 00:08:05,419
<i>T_2</i> is also called 
the transverse relaxation, <i>T_2</i> relaxation.

130
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:10,642
The underlying cause 
is molecular dynamics

131
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:12,692
and spin-spin interactions.

132
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:17,803
If you have nearby spins
and depending on how the molecule moves,

133
00:08:17,803 --> 00:08:24,613
this will influence the magnitude 
of this relaxation constant.

134
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:29,094
It has also been called historically 
"spin-spin relaxation"

135
00:08:29,094 --> 00:08:34,054
because it is based, to a large extent,
on interactions between spins.

136
00:08:35,975 --> 00:08:40,254
This leads to a loss of signal 
in the <i>x y</i> plane.

137
00:08:40,894 --> 00:08:43,774
It’s also called "memory relaxation."

138
00:08:44,195 --> 00:08:47,386
How does this lead to this loss
in magnetization

139
00:08:47,386 --> 00:08:50,246
that we phenomenologically described 
by the exponential decay?

140
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:55,465
Let’s look at a situation after excitation.

141
00:08:56,476 --> 00:08:59,987
We have a transverse magnetization,
we have now [afflicted] around <i>x</i>

142
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:01,345
with the <i>B_1</i> field.

143
00:09:01,345 --> 00:09:04,335
We’ve tipped it to magnetization along <i>y</i>.

144
00:09:05,985 --> 00:09:11,555
If now you can see that your voxel
as composed of little sub-voxels

145
00:09:11,555 --> 00:09:14,957
and in each of the sub-voxels,
your magnetic field

146
00:09:14,957 --> 00:09:20,545
that the nucleus spins experience
is identical for all in nuclear sub-voxels.

147
00:09:21,075 --> 00:09:23,168
Nothing of interest will happen.

148
00:09:23,168 --> 00:09:26,047
They will all precess 
with the same Larmor frequency,

149
00:09:26,047 --> 00:09:31,146
and this magnetization vector 
is preserved.

150
00:09:32,028 --> 00:09:36,182
But now, we have random local
magnetic field.

151
00:09:36,182 --> 00:09:37,924
Imitate your voxel in image.

152
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:41,754
Imagine that you've cut it into
tens of thousands sub-voxels,

153
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:43,854
tiny little pockets 
where in each of the pockets

154
00:09:43,854 --> 00:09:45,304
you have a magnitization.

155
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:48,975
A tiny magnetization associated with it,
so sub-voxels, if you will.

156
00:09:49,170 --> 00:09:54,706
Now in your mind
assigned to each of these sub-voxels

157
00:09:54,706 --> 00:09:58,346
a slightly different 
external magnetic field <i>B_0</i>.

158
00:09:59,564 --> 00:10:01,865
Now, what you will get is that 
in your voxel,

159
00:10:01,865 --> 00:10:03,935
these magnetization will now precess

160
00:10:03,935 --> 00:10:08,006
at slightly different Larmor frequencies.

161
00:10:09,016 --> 00:10:11,846
If they have slightly different 
Larmor frequencies

162
00:10:11,846 --> 00:10:14,536
even if you put ourselves 
into the rotating reference frame

163
00:10:14,536 --> 00:10:18,767
of the main Larmor frequency, 
some of them will precess faster,

164
00:10:19,512 --> 00:10:22,996
and some of them will precess slower
in that rotating reference frame.

165
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:25,660
If they don’t precess exactly 
at the same frequency,

166
00:10:25,692 --> 00:10:29,920
that means between these magnetizations,
an angle will build up.

167
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:36,590
And this is in this looping animation here
that we have this build-up of the angle

168
00:10:38,265 --> 00:10:42,337
between the magnetizations 
that produces...

169
00:10:46,557 --> 00:10:49,997
...the dephasing of the spins

170
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:55,904
and therefore, a reduction 
as they lose the same orientation.

171
00:10:56,105 --> 00:11:02,386
The effective transverse magnetization 
that we measure is reduced.

172
00:11:05,347 --> 00:11:07,687
We have a rule of thumb for water.

173
00:11:07,687 --> 00:11:13,380
That means the less the water 
is in contact with tissue,

174
00:11:13,380 --> 00:11:18,179
be it bone, be it membranes, 
be it proteins, et cetera,

175
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:21,315
the longer is the bulk water <i>T_2</i>.

176
00:11:21,315 --> 00:11:24,564
The purer the water,
the longer is the <i>T_2</i>.

177
00:11:25,044 --> 00:11:27,453
The longest <i>T_2</i> 
that you can have for water

178
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:30,023
is degassed, demineralized water.

179
00:11:32,013 --> 00:11:35,606
How does this T2 relate
to the correlation time?

180
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,332
Any of these things increases 
a correlation time of water.

181
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:43,042
If you look over a voxel, 
we have the density of our spins

182
00:11:43,042 --> 00:11:46,943
times the local fluctuation 
in the magnetic field with time

183
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:49,738
times the correlation time.

184
00:11:49,738 --> 00:11:55,640
If our correlation time increases,
then this term here increases over <i>τ_C</i>,

185
00:11:56,070 --> 00:12:00,019
and so we get a faster 
differential precession

186
00:12:00,826 --> 00:12:03,929
along with differential precession 
until the molecules reorient

187
00:12:04,042 --> 00:12:06,373
and this goes to zero faster.

188
00:12:08,413 --> 00:12:12,547
And here's another major conclusion.

189
00:12:12,547 --> 00:12:15,773
If your object of interest, 
your molecule of interest

190
00:12:15,773 --> 00:12:18,453
has a long correlation time,

191
00:12:18,453 --> 00:12:22,454
it accrues a lot of phase difference
over this correlation time.

192
00:12:22,454 --> 00:12:24,575
This results in a short <i>T_2</i>.

193
00:12:25,215 --> 00:12:29,215
That is important and the conclusion is

194
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:31,615
this one, this is 
the take-home message here.

195
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:34,224
Bone, membranes, proteins,

196
00:12:34,224 --> 00:12:38,486
for intents and purpose 
of biomedical imaging, they are invisible.

197
00:12:38,486 --> 00:12:43,255
That means, although they carry
magnetization, it decays so fast

198
00:12:43,255 --> 00:12:45,775
that we cannot practically measure it.

199
00:12:47,834 --> 00:12:49,226
Here’s an example.

200
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:53,763
We have a transverse magnetization
in cerebrospinal fluid of the brain.

201
00:12:53,902 --> 00:12:56,886
There is hardly any proteins. 
This decays the slowest.

202
00:12:57,043 --> 00:13:01,055
The <i>T_2</i> is 1.4 seconds. 
We have grey matter.

203
00:13:01,055 --> 00:13:04,495
It’s 100 milliseconds, 90 milliseconds
is white matter

204
00:13:04,495 --> 00:13:07,824
and that, for other reasons,
has an even shorter <i>T_2</i>.

205
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:13,167
These are some examples here 
for the relaxation that they are,

206
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:15,882
because of the differential environment

207
00:13:15,882 --> 00:13:18,361
and the interactions 
at the water molecule has

208
00:13:18,361 --> 00:13:19,982
on a molecular level,

209
00:13:19,982 --> 00:13:22,232
these interactions are different
for different tissues.

210
00:13:22,232 --> 00:13:27,002
And that is a source for changes in <i>T_2</i> 
between different tissues.

211
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:31,722
Now, we have said,
for relaxation to occur

212
00:13:31,722 --> 00:13:35,322
and for the thermodynamic equilibrium
magnetization to be re-established,

213
00:13:35,322 --> 00:13:38,945
we have to re-establish 
the magnetization along <i>z</i>

214
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:41,063
to get to the equilibrium magnetization.

215
00:13:41,176 --> 00:13:46,026
And so, there is also something happening
with the longitudinal magnetization,

216
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:48,387
the magnetization along <i>z</i>.

217
00:13:49,748 --> 00:13:52,657
So, we consider that we have excited
our magnitization

218
00:13:52,657 --> 00:13:53,858
to the transverse plane.

219
00:13:53,858 --> 00:13:57,668
The transverse magnetization, <i>M_ x_y</i>
has decayed by T2,

220
00:13:58,158 --> 00:14:03,228
and now our <i>z</i> magnetization, 
which is zero , has to be reconsittuted

221
00:14:03,228 --> 00:14:06,530
and approach 
the equilibrium magnetization.

222
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:10,261
And this is described 
by the longitudinal relaxation

223
00:14:10,261 --> 00:14:12,974
which happens along the <i>z</i> axis,

224
00:14:12,974 --> 00:14:16,745
and this is governed 
by this differential equation here.

225
00:14:16,745 --> 00:14:20,807
So we have the time derivative
of the <i>z</i> magnetization component

226
00:14:20,807 --> 00:14:23,835
is given by something

227
00:14:23,903 --> 00:14:28,704
minus the <i>z</i> magnetization
times the constant.

228
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:33,288
So, if we have the derivative of something
equals to something of that derivative

229
00:14:33,288 --> 00:14:41,123
and a constant, it makes sense to consider
an exponential solution here as well.

230
00:14:41,709 --> 00:14:45,448
Let’s first, however, look at 
what happens after <i>T_2</i> relaxation.

231
00:14:45,448 --> 00:14:48,769
We have no <i>z</i> magnetization,
so it is zero.

232
00:14:51,658 --> 00:14:55,698
The solution to this equation here
is given by this solution here.

233
00:14:55,938 --> 00:14:59,680
You can verify by plotting this term
in here, doing the derivation

234
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,401
that this is indeed the solution.

235
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,583
If we said, <i>t = 0</i>,

236
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:07,061
then we have <i>M_z (0) = M_z (0)</i>,
so that works.

237
00:15:07,061 --> 00:15:11,797
If we set <i>t</i> to infinity, <i>t / T_1</i>, 
this goes to zero, this goes to zero,

238
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:15,206
then we have <i>M_0</i>, 
so it’s the right behavior.

239
00:15:16,986 --> 00:15:20,286
What this means is that 
after we have had <i>T_2</i> relaxation,

240
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:24,010
we have no nuclear magnetization 
in our sample.

241
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:27,746
And as <i>T_1</i> relaxation, this equation here
on the left works,

242
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:33,647
the <i>z</i> magnetization is reconstituted
until the equilibrium <i>z</i> magnetization.

243
00:15:34,798 --> 00:15:37,555
Now, what are the mechanisms 
for <i>T_1</i> relaxation?

244
00:15:37,613 --> 00:15:42,754
They again have a lot to do 
with molecular motion,

245
00:15:42,754 --> 00:15:45,036
its incoherent fluctuations,

246
00:15:45,036 --> 00:15:50,704
and it has to do a lot with 
how these fluctuations, the motion,

247
00:15:50,704 --> 00:15:56,315
the molecular fluctuations are close 
to the Larmor frequency.

248
00:15:57,494 --> 00:16:01,278
Remember, a change 
in thermodynamic equilibrium magnetization

249
00:16:01,278 --> 00:16:03,858
is associated with the change 
in energy transfer

250
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:05,498
between the energy levels

251
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:08,850
in the higher and lower energy diagram.

252
00:16:09,657 --> 00:16:13,109
It has therefore been also 
historically called spin-lattice relaxation

253
00:16:13,109 --> 00:16:18,461
because one can consider the spin pool
as a thermally isolated pool

254
00:16:18,461 --> 00:16:21,330
and the heat is lost to the surroundings.

255
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,101
Remember, if we have a 90-degree pulse,

256
00:16:24,159 --> 00:16:27,659
we have equal distribution of the spins
in upper and lower energy level.

257
00:16:27,659 --> 00:16:31,899
This corresponds technically 
to a temperature of infinity,

258
00:16:31,899 --> 00:16:34,569
so the spin system has to cool down.

259
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:38,156
Incidentally, this by the way 
has been used,

260
00:16:38,156 --> 00:16:40,228
manipulation of nuclear magnetization

261
00:16:40,228 --> 00:16:42,475
has been used at a very low temperature

262
00:16:42,995 --> 00:16:48,117
to further cool a sample 
by working with heat and exchange

263
00:16:48,117 --> 00:16:51,625
between the lattice and the spin system.

264
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:56,407
To give an idea what the <i>T_1</i> is,
it’s typically between 0.5 and 5 seconds.

265
00:16:57,187 --> 00:17:00,677
The longest is for water, 
5 seconds value that’s pure,

266
00:17:00,677 --> 00:17:02,797
degassed, demineralized water.

267
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:09,428
We have at the time, 
after 90-degree magnetization,

268
00:17:09,428 --> 00:17:11,359
we have no <i>z</i> magnetization.

269
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:14,807
So the population distribution 
is equal in the two energy levels.

270
00:17:14,807 --> 00:17:17,689
This corresponds 
to a temperature of infinity.

271
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:23,319
We draw the two energy levels here, 
lower and higher energy level,

272
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:27,320
here’s our energy difference 
governed here,

273
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:32,066
and this would be at 0 Kelvin,

274
00:17:32,127 --> 00:17:35,014
we have a mole in the lower energy state.

275
00:17:35,014 --> 00:17:39,643
And we’ll take here an extreme drawing
that is our equilibrium magnetization

276
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,215
that we have at the beginning.

277
00:17:42,681 --> 00:17:45,421
We start out 
with equilibrium magnetization,

278
00:17:45,421 --> 00:17:47,191
and when we do a 90-degree flip,

279
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:51,021
we have equal population 
in the higher and lower energy level,

280
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:54,307
which corresponds to infinite temperature.

281
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:58,453
Now, we wait, <i>T_1</i> relaxation is happening,

282
00:17:58,453 --> 00:18:02,402
and the spins that are in excess
in the higher energy level

283
00:18:02,402 --> 00:18:06,811
eventually return back 
to the lower energy level

284
00:18:06,811 --> 00:18:09,680
until the Boltzmann distribution 
is re-established.

285
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:13,612
Then we have thermodynamic 
equilibrium magnetization,

286
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:18,957
which is dictated 
by the Boltzmann distribution here.

287
00:18:18,957 --> 00:18:23,598
And <i>1 / 82 = e ^ (-Δ E / k T)</i>.

288
00:18:24,628 --> 00:18:27,448
Now, this change in energy level,

289
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:30,778
the spins that are in the higher level 
that are in excess,

290
00:18:30,778 --> 00:18:32,559
they have to go to the lower energy level.

291
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:35,157
In doing so, they have to give off energy.

292
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:38,307
This is essentially done 
by transfer of energy

293
00:18:38,307 --> 00:18:42,438
from the spins to the system,
and the system here is the lattice.

294
00:18:42,438 --> 00:18:46,549
It is done by photon transfer,
but it is done thermally.

295
00:18:48,229 --> 00:18:54,088
This energy transfer is most efficient 
if the motion of the system,

296
00:18:54,088 --> 00:18:58,509
that is, frequency 
with which the system fluctuates,

297
00:18:58,509 --> 00:19:02,130
the energy fluctuates, 
matches the energy difference here

298
00:19:02,130 --> 00:19:03,341
between the energy levels.

299
00:19:03,341 --> 00:19:05,639
We want to give off the quantum of photon.

300
00:19:05,639 --> 00:19:09,047
We can only give it off the energy
in form of exactly,

301
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:13,596
this energy difference.

302
00:19:13,896 --> 00:19:15,800
This happens most effectively

303
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,409
if the motion has that frequency
in it as well.

304
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:22,120
If the motion of the molecule

305
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:27,232
largely does not correspond 
to the frequency

306
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:31,050
of energy difference here, 
this <i>Δ E</i> here,

307
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,730
then where do the photons go?

308
00:19:32,730 --> 00:19:34,685
They cannot be easily given off.

309
00:19:34,685 --> 00:19:37,039
That’s the intuitive description here.

310
00:19:37,703 --> 00:19:40,803
This basically means 
that the Larmor frequency

311
00:19:40,803 --> 00:19:43,333
times the correlation time
should be roughly 1.

312
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:45,793
Then we have the most efficient transfer.

313
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:47,528
The most efficient transfer means

314
00:19:47,528 --> 00:19:51,238
that we have a minimal 
<i>T_1</i> relaxation time.

315
00:19:53,348 --> 00:19:57,753
Now, if we have solid state like bone 
or plastics, or cement,

316
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:02,015
or anything, or teeth, 
then the correlation time is very long.

317
00:20:02,015 --> 00:20:04,549
The <i>ω τ_C</i> is much larger than 1.

318
00:20:04,549 --> 00:20:08,950
Then we have a <i>T_1</i> 
on the order of seconds to minutes.

319
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:12,238
You take water and you freeze it down
to a few Kelvin of temperature.

320
00:20:12,238 --> 00:20:14,488
You measure the <i>T_1</i>.

321
00:20:15,258 --> 00:20:16,578
In that situation,

322
00:20:16,578 --> 00:20:20,440
that <i>T_1</i> is in the order 
of tens of thousands of seconds.

323
00:20:20,670 --> 00:20:25,808
It’s very long because there is no motion 
close to the Larmor frequency

324
00:20:25,808 --> 00:20:29,541
of our magnetization.

325
00:20:30,760 --> 00:20:34,800
To sum up here the relaxation of <i>T_1</i>,

326
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:37,749
there’s also a rule of thumb 
that is useful for us to know.

327
00:20:38,709 --> 00:20:42,150
It is very similar to what we had for <i>T_2</i>.

328
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:47,441
Basically means the purer the <i>T_2</i> ,
the purer the water is,

329
00:20:47,441 --> 00:20:50,920
so there’s less other molecules 
at the water interact,

330
00:20:51,851 --> 00:20:54,504
the longer is the <i>T_1</i>.

331
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:59,481
The more there are like membranes, 
proteins, et cetera

332
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:02,421
with which the bulk water 
can come in contact,

333
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:04,410
the shorter is the <i>T_1</i>.

334
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:10,550
That’s the rule of thumb for tissue
that is useful to remember.
