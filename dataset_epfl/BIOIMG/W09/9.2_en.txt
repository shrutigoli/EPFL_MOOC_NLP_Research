So now I want to review the rotating frame description of the magnetization because this is really important that we have a good grasp of this description.
So, the equation of motion for the magnetization has to be valid in any reference frame in the presence of a magnetic field is given by the Larmor equation which states that the magnetization precesses around <i>delta B</i> effective with the frequency
<i>gamma delta B</i> effective.
If the <i>B</i> effective is along <i>z</i>, then this means that the magnetization will precess in the <i>xy</i> plane with a frequency that's given by <i>gamma delta B</i> effective over <i>2 pi</i>.
Now, let's re-look at the rotating reference frame.
So we have a reference frame that rotates around <i>z</i>, about<i> z,</i> with a frame frequency <i>omega RF.</i>
Let's take the first case: 
The rotating reference frame does not rotate.
That's the lab frame; that's what-- our reference frame.
So, <i>omega RF</i> is zero.
In this case, the magnetization precesses in the <i>xy</i> plane with a frequency
<i>gamma B 0</i> over <i>2 pi.</i>
So, if you take the reference frame here, we have the <i>B-zero</i> here; we have our magnetization here.
We're just putting the magnetization at a certain angle, so we're just looking at the component that's transverse.
That's effect -- this component here, the component that's perpendicular to <i>B-zero</i> does not precess.
So this magnetization here, the transverse magnetization will precess with a angular velocity <i>omega-l.</i>
So it will -- this angle will increase with <i>omega-l-t,</i> it goes around <i>B-zero,</i> encircles the transverse component.
So if we take the transverse component, then the transverse component will simply do this motion.
That's the Larmor equation in the non-rotating reference frame.
Now we'll take the second case, and that is the rotating reference frame.
And now we'll place ourselves into the rotating reference frame that rotates exactly with the Larmor frequency.
In this rotating frame, as we are rotating exactly with the magnetization, this magnetization is, by definition, stationary.
It does not move, or in other words, it precesses in <i>xy</i> with zero frequency.
Now, the equation of motion that we have up here still has to be valid in this reference frame.
So, the precession frequency is equal to <i>gamma</i>-<i>delta-B</i> effective over <i>2-pi</i>, or in this case, the <i>delta-B</i>-effective will be zero.
And our magnetization will do this motion, namely, none, because we are in the reference frame where it doesn't move.
Now, the Larmor frequency in [inaudible], in the rotating reference frame is given by <i>gamma</i>-<i>delta-B</i>-effective, and this <i>gamma-delta-B</i> -- this <i>delta-B</i>-effective is given by <i>B-zero</i> minus <i>omega-R-F</i> over <i>gamma</i>.
So what this means is we are to get from here to the lab frame, to the rotating reference frame that rotates with a Larmor frequency, what we have had to do to still have the equation work, we have to subtract a fictitious magnetic field which in this case equals to <i>omega-L</i> over <i>gamma</i> and <i>omega-L</i> is <i>gamma-B-zero</i>, so the <i>delta-B</i>-effective was <i>B-zero</i> minus <i>B-zero</i> equals <i>zero</i>.
But this holds true for any <i>omega-R-F </i> for any angular velocity of a rotating reference frame, and we can calculate a <i>delta-B</i>-effective.
Now here, I want to make a short digression into quantum mechanics.
Not what we strictly need quantum mechanics for understanding most of the MRI principles.
We can actually work very much with a classical principle.
But we want to remind ourselves that magnetic resonance is a quantum mechanical manifestation.
It is a property, comes out of quantum mechanics.
Quantum mechanics is the proper way of describing things, and what I want to do here is build a bridge between our description, classical description, and the quantum mechanical theory that's behind this.
So let's look at the SchrÃ¶dinger representation.
We have the derivative of the cat is equals to the Hamiltonians times the cat, and if the Hamiltonian is constant in time, then we can write the solution very simply.
The expectation value of a operator<i> I-z</i> is given by this term here in the SchrÃ¶dinger representation.
So this is all standard theory from quantum mechanics.
Now, we have some equivalencies here, and that is the magnetization along <i>z</i> is the expectation value of the operator <i>I-z,</i> magnetization along <i>x</i>, that of <i>i-x</i>, and the magnetization along <i>y</i>, the expectation value of <i>I-y.</i>
So in other words, our macroscopic quantities that we observe the magnetization are the expectation values of the quantum mechanical operators associated.
So, this is very nice.
So, for a spin one-half that's a hydrogen nucleus at the proton, we have two energy levels, so we have -- this is the operator for <i>I-z, I-x,</i> and <i>I-y.</i>
These are the Pauli spin matrices that describe the system.
Now, how do we determine the time dependence of <i>I-x,</i> that is of the <i>m-x</i> magnetization?
And the way this is done here is we split the Hamiltonian into time-invariant and time-dependent terms.
So we can write our SchrÃ¶dinger equation here.
We'll split the Hamiltonian, this term here, into time-invariant term here and a time-dependent term.
And then we impose that the time-invariant term is much bigger.
Its eigenvalues are much bigger than those of the time-dependent term and we'll use here now the interaction representation, which comes from higher order perturbation theory.
And if we do that, the transformation that is being done that comes out of this theory is that we have now the cat in the interaction representation and we will now enter this condition the representation equation of motion for the wave function becomes this term here.
And we have now the <i>V</i> of <i>t</i> is transferred to the<i> V</i> in the interaction representation.
This is the transformation given here.
Now for spin, for a nuclear spin, this is all general theory, now, for a nuclear spin, the static Hamiltonian is the one associated to the magnetic field.
That's the one that generates the two energy levels.
Hence, we have <i>I-z</i> here as the operator, and we can take the time-variant Hamiltonian given by this term here.
Now what is this --
How does this transform if you do this transformation here if we use an <i>omega-R-F</i> here in this term here that is equal to <i>gamma-B-zero?</i>
And actually, if we do this transformation we'll find that in the interaction representation, this time-variant term here, which we have in this term here, becomes time-independent.
So, the beauty here is that we have used classically the description in the rotating reference frame to make things stationary.
If we do this in the interaction representation, and we make our Hamiltonian in this representation stationary, we're essentially doing the same thing but in quantum mechanics, and we obtain our stationary Hamiltonian, this is equivalent to putting ourselves into the rotating reference frame.
So we have an additional quantum mechanical equivalent that is the <i>B-zero</i> is along <i>I-z</i> is proportional to the operator<i> I-z</i> at the <i>B-one</i>, and <i>x</i> or <i>y </i> is given by the operator <i>I-x-I-y.</i>
That's what this term here is.
This is the description of the <i>R-F </i>field.
So, this is a short digression into quantum mechanics to remind ourselves that what is behind magnetic resonance is truly a quantum mechanical event.
