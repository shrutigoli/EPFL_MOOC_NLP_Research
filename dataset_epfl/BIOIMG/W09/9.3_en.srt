1
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:07,935
What happens with the motion 
of the magnetization

2
00:00:07,935 --> 00:00:12,143
when we apply such an RF field 
and it induces a flip angle?

3
00:00:12,143 --> 00:00:15,783
Let's look at the laboratory
frame of reference.

4
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:18,163
Then we have the Larmor equation,

5
00:00:18,163 --> 00:00:20,973
which says, derivative 
of the magnetization with time

6
00:00:20,973 --> 00:00:23,783
is equal to "γ" times the magnetic field,

7
00:00:23,783 --> 00:00:25,823
and the magnetic field 
I have conveniently split

8
00:00:25,823 --> 00:00:29,833
into the <i>B_1</i>, which is time-dependent
and <i>B_0</i>, which is constant.

9
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:34,367
Now, what happens is, 
actually in the motion:

10
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:38,727
As we apply the <i>B_1</i>, it rotates with <i>ω_RF</i>.

11
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:42,991
As the <i>B_1</i> is in the transverse plane

12
00:00:44,563 --> 00:00:48,763
and it rotates, the <i>B_0</i>,

13
00:00:50,581 --> 00:00:53,731
the magnetization will start
to deviate from being along <i>z</i>.

14
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:57,871
The minute it starts to deviate 
from being along <i>z</i>,

15
00:00:57,871 --> 00:00:59,501
it will start to precess.

16
00:00:59,501 --> 00:01:01,419
It will precess 
with the Larmor frequency,

17
00:01:01,419 --> 00:01:03,979
which is on the order of 100 megahertz.

18
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:06,225
We have seen with the examples 
for the <i>B_1</i>,

19
00:01:06,225 --> 00:01:08,335
this is on the order of kilohertz.

20
00:01:08,895 --> 00:01:12,795
So this will go 100,000 times 
around in circles

21
00:01:12,795 --> 00:01:15,515
for every rotation that it makes

22
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:22,462
around the field <i>B_1</i>.

23
00:01:24,135 --> 00:01:26,584
So, what happens in the motion is

24
00:01:26,584 --> 00:01:30,174
that we have the <i>B_1</i> field here 
that rotates.

25
00:01:30,174 --> 00:01:31,544
And now what I will describe here

26
00:01:31,544 --> 00:01:33,824
is the motion 
of the transverse magnetization

27
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:35,716
and the longitudinal magnetization,

28
00:01:35,716 --> 00:01:39,556
as we turn on 
this rotating reference frame.

29
00:01:40,396 --> 00:01:43,878
So, we have the <i>B_1</i>
applied that Larmor frequency

30
00:01:43,878 --> 00:01:47,478
in the transverse plane for a time <i>τ</i>,

31
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:51,558
and this will create a nutation 
of the magnetization in a spiral motion,

32
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:53,968
as it tips away from the <i>z</i>-axis.

33
00:01:54,192 --> 00:01:59,352
So, let's look at this in the animation: 
the <i>B_1</i>, the magnetization, rotates

34
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:03,790
so the transverse component increases, 
the longitudinal component decreases,

35
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:05,420
until we are done,

36
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:08,460
and we have done a 90-degree excitation.

37
00:02:10,368 --> 00:02:15,158
Now, remember, the rotation 
is happening 100,000 times

38
00:02:15,158 --> 00:02:17,858
for each rotation 
that we flip the magnetization.

39
00:02:18,727 --> 00:02:22,723
So it's difficult to visualize,
but we will illustrate this effect of <i>B_1</i>

40
00:02:22,723 --> 00:02:27,073
in the experiment that we have done,

41
00:02:27,073 --> 00:02:32,763
again, with a simulation 
of the magnetic resonance effect

42
00:02:34,252 --> 00:02:38,842
with this experiment 
with a yellow magnet that is rotating,

43
00:02:39,337 --> 00:02:41,837
and we will look at this experiment now.

44
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:45,206
<i>So, in this experiment 
we have the same setup</i>

45
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:46,936
<i>as in the experiment I showed last week,</i>

46
00:02:46,936 --> 00:02:50,176
<i>but we have an additional magnet here, 
which produces a magnetic field</i>

47
00:02:50,176 --> 00:02:52,236
<i>that's perpendicular 
to the main magnetic field</i>

48
00:02:52,236 --> 00:02:53,370
<i>which is this way,</i>

49
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,060
<i>and this magnet 
produces a magnetic field this way.</i>

50
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:00,650
<i>And so, as we have seen 
with the equations in the course,</i>

51
00:03:00,650 --> 00:03:05,159
<i>having this magnetic field rotate 
at Larmor frequency</i>

52
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,508
<i>will induce the change in the orientation 
of the magnetization vector,</i>

53
00:03:09,508 --> 00:03:11,868
<i>and that's what we should be seeing here.</i>

54
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:14,768
<i>So, I will bring it into rotation</i>

55
00:03:14,768 --> 00:03:17,498
<i>and then, as I turn it around, 
you can see how it goes down</i>

56
00:03:17,498 --> 00:03:19,588
<i>and then tips at the end.</i>

57
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:23,712
<i>So, this is the same rotation motion,</i>

58
00:03:23,712 --> 00:03:27,555
<i>if I take--this is my </i>B_1<i> field here,</i>

59
00:03:27,555 --> 00:03:28,770
<i>magnetic field, this way,</i>

60
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,990
<i>I take this out 
and just give it a spin here</i>

61
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,900
<i>for the ball without this B_1 field,</i>

62
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:38,278
<i>then it will precess 
in the external magnetic field,</i>

63
00:03:38,278 --> 00:03:39,998
<i>like we have seen last week.</i>

64
00:03:42,626 --> 00:03:45,234
OK, so, we have seen,

65
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:47,604
we can visualize that, 
if things are going slow.

66
00:03:47,604 --> 00:03:51,164
Now in reality, things move around 
at the Larmor frequency

67
00:03:51,164 --> 00:03:53,114
in 100 megahertz range

68
00:03:53,114 --> 00:03:56,301
and rotate into the transverse plane 
in the kilohertz range.

69
00:03:56,301 --> 00:03:59,931
So, putting ourselves 
into the rotating frame of reference,

70
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:03,421
where we no longer 
consider the motion due to the <i>B_0</i>,

71
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:07,421
so this term is canceled by the <i>ω_RF / γ</i> .

72
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,970
Τhen in rotating reference frame

73
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:12,900
we have this equation 
of motion to consider.

74
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,550
So, in this rotating reference frame,

75
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,498
which rotates exactly 
at the Larmor frequency,

76
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:21,030
we have a <i>B_1</i>, that is stationary,

77
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,325
we will look now here 
at the <i>z</i>-magnetization,

78
00:04:23,325 --> 00:04:26,075
and we will look 
at the transverse magnetization.

79
00:04:27,565 --> 00:04:32,275
And the <i>B_1</i> field now will rotate 
the magnetization towards the x-y plane.

80
00:04:33,965 --> 00:04:36,905
The way this works is, 
the <i>x</i>-component increases,

81
00:04:36,905 --> 00:04:39,425
the <i>z</i>-component decreases,
this is a simple--

82
00:04:39,425 --> 00:04:41,705
in this reference frame 
is a simple rotation

83
00:04:41,705 --> 00:04:45,155
because in this reference frame 
the <i>B_1</i> is stationary.

84
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,454
The amplitude of <i>B_1</i> determines

85
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:52,324
how fast we get 
towards the transverse plane,

86
00:04:52,324 --> 00:04:55,064
that is, how fast it is rotated,

87
00:04:55,064 --> 00:04:59,544
and we can calculate the flip angle,
if we know the gyromagnetic ratio, the <i>B_1</i>

88
00:04:59,544 --> 00:05:02,624
and the duration 
of the application of this <i>B_1</i>,

89
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:05,524
which is also called the RF pulse.

90
00:05:05,524 --> 00:05:07,584
So, that's the flip angle given.

91
00:05:08,949 --> 00:05:12,939
After the application of this RF field

92
00:05:12,939 --> 00:05:16,698
the <i>z</i>-magnetization 
equals to <i>M_0 cos α</i> --

93
00:05:16,698 --> 00:05:19,528
we have rotated by angle <i>α</i>,

94
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:22,717
and the transverse magnetization 
increases with <i>sin α</i> --

95
00:05:22,717 --> 00:05:25,707
so it's given by <i>M_0 sin α</i>.

96
00:05:25,707 --> 00:05:29,392
This is when we start out
with the equilibrium magnetization.

97
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:33,525
To give us an idea in MRI 
what is the <i>γ B_1</i>,

98
00:05:33,525 --> 00:05:37,225
so we'll look here at frequency,
so <i>γ B_1 / (2 π)</i>

99
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:41,225
is typically from anywhere 
from 0.1 to 1 kilohertz.

100
00:05:41,225 --> 00:05:43,851
This means that the duration 
of this RF pulse,

101
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:45,521
where the RF is turned on,

102
00:05:45,521 --> 00:05:47,801
is typically on the order of milliseconds.

103
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:52,521
For all practical purposes,
this is all that we need to know here.

104
00:05:54,698 --> 00:05:58,179
So now, we have talked 
about nuclear magnetic resonance.

105
00:05:58,179 --> 00:06:01,549
So, we have had the term <i>nuclear</i>--
we had a nucleus involved,

106
00:06:01,549 --> 00:06:05,379
we have a magnetic field, 
so we have the magnetic in there,

107
00:06:05,379 --> 00:06:08,749
but we haven't really talked 
about what "resonance" means.

108
00:06:10,032 --> 00:06:12,532
Let's look at the excitation 
with the <i>B_1</i> field,

109
00:06:12,532 --> 00:06:15,243
and the question we are asking here is

110
00:06:15,243 --> 00:06:17,832
how does applying such an RF pulse,

111
00:06:17,832 --> 00:06:21,222
so an RF field <i>B_1</i> that we apply 
for a certain time <i>τ</i>,

112
00:06:22,772 --> 00:06:26,772
how much can we get excitation, 
that is, up to what range,

113
00:06:26,772 --> 00:06:29,032
how close do we need to be 
to the Larmor frequency

114
00:06:29,032 --> 00:06:30,738
so that we can generate an excitation

115
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:33,300
that is a rotation
into the transverse plane?

116
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:38,813
So, now, if we are 
in our radio frequency field

117
00:06:38,813 --> 00:06:40,853
or rotating frame,

118
00:06:41,893 --> 00:06:45,673
frequency <i>ω_RF</i>,
which we will choose always

119
00:06:45,673 --> 00:06:47,750
such that the <i>B_1</i> becomes stationary.

120
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:49,941
This is the simplest way to describe it,

121
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:55,101
and here <i>ω</i>, the angular frequency 
of the rotating frame,

122
00:06:55,101 --> 00:06:59,901
becomes the angular frequency 
of the radio frequency,

123
00:06:59,901 --> 00:07:02,041
so <i>ω_RF</i>.

124
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,300
So we are now away 
from the Larmor frequency,

125
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:09,070
so we have a <i>Δ ω</i> that's non-zero.

126
00:07:09,522 --> 00:07:15,692
And in this case our magnetization 
will experience an effective field

127
00:07:15,692 --> 00:07:18,876
that is given by <i>γ B_eff</i>,

128
00:07:18,876 --> 00:07:23,056
just given by <i>γ B_1</i> square + (Δ ω) square 
and that the square root.

129
00:07:25,377 --> 00:07:26,597
How does this come about?

130
00:07:26,597 --> 00:07:31,102
Well, we have seen, if we are 
in a rotating reference frame

131
00:07:31,102 --> 00:07:35,143
that does not exactly match 
the Larmor condition,

132
00:07:35,143 --> 00:07:39,550
then we have a residual
<i>z</i> magnetic field, along <i>z</i>,

133
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:41,847
and that's given here by <i>Δ ω</i>.

134
00:07:43,427 --> 00:07:45,917
We are by definition 
in a rotating reference frame,

135
00:07:45,917 --> 00:07:49,077
where <i>γ B_1</i> is stationary, that is--

136
00:07:49,077 --> 00:07:51,207
so <i>γ B_1</i> is stationary,

137
00:07:51,207 --> 00:07:55,874
and our magnetic field 
along <i>z</i> is given by <i>Δ ω</i>,

138
00:07:55,874 --> 00:08:00,854
which is given by <i>γ B_0 - ω_RF</i>.

139
00:08:01,926 --> 00:08:05,413
And so we have a <i>z</i>-component 
of the magnetization;

140
00:08:05,413 --> 00:08:07,383
it's stationary, we have 
a transverse component

141
00:08:07,383 --> 00:08:09,183
of the magnetization 
in our reference frame--

142
00:08:09,183 --> 00:08:10,613
that's stationary as well.

143
00:08:10,619 --> 00:08:12,219
So this is the vector addition,

144
00:08:12,219 --> 00:08:15,529
this gives us an effective 
magnetic field, <i>B_eff</i>

145
00:08:15,529 --> 00:08:17,842
that's tilted by the angle <i>θ</i>.

146
00:08:18,734 --> 00:08:21,884
So, what does it mean now, 
we have the Larmor equation,

147
00:08:21,884 --> 00:08:25,745
and Larmor equation is always true, 
so we have now the rotation axis--

148
00:08:25,745 --> 00:08:29,265
it's dictated by the direction of <i>B_eff</i>--

149
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:34,135
so it is tilted by an angle <i>θ</i>
compared to the transverse plane.

150
00:08:34,135 --> 00:08:36,151
If we were exactly 
on the Larmor frequency,

151
00:08:36,151 --> 00:08:39,911
<i>Δ ω</i> would be zero, <i>θ</i> would be zero,
and we have the case

152
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:42,881
that we have discussed 
last week and just before.

153
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:47,426
So, here is now, what I am going to plot, 
is to illustrate this.

154
00:08:47,426 --> 00:08:51,508
We have the <i>z</i>-axis on the vertical,

155
00:08:51,508 --> 00:08:56,458
we have the equilibrium magnetization
that we started out with,

156
00:08:56,458 --> 00:09:00,241
and this little sphere here indicates
the tip of the magnetization vector.

157
00:09:00,778 --> 00:09:02,858
So, that's the magnetization tip.

158
00:09:03,701 --> 00:09:06,201
It's easier to describe this 
with animation.

159
00:09:06,201 --> 00:09:08,791
Now we'll apply,
in our rotating reference frame,

160
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:11,621
a <i>B_1</i> that is constant.

161
00:09:11,621 --> 00:09:15,402
But we are not exactly 
at the Larmor frequency,

162
00:09:15,402 --> 00:09:21,542
so we have a <i>Δ ω / γ</i>
that's the <i>Δ B</i> that is left.

163
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:24,710
So we have also the <i>z</i>-component.

164
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,926
So, this corresponds to this, 
and this corresponds to this,

165
00:09:27,926 --> 00:09:31,296
so we get a <i>B_eff</i>
that's in this direction.

166
00:09:32,021 --> 00:09:34,294
Now, the Larmor equation says,

167
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:37,644
our magnetization 
which is initially here, it will...

168
00:09:37,644 --> 00:09:40,484
only its component 
perpendicular to <i>B_eff</i> will change,

169
00:09:40,484 --> 00:09:42,314
the one that's parallel will not change,

170
00:09:42,314 --> 00:09:45,997
so we will get a circular motion 
around <i>B_eff</i>,

171
00:09:45,997 --> 00:09:48,917
and here is our circular motion.

172
00:09:50,821 --> 00:09:52,836
So our magnetization vector here

173
00:09:52,836 --> 00:09:56,356
will rotate on a circular motion 
around <i>B_eff</i>.

174
00:09:56,886 --> 00:10:03,116
Now, here the particular choice of <i>Δ B</i>
is such that <i>B_1 = Δ ω / γ</i>,

175
00:10:03,116 --> 00:10:05,331
so we have a 45-degree angle,

176
00:10:05,331 --> 00:10:06,991
and in this case, we are still able

177
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:09,211
to get the magnetization 
from being along <i>z</i>

178
00:10:09,211 --> 00:10:10,921
to being in the transverse plane.

179
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:15,918
Βut remember, when we had 
the <i>B_1</i> only here,

180
00:10:15,918 --> 00:10:19,908
we were on resonance, this term is zero, 
so the <i>B_eff</i> is along <i>B_1</i>,

181
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:25,794
then we can easily rotate it also
into the <i>- z-orientation</i>,

182
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:30,723
the magnetization here, 
with this particular condition

183
00:10:30,723 --> 00:10:33,286
we are no longer able to do that.

184
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:35,940
Now, let's take the same situation.

185
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:38,730
We'll start out with the magnetization--
it shall be the same.

186
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:41,200
Here is the magnetization vector tip.

187
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:45,470
I'll apply the same <i>B_1</i>--
this shall be the same <i>B_1</i> as here.

188
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:50,622
But now, let's say, 
we are applying this <i>B_1</i> field

189
00:10:50,622 --> 00:10:52,602
further away from the Larmor condition,

190
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:55,269
so we are further away 
from the precession frequency

191
00:10:55,269 --> 00:10:59,149
of the magnetization 
in the absence of a <i>B_1</i> field.

192
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:02,036
So, now our <i>B_eff</i> is given again by <i>B_1</i>,

193
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:06,106
and the <i>z</i>-component--
that's the mismatch between the frequency

194
00:11:06,106 --> 00:11:09,456
at which <i>B_1</i> rotates 
and the Larmor frequency.

195
00:11:09,456 --> 00:11:12,716
And now we have the motion, 
again, by the Larmor equation

196
00:11:12,716 --> 00:11:17,340
given by precession around <i>B_eff</i>,
and now it precesses

197
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:22,370
on this conical motion 
on this circular motion around <i>B_eff</i>.

198
00:11:22,893 --> 00:11:25,779
Notice here that the magnetization

199
00:11:25,779 --> 00:11:29,179
is now no longer able 
to reach the transverse plane,

200
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:33,949
so we are no longer able 
to excite the magnetization fully.

201
00:11:34,549 --> 00:11:35,987
I'll take a third example,

202
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,475
we will start out again 
with the same magnetization.

203
00:11:38,475 --> 00:11:42,215
Here is the vector tip,
the tip of the magnetization vector.

204
00:11:42,215 --> 00:11:45,994
We will use the same <i>γ B_1</i>,
so the same <i>B_1</i>,

205
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:49,681
and now we are even further away 
from the Larmor condition

206
00:11:49,681 --> 00:11:53,991
with the frequency of our <i>B_1</i>.
So we are rotating--

207
00:11:53,991 --> 00:11:56,132
The <i>B_1</i> is now applied at a frequency

208
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,572
that's far away from the Larmor frequency.

209
00:11:58,572 --> 00:12:03,882
Our rotating frame 
is far away from the <i>γ B_0</i>.

210
00:12:04,363 --> 00:12:09,063
In this case, we have 
a residual <i>z</i>-component, <i>Δ B</i>,

211
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:12,063
which is <i>Δ ω / γ</i>,

212
00:12:12,063 --> 00:12:19,095
so that's <i>B_0 - ω_RF / γ</i>

213
00:12:20,635 --> 00:12:22,472
and the <i>B_1</i> has stayed constant,

214
00:12:22,472 --> 00:12:27,932
so our <i>B_eff</i> is now tilted more 
towards the vertical axis,

215
00:12:27,932 --> 00:12:31,376
the motion is again 
by the Larmor equation

216
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:34,666
given by this circular motion 
perpendicular to <i>B_eff</i>.

217
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:37,470
Now, you can imagine,

218
00:12:37,470 --> 00:12:41,260
as you go further and further away 
from the Larmor condition,

219
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,300
the <i>z</i>-component 
of the effective field will increase,

220
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:47,080
the frequency 
by which the magnetization precesses

221
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:50,690
progressively increases,
while the flip angle, maximum flip angle

222
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:53,040
which is this point here 
that we can obtain

223
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:54,570
decreases and decreases,

224
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:58,380
and at some point we won't be able 
to produce any motion

225
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,513
of the magnetization that is discernible,
and nothing happens.

226
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:08,480
So, clearly if the RF, 
the frequency of the RF field

227
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,883
is too far away from the Larmor condition,

228
00:13:10,883 --> 00:13:13,696
we are no longer able 
to produce excitation

229
00:13:13,696 --> 00:13:17,136
and have the magnetization 
in the transverse plane.

230
00:13:17,996 --> 00:13:22,546
So, this condition here, 
where we have considerable alignment

231
00:13:22,546 --> 00:13:24,426
of the effective field with <i>z</i>,

232
00:13:24,426 --> 00:13:27,774
where essentially 
nothing interesting happens,

233
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:31,895
is called the "off resonance", 
the <i>B_1</i> is much smaller than the <i>Δ B</i>,

234
00:13:31,895 --> 00:13:35,205
and essentially the effective field 
is more or less parallel to <i>z</i>.

235
00:13:36,635 --> 00:13:40,455
Whereas, if we have "on resonance",
then "on resonance",

236
00:13:40,455 --> 00:13:44,385
it suffices to say
that the <i>γ B_1</i>, so this vector,

237
00:13:44,385 --> 00:13:48,144
is much larger than the <i>Δ ω</i>--
that's this component here.

238
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:52,364
And in this case essentially 
the effective field is parallel to <i>B_1</i>,

239
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:56,880
and we have the situation 
of the stationary <i>B_1</i> field,

240
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,330
"on resonance".

241
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:02,200
So this is the situation 
of "on resonance".

242
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:05,120
We are close to the Larmor frequency, 
and "close" here means

243
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:09,580
that <i>γ B_1</i> has to be big 
compared to the mismatch

244
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:11,830
between a radio frequency 
pulse frequency

245
00:14:11,830 --> 00:14:13,830
and the Larmor frequency.

246
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:18,140
This is a reason why one in MRI 
applies radio frequency pulses

247
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,460
for short duration of periods;

248
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,190
one wants to have 
a sufficiently large <i>γ B_1</i>

249
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:26,920
and, as an idea here, the RF field--
the <i>B_1</i> field,

250
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:32,618
is typically applied for periods 
of around one millisecond.

251
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:39,251
As a rule of thumb, the RF field 
with an amplitude of <i>B_1</i>

252
00:14:39,251 --> 00:14:44,501
can excite a range of frequencies 
on the order of <i>+ - γ B_1</i> .

253
00:14:45,356 --> 00:14:48,406
We can see here, here it is, <i>γ B_1</i>

254
00:14:49,646 --> 00:14:53,856
the <i>Δ ω</i> is <i>γ B_1</i> here,

255
00:14:55,734 --> 00:14:58,824
and here we still can excite, 
so in this case that's the plus and minus,

256
00:14:58,824 --> 00:15:01,164
because we can do this 
also on the other side.

257
00:15:02,197 --> 00:15:05,015
Now, there is 
a quantum mechanical equivalent--

258
00:15:05,015 --> 00:15:08,165
we remind ourselves, 
we're talking quantum mechanics here,

259
00:15:08,165 --> 00:15:10,535
and this basically means we have--

260
00:15:10,535 --> 00:15:13,145
as we change the orientation
of the magnetization,

261
00:15:13,145 --> 00:15:16,995
we also change the population 
in the energy levels,

262
00:15:16,995 --> 00:15:20,339
and the transition probability 
is highest if the photons--

263
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:21,989
we speak of photons here--

264
00:15:21,989 --> 00:15:25,906
the energy of the photons matches

265
00:15:25,906 --> 00:15:30,866
the difference of the energy levels 
in our nucleus.

266
00:15:30,866 --> 00:15:32,966
That's how we can induce transitions

267
00:15:32,966 --> 00:15:37,496
in the population of the energy levels.

268
00:15:37,496 --> 00:15:41,286
And this is illustrated here

269
00:15:41,286 --> 00:15:43,776
with people jumping on the bridge.

270
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,086
If you do this with the correct frequency,

271
00:15:46,086 --> 00:15:48,936
then you get the maximum
amplitude, classically.

272
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:51,946
That is what we've seen 
with resonance when we discuss,

273
00:15:51,946 --> 00:15:54,991
in classical mechanics,
the harmonic oscillator.

274
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:57,930
And on the right you'll see the picture 
of the Tacoma Bay Bridge--

275
00:15:57,930 --> 00:16:04,064
famous example of illustrating resonance

276
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:08,444
that's used in the classroom context.
