1
00:00:04,318 --> 00:00:08,502
So now I want to review
the rotating frame description

2
00:00:08,502 --> 00:00:12,851
of the magnetization 
because this is really important

3
00:00:12,851 --> 00:00:15,830
that we have a good grasp
of this description.

4
00:00:17,021 --> 00:00:20,154
So, the equation of motion
for the magnetization

5
00:00:20,154 --> 00:00:24,192
has to be valid in any reference frame
in the presence of a magnetic field

6
00:00:24,192 --> 00:00:25,785
is given by the Larmor equation

7
00:00:25,785 --> 00:00:29,114
which states that
the magnetization precesses

8
00:00:29,114 --> 00:00:31,559
around <i>delta B</i> effective

9
00:00:31,559 --> 00:00:34,843
with the frequency
<i>gamma delta B</i> effective.

10
00:00:35,478 --> 00:00:38,043
If the <i>B</i> effective is 
along <i>z</i>, then this means

11
00:00:38,043 --> 00:00:41,791
that the magnetization will precess
in the <i>xy</i> plane with a frequency

12
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:46,000
that's given
by <i>gamma delta B</i> effective over <i>2 pi</i>.

13
00:00:47,038 --> 00:00:50,764
Now, let's re-look 
at the rotating reference frame.

14
00:00:50,764 --> 00:00:54,403
So we have a reference frame
that rotates around <i>z</i>, about<i> z,</i>

15
00:00:54,403 --> 00:00:57,220
with a frame frequency <i>omega RF.</i>

16
00:00:58,608 --> 00:01:00,891
Let's take the first case: 
The rotating reference frame

17
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:03,635
does not rotate.
That's the lab frame; that's what--

18
00:01:03,635 --> 00:01:07,151
our reference frame.
So, <i>omega RF</i> is zero.

19
00:01:08,523 --> 00:01:12,509
In this case, the magnetization precesses
in the <i>xy</i> plane with a frequency

20
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:15,089
<i>gamma B 0</i> over <i>2 pi.</i>

21
00:01:17,016 --> 00:01:22,240
So, if you take the reference frame here,
we have the <i>B-zero</i> here;

22
00:01:22,914 --> 00:01:24,931
we have our magnetization here.

23
00:01:25,484 --> 00:01:28,362
We're just putting the magnetization
at a certain angle,

24
00:01:28,362 --> 00:01:31,452
so we're just looking 
at the component that's transverse.

25
00:01:34,581 --> 00:01:36,448
That's effect -- this component here,

26
00:01:36,448 --> 00:01:40,760
the component that's perpendicular
to <i>B-zero</i> does not precess.

27
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:45,160
So this magnetization here,
the transverse magnetization will precess

28
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:48,887
with a angular velocity <i>omega-l.</i>

29
00:01:48,887 --> 00:01:53,072
So it will -- this angle will increase
with <i>omega-l-t,</i>

30
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:55,614
it goes around <i>B-zero,</i>

31
00:01:55,614 --> 00:01:58,879
encircles the transverse component.

32
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:01,086
So if we take the transverse component,

33
00:02:01,086 --> 00:02:03,839
then the transverse component
will simply do this motion.

34
00:02:03,839 --> 00:02:09,114
That's the Larmor equation
in the non-rotating reference frame.

35
00:02:09,763 --> 00:02:14,014
Now we'll take the second case,
and that is the rotating reference frame.

36
00:02:14,014 --> 00:02:17,037
And now we'll place ourselves 
into the rotating reference frame

37
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:20,071
that rotates exactly 
with the Larmor frequency.

38
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:22,749
In this rotating frame,

39
00:02:22,749 --> 00:02:26,464
as we are rotating exactly
with the magnetization,

40
00:02:26,464 --> 00:02:29,982
this magnetization is,
by definition, stationary.

41
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:32,494
It does not move, or in other words,

42
00:02:32,494 --> 00:02:36,035
it precesses in <i>xy</i> with zero frequency.

43
00:02:38,273 --> 00:02:40,981
Now, the equation of motion 
that we have up here

44
00:02:40,981 --> 00:02:43,662
still has to be valid 
in this reference frame.

45
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:47,267
So, the precession frequency is equal

46
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,718
to <i>gamma</i>-<i>delta-B</i> effective over <i>2-pi</i>,

47
00:02:50,718 --> 00:02:51,975
or in this case,

48
00:02:51,975 --> 00:02:54,752
the <i>delta-B</i>-effective will be zero.

49
00:02:56,776 --> 00:02:59,588
And our magnetization will do this motion,

50
00:02:59,588 --> 00:03:00,853
namely, none,

51
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:05,312
because we are in the reference frame
where it doesn't move.

52
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,287
Now, the Larmor frequency in [inaudible],

53
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:15,081
in the rotating reference frame is given
by <i>gamma</i>-<i>delta-B</i>-effective,

54
00:03:15,081 --> 00:03:18,099
and this <i>gamma-delta-B</i> --
this <i>delta-B</i>-effective

55
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:22,337
is given by <i>B-zero</i>
minus <i>omega-R-F</i> over <i>gamma</i>.

56
00:03:23,546 --> 00:03:28,532
So what this means 
is we are to get from here

57
00:03:28,532 --> 00:03:30,704
to the lab frame,
to the rotating reference frame

58
00:03:30,704 --> 00:03:34,368
that rotates with a Larmor frequency,
what we have had to do

59
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:36,750
to still have the equation work,
we have to subtract

60
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:40,385
a fictitious magnetic field
which in this case equals

61
00:03:40,385 --> 00:03:44,143
to <i>omega-L</i> over <i>gamma</i>
and <i>omega-L</i> is <i>gamma-B-zero</i>,

62
00:03:44,143 --> 00:03:48,660
so the <i>delta-B</i>-effective 
was <i>B-zero</i> minus <i>B-zero</i> equals <i>zero</i>.

63
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:52,111
But this holds true for any <i>omega-R-F </i>
for any angular velocity

64
00:03:52,111 --> 00:03:53,912
of a rotating reference frame,

65
00:03:53,912 --> 00:03:57,175
and we can calculate a <i>delta-B</i>-effective.

66
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:03,165
Now here, I want to make 
a short digression into quantum mechanics.

67
00:04:03,165 --> 00:04:07,534
Not what we strictly need
quantum mechanics for understanding

68
00:04:07,534 --> 00:04:09,513
most of the MRI principles.

69
00:04:09,513 --> 00:04:12,707
We can actually work very much 
with a classical principle.

70
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:16,983
But we want to remind ourselves
that magnetic resonance

71
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:21,094
is a quantum mechanical manifestation.

72
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,157
It is a property, comes 
out of quantum mechanics.

73
00:04:24,157 --> 00:04:27,875
Quantum mechanics is the proper way
of describing things,

74
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:32,285
and what I want to do here 
is build a bridge between

75
00:04:34,185 --> 00:04:36,501
our description, classical description,

76
00:04:36,501 --> 00:04:40,354
and the quantum mechanical theory
that's behind this.

77
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:44,072
So let's look at 
the Schrödinger representation.

78
00:04:44,072 --> 00:04:47,682
We have the derivative of the cat
is equals to the Hamiltonians

79
00:04:47,682 --> 00:04:49,415
times the cat,

80
00:04:49,415 --> 00:04:53,127
and if the Hamiltonian is constant
in time, then we can write the solution

81
00:04:53,127 --> 00:04:54,577
very simply.

82
00:04:55,088 --> 00:04:57,794
The expectation value 
of a operator<i> I-z</i>

83
00:04:57,794 --> 00:05:02,632
is given by this term here
in the Schrödinger representation.

84
00:05:02,632 --> 00:05:06,926
So this is all standard theory
from quantum mechanics.

85
00:05:07,372 --> 00:05:11,790
Now, we have some equivalencies here,
and that is the magnetization

86
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,269
along <i>z</i> is the expectation value
of the operator <i>I-z,</i>

87
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:20,192
magnetization along <i>x</i>, that of <i>i-x</i>,
and the magnetization along <i>y</i>,

88
00:05:20,192 --> 00:05:22,669
the expectation value of <i>I-y.</i>

89
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:25,723
So in other words, 
our macroscopic quantities

90
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:29,196
that we observe the magnetization
are the expectation values

91
00:05:29,196 --> 00:05:33,987
of the quantum mechanical
operators associated.

92
00:05:36,088 --> 00:05:37,898
So, this is very nice.

93
00:05:37,898 --> 00:05:41,338
So, for a spin one-half 
that's a hydrogen nucleus

94
00:05:41,338 --> 00:05:43,909
at the proton,
we have two energy levels,

95
00:05:43,909 --> 00:05:46,203
so we have -- this is the operator

96
00:05:46,203 --> 00:05:49,210
for <i>I-z, I-x,</i> and <i>I-y.</i>

97
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:53,827
These are the Pauli spin matrices
that describe the system.

98
00:05:55,275 --> 00:05:59,248
Now, how do we determine 
the time dependence of <i>I-x,</i>

99
00:05:59,248 --> 00:06:02,269
that is of the <i>m-x</i> magnetization?

100
00:06:02,746 --> 00:06:05,586
And the way this is done here 
is we split the Hamiltonian

101
00:06:05,586 --> 00:06:08,600
into time-invariant 
and time-dependent terms.

102
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:13,418
So we can write
our Schrödinger equation here.

103
00:06:13,418 --> 00:06:16,019
We'll split the Hamiltonian,
this term here,

104
00:06:16,019 --> 00:06:20,121
into time-invariant term here
and a time-dependent term.

105
00:06:20,903 --> 00:06:23,737
And then we impose 
that the time-invariant term

106
00:06:23,737 --> 00:06:25,231
is much bigger.

107
00:06:25,231 --> 00:06:29,828
Its eigenvalues are much bigger
than those of the time-dependent term

108
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:32,423
and we'll use here now
the interaction representation,

109
00:06:32,423 --> 00:06:35,322
which comes from
higher order perturbation theory.

110
00:06:35,975 --> 00:06:37,433
And if we do that,

111
00:06:38,901 --> 00:06:41,821
the transformation that is being done
that comes out of this theory

112
00:06:41,821 --> 00:06:46,045
is that we have now the cat
in the interaction representation

113
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:51,850
and we will now enter this condition
the representation equation of motion

114
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:56,411
for the wave function 
becomes this term here.

115
00:06:56,411 --> 00:07:01,369
And we have now the <i>V</i> of <i>t</i>
is transferred to the<i> V</i>

116
00:07:01,369 --> 00:07:05,805
in the interaction representation.
This is the transformation given here.

117
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:10,047
Now for spin, for a nuclear spin,
this is all general theory,

118
00:07:10,047 --> 00:07:13,979
now, for a nuclear spin,
the static Hamiltonian

119
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,030
is the one associated
to the magnetic field.

120
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,671
That's the one that generates
the two energy levels.

121
00:07:18,671 --> 00:07:21,679
Hence, we have <i>I-z</i> here as the operator,

122
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:27,463
and we can take 
the time-variant Hamiltonian

123
00:07:27,463 --> 00:07:29,591
given by this term here.

124
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:32,091
Now what is this --

125
00:07:33,448 --> 00:07:36,882
How does this transform if you do
this transformation here

126
00:07:36,882 --> 00:07:39,831
if we use an <i>omega-R-F</i> here
in this term here

127
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:42,195
that is equal to <i>gamma-B-zero?</i>

128
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:44,017
And actually, if we do this transformation

129
00:07:44,017 --> 00:07:47,022
we'll find that
in the interaction representation,

130
00:07:47,022 --> 00:07:50,287
this time-variant term here,
which we have in this term here,

131
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:53,136
becomes time-independent.

132
00:07:54,352 --> 00:07:57,356
So, the beauty here is

133
00:07:57,356 --> 00:08:02,226
that we have used classically
the description

134
00:08:02,226 --> 00:08:05,986
in the rotating reference frame
to make things stationary.

135
00:08:05,986 --> 00:08:08,392
If we do this 
in the interaction representation,

136
00:08:08,392 --> 00:08:12,668
and we make our Hamiltonian 
in this representation stationary,

137
00:08:12,668 --> 00:08:16,245
we're essentially doing the same thing
but in quantum mechanics,

138
00:08:16,245 --> 00:08:21,761
and we obtain our stationary Hamiltonian,
this is equivalent to putting ourselves

139
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:24,948
into the rotating reference frame.

140
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:28,680
So we have an additional 
quantum mechanical equivalent

141
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:33,468
that is the <i>B-zero</i> is along <i>I-z</i>
is proportional to the operator<i> I-z</i>

142
00:08:33,468 --> 00:08:37,539
at the <i>B-one</i>, and <i>x</i> or <i>y </i>

143
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:40,539
is given by the operator <i>I-x-I-y.</i>

144
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:41,867
That's what this term here is.

145
00:08:41,867 --> 00:08:44,720
This is the description of the <i>R-F </i>field.

146
00:08:46,533 --> 00:08:49,365
So, this is a short digression
into quantum mechanics

147
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:53,178
to remind ourselves 
that what is behind magnetic resonance

148
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:56,312
is truly a quantum mechanical event.
