1
00:00:04,091 --> 00:00:10,092
So now we will look at a description
of the changes in magnetization.

2
00:00:10,092 --> 00:00:13,413
And this will bring us 
to a full description of the changes

3
00:00:13,413 --> 00:00:18,132
in the longitudinal 
and transverse components.

4
00:00:18,132 --> 00:00:21,231
What we have to do, we've already seen 
in the previous lectures--

5
00:00:21,231 --> 00:00:24,954
in the previous weeks--
we have seen the Larmor equation,

6
00:00:24,954 --> 00:00:27,291
which describes 
the precession of magnetization

7
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:29,454
around either a static magnetic field

8
00:00:29,454 --> 00:00:32,653
or a rotating magnetic field like the <i>B_1.</i>

9
00:00:32,653 --> 00:00:35,632
Now what we have to do here
is we just have to add the terms

10
00:00:35,632 --> 00:00:38,815
in the differential equations 
for relaxation--

11
00:00:38,815 --> 00:00:41,295
that is <i>T1</i> and <i>T2.</i>

12
00:00:42,055 --> 00:00:46,353
So for the <i>z</i> magnetization
we will have this term

13
00:00:47,783 --> 00:00:49,493
that's <i>along z.</i>

14
00:00:49,933 --> 00:00:52,785
For the <i>x</i> magnetization we have this term.

15
00:00:53,225 --> 00:00:56,217
And for the <i>y</i> magnetization 
we have this term.

16
00:00:56,887 --> 00:01:00,390
Now this is a fairly complicated 
set of equations here.

17
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,997
As you can see, there are couple 
of differential equations

18
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:07,897
but if we look at this as a whole--
this expression here--

19
00:01:07,897 --> 00:01:11,267
this is nothing but the vector product
of <i>gamma B</i> with <i>M.</i>

20
00:01:11,267 --> 00:01:16,187
So this describes the precession
of the magnetization

21
00:01:16,187 --> 00:01:22,550
around the magnetic field <i>B,</i>
and here <i>B</i> is a general vector.

22
00:01:24,073 --> 00:01:29,080
Now we have the relaxation <i>along z</i>

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,870
that we have introduced this week.

24
00:01:31,870 --> 00:01:35,432
So we have the change 
in magnetization <i>along z,</i>

25
00:01:35,432 --> 00:01:38,800
change in magnetization <i>along x</i> and <i>y.</i>

26
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,533
So these are the relaxation terms.

27
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:44,203
And this gives us the full set 
of differential equations--

28
00:01:44,203 --> 00:01:45,538
the behavior--

29
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:49,142
so we have, on one hand, 
we have precession around <i>B--</i>

30
00:01:49,142 --> 00:01:54,309
that's these terms here--
and we have relaxation now incorporated.

31
00:01:54,919 --> 00:01:58,541
And these three equations here
are the Bloch equations.

32
00:01:58,541 --> 00:02:02,022
They're named after a Swiss physicist,
Felix Bloch,

33
00:02:02,022 --> 00:02:04,303
who was awarded the Nobel Prize

34
00:02:04,303 --> 00:02:07,341
for his discovery of the nuclear 
magnetic resonance effect.

35
00:02:07,341 --> 00:02:10,887
He was awarded 
Nobel Prize in Physics in 1952.

36
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:16,772
If we substitute the term 
for the rotating reference frame,

37
00:02:18,152 --> 00:02:20,555
so we'll substitute the <i>big omega,</i>

38
00:02:20,555 --> 00:02:24,455
which is given by minus <i>gamma B_0</i>
plus <i>omega RF,</i>

39
00:02:24,455 --> 00:02:29,436
then we obtain 
these equations for the term

40
00:02:29,436 --> 00:02:34,759
that's substituting 
these three equations with this term

41
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:38,429
and this is the rotating reference frame,
or in other words,

42
00:02:38,429 --> 00:02:42,370
it's <i>gamma B_1</i> plus <i>omega</i>
in the rotating reference frame

43
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,471
that rotates with the <i>B_1</i> cross <i>M.</i>

44
00:02:46,471 --> 00:02:51,460
So that would be in the description 
in the rotating reference frame.

45
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:56,710
Now what characterizes 
the basic MR signal?

46
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,429
We'll start out with 
the transverse magnetization

47
00:03:00,429 --> 00:03:04,069
and here I'll describe it 
as a complex function.

48
00:03:04,069 --> 00:03:09,940
So the transverse magnetization 
in complex terms

49
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:13,110
is given by the transverse 
magnetization times zero,

50
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,960
times <i>e</i> to the minus <i>i-omega-t</i>,
times <i>e</i> to the minus <i>t/T2.</i>

51
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,782
This is relaxation, this is precession.

52
00:03:21,562 --> 00:03:23,450
Here we're using the complex notation--

53
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,556
we're using the real part, for example, 
to represent the <i>x</i> axis

54
00:03:27,556 --> 00:03:31,134
and the imaginary part 
to represent the <i>y</i> axis.

55
00:03:31,894 --> 00:03:33,383
And what does this signal look like?

56
00:03:33,383 --> 00:03:36,372
This expression-- 
this is the <i>x</i> component.

57
00:03:36,372 --> 00:03:39,195
The envelope, 
that is the amplitude,

58
00:03:39,195 --> 00:03:43,034
decays with <i>T2,</i>
that means the envelope decays with <i>T2</i>

59
00:03:43,034 --> 00:03:45,882
and we see oscillations here
in the real part,

60
00:03:45,882 --> 00:03:48,825
that's the <i>cosine omega t</i> term.

61
00:03:48,825 --> 00:03:51,887
Likewise, for the <i>y</i> term--

62
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:54,387
that would be the imaginary part 
of this equation--

63
00:03:54,387 --> 00:03:58,716
has a similar function 
except it's <i>sine omega t</i> in this case,

64
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:04,239
but it has also the <i>T2 </i>
as the decaying amplitude--

65
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:05,919
the <i>T2</i> effect.

66
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,408
For longitudinal magnetization,
and here I'll just stick to the case

67
00:04:11,408 --> 00:04:13,716
where we have 
a 90 degree full excitation,

68
00:04:13,716 --> 00:04:17,776
so the magnetization has been flipped
into the transverse plane,

69
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:21,928
then the <i>z</i> magnetization--
the longitudinal magnetization--

70
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:28,020
is equal to <i>M_0</i> times 1 
minus <i>e</i> to the minus <i>t/T1.</i>

71
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:35,000
So in the end, what we have 
is a complex description of the motion.

72
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,109
We have the <i>z</i> component 
which recovers towards <i>M_0.</i>,

73
00:04:39,109 --> 00:04:41,750
we have the <i>x</i> and the <i>y</i> component,

74
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:44,635
which basically together 
means that the transverse component

75
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:49,192
rotates in the transverse plane--
according to the Larmor equation--

76
00:04:49,192 --> 00:04:52,431
and also decays exponentially.

77
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:57,613
So this could be described 
by a behavior like this

78
00:04:57,613 --> 00:05:00,556
and this is fairly complicated.

79
00:05:01,896 --> 00:05:06,360
So if you look at the <i>z</i> magnetization,

80
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,862
it builds up in an exponential function.

81
00:05:08,862 --> 00:05:13,395
So it goes from zero to <i>M_0.</i>

82
00:05:13,395 --> 00:05:18,095
This-- how fast it recovers to <i>M_0</i>
is described by <i>T1.</i>

83
00:05:19,615 --> 00:05:24,973
So we have the equilibrium 
<i>z</i> magnetization like this.

84
00:05:25,446 --> 00:05:28,166
We'll start out essentially 
at zero magnetization

85
00:05:28,166 --> 00:05:30,147
and then what happens with time

86
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:36,164
is that the <i>z</i> magnetization 
recovers with <i>e</i> to the minus <i>t/T1</i>

87
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:37,527
towards <i>M_0,</i>

88
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:41,720
that's what the magnetization vector 
will do over time.

89
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,158
Now if we look at 
the transverse component <i>Mxy--</i>

90
00:05:46,158 --> 00:05:48,059
I'll here not distinguish between <i>x</i> and <i>y,</i>

91
00:05:48,059 --> 00:05:50,988
I'll just take this 
as the transverse component--

92
00:05:50,988 --> 00:05:56,079
then this component decays 
while the <i>z</i> component increases.

93
00:05:57,769 --> 00:05:59,478
Of course, <i>Mxy</i> precesses

94
00:05:59,478 --> 00:06:03,840
depending on the choice 
of our rotating reference frame.

95
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,418
So we have also a condition here

96
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:15,220
that we can never exceed 
the equilibrium magnetization <i>M_0</i>

97
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:20,091
and this is a constraint that if we look 
at the norm of the vector--

98
00:06:20,091 --> 00:06:23,610
the total magnetization vector--
it cannot be bigger than <i>M_0</i>

99
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:30,320
and this typically implies that <i>T2</i>
is not bigger than <i>T1.</i>

100
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:34,853
It is typically much smaller,
but certainly it does not exceed <i>T1.</i>

101
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:40,012
Now, I want to give you an example.

102
00:06:40,012 --> 00:06:43,642
This is a preparatory example 
for what is to come next week,

103
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:49,678
and this is how can 
we be sensitive to <i>T1</i> changes?

104
00:06:50,378 --> 00:06:54,135
Or how can we measure 
<i>T1</i> changes precisely?

105
00:06:54,675 --> 00:06:58,976
And here we'll consider 
a so-called <i>multipulse experiment.</i>

106
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:02,745
So the experiment 
is fairly simple, an RF pulse

107
00:07:02,745 --> 00:07:06,602
that is a <i>B_1</i> field 
is applied every <i>TR</i> seconds.

108
00:07:06,602 --> 00:07:12,436
So here is our scheme, 
we apply this every <i>TR</i> seconds.

109
00:07:12,436 --> 00:07:15,114
So here's the time <i>TR.</i>

110
00:07:15,114 --> 00:07:17,577
Then we have a flip angle <i>alpha</i>
applied here

111
00:07:17,577 --> 00:07:20,077
and we'll set this to 90 degrees.

112
00:07:20,077 --> 00:07:24,028
And what this pulse does, 
it converts the <i>z</i> magnetization

113
00:07:24,028 --> 00:07:30,179
to transverse magnetization
and then the signal is measured.

114
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:35,239
So at the beginning, the signal 
is proportional to the <i>z</i> magnetization

115
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:39,121
and therefore it is sensitive 
to <i>T1</i> effects.

116
00:07:41,071 --> 00:07:44,360
So now we'll take the basic 
differential equation

117
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,551
that describes the behavior 
of the <i>z</i> magnetization.

118
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:52,105
We have the recovery to <i>M_0</i>

119
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:55,412
and we have 
the starting magnetization <i>M_0,</i>

120
00:07:55,412 --> 00:07:59,271
that <i>M</i> of time zero that decays with <i>T1.</i>

121
00:08:00,411 --> 00:08:03,303
At time zero, we can say 
that the magnetization,

122
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:06,732
the <i>z</i> magnetization, 
is <i>M_0 cosine alpha</i>

123
00:08:08,312 --> 00:08:11,015
and then we can write this in this form

124
00:08:11,015 --> 00:08:13,382
that is basically we are using the fact

125
00:08:13,382 --> 00:08:16,623
that we have used a 90 degree pulse here.

126
00:08:16,623 --> 00:08:21,845
So <i>M_0 cosine alpha</i>,
since cosine of 90 degrees is zero,

127
00:08:21,845 --> 00:08:23,715
then we have this term is zero,

128
00:08:23,715 --> 00:08:26,665
so our <i>z</i> magnetization 
is just this term here,

129
00:08:26,665 --> 00:08:29,164
which is written here again.

130
00:08:30,774 --> 00:08:33,767
So, if I express this now as a function 
of the repetition time,

131
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:37,776
so we'll repeat our 90 degree pulse 
every <i>TR</i> seconds,

132
00:08:37,776 --> 00:08:41,751
then our <i>z</i> magnetization 
as a function of <i>TR</i>

133
00:08:41,751 --> 00:08:47,425
is given by the equilibrium magnetization
times 1 minus <i>e</i> to the minus <i>TR/T1.</i>

134
00:08:48,975 --> 00:08:53,845
Now here what is crucial 
is we have an effect of <i>T1</i>

135
00:08:55,005 --> 00:08:58,400
as well as an effect of--
the same holds true for <i>T2</i>

136
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:03,619
but the effect of <i>T1</i> on the signal
depends strongly on how it is measured.

137
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:07,078
So let me give you the example here.

138
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:13,781
If we take a short <i>T1</i> component
and we measure every 500 milliseconds,

139
00:09:13,781 --> 00:09:16,521
we get the signal intensity 
that is like this.

140
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:21,602
If we have a long <i>T1</i> component, 
but we measure with 1.5 seconds <i>TR,</i>

141
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:24,061
we get the same pixel intensity.

142
00:09:24,821 --> 00:09:31,488
So unlike the CT units--
the Hounsfield units in an MRI--

143
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:37,034
we <i>cannot</i> attribute a signal intensity 
in a pixel to a specific value of <i>T1</i>

144
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:39,745
or a specific biophysical mechanism

145
00:09:39,745 --> 00:09:43,863
<i>because</i> we need to know 
how this has been measured.

146
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:48,050
So in this particular example, 
if we had measured at 1.5 seconds,

147
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:49,993
this component 
will give the same intensity

148
00:09:49,993 --> 00:09:54,218
as if we had measured at 500 milliseconds
for a short <i>T1</i> component.

149
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:59,305
So this is essential here 
that the pixel intensity, as such,

150
00:09:59,305 --> 00:10:03,726
doesn't have a direct 
biophysical interpretation.

151
00:10:04,636 --> 00:10:06,821
Now if we are doing 
this multipulse experiment,

152
00:10:06,821 --> 00:10:09,857
so we apply a 90 degree pulse 
every <i>TR</i> second,

153
00:10:09,857 --> 00:10:15,177
at what point would be 
the most sensitive to changes in <i>T1</i>?

154
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:19,349
And for imaging that's important,
that would give us the maximum contrast.

155
00:10:19,349 --> 00:10:25,016
To approach this, we will use 
the error propagation calculation

156
00:10:25,016 --> 00:10:28,997
that I introduced in lesson one 
of part one of this course.

157
00:10:28,997 --> 00:10:31,308
The same procedure here applies.

158
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:36,430
So first we calculate the derivative
of the <i>z</i> magnetization with respect to <i>T1.</i>

159
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:42,021
This just tells us how strong 
does the <i>z</i> magnetization vary

160
00:10:42,021 --> 00:10:44,391
if one were to vary <i>T1.</i>

161
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:46,400
So where is the <i>z</i> magnetization?

162
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,530
How much does it vary 
in response to variations to <i>T1</i>?

163
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:53,990
So that's just the derivative 
of this term with respect to <i>T1</i>

164
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:58,008
and this is the expression that we obtain.

165
00:10:58,008 --> 00:11:00,581
And we'll call this function <i>big F.</i>

166
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:04,107
Of course we know, if we measure with <i>TR</i>
it essentially equals zero.

167
00:11:04,107 --> 00:11:07,972
The magnetization cannot recover
so it will be essentially zero.

168
00:11:07,972 --> 00:11:10,571
So we are not sensitive to changes in <i>T1.</i>

169
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:16,223
And if we write 5 times the biggest <i>T1</i>
that is present in our tissue

170
00:11:16,223 --> 00:11:18,220
then everything has recovered to <i>M_0</i>

171
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:21,903
and we're again, not sensitive 
to changes in <i>T1.</i>

172
00:11:21,903 --> 00:11:26,893
So somewhere between zero and infinity--
for the time <i>T--</i>

173
00:11:26,893 --> 00:11:29,376
we have a maximum of this function.

174
00:11:29,376 --> 00:11:31,455
And to find the maximum 
of this function <i>F,</i>

175
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:37,020
we'll take the derivative of <i>F</i>
with respect to the time <i>T,</i>

176
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:39,406
which is here the <i>TR.</i>

177
00:11:39,406 --> 00:11:42,506
We'll set the <i>F</i> to <i>dt</i> equals zero,
we want to find the maximum,

178
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:45,535
we do the chain rule for derivation,

179
00:11:45,535 --> 00:11:47,828
so that's what we're interested in

180
00:11:47,828 --> 00:11:50,248
and then we obtain this expression here.

181
00:11:50,248 --> 00:11:53,065
If we simplify what we've obtained here,

182
00:11:53,065 --> 00:11:57,088
this is not zero, this is not zero
so only what is in brackets can be zero.

183
00:11:57,088 --> 00:12:00,819
And <i>t</i> equals the <i>optimal TR,</i>

184
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:04,951
if the <i>optimal TR</i> is equal to <i>T1.</i>

185
00:12:05,851 --> 00:12:09,037
So this is a not surprising result,
we have seen similar things.

186
00:12:09,037 --> 00:12:11,087
We're always dealing
with exponential functions

187
00:12:11,087 --> 00:12:14,839
and typically the change 
in the decay constant

188
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:18,370
or, here, the <i>T1</i> is optimally detected

189
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,789
if we measure at an exponential parameter

190
00:12:21,789 --> 00:12:26,193
that corresponds to this decay time, 
or the <i>T1</i> here.

191
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:32,372
So in other words, if we have 
a rough idea what the <i>T1</i> is,

192
00:12:32,372 --> 00:12:36,038
we should be setting 
for a series of 90 degree pulses

193
00:12:36,038 --> 00:12:38,493
that we apply every <i>TR</i> seconds.

194
00:12:38,493 --> 00:12:41,643
We should be setting this <i>TR</i> to roughly <i>T1</i>

195
00:12:41,643 --> 00:12:46,033
to be most sensitive to changes in <i>T1.</i>

196
00:12:47,593 --> 00:12:52,086
And here is a message that is dear to me
that I want to stress.

197
00:12:52,086 --> 00:12:57,593
The intensity in our images--
the MRI images that are being measured--

198
00:12:57,593 --> 00:13:02,769
depend strongly 
on the relaxation, but in a way,

199
00:13:02,769 --> 00:13:07,355
that depends strongly 
on how this signal intensity

200
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:09,475
is being measured.

201
00:13:09,475 --> 00:13:12,146
So let's look at the transverse component.

202
00:13:12,146 --> 00:13:14,839
We have transverse magnetization.

203
00:13:14,839 --> 00:13:16,420
This is cerebrospinal fluid,

204
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:19,065
we have gray matter, white matter and fat.

205
00:13:19,065 --> 00:13:22,101
And we can see for CSF--
cerebrospinal fluid

206
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:26,286
which contains very little cell membranes,
very little proteins--

207
00:13:26,286 --> 00:13:30,617
the <i>T2</i> is very long,
it's about 1.4 seconds in this example.

208
00:13:30,617 --> 00:13:35,355
Gray matter is at 100 milliseconds
and white matter is at 90 milliseconds.

209
00:13:35,355 --> 00:13:36,799
And then we have fat here,

210
00:13:36,799 --> 00:13:43,534
so 37% of the decay signal 
gives us the <i>T2</i> here.

211
00:13:43,534 --> 00:13:46,370
If we look now at the recovery--

212
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:48,450
here's the 90 degree pulse 
and the recovery,

213
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:53,708
then fat goes the fastest,
white matter goes second fastest

214
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,141
then gray matter then CSF.

215
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:59,601
And CSF here in this example 
has a <i>T1</i> of 2.5 seconds.

216
00:13:59,601 --> 00:14:03,980
So what we see here is now typically
we would do a T2-weighted image

217
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:06,113
if we want to see changes in <i>T2.</i>

218
00:14:06,113 --> 00:14:09,323
We would wait a certain time 
after the excitation pulse

219
00:14:09,323 --> 00:14:11,623
and detect the signal.

220
00:14:11,623 --> 00:14:15,193
Now CSF will be the brightest 
because it has the longest <i>T2,</i>

221
00:14:15,193 --> 00:14:18,722
it has very little protein in it
so it has long <i>T2.</i>

222
00:14:18,722 --> 00:14:24,936
Conversely, CSF has long <i>T1</i>
but here we're deducing the waiting

223
00:14:24,936 --> 00:14:27,053
by waiting not the full time,

224
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:31,454
we're waiting a shorter time
than full relaxation.

225
00:14:31,454 --> 00:14:34,359
So actually, the signal 
from the cerebrospinal fluid

226
00:14:34,359 --> 00:14:39,254
will be lower compared to the signal 
from gray matter and white matter.

227
00:14:40,404 --> 00:14:45,592
So even though it has long <i>T1</i>
and a long <i>T2</i> in T1-weighted images

228
00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:46,931
the CSF will be dark

229
00:14:46,931 --> 00:14:49,945
and in T2-weighted images 
it will appear bright

230
00:14:49,945 --> 00:14:52,985
compared to the other tissues.

231
00:14:52,985 --> 00:14:57,266
So let's look at an example here.
We have on the vertical axis

232
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:00,668
we are plotting the time after excitation

233
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:03,887
and the <i>TR</i> on the horizontal axis.

234
00:15:03,887 --> 00:15:08,858
And so we have a very long <i>TR</i> here,
we go from 30 to 160 milliseconds.

235
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:14,459
Look at the eye bulbs 
which are primarily just water,

236
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:19,437
how bright they get 
with a longer time after excitation.

237
00:15:19,437 --> 00:15:22,990
As we start reducing the <i>TR,</i>

238
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:26,122
we're starting to have 
increasing effects of <i>T1</i>

239
00:15:26,122 --> 00:15:29,310
and we're starting also to see
that the images are getting darker.

240
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:33,471
That is a consequence 
of not being over here

241
00:15:33,471 --> 00:15:36,771
but being more and more closer 
to this situation.

242
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:38,944
We're here at 800 milliseconds

243
00:15:38,944 --> 00:15:41,842
and here is 200 milliseconds.

244
00:15:41,842 --> 00:15:45,572
We can clearly see the fat here 
becoming bright at short echo time

245
00:15:45,572 --> 00:15:47,563
and short <i>TR.</i>

246
00:15:47,563 --> 00:15:50,882
The fat is becoming bright, 
the CSF here is dark,

247
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:52,483
the eyes are dark--

248
00:15:52,483 --> 00:15:55,483
that is consistent with these values here.

249
00:15:55,483 --> 00:15:59,358
And what is also important here 
is a good choice of parameters

250
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:05,407
allows to depict 
certain pathological conditions.

251
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:10,695
A bad choice of parameters is detrimental
to detection of any signal.

252
00:16:10,695 --> 00:16:14,804
So if one is to choose a long echo <i>T--</i>
time after excitation--

253
00:16:14,804 --> 00:16:19,058
and a long <i>TR,</i>
then we are basically seeing no signal

254
00:16:19,058 --> 00:16:21,021
and that is not a good choice.

255
00:16:21,021 --> 00:16:25,334
So in order to interpret MRI signals,
one <i>has</i> to know

256
00:16:25,334 --> 00:16:27,616
the experimental conditions 
that are being done

257
00:16:27,616 --> 00:16:33,568
and this is one of the reasons 
why MRI is such a complex technique

258
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:37,527
to use in clinical practice
but it is also an advantage

259
00:16:37,527 --> 00:16:40,098
because we have a lot of mechanisms

260
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:44,110
and means to manipulate image contrast.

261
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,824
Now I want to conclude this week's lecture

262
00:16:48,824 --> 00:16:51,521
with a summary on magnetic resonance.

263
00:16:51,521 --> 00:16:54,531
What do we know so far?

264
00:16:54,531 --> 00:17:00,209
So we have established last week

265
00:17:00,209 --> 00:17:03,259
that we need a magnetic field <i>B_0.</i>

266
00:17:03,929 --> 00:17:08,200
This establishes 
an equilibrium magnetization <i>M_0</i>

267
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:12,913
that is parallel to the <i>z</i> axis.

268
00:17:12,913 --> 00:17:15,382
And this equilibrium magnetization

269
00:17:15,382 --> 00:17:18,182
increases with the number 
of spins in the voxel,

270
00:17:18,182 --> 00:17:20,952
it increases 
with the static magnetic field <i>B_0</i>

271
00:17:20,952 --> 00:17:26,073
and it increases 
with the gyromagnetic ratio <i>gamma.</i>

272
00:17:26,073 --> 00:17:27,582
So that's one thing that we need.

273
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:31,854
We need to be in a strong magnetic field

274
00:17:31,854 --> 00:17:34,644
to have an equilibrium magnetization.

275
00:17:35,234 --> 00:17:38,337
Then we need a RF field--<i>B_1--</i>

276
00:17:38,337 --> 00:17:41,829
which is typically applied 
on the resonance

277
00:17:41,829 --> 00:17:45,574
that is close to 
that Larmor frequency, <i>omega L.</i>

278
00:17:46,914 --> 00:17:51,575
And this <i>B_1</i> field allows us 
to tilt the magnetization

279
00:17:51,575 --> 00:17:55,205
into the transverse plane,
so we're tilting the <i>z</i> magnetization

280
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:56,646
into the transverse plane.

281
00:17:56,646 --> 00:18:00,308
Here the plane is in <i>xy.</i>

282
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:04,455
The signal detection process 
of magnetic resonance imaging

283
00:18:04,455 --> 00:18:06,058
is done by precession.

284
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:09,299
We're looking at the transverse component
of the magnetization

285
00:18:09,299 --> 00:18:12,900
that precesses 
around the magnetic field <i>B_0.</i>

286
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:17,596
That is the detection process.

287
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:23,709
Then we have established this week
that we have relaxation for <i>T2</i>

288
00:18:23,709 --> 00:18:28,432
that decays and for <i>T1</i> which builds up.

289
00:18:28,432 --> 00:18:32,021
So we have an exponential decay 
of the transverse magnetization

290
00:18:32,021 --> 00:18:37,042
and exponential return of <i>Mz</i> to <i>M_0</i>

291
00:18:37,042 --> 00:18:40,650
that's described by <i>T1</i> and <i>T2</i> relaxation.

292
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:45,041
These time constants <i>T1</i> and <i>T2</i>

293
00:18:45,041 --> 00:18:49,653
reflect the molecular environment
in which the molecule finds itself

294
00:18:49,653 --> 00:18:53,922
and they are a major source 
of contrast in MRI.

295
00:18:55,772 --> 00:18:58,549
So now some take home messages.

296
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:02,377
In MRI, we can only detect mobile spins.

297
00:19:02,377 --> 00:19:06,403
So typically of major interest 
here is water.

298
00:19:06,403 --> 00:19:08,975
Immobile nuclei--

299
00:19:08,975 --> 00:19:11,535
nuclei that are part of a molecule 
that's immobile--

300
00:19:11,535 --> 00:19:12,934
are not detected.

301
00:19:13,744 --> 00:19:18,944
The equilibrium magnetization 
reflects the number of nuclei

302
00:19:18,944 --> 00:19:22,373
and thus the water content in tissue.

303
00:19:22,373 --> 00:19:26,094
Now, water content typically varies
between 70 and 100%

304
00:19:26,094 --> 00:19:30,989
or 70 milliliters per 100 gram 
to 100 milliliters per 100 gram

305
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:32,788
in our bodies.

306
00:19:32,788 --> 00:19:37,126
And so it is actually 
not a good source of contrast.

307
00:19:38,216 --> 00:19:44,649
To detect tissue contrast, 
we rely on differences between <i>T1</i> and <i>T2.</i>

308
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:47,491
Those <i>T1</i> and <i>T2</i> differences,

309
00:19:47,491 --> 00:19:50,931
how they manifest themselves
on the image contrast

310
00:19:50,931 --> 00:19:54,727
depends strongly on 
the experimental parameters.

311
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,538
Examples that we have seen, 
are RF pulse timing

312
00:19:57,538 --> 00:19:59,298
or generally pulse timing,

313
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:03,369
and another example here 
is the flip angle <i>alpha</i>

314
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:07,911
by which the magnetization is tilted 
into the transverse plane.

315
00:20:08,631 --> 00:20:10,760
So these are the key messages.

316
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:15,003
This is what we have so far dealt with:
magnetic resonance.

317
00:20:15,003 --> 00:20:18,360
Next week we will talk about spectroscopy

318
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:25,017
and this makes a link between MRI 
and the chemical applications

319
00:20:25,017 --> 00:20:27,422
of magnetic resonance.
