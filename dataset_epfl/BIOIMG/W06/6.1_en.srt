1
00:00:04,244 --> 00:00:08,146
The subject of this week's lectures
is positron emission tomography,

2
00:00:08,146 --> 00:00:12,336
which is the twin technology
to emission computed tomography

3
00:00:12,336 --> 00:00:14,727
that we dealt with last week.

4
00:00:14,727 --> 00:00:20,920
First, I want to start out with 
some examples that illustrate

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,870
what this technique does.

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:25,329
The first we'll see here--

7
00:00:25,329 --> 00:00:28,567
this is a positron emission
tomography scan--

8
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:30,210
we can see the whole subject.

9
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,551
Here you can see the arms,
and you see on the top--

10
00:00:33,551 --> 00:00:38,391
very bright uptake in the head,

11
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:41,816
and you see a lot of spots
highlighted in the body--

12
00:00:41,816 --> 00:00:43,406
those are metastases.

13
00:00:43,406 --> 00:00:48,328
And that, actually, in the clinical
application has been a major motivation

14
00:00:48,328 --> 00:00:51,603
for this technique-- 
this is the easy detection of metastases

15
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:54,583
in cancer patients.

16
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:59,766
Here, in this video, you see also,
this is a deoxyglucose uptake scan--

17
00:00:59,766 --> 00:01:05,357
you'll see on the top there-- brain,
which has a lot of uptake--

18
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:08,239
in the bottom, you see the bladder--
you see in the middle the heart,

19
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:11,430
and if you see, just above the heart--
this little spot there--

20
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,717
that spot shouldn't be there.

21
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:16,526
That is a metastasis in this poor patient.

22
00:01:17,351 --> 00:01:22,150
We have the application, actually,
is PET/CT nowadays.

23
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:25,032
You can actually, nowadays, no longer buy
just a pure PET scanner--

24
00:01:25,032 --> 00:01:28,266
you buy a PET/CT scanner.

25
00:01:28,266 --> 00:01:31,072
And the reason as illustrated here
in this example--

26
00:01:31,072 --> 00:01:35,280
these are transaxial scans--
you can see, here, on the CT scans,

27
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,514
you see bright-- the rib cage--
you see the heart-- dark is the lung,

28
00:01:38,514 --> 00:01:43,393
there are no electrons in the lung,
so we don't have any absorption here.

29
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:45,986
And these are-- this is the heart, here.

30
00:01:45,986 --> 00:01:50,547
So, the CT scan provides anatomical
resolution, and the PET scan

31
00:01:50,547 --> 00:01:54,683
brings a functional metabolic information.

32
00:01:54,683 --> 00:01:58,103
And here we see in the PET scan,
we see uptake here in this spot.

33
00:01:58,103 --> 00:02:02,103
This is not very informative to figure out
what is actually going on and where--

34
00:02:02,103 --> 00:02:05,941
but if it's overlaid on the grayscale
image-- so, we'll take this image,

35
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:09,822
we'll take this image here,
and they are all fused--

36
00:02:09,822 --> 00:02:12,971
color coded the PET data--
one can see very clearly

37
00:02:12,971 --> 00:02:16,794
where this bright spot of uptake
is in the body.

38
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:18,866
This is the coronal scans--
so, we are now looking

39
00:02:18,866 --> 00:02:20,265
as if you are looking at me.

40
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:24,357
So, you see the neck is here,
here are the arms,

41
00:02:24,357 --> 00:02:28,278
and we have the corresponding PET scan,
again with the high uptake.

42
00:02:28,278 --> 00:02:31,871
When you fuse the CT scan,
here on the left, with the PET scan,

43
00:02:31,871 --> 00:02:33,742
one can see where the high uptake is.

44
00:02:33,742 --> 00:02:39,103
That is where the new plastic lesion
exactly is positioned.

45
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,449
So, what does a PET scanner look like?

46
00:02:42,449 --> 00:02:44,680
And a PET scanner is shown here.

47
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:47,940
We have a scanner with a nice white cover.

48
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:53,930
We don't want to expose the patient
to all the physics and engineering

49
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:57,442
that's behind it, so there's a nice cover
that makes it less intimidating,

50
00:02:57,442 --> 00:03:01,424
the patient bed, here's a hole,
that this is now set up for a brain scan--

51
00:03:01,424 --> 00:03:05,644
for the head, and this will go here
into the hole, where the detection

52
00:03:05,644 --> 00:03:09,528
is being done of the head scan.

53
00:03:09,528 --> 00:03:12,499
Now, what is inside that scanner?

54
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:15,525
What is inside that scanner
is a detector ring,

55
00:03:15,525 --> 00:03:19,224
and this is very much the same technology
that we discussed last week.

56
00:03:19,224 --> 00:03:22,823
It's the same principle of detection,
you have scintillation crystals,

57
00:03:22,823 --> 00:03:26,050
photomultipliers, 
and then the electronics.

58
00:03:26,050 --> 00:03:30,109
The difference here is it's an entire
detection ring that is being used

59
00:03:30,109 --> 00:03:33,985
for positron emission tomography--
and we'll see in a short while

60
00:03:33,985 --> 00:03:37,580
why this is different from SPECT.

61
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:41,613
So, this goes in here--
it's actually inside the cover.

62
00:03:41,613 --> 00:03:44,617
So, let's look at the picture 
with the cover removed.

63
00:03:44,617 --> 00:03:46,817
And here is now such a scanner.

64
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:50,416
We have a sphere here filled 
with some substance.

65
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,746
And so, here you can see
the cover removed,

66
00:03:52,746 --> 00:03:55,535
and here we can see the detector ring,
this is the patient bed.

67
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:59,153
So, that's what's inside a PET scanner.

68
00:03:59,153 --> 00:04:02,179
Here, I give you examples 
of some brain scans.

69
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:06,110
On the bottom, we have the scans
taken 1975--

70
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,866
one can see that it is a brain,
but it's quite blurry,

71
00:04:08,866 --> 00:04:13,066
and you can appreciate the 20 years
of technological development here

72
00:04:13,066 --> 00:04:18,241
if you look, now, at the brain scan here
taken from 1995--

73
00:04:18,241 --> 00:04:21,380
here, we can see very nicely
the gray matter, which has higher uptake

74
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:25,141
of the tracer in the brain.

75
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,728
Now, on this video here--
what I want to show here

76
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:34,929
is the start of the scan--
so, we have the patient on the bed,

77
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:38,727
the bed is lifted automatically,
and then moved into the gurney,

78
00:04:38,727 --> 00:04:43,341
and the patient is preparing
for the scan-- so, to give us an idea

79
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:46,731
how this scan is being done.

80
00:04:47,254 --> 00:04:50,023
So, these are the human scanners.

81
00:04:50,023 --> 00:04:53,326
The detection, as I mentioned,
is very similar to SPECT,

82
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:57,783
but the principle is different,
and this has to do

83
00:04:57,783 --> 00:05:00,745
with the detection principle,
and therefore, this has an impact

84
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:05,715
on the instrumentation of the positron
emission tomography or PET scanner.

85
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:10,050
Now, let's look at some examples
of animal models.

86
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,469
So, we have, first, the scanner here.

87
00:05:13,469 --> 00:05:14,831
So, let's look at the scanner.

88
00:05:14,831 --> 00:05:16,949
It's a smaller scanner.

89
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,280
We can appreciate that.

90
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:21,581
This is about body height, here.

91
00:05:21,581 --> 00:05:25,772
Here's the bed where the mouse
will be placed or the rodent.

92
00:05:25,772 --> 00:05:28,197
Here's the opening, and we can see
from the dimensions

93
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:30,281
a human would certainly not fit in here.

94
00:05:30,281 --> 00:05:34,833
As we have seen with CT or SPECT,
the scanner that is used

95
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:39,662
for animal scanning is smaller--
it's adapted to the smaller size

96
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:42,910
of the species being investigated--

97
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:47,090
and this is the standard approach here.

98
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:50,193
Interestingly, they still cover up 
the electronics-- it's probably more

99
00:05:50,193 --> 00:05:55,914
for the protection of the electronics,
here, rather than appeasing

100
00:05:55,914 --> 00:06:00,421
the volunteer, here, 
who is an anesthetized rodent.

101
00:06:00,421 --> 00:06:04,647
Rodents-- this is a rat here,
they have to be anesthetized,

102
00:06:04,647 --> 00:06:06,790
otherwise, they start moving around.

103
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:09,831
So, here's the opening of the scanner,
the anesthesia mask,

104
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:14,138
and here we can see a scan
of the mouse's brain.

105
00:06:15,553 --> 00:06:17,186
Here are some examples.

106
00:06:17,186 --> 00:06:21,356
We have on the left-- we have
the optical imaging--

107
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:23,556
this is herpes simplex virus--

108
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:28,096
mediated imaging of gene expression
on the right-- we have a tracer

109
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:33,793
that images where this gene
has been expressed.

110
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:38,258
Here's another example of optical imaging
here in the bottom.

111
00:06:38,258 --> 00:06:41,896
And on the top, the positron emission
tomography scan,

112
00:06:41,896 --> 00:06:47,385
and these are the two types of tumors--
one's resistant and one's sensitive

113
00:06:47,385 --> 00:06:50,254
to chemotherapy.

114
00:06:51,314 --> 00:06:56,907
If we look at the atypical publication,
this is a figure taken from a paper--

115
00:06:56,907 --> 00:06:59,019
then we have a lot of information.

116
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:03,383
We have the PET scans, here, 
with this FHPG tracer,

117
00:07:03,383 --> 00:07:07,009
and here with the FDG tracer,
showing the PET images.

118
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,460
Here are the analysis 
with different treatments.

119
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:12,598
So, what you'll see in research
is that biomedical imaging

120
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:16,600
here with positron emission tomography
is very often an integral part

121
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:18,350
of the study.

122
00:07:19,290 --> 00:07:23,580
So now, let's come to the question--
what is positron emission tomography?

123
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:28,458
Or PET, as we call it in shorter term.

124
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:32,134
Basically, what we are measuring
with positron emission tomography--

125
00:07:32,134 --> 00:07:35,274
there's the word positron in there--
and what we are looking at

126
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:39,543
is the annihilation of positrons 
with electrons-- this gives rise

127
00:07:39,543 --> 00:07:44,177
to x-rays that are being emitted
from the annihilation process.

128
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:48,404
This is the basic principle
that is behind it.

129
00:07:49,403 --> 00:07:52,951
The positrons are emitted
by a parent nucleus--

130
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:57,903
that's typically part of a tracer

131
00:07:57,903 --> 00:07:59,613
that's administered to the subject--

132
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:03,634
so, it's an exogenous substance
that's not naturally occurring,

133
00:08:03,634 --> 00:08:06,762
which we desire to image.

134
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:10,731
So, we'll inject the tracer here,
and the days it distributes,

135
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:14,393
as we can see here now, with the subject
turning more and more red,

136
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:17,846
and then we have the x-rays
that are being emitted

137
00:08:17,846 --> 00:08:21,471
in all sorts of directions.

138
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:23,688
And now, we have two issues.

139
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:26,170
As with SPECT-- they're actually
the same issues--

140
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:32,324
one is when we detect an x-ray,
how do we know what it's direction was.

141
00:08:32,324 --> 00:08:38,171
Remember, with SPECT, we used collimation
for determining direction of the x-rays--

142
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:40,724
here, the principle 
will be slightly different.

143
00:08:40,724 --> 00:08:45,097
So, we still have to deal 
with this question.

144
00:08:45,097 --> 00:08:49,831
And as in SPECT, we have absorption
that is undesirable.

145
00:08:49,831 --> 00:08:54,986
Remember, with CT scanning, absorption
was the contrast generating parameter.

146
00:08:54,986 --> 00:08:58,527
We irradiate the subject with x-rays,
and we want to see

147
00:08:58,527 --> 00:09:01,956
the different absorption--
that's the basis of CT scanning.

148
00:09:01,956 --> 00:09:05,356
With SPECT and also with PET,
the absorption is, in principle,

149
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:10,884
undesirable, and it would be nice
if that would not happen.

150
00:09:10,884 --> 00:09:14,844
So, we have to consider this
as a nuisance effect.

151
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:21,636
So, this is the situation with PET--
very similar to SPECT

152
00:09:21,636 --> 00:09:25,081
or emission computed tomography.

153
00:09:25,082 --> 00:09:29,796
So, the principle, therefore, is similar
as what we discussed last week with SPECT,

154
00:09:29,796 --> 00:09:33,746
but there is a major difference, 
and you will see, in a short while,

155
00:09:33,746 --> 00:09:35,816
where this difference comes from.

156
00:09:36,796 --> 00:09:40,290
So, if you look at the set up
of a PET scanner,

157
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,953
we have the detector ring,
here is the subject,

158
00:09:42,953 --> 00:09:47,862
we have electronics, here is a coincidence
processing unit, we have the computer

159
00:09:47,862 --> 00:09:51,391
for the reconstruction, and here we have
the process that's at the heart

160
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:56,351
of what we are detecting, and that's 
the annihilation of the positron.

161
00:09:57,161 --> 00:10:01,706
So, the most widely used tracer for PET
is fluorodeoxyglucose--

162
00:10:01,706 --> 00:10:06,144
it's the glucose where there's a flourine
attached at the two position--

163
00:10:06,144 --> 00:10:08,685
here's the example of this diagram, here.

164
00:10:08,685 --> 00:10:10,985
This is the one position, 
here's the two position--

165
00:10:10,985 --> 00:10:14,323
instead of an OH group,
there's a flourine attached, here.

166
00:10:14,323 --> 00:10:19,462
And here's the three dimensional graphic--
in green, you can see the fluorine atom

167
00:10:19,462 --> 00:10:21,691
at this position-- fluorine 18.

168
00:10:21,691 --> 00:10:26,582
So, fluorine 18 is an unstable nucleus
that decays, and as it decays

169
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:28,311
it emits a positron.

170
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:35,422
So, we are looking at imaging antimatter--
that is the annihilation of antimatter--

171
00:10:35,422 --> 00:10:36,945
with matter.

172
00:10:36,945 --> 00:10:39,110
So, what is going on here?

173
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,473
So, we have the unstable 
parent nucleus, here.

174
00:10:42,473 --> 00:10:46,573
We have in red the neutrons,
and in blue, the positrons.

175
00:10:46,573 --> 00:10:50,612
And now, when this unstable nucleus 
decays, there is a conversion

176
00:10:50,612 --> 00:10:53,337
of a positron to a neutron.

177
00:10:53,337 --> 00:10:57,401
So, we're changing the charge
by minus one.

178
00:10:57,891 --> 00:10:59,316
We'll have a different charge.

179
00:10:59,316 --> 00:11:01,756
We have charge conservation.

180
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:05,002
So, we will have this positive charge
emitted from the nucleus

181
00:11:05,002 --> 00:11:07,387
in the form of a positron.

182
00:11:07,387 --> 00:11:09,875
And this positron diffuses 
through the tissue,

183
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,446
undergoes different interactions,

184
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:17,936
akin to the electrostatic 
Coulomb interaction,

185
00:11:17,936 --> 00:11:20,869
just like we've seen with bremsstrahlung.

186
00:11:20,869 --> 00:11:24,746
And after this positron has lost
most of its kinetic energy,

187
00:11:24,746 --> 00:11:28,530
at some point, it will be attracted
by a nearby electron--

188
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:32,729
the two get together-- they combine,
it's matter and antimatter,

189
00:11:32,729 --> 00:11:37,995
and when matter and antimatter
come together, they are annihilated,

190
00:11:37,995 --> 00:11:42,757
so, there is the emission of two x-rays.

191
00:11:45,007 --> 00:11:50,919
To give you an idea, these x-rays travel
at 3 times 10^8 meters per second,

192
00:11:50,919 --> 00:11:53,278
so, in 3 nanoseconds, the x-ray

193
00:11:53,278 --> 00:11:58,118
will have traversed 1 meter

194
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:02,581
in the scanner.

195
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:06,320
So, now, question: Why are two photons
being produced?

196
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,170
Why not just one?

197
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:11,911
We could, in principle, have the electron
and the positron combine.

198
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:16,726
From an objective standpoint, 
we could produce a single photon.

199
00:12:17,476 --> 00:12:22,304
Remember, that we said that the positron
and electron-- the positron loses

200
00:12:22,304 --> 00:12:24,119
most of its kinetic energy.

201
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:27,572
So, let's consider the situation, 
idealized-- that the positron

202
00:12:27,572 --> 00:12:32,093
and the electron, at the time
of annihilation, have zero kinetic energy.

203
00:12:32,093 --> 00:12:36,783
So, the total linear momentum
of the positron-electron pair is zero.

204
00:12:37,601 --> 00:12:41,904
If we had a single photon that's emitted,
that photon would have energy.

205
00:12:41,904 --> 00:12:46,887
And if it has energy, as we've discussed
two weeks ago-- three weeks ago,

206
00:12:46,887 --> 00:12:49,512
the photon carries a linear momentum.

207
00:12:49,512 --> 00:12:51,933
So, if we have a single photon,
we would have, suddenly,

208
00:12:51,933 --> 00:12:54,869
a net linear momentum-- 
and this would violate

209
00:12:54,869 --> 00:12:57,327
conservation of linear momentum.

210
00:12:57,327 --> 00:12:59,936
If we have two photons 
that go in opposite directions,

211
00:12:59,936 --> 00:13:05,479
those two photons, with equal energy,
would produce a situation

212
00:13:05,479 --> 00:13:09,302
with zero net linear momentum.

213
00:13:09,302 --> 00:13:13,971
So, this is a consequence 
of the conservation of linear momentum--

214
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:17,377
that we need to have two photons.

215
00:13:17,377 --> 00:13:19,747
What is the energy of the photons?

216
00:13:19,747 --> 00:13:24,330
Well, the energy of the photons, at rest--
there's two electrons--

217
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:28,468
masses of electrons-- the electron
and positron-- that convert into energy.

218
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:33,115
So, we have a total energy of [mec^2]--
we have 2 times [mec^2]--

219
00:13:33,115 --> 00:13:35,952
but we have two photons--
so, one of those photons

220
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:40,173
has an energy of [mec^2], and that is,
in kiloelectron volts,

221
00:13:40,173 --> 00:13:43,386
that's around 510 kiloelectron volts.

222
00:13:43,386 --> 00:13:47,730
I'm giving here, also, the conversion
of electronvolt into joules,

223
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,725
if you ever wish to verify 
this calculation with SI units,

224
00:13:51,725 --> 00:13:56,399
using c^2 and the mass of the electron.

225
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:57,858
So, now, what does this mean?

226
00:13:57,858 --> 00:14:02,229
This basically means-- in order 
to determine the location

227
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:06,292
of an annihilation event,
what we need to do

228
00:14:06,292 --> 00:14:09,294
is we need in the detector--
we need to select two events

229
00:14:09,294 --> 00:14:11,924
that happened simultaneously--
that is, two x-rays

230
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:15,108
that we detect simultaneously,
at the same time.

231
00:14:15,108 --> 00:14:19,335
And then, we will know, that if we have
a detection here and a detection here,

232
00:14:19,335 --> 00:14:22,779
then we will know somewhere
along this line, there has been

233
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:27,037
an annihilation of an electron
and a positron.

234
00:14:27,037 --> 00:14:31,015
And this is the basic detection principle.

235
00:14:31,015 --> 00:14:35,028
As a side note, here, notice here
that the light travels around the meter

236
00:14:35,028 --> 00:14:38,088
in 3 nano-seconds--
that's an awfully short time.

237
00:14:38,088 --> 00:14:43,091
This, in general, does not allow us
to determine the exact location

238
00:14:43,091 --> 00:14:46,806
of the electron-positron
annihilation process.

239
00:14:46,806 --> 00:14:52,020
It is too imprecise, as we will see later,
the time resolution of the scanner

240
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:57,452
being below 3 nanoseconds
is not the typical time resolution

241
00:14:57,452 --> 00:15:00,340
that the detection materials provide us.

242
00:15:03,339 --> 00:15:07,469
So, what we have here, then-- 
the principle is annihilation

243
00:15:07,469 --> 00:15:09,085
coincidence detection.

244
00:15:09,085 --> 00:15:12,365
The basic principle is we detect
two photons at the same time,

245
00:15:12,365 --> 00:15:16,633
we attribute a location--
somewhere along the line

246
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:19,284
that connects the two detectors.

247
00:15:19,284 --> 00:15:22,615
And somewhere along this line,
we had an annihilation

248
00:15:22,615 --> 00:15:26,094
of a positron and an electron.

249
00:15:26,094 --> 00:15:28,428
So, what does this mean?

250
00:15:28,428 --> 00:15:31,177
Well, it means we detect two events
at the same time,

251
00:15:31,177 --> 00:15:36,153
and this defines the event along a line.

252
00:15:36,153 --> 00:15:40,991
Moreover, we do not need a collimator.

253
00:15:40,991 --> 00:15:46,042
So, for positron emission tomography,
there's the difference between SPECT

254
00:15:46,042 --> 00:15:49,536
and positron emission tomography,
due to the fact of annihilation

255
00:15:49,536 --> 00:15:55,704
coincidence detection on the two sides,
we do not need to have a collimator

256
00:15:55,704 --> 00:15:58,367
to establish the directionality 
of the x-ray.

257
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:02,767
This is done by the coincidence
detection process.

258
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,102
So, what is coincidence detection?

259
00:16:07,102 --> 00:16:10,444
What do we do when 
we do coincidence detection?

260
00:16:10,444 --> 00:16:13,590
Just as a reminder, we'll start out here
when you have the positron

261
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:17,755
that's emitted by nucleus, diffuses,
annihilates with the electron,

262
00:16:17,755 --> 00:16:22,087
and produces two 510 kiloelectron volts
x-rays that are going

263
00:16:22,087 --> 00:16:24,144
in opposite directions.

264
00:16:24,144 --> 00:16:27,911
We detect them simultaneously,
and this establishes lines of incidence--

265
00:16:27,911 --> 00:16:31,372
along this line has been the event.

266
00:16:31,372 --> 00:16:35,410
This simultaneous detection 
provides the collimation--

267
00:16:35,410 --> 00:16:40,281
it's electronic collimation, 
and this gives us the directionality

268
00:16:40,281 --> 00:16:42,156
of the x-rays.

269
00:16:42,156 --> 00:16:44,572
So, let's look at the situation
in the detector.

270
00:16:44,572 --> 00:16:48,240
We have an x-ray that hits
our scintillation crystal.

271
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:52,953
Here, the detection principle
is the same as the principle used

272
00:16:52,953 --> 00:16:54,631
for SPECT.

273
00:16:54,631 --> 00:16:58,483
This produces, as we've discussed
last week, visible light.

274
00:16:58,483 --> 00:17:03,298
This visible light produced is amplified
by the photomultiplier tubes,

275
00:17:03,298 --> 00:17:06,731
and in the end, we've produced
an electronic signal

276
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:09,076
that looks like something like this.

277
00:17:09,076 --> 00:17:12,286
This is what the signal 
that's being detected.

278
00:17:12,286 --> 00:17:14,803
And let's say, we take 
these two detectors, here--

279
00:17:14,803 --> 00:17:18,932
we have these two signals, here.

280
00:17:18,932 --> 00:17:21,894
To determine the precise time--
because we want to determine

281
00:17:21,894 --> 00:17:26,785
simultaneity for coincidence detection--
one wants to have a precise measure

282
00:17:26,785 --> 00:17:29,767
of the time, and this is done 
on the leading edge

283
00:17:29,767 --> 00:17:32,178
of the amplified signal.

284
00:17:32,178 --> 00:17:34,473
This is steeper, so it is sharper,

285
00:17:34,473 --> 00:17:38,003
and it has a higher first derivative.

286
00:17:38,973 --> 00:17:42,356
So, now, question: how do we define
simultaneity?

287
00:17:42,356 --> 00:17:44,028
That is, coincidence?

288
00:17:44,528 --> 00:17:48,969
Well, the answer could be, let's just say,
they have to be at the same time.

289
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:51,715
But what does it mean
to be at the same time?

290
00:17:51,715 --> 00:17:55,355
In an ideal world, on a piece of paper,
in theory, same time means

291
00:17:55,355 --> 00:17:59,129
at the same time, precisely--
down to attosecond precision.

292
00:17:59,129 --> 00:18:02,429
But we're dealing with an instrument--
we're dealing with imperfections--

293
00:18:02,429 --> 00:18:07,751
and so defining simultaneity
requires a certain uncertainty

294
00:18:07,751 --> 00:18:09,005
that one allows.

295
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:12,309
Within which time interval do we
consider two events

296
00:18:12,309 --> 00:18:15,362
that are being detected 
as being simultaneous?

297
00:18:16,232 --> 00:18:19,616
So, the situation here
is in this graphic here.

298
00:18:19,616 --> 00:18:24,095
We have a detector A, a detector B,
we detect a signal in detector A--

299
00:18:24,095 --> 00:18:27,803
this could be this one--
detector B could be this one, for example,

300
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:29,227
and we get two signals.

301
00:18:29,227 --> 00:18:32,253
And now, we want to say--
determine if these two signals

302
00:18:32,253 --> 00:18:34,850
are simultaneous or not.

303
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:37,702
So, we're getting a signal A--
we're detecting the leading edge

304
00:18:37,702 --> 00:18:40,177
of signal A-- the leading edge 
of signal B--

305
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:43,042
and then, what is-- in practice,
is being done,

306
00:18:43,042 --> 00:18:48,040
we define a coincidence interval-- tau--
which has a certain value in here--

307
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:53,411
for the BGO crystal it is, typically,
10 nanoseconds.

308
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:57,923
So, anything that's within this interval--

309
00:18:57,923 --> 00:19:01,861
2 times tau-- is considered
as being simultaneous.

310
00:19:01,861 --> 00:19:05,339
So, these events, if they happen 
within 20 nanoseconds,

311
00:19:05,339 --> 00:19:08,404
we would say this has happened
simultaneously,

312
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:11,248
and we'll consider them

313
00:19:11,248 --> 00:19:15,288
as being due to the annihilation process.

314
00:19:16,158 --> 00:19:20,972
If we now recap what the detector
is made of-- you see the graphic here--

315
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:24,032
and you'll say, "Wait, this is the same
as in SPECT."

316
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:27,044
And what I'm drawing you here
is actually the same situation

317
00:19:27,044 --> 00:19:30,000
as what we have in the SPECT scanner.

318
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:33,255
So, we're looking at the gamma camera,
the basic elements, here--

319
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:36,663
now, it's the PET camera,
we have the scintillating crystal--

320
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:39,830
this is unchanged-- 
we have the photomultipliers--

321
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:44,889
it is the same thing-- so, we have
the scintillation crystal,

322
00:19:44,889 --> 00:19:48,703
the photomultipliers, we have, also,
position logic electronics,

323
00:19:48,703 --> 00:19:51,182
and the light guide--
this is all the same,

324
00:19:51,182 --> 00:19:54,622
and here, I have drawn the collimator.

325
00:19:56,483 --> 00:20:00,223
But wait, didn't I just say 
we don't need a collimator?

326
00:20:01,043 --> 00:20:06,329
Well, this is the situation-- 
what you have with the SPECT scanner.

327
00:20:06,329 --> 00:20:09,815
And with the PET scanner, we have said
we do not need the collimator,

328
00:20:09,815 --> 00:20:11,409
so we can forget about this.

329
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:16,370
Here's a piece of the instrumentation
of the detection process

330
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:18,984
that we don't need in PET scanning,

331
00:20:18,984 --> 00:20:21,984
because we have the simultaneity of events

332
00:20:21,984 --> 00:20:25,203
that establishes-- with which
we can establish the direction

333
00:20:25,203 --> 00:20:27,525
of the x-rays that are being detected.

334
00:20:28,925 --> 00:20:30,259
So, what is the consequence

335
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:34,949
of not having the need for collimators?

336
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:41,390
One consequence is that this 
is an increase in sensitivity

337
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:43,207
that comes from that.

338
00:20:43,207 --> 00:20:44,812
Now, why is this so?

339
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:47,013
Let's think about it.

340
00:20:47,973 --> 00:20:52,622
Why are we getting an increase
in sensitivity

341
00:20:52,622 --> 00:20:55,183
if we do not need collimators?

342
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:59,320
Remember, the process of collimation
is brute force.

343
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,220
We just basically say we put the material
in place that blocks the x-rays

344
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,791
that do not satisfy our geometric
condition of collinearity.

345
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,390
So, what we're doing
is we're taking x-rays,

346
00:21:10,390 --> 00:21:14,726
and we're eliminating the bad guys
with the wrong geometrical arrangement.

347
00:21:14,726 --> 00:21:18,821
So, this collimation is the process
of establishing directionality

348
00:21:18,821 --> 00:21:22,671
by eliminating all the x-rays
that are not coming in

349
00:21:22,671 --> 00:21:26,971
perpendicular 
to the scintillation crystal.

350
00:21:26,971 --> 00:21:31,124
Whereas, with positron emission
tomography, due to the detection

351
00:21:31,124 --> 00:21:33,590
of simultaneous events, we don't do that.

352
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:38,773
So, we can, essentially, accept all x-rays
that are being detected,

353
00:21:38,773 --> 00:21:44,072
as long as they are simultaneous, that is,
as long as they are x-ray pairs.

354
00:21:45,193 --> 00:21:49,063
So, this is a major source
of sensitivity increase

355
00:21:49,063 --> 00:21:52,810
for positron emission tomography
compared to SPECT.
