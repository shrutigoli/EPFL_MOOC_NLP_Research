1
00:00:04,186 --> 00:00:07,123
In this section we'll discuss

2
00:00:07,123 --> 00:00:10,018
the measurements
that are being done by PET.

3
00:00:10,018 --> 00:00:15,337
I first want to start by looking
at the detection process in general,

4
00:00:15,337 --> 00:00:17,427
so we'll have an object here.

5
00:00:17,427 --> 00:00:19,941
This almost looks like a face here.
It's just an object.

6
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:21,941
You could think of this as the nose.

7
00:00:22,915 --> 00:00:24,753
We'll put here on the detector ring,

8
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:26,384
we'll have a <i>detector a</i>

9
00:00:26,384 --> 00:00:28,654
and a <i>detector b</i> here.

10
00:00:30,325 --> 00:00:34,278
These are just two arbitrary detectors
that I've chosen out of the whole ring.

11
00:00:34,278 --> 00:00:37,770
The rest, I haven't drawn here,
so we have detector <i>a</i> and detector <i>b</i>

12
00:00:39,237 --> 00:00:42,985
Now, we have an annihilation
of a positron and an electron

13
00:00:42,985 --> 00:00:46,204
that is indicated here at this location

14
00:00:46,204 --> 00:00:49,703
and now we'll look
at the true coincidence.

15
00:00:49,703 --> 00:00:52,204
True coincidence
is we have the two photons

16
00:00:52,204 --> 00:00:55,032
that are being sent off
in opposite directions

17
00:00:55,032 --> 00:00:58,627
and detected simultaneously
in detector <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.

18
00:00:59,658 --> 00:01:03,460
Here's the schematic presentation
with the scheme, an oval.

19
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,659
Here's the process, the annihilation.

20
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:07,767
These are the two photons
going in each direction,

21
00:01:07,767 --> 00:01:11,778
and these two crystals
will detect the X-ray,

22
00:01:11,778 --> 00:01:17,094
or if you prefer, with an image
of an object, of a subject in here,

23
00:01:17,094 --> 00:01:21,419
the heart, the lung.
We have here the annihilation process

24
00:01:21,419 --> 00:01:22,774
for the "trues".

25
00:01:22,774 --> 00:01:26,337
We have the X-rays
going in opposite directions.

26
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,365
This is what we've outlined.

27
00:01:29,365 --> 00:01:32,388
This is the process
of what we want to measure,

28
00:01:32,388 --> 00:01:35,741
so we have a certain number
of true counts,

29
00:01:35,741 --> 00:01:37,709
that is, simultaneous events
that we measure.

30
00:01:37,709 --> 00:01:39,559
We'll call this the "trues":

31
00:01:39,559 --> 00:01:43,061
Big <i>T</i> for "true coincidence"

32
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:47,257
and AB, true coincidence
between detector <i>a</i> and detector <i>b</i>.

33
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:53,836
What we are actually measuring
out of detector pair <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>

34
00:01:53,836 --> 00:01:56,844
is the mesurement <i>Yab</i>

35
00:01:56,844 --> 00:02:01,511
Again, <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> designate
the two detectors <i>a</i> and <i>b</i>.

36
00:02:01,511 --> 00:02:04,000
Here, their position
is not really important,

37
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,734
but we have them here

38
00:02:05,734 --> 00:02:08,643
so this is what is measured.

39
00:02:08,643 --> 00:02:10,501
If you look at what is now shown here,

40
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:13,115
we have a lot of empty spaces
around the <i>trues</i>.

41
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:16,066
In an ideal world,
this would be equal to this,

42
00:02:16,066 --> 00:02:19,626
but there are quite a few
things to consider.

43
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:24,165
The next what we consider
is a scattered coincidence.

44
00:02:24,165 --> 00:02:26,001
What we mean by scattered coincidence

45
00:02:26,001 --> 00:02:30,100
is we have an annihilation process.
Now it's here, and at least

46
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:34,435
one of the photons is being
Compton scattered in the tissue

47
00:02:34,435 --> 00:02:36,799
so it's being deviated by a certain angle,

48
00:02:36,799 --> 00:02:42,843
and in this case the electron-positron
emission annihilation happens here,

49
00:02:43,515 --> 00:02:46,420
but the scattering
of this photon here is such

50
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,707
that it arrives still in detector <i>b</i>.

51
00:02:49,982 --> 00:02:54,856
This detector cannot distinguish
so we have scattered coincidences.

52
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:58,824
Here's, schematically, another graphic.
Here's the annihilation.

53
00:02:59,397 --> 00:03:03,085
At least one of the photons
is Compton scattered,

54
00:03:03,085 --> 00:03:07,590
and this gives us a line of incidence
that goes here or here with the object,

55
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,163
subject in place.

56
00:03:09,163 --> 00:03:11,479
We have Compton scattering
of one of the X-rays,

57
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:15,973
and these two detectors here
are responding simultaneously.

58
00:03:17,028 --> 00:03:20,495
So what we have is in addition
to the true coincidences,

59
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:22,899
we have scattered coincidences.

60
00:03:23,728 --> 00:03:29,247
Then we have random coincidences,
and random coincidences are coincidences

61
00:03:29,247 --> 00:03:35,028
where we have simultaneously two
positron electron annihilation processes.

62
00:03:35,787 --> 00:03:38,364
Of these four photons
that are being produced,

63
00:03:38,364 --> 00:03:40,117
we are losing two.

64
00:03:40,117 --> 00:03:44,420
Whether we lose them in the body
or whether we lose them in the detector,

65
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:47,440
for some reason we are losing
two of the photons.

66
00:03:47,955 --> 00:03:51,695
What happens now
is we have two events here,

67
00:03:51,695 --> 00:03:53,675
this one and this one.

68
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:58,178
One of the annihilation photons
is not being detected for this process,

69
00:03:58,178 --> 00:04:01,186
and one of the annihilation photons
in this process does not happen

70
00:04:01,186 --> 00:04:02,862
to be detected.

71
00:04:02,862 --> 00:04:07,143
So for some reason we have had
the photon go into this detector

72
00:04:07,143 --> 00:04:09,505
and the photon go in this detector.

73
00:04:09,505 --> 00:04:14,451
So the scanner will also
think these are a coincidence.

74
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:17,097
Here's the illustration schematically.

75
00:04:17,097 --> 00:04:19,736
We have one photon lost,
this one and this one,

76
00:04:19,736 --> 00:04:23,636
and here with the depiction of the body;

77
00:04:23,636 --> 00:04:26,317
two events simultaneously,
and two of the photons

78
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:29,897
are by whatever process,
doesn't matter what the process is.

79
00:04:29,897 --> 00:04:34,862
They are lost and we detect only
from each of the annihilation processes

80
00:04:34,862 --> 00:04:38,103
one of the photons,
but they are happening simultaneously.

81
00:04:38,939 --> 00:04:42,354
We have, this is what it's called,
the <i>randoms</i> as well.

82
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,940
Then we have to consider multiple events.

83
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:51,478
There the computer can say
"I've seen three events simultaneously.

84
00:04:51,478 --> 00:04:53,608
There's something not right.
I can discard them."

85
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:57,503
For the trues we have to consider
the attenuation

86
00:04:57,503 --> 00:05:00,546
so we have to take
into account attenuation.

87
00:05:00,546 --> 00:05:04,112
Remember, the X-rays
travel in general through the body,

88
00:05:04,112 --> 00:05:09,207
so not all the X-rays
will be arriving at the detector,

89
00:05:09,207 --> 00:05:11,775
and we have to consider the attenuation

90
00:05:11,775 --> 00:05:15,868
to back-calculate
the specific activity in the tissue.

91
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,823
Finally, we have in this process--

92
00:05:18,823 --> 00:05:20,709
we have a normalization here.

93
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:23,906
Once we have all these events
that are being detected,

94
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,828
we also have
the normalization to consider.

95
00:05:26,828 --> 00:05:30,212
The normalization is essentially a process

96
00:05:30,212 --> 00:05:32,838
that takes into account
scanner imperfection.

97
00:05:32,838 --> 00:05:37,338
We won't talk about it in this course.
We'll just assume that this has been done,

98
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:43,163
and we are detecting the intensities
uniformly across the entire detector ring.

99
00:05:43,616 --> 00:05:47,430
But if you think of it, there's
some differences in the electronics,

100
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:50,352
in the manufacturing
of the scintillation crystal,

101
00:05:50,352 --> 00:05:55,637
so it makes perfect sense that we
don't have the same ability

102
00:05:55,637 --> 00:06:00,871
to detect the annihilation photons
between all the pairs.

103
00:06:02,467 --> 00:06:07,201
To summarize, what we are measuring is:

104
00:06:07,201 --> 00:06:10,083
the true coincidences,
scattered coincidences,

105
00:06:10,083 --> 00:06:12,181
and random coincidences,

106
00:06:12,181 --> 00:06:16,146
and we have to take into account
attenuation as well.

107
00:06:18,061 --> 00:06:21,386
So I just previously introduced
all the coincidences that we can detect,

108
00:06:21,386 --> 00:06:24,164
and now we'll discuss
two of the coincidences

109
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:26,104
that we really don't want to measure

110
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:28,722
and how we can mitigate their effects.

111
00:06:29,626 --> 00:06:31,970
Let's first look
at the random coincidences.

112
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,040
We have two nuclear transformations
that have nothing to do with each other.

113
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:41,758
They are not in the same place
and they are interacting;

114
00:06:41,758 --> 00:06:44,389
they're being detected at the same time.

115
00:06:45,331 --> 00:06:48,435
If we look at only this photon
arriving at a detector

116
00:06:48,435 --> 00:06:50,813
and only this photon
arriving at the detector,

117
00:06:50,813 --> 00:06:52,726
then what our scanner will think,

118
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:55,222
"we've got a detection here
and a detection here,

119
00:06:55,222 --> 00:06:57,269
so somewhere along this line has been

120
00:06:57,269 --> 00:07:01,059
an annihilation of a positron,"
whereas, in reality,

121
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:04,293
we had two annihilations
happening at different places.

122
00:07:05,135 --> 00:07:08,932
The scanner will actually think
that there is a line of incidence

123
00:07:08,932 --> 00:07:11,246
that is in the gray shaded area here

124
00:07:11,246 --> 00:07:13,871
in this direction, but this is erroneous

125
00:07:13,871 --> 00:07:16,570
so this gives a wrong Radon transform

126
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:19,433
and provides image distortions.

127
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:24,881
Fortunately, we can estimate
the rate of random coincidences.

128
00:07:24,881 --> 00:07:28,184
This is given by two times
the coincidence interval

129
00:07:28,184 --> 00:07:33,359
times the singles count
in the detector pairs,

130
00:07:33,359 --> 00:07:35,499
detector one and two here,

131
00:07:35,499 --> 00:07:37,390
so these are the individual counts.

132
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,668
You basically measure the counts
in each of the detectors,

133
00:07:40,668 --> 00:07:44,673
you multiply that by two times
the coincidence interval,

134
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:50,673
and this gives you the rate
of random coincidences,

135
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:55,173
and with that, you can estimate
whether the rate of random coincidences

136
00:07:55,173 --> 00:08:00,788
is important or not
compared to the trues.

137
00:08:01,868 --> 00:08:08,033
This also implies a simple way to reduce
the number of random coincidences

138
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:12,229
and this is by reducing
the coincidence interval,

139
00:08:12,229 --> 00:08:15,021
so if the material allows it, we will use

140
00:08:15,021 --> 00:08:17,881
an as short as possible
coincidence interval

141
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:21,039
compatible with the detector material.

142
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:24,720
Imagine you have a coincidence
interval of one second,

143
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,210
you'll count a lot of random events,

144
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:31,186
but if your coincidence interval
is a few nanoseconds,

145
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:33,007
you're going to count much less.

146
00:08:33,709 --> 00:08:36,179
Another consequence
that arises here is that

147
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:42,176
since the rate of randoms increases
with the singles count rate squared,

148
00:08:42,768 --> 00:08:48,105
we have a upper limit of this SNR;
the Signal to Noise Ratio of the scanner

149
00:08:48,105 --> 00:08:52,260
will not improve as we increase
the dosage to the patient.

150
00:08:52,817 --> 00:08:56,240
At some point it will be overtaken
by the random coincidences.

151
00:08:57,112 --> 00:09:01,853
So, we can minimize
the number of random events

152
00:09:01,853 --> 00:09:06,408
that are being detected by reducing
the coincidence interval.

153
00:09:06,408 --> 00:09:10,110
This, however, does not work
for scattered events.

154
00:09:11,239 --> 00:09:13,030
Why would that be so?

155
00:09:14,369 --> 00:09:18,517
Well, scattered events happen,
essentially, instantaneously,

156
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:22,544
so we have at least one
of the annihilation photons

157
00:09:22,544 --> 00:09:24,295
is Compton scattered,

158
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:28,512
so here's the detector ring
and here we have the annihilation process,

159
00:09:28,512 --> 00:09:31,749
and now one of the photons
has been Compton scattered.

160
00:09:31,749 --> 00:09:36,030
This happens instantaneously,
so we would still detect scattered events

161
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:38,765
simultaneously, one here, one here,

162
00:09:38,765 --> 00:09:44,349
so this scanner will think
that somewhere along this line

163
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:49,542
has been the annihilation,
so the line of incidence

164
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:52,029
that it will assign here
for this particular situation

165
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,257
drawn here is along this line,
and this is, of course,

166
00:09:55,257 --> 00:10:02,036
quite distant from the true location
of the positron and electron annihilation

167
00:10:02,036 --> 00:10:05,243
which happened here
in this case down here.

168
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:13,519
So with random events,
to reduce the coincidence time,

169
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,592
this allows us to minimize
the number of random counts,

170
00:10:16,592 --> 00:10:19,631
but with the scattered events,
we can't do that.

171
00:10:20,934 --> 00:10:26,828
So the question is, how can we distinguish
scattered events from a true coincidence?

172
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:32,494
We look here at an image
that has been recorded with a PET scanner.

173
00:10:32,494 --> 00:10:36,190
It is actually of a sphere
filled with radioactive material.

174
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,565
You can think of it as fluorodeoxyglucose.

175
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:41,482
The sphere and a small sphere
placed inside

176
00:10:41,482 --> 00:10:44,260
that does not contain
radioactive material.

177
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:48,487
This is what has been measured
with the PET scanner.

178
00:10:48,936 --> 00:10:52,049
If we take the same setup
and put it into a CT scanner,

179
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:55,270
this is what we see.
We see, actually, one sphere with water.

180
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:57,728
This sphere also contains water,
but non-radioactive,

181
00:10:57,728 --> 00:11:00,329
and two spheres here on the outside

182
00:11:00,329 --> 00:11:03,533
with water but not radioactive material.

183
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:07,387
So this is where we have,
if you will, tissue.

184
00:11:09,622 --> 00:11:13,747
If we look at what is
the scattered coincidences

185
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:16,243
and then the corrected image,

186
00:11:16,243 --> 00:11:19,731
we have the scattered events
are being imaged here

187
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:22,258
and if we correct this image
for the scattered events,

188
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:24,171
we get the true depiction.

189
00:11:24,171 --> 00:11:31,083
And you can see here there is clearly
a misrepresentation of the activity

190
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:35,919
into these objects because some
of the X-rays can pass through here

191
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,231
and be deviated,

192
00:11:38,231 --> 00:11:41,734
and so the scanner will think
that the radioactivity is in here

193
00:11:41,734 --> 00:11:48,714
where we have, in this case, material
where the X-rays can be scattered.

194
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:54,615
This image plus this image
gives this image,

195
00:11:54,615 --> 00:11:59,315
and we can see here that the scattering
happens also in tissues,

196
00:11:59,315 --> 00:12:02,820
assigns the wrong
Radon transform to tissues

197
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:06,639
which are not containing
radioactive material.

198
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:11,411
Most scattering at 510 kiloelectronvolts,
which is the energy

199
00:12:11,411 --> 00:12:14,812
of positron emission tomography,
happens by Compton.

200
00:12:15,638 --> 00:12:19,033
If you look at the Compton formula,
here is the general formula.

201
00:12:19,033 --> 00:12:22,575
We have a relationship
between the original photon energy

202
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,481
and the final photon energy,

203
00:12:24,481 --> 00:12:27,344
if that photon is being scattered
by an angle of <i>θ</i>.

204
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,549
Now, we know the energy of the photon.

205
00:12:30,549 --> 00:12:33,013
The energy of the photon, <i>Ei</i>,

206
00:12:33,013 --> 00:12:35,212
that's been emitted
by the annihilation process,

207
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,199
that energy is equal to <i>me c squared</i>

208
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:41,318
so I'll just put in here <i>me c squared</i>

209
00:12:41,318 --> 00:12:43,826
and here as well,
and I simplify the equation,

210
00:12:43,826 --> 00:12:47,901
and this gives me the equation
of the energy of the photon

211
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:49,646
after the scattering process.

212
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,727
So it's the rest energy of the electron
divided by <i>two minus cosine θ</i>.

213
00:12:56,018 --> 00:13:00,472
Let's look at the <i>θ</i> here
on the left column in degrees

214
00:13:00,472 --> 00:13:05,262
and here we have
the emitted energy of the photon,

215
00:13:05,262 --> 00:13:11,425
that's 510 kiloelectronvolts,
so if our photon is deviated by 20 degrees

216
00:13:11,425 --> 00:13:14,802
then the energy is reduced
by 30 kiloelectronvolts.

217
00:13:14,802 --> 00:13:18,779
If it is scattered by 45 degrees,
it is reduced

218
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:23,474
by 115 kiloelectronvolts.

219
00:13:24,385 --> 00:13:26,595
So, what's the principle
that we need to do now?

220
00:13:26,595 --> 00:13:31,958
The principle is we measured the energy
of the photons that we detect

221
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:37,617
and if the photon that we detect
does not have the energy

222
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:41,128
corresponding to 510 kiloelectronvolts,

223
00:13:41,128 --> 00:13:44,222
then we will conclude
this photon has been scattered

224
00:13:44,222 --> 00:13:47,204
and we will not count the event.

225
00:13:48,509 --> 00:13:53,818
Let's look at what we are seeing.
We have on the vertical axis the counts,

226
00:13:53,818 --> 00:13:57,863
on the horizontal axis,
the energy in kiloelectronvolts.

227
00:13:57,863 --> 00:14:02,566
This is the so-called LSO crystal.
We have the photo peak here,

228
00:14:02,566 --> 00:14:05,951
and the Compton backscatter.

229
00:14:06,348 --> 00:14:08,632
In this crystal, we could set
the energy window

230
00:14:08,632 --> 00:14:12,071
for 425 to 650 kiloelectronvolts

231
00:14:12,071 --> 00:14:16,577
and here the peak is the 510,
the annihilation photons that we detect.

232
00:14:17,452 --> 00:14:21,724
Anything else that we are seeing
is our photons that are being scattered

233
00:14:21,724 --> 00:14:23,984
that we can discard.

234
00:14:25,613 --> 00:14:28,679
Now, let's look
at a different crystal here in blue.

235
00:14:28,679 --> 00:14:32,132
That's the BGO crystal.
We've already mentioned that material.

236
00:14:32,132 --> 00:14:35,509
This crystal is not as good
in discriminating energy.

237
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,862
Its primary photo peak is broader,

238
00:14:37,862 --> 00:14:44,543
so the energy window here is now
from 350 to 650 kiloelectronvolts.

239
00:14:45,315 --> 00:14:48,631
It's a broader window
that is being detected

240
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:51,696
so the discrimination
of energies is not as good.

241
00:14:52,557 --> 00:14:54,838
The consequence is, we have to consider

242
00:14:54,838 --> 00:14:57,275
when we measure the photon energy

243
00:14:57,275 --> 00:14:59,584
that we don't have a ∆ distribution,

244
00:14:59,584 --> 00:15:02,948
a sharp definition of the photon energy
where we can detect.

245
00:15:02,948 --> 00:15:06,369
We have a certain imprecision
in the energy discrimination,

246
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,718
and so, if we look at the example of BGO,

247
00:15:09,718 --> 00:15:13,713
we only have 30 percent
energy discrimination here.

248
00:15:14,386 --> 00:15:19,885
If you look at something that we
want to be sure that we can distinguish,

249
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:22,797
let's say here we have roughly
half of the photon energy,

250
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:27,526
256 kiloelectronvolts, then this means
we are detecting photons

251
00:15:27,526 --> 00:15:30,344
that are scattered 
by 90 degrees or higher.

252
00:15:30,908 --> 00:15:35,438
The elimination
of scattered photons, photon pairs,

253
00:15:35,438 --> 00:15:42,060
where one photon has been scattered,
works well for severely scattered photons

254
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:46,271
here, typically
at least 60 to 90 degrees or higher,

255
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:49,058
being scattered by such an angle.

256
00:15:50,665 --> 00:15:55,354
Therefore, in order to have a better
elimination of the scattered photons,

257
00:15:55,354 --> 00:15:57,990
one needs other approaches.

258
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,143
One approach is to subtract
the background signal.

259
00:16:01,143 --> 00:16:04,907
This basically means
we measure the signal in--

260
00:16:04,907 --> 00:16:10,073
we look at the background in regions
where we know that there is no signal.

261
00:16:10,073 --> 00:16:14,285
Usually one has a good idea, especially
if one has simultaneously a CT scan

262
00:16:14,285 --> 00:16:19,005
and then interpolates the signal
in those regions with a polynomial,

263
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:21,153
and subtracts out that background.

264
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:24,851
To give you an idea why
we have signal in the background,

265
00:16:24,851 --> 00:16:28,779
here is an event
that's happening in the body.

266
00:16:28,779 --> 00:16:30,279
It's being Compton scattered,

267
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:33,211
and this will attribute a line
of incidences outside the body,

268
00:16:33,211 --> 00:16:35,746
so it will have intensity
that is outside the body.

269
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:40,098
Here, if we're doing a cardiac scan,
here are our two detectors,

270
00:16:40,098 --> 00:16:44,395
we could have radioactivity in the brain
that is severely scattered,

271
00:16:44,395 --> 00:16:47,421
that is scattered
and arises here in the detector

272
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:50,126
and that would not be good detection.

273
00:16:50,771 --> 00:16:54,608
What we're looking at here now
is a cut through an image,

274
00:16:54,608 --> 00:16:56,423
something like this.

275
00:16:56,423 --> 00:16:58,910
We have, obviously, two vials
or two objects here

276
00:16:58,910 --> 00:17:03,821
which are positron emitting.
We have the intensity going high here,

277
00:17:03,821 --> 00:17:07,376
but we can also see
where there is no signal.

278
00:17:07,376 --> 00:17:09,769
Where there is no object
there should be no signal,

279
00:17:09,769 --> 00:17:12,631
but we have not no signal here.
We have some signal here.

280
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:15,903
This is the background
due to randoms and scattered.

281
00:17:16,213 --> 00:17:19,150
It also takes into account random counts,

282
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:22,981
and all that is then needed
is to take a polynomial interpolation

283
00:17:22,981 --> 00:17:26,487
of this background and then
the signal here, this red line,

284
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:29,674
would be subtracted
from the image intensity

285
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:34,293
and that allows us
to eliminate the background signal

286
00:17:34,293 --> 00:17:37,396
due to scatter and random events.
