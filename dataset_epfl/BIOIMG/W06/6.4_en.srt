1
00:00:04,280 --> 00:00:07,570
Now, ideally, we would like
to have a scanner

2
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:11,010
that gives us an infinite
spatial resolution in theory,

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,490
and we would be happy
with such a technique.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,630
However, this is not the case in PET,

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:20,830
and the question here is,

6
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,860
why can the resolution be never perfect?

7
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:25,730
Well, let's look at the process here.

8
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,430
We have the positron that's being emitted
from the unstable parent nucleus.

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,790
The positron diffuses, loses energy,
and does the annihilation

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:36,430
with an electron
after a certain distance.

11
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:40,590
And this distance here is called
the mean free path length,

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,490
or the positron range.

13
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,220
And this range, there's nothing
we can do about it.

14
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,400
This range exists,
it is there, it is nonzero,

15
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,080
so the positron does not leave the nucleus

16
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:56,640
and immediately annihilate
with an electron; it takes some distance.

17
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,620
Let's give us some idea in the air,
if you have a positron emitter,

18
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,040
the positron range is actually
several meters, so it is quite long.

19
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,430
But if you look now in water--

20
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:13,030
and here I've plotted on this table
a number of isotopes.

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,410
We'll start out
with the most ubiquitously used,

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:18,320
fluorine-18, with its characteristics.

23
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,730
It has a half-life of roughly two hours.

24
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:26,710
The kinetic energy of the positron
is roughly 0.6 mega-electron volts,

25
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,530
and the range of the positron in water
is roughly a millimeter.

26
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,990
That's the full-width, half-maximum--

27
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,907
so, half of the positrons
will travel further than one millimeter.

28
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:43,860
If we look at C11, the half-life
is around 20 minutes,

29
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,070
the energy is higher,
it's one mega-electron volt,

30
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:51,280
and the range of the positron
emitted from the C11 nucleus

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,250
is a bit higher than that of the fluorine.

32
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:58,570
Oxygen-15, also a widely used tracer,

33
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:01,160
has a surprisingly short half-life
of two minutes.

34
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,600
Positron energy
of nearly two mega-electron volts,

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:12,110
and here, the range of the positron
in water is 1.5 millimeters.

36
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:15,690
Then we have nitrogen-13;
10 minutes half-life.

37
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:19,410
Gallium-68 which can produce 
a half-life of 70 minutes,

38
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:21,440
and Rubidium, of one minute.

39
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,040
Voltages between 1.2
and 3 mega-electron volts,

40
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,050
and, again, the range of the positron
in water is around 1.5 millimeters.

41
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:36,380
So, these distances,
we cannot manipulate them,

42
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:41,640
we cannot improve them, they are there,
they are a given, and...

43
00:02:42,630 --> 00:02:47,070
We have to deal with this imprecision.

44
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,250
This basically means
that even if we're able

45
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,250
to determine precisely the location
of a positron and electron annihilation,

46
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,590
this does,
by one millimeter distance roughly,

47
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:00,670
<i>not</i> represent the location
of the parent nucleus.

48
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,520
So, here are the most frequently
used isotopes:

49
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,230
fluorine-18, C11 and oxygen-15.

50
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:16,130
Now, there is another effect, and that is
we have assumed collinearity

51
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:20,250
of the photon pair for the reconstruction.

52
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,470
So, the background of this
is that we have assumed

53
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:26,310
that at the time of annihilation,
the electron-positron pair

54
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:29,820
has zero kinetic energy.

55
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:35,289
Now, in reality, they will not have 
zero kinetic energy,

56
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:38,930
and we have conservation
of momentum to consider.

57
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:43,670
So, let's have the nucleus here.
We have the positron.

58
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:49,560
It finds the electron, annihilates,
and goes up in perfect 180 degrees.

59
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:54,540
This is the situation where the positron
and the electron together

60
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,380
have zero kinetic energy.

61
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:01,370
In this case, the two photons
will be perfectly 180 degrees apart,

62
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:06,500
and we have zero momentum

63
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,840
of, also, the photon pair.

64
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,250
Now, let's consider a situation

65
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:16,560
where the positron and the electron
have nonzero linear momentum.

66
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,949
So, the positron and the electron,
their linear momentum is nonzero,

67
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:25,650
that's indicated by the arrow here,
so this is a resulting linear momentum.

68
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,930
Now, the process of annihilation
conserves linear momentum,

69
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:33,930
so the photons, the two photons,
should have nonzero linear momentum.

70
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,160
To achieve this, we have to imply

71
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:40,780
that the two photons
are not emitted 180 degrees apart,

72
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:45,520
but are deviated by a small angle
from this collinearity.

73
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:49,380
So, we have the two
510 kilo-electron volt photons.

74
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,690
They are not perfectly 
opposed to each other,

75
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:59,240
because their net linear momentum
is nonzero.

76
00:04:59,830 --> 00:05:03,220
So, this will now give us
a line of incidence that's different.

77
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,260
We will detect the photon
at a different place

78
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:12,870
than where the positron-electron
annihilation has happened.

79
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,200
This angle is very small.
It's 0.25 degrees, roughly,

80
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:21,010
so we can estimate from that
the error in location.

81
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,690
So, we'll take the distance <i>Δx</i> here,

82
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,350
we'll say we have a detector distance
between the two detectors of <i>D</i>,

83
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,030
and so we can calculate with this.

84
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:39,510
We can calculate the deviation
of where we detect the photon pair

85
00:05:39,510 --> 00:05:44,790
relative to the true location, is 0.5 D,
times tangent of 0.25 degrees.

86
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,070
So, what does this mean?

87
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:52,930
We'll plot here, just as a function of <i>D</i>,
the position error we have

88
00:05:52,930 --> 00:05:56,080
if the two detectors
are 60 centimeter apart,

89
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:02,440
then with a 0.25 degree angle,
we have an error of one millimeter--

90
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,280
80 centimeters,
it's nearly two millimeters,

91
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,390
and 100 centimeters,
it's a bit above two millimeters.

92
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:11,630
This gives you an idea
of the location error.

93
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:16,760
Now, we're assuming
collinearity of the photons,

94
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,030
so they're opposed to each other, outside.

95
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,640
If they are not, then we have deviations,

96
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:28,580
from 60 centimeters to one meter,
of roughly 1.5 millimeters.

97
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:32,620
So, this deviation can happen
in all directions,

98
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:35,940
so this basically just means
that we have a blurring

99
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,370
of the representation of the position--

100
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,470
of where the electron
and the positron annihilated.

101
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:45,490
This adds on top of the range
of the positron.

102
00:06:45,490 --> 00:06:48,490
<i>We already have here
the range of the positron.</i>

103
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,200
That gives us an uncertainty, and then,
if we have a large detector distance,

104
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,190
we have also an uncertainty
in determining the location

105
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,630
of where the positron
and electron annihilated.

106
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:04,920
Now, we have said
that the detection of x-rays

107
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,520
for positron emission tomography,
the methodology that's used--

108
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,360
that is, scintillation followed
by amplification by photomultiplier tubes,

109
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,340
is the same as for SPECT.

110
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:17,040
And as you might remember,

111
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:20,560
the photomultiplier tubes
have a certain dimension.

112
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:24,470
The scintillation crystal
has to have a certain thickness,

113
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,060
and this is the question:
how does the choice of the detector

114
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:34,830
affect the spatial resolution
of the positron emission tomography scan?

115
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,930
So, let's take as an example
a BGO block detector.

116
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:41,440
I'm bringing here this example

117
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,450
to also put some numbers
on the characteristics.

118
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:50,350
The coincidence window that you can choose
with a BGO block detector

119
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,890
is on the order of 10 nanoseconds.

120
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,050
The energy resolution is roughly 25%,

121
00:07:56,380 --> 00:08:00,380
so this is to give you
some specific numbers.

122
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,270
Now, we will look
at the true incidence count rate--

123
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:08,250
we'll call that R true, <i>R_T</i> for true--

124
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,550
is given by two times
the tissue radioactivity,

125
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:17,552
times the factor...
C_T * is the tissue activity of a voxel.

126
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,100
We have <i>ε</i>
is the intrinsic detector efficiency.

127
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,970
It actually represents the ability
of the scintillation crystal

128
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:32,900
to stop the x-ray,
the 510 kilo-electron volt photon,

129
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,240
and to simplify it, it basically means
here the ability to stop them.

130
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,390
So, it's given by <i>1 - e</i> to the <i>- μ x</i>.

131
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:44,620
The <i>μ</i>, the linear attenuation
coefficient here,

132
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,840
is that of the scintillation crystal.

133
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:50,720
So, ideally, we would have
a fairly thick crystal--x being high--

134
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,530
linear attenuation coefficient being high,

135
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:56,440
in this case the efficiency
would be close to one.

136
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:02,240
So, here's an example
of a scintillation crystal,

137
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,700
and the photomultiplier tubes on top.

138
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,880
We'll look here
at a more modern detector.

139
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:12,140
We have the photomultiplier tubes here,

140
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:15,920
here's the electronics,
here's the scintillation crystal,

141
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,570
and the scintillation crystal
has a certain thickness here.

142
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,100
We have to consider also
the geometric efficiency--

143
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,790
that is, what percentage
of the solid angle

144
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,740
do we see by the detector?

145
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:32,680
So, the detector surface here, in green,

146
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:39,670
divided by <i>4 π</i>, the radius squared,
this gives us the percentage

147
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:44,150
of all the counts, all the x-rays,
that we can detect.

148
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,330
Think of it this way, all the x-ray pairs
going all directions,

149
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,890
we have a detector up here.

150
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,040
This detector will only see
a small percentage

151
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,530
of the entire spherical surface
at its location,

152
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:58,470
and these are the maximum counts
that you can have,

153
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,330
it's geometric efficiency.

154
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:06,330
So, to give you an idea, if you look
at the intrinsic detector efficiency,

155
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,470
if we have the detector efficiency
of this detector here,

156
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:14,490
let's say, is 90%,
since we are detecting a photon pair,

157
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:17,620
we have to also consider
the detector efficiency on the other side.

158
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:20,810
So, if each detector
has an efficiency of 90%,

159
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:23,490
then we have 81% of the photon pairs

160
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,170
that are emitted towards the detectors,
that produce coincidence.

161
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,020
And so, this is a reason why
we cannot use infinitely thin crystals.

162
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,060
We have to use them fairly thick,

163
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,620
and a typical dimension here
is three centimeters.

164
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:45,760
So, if we look now at our detector ring,
here, see, crystal thickness,

165
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,590
we will now look at the detector ring,

166
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,600
and we are considering
these two detectors here,

167
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,880
just opposite of each other.

168
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:58,680
This is the line of incidence
that's defined by the two crystals,

169
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:02,060
and if we have an annihilation event here,

170
00:11:02,790 --> 00:11:08,560
then we will attribute all the events here
on this line of incidence.

171
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,560
This is the good situation,
we have good resolution,

172
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,500
with the detector width here,

173
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:17,320
the position measured here and here
that defines the line of incidence.

174
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:21,550
Now, let's consider two detectors
a little bit offset,

175
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,620
that are not just opposite each other.

176
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:27,070
We have an event detected in this crystal,

177
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:29,080
and we have an event
detected in this crystal.

178
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,600
So, what does this mean now?

179
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,730
Basically, it means
we can have detected an event

180
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:38,120
anywhere in this shaded area.

181
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,830
This will create--
any even that is in here,

182
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:46,340
or any event that's detected
here in this crystal or this crystal,

183
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:50,270
could have had the annihilation
between an electron and a positron

184
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,770
anywhere in this gray area.

185
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,390
So, as you can see now,

186
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,090
as we are getting away
from the center of the scanner,

187
00:11:59,090 --> 00:12:04,280
the resolution is poorer,
because of this geometrical consideration.

188
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:07,350
So, the take-home message here is,

189
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,610
of a standard PET scanner
with this technology,

190
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:15,360
the resolution is best
at the center of the scanner.
