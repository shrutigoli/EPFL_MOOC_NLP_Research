1
00:00:04,228 --> 00:00:06,900
We have, in a previous section,
mentioned that the events

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,721
that we are detecting are trues, randoms,
and scattered events.

3
00:00:11,721 --> 00:00:16,591
And for trues, we have to apply
attenuation correction.

4
00:00:16,594 --> 00:00:18,690
So, let's assume we have a situation
where we've dealt

5
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,894
with the scattered events, we've dealt
with the random events--

6
00:00:21,894 --> 00:00:26,128
but still, for the two coincidences,
we have to consider the fact

7
00:00:26,128 --> 00:00:29,617
that they are not detected

8
00:00:31,267 --> 00:00:33,267
at 100% because some of them

9
00:00:33,267 --> 00:00:36,345
are being absorbed in the body.

10
00:00:36,345 --> 00:00:39,011
So, let's look at the situation, here,
schematically.

11
00:00:39,011 --> 00:00:42,571
We have our subject, here, 
the patient, as an oval.

12
00:00:42,571 --> 00:00:47,854
We have a generation 
of an annihilation photon pair, here,

13
00:00:47,854 --> 00:00:49,360
at this point.

14
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,430
We'll consider the direction
of the photons.

15
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:55,401
One photon travels a distance <i>x</i>
through the body,

16
00:00:55,401 --> 00:00:58,567
and the other photon travels
a distance d minus x.

17
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:02,193
So, the total path that the photon pair
travels through the body

18
00:01:02,193 --> 00:01:05,601
is the length is given by <i>d</i>.

19
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:08,736
We'll now say, at this point,
we have a tissue radioactivity

20
00:01:08,736 --> 00:01:12,836
of <i>C</i> for tissue radioactivity,
<i>T</i> for tissue, star to indicate

21
00:01:12,836 --> 00:01:17,091
x-ray activity, as a function
of position <i>x</i>, here.

22
00:01:17,091 --> 00:01:19,152
So <i>x</i> is our variable.

23
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:22,002
Now, what is the probability
that the signal arises

24
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:26,613
in detector-- arise in detector 1?

25
00:01:26,613 --> 00:01:29,328
The probability is given by the signal
that we detect,

26
00:01:29,328 --> 00:01:34,167
divided by the tissue radioactivity,
plus a few corrections,

27
00:01:34,167 --> 00:01:36,520
but for all the photons that go in
this direction,

28
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:37,872
we're only considering those,

29
00:01:37,872 --> 00:01:43,393
only those that go in this direction--
the photons that we detect

30
00:01:43,393 --> 00:01:48,118
is given by the tissue radioactivity
times the attenuation.

31
00:01:48,118 --> 00:01:50,356
That's the signal that we get,
so, the probability

32
00:01:50,356 --> 00:01:54,566
of detecting the signal is equals
to <i>e</i> to the minus mu

33
00:01:54,566 --> 00:01:57,180
times distance traveled.

34
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:59,239
The same thing applies here 
for this position--

35
00:01:59,239 --> 00:02:03,980
for this detector, the probability
is given by <i>e</i> to the minus [mu x]--

36
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:09,096
<i>x</i> being the distance from this place
to the edge of the tissue.

37
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:11,211
Same consideration.

38
00:02:11,211 --> 00:02:16,351
So, if we now look at the attenuation,
how do we calculate the attenuation?

39
00:02:16,351 --> 00:02:19,156
The attenuation is essentially
the probability that we see

40
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:21,086
the photon pair.

41
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:25,857
So, let's assume that half of the photons
that go in to the direction

42
00:02:25,857 --> 00:02:29,469
of detector 1 are being eliminated.

43
00:02:29,469 --> 00:02:34,969
So, we only see half of the annihilation
photon pairs of the coincidence events.

44
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:39,680
Now, let's assume in the other direction,
we also only see half of the photons.

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,773
So, for those photons that arrive here
at detector 1, those half out of 150,

46
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:48,973
the other photon, half of them
are being eliminated.

47
00:02:48,973 --> 00:02:53,962
So, in the result-- in the end result,
we have only 25 photons that we count,

48
00:02:53,962 --> 00:02:56,352
if the total is a hundred.

49
00:02:56,352 --> 00:03:00,591
So, only 50 arrive in detector 1,
so, we can only have

50
00:03:00,591 --> 00:03:02,626
50 simultaneous events.

51
00:03:02,626 --> 00:03:05,016
And of the 50, half of them 
are being absorbed here.

52
00:03:05,016 --> 00:03:08,215
So, we end up with 25.

53
00:03:08,215 --> 00:03:12,452
Or, in other words, the probability
of detecting the photon pair

54
00:03:12,452 --> 00:03:15,506
is given by the multiplication
of the two probablities

55
00:03:15,506 --> 00:03:19,947
of detecting each of the photons.

56
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:23,950
So, this is the probability is equals
to <i>e</i> to the minus [mu x],

57
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:27,703
times <i>e</i> to the minus mu <i>d</i> minus <i>x</i>.

58
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:32,013
And so, we can simplify that--
we have the signal now--

59
00:03:32,013 --> 00:03:36,922
is the probability of the photon pair
times the tissue radioactivity.

60
00:03:36,922 --> 00:03:39,602
And so, this gives rise to an attenuation.

61
00:03:39,602 --> 00:03:42,052
We have the signal is equals 
to the tissue radioactivity

62
00:03:42,052 --> 00:03:45,438
at this position, times <i>e</i>
to the minus [mu d].

63
00:03:45,438 --> 00:03:47,364
If you take this term here,
you'll see, rapidly,

64
00:03:47,364 --> 00:03:50,510
that this is equals to minus [mu d].

65
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:55,798
And this is quite similar
to this correction--

66
00:03:55,798 --> 00:03:58,531
to the geometric average
that I introduced last week

67
00:03:58,531 --> 00:04:02,232
for SPECT scanning in lesson 5.

68
00:04:02,232 --> 00:04:06,138
So, what this means is essentially,
for doing the attenuation,

69
00:04:06,138 --> 00:04:08,968
estimating the attenuation, 
we just need to know

70
00:04:08,968 --> 00:04:13,368
the dimension of the object
along our Radon transform,

71
00:04:13,368 --> 00:04:18,221
along our orientation, and from that,
we can calculate the attenuation.

72
00:04:18,221 --> 00:04:22,110
Be aware that here, in this situation,
we have assumed uniform attenuation--

73
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:26,395
in reality, situation is slightly 
more complicated.

74
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:31,379
Here is an uncorrected PET scan
of a subject.

75
00:04:31,379 --> 00:04:33,089
Here is the cut through the torso.

76
00:04:33,089 --> 00:04:37,569
We can see the nose here,
the spine-- and here's the coronal,

77
00:04:37,569 --> 00:04:39,756
here we have the bladder,
here we have the brain,

78
00:04:39,756 --> 00:04:41,488
the arms are up here.

79
00:04:41,488 --> 00:04:45,127
This is the uncorrected scan,
and here is the scan corrected.

80
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:49,016
And you can see, certainly, if we correct
for the attenuation--

81
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:52,078
if you take the sinogram and correct it
for attenuation, the image

82
00:04:52,078 --> 00:04:56,492
is much more crisper and clear
in allowing us to discern the uptake

83
00:04:56,492 --> 00:04:58,094
of the radio tracer.

84
00:04:58,094 --> 00:05:04,091
So, attenuation correction is important
in producing a faithful representation

85
00:05:04,091 --> 00:05:07,967
of tissue radioactivity in the body.

86
00:05:09,216 --> 00:05:13,382
So, what are the steps
in attenuation correction

87
00:05:13,382 --> 00:05:16,024
that we need to do for PET?

88
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:20,431
Let's look at the mass attenuation
coefficient in soft tissue--

89
00:05:20,431 --> 00:05:23,217
this is roughly 0.1 centimeters
squared per gram,

90
00:05:23,217 --> 00:05:26,470
for the 510 kiloelectron volt photons.

91
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,476
Now, does this give us an intuitive feel
for what this means?

92
00:05:33,476 --> 00:05:37,191
It's quantitatively important-- 
we'd have to do some calculation.

93
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:43,615
So, the more easier way to assess this
is to look at the half value layer

94
00:05:43,615 --> 00:05:47,208
of these photons in soft tissue.

95
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,578
The half value layer,
as you might remember,

96
00:05:49,578 --> 00:05:53,938
is 0.7 divided by mu--
the linear attenuation coefficient--

97
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:58,485
and so, it turns out that for photons
in soft tissue, the half value layer

98
00:05:58,485 --> 00:06:01,981
is roughly 7 centimeters.

99
00:06:01,981 --> 00:06:05,472
So, that is not a very long distance.

100
00:06:05,472 --> 00:06:10,294
We have to consider that the entire path
of the photon pair through the tissue

101
00:06:13,114 --> 00:06:15,816
is taken into consideration--
it's the distance <i>d</i>

102
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:18,007
that we had on the previous slide.

103
00:06:18,007 --> 00:06:21,489
So, it is longer than for a single photon.

104
00:06:21,489 --> 00:06:26,818
But, we also have to consider
that the lines of response,

105
00:06:26,818 --> 00:06:30,680
lines of incidence, have different
attenuations,

106
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,201
depending on how big we are.

107
00:06:33,201 --> 00:06:36,941
If we were perfectly cylindrical objects--
if we were imaging

108
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:40,432
perfectly cylindrical objects,
it wouldn't matter as much.

109
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:43,768
So, what are we doing in practice?

110
00:06:43,768 --> 00:06:48,154
For this example, I'll assume
my spatial uniform attenuation coefficient

111
00:06:48,154 --> 00:06:53,155
and my subject here, that is oval,
and one uses, for example,

112
00:06:53,155 --> 00:06:56,410
can use a cesium source
in this illustration--

113
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:01,329
the cesium source has a photon energy

114
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:04,579
of 660 kiloelectron volts.

115
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:07,895
Now, why is this good enough
for estimating the attenuation

116
00:07:07,895 --> 00:07:10,454
in 510 kiloelectron volts?

117
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:17,490
Remember this: we have, at these energies,
we have the Compton effect

118
00:07:17,490 --> 00:07:21,269
that dominates, and linear attenuation
coefficient for Compton

119
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:24,039
is essentially proportional 
to the electron density,

120
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,671
and varies very slowly 
with the photon energy

121
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:28,914
at these high energies.

122
00:07:28,914 --> 00:07:33,645
So, it is a good approximation
of what is going on.

123
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:37,488
So, we just take the source,
we rotate it, and we have the detector

124
00:07:37,488 --> 00:07:43,340
on the opposite side, and we will measure
the intensity as a function

125
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,400
of the angle phi-- we have seen 
the thing rotate.

126
00:07:48,014 --> 00:07:50,492
Now this is not good enough.

127
00:07:50,492 --> 00:07:53,564
We have to compare that to the blank scan.

128
00:07:53,564 --> 00:07:56,293
And the blank scan means
we will remove the subject.

129
00:07:56,293 --> 00:07:57,984
So, here's the subject removed.

130
00:07:57,984 --> 00:08:01,163
We will repeat the same scan,
so we measure the intensity

131
00:08:01,163 --> 00:08:04,857
of the source as it is being detected.

132
00:08:04,857 --> 00:08:07,778
And then we divide the two intensities,
and what we are obtaining

133
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:12,639
is <i>e</i> to the minus [mu d],
and <i>d</i> here, this is important,

134
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,207
is a function of the projection angle
that we have--

135
00:08:17,207 --> 00:08:21,310
so as we rotate around
the foreign object,

136
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,015
that is, for example, elliptical,
we have different attenuations

137
00:08:25,015 --> 00:08:26,610
to consider.

138
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:32,419
So, this basically means, we will produce
a correction for each Radon transform,

139
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:34,139
for each orientation.

140
00:08:35,199 --> 00:08:37,629
This example that you have here
on the screen,

141
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:41,561
is for a homogeneous linear attenuation
coefficient, here--

142
00:08:41,561 --> 00:08:42,882
mu doesn't vary.

143
00:08:42,882 --> 00:08:46,398
For situations that are more complex,
as in real life, we would, actually,

144
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:52,057
have to integrate the linear attenuation
coefficient along the perpendicular

145
00:08:52,057 --> 00:08:56,447
to the projection-- and this is nothing
but the measurement of a--

146
00:08:57,177 --> 00:09:00,951
the expression that we have for a CT scan.

147
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:03,965
So, if you look at the PET imaging
of the body-- let's look here

148
00:09:03,965 --> 00:09:07,182
at this subject that's in a PET scanner.

149
00:09:07,182 --> 00:09:12,228
And I want you to think a little bit,
here, what is being scanned here.

150
00:09:12,228 --> 00:09:13,823
What organ?

151
00:09:15,518 --> 00:09:19,368
Well, it's not the head.
The head is outside the scanner.

152
00:09:19,368 --> 00:09:22,628
We are outside-- the detector ring
is here, so, it's not the head.

153
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:27,396
It's not the prostate, 
or the lower abdomen.

154
00:09:27,396 --> 00:09:30,633
It is actually at the level of the heart.
It's a heart scan.

155
00:09:30,633 --> 00:09:35,743
So, second question: why is the subject
putting his arms behind the head?

156
00:09:35,743 --> 00:09:40,337
Because they like to be relaxed,
or because they were being told so?

157
00:09:40,982 --> 00:09:42,401
Well, look on the left.

158
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:47,071
The half value layer for positron photons
is 7 centimeters.

159
00:09:47,071 --> 00:09:50,699
This means, if you take an average
thick arm, like mine here,

160
00:09:51,569 --> 00:09:54,393
Roughly, let's say, it's 7 centimeters.

161
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:55,661
And I put it on the side.

162
00:09:55,661 --> 00:09:58,787
And I measure the Radon transform
in this direction the projection.

163
00:09:58,787 --> 00:10:03,467
Putting my arms down means 
that I increase the average path length

164
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:05,017
by 14 centimeters.

165
00:10:05,017 --> 00:10:09,808
That is, I only detect 25% of the photons.

166
00:10:09,808 --> 00:10:14,274
So, for a heart scan, I will measure,
in this direction,

167
00:10:14,274 --> 00:10:17,564
a substantially reduced intensity.

168
00:10:18,624 --> 00:10:21,457
So, if we have the arms along the side
for a cardiac scan,

169
00:10:21,457 --> 00:10:24,486
we have a lot of attenuation,
because we have the additional attenuation

170
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:26,645
of the arms to consider.

171
00:10:26,645 --> 00:10:29,530
And so, for a heart scan, 
we put the arms up,

172
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:33,894
and we scan around here,
and so the arms don't enter into play.

173
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:37,245
Conversely, if we do a brain scan,
we're not going to put the arms here,

174
00:10:37,245 --> 00:10:40,842
because that-- we will introduce, again,
for a substantial fraction

175
00:10:40,842 --> 00:10:46,426
of the projections that we measure,
we will lose substantial intensity,

176
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:47,757
and that is not good.

177
00:10:47,757 --> 00:10:51,718
We want to have the best intensity,
so, we do not expose our subject

178
00:10:51,718 --> 00:10:55,418
to a higher radiation dose than necessary.

179
00:10:56,888 --> 00:11:00,598
I mentioned early on that the PET/CT
scanner is the industry standard.

180
00:11:00,598 --> 00:11:03,454
You can no longer buy a PET scanner
that is standalone.

181
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:06,239
You buy them together with a CT scanner.

182
00:11:06,239 --> 00:11:09,226
We have, on the previous slides,
seen that the attenuation correction

183
00:11:09,226 --> 00:11:14,658
uses expressions, or measurements,
that are akin to what is being done

184
00:11:14,658 --> 00:11:16,884
in a CT scanner.

185
00:11:16,884 --> 00:11:20,975
And so, I want to explain here
how this can be done.

186
00:11:20,975 --> 00:11:25,976
We have plotted here the mass attenuation
coefficient on the vertical axis, here,

187
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:29,490
versus the photon energy 
on the horizontal axis.

188
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:33,466
And this is roughly the change
in linear attenuation,

189
00:11:33,466 --> 00:11:36,137
or mass attenuation coefficient
for soft tissue.

190
00:11:36,137 --> 00:11:39,939
And in red and in green, 
we have the same for bone.

191
00:11:41,195 --> 00:11:43,788
The photon energies that are used
for CT scanning

192
00:11:43,788 --> 00:11:46,657
are typically between 30 
to 40 kiloelectron volts,

193
00:11:46,657 --> 00:11:49,266
to 120 kiloelectron volts.

194
00:11:50,449 --> 00:11:54,905
And so we obtain-- at these energies-- 
we obtain a CT scan of the body,

195
00:11:54,905 --> 00:11:56,970
which is depicted here.

196
00:11:57,784 --> 00:12:01,174
So, this is roughly a scan at roughly
70 kiloelectron volts

197
00:12:01,174 --> 00:12:03,523
that's been done here.

198
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:06,860
Now, what one can do is, 
given that we can easily identify

199
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:12,581
bone in a CT scan and soft tissue,
we can extrapolate what the image

200
00:12:12,581 --> 00:12:15,015
would look like, and we get, then,

201
00:12:15,015 --> 00:12:19,145
the CT scan at a supposed photon energy

202
00:12:19,145 --> 00:12:21,101
for 510 kiloelectron volts.

203
00:12:21,101 --> 00:12:23,919
So, this is done by extrapolation.

204
00:12:24,846 --> 00:12:27,463
A bit more sophisticated-- 
here's a CT scan--

205
00:12:27,463 --> 00:12:32,108
you can see the lungs, in white,
no attenuation--

206
00:12:32,108 --> 00:12:34,194
You see the head, here,
you see the rib cage,

207
00:12:34,194 --> 00:12:36,158
a lot of attenuation.

208
00:12:36,158 --> 00:12:39,814
And, now, based on the absorption,
since the bones have a lot of electrons,

209
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:43,596
they have a lot of calcium--
we can actually identify the areas--

210
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,591
calcium rich areas.

211
00:12:45,591 --> 00:12:49,976
This is the-- such segmented image

212
00:12:49,976 --> 00:12:52,976
for bone, and for soft tissue.

213
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:56,661
And since we have, in green,
the extrapolation

214
00:12:56,661 --> 00:13:01,330
of the mass attenuation coefficient,
and in red, the mass attenuation

215
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:05,233
coefficient for soft tissue--
we have these two images.

216
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:11,903
One can calculate a synthetic image,
taking into account the effect of--

217
00:13:11,903 --> 00:13:15,813
the slightly differential effect of bone,
and this gives us, now, the distribution

218
00:13:15,813 --> 00:13:20,197
of the linear attenuation coefficient
at 510 kiloelectron volts.

219
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:24,474
So, this measured at low energy,
based on-- segmented into bone

220
00:13:24,474 --> 00:13:28,460
and soft tissue we composed
with a-- the measured mass attenuation

221
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:32,876
coefficient for 510 kiloelectron volts.

222
00:13:35,009 --> 00:13:39,721
And this, in the end, will give us
the justification for combining, here,

223
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:44,649
a CT scan with a PET scan-- 
so this is a CT scan of the abdomen,

224
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:50,065
here's the heart, black is the lungs.
We have the PET scan of the same area

225
00:13:50,514 --> 00:13:54,584
in grayscale, and now for the fusion
of the two images, the PET scan

226
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:59,202
is color coded, it's lower resolution 
than a CT scan, super imposed

227
00:13:59,202 --> 00:14:02,468
on the high resolution CT scan,
and now we can easily see

228
00:14:02,468 --> 00:14:07,322
with the warm colors delineating
high activity in the tissue

229
00:14:07,322 --> 00:14:12,645
where the high activity
of the PET tracer uptake is.

230
00:14:14,844 --> 00:14:19,611
So, PET/CT is actually not one modality,
although, in theory, one can think

231
00:14:19,611 --> 00:14:24,011
of doing it this way-- it is actually,
in reality, two scanners.

232
00:14:24,554 --> 00:14:28,961
We have up front, the patient first sees
the CT scanner, and behind it,

233
00:14:28,961 --> 00:14:32,331
the PET scanner, and they're put
into a single package

234
00:14:32,331 --> 00:14:34,208
with a nice little cover.

235
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:37,131
So, we have the patient bed,
we'll put the subject on here,

236
00:14:37,131 --> 00:14:41,234
and the subject first undergoes,
for a few seconds, a CT scan.

237
00:14:41,234 --> 00:14:45,131
Once that is done, the patient table
is moved forward,

238
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:50,104
and then we take another ten minutes
for the PET scan to measure the uptake

239
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:54,530
of the positron emitter in the body
of this subject.

240
00:14:54,930 --> 00:14:58,852
So, it is PET/CT-- two scanners 
in one package

241
00:15:00,462 --> 00:15:03,745
that puts the two techniques together.
