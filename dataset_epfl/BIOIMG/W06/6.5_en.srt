1
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:08,020
So, in this section, we want to discuss
some applications,

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:10,610
primarily oncology and neuroscience,

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:13,890
of the positron emission tomography,

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:18,380
but first, I want to start out
with typical PET tracers.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:22,110
At the end of this section,
I'll give a brief overview

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:25,970
of the x-ray imaging techniques
that we're treating in this course.

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:30,620
<i>So, let's look at cancer.</i>

8
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:35,530
<i>We have a tracer
that's fluoroethyltyrosine, fluorinating.</i>

9
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:39,120
<i>It is used as a marker
of amino acid transport.</i>

10
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,160
<i>We have deoxyfluorothymidine,</i>

11
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,530
<i>which is used as a marker
of proliferation, that is, cell growth.</i>

12
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,910
<i>We have fluoromisonidazole,
FMISO, a tracer for hypoxia.</i>

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,950
<i>Then we have C11-methionine,</i>

14
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:58,370
<i>that is amino acid
transport and metabolism,</i>

15
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:02,640
<i>and oxygen-15, for blood flow,</i>

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,880
<i>and finally, fluorodeoxyglucose
for glucose metabolism.</i>

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,370
<i>So these are some of the tracers
that are used in oncology.</i>

18
00:01:13,370 --> 00:01:17,020
<i>Here's a comparison of two scans.
We have FDG.</i>

19
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,490
<i>On the left, the brain has high uptake.</i>

20
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:24,260
<i>We have the bladder here, and here is FLT
fluorothymidine proliferation.</i>

21
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,080
<i>We see some spots here,</i>

22
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:32,980
<i>so they clearly trace
different mechanisms in the body.</i>

23
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:37,700
<i>Here is the fluorothymidine molecule,
fluorine is here,</i>

24
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,880
<i>and the fluorodeoxyglucose,
the fluorine is here.</i>

25
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:45,310
<i>Some of the tracers
are also used in neuroscience,</i>

26
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:47,860
<i>so brain research or brain applications.</i>

27
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:51,580
<i>These are are methionine, water,
and fluorodeoxyglucose.</i>

28
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:54,820
<i>We also have fluorodopa,</i>

29
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:58,310
<i>that's obviously for pre-synaptic
dopaminergic function.</i>

30
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,130
<i>We have O15-butanol,
as a blood flow marker.</i>

31
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,600
<i>We have flumazenil,
for benzodiazepine receptor mapping.</i>

32
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:12,290
<i>This is C11, and here are now
some examples of the brain.</i>

33
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:15,820
<i>This is the NFDG scan, fluorodeoxyglucose,</i>

34
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:19,590
<i>and here we have an O15 water scan.</i>

35
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,750
<i>We can see
that the resolution is quite better</i>

36
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:25,020
<i>with the FDG scan than with the O15 water,</i>

37
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:30,560
<i>and the reason is-- part of the reason
has to do with the fact</i>

38
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,530
<i>that the mean free path length,</i>

39
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:39,310
<i>or the positron range
of oxygen-15 positrons,</i>

40
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:43,950
<i>is longer than those
of the fluorine positrons.</i>

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:47,800
Now, some examples from neuroscience.

42
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,560
If we take the color-coded
raw image of the brain here,

43
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:58,130
this is what it looks like,
and then typically it's pseudo-colored,

44
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:02,220
so we have the red and yellow
provides high activity;

45
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,260
green, blue, low activity.

46
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,920
In a normal subject, here,
the uptake would look like this.

47
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,430
This is deoxyglucose,
it's glucose metabolism in the brain,

48
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:13,810
and here, in a patient with Alzheimer's,

49
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,850
one can see that in the back of the head,

50
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,610
there is reduced glucose metabolism,

51
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:24,010
consistent with the degeneration
of the nervous system.

52
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:28,110
<i>Until the early '90s,
positron emission tomography</i>

53
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,530
<i>was pretty much-- not the only,
but it was the major technique</i>

54
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:33,520
<i>by which one was able to look</i>

55
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,400
<i>at how the brain responds
to certain mental tasks.</i>

56
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,670
<i>So, what is done here
is measuring the uptake of glucose,</i>

57
00:03:41,670 --> 00:03:47,310
<i>when you look, listen, think, remember
or use your working memory,</i>

58
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,400
<i>and you can clearly see
the uptake of the glucose is different</i>

59
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:54,780
<i>in the different brain regions,
depending on the task.</i>

60
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:59,710
<i>This has-- since the early '90s,
has been replaced by functional MRI,</i>

61
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:02,750
<i>which we will discuss
as part of the MRI techniques</i>

62
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,940
<i>in the second part of this course.</i>

63
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,450
<i>Here's an example of a rodent brain.</i>

64
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:12,620
<i>We have the rodent brain; at the front,
we have the olfactory bulb,</i>

65
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,710
<i>so this is cut through the olfactory bulb.</i>

66
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:18,200
<i>We have the cerebellum
and the cerebrum here,</i>

67
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,700
<i>and one particular feature of rodents
is the Harderian glands,</i>

68
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,170
<i>which take up glucose very highly,</i>

69
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,240
<i>and they produce an uptake
that's very strong.</i>

70
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:31,010
<i>They're not part of the brain,
but they have a strong uptake.</i>

71
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,556
<i>Here's an example</i>

72
00:04:33,556 --> 00:04:39,860
<i>of a measurement
of metabolism using PET,</i>

73
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:41,920
<i>and this is an animal model</i>

74
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:45,290
<i>of administration of cocaine--
self-administration.</i>

75
00:04:45,290 --> 00:04:51,390
<i>These are some examples
of PET in neuroscience.</i>

76
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:55,160
Now, here I want to take
a clinical example,

77
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:57,560
and this is a stomach carcinoma.

78
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,710
We have the CT scan here,
before chemotherapy treatment.

79
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:06,510
The arrows delineate
where the lesion is-- the tumor is,

80
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,300
and the PET scan
gives us here a high uptake

81
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,409
indicative of neoplastic cancerous tissue.

82
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:20,930
The subject is then subjected
to chemotherapy, and on day 14,

83
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:25,170
the subject here
is measured again with PET,

84
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:28,530
and this high-uptake region is gone.

85
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,580
<i>So, in this study, one has classified
the subject as a responder,</i>

86
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,830
<i>and what one finds
three months after the chemotherapy--</i>

87
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,450
<i>that the lesion is gone
and the treatment was successful.</i>

88
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:45,640
<i>Conversely, here we have another subject,
again, with a stomach carcinoma.</i>

89
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:49,670
<i>High uptake of deoxyglucose,</i>

90
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:54,360
<i>and 14 days after the therapy started,
the uptake is still there.</i>

91
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:58,270
<i>Prediction was
that this subject is a non-responder,</i>

92
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,690
<i>and indeed, the carcinoma
has stayed in place</i>

93
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:04,640
<i>and not responded to the therapy.</i>

94
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:08,300
<i>Now, ideally, this is--
and I like this example a lot,</i>

95
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,820
<i>because it illustrates one of the hopes
and dreams of biomedical imaging.</i>

96
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:16,840
<i>Chemotherapy, as you may know,
is not a nice treatment.</i>

97
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,580
<i>It has a lot of side effects
and it is very unpleasant.</i>

98
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:23,200
<i>Ideally, we don't want
to a few months later find out</i>

99
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:25,670
<i>that we have been undergoing
this harsh treatment</i>

100
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:29,937
<i>and our tumor has not responded
to the therapy.</i>

101
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:36,020
<i>If indeed we can very early determine,
with an imaging technique,</i>

102
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,050
<i>"Yes, this therapy is...</i>

103
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:42,810
<i>The tumor is most likely
responding to the therapy,"</i>

104
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:44,730
<i>and will go away with the therapy,</i>

105
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:47,120
<i>then we can basically,
here, for this patient</i>

106
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,890
<i>make the decision after two weeks,</i>

107
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:52,980
<i>we'll have to take another approach
to therapy if one is available,</i>

108
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,200
<i>be it another chemotherapeutic agent,</i>

109
00:06:55,200 --> 00:07:00,300
<i>be it another way of treatment,
to get this tumor to go away.</i>

110
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,310
Now, I mentioned that FDG PET

111
00:07:04,310 --> 00:07:10,398
is the most ubiquitous clinical use
of positron emission tomography.

112
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:16,090
And so, I want to give some examples
where FDG PET was used.

113
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:20,910
This is a whole-body image
of deoxyglucose uptake.

114
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:23,050
We have the brain here.

115
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:26,810
We have the kidneys, they're lighting up,
and we have the bladder,

116
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:28,590
obviously the deoxyglucose

117
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:32,220
is at some point
being secreted into the bladder.

118
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:35,900
This is a normal subject,
and if you look at a malignant lymphoma,

119
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:40,190
this unfortunate subject has uptake
of FDG all over the body,

120
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:45,260
consistent with multiple metastases
in his or her body.

121
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:51,080
So, this ability to detect cancer
in the body,

122
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,720
to determine how many metastases
the primary tumor has formed,

123
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,650
is among the many reasons,
but is a major reason,

124
00:07:58,650 --> 00:08:04,310
why PET has become such an important
clinical modality in practice.

125
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,670
<i>Here's an example of an animal model.</i>

126
00:08:07,670 --> 00:08:12,710
<i>We have FHBG.
This is imaging of gene expression.</i>

127
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,700
<i>We have proliferation with FLT,
and we have FDG glucose uptake.</i>

128
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,890
<i>This is a tumor without treatment here,</i>

129
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:26,930
<i>and here we have a tumor with treatment,
with, actually, gene therapy.</i>

130
00:08:28,910 --> 00:08:32,340
<i>An example here is a CT scan,
again of a rodent.</i>

131
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,250
<i>We have the CT scan, and then,
the cut through the body here</i>

132
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,409
<i>gives us the uptake of the FDG</i>

133
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:43,409
<i>into the body in these chimeric mice,</i>

134
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,590
<i>and these are
another set of mice, also, here.</i>

135
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:50,010
<i>The ability of biomedical imaging
to provide us with information</i>

136
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,680
<i>of what is happening with the animal
with the gene therapy,</i>

137
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,860
<i>or with the therapy, et cetera--</i>

138
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,390
<i>and one has to consider</i>

139
00:08:57,390 --> 00:09:01,550
<i>that the generation
of genetic animal models</i>

140
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,320
<i>is relatively costly--
so the ability to take an animal,</i>

141
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,040
<i>subject it to biomedical imaging
repetitively,</i>

142
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,030
<i>and thereby obtain good measures
of the evolution of the disease</i>

143
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:15,130
<i>or whatever we are looking at,</i>

144
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:18,750
<i>allows us to reduce the number of animals
that need to be produced,</i>

145
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:22,490
<i>and also reduce the number of animals
for animal research.</i>

146
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:27,749
<i>This concludes the examples
for positron emission tomography.</i>

147
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:35,180
Now, in this section, at the last,
I want to provide a rough overview

148
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:37,920
of the x-ray imaging modalities
that we've discussed.

149
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,510
We have primarily discussed
CT, SPECT, and PET,

150
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:47,400
and they share a few things in common.

151
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,950
They do a measurement of a signal
integrated along the line of incidence.

152
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,320
This provides us mathematically
with a Radon transform.

153
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:59,020
They are a bit different
in how they do it.

154
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:03,640
In computed tomography,
it's the attenuated incident x-ray beam.

155
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,060
What is important
to define the Radon transform

156
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:08,520
is that we have
the directionality of the x-ray,

157
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:11,790
so, the direction of the beam
is given by the x-ray source.

158
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,530
Source and detector location,

159
00:10:14,530 --> 00:10:17,390
that defines the directionality
of the photon.

160
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,230
For SPECT, single photon emission
computed tomography,

161
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:26,050
we're measuring a single photon
that's being emitted from a nucleus,

162
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:29,110
and here, to determine
the x-ray direction,

163
00:10:29,110 --> 00:10:32,580
one needs to use collimation,
brute force collimation.

164
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,190
For positron emission tomography,

165
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,250
one measures the annihilation photon pair,

166
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:42,630
so, the directionality of the photons
is given by electronic collimation;

167
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:47,170
that is, the coincidence-- simultaneous--
detection of two photons

168
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:49,440
in two different detectors.

169
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:55,080
<i>We have to apply to the measure
Radon transform corrections--</i>

170
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:58,880
<i>either corrections for scatter,
for attenuation, et cetera.</i>

171
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:02,690
<i>And then, one can use,
since we have the Radon transform,</i>

172
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,540
<i>one can use back-projection
or central slice theorem,</i>

173
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:08,490
<i>and finally, obtain an image.</i>

174
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,770
<i>And here, what's important is,
the minute we can write</i>

175
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:13,880
<i>the process of detecting the signal</i>

176
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:18,770
<i>as a Radon transform,
we know we have the algorithm in place--</i>

177
00:11:18,770 --> 00:11:22,890
<i>that is, back-projection--
that allows us to reconstruct an image.</i>

178
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,640
<i>So, let's summarize here.</i>

179
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,720
<i>The projection encoding is defined
by the incident x-ray.</i>

180
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:36,600
<i>One does use collimation
to reduce scatter.</i>

181
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,470
<i>For SPECT, we need a collimate,
that's essential,</i>

182
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:43,800
<i>there's no other way we can establish
the directionality of the x-ray,</i>

183
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:47,870
<i>and for PET, it is coincidence detection
that does the projection encoding,</i>

184
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,260
<i>or as it's also called,
electronic collimation.</i>

185
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:55,870
<i>To give you an idea
what the spatial resolution is,</i>

186
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:59,760
<i>spatial resolution is on the order
of hundreds of microns in humans</i>

187
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,670
<i>to millimeters for CT.</i>

188
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:04,260
<i>For SPECT, we have around a centimeter,</i>

189
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:08,430
<i>and around four to five millimeters
for PET at the center.</i>

190
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:12,850
<i>If we are looking at a micro-CT,
micro-SPECT or micro-PET,</i>

191
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:17,780
<i>small animal scanner, we're on the order
of micrometers for CT,</i>

192
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:22,100
<i>a few millimeters for SPECT,
and we can get down to a millimeter--</i>

193
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:27,320
<i>that is the theoretical
positron range for PET.</i>

194
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:33,580
<i>Attenuation in CT
is the measurement variable.</i>

195
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,950
<i>What here is important</i>

196
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:38,350
<i>that the attenuation varies
with photon energy.</i>

197
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:42,580
<i>In SPECT, the attenuation
requires a complex correction,</i>

198
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:44,950
<i>which also varies with photon energy,</i>

199
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,880
<i>and for PET, we can do
an accurate correction with,</i>

200
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:51,670
<i>for example, the transmission method.</i>

201
00:12:53,570 --> 00:12:56,110
<i>What are the radionuclides in CT?</i>

202
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,370
<i>We do not use radionuclides
that we administer,</i>

203
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:04,160
<i>so, it is the absorption of the x-ray
in the body that we are measuring,</i>

204
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,230
<i>but we can administer so-called
contrast agents.</i>

205
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:09,790
<i>Those are compounds that modify</i>

206
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:13,650
<i>the linear attenuation coefficient
of the tissue where they are,</i>

207
00:13:13,650 --> 00:13:17,000
<i>so they are... but they are not
strictly-sense radionuclides,</i>

208
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:20,910
<i>although they have similar properties
as the tracers</i>

209
00:13:20,910 --> 00:13:24,590
<i>that are being used
for the other techniques.</i>

210
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:27,560
<i>For SPECT, essentially
any single-photon emitter</i>

211
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,000
<i>that are typically between 60 and 200
kiloelectron-volts can be used,</i>

212
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:35,030
<i>and for positron emission tomography,</i>

213
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:38,920
<i>we are obviously limited to nuclei
that emit the positrons,</i>

214
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:43,050
<i>so we are only able
to image positron emitters.</i>

215
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:46,360
<i>So, we have a wider
choice of radionuclides</i>

216
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,340
<i>with SPECT than with PET,</i>

217
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:52,160
<i>but with PET
we have a higher sensitivity,</i>

218
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:55,420
<i>as we have coincidence detection.</i>

219
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:00,130
<i>In terms of cost of the techniques,
the cost increases to the right,</i>

220
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,780
<i>for the instrumentation--</i>

221
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:05,070
<i>for pure purchase of the scanner,
increases to the right.</i>

222
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:10,200
<i>In particular, since PET nowadays
is only sold as PET-CT.</i>

223
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:15,620
So, this concludes the section
on x-ray imaging techniques.

224
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:18,280
These are the major techniques
that we have discussed.

225
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:23,790
Next week, we will discuss
how we analyze radio tracer data

226
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:26,320
that we've obtained
with either contrast agents

227
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:32,090
or with x-ray emitting
tracers in the body.
