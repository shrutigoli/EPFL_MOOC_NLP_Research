1
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:06,261
We'll continue now with the question:

2
00:00:06,261 --> 00:00:09,147
What is the importance of bio-imaging?

3
00:00:10,607 --> 00:00:13,071
How important is this, really?

4
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:21,347
Actually, nowadays life sciences,
medical diagnosis or medical practice,

5
00:00:21,347 --> 00:00:26,046
both of them are unthinkable
without biomedical imaging.

6
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,563
One of the main features 
or contributions to this

7
00:00:30,563 --> 00:00:36,282
has been that we have a way 
to assess biological processes

8
00:00:36,282 --> 00:00:39,292
with minimal perturbation of the system.

9
00:00:39,292 --> 00:00:42,772
We can peer into the body,
look at processes,

10
00:00:42,772 --> 00:00:47,533
and we do not have to go inside
with any invasive means.

11
00:00:48,053 --> 00:00:53,003
Major discoveries in medicine
have been done based on cadaver discovery

12
00:00:53,003 --> 00:00:55,873
or discoveries during surgery.

13
00:00:55,873 --> 00:00:59,494
Here, with biomedical imaging,
it is completely non-invasive

14
00:00:59,494 --> 00:01:02,952
and without influence on the subject.

15
00:01:03,503 --> 00:01:05,533
We'll give you some examples.

16
00:01:05,853 --> 00:01:11,052
We have, in terms of applications,
humans, animal research,

17
00:01:11,052 --> 00:01:14,963
it's also important 
to be minimally invasive,

18
00:01:14,963 --> 00:01:18,305
but also, sometimes it's cell preparations
or organ preparations

19
00:01:18,305 --> 00:01:22,765
that one wants to study
with biomedical imaging.

20
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:27,095
What are the modalities 
that are often used?

21
00:01:27,925 --> 00:01:30,104
We have x-ray techniques.

22
00:01:30,104 --> 00:01:34,784
You've most likely been exposed
to this technique,

23
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:38,854
for example, a chest x-ray
if you have pneumonia,

24
00:01:39,305 --> 00:01:42,733
dental x-rays, or if you have a fracture,

25
00:01:44,143 --> 00:01:47,095
computer tomography
is derived from x-rays,

26
00:01:47,095 --> 00:01:49,854
is a more advanced way of imaging.
That one we will discuss.

27
00:01:49,854 --> 00:01:52,875
X-rays, simple x-rays,
we'll not discuss in this course.

28
00:01:54,145 --> 00:01:59,035
Positron emission tomography,
magnetic resonance.

29
00:01:59,035 --> 00:02:02,126
We have ultrasound for those of you

30
00:02:02,126 --> 00:02:08,105
who have been born 
in the last two to three decades.

31
00:02:08,105 --> 00:02:12,176
We have pretty much 
all been exposed to ultrasound technique

32
00:02:12,176 --> 00:02:17,385
in uterus, when we were fetuses,
or if you are a parent,

33
00:02:17,385 --> 00:02:20,847
then your child has 
been exposed to ultrasound

34
00:02:21,738 --> 00:02:25,256
if you've had children, most likely,
at least in the Western World.

35
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:27,375
There's also electrical imaging

36
00:02:27,375 --> 00:02:30,311
measuring the electrical currents 
in the brain.

37
00:02:30,311 --> 00:02:32,012
That's EEG or MEG.

38
00:02:32,012 --> 00:02:34,592
Those techniques we will not 
discuss in this course.

39
00:02:34,592 --> 00:02:38,831
They are very distinct, 
and then there are, of course,

40
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:40,903
also optical imaging techniques,

41
00:02:40,903 --> 00:02:44,842
that is using optical photons, 
visible photons, or infrared

42
00:02:44,842 --> 00:02:47,271
to image inside the tissue.

43
00:02:47,271 --> 00:02:50,774
Those techniques we will not 
discuss in this course either,

44
00:02:54,604 --> 00:02:57,841
mainly for the purpose of that here, 
in the the EPFL there are excellent--

45
00:03:00,431 --> 00:03:03,521
--lectures treating
just with these topics.

46
00:03:04,594 --> 00:03:10,645
And the key feature for this course
is the element that these techniques,

47
00:03:11,795 --> 00:03:16,496
imaging techniques, bio-imaging
capabilities, effects, contrast, etc.

48
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:19,194
they are unthinkable without physics.

49
00:03:19,194 --> 00:03:23,074
They are bio-physical processes
that are deeply rooted in these techniques

50
00:03:23,074 --> 00:03:25,864
and we will discuss them,
how these effects,

51
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:29,886
how the construction
of these cameras, these devices,

52
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:32,025
how that influences signal-to-noise ratio,

53
00:03:32,025 --> 00:03:35,656
contrast-to-noise ratio,
resolution, what kind of abilities

54
00:03:35,656 --> 00:03:40,375
we can deduce from these modalities.

55
00:03:42,185 --> 00:03:45,505
So now, if we look 
at biomedical imaging,

56
00:03:46,245 --> 00:03:49,745
what are the things that we need
in biomedical imaging.

57
00:03:49,745 --> 00:03:51,535
Obviously, we need life sciences.

58
00:03:51,535 --> 00:03:53,105
We need a living system.

59
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:55,414
We need physics.

60
00:03:55,414 --> 00:03:58,996
And here in the course for life sciences,
I will discuss primarily applications

61
00:03:58,996 --> 00:04:01,125
in neuroscience and cancer.

62
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,875
I'll illustrate it mainly 
from these two sides.

63
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:08,486
Now physics, the notions
that in this course

64
00:04:08,486 --> 00:04:12,575
that we will make use of
are electrodynamics,

65
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:16,666
in particular, Faraday's Law, for example.

66
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:21,406
Quantum mechanics-- we will not discuss 
quantum mechanics per se,

67
00:04:21,406 --> 00:04:25,056
but we are going to discuss 
a technique that's deeply rooted

68
00:04:25,056 --> 00:04:28,656
in quantum mechanics
and that is magnetic resonance imaging.

69
00:04:28,656 --> 00:04:32,798
We have also thermodynamics 
considerations to consider,

70
00:04:32,798 --> 00:04:36,186
and also some elements 
of classical mechanics

71
00:04:36,186 --> 00:04:39,317
that we will be using from the physics.

72
00:04:41,338 --> 00:04:45,087
A good scanner with just life science
and physics will not function.

73
00:04:45,087 --> 00:04:48,996
We need also for the techniques,
we'll need good engineering,

74
00:04:48,996 --> 00:04:50,917
good instrumentation.

75
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:54,266
We need electrical engineering,
mechanical engineering,

76
00:04:54,266 --> 00:04:56,977
sometimes we need biomedical engineering

77
00:04:58,577 --> 00:05:02,048
to make these devices work optimally,

78
00:05:02,847 --> 00:05:04,776
and, of course, we need good mathematics.

79
00:05:04,776 --> 00:05:07,928
We've already dealt 
with the contrast-to-noise ratio

80
00:05:07,928 --> 00:05:10,106
with some elements of math that we need.

81
00:05:10,106 --> 00:05:12,508
We need good mathematics.

82
00:05:14,066 --> 00:05:18,518
And finally, in biomedical imaging,
one also needs chemistry,

83
00:05:18,518 --> 00:05:20,748
and we will also discuss 
where chemistry comes in

84
00:05:20,748 --> 00:05:23,098
with contrast agents.

85
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:26,528
We do not need to be experts 
in every one of the fields,

86
00:05:27,428 --> 00:05:30,208
but what is fascinating 
what brought me into this field

87
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:35,539
is the ability to interact 
with such diverse disciplines

88
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:39,259
to work really at the interface 
of all these different disciplines

89
00:05:39,259 --> 00:05:43,147
to learn from them, 
take what we learn from them,

90
00:05:43,147 --> 00:05:46,265
adapt them, take what we have
in the needs in cancer

91
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:48,145
and neuroscience, for example,

92
00:05:48,145 --> 00:05:50,907
how they impact instrumentation,
the engineering,

93
00:05:51,947 --> 00:05:54,856
what we want to measure, 
mathematics, for example,

94
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:58,816
or the compounds that we'd like 
to image the distribution

95
00:05:59,546 --> 00:06:03,187
to work with chemists
on synthesizing those compounds

96
00:06:03,187 --> 00:06:05,726
or developing those compounds.

97
00:06:05,726 --> 00:06:09,997
That is what makes 
biomedical imaging a very exciting

98
00:06:09,997 --> 00:06:15,087
and interesting field to work with 
is to have all these interplays.

99
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:21,037
Like I said, we do not have to
be experts in every one of them,

100
00:06:21,037 --> 00:06:24,366
but we have to be willing
to work at the fringe of our disciplines,

101
00:06:24,366 --> 00:06:29,526
and so multidisciplinarity, 
a willingness to engage

102
00:06:29,526 --> 00:06:32,487
one with another is important.

103
00:06:33,558 --> 00:06:35,447
And then, if we think about our brains,

104
00:06:35,447 --> 00:06:38,057
this is actually 
what our brain already does.

105
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:40,067
If we look at the brain organization,

106
00:06:40,067 --> 00:06:43,009
we have all sorts of brain areas 
that do different things.

107
00:06:43,779 --> 00:06:46,147
We hear here in Broca's area,

108
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:48,018
we move our fingers in this area,

109
00:06:48,018 --> 00:06:50,007
we feel heat in this area,

110
00:06:50,007 --> 00:06:51,758
we see here in this area,

111
00:06:51,782 --> 00:06:53,475
we listen also here,

112
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:55,662
and we process what we see here.

113
00:06:56,184 --> 00:07:00,200
So our brain and these areas are 
all simultaneously active.

114
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:04,029
And so we can, of course, 
deal with all sorts

115
00:07:04,029 --> 00:07:07,339
of different disciplines
having some insight in them,

116
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:11,700
gaining some aspects,
using aspects of them

117
00:07:11,711 --> 00:07:15,496
without being an expert 
in all of these techniques.

118
00:07:17,089 --> 00:07:22,297
So now here's a question,
what is the perfect imaging modality?

119
00:07:23,033 --> 00:07:25,824
What would you like it to be able to do?

120
00:07:27,726 --> 00:07:31,522
Well, you want something easy to use.

121
00:07:32,732 --> 00:07:34,400
Here's an example.

122
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:36,950
It should be portable.

123
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,992
We have the example here again.

124
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:43,397
And it should be highly sensitive
and produce excellent contrast.

125
00:07:43,397 --> 00:07:47,070
Taking pictures of you or someone 
that you take a picture of

126
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:50,442
with a camera here
that's built in into the smartphone,

127
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:52,423
that affords all that.

128
00:07:52,423 --> 00:07:55,323
Like I said, this is not 
an imaging technique

129
00:07:55,324 --> 00:07:57,112
for the intent of our course.

130
00:07:57,112 --> 00:07:58,504
We won't consider that,

131
00:07:58,504 --> 00:08:00,784
but in principle that's portable,

132
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:02,263
I can take pictures.

133
00:08:02,686 --> 00:08:04,916
The question does this exist,

134
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:08,686
something like this, like a cellphone,
a smartphone camera,

135
00:08:08,686 --> 00:08:11,965
built-in camera, does that exist
for biomedical imaging?

136
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:19,755
In theory, it exists 
but not in reality.

137
00:08:20,035 --> 00:08:22,215
In Hollywood, it exists.

138
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:25,945
You might recognize this gentleman here,

139
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:29,685
if you look at the people 
appearing in here,

140
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:32,867
what he's carrying in his hand is--

141
00:08:34,557 --> 00:08:35,867
on the right side,

142
00:08:35,867 --> 00:08:39,296
is the equivalent of a smartphone
communication device.

143
00:08:39,296 --> 00:08:42,335
In his left hand he has what 
they call a tricorder.

144
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:46,283
And a tricorder in <i>Star Trek</i>
and the following series,

145
00:08:47,113 --> 00:08:51,755
they use it essentially, to diagnose you
on 10 meters distance,

146
00:08:52,225 --> 00:08:53,494
they're able to diagnose

147
00:08:53,494 --> 00:08:57,890
whether you have some genetic alteration

148
00:08:57,890 --> 00:09:01,482
that you've been subjected to
by exposure to an alien species.

149
00:09:02,723 --> 00:09:08,190
So in Hollywood, this kind 
of device called tricorder,

150
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:10,762
the perfect imaging modality exists.

151
00:09:10,762 --> 00:09:14,992
It allows them to simply, rapidly diagnose
without touching the subject

152
00:09:16,282 --> 00:09:20,221
to diagnose their disease
even down to genetic diseases.

153
00:09:21,381 --> 00:09:26,022
Unfortunately, this does not exist for us,

154
00:09:26,022 --> 00:09:30,012
but here's an example
which is very close,

155
00:09:30,012 --> 00:09:33,812
we are looking here at a video
from a dolphin,

156
00:09:33,812 --> 00:09:36,571
and this dolphin is pregnant,
has a fetus in it.

157
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:41,322
And we have the doctor 
in this aquarium in Florida,

158
00:09:41,322 --> 00:09:45,735
he carries on the front of his head,
he carries the output

159
00:09:45,735 --> 00:09:49,514
of the computed image,
so the ultrasound image

160
00:09:49,514 --> 00:09:53,233
that's generated by a computer
in real life and with his right hand

161
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:57,204
he holds a transducer 
to the belly of the dolphin,

162
00:09:57,204 --> 00:10:00,803
so he's showing the images,
and we can see the images here,

163
00:10:00,803 --> 00:10:04,432
the dolphin baby 
in the belly of its mother.

164
00:10:05,232 --> 00:10:07,513
The mother still stays 
in her natural environment,

165
00:10:07,513 --> 00:10:09,702
so it's still in the water basement.

166
00:10:09,702 --> 00:10:11,483
They're just holding her still.

167
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:17,141
So this is fairly close to being
a minimal invasive technique.

168
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:21,052
It is easy to use,
a person just holding it.

169
00:10:21,052 --> 00:10:22,112
It's portable.

170
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:24,633
He went to the dolphin.

171
00:10:24,633 --> 00:10:28,413
And it provides decent sensitivity
and good contrast.

172
00:10:29,491 --> 00:10:34,031
However, what we have 
to consider is that in reality,

173
00:10:35,021 --> 00:10:39,730
each imaging method or modality
has its strengths and limitations.

174
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:42,950
We can't have it all.

175
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,751
Either they are strong on one side.

176
00:10:48,239 --> 00:10:51,438
They're able to depict 
one certain tissue feature,

177
00:10:51,438 --> 00:10:54,523
one technique and do it better
than the other and vice versa.

178
00:10:54,523 --> 00:10:58,712
And we have limitations as well
in the techniques.

179
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:03,209
And the goal of this course is
to bring closer to you

180
00:11:03,209 --> 00:11:07,201
an appreciation of these strengths 
and limitations of these techniques,

181
00:11:07,201 --> 00:11:10,251
and particularly the physical reasons
that are behind it

182
00:11:10,251 --> 00:11:13,760
because there are physical reasons,
the biophysical phenomenon

183
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:17,111
or physical phenomenon
that we are exploiting

184
00:11:17,111 --> 00:11:20,702
for these imaging techniques.
