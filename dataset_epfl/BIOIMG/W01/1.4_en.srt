1
00:00:04,498 --> 00:00:09,848
In the last segment of this week
we will conclude by some examples,

2
00:00:10,037 --> 00:00:13,467
and I'll start off 
with something very basic.

3
00:00:13,908 --> 00:00:16,217
For those of you in biological sciences

4
00:00:16,217 --> 00:00:18,457
you may be familiar 
with these graphs here.

5
00:00:18,457 --> 00:00:19,687
These are gels.

6
00:00:20,407 --> 00:00:22,711
What is happening here 
is that there are proteins

7
00:00:22,711 --> 00:00:25,411
that are put at the end of the gel

8
00:00:25,411 --> 00:00:30,166
and then, based for example 
on electrical gradient,

9
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:33,526
the proteins start to bond 
in one direction in this gel,

10
00:00:33,526 --> 00:00:35,765
and the proteins carry radioactive charge

11
00:00:35,765 --> 00:00:38,675
like phosphorus-32, tritium or carbon-14.

12
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:42,034
Then they are exposed to a camera,

13
00:00:42,034 --> 00:00:45,126
and we can see 
how far the protein has moved.

14
00:00:45,296 --> 00:00:50,794
This is an imaging way to determine 
the mass of a protein

15
00:00:50,794 --> 00:00:53,264
of a product that one has isolated.

16
00:00:54,044 --> 00:00:57,444
The procedure that's used here is, 
we have the support here,

17
00:00:57,444 --> 00:01:00,164
we have the specimen--
in this case it would be the gel,

18
00:01:00,492 --> 00:01:03,232
and on top of here 
is the photographic emulsion,

19
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:06,869
that is, the electrons are passing 
through the photographic emulsion

20
00:01:06,869 --> 00:01:11,229
then create a chemical reaction, 
which is what essentially is imaged here.

21
00:01:11,229 --> 00:01:17,739
So this is the standard way
of producing early images,

22
00:01:18,398 --> 00:01:23,808
and this has been used also,
mainly some time ago,

23
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:27,069
for imaging, for example, brain slices.

24
00:01:27,069 --> 00:01:32,991
So what was done here, 
this is a rodent brain cut into slices.

25
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:36,731
These slices are then
placed on a support,

26
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:39,181
and the film is placed on top of it.

27
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:41,510
That creates a photographic image here

28
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:45,540
of the radioactivity 
that's inside this brain slice.

29
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:50,217
So obviously there was some radioactivity
injected into this animal here,

30
00:01:50,217 --> 00:01:52,492
and we can see here some compound

31
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:56,923
that's accumulated in this particular area 
implicated in Parkinson disease,

32
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:58,453
namely substantia nigra.

33
00:01:58,953 --> 00:02:00,508
On these examples--

34
00:02:00,508 --> 00:02:02,638
I want to end with a--

35
00:02:03,738 --> 00:02:06,828
-- a very prominent example
from monkey brains--

36
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:10,137
so this is now uptake 
here, in the brain, of glucose,

37
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:13,700
which is a main substrate 
that allows us to think.

38
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:16,340
Here is the glucose radioactivity marked.

39
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:19,921
This is the fine structure of the area.

40
00:02:20,201 --> 00:02:23,713
And now, what this monkey--
so this is a brain slice--

41
00:02:23,713 --> 00:02:28,312
so this monkey was exposed 
to radioactive glucose and to some task.

42
00:02:28,312 --> 00:02:29,687
The task we can see here.

43
00:02:29,687 --> 00:02:34,586
The monkey was looking at this image here,
and looking at this image,

44
00:02:34,586 --> 00:02:37,595
there has been a representation 
of glucose uptake

45
00:02:37,595 --> 00:02:39,405
in his visual cortex

46
00:02:39,715 --> 00:02:43,155
according to the activity 
of what he is seeing,

47
00:02:43,155 --> 00:02:47,682
and actually what one can see here is
the uptake of glucose is high in a pattern

48
00:02:47,682 --> 00:02:52,137
that resembles to structures 
that he has been looking at.

49
00:02:52,137 --> 00:02:56,593
So we actually have--
this has been a very important insight,

50
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:59,493
we have a representation with imaging,

51
00:02:59,493 --> 00:03:04,468
representation of the outside world 
directly in our brain,

52
00:03:04,468 --> 00:03:07,050
that is a fairly good match.

53
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:10,700
And a few years back 
some researchers in Boston

54
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:13,631
have actually shown with functional MRI,

55
00:03:13,631 --> 00:03:16,634
showing them the letter M
in Martinos, Massachusetts

56
00:03:17,514 --> 00:03:22,004
but this letter M showed up also 
in the brain of the volunteers.

57
00:03:23,398 --> 00:03:25,413
So why would we even bother developing

58
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,293
biomedical imaging techniques?

59
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:29,267
What is the advantage 
compared to tissue analysis?

60
00:03:29,267 --> 00:03:30,910
The examples that I just gave you

61
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,490
actually don't give us 
any major advantages.

62
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:36,885
Well, I'll give you an example here,

63
00:03:36,885 --> 00:03:38,114
we are looking at mice

64
00:03:38,114 --> 00:03:40,814
that were subjected 
to 30 minutes of stroke,

65
00:03:40,814 --> 00:03:43,655
and they were assessed 
using MRI at 3 hours--

66
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:46,345
that is here--
7 hours,

67
00:03:47,525 --> 00:03:52,245
before 3 hours, 7 hours 
and 24 hours after the stroke.

68
00:03:52,883 --> 00:03:55,103
That is the same mouse 
that we are looking at

69
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:58,903
before and after the stroke
at different timepoints.

70
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:03,483
In the end, after 24 hours,
the brain was extracted, slices were cut

71
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:08,217
and with Nitro staining here 
the neurons were counted;

72
00:04:08,217 --> 00:04:11,181
one can see very nicely 
the lesion of the stroke here

73
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:13,941
corresponding to what we see 
in the MRI image.

74
00:04:15,472 --> 00:04:19,117
So we have one mouse here--
we have looked at it over 24 hours

75
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:23,117
and in the end we can do 
a tissue analysis in extraction.

76
00:04:23,447 --> 00:04:27,433
The tissue extraction 
is pretty much always final,

77
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:31,509
if you want to look at the tissue, 
and there is no continuation of the study.

78
00:04:31,509 --> 00:04:35,779
So we have the ability 
to produce longitudinal studies

79
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,951
and repeated studies.

80
00:04:39,311 --> 00:04:43,486
So, let's say, if we take Bio-imaging

81
00:04:43,486 --> 00:04:47,766
relative to histology 
for invasive tissue analysis,

82
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:51,736
typically the information is gathered 
relatively rapidly,

83
00:04:51,866 --> 00:04:54,156
we acquire these images in a few minutes.

84
00:04:55,016 --> 00:04:56,736
They were acquired in a few minutes.

85
00:04:57,156 --> 00:05:00,114
Tissue dissection means 
freezing the tissue,

86
00:05:00,114 --> 00:05:05,006
dissecting with a microtome imaging,

87
00:05:05,006 --> 00:05:06,847
we are non-destructive,

88
00:05:06,847 --> 00:05:09,454
the mouse in principle 
after this measurement,

89
00:05:09,454 --> 00:05:12,194
and this measurement and so on, 
was the same mouse,

90
00:05:12,194 --> 00:05:15,364
so not impaired by the fact 
that we took the image.

91
00:05:15,368 --> 00:05:17,670
So one has minimal perturbation.

92
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:22,402
The Bio-imaging techniques 
are either in situ or even in vivo,

93
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:23,970
typically in vivo,

94
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,955
and therefore repetitive, that is,
longitudinal studies are possible,

95
00:05:28,955 --> 00:05:31,704
which gives us 
an increased statistical power,

96
00:05:31,704 --> 00:05:36,075
a reduced number of samples therefore 
and this role decide features.

97
00:05:37,085 --> 00:05:41,145
Here is an example 
of the ultrasound of a mouse heart.

98
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:46,577
You don't think of ultrasound 
as a technique used on mice,

99
00:05:46,577 --> 00:05:48,627
and certainly not for mouse heart.

100
00:05:48,627 --> 00:05:50,329
Think about how small a mouse is,

101
00:05:50,329 --> 00:05:53,136
think about how small the mouse heart is,

102
00:05:53,136 --> 00:05:56,768
one can develop a technique, 
an ultrasound technique here,

103
00:05:56,768 --> 00:05:59,378
that is adapted to such small geometries,

104
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:01,507
and, as shown in this video,

105
00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:05,477
one can obtain very good images 
of the beating mouse heart

106
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:06,607
in real time.

107
00:06:06,897 --> 00:06:09,089
Think about how fast 
the mouse beats--

108
00:06:09,089 --> 00:06:11,779
it is several hundred times per minute--

109
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:17,652
to get an appreciation of the challenges 
that were overcome here, in this example.

110
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:21,132
And, of course, we can also 
see here the volunteer, the mouse,

111
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:25,799
which all it is subjected to
is putting a transducer on its chest.

112
00:06:27,179 --> 00:06:30,287
So we have some other examples here

113
00:06:30,877 --> 00:06:32,497
for biomedical imaging.

114
00:06:32,497 --> 00:06:35,767
What you see here on the left is a--

115
00:06:36,627 --> 00:06:38,491
3D rendering of a tumor.

116
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:39,681
You can see the image.

117
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:42,039
So this is an MRI image

118
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:45,064
taken of a person for surgical planning.

119
00:06:45,064 --> 00:06:48,050
You see on the top of the head 
the fiducial markers

120
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:52,809
that allow the neurosurgeon
to determine exactly the stereotaxic,

121
00:06:52,809 --> 00:06:54,809
that is, the coordinates of the brain,

122
00:06:54,809 --> 00:06:57,549
and then with the contrast
that's generated by the image

123
00:06:57,549 --> 00:07:01,541
with a computer 
a three-dimensional image is generated,

124
00:07:02,111 --> 00:07:04,632
based on the contrast color-coded

125
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:08,813
we have the tumor highlighted,
as you can see here,

126
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:12,850
and that tumor is then,
very well defined in the image

127
00:07:12,850 --> 00:07:16,220
with respect to 
the fiducial markers in its position,

128
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,169
and very often it is much easier 
to distinguish the contrast,

129
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:22,259
that is, to distinguish 
the defective tissue,

130
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,783
the disease tissue from the normal tissue 
than looking at it by eye.

131
00:07:26,783 --> 00:07:29,955
So this helps enormously 
in either planning

132
00:07:29,955 --> 00:07:32,060
where exactly to do the surgery

133
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:37,780
or, if you do radiotherapy,
to have an exact location of the tumor.

134
00:07:38,335 --> 00:07:42,218
Here is another example 
of a very often used technique--

135
00:07:42,218 --> 00:07:44,018
it's positron emission tomography,

136
00:07:44,018 --> 00:07:48,262
and it illustrates 
its major use in imaging.

137
00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:51,076
You can see here, this is glucose--

138
00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:53,286
you see the brain 
takes up a lot of glucose,

139
00:07:53,286 --> 00:07:54,482
we use glucose to think--

140
00:07:54,482 --> 00:07:57,482
we have also here, 
in the bladder, glucose.

141
00:07:57,482 --> 00:08:00,802
For obvious reasons, the glucose
that was injected ends up in the bladder,

142
00:08:00,802 --> 00:08:04,082
and this part here 
in the center, it's the heart.

143
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:06,371
Next to the heart 
you can see this dark spot

144
00:08:06,371 --> 00:08:08,031
that should not be there--

145
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:09,689
that is a metastasis.

146
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:14,049
So with this technique,
when it's used in practical means

147
00:08:14,049 --> 00:08:15,399
is to detect metastases,

148
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:20,491
to determine how many metastases 
are there over the whole body.

149
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:22,741
This is of course important

150
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:26,581
for deciding what treatment 
approaches to use.

151
00:08:27,435 --> 00:08:30,375
And here is the last example, 
this is the--

152
00:08:32,155 --> 00:08:34,643
this functional imaging 
of a complex task--

153
00:08:34,643 --> 00:08:37,913
I think it was 
a mental rotation task in this case,

154
00:08:37,913 --> 00:08:40,083
showing the ventral medial stream

155
00:08:40,493 --> 00:08:44,243
in such a fairly complex mental task.

156
00:08:44,243 --> 00:08:47,413
One can see the many brain areas
that are activated--

157
00:08:47,413 --> 00:08:48,643
they are shown in red--

158
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:51,713
overlaid on an anatomical image 
of the subject's head

159
00:08:51,713 --> 00:08:53,493
obtained with MRI,

160
00:08:53,493 --> 00:08:58,671
so this technique functional MRI 
provides an insight

161
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:03,171
into the activation patterns 
when one does a certain task,

162
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:07,046
how different brain areas are involved.

163
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,040
So these are 
just some examples to illustrate

164
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,120
some of the potentials,

165
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,836
some of the applications 
of the techniques.

166
00:09:17,836 --> 00:09:21,366
We will during the course, 
of course, illustrate

167
00:09:22,026 --> 00:09:24,486
every technique 
that we discuss with examples,

168
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:28,236
typically at the beginning 
and at the end of the lecture.
