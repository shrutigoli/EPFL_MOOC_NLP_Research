1
00:00:04,709 --> 00:00:09,460
Let's talk about optimization
of contrast-to-noise ratio

2
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:10,707
and signal-to-noise ratio.

3
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,074
But first, the question is,
"How can we optimize

4
00:00:13,075 --> 00:00:16,209
the signal-to-noise ratio
of our measurement?"

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:20,021
So one way that I want
to talk about here is--

6
00:00:20,991 --> 00:00:22,941
by repeated measurements.

7
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:24,640
So let's have you
repeat the measurements,

8
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:25,962
and we'll call them <i>S_i</i>,

9
00:00:25,963 --> 00:00:29,168
where <i>I</i> is the index
of the <i>N</i> repeated measurements.

10
00:00:30,384 --> 00:00:32,821
And now we obtain an average measurement--

11
00:00:32,822 --> 00:00:36,662
that's an average signal,
which I call here <i>&lt;S&gt;</i>.

12
00:00:37,224 --> 00:00:39,617
That's a sum of all the measurements
divided by <i>N</i>--

13
00:00:39,737 --> 00:00:42,757
that is the deviated
definition of average.

14
00:00:45,109 --> 00:00:49,328
Now, the signal-to-noise ratio
that we obtained here

15
00:00:49,329 --> 00:00:52,749
depends on the square root of law.

16
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:57,087
That law--I will briefly show
where this comes from

17
00:00:57,088 --> 00:00:59,000
So what this means is,

18
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:01,780
if we do four repeated measurements
of the same thing

19
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:03,665
we are averaging together,

20
00:01:03,666 --> 00:01:06,726
the precision of the measurement
is improved by twofold.

21
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:11,198
Let's just do a quick demonstration.

22
00:01:11,199 --> 00:01:14,515
For some of you this must be
the standard theory

23
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:17,445
from statistical courses
that you may have taken,

24
00:01:17,446 --> 00:01:19,151
for others it might be new.

25
00:01:19,152 --> 00:01:23,217
So we'll take here just a demonstration
of the square root law.

26
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:27,668
So I'll compose the <i>I</i>-th measurement,
one of the <i>N</i> measurements,

27
00:01:27,669 --> 00:01:32,491
as the true signal S
plus a source of noise <i>ε_i</i>.

28
00:01:32,492 --> 00:01:35,779
So for the 3rd measurement,
for example, <i>S_3</i>,

29
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:40,569
we have the true variable S
plus a contribution of noise

30
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:44,010
which we call <i>ε_3</i>, now
indicated by the index <i>I</i>

31
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:50,708
The expectation value,
the average of <i>ε_i</i> square,

32
00:01:50,709 --> 00:01:52,792
is by definition <i>σ</i> squared,

33
00:01:52,822 --> 00:01:54,736
and the other thing that we introduce is

34
00:01:54,856 --> 00:01:57,918
that the noise has an expectation value,
the amplitude of zero,

35
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,937
so <i>ε_i</i> will average to zero.

36
00:02:00,938 --> 00:02:05,178
So it's not contributing
to systematic values.

37
00:02:06,098 --> 00:02:10,398
So now <i>S</i> is the true signal,
which for a moment is unknown.

38
00:02:11,115 --> 00:02:15,054
We have the average signal
which is sum of <i>S_i</i> divided by <i>N</i>.

39
00:02:15,055 --> 00:02:19,114
This is equal to <i>S</i>,
because it is <i>N</i> times <i>S</i> divided by <i>N</i>,

40
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:21,711
plus sum of the <i>ε_i</i> divided by <i>N</i>.

41
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:24,382
This is our average signal.

42
00:02:25,252 --> 00:02:26,517
Now, we'll define here

43
00:02:26,518 --> 00:02:29,748
the deviation
of our measured signal, <i>&lt;S&gt;</i> here

44
00:02:30,328 --> 00:02:35,448
minus the true signal
which we suppose exists.

45
00:02:36,065 --> 00:02:40,615
That is then equal to the sum of the <i>ε_i</i>
divided by the number of measurements.

46
00:02:42,375 --> 00:02:47,334
Now we will calculate the square of <i>Δ S</i>.

47
00:02:47,805 --> 00:02:54,015
<i>Δ S</i> square, so that's the sum
of <i>ε_i</i>-s squared divided N squared,

48
00:02:55,496 --> 00:02:59,876
and now we will dissect this sum here
into different terms.

49
00:03:00,524 --> 00:03:03,583
We have the terms
where <i>ε_i</i> is multiplied by <i>ε_i</i>.

50
00:03:03,584 --> 00:03:06,119
So it gives us the sum of <i>ε_i </i>-s squared,

51
00:03:06,626 --> 00:03:09,918
and then we have a sum
where <i>I</i> and <i>j</i> are not the same,

52
00:03:09,948 --> 00:03:12,157
so the error of the second measurement

53
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:14,838
is multiplied by the error
of the third measurement etc.,

54
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:18,438
over all sample--that's this term here.

55
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:24,930
This term here is essentially
the expectation value of <i>ε_i</i> times <i>ε_j</i>.

56
00:03:25,286 --> 00:03:29,479
And that goes to zero
because we have here that on average

57
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:33,250
the error has an average value of zero.

58
00:03:34,975 --> 00:03:38,945
So if you multiply the error
in the 3rd measurement

59
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:43,278
and sum it with
multiplication of the errors

60
00:03:43,279 --> 00:03:48,939
of all the other measurements--
this is <i>ε_3</i> times <i>ε_j</i>,

61
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:50,879
where <i>I</i> is not equal to <i>j</i>.

62
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:55,130
Then on average <i>ε_j</i> goes to zero,
so this term here goes to zero.

63
00:03:56,225 --> 00:03:59,404
And now we are coming to <i>Δ S</i> square,

64
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:02,404
this equals to the sum of <i>ε_i</i> square,

65
00:04:02,405 --> 00:04:04,865
which is nothing but <i>N</i> time (<i>σ</i> square),

66
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:07,869
this we had here, this term here,

67
00:04:08,999 --> 00:04:13,077
sum of <i>ε_i</i> square is <i>N (σ squared)</i>

68
00:04:13,078 --> 00:04:16,973
and so we now have the error,
the deviation,

69
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:20,934
<i>(Δ S)</i> square is equal to
<i>σ</i> square divided by <i>N</i>.

70
00:04:21,264 --> 00:04:24,253
Or, in other words,
the average amplitude of the noise,

71
00:04:24,254 --> 00:04:29,673
that is, deviation of our measurement
relative to the ground truth, the <i>S</i>,

72
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:33,851
the average value is given
by <i>σ</i> divided by square root <i>N</i>,

73
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:34,857
where <i>N</i> is the number

74
00:04:34,977 --> 00:04:37,167
of repeated measurements
that we have done.

75
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:40,422
So this gives us the square root law.

76
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:45,831
So this means--this is known very well
from statistics--

77
00:04:45,834 --> 00:04:48,824
I've really arrived here
at fairly standard formula.

78
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:50,558
What this means is

79
00:04:50,559 --> 00:04:54,398
that if we want improve
the signal-to-noise ratio

80
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:56,256
by repeated measurements

81
00:04:56,257 --> 00:04:59,027
we have to increase the measurement time.

82
00:04:59,037 --> 00:05:01,747
This increases the number of measurements,

83
00:05:01,757 --> 00:05:03,989
and, to give you an idea,

84
00:05:04,959 --> 00:05:08,501
if you want to reduce the dimensions
for voxels by the factor of 2--

85
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,389
2 in everyone of the dimensions--

86
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:15,334
so it's your voxel size
that reduces the size by <i>8</i>,

87
00:05:16,163 --> 00:05:17,492
and you want to increase,

88
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:19,503
to compensate for this reduction in signal

89
00:05:19,504 --> 00:05:21,283
with the smaller voxel that you have

90
00:05:21,284 --> 00:05:24,163
by increasing the signal-to-noise
by a factor of <i>8</i>,

91
00:05:24,167 --> 00:05:26,203
the square root of law tells you

92
00:05:26,204 --> 00:05:29,934
that you have to increase
the measurement time by factor of <i>64</i>.

93
00:05:30,717 --> 00:05:34,717
So we go from a 2 mm resolution image
to a 1 mm resolution image,

94
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:38,561
3D means we go
from a 1 min measurement, for example,

95
00:05:38,562 --> 00:05:41,402
to a 64 min measurement,
or one hour.

96
00:05:42,002 --> 00:05:45,912
Can you imagine that this is
very uncomfortable?

97
00:05:46,809 --> 00:05:48,568
So now, second question was,

98
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:50,914
"How can we optimize
the contrast-to-noise ratio?"

99
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:53,197
And here for the purpose of this course

100
00:05:53,317 --> 00:05:58,127
I will introduce a concept
that is very important,

101
00:05:58,965 --> 00:06:01,574
and we will make repeated use
of this approach

102
00:06:01,575 --> 00:06:04,715
that I will be demonstrating here.

103
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:08,779
So, how do we optimize contrast?

104
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:13,950
So we want optimize the ability
to distinguish between two tissue types.

105
00:06:14,763 --> 00:06:16,732
So we want to optimize here

106
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:19,683
the experimental parameters
of our imaging modality

107
00:06:20,415 --> 00:06:23,785
to maximize difference
between, say, signals <i>S_1</i> and <i>S_2</i>.

108
00:06:24,697 --> 00:06:29,570
This is typically a complex
and empirical procedure, not very easy.

109
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:34,738
Sometimes we can actually
deduce some useful information,

110
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:37,496
if the signal behavior can be modeled.

111
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,556
Unfortunately we have many situations

112
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:43,336
where we can't put a reasonable model
of signal behavior

113
00:06:43,337 --> 00:06:47,227
to estimate the optimal
contrast-to-noise ratio.

114
00:06:48,245 --> 00:06:51,655
And here what we will use is
error propagation calculation.

115
00:06:52,013 --> 00:06:55,792
We will look at a procedure now,

116
00:06:55,793 --> 00:06:57,712
and this is very important procedure.

117
00:06:57,713 --> 00:07:02,543
We will look at this procedure
to optimize the contrast-to-noise ratio.

118
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:07,870
The approach here
consists of the following.

119
00:07:07,871 --> 00:07:11,031
Let's assume we have the signal,
or the measurement variable <i>S</i>.

120
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:15,790
And we will assume here it's a function
of two variables, <i>k</i> and <i>t</i>.

121
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,577
It does not matter what they are.

122
00:07:18,047 --> 00:07:20,377
We can imagine certain things.

123
00:07:20,457 --> 00:07:22,847
Let's say <i>k</i> is a tissue property.

124
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:25,906
That's what we impose:
<i>k</i> is a tissue property--that's important,

125
00:07:26,226 --> 00:07:29,046
and that's a decay rate--
it's something that is decaying.

126
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:32,347
And let's say <i>t</i>
is an experimental parameter.

127
00:07:32,467 --> 00:07:35,110
That is something
that I as an operate, I can change

128
00:07:35,111 --> 00:07:37,541
I can manipulate that parameter.

129
00:07:39,141 --> 00:07:43,318
And here, for example, it could be time--
when we measure, for example.

130
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,769
So we have decay rate
and measurement time.

131
00:07:47,296 --> 00:07:51,206
Now, the approach of finding
the best contrast-to-noise ratio

132
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:57,221
consists first in calculating
by how much does the signal change

133
00:07:57,229 --> 00:07:59,429
if the tissue property changes.

134
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:03,138
That is, we do nothing else
than take the derivative of a signal

135
00:08:03,139 --> 00:08:05,739
with respect to the tissue property <i>k</i>.

136
00:08:06,407 --> 00:08:09,678
That gives us a measure
by how much the signal changes

137
00:08:09,679 --> 00:08:12,548
if we change the tissue property <i>k</i>.

138
00:08:12,549 --> 00:08:14,508
We cannot of course
change the tissue property <i>k</i>,

139
00:08:14,509 --> 00:08:16,067
but in the end, we are asking

140
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:18,538
is if we have a range
of different tissue properties,

141
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,638
and where are the imaging techniques
most sensitive

142
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,199
to chain differences in tissue property,
here, what we call <i>k</i>.

143
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:30,958
So we'll take this function
that we defined here,

144
00:08:30,959 --> 00:08:33,501
and we calculate <i>dS / dk</i>.

145
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:35,416
That's a sensitivity of our measurement

146
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:38,525
to changes in tissue properties.

147
00:08:38,788 --> 00:08:42,051
And then we want to find out
where is it maximal,

148
00:08:42,052 --> 00:08:44,541
because if you know
that the signal change is maximal

149
00:08:47,550 --> 00:08:49,819
with respect to tissue property <i>k</i>

150
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:53,679
then we know we have
the best possible contrast-to-noise ratio.

151
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,989
And to to find out maximum,
we take standard calculus here.

152
00:08:57,990 --> 00:09:03,019
For the maximum we'll take
the derivative of <i>dS / dk</i>,

153
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,390
this function with respect to <i>t</i>,
the experimental parameter.

154
00:09:06,663 --> 00:09:11,640
So first I am asking
how does the signal change maximum

155
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:13,220
with respect to tissue parameter.

156
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,961
Then I have to find with respect
to the experimental parameter, here <i>t</i>,

157
00:09:16,968 --> 00:09:20,348
where is that change maximal,

158
00:09:21,112 --> 00:09:23,361
and we just have to do
by taking the derivative.

159
00:09:23,481 --> 00:09:26,611
Then we have just to verify
that we indeed have found the maximum.

160
00:09:27,545 --> 00:09:29,294
So let's take an example here.

161
00:09:29,295 --> 00:09:31,754
It's actually a fairly
ubiquitous function,

162
00:09:31,755 --> 00:09:35,085
and we'll say our signal
as function of tissue parameter <i>k</i>

163
00:09:35,237 --> 00:09:36,866
and experimental parameter <i>t</i>

164
00:09:36,876 --> 00:09:41,126
is given by S_0, a constant,
times <i>e</i> to the <i>- k t</i>.

165
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,606
That's a very simple model.

166
00:09:46,316 --> 00:09:52,046
So where is this signal
maximally dependent,

167
00:09:52,713 --> 00:09:56,833
the changes in <i>k</i>, where do they produce
the biggest changes in signal?

168
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:00,291
Look at this function and think about it.

169
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,751
If we take...

170
00:10:04,077 --> 00:10:05,566
Let's just go ahead here.

171
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:09,207
I will take the derivative of a signal
with respect to <i>k</i>.

172
00:10:10,785 --> 00:10:13,996
So the constant is zero.

173
00:10:13,997 --> 00:10:18,606
We have the internal derivative <i>t</i>
and <i>(e to the - k t)</i>.

174
00:10:18,607 --> 00:10:22,317
So, remember, we derive with respect to <i>k</i>.

175
00:10:23,841 --> 00:10:27,055
If we look at this function,
this function tells us

176
00:10:27,056 --> 00:10:31,527
at what point is this function
most sensitive

177
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:35,488
to what extent is it sensitive
to changes in a tissue parameter <i>k</i>.

178
00:10:37,055 --> 00:10:40,804
If we look at this parameter <i>t</i>

179
00:10:40,805 --> 00:10:45,180
where I want to find the maximum <i>t</i>,
where this is maximum

180
00:10:45,181 --> 00:10:47,721
I can already deduce some behavior.

181
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:52,091
If I let go <i>t</i> to infinity--
so I measure at very long times--

182
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:56,783
then <i>(e to the - k t)</i>
goes to zero much faster

183
00:10:56,784 --> 00:10:58,893
than <i>t</i> goes to infinity.

184
00:10:58,894 --> 00:11:04,454
So <i>t (e to the - k t)</i> goes to zero
for <i>t</i> going to infinity.

185
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:06,292
So we have at that point:

186
00:11:06,293 --> 00:11:11,222
our signal is completely not sensitive
to different <i>k</i>-s.

187
00:11:11,223 --> 00:11:15,029
This is, in other words,
saying here, at <i>k t</i> vs. infinity

188
00:11:15,030 --> 00:11:17,900
this is a zero, no matter what the <i>k</i> is.

189
00:11:18,786 --> 00:11:21,606
On the other hand, if I choose <i>t = 0</i>,

190
00:11:22,173 --> 00:11:24,053
this function here is <i>0</i>.

191
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:27,660
<i>0</i> times <i>e</i> to <i>- 0</i> is <i>0</i>.

192
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:33,622
The function actually, it turns out,
at <i>t = 0</i> equals to <i>S_0</i>.

193
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:39,002
So it's <i>S_0</i>, no matter what the <i>k</i> is,

194
00:11:39,003 --> 00:11:44,133
so I have no ability to distinguish
the tissue parameter <i>k</i> at time <i>0</i>.

195
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:47,706
So neither at time <i>0</i> nor at time infinity

196
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,596
do I have an ability
to discriminate two tissues

197
00:11:51,597 --> 00:11:53,557
based on the parameter <i>k</i>.

198
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:57,267
So now we want to find the maximum,

199
00:11:57,268 --> 00:11:59,709
so we will take the derivative
of this function here

200
00:11:59,917 --> 00:12:02,625
with respect to <i>t</i> and set in to <i>0</i>.

201
00:12:02,626 --> 00:12:05,168
That's where we find an extremum,

202
00:12:06,187 --> 00:12:10,367
we'll do the derivative--
so that's standard derivation rules--

203
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:15,420
and then we can separate out
<i>S_0 e</i> to the (- k t),

204
00:12:15,421 --> 00:12:19,181
and we can see here we separate this out,
we have this term here.

205
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:20,695
This is never <i>0</i>.

206
00:12:20,696 --> 00:12:22,929
We want to set this equal to <i>0</i>

207
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:28,980
and to have this <i>0</i>, we have
to have the measurement at <i>t_0 = 1 / k</i>.

208
00:12:29,899 --> 00:12:33,338
So our ability to discriminate
the tissue parameter <i>k</i>

209
00:12:33,339 --> 00:12:37,178
based on the choice of <i>t</i>

210
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:39,458
is maximal if we choose <i>t</i>--

211
00:12:39,459 --> 00:12:41,178
the measurement variable here

212
00:12:41,179 --> 00:12:45,302
so that is equal to <i>1</i>
over the decay rate of our signal

213
00:12:45,303 --> 00:12:47,153
in this particular model.

214
00:12:48,303 --> 00:12:50,732
This is fairly ubiquitous, like I said,

215
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:54,502
and so the conclusion is:
for an exponentially decaying signal

216
00:12:54,503 --> 00:12:58,433
your optimal time of measurement
is equal to <i>1</i> over the decay rate.

217
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,980
That is the best result in this case.

218
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:07,524
Now, let's say, we have two tissues,
but two different <i>k</i>-s.

219
00:13:07,724 --> 00:13:10,874
So we are getting
two different optimal <i>t_0</i>-s,

220
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,855
two different optimal measurements.

221
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:18,025
So we no longer can have
the best contrast-to-noise ratio

222
00:13:18,404 --> 00:13:21,004
for both tissues,
and we have to find a compromise.

223
00:13:21,464 --> 00:13:23,024
How do we find a compromise?

224
00:13:24,054 --> 00:13:27,314
We can calculate it,
or we can also ask ourselves,

225
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:31,297
are we willing to sacrifice
a certain percentage

226
00:13:31,298 --> 00:13:33,587
of the optimal contrast-to-noise ratio,

227
00:13:33,588 --> 00:13:35,588
that is, the optimal sensitivity,

228
00:13:36,108 --> 00:13:39,028
and deviate a little bit?

229
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:43,876
So now we are going to look
at this function here

230
00:13:43,895 --> 00:13:45,564
which is plotted here.

231
00:13:45,565 --> 00:13:48,654
So this is just normalized,
so it has the maximum at value <i>1</i>,

232
00:13:48,655 --> 00:13:51,365
and on the x-axis
we plot the variable <i>k t</i>.

233
00:13:51,557 --> 00:13:55,007
So we are plotting this function
normalized to <i>1</i> at the maximum

234
00:13:55,021 --> 00:13:58,691
<i>k t = 1</i>, <i>t = 1 / k</i>.

235
00:13:59,431 --> 00:14:01,841
It's the function that we obtain here.

236
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:04,858
And luckily,
if we are willing to sacrifice

237
00:14:04,859 --> 00:14:08,328
a certain percentage
of a contrast-to-noise ratio,

238
00:14:08,329 --> 00:14:12,249
let's say, we are willing
to sacrifice 20% here.

239
00:14:13,524 --> 00:14:15,764
20% means we have

240
00:14:18,394 --> 00:14:19,753
repeated measurements.

241
00:14:19,754 --> 00:14:21,713
We have to go by the square root law.

242
00:14:21,714 --> 00:14:24,540
This means we have to scan 40% more--

243
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:29,630
we go from 1 minute to 1.5 - 2 minutes,
something like that.

244
00:14:29,631 --> 00:14:33,189
So this is not a huge penalty to pay.

245
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,800
And now look at this function here.

246
00:14:35,801 --> 00:14:39,260
If we are saying we are going to stay
within 80% of the maximum,

247
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,339
then we go from essentially <i>k t = 0.5</i>

248
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:45,690
to almost up to <i>k t = 2</i>.

249
00:14:46,517 --> 00:14:50,626
Roughly estimating here,
we are gaining actually a fourfold range

250
00:14:50,627 --> 00:14:53,067
in changes in the parameter <i>k</i>.

251
00:14:53,577 --> 00:14:55,796
This parameter can change

252
00:14:55,797 --> 00:14:59,477
and be still very close
to the optimal measurement conditions.

253
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:02,259
We should not be down here,
we should not be up here

254
00:15:02,260 --> 00:15:04,460
but if we are somewhere in this range

255
00:15:04,461 --> 00:15:08,120
the penalty to be away
from the optimal contrast-to-noise ratio

256
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:11,991
is not enormous,
and we can certainly live with that.

257
00:15:12,631 --> 00:15:17,560
So the choice of the exact
measurement variable, here <i>t</i>,

258
00:15:17,561 --> 00:15:18,979
is not critical.

259
00:15:20,249 --> 00:15:24,076
It does not have to match exactly <i>1 / k</i>,
and if we have two different tissues,

260
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:28,357
it is not so critical
if we are close to be optimum.

261
00:15:29,275 --> 00:15:31,344
This practically means,
if we have two different tissues

262
00:15:31,345 --> 00:15:32,804
with with two different <i>k</i>-s,

263
00:15:32,805 --> 00:15:37,122
then your <i>t_0</i> is somewhere
between <i>1 / k_1</i> and <i>1 / k_2</i>,

264
00:15:37,123 --> 00:15:39,356
somewhere between those two values.

265
00:15:39,357 --> 00:15:42,047
One can of course calculate that.

266
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:48,157
So here is the optimum 
in this [chart].
