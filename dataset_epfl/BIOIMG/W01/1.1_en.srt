1
00:00:04,342 --> 00:00:05,905
Let's look at these four images.

2
00:00:05,905 --> 00:00:07,465
What do they represent?

3
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:10,250
Are you familiar with them?

4
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:15,586
Look at the four images a little bit
and give it a thought.

5
00:00:15,586 --> 00:00:18,176
Maybe you recognize all of them,
are familiar with all of them?

6
00:00:18,876 --> 00:00:22,366
Maybe you have seen three,
or maybe just two?

7
00:00:23,499 --> 00:00:25,899
Or maybe you recognize one, 
you are familiar with one,

8
00:00:25,899 --> 00:00:29,165
or maybe you can't recognize all of them?

9
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:32,015
It's not critical.

10
00:00:32,165 --> 00:00:34,305
But let's look at these images 
what they are.

11
00:00:34,615 --> 00:00:39,725
Take the first one: this is actually 
the X-ray diffraction pattern of DNA

12
00:00:39,725 --> 00:00:41,475
taken by Rosalind Franklin.

13
00:00:41,915 --> 00:00:46,575
This data is an image of a molecule DNA,

14
00:00:46,874 --> 00:00:49,807
and this image was used 
by Watson and Crick

15
00:00:49,807 --> 00:00:55,747
to propose the double-stranded structure 
of the DNA helix, the helical structure.

16
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,351
So this is a representation 
of something inside the body

17
00:00:59,351 --> 00:01:00,751
by an image.

18
00:01:01,621 --> 00:01:03,301
Let's take this image here.

19
00:01:04,896 --> 00:01:08,006
This is actually a very well known image, 
very famous,

20
00:01:08,016 --> 00:01:09,806
taken in 1895.

21
00:01:09,806 --> 00:01:13,266
It is the hand of the wife 
of Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen.

22
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:20,264
It is befitting that Röntgen 
received the first Nobel Prize in Physics.

23
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:22,923
Röntgen is also the father 
of biomedical imaging.

24
00:01:22,923 --> 00:01:24,143
Think about it.

25
00:01:24,143 --> 00:01:28,145
First Nobel Prize in Physics awarded
to the father of biomedical imaging.

26
00:01:28,145 --> 00:01:31,605
It gives you some idea about 
the importance of biomedical imaging.

27
00:01:31,934 --> 00:01:35,914
Later on X-ray images, the X-ray technique
for computed tomography,

28
00:01:36,524 --> 00:01:40,404
Cormack and Hounsfield 
shared the Nobel Prize in 1979.

29
00:01:40,404 --> 00:01:43,163
We will talk about that technique 
in more details.

30
00:01:44,635 --> 00:01:46,745
Well, take this image of blood cells.

31
00:01:47,005 --> 00:01:52,695
This is the work of Ruska, 
who received the Nobel Prize in 1986

32
00:01:52,882 --> 00:01:55,252
for the development 
of electron microscopy.

33
00:01:56,296 --> 00:01:59,273
These are images 
done by an electron microscope

34
00:01:59,843 --> 00:02:01,863
from red blood cells.

35
00:02:02,463 --> 00:02:04,963
And last but not least, 
what you see down here,

36
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:08,011
that's an MRI of the head--
we can see the eyeballs here

37
00:02:08,011 --> 00:02:09,711
[inaudible].

38
00:02:09,861 --> 00:02:11,761
This is an MRI of a head.

39
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:14,091
For the development of MRI 
as an imaging technique,

40
00:02:14,091 --> 00:02:16,691
Lauterbur and Sir Peter Mansfield,

41
00:02:16,691 --> 00:02:18,381
the latter one a physicist,

42
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:23,321
received the Nobel Prize 
for Physiology and Medicine in 2003.

43
00:02:24,498 --> 00:02:26,768
Together, what these images illustrate

44
00:02:26,769 --> 00:02:31,026
is the importance of basic sciences, 
fundamental sciences, physical sciences

45
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,556
and engineering

46
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:35,274
in developing biomedical 
imaging technologies

47
00:02:35,274 --> 00:02:37,904
that are being so widely used today,

48
00:02:38,444 --> 00:02:41,434
such as in medical diagnosis and research.

49
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:45,758
I will start here with a definition 
of biomedical imaging

50
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:51,668
which is slightly different than 
what we might consider as imaging.

51
00:02:51,968 --> 00:02:55,118
Take, for example, this device here.

52
00:02:55,805 --> 00:02:59,715
We all are pretty familiar 
with smartphones;

53
00:02:59,715 --> 00:03:01,095
we take pictures with it.

54
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:03,185
That is taking a picture.

55
00:03:03,185 --> 00:03:06,725
Strictly speaking,
it's taking a picture of people,

56
00:03:06,725 --> 00:03:09,555
so those are life beings, 
so one could call it biomedical imaging.

57
00:03:09,555 --> 00:03:12,835
But that's not the biomedical imaging 
that we consider.

58
00:03:12,835 --> 00:03:14,411
That's taking pictures.

59
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:16,797
So we'll take here 
a more general definition

60
00:03:16,797 --> 00:03:19,467
of biomedical imaging, or bio-imaging,

61
00:03:20,037 --> 00:03:23,799
and it is a localized measurement

62
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:29,539
of a contrast generating 
biophysical process or effect

63
00:03:29,539 --> 00:03:33,299
in the body or organ of a living system.

64
00:03:33,543 --> 00:03:35,773
And we will constrain 
ourselves in this course

65
00:03:35,773 --> 00:03:39,213
to techniques that are capable 
of obtaining this information

66
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:41,803
from a live being,

67
00:03:41,803 --> 00:03:44,286
be it an animal, a plant or a human,

68
00:03:44,286 --> 00:03:48,956
but it has to be alive and not extracted.

69
00:03:49,966 --> 00:03:54,956
So, if we go on, then we have 
to turn here contrast generating.

70
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:56,456
So what is contrast?

71
00:03:56,456 --> 00:03:59,466
What do we understand 
under the term <i>contrast</i>?

72
00:04:01,649 --> 00:04:03,685
We all know what images are.

73
00:04:04,485 --> 00:04:10,005
Contrast is the ability to distinguish 
tissue features against noise.

74
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:15,753
In all techniques, imaging techniques 
or otherwise measurement techniques

75
00:04:15,753 --> 00:04:17,483
we have some level of noise.

76
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:22,908
We need to have enough contrast, that is,
features to distinguish different tissues

77
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:28,721
or the lesions against normal tissue,
against the noise background.

78
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:32,871
Then we can say something relevant 
about what's going on.

79
00:04:33,742 --> 00:04:36,481
So essentially contrast 
is difference in signal

80
00:04:36,481 --> 00:04:40,921
between the two types of tissues 
that one wishes to distinguish.

81
00:04:41,121 --> 00:04:44,581
Can we see a difference, 
then we have contrast.

82
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,461
In our classical images, 
such as the smartphone

83
00:04:47,461 --> 00:04:48,949
that you've just seen before,

84
00:04:48,949 --> 00:04:52,404
we have excellent contrast, 
so we can distinguish the features.

85
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:54,025
We can take a picture of you,

86
00:04:54,025 --> 00:04:57,335
and you are easily able 
to recognize different people.

87
00:04:58,685 --> 00:05:04,275
So in reality we don't have 
that much signal-to-noise ratio

88
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,709
as we have with cameras,

89
00:05:05,709 --> 00:05:07,509
so in reality for imaging techniques,

90
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:10,569
we have to deal 
with contrast-to-noise ratios

91
00:05:10,569 --> 00:05:13,139
or the contrast to noise 
has to be considered.

92
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,579
So this is the importance of contrast.

93
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:20,823
So now we would go 
to what is being measured,

94
00:05:21,183 --> 00:05:24,203
and here I want to introduce 
some useful definitions.

95
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:28,253
Typically when we take an image, 
a 2D image,

96
00:05:28,253 --> 00:05:31,223
it's <i>(n x m)</i> matrix of pixels.

97
00:05:31,426 --> 00:05:33,576
Where does the term <i>pixel</i> come from?

98
00:05:35,404 --> 00:05:40,824
Well, the term <i>pixel</i> is a condensed
version of the double word <i>picture element</i>

99
00:05:41,105 --> 00:05:44,843
so people thought it is too long to say 
when they talk about picture

100
00:05:44,843 --> 00:05:47,673
and then at some point 
defined it as pixel.

101
00:05:48,902 --> 00:05:54,232
Or we have a 3D image 
which is a <i>(k x n x m)</i> matrix of voxels.

102
00:05:54,902 --> 00:05:58,482
I'd guess for now you can figure out 
what are voxels.

103
00:05:58,878 --> 00:06:03,508
And, indeed, <i>voxel</i> is the short version 
of <i>volume element</i>.

104
00:06:06,878 --> 00:06:10,398
So these are some of the features 
that we measure.

105
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:13,651
Now, what is important 
for the imaging techniques

106
00:06:13,651 --> 00:06:19,261
is the contrast between either voxels 
for a 3D image or pixels.

107
00:06:19,755 --> 00:06:23,625
Typically in this course we are going 
to restrain ourselves to 2D images.

108
00:06:23,635 --> 00:06:27,277
We are going mainly if we mean voxels, 
we really talk about pixels.

109
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,467
We won't generalize the techniques
to 3D imaging.

110
00:06:31,467 --> 00:06:33,190
But what is important is,

111
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:36,510
we want to be able 
to distinguish tissue 1 from tissue 2,

112
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,480
say, in the neighboring voxel 
or pixel of the image.

113
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:45,163
Now, in theory there is nothing 
that prohibits us

114
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:47,858
from generating matrixes 
with infinite dimensions.

115
00:06:48,528 --> 00:06:51,588
We can have n, m, k for a 3D image--

116
00:06:51,588 --> 00:06:57,648
with technology we can make it 
as large as we want.

117
00:06:58,885 --> 00:07:03,015
But stop, there is a problem here.

118
00:07:03,015 --> 00:07:04,865
They just can't have it all.

119
00:07:05,595 --> 00:07:08,955
So, to rephrase it, 
is there a free lunch for imaging?

120
00:07:09,247 --> 00:07:13,327
And what we see is that no, there isn't.

121
00:07:13,678 --> 00:07:15,568
And the general principle is this:

122
00:07:16,268 --> 00:07:19,137
If we have here on this graphic

123
00:07:19,137 --> 00:07:22,437
we have good resolution on the left, 
poor resolution on the right.

124
00:07:23,606 --> 00:07:25,885
So we would like to have 
really excellent resolution.

125
00:07:25,885 --> 00:07:29,455
We can do that-- the techniques allow us 
to do it in principle.

126
00:07:29,647 --> 00:07:33,647
So we could have excellent resolution, 
that is, very small voxel dimensions.

127
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,898
The price that we pay is that in that end

128
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:41,038
we typically have 
poor sensitivity or contrast.

129
00:07:42,213 --> 00:07:44,423
If you want to have a lot of sensitivity,

130
00:07:44,423 --> 00:07:47,773
then usually you have 
to pay the price with resolution.

131
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:53,143
So it's this trade-off between resolution 
on the right side

132
00:07:53,674 --> 00:07:58,014
and sensitivity/contrast on the other side

133
00:07:58,673 --> 00:08:01,093
that are fighting against each other,

134
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:04,103
and depending on what we want 
to be able to discern,

135
00:08:04,103 --> 00:08:07,013
we are trading off one against the other.

136
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:11,863
And it's always this trade-off 
that stays with us,

137
00:08:11,863 --> 00:08:15,403
and that's inherent 
in all of the imaging techniques.

138
00:08:16,695 --> 00:08:18,575
So now comes the question.

139
00:08:19,045 --> 00:08:20,402
We've talked about contrast.

140
00:08:20,402 --> 00:08:21,792
Now comes the question:

141
00:08:21,792 --> 00:08:26,572
what is signal-to-noise ratio, SNR, 
and contrast-to-noise ratio?

142
00:08:26,572 --> 00:08:27,742
How do they differ?

143
00:08:27,742 --> 00:08:29,923
These are two very essential terms

144
00:08:29,923 --> 00:08:36,083
with which we characterize the precision 
or quality of an image

145
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:39,113
and the ability 
to distinguish tissue features.

146
00:08:40,972 --> 00:08:43,532
So now I think we are all in agreement

147
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:46,401
that if you don't have 
a good signal-to-noise ratio,

148
00:08:46,401 --> 00:08:48,211
it's pointless to continue.

149
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:51,835
If you just see noise, 
then your image just has noise,

150
00:08:51,835 --> 00:08:53,393
and you cannot see anything.

151
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:56,663
So you need a good signal-to-noise ratio.

152
00:08:56,663 --> 00:08:59,643
It is an essential, necessary condition.

153
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,990
Multifying here 
the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),

154
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,830
let's look at the signal,

155
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,660
or the measurement variable.

156
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,910
Sometimes it's not the direct signal 
that we've imaged,

157
00:09:11,910 --> 00:09:14,490
but it is a variable 
that's derived from the image,

158
00:09:15,667 --> 00:09:19,127
and we'll consider the standard deviation 
of its measurement.

159
00:09:20,132 --> 00:09:23,693
Standard deviation of the measurement 
of this signal or the measurement variable

160
00:09:23,693 --> 00:09:29,203
means typically it's the variation 
that's either determined experimentally--

161
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:31,471
Now, how can we do that?

162
00:09:32,311 --> 00:09:34,791
It's experimental determination.

163
00:09:37,106 --> 00:09:41,346
So, one way is to repeat 
the measurement many times

164
00:09:41,636 --> 00:09:44,616
and to see how much 
the same measurement varies over time.

165
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:47,982
This gives us an indication on a variance

166
00:09:47,982 --> 00:09:50,762
and therefore on <i>σ</i>, 
the standard deviation.

167
00:09:51,097 --> 00:09:52,308
In some techniques,

168
00:09:52,308 --> 00:09:56,348
we can actually quantitate 
the standard deviation of the measurement

169
00:09:56,348 --> 00:10:01,228
and do a calculation quantitatively 
for the SNR.

170
00:10:01,376 --> 00:10:03,317
That brings us 
to the first important definition

171
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:05,887
that the signal-to-noise ratio 
is the signal

172
00:10:05,887 --> 00:10:08,887
divided by the standard deviation 
of the noise.

173
00:10:08,887 --> 00:10:13,667
This gives us an idea of the variance.

174
00:10:14,895 --> 00:10:19,028
So therefore this is a means 
to estimate the precision

175
00:10:19,028 --> 00:10:21,528
with which the signal is measured,

176
00:10:21,758 --> 00:10:24,238
how much does it fluctuate scan to scan.

177
00:10:26,351 --> 00:10:31,891
So now, it is in principle possible 
to have outstanding signal-to-noise ratio

178
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,000
but very poor contrast-to-noise-ratio.

179
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:39,537
And you think of the situation.

180
00:10:41,424 --> 00:10:47,384
We'll take the camera here, 
and let's say we take a picture of you

181
00:10:47,384 --> 00:10:51,244
or of the lecture hall, 
or of some scene,

182
00:10:51,244 --> 00:10:53,980
and we take a very long exposure time.

183
00:10:54,189 --> 00:10:59,079
So in a CCD device 
we collect a lot of photons

184
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:03,909
until we saturate the detector 
of the camera.

185
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:06,370
Then we have 
excellent signal-to-noise ratio.

186
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:09,130
We basically have no noise, 
we have just signal,

187
00:11:09,130 --> 00:11:13,529
but when we saturate, we basically 
are overloading on all aspects.

188
00:11:13,529 --> 00:11:15,899
The camera is getting white image,

189
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:19,283
so this is an excellent SNR, 
signal-to-noise ratio,

190
00:11:19,283 --> 00:11:22,943
but we won't be able 
to discern any features with it.

191
00:11:22,943 --> 00:11:24,372
So we have no contrast.

192
00:11:24,372 --> 00:11:28,202
We can't see if there are people 
in the picture, if it is a landscape, etc.

193
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:32,104
So, while signal-to-noise ratio 
has to be good--

194
00:11:32,104 --> 00:11:36,724
it's a necessary condition, 
it is not a sufficient condition.

195
00:11:38,058 --> 00:11:42,318
So we need to be able 
to distinguish two signals--

196
00:11:43,048 --> 00:11:45,848
we call it, let's say, S_1 and S_2,

197
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:50,325
and we want to have for each one of them 
good signal to-noise ratio--

198
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:51,955
let's assume we have that--

199
00:11:51,955 --> 00:11:57,305
but we also need to introduce here 
the contrast-to-noise ratio.

200
00:11:57,562 --> 00:12:00,322
And this is the definition 
I want to bring in here about.

201
00:12:01,382 --> 00:12:04,702
So let's take S_1 and S_2.
Those are two signals

202
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:07,622
from two different tissues 
or measurement variables,

203
00:12:07,622 --> 00:12:10,439
again, it can be calculated, variables,
from the images,

204
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:15,899
but two features that we are extracting 
from the tissue,

205
00:12:16,132 --> 00:12:19,104
and, let's say, one and two 
are two different tissues.

206
00:12:19,854 --> 00:12:23,484
Here again the standard deviation 
like on the left here,

207
00:12:23,484 --> 00:12:27,274
for the signal-to-noise ratio,
here is the standard deviation,

208
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:32,729
and we'll introduce now for S_1 and S_2--
that's the standard deviation

209
00:12:32,729 --> 00:12:34,759
of those two tissues, of those two voxels

210
00:12:34,759 --> 00:12:39,809
that we want to distinguish 
have the same standard deviation,

211
00:12:39,809 --> 00:12:40,999
so <i>σ</i> the same,

212
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:43,496
and the noise 
is statistically independent.

213
00:12:43,496 --> 00:12:46,636
That's two statistically independent 
measurements.

214
00:12:46,636 --> 00:12:48,806
That's what we assume.

215
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:52,064
Then we define the contrast-to-noise ratio

216
00:12:52,064 --> 00:12:54,304
as the difference in the two signals

217
00:12:54,612 --> 00:12:58,492
divided by the standard deviation 
of the noise.

218
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:04,417
This means we have a signal 1, 
we have a signal 2.

219
00:13:05,346 --> 00:13:07,566
We have a standard deviation.
If those two signals

220
00:13:07,566 --> 00:13:12,846
differ by not much more 
than the standard deviation of the noise.

221
00:13:12,846 --> 00:13:15,726
We essentially cannot even mathematically

222
00:13:15,726 --> 00:13:19,986
discriminate between 
the two signals, S_1 and S_2.

223
00:13:19,986 --> 00:13:23,136
So we won't be able to discriminate 
between the two tissue types

224
00:13:23,143 --> 00:13:29,543
and not detect the lesion 
or not detect the different tissue types.

225
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,540
So this is a means 
to estimate the precision

226
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:38,590
by which we can detect changes 
in the signal between two tissues.
