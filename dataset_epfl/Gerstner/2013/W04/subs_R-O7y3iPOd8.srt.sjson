to this mathematical detour concerning the analysis of stability","of fixed points.","We have seen, in the previous lectures, that in the phase plane,","fixed points are characterized by their crossing points, the","intersection points between the two node clients.","And the question arises, for given fixed point, is it","stable or is it unstable?","Now, this can be analyzed mathematically in","a systematic fashion.","All those who know how to analyze the fixed points of differential equations","can skip this lecture.","For those who are not at ease with stability analysis, please, stay on","for the next few slides.","Before we go into the analysis of arbitrary non-linear differential","equations, let's look at the analysis of a linear differential equation.","In our nullcline picture, this would correspond to a","u-nullcline that is linear.","If I search for d/dt u equals 0 I find w equal a times u.","That means for this fixed point here, I would have a smaller then 0.","","And the fixed point is chosen such that the voltage is at","the fixed point 0.","w at the fixed point is 0.","","Now, with these kind of nullclines I can do the usual picture and say,","well, here I expect downward motion, leftward motion, rightward motion.","I would expect upward motion here and also upward motion there.","","Now, if I zoom in just on this little segment, my picture looks like this.","","And I claim that we can find the conditions that this is stable.","Stable means I start at some initial condition.","And then it will zoom in to the fixed point.","","Now suppose now, that I have a stimulus, I0, which is positive.","Then the nullcline would be shifted upwards.","And it would have a new situation.","Well, this is downward slope.","This is left.","This is Right And the old arrows are no longer valid.","","Well, actually, the picture looks very similar.","I also have this kind of rotational component.","However, we will find the conditions under which such a picture implies","instability of the fixed point.","If I start at this point here, [? the trajectory ?] will circle outwards.","It will go away from the fixed point.","You can imagine yet another scenario.","In this case, it doesn't have this rotational component.","Rather, in this direction, it's attracted towards the fixed point.","Whereas in the other direction it's going away from the fixed point.","That would be called a saddle.","Now, the picture with these linear red and blue lines looks rather","artificial.","However, it's not.","Because if you just zoom in locally in a region very close to the fixed point","we'll find that locally it looks like straight lines.","And then this would be a stable fixed point.","Whereas up here, locally, it looks like the case we had here, which is an","unstable fixed point.","And yet, there could also be these saddle points.","That's the overview.","Now, this zooming in corresponds to a mathematical operation that we will","discuss now.","So this is my arbitrary two-dimensional system of","differential equations.","The change of voltage, w, u is given by some function, F, which depends on","the two variables u and w.","And for the w variable, it also depends on the two variables, u and w.","","Now, at the fixed point I will have a certain relation.","At the fixed point, they note it at u0, w0.","There is no change of d/dt u.","","That means this right-hand side must be equal to 0.","At the fixed point there is no change of w.","That means the G function at the fixed point is evaluated to 0.","","Now, let's look in the close neighborhood of the fixed point.","The fixed point is at u0.","x is a small distance from u0.","y is a small distance from w0.","Now, let's look at the change of x.","I can write down a d/dt x is d/dt minus u0.","But u0 is a constant.","","So it's the same as d/dt u.","But d/dt u is F of u and w plus R times I0.","","Now, we said that we zoom in into the neighborhood of u0.","So I can write u as u0 plus x.","So I have here F of u0 plus x.","This is u.","Now, what about w?","w is w0 plus y.","So let's plug that in.","w0 plus y.","And I copy the rest.","x is small.","We stay in the neighborhood of u0.","F is assumed to be a very smooth function.","So we can do a Taylor expansion.","","The Taylor expansion gives the evaluation at u0, w0 F of u0, w0 plus","dF/du, the first derivative.","Evaluate it at u0, w0 times x plus dF/dw evaluated at u0, w0 times y.","","And then you need to add the plus R I0 over here.","","Now, let's look up here.","We said that at the fixed point F of u0, w0 plus R I0 adds up to 0.","So this term together with the R I0 term here adds up to 0.","So I have d/dt u equals dF/du evaluated at u0, w0 times x plus dF/dw","evaluated at u0 w0 times y.","","Now, this looks like an awkward notation.","Right?","I've had dF/du evaluated at--","that's the vertical line-- u0, w0.","Let's write this shorthand notation as Fu.","That's the first derivative of this function, F, with respect to u","evaluated at the fixed point, shorter, Fu.","Same thing here, Fw times y.","","So that was the Taylor expansion of this first equation.","I can do a similar Taylor expansion of the second equation.","And it will look very much the same.","So let's do this.","That's my Taylor expansion of the first equation.","","And from the second equation I get this Taylor expansion where this means","the derivative of the function G with respect to u evaluated at the fixed","point u0, w0, analogously for G sub w.","Now, I can introduce a vector, which is just x and y.","And then this set of two equations becomes one single vector equation.","This is the vector x.","","And this is a matrix of coefficients.","And the coefficients arise from the Taylor expansion of the functions F","and G.","So we have, now, a linear matrix equation.","And the question is whether x--","that's to the to small distance away from the fixed point.","The question is whether this x is going to increase.","So if I go down to one dimension, x as a function of time, this","distance, x from 0.","0 means I'm at the fixed point.","I'm a little bit away.","Now it could be that this distance, x, increases.","That's the case if the real part of lambda is positive.","Or it could be that I start at this value x.","But in fact, if I start a little bit away from the fixed point-- the fixed","point is at 0--","and I go back to the fixed point.","That corresponds to the case that this lambda, exponential approach and the","real part of lambda is smaller than 0.","","So this is the matrix equation.","Since we started with two differential equations we are in two dimensions.","This is a two-dimensional matrix.","And I have two solutions.","And they are characterized by eigenvalues lambda","plus and lambda minus.","","And if you search for this solution and you plug it into this equation you","find that the eigenvalues are related to these derivatives arising from the","Taylor expansion.","And we can sum up this in two conditions, condition A and B.","Now, stability requires that the real part of both eigenvalues be negative.","","So it could be that the eigenvalues are real.","In which case, I don't need to write down the real part of.","But it can also be that these eigenvalues are complex numbers.","Complex numbers means that lambda plus, for example, could","be some real part.","Let's call it lambda 0 plus some imaginary part, I omega.","OK, now, stability requires that both of these have negative real parts.","And I can combine this with my rules here.","And what I find is, I find conditions on my derivatives arising from the","Taylor expansions at the entries of this matrix here.","And these are the conditions.","Let's call this condition one and this here, condition two.","So if you want to check whether your system of two equations has a stable","fixed point you have to do a Taylor expansion around that fixed point.","And you have to check the coefficients of these Taylor expansion and see that","Fu plus Gw is smaller than 0 while this combination should","be larger than 0.","OK, now, we zoom in.","I have started some arbitrary two-dimensional system.","I zoom in on one fixed point, save this fixed point here.","And what I find is that this fixed point here, where u is now the","distance from the fixed point, this fixed point here is stable.","In fact, I have a real part lambda 0.","And the rotation corresponds to an imaginary part, I omega.","And lambda 0 is negative.","Which means we zoom into the fixed point.","","Any trajectory starting in the neighborhood of the fixed point will","converge with some quotation or component towards the fixed point.","","Now, let's look at the next situation, at the fixed point up here.","Again, this value, u, would be the distance from the fixed point.","If you do the analysis we find in this situation that it's unstable.","","It's unstable.","And again, the structure is plus minus I omega.","And the lambda 0 here is larger than 0.","Under the condition that this slope parameter a-- which corresponds","to the slope a--","is larger than some critical value ac.","That depends on the other parameters.","In particular, on the time constants.","","In the same way, we can also analyze the third pattern which is not here,","visible on the right-hand side.","And in this case, I have two real parts.","I have two real eigenvalues, lambda plus is positive.","And lambda minus is negative.","The negative eigenvalue corresponds to the attraction towards the fixed","point, whereas the positive eigenvalue corresponds to the divergence of the","fixed point here in the vertical direction.","So we have the scenario of a stable fixed point with","a rotational component.","Of a saddle point and of an unstable fixed point with","a rotational component.","To summarize, if you have a two-dimensional system of equations","you have to go towards the fixed point, do a Taylor expansion in the","neighborhood of the fixed point, look at the coefficients","of the Taylor expansion.","Write them into a matrix.","Do an analysis of that matrix in terms of eigenvalues.","Stability of the fixed point means that both eigenvalues have negative","real parts.","","If you are not in two dimensions but in higher dimensions, the same type of","analysis applies.","Again, you have to look at the eigenvalues of the","corresponding matrix.","With this, I would like to close my review of stability","analysis of fixed points.","I hope this little review is useful for you in order to analyze the","stability of the fixed points that we have for neuron models, which we are","interested in.",""],"paragraphs":[0,4450,32049,70310,114170,144140,170870,194530,224050,243080,261690,277150,317760,342510,369750,401170,426110,441920,449620,504250,556030,592030,604230,635820,667050,685190,715330,747750,760560,789370,822040,842420,868110,894720,909810,932980,961560,981160,1017460,1037069,1063770,1089960,1112350]}
