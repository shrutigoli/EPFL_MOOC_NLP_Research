to week four of the class Neural Dynamics.","In the previous two weeks, we have developed rather detailed biophysical","neuron models.","We started off with models of the Hodgkin-Huxley type with","different ion channels.","Last week, we added synapses and added dendrites.","So, if you look at one of these detailed models, it has a rather","complicated structure.","There are maybe 75 different ion channel types.","There might be many different ion channels distributed across the","dendrite with many, many compartments.","And such a detailed neuron model is indeed capable of reproducing many","phenomena of real neurons.","However, the aim of a model is to understand what's going on in nature,","to describe natural phenomena.","If the neuron model itself is so complicated it becomes hard to","understand it, then the question arises, what can we do?","Is it possible to arrive at a simplified description which is easier","to understand, where we can grasp the essence of phenomena, where we can","develop mathematical tools to really analyze what's going on?","And that's the topic for this week.","So, last week we looked at detailed neuron models.","For example, we made a model of such a pyramidal neuron in cortex.","Now, such a parietal neuron has a rich dendritic structure.","And we have seen last week that there are active processes in a dendrite","that give rise to a ping pong between back-propagating action potentials","generated in the soma and dendritic spikes.","Now, these active processes exist.","The question arises whether these and other neurons would show such active","ping pong-like processing in an in vivo situation, if the neuron is","embedded in a real brain, involved in a real processing task, sensory","processing, memory retrieval.","Are these active processes important?","We don't really know.","Other neurons might not have these active processes at all.","If you assume that the dendrite is passive, then indeed, the main","function of the dendrite is to provide a filtering.","Signals that arrive in the upper branches of the dendrite give rise to","a filtered input at the soma.","But all the decisions about generating the action potential or not are taken","at the soma.","And in this case, in the case of a passive or mainly passive dendrite,","it's possible to reduce the description to that of a","point neuron model.","Now, even a Hodgkin-Huxley type point neuron model may have many different","ion channels embedded in the membrane.","And these ion channels open and close depending on the state of the","environment.","Now, with 75 different ion channel types, such a model is still a rather","complicated model.","Ion pumps and ion channels give rise to complicated behavior.","As we have seen, ion pumps gives rise to a difference in voltage via a","concentration difference.","And this, in the end, gives rise to the reversal potential.","Ion channels can be described by their conductances.","And these conductances--","for example, a conductance for the sodium channel or the potassium","channel or the leak channel--","the conductance of a sodium channel depends on these gating variables,","like m and h.","And each of these gating variables has a complicated dynamics.","m likes to go towards m0, with some time constant tau m.","h likes to go towards h0, with some time content tau h.","And n, for the potassium current, n likes to go towards n0, with some time","constant tau n.","Now, I say \"time constant tau n,\" but it's not really a constant because","this time constant depends on the voltage u.","Similarly, the target value, or equilibrium value, depends on the","voltage u that's presently valid in the membrane.","So, with three different types of ions, sodium, potassium, and leak, one","type of ion channel for each type of ion, we have already four","differential equations.","We can also say we have a four dimensional system of","differential equations.","","Now, four dimensional differential equations are still rather","complicated.","It's not easy to understand the dynamics in such high dimensions, and","four is a big number in that context.","So, how can we understand the dynamics of the Hodgkin-Huxley model given that","it's formulated in four dimensions?","How can it be that some Hodgkin-Huxley models show a smooth f-i curve, of the","type one, others show a jumpy f-i curve, which means type two, with just","a small change of parameters?","Can we understand these different types of neuron model?","Can we understand the threshold behavior?","When does the model will send out a spike?","When does it not respond with a spike?","Well, all of these phenomena can be understood if you reduce the system","from four to two equations.","And that's the aim for this first lecture.","","Now, in order to go from four dimensions to two, you have to use two","mathematical tools, two mathematical tricks.","And the first one is the separation of time scale.","So, here are the four equations of the Hodgkin-Huxley model in their full","beauty, written out.","There's a voltage equation.","And there's the equation of the variable m, which enters into the","sodium channel.","There's an equation for the variable h, which also enters","into the sodium channel.","And then there's a variable n, which controls the potassium channel.","","m likes to go towards m0, its equilibrium value, with some time","constant tau m.","h likes to go towards its equilibrium value with some time constant tau h.","No, these time constants, as I mentioned","before, are voltage dependent.","And the first observation we make is that the time constant for m is much,","much shorter, it's smaller, than that for h.","It's also smaller than that for n.","So in that sense, m is fast.","So if, for the moment, we assume that the stimulus is some constant drive,","then the whole dynamics is controlled by the interaction between the voltage","variable, the gating variable m, the gating variable h, the","gating variable n.","Now, the m variable reacts with the time constant tau m, which is small,","to changes in the voltage.","Tau m is much smaller than all the other time constants in the system.","And therefore, we can say m is a fast variable.","It's faster than the others.","And m approaches its value--","m likes to go towards m0 with a time constant tau m.","And tau m is short, so m sort of goes instantaneously towards m0.","That means at any moment in time, we can imagine that m has already","approached its value m0 for the momentary voltage u.","So, this is the idea of separation of time scale.","One of the variables is fast, or a group of variables are fast, and these","fast variables have already approached their instantaneous equilibrium value.","The details of this argument will be given in the next lecture.","So, the dynamics of m are fast.","Now, the second observation is that the dynamics of h and n are sort of of","similar speed.","If I compare tau n here, some hand-drawn trigger, with tau h, it's","not the same.","But it's roughly in the same range.","","n approaches n0, and h approaches h0.","And both do that with a time constant which is similar. tau h","and tau n are similar.","Now, obviously the curves, the equilibrium curves for n0 and for h0","are not similar at all.","However, they are sort of a mirror image of each other.","Suppose I'm here at a resting value of the voltage.","There is no external current.","The system has equilibrated.","And at this resting state, n has a certain value and h","has a certain value.","Now, while n goes up, h will go down.","So, they behave one in a mirror image of the other.","And while h gets small, n gets big.","Or, while n gets small, h gets big.","If you compare the value here--","that's the momentary value of n--","with the value 1 minus h, then they are sort of similar to each other, not","perfectly similar.","That's why I've put an arbitrary constant a, a scaling constant,","between the two.","So here's, again, the same kind of picture, but during","constant current injection.","The current injection starts here at time 20 milliseconds.","And you see that n of t increases periodically during the spikes.","And, at the same moment, h of t decreases.","So the two curves form mirror images.","The dynamics of the two is sort of similar.","And that's what we have expressed by this equation here.","The details of the argument will be given in the third lecture.","But let's put these insights together.","So, the Hodgkin-Huxley model has a sodium current.","It's controlled by the momentary value, m of t of the gating variable m","and by the momentary value of the gating variable h.","The potassium current is controlled by the momentary value of the gating","variable n.","I stress momentary value, and that's why I've written explicitly n of t.","This is one of the variables.","","Other variables are u of t.","And then there's an external input which can be","constant or time dependent.","Now, we said the dynamics of m are fast, so m can be replaced by its","momentary value, m0.","So, I put that in, m0 of u of t.","","Now, before, m was an independent variable.","Now, m0 of u is just a readout of a look up table, m0 of u evaluated at","the momentary value u of t.","","And then, m goes to the third power.","","Now, the dynamics of h and n are similar.","And so, both, I will introduce a new variable.","1 minus h will be written as w.","a times n will be written as w.","","So, 1 minus h is equal to w, then h is 1 minus w.","And that's what I put in here, 1 minus w of t.","","And then I copy u of t minus Ena.","","Now, n.","a times n is w, so n is w/a.","Let's insert this in here, w of t over a constant a to the power of 4.","u of t minus Ek.","And the rest does not change.","I can copy it. u of t minus El plus I of t.","Let's rewrite this like a voltage equation.","This is the voltage variable.","","And the voltage variable appears here.","On the right hand side, it appears here.","It appears here.","And it appears there.","This is my first variable.","And then I have a second variable.","The secondary level is w.","It appears here.","And it appears here.","And that's it in terms of variables.","We started off with four variables, m, h, n, and the voltage u.","We end up with two variables, one for the voltage and one for w.","","Now, each of the gating variables, n and h, had an equation.","n likes to go towards n0.","h likes to go towards h0.","And so, it's not surprising that there should be some dynamics for this new","variable w.","w likes to go towards w0 with some effective time constant, which itself","is voltage dependent.","So I have here my voltage equation.","And here I have my w equation.","","And together they form a two dimensional system of equations, some","function on the right hand side of the momentary voltage, the momentary w.","Again, here is the voltage.","Here is the voltage.","Here is the voltage.","Here is the voltage.","Here is w, and here is w.","And the w equation is also--","it depends on the voltage.","Here is the voltage.","And it depends on w.","Here is w.","So, we have a two dimensional system of equations as a result.","So, let me summarize what we have seen.","Exploiting the difference of time scales, we can use the mathematical","trick, separation of time scales, so as to replace the m variable by its","instantaneous value.","Moreover, w represents an effective variable.","And that w variable exploits the similarities in the dynamics","between h and n.","As a result, a four dimensional system of equations has been reduced to two","dimensions.","As we will see in the following, two dimensional systems of","equations are beautiful.","They are nice.","They are nice because you can use graphical tools to analyze the system.","You can understand the difference between a type one and a type two","neuron model.","You can understand threshold behaviors.","You can understand repetitive firing.","So, once you are in two dimensions, you have an immense amount of tools","available in order for you to understand the dynamics of action","potential generation in neurons.","Before we continue, please have a look at our
