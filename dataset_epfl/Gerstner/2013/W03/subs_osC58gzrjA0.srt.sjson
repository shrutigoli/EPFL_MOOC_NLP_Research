to week three of the class Neuronal Dynamics.","Last week, we talked about the model of Hodgkin-Huxley.","This week, we will add more detail.","Just as in the previous weeks, we'll focus on a single neuron, an isolated","neuron, that may be part of the network of neurons in cortex.","Last week, we talked about a biophysical model of the type of","Hodgkin and Huxley that included different types of ion channels.","However, the neuron was just a point.","The neuron did not have any spatial structure.","It was a point neuron.","Now, real neurons have dendrites.","Dendrites have a complicated spatial structure.","And so, the natural question is to ask, what is happening in a dendrite?","Is there any function?","What's the role of the dendrite?","That's the first point.","The second shortcoming of the model of last week was that input was injected","explicitly in the form of stimulating current.","You can imagine that the experimentalist injects such a current","through an electrode.","However, this is not a natural situation.","A neuron embedded in a network would receive input from other neurons.","And this input would arrive in the form of spikes that arrive at the","synapse and cause some response on the postsynaptic side.","So the second point I would like to raise this week is, what happens at","the synapse?","Can we describe the activity of a synapse?","And it's with this second point that I would like to start.","I would like to start with a discussion of synapses.","So here is a zoom onto one synapse.","And for the following discussion, let's just focus","on this zoomed synapse.","And to facilitate the discussion, I would like to turn it","around by 90 degrees.","And then this is what you'll see.","So here on the top part, this is the presynaptic terminal.","Inside the terminal, you'll find vesicles.","Vesicles are loaded with neurotransmitters.","Some sit inside.","Some sit on the surface.","Now suppose a signal arrives from the presynaptic neuron.","The signal would be one of the action potentials that","travels along the axon.","The axon bifurcates, spreads out, has various ramifications.","And one of these ramifications ends at this presynaptic terminal.","At the moment when the spike arrives, some of the vesicles fuse with the","membrane and eject neurotransmitters into the synaptic cleft.","These transmitter molecules are then captured by the channels.","So the channels have sensors that can pick up one of these molecules.","And if one of the molecules is captured, then the channel opens, and","sodium ions can flow inside the cell.","Potassium ions can flow out of the cell.","An important neurotransmitter is glutamate.","In fact, this is the most important transmitter at excitatory synapses.","","One of the excitatory channels is the so-called AMPA channel.","If it opens, it makes a thin channel wide enough for sodium and potassium","to pass through, but not wide enough for calcium.","There's another type of channel on excitatory synapses that's the","so-called NMDA channel.","If it's open, then calcium can pass through.","The dynamics of an NMDA is slower than that of the AMPA channel.","Excitatory synapses are not the only ones.","There are also inhibitory synapses.","Inhibitory synapses use the neurotransmitter GABA.","And it comes in two subtypes--","GABA A and GABA B.","So here is a model picture of the different synaptic currents caused by","neurotransmitter release.","So suppose a spike arrives at the synapse at time 0.","If it's an excitatory synapse with many AMPA channels, then you would see","a very rapid rise, and it decays within a few milliseconds.","If the channel also contains NMDA, then the synaptic current through the","NMDA channels would be much slower, and it extends over about 100","milliseconds or so.","And inhibitory synapses, there are the two channels subtypes, GABA A and GABA","B. And one is fast.","The other one is slow.","So this is the effective current that flows into the cell if a spike arrives","at the presynaptic terminal.","One of the questions we need to ask is, how can we","described such a current?","Can we build a model of such a current?","And now we have seen the Hodgkin-Huxley model, that an","important notion is the synaptic conductance.","So let's build this type of model now.","The total synaptic current has a drive which is the difference between the","momentary voltage and the reversal potential.","","And the index syn indicates it's the reversal the potential of the synapse.","Now, the conductance is time-dependent, because the channel","opens if neurotransmitter molecules are bound.","And afterwards, it closes again.","A very simple model is to say this time dependence is just","an exponential pulse.","That's the kind of model we have here for the AMPA--","immediate rise, rapid fall afterwards, with some time constant tau for AMPA","in the range of a few milliseconds.","","So suppose a spike arrives here.","We have this jump upwards.","This says a spike arrives at time tk.","The effect of the spike can only be felt after tk at times","t larger than tk.","So this is just a heavy side step function which jumps from 0 to 1 at 0.","So for t smaller than tk, I have no effect.","For t larger than tk, it's just 1.","So essentially, this means the exponential curve here starts at time","tk and then decays with the time constant tau.","So this is what we have plotted over there.","Now, suppose we have many spikes, spikes arriving at","different moments in time.","Then the first spike would cause this response.","The second spike would cause another response that adds to the first one.","A third spike would cause yet another response, the fourth and","fifth spike as well.","So the total synaptic conductance is the sum of all these different","contributions, the sum of all the different firing times tk.","","And it's this total synaptic conductance that's inserted here into","the equation, multiplied with the drive.","And this gives the synaptic current.","","Now, a slightly more complicated model would be to say, well, there's not","just this decay time, but there's also a rise time.","So a spike comes in here.","It has some rise time.","And then we decay with the time consent tau.","So the rise time corresponds roughly to the time it takes to","take off from 0.","Now, this current, again, if there are several spikes, would just add up to","what I've plotted here as the total conductance.","And this total conductance is inserted in the current equation.","Now, the current equation could, for example, go into the","Hodgkin-Huxley model.","And now there are two different interpretations to do this.","One would be to say the total stimulating current is this current","here with the minus sign.","And that's why we have plotted this here.","So excitatory synapses with AMPA channels or NMDA channels effectively","are equivalent to a positive stimulating current.","","A different point of view is to say, well, in a real neuron, there is no","stimulating current.","Rather, there are channels.","This is the sodium channel.","This is the potassium channel.","This is the [INAUDIBLE] channel.","And then this here is an additional channel that would naturally have the","minus sign.","So this is a simple model of synaptic current.","So let me summarize.","So we have the neurotransmitter glutamate at excitatory synapses.","We have the neurotransmitter GABA at inhibitory synapses.","And both are described by the same kind of equation.","However, there's a difference, because the reversal potential at excitatory","synapses is high, whereas the reversal potential at","inhibitory synapses is low.","Now, what's the result of this difference in the reversal potential?","So let's look at the following graph.","Suppose this is about the resting potential.","So the membrane potential is fluctuating here.","","Now, if the voltage is about the resting potential, which is maybe","minus 70 millivolts, then this drive here, minus 70 minus 0, means minus","70, multiplied with the minus sign here gives you a big","positive driving current.","So if a pulse comes in it gives this response to the membrane potential.","Now, if the membrane potential momentarily is higher, like here, then","this might be minus 60 millivolts.","Well, the drive is about the same.","","The difference between minus 60 and minus 70 is not that big.","So the size of the response is roughly the same.","Not so at inhibitory synapses.","Suppose now I have an inhibitory pulse coming in here.","My current value is minus 60 millivolts.","","I put in here minus 70 or minus 75.","So the total difference is about 50 millivolts.","And this is the driving force that's going to multiply the synaptic","conductance.","And so this gives this kind of response.","However, if, at the moment when the inhibitory spike arrives, if, at the","moment when the spike arrives at the inhibitory synapse, the membrane","potential is roughly at rest, then the driving force, minus 70 minus minus","75, is only about a third of what it was before.","So the same spike will have a much smaller effect at the inhibitory","synapses if the neuron is at rest.","In fact, if the neuron is exactly at the reversal potential, then the","driving force is 0.","","This is called shunting inhibition.","","The inhibition drives the membrane potential towards the synaptic","reversal potential.","But if the membrane potential is already close to the synaptic reversal","potential, the effect of inhibition is not visible in voltage trace.","It's just visible as a change in the conductance.","So synapses are important contact points between neurons.","They are important for signal transmission.","If a spike arrives at the presynaptic terminal, a","neurotransmitter is emitted.","It's captured by the receptors on the postsynaptic side.","If it's captured, then the channel opens, which eventually leads to a","change in conductance and to an input current into the neuron.","And this input current can be described with a","simple modeling approach.","Before we go on to Part Two, please have a look at the quiz that we have","prepared for you.",""],"paragraphs":[0,4690,25660,44960,63736,101950,119470,136705,155360,198490,219600,251750,266590,280966,323470,345850,389300,426710,458850,481570,505650,530919,555560,576790,608010,636020,664460,723360,756030,795570,833380,871650,907020]}
