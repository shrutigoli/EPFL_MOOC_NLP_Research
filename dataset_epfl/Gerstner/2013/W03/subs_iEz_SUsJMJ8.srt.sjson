to Part 2 of Week 3.","So what is short-term synaptic plasticity?","If a spike is sent off from a neuron and received at the post-synaptic","neuron, it causes some effect.","Effect be described as a change in the synaptic conductance, which gives rise","to a stimulating current.","If you simplify that picture and say essentially at the dendrite it's a","positive membrane, you can write down the positive membrane equation and","find that there's a change in the potential of the post-synaptic cell.","An incoming spike causes a post-synaptic potential.","You can measure this post-synaptic potential or you can measure the","post-synaptic current.","And what you find is that increases, goes through a maximum, and then","decays back.","Now, the strength of the synapse is related to the amplitude of this","post-synaptic response.","Importantly for the following, this strength is not fixed.","Rather, it can change.","Synapses can change their strength.","Synapses are plastic.","And this has been known for quite a long time.","How can you see these changes of synaptic strength?","Well, a famous protocol is to inject a sequence of short pulses into a","pre-synaptic neuron so that this pre-synaptic neuron fires, for","example, eight action potentials, which travel along the dendrite,","arrive at the synapse, and cause a response measured in the","post-synaptic cell.","Now, the first spike arrives here, and it causes a big response.","A second spike arrives, it causes a much smaller response.","The third spike, fourth spike, all of the subsequent responses are weaker.","The synapse becomes depressed.","","So this is a synapse with depressive behavior, a depressing synapse.","Now, if we wait about 500 milliseconds and give another spike, then you see","that the synapse has recovered.","It's nearly back to its original value.","The strength is nearly back to its original value.","So how could we model the observed effects of synaptic depression?","As we have seen in Part 1 of this week, inside the pre-synaptic","terminals, there are vesicles filled with neurotransmitter.","Not all vesicles are in the state ready to use.","In the state they are already close to the membrane so that they can open","upon the arrival of the signal and spill out the neurotransmitter.","","So amongst the total number of vesicles that are around, some sit","just inside the cell useless and the certain fraction is ready to use.","And this fraction will be called P rel.","Now in a steady state transmitter molecules are forced back into the","vesicles, vesicles will dock on the membrane.","So there's a steady state where a certain fraction P0 of vesicles are","ready to use.","If there's a deviation from P0, it takes a time tau p to go back to the","steady state.","That's an exponential approach back to the steady state characterized by this","time constant tau p.","But now suppose a spike arrives.","","A spike arrives, and this spike causes that the vesicles open and send out","the molecules into the synaptic cleft.","","So in fraction of these P rel, this fraction ft will merge with the","membrane and will be empty afterwards.","Since they empty afterwards, they are no longer ready to use.","","So normally, as a function of time, we are at the steady state p0.","Now a spike comes in at time tk, and because of this spike a certain","fraction is used, and then it takes some time to go back","to the normal state.","","P rel is this momentary distance between 0 and this curve.","So this is P rel.","If there's a next spike coming in here, then a fraction of the now","available neurotransmitter vesicles will be used.","So with each spike, we'd go down.","But we can never go below 0 because of this multiplicative factor P rel.","Now, what's the use of P rel?","Well, the total synaptic conductance will be determined by the amount of","neurotransmitter that can be captured.","But if less neurotransmitter is spilled out, less","neurotransmitter is around.","So the total synaptic conductance is limited by this factor P rel.","And in a simple model of the synaptic conductance, we would just have an","exponential pulse that's controlled by the amount of","neurotransmitter that's around.","So let's see how this model works.","Here we have a sequence of four pulses.","First pulse causes a synaptic response.","Second pulses causes a reduced response.","Third pulse, the response is reduced further.","Fourth pulse, the response is nearly 0.","And then it takes some time to recover the response back to the normal value,","and this recovery time was set here to 400 milliseconds.","","Many synapses show depression, but some synapses also show facilitation.","Facilitation is the inverse effect.","With each spike, the response gets stronger.","The first pulse that arrives causes the response of this size.","The second pulse a stronger response.","The third pulse an even strong response, and so forth.","And then it takes some time to recover back to the normal value in this model","simulation if it was set to 200 milliseconds.","The model is, in fact, analogous to the previous one.","There's always a certain amount of vesicles in the state ready to use,","ready to be released, and there could be more ready to be released.","And with each spike, out of those that are not yet in the state ready to be","released, a certain fraction is recruited.","Is moved, say, close to the membrane so that it can be released at the next","spike arrival.","So this factor 1 minus P rel causes a saturation and it assures that P rel","can never grew beyond its maximum value of 1.","To summarize, synapses are not constant.","They change all the time.","Synapses show facilitation.","They can get stronger.","They show depression.","They can get weaker.","The model I've discussed here can be found in the book of Dayan and Abbott.","It's a simple model which treats facilitation and depression","separately.","There is a slightly more complicated model, but of the same structure, of","the same type by Markram-Tsodyks-Pawelzik which allows","to describe facilitation and this depression within the same synapse,","because that's observed.","Some synapses show both, facilitation and depression.","","So with this, I would like to close our discussion of synapses.","Please take some time to look at the quiz that we have prepared for you.","And here's also some literature for synaptic facilitation, depression, and","synaptic modeling.",""],"paragraphs":[0,4900,13050,59000,94660,120630,151280,176660,205700,231130,270920,307130,335000,365540,402610,434640,470470,520799,536280,573470]}
