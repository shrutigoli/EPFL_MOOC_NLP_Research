tau ?].","This term here, rm over rl, I call lambda squared.","","This gives me the final equation, lambda squared, second derivative with","respect to space of the voltage [? tau ?], little m, first derivative","of the voltage with respect to time, plus u of tx rm [? r ?]","external of t and x.","This situation here is the cable equation for the passive dendrite, or","the passive cable equation.","","u is units of voltage.","r times i is unit of voltage.","This is [INAUDIBLE]","with respect to time.","Therefore, [? tau ?] n or tau n is a time constant.","","This is the second derivative with respect to space of the voltage.","The right hand side has units of voltage.","Therefore, this lambda squared has units of space squared.","","Lambda is a length.","Lamda squared is the length squared.","So now, we have a partial differential equation, a differential equation with","two different derivatives, one with respect to space, one","with respect to time--","a partial differential equation, as before.","But it's now completely linear.","This is linear in the voltage.","This is linear in the voltage.","This is linear in the voltage.","And for these kinds of linear differential equations, it's possible","to find solutions analytically.","So let's consider the following paradigm.","We inject a current pulse--","","a very short current pulse, very short.","So inject a current pulse at time t at location x minus x0.","","Now, this current pulse will put a lot of charge at this location.","The charge will spread out in both directions.","The charge will also leaves the dendrite through ion channels.","As a result, the peak that was at location one--","this is where we injected the current--","this peak becomes broader and broader.","Initially, it's sharp.","And it becomes broader and broader.","And because of these transversal currents, the surface under peak will","also decrease over time.","","For this solution to this differential equation, the dendrite was","approximated just as one linear cable, which is very long in this direction","[INAUDIBLE]","infinitely long.","But at the soma, it's closed.","This will be where action potentials are generated.","Here, we are interested just in the dendritic stimulation.","Therefore, we just closed here.","So my pulse injected here will give rise to a very","sharp peak at the beginning.","But then, it will decrease and disappear over time.","","We can follow the effect of the current injection here, not just at","this location, but also at many other locations.","For example, we can follow it at the soma.","So what do you see at the beginning?","The voltage was very little.","Then the voltage increased.","","This would be the second curve.","This is the third curve.","The voltage increases.","And then it decreases again.","Therefore, as a function of time, the voltage first increases and then","decreases again.","So this is for dendritic stimulation.","We stimulate at location one.","And we measure the time course at the soma.","If we stimulate further out in the dendrite--","if there's stimulation here--","[INAUDIBLE]","in the cable, then the total effect at the soma is much less.","If you stimulate close to the soma, then there's an initial sharp rise and","a sharp peak measured at the soma.","To summarize, the cable equation allows us to understand how charge","gives rise--","through synapses or through current injection on the dendrite--","how charge spreads out over the dendrite and how it gives rise to a","post-synaptic potential, how it gives rise to a time course, how it gives","rise to a potential at the soma.","","With this, I would like to close this part.","And please, take a couple of minutes for the quiz before you go on to the","final part of this week, where we discuss mold","neuron models with dendrites.",""],"paragraphs":[0,4590,26730,50500,74320,115280,171210,205250,226280,268930,303770,327650,343840,364120,395120,427650,461310,477420,506805,530060,555240,588230]}
