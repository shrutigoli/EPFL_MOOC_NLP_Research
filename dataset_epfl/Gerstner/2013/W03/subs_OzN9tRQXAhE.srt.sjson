And because of conservation of current, this current","has to split.","Some of it goes as a capacitive current onto the capacitor.","Others parts go through the different types of ion channel.","So the total current is the capacity of current and the sum of all the","different currents through the various ion channels.","","Now, this is just the current at one segment.","This segment here is my segment at location x.","So this would be the current at time t at location x.","So I of t and x has a capacity of current at location x and all these","ionic currents specific for this location x.","We know from previous lectures that the capacity of current can be written","as C, the capacitance, times d/dt of the voltage, u of t and x.","And I'll copy the rest.","","So this would be the total current at this segment at location x.","Now, what can I say about this total current?","","Well, this current here might arise from the fact and that an","experimentalist injects a current at this location--","an external current.","","So a current could arise from current injection by an experimentalist.","","However, that's not the only contribution, because as I mentioned","before, there's a longitudinal current through this longitudinal resistor.","And this longitudinal current I will denote as IL.","And that's longitudinal current at my location x.","But there is also a longitudinal current leaving my segment.","And this is the longitudinal current in my next segment.","The next segment is at location x plus dx.","So this location here is x plus dx, the location on the dendrite.","","So the total current here will be this external current plus the longitudinal","current minus the current that's leaving the segment, which is the","longitudinal current at x plus dx.","","The longitudinal current has to pass through this resistor.","So what can I say about this longitudinal current?","Well, according to Ohm's law, the current is related to the resistance","and the voltage.","The voltage in this segment is u of t and x.","The voltage in this segment is u of t and x plus dx.","This voltage is also the voltage up here at these points.","That means the voltage difference for this resistor, the voltage applied at","this resistor, is u of tx minus u of tx plus dx.","And the current is 1 over r Well","The same type of reasoning can be applied to this part here.","The voltage here would be the voltage at location x minus dx.","And this current, therefore, is u of tx minus dx minus u of tx, again,","divided by RL.","","I add the external current, and then I have this total current.","","I can rewrite this by saying that the RL, this resistance here, longitudinal","resistance, is the same as this RL here.","So I have a single big denominator, RL.","Then I have here u of tx minus dx minus u of tx, another minus u of tx--","it's a factor of 2 here--","plus u of tx plus dx.","So this is the total current.","This is my expression of the total current flowing down here.","But the same current is also described by this first equation up here.","So I have an equality, and I can copy the start equation, c times d/dt u of","t comma x plus the sum of all these ion channel currents, t and x.","Now, this is the final equation which describes the current flow along the","dendrite, between different segments of the dendrite, and the current flow","through the membrane into the outer extracellular space.",""],"paragraphs":[0,4180,25050,60810,95380,108020,137080,152640,178850,199340,212930,225810,270600,301930,335120,374860,397760,429130,466600,498220,532300,567360,618150,653790]}
