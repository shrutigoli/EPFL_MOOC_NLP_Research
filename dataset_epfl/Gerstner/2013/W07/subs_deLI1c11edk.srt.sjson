to the final week of the class, Neuronal Dynamics.","Thanks for staying with me for such a long time.","In the previous weeks, we have covered different aspects of neuron modeling.","This week, they'll put the different strands together, and I hope I can","show the we will arrive at some exciting results.","The question I would like to ask this week is actually what","is good neuron model?","And how can we compare a neuron model with data?","How can we optimize parameters of neuron model so that it really","describes biology.","So let's start with the first question.","Let's suppose we inject an input current into a real neuron.","The input should look like the one, a neuron that's likely","to receive in vivo.","Say it has a fluctuating part and suppose you suddenly see the image of","the signal per house, the mean of the input changes, and you look at","something else, so that's the kind of input current one could inject in a","real neuron.","The real neuron emits spikes.","","What I would like as a first condition for a good neuron model, that if I","inject the very same current into a mathematical neuron model, I would","find the spikes at the same moments in time.","","But moreover, I could ask, well, in this region where there are no spikes,","in the subthreshold region, do the model and the neuron have the same","kind of behavior?","And then ideally, I don't want a model that's just a black box.","Just a books where I get some input and an output.","But ideally, I would like to be able to interpret variables in the model in","terms of biological phenomena.","Well, the model should be flexible so it accounts for a variety of fired","behavior, and at the same time, the mathematical structure of the model","should be such that there exists a systematic procedure to optimize","parameters.","Now, in week one, we have seen a very simple neuron model.","The neuron model consist of just one differential equation and this can be","described by some non-linear function.","And if you look here the derivative, the du/dt, then this means if this","function f is positive, I have movement to the right.","If it's negative, I have movement to the left, so this would be a stable","fixed point of the dynamics.","There's an unstable fixed point up here.","If I apply a constant input, then the du/dt curve is shifted vertically","upwards, and I've no fixed points anymore.","I have a flow that's always towards the right.","And then if it hits this formal reset threshold, then we reset the voltage","to some value ur, and the whole process starts again.","So that's a non-linear integrate-and-fire model.","And the first question is, compared to real data, now, what would be a good","choice of this non-linear function f?","And we have seen in week one that there is a natural","choice related to data.","So one can extract this function f from data.","We've also seen that one can try to extract this function f for more","complex models.","Let's review this first.","","Suppose in a first step we reduce a model like the four dimensional","Hodgkin-Huxley model to two dimensions.","That would be this system of equations.","And we have seen in week four that we can analyze this in the phase plane","where the horizontal axis is the voltage and the vertical axis is this","auxiliary variable w.","","Now, what I have plotted here are the node lines.","So this curve here is the u node line and this curve here","is the w node line.","","The arrows indicate the direction of the flux, and we see here that arrows","are nearly horizontal.","In fact, once the system is here, we know that it will continue along a","trajectory, which I can construct.","And this trajectory, this detour, corresponds to a spike.","So instead of each time modeling this trajectory in the phase plane, you can","say, well, there's some kind of threshold.","Let's call this the threshold, where we detect the spike.","And then instead of integrating the two dimensional differential equation,","we just reset.","Moreover, we see here that arrows are nearly horizontal.","Why?","Because the dynamics of w is much slower than that of the voltage.","Normally, the membrane potential hovers around in the neighborhood of","the fixed point, of the stable fixed point.","That's where the resting potential is.","And there's also a resting value of the auxiliary variable w.","Now, if the input is big enough to kick it out of this regime, then it","will start a horizontal flow.","So we can say that sharing the initial increase of the voltage, w remains","still close to its resting value.","And that means, we may assume that in this region here, just in this region,","w is equal to w rest.","We blocked this back into this equation, w equal to w rest, so this","becomes w rest, and the second equation just disappears.","So now we have just one equation, a voltage equation, with some non-linear","function, and this is the function that's plotted here.","","Above the same range as before, and here I have indicated the threshold,","the numerical threshold for reset.","Once the voltage reaches this point here, we reset to a value ur, say,","this value here.","Now the decision whether a spike is triggered or not, actually happens in","this region down here.","So let's zoom on this region, and then this function looks like a linear","curve followed by an exponential increase.","That means the correct one-dimensional nonlinearity is a combination of a","linear and exponential term.","And this is called the exponential integrate-and-fire model.","Alternatively, as we have seen in week one, I can also extract this function","f directly from data.","If I divide the voltage equation by tau, I have this effective function f","tilde, which is plotted here, and you see that the solid line--","it's a very nice fit.","The solid line consists of a linear term and an exponential.","And that's true for different types of neurons.","It's true for pyramidal neuron.","It's also true for the inhibitory interneuron.","","Thus, if we restrict ourselves to just one voltage equation and combine with","reset, the best function is the one that has a linear term and an","exponential term, and this is called the exponential","integrate-and-fire model.","If the voltage reaches some value above this unstable fixed point here,","say, at this point here, we may reset the voltage and","integration may start again.","","Thus, for one-dimensional neuron models, you can identify the best","non-linearity, it's linear plus exponential.","","It looks like this.","This is called the exponential integrate-and-fire model.","However, that's not sufficient.","Such a model completely neglects adaptation, processes that happen on a","slower time scale.","It's impossible to use such a model to account for the","diversity of firing patterns.","","There's a fixed threshold.","However, we need to make this parameter, theta, somewhat dynamic,","and then this is a deterministic model.","It has no noise.","Now, these additional points will be discussed in the next","lectures of this week.","We'll get rid of these limitations.","To summarize, thus, if we restrict ourselves to one-dimensional","integrate-and-fire models, then the best model is exponential","integrate-and-fire, a linear term in the voltage equation combined with an","exponential.","However, this model has limitations, and they'll get rid of these","limitations in this series of lectures for this final week.","Please, have a look at the quiz.",""],"paragraphs":[0,5470,30440,54680,82750,122000,157750,192860,236180,263110,291940,326030,349260,387610,434160,480210,505900,544240,580070,619520,642480]}
