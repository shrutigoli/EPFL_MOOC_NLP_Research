initial ?] cortex from which our friend experimentalist is recording.","And then we take this membrane voltage, the model voltage, and say,","well, there's a certain firing intensity.","The higher the voltage, the more likely is the neuron is to fire.","And this is called the linear-nonlinear-Poisson model.","So we have our stimulus.","We have a linear filter.","That will be our vector k, the filter k, sub index k.","Then we have some non-linearity.","That's our function f.","We use this to generate spikes with an inhomogeneous Poisson process.","And this gives the linear-nonlinear-Poisson model.","Now this is a special case of the model we had before.","The model before had, in addition, this post-spike current, the spike","after current.","","The linear filter can be combined with a temporal filter, here modeled as","leaky integrator.","","So we are back here in the framework of generalized linear models, or spike","response models with this k noise.","Let's see how well such a model does for the prediction of retinal ganglion","cell activity.","","There's a large field stimulation of the retina.","Light is switched on and off.","And this retinal ganglion cell, one cell is responding like this to","several repetitions of the stimulus.","If you just take an LNP model, you find this kind of responses after","optimization of parameters.","And you see that if you zoom in on one of these bursts, that the real neuron","has some regularity.","Now, trials are ordered so that you are able to see this regularity.","They wouldn't occur naturally in this order.","They are ordered after the recordings.","But you see that after first spike, there's always a pause related to","refractoriness.","And this pause is missing in the LNP model, but it is","present in the GLM model.","Why?","Because the GLM model has the capacity to account for spike after effects.","","If you sum of all the different trials, you get a PSTH.","You get the rate defined in the PSTH for solid line, the real retinal","ganglion cell, and the GLM is the gray line.","And you see an excellent match, whereas the LNP is slightly off from","time to time.","So it's important to have these spike after effects as part of the model.","Now a retinal ganglion cell, one of these models, will talk to other","retinal ganglion cells nearby.","So an even better model would be a network of GLMs, coupled GLMs.","And if you study again a single cell, but now part of a network, and you've","also recorded the other cells--","you have optimized the parameters of the other cells--","then this fully coupled network is even better in the PSTH prediction and","the spike prediction than the uncoupled model.","Now this is an example of encoding.","It presents a stimulus and you record in the LGN somewhere in between, or in","the visual cortex, we determined the receptive fields, we can predict spike","times given knowledge of the stimulus.","Our model is easy to interpret, and it's flexible, and we have a","systematic procedure to optimize parameters.","This is the scenario of encoding.","Now we can turn the flow of the arguments around.","","Suppose after model optimization, suppose now that we just see the","spikes here.","Would we be able to predict the stimulus, given the","observed spike times?","Now this looks like an academic problem.","However, it's not.","There are human patients who have lost say, an arm.","Would it be possible to record from motor cortex, or from frontal cortex--","where plans for movements are made--","and just by observing the spike times, predict the arm movement that the","human intends to do next?","If so, one could use this knowledge to drive [? motorists ?]","of an arm prosthesis, so that the arm moves in the intended direction.","","This sounds like an exciting venue, and indeed, many groups worldwide work","on this problem.","Now interestingly, it's the same kind of generalized linear model that's","used in many cases in this endeavour.","So the model of decoding has the same flavor as our model of encoding, but","it becomes useful for something that looks important for human beings.","And here is an example now.","In one cortex of a monkey, while the monkey performs some hand movement,","you can record the vertical velocity of the hand and the horizontal","velocity of the hand, while measuring spikes in the brain.","Later, you just look at the spikes and you try for a new movement to predict","the intended arm movement.","And you see that the actual movement and the attended movement are very,","very similar.","So this is the final slide.","In this class, we have spent a lot of time to develop the mathematics around","neuron modeling.","We talked about computational neuron science for single neurons.","","And some of you may have asked the question, why all this math?","Is it worthwhile?","And I would say yes, it's worthwhile.","Because once you have understood these mathematical models, it's these kind","of models that can be used for decoding of neuronal spike trains, and","eventually help human patients.",""],"paragraphs":[0,4540,27360,50730,69690,118780,153420,189160,220440,249020,262380,295240,323970,355060,378220,407520,449930,482080,507980,556580,592570,638110]}
