is part four of week seven of the class neuronal dynamics.","In the previous lecture, I've introduced a deterministic version of","the spike response model.","Now let's add noise.","So we have the same filter description as before.","Input is filtered by some filter called kappa.","Output is filtered and fed back in two ways.","There is a refractive filter, eta of s, accounting for refraction as an","adaptation by a modulation of the membrane potential.","And then there is a threshold contribution, a threshold filter,","theta 1, accounting for an increased threshold immediately after a spike.","The only difference is here.","We now say that firing is a stochastic process with a firing intensity that","depends on the momentary distance between the membrane potential--","that would be the red trace here--","and the threshold.","So even though the membrane potential hasn't reached a threshold yet, there","is already a probability that the neuron may fire.","And this is exactly the notions that we have seen last week.","A spike may be fired with a certain instantaneous rate, rho of t, despite","the fact that the membrane potential hasn't reached a threshold yet.","And this model works, for example, for the leaky integrate and fire model or","for leaky integrate and fire model with adaptation, or for non-linear","integrate and fire model, and, in particular, it can be combined with","the spike response model.","A particularly useful choice is an exponential escape rate that was","discussed last week.","So last week we have seen that, with this noise model, we can construct","quantities such as the survivor function.","Given the last spike occurred at t hat, what is the probability the","neuron would survive up to time t without firing again?","This probability of survival decays with the firing rate rho, and,","therefore, we can integrate this, and this is the result.","Similarly, we may ask for the time dependent interval distribution, and","it turns out, in order to fire the next spike at time t, the neuron has","to survive from t hat to t, and then it has to fire.","So we have an expression for the interval distribution.","And this works for all sorts of escape rate functions.","However, formulas turn out to be particularly nice if as, in the escape","rate, we take the exponential one.","Now that's cool, because the exponential one fits well experimental","data measured in cortical slices.","Now, after these preparations, we can now turn to the likelihood of a spike","train in this kind of noise neuron models that are called generalized","linear models.","Suppose an experimentalist has injected some time-dependent current,","a known current, into a neuron, and he has observed a sequence of spikes.","Suppose we inject the same current in our neuron model.","","For example, a spike response model with escape noise, also called","generalized linear model.","Then what is the likelihood that this spike train with our specific spike","times could have been generated by our model?","And as we have seen last week, we have an expression for this.","And this is what this expression looks like.","Let me just go over it again quickly.","So here's a copy of the expression that we had on the previous slide.","So the neuron has to survive from t1 to t2 without firing.","That gives this term here.","But before that, the neuron model had to fire at time t1.","Has to fire again at time t2.","Has to fire again at time t3.","","t1 is supposed to be different spike, so the neuron model has to survive","from zero to t1 without firing and, again, it has to survive from t3 to","end of the measurement, capital T, which gives the final term over here.","","We can collect all these different firing times, and they appear up here","as a product.","And we can collect the integrals and exponent.","It first runs from zero to t1 and from t1 to t2, and from t2 to t3, and then","from t3 to T, capital T, while all this gives one single integral.","And, as we have seen, sometimes we consider the logarithm instead of the","likelihood itself.","","Now, this formulism works for arbitrary stochastic point processes","that are characterized by this instantaneous intensity or","instantaneous firing rate or hazard of firing.","We have seen that if you take a spike response model with its three linear","filters, and if we add escape noise, then we can write down the likelihood","of an observed spike train, the likelihood that such a spike train","could have been generated by the model.","Thus, we have a generative model for spike trains.","That's a technical term used in the statistical and machine learning","literature.","And this generative model has the properties that it depends on","parameters, and we can use this dependence to find the optimal set of","parameters to explain the data.","That will be the topic of the next lecture.","Just remember, a spike response model, together with escape noise, can be","formulated in the framework of generalized linear models, short, GLM.",""],"paragraphs":[0,4770,50110,81460,116560,152600,185020,208120,245650,275960,308410,365040,410570,446410]}
