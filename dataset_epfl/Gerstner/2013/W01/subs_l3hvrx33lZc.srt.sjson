back to the class on neuronal dynamics.","This is part two of week one.","After the overview, we can now turn to the model of a passive membrane.","In the previous lecture, we have already seen the case of an","integrate-and-fire model as an example of a simplified neuron model.","In an integrate-and-fire model, a pulse that comes","in causes some response.","This response can be measured with an electrode.","If several pulses come in, these pulses add up linearly.","The responses add up linearly.","And at some point, in an integrate-and-fire model, the","potential hits the threshold, and out goes a spike.","If you talk about a passive membrane, we focus on the subthreshold regime,","where everything is linear.","And the simplest example of a model of a passive membrane is the model of a","linear circuit, and particularly, an RC circuit.","An RC circuit is called RC because it has a resistor, R, and a capacity, C.","Now suppose a pulse comes in.","The pulse closes the lever for a very short moment of time so that a current","pulse is delivered on to the RC circuit.","As a result of this, the response of the potential, U, will be a","exponentially decaying pulse.","This is the impulse response function of the linear circuit--","of the RC circuit.","If several pulses come in, these linear responses are simply added.","","So far for pulse input.","But you can also study this RC circuit for an arbitrary time-dependent input,","which will cause some kind of voltage response.","The question, then, is, are we able to predict the voltage response for any","arbitrary time-dependent input.","And the answer is yes.","Because the RC circuit can be described mathematically by a linear","differential equation, which I will derive now.","Let's look now at our RC circuit, and derive a mathematical equation in","order to describe the properties of this circuit.","So our RC circuit is called RC because it's characterized by a resistor, R,","and a capacity, C. To keep the treatment slightly more general, I","also introduced, here, the sign of a battery.","This is a battery with voltage, which I call U rest.","","If there is no current injected into the circuit, the voltage measured","across the circuit would be exactly U rest.","U rest stands for resting voltage.","OK.","Now, let's inject some current.","The total current will split up into a part that goes on to the capacitor and","a part that goes on to the resistor.","","Let's try to write this down.","So the total current is conserved.","So the resistive current and the capacitive current, together, must add","up to the current that is injected.","So what can we say about the capacity of current?","","Let us recall that the capacity is defined as charge over voltage.","Let me move the voltage to the other side.","So I have U times C equals Q.","Now what is a current?","A current is charge divided by unit of time.","So I will look at d dt Q. The change of the charge on this capacitor--","this will be, exactly, my charging current, my capacitive current, IC,","which I can now calculate as C times du dt.","","Let me block this into the equation.","So IC is C times du dt.","","What can I say about the resistor?","Well, a resistor is defined by Ohm's law.","The voltage is the resistance times the current.","Now we have to be a little bit careful here.","With current, I mean the current flowing through the resistor.","And with voltage, I mean the voltage across the resistor.","But this is not the total voltage.","The total voltage, U, is the battery voltage, plus the","voltage across the resistor.","In other words, the voltage across the resistor is U minus U rest.","","So I can take the result for IR.","The resistive current is 1 over R, U minus U rest.","","So this is the total current.","Now it's convenient to move this to the left hand side, but keep the sign.","So it's the same as moving this term here, to the outside.","But let me copy this, move this to the left hand side.","C times du dt equals minus 1 over R, U minus U rest plus I of t.","","Sometimes the equation is written in a slightly different form.","If you multiply both sides of the equation by R, by the value of the","resistor, we get R times C du dt equals minus U minus U rest plus R","times I of t.","","This is the final equation.","Let's look at the units of this equation.","This is voltage.","So the equation on the right hand side has units of voltage.","This is the battery voltage.","R times I--","look back at Ohm's law--","is, again, units of voltage.","So the left hand side also has units of voltage.","This part here is voltage divided by time.","That means R times C, together, must have units of time.","And this is why I introduce a shorthand notation, Tau, or \"Tao\", the","time constant of this differential equation.","RC equal Tau is the time constant of this RC circuit.","","And this is the equation we have here, on the next slide.","This is the equation I just derived.","R is the resistor, C is the capacitor.","But R times C is now summarized as the membrane time constant.","You see that, in this electrical diagram, the battery, U rest, is no","longer there.","Indeed, it's possible, mathematically, to make it disappear, and have a","simplified equation where I introduce a new variable, V, as U minus U rest.","","Again, let me show you how this works.","Mathematically, I set V equals U minus U rest.","","Now if I take the derivative of V, dV dt, this is du dt minus the","derivative of U rest.","But U rest is a constant parameter, so the derivative disappears.","Therefore, I have dV dt equals du dt.","Or I can set, here, Tau d dt V is the same as du dt.","But du dt is this equation.","This equation has U minus U rest--","by definition, this is V--","plus R times I of t.","So in the new variable, V, the battery voltage U rest has disappeared.","To summarize, the passive membrane is described by a linear differential","equation, which describes the evolution of a voltage.","A potential battery voltage is included in the derivative definition","of this new variable, V, which appears in both sides of the equation.","","Now let's look at the type of solutions that this equation may have.","Suppose, for the moment, that there is no input.","","So this is gone.","And now the question is, what's the solution.","Well, this is a linear differential equation with a time constant Tau.","Suppose that, for some reason, I start at a value V0.","There's no further input.","Some input may have brought me to V0.","But now it's just freely evolving in the absence of any further input.","The solution of such a linear differential equation is an","exponential decay back, with a time constant Tau, which is exactly this","membrane time constant, the time constant of the linear differential","equation than I have introduced before.","Quite generally, linear differential equations occur in many areas of","science, of physics, of chemistry.","A famous example is radioactive decay.","Exponential decay is the solution of a one-dimensional differential equation.","So quite often, in this class, we will work along the triangle.","On the top of the triangle, we have the experimentalist, which injects","some current I of t into a neuron.","And he might be able to record, with a different electrode, the voltage of","the neuron-- the potential--","the membrane potential of the neuron.","","Now we can try to predict the membrane potential by using an equivalent","electrical circuit.","The simplest case would be a circuit with just a resistor, R, and the","capacity, C. But we will see more complicated circuits","later on in this class.","Now the circuit itself can be analyzed mathematically.","And it's often possible to write down a differential equation that describes","the properties of the circuit, and ideally, also, the","properties of the neuron.","So in this first class, I just talked about the passive membrane, and we","went around the triangle for the case of the passive membrane.","But in other lectures, over the next weeks, we will consider more","complicated models of a neuron, which leads to more complicated circuits,","which leads to slightly more complicated differential equations.","","So if we want to understand the properties of a neuron, we can use","arguments from electricity, and we can use arguments from math.","Let's see how this works.","Let's look at pulse input.","","So for the moment, as input, I use a step current.","The current is 0.","At some time t0--","t \"naught\"-- it switches to a new value.","","The question then, is, how is the voltage of this RC circuit going to","respond, or equivalently, how is the differential equation going to","respond, or--","plus, in neuroscience--","how is the neuron going to respond to a step current input.","The voltage, in response to the step current input, will be a constant at","the battery voltage U rest.","It's just sitting there.","And then, at time t0, it will jump, like the input current.","But it will move to a new value.","It will approach a new value.","And the approach is, again, going to be exponential with time constant Tau,","the time constant of the differential equation.","","Now suppose I stop the stimulation after some time, say, here, and","we go back to 0.","In this case, the voltage trajectory will be the same.","","The differential equation of the neuron, or the circuit, does not know","that the input is about to change.","But then, when you change, the two curves become different, it will","return, exponentially, back to the resting value U rest.","","Now let's do the following.","Let's consider a pulse which is shorter.","It's half as long, but twice as high, like this.","So the surface under the pulse is the same as before.","Now what's the surface under the pulse?","The surface under the pulse corresponds to the charge--","the total charge delivered onto the circuit.","","Now with a pulse twice as high, the response will go up twice as fast.","And then, it stops here until it turns, exponentially,","to the resting value.","Now imagine that I make the pulse even shorter--","again, half as long as the red one--","but twice as big.","So it's now a really huge pulse, in a very, very short amount of time.","The rise is, again, much faster.","","And it will end here.","And then afterwards, I have exponential decay.","","So what you see is that, if I make the pulse shorter and shorter while","keeping the area under the pulse the same--","which means, while keeping the total charge deposited on","the circuit the same--","the voltage response always has to same amplitude.","","And in the limit that the pulse becomes very short, it's just a jump--","a jump from the previous value to a new value.","In the limit that the pulse becomes very, very short, I can say the total","charge, Q, which corresponds to the surface under the pulse, is deposited","in a very, very, very short time.","And this notion of a given charge deposited in a very short time is","denoted by the so-called Dirac delta function.","","So the Dirac delta function is a mathematical abstraction.","It's a mathematical abstraction because no experimentalist is able to","deposit a certain amount of charge in an infinitely short time.","It's a mathematical abstraction.","However, the mathematical abstraction makes sense because the jump is always","to the same value, however short the pulse is, as long","as it's short enough.","So this pulse--","the delta function at time t0 cannot really be drawn, because the pulse","should be very, very high and very short.","That's impossible.","So as such, the object--","Dirac delta function--","it's really an operator--","does not make a lot of sense.","However, it does make sense, because we use this Dirac delta function in","the differential equation, which we need to integrate.","And once you integrate over the current pulse, you","get back the charge.","Once you integrate over the Dirac delta function, you","get very useful results.","And one of the two parts of the definition is that, if you integrate","over the Dirac delta function from a value before t0 to after t0, then the","integral is always normalized to 1.","And the more interesting property is that, if you integrate over the Dirac","delta function, together with some other function, f--","some arbitrary function f of t--","then it just peaks out the time point t0 as a result.","","Now with this, let me come to the end of this part.","In this class, we will quite often walk around the triangle from","experimental neuroscience, to circuits, to math.","And the famous example is the Hodgkin-Huxley model, that we will see","next week, or the integrate-and-fire model, that we will","talk about this week.","And the first example has been the passive membrane.","In order for you to get used to working with these kinds of","differential equations, please spend, now, 15 minutes on","the following exercise.","Some of you are used to working with these kinds of linear","differential equations.","Others need to be reminded.","So everybody, please try to get a solution of the following differential","equation in the case of some current injection.","And the current injections we consider are, first, a step current injection,","a pulse current injection, and finally, an","arbitrary current injection.","And in the context of this pulse current injection, I would like you to","work through this iteration that the surface of the pulse is always the","same, but the pulse becomes shorter and shorter.","So please spend some time with the exercises before we","continue with the lesson.",""],"paragraphs":[0,3450,18250,54170,86330,130870,164090,218661,256089,282860,323170,386210,438580,474760,517370,560300,626270,649560,671620,707840,724050,748620,769570,812240,833550,871280,903770,938070,969550,998940,1011130,1044250,1103770,1138000,1177700,1205600,1236410]}
