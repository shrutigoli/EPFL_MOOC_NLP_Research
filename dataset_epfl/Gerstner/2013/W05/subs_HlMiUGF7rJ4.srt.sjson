Now a","different neuron may also have nine spikes, but the spike train in this","case is much more regular.","In order to distinguish between the first case and the second one, it's","important to look at the distribution of interspike intervals.","In this case, there are some short intervals, there are some medium","intervals, there are some long intervals.","Whereas in the other case, all the intervals are nearly the same.","So that interspike interval distribution measures the variability","of the firing where it's a measure of the regularity.","This would be a regularly firing neuron, a regular firing spike train.","And this would be a rather irregular spike train.","And an irregular spike train is characterized by a broad distribution","of interspike intervals.","The interspike interval distribution accounts for the regularity or","irregularity of a spike train.","Now let's come back to our measurement.","So you have presented a stimulus.","In this trial, we found 5 spikes.","Now we can wait a moment so that the brain gets back to its resting state,","and then we present the same stimulus again.","In the second trial, we would, for example, find 6 spikes.","In the next trial, three spikes.","And you'd a total of, say, 200 trials, or K trials.","In trial K in the last trial, we would have 4 spikes.","Now you see that the spike count measure itself is variable.","It changes between one trial and the next.","Do you see how much this variance is, and can calculate the final factor?","First, we determine the mean.","So the mean spike count, in this case, would be 5","And then we look, how much does each trial vary from the mean number?","So some trials, there are 6.","Some trials, there are 4.","There might be other files with 9 or with 1.","And this variance is normalized by the mean spike count, and this is called a","Fano factor.","That's the Fano factor--","measures repeatability across repetitions.","So the spike count measure--","firing rates defined by a spike count divided by a mean firing rate--","are very useful tools to analyze experimental data","recorded in real neurons.","However, there's a problem.","The problem is that this is a slow way off coding.","While this is a good measure to analyze experimental data, it's not a","code that's used by the brain.","It's not the code used by the neurons.","And to see this, let me discuss a little example.","Suppose I have a little frog sitting in its pond, and it's waiting for the","fly to come by.","Now the fly passes close to the frog.","And the total duration, when it's in the neighborhood of the frog, is less","than 1 second.","Now if the frog used a spike current measure, where a typical neuron fires","at a few Hertz, you would have to wait at least 1 second to","count enough spikes.","But after 1 second, the fly has already passed.","So this is definitely not the code used by the neurons.","So let's look at a different definition of firing rate.","So let's again present our stimulus--","say, the Sydney Opera House--","and we record in a first trial a certain number of spikes.","And then, we take a pause.","We wait so that the brain comes back to the resting state, and we present","the stimulus again, and we find it again, and again.","But now, instead of just counting the total number of spikes, we define","short time windows.","For example, in this first interval, we could count across all repetitions,","we would find 1 spike.","In the next time interval, we would find 1 spike, then we find 3 spikes,","then we find 1 spike and we find 3 spikes again, and so forth.","And so, you can imagine that overall, this gives a time-dependent response.","This is the PSTF--","the peristimulus time histogram.","Peristimulus time histogram.","The histogram can start slightly before the stimulus, so we would have","a few spikes before the stimulus starts.","Peristimulus time histogram.","Now formally, this means we count the number of spikes in a short time in","the delta T across K repetitions.","We divide by K. We divide by the duration of our counting interval.","And then this gives a the rate measure.","It's 1 over time, units are Hertz.","It's a rate measure, but now with a temporal resolution defined by delta","T. For example, if you picked delta T equals 1 millisecond, you have a very","nice temporal response pattern.","Suppose the stimulus is presented here.","And you see, for example, at the beginning, we have quite a few spikes,","then we have a dip, then comes the second wave of spikes, and so forth.","So now we have a temporal resolution of our definition of a firing rate.","This is possible because we have averaged across trials.","So this is a very powerful experimental tool.","However, again, it cannot be the measure used by the fly.","The reason is it's way too slow.","Let's again consider our fly sitting here.","And now, the fly comes by, and the frog says to the fly, well, please fly","again another 50 time so that I can average so that I can","finally catch you.","So that's not going to happen.","Fortunately, there's yet another definition of firing rates.","I mentioned in the beginning that neurons are often organized in pools","of neurons, or populations of neurons, with similar properties.","Suppose we have a population of 500 neurons, and with a multi-electrode","recording array, you are able to record from all 500 neurons","simultaneously while you present the stimulus.","So the picture is the same as before.","The difference now is that this is a single trial, and","it's different neurons.","The first line is neuron 1, the second line is neuron 2, that last line is","neuron K.","So in this case, the rate can be defined by a population average.","I count in a short time interval delta T, I count all the spikes across the","different neurons in a population.","I divide by delta T, I divide by N, the number of neurons.","","There are n neurons.","And because I divide by delta T, it has, again, units of rate.","The units are 1 over time, the units are Hertz.","Now I would claim that this is a rather natural situation for neurons.","Consider a post-synaptic neuron.","A post-synaptic neuron receives hundreds of inputs from other neurons.","Suppose some of the inputs come from the same population of 500 neurons.","So effectively, this neuron would be driven by the population activity, by","the population of spikes arriving in each short time interval delta T. So","in that sense, this definition of a firing rate--","firing rate defined as a population average--","is natural.","So let me summarize.","They are at least three different definitions of a firing rate.","All three are useful experimental tools for data analysis.","The first one is based on temporal averaging.","Temporal averaging cannot be the code used by neurons,","because it's too slow.","The second one is repetition across different trials, and then averaging.","Again, in an actual situation, an animal is not going to average all the","different trials before it can react.","And the final definition is that of a population average.","Let's assume that there are groups of neurons with similar properties.","Then, you can define a population activity--","a firing rate averaged across the population.","","So your reputation experiment--","measuring a single neuron, and then averaging over K repetitions of same","experiment--","can be seen as an approximation of the population coding used by the brain.","Before we continue, please have a look at the quiz.",""],"paragraphs":[0,4200,26180,40790,68170,89280,106690,123840,155285,189590,221070,239250,253110,278360,296620,329400,345090,362580,387730,417260,440770,470360,505390,530250,545780,562370,596450,613710,636620,654310,688010,701210,726310]}
