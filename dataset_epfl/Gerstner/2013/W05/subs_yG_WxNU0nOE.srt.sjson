fluctuating ?]","contribution to the current.","And for this superthreshold regime, the interval","distribution is sharply peaked.","","And if the noise level is low, then the peak would sit exactly at the","interspike interval, T, which you would find for noise-free stimulation.","","To say it differently, in this superthreshold regime, the neuron","would fire in any case.","In the absence of noise, it would fire regularly.","The noise adds a little bit off jitter so that we have a strongly peaking","interspike internal distribution.","But this interval distribution is narrow.","","On the other hand, in the subthreshold regime, the interspike interval","distribution is much much, much broader.","Without the noise term, there would be no spike at all.","So it's these tiny fluctuations make that eventually, from time to time,","the membrane potential hits the threshold.","","That's spike firing is driven by the fluctuations.","","We call this the fluctuation driven regime.","On this side here, it's driven by the mean input.","","The mean input alone would make the neuron fire.","Interestingly, if we zoom in on this subthreshold regime, it looks very","similar to the in vivo data of subthreshold membrane potential","fluctuations.","To summarize, a leaky integrate-and-fire model driven by a","time dependent input current where the input current has a mean and a","fluctuating part, also called a noisy input part--","such an integrate-and-fire model can be driven in two different regimes.","It can be in the superthreshold regime.","In this case, the mean input is enough to fire the neuron, and the neuron","executes more or less regular firing.","It's nearly periodic with a small jitter.","The more interesting regime is the subthreshold regime, because it's in","this regime that you see subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations.","Spikes are rare events.","They are driven by the fluctuations of the membrane potential.","In the absence of these fluctuations, the neuron would never fire.","Thus, we have identified the subthreshold regime as a particularly","interesting regime in relation to in vivo data.",""],"paragraphs":[0,4240,21340,56510,79140,104310,123040,150490,197490,239610,265380,302590,339990,367340,395860,439390,475730,497220]}
