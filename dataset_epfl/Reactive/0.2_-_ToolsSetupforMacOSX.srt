00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,094
Hi.
In this video, we are going to show you

2
00:00:02,094 --> 00:00:07,043
how to install the tools required for our
class on your machine.

3
00:00:07,043 --> 00:00:12,084
This video is for people using Mac OSX.
If you're using a different operating

4
00:00:12,084 --> 00:00:18,052
system, check the getting started section
on the video lectures part of the class

5
00:00:18,052 --> 00:00:21,098
website.
Everything that we show in this video is

6
00:00:21,098 --> 00:00:27,028
also explained in text on the Tools Set Up
wiki page on the class website.

7
00:00:27,028 --> 00:00:32,036
So, let's have a look at this page.
As you can see, there are three things

8
00:00:32,036 --> 00:00:37,073
that you need to install on your machine
in order to prepare for this class.

9
00:00:37,073 --> 00:00:43,038
The first one is the JDK, the Java Runtime
Environment, which is used to execute

10
00:00:43,038 --> 00:00:47,023
Scala programs.
The second one is SBT, a build tool for

11
00:00:47,023 --> 00:00:53,534
Scala, which you will also use to submit
your assignment solutions to Coursera.

12
00:00:53,534 --> 00:00:58,139
The third one is the Scala IDE for
Eclipse, which is the IDE that we are

13
00:00:58,139 --> 00:01:02,793
going to use in this class.
Okay, so, let's get started by installing

14
00:01:02,793 --> 00:01:07,165
the Java debug kit.
Every section in this tutorial has three

15
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:10,706
sub sections one for each operating
system.

16
00:01:10,706 --> 00:01:16,794
Since we are currently on Mac OS10, we
will look at how to install JDK on Mac

17
00:01:16,794 --> 00:01:20,182
OSX.
In fact, Mac OSX either comes with Java

18
00:01:20,182 --> 00:01:24,838
pre-installed or it will install it
automatically for you.

19
00:01:24,838 --> 00:01:30,530
To verify, if you already have Java, you
have to open a terminal application.

20
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:35,768
So, you open the Finder, we go to the
Applications folder and we open the

21
00:01:35,768 --> 00:01:40,593
Utilities folder.
In utilities, there's the application

22
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:45,643
named terminal.
Since we will be using the terminal a lot,

23
00:01:45,643 --> 00:01:50,472
in this class it makes sense to drag it
into your dock.

24
00:01:50,472 --> 00:01:55,717
Okay, so we can close the Finder window,
open a terminal.

25
00:01:55,717 --> 00:02:00,826
And now, we want to verify if we have Java
installed.

26
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:06,660
In order to do that, you type Java minus
version into the terminal.

27
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:11,082
On this machine I don't have Java
installed yet.

28
00:02:11,082 --> 00:02:16,864
So, I will get the window which tells me,
to open Java, I actually need to install

29
00:02:16,864 --> 00:02:20,490
it.
So, the only thing you need to do is click

30
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,633
the Install button.
Of course, you have to agree to the

31
00:02:24,633 --> 00:02:26,471
license agreements.
Okay.

32
00:02:26,471 --> 00:02:32,044
So, once the Java installation has
finished, we just click Okay and we run

33
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:37,077
Java minus version again.
Now, we see the version number of the Java

34
00:02:37,077 --> 00:02:40,435
installation that has been installed.
Okay.

35
00:02:40,435 --> 00:02:47,489
So, we close this terminal window and we
move on to the second tool that we need to

36
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,818
install.
The second tool that we need to install is

37
00:02:50,818 --> 00:02:54,023
SBT.
In order to install SBT on your system,

38
00:02:54,023 --> 00:02:59,168
you can either use the homebrew package
manager or you can do a manual

39
00:02:59,168 --> 00:03:02,706
installation.
In this video, I will do a manual

40
00:03:02,706 --> 00:03:06,532
installation.
So, we download SBT from this URL.

41
00:03:06,532 --> 00:03:14,774
Once the download has finished, we
navigate to the file in the Finder, and we

42
00:03:14,774 --> 00:03:18,404
double click it to extract SBT.
Okay.

43
00:03:18,404 --> 00:03:24,749
So, since SBT is an application that we
will reuse in the future, we will move it

44
00:03:24,749 --> 00:03:30,093
to a different location.
So, I open a new Finder window, and in my

45
00:03:30,093 --> 00:03:35,069
home folder I create a subdirectory named
applications.

46
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:44,088
Now, I take the extracted SBT folder and I
move it to my newly created Applications

47
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:48,040
folder.
Inside the SBT folder, you have a bin

48
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:52,075
subdirectory, which contains the
executable files for SBT.

49
00:03:52,075 --> 00:03:57,099
So, let's close the Finder window and go
back to the tutorial.

50
00:03:57,099 --> 00:04:03,082
So, we downloaded SBT, we unpacked the
Archive, and moved it to the Applications

51
00:04:03,082 --> 00:04:07,555
folder.
And, and what we need to do last is adding

52
00:04:07,555 --> 00:04:12,005
the bin directory of SBT to the path
environment variable.

53
00:04:12,005 --> 00:04:17,482
In order to do that, you have to open the
file.bash<u>profile which is located in</u>

54
00:04:17,482 --> 00:04:23,085
your home directory.
If the file doesn't exist yet, you will

55
00:04:23,085 --> 00:04:29,016
have to create it.
Okay, so let's open a new Terminal window

56
00:04:29,016 --> 00:04:34,761
and lets check if the bash<u>profile file
already exists.</u> So, we type

57
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:38,538
ls.bash<u>profile.
In my case, the file does no exist yet</u>

58
00:04:38,538 --> 00:04:44,008
but it might very well be that you
already have it.

59
00:04:44,008 --> 00:04:50,970
So, in order to create or edit a file, we
can use the Nano Text Editor, which is a

60
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:57,887
very simple command-line text editor.
We type, nano.ash<u>profile and hit</u>

61
00:04:57,887 --> 00:05:05,001
Enter. So now, we need to add one
export command to dispatch profile file.

62
00:05:05,001 --> 00:05:10,004
We go back to the setup instructions, we
copy the export command.

63
00:05:10,004 --> 00:05:18,014
Right click, Copy, and go back to the
terminal, and paste it using right click

64
00:05:18,014 --> 00:05:22,094
Paste.
Now, in fact, we have to change the path

65
00:05:22,094 --> 00:05:31,004
of our SBT installation to match the path
were we actually extracted SBT.

66
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:38,082
In my case, this was /users/luc, my
username, /applications, and then SBT bin

67
00:05:38,082 --> 00:05:44,994
Now, we can exit the Nano text editor
using Control+X, and we will save the

68
00:05:44,994 --> 00:05:52,093
changes to the file by confirming with Y
and then hitting Enter for the file name.

69
00:05:52,093 --> 00:05:57,069
Okay, now, we need to verify if SBT has
been installed correctly.

70
00:05:57,069 --> 00:06:02,053
We close the Terminal window and we go
back to the instructions.

71
00:06:02,053 --> 00:06:08,050
In order to verify the SBT installation,
we have to start a new Terminal window,

72
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:14,009
and we have to type SBT-H.
If the installation was successful, then

73
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:17,088
you'll see SBT Help message appear on the
screen.

74
00:06:17,088 --> 00:06:24,024
Okay, so, we close the Terminal window, we
go back to the set up instructions and we

75
00:06:24,024 --> 00:06:30,013
go to the last tool that we have to
install, the is Scala IDE four eclipse.

76
00:06:30,013 --> 00:06:38,332
In order to install this Scala IDE, we
have to open this website and scroll down

77
00:06:38,332 --> 00:06:43,054
to the downloads.
Now, you have to find the version of the

78
00:06:43,054 --> 00:06:47,053
Scala IDE which matches your operating
system.

79
00:06:47,053 --> 00:06:52,058
In my case, I am on a 64-bit Mac OSX.
So, I click this link.

80
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:59,049
Once the download of the Scala IDE has
finished, we open the Download folder in

81
00:06:59,049 --> 00:07:04,052
Finder.
We unpack the Scala IDe by simply double

82
00:07:04,052 --> 00:07:09,529
clicking the file.
Since, the Scala IDE is on applications

83
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:16,006
that we will reuse in the future, we will
also move it to our Applications folder.

84
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:21,069
So, I open a new window, I go to my
Applications folder, and then move the

85
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:27,072
Eclipse folder into my applications.
In order to open the Scala IDE, you simply

86
00:07:27,072 --> 00:07:32,081
go into the Eclipse folder and you double
click the Eclipse file.

87
00:07:34,012 --> 00:07:40,047
When starting up Eclipse, you have to
define which your, workspace you want to

88
00:07:40,047 --> 00:07:43,089
use.
We recommend that you create one work

89
00:07:43,089 --> 00:07:49,042
space which you can then reuse for all the
assignments of our class.

90
00:07:49,042 --> 00:07:55,069
I will do this now by clicking the Browse
button and going to my home folder.

91
00:07:56,007 --> 00:08:02,011
Okay.
So now, here I will create a new folder

92
00:08:02,011 --> 00:08:11,043
named ProgFun Workspace.
I will select the folder and click Open.

93
00:08:12,022 --> 00:08:17,084
By clicking Okay, Eclipse will start up
using that new workspace.

94
00:08:17,084 --> 00:08:23,098
Okay, in order to test the Scala IDE,
we'll go back to the tool set of

95
00:08:23,098 --> 00:08:28,099
instructions page.
We can close the Download page, and the

96
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:36,011
Tool Setup page explains you to create a
simple Hello World project in the Scala

97
00:08:36,011 --> 00:08:39,044
IDE.
I will show you how to do this now.

98
00:08:39,044 --> 00:08:45,086
So, you go to Eclipse and in the menu ,
you select File, New Scalar Project.

99
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:52,037
You give the project a name, for instance,
Hello World.

100
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:56,092
Okay.
In order to enter the source code for the

101
00:08:56,092 --> 00:09:02,011
Hello World application, we have to create
a new Scala object.

102
00:09:02,011 --> 00:09:08,092
So, we open a project, and we right-click
on the Source folder, and select U Scala

103
00:09:08,092 --> 00:09:14,013
object.
We give the object a name, in this case,

104
00:09:14,013 --> 00:09:19,021
Hello.
And we define in which package job check

105
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:23,098
we defined, so we put here the package
greeter.

106
00:09:23,098 --> 00:09:29,041
We confirm by clicking Finish.
Okay, now, the source code for the Hello

107
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:34,038
World application can be found on the
Tools Setup instructions.

108
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:40,061
So, we go back to the wiki page and we
scroll down to find the source code that

109
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:44,039
we need.
We select it, copy it, go back to Eclipse

110
00:09:44,039 --> 00:09:49,789
and just paste it into the file.
We saved the file and, you can notice that

111
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:55,562
once you save the file, Eclipse will
automatically compile the entire project

112
00:09:55,562 --> 00:09:59,046
for you.
In order to execute the Hello World

113
00:09:59,046 --> 00:10:05,020
application, you simply have to right
click on the hello.scala source file,

114
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:08,045
select Run S, and select Scala
application.

115
00:10:08,045 --> 00:10:15,640
You will see the output of the Hello World
program in the, in the eclipse console.

116
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:21,868
The next feature that we are going to show
you, is a brand new feature named the

117
00:10:21,868 --> 00:10:25,787
Scala worksheet.
In a Scala worksheet, you can type

118
00:10:25,787 --> 00:10:30,791
arbitrary Scala expressions and see them
evaluated on the fly.

119
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:34,400
It's a great tool to learn and explore
Scala.

120
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:41,375
In order to create the worksheet, we right
click on the Create Package, we select New

121
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:47,345
Scala Worksheet.
You have to give the worksheet a name, and

122
00:10:47,345 --> 00:10:50,551
click Finish to create it.
Okay.

123
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:58,621
I will increase the size of this window in
order to see all the, all the worksheet.

124
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:04,616
Now, to try out the worksheet, we have
prepared some instructions for you that

125
00:11:04,616 --> 00:11:07,619
you can paste into this newly created
object.

126
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:12,952
So, if you go back to the set up
instructions, and scroll down to the

127
00:11:12,952 --> 00:11:18,762
bottom of the page, you will see a few
lines of code that you can copy and paste

128
00:11:18,762 --> 00:11:21,740
back in this freshly created Scala
worksheet.

129
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:25,317
Okay.
Once you save to file, Eclipse will

130
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:32,426
automatically evaluate at all the lines
that are part of the worksheet and show

131
00:11:32,426 --> 00:11:36,765
the result of the evaluation on the right
hand side.

132
00:11:36,765 --> 00:11:41,188
In this example, we assigned the number
one to the value x.

133
00:11:41,188 --> 00:11:47,462
We define the function increase which
returns its argument increase by one.

134
00:11:47,462 --> 00:11:53,549
Every test increase by invoking it and
passing x into the function.

135
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:57,411
You can see that increase of x returns
two.

136
00:11:57,411 --> 00:12:03,667
Now, if you go back to Worksheet, and
change the definition of x, for instance

137
00:12:03,667 --> 00:12:09,809
to be five, as soon as we save the file,
the whole buffer will be reevaluated.

138
00:12:09,809 --> 00:12:16,024
And you can see that the result of the
invocation of increase is now six.
