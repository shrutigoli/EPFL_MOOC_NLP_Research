1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,743
Hi.
In this video we are going to show you how

2
00:00:02,743 --> 00:00:06,473
to install the tools required for this
class on your machine.

3
00:00:06,473 --> 00:00:10,245
This video is for people using the Linux
operating system.

4
00:00:10,245 --> 00:00:16,075
If you're on a different operating system,
check the Getting Started section in the

5
00:00:16,075 --> 00:00:22,046
video lectures part of the class website.
Everything that is shown on this video is

6
00:00:22,046 --> 00:00:27,256
also explained in text on the Tools Setup
Wiki page of the class website.

7
00:00:27,256 --> 00:00:32,933
So we go to the tool setup page, and we
see that there are three things that we

8
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:37,982
need to install for our class.
The first one is the JDK, the Java

9
00:00:37,982 --> 00:00:44,303
Development Kit, which is a run-time
environment on which Scalar programs are

10
00:00:44,303 --> 00:00:48,043
executed.
The second one is SPT, a build tool for

11
00:00:48,043 --> 00:00:54,356
Scala, which you will also be using for
submitting your assignment solutions to

12
00:00:54,356 --> 00:00:58,945
Coursera.
The third one is the Scalar ID for

13
00:00:58,945 --> 00:01:04,587
Eclipse, which is the ID, which we are
going to use in this class.

14
00:01:04,587 --> 00:01:07,779
Okay.
So let's get started by installing the

15
00:01:07,779 --> 00:01:10,699
JDK.
In the section, installing the JDK, there

16
00:01:10,699 --> 00:01:15,653
are three subsections for different
operating system, And this week, we are

17
00:01:15,653 --> 00:01:18,778
going to look at the part related to
Linux.

18
00:01:18,778 --> 00:01:24,677
When recording this screen cast, I am on a
Ubuntu system and therefor these are the

19
00:01:24,677 --> 00:01:29,822
instructions that apply to my system.
If you are using a different Linux

20
00:01:29,822 --> 00:01:34,923
distribution you will have to do the JDK
installation differently.

21
00:01:34,923 --> 00:01:40,638
So on Ubuntu the only thing that we need
to do is start a terminal and install the

22
00:01:40,638 --> 00:01:45,199
open JDK using app get.
To start a terminal, I just click on the

23
00:01:45,199 --> 00:01:48,846
dash home in Ubuntu and I search for
terminal.

24
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:54,158
And I can launch terminal.
Since we will be using the terminal a lot

25
00:01:54,158 --> 00:01:59,535
in this tutorial, I will lock it to the
launcher and make it available more

26
00:01:59,535 --> 00:02:03,674
quickly.
Okay, the command to install the open JDK

27
00:02:03,674 --> 00:02:10,092
on Ubuntu is the following.
So we do, apt get install on JDK 7-JDK.

28
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:18,074
And you have to enter your password, and
then app-get will ask you to confirm.

29
00:02:18,074 --> 00:02:23,009
And, now it will download and install to
JDK.

30
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:27,074
Okay.
Once that apt-get has finished installing

31
00:02:27,074 --> 00:02:34,076
the JDK, we want to make sure that
everything has been set up correctly.

32
00:02:34,076 --> 00:02:42,341
We go back to the Tool Setup page.
And we read the section, verifying your

33
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:46,075
setup.
So, what we have to do is, starting a new

34
00:02:46,075 --> 00:02:52,508
terminal, so you close the existing one
and start a new one, and then you have to

35
00:02:52,508 --> 00:02:57,060
type java-version.
Now, you can see the version number of the

36
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,227
JDK, that you just installed.
Okay, since this worked fine, we are

37
00:03:02,227 --> 00:03:07,452
closing the terminal window and moving on
to the second step.

38
00:03:07,452 --> 00:03:13,014
The second step is installing SBT.
In order to install SBT, it has to be

39
00:03:13,014 --> 00:03:17,699
downloaded from this URL.
So, we simply click the URL, we save the

40
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:21,023
file.
And Firefox will send it to the download

41
00:03:21,023 --> 00:03:26,237
folder of my home directory.
So, we go to the home directory, download

42
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:31,932
folder, and we see this SBT archive.
So now, we have to extract the archive.

43
00:03:31,932 --> 00:03:37,336
One way to do this in a Window is right
clicking on the file and just selecting

44
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:42,528
extract here.
Okay, so the SBT folder process has now

45
00:03:42,528 --> 00:03:47,097
been created.
Contains indirectly, which in fact

46
00:03:47,097 --> 00:03:53,562
contains the executable for SBT.
So since SBT is a program that we might

47
00:03:53,562 --> 00:03:59,753
want to use in the future, I'm going to
move it to a different location.

48
00:03:59,753 --> 00:04:07,100
So I cut the SPT folder and in my home
directory I create a new folder, which I

49
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:12,852
call 'applications'.
And I paste this SBT folder in there.

50
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:18,138
Okay, so let's go back to the tool setup
instructions.

51
00:04:18,138 --> 00:04:24,003
So we already unpack the archive.
And now what you need to do is add in the

52
00:04:24,003 --> 00:04:30,362
bin directory of the SPT installation that
we just downloaded in the path environment

53
00:04:30,362 --> 00:04:33,949
variable.
In order to do that, you have to open a

54
00:04:33,949 --> 00:04:39,698
file called dash rc which is in your home
directory in a tech study tour.

55
00:04:39,698 --> 00:04:44,790
The easiest way to open that file is to
open a terminal.

56
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:52,823
And type in G edit and then dot bash RC.
This will open the text editor with the

57
00:04:52,823 --> 00:04:58,111
bash RC file.
Now in order to add SBT to the path we go

58
00:04:58,111 --> 00:05:05,962
back to the setup instructions wiki page.
And we copy that export command that we

59
00:05:05,962 --> 00:05:12,950
need to add to the bash RC file.
We copy it and we go back to G Edit, and

60
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:19,212
we scroll down to the end of the file, and
just paste the command.

61
00:05:19,212 --> 00:05:26,734
Now, in fact, you have to update the path
to your SBT directory with the real path

62
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:32,043
on your system.
So the place where I installed it is in

63
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:38,107
dash Home.
And then my user name, LUC, and then back

64
00:05:38,107 --> 00:05:44,954
slash, applications, and SBT bin.
Okay, so I close the G edit text editor, I

65
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:50,440
save my changes.
And now I have to verify that the SBT has

66
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,626
been installed correctly.
In order to do that, I have to open a new

67
00:05:56,626 --> 00:06:04,156
terminal window because the changes to
bash RC will not be applied to existing

68
00:06:04,156 --> 00:06:07,763
terminal sessions.
So I close my terminal.

69
00:06:07,763 --> 00:06:13,058
I open a new one.
And in order to test SBT, I type SBT-H.

70
00:06:13,058 --> 00:06:19,397
As expected, I see a help message from
SBT, so everything is fine.

71
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:26,739
Okay, so now we close the terminal window,
and the last thing that we need to do is

72
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:33,369
installing the Scalae ID for Eclipse.
The Scala ID for Eclipse, with all the

73
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:39,867
plugins and settings that we need for the
course can be downloaded from the

74
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:42,490
following URL.
So I open this page.

75
00:06:42,490 --> 00:06:46,572
New tab.
And I scroll down to the download links.

76
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:53,513
Now you just have to select, the Eclipse
distribution which matches your operating

77
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:57,641
system.
In my case I'm on a Linux system with 32

78
00:06:57,641 --> 00:07:01,662
bits.
So I download this file and save it in the

79
00:07:01,662 --> 00:07:07,565
downloads folder.
Okay, once the download of the Scala ID

80
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:11,522
has finished, I can close the download
window.

81
00:07:11,522 --> 00:07:18,035
Close the download page for the ID.
And open the download folder in my home

82
00:07:18,035 --> 00:07:22,532
directory.
Next, we unpack the downloaded Scala ID

83
00:07:22,532 --> 00:07:27,796
package using the same mechanism as we
used before for SPT.

84
00:07:27,796 --> 00:07:32,657
So we right click on the file, and we
select extract here.

85
00:07:32,657 --> 00:07:36,027
Okay.
Again, since the Scalar ID is an

86
00:07:36,027 --> 00:07:42,898
application that we will continue using in
the future, I right-click on the new

87
00:07:42,898 --> 00:07:48,870
Eclipse folder, select cut, then I go to
my Home folder, and then to Applications.

88
00:07:48,870 --> 00:07:54,111
I right click and select paste.
In order to start Eclipse, I simply open

89
00:07:54,111 --> 00:07:59,046
the Eclipse folder, and double click on
the Eclipse executable.

90
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:05,065
When starting Eclipse, you always have to
define which work space you are going to

91
00:08:05,065 --> 00:08:08,082
use.
We recommend that you create one work

92
00:08:08,082 --> 00:08:14,086
space for this class, which you then can
reuse for all of the assignments of the

93
00:08:14,086 --> 00:08:15,073
class.
Okay.

94
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:21,024
I will do that right now.
So I click the Browse folder to go to my

95
00:08:21,024 --> 00:08:24,016
file system.
I go to my Home folder.

96
00:08:24,016 --> 00:08:29,025
And they create a new folder, which I call
Prog Fun Workspace.

97
00:08:29,025 --> 00:08:32,080
Okay.
And select the folder and click Okay.

98
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,193
And then I start Eclipse.
Okay, so this is the Scalar ID.

99
00:08:37,193 --> 00:08:41,073
In order to verify that everything is set
up correctly.

100
00:08:41,073 --> 00:08:45,030
We go back to the setup instructions wiki
page.

101
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:51,004
On the bottom of the page there's a
tutorial on how to create a hello world

102
00:08:51,004 --> 00:08:55,006
project in Eclipse.
So I will do this right now inside

103
00:08:55,006 --> 00:08:59,081
Eclipse.
In order to create the new project, you

104
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:07,037
select "File", "New", "Scalar Project",
from the menu, and you give the project a

105
00:09:07,037 --> 00:09:11,041
name.
Hello World, and you click finish.

106
00:09:12,026 --> 00:09:16,067
Now we will create the hello world program
file.

107
00:09:16,067 --> 00:09:24,001
So we opened the hello world project.
We right click on the source folder and we

108
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:31,072
select new scalar object.You have to give
the object a name, so in this case we will

109
00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:36,049
use hello and we will put the object into
a package.

110
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:39,728
In this case package greeter.
Okay.

111
00:09:39,728 --> 00:09:46,351
Now the source code for Hello World can
be, again, found on the wiki page.

112
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:52,492
So we go back to the wiki page, and we
scroll down a bit to find the source code

113
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:56,447
of the Hello World application.
We select the code.

114
00:09:56,447 --> 00:10:01,567
Right click and copy.
We go back to Eclipse, and we paste the

115
00:10:01,567 --> 00:10:02,400
code.
Okay.

116
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:08,602
Now, when we save the file, you will
notice that, Eclipse already compiled the

117
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:12,123
file.
Since this file defines an executable

118
00:10:12,123 --> 00:10:16,293
application, you can directly run it
inside Eclipse.

119
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:22,028
The easiest way to do this is
right-clicking on the help word Scalar

120
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:26,038
source file, selecting run as, Scalar
application.

121
00:10:26,038 --> 00:10:31,031
You will then see the output of the "hello
world" program on the bottom of the

122
00:10:31,031 --> 00:10:32,011
screen.
Good.

123
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:37,047
So, the last thing that we're going to
show you in this video is a brand new

124
00:10:37,047 --> 00:10:41,021
feature that has been implemented for the
Scalar ID.

125
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:46,001
The feature is called the Scalar
worksheet, and it gives you a very

126
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:51,079
interactive console to work with Scalar.
In order to create the Scalar worksheet,

127
00:10:51,079 --> 00:10:56,087
you have to right click on a package,
select new, and then select Scalar

128
00:10:56,087 --> 00:11:00,054
worksheet.
You have to give the worksheet a name, and

129
00:11:00,054 --> 00:11:03,021
then click finish.
Okay.

130
00:11:03,021 --> 00:11:07,028
I have to make this window a bit bigger,
okay?

131
00:11:07,028 --> 00:11:14,025
Every expression that you type into a
worksheet will be evaluated on the fly.

132
00:11:14,025 --> 00:11:21,058
In order to demonstrate that, we go back
to the Tool Setup instructions, we scroll

133
00:11:21,058 --> 00:11:28,054
down to the end and we copy the statements
that are at the end of the screen.

134
00:11:28,054 --> 00:11:34,070
We go back to Eclipse and, and we paste
this code into the worksheet.

135
00:11:34,098 --> 00:11:41,026
Okay, so once we save the file, Eclipse
will immediately evaluate all the

136
00:11:41,026 --> 00:11:46,082
questions in the worksheet.
So what we do here is we define a value x

137
00:11:46,082 --> 00:11:50,046
to be one.
We define a function increase which

138
00:11:50,046 --> 00:11:56,061
returns its argument increased by one.
And, we test increase by invoking it, and

139
00:11:56,061 --> 00:12:02,037
we pass the value x into the function.
And you can see, that the result of

140
00:12:02,037 --> 00:12:08,028
passing x into increase, is the value two.
Now, you can easily go back in the

141
00:12:08,028 --> 00:12:14,020
worksheet and change some definitions, for
instance, now we change x to be five.

142
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:20,012
And, once you save the file, the entire
worksheet is re-applied and evaluated, and

143
00:12:20,012 --> 00:12:22,034
the resulting value now is six.
