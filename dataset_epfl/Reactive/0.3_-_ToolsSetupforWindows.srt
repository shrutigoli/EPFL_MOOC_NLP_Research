00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,002
Hi.
In this video, we are going to show you

2
00:00:03,002 --> 00:00:07,092
how to install all the required tools for
our class on your machine.

3
00:00:07,092 --> 00:00:12,083
This video is for Windows users.
If you are on a different operating

4
00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:18,060
system, check the getting started section
of the video lectures on the class web

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,091
site.
Everything that we show in this video is

6
00:00:21,091 --> 00:00:26,074
also described on the Wiki page tools
setup on the class web site.

7
00:00:26,074 --> 00:00:32,080
So we go to the tools set up page and we
see there are three things that we need to

8
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,068
install.
The first one's JDK, the Java run-time

9
00:00:36,068 --> 00:00:40,060
environment which is used to execute
Scalar programs.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:46,033
The second environment is SBT, a build
tool for Scalar projects, which in this

11
00:00:46,033 --> 00:00:51,075
class you will also use to submit your
assignment solutions to Coursera.

12
00:00:51,075 --> 00:00:57,462
The third one is the Scalar ID for Eclipse
and the Scalar worksheet, which is the ID

13
00:00:57,462 --> 00:01:00,609
that we are going to use during this
class.

14
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:06,772
So let's get started with the JDK.
So we check the JDK section and there are

15
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:12,452
three subsections for each operating
systems, so we go to windows.

16
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:18,581
First of all we need to download the JDK
installer from this URL from the Oracle

17
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:23,935
website.
The first thing you need to do is accept

18
00:01:23,935 --> 00:01:28,984
the license agreement.
And then, you can download the JDK

19
00:01:28,984 --> 00:01:35,190
distribution for your architecture.
In my case, I am on X64, so I will

20
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:40,527
download this file.
Once the download has finished, you just

21
00:01:40,527 --> 00:01:46,642
run the downloaded executable installer.
You don't have to change any of the

22
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:50,471
predefined settings.
The default options are fine.

23
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:56,216
The installer will also ask you to install
the Java Run Time environment.

24
00:01:56,216 --> 00:01:59,061
Again, you can just follow the default
options.

25
00:01:59,061 --> 00:02:02,309
Okay.
Once you've finished, you click close, and

26
00:02:02,309 --> 00:02:07,073
you close the [inaudible] websites.
You don't need to register.

27
00:02:07,073 --> 00:02:13,568
To finish the JDK installation, you need
top add the Bing directory of the JDK that

28
00:02:13,568 --> 00:02:17,858
you just installed to the path environment
variable.

29
00:02:17,858 --> 00:02:22,166
How to do this is described on this
website here.

30
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:29,115
I will show you how to do this on Windows
seven You go to the start menu control

31
00:02:29,115 --> 00:02:36,110
panel and in the search box, you type
environment variable and then you get the,

32
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:41,135
the option to edit the system environment
variables.

33
00:02:41,135 --> 00:02:45,758
So you click there.
And you click on the button "invariant

34
00:02:45,758 --> 00:02:51,553
variables." In the list of system
variables, you search for the variable

35
00:02:51,553 --> 00:02:58,349
named path, and you double click on it.
To this list of directories, we will now

36
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:04,388
add the bin directory of the JDK.
So you go to the start menu, computer,

37
00:03:04,388 --> 00:03:10,126
local disk, program files, Java.
You go to the JDK bin directory.

38
00:03:10,126 --> 00:03:17,112
And by taking in the location bar, we can
copy this path by right clicking.

39
00:03:17,112 --> 00:03:24,637
You go back to the system variable window.
And we need to add the semicolon and pace

40
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:31,528
with control B the bin directory of the
JBK You finish up with Okay, and closing

41
00:03:31,528 --> 00:03:36,369
all the dialogues.
You can also close the, all the Explorer

42
00:03:36,369 --> 00:03:37,457
windows.
Okay.

43
00:03:37,457 --> 00:03:43,611
So, now to test that the JDK installation
is successful, you have to open a command

44
00:03:43,611 --> 00:03:47,652
prompt.
Command prompt can be found in the start

45
00:03:47,652 --> 00:03:52,314
menu, either by typing, by searching for
command prompt.

46
00:03:52,314 --> 00:03:58,095
Or, you can just go to start, all
programs, and then accessories, and you

47
00:03:58,095 --> 00:04:03,160
have the command prompt.
So, to check the java installation, type

48
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:09,157
java-version and you should see the
version number of the java you just

49
00:04:09,157 --> 00:04:13,505
installed.
The second step is installing SBT.

50
00:04:13,505 --> 00:04:17,939
Again, we scroll down to the window
section.

51
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:25,514
And as you can see, we have to download
SBT from this URL, so we click here.

52
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:32,998
And we already downloaded installer.
Again, you can leave all the different

53
00:04:32,998 --> 00:04:44,810
options, and just hit Install.
Okay, once SVT is installed we also verify

54
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:51,390
that everything is correctly set up.
So we are going to start and to the

55
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:58,195
comment prompt and then to test SVT we
have to type the following comment.

56
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:05,096
Svt SVT-Version and now SVT will download.
A few dependencies and libraries, but this

57
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:11,087
will only happen the first time you run
SPTF with that, into a start, start drop

58
00:05:11,087 --> 00:05:12,357
much faster.
Okay.

59
00:05:12,357 --> 00:05:18,635
At the end, SPT will show you its version
number, which is supposed to be 0.12.0.

60
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:25,067
Okay, we can exit the common problem.
Now the last thing we need to do is to

61
00:05:25,067 --> 00:05:30,537
installing the scholar id for Eclipse.
This Scala ID for Eclipse can be

62
00:05:30,537 --> 00:05:37,282
downloaded from the following URL.
On this website, you just scroll down to

63
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:42,313
the list of downloads.
And, you select the package according to

64
00:05:42,313 --> 00:05:47,843
your operating system.
Once the download has finished, we open

65
00:05:47,843 --> 00:05:54,674
the downloads folder in explorer.
You right click archive and select extract

66
00:05:54,674 --> 00:05:58,150
all.
I'm going to instruct the, the eclipse,

67
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,286
that's call a id for eclipse to my
desktop.

68
00:06:02,286 --> 00:06:07,537
Good.
Once that Windows has finished extracting

69
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:12,659
the safe file.
We will close the Explorer windows and

70
00:06:12,659 --> 00:06:18,240
also the id download site.
Now we have to start Eclipse.

71
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:26,234
So for that you go the, the desktop.
We go to the Eclipse folder and we just

72
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:33,748
run the Eclipse executable.
Now, whenever you start Eclipse you have

73
00:06:33,748 --> 00:06:38,892
to tell it which workspace to use.
For our class, we recommend that you

74
00:06:38,892 --> 00:06:45,275
create one single workspace that you can
then reuse over all of the assignments.

75
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:48,922
So I will do that now.
I go to my home folder.

76
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:53,883
And I make a new folder, which I called
[inaudible] workspace.

77
00:06:53,883 --> 00:06:58,194
And I say like that, that's my Eclipse
workspace.

78
00:06:58,194 --> 00:07:03,073
Okay, so this is the Scalar ID for
Eclipse.

79
00:07:03,073 --> 00:07:10,009
In order to test whether everything has
been set up correctly, we go back to the

80
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:14,022
wiki page.
And we create a small Hello World word

81
00:07:14,022 --> 00:07:19,038
project in Eclipse, according to the steps
described on this page.

82
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:24,047
I will just do it in Eclipse right now.
So I maximize the window.

83
00:07:24,047 --> 00:07:31,073
I slect file, new, Scala project.
And, I give it a name.

84
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:35,030
Hell.
Hello, world.'Kay?

85
00:07:35,068 --> 00:07:41,051
So in every Eclipse workspace, you can
have multiple projects.

86
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:50,004
Now, in order to create, hello word,
program in Scala, we right click on the

87
00:07:50,004 --> 00:07:53,050
source folder.
Select new Scalar object.

88
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:59,088
And, we create the Scala object, which we
call, hello, for instance.

89
00:07:59,088 --> 00:08:07,026
And we, usually put Scalar code into a
package, so we create package, which is

90
00:08:07,026 --> 00:08:18,000
named cre-, creator.
Okay, now the extra code for the Hello

91
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,005
World is given on the tool setup page.
So we got back to the tool setup page and

92
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:29,928
we scroll down, To see the source code,
and we just copy it and paste it inside

93
00:08:29,928 --> 00:08:31,010
Eclipse.
Okay?

94
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:36,090
We save the file, and you see when you
save the file, Eclipse will immediately

95
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:40,006
compile the work space, the entire
project.

96
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:46,016
Okay, once the file has been compiled, we
can run the Hello World program, by right

97
00:08:46,016 --> 00:08:51,693
clicking on the hello.scalar source file.
Choosing run as inside the, I think Scalar

98
00:08:51,693 --> 00:08:56,011
application.
You will see now that I put the Hello

99
00:08:56,011 --> 00:09:02,037
World program in the Eclipse console.
Okay, this installation of Eclipse also

100
00:09:02,037 --> 00:09:07,024
comes with a brand new feature which is
called the Scalar worksheet.

101
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:13,018
Creating a Scalar worksheet is easy, and
is again described on the tools setup wiki

102
00:09:13,018 --> 00:09:16,022
page.
You can read through the instructions

103
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:19,011
here.
I will just retry it now in Eclipse.

104
00:09:19,011 --> 00:09:22,072
So right click on the greeter package.
We select new.

105
00:09:22,072 --> 00:09:28,077
And we choose scalar worksheet.
We give the worksheet a name.

106
00:09:28,077 --> 00:09:33,031
Okay?
This will give us a new Scala object, in

107
00:09:33,031 --> 00:09:41,018
which we can write arbitrary Scala
expressions, and those will be evaluated

108
00:09:41,018 --> 00:09:46,073
on the fly.
To get an example, I we have some code on

109
00:09:46,073 --> 00:09:55,021
the Tool Setup page that we can just copy
and paste into the worksheet that we just

110
00:09:55,021 --> 00:09:59,062
created.
Okay.

111
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:06,016
And once you save the file.
Eclipse will evaluate all the code that is

112
00:10:06,016 --> 00:10:11,024
in this worksheet object.
So you can see we define a value X.

113
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:17,020
To be one we define an increase function
which returns its argument increased by

114
00:10:17,020 --> 00:10:20,026
one.
And then to test it we just invoke the

115
00:10:20,026 --> 00:10:25,030
increase function and pass x into it and
you see that the result is two.

116
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:31,020
You can change a definition for instance.
Now we say x to be five and once you save

117
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:36,082
the file the change will be immediately
reflected in the rest of the worksheet.
