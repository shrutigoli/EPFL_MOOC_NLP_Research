00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,753
Hi.
In this video, we are going to show you

2
00:00:02,753 --> 00:00:05,506
how to work on the Programming
assignments.

3
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:11,185
We show you how to download them, how to
import them into Eclipse, how to test your

4
00:00:11,185 --> 00:00:14,602
code, and how to submit your solutions
using SBT.

5
00:00:14,602 --> 00:00:18,275
Okay, so, let's get started by going to
the Assignments page.

6
00:00:18,275 --> 00:00:23,711
And we open the Getting Started section
and we go to the instructions of the

7
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:28,665
example assignment.
So, the first thing you need to do is

8
00:00:28,665 --> 00:00:34,167
installing all the required tools.
How to do this is explained on the tools

9
00:00:34,167 --> 00:00:36,772
setup page.
I will quickly show it to you.

10
00:00:36,772 --> 00:00:42,155
And for every Operating System, you can
also have a screen shot which shows you

11
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:46,584
how to set up the tools.
Since I already installed everything on

12
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:49,728
this machine, I just go right into the
assignment.

13
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:56,381
So, the first thing you need to do is
download the assignment archive.

14
00:00:56,381 --> 00:01:00,846
Okay.
We open that file in the Explorer.

15
00:01:00,846 --> 00:01:08,052
And now, I will extract the assignment
archive into my home directory.

16
00:01:08,052 --> 00:01:15,912
So I right click, select Extract All, and
I will create a new directory in my home

17
00:01:15,912 --> 00:01:21,312
folder which I will use for the
programming assignments.

18
00:01:21,312 --> 00:01:29,081
So, I go to my home directory, I create a
new folder, I call it Progfun Assignments.

19
00:01:30,018 --> 00:01:38,040
And I click this right.
So, I closed Explorer window and go back

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,091
to the assignment.
And the first thing we are going to do is

21
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:45,078
start in the Scala record inside the
project that we just created.

22
00:01:45,078 --> 00:01:49,099
How you can do this is explained on the
SBT tutorial website.

23
00:01:49,099 --> 00:01:55,341
So, I opened the SBT tutorial and I follow
the instructions which are on this page.

24
00:01:55,341 --> 00:02:00,278
So, I open a command prompt, I go to the
directory of my assignments.

25
00:02:00,278 --> 00:02:06,558
So, I go to CD Progfun Assignments.
And then here I go CD example, since I am

26
00:02:06,558 --> 00:02:10,890
working on the example assignment, and I
start SBT.

27
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:16,750
Okay, once that the SBT console has
loaded, you can, from SBT start the Scala

28
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:23,042
REPL using the console command.
So, you type console, hit Enter, and then

29
00:02:23,042 --> 00:02:28,098
SBT will start the Scala REPL.
Now, we are in the Scala interpreter.

30
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:35,020
Here, we can type arbitrary Scala
expression, and they will be evaluated on

31
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:39,031
the fly.
For example, you can say Println, and pass

32
00:02:39,031 --> 00:02:43,077
the string, and the Println command will
be evaluated.

33
00:02:43,077 --> 00:02:50,065
That is how we recommend that you start
the Scala interpreter during this class.

34
00:02:50,065 --> 00:02:55,406
In order to close the Scala interpreter
and get back to the SBT console, you have

35
00:02:55,406 --> 00:02:59,091
to type Control+D.
You will not see anything on the screen

36
00:02:59,091 --> 00:03:04,084
except that the Scala interpreter exits.
Now, we are back in the SBT shell.

37
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:07,093
Okay, so now, we will go back to the
assignment.

38
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:13,039
We close the SBT tutorial and we move down
to the next step, which is opening the

39
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,028
project in Eclipse.
So, you start up Eclipse.

40
00:03:16,028 --> 00:03:19,018
In my case, I have a shortcut on my
desktop.

41
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:24,003
And once you start Eclipse, you have to
choose a work space to work with.

42
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:29,021
If you already created a work space for
our class, then you can just use that.

43
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:34,027
Otherwise, you just create a new folder in
your home directory, and use that.

44
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:38,037
So, my work space is a Progfun web space
in my home directory.

45
00:03:39,046 --> 00:03:42,076
Okay.
Inside Eclipse, you can just import a

46
00:03:42,076 --> 00:03:46,069
project that you extracted in your home
directory.

47
00:03:47,052 --> 00:03:52,070
You do this by going to file, import, and
then in the general section you select

48
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:57,081
Existing Projects Into Workspace.
You go next and you browse to the

49
00:03:57,081 --> 00:04:01,020
directory, where you've unpacked the
assignment.

50
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:07,165
So, we go to the Progfun Assignments and
we accept the sample folder which is the

51
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:08,097
project directory.
Okay.

52
00:04:08,097 --> 00:04:12,053
We click Finish.
And all, we already have the source code

53
00:04:12,053 --> 00:04:16,009
imported into Eclipse.
So, we open up the project, and in the

54
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:20,043
source folder, source main Scala.
In the package example, you see the file

55
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:24,532
lists of Scala, which is the file that you
actually have to work on during this

56
00:04:24,532 --> 00:04:27,058
assignment.
Okay, so, let's go back to the

57
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,928
instructions.
So, the next assignment that you have to

58
00:04:29,928 --> 00:04:32,636
do is actually implementing the
assignment.

59
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:37,572
If you look at the code, there are two
functions that need to be implemented, sum

60
00:04:37,572 --> 00:04:40,606
and max.
Both functions are currently defined with

61
00:04:40,606 --> 00:04:44,505
a triple question mark, which means they
are not yet implemented.

62
00:04:44,505 --> 00:04:50,135
Okay, in this case, I will not do a real
implementation, but just return zero for

63
00:04:50,135 --> 00:04:55,802
both of them, which is obviously wrong.
But I don't want to spoil the solution.

64
00:04:55,802 --> 00:05:00,550
So, let's go back to the assignment.
The next step is running new code.

65
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:06,127
There are two ways to run new code.
You can start the Scala REPL, and use the

66
00:05:06,127 --> 00:05:10,700
functions that you just implemented in
Eclipse in the Scala REPL.

67
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:18,189
For that, we go to the Command Prompt.
We go back to the Scala REPL by typing

68
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:22,027
console.
And now, we have another look at the

69
00:05:22,027 --> 00:05:25,417
source code.
So, the two functions that we just

70
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:31,051
implemented are defined in an object list,
which, in fact, lives in package example.

71
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:36,085
So, if you want to use the functions, we
have to either use the full name,

72
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:42,086
example.list.sum or we can also import the
members of this object into the REPL.

73
00:05:42,086 --> 00:05:46,329
In order to import it, we just type import
example.lists.

74
00:05:46,329 --> 00:05:51,290
Which means everything.
And now, two functions that we defined are

75
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:57,032
available so we can try them out.
For instance, we can try the sum function,

76
00:05:57,032 --> 00:06:02,441
and type sum of list of one, two, and
three and we get zero because obviously,

77
00:06:02,441 --> 00:06:05,598
our implementation is not correct.
Okay.

78
00:06:05,598 --> 00:06:10,567
Another way to run your code is using a
main object.

79
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:14,771
This is explained on the, on the
assignment page and I will not go into

80
00:06:14,771 --> 00:06:18,689
details right now.
The next part of the assignment is writing

81
00:06:18,689 --> 00:06:21,418
tests.
So, if you go to Eclipse, you see that

82
00:06:21,418 --> 00:06:26,078
there is a second source folder which is
named Source Tests Scala and this

83
00:06:26,078 --> 00:06:31,043
directory contains tests for our code.
In fact, we already give you a test suite

84
00:06:31,043 --> 00:06:35,012
for the list object.
If you open it up, you will see that the

85
00:06:35,012 --> 00:06:39,921
Lists Tests Suite is a whole tutorial on
how to use Scala test, the tool that we

86
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:43,079
are using for testing.
It is really important that you work

87
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:48,053
through this tutorial because we'll be
using testing a lot during all of our

88
00:06:48,053 --> 00:06:51,080
class.
Okay, let's go back to the assignment.

89
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:57,011
After you're finished testing and
everything is correct, you can submit your

90
00:06:57,011 --> 00:07:00,053
solution.
In order to do that, you have to go back

91
00:07:00,053 --> 00:07:03,086
to SBT, okay?
So, you open the Command Prompt.

92
00:07:03,086 --> 00:07:08,423
And we see, in fact, we are still in the
Scala shell right now, so we type

93
00:07:08,423 --> 00:07:11,095
Control+D and we are back in the SBT
shell, okay?

94
00:07:11,095 --> 00:07:17,005
Now, to submit your solution, the SBT
shell defines a command which is named

95
00:07:17,005 --> 00:07:20,010
Submit.
The Submit command takes two arguments.

96
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:25,020
The first one is your e-mail address, the
one that you used for registering on

97
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,092
Coursera.
The second argument to the Submit command

98
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:33,038
is your submission password.
The submission password is not the

99
00:07:33,038 --> 00:07:38,078
password that you use for logging in,
instead the submission password can be

100
00:07:38,078 --> 00:07:43,067
obtained at the Coursera website.
So, we go to the Coursera website and we

101
00:07:43,067 --> 00:07:47,036
scroll up and you have to go to the
Assignments page.

102
00:07:47,036 --> 00:07:51,541
On top of the Assignments page, you see
your user name and your submission

103
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:55,221
password.
Again, this is not your log in password.

104
00:07:55,221 --> 00:08:00,616
So, we copy the submission password, we go
back to shell and we paste it.

105
00:08:00,616 --> 00:08:06,672
And now, if you type Enter, your solution
will be packed and uploaded to Coursera.

106
00:08:06,672 --> 00:08:13,041
Finally, in order to see your grade, again
go to the Coursera website, you go to the

107
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:17,109
assignment, and look at the assignment you
just submitted.

108
00:08:17,109 --> 00:08:20,601
I already have a score because I submitted
before.

109
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:25,782
Note that you can submit the same
assignment as often as you like.

110
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:31,484
So, if I click on the Score, I will see
the feedback that I received for earlier

111
00:08:31,484 --> 00:08:34,879
submissions that I did.
So, all the feedback below is for

112
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:39,625
submissions that I did a few days ago.
But you can also see that there is a new

113
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:43,520
submission, which I did just right now,
which has not yet been graded.

114
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,069
Usually, grading takes between five and
ten minutes.
