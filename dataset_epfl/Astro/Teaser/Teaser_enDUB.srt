1
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,330
How is the world are we living in ?
How to study the Universe ?

2
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:18,110
Using the only information we receive from
it:

3
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:21,740
light
The goal of this course it to provide an overview

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:24,730
of the physical concepts
used in astrophysics

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:29,850
to analyze the observations taken
by large ground-based and space telescopes.

6
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:33,910
With these observations, the goal is to imagine
the physical mechanisms

7
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:37,309
responsible for the light radiation we receive
from celestial bodies

8
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:39,820
and for their motion, and to model them.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,570
And of course, as always in science,
one needs to confront theoretical predictions

10
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:45,910
to observations.

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:49,650
The material in this course spans a broad
range of theoretical concepts

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:54,670
which astrophysical applications
play a role at all temporal and spatial scales.

13
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,850
The course is organized as a voyage
from our Solar System to the whole universe,

14
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,860
from stellar formation to galaxy evolution.

15
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,360
To this end, we will use images,
demonstrations on the slidepad

16
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,110
focusing on the links
between theoretical concepts and observations.

17
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:15,240
My name is Frédéric Courbin, I am a researcher
at the Laboratory of Astrophysics

18
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,250
of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology
in Lausanne

19
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,000
where I spilt my time
between research in observational cosmology

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,080
and teaching.

21
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,420
The course I propose here is given to the
students in physics

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,640
in their second year of Bachelor at EPFL.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,030
It consists in the mandatory basis for the
more advanced astrophysics courses

24
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:37,920
but also allows students to see physical phenomena
they may already know, but in a completely

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,990
different context.

26
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:41,680
Prerequisites are minimal.

27
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,680
They correspond to the knowledge
of a first year of university in physics ;

28
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,400
they include trigonometry, simple integral
calculus,

29
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:54,200
Taylor expansions and solving
first order differential equations.

30
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:59,380
However, as we put much more emphasis on the
physical concepts

31
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,920
than on long numerical developments,
the course remains simple and accessible to

32
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,509
most of you.

33
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:09,840
I am looking forward to meeting you very soon
for this introduction to astrophysics.
