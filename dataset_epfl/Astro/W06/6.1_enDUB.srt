00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,480
In this lecture we will have a look at larger
scales

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,820
and explore the world of galaxies.
Here is one of the most beautiful illustration

3
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:16,090
of the diversity of galaxies -
the Hubble Ultra Deep Field.

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:20,910
that we already saw before.
It reveals all sorts of galaxies up to faint

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,660
(large) magnitudes
so it shows very distant galaxies that emit

6
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,050
little light.
It is possible to see galaxies up to a magnitude

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:32,009
of 29.
The image consists of about 10 000 galaxies

8
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:35,630
within an area of about
one hundredth of the surface of the Full Moon.

9
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:39,360
Each of those galaxies contains from about
100 millions

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,070
to 100 billions of stars.
We live in one of some 80 billions of galaxies

11
00:00:44,070 --> 00:00:49,260
that populate the Universe: the Milky Way.
In this video we will look at the various

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:54,210
types of galaxies,
how to study them,

13
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:59,210
and how to understand their formation process.
Let's see how galaxies are characterised

14
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:04,420
through the Hubble sequence.
This is a sequence proposed by the American

15
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:10,210
astronomer Edwin Hubble
at the beginning of the 20th century.

16
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:12,539
The Hubble Space Telescope and the Hubble
law

17
00:01:12,539 --> 00:01:20,740
were named after the same astronomer.
So Hubble established the evolutionary sequence

18
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:24,340
which in fact, as it will be shown later,
is not evolutionary.

19
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:27,590
This is just a morphological sequence describing
the galaxies.

20
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:32,229
There are essentially two types of galaxies:
elliptical and spiral galaxies.

21
00:01:32,229 --> 00:01:37,119
In between, there is an intermediate type
- the lenticular galaxies.

22
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,030
What is going on in this sequence?
The elliptical galaxies, as the name indicates,

23
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:44,840
have an elliptical form and they generally
consist of old stars

24
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,719
with random orbits
around a common gravity centre.

25
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:55,310
"E" stands for elliptical, then there are
7 possibilities for the ellipticity.

26
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:01,310
The type of an elliptical galaxy can be written
as E with an index n

27
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:09,160
that is equal to (1 - A/B ) * 10,
where A/B is the ratio of the semi-major axis

28
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:14,700
and the semi-minor axis.
The ellipticity 0 indicates a circular galaxy

29
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:21,959
while 7 inclides the most elliptical galaxies.
The spiral galaxies

30
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:28,680
form large spiral arms.
Those galaxies are seen face-on. Seen edge-on

31
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,680
they would show a disk component.
Some examples will be shown in a moment.

32
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:44,079
There are two groups of spiral galaxies.
In general, S stands for spiral, then the

33
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:49,150
indices a, b and c depend on
the importance of the bulge compared to the

34
00:02:49,150 --> 00:02:55,120
spiral arms of the galaxy
and the opening of the spiral structure.

35
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,560
Going form a to c there are less spiral arms
and they are less wrapped around each other.

36
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,370
Spiral galaxies,
as was said before, have a bulge

37
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:14,030
that can be seen in the centre.
They also have a disk.

38
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:20,120
It is in the flat disk, seen face on here,
that the spiral arms form.

39
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:27,620
There is also a dark matter halo.
The elliptical galaxies as well have a halo

40
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,560
which by definition cannot be seen as it is
formed of dark matter.

41
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:38,319
The halo will be discussed in the next videos.
The lenticular galaxies were also mentioned.

42
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,750
One can say that those are elliptical galaxies
but possesing a disk

43
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:49,480
through which one can even see dust.
Those galaxies can be compared to the spiral

44
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,830
galaxies
with a large bulge that has the size of an

45
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:55,599
elliptical galaxy.
As it was said before, the Hubble sequence

46
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:02,760
is not evolutionary.
Hubble created this sequence assuming that

47
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,140
galaxies form as elliptical galaxies,
then they evolve progressively toward galaxies

48
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:15,140
with spiral arms
either wrapped around each other

49
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:21,470
or wrapped around a bar.
Here we show barred spiral galaxies,

50
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:30,680
they are named using a S for spiral,
B for barred and then the index a, b or c

51
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,680
which tells us how the spiral arms are wrapped
around the bulge

52
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:41,190
and the bar in this case.
Back to the evolutionary sequence

53
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:46,280
which is not evolutionary
as the elliptical galaxies do not evolve into

54
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:49,220
spiral galaxies,
as it was thought by Hubble.

55
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,819
This is a mere morphological sequence.
Be careful here, the Hubble sequence is a

56
00:04:53,819 --> 00:05:02,340
morphological sequence.
Here are some examples of various types of

57
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,940
galaxies.
Starting with an elliptical galaxy that is

58
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:09,990
quite featureless
surrounded by a group of other galaxies.

59
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:15,759
This particular galaxy
lies at the centre of a galaxy cluster in

60
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,370
which the galaxies orbit
about a centre of mass.

61
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:24,220
Another example, this time a spiral galaxy,
Messier 104

62
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:29,240
that is a magnificent example of a spiral
galaxy Sa with a prominent bulge

63
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,870
that extends almost over the entire galaxy,
a disk is seen inclined

64
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:40,789
in the line of sight and is materialized
by the line of dust across the galaxy.

65
00:05:40,789 --> 00:05:45,569
As it was shown in the previous videos,
dust absorbs the background light.

66
00:05:45,569 --> 00:05:47,990
This is the reason why one can see the stellar
light

67
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:51,070
that is absorbed by the dust in the galactic
disk.

68
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:54,830
Another fascinating spiral galaxy, Messier
101,

69
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:59,759
seen face on, with large spiral arms expanding
from the centre

70
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,740
to the outer parts of the galaxy. One can
clearly see the difference with Messier 104,

71
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:11,050
the bulge that this time is much smaller
as Messier 101 is a Sb type galaxy rather

72
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:14,890
than Sa.
Finally, a barred spiral galaxy NGC 1300,

73
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:19,919
and as its name indicates
it shows a bar that is placed

74
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,970
in the plane of the galactic disk. Like the
disks,

75
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:30,729
bulges consists of stars, gas and dust.
Let's look in detail at the various types

76
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:34,750
of galaxies.
Starting with the elliptical galaxies.

77
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:38,009
One can be seen here, in the centre of a galaxy
cluster.

78
00:06:38,009 --> 00:06:42,780
Quite often elliptical galaxies lie in the
centre of a cluster, but not always.

79
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:48,220
What is the mass range of the elliptical galaxies?
Typically 10^7 solar masses for less massive,

80
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,599
up to 10^13 solar masses for the most massive
galaxies.

81
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:54,940
The most massive elliptical galaxies often,
but not always,

82
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,860
lie in the centre of a galaxy cluster.
They consist of old stellar populations,

83
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:10,150
i.e of the age of about billions of years.
There is little or no gas or dust,

84
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:19,629
so the interstellar medium is quite poor.
There is a little star formation,

85
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:25,780
stars are old with random orbits
around the centre of mass.

86
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:34,919
Taking the cross section of a galaxy
in such a way, one can define the light profile.

87
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:39,340
y axis represents the flux F, x axis the radius
of a galaxy.

88
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,099
This is a typical light profile of an elliptical
galaxy -

89
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:50,479
de Vaucouleurs profile,
after the astronomer that defined this profile.

90
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,729
The flux as a function of radius is equal
to

91
00:07:53,729 --> 00:08:03,510
a normalisation constant times exp - [ ( r
/ re )^1/4 -1 ].

92
00:08:03,510 --> 00:08:07,490
This is a typical light profile of elliptical
galaxies.

93
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,919
re is the effective radius,
i.e. the radius that contains half

94
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:18,979
the total light of a galaxy.
Let's take a look at the spiral galaxies.

95
00:08:18,979 --> 00:08:24,439
In spiral galaxies
there is a disk and extending spiral arms.

96
00:08:24,439 --> 00:08:30,280
Here we have a Sab galaxy, a type intermediate
between a and b,

97
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:37,530
the galaxy Messier 101 seen face on.
The mass range is different for spiral galaxies.

98
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,719
The least massive spiral galaxies are more
massive than

99
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,250
the least massive elliptical galaxies.
However, the most massive spiral galaxies

100
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:48,529
are less massive than the most massive elliptical
galaxies,

101
00:08:48,529 --> 00:08:52,160
10^12 solar masses instead of 10^13 solar
masses

102
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:56,550
as it was for elliptical galaxies.
The sizes are also valid for the elliptical

103
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:59,170
galaxies,
even if the elliptical galaxies are in general

104
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:03,040
a little bit larger,
i.e. about 40 kiloparsec in diameter.

105
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:09,490
This limit is not quite precise
as around the bulge and the spiral arms

106
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:14,700
there is a dark matter halo that is not visible
but the size of which can be estimated indirectly.

107
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,800
In spiral galaxies there is a lot of gas and
dust

108
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:28,260
from which stars form.
There are young stellar populations

109
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:33,320
and a lot of star formation.
In fact, there are two components of the stellar

110
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,060
populations.
The bulge consists of older, less massive

111
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:43,410
stars,
the reddish colour implies that the peak in

112
00:09:43,410 --> 00:09:46,839
the black body
distribution is in the red part.

113
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:54,110
The spiral arms consist of young,
more massive stars that radiate in the blue

114
00:09:54,110 --> 00:10:00,090
part of the spectrum.
What is the light profile of spiral galaxies?

115
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:05,910
Let's take the cross section as before
and look at the luminosity profile

116
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:10,420
starting from the centre.
There would be two components.

117
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:16,510
The disk component curve, so, the flux as
a function of radius,

118
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:26,440
is an exponential curve
F = F0 e^(-R/h),

119
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:32,750
where h is the characteristic height of the
disk.

120
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,089
This is the luminosity profile of the galactic
disk.

121
00:10:35,089 --> 00:10:41,840
On this curve there will be superimposed the
second component: the bulge.

122
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:50,330
Its profile is obviously the de Vaucouleurs
profile,

123
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:56,220
the same that characterised elliptical galaxies
as it was seen before.

124
00:10:56,220 --> 00:11:00,000
This is another spiral galaxy, this time seen
edge on.

125
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:06,769
If one takes a cross section through the disk,
with the flux on the y axis and the radius

126
00:11:06,769 --> 00:11:10,740
on the x axis,
one will find the curve of the same type,

127
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:15,510
an exponential curve with h
as a caracteristic height.

128
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:19,150
Taking the cross section at this point, the
resulting curve will be the sum of the de

129
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:23,250
Vaucouleurs profile
that is characteristic for a bulge or an elliptical

130
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:25,600
galaxy,
and a disk component.

131
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,700
In this case, the measurements are affected
by dust

132
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:33,470
in the galactic plane. If our measurements
were not affected by dust,

133
00:11:33,470 --> 00:11:39,690
the luminosity profile of a spiral galaxy
taken either perpendicularly

134
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:45,750
or along the disk would be an exponential
function.

135
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:50,790
What are the means that can be used
to study those galaxies in details?

136
00:11:50,790 --> 00:11:58,020
There are two ways: through spectra or imaging.
Starting with imaging. This is the bulge of

137
00:11:58,020 --> 00:12:08,410
a spiral galaxy
Messier 83, Sab galaxy.

138
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:12,330
This bulge is caracterised by the de Vaucouleurs
luminosity profile.

139
00:12:12,330 --> 00:12:15,500
Then, there is also a disk component with
a fraction of dust

140
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:20,190
that is seen in absorption.
This is a false colour image

141
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:25,959
taken with three different filters.
The first one is the H-alpha filter that shows

142
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:30,820
the gas
ionized by massive hot stars that are being

143
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,340
formed.
If one is interested in the zones of the star

144
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:40,960
formation
one should look at the red areas whose spectrum

145
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:47,300
can be
presented on a diagram of the flux as a function

146
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:53,490
of the wavelength.
Typical spectrum of those areas is the black

147
00:12:53,490 --> 00:13:00,480
body spectrum with the peak in the blue part
as young, hot, massive stars emit most of

148
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:06,190
the radiation in the blue; then, here we would
observe the H-α emission line.

149
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:12,870
This image was taken using three filters:
blue, intermediate colour and the H-α filter

150
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:20,399
that enables us to see these zones
that are of the size of the Strömgren sphere

151
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,490
which was presented in the lecture on the
interstellar medium.

152
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,420
It is interesting to take a closer look at
the Hα emission

153
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:33,620
of the gas ionized by young stars.
Previously, in the lecture concerning the

154
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,209
colour-magnitude diagram
it was shown that the stellar populations

155
00:13:37,209 --> 00:13:41,040
can be characterised
by referring to the colour-magnitude diagram.

156
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,170
This can be done in the different parts of
a galaxy,

157
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:56,490
for example in this area with some young stars.
Such a colour-magnitude diagram can be created

158
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:00,980
using very high resolution images
taken by the Hubble telescope, for example.

159
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:03,380
One places the flux and colour of all the
stars

160
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,370
from a chosen area on the colour-magnitude
diagram.

161
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:09,880
Then, the main sequence might be visible,
maybe some other structure,

162
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:14,149
but in any case there is a possibility of
characterising the stellar populations

163
00:14:14,149 --> 00:14:18,029
that can be found in the marked area.
Proceeding in the same way for different regions

164
00:14:18,029 --> 00:14:21,079
in the galaxy,
it may be possible to trace back the history

165
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:25,009
of galaxy formation,
in any case the history of evolution of the

166
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:29,149
stellar populations in the galaxy.
All this thanks to some simple measurements

167
00:14:29,149 --> 00:14:32,940
of the flux and colour
of stars in various regions of the galaxy.

168
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:35,860
If the image is taken at lower resolution
and the stars

169
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:41,139
cannot be resolved in those small areas,
it is no more possible to use this method.

170
00:14:41,139 --> 00:14:47,029
In the previous image, a spiral galaxy
taken in three filters in the optical domain

171
00:14:47,029 --> 00:14:52,949
was shown.
Obviously, the observations can be made

172
00:14:52,949 --> 00:15:01,560
at much wider range of wavelengths.
This is Messier 31,

173
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,550
the Andromeda galaxy in the ultraviolet
and in the infrared light.

174
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:15,420
One can see the spiral arms
and a part of the bulge but it is more interesting

175
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:22,540
to take a look at the spiral arms
that are well marked

176
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:31,329
by a great deal of bright points.
In the ultraviolet we can see

177
00:15:31,329 --> 00:15:36,329
hot massive stars
that ionize the surrounding gas and so a lot

178
00:15:36,329 --> 00:15:41,139
of points can be seen
in the Hα emission, as it was shown before.

179
00:15:41,139 --> 00:15:45,190
Looking at the far infrared image,
there is some dust and gas

180
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:50,910
concentrated in the galactic disk
of the spiral galaxy.

181
00:15:50,910 --> 00:16:00,720
Dust absorbs photons
coming from hot stars

182
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:09,350
and then emits a modified black body spectrum
which peaks in the far infrared.

183
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:13,589
One can easily notice that observing in the
ultraviolet or infrared

184
00:16:13,589 --> 00:16:17,360
the same galaxy can give informations about
various components.

185
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,550
In the former case one observes young hot
massive stars in the process of formation,

186
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:25,920
in the latter case one can directly see the
dust.

187
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,389
Obviously, both images are alike
as the stars heat the dust -

188
00:16:32,389 --> 00:16:36,190
physically both components
are in the same place on the image.

189
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:39,709
However, the physical processes that are observed
are not the same.

190
00:16:39,709 --> 00:16:47,420
A multiwavelength study of celestial bodies,
in particular the galaxies, enables us to

191
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:51,560
characterise the stellar populations,
the gas contents, and to learn how those two

192
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:55,839
elements are linked.
Until now, we only studied the images, but

193
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,930
there is also another
important tool that can be used - the spectra.

194
00:16:59,930 --> 00:17:05,250
Those can be used to measure the Doppler effect.
What can be seen here are the Dopper maps

195
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:10,440
of some galaxies.
Colours indicate a radial velocity of the

196
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:16,910
stars
as a function of the position in the galaxy.

197
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:25,140
The red colour indicates
the velocity that is directed away from us,

198
00:17:25,140 --> 00:17:28,310
the blue colour indicates the velocity directed
toward us.

199
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:36,580
Idem for this galaxy.
What can be measured is the velocity of the

200
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:39,900
galaxy
as a function of the radius which in turn

201
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:42,750
is used for
the estimation of the galaxy's mass.

202
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:49,870
This subject will be treated later.
We can write the acceleration of the points

203
00:17:49,870 --> 00:17:54,620
along the rotation axis of a galaxy
as a function of mass.

204
00:17:54,620 --> 00:18:02,800
We have G*M(r)/r²,
that is the gravitational acceleration is

205
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:07,230
equal to v²/r.
This implies that v equals the square root

206
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:13,810
of GM(r)/r.
One can see that if the velocity at each point

207
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:21,240
of the radius along the galaxy is measured
it is possible to calculate the mass within

208
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,230
this radius.
Once more the Doppler effect turns out to

209
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:28,440
be extremely useful,
this time it gives us the estimation of the

210
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:31,530
mass of galaxies,
the mass of luminous matter as well as the

211
00:18:31,530 --> 00:18:37,030
mass of dark matter.
We have discussed various diagnostics during

212
00:18:37,030 --> 00:18:43,840
this lecture: imaging, spectra
and the morphological classification.

213
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,630
This morphological classification is not just
to classify the objects

214
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,410
it is very useful to astrophysicists.
The morphological classification changes with

215
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:57,650
the distance.
The distance is also the age of the Universe.

216
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:01,920
The Universe was created during the Big Bang,
it is expanding.

217
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:06,050
Galaxies further away from us are closer to
the Big Bang epoch,

218
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:09,350
they are younger than the galaxies close to
our own.

219
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:15,320
If we establish a morphological classification
as a function of the distance,

220
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,000
in the same time we establish a morphological
classification as a function of the age of

221
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,230
the Universe.
Observing at various distances,

222
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:29,160
we observe different epochs of the Universe.
Here we have a morphological classification

223
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:32,340
giving
the percentage of each type of galaxy in the

224
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:41,440
local universe:
3% are elliptical galaxies,

225
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:50,150
15% are lenticular galaxies,
72% - spiral galaxies, the majority are spiral

226
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,770
galaxies,
and 10% corresponding to galaxies that we

227
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:57,591
are not able to classify.
This is one of the observational facts, another

228
00:19:57,591 --> 00:20:00,750
one tells us that
if the same observations are obtained for

229
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,890
galaxies further away
the results are not the same. Previously there

230
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:10,790
was 72% of the spiral galaxies
now the spiral galaxies represent only 31%.

231
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:16,260
The galaxies that are not classified represent
32% of the observed galaxies.

232
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,780
These are the galaxies that are
at a different evolutionary stage than in

233
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:25,080
here.
Those morphological classifications can be

234
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,180
established
as a function of distance regardless the theoretical

235
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:32,850
tools
at our disposal used to understand the observations.

236
00:20:32,850 --> 00:20:35,600
It is essential that those theoretical tools
relate

237
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:40,810
at the same time the morphological classification
as a function of the distance,

238
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:45,540
masses determined using the measures of the
Doppler effect

239
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:50,030
and the rotational velocities of galaxies.
They also have to relate to the study of the

240
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:54,670
stellar populations
that uses for example

241
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,630
the colour-magnitude diagrams of the resolved
stars

242
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,670
from various regions in galaxies also as a
function of the distance.

243
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:07,530
Currently, the studies of the formation
and evolutions of galaxies make great progress

244
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:11,390
from the theoretical as well as
observational point of view.

245
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:17,110
We have access to bigger and bigger telescopes
that enable us to study galaxies

246
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:20,890
which are further and further away, as the
telescopes gather more and more light.

247
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:26,970
It is possible to study galaxies
with weaker and weaker intrinsic flux.

248
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:31,880
And it is not all. In addition to large telescopes
there are smaller ones that specialise

249
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:38,280
in detailed cartography of large fraction
of the Universe,

250
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:44,270
maybe even the whole Universe.
It is possible to study large samples of galaxies

251
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:48,730
and with the obtained statistical properties,
from the observational point of view,

252
00:21:48,730 --> 00:21:54,280
and with progress in the data processing
and on the theoretical side as well,

253
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:58,700
one can create simulations of entire "chunks"
of Universe containing

254
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:02,410
billions of particles that are subject to
gravitational forces,

255
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:08,290
pressure and even shock waves
created by supernovae explosions in galaxies.

256
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:14,420
It is now possible to confront theory and
observations

257
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:18,200
and to draw some conclusions about the validity
of theoretical models.
