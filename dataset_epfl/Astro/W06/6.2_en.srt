1
00:00:05,763 --> 00:00:09,000
Galaxies can be formed in various ways.

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,463
 At the beginning of the 20th century, 
Hubble thought 

3
00:00:11,463 --> 00:00:14,831
that elliptic galaxies evolve 
into spiral galaxies 

4
00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:19,194
according to the morphological sequence. 

5
00:00:19,194 --> 00:00:22,307
As it was shown before, this sequence 
is incorrectly called “the evolutionary sequence”.

6
00:00:22,307 --> 00:00:24,755
Now, it is known

7
00:00:24,755 --> 00:00:26,163
 that spiral galaxies 

8
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:27,411
can become

9
00:00:27,411 --> 00:00:28,780
elliptical galaxies

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:31,562
and vice versa. 

11
00:00:31,562 --> 00:00:33,283
Collisions of galaxies 

12
00:00:33,283 --> 00:00:35,705
may play a significant part,

13
00:00:35,705 --> 00:00:37,574
but also that the amount of dark matter

14
00:00:37,574 --> 00:00:39,203
and its kinetic properties 

15
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:42,764
play a crucial role in the formation
and future of a galaxy,

16
00:00:42,764 --> 00:00:45,207
whatever its morphological
type. 

17
00:00:45,207 --> 00:00:48,559
Indeed, the more the matter (dark or
luminous) 

18
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,372
is dynamically cold -

19
00:00:50,372 --> 00:00:55,299
or the weaker the thermal agitation
of particles within a massive object,

20
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:59,248
the larger its ability to collapse easily, 

21
00:00:59,248 --> 00:01:02,677
as we have seen 
through the Viriel theorem 

22
00:01:02,677 --> 00:01:05,624
and the Jeans criteria

23
00:01:05,624 --> 00:01:08,446
so the colder the matter, the greater number 
of compact structures can be formed, 

24
00:01:08,446 --> 00:01:11,001
i.e. galaxies or galaxy clusters.

25
00:01:11,881 --> 00:01:14,322
What can be seen 
in the video is a simulation 

26
00:01:14,322 --> 00:01:18,249
containing 33 millions of massive 
particles interacting with each other 

27
00:01:18,249 --> 00:01:21,696
in a piece of universe 
about 20 Mpc in size, 

28
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:25,830
of which only the central Mpc
is shown. 

29
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,241
The particles represent the gas, 

30
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:33,301
the stars and the cold dark matter,

31
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:36,641
but in the video only 
the gas is shown. 

32
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:39,111
When the simulation 
starts at zero age, 

33
00:01:39,111 --> 00:01:41,270
the universe is almost homogeneous 

34
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:44,172
but next to
the slightly denser regions,

35
00:01:44,172 --> 00:01:46,666
matter begins to collapse, 

36
00:01:46,666 --> 00:01:49,423
nodules and filaments appear. 

37
00:01:49,423 --> 00:01:51,770
In the centre of the image, 

38
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,961
one can see a spiral galaxy being formed, 

39
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:57,153
become stable for a moment - a few billion years 

40
00:01:57,153 --> 00:01:59,889
which is not an insignificant fraction

41
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:02,562
of the age of the Universe, which
amounts to 13.7 billions of years.

42
00:02:02,562 --> 00:02:06,842
Then, interactions with other galaxies

43
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:10,848
almost lead to its disruption 
while passing through the cluster.

44
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,817
Let's take the same 
simulation, zooming now

45
00:02:14,817 --> 00:02:18,363
on the spiral galaxy that lied in the centre
of the previous simulation. 

46
00:02:18,363 --> 00:02:21,274
On the left 

47
00:02:21,274 --> 00:02:25,837
the galaxy is shown face on while 
on the right, the same galaxy is shown edge on.

48
00:02:25,837 --> 00:02:28,743
At the beginning the matter collapses

49
00:02:28,743 --> 00:02:31,676
forming larger and larger clumps

50
00:02:31,676 --> 00:02:34,828
resulting in the formation
of a spiral galaxy

51
00:02:34,828 --> 00:02:36,751
with a nice isolated disk

52
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:38,714
which stays stable for a moment

53
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:40,696
then partially destroyed 

54
00:02:40,696 --> 00:02:42,916
as a consequence of 
interactions with other galaxies. 

55
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:46,250
Then, only the bulge 
of the galaxy remains 

56
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:49,713
while passing through 
a galaxy cluster. 

57
00:02:49,713 --> 00:02:52,223
This video perfectly shows

58
00:02:52,223 --> 00:02:56,520
a multitude of evolutionary scenarios 
for a galaxy, from the very formation 

59
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:59,217
until its possible complete destruction.

60
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:02,462
Lets see now the extreme 
case of galaxy interactions. 

61
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:04,747
In this simulation,

62
00:03:04,747 --> 00:03:06,429
a spiral galaxy

63
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:08,461
is attracted into a potential well 

64
00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:11,034
materialized by the red 
point in the centre of the image. 

65
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:13,868
The galaxy dives 
into the potential well 

66
00:03:13,868 --> 00:03:17,177
and the disk stars 

67
00:03:17,177 --> 00:03:20,930
from all sides of the bulge 
are dragged out then scattered.

68
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:24,055
Only the bulge

69
00:03:24,055 --> 00:03:25,978
survives the interaction.

70
00:03:25,978 --> 00:03:28,245
This video illustrates well

71
00:03:28,245 --> 00:03:31,004
how a galaxy, here a spiral one, 

72
00:03:31,004 --> 00:03:33,354
is destroyed by the tidal forces 

73
00:03:33,354 --> 00:03:35,878
caused by the potential well,

74
00:03:35,878 --> 00:03:37,755
and how the final product of the interactions 

75
00:03:37,755 --> 00:03:40,789
participates in the 
formation of, in this case, 

76
00:03:40,789 --> 00:03:42,734
a compact elliptical galaxy 

77
00:03:42,734 --> 00:03:45,965
from a bulge of a spiral galaxy.

78
00:03:45,965 --> 00:03:48,529
This phenomenon is 
relatively fast,

79
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:52,846
it takes place in the simulation 
in about 1.5 billion years -

80
00:03:52,846 --> 00:03:56,306
a little less than 10 percent 
of the age of the Universe.

81
00:03:57,386 --> 00:04:00,203
A galaxy does not have to interact 

82
00:04:00,203 --> 00:04:02,303
with other galaxies in order to be destroyed.

83
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:05,237
In the regions (locally) dynamically 
colder than others, 

84
00:04:05,237 --> 00:04:07,751
matter may collapse 

85
00:04:07,751 --> 00:04:09,661
and form small nodules

86
00:04:09,661 --> 00:04:13,099
which develop gravitational instabilities 

87
00:04:13,099 --> 00:04:15,937
that might result in the destruction of the galaxy.

88
00:04:15,937 --> 00:04:19,410
 It may occur even if 
a galaxy is completely isolated, 

89
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:21,863
as shown in this simulation, 

90
00:04:21,863 --> 00:04:24,613
where the initial conditions 

91
00:04:24,613 --> 00:04:28,863
are those of an isolated disk of matter.

92
00:04:28,863 --> 00:04:32,143
This condition does not 
prevent the galaxy from being disrupted

93
00:04:32,143 --> 00:04:35,761
due to the gravitational instability.
