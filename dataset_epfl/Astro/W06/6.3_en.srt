1
00:00:05,425 --> 00:00:08,265
The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy

2
00:00:08,409 --> 00:00:10,839
like the one showed here face-on.

3
00:00:11,151 --> 00:00:14,011
It is quite simple to
visualize a galaxy

4
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:16,106
that is seen from the outside,
just like

5
00:00:16,106 --> 00:00:17,816
in the image produced by a telescope.

6
00:00:17,855 --> 00:00:21,405
However, it is much more difficult 
to picture a galaxy

7
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:22,916
while living in it.

8
00:00:22,916 --> 00:00:24,874
This is our case

9
00:00:24,874 --> 00:00:27,524
on Earth, around the Sun,
in the Milky Way.

10
00:00:28,888 --> 00:00:32,318
How to describe the Sun's motion
in the Milky Way?

11
00:00:32,346 --> 00:00:36,236
What are the observables 
we can use?

12
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:38,904
This is what will see
in this lecture

13
00:00:39,144 --> 00:00:41,561
taking the reasoning and the
calculations

14
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:44,882
made by the Dutch astronomer
Jan Oort in 1927.

15
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:48,337
The same Jan Oort who
proposed the idea

16
00:00:48,337 --> 00:00:51,090
of a comet cloud
around our solar system

17
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,330
from which comets originate 
diving toward the Sun from time to time.

18
00:00:58,112 --> 00:01:02,522
It is natural to ask the question whether
our Galaxy rotates as a rigid body

19
00:01:02,538 --> 00:01:03,308
as shown here,

20
00:01:03,313 --> 00:01:05,444
where all the points placed
along an axis

21
00:01:05,444 --> 00:01:08,394
joining the galactic centre
to the outter parts

22
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,420
rotate with the same
angular velocity.

23
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:13,329
The situation is represented
with a the red line

24
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:15,461
rotating around the galaxy.

25
00:01:15,766 --> 00:01:19,916
Or, conversely, our Galaxy may be
in a non-rigid rotation

26
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:21,022
as shown here

27
00:01:21,225 --> 00:01:23,705
where all the points
on the red line

28
00:01:23,705 --> 00:01:27,987
have an angular velocity
that depends on the radius.

29
00:01:28,545 --> 00:01:33,035
We will show that the study of the movements 
of the stars in the vicinity of the Sun

30
00:01:33,353 --> 00:01:35,343
allows us to answer this question.

31
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:38,699
First, a few informations
about the Milky Way.

32
00:01:38,836 --> 00:01:44,584
We are in a spiral barred galaxy SBc

33
00:01:44,584 --> 00:01:47,061
that we can only see
edge on

34
00:01:47,061 --> 00:01:48,341
as we are inside.

35
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:51,960
The total mass of the Milky Way,

36
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:55,324
so the mass of stars, gas,

37
00:01:55,324 --> 00:01:57,464
dust and dark matter

38
00:01:57,562 --> 00:02:02,213
is equal to 1.2* 10^12 solar masses.

39
00:02:02,633 --> 00:02:05,090
The number of stars in the Milky Way

40
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,617
is roughly 1*10^11

41
00:02:11,107 --> 00:02:13,184
How do we find a way
in the Milky Way?

42
00:02:13,254 --> 00:02:18,919
The Sun is about 8 kiloparsecs

43
00:02:19,159 --> 00:02:20,775
from the Galactic centre,

44
00:02:21,365 --> 00:02:27,312
more precisely 8.3 kpc.

45
00:02:27,792 --> 00:02:32,517
The diameter of the Galaxy
is about

46
00:02:33,057 --> 00:02:37,844
31 to 37 kpc depending
on the different estimates available to date.

47
00:02:38,334 --> 00:02:40,435
How do we find a way 
in the Milky Way?

48
00:02:40,555 --> 00:02:45,125
We use a coordinate system 
taking into account the Sun's position

49
00:02:45,125 --> 00:02:46,276
in the Milky Way.

50
00:02:46,586 --> 00:02:51,381
The first coordinate is

51
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:54,171
<i>b</i> - the galactic latitude,

52
00:02:56,531 --> 00:02:57,521
it is the angle

53
00:02:57,521 --> 00:03:00,726
between the galactic plane
and the direction toward observer.

54
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:10,279
<i>b</i> varies from -90º to +90º,

55
00:03:10,359 --> 00:03:14,775
the galactic poles being at +90º et -90º,

56
00:03:14,975 --> 00:03:18,207
<i>b</i> = 0 indicates the galactic equator.

57
00:03:18,997 --> 00:03:21,166
The galactic longitude

58
00:03:21,296 --> 00:03:26,368
can be measured if have a face
on view in the Milky Way

59
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:31,592
with the centre here and
the Sun at 8.3 kps.

60
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:34,106
The angle 

61
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:39,832
between the direction 
Sun - Galactic centre

62
00:03:40,312 --> 00:03:42,067
and the direction of observation

63
00:03:42,317 --> 00:03:45,131
is the galactic longitude.

64
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,596
What we will try to describe now

65
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,607
using this coordinate system

66
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:56,282
with the galactic latitude

67
00:03:56,282 --> 00:03:58,257
and longitude,

68
00:03:58,257 --> 00:04:01,242
as we are placed
in the plane of The Milky Way,

69
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:06,196
is the relative movement of the stars
with respect to the Sun.

70
00:04:06,536 --> 00:04:09,033
Each star has a velocity <i><b>v</b></i>,

71
00:04:09,033 --> 00:04:10,865
this is the Galactic plane,

72
00:04:10,865 --> 00:04:12,377
the Galactic centre in here,

73
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:15,112
stars are at certain distance <i>R</i>.

74
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:18,148
The norm of the vector <i><b>r</b></i> is <i>R</i>,

75
00:04:18,578 --> 00:04:22,249
The Sun is at the distance <i>R0</i>
from the Galactic centre.

76
00:04:23,589 --> 00:04:25,958
<i>θ</i> is the angle between <i>R0</i> and <i>R</i>,

77
00:04:26,088 --> 00:04:29,821
and the galactic longitude <i>l</i>

78
00:04:29,821 --> 00:04:33,982
is the angle between the line
Sun - Galactic centre

79
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,673
and the line joining the Sun and the observed stars.

80
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:38,955
The stars as well as the Sun

81
00:04:38,955 --> 00:04:40,539
have a given velocity,

82
00:04:40,539 --> 00:04:42,977
and what we will study now 
is the relative motion

83
00:04:42,977 --> 00:04:44,652
of the stars with respect to the Sun.

84
00:04:45,102 --> 00:04:47,405
This is the observable that enables us

85
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:50,317
the study of the Sun's 
motion in the Milky Way.

86
00:04:50,867 --> 00:04:55,756
If the Galactic disk is in rotation,

87
00:04:56,266 --> 00:05:00,257
we have that <i>V0 = ω0 R0</i>,

88
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:05,652
for the stars : <i>V = ω R</i>.

89
00:05:06,072 --> 00:05:07,855
If the rotation is that of
a rigid body,

90
00:05:09,815 --> 00:05:15,602
then <i>ω(R) = cste</i>

91
00:05:16,072 --> 00:05:18,209
and equal to <i>ω0</i>,

92
00:05:18,209 --> 00:05:20,306
as all the angular velocities

93
00:05:20,526 --> 00:05:24,412
in the Galaxy

94
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:26,988
are equal to the angular velocity
of the Sun.

95
00:05:27,138 --> 00:05:30,440
The next step is to see

96
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,492
whether the stars' angular velocity

97
00:05:33,892 --> 00:05:35,385
is constant or not,

98
00:05:35,385 --> 00:05:37,896
in other words, does the disk

99
00:05:38,686 --> 00:05:40,525
rotate like a rigid body or not.

100
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:45,009
Different things must be defined, 

101
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:48,592
let's set a Cartesian 
coordinate system

102
00:05:50,162 --> 00:05:51,509
with <i>x, y</i>.

103
00:05:51,749 --> 00:05:54,185
Then, the velocities and radii
will be decomposed 

104
00:05:54,965 --> 00:05:57,034
along the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axis,

105
00:05:57,034 --> 00:05:58,199
so <i>Vx, Vy</i>,

106
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:00,465
<i>Rx, Ry</i>, and so on.

107
00:06:00,835 --> 00:06:03,695
In this coordinate system,

108
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:07,732
<i><b>r</b></i> is equal to the norm <i>R</i>

109
00:06:08,422 --> 00:06:11,749
times sine  <i>θ</i> for the x-axis,

110
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:15,627
cosine  <i>θ</i> for the y-axis.

111
00:06:15,967 --> 00:06:20,296
<i><b>r</b></i> is just projected onto
the x or y axis.

112
00:06:20,756 --> 00:06:24,379
The same is true for the velocity vector,  
it is equal to <i>v</i>,

113
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:27,780
looking at the image one can see that

114
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:30,896
there is cosine <i>θ</i> along the x axis and

115
00:06:31,466 --> 00:06:34,342
minus sine <i>θ</i> along the y-axis.

116
00:06:35,662 --> 00:06:41,040
This is the projection of <i><b>v</b></i> and 
<i><b>r</b></i>  onto  the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axes

117
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,476
using the angle  <i>θ</i>.

118
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:45,213
This angle  <i>θ</i>

119
00:06:45,213 --> 00:06:47,249
is not observed,

120
00:06:47,249 --> 00:06:50,588
the angle that is measurable 
from the Earth is the angle <i>l</i> -

121
00:06:50,588 --> 00:06:52,509
the galactic longitude.

122
00:06:53,219 --> 00:06:57,911
One can notice that this distance

123
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:03,761
is equal to <i>D</i> times sine <i>l</i>,

124
00:07:03,761 --> 00:07:07,166
and so <i><b>r</b></i> can be written

125
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:10,564
for the x axis as:

126
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:13,582
<i>D</i> sine <i>l</i>,

127
00:07:14,382 --> 00:07:20,187
and for the y axis, as the vector 
<i><b>r</b></i> in the <i>y</i> direction 

128
00:07:20,187 --> 00:07:22,532
it is this distance, here,

129
00:07:22,732 --> 00:07:26,568
<i>R0</i> minus that term,

130
00:07:26,868 --> 00:07:33,244
so one has <i>R0</i> minus
<i>D</i> cosine <i>l</i>.

131
00:07:34,024 --> 00:07:36,105
Now we have two expressions for <i><b>r</b></i>

132
00:07:36,105 --> 00:07:42,648
and it is possible to identify the x and y components
of the vector <i><b>r</b></i>

133
00:07:42,648 --> 00:07:44,705
in order to obtain the expressions

134
00:07:44,705 --> 00:07:46,995
for sine  <i>θ</i> and cosine  <i>θ</i>:

135
00:07:47,075 --> 00:07:49,798
by identifying the 2 components
of the vector <i><b>r</b></i>:

136
00:07:49,838 --> 00:07:53,168
sinus <i>θ = D/R sin l</i>

137
00:07:53,408 --> 00:07:55,693
and cosine <i>θ</i> is equal to

138
00:07:55,693 --> 00:08:00,538
<i>R0/R - D/R cos l</i>.

139
00:08:00,538 --> 00:08:02,843
<i>sin θ</i> is equal to this expression,

140
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:04,535
<i>cos θ</i> is equal to this one.

141
00:08:04,535 --> 00:08:07,022
And there is a factor <i>R</i>
that should not be forgotten.

142
00:08:07,432 --> 00:08:12,738
Thanks to this calculation it was possible to 
eliminate the angle <i>θ</i> that cannot be observed

143
00:08:12,738 --> 00:08:16,130
and to replace it by the angle <i>l</i>,
which is more relevant because

144
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:17,888
it is the one that can be observed.

145
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,145
Up to now, the calculations were made

146
00:08:21,145 --> 00:08:23,304
using the Cartesian coordinate system

147
00:08:23,304 --> 00:08:26,686
with the velocity vector for
the <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> axis,

148
00:08:27,076 --> 00:08:32,234
which is nice, since we are used to work 
in this frame.

149
00:08:32,394 --> 00:08:34,816
Unfortunately, these axes are
inconvenient

150
00:08:34,816 --> 00:08:37,195
to measure the velocities
that we are interested in:

151
00:08:37,195 --> 00:08:40,066
the radial velocities -
velocities along the line of sight

152
00:08:40,066 --> 00:08:42,798
measured using 
the Doppler effect,

153
00:08:43,168 --> 00:08:44,754
and the tangential velocities

154
00:08:44,754 --> 00:08:46,769
that are the projections onto
the celestial vault

155
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,275
measured by observing

156
00:08:49,275 --> 00:08:51,466
the stellar motion

157
00:08:51,466 --> 00:08:53,826
over intervals of several years.

158
00:08:55,116 --> 00:08:57,228
Because of that, we change 
the coordinate system

159
00:09:00,378 --> 00:09:04,709
from the Cartesian system (<i>x, y</i>)

160
00:09:04,941 --> 00:09:10,040
to the system  <i><b>a</b></i> and <i><b>b</b></i>,

161
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,562
where <i><b>a</b></i>
represents tangential velocities

162
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:14,833
and <i><b>b</b></i> radial velocities.

163
00:09:14,873 --> 00:09:17,125
This is what will be observed.

164
00:09:18,065 --> 00:09:21,596
In Cartesian coordinates,

165
00:09:22,846 --> 00:09:26,909
in the (x,y) reference frame,
one can express

166
00:09:26,909 --> 00:09:30,708
the velocities with regard to
the Sun's velocity: 

167
00:09:31,228 --> 00:09:34,202
<i><b>v</b></i> - <i><b>v</b></i> of the Sun is equal to,

168
00:09:34,442 --> 00:09:39,693
as the angle <i>θ</i> is here,

169
00:09:39,713 --> 00:09:44,548
<i>v cos θ</i> - <i>V0</i>
for the x axis

170
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,523
and minus <i>V sin θ</i>
for the y axis.

171
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:51,359
One can see that

172
00:09:51,359 --> 00:09:55,385
<i>V0</i> is equal to <i>ω0 R0</i>,

173
00:09:55,925 --> 00:09:59,364
<i>V</i> is equal to <i>ωR</i>.

174
00:09:59,814 --> 00:10:03,299
Then, we have also equations 
calculated before

175
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:07,103
that allowed us to replace
<i>cos θ</i> and <i>sin θ</i>

176
00:10:07,103 --> 00:10:11,397
by <i>sin l</i> and <i>cos l</i> -
the observed values.

177
00:10:11,397 --> 00:10:15,227
If one uses all these equations

178
00:10:15,477 --> 00:10:20,692
it is possible to write the relative velocity
of the stars with regard to the Sun's velocity

179
00:10:21,322 --> 00:10:22,553
in the following way.

180
00:10:22,673 --> 00:10:28,727
<i>R (ω - ω0)</i> minus <i>ω D cos l</i>
for the first component,

181
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:30,796
<i>- D ω sin l</i> for the second component.

182
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:33,208
In this expression

183
00:10:33,208 --> 00:10:38,500
 <i>V</i> and <i>V0</i> were replaced
using <i>ω0 R0</i> and <i>ω R</i>,

184
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:42,091
and <i>θ</i> was replaced by <i>l</i>

185
00:10:42,091 --> 00:10:44,926
using the equations
calculated before.

186
00:10:45,676 --> 00:10:50,476
The equation for <i><b>v</b> - <b>v</b></i> Sun
in the (<i>x,y</i>) reference frame

187
00:10:50,476 --> 00:10:54,424
will be projected onto the 
(<i><b>a</b>,<b>b</b></i>) reference frame.

188
00:10:54,474 --> 00:10:56,612
We use the scalar product so that

189
00:10:57,332 --> 00:11:02,764
<i>Vr</i> - radial velocity

190
00:11:02,764 --> 00:11:06,890
is equal to <i><b>v</b> - <b>v</b></i> Sun
in Cartesian coordinates

191
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:09,804
dot  <i><b>b</b></i> vector,
along the line of sight.

192
00:11:09,804 --> 00:11:13,288
The same for the tangential velocity,

193
00:11:13,288 --> 00:11:16,008
<i><b>v</b> - <b>v</b></i> Sun
in Cartesian coordinates

194
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:19,231
dot <i><b>a</b></i> in Cartesian coordinates.

195
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:23,414
The  <i><b>b</b></i> vector
in Cartesian coordinates

196
00:11:24,064 --> 00:11:28,334
has one component equal 
to sine  <i>l</i>, here

197
00:11:28,544 --> 00:11:30,441
and minus cosine  <i>l</i> here.

198
00:11:31,811 --> 00:11:34,224
This is the vector <i><b>b</b></i>.

199
00:11:34,764 --> 00:11:40,816
For the vector <i><b>a</b></i>
one finds the angle <i>l</i> here,

200
00:11:41,796 --> 00:11:45,736
and so the components are equal to
cosine <i>l</i> and sine <i>l</i>.

201
00:11:45,979 --> 00:11:48,159
Calculating the scalar product

202
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,774
one finds <i>Vr = (ω - ω0) R0 sin l</i>
for the radial velocity,

203
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:56,319
and for the tangential velocity
 <i>Vt = (ω - ω0) R0 cos l - ωD</i>.

204
00:11:58,629 --> 00:11:59,984
Now, we have at disposal

205
00:11:59,984 --> 00:12:03,759
equations for the radial
and tangential velocities,

206
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:06,658
so the velocity of the stars
relative to the Sun

207
00:12:07,138 --> 00:12:09,549
in the coordinate system 
that we are interested in

208
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:12,857
<i><b>a</b></i> for tangential velocities,
<i><b>b</b></i> for radial velocities.

209
00:12:13,157 --> 00:12:16,167
Both are functions of 
an observed angle, 

210
00:12:16,167 --> 00:12:18,513
the galactic longitude,

211
00:12:19,343 --> 00:12:22,133
that is equal to zero when observing 
toward the Milky Way's centre.

212
00:12:22,133 --> 00:12:25,136
In general it takes values 
from 0 to 360º,

213
00:12:25,141 --> 00:12:27,109
or from -180 to 180º

214
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,054
scanning in this way
the lines of sight

215
00:12:30,054 --> 00:12:32,674
running on from the galactic plane.

216
00:12:33,514 --> 00:12:36,911
It is not possible to see stars
in every part of the Milky Way,

217
00:12:36,911 --> 00:12:39,543
in any case, better
measurements

218
00:12:39,543 --> 00:12:40,770
are obtained for stars
close to us.

219
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,160
In the solar vicinity,

220
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:50,573
<i>ω - ω0</i> can be expressed
using a limited Taylor series giving

221
00:12:50,573 --> 00:12:55,554
 <i>dω/dR</i> at <i>R0</i>

222
00:12:56,294 --> 00:12:58,097
times <i>(R - R0)</i>.

223
00:12:58,097 --> 00:13:03,242
This is the first-order Taylor
expansion around the point <i>R0</i>,

224
00:13:03,252 --> 00:13:04,989
so for <i>R</i> close to <i>R0</i>,

225
00:13:04,989 --> 00:13:08,228
in other words when the stars are
relatively near the Sun.

226
00:13:08,898 --> 00:13:10,797
Replacing this into the expression

227
00:13:10,797 --> 00:13:14,006
for the radial velocity

228
00:13:14,346 --> 00:13:20,013
<i>(ω - ω0) R0 sin l</i>,

229
00:13:20,913 --> 00:13:24,512
leads to

230
00:13:24,962 --> 00:13:26,884
<i>Vr</i> equals this expression.

231
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:34,082
This is a new expression
for a relative velocity of stars,

232
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:38,205
more precisely, the radial
component of this velocity

233
00:13:38,475 --> 00:13:39,977
in the solar vicinity.

234
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:43,300
Rewriting this expression once again.

235
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:49,423
We have that 

236
00:13:50,373 --> 00:13:55,046
the angular velocity is equal to <i>V/R</i>,

237
00:13:55,426 --> 00:14:00,140
so deriving this equation gives
the following expression.

238
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,067
Now, we take the derivative
around the point <i>R0</i>,

239
00:14:08,937 --> 00:14:11,537
so this expression at <i>R0</i> times <i>R0</i>,

240
00:14:15,517 --> 00:14:17,697
gives this formula.

241
00:14:18,357 --> 00:14:22,090
It will be replaced in
the expression above

242
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,738
in order to obtain a new equation
for the radial velocity.

243
00:14:26,298 --> 00:14:28,493
This new equation

244
00:14:28,823 --> 00:14:29,990
for  <i>Vr</i> is as follows.

245
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,654
A similar calculation can be made
for the tangential velocity.

246
00:14:41,914 --> 00:14:44,422
These equations

247
00:14:44,422 --> 00:14:46,392
are not the final formulae.

248
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:52,007
We have also that  <i>R0 - R</i>  is small,

249
00:14:52,007 --> 00:14:55,771
so the difference between <i>R0</i> and <i>R</i>,
this length here,

250
00:14:56,261 --> 00:15:00,944
is roughly equal to
<i>D</i> times cosine <i>l</i>.

251
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:06,216
This is valid for small angles <i>l</i>,
or for <i>R</i> close to  <i>R0</i>.

252
00:15:07,586 --> 00:15:10,911
This can be used
to replace <i>(R - R0)</i>

253
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,051
into the equations above.

254
00:15:14,191 --> 00:15:16,025
If this is done one can show

255
00:15:16,925 --> 00:15:21,501
that the radial velocity
is equal to a constant

256
00:15:23,051 --> 00:15:28,773
times  <i>D</i> *sine <i>2l</i>

257
00:15:28,993 --> 00:15:31,422
and the tangential velocity
is equal to

258
00:15:31,452 --> 00:15:38,273
<i>A D cos 2l</i> + a constant times  <i>D</i>.

259
00:15:38,733 --> 00:15:41,758
Those are not just
some constants.

260
00:15:42,148 --> 00:15:47,298
<i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are
the Oort's constants.

261
00:15:48,498 --> 00:15:51,032
They can be written
in the following way.

262
00:15:55,612 --> 00:15:57,556
We know that <i>V</i>=<i>ωR</i>.

263
00:15:58,176 --> 00:16:01,819
One can see that for the rotation 
of a non-rigid body,

264
00:16:01,819 --> 00:16:07,159
meaning that ω depends on <i>R</i>,

265
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:13,349
the term within brackets 
cannot be equal to zero.

266
00:16:13,349 --> 00:16:18,694
In other words, if <i>A</i> is not equal to zero
the rotation is that of a non-rigid body,

267
00:16:20,134 --> 00:16:26,136
and <i>ω=ω(R)</i>.

268
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:32,019
What are the measured values
for <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>?

269
00:16:33,554 --> 00:16:36,379
Measurering
radial and tangential velocities 

270
00:16:36,379 --> 00:16:39,070
as a function of the galactic longitude,

271
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:40,985
can be done by measuring the velocities

272
00:16:41,385 --> 00:16:46,885
on the line of sight using the Doppler effect
and the tangential motion of stars,

273
00:16:47,755 --> 00:16:52,378
one finds <i>A</i> equal to
roughly 14.8

274
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:58,122
km per second and per kiloparsec.

275
00:16:58,612 --> 00:17:01,761
one can see that the unit of  <i>A</i>
is that of an angular velocity.


276
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:06,504
Also form the measurements 
one obtains <i>B</i> equal to - 12,4

277
00:17:07,294 --> 00:17:11,567
km per second and per kiloparsec.

278
00:17:11,957 --> 00:17:14,681
What can be also seen
taking both expressions

279
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:16,631
for <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>

280
00:17:16,649 --> 00:17:22,044
is that <i>A - B = V0/R0</i>

281
00:17:22,434 --> 00:17:24,939
which is equal to <i>ω0</i> -

282
00:17:24,949 --> 00:17:30,075
the solar angular velocity
in the Milky Way.

283
00:17:33,155 --> 00:17:34,659
One can also notice that

284
00:17:34,669 --> 00:17:40,243
<i>(- A + B) = dV/dR</i> for <i>R0</i>.

285
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,448
In other words, a measure of 
the Oort's constants,

286
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:46,757
valid in the vicinity
of the Solar System,

287
00:17:46,757 --> 00:17:49,747
gives the angular velocity
of the Sun in the Milky Way

288
00:17:50,127 --> 00:17:55,031
and the derivative of the velocity
around <i>R0</i>.

289
00:17:56,431 --> 00:17:58,859
This image presents
the results of the calculations.

290
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:03,098
In this animation one can see at the bottom 
a schematization of the Milky Way,

291
00:18:03,098 --> 00:18:04,869
the galactic disk face on,

292
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:11,066
with the Sun placed at a distance 
<i>R0</i> = 8 kpc from the Galactic centre.

293
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:17,005
A star is situated at a distance 
<i>D</i> = 3 kpc from the Sun,

294
00:18:17,005 --> 00:18:19,156
so in the solar vicinity.

295
00:18:19,996 --> 00:18:21,703
At the top of the image

296
00:18:21,703 --> 00:18:24,198
one can see the relative velocity of that star

297
00:18:24,198 --> 00:18:27,276
with regard to the Sun's velocity.

298
00:18:27,816 --> 00:18:30,632
Both radial and tangential velocities

299
00:18:30,632 --> 00:18:33,421
are predicted by the Oort's curves
and the Oort's velocities.

300
00:18:34,091 --> 00:18:37,587
The radial and tangential 
velocities are measured

301
00:18:37,987 --> 00:18:41,857
for stars at all the 
galactic longitudes,

302
00:18:41,857 --> 00:18:43,533
so the stars situated

303
00:18:43,533 --> 00:18:45,561
at different galactic longitudes

304
00:18:45,561 --> 00:18:46,981
in the Galactic plane.

305
00:18:47,341 --> 00:18:51,638
The results completely 
confirm Oort's predictions 

306
00:18:51,638 --> 00:18:54,827
that the rotation of the Milky Way

307
00:18:54,827 --> 00:18:56,827
is that of a non-rigid body.
