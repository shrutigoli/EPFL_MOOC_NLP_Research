1
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,990
Do we see the whole Univers?
In other words, do all massive objects send

2
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,610
us light?
The answer is no. Now it is known that 25%

3
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:20,930
of the mass of the Universe
do not emit any light at any wavelength

4
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,710
so it stays unobservable, even for the largest
telescopes.

5
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:28,630
However, it is possible to detect the presence
of the dark matter

6
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:31,260
in an indirect way, through its gravitational
field.

7
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:35,980
It will be shown in this lecture,
We will look closer at two examples of indirect

8
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:38,450
detection
that are based on the study of the dynamics

9
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:42,030
of spiral galaxies
and on the dynamics of galaxy clusters

10
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:45,540
that enabled us
to reveal dark matter

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:52,989
in the first half of the 20th century.
Let's see how to reveal the presence of dark

12
00:00:52,989 --> 00:00:55,570
matter
in spiral galaxies.

13
00:00:55,570 --> 00:01:01,020
Just before that, how dark matter can be measured?
How is the mass of a galaxy measured as a

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:08,030
function of its light output?
In fact, the mass/luminosity ratio will be

15
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,310
used
expressed in solar units.

16
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:16,200
For example, the mass of an object in solar
masses

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:23,760
divided by the luminosity of the same object
in solar luminosities.

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:34,180
Now, for the Sun:
in solar units, M/L=1

19
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:51,119
and in physical units M/L=5133 kg/watt.
This means that if M/L of an object

20
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:59,990
is larger than M/L of the Sun,
it can potentially contain dark matter

21
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:06,880
so matter that emits less than it does in
the Sun.

22
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,570
In this way dark matter is measured.
Now, revealing dark matter

23
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:15,220
in spiral galaxies:
spectroscopy will be used once again.

24
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:19,810
A spectrum is taken
- the slit of the spectrograph is placed in

25
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:25,099
this way on a spiral galaxy -
and then a spectrum is taken at all points.

26
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:28,130
An image of the slit in all wavelengths is
obtained.

27
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:31,300
as already seen, allowing us to measure the
velocity vector

28
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:37,010
at different radii along the slit.
We will have here velocity vectors in the

29
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:41,090
opposite direction
and the final result is what we call a velocity

30
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:46,670
profile.
What you see here is the radius relative to

31
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:50,650
the galaxy centre there
and the velocity given as a function of the

32
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:56,019
radius.
This is what is called a rotation profile

33
00:02:56,019 --> 00:02:59,629
of a spiral galaxy
and this is what is used to uncover

34
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:05,840
the presence of dark matter in spiral galaxies.
How can that be done?

35
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:13,190
The shape of the rotation curve is drawn here.
Taking only half the rotation curve,

36
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:20,040
one has the radius here, the velocity there,
and a rotation curve which looks like this.

37
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,700
This is what is measured: beware, this velocity
is the radial velocity.

38
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,550
The rotation curve depends
on the inclination of the galaxy with respect

39
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:33,849
to the plane of the sky.
Here you see that one has a velocity Vmax

40
00:03:33,849 --> 00:03:39,150
for a galaxy,
if the latter is inclined by an angle i

41
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,930
relative to the plane of the sky, then the
observed Vmax will be equal

42
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:50,970
to the true Vmax - the circular rotation velocity
of galaxies -

43
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:56,460
times the sine of i, where i is the inclination
of the galaxy on the plane of the sky.

44
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,180
Therefore, the new rotation curve will look
like this,

45
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:06,000
which is V times the sine of inclination.
Beware, one has to select galaxies which are

46
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:11,080
inclined relative to the plane of the sky.
in the picture shown here, for instance, with

47
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:14,360
a face-on galaxy,
one would be unable to measure the rotation

48
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:17,430
velocity.
I have chosen this picture, just to display

49
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:20,620
a spiral galaxy
- it is a nice view of a spiral galaxy -

50
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,000
but actually you need a radial velocity component
i.e. a component along the line of sight,

51
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,780
to measure any Doppler effect.
Hence, one can measure only those galaxies

52
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:31,970
that are inclined
on the line of sight.

53
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,520
Therefore, you need to measure not only the
velocities at each point

54
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:41,030
on the slit, with a spectrograph,
but also measure the inclination of the galaxy

55
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:46,080
with respect to the plane of the sky.
Doing this, one will obtain the observed rotation

56
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:48,410
curve,
the one drawn in red, then correct it to get

57
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:53,880
the true rotation curve
and study the properties of the galaxy.

58
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:58,132
Once we have the observed rotation curve,
let's now see how to relate it to theory.

59
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:04,180
The theory is quite simple:
one can predict the rotation velocity of the

60
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:07,440
galaxy
due to a mass encompassed within some radius

61
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:14,750
r.
We have some velocity here;

62
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,139
for this specific radius, we have a certain
mass and a certain density.

63
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:26,840
The theoretical computation is quick and easy:
the gravitational acceleration is equal

64
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:33,889
to the centripetal acceleration, hence G Mr
(mass within the radius r)/r^2

65
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:41,340
equals V squared over r,
so that V = square root of G Mr/r .

66
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,990
One has somehow predicted the velocity V as
a function of radius,

67
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:51,340
actually giving us a rotation curve.
Rewriting the calculated velocity: v=square

68
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:57,840
root (G Mr / r).
Now, we will consider two situations:

69
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:03,009
we will try to approximate this curve for
the vicinity of the galactic centre

70
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:09,229
and far away from the centre.
At first, the observer is placed in the galaxy:

71
00:06:09,229 --> 00:06:13,380
in this case one uses the approximation made
quite often before,

72
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:23,460
Mr = 4/3 π r cube times density.
If one places it into this equation, the result

73
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,669
will be
v = square root (G times 4/3 π r cube times

74
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:33,539
ro / r).
This means that v is proportional to r.

75
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:36,580
This is the rotation curve near the galactic
centre.

76
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,820
Now, the observer is placed far away from
the centre.

77
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,580
In such a situation, the approximation we
adopt

78
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:46,840
is much more drastic: one squarely considers
M as constant

79
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,860
and introduces it into this equation.
One can immediately see that v is proportional

80
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:58,599
to 1/square root of r.
So we have two parts of the rotation curve,

81
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:01,990
near the centre and far away from the galactic
centre.

82
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:10,180
Let's draw it:
x axis representing the radius,

83
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:16,950
y axis - the velocity.
Hence, close to the galactic centre, the velocity

84
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:21,080
is proportional to r -
it is more or less a straight line, then something

85
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:23,750
happens here
for intermediate radii, then far away from

86
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:28,819
the centre, velocity decreases
as 1/square root of r.

87
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:32,560
To some extent we have predicted the rotation
curve of galaxies.

88
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,199
One also notices that it is quite different
from

89
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,620
the observed curve, like the one sketched
before,

90
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,610
where for small r it was indeed proportional
to r

91
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:47,610
but then flattened off.
What does it mean? It means that, far away

92
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:51,099
from the galactic centre,
we have predicted that as long as mass remains

93
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:58,050
constant while we move away from the galaxy,
the total mass within the radius r does not

94
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,780
increase any more and velocity decreases.
But what is observed it that velocity stays

95
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:07,990
constant,
meaning that there is more mass at large radius

96
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:16,330
than assumed while making our approximation.
Now, we will try to bring this mass out.

97
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,680
Inverting the problem
and writing the equation for the velocity

98
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:26,110
as a function of radius
to get the mass Mr as a function of velocity,

99
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:32,579
radius, and G.
The equation for the rotation curve was simply

100
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:35,690
inverted,
and we have seen that, for observations

101
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:42,450
at large radius, V stays roughly constant.
This is observed in the rotation curves of

102
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:47,240
galaxies:
Velocity decreases as 1/square root of r in

103
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:51,700
the predicted rotation curve
but stays constant according to observations.

104
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:59,189
Taking this into account, one can say that
the derivative d M(r) / d r is equal to v²

105
00:08:59,189 --> 00:09:09,590
/ G
if v does not depend on the radius.

106
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,430
We also have the continuity equation
that tells us

107
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:22,080
dMr/dr = 4π r² ϱ r.
If both equations are combined, one finds

108
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,250
that
ϱr is equal to v² - a constant velocity

109
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:31,190
as the observations show,
/ 4π G times r².

110
00:09:31,190 --> 00:09:37,870
This implies that ϱ decreases with 1 / r².
What is observed is that stellar ϱ,

111
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:47,230
the stellar mass density,
decreases as 1 / r to the power 3.5.

112
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,750
One can notice that the density of stellar
matter decreases faster

113
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,970
than the total density.
It means that there is more mass that is not

114
00:09:54,970 --> 00:09:58,560
seen under the form of stars
and that is needed in order to explain

115
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,630
the flat part of rotation curves at large
radii.

116
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:14,190
Let's sketch this situation:
the x axis represents the radius, y axis the

117
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:18,860
density ϱ.
What we have just shown

118
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:27,200
is that there is a decrease in density as
1/ r².

119
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:35,950
Now, the stellar ϱ is proportional to 1 /r
to the power 3.5.

120
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:43,720
So the observations imply that the mass density
decreases much faster than what is given by

121
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:47,040
the theory which is based on the observations
that indicate

122
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:57,930
v constant with radius.
Rotation curves of spiral galaxies,

123
00:10:57,930 --> 00:11:04,450
showing a flat part at large radii,
indicate that the mass density decreases slower

124
00:11:04,450 --> 00:11:11,430
(as 1/ r²)
than the density of luminous matter.

125
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:16,649
The presence of dark matter was shown
thanks to those rotation curves of spiral

126
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:21,450
galaxies.
Now, what happens in galaxy clusters?

127
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:27,339
Here the situation is quite different:
there are no stellar disks in rotation

128
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:34,090
but there are loads of galaxies, each with
the intrinsic velocity.

129
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:41,700
The motions of galaxies are random.
All those green points have their own velocity,

130
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:49,300
they rotate about the centre of gravity
and so there is a given velocity distribution.

131
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:53,610
There is no longer a rotation curve,
the velocity of galaxies is placed here,

132
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:56,490
and the number of galaxies with certain velocity
on the y axis

133
00:11:56,490 --> 00:12:01,300
- this gives us a distribution that can be
approximated by a Gaussian distribution.

134
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:06,420
This distribution has a dispersion and a mean
velocity -

135
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:15,710
the mean velocity of the galaxy cluster
which can be put as v mean = 0,

136
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,950
the mean velocity can be removed from this
distribution.

137
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:23,160
There are galaxies
rotating about the centre of gravity

138
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:27,899
with some velocity dispersion
that characterizes the velocity distribution

139
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:36,360
in the potential well.
This velocity dispersion: σ ²

140
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:44,690
is equal to v² mean - v mean².
This term is equal to zero, as we cancelled

141
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:51,360
the mean velocity of the cluster,
so the velocity dispersion is equal to the

142
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:59,220
mean value of velocity squared.
One has to pay attention when considering

143
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,190
the spectra of all the galaxies,
what is actually measured is

144
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:10,899
the radial velocity of galaxies
and not the total velocity v.

145
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:15,769
Of course, if we assume that velocities are
isotropic -

146
00:13:15,769 --> 00:13:21,399
all the galaxies go, on average, in all directions
through the cluster of galaxies -

147
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:33,389
this implies that v ² mean = v² radial mean+
v²

148
00:13:33,389 --> 00:13:36,639
with respect to the angle θ in spherical
coordinates,

149
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,950
then v² with respect to the third axis in
spherical coordinates.

150
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:46,480
On average, those three components are equal,
so one has that v squared is equal to

151
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:58,040
3 vr² mean which in turn is equal to the
velocity dispersion squared.

152
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:02,410
What was measured was the velocity dispersion,
not the total velocity dispersion but the

153
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:06,230
dispersion of the radial velocities
measured by the Doppler effect for all the

154
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:11,880
galaxies in the cluster.
The width of this distribution,

155
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,930
in any case the radial component,
is the observable one.

156
00:14:14,930 --> 00:14:20,889
How can it be related with the mass?
It is again the Virial theorem that is useful,

157
00:14:20,889 --> 00:14:26,980
let's see how to use it.
We have, say, n galaxies

158
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:33,019
each of them has a mass m
and velocity v.

159
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:43,620
This si the mass of the cluster
that is, M = N times m.

160
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:47,250
In order to simplify the calculation all the
galaxies are the same.

161
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:54,149
The Virial theorem states that 2 times the
mean kinetic energy

162
00:14:54,149 --> 00:14:59,720
is equal to the mean potential energy.
Developing the expression

163
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:07,230
gives -2 1/2 sum of mi vi ²
- i is the index of the galaxies,

164
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:13,550
it goes from 1 to M -
this is equal to the potential energy of a

165
00:15:13,550 --> 00:15:21,130
sphere:
- 3/5 GM² / R

166
00:15:21,130 --> 00:15:24,040
which is the total potential energy of the
cluster.

167
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,790
Now simplifying the calculation and taking
into account this expression

168
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:40,480
gives 1/N sum over i of vi ² equals 3/5 GM/R.
This term is

169
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:46,790
the mean spatial velocity squared in the galaxy.
It was said that this is the mean kinetic

170
00:15:46,790 --> 00:15:52,230
energy, the time average,
but for a large number of particles,

171
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:58,209
as there are many galaxies in the cluster,
the spatial average is equivalent to the time

172
00:15:58,209 --> 00:16:01,389
average.
This implies that on the left-hand side one

173
00:16:01,389 --> 00:16:11,690
has vi² mean = 3/5 GM² / R,
but also, as it was seen before,

174
00:16:11,690 --> 00:16:24,860
= 3 times vr² mean (isotropy of velocities)
= 3 times σr ²

175
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:29,220
which is the radial velocity dispersion of
galaxies on the line of sight.

176
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:34,110
Now, all one has to do is to replace this
term by this one

177
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,560
and solve this equation.
One obtains an expression giving

178
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:46,340
the total mass of the galaxy cluster.
R is the cluster radius, G - gravitational

179
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,720
constant,
and here one has σr².

180
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:53,949
What does it mean?
It means that if all the Doppler velocities

181
00:16:53,949 --> 00:16:59,800
of galaxies in the cluster are measured,
as well as the radial velocity dispersion

182
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:04,959
and the radius of cluster
- one can see that here it is possible to

183
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:09,000
measure the radius in an approximate way -
then one easily obtains the total mass of

184
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,630
the galaxy cluster.
M is the total mass.

185
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:19,260
The Virial theorem was used
which means that this mass represents

186
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,280
matter that is sensitive to gravity:
dark matter and luminous matter.

187
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:29,910
Now, one only needs to measure luminous matter,
the mass that is in the form of stars,

188
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:33,640
and compare it with the total mass,
the difference or the ratio between those

189
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:39,360
two masses
will indicate the amount of dark matter.

190
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:44,370
We have just seen that an important observable
for galaxy clusters is the radial velocity

191
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:50,180
dispersion
that can be measured using the Doppler effect.

192
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:56,289
One measures the radial velocity dispersion,
obtains the total mass of the galaxy cluster,

193
00:17:56,289 --> 00:18:00,510
compares it with the mass of luminous matter
and what typically will be found for galaxy

194
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,010
clusters
is a mass-to-light ratio

195
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:09,169
of about a few hundreds
in units of solar luminosity.

196
00:18:09,169 --> 00:18:12,510
This was done for the first time by the Swiss
astronomer Fritz Zwicky

197
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:22,360
who in the 30's was working at Caltech, United
States.

198
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,600
So the clues for the presence of dark matter
on the scale of galaxy clusters exist since

199
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,730
the 30's,
even if there is still no explanation about

200
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:34,799
its nature.
For spiral galaxies where it is the rotation

201
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:38,720
curve that is the observable,
the rotation curve is flattened at large radii;

202
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:46,590
if you remember, we had
the predicted curve in this form, while the

203
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:52,890
observed curve showed a flat part.
The difference between those two curves

204
00:18:52,890 --> 00:19:01,160
indicates the presence of dark matter.
The rotation curves were first measured

205
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:10,450
by Vera Rubin in the 60's
and used to reveal dark matter in spiral galaxies.

206
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:19,520
The ratio M/L for spiral galaxies is typically
of the order of 2 to 10.

207
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,330
The study of dark matter is one "hot topics"
in modern astrophysics.

208
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:28,110
What is its spatial distribution?
What is its nature and how it influences the

209
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:32,010
formation
and evolution of celestial bodies around us?

210
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:35,160
The first detections of dark matter were made
in the 20th century,

211
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,660
the 21st century is full of
important observations and experiments aiming

212
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:41,700
at characterizing it in details.
