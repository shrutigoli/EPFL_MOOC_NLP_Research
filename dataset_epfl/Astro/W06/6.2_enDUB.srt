1
00:00:07,769 --> 00:00:10,650
Galaxies can be formed in various ways.

2
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:13,289
At the beginning of the 20th century, Hubble
thought

3
00:00:13,289 --> 00:00:16,329
that elliptic galaxies evolve into spiral
galaxies

4
00:00:16,329 --> 00:00:19,250
according to the morphological sequence.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:24,050
As it was shown before, this sequence is incorrectly
called “the evolutionary sequence”.

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,680
Now, it is known
that spiral galaxies

7
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,790
can become
elliptical galaxies

8
00:00:28,790 --> 00:00:31,640
and vice versa.

9
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,710
Collisions of galaxies
may play a significant part,

10
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,050
but also that the amount of dark matter
and its kinetic properties

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:42,830
play a crucial role in the formation and future
of a galaxy,

12
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:44,970
whatever its morphological type.

13
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:49,580
Indeed, the more the matter (dark or luminous)
is dynamically cold -

14
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:55,309
or the weaker the thermal agitation of particles
within a massive object,

15
00:00:55,309 --> 00:01:02,719
the larger its ability to collapse easily,
as we have seen through the Viriel theorem

16
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,610
and the Jeans criteria
so the colder the matter, the greater number

17
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:11,970
of compact structures can be formed,
i.e. galaxies or galaxy clusters.

18
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,950
What can be seen in the video is a simulation
containing 33 millions of massive particles

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:21,649
interacting with each other
in a piece of universe about 20 Mpc in size,

20
00:01:21,649 --> 00:01:25,850
of which only the central Mpc is shown.

21
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:33,329
The particles represent the gas,
the stars and the cold dark matter,

22
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:35,810
but in the video only the gas is shown.

23
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:41,219
When the simulation starts at zero age,
the universe is almost homogeneous

24
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:46,759
but next to the slightly denser regions,
matter begins to collapse,

25
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:49,469
nodules and filaments appear.

26
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:54,130
In the centre of the image,
one can see a spiral galaxy being formed,

27
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:56,829
become stable for a moment - a few billion
years

28
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:01,779
which is not an insignificant fraction
of the age of the Universe, which amounts

29
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:04,109
to 13.7 billions of years.

30
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:09,170
Then, interactions with other galaxies
almost lead to its disruption while passing

31
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:12,220
through the cluster.

32
00:02:12,220 --> 00:02:17,000
Let's take the same simulation, zooming now
on the spiral galaxy that lied in the centre

33
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,470
of the previous simulation.

34
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:24,860
On the left
the galaxy is shown face on while on the right,

35
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,850
the same galaxy is shown edge on.

36
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:31,970
At the beginning the matter collapses
forming larger and larger clumps

37
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:36,680
resulting in the formation of a spiral galaxy
with a nice isolated disk

38
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:40,740
which stays stable for a moment
then partially destroyed

39
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,330
as a consequence of interactions with other
galaxies.

40
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:49,790
Then, only the bulge of the galaxy remains
while passing through a galaxy cluster.

41
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:55,150
This video perfectly shows
a multitude of evolutionary scenarios for

42
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,590
a galaxy, from the very formation
until its possible complete destruction.

43
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:02,530
Lets see now the extreme case of galaxy interactions.

44
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,370
In this simulation,
a spiral galaxy

45
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:10,480
is attracted into a potential well
materialized by the red point in the centre

46
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:11,480
of the image.

47
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:17,200
The galaxy dives into the potential well
and the disk stars

48
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,090
from all sides of the bulge are dragged out
then scattered.

49
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:26,060
Only the bulge
survives the interaction.

50
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:30,190
This video illustrates well
how a galaxy, here a spiral one,

51
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:35,910
is destroyed by the tidal forces
caused by the potential well,

52
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,130
and how the final product of the interactions
participates in the formation of, in this

53
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,680
case,
a compact elliptical galaxy

54
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,960
from a bulge of a spiral galaxy.

55
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:50,590
This phenomenon is relatively fast,
it takes place in the simulation in about

56
00:03:50,590 --> 00:03:54,870
1.5 billion years -
a little less than 10 percent of the age of

57
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,370
the Universe.

58
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:03,040
A galaxy does not have to interact
with other galaxies in order to be destroyed.

59
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,260
In the regions (locally) dynamically colder
than others,

60
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,440
matter may collapse
and form small nodules

61
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:15,400
which develop gravitational instabilities
that might result in the destruction of the

62
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,400
galaxy.

63
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,500
It may occur even if a galaxy is completely
isolated,

64
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:24,569
as shown in this simulation,
where the initial conditions

65
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:28,919
are those of an isolated disk of matter.

66
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,090
This condition does not prevent the galaxy
from being disrupted

67
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:33,939
due to the gravitational instability.
