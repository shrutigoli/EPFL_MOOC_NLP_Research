1
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:13,209
The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy
like the one showed here face-on.

2
00:00:13,209 --> 00:00:18,000
It is quite simple to visualize a galaxy
that is seen from the outside, just like

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,970
in the image produced by a telescope.
However, it is much more difficult to picture

4
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:25,010
a galaxy
while living in it.

5
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:30,880
This is our case
on Earth, around the Sun, in the Milky Way.

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,530
How to describe the Sun's motion in the Milky
Way?

7
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:40,730
What are the observables we can use?
This is what will see in this lecture

8
00:00:40,730 --> 00:00:47,210
taking the reasoning and the calculations
made by the Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1927.

9
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:53,100
The same Jan Oort who proposed the idea
of a comet cloud around our solar system

10
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,270
from which comets originate diving toward
the Sun from time to time.

11
00:00:58,270 --> 00:01:02,600
It is natural to ask the question whether
our Galaxy rotates as a rigid body

12
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,600
as shown here,
where all the points placed along an axis

13
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,560
joining the galactic centre to the outter
parts

14
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,690
rotate with the same angular velocity.
The situation is represented with a the red

15
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:15,220
line
rotating around the galaxy.

16
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,140
Or, conversely, our Galaxy may be in a non-rigid
rotation

17
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,770
as shown here
where all the points on the red line

18
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:28,710
have an angular velocity that depends on the
radius.

19
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:33,399
We will show that the study of the movements
of the stars in the vicinity of the Sun

20
00:01:33,399 --> 00:01:38,970
allows us to answer this question.
First, a few informations about the Milky

21
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:44,660
Way.
We are in a spiral barred galaxy SBc

22
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:48,890
that we can only see edge on
as we are inside.

23
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:55,530
The total mass of the Milky Way,
so the mass of stars, gas,

24
00:01:55,530 --> 00:02:02,780
dust and dark matter
is equal to 1.2* 10^12 solar masses.

25
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:11,220
The number of stars in the Milky Way
is roughly 1*10^11

26
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,340
How do we find a way in the Milky Way?
The Sun is about 8 kiloparsecs

27
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:27,950
from the Galactic centre,
more precisely 8.3 kpc.

28
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:36,730
The diameter of the Galaxy is about
31 to 37 kpc depending on the different estimates

29
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,720
available to date.
How do we find a way in the Milky Way?

30
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,450
We use a coordinate system taking into account
the Sun's position

31
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,730
in the Milky Way.
The first coordinate is

32
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:57,610
b - the galactic latitude,
it is the angle

33
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:04,040
between the galactic plane and the direction
toward observer.

34
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:14,569
b varies from -90º to +90º,
the galactic poles being at +90º et -90º,

35
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:21,380
b = 0 indicates the galactic equator.
The galactic longitude

36
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,850
can be measured if have a face on view in
the Milky Way

37
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:34,850
with the centre here and the Sun at 8.3 kps.
The angle

38
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:42,400
between the direction Sun - Galactic centre
and the direction of observation

39
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:49,680
is the galactic longitude.
What we will try to describe now

40
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,110
using this coordinate system
with the galactic latitude

41
00:03:54,110 --> 00:04:00,300
and longitude,
as we are placed in the plane of The Milky

42
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,390
Way,
is the relative movement of the stars with

43
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:09,240
respect to the Sun.
Each star has a velocity v,

44
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,890
this is the Galactic plane,
the Galactic centre in here,

45
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,680
stars are at certain distance R.
The norm of the vector r is R,

46
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:22,570
The Sun is at the distance R0 from the Galactic
centre.

47
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:29,880
θ is the angle between R0 and R,
and the galactic longitude l

48
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,160
is the angle between the line Sun - Galactic
centre

49
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,040
and the line joining the Sun and the observed
stars.

50
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,740
The stars as well as the Sun
have a given velocity,

51
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,240
and what we will study now is the relative
motion

52
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,320
of the stars with respect to the Sun.
This is the observable that enables us

53
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,330
the study of the Sun's motion in the Milky
Way.

54
00:04:50,330 --> 00:05:00,200
If the Galactic disk is in rotation,
we have that V0 = ω0 R0,

55
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:09,910
for the stars : V = ω R.
If the rotation is that of a rigid body,

56
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:18,290
then ω(R) = cste
and equal to ω0,

57
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:21,460
as all the angular velocities
in the Galaxy

58
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:30,720
are equal to the angular velocity of the Sun.
The next step is to see

59
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,320
whether the stars' angular velocity
is constant or not,

60
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:42,940
in other words, does the disk
rotate like a rigid body or not.

61
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:50,370
Different things must be defined,
let's set a Cartesian coordinate system

62
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:55,030
with x, y.
Then, the velocities and radii will be decomposed

63
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:58,970
along the x and y axis,
so Vx, Vy,

64
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:04,290
Rx, Ry, and so on.
In this coordinate system,

65
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:13,060
r is equal to the norm R
times sine θ for the x-axis,

66
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:20,910
cosine θ for the y-axis.
r is just projected onto the x or y axis.

67
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:25,100
The same is true for the velocity vector,
it is equal to v,

68
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:31,530
looking at the image one can see that
there is cosine θ along the x axis and

69
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:39,101
minus sine θ along the y-axis.
This is the projection of v and r onto the

70
00:06:39,101 --> 00:06:43,520
x and y axes
using the angle θ.

71
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,420
This angle θ
is not observed,

72
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:50,500
the angle that is measurable from the Earth
is the angle l -

73
00:06:50,500 --> 00:07:00,150
the galactic longitude.
One can notice that this distance

74
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:07,710
is equal to D times sine l,
and so r can be written

75
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:13,180
for the x axis as:
D sine l,

76
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:19,370
and for the y axis, as the vector r in the
y direction

77
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:27,050
it is this distance, here,
R0 minus that term,

78
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:36,180
so one has R0 minus D cosine l.
Now we have two expressions for r

79
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:42,840
and it is possible to identify the x and y
components of the vector r

80
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:47,020
in order to obtain the expressions
for sine θ and cosine θ:

81
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:50,490
by identifying the 2 components of the vector
r:

82
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,300
sinus θ = D/R sin l
and cosine θ is equal to

83
00:07:55,300 --> 00:08:02,199
R0/R - D/R cos l.
sin θ is equal to this expression,

84
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:06,850
cos θ is equal to this one.
And there is a factor R that should not be

85
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:09,670
forgotten.
Thanks to this calculation it was possible

86
00:08:09,670 --> 00:08:15,200
to eliminate the angle θ that cannot be observed
and to replace it by the angle l, which is

87
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,180
more relevant because
it is the one that can be observed.

88
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:23,370
Up to now, the calculations were made
using the Cartesian coordinate system

89
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:29,449
with the velocity vector for the x and y axis,
which is nice, since we are used to work in

90
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:35,190
this frame.
Unfortunately, these axes are inconvenient

91
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:37,769
to measure the velocities that we are interested
in:

92
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:40,800
the radial velocities - velocities along the
line of sight

93
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,009
measured using the Doppler effect,
and the tangential velocities

94
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:47,350
that are the projections onto the celestial
vault

95
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:50,370
measured by observing
the stellar motion

96
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:57,240
over intervals of several years.
Because of that, we change the coordinate

97
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:05,089
system
from the Cartesian system (x, y)

98
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:12,920
to the system a and b,
where a represents tangential velocities

99
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,990
and b radial velocities.
This is what will be observed.

100
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:25,679
In Cartesian coordinates,
in the (x,y) reference frame, one can express

101
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:34,439
the velocities with regard to the Sun's velocity:
v - v of the Sun is equal to,

102
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:45,119
as the angle θ is here,
v cos θ - V0 for the x axis

103
00:09:45,119 --> 00:09:49,709
and minus V sin θ for the y axis.
One can see that

104
00:09:49,709 --> 00:09:58,540
V0 is equal to ω0 R0,
V is equal to ωR.

105
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:06,269
Then, we have also equations calculated before
that allowed us to replace cos θ and sin

106
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:10,959
θ
by sin l and cos l - the observed values.

107
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,910
If one uses all these equations
it is possible to write the relative velocity

108
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:22,589
of the stars with regard to the Sun's velocity
in the following way.

109
00:10:22,589 --> 00:10:29,100
R (ω - ω0) minus ω D cos l for the first
component,

110
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:32,279
- D ω sin l for the second component.
In this expression

111
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:37,139
V and V0 were replaced using ω0 R0 and ω
R,

112
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:45,759
and θ was replaced by l
using the equations calculated before.

113
00:10:45,759 --> 00:10:50,499
The equation for v - v Sun in the (x,y) reference
frame

114
00:10:50,499 --> 00:10:54,629
will be projected onto the (a,b) reference
frame.

115
00:10:54,629 --> 00:11:02,829
We use the scalar product so that
Vr - radial velocity

116
00:11:02,829 --> 00:11:09,959
is equal to v - v Sun in Cartesian coordinates
dot b vector, along the line of sight.

117
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:16,379
The same for the tangential velocity,
v - v Sun in Cartesian coordinates

118
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:21,820
dot a in Cartesian coordinates.
The b vector in Cartesian coordinates

119
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:31,990
has one component equal to sine l, here
and minus cosine l here.

120
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:41,980
This is the vector b.
For the vector a one finds the angle l here,

121
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:46,529
and so the components are equal to cosine
l and sine l.

122
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:52,809
Calculating the scalar product
one finds Vr = (ω - ω0) R0 sin l for the

123
00:11:52,809 --> 00:11:57,279
radial velocity,
and for the tangential velocity Vt = (ω - ω0)

124
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:01,249
R0 cos l - ωD.
Now, we have at disposal

125
00:12:01,249 --> 00:12:06,790
equations for the radial and tangential velocities,
so the velocity of the stars relative to the

126
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,189
Sun
in the coordinate system that we are interested

127
00:12:09,189 --> 00:12:12,730
in
a for tangential velocities, b for radial

128
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:16,259
velocities.
Both are functions of an observed angle,

129
00:12:16,259 --> 00:12:21,449
the galactic longitude,
that is equal to zero when observing toward

130
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:26,100
the Milky Way's centre.
In general it takes values from 0 to 360º,

131
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,119
or from -180 to 180º
scanning in this way the lines of sight

132
00:12:30,119 --> 00:12:36,040
running on from the galactic plane.
It is not possible to see stars in every part

133
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,489
of the Milky Way,
in any case, better measurements

134
00:12:39,489 --> 00:12:44,420
are obtained for stars close to us.
In the solar vicinity,

135
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:48,640
ω - ω0 can be expressed using a limited
Taylor series giving

136
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:58,579
dω/dR at R0
times (R - R0).

137
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:03,440
This is the first-order Taylor expansion around
the point R0,

138
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:07,490
so for R close to R0,
in other words when the stars are relatively

139
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:10,839
near the Sun.
Replacing this into the expression

140
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:21,029
for the radial velocity
(ω - ω0) R0 sin l,

141
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:30,199
leads to
Vr equals this expression.

142
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:34,249
This is a new expression for a relative velocity
of stars,

143
00:13:34,249 --> 00:13:38,679
more precisely, the radial component of this
velocity

144
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:47,309
in the solar vicinity.
Rewriting this expression once again.

145
00:13:47,309 --> 00:13:55,610
We have that
the angular velocity is equal to V/R,

146
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:00,740
so deriving this equation gives the following
expression.

147
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:09,119
Now, we take the derivative around the point
R0,

148
00:14:09,119 --> 00:14:16,649
so this expression at R0 times R0,
gives this formula.

149
00:14:16,649 --> 00:14:24,209
It will be replaced in the expression above
in order to obtain a new equation for the

150
00:14:24,209 --> 00:14:28,889
radial velocity.
This new equation

151
00:14:28,889 --> 00:14:35,600
for Vr is as follows.
A similar calculation can be made for the

152
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:44,609
tangential velocity.
These equations

153
00:14:44,609 --> 00:14:52,189
are not the final formulae.
We have also that R0 - R is small,

154
00:14:52,189 --> 00:14:56,339
so the difference between R0 and R, this length
here,

155
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:04,759
is roughly equal to D times cosine l.
This is valid for small angles l, or for R

156
00:15:04,759 --> 00:15:11,110
close to R0.
This can be used to replace (R - R0)

157
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:16,999
into the equations above.
If this is done one can show

158
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:29,179
that the radial velocity is equal to a constant
times D *sine 2l

159
00:15:29,179 --> 00:15:35,189
and the tangential velocity is equal to
A D cos 2l + a constant times D.

160
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:46,350
Those are not just some constants.
A and B are the Oort's constants.

161
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:58,379
They can be written in the following way.
We know that V=ωR.

162
00:15:58,379 --> 00:16:00,999
One can see that for the rotation of a non-rigid
body,

163
00:16:00,999 --> 00:16:09,290
meaning that ω depends on R,
the term within brackets cannot be equal to

164
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:16,029
zero.
In other words, if A is not equal to zero

165
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:28,699
the rotation is that of a non-rigid body,
and ω=ω(R).

166
00:16:28,699 --> 00:16:36,470
What are the measured values for A and B?
Measurering radial and tangential velocities

167
00:16:36,470 --> 00:16:41,449
as a function of the galactic longitude,
can be done by measuring the velocities

168
00:16:41,449 --> 00:16:48,009
on the line of sight using the Doppler effect
and the tangential motion of stars,

169
00:16:48,009 --> 00:16:58,869
one finds A equal to roughly 14.8
km per second and per kiloparsec.

170
00:16:58,869 --> 00:17:02,769
one can see that the unit of A is that of
an angular velocity.

171
00:17:02,769 --> 00:17:06,720
Also form the measurements one obtains B equal
to - 12,4

172
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:14,750
km per second and per kiloparsec.
What can be also seen taking both expressions

173
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:22,580
for A and B
is that A - B = V0/R0

174
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:33,350
which is equal to ω0 -
the solar angular velocity in the Milky Way.

175
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:40,800
One can also notice that
(- A + B) = dV/dR for R0.

176
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:46,960
In other words, a measure of the Oort's constants,
valid in the vicinity of the Solar System,

177
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,070
gives the angular velocity of the Sun in the
Milky Way

178
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:56,640
and the derivative of the velocity around
R0.

179
00:17:56,640 --> 00:18:01,520
This image presents the results of the calculations.
In this animation one can see at the bottom

180
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,250
a schematization of the Milky Way,
the galactic disk face on,

181
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:10,370
with the Sun placed at a distance R0 = 8 kpc
from the Galactic centre.

182
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:17,230
A star is situated at a distance D = 3 kpc
from the Sun,

183
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:21,550
so in the solar vicinity.
At the top of the image

184
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:24,200
one can see the relative velocity of that
star

185
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:30,690
with regard to the Sun's velocity.
Both radial and tangential velocities

186
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:34,220
are predicted by the Oort's curves and the
Oort's velocities.

187
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:42,060
The radial and tangential velocities are measured
for stars at all the galactic longitudes,

188
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:45,620
so the stars situated
at different galactic longitudes

189
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,870
in the Galactic plane.
The results completely confirm Oort's predictions

190
00:18:49,870 --> 00:18:56,400
that the rotation of the Milky Way
is that of a non-rigid body.
