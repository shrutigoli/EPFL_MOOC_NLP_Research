00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,600
This chapter presents the three Kepler's laws
describing the motion of objects in the solar

2
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:14,360
system
and by extension in every planetary and stellar

3
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:17,910
system.
They related in a simple way the masses of

4
00:00:17,910 --> 00:00:21,090
the interacting bodies
to the shape of their orbit

5
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:27,050
and to the typical travel times on these orbits,
namely the orbital periods.

6
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,940
Kepler's laws are the result of the work of
a great observer

7
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:34,090
and mathematician.
They were deducted from the observations of

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,040
danish Tycho Brahe,
an astronomer with quite a sturdy character,

9
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,870
strong advocate of the geocentric view of
the Universe

10
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:46,670
Tycho Brahe worked from the island of Ven
in front of Copenhagen,

11
00:00:46,670 --> 00:00:50,829
that king Frederick II bequeathed to him
to create an observatory :

12
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:56,680
Uraniborg, dedicated to the Muse of Astronomy.
He was the last astronomer before the era

13
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,410
of telescopes.
He mapped the sky with an extreme precision

14
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,150
for the time
using sextants and astrolabes.

15
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,450
He even took into account the atmospheric
refraction,

16
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:14,420
an apparent displacement of stars on the sky
due to the refraction of light rays

17
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,630
by the the Earth's atmosphere.
In 1600, Kepler became Tycho Brahe's assistant

18
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:25,430
who asked him to compute Mars' orbit.
As opposed to Brahe,

19
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:28,200
Kepler supported the model of a heliocentric
universe

20
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,180
which was a source of disagreement between
them

21
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:36,270
and slowed down the work of Kepler.
His work took him six years and was published

22
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:41,939
in 1609.
Later, Newton theories built a framework around

23
00:01:41,939 --> 00:01:46,170
Kepler's law
which were until then only a purely mathematical

24
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,470
description
of Brahe's observations.

25
00:01:48,470 --> 00:01:53,350
Newton's law of gravitation thus became the
theory behind

26
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:58,479
the trajectories described by Kepler in the
framework of heliocentrism.

27
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:03,470
Note by the way that Newton was absolutely
not a contemporary

28
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:07,380
of neither Kepler nor Brahe,
who therefore worked without any knowledge

29
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:12,040
of the law of gravitation.
What do Kepler's laws say ?

30
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,380
The first one tells us that planets follow
flat and elliptical

31
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:21,780
trajectories with the Sun at one of the foci.
The second one tells us that the radius vectors

32
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,700
sweep out equal
areas during equals intervals of time.

33
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,220
Finally, the third one, maybe the most important
in regard to astrophysics, tells us that the

34
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,370
square of the orbital period
is proportional to the cube of the semi-major

35
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,830
axis of its orbit.
Now back to the first Kepler's law.

36
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,579
We will not prove here that the orbits are
elliptical

37
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:47,220
but we will quickly show that the orbits are
flat.

38
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,959
To this end, we will write the angular momentum
: m v cross r

39
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:58,560
where v is the velocity vector and r the radius
vector.

40
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,930
Lets take the derivatives of this angular
momentum with respect to time.

41
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:12,400
We immediately see here the velocity vector.
This vector is obviously colinear with itself

42
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,989
and therefore this whole expression vanishes.
As we have a radial force, we recognise here

43
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:23,010
the derivative
of a momentum with respect to time.

44
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:30,780
We thus have a central force
which is colinear with the radius vector.

45
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:36,810
This means that F being parallel to r, this
expression here vanishes.

46
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:44,109
We have then shown that the time derivative
of the angular momentum

47
00:03:44,109 --> 00:03:50,030
is equal to zero, so L has a constant norm
and direction with time.

48
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:57,859
Therefore, the orbit lies on a plane.
Kepler's second law tells us that

49
00:03:57,859 --> 00:04:03,049
the radius vectors sweep out equal areas during
equal intervals of time.

50
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:09,989
Here is a small surface element between two
instants

51
00:04:09,989 --> 00:04:22,160
while the Earth moves along its orbit.
We have a triangle with its altitude here.

52
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:30,980
We now seek to compute this area.
We have here the altitude of the triangle,

53
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:38,210
the radius vector here, Earth's velocity
with a certain angle with respect to the tangent

54
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:47,759
to its orbit.
We will call this surface element dA.

55
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:55,300
We then have that dA is equal to the radius
vector, which is also the base of the triangle,

56
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:59,250
times half the altitude.
Let us express the altitude in terms of known

57
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:02,780
quantities :
the velocity, the angle and the time element

58
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:08,539
to travel this small distance
along Earth's orbit.

59
00:05:08,539 --> 00:05:19,669
We factor out the r/2.
The altitude is v.dt times the sine of the

60
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:23,900
angle.
We immediately see that the norm of the angular

61
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:30,900
momentum,
which is m v r sin(theta), shows up here up

62
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:39,240
to a factor m.
We can thus rewrite the surface element in

63
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:45,530
this way.
Here is the norm of the angular momentum which

64
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:50,780
we
proved previously to be constant, over 2m

65
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:57,009
times dt.
We now simply have to integrate this in order

66
00:05:57,009 --> 00:06:01,900
to get the area, which
we will express as a function of time.

67
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:07,490
We can derive the value of this constant with
the boundary condition that,

68
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:16,500
if t equals a full period, then A(t) is the
surface of the ellipse, pi ab

69
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:25,259
where a and b are the semi-major, respectively
the semi-minor axis.

70
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,569
This allows to compute exactly the value of
the constant.

71
00:06:29,569 --> 00:06:39,490
Between two times t1 and t2, we have that
A(t1) - A(t2)

72
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:47,580
is equal to the norm of the angular momentum
over 2m times delta t,

73
00:06:47,580 --> 00:07:03,010
where delta t = t2 - t1.
We have thus proved the second law.

74
00:07:03,010 --> 00:07:07,509
For any t1 and t2, what is important is the
value of delta t,

75
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:15,499
namely the time interval between the two observations.
We can see this here.

76
00:07:15,499 --> 00:07:23,729
If I draw a radius vector here and another
one here,

77
00:07:23,729 --> 00:07:29,300
the surface swept out by this radius vector
must be the same that the one swept out by

78
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:35,249
the radius vectors
between the same times t1 and t2.

79
00:07:35,249 --> 00:07:41,580
I am here further away on the orbit so the
covered angle will be smaller.

80
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:51,389
Here is a time t2, and the other t2 is here.
We have delta t here, and the same delta t

81
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:58,590
here.
So the area swept out here is the same one

82
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:06,490
as the area swept out there.
This implies that the bodies further away

83
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:12,040
on their orbit
are slower. Their tangential speed along their

84
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:16,830
orbit is smaller
when further away from the body that attracts

85
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:19,909
them,
the Sun in this specific case,

86
00:08:19,909 --> 00:08:24,150
than when the Earth here is closer to the
Sun.

87
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:34,430
We finally see that the surface A1 here is
equal to the surface A2.

88
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:39,169
This is for the second law.
Kepler's third law.

89
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:42,469
This law states that the square of the orbital
period

90
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:46,790
is proportional to the cube of the semi-major
axis of the orbit.

91
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52,529
We will now prove this law in the case of
circular orbits.

92
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:58,160
Let us consider a system of two bodies with
masses m1 and m2 orbiting around

93
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,519
a common centre of gravity at distances r1
and r2.

94
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:09,149
The gravitational force that 1 exerts on 2
is of course

95
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:16,930
equal to minus the force by 2 on 1.
Its value is G m1 m2 over the distance between

96
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:23,670
the two bodies,
that is r1 + r2 squared.

97
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:32,070
This is simply Newton's law. I can multiply
this equation

98
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:39,500
by any quantity.
I have here multiplied the top and bottom

99
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:45,790
part by the same quantity.
I can now rearrange the terms

100
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:53,410
for example by grouping these terms here.
This term is the total mass of the system

101
00:09:53,410 --> 00:10:04,839
and this is another mass, which we write mu,
the reduced mass of the system.

102
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,690
With these new definitions, the gravitational
force is rewritten as

103
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:27,260
G M mu / (r1 + r2)²
with mu being the reduced mass.

104
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:33,880
This is equivalent to a mass mu orbiting around
the mass M

105
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:38,339
at a distance of r1 + r2.
This situation is represented here.

106
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:44,009
We have here mu that orbits at a distance
r1 + r2 around a virtual mass M

107
00:10:44,009 --> 00:10:48,140
that would have the total mass of the planetary
system.

108
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:52,699
We have thus reduced problem of the motion
of two bodies

109
00:10:52,699 --> 00:10:56,990
around a common centre of gravity
to the motion of a body mu, with virtual mass

110
00:10:56,990 --> 00:11:00,440
mu,
around another virtual body which has a mass

111
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,880
equal
to the sum of the masses of the two bodies

112
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:08,649
in the planetary system.
The distance between these two virtual bodies

113
00:11:08,649 --> 00:11:14,070
is the same as here :
r1 + r2.

114
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:18,160
Let us now consider the acceleration of the
mass mu due to mass M

115
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:26,180
in the case of a circular orbit.
We call it a_mu.

116
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:35,190
It is equal to the angular velocity squared
times r1 + r2.

117
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:46,570
According to Newton's law, it is also equal
to G M / (r1 + r2)²

118
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:52,769
On the other hand, omega is equal to 2 pi
over the orbital period

119
00:11:52,769 --> 00:11:59,519
and we can thus substitute omega here,
omega_mu and P_mu.

120
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:08,199
I therefore get 4 pi² / P² = G M / (r1 +
r2)³

121
00:12:08,199 --> 00:12:33,790
In other words, P² / (r1 + r2)³ = 4 pi²
/ G M

122
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:39,940
This is the distance r.
In the case where the mass m1 is much larger

123
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:48,420
than m2,
then the total mass M is approximately m1.

124
00:12:48,420 --> 00:12:53,259
The centre of gravity of the system will be
inside m1,

125
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:58,480
almost at the centre of m1.
We have thus that r is approximately equal

126
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:05,389
to r1.
We can therefore rewrite this as P²/r³ = 4

127
00:13:05,389 --> 00:13:16,399
pi² / G M
which is Kepler's third law.

128
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:21,860
We note that this law
does not depend on the eccentricity of the

129
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,449
orbit,
defined as 1 - (b/a)²  where

130
00:13:25,449 --> 00:13:31,509
b, a are the semi-minor, respectively the
semi-major axis of the orbit.

131
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:36,959
This means that orbits with different eccentricities
have the same orbital period as long as the

132
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:44,070
semi-major axis of the orbit
and the mass of the main body are set.

133
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:49,720
As a final note, if we express the semi-major
axis of the orbit

134
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,089
in astronomical units, that is 150 millions
of kilometres,

135
00:13:54,089 --> 00:14:00,870
and in the case of the Earth, a = 1,
since 150 million of kilometres is the distance

136
00:14:00,870 --> 00:14:04,300
from Earth to the Sun,
and if the period is expressed in terrestrial

137
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:07,860
years,
then P = 1. We have thus renormalized the

138
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:14,220
units
of Kepler's third law in such a way that

139
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:22,290
P²/a³ = 1 in the appropriate units.
This is a very useful relation in the case

140
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:28,420
of the solar system.
This ends our chapter on Kepler's laws.

141
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:34,329
We will meet them many times during this course,
in particular in the description

142
00:14:34,329 --> 00:14:39,509
of the shape of cometary tails,
in the expression of tidal forces acting on

143
00:14:39,509 --> 00:14:42,959
the Earth and the Moon
for example, and of course in the search for

144
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:43,519
exoplanets.
