00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,080
We present here four videos with numerical
simulations

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:13,230
illustrating the time evolution
of an isolated self-gravitating system of

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:16,090
particles,
in other words only influenced by its own

4
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:17,560
gravitational force.

5
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,029
In the following simulations
we used a limited number of particles :

6
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:25,651
8000 particles, shown
in the upper part of the simulation, with

7
00:00:25,651 --> 00:00:29,070
an enlargement
in the right part of the simulation.

8
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:34,820
At each instant between each video frame,
all the gravitational forces between the particles

9
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:38,050
are computed
in order to predict at each time the position

10
00:00:38,050 --> 00:00:42,520
and the velocity of each particle
and to let evolve with time several quantities

11
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:45,940
such as
the virial, the kinetic energy, the potential

12
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:48,360
energy and the total energy.

13
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,580
Lets evolve the system over time.

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,010
In each following footage,
the initial positions of all the particles

15
00:00:55,010 --> 00:00:56,989
are strictly the sames.

16
00:00:56,989 --> 00:01:01,860
Only the velocities, that is the kinetic energy,
changes.

17
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:05,740
In each simulation we show in the bottom part
of the video

18
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:12,700
the kinetic energy in green,
the potential energy in red

19
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:15,900
and their sum, the total energy in white.

20
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,530
As for the virial, i.e., twice the kinetic
energy

21
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:22,950
plus the potential energy, it is shown in
blue.

22
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:27,030
We first see that in such a system, completely
isolated,

23
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:33,390
that the total energy is always exactly conserved
up to numerical errors, up to the accuracy

24
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,820
of the simulation.

25
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:39,030
The potential energy plus twice the kinetic
energy,

26
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:44,549
namely the virial,
oscillates indeed around 0 over time.

27
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:47,829
Lets see what happens now if the system is
not isolated anymore ?

28
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:51,509
We introduce an external perturbation to the
system

29
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:54,800
which affects the shape of the self-gravitating
system,

30
00:01:54,800 --> 00:02:00,250
which actually isn't self-graviting anymore,
and affects the physical quantities we measure.

31
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:05,219
The physical quantities are in the lower part
and the system still in the upper part.

32
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:08,979
We see that under the effect of an external
perturbation

33
00:02:08,979 --> 00:02:14,730
the system deforms over time
and we also see that the total energy increases.

34
00:02:14,730 --> 00:02:20,300
The virial does not oscillate around zero
anymore

35
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,890
but also tends to increase.

36
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:28,720
In this specific case
we tend to add up kinetic energy to the system

37
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,230
through the external perturbation.

38
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:36,120
Now let us go back to an isolated system,
that is without external gravitational field

39
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:37,120
anymore.

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:42,620
We will set initial conditions
such that the kinetic energy is too low to

41
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,690
counterbalance the potential energy.

42
00:02:44,690 --> 00:02:48,190
In such a case,
the total energy is of course conserved over

43
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:50,989
time
since the system is isolated.

44
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:57,459
What happens is that the system has to contract
to make a sudden increase of the kinetic energy

45
00:02:57,459 --> 00:03:00,130
at the beginning of the simulation.

46
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:03,349
In order to gain kinetic energy, we lose potential
energy,

47
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:09,459
and to lose potential energy the system contracts
until reaching an equilibrium after a some

48
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:12,709
time
where the virial oscillates around zero.

49
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:17,150
The system was initially too big for its kinetic
energy and

50
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:19,750
as such contracted itself to reach a new equilibrium.

51
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:26,190
In a similar way, if we take an isolated system
but this time with too much kinetic energy

52
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:29,790
in regards to potential energy
then the kinetic and potential energies

53
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:33,190
will balance each other
as seen here.

54
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:39,549
The kinetic energy decreases over time,
the potential energy increases over time,

55
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:42,959
the total energy is conserved
since the system is isolated

56
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,040
and the virial will naturally converge to
a mean value of zero

57
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,819
after a some time.

58
00:03:48,819 --> 00:03:54,709
As opposed to the previous simulation,
the system will grow in size contrary to the

59
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:57,599
contraction observed previously.

60
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,810
The numerical simulations shown here
only use a limited number of particles

61
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:06,560
yet enough to illustrate the time evolution
of a self-graviting system.

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:11,410
However, they only take into account the gravitational
forces between the particles.

63
00:04:11,410 --> 00:04:15,970
Other numerical simulations can be used
to understand the formation and evolution

64
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:16,970
of galaxies.

65
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:20,650
They can include up to hundreds of billions
of particles

66
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:24,250
as well as the physics of gas surrounding
the particles

67
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,740
and the explosion of supernovae.

68
00:04:26,740 --> 00:04:31,790
In the simulation you see behind me,
we used ten million particles

69
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:37,190
to model the evolution of a spiral galaxy
over several hundreds of millions of years.
