1
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:12,260
The Virial theorem is to random motion
what Kepler's laws are to planar motion.

2
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:18,250
It relates the kinetic energy
to the potential energy of « self-gravitating»

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:20,820
systems,
that is systems under the influence of their

4
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,680
own gravitational field
and isolated from any external gravitational

5
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,730
field.
Such systems include globular clusters

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:32,570
or more generally stellar clusters, such as
Omega Centauri, shown here.

7
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:40,260
Its mass, 1.5 million solar masses,
can be measured by applying the Virial theorem.

8
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,500
Lets demonstrate the Virial theorem in the
following

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:46,890
which says that the time average of twice
the kinetic energy

10
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,070
is equal to the time average of the potential
energy.

11
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:55,250
Let us consider
a quantity S equals to the sum over all particles

12
00:00:55,250 --> 00:01:06,460
k
of the momenta times the radius vectors.

13
00:01:06,460 --> 00:01:08,490
This is the projection of all the momenta
vectors

14
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:19,139
along the radius vectors of all particles.
As both the radius vectors and the velocities

15
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:26,200
are distributed randomly
around a centre of gravity common to all particles,

16
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:34,590
the time variation of S oscillates around
a mean value of zero.

17
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:40,749
Therefore the derivative also oscillates around
a mean value of zero.

18
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:54,099
The time average of dS/dt must then be zero.
Let us compute this derivative.

19
00:01:54,099 --> 00:01:59,259
We have the sum of two mean values.
One of them is the average of the potential

20
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:02,270
energy and
the other is twice the average of the kinetic

21
00:02:02,270 --> 00:02:06,729
energy
as we are going to show.

22
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:17,760
Let us rewrite the equation seen previously.
Here we have simply separated the two terms

23
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:24,840
of the equation.
We immediately recognize the velocity vector.

24
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:41,040
P can be expressed as a function of the velocity.
We have thus m v_k times v_k.

25
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,480
The vector v_k is obviously collinear with
v_k

26
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,409
and we recognize immediately
minus two times the average of the kinetic

27
00:02:48,409 --> 00:02:55,629
energy of the particles.
We now have to show that the other side of

28
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:59,920
the equation
is the time average of the potential energy.

29
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:09,840
This is what we are going to see now.
Let us rewrite this side.

30
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,680
We recognize here the force
which must be the gravitational force since

31
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:24,450
we have a central force.
The gravitational force.

32
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:30,129
If we can show
that this term is minus the potential energy

33
00:03:30,129 --> 00:03:44,609
then we will have proven the Virial theorem.
This is the same term as before.

34
00:03:44,609 --> 00:03:48,670
We know know that we have a gravitational
force

35
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:51,360
which is a force that can be derived from
a potential.

36
00:03:51,360 --> 00:04:00,420
We can therefore choose a potential.
Let us call it ϕ (r).

37
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:07,120
It is proportional to the radius raised to
a certain power.

38
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:17,220
For gravity, n = -2 so the potential depends
on -1/r

39
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:28,750
Let us rewrite the force in this way here.
What we have really written

40
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:36,220
is the derivative of the potential
with respect to the radius

41
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:42,280
with the potential that we chose here.
We can now rewrite the sum over k of all vectors

42
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:54,160
F_k r_k
We now have n+1 at the exponent since we multiplied

43
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,950
by the radius.
We can therefore immediately identify the

44
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:03,260
potential
since we have here the same term as in the

45
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:07,540
potential
and r^(n+1) here.

46
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:13,840
We can then rewrite this term as a function
of the potential.

47
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:21,790
We immediately recognise the potential energy.
For easier notation, we previously removed

48
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,290
the bracket
representing the time average.

49
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:27,760
We didn't make any calculation that would
make this average disappear

50
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:36,430
so we put the brackets back at the end here.
We have thus proven the Virial theorem.

51
00:05:36,430 --> 00:05:39,530
The Virial theorem is extremely useful in
astrophysics

52
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:43,740
because we have on one side
the mass of the bodies through their potential

53
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:47,520
energy (U)
and on the other side we can generally express

54
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,330
the kinetic energy in two different ways.
A first way is as a function of the body's

55
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:57,370
temperature.
If we consider for example a gas cloud at

56
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,130
a given temperature
then we have 1/2 n k T with k the Boltzmann

57
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:05,560
constant
and T the temperature per degree of freedom.

58
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:17,160
K is then equal to 1/2 k T per degree of freedom.
For example if we have three dimensions and

59
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:25,220
n particles,
then K = 3/2 n k T

60
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,590
with K the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature.
If we consider a gas cloud

61
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:34,610
at a given temperature T with n particles,
then we can express its kinetic energy in

62
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:40,490
this way.
We can also express it in the more usual way

63
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:52,020
of being the sum of the kinetic energies
of all particles, that is 1/2 m_k (v_k)².

64
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:58,580
For example, if we have a cloud of particles
and we know all the velocities or the velocity

65
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,830
distribution
then we can express the kinetic energy in

66
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:08,680
this way.
We just saw how to express the kinetic energy.

67
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,810
Now let us have a look at how to express the
potential energy.

68
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,020
To this end, we greatly simplify the body
of interest.

69
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:22,710
Lets take a spherical approximation.
This spherical body has a given density ϱ

70
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:26,170
which does not depend on the radius. In other
words, ϱ is constant.

71
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:31,440
We now stack spherical shells of density ϱ
from the infinity to a given radius r to form

72
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:42,500
a body with
a total mass (M) and a final radius (R)

73
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:48,000
once we stacked all the spherical shells.
The variation of the potential energy due

74
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:53,300
to the stacking of all the spherical shells
is equal to the work of the gravitational

75
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:58,890
force
to bring a shell from infinity to the radius

76
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,920
r.
We will first compute this work to bring the

77
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:09,730
shell from here to there
before integrating, that is summing over the

78
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:13,490
works
of the gravitational forces to bring all the

79
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:19,270
spherical shells
from infinity to r.

80
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:22,750
Let us have a first look on how to integrate
the gravitational force

81
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:28,760
from infinity to a given radius r.
The force is the gravitational force

82
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:35,080
between the mass m(r) and the spherical shell
with mass dm

83
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:43,990
located at a distance s from the sphere of
radius r.

84
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:47,940
We integrate this with respect to the bound
variable s.

85
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,550
The result of this integral is completely
obvious.

86
00:08:54,550 --> 00:09:03,970
This term evaluated between infinity and r
gives a variation of the potential energy.

87
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:07,050
We have thus computed the variation of the
potential energy

88
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:14,860
when the gravitational force works
to go from infinity to a radius r.

89
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:20,440
In order to get the total potential energy,
we have to sum over all the elementary potential

90
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,950
energies
that we computed previously from 0 to the

91
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:29,170
final radius R of the body
we are interested in getting the potential

92
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:36,960
energy.
This is the variation of the potential energy

93
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,560
that we just computed.
Let us rewrite it.

94
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,210
We can give an explicit form to this term
"dm"

95
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:54,170
by assuming as said earlier
that the mass density in the spherical shell

96
00:09:54,170 --> 00:10:06,400
and in the sphere here is constant.
We have G m(r) / r.

97
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:13,680
The term dm is the surface of the sphere times
its density and thickness.

98
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:19,060
We now have an integral that only depends
on r

99
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:24,240
and that we can thus compute.
We still have to make a last assumption.

100
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:28,370
Since we assumed
the density of the body we are interested

101
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,620
in
to be constant,

102
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:45,190
we can assume its mass to be 4/3 π R³ ϱ.
In the same way, the the m(r) here can be

103
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:55,540
expressed as 4/3 π r³ ϱ
We have here a lower case r for the small

104
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:58,640
sphere
and an upper case R as the final radius

105
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:04,120
of the star or body we are interested in.
If we use this to end the calculation

106
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:09,810
we get that
the potential energy of a sphere is -3/5 G

107
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:17,450
M²/R
where M is the total mass of the body and

108
00:11:17,450 --> 00:11:22,529
R the final radius.
Just like Kepler's laws,

109
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:25,830
the Virial theorem will appear many times
during the course.

110
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:29,990
It is essential in order to link the masses
of the studied bodies

111
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:36,330
to velocities or velocity distributions.
It is useful in the case of stellar clusters

112
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,550
where the velocities of the stars can be measured,
such as here with Omega Centauri cluster.

113
00:11:41,550 --> 00:11:47,290
It is also the case for stars in galaxies
or even for galaxies in galaxy clusters

114
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:51,510
such as the one here.
All these astronomical bodies can be weighed

115
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,860
in order to determine their mass
through the measurement of velocities or velocity

116
00:11:55,860 --> 00:11:58,149
distributions
by using the Virial theorem.
