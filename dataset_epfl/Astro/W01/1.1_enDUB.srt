00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,549
Welcome to this introductory course on astrophysics.
In this first video, we will become more familiar

2
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:16,960
with the astronomical objects in the Universe
and we will introduce the distance and mass

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,680
scales
needed to characterize them.

4
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:25,720
Let's first introduce the distance scales.
First of all, in the solar system, we often

5
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,700
use the astronomical unit
which is the distance between the Earth and

6
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:39,399
the Sun (1 AU - UA on the slides).
This distance is 149 millions km,

7
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:44,600
that is the distance between the Earth and
the Sun.

8
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:49,460
If we are interested in bigger distances,
we will often measure them in lightyears (ly

9
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:53,590
- al on the slides)
which is the distance travelled by light during

10
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:58,749
one year,
at the speed of 300.000 km/s.

11
00:00:58,749 --> 00:01:00,559
This corresponds to a distance of 9,46 times
10^12 km.

12
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,600
Most of the time, we will use another distance,
called the parsec

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:12,780
Most of the time, we will use another distance,
called the parsec

14
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,710
that we will define in the following.
It turns out that this distance, numerically

15
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:20,360
speaking,
is equals to 3,26 lightyears.

16
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:28,520
To define the parsec, we first have to define
what is called the parallax.

17
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,380
Parallax is the angle subtended by Earth's
radius at a distance d,

18
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:41,400
for example at the distance of this star.
Here is the line of sight to the star seen

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,380
from the Earth at a certain time.
The star will be at a particular apparent

20
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:53,110
location on the sky.
Six months later for example, the parallax

21
00:01:53,110 --> 00:01:57,240
of this star will be different:
the star will be observed at another location

22
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,310
on the sky.
The angle variation between the two positions

23
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,670
is called the parallax.
So, the parallax is an angle theta which depends

24
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:12,920
on Earth's orbital radius and on the distance
to the star.

25
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:19,330
During the year, what we will see on the sky
is the star following small ellipses

26
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:29,510
whose opening angle is equal to this parallax.
The parallax is simply theta = r/d

27
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,100
We can now express things in astronomical
units.

28
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:43,030
If r is equal to one astronomical unit
and if theta equals one arcsecond, then we

29
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:51,770
can write a very simple equation :
1 = 1/d. This obviously implies

30
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:58,110
that d is also equal to 1. This 1 has the
unit of a parsec,

31
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:02,470
which is the abbreviation of the parallax
of one arcsecond

32
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:08,270
In other words, if we express distances in
astronomical units

33
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:14,870
and parallaxes in arcseconds
then we can rewrite that the angle theta in

34
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:26,470
arcseconds
is equal to 1 over the distance in parsec.

35
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:32,690
That is, a parsec is the distance at which
one astronomical unit

36
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:39,160
subtends an angle of one arcsecond.
Those are the main units of distances in astrophysics.

37
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,180
Astronomical units are used for distances
of the order of the size of a planetary system

38
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:48,880
like our solar system. Otherwise, we use lightyears
or parsecs.

39
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:54,680
We have a direct relation between distances
in parsec and angles

40
00:03:54,680 --> 00:04:01,090
subtended by objects in the sky.
Now let's define some units of mass.

41
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,590
For example in the solar system, you have
here the planet Saturn

42
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:12,520
observed at different times.
In our solar system, we have eight planets

43
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:16,979
we can express their masses either in Earth
masses

44
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:20,100
for telluric planets, that is with a solid
crust,

45
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:26,760
or in Jupiter masses for gaseous planets.
The symbol used for Earth is a circle with

46
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:34,910
a cross in its centre.
The Earth's mass is equals to 5,97 times 10^24

47
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:43,080
kg.
Earth's radius is 6371 km. We will often express

48
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:52,960
planetary masses
and planetary radii in units of Earth masses

49
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,460
and Earth radii.
If we are interested in bigger planets, we

50
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,710
can compare
for example Jupiter mass, which is 317.8 times

51
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:11,449
the Earth mass,
and the radius of which equals 11 times Earth

52
00:05:11,449 --> 00:05:19,340
radius
In addition to the eight planets of the solar

53
00:05:19,340 --> 00:05:28,210
system, we currently know
1700 exoplanets or extra-solar planets.

54
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:32,970
The first extra-solar planet was discovered
in 1995 by Michel Mayor

55
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:41,320
and Didier Queloz at the Observatory of Geneva.
This one was an indirect detection,measured

56
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:46,260
thanks to the radial velocity of the star
around which it orbits.

57
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:54,710
The first direct detection was made in 2008.
In the solar system, we don't only find planets.

58
00:05:54,710 --> 00:06:00,790
There are also comets for example
which are sort of frozen mudballs

59
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:05,000
that evaporate as they get close to the Sun.
The matter ejected by the comet,

60
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:11,510
by its nucleus, is pushed by solar photons
along large cometary tails.

61
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:19,949
So, comets have a nucleus.
The nucleus is often very small, with a diameter

62
00:06:19,949 --> 00:06:30,930
of the order of 5 to 10 km, with a maximum
around 100 km.

63
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,200
They also have a halo. Its diameter is of
the order of 50'000 km

64
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:48,990
to 250 000 km.
Cometary dust is ejected to form tails.

65
00:06:48,990 --> 00:06:58,610
For example, we see here a dust tail, made
of quite heavy particles

66
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:04,300
and here a tail made of ionised matter, namely
ions.

67
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,039
Light particles are over there, and heavier
dusts

68
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,520
are generally ejected on another tail.
What is the composition of a comet?

69
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:18,389
They are mainly composed
of organic matter, C, H, O N and actually

70
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:28,710
contain 80% of water.
and around 10% of carbon monoxide.

71
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:40,289
Such cometary tails can reach a size of
the order of 60 to 100 millions km.

72
00:07:40,289 --> 00:07:45,330
We have then sizes of the order of the astronomical
unit.

73
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:50,860
Let's resume our tour of the solar system.
The solar system contains of course the Sun,

74
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,509
our reference star.
Note that it is the only star we know that

75
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:58,530
we can directly
observe the surface, that we can take pictures

76
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:03,290
of.
All other stars are way too small and too

77
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:06,610
far
for us to directly study their surface.

78
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:14,430
The surface temperature of the Sun is 5'700
K

79
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:17,830
This is the mass of the Sun, that will be
used as a reference

80
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:23,569
for the mass of other astronomical bodies.
We will generally express the masses of galaxies

81
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:27,240
and large astrophysical objects in terms of
solar masses.

82
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:35,880
This solar mass is 10³³ grams.
Here is the solar radius, that will also be

83
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:43,050
used to characterise
the radii of other stars for example.

84
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:54,200
Its value is 695'000 km, which is roughly
109 times Earth's radius

85
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:58,110
Other stars are similar to the Sun.
They are powered by

86
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:02,300
two phenomenon : gravitational compression,
and nuclear fusion

87
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:12,620
of hydrogen atoms into helium.
We usually define the lifetime of a star

88
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,890
as the time it takes to burn all its hydrogen
into helium.

89
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:20,570
This amount of time is the main part of a
star's lifespan.

90
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:26,720
The other extremely important parameter for
stars is their masses.

91
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:32,770
Star masses can range from
0.06 times the mass of the Sun up to 60 solar

92
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:39,279
masses.
Under 0.06 solar masses,

93
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:44,230
nuclear fusion reactions cannot ignite.
Beyond very large masses such as 60 to 100

94
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:50,830
solar masses,
the star will collapse and thus disappear.

95
00:09:50,830 --> 00:09:54,260
Stars radii, that we will compare to Sun's
radius

96
00:09:54,260 --> 00:10:00,560
will range typically from 0.17 (0.2) solar
radii

97
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:06,810
up to approximately 15 times solar radii.
This is the whole range of radii we can observe

98
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:12,911
on stars.
As for temperatures, the Sun

99
00:10:12,911 --> 00:10:21,089
has a surface temperature of 5'780 K.
The coldest stars can have temperatures of

100
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:31,970
the order of 2'640 K
and the hottest ones around 44'500 K.

101
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:36,950
The lifetime is, as mentionned before, the
time needed to burn

102
00:10:36,950 --> 00:10:44,521
hydrogen into helium.
This time varies on a very wide range, that

103
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:49,740
can go from
5 times 10^6, a few million years,

104
00:10:49,740 --> 00:11:01,790
up to 10^13 years.
A star can then last longer

105
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:10,260
than the current age of the universe, 13,7
billion years.

106
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,640
Stars luminosity will again be compared to
the Sun's.

107
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:22,959
Typically, the luminosity can vary
between 1,2 times 10^-3 solar luminosity,

108
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,500
1000 times less luminous than the Sun, and
up to stars as bright

109
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:36,330
as 8 times 10^5 solar luminosity.
Most stars are in mass, radius, temperature,

110
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:45,589
lifetime
and luminosity ranges that are written here.

111
00:11:45,589 --> 00:11:51,950
Stars do not have an infinite lifespan.
Once they burn all their hydrogen into helium,

112
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,110
there are two possible scenarios for the death
of a star.

113
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,120
Either the initial mass of the star is bigger
than 8 times the Sun's mass,

114
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:08,370
and we have a supernova, a very powerful explosion
of the star,

115
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:13,450
or the mass is lower than 8 times the mass
of the Sun,

116
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:20,860
and we have what is called a planetary nebula.
Unlike what the name suggests, a planetary

117
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:23,720
nebula
as nothing to do with planets. Here is one

118
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:27,090
of them,
nebula Messier 57 in the constellation of

119
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:30,810
Lyra.
Planetary nebulae are due to the expansion

120
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:33,110
of
the outer layers of the star and the collapse

121
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:37,740
of internal layers.
At the end of the process subsists at the

122
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,410
center
what is called a white dwarf, surrounded by

123
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:47,149
the star remnants.
It is the white dwarf that will ionize the

124
00:12:47,149 --> 00:12:51,420
gas all around the nebula.
In the external layers here, we recognize

125
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:57,450
radiating hydrogen
with red spectral lines.

126
00:12:57,450 --> 00:13:03,490
And in this part in green is the radiation
of oxygen.

127
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:10,270
Here is the expansion velocity of the nebula,
which grows as the gas expands all around

128
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,200
it.
The expansion speed is of the order of 20

129
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:19,589
to 30 km/s.
In a supernova, the speed of the external

130
00:13:19,589 --> 00:13:22,890
layers
much later after the explosion is of the order

131
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:28,660
of 2000 - 3000 km/s.
The matter ejected by stars at their death,

132
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,709
either
by a supernova or in the form of a planetary

133
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:37,330
nebula,
will be recycled into new stars.

134
00:13:37,330 --> 00:13:40,839
Here is the example of Great Orion Nebula
(Messier 42)

135
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:46,260
which has in its centre a cluster of young
stars forming

136
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:53,650
from the gas of the nebula.
There are a lot of things in such picture.

137
00:13:53,650 --> 00:14:03,670
There is ionized gas, the density of which
is around 1 particle /cm³,

138
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:13,970
that is a mass density of 10^-21 kg/m³.
Here the gas looks quite dense, but we actually

139
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:18,540
see the nebula from far away.
and the density is in reality lower than in

140
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:21,510
the ultra high vacuum
we can produce on Earth.

141
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:26,070
This concerns the gas that will emit a spectral
line radiation

142
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:29,860
at different wavelengths, which is generally
produced

143
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,350
by a hot source, such as a cluster of young
stars,

144
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:35,650
namely stars forming from the matter ejected
by

145
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:39,860
the death of other stars. We will also find
cosmic dust.

146
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:42,040
Dust absorbs background light, which is why
we see

147
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:48,889
all these dark stripes
here or there. These are areas filled with

148
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:52,790
dust.
This dust is composed of grains bigger than

149
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:57,079
the gas,
itself composed of atoms. Dust grains are

150
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:59,769
actually
similar to the dust left by a chalk on a blackboard

151
00:14:59,769 --> 00:15:02,630
for example.
This dust has a density even smaller

152
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:12,560
than the gas, for example 10^-13 particles
/cm³,

153
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,920
which is 13 orders of magnitude smaller than
the gas density.

154
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:28,480
The mass density is 10^-23 kg/m³.
We can of course imagine a situation

155
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,149
where all the gas has been recycled into stars.
It is usually the case in what we call open

156
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:41,240
clusters.
For example we see here in NGC 4755 a variety

157
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:46,240
of young stars, here and there.
All the blue stars in this cluster are at

158
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,779
the same distance from us.
The stars in the cluster have approximately

159
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:56,490
the same age.
The stars in this open cluster are very young,

160
00:15:56,490 --> 00:16:02,519
with an age
around 10^8 years,

161
00:16:02,519 --> 00:16:13,920
which is small in comparison to the age of
the universe, around 13.7 billion years.

162
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:23,260
The size of such a cluster is around 10 parsec.
It is also the size of the nebulae who give

163
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:30,940
birth to such clusters.
In a galaxy like our Milky Way,

164
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:34,690
we find young stellar clusters, open clusters
or non-open clusters

165
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:38,310
as well as globular clusters, such as this
one here.

166
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:42,649
A globular cluster is much more massive
than an open cluster.

167
00:16:42,649 --> 00:16:47,240
The typical mass of an open cluster ranges
from a few hundreds

168
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:52,839
to a few thousands solar masses.
The mass of a globular cluster is of the order

169
00:16:52,839 --> 00:16:55,230
of 10^6 solar masses.
The mass of a globular cluster is of the order

170
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:59,100
of 10^6 solar masses.
Globular clusters are relatively old star

171
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:02,630
clusters.
The age of the stars is of the order of 10^9

172
00:17:02,630 --> 00:17:10,589
up to 10^10 years.
Such clusters can be found in the periphery

173
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:14,229
of galaxies.
They are bigger than open clusters, with typical

174
00:17:14,229 --> 00:17:25,959
diameters of 40 to 50 parsecs.
Stars, planets, nebulae, star clusters are

175
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:31,109
all
elements of galaxies

176
00:17:31,109 --> 00:17:33,889
A galaxy is a much bigger object than everything
we've seen

177
00:17:33,889 --> 00:17:41,480
so far. Here you have a spiral galaxy
like our Milky Way, which is named after its

178
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:44,710
spiral structure
that you see in a disk with a bulge in its

179
00:17:44,710 --> 00:17:54,029
centre.
So here is the bulge, and here is the disk.

180
00:17:54,029 --> 00:17:56,299
Old stars are in the centre, while young stars
are

181
00:17:56,299 --> 00:18:01,360
usually formed in the arms.
What we don't see in this picture is a halo

182
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:07,799
of dark matter all around, in which are also
the globular clusters.

183
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,499
At the scale of this picture, the previously
seen globular

184
00:18:10,499 --> 00:18:16,850
cluster is completely invisible.
If it was visible, it would appear as a tiny

185
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:21,539
dot, just like these.
As for the diameter of a galaxy, you remember

186
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:26,080
stellar clusters
have sizes of 10, 40, 50 parsecs.

187
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:34,409
have sizes of 10, 40, 50 parsecs.
Here we have galactic disks

188
00:18:34,409 --> 00:18:41,499
with a diameter of 30 to 40 kiloparsecs.
The mass of a spiral galaxy is of the order

189
00:18:41,499 --> 00:18:52,499
of
10^9 up to 10^12 solar masses.

190
00:18:52,499 --> 00:18:58,139
Here is another example of a spiral galaxy.
As mentionned before, in a spiral galaxy you

191
00:18:58,139 --> 00:19:02,419
have a bulge, here,
and a disk that you see now here edge-on.

192
00:19:02,419 --> 00:19:08,859
This is the spiral galaxy NGC 891 seen edge-on.
What you see here

193
00:19:08,859 --> 00:19:13,429
is a halo around the bulge, composed of old
stars.

194
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:18,629
Here are the spiral arms seen from the side,
composed of young stars

195
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:22,950
and of dust absorbing the background light,
just like we saw earlier on with the nebula

196
00:19:22,950 --> 00:19:26,649
Messier 42,
the Great Orion Nebula, that was showed

197
00:19:26,649 --> 00:19:30,479
as an example of diffuse nebula.
In the disk you have

198
00:19:30,479 --> 00:19:39,090
dust and young stars.
The Milky Way looks like that. Obviously we

199
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,720
can't
see our own galaxy from outside, but if we

200
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:44,200
could
see the Milky Way from outside,

201
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,399
we would place the Sun here, at 2/3 of the
distance between

202
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:53,539
the centre and the exterior of the galaxy.
Again, the whole system is surrounded by a

203
00:19:53,539 --> 00:19:56,919
halo of
dark matter, that by definition does not emit

204
00:19:56,919 --> 00:20:03,779
any light.
Spiral galaxies are one kind of galaxy.

205
00:20:03,779 --> 00:20:07,999
There are also elliptical galaxies, which
as their name suggest

206
00:20:07,999 --> 00:20:11,970
have an elliptical shape. They are often at
the centre of galaxy clusters.

207
00:20:11,970 --> 00:20:15,279
This is why you see here other galaxies around
it.

208
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:17,749
All these galaxies are at the same distance
from us

209
00:20:17,749 --> 00:20:21,849
and the central galaxy is an elliptical one,
which is actually

210
00:20:21,849 --> 00:20:29,909
a sort of ball of old stars with random orbits
around a centre of gravity.

211
00:20:29,909 --> 00:20:36,629
Contrarly to spiral galaxies, they contain
little or no dust.

212
00:20:36,629 --> 00:20:45,119
They also contain little or no gas and form
only a few stars.

213
00:20:45,119 --> 00:20:50,759
Their masses covers a much wider range
than spiral galaxies, between

214
00:20:50,759 --> 00:21:03,170
10^7 and 10^13 solar masses.
They are generally encountered at the centre

215
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:10,359
of clusters of galaxies.
This is a cluster of galaxies.

216
00:21:10,359 --> 00:21:13,099
At the centre of a galaxy cluster, we usually
find

217
00:21:13,099 --> 00:21:20,450
a main elliptical galaxy, as we can see here.
We actually see a lot of elliptical galaxies,

218
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,070
even quite far from the centre.
There are also spiral galaxies, and virtually

219
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:31,970
all types of galaxies.
They all orbit around a common centre of gravity.

220
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:34,159
Galaxy clusters are the heaviest gravitationally
bound

221
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,690
structures in the universe.
They obviously contain visible matter, but

222
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:43,730
are also surrounded by
a halo of dark matter, just like individual

223
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:49,220
galaxies,
spiral galaxies, elliptical galaxies.

224
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:59,710
The masses involved are really huge,
between 10^14 to 10^15 solar masses.

225
00:21:59,710 --> 00:22:02,159
All the astronomical objects that we just
saw,

226
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,710
from the smallest to the largest, the lightest
to the heaviest,

227
00:22:06,710 --> 00:22:11,769
are part of a whole, the universe, the study
of which is called cosmology.

228
00:22:11,769 --> 00:22:15,229
In the picture behind me is an overview of
the whole universe

229
00:22:15,229 --> 00:22:20,379
in a single picture. This is the Hubble Ultra
Deep Field.

230
00:22:20,379 --> 00:22:25,739
a picture taken by the Hubble space telescope
that simultaneously shows in a single shot

231
00:22:25,739 --> 00:22:31,149
10'000 galaxies, illustrating
the diversity of the worlds surrounding us.

232
00:22:31,149 --> 00:22:35,659
It is by studying such pictures in details,
at different wavelengths,

233
00:22:35,659 --> 00:22:38,729
different resolutions and perhaps at different
eras

234
00:22:38,729 --> 00:22:42,130
that we can trace down the history of the
galaxies formation,

235
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:48,830
stars, planets, ..., in short, the whole universe.
Two essential tools to study the trajectories

236
00:22:48,830 --> 00:22:53,229
of astrophysical objects
and measure their masses are the three Kepler's

237
00:22:53,229 --> 00:22:58,110
laws
and the Virial theorem.

238
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,919
These will be the topic of the next videos.
