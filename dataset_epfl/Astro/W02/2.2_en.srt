00:00:04,157 --> 00:00:06,296
In this lecture, we will 
see more details

2
00:00:06,653 --> 00:00:08,480
about black-body radiation

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,792
and the spectral lines 
produced for example

4
00:00:10,792 --> 00:00:13,192
by an atomic or molecular gas.

5
00:00:13,192 --> 00:00:16,498
The black body, first of all, 
caracterises heated bodies

6
00:00:16,498 --> 00:00:19,631
that re emit radiation
at all wavelengths.

7
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:22,781
For instance, that is the case of a light 
bulb filament that converts 

8
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:25,267
electric energy into
light.

9
00:00:25,267 --> 00:00:29,274
That is the case of glowing embers
which, due to the heating by the flames,

10
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:31,512
will radiate at all wavelengths. 

11
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:36,316
It is also the case of lava 
ejected by volcanoes. 

12
00:00:36,676 --> 00:00:40,190
This blackbody radiation 
is characterised by

13
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:42,870
what we call the Planckian curve

14
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:48,091
which gives the energy distribution
as a function of wavelength

15
00:00:48,091 --> 00:00:51,525
or as a function of frequency. 

16
00:00:51,525 --> 00:00:56,360
The units of this luminance
(or specific intensity) is a power

17
00:00:56,360 --> 00:01:00,647
 by surface unit, by steradian,

18
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:02,643
for radiation that is 
emitted in all directions

19
00:01:02,643 --> 00:01:07,936
and optionally by wavelength unit 
as shown here on that axis,

20
00:01:07,936 --> 00:01:10,588
or by frequency unit.

21
00:01:11,598 --> 00:01:15,069
These Planckian curves 
have a bell shape

22
00:01:15,069 --> 00:01:19,160
with an increasing and decreasing slope
and so also a maximum.

23
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:23,238
The position of this maximum 
can be calculated

24
00:01:23,238 --> 00:01:27,730
by deriving the function
which gives the luminance.

25
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:30,190
If we do it here, as a function
of wavelength

26
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,923
we will find that the maximum
of the curve will occur

27
00:01:33,923 --> 00:01:37,295
at a position that depends
only upon the temperature.

28
00:01:37,295 --> 00:01:41,933
We have therefore a linear relation 
between the position of the maximum

29
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:46,102
of the black body curve and 
the black body temperature.

30
00:01:46,102 --> 00:01:49,753
So here we have 
a constant in m.K.

31
00:01:49,753 --> 00:01:53,847
We can have it in Å.K, which is more
useful with the units we use

32
00:01:53,847 --> 00:01:55,366
in astrophysics,  in 
the wavelength range

33
00:01:55,366 --> 00:01:57,037
used in astrophysics.

34
00:01:57,037 --> 00:02:02,560
We can see here the position of the maximun 
of the black body curve

35
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,373
for a black body temperature 
of 6000K.

36
00:02:07,843 --> 00:02:15,837
Or here for a 
temperature of 5780K.

37
00:02:15,837 --> 00:02:18,960
That is the surface temperature 
of the sun for example. 

38
00:02:21,521 --> 00:02:29,323
and these curves show different 
temperatures, here 5500K,

39
00:02:29,323 --> 00:02:36,033
5000K and 4500K.

40
00:02:37,951 --> 00:02:40,620
Stars are excellent black bodies.

41
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:47,231
So we can immediately see that λmax 
decreases when T increases.

42
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:48,992
We can indeed observe it here.

43
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:52,174
A high temperature yields 
a peak emission 

44
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:54,401
in the short wavelengths, 
the bluer ones. 

45
00:02:54,401 --> 00:02:58,190
And lower temperatures result
in emission peaks

46
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:01,640
that lie at higher wavelengths,
the redder ones.

47
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,093
Since we have red on this side of the 
spectrum and blue on that side,

48
00:03:07,093 --> 00:03:09,025
in the optical wavelengths range

49
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:15,471
A hot star will appear blue

50
00:03:15,471 --> 00:03:20,584
while a cold stellar object will
appear red.

51
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,930
So of course this Wien's displacement law 
which gives the position of the maximum

52
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,832
of the black body peak 
as a function of temperature

53
00:03:28,832 --> 00:03:32,619
can be expressed in wavelengths
or in frequencies.

54
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:35,945
depending on whether we express the luminance
as a funtion of wavelength 

55
00:03:35,945 --> 00:03:37,995
or frequency.

56
00:03:37,995 --> 00:03:42,080
And looking at the two equations
we tend to feel that

57
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:59,778
(λmax x T) x (νmax/T) 
should be equal to λmax x νmax

58
00:03:59,778 --> 00:04:03,989
of course, but also equal to c. 

59
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:05,836
Actually that is not the case.

60
00:04:05,836 --> 00:04:11,321
If we take the numerical values here,
we can see that we have 0.57 * c

61
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:18,996
and that comes from the fact that
Bν is not equal to Bλ,

62
00:04:19,197 --> 00:04:26,436
but is equal to Bλ * dλ/dν as we 
have shown in a previous lecture

63
00:04:26,436 --> 00:04:32,435
and so is equal to Bλ x λ²/c.

64
00:04:32,435 --> 00:04:35,622
Another feature which will
interest us,

65
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:40,676
is of course the total energy,
the energy flux density

66
00:04:40,676 --> 00:04:45,060
developed by a stellar object which
radiates black body radiation,

67
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,394
in other words the whole of 
the luminance at all wavelengths

68
00:04:49,394 --> 00:04:51,211
or at all frequencies.

69
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:54,720
So once the integration is done
the available energy

70
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,882
once we have integrated the black body
for example here, under the orange curve,

71
00:05:00,882 --> 00:05:10,712
the result of the integral is the
density of the energy flux which is simply

72
00:05:10,712 --> 00:05:13,685
proportional to the temperature 
to the fourth.

73
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:16,766
So we have here a proportionality constant
which is of course a power

74
00:05:16,766 --> 00:05:19,852
by surface unit and by 
Kelvin to the minus 4.

75
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:24,315
As soon as we have the black body 
temperature we can determine

76
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:28,805
the radiated power by surface unit at 
the surface of the black body.

77
00:05:28,805 --> 00:05:35,802
So M, is simply the power 
emitted by a unit surface

78
00:05:37,032 --> 00:05:39,796
at the surface of the black body.

79
00:05:42,435 --> 00:05:46,604
So now, what is the relation 
with stellar luminosity?

80
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:50,889
The luminosity, is here the total 
energy freed by the star,

81
00:05:51,181 --> 00:05:55,705
The luminosity will be given in erg/s.

82
00:05:55,705 --> 00:06:04,909
This luminosity, will be the surface of the
star multiplied by M.

83
00:06:04,909 --> 00:06:16,727
So 4π r² * σ T^4, where we 
have here the radius of the star.

84
00:06:16,727 --> 00:06:21,610
The flux M will be integrated
on the whole surface.

85
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:27,537
And M is the available power
by surface unit

86
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:31,581
at the surface of the black body
here of the star.

87
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:34,340
So now, we at the
level of the earth,

88
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:39,401
we receive only part
of that energy,

89
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:42,789
at a certain distance d.

90
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:45,880
If we are situated at a certain distance d,

91
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:52,867
we will recive a flux by
surface unit: the flux F here

92
00:06:52,867 --> 00:06:57,603
which will be L diluted on 
a sphere of radius 4πd².

93
00:06:57,603 --> 00:07:05,614
So the flux we are receiving, we 
on the ground, is L / 4πd²,

94
00:07:05,614 --> 00:07:09,200
that is receivend on earth.

95
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:18,779
For this, the unit of F will be 
erg by second by cm squared

96
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:22,692
because it is diluted on 
a sphere of radius d,

97
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,710
and also by Angstrom in case
we are interested in the spectroscopy

98
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,617
where we disperse the light
as a function of wavelength.

99
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:35,472
A lot of stellar objects emit 
black body radiation.

100
00:07:35,472 --> 00:07:39,341
Our Sun to begin with, 
whose surface emits

101
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:42,936
in the visible wavelength range the
energy produced at the center of the Sun

102
00:07:42,936 --> 00:07:44,836
by nuclear reactions.

103
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:49,061
The dust in the disks
of spiral galaxies

104
00:07:49,061 --> 00:07:52,761
is heated by young stars,
found in the spiral arms,

105
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:56,819
visible here on the right in 
the optical image of the galaxy.

106
00:07:56,819 --> 00:08:03,287
This energy emitted by the stars, is 
absorbed by interstellar dust

107
00:08:03,287 --> 00:08:05,524
and re emitted in the form of
black body radiation

108
00:08:05,524 --> 00:08:07,735
whose peak is situated
in the infra-red wavelength 

109
00:08:07,735 --> 00:08:10,912
as can be seen here on the
image to the right,

110
00:08:10,912 --> 00:08:13,591
of the same galaxy but taken in
the infra-red wavelengths.

111
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:17,777
One of the most beautiful black bodies
is probably the cosmological black body

112
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:21,482
whose spectrum is shown here
as a function of frequency.

113
00:08:21,482 --> 00:08:25,945
It is an isotropic micro-wave radiation 
which is present everywhere in the universe

114
00:08:25,945 --> 00:08:28,680
and whose origin lies in the Big Bang.

115
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:32,969
The universe which was extremely hot
extended itself and became colder,

116
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:37,270
emitting an ambiant radiation which
corresponds now,

117
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:40,426
13,7 billion years after the big bang

118
00:08:40,426 --> 00:08:46,749
to a black body whose temperature is
very close to the absolute zero : 2,73K.

119
00:08:47,563 --> 00:08:50,760
What you see here are the 
measurement points in black,

120
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,673
and the theoretical curve as a solid line. 

121
00:08:53,673 --> 00:08:57,720
You see that theory and measurements
perfectly agree.

122
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,062
Black body radiation is
certainly

123
00:09:00,062 --> 00:09:02,802
one of the most common types 
of radiation in astrophysics.

124
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:04,522
It produces a continuous spectrum.

125
00:09:04,522 --> 00:09:09,046
The other type of frequently encountered
spectrum is the line spectrum

126
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:11,502
which we will see in a moment.

127
00:09:11,502 --> 00:09:15,009
We had already talked about atomic
lines in a previous chapter.

128
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:21,713
We had taken the example of a
relatively hot star, here at 15000K.

129
00:09:21,713 --> 00:09:24,560
Now that we have learned about black bodies,
we see that a hot star

130
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,572
essentially radiates in the blue wavelengths.

131
00:09:26,572 --> 00:09:27,790
That is what happens here.

132
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:30,426
We have an extremely steep spectrum
in the blue

133
00:09:30,426 --> 00:09:34,866
and we have a continuous one, 
which is the black body spectrum

134
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:37,562
which is described by the
Planckian curve.

135
00:09:37,562 --> 00:09:42,459
Now, on top of that, we have 
a line spectrum,

136
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:43,950
with absorption lines in this case,

137
00:09:43,996 --> 00:09:49,751
which are due to hydrogen atoms
present in the atmosphere,

138
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:53,873
in the upper layers of
the stellar atmosphere.

139
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:58,369
Let's see in more details the line spectrum 
produced in this case here

140
00:09:58,369 --> 00:10:00,120
by the hydrogen atoms.

141
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,916
For that, let's go back to
Bohr's atomic model

142
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,619
where the electron is in 
orbit around the proton.

143
00:10:05,619 --> 00:10:10,723
We obviously have an equilibrium between
the Coulomb force.

144
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:19,860
We have a proton and then an 
electron in orbit around the proton,

145
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,594
namely, a hydrogen atom.

146
00:10:21,594 --> 00:10:26,433
This is the mass times acceleration.
This is just the Newtons law here.

147
00:10:26,433 --> 00:10:33,581
Quantum mechanics tells us 
that kinetic momentum is quantified

148
00:10:33,581 --> 00:10:37,892
and that the kinetic momentum takes 
an integer value multiplied by a constant.

149
00:10:37,892 --> 00:10:40,672
Here we have an integer value

150
00:10:40,672 --> 00:10:44,429
times a constant,
which is the h bar constant

151
00:10:44,969 --> 00:10:51,204
namely the Planck constant divided
by 2π, so h / 2π.

152
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:56,181
The two equations which we
have written in the previous slide

153
00:10:56,637 --> 00:11:00,655
are simply Newton's law and
the quantification of kinetic momentum,

154
00:11:00,655 --> 00:11:04,440
i.e. the fact that the kinetic momentum
of the electron around the proton

155
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,970
can take only very specific
values.

156
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,759
These two equations will permit us to
express the total energy of the electron.

157
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:18,247
So the kinetic energy here
and the potential energy here,

158
00:11:20,107 --> 00:11:22,904
as a function of n and the
Planck constant,

159
00:11:23,174 --> 00:11:24,989
so an integer value and
the Planck constant,

160
00:11:24,989 --> 00:11:29,088
rather then as a function of the radius
and the velocity of the electron.

161
00:11:29,088 --> 00:11:31,758
 So we have two equations with two unknowns,
the solution is trivial.

162
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:37,795
We come back to the total energy of 
the electron, which will be negative

163
00:11:37,795 --> 00:11:39,760
since the system is bound.

164
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,597
The total energy will depend upon 
a constant, is negative

165
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:48,992
and will depend on the energy level 
characterised by n,

166
00:11:48,992 --> 00:11:52,306
which we defined earlier and
which is responsible for

167
00:11:52,306 --> 00:11:55,166
the quantification of the kinetic momentum.

168
00:11:55,166 --> 00:12:00,913
The energy of the electron is quantified.
The total energy will depend

169
00:12:00,913 --> 00:12:02,756
on an integer value and a constant.

170
00:12:02,756 --> 00:12:04,764
We recognise here a
lot of physical constants:

171
00:12:04,764 --> 00:12:07,704
the Planck constant divided by 2π,

172
00:12:07,704 --> 00:12:12,507
the mass and charge of
the electron

173
00:12:12,507 --> 00:12:15,199
and  the electrostatic permittivity 
constant of vacuum ε0.

174
00:12:15,199 --> 00:12:20,037
If we express all that in numerical
terms we find that this constant is

175
00:12:20,037 --> 00:12:23,264
2.18 x 10^-18 Joules

176
00:12:24,882 --> 00:12:26,380
It is an energy.

177
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:29,292
If we convert the result into
a more useful energy unit

178
00:12:29,292 --> 00:12:31,482
for particle physics or 
astrophysics

179
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,630
or also for atomic physics, 
we find -13,6 eV.

180
00:12:36,737 --> 00:12:40,712
So for the record, an electron-volt is the
energy acquired by one electron

181
00:12:40,999 --> 00:12:46,098
at rest when it is accelerated by
a voltage difference of 1 Volt.


182
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,593
That is the definition of
an electron-volt.

183
00:12:51,233 --> 00:12:54,388
We saw that the total 
energy is quantified,

184
00:12:54,388 --> 00:12:59,030
so we have an energy that is a
function of the integer value n

185
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:04,382
and depends on the constant -13,6eV * (1/n²)

186
00:13:04,382 --> 00:13:09,986
where in fact n characterises the 
orbit on which moves

187
00:13:09,986 --> 00:13:12,199
an electron around the proton.

188
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:18,331
We have a proton here and then
we have an electron that might be

189
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:25,520
on an orbit n1 or on an orbit n2.

190
00:13:25,520 --> 00:13:29,097
The electron will be able to go 
from one orbit to another

191
00:13:29,097 --> 00:13:33,516
by gaining or losing energy.

192
00:13:33,516 --> 00:13:39,153
If for example a photon
is absorbed by an atom

193
00:13:39,153 --> 00:13:45,005
the electron will be able to go
from the n1 layer to the n2 layer

194
00:13:45,005 --> 00:13:46,273
by gaining energy.

195
00:13:46,273 --> 00:13:48,320
Conversely, we can also have electrons

196
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,315
that are in the n2 layer,
an "excited" layer,

197
00:13:51,315 --> 00:13:55,287
and then will go back to the n1 layer.

198
00:13:55,287 --> 00:13:59,873
The atom will lose energy,

199
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:04,610
by emitting a photon with a
certain energy hν.

200
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,966
What the frequency of this photon will be ?

201
00:14:06,966 --> 00:14:10,652
We can compute it by simply 
calculationg the energy difference 

202
00:14:10,652 --> 00:14:15,222
between the atomic layers
of the hydrogen atom.

203
00:14:15,222 --> 00:14:18,827
For example, the energy difference 
between layers 1 and 2

204
00:14:18,827 --> 00:14:22,277
can be expressed using the equation
we have seen before.

205
00:14:22,277 --> 00:14:27,090
-13,6 times the difference 
of the numerical constants here.

206
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:32,172
So (1/n1² -1/n2²) is of course
in electron-volts.

207
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,841
It is also the energy that the 
photons will have once emitted 

208
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:40,048
by the hydrogen atoms that 
will go down 

209
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:43,640
from the layer n2 to n1.

210
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,020
It is also the energy one has
to bring to an hydrogen atom to

211
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:52,838
raise an electron from layer n1 to 
layer n2.

212
00:14:54,181 --> 00:14:58,202
We can summarize here in a figure 
what happens in a hydrogen atom.

213
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:02,280
We said that we have multiple 
possible energy levels that correspond

214
00:15:02,280 --> 00:15:05,960
each time to an integer value,
from 1 to the limit, infinity.

215
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,785
We could not represent here 
all the energy levels

216
00:15:08,785 --> 00:15:11,339
between the layer 5 and infinity.

217
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,955
But if we could zoom in we would 
see more and more layers.

218
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:18,446
We can have all possible
transitions

219
00:15:18,446 --> 00:15:22,359
between a starting layer and
arrival layers.

220
00:15:22,359 --> 00:15:26,865
For example to go from 
the fundamental layer, here,

221
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:34,910
to higher energy layers, one needs 
energies that will be characterised

222
00:15:35,473 --> 00:15:38,540
by photons whose wavelengths
are written here.

223
00:15:38,830 --> 00:15:42,198
So, if we want energies, high energy differences,

224
00:15:42,198 --> 00:15:44,440
we need photons with
short wavelengths

225
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:50,239
so with high frequencies and 
therefore high energy differences.

226
00:15:50,239 --> 00:15:55,206
Here have the first series of lines 
called the Lyman series,

227
00:15:57,036 --> 00:15:59,390
which corresponds to
all possible transitions

228
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:03,528
between the fundamental layer
and all other atomic layers.

229
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:16,120
So if we supply an atom with an energy 
higher then 13.6eV, the atom will get ionized.

230
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,440
In other words, it will lose
its electron.

231
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:26,556
So an ionized gas is a gas transformed
into a mix of ions and electrons.

232
00:16:29,419 --> 00:16:31,441
So for the Lyman series,
we see that

233
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:34,321
the wavelengths are 
in the ultraviolet.

234
00:16:35,231 --> 00:16:41,648
If we play the same game starting from
layer 2 to all layers above it,

235
00:16:41,946 --> 00:16:45,921
we get the so-called 
Balmer series

236
00:16:45,921 --> 00:16:50,586
which, this time, is in the 
optical range.

237
00:16:51,609 --> 00:16:58,009
Finally, if we start a bit further still,
from the next energy level,

238
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:05,500
we will find the Paschen series,
which is in the infrared.

239
00:17:06,320 --> 00:17:10,060
Of course there are other series,
going further and further

240
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,212
in wavelength

241
00:17:11,443 --> 00:17:13,992
and to lower and 
lower energy differences.

242
00:17:15,141 --> 00:17:19,283
Now lets go back to the 
example of a star we had before

243
00:17:19,283 --> 00:17:24,588
the star with a black body
spectrum of  15000K

244
00:17:24,588 --> 00:17:29,761
and whose radiation peak is located 
in the blue part of the spectrum.

245
00:17:29,761 --> 00:17:34,689
So we can recognise here some lines
of the Balmer series.

246
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:40,464
The Balmer series is here and we can
see if we want to predict

247
00:17:40,464 --> 00:17:42,593
the wavelengths of the 
different transitions here

248
00:17:42,593 --> 00:17:49,875
that we have for example a line at 4861Å
which is actually the Hβ line.

249
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:53,407
So this is 4861Å.

250
00:17:54,517 --> 00:17:57,040
So if we look here we see exactly

251
00:17:57,173 --> 00:17:59,648
the wavelength predicted
by this formula.

252
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:05,280
If we look at the following line,
we have Hγ at 4341Å

253
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,912
which will be here.

254
00:18:13,152 --> 00:18:16,544
The Hα line lies outside of

255
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:18,780
the wavelength range of this spectrum,

256
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,238
so it is not visible.

257
00:18:20,238 --> 00:18:25,033
If we went further and further 
down the blue side of the spectrum,

258
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:27,280
we would have a whole
series of lines, here,

259
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:31,301
from layer 2 to all the layers 
that we couldn't represent

260
00:18:31,425 --> 00:18:33,603
and that would be in this box here.

261
00:18:34,882 --> 00:18:38,281
We haven't shown them here, 
since there would be an infinity of arrows here.

262
00:18:38,281 --> 00:18:42,182
That said, we can see them
in the spectrum of the star.

263
00:18:42,182 --> 00:18:46,105
This multitudes of lines has a
limit, here we have a limit

264
00:18:46,465 --> 00:18:48,992
that corresponds to the ionisation of the atom.

265
00:18:48,992 --> 00:18:54,030
So if an electron is on layer 2 and 
we provide it with a higher energy,

266
00:18:54,030 --> 00:19:01,778
than the energy so to -3,39 eV, the atom
will lose its electron and so be ionised.

267
00:19:01,778 --> 00:19:05,268
No lines will be formed since the 
atom doesn't exist any more

268
00:19:05,268 --> 00:19:06,323
as an atom.

269
00:19:06,323 --> 00:19:08,766
We have a proton/electron pair, 
so an ionised gas.

270
00:19:08,766 --> 00:19:12,097
Here are all line series
we can directly observe

271
00:19:12,097 --> 00:19:14,067
in the spectrum of the star.

272
00:19:15,757 --> 00:19:18,575
There exists a wide variety of 
astronomical objects

273
00:19:18,661 --> 00:19:20,358
characterized by a line spectrum.

274
00:19:20,358 --> 00:19:24,440
The line spectrum is often typical
of the interstellar medium where the atoms

275
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,712
excited by stellar radiation
produce a spectrum

276
00:19:27,712 --> 00:19:30,252
consisting almost exclusively in lines.

277
00:19:30,252 --> 00:19:33,800
The latter inform us about the
cheamical composition of the gas 

278
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,267
of which nebulae are made. 

279
00:19:35,267 --> 00:19:38,135
The same is true of
planetary nebulae

280
00:19:38,135 --> 00:19:41,731
where the differents gas layers
are excited by the radiation

281
00:19:41,731 --> 00:19:44,801
of the white dwarf star lying at 
the centre of the nebula.

282
00:19:44,801 --> 00:19:47,899
And, closer to us, the polar aurorae
we can see

283
00:19:47,899 --> 00:19:52,197
during strong solar activity display
also a line spectrum.

284
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:56,253
We can see one here 
from the International Space Station.

285
00:19:56,253 --> 00:20:00,832
In this case the atoms in the upper 
layers of the terrestial atmosphere

286
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:03,680
are excited by collisions
with the protons

287
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:06,014
and electrons from the Sun

288
00:20:06,014 --> 00:20:08,811
that are captured in the terrestrial
magnetic field.

289
00:20:08,811 --> 00:20:12,192
It is by losing energy through de-excitation 
that the atoms emit the polar auroras

290
00:20:12,192 --> 00:20:15,123
which have a magnificent line spectrum.
