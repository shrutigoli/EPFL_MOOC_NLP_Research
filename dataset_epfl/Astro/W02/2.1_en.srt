1
00:00:04,115 --> 00:00:07,590
The main source, or even
the only source of information

2
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:10,178
coming from space are the photons.

3
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:13,868
Their energy distribution, 
meaning their colour,

4
00:00:13,868 --> 00:00:16,467
and their quantity, which is
their spectral distribution

5
00:00:16,467 --> 00:00:20,721
shown here in the optical domain
from blue to red,

6
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:25,706
inform us on the physical
processes responsible for the emission

7
00:00:25,706 --> 00:00:27,972
and absorption of the radiation,
therefore of the photons,

8
00:00:27,972 --> 00:00:31,672
but also on the physical properties
of the environment, namely the matter

9
00:00:31,682 --> 00:00:34,632
with which the radiation will interact.

10
00:00:34,779 --> 00:00:37,568
As we have just mentioned,
light is extremly important

11
00:00:37,568 --> 00:00:41,353
in astrophysics, because light
carries energy as a wave

12
00:00:41,353 --> 00:00:42,855
or as a particle.

13
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:45,557
This is the wave-particle duality.

14
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:49,644
The photons
will convey a certain amount of energy

15
00:00:49,644 --> 00:00:51,440
which will be quantified.

16
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:56,968
This energy is proportional
to the frequency of the photon.

17
00:00:58,127 --> 00:01:01,713
And the proportionality constant,
which is the Planck constant,

18
00:01:01,713 --> 00:01:04,600
has the units of an angular momentum.

19
00:01:05,655 --> 00:01:08,727
So in quantum physics, it's the
angular momentum that is quantified

20
00:01:08,727 --> 00:01:11,119
and thus also the energy 
of the photons.

21
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:16,600
Obviously the frequency is related,
as always, to the wavelength

22
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:22,072
through the speed of light
and the period of oscillation of the wave

23
00:01:22,072 --> 00:01:25,513
which is 1 divided
by the frequency.

24
00:01:26,264 --> 00:01:30,406
The energy is measured per unit of time,
so it is actually a power. 


25
00:01:30,406 --> 00:01:35,788
If a star radiates a certain luminosity L,

26
00:01:36,088 --> 00:01:41,311
the brightness will be measured 
for example in ergs per second,

27
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:45,520
an energy unit divided by a time unit,

28
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:54,816
and that brightness, which we will have here,
will be captured

29
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:58,428
at a certain distance 
from the Earth,

30
00:01:59,679 --> 00:02:02,530
here, at a distance d.

31
00:02:02,715 --> 00:02:06,458
And we will capture it 
on a certain surface,

32
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:11,080
so we have here the isotropic radiation of a star
with total luminosity L.

33
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,005
This radiation will be diluted
on a sphere of surface

34
00:02:15,005 --> 00:02:17,798
4 π times the distance squared.

35
00:02:17,798 --> 00:02:20,820
In the end, what we will
receive on the ground,

36
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,068
is a certain flux of photons, 
a certain flux of energy,

37
00:02:25,068 --> 00:02:31,968
which will be the original luminosity L
of the star divided by 4 π d²

38
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:33,936
That is what we find here.

39
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:37,740
We have the luminosity, namely the energy,
actually the power 

40
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,600
- energy divided by time - that will be distributed
 isotropically,

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,750
on the surface of the sphere which is here,
and we only receive

42
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,520
a small part of the whole radiation.

43
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,952
We will also observe
at certain specific wavelengths

44
00:02:49,988 --> 00:02:52,785
or frequencies.

45
00:02:52,785 --> 00:02:56,599
So to go from the expression
of a flux in wavelength units

46
00:02:56,599 --> 00:02:58,993
to a flux in frequency units,

47
00:02:58,993 --> 00:03:02,845
it isn't enough to replace 
λ by ν. 

48
00:03:02,845 --> 00:03:07,999
Regardless of the way 
one measures the available energy

49
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:13,192
in wavelength units or in 
frequency units

50
00:03:13,366 --> 00:03:15,170
one has to have the same result.

51
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,810
If I multiply the flux 
by a wavelength unit

52
00:03:17,810 --> 00:03:24,040
or the flux expressed in frequency units
by a certain interval of frequencies

53
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,292
I need to obtain the same result, 
in absolute values,

54
00:03:26,358 --> 00:03:29,901
since λ and ν vary inversely.

55
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:35,286
Now, we said that λ = c / ν.

56
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:45,540
This implies that if I take the 
differential we have dλ = - (c /ν²) x dν.

57
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:57,543
If we replace dλ here, we obtain
immediately that fν = (c / ν² )x fλ.

58
00:03:57,543 --> 00:04:01,730
So the relation between the flux expressed 
in frequency units

59
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,384
and the flux expressed
in wavelength units

60
00:04:04,384 --> 00:04:05,987
is not totally obvious.

61
00:04:05,987 --> 00:04:08,390
There is a slight distortion
between the two scales.

62
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:13,986
Photons do not only carry energy:
 note that energy

63
00:04:13,986 --> 00:04:16,562
can be expressed in different ways
for the photons.

64
00:04:16,562 --> 00:04:20,890
It can be written
as E = hν,

65
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:25,713
but can also be written as 
the quadratic sum of p x c + mc²

66
00:04:25,713 --> 00:04:28,044
with the famous mass energy.

67
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:30,864
Now for photons,
there is no mass energy

68
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:33,335
but they still have 
a momentum.

69
00:04:33,335 --> 00:04:38,598
Therefore we can write that E = p times c
where p is the momentum.

70
00:04:38,913 --> 00:04:49,392
Of course, one can reverse the equation and get
p = E/c = hν (for the photons) /c

71
00:04:49,392 --> 00:04:51,890
Now what will happen, is that 
each time one has for example,

72
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:55,790
a particle of matter or a dust particle,

73
00:04:55,790 --> 00:04:59,226
a photon can be absorbed

74
00:04:59,226 --> 00:05:02,605
During the absorption, 
all the momentum of the photon, 

75
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,434
- because a photon is always 
entirely absorbed or emitted -

76
00:05:06,434 --> 00:05:09,443
all the momentum of the
photon will be transfered here

77
00:05:09,443 --> 00:05:12,234
to the particle or dust-particle.

78
00:05:12,234 --> 00:05:22,483
So, during the transfer, the dp/dt
of the particle is just hν/c.

79
00:05:22,934 --> 00:05:27,523
the whole momentum of the photon will be transferred to the particle,

80
00:05:27,523 --> 00:05:36,925
The dp/dt of the particle is a force, 
whose norm is hν / c.

81
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:39,763
This force is extremely 
important in astrophysics.

82
00:05:39,763 --> 00:05:44,184
It will play a role in the wole
process of star formation

83
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:48,441
through atomic or molecular 
cloud collapse.

84
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:53,520
This force is called
<i>radiation pressure</i>

85
00:05:54,294 --> 00:06:00,001
This force will be generated 
by a photon flux hitting particles,

86
00:06:00,001 --> 00:06:02,911
atoms, molecules, dust particles.

87
00:06:02,911 --> 00:06:07,055
We have seen that light
can transport energy.

88
00:06:07,074 --> 00:06:09,276
It can also transport
momentum,

89
00:06:09,276 --> 00:06:11,981
and transfer this momentum to matter,

90
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:13,862
therefore imprinting force on matter

91
00:06:13,862 --> 00:06:18,957
Now how does the photon spectrum
distribute itself in energy?

92
00:06:18,957 --> 00:06:24,279
The spectrum, this energy distribution,
can be discrete or continuous.

93
00:06:24,279 --> 00:06:28,476
In one case, we have a radiation
where all wavelengths

94
00:06:28,476 --> 00:06:30,560
are present in the spectrum.

95
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:34,040
In the other case, only some 
wavelengths are present,

96
00:06:34,053 --> 00:06:35,839
so discrete lines will form the spectrum.

97
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:39,371
In most cases, astronomical objects 
will show spectra

98
00:06:39,371 --> 00:06:41,441
that are a combination of
both types of radiation.

99
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:46,992
The physical processes at play
behind these types of emission

100
00:06:46,992 --> 00:06:50,132
are not the same, and this is why we can 
study celestial bodies.

101
00:06:50,842 --> 00:06:54,525
First of all, continuous radiation:
we have here a continuous spectrum.

102
00:06:54,992 --> 00:06:59,700
Each photon which has been emitted
from blue to red,

103
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,365
so here we show only the 
visible wavelength range,

104
00:07:02,365 --> 00:07:08,591
each photon transports an energy hν,
which we can also write

105
00:07:08,591 --> 00:07:11,534
as a momentum,

106
00:07:11,709 --> 00:07:15,777
and a wavelength which is equal to c/ν

107
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:18,930
so the wavelength and the frequency
vary in opposite ways.

108
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,619
Here we recognise of course the blue,
with the red on this side of the spectrum

109
00:07:25,589 --> 00:07:31,885
the short wavelengths, so, small λ, 
are on this side of the spectrum

110
00:07:32,592 --> 00:07:34,967
large λ.

111
00:07:34,967 --> 00:07:37,480
It is the opposite for the frequencies.

112
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:41,219
Finally the most powerful 
phenomena...

113
00:07:41,748 --> 00:07:46,683
So, more energy is transported 
at short wavelengths

114
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:48,590
or at  high frequencies. 

115
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,914
And here, less energy because 
the wavelengths are larger

116
00:07:54,914 --> 00:07:57,710
and the frequencies shorter.

117
00:07:58,312 --> 00:08:01,200
The energy distribution of the photons
can be continuous

118
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:03,556
or discrete.

119
00:08:03,612 --> 00:08:06,944
This is the case in atomic 
or molecular clouds

120
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:11,507
where each photon has 
a well-defined energy.

121
00:08:11,507 --> 00:08:16,520
For example here, we have a given 
photon with an energy E1 = hν1.

122
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:22,206
Here we have another photon
with an energy E2 = hν2.

123
00:08:22,206 --> 00:08:25,768
This type of radiation is generally 
present in nebulae,

124
00:08:25,768 --> 00:08:30,212
atomic or molecular clouds,
excited by ionisation sources,

125
00:08:30,212 --> 00:08:33,149
in other words, heating of matter.

126
00:08:33,234 --> 00:08:35,902
For example, stars in a nebula.

127
00:08:37,438 --> 00:08:40,777
Of course, most of the time
we will have

128
00:08:40,777 --> 00:08:42,788
a combination of both 
types of radiation.

129
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:46,844
For example here, we have a continuous
radiation which will superimpose itself

130
00:08:46,844 --> 00:08:49,225
with a discrete radiation.

131
00:08:49,225 --> 00:08:53,354
This happens when a 
background source is seen

132
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:55,797
through, for example
a cold gaz cloud.

133
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:59,685
We will see that later on, where
some wavelengths are absorbed.

134
00:08:59,685 --> 00:09:04,397
So here, again we have:
E1 = hν1

135
00:09:06,037 --> 00:09:08,600
E2 = hν2

136
00:09:08,917 --> 00:09:12,279
where ν1 and ν2 are exactly
the same frequencies

137
00:09:12,448 --> 00:09:13,812
as in the previous slides.

138
00:09:13,812 --> 00:09:18,668
because we have the same gas
with the same chemical composition,

139
00:09:18,668 --> 00:09:21,561
which absorbs the
background radiation.

140
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:27,089
So we can easily have
a combination of continuum and line spectra

141
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:30,065
where the lines can be 
in emission or in absorption.

142
00:09:30,065 --> 00:09:32,199
Here we show them only in absorption
but we could very well 

143
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:35,165
have them in emission,
as in the previous slide,

144
00:09:35,165 --> 00:09:38,246
in superposition with the 
continuous spectrum.

145
00:09:39,816 --> 00:09:43,432
Here is a situation where we 
have a continuous spectrum

146
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:48,681
where we have a heat source, for 
example the sun or any other star

147
00:09:48,681 --> 00:09:51,699
where we have a nuclear radiation 
source in the center,

148
00:09:51,699 --> 00:09:54,068
which will heat up the outer layers

149
00:09:54,068 --> 00:09:57,331
and the outer layers will re-emit what
we call black-body radiation

150
00:09:57,331 --> 00:10:00,000
at all wavelengths, 
in this case here

151
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,241
in the visible wavelength range
from blue to red.

152
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:06,870
All stars will show this
type of continuous radiation.

153
00:10:07,288 --> 00:10:11,307
Here is now a situation
where we have a line spectrum

154
00:10:11,307 --> 00:10:15,229
with the monochromatic lines
that we have shown earlier

155
00:10:15,229 --> 00:10:16,890
at certain frequencies or
certain wavelengths

156
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:23,943
We have a situation where
a molecular or atomic cloud

157
00:10:24,043 --> 00:10:29,460
is ionised by a source of ionisation
here, for example stars.

158
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:35,942
The stars will excite the atomic gas.

159
00:10:35,942 --> 00:10:38,364
We will come back to that 
in the following videos.

160
00:10:38,364 --> 00:10:42,994
The gas will be excited by the photons emitted
by the stars and, through de-excitation,

161
00:10:42,994 --> 00:10:47,960
atoms will emit lines,
which will be carateristic 

162
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,681
of the chemical composition of the gas.

163
00:10:53,744 --> 00:10:56,456
The line-spectra inform us
of the chemical composition and

164
00:10:56,456 --> 00:11:01,037
the physical conditions of the medium:
a gas which was ionised,  

165
00:11:01,037 --> 00:11:04,784
excited by a radiation source 
such as stars.


166
00:11:07,114 --> 00:11:09,797
We have seen before 
that most of the spectra

167
00:11:09,797 --> 00:11:13,413
are a combination of a continuous spectrum and a line spectrum.

168
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:14,907
Here is a good example.

169
00:11:14,907 --> 00:11:17,300
We have here a background source.

170
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:21,152
A hot source,

171
00:11:21,156 --> 00:11:23,413
which emits a continuous spectrum.

172
00:11:23,413 --> 00:11:27,290
For example a star which emits
a black-body radiation spectrum.

173
00:11:29,877 --> 00:11:34,651
And on the line of sight, between 
the background stars and us

174
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,590
lies for example 
a gas with atoms

175
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,277
and molecules.

176
00:11:43,178 --> 00:11:47,068
This colder gas will absorb
light

177
00:11:47,068 --> 00:11:50,057
at well defined wavelengths
which depend

178
00:11:50,057 --> 00:11:52,040
on the chemical composition of the gas.

179
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:55,113
Here again we can learn things 
thanks to such a spectrum,

180
00:11:55,113 --> 00:11:59,343
of the background source but also 
of the chemical composition of the gas

181
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:02,433
over the line of sight to 
the background source.

182
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:07,986
Here is a concrete example of a spectrum
composed of a continuum

183
00:12:07,986 --> 00:12:10,817
 and of absorption lines,

184
00:12:10,817 --> 00:12:13,503
the spectrum of a star 
whose name is here.

185
00:12:13,503 --> 00:12:16,043
We can see here the 
surface temperature  : 15 000K.

186
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:19,617
Its a hot blue star
whose black-body spectrum

187
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:23,098
can be seen here

188
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:30,020
and which also displays
a whole series of lines.

189
00:12:31,576 --> 00:12:33,559
If we zoom in on the lines here,

190
00:12:33,675 --> 00:12:36,331
We can see them here,
stretching the wavelength axis

191
00:12:36,331 --> 00:12:39,121
we see that there are lots of lines,
which here are due

192
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:42,053
to hydrogen in 
the stellar atmosphere.

193
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:45,948
This is for a star other 
then the sun.

194
00:12:45,948 --> 00:12:48,452
Now let's look at what 
happens in the sun.

195
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:51,282
If one took a spectrum of the sun,
what would one have?

196
00:12:51,282 --> 00:12:58,750
Well, we have the sun with
a surface temperature of 5780K.

197
00:12:59,056 --> 00:13:00,787
That is our hot source. 

198
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:05,041
The sun, of course,
has an atmosphere.

199
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:09,593
So, the sun's surface is here, 
but let's tell that

200
00:13:09,593 --> 00:13:12,475
the upper atmosphere of the sun 
is around here.

201
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:14,207
This contains hydrogen. 

202
00:13:16,427 --> 00:13:20,550
So we have here the situation we had 
before, where we had a hot source,

203
00:13:21,472 --> 00:13:25,117
the sun's surface,
with light

204
00:13:25,117 --> 00:13:30,063
that travels to the eye and then,
in between,

205
00:13:30,063 --> 00:13:34,641
we have the hydrogen surface, 
which we have shown here.

206
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:41,693
So we have the sun's core producing
radiation due to nuclear reactions

207
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:43,477
which will heat the sun's surface,

208
00:13:43,477 --> 00:13:48,711
and the gas in the atmosphere of the sun
will form the lines we have seen

209
00:13:48,711 --> 00:13:51,161
in the spectrum shown earlier.

210
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:53,634
All stars display this kind of spectrum:

211
00:13:53,634 --> 00:13:57,682
a continuum component due to the
heating of their surface

212
00:13:57,682 --> 00:14:01,515
from the inner nuclear reactions
and at some point

213
00:14:01,515 --> 00:14:06,590
absorption lines just above their surface due to 
hydrogen which is cooler then the surface.

214
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:12,599
That said, one can also have
emission lines

215
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:15,153
next to the surface if the physical
conditions

216
00:14:15,153 --> 00:14:18,966
and the temperature of the star are right.

217
00:14:19,052 --> 00:14:22,080
We have seen that light can be 
distributed into two components,

218
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:25,647
one continuous, and one discrete, i.e.
the line spectrum.

219
00:14:25,647 --> 00:14:29,851
Let's see in a bit more detail which 
physical processes can be 

220
00:14:29,851 --> 00:14:32,032
responsible for the continuous spectra.

221
00:14:32,289 --> 00:14:37,084
As we have just seen,
the sun or the stars display

222
00:14:37,084 --> 00:14:39,854
a black-body spectrum.

223
00:14:39,854 --> 00:14:43,231
Let's also look at two other
radiation processes which will generally 

224
00:14:43,231 --> 00:14:45,717
 take place in galaxy clusters

225
00:14:45,717 --> 00:14:47,740
or in places where
a magnetic field is present. 

226
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:51,993
For instance, the Compton scattering
or Bremsstrahlung-radiation

227
00:14:51,993 --> 00:14:54,533
which will take place in ionised gases

228
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:57,521
or synchrotron radiation
which takes place when

229
00:14:57,521 --> 00:15:02,696
magnetic field lines are
present in the interstellar medium,

230
00:15:02,696 --> 00:15:06,028
intergalactic medium or around
astronomical objects.

231
00:15:06,028 --> 00:15:09,473
First of all, black body radiation:

232
00:15:09,473 --> 00:15:14,206
it is a radiation which is created
by a heat source.

233
00:15:15,006 --> 00:15:18,010
Stars are excellent 
black bodies.

234
00:15:18,010 --> 00:15:21,873
We will come back to them
in the following videos

235
00:15:21,873 --> 00:15:28,188
The spectrum of this black body
is a Planckian curve,

236
00:15:28,944 --> 00:15:35,080
which depends only 
on the temperature.

237
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:39,954
The position of the emission peak here,

238
00:15:39,954 --> 00:15:42,467
depends only on the temperature.

239
00:15:43,951 --> 00:15:50,820
Here we have a black body 
with a temperature of 6000K.

240
00:15:51,361 --> 00:15:57,869
Here we have a black body corresponding 
to the temperature of the sun : 5780K

241
00:15:58,359 --> 00:16:07,383
and there colder and colder stars ,
down to T=4500K

242
00:16:08,493 --> 00:16:14,833
The colder a black body is, the more 
in the red its radiation peak will be.

243
00:16:14,833 --> 00:16:20,445
We can already deduce, knowing only that 
a star has a black body radiation spectrum

244
00:16:20,445 --> 00:16:24,642
and knowing that the radiation peak will
move with the temperature,

245
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:28,441
that a star that radiates most
of its light

246
00:16:28,441 --> 00:16:31,438
in the short wavelengths, will be bluer

247
00:16:31,438 --> 00:16:34,851
than a star which radiates 
at longer wavelengths

248
00:16:34,851 --> 00:16:37,077
and with a lower temperature.

249
00:16:37,077 --> 00:16:40,095
So, a hot star will appear blue

250
00:16:40,095 --> 00:16:42,725
while a cold star will appear red.

251
00:16:43,425 --> 00:16:46,795
The second type of continuous radiation
which can be relevant,

252
00:16:46,795 --> 00:16:49,909
especially when we have a hot,
 ionised gas,

253
00:16:49,909 --> 00:16:55,289
is the Compton scattering of electrons
in a proton gas,

254
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:56,600
which is actually a plasma.

255
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,634
This radiation is also called 
Bremsstrahlung radiation,

256
00:16:59,634 --> 00:17:01,324
or "braking radiation" in german.

257
00:17:01,324 --> 00:17:04,441
"Braking" because electrons 
are accelerated,

258
00:17:04,441 --> 00:17:12,477
namely, they will be accelerated 
by ions with a charge Ze here,

259
00:17:12,477 --> 00:17:15,151
and here we have an electron.

260
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:19,422
So each time an electron will 
move near a proton

261
00:17:19,422 --> 00:17:21,323
it will be accelerated and,

262
00:17:21,323 --> 00:17:24,996
when an electron moving already at high speed
is accelerated ,

263
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:27,996
it emits a photon in a random
direction.

264
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:30,646
Thus, it is an isotropic radiation.

265
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:33,273
While passing through, the
electron loses energy

266
00:17:33,273 --> 00:17:36,683
therefore it is slowed down or braked,
which is where the name comes from.

267
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:42,431
This is something we meet in 
hot gases like plasmas.

268
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:45,198
Heat is needed to dissociate atoms,

269
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:51,232
that is, the nucleus from the electrons, 
to get a gas of ions and electrons,

270
00:17:51,232 --> 00:17:53,158
namely a plasma.

271
00:17:53,158 --> 00:17:55,630
The shape of the spectrum
is given here.

272
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:02,514
we had fν fλ before. Here we rather
use the specific intensity lν.

273
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:06,708
So this is the curve
describing the shape of the spectrum.

274
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,554
We can see that we also have a continuous 
function with an exponential here.

275
00:18:11,554 --> 00:18:16,956
So the temperature of the gas or the plasma
is important here.

276
00:18:17,214 --> 00:18:21,679
Then we have the density of ions and 
electrons in the plasma.

277
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,512
We can compute easily, by
doing 

278
00:18:24,512 --> 00:18:27,834
an integral over all frequencies,

279
00:18:27,834 --> 00:18:31,498
the total available power for 
all wavelengths,

280
00:18:33,158 --> 00:18:36,162
in other words the luminosity of the object.

281
00:18:37,533 --> 00:18:41,684
This radiation is isotropic and is relevant
 to very massive objects

282
00:18:42,793 --> 00:18:44,613
where gravitational contraction 
will heat the gas,

283
00:18:44,613 --> 00:18:46,230
such as galaxy clusters.

284
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:50,101
So we will have plasmas with 
electrons that interact with ions

285
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:54,915
and each time we have an acceleration with a

286
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,404
uniform or at least 
continuous distribution,

287
00:18:58,404 --> 00:19:01,393
as soon as we have a continuous
distribution of accelerations,

288
00:19:01,393 --> 00:19:06,120
we will also have a continuous energy 
distribution of the emitted photons.

289
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:08,600
Therefore, that spectrum is also continuous.

290
00:19:10,612 --> 00:19:12,802
And finally, yet another type
of continuous radiation,

291
00:19:13,045 --> 00:19:14,823
the synchrotron radiation.

292
00:19:14,823 --> 00:19:16,578
It is the same type of radiation 
as observed

293
00:19:16,578 --> 00:19:18,157
in particle accelerators. 

294
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:21,326
It is a radiation which will cause
the particles to slow down.

295
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:27,310
Here we have an electron which 
starts spiralling 

296
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:31,051
around a magnetic field line.

297
00:19:31,599 --> 00:19:34,437
Obviously, each time we have a loop like this,

298
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:36,926
we also have a centripetal acceleration

299
00:19:37,881 --> 00:19:41,024
and like in the case of Bremsstrahlung radiation

300
00:19:41,024 --> 00:19:42,486
we will have

301
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:44,961
emission of photons.

302
00:19:44,961 --> 00:19:48,049
But here the photons will be emitted
in a well-defined direction

303
00:19:48,049 --> 00:19:52,644
because the electrons are channelled by the 
magnetic field lines.

304
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:57,734
We note that, in the case 
of Bremsstrahlung radiation,

305
00:19:57,734 --> 00:20:01,477
the electrons had 
to interact with ions.

306
00:20:01,477 --> 00:20:05,156
To produce ions, atoms had to separate into electrons and ions

307
00:20:05,156 --> 00:20:06,721
and therefore a heat source was
needed.

308
00:20:06,721 --> 00:20:09,047
Thus, we spoke of "thermal radiation".

309
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:12,716
Here we have a magnetic field that
does not need

310
00:20:12,716 --> 00:20:16,919
extreme temperatures, and
the gas can even be really cold.

311
00:20:16,919 --> 00:20:19,510
So one speaks of "non-thermal radiation".

312
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:21,920
In both case, for the 
Bremsstrahlung

313
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:25,280
and for the synchrotron radiation,
we have continuous radiation.

314
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,916
In the Bremsstrahlung case,
the radiative intensity

315
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:33,270
depends on temperature
and electronic density.

316
00:20:33,270 --> 00:20:38,326
Here the radiation depends
on the intensity

317
00:20:38,326 --> 00:20:43,371
of the magnetic field 
and electronic density.

318
00:20:44,046 --> 00:20:47,575
We have a directional radiation.

319
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:50,151
So if we can observe 
this type of radiation

320
00:20:51,282 --> 00:20:54,773
as a function of the observed brightness,
we will get information

321
00:20:54,773 --> 00:20:58,803
on the intensity of the magnetic field 
at that location

322
00:20:58,803 --> 00:21:01,715
and on the electronic density.

323
00:21:02,715 --> 00:21:05,022
Here on one slide we summarise

324
00:21:05,043 --> 00:21:09,270
the various types of radiation and 
especially the synchrotron radiation.

325
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:13,070
So what we see here are 
two multi-band images,

326
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:15,007
i.e. observed at several 
wave lengths,

327
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:17,102
of the Crab nebula: Messier 1

328
00:21:17,102 --> 00:21:20,052
A supernova exploded
in 1054,

329
00:21:20,052 --> 00:21:22,960
and what we see here are
the residues of the explosion.

330
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:28,080
This is an image taken at
three optical wavelengths

331
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,539
and combined into a single image.

332
00:21:29,539 --> 00:21:32,809
And here we have an image where we combine
optical radiation 

333
00:21:32,809 --> 00:21:35,713
and X ray radiation.

334
00:21:35,713 --> 00:21:38,362
We note that the nebula looks 
very different

335
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:39,789
at different wavelengths.

336
00:21:39,789 --> 00:21:42,233
What happens at each locations?

337
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:46,120
Here in the optical radiation, if we
took a spectrum of the nebula,

338
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,442
if we looked at what goes on 
in these filaments,

339
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:55,324
we would see a line spectrum, in
particular hydrogen and

340
00:21:55,324 --> 00:21:58,202
helium lines which are the 
most abundant elements

341
00:21:58,202 --> 00:22:02,112
in the stars and also in 
the remains of supernovas.

342
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,112
By studying the spectrum of these filaments,
one can even determine

343
00:22:05,112 --> 00:22:09,209
their temperature, which ranges
from 10 000K to 20 000K

344
00:22:09,209 --> 00:22:16,737
and their radial velocity which,
measured through the Doppler effect, reaches 
about 1500km/s .

345
00:22:16,737 --> 00:22:19,326
Now, if we look at the 
image on the right,

346
00:22:19,337 --> 00:22:21,272
we have a totally diferent picture,

347
00:22:21,272 --> 00:22:25,232
Especially the radiation, 
the blue part here

348
00:22:25,232 --> 00:22:27,525
which corresponds to the red 
part in this image,

349
00:22:27,525 --> 00:22:32,468
which  is the optical diffuse radiation,
but we can also see a radiation,

350
00:22:32,468 --> 00:22:35,497
here, which is directional.

351
00:22:35,497 --> 00:22:41,033
Actually the X-ray radiation is shown 
here in blue.

352
00:22:41,033 --> 00:22:44,233
That is a radiation that is emitted tangentially
along the magnetic field lines.

353
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:48,560
We have here a synchrotron radiation,
due to a magnetic field

354
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,320
created by a pulsar,
a residual star

355
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,190
which, after a supernova explosion, 

356
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:55,238
spins very fast

357
00:22:55,238 --> 00:22:57,320
and produces a magnetic field

358
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,915
around the lines of which electrons will spiral.

359
00:22:59,915 --> 00:23:03,480
Thanks to the study of optical radiation, 
we can determine

360
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:06,880
the chemical composition
of the gas around the supernova

361
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,754
and obtain the expansion velocity
of the nebula

362
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:11,577
from the observed velocity of the filaments.

363
00:23:11,577 --> 00:23:13,187
We also know the chemical composition.

364
00:23:13,187 --> 00:23:18,685
Thanks to the X-ray emission, one can determine
the plasma density,

365
00:23:18,685 --> 00:23:23,753
hence that of the gas of electron and ions, and 
the intensity 

366
00:23:23,753 --> 00:23:26,034
of the magnetic field in the nebula.

367
00:23:26,034 --> 00:23:28,558
The radiation processes 
we have just seen

368
00:23:28,558 --> 00:23:30,241
are not the only possible ones.

369
00:23:30,241 --> 00:23:34,128
Nevertheless, they are the main processes
encountered in astrophysics

370
00:23:34,128 --> 00:23:36,872
to explain the astronomical objects
that we see.

371
00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:39,739
They are our main tools
to study the universe.

372
00:23:39,739 --> 00:23:44,500
In the following videos we will
focus on two processes

373
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,477
that are especially important in 
astrophysics.

374
00:23:46,477 --> 00:23:50,330
One of them is a continuous radiation,
the black body spectrum

375
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:56,145
and the second is the line spectrum 
emitted by an atomic or molecular gas.
