1
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,570
In this lecture, we will see more details
about black-body radiation

2
00:00:10,570 --> 00:00:15,360
and the spectral lines produced for example
by an atomic or molecular gas.

3
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,820
The black body, first of all, caracterises
heated bodies

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:23,710
that re emit radiation at all wavelengths.
For instance, that is the case of a light

5
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:27,519
bulb filament that converts
electric energy into light.

6
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,449
That is the case of glowing embers which,
due to the heating by the flames,

7
00:00:31,449 --> 00:00:38,890
will radiate at all wavelengths.
It is also the case of lava ejected by volcanoes.

8
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:42,289
This blackbody radiation is characterised
by

9
00:00:42,289 --> 00:00:47,630
what we call the Planckian curve
which gives the energy distribution as a function

10
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:53,690
of wavelength
or as a function of frequency.

11
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:58,449
The units of this luminance (or specific intensity)
is a power

12
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:05,210
by surface unit, by steradian,
for radiation that is emitted in all directions

13
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:10,170
and optionally by wavelength unit as shown
here on that axis,

14
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:17,270
or by frequency unit.
These Planckian curves have a bell shape

15
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,320
with an increasing and decreasing slope and
so also a maximum.

16
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:29,939
The position of this maximum can be calculated
by deriving the function which gives the luminance.

17
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,210
If we do it here, as a function of wavelength
we will find that the maximum of the curve

18
00:01:34,210 --> 00:01:39,360
will occur
at a position that depends only upon the temperature.

19
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:44,140
We have therefore a linear relation between
the position of the maximum

20
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,329
of the black body curve and the black body
temperature.

21
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:54,729
So here we have a constant in m.K.
We can have it in Å.K, which is more useful

22
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:58,259
with the units we use
in astrophysics, in the wavelength range

23
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,950
used in astrophysics.
We can see here the position of the maximun

24
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:10,090
of the black body curve
for a black body temperature of 6000K.

25
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:19,531
Or here for a temperature of 5780K.
That is the surface temperature of the sun

26
00:02:19,531 --> 00:02:25,620
for example.
and these curves show different temperatures,

27
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:40,379
here 5500K,
5000K and 4500K.

28
00:02:40,379 --> 00:02:46,200
Stars are excellent black bodies.
So we can immediately see that λmax decreases

29
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,080
when T increases.
We can indeed observe it here.

30
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,659
A high temperature yields a peak emission
in the short wavelengths, the bluer ones.

31
00:02:56,659 --> 00:03:00,440
And lower temperatures result in emission
peaks

32
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:04,380
that lie at higher wavelengths, the redder
ones.

33
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:09,300
Since we have red on this side of the spectrum
and blue on that side,

34
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:17,659
in the optical wavelengths range
A hot star will appear blue

35
00:03:17,659 --> 00:03:26,019
while a cold stellar object will appear red.
So of course this Wien's displacement law

36
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:30,930
which gives the position of the maximum
of the black body peak as a function of temperature

37
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,660
can be expressed in wavelengths or in frequencies.
depending on whether we express the luminance

38
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,209
as a funtion of wavelength
or frequency.

39
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:42,629
And looking at the two equations we tend to
feel that

40
00:03:42,629 --> 00:04:01,990
(λmax x T) x (νmax/T) should be equal to
λmax x νmax

41
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:08,040
of course, but also equal to c.
Actually that is not the case.

42
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,180
If we take the numerical values here, we can
see that we have 0.57 * c

43
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:21,410
and that comes from the fact that Bν is not
equal to Bλ,

44
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:28,660
but is equal to Bλ * dλ/dν as we have shown
in a previous lecture

45
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:37,700
and so is equal to Bλ x λ²/c.
Another feature which will interest us,

46
00:04:37,700 --> 00:04:42,880
is of course the total energy, the energy
flux density

47
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,630
developed by a stellar object which radiates
black body radiation,

48
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:51,620
in other words the whole of the luminance
at all wavelengths

49
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:55,550
or at all frequencies.
So once the integration is done the available

50
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:58,670
energy
once we have integrated the black body for

51
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:04,760
example here, under the orange curve,
the result of the integral is the density

52
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:15,890
of the energy flux which is simply
proportional to the temperature to the fourth.

53
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:19,760
So we have here a proportionality constant
which is of course a power

54
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,620
by surface unit and by Kelvin to the minus
4.

55
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:26,140
As soon as we have the black body temperature
we can determine

56
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:30,890
the radiated power by surface unit at the
surface of the black body.

57
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:39,240
So M, is simply the power emitted by a unit
surface

58
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:47,020
at the surface of the black body.
So now, what is the relation with stellar

59
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:51,990
luminosity?
The luminosity, is here the total energy freed

60
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:57,810
by the star,
The luminosity will be given in erg/s.

61
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:07,130
This luminosity, will be the surface of the
star multiplied by M.

62
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:18,880
So 4π r² * σ T^4, where we have here the
radius of the star.

63
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:23,870
The flux M will be integrated on the whole
surface.

64
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:31,690
And M is the available power by surface unit
at the surface of the black body here of the

65
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:37,190
star.
So now, we at the level of the earth,

66
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:45,700
we receive only part of that energy,
at a certain distance d.

67
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,590
If we are situated at a certain distance d,
we will recive a flux by surface unit: the

68
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:57,700
flux F here
which will be L diluted on a sphere of radius

69
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:02,180
4πd².
So the flux we are receiving, we on the ground,

70
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:11,380
is L / 4πd²,
that is receivend on earth.

71
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:21,000
For this, the unit of F will be erg by second
by cm squared

72
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,130
because it is diluted on a sphere of radius
d,

73
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:29,880
and also by Angstrom in case we are interested
in the spectroscopy

74
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:32,280
where we disperse the light as a function
of wavelength.

75
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:41,540
A lot of stellar objects emit black body radiation.
Our Sun to begin with, whose surface emits

76
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:45,210
in the visible wavelength range the energy
produced at the center of the Sun

77
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,660
by nuclear reactions.
The dust in the disks of spiral galaxies

78
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:54,980
is heated by young stars, found in the spiral
arms,

79
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,920
visible here on the right in the optical image
of the galaxy.

80
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,520
This energy emitted by the stars, is absorbed
by interstellar dust

81
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:10,430
and re emitted in the form of black body radiation
whose peak is situated in the infra-red wavelength

82
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:15,910
as can be seen here on the image to the right,
of the same galaxy but taken in the infra-red

83
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,240
wavelengths.
One of the most beautiful black bodies is

84
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,500
probably the cosmological black body
whose spectrum is shown here as a function

85
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,590
of frequency.
It is an isotropic micro-wave radiation which

86
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,800
is present everywhere in the universe
and whose origin lies in the Big Bang.

87
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:35,640
The universe which was extremely hot extended
itself and became colder,

88
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,300
emitting an ambiant radiation which corresponds
now,

89
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:44,520
13,7 billion years after the big bang
to a black body whose temperature is very

90
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:51,510
close to the absolute zero : 2,73K.
What you see here are the measurement points

91
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,520
in black,
and the theoretical curve as a solid line.

92
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:59,820
You see that theory and measurements perfectly
agree.

93
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,180
Black body radiation is certainly
one of the most common types of radiation

94
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:07,400
in astrophysics.
It produces a continuous spectrum.

95
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:10,570
The other type of frequently encountered spectrum
is the line spectrum

96
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:15,720
which we will see in a moment.
We had already talked about atomic lines in

97
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:19,200
a previous chapter.
We had taken the example of a relatively hot

98
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:25,900
star, here at 15000K.
Now that we have learned about black bodies,

99
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:29,750
we see that a hot star
essentially radiates in the blue wavelengths.

100
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:32,710
That is what happens here.
We have an extremely steep spectrum in the

101
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,880
blue
and we have a continuous one, which is the

102
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:39,420
black body spectrum
which is described by the Planckian curve.

103
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:46,390
Now, on top of that, we have a line spectrum,
with absorption lines in this case,

104
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:51,940
which are due to hydrogen atoms present in
the atmosphere,

105
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:58,040
in the upper layers of the stellar atmosphere.
Let's see in more details the line spectrum

106
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,310
produced in this case here
by the hydrogen atoms.

107
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,720
For that, let's go back to Bohr's atomic model
where the electron is in orbit around the

108
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,720
proton.
We obviously have an equilibrium between the

109
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:15,240
Coulomb force.
We have a proton and then an electron in orbit

110
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:23,800
around the proton,
namely, a hydrogen atom.

111
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,800
This is the mass times acceleration. This
is just the Newtons law here.

112
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,670
Quantum mechanics tells us that kinetic momentum
is quantified

113
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:40,270
and that the kinetic momentum takes an integer
value multiplied by a constant.

114
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:45,140
Here we have an integer value
times a constant, which is the h bar constant

115
00:10:45,140 --> 00:10:55,030
namely the Planck constant divided by 2π,
so h / 2π.

116
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,840
The two equations which we have written in
the previous slide

117
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:02,500
are simply Newton's law and the quantification
of kinetic momentum,

118
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,630
i.e. the fact that the kinetic momentum of
the electron around the proton

119
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,190
can take only very specific values.
These two equations will permit us to express

120
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:16,580
the total energy of the electron.
So the kinetic energy here and the potential

121
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:25,390
energy here,
as a function of n and the Planck constant,

122
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,630
so an integer value and the Planck constant,
rather then as a function of the radius and

123
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:33,490
the velocity of the electron.
So we have two equations with two unknowns,

124
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:37,680
the solution is trivial.
We come back to the total energy of the electron,

125
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,350
which will be negative
since the system is bound.

126
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:45,690
The total energy will depend upon a constant,
is negative

127
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:51,180
and will depend on the energy level characterised
by n,

128
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:54,180
which we defined earlier and which is responsible
for

129
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:59,470
the quantification of the kinetic momentum.
The energy of the electron is quantified.

130
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:05,180
The total energy will depend
on an integer value and a constant.

131
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:09,880
We recognise here a lot of physical constants:
the Planck constant divided by 2π,

132
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:16,950
the mass and charge of the electron
and the electrostatic permittivity constant

133
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:21,210
of vacuum ε0.
If we express all that in numerical terms

134
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:27,110
we find that this constant is
2.18 x 10^-18 Joules

135
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:30,730
It is an energy.
If we convert the result into a more useful

136
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:33,750
energy unit
for particle physics or astrophysics

137
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:38,960
or also for atomic physics, we find -13,6
eV.

138
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:43,029
So for the record, an electron-volt is the
energy acquired by one electron

139
00:12:43,029 --> 00:12:48,210
at rest when it is accelerated by a voltage
difference of 1 Volt.

140
00:12:48,210 --> 00:12:56,600
That is the definition of an electron-volt.
We saw that the total energy is quantified,

141
00:12:56,600 --> 00:13:01,120
so we have an energy that is a function of
the integer value n

142
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:08,940
and depends on the constant -13,6eV * (1/n²)
where in fact n characterises the orbit on

143
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:14,310
which moves
an electron around the proton.

144
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:20,470
We have a proton here and then we have an
electron that might be

145
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:29,810
on an orbit n1 or on an orbit n2.
The electron will be able to go from one orbit

146
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:34,050
to another
by gaining or losing energy.

147
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:41,250
If for example a photon is absorbed by an
atom

148
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:47,100
the electron will be able to go from the n1
layer to the n2 layer

149
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:50,570
by gaining energy.
Conversely, we can also have electrons

150
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:57,470
that are in the n2 layer, an "excited" layer,
and then will go back to the n1 layer.

151
00:13:57,470 --> 00:14:04,279
The atom will lose energy,
by emitting a photon with a certain energy

152
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:09,160
hν.
What the frequency of this photon will be

153
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,230
?
We can compute it by simply calculationg the

154
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,890
energy difference
between the atomic layers of the hydrogen

155
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:19,480
atom.
For example, the energy difference between

156
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,800
layers 1 and 2
can be expressed using the equation we have

157
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,880
seen before.
-13,6 times the difference of the numerical

158
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:36,850
constants here.
So (1/n1² -1/n2²) is of course in electron-volts.

159
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:39,960
It is also the energy that the photons will
have once emitted

160
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:46,100
by the hydrogen atoms that will go down
from the layer n2 to n1.

161
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:49,500
It is also the energy one has to bring to
an hydrogen atom to

162
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:58,770
raise an electron from layer n1 to layer n2.
We can summarize here in a figure what happens

163
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:02,550
in a hydrogen atom.
We said that we have multiple possible energy

164
00:15:02,550 --> 00:15:07,410
levels that correspond
each time to an integer value, from 1 to the

165
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:10,240
limit, infinity.
We could not represent here all the energy

166
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:13,540
levels
between the layer 5 and infinity.

167
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:17,150
But if we could zoom in we would see more
and more layers.

168
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:24,540
We can have all possible transitions
between a starting layer and arrival layers.

169
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,790
For example to go from the fundamental layer,
here,

170
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:37,580
to higher energy layers, one needs energies
that will be characterised

171
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:44,410
by photons whose wavelengths are written here.
So, if we want energies, high energy differences,

172
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,589
we need photons with short wavelengths
so with high frequencies and therefore high

173
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:54,250
energy differences.
Here have the first series of lines called

174
00:15:54,250 --> 00:16:01,490
the Lyman series,
which corresponds to all possible transitions

175
00:16:01,490 --> 00:16:06,900
between the fundamental layer and all other
atomic layers.

176
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:18,250
So if we supply an atom with an energy higher
then 13.6eV, the atom will get ionized.

177
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:24,850
In other words, it will lose its electron.
So an ionized gas is a gas transformed into

178
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:33,640
a mix of ions and electrons.
So for the Lyman series, we see that

179
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:39,190
the wavelengths are in the ultraviolet.
If we play the same game starting from layer

180
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:45,680
2 to all layers above it,
we get the so-called Balmer series

181
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:56,130
which, this time, is in the optical range.
Finally, if we start a bit further still,

182
00:16:56,130 --> 00:17:02,500
from the next energy level,
we will find the Paschen series, which is

183
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:11,230
in the infrared.
Of course there are other series, going further

184
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:13,720
and further
in wavelength

185
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:19,190
and to lower and lower energy differences.
Now lets go back to the example of a star

186
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:26,829
we had before
the star with a black body spectrum of 15000K

187
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:31,980
and whose radiation peak is located in the
blue part of the spectrum.

188
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:35,610
So we can recognise here some lines of the
Balmer series.

189
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:42,630
The Balmer series is here and we can see if
we want to predict

190
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:44,800
the wavelengths of the different transitions
here

191
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:52,090
that we have for example a line at 4861Å
which is actually the Hβ line.

192
00:17:52,090 --> 00:17:58,660
So this is 4861Å.
So if we look here we see exactly

193
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:03,560
the wavelength predicted by this formula.
If we look at the following line, we have

194
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:15,350
Hγ at 4341Å
which will be here.

195
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:21,030
The Hα line lies outside of
the wavelength range of this spectrum,

196
00:18:21,030 --> 00:18:24,200
so it is not visible.
If we went further and further down the blue

197
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:29,410
side of the spectrum,
we would have a whole series of lines, here,

198
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,220
from layer 2 to all the layers that we couldn't
represent

199
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:38,670
and that would be in this box here.
We haven't shown them here, since there would

200
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,630
be an infinity of arrows here.
That said, we can see them in the spectrum

201
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,500
of the star.
This multitudes of lines has a limit, here

202
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,930
we have a limit
that corresponds to the ionisation of the

203
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,050
atom.
So if an electron is on layer 2 and we provide

204
00:18:54,050 --> 00:18:59,980
it with a higher energy,
than the energy so to -3,39 eV, the atom will

205
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:05,960
lose its electron and so be ionised.
No lines will be formed since the atom doesn't

206
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:08,510
exist any more
as an atom.

207
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:11,809
We have a proton/electron pair, so an ionised
gas.

208
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:15,950
Here are all line series we can directly observe
in the spectrum of the star.

209
00:19:15,950 --> 00:19:18,880
There exists a wide variety of astronomical
objects

210
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:23,220
characterized by a line spectrum.
The line spectrum is often typical of the

211
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:27,780
interstellar medium where the atoms
excited by stellar radiation produce a spectrum

212
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:32,840
consisting almost exclusively in lines.
The latter inform us about the cheamical composition

213
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,429
of the gas
of which nebulae are made.

214
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:40,040
The same is true of planetary nebulae
where the differents gas layers are excited

215
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:43,791
by the radiation
of the white dwarf star lying at the centre

216
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:47,990
of the nebula.
And, closer to us, the polar aurorae we can

217
00:19:47,990 --> 00:19:51,230
see
during strong solar activity display also

218
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,090
a line spectrum.
We can see one here from the International

219
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,660
Space Station.
In this case the atoms in the upper layers

220
00:19:57,660 --> 00:20:03,090
of the terrestial atmosphere
are excited by collisions with the protons

221
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:07,490
and electrons from the Sun
that are captured in the terrestrial magnetic

222
00:20:07,490 --> 00:20:10,990
field.
It is by losing energy through de-excitation

223
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:15,460
that the atoms emit the polar auroras
which have a magnificent line spectrum.
