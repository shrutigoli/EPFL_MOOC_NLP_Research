1
00:00:04,330 --> 00:00:08,940
The main source, or even the only source of
information

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:15,420
coming from space are the photons.
Their energy distribution, meaning their colour,

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,990
and their quantity, which is their spectral
distribution

4
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,250
shown here in the optical domain from blue
to red,

5
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:27,250
inform us on the physical processes responsible
for the emission

6
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:30,620
and absorption of the radiation, therefore
of the photons,

7
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:34,449
but also on the physical properties of the
environment, namely the matter

8
00:00:34,449 --> 00:00:39,160
with which the radiation will interact.
As we have just mentioned, light is extremly

9
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:42,409
important
in astrophysics, because light carries energy

10
00:00:42,409 --> 00:00:44,480
as a wave
or as a particle.

11
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,909
This is the wave-particle duality.
The photons will convey a certain amount of

12
00:00:48,909 --> 00:00:53,640
energy
which will be quantified.

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,290
This energy is proportional to the frequency
of the photon.

14
00:00:59,290 --> 00:01:02,870
And the proportionality constant, which is
the Planck constant,

15
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:10,050
has the units of an angular momentum.
So in quantum physics, it's the angular momentum

16
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:13,690
that is quantified
and thus also the energy of the photons.

17
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:18,680
Obviously the frequency is related, as always,
to the wavelength

18
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,720
through the speed of light and the period
of oscillation of the wave

19
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:30,291
which is 1 divided by the frequency.
The energy is measured per unit of time, so

20
00:01:30,291 --> 00:01:37,740
it is actually a power.
If a star radiates a certain luminosity L,

21
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:42,990
the brightness will be measured for example
in ergs per second,

22
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:50,120
an energy unit divided by a time unit,
and that brightness, which we will have here,

23
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:58,960
will be captured
at a certain distance from the Earth,

24
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:08,140
here, at a distance d.
And we will capture it on a certain surface,

25
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:13,030
so we have here the isotropic radiation of
a star with total luminosity L.

26
00:02:13,030 --> 00:02:15,810
This radiation will be diluted on a sphere
of surface

27
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:22,480
4 π times the distance squared.
In the end, what we will receive on the ground,

28
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,630
is a certain flux of photons, a certain flux
of energy,

29
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:33,720
which will be the original luminosity L of
the star divided by 4 π d²

30
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,200
That is what we find here.
We have the luminosity, namely the energy,

31
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,110
actually the power
- energy divided by time - that will be distributed

32
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:46,240
isotropically,
on the surface of the sphere which is here,

33
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:49,660
and we only receive
a small part of the whole radiation.

34
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:54,470
We will also observe at certain specific wavelengths
or frequencies.

35
00:02:54,470 --> 00:02:57,700
So to go from the expression of a flux in
wavelength units

36
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:04,510
to a flux in frequency units,
it isn't enough to replace λ by ν.

37
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:10,260
Regardless of the way one measures the available
energy

38
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,849
in wavelength units or in frequency units
one has to have the same result.

39
00:03:16,849 --> 00:03:21,650
If I multiply the flux by a wavelength unit
or the flux expressed in frequency units by

40
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:28,080
a certain interval of frequencies
I need to obtain the same result, in absolute

41
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,950
values,
since λ and ν vary inversely.

42
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:39,550
Now, we said that λ = c / ν.
This implies that if I take the differential

43
00:03:39,550 --> 00:03:50,300
we have dλ = - (c /ν²) x dν.
If we replace dλ here, we obtain immediately

44
00:03:50,300 --> 00:04:01,170
that fν = (c / ν² )x fλ.
So the relation between the flux expressed

45
00:04:01,170 --> 00:04:05,680
in frequency units
and the flux expressed in wavelength units

46
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,480
is not totally obvious.
There is a slight distortion between the two

47
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:14,269
scales.
Photons do not only carry energy: note that

48
00:04:14,269 --> 00:04:17,840
energy
can be expressed in different ways for the

49
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,469
photons.
It can be written as E = hν,

50
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:27,229
but can also be written as the quadratic sum
of p x c + mc²

51
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:32,189
with the famous mass energy.
Now for photons, there is no mass energy

52
00:04:32,189 --> 00:04:38,259
but they still have a momentum.
Therefore we can write that E = p times c

53
00:04:38,259 --> 00:04:43,050
where p is the momentum.
Of course, one can reverse the equation and

54
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:53,300
get p = E/c = hν (for the photons) /c
Now what will happen, is that each time one

55
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:57,440
has for example,
a particle of matter or a dust particle,

56
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,650
a photon can be absorbed
During the absorption, all the momentum of

57
00:05:02,650 --> 00:05:06,639
the photon,
- because a photon is always entirely absorbed

58
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:10,311
or emitted -
all the momentum of the photon will be transfered

59
00:05:10,311 --> 00:05:12,490
here
to the particle or dust-particle.

60
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:22,990
So, during the transfer, the dp/dt of the
particle is just hν/c.

61
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:29,150
the whole momentum of the photon will be transferred
to the particle,

62
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:38,599
The dp/dt of the particle is a force, whose
norm is hν / c.

63
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:43,240
This force is extremely important in astrophysics.
It will play a role in the wole process of

64
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:50,129
star formation
through atomic or molecular cloud collapse.

65
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:58,309
This force is called radiation pressure
This force will be generated by a photon flux

66
00:05:58,309 --> 00:06:04,569
hitting particles,
atoms, molecules, dust particles.

67
00:06:04,569 --> 00:06:10,969
We have seen that light can transport energy.
It can also transport momentum,

68
00:06:10,969 --> 00:06:15,729
and transfer this momentum to matter,
therefore imprinting force on matter

69
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:20,560
Now how does the photon spectrum distribute
itself in energy?

70
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:25,849
The spectrum, this energy distribution, can
be discrete or continuous.

71
00:06:25,849 --> 00:06:30,129
In one case, we have a radiation where all
wavelengths

72
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:34,199
are present in the spectrum.
In the other case, only some wavelengths are

73
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:37,710
present,
so discrete lines will form the spectrum.

74
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:41,110
In most cases, astronomical objects will show
spectra

75
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:45,800
that are a combination of both types of radiation.
The physical processes at play behind these

76
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:50,729
types of emission
are not the same, and this is why we can study

77
00:06:50,729 --> 00:06:54,849
celestial bodies.
First of all, continuous radiation: we have

78
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:58,719
here a continuous spectrum.
Each photon which has been emitted from blue

79
00:06:58,719 --> 00:07:03,529
to red,
so here we show only the visible wavelength

80
00:07:03,529 --> 00:07:07,439
range,
each photon transports an energy hν, which

81
00:07:07,439 --> 00:07:13,389
we can also write
as a momentum,

82
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:19,559
and a wavelength which is equal to c/ν
so the wavelength and the frequency vary in

83
00:07:19,559 --> 00:07:22,469
opposite ways.
Here we recognise of course the blue, with

84
00:07:22,469 --> 00:07:29,929
the red on this side of the spectrum
the short wavelengths, so, small λ, are on

85
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:36,629
this side of the spectrum
large λ.

86
00:07:36,629 --> 00:07:41,249
It is the opposite for the frequencies.
Finally the most powerful phenomena...

87
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:50,319
So, more energy is transported at short wavelengths
or at high frequencies.

88
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:56,599
And here, less energy because the wavelengths
are larger

89
00:07:56,599 --> 00:08:02,060
and the frequencies shorter.
The energy distribution of the photons can

90
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,129
be continuous
or discrete.

91
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:13,139
This is the case in atomic or molecular clouds
where each photon has a well-defined energy.

92
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,179
For example here, we have a given photon with
an energy E1 = hν1.

93
00:08:18,179 --> 00:08:23,780
Here we have another photon with an energy
E2 = hν2.

94
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,349
This type of radiation is generally present
in nebulae,

95
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:31,370
atomic or molecular clouds, excited by ionisation
sources,

96
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:39,120
in other words, heating of matter.
For example, stars in a nebula.

97
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,740
Of course, most of the time we will have
a combination of both types of radiation.

98
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:48,880
For example here, we have a continuous radiation
which will superimpose itself

99
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,940
with a discrete radiation.
This happens when a background source is seen

100
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:59,520
through, for example a cold gaz cloud.
We will see that later on, where some wavelengths

101
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:07,330
are absorbed.
So here, again we have: E1 = hν1

102
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,810
E2 = hν2
where ν1 and ν2 are exactly the same frequencies

103
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:17,250
as in the previous slides.
because we have the same gas with the same

104
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:23,220
chemical composition,
which absorbs the background radiation.

105
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:28,720
So we can easily have a combination of continuum
and line spectra

106
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:33,690
where the lines can be in emission or in absorption.
Here we show them only in absorption but we

107
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:36,710
could very well
have them in emission, as in the previous

108
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:41,460
slide,
in superposition with the continuous spectrum.

109
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,300
Here is a situation where we have a continuous
spectrum

110
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:50,310
where we have a heat source, for example the
sun or any other star

111
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,340
where we have a nuclear radiation source in
the center,

112
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:57,590
which will heat up the outer layers
and the outer layers will re-emit what we

113
00:09:57,590 --> 00:10:01,560
call black-body radiation
at all wavelengths, in this case here

114
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,960
in the visible wavelength range from blue
to red.

115
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:08,950
All stars will show this type of continuous
radiation.

116
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,950
Here is now a situation where we have a line
spectrum

117
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,890
with the monochromatic lines that we have
shown earlier

118
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:23,920
at certain frequencies or certain wavelengths
We have a situation where a molecular or atomic

119
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:28,200
cloud
is ionised by a source of ionisation here,

120
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:37,590
for example stars.
The stars will excite the atomic gas.

121
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:39,990
We will come back to that in the following
videos.

122
00:10:39,990 --> 00:10:45,020
The gas will be excited by the photons emitted
by the stars and, through de-excitation,

123
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:55,340
atoms will emit lines, which will be carateristic
of the chemical composition of the gas.

124
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:58,890
The line-spectra inform us of the chemical
composition and

125
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:02,940
the physical conditions of the medium: a gas
which was ionised,

126
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:11,350
excited by a radiation source such as stars.
We have seen before that most of the spectra

127
00:11:11,350 --> 00:11:15,340
are a combination of a continuous spectrum
and a line spectrum.

128
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:20,880
Here is a good example.
We have here a background source.

129
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:25,040
A hot source,
which emits a continuous spectrum.

130
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,590
For example a star which emits a black-body
radiation spectrum.

131
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:36,400
And on the line of sight, between the background
stars and us

132
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:44,860
lies for example a gas with atoms
and molecules.

133
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:51,610
This colder gas will absorb light
at well defined wavelengths which depend

134
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,760
on the chemical composition of the gas.
Here again we can learn things thanks to such

135
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,740
a spectrum,
of the background source but also of the chemical

136
00:11:58,740 --> 00:12:05,550
composition of the gas
over the line of sight to the background source.

137
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:09,490
Here is a concrete example of a spectrum composed
of a continuum

138
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:14,870
and of absorption lines,
the spectrum of a star whose name is here.

139
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:17,990
We can see here the surface temperature : 15
000K.

140
00:12:17,990 --> 00:12:23,310
Its a hot blue star whose black-body spectrum
can be seen here

141
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:33,240
and which also displays a whole series of
lines.

142
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,370
If we zoom in on the lines here,
We can see them here, stretching the wavelength

143
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:40,010
axis
we see that there are lots of lines, which

144
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:43,730
here are due
to hydrogen in the stellar atmosphere.

145
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:50,130
This is for a star other then the sun.
Now let's look at what happens in the sun.

146
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:52,990
If one took a spectrum of the sun, what would
one have?

147
00:12:52,990 --> 00:13:00,750
Well, we have the sun with a surface temperature
of 5780K.

148
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:06,300
That is our hot source.
The sun, of course, has an atmosphere.

149
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:11,600
So, the sun's surface is here, but let's tell
that

150
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:14,150
the upper atmosphere of the sun is around
here.

151
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:20,680
This contains hydrogen.
So we have here the situation we had before,

152
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:26,680
where we had a hot source,
the sun's surface, with light

153
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:33,470
that travels to the eye and then, in between,
we have the hydrogen surface, which we have

154
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:39,260
shown here.
So we have the sun's core producing radiation

155
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:45,150
due to nuclear reactions
which will heat the sun's surface,

156
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:50,390
and the gas in the atmosphere of the sun will
form the lines we have seen

157
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:55,200
in the spectrum shown earlier.
All stars display this kind of spectrum:

158
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:58,260
a continuum component due to the heating of
their surface

159
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:03,380
from the inner nuclear reactions and at some
point

160
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:08,300
absorption lines just above their surface
due to hydrogen which is cooler then the surface.

161
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:16,670
That said, one can also have emission lines
next to the surface if the physical conditions

162
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:22,860
and the temperature of the star are right.
We have seen that light can be distributed

163
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:26,630
into two components,
one continuous, and one discrete, i.e. the

164
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:29,850
line spectrum.
Let's see in a bit more detail which physical

165
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:33,380
processes can be
responsible for the continuous spectra.

166
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:38,690
As we have just seen, the sun or the stars
display

167
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:44,170
a black-body spectrum.
Let's also look at two other radiation processes

168
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:47,270
which will generally
take place in galaxy clusters

169
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:53,550
or in places where a magnetic field is present.
For instance, the Compton scattering or Bremsstrahlung-radiation

170
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:58,300
which will take place in ionised gases
or synchrotron radiation which takes place

171
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:01,820
when
magnetic field lines are present in the interstellar

172
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:06,860
medium,
intergalactic medium or around astronomical

173
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:11,130
objects.
First of all, black body radiation:

174
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:16,960
it is a radiation which is created by a heat
source.

175
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:21,029
Stars are excellent black bodies.
We will come back to them in the following

176
00:15:21,029 --> 00:15:25,779
videos
The spectrum of this black body is a Planckian

177
00:15:25,779 --> 00:15:37,210
curve,
which depends only on the temperature.

178
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:45,620
The position of the emission peak here,
depends only on the temperature.

179
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:53,030
Here we have a black body with a temperature
of 6000K.

180
00:15:53,030 --> 00:16:00,070
Here we have a black body corresponding to
the temperature of the sun : 5780K

181
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:10,060
and there colder and colder stars , down to
T=4500K

182
00:16:10,060 --> 00:16:16,340
The colder a black body is, the more in the
red its radiation peak will be.

183
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:21,920
We can already deduce, knowing only that a
star has a black body radiation spectrum

184
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:26,310
and knowing that the radiation peak will move
with the temperature,

185
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:32,630
that a star that radiates most of its light
in the short wavelengths, will be bluer

186
00:16:32,630 --> 00:16:38,140
than a star which radiates at longer wavelengths
and with a lower temperature.

187
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:45,070
So, a hot star will appear blue
while a cold star will appear red.

188
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:48,940
The second type of continuous radiation which
can be relevant,

189
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:53,670
especially when we have a hot, ionised gas,
is the Compton scattering of electrons in

190
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:58,460
a proton gas,
which is actually a plasma.

191
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:01,350
This radiation is also called Bremsstrahlung
radiation,

192
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:05,819
or "braking radiation" in german.
"Braking" because electrons are accelerated,

193
00:17:05,819 --> 00:17:14,199
namely, they will be accelerated by ions with
a charge Ze here,

194
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:19,110
and here we have an electron.
So each time an electron will move near a

195
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:22,980
proton
it will be accelerated and,

196
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,389
when an electron moving already at high speed
is accelerated ,

197
00:17:26,389 --> 00:17:32,340
it emits a photon in a random direction.
Thus, it is an isotropic radiation.

198
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,840
While passing through, the electron loses
energy

199
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:38,570
therefore it is slowed down or braked, which
is where the name comes from.

200
00:17:38,570 --> 00:17:42,519
This is something we meet in hot gases like
plasmas.

201
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:49,309
Heat is needed to dissociate atoms,
that is, the nucleus from the electrons, to

202
00:17:49,309 --> 00:17:54,799
get a gas of ions and electrons,
namely a plasma.

203
00:17:54,799 --> 00:18:00,440
The shape of the spectrum is given here.
we had fν fλ before. Here we rather use

204
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:06,070
the specific intensity lν.
So this is the curve describing the shape

205
00:18:06,070 --> 00:18:11,240
of the spectrum.
We can see that we also have a continuous

206
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:15,590
function with an exponential here.
So the temperature of the gas or the plasma

207
00:18:15,590 --> 00:18:21,159
is important here.
Then we have the density of ions and electrons

208
00:18:21,159 --> 00:18:26,070
in the plasma.
We can compute easily, by doing

209
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:34,820
an integral over all frequencies,
the total available power for all wavelengths,

210
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:41,910
in other words the luminosity of the object.
This radiation is isotropic and is relevant

211
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:46,409
to very massive objects
where gravitational contraction will heat

212
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:48,710
the gas,
such as galaxy clusters.

213
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:52,049
So we will have plasmas with electrons that
interact with ions

214
00:18:52,049 --> 00:18:56,929
and each time we have an acceleration with
a

215
00:18:56,929 --> 00:19:02,019
uniform or at least continuous distribution,
as soon as we have a continuous distribution

216
00:19:02,019 --> 00:19:05,779
of accelerations,
we will also have a continuous energy distribution

217
00:19:05,779 --> 00:19:12,320
of the emitted photons.
Therefore, that spectrum is also continuous.

218
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,210
And finally, yet another type of continuous
radiation,

219
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:18,970
the synchrotron radiation.
It is the same type of radiation as observed

220
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:22,600
in particle accelerators.
It is a radiation which will cause the particles

221
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:28,980
to slow down.
Here we have an electron which starts spiralling

222
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:36,080
around a magnetic field line.
Obviously, each time we have a loop like this,

223
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:42,590
we also have a centripetal acceleration
and like in the case of Bremsstrahlung radiation

224
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:46,630
we will have
emission of photons.

225
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:49,730
But here the photons will be emitted in a
well-defined direction

226
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:54,970
because the electrons are channelled by the
magnetic field lines.

227
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:59,370
We note that, in the case of Bremsstrahlung
radiation,

228
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:05,389
the electrons had to interact with ions.
To produce ions, atoms had to separate into

229
00:20:05,389 --> 00:20:08,830
electrons and ions
and therefore a heat source was needed.

230
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:13,480
Thus, we spoke of "thermal radiation".
Here we have a magnetic field that does not

231
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:16,269
need
extreme temperatures, and the gas can even

232
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:21,169
be really cold.
So one speaks of "non-thermal radiation".

233
00:20:21,169 --> 00:20:25,619
In both case, for the Bremsstrahlung
and for the synchrotron radiation, we have

234
00:20:25,619 --> 00:20:29,119
continuous radiation.
In the Bremsstrahlung case, the radiative

235
00:20:29,119 --> 00:20:34,929
intensity
depends on temperature and electronic density.

236
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:45,679
Here the radiation depends on the intensity
of the magnetic field and electronic density.

237
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:52,850
We have a directional radiation.
So if we can observe this type of radiation

238
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,330
as a function of the observed brightness,
we will get information

239
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:00,340
on the intensity of the magnetic field at
that location

240
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:06,049
and on the electronic density.
Here on one slide we summarise

241
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:10,940
the various types of radiation and especially
the synchrotron radiation.

242
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:16,929
So what we see here are two multi-band images,
i.e. observed at several wave lengths,

243
00:21:16,929 --> 00:21:21,749
of the Crab nebula: Messier 1
A supernova exploded in 1054,

244
00:21:21,749 --> 00:21:24,520
and what we see here are the residues of the
explosion.

245
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:31,409
This is an image taken at three optical wavelengths
and combined into a single image.

246
00:21:31,409 --> 00:21:34,450
And here we have an image where we combine
optical radiation

247
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:39,919
and X ray radiation.
We note that the nebula looks very different

248
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,540
at different wavelengths.
What happens at each locations?

249
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,789
Here in the optical radiation, if we took
a spectrum of the nebula,

250
00:21:47,789 --> 00:21:53,000
if we looked at what goes on in these filaments,
we would see a line spectrum, in particular

251
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,869
hydrogen and
helium lines which are the most abundant elements

252
00:21:59,869 --> 00:22:05,799
in the stars and also in the remains of supernovas.
By studying the spectrum of these filaments,

253
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:09,440
one can even determine
their temperature, which ranges from 10 000K

254
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,840
to 20 000K
and their radial velocity which, measured

255
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,789
through the Doppler effect, reaches about
1500km/s .

256
00:22:16,789 --> 00:22:23,320
Now, if we look at the image on the right,
we have a totally diferent picture,

257
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:28,870
Especially the radiation, the blue part here
which corresponds to the red part in this

258
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:31,390
image,
which is the optical diffuse radiation, but

259
00:22:31,390 --> 00:22:37,440
we can also see a radiation,
here, which is directional.

260
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,739
Actually the X-ray radiation is shown here
in blue.

261
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:46,740
That is a radiation that is emitted tangentially
along the magnetic field lines.

262
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:50,220
We have here a synchrotron radiation, due
to a magnetic field

263
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:55,200
created by a pulsar, a residual star
which, after a supernova explosion,

264
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:58,970
spins very fast
and produces a magnetic field

265
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:03,799
around the lines of which electrons will spiral.
Thanks to the study of optical radiation,

266
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,119
we can determine
the chemical composition of the gas around

267
00:23:07,119 --> 00:23:11,309
the supernova
and obtain the expansion velocity of the nebula

268
00:23:11,309 --> 00:23:15,230
from the observed velocity of the filaments.
We also know the chemical composition.

269
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:19,710
Thanks to the X-ray emission, one can determine
the plasma density,

270
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:25,480
hence that of the gas of electron and ions,
and the intensity

271
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:30,110
of the magnetic field in the nebula.
The radiation processes we have just seen

272
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,940
are not the only possible ones.
Nevertheless, they are the main processes

273
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:37,779
encountered in astrophysics
to explain the astronomical objects that we

274
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:41,179
see.
They are our main tools to study the universe.

275
00:23:41,179 --> 00:23:46,159
In the following videos we will focus on two
processes

276
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:50,869
that are especially important in astrophysics.
One of them is a continuous radiation, the

277
00:23:50,869 --> 00:23:54,169
black body spectrum
and the second is the line spectrum emitted

278
00:23:54,169 --> 00:23:56,120
by an atomic or molecular gas.
