1
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:10,710
We have seen in the previous lesson
the principal radiation processes in astrophysics.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,190
Radiation can be collected by telescopes,
or by antennas depending on the wavelength

3
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:19,359
range.
Observatories can be placed on the ground,

4
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,280
if the atmosphere doesn't interact too much
with the radiation from stellar objects,

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:29,340
or in space.
For every case, we need to be able to quantify,

6
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,370
we have to measure the radiation.
We will see in the following how astronomers

7
00:00:33,370 --> 00:00:36,440
measure the luminous flux, the colour of the
stellar objects,

8
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,719
and how to estimate
the luminous power of stellar objects.

9
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:45,239
How can one analyse light?
Either on analyses light through the spectrum.

10
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:48,089
So the luminous intensity in function of the
wavelength.

11
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:51,469
Or one integrates light through filters,
where we filter

12
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:56,850
only certain wavelengths
thanks to filters which have here a transmission

13
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,370
curve
The high end of the curve is where we let

14
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:03,999
pass the
most light at a certain wavelength.

15
00:01:03,999 --> 00:01:07,110
and the low sections of the curve, is where
less light goes through.

16
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,120
So these filters are actually
optical filters, which we put behind a telescope.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:15,039
So here we have a blue filter, for example,
which lets only pass blue light

18
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:20,740
and blocks out any other wavelength.
So we can have lots of series of filters.

19
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:26,360
Here is a red filter.
and here another one, even redder.

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:35,700
and here another one redder still.
So light will be filtered.

21
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,329
Here we have
4 optical filters which we can give names

22
00:01:39,329 --> 00:01:43,060
to.
For example this one is the B filter for blue.

23
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,469
V for green or visual.
R for the red filter.

24
00:01:47,469 --> 00:01:51,780
and here I for infra-red.
The eye starts not being able to see

25
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,259
at the wavelengths beyond these or below these.
Cameras can however,

26
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:59,450
see very well at these wavelengths.
So the goal of a filter,

27
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:07,609
is to select ranges of wavelengths.
Once the wavelength ranges are selected

28
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:13,870
one can integrate the light in the filters
and see the spatial distribution of the light.

29
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:18,250
And that is, of course, an image
So here we have the B filter, we will integrate

30
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:23,480
the light here in a certain filter.
So we multiply the spectrum by the transmission

31
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,550
curve
and integrate it over all wavelengths

32
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:33,060
This will give us the flux in a certain bandwidth.
and the flux in the bandwidth, in function

33
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,960
of the spatial position,
is an image.

34
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:42,420
An image is the luminous intensity at a certain
wavelength,

35
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,610
and at a certain pixel.
So we can take images at all wavelengths.

36
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:50,850
Here we have the image corresponding to the
blue filter,

37
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:57,590
for the 5555 angströms filter
of the Hubble Space telescope.

38
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,000
We can do of course the same thing
at different wavelengths.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,340
So we integrate the flux in one wavelength
range and note

40
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:09,090
the value of the minor flux in function of
the position.

41
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:11,640
So we get here, for example, an infra-red
image

42
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:17,260
at a wavelength of 8140 angströms.
So here we have a galaxy as seen by the Hubble

43
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:20,830
Space telescope
at a red wavelength, here almost infra-red.

44
00:03:20,830 --> 00:03:27,480
and at a blue wavelength, here almost ultraviolet.
What can we see in these images?

45
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,870
On the left here, we see an image taken with
the Hubble Space telescope

46
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:35,120
of a galaxy, and here the same galaxy, with
the same field of view

47
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:41,060
taken with a infra-red filter.
What we see is obviously different since objects

48
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,960
have different spectra's,
some objects will appear more clearly on the

49
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:47,271
blue filter,
and others will appear more clearly on the

50
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:52,290
red filter.
So we see some objects of this type.

51
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:57,370
If we look here, for example,
we see a star that has a weak luminous flux

52
00:03:57,370 --> 00:04:01,820
in the optical wavelengths
but a strong one in the infra-red.

53
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:07,110
We know already, here, that that star is a
red star.

54
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,400
Now there are star formation zones in galaxies.
Stars, we have seen in the lesson about black

55
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:17,150
body radiation,
when they are young, hot and massif radiate

56
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:22,100
more in the blue.
That is why we see here star formation zones

57
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:27,730
which appear strongly in blue filters..
But the contrast with other regions

58
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:33,180
is less distinct in the red filter.
So we have here a zone where stars are young,

59
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,380
hot,
massif and blue.

60
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:39,660
And so radiate more in the blue then in the
red.

61
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:46,680
We can have certain dust zones, for example.
We have here one, in the spiral arms of the

62
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:50,430
galaxy.
Dust absorbs strongly blue light,

63
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:55,250
but much less red light
So we have a contrast here

64
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,160
which is very strong between dust zones and
the rest

65
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:04,540
of the galaxy in blue while the contrast
is much weaker here in the blue.

66
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,060
That is simply because rad light passes trhough
dust more easyly

67
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:14,780
then blue light.
A way of visualising this, is to make an image

68
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,910
in true colors.
It is more a "false colour" images but where

69
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,870
the colours are coded
so that the eye finds the color map

70
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:27,170
which it is used to.
To take an image in true colours, we take

71
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:33,460
a spectrum, or in other words
we take an image, we have for example a spectrum,

72
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:40,010
we will symbolise the spectrum like this
and then we take the filter, for example

73
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:43,400
the blue one from the space telescope.
we will integrate the light over a certain

74
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:49,530
range of wavelengths.
We will take the red filter we had before.

75
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:53,390
We will integrate the light here, where we
have the blue filter,

76
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:55,889
the red filter and in this case we even added
the

77
00:05:55,889 --> 00:06:01,050
optical H-alpha filter, which you will remember,
is one the most important lines of the hydrogen

78
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:04,730
atom.
This line

79
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:11,840
is at 6563 angströms,
If we visualised it on this spectrum,

80
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:17,440
it would be something rather narrow like this.
This line is typical of star formation.

81
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,470
and therefore it is interesting, which is
what has been done here,

82
00:06:20,470 --> 00:06:24,810
to add a narrow filter,
which is the H-alpha filter which will catch

83
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:32,770
just that narrow hydrogen line.
So now we will make an RGB image,

84
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:39,070
so red, green (Visual) and blue.
The blue part of the image,

85
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:42,169
the blue pixels will be coded with the image
that was taken

86
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:53,490
with the blue filter, the B-filter.
For the green part of the image,

87
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,930
the red optical image will be used and then
we will take

88
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:04,220
the H-alpha line for the red part.
Each time a pixel has a high flux,

89
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,520
in this image it will appear red.
When it has a high flux in this image it will

90
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,330
appear blue.
and if it has a high flux in this image it

91
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:14,760
will appear green.
Now we can combine all this into one image,

92
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:17,500
we take a weighting of the same pixel in the
three images

93
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:24,520
and then make a colour image.
In this colour image, we can see, for example,

94
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,930
the star we saw before, which was very red,
or at least

95
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:31,610
the point that was in the image and that was
very red.

96
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,980
We see the blue star formation zones, there
are lots

97
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:40,900
of small blue points that are massive stars
in formation,

98
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:45,450
Almost formed but which emit very blue radiation
so very hot black bodies.

99
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:50,110
And then we find a certain number of red zones,
here for example.

100
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:53,880
So that,
is the H-alpha radiation.

101
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,270
The pixel with high flux in this image here,
H-alpha,

102
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:01,930
appear in red in the image.
When you see this image in false colours,

103
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:06,660
they are not just there to be pretty.
We can easily see, here, the physical processes

104
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:12,630
that can cause different types of radiation.
So in blue young, hot and massif stars.

105
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:19,260
In red, gas zones ionised by massive stars.
Each time we have massive stars, we see them

106
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:24,320
directly in blue.
But we see them also by the ionisation they

107
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:27,050
cause
in the hydrogen clouds.

108
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:32,150
There we see the hydrogen H-alpha line
which is produced by excitation of the hydrogen

109
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,950
atoms
which de-energise themselves by emitting the

110
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:41,599
famous H-alpha line.
So astronomers like using logarithmic scales

111
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,620
to quantify the luminous fluxes and the luminosities.
We have already seen the luminosity, for example

112
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:52,410
of a star,
at a certain wavelength, lets say L lambda.

113
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:56,649
And this star is situated at a certain distance
from us.

114
00:08:56,649 --> 00:09:00,860
We will capture the radiation at a certain
distance d.

115
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:04,240
and this radiation will be diluted, if it
is isotropic,

116
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:12,490
over a sphere with a surface of 4 pi d².
So here we will have the flux F lambda,

117
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:17,100
and this F lambda flux will be equal to, as
we have seen before, L lambda,

118
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:23,360
so the luminosity divided by 4 pi times the
square of the distance.

119
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,369
Now,
to take into account what the ancients saw

120
00:09:28,369 --> 00:09:32,420
and with the logarithmic scale of the eye,
the astronomers have decided to measure the

121
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:38,009
luminous flux,
not in flux, but in magnitude over a logarithmic

122
00:09:38,009 --> 00:09:41,380
scale.
This logarithmic scale is defined as:

123
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:47,389
-2.5 log (flux)
at a certain wavelength, lambda in this case

124
00:09:47,389 --> 00:09:51,600
here.
Now we can also integrate the flux though

125
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:59,939
a filter,
so we can define for example, if X is a filter,

126
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:07,630
for a certain bandwidth,
for example B,V,R ou I as we defined earlier.

127
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:12,979
So X can be one of those letters
The magnitude of the X filter will be

128
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:24,430
- 2.5 log base 10
of the integral F lambda d lambda.

129
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:31,129
In other words we will have
mx equals - 2.5 log

130
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:38,170
of the total flux in X band.
This flux in a flux expressed in erg by seconds,

131
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,100
so a power by cm². So we have no angströms
anymore

132
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:47,420
because we integrated over all wavelengths.
We have a power by cm², which is a power

133
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:51,970
flux.
So now, how do we calibrate our flux scale

134
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:56,199
?
In fact the calibration, will be the Vega

135
00:10:56,199 --> 00:11:00,189
star,
an extremely bright star in the northern hemisphere.

136
00:11:00,189 --> 00:11:04,029
So we define the magnitude as being equal
to zero in the V filter

137
00:11:04,029 --> 00:11:09,470
Lets see how this works, we take an object
of which we want to measure the magnitude

138
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:14,629
and the Vega stars, so alpha in the Lyre constellation.
And we will integrate the flux of the object

139
00:11:14,629 --> 00:11:20,860
in the V band.
Here we have the transmission of the V band.

140
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:29,079
We will do the same with the Vega star.
Here we have a certain flux

141
00:11:29,079 --> 00:11:33,759
in the V band of our object.
and here we have the flux in the V band of

142
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:40,230
the Vega star.
Of course we can do that with any other band.

143
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:46,529
So the flux in the V band, will be by definition
the integral of F lambda times the transmission

144
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:53,480
of the V d lambda filter.
And then, to simplify, we normalise

145
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:57,999
and say that the transmission integral of
the filter

146
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:01,119
is equal to 1.
In other words, we erase that term from the

147
00:12:01,119 --> 00:12:05,680
equation above.
Now the flux will rescaled in function of

148
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,639
Vega,
which means that the magnitude of the V filter,

149
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:18,079
of our object,
will be - 2.5 log of the flux

150
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:23,389
in the V band of the object,
rescaled to the flux in the V band of the

151
00:12:23,389 --> 00:12:27,620
Vega star.
So this flux divided by this flux,

152
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:31,430
we take the log minus 2.5 and we have the
magnitude of our object.

153
00:12:31,430 --> 00:12:34,709
There is something here we don't see
because in fact, we said that this,

154
00:12:34,709 --> 00:12:38,300
is also equal to the magnitude in the V band
of the object.

155
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:41,709
minus the magnitude in the V band of Vega
and this is equal to :

156
00:12:41,709 --> 00:12:45,290
Now by definition,
the Vega magnitude in the V band is equal

157
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:51,429
to zero.
So the magnitude of the object is the same

158
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:55,329
as this one.
Therefore the magnitude of an object,

159
00:12:55,329 --> 00:13:00,040
equals -2.5 log of the flux.
and it is always rescaled to Vega.

160
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,019
So we know by how much something is more luminous
or less luminous then Vega,

161
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,800
on a logarithmic scale, in a certain band,
here the V band.

162
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,500
And there is this -2.5 factor that
transforms the objective or "quantitative"

163
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:16,910
scale
to a more subjective scale that is the

164
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:21,129
logarithmic scale of the human eye which is
of course the scale used

165
00:13:21,129 --> 00:13:24,690
by the ancients to characterise the brightness
of the stars.

166
00:13:24,690 --> 00:13:28,119
So we have measured the flux of objects in
different boundaries in function

167
00:13:28,119 --> 00:13:32,619
of the flux of Vega in different boundaries.
Now we will measure the flux ratio

168
00:13:32,619 --> 00:13:37,310
of the same object but this time,
with different boundarie. For example, here,

169
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:41,610
we will have the measured flux ratio for an
object in the V band.

170
00:13:41,610 --> 00:13:48,510
So Fv of the object and we will compare this
to the flux of the same object in the I band.

171
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,350
In other words, what we measure here,
is the slope of the spectrum between the two

172
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:55,980
bands.
And this slope has to be calibrated, so we

173
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:01,149
will measure it in function
of the same flux ratio between two bands for

174
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:05,379
the Vega star.
I will measure the slope of my spectrum

175
00:14:05,379 --> 00:14:08,749
in function of the slope of the spectrum of
the Vega star.

176
00:14:08,749 --> 00:14:15,260
So here I will define notations.
We have Fv of Vega,

177
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:22,600
and here Fi of Vega.
and now, if we express all that in magnitudes,

178
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:28,069
the magnitude of my object in the V band
minus the magnitude of my object in the I

179
00:14:28,069 --> 00:14:30,600
band,
we find the following equation,

180
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:37,999
from what we have seen in the earlier slides:
This is simply the magnitude difference,

181
00:14:37,999 --> 00:14:42,220
of my object in function of Vega,
between the V band and the I band.

182
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:48,420
Now we can rearrange a bit the equation.
I can write mv minus mi.

183
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:53,410
Here after rearranging the equation,
what we measure here is the flux ratio of

184
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:57,119
our object
in the V band in function of the I band.

185
00:14:57,119 --> 00:15:02,529
We compare this to the Vega flux ratio
in the V band in function of the I band.

186
00:15:02,529 --> 00:15:06,819
In other words,
we look at the relative slope of my object

187
00:15:06,819 --> 00:15:09,879
in function of the relative slope of the Vega
spectrum.

188
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:13,480
So we look at the colour of the object,
compared to that of Vega.

189
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,110
So in practice we will use
different colour indexes.

190
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:26,630
So instead of writing m indexed V and I,
often we will write in big letter like this.

191
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:32,559
For example V minus I, B minus V,
and we will define colour indexes,

192
00:15:32,559 --> 00:15:35,220
and in these colour indexes, we will always
put

193
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:43,339
the bluest filter left.
With these conventions, a big colour index

194
00:15:43,339 --> 00:15:50,720
will be typically a red object,
and a weak colour index will be a blue object.

195
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:58,769
For example B - V big is typically a red object.
so redder then Vega.

196
00:15:58,769 --> 00:16:05,060
and B - V small will be a blue one,
so bluer then Vega,

197
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:10,649
since everything is scaled to the Vega star.
So we have defined the fluxes, the luminosities,

198
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:14,680
the magnitudes,
and the colour of the stars and stellar objects

199
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:16,799
in general.
We will now define another

200
00:16:16,799 --> 00:16:20,980
extremely important quantity in astrophysics:
the absolute magnitudes.

201
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:25,649
In fact the magnitude of an object seen at
a distance of 10 parsecs.

202
00:16:25,649 --> 00:16:29,209
So we will say that absolute magnitudes are
in fact visual

203
00:16:29,209 --> 00:16:35,529
magnitudes : the small m we saw earlier,
seen from a distance of 10 parsecs.

204
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:40,769
That is the magnitude
of an object, if it is seen from 10 parsecs

205
00:16:40,769 --> 00:16:47,369
So of course the visual magnitude,
which is - 2.5 log of the flux,

206
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:51,889
where the flux is again what we defined before
L.

207
00:16:51,889 --> 00:16:58,839
That is the luminosity of an object,
diluted over a certain surface here where

208
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:06,100
we have a certain flux.
And the flux is equal to 4 pi d².

209
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:10,250
So the absolute magnitude, will - 2.5 log
of flux,

210
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:13,870
when d is equal to 10 parsecs.
We can calculate the difference between the

211
00:17:13,870 --> 00:17:18,389
2 magnitudes :
the visual magnitude rescaled to Vega

212
00:17:18,389 --> 00:17:23,850
and the magnitude at ten parsecs.
So again we use the definition of magnitudes

213
00:17:23,850 --> 00:17:34,320
-2.5 log.
So the flux, is L divided by 4 pi d²

214
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:39,100
and the absolute magnitude as we said,
is the flux of the object if it is seen from

215
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:44,039
10 parsecs away.
So we use here already the right units: four

216
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:50,320
pi times ten squared.
Now, we see that this is equal to -2.5

217
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,760
lof of ten squared over d squared.
In other words, m minus M,

218
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:02,169
is equal to 5 log d - 5.
And that is an absolutely fundamental equation

219
00:18:02,169 --> 00:18:06,940
in astrophysics.
A key result

220
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:09,960
since it is this equation which allows us
to measure distance,

221
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,149
thanks to, for example, standard candles,
supernovas or Cepheid stars

222
00:18:14,149 --> 00:18:17,370
which we will see later.
This is called the distance module with d

223
00:18:17,370 --> 00:18:24,080
in parsecs.
By definition,

224
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,580
the difference between apparent magnitude
and absolute magnitude,

225
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:34,200
is + 5 log(d) in parsecs -5
So we can immediately see that if we can get

226
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:38,830
an object for which we measure
the apparent magnitude and for which we know,

227
00:18:38,830 --> 00:18:43,590
in an independent manner the absolute magnitude,
we will be able to know its distance.

228
00:18:43,590 --> 00:18:46,159
The measurement of the distance is one of
the tasks

229
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:50,549
are extremely important in astrophysics.
Measuring the distances and the mass,

230
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:54,020
are two key components
for the understanding of the formation and

231
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,570
evolution
of stellar objects.

232
00:18:56,570 --> 00:19:00,690
Now some orders of magnitudes,
magnitudes of well known objects.

233
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:07,250
So here we have the apparent magnitude for
a series of objects.

234
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:11,100
And here we have the absolute magnitude of
different objects.

235
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:15,269
So this is the absolute magnitude.
This is of course the apparent magnitude

236
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:19,100
that an object would have if it was placed
placed at a distance of 10 parsecs.

237
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:24,140
So the Sun has the smallest magnitude
of all objects in the sky,

238
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:27,510
so it the brightest object, in appearance
at least.

239
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:31,720
Because if we put it at 10 parsecs its magnitude
is plus 4.8.

240
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,169
Plus 4,8, is around
the magnitude that the almost invisible to

241
00:19:35,169 --> 00:19:39,990
the naked eye objects have.
So the Sun, at a distance of 10 parsecs, would

242
00:19:39,990 --> 00:19:42,700
be a weak star indistinguishable from the
rest,

243
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:48,000
in fact almost invisible to the naked eye.
So, now, at the complete opposite of the scale,

244
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:52,880
we take an extremely weak object,
with a high, positive magnitude,

245
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:57,429
so for example some very distant quasars.
These ibjects are almost invisible

246
00:19:57,429 --> 00:20:01,809
with the biggest actual telescopes.
And if we put these object at a distance of

247
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,850
10 parsecs,
they have a magnitude of minus 30.

248
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:08,159
So they would be,
if they were at ten parsecs from us, a lot

249
00:20:08,159 --> 00:20:10,570
brighter,
three magnitudes brighter then the Sun.

250
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,690
So we can see through this comparison of apparent
magnitudes

251
00:20:13,690 --> 00:20:17,240
and absolute magnitude, to which degree the
distance of the stars

252
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,210
dominates what we perceive from their radiation.
The challenge in astrophysics is to imagine,

253
00:20:22,210 --> 00:20:25,000
to modelize
the physical processes that account for the

254
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:28,230
received radiation.
This radiation can be captured

255
00:20:28,230 --> 00:20:32,620
in form of an image or a spectrum.
It is these and only these,

256
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:35,419
that will permit us to understant the fonctionning
of the stars

257
00:20:35,419 --> 00:20:36,639
that compose the universe.
