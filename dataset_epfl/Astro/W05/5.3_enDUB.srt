1
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:10,230
We have introduced the HR diagram, the colour-magnitude
diagram

2
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,330
and we have seen where each type of star is
located in it

3
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:17,170
depending on its mass, luminosity, colour
and size.

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,360
In what follow we will see in a very simplified
manner

5
00:00:20,360 --> 00:00:24,090
how stars evolve in the diagram during their
life,

6
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:29,820
how they are born, how they burn
their hydrogen into helium and how they eventually

7
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,640
die,
depending on their luminosity and their initial

8
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,329
mass.
How do stars form ?

9
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:42,980
By fragmentation of a cloud of dust and gas.
We have here a cloud which fragments into

10
00:00:42,980 --> 00:00:48,329
several pieces
the size and mass of which obey some distribution.

11
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:55,410
The cloud fragments
and the resulting pieces have to meet Jeans'

12
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:00,889
criteria :
you remember that, in the previous chapter,

13
00:01:00,889 --> 00:01:07,290
we had introduced Jeans' mass and Jeans' radius.
If the fragments are large or massive enough,

14
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:13,290
they may collapse and contract.
The initial clouds have some mass distribution

15
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:25,030
that we can represent on a log/log scale here.
The curve has usually this shape and is called

16
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:36,320
the initial mass function.
This initial mass function gives the distribution

17
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,480
of nebula fragments
in units of solar masses.

18
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:48,210
We have on this axis the decimal logarithm
of the number of fragments.

19
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:57,850
This point is more or less two,
here is the 0 and here is minus 2.

20
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:01,860
There are many fragments of small mass and
a few fragments of large mass.

21
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:08,770
We have here more or less 0.1 solar masses,
here are 100 solar masses and finally here

22
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:16,100
is the 0
since it is a logarithmic scale.

23
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:22,680
The zero corresponds to one solar mass.
Most stars weigh roughly one solar mass.

24
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:26,280
This is the initial mass function, giving
the mass distribution

25
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,410
of the fragmenting clouds.
These fragmenting clouds appear

26
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:39,760
in the colour-magnitude diagram
along a roughly vertical sequence that I schematize

27
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,590
here.
This sequence is called the Hayashi track.

28
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:52,459
This sequence is isothermal, everything is
at the same temperature.

29
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,360
We have here the log of temperature, the log
of luminosity,

30
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:59,569
the absolute magnitude is represented here
and decreases upwards,

31
00:02:59,569 --> 00:03:04,530
therefore the luminosity increases upwards.
Here is the colour index

32
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:10,209
with rather blue stars in this area on the
left and red stars over there.

33
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:16,800
The nebula fragments will spread over the
Hayashi track.

34
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,740
Their mass distribution is given here and
they are distributed

35
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:25,410
along this line.
Imagine here, on various locations, various

36
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:29,290
stars with different masses
which are actually protostars.

37
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:36,830
At this stage, stars are convective.
The motion at the centre of the star

38
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:42,209
is turbulent, going in all directions.
The material inside is mixed and the star

39
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:50,410
contracts.
At this stage there is not any nuclear reaction

40
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:52,770
yet.
Remember that according to the Virial theorem,

41
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:57,590
if the radius decreases
the temperature of the core increases

42
00:03:57,590 --> 00:04:01,010
and it will do so until igniting the nuclear
reactions.

43
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:09,190
At this point the contraction is slowed down.
The contraction is slowed down by two phenomena

44
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,880
: radiative pressure
due to photons emitted by the contraction

45
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:16,009
of the star
and the internal heating of the star, and

46
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:20,100
of course the gas pressure
due to the turbulences.

47
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:33,180
When the star contracts, it becomes
more and more opaque. The medium becomes opaque

48
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:39,490
which means that the luminosity decreases.
The Hayashi track is an isothermal curve,

49
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:48,770
which means that
during the contraction T stays constant.

50
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:59,410
Remember that L = 4πR²σT^4.
L decreases while T is constant

51
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:02,490
and all other quantities but the radius are
constants.

52
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:07,470
Therefore R decreases.
The star's luminosity decreasing at a constant

53
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:13,030
temperature
implies that the star is contracting.

54
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:17,270
While the external temperature stays constant,
the star is contracting

55
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:22,160
but the temperature increases in the centre
up to the point of starting nuclear reactions.

56
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:27,550
For each star, with here a massive one as
an example,

57
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:36,040
the star's luminosity decreases when it contracts
and the nuclear reactions start.

58
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,940
When the nuclear reactions ignite, the star
increases in temperature until reaching a

59
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:46,570
position
on the main sequence.

60
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:55,730
So on this point we have the start of nuclear
reactions.

61
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,240
Of course at the start of nuclear reactions
the temperature increases very quickly

62
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,270
until reaching an equilibrium between the
radiative pressure

63
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:08,870
of the photons, the gas pressure and the gravity.
The ignition of nuclear reactions

64
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,009
is as fast as the star is massive.
A star of small mass will drop slower along

65
00:06:14,009 --> 00:06:19,850
the Hayashi track before moving to the main
sequence.

66
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:26,889
Stars of even very small mass tend to migrate,
to start very slowly their nuclear reactions.

67
00:06:26,889 --> 00:06:32,729
We see that we left from a mass sequence
defined by the initial mass function

68
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:43,180
and we reach another mass sequence, which
is the main sequence.

69
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:47,590
The heavier stars are at the top and the lighter
stars at the bottom.

70
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:53,900
What happens once on the main sequence ?
Stars burn their hydrogen.

71
00:06:53,900 --> 00:07:03,280
We have thus nuclear reactions
of fusion of hydrogen nuclei into helium nuclei.

72
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,310
This can happen in two different ways
with a more or less complicated reaction chain.

73
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:14,520
The limit between the two possible reactions
is at 1.3 solar masses.

74
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:25,259
Over 1.3 solar masses, stars burn
their hydrogen into helium following the CNO

75
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:29,520
cycle.
Under 1.3 solar masses, we have

76
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:41,919
the proton-proton chain.
Contrarily to what the name suggests,

77
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,210
the CNO cycle produces neither carbon, nitrogen
nor oxygen.

78
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,620
The proton-proton chain involves essentially
protons.

79
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:57,060
but the outcome of both reactions is the fusion
of four hydrogen nuclei

80
00:07:57,060 --> 00:08:01,930
into one helium nucleus.
The CNO cycle requires higher temperatures

81
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:07,430
than the proton-proton cycle.
We have therefore a limit in temperature which

82
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:16,030
corresponds of course to a mass limit.
What is really important to remember is that

83
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,919
when a star is on the main sequence, it burns
its hydrogen into helium.

84
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:23,569
This is what stars do during the longest part
of their life.

85
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:27,800
On the main sequence, there is an equilibrium
between gas pressure,

86
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:45,040
radiative pressure and gravity.
In the star, there is

87
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:55,190
hydrogen burning into helium
and emitting photons in all directions.

88
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:58,460
Then there is the gas pressure.
And finally in the opposite direction there

89
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:05,660
is the star's own gravity
which tends to make it collapse.

90
00:09:05,660 --> 00:09:08,570
What are the phenomena occurring in stars
when they are on

91
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,520
the main sequence ?
There are nuclear fusion reactions along the

92
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,750
whole main sequence
with different kinds of reactions depending

93
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:21,029
on the mass being
above or below 1.3 solar masses.

94
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:29,850
Another important limit is at 8 solar masses.
We will see that this limit determines how

95
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:35,630
the stars die.
Let us consider a star on the main sequence

96
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:41,800
and heavier than 8 solar masses.
The star is burning its hydrogen into helium.

97
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:50,860
I draw here this star.
It burns hydrogen into helium

98
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,190
and is in a state of equilibrium between pressure
and gravity.

99
00:09:54,190 --> 00:10:03,190
Once the fusion of hydrogen stops,
both gas and radiative pressure decrease

100
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:06,580
and gravity wins.
Two things happen at this stage. First the

101
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:16,480
star cools down
and second the external layers are ejected.

102
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:28,050
The core will in turn contract
and the external layers expand

103
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:32,269
Now two things happen.
First, the radius of the star increases.

104
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:37,670
At the same time, the external layers cool
down, T decreases

105
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:49,180
and the star becomes redder.
Meanwhile the core warms up.

106
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:52,500
Heating continues until igniting the next
nuclear reactions.

107
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:56,820
The core of the star begins to fuse helium
into carbon.

108
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:04,550
While the star is still on the main sequence,
the hydrogen reactions stop,

109
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:08,290
the stellar radius increases and the surface
temperature decreases.

110
00:11:08,290 --> 00:11:15,330
This means that a star
tends to move to the right of the diagram

111
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:21,300
to the domains of lower temperatures and redder
surface colours.

112
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:28,440
Another star here will follow the same pattern.
For a very massive star, the core contracts

113
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:31,940
and starts the reaction fusing helium into
carbon.

114
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:37,250
This happens roughly in this area.
At this stage the star obviously warms up

115
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:41,540
and we have therefore a "knee" in direction
of hot temperatures.

116
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:51,140
There is a succession of nuclear reactions.
We have the burning of helium into carbon.

117
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:56,190
When this reaction stops, the star moves again
to the right of the diagram

118
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:01,230
and the next reaction starts, etc.
Each reaction is shorter in time than the

119
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:04,380
previous one.
After a while we reach the reaction of iron

120
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:13,399
fusion.
The iron fusion reaction is endothermic

121
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:17,480
rather than exothermic.
When the iron reaction starts in the core

122
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:21,090
of the star,
not only there is no emitted photon and no

123
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:24,029
pressure
directed outward but there is also energy

124
00:12:24,029 --> 00:12:27,060
absorption.
The star will therefore quickly collapse

125
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:38,829
and eventually releases a supernova.
For stars heavier than 8 solar masses

126
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:46,180
there is a succession of nuclear reactions.
There is a succession of nuclear reactions

127
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,790
and core contractions
until reaching the endothermic iron reaction

128
00:12:51,790 --> 00:13:00,920
and thus the explosion of the star.
Beyond 8 solar masses all stars follow such

129
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,660
a trajectory.
They become giants and zigzag.

130
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:09,240
The number of zigzags, namely the number of
distinct nuclear reactions depends on the

131
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,850
mass.
And we have then an explosion into a type

132
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:17,930
II supernova.
If the star is originally extremely massive,

133
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:34,900
there may remain after the supernova explosion
a neutron star or a black hole.

134
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:41,790
What happens for stars of smaller mass ?
The mass limit is 8 solar masses.

135
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:47,769
What happens now for stars below 8 solar masses
?

136
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:50,560
Actually it is more or less the same thing
as before.

137
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,740
Stars evolve into giant stars
and cool down to a certain location

138
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:01,399
on the colour-magnitude diagram.
They first get redder.

139
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:05,370
Then the external layers inflate and the core
contracts

140
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,980
probably up to start a new nuclear reaction
but without going all the

141
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:14,490
way to the iron reaction.
Iron fusion is not possible because the mass

142
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:20,399
of the star is too small.
Other reactions than hydrogen and helium burning

143
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:24,589
can then start
but without going to the iron reaction.

144
00:14:24,589 --> 00:14:30,490
What happens is that the external layers inflate
and the core contracts.

145
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:37,029
The external layers are expanding.
As for the core, it contracts until

146
00:14:37,029 --> 00:14:42,350
it cannot ignite the following nuclear reaction
and the star simply dies.

147
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:48,579
The external layers turn into a planetary
nebula

148
00:14:48,579 --> 00:14:55,380
with at its centre a dead star, a white dwarf
that radiates simply as it cools down.

149
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,920
There are also stars with an even smaller
mass.

150
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:07,670
There are other mass limits : 0.08 solar masses
and 0.26 solar masses.

151
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:13,060
Those are stars that form directly into white
dwarves

152
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,410
from the protostellar cloud
with a mass in this range, and do not form

153
00:15:17,410 --> 00:15:20,839
from the cloud
left by a massive star dying into a white

154
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,470
dwarf.
We have thus a white dwarf, which is located

155
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,589
roughly here
on the colour-magnitude diagram.

156
00:15:30,589 --> 00:15:38,230
If the mass is even smaller than 0.08 solar
masses

157
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:41,339
the mass is not large enough to start nuclear
reactions

158
00:15:41,339 --> 00:15:47,850
and we witness the formation of a brown dwarf.
Such a star shine only under the effect of

159
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:53,089
its gravitational contraction
which is what we saw in the slides about

160
00:15:53,089 --> 00:15:57,010
the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale
There is simply a conversion of potential

161
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,529
energy into radiation
as the star contracts very slowly

162
00:16:00,529 --> 00:16:04,699
under the effect of its own gravity.
But there is not any nuclear reaction.

163
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:09,900
Let us now see how the colour-magnitude diagram
can be used to date a star population.

164
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:13,430
A star population is simply a bunch of stars,
for example

165
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:22,290
a globular cluster that we saw several times
during the course, or an open cluster

166
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:26,800
and these stars are all formed at the same
time.

167
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:33,760
Stars are distributed along a mass sequence,
the main sequence.

168
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:37,570
Stars on the main sequence are burning their
hydrogen.

169
00:16:37,570 --> 00:16:42,000
Be attentive that the more massive a star
is, the faster

170
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:54,360
it burns its hydrogen.
In other words, a star will leave the main

171
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,770
sequence quicker
all the more massive it is,

172
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:03,160
the higher they are on the main sequence.
We have what are called evolutionary tracks.

173
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:08,569
Stars will evolve and reach
different locations on the diagram, more or

174
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,100
less like that.
I draw shorter and shorter tracks simply because

175
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:15,959
they cool down :
a star of smaller mass ignites the nuclear

176
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,659
reaction
following the hydrogen to helium one

177
00:17:18,659 --> 00:17:22,720
faster than other stars.
We have evolutionary tracks that look like

178
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:26,929
that,
I am not drawing them exactly.

179
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:34,859
We have then these tracks here.
The most massive stars

180
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:41,320
leave the main sequence very quickly.
Stars with a slightly smaller mass leave it

181
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,740
a bit afterwards
and so on and so forth.

182
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:46,080
If I link all these points I have what is
called

183
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:57,929
an isochronous curve, which as the name suggests
links stars with all the same age.

184
00:17:57,929 --> 00:18:05,399
I can here draw an isochronous curve like
that.

185
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:11,690
You see a knee on the isochrone.
There are stars leaving the main sequence,

186
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:16,889
having the required mass to soon leave the
main sequence.

187
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:27,359
I may also have another isochronous line
such as this one, and so on.

188
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:35,899
The higher the knee, the smaller this distance
and the younger the cluster is.

189
00:18:35,899 --> 00:18:39,200
If it follows the main sequence the cluster
has an age of 0

190
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,389
and stars are starting to migrate towards
the giant branch,

191
00:18:42,389 --> 00:18:47,179
doing so as fast as they are massive.
Of course, the lower the knee on the main

192
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:50,409
sequence is,
the older the cluster is.

193
00:18:50,409 --> 00:18:57,230
Here are a few examples of isochronous curves.
This one is the isochrone we had on the previous

194
00:18:57,230 --> 00:19:00,109
diagram
which corresponds to the main sequence of

195
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:03,080
very young stars,
of the order of 10^6 years old.

196
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:10,909
Here is the isochrone for 10^9 years and another
one for 10^10 years,

197
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:14,850
namely 10 billion years, almost the age of
the Universe.

198
00:19:14,850 --> 00:19:17,889
Notice that on a 10^9 years old isochronous
line

199
00:19:17,889 --> 00:19:20,729
there is not any star at the top of the diagram
any more

200
00:19:20,729 --> 00:19:24,059
because all these stars have disappeared.
They had a large mass

201
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:28,769
and burned all their hydrogen. They were probably
more massive than 8 solar masses

202
00:19:28,769 --> 00:19:32,720
and have therefore all exploded. 10^9 years
afterwards, there is no

203
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,090
more star of this kind left on the colour-
magnitude diagram.

204
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,820
The remaining stars on this sequence have
smaller masses.

205
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,399
Here is the giant branch.
Some stars are still on the main sequence

206
00:19:42,399 --> 00:19:45,820
and are still burning their hydrogen
but the more massive ones have moved to the

207
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:49,570
giant branch.
If we wait a little more, there subsists only

208
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:55,379
stars with a very small mass on the main sequence.
Almost all stars have evolved toward the giant

209
00:19:55,379 --> 00:19:58,190
branch.
This way, just by looking at the location

210
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:02,830
of the knee,
one can know the age of the cluster, simply

211
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:08,320
because the age of the cluster
is the age of the stars leaving the main sequence.

212
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:14,179
Thanks to colour-magnitude diagrams and by
assuming that the sequences

213
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:17,759
we observe here come from a star population
of the same age,

214
00:20:17,759 --> 00:20:25,210
one can date the age of star clusters.
Either very young star clusters, 10^6 years

215
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,549
here
or star clusters that can have ages of the

216
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:34,409
order of the age of the Universe.
To summarize, stars form from

217
00:20:34,409 --> 00:20:39,970
the fragmenting of a gas and dust cloud.
They collapse

218
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:43,919
and this collapse warms up the centre of the
protostar

219
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:48,730
up to the point of starting the reactions
of nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium.

220
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:52,690
They spend most of their life burning hydrogen
into helium.

221
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:56,210
At this stage, they are located on the main
sequence we talked about

222
00:20:56,210 --> 00:21:01,330
several times, which is a mass sequence
with the most massive stars at the top

223
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:06,470
and the least massive stars at the bottom.
Once the hydrogen has been consumed, the equilibrium

224
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:10,539
between the
gas and radiative pressure outwards and gravity

225
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:13,340
in the opposite direction
is broken.

226
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:20,429
The core of the star tends to collapse
while the outer layers expand

227
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:26,099
and the star becomes therefore a giant star.
At this stage, it undergoes a succesive series

228
00:21:26,099 --> 00:21:29,289
of contractions
and ignitions of nuclear reactions

229
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:35,690
that each produces heavier and heavier elements.
If the star is beyond 8 solar masses, it explodes

230
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:40,049
in a supernova, a remain of which we see here
in the background.

231
00:21:40,049 --> 00:21:45,429
If the star is below 8 solar masses
such as our Sun with one solar mass,

232
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:49,270
it produces a nebula such as the nebula Messier
57

233
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:52,529
that we have already seen in the first chapter,
at the center of which

234
00:21:52,529 --> 00:21:57,509
rests a white dwarf.
Finally, stars with very low masses, less

235
00:21:57,509 --> 00:22:03,090
than 0.08 solar masses,
remain as red dwarves

236
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:06,320
or brown dwarves at the bottom of the colour-magnitude
diagram

237
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,730
and they will keep shining for billions of
years.
