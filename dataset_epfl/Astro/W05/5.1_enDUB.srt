1
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,769
In the next three videos
we will take interest in stellar formation

2
00:00:09,769 --> 00:00:12,190
and evolution.
In this first video

3
00:00:12,190 --> 00:00:15,719
we will see under which conditions a cloud
of gas and dust

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:19,260
can start its collapse until eventually forming
a star.

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,230
As we see here, stars form in groups
from a gas cloud which fragments

6
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:28,440
due to local inhomogeneities
and the resulting pieces if they are over

7
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:32,160
a certain mass
or over a critical radius, known respectively

8
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,460
as Jeans' mass
and Jeans' length.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,620
These pieces contract and warm up
up to the point where nuclear reactions

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:42,920
of hydrogen fusion start
and give birth to a star.

11
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:47,140
As we said, stars form from
fragments of a nebula.

12
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:52,440
We draw here a nebula fragment.
This fragment, if it is over a specific mass

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,730
or a specific radius
will collapse and as such become smaller and

14
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:04,750
smaller, and denser.
We will see that it implies that the fragment

15
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:09,250
will warm up.
Let us consider a nebula with a given radius

16
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:15,569
R
and as usual a given density,

17
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:22,889
a total mass and a total number of particles
composing the nebula : atoms and molecules.

18
00:01:22,889 --> 00:01:30,479
The nebula fragment is isolated
and we can then use the Virial theorem

19
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,729
which tells that, averaged in time,
the kinetic energy is minus one half of the

20
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:43,119
potential energy.
We can express the kinetic energy

21
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,259
as a function of temperature : 1/2 k T by
degree of freedom.

22
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:54,489
A 3 dimensional space means 3 degrees of freedom
and N particles leads to N degrees of freedom,

23
00:01:54,489 --> 00:02:01,399
times k the Boltzmann constant and T the temperature.
If we now assume our nebula fragment

24
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,630
to be more or less spherical in shape,
we can compute the potential energy like we

25
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:10,099
did in a previous video :
3 G M² (M being the total mass) over the

26
00:02:10,099 --> 00:02:14,519
radius of the nebula
if it can be approximated to be spherical

27
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:21,209
in shape.
Both quantities are equal by the Virial theorem

28
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:37,540
and we have then : GM²/R = 3 N k T.
As we have seen with the Virial theorem

29
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:43,230
and in particular with the simulation shown
in the video 1.4 on the Virial theorem,

30
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,540
If there is a lack of kinetic energy relative
to the potential energy,

31
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:59,900
the gas cloud in this case will start to collapse.
Let us take the aforementioned equation.

32
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:09,909
We have 3 N k T < 3/5 GM²/R.
By 

33
00:03:09,909 --> 00:03:15,680
rearranging the terms, we have
k T smaller than G m averaged that we introduced

34
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:28,500
in previous videos, over R times M.
With m averaged being the mean mass : M over

35
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:35,129
the number of particles.
If we now also assume that M = 4/3 π R³

36
00:03:35,129 --> 00:03:42,670
times the density,
supposing that the density does not depend

37
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,739
on the radius
and that it is therefore constant everywhere

38
00:03:45,739 --> 00:03:49,379
in the cloud,
we can then rewrite this inequality in another

39
00:03:49,379 --> 00:03:55,450
form.
R goes from the denominator to the numerator

40
00:03:55,450 --> 00:04:06,079
since we invert the inequality
R > square root of (15 k T) / (4 π G m ϱ).

41
00:04:06,079 --> 00:04:16,160
The mean mass can be expressed
as a function of the mean molecular mass we

42
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,799
previously talked about
times the atomic mass unit.

43
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,680
If there is a lack of kinetic energy
to support the shape of the cloud

44
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:30,120
then it will collapse
and the inequality we wrote here

45
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:36,810
comes to defining a critical radius
which is the minimum radius

46
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:43,389
a cloud of a constant density can have before
collapsing.

47
00:04:43,389 --> 00:04:47,400
The radius we juste defined
is called Jeans' length

48
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,560
named for the astronomer who first introduced
it.

49
00:04:50,560 --> 00:05:03,750
It is the square root of (15 k T) / (4 π
G m ϱ).

50
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:10,069
This length is the minimal radius from which
the gas cloud collapses

51
00:05:10,069 --> 00:05:26,250
at a constant density.
If R is bigger than Jeans' length,

52
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:36,949
then we have a collapse.
A star can potentially form from such a collapse.

53
00:05:36,949 --> 00:05:39,520
There is some mass contained within Jeans'
length

54
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:51,330
which allows us to define Jeans' mass,
the mass inside Jeans' length.

55
00:05:51,330 --> 00:06:06,419
It is the limit mass before the collapse
of a cloud of a given radius, Jeans' length.

56
00:06:06,419 --> 00:06:09,530
We have a collapsing cloud
and we now seek to know

57
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:14,909
the time taken for the cloud to collapse.
This is called the free-fall time.

58
00:06:14,909 --> 00:06:21,650
How much time does it take for each point
of a roughly spherical cloud

59
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,810
to collapse into a single point, say at the
centre of the cloud.

60
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,360
We have a cloud with a radius R just like
previously

61
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:33,210
and we have a particle leaving from the edge
of the cloud

62
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:42,180
and going to the centre of the cloud.
We can consider a straight line

63
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:49,470
to actually be an ellipse of infinite eccentricity.
I draw here another ellipse with a smaller

64
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:55,419
eccentricity
and again another one with another eccentricity.

65
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:59,289
You recall Kepler's laws
- we already see the drawing here -

66
00:06:59,289 --> 00:07:03,919
which said that the orbital period is independent
from the eccentricity.

67
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:09,419
All trajectories I am drawing here,
if for example a particle leaves this point

68
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:12,229
and follows this path
until reaching the centre,

69
00:07:12,229 --> 00:07:17,200
it will take the same time as
if it took this other path here.

70
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:24,659
We thus consider that we have a particle here
on an extremely eccentric orbit

71
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:30,580
with a radius of R/2.
The free-fall time is therefore

72
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,580
the time taken to go from this point to the
centre

73
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:40,099
which corresponds to half the orbital period.
The orbit has a radius R/2.

74
00:07:40,099 --> 00:07:46,919
The free-fall time is P, the period of the
orbits drawn here,

75
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:50,909
- P being independent of the eccentricity
which is what we're going to compute with

76
00:07:50,909 --> 00:07:54,580
Kepler's third law-
divided by 2. This period - according to Kepler's

77
00:07:54,580 --> 00:08:06,240
law -
is 4 π/G M²

78
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,139
and here is the a³ which is the cube of the
semi-major axis,

79
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:16,300
the orbital semi-major axis is R/2.
We put the total mass of the cloud in a point

80
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:30,180
here at the centre of the cloud.
If we rewrite the equation, we get this.

81
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:34,940
It is the period of the relevant orbit.
The free-fall time is equal to the period

82
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:40,570
/ 2.
Since the period is squared I have a square

83
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:51,400
root here.
The free-fall time is 3 π/ 32 G ϱ.

84
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,790
What we especially notice
is that the free-fall time only depends on

85
00:08:54,790 --> 00:09:02,810
the density ϱ.
Here are a few examples of free-fall times,

86
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:07,080
a few orders of magnitude.
We have here the density of some objects

87
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:12,300
including the Universe as a whole,
the density of which being 10^-27 kg/m³

88
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:17,020
and we have the corresponding free-fall times.
We see that if the whole Universe

89
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,650
collapsed without any resistance
it would take 10^11 years.

90
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:26,200
This is of course an order of magnitude.
A galaxy with a density of roughly 10^-21

91
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:28,810
kg/m³
would collapse

92
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:33,470
in roughly 100 million years.
Clouds in the interstellar medium

93
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:39,270
take tens of thousands of years
to a few million years to collapse.

94
00:09:39,270 --> 00:09:43,570
The solar system would take 1000 years
and a star such as the Sun with a density

95
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:49,330
of roughly 1.4 tons/m³
would collapse in half an hour.

96
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:57,420
Yet the Sun does not collapse in half an hour.
To understand this fact, let us have a look

97
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,270
at
the energy balance of the Sun.

98
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:06,280
If we look at the total energy,
its change is equal to the change of potential

99
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:13,640
energy
plus the change of kinetic energy.

100
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:20,900
This is equal to the energy loss rate,
namely the Sun's luminosity times a time unit.

101
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:24,040
For an isolated system we have the Virial
theorem which tells that

102
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:32,850
dU + 2 d K = 0.
We now have a system of two equations with

103
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:36,700
two unknowns
which is easy to solve.

104
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:51,750
We get that dU = - 2 L dT and dK = + L dT.
This means that the star radiating implies

105
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:57,720
a loss of potential energy.
The luminosity of the star creates a loss

106
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:05,420
of potential energy.
We also notice that half of the lost potential

107
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:16,000
energy
is gained, converted into kinetic energy.

108
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,230
If there is a gain of kinetic energy
it means that the star warms up.

109
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:24,670
If there is a warm up, there is photon emission
by black body or ionization

110
00:11:24,670 --> 00:11:28,550
and if there is photon emission
there is a radiative pressure exerted by the

111
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:31,770
photons
on the external layers of the collapsing stars.

112
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:37,160
This radiative pressure counteracts the gravitation
and prevents the star from collapsing

113
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:41,710
in a time of the order of
the free-fall time.

114
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,180
We can go some steps further
and estimate the lifetime of a star by saying

115
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:52,330
that
this lifetime is the time needed

116
00:11:52,330 --> 00:11:56,670
to shine half the potential energy
since this is what the star loses.

117
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:00,110
We have then half the potential energy, U
/ 2

118
00:12:00,110 --> 00:12:05,300
radiated at a rate corresponding to the luminosity
of the star.

119
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:11,440
In the case of a sphere, it is simply
3/5 divided by 2, or 3/10

120
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:16,690
times G M² the mass of the star
over R, this is so far the potential energy

121
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:21,790
of a sphere, divided by 2,
and the L we have here.

122
00:12:21,790 --> 00:12:29,330
This is called the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale.
It is the lifetime of the star if it radiated

123
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:35,640
half of the available potential energy.
This is of course only an order of magnitude.

124
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:39,480
If we make a numerical application
for one solar mass, we find that

125
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:42,960
the Kelvin-Helmholtz time scale
is around 10 million years.

126
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:47,340
The Sun is five billion years old
so the time scale is roughly 500 times too

127
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:50,850
small
in the case of the Sun, a star of one solar

128
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:54,360
mass.
There is therefore another energy source that

129
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:57,790
makes the stars shine.
We have seen in a simplified manner how the

130
00:12:57,790 --> 00:13:01,450
stars form and
how they take their energy from

131
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,610
the gravitational collapse on the one hand
and the nuclear reactions on the other hand.

132
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,200
As you have indeed understood,
death and birth of stars

133
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:13,660
are deeply linked.
Generations of stars follow one after the

134
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:16,010
other :
young stars are formed from the material,

135
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,370
the remains of dead stars.
It is within diffuse nebulae like the one

136
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:22,780
pictured,
that stellar remains and rising stars live

137
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:26,110
side by side .
In the upcoming videos, and in particular

138
00:13:26,110 --> 00:13:29,560
in the very next one,
we will see how stars evolve

139
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:32,860
once they started up the nuclear reactions
in their centre.

140
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:35,520
We will see what are
the observational methods

141
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:37,390
to study the many steps of their life.
