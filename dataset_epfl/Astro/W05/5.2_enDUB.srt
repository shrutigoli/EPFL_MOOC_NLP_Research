1
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:12,059
Once formed, the stars shine
thanks to the nuclear reactions in their core.

2
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:15,929
The energy produced is transported to the
surface, which in turns warms up

3
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:19,860
and reemits black body radiation.
We will see in what follows

4
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,449
how one can classify
the stars depending on their luminosity

5
00:00:23,449 --> 00:00:26,900
and on their colour, which is actually depending
on

6
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,550
the black body temperature.
This video describes the stellar spectral

7
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,469
classification
and introduces an essential tool for astrophysicists

8
00:00:35,469 --> 00:00:38,600
:
the Hertzprung-Russell diagram.

9
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,300
Let us now see how to classify the stars.
The main difference between stars is their

10
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:48,649
temperature.
This temperature determines the colour of

11
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:52,239
the stars.
The stellar classification is therefore a

12
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:56,579
spectral classification
mainly linked to the surface colour,

13
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:03,940
the surface temperature of stars.
Here are all known kinds of stars.

14
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:10,470
There are seven different spectral types,
each with its temperature.

15
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:19,780
Here is for example an extremely blue star
with a black body radiation at 40'000 Kelvin

16
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:23,240
so an extremely hot star,
among the hottest that exist.

17
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:26,640
As such it has a much higher flux
in the blue part of the spectrum

18
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,170
- here is the blue, and here is the red.
Conversely, if we take a cold star such as

19
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:41,740
this one
with a black body temperature of more or less

20
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:46,740
3000 Kelvin,
the spectrum is much redder.

21
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,380
There is more flux on the red than on the
blue side of the spectrum.

22
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,340
Between the two we have stars similar to the
Sun.

23
00:01:55,340 --> 00:02:00,360
The Sun, with a temperature of about 5780
K, is a star

24
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:10,420
with a mainly yellow spectrum.
To measure the colour of stars we use colour

25
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:15,330
indices.
We usually use the B and V filters in the

26
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,330
optical domain
and we then measure the slope of the spectrum

27
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:25,720
as a function of the colour index.
Each time the temperature of a star changes

28
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:30,250
we have a change in the slope of the spectrum
and also several spectral lines such as these

29
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,320
ones.
We see the hydrogen spectral lines for example

30
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,500
as well as
molecular bands appearing in colder stars.

31
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,090
Depending on the star's temperature
its colour changes and the absorption

32
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,250
or emission lines in its spectrum
also change.

33
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:47,360
How do we measure the slope of the spectrum?
We have already seen this.

34
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,470
I take the star with a blue spectrum as an
example.

35
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,790
If I measure the flux at the centre of the
B filter bandwidth

36
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:59,370
and the flux at the centre of the V filter
bandwidth,

37
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:08,600
I can measure the slope of this spectrum thanks
to these two values.

38
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:12,080
We have then some slope, which is blue since
there is more flux

39
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:18,980
in the blue than in the red domain.
If I now take the green star on this figure,

40
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:25,730
I have a first measure in the B filter and
a second one in the V filter

41
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:30,170
and I get then a much more horizontal spectrum
slope.

42
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:35,060
The star is thus less blue, simply because
its temperature

43
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:42,840
is lower than for the previous star.
The B - V index is therefore

44
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,000
an indicator of the spectral type
and it is this index that will appear later

45
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:57,810
in the colour magnitude diagram.
If B - V is large then we have a red star

46
00:03:57,810 --> 00:04:07,540
and if B - V is small we have a rather blue
star.

47
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:11,440
The spectral classification is based as the
name suggests

48
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:16,180
on spectra.
There are seven spectral classes

49
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:29,460
at the basis of the Harvard classification.
In the Harvard system, we have spectral types

50
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:44,400
named as : O, B, A, F, G, K and M.
We have seven letters to indicate seven spectral

51
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:49,220
types.
From one side of the scale to the other,

52
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:55,430
the temperature decreases.
We typically go from 40'000 degrees here down

53
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:57,530
to
3 000 Kelvin here.

54
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,220
Here are a few examples of spectral types
:

55
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:24,160
O, B, and A, the first three spectral types
corresponding to the following temperatures.

56
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,360
This is the range in temperatures.
Each spectral type has different features.

57
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:34,120
In each case we have hydrogen here
but depending on the temperature the spectral

58
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:37,919
lines
are stronger or weaker.

59
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,370
In very hot stars we also have
helium lines, and here as well.

60
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,190
And here there isn't helium anymore.
If the star is extremely hot we can also see

61
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:51,240
lines
of species with a much higher ionization energy

62
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:57,800
such as carbon or oxygen.
The depth at which the lines form depends

63
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,340
on two things :
the rate, the number of ionising photons emitted

64
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,330
by the star
and the recombination rate, for example in

65
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:08,330
the case of hydrogen
the recombination of protons and electrons.

66
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:12,070
In the case of an extremely hot star, the
rate of

67
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:18,770
emitted photons, the flux of ionizing photons
is much higher than the proton-electron recombination

68
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:20,480
rate
per unit of time.

69
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,540
This means that contrarily to what one may
think, the hydrogen spectral lines

70
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:30,080
are formed less deep than for a colder star
where there a much more atoms so more electron-proton

71
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,810
pairs
able to reabsorb light and create the hydrogen

72
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:40,479
spectral lines.
Each spectral type has of course its own temperature.

73
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,360
When we go toward the red domain, toward colder
temperatures,

74
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,470
the black body peak
is translated toward the red domain.

75
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,090
Here the peak is at 4000 angstrom, here it
is shorter than 4000 angstrom

76
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:55,590
and finally the peak here is far outside of
the diagram.

77
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:01,080
Stars become therefore redder and redder
when going toward the M spectral type.

78
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,840
We have here O, B and A stars.
Let us now consider the other spectral types,

79
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:14,229
F, G, K and M.
In this case the temperatures are in the following

80
00:07:14,229 --> 00:07:35,180
range.
As said before, there are seven spectral classes

81
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:53,979
and here are the four last ones.
O, B, A, F, G, K and M.

82
00:07:53,979 --> 00:07:56,639
We see the black body peak moving toward the
red domain

83
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,850
as temperature decreases.
We also witness other features.

84
00:07:59,850 --> 00:08:05,889
For example there are here some metallic lines
such as calcium lines.

85
00:08:05,889 --> 00:08:09,901
They also appear here.
The Sun is by the way a star in the temperature

86
00:08:09,901 --> 00:08:15,300
range
of 5 000 - 6 000 Kelvin, therefore a G star

87
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:19,630
with 5780 Kelvin.
As the surface temperature of the star gets

88
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:28,889
colder,
we notice molecular bands.

89
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:35,740
Molecules are therefore broken at high temperatures.
When the temperature of the star decreases,

90
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,639
molecules will absorb light and produce wide
lines.

91
00:08:40,639 --> 00:08:45,420
They are actually composed of a great number
of very narrow lines which we cannot

92
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:48,619
distinguish due to the limited instrumental
resolution.

93
00:08:48,619 --> 00:08:53,420
We see here several bunches, each made of
a large number of molecular lines.

94
00:08:53,420 --> 00:09:00,600
Hence stars with cold temperature
feature spectral lines typical of molecules.

95
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:07,589
There are seven spectral classes, and there
are also ten subclasses.

96
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:19,429
We have ten divisions between two letters,
ranging from 0 to 9.

97
00:09:19,429 --> 00:09:30,490
In addition there are seven luminosity classes
reflecting essentially the radius of the stars.

98
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:40,810
There are the Ia and Ib luminosities, II,
III, up to VI (roman numerals).

99
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:56,510
We will talk about their meaning later.
For example, the Sun is a G2 V star.

100
00:09:56,510 --> 00:10:03,209
G for the temperature
and 2 to split the temperature interval

101
00:10:03,209 --> 00:10:07,800
into ten finer intervals. The Sun is thus
at 5780 K.

102
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:14,160
V (roman numeral) is the luminosity class
of the Sun, which corresponds

103
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:19,489
to the class of 80% of stars.
We have just seen that stars can be classified

104
00:10:19,489 --> 00:10:24,720
in terms of luminosity and temperature,
the latter being at the origin of their colour.

105
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:29,610
It is as such logical to build a diagram
showing both quantities and corresponding

106
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:33,019
stars.
We are going to do this for the Omega centauri

107
00:10:33,019 --> 00:10:36,569
globular cluster.
We first sort the stars by colour, moving

108
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:42,579
blue stars to the left side
and red stars to the right side of the diagram.

109
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:45,260
This actually corresponds to sorting them
by temperature,

110
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:49,819
with blue hot stars to the left
and red cold ones to the right.

111
00:10:49,819 --> 00:10:54,439
It simply illustrates Wien's displacement
law

112
00:10:54,439 --> 00:10:58,589
for a black body spectrum.
We now sort them by luminosity and put

113
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:06,360
the faint stars, with a high magnitude,
at the bottom of the diagram, and bright stars

114
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,350
with small or even negative magnitudes for
the brightest

115
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:14,500
at the top of the diagram.
The resulting diagram is called the Hertzsprung

116
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,899
- Russell diagram,
or HR diagram.

117
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:23,869
As you notice, stars are not randomly distributed
across the diagram but instead follow a well

118
00:11:23,869 --> 00:11:26,860
defined sequence
which we will now see.

119
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,589
What kind of stars are on the diagram, where
are they located

120
00:11:29,589 --> 00:11:34,709
and what are their physical parameters ?
Here is a colour-magnitude diagram, a Hertzsprung

121
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:41,959
- Russell diagram
for 22 000 stars of our Milky Way.

122
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:47,040
We have four axes on this diagram.
We see at the top the spectral classes, O

123
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:53,269
B A F G K and M, ranging from
the hottest temperatures, around 30 - 40 000

124
00:11:53,269 --> 00:11:57,860
Kelvin
to the lowest, about 3 000 Kelvin.

125
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:02,350
We will draw the different axes.
We have at the bottom an axis representing

126
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:06,680
the colour, B-V for example
with the lowest values to the left and the

127
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,870
highest to the right.
Red colours are on this side and blue ones

128
00:12:09,870 --> 00:12:15,110
are here.
A blue colour means a high black body temperature.

129
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,970
Therefore the top axis showing the temperature
varies in the opposite direction to the bottom

130
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:25,509
axis.
We have here temperature

131
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:34,360
increasing in this direction.
The luminosity axis increases in this direction.

132
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:41,299
Here is the luminosity of stars in units of
solar luminosity.

133
00:12:41,299 --> 00:12:46,119
In the opposite side we have the axis of absolute
magnitudes

134
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:51,709
which increases downwards.
The absolute magnitude is

135
00:12:51,709 --> 00:12:56,639
the apparent magnitude a star would have
if it was located at a distance of ten parsecs.

136
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:07,610
The diagram shows several classes of luminosity.
We have here very big and bright stars,

137
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:13,220
hypergiant and supergiant stars.
Here are the the bright giants, the giants

138
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:18,779
and the subgiants.
80% of stars are actually on this sequence

139
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:23,449
called
the main sequence. Stars burn their hydrogen

140
00:13:23,449 --> 00:13:28,329
into helium
during all their life on this sequence.

141
00:13:28,329 --> 00:13:33,360
It is hence a mass sequence called the main
sequence.

142
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:42,239
We have at last the sequence of dwarves.
White dwarves are located in this area

143
00:13:42,239 --> 00:13:47,689
of the colour-magnitude diagram.
We have 22 000 stars of the Milky Way.

144
00:13:47,689 --> 00:13:52,939
80% of stars are located here
and the stars which became giants

145
00:13:52,939 --> 00:14:01,149
are in this area of the colour-magnitude diagram.
We can also draw iso-radius contours on the

146
00:14:01,149 --> 00:14:04,709
diagram.
We already said that the higher we are on

147
00:14:04,709 --> 00:14:09,269
the diagram, the bigger the stars.
To understand this, remember that the luminosity

148
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:14,319
of a star
depends on its surface.

149
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:18,189
R is the radius of the star, and it is multiplied
by σ T^4.

150
00:14:18,189 --> 00:14:26,769
This can be rewritten in terms of solar units.
We have L over the solar luminosity

151
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:32,230
and here remains the squared ratio of R over
the solar radius

152
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:36,459
since both 4π and σ vanished. The same holds
for the temperature

153
00:14:36,459 --> 00:14:40,069
if one divides by the corresponding solar
quantity.

154
00:14:40,069 --> 00:14:45,179
We have such a relation
that we can turn into a logarithmic one.

155
00:14:45,179 --> 00:14:52,670
I do not rewrite each time the solar units.
We obtain that the logarithm of L is twice

156
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:59,679
the logarithm of R
plus four times the logarithm of the temperature

157
00:14:59,679 --> 00:15:02,939
where of course everything is written in solar
units :

158
00:15:02,939 --> 00:15:06,869
solar luminosities, solar radii and solar
temperatures.

159
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:12,679
If R is constant we have the equation of a
straight line

160
00:15:12,679 --> 00:15:17,769
in a log-log scale : a function which behaves
like y = ax+b

161
00:15:17,769 --> 00:15:29,519
where y is the logarithm of L,
b is twice the logarithm of R, which stays

162
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,299
constant
since R has a fixed value

163
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:41,279
and here is x, with the constant a in front.
This is simply the equation of a straight

164
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,149
line in the HR diagram,
in the colour-magnitude diagram.

165
00:15:45,149 --> 00:15:52,600
This straight line is drawn here
and here is the position of the Sun.

166
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:58,970
Now let us change the value of the radius.
Here we have one solar radius, one solar luminosity

167
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:02,549
and one solar temperature
When R changes, the value of the parameter

168
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:06,660
b changes as well,
therefore the y-intercept point of this line

169
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,319
changes.
We are translating our line towards the top

170
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:13,449
or the bottom of the diagram.
By the way, since we are talking about stellar

171
00:16:13,449 --> 00:16:21,850
radius, in the main sequence
along this straight line,

172
00:16:21,850 --> 00:16:25,420
typical radii range between 0.1 solar radii
up to

173
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:34,019
15 solar radii.
It is not the same thing for giant or hypergiant

174
00:16:34,019 --> 00:16:36,529
stars.
If we consider the whole range of radii for

175
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:43,529
all stars,
then the range is obviously much wider and

176
00:16:43,529 --> 00:16:48,410
we can reach
up to 1000 solar radii

177
00:16:48,410 --> 00:16:51,471
for hypergiant stars. On the other hand, dwarf
stars

178
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:59,129
can have 1/100th of the solar radius.
The range of radii, therefore, spans five

179
00:16:59,129 --> 00:17:04,220
orders of magnitude
from one extreme radius to the other extreme.

180
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:09,130
A note on the effect of interstellar absorption
in a colour-magnitude diagram :

181
00:17:09,130 --> 00:17:13,880
Remember that the observed magnitude of an
object

182
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,620
is the intrinsic magnitude
plus some absorption,

183
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:23,920
the positive sign is because, after absorption,
a star appears less bright

184
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,660
than its real magnitude, so the magnitude
will be larger

185
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:31,580
and for that reason we add a positive quantity.
We saw that this absorption coefficient depends

186
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:34,450
on the colour :
the absorption does not only cause an increase

187
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,530
in magnitude
but also makes the stars appear redder, as

188
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:46,030
we saw
in the chapter on the interstellar medium.

189
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:50,960
If we take the example of this diagram
with a stellar population corresponding to

190
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:55,651
a star cluster
- this diagram shows the Milky Way, but let

191
00:17:55,651 --> 00:17:59,070
us suppose
that we observe a homogeneous stellar population,

192
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,900
a star cluster -
that we observe from Earth

193
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:18,050
with dust clouds in-between,
then the diagram will be shifted downwards.

194
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:21,750
The sequence is shifted downwards but also
reddens, which means

195
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:31,820
that we have a reddening vector in the direction
of increasing B-V.

196
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:42,140
In conclusion, the diagram is shifted
along a diagonal reddening vector.

197
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,020
We therefore have to be cautious on the conclusions
of the

198
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:48,900
study of a stellar population
when we obtain such a colour-magnitude or

199
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,990
HR diagram
because it can be affected by reddening on

200
00:18:51,990 --> 00:18:54,051
the line of sight
of the star we are observing.

201
00:18:54,051 --> 00:19:00,140
A last word on the radius of stars.
We said that we can draw isoradius straight

202
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:03,440
lines
in the colour-magnitude diagram.

203
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:09,130
We will see here that the radius cannot be
directly measured

204
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:11,830
To understand this, we can look at the flux
received on Earth

205
00:19:11,830 --> 00:19:26,420
from a star at a distance d
and compute this flux as a function of the

206
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:30,050
flux on the surface
of the star with a radius r, the luminous

207
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:40,920
flux.
The two fluxes relate as follow :

208
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:47,490
the observed flux is the intrinsic flux times
the surface of the star

209
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:59,500
times 1 over a sphere of radius d.
We then deduce that f = F (R/d)².

210
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:11,820
R/d is simply the angular radius of the star,
the subtended radius of

211
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:20,000
the star at some distance.
We have here the radius of the star, the angle

212
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:28,000
α and the distance d.
Considering a hypergiant star at a distance

213
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:38,160
of 200 parsec,
a very close star

214
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:49,440
with a radius of 1000 solar radii,
we get that α is roughly equal to 0.02 arcsecond.

215
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:55,610
0.02 arcsecond is approximately half the size
of the smallest visible detail by current

216
00:20:55,610 --> 00:21:00,160
telescopes.
It is therefore totally impossible to observe

217
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:06,560
the surface of another star than the Sun.
The Sun is the only star on which we see surface

218
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:12,230
features.
The colour-magnitude diagram is an incomparably

219
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,040
precious tool
to characterize stellar populations

220
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:17,810
from the simple measurement of colour and
luminosity,

221
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:22,380
the colour being linked to the temperature.
Be attentive however that the diagram is valid

222
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,440
only if
all the objects in it are at the same distance

223
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,370
from us, in other words if we show
the diagram in terms of luminosity or in terms

224
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:34,020
of absolute magnitudes,
namely the magnitude brought to an arbitrary

225
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:38,150
distance of ten parsec.
In the next video we will see how stars move

226
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:42,370
in the diagram in the course of their life.
It is a whole domain of astrophysics :

227
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:44,030
the study of stellar evolution.
