1
00:00:05,837 --> 00:00:07,712
Once formed,
the stars shine

2
00:00:07,712 --> 00:00:09,898
thanks to the nuclear
reactions in their core.

3
00:00:10,069 --> 00:00:13,598
The energy produced is transported
to the surface, which in turns warms up

4
00:00:13,734 --> 00:00:16,205
and reemits black body radiation.

5
00:00:16,785 --> 00:00:18,276
We will see in what follows

6
00:00:18,276 --> 00:00:19,227
how one can classify

7
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:21,856
the stars depending
on their luminosity

8
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:25,456
and on their colour, which is
actually depending on

9
00:00:25,456 --> 00:00:26,675
the black body temperature.

10
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:30,763
This video describes the
stellar spectral classification

11
00:00:30,763 --> 00:00:33,521
and introduces an essential
tool for astrophysicists :

12
00:00:33,521 --> 00:00:35,366
the Hertzprung-Russell diagram. 

13
00:00:36,865 --> 00:00:39,081
Let us now see how
to classify the stars.

14
00:00:39,086 --> 00:00:44,398
The main difference between
stars is their temperature.

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,696
This temperature determines
the colour of the stars.

16
00:00:50,062 --> 00:00:53,855
The stellar classification is
therefore a spectral classification

17
00:00:53,855 --> 00:00:57,144
mainly linked to the surface colour,

18
00:00:57,144 --> 00:01:00,243
the surface temperature of stars.

19
00:01:00,243 --> 00:01:03,892
Here are all known
kinds of stars.

20
00:01:03,894 --> 00:01:10,356
There are seven different spectral
types, each with its temperature.

21
00:01:10,389 --> 00:01:15,049
Here is for example an
extremely blue star

22
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:19,845
with a black body radiation
at 40'000 Kelvin

23
00:01:19,847 --> 00:01:21,957
so an extremely hot star,

24
00:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,452
among the hottest that exist.

25
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:25,463
As such it has a much higher flux

26
00:01:25,463 --> 00:01:26,954
in the blue part of the spectrum

27
00:01:26,954 --> 00:01:29,166
- here is the blue, and here is the red.

28
00:01:31,719 --> 00:01:36,941
Conversely, if we take
a cold star such as this one

29
00:01:39,338 --> 00:01:43,519
with a black body temperature
of more or less 3000 Kelvin,

30
00:01:43,535 --> 00:01:46,676
the spectrum is
much redder.

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,190
There is more flux on the red
than on the blue side of the spectrum.

32
00:01:51,084 --> 00:01:55,310
Between the two we have 
stars similar to the Sun.

33
00:01:55,310 --> 00:02:04,595
The Sun, with a temperature of
about 5780 K, is a star

34
00:02:04,595 --> 00:02:06,733
with a mainly yellow spectrum.

35
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:12,868
To measure the colour of stars
we use colour indices.

36
00:02:12,868 --> 00:02:16,368
We usually use the B and V
filters in the optical domain

37
00:02:16,377 --> 00:02:23,281
and we then measure the slope of the
spectrum as a function of the colour index.

38
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:26,434
Each time the temperature
of a star changes

39
00:02:26,434 --> 00:02:28,388
we have a change
in the slope of the spectrum

40
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:30,613
and also several spectral
lines such as these ones.

41
00:02:30,613 --> 00:02:32,657
We see the hydrogen spectral
lines for example as well as

42
00:02:32,657 --> 00:02:35,781
molecular bands appearing
in colder stars.

43
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,728
Depending on the star's temperature

44
00:02:37,728 --> 00:02:39,656
its colour changes
and the absorption

45
00:02:39,656 --> 00:02:41,775
or emission lines in its spectrum

46
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:43,797
also change.

47
00:02:44,053 --> 00:02:45,818
How do we measure the slope of the spectrum?

48
00:02:45,834 --> 00:02:47,537
We have already seen this.

49
00:02:47,537 --> 00:02:51,392
I take the star with a blue
spectrum as an example.

50
00:02:51,392 --> 00:02:55,708
If I measure the flux at the centre
of the B filter bandwidth

51
00:02:55,719 --> 00:03:01,258
and the flux at the centre
of the V filter bandwidth,

52
00:03:01,258 --> 00:03:08,252
I can measure the slope of this
spectrum thanks to these two values.

53
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:12,116
We have then some slope, which
is blue since there is more flux

54
00:03:12,116 --> 00:03:14,741
in the blue than in the red domain.

55
00:03:14,741 --> 00:03:20,612
If I now take the green star
on this figure,

56
00:03:21,354 --> 00:03:25,655
I have a first measure in the B filter
and a second one in the V filter

57
00:03:25,655 --> 00:03:29,522
and I get then a much more
horizontal spectrum slope.

58
00:03:30,138 --> 00:03:35,115
The star is thus less blue, simply
because its temperature

59
00:03:35,115 --> 00:03:37,669
is lower than for the previous star.

60
00:03:37,687 --> 00:03:42,763
The B - V index is therefore

61
00:03:42,763 --> 00:03:44,727
an indicator of the spectral type

62
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:47,586
and it is this index that will appear later
in the colour magnitude diagram.

63
00:03:48,502 --> 00:03:55,692
If B - V is large then we have a red star

64
00:03:57,682 --> 00:04:05,104
and if B - V is small
we have a rather blue star.

65
00:04:07,499 --> 00:04:11,489
The spectral classification is
based as the name suggests

66
00:04:11,489 --> 00:04:12,650
on spectra.

67
00:04:12,658 --> 00:04:14,502
There are seven spectral classes

68
00:04:16,114 --> 00:04:18,698
at the basis of
the Harvard classification.

69
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:25,626
In the Harvard system,
we have spectral types

70
00:04:29,292 --> 00:04:40,582
named as :
O, B, A, F, G, K and M.

71
00:04:41,695 --> 00:04:44,576
We have seven letters 
to indicate seven spectral types.

72
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:49,176
From one side of the scale
to the other,

73
00:04:49,189 --> 00:04:51,617
the temperature decreases.

74
00:04:53,771 --> 00:04:56,390
We typically go from 40'000 degrees
here down to 

75
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:58,046
3 000 Kelvin here.

76
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:00,213
Here are a few examples
of spectral types :

77
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:05,824
O, B, and A, the first three
spectral types

78
00:05:05,824 --> 00:05:08,578
corresponding to the 
following temperatures.

79
00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:25,653
This is the range in temperatures.

80
00:05:25,653 --> 00:05:29,109
Each spectral type has
different features.

81
00:05:29,109 --> 00:05:32,225
In each case we have
hydrogen here

82
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:35,015
but depending on the temperature
the spectral lines

83
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:37,857
are stronger or weaker.

84
00:05:37,857 --> 00:05:41,108
In very hot stars
we also have

85
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,234
helium lines, and here as well.

86
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:45,776
And here there isn't helium anymore.

87
00:05:45,776 --> 00:05:49,462
If the star is extremely hot
we can also see lines

88
00:05:49,462 --> 00:05:51,638
of species with a much higher ionization energy

89
00:05:51,638 --> 00:05:55,742
such as carbon or oxygen.

90
00:05:55,742 --> 00:05:58,527
The depth at which the lines form 
depends on two things :

91
00:05:58,527 --> 00:06:02,518
the rate, the number of ionising
photons emitted by the star

92
00:06:02,518 --> 00:06:05,140
and the recombination rate,
for example in the case of hydrogen

93
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,270
the recombination of
protons and electrons.

94
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,904
In the case of an extremely
hot star, the rate of

95
00:06:11,904 --> 00:06:15,659
emitted photons, the
flux of ionizing photons

96
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:18,647
is much higher than the
proton-electron recombination rate

97
00:06:18,647 --> 00:06:20,166
per unit of time.

98
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,026
This means that contrarily to what one
may think, the hydrogen spectral lines

99
00:06:23,026 --> 00:06:25,628
are formed less deep than for 
a colder star

100
00:06:25,628 --> 00:06:32,241
where there a much more atoms
so more electron-proton pairs

101
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:35,975
able to reabsorb light and create
the hydrogen spectral lines.

102
00:06:37,419 --> 00:06:40,557
Each spectral type has of
course its own temperature.

103
00:06:40,559 --> 00:06:42,839
When we go toward the red domain,
toward colder temperatures,

104
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:45,016
the black body peak

105
00:06:45,016 --> 00:06:47,410
is translated toward
the red domain.

106
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,878
Here the peak is at 4000 angstrom,
here it is shorter than 4000 angstrom

107
00:06:49,878 --> 00:06:53,566
and finally the peak here is
far outside of the diagram. 

108
00:06:53,566 --> 00:06:56,822
Stars become therefore 
redder and redder

109
00:06:56,822 --> 00:07:01,011
when going toward the
M spectral type.

110
00:07:01,015 --> 00:07:03,424
We have here O, B and A stars.

111
00:07:03,444 --> 00:07:06,510
Let us now consider
the other spectral types,

112
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:11,786
F, G, K and M.

113
00:07:11,786 --> 00:07:14,740
In this case the temperatures
are in the following range.

114
00:07:29,065 --> 00:07:34,039
As said before, there
are seven spectral classes

115
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:39,484
and here are the four last ones.

116
00:07:39,484 --> 00:07:51,134
O, B, A, F, G, K and M.

117
00:07:53,955 --> 00:07:56,514
We see the black body peak
moving toward the red domain

118
00:07:56,514 --> 00:07:58,165
as temperature decreases.

119
00:07:58,165 --> 00:07:59,851
We also witness other features.

120
00:07:59,851 --> 00:08:03,368
For example there are here
some metallic lines

121
00:08:03,368 --> 00:08:05,859
such as calcium lines.

122
00:08:05,859 --> 00:08:07,455
They also appear here.

123
00:08:07,455 --> 00:08:11,774
The Sun is by the way
a star in the temperature range

124
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:15,397
of 5 000 - 6 000 Kelvin, 
therefore a G star

125
00:08:15,397 --> 00:08:18,531
with 5780 Kelvin.

126
00:08:18,536 --> 00:08:22,183
As the surface temperature
of the star gets colder,

127
00:08:22,183 --> 00:08:26,499
we notice molecular bands.

128
00:08:28,383 --> 00:08:32,820
Molecules are therefore broken
at high temperatures.

129
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,103
When the temperature
of the star decreases,

130
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:40,608
molecules will absorb light
and produce wide lines.

131
00:08:40,608 --> 00:08:45,469
They are actually composed of a great number
of very narrow lines which we cannot

132
00:08:45,469 --> 00:08:48,564
distinguish due to the limited
instrumental resolution.

133
00:08:48,564 --> 00:08:52,728
We see here several bunches, each made
of a large number of molecular lines.

134
00:08:53,242 --> 00:08:55,858
Hence stars with cold temperature

135
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:59,356
feature spectral lines
typical of molecules.

136
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:05,728
There are seven spectral classes,
and there are also ten subclasses.

137
00:09:07,532 --> 00:09:10,656
We have ten divisions
between two letters,

138
00:09:13,176 --> 00:09:17,709
ranging from 0 to 9.

139
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:25,986
In addition there are
seven luminosity classes

140
00:09:27,702 --> 00:09:30,789
reflecting essentially the radius of the stars.

141
00:09:31,224 --> 00:09:40,775
There are the Ia and Ib luminosities, II, III,
up to VI (roman numerals).

142
00:09:40,775 --> 00:09:44,826
We will talk about their meaning later.

143
00:09:46,866 --> 00:09:56,548
For example, the Sun is
a G2 V star.

144
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:58,461
G for the temperature

145
00:09:58,461 --> 00:10:03,106
and 2 to split the 
temperature interval

146
00:10:03,106 --> 00:10:09,558
into ten finer intervals. The Sun is
thus at 5780 K.

147
00:10:09,558 --> 00:10:14,258
V (roman numeral) is the luminosity
class of the Sun, which corresponds

148
00:10:14,258 --> 00:10:15,969
to the class of 80% of stars.

149
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,143
We have just seen that stars
can be classified

150
00:10:19,143 --> 00:10:21,748
in terms of luminosity
and temperature,

151
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:24,625
the latter being at
the origin of their colour.

152
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,103
It is as such logical to
build a diagram

153
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:30,074
showing both quantities
and corresponding stars.

154
00:10:30,074 --> 00:10:32,914
We are going to do this
for the Omega centauri

155
00:10:32,914 --> 00:10:34,652
globular cluster.

156
00:10:34,652 --> 00:10:39,167
We first sort the stars by colour,
moving blue stars to the left side

157
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:42,502
and red stars to the right side
of the diagram.

158
00:10:42,502 --> 00:10:45,048
This actually corresponds
to sorting them by temperature,

159
00:10:45,048 --> 00:10:47,594
with blue hot stars to the left

160
00:10:47,594 --> 00:10:50,673
and red cold ones to the right.

161
00:10:50,683 --> 00:10:54,485
It simply illustrates
Wien's displacement law

162
00:10:54,485 --> 00:10:56,355
for a black body spectrum.

163
00:10:56,355 --> 00:10:59,843
We now sort them by
luminosity and put

164
00:10:59,843 --> 00:11:03,152
the faint stars, with a
high magnitude, 

165
00:11:03,152 --> 00:11:06,457
at the bottom of the diagram,
and bright stars

166
00:11:06,457 --> 00:11:09,377
with small or even negative
magnitudes for the brightest

167
00:11:09,377 --> 00:11:12,299
at the top of the diagram.

168
00:11:12,299 --> 00:11:15,984
The resulting diagram is called
the Hertzsprung - Russell diagram,

169
00:11:15,984 --> 00:11:17,813
or HR diagram.

170
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:21,373
As you notice, stars are not
randomly distributed

171
00:11:21,373 --> 00:11:24,991
across the diagram but instead follow
a well defined sequence

172
00:11:24,991 --> 00:11:26,881
which we will now see.

173
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:29,462
What kind of stars are on the diagram,
where are they located

174
00:11:29,462 --> 00:11:31,206
and what are their physical parameters ?

175
00:11:32,294 --> 00:11:35,949
Here is a colour-magnitude diagram,
a Hertzsprung - Russell diagram

176
00:11:35,949 --> 00:11:39,121
for 22 000 stars of our Milky Way.

177
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:44,643
We have four axes on this diagram.

178
00:11:44,655 --> 00:11:50,762
We see at the top the spectral classes,
O B A F G K and M, ranging from

179
00:11:50,762 --> 00:11:54,039
the hottest temperatures,
around 30 - 40 000 Kelvin

180
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:56,909
to the lowest, about 3 000 Kelvin.

181
00:11:57,821 --> 00:12:00,383
We will draw the different axes.

182
00:12:00,383 --> 00:12:04,975
We have at the bottom an axis representing
the colour,  B-V for example

183
00:12:04,989 --> 00:12:07,671
with the lowest values to the left
and the highest to the right.

184
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:11,115
Red colours are on this side
and blue ones are here.

185
00:12:11,123 --> 00:12:14,774
A blue colour means a high
black body temperature.

186
00:12:14,774 --> 00:12:17,701
Therefore the top axis
showing the temperature

187
00:12:17,701 --> 00:12:22,416
varies in the opposite direction
to the bottom axis.

188
00:12:22,718 --> 00:12:25,050
We have here temperature

189
00:12:25,050 --> 00:12:26,935
increasing in this direction.

190
00:12:27,552 --> 00:12:34,291
The luminosity axis increases
in this direction.

191
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:39,937
Here is the luminosity of stars
in units of solar luminosity.

192
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:46,071
In the opposite side we have the
axis of absolute magnitudes

193
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:49,070
which increases downwards. 

194
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:51,680
The absolute magnitude is

195
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,154
the apparent magnitude
a star would have

196
00:12:53,154 --> 00:12:56,601
if it was located at a distance
of ten parsecs.

197
00:12:56,601 --> 00:13:02,503
The diagram shows several
classes of luminosity.

198
00:13:04,438 --> 00:13:07,556
We have here very big
and bright stars,

199
00:13:07,556 --> 00:13:10,793
hypergiant and supergiant stars.

200
00:13:11,335 --> 00:13:16,442
Here are the the bright giants,
the giants and the subgiants.

201
00:13:16,442 --> 00:13:21,116
80% of stars are actually
on this sequence called

202
00:13:21,116 --> 00:13:25,392
the main sequence. Stars burn
their hydrogen into helium

203
00:13:25,392 --> 00:13:28,273
during all their life
on this sequence.

204
00:13:28,273 --> 00:13:31,057
It is hence a mass sequence called
the main sequence.

205
00:13:33,314 --> 00:13:37,558
We have at last the sequence of dwarves.

206
00:13:37,573 --> 00:13:42,274
White dwarves are located
in this area

207
00:13:42,274 --> 00:13:44,213
of the colour-magnitude diagram.

208
00:13:45,712 --> 00:13:47,815
We have 22 000 stars of the Milky Way.

209
00:13:47,815 --> 00:13:49,831
80% of stars are located here

210
00:13:49,831 --> 00:13:52,879
and the stars which became giants

211
00:13:52,879 --> 00:13:56,333
are in this area of the 
colour-magnitude diagram.

212
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:02,709
We can also draw iso-radius 
contours on the diagram.

213
00:14:02,709 --> 00:14:06,534
We already said that the higher we are
on the diagram, the bigger the stars.

214
00:14:06,792 --> 00:14:11,350
To understand this, remember that
the luminosity of a star

215
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,193
depends on its surface.

216
00:14:14,193 --> 00:14:18,868
R is the radius of the star, and it
is multiplied by σ T^4.

217
00:14:18,868 --> 00:14:22,088
This can be rewritten in
terms of solar units.

218
00:14:22,088 --> 00:14:26,664
We have L over the solar luminosity

219
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:32,163
and here remains the squared
ratio of R over the solar radius

220
00:14:32,163 --> 00:14:36,079
since both 4π and σ vanished.
The same holds for the temperature

221
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:40,005
if one divides by the 
corresponding solar quantity.

222
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,871
We have such a relation

223
00:14:43,138 --> 00:14:44,894
that we can turn into a
logarithmic one.

224
00:14:44,939 --> 00:14:49,789
I do not rewrite each time
the solar units.

225
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:55,967
We obtain that the logarithm of L
is twice the logarithm of R

226
00:14:55,967 --> 00:14:59,613
plus four times the logarithm
of the temperature

227
00:14:59,613 --> 00:15:02,983
where of course everything is 
written in solar units :

228
00:15:02,983 --> 00:15:06,487
solar luminosities, solar radii
and solar temperatures.

229
00:15:06,797 --> 00:15:12,633
If R is constant we have
the equation of a straight line

230
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:19,498
in a log-log scale : a function
which behaves like y = ax+b

231
00:15:19,498 --> 00:15:24,423
where y is the logarithm of L,

232
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:31,184
b is twice the logarithm of R,
which stays constant

233
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:33,210
since R has a fixed value

234
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:39,295
and here is x, with the
constant a in front.

235
00:15:39,295 --> 00:15:43,400
This is simply the equation of a
straight line in the HR diagram,

236
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:45,769
in the colour-magnitude diagram.

237
00:15:45,769 --> 00:15:47,662
This straight line is drawn here

238
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:51,738
and here is the position of the Sun.

239
00:15:52,546 --> 00:15:55,767
Now let us change the value of the radius.

240
00:15:55,767 --> 00:15:59,406
Here we have one solar radius, one
solar luminosity and one solar temperature

241
00:15:59,406 --> 00:16:03,108
When R changes, the value of
the parameter b changes as well,

242
00:16:03,108 --> 00:16:05,391
therefore the y-intercept point
of this line changes.

243
00:16:05,391 --> 00:16:08,968
We are translating our line towards
the top or the bottom of the diagram.

244
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:15,214
By the way, since we are talking about
stellar radius, in the main sequence

245
00:16:19,454 --> 00:16:20,675
along this straight line,

246
00:16:21,548 --> 00:16:28,753
typical radii range between
0.1 solar radii up to

247
00:16:28,753 --> 00:16:31,118
15 solar radii.

248
00:16:31,118 --> 00:16:34,289
It is not the same thing for
giant or hypergiant stars.

249
00:16:34,289 --> 00:16:41,397
If we consider the whole range
of radii for all stars,

250
00:16:41,397 --> 00:16:43,443
then the range is obviously
much wider and we can reach

251
00:16:43,443 --> 00:16:48,374
up to 1000 solar radii

252
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:52,904
for hypergiant stars. On the
other hand, dwarf stars

253
00:16:52,904 --> 00:16:56,562
can have 1/100th of the solar radius.

254
00:16:56,562 --> 00:17:01,168
The range of radii, therefore, spans 
five orders of magnitude

255
00:17:01,168 --> 00:17:03,965
from one extreme radius
to the other extreme.

256
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,259
A note on the effect of
interstellar absorption

257
00:17:07,259 --> 00:17:09,173
in a colour-magnitude diagram :

258
00:17:09,173 --> 00:17:14,036
Remember that the observed
magnitude of an object

259
00:17:14,036 --> 00:17:17,109
is the intrinsic magnitude

260
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:19,586
plus some absorption,

261
00:17:19,586 --> 00:17:23,259
the positive sign is because, after
absorption, a star appears less bright

262
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:26,238
than its real magnitude, so the
magnitude will be larger

263
00:17:26,238 --> 00:17:28,114
and for that reason we add
a positive quantity.

264
00:17:28,114 --> 00:17:30,725
We saw that this absorption
coefficient depends on the colour :

265
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:36,490
the absorption does not
only cause an increase in magnitude

266
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:41,069
but also makes the stars appear
redder, as we saw

267
00:17:41,069 --> 00:17:44,174
in the chapter on the interstellar medium.

268
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,787
If we take the example
of this diagram

269
00:17:48,787 --> 00:17:53,633
with a stellar population
corresponding to a star cluster

270
00:17:53,633 --> 00:17:55,759
- this diagram shows the Milky
Way, but let us suppose

271
00:17:55,759 --> 00:17:59,705
that we observe a homogeneous stellar population,
a star cluster -

272
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:03,858
that we observe from Earth

273
00:18:03,858 --> 00:18:08,036
with dust clouds in-between,

274
00:18:08,046 --> 00:18:15,958
then the diagram will
be shifted downwards.

275
00:18:18,019 --> 00:18:24,181
The sequence is shifted downwards
but also reddens, which means

276
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:32,726
that we have a reddening vector
in the direction of increasing B-V.

277
00:18:32,726 --> 00:18:40,162
In conclusion, the diagram is shifted

278
00:18:40,162 --> 00:18:41,883
along a diagonal reddening vector.

279
00:18:41,883 --> 00:18:44,108
We therefore have to be cautious
on the conclusions of the

280
00:18:44,108 --> 00:18:45,544
study of a stellar population

281
00:18:45,544 --> 00:18:48,932
when we obtain such a
colour-magnitude or HR diagram

282
00:18:48,932 --> 00:18:52,266
because it can be affected by
reddening on the line of sight

283
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:54,654
of the star we are observing.

284
00:18:55,982 --> 00:18:57,890
A last word on the radius of stars.

285
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,865
We said that we can draw
isoradius straight lines

286
00:19:00,865 --> 00:19:03,418
in the colour-magnitude diagram.

287
00:19:03,418 --> 00:19:09,098
We will see here that the radius
cannot be directly measured

288
00:19:09,098 --> 00:19:14,094
To understand this, we can look 
at the flux received on Earth

289
00:19:14,094 --> 00:19:15,987
from a star at a distance d

290
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:26,653
and compute this flux as a 
function of the flux on the surface

291
00:19:26,653 --> 00:19:31,429
of the star with a radius r,
the luminous flux.

292
00:19:38,606 --> 00:19:41,000
The two fluxes relate as follow :

293
00:19:41,002 --> 00:19:47,543
the observed flux is the intrinsic
flux times the surface of the star

294
00:19:47,543 --> 00:19:53,517
times 1 over a sphere of radius d.

295
00:19:53,517 --> 00:20:02,648
We then deduce that f = F (R/d)².

296
00:20:02,648 --> 00:20:11,812
R/d is simply the angular radius of 
the star, the subtended radius of

297
00:20:11,812 --> 00:20:14,090
the star at some distance.

298
00:20:17,593 --> 00:20:24,955
We have here the radius of the star,
the angle α and the distance d.

299
00:20:25,861 --> 00:20:29,360
Considering a hypergiant star at
a distance of 200 parsec,

300
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:38,131
a very close star

301
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:44,389
with a radius of 1000
solar radii,

302
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:49,839
we get that α is roughly
equal to 0.02 arcsecond.

303
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,462
0.02 arcsecond is 
approximately half the size

304
00:20:53,462 --> 00:20:57,144
of the smallest visible detail
by current telescopes.

305
00:20:57,144 --> 00:21:01,124
It is therefore totally 
impossible to observe

306
00:21:01,124 --> 00:21:04,067
the surface of another
star than the Sun.

307
00:21:04,067 --> 00:21:08,136
The Sun is the only star on which
we see surface features.

308
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:12,698
The colour-magnitude diagram
is an incomparably precious tool

309
00:21:12,698 --> 00:21:14,228
to characterize stellar populations

310
00:21:14,228 --> 00:21:17,841
from the simple measurement
of colour and luminosity,

311
00:21:17,841 --> 00:21:20,011
the colour being linked
to the temperature.

312
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:23,275
Be attentive however that 
the diagram is valid only if

313
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:27,082
all the objects in it are at the same
distance from us, in other words if we show

314
00:21:27,082 --> 00:21:30,694
the diagram in terms of luminosity or
in terms of absolute magnitudes,

315
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:34,575
namely the magnitude brought to
an arbitrary distance of ten parsec.

316
00:21:35,174 --> 00:21:37,482
In the next video we will see
how stars move 

317
00:21:37,482 --> 00:21:39,636
in the diagram in the
course of their life.

318
00:21:39,636 --> 00:21:42,398
It is a whole domain
of astrophysics :

319
00:21:42,398 --> 00:21:44,342
the study of stellar evolution.
