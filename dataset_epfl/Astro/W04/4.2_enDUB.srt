1
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:10,030
In this video we will see with more details
what a comet is.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,930
They are very small bodies
with a diameter not much larger than a few

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,780
kilometres
and composed of 80% of water ice

4
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:22,360
as well as organic compounds
such as carbon, hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:27,759
Comets come from a large spherical cloud
at the limit of the solar system, known as

6
00:00:27,759 --> 00:00:30,789
the Oort Cloud,
named after the Dutch astronomer

7
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:35,510
who first suggested its existence.
The spherical geometry of the cloud and its

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,720
supposed size
of the order of 100'000 astronomical units,

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,790
that is, 100'000 times the size of the Earth
orbit,

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,410
are deduced from the fact that the orbits
of comets have

11
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,780
sometimes an extreme eccentricity, so they
are extremely elongated.

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:53,730
They have sometimes very long orbital periods
up to several centuries,

13
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:57,470
such as the Halley comet with a period of
76 years,

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:00,870
and the orbital inclinations are distributed
almost randomly.

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,040
In other words, comets come
randomly from all directions.

16
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,760
At the distance of the Oort cloud,
the gravitational forces from stars other

17
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,720
than the Sun
are not negligible any more, so that from

18
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:14,740
time to time,
a small gravitational perturbation

19
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:19,500
caused by stars in the Milky Way are able
to pull a comet out of the cloud and through

20
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,330
it toward the Sun.
In some way, the Oort cloud is

21
00:01:25,330 --> 00:01:29,950
a natural reservoir of comets
created at the same time as the solar system.

22
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:35,370
This is why the study of comets is so essential.
They consist in genuine fossils of our solar

23
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:39,080
system
composed of the primordial matter that formed

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:43,850
the planets
and that may be at the origin of life.

25
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:48,840
Here are two cometary nuclei visited by the
NASA mission Deep Impact.

26
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:56,690
Left is Tempel 1 with a diameter of 7.6 km
and right is Hartley 2 with a very small nucleus

27
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:00,710
of 2.2 km wide.
When a comet approaches the Sun, the surface

28
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:04,420
of the nucleus melts
and matter is ejected to form large and diffuse

29
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,820
tails
such as here with the comet Hale-Bopp.

30
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:13,150
You see here the blue ionised tail, composed
of gas,

31
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:15,650
and the other one, more diffuse, composed
of dust

32
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:23,340
spreads here with a greyish colour.
We will see in more details in this video

33
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:30,290
how cometary tails are formed.
Let us have a look at how cometary tails are

34
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:32,540
formed.
We consider a cometary particle

35
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:36,969
at the surface of the comet, on a orbit with
a period P_1

36
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:40,849
at a given distance of the Sun. Following
the third Kepler's law

37
00:02:40,849 --> 00:02:45,180
with the period P here, divided by the distance
to the Sun a there.

38
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:49,079
And M here is the mass of the Sun.
We have a competition between two forces.

39
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:55,019
On the one hand, is the gravitational force
acting on this grain

40
00:02:55,019 --> 00:03:00,150
and on the other hand is the radiative pressure.
Lets call the force created by this radiative

41
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:05,029
pressure F rad
The dust grain is at equilibrium between the

42
00:03:05,029 --> 00:03:09,859
two forces.
It has a given mass, a given cross section

43
00:03:09,859 --> 00:03:12,499
and therefore a given size.
There is an opposition

44
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:18,129
between the radiative pressure
caused by solar photons

45
00:03:18,129 --> 00:03:22,799
collected on its cross section
and the gravitational force which also depends

46
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,120
on the size of the grain
through its density.

47
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,129
The effect of the radiation is proportional
to R²,

48
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:36,200
the particle cross section,
and the mass is proportional to 4/3 de π

49
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:39,549
R³
where R is the radius of the grain.

50
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:45,290
Obviously, as soon as the radiative pressure
exceeds the gravitational force,

51
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:48,319
the grain is ejected of the surface of the
comet

52
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:51,739
and leaves then radially with regard to the
Sun.

53
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:54,129
When this happens, the grain reaches another
orbit

54
00:03:54,129 --> 00:04:02,209
with another orbital radius.
We see here the change of orbit.

55
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:05,219
We push the grain, so it leaves to another
orbit

56
00:04:05,219 --> 00:04:11,139
with a period larger than the orbital period
of the comet.

57
00:04:11,139 --> 00:04:16,889
Therefore the grain drifts behind the comet.
And now for an even larger orbit.

58
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:20,590
By simply writing the third Kepler's law we
see that the orbital period

59
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:24,370
gets larger when the radius increases.
A grain with some momentum

60
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:34,680
given by the solar photons
is pushed over time to orbits of greater radii

61
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:40,610
and therefore of greater periods.
We have thus the formation of a curved cometary

62
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:43,669
tail.
But there is more. We can also have grains

63
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:50,229
much smaller in size and as such much lighter,
such as molecules for example. Molecules are

64
00:04:50,229 --> 00:04:57,169
immediately
ejected outside of the orbit.

65
00:04:57,169 --> 00:04:59,949
Therefore the grains do not have time to change
orbit in

66
00:04:59,949 --> 00:05:05,520
such a continuous way.
They are directly swept by the solar wind.

67
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,430
We were saying that there is an opposition
between

68
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:19,349
the gravitational force
and the radiative pressure,

69
00:05:19,349 --> 00:05:23,729
as well as an equilibrium between the two
forces.

70
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:31,400
Let us write this equilibrium.
How do we express the radiative pressure?

71
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:36,990
Each photon has a given energy
E = hν

72
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,150
and a given momentum p.
Its energy can be expressed as a function

73
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:47,110
of the momentum.
The momentum p associated to each photon

74
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:50,569
is equal to its energy divided by the speed
of light c.

75
00:05:50,569 --> 00:06:00,150
The radiative pressure F_rad
can be written as E/c since each time

76
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:05,060
a photon is absorbed by the dust grain
or the molecule on the comet

77
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:12,750
it gains momentum equals to E/c.
That is, the momentum change of the dust grain

78
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,960
is E/c,
which is a force.

79
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:21,039
Of course not all photons are absorbed
by the cometary particle.

80
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,409
Only the photons with an appropriate impact
parameter

81
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:30,700
are absorbed.
This impact parameter is simply the grain

82
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:42,610
cross section,
namely σ_g.

83
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:52,969
Let us now compute the different forces.
We have first the gravitational force here

84
00:06:52,969 --> 00:06:59,840
and the radiative pressure.
The grain has a given cross section :

85
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:09,090
σ_g = π R².
The mass of the grain is :

86
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:21,250
4/3 π R³ ρ_g
where ρ_g is its density.

87
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:26,639
Let us now express the different forces.
The norm of the radiative pressure F_rad is

88
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:36,379
E/c * σ_g.
Now E is the solar energy received by the

89
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:42,349
grain,
so it is simply the solar luminosity L

90
00:07:42,349 --> 00:07:48,840
over 4 π r²
We have obviously the factor c here

91
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:58,039
and the cross section of the grain, π R²
Note the upper case R.

92
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:07,499
Then we have the gravitational force.
It is the gravitational force exerted by the

93
00:08:07,499 --> 00:08:09,870
Sun on the grain :
it is G M, where M is the mass of the Sun,

94
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:17,479
it is G M, where M is the mass of the Sun,
times m_g the mass of the grain that we expressed

95
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,249
here,
divided by the distance between the two bodies,

96
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:25,189
r²
With the density expressed previously here.

97
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:31,259
The gravitational force
can also be written as :

98
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:40,260
G M / r²
times ρ_g the grain density,

99
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:51,690
times 4/3 π R³, the cube of the grain radius.
We can now compute the ratio between the norm

100
00:08:51,690 --> 00:08:57,520
of the gravitational force and the norm of
the radiative pressure force.

101
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,820
If we rearrange all these terms,
we find the ratio to be :

102
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:09,260
16 π G times the mass of the Sun
times R the radius of the grain,

103
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:19,070
times its density and the speed of light,
over 3 times the solar luminosity.

104
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:22,960
We have simply expressed the ratio by rearranging
the terms

105
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:26,280
as functions of the quantities that we previously
defined here.

106
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:31,250
We are of course interested in knowing whether
there is an equilibrium or not.

107
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:37,370
We can for example deduce
the radius of the grain that ensures equilibrium.

108
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:46,650
We can define a critical radius
for which a typical cometary dust

109
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:55,350
is of roughly 2000 angströms.
This is the maximum radius of a dust grain

110
00:09:55,350 --> 00:10:00,820
under which the grain remains bound to the
comet.

111
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,680
We saw that the mass of the grain is of the
order of R³

112
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,460
while the cross section is of the order of
R².

113
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:10,720
When the grain gets too big,
it becomes too heavy in regards to its cross

114
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,000
section
and cannot leave the surface of the comet

115
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,710
anymore.
In such a case, the solar photons are not

116
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:18,400
able to
eject the grain from the surface of the comet

117
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:21,000
anymore.
Here is a typical example of the spreading

118
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,620
of two cometary tails.
There is first a tail of light particules,

119
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:32,050
a tail of ions,
that are generally CO+ ions.

120
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:34,930
These particules are extremely light and extremely
small

121
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:38,940
so they are ejected directly out of the orbit
of the comet

122
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:47,150
by the solar photons.
And here is a dust tail.

123
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:50,910
These particles are much heavier.
It takes more time to transfer momentum

124
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:58,270
from the solar photons to the cometary particles
and therefore to change their orbit.

125
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:01,130
It takes longer to push them away from the
orbit of the comet

126
00:11:01,130 --> 00:11:07,080
and are affected by Kepler's laws
and therefore slowly drift behind the comet.

127
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:12,960
We can see this on another picture.
We have here the comet McNaught imaged from

128
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,930
the observatory
of Cerro Paranal in Chile.

129
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:20,390
This is where the VLT is located, the European
« Very Large Telescope »

130
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:27,560
composed of four 8m telescopes in the Andes.
This picture is taken just after sunset.

131
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:36,940
I draw the Sun here.
Of course the Sun emits photons isotropically.

132
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:40,580
The orbit of the comet around the Sun is roughly
like that,

133
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,600
or at least we can materialize it in this
way.

134
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:50,630
And here are the radius vectors.
You remember that these radius vectors

135
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:55,520
sweep out equal areas in equal times.
This was the second Kepler's law that we show

136
00:11:55,520 --> 00:12:01,350
here as a reminder.
Finally we have the solar photons

137
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:03,930
which are produced radially in such a way
here.

138
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:08,430
which are produced radially in such a way
here.

139
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:13,170
Two cometary tails are formed. The ion tail
is in this direction.

140
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:18,230
On this picture it is very thin, we almost
cannot see it

141
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,430
but the particles are indeed ejected in this
direction,

142
00:12:22,430 --> 00:12:25,180
radially with respect to the orbit of the
comet.

143
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:30,000
The heavier particles
are affected more slowly over time by the

144
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,180
Sun's radiative pressure.
So particles will change their orbit.

145
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:41,380
Here is an orbit with a period P_1
and here a period P_2 greater than P_1.

146
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:50,200
If I add another point on the orbit there,
it will have a period P_3 greater than P_2

147
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:55,480
just like on the slide we showed previously.
Since all these orbits have greater and greater

148
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,000
periods,
the cometary dust grains are delayed

149
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:04,580
with respect to the cometary nucleus
which of course stays on the same orbit with

150
00:13:04,580 --> 00:13:08,920
a period P_1.
We have seen how the solar photons

151
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:15,570
can change the trajectory of cometary particles
through the radiative pressure.

152
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,490
As many physical phenomena presented during
this course,

153
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:24,010
the one we just saw while studying comets
manifests itself in several scenarios

154
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:27,470
such as for example the formation and life
of stars.

155
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:30,740
We will see that the radiative pressure
due to the photons

156
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:34,790
created in thermonuclear reactions in the
core of stars prevents them

157
00:13:34,790 --> 00:13:39,200
from a gravitational collapse
and thus allow them to shine for millions,

158
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,610
or even billions of years.
