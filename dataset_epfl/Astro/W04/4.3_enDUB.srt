1
00:00:06,129 --> 00:00:09,379
We will now talk about the planets and their
atmospheres

2
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:12,590
and in particular on their influence on the
physical conditions

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:17,210
on the surface of a planet.
The Earth, Venus and Mars are for example

4
00:00:17,210 --> 00:00:21,039
three very similar planets
yet their atmosphere are very different

5
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,359
as well as the meteorological features on
their surface.

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:29,289
We will see in a simplified manner
how the energy budget of a planet,

7
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:32,649
namely the balance between received and emitted
energy,

8
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:35,600
completely determines the physical conditions
on the surface

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,970
and therefore maybe the development of life.
For example, on Venus the greenhouse effect

10
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:43,980
is such that
the surface temperature is completely determined

11
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,330
by atmospheric physics
and the atmosphere is so opaque to radiation

12
00:00:48,330 --> 00:00:52,500
that only radar imaging is able to unveil
the surface of the planet,

13
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,190
such as on this picture taken by NASA's Magellan
probe.

14
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:00,510
To understand the influence of planetary atmospheres
on their planet,

15
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,189
let us have a look at the energy budget of
each planet,

16
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:08,290
in particular the Earth.
We have here a simplified representation of

17
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,770
the solar system.
The Sun is here,

18
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:17,600
the Earth is here
and here we have another planet, Saturn for

19
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,890
example.
The Earth is of course at one astronomical

20
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:27,630
unit away from the Sun
and Saturn, or any other planet, is at a distance

21
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,560
d.
We will now look at the energy budget,

22
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:38,490
what is the energy received by planets
and what is the energy emitted by planets.

23
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:49,310
First the energy received on Earth.
The energy received at the top of the atmosphere

24
00:01:49,310 --> 00:02:04,570
can be measured for example by satellites
and is called the solar constant.

25
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:10,550
The solar constant S is an energy flux,
or more accurately a power flux, the numerical

26
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:17,420
value of which is :
1.37 · 10^6 erg / cm² s

27
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:25,510
1.37 · 10^6 erg / cm² s
since the solar energy is diluted, spread

28
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:30,400
over a sphere with a surface of 4π times
the square of one astronomical unit.

29
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:37,480
At a distance d,
namely the distance d here,

30
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:45,520
S(d) is the solar energy,
S integrated on a sphere with a surface of

31
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:48,390
4π
times the square of one astronomical unit

32
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,849
:
4π · d(Earth),

33
00:02:52,849 --> 00:02:55,700
so this is the square of one astronomical
unit,

34
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,450
and diluted on a sphere with a surface of
4πd².

35
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:10,660
We have then here 1 / 4πd².
Finally S(d) is simply a rescaling of S

36
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:19,970
by a factor (d(Earth)/d)²
by a factor (d(Earth)/d)²

37
00:03:19,970 --> 00:03:22,170
We have just seen the energy received by the
Earth.

38
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:25,950
Now let us have a look at the full energy
balance for the Earth.

39
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:31,550
We have some energy here that is absorbed,
which we just talked about.

40
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:40,440
It is the energy flux coming from the Sun.
We have some emitted energy

41
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,620
which is the energy produced by the planet
itself

42
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:46,730
for example due to radioactivity in the mantle
or the terrestrial crust.

43
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:51,610
Finally there is some radiated energy.
This radiated energy is

44
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:58,790
due to the black body radiation.
E_cn here is a black body radiation.

45
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:02,210
If we observe the Earth from outside of the
solar system

46
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:05,870
and measure its spectrum, we will see a black
body spectrum.

47
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:10,069
What is now the energy balance?
There is the solar flux which is absorbed

48
00:04:10,069 --> 00:04:14,130
energy
and there is energy emitted directly by the

49
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:19,660
Earth.
Their sum must be equal to the black body

50
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:22,220
energy,
the one we observe from outside the solar

51
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:26,060
system,
the energy that an outside observer would

52
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:31,820
receive.
We rewrite the absorbed energy

53
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:41,790
as a function of the solar constant.
It is equal to the solar constant

54
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:48,560
times the Earth's cross section.
It is the energy received on Earth.

55
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:58,150
The Earth's cross section is πR².
Obviously only a part of the light is absorbed

56
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:03,060
and the rest is reflected.
We express this with the factor 1-A

57
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:09,460
where A is called the albedo.
If A = 1 then all the radiation is reflected

58
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:34,210
and if A = 0 all of it is absorbed.
For the Earth, A = 0,3.

59
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:41,640
So we have an absorbed radiation
plus an emitted radiation, of which we're

60
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:47,260
going to talk later,
equal to the black body radiation.

61
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:54,530
As we just wrote, the absorbed radiation is
π times the radius of the Earth squared,

62
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,090
namely the cross section,
times the solar constant, times 1 minus the

63
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:04,090
Albedo.
The emitted radiation, which can for example

64
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:09,320
be produced
by the liquid magma under the terrestrial

65
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:13,560
crust and its radioactivity,
is the surface of the Earth,

66
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:19,710
4 π · R(Earth)²
times Q the produced energy

67
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:29,260
by this radioactivity, say at ground level.
We can measure the value of Q

68
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:40,310
and find 0,06 W/m² at ground level.
and find 0,06 W/m² at ground level.

69
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:46,060
We multiply Q by the factor 4πR²
to get the total energy emitted by Earth at

70
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,600
ground level.
Now what about the energy radiated as black

71
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:54,760
body radiation.
As we saw in the lecture on the black body,

72
00:06:54,760 --> 00:07:02,830
a black body emits an energy flux depending
on its temperature : σT^4.

73
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:09,320
So we have σT^4, T being the effective temperature
of the black body.

74
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:14,150
We have to multiply this by the total surface
radiating this flux

75
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:17,980
which is simply 4π times the Earth's radius
squared.

76
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:23,490
This gives the complete energy balance.
Let us rewrite this equation in a slightly

77
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:31,880
different manner.
So we have :

78
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:36,370
the absorbed energy plus the emitted energy
is the black body energy.

79
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:47,479
If we rearrange the different terms,
we end-up with the following equation.

80
00:07:47,479 --> 00:07:53,460
So we have 4σT^4,
with T the effective temperature

81
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:56,680
which is actually the parameter we are interested
in,

82
00:07:56,680 --> 00:08:05,169
over (1 - A) · S.
For the Earth,

83
00:08:05,169 --> 00:08:19,639
A = 0,3
which means that 30% of the light is reflected.

84
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:27,520
We also had that Q = 0.06 W/m²
We also had that Q = 0.06 W/m²

85
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:31,990
at the Earth's surface.
The solar constant S on the terrestrial orbit

86
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:37,729
is
S = 1,37 · 10^6 erg / cm² s

87
00:08:37,729 --> 00:08:44,760
S = 1,37 · 10^6 erg / cm² s
If we plug all these numbers in this equation

88
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:53,690
we get that the black body temperature
of the Earth is 255 K.

89
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,220
Note that this is the Earth's black body effective
temperature

90
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:02,220
and not the temperature at ground level
which is completely dominated by the climatology,

91
00:09:02,220 --> 00:09:06,730
by Earth's atmosphere.
We just saw that the Earth behaves like a

92
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:16,940
black body.
We have the Earth with an atmosphere

93
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:21,050
acting as a filter.
We have on the one hand the incoming radiation

94
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:27,890
from the Sun
which is UV and visible light

95
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:35,180
and on the other hand the outgoing radiation
which is infrared light

96
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:38,850
since we have a black body with a temperature
of 255 K

97
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:44,560
which peaks in the infrared domain.
On one side we have UV radiation.

98
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,890
If I draw here the emitted or received
flux on Earth as a function of the wavelength,

99
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:58,950
we have a black body curve.
So this is a black body at a temperature of

100
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:00,690
5780 K,
So this is a black body at a temperature of

101
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:06,060
5780 K,
namely the Sun.

102
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:10,750
This is some radiation with a peak in the
UV/optical according to Wien's law

103
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:16,920
and it is an incoming radiation.
We have therefore an incoming UV/optical radiation

104
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,990
which attempts to pass through the Earth's
atmosphere

105
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:24,200
acting itself as a filter.
The Earth itself, as we just computed,

106
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,899
emits black body radiation,
with a curve of the same shape

107
00:10:29,899 --> 00:10:32,339
but this time with a black body temperature
of 255 K.

108
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,740
but this time with a black body temperature
of 255 K.

109
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:47,570
The Earth emits then in the infrared domain,
and this is an outgoing radiation.

110
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:52,920
What happens in the atmosphere ?
We show here as a function of the altitude

111
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,800
and of the wavelength
the different filters blocking the several

112
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:09,800
kinds of radiation.
First in the upper atmosphere, at an altitude

113
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,209
of 10km,
First in the upper atmosphere, at an altitude

114
00:11:12,209 --> 00:11:18,000
of 10km,
we have water molecules

115
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:29,570
and ozone molecules.
At ground level, up to a few hundred metres

116
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:39,080
or a few kilometres high,
we have CO2 particles

117
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:43,160
as well as of course some water.
There is also water quite high in the atmosphere.

118
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:48,800
There is also water quite high in the atmosphere.
It can be water created by the burning of

119
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:53,000
kerosene
by the engines of airplanes.

120
00:11:53,000 --> 00:12:00,410
So here we have water produced by airplanes
and water naturally present at ground level.

121
00:12:00,410 --> 00:12:04,930
On the ground, the CO2 is partly caused by
cars.

122
00:12:04,930 --> 00:12:12,410
There is here an ozone layer,
that CFC can destroy.

123
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:16,170
If we consider all of these together, we have
:

124
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:25,580
UV light that enters the atmosphere
which would be blocked by the ozone layer

125
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:30,410
but if the ozone has been destroyed it cannot
filter this radiation.

126
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:36,120
If the ozone has been destroyed,
the UV radiation can penetrate all the way

127
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:40,150
to the ground level
because there are no more natural filters.

128
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:46,070
UV light is blocked by ozone.
If the ozone layer is destroyed, UV radiation

129
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,209
can enter the atmosphere
and thus contribute to warming the Earth.

130
00:12:49,209 --> 00:12:51,970
This obviously applies
to any other planet

131
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:56,550
which has incoming and outgoing radiation
with several filters either at ground level

132
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:00,160
or at high altitude.
We have then UV light blocked by ozone,

133
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:02,990
which is not blocked if the ozone layer has
been destroyed,

134
00:13:02,990 --> 00:13:08,700
and we have an infrared outgoing radiation.
This outgoing radiation could naturally escape

135
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:17,750
if there was no filter such as CO2
which indeed blocks infrared.

136
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:21,500
As a result there is less outgoing radiation
than there should

137
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:27,779
and some energy is retained at ground level
by this CO2, as well as by the water at high

138
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:32,670
altitude,
water also being an infrared filter.

139
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:40,610
Water is naturally found at ground level
but not at high altitude.

140
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:44,750
Water ejected by the burning of kerosene by
airplane motors

141
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:49,540
acts like a filter blocking the outgoing infrared
radiation.

142
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:55,750
This shows that the climate we know on Earth
and the greenhouse effect on Earth

143
00:13:55,750 --> 00:14:00,540
are due to the Sun's temperature,
the Earth's black body radiation,

144
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:08,140
and the chemical composition of the atmosphere,
which is either natural or artificially altered

145
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:10,779
by mankind
and sets up a number of filters

146
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:15,640
blocking incoming or outgoing radiation.
There is a natural equilibrium unless any

147
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,040
change is imposed by human activities.
This equilibrium can be broken for example

148
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:22,860
by adding filters here,
water and CO2

149
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:29,680
or by destroying filters protecting it
from the incoming ultraviolet radiation.

150
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:34,180
Let us see a few numbers about the influences
on the surface temperature of a planet.

151
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:39,350
If we take Venus, the Earth and Mars as example,
we see that the solar constant decreases with

152
00:14:39,350 --> 00:14:43,100
the distance
but not the black body temperatures

153
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,829
due to the quite different albedos of the
planets

154
00:14:45,829 --> 00:14:49,089
and due to the small amount of intrisic energy
produced.

155
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:54,079
However the surface temperature varies heavily
due to the presence of an atmosphere

156
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,300
regulating the energy fluxes
between the planet and the rest of the Universe.
