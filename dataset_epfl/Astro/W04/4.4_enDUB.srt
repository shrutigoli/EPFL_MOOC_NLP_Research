How to characterize planetary atmospheres
?

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,769
They can be either very thin such as the one
of Mars shown here

3
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:15,080
or extremely dense, which the case of gaseous
planets

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:20,000
such as Jupiter or Saturn.
Why can some planets retain their atmosphere

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,390
while others cannot ?
In this video we will explore

6
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:28,609
some answers to these questions.
Among the tools we have access to

7
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:34,470
to characterize planetary atmospheres
is the hydrostatic equilibrium equation.

8
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:40,250
As the name suggests, it expresses an equilibrium
between the gas pressure acting in this direction

9
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:45,890
and
the gravitational force acting in the opposite

10
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,449
direction.
We represent these 2 forces acting on a volume

11
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:53,820
element,
We represent these 2 forces acting on a volume

12
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,839
element,
and we will see how to use this equation,

13
00:00:55,839 --> 00:00:59,570
how to establish the equation of hydrostatic
equilibrium

14
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:02,530
which measures the equilibrium between an
infinitesimal pressure

15
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:09,719
and an infinitesimal gravitational force.
We have drawn here a volume element

16
00:01:09,719 --> 00:01:13,240
with an area dA
and a height dh.

17
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:23,149
The mass density is ρ
and this small volume element is

18
00:01:23,149 --> 00:01:30,750
at a given altitude h.
h is the altitude in what follows.

19
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:35,319
There is here an infinitesimal pressure,
the force of which is dP · dA.

20
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:39,630
If we are interested in the pressure exerted
on our infinitesimal volume,

21
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:43,869
we write it as dP · dA.
Since we seek the equation of hydrostatic

22
00:01:43,869 --> 00:01:49,819
equilibrium,
this must be equal to - dF_g

23
00:01:49,819 --> 00:01:53,520
which is the gravitational force exerted on
this infinitesimal volume.

24
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,020
The gravitational force is of course the mass
of the volume element,

25
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:00,960
that is the density, which depends on the
altitude,

26
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,609
times the gravitational field which can also
depend on the altitude,

27
00:02:05,609 --> 00:02:10,929
times the volume of our small cylinder : dA
· dh.

28
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:15,660
We see that dA vanishes
and we can then rewrite this equation in this

29
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:25,500
form :
dP/dh = - ρ(h) .g(h)

30
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,940
Depending on the conditions in which we use
this equation,

31
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:33,810
we can very often assume that
ρ(h) is a constant, ρ.

32
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:39,010
Moreover, if we have a big planet with a relatively
thin atmosphere

33
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:46,760
g is almost independent of the altitude.
We can therefore assume g(h) to be a constant

34
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:55,300
g.
Thus, ρ, g, or both of them can be constants.

35
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,050
Let us rewrite the equation of hydrostatic
equilibrium

36
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:02,300
that we have just seen.
We had : dP / dh = - ρ g.

37
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:08,480
We had : dP / dh = - ρ g.
Let us solve this equation.

38
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:19,710
We recall the ideal gas law
which tells us that P = nkT

39
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:28,370
with T the temperature, k the Boltzmann constant
and n the numerical density of particles.

40
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:31,380
This numerical density
is the mass density over the mean mass of

41
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:41,560
a particle.
We have thus here μ, the mean molecular mass,

42
00:03:41,560 --> 00:04:02,290
the computation of which we will show later,
and m_u is the atomic mass unit.

43
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:13,400
Thanks to the ideal gas law,
we get an expression for ρ.

44
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:16,280
By rearranging the terms, we have that ρ
= P μ m_u / kT

45
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:25,590
By rearranging the terms, we have that ρ
= P μ m_u / kT

46
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:28,979
which I plug in the equation of hydrostatic
equilibrium

47
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:33,210
to get that dP, not any more over dh but over
P,

48
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:40,879
is equal to, by rearranging the terms
- g μ m_u / kT times dh

49
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:49,710
- g μ m_u / kT times dh
We have on the left hand side a dimensionless

50
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:55,419
quantity
so the right hand side must also be dimensionless.

51
00:04:55,419 --> 00:05:05,349
Therefore the dimension of this term is the
inverse of a length.

52
00:05:05,349 --> 00:05:09,060
Let us rewrite once again the equation of
hydrostatic equilibrium

53
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:14,749
in a slightly different manner.
We still have dP / P

54
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:21,490
and the term dh we had previously.
We had a term which was the inverse of a length

55
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:25,379
here,
so we write 1 / H

56
00:05:25,379 --> 00:05:33,840
with H = kT / g μ m_u.
with H = kT / g μ m_u.

57
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:43,740
This equation is now very easy to solve.
The pressure is a constant times

58
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,650
the exponential of -h / H .
H is the characteristic height of the atmosphere.

59
00:05:48,650 --> 00:06:02,860
H is the characteristic height of the atmosphere.
At ground level, when h = 0,

60
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:08,250
P is the ground pressure.
We have thus simply that P is equal to P_0,

61
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:14,800
the ground pressure,
times the exponential of - h / H.

62
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:27,610
Let us draw this relation on a figure.
We can plot either the altitude as a function

63
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:33,169
of the pressure, or the other way around.
We have here the altitude h

64
00:06:33,169 --> 00:06:36,460
and here is P. We are thus drawing the pressure
profile.

65
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:43,080
The pressure profile is an exponential curve
which looks roughly like this.

66
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,650
Here is the zero altitude
so the pressure at this point is P_0.

67
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:57,029
At this point, where h = H,
the 

68
00:06:57,029 --> 00:07:06,120
pressure is P_0 / e.
Again, we are here at ground level

69
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,189
and here at high altitude.
This of course assumes that we have solved

70
00:07:09,189 --> 00:07:13,059
this equation
in an extremely simple case.

71
00:07:13,059 --> 00:07:20,409
A word on the computation of the mean molecular
mass,

72
00:07:20,409 --> 00:07:25,550
which we noted as a mean μ.
Let us make the computation with the Earth

73
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:29,960
as an example.
It represents the mean number of particles

74
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,259
in the atmosphere.
We simplify the Earth's atmosphere

75
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:39,909
by assuming that there is 78% of molecular
nitrogen

76
00:07:39,909 --> 00:07:46,400
and 22% of molecular oxygen.
What we want to do is

77
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,699
to count the mean number of particles in the
atmosphere.

78
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:57,110
The molecular nitrogen is N2, the molecular
oxygen is O2.

79
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:01,949
The nitrogen atom has 7 protons and 7 neutrons
therefore 14 nucleons.

80
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:09,490
14 nucleons for 1 nitrogen atom
means that for the molecule N2

81
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:18,650
we have 28 atomic mass units.
The oxygen atom has 16 nucleons

82
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:27,469
and thus for O2 we have 32 atomic mass units.
What is the mean molecular mass?

83
00:08:27,469 --> 00:08:34,330
It is a weighted mean mass.
The weights are simply the proportion of each

84
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:37,530
element
in the atmosphere.

85
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:45,750
We have 78% times 28 atomic mass unit
plus 22% times 32 atomic mass unit

86
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:56,230
which we normalize to 0.78 + 0.22
and we find 29 atomic mass unit.

87
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:01,810
Once we have g, ρ and H,
how can we use this quantity

88
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:06,649
to see for example if a planet is able to
retain its atmosphere or not?

89
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:16,750
We can consider the escape velocity of a molecule.
We can compare

90
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:24,389
the escape velocity of a molecule in the atmosphere
with its most probable velocity.

91
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:35,829
If a particle has a very large ejection speed,
it can break away from

92
00:09:35,829 --> 00:09:40,190
the gravitational attraction of the planet
and as such the planet does not retain its

93
00:09:40,190 --> 00:09:43,330
atmosphere.
Therefore we want to compare the escape velocity

94
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:46,649
of the molecules
with the most probable velocity of the molecules

95
00:09:46,649 --> 00:09:54,370
in the atmosphere.
We write the escape velocity v_e and it is

96
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:58,950
greater than
the mean velocity of the molecules.

97
00:09:58,950 --> 00:10:03,610
v_e is the escape velocity
which is obtained by computing the kinetic

98
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:06,440
energy
of a particle with a mass m and the escape

99
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,079
velocity
and equalling this kinetic energy to the potential

100
00:10:11,079 --> 00:10:17,029
energy of the particle
in a gravitational field g

101
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:25,019
where R is the planetary radius
since we consider the altitude zero.

102
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:30,449
This relation yields immediately the escape
velocity, i.e.,

103
00:10:30,449 --> 00:10:34,130
the square root of 2 g times the radius of
the planet.

104
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:39,529
We have on the one hand the escape velocity
and on the other hand the most probable velocity.

105
00:10:39,529 --> 00:10:45,130
We have a gas with thermal agitation.
As such, the velocity distribution is a Boltzmann

106
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:49,810
distribution
just like in thermodynamics

107
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:58,160
and the most probable mean velocity
is the Gaussian mean of the velocity distribution,

108
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:02,480
which is equal to the squared root of 2 k
T,

109
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:08,660
where k is still the Boltzmann constant,
over µ m_u .

110
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:14,810
Here is where the H we previously saw appears.
We can rewrite this mean velocity as

111
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,870
the square root of 2 g H, where H is the characteristic
height

112
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,959
we previously computed.
The relation we wrote,

113
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:34,060
so, V_e > and the mean V_m,
can be finally written as a comparison

114
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:38,310
between the planetary radius and the characteristic
height of the atmosphere.

115
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:54,990
In such a case, if R_p > H
the planet can keep its atmosphere.

116
00:11:54,990 --> 00:12:00,690
We have thus established a very simple relation
from the characteristic height of a planet

117
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:03,790
that tells, by simply comparing the planetary
radius with

118
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:09,060
the characteristic height of the atmosphere,
if a planet can retain its atmosphere or not.

119
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,810
Here is the data from the previous video
for Venus, the Earth and Mars

120
00:12:13,810 --> 00:12:16,500
with the addition of the new quantities we
just introduced :

121
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:21,860
the pressure at ground level, the characteristic
height H

122
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:26,120
and the radius of the planets.
We first notice that in the 3 cases

123
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,690
the planet retains its atmosphere
since H is negligible in regards to the planetary

124
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:35,400
radius.
De facto, the 3 planets, the Earth, Venus

125
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:40,399
and Mars have indeed an atmosphere.
In the second place we notice extreme differences

126
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:44,139
between the surface pressures
although the 3 planets are otherwise very

127
00:12:44,139 --> 00:12:47,589
similar
and they moreover have comparable black body

128
00:12:47,589 --> 00:12:51,180
temperatures.
This shows once again that the composition

129
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:57,639
of the atmospheres
and their ability to interact with radiation

130
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:00,910
completely determines the physics at the surface
of a planet

131
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,639
as well as the complete temperature and pressure
profiles

132
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:07,720
of the atmospheres with the altitude.
