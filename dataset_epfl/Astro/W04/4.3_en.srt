1
00:00:05,284 --> 00:00:08,505
We will now talk about the
planets and their atmospheres

2
00:00:08,505 --> 00:00:11,857
and in particular on their influence
on the physical conditions

3
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:13,253
on the surface of a planet.

4
00:00:13,623 --> 00:00:17,845
The Earth, Venus and Mars are for
example three very similar planets

5
00:00:18,015 --> 00:00:20,123
yet their atmosphere
are very different

6
00:00:20,293 --> 00:00:23,019
as well as the meteorological
features on their surface.

7
00:00:23,409 --> 00:00:26,092
We will see in a simplified manner

8
00:00:26,452 --> 00:00:28,430
how the energy budget of a planet,

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,282
namely the balance between
received and emitted energy,

10
00:00:31,282 --> 00:00:34,600
completely determines the
physical conditions on the surface

11
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:37,656
and therefore maybe the
development of life.

12
00:00:37,926 --> 00:00:40,796
For example, on Venus the 
greenhouse effect is such that

13
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:44,656
the surface temperature is completely
determined by atmospheric physics

14
00:00:45,106 --> 00:00:47,197
and the atmosphere is so
opaque to radiation

15
00:00:47,477 --> 00:00:51,490
that only radar imaging is able to
unveil the surface of the planet,

16
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,843
such as on this picture taken by
NASA's Magellan probe.

17
00:00:55,363 --> 00:00:58,150
To understand the influence
of planetary atmospheres

18
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,377
on their planet,

19
00:00:59,637 --> 00:01:03,317
let us have a look at the energy
budget of each planet,

20
00:01:03,347 --> 00:01:05,092
in particular the Earth.

21
00:01:05,142 --> 00:01:10,275
We have here a simplified
representation of the solar system.

22
00:01:10,275 --> 00:01:11,563
The Sun is here,

23
00:01:11,943 --> 00:01:14,284
the Earth is here

24
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:17,784
and here we have another planet,
Saturn for example. 

25
00:01:19,904 --> 00:01:24,179
The Earth is of course at one
astronomical unit away from the Sun

26
00:01:24,179 --> 00:01:28,359
and Saturn, or any other planet,
is at a distance <i>d</i>.

27
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,694
We will now look
at the energy budget,

28
00:01:31,694 --> 00:01:34,454
what is the energy 
received by planets

29
00:01:34,454 --> 00:01:36,933
and what is the energy 
emitted by planets.

30
00:01:37,663 --> 00:01:40,552
First the energy received on Earth.

31
00:01:47,215 --> 00:01:50,866
The energy received
at the top of the atmosphere

32
00:01:54,992 --> 00:01:58,197
can be measured
for example by satellites

33
00:01:58,257 --> 00:02:01,169
and is called the
solar constant.

34
00:02:04,547 --> 00:02:08,028
The solar constant  <i>S</i>
is an energy flux,

35
00:02:08,028 --> 00:02:11,570
or more accurately a power flux,
the numerical value of which is :

36
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:16,179
1.37 · 10^6  erg / cm² s

37
00:02:18,009 --> 00:02:23,168
1.37 · 10^6  erg / cm² s

38
00:02:23,168 --> 00:02:24,959
since the solar energy is diluted, spread

39
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,203
over a sphere with a surface of <i>4π</i> 
 times the square of one astronomical unit.

40
00:02:29,203 --> 00:02:30,806
At a distance <i>d</i>,

41
00:02:34,507 --> 00:02:36,219
namely the distance <i>d</i> here,

42
00:02:38,609 --> 00:02:42,462
<i>S(d)</i> is the solar energy,

43
00:02:43,312 --> 00:02:46,355
<i>S</i> integrated on a 
sphere with a surface of <i>4π</i>

44
00:02:46,355 --> 00:02:48,939
times the square of one astronomical unit :

45
00:02:49,189 --> 00:02:52,768
<i>4π · d(Earth)</i>,

46
00:02:52,768 --> 00:02:55,697
so this is the square of
one astronomical unit,

47
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:59,087
and diluted on a sphere with
a surface of <i>4πd²</i>.

48
00:02:59,367 --> 00:03:03,671
We have then here <i> 1 / 4πd²</i>.

49
00:03:06,361 --> 00:03:10,379
Finally <i>S(d)</i> is simply a
rescaling of <i>S</i>

50
00:03:10,699 --> 00:03:11,799
by a factor
<i>(d(Earth)/d)²</i>

51
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:17,969
by a factor
<i>(d(Earth)/d)²</i>

52
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:22,409
We have just seen the
energy received by the Earth.

53
00:03:22,409 --> 00:03:25,898
Now let us have a look at the full
energy balance for the Earth.

54
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:30,241
We have some energy 
here that is absorbed,

55
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:32,731
which we just talked about.

56
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:35,674
It is the energy flux
coming from the Sun.

57
00:03:36,074 --> 00:03:40,398
We have some emitted energy

58
00:03:40,398 --> 00:03:42,660
which is the energy 
produced by the planet itself

59
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,255
for example due to radioactivity
in the mantle or the terrestrial crust.

60
00:03:46,255 --> 00:03:49,715
Finally there is some radiated energy.

61
00:03:50,155 --> 00:03:51,895
This radiated energy is

62
00:03:51,895 --> 00:03:55,175
due to the black body radiation.

63
00:03:55,175 --> 00:03:58,725
<i>E_cn</i> here is a black body radiation.

64
00:03:58,725 --> 00:04:02,149
If we observe the Earth from
outside of the solar system

65
00:04:02,149 --> 00:04:05,705
and measure its spectrum, we
will see a black body spectrum.

66
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:07,933
What is now the energy balance?

67
00:04:08,253 --> 00:04:11,432
There is the solar flux which is
absorbed energy

68
00:04:11,952 --> 00:04:17,007
and there is energy emitted
directly by the Earth.

69
00:04:17,617 --> 00:04:20,605
Their sum must be equal to
the black body energy,

70
00:04:20,605 --> 00:04:24,139
the one we observe from
outside the solar system,

71
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:28,316
the energy that an outside 
observer would receive. 

72
00:04:28,626 --> 00:04:30,034
We rewrite the absorbed energy

73
00:04:31,744 --> 00:04:36,182
as a function of the solar constant.

74
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:40,152
It is equal to the solar constant

75
00:04:41,582 --> 00:04:45,001
times the Earth's cross section.

76
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:48,520
It is the energy received on Earth.

77
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,100
The Earth's cross section is <i>πR²</i>.

78
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:58,409
Obviously only a part of
the light is absorbed

79
00:04:58,409 --> 00:04:59,813
and the rest is reflected.

80
00:04:59,853 --> 00:05:02,799
We express this
with the factor <i>1-A</i>

81
00:05:03,119 --> 00:05:05,235
where <i>A</i> is called the albedo.

82
00:05:06,325 --> 00:05:11,839
If <i>A = 1</i> then all the
radiation is reflected

83
00:05:16,319 --> 00:05:19,856
and if <i>A = 0</i>
all of it is absorbed.

84
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:28,194
For the Earth, <i>A = 0,3</i>.

85
00:05:34,144 --> 00:05:38,422
So we have an absorbed radiation

86
00:05:39,522 --> 00:05:44,675
plus an emitted radiation, of
which we're going to talk later,

87
00:05:45,265 --> 00:05:48,142
equal to the black body radiation.

88
00:05:48,992 --> 00:05:51,858
As we just wrote, the
absorbed radiation is

89
00:05:51,978 --> 00:05:56,115
<i>π</i> times the radius of the Earth
squared, namely the cross section,

90
00:05:56,595 --> 00:05:59,837
times the solar constant,
times 1 minus the Albedo.

91
00:06:01,813 --> 00:06:07,168
The emitted radiation, which can
for example be produced

92
00:06:07,428 --> 00:06:10,432
by the liquid magma under the
terrestrial crust and its radioactivity,

93
00:06:10,752 --> 00:06:13,040
is the surface of the Earth,

94
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:17,442
<i>4 π · R(Earth)²</i>

95
00:06:17,922 --> 00:06:20,564
times <i>Q</i> the produced energy

96
00:06:20,564 --> 00:06:25,488
by this radioactivity, say 
at ground level.

97
00:06:25,698 --> 00:06:29,219
We can measure the value of <i>Q</i>

98
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:35,256
and find 0,06 W/m²
at ground level.

99
00:06:36,326 --> 00:06:37,643
and find 0,06 W/m²
at ground level.

100
00:06:40,313 --> 00:06:43,792
We multiply <i>Q</i> by the factor <i>4πR²</i>

101
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:46,803
to get the total energy emitted
by Earth at ground level.

102
00:06:47,453 --> 00:06:51,290
Now what about the energy radiated as
black body radiation.

103
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,365
As we saw in the lecture on
the black body,

104
00:06:54,715 --> 00:07:00,769
a black body emits an energy flux
depending on its temperature : <i>σT^4</i>.

105
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:08,420
So we have <i>σT^4</i>, T being the 
effective temperature of the black body.

106
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,105
We have to multiply this by the
total surface radiating this flux

107
00:07:14,105 --> 00:07:18,099
which is simply <i>4π</i> times
the Earth's radius squared.

108
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:21,510
This gives the complete
energy balance.

109
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:24,902
Let us rewrite this equation
in a slightly different manner.

110
00:07:25,162 --> 00:07:26,960
So we have :

111
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,889
the absorbed energy plus the emitted
energy is the black body energy.

112
00:07:36,309 --> 00:07:38,260
If we rearrange the different terms,

113
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:43,413
we end-up with the following equation.

114
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,495
So we have <i>4σT^4</i>,

115
00:07:51,495 --> 00:07:53,610
with T the effective temperature

116
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:56,025
which is actually the parameter
we are interested in,

117
00:07:56,715 --> 00:07:59,991
over <i>(1 - A) · S</i>.

118
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:02,715
For the Earth,

119
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:09,599
<i>A = 0,3</i>

120
00:08:09,979 --> 00:08:14,954
which means that 30% of
the light is reflected.

121
00:08:19,649 --> 00:08:22,079
We also had that <i>Q = 0.06 W/m²</i>

122
00:08:22,079 --> 00:08:27,439
We also had that <i>Q = 0.06 W/m²</i>

123
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,859
at the Earth's surface.

124
00:08:29,319 --> 00:08:34,579
The solar constant <i>S</i> 
on the terrestrial orbit is

125
00:08:34,579 --> 00:08:37,700
<i>S = 1,37 · 10^6</i> erg / cm² s

126
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:41,781
<i>S = 1,37 · 10^6</i> erg / cm² s

127
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:44,484
If we plug all these numbers
in this equation

128
00:08:44,844 --> 00:08:48,295
we get that the
black body temperature

129
00:08:48,795 --> 00:08:53,590
of the Earth is 255 K.

130
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:57,169
Note that this is the Earth's
black body effective temperature

131
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:59,126
and not the temperature
at ground level

132
00:08:59,126 --> 00:09:02,263
which is completely dominated
by the climatology,

133
00:09:02,263 --> 00:09:04,632
by Earth's atmosphere.

134
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:08,170
We just saw that the Earth
behaves like a black body.

135
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:14,652
We have the Earth
with an atmosphere

136
00:09:16,762 --> 00:09:18,225
acting as a filter. 

137
00:09:18,865 --> 00:09:24,299
We have on the one hand the 
incoming radiation from the Sun 

138
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,413
which is UV and visible light

139
00:09:27,943 --> 00:09:31,594
and on the other hand
the outgoing radiation

140
00:09:33,674 --> 00:09:35,235
which is infrared light

141
00:09:35,235 --> 00:09:38,897
since we have a black body
with a temperature of 255 K

142
00:09:38,897 --> 00:09:41,833
which peaks in the infrared domain.

143
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:44,452
On one side we have UV radiation.

144
00:09:44,522 --> 00:09:48,229
If I draw here the
emitted or received

145
00:09:48,569 --> 00:09:51,744
flux on Earth as a function
of the wavelength,

146
00:09:51,864 --> 00:09:54,081
we have a black body curve.

147
00:09:56,241 --> 00:09:58,187
So this is a black body
at a temperature of 5780 K,

148
00:09:58,187 --> 00:10:02,297
So this is a black body
at a temperature of 5780 K,

149
00:10:02,997 --> 00:10:04,137
namely the Sun.

150
00:10:05,997 --> 00:10:10,139
This is some radiation with a peak in
the UV/optical according to Wien's law

151
00:10:10,539 --> 00:10:12,043
and it is an incoming radiation.

152
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:15,869
We have therefore
an incoming UV/optical radiation

153
00:10:16,139 --> 00:10:18,274
which attempts to pass through
the Earth's atmosphere

154
00:10:18,274 --> 00:10:20,285
acting itself as a filter.

155
00:10:20,305 --> 00:10:23,291
The Earth itself, as we
just computed,

156
00:10:23,931 --> 00:10:25,938
emits black body radiation,

157
00:10:27,768 --> 00:10:29,880
with a curve of the same shape

158
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,734
but this time with a black
body temperature of 255 K.

159
00:10:31,734 --> 00:10:36,858
but this time with a black
body temperature of 255 K.

160
00:10:37,698 --> 00:10:42,694
The Earth emits then
in the infrared domain,

161
00:10:42,774 --> 00:10:45,152
and this is an outgoing radiation.

162
00:10:47,492 --> 00:10:50,735
What happens in the atmosphere ?

163
00:10:50,735 --> 00:10:55,674
We show here as a function of
the altitude and of the wavelength

164
00:10:56,124 --> 00:10:59,354
the different filters blocking the
several kinds of radiation.

165
00:10:59,684 --> 00:11:03,979
First in the upper atmosphere,
at an altitude of 10km,

166
00:11:07,449 --> 00:11:12,084
First in the upper atmosphere,
at an altitude of 10km,

167
00:11:12,611 --> 00:11:16,284
we have water molecules

168
00:11:17,934 --> 00:11:20,177
and ozone molecules.

169
00:11:23,437 --> 00:11:27,081
At ground level, up to a few hundred metres

170
00:11:29,471 --> 00:11:34,254
or a few kilometres high,

171
00:11:34,324 --> 00:11:38,963
we have CO2 particles

172
00:11:39,013 --> 00:11:41,719
as well as of course some water.

173
00:11:43,099 --> 00:11:45,119
There is also water
quite high in the atmosphere.

174
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:47,127
There is also water
quite high in the atmosphere.

175
00:11:47,127 --> 00:11:51,645
It can be water created by the
burning of kerosene

176
00:11:51,645 --> 00:11:52,874
by the engines of airplanes.

177
00:11:52,904 --> 00:11:55,457
So here we have water
produced by airplanes

178
00:11:58,287 --> 00:12:00,460
and water naturally present
at ground level.

179
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:05,846
On the ground, the CO2 is
partly caused by cars.

180
00:12:06,496 --> 00:12:09,594
There is here an ozone layer,

181
00:12:09,594 --> 00:12:13,026
that CFC can destroy.

182
00:12:13,951 --> 00:12:15,930
If we consider all of
these together, we have :

183
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:22,498
UV light that enters the atmosphere

184
00:12:22,498 --> 00:12:25,189
which would be blocked
by the ozone layer

185
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:31,029
but if the ozone has been destroyed
it cannot filter this radiation.

186
00:12:31,939 --> 00:12:33,939
If the ozone has been destroyed,

187
00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:37,171
the UV radiation can penetrate
all the way to the ground level

188
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:41,384
because there are no more
natural filters.

189
00:12:41,384 --> 00:12:43,379
UV light is blocked by ozone.

190
00:12:43,379 --> 00:12:45,809
If the ozone layer is destroyed,
UV radiation can enter the atmosphere

191
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:48,370
and thus contribute to
warming the Earth.

192
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:50,422
This obviously applies

193
00:12:50,422 --> 00:12:52,057
to any other planet

194
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:54,538
which has incoming and
outgoing radiation

195
00:12:54,538 --> 00:12:57,150
with several filters either at
ground level or at high altitude.

196
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:00,109
We have then UV light
blocked by ozone,

197
00:13:00,109 --> 00:13:02,944
which is not blocked if the ozone
layer has been destroyed,

198
00:13:02,944 --> 00:13:06,211
and we have an infrared
outgoing radiation.

199
00:13:06,211 --> 00:13:09,248
This outgoing radiation could
naturally escape

200
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:12,775
if there was no filter
such as CO2

201
00:13:12,775 --> 00:13:17,665
which indeed blocks infrared.

202
00:13:17,665 --> 00:13:21,557
As a result there is less outgoing
radiation than there should

203
00:13:21,557 --> 00:13:24,903
and some energy is
retained at ground level

204
00:13:24,903 --> 00:13:28,980
by this CO2, as well as by 
the water at high altitude,

205
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:32,240
water also being an infrared filter.

206
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:35,215
Water is naturally found at ground level

207
00:13:35,365 --> 00:13:39,575
but not at high altitude.

208
00:13:40,365 --> 00:13:44,244
Water ejected by the burning of 
kerosene by airplane motors 

209
00:13:44,624 --> 00:13:49,155
acts like a filter blocking the
outgoing infrared radiation.

210
00:13:49,485 --> 00:13:54,023
This shows that the
climate we know on Earth

211
00:13:54,023 --> 00:13:55,795
and the greenhouse effect on Earth

212
00:13:55,795 --> 00:13:58,365
are due to the Sun's temperature,

213
00:13:58,365 --> 00:14:01,774
the Earth's black body radiation,

214
00:14:02,094 --> 00:14:05,746
and the chemical composition
of the atmosphere,

215
00:14:05,746 --> 00:14:08,866
which is either natural or
artificially altered by mankind

216
00:14:08,996 --> 00:14:10,833
and sets up a
number of filters

217
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,737
blocking incoming
or outgoing radiation.

218
00:14:13,767 --> 00:14:17,387
There is a natural equilibrium
unless any change is imposed by human activities.

219
00:14:17,387 --> 00:14:22,128
This equilibrium can be broken
for example by adding filters here,

220
00:14:22,128 --> 00:14:23,531
water and CO2

221
00:14:23,531 --> 00:14:25,900
or by destroying filters
protecting it

222
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,339
from the incoming
ultraviolet radiation.

223
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,827
Let us see a few numbers
about the influences

224
00:14:31,827 --> 00:14:33,713
on the surface
temperature of a planet.

225
00:14:34,093 --> 00:14:37,074
If we take Venus, the Earth
and Mars as example,

226
00:14:37,074 --> 00:14:40,838
we see that the solar constant
decreases with the distance

227
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:43,148
but not the black
body temperatures

228
00:14:43,148 --> 00:14:45,614
due to the quite different
albedos of the planets

229
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:48,678
and due to the small amount
of intrisic energy produced.

230
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:51,914
However the surface
temperature varies heavily

231
00:14:51,914 --> 00:14:53,870
due to the presence
of an atmosphere

232
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:56,215
regulating the energy fluxes

233
00:14:56,215 --> 00:14:58,769
between the planet and
the rest of the Universe.
