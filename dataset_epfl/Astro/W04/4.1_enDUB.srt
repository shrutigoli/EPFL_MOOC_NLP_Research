1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,040
In extreme cases the tidal forces
can distort the shape of celestial bodies

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,130
up to the point of breaking them.
Some planetary rings such as Saturn's,

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,960
seen here by NASA's Cassini probe,
may be the result of the destruction of a

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,650
satellite
under the effect of tidal forces.

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:22,250
We will see here that there is a limit in
the

6
00:00:22,250 --> 00:00:24,740
distance between two bodies before one of
them breaks

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,400
under the effect of the tidal forces from
the other.

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,130
This distance is known as the « Roche limit
»

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:34,330
from the French astronomer Edouard Roche
who first performed the calculation in the

10
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:37,700
19th century.
Let us compute the Roche limit,

11
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:43,479
the distance at which a satellite is destroyed
under the effect of the tidal forces exerted

12
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,180
by a planet.
Let us consider a planet

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:51,470
of a given radius R.
Here is Jupiter as an example.

14
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:56,820
We assume it has a constant density ρ_M.
We also consider a satellite,

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,580
"Io" for example, or any other satellite
which has a given density ρ_m and a given

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:09,590
radius r.
The two bodies are at a distance d

17
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:14,330
from each other.
We saw in the last chapter

18
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:20,740
that we have tidal forces exerted on the points
a and b here.

19
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:25,390
These are differential forces
due to the gradient of the gravitational field

20
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:29,440
of Jupiter through the satellite,
namely Io in this example.

21
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:35,620
The tidal forces are equal with opposed signs.
We have a force here on B

22
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:41,920
and another one here on A.
Both forces are stretching the satellite.

23
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,550
We previously found that the tidal force,
when neglecting the rotation of the satellite

24
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:51,690
around Jupiter,
exerted either on B or on A,

25
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:57,510
has the same value,
is equal to 2GM / d³, with d the distance

26
00:01:57,510 --> 00:02:02,330
between the two bodies,
time the radius of the smallest object.

27
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:05,470
This is the expression of the tidal forces
when neglecting

28
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:12,190
the rotation of the satellite around the planet.
What happens when we do not neglect the orbital

29
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:22,070
motion of the satellite any more?
The angular velocity is given by 2 π / P,

30
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:25,550
where the orbital period P is given by Kepler's
laws.

31
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,959
We have a centripetal acceleration
at the three points here

32
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:38,720
at the centre and at the edges of the satellite.
This centripetal acceleration is a = ω ²r

33
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:45,110
where r is the distance between the centre
of Jupiter

34
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:50,980
and each point we are considering.
We had the points A and B there

35
00:02:50,980 --> 00:03:00,819
as well as the centre C of the satellite.
Let us consider the different forces.

36
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:06,630
There is first the centripetal acceleration.
On the closest

37
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:12,650
point to Jupiter, A, it is smaller
than on the other points,

38
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:23,819
such as C here or B there.
The acceleration on A is ω² ( d - r)

39
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:37,470
At the 
centre we have an acceleration ω² d

40
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:40,520
since the centre is at a distance d from the
centre of Jupiter

41
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:44,580
and on B the centripetal acceleration is
ω² (d+r)

42
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:49,760
We have thus a centripetal acceleration to
the centre of Jupiter

43
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,940
We have thus a centripetal acceleration to
the centre of Jupiter

44
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:59,269
At each point on the surface of the satellite
is felt a pseudo force

45
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:05,849
in particular at the points A, B
and C the centre of the satellite.

46
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:15,780
So we have like previously A, B and C.
The pseudo force is in the opposite direction

47
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:20,310
with a norm equal to the norm of the centripetal
force.

48
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:24,409
We have thus a small vector here on A, a bigger
vector here on C

49
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:29,460
and an even bigger one on B
such that the norm of the different accelerations

50
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:35,330
are the ones we wrote previously.
We now want to compute the differential acceleration

51
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:40,719
at the points A and B
relative to the acceleration at point C.

52
00:04:40,719 --> 00:04:47,069
To this purpose we subtract, at A, B and C,
the centripetal acceleration, or the pseudo

53
00:04:47,069 --> 00:04:50,939
force felt at C.
We add a vector with the same norm as this

54
00:04:50,939 --> 00:04:55,289
one at C
but with opposed direction.

55
00:04:55,289 --> 00:04:59,189
We have then a first arrow at C here and another
one at B there

56
00:04:59,189 --> 00:05:03,919
such that they have the same norm.
and a last one at A there with again the same

57
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,460
norm.
We add the two vectors at each point

58
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:15,199
and we get the resulting force.
Here at B we have a force roughly like that,

59
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:23,349
at the centre we have obviously zero
and at A the resulting force is in this direction.

60
00:05:23,349 --> 00:05:29,460
We are now interested in computing
the norm of these two green arrows.

61
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,860
Let us first write the norm of the green arrow
at point B.

62
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:48,069
The acceleration at point B is
ω² (d+r)- ω² d

63
00:05:48,069 --> 00:05:52,979
which is simply the difference
between the white and the red arrows, so finally

64
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:58,469
= ω² r.
The third Kepler law tells us that

65
00:05:58,469 --> 00:06:12,430
d³ / P² = G M
where M is the mass of the most massive body,

66
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:21,930
over 4π², with ω = 2π / P, P being the
orbital period.

67
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:32,559
From there we deduce that ω² = GM / d³
that we inject here in order to get the acceleration

68
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:42,339
at point B.
It is equal to (G M / d³) * r

69
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:47,110
As we've seen before, the tidal acceleration
at point b,

70
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:50,629
caused by the gradient of the gravitational
force

71
00:06:50,629 --> 00:07:03,949
through the satellite, equals
(2GM / d³) * r .

72
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:09,210
We thus have an effect of differential rotation.
The differential acceleration caused by the

73
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:11,460
rotation
of the satellite around the planet

74
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:18,130
which is equal to half the tidal force
and as such is by no means insignificant.

75
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:23,069
Now let us summarize what we computed.
We still have our two points A and B. We will

76
00:07:23,069 --> 00:07:27,909
look in greater details
what happens at point B.

77
00:07:27,909 --> 00:07:33,419
We have our satellite with a radius r
and we have several forces. We have first

78
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:39,699
the tidal force
that we computed in the previous video,

79
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:46,860
the differential acceleration
which is half of this force there

80
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:55,149
and in the other direction we have
the g of the satellite.

81
00:07:55,149 --> 00:08:09,409
So here is the tidal acceleration
which is equal to (2GM / d³) * r.

82
00:08:09,409 --> 00:08:16,649
We have the centripetal acceleration we just
computed,

83
00:08:16,649 --> 00:08:26,789
which is equal to (GM / d³) * r.
The satellite is torn apart

84
00:08:26,789 --> 00:08:39,330
if the norm of the sum of
a_M + the tidal acceleration,

85
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:44,070
so the sum of the two forces,
is greater than the norm of the gravitational

86
00:08:44,070 --> 00:08:48,260
field
which holds the satellite together.

87
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:51,280
If the sum of these two accelerations is greater
than g

88
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:55,060
then the satellite is destroyed.
Let us write it as equations :

89
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:09,520
(3 GM / d³) * r > Gm
where m is the mass of the satellite,

90
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:14,250
over r², its radius.
This term is the gravitational field at the

91
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,390
surface of the satellite.
To simplify we will assume

92
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:26,370
that m = 4/3 π r³ * ρ_m, ro_m being the
satellite density.

93
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,440
With the same assumption, the mass of the
planet, Jupiter here,

94
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:41,220
is : M = 4/3 π R³ * ρ_M.
We consider ρ to be constant.

95
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:48,300
If we plug m and M in this equation here
we will find the critical distance we are

96
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,700
interested in :
d_Roche = 1.4 times the ratio of the densities

97
00:09:53,700 --> 00:10:00,090
of the two bodies,
to the power 1/3, times the radius of the

98
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:04,260
larger body,
Jupiter in this case.

99
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:08,550
This is an approximation
that does not take into account the internal

100
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,000
cohesive forces
If we make an exact calculation, we would

101
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:16,200
find here
a factor 2.5.

102
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,340
This distance, d_Roche, is the one we have
to inject in this equation here

103
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:25,550
to have an equality.
If the distance is smaller, the satellite

104
00:10:25,550 --> 00:10:28,390
is torn apart
by the combined effect of tidal forces

105
00:10:28,390 --> 00:10:33,030
and centripetal acceleration caused by the
planet.

106
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:35,740
Let us come back to the planet Saturn.
The rings you see here

107
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:40,890
are the result of the break-up of a body
that crossed the Roche limit and broke

108
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,450
under the effect of the tidal forces from
Saturn.

109
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:48,850
But all the rings don't have the same origin.
The external ring, the E ring of Saturn, slightly

110
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:52,690
blurred on this picture
taken by the Cassini space probe

111
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:55,600
is actually created by the extreme volcanic
activity

112
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,820
of a satellite of Saturn, Enceladus.
The plumes that you see going out of the satellite

113
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:04,780
are composed of water vapour
heated partly by the friction

114
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,940
of matter in the internal mantle of the satellite
under the effect of tidal forces from Saturn.

115
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,500
Part of the water vapour is ejected to the
orbit

116
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:18,250
of the satellite with some dust.
The process creates a wide ring

117
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,730
materializing the orbit of Enceladus around
Saturn.

118
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:24,530
In the solar system, the bodies most affected
by the

119
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:29,051
Roche limit are probably the comets.
They travel at high speed through the whole

120
00:11:29,051 --> 00:11:33,150
solar system
and therefore get often quite close to strong

121
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,330
gravitational fields
such as Jupiter's or the Sun's.

122
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:41,610
In both cases the comets can be destroyed
if they cross the Roche limit.

123
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:44,790
This is what happened to the comet Shoemaker-Levy
9

124
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:49,382
getting too close to Jupiter in may 1994.
The comet broke up in 21 pieces

125
00:11:49,382 --> 00:11:50,750
clearly visible on this picture taken by the
Hubble space telescope

126
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,500
clearly visible on this picture taken by the
Hubble space telescope

127
00:11:54,500 --> 00:12:00,170
where we see debris spreading over a distance
of more or less 1 million kilometres.

128
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:02,250
Three months later these debris came back
to Jupiter

129
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:07,300
and eventually crashed on the surface, on
16th July 1994.

130
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,470
Several impacts were visible on the planet's
surface

131
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,121
for several days.
Some impact marks even reached the size of

132
00:12:13,121 --> 00:12:13,131
the Earth.
