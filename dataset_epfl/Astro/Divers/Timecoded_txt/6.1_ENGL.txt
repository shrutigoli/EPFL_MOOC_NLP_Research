1
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,100
In this lecture we will have a look 
at larger scales

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:09,257
and explore
the world of galaxies.

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,494
Here is one of the most beautiful 
illustration of the diversity of galaxies -

4
00:00:12,717 --> 00:00:15,207
the Hubble Ultra Deep 
Field.

5
00:00:15,207 --> 00:00:18,055
that we already saw before.

6
00:00:18,055 --> 00:00:21,843
It reveals all sorts of galaxies
up to faint (large) magnitudes

7
00:00:21,843 --> 00:00:24,659
so it shows very distant galaxies 
that emit little light.

8
00:00:24,659 --> 00:00:27,712
It is possible to see galaxies 
up to a magnitude of 29.

9
00:00:27,712 --> 00:00:31,978
The image consists of about 10 000
galaxies within an area of about

10
00:00:31,978 --> 00:00:35,949
one hundredth of the surface of the Full Moon.

11
00:00:36,275 --> 00:00:39,338
Each of those galaxies
contains from about 100 millions 

12
00:00:39,338 --> 00:00:40,983
to 100 billions of stars.

13
00:00:41,296 --> 00:00:44,760
We live in one of some
80 billions of galaxies

14
00:00:44,828 --> 00:00:47,403
that populate the Universe:
the Milky Way.

15
00:00:47,403 --> 00:00:51,721
In this video we will look at the various types of galaxies,

16
00:00:51,721 --> 00:00:54,111
how to study them,

17
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:56,640
and how to understand
their formation process.

18
00:00:57,126 --> 00:00:59,809
Let's see how galaxies
are characterised

19
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:02,439
through the Hubble sequence.

20
00:01:02,439 --> 00:01:07,558
This is a sequence proposed by the
American astronomer Edwin Hubble

21
00:01:07,558 --> 00:01:10,241
at the beginning of the
20th century.

22
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:13,072
The Hubble Space Telescope
and the Hubble law

23
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:16,678
were named after 
the same astronomer.

24
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:20,716
So Hubble established 
the evolutionary sequence

25
00:01:20,716 --> 00:01:22,808
which in fact, as it will be shown
later, is not evolutionary.

26
00:01:22,808 --> 00:01:25,664
This is just a morphological
sequence describing the galaxies.

27
00:01:26,233 --> 00:01:28,584
There are essentially
two types of galaxies:

28
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:32,631
elliptical and spiral galaxies.

29
00:01:32,631 --> 00:01:37,068
In between, there is an intermediate
type - the lenticular galaxies.

30
00:01:37,068 --> 00:01:38,163
What is going on
in this sequence?

31
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:40,518
The elliptical galaxies,  
as the name indicates,

32
00:01:40,518 --> 00:01:44,122
have an elliptical form and they 
generally consist of old stars

33
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:47,118
with random orbits 

34
00:01:47,118 --> 00:01:48,932
around a common gravity centre.

35
00:01:48,932 --> 00:01:55,278
"E" stands for elliptical, then there
are 7 possibilities for the ellipticity.

36
00:01:55,278 --> 00:02:01,281
The type of an elliptical galaxy can be 
written as E with an index n

37
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:05,755
that is equal to (1 - A/B ) * 10,

38
00:02:05,795 --> 00:02:08,755
where A/B is the ratio of 
the semi-major axis

39
00:02:08,755 --> 00:02:11,199
and the semi-minor axis.

40
00:02:11,472 --> 00:02:14,756
The ellipticity 0 indicates
a circular galaxy

41
00:02:14,756 --> 00:02:17,826
while 7 inclides the most 
elliptical galaxies.

42
00:02:17,826 --> 00:02:21,793
The spiral galaxies

43
00:02:21,793 --> 00:02:25,474
form large spiral arms.

44
00:02:25,474 --> 00:02:31,681
Those galaxies are seen face-on.
Seen edge-on they would show a disk component. 

45
00:02:31,681 --> 00:02:33,635
Some examples will be shown in a moment.

46
00:02:33,635 --> 00:02:41,245
There are two groups 
of spiral galaxies.

47
00:02:41,245 --> 00:02:47,249
In general, S stands for spiral, then
the indices a, b and c depend on

48
00:02:47,249 --> 00:02:52,922
the importance of the bulge 
compared to the spiral arms of the galaxy

49
00:02:52,922 --> 00:02:55,984
and the opening of the 
spiral structure.

50
00:02:55,984 --> 00:02:58,987
Going form a to c 
there are less spiral arms 

51
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:01,135
and they are less wrapped 
around each other.

52
00:03:01,135 --> 00:03:04,547
Spiral galaxies,

53
00:03:04,556 --> 00:03:09,323
as  was said before, have a bulge

54
00:03:09,323 --> 00:03:11,985
that can be seen in the centre.

55
00:03:11,985 --> 00:03:13,973
They also have a disk.

56
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:17,829
It is in the flat disk, 
seen face on here,

57
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:20,069
that the spiral arms form.

58
00:03:20,069 --> 00:03:25,117
There is also a dark matter halo.

59
00:03:25,117 --> 00:03:27,452
The elliptical galaxies 
as well have a halo

60
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:31,261
which by definition cannot be seen
as it is formed of dark matter.

61
00:03:31,261 --> 00:03:35,484
The halo will be discussed
in the next videos.

62
00:03:35,484 --> 00:03:39,144
The lenticular galaxies were also mentioned.

63
00:03:39,144 --> 00:03:44,628
One can say that those are elliptical
galaxies but possesing a disk

64
00:03:44,641 --> 00:03:46,971
through which one can even 
see dust.

65
00:03:46,971 --> 00:03:49,864
Those galaxies can be compared to 
the spiral galaxies

66
00:03:49,864 --> 00:03:53,277
with a large bulge that has the size
of an elliptical galaxy.

67
00:03:53,277 --> 00:03:58,026
As it was said before, 
the Hubble sequence is not evolutionary.

68
00:03:58,026 --> 00:04:02,352
Hubble created this sequence assuming that

69
00:04:02,352 --> 00:04:06,678
galaxies form as elliptical galaxies,

70
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:11,004
then they evolve progressively 
toward galaxies with spiral arms

71
00:04:11,004 --> 00:04:15,089
either wrapped 
around each other

72
00:04:15,089 --> 00:04:18,317
or wrapped around a bar.

73
00:04:18,317 --> 00:04:20,838
Here we show barred spiral galaxies,

74
00:04:21,437 --> 00:04:25,946
they are named using a
S for spiral,

75
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:30,636
B for barred and then 
the index a, b or c

76
00:04:30,636 --> 00:04:36,590
which tells us how the spiral arms
are wrapped around the bulge

77
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:39,174
and the bar in this case.

78
00:04:39,174 --> 00:04:41,239
Back to the evolutionary sequence

79
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:44,104
which is not evolutionary

80
00:04:44,104 --> 00:04:47,237
as the elliptical galaxies do not
evolve into spiral galaxies,

81
00:04:47,237 --> 00:04:48,466
as it was thought by Hubble.

82
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:50,432
This is a mere morphological sequence.

83
00:04:50,432 --> 00:04:56,440
Be careful here, the Hubble sequence
is a morphological sequence.

84
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,934
Here are some examples of
various types of galaxies.

85
00:05:02,934 --> 00:05:06,661
Starting with an elliptical galaxy
that is quite featureless

86
00:05:06,661 --> 00:05:09,920
surrounded by a group 
of other galaxies.

87
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:13,295
This particular galaxy

88
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:17,012
lies at the centre of a galaxy cluster
in which the galaxies orbit 

89
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:19,129
about a centre of mass.

90
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:24,191
Another example,
this time a spiral galaxy, Messier 104

91
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:29,726
that is a magnificent example
of a spiral galaxy Sa with a prominent bulge

92
00:05:29,726 --> 00:05:34,530
that extends almost over the entire galaxy,
a disk is seen inclined

93
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:37,648
in the line of sight and is 
materialized 

94
00:05:37,648 --> 00:05:40,726
by the line of dust
across the galaxy.

95
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:43,440
As it was shown in the previous videos,

96
00:05:43,662 --> 00:05:45,118
dust absorbs the background light.

97
00:05:45,118 --> 00:05:47,967
This is the reason why
one can see the stellar light 

98
00:05:47,967 --> 00:05:50,843
that is absorbed by the dust
in the galactic disk.

99
00:05:50,843 --> 00:05:54,874
Another fascinating spiral galaxy,
Messier 101, 

100
00:05:54,874 --> 00:05:59,734
seen face on, with large spiral arms
expanding from the centre

101
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:04,782
to the outer parts of the galaxy.
One can clearly see the difference with Messier 104,

102
00:06:04,782 --> 00:06:07,768
the bulge that this time is much smaller

103
00:06:07,768 --> 00:06:11,845
as Messier 101 is a Sb type galaxy
rather than Sa.

104
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:17,324
Finally, a barred spiral galaxy
NGC 1300, and as its name indicates

105
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:21,568
it shows a bar that is placed

106
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:24,712
in the plane of the galactic disk.
Like the disks,

107
00:06:24,712 --> 00:06:29,010
bulges consists of stars, gas and dust.

108
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:32,829
Let's look in detail at
the various types of galaxies.

109
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,145
Starting with the elliptical galaxies.

110
00:06:34,145 --> 00:06:37,169
One can be seen here, in the centre 
of a galaxy cluster.

111
00:06:37,169 --> 00:06:39,393
Quite often elliptical galaxies lie in the centre
of a cluster, but not always.

112
00:06:39,393 --> 00:06:41,040
What is the mass range of
the elliptical galaxies?

113
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:44,475
Typically 10^7 solar masses
for less massive,

114
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:47,798
up to 10^13 solar masses
for the most massive galaxies.

115
00:06:47,798 --> 00:06:51,430
The most massive elliptical galaxies
often, but not always,

116
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:54,040
lie in the centre of 
a galaxy cluster.

117
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:58,398
They consist of old stellar populations,

118
00:06:58,398 --> 00:07:01,643
i.e of the age of about billions of years.

119
00:07:01,643 --> 00:07:06,257
There is little or no gas or dust,

120
00:07:10,077 --> 00:07:13,920
so the interstellar medium
is quite poor.

121
00:07:14,243 --> 00:07:17,801
There is a little star formation,

122
00:07:19,447 --> 00:07:23,073
stars are old with random orbits

123
00:07:23,073 --> 00:07:25,679
around the centre of mass.

124
00:07:25,679 --> 00:07:29,640
Taking the cross section
of a galaxy

125
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:34,819
in such a way, one can define 
the light profile.

126
00:07:34,819 --> 00:07:38,922
y axis represents the flux F,
x axis the radius of a galaxy.

127
00:07:38,922 --> 00:07:44,058
This is a typical light profile 
of an elliptical galaxy -

128
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:47,882
de Vaucouleurs profile,

129
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:51,068
after the astronomer 
that defined this profile.

130
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:56,800
The flux as a function of radius
is equal to

131
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:03,440
a normalisation constant times
exp - [ ( r / re )^1/4 -1 ].

132
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,439
This is a typical light profile
of elliptical galaxies.

133
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:11,063
<i>re</i> is the effective radius,

134
00:08:11,093 --> 00:08:14,014
i.e. the radius that 
contains half 

135
00:08:14,116 --> 00:08:16,080
the total light of a galaxy.

136
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,920
Let's take a look
at the spiral galaxies.

137
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,957
In spiral galaxies

138
00:08:20,957 --> 00:08:25,880
there is a disk and
extending spiral arms.

139
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:29,118
Here we have a Sab galaxy,
a type intermediate between a and b,

140
00:08:29,118 --> 00:08:32,108
the galaxy Messier 101 seen face on.

141
00:08:32,108 --> 00:08:37,513
The mass range is different 
for spiral galaxies.

142
00:08:37,513 --> 00:08:40,380
The least massive spiral galaxies
are more massive than

143
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:42,254
the least massive elliptical galaxies. 

144
00:08:42,254 --> 00:08:45,487
However, the most massive spiral galaxies
are less massive than the most massive elliptical galaxies,

145
00:08:45,487 --> 00:08:48,858
10^12 solar masses instead of
10^13 solar masses

146
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:51,493
as it was for elliptical galaxies.

147
00:08:51,493 --> 00:08:54,148
The sizes are also valid for 
the elliptical galaxies,

148
00:08:54,148 --> 00:08:56,481
even if the elliptical galaxies are in general
a little bit larger,

149
00:08:56,481 --> 00:09:02,642
i.e. about 40 kiloparsec in diameter.

150
00:09:02,642 --> 00:09:05,796
This limit is not quite precise

151
00:09:05,796 --> 00:09:09,440
as around the bulge 
and the spiral arms

152
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,757
there is a dark matter halo
that is not visible

153
00:09:11,757 --> 00:09:15,280
but the size of which can be
estimated indirectly.

154
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:20,777
In spiral galaxies there is 
a lot of gas and dust

155
00:09:20,777 --> 00:09:24,276
from which stars form.

156
00:09:24,276 --> 00:09:28,160
There are young stellar populations

157
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,156
and a lot of star formation.

158
00:09:31,156 --> 00:09:34,915
In fact, there are two
components of the stellar populations.

159
00:09:34,915 --> 00:09:41,480
The bulge consists of 
older, less massive stars,

160
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:45,004
the reddish colour implies
that the peak in the black body 

161
00:09:45,007 --> 00:09:46,814
distribution is in the red part.

162
00:09:46,814 --> 00:09:51,998
The spiral arms 
consist of young, 

163
00:09:51,998 --> 00:09:55,630
more massive stars that
radiate in the blue part of the spectrum.

164
00:09:55,630 --> 00:10:00,040
What is the light profile
of spiral galaxies?

165
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:02,273
Let's take the cross section
as before

166
00:10:02,273 --> 00:10:05,602
and look at the 
luminosity profile

167
00:10:05,602 --> 00:10:08,228
starting from the centre.

168
00:10:08,228 --> 00:10:10,464
There would be 
two components.

169
00:10:10,464 --> 00:10:16,515
The disk component curve, so, the
flux as a function of radius,

170
00:10:16,515 --> 00:10:21,348
is an exponential curve

171
00:10:21,348 --> 00:10:28,278
F = F0 e^(-R/h),

172
00:10:28,278 --> 00:10:32,677
where h is the characteristic 
height of the disk.

173
00:10:32,677 --> 00:10:36,807
This is the luminosity profile
of the galactic disk.

174
00:10:36,807 --> 00:10:41,758
On this curve there will be superimposed
the second component: the bulge.

175
00:10:41,758 --> 00:10:48,887
Its profile is obviously the
de Vaucouleurs profile,

176
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:54,701
the same that characterised
elliptical galaxies

177
00:10:54,936 --> 00:10:55,989
as it was seen before.

178
00:10:55,989 --> 00:10:59,516
This is another spiral galaxy,
this time seen edge on.

179
00:10:59,516 --> 00:11:03,758
If one takes a cross section
through the disk,

180
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:06,745
with the flux on the y axis 
and the radius on the x axis,

181
00:11:06,995 --> 00:11:10,680
one will find the curve
of the same type,

182
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:13,206
an exponential curve 
with h

183
00:11:13,206 --> 00:11:15,407
as a caracteristic height.

184
00:11:15,407 --> 00:11:19,367
Taking the cross section at this point, the resulting 
curve will be the sum of the de Vaucouleurs profile

185
00:11:19,367 --> 00:11:23,067
that is characteristic for a bulge
or an elliptical galaxy,

186
00:11:23,647 --> 00:11:25,557
and a disk component.

187
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:29,882
In this case, the measurements 
are affected by dust

188
00:11:29,942 --> 00:11:32,963
in the galactic plane. If our measurements 
were not affected by dust,

189
00:11:33,215 --> 00:11:39,600
the luminosity profile of a spiral galaxy
taken either perpendicularly

190
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:45,759
or along the disk
would be an exponential function.

191
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:48,637
What are the means 
that can be used

192
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:50,467
to study those galaxies
in details?

193
00:11:50,467 --> 00:11:55,512
There are two ways: through spectra
or imaging.

194
00:11:55,512 --> 00:12:01,240
Starting with imaging.
This is the bulge of a spiral galaxy

195
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,281
Messier 83, Sab galaxy. 

196
00:12:08,451 --> 00:12:11,366
This bulge is caracterised by the 
de Vaucouleurs luminosity profile. 

197
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,634
Then, there is also a disk component
with a fraction of dust

198
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:17,567
that is seen in absorption.

199
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:19,875
This is a false colour image

200
00:12:20,084 --> 00:12:23,149
taken with three different filters.

201
00:12:23,225 --> 00:12:28,199
The first one is the H-alpha filter
that shows the gas

202
00:12:28,199 --> 00:12:34,280
ionized by massive hot stars 
that are being formed.

203
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:38,952
If one is interested in the zones
of the star formation

204
00:12:38,952 --> 00:12:44,313
one should look at the red areas
whose spectrum can be 

205
00:12:44,458 --> 00:12:51,120
presented on a diagram of the flux 
as a function of the wavelength.

206
00:12:51,206 --> 00:12:57,431
Typical spectrum of those areas is the black body 
spectrum with the peak in the blue part

207
00:12:57,431 --> 00:13:05,544
as young, hot, massive stars emit most of the radiation 
in the blue; then, here we would observe the H-α emission line.

208
00:13:06,111 --> 00:13:08,052
This image was taken using three filters:

209
00:13:08,052 --> 00:13:12,838
blue, intermediate colour
and the H-α filter

210
00:13:12,838 --> 00:13:15,235
that enables us to see these zones

211
00:13:15,235 --> 00:13:20,346
that are of the size of the
Strömgren sphere 

212
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,410
which was presented in the lecture
on the interstellar medium.

213
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:28,341
It is interesting to take a closer look
at the Hα emission

214
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:31,480
of the gas ionized by young stars.

215
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:35,410
Previously, in the lecture concerning 
the colour-magnitude diagram

216
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:38,022
it was shown that the stellar 
populations can be characterised 

217
00:13:38,022 --> 00:13:40,648
by referring to the
colour-magnitude diagram.

218
00:13:40,648 --> 00:13:45,162
This can be done in the different
parts of a galaxy,

219
00:13:45,162 --> 00:13:51,848
for example in this area 
with some young stars.

220
00:13:53,918 --> 00:13:55,772
Such a colour-magnitude diagram
can be created

221
00:13:55,849 --> 00:13:57,530
using very high resolution images 

222
00:13:57,530 --> 00:14:00,010
taken by the Hubble telescope, for example.

223
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:03,310
One places the flux and 
colour of all the stars

224
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:06,308
from a chosen area on
the colour-magnitude diagram.

225
00:14:06,308 --> 00:14:08,999
Then, the main sequence might be visible, 
maybe some other structure,

226
00:14:08,999 --> 00:14:12,309
but in any case there is a possibility
of characterising the stellar populations

227
00:14:12,309 --> 00:14:14,716
that can be found 
in the marked area.

228
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:18,023
Proceeding in the same way for 
different regions in the galaxy,

229
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,630
it may be possible to trace back
the history of galaxy formation,

230
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:25,697
in any case the history of evolution
of the stellar populations in the galaxy.

231
00:14:25,697 --> 00:14:29,630
All this thanks to some simple 
measurements of the flux and colour

232
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:31,807
of stars in various regions
of the galaxy.

233
00:14:31,808 --> 00:14:35,795
If the image is taken at lower
resolution and the stars

234
00:14:35,795 --> 00:14:39,061
cannot be resolved in those
small areas, 

235
00:14:39,061 --> 00:14:40,894
it is no more possible to
use this method.

236
00:14:40,894 --> 00:14:44,798
In the previous image,
a spiral galaxy

237
00:14:44,798 --> 00:14:47,328
taken in three filters in the optical
domain was shown.

238
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:53,001
Obviously, the observations
can be made

239
00:14:53,001 --> 00:14:56,880
at much wider range of wavelengths.

240
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:01,522
This is Messier 31,

241
00:15:01,522 --> 00:15:04,720
the Andromeda galaxy
in the ultraviolet

242
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:07,456
and in the infrared light.

243
00:15:07,456 --> 00:15:12,695
One can see the spiral arms

244
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:15,329
and a part of the bulge
but it is more interesting

245
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:16,674
to take a look at the spiral arms

246
00:15:16,674 --> 00:15:22,568
that are well marked

247
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:24,677
by a great deal of bright points.

248
00:15:24,677 --> 00:15:29,279
In the ultraviolet we can see

249
00:15:31,369 --> 00:15:34,000
hot massive stars 

250
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:38,449
that ionize the surrounding gas
and so a lot of points can be seen

251
00:15:38,449 --> 00:15:41,043
in the Hα emission, 
as it was shown before.

252
00:15:41,043 --> 00:15:43,776
Looking at the
far infrared image, 

253
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,760
there is some dust and gas

254
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,138
 concentrated in the galactic disk

255
00:15:47,138 --> 00:15:50,749
of the spiral galaxy.

256
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:55,235
Dust absorbs photons

257
00:15:55,235 --> 00:16:00,669
coming from hot stars

258
00:16:00,669 --> 00:16:05,848
and then emits a modified
black body spectrum

259
00:16:05,848 --> 00:16:09,256
which peaks in the far infrared.

260
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:13,962
One can easily notice that
observing in the ultraviolet or infrared

261
00:16:13,962 --> 00:16:15,881
the same galaxy can give 
informations about various components.

262
00:16:15,881 --> 00:16:20,673
In the former case one observes young hot
massive stars in the process of formation,

263
00:16:20,673 --> 00:16:26,834
in the latter case one can 
directly see the dust.

264
00:16:26,915 --> 00:16:28,950
Obviously, both images are alike

265
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:32,160
as the stars heat the dust -

266
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,212
physically both components 

267
00:16:34,212 --> 00:16:36,181
are in the same place on the image.

268
00:16:36,181 --> 00:16:38,407
However, the physical processes
that are observed

269
00:16:38,407 --> 00:16:39,924
are not the same.

270
00:16:39,924 --> 00:16:44,954
A multiwavelength study
of celestial bodies,

271
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:49,488
in particular the galaxies, enables us 
to characterise the stellar populations,

272
00:16:49,488 --> 00:16:53,405
the gas contents, and to learn how 
those two elements are linked.

273
00:16:53,405 --> 00:16:56,955
Until now, we only studied the images,
but there is also another

274
00:16:56,955 --> 00:16:59,812
important tool that can be used -
the spectra.

275
00:16:59,812 --> 00:17:03,153
Those can be used to
measure the Doppler effect.

276
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:08,156
What can be seen here are
the Dopper maps of some galaxies.

277
00:17:08,156 --> 00:17:13,721
Colours indicate a radial 
velocity of the stars

278
00:17:13,844 --> 00:17:16,893
as a function of the position
in the galaxy.

279
00:17:16,893 --> 00:17:20,033
The red colour indicates

280
00:17:20,033 --> 00:17:25,119
the velocity that is directed away from us,

281
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,189
the blue colour indicates the velocity
directed toward us.

282
00:17:28,189 --> 00:17:31,520
Idem for this galaxy.

283
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:37,716
What can be measured is
the velocity of the galaxy

284
00:17:37,749 --> 00:17:40,875
as a function of the radius
which in turn is used for

285
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,843
the estimation of the galaxy's mass.  

286
00:17:42,843 --> 00:17:45,240
This subject will be treated later.

287
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:49,835
We can write the acceleration
of the points

288
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,154
along the rotation axis of a galaxy

289
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,681
as a function of mass.

290
00:17:54,681 --> 00:18:00,690
We have G*M(r)/r²,

291
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:04,429
that is the gravitational acceleration
is equal to v²/r.

292
00:18:04,429 --> 00:18:08,971
This implies that v equals
the square root of GM(r)/r.

293
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:13,584
One can see that if
the velocity at each point

294
00:18:13,861 --> 00:18:19,098
of the radius along the galaxy
is measured

295
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:22,149
it is possible to calculate the mass
within this radius.

296
00:18:22,318 --> 00:18:26,360
Once more the Doppler effect
turns out to be extremely useful,

297
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,670
this time it gives us the estimation 
of the mass of galaxies,

298
00:18:29,670 --> 00:18:34,600
the mass of luminous matter
as well as the mass of dark matter. 

299
00:18:34,984 --> 00:18:41,224
We have discussed various diagnostics
during this lecture: imaging, spectra

300
00:18:41,224 --> 00:18:43,775
and the morphological classification.

301
00:18:43,775 --> 00:18:47,441
This morphological classification
is not just to classify the objects

302
00:18:47,441 --> 00:18:48,955
it is very useful to astrophysicists. 

303
00:18:48,955 --> 00:18:54,237
The morphological classification
changes with the distance.

304
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:57,610
The distance is also the age
of the Universe.

305
00:18:57,706 --> 00:18:59,681
The Universe was created
during the Big Bang, 

306
00:18:59,681 --> 00:19:01,520
it is expanding.

307
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,881
Galaxies further away from us 
are closer to the Big Bang epoch,

308
00:19:06,032 --> 00:19:09,313
they are younger than
the galaxies close to our own.

309
00:19:09,313 --> 00:19:15,361
If we establish a morphological
classification as a function of the distance,

310
00:19:15,361 --> 00:19:20,062
in the same time we establish a morphological
classification as a function of the age of the Universe.

311
00:19:20,062 --> 00:19:23,196
Observing at various distances,

312
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:27,080
we observe different epochs 
of the Universe.

313
00:19:27,105 --> 00:19:30,192
Here we have a morphological
classification giving

314
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:37,796
the percentage of each 
type of galaxy in the local universe:

315
00:19:37,796 --> 00:19:42,530
3% are elliptical galaxies,

316
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:46,434
15% are lenticular galaxies,

317
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:51,160
72% - spiral galaxies, 
the majority are spiral galaxies,

318
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:54,058
and 10% corresponding
to galaxies that we are not able to classify.

319
00:19:54,058 --> 00:19:58,785
This is one of the observational facts,
another one tells us that

320
00:19:58,785 --> 00:20:02,462
if the same observations are obtained
for galaxies further away

321
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:07,603
the results are not the same.
Previously there was 72% of the spiral galaxies

322
00:20:07,603 --> 00:20:10,239
now the spiral galaxies
represent only 31%.

323
00:20:10,239 --> 00:20:15,977
The galaxies that are not classified
represent 32% of the observed galaxies.

324
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,308
These are the galaxies that are

325
00:20:17,308 --> 00:20:22,765
at a different evolutionary stage 
than in here.

326
00:20:22,765 --> 00:20:25,573
Those morphological classifications
can be established

327
00:20:25,573 --> 00:20:29,725
as a function of distance 
regardless the theoretical tools

328
00:20:29,725 --> 00:20:31,957
at our disposal used to
understand the observations.

329
00:20:31,957 --> 00:20:35,122
It is essential that those theoretical
tools relate 

330
00:20:35,122 --> 00:20:40,561
at the same time the morphological
classification as a function of the distance,

331
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:45,461
masses determined using
the measures of the Doppler effect

332
00:20:45,461 --> 00:20:48,104
and the rotational velocities 
of galaxies.

333
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:51,840
They also have to relate to
the study of the stellar populations

334
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,721
that uses for example 

335
00:20:54,721 --> 00:20:56,956
the colour-magnitude diagrams
of the resolved stars 

336
00:20:56,956 --> 00:21:00,760
from various regions in galaxies 
also as a function of the distance.

337
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,507
Currently, the studies
of the formation

338
00:21:04,518 --> 00:21:07,593
and evolutions of galaxies
make great progress

339
00:21:07,593 --> 00:21:09,556
from the theoretical
as well as

340
00:21:09,556 --> 00:21:11,362
observational point of view.

341
00:21:11,362 --> 00:21:14,317
We have access to bigger
and bigger telescopes

342
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:17,085
that enable us to study galaxies

343
00:21:17,085 --> 00:21:20,520
which are further and further away, as the 
telescopes gather more and more light.

344
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:24,160
It is possible to study galaxies

345
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:26,754
with weaker and weaker 
intrinsic flux.

346
00:21:26,754 --> 00:21:29,992
And it is not all.
In addition to large telescopes

347
00:21:29,992 --> 00:21:33,961
there are smaller ones 
that specialise 

348
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:38,083
in detailed cartography
of large fraction of the Universe,

349
00:21:38,241 --> 00:21:40,351
maybe even the whole Universe.

350
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:44,212
It is possible to study
large samples of galaxies

351
00:21:44,212 --> 00:21:48,629
and with the obtained statistical properties,
from the observational point of view,

352
00:21:48,629 --> 00:21:51,486
and with progress in the data processing

353
00:21:51,486 --> 00:21:54,315
and on the theoretical side as well,

354
00:21:54,315 --> 00:21:58,181
one can create simulations
of entire "chunks" of  Universe containing

355
00:21:58,181 --> 00:22:01,926
billions of particles that are subject
to gravitational forces,

356
00:22:02,377 --> 00:22:05,280
pressure and even shock waves 

357
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:08,530
created by supernovae explosions
in galaxies.

358
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:14,311
It is now possible to confront theory and observations 

359
00:22:14,311 --> 00:22:18,378
and to draw some conclusions 
about the validity of theoretical models.
