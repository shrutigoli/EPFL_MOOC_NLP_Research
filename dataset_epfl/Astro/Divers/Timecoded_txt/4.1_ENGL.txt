1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:05,755
In extreme cases 
the tidal forces

2
00:00:05,755 --> 00:00:07,497
can distort the shape
of celestial bodies

3
00:00:07,497 --> 00:00:09,153
up to the point
of breaking them.

4
00:00:09,153 --> 00:00:11,635
Some planetary rings 
such as Saturn's,

5
00:00:11,635 --> 00:00:13,798
seen here by NASA's
Cassini probe,

6
00:00:13,798 --> 00:00:16,597
may be the result of the
destruction of a satellite

7
00:00:16,597 --> 00:00:18,438
under the effect of
tidal forces.

8
00:00:18,438 --> 00:00:21,329
We will see here that 
there is a limit in the

9
00:00:21,329 --> 00:00:23,768
distance between two bodies
before one of them breaks

10
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:26,346
under the effect of the
tidal forces from the other.

11
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:29,401
This distance is known as
the « Roche limit »

12
00:00:29,401 --> 00:00:31,642
from the French astronomer
Edouard Roche

13
00:00:31,642 --> 00:00:34,656
who first performed the 
calculation in the 19th century.

14
00:00:35,722 --> 00:00:37,671
Let us compute the Roche limit,

15
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:41,150
the distance at which a
satellite is destroyed

16
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,340
under the effect of the tidal
forces exerted by a planet.

17
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,229
Let us consider a planet

18
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:48,294
of a given radius R.

19
00:00:48,294 --> 00:00:51,422
Here is Jupiter as
an example.

20
00:00:51,422 --> 00:00:54,842
We assume it has a constant density ρ_M. 

21
00:00:54,842 --> 00:00:57,496
We also consider a satellite,

22
00:00:57,496 --> 00:01:00,131
"Io" for example, or
any other satellite

23
00:01:00,131 --> 00:01:04,398
which has a given density
ρ_m and a given radius r.

24
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:09,473
The two bodies are
at a distance d

25
00:01:09,473 --> 00:01:13,038
from each other. 

26
00:01:13,038 --> 00:01:15,476
We saw in the last chapter

27
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:20,644
that we have tidal forces exerted
on the points a and b here.

28
00:01:20,644 --> 00:01:23,174
These are differential forces

29
00:01:23,174 --> 00:01:25,468
due to the gradient 
of the gravitational field

30
00:01:25,468 --> 00:01:27,800
of Jupiter through the satellite,

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,486
namely Io in this example.

32
00:01:29,486 --> 00:01:32,809
The tidal forces are equal with 
opposed signs.

33
00:01:32,809 --> 00:01:35,678
We have a force here on B

34
00:01:35,678 --> 00:01:38,460
and another one here on A.

35
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,886
Both forces are stretching
the satellite. 

36
00:01:41,886 --> 00:01:44,481
We previously found that
the tidal force,

37
00:01:44,481 --> 00:01:48,911
when neglecting the rotation
of the satellite around Jupiter,

38
00:01:48,911 --> 00:01:52,507
exerted either on B
or on A,

39
00:01:52,507 --> 00:01:54,108
has the same value,

40
00:01:54,108 --> 00:01:59,562
is equal to 2GM / d³, with d the
distance between the two bodies,

41
00:01:59,562 --> 00:02:02,371
time the radius of the 
smallest object.

42
00:02:02,371 --> 00:02:05,518
This is the expression of the
tidal forces when neglecting

43
00:02:05,518 --> 00:02:09,661
the rotation of the satellite
around the planet.

44
00:02:09,846 --> 00:02:12,906
What happens when we do not
neglect the orbital

45
00:02:12,906 --> 00:02:15,093
motion of the satellite any more?

46
00:02:15,093 --> 00:02:22,356
The angular velocity is given by
2 π / P,

47
00:02:22,356 --> 00:02:25,510
where the orbital period P is
given by Kepler's laws.

48
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:28,509
We have a centripetal acceleration

49
00:02:28,509 --> 00:02:30,899
at the three points here

50
00:02:30,899 --> 00:02:33,631
at the centre and at the
edges of the satellite.

51
00:02:33,631 --> 00:02:41,248
This centripetal acceleration is
a =  ω ²r

52
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:45,052
where r is the distance
between the centre of Jupiter

53
00:02:45,052 --> 00:02:48,153
and each point we
are considering.

54
00:02:48,153 --> 00:02:51,034
We had the points A and B there

55
00:02:51,034 --> 00:02:56,260
as well as the centre C of the satellite.

56
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,769
Let us consider the
different forces.

57
00:03:00,769 --> 00:03:05,988
There is first the centripetal
acceleration. On the closest

58
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:09,390
point to Jupiter, A, it is smaller

59
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,570
than on the other points,

60
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:16,268
such as C here or B there.

61
00:03:20,223 --> 00:03:30,108
The acceleration on A is
ω² ( d - r) 

62
00:03:30,133 --> 00:03:37,394
At the centre we have an
acceleration ω² d

63
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:40,572
since the centre is at a distance
d from the centre of Jupiter

64
00:03:40,572 --> 00:03:45,388
and on B the centripetal
acceleration is

65
00:03:45,388 --> 00:03:49,724
ω² (d+r)

66
00:03:49,724 --> 00:03:53,521
We have thus a centripetal
acceleration to the centre of Jupiter

67
00:03:53,521 --> 00:03:55,313
We have thus a centripetal
acceleration to the centre of Jupiter

68
00:03:55,313 --> 00:03:59,299
At each point on the surface of the
satellite is felt a pseudo force

69
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:02,816
in particular at the points A, B

70
00:04:02,816 --> 00:04:05,756
and C the centre of the satellite.

71
00:04:05,756 --> 00:04:12,206
So we have like previously A, B and C.

72
00:04:12,906 --> 00:04:15,825
The pseudo force is in the
opposite direction

73
00:04:15,825 --> 00:04:20,267
with a norm equal to the
norm of the centripetal force.

74
00:04:20,267 --> 00:04:24,456
We have thus a small vector here on A,
a bigger vector here on C

75
00:04:24,456 --> 00:04:27,631
and an even bigger one on B

76
00:04:27,631 --> 00:04:29,500
such that the norm of
the different accelerations

77
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,883
are the ones we wrote previously.

78
00:04:31,883 --> 00:04:35,380
We now want to compute the
differential acceleration

79
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,826
at the points A and B

80
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:40,767
relative to the acceleration
at point C.

81
00:04:40,767 --> 00:04:44,649
To this purpose we subtract,
at A, B and C,

82
00:04:44,649 --> 00:04:48,853
the centripetal acceleration, or
the pseudo force felt at C.

83
00:04:48,853 --> 00:04:51,804
We add a vector with the same
norm as this one at C

84
00:04:51,804 --> 00:04:55,245
but with opposed direction.

85
00:04:55,245 --> 00:04:59,568
We have then a first arrow at C here
and another one at B there

86
00:04:59,568 --> 00:05:01,769
such that they have
the same norm.

87
00:05:01,769 --> 00:05:04,798
and a last one at A there 
with again the same norm.

88
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:08,658
We add the two vectors at each point

89
00:05:08,658 --> 00:05:11,354
and we get the resulting force.

90
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:15,134
Here at B we have a force
roughly like that,

91
00:05:15,134 --> 00:05:17,699
at the centre we have
obviously zero

92
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:23,301
and at A the resulting force
is in this direction.

93
00:05:23,301 --> 00:05:25,861
We are now interested
in computing

94
00:05:25,861 --> 00:05:29,383
the norm of these two
green arrows.

95
00:05:29,383 --> 00:05:33,827
Let us first write the norm of
the green arrow at point B.

96
00:05:33,827 --> 00:05:38,890
The acceleration at point B is

97
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:48,017
ω² (d+r)- ω² d

98
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:50,474
which is simply the difference

99
00:05:50,474 --> 00:05:56,642
between the white and the
red arrows, so finally = ω² r.

100
00:05:56,712 --> 00:06:01,940
The third Kepler law
tells us that

101
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:09,304
d³ / P²  =  G M

102
00:06:09,314 --> 00:06:12,482
where M is the mass of
the most massive body,

103
00:06:12,482 --> 00:06:21,773
over 4π², with ω = 2π / P,
P being the orbital period.

104
00:06:21,823 --> 00:06:30,182
From there we deduce that 
ω² = GM / d³

105
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:35,074
that we inject here in order
to get the acceleration at point B.

106
00:06:35,074 --> 00:06:42,244
It is equal to (G M / d³) * r

107
00:06:42,264 --> 00:06:47,155
As we've seen before, the tidal
acceleration at point b,

108
00:06:47,155 --> 00:06:50,582
caused by the gradient of
the gravitational force

109
00:06:50,582 --> 00:06:57,437
through the satellite, equals

110
00:06:57,527 --> 00:07:03,883
(2GM / d³) * r .

111
00:07:03,903 --> 00:07:07,040
We thus have an effect 
of differential rotation.

112
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:09,658
The differential acceleration
caused by the rotation

113
00:07:09,658 --> 00:07:11,512
of the satellite around the planet

114
00:07:11,512 --> 00:07:15,172
which is equal to half the tidal force

115
00:07:15,172 --> 00:07:17,881
and as such is by no
means insignificant.

116
00:07:17,881 --> 00:07:20,665
Now let us summarize
what we computed.

117
00:07:20,665 --> 00:07:25,180
We still have our two points A and B.
We will look in greater details

118
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:27,976
what happens at point B.

119
00:07:27,976 --> 00:07:31,405
We have our satellite with a radius r

120
00:07:31,405 --> 00:07:37,049
and we have several forces.
We have first the tidal force

121
00:07:37,049 --> 00:07:40,860
that we computed
in the previous video,

122
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:44,254
the differential acceleration

123
00:07:44,254 --> 00:07:46,918
which is half of this force there

124
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:50,128
and in the other direction we have

125
00:07:50,198 --> 00:07:55,066
the g of the satellite.

126
00:07:55,066 --> 00:08:01,299
So here is the
tidal acceleration

127
00:08:01,369 --> 00:08:09,274
which is equal to  
(2GM / d³) * r.

128
00:08:09,354 --> 00:08:15,174
We have the centripetal
acceleration we just computed,

129
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:23,504
which is equal to  (GM / d³) * r.

130
00:08:23,514 --> 00:08:26,738
The satellite is torn apart

131
00:08:26,738 --> 00:08:31,709
if the norm of the sum of

132
00:08:31,709 --> 00:08:39,138
a_M  +  the tidal acceleration,

133
00:08:39,258 --> 00:08:41,704
so the sum of the two forces,

134
00:08:41,704 --> 00:08:45,968
is greater than the norm
of the gravitational field

135
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:48,198
which holds the satellite together.

136
00:08:48,198 --> 00:08:51,086
If the sum of these two
accelerations is greater than g

137
00:08:51,086 --> 00:08:53,764
then the satellite is destroyed.

138
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:57,386
Let us write it as equations :

139
00:08:57,386 --> 00:09:06,846
(3 GM / d³)  *  r  >  Gm

140
00:09:06,896 --> 00:09:09,583
where m is the mass
of the satellite,

141
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:12,155
over  r², its radius.

142
00:09:12,155 --> 00:09:15,313
This term is the gravitational
field at the surface of the satellite.

143
00:09:15,313 --> 00:09:17,743
To simplify we will assume

144
00:09:17,743 --> 00:09:26,316
that m = 4/3  π r³ * ρ_m,
ro_m being the satellite density.

145
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:31,453
With the same assumption, the
mass of the planet, Jupiter here,

146
00:09:31,453 --> 00:09:38,607
is : M = 4/3 π R³ * ρ_M.

147
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:42,892
We consider ρ to be constant.

148
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:46,423
If we plug m and M in
this equation here

149
00:09:46,423 --> 00:09:49,866
we will find the critical distance
we are interested in :

150
00:09:49,866 --> 00:09:57,180
d_Roche = 1.4 times the ratio of the
densities of the two bodies,

151
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:02,383
to the power 1/3, times the
radius of the larger body,

152
00:10:02,383 --> 00:10:04,178
Jupiter in this case.

153
00:10:04,178 --> 00:10:06,482
This is an approximation

154
00:10:06,482 --> 00:10:09,828
that does not take into account 
the internal cohesive forces

155
00:10:09,828 --> 00:10:13,204
If we make an exact calculation,
we would find here

156
00:10:13,204 --> 00:10:16,111
a factor 2.5.

157
00:10:16,111 --> 00:10:21,690
This distance, d_Roche, is the one
we have to inject in this equation here

158
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,362
to have an equality.

159
00:10:23,362 --> 00:10:26,246
If the distance is smaller, the
satellite is torn apart

160
00:10:26,246 --> 00:10:28,425
by the combined effect of tidal forces

161
00:10:28,425 --> 00:10:32,950
and centripetal acceleration
caused by the planet.

162
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,860
Let us come back to the planet Saturn.

163
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,552
The rings you see here

164
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:38,614
are the result of the
break-up of a body

165
00:10:38,614 --> 00:10:40,923
that crossed the Roche
limit and broke

166
00:10:40,923 --> 00:10:43,402
under the effect of the
tidal forces from Saturn.

167
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:45,778
But all the rings don't have
the same origin.

168
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:50,695
The external ring, the E ring of Saturn,
slightly blurred on this picture

169
00:10:50,695 --> 00:10:52,702
taken by the Cassini space probe

170
00:10:52,702 --> 00:10:55,671
is actually created by the 
extreme volcanic activity

171
00:10:55,671 --> 00:10:57,856
of a satellite of Saturn, Enceladus.

172
00:10:57,856 --> 00:11:00,798
The plumes that you see
going out of the satellite

173
00:11:00,798 --> 00:11:03,019
are composed of water vapour

174
00:11:03,019 --> 00:11:04,805
heated partly by the friction

175
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:07,277
of matter in the internal
mantle of the satellite

176
00:11:07,277 --> 00:11:09,798
under the effect of tidal
forces from Saturn.

177
00:11:09,798 --> 00:11:13,504
Part of the water vapour
is ejected to the orbit

178
00:11:13,504 --> 00:11:16,112
of the satellite with some dust.

179
00:11:16,112 --> 00:11:18,304
The process creates a wide ring

180
00:11:18,304 --> 00:11:21,681
materializing the orbit of
Enceladus around Saturn.

181
00:11:21,681 --> 00:11:24,594
In the solar system, the bodies most
affected by the

182
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:27,425
Roche limit are
probably the comets.

183
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:30,797
They travel at high speed through
the whole solar system

184
00:11:30,797 --> 00:11:33,494
and therefore get often quite close
to strong gravitational fields

185
00:11:33,494 --> 00:11:36,272
such as Jupiter's or the Sun's.

186
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:39,313
In both cases the comets
can be destroyed

187
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:41,518
if they cross the Roche limit.

188
00:11:41,518 --> 00:11:44,731
This is what happened to the
comet Shoemaker-Levy 9

189
00:11:44,731 --> 00:11:48,438
getting too close to Jupiter
in may 1994.

190
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:50,886
The comet broke up in 21 pieces

191
00:11:50,886 --> 00:11:52,768
clearly visible on this picture
taken by the Hubble space telescope

192
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:54,706
clearly visible on this picture
taken by the Hubble space telescope

193
00:11:54,706 --> 00:11:57,587
where we see debris 
spreading over a distance

194
00:11:57,587 --> 00:11:59,597
of more or less 1 million kilometres. 

195
00:11:59,597 --> 00:12:02,898
Three months later these
debris came back to Jupiter

196
00:12:02,898 --> 00:12:05,948
and eventually crashed on the
surface, on 16th July 1994. 

197
00:12:05,948 --> 00:12:09,263
Several impacts were visible
on the planet's surface

198
00:12:09,263 --> 00:12:11,420
for several days.

199
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:14,240
Some impact marks even reached
the size of the Earth.
