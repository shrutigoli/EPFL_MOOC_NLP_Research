1
00:00:04,122 --> 00:00:06,032
We have seen in 
the previous lesson 

2
00:00:06,032 --> 00:00:08,794
the principal radiation processes 
in astrophysics.

3
00:00:08,937 --> 00:00:11,834
Radiation can be collected 
by telescopes,

4
00:00:11,834 --> 00:00:15,314
or by antennas depending 
on the wavelength range.

5
00:00:15,552 --> 00:00:18,486
Observatories can be 
placed on the ground,

6
00:00:18,486 --> 00:00:21,053
if the atmosphere doesn't 
interact too much

7
00:00:21,053 --> 00:00:23,362
with the radiation from
stellar objects, 

8
00:00:23,362 --> 00:00:26,312
or in space.

9
00:00:26,629 --> 00:00:29,274
For every case, we need
to be able to quantify, 

10
00:00:29,274 --> 00:00:31,201
we have to measure 
the radiation.

11
00:00:31,201 --> 00:00:33,425
We will see in the
following how astronomers

12
00:00:33,425 --> 00:00:35,955
measure the luminous flux,
the colour of the stellar objects,

13
00:00:35,962 --> 00:00:37,533
and how to estimate

14
00:00:37,533 --> 00:00:40,203
the luminous power 
of stellar objects.

15
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:42,659
How can one analyse light?

16
00:00:42,659 --> 00:00:45,148
Either on analyses light 
through the spectrum.

17
00:00:45,148 --> 00:00:48,010
So the luminous intensity in
function of the wavelength.

18
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:50,627
Or one integrates light 
through filters,

19
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:52,264
where we filter

20
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:54,392
only certain wavelengths

21
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:58,638
thanks to filters which have 
here a transmission curve

22
00:00:58,638 --> 00:01:01,627
The high end of the curve is
where we let pass the

23
00:01:01,627 --> 00:01:03,927
most light at a certain wavelength.

24
00:01:03,932 --> 00:01:06,970
and the low sections of the curve, 
is where less light goes through.

25
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,477
So these filters are 
actually

26
00:01:08,477 --> 00:01:11,009
optical filters, which we 
put behind a telescope.

27
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,113
So here we have a blue filter, for example,

28
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:15,091
which lets only 
pass blue light

29
00:01:15,091 --> 00:01:17,351
and blocks out any other wavelength. 

30
00:01:17,895 --> 00:01:20,195
So we can have lots 
of series of filters.

31
00:01:20,695 --> 00:01:23,375
Here is a red filter.

32
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:25,811
and here another one, 
even redder.

33
00:01:26,278 --> 00:01:28,868
and here another one
redder still.

34
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:33,263
So light will be filtered.

35
00:01:35,663 --> 00:01:37,056
Here we have 

36
00:01:37,056 --> 00:01:39,561
4 optical filters which we 
can give names to.

37
00:01:39,561 --> 00:01:42,751
For example this one is 
the B filter for blue.

38
00:01:43,094 --> 00:01:45,014
V for green or visual.

39
00:01:45,798 --> 00:01:47,555
R for the red filter.

40
00:01:47,555 --> 00:01:49,400
and here I for infra-red. 

41
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,825
The eye starts not being able to see

42
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:54,406
at the wavelengths beyond 
these or below these.

43
00:01:54,406 --> 00:01:56,155
Cameras can however,

44
00:01:56,155 --> 00:01:58,202
see very well at 
these wavelengths.

45
00:01:58,202 --> 00:01:59,447
 So the goal of a filter,

46
00:01:59,447 --> 00:02:02,957
is to select ranges 
of wavelengths.

47
00:02:05,045 --> 00:02:07,645
Once the wavelength 
ranges are selected

48
00:02:07,652 --> 00:02:10,982
one can integrate the
light in the filters

49
00:02:11,329 --> 00:02:13,791
and see the spatial 
distribution of the light.

50
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:15,845
And that is, of 
course, an image

51
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:21,303
So here we have the B filter, we 
will integrate the light here in a certain filter.

52
00:02:21,303 --> 00:02:24,601
So we multiply the spectrum 
by the transmission curve

53
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:27,503
and integrate it over all wavelengths

54
00:02:27,503 --> 00:02:31,194
This will give us the flux
in a certain bandwidth.

55
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:35,539
and the flux in the bandwidth, 
in function of the spatial position,

56
00:02:35,539 --> 00:02:37,896
is an image.

57
00:02:37,896 --> 00:02:42,257
An image is the luminous intensity
at a certain wavelength,

58
00:02:42,257 --> 00:02:43,877
and at a certain pixel.

59
00:02:43,883 --> 00:02:46,750
So we can take images 
at all wavelengths.

60
00:02:46,750 --> 00:02:50,800
Here we have the image
corresponding to the blue filter,

61
00:02:50,814 --> 00:02:55,444
for the 5555 angströms filter 

62
00:02:55,786 --> 00:02:57,564
of the Hubble Space telescope.

63
00:02:57,564 --> 00:02:59,954
We can do of course 
the same thing

64
00:03:00,457 --> 00:03:01,909
at different wavelengths.

65
00:03:01,909 --> 00:03:05,399
So we integrate the flux in one 
wavelength range and note 

66
00:03:05,399 --> 00:03:09,024
the value of the minor flux
in function of the position.

67
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:11,875
So we get here, for example, 
an infra-red image

68
00:03:11,875 --> 00:03:14,911
at a wavelength of 8140 angströms.

69
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:17,661
So here we have a galaxy as seen
by the Hubble Space telescope

70
00:03:17,869 --> 00:03:20,758
at a red wavelength, here 
almost infra-red.

71
00:03:20,758 --> 00:03:24,348
and at a blue wavelength, 
here almost ultraviolet.

72
00:03:25,399 --> 00:03:27,409
What can we see in these images?

73
00:03:27,422 --> 00:03:31,440
On the left here, we see an image 
taken with the Hubble Space telescope

74
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:34,320
of a galaxy, and here the same 
galaxy, with the same field of view

75
00:03:34,322 --> 00:03:37,882
taken with a infra-red filter.

76
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,871
What we see is obviously different since
objects have different spectra's,

77
00:03:42,871 --> 00:03:45,543
some objects will appear 
more clearly on the blue filter,

78
00:03:45,543 --> 00:03:47,983
and others will appear more 
clearly on the red filter.

79
00:03:47,983 --> 00:03:51,793
So we see some objects of this type.

80
00:03:52,235 --> 00:03:54,875
If we look here,
for example,

81
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,313
we see a star that has a weak
luminous flux in the optical wavelengths

82
00:03:59,313 --> 00:04:01,743
but a strong one in the infra-red.

83
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:06,254
We know already, here, that 
that star is a red star.

84
00:04:07,051 --> 00:04:10,352
Now there are star formation 
zones in galaxies.

85
00:04:10,352 --> 00:04:14,312
Stars, we have seen in the 
lesson about black body radiation,

86
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:18,589
when they are young, hot and massif 
radiate more in the blue.

87
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:22,167
That is why we see here 
star formation zones

88
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:25,037
which appear strongly 
in blue filters..

89
00:04:25,037 --> 00:04:27,750
But the contrast with other regions

90
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,370
is less distinct in the red filter.

91
00:04:30,385 --> 00:04:34,591
So we have here a zone where stars
are young, hot,

92
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:36,307
massif and blue.

93
00:04:36,307 --> 00:04:38,987
And so radiate more 
in the blue then in the red.

94
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:44,197
We can have certain dust
zones, for example.

95
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:47,537
We have here one, in 
the spiral arms of the galaxy.

96
00:04:48,104 --> 00:04:51,364
Dust absorbs strongly
blue light,

97
00:04:51,369 --> 00:04:53,554
but much less red light

98
00:04:53,554 --> 00:04:55,518
So we have a contrast here

99
00:04:55,518 --> 00:04:58,483
which is very strong between
dust zones and the rest

100
00:04:58,483 --> 00:05:01,400
of the galaxy in blue
while the contrast

101
00:05:02,023 --> 00:05:04,466
is much weaker here
in the blue.

102
00:05:04,466 --> 00:05:08,163
That is simply because rad light 
passes trhough dust more easyly

103
00:05:08,163 --> 00:05:09,833
then blue light.

104
00:05:10,266 --> 00:05:14,737
A way of visualising this, is to
make an image

105
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:15,792
in true colors.

106
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:19,274
It is more a "false colour" images but
where the colours are coded

107
00:05:19,274 --> 00:05:22,896
so that the eye finds
the color map

108
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:24,586
which it is used to.

109
00:05:25,123 --> 00:05:29,711
To take an image in true colours,
we take a spectrum, or in other words

110
00:05:29,711 --> 00:05:33,423
we take an image, we 
have for example a spectrum,

111
00:05:33,423 --> 00:05:35,931
we will symbolise the spectrum like this

112
00:05:35,931 --> 00:05:38,291
and then we take the 
filter, for example

113
00:05:39,998 --> 00:05:41,726
the blue one from the space telescope.

114
00:05:41,726 --> 00:05:45,025
we will integrate the light over a 
certain range of wavelengths.

115
00:05:45,025 --> 00:05:49,582
We will take the red filter
we had before.

116
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,367
We will integrate the light here,
where we have the blue filter,

117
00:05:53,367 --> 00:05:56,685
the red filter and in this case
we even added the

118
00:05:56,685 --> 00:05:58,792
optical H-alpha filter, which 
you will remember,

119
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:02,972
is one the most important
lines of the hydrogen atom.

120
00:06:03,604 --> 00:06:04,787
This line

121
00:06:04,787 --> 00:06:09,226
is at 6563 angströms,

122
00:06:09,226 --> 00:06:12,481
If we visualised it on this spectrum,

123
00:06:12,481 --> 00:06:14,847
it would be something 
rather narrow like this.

124
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:17,333
This line is typical of
star formation.

125
00:06:17,333 --> 00:06:20,445
and therefore it is interesting,
which is what has been done here,

126
00:06:20,445 --> 00:06:22,526
to add a narrow filter,

127
00:06:22,526 --> 00:06:27,266
which is the H-alpha filter which will catch 
just that narrow hydrogen line.

128
00:06:27,856 --> 00:06:31,576
So now we will make an
RGB image,

129
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,803
so red, green (Visual) and blue.

130
00:06:35,288 --> 00:06:39,051
The blue part of the image,

131
00:06:39,051 --> 00:06:42,601
the blue pixels will be coded 
with the image that was taken

132
00:06:42,601 --> 00:06:45,531
with the blue filter, the B-filter.

133
00:06:46,427 --> 00:06:50,997
For the green part of the image,

134
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:57,578
the red optical image will be used
and then we will take 

135
00:06:57,898 --> 00:07:00,978
the H-alpha line 
for the red part.

136
00:07:02,106 --> 00:07:04,286
Each time a pixel 
has a high flux,

137
00:07:04,286 --> 00:07:06,485
in this image it 
will appear red.

138
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:09,340
When it has a high flux in this 
image it will appear blue.

139
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,175
and if it has a high flux in this 
image it will appear green.

140
00:07:12,175 --> 00:07:14,469
Now we can combine all this
into one image,

141
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:17,528
we take a weighting of the same
pixel in the three images

142
00:07:17,528 --> 00:07:20,440
and then make a colour image.

143
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:24,512
In this colour image, 
we can see, for example,

144
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:27,993
the star we saw before, 
which was very red, or at least

145
00:07:27,993 --> 00:07:31,578
the point that was in the image
and that was very red.

146
00:07:31,578 --> 00:07:36,031
We see the blue star formation
zones, there are lots

147
00:07:36,031 --> 00:07:42,161
of small blue points that are
massive stars in formation,

148
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:43,838
Almost formed but which 
emit very blue radiation

149
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,362
so very hot black bodies.

150
00:07:45,362 --> 00:07:49,531
And then we find a certain number
of red zones, here for example.

151
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:51,690
So that,

152
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,841
is the H-alpha radiation.

153
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:57,060
The pixel with high flux
in this image here, H-alpha,

154
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:59,100
appear in red in the image.

155
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:01,860
When you see this image 
in false colours, 

156
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,002
they are not just there 
to be pretty.

157
00:08:04,002 --> 00:08:06,700
We can easily see, here, 
the physical processes

158
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,203
that can cause different
types of radiation.

159
00:08:09,203 --> 00:08:12,570
So in blue young, hot 
and massif stars.

160
00:08:12,570 --> 00:08:16,840
In red, gas zones ionised
by massive stars.

161
00:08:16,841 --> 00:08:21,526
Each time we have massive stars, we 
see them directly in blue.

162
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:25,536
But we see them also by the 
ionisation they cause 

163
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,949
in the hydrogen clouds.

164
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:29,859
There we see the hydrogen
H-alpha line

165
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:32,766
which is produced by 
excitation of the hydrogen atoms

166
00:08:32,766 --> 00:08:36,876
which de-energise themselves by
emitting the famous H-alpha line.

167
00:08:38,275 --> 00:08:41,571
So astronomers like 
using logarithmic scales

168
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:44,051
to quantify the luminous fluxes
and the luminosities.

169
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:47,248
We have already seen the 
luminosity, for example of a star,

170
00:08:47,248 --> 00:08:51,008
at a certain wavelength, 
lets say L lambda.

171
00:08:52,304 --> 00:08:55,634
And this star is situated at
a certain distance from us.

172
00:08:56,732 --> 00:09:00,542
We will capture the radiation
at a certain distance d.

173
00:09:00,805 --> 00:09:04,299
and this radiation will be diluted,
if it is isotropic,

174
00:09:04,299 --> 00:09:07,219
over a sphere with a surface
of 4 pi d².

175
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:11,803
So here we will have the
flux F lambda,

176
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:16,859
and this F lambda flux will be equal
to, as we have seen before, L lambda,

177
00:09:17,006 --> 00:09:21,606
so the luminosity divided by 4 pi 
times the square of the distance.

178
00:09:22,624 --> 00:09:23,654
Now,

179
00:09:25,978 --> 00:09:28,437
to take into account what 
the ancients saw 

180
00:09:28,437 --> 00:09:30,634
and with the logarithmic scale of the eye,

181
00:09:30,634 --> 00:09:34,838
the astronomers have decided 
to measure the luminous flux,

182
00:09:34,838 --> 00:09:38,278
not in flux, but in magnitude over a 
logarithmic scale.

183
00:09:38,329 --> 00:09:40,839
This logarithmic scale 
is defined as:

184
00:09:40,843 --> 00:09:45,003
-2.5 log (flux)

185
00:09:45,334 --> 00:09:48,374
at a certain wavelength, 
lambda in this case here.

186
00:09:48,998 --> 00:09:52,528
Now we can also integrate 
the flux though a filter,

187
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:57,152
so we can define for example,
if X is a filter,

188
00:09:59,904 --> 00:10:01,604
for a certain
bandwidth,

189
00:10:01,604 --> 00:10:07,537
for example B,V,R ou I
as we defined earlier.

190
00:10:07,537 --> 00:10:10,567
So X can be one of those letters

191
00:10:11,283 --> 00:10:15,793
The magnitude of the X filter will be

192
00:10:15,793 --> 00:10:19,603
- 2.5 log base 10

193
00:10:20,081 --> 00:10:23,591
of the integral F lambda d lambda.

194
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:26,076
In other words we will have

195
00:10:26,076 --> 00:10:30,756
mx equals - 2.5 log

196
00:10:31,075 --> 00:10:33,955
of the total flux in X band.

197
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,092
This flux in a flux expressed 
in erg by seconds, 

198
00:10:38,092 --> 00:10:41,945
so a power by cm². So we have 
no angströms anymore

199
00:10:41,945 --> 00:10:44,705
because we integrated 
over all wavelengths.

200
00:10:44,705 --> 00:10:48,375
We have a power by cm²,
which is a power flux.

201
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:52,785
So now, how do we calibrate
our flux scale ?

202
00:10:53,527 --> 00:10:56,527
In fact the calibration, 
will be the Vega star,

203
00:10:57,473 --> 00:10:59,887
an extremely bright star 
in the northern hemisphere.

204
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:04,007
So we define the magnitude
as being equal to zero in the V filter

205
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:07,100
Lets see how this works,
we take an object

206
00:11:07,254 --> 00:11:09,515
of which we want to measure the magnitude

207
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:12,565
and the Vega stars, so alpha
in the Lyre constellation.

208
00:11:12,657 --> 00:11:16,767
And we will integrate the flux 
of the object in the V band.

209
00:11:17,503 --> 00:11:20,603
Here we have the transmission of the V band.

210
00:11:20,885 --> 00:11:23,675
We will do the same 
with the Vega star.

211
00:11:24,548 --> 00:11:28,438
Here we have a certain flux

212
00:11:29,008 --> 00:11:31,618
in the V band of our object.

213
00:11:31,786 --> 00:11:36,296
and here we have the flux in
the V band of the Vega star.

214
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:39,541
Of course we can do that 
with any other band.

215
00:11:40,145 --> 00:11:43,295
So the flux in the V band,
will be by definition

216
00:11:43,296 --> 00:11:48,646
the integral of F lambda times
the transmission of the V d lambda filter.

217
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:53,121
And then, to simplify, we normalise

218
00:11:53,391 --> 00:11:57,962
and say that the transmission 
integral of the filter

219
00:11:57,962 --> 00:11:59,061
is equal to 1.

220
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:02,531
In other words, we erase that term
from the equation above.

221
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:06,152
Now the flux will rescaled
in function of Vega,

222
00:12:06,152 --> 00:12:11,388
which means that the magnitude
of the V filter, of our object,

223
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:17,487
will be - 2.5 log of the flux

224
00:12:17,955 --> 00:12:20,295
in the V band of the object,

225
00:12:21,027 --> 00:12:25,449
rescaled to the flux in the V band
of the Vega star.

226
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:27,134
So this flux divided by this flux,

227
00:12:27,134 --> 00:12:30,232
we take the log minus 2.5 and 
we have the magnitude of our object. 

228
00:12:30,232 --> 00:12:32,188
There is something 
here we don't see

229
00:12:32,188 --> 00:12:34,765
because in fact, we said that this,

230
00:12:34,765 --> 00:12:37,700
is also equal to the magnitude
in the V band of the object.

231
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:40,061
minus the magnitude
in the V band of Vega

232
00:12:40,061 --> 00:12:41,921
and this is equal to :

233
00:12:43,563 --> 00:12:45,710
Now by definition,

234
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:49,344
the Vega magnitude in 
the V band is equal to zero.

235
00:12:49,344 --> 00:12:52,900
So the magnitude of the object 
is the same as this one.

236
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,306
Therefore the magnitude of an object,

237
00:12:54,306 --> 00:12:57,002
equals -2.5 log of the flux.

238
00:12:57,002 --> 00:12:59,522
and it is always 
rescaled to Vega.

239
00:12:59,522 --> 00:13:01,568
So we know by how much 
something is more luminous 

240
00:13:01,568 --> 00:13:03,428
or less luminous then Vega,

241
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:06,417
on a logarithmic scale, 
in a certain band,

242
00:13:06,417 --> 00:13:07,567
here the V band.

243
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:09,908
And there is this -2.5 factor that 

244
00:13:09,908 --> 00:13:14,533
transforms the objective or 
"quantitative" scale

245
00:13:14,533 --> 00:13:16,697
to a more subjective scale
that is the 

246
00:13:16,697 --> 00:13:20,529
logarithmic scale of the human eye 
which is of course the scale used

247
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:23,799
by the ancients to characterise
the brightness of the stars.

248
00:13:24,624 --> 00:13:28,004
So we have measured the flux of objects 
in different boundaries in function

249
00:13:28,004 --> 00:13:30,014
of the flux of Vega in different boundaries.

250
00:13:30,014 --> 00:13:32,674
Now we will measure
the flux ratio

251
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:34,927
of the same object 
but this time,

252
00:13:34,927 --> 00:13:37,437
with different boundarie.
For example, here, 

253
00:13:37,437 --> 00:13:41,523
we will have the measured flux ratio
for an object in the V band.

254
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:44,403
So Fv of the object and
we will compare this 

255
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:48,442
to the flux of the same 
object in the I band.

256
00:13:48,442 --> 00:13:50,282
In other words, what 
we measure here,

257
00:13:50,473 --> 00:13:53,733
is the slope of the spectrum 
between the two bands.

258
00:13:53,974 --> 00:13:58,002
And this slope has to be calibrated,
so we will measure it in function

259
00:13:58,616 --> 00:14:02,716
of the same flux ratio between 
two bands for the Vega star.

260
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:05,432
I will measure the 
slope of my spectrum

261
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:08,652
in function of the slope
of the spectrum of the Vega star.

262
00:14:08,652 --> 00:14:10,519
So here I will
define notations. 

263
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:14,255
We have Fv of Vega,

264
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:19,516
and here Fi of Vega.

265
00:14:19,836 --> 00:14:22,256
and now, if we express
all that in magnitudes, 

266
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,676
the magnitude of my object 
in the V band

267
00:14:25,676 --> 00:14:28,566
minus the magnitude of 
my object in the I band,

268
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:30,648
we find the 
following equation,

269
00:14:30,648 --> 00:14:34,528
from what we have seen in
the earlier slides:

270
00:14:35,117 --> 00:14:37,935
This is simply the 
magnitude difference,

271
00:14:37,935 --> 00:14:40,243
of my object in
function of Vega,

272
00:14:40,243 --> 00:14:42,180
between the V band
and the I band.

273
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:45,200
Now we can rearrange
a bit the equation.

274
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,304
I can write mv minus mi.

275
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:51,367
Here after rearranging 
the equation,

276
00:14:51,369 --> 00:14:54,751
what we measure here is
the flux ratio of our object

277
00:14:54,751 --> 00:14:56,919
in the V band in function of the I band.

278
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,812
We compare this to the Vega flux ratio

279
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:02,469
in the V band in function of the I band.

280
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,849
In other words,

281
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,785
we look at the relative
slope of my object 

282
00:15:06,785 --> 00:15:09,429
in function of the relative
slope of the Vega spectrum.

283
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:11,441
So we look at the colour of the object,

284
00:15:11,441 --> 00:15:13,394
compared to that of Vega.

285
00:15:13,394 --> 00:15:15,354
So in practice 
we will use

286
00:15:15,354 --> 00:15:17,035
different colour indexes.

287
00:15:17,035 --> 00:15:23,025
So instead of writing
m indexed V and I,

288
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:26,608
often we will write 
in big letter like this.

289
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:29,878
For example V minus I,
B minus V,

290
00:15:30,445 --> 00:15:32,425
and we will define colour indexes,

291
00:15:32,425 --> 00:15:35,296
and in these colour indexes,
we will always put

292
00:15:35,296 --> 00:15:38,516
the bluest filter left.

293
00:15:39,074 --> 00:15:43,044
With these conventions,
a big colour index

294
00:15:43,401 --> 00:15:47,596
will be typically a red object,

295
00:15:47,596 --> 00:15:50,768
and a weak colour index 
will be a blue object.

296
00:15:50,768 --> 00:15:56,888
For example B - V big 
is typically a red object.

297
00:15:57,349 --> 00:15:58,821
so redder then Vega.

298
00:15:58,821 --> 00:16:03,271
and B - V small will 
be a blue one,

299
00:16:03,742 --> 00:16:04,982
so bluer then Vega,

300
00:16:04,982 --> 00:16:07,402
since everything is scaled to the Vega star.

301
00:16:07,976 --> 00:16:12,113
So we have defined the fluxes,
the luminosities, the magnitudes,

302
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:15,853
and the colour of the stars
and stellar objects in general.

303
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:17,860
We will now define
another 

304
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:19,750
extremely important quantity
in astrophysics:

305
00:16:19,753 --> 00:16:20,914
the absolute magnitudes.

306
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:24,754
In fact the magnitude of an object 
seen at a distance of 10 parsecs.

307
00:16:25,716 --> 00:16:30,672
So we will say that absolute 
magnitudes are in fact visual

308
00:16:30,672 --> 00:16:33,095
magnitudes : the small m
we saw earlier,

309
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:35,415
seen from a distance of 10 parsecs.

310
00:16:35,415 --> 00:16:37,690
That is the magnitude

311
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:39,940
of an object, if it is seen 
from 10 parsecs

312
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,870
So of course the 
visual magnitude,

313
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:47,400
which is - 2.5 log of the flux,

314
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:51,777
where the flux is again
what we defined before L.

315
00:16:51,777 --> 00:16:55,667
That is the luminosity of an object,

316
00:16:56,425 --> 00:17:01,475
diluted over a certain surface here
where we have a certain flux.

317
00:17:02,164 --> 00:17:05,774
And the flux is equal to 4 pi d².

318
00:17:06,022 --> 00:17:09,514
So the absolute magnitude,
will - 2.5 log of flux,

319
00:17:09,514 --> 00:17:12,119
when d is equal to 10 parsecs.

320
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,652
We can calculate the difference 
between the 2 magnitudes :

321
00:17:15,652 --> 00:17:18,441
the visual magnitude
rescaled to Vega

322
00:17:18,441 --> 00:17:21,267
and the magnitude at ten parsecs.

323
00:17:21,267 --> 00:17:24,091
So again we use the 
definition of magnitudes

324
00:17:24,091 --> 00:17:26,871
-2.5 log.

325
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:33,245
So the flux, is L divided by 4 pi d²

326
00:17:34,188 --> 00:17:36,709
and the absolute magnitude
as we said,

327
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:41,453
is the flux of the object if it
is seen from 10 parsecs away.

328
00:17:41,453 --> 00:17:46,573
So we use here already the right
units: four pi times ten squared.

329
00:17:47,271 --> 00:17:50,661
Now, we see that this is equal to -2.5

330
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:53,536
lof of ten squared over d squared.

331
00:17:53,536 --> 00:17:55,797
In other words, m minus M,

332
00:17:55,797 --> 00:17:59,837
is equal to 5 log d - 5.

333
00:17:59,962 --> 00:18:04,392
And that is an absolutely fundamental
equation in astrophysics.

334
00:18:04,453 --> 00:18:06,853
A key result

335
00:18:06,853 --> 00:18:09,743
since it is this equation which allows
us to measure distance,

336
00:18:09,743 --> 00:18:11,945
thanks to, for example,
standard candles,

337
00:18:11,945 --> 00:18:14,250
supernovas or Cepheid stars 

338
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:15,506
which we will see later.

339
00:18:15,506 --> 00:18:21,536
This is called the distance module
with d in parsecs.

340
00:18:22,796 --> 00:18:24,056
By definition,

341
00:18:24,056 --> 00:18:27,616
the difference between apparent 
magnitude and absolute magnitude,

342
00:18:27,616 --> 00:18:31,301
is + 5 log(d) in parsecs -5

343
00:18:31,796 --> 00:18:33,751
So we can immediately see
that if we can get 

344
00:18:33,751 --> 00:18:35,492
an object for which we measure

345
00:18:35,492 --> 00:18:38,676
the apparent magnitude
and for which we know,

346
00:18:38,676 --> 00:18:40,786
in an independent manner
the absolute magnitude,

347
00:18:41,029 --> 00:18:43,072
we will be able to 
know its distance.

348
00:18:43,072 --> 00:18:45,268
The measurement of the distance
is one of the tasks

349
00:18:45,268 --> 00:18:47,189
are extremely important
in astrophysics.

350
00:18:47,189 --> 00:18:48,867
Measuring the distances
and the mass,

351
00:18:48,867 --> 00:18:51,800
are two key components

352
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:54,184
for the understanding 
of the formation and evolution

353
00:18:54,184 --> 00:18:55,934
of stellar objects.

354
00:18:56,512 --> 00:18:59,005
Now some orders of magnitudes,

355
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,585
magnitudes of well 
known objects.

356
00:19:00,586 --> 00:19:06,896
So here we have the apparent 
magnitude for a series of objects.

357
00:19:07,106 --> 00:19:11,505
And here we have the absolute
magnitude of different objects.

358
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:13,295
So this is the absolute magnitude.

359
00:19:13,295 --> 00:19:15,554
This is of course the apparent magnitude 

360
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:18,915
that an object would have if it was placed
placed at a distance of 10 parsecs.

361
00:19:18,915 --> 00:19:22,189
So the Sun has 
the smallest magnitude

362
00:19:22,189 --> 00:19:24,068
of all objects in the sky,

363
00:19:24,068 --> 00:19:27,335
so it the brightest object,
in appearance at least.

364
00:19:27,335 --> 00:19:31,575
Because if we put it at 10 parsecs
its magnitude is plus 4.8.

365
00:19:31,577 --> 00:19:34,081
Plus 4,8, is around 

366
00:19:34,081 --> 00:19:37,486
the magnitude that the almost
invisible to the naked eye objects have.

367
00:19:37,486 --> 00:19:41,215
So the Sun, at a distance of 10 parsecs, would be 
a weak star indistinguishable from the rest, 

368
00:19:41,215 --> 00:19:43,419
in fact almost invisible to the naked eye.

369
00:19:43,419 --> 00:19:47,976
So, now, at the complete 
opposite of the scale,

370
00:19:47,976 --> 00:19:50,092
we take an extremely weak object,

371
00:19:50,092 --> 00:19:52,813
with a high, positive magnitude,

372
00:19:52,813 --> 00:19:55,622
so for example some
very distant quasars.

373
00:19:55,622 --> 00:19:57,186
These ibjects are almost invisible

374
00:19:57,186 --> 00:19:59,936
with the biggest actual
telescopes.

375
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:02,509
And if we put these object 
at a distance of 10 parsecs,

376
00:20:02,509 --> 00:20:04,139
they have a magnitude of minus 30.

377
00:20:04,139 --> 00:20:05,118
So they would be,

378
00:20:05,118 --> 00:20:08,027
if they were at ten parsecs 
from us, a lot brighter,

379
00:20:08,027 --> 00:20:10,498
three magnitudes brighter
then the Sun.

380
00:20:10,499 --> 00:20:13,819
So we can see through this 
comparison of apparent magnitudes

381
00:20:13,824 --> 00:20:17,159
and absolute magnitude, to which 
degree the distance of the stars

382
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:19,539
dominates what we perceive
from their radiation.

383
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:22,792
The challenge in astrophysics
is to imagine, to modelize

384
00:20:22,792 --> 00:20:26,137
the physical processes that account 
for the received radiation.

385
00:20:26,137 --> 00:20:28,343
This radiation can be captured

386
00:20:28,343 --> 00:20:30,663
in form of an image or a spectrum.

387
00:20:30,663 --> 00:20:32,569
It is these 
and only these,

388
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:35,586
that will permit us to understant
the fonctionning of the stars

389
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:37,546
that compose the universe.
