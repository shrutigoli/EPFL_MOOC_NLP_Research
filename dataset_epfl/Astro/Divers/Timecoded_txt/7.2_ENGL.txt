1
00:00:05,399 --> 00:00:07,589
In the previous video,
we introduced

2
00:00:07,589 --> 00:00:09,606
some basic cosmology notions

3
00:00:09,606 --> 00:00:12,280
and we tied the 
notion of red shift

4
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,606
to the expansion factor of the Universe.

5
00:00:14,606 --> 00:00:17,782
The challenge is now
to link redshifts

6
00:00:17,782 --> 00:00:19,002
to distances

7
00:00:19,002 --> 00:00:21,679
because they can be
calculated or predicted

8
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:23,800
by comological models.

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:25,659
If we can measure distances,

10
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:27,556
we can test cosmological models

11
00:00:27,556 --> 00:00:31,765
by confronting the predictions 
of the models to the observations

12
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,918
and by looking at models
which are best capable 

13
00:00:33,918 --> 00:00:37,578
to predict the measured distances.

14
00:00:37,578 --> 00:00:39,261
We will see in this video

15
00:00:39,261 --> 00:00:41,869
how to measure the distances

16
00:00:41,869 --> 00:00:44,716
and what the signification of
these distances are.

17
00:00:44,716 --> 00:00:47,975
We will see that there are essentially 
2 available methods for this : 

18
00:00:47,975 --> 00:00:51,346
one is founded on what we call
standard rulers

19
00:00:51,346 --> 00:00:54,653
and the other on standard candles.

20
00:00:54,653 --> 00:00:56,110
In the case of the standard ruler,

21
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:59,180
the principle is to measure
how the angular size of an object 

22
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:01,651
varies with the red shift.

23
00:01:01,651 --> 00:01:05,653
If also know the physical
size of this standard object,

24
00:01:05,653 --> 00:01:07,174
we know its distance.

25
00:01:07,174 --> 00:01:09,081
It's what is drawn here

26
00:01:09,081 --> 00:01:11,822
where we see a galaxy
with an intrinsic size

27
00:01:11,822 --> 00:01:13,078
and an apparent size.

28
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:15,818
The intrinsic size will not change
with the distance,

29
00:01:15,818 --> 00:01:18,698
but the measured size,
the angular size of the sky

30
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:22,210
will change and it's like this that we 
will be able to measure the distance.

31
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:24,152
We can hold the same logic

32
00:01:24,152 --> 00:01:27,806
and measure the apparent luminosity 
of an object of which we would know also

33
00:01:27,806 --> 00:01:31,124
the intrinsic luminosity, i.e.,
the absolute magnitude.

34
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:34,282
It's what is shown here: a standard candle

35
00:01:34,282 --> 00:01:36,530
with a well defined 
intrinsic luminosity

36
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:42,322
whose apparent luminosity will diminish
with the red shift and the distance. 

37
00:01:42,322 --> 00:01:45,426
It's thanks to these standard rulers
and standard candles

38
00:01:45,426 --> 00:01:48,706
that we can link the red shifts

39
00:01:48,706 --> 00:01:51,991
to the distances and make 
cosmological measurements.

40
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:54,357
What are we searching 
for in cosmology ?

41
00:01:54,357 --> 00:01:57,199
We are trying to establish a connection 

42
00:01:57,199 --> 00:02:00,458
between redshifts

43
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:03,023
and the time that passes
after the Big Bang.

44
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:08,422
So the time after the Big
Bang is summarized in this slide :

45
00:02:08,422 --> 00:02:13,519
we have here the time 
beginning at time "zero".

46
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:17,693
The beginning of time is the 
Big Bang, which is around here.

47
00:02:17,693 --> 00:02:20,487
and then time passes after
the Big Bang :

48
00:02:20,487 --> 00:02:23,412
we arrive here for example
at a red-shift of 4

49
00:02:23,412 --> 00:02:26,820
which corresponds to 1,5
billion years after the Big Bang.

50
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,751
So time flows in this direction.

51
00:02:28,751 --> 00:02:34,596
At present time, we are around
13,8 billion years

52
00:02:35,086 --> 00:02:39,247
and we will try to establish a 
connection between the redshift

53
00:02:39,247 --> 00:02:42,971
and time after the Big Bang, 
so the distance.

54
00:02:42,971 --> 00:02:46,182
To do that, we need more and
more powerful observatories

55
00:02:46,182 --> 00:02:49,736
So here we have the evolution in 
time of different observatories.

56
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:53,068
Here's the Mount Palomar observatory
with a 5m telescope in diameter

57
00:02:53,068 --> 00:02:56,375
which allowed to reach redshifts of the order of 1

58
00:02:56,375 --> 00:03:00,675
with cameras that had 
the sensitivity of the 90s.

59
00:03:00,675 --> 00:03:03,665
Then from space with more and 
more sensitive cameras,

60
00:03:03,665 --> 00:03:06,993
as more and more servicing missions
to the space telescope allowed

61
00:03:06,993 --> 00:03:12,055
to replace the cameras that 
were used with the telescope.

62
00:03:12,055 --> 00:03:15,381
We were able to go to
ever greater distances.

63
00:03:15,381 --> 00:03:19,362
Here, we see that we added the
infra red. Why?

64
00:03:19,362 --> 00:03:22,544
Simply because the spectrum
of the galaxies we try to observe, 

65
00:03:22,544 --> 00:03:24,496
will be more and
more red shifted

66
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,377
to the point of reaching the infra red domain.

67
00:03:26,377 --> 00:03:28,420
We therefore need 
infra red detectors 

68
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:32,468
if we want to observe at
extremely large distances.

69
00:03:32,468 --> 00:03:34,275
That is the actual space telescope

70
00:03:34,275 --> 00:03:37,122
with optical and infra-red detectors.

71
00:03:37,122 --> 00:03:41,205
and then there is the next generation space 
telescope, the James Webb space telescope,

72
00:03:41,205 --> 00:03:44,206
which will have only infra-red detectors.

73
00:03:44,206 --> 00:03:47,494
It will be able to see 
extremely distant galaxies.

74
00:03:47,494 --> 00:03:52,117
The diameter of the James Webb telescope
is also much bigger,

75
00:03:52,117 --> 00:03:56,360
three times the actual 
space telescope diameter

76
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,567
which has a diameter of 2,4 meters.

77
00:04:00,447 --> 00:04:04,418
What we try to do in
observational cosmology,

78
00:04:04,418 --> 00:04:06,494
is to use the fondamental relation

79
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:10,399
we established in 
the previous video.

80
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:16,602
between the redshift z 
or actually 1+z

81
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:21,766
and the expansion factor
of the universe α(t)

82
00:04:21,766 --> 00:04:26,473
and what we can measure: the
cosmological red shift

83
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:28,687
measured by Doppler effect.

84
00:04:28,687 --> 00:04:31,538
That is the wavelength of an 
object as we would observe it

85
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:35,274
and that is the emission 
wavelength of a signal

86
00:04:35,274 --> 00:04:39,332
in the object's frame of reference
that emitted the signal.

87
00:04:39,332 --> 00:04:43,545
The cosmological models give
us the possibility to determine

88
00:04:43,545 --> 00:04:48,839
the distance to the objects,  
which will be a function

89
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:53,126
of the red shift or
the expansion factor,

90
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,796
and the cosmological parameters.

91
00:04:56,796 --> 00:05:02,357
These cosmological parameters 
will be essentially <i>H zero</i>

92
00:05:02,357 --> 00:05:08,311
but also the density of the
different components of the universe. 

93
00:05:08,311 --> 00:05:14,916
These components will include 
the repulsive dark energy

94
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:19,698
which is responsible for the 
accelerated expansion of the universe

95
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:21,400
and dark matter.

96
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,412
Now how to define the distances ?

97
00:05:25,412 --> 00:05:28,673
I said that we have standard rulers
and standard candles.

98
00:05:28,673 --> 00:05:35,009
For standard rulers,
we will suppose that we have an object

99
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:39,286
of which we know the intrinsic radius

100
00:05:39,286 --> 00:05:45,520
and then we observe this object at
a given distance <i>d</i> from us

101
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:48,169
and this object will
underlie a solid angle,

102
00:05:48,169 --> 00:05:54,955
the object has a given radius, which
underlies a certain solid angle <i>ω</i>

103
00:05:54,955 --> 00:05:58,176
it is at a given distances from us,
and that is of interest

104
00:05:58,176 --> 00:06:00,735
and we will have a relation 
between these three quantities.

105
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,447
It's simply the relation

106
00:06:02,447 --> 00:06:05,507
between the solid angle 
and the radius of the object :

107
00:06:05,507 --> 00:06:11,241
ω (the solid angle) will be equal to
πR² (R is the radius of the star)

108
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:14,139
and D is the distance that we
are interested in.

109
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:16,264
So by measuring the solid angle,

110
00:06:16,264 --> 00:06:19,661
if we know the intrinsic 
radius of the object,

111
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:25,098
we get the distance we will
call the angular diameter distance,

112
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:36,152
DA(z) will be equal to the square root of 
πR² over w (w is an angle).

113
00:06:36,152 --> 00:06:40,222
This is what we call 
angular diameter distance.

114
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:46,019
We also said that we have
standard candles.

115
00:06:46,019 --> 00:06:49,579
If we look at what happens at 
the level of the standard candles,

116
00:06:49,579 --> 00:06:52,146
how we will define the distance?

117
00:06:53,426 --> 00:06:55,092
If we have a standard candle,

118
00:06:55,092 --> 00:06:57,631
we do not have anymore a stellar 
object with a well known,

119
00:06:57,631 --> 00:06:59,150
well callibrated, well determined radius

120
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:04,047
but we have a certain luminosity
which will be the standard luminosity.

121
00:07:04,047 --> 00:07:08,823
We have already seen how to
measure the flux of an object

122
00:07:08,823 --> 00:07:11,669
with a certain well known luminosity <i>L</i>

123
00:07:11,669 --> 00:07:19,632
the object has an isotropic radiation
at a certain distance <i>D</i> from itself

124
00:07:19,632 --> 00:07:24,375
and sends us a flux diluted
over a sphere like this

125
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,758
and the flux is simply

126
00:07:26,758 --> 00:07:31,775
F is equal to L / (4πD²)

127
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:35,174
This allows us to define
a second distance.

128
00:07:35,174 --> 00:07:36,952
If we measure the flux of an object,

129
00:07:36,952 --> 00:07:39,132
we know its intrinsic luminosity.

130
00:07:39,132 --> 00:07:42,432
We deduce from it the distance
we call the luminosity distance

131
00:07:42,432 --> 00:07:45,356
which depends on z
(red shift)

132
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:48,182
measured by the Doppler effect,

133
00:07:48,182 --> 00:07:54,176
so we will have D equal to L
over 4π times the measured flux.

134
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:57,838
This is what we call 
the luminosity distance.

135
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:02,554
So we have two possible
definitions of the distance,

136
00:08:02,554 --> 00:08:05,891
one based on standard rulers,

137
00:08:05,891 --> 00:08:09,019
and the other on 
standard candles.

138
00:08:09,019 --> 00:08:12,999
So objects that have either a
well known size

139
00:08:12,999 --> 00:08:15,143
or a well known luminosity.

140
00:08:15,143 --> 00:08:17,878
It's like this that
we will define distances.

141
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:20,696
So let's see how the models

142
00:08:20,696 --> 00:08:23,518
(we use a given cosmological model

143
00:08:23,518 --> 00:08:25,395
without giving the details of this model),

144
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:29,651
here the curves that link the redshifts

145
00:08:29,651 --> 00:08:34,345
to the distances in this case
luminosity distances

146
00:08:34,345 --> 00:08:37,642
and in this case angular
diameter distances.

147
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,595
We have two types of distances.

148
00:08:39,595 --> 00:08:42,727
In the case of luminosity distances

149
00:08:42,727 --> 00:08:50,341
we have DL(z) equal to the 
square root of L over 4πF

150
00:08:50,341 --> 00:08:53,146
If we know an object of luminosity L

151
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:56,061
and place it a different redshifts,

152
00:08:56,061 --> 00:08:58,493
we will measure a given flux

153
00:08:58,493 --> 00:09:00,082
and deduce a given distance.

154
00:09:00,082 --> 00:09:03,306
This is the predicted distance
by a certain cosmological model.

155
00:09:03,306 --> 00:09:08,844
We have the angular diameter 
distance on one side,

156
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:15,540
which will be equal to πR²,
so the intrinsic radius,

157
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:20,651
which we are supposed to 
get by an independent method,

158
00:09:20,651 --> 00:09:26,043
and the solid angle which underlays the object.

159
00:09:26,623 --> 00:09:28,664
We see that we do not have the same relations,

160
00:09:28,664 --> 00:09:30,598
we do not have the same curves. 

161
00:09:30,598 --> 00:09:33,706
We have in fact a relation between
the different distances,

162
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:44,067
we have DL(z) = (1 + z) ² times DA(z)

163
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,256
it's for this that the
curves are different.

164
00:09:46,256 --> 00:09:48,264
They are different but 
not incompatible .

165
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:51,020
We just have two ways
of defining distances.

166
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,439
It's important to define
how we look at distances :

167
00:09:53,439 --> 00:09:56,605
either with angular diameter distances,

168
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:59,073
or with luminosity distances.

169
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:03,503
In both case, we have to confront 
the correct observations,

170
00:10:03,503 --> 00:10:05,408
to the correct theoretical predictions.

171
00:10:05,408 --> 00:10:09,163
Here we have models that predict
luminosities or apparent fluxes.

172
00:10:09,163 --> 00:10:15,896
Here we have models that predict
apparent solid angles

173
00:10:15,896 --> 00:10:18,270
for reference objects.

174
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:20,509
It's important to know
what distance we are talking about.

175
00:10:20,509 --> 00:10:23,071
There is also something that 
might seem counterintuitive :

176
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:28,852
in the case of luminosity distances,
an objects gets fainter and fainter

177
00:10:28,852 --> 00:10:33,411
as the red shift gets higher.

178
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:39,842
Here when the red shift goes up,
the angular diameter distance to an object

179
00:10:39,842 --> 00:10:42,043
will get to a peak and then go down.

180
00:10:42,043 --> 00:10:46,279
This means in practice: ω the 
apparent diameter or apparent radius

181
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,410
of an object in the sky,
when its red shift gets higher

182
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:55,163
the apparent diameter will first go down

183
00:10:57,293 --> 00:11:04,720
ω goes down, and then goes up 
in this part here of the curve .

184
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,717
An object that we will
put further and further

185
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:10,850
will have the tendency of getting
bigger and bigger in appearance. 

186
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:14,555
However, its apparent luminosity will 
continue to diminish. 

187
00:11:14,555 --> 00:11:18,975
and the distances are linked by
this equation here.

188
00:11:19,825 --> 00:11:23,187
Now we will concentrate
on the standard candle methods

189
00:11:23,187 --> 00:11:25,412
to measure distances.

190
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:32,706
We will link the velocity to the distances,
with  Hubble's law,

191
00:11:32,706 --> 00:11:36,111
valid for small shifts up,
small z

192
00:11:36,111 --> 00:11:42,332
or in other words we will try to link
the distances to a function

193
00:11:42,332 --> 00:11:45,962
of cosmology (z) and 
cosmological parameters. 

194
00:11:45,962 --> 00:11:48,651
Here z is measured by Doppler effect.

195
00:11:48,651 --> 00:11:51,341
Cosmology are the parameters 
of a model

196
00:11:51,341 --> 00:11:54,525
and when we change these parameters,
we change the prediction of these models.

197
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:58,068
D is what we try to measure
with standard candles.

198
00:11:58,068 --> 00:12:03,850
We have a very useful tool for that: 
the distance module μ

199
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:09,360
the difference between the apparent magnitude
and the absolute magnitude of an object

200
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,586
which is equal to 5 times the 
log to the distance/sec minus 5

201
00:12:15,812 --> 00:12:19,039
So the method is very simple
from here on:

202
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:25,223
if M is known,
(for a standard candle)

203
00:12:25,223 --> 00:12:34,347
and if m is measured, then we 
can deduce the distance.

204
00:12:35,547 --> 00:12:38,247
The standard candle method
is extremely simple :

205
00:12:38,247 --> 00:12:39,831
we use the distance modulus

206
00:12:39,831 --> 00:12:43,936
we measure it by measuring 
the apparent magnitude of a celestial body

207
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:46,434
of which we know also the
absolute magnitude

208
00:12:46,434 --> 00:12:47,946
and we get the distance.

209
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:50,966
There are a series of objects
which we can consider

210
00:12:50,966 --> 00:12:53,007
as standard chandles.

211
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:56,974
The most famous are the cepheides stars

212
00:12:56,974 --> 00:12:58,916
and we will also see the supernovae. 

213
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:00,461
First the Cepheid stars :

214
00:13:00,461 --> 00:13:05,061
are gigantic stars that 
are extremely bright,

215
00:13:05,061 --> 00:13:09,504
so we can them from far away
and they will be pulsating. 

216
00:13:10,474 --> 00:13:15,416
If they pulsate, their radius 
varies periodically.

217
00:13:15,416 --> 00:13:20,887
We have the famous relation
L = 4πR²σT4

218
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:26,358
If the radius varies, the temperature
also varies a little bit

219
00:13:26,358 --> 00:13:30,197
but it's the luminosity
in the end that will vary. 

220
00:13:31,547 --> 00:13:36,090
There is a relation between
the period and the luminosity 

221
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,143
of the Cepheid stars.

222
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:40,986
If I show you this on a graph :

223
00:13:40,986 --> 00:13:48,061
here is what could be the absolute
magnitude of a Cepheid star,

224
00:13:48,061 --> 00:13:50,245
the time is here,

225
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:56,851
and the light curve
of the Cepheid star.

226
00:13:57,981 --> 00:14:00,344
We have a given mean value,

227
00:14:00,344 --> 00:14:02,770
we have a mean m,

228
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,582
we also have a period

229
00:14:05,582 --> 00:14:10,899
and the Cepheid stars also have a link

230
00:14:10,899 --> 00:14:14,312
between their absolute average
magnitude and the period.

231
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:19,463
So we have an average m which is
equal to a function of the period.

232
00:14:19,463 --> 00:14:25,214
Also the luminosity grows with P

233
00:14:25,584 --> 00:14:29,313
So M decreases with P
because it's in magnitude

234
00:14:29,313 --> 00:14:33,693
and the exact relation is
m average in the v band

235
00:14:33,693 --> 00:14:46,071
is equal to minus 2,43 times (the decimal
logarithm of the period - 1) minus 4,05

236
00:14:46,201 --> 00:14:51,295
This means that if we measure
for example observational points,

237
00:14:51,295 --> 00:14:53,520
on a curve like this.

238
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:56,754
I take a galaxy in which there 
is a Cepheid star,

239
00:14:56,754 --> 00:14:59,569
I regularly measure its photometry 

240
00:14:59,569 --> 00:15:02,300
and then I will have what I
call the light curve.

241
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:05,390
I will be able to measure the period
and so have the absolute magnitude

242
00:15:05,390 --> 00:15:07,908
that I will be able to inject
in the distance module.

243
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:11,689
Here is again the formula
of the distance modulus:

244
00:15:11,689 --> 00:15:17,210
we will be able to inject m average here
in the formula of the distance modulus

245
00:15:17,210 --> 00:15:19,744
and get the distance.

246
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:23,587
It's a relation that was
first measured

247
00:15:23,587 --> 00:15:30,813
by Henrietta Leavitt, in
the years 1910-1920.

248
00:15:30,813 --> 00:15:33,903
It's not something recent
but it's only recently

249
00:15:33,903 --> 00:15:38,522
that we could apply this method
with the Hubble space telescope

250
00:15:38,522 --> 00:15:41,122
to measure distances
to galaxies

251
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:44,934
to around 40 - 50 megaparsec from us.

252
00:15:45,204 --> 00:15:48,697
There are some very well known stars
that are Cepheid stars :

253
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:55,896
obviously the δ Cephei star
which is the archetype of Cepheid stars

254
00:15:55,896 --> 00:15:58,437
but the polar star is also
a Cepheid star 

255
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:02,780
The star towards which the rotation axis
of the earth points, the polar star,

256
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:05,660
is a pulsating Cepheid star.

257
00:16:09,160 --> 00:16:12,320
As I said before, we
used the space telescope

258
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,439
to observe the Cepheid stars.

259
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:20,277
We also need to separate the stars
in the Messier 31 galaxy in this case here,

260
00:16:20,277 --> 00:16:22,981
to distinguish between the 
Cepheids and other stars.

261
00:16:22,981 --> 00:16:25,559
I said that Cepheid are 
very bright, here is one

262
00:16:25,559 --> 00:16:28,959
If we measure the luminous flux
of that Cepheid star in time,

263
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:32,287
we see that from here to here
the star has grown in brightness.

264
00:16:32,287 --> 00:16:34,881
We measure the light curve,
we measure the period,

265
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:37,237
and we deduce the absolute magnitude.

266
00:16:37,237 --> 00:16:48,304
For the Andromeda galaxy, the 
measured distance is 778 +/- 17 kg/sec

267
00:16:48,304 --> 00:16:52,417
and the recession velocity 
measured by Doppler effect

268
00:16:52,417 --> 00:16:57,537
is around 301 +/- 7 km/s,

269
00:16:57,537 --> 00:17:02,639
so the Andromeda galaxy flees from us
at an approximate velocity of 300 km per second.

270
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:06,944
We know other standard candles 
which will be

271
00:17:06,944 --> 00:17:09,987
even brighter, so we will
see them from even further away :

272
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:13,026
which will be type 1a supernovae

273
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:17,094
I'll skip the details here on
how supernovae work.

274
00:17:17,094 --> 00:17:22,302
They are two types.
Type 1 supernovae stars :

275
00:17:22,302 --> 00:17:30,530
those are white dwarfs
which are in orbit

276
00:17:30,530 --> 00:17:36,662
around a common gravity centre 
with giant or super giant stars.

277
00:17:36,662 --> 00:17:39,502
Matter will go from the giant 
to the white dwarf

278
00:17:39,502 --> 00:17:41,451
and matter will accrete. 

279
00:17:41,451 --> 00:17:44,676
After some time, we will
have a sufficient critical mass

280
00:17:44,676 --> 00:17:47,234
for a supernova explosion.

281
00:17:47,234 --> 00:17:49,745
This is a type of supernova 
i haven't talked about 

282
00:17:49,745 --> 00:17:51,263
in the previous videos.

283
00:17:51,263 --> 00:17:54,477
What we had until now,
were type 2 supernovae

284
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:58,853
which we call core-collapse supernovae.

285
00:18:01,453 --> 00:18:04,367
We have seen that for
massive stars

286
00:18:04,367 --> 00:18:08,359
we have nuclear reactions
up to the iron fusion reaction

287
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:10,303
which takes place from here on,

288
00:18:10,303 --> 00:18:14,363
the iron reaction being endothermic
the core of the star collapses

289
00:18:14,363 --> 00:18:17,813
and we have a supernova explosion.

290
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:20,331
This is what we saw in
the previous chapter.

291
00:18:20,331 --> 00:18:22,618
chapter 5 on stellar evolution.

292
00:18:22,618 --> 00:18:27,060
The supernovae of interest for us are
type 1 a supernovae,

293
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:34,592
which are fact white dwarfs, so binary
stars, white dwarfs,

294
00:18:34,592 --> 00:18:37,799
around a giant

295
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:43,037
and matter will fall, attracted by
the white dwarf,

296
00:18:43,037 --> 00:18:45,079
spiral around the white dwarf

297
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:48,282
and so accrete matter

298
00:18:48,282 --> 00:18:49,437
After some time,

299
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:52,782
we will reach the critical
mass of the white dwarf,

300
00:18:56,192 --> 00:19:02,209
the critical mass is 
1,44 Solar Mass

301
00:19:02,209 --> 00:19:04,731
also called the Chandrasekhar mass.

302
00:19:07,251 --> 00:19:11,415
Each time the white dwarf has
accreted enough matter,

303
00:19:11,415 --> 00:19:14,131
that is 1,44 times the mass of the sun,

304
00:19:14,131 --> 00:19:18,859
we will have a supernova detonation.

305
00:19:20,949 --> 00:19:25,143
Since the critical mass is always the same
we will always have the same luminosity.

306
00:19:27,853 --> 00:19:31,319
Actually it's the explosion peak that will
always have the same luminosity.

307
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:34,803
What is of interests here
is what we call

308
00:19:34,803 --> 00:19:39,424
the light curve of the supernova
as in the Cepheid stars case.

309
00:19:39,424 --> 00:19:43,004
But this time on the axes
we have the time here

310
00:19:43,004 --> 00:19:48,086
the luminosity here, and also
the absolute magnitude that would be here.

311
00:19:48,086 --> 00:19:51,649
When the supernova explodes,
it will grow in luminosity,

312
00:19:51,649 --> 00:19:55,337
reach a peak and then go down.

313
00:19:55,337 --> 00:20:01,459
If we calibrate this curve, we 
will see that at a given moment,

314
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:08,923
we have a luminosity peak
that 

315
00:20:08,923 --> 00:20:14,605
will correspond to an absolute
magnitude in the v band of -19,3

316
00:20:14,605 --> 00:20:18,706
So when a supernova explodes, we
take some measurement points,

317
00:20:19,736 --> 00:20:22,010
we have a light curve,

318
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:27,033
we make the adjustment by least 
square over the light curve,

319
00:20:27,033 --> 00:20:30,976
we measure the peak and that gives
us the absolute magnitude in the v band

320
00:20:30,976 --> 00:20:33,973
another time, that is what 
we will inject in the distance modulus

321
00:20:33,973 --> 00:20:37,373
to determine the distance
to the supernova.

322
00:20:37,853 --> 00:20:40,008
Here are some supernovae examples :

323
00:20:40,008 --> 00:20:44,264
here we have a spiral galaxy
at a relatively short distance.

324
00:20:44,264 --> 00:20:49,656
We have here the distance C
measured through supernovae

325
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:56,980
of 15,5 +/- 0,6 megaparsec

326
00:20:56,980 --> 00:20:59,369
that is already a lot
further away than the Andromeda galaxy.

327
00:20:59,369 --> 00:21:02,306
We would not be able to see
Cepheids in a galaxy like this.

328
00:21:02,306 --> 00:21:05,164
The recession velocity here is 
much larger : 602

329
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:10,958
so exactly twice that of Andromeda

330
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:14,083
so 602 km per second

331
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:17,359
and if we take a spectrum 
of that supernova

332
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:21,032
we will find that there
is no hydrogen line.

333
00:21:23,012 --> 00:21:30,069
Instead we will have silicium II, i.e.,
silicium ionized once,

334
00:21:30,069 --> 00:21:34,072
that can be found at 
the wavelength 6150 Å

335
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:36,162
It's these two caracteristics

336
00:21:36,162 --> 00:21:40,567
that are the spectral signatures
of type 1a supernovae.

337
00:21:40,567 --> 00:21:42,805
When a supernova explodes,
we can do two things :

338
00:21:42,805 --> 00:21:44,812
we take a spectrum, we look
if there is no hydrogen

339
00:21:44,812 --> 00:21:46,189
and if there is silicium

340
00:21:46,189 --> 00:21:52,234
and we measure the light curve
to get the apparent magnitude 

341
00:21:52,234 --> 00:21:56,345
of the supernova, which will worrespond
to a given absolute magnitude.

342
00:21:56,345 --> 00:21:58,833
So we will have the 
distance modulus

343
00:21:58,833 --> 00:22:02,728
and the distance to the galaxy 
where the supernova is.

344
00:22:03,728 --> 00:22:07,690
Here is another galaxy
NGC 3370

345
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:11,197
The distance is beginning 
to be a bit higher :

346
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:14,160
we have a distance of around 30 megaparsec

347
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,032
We have here an observation taken
by a ground telescope,

348
00:22:17,032 --> 00:22:18,815
with a supernova that exploded,

349
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:21,559
and an observation taken
with the spatial telescope

350
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:24,529
with the supernova before or
after the explosion

351
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:27,358
in any case not present on the image.

352
00:22:27,358 --> 00:22:31,081
The recession velocity of this galaxy
is even higher than the others :

353
00:22:32,504 --> 00:22:36,317
1279 km per second for this one

354
00:22:37,807 --> 00:22:40,065
Now if we go even further,

355
00:22:40,065 --> 00:22:44,324
we'll be able to see the true
usefulness of the supernovae tool

356
00:22:44,324 --> 00:22:47,351
We have galaxies at a red 
shift of around 1,

357
00:22:47,351 --> 00:22:48,893
the red shift is around 1

358
00:22:48,893 --> 00:22:51,761
and we have different supernovae here :

359
00:22:51,761 --> 00:22:54,244
we see an extremely bright one here.

360
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:56,259
In fact many times brighter
than the galaxy

361
00:22:56,259 --> 00:22:59,391
in which the supernova is, 
which we barely see.

362
00:22:59,391 --> 00:23:03,086
We have another here which is
in an interacting galaxy.

363
00:23:03,086 --> 00:23:08,706
Another one here, with a relatively
blue supernova spectrum.

364
00:23:10,448 --> 00:23:12,126
And here another one.

365
00:23:12,126 --> 00:23:14,781
So thanks to these supernovae

366
00:23:14,781 --> 00:23:17,545
we will be able to measure the distances
to all these galaxies.

367
00:23:17,545 --> 00:23:19,963
The further we go,
the better we will test

368
00:23:19,963 --> 00:23:21,299
the cosmological models.

369
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:26,365
What will be important here, thanks
to the Cepheids or supernovae,

370
00:23:26,365 --> 00:23:28,963
is to construct what is
called a Hubble diagram.

371
00:23:28,963 --> 00:23:31,748
This Hubble diagram links
the distance modulus

372
00:23:31,748 --> 00:23:33,740
to the red shift.

373
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:37,186
Here is how one of these
diagrams looks like :

374
00:23:37,186 --> 00:23:40,592
these are not observations
or predictions.

375
00:23:40,592 --> 00:23:44,031
It's just a qualitative schematic.

376
00:23:44,031 --> 00:23:47,432
We will have here a red shift.

377
00:23:47,432 --> 00:23:52,217
Here the distance module m minus M

378
00:23:52,217 --> 00:23:57,549
So for the Cepheids, we measure 
the mean apparent magnitude

379
00:23:57,549 --> 00:24:01,784
and we know, thanks to the
period-luminosity relation,

380
00:24:01,784 --> 00:24:03,466
the absolute magnitude.

381
00:24:03,466 --> 00:24:05,912
For a supernova, we know 
the absolute magnitude

382
00:24:05,912 --> 00:24:08,310
of the luminosity peak at the explosion.

383
00:24:08,310 --> 00:24:13,817
We measure the apparent magnitude
of the explosion peak

384
00:24:13,817 --> 00:24:16,054
and obtain the distance modulus.

385
00:24:16,054 --> 00:24:19,959
Now we of course have
theoretical predictions.

386
00:24:20,529 --> 00:24:22,848
I draw like this,

387
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:27,313
theoretical models which
link the red shift

388
00:24:27,313 --> 00:24:29,535
to the distance modulus.

389
00:24:29,535 --> 00:24:36,447
Then, we have to take sufficiently
precise observational points

390
00:24:36,447 --> 00:24:39,555
to be able to discriminate between
the different cosmological models.

391
00:24:39,555 --> 00:24:45,221
We can already see here that
the further one goes in red shift,

392
00:24:45,221 --> 00:24:47,820
the more one will be able to discriminate 
between the different models.

393
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:52,856
If I take points too close to us

394
00:24:52,856 --> 00:24:55,805
we will not be able to discriminate 
between the cosmological models,

395
00:24:55,805 --> 00:24:57,216
while there we can do it.

396
00:24:57,216 --> 00:24:59,989
Of course it is harder
to measure distant points

397
00:24:59,989 --> 00:25:02,465
since we need bigger telescopes

398
00:25:02,465 --> 00:25:05,560
but we also test the cosmology better.

399
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:10,408
The prediction of the models,
the difference between the curves,

400
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:14,115
will be the cosmological 
parameters so H zero

401
00:25:14,115 --> 00:25:18,689
but also the different energy
density parameters.

402
00:25:18,689 --> 00:25:23,348
70% dark energy,
25% dark matter

403
00:25:24,028 --> 00:25:28,436
and 5% baryonic matter
or normal matter.

404
00:25:28,436 --> 00:25:31,026
So the difference between 
these models here,

405
00:25:31,026 --> 00:25:37,219
are the proportions
of these different densities.

406
00:25:37,219 --> 00:25:40,651
If we manage to measure μ and z,

407
00:25:40,651 --> 00:25:43,527
we can differentiate between
the different cosmological models.

408
00:25:43,987 --> 00:25:47,129
Since the years 2000, we know 
that we live in an universe

409
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:51,649
in accelerated expansion, so we were able to
discriminate between the different curves

410
00:25:51,649 --> 00:25:54,030
in these Hubble diagrams.

411
00:25:54,350 --> 00:25:57,759
A word about what we call 
the distance scale :

412
00:25:57,759 --> 00:26:02,282
we have seen that we have different 
methods to measure distances.

413
00:26:03,422 --> 00:26:06,168
The goal is to go to
high red shifts.

414
00:26:06,168 --> 00:26:09,955
We have high red shifts,
large distances here

415
00:26:10,585 --> 00:26:14,126
We are somewhere in the 
Milky Way.

416
00:26:14,126 --> 00:26:18,252
Then we can measure parallaxes 
in the Milky Way.

417
00:26:19,962 --> 00:26:27,877
We will be able to go to distances
of around 40-50 megaparsec.

418
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:31,329
We will be able to use Cepheids.

419
00:26:32,629 --> 00:26:36,703
and then further, we will use 
supernovae

420
00:26:37,703 --> 00:26:42,076
We have a certain number
of inter calibration zones, let's say :

421
00:26:42,776 --> 00:26:49,339
for example here a zone where we 
have measured parallaxes

422
00:26:49,339 --> 00:26:51,428
for Cepheid stars.

423
00:26:51,428 --> 00:26:54,711
So we will be able to establish
a period liuminosity relation

424
00:26:54,711 --> 00:26:58,076
for Cepheids by measuring
their distances with parallaxes.

425
00:26:58,926 --> 00:27:03,624
Then we have a zone here
where we have galaxies

426
00:27:03,624 --> 00:27:05,655
in which we have Cepheids.

427
00:27:07,085 --> 00:27:13,267
From time to time these galaxies
will have a type 1a supernova

428
00:27:13,267 --> 00:27:17,124
These are very rare,
each galaxy has around

429
00:27:17,124 --> 00:27:20,596
one type 1a supernova per century.

430
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:22,578
So these objects are extremely rare,

431
00:27:22,578 --> 00:27:25,003
we know of approximately 10
at the present time. 

432
00:27:25,003 --> 00:27:29,157
It's thanks to this that will be
able to correctly calibrate the relation

433
00:27:29,157 --> 00:27:35,397
between the supernova 
luminosity at their peak

434
00:27:35,397 --> 00:27:38,062
and the distance.

435
00:27:39,632 --> 00:27:42,001
Further away we use 
only supernovae

436
00:27:42,001 --> 00:27:43,894
as distance indicators.

437
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:46,221
We have three essential indicators :

438
00:27:46,221 --> 00:27:48,839
parallaxes, Cepheids, supernovae

439
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:51,393
which will be calibrated between each other

440
00:27:51,393 --> 00:27:54,918
in some zones where we have 
two different indicators available at the same time

441
00:27:54,918 --> 00:27:57,026
and then at a larger red shift,

442
00:27:57,026 --> 00:27:59,914
we only have access to extremely
bright supernovae

443
00:27:59,914 --> 00:28:03,320
allowing us to go very far 
in our distance measurements.

444
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,860
We have seen how crucial,

445
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,187
it is important to measure
distances in the universe.

446
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,766
it's one of the rare methods
in fact the only one

447
00:28:11,766 --> 00:28:13,363
we have at our disposition 

448
00:28:13,363 --> 00:28:15,824
to test the cosmological parameters,

449
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:18,228
the parameters of the models

450
00:28:18,228 --> 00:28:21,630
which describe the relation
between red shift on the one hand,

451
00:28:21,630 --> 00:28:23,942
measured by the Doppler effect,

452
00:28:23,942 --> 00:28:25,134
and the distance on the other hand,

453
00:28:25,134 --> 00:28:28,306
so what we predict through
cosmological models.

454
00:28:28,306 --> 00:28:30,848
there are a given number
of obstacles to this

455
00:28:30,848 --> 00:28:33,589
but fortunately they
are not insurmountable. 

456
00:28:33,589 --> 00:28:35,228
What we need in practice

457
00:28:35,228 --> 00:28:37,467
are bigger and bigger telescopes

458
00:28:37,467 --> 00:28:39,997
to capture as much light as possible

459
00:28:39,997 --> 00:28:44,046
and so see further and further 
standard candles,

460
00:28:44,046 --> 00:28:47,830
standard candles which will 
send us less and less photons

461
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,886
due to their distance.

462
00:28:49,886 --> 00:28:52,950
That is not all, we also need
ultra fine images,

463
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:54,274
at very high resolution,

464
00:28:54,274 --> 00:28:58,928
as shown here, a galaxy taken
with the Hubble space telescope. 

465
00:28:58,928 --> 00:29:01,143
In these images, we will be able

466
00:29:01,143 --> 00:29:04,279
by zooming, to isolate
interesting objects

467
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,485
from the surrounding objects.

468
00:29:05,485 --> 00:29:07,552
For example we will be able to see 

469
00:29:07,552 --> 00:29:09,889
the image of standard
Cepheid candles

470
00:29:09,889 --> 00:29:13,780
a crowded stellar neighbourhood.

471
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:17,470
In this sense, the
Hubble space telescope is 

472
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:20,262
absolutely crucial for 
cosmology.
