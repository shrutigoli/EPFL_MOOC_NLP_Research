1
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,259
In this video we will see with
more details what a comet is.

2
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:09,855
They are very small bodies

3
00:00:09,855 --> 00:00:12,415
with a diameter not much larger 
than a few kilometres

4
00:00:12,416 --> 00:00:14,810
and composed of 80%
of water ice

5
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,450
as well as organic compounds

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:19,787
such as carbon, hydrogen,
oxygen and nitrogen. 

7
00:00:20,822 --> 00:00:23,798
Comets come from a
large spherical cloud

8
00:00:24,045 --> 00:00:26,857
at the limit of the solar system,
known as

9
00:00:26,857 --> 00:00:28,168
the Oort Cloud,

10
00:00:28,168 --> 00:00:30,013
named after the Dutch astronomer

11
00:00:30,013 --> 00:00:32,873
who first suggested its existence.

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:36,305
The spherical geometry of the cloud
and its supposed size

13
00:00:36,305 --> 00:00:38,346
of the order of 100'000 
astronomical units,

14
00:00:38,346 --> 00:00:40,676
that is, 100'000 times the 
size of the Earth orbit,

15
00:00:40,899 --> 00:00:44,122
are deduced from the fact
that the orbits of comets have

16
00:00:44,122 --> 00:00:46,982
sometimes an extreme eccentricity,
so they are extremely elongated.

17
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:49,588
They have sometimes very
long orbital periods

18
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:50,867
up to several centuries,

19
00:00:50,867 --> 00:00:53,627
such as the Halley comet with
a period of 76 years,

20
00:00:53,928 --> 00:00:57,678
and the orbital inclinations are
distributed almost randomly.

21
00:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,317
In other words, comets come

22
00:01:01,317 --> 00:01:03,437
randomly from all directions.

23
00:01:04,074 --> 00:01:06,373
At the distance of the Oort cloud,

24
00:01:06,373 --> 00:01:09,332
the gravitational forces from
stars other than the Sun

25
00:01:09,332 --> 00:01:12,252
are not negligible any more,
so that from time to time,

26
00:01:12,252 --> 00:01:14,322
a small gravitational perturbation

27
00:01:14,593 --> 00:01:17,608
caused by stars
in the Milky Way are able

28
00:01:17,608 --> 00:01:21,918
to pull a comet out of the cloud
and through it toward the Sun.

29
00:01:22,757 --> 00:01:25,393
In some way, the Oort cloud is

30
00:01:25,393 --> 00:01:27,323
a natural reservoir of comets

31
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:29,874
created at the same time
as the solar system.

32
00:01:29,877 --> 00:01:32,757
This is why the study of
comets is so essential.

33
00:01:33,141 --> 00:01:36,661
They consist in genuine fossils of
our solar system

34
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:40,018
composed of the primordial matter
that formed the planets

35
00:01:40,018 --> 00:01:42,778
and that may be at the origin of life.

36
00:01:43,794 --> 00:01:48,174
Here are two cometary nuclei visited
by the <i>NASA</i> mission <i>Deep Impact</i>.

37
00:01:48,729 --> 00:01:53,249
Left is <i>Tempel 1</i> 
with a diameter of 7.6 km

38
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:57,900
and right is <i>Hartley 2</i> with a
very small nucleus of 2.2 km wide.

39
00:01:58,396 --> 00:02:01,726
When a comet approaches the Sun,
the surface of the nucleus melts

40
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:06,453
and matter is ejected to form
large and diffuse tails

41
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:08,561
such as here with the comet <i>Hale-Bopp</i>.

42
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:13,031
You see here the blue ionised
tail, composed of gas, 

43
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:16,906
and the other one, more diffuse,
composed of dust

44
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:20,436
spreads here with
a greyish colour.

45
00:02:21,476 --> 00:02:25,137
We will see in more
details in this video

46
00:02:25,137 --> 00:02:27,627
how cometary tails are formed.

47
00:02:27,844 --> 00:02:30,704
Let us have a look at how cometary tails are formed.

48
00:02:30,704 --> 00:02:33,634
We consider a cometary particle

49
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:37,063
at the surface of the comet,
on a orbit with a period <i>P_1</i>

50
00:02:37,063 --> 00:02:40,183
at a given distance of the Sun.
Following the third Kepler's law

51
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:43,539
with the period <i>P</i> here, divided by 
the distance to the Sun <i>a</i> there.

52
00:02:43,539 --> 00:02:45,649
And <i>M</i> here is the mass of the Sun.

53
00:02:46,102 --> 00:02:49,444
We have a competition
between two forces.

54
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:52,644
On the one hand, is the
gravitational force

55
00:02:53,355 --> 00:02:55,067
acting on this grain

56
00:02:55,071 --> 00:02:58,031
and on the other hand is
the radiative pressure.

57
00:02:58,155 --> 00:03:02,575
Lets call the force created by
this radiative pressure <i>F rad</i>

58
00:03:02,935 --> 00:03:05,865
The dust grain is at equilibrium
between the two forces.

59
00:03:06,058 --> 00:03:09,726
It has a given mass, a given cross section

60
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:11,243
and therefore a given size.

61
00:03:11,243 --> 00:03:13,806
There is an opposition

62
00:03:13,806 --> 00:03:16,259
between the radiative pressure

63
00:03:16,259 --> 00:03:18,033
caused by solar photons

64
00:03:18,033 --> 00:03:20,514
collected on its 
cross section

65
00:03:20,514 --> 00:03:25,915
and the gravitational force which
also depends on the size of the grain

66
00:03:25,915 --> 00:03:27,625
through its density.

67
00:03:28,065 --> 00:03:31,112
The effect of the radiation is
proportional to <i>R²</i>,

68
00:03:31,112 --> 00:03:32,699
the particle cross section,

69
00:03:32,699 --> 00:03:36,939
and the mass is proportional to
4/3 de π R³

70
00:03:37,611 --> 00:03:39,321
where R is the
radius of the grain.

71
00:03:39,443 --> 00:03:43,163
Obviously, as soon as the
radiative pressure 

72
00:03:43,163 --> 00:03:45,262
exceeds the gravitational force,

73
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:47,962
the grain is ejected of
the surface of the comet

74
00:03:48,393 --> 00:03:51,633
and leaves then radially
with regard to the Sun.

75
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,929
When this happens, the grain
reaches another orbit

76
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:56,740
with another orbital radius.

77
00:03:57,889 --> 00:04:02,179
We see here the change of orbit.

78
00:04:02,179 --> 00:04:05,269
We push the grain, so it
leaves to another orbit

79
00:04:05,269 --> 00:04:10,609
with a period larger than the
orbital period of the comet.

80
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:13,955
Therefore the grain drifts 
behind the comet.

81
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:16,867
And now for an even
larger orbit.

82
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:20,640
By simply writing the third Kepler's law
we see that the orbital period

83
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,901
gets larger when the radius increases.

84
00:04:22,901 --> 00:04:23,676
A grain with some momentum

85
00:04:23,676 --> 00:04:29,766
given by the solar photons

86
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,370
is pushed over time to orbits of
greater radii

87
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:37,544
and therefore of greater periods.

88
00:04:37,804 --> 00:04:40,914
We have thus the formation
of a curved cometary tail.

89
00:04:41,323 --> 00:04:43,183
But there is more. We
can also have grains

90
00:04:43,775 --> 00:04:47,707
much smaller in size and as
such much lighter,

91
00:04:47,707 --> 00:04:51,436
such as molecules for example.
Molecules are immediately

92
00:04:51,436 --> 00:04:54,886
ejected outside of the orbit.

93
00:04:56,881 --> 00:05:00,011
Therefore the grains do not have
time to change orbit in

94
00:05:00,011 --> 00:05:01,367
such a continuous way.

95
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,807
They are directly swept
by the solar wind.

96
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:09,011
We were saying that there is
an opposition between

97
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:12,897
the gravitational force

98
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:17,340
and the radiative pressure,

99
00:05:19,287 --> 00:05:21,937
as well as an equilibrium
between the two forces.

100
00:05:23,646 --> 00:05:25,646
Let us write this equilibrium.

101
00:05:28,688 --> 00:05:31,278
How do we express
the radiative pressure?

102
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,520
Each photon has a given energy

103
00:05:35,643 --> 00:05:36,492
<i>E = hν</i>

104
00:05:36,492 --> 00:05:38,852
and a given momentum <i>p</i>.

105
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:42,514
Its energy can be expressed as
a function of the momentum.

106
00:05:42,514 --> 00:05:47,044
The momentum <i>p</i> associated
to each photon

107
00:05:47,153 --> 00:05:50,003
is equal to its energy
divided by the speed of light <i>c</i>.

108
00:05:50,695 --> 00:05:52,965
The radiative pressure <i>F_rad</i>

109
00:05:55,014 --> 00:06:00,192
can be written as <i>E/c</i>
since each time

110
00:06:00,192 --> 00:06:03,811
a photon is absorbed by
the dust grain

111
00:06:03,811 --> 00:06:05,951
or the molecule
on the comet

112
00:06:06,208 --> 00:06:10,418
it gains momentum 
equals to <i>E/c</i>.

113
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,265
That is, the momentum change of 
the dust grain is <i>E/c</i>,

114
00:06:14,265 --> 00:06:15,897
which is a force.

115
00:06:15,897 --> 00:06:18,357
Of course not all photons
are absorbed

116
00:06:19,082 --> 00:06:21,085
by the cometary particle.

117
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:27,357
Only the photons with an
appropriate impact parameter

118
00:06:27,357 --> 00:06:28,685
are absorbed. 

119
00:06:28,685 --> 00:06:32,794
This impact parameter is simply
the grain cross section,

120
00:06:32,794 --> 00:06:36,634
namely  <i>σ_g</i>.

121
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:45,838
Let us now compute the
different forces.

122
00:06:45,846 --> 00:06:49,466
We have first the 
gravitational force here

123
00:06:52,879 --> 00:06:55,309
and the radiative pressure.

124
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:01,650
The grain has a given cross section :

125
00:07:02,291 --> 00:07:06,991
<i>σ_g</i> = <i>π R²</i>.

126
00:07:08,099 --> 00:07:11,989
The mass of the grain is :

127
00:07:12,564 --> 00:07:18,084
<i>4/3 π R³  ρ_g</i>

128
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:20,591
where <i>ρ_g</i> is its density.

129
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:23,550
Let us now express
the different forces.

130
00:07:23,886 --> 00:07:26,746
The norm of the radiative
pressure <i>F_rad</i> is

131
00:07:27,736 --> 00:07:32,306
<i>E/c * σ_g</i>.

132
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:38,199
Now E is the solar energy
received by the grain,

133
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:41,886
so it is simply the solar luminosity <i>L</i>

134
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:45,610
over <i> 4 π r²</i>

135
00:07:45,614 --> 00:07:48,780
We have obviously the
factor <i>c</i> here

136
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:54,280
and the cross section of the grain,
<i>π R²</i>

137
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:00,090
Note the upper case R.

138
00:08:01,284 --> 00:08:03,784
Then we have the gravitational force.

139
00:08:04,947 --> 00:08:08,797
It is the gravitational force
exerted by the Sun on the grain :

140
00:08:08,797 --> 00:08:11,647
it is <i>G M</i>, where M
is the mass of the Sun,

141
00:08:11,913 --> 00:08:13,613
it is <i>G M</i>, where M
is the mass of the Sun,

142
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,686
times <i>m_g</i> the mass of the
grain that we expressed here,

143
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,269
divided by the distance between the
two bodies, <i>r²</i>

144
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:25,700
With the density expressed
previously here.

145
00:08:26,106 --> 00:08:28,276
The gravitational force

146
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:31,410
can also be written as :

147
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:36,020
<i>G M / r²</i> 

148
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:39,406
times <i>ρ_g</i> the 
grain density,

149
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:45,770
times  <i>4/3 π R³</i>,
the cube of the grain radius.

150
00:08:46,535 --> 00:08:51,655
We can now compute the
ratio between the norm

151
00:08:51,655 --> 00:08:57,488
of the gravitational force and the
norm of the radiative pressure force.

152
00:08:57,488 --> 00:08:59,808
If we rearrange all these terms,

153
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,169
we find the ratio to be :

154
00:09:01,172 --> 00:09:05,652
<i>16 π G</i> times the mass of the Sun

155
00:09:06,154 --> 00:09:09,131
times <i>R</i> the radius of the grain,

156
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,521
times its density and the
speed of light,

157
00:09:16,146 --> 00:09:19,022
over <i>3</i> times the
solar luminosity.

158
00:09:19,022 --> 00:09:22,492
We have simply expressed the
ratio by rearranging the terms

159
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,410
as functions of the quantities
that we previously defined here.

160
00:09:25,410 --> 00:09:30,329
We are of course interested in knowing
whether there is an equilibrium or not.

161
00:09:31,197 --> 00:09:34,169
We can for example deduce

162
00:09:34,169 --> 00:09:37,339
the radius of the grain that ensures equilibrium.

163
00:09:37,339 --> 00:09:41,809
We can define a critical radius

164
00:09:43,033 --> 00:09:46,667
for which a typical cometary dust

165
00:09:46,667 --> 00:09:49,286
is of roughly 2000 angströms.

166
00:09:49,286 --> 00:09:53,746
This is the maximum radius
of a dust grain

167
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:59,830
under which the grain
remains bound to the comet.

168
00:10:00,752 --> 00:10:03,336
We saw that the mass of the
grain is of the order of <i>R³</i>

169
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:05,503
while the cross section is of
the order of  <i>R²</i>.

170
00:10:05,503 --> 00:10:07,391
When the grain gets too big,

171
00:10:07,391 --> 00:10:09,811
it becomes too heavy in
regards to its cross section

172
00:10:09,811 --> 00:10:12,172
and cannot leave the
surface of the comet anymore.

173
00:10:12,172 --> 00:10:14,808
In such a case, the solar
photons are not able to

174
00:10:14,808 --> 00:10:17,598
eject the grain from the
surface of the comet anymore.

175
00:10:18,808 --> 00:10:22,119
Here is a typical example of the
spreading of two cometary tails.

176
00:10:22,119 --> 00:10:26,569
There is first a tail of light
particules, a tail of ions,

177
00:10:29,036 --> 00:10:31,506
that are generally <i>CO+</i> ions.

178
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:34,981
These particules are extremely
light and extremely small

179
00:10:34,981 --> 00:10:39,002
so they are ejected directly out
of the orbit of the comet

180
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:40,472
by the solar photons.

181
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,865
And here is a dust tail.

182
00:10:47,075 --> 00:10:49,078
These particles are much heavier.

183
00:10:49,078 --> 00:10:52,248
It takes more time to 
transfer momentum

184
00:10:52,768 --> 00:10:56,282
from the solar photons to
the cometary particles

185
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:58,217
and therefore to change their orbit.

186
00:10:58,217 --> 00:11:01,181
It takes longer to push them away
from the orbit of the comet

187
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:03,612
and are affected
by Kepler's laws

188
00:11:03,612 --> 00:11:06,762
and therefore slowly drift
behind the comet.

189
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,954
We can see this on
another picture.

190
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:14,636
We have here the comet McNaught
imaged from the observatory

191
00:11:14,636 --> 00:11:16,786
of Cerro Paranal in Chile.

192
00:11:16,862 --> 00:11:20,122
This is where the <i>VLT</i> is located, 
the European « Very Large Telescope »

193
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:23,614
composed of four 8m telescopes
in the Andes.

194
00:11:23,614 --> 00:11:27,576
This picture is taken just
after sunset.

195
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:29,436
I draw the Sun here.

196
00:11:32,030 --> 00:11:36,640
Of course the Sun emits 
photons isotropically.

197
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:40,503
The orbit of the comet around
the Sun is roughly like that,

198
00:11:40,503 --> 00:11:43,913
or at least we can
materialize it in this way.

199
00:11:44,254 --> 00:11:47,544
And here are the radius vectors.

200
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:50,421
You remember that
these radius vectors

201
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,456
sweep out equal areas
in equal times.

202
00:11:53,456 --> 00:11:58,723
This was the second Kepler's law
that we show here as a reminder.

203
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,221
Finally we have
the solar photons

204
00:12:01,227 --> 00:12:05,517
which are produced radially
in such a way here.

205
00:12:06,848 --> 00:12:08,078
which are produced radially
in such a way here.

206
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:11,324
Two cometary tails are formed.
The ion tail

207
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,300
is in this direction.

208
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:18,304
On this picture it is very thin,
we almost cannot see it

209
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,464
but the particles are indeed
ejected in this direction,

210
00:12:22,142 --> 00:12:25,152
radially with respect to
the orbit of the comet.

211
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:27,734
The heavier particles 

212
00:12:27,734 --> 00:12:32,018
are affected more slowly over
time by the Sun's radiative pressure.

213
00:12:32,018 --> 00:12:34,616
So particles will change their orbit.

214
00:12:34,616 --> 00:12:38,293
Here is an orbit with a period <i>P_1</i>

215
00:12:38,293 --> 00:12:42,553
and here a period <i>P_2</i>
greater than  <i>P_1</i>.

216
00:12:43,047 --> 00:12:46,546
If I add another point
on the orbit there,

217
00:12:46,756 --> 00:12:50,233
it will have a period <i>P_3</i>
greater than <i>P_2</i>

218
00:12:50,233 --> 00:12:53,243
just like on the slide
we showed previously.

219
00:12:53,245 --> 00:12:57,375
Since all these orbits have
greater and greater periods,

220
00:12:57,753 --> 00:12:59,833
the cometary dust grains
are delayed 

221
00:13:00,088 --> 00:13:02,518
with respect to the cometary nucleus

222
00:13:02,805 --> 00:13:05,505
which of course stays on the
same orbit with a period <i>P_1</i>.

223
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:09,324
We have seen how
the solar photons

224
00:13:09,324 --> 00:13:12,154
can change the trajectory
of cometary particles

225
00:13:12,534 --> 00:13:15,056
through the radiative pressure.

226
00:13:15,506 --> 00:13:18,476
As many physical phenomena 
presented during this course,

227
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,730
the one we just saw while
studying comets

228
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,731
manifests itself in
several scenarios

229
00:13:23,731 --> 00:13:27,231
such as for example the
formation and life of stars.

230
00:13:27,423 --> 00:13:29,873
We will see that the 
radiative pressure

231
00:13:29,878 --> 00:13:30,874
due to the photons

232
00:13:30,874 --> 00:13:34,523
created in thermonuclear reactions
in the core of stars prevents them

233
00:13:34,523 --> 00:13:36,325
from a gravitational collapse

234
00:13:36,325 --> 00:13:39,135
and thus allow them to
shine for millions,

235
00:13:39,135 --> 00:13:41,215
or even billions of years.
