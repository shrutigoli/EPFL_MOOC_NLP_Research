1
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:10,980
In the previous video, we introduced
some basic cosmology notions

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,990
and we tied the notion of red shift
to the expansion factor of the Universe.

3
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:20,369
The challenge is now to link redshifts
to distances

4
00:00:20,369 --> 00:00:25,160
because they can be calculated or predicted
by comological models.

5
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,920
If we can measure distances,
we can test cosmological models

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,940
by confronting the predictions of the models
to the observations

7
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:39,300
and by looking at models which are best capable
to predict the measured distances.

8
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:41,960
We will see in this video
how to measure the distances

9
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,929
and what the signification of these distances
are.

10
00:00:44,929 --> 00:00:48,269
We will see that there are essentially 2 available
methods for this :

11
00:00:48,269 --> 00:00:54,690
one is founded on what we call standard rulers
and the other on standard candles.

12
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:57,979
In the case of the standard ruler,
the principle is to measure how the angular

13
00:00:57,979 --> 00:01:01,729
size of an object
varies with the red shift.

14
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,700
If also know the physical size of this standard
object,

15
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,030
we know its distance.
It's what is drawn here

16
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:13,030
where we see a galaxy with an intrinsic size
and an apparent size.

17
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,670
The intrinsic size will not change with the
distance,

18
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:18,430
but the measured size, the angular size of
the sky

19
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:22,080
will change and it's like this that we will
be able to measure the distance.

20
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,071
We can hold the same logic
and measure the apparent luminosity of an

21
00:01:26,071 --> 00:01:30,480
object of which we would know also
the intrinsic luminosity, i.e., the absolute

22
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:34,350
magnitude.
It's what is shown here: a standard candle

23
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:38,530
with a well defined intrinsic luminosity
whose apparent luminosity will diminish with

24
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:44,670
the red shift and the distance.
It's thanks to these standard rulers and standard

25
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,730
candles
that we can link the red shifts

26
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:54,300
to the distances and make cosmological measurements.
What are we searching for in cosmology ?

27
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:58,570
We are trying to establish a connection
between redshifts

28
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:05,210
and the time that passes after the Big Bang.
So the time after the Big Bang is summarized

29
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:13,540
in this slide :
we have here the time beginning at time "zero".

30
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:17,739
The beginning of time is the Big Bang, which
is around here.

31
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:22,540
and then time passes after the Big Bang :
we arrive here for example at a red-shift

32
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:26,189
of 4
which corresponds to 1,5 billion years after

33
00:02:26,189 --> 00:02:28,829
the Big Bang.
So time flows in this direction.

34
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:35,139
At present time, we are around 13,8 billion
years

35
00:02:35,139 --> 00:02:39,340
and we will try to establish a connection
between the redshift

36
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:45,060
and time after the Big Bang, so the distance.
To do that, we need more and more powerful

37
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,010
observatories
So here we have the evolution in time of different

38
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:51,650
observatories.
Here's the Mount Palomar observatory with

39
00:02:51,650 --> 00:02:55,450
a 5m telescope in diameter
which allowed to reach redshifts of the order

40
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:58,269
of 1
with cameras that had the sensitivity of the

41
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:02,620
90s.
Then from space with more and more sensitive

42
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,489
cameras,
as more and more servicing missions to the

43
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:08,769
space telescope allowed
to replace the cameras that were used with

44
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:14,840
the telescope.
We were able to go to ever greater distances.

45
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,639
Here, we see that we added the infra red.
Why?

46
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:22,569
Simply because the spectrum of the galaxies
we try to observe,

47
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:26,610
will be more and more red shifted
to the point of reaching the infra red domain.

48
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,549
We therefore need infra red detectors
if we want to observe at extremely large distances.

49
00:03:32,549 --> 00:03:37,239
That is the actual space telescope
with optical and infra-red detectors.

50
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,230
and then there is the next generation space
telescope, the James Webb space telescope,

51
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:47,529
which will have only infra-red detectors.
It will be able to see extremely distant galaxies.

52
00:03:47,529 --> 00:03:52,159
The diameter of the James Webb telescope is
also much bigger,

53
00:03:52,159 --> 00:04:00,550
three times the actual space telescope diameter
which has a diameter of 2,4 meters.

54
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:06,449
What we try to do in observational cosmology,
is to use the fondamental relation

55
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:15,099
we established in the previous video.
between the redshift z or actually 1+z

56
00:04:15,099 --> 00:04:23,720
and the expansion factor of the universe α(t)
and what we can measure: the cosmological

57
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,780
red shift
measured by Doppler effect.

58
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:31,470
That is the wavelength of an object as we
would observe it

59
00:04:31,470 --> 00:04:37,190
and that is the emission wavelength of a signal
in the object's frame of reference that emitted

60
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:41,820
the signal.
The cosmological models give us the possibility

61
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:45,310
to determine
the distance to the objects, which will be

62
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:51,840
a function
of the red shift or the expansion factor,

63
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:59,300
and the cosmological parameters.
These cosmological parameters will be essentially

64
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:04,500
H zero
but also the density of the different components

65
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,240
of the universe.
These components will include the repulsive

66
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:17,230
dark energy
which is responsible for the accelerated expansion

67
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:22,290
of the universe
and dark matter.

68
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:27,770
Now how to define the distances ?
I said that we have standard rulers and standard

69
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:30,760
candles.
For standard rulers, we will suppose that

70
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:39,340
we have an object
of which we know the intrinsic radius

71
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,560
and then we observe this object at a given
distance d from us

72
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:50,440
and this object will underlie a solid angle,
the object has a given radius, which underlies

73
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:56,910
a certain solid angle ω
it is at a given distances from us, and that

74
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,770
is of interest
and we will have a relation between these

75
00:05:59,770 --> 00:06:02,400
three quantities.
It's simply the relation

76
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,070
between the solid angle and the radius of
the object :

77
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:11,390
ω (the solid angle) will be equal to πR²
(R is the radius of the star)

78
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,120
and D is the distance that we are interested
in.

79
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:19,690
So by measuring the solid angle,
if we know the intrinsic radius of the object,

80
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:24,460
we get the distance we will call the angular
diameter distance,

81
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:36,220
DA(z) will be equal to the square root of
πR² over w (w is an angle).

82
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:46,060
This is what we call angular diameter distance.
We also said that we have standard candles.

83
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,050
If we look at what happens at the level of
the standard candles,

84
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:55,130
how we will define the distance?
If we have a standard candle,

85
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,500
we do not have anymore a stellar object with
a well known,

86
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:02,470
well callibrated, well determined radius
but we have a certain luminosity which will

87
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:06,030
be the standard luminosity.
We have already seen how to measure the flux

88
00:07:06,030 --> 00:07:11,560
of an object
with a certain well known luminosity L

89
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:19,720
the object has an isotropic radiation at a
certain distance D from itself

90
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:24,460
and sends us a flux diluted over a sphere
like this

91
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:29,370
and the flux is simply
F is equal to L / (4πD²)

92
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:37,010
This allows us to define a second distance.
If we measure the flux of an object,

93
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,140
we know its intrinsic luminosity.
We deduce from it the distance we call the

94
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:45,300
luminosity distance
which depends on z (red shift)

95
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:51,580
measured by the Doppler effect,
so we will have D equal to L over 4π times

96
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:59,250
the measured flux.
This is what we call the luminosity distance.

97
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,680
So we have two possible definitions of the
distance,

98
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:09,100
one based on standard rulers,
and the other on standard candles.

99
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:15,250
So objects that have either a well known size
or a well known luminosity.

100
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:19,889
It's like this that we will define distances.
So let's see how the models

101
00:08:19,889 --> 00:08:25,590
(we use a given cosmological model
without giving the details of this model),

102
00:08:25,590 --> 00:08:32,260
here the curves that link the redshifts
to the distances in this case luminosity distances

103
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:39,640
and in this case angular diameter distances.
We have two types of distances.

104
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:45,250
In the case of luminosity distances
we have DL(z) equal to the square root of

105
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:53,090
L over 4πF
If we know an object of luminosity L

106
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,290
and place it a different redshifts,
we will measure a given flux

107
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:02,010
and deduce a given distance.
This is the predicted distance by a certain

108
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:05,650
cosmological model.
We have the angular diameter distance on one

109
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:11,620
side,
which will be equal to πR², so the intrinsic

110
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:17,770
radius,
which we are supposed to get by an independent

111
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:26,650
method,
and the solid angle which underlays the object.

112
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:30,560
We see that we do not have the same relations,
we do not have the same curves.

113
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,710
We have in fact a relation between the different
distances,

114
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:46,270
we have DL(z) = (1 + z) ² times DA(z)
it's for this that the curves are different.

115
00:09:46,270 --> 00:09:51,090
They are different but not incompatible .
We just have two ways of defining distances.

116
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,480
It's important to define how we look at distances
:

117
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:59,120
either with angular diameter distances,
or with luminosity distances.

118
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:03,520
In both case, we have to confront the correct
observations,

119
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,610
to the correct theoretical predictions.
Here we have models that predict luminosities

120
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:10,880
or apparent fluxes.
Here we have models that predict apparent

121
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:18,380
solid angles
for reference objects.

122
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,930
It's important to know what distance we are
talking about.

123
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,440
There is also something that might seem counterintuitive
:

124
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,750
in the case of luminosity distances, an objects
gets fainter and fainter

125
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:36,730
as the red shift gets higher.
Here when the red shift goes up, the angular

126
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:42,089
diameter distance to an object
will get to a peak and then go down.

127
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:46,339
This means in practice: ω the apparent diameter
or apparent radius

128
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:50,440
of an object in the sky, when its red shift
gets higher

129
00:10:50,440 --> 00:11:00,050
the apparent diameter will first go down
ω goes down, and then goes up in this part

130
00:11:00,050 --> 00:11:06,900
here of the curve .
An object that we will put further and further

131
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,330
will have the tendency of getting bigger and
bigger in appearance.

132
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:14,810
However, its apparent luminosity will continue
to diminish.

133
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:19,910
and the distances are linked by this equation
here.

134
00:11:19,910 --> 00:11:23,220
Now we will concentrate on the standard candle
methods

135
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:27,630
to measure distances.
We will link the velocity to the distances,

136
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:36,170
with Hubble's law,
valid for small shifts up, small z

137
00:11:36,170 --> 00:11:42,380
or in other words we will try to link the
distances to a function

138
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:49,220
of cosmology (z) and cosmological parameters.
Here z is measured by Doppler effect.

139
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:53,380
Cosmology are the parameters of a model
and when we change these parameters, we change

140
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:56,960
the prediction of these models.
D is what we try to measure with standard

141
00:11:56,960 --> 00:12:00,940
candles.
We have a very useful tool for that: the distance

142
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:06,850
module μ
the difference between the apparent magnitude

143
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:12,800
and the absolute magnitude of an object
which is equal to 5 times the log to the distance/sec

144
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:19,120
minus 5
So the method is very simple from here on:

145
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:27,770
if M is known, (for a standard candle)
and if m is measured, then we can deduce the

146
00:12:27,770 --> 00:12:37,720
distance.
The standard candle method is extremely simple

147
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,740
:
we use the distance modulus

148
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:43,880
we measure it by measuring the apparent magnitude
of a celestial body

149
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,610
of which we know also the absolute magnitude
and we get the distance.

150
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:51,080
There are a series of objects which we can
consider

151
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:56,940
as standard chandles.
The most famous are the cepheides stars

152
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,420
and we will also see the supernovae.
First the Cepheid stars :

153
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:07,050
are gigantic stars that are extremely bright,
so we can them from far away and they will

154
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:15,450
be pulsating.
If they pulsate, their radius varies periodically.

155
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:23,820
We have the famous relation L = 4πR²σT4
If the radius varies, the temperature also

156
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,200
varies a little bit
but it's the luminosity in the end that will

157
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:33,450
vary.
There is a relation between the period and

158
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:37,410
the luminosity
of the Cepheid stars.

159
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:42,760
If I show you this on a graph :
here is what could be the absolute magnitude

160
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:50,320
of a Cepheid star,
the time is here,

161
00:13:50,320 --> 00:14:00,370
and the light curve of the Cepheid star.
We have a given mean value,

162
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:03,800
we have a mean m,
we also have a period

163
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:13,100
and the Cepheid stars also have a link
between their absolute average magnitude and

164
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:16,529
the period.
So we have an average m which is equal to

165
00:14:16,529 --> 00:14:25,670
a function of the period.
Also the luminosity grows with P

166
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:31,550
So M decreases with P because it's in magnitude
and the exact relation is m average in the

167
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:36,820
v band
is equal to minus 2,43 times (the decimal

168
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:48,250
logarithm of the period - 1) minus 4,05
This means that if we measure for example

169
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:52,790
observational points,
on a curve like this.

170
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:56,330
I take a galaxy in which there is a Cepheid
star,

171
00:14:56,330 --> 00:15:01,170
I regularly measure its photometry
and then I will have what I call the light

172
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:04,360
curve.
I will be able to measure the period and so

173
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:08,090
have the absolute magnitude
that I will be able to inject in the distance

174
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,520
module.
Here is again the formula of the distance

175
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,040
modulus:
we will be able to inject m average here in

176
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:19,050
the formula of the distance modulus
and get the distance.

177
00:15:19,050 --> 00:15:27,250
It's a relation that was first measured
by Henrietta Leavitt, in the years 1910-1920.

178
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:35,790
It's not something recent but it's only recently
that we could apply this method with the Hubble

179
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,810
space telescope
to measure distances to galaxies

180
00:15:40,810 --> 00:15:47,050
to around 40 - 50 megaparsec from us.
There are some very well known stars that

181
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:50,580
are Cepheid stars :
obviously the δ Cephei star which is the

182
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:58,380
archetype of Cepheid stars
but the polar star is also a Cepheid star

183
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:02,730
The star towards which the rotation axis of
the earth points, the polar star,

184
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:12,269
is a pulsating Cepheid star.
As I said before, we used the space telescope

185
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:16,400
to observe the Cepheid stars.
We also need to separate the stars in the

186
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:22,470
Messier 31 galaxy in this case here,
to distinguish between the Cepheids and other

187
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,140
stars.
I said that Cepheid are very bright, here

188
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:27,930
is one
If we measure the luminous flux of that Cepheid

189
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:30,920
star in time,
we see that from here to here the star has

190
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:33,930
grown in brightness.
We measure the light curve, we measure the

191
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:36,730
period,
and we deduce the absolute magnitude.

192
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:48,360
For the Andromeda galaxy, the measured distance
is 778 +/- 17 kg/sec

193
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:52,370
and the recession velocity measured by Doppler
effect

194
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:59,880
is around 301 +/- 7 km/s,
so the Andromeda galaxy flees from us at an

195
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:05,299
approximate velocity of 300 km per second.
We know other standard candles which will

196
00:17:05,299 --> 00:17:09,100
be
even brighter, so we will see them from even

197
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:12,929
further away :
which will be type 1a supernovae

198
00:17:12,929 --> 00:17:16,210
I'll skip the details here on how supernovae
work.

199
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:19,610
They are two types. Type 1 supernovae stars
:

200
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:32,720
those are white dwarfs which are in orbit
around a common gravity centre with giant

201
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:38,410
or super giant stars.
Matter will go from the giant to the white

202
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:41,610
dwarf
and matter will accrete.

203
00:17:41,610 --> 00:17:44,400
After some time, we will have a sufficient
critical mass

204
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,360
for a supernova explosion.
This is a type of supernova i haven't talked

205
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,220
about
in the previous videos.

206
00:17:51,220 --> 00:18:01,490
What we had until now, were type 2 supernovae
which we call core-collapse supernovae.

207
00:18:01,490 --> 00:18:07,140
We have seen that for massive stars
we have nuclear reactions up to the iron fusion

208
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:10,280
reaction
which takes place from here on,

209
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:14,250
the iron reaction being endothermic the core
of the star collapses

210
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:20,390
and we have a supernova explosion.
This is what we saw in the previous chapter.

211
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:25,030
chapter 5 on stellar evolution.
The supernovae of interest for us are type

212
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:30,250
1 a supernovae,
which are fact white dwarfs, so binary stars,

213
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:37,880
white dwarfs,
around a giant

214
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:43,110
and matter will fall, attracted by the white
dwarf,

215
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:48,429
spiral around the white dwarf
and so accrete matter

216
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:51,140
After some time,
we will reach the critical mass of the white

217
00:18:51,140 --> 00:19:02,400
dwarf,
the critical mass is 1,44 Solar Mass

218
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:09,280
also called the Chandrasekhar mass.
Each time the white dwarf has accreted enough

219
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:14,280
matter,
that is 1,44 times the mass of the sun,

220
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:23,450
we will have a supernova detonation.
Since the critical mass is always the same

221
00:19:23,450 --> 00:19:29,710
we will always have the same luminosity.
Actually it's the explosion peak that will

222
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:34,620
always have the same luminosity.
What is of interests here is what we call

223
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:39,490
the light curve of the supernova as in the
Cepheid stars case.

224
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,020
But this time on the axes we have the time
here

225
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:47,260
the luminosity here, and also the absolute
magnitude that would be here.

226
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:51,780
When the supernova explodes, it will grow
in luminosity,

227
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:57,420
reach a peak and then go down.
If we calibrate this curve, we will see that

228
00:19:57,420 --> 00:20:08,890
at a given moment,
we have a luminosity peak that

229
00:20:08,890 --> 00:20:14,700
will correspond to an absolute magnitude in
the v band of -19,3

230
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:19,770
So when a supernova explodes, we take some
measurement points,

231
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:25,900
we have a light curve,
we make the adjustment by least square over

232
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,680
the light curve,
we measure the peak and that gives us the

233
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:33,110
absolute magnitude in the v band
another time, that is what we will inject

234
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:37,040
in the distance modulus
to determine the distance to the supernova.

235
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:42,380
Here are some supernovae examples :
here we have a spiral galaxy at a relatively

236
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:46,370
short distance.
We have here the distance C measured through

237
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:57,049
supernovae
of 15,5 +/- 0,6 megaparsec

238
00:20:57,049 --> 00:21:00,050
that is already a lot further away than the
Andromeda galaxy.

239
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:03,160
We would not be able to see Cepheids in a
galaxy like this.

240
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:06,650
The recession velocity here is much larger
: 602

241
00:21:06,650 --> 00:21:12,770
so exactly twice that of Andromeda
so 602 km per second

242
00:21:12,770 --> 00:21:20,600
and if we take a spectrum of that supernova
we will find that there is no hydrogen line.

243
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:30,120
Instead we will have silicium II, i.e., silicium
ionized once,

244
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:36,100
that can be found at the wavelength 6150 Å
It's these two caracteristics

245
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:40,620
that are the spectral signatures of type 1a
supernovae.

246
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:43,150
When a supernova explodes, we can do two things
:

247
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,650
we take a spectrum, we look if there is no
hydrogen

248
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:48,580
and if there is silicium
and we measure the light curve to get the

249
00:21:48,580 --> 00:21:54,530
apparent magnitude
of the supernova, which will worrespond to

250
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:58,780
a given absolute magnitude.
So we will have the distance modulus

251
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:02,429
and the distance to the galaxy where the supernova
is.

252
00:22:02,429 --> 00:22:09,400
Here is another galaxy NGC 3370
The distance is beginning to be a bit higher

253
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,790
:
we have a distance of around 30 megaparsec

254
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:16,980
We have here an observation taken by a ground
telescope,

255
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:20,580
with a supernova that exploded,
and an observation taken with the spatial

256
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,480
telescope
with the supernova before or after the explosion

257
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:29,850
in any case not present on the image.
The recession velocity of this galaxy is even

258
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:35,549
higher than the others :
1279 km per second for this one

259
00:22:35,549 --> 00:22:42,220
Now if we go even further,
we'll be able to see the true usefulness of

260
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,460
the supernovae tool
We have galaxies at a red shift of around

261
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,990
1,
the red shift is around 1

262
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:54,300
and we have different supernovae here :
we see an extremely bright one here.

263
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,750
In fact many times brighter than the galaxy
in which the supernova is, which we barely

264
00:22:58,750 --> 00:23:01,919
see.
We have another here which is in an interacting

265
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:06,000
galaxy.
Another one here, with a relatively blue supernova

266
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:12,200
spectrum.
And here another one.

267
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,660
So thanks to these supernovae
we will be able to measure the distances to

268
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:20,059
all these galaxies.
The further we go, the better we will test

269
00:23:20,059 --> 00:23:24,210
the cosmological models.
What will be important here, thanks to the

270
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:29,050
Cepheids or supernovae,
is to construct what is called a Hubble diagram.

271
00:23:29,050 --> 00:23:33,799
This Hubble diagram links the distance modulus
to the red shift.

272
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:37,250
Here is how one of these diagrams looks like
:

273
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:44,070
these are not observations or predictions.
It's just a qualitative schematic.

274
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:52,299
We will have here a red shift.
Here the distance module m minus M

275
00:23:52,299 --> 00:23:57,630
So for the Cepheids, we measure the mean apparent
magnitude

276
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:01,820
and we know, thanks to the period-luminosity
relation,

277
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:06,000
the absolute magnitude.
For a supernova, we know the absolute magnitude

278
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:10,490
of the luminosity peak at the explosion.
We measure the apparent magnitude of the explosion

279
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:15,610
peak
and obtain the distance modulus.

280
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:22,860
Now we of course have theoretical predictions.
I draw like this,

281
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:28,980
theoretical models which link the red shift
to the distance modulus.

282
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:36,470
Then, we have to take sufficiently precise
observational points

283
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:40,090
to be able to discriminate between the different
cosmological models.

284
00:24:40,090 --> 00:24:45,250
We can already see here that the further one
goes in red shift,

285
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:48,320
the more one will be able to discriminate
between the different models.

286
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:54,770
If I take points too close to us
we will not be able to discriminate between

287
00:24:54,770 --> 00:24:57,600
the cosmological models,
while there we can do it.

288
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,070
Of course it is harder to measure distant
points

289
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:06,150
since we need bigger telescopes
but we also test the cosmology better.

290
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:10,419
The prediction of the models, the difference
between the curves,

291
00:25:10,419 --> 00:25:17,600
will be the cosmological parameters so H zero
but also the different energy density parameters.

292
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:28,480
70% dark energy, 25% dark matter
and 5% baryonic matter or normal matter.

293
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:37,270
So the difference between these models here,
are the proportions of these different densities.

294
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:42,650
If we manage to measure μ and z,
we can differentiate between the different

295
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:46,190
cosmological models.
Since the years 2000, we know that we live

296
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:49,380
in an universe
in accelerated expansion, so we were able

297
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:53,390
to discriminate between the different curves
in these Hubble diagrams.

298
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:57,789
A word about what we call the distance scale
:

299
00:25:57,789 --> 00:26:03,390
we have seen that we have different methods
to measure distances.

300
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:10,620
The goal is to go to high red shifts.
We have high red shifts, large distances here

301
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:16,160
We are somewhere in the Milky Way.
Then we can measure parallaxes in the Milky

302
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:22,220
Way.
We will be able to go to distances of around

303
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:30,850
40-50 megaparsec.
We will be able to use Cepheids.

304
00:26:30,850 --> 00:26:40,040
and then further, we will use supernovae
We have a certain number of inter calibration

305
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:44,750
zones, let's say :
for example here a zone where we have measured

306
00:26:44,750 --> 00:26:51,500
parallaxes
for Cepheid stars.

307
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:54,660
So we will be able to establish a period liuminosity
relation

308
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:59,000
for Cepheids by measuring their distances
with parallaxes.

309
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:07,179
Then we have a zone here where we have galaxies
in which we have Cepheids.

310
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:13,340
From time to time these galaxies will have
a type 1a supernova

311
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:20,660
These are very rare, each galaxy has around
one type 1a supernova per century.

312
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:24,960
So these objects are extremely rare,
we know of approximately 10 at the present

313
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:27,660
time.
It's thanks to this that will be able to correctly

314
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:31,350
calibrate the relation
between the supernova luminosity at their

315
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:39,840
peak
and the distance.

316
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,950
Further away we use only supernovae
as distance indicators.

317
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:48,610
We have three essential indicators :
parallaxes, Cepheids, supernovae

318
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:53,200
which will be calibrated between each other
in some zones where we have two different

319
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,100
indicators available at the same time
and then at a larger red shift,

320
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:03,170
we only have access to extremely bright supernovae
allowing us to go very far in our distance

321
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,900
measurements.
We have seen how crucial,

322
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,250
it is important to measure distances in the
universe.

323
00:28:09,250 --> 00:28:11,710
it's one of the rare methods in fact the only
one

324
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:15,850
we have at our disposition
to test the cosmological parameters,

325
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,321
the parameters of the models
which describe the relation between red shift

326
00:28:20,321 --> 00:28:23,140
on the one hand,
measured by the Doppler effect,

327
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:28,250
and the distance on the other hand,
so what we predict through cosmological models.

328
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:33,670
there are a given number of obstacles to this
but fortunately they are not insurmountable.

329
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:37,409
What we need in practice
are bigger and bigger telescopes

330
00:28:37,409 --> 00:28:44,100
to capture as much light as possible
and so see further and further standard candles,

331
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,770
standard candles which will send us less and
less photons

332
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:52,900
due to their distance.
That is not all, we also need ultra fine images,

333
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:56,630
at very high resolution,
as shown here, a galaxy taken with the Hubble

334
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:01,059
space telescope.
In these images, we will be able

335
00:29:01,059 --> 00:29:05,620
by zooming, to isolate interesting objects
from the surrounding objects.

336
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:09,840
For example we will be able to see
the image of standard Cepheid candles

337
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:15,860
a crowded stellar neighbourhood.
In this sense, the Hubble space telescope

338
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,549
is
absolutely crucial for cosmology.
