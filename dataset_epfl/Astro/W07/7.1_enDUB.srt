1
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:09,719
Up to now,
we have seen how are formed

2
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,230
celestial bodies that compose the universe,
how they evolve

3
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:17,450
and what are the physical phenomenons
which give them their mass and luminosity.

4
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:22,689
But what for the Universe as a whole ?
What is its origin? How does it evolve with

5
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,759
time?
What will become of it ? What is his global

6
00:00:24,759 --> 00:00:28,180
composition ?
All these question are closely linked, and

7
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,850
belong to the field of cosmology.
The theory which currently best explains

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:38,390
all observations that are at our disposal
is the Big Bang theory, where the Universe

9
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:42,920
was born of one initial explosion,
some 13, 8 billion years ago,

10
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,399
followed by an extremely rapid expansion,
called inflation,

11
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,429
then, a slower expansion, as was found in
twenties-thirties.

12
00:00:49,429 --> 00:00:55,640
Since the years 2000,
we know that this expansion is accelerated,

13
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,850
but the reason for this remains completely
unknown.

14
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:04,100
This can be explained only by invoking the
existence of a repulsive force,

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:07,210
due to some unknown form of energy called
dark energy,

16
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,050
and that would counteract the gravitational
force,

17
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:14,530
which tends to make the Universe contract
itself.

18
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:18,840
So we said that the Universe is expanding,
that doesn't mean that the Universe was born

19
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:21,930
in one point
and is expanding like a spherical ball.

20
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:25,000
But it means that all points are growing further
apart from each other

21
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,570
with some factor, called the expansion factor.
So for example, here,

22
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:33,560
we have a certain distance which becomes longer
as the Universe is growing.

23
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:38,850
We have another distance here,
which also becomes longer by a certain factor,

24
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:45,290
etc, etc.
and the same for the distance here.

25
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:50,660
and if we call r' the distance here and r
the distance here between two points,

26
00:01:50,660 --> 00:02:01,890
we have r' = a * r,
where a is what we call the expansion factor.

27
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:08,390
So lets look at this expansion in more details.
So here we have a grid representing the metric

28
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:11,280
defining how we measure coordinates in the
Universe .

29
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,980
and this grid will evolve with time,
so time flows like this.

30
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:21,439
and we can localize objects on this grid in
various ways.

31
00:02:21,439 --> 00:02:29,409
For example, we put an origin here
so the origin will be here,

32
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:36,510
at an instant t later
We take an object at a coordinate X.

33
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:41,270
And when we let the system evolve with time,
the X coordinate hasn't changed,

34
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:45,459
for example, we take a section here and a
section there to go to X.

35
00:02:45,459 --> 00:02:49,389
And we take a section here, a section there,
to go to X.

36
00:02:49,389 --> 00:02:58,120
So X is what we call the comobile coordinate,
which moves with the reference grid.

37
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,670
We can also localise objects in a different
way.

38
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:07,939
We can say that the distance from O and X
is the distance r, which is here.

39
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:14,379
so r(t).
and then, a moment later, the distance r(t)

40
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:19,450
has grown.
so this r(t) will be equal

41
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:24,290
to a certain expansion factor times the co-mobile
coordinate.

42
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:30,959
So a(t) is the expansion factor of the Universe.
Now we will see how all this evolves.

43
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:38,209
So, as we said, r(t) is equal to a(t) times
X.

44
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:44,579
Of course we can also write
that X = r(t) / a(t).

45
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:48,939
Then, if we derive the expression to get the
velocity,

46
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:55,409
we will try here to recover Hubble's law.
We will have here da/dt times X because X

47
00:03:55,409 --> 00:03:59,329
doesn't change with time.
So if we input X here, we will have,

48
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:07,419
that r', that is V(r, t),
will be equal to a'(t)/a(t),

49
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:13,680
I just introduced X here,
times r(t).

50
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,950
And what we will do here, we will write that
this,

51
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:25,280
is H(t), and this is the expansion rate of
the Universe.

52
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:29,930
So we had an expansion factor,
a(t), while this is a ratio a'/a,

53
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:33,020
that is an expansion rate. So now,
we can also write

54
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:42,919
that V(r0, t0),
is equal to H(t0) times r(t0).

55
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,440
In other words,
we have here Hubble's law.

56
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:57,530
Namely, V = H0 times r,
that is to say, times the distance that separates

57
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:00,889
us from an object.
So what we wrote here, is nothing other than

58
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:08,920
Hubble's law.
Then, this Hubble expansion law,

59
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,780
we will write it again here:
V = H0 times D.

60
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:18,139
That was Hubble in 1929.
But actually, the idea was also proposed by

61
00:05:18,139 --> 00:05:24,580
Georges Lemaître,
a belgian astrophysicist, in 1927.

62
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:32,430
Drawing this law, as we have already seen,
it connects the distance, long distances indeed,

63
00:05:32,430 --> 00:05:37,250
measured in mega parsecs (Mpc),
to the velocity, also large velocities,

64
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:42,159
measured in km per second (km/s).
That is what we call the recession velocity

65
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:44,159
of galaxies.
And we have a linear law

66
00:05:44,159 --> 00:05:52,360
between velocity and distance.
and what H0 measures, is the slope of this

67
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:59,310
line.
The present value of H0 isn't very well known.

68
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,479
To date there is a 10% error margin on the
exact value,

69
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,289
perhaps a bit better in the more optimistic
cases.

70
00:06:06,289 --> 00:06:14,320
it amounts to 70 km/s per Mpc.
Right, these units may seem strange but they

71
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:17,740
are indeed km/s
per Mpc that are measured.

72
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:22,539
Now, the units can be simplified.
The true dimension of H0, is in fact the inverse

73
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:30,560
of a time.
Thus, 1/H0 belongs of course to the time dimension.

74
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:33,050
and is actually the age of the Universe.
So why?

75
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:36,270
Becase if we know the distance and the velocity
of a point,

76
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:41,720
we can find the time needed
for that point to be in contact with us.

77
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:47,009
So, we have an expanding universe,
all points were in contact at the beginning,

78
00:06:47,009 --> 00:06:55,230
at the Big Bang.
and 1 / H0 later, 13,8 billion years later,

79
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,169
the Universe has its present shape, its present
size.

80
00:06:59,169 --> 00:07:02,370
So we have an expanding universe; now, what
is the link with

81
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,699
what is called the redshift, the cosmological
red shift?

82
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:10,159
We can write the Doppler effect,
namely the ratio dλ / λ.

83
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:14,250
This is λ observed minus λ emitted divided
by λ emitted,

84
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:20,740
which is equal to dv/c,
that is

85
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:25,710
the Doppler effect,
that we had seen in Chapter 3.2.

86
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:32,120
Now we have seen that following Hubble's law,
that V equals H times distance,

87
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,150
so here, we have a differential
hence we also have a differential there.

88
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:44,469
We have the constant c which stays here.
H, as we said, is a'/a,

89
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:49,800
and we have dr / c which stays here.
Now a certain time dt is needed to travel

90
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:55,380
the distance dr with the velocity c.
So we could write that as:

91
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:00,930
(a'/a)*dt.
Now, what does this mean?

92
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:07,510
Re-arranging these two terms here,
it means that dλ / λ is equal...

93
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:12,610
remembering that a' is da/dt,
and then we have dt/a left.

94
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:19,199
So in the end, we obtain dλ /λ = da/a.
This is a differential equation

95
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,330
of the first order.
The solution to this,

96
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:26,319
is λ(a) equals a certain constant K
times a.

97
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:33,300
Thus, at the present epoch,
we have a = 1,

98
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:40,810
so we have that λ_emitted (1)
is equal to λ_observed.

99
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:45,670
Because at present, the wavelength,
with an expansion factor of 1,

100
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:48,610
the emission and observation wavelengths are
the same.

101
00:08:48,610 --> 00:08:52,920
So we have a = 1 here,
and this implies that the constant K is equal

102
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,260
to λ_observed.
This is simply the Doppler effect.

103
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,750
For a universe with an expansion factor of
1.

104
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:13,600
Now, if we re-arrange the results here,
what we will get is that λ obs / λ emit

105
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,380
is equal to 1/a.
It is exactly this equation

106
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:24,060
once we have replaced the K constant by λ_obs.
We also have the Doppler effect formula,

107
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:31,260
telling us that (λ_obs minus λ_emit) / λ_emit
is equal to V/c, as we have seen,

108
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:34,800
and we will set this as being equal to z.
and this will be,

109
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:42,780
by definition, the famous red shift.
Now, if we gather these two equations,

110
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:48,139
we see that we will have :
λ_obs / λ_emit

111
00:09:48,139 --> 00:09:52,750
= 1/a,
namely the inverse of the expansion factor.

112
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,079
But it is also equal to 1 + z.
This implies that, if we want to know

113
00:09:57,079 --> 00:10:03,079
the red shift of an object,
we measure a given observed wavelength.

114
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:10,220
let's take for example a line in a spectrum:
if we know its wavelength at rest,

115
00:10:10,220 --> 00:10:13,920
in other words the emission wavelength, the
intrinsic wavelength of the line,

116
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,310
then we can find the redshift z.
That is the well known equation

117
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:28,000
of the cosmological Doppler effect.
Now an example.

118
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,600
Lets take the Hubble Deep Field, as we did
several times before in this class.

119
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,380
We see that there are many galaxies of all
colours.

120
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:41,350
Some are blue, others are rather green,
yet others are red, like here, and there are

121
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:45,130
two reason for that.
First of all, galaxies have intrinsic colours.

122
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:50,459
Some have blue and hot stars, just born.
Such galaxies have an intrinsic blue colour.

123
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:53,750
Others will have for example a lot of dust
making their colour redder,

124
00:10:53,750 --> 00:10:56,860
or contain a population of old stars,
with low masses.

125
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:00,600
So there are multiple reasons
for the observed colours of galaxies.

126
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,709
But one additional reason is the cosmological
red shift.

127
00:11:03,709 --> 00:11:07,860
For that we can draw
the spectrum of a galaxy

128
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:14,240
in a schematic way.
So a galaxy spectrum resembles this.

129
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:18,930
There are stars in a galaxy,
so we will have the Break

130
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:23,630
at 4 000 angströms, Balmer's Break,
that we had already seen in the chapter dedicated

131
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,420
to hydrogen.
So here, we have a typical feature

132
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:30,089
at 4 000 angströms,
if the galaxy is at rest,

133
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:35,339
without any cosmological red shift.
Now this is the wavelength,

134
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:44,190
of λ_emission when at rest.
And λ_observed will be equal to (1 + z)

135
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:47,210
times λ_emitted.
So, if we have an object with a very high

136
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,339
red shift,
5 for instance,

137
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:55,019
we will multiply 4000 by 5+1 or 6.
So we will have

138
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:57,940
wavelengths that will move like this, far
into the red.

139
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:02,250
I will put here again the wavelength, and
there the flux, since we have a spectrum,

140
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,820
so we will multiply the whole spectrum
by that factor (1 + z).

141
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:12,100
So we will find here again the break,
that was seen before at rest, but now (1 +

142
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:15,440
z) times farther.
and the spectrum will be stretched by a factor

143
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,850
(1 + z).
So everything is stretched by a factor (1

144
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,870
+ z) in cosmology.
So now, if I add filters

145
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,250
to this,
for example

146
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:31,339
a filter here,
and a filter there,

147
00:12:31,339 --> 00:12:36,190
and one here, and then I integrate the light
as we did before in the first chapters of

148
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,350
this course,
i will have a lot of flux here in an infrared

149
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:43,820
filter for example.
Here, considering the red filter,

150
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:50,730
I will have a moderate flux,
and then almost no flux at all in the blue.

151
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:56,610
Now if we make a true colour image of a galaxy,
with this spectral distribution,

152
00:12:56,610 --> 00:13:01,139
we will have typically, a galaxy,
as we can see here,

153
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:04,040
which will appear very red in a true colour
image.

154
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:09,190
Of course, all intermediate situations occur.
In images like these, you can find galaxies

155
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,449
with any colours.
First, because they have an intrinsic colour,

156
00:13:12,449 --> 00:13:15,509
and second,
because they have a certain cosmological red

157
00:13:15,509 --> 00:13:19,170
shift.
Remember, the universe is expanding.

158
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:23,000
and a simple way to determine whether it will
expand forever or not,

159
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:27,860
is to see whether the system is bound or not,
I mean the universe as a whole.

160
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:37,050
So, is the universe bound or not?
Is it a gravitationally bound system?

161
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,600
So we write the equilibrium
between the kinetic energy and the potential

162
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:43,190
energy.
Here M is the mass of the Universe.

163
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:46,589
R is its radius, or characteristic radius,
V the velocity

164
00:13:46,589 --> 00:13:50,670
of a test particle in the Universe.
This is 0, so it would be the total energy

165
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:56,970
of the Universe.
Now, we have seen that V is H_0 R,

166
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:03,269
namely H0 times a distance, squared here.
We move the 2 to the other side of the equation.

167
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:11,759
thus obtaining 2 G M / R.
and this, if we assume a constant density,

168
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:19,550
will equal 2 G / R times ρ
times 4/3 π R³.

169
00:14:19,550 --> 00:14:25,089
This allows us to define a density,
which can be defined as a critical density,

170
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:36,380
the value of which is 3/8 (H0²/Gπ).
So this ρ is what we call

171
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:41,182
the critical density of the Universe.
it is such that, if ρ is larger than ρ_critical,

172
00:14:41,182 --> 00:14:45,040
then the potential energy is larger then the
kinetic one

173
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,160
and we have a contraction, or at least
a fading expansion. And if ρ is smaller than

174
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:52,620
ρ_critical,
then we have an everlasting expansion.

175
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:59,050
So we can see that the density of the Universe
is of crucial and far-reaching importance

176
00:14:59,050 --> 00:15:03,579
regarding the future of the universe.
For that reason, it is extremly important

177
00:15:03,579 --> 00:15:07,319
to understand the energy balance, the different
density contributions,

178
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:12,519
of the different components of our universe.
Currently, the very fact

179
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:15,199
that the Universe is undergoing accelerated
expansion

180
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:20,290
implies, within the framework of the Big Bang
model,

181
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:27,569
that we have 68% of dark energy;
that is the energy balance of the Universe.

182
00:15:27,569 --> 00:15:31,160
This dark energy is repulsive,
and explains or mimics

183
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:40,240
a Universe undergoing accelerated expansion.
On the other hand we have 27% of dark matter,

184
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,899
which is subject to gravity,
and as such, tends to make the universe contract;

185
00:15:44,899 --> 00:15:49,220
and the proportions we have here result in
a universe in accelerated expansion.

186
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:55,040
And than, we have a very small fraction
of the total energy content, 5%,

187
00:15:55,040 --> 00:16:03,110
which is normal matter, called baryonic matter.
So this baryonic matter includes

188
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:06,290
the proton and neutrons, and by extension
the electrons

189
00:16:06,290 --> 00:16:09,600
that are not baryons but actually leptons,
but are associated

190
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,750
with normal matter, which is called normal,
or baryonic.

191
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:15,509
Some of this matter
Some of this matter

192
00:16:15,509 --> 00:16:20,130
which emits radiation,
is fact the subject of all this course,

193
00:16:20,130 --> 00:16:26,740
so "normal" matter,
but that doesn't emit light or light at

194
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:30,889
the wavelengths we can observe.
And there is also dark matter

195
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:35,170
that does not emit any light at all,
at any wavelength, we have no idea

196
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:37,940
of what it is.
So if we talk about dark matter,

197
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:41,139
it can be two things :
either dark matter, here of which we have

198
00:16:41,139 --> 00:16:44,579
absolutely no idea,
or normal baryonic matter but which we cannot

199
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:48,670
see
because either it doesn't emit enough light,

200
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:54,490
or it emits at wavelengths we do not observe.
So now, these 5 % of baryonic light,

201
00:16:54,490 --> 00:17:01,560
has a mass distribution as follows:
5 % of "normal" (baryonic) matter,

202
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,319
which are composed 80% of gas, only 20 % of
stars,

203
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:08,589
and 0.1 % of dust,
you remember these dark lines

204
00:17:08,589 --> 00:17:13,030
that absorb the light in galaxies,
and dark holes,

205
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:16,850
even if they are very compact objects,
they are very few of them,

206
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,789
and represent only 0.01% of the energy or
the mass.

207
00:17:21,789 --> 00:17:25,880
So these numbers
are taken from observations of the Cosmic

208
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:30,110
Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.
What's it is all about?

209
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,160
First of all
it's a black body radiation

210
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:46,700
whose temperature is 2,728 degrees K
and there are small spatial variations

211
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,390
of temperature of around 10 to the power -5.
Now if we take the mean temperature

212
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:56,150
over the whole sky we will find a perfect
black body,

213
00:17:56,150 --> 00:18:01,380
which is represented by this curve here,
measured by the COBE satellite,

214
00:18:01,380 --> 00:18:05,570
which stands for the « Cosmic Background
Explorer ».

215
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:08,700
Its an American satellite,
from NASA,

216
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,590
which has measured for the first time the
temperature of the cosmological background.

217
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:17,530
So the black body radiation is a radiation
at 2, 728 K.

218
00:18:17,530 --> 00:18:21,730
We measure the temperature of the sky background
everywhere, in all directions of the universe

219
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:27,179
isotropically,
equals to 2, 728 degrés K, with small variations

220
00:18:27,179 --> 00:18:30,520
of 10-5.
At the beginning, just after the Big Bang

221
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,690
the Universe had a much larger temperature
temperatures of course,

222
00:18:33,690 --> 00:18:36,510
that cooled down due to the expansion
and at the present time,

223
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:42,059
the temperature is 2,728 degrees K.
So, what is the history behind the discovery

224
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:44,380
of the cosmological background ?
First of all,

225
00:18:44,380 --> 00:18:47,140
come the first observations by Penzias and
Wilson,

226
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:54,570
who observed with a telecomunication antenna
at a wavelength of 1,063 mm,

227
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:59,310
so in the micro waves,
They observed in different directions on the

228
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:06,299
sky and each time,
observed a background noise corresponding

229
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:10,730
to a black body radiation at 2,728 degrees
K.

230
00:19:10,730 --> 00:19:13,910
So they observed with an antenna
that didn't permit them to construct a map

231
00:19:13,910 --> 00:19:16,280
of the sky,
but they observed that

232
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:19,500
wherever they did the measurement on the sky
background,

233
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:26,049
if they observed here, here or here or anywhere,
they were measuring 2, 728 degrees K.

234
00:19:26,049 --> 00:19:30,929
So these maps, that we see often
represented like this in an oval shape,

235
00:19:30,929 --> 00:19:35,000
they are in galactic coordinates.
So we have here ,

236
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:39,150
the galactic longitude and latitude
we already saw

237
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:45,700
in the chapter about the Oort constants.
We have the whole sky map here,

238
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:50,940
as seen by the antenna of Penzias and Wilson,
then seen by the COBE satellite.

239
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:58,159
Its the « Cosmic Background Explorer »,
which measured and obtained the first sky

240
00:19:58,159 --> 00:20:03,620
map in 1992.
What you see here is the millimeter image

241
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:07,169
of the Milky Way.
By improving the observations

242
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:14,299
with the « Wilkinson Microwave Background
Anisotropy Probe »,

243
00:20:14,299 --> 00:20:20,400
we can see more and more details in the map
of the cosmological background radiation.

244
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:26,780
There are still
around 30 years each observation.

245
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:30,620
So this cosmological background radiation
is not observed easily.

246
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:34,270
The observation of Penzias and Wilson,
is a constant over the whole of the sky.

247
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:37,110
but we have to take into account that the
Milky Way

248
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:40,730
is moving in the sky,
and so we go towards a point that can be found

249
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:46,000
here.
Of course, if we look in the direction opposite

250
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,630
to the movement,
we find ourselves here and so we see a "bluer"

251
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:53,510
sky, a bluer wavelength
in the direction of the motion, and redder

252
00:20:53,510 --> 00:20:57,120
in the opposite direction,
due to the Doppler effect, So what we see

253
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:01,610
here
is what we call the "cosmological dipole",

254
00:21:01,610 --> 00:21:04,890
because they are two poles like this.
and this is simply due to the movement of

255
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:07,850
the Milky Way,
with respect to the cosmological background

256
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:10,450
radiation.
Now the velocity of the Milky Way,

257
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,400
with respect to the cosmological background
radiation,

258
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:19,070
measured through the Doppler dipole,
is V = 627 ± 22 km/s.

259
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:27,809
Thanks to 
the Doppler effect,

260
00:21:27,809 --> 00:21:30,130
we have some sort of absolute referential
here,

261
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:32,750
that allows us to measure the proper motion
of the Milky Way

262
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:38,169
in the Universe.
So now if we substract this Doppler effect

263
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:44,559
we finally obtain
the map of the cosmological background radiation

264
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,710
with also here the image of the Milky Way.
The cosmological information is of course

265
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:52,020
hidden by the Milky Way.
But the Milky Way can be removed thanks to

266
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:55,330
multi frequency maps,
obtained here with the Planck satellite,

267
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:58,260
which is the last satellite to have taken
CMB measurements.

268
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,490
So this is recent, 2013-2014.
By taking multi frequency maps

269
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:06,309
of the sky
we can, thanks to the apparent change of the

270
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:11,870
Milky Way shape,
substract it to get the final image,

271
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:15,549
which is here.
So this is the map obtained by the Planck

272
00:22:15,549 --> 00:22:19,279
satellite,
it's a temperature map of course,

273
00:22:19,279 --> 00:22:23,160
the average of the temperatures is 2,728 degrees
K.

274
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:28,140
and there are small fluctuations around it.
So this red points here are slightly hotter

275
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,791
than this,
and the blue points slightly colder, with

276
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:34,280
variations
of temperature that are Δt/t, as we have

277
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:39,309
already said
around 10 to the power -5.

278
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:42,450
The cosmological information is contained
in fact,

279
00:22:42,450 --> 00:22:45,840
in the statistical distribution of these small
points and this

280
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:49,340
is what we want to measure very precisely
at small scales,

281
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:53,190
but also at large scales.
Because this is what the Big Bang theory predicts.

282
00:22:53,190 --> 00:22:57,340
So we will try to make observations
that we will confront to the theory.

283
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,160
Or in other words, we will confront the theory
to the observations.

284
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:05,360
So what is the cause of the fluctuations?
When the Universe was born it was extremely

285
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,419
hot,
then the temperature decreased and while the

286
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:17,929
Universe was younger
than 380 000 ans,

287
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:27,040
we had a hot Plasma.
So hot that photons and electrons were seperated.

288
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:30,900
The gas was totally ionized
So now the photons

289
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:35,730
present in the gas at that time,
were constantly in interaction with the electrons,

290
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,810
they were in fact
all the time scattered by electrons,

291
00:23:38,810 --> 00:23:43,580
until the moment where, due to the decreasing
temperature of the Universe,

292
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:48,040
because of the expansion,
so when t dimishes, this intervenes

293
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:56,700
at a time t = 380 000 years
after the Big Bang

294
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,309
So a that moment, we have
what the recombination between protons and

295
00:24:00,309 --> 00:24:05,380
electrons.
So now, if protons and electrons recombine,

296
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:09,270
this produces hydrogen, with the consequence
that photons cannot anymore

297
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:15,210
be scattered by electrons.
So photons propagate straight through a Universe

298
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:19,760
that is completely transparent to light and
reach us.

299
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:25,070
So what we see here is what we call
the surface of last diffusion, or last scattering

300
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:29,179
the last time photons and electrons could
interact with each other before

301
00:24:29,179 --> 00:24:33,669
the electrons recombined with protons.
and it is for that reason that we say that

302
00:24:33,669 --> 00:24:38,890
the
milimeter map, the microwave map of the sky,

303
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:41,880
is the map of the cosmological background
radiation,

304
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,270
also known as fossil radiation,
because it bears the imprints of temperature

305
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:50,039
fluctuations
and so the density of the Universe

306
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:55,590
as they were, only 380 000 years
after the Big Bang.

307
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,090
The best description of the world in which
we live

308
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:03,260
is provided by the Big Bang theory.
Far from being perfect,

309
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:06,460
it still explains a large number of concrete
observationnal facts

310
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:11,529
like the expansion of the Universe,
but also the cosmological background temperature

311
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:14,480
and its spatial fluctuations throughout the
sky.

312
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,049
Still, to date,
the accelerated expansion of the Universe,

313
00:25:19,049 --> 00:25:25,090
is 68% dark energy and 27% dark matter
We still cannot find a fully

314
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,390
satisfying explanation.
The solution of the problem will be found

315
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:32,260
through the characterisation
of large scale structures,

316
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:36,660
and so by multi-wavelength observations
of the whole sky.

317
00:25:36,660 --> 00:25:40,809
That has been done here by the Planck satellite,
in the microwave wavelengths,

318
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:45,309
to see the cosmological background radiation.
But the sky will soon be mapped

319
00:25:45,309 --> 00:25:49,210
in optical and the infrared by the ESA Euclid
satellite

320
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:50,780
and by ground-based telescopes.
