1
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:06,198
Up to now,

2
00:00:06,198 --> 00:00:07,955
we have seen how are formed

3
00:00:07,955 --> 00:00:10,719
celestial bodies that compose the universe, how they evolve

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,525
and what are the physical phenomenons

5
00:00:12,525 --> 00:00:15,218
which give them their
mass and luminosity.

6
00:00:15,218 --> 00:00:17,684
But what for the 
Universe as a whole ?

7
00:00:17,684 --> 00:00:21,000
What is its origin?
How does it evolve with time?

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,306
What will become of it ?
What is his global composition ?

9
00:00:24,306 --> 00:00:28,796
All these question are closely linked,
and belong to the field of cosmology.

10
00:00:29,344 --> 00:00:32,108
The theory 
which currently best explains

11
00:00:32,108 --> 00:00:34,372
all observations that 
are at our disposal 

12
00:00:34,372 --> 00:00:38,162
is the Big Bang theory, where 
the Universe was born of one initial explosion,

13
00:00:38,163 --> 00:00:40,779
some 13, 8 billion years ago,

14
00:00:40,779 --> 00:00:44,787
followed by an extremely rapid 
expansion, called inflation,

15
00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:49,577
then, a slower expansion,
as was found in twenties-thirties.

16
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:52,133
Since the years 2000,

17
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:54,870
we know that this 
expansion is accelerated,

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,051
but the reason for this remains
completely unknown.

19
00:00:59,051 --> 00:01:02,791
This can be explained only by invoking
the existence of a repulsive force,

20
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:06,541
due to some unknown form of 
energy called dark energy,

21
00:01:06,542 --> 00:01:09,312
and that would counteract 
the gravitational force,

22
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:12,504
which tends to make the
Universe contract itself.

23
00:01:13,722 --> 00:01:15,923
So we said that the 
Universe is expanding,

24
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:18,352
that doesn't mean that the 
Universe was born in one point

25
00:01:18,352 --> 00:01:20,498
and is expanding like 
a spherical ball.

26
00:01:20,498 --> 00:01:23,687
But it means that all points are
growing further apart from each other 

27
00:01:23,687 --> 00:01:26,877
with some factor,
called the expansion factor.

28
00:01:26,893 --> 00:01:28,823
So for example, here,

29
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:32,891
we have a certain distance which 
becomes longer as the Universe is growing.

30
00:01:32,891 --> 00:01:34,821
We have another distance here,

31
00:01:35,143 --> 00:01:39,523
which also becomes longer
by a certain factor, etc, etc.

32
00:01:39,886 --> 00:01:42,306
and the same for the distance here.

33
00:01:44,516 --> 00:01:49,586
and if we call r' the distance here
and r the distance here between two points,

34
00:01:49,986 --> 00:01:53,806
we have r' = a * r,

35
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:57,562
where a is what we call
the expansion factor.

36
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:03,633
So lets look at this expansion 
in more details.

37
00:02:03,972 --> 00:02:07,382
So here we have a grid
representing the metric

38
00:02:07,382 --> 00:02:10,491
defining how we measure coordinates 
in the Universe .

39
00:02:10,491 --> 00:02:13,201
and this grid will 
evolve with time,

40
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:16,571
so time flows like this.

41
00:02:17,205 --> 00:02:20,686
and we can localize objects on this 
grid in various ways.

42
00:02:20,686 --> 00:02:24,296
For example,
we put an origin here

43
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:28,128
so the origin will be here,

44
00:02:28,635 --> 00:02:31,275
at an instant t later

45
00:02:31,585 --> 00:02:34,695
We take an object 
at a coordinate X.

46
00:02:35,683 --> 00:02:38,301
And when we let the system 
evolve with time,

47
00:02:38,301 --> 00:02:40,513
the X coordinate hasn't changed,

48
00:02:40,513 --> 00:02:45,327
for example, we take a section here
and a section there to go to X.

49
00:02:45,327 --> 00:02:48,719
And we take a section here, 
a section there, to go to X.

50
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:51,589
So X is what we call 
the comobile coordinate,

51
00:02:51,589 --> 00:02:53,875
which moves with the reference grid.

52
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:00,899
We can also localise 
objects in a different way. 

53
00:03:00,899 --> 00:03:06,239
We can say that the distance from
O and X is the distance r, which is here.

54
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:09,567
so r(t).

55
00:03:10,784 --> 00:03:14,580
and then, a moment later,
the distance r(t) has grown.

56
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:18,700
so this r(t) will be equal

57
00:03:18,705 --> 00:03:23,255
to a certain expansion factor
times the co-mobile coordinate.

58
00:03:23,471 --> 00:03:27,531
So a(t) is the expansion 
factor of the Universe.

59
00:03:27,723 --> 00:03:30,792
Now we will see
how all this evolves.

60
00:03:30,792 --> 00:03:36,322
So, as we said, r(t)
is equal to a(t) times X.

61
00:03:37,407 --> 00:03:39,517
Of course we can also write

62
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:44,270
that X = r(t) / a(t).

63
00:03:44,926 --> 00:03:47,456
Then, if we derive the expression
to get the velocity,

64
00:03:47,463 --> 00:03:50,751
we will try here to 
recover Hubble's law.

65
00:03:50,751 --> 00:03:55,424
We will have here da/dt times X
because X doesn't change with time.

66
00:03:55,424 --> 00:03:58,093
So if we input X here, 
we will have,

67
00:03:58,093 --> 00:04:02,503
that r', that is V(r, t),

68
00:04:03,141 --> 00:04:09,259
will be equal to
a'(t)/a(t),

69
00:04:09,259 --> 00:04:10,749
I just introduced X here,

70
00:04:11,412 --> 00:04:13,162
times r(t).

71
00:04:13,822 --> 00:04:16,802
And what we will do here,
we will write that this,

72
00:04:17,278 --> 00:04:21,518
is H(t), and this is the expansion 
rate of the Universe.

73
00:04:24,512 --> 00:04:26,298
So we had an 
expansion factor,

74
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:28,660
a(t), while this is a ratio a'/a,

75
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,720
that is an expansion 
rate. So now,

76
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,671
we can also write

77
00:04:31,671 --> 00:04:34,411
that V(r0, t0),

78
00:04:35,464 --> 00:04:41,694
is equal to H(t0) times r(t0).

79
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:43,189
In other words,

80
00:04:43,189 --> 00:04:47,509
we have here Hubble's law.

81
00:04:47,792 --> 00:04:53,502
Namely, V = H0 times r,

82
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:57,430
that is to say, times the distance
that separates us from an object.

83
00:04:57,435 --> 00:05:01,052
So what we wrote here, is nothing 
other than Hubble's law.

84
00:05:06,348 --> 00:05:08,154
Then, this Hubble expansion law,

85
00:05:08,154 --> 00:05:09,284
we will write it again here:

86
00:05:09,284 --> 00:05:11,943
V = H0 times D.

87
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:15,251
That was Hubble in 1929.

88
00:05:15,255 --> 00:05:18,773
But actually, the idea was also
proposed by Georges Lemaître,

89
00:05:18,773 --> 00:05:22,553
a belgian astrophysicist, in 1927.

90
00:05:23,748 --> 00:05:26,628
Drawing this law, as
we have already seen,

91
00:05:26,956 --> 00:05:31,480
it connects the distance,
long distances indeed,

92
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,500
measured in mega parsecs (Mpc),

93
00:05:33,506 --> 00:05:35,701
to the velocity, 
also large velocities,

94
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:38,548
measured in km per second (km/s).

95
00:05:38,548 --> 00:05:41,553
That is what we call
the recession velocity of galaxies.

96
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:43,813
And we have a linear law

97
00:05:45,018 --> 00:05:49,018
between velocity and distance.

98
00:05:49,197 --> 00:05:52,807
and what H0 measures, is the 
slope of this line.

99
00:05:55,315 --> 00:05:59,519
The present value of H0
isn't very well known.

100
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:02,631
To date there is a 10% error
margin on the exact value,

101
00:06:02,631 --> 00:06:05,523
perhaps a bit better in
the more optimistic cases. 

102
00:06:05,523 --> 00:06:10,683
it amounts to 70 km/s per Mpc.

103
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:15,020
Right, these units may seem
strange but they are indeed km/s

104
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,796
per Mpc that are measured.

105
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:18,844
Now, the units can
be simplified.

106
00:06:18,844 --> 00:06:22,754
The true dimension of H0,
is in fact the inverse of a time.

107
00:06:25,845 --> 00:06:29,038
Thus, 1/H0 belongs of course to 
the time dimension.

108
00:06:29,038 --> 00:06:31,473
and is actually the age of the Universe.

109
00:06:31,473 --> 00:06:32,244
So why?

110
00:06:32,244 --> 00:06:35,154
Becase if we know the distance
and the velocity of a point,

111
00:06:35,694 --> 00:06:38,545
we can find the time needed

112
00:06:38,545 --> 00:06:41,478
for that point to be 
in contact with us.

113
00:06:41,478 --> 00:06:44,048
So, we have an expanding universe,

114
00:06:44,053 --> 00:06:47,138
all points were in contact 
at the beginning,

115
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:49,128
at the Big Bang.

116
00:06:49,128 --> 00:06:53,888
and 1 / H0 later,
13,8 billion years later,

117
00:06:54,492 --> 00:06:56,852
the Universe has its present
shape, its present size.

118
00:06:57,368 --> 00:07:00,563
So we have an expanding universe;
now, what is the link with

119
00:07:00,563 --> 00:07:03,867
what is called the redshift,
the cosmological red shift?

120
00:07:03,867 --> 00:07:07,277
We can write the Doppler effect,

121
00:07:07,769 --> 00:07:08,989
namely the ratio dλ / λ.

122
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,280
This is λ observed minus λ 
emitted divided by λ emitted,

123
00:07:13,486 --> 00:07:17,575
which is equal to dv/c,

124
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:18,815
that is

125
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:21,045
the Doppler effect,

126
00:07:21,668 --> 00:07:24,248
that we had seen in Chapter 3.2.

127
00:07:24,923 --> 00:07:27,088
Now we have seen that
following Hubble's law,

128
00:07:27,088 --> 00:07:31,334
that V equals H times distance,

129
00:07:31,334 --> 00:07:32,926
so here, we have a differential 

130
00:07:32,926 --> 00:07:35,109
hence we also have a differential there.

131
00:07:35,109 --> 00:07:37,519
We have the constant c which stays here.

132
00:07:37,934 --> 00:07:42,114
H, as we said, is a'/a,

133
00:07:43,677 --> 00:07:46,157
and we have dr / c which stays here.

134
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:50,630
Now a certain time dt is needed
to travel the distance dr with the velocity c.

135
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,180
So we could write that as: 

136
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:57,330
(a'/a)*dt.

137
00:07:58,422 --> 00:07:59,770
Now, what does this mean?

138
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:02,550
Re-arranging these two terms here,

139
00:08:02,846 --> 00:08:05,836
it means that dλ / λ is equal...

140
00:08:06,506 --> 00:08:08,502
remembering that a' is da/dt,

141
00:08:08,502 --> 00:08:11,712
and then we have dt/a left. 

142
00:08:11,725 --> 00:08:16,489
So in the end, we obtain dλ /λ = da/a.

143
00:08:16,489 --> 00:08:18,529
This is a differential equation

144
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:19,506
of the first order.

145
00:08:19,506 --> 00:08:20,661
The solution to this,

146
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:23,801
is λ(a) equals a certain constant K

147
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:25,268
times a.

148
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:27,922
Thus, at the present epoch,

149
00:08:29,729 --> 00:08:31,499
we have a = 1,

150
00:08:32,484 --> 00:08:36,500
so we have that λ_emitted (1)

151
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:39,856
is equal to λ_observed.

152
00:08:39,856 --> 00:08:42,382
Because at present, 
the wavelength,

153
00:08:42,382 --> 00:08:44,907
with an expansion factor of 1,

154
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:47,812
the emission and observation 
wavelengths are the same.

155
00:08:47,812 --> 00:08:49,248
So we have a = 1 here,

156
00:08:49,248 --> 00:08:54,838
and this implies that the constant
K is equal to  λ_observed.

157
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:57,509
This is simply the Doppler effect.

158
00:08:57,510 --> 00:09:01,610
For a universe with an expansion factor of 1.

159
00:09:01,977 --> 00:09:04,967
Now, if we re-arrange
the results here,

160
00:09:06,512 --> 00:09:11,782
what we will get is that
λ obs / λ emit

161
00:09:12,792 --> 00:09:14,842
is equal to 1/a.

162
00:09:14,842 --> 00:09:16,742
It is exactly this equation

163
00:09:16,742 --> 00:09:20,332
once we have replaced the 
K constant by λ_obs.

164
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:23,230
We also have the
Doppler effect formula,

165
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:27,510
telling us that
(λ_obs minus λ_emit) / λ_emit

166
00:09:27,961 --> 00:09:29,842
is equal to V/c,
as we have seen,

167
00:09:29,842 --> 00:09:32,279
and we will set this as being equal to z.

168
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:33,549
and this will be,

169
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:37,967
by definition, the famous red shift.

170
00:09:39,235 --> 00:09:42,029
Now, if we gather
these two equations,

171
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,256
we see that we will have :

172
00:09:43,256 --> 00:09:46,556
λ_obs / λ_emit

173
00:09:47,427 --> 00:09:49,217
= 1/a,

174
00:09:49,509 --> 00:09:51,809
namely the inverse of the expansion factor.

175
00:09:51,969 --> 00:09:54,350
But it is also equal to 1 + z.

176
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,310
This implies that, if we 
want to know

177
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,407
the red shift of
an object,

178
00:09:59,407 --> 00:10:03,150
we measure a given 
observed wavelength.

179
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:05,770
let's take for example
a line in a spectrum:

180
00:10:05,778 --> 00:10:09,439
if we know 
its wavelength at rest,

181
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:13,119
in other words the emission wavelength,
the intrinsic wavelength of the line,

182
00:10:13,119 --> 00:10:15,601
then we can find
the redshift z.

183
00:10:16,582 --> 00:10:18,862
That is the well known equation

184
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:22,811
of the cosmological Doppler effect.

185
00:10:25,788 --> 00:10:27,152
Now an example.

186
00:10:27,152 --> 00:10:31,154
Lets take the Hubble Deep Field, as
we did several times before in this class.

187
00:10:31,154 --> 00:10:34,505
We see that there are many 
galaxies of all colours.

188
00:10:34,505 --> 00:10:38,501
Some are blue,
others are rather green,

189
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:41,587
yet others are red, like here,
and there are two reason for that.

190
00:10:41,587 --> 00:10:44,267
First of all, galaxies
have intrinsic colours.

191
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:47,326
Some have blue and 
hot stars, just born.

192
00:10:47,326 --> 00:10:49,541
Such galaxies have an intrinsic
blue colour.

193
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:52,974
Others will have for example
a lot of dust making their colour redder,

194
00:10:52,974 --> 00:10:55,115
or contain a population of old stars,

195
00:10:55,115 --> 00:10:56,088
with low masses.

196
00:10:56,088 --> 00:10:57,478
So there are multiple reasons

197
00:10:57,478 --> 00:10:59,807
for the observed colours of galaxies. 

198
00:10:59,807 --> 00:11:02,961
But one additional reason is the
cosmological red shift.

199
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:06,051
For that we can draw

200
00:11:06,052 --> 00:11:08,772
the spectrum of a galaxy

201
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,541
in a schematic way.

202
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,463
So a galaxy spectrum
resembles this.

203
00:11:13,463 --> 00:11:15,211
There are stars in a galaxy,

204
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:18,121
so we will have the Break

205
00:11:18,121 --> 00:11:20,556
at 4 000 angströms,
Balmer's Break,

206
00:11:20,556 --> 00:11:23,256
that we had already seen in the 
chapter dedicated to hydrogen.

207
00:11:23,256 --> 00:11:25,300
So here, we have a typical feature

208
00:11:25,675 --> 00:11:27,725
at 4 000 angströms,

209
00:11:27,971 --> 00:11:29,264
if the galaxy is at rest,

210
00:11:29,264 --> 00:11:31,977
without any cosmological red shift.

211
00:11:31,977 --> 00:11:34,572
Now this is the wavelength,

212
00:11:34,572 --> 00:11:37,752
of λ_emission when at rest.

213
00:11:37,755 --> 00:11:42,275
And λ_observed will be equal to (1 + z)

214
00:11:43,324 --> 00:11:44,842
times λ_emitted.

215
00:11:44,842 --> 00:11:48,361
So, if we have an object
with a very high red shift,

216
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:49,701
5 for instance,

217
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:52,968
we will multiply 4000 by 5+1 or 6.

218
00:11:53,242 --> 00:11:54,272
So we will have

219
00:11:54,272 --> 00:11:57,498
wavelengths that will move 
like this, far into the red.

220
00:11:57,499 --> 00:12:00,643
I will put here again the wavelength, and
there the flux, since we have a spectrum,

221
00:12:00,643 --> 00:12:02,803
so we will multiply the whole spectrum

222
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:05,269
by that factor (1 + z).

223
00:12:06,051 --> 00:12:08,770
So we will find here again the break,

224
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,725
that was seen before at rest, 
but now (1 + z) times farther. 

225
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:15,665
and the spectrum will be
stretched by a factor (1 + z).

226
00:12:15,805 --> 00:12:19,565
So everything is stretched
by a factor (1 + z) in cosmology. 

227
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:22,351
So now, if I add filters

228
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:23,901
to this,

229
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:25,582
for example

230
00:12:25,582 --> 00:12:27,672
a filter here,

231
00:12:29,211 --> 00:12:31,291
and a filter there,

232
00:12:31,307 --> 00:12:33,674
and one here, and then 
I integrate the light

233
00:12:33,674 --> 00:12:36,594
as we did before in
the first chapters of this course,

234
00:12:36,594 --> 00:12:40,854
i will have a lot of flux here
in an infrared filter for example.

235
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,285
Here, considering 
the red filter,

236
00:12:43,285 --> 00:12:46,182
I will have a moderate flux,

237
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:49,732
and then almost no
flux at all in the blue.

238
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:52,916
Now if we make a true colour
image of a galaxy,

239
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:55,856
with this spectral distribution,

240
00:12:55,856 --> 00:12:57,997
we will have typically, a galaxy,

241
00:12:57,997 --> 00:12:59,627
as we can see here,

242
00:13:00,378 --> 00:13:03,285
which will appear very red
in a true colour image.

243
00:13:03,285 --> 00:13:05,855
Of course, all
intermediate situations occur.

244
00:13:05,855 --> 00:13:09,536
In images like these, you can
find galaxies with any colours.

245
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:12,911
First, because they have 
an intrinsic colour, and second,

246
00:13:12,911 --> 00:13:16,293
because they have a certain
cosmological red shift.

247
00:13:16,293 --> 00:13:17,830
Remember, the universe 
is expanding.

248
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:20,859
and a simple way to determine
whether it will expand forever or not,

249
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:24,043
is to see whether the system 
is bound or not,

250
00:13:24,043 --> 00:13:26,263
I mean the universe as a whole.

251
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:32,987
So, is the universe bound or not?

252
00:13:34,098 --> 00:13:36,159
Is it a gravitationally bound system?

253
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,303
So we write the equilibrium

254
00:13:37,303 --> 00:13:39,743
between the kinetic energy
and the potential energy.

255
00:13:39,993 --> 00:13:41,674
Here M is the mass
of the Universe.

256
00:13:41,674 --> 00:13:45,231
R is its radius, or characteristic
radius, V the velocity

257
00:13:45,231 --> 00:13:47,765
of a test particle in the Universe.

258
00:13:47,765 --> 00:13:51,178
This is 0, so it would be the
total energy of the Universe.

259
00:13:51,178 --> 00:13:56,028
Now, we have seen that V is H_0 R,

260
00:13:56,229 --> 00:13:59,799
namely H0 times a distance, squared here.

261
00:14:00,169 --> 00:14:02,526
We move the 2 to the
other side of the equation.

262
00:14:02,526 --> 00:14:06,886
thus obtaining 2 G M / R.

263
00:14:07,352 --> 00:14:10,958
and this, if we assume
a constant density,

264
00:14:10,958 --> 00:14:14,948
will equal 2 G / R times ρ

265
00:14:15,598 --> 00:14:18,398
times 4/3 π R³.

266
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:22,285
This allows us to define a density,

267
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:24,591
which can be defined as a critical density,

268
00:14:24,631 --> 00:14:31,181
the value of which is 3/8 (H0²/Gπ).

269
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:35,275
So this ρ is what we call

270
00:14:35,627 --> 00:14:38,527
the critical density of the Universe.

271
00:14:39,038 --> 00:14:41,460
it is such that, if ρ is larger than ρ_critical,

272
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:44,428
then the potential energy is
larger then the kinetic one

273
00:14:44,428 --> 00:14:46,197
and we have a contraction, or at least

274
00:14:46,197 --> 00:14:49,517
a fading expansion.
And if ρ is smaller than ρ_critical,

275
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:51,825
then we have an everlasting expansion. 

276
00:14:51,825 --> 00:14:55,282
So we can see that the density of the Universe

277
00:14:55,282 --> 00:14:58,102
is of crucial and far-reaching importance

278
00:14:58,379 --> 00:15:00,519
regarding the future of the universe.

279
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,918
For that reason, 
it is extremly important

280
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:06,315
to understand the energy balance, 
the different density contributions, 

281
00:15:06,315 --> 00:15:08,855
of the different components of our universe.

282
00:15:10,119 --> 00:15:11,927
Currently, the very fact

283
00:15:11,927 --> 00:15:15,037
that the Universe
is undergoing accelerated expansion

284
00:15:16,233 --> 00:15:19,103
implies, within the framework
of the Big Bang model,

285
00:15:19,517 --> 00:15:23,517
that we have 68% of dark energy;

286
00:15:24,745 --> 00:15:26,770
that is the energy balance 
of the Universe.

287
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:28,948
This dark energy is repulsive,

288
00:15:28,948 --> 00:15:31,836
and explains or mimics

289
00:15:31,836 --> 00:15:34,526
a Universe undergoing accelerated expansion.

290
00:15:35,532 --> 00:15:38,792
On the other hand we have
27% of dark matter,

291
00:15:39,478 --> 00:15:41,194
which is subject to gravity,

292
00:15:41,194 --> 00:15:44,098
and as such, tends to 
make the universe contract;

293
00:15:44,098 --> 00:15:48,168
and the proportions we have here 
result in a universe in accelerated expansion.

294
00:15:48,171 --> 00:15:50,867
And than, we have a very small fraction

295
00:15:50,867 --> 00:15:53,337
of the total energy content, 5%,

296
00:15:54,261 --> 00:15:58,971
which is normal matter,
called baryonic matter.

297
00:16:00,401 --> 00:16:01,952
So this baryonic matter includes

298
00:16:01,952 --> 00:16:05,474
the proton and neutrons, and 
by extension the electrons

299
00:16:05,474 --> 00:16:08,929
that are not baryons but actually
leptons, but are associated 

300
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:11,893
with normal matter, which 
is called normal, or baryonic.

301
00:16:11,893 --> 00:16:13,376
Some of this matter 

302
00:16:13,376 --> 00:16:14,536
Some of this matter 

303
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,170
which emits radiation, 

304
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:20,508
is fact the subject of all this course,

305
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,930
so "normal" matter,

306
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:26,763
but that doesn't emit light
or light at 

307
00:16:26,763 --> 00:16:28,530
the wavelengths we can observe.

308
00:16:28,530 --> 00:16:30,536
And there is also dark matter

309
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:31,977
that does not emit any light at all,

310
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:34,272
at any wavelength, we
have no idea

311
00:16:34,272 --> 00:16:35,037
of what it is.

312
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:36,798
So if we talk about dark matter,

313
00:16:36,798 --> 00:16:38,008
it can be two things :

314
00:16:38,008 --> 00:16:41,523
either dark matter, here of which 
we have absolutely no idea,

315
00:16:41,523 --> 00:16:45,753
or normal baryonic matter
but which we cannot see

316
00:16:45,753 --> 00:16:47,994
because either it doesn't
emit enough light,

317
00:16:47,994 --> 00:16:51,239
or it emits at wavelengths 
we do not observe.

318
00:16:51,239 --> 00:16:54,213
So now, these 5 %
of baryonic light,

319
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,513
has a mass distribution as follows:

320
00:16:57,672 --> 00:17:00,789
5 % of "normal" (baryonic) matter,

321
00:17:00,789 --> 00:17:04,514
which are composed 80%
of gas, only 20 % of stars,

322
00:17:04,514 --> 00:17:06,369
and 0.1 % of dust,

323
00:17:06,369 --> 00:17:08,546
you remember 
these dark lines

324
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:11,040
that absorb the 
light in galaxies,

325
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:12,243
and dark holes,

326
00:17:12,243 --> 00:17:14,689
even if they are 
very compact objects,

327
00:17:14,689 --> 00:17:15,930
they are very few of them,

328
00:17:15,930 --> 00:17:20,530
and represent only 0.01% 
of the energy or the mass.

329
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,052
So these numbers

330
00:17:23,052 --> 00:17:27,560
are taken from observations of the Cosmic 
Microwave Background (CMB) radiation.

331
00:17:27,560 --> 00:17:28,947
What's it is all about? 

332
00:17:28,947 --> 00:17:29,650
First of all

333
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:34,770
it's a black body radiation

334
00:17:36,909 --> 00:17:42,979
whose temperature is 2,728 degrees K

335
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:46,028
and there are small spatial variations

336
00:17:46,028 --> 00:17:48,477
of temperature of 
around 10 to the power -5.

337
00:17:48,477 --> 00:17:50,362
Now if we take the
mean temperature

338
00:17:50,362 --> 00:17:55,132
over the whole sky
we will find a perfect black body,

339
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,224
which is represented
by this curve here,

340
00:17:57,224 --> 00:18:00,314
measured by the COBE satellite,

341
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:03,829
which stands for the « Cosmic Background Explorer ».

342
00:18:04,756 --> 00:18:06,774
Its an American satellite,

343
00:18:06,774 --> 00:18:07,923
from NASA,

344
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:11,403
which has measured for the first time 
the temperature of the cosmological background.

345
00:18:11,403 --> 00:18:14,697
So the black body radiation is
a radiation at 2, 728 K.

346
00:18:14,697 --> 00:18:16,619
We measure the temperature
of the sky background

347
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:20,267
everywhere, in all directions of the
universe isotropically, 

348
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:25,267
equals to 2, 728 degrés K,
with small variations of 10-5.

349
00:18:25,506 --> 00:18:29,427
At the beginning, just after the Big Bang
the Universe had a much larger temperature

350
00:18:29,427 --> 00:18:30,604
temperatures of course,

351
00:18:30,604 --> 00:18:32,518
that cooled down due 
to the expansion

352
00:18:32,518 --> 00:18:33,828
and at the present time,

353
00:18:34,681 --> 00:18:37,821
the temperature is 2,728 degrees K.

354
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:42,264
So, what is the history behind the 
discovery of the cosmological background ?

355
00:18:42,264 --> 00:18:43,507
First of all,

356
00:18:43,507 --> 00:18:45,734
come the first observations
by Penzias and Wilson,

357
00:18:45,734 --> 00:18:48,504
who observed with
a telecomunication antenna

358
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:53,376
at a wavelength of 1,063 mm,

359
00:18:53,771 --> 00:18:56,985
so in the micro waves, 

360
00:18:56,985 --> 00:19:00,698
They observed in different directions
on the sky and each time,

361
00:19:00,698 --> 00:19:05,547
observed a background 
noise corresponding

362
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:09,050
to a black body radiation
at 2,728 degrees K.

363
00:19:09,050 --> 00:19:10,860
So they observed with
an antenna

364
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,845
that didn't permit them to 
construct a map of the sky,

365
00:19:13,845 --> 00:19:15,605
but they observed that

366
00:19:15,606 --> 00:19:18,470
wherever they did the measurement 
on the sky background,

367
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,893
if they observed here, here 
or here or anywhere,

368
00:19:21,893 --> 00:19:25,251
they were measuring 2, 728 degrees K.

369
00:19:25,251 --> 00:19:27,541
So these maps, that we see often

370
00:19:27,796 --> 00:19:30,183
represented like this
in an oval shape,

371
00:19:30,183 --> 00:19:33,296
they are in galactic coordinates. 

372
00:19:33,296 --> 00:19:35,156
So we have here ,

373
00:19:35,156 --> 00:19:37,541
the galactic longitude 
and latitude

374
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:38,702
we already saw 

375
00:19:38,702 --> 00:19:42,213
in the chapter about 
the Oort constants.

376
00:19:42,213 --> 00:19:45,012
We have the whole sky map here,

377
00:19:45,012 --> 00:19:47,578
as seen by the antenna of Penzias and Wilson,

378
00:19:47,578 --> 00:19:50,258
then seen by the COBE satellite.

379
00:19:50,982 --> 00:19:55,212
Its the « Cosmic Background Explorer »,

380
00:19:55,865 --> 00:19:59,807
which measured and obtained 
the first sky map in 1992.

381
00:19:59,807 --> 00:20:02,848
What you see here 
is the millimeter image

382
00:20:02,848 --> 00:20:04,066
of the Milky Way.

383
00:20:04,066 --> 00:20:06,368
By improving the observations

384
00:20:06,368 --> 00:20:11,928
with the « Wilkinson Microwave
Background Anisotropy Probe »,

385
00:20:13,550 --> 00:20:17,135
we can see more and more 
details in the map

386
00:20:17,135 --> 00:20:18,861
of the cosmological 
background radiation.

387
00:20:19,631 --> 00:20:21,295
There are still 

388
00:20:21,295 --> 00:20:24,515
around 30 years each observation.

389
00:20:25,980 --> 00:20:29,602
So this cosmological background 
radiation is not observed easily.

390
00:20:29,602 --> 00:20:31,507
The observation of Penzias and Wilson,

391
00:20:31,507 --> 00:20:33,507
is a constant over
the whole of the sky.

392
00:20:33,507 --> 00:20:35,853
but we have to take 
into account that the Milky Way

393
00:20:35,853 --> 00:20:37,903
is moving in the sky,

394
00:20:37,907 --> 00:20:42,517
and so we go towards a point 
that can be found here.

395
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:46,505
Of course, if we look in the direction 
opposite to the movement, 

396
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:49,770
we find ourselves here and 
so we see a "bluer" sky, a bluer wavelength

397
00:20:51,039 --> 00:20:54,584
in the direction of the motion,
and redder in the opposite direction,

398
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:57,013
due to the Doppler effect,
So what we see here

399
00:20:57,013 --> 00:20:59,833
is what we call the 
"cosmological dipole",

400
00:21:00,732 --> 00:21:02,404
because they are two 
poles like this.

401
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:05,130
and this is simply due to the 
movement of the Milky Way,

402
00:21:05,130 --> 00:21:07,367
with respect to the cosmological
background radiation.

403
00:21:07,367 --> 00:21:09,334
Now the velocity of the Milky Way,

404
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:11,814
with respect to the cosmological 
background radiation,

405
00:21:11,814 --> 00:21:16,244
measured through the 
Doppler dipole,

406
00:21:16,491 --> 00:21:22,891
is V = 627 ± 22 km/s.

407
00:21:25,132 --> 00:21:27,047
Thanks to the
Doppler effect,

408
00:21:27,047 --> 00:21:29,217
we have some sort of absolute referential here,

409
00:21:29,217 --> 00:21:33,102
that allows us to measure the
proper motion of the Milky Way

410
00:21:33,102 --> 00:21:35,032
in the Universe.

411
00:21:35,452 --> 00:21:39,542
So now if we substract this
Doppler effect we finally obtain

412
00:21:39,544 --> 00:21:43,739
the map of the cosmological
background radiation 

413
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:45,807
with also here the image
of the Milky Way.

414
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:49,297
The cosmological information
is of course hidden by the Milky Way. 

415
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:51,637
But the Milky Way can be removed thanks to 
multi frequency maps,

416
00:21:51,637 --> 00:21:53,602
obtained here with 
the Planck satellite,

417
00:21:53,602 --> 00:21:56,147
which is the last satellite
to have taken CMB measurements.

418
00:21:56,147 --> 00:21:58,258
So this is recent, 2013-2014.

419
00:21:58,258 --> 00:22:00,798
By taking multi frequency maps

420
00:22:00,808 --> 00:22:02,095
of the sky

421
00:22:02,095 --> 00:22:07,684
we can, thanks to the apparent 
change of the Milky Way shape,

422
00:22:07,684 --> 00:22:11,113
substract it to get the final image,

423
00:22:11,113 --> 00:22:12,403
which is here.

424
00:22:12,974 --> 00:22:15,625
So this is the map obtained
by the Planck satellite,

425
00:22:15,625 --> 00:22:18,530
it's a temperature map
of course,

426
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:23,166
the average of the temperatures
is 2,728 degrees K.

427
00:22:23,166 --> 00:22:25,220
and there are small
fluctuations around it.

428
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,234
So this red points here are
slightly hotter than this,

429
00:22:28,234 --> 00:22:30,972
and the blue points slightly 
colder, with variations

430
00:22:30,972 --> 00:22:35,121
of temperature that are Δt/t,
as we have already said

431
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,931
around 10 to the power -5.

432
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,676
The cosmological information
is contained in fact,

433
00:22:41,676 --> 00:22:44,699
in the statistical distribution
of these small points and this 

434
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:47,809
is what we want to measure
very precisely at small scales,

435
00:22:47,809 --> 00:22:49,384
but also at large scales.

436
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:52,113
Because this is what the Big 
Bang theory predicts.

437
00:22:52,113 --> 00:22:54,165
So we will try to
make observations

438
00:22:54,165 --> 00:22:56,548
that we will confront to the theory.

439
00:22:56,548 --> 00:22:59,288
Or in other words, we will confront
the theory to the observations. 

440
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:02,241
So what is the cause 
of the fluctuations?

441
00:23:02,241 --> 00:23:06,754
When the Universe was born
it was extremely hot,

442
00:23:06,754 --> 00:23:11,608
then the temperature decreased
and while the Universe was younger

443
00:23:11,608 --> 00:23:13,998
than 380 000 ans,

444
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,250
we had a hot Plasma.

445
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:25,280
So hot that photons and 
electrons were seperated.

446
00:23:26,293 --> 00:23:28,389
The gas was totally ionized

447
00:23:28,389 --> 00:23:29,779
So now the photons

448
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:32,530
present in the gas at that time,

449
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:35,806
were constantly in interaction with 
the electrons, they were in fact

450
00:23:35,806 --> 00:23:38,027
all the time scattered 
by electrons,

451
00:23:38,027 --> 00:23:42,077
until the moment where, due
to the decreasing temperature of the Universe,

452
00:23:42,915 --> 00:23:44,495
because of the expansion,

453
00:23:45,448 --> 00:23:49,528
so when t dimishes,
this intervenes 

454
00:23:50,005 --> 00:23:52,845
at a time t = 380 000 years

455
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,031
after the Big Bang

456
00:23:56,031 --> 00:23:57,362
So a that moment, we have

457
00:23:57,362 --> 00:24:01,551
what the recombination
between protons and electrons.

458
00:24:01,551 --> 00:24:04,594
So now, if protons and 
electrons recombine, 

459
00:24:04,594 --> 00:24:08,323
this produces hydrogen, with the consequence
that photons cannot anymore 

460
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:09,757
be scattered by electrons.

461
00:24:09,757 --> 00:24:14,067
So photons propagate straight through a Universe

462
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:18,821
that is completely transparent 
to light and reach us.

463
00:24:18,993 --> 00:24:21,564
So what we see here 
is what we call

464
00:24:21,564 --> 00:24:23,156
the surface of last diffusion, or last scattering

465
00:24:23,156 --> 00:24:28,506
the last time photons and electrons 
could interact with each other before

466
00:24:28,511 --> 00:24:30,946
the electrons recombined with protons.

467
00:24:30,946 --> 00:24:34,526
and it is for that reason that we say that the

468
00:24:35,123 --> 00:24:37,823
milimeter map, the microwave 
map of the sky,

469
00:24:38,273 --> 00:24:41,069
is the map of the cosmological 
background radiation,

470
00:24:41,069 --> 00:24:42,796
also known as fossil radiation,

471
00:24:42,796 --> 00:24:47,685
because it bears the imprints 
of temperature fluctuations

472
00:24:47,685 --> 00:24:49,345
and so the density of the Universe

473
00:24:49,345 --> 00:24:51,798
as they were, only 380 000 years

474
00:24:51,798 --> 00:24:53,308
after the Big Bang.

475
00:24:55,044 --> 00:24:58,425
The best description of the world
in which we live

476
00:24:58,425 --> 00:25:00,545
is provided by
the Big Bang theory.

477
00:25:00,972 --> 00:25:02,499
Far from being perfect,

478
00:25:02,499 --> 00:25:05,897
it still explains a large
number of concrete observationnal facts

479
00:25:05,897 --> 00:25:08,514
like the expansion
of the Universe,

480
00:25:08,514 --> 00:25:10,671
but also the cosmological 
background temperature

481
00:25:10,671 --> 00:25:13,841
and its spatial fluctuations
throughout the sky.

482
00:25:14,354 --> 00:25:15,943
Still, to date,

483
00:25:15,943 --> 00:25:18,321
the accelerated expansion of the Universe,

484
00:25:18,321 --> 00:25:22,509
is 68% dark energy
and 27% dark matter

485
00:25:22,509 --> 00:25:24,426
We still cannot find a fully

486
00:25:24,426 --> 00:25:26,276
satisfying explanation.

487
00:25:26,494 --> 00:25:29,392
The solution of the problem
will be found through the characterisation  

488
00:25:29,392 --> 00:25:31,398
of large scale structures,

489
00:25:31,398 --> 00:25:32,803
and so by multi-wavelength observations

490
00:25:32,803 --> 00:25:35,533
of the whole sky.

491
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:38,504
That has been done here
by the Planck satellite,

492
00:25:38,504 --> 00:25:40,321
in the microwave wavelengths,

493
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:42,471
to see the cosmological 
background radiation.

494
00:25:42,471 --> 00:25:44,646
But the sky will soon be mapped

495
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:48,546
in optical and the infrared by
the ESA Euclid satellite 

496
00:25:48,548 --> 00:25:50,228
and by ground-based telescopes.
