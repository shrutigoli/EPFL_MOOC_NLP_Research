1
00:00:06,830 --> 00:00:11,020
In this very last video, we will see a natural
phenomenon

2
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,340
which is extremely useful to astrophysicist
and cosmologist,

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:21,020
the gravitational lensing phenomenon.
It's a phenomenon also known as gravitational

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:23,869
"mirage"
by analogy with the optical mirages observed

5
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:27,140
in the desert.
As the name suggests, it is about the deviation

6
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:30,820
of light
not due to a changing refraction index

7
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,250
in the propagation medium, but due to a strong
gravitational field,

8
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,950
as the one created by a galaxy, a star, a
cluster of galaxies.

9
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,910
As it passes near a massive object in the
foreground,

10
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:46,220
the light coming from a distant body will
be deviated so that

11
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:50,890
the background object will be distorted by
the foreground object,

12
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:54,720
and by studying the manner in which the object
is distorted,

13
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,640
we can deduce the matter, visible or not,
in the foreground object

14
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,190
which is then called a gravitational lens.
We have already seen gravitational lenses

15
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,100
during this class.
For example in the galaxy cluster here with

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:14,580
a Redshift of 0,397
with a mass of 10^15 solar mass,

17
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:20,210
this is an excellent gravitational lens.
By zooming on the external parts of the cluster,

18
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:25,310
we can see that there is a whole series of
blue arcs which are

19
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:29,280
the distorted image of distant galaxies by
gravitational lens effect

20
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,660
in the background of the galaxy cluster, which
you see here and

21
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,700
which is shown in greenish colours
So we will see in this class how the gravitational

22
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,390
lens
effect works and why it's such a precious

23
00:01:41,390 --> 00:01:44,640
tool
for an astrophysicist.

24
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,490
We have seen that the gravitational lens effect
is essentially

25
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:55,650
a light deflection effect.
We will see how to draw this.

26
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:58,850
So a light ray arrives in the proximity of
a mass,

27
00:01:58,850 --> 00:02:04,500
here the Sun, which I represent arbitrarily
The ray will be deviated, we have for example

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:13,459
here a velocity vector
which will be the light velocity.

29
00:02:13,459 --> 00:02:21,670
The ray will be deviated.
and to get that deviation we will have an

30
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,240
acceleration.
So acceleration does not mean we will have

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,560
velocities
faster then light,

32
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,580
but we will have a deviation of the light
ray,

33
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,090
we will have a changing velocity.
We will have a photon that arrives with the

34
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,380
velocity of light.
We will have a photon leaving, after deflection,

35
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:44,640
with the velocity of light
and then we will have a velocity difference

36
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,260
vector.
So the photon will be accelerated for a while.

37
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:58,110
We will get back later on this "for a while"
the photon arrives with a certain impact parameter

38
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:03,420
that we will call B, relative to the Sun
or any mass that deviates light.

39
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:07,920
What we intend to compute is the deflection
angle

40
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,360
we call alpha^ here.
So this deflection angle, if we do some trigonometry

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:20,110
we see that alpha ^ = the norm of Delta V
over the norm of our velocity vector, c.

42
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:26,140
Keeping in mind that alpha ^ is always very
small,

43
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:29,780
of the order of a few tenths of an arcsecond,
or of one arcsecond

44
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:40,270
in the strongest cases.
Now delta V, what is it?

45
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:48,300
It's the acceleration of the photon due to
the Sun in this case here.

46
00:03:48,300 --> 00:04:01,569
So GM/ b² during some time delta t.
So this, is the acceleration during some time,

47
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:05,989
it is indeed a velocity.
Now the "some time" is just an order of magnitude

48
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:09,209
here.
We can say that the photon feels the acceleration,

49
00:04:09,209 --> 00:04:12,129
will be under the influence of the gravity
field of the Sun

50
00:04:12,129 --> 00:04:16,489
during "some time" which will be of the order
of magnitude b/c.

51
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:24,809
Beware, this is simply an order of magnitude.
Now if we take all these equations together,

52
00:04:24,809 --> 00:04:36,039
we will find that a is proportionnal to GM/c²b.
But what we especially see is that the deflection

53
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:40,550
angle depends only
on the lens mass, the impact parameter and

54
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:49,309
physical constants
and in particular, α does not depend on wavelength.

55
00:04:49,309 --> 00:04:55,319
rather α ^, sorry.
So, counterintuitively, the deviation

56
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,970
of a light ray does not depend upon energy
or wavelength.

57
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:02,340
In this case here, the result is that, if
we put an observer

58
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:12,379
here, instead of seeing the source where it
was without the Sun,

59
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:19,150
namely in this direction, we will see the
light source

60
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:22,589
so if we had a light source here, one would
see it in the direction

61
00:05:22,589 --> 00:05:26,210
of this ray here, hence in this direction
here.

62
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:31,000
Here we also have α ^.
The deflection angle of light by a massive

63
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,129
object was measured
for the first time in 1919 during a Solar

64
00:05:36,129 --> 00:05:39,949
eclipse.
Note that these ideas are not new.

65
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:46,499
Actually, Newton had already raised the possibility
of light deviation by mass.

66
00:05:46,499 --> 00:05:50,879
But it is in fact Einstein who predicted the
phenomenon

67
00:05:50,879 --> 00:05:55,479
for the first time in unpublished notes in
1912.

68
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:02,349
However, the observation only came later on.
The observation, which actually provided evidence

69
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:14,479
for Einstein's general relativity theory,
was made in 1919 by Arthur Eddington,

70
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:18,069
an English astrophysicist, during a solar
eclipse.

71
00:06:18,069 --> 00:06:23,649
Note that the measurement principle is simple:
we choose a stellar field.

72
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:30,629
So, if we observe it during the night, we
will of course see stars

73
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:39,039
at certain positions relative to the Sun.
So this is a moment when the Sun is not in

74
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,559
the field of view.
The white points are the positions where the

75
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:47,849
stars would be
if we observed them during the night.

76
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:52,960
Now we put before the stars a certain mass,
but since the Sun is bright, we will only

77
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,449
see the stars during a solar eclipse.
So here, during the eclipse, light rays coming

78
00:06:58,449 --> 00:07:01,589
from the stars
will be deflected by the Sun and what we will

79
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:12,499
see are stars
fleeing the sun radially like this.

80
00:07:12,499 --> 00:07:15,669
I'm drawing arrows of different lengths and
the length of each arrow is

81
00:07:15,669 --> 00:07:19,289
inversely proportional to the impact parameter
B,

82
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:22,899
namely the projected distance on the sky between
star and sun.

83
00:07:22,899 --> 00:07:29,610
So here is the deviation angle of light,
each time in the radial direction.

84
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,210
So the new star positions with the sun present
in the field of view,

85
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:38,639
will be the new positions indicated by red
dots.

86
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:45,050
Now, how far does this validate general relativity
?

87
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:51,819
If we measure, or rather predict, the α ^ angle
using Newton's theory,

88
00:07:51,819 --> 00:08:02,880
namely the little demonstration we made earlier,
we would predict 2GM/c²b

89
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:06,139
but α^(Einstein), using the general relativity
theory

90
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:20,309
gives back twice that value,
that is 4GM/c²b,

91
00:08:20,309 --> 00:08:24,869
where M is the Sun's mass and b the Sun's
radius

92
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:28,080
and if we took a star which would lie just
at the edge of the Sun,

93
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,439
assuming that we can perfectly measure a star
at the edge of the Sun.

94
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:35,219
Otherwise we would need to rescale by the
factor b that we have here.

95
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:41,080
So now the numerical values we have,
are that α^ is 1,75 arcseconds in solar mass

96
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,870
units.
Therefore, if we put solar masses here, b

97
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:54,820
/ (solar radius ^ - 1).
That, provided we express b in solar radius

98
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,470
units.
The measurement taken by Eddington gave 1.75

99
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:08,820
arcseconds, which is
actually the numerical value predicted by

100
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:13,970
general relativity .
So the fundamental difference between α(Newton)

101
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:19,940
and α(Einstein)
is that, using Newton's theory of gravity,

102
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:26,360
we have photons following curved trajectories
in an Euclidean space.

103
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,270
In the framework of the general relativity
theory

104
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:32,490
we find that photons travel along straight
trajectories

105
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:39,030
in a curved space, in other words trajectories
that minimise the travel time of photons,

106
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:43,130
so what we call geodetics; and these trajectories
are those

107
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:48,340
of shortest travel length in a curved space.
So we have two radically different interpretations

108
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:51,450
of gravitation,
and this is what is crucial, and has given

109
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:57,120
all the legitimacy
to the general relativity theory,

110
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:02,610
since we construe gravitationnal fields
as acceleeration fields and not anymore as

111
00:10:02,610 --> 00:10:05,580
forces
that masses feel.

112
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,620
So here we have a beautiful confirmation of
the general relativity theory,

113
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,270
simply because the angle measured by Eddington
is exactly equal

114
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:17,930
to the angle predicted by the general relativity
theory.

115
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:21,890
So now let's see how all this works in more
details.

116
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:29,590
We have three important planes,
if we draw the situation simply.

117
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,491
We have a source represented in orange
which is affected by the lens effect, here

118
00:10:33,491 --> 00:10:38,470
on the lens plane.
This lens can be anything:

119
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:42,700
a star, the sun or another star, a galaxy,
a cluster of galaxies,

120
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,250
or even, as we shall see, the great structures
of the universe.

121
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:51,529
So the source can be imaged.
So light will be deviated by an angle alpha

122
00:10:51,529 --> 00:10:56,950
^ that we computed earlier
and the source will be displaced and distorted

123
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:02,850
by the gravitational lens effect.
Now the source is located on the sky by an

124
00:11:02,850 --> 00:11:09,330
angle β
relative to an arbitrary position.

125
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:14,341
We will take here a reference point.
The position of the images on the sky, as

126
00:11:14,341 --> 00:11:20,000
seen from Earth,
is located by an angle θ

127
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,180
and then, we also have an angle α which of
course depends upon θ.

128
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:32,280
We also have different distances here.
We have the distance from observer to source.

129
00:11:32,280 --> 00:11:37,800
the distance from lens to source and the distance
of the lens.

130
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,050
And these distances are angular diameter distances.
Now we have a very simple relation between

131
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,880
those three angles.
That is the lens equation.

132
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:52,730
We have β = θ - α(θ).
That is what we call the reduced deflection

133
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:55,280
angle.
Beware, it's α, not α ^.

134
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,820
It is of course related to α ^, we will see
that later.

135
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:02,160
Now we can also express things as a function
of linear distances

136
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,250
in the different planes.
we will put η here and ζ there, which will

137
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:12,940
depend upon θ,
because if θ changes, ζ changes accordingly.

138
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:18,210
We can even rewrite the lens equation.
So here we have angles, there linear distances,

139
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,760
and
playing a bit of trigonometry, we will find

140
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,740
this :
η = Δl/Δl ζ - Δls α ^, so there, the

141
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:35,320
α^ appears.
Thus, the relation between α(θ) and α ^,

142
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:40,730
again by doing some trigonometry in the similar
triangles here,

143
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:53,310
we get α(θ) = Δls /Δ s * α ^ (ζ).
So there are some different forms of the very

144
00:12:53,310 --> 00:12:56,090
simple equation
that is called the lens equation and which

145
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,110
relates the different angles,
or angular positions.

146
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:03,240
Let's consider the angular positions of the
various objects on the plane of the sky,

147
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,420
β for the source,
θ for the images, and α, the reduced deviation

148
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:12,290
angle.
we can also relate the linear distances to

149
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:17,360
the different planes, but for
that we have to know the

150
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,420
angular diameter distances between the different
objects.

151
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,490
An extremely important, characteristic quantity
is

152
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:28,320
Einstein's radius.
If the source, lens and observer are aligned,

153
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:35,860
then we have β = 0, where the β angle represents
the position of the source on the sky.

154
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:40,810
So, if everything is aligned, we have β = 0,
which means that

155
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:48,470
the lens equation is greatly simplified.
So we have θ = α(θ).

156
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:55,610
It's a simplified version of the lens equation.
So now α(θ), we have seen that it was Δls

157
00:13:55,610 --> 00:14:05,710
/Δ s * α ^(ζ).
with ζ, if we look at the earlier figure

158
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:10,280
again,
and if we do some trigonometry, we have that

159
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:14,460
ζ is linked to θ through
the distance to the lens, from Earth to the

160
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,070
lens.
What does it mean exactly? It implies that

161
00:14:17,070 --> 00:14:33,900
θ = Δls /Δ s * GM/c²ζ.
that is α(θ), which we linked to α^

162
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:46,300
So all that will be equal to Δls /Δ s * GM/
(c² θ Δl).

163
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:53,240
Here, we have a θ here, a θ there,
This θ on the other side, i will have a θe

164
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:59,770
which will be Einstein's radius
equal to √(GM / c²) - M is the lens mass

165
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:12,560
-
and we will have a distance ratio Δs/Δl.

166
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:21,350
So θe is Einstein's radius.
that means that, if we have

167
00:15:21,350 --> 00:15:27,780
a source aligned with the observer
and then we have a lens, a small spiral galaxy

168
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,050
for example,
then the light will be able to go through

169
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:39,540
the lens.
Since we have a totally symmetric situation,

170
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:47,380
we have a cylindrical symmetry
and this angle here, is the Einstein radius

171
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,730
θe.
That means that the image of the source,

172
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:55,300
seen from Earth, when we have a situation
where β = 0

173
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,190
so where all objects are aligned, the lens
equation has

174
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:04,610
an infinity of solutions which are distributed
over a circle

175
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:10,600
with a diameter 2θe
and so the source has an image taking the

176
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,060
shape of an annulus
around the lens galaxy.

177
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:19,990
As an example, here is a real object which
is precisely in that case.

178
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:26,540
The mass indicated here, M, is the Mass within
Einstein's radius.

179
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:30,440
So we see immediately that in this particular
configuration,

180
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:36,089
one can measure the mass of a lens galaxy
included in the Einstein radius

181
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:39,870
which is materialised by a circle; the latter
is the shape taken by an object

182
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,710
affected by the lens effect in case of perfect
alignment

183
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:48,350
between source, lens and observer.
It turns out that θe, is also a characteristic

184
00:16:48,350 --> 00:16:51,120
quantity
that gives an idea of the separation between

185
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,960
the images of a source
in a gravitational mirage, even if β is not

186
00:16:54,960 --> 00:17:01,210
exactly zero.
Now let's consider again the lens equation

187
00:17:01,210 --> 00:17:05,100
and look at a simple case where we can solve
it.

188
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:12,260
So we have β = θ - α(θ).
We see that α(θ), if we look at the previous

189
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:18,299
slide,
can also be expressed like this as a function

190
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:23,110
of θe.
I said that θe is a characteristic quantity

191
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:26,579
of lenses.
One can simply rewrite the lens equation in

192
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:34,840
a different way
so that here one will have : β = θ - (θe)²/θ.

193
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:41,749
Here, we are solving it in one dimension.
One could of course have 2-dimensional angles.

194
00:17:41,749 --> 00:17:46,309
For example in x and y, if we want to thoroughly
represent everything.

195
00:17:46,309 --> 00:17:52,169
Anyhow, for a point mass lens,
we have cylindrical symmetry even spherical.

196
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:54,279
So the choice of coordinates does not matter
much .

197
00:17:54,279 --> 00:18:02,770
Now this is equivalent to a second degree
equation in θ.

198
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:06,299
If we solve this equation here, we will get
a discriminant which reads

199
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:14,940
β² - 4 θ² * (θe)².
So β² +4(θe)²

200
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:21,460
this is a positive quantity, so we have two
solutions and the solutions --

201
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:36,580
We will call them + and - and they will be
equal to 1/2 (β ± √(β²+4θe²))

202
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:44,080
So now, we can also divide everything by θe
to have everythin in θe units.

203
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:47,110
since we said that it was a characteristic
quantity of lenses,

204
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:50,169
so we have the angles as a function of the
Einstein radius.

205
00:18:50,169 --> 00:18:58,649
There, one has 1/2 (β ± √(β²+4θe))
we are not forced to do that, but it is common

206
00:18:58,649 --> 00:19:05,640
practice.
So now this, I can call it d. We will write

207
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:15,850
d± for the signs here.
That is a displacement vector which will be

208
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:19,610
slightly bigger than this one here.
What does that mean? It means that if I have

209
00:19:19,610 --> 00:19:22,980
a lens somewhere in the sky,
and I have the Einstein radius which is like

210
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:28,320
that...
Here I show the Einstein radius, that does

211
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:31,470
not mean that the source
takes the shape of a circle, but it is the

212
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:38,610
characteristic quantity
associated with a lens of mass M.

213
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:47,410
If i place my source somewhere β/θe,
if we measure everything in arbitrary Einstein

214
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:52,100
units,
so if I take an arbitrary β, it will be β/θe,

215
00:19:52,100 --> 00:20:01,259
which can be found again here.
If I add d+ to this quantity here.

216
00:20:01,259 --> 00:20:08,549
I will have a mirror image that will form
here,

217
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:20,080
this is d+, that will be the θ+ image,
θ+/θe since we measure everything as a function

218
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,840
of the Einstein radius
and then, so my source is here, I will write

219
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,549
a quantity d-.
equal to the norm in the other direction,

220
00:20:27,549 --> 00:20:30,580
so on the other side,
so I will get somewhere around here, I have

221
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:35,919
d-.
This will be the second mirage image of the

222
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:43,679
source, that I will call θ-.
So we see here that in the case of lenses,

223
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:49,590
we have a point lens,
which means that the whole mass is concentrated

224
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,600
in one point.
M is constant as a function of the radius

225
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,739
θ.
If the lens is a point-mass, we'll have two

226
00:20:57,739 --> 00:21:01,070
mirage images
on either side of the source.

227
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:05,039
So, these are the two mirage images of the
source

228
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:09,950
which was here originally,
and this is where was the object that is the

229
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:18,360
lens.
As we have just seen, photons can be deflected

230
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:22,369
by gravitational fields.
So on this figure we see

231
00:21:22,369 --> 00:21:28,190
a gravitational lens effect on a distant quasar,
the very bright bright nucleus of a distant

232
00:21:28,190 --> 00:21:32,559
galaxy,
hosting a supermassive black hole.

233
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:39,120
When light rays from the quasar pass
near the lens galaxy, the foreground galaxy,

234
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:44,669
they are deflected, and the image of the background
object - the quasar - is modified.

235
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:48,440
We have seen in the previous slides that in
the simple case

236
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,220
of a point-mass lens, we predicted two mirage
images

237
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:56,340
of the background object, the quasar in this
instance.

238
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:59,850
But actually, when the models are a bit more
realistic, we predict

239
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:02,899
that we always get an odd number of images,
3 or 5

240
00:22:02,899 --> 00:22:08,259
depending on the shape of the foreground lens.
In the animation shown here, one sees in fact

241
00:22:08,259 --> 00:22:14,629
4 images of the quasar,
the fifth image lying between the 4 images

242
00:22:14,629 --> 00:22:20,049
distributed around the lens galaxy;
and the lens galaxy, because of its brightness,

243
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:25,340
masks the fifth image.
So we talked earlier about Einstein's rings

244
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:28,360
we have just seen in the video, in the previous
animation,

245
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:33,539
4 mirage images of a quasar.
Now what happens if instead of a point like

246
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:36,720
source,
the latter is slightly extended

247
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,590
and if the source is perfectly aligned with
the lens?

248
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:45,740
We obtain in that case of a situation like
this, a perfect Einstein ring.

249
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:54,950
Here is a lens galaxy with a redshift zl of
0.45.

250
00:22:54,950 --> 00:23:04,899
We have a source, the red shift of which,
zs, is equal to 2.38 in this case.

251
00:23:04,899 --> 00:23:09,179
And we see at once, here, the Einstein ring
materialize.

252
00:23:09,179 --> 00:23:12,179
I'm drawing it here in red but it is already
very well-defined

253
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:18,960
by the blue background galaxy at z=2.38 which
appears

254
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:26,059
as a very distinct Einstein ring.
What we see here is the Einstein ring.

255
00:23:26,059 --> 00:23:39,869
Now, we have said that θe = √((GM / c²)(Dls/Ds*Dl))
and 

256
00:23:39,869 --> 00:23:43,549
we have a distance ratio here.
So we have distances, and we need to convert

257
00:23:43,549 --> 00:23:48,379
the red shifts
into distances using a cosmological model.

258
00:23:48,379 --> 00:23:51,629
So if we have that equation here then we inverse
the equation

259
00:23:51,629 --> 00:23:56,139
and we deduce from it the mass inside the
Einstein ring.

260
00:23:56,139 --> 00:24:03,889
Now it's the mass inside θe but the Virial
would also give us

261
00:24:03,889 --> 00:24:07,519
the mass within a certain radius R that can
be chosen arbitrarily.

262
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:10,859
So, if we measure the velocity dispersion
of the stars

263
00:24:10,859 --> 00:24:14,970
within a certain radius R, we have seen in
the chapter about dark matter

264
00:24:14,970 --> 00:24:21,340
that mass is related to the dispersion of
the radial velocities in this way here.

265
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:26,340
This means that if we measure σr through
the Doppler effect,

266
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:34,450
in an aperture as shown here,
here we have a certain radius, a certain σr

267
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:42,239
measured by Doppler effect.
We'll have the mass within a certain radius

268
00:24:42,239 --> 00:24:47,309
and the mass inside the Einstein ring which
is here.

269
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:51,350
So we'll get two mass estimates inside different
radii

270
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:58,960
meaning we'll have access to the mass gradient.
It's extremly important to constrain the models

271
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,260
of galaxy formation that are produced through
numerical simulation.

272
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:11,269
The mass gradient measurment is possible partly
through this gravitational lens effect combined

273
00:25:11,269 --> 00:25:15,200
with the velocity dispersion in well chosen
apertures.

274
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,370
We already see that the strong gravitational
lens effect,

275
00:25:18,370 --> 00:25:24,169
strong because it produces large mirage images
of background objects;

276
00:25:24,169 --> 00:25:28,529
we see that the gravitational lens effect
is an extremely powerful tool to measure mass

277
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:31,850
as a function of radius
and we can measure the luminous mass and the

278
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:37,989
total mass thanks to this phenomenon
of gravitational lensing, since it only depends

279
00:25:37,989 --> 00:25:41,109
on gravitation.
We do not need to see the mass to measure

280
00:25:41,109 --> 00:25:46,890
the effect it has
on background objects.

281
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,519
Last example, there are in fact multiple applications
of the gravitational lens effect, we will

282
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:54,821
not describe them all here.
We have seen the strong gravitational lens

283
00:25:54,821 --> 00:25:57,350
effect,
which produces multiple images of background

284
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,669
objects,
namely Einstein rings.

285
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:02,129
Now we'll see the weak gravitational lens
effect.

286
00:26:02,129 --> 00:26:09,009
it's an effect which causes weak deformations
of background objects, but it is also present

287
00:26:09,009 --> 00:26:12,150
everywhere in the Universe.
Here we see a slice of the Universe, it's

288
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:16,519
a numerical simulation.
We see different slices of the Universe at

289
00:26:16,519 --> 00:26:22,359
different red shifts.
We see evolving structures.

290
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:27,299
We have a red shift of 0,
this is the present epoch.

291
00:26:27,299 --> 00:26:30,429
Here we have a red shift, it's a numerical
simulation.

292
00:26:30,429 --> 00:26:34,090
In the numerical simulation, the red shift
was of 1.4.

293
00:26:34,090 --> 00:26:41,600
And here we have a red shift of 5.7.
Now if we take some light rays

294
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:46,649
coming from far away.
The light rays will intercept each plane.

295
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:53,230
We'll have a deviation of light
which arrives for example here in this plane

296
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:56,049
here.
It will be deflected again by a mass lying,

297
00:26:56,049 --> 00:26:59,340
for example, here.
It will arrive at the plane, around the present

298
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:03,009
epoch.
If we have the image of a background object

299
00:27:03,009 --> 00:27:07,639
here, for instance,
we'll see its distorted image by lens effect

300
00:27:07,639 --> 00:27:13,559
and we'll see it
distorted at its arrival, hence at the present

301
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:17,980
time
where we observe the background source.

302
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:21,460
So this effect is very weak, we need to measure
it on a lot of galaxies

303
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,649
and take an average to see it, but it is something
detectable.

304
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:28,160
Of course the effect will change as a function
of what we put

305
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:33,090
in the different slices of the universe.
The deformations predicted by the cosmological

306
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:39,429
models
will change as a function of H0,

307
00:27:39,429 --> 00:27:44,279
of the composition of the Universe, of the
composition

308
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:50,409
in terms of dark energy and dark matter.
We will not have the same predicted universe

309
00:27:50,409 --> 00:27:55,279
and so will not predict the same deformation.
The point here, the goal will be to measure

310
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:59,500
the distortions of these
extremely distant galaxies, using this mirage

311
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:03,249
effect, which is weak.
We of course exaggerated the light deviations

312
00:28:03,249 --> 00:28:06,239
to be able to constrain
the cosmological models.

313
00:28:06,239 --> 00:28:10,559
In practice, how will we proceed?
We take a slice of the present universe.

314
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:15,399
This is a simulation, in practice we do not
see the simulated filaments.

315
00:28:15,399 --> 00:28:20,000
Actually, the galaxy clusters, here we have
gigantic scales,

316
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:23,559
the galaxy clusters can be found at the connections
between the filaments.

317
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,700
But filaments are essentialy composed of weakly
luminous matter

318
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:35,739
and dark matter.
Now, assuming that the background galaxies

319
00:28:35,739 --> 00:28:41,950
are round like this.
I'm placing them like this.

320
00:28:41,950 --> 00:28:45,629
They are of course billions, I only have a
few.

321
00:28:45,629 --> 00:28:49,210
Some of them are near each other,
others are far away from each other;

322
00:28:49,210 --> 00:28:51,989
each time the rays are deflected, what will
happen is

323
00:28:51,989 --> 00:29:01,749
that a circular galaxy will be distorted
into a small ellipse by the lens effect.

324
00:29:01,749 --> 00:29:06,869
The distortion will be tangential with respect
to the direction of the mass.

325
00:29:06,869 --> 00:29:13,389
A round galaxy,
and some mass here,

326
00:29:13,389 --> 00:29:18,769
it will be distorted by lensing effect,
I'm exaggerating the deformation a lot but

327
00:29:18,769 --> 00:29:21,460
in this manner
Here, if we have a massive filament going

328
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:24,710
through here,
the distortion will be like this.

329
00:29:24,710 --> 00:29:29,360
Here the distortion will be like this.
We can draw a lot of others, I cannot show

330
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,279
them all.
But here for example, we have several galaxies

331
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,510
distorted
by approximately the same filaments.

332
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:42,010
Here, there is another like this.
We can see that the shapes of galaxies which

333
00:29:42,010 --> 00:29:47,940
are affected by the same filament,
will obviously be more correlated than galaxies

334
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:53,720
distorted
by filaments lying very far away, angularly

335
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:57,279
on the sky.
So here, between two galaxies, we have an

336
00:29:57,279 --> 00:30:03,639
angle θ, there another angle θ,
what we'll be able to measure in practice

337
00:30:03,639 --> 00:30:07,830
is what we call
the 2-points correlation function of the shapes

338
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:11,440
of the galaxies.
This correlation function, we'll omit the

339
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:16,979
details here,
we'll call it ζ(θ).

340
00:30:16,979 --> 00:30:20,950
We have here the θ angle, the typical scales
are 10 arcminutes

341
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:26,570
to 100 arc minutes on the sky,
hence the importance of taking wide field

342
00:30:26,570 --> 00:30:28,920
images.
We want to measure the correlation function

343
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:33,119
over very large scales;
so for small angles, we look at the correlation

344
00:30:33,119 --> 00:30:37,519
of the shapes of galaxies which are separated
by a certain angle θ.

345
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:42,809
Then, of course, the galaxies that lie close
to each other feel a lens effect

346
00:30:42,809 --> 00:30:46,710
due to the same filaments, so the correlation
is very strong.

347
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,479
Galaxies lying far away from each other, hence
at high θ, will be

348
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:54,090
much less correlated.
What we expect to see is a correlation function

349
00:30:54,090 --> 00:30:58,059
that will decrease like this.
The goal is to measure the distortions of

350
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:01,850
all galaxies over the whole sky
and to measure the shapes of all galaxies

351
00:31:01,850 --> 00:31:05,570
over the whole sky
and to measure the correlations at every scale.

352
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:09,490
The idea is to take the most precise measurement
points, here,

353
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,239
to discriminate between the different curves,
the different correlation functions

354
00:31:13,239 --> 00:31:16,710
here, which are predicted by the cosmological
models.

355
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:20,779
The cosmological models will predict a correlation
function

356
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:25,759
or a power spectrum which will be a function
of θ of course,

357
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:33,539
of H0, and then of cosmology.
Cosmology is, among other things, H0,

358
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,499
but also the densities of the different components
of the universe

359
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:40,870
namely dark matter, dark energy.
Thanks to these measurements of weak gravitational

360
00:31:40,870 --> 00:31:43,450
lensing
and of the correlation function of galaxy

361
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,340
shapes
everywhere in the universe,

362
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:50,279
we can constrain cosmological models, provided
we have, as far

363
00:31:50,279 --> 00:31:56,999
as possible, a map of the whole sky with a
very high spatial resolution.

364
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,869
The gravitational lens effect manifests itself
at all mass scales

365
00:32:00,869 --> 00:32:04,950
and at all spatial scales :
from stellar scales or even planetary ones,

366
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:10,220
to galaxies or even galaxy clusters.
We have even seen that the largest structures

367
00:32:10,220 --> 00:32:13,600
in the universe,
the cosmic filaments, produce a weak but measurable

368
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,599
lensing effect
and that these measurements allow us to determine

369
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:21,419
the cosmological parameters,
the parameters which describe how the universe

370
00:32:21,419 --> 00:32:25,429
is evolving
and what its composition is.

371
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:30,890
The data, for this ambitious goal, will be
produced by the Euclid satellite of ESA

372
00:32:30,890 --> 00:32:34,999
which, starting from 2020, will measure, with
exceptional quality,

373
00:32:34,999 --> 00:32:38,470
the shapes of billions of galaxies to see
statistically

374
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:42,639
how the images are distorted by the whole
of the cosmic structures

375
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:47,820
over a field of view which corresponds to
a third of the whole sky.

376
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:54,440
So for now the future of cosmology depends
on our ability to map the whole universe and

377
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:58,389
not
just some well targeted areas as we were able

378
00:32:58,389 --> 00:33:01,580
to make until now.
This concludes this week of lectures

379
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:08,080
and our MOOC of introduction to astrophysics.
We have introduced a large variety of topics

380
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:12,690
and described physical concepts
hiding behind astronomical observations and

381
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:16,840
their interpretations.
The goal has been to understand the principles,

382
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,379
rather than
the detailed mathematical developments.

383
00:33:19,379 --> 00:33:24,269
I hope this goal has been achieved.
But I especially hope that you took as much

384
00:33:24,269 --> 00:33:27,149
pleasure
in following this course as we had preparing

385
00:33:27,149 --> 00:33:27,349
it.
