1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:09,670
The Doppler-Fizeau is one of the most invaluable
tools in astrophysics.

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:12,910
It allows a direct measurement of the velocity
of stellar objects

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:17,881
and so enables the study of their movement.
When used along with the Viriel theorem or

4
00:00:17,881 --> 00:00:22,910
the Kepler's laws,
both bringing in the velocities,

5
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:27,679
it also allows indirect measurement of the
masses of celestial bodies.

6
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:30,499
It concerns the effect of the combination
of velocities

7
00:00:30,499 --> 00:00:36,410
when a source moves with respect to the observer.
The wavelength of the emitted wave, it may

8
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,080
be sound or light,
decreases if the source moves toward the observer,

9
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,640
and thus we observe blueshift.
The wavelength increases if the source moves

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,110
away from the observer,
in this case redshift is observed.

11
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,460
One can see here a moving light source
and a representation of the perception of

12
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:03,370
wavelength by the observer.
When the source moves forward, the wavelength

13
00:01:03,370 --> 00:01:07,190
is compressed
and the light seen by the observer is bluer.

14
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:11,970
While moving in the opposite direction,
the wavelength increases and so it is seen

15
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,670
redder,
redshift is observed.

16
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:19,740
How does the Doppler effect work?
Considering at first a source at rest.

17
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,630
It was just said that the Doppler effect is
due to the combination of movements,

18
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:28,950
the combination of velocities,
so the velocity of wavelength propagation

19
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,479
and the velocity of the emitting source.
Here we have a source at rest emitting a spherical

20
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:38,880
wave
with some speed c

21
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,479
and wavelength lambda zero (λ0).
λ0 is shown here,

22
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,990
so wavelength is the pulsation of the wave.
In the case of the light, the velocity is

23
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:57,710
equal to c.
Now, what is happening when the source moves?

24
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:00,970
Here we have a wavefront that was emitted
at the time

25
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:05,450
when the source was in this place.
The source will continue to emit the wavefronts

26
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:11,009
while moving forward.
While this wavefront was emitted,

27
00:02:11,009 --> 00:02:18,379
this one was propagating, and so on.
Here we arrive at a situation

28
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:22,480
in which the wavefronts were emitted in the
same way as when the source was at rest

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,969
but are combined with the velocity of the
source.

30
00:02:25,969 --> 00:02:33,730
It can be noticed that the wavefronts are
closer to each other toward the observer

31
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:36,340
and further from each other in the opposite
direction.

32
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:42,829
How does it work?
Here the wavelengths will appear bluer

33
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,719
and here redder.
Now, let's draw the axis representing the

34
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:55,249
direction of the observer
and the source with some velocity v.

35
00:02:55,249 --> 00:03:03,020
Then, the source emits the wavefronts
so we can draw one here and another one over

36
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:08,250
here.
Wavelength emitted by the source at rest,

37
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:17,730
will be called λ0.
Now we consider Δt,

38
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:22,329
the time interval between two wavefronts seen
by the observer.

39
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:28,220
What will be this time interval?
Obviously, if the source is at rest Δt is

40
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,809
equal to Δt0,
which is also the period of the wave.

41
00:03:31,809 --> 00:03:36,499
We can say that Δt0 is the period of the
wave,

42
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:41,340
the period of the wave at rest.
The relation between those two time intervals

43
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:48,129
is Δt = Δt0 if nothing moves.
But if the source is not at rest, during the

44
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:56,309
time Δt0
it will move a given distance Δx

45
00:03:56,309 --> 00:04:01,370
continuously emitting wavefronts.
Finally, the time separating two wavefronts

46
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:08,309
seen by the observer
will be equal to Δt0 minus another time interval

47
00:04:08,309 --> 00:04:12,730
that is equal to the time needed for the source
to move with the velocity v

48
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:20,750
a distance Δx that is shown here.
Of course, the velocity of the wave is c.

49
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:32,020
Now, one just has to rewrite Δx as vΔt0
which is the distance the source moved during

50
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,680
the time that separates
two wavefronts at rest with the velocity v.

51
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:42,270
Obviously, it is divided by c
as the wave is propagating with the speed

52
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:45,819
of light
in the case of the electromagnetic waves.

53
00:04:45,819 --> 00:04:56,500
We also have that λ= cΔt,
so it suffices to divide the whole expression

54
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,720
by c
to obtain that λ , the wavelength seen by

55
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:08,870
the observer,
is λ minus v/c λ0.

56
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:13,150
This is the expression for the Doppler effect
that combines the wavelength in the reference

57
00:05:13,150 --> 00:05:16,879
frame of the source,
so, what the source sees while emitting the

58
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:19,659
wave,
and the wavelength seen by the observer.

59
00:05:19,659 --> 00:05:24,860
Here the case of the source moving toward
the observer was presented,

60
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,560
but if the source moves away, the sign changes
here for +,

61
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,740
so we would be in the situation where
the wave propagates in a direction opposite

62
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,789
to the observer.
The expression for the Doppler effect can

63
00:05:37,789 --> 00:05:42,009
be written in several different ways.
In the previous slide it was written in this

64
00:05:42,009 --> 00:05:47,139
way.
The minus sign is due to the fact that,

65
00:05:47,139 --> 00:05:52,870
as was seen in the figure which was just drawn,
the source moves toward the observer.

66
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:56,370
The plus sign appears if the source moves
away from the observer.

67
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,129
It should be noted that
the sources do not always

68
00:05:59,129 --> 00:06:02,379
move in the same direction as the line of
sight to the observer.

69
00:06:02,379 --> 00:06:08,530
Let say the observer is in this place.
In one situation the source can go in the

70
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:13,310
direction of the observer,
but there can also be the case in which the

71
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,870
source moves in the other direction.
Let this be the velocity vector, the angle

72
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,169
θ is the angle
between the line connecting the source with

73
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:24,960
the observer and the velocity vector.
What counts in this case

74
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,280
is the velocity of the source along the line
of sight -

75
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:33,270
the velocity that is projected on the line
of sight.

76
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:37,139
So in fact the full expression for the Doppler
effect

77
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:45,940
Is Δλ/λ, or λ -λ0/λ0,
equals minus v over c times the cosine of

78
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,550
the angle between the velocity vector
and the line of sight connecting the source

79
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:54,319
to the observer.
Clearly, θ takes the values in the range

80
00:06:54,319 --> 00:07:03,949
from 0 to π.
The redshift is often written as z

81
00:07:03,949 --> 00:07:14,219
The redshift is often written as z
and relates for example to the cosmological

82
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:18,470
redshift.
The expression for the Doppler effect can

83
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:26,199
be written in more compact way
as λ = λ0 times (1 + z).

84
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:29,889
If the velocity or the redshift of the source
is known,

85
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:35,569
one can relate the observed wavelengths
to the wavelengths emitted by the source

86
00:07:35,569 --> 00:07:39,509
as if it was at rest.
We have already defined the redshift,

87
00:07:39,509 --> 00:07:41,919
but how in practice the redshift is measured
?

88
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:46,180
or the blueshift is measured ?
Speaking of colours,

89
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:49,490
one can see here an example of the spectrum,
the image of a star

90
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:54,930
as seen with a telescope.
The image, instead of being directly recorded

91
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:58,099
with the CCD camera
or another detector,

92
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:02,199
is divided into many parts from which one
is selected.

93
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,490
In fact, in focal plane of the telescope
a mask is placed

94
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:15,199
in the shape of the slit, as shown here.
The image if the slit can be observed with

95
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:18,629
a prism
or a diffraction grating.

96
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:23,000
In this way the image of the slit
can be observed over the whole range of wavelengths.

97
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,919
So the spectrograph works in such a way
that the image is formed in the focal plane

98
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:29,949
of the telescope,
then a part of this image is selected.

99
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:33,610
Here the star is seen as a point
so the light is dispersed from the blue to

100
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:36,580
the red part of the spectrum, as illustrated
in the figure.

101
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:40,210
If the observed object was an extended light
source, there would be a spectrum like this

102
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:42,140
one
at all the points of the slit.

103
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:46,530
So what the spectrograph does
is to create an image of the slit at all wavelengths.

104
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:53,580
Here we would have the slit seen in green
light,

105
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:57,630
and in this place the image of the slit can
be drawn

106
00:08:57,630 --> 00:09:02,450
at the wavelengths toward the red part of
the spectrum.

107
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,290
The idea behind this is to create the image
of the slit

108
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:09,620
at all wavelengths.
The slit is placed here, the image of the

109
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,660
slit is created.
The spectrum is the combination of the successive

110
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,480
images of the slit.
Once we have the spectrum,

111
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:24,880
how the redshift can be measured in practise?
As an example we show a nebula

112
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:30,650
or a gas cloud emitting emission lines.
This gas cloud moves for example in the direction

113
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:39,540
of the observer
that is placed here.

114
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:45,090
In this situation the cloud has some velocity
towards the line of sight to the observer,

115
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:52,070
let it be the velocity v.
In this case a blueshift is expected to occur.

116
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:59,540
Let’s draw the spectrum of this object.
We place

117
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:05,370
two axes
and draw a simple spectrum

118
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:10,650
that is just an emission line.
On the y axis we have the flux Fλ, and the

119
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:15,120
x-axis corresponds to the wavelength.
If we consider this simple spectrum composed

120
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,990
of one emission line,
for example the hydrogen line Hα at 6565

121
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:26,770
ångström (Å),
what will happen to this line ?

122
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:32,080
In this case we have a blueshift
so the line shifted toward the blue will be

123
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:40,570
seen here
and in this case

124
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:48,880
the wavelength of the line
will be λ =λ0 times 1 minus v/c.

125
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,200
Conversely,
if the velocity vector is in the opposite

126
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,690
direction,
so, when the source moves away from the observer,

127
00:10:58,690 --> 00:11:03,310
then we observe a red shift
and the spectrum shifts toward red

128
00:11:03,310 --> 00:11:09,320
and will be seen in this way.
The redshifted line will have the wavelength

129
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:16,810
of λ= λ0 times 1 plus v / c.
So in this case the cloud moves toward the

130
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:20,940
observer.
If the cloud moves

131
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:24,600
in a different direction than along the line
of sight to the observer,

132
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,100
we can choose for example this direction,
one has to multiply the velocity v by the

133
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:35,930
cosine of the angle θ.
We have just seen an example of a cloud

134
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:42,190
emitting a line, in our case the line Hα.
Now, we can look at the situation in which

135
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,890
there is an absorption line.
Obviously, Doppler effect applies also in

136
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:47,480
this case.
Here we have a star

137
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:59,430
whose spectrum is that of the black body.
The light of the star passes through the cloud

138
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:09,690
composed of cold gas
and propagates toward the observer.

139
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:14,970
The cloud of cold gas
contains atoms, for example hydrogen

140
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:20,430
but it can also include other atoms.
We can have for example the line Hα that

141
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:24,980
we have just seen
with the wavelength 6565 ångström (Å),

142
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:30,420
so the optical line,
or a line of the Lyman series - Lyman α,

143
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:35,970
at 1216 ångström (Å).
We have the situation in which there is a

144
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:41,070
cloud of cold gas
that absorbs light, creating an absorption

145
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:44,710
spectrum
seen superposed with the spectrum of the star.

146
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:47,270
Firstly, we draw the velocity vector of the
cloud

147
00:12:47,270 --> 00:13:00,380
and the spectrum,
as before the y axis corresponds to Fλ, x

148
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:04,730
axis to λ.
We could also have Fν, ν

149
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,300
if we would like to present the spectrum in
a different way.

150
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,180
This is the curve representing the black body
spectrum,

151
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:13,990
the Planck spectrum,
as an example it could be the spectrum of

152
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:19,170
the Sun at 5780 K.
What will be observed depends on the velocity

153
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:24,450
of the cloud:
if the cloud is at rest, an absorption line,

154
00:13:24,450 --> 00:13:31,120
for example the line Hα,
will be observed

155
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:42,170
at λ equal to λ0 =6565 ångström, as v
= 0.

156
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:46,260
If the cloud moves toward the observer
the line will be blueshifted

157
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:51,390
and the same absorption line
will be observed but toward the blue part

158
00:13:51,390 --> 00:13:59,900
of the spectrum.
In this case λ = λ0 (1- v/c).

159
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,840
As we have seen, the Doppler effect
applies for the emission lines, as well as

160
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:08,610
for the absorption lines.
Now we will see in details how the Doppler

161
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:12,380
effect can be used.
As an example we take the case of the rotation

162
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:20,720
of the Sun or of the stars in general.
We draw the rotation axis of the Sun

163
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:28,100
and the solar equator.
Then, we can take the solar spectrum

164
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:34,290
by placing the slit in this way
in order to select a piece of the Sun.

165
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:42,410
Here, the slit is drawn quite large on purpose.
In this position, at the border of the Sun,

166
00:14:42,410 --> 00:14:45,310
the velocity vector is directed toward the
observer,

167
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,760
it will be at position 1.
On the equator,

168
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:56,190
the velocity vector is tangential,
this will be position 3.

169
00:14:56,190 --> 00:15:00,760
In this place the velocity vector has the
opposite direction than at position 1,

170
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,300
it can be called position 2.
It was said that the spectrum is the image

171
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,420
of the slit
at different wavelengths.

172
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:11,670
We will represent it in this image; drawing
the slit

173
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:16,610
thicker than before
and selecting a line that would be

174
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:24,180
in the green part of the spectrum.
Then we will look at the points 1, 2 and 3

175
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,250
on the slit.
The point 3 is in this place, the point 1

176
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:37,420
in the upper part, and the point 2 is here.
We can see that the point 2 is moving away

177
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:41,930
from us
so the point that is in this place will be

178
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:46,940
redshifted.
The velocity at point 3

179
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:52,290
does not have a radial component
so this point stays in the same place

180
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:58,090
its wavelength being equal to λ =λ0.
Point 1 is moving in our direction

181
00:15:58,090 --> 00:16:05,110
so it will be blueshifted.
One can imagine

182
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:10,470
the series of points for which the redshift
will be measured.

183
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:17,630
There are different velocities
so in this place the points are blueshifted.

184
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:20,450
In this way, a new image of the slit can be
seen

185
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:32,450
when all the points are shifted in such manner.
If the wavelength at rest

186
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:37,740
is equal to λ0,
once shifted, all the wavelengths λ0 will

187
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:40,170
be placed
on the new image of the slit.

188
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:43,510
Consequently, all the emission or absorption
lines of the Sun

189
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:47,660
will be seen inclined in the spectrum.
Obviously, if the star was rotating in the

190
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:50,570
other direction
the new image of the slit would be tilted

191
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:54,380
also in the opposite direction.
Now let's look at an important application

192
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:58,740
in astrophysics,
namely the search of the exoplanets using

193
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:03,150
the measurement of the radial velocities
of the stars that host a planetary system

194
00:17:03,150 --> 00:17:08,740
outside the Solar system.
It is not an easy task

195
00:17:08,740 --> 00:17:13,600
because the distance between a star and a
planet

196
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,620
is small,
and the luminosity contrast between those

197
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:21,890
two is generally
very high.

198
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,980
The contrasts can reach tens of magnitude,
in some cases even more.

199
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:32,680
So it is difficult to directly detect
an exoplanet with direct imaging

200
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:38,950
around the host star.
Let's see what happens when the planet rotates

201
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:46,800
about
the centre of mass of the star-planet system.

202
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:52,920
Representing a few positions
during the planet's rotation,

203
00:17:52,920 --> 00:17:58,680
and drawing what is happening at each position;
Here is the star and

204
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:05,920
its planet are at position 1.
In this place we mark the centre of gravity

205
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:11,570
of those two objects,
here position 2 of the star and the corresponding

206
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:22,090
position of the planet.
At position 3 the planet is here,

207
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:29,880
while for position 4 here.
Of course each time the velocity vector

208
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:43,000
at positions 1, 2, 3 and 4
is equal to vmax.

209
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:47,840
One has to pay attention, to the fact that
the velocity is equal to vmax times sinus

210
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,360
i,
which is measurable with spectroscopic measurements,

211
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:53,120
on account of the inclination of the planetary
orbit

212
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:59,490
with regard to the plane of the sky.
This is the direction to the observer.

213
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:04,790
When the spectrum of the system is available
it is only the star that is visible

214
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,250
and not the planet.
Those are the oscillations of the star's velocity

215
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:12,860
that will be detected
around the centre of mass of the star-planet

216
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,980
system.
Let's draw this situation.

217
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:18,790
The important data can be obtained from the
star's spectra

218
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:30,320
taken at regular intervals.
The velocity will be presented on the y axis,

219
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:36,360
so v sin i, as a function of time.
This curve is called the velocity curve.

220
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:40,680
Obviously, the stars in the Galaxy have some
velocity

221
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:43,270
so we need to centre the axis on the mean
velocity

222
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:51,320
of our star in the Galaxy.
This velocity is typically equal to some tens

223
00:19:51,320 --> 00:19:54,730
or hundreds of km/s.
The mean velocity

224
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:59,240
can be represented
in this way

225
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:03,130
with an arbitrary direction.
This vector represents the mean velocity of

226
00:20:03,130 --> 00:20:06,390
the star in the Galaxy,
so the velocity of the centre of mass of the

227
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:10,230
system.
The star rotates about the centre of mass,

228
00:20:10,230 --> 00:20:16,450
and we can put the data coming from the different
positions on the diagram.

229
00:20:16,450 --> 00:20:23,580
Starting with position 1:
if the observer is here,

230
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:30,461
there is no radial component of the velocity
and no change observed with respect to the

231
00:20:30,461 --> 00:20:34,559
mean velocity.
On the contrary, for position 2

232
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,910
the velocity vector is radial with respect
to the observer,

233
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:42,250
and a point corresponding to this position
can be placed here.

234
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:47,420
This velocity is equal to v mean +v max sin
i .

235
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:52,250
Position 3 corresponds to position 1,
with the difference that this point is obtained

236
00:20:52,250 --> 00:20:55,650
further in time.
As before, the velocity is equal to the mean

237
00:20:55,650 --> 00:20:58,940
velocity because of the lack of the radial
component.

238
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:03,490
Position 4 is similar to position 2
but the velocity vector has the opposite direction

239
00:21:03,490 --> 00:21:06,690
so on the diagram the point should be placed
on the other side.

240
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:13,870
The velocity in this case is equal to v mean
minus v max times the sine of the inclination.

241
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:21,110
By connecting the points
we obtain the velocity curve

242
00:21:21,110 --> 00:21:26,850
which is obviously periodic.
So what we can measure directly is the rotation

243
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:34,850
period
of the star around the centre of gravity

244
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:38,770
which is equal to the rotation period of the
planet around the centre of gravity,

245
00:21:38,770 --> 00:21:41,550
as we are in the frame of the centre of mass
of the system.

246
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:45,070
That kind of curve, the velocity curve of
a star, suffices

247
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:49,840
to deduce the period of rotation of the planet
and the maximal velocity of the star rotating

248
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:55,120
around the gravity centre.
This was another important application of

249
00:21:55,120 --> 00:22:00,060
the Doppler effect.
At last, the Hubble law, so we do now a drastic

250
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:04,090
change in spatial scales
and enter into the domain of cosmology.

251
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:10,040
As the Universe expands,
the distances between the galaxies,

252
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:14,460
schematically presented in the figure,
will increase with time.

253
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:19,930
Because of this expansion
so, after some time the galaxies have moved

254
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:25,130
away from each other.
The metric expanded

255
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:28,610
and all the arrows drawn here on the image
become larger.

256
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:32,530
Due to the increased distances,
if the observer was placed in one of those

257
00:22:32,530 --> 00:22:35,530
galaxies
he/she would observe the other galaxies moving

258
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:40,840
away.
The Hubble law

259
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,380
relates the velocity of galaxies that move
away,

260
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:47,910
this velocity being completely radial
with respect to the line of sight to each

261
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:51,260
galaxy.
so the velocity of these galaxies is proportional

262
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:56,030
to the distance between the galaxies.
These velocities of the galaxies are measured

263
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:59,730
using the Doppler effect,
the distance, as it will be seen later, is

264
00:22:59,730 --> 00:23:03,860
measured with the distance modulus.
Then, the proportionality constant can be

265
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,610
deduced.
As we have seen during this lecture,

266
00:23:08,610 --> 00:23:12,480
the Doppler-Fizeau effect has lots of applications
in astrophysics:

267
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:16,870
from the search for exoplanets using velocity
curves

268
00:23:16,870 --> 00:23:23,460
of stars hosting planets,
to the rotation of stars

269
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:26,450
and to the measurement of the temperature
of the interstellar medium,

270
00:23:26,450 --> 00:23:29,040
or to the measure of the rate of expansion
of the Universe

271
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:34,010
using the recessional velocity of galaxies.
We will get back many times to the Doppler

272
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:37,140
effect during this course.
It is worth mentioning that

273
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:41,430
each time a theoretical model, an idea or
a concept predicts velocities,

274
00:23:41,430 --> 00:23:45,059
the practical way of measuring them will be
by using the Doppler effect.
