1
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,420
Tidal forces play a role in the formation
and destruction of stars.

2
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,129
They are present in all spatial scales:
in planets, comets,

3
00:00:14,129 --> 00:00:19,550
stars and stellar clusters.
It is known that tidal forces can deform objects

4
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:22,360
as large
as galaxies.

5
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:25,849
We are familiar with the tidal forces on the
Earth

6
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:32,090
through the periodic motion of the oceans:
the tides, which gave their name to this force.

7
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:35,300
There are some dramatic manifestations of
the forces

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:42,550
in places such as the Breton site Mont Saint-Michel,
or when they cause the tidal bore

9
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:46,430
to the delight of surfers.
In this lecture, the origins of the tidal

10
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:50,649
forces will be described
along with some illustrations of their manifestation

11
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:54,199
on Earth,
but also elsewhere in the Solar System and

12
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:58,670
in the Universe.
How do the tidal forces work?

13
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:01,699
It is a differential acceleration at ground
level.

14
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:07,910
A differential acceleration due to the Moon
experienced at ground level.

15
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:12,729
We will seek how the Moon's gravitational
force

16
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:16,230
varies at the ground level with respect to
another point,

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:23,800
this reference point being the centre of the
Earth.

18
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:28,670
In order to illustrate the situation,
let's consider the Earth, and the Moon with

19
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:37,549
a mass m.
The moon is at the distance d from the Earth,

20
00:01:37,549 --> 00:01:43,899
r is the radius of the Earth.
Let's calculate the tidal forces

21
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:49,060
at two different points on the Earth.
The observer is placed on the Moon's orbital

22
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:59,930
plane.
The arrow points in the direction

23
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:05,000
of the Moon
that has a gravitational influence on the

24
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,930
Earth.
The closer the Moon,

25
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:17,760
the stronger the gravitational field.
If the Moon is in this direction, it attracts

26
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,820
this side of the Earth
with some force, and the other side of the

27
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:25,980
Earth
with a force that is much smaller.

28
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:32,950
The centre of The Earth is attracted with
a force

29
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:38,520
that has an intermediate norm.
Three points are taken: A, B and C for the

30
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:49,090
centre of the Earth.
Now, we look for the Moon's differential gravitational

31
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:53,660
field
at a given point with regard to the same gravitational

32
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:57,140
field
at a different point.

33
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:02,010
It means that we look for the gravitational
field g

34
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:08,670
caused by the Moon at the point A minus g
caused by the Moon at C, for example.

35
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:17,110
gA - gC can be represented using vectors.
This is gA,

36
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:24,230
minus gC, that can be placed at this point
with the same norm as at point C.

37
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:30,650
Minus gC is also here,
and one can see that gC - gC is equal to zero.

38
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:33,860
It can also be represented at this point.
Now one can calculate

39
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:44,310
gA - gC and gB - gC
which is the tidal force,

40
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,430
the differential force that describes the
acceleration experienced at this point

41
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:52,180
with respect to the centre of Earth, or at
this point also with respect to the centre

42
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,140
of Earth.
Rewriting the equation using m - mass of the

43
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:02,849
Moon
gA = Gm/ (d + r)² , A is at distance d

44
00:04:02,849 --> 00:04:20,500
(Moon - Earth distance) plus r - Earth's radius,
minus gC = Gm/d².

45
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,000
Earth - Moon distance is much larger than
the Earth's radius

46
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,750
so this expression can be developed into a
Taylor series

47
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:35,410
factorising the Gm/d² term.
With some further calculations

48
00:04:35,410 --> 00:04:43,390
one soon finds - (2Gm/d³) * r.
The expression for the tidal force at A is

49
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:50,970
negative,
so the vector of this force is directed outwards,

50
00:04:50,970 --> 00:05:00,860
it can be marked in this way.
This is the tidal force at A.

51
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:07,421
The same calculations can be done for B.
It can be noticed that for gB - gC, the force

52
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:18,970
will be directed toward the Moon.
Its norm can be calculated in the same way

53
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:27,280
as before,
hence, gB - gC = Gm / (d - r)²

54
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:34,700
Before, there was a plus in this place, now
the other side of the Earth is considered.

55
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:40,660
so it is -GC / d², it stays the same.
Computing the Tylor series

56
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:53,410
gives (2Gm/d³) * r with the plus sign.
Plus means the direction toward the Moon,

57
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:56,500
minus - the opposite direction.
There are two differential forces

58
00:05:56,500 --> 00:06:04,090
that pull each side of the Earth.
Obviously, the differential force with regard

59
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,780
to C
is equal to zero.

60
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,660
To a first approximation, as the expansion
was limited to the first order,

61
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:17,730
those two forces
have the same norm but opposite directions.

62
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:21,680
The intensity of the tidal forces in the Moon's
orbital plane was shown.

63
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:26,500
Here we represent in black the Moon's orbital
plane.

64
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:31,870
This is the direction of the Moon.
Now, let's represent the Moon's gravitational

65
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:36,420
force
at different points of the globe.

66
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:42,930
One force is exerted here, a force at the
centre is weaker

67
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:48,410
because of the greater distance to the Moon,
another one is even smaller.

68
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:51,660
Obviously, the vectors are drawn larger in
order to

69
00:06:51,660 --> 00:06:57,030
illustrate better the differences.
Then, we are interested in the points lying

70
00:06:57,030 --> 00:07:02,030
on a line perpendicular
to the Moon's orbital plane,

71
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:06,500
a line like this.
One can draw the gravitational forces at those

72
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:20,880
points,
the vectors are tilted in this way.

73
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:25,500
Each arrow has several components.
If the difference between each vector at the

74
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,930
border of the Earth
and the vector at the centre is taken

75
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,300
one can find the differential forces that
were shown in the previous slide:

76
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:45,720
both directed outward with equal norm
but with opposite directions.

77
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:49,080
Those are the tidal forces in the Moon's orbital
plane.

78
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:58,970
Now, let's consider those three points.
This vector at the centre has a single component

79
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:04,750
along the Earth - Moon direction.
Those two vectors have two components.

80
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:09,000
Each of those three vectors is at the same
distance to the Moon.

81
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:18,520
Placing the x axis here and y axis there,
one can see that their x components are the

82
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,690
same,
meaning that this red vector

83
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:34,709
has the same norm as those two.
If one takes the difference between those

84
00:08:34,709 --> 00:08:39,840
two vectors,
let's say that here we have the points D and

85
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:49,210
E,
point C at the centre,

86
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:54,770
the gravitational field of the Moon at point
D minus the same at C,

87
00:08:54,770 --> 00:09:00,230
as it was shown on the previous slide,
the resulting vector has only the y component

88
00:09:00,230 --> 00:09:04,080
of the gravitational force of the Moon at
point D.

89
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:12,440
The resulting vectors
can be represented like this.

90
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:16,650
The Moon influences the Earth in such a way
that the Earth

91
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:21,330
is stretched in the Moon's orbital plane and
then "crushed"

92
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:25,100
in the direction perpendicular to the Moon's
orbital plane.

93
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:36,920
The Earth is flattened,
the tidal forces have an influence on the

94
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,190
Earth's crust,
especially on the fluids on its surface - the

95
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:50,650
sea.
The Moon is placed in this plane,

96
00:09:50,650 --> 00:09:55,490
and so the oceans are stretched on both sides
of the Earth,

97
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:01,180
they undergo the force toward the centre of
the Earth

98
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:03,810
in the direction perpendicular to the Moon's
orbital plane.

99
00:10:03,810 --> 00:10:08,180
This has a direct influence on the motions
of the oceans

100
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:15,150
around the Earth.
If the Earth-Moon system was isolated,

101
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:21,330
the tidal forces would have the directions
as indicated,

102
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,760
and obviously, the oceans would follow this
motion -

103
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:29,580
there would be two liquid lobes on the Earth's
surface.

104
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,121
The description was for the tidal forces due
to the Moon

105
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:35,870
but, obviously, the same effect is present
due to the Sun.

106
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:39,720
The intensity of the tidal forces caused by
the Sun

107
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:46,010
is weaker.
Clearly, depending on

108
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:49,240
the position of the Moon with respect to the
Earth and the Sun,

109
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:54,970
the intensity of the tides changes.
In this situation, one has what is called

110
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:59,780
neap tide
caused by the combination of the tidal forces

111
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:02,860
originating
from the Moon and the Sun, both effects being

112
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:09,120
perpendicular.
Moon rotates around the Earth in 28 days,

113
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:15,750
Earth around the Sun in 365 days.
It means that

114
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:23,750
the changes in the tidal forces caused by
the Moon are much faster

115
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:26,410
than the changes of the tidal forces caused
by the Sun.

116
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:30,600
In this situation, the combined effect of
the tidal forces caused by the Moon and the

117
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:38,200
Sun
creates spring tide.

118
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:44,490
Both lobes created by the tidal forces of
the Moon and the Sun overlap.

119
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:50,130
Once more the neap tide, and then the situation
with the full moon,

120
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:56,630
as only this side of the Moon is illuminated,
we have a spring tide once again.

121
00:11:56,630 --> 00:12:00,650
For the full moon and new moon we have spring
tides.

122
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:05,790
For the waxing and waning quarter moon
there is a neap tide.

123
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:10,260
The tidal forces influence the motions of
the oceans

124
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:17,220
which in turn influence the Earth's rotation.
Indeed, when the Moon rotates around the Earth

125
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:22,790
the oceans tend to "follow" it.
Due to the tidal forces the oceans take an

126
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:27,960
ellipsoidal shape
that follow the Moon's trajectory.

127
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:33,690
In this motion, the oceans
rub the earth's crust,

128
00:12:33,690 --> 00:12:37,400
causing the release
of energy

129
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:44,130
in the form of heat.
The Earth looses rotational energy, and so

130
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:50,680
angular momentum.
This implies that the Earth

131
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,570
slows down its rotation.
This is not the only consequence;

132
00:12:55,570 --> 00:12:59,630
while the Earth is slowing down, the Earth
- Moon distance increases.

133
00:12:59,630 --> 00:13:05,230
This effect is shown on the next slide.
Considering the Earth - Moon system as isolated,

134
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:13,240
the Earth at this place, and the Moon here.
Let r be the Earth - Moon distance,

135
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:20,260
m the mass of the Moon and ω its angular
velocity

136
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:27,700
around the Earth.
This system is isolated

137
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,980
meaning that its total angular momentum is
constant.

138
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:37,550
Due to the friction of the oceans upon the
terrestrial crust,

139
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:43,500
the Earth looses angular momentum
increasing at the same time the angular momentum

140
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:47,940
of the Moon,
as the total angular momentum is conserved.

141
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:55,779
The Moon's angular momentum
is equal to L= mωr².

142
00:13:55,779 --> 00:13:59,170
As it was said before, the angular momentum
of the Moon increases

143
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,730
so L dot is positive.
Now, it will be shown how the fact that L

144
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:11,900
dot is positive implies
that r dot is positive, meaning that the Moon

145
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,420
increases its distance from the Earth.
Let's write the angular momentum of the Moon,

146
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:22,600
its mass,
angular velocity, the square of its orbital

147
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:29,050
radius.
It was said that L dot is positive.

148
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:37,820
Let's take the time derivative of L.
Now, using Kepler's laws,

149
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:45,680
particularly the third law,
one can write that ω²r³ is equal to a constant.

150
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:54,460
Computing the time derivative
which is zero, and factorizing this expression

151
00:14:54,460 --> 00:15:09,240
leads to an ωr term here
and finally one gets 2ω dot r² + 3ωṙr

152
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:16,580
=0.
Obviously, neither ωr nor r is equal to zero,

153
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:32,310
it is the whole expression that equals zero,
implying ω dot r² = -3/2ωṙr.

154
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,730
This equation will be used to replace ω dot
r²

155
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:40,920
in this formula.
This leads to L dot equals m times

156
00:15:40,920 --> 00:16:10,960
-3/2ωṙr + 2ωṙr. Finally, L dot = 1/2mωrṙ.
It was said that L dot is positive, so looking

157
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:16,740
at this expression
one sees that if m, w and r are positive

158
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:28,430
ṙ also has to be positive.
If ṙ is positive it implies that r increases

159
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:35,310
and so the Moon moves away from The Earth.
This distance increase can be measured

160
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,440
thanks to the retroreflectors placed on the
Moon

161
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:42,320
by the astronauts during the Apollo 11 mission
in 1969.

162
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,440
The property of those retroreflectors is that
they reflect the light

163
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,460
exactly in the incidence direction. If one
aims at them

164
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:53,810
with the beam of a laser from the Earth it
is possible to measure the Earth - Moon distance

165
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:58,080
very precisely by simply measuring
the time it takes for photons to make their

166
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:01,420
return journey.
In practice, the beam of the laser light is

167
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:04,909
sent from a telescope,
photons are reflected and then collected by

168
00:17:04,909 --> 00:17:07,939
the same telescope
after around two seconds.

169
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:11,780
Thanks to this measurement it is possible
to deduce that the change

170
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:16,200
of the Earth - Moon distace is equal to about
3,8 cm per year.

171
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:19,460
In the Solar System, Io, one of the four satellites
of Jupiter,

172
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,329
show an exuberant volcanic activity
due to the tidal forces of Jupiter.

173
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:29,550
Its surface is strewn with volcanoes.
Of the four galilean satellites, Io is the

174
00:17:29,550 --> 00:17:33,250
closest moon to Jupiter
and also the one that has the most eccentric

175
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:37,980
orbit.
The tidal forces regularly compress

176
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:43,060
and dilate the rocky mantle, causing it to
melt.

177
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:48,980
The result is a collection of volcanoes on
the satellite's surface,

178
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:52,870
and some of them, like the volcano Pele shown
here,

179
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:59,460
eject matter fast enough
that it overcomes the satellite's gravitational

180
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:02,740
field and escape.
In the next lecture, we will have the opportunity

181
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:05,910
to see
that the tidal forces can not only cause the

182
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:09,520
rocky mantle to melt,
but may also cause the dislocation of the

183
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,750
satellite,
or even dislocate a celestial body in general.
