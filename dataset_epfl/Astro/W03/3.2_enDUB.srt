1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:07,900
going to run if it's eco mosca in this

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,170
lecture we will see how radiation

3
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:13,750
interacts with the interstellar and

4
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:16,420
intergalactic matter interactions occur

5
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:19,480
at all spatial scales and are analyzed

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:21,130
thanks to images in spectra giving

7
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,079
constraints on the physical conditions

8
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:26,259
of the gas and dust and cosmic clouds

9
00:00:23,079 --> 00:00:28,540
the interstellar gas apart from the

10
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:30,099
primordial hydrogen and helium formed a

11
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,649
few moments after the Big Bang is

12
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:35,320
created by successive generations of

13
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:37,120
stars and is ejected into the

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,969
interstellar medium after the death of

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:43,839
high or low mass stars for low-mass

16
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:46,300
stars ie less massive than eight solar

17
00:00:43,839 --> 00:00:47,859
masses planetary nebulae are formed

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:50,649
while for the stars with masses

19
00:00:47,859 --> 00:00:52,510
exceeding eight solar masses a supernova

20
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:55,659
explosion occurs leaving spectacular

21
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:58,059
filaments as shown in the figure this

22
00:00:55,659 --> 00:01:00,399
image shows the Crab Nebula Messier one

23
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:02,800
that is a result of a supernova

24
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:06,820
explosion visible even to the naked eye

25
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:08,740
in 1054 then the gas is recycled into an

26
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:11,049
interstellar medium in the galaxy like

27
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:13,270
this one Messi or 51 where the hydrogen

28
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:15,399
emission is well visible in the red in

29
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:18,070
the spiral arms of the galaxy the

30
00:01:15,399 --> 00:01:20,350
hydrogen emission is created by the

31
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:24,219
ionized gas excited by the swarm of

32
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:28,060
young massive stars visible in the blue

33
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:32,170
in the arms of the galaxies apart from

34
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:36,340
gas and galaxies there is also dust that

35
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:37,990
absorbs background radiation this effect

36
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,759
can be seen here in the form of dark

37
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,520
trails through the arms of the galaxy

38
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:46,270
the background light is absorbed by dust

39
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:49,750
from this pics of gas and dust new

40
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:53,140
generations of stars possibly associated

41
00:01:49,750 --> 00:01:55,030
planetary systems are formed let's see

42
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:57,759
in details what is happening in a nebula

43
00:01:55,030 --> 00:02:02,259
the Carina Nebula shown here at optical

44
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:05,259
wavelengths some sources of ionization

45
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:08,710
can easily be identified like in this

46
00:02:05,259 --> 00:02:10,690
place a small stellar cluster certainly

47
00:02:08,710 --> 00:02:14,280
composed of young hot stars another

48
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:14,280
stellar cluster can be seen here

49
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:20,630
those stars ionize the surrounding gas

50
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:23,690
sit amet the gas divides and the protons

51
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:26,900
and the electrons possibly they will

52
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,790
recombine electrons fall back into the

53
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:31,940
lower energy level while at the same

54
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:34,970
time emitting photons with a range of

55
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:38,360
wavelengths each color indicates a

56
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:41,150
different emission line as it was shown

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:51,110
in previous chapters the density of the

58
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:52,970
gas is very low roughly one gas particle

59
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:57,290
per centimeter to the third power which

60
00:02:52,970 --> 00:03:00,980
gives p equals 10-21 kilograms divided

61
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,959
by m to the third power there can be

62
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:05,330
great differences in the densities from

63
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:07,640
one nebula to another from one galaxy to

64
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:10,160
another this density corresponds to the

65
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:13,130
ionized gas that often produces emission

66
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:14,870
lines we find also dusty regions similar

67
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:18,200
to those shown before in a spiral galaxy

68
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:20,180
dust absorbs radiation in fact this

69
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:23,780
whole region is affected by dust

70
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:26,420
absorption mass densities in this kind

71
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:28,310
of region are even lower about ten to

72
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:32,540
thirteen particles per centimeter to the

73
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:34,370
third power which is 10 to 13 times

74
00:03:32,540 --> 00:03:36,049
smaller than the gas density on the

75
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:38,180
other hand dust particles are much

76
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:41,120
heavier because the dust is composed of

77
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:43,070
atoms and molecules the mass density is

78
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,079
one of the order of ten to twenty three

79
00:03:43,070 --> 00:03:50,150
kilograms divided by M to the third

80
00:03:45,079 --> 00:03:52,519
power this means that there is 13 orders

81
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:54,650
of magnitude less dust particles than in

82
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:56,930
the gas but in mass density thus there's

83
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:00,049
only 100 times less massive per unit

84
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:02,900
volume than gas all we said previously

85
00:04:00,049 --> 00:04:05,060
was about gas and dust in nebula let's

86
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:07,100
have a closer look at the milky way so

87
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:09,049
objects with much larger spatial scales

88
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:10,730
from this place to this other one in the

89
00:04:09,049 --> 00:04:12,799
slide the distance is about 5

90
00:04:10,730 --> 00:04:15,799
kiloparsecs and the previous slide the

91
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,390
scale was about tens of parsec here the

92
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:19,669
scale corresponds to the kiloparsecs

93
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,849
scale the nebula that was shown just

94
00:04:19,669 --> 00:04:25,280
before as roughly this size quite small

95
00:04:22,849 --> 00:04:28,340
comparing to the Milky Way on the other

96
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,949
hand thus extends over a large region

97
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:36,020
those areas correspond to dusty spots

98
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:41,540
that absorb the light coming from the

99
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:45,050
stars situated behind here are the other

100
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:47,449
dust regions appreciated in conclusion

101
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:49,550
that does in a gas intervene at all

102
00:04:47,449 --> 00:04:51,830
scales let's take a look at what is

103
00:04:49,550 --> 00:04:56,479
happening with the ionized gas that

104
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:59,540
recombines and emits radiation creating

105
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:05,090
something we can observe nebulizers here

106
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:07,010
we will assume a gaseous nebula composed

107
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:09,710
of hydrogen so as the simplify the

108
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:11,419
calculations of course a composition

109
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:14,030
could well be different in this kind of

110
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:17,240
clouds then here is a ionizing source

111
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:19,850
stars this ionizing source splits the

112
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:22,160
atoms of hydrogen in this case into

113
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:23,750
protons and electrons they do not stay

114
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,389
in this state they will tend to

115
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:28,280
recombine and emit light now we will try

116
00:05:26,389 --> 00:05:31,520
to estimate the typical radius of a

117
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:35,270
nebula that isn't a strong run radius

118
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:37,130
enter the astronomer who calculated it

119
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,740
for the first time what we will try to

120
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:45,110
characterize is this limiting radius of

121
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:48,289
the nebula stromgren radius as always in

122
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:50,240
science there is an equilibrium there

123
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:52,729
are ionizing protons coming from the

124
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:55,639
source from the center of the nebula

125
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:57,590
then there are electrons that recombine

126
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:00,620
with the protons that were ionized by

127
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:04,639
the radiation field the flux of ionizing

128
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:09,979
photons is equal to the recombination

129
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:12,110
ratio of the proton electron pairs the

130
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:16,820
number of free combinations is equal to

131
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:21,950
the volume of the nebula 4/3 pi times R

132
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:26,300
3 times the number of available proton

133
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:30,680
electron pairs that is ne4 electrons and

134
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:32,870
NH 4 protons in this equation there was

135
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,360
also a constant that comes from quantum

136
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:37,610
mechanics and the origins of which is

137
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:39,919
not needed to be known here it is just a

138
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,200
physical constant that is equal to about

139
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:48,470
three times 10-13

140
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:50,210
centimeters three times s minus one for

141
00:06:48,470 --> 00:06:54,440
a gas with a temperature around eight

142
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:57,350
thousand Kelvin which is a typical

143
00:06:54,440 --> 00:07:01,040
temperature for diffuse Ned like we have

144
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:03,410
calculated the recombination ratio as

145
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:05,330
the function of radius the parameter

146
00:07:03,410 --> 00:07:07,700
that we are interested in an electron

147
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,620
and proton density in the nebula now

148
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:14,090
let's calculate the number of ionizing

149
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:22,970
photons for the calculations we take a

150
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:24,770
hot start as an ionizing source with the

151
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:29,270
temperature of about forty-five thousand

152
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:32,960
Kelvin this star has a black body

153
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:35,750
spectrum with its luminosity peak in the

154
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:38,930
ultraviolet according to the wine law

155
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:42,140
lambda max is equal to 640 angstrom

156
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:44,180
which is in the ultraviolet part of the

157
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:47,060
spectrum where the photons carry a lot

158
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:50,060
of energy and so they can easily ionize

159
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:54,290
matter here we have a nebula composed of

160
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:56,630
ionized hydrogen before the calculations

161
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:58,550
let's recall a bit of nomenclature we

162
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,250
have talked a lot about hydrogen so

163
00:07:58,550 --> 00:08:04,220
let's now present some notations it may

164
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:06,380
be that you are familiar with it so

165
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:10,580
treat it as a reminder if you have such

166
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:15,740
a notation 1h it stands for a hydrogen

167
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:18,470
nucleus a notation to H stands for a

168
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:20,930
deuterium nucleus in this case there is

169
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,120
one extra Neutron in the nucleus let's

170
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:28,340
move on to the atoms so we have now an

171
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:30,950
electron that we will note as h1 this is

172
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:32,599
an atom of neutral hydrogen the electron

173
00:08:30,950 --> 00:08:38,840
in this atom is in its lowest possible

174
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:42,200
energy state with 13.6 EV it means that

175
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:45,080
in order to ionize a hydrogen atom 13.6

176
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:48,520
EV must be delivered in this case one

177
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:53,080
notes hii for the ionized hydrogen

178
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:59,800
earlier a notation H alpha H beta H

179
00:08:53,080 --> 00:09:01,660
gamma etc was shown paying attention not

180
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:03,460
to confuse it with the notation that was

181
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:05,860
shown before those are the hydrogen

182
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:11,470
emission lines we can also write h2

183
00:09:05,860 --> 00:09:14,260
which indicates the two hydrogen atoms

184
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,210
now form a molecule so beware of all the

185
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:19,900
different notations that is all for the

186
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:23,440
hydrogen nebula now let's recall that we

187
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:25,630
consider a single star with 45,000

188
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,570
Kelvin in the center of the nebula the

189
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:30,910
radiation peak is at 640 angstrom and

190
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:35,080
assuming that most photons belong to

191
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:40,420
that peak each photon has about the

192
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:42,430
energy E gamma equals hv then let us

193
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:44,650
imagine that all photons are indeed

194
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:46,600
emitted at the peak thus all photons

195
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:50,500
have precisely that energy the total

196
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:54,610
amounts to 1.5 for 10-5 j which

197
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:57,880
corresponds to 19 EV obviously those are

198
00:09:54,610 --> 00:10:03,430
photons with an energy higher than the

199
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:08,290
ionization energy 13 point 6 eb it means

200
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:11,650
that if a star surrounded by hydrogen is

201
00:10:08,290 --> 00:10:13,930
considered then with a good

202
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,300
approximation all the hydrogen and the

203
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:20,440
nebula is ionized because of the photon

204
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:25,570
flux carrying an energy higher than the

205
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:27,730
hydrogen ionized energy now we assume

206
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:32,350
that all the hydrogen is ionized and so

207
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:34,810
e equals NH and there is the same number

208
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,700
of electrons and protons this implies

209
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:38,950
that the equation for the recombination

210
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:46,180
ratio can be rewritten as a function of

211
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:49,750
the hydrogen atom density and it is

212
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:51,700
equal to the photon flux carrying an

213
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:56,590
energy at least sufficient to ionize the

214
00:10:51,700 --> 00:11:00,430
atoms inverting this equation we find

215
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:02,230
the radius that is the limiting radius

216
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:07,600
in the equilibrium

217
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:09,430
the stronger and radius it will be equal

218
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:18,010
to three times the number of ionizing

219
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:22,870
photons over 4 PI alpha x + H square to

220
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:25,540
the power 1 / 3 this is the equation for

221
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,250
the stromgren radius it is given as a

222
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:29,200
function of the following values a

223
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,940
physical constant the density of the

224
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:34,810
nebula and the number of ionizing

225
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:38,080
photons the number of the ionizing

226
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:47,260
photons can be estimated in the easiest

227
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:49,570
way it is the stellar luminosity in the

228
00:11:47,260 --> 00:11:52,360
center of the nebula physical / the

229
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:58,900
photon energy for a star with the

230
00:11:52,360 --> 00:12:04,510
surface temperature t 45 thousand Kelvin

231
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:07,150
the luminosity is equal to one point

232
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:15,070
three times ten five solar luminosity

233
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:19,150
this implies that the number of ionizing

234
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:25,690
photons is equal to 12 6 10 49 photons /

235
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:30,820
s this gives an estimate of the number

236
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:39,160
of ionizing photons let's now estimate

237
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:43,330
NH 4 NH equals five thousand / cm3 the

238
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:45,490
nebula is relatively dense and the

239
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:51,790
stronger in radius is roughly equal to 0

240
00:12:45,490 --> 00:12:53,710
point three parsecs this radius depends

241
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,960
on the number of stars in the nebula but

242
00:12:53,710 --> 00:13:02,290
typically the stromgren radius is about

243
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:05,080
point 1 to 100 parsec for a typical

244
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:14,700
nebula in the Milky Way ionized by a

245
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:16,290
small stellar cluster this is the

246
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,420
order of magnitude of the signs of

247
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:22,380
ionized nebulae that can be found in the

248
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:24,090
Milky Way or in galaxies in general this

249
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:27,270
is a wonderful example of a nebula

250
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:29,820
illustrating the stromgren spear NGC 602

251
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:32,400
in a small magellanic cloud which is a

252
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:35,970
satellite galaxy of our galaxy here one

253
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:37,770
can see a group of blue stars in the

254
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:40,350
center of the nebula that ionizes the

255
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:42,390
gas as far as 50 parsec from the center

256
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:44,490
this is not implied that the nebula has

257
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:46,980
its limit at 50 parsec and that there is

258
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:49,410
no gas further away what it means is

259
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:51,300
that the photon flux produced by the

260
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,840
stars in the center of the nebula it's

261
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:59,190
not able to ionize the gas further away

262
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:03,930
than the stronger run radius now we will

263
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:05,250
look closer at the dust absorption here

264
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:07,470
you can see schematically represented

265
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:09,660
some dust grains which size is much

266
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:11,370
larger than the atoms or molecules it

267
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:13,680
could be compared to the dust that is on

268
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:16,980
a table when when does not clean at its

269
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:19,560
place or to the chalk left on the

270
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:23,040
blackboard for example let's take a

271
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:30,330
volume element that is characterized by

272
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:35,340
the length input and output surfaces in

273
00:14:30,330 --> 00:14:37,830
the density taken in a following way

274
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:42,690
this is the numerical density not the

275
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:45,630
mass density so it gives the number of

276
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:48,120
dust grains per unit volume one can see

277
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:50,070
clearly that each dust grain obscures

278
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:55,890
the light that enters the volume element

279
00:14:50,070 --> 00:15:01,140
each dust grain as a cross-section and

280
00:14:55,890 --> 00:15:02,880
obscures a surface da this allows the

281
00:15:01,140 --> 00:15:05,610
determination of the extinction

282
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,980
coefficient that is simply equal to if R

283
00:15:05,610 --> 00:15:10,170
is the grain radius the cross-section of

284
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,480
the dust grains now it is possible to

285
00:15:10,170 --> 00:15:14,880
estimate the fraction of the surface da

286
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:17,190
screened by all the dust grains this

287
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:23,970
would be simply DT the number of the

288
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:24,660
particles in the Box times the

289
00:15:23,970 --> 00:15:26,100
cross-section

290
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:29,850
which we have called the extinction

291
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:32,519
coefficient so dt is equal to n times da

292
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:34,589
times d1 where one is the cylinder

293
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:40,319
volume times the cross section over the

294
00:15:34,589 --> 00:15:44,519
total surface if this expression is

295
00:15:40,319 --> 00:15:46,560
simplified one has the extinction

296
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,470
coefficient times the density times the

297
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:55,800
elements d1 this will be called the

298
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:58,170
optical depth tea this is a

299
00:15:55,800 --> 00:16:00,990
dimensionless quantity that depends on

300
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:03,149
distances one can already see that team

301
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:08,939
x equals 1 corresponds to full

302
00:16:03,149 --> 00:16:14,339
extinction because the obscured surface

303
00:16:08,939 --> 00:16:16,649
is equal to da and so all the radiation

304
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:19,680
is absorbed this is the definition of

305
00:16:16,649 --> 00:16:21,509
the optical depth let's see how to use

306
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:24,000
it in order to estimate the fraction of

307
00:16:21,509 --> 00:16:28,139
flux that is lost if we have the

308
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,600
incident flux here in a given volume f

309
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:38,970
is the outgoing flux that is equal to F

310
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:42,959
plus DF f can be negative and will be in

311
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:46,230
this case as there is absorption D F

312
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:56,220
equals F times DT DT is the optical

313
00:16:46,230 --> 00:17:02,579
depth or as it was called earlier the

314
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:04,110
fraction of the flux that is lost there

315
00:17:02,579 --> 00:17:10,289
was a minus sign because of the losses

316
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:15,600
and so DF divided by F equals minus DT

317
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:20,730
this is a simple equation for which the

318
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:23,250
solution can be written as an

319
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:27,780
exponential with boundary condition that

320
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:29,850
is simply the incident flux the outgoing

321
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:35,909
flux varies with respect to the incident

322
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:38,010
flux t is the integral from 0 to the

323
00:17:35,909 --> 00:17:43,380
distance of the observer

324
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:45,630
so it can't be integrated along the line

325
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:48,300
of sight up to the star at some distance

326
00:17:45,630 --> 00:17:54,270
D here we have n times the extinction

327
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:57,630
coefficient times d1 if we assume that

328
00:17:54,270 --> 00:17:59,940
there is on average n particles along

329
00:17:57,630 --> 00:18:02,700
the line of sight we can simplify this

330
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:05,910
expression he would be and means times

331
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:09,030
the extinction coefficient times the

332
00:18:05,910 --> 00:18:10,830
distance this is the result of the

333
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:12,420
integral with the assumption that the

334
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:15,360
number of particles can be approximated

335
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:19,320
by some mean value from the distant 02

336
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:21,960
the observed object at some distance D

337
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:26,220
so the integration is made from one

338
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:29,130
volume element to another the

339
00:18:26,220 --> 00:18:30,900
integration of the flux that is lost by

340
00:18:29,130 --> 00:18:33,990
a volume element because of the dust

341
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:36,960
grains between the source and the

342
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:40,320
observer the fraction of the flux that

343
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:43,710
is lost expense is called the extinction

344
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:45,900
rewriting the resulting formula f

345
00:18:43,710 --> 00:18:51,150
depends on the distance of the observed

346
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:54,960
object so that FD equals f 0 times e TD

347
00:18:51,150 --> 00:19:01,020
let's try to illustrate that on a graph

348
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:03,900
it is simply an exponential curve the y

349
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:07,890
axis represents the flux and the x-axis

350
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:14,550
the distance at distance 0 the flux is

351
00:19:07,890 --> 00:19:17,130
equal to f0 this is the condition given

352
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:21,120
in the formula when T equals 0 the

353
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:25,140
exponent is equal to 1 so f equals F 0

354
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,780
then the flux is exponentially

355
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:34,680
decreasing at some distance D we have t

356
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:41,610
e when T equals 1 the flux is equal to

357
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:44,520
f0 divided by E which means that 1

358
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:46,500
divided by e times the flux f0 is lost

359
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:49,650
up to the optical path equal to 1

360
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:52,890
astrophysicists prefer to use magnitudes

361
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:55,200
let's take its definition observe

362
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:59,880
magnitude minus the intrinsic magnitude

363
00:19:55,200 --> 00:20:03,030
before the absorption caused by the dust

364
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:05,340
along the line of sight from zero to the

365
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:13,380
distance D this is a situation in which

366
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:16,050
along the line of sight between the

367
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:21,540
observer and a star there is dust and

368
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:23,490
cylinders and nebula etc one has to

369
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:27,510
integrate the absorption along the line

370
00:20:23,490 --> 00:20:37,260
of sight up to some distance D thus m- m

371
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:39,450
0 equals 2.5 times 10 g ft / f 0 using

372
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:47,340
the equation formulated before this is

373
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:50,400
equal to 2.5 times d but one has to pay

374
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:52,140
attention to 10 g e this is a decimal

375
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:58,530
logarithm and not a natural logarithm

376
00:20:52,140 --> 00:21:00,750
one can see that m- m0 is positive what

377
00:20:58,530 --> 00:21:03,090
implies that m is greater than m0

378
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:04,950
remember that the magnitude scale is

379
00:21:03,090 --> 00:21:10,500
logarithmic there is a minus sign here

380
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:12,570
meaning that the observed source is seen

381
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:18,720
with apparent magnitude greater than M 0

382
00:21:12,570 --> 00:21:20,910
which is the intrinsic magnitude before

383
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:24,360
the absorption this signifies that the

384
00:21:20,910 --> 00:21:32,250
source has been absorbed and so fainter

385
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:35,130
than the original we've just talked

386
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:37,230
about absorption but this is not the

387
00:21:35,130 --> 00:21:42,870
only effect present in a volume element

388
00:21:37,230 --> 00:21:48,690
some photons that will be absorbed some

389
00:21:42,870 --> 00:21:55,590
can be reflected back to the source some

390
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:57,420
reflected in an arbitrary direction it's

391
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:59,559
extremely important effect is called

392
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,090
scattering this

393
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:03,190
effect will not be described herein

394
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:05,169
detailed it will be qualitatively shown

395
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:07,480
else can during depends on the particles

396
00:22:05,169 --> 00:22:10,600
radiation there are two types of

397
00:22:07,480 --> 00:22:12,129
scattering when photons propagate

398
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:14,499
through dust they are scattered and the

399
00:22:12,129 --> 00:22:19,840
same way fog would do the first type of

400
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:24,309
scattering is the my scattering it takes

401
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:26,259
place when the radius of the Grange is

402
00:22:24,309 --> 00:22:29,440
much larger than the photons wavelength

403
00:22:26,259 --> 00:22:31,509
in this case the extinction coefficient

404
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,580
is equal to the one given by the my

405
00:22:31,509 --> 00:22:36,940
scattering which is proportional to

406
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:38,769
lambda minus 1 another property that is

407
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:42,700
this type of scattering is directional

408
00:22:38,769 --> 00:22:45,009
it is not isotropic it means that whole

409
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:46,899
time do not scatter in a random

410
00:22:45,009 --> 00:22:49,269
direction they'd rather scatter in a

411
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:54,639
direction that lies closer to the

412
00:22:49,269 --> 00:22:57,100
incidence direction this is the my

413
00:22:54,639 --> 00:23:00,999
scattering another type of scattering is

414
00:22:57,100 --> 00:23:02,409
the Rayleigh scattering it takes place

415
00:23:00,999 --> 00:23:04,090
when the medium consists of small

416
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:07,690
particles smaller than the wavelength

417
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:09,700
for this type of scattering the

418
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:13,960
extinction coefficient depends even

419
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:19,119
stronger on the wavelength as lambda

420
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:22,720
minus four real a scattering is

421
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:25,059
isotropic in conclusion if light is

422
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:28,600
scattered by large grains the scattering

423
00:23:25,059 --> 00:23:32,559
is directional and is more efficient for

424
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:34,629
shorter wavelengths the dependence law

425
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,779
is lambda minus one the Rayleigh

426
00:23:34,629 --> 00:23:39,999
scattering arises for small particles it

427
00:23:37,779 --> 00:23:43,509
is isotropic it also depends on the

428
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:44,919
wavelength it is more effective for the

429
00:23:43,509 --> 00:23:46,899
blue light than for the red light

430
00:23:44,919 --> 00:23:49,059
because of the dependence of the

431
00:23:46,899 --> 00:23:52,899
extinction coefficient as lambda minus

432
00:23:49,059 --> 00:23:59,139
for both types of scattering are more

433
00:23:52,899 --> 00:24:00,730
effective for shorter wavelengths the

434
00:23:59,139 --> 00:24:05,049
consequence of the scattering can be

435
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:06,700
observed on earth both types of

436
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:10,750
scattering can be noticed on this slide

437
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:12,360
firstly the scattering that makes this

438
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:15,750
guy blue

439
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:18,929
you this is the scattering by Adams so

440
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:23,670
all the particles whose radius is very

441
00:24:18,929 --> 00:24:25,530
small compared to the wave light the

442
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:27,809
wavelength is of the order of hundreds

443
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,100
or thousands of angstroms obviously it

444
00:24:27,809 --> 00:24:34,830
is the case of the Rayleigh scattering

445
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:37,470
that is isotropic it was said that the

446
00:24:34,830 --> 00:24:39,780
scattering is more effective for the

447
00:24:37,470 --> 00:24:41,850
bluer light this is the reason why the

448
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,040
sky is blue and why there are no visible

449
00:24:41,850 --> 00:24:47,549
structures the uniform blue color is

450
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:53,160
caused by the isotropic property now

451
00:24:47,549 --> 00:24:56,370
what happens in the cloud the cloud is

452
00:24:53,160 --> 00:25:06,419
composed of water drops so here we can

453
00:24:56,370 --> 00:25:08,520
find rap lots of water with radii much

454
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:10,679
larger than the wavelength in this case

455
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:13,590
the leading process is the my scattering

456
00:25:10,679 --> 00:25:15,840
that is directional this is the reason

457
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:17,490
why one can see obvious structures in

458
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,860
the cloud if the scattering was I so

459
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:24,240
traffic the structures would not be

460
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:27,390
visible in the clouds it works in the

461
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:33,000
same way for nebula that are also cloud

462
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:35,370
air is a reflection nebula m78 in the

463
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:37,590
constellation of Orion reflection or

464
00:25:35,370 --> 00:25:39,660
diffusion nebula it is basically the

465
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:41,669
same in the center of the nebula there

466
00:25:39,660 --> 00:25:48,030
are stars one can find some dusty

467
00:25:41,669 --> 00:25:50,160
regions that absorb light there will be

468
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:52,110
an extinction coefficient is related to

469
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:55,470
these areas there are also some areas

470
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:57,480
where the light is scattered now to see

471
00:25:55,470 --> 00:26:00,630
this in practice the spectrum of the

472
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:07,260
star is a blackbody spectrum the

473
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:09,660
spectrum of a nebula should be composed

474
00:26:07,260 --> 00:26:12,419
of emission lines because of atoms that

475
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:14,970
can be ionized by stars entity

476
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:16,860
ionization they recombine and generate

477
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:19,169
emission lines but this is not the case

478
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:21,330
here those stars are not able to ionize

479
00:26:19,169 --> 00:26:23,370
the surrounding matter instead the light

480
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:25,169
is scattered if the spectrum was taken

481
00:26:23,370 --> 00:26:26,040
in this area it would be a blackbody

482
00:26:25,169 --> 00:26:29,700
spectrum

483
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:31,950
the same spectrum at the one of the

484
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:33,870
stars eliminating the matter around them

485
00:26:31,950 --> 00:26:36,420
that is why obtaining spectra of

486
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:38,550
astronomical objects is so important if

487
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:40,470
one has a spectrum that shows lines the

488
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:42,570
effects present in the nebula are not

489
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:44,670
the same as for the nebula that has a

490
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:46,740
black body spectrum in the latter case

491
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,960
there is light scattering while in the

492
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:51,120
former case atoms are ionized and then

493
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:53,190
they recombine what is the final balance

494
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:55,110
between the different processes in the

495
00:26:53,190 --> 00:26:56,730
nebula there was light scattering and

496
00:26:55,110 --> 00:26:59,340
the absorption that both are more

497
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:02,130
effective for shorter wavelengths and

498
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:05,160
implies two things the first one the

499
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:07,020
absorption is responsible for the fact

500
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:11,550
that the observer sees a source weaker

501
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:13,500
as if it was emitting less light also if

502
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:15,570
the light is absorbed or scattered more

503
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:17,220
effectively for shorter wavelengths and

504
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:20,430
implied that sources observed through

505
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:22,410
dust are reddened this is the

506
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:26,070
interstellar and intergalactic rending

507
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:28,890
this was the first conclusion now if one

508
00:27:26,070 --> 00:27:31,080
wants to observe sources whose light is

509
00:27:28,890 --> 00:27:33,030
strongly absorbed the observations must

510
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:38,220
be done in the infrared light with

511
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:41,010
longer wavelengths propagates through

512
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:42,780
matter more easily the observations are

513
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:45,060
not so simple because it may happen that

514
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:47,520
the source does not emit light at longer

515
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:49,530
wavelengths one has to adapt a means to

516
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,210
the goal of the observations at least as

517
00:27:49,530 --> 00:27:53,250
far as observations through dust is

518
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:55,350
concerned they see let's look at the

519
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:57,630
quantitative description of renting and

520
00:27:55,350 --> 00:27:59,550
its influence magnitude it was said that

521
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:06,300
the color of objects is measured using

522
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:13,740
the color index the intrinsic index it

523
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:17,520
will be called B minus v-0 and is equal

524
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:27,840
to b0 minus B 0 B is linked to be 0

525
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:30,090
through absorption which can be in turn

526
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,750
expressed as an optical depth this is

527
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:35,880
for the blue filter now for the V filter

528
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,049
which is rather than be one has two

529
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:41,429
magnitudes

530
00:28:37,049 --> 00:28:45,239
both are affected by absorption

531
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:50,970
subtracting one equation from the other

532
00:28:45,239 --> 00:28:59,850
Gibbs b minus V equals V minus v-0 minus

533
00:28:50,970 --> 00:29:01,320
av- a be with a be greater than a V

534
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:08,460
because the blue light is absorbed

535
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:12,720
stronger as it was seen before this

536
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:19,529
equation can be rewritten as B minus v-0

537
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:21,480
minus a new term e be minus V that is

538
00:29:19,529 --> 00:29:25,889
used to characterize the reddening of

539
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:30,450
stars e be minus V is the color excess

540
00:29:25,889 --> 00:29:35,519
be minus V greater than B minus V 0

541
00:29:30,450 --> 00:29:36,929
because a be greater than a B it was

542
00:29:35,519 --> 00:29:40,769
shown that larger color indices

543
00:29:36,929 --> 00:29:42,690
correspond to red stars smaller color

544
00:29:40,769 --> 00:29:45,929
indices correspond to bloor stars

545
00:29:42,690 --> 00:29:47,549
provided that the bluer filter is placed

546
00:29:45,929 --> 00:29:49,259
on the left side of the index the

547
00:29:47,549 --> 00:29:51,330
observed index is greater than the

548
00:29:49,259 --> 00:29:54,210
intrinsic index what implies that the

549
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,950
observed source is reddened thanks to

550
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:59,159
the color indices and to the color

551
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,960
excess it is possible to quantify the

552
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,210
way in which the stellar objects are

553
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:06,119
written by dust in the interstellar and

554
00:30:03,210 --> 00:30:08,909
intergalactic medium a direct

555
00:30:06,119 --> 00:30:12,210
illustration of this effect a nebula in

556
00:30:08,909 --> 00:30:14,460
fact a cloud composed of dust seen at

557
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:16,169
different wavelengths this image

558
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:21,450
corresponds to the optical wavelength

559
00:30:16,169 --> 00:30:25,590
the limit in the blue light this image

560
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:27,600
was taken in near-infrared the

561
00:30:25,590 --> 00:30:34,649
wavelength increases in this way across

562
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:36,600
the slide this is the infrared image one

563
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:38,879
can easily see that in the image with

564
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,609
the dust all the radiation from the

565
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:43,830
background is blocked and scattered by

566
00:30:41,609 --> 00:30:45,749
the dust it is lost it does not reach

567
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:48,059
the observer when going further in the

568
00:30:45,749 --> 00:30:50,309
near-infrared one can see more and more

569
00:30:48,059 --> 00:30:51,160
stars near the edge of the nebula one

570
00:30:50,309 --> 00:30:53,020
can see more

571
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:54,970
stars one can see more and more stars

572
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:57,160
when going to the center even more at

573
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:00,820
longer wavelengths in this image almost

574
00:30:57,160 --> 00:31:02,800
all the stars can be seen through the

575
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:06,700
dust this is a cloud of dust in the

576
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:11,740
Milky Way or nard 68 that could be

577
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:16,180
delimited in this way this is an image

578
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:20,920
in false color with the visible light in

579
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:29,620
the blue channel the near-infrared and

580
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:34,030
the green channel and the infrared in

581
00:31:29,620 --> 00:31:37,360
the red channel looking at this image

582
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:40,060
one can at once see a large cloud of

583
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:44,080
dust located along the line of sight to

584
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:47,020
the observer white constantly interacts

585
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:49,030
would matter thanks to these

586
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:52,090
interactions the analysis of the light

587
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:55,810
gives us valuable information the last

588
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:57,460
two lectures showed that this analysis

589
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:59,620
is quite delicate all the physical

590
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,750
processes at play must be taken to

591
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:03,520
account simultaneously continuous

592
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:05,710
absorption or absorption lines

593
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:07,810
continuous emission or emission lines

594
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:10,060
chromatic absorption reflection

595
00:32:07,810 --> 00:32:12,580
scattering which in fact is also a

596
00:32:10,060 --> 00:32:14,590
chromatic phenomenon also one needs to

597
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,630
consider chromatic effects caused by the

598
00:32:14,590 --> 00:32:18,700
Doppler effect rotation thermal

599
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:20,560
agitation of molecules that sometimes

600
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:23,110
broaden the emission in absorption lines

601
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:25,000
only phenomena play a role at some point

602
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:28,680
an important role in our understanding

603
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:28,680
of astronomical objects
