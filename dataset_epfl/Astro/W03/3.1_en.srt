1
00:00:04,196 --> 00:00:08,380
The Doppler-Fizeau is one of the most
invaluable tools in astrophysics.

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,950
It allows a direct measurement of the velocity of stellar objects

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:14,573
and so enables the study of their movement.

4
00:00:14,573 --> 00:00:18,907
When used along with the Viriel 
theorem or the Kepler's laws,

5
00:00:18,907 --> 00:00:21,631
both bringing in the velocities,

6
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:26,396
it also allows indirect measurement 
of the masses of celestial bodies.

7
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:29,771
It concerns the effect of 
the combination of velocities

8
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:33,018
when a source moves with respect 
to the observer.

9
00:00:33,018 --> 00:00:36,979
The wavelength of the emitted wave,
it may be sound or light,

10
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:42,083
decreases if the source moves 
toward the observer,

11
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:44,297
and thus we observe blueshift.

12
00:00:44,297 --> 00:00:48,582
The wavelength increases if 
the source moves away from the observer,

13
00:00:48,582 --> 00:00:52,011
in this case redshift  is observed.

14
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:56,399
One can see here a moving light source 

15
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,180
and a representation of the perception
of wavelength by the observer.

16
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:04,888
When the source moves forward,
the wavelength is compressed

17
00:01:04,888 --> 00:01:06,946
and the light seen by the observer is bluer.

18
00:01:06,946 --> 00:01:09,418
While moving in the opposite direction,

19
00:01:09,418 --> 00:01:12,176
the wavelength increases and so 
it is seen redder,

20
00:01:12,176 --> 00:01:14,645
redshift is observed.

21
00:01:14,645 --> 00:01:16,816
How does the Doppler effect work?

22
00:01:16,816 --> 00:01:19,781
Considering at first a source at rest.

23
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:24,834
It was just said that the Doppler effect is due
to the combination of movements,

24
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,381
the combination of velocities,

25
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:32,963
so the velocity of wavelength propagation
and the velocity of the emitting source.

26
00:01:32,963 --> 00:01:36,564
Here we have a source at rest 
emitting a spherical wave

27
00:01:36,564 --> 00:01:38,941
with some speed <i>c</i>

28
00:01:38,941 --> 00:01:41,065
and wavelength lambda zero (<i>λ0</i>).

29
00:01:41,065 --> 00:01:45,529
λ0 is shown here,

30
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:48,753
so wavelength is the pulsation 
of the wave.

31
00:01:48,753 --> 00:01:54,723
In the case of the light,
the velocity is equal to <i>c</i>.

32
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:57,669
Now, what is happening when 
the source moves?

33
00:01:57,669 --> 00:02:01,022
Here we have a wavefront 
that was emitted at the time

34
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:03,218
when the source was in this place.

35
00:02:03,218 --> 00:02:08,075
The source will continue to emit 
the wavefronts while moving forward.

36
00:02:08,075 --> 00:02:11,025
While this wavefront was emitted,

37
00:02:11,025 --> 00:02:15,905
this one was propagating,
and so on.

38
00:02:15,905 --> 00:02:18,430
Here we arrive at a situation

39
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:22,531
in which the wavefronts were emitted in 
the same way as when the source was at rest

40
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:27,201
but are combined with the velocity of the source.

41
00:02:27,201 --> 00:02:33,674
It can be noticed that the wavefronts 
are closer to each other toward the observer

42
00:02:33,674 --> 00:02:37,286
and further from each other 
in the opposite direction.

43
00:02:37,286 --> 00:02:38,970
How does it work?

44
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:42,772
Here the wavelengths will appear bluer 

45
00:02:42,772 --> 00:02:44,580
and here redder.

46
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:51,694
Now, let's draw the axis representing
the direction of the observer

47
00:02:51,694 --> 00:02:56,572
and the source 
with some velocity <i>v</i>.

48
00:02:56,572 --> 00:02:58,883
Then, the source emits the wavefronts

49
00:02:58,883 --> 00:03:04,309
so we can draw one here 
and another one over here.

50
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:11,645
Wavelength emitted by the source at rest,

51
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:14,781
will be called <i>λ0</i>.

52
00:03:14,781 --> 00:03:17,709
Now we consider <i>Δt</i>,

53
00:03:17,709 --> 00:03:22,209
the time interval between two wavefronts 
seen by the observer.

54
00:03:22,209 --> 00:03:25,386
What will be this time interval?

55
00:03:25,386 --> 00:03:29,302
Obviously, if the source is at rest
<i>Δt</i> is equal to <i>Δt0</i>,

56
00:03:29,302 --> 00:03:31,057
which is also the period of the wave.

57
00:03:31,057 --> 00:03:36,491
We can say that <i>Δt0</i> is the 
period of the wave,

58
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,113
the period of 
the wave at rest.

59
00:03:39,113 --> 00:03:46,188
The relation between those two time intervals 
is <i>Δt</i> = <i>Δt0</i> if nothing moves.

60
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:50,827
But if the source is not at rest,
during the time <i>Δt0</i>

61
00:03:50,827 --> 00:03:55,961
it will move a given distance <i>Δx</i>

62
00:03:55,961 --> 00:03:59,063
continuously emitting wavefronts.

63
00:03:59,063 --> 00:04:05,044
Finally, the time separating two wavefronts 
seen by the observer

64
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:08,513
will be equal to <i>Δt0</i>  minus another 
time interval

65
00:04:08,513 --> 00:04:12,784
that is equal to the time needed for the source 
to move with the velocity <i>v</i>

66
00:04:12,784 --> 00:04:18,747
a distance <i>Δx</i>
that is shown here.

67
00:04:18,747 --> 00:04:22,984
Of course, the velocity of the wave is <i>c</i>.

68
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:29,900
Now, one just has to rewrite <i>Δx</i> as <i>vΔt0</i>

69
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:34,106
which is the distance the source 
moved during the time that separates

70
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:38,559
two wavefronts at rest with 
the velocity <i>v</i>.

71
00:04:38,559 --> 00:04:39,918
Obviously, it is divided by <i>c</i>

72
00:04:39,918 --> 00:04:43,316
as the wave is propagating with 
the speed of light

73
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,737
in the case of the electromagnetic waves.

74
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:54,216
We also have that  
<i>λ</i>= <i>cΔt</i>,

75
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:56,587
so it suffices to divide the whole 
expression by  <i>c</i>

76
00:04:56,587 --> 00:05:01,436
to obtain that <i>λ</i> , the wavelength 
seen by the observer,

77
00:05:01,436 --> 00:05:08,808
is  <i>λ</i> minus <i>v/c λ0</i>.

78
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,227
This is the expression for the Doppler effect

79
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:14,945
that combines the wavelength
in the reference frame of the source,

80
00:05:14,945 --> 00:05:16,915
so, what the source sees 
while emitting the wave,

81
00:05:16,915 --> 00:05:19,617
and the wavelength seen 
by the observer.

82
00:05:19,617 --> 00:05:24,803
Here the case of the source moving toward
the observer was presented,

83
00:05:24,803 --> 00:05:29,509
but if the source moves away,
the sign changes here for +,

84
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:32,098
so we would be in the situation where 

85
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:36,115
the wave propagates in a
direction opposite to the observer.

86
00:05:36,115 --> 00:05:38,675
The expression for the Doppler effect
can be written in several different ways.

87
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:44,502
In the previous slide 
it was written in this way.

88
00:05:44,502 --> 00:05:47,100
The minus sign is due to the fact that,

89
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:50,613
as was seen in the figure which 
was just drawn,

90
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:52,852
the source moves toward the observer.

91
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,155
The plus sign appears if the source 
moves away from the observer.

92
00:05:56,155 --> 00:05:57,516
It should be noted that

93
00:05:57,516 --> 00:05:59,183
the sources do not always 

94
00:05:59,183 --> 00:06:02,274
move in the same direction as the 
line of sight to the observer.

95
00:06:02,274 --> 00:06:06,272
Let say the observer
is in this place.

96
00:06:06,272 --> 00:06:11,157
In one situation the source can
go in the direction of the observer,

97
00:06:11,157 --> 00:06:14,846
but there can also be the case in which
the source moves in the other direction. 

98
00:06:14,846 --> 00:06:17,892
Let this be the velocity vector,
the angle <i>θ</i> is the angle

99
00:06:17,892 --> 00:06:22,599
between the line connecting the source
with the observer and the velocity vector.


100
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:25,085
What counts in this case

101
00:06:25,085 --> 00:06:30,061
is the velocity of the source
along the line of sight - 

102
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:33,185
the velocity that is projected
on the line of sight.

103
00:06:33,185 --> 00:06:37,185
So in fact the full expression
for the Doppler effect

104
00:06:37,185 --> 00:06:41,632
Is <i>Δλ</i>/<i>λ</i>,
or  <i>λ -λ0</i>/<i>λ0</i>,

105
00:06:41,632 --> 00:06:47,997
equals <i>minus v over c </i> times
the cosine of the angle between the velocity vector

106
00:06:47,997 --> 00:06:51,606
and the line of sight connecting the source
to the observer.

107
00:06:51,606 --> 00:06:58,500
Clearly, <i>θ</i> takes the values in the range
from <i>0</i> to <i>π</i>.

108
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:04,193
The redshift is often written as <i>z</i>

109
00:07:04,193 --> 00:07:11,695
The redshift is often written as <i>z</i>

110
00:07:11,695 --> 00:07:16,584
and relates for example to the cosmological redshift.

111
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:22,065
The expression for the Doppler effect
can be written in more compact way

112
00:07:22,065 --> 00:07:26,557
as <i>λ</i> = <i>λ0</i> times <i>(1 + z)</i>.

113
00:07:26,557 --> 00:07:29,748
If the velocity or the redshift of 
the source is known,

114
00:07:29,748 --> 00:07:31,834
one can relate the observed wavelengths

115
00:07:31,834 --> 00:07:35,465
to the wavelengths emitted by the source

116
00:07:35,465 --> 00:07:37,444
as if it was at rest.

117
00:07:37,444 --> 00:07:39,446
We have already defined the redshift,

118
00:07:39,446 --> 00:07:42,233
but how in practice the redshift
is measured ?

119
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:43,212
or the blueshift is measured ?

120
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,040
Speaking of colours,

121
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,672
one can see here an example of 
the spectrum, the image of a star

122
00:07:49,672 --> 00:07:52,667
as seen with a telescope.

123
00:07:52,667 --> 00:07:56,567
The image, instead of being directly 
recorded with the CCD camera

124
00:07:56,567 --> 00:07:58,144
or another detector,

125
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:02,141
is divided into many parts from
which one is selected.

126
00:08:02,141 --> 00:08:05,675
In fact, in focal plane of the telescope

127
00:08:05,675 --> 00:08:07,697
a mask is placed

128
00:08:07,697 --> 00:08:13,354
in the shape of 
the slit, as shown here.

129
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:16,710
The image if the slit can be 
observed with a prism

130
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:19,386
or a diffraction grating.

131
00:08:19,386 --> 00:08:21,685
In this way the image of the slit

132
00:08:21,685 --> 00:08:22,922
can be observed over the whole
range of wavelengths.

133
00:08:22,922 --> 00:08:25,326
So the spectrograph works in such a way

134
00:08:25,326 --> 00:08:27,666
that the image is formed in the 
focal plane of the telescope,

135
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,900
then a part of this image is selected.

136
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,025
Here the star is seen as a point

137
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:34,942
so the light is dispersed from the blue to the red 
part of the spectrum, as illustrated in the figure.

138
00:08:34,942 --> 00:08:38,617
If the observed object was an extended light 
source, there would be a spectrum like this one

139
00:08:38,617 --> 00:08:40,513
at all the points of the slit.

140
00:08:40,513 --> 00:08:42,017
So what the spectrograph does

141
00:08:42,017 --> 00:08:46,153
is to create an image of the slit
at all wavelengths.

142
00:08:46,153 --> 00:08:53,523
Here we would have the slit seen
in green light,

143
00:08:53,523 --> 00:08:57,556
and in this place the image of the 
slit can be drawn

144
00:08:57,556 --> 00:09:01,309
at the wavelengths toward the red 
part of the spectrum.  

145
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:06,354
The idea behind this is to create
the image of the slit

146
00:09:06,354 --> 00:09:07,677
at all wavelengths.

147
00:09:07,677 --> 00:09:12,145
The slit is placed here,
the image of the slit is created.

148
00:09:12,145 --> 00:09:17,408
The spectrum is the combination of the
successive images of the slit.

149
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,018
Once we have the spectrum,

150
00:09:20,018 --> 00:09:22,754
how the redshift can be measured 
in practise?

151
00:09:22,754 --> 00:09:24,942
As an example we show a nebula

152
00:09:24,942 --> 00:09:28,172
or a gas cloud emitting
emission lines.

153
00:09:28,172 --> 00:09:34,520
This gas cloud moves for example
in the direction of the observer

154
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:37,332
that is placed here.

155
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:47,930
In this situation the cloud has some
velocity towards the line of sight to the observer,

156
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,734
let it be the velocity <i>v</i>.

157
00:09:49,734 --> 00:09:52,173
In this case a blueshift is expected
to occur.

158
00:09:52,173 --> 00:09:57,920
Let’s draw the spectrum of this object.

159
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,500
We place 

160
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,996
two axes

161
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:05,412
and draw a simple spectrum

162
00:10:05,412 --> 00:10:07,594
that is just an emission line.

163
00:10:07,594 --> 00:10:13,033
On the y axis we have the flux <i>Fλ</i>, 
and the x-axis corresponds to the wavelength. 

164
00:10:13,033 --> 00:10:17,871
If we consider this simple spectrum
composed of one emission line,

165
00:10:17,871 --> 00:10:25,204
for example the hydrogen line <i>Hα</i>
at 6565 ångström (Å),

166
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:26,813
what will happen to this line ?

167
00:10:26,813 --> 00:10:29,913
In this case we have a blueshift

168
00:10:29,913 --> 00:10:36,539
so the line shifted toward the blue
will be seen here

169
00:10:38,549 --> 00:10:40,737
and in this case

170
00:10:40,737 --> 00:10:43,767
the wavelength of the line 

171
00:10:43,767 --> 00:10:50,248
will be <i>λ</i> =<i>λ0 times 1 minus v/c</i>.

172
00:10:50,248 --> 00:10:52,391
Conversely,

173
00:10:52,391 --> 00:10:55,615
if the velocity vector is in the 
opposite direction,

174
00:10:55,615 --> 00:10:59,115
so, when the source moves away from the observer,

175
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,777
then we observe a red shift

176
00:11:01,777 --> 00:11:05,253
and the spectrum shifts
toward red

177
00:11:05,253 --> 00:11:07,180
and will be seen in this way.

178
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:14,699
The redshifted line will have
the wavelength of <i>λ= λ0 times 1 plus v / c</i>.

179
00:11:14,699 --> 00:11:18,673
So in this case the cloud moves
toward the observer.

180
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:20,903
If the cloud moves 

181
00:11:20,903 --> 00:11:24,556
in a different direction
than along the line of sight to the observer,

182
00:11:24,556 --> 00:11:26,541
we can choose for example this direction,

183
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:31,387
one has to multiply the velocity <i>v</i>
by the cosine of the angle <i>θ</i>.

184
00:11:31,387 --> 00:11:35,631
We have just seen an example 
of a cloud

185
00:11:35,631 --> 00:11:40,943
emitting a line, in our case
the line <i>Hα</i>.

186
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:43,302
Now, we can look at the situation
in which there is an absorption line.

187
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:46,737
Obviously, Doppler effect applies
also in this case.

188
00:11:46,737 --> 00:11:51,036
Here we have a star

189
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:57,368
whose spectrum is that of
the  black body.

190
00:11:57,368 --> 00:12:04,916
The light of the star passes through
the cloud composed of cold gas

191
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:08,054
and propagates toward the observer.

192
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:12,423
The cloud of cold gas

193
00:12:12,423 --> 00:12:16,223
contains atoms, for example
hydrogen

194
00:12:16,223 --> 00:12:17,614
but it can also include other atoms.

195
00:12:17,614 --> 00:12:21,824
We can have for example the line <i>Hα</i>
that we have just seen

196
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:26,354
with the wavelength 6565 ångström  (Å),
so the optical line,

197
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:30,349
or a line of the Lyman series - <i>Lyman α</i>,

198
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:34,309
at 1216 ångström  (Å).

199
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:38,445
We have the situation in which
there is a cloud of cold gas

200
00:12:38,445 --> 00:12:41,871
that absorbs light, creating an
absorption spectrum

201
00:12:41,871 --> 00:12:44,186
seen superposed with the spectrum of the star.

202
00:12:44,826 --> 00:12:52,152
Firstly, we draw the velocity vector
of the cloud

203
00:12:55,362 --> 00:12:58,342
and the spectrum,

204
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:02,597
as before the y axis corresponds to <i>Fλ</i>,
x axis to <i>λ</i>.

205
00:13:02,597 --> 00:13:04,748
We could also have <i>Fν</i>, <i>ν</i>

206
00:13:04,748 --> 00:13:06,289
if we would like to present
the spectrum in a different way.

207
00:13:06,289 --> 00:13:10,166
This is the curve representing
the black body spectrum,

208
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:11,942
the Planck spectrum,

209
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:15,467
as an example it could be the spectrum 
of the Sun at 5780 K.

210
00:13:15,467 --> 00:13:17,978
What will be observed depends on
the velocity of the cloud:

211
00:13:18,878 --> 00:13:24,434
if the cloud is at rest,
an absorption line,

212
00:13:24,434 --> 00:13:29,934
for example the line <i>Hα</i>,

213
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:34,230
will be observed 

214
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:42,100
at <i>λ</i> equal to <i>λ0</i> =6565 ångström,
as <i>v</i> = 0.

215
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:44,515
If the cloud moves toward the
observer

216
00:13:44,515 --> 00:13:46,343
the line will be blueshifted

217
00:13:46,343 --> 00:13:49,674
and the same absorption line

218
00:13:49,674 --> 00:13:52,345
will be observed but toward
the blue part of the spectrum.

219
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:59,805
In this case <i>λ</i> = <i>λ0 (1- v/c)</i>.

220
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:04,408
As we have seen, the Doppler effect

221
00:14:04,408 --> 00:14:07,250
applies for the emission lines, 
as well as for the absorption lines.

222
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,899
Now we will see in details how 
the Doppler effect can be used.

223
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:14,447
As an example we take the case of the rotation
of the Sun or of the stars in general.

224
00:14:14,447 --> 00:14:20,688
We draw the rotation axis of the Sun

225
00:14:20,688 --> 00:14:25,946
and the solar equator.

226
00:14:25,946 --> 00:14:28,978
Then, we can take the solar spectrum

227
00:14:28,978 --> 00:14:31,830
by placing the slit in this way

228
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:34,817
in order to select a piece of the Sun.

229
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:40,221
Here, the slit is drawn quite large on purpose.

230
00:14:40,221 --> 00:14:45,266
In this position, at the border of the Sun,
the velocity vector is directed toward the observer,

231
00:14:45,266 --> 00:14:46,804
it will be at position 1.

232
00:14:46,804 --> 00:14:48,775
On the equator,

233
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:53,024
the velocity vector is tangential,

234
00:14:53,024 --> 00:14:56,315
this will be position 3.

235
00:14:56,315 --> 00:14:59,165
In this place the velocity vector
has the opposite direction than at position 1,

236
00:14:59,165 --> 00:15:02,119
it can be called position 2.

237
00:15:02,119 --> 00:15:05,942
It was said that the spectrum
is the image of the slit

238
00:15:05,942 --> 00:15:07,388
at different wavelengths.

239
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:11,718
We will represent it in this image;
drawing the slit

240
00:15:11,718 --> 00:15:14,768
thicker than before

241
00:15:14,768 --> 00:15:16,688
and selecting a line that would be

242
00:15:16,688 --> 00:15:21,485
in the green part of the spectrum.

243
00:15:21,485 --> 00:15:25,290
Then we will look at the points 1, 2 and 3
on the slit.

244
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:34,548
The point 3 is in this place, the point 1
in the upper part, and the point 2 is here.


245
00:15:35,468 --> 00:15:39,006
We can see that the point 2 
is moving away from us

246
00:15:39,006 --> 00:15:44,940
so the point that is in this place 
will be redshifted.

247
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:47,477
The velocity at point 3 

248
00:15:47,477 --> 00:15:50,563
does not have a radial component

249
00:15:50,563 --> 00:15:52,697
so this point stays in the same place

250
00:15:52,697 --> 00:15:55,313
its wavelength being equal to
<i>λ</i> =<i>λ0</i>.

251
00:15:55,313 --> 00:15:59,357
Point 1 is moving in our direction

252
00:15:59,357 --> 00:16:02,914
so it will be blueshifted.

253
00:16:02,914 --> 00:16:05,106
One can imagine

254
00:16:05,106 --> 00:16:10,425
the series of points for which
the redshift will be measured.

255
00:16:10,425 --> 00:16:13,709
There are different velocities

256
00:16:13,709 --> 00:16:17,571
so in this place the points 
are blueshifted.

257
00:16:17,571 --> 00:16:20,883
In this way, a new image of the slit
can be seen

258
00:16:20,883 --> 00:16:29,017
when all the points are shifted in such manner.

259
00:16:29,017 --> 00:16:32,372
If the wavelength at rest

260
00:16:32,372 --> 00:16:34,757
is equal to <i>λ0</i>,

261
00:16:34,757 --> 00:16:37,110
once shifted, all the wavelengths <i>λ0</i>
will be placed

262
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:40,222
on the new image of the slit.

263
00:16:40,222 --> 00:16:43,285
Consequently, all the emission or
absorption lines of the Sun

264
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:45,562
will be seen inclined in the spectrum.

265
00:16:45,562 --> 00:16:47,750
Obviously, if  the star was rotating 
in the other direction

266
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:50,510
the new image of the slit would be
tilted also in the opposite direction.

267
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:56,594
Now let's look at an important application
in astrophysics,

268
00:16:56,594 --> 00:17:00,513
namely the search of the exoplanets
using the measurement of the radial velocities

269
00:17:00,513 --> 00:17:04,921
of the stars that host 
a planetary system

270
00:17:04,921 --> 00:17:06,608
outside the Solar system.

271
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:08,872
It is not an easy task

272
00:17:08,872 --> 00:17:13,669
because the distance between
a star and a planet

273
00:17:13,669 --> 00:17:15,573
is small,

274
00:17:15,573 --> 00:17:20,067
and the luminosity contrast
between those two is generally 

275
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,861
very high.

276
00:17:21,861 --> 00:17:25,892
The contrasts can reach tens of magnitude,
in some cases even more.

277
00:17:25,892 --> 00:17:28,571
So it is difficult to directly detect

278
00:17:28,571 --> 00:17:32,606
an exoplanet with direct imaging

279
00:17:32,606 --> 00:17:37,140
around the host star.

280
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,526
Let's see what happens when the planet
rotates about

281
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:46,300
the centre of mass of the 
star-planet system.

282
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,763
Representing a few positions

283
00:17:47,763 --> 00:17:52,856
during the planet's rotation,

284
00:17:52,856 --> 00:17:55,248
and drawing what is happening
at each position;

285
00:17:55,248 --> 00:18:00,650
Here is the star and

286
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,931
its planet are at position 1.

287
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:08,546
In this place we mark the centre of gravity
of those two objects,

288
00:18:09,206 --> 00:18:16,065
here position 2 of the star
and the corresponding position of the planet.

289
00:18:16,065 --> 00:18:21,595
At position 3 the planet
is here,

290
00:18:21,985 --> 00:18:26,589
while for position 4 here. 

291
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:31,262
Of course each time the velocity vector

292
00:18:31,262 --> 00:18:39,983
at positions 1, 2, 3 and 4

293
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:42,862
is equal to <i>vmax</i>.

294
00:18:42,862 --> 00:18:46,777
One has to pay attention, to the fact that the velocity 
is equal to <i>vmax</i> times <i>sinus i</i>,

295
00:18:46,777 --> 00:18:49,077
which is measurable with 
spectroscopic measurements,

296
00:18:49,077 --> 00:18:51,976
on account of the inclination
of the planetary orbit

297
00:18:51,976 --> 00:18:55,604
with regard to the plane of the sky.

298
00:18:55,964 --> 00:18:59,085
This is the direction to the 
observer.

299
00:18:59,425 --> 00:19:02,488
When the spectrum of the
system is available

300
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:04,851
it is only the star that is visible

301
00:19:04,851 --> 00:19:06,054
and not the planet.

302
00:19:06,054 --> 00:19:10,523
Those are the oscillations of the star's
velocity that will be detected

303
00:19:10,523 --> 00:19:14,538
around the centre of mass of the
star-planet system.

304
00:19:14,538 --> 00:19:16,014
Let's draw this situation.

305
00:19:16,014 --> 00:19:23,348
The important data can be obtained
from the star's spectra

306
00:19:23,348 --> 00:19:27,054
taken at regular intervals.

307
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:30,232
The velocity will be presented
on the y axis,

308
00:19:30,232 --> 00:19:33,938
so <i>v sin i</i>, as a function of time.

309
00:19:33,938 --> 00:19:36,566
This curve is called 
the velocity curve.

310
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:40,730
Obviously, the stars in the Galaxy
have some velocity

311
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:47,203
so we need to centre the axis
on the mean velocity

312
00:19:47,203 --> 00:19:48,632
of our star in the Galaxy.

313
00:19:48,632 --> 00:19:51,908
This velocity is typically equal
to some tens or hundreds of km/s.

314
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:55,465
The mean velocity

315
00:19:55,465 --> 00:19:56,955
can be represented 

316
00:19:56,955 --> 00:19:59,212
in this way

317
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:01,105
with an arbitrary direction.

318
00:20:01,105 --> 00:20:03,728
This vector represents the mean 
velocity of the star in the Galaxy,

319
00:20:03,728 --> 00:20:07,097
so the velocity of the centre 
of mass of the system.

320
00:20:07,097 --> 00:20:11,152
The star rotates about 
the centre of mass,

321
00:20:11,152 --> 00:20:15,155
and we can put the data coming 
from the different positions on the diagram.

322
00:20:16,295 --> 00:20:19,850
Starting with position 1:

323
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:23,531
if the observer is here, 

324
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:28,356
there is no
radial component of the velocity

325
00:20:28,356 --> 00:20:32,082
and  no change observed with
respect to the mean velocity.

326
00:20:32,082 --> 00:20:34,771
On the contrary, for position 2

327
00:20:34,771 --> 00:20:37,938
the velocity vector is radial
with respect to the observer,

328
00:20:37,938 --> 00:20:41,882
and a point corresponding
to this position can be placed here.

329
00:20:42,172 --> 00:20:48,023
This velocity is equal to 
<i>v mean</i> +<i>v max</i> <i>sin i</i> .

330
00:20:48,023 --> 00:20:50,717
Position 3 corresponds to position 1,

331
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:53,360
with the difference that this point
is obtained further in time.

332
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,625
As before, the velocity is equal to the mean 
velocity because of the lack of the radial component.

333
00:20:58,625 --> 00:21:00,787
Position 4 is similar
to position 2

334
00:21:00,787 --> 00:21:03,534
but the velocity vector has
the opposite direction

335
00:21:03,534 --> 00:21:05,512
so on the diagram the point
should be placed on the other side.

336
00:21:05,512 --> 00:21:13,851
The velocity in this case is equal to
<i>v mean</i> minus <i>v max</i> times
the sine of the inclination.

337
00:21:13,851 --> 00:21:18,562
By connecting the points

338
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:21,054
 we obtain the velocity curve

339
00:21:21,054 --> 00:21:23,422
which is obviously periodic.

340
00:21:24,452 --> 00:21:29,735
So what we can measure directly
is the rotation period

341
00:21:30,795 --> 00:21:34,806
of the star around the
centre of gravity

342
00:21:34,806 --> 00:21:38,301
which is equal to the rotation period
of the planet around the centre of gravity,

343
00:21:38,301 --> 00:21:40,552
as we are in the frame of the 
centre of mass of the system.

344
00:21:40,552 --> 00:21:44,103
That kind of curve, the velocity curve
of a star, suffices 

345
00:21:44,103 --> 00:21:46,646
to deduce the period of rotation
of the planet

346
00:21:46,646 --> 00:21:53,299
and the maximal velocity of the star
rotating around the gravity centre.

347
00:21:53,299 --> 00:21:57,231
This was another important application
of the Doppler effect.

348
00:21:57,231 --> 00:22:01,425
At last, the Hubble law, so we do now a drastic change
in spatial scales

349
00:22:01,425 --> 00:22:02,936
and enter into the domain of 
cosmology.

350
00:22:02,936 --> 00:22:05,458
As the Universe expands,

351
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:08,972
the distances between the galaxies,

352
00:22:09,912 --> 00:22:11,774
schematically presented in the figure,

353
00:22:11,774 --> 00:22:15,678
will increase with time.

354
00:22:15,678 --> 00:22:17,686
Because of this expansion

355
00:22:17,686 --> 00:22:20,682
so, after some time the galaxies have
moved away from each other.

356
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:25,077
The metric expanded

357
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:28,570
and all the arrows drawn here on the image
become larger.

358
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,807
Due to the increased distances,

359
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:33,139
if the observer was placed in
one of those galaxies

360
00:22:33,139 --> 00:22:36,691
he/she would observe the other 
galaxies moving away.

361
00:22:36,691 --> 00:22:40,547
The Hubble law

362
00:22:40,547 --> 00:22:43,282
relates the velocity of galaxies
that move away,

363
00:22:43,282 --> 00:22:45,685
this velocity being completely radial

364
00:22:45,685 --> 00:22:48,645
with respect to the line
of sight to each galaxy.

365
00:22:48,645 --> 00:22:53,377
so the velocity of these galaxies is proportional 
to the distance between the galaxies.

366
00:22:53,777 --> 00:22:57,042
These velocities of the galaxies
are measured using the Doppler effect,

367
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:02,690
the distance, as it will be seen later, 
is measured with the distance modulus.

368
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:06,727
Then, the proportionality constant 
can be deduced.

369
00:23:06,727 --> 00:23:08,246
As we have seen during
this lecture,

370
00:23:08,246 --> 00:23:11,607
the Doppler-Fizeau effect has
lots of applications in astrophysics:

371
00:23:11,607 --> 00:23:16,818
from the search for exoplanets
using velocity curves 

372
00:23:16,818 --> 00:23:20,241
of stars hosting planets,

373
00:23:20,241 --> 00:23:23,371
to the rotation of stars

374
00:23:23,371 --> 00:23:26,061
and to the measurement of the temperature
of the interstellar medium,

375
00:23:26,061 --> 00:23:28,650
or to the measure of the rate 
of expansion of the Universe

376
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:32,078
using the recessional velocity
of galaxies.

377
00:23:32,078 --> 00:23:35,307
We will get back many times to the 
Doppler effect during this course.

378
00:23:35,307 --> 00:23:37,174
It is worth mentioning that

379
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:41,242
each time a theoretical model, an idea
or a concept predicts velocities,

380
00:23:41,242 --> 00:23:46,285
the practical way of measuring them
will be by using the Doppler effect.
