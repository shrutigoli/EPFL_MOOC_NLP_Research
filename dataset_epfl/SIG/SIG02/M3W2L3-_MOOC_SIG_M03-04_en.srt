00:00:32,007 --> 00:00:33,693
Hello and welcome to this lesson

2
00:00:33,897 --> 00:00:35,863
dedicated to geostatistics and kriging,

3
00:00:36,323 --> 00:00:38,798
a method of advanced interpolation.

4
00:00:39,199 --> 00:00:41,210
We have recently seen that 
the uncertainty

5
00:00:41,425 --> 00:00:43,422
of the results provided by 
the local deterministic 

6
00:00:43,624 --> 00:00:45,887
interpolation methods was a problem.

7
00:00:46,094 --> 00:00:47,968
More in-depth knowledge

8
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:51,168
on the nature of the spatial 
distribution were necessary

9
00:00:51,368 --> 00:00:54,049
and as early as the 1940s, 
it is on this subject

10
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:56,349
that Danie Krige and Georges Matheron 

11
00:00:56,549 --> 00:00:57,911
focused their research works.

12
00:00:58,118 --> 00:01:00,413
Their respective contributions have allowed

13
00:01:00,638 --> 00:01:04,451
to develop and consolidate
the concept of regional variable.

14
00:01:04,656 --> 00:01:06,687
The first goal of this 
lesson is to present

15
00:01:06,887 --> 00:01:10,089
the concept of regionalized variable,
introduced to describe

16
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:13,127
the particular nature
of a variable that characterizes

17
00:01:13,352 --> 00:01:15,177
a continuous spatial phenomenon.

18
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:19,430
This type of variable
plays a fundamental role in geostatistics.

19
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:22,804
Next, we will introduce
concepts and key tools

20
00:01:23,004 --> 00:01:25,329
like the variographic
cloud or the variogram,

21
00:01:25,529 --> 00:01:28,292
before explaining
the functionning of the kriging

22
00:01:28,568 --> 00:01:30,315
This information will allow you
to acquire

23
00:01:30,515 --> 00:01:32,428
basic knowledge of geostatistics

24
00:01:32,628 --> 00:01:35,565
and to apply a standard variographic
analysis procedure

25
00:01:35,765 --> 00:01:38,765
and kriging interpolation
to any set of measures

26
00:01:38,965 --> 00:01:41,765
which characterizes a continuous
spatial phenomenon.

27
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:44,952
We will start with a brief
introduction to geostatistics,

28
00:01:45,152 --> 00:01:46,977
then we will follow
the course of a procedure

29
00:01:47,177 --> 00:01:48,814
of empirical variographic analysis,

30
00:01:49,027 --> 00:01:51,339
which will allow
to introduce progressively

31
00:01:51,539 --> 00:01:52,777
the notions of variographic cloud,

32
00:01:52,989 --> 00:01:54,977
of experimental variogram,

33
00:01:55,177 --> 00:01:57,189
of surface and directional
variogram

34
00:01:57,389 --> 00:02:00,839
and of the theoretical variogram,
before proceeding to the kriging.

35
00:02:04,406 --> 00:02:07,634
To what extent can we
estimate a value at any point

36
00:02:07,859 --> 00:02:09,596
of a domain by interpolation?

37
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,562
And if the answer is yes,

38
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:14,525
what interpolation law
is it judicious to apply?

39
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:15,934
Is it linear?

40
00:02:16,134 --> 00:02:18,921
Is it quadratic
or even of another nature ?

41
00:02:19,156 --> 00:02:21,175
These questions are answered
if we are able

42
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:23,888
to propose a complete
and rigorous theory

43
00:02:24,088 --> 00:02:28,013
which allows to model the relation 
between the behavior of the sample

44
00:02:28,213 --> 00:02:31,488
and that of the phenomenon
on the whole domain.

45
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:34,093
This problematic is a matter
of geostatistics

46
00:02:34,318 --> 00:02:37,085
which has its roots in the study
of random functions,

47
00:02:37,322 --> 00:02:39,797
developed in particular
by Kolmogorov and Weiner

48
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:42,297
during the 1930s and 1940s.

49
00:02:42,531 --> 00:02:44,506
But we attribute the first works

50
00:02:44,718 --> 00:02:47,318
to the South-African mining
engineer Danie Krige.

51
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:50,126
Krige examined the spatial correlations

52
00:02:50,326 --> 00:02:51,851
between two sampled points

53
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:54,326
depending on the distance
between them

54
00:02:54,526 --> 00:02:57,701
and he has proposed the variogram
to represent them.

55
00:02:58,406 --> 00:03:01,603
His approach was then taken up
by the French mathematician,

56
00:03:01,803 --> 00:03:04,686
Geogres Matheron, at the beginning
of 1960s

57
00:03:04,898 --> 00:03:07,673
to establish
the theoretical foundations.

58
00:03:07,994 --> 00:03:11,071
Matheron introduced the concept 
of regionalized variable

59
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:14,209
to describe the particular
nature of a variable characterizing

60
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:16,046
a continuous spatial phenomenon

61
00:03:16,246 --> 00:03:18,903
and he appealed to the notion
of random function

62
00:03:19,103 --> 00:03:22,028
to develop a rigorous
and complete theory.

63
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:25,353
The concept of regionalized variable
and variogram

64
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:26,553
are the two basic tools

65
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:29,228
at the service of kriging 
interpolation techniques.

66
00:03:29,581 --> 00:03:32,564
We will discover
their role and functioning

67
00:03:32,764 --> 00:03:36,652
by gradually applying
a variographic analysis procedure

68
00:03:36,852 --> 00:03:39,327
to a set of empirical data.

69
00:03:39,593 --> 00:03:42,216
A sampling campaign
enabled to collect

70
00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:45,416
soil samples and to
measure the arsenic,

71
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:49,903
cadmium and lead contents,
expressed in parts per million or ppm.

72
00:03:50,468 --> 00:03:52,211
Any analysis of this type begins

73
00:03:52,411 --> 00:03:55,499
by a descriptive characterization
of the dataset,

74
00:03:55,711 --> 00:03:58,424
based on statistical indicators.

75
00:03:58,944 --> 00:03:59,940
Firstly, we need

76
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,615
to get an idea
of ​​the data available,

77
00:04:02,815 --> 00:04:04,565
with the aim of describing

78
00:04:04,765 --> 00:04:07,290
the statistical characteristics
of the variable,

79
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:09,790
to observe if the variable
behaves in a homogeneous way

80
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:12,340
on the whole domain
and also to verify

81
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:16,303
if the variable satisfies
the requirements of the statistical tools

82
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,090
used for regionalization.

83
00:04:19,643 --> 00:04:22,861
We will start
by mapping the sampled domain,

84
00:04:23,061 --> 00:04:26,273
then calculate a number
of statistical indicators

85
00:04:26,473 --> 00:04:29,836
which provide a first view of the 
properties of the measured values.

86
00:04:30,568 --> 00:04:33,453
This step allows to detect 
possible inconsistencies

87
00:04:33,653 --> 00:04:37,078
or outlier values that may result 
from measurement errors.

88
00:04:37,931 --> 00:04:38,855
Here in the table,

89
00:04:39,055 --> 00:04:41,705
observing a maximum variable
for the arsenic,

90
00:04:41,905 --> 00:04:43,368
very far from the average,

91
00:04:43,593 --> 00:04:47,255
suggests the presence of one
or more outlier measures.

92
00:04:56,805 --> 00:04:58,707
The indicators of descriptive
statistics

93
00:04:58,944 --> 00:05:01,419
do not give any indication
on the local behavior

94
00:05:01,632 --> 00:05:04,069
of the interest variable 
on domain D.

95
00:05:04,668 --> 00:05:06,514
They do not take into account
the localization

96
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:09,954
of sampled sites and are only
global indicators.

97
00:05:10,368 --> 00:05:13,445
It is therefore necessary to 
highlight the spatial

98
00:05:13,645 --> 00:05:14,945
and local behavior of the phenomenon,

99
00:05:15,145 --> 00:05:17,345
this is what is called
the variographic cloud

100
00:05:17,545 --> 00:05:20,058
which allows us
to perform this operation.

101
00:05:20,756 --> 00:05:24,307
To study the local variation, 
the principle of the variographic cloud

102
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,469
is to analyze the differences
of values

103
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:29,332
between pairs of sites close, 
then distant,

104
00:05:29,544 --> 00:05:32,607
and then finally between
all the pairs of points in the domain.

105
00:05:33,055 --> 00:05:36,658
One possibility is the calculation
of the difference between pairs of points

106
00:05:36,858 --> 00:05:38,521
and to draw the average,

107
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:40,446
it is the formula that appears in yellow,

108
00:05:40,646 --> 00:05:42,358
at the top, on the right.

109
00:05:42,618 --> 00:05:45,907
Here, Δ (z) can take positive
or negative values

110
00:05:46,107 --> 00:05:48,407
so that the average can be null

111
00:05:48,607 --> 00:05:51,345
independently of the amplitude
of the variation of the variable,

112
00:05:51,745 --> 00:05:55,195
it is therefore not a good indicator
of the behavior of the variable.

113
00:05:55,693 --> 00:05:59,856
On the other hand, the square of the difference
enables to avoid this inconvenience.

114
00:06:00,181 --> 00:06:02,742
We then create the indicator γ*(h)

115
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:06,622
where h is the distance between
the measuring points α and β,

116
00:06:06,835 --> 00:06:08,685
and which is constituted
of squares of differences

117
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:13,010
which we divide by two to express 
the variation on one point only,

118
00:06:13,435 --> 00:06:15,985
this is the quadratic
half-difference.

119
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,100
To analyze the behavior
of all pairs of points,

120
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,250
we use a dispersion diagram
of the quadratic deviations,

121
00:06:22,488 --> 00:06:24,650
actually called variographic cloud.

122
00:06:25,016 --> 00:06:29,541
This diagram shows the values
​​of γ * (h) in relation to h.

123
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:32,804
The pairs of points
are represented only once.

124
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,755
It is important to note
that this approach

125
00:06:34,955 --> 00:06:37,630
does not take into account
the orientation of the pairs of points,

126
00:06:37,905 --> 00:06:41,367
the variographic cloud is said
to be omni-directional.

127
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:54,343
Let's move on to the next step
in the analysis process.

128
00:06:54,543 --> 00:06:57,543
The variographic cloud produced
a large number of pairs

129
00:06:57,743 --> 00:07:00,893
and it is not easy to draw
a teaching on the dispersion

130
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:02,768
of quadratic half-deviations.

131
00:07:03,466 --> 00:07:07,001
This is achieved by segmenting
the domain into distance classes,

132
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:09,051
symbolized here by the orange bars,

133
00:07:09,264 --> 00:07:11,676
similarly to a histogram.

134
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:15,787
A lag Δ (h) is chosen, 

135
00:07:15,987 --> 00:07:19,112
and for each interval
from h (o) to h (n),

136
00:07:19,312 --> 00:07:22,737
we calculate the average of 
the values of γ * (h) 

137
00:07:23,216 --> 00:07:25,455
We will see later
on the basis of which criteria

138
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:28,243
the value of the lag is established.

139
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:31,760
From the moment we consider
an average per distance classes,

140
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:34,797
the quadratic dispersion is 
denoted by γ (h),

141
00:07:34,997 --> 00:07:38,847
without the asterisk, and takes
the name of experimental variogram.

142
00:07:39,429 --> 00:07:40,684
The blue numbers,

143
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:42,959
above the mean points
of the histogram,

144
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:46,696
denote the number of pairs
used for calculation.

145
00:07:47,566 --> 00:07:49,036
The higher the number of pairs,

146
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:51,974
the more representative the lag average is.

147
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,566
A value produced by
too low a number of pairs

148
00:07:54,754 --> 00:07:56,717
is not acceptable
in statistical terms.

149
00:07:56,929 --> 00:07:58,929
In this case, it is necessary to 
increase the size of the lag

150
00:07:59,129 --> 00:08:01,954
so that a larger number
of pairs is included.

151
00:08:02,441 --> 00:08:06,429
The line connecting the points facilitates
the interpretation of the variogram.

152
00:08:07,491 --> 00:08:11,107
The experimental variogram
is characterized by various parameters:

153
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,886
the range is the distance

154
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:15,686
from which the auto-correlation 
disappears,

155
00:08:15,974 --> 00:08:18,686
the bearing is the plane part
of the variogram,

156
00:08:18,886 --> 00:08:21,518
supposed to appear beyond the range,

157
00:08:21,768 --> 00:08:24,284
the nugget is determined
by the intersection

158
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:27,271
of the line of the experimental 
variogram with the ordinate

159
00:08:27,546 --> 00:08:29,521
and the nugget of the variogram
represents

160
00:08:29,734 --> 00:08:32,271
the uncertainty about the 
measurement in each point.

161
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:35,101
The name of nugget
was proposed by Krige

162
00:08:35,301 --> 00:08:36,891
in the context of gold
extraction

163
00:08:37,104 --> 00:08:38,564
in the mines of South Africa,

164
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:40,514
the presence of a nugget
in fact creating

165
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:43,539
a discontinuity
in the density of the ore.

166
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:46,896
A pair of very close measurement
sites produces therefore

167
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:48,979
for one, a very low content,

168
00:08:49,179 --> 00:08:51,217
and for the other,
a very high content,

169
00:08:51,417 --> 00:08:53,654
which produces uncertainty.

170
00:08:53,891 --> 00:08:55,853
Theoretically, the height
of the bearing

171
00:08:56,065 --> 00:08:58,303
corresponds to the variance
of the variable.

172
00:08:58,517 --> 00:09:00,556
If this assumption is respected,

173
00:09:00,756 --> 00:09:05,034
The value of γ (h(x)) can be interpreted
as the uncertainty

174
00:09:05,234 --> 00:09:07,809
which affects a content z estimated of s

175
00:09:08,021 --> 00:09:12,084
and moved away from a distance h(x)
from the nearest point of support.

176
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:15,679
In practice, the coincidence
bearing-variance

177
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:17,479
is not often observed,

178
00:09:17,704 --> 00:09:20,441
but the proposed interpretation
in terms of uncertainty

179
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:22,804
remains valid.

180
00:09:38,029 --> 00:09:39,725
We will now explain

181
00:09:39,925 --> 00:09:42,112
How to take this 
orientation into account.

182
00:09:42,766 --> 00:09:44,215
If the phenomenon manifested

183
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:46,890
a different behavior
according to the orientation,

184
00:09:47,103 --> 00:09:49,453
in other words
if it was anisotropic,

185
00:09:49,653 --> 00:09:53,028
the omni-directional variogram
would not reveal it.

186
00:09:53,254 --> 00:09:56,454
How then do we highlight
such a potential behavior?

187
00:09:57,654 --> 00:10:00,043
Let's do a little
thought experiment to start with

188
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:04,055
in order to visualize an
anisotropic regionalized phenomenon.

189
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,829
The relief of a valley expressed
by the altitude is a good example.

190
00:10:09,129 --> 00:10:11,043
Its behavior is different

191
00:10:11,243 --> 00:10:13,504
if  we observe it in the direction
of the watercourse

192
00:10:13,704 --> 00:10:17,029
or on the contrary
perpendicularly to the latter.

193
00:10:17,517 --> 00:10:20,821
The solution is to represent
the variographic cloud

194
00:10:21,021 --> 00:10:23,246
or the variogram on a diagram

195
00:10:23,446 --> 00:10:26,709
whose axes are the
components h of x and h of y

196
00:10:26,909 --> 00:10:29,721
of the line connecting
the pairs of points.

197
00:10:30,467 --> 00:10:31,907
The values ​​of γ(h)

198
00:10:32,107 --> 00:10:36,882
are carried perpendicularly
to the plan h of x, h of y.

199
00:10:37,442 --> 00:10:40,648
Such a variogram corresponds
to a bivariate histogram.

200
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:43,535
It is called a surface variogram.

201
00:10:44,379 --> 00:10:46,341
The figure here on the screen presents

202
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:49,016
a surface variogram
of the arsenic content

203
00:10:49,216 --> 00:10:51,853
which highlights the main directions
of anisotropy

204
00:10:52,053 --> 00:10:54,128
of its spatial behavior.

205
00:10:54,354 --> 00:10:57,365
The γ(h) values 
are represented in shades of grey

206
00:10:57,565 --> 00:11:00,303
according to the scale on
the right of the image.

207
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:04,417
This variogram is constructed
on the basis of five lags of 20 meters.

208
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:08,829
The arsenic concentration
presents an anisotropic behavior.

209
00:11:09,054 --> 00:11:12,548
It shows a maximum continuity
in the 160 degree direction

210
00:11:12,748 --> 00:11:15,411
and minimum in
the 60 degree direction.

211
00:11:15,754 --> 00:11:17,954
In general,
if the surface variogram

212
00:11:18,154 --> 00:11:20,529
is uniformly distributed
around its center,

213
00:11:20,729 --> 00:11:23,542
the behavior of the variable
is isotropic.

214
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:26,817
The isovalues form concentric circles.

215
00:11:27,204 --> 00:11:30,224
But if the isovalues form
concentric ellipses,

216
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:33,299
there is a geometric anisotropy

217
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:36,161
and the bearing is the same
in all directions.

218
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,451
And if the bearing
is not the same in all the directions,

219
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:41,214
it is then called a zonal anisotropy.

220
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,340
When an anisotropy is
detected,

221
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,215
we calculate variograms 
in the observed directions.

222
00:11:48,429 --> 00:11:50,614
In this case, in order to avoid
a too restricted number

223
00:11:50,814 --> 00:11:54,439
of pairs to be taken into account,
we define an angular tolerance.

224
00:11:55,029 --> 00:11:57,546
We will therefore include all 
the pairs whose orientation

225
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:00,242
is within a main
direction interval

226
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:02,979
more or less a certain
tolerance.

227
00:12:03,279 --> 00:12:06,318
For example, 60 degrees
for the main direction

228
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:08,293
and more or less 20 degrees.

229
00:12:08,592 --> 00:12:11,075
We have represented here
the calculated variograms

230
00:12:11,275 --> 00:12:13,588
on one hand for the direction
of the maximum continuity

231
00:12:13,788 --> 00:12:16,325
of the arsenic concentration, 
160 degrees,

232
00:12:16,525 --> 00:12:19,963
and for its perpendicular 
direction, 60 degrees.

233
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,690
We have seen
that the experimental variogram

234
00:12:33,903 --> 00:12:36,740
enables to express the dependence
between the values measured

235
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,287
between two points
constituting a pair of sites

236
00:12:39,487 --> 00:12:41,837
depending on the distance
between them.

237
00:12:42,242 --> 00:12:44,305
This dependence can be
interpreted

238
00:12:44,505 --> 00:12:47,228
as a weight that we will attribute
to the measurement point

239
00:12:47,428 --> 00:12:48,878
in an interpolation procedure.

240
00:12:49,167 --> 00:12:52,142
So, how do we exploit such a property?

241
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:55,930
To implement the optimal
interpolator

242
00:12:56,130 --> 00:12:58,735
which is the kriging and that we
will present in a moment,

243
00:12:59,547 --> 00:13:01,335
the sampled spatial variables

244
00:13:01,535 --> 00:13:04,547
must be interpreted
in terms of random variables.

245
00:13:05,042 --> 00:13:07,766
However, the constraints fixed
on the random variables

246
00:13:07,966 --> 00:13:10,922
cannot directly exploit
the information provided

247
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:12,722
by the experimental variogram

248
00:13:12,935 --> 00:13:14,833
to match the reality

249
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:17,283
and the solution of the kriging
equations.

250
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:20,551
The experimental variogram
must be adjusted

251
00:13:20,776 --> 00:13:24,325
by a line which can only be
the result of a limited number

252
00:13:24,525 --> 00:13:26,450
of authorized functions

253
00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,563
for the modelling
of the theoretical variogram.

254
00:13:29,917 --> 00:13:33,095
These authorized functions
are the pure nugget model

255
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:35,251
with a γ(h) which is
constant,

256
00:13:35,451 --> 00:13:40,297
the linear model,
the exponential model,

257
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:44,097
the gaussian model
and the spherical model.

258
00:13:44,692 --> 00:13:46,827
The combinations
of these different functions

259
00:13:47,027 --> 00:13:48,527
are also permitted.

260
00:13:49,342 --> 00:13:52,727
However, we must be aware
that only one variogram

261
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:55,460
is defined for the whole
domain and for all the directions,

262
00:13:55,698 --> 00:13:59,210
even if the analysis has highlighted
an anisotropy.

263
00:13:59,567 --> 00:14:02,270
In general, variography softwares

264
00:14:02,483 --> 00:14:04,870
provide an adjustment mode
and calculate the parameters

265
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:07,670
necessary to enable the 
interpolation by kriging.

266
00:14:08,167 --> 00:14:11,791
Here on the screen, we have an example
of a parametrization interface

267
00:14:12,016 --> 00:14:14,591
allowing the adjustment
by a theoretical variogram

268
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,979
of the γ(h) values
by a combination of functions,

269
00:14:18,379 --> 00:14:20,929
so a spherical function
for the first structure

270
00:14:21,129 --> 00:14:23,941
and an exponential function
for the second.

271
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:37,071
Once the various stages
of the structural analysis have been completed,

272
00:14:37,271 --> 00:14:41,121
the results remain to be exploited
by an interpolator capable of drawing

273
00:14:41,321 --> 00:14:44,384
the maximum profits
and that is the kriging.

274
00:14:45,029 --> 00:14:46,677
The problem of kriging
consists in finding

275
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:50,565
the best possible estimate
of the regionalized variable z of s

276
00:14:50,765 --> 00:14:52,815
given the information available,

277
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,721
that is to say given the determined values

278
00:14:55,921 --> 00:14:58,009
in a certain number of samples.

279
00:14:58,767 --> 00:15:00,221
From a theoretical point of view,

280
00:15:00,421 --> 00:15:03,421
the best estimator
is one that satisfies two conditions.

281
00:15:03,767 --> 00:15:06,210
First, being unbiased,

282
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,310
which corresponds to the residuals 
expectation which is zero

283
00:15:09,879 --> 00:15:12,599
Therefore, the mean of the deviations 
between the estimated values

284
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,637
and the measured values ​​is null.

285
00:15:14,917 --> 00:15:17,204
And on the other hand,
to be optimal.

286
00:15:17,404 --> 00:15:20,404
This corresponds to minimizing 
the estimated variance.

287
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:23,395
So the variance of the deviations 
between the estimated value

288
00:15:23,595 --> 00:15:25,458
and the measured value is minimum.

289
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:28,128
This hypothesis enables then

290
00:15:28,353 --> 00:15:31,553
to calculate an estimation
uncertainty on the interpolated sites.

291
00:15:32,129 --> 00:15:34,162
And it is this property
that constitutes

292
00:15:34,362 --> 00:15:36,287
one of the great qualities
of kriging.

293
00:15:37,067 --> 00:15:39,792
The ordinary kriging is used

294
00:15:39,992 --> 00:15:41,567
in the most common situation.

295
00:15:42,017 --> 00:15:44,192
We have a domain
that has been sampled

296
00:15:44,392 --> 00:15:47,654
and whose average can be
considered as constant.

297
00:15:47,979 --> 00:15:49,569
And the variographic study
showed

298
00:15:49,769 --> 00:15:52,569
that the stationarity assumptions
are respected.

299
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:55,603
The mathematical expectation
on the residuals is null

300
00:15:55,803 --> 00:15:58,778
and the corresponding variance
depends only on h.

301
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:02,967
The kriging is a linear
interpolator.

302
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:05,129
The estimated value is a weighted sum

303
00:16:05,342 --> 00:16:08,092
of the values ​​taken
by the sites in its neighborhood.

304
00:16:08,942 --> 00:16:12,068
It is therefore a particular
case of the interpolator,

305
00:16:12,268 --> 00:16:15,481
inverse distance weighting,
which we have already examined.

306
00:16:16,167 --> 00:16:19,122
An estimated value is therefore
produced by the following equation

307
00:16:19,322 --> 00:16:22,334
where γ(α) are the unknowns.

308
00:16:23,117 --> 00:16:24,841
To determine these unknowns,

309
00:16:25,041 --> 00:16:27,185
we must apply
the two equations that define

310
00:16:27,385 --> 00:16:28,697
the properties of kriging,

311
00:16:28,897 --> 00:16:31,022
so an unbiased estimator on one hand

312
00:16:31,222 --> 00:16:33,197
and optimal on the other hand.

313
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:36,263
To begin with, we draw a first 
condition on the weights

314
00:16:36,463 --> 00:16:38,880
from the unbiased property.

315
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,693
This sum of weights must be equal to 1.

316
00:16:41,904 --> 00:16:44,419
In fact, we show that if 
this sum is equal to 1,

317
00:16:44,619 --> 00:16:47,506
it checks the equation
that defines the unbiased condition,

318
00:16:47,731 --> 00:16:50,094
so a residual expectation
that is null.

319
00:16:51,204 --> 00:16:53,430
The estimator must also
be optimal,

320
00:16:53,630 --> 00:16:56,355
so the estimated variance
must be minimal.

321
00:16:56,705 --> 00:17:00,221
This variance is expressed
by the γ(h) variogram 

322
00:17:00,421 --> 00:17:02,821
in accordance with specific
conditions

323
00:17:03,021 --> 00:17:05,333
defined by Matheron in
the theoretical foundations

324
00:17:05,533 --> 00:17:06,670
of the structural analysis

325
00:17:06,896 --> 00:17:09,696
but in the details of which
we will not go here.

326
00:17:09,934 --> 00:17:14,114
The important thing
is to remember where here in red

327
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:16,952
the information produced
by the variogram

328
00:17:17,152 --> 00:17:18,264
intervenes in the equation

329
00:17:18,477 --> 00:17:20,752
which allows to minimize
the estimated variance.

330
00:17:21,227 --> 00:17:23,523
The estimated minimum
variance is reached

331
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:26,835
when its derivative
compared to the weight is null.

332
00:17:27,123 --> 00:17:28,760
The first step
to solve the equation

333
00:17:28,973 --> 00:17:30,910
is therefore to calculate
its derivative.

334
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:33,873
And the final solution requires
a particular method

335
00:17:34,098 --> 00:17:35,935
based on Lagrange parameters

336
00:17:36,135 --> 00:17:38,973
and its developments
are not presented here.

337
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,585
In synthesis, the kriging
owes its robustness to the fact

338
00:17:42,798 --> 00:17:45,223
that its functioning
is conditioned by parameters

339
00:17:45,423 --> 00:17:47,323
produced by the variogram.

340
00:17:47,548 --> 00:17:49,537
The two conditions
that we have just analyzed

341
00:17:49,737 --> 00:17:52,549
allow primarily
to define the weighting

342
00:17:52,749 --> 00:17:55,587
related to the distance that characterizes
the measurement points.

343
00:17:55,787 --> 00:17:59,855
And ultimately to infer
intermediate values.

344
00:18:08,668 --> 00:18:11,973
The structural analysis, 
of which the main component

345
00:18:12,173 --> 00:18:15,736
is the variogram is a prerequisite
to any interpolation procedure.

346
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:18,557
The latter is arbitrary
in the absence of a structure,

347
00:18:18,757 --> 00:18:20,607
that is to say in the absence
of the existence

348
00:18:20,819 --> 00:18:23,332
of a predictable behavior
of the variable

349
00:18:23,532 --> 00:18:25,232
between two measurement sites.

350
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:27,031
This structural analysis consists

351
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,280
in developping an experimental
variogram on the basis

352
00:18:29,468 --> 00:18:31,819
of the difference of the measured contents

353
00:18:32,019 --> 00:18:34,219
between all the pairs
of sampling sites

354
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:36,644
and distributed in distance
classes.

355
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:39,684
It is then the adjustment
of a theoretical model

356
00:18:39,884 --> 00:18:41,359
to these empirical values

357
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:43,509
which will provide
useful parameters

358
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:45,934
to kriging interpolation
calculations.

359
00:18:46,882 --> 00:18:49,357
The chosen approach in this
lesson as an introduction

360
00:18:49,557 --> 00:18:52,194
to the variography is of a 
strictly empirical nature.

361
00:18:52,744 --> 00:18:54,794
This approach is well-founded
because it involves

362
00:18:54,994 --> 00:18:57,069
simple but established knowledge.

363
00:18:57,357 --> 00:18:59,836
Nevertheless, you will undoubtedly 
have noticed

364
00:19:00,036 --> 00:19:03,036
that it is based on assumptions
which have not been mentioned

365
00:19:03,236 --> 00:19:05,335
and which do not fit into any

366
00:19:05,548 --> 00:19:07,360
complete and rigorous mathematical theory

367
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,310
likely to explain in particular

368
00:19:09,510 --> 00:19:12,260
how to model the dependence
between measurement sites

369
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,723
highlighted by the experimental
variogram.

370
00:19:16,006 --> 00:19:18,419
The theoretical foundations
of the structural analysis

371
00:19:18,619 --> 00:19:21,619
have been developed by
Matheron and we refer you to references

372
00:19:21,819 --> 00:19:25,256
indicated on the web pages
of this MOOC for more information.
