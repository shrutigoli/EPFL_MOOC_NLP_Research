00:00:31,483 --> 00:00:33,412
Hello and welcome to this lesson

2
00:00:33,611 --> 00:00:36,611
on a measure of the global
spatial auto-correlation,

3
00:00:36,788 --> 00:00:38,093
the I of Moran.

4
00:00:38,374 --> 00:00:41,729
An auto-correlation index allows to
quantify the regularity

5
00:00:41,904 --> 00:00:44,833
or the structure of a spatially
distributed phenomenon

6
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:48,553
by taking into account the
neighborhood of each of the individuals

7
00:00:48,732 --> 00:00:51,103
which constitute the geodataset.

8
00:00:51,514 --> 00:00:54,587
We will see how to take 
this neighborhood

9
00:00:54,765 --> 00:00:57,492
into account in order to develop
spatial weighting schemes.

10
00:00:57,923 --> 00:01:00,398
These diagrams are absolutely necessary

11
00:01:00,598 --> 00:01:02,873
to calculate an index such 
as the I of Moran

12
00:01:03,133 --> 00:01:06,739
and at the same time to estimate the
scope of the spatial dependence.

13
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:08,422
You will finally learn

14
00:01:08,594 --> 00:01:11,463
how to assess the significance
of this index.

15
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:15,811
The aims of this lesson are
to pass on the notions

16
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:18,809
necessary for the calculation of
a spatial auto-correlation index.

17
00:01:19,247 --> 00:01:21,278
We will present the information useful

18
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:23,970
for the definition of spatial
weighting schemes

19
00:01:24,294 --> 00:01:26,543
and explain the I of Moran index,

20
00:01:26,837 --> 00:01:30,074
in particular its interpretation as
a regression coefficient

21
00:01:30,476 --> 00:01:33,476
which provides an intuitive and
easy to remember approach.

22
00:01:34,883 --> 00:01:36,831
After following our explanations,

23
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:40,868
you should be able to determine
a spatial weighting mode

24
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:44,169
that is adapted to the analyzed datasets.

25
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:48,207
And you should also be able
to calculate the global I of Moran 

26
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:50,096
as well as its significance

27
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:53,811
for any punctual or surface geodataset.

28
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,496
We present in this lesson

29
00:01:56,687 --> 00:02:00,507
the concepts required to calculate
a global auto-correlation indicator.

30
00:02:01,345 --> 00:02:02,906
It is in fact a unique index

31
00:02:03,093 --> 00:02:06,728
which characterizes the spatial
arrangement of the geographical units

32
00:02:06,934 --> 00:02:08,734
according to the values 
of a given attribute

33
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:11,827
and this on the whole of 
an analyzed territory.

34
00:02:12,246 --> 00:02:14,239
There are several measurement methods:

35
00:02:14,408 --> 00:02:18,310
the Join Count Analysis which is
an enumeration statistic

36
00:02:18,658 --> 00:02:22,291
and has the particularity of being
applicable only to polygons.

37
00:02:22,974 --> 00:02:26,967
And amongst the others, we find the
C of Geary, the K of Ripley

38
00:02:27,998 --> 00:02:31,785
the G of Getis-Ord and
finally the I of Moran

39
00:02:32,003 --> 00:02:35,077
which is the most widespread and
which is the subject of this lesson.

40
00:02:44,419 --> 00:02:46,130
To quantify the spatial dependence

41
00:02:46,321 --> 00:02:48,889
and generate a global spatial
auto-correlation measure,

42
00:02:49,421 --> 00:02:51,601
it is necessary to take the 
neighborhood 

43
00:02:51,767 --> 00:02:54,337
of each of the geographical
objects considered into account.

44
00:02:54,664 --> 00:02:57,176
Indeed the measure of the
global auto-correlation

45
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:59,916
consists in comparing
the behavior of an object

46
00:03:00,162 --> 00:03:02,127
with the behavior of its neighbors

47
00:03:02,326 --> 00:03:04,643
and this on all the territory studied.

48
00:03:05,364 --> 00:03:09,626
The key being to define this neighborhood
according to different possible criteria.

49
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:13,186
Let's take for example this
group of 54 points

50
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:14,699
which represents in this case

51
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:17,374
the mass centers or the district centroids

52
00:03:17,586 --> 00:03:21,210
for which we decide to define
an neighborhood of 5km.

53
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:24,249
The white circle identifies 
the object 1

54
00:03:24,433 --> 00:03:27,177
and the yellow circle defines
a radius of 5km

55
00:03:27,347 --> 00:03:29,335
around the latter.

56
00:03:29,609 --> 00:03:32,704
The neighborhood is defined
here by this radius of 5 km.

57
00:03:33,693 --> 00:03:37,461
It then allows to compare the value 
of an attribute A of the object 1

58
00:03:37,642 --> 00:03:39,842
with a statistic of this attribute A

59
00:03:40,018 --> 00:03:42,476
for the 17 objects highlighted in green

60
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:44,750
and situated in this neighborhood.

61
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:49,317
This statistic can be the average
as is the case with the I of Moran.

62
00:03:49,618 --> 00:03:50,768
This operation is repeated

63
00:03:50,966 --> 00:03:53,568
so as to be able to compare
the attribute A of each object

64
00:03:53,768 --> 00:03:58,041
with the average attribute A of its
neighborhood, so 54 times here.

65
00:03:59,989 --> 00:04:02,147
There are several criteria
on which to base ourselves

66
00:04:02,327 --> 00:04:04,938
to define the neighborhood 
of a geographic object.

67
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:08,595
And we will use the GeoDa
software interface here

68
00:04:08,855 --> 00:04:11,464
to illustrate the implementation
of these criteria.

69
00:04:12,372 --> 00:04:15,235
The options available
to define a criterion

70
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,242
depend partly on the type
of object considered.

71
00:04:19,365 --> 00:04:22,879
When we want to define the
neighborhood of punctual objects,

72
00:04:23,092 --> 00:04:25,228
The most frequently used criteria

73
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:27,849
are to be based either on a distance

74
00:04:28,027 --> 00:04:30,081
or on a proximity criterion

75
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,290
which consists of identifying
the K nearest neighbors.

76
00:04:33,892 --> 00:04:35,647
Regarding the first option,

77
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:39,355
the distance or radius
used here is 5000 m

78
00:04:39,559 --> 00:04:41,874
and takes up the example used earlier.

79
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,188
In this case, the neighborhood is defined
only on the basis of the distance

80
00:04:46,356 --> 00:04:48,228
between the point and its neighbors

81
00:04:48,444 --> 00:04:50,894
and constitutes what is
called a fixed core.

82
00:04:51,099 --> 00:04:53,167
The distance D of 5000 m

83
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:55,932
is called the bandwidth.

84
00:04:56,121 --> 00:05:00,502
In the case of the nearest neighbors, 
here K is equal to 7,

85
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:03,745
the neighborhood is adjusted depending 
on the density of objects

86
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,382
around the point.

87
00:05:05,612 --> 00:05:09,347
And we then say that the associated
function uses a variable core.

88
00:05:10,398 --> 00:05:12,750
The surface objects or polygons

89
00:05:12,919 --> 00:05:14,035
allow in addition to play

90
00:05:14,217 --> 00:05:17,142
on the adjacency or 
contiguity relations.

91
00:05:17,411 --> 00:05:20,979
There are 2 types of adjacency
relations: the Queen and Rook types

92
00:05:21,233 --> 00:05:24,605
that refer to the movements
of pieces in a chess game.

93
00:05:25,262 --> 00:05:28,783
The Queen type, so the queen
moving in all directions,

94
00:05:29,248 --> 00:05:31,874
corresponds to a neighborhood
that includes all the polygons

95
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:33,558
that touch the polygon of interest,

96
00:05:33,752 --> 00:05:36,752
at least one pair of coordinates
in common is required.

97
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:39,456
The Rook type, so the rook

98
00:05:39,662 --> 00:05:43,082
that moves only North, South, 
East and West,

99
00:05:43,489 --> 00:05:45,901
corresponds to a neighborhood 
that includes all the polygons

100
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:49,518
that have at least 1 common side
with the polygon of interest.

101
00:05:49,995 --> 00:05:53,076
This type of adjacency
relation is mainly used

102
00:05:53,257 --> 00:05:56,382
in the case where geographic
units are orthogonal polygons

103
00:05:57,517 --> 00:06:00,517
like many counties in the
United States for example.

104
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:04,321
There is also a parameter which
is the order of contiguity.

105
00:06:04,524 --> 00:06:07,792
Indeed, we can take into account the
immediately contiguous neighbors

106
00:06:08,036 --> 00:06:11,036
as is the case here in yellow
around the polygon E

107
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:14,216
which corresponds to
an order of contiguity 1,

108
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,683
but we can also define a neighborhood

109
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:19,145
which rests on an order of contiguity 2,

110
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:21,380
here designated by the green arrows,

111
00:06:21,549 --> 00:06:26,211
that is to say to include the polygons
which, depending on the Queen or Rook type,

112
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:29,235
are neighbors of the polygons of order 1.

113
00:06:29,595 --> 00:06:32,983
Finally, according to the characteristics
of the current analysis,

114
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,015
it is possible to include or not
in the neighborhood

115
00:06:36,422 --> 00:06:39,091
the orders of contiguity 
of lower rank.

116
00:06:39,299 --> 00:06:41,424
The fixed cores like the distance,

117
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:44,296
the variable cores like the
K nearest neighbors

118
00:06:44,486 --> 00:06:45,698
are applicable to the polygons,

119
00:06:45,886 --> 00:06:48,624
but it is in this case the
geographical coordinates

120
00:06:48,784 --> 00:06:50,994
of the geometric center of
gravity of the object

121
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,199
that are taken into account for
the calculation.

122
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:55,505
This is also the case

123
00:06:55,699 --> 00:06:58,135
when working with linear objects.

124
00:07:07,392 --> 00:07:08,967
The neighborhood relations

125
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,246
allow to determine the
spatial weighting scheme

126
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:13,799
that we want to apply to a dataset.

127
00:07:15,158 --> 00:07:18,158
This weighting scheme will
be applied to create a file

128
00:07:18,696 --> 00:07:21,458
containing for each object
the list of its neighbors.

129
00:07:22,502 --> 00:07:25,096
This is the spatial weighting file.

130
00:07:26,365 --> 00:07:28,804
This is what we can read
when we edit this file.

131
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:32,995
Here we take the example of
the 54 districts used previously.

132
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:35,762
The first line is the header

133
00:07:35,952 --> 00:07:38,635
and contains 4 elements
separated by a space.

134
00:07:38,999 --> 00:07:42,357
The 0 that has no function in the
current version of GeoDa,

135
00:07:42,555 --> 00:07:46,141
54 which designates the number
of polygons in the dataset,

136
00:07:46,445 --> 00:07:49,718
the file name and the name of
the unique identifier.

137
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:53,766
The rest of the file lists the
neighbors of each polygon.

138
00:07:54,212 --> 00:07:57,300
In line 2, the number 1 designates
the polygon number 1

139
00:07:57,494 --> 00:08:00,596
and the number 6 indicates that
this polygon has 6 neighbors

140
00:08:00,785 --> 00:08:02,175
according to the indicated criterion

141
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:06,763
and that it is the polygons
number 35 - 29 - 13 - 4 - 3 and 2

142
00:08:07,274 --> 00:08:09,046
that are indicated in line 3.

143
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:12,689
And so on, at line 4, polygon
2 has 5 neighbors

144
00:08:12,946 --> 00:08:16,035
that are polygons 9 - 8 - 4 - 3 and 1.

145
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,749
With the criterion of the
K nearest neighbors

146
00:08:18,915 --> 00:08:20,131
illustrated on the right,

147
00:08:20,354 --> 00:08:22,109
after the header, the file contains

148
00:08:22,287 --> 00:08:24,707
the 7 nearest neighbors of polygon 1

149
00:08:24,891 --> 00:08:28,016
with on the right the distance
that separates the centroids

150
00:08:28,222 --> 00:08:29,645
and then from line 9,

151
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:32,816
the 7 nearest neighbors
of polygon 2, and so on.

152
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:45,322
The spatial auto-correlation is quantified
by the calculation of a correlation

153
00:08:45,553 --> 00:08:48,855
between the measurements geographically
adjacent to a measured phenomenon.

154
00:08:49,324 --> 00:08:51,947
With the I of Moran, we calculate 
the correlation

155
00:08:52,129 --> 00:08:54,705
between the analyzed attribute
of a geographical object

156
00:08:54,877 --> 00:08:58,518
and the mean of this attribute
calculated within the defined neighborhood.

157
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:02,529
We will therefore use the contiguity
spatial weighting file

158
00:09:02,732 --> 00:09:03,925
described earlier

159
00:09:04,205 --> 00:09:06,030
to calculate the mean of this attribute

160
00:09:06,217 --> 00:09:09,630
in the neighborhood of each of the 
objects constituting the dataset.

161
00:09:10,402 --> 00:09:13,590
The variable Z that we use in this example

162
00:09:13,772 --> 00:09:17,463
represents the monthly average
of the sum of precipitations

163
00:09:17,668 --> 00:09:20,554
expressed in tenths of a millimeter
per district.

164
00:09:20,799 --> 00:09:24,647
This variable Z is the third column
of the table

165
00:09:24,848 --> 00:09:28,435
after the IDE identifier and
the list of adjacent polygons

166
00:09:28,607 --> 00:09:32,392
which allows to calculate
the average of Z in the last column.

167
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,225
The neighbors listed in the second column

168
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:37,326
allow to determine ω,

169
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,606
so the weight attributed to the polygons

170
00:09:39,794 --> 00:09:43,036
in the calculation of the average
of Z in the neighborhood.

171
00:09:43,229 --> 00:09:45,073
In the case of the contiguity criterion,

172
00:09:45,272 --> 00:09:47,625
this weight is 1 if a 
polygon is adjacent

173
00:09:47,807 --> 00:09:49,611
and 0 if it is not.

174
00:09:50,252 --> 00:09:53,067
The I of Moran auto-correlation 
coefficient

175
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:56,717
Is an extension of the Bravais-Pearson
correlation coefficient.

176
00:09:57,013 --> 00:10:00,754
It expresses the importance of
the difference in the values ​​of a variable

177
00:10:00,947 --> 00:10:03,747
between all the pairs of neighboring
geographical objects.

178
00:10:04,002 --> 00:10:07,002
It is defined as shown here 
in the formula

179
00:10:07,193 --> 00:10:10,080
by the ratio between the covariance
of a variable,

180
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:12,384
in relation to the average 
of this variable

181
00:10:12,621 --> 00:10:15,060
and its variance on all 
the studied area.

182
00:10:15,551 --> 00:10:18,651
It is a measure of the linear
correlation between 2 variables,

183
00:10:18,853 --> 00:10:20,611
so Z and Z bar here,

184
00:10:20,814 --> 00:10:24,303
and produces a value between +1 and -1

185
00:10:24,482 --> 00:10:27,719
where 1 means that there is a
total positive correlation,

186
00:10:28,231 --> 00:10:30,229
0 no correlation

187
00:10:30,538 --> 00:10:34,225
and -1 negative or inverse
total correlation.

188
00:10:35,996 --> 00:10:40,450
In 1996, Luc Anselin proposed an
interpretation of the I of Moran

189
00:10:40,637 --> 00:10:42,711
as a regression coefficient.

190
00:10:43,238 --> 00:10:47,008
This interpretation allows to fully
understand the calculation of the I of Moran

191
00:10:47,187 --> 00:10:49,050
via the exploratory statistical tools

192
00:10:49,236 --> 00:10:51,597
implemented in the GeoDa software.

193
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,243
We will implement it

194
00:10:53,438 --> 00:10:56,675
by calculating the I of Moran on
the precipitation variable

195
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:59,861
which characterizes the 54 
districts of our dataset.

196
00:11:00,565 --> 00:11:02,727
We will use the same weighting scheme,

197
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,707
so a variable core with a
Queen contiguity order of 1.

198
00:11:07,513 --> 00:11:10,623
The I of Moran formula is equivalent
to calculating the correlation

199
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,524
between the precipitation value for
each district,

200
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:15,820
it is the variable z in the table,

201
00:11:16,026 --> 00:11:19,366
and the average of the precipitations
for the neighbors of each district,

202
00:11:19,605 --> 00:11:22,605
it is the variable z bar in the table.

203
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:25,978
By applying a regression of the
independent variable Z

204
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:28,309
on the dependent variable Z bar

205
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:31,951
the slope of the regression line
is equal to the I of Moran.

206
00:11:32,623 --> 00:11:35,236
By means of a bivariate scatter plot,

207
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:38,968
this interpretation provides a means
of visualizing the linear relation

208
00:11:39,148 --> 00:11:40,740
between the studied variable

209
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,920
and the average value of this
variable in its neighborhood.

210
00:11:44,998 --> 00:11:49,297
Here, the beta parameter,
so the slope, is equal to 0.79.

211
00:11:49,721 --> 00:11:51,412
The scatter plot of Moran

212
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:55,286
shows the same relation but on
the centered and reduced values.

213
00:11:56,391 --> 00:11:59,203
This high I of Moran shows that
the precipitation values

214
00:11:59,376 --> 00:12:01,214
on the districts of this territory

215
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,213
resemble the average of their neighbors

216
00:12:03,408 --> 00:12:05,650
and that there is therefore a
spatial auto-correlation,

217
00:12:06,314 --> 00:12:08,430
that the precipitation variable used

218
00:12:08,615 --> 00:12:10,905
is therefore spatially dependent.

219
00:12:12,287 --> 00:12:16,065
This thematic map of the
precipitation variable in 5 places

220
00:12:16,511 --> 00:12:19,864
highlights the spatial structure
revealed by the I of Moran.

221
00:12:20,414 --> 00:12:21,329
Indeed,

222
00:12:21,554 --> 00:12:24,230
the intensity of precipitations
declines progressively

223
00:12:24,422 --> 00:12:26,197
from East to West.

224
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:36,204
But is this spatial 
auto-correlation value

225
00:12:36,406 --> 00:12:38,759
statistically significant?

226
00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:40,398
Indeed, to what extent

227
00:12:40,575 --> 00:12:43,111
is the spatial arrangement of the
precipitation variable

228
00:12:43,295 --> 00:12:45,522
not due to chance?

229
00:12:47,176 --> 00:12:48,664
How does the situation observed,

230
00:12:48,853 --> 00:12:53,008
so the spatial structure revealed by
the I of Moran of 0.79,

231
00:12:53,437 --> 00:12:55,816
behave if we compare it,

232
00:12:56,021 --> 00:12:57,753
if not to all possible configurations,

233
00:12:57,954 --> 00:13:00,523
in any case to a large part of them?

234
00:13:01,396 --> 00:13:03,004
By possible configuration,

235
00:13:03,169 --> 00:13:06,385
we think about changing 
the values randomly,

236
00:13:07,298 --> 00:13:09,348
we have used here a fictitious variable

237
00:13:09,537 --> 00:13:12,685
with values ​​between 1 and 54
to illustrate the method,

238
00:13:13,649 --> 00:13:15,809
between all the other possible locations

239
00:13:15,989 --> 00:13:17,730
in the analyzed dataset.

240
00:13:18,252 --> 00:13:21,252
Each configuration corresponds
to a random draw.

241
00:13:21,586 --> 00:13:23,969
And we proceed to several
thousand of permutations

242
00:13:24,172 --> 00:13:26,581
in the case of the Monte Carlo method.

243
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:28,238
with each draw,

244
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,693
we calculate the I of Moran

245
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:32,768
which we compared with the I of Moran
of the observed situation.

246
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:36,558
After 999 prints, we have 999
configurations

247
00:13:36,764 --> 00:13:38,887
and as many I of Moran values ​​to compare

248
00:13:39,172 --> 00:13:40,452
with the observed situation,

249
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:43,009
which allows to know
if the latter resembles

250
00:13:43,184 --> 00:13:44,959
the random configurations

251
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,629
or if, on the contrary, it is clearly
different.

252
00:13:48,757 --> 00:13:51,788
The Geoda software will store
the I of Moran corresponding

253
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:54,298
to all the random configurations generated

254
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:57,051
and use them to construct a histogram.

255
00:13:57,439 --> 00:14:00,155
On the basis of actual precipitation
data per district,

256
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:04,087
here is the histogram generated
on the basis of 99 prints,

257
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:06,013
then 999,

258
00:14:06,437 --> 00:14:11,187
of 9,999 and finally of 99,999
random draws

259
00:14:11,405 --> 00:14:14,075
out of a possible total of 54 factorials.

260
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,363
The higher the number of prints, the
more normal the distribution appears

261
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:20,757
and the more the standard
deviation and the mean are supposed

262
00:14:20,924 --> 00:14:22,974
to approach their theoretical values.

263
00:14:23,239 --> 00:14:24,877
Let's now look in detail

264
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:29,143
at the histogram generated
on the basis of 999 permutations.

265
00:14:30,288 --> 00:14:33,025
The random distribution represents
what can be called

266
00:14:33,197 --> 00:14:34,385
the neutral space.

267
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:35,897
Around the average,

268
00:14:36,063 --> 00:14:38,215
which is shown here and which
is close to 0,

269
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,453
the precipitation values ​​of the districts

270
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,825
do not resemble the average of
their neighbors.

271
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:45,155
And we see that the value of
the I of Moran

272
00:14:45,337 --> 00:14:48,834
for the situation observed here
indicated by the yellow line,

273
00:14:49,024 --> 00:14:51,393
and this yellow line is not
a histogram bar,

274
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:54,290
is clearly distinguished from
the rest of the distribution.

275
00:14:54,488 --> 00:14:57,061
It is therefore apparently significant.

276
00:14:57,240 --> 00:14:58,941
A non-significant value

277
00:14:59,145 --> 00:15:01,463
would appear as here 
in green, for example,

278
00:15:01,656 --> 00:15:03,995
so in the middle of the
neutral distribution,

279
00:15:04,171 --> 00:15:06,632
where there is no spatial dependence.

280
00:15:07,982 --> 00:15:10,445
This significance is translated
numerically

281
00:15:10,635 --> 00:15:13,369
by a probability of rejecting
the null hypothesis.

282
00:15:13,558 --> 00:15:17,589
The p-value is a limit value of 
rejection of the null hypothesis.

283
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:19,227
And the null hypothesis here,

284
00:15:19,425 --> 00:15:22,100
is that the value observed is
the fact of chance

285
00:15:22,295 --> 00:15:23,278
and it resembles

286
00:15:23,469 --> 00:15:26,235
the other values ​​generated by
random permutation.

287
00:15:26,812 --> 00:15:28,400
The lower the p-value,

288
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:29,923
the weaker the risk of making a mistake

289
00:15:30,096 --> 00:15:31,970
by rejecting this null hypothesis,

290
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,234
so, the higher the observed
value is significantly different

291
00:15:35,397 --> 00:15:37,425
from a random distribution.

292
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:39,441
This p-value,

293
00:15:39,609 --> 00:15:42,922
is the ratio between the randomly
generated number of I of Moran

294
00:15:43,121 --> 00:15:45,848
which are larger or equal
than the observed I of Moran

295
00:15:46,025 --> 00:15:50,706
plus 1 and the total number
of random permutations plus 1.

296
00:15:51,499 --> 00:15:54,248
As the I of Moran can also be negative,

297
00:15:54,448 --> 00:15:57,011
the determination of the p-value
will in this case be based

298
00:15:57,194 --> 00:15:59,319
on the number of randomly
generated I of Moran

299
00:15:59,489 --> 00:16:02,791
which are smaller or equal
than the observed I of Moran.

300
00:16:04,437 --> 00:16:07,957
We speak in the case of this
test of pseudo p-value

301
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:12,120
because the threshold of significance
depends on the number of permutations.

302
00:16:13,309 --> 00:16:14,555
In the present case,

303
00:16:14,786 --> 00:16:17,356
we can conclude that the
analyzed precipitation variable

304
00:16:17,551 --> 00:16:21,569
is spatially or globally significantly
auto-correlated.

305
00:16:31,428 --> 00:16:32,520
We will see now

306
00:16:32,698 --> 00:16:35,063
how to generate a spatial weighting file,

307
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:36,567
to calculate the global I of Moran

308
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:39,680
and to evaluate its significance with GeoDa.

309
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:43,101
First, we need to open a file in
shape format

310
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:45,311
which contains the polygons
of the districts

311
00:16:45,477 --> 00:16:49,167
and their attributes including
our precipitation variable.

312
00:16:50,671 --> 00:16:53,421
Next, we have to create 
the spatial weighting file

313
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:57,192
by clicking on the create weights button.

314
00:16:58,598 --> 00:17:00,709
And in the corresponding dialogue box,

315
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:03,317
we must first select an unique identifier,

316
00:17:03,507 --> 00:17:04,860
here IDE,

317
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,459
then select the desired weighting scheme,

318
00:17:09,263 --> 00:17:12,595
so a Queen contiguity
criterion of 1.

319
00:17:14,013 --> 00:17:16,552
After clicking the create button,

320
00:17:16,991 --> 00:17:21,261
we have to choose
where to store this weighting file

321
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:24,962
and give it a name to identify it.

322
00:17:27,006 --> 00:17:30,006
Then we will inspect the connectivity.

323
00:17:30,399 --> 00:17:33,624
We will use the connectivity
histogram button

324
00:17:33,991 --> 00:17:37,103
which allows us to inspect the
connectivity histogram,

325
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:41,510
so to give us an indication of
the frequency of polygons

326
00:17:42,006 --> 00:17:44,715
having the number of neighbors
indicated in the X axis.

327
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,860
Thus, it is possible to highlight

328
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,049
the best connected district here

329
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,981
or the seven least
connected districts

330
00:17:54,422 --> 00:17:56,469
which are located in the edges
of the zone.

331
00:17:57,739 --> 00:18:00,964
Let's now take a look in
the weighting file.

332
00:18:01,145 --> 00:18:02,438
So this weighting file,

333
00:18:02,605 --> 00:18:06,035
we can open it with a text editor

334
00:18:07,945 --> 00:18:10,228
and we find the structure 
presented earlier

335
00:18:10,412 --> 00:18:12,295
with the header on the first line

336
00:18:12,532 --> 00:18:15,112
then the description of the
neighborhood of the polygon 1

337
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:16,833
which has 6 neighbors,

338
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,952
then the polygon 2, which counts 5,

339
00:18:20,206 --> 00:18:24,029
and the polygon 3, which also counts 5,
and so on.

340
00:18:25,353 --> 00:18:26,878
We will now start

341
00:18:27,051 --> 00:18:29,673
calculating the I of Moran.

342
00:18:29,998 --> 00:18:32,160
We must select the variable
of interest to begin with

343
00:18:32,342 --> 00:18:36,367
and it is Z which refers to the
monthly precipitation.

344
00:18:37,162 --> 00:18:39,812
The scatter plot of Moran is
generated immediately

345
00:18:39,994 --> 00:18:41,572
since we had already

346
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,465
generated the weighting file
earlier and it was loaded.

347
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,141
It shows us the cloud of
centered and reduced values

348
00:18:50,324 --> 00:18:53,532
and above an I of Moran of 0.79.

349
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:57,758
Then, it is quickly possible
to test the significance

350
00:18:57,945 --> 00:18:59,758
by right-clicking on the scatter plot

351
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,401
and by clicking on randomization.

352
00:19:02,601 --> 00:19:07,634
And we will generate 9,999 random
spatial configurations.

353
00:19:08,886 --> 00:19:12,130
The corresponding histogram shows us here

354
00:19:12,336 --> 00:19:15,356
a very small p-value which means

355
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:19,014
that we are unlikely to be wrong by
rejecting the null hypothesis,

356
00:19:19,569 --> 00:19:22,681
and that the spatial structure observed
and characterized

357
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:26,365
by an I of Moran of 0.79 is 
significantly different

358
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:28,677
from a random spatial distribution.

359
00:19:29,896 --> 00:19:31,846
Each time we click the run button,

360
00:19:32,318 --> 00:19:36,170
we regenerate a series of 9,999
random permutations

361
00:19:36,639 --> 00:19:38,410
with different statistics.

362
00:19:38,928 --> 00:19:42,433
But we realize that the pseudo
p-value remains very small.

363
00:19:43,240 --> 00:19:47,204
Finally, we will calculate 
the I of Moran again,

364
00:19:47,391 --> 00:19:49,316
but according to Luc Anselin's
interpretation,

365
00:19:49,517 --> 00:19:52,139
so to construct a linear regression

366
00:19:52,364 --> 00:19:55,176
between the precipitation 
variable Z on the X axis

367
00:19:55,589 --> 00:19:59,081
and the weighted precipitation 
variable Z bar on the Y axis.

368
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:04,147
And we note that indeed
the beta coefficient

369
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:08,298
which gives the slope of the 
regression line is equal to 0.79

370
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:12,620
and that by standardizing the
two distributions

371
00:20:12,802 --> 00:20:15,823
of precipitation expressed in
tenth of millimeters of water,

372
00:20:16,102 --> 00:20:19,720
we reach the scatter plot of Moran
obtained directly earlier.

373
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:22,875
In this lesson,

374
00:20:23,054 --> 00:20:25,760
you have learned to determine the
neighborhood of geographic objects

375
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:28,014
using a number of criteria.

376
00:20:28,986 --> 00:20:30,519
It is important to ask

377
00:20:30,694 --> 00:20:32,199
wether data with which we are working

378
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,755
are rather adapted to a fixed
core or a variable core.

379
00:20:36,251 --> 00:20:38,308
And in the case where we work
with polygons,

380
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:41,233
what order of contiguity should be used?

381
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:44,895
The definition of the neighborhood

382
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:47,604
determines the spatial weighting scheme

383
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,595
and this determination of
the spatial weighting scheme

384
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:54,494
is a key step in the evaluation
of spatial auto-correlation.

385
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:58,356
This step allows you to circumscribe

386
00:20:58,556 --> 00:21:00,712
the area whose behavior will be compared

387
00:21:00,971 --> 00:21:02,998
with that of each geographical object.

388
00:21:03,983 --> 00:21:05,172
And it is this comparison

389
00:21:05,343 --> 00:21:08,783
that is made by calculating the correlation

390
00:21:08,986 --> 00:21:12,197
between the distribution of the
variable of interest for each object

391
00:21:12,386 --> 00:21:13,888
and the distribution of the mean

392
00:21:14,088 --> 00:21:16,793
of this variable in the neighborhood
of each object.

393
00:21:17,267 --> 00:21:18,675
This is the I of Moran.

394
00:21:19,313 --> 00:21:22,651
Finally, to estimate the
significance of this index

395
00:21:22,894 --> 00:21:25,851
you have learned how to generate
random permutations,

396
00:21:26,132 --> 00:21:27,998
with the help of the Monte Carlo method.
