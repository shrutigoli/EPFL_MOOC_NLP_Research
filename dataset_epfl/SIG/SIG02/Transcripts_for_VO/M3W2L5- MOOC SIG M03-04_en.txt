00:00:21,974 --> 00:00:23,937
Hello and welcome to this lesson

2
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:26,150
which will be on the pollution
of the water plan

3
00:00:26,349 --> 00:00:27,762
of the Ebrié lagoon system

4
00:00:27,962 --> 00:00:30,975
and more specifically on the area
that surrounds the agglomeration

5
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:31,987
of Abidjan

6
00:00:32,187 --> 00:00:33,799
that has been subjected for some years

7
00:00:33,999 --> 00:00:36,774
to uncontrolled and increasing
domestic

8
00:00:36,974 --> 00:00:37,999
and industrial wastes.

9
00:00:38,299 --> 00:00:40,149
This lesson which is a case study,

10
00:00:40,349 --> 00:00:41,662
shows how the tools

11
00:00:41,862 --> 00:00:43,237
here can be exploited

12
00:00:43,437 --> 00:00:45,462
or how to map the pollution levels

13
00:00:45,662 --> 00:00:46,724
by heavy metals

14
00:00:46,899 --> 00:00:48,074
of a lagooned stretch of water

15
00:00:48,274 --> 00:00:49,949
which presents a sanitization deficit.

16
00:00:50,349 --> 00:00:52,487
In this specific case that we
present to you

17
00:00:52,687 --> 00:00:55,387
we use the results of geochemical
analysis of sediments

18
00:00:55,587 --> 00:00:57,724
collected on the ground in 2001

19
00:00:57,924 --> 00:01:01,212
by the Professor Affian and his
team of marine geosciences of CURAT

20
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:03,962
and one of the current
challenges of the ivorian authorities

21
00:01:04,162 --> 00:01:05,999
is the restoration of
this stretch of water

22
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,049
in order to regain its previous state

23
00:01:08,249 --> 00:01:09,224
from before the 70s

24
00:01:09,424 --> 00:01:11,537
which had the name of
"pearl of the lagoons."

25
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:15,187
This lesson is structured into
4 main points.

26
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:16,862
First,

27
00:01:17,062 --> 00:01:19,462
the contextual framework
and the problems of pollution.

28
00:01:20,299 --> 00:01:21,162
Then,

29
00:01:21,362 --> 00:01:23,974
the geographical presentation
of the Ebrié lagoon.

30
00:01:25,037 --> 00:01:27,637
Third, the methodology of
the use of sites

31
00:01:27,812 --> 00:01:29,762
for the mapping of
the pollution indices.

32
00:01:30,137 --> 00:01:32,124
And finally, the results obtained

33
00:01:32,324 --> 00:01:34,662
and the exploitation for
the decision-making.

34
00:01:39,337 --> 00:01:42,674
The contextual framework of
the study is the water pollution.

35
00:01:43,424 --> 00:01:45,799
We will develop successively

36
00:01:45,999 --> 00:01:48,074
the lagoon pollution problems,

37
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:49,387
the causes and the threats

38
00:01:49,587 --> 00:01:51,037
asa well as the interest of GIS

39
00:01:51,237 --> 00:01:52,699
in the study of the pollution.

40
00:01:53,762 --> 00:01:56,099
Pollution expresses a state
of degradation

41
00:01:56,299 --> 00:01:58,499
and deterioration of the aquatic
environment.

42
00:01:58,699 --> 00:02:00,762
This is a topical subject in Abidjan

43
00:02:01,124 --> 00:02:04,574
because the Ebrié lagoon system
undergoes various types of pollution.

44
00:02:05,262 --> 00:02:06,862
Formerly called the pearl of the lagoons,

45
00:02:07,062 --> 00:02:08,412
this vast area of water

46
00:02:08,612 --> 00:02:11,412
which surrounds the city of Abidjan
has suffered for a few decades

47
00:02:11,612 --> 00:02:14,325
of a degradation of the quality and
a silent death.

48
00:02:14,549 --> 00:02:16,249
What are the types of pollution

49
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:17,712
which affect this stretch of water?

50
00:02:17,912 --> 00:02:19,462
They can be classified in 4.

51
00:02:19,662 --> 00:02:20,862
Physical pollution,

52
00:02:21,062 --> 00:02:23,700
when the limpidity and the
temperature are changed.

53
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,875
Chemical pollution,

54
00:02:25,187 --> 00:02:26,825
the nitrates, the heavy metals

55
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,062
and other micro-pollutants
are released into the water.

56
00:02:29,262 --> 00:02:30,387
Organic pollution

57
00:02:30,562 --> 00:02:32,312
when there is an over-consumption
of oxygen.

58
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,012
Microbiological pollution,

59
00:02:34,212 --> 00:02:35,775
the bacteria and parasites.

60
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:38,025
The city of Abidjan continues to expand.

61
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,737
The lagoon pollution problems

62
00:02:39,912 --> 00:02:41,612
are becoming more and more worrying.

63
00:02:41,812 --> 00:02:42,762
The most importante pollution load

64
00:02:42,962 --> 00:02:45,075
is that of the waste water,

65
00:02:45,275 --> 00:02:47,837
domestic waste whose 
theorical throughput

66
00:02:48,037 --> 00:02:50,187
of about 37,000 tonnes per year.

67
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:52,262
Measures have already been taken

68
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:53,562
but the situation requires

69
00:02:53,762 --> 00:02:55,775
a concrete and immediate intervention

70
00:02:55,975 --> 00:02:58,112
if we don't want it
to become irreversible

71
00:02:58,312 --> 00:03:00,012
in order to restore the ecosystems

72
00:03:00,212 --> 00:03:03,637
and be able to call the Ebrié lagoon system
the "pearl of the lagoons" again.

73
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:05,025
On this picture,

74
00:03:05,225 --> 00:03:07,500
a view of the lagoon from
the M'pouto neighborhood

75
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:10,500
shows the waste and the
proliferation of aquatic plants

76
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,412
which give an idea of ​​the pollution.

77
00:03:12,612 --> 00:03:14,662
It is necessary to reverse the trend

78
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:16,400
and to restore this stretch of water

79
00:03:16,575 --> 00:03:18,087
which bathes the Abidjan agglomeration.

80
00:03:18,475 --> 00:03:19,487
We approach

81
00:03:19,687 --> 00:03:22,612
in this study the specific case
of the chemical pollution

82
00:03:22,812 --> 00:03:24,837
of the Ebrié lagoon in Abidjan.

83
00:03:25,037 --> 00:03:27,437
This pollution is due to the release

84
00:03:27,637 --> 00:03:28,937
of industrial waste

85
00:03:29,137 --> 00:03:31,062
that is to say heavy metals
such as cadmium,

86
00:03:31,262 --> 00:03:34,262
lead, mercury, manganese, copper

87
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,587
of hydrocarbon,

88
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:40,425
of untreated waste water
from household waste

89
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,350
and pesticides

90
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,612
of agricultural pollutants

91
00:03:44,812 --> 00:03:46,387
from the mechanical erosion

92
00:03:46,587 --> 00:03:47,975
of cultivated soils.

93
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,862
This pollution threatens the
integrity of the environment,

94
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:55,862
affects the biological diversity,

95
00:03:56,475 --> 00:03:57,400
health,

96
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,425
the food chain,

97
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:00,862
the tourism,

98
00:04:01,687 --> 00:04:03,512
fishing, and so on.

99
00:04:03,712 --> 00:04:06,437
This poses a real integrated
management problem

100
00:04:06,637 --> 00:04:07,537
of water resources

101
00:04:07,737 --> 00:04:10,862
to which the ministry in charge
of water resources

102
00:04:11,062 --> 00:04:12,537
and that of the environment

103
00:04:12,737 --> 00:04:14,662
are trying to find a solution.

104
00:04:15,437 --> 00:04:16,775
The GIS tools

105
00:04:16,975 --> 00:04:19,512
allow to establish a database

106
00:04:19,712 --> 00:04:22,037
of chemical analysis

107
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:24,737
of cartographic or satellite data,

108
00:04:25,762 --> 00:04:26,862
to analyze,

109
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:28,450
combine

110
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,937
data and pictures

111
00:04:30,312 --> 00:04:31,050
in order to

112
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,625
locate the level of pollution and
determine vulnerable

113
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,450
sites,

114
00:04:35,162 --> 00:04:36,750
to raise the awareness of
the decision-makers

115
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,512
and populations to adopt a
citizen behavior

116
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:42,575
to restore the Ebrié lagoon system.

117
00:04:53,725 --> 00:04:54,750
Now,

118
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,687
let's describe

119
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:58,400
the Ebrié lagoon around Abidjan.

120
00:04:59,337 --> 00:05:00,550
The selected study site

121
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:03,387
crosses the Abidjan agglomeration

122
00:05:03,587 --> 00:05:04,712
from West to East.

123
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:08,412
The remarkable economic
development of the Ivory Coast

124
00:05:08,612 --> 00:05:10,475
has been accompanied since the 60s

125
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,200
by a strong urbanization

126
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,100
which has not spared
the economic capital

127
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,375
of Abidjan

128
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:20,212
which is built on the banks of
the Ebrié lagoon.

129
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:22,325
This urbanization,

130
00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:25,300
which led to a high concentration
of population

131
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,787
around the Ebrié lagoon system

132
00:05:27,987 --> 00:05:30,450
led the public authorities to propose

133
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,887
a master plan

134
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:33,925
for the development of
the city of Abidjan

135
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:36,162
which led to the occupation of the land.

136
00:05:36,925 --> 00:05:39,037
Outside of the Banco national park,

137
00:05:39,237 --> 00:05:41,325
all the banks of the Ebrié lagoon
system

138
00:05:41,525 --> 00:05:43,975
are used by humans.

139
00:05:44,175 --> 00:05:46,087
There are agricultural developments,

140
00:05:46,287 --> 00:05:49,112
pastures, lowland crops, cash crops,

141
00:05:49,312 --> 00:05:52,200
urban development, houses,

142
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,637
road networks

143
00:05:53,837 --> 00:05:55,812
and constructions

144
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:56,762
of...

145
00:05:57,262 --> 00:05:59,237
companies and factories.

146
00:06:00,012 --> 00:06:02,875
This study was accentuated on
3 bays

147
00:06:03,075 --> 00:06:04,412
of the Ebrié lagoon.

148
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:07,387
To the West, the Biétry Bay,

149
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:09,700
in the center the Koumassi bay

150
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,837
and to the East, the Abou-Abou bay.

151
00:06:12,037 --> 00:06:13,575
These were chosen

152
00:06:13,775 --> 00:06:16,775
for their sensitivity to the strong
pressure of the population

153
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:19,475
and the various industrial
activities developed

154
00:06:19,675 --> 00:06:21,087
around them.

155
00:06:21,737 --> 00:06:23,587
Near the Biétry bay

156
00:06:23,787 --> 00:06:25,825
there are heavy industries

157
00:06:26,025 --> 00:06:27,325
such as refinery

158
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:28,487
soap factories,

159
00:06:28,687 --> 00:06:30,162
breweries and so on.

160
00:06:30,362 --> 00:06:32,237
In the case of the Koumassi bay,

161
00:06:32,437 --> 00:06:34,237
there are small industries

162
00:06:34,437 --> 00:06:37,350
and companies manufacturing PVC,

163
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,937
processing wood and so on.

164
00:06:40,137 --> 00:06:41,425
The Abou-Abou bay

165
00:06:41,625 --> 00:06:43,312
remains the least industrialized

166
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:44,625
and more inhabited.

167
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:45,825
It is surrounded

168
00:06:46,025 --> 00:06:48,525
by mangrove and coconut plantations.

169
00:06:59,325 --> 00:07:01,650
The methodological approach adopted

170
00:07:01,862 --> 00:07:03,337
consists of three steps.

171
00:07:04,075 --> 00:07:06,725
First, the data acquisition.

172
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:11,312
Second, the development of pollution maps.

173
00:07:12,762 --> 00:07:13,912
Thirdly,

174
00:07:14,187 --> 00:07:15,875
help in decision making.

175
00:07:16,887 --> 00:07:19,175
These different steps will be described

176
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,362
in the following sections.

177
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:22,925
In 2001,

178
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:25,825
sub-surface samples

179
00:07:26,437 --> 00:07:29,787
of 0 to 2 cm were collected around

180
00:07:29,975 --> 00:07:32,525
domestic waste and
industrial activities sites

181
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,725
in the 3 bays, that is to say
the Biétry,

182
00:07:35,925 --> 00:07:38,075
Koumassi and Abou-Abou bays.

183
00:07:38,512 --> 00:07:40,412
The different positions
of the samples

184
00:07:40,612 --> 00:07:43,475
XY are recorded using a GPS.

185
00:07:44,075 --> 00:07:45,925
In the chemical laboratory

186
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:48,900
of the Anti-Pollution Ivorian Center
CIAPOL,

187
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:50,700
samples are processed

188
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:53,812
and the measurement of the
concentration of the different metals

189
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:54,937
is done

190
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:58,050
by ICP emission spectrometry.

191
00:07:59,062 --> 00:08:00,625
The measured parameters are

192
00:08:00,825 --> 00:08:01,600
the zinc,

193
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,375
the iron, the copper,

194
00:08:03,575 --> 00:08:05,550
the cadmium and the manganese.

195
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,187
As for the chemical analysis of
hydrocarbons

196
00:08:08,862 --> 00:08:11,775
it was carried out by
spectrofluorimetry.

197
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:13,837
The use of GIS

198
00:08:14,037 --> 00:08:16,275
for the development of
pollution index maps

199
00:08:16,462 --> 00:08:17,887
includes several steps.

200
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:19,612
First,

201
00:08:19,812 --> 00:08:21,475
we must georeference the map

202
00:08:21,675 --> 00:08:23,787
of the Ebrié lagoon in Abidjan

203
00:08:23,987 --> 00:08:26,125
by the defining the projection system,

204
00:08:26,325 --> 00:08:27,625
WGS 84,

205
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,700
zone 30 North,

206
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,900
and entering the X and Y coordinates

207
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,675
of the points on the map.

208
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:38,512
This phase is essential so that
all the data used

209
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:41,075
project and overlap themselves perfectly.

210
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:42,962
Then,

211
00:08:43,162 --> 00:08:45,950
we digitalize the contours of the
study area,

212
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:48,925
in particular the Ebrié lagoon in Abidjan.

213
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:50,450
This is necessary

214
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,787
for the interpolations not
to be carried out

215
00:08:52,987 --> 00:08:54,775
beyond the study area.

216
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:57,650
Another very important step

217
00:08:57,850 --> 00:08:59,612
is the exploitation of the analysis files.

218
00:08:59,912 --> 00:09:00,587
Thus,

219
00:09:00,787 --> 00:09:03,787
by using the X and Y coordinates
of the various points

220
00:09:03,987 --> 00:09:06,412
and the concentrations of heavy metals

221
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:07,912
associated with them,

222
00:09:08,112 --> 00:09:10,775
it is possible to interpolate the
variables

223
00:09:10,975 --> 00:09:13,062
and develop maps.

224
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,062
Why interpolate

225
00:09:15,287 --> 00:09:17,087
and why reclassify?

226
00:09:17,975 --> 00:09:19,337
The data are interpolated

227
00:09:19,537 --> 00:09:20,462
to illustrate

228
00:09:20,662 --> 00:09:23,662
the geochemical spatial tendency
in the lagoon.

229
00:09:24,925 --> 00:09:25,712
Thus,

230
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,750
given the density distribution
of the collected points sowing

231
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:30,912
in the lagoon,

232
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:32,537
the method reverses the distances

233
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:34,625
and hence I,D and W,

234
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,275
which relies on the 3 closest points

235
00:09:37,562 --> 00:09:39,350
within the study area

236
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:40,887
and that suits best

237
00:09:41,087 --> 00:09:42,312
was used.

238
00:09:43,187 --> 00:09:44,912
Why reclassify?

239
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:46,737
It is question of defining

240
00:09:46,912 --> 00:09:48,000
pollution levels

241
00:09:48,362 --> 00:09:51,175
which are linked
to heavy metal contents

242
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,337
and which are recorded in the water.

243
00:09:53,637 --> 00:09:55,950
4 levels or classes have been defined.

244
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,112
The level 1

245
00:09:58,312 --> 00:10:00,774
expresses very low levels
of heavy metals.

246
00:10:00,987 --> 00:10:04,212
Level 2, 3 and 4 correspond respectively

247
00:10:04,550 --> 00:10:05,399
to low,

248
00:10:05,599 --> 00:10:08,237
high and very high levels of
heavy metals.

249
00:10:08,437 --> 00:10:09,937
These levels correspond

250
00:10:10,137 --> 00:10:11,749
to significant levels

251
00:10:11,949 --> 00:10:13,949
in the natural variation observed

252
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:15,787
within each parameter.

253
00:10:15,987 --> 00:10:17,974
These 4 values ​​thus defined

254
00:10:18,174 --> 00:10:20,337
do not obey an international standard.

255
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:22,862
They have a purely local character

256
00:10:23,062 --> 00:10:25,162
whose interest is to compare the bays

257
00:10:25,362 --> 00:10:26,224
with each other.

258
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:28,287
From QGIS,

259
00:10:28,487 --> 00:10:29,912
we have exported

260
00:10:30,112 --> 00:10:32,199
the attribute tables and you see

261
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,949
the values ​​of cadmium, copper and iron.

262
00:10:35,699 --> 00:10:37,499
And this table will therefore be used

263
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:39,749
to interpolate

264
00:10:40,237 --> 00:10:42,949
from the inverse distance method.

265
00:10:43,149 --> 00:10:44,712
So we choose cadmium

266
00:10:44,912 --> 00:10:46,287
and we add it.

267
00:10:46,487 --> 00:10:48,624
We are dealing with cell size

268
00:10:48,824 --> 00:10:50,137
parameters

269
00:10:50,337 --> 00:10:51,874
and we give a name

270
00:10:52,074 --> 00:10:54,574
to save the map

271
00:10:54,774 --> 00:10:55,999
resulting from the interpolation.

272
00:10:56,199 --> 00:10:58,762
And the interpolation has just been
carried out.

273
00:10:59,012 --> 00:11:01,149
In the tool,

274
00:11:01,349 --> 00:11:03,137
the same tool, we will do

275
00:11:03,337 --> 00:11:04,387
the same exercice

276
00:11:04,587 --> 00:11:07,462
so that you to understand
it well with iron.

277
00:11:07,662 --> 00:11:09,324
Always ensure

278
00:11:09,524 --> 00:11:11,462
that you have chosen sizes

279
00:11:11,662 --> 00:11:14,724
for the sampling which is
set here at 50 m.

280
00:11:15,587 --> 00:11:18,049
And we do the same
interpolation to do it.

281
00:11:19,262 --> 00:11:21,612
So we have maps that have been
established

282
00:11:21,812 --> 00:11:23,799
and we will take the iron map

283
00:11:24,149 --> 00:11:26,999
to display it in different grids levels

284
00:11:27,199 --> 00:11:28,212
or in color.

285
00:11:28,412 --> 00:11:30,649
Here, we display it in color.

286
00:11:30,849 --> 00:11:32,999
We also take the cadmium map

287
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:35,687
which we also display in color.

288
00:11:37,187 --> 00:11:39,387
You will see that we always reverse

289
00:11:39,587 --> 00:11:41,387
so that the high rates

290
00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:42,874
are displayed in red.

291
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:45,462
So here are the interpolation maps

292
00:11:45,662 --> 00:11:47,849
from the attribute table

293
00:11:48,049 --> 00:11:50,599
which we imported

294
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:54,749
from our GIS software.

295
00:11:55,137 --> 00:11:57,012
So we are going

296
00:11:57,212 --> 00:11:58,987
to reclassify.

297
00:11:59,187 --> 00:11:59,874
And for this,

298
00:12:00,074 --> 00:12:01,324
for the reclassification,

299
00:12:01,524 --> 00:12:04,524
we will choose the
reclassification tool

300
00:12:04,724 --> 00:12:06,787
and before that, we must

301
00:12:06,987 --> 00:12:07,649
import

302
00:12:07,849 --> 00:12:10,724
the file to convert it into a GRID file

303
00:12:10,924 --> 00:12:13,037
And so we will take the cadmium

304
00:12:13,624 --> 00:12:16,612
and convert that cadmium. But,

305
00:12:16,812 --> 00:12:17,549
before that

306
00:12:17,749 --> 00:12:18,912
for the reclassification,

307
00:12:19,187 --> 00:12:20,837
we need a file

308
00:12:21,037 --> 00:12:22,624
by giving the output name

309
00:12:22,824 --> 00:12:25,024
and we need a file

310
00:12:25,224 --> 00:12:26,599
which is a text

311
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:27,949
file.

312
00:12:32,374 --> 00:12:33,974
Here we have just

313
00:12:34,849 --> 00:12:36,849
done the conversion

314
00:12:37,862 --> 00:12:39,862
of the cadmium. We will do

315
00:12:40,062 --> 00:12:41,449
the same for the iron

316
00:12:41,924 --> 00:12:43,537
and so we give an output

317
00:12:43,737 --> 00:12:46,624
file name to convert it to a GRID file

318
00:12:46,824 --> 00:12:47,987
that is to say in a matrix

319
00:12:48,749 --> 00:12:49,949
file.

320
00:12:51,224 --> 00:12:52,387
After that,

321
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:57,762
we have the 2 maps obtained

322
00:12:57,949 --> 00:12:59,137
that is to say the iron

323
00:12:59,337 --> 00:13:00,849
and the cadmium.

324
00:13:01,612 --> 00:13:02,749
We are going

325
00:13:03,224 --> 00:13:04,662
to use

326
00:13:05,524 --> 00:13:08,274
this table which is a reclassification
table. You see here

327
00:13:08,474 --> 00:13:09,612
the iron component

328
00:13:09,812 --> 00:13:13,062
and the cadmium composition
as well as the other metals.

329
00:13:13,262 --> 00:13:15,162
And so we have 4 levels,

330
00:13:15,362 --> 00:13:16,987
level 1, 2 and 3,

331
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:19,287
and to do that,

332
00:13:19,487 --> 00:13:20,987
we need

333
00:13:21,537 --> 00:13:22,637
to use,

334
00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:25,374
as I said earlier, a file

335
00:13:25,574 --> 00:13:27,149
with decision rules

336
00:13:27,349 --> 00:13:29,487
so we choose the iron.

337
00:13:31,712 --> 00:13:33,199
For the decision rules,

338
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:35,287
we need a text file

339
00:13:35,487 --> 00:13:36,637
and these text files,

340
00:13:36,837 --> 00:13:38,787
we will create them.

341
00:13:39,674 --> 00:13:41,212
It is a text file

342
00:13:41,412 --> 00:13:42,924
which includes

343
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:44,287
all the values

344
00:13:44,712 --> 00:13:45,974
from the table

345
00:13:46,174 --> 00:13:47,599
I showed you earlier

346
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,049
that is to say for the iron,

347
00:13:49,474 --> 00:13:50,862
from 0 to 1,

348
00:13:51,124 --> 00:13:54,124
it is the level 1 class, from 1 to 2,
it is the level 2 class

349
00:13:54,324 --> 00:13:56,774
and from 2 to 2, it is
the level 3 class

350
00:13:57,312 --> 00:13:59,637
from 3 to 4, it is the level 3 class.

351
00:13:59,799 --> 00:14:01,162
So we have these different levels

352
00:14:01,337 --> 00:14:02,862
that we will use

353
00:14:03,062 --> 00:14:03,824
for

354
00:14:04,712 --> 00:14:07,437
the reclassification of our map.

355
00:14:08,149 --> 00:14:09,649
We will give

356
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:11,037
an output name,

357
00:14:11,237 --> 00:14:12,174
so the iron.

358
00:14:12,762 --> 00:14:15,762
So we have the output file name

359
00:14:17,487 --> 00:14:21,312
where to give the image not yet
reclassified. So we have reclassified 

360
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:22,449
the iron.

361
00:14:23,599 --> 00:14:24,162
And

362
00:14:24,849 --> 00:14:27,112
we will execute the operation

363
00:14:27,312 --> 00:14:30,787
and so we have finished doing the
reclassification

364
00:14:30,987 --> 00:14:33,074
which consisted of

365
00:14:33,274 --> 00:14:35,812
using different...

366
00:14:36,012 --> 00:14:37,949
the different intervals defined

367
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:40,487
to assign a level of pollution

368
00:14:40,824 --> 00:14:43,874
to each class.

369
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:46,124
Level 1 being the very low level.

370
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:48,837
Level 2, 3 and 4

371
00:14:49,037 --> 00:14:50,024
being the

372
00:14:50,224 --> 00:14:50,899
low

373
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,149
high and very high levels.

374
00:14:53,349 --> 00:14:54,937
And here we go back

375
00:14:55,137 --> 00:14:55,874
to

376
00:14:57,974 --> 00:14:59,074
the cadmium.

377
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:01,937
But before that,

378
00:15:02,137 --> 00:15:03,837
we will open

379
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:06,949
the map that we have just reclassified

380
00:15:07,312 --> 00:15:08,637
which is

381
00:15:08,837 --> 00:15:10,762
the reclassified iron.

382
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:12,412
We will display it

383
00:15:13,187 --> 00:15:14,262
in colour

384
00:15:14,462 --> 00:15:17,837
and with the Pseudo table
in a flat strip

385
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:19,662
and we will always reverse

386
00:15:19,862 --> 00:15:20,749
to put

387
00:15:21,637 --> 00:15:24,374
the highest level in red.

388
00:15:24,574 --> 00:15:27,487
We have to make sure that the
mode that is used

389
00:15:27,687 --> 00:15:29,787
to generate the color palette

390
00:15:29,987 --> 00:15:31,149
is the mode

391
00:15:31,349 --> 00:15:33,587
that concerns the equal intervals.

392
00:15:33,787 --> 00:15:35,349
So, we have 4 classes

393
00:15:35,549 --> 00:15:36,762
and we classify

394
00:15:36,962 --> 00:15:39,137
the images to have these
different levels.

395
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:45,549
The map has just been built.

396
00:15:46,549 --> 00:15:48,012
We apply it and that

397
00:15:48,212 --> 00:15:49,337
will allow us to have

398
00:15:49,537 --> 00:15:51,062
the map of reclassified

399
00:15:51,262 --> 00:15:54,762
iron levels with the different
levels that you see

400
00:15:54,949 --> 00:15:57,437
1, 2, 3, and 4.

401
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,374
We take the same exercise,

402
00:16:04,962 --> 00:16:08,537
here we will apply it for the cadmium.

403
00:16:09,124 --> 00:16:11,299
We will choose the cadmium.

404
00:16:16,349 --> 00:16:18,587
We will give the output name

405
00:16:21,387 --> 00:16:22,874
for the reclassification.

406
00:16:23,824 --> 00:16:25,212
For the cadmium,

407
00:16:25,412 --> 00:16:26,862
you have the intervals

408
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:29,249
that are provided here and
that we will introduce.

409
00:16:29,449 --> 00:16:30,924
So we will have

410
00:16:31,124 --> 00:16:33,674
100, from 0 to 100

411
00:16:33,874 --> 00:16:36,487
from 100 to 170,

412
00:16:36,687 --> 00:16:39,249
and so on, so we fill it to have

413
00:16:39,449 --> 00:16:40,387
the values

414
00:16:40,587 --> 00:16:43,674
of the thresholds that
correspond to the levels

415
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:45,712
that we have displayed

416
00:16:45,912 --> 00:16:46,999
which are the level 1,

417
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,774
level 2, level 3, level 4

418
00:16:49,974 --> 00:16:52,362
which correspond to
different thresholds

419
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,137
fixed for

420
00:16:54,337 --> 00:16:56,549
the reclassification of the cadmium.

421
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:58,924
These elements are used

422
00:16:59,124 --> 00:17:00,299
to

423
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:02,774
classify the different

424
00:17:02,974 --> 00:17:04,849
heavy metals that we had

425
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:06,974
to analyze at

426
00:17:07,174 --> 00:17:09,012
the level of...

427
00:17:09,237 --> 00:17:10,074
at the level of

428
00:17:10,699 --> 00:17:12,974
the region of Abidjan.

429
00:17:14,212 --> 00:17:15,687
And so we have

430
00:17:15,962 --> 00:17:17,274
reclassified

431
00:17:19,874 --> 00:17:20,974
the cadmium.

432
00:17:23,737 --> 00:17:25,674
We can also

433
00:17:25,874 --> 00:17:26,887
display it

434
00:17:27,162 --> 00:17:28,437
by grid level

435
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:29,987
as it now appears

436
00:17:30,187 --> 00:17:31,537
but we can display it

437
00:17:31,737 --> 00:17:34,737
using a color table.

438
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:37,424
And it is the pseudo color.

439
00:17:38,449 --> 00:17:41,274
So we will use this table.

440
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:44,537
Equal intervals.

441
00:17:44,712 --> 00:17:46,149
We bring it to 4.

442
00:17:46,337 --> 00:17:48,874
Always remember to reverse the
colors to put

443
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:52,387
the strongest class in red.

444
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,837
We then click on OK.

445
00:17:56,949 --> 00:17:59,362
We have just reclassified

446
00:17:59,562 --> 00:18:00,562
the cadmium.

447
00:18:00,812 --> 00:18:03,637
You see that the interpolation
goes beyond

448
00:18:03,837 --> 00:18:04,562
the area,

449
00:18:04,862 --> 00:18:06,799
that is to say beyond the lagoon

450
00:18:06,999 --> 00:18:09,699
so we have to cut

451
00:18:09,899 --> 00:18:12,924
that is to say we have to circumscribe
the interpolation areas

452
00:18:13,124 --> 00:18:15,049
to the Ebrié lagoon only

453
00:18:15,249 --> 00:18:16,962
and not in the continental domain.

454
00:18:17,162 --> 00:18:18,999
For this reason, we will choose

455
00:18:20,187 --> 00:18:22,074
the reclassified pictures

456
00:18:22,274 --> 00:18:25,137
but these images must be converted

457
00:18:25,824 --> 00:18:26,912
beforehand

458
00:18:27,112 --> 00:18:28,699
into a file...

459
00:18:33,374 --> 00:18:34,874
as an image file

460
00:18:37,837 --> 00:18:40,012
so we will save

461
00:18:40,212 --> 00:18:41,462
these new images,

462
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:44,387
which have been saved into image file,

463
00:18:44,849 --> 00:18:45,999
into GRID files

464
00:18:46,199 --> 00:18:48,337
which will allow us

465
00:18:48,537 --> 00:18:50,162
to cut afterwards.

466
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,599
And here we look for the directory

467
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,249
in which we can save

468
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:56,399
these images

469
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:02,387
and this is the case of the cadmium

470
00:19:02,587 --> 00:19:04,912
in image, in image mode

471
00:19:05,112 --> 00:19:07,987
and so it is in TIFF or GeoTIFF

472
00:19:08,224 --> 00:19:11,012
that we save these information.

473
00:19:16,199 --> 00:19:17,749
After the cadmium,

474
00:19:18,349 --> 00:19:20,599
we do

475
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,499
the same for the iron.

476
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:34,074
We save

477
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,974
the iron

478
00:19:38,662 --> 00:19:39,812
which is converted

479
00:19:40,649 --> 00:19:42,287
into a TIFF format

480
00:19:42,487 --> 00:19:44,837
in the work directory.

481
00:19:54,624 --> 00:19:56,787
We also save

482
00:19:56,987 --> 00:19:58,037
those data

483
00:19:58,237 --> 00:19:59,512
that we just have

484
00:19:59,712 --> 00:20:00,937
and we will add

485
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:03,724
these different maps

486
00:20:03,924 --> 00:20:05,924
that is to say the cadmium
and the iron

487
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:07,962
converted into picture mode

488
00:20:08,162 --> 00:20:10,962
in our display plan.

489
00:20:15,499 --> 00:20:17,137
We can see

490
00:20:17,337 --> 00:20:19,449
how these diffferent

491
00:20:20,112 --> 00:20:21,399
concentrations evolve

492
00:20:21,624 --> 00:20:24,599
applying mainly on the iron
and the cadmium

493
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,937
and we will now cut

494
00:20:27,562 --> 00:20:29,287
for example the iron

495
00:20:29,487 --> 00:20:31,612
or cadmium map, the cadmium.

496
00:20:31,812 --> 00:20:33,237
The output file

497
00:20:34,137 --> 00:20:35,412
is given

498
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:37,374
as an example.

499
00:20:37,574 --> 00:20:40,074
We will name the output file.

500
00:20:56,362 --> 00:20:57,612
We use

501
00:20:58,337 --> 00:20:59,887
a masking layer

502
00:21:00,087 --> 00:21:01,212
which is the study area

503
00:21:01,412 --> 00:21:02,562
which has been digitized

504
00:21:03,212 --> 00:21:05,762
and we apply this study area

505
00:21:05,937 --> 00:21:07,337
which allows to cut

506
00:21:07,787 --> 00:21:09,887
the area and to have

507
00:21:10,374 --> 00:21:12,887
only the lagoon plan

508
00:21:13,087 --> 00:21:15,287
with the pollution rate.

509
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:16,812
We repeat

510
00:21:17,424 --> 00:21:19,937
the same operation

511
00:21:20,399 --> 00:21:22,687
for the second element

512
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:25,587
which is the cadmium.

513
00:21:29,562 --> 00:21:30,712
And that way

514
00:21:30,912 --> 00:21:33,599
we cut out the pictures.

515
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,987
And this treatment must be
carried out

516
00:21:36,187 --> 00:21:38,437
for all

517
00:21:38,637 --> 00:21:39,199
the

518
00:21:40,137 --> 00:21:40,962
metals

519
00:21:41,137 --> 00:21:42,974
that have been analyzed

520
00:21:43,174 --> 00:21:45,649
that is to say, on top of the
cadmium and the iron,

521
00:21:45,849 --> 00:21:47,774
we must also do it

522
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:50,512
for the manganese, the zinc,

523
00:21:50,712 --> 00:21:51,624
the copper

524
00:21:51,824 --> 00:21:52,974
and for

525
00:21:54,699 --> 00:21:56,524
the hydrocarbon content.

526
00:21:56,724 --> 00:21:58,699
So we have cut

527
00:21:58,899 --> 00:21:59,737
our area

528
00:21:59,937 --> 00:22:02,837
and we have different
concentrations that we can see

529
00:22:03,037 --> 00:22:05,099
which vary according to the items.

530
00:22:05,299 --> 00:22:07,812
The two examples taken are the iron
and the cadmium

531
00:22:08,012 --> 00:22:10,774
which have allowed

532
00:22:10,974 --> 00:22:13,112
to have the spatial distribution

533
00:22:13,349 --> 00:22:16,112
of the different maps.

534
00:22:25,337 --> 00:22:27,199
The purpose of a GIS

535
00:22:27,399 --> 00:22:29,399
is to enable to make decisions.

536
00:22:29,599 --> 00:22:30,837
In our case,

537
00:22:30,999 --> 00:22:33,312
it is a question of clearing
areas identified

538
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:35,137
at the level of the lagoon

539
00:22:35,337 --> 00:22:37,162
on the basis of objective criteria

540
00:22:37,337 --> 00:22:38,687
that could be qualified

541
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:40,474
as polluted areas

542
00:22:40,674 --> 00:22:42,162
or really polluted

543
00:22:42,362 --> 00:22:43,849
or little polluted.

544
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:44,937
For that,

545
00:22:45,137 --> 00:22:47,612
we will qualify the polluted areas

546
00:22:48,937 --> 00:22:50,812
as highly polluted areas

547
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:54,312
if they record at the same
time high levels

548
00:22:54,512 --> 00:22:56,362
of analyzed heavy metals

549
00:22:56,562 --> 00:22:58,824
if the areas of occurrence of
heavy metals

550
00:22:59,024 --> 00:22:59,987
are high.

551
00:23:00,324 --> 00:23:02,712
There are some
areas with little pollution

552
00:23:02,912 --> 00:23:04,612
if they record at the same time

553
00:23:04,812 --> 00:23:06,912
the lowest concentration levels

554
00:23:07,112 --> 00:23:08,099
of heavy metals.

555
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:08,999
Thus,

556
00:23:09,199 --> 00:23:11,112
the 4 themes of polluted areas

557
00:23:11,312 --> 00:23:14,124
are deduced by the combinations of
raster data

558
00:23:14,324 --> 00:23:15,362
such as the addition

559
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:16,624
that will be applied

560
00:23:16,824 --> 00:23:18,899
to the 4 different indices of pollution

561
00:23:19,099 --> 00:23:21,137
of metals and hydrocarbons.

562
00:23:21,337 --> 00:23:22,437
This is how we get

563
00:23:22,637 --> 00:23:23,662
the synthesis map

564
00:23:23,862 --> 00:23:26,374
which allows to make decisions.

565
00:23:27,187 --> 00:23:28,762
The spatial distribution

566
00:23:28,962 --> 00:23:31,287
of iron and copper concentration

567
00:23:31,487 --> 00:23:32,749
reveals the following points.

568
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:34,612
In the Biétry bay,

569
00:23:34,812 --> 00:23:36,962
we have a very high iron content,

570
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:39,299
a very high copper content.

571
00:23:39,949 --> 00:23:41,887
In the Koumassi bay,

572
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:44,074
we have a very high iron content

573
00:23:44,274 --> 00:23:46,349
and an average copper content.

574
00:23:46,862 --> 00:23:48,549
In the Abou-Abou bay,

575
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:50,737
very low iron

576
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:52,637
and copper contents.

577
00:23:53,724 --> 00:23:54,812
If we start talking about

578
00:23:55,012 --> 00:23:56,749
the spatial distribution

579
00:23:57,062 --> 00:23:59,312
of the manganese and the cadmium,

580
00:23:59,512 --> 00:24:00,899
what do we see?

581
00:24:01,499 --> 00:24:03,674
There is a high manganese content

582
00:24:04,012 --> 00:24:06,212
and a high cadmium content

583
00:24:06,412 --> 00:24:07,762
in the Biétry Bay.

584
00:24:08,124 --> 00:24:09,849
As for the Koumassi bay,

585
00:24:10,049 --> 00:24:12,212
we have a low manganese content

586
00:24:12,412 --> 00:24:14,399
and a high cadmium content.

587
00:24:14,849 --> 00:24:17,362
It is in the Abou-Abou bay

588
00:24:17,562 --> 00:24:18,699
that we observe

589
00:24:18,899 --> 00:24:20,562
a high manganese content

590
00:24:20,762 --> 00:24:23,687
and a low cadmium content.

591
00:24:24,887 --> 00:24:26,449
In the case of hydrocarbons,

592
00:24:26,624 --> 00:24:28,249
we observe that the sediments

593
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:29,537
of the Biétry Bay,

594
00:24:29,812 --> 00:24:32,412
there are high hydrocarbon content

595
00:24:32,612 --> 00:24:35,374
while in the Koumassi bay and
the Abou-Abou bay,

596
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:37,962
the rates are low to very low.

597
00:24:38,849 --> 00:24:40,137
The synthetic map

598
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:41,924
of the level of pollution

599
00:24:42,124 --> 00:24:45,074
which was obtained by adding
all the maps

600
00:24:45,274 --> 00:24:46,437
of the pollution indices

601
00:24:46,637 --> 00:24:48,949
shows that the Biétry bay

602
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:50,249
and the Koumassi Bay

603
00:24:50,449 --> 00:24:52,149
are of a higher heavy metals

604
00:24:52,349 --> 00:24:53,499
pollution level.

605
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:56,349
The existence of heavy industries

606
00:24:56,574 --> 00:24:58,899
and the high urbanized area rate

607
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,099
in these areas

608
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,324
could explain this level of pollution

609
00:25:02,524 --> 00:25:03,837
in a context marked

610
00:25:04,037 --> 00:25:05,962
by a low level of equipment

611
00:25:06,162 --> 00:25:07,262
of sanitization.

612
00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:09,074
The Abou-Abou bay

613
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:10,199
is the least polluted

614
00:25:10,574 --> 00:25:12,474
because the anthropic activities

615
00:25:12,674 --> 00:25:14,637
are weakly developed.

616
00:25:15,324 --> 00:25:17,049
The different levels of pollution

617
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,199
highlight

618
00:25:18,399 --> 00:25:20,887
the impact of industrial
development activities

619
00:25:21,087 --> 00:25:23,049
on the quality

620
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:24,287
of water resources

621
00:25:24,487 --> 00:25:27,899
at the level of the city of Abidjan.

622
00:25:29,224 --> 00:25:30,612
The GIS tools

623
00:25:30,812 --> 00:25:32,999
allow to highlight

624
00:25:33,162 --> 00:25:36,224
the risks to which the local populations
bordering the bays are exposed

625
00:25:36,749 --> 00:25:37,774
The maps

626
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:39,637
obtained at the end of this study

627
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:41,537
can guide the ivorian authorities

628
00:25:41,737 --> 00:25:43,824
to take protective measures.

629
00:25:44,024 --> 00:25:45,624
Reduce the pollution,

630
00:25:46,112 --> 00:25:49,337
enforce the principle of
"polluter-payer", of the water Code

631
00:25:49,537 --> 00:25:51,212
and the environmental Code.

632
00:25:51,412 --> 00:25:52,787
This action is related

633
00:25:52,987 --> 00:25:54,737
to the legislative

634
00:25:54,937 --> 00:25:55,949
and regulatory framework.

635
00:25:57,274 --> 00:25:58,437
Another measure,

636
00:25:58,637 --> 00:26:00,287
is to restore the ecosystems.

637
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:01,462
It is to develop

638
00:26:01,662 --> 00:26:03,674
and act on the ecosystem.

639
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:06,374
Another measure is to give back

640
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:09,424
the Ebrié lagoon system its name
"pearl of the lagoons."

641
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:11,512
Thus, we must act

642
00:26:11,712 --> 00:26:14,099
and reverse the pollution trend.

643
00:26:15,987 --> 00:26:17,062
Finally,

644
00:26:17,262 --> 00:26:19,137
it is necessary to adopt
a citizen behavior

645
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:21,274
in respect of the environment

646
00:26:21,474 --> 00:26:24,474
in the governmental project of
the Cocody Bay development.

647
00:26:24,837 --> 00:26:25,787
For that,

648
00:26:25,987 --> 00:26:28,237
we will raise the awareness

649
00:26:28,437 --> 00:26:29,462
of all.

650
00:26:37,612 --> 00:26:39,912
What can we learn from this lesson?

651
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:43,112
We have seen

652
00:26:43,824 --> 00:26:46,274
that we can use a GIS

653
00:26:46,474 --> 00:26:47,562
to exploit

654
00:26:47,762 --> 00:26:49,424
the results of chemical analysis

655
00:26:49,624 --> 00:26:51,649
collected on the ground.

656
00:26:52,149 --> 00:26:53,749
Analysis results for

657
00:26:53,949 --> 00:26:55,499
the heavy metal contents,

658
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:58,387
the cadmium, the copper, the iron,
the manganese, the zinc

659
00:26:58,587 --> 00:26:59,537
and the hydrocarbons.

660
00:27:00,324 --> 00:27:01,837
The study also

661
00:27:02,037 --> 00:27:03,687
allows

662
00:27:03,887 --> 00:27:06,887
to relate the levels of heavy metals

663
00:27:07,387 --> 00:27:10,462
and to identify the sectors
vulnerable to pollution.

664
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:12,999
So you see that the Biétry bay

665
00:27:13,199 --> 00:27:14,249
is heavily polluted

666
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:15,912
while the Abou-Abou bay

667
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:17,212
is weakly polluted.

668
00:27:17,424 --> 00:27:20,412
There is a strong spatial correlation

669
00:27:20,612 --> 00:27:21,774
between certain elements

670
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:24,649
such as iron, zinc and copper.

671
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:26,512
This GIS application

672
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:28,487
to the mapping of pollution indices

673
00:27:28,662 --> 00:27:31,187
can be applied to other
continuous variables.

674
00:27:32,887 --> 00:27:34,549
Goodbye

675
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:37,649
and I look forward to seeing you
for another lesson.
