00:00:31,611 --> 00:00:33,249
Hello and welcome to this lesson

2
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:36,612
devoted to the interaction between
georeferenced data layers.

3
00:00:37,194 --> 00:00:38,640
This interaction between layers

4
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:41,089
uses the concept of 

5
00:00:41,618 --> 00:00:43,370
spatial overlay,

6
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,814
to which a set of methods is related

7
00:00:45,976 --> 00:00:47,366
that allow data transfer

8
00:00:47,528 --> 00:00:50,718
between objects of different types
and stored in different layers

9
00:00:51,062 --> 00:00:54,350
this according to their spatial
relations with each other.

10
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:56,758
We will start with the interaction,

11
00:00:56,937 --> 00:01:00,020
between raster data 
and vectorial data.

12
00:01:01,003 --> 00:01:03,606
The goals of this lesson are to introduce
briefly

13
00:01:03,797 --> 00:01:04,890
the notion of interaction

14
00:01:05,134 --> 00:01:07,097
and differentiate the types of
interactions

15
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,532
between a layer which stores
vectorial information

16
00:01:09,725 --> 00:01:12,333
to a layer which stores 
the image information.

17
00:01:13,012 --> 00:01:15,097
After this lesson, you should be able

18
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:18,008
to distinguish the two types of
raster-vector interactions

19
00:01:18,185 --> 00:01:19,406
which we will describe

20
00:01:19,972 --> 00:01:21,924
and to implement them in 
the QGIS software

21
00:01:22,101 --> 00:01:24,169
following the instructions that
will follow.

22
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,438
The spatial overlay is
the emblematic function

23
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:39,383
of geographic information systems.

24
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,949
It alone symbolizes the originality

25
00:01:42,146 --> 00:01:44,746
of these information systems
in relation to others

26
00:01:44,916 --> 00:01:47,304
and above all that gives them
all their power.

27
00:01:47,905 --> 00:01:48,917
Indeed,

28
00:01:49,113 --> 00:01:51,653
the analysis of phenomena distributed
in the geographic space

29
00:01:51,825 --> 00:01:52,751
often requires

30
00:01:53,055 --> 00:01:55,273
that we simultaneously resort 
to information

31
00:01:55,458 --> 00:01:57,071
from distinct layers.

32
00:01:57,921 --> 00:01:59,687
This can be the case, for example,

33
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:03,011
if we want to calculate the sum of the
number of inhabitants per department,

34
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:05,060
the latter being polygons,

35
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:08,771
whereas the population data is
stored in a distinct layer

36
00:02:08,952 --> 00:02:12,027
containing their capital, so a
series of centroids.

37
00:02:13,182 --> 00:02:16,434
The interaction made possible
by the spatial overlay

38
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,791
can allow the transfer of data

39
00:02:19,001 --> 00:02:21,460
from a source layer to a target layer

40
00:02:21,771 --> 00:02:23,899
by implementing a specific method

41
00:02:24,103 --> 00:02:26,602
partially induced by the types of
layers considered,

42
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:28,516
as we will see a little later.

43
00:02:28,998 --> 00:02:31,067
The spatial interaction can take place,

44
00:02:31,254 --> 00:02:33,295
between several vector layers,

45
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:36,261
between raster layers and 
vectorial layers

46
00:02:36,613 --> 00:02:39,554
or between several raster layers.

47
00:02:40,514 --> 00:02:43,220
The constraints to the implementation
of spatial interaction

48
00:02:43,584 --> 00:02:47,291
are the use of an identical
coordinate projection system

49
00:02:48,097 --> 00:02:50,560
and a common spatial coverage.

50
00:02:59,086 --> 00:03:02,163
In the case of the 
vector-raster interaction

51
00:03:02,363 --> 00:03:03,915
which we are looking at in this lesson,

52
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:06,086
the first type of information transfer

53
00:03:06,266 --> 00:03:09,156
that we distinguish is that of
the extraction a variable z

54
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:11,166
stored in the pixels of a raster

55
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:14,588
and its copy in a series of
punctual vectorial objects

56
00:03:14,825 --> 00:03:16,223
spatially distributed

57
00:03:16,417 --> 00:03:19,328
and stored in a superimposed 
vectorial layer.

58
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:23,721
This typical implementation of
the concept of spatial coincidence

59
00:03:24,146 --> 00:03:26,132
allows for example to know the altitude

60
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,554
of a series of measurement points

61
00:03:27,726 --> 00:03:29,566
which are distributed 
in a mountain massif,

62
00:03:29,737 --> 00:03:32,066
as shown here on the screen.

63
00:03:32,982 --> 00:03:36,018
In QGIS, it is the extension
"point sampling tool"

64
00:03:36,506 --> 00:03:38,530
which allows to carry out 
this type of operation.

65
00:03:38,996 --> 00:03:41,169
Let's see how it works.

66
00:03:42,437 --> 00:03:43,761
In the QGIS project

67
00:03:43,961 --> 00:03:47,080
we have a raster file of
the digital ground model

68
00:03:47,592 --> 00:03:48,663
and a vectorial file

69
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,679
containing the points for which we
want to extract the altitude.

70
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:54,659
In order to combine the two layers,

71
00:03:54,929 --> 00:03:56,472
we must first ensure

72
00:03:56,647 --> 00:03:58,933
that they are in the same 
projection system.

73
00:03:59,821 --> 00:04:02,605
To do this, we can right click 
on the raster layer,

74
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,732
then define the SRC of a layer,

75
00:04:06,273 --> 00:04:10,771
we choose the swiss projection 
system CH1903/LV03

76
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:14,716
and we do the same for 
the vectorial file.

77
00:04:16,613 --> 00:04:19,800
Now that the two layers are
in the same projection system

78
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:23,278
we will be able to extract the altitude 
for the points that interest us.

79
00:04:24,082 --> 00:04:28,156
For now, the "points" layer contains
only one attribute:

80
00:04:28,582 --> 00:04:30,004
that is its identifier.

81
00:04:30,422 --> 00:04:32,899
We will add an altitude column

82
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:35,484
using the "point sampling tool".

83
00:04:36,072 --> 00:04:37,980
This tool is an extension of QGIS

84
00:04:38,175 --> 00:04:39,929
and so we have to install it first.

85
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:42,910
By going to the "extensions" menu

86
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:45,426
"install", "manage extensions"

87
00:04:46,027 --> 00:04:48,664
we can search the "point sampling tool"

88
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:51,125
in the search bar and click on the tool

89
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:52,849
when it appears in the list,

90
00:04:53,182 --> 00:04:55,896
then ask to "install the extension".

91
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:58,720
The extension is thus automatically
installed

92
00:04:58,908 --> 00:05:00,945
and we can click on "close".

93
00:05:02,375 --> 00:05:04,148
The tool has been installed

94
00:05:04,335 --> 00:05:09,097
under the "extensions" menu, 
"analysis", "point sampling tool".

95
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:11,550
under the "general" tab,

96
00:05:11,734 --> 00:05:14,760
we must first define the layer
containing the points.

97
00:05:15,401 --> 00:05:17,683
In our case, it is the 
layer named "points".

98
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:22,196
We must then choose the layers 
which values we want to retrieve.

99
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:25,061
In our case, we select the raster file

100
00:05:25,263 --> 00:05:26,724
of the digital ground model.

101
00:05:27,394 --> 00:05:30,357
At this point, we also tick
the "points" vectorial file

102
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:33,418
in order to retrieve 
attributes of this file,

103
00:05:33,605 --> 00:05:35,804
in our case the identifier of the point.

104
00:05:36,283 --> 00:05:37,677
On the "field" tab,

105
00:05:37,877 --> 00:05:39,160
we have a preview of the columns

106
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:41,379
that will be present in the result file.

107
00:05:41,790 --> 00:05:43,790
So we will see the identifier
of the points

108
00:05:43,965 --> 00:05:46,217
and the value extracted from 
the digital altitude model.

109
00:05:47,093 --> 00:05:50,431
We will rename this last column
"altitude".

110
00:05:51,568 --> 00:05:53,593
We then return in the "general" tab

111
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,980
to define the name of the result file

112
00:05:56,182 --> 00:05:58,337
and where we want to save it,

113
00:05:58,537 --> 00:06:00,995
we can then click on OK.

114
00:06:03,307 --> 00:06:05,785
The result layer was loaded
into the project.

115
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:07,271
We find

116
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:09,907
all the points for which we
wanted to extract the altitude

117
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:11,894
and if we open the attribute table,

118
00:06:12,104 --> 00:06:14,687
we now see the presence 
of an "altitude" column

119
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,278
which gives us the required information.

120
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:32,403
The second type of information transfer

121
00:06:32,582 --> 00:06:35,035
between a raster and vectorial layer

122
00:06:35,222 --> 00:06:37,426
is that of the extraction 
of a statistic

123
00:06:37,752 --> 00:06:40,194
of the values ​​stored in the pixels
of a raster layer

124
00:06:40,383 --> 00:06:41,941
and which must be brought back

125
00:06:42,141 --> 00:06:44,892
to the superimposed polygons
to characterize them.

126
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:49,072
These statistics can be the sum
of the variable of interest,

127
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:53,016
its maximum, its minimum, its
standard deviation, its median, etc.

128
00:06:54,489 --> 00:06:55,534
Here for example,

129
00:06:55,721 --> 00:06:58,424
we want to calculate the average rainfall

130
00:06:58,595 --> 00:07:00,985
by administrative regions in Kenya.

131
00:07:01,684 --> 00:07:03,348
To perform this type of operation,

132
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,914
QGIS has a tool called
"area statistics".

133
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,969
In the QGIS project

134
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,765
we have a raster file with the rainfall

135
00:07:11,961 --> 00:07:15,899
and a vectorial file of polygons
with the delimitation of African countries.

136
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:17,799
We will also display

137
00:07:17,976 --> 00:07:21,026
the polygons of the contours of
administrative regions of Kenya

138
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:24,184
for which we would like
to know the average rainfall.

139
00:07:24,843 --> 00:07:27,648
This file contains currently
only two attributes:

140
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:30,215
the identifier and the name of
each region.

141
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:34,293
To calculate the average rainfall,

142
00:07:34,508 --> 00:07:37,020
we are going to use the 
"area statistics" tool.

143
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:39,922
This tool is an extension

144
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:42,046
so we have to install it first.

145
00:07:42,233 --> 00:07:45,977
In the "extensions" menu, "install",
"manage extensions"

146
00:07:46,984 --> 00:07:50,729
we can search "area statistics"
and tick the small box.

147
00:07:51,912 --> 00:07:53,896
The extension is installed

148
00:07:54,096 --> 00:07:55,901
and we can click on "close".

149
00:07:57,106 --> 00:07:59,292
This extension has been installed
in the "area statistics" 

150
00:07:59,485 --> 00:08:01,491
raster menu.

151
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:05,122
It will allow to calculate the average
and the sum of precipitations

152
00:08:05,313 --> 00:08:08,190
for each polygon of the 
administrative regions of Kenya.

153
00:08:08,992 --> 00:08:10,316
Under "raster layer",

154
00:08:10,495 --> 00:08:13,494
we define the raster layer
containing the values ​​on which

155
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:15,587
we want to calculate the statistics.

156
00:08:16,001 --> 00:08:18,649
In our case, this is the rainfall file.

157
00:08:19,872 --> 00:08:22,737
Under "polygon layer" 
containing the areas,

158
00:08:23,052 --> 00:08:26,147
we choose the administrative
regions of Kenya.

159
00:08:26,997 --> 00:08:29,403
The results will be added directly

160
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:32,170
as a new attribute of the layer
containing polygons.

161
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:35,343
We can, if we wish, define
a possible prefix

162
00:08:35,518 --> 00:08:37,827
which will be placed before
the name of each column.

163
00:08:38,576 --> 00:08:42,584
Here we will put the prefix "prec"
for precipitations.

164
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:44,984
You can then click on OK.

165
00:08:47,227 --> 00:08:48,779
Once the calculation is complete,

166
00:08:48,973 --> 00:08:52,170
we can return to our vectorial
file of the administrative divisions

167
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:53,908
and open the attribute table.

168
00:08:54,542 --> 00:08:57,206
We see that three new columns
have been added,

169
00:08:57,881 --> 00:09:00,109
all beginning with the prefix "prec".

170
00:09:00,994 --> 00:09:03,247
The first contains the number of values

171
00:09:03,427 --> 00:09:05,078
that were present in each polygon

172
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,756
so the number of pixels.

173
00:09:07,454 --> 00:09:10,379
The second column shows
the sum of precipitations

174
00:09:11,002 --> 00:09:14,429
and the last column contains
the average that we wanted to know.

175
00:09:16,986 --> 00:09:19,752
Now we can represent 
each region of Kenya

176
00:09:19,936 --> 00:09:22,478
with a color depending 
on the average rainfall.

177
00:09:23,006 --> 00:09:24,058
To do this,

178
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:26,764
it necessary go to the properties
of the vectorial layer,

179
00:09:26,931 --> 00:09:28,272
in the "style" tab.

180
00:09:28,477 --> 00:09:30,314
We choose a graduated style

181
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,374
on the "precmean" column.

182
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:37,007
We can choose a suitable color palette

183
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:39,986
and a class or discretization

184
00:09:40,211 --> 00:09:41,776
based on natural soils.

185
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:45,629
We click on OK and we obtain
the desired map.

186
00:09:56,072 --> 00:09:57,847
We have seen in this lesson

187
00:09:58,022 --> 00:10:00,780
that the analysis of georeferenced
phenomena often requires

188
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,805
that we combine informations
from distinct layers.

189
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:06,390
Among the types of possible
spatial interactions

190
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:08,363
in this first module on the interaction

191
00:10:08,694 --> 00:10:10,448
we focused on the interaction

192
00:10:10,631 --> 00:10:11,995
between a raster layer

193
00:10:12,176 --> 00:10:14,711
and a layer storing 
vectorial information.

194
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:18,891
We have seen that QGIS allows 
to perform this type of operation

195
00:10:19,108 --> 00:10:21,275
with the "point sampling tool" extension

196
00:10:21,451 --> 00:10:24,358
for the data transfer between a layer
in image mode

197
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:27,017
and a distribution of 
superimposed centroids.

198
00:10:28,012 --> 00:10:30,787
And this is the "area statistics" 
extension of QGIS

199
00:10:30,981 --> 00:10:34,725
which allows to calculate statistics
on the values ​​of a raster layer

200
00:10:35,107 --> 00:10:38,994
brought back in areas defined by
a file of superimposed polygons.
