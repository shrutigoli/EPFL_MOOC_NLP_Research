00:00:30,274 --> 00:00:33,624
Welcome to this basic
lesson on digital altitude models

2
00:00:33,937 --> 00:00:36,874
which allow us to
model the topography.

3
00:00:37,237 --> 00:00:39,512
The relief represents by definition

4
00:00:39,712 --> 00:00:42,624
the shape and the inequalities
of the earth's surface.

5
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:44,762
It stems from geological

6
00:00:44,962 --> 00:00:47,587
and climatological movements that occurred
over the course of thousands of years.

7
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:49,537
According to these properties,

8
00:00:49,737 --> 00:00:51,899
the animal and vegetable kingdoms

9
00:00:52,099 --> 00:00:54,512
find favorable conditions
to their evolution.

10
00:00:55,112 --> 00:00:56,512
They also condition

11
00:00:56,712 --> 00:00:58,737
the appropriation
of the geographical space

12
00:00:58,924 --> 00:00:59,937
by human beings.

13
00:01:01,424 --> 00:01:04,437
The primary measure of the relief
is the altitude on sea.

14
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:05,837
And a digital file

15
00:01:06,037 --> 00:01:07,987
which contains the altitude measurements

16
00:01:08,187 --> 00:01:09,862
at the node of a regular grid

17
00:01:10,062 --> 00:01:13,162
constitutes what is called
a numerical model of altitude.

18
00:01:14,187 --> 00:01:15,324
In this lesson,

19
00:01:15,524 --> 00:01:19,112
we will study some modes
of altitude acquisition

20
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:21,762
as well as the different
representation techniques

21
00:01:21,962 --> 00:01:24,612
of the digital altitude models.

22
00:01:25,599 --> 00:01:27,749
The goals of this
lesson are to explain

23
00:01:27,949 --> 00:01:31,124
the functioning of the various
altitude acquisition techniques

24
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:32,974
of representation of the relief.

25
00:01:33,499 --> 00:01:34,924
At the end of this lesson,

26
00:01:35,124 --> 00:01:38,012
you should be able
to explain the functioning
27
00:01:38,212 --> 00:01:40,624
of the various altitude
acquisition techniques

27
00:01:41,174 --> 00:01:43,637
in order to assess their accuracy

28
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:44,887
and reliability

29
00:01:45,324 --> 00:01:46,699
but also to master

30
00:01:46,899 --> 00:01:49,649
the various topography
representation techniques.

31
00:02:03,874 --> 00:02:05,774
The relief shapes the landscape

32
00:02:05,974 --> 00:02:07,999
and creates more
or less favorable conditions

33
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,374
for human activities,

34
00:02:09,574 --> 00:02:12,049
for the exploitation of the resources
contained in the soil

35
00:02:12,249 --> 00:02:13,962
and also to determine

36
00:02:14,137 --> 00:02:16,400
the habitat of plant
or animal species.

37
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:19,275
The knowledge of these properties

38
00:02:19,462 --> 00:02:20,800
is therefore essential

39
00:02:21,012 --> 00:02:22,587
for many disciplines

40
00:02:22,775 --> 00:02:24,475
and is an important element

41
00:02:24,675 --> 00:02:26,125
in spatial analysis.

42
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,150
The primary relief measure

43
00:02:29,325 --> 00:02:30,437
is the altitude.

44
00:02:30,637 --> 00:02:32,162
The definition of altitude

45
00:02:32,362 --> 00:02:33,837
is the vertical distance

46
00:02:34,037 --> 00:02:35,625
which separates a point from the relief

47
00:02:35,825 --> 00:02:37,850
of the surface of the terrestrial geoid.

48
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:39,587
The geoid is

49
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:42,525
defined as the equipotential
surface in gravity

50
00:02:42,725 --> 00:02:43,462
adjusted

51
00:02:43,662 --> 00:02:45,787
on an average level
of the surface of the sea.

52
00:02:45,987 --> 00:02:48,087
The altitude is a continuous variable

53
00:02:48,287 --> 00:02:50,500
since it is possible
to determine its value

54
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,462
in any point in
the geographical space

55
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:53,975
However,

56
00:02:54,175 --> 00:02:55,862
as the exhaustive consideration

57
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,900
of this information
is not feasible,

58
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,475
we create a model

59
00:02:59,675 --> 00:03:00,750
in which

60
00:03:00,937 --> 00:03:03,387
the altitudes are acquired in a
discontinuous way

61
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:05,612
according to a regular or irregular

62
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,937
sampling mode.

63
00:03:07,137 --> 00:03:09,787
This is called a digital
altitude model or

64
00:03:09,987 --> 00:03:11,587
digital ground model.

65
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:14,125
The properties of
a digital altitude model

66
00:03:14,325 --> 00:03:16,712
are determined by
its acquisition mode

67
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:18,112
and by its accuracy

68
00:03:18,312 --> 00:03:20,637
as we will see in the next section.

69
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:33,625
There are different altitude
acquisition modes

70
00:03:33,825 --> 00:03:36,462
and we have chosen to present
here the most common,

71
00:03:36,912 --> 00:03:38,712
that is the leveling,

72
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:40,650
the photogrammetry

73
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:43,112
and the scanning laser altimetry.

74
00:03:43,725 --> 00:03:45,550
Further information
about them

75
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,287
can be found in the

76
00:03:47,487 --> 00:03:48,575
"element of geomatics" MOOC

77
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:49,637
whose internet address

78
00:03:49,837 --> 00:03:51,725
is displayed here.

79
00:03:52,287 --> 00:03:54,350
The geometric leveling
consists in measuring

80
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,750
an altitude difference

81
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,800
in relation to
a known altitude point

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,150
which is called a leveling landmark.

83
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:02,537
This type of leveling is also called

84
00:04:02,737 --> 00:04:05,612
leveling by horizontal
sight or direct leveling.

85
00:04:05,962 --> 00:04:08,775
The operation consists in measuring
the difference of height

86
00:04:08,937 --> 00:04:09,750
or difference in level

87
00:04:09,950 --> 00:04:11,812
between the point
whose altitude is known

88
00:04:12,012 --> 00:04:13,962
and the point whose
altitude is not known.

89
00:04:14,162 --> 00:04:15,925
This allows by simple subtraction

90
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,925
to determine the altitude
of the points.

91
00:04:18,937 --> 00:04:19,837
To do so,

92
00:04:20,037 --> 00:04:21,037
we use a level

93
00:04:21,237 --> 00:04:23,187
which is a device allowing to
materialize

94
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:25,062
a horizontal line of sight.

95
00:04:26,175 --> 00:04:29,512
This level is placed on a tripod
halfway of 2 sights

96
00:04:29,712 --> 00:04:31,750
which are held
vertically at the 2 points.

97
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,425
We will then be able to successively read
in the bezel of the level

98
00:04:35,625 --> 00:04:37,337
a value for each of the points.

99
00:04:37,737 --> 00:04:40,725
The steepness which is the difference
between the 2 values ​​read

100
00:04:40,925 --> 00:04:42,950
added to the altitude of the known point

101
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,000
gives the altitude of the second point.

102
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:47,187
To minimize the errors,

103
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:48,712
the length of a grade

104
00:04:48,912 --> 00:04:50,425
does not exceed 80 m.

105
00:04:52,412 --> 00:04:54,825
As soon as aerial images
were available

106
00:04:55,012 --> 00:04:56,875
from the end of the 19th century,

107
00:04:57,075 --> 00:05:00,125
photogrammetric techniques
have been implemented

108
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:02,050
to make topographical maps

109
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,562
and perform altimetry measurements.

110
00:05:05,987 --> 00:05:07,625
From a geometric point of view,

111
00:05:07,825 --> 00:05:11,625
the photogrammetry proceeds in a
similar way as the human visual system

112
00:05:11,825 --> 00:05:15,087
which is able to perceive
objects from 2 different angles.

113
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,462
As a single image is formed in our brain,

114
00:05:18,662 --> 00:05:20,075
the relation differences

115
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:23,687
between objects translate into
the perception of depth.

116
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,562
Instead of our 2 retinas,

117
00:05:26,762 --> 00:05:30,037
the photogrammetry uses
2 flat images of the same place

118
00:05:30,237 --> 00:05:32,150
and taken at 2 different angles.

119
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:35,525
The 2 images form
a stereoscopic pair

120
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:36,762
from which,

121
00:05:36,962 --> 00:05:39,475
thanks to markers
identifiable on the ground,

122
00:05:39,675 --> 00:05:42,412
we calculate the position of
any object on the ground

123
00:05:42,612 --> 00:05:45,362
in the three dimensions X, Y and Z.

124
00:05:46,487 --> 00:05:48,662
The principle is
to exploit the paralax,

125
00:05:48,862 --> 00:05:51,825
so the apparent shift
on the images of an object

126
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,525
which is seen from 2 different angles.

127
00:05:54,262 --> 00:05:55,475
O1 and O2,

128
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:57,500
are 2 objects in real space.

129
00:05:57,700 --> 00:06:00,350
These two objects are perceived
on the same line of sight.

130
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:04,100
As the position of the images
1 and 2 is known,

131
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:06,912
we can deduce angular relations.

132
00:06:07,587 --> 00:06:09,612
Here, f1 and f2

133
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:12,525
are the photographic focus
of image 1 and 2.

134
00:06:12,825 --> 00:06:15,250
The points O1' O2'

135
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:17,825
and O1" O2"

136
00:06:18,025 --> 00:06:19,637
in the image space

137
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:22,600
are said to be homologues
of the objects O1 and O2.

138
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:26,537
This identification of a pair
of homologous points is called

139
00:06:26,737 --> 00:06:28,887
a stereoscopic pairing.

140
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:33,312
Now, knowing the angular relations
of the triangles

141
00:06:33,512 --> 00:06:34,762
whose vertices is f2

142
00:06:35,025 --> 00:06:37,662
and the distance D' on the image 2,

143
00:06:37,862 --> 00:06:39,650
we can deduce the distance D.

144
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:43,425
To ensure the photogrammetric restitution

145
00:06:43,625 --> 00:06:45,912
we have to have ground landmarks

146
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:48,637
which are easily
identifiable on the images.

147
00:06:49,387 --> 00:06:51,250
This is necessary

148
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:54,500
because the geometry
of the restitution of the 3 dimensions

149
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,600
requires to know perfectly

150
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:59,600
the relative position
of the images when shooting.

151
00:07:00,912 --> 00:07:03,800
The third altitude acquisition
mode presented here

152
00:07:03,975 --> 00:07:06,275
is the scanning laser altimetry.

153
00:07:06,887 --> 00:07:08,925
It is an electronic system

154
00:07:09,125 --> 00:07:10,075
called LIDAR

155
00:07:10,275 --> 00:07:11,912
which measures the return time

156
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:14,125
and the intensity of a laser beam

157
00:07:14,325 --> 00:07:16,837
which is transmitted
from an airborne platform.

158
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:20,037
The ground altitude of the aircraft

159
00:07:20,237 --> 00:07:21,462
or the helicopter

160
00:07:21,662 --> 00:07:24,875
and its position are measured
with very high accuracy

161
00:07:25,075 --> 00:07:27,387
by a differential GPS system.

162
00:07:29,037 --> 00:07:32,137
The knowledge of the precise
position of the platform

163
00:07:32,337 --> 00:07:35,337
and the measure of the roundtrip
times of the laser pulses

164
00:07:35,537 --> 00:07:38,637
allow to calculate the position
of the surface elements

165
00:07:38,912 --> 00:07:40,662
who reflected the signal.

166
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:44,550
Several echoes of the transmitted
signal can be measured

167
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,175
depending on the nature of the soil cover.

168
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:49,337
Indeed,

169
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:52,537
if a first reflection is produced
by the upper parts of a tree,

170
00:07:52,962 --> 00:07:55,825
a part of the signal will be
able to reach lower layers

171
00:07:56,037 --> 00:07:58,837
or even the ground before
being reflected in turn.

172
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,825
The laser of a rangefinder

173
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:03,250
emits from about ten

174
00:08:03,425 --> 00:08:06,262
to several hundreds of thousands
of pulses every second.

175
00:08:06,462 --> 00:08:08,200
It is thus possible to record

176
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,887
several echoes per radius.

177
00:08:11,687 --> 00:08:13,337
The wavelength of the beam

178
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,200
is generally between 08
and 1 micrometer

179
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,225
that is to say in the near infrared.

180
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,787
The intensity of the return signal

181
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:23,987
is a carrier of information
on the properties of the surfaces,

182
00:08:24,187 --> 00:08:26,687
mainly the vegetation cover

183
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:29,125
because it reflects
well its wavelengths.

184
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,487
The upper envelope of the reflections

185
00:08:32,687 --> 00:08:34,112
here represented in green

186
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:36,725
takes the name of digital
surface model.

187
00:08:36,925 --> 00:08:37,962
or MNS

188
00:08:38,162 --> 00:08:39,700
whereas the lower envelope

189
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,000
represented in yellow

190
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,212
corresponds in the vast majority

191
00:08:43,412 --> 00:08:44,900
to the echoes from the ground

192
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,787
and retains the digital terrain
model name.

193
00:08:57,475 --> 00:08:58,875
a surveying of altitude by

194
00:08:59,075 --> 00:09:01,100
sowing of regular
or irregular points,

195
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,912
and acquired by one of the methods
which we have just presented

196
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,162
allows to create
a numerical model of altitude.

197
00:09:07,062 --> 00:09:09,912
We will now present
different types of models

198
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:12,824
beginning with a technique
of representation of the relief

199
00:09:13,024 --> 00:09:14,862
used in the first maps.

200
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:18,187
We will then see the shadow technique

201
00:09:18,612 --> 00:09:20,537
and the contour line model

202
00:09:20,862 --> 00:09:23,399
then the irregular sowing of points

203
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:24,899
before concluding

204
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:26,737
with the model in regular grids.

205
00:09:28,324 --> 00:09:30,774
The cartography has from the beginning

206
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:33,574
granted some importance to
the representation of the relief.

207
00:09:34,137 --> 00:09:36,999
This is in fact an
essential information

208
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:38,424
to locate the objects

209
00:09:38,624 --> 00:09:40,112
in their geographical context.

210
00:09:40,462 --> 00:09:43,212
We were simply representing
the reliefs

211
00:09:43,386 --> 00:09:45,736
with hatchings on old maps

212
00:09:45,936 --> 00:09:47,874
like here on the Dufour map

213
00:09:48,074 --> 00:09:50,674
which represents an area
of ​​the central Valais in Switzerland

214
00:09:50,874 --> 00:09:52,461
in 1885.

215
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,386
We now use shadows

216
00:09:55,586 --> 00:09:57,736
and contour lines
to suggest the relief.

217
00:09:58,224 --> 00:10:00,036
On topographic maps,

218
00:10:00,236 --> 00:10:02,899
shadowing is a qualitative representation

219
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:04,874
which suggests a relief illumination

220
00:10:05,061 --> 00:10:07,024
and a shadow
projected towards the South-East.

221
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:09,436
The contour lines

222
00:10:09,636 --> 00:10:10,911
are linear objects

223
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:13,236
whose quantitative
attribute is the altitude.

224
00:10:13,824 --> 00:10:16,236
This type of model is unsatisfactory

225
00:10:16,436 --> 00:10:17,474
because on its basis,

226
00:10:17,674 --> 00:10:21,161
any derived variable calculation
such as the slope or the orientation

227
00:10:21,361 --> 00:10:22,461
is tedious.

228
00:10:24,299 --> 00:10:26,286
A sowing of irregular points

229
00:10:26,486 --> 00:10:28,086
appears when the altitude

230
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:30,861
is measured punctually
in a random way

231
00:10:31,061 --> 00:10:33,386
or by following relief structure lines.

232
00:10:34,386 --> 00:10:36,111
The altitude in each point

233
00:10:36,274 --> 00:10:37,474
is a measured value

234
00:10:37,674 --> 00:10:39,886
and its precision
depends on the procedure

235
00:10:40,086 --> 00:10:41,586
and the equipments used.

236
00:10:41,936 --> 00:10:44,061
This altitude description model

237
00:10:44,261 --> 00:10:47,661
is similar to that of the triangulated

238
00:10:47,861 --> 00:10:50,524
irregular network

239
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:51,924
frequently used

240
00:10:52,124 --> 00:10:54,836
in engineering to represent
objects in their volume.

241
00:10:56,324 --> 00:10:57,686
Its main advantage

242
00:10:57,886 --> 00:10:59,686
is that it allows
to represent precisely

243
00:10:59,886 --> 00:11:01,524
particular points of the relief.

244
00:11:01,724 --> 00:11:04,724
Its precision depends on
the density of the measured points.

245
00:11:05,286 --> 00:11:06,586
In the grid model,

246
00:11:06,786 --> 00:11:10,086
the altitude points are arranged
according to a regular structure.

247
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:13,236
The resolution or precision of the model

248
00:11:13,436 --> 00:11:15,074
is then the side of the mesh.

249
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:18,849
The coordinates of each point
locate either the nodes of the grid

250
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:21,524
or most frequently
the center of the mesh.

251
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:24,724
It is rare that such a model
consists of measured points

252
00:11:25,336 --> 00:11:26,436
Usually,

253
00:11:26,636 --> 00:11:29,936
it is produced by interpolation
of a sowing of irregular points

254
00:11:30,136 --> 00:11:32,999
so that the accuracy depends on
the acquisition mode

255
00:11:33,199 --> 00:11:35,499
and the interpolation procedure.

256
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:38,286
But the precision
of this type of model

257
00:11:38,461 --> 00:11:41,636
will also depend on the density
of points measured per cell.

258
00:11:41,986 --> 00:11:43,061
Typically,

259
00:11:43,261 --> 00:11:45,061
in the case of altitude
data acquired

260
00:11:45,261 --> 00:11:47,199
by laser scanning altimetry,

261
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,299
the number of points per cell

262
00:11:49,499 --> 00:11:50,986
can vary considerably

263
00:11:51,186 --> 00:11:53,286
depending on the spatial resolution
of the cells

264
00:11:53,486 --> 00:11:54,961
which form the regular grid.

265
00:11:55,586 --> 00:11:57,799
In a relatively standard way
nowadays

266
00:11:57,999 --> 00:11:59,761
we generate digital
altitude models

267
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:01,961
with a spatial resolution of 1 m

268
00:12:02,161 --> 00:12:02,849
or even less

269
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:05,986
and this on the basis
of a ground point density

270
00:12:06,186 --> 00:12:08,849
which varies between 5 and 30 m per m²

271
00:12:09,174 --> 00:12:11,411
according to the laser
rangefinder models.

272
00:12:11,849 --> 00:12:13,099
This has the effect

273
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,361
to open many perspectives
in the study of micro-relief.

274
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:19,524
We have seen that the LIDAR
technology

275
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:22,436
allowed to generate
two distinct types of models

276
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:24,174
either the digital terrain model

277
00:12:24,374 --> 00:12:25,936
which gives the altitude of
he bare ground

278
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,949
and the digital surface model

279
00:12:28,149 --> 00:12:30,199
which indicates the altitude
of the first surface

280
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,124
capable of reflecting the laser beam

281
00:12:32,324 --> 00:12:34,711
like the vegetation cover
for example.

282
00:12:35,574 --> 00:12:37,911
These two models
are part of the category

283
00:12:38,111 --> 00:12:39,924
of digital altitude models.

284
00:12:40,124 --> 00:12:41,886
But their respective quality

285
00:12:42,086 --> 00:12:44,724
enable to generate
a third type of model

286
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:46,761
which is the digital
height model

287
00:12:46,961 --> 00:12:47,874
and which is obtained

288
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:50,749
by subtracting the height
of the surface model

289
00:12:50,949 --> 00:12:52,936
to the altitude of the terrain model.

290
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,211
There.

291
00:13:05,411 --> 00:13:07,599
We have reached the end of this first lesson

292
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,561
dedicated to the digital elevation model.

293
00:13:09,886 --> 00:13:11,086
A fundamental point

294
00:13:11,286 --> 00:13:13,099
is the very important role of the relief

295
00:13:13,299 --> 00:13:14,799
as a determinant factor

296
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:17,336
of the phenomena that occur
on the surface of the Earth.

297
00:13:17,986 --> 00:13:19,186
Therefore,

298
00:13:19,386 --> 00:13:22,286
all the variables that allow
to modelize the topography

299
00:13:22,486 --> 00:13:23,986
play a very important role

300
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:25,449
in spatial analysis.

301
00:13:26,436 --> 00:13:28,399
Starting from the definition
of the altitude

302
00:13:28,636 --> 00:13:30,224
which is the vertical distance

303
00:13:30,424 --> 00:13:31,661
which separates a point from the relief

304
00:13:31,861 --> 00:13:33,561
of the surface of the earth geoid

305
00:13:33,924 --> 00:13:36,011
we learnt about three methods

306
00:13:36,211 --> 00:13:37,636
that allow the measure

307
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:39,449
the geometric leveling,

308
00:13:39,949 --> 00:13:41,324
the photogrammetry

309
00:13:41,524 --> 00:13:43,849
and the laser scanning altimetry.

310
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,886
The latter establishes the advent

311
00:13:47,086 --> 00:13:48,924
of the new acquisition technologies

312
00:13:49,324 --> 00:13:51,824
that allow to produce
digital altitude models

313
00:13:52,024 --> 00:13:53,349
of a very accurate precision

314
00:13:53,549 --> 00:13:55,936
and which enable
the study of the micro-relief

315
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:57,949
that the biologists, geologists,

316
00:13:58,149 --> 00:13:59,886
archaeologists or planners

317
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:02,761
can now enjoy.
