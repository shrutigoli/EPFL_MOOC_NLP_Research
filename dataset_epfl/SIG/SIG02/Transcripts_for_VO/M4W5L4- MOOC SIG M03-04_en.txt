00:00:30,749 --> 00:00:32,548
Hello, and welcome to this lesson 

2
00:00:32,761 --> 00:00:34,462
devoted to map dressing

3
00:00:34,662 --> 00:00:36,462
and the QGIS print dialer,

4
00:00:36,662 --> 00:00:38,512
the tool that enables to produce

5
00:00:38,712 --> 00:00:40,137
cartographic documents.

6
00:00:40,587 --> 00:00:42,936
The theoretical information
concerning the dressing

7
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:45,249
has been presented to you during
the first lesson

8
00:00:45,424 --> 00:00:48,662
of this last module about the
components of the map.

9
00:00:48,862 --> 00:00:51,412
Here we will mainly focus on

10
00:00:51,612 --> 00:00:54,224
its implementation, thanks to
the functions of the dialer.

11
00:00:55,512 --> 00:00:56,398
The goals of this lesson

12
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:57,824
are to remind you on one hand

13
00:00:57,999 --> 00:00:59,574
what the wrapping of a thematic map is

14
00:00:59,849 --> 00:01:00,923
and what its role is.

15
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:03,399
On the other hand, we will present

16
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:04,486
the main functions

17
00:01:04,686 --> 00:01:06,137
of the QGIS print dialer,

18
00:01:06,337 --> 00:01:08,086
which allows to lay out maps

19
00:01:08,286 --> 00:01:10,149
and to edit them to some extent

20
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:11,898
for printing

21
00:01:12,336 --> 00:01:13,736
or with the aim of producing files

22
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:16,798
in JPEG, PNG or PDF format for example

23
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:18,710
for electronic publication.

24
00:01:19,773 --> 00:01:20,523
After this lesson,

25
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:23,323
you will be able to use appropriately

26
00:01:23,523 --> 00:01:25,048
wrapping elements of map

27
00:01:25,248 --> 00:01:26,160
to lay it out,

28
00:01:26,585 --> 00:01:28,610
and to export cartographic documents

29
00:01:28,811 --> 00:01:30,536
from the QGIS print dialer

30
00:01:30,736 --> 00:01:31,923
in an image format

31
00:01:32,323 --> 00:01:33,973
or in a vectorial format.

32
00:01:44,811 --> 00:01:46,223
We have already mentioned the fact

33
00:01:46,398 --> 00:01:49,635
that the signal constituted by
a cartographic representation

34
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,273
must be accompanied by a number
of components.

35
00:01:52,498 --> 00:01:54,936
The components are part of
what is known as

36
00:01:55,136 --> 00:01:56,286
the map wrapping.

37
00:01:56,923 --> 00:01:58,222
Amongst the wrapping elements,

38
00:01:58,435 --> 00:02:01,036
some must accompany the map

39
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:03,411
and the use of others depends
on the context.

40
00:02:04,248 --> 00:02:05,598
This is what we have attempted
to summarize

41
00:02:05,773 --> 00:02:06,661
in this table.

42
00:02:07,198 --> 00:02:09,436
But we should note that
certain components

43
00:02:09,636 --> 00:02:11,923
are presented as compulsory
according to certain authors

44
00:02:12,748 --> 00:02:14,210
whilst they are not for others.

45
00:02:14,923 --> 00:02:17,335
And it is in fact a combination
of the aims pursued

46
00:02:17,535 --> 00:02:19,061
and the context of the publication

47
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:22,210
which will help determining
the correct composition of the map.

48
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,123
However, a majority of cartographers

49
00:02:25,323 --> 00:02:26,898
agrees that the following elements

50
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:29,248
constitute the mandatory wrapping.

51
00:02:30,298 --> 00:02:32,248
First, a title and a subtitle

52
00:02:32,998 --> 00:02:34,385
second, the year of production

53
00:02:34,585 --> 00:02:36,261
of the statistic and spatial data,

54
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,336
then a key

55
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:40,722
containing the description of
the indicators

56
00:02:40,897 --> 00:02:42,111
then a graphic scale

57
00:02:42,948 --> 00:02:44,386
an indication of the orientation,

58
00:02:44,586 --> 00:02:47,310
and by default the North is located
at the top of the map,

59
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:49,660
then the data source,

60
00:02:50,797 --> 00:02:52,848
the names of the authors and
any indications

61
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:53,998
related to copyright

62
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:56,523
and finally, the year of
creation of the map.

63
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,048
The role of wrapping

64
00:02:59,223 --> 00:03:00,598
is to complete the map

65
00:03:00,786 --> 00:03:03,149
in order to allow the best
possible understanding.

66
00:03:03,686 --> 00:03:04,524
And with this in mind,

67
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:08,261
a thematic map should not be
presented to the reader

68
00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:10,948
without providing the
information on

69
00:03:11,148 --> 00:03:11,774
the geographical context

70
00:03:12,173 --> 00:03:14,848
nor without taking into account

71
00:03:15,035 --> 00:03:15,923
the aesthetic aspects of
the representation.

72
00:03:17,385 --> 00:03:20,611
Each represented territory has
a geographical context.

73
00:03:20,811 --> 00:03:23,511
That means that it is contiguous
to other regions

74
00:03:23,698 --> 00:03:24,598
or other countries,

75
00:03:24,785 --> 00:03:25,986
that it can be crossed

76
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:27,786
by structuring geographical elements,

77
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:29,899
such as rivers, lakes

78
00:03:30,086 --> 00:03:31,036
mountain chains,

79
00:03:31,236 --> 00:03:33,511
big cities, roads

80
00:03:34,235 --> 00:03:35,886
or major railway axes.

81
00:03:36,961 --> 00:03:38,911
These elements can be useful to the reader

82
00:03:39,111 --> 00:03:40,523
for the spatial location on one hand

83
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:42,836
but also to better understand the reality

84
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:45,186
of a socio-economic situation,
for example.

85
00:03:45,986 --> 00:03:48,361
It is therefore important
to include on the maps

86
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,561
the few elements of
geographical context

87
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:52,874
which will promote the reading,

88
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:55,086
and the comprehension of
the phenomenon represented

89
00:03:55,723 --> 00:03:58,311
whilst taking care not to overload
the document

90
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:00,973
and to preserve the
readability at the maximum.

91
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:04,473
The aesthetic of cartographic
documents produced

92
00:04:04,698 --> 00:04:06,023
rests on three pillars

93
00:04:06,211 --> 00:04:09,274
that are the harmony, the composition
and the clarity.

94
00:04:10,461 --> 00:04:12,411
The harmony is the relation
that has to be weaved

95
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:13,961
between the elements of the map

96
00:04:14,485 --> 00:04:16,511
in order to produce a
homogeneous signal.

97
00:04:17,248 --> 00:04:19,786
It is the visual balance between
all the elements

98
00:04:20,486 --> 00:04:22,099
which will constitute a whole.

99
00:04:23,273 --> 00:04:24,661
The composition refers

100
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:26,574
to the arrangement of the
elements on the map.

101
00:04:27,148 --> 00:04:29,548
It is about laying out the
components of the map

102
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:32,148
by organizing and prioritizing them

103
00:04:32,585 --> 00:04:34,273
depending on their informative value

104
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,674
and by using the space
available at best

105
00:04:36,874 --> 00:04:37,736
around the map.

106
00:04:39,099 --> 00:04:41,198
The clarity depends on the coherence

107
00:04:41,398 --> 00:04:42,224
of the choice of colors,

108
00:04:42,424 --> 00:04:44,923
on the sobriety in the
choice of fonts

109
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,373
and on the optimization of the
arrangement of the wrapping elements

110
00:04:48,648 --> 00:04:49,661
in the space available.

111
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:51,811
The clarity is measured directly

112
00:04:52,061 --> 00:04:54,524
by the ease with which the reader

113
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:55,849
will be able to decode the signal.

114
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:58,549
We can also point out that
the finalization

115
00:04:58,761 --> 00:04:59,635
of aesthetic aspects

116
00:04:59,836 --> 00:05:01,686
can be added during a retouching phase

117
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,924
which is carried out in a graphic
editing software

118
00:05:05,248 --> 00:05:06,161
like Inkscape.

119
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,273
This phase requires

120
00:05:08,486 --> 00:05:10,586
the document to be exported
beforehand

121
00:05:10,774 --> 00:05:12,686
in a vectorial format like PDF.

122
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:14,373
We will not discuss it here

123
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:17,098
and we will focus on
the available functions

124
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:18,611
in the print dialer.

125
00:05:27,973 --> 00:05:29,998
We will now apply these
different notions

126
00:05:30,236 --> 00:05:31,073
related to the wrapping

127
00:05:31,286 --> 00:05:33,198
in the QGIS print dialer.

128
00:05:33,985 --> 00:05:35,974
The actions described in the
following sequence

129
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:38,386
allow to recreate, step by step

130
00:05:38,848 --> 00:05:40,498
the map of the spatial distribution

131
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:42,561
of the homicide rate
in american counties

132
00:05:43,048 --> 00:05:44,073
which we have presented

133
00:05:44,248 --> 00:05:45,674
in the lessons on the components

134
00:05:45,886 --> 00:05:46,974
and the functions of the map.

135
00:05:49,061 --> 00:05:52,011
The creation and implementation
of a map in QGIS

136
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:53,711
is done in the print dialer.

137
00:05:55,061 --> 00:05:57,199
We can create a new print dialer

138
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,224
from the "project" menu

139
00:05:58,923 --> 00:06:01,036
and then, "new print dialer"

140
00:06:01,949 --> 00:06:03,673
and "manage the existing dialers"

141
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:05,136
always in the "projects" menu

142
00:06:05,748 --> 00:06:07,723
then "composition manager".

143
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,899
For example, here we
can delete the "map 1"

144
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,111
dialer, which already exists.

145
00:06:16,923 --> 00:06:17,786
We will now

146
00:06:18,036 --> 00:06:19,549
create a new dialer

147
00:06:19,749 --> 00:06:20,586
called "map 1"

148
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:22,286
to lay out

149
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:24,823
the homicide rate map in
the United States.

150
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,410
To start with,

151
00:06:28,073 --> 00:06:29,561
in order for your dialer

152
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:32,760
to present the same tool bars as
what is shown on the screen,

153
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:35,936
go to the "view" menu

154
00:06:37,073 --> 00:06:38,748
and tick "all the options"

155
00:06:38,923 --> 00:06:41,110
under "panels" and "toolbars".

156
00:06:42,348 --> 00:06:44,111
You should then have access

157
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:46,361
to different toolbars on the left

158
00:06:46,636 --> 00:06:47,923
and on the top of the window

159
00:06:48,247 --> 00:06:50,647
and to panels with different options

160
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,647
on the right.

161
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:56,810
In the main toolbar,

162
00:06:57,385 --> 00:06:58,748
we first find the tools

163
00:06:59,161 --> 00:07:00,973
allowing to manage the print dialers,

164
00:07:01,585 --> 00:07:02,586
to create a new one

165
00:07:02,786 --> 00:07:03,948
or to save the project.

166
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:08,135
We will see the other tools later.

167
00:07:09,711 --> 00:07:10,360
To start with,

168
00:07:10,985 --> 00:07:14,160
we will add the current map of
our QGIS project

169
00:07:14,423 --> 00:07:16,998
thanks to the "add a new map" tool.

170
00:07:18,423 --> 00:07:20,473
The "object properties" panel

171
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:22,347
allows us to lay out this map.

172
00:07:24,236 --> 00:07:26,923
First, by defining the
scale of the map

173
00:07:29,248 --> 00:07:31,048
then under the "hold" tab

174
00:07:31,635 --> 00:07:32,823
it is possible to determine

175
00:07:33,048 --> 00:07:35,098
what geographical extent will be
represented.

176
00:07:36,772 --> 00:07:39,123
It is also possible to
modify this extent

177
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:42,135
by moving the content
of the map directly

178
00:07:42,348 --> 00:07:44,948
with the "move object content" tool.

179
00:07:46,486 --> 00:07:47,361
We will now

180
00:07:47,623 --> 00:07:50,398
add a graticule and display
coordinates.

181
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,398
Under the "graticule" tab,

182
00:07:54,285 --> 00:07:55,636
we choose the type of grid,

183
00:07:56,911 --> 00:07:57,361
the unit

184
00:07:58,248 --> 00:07:59,573
and the size of the intervals

185
00:08:02,573 --> 00:08:03,972
and finally, the type of line.

186
00:08:06,298 --> 00:08:08,236
It is also possible to add a frame

187
00:08:08,661 --> 00:08:09,985
and display the coordinates.

188
00:08:11,410 --> 00:08:12,986
Here we will display the coordinates

189
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:14,823
in degrees, minutes and seconds.

190
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:18,011
on the left and at the
bottom of the map.

191
00:08:19,223 --> 00:08:20,998
We deactivate the display

192
00:08:21,198 --> 00:08:22,072
for the right and the top

193
00:08:22,447 --> 00:08:24,148
and we choose to display
the coordinates

194
00:08:24,473 --> 00:08:25,710
either outside the map

195
00:08:26,235 --> 00:08:27,448
or inside the frame.

196
00:08:30,398 --> 00:08:32,397
Under the "position and size" tab,

197
00:08:32,985 --> 00:08:34,361
we will center the map

198
00:08:34,561 --> 00:08:35,748
in the middle of the page

199
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,360
with a margin of 4 millimeters
on all sides.

200
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,261
We define the margins

201
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,661
of 4 millimeters in x and y

202
00:08:44,011 --> 00:08:46,685
and we then define the width
and height of the map,

203
00:08:47,498 --> 00:08:49,223
calculated here from the dimensions

204
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:52,948
of the A4 format minus the margins
of 4 millimeters.

205
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:56,723
It is possible to display
a frame around the map

206
00:08:56,986 --> 00:08:59,060
and to change its color and thickness.

207
00:09:00,886 --> 00:09:03,873
Finally, we can choose the color
of the map background

208
00:09:04,073 --> 00:09:07,136
and possibly work with the transparency.

209
00:09:10,848 --> 00:09:12,960
Once the main map laid out,

210
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:16,785
the different wrapping
elements must be added.

211
00:09:18,061 --> 00:09:19,735
This means inserting a ladder,

212
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:23,210
the orientation, a key, sources, etc.

213
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:27,148
To begin with, we will display the scale.

214
00:09:27,986 --> 00:09:29,510
In the "layout" menu,

215
00:09:29,885 --> 00:09:31,973
we choose "add a graphic scale"

216
00:09:32,798 --> 00:09:34,111
or we click directly

217
00:09:34,286 --> 00:09:36,111
on the corresponding tool
in the toolbar.

218
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:38,848
When we click on the map,

219
00:09:39,498 --> 00:09:41,761
a scale is displayed with
default settings.

220
00:09:42,998 --> 00:09:46,035
In the "object properties"
we can modify the scale type,

221
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:49,085
the units, the length displayed,
the size of the object.

222
00:09:50,336 --> 00:09:52,860
It is also possible to modify
other parameters

223
00:09:53,035 --> 00:09:55,435
related to the font in particular.

224
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:00,898
We will now add a key.

225
00:10:02,086 --> 00:10:05,611
In "layout", we choose "add a key"

226
00:10:06,548 --> 00:10:08,161
and click on the map again.

227
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:12,686
In the properties, it is possible
to define the title,

228
00:10:13,273 --> 00:10:16,347
here the "spatial distribution of
homicides in the United States".

229
00:10:17,986 --> 00:10:19,923
Under "key objects",

230
00:10:20,123 --> 00:10:22,411
by deselecting "auto update",

231
00:10:22,611 --> 00:10:24,110
It is possible to choose

232
00:10:24,285 --> 00:10:26,461
the layers for which the key
will be displayed.

233
00:10:27,573 --> 00:10:30,186
We therefore delete the layers
which we do not wish to see appearing.

234
00:10:32,011 --> 00:10:33,386
The name of the layer corresponds

235
00:10:33,586 --> 00:10:35,110
to the layer title in the key.

236
00:10:35,923 --> 00:10:38,598
To modify it, select the layer

237
00:10:38,798 --> 00:10:40,173
then click on the pencil icon.

238
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,986
We can then insert the desired text
for the subtitle.

239
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:50,723
Text fonts can be customized.

240
00:10:51,936 --> 00:10:53,586
To insert a new line,

241
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:56,098
it is necessary to define a
particular character

242
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:58,198
which will not be used in the text

243
00:10:58,386 --> 00:11:00,685
but which will indicate the
position of the word-wraps.

244
00:11:02,485 --> 00:11:04,673
we choose the dollar sign here.

245
00:11:05,598 --> 00:11:08,023
The character must then be
inserted in the text

246
00:11:08,223 --> 00:11:10,260
at the desired location,
for the word-wrap.

247
00:11:12,785 --> 00:11:15,623
Finally, we will display a fine frame

248
00:11:15,798 --> 00:11:17,036
around the key

249
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:19,785
and put a white background
with a little transparency.

250
00:11:24,748 --> 00:11:26,698
Then, to display the orientation

251
00:11:27,486 --> 00:11:28,747
we have to get an image.

252
00:11:29,736 --> 00:11:31,735
In the "layout" menu,

253
00:11:31,935 --> 00:11:34,234
we choose "display an image"

254
00:11:35,022 --> 00:11:36,810
then draw a rectangle on the map

255
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,373
to determine its location.

256
00:11:39,585 --> 00:11:41,623
We can then either load images

257
00:11:41,823 --> 00:11:43,135
from a personal file,

258
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:46,310
or use predefined QGIS directories

259
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:49,373
in which pictograms are
already available.

260
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:53,810
Here we will choose an arrow that
indicates the direction of the North.

261
00:11:55,060 --> 00:11:58,610
The image can easily be
resized and moved.

262
00:12:02,473 --> 00:12:04,060
One of the last display options

263
00:12:04,235 --> 00:12:05,547
which we have not yet used

264
00:12:05,747 --> 00:12:08,635
in the "layout" menu is
the label display.

265
00:12:08,973 --> 00:12:11,635
This tool allows to insert text boxes.

266
00:12:12,598 --> 00:12:14,135
We will use it first

267
00:12:14,335 --> 00:12:16,223
to add country names on the map

268
00:12:16,423 --> 00:12:17,910
like Canada first...

269
00:12:21,673 --> 00:12:23,423
then the Pacific Ocean ...

270
00:12:24,298 --> 00:12:27,285
The color and the text
fonts can be changed

271
00:12:27,485 --> 00:12:28,660
in the "object properties".

272
00:12:35,523 --> 00:12:38,122
In the "rotation" tab we can easily

273
00:12:38,335 --> 00:12:39,748
tilt the text as desired.

274
00:12:41,472 --> 00:12:42,560
For each of these elements,

275
00:12:43,073 --> 00:12:45,685
we could also display a frame,
a background,

276
00:12:45,873 --> 00:12:47,335
or use transparency

277
00:12:47,885 --> 00:12:49,197
as we have seen previously

278
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,410
for other objects.

279
00:12:52,273 --> 00:12:54,673
An element can also be
copied and pasted

280
00:12:54,985 --> 00:12:57,910
with the usual commands, control C,
control V.

281
00:12:59,698 --> 00:13:01,709
We will also use the labels

282
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:04,147
to display a comment that describes
the map.

283
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,935
The text can be copied and pasted
into the designated space.

284
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:16,173
We will add two more text boxes.

285
00:13:16,748 --> 00:13:19,435
The name of the author of the map
as well as the sources,

286
00:13:19,635 --> 00:13:20,534
and references.

287
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:24,273
These elements can be displayed

288
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:26,285
more discreetly on the map.

289
00:13:28,623 --> 00:13:30,060
To finish our map,

290
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,623
we will display a box

291
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:35,248
showing a zoom on the New York area.

292
00:13:35,997 --> 00:13:38,998
To do this, we will first lock
the main map

293
00:13:39,198 --> 00:13:41,822
so that the changes made in
the QGIS project

294
00:13:42,185 --> 00:13:45,123
do not reverberate on the main map.

295
00:13:46,973 --> 00:13:49,934
Then, in the QGIS project,
we zoom in on the area of ​​interest.

296
00:13:55,335 --> 00:13:57,372
Coming back to the print dialer,

297
00:13:57,673 --> 00:13:59,960
we can add a new map

298
00:14:00,697 --> 00:14:02,647
which will represent the enlarged area.

299
00:14:04,785 --> 00:14:06,997
To put this map in the foreground,

300
00:14:07,298 --> 00:14:09,535
we just have to change the
order of superposition

301
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:11,135
in the "elements" panel.

302
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:14,672
This map is now ready

303
00:14:15,098 --> 00:14:18,285
and we will proceed to
the printing and exporting.

304
00:14:19,785 --> 00:14:21,797
Different options are available

305
00:14:22,585 --> 00:14:26,848
including the choice between
the JPEG or PNG image format

306
00:14:27,335 --> 00:14:31,097
or the vectorial format,
in SVG or PDF.

307
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:34,747
In the "composition" panel,

308
00:14:35,185 --> 00:14:38,135
it is possible to set the paper
size and orientation

309
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:40,785
as well as the resolution of the export.

310
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:44,085
It is important to clearly define
this resolution

311
00:14:44,285 --> 00:14:46,397
in order to obtain a good
quality impression.

312
00:14:48,135 --> 00:14:50,623
Here we will export a PDF

313
00:14:50,823 --> 00:14:52,773
and a PNG image.

314
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:58,460
For the PDF, a message suggests
us to use an image format

315
00:14:58,648 --> 00:15:00,473
to retain the transparency effect.

316
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:04,048
This does not matter because, often,

317
00:15:04,248 --> 00:15:06,448
an exported PDF file is then edited

318
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:09,773
in a graphic editing software
like Inkscape.

319
00:15:11,985 --> 00:15:13,747
A glance at the two files created

320
00:15:13,948 --> 00:15:16,760
allows us to verify that
the exporting operations

321
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,260
have been successfully completed.

322
00:15:34,797 --> 00:15:36,322
We are at the end of this lesson

323
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:38,210
dedicated to cartography wrapping

324
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,947
and the use of the QGIS print dialer.

325
00:15:41,672 --> 00:15:43,935
We explained to you the
role of wrapping 

326
00:15:44,122 --> 00:15:45,672
and presented the main functions

327
00:15:45,872 --> 00:15:46,560
of the dialer.

328
00:15:46,897 --> 00:15:49,847
In particular, you learned how
to compose a cartographic document

329
00:15:50,097 --> 00:15:51,897
to size a graphic scale,

330
00:15:52,122 --> 00:15:54,422
to edit a key, to add an orientation,

331
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,485
to place a comment box

332
00:15:56,685 --> 00:16:00,097
and to zoom in on a particular
region of interest.

333
00:16:00,985 --> 00:16:03,897
And finally, we saw how to prepare
the maps

334
00:16:04,097 --> 00:16:05,935
for the printing, and how to export them

335
00:16:06,110 --> 00:16:07,010
in different formats

336
00:16:07,485 --> 00:16:10,747
including vectorial formats that
can be reworked

337
00:16:10,947 --> 00:16:12,710
in graphic editing software.
