00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:24,497
Hello and welcome to this lesson

2
00:00:24,697 --> 00:00:26,918
which focuses on flood risk mapping

3
00:00:27,118 --> 00:00:28,321
in Niamey, Niger.

4
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:29,783
This lesson,

5
00:00:29,983 --> 00:00:31,373
which is a case study,

6
00:00:31,573 --> 00:00:33,984
shows how to use the GIS

7
00:00:34,184 --> 00:00:37,304
to map the flood plains

8
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:40,881
in order to make decisions
on the town planning.

9
00:00:41,081 --> 00:00:41,868
Indeed,

10
00:00:42,068 --> 00:00:44,201
the recent and recurrent floods

11
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:45,456
of the last 15 years

12
00:00:45,656 --> 00:00:49,038
have resurrected in the memory
of the inhabitants of Niamey,

13
00:00:49,238 --> 00:00:50,640
a sahelian region,

14
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,364
the risks of flooding.

15
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,534
Thus, the only logical explanation

16
00:00:55,734 --> 00:00:57,193
for the increase in flooding

17
00:00:57,393 --> 00:00:58,712
must be sought

18
00:00:58,912 --> 00:01:01,008
in the increasing vulnerability
of populations

19
00:01:01,208 --> 00:01:02,978
to the Niger river overflowings

20
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:05,959
and the runoffs after torrential rains,

21
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,125
especially in urban extensions

22
00:01:08,325 --> 00:01:09,721
close to the banks of the river.

23
00:01:10,835 --> 00:01:12,824
This lesson is based

24
00:01:13,024 --> 00:01:16,458
on the analysis of
hydrometeorological mechanisms

25
00:01:16,658 --> 00:01:18,383
and human occupation.

26
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:21,054
But this study does not

27
00:01:21,254 --> 00:01:22,891
allow to address the problem of
the floods in Niamey

28
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:24,860
in all its facets.

29
00:01:25,055 --> 00:01:25,753
However,

30
00:01:25,953 --> 00:01:28,877
it helps to propose to the
competent authorities

31
00:01:29,077 --> 00:01:30,351
some cartographic tools

32
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:32,963
that can guide them towards
a better management

33
00:01:33,163 --> 00:01:34,935
of the flooding risk.

34
00:01:35,854 --> 00:01:38,657
This lesson aims to illustrate

35
00:01:38,857 --> 00:01:41,313
the use of geographic
information systems

36
00:01:41,513 --> 00:01:43,141
for the spatial assessment

37
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:45,674
of flood risk in Niamey,

38
00:01:45,874 --> 00:01:48,438
a sahelian city of the
extreme West of Niger,

39
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:49,264
on one hand,

40
00:01:49,464 --> 00:01:52,794
and to exploit the flood plain maps

41
00:01:52,994 --> 00:01:55,708
as tools for decision-making
on the other hand.

42
00:01:56,465 --> 00:01:58,934
What are the main sections of this lesson?

43
00:02:08,063 --> 00:02:08,789
To start with,

44
00:02:08,989 --> 00:02:12,258
we must first remember that Niamey
is the capital of Niger.

45
00:02:14,147 --> 00:02:17,115
The city of Niamey, located in
the extreme West of the country,

46
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:21,684
with approximately 1,300,000
inhabitants in 2011,

47
00:02:21,884 --> 00:02:25,549
extends over an area of 240 kilometers

48
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:29,396
at altitudes ranging from
180 to 250 meters.

49
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,916
It is cut in two by the river Niger,

50
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:34,772
which has shaped

51
00:02:34,972 --> 00:02:37,592
the development of the urban
and peri-urban fabric.

52
00:02:38,167 --> 00:02:40,792
We can distinguish a left bank

53
00:02:40,992 --> 00:02:43,986
more developed than the right bank.

54
00:02:44,186 --> 00:02:45,738
The left bank

55
00:02:45,938 --> 00:02:48,779
which houses four districts

56
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:51,553
is a plateau that overhangs the river

57
00:02:51,753 --> 00:02:54,113
at an average height of 220 meters

58
00:02:54,372 --> 00:02:56,881
and cut by numerous talwegs,

59
00:02:57,081 --> 00:03:00,854
the most important of which
is that of Gountou Yéna,

60
00:03:01,054 --> 00:03:02,616
in the North-South direction.

61
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:06,122
As for the right bank where
the commune 5 is,

62
00:03:06,322 --> 00:03:08,000
it is an alluvial plain

63
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,287
with an average altitude
of 200 meters.

64
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,815
The physiographic characteristics
of the city of Niamey

65
00:03:14,015 --> 00:03:17,060
and the various associated
human and economic issues

66
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,659
show that floods

67
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:20,586
are mostly directly linked

68
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:23,781
to the strong human growth
of the last 30 years.

69
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:24,869
Indeed,

70
00:03:25,069 --> 00:03:26,321
the population growth

71
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:28,804
and the development of
socio-economic activities have

72
00:03:29,004 --> 00:03:32,625
led the city to expand into
flood-risk areas.

73
00:03:32,825 --> 00:03:36,108
Thus, since the early 1970s,

74
00:03:36,308 --> 00:03:40,046
Niamey has been developed
on the right bank of the river

75
00:03:40,246 --> 00:03:41,883
and the urbanization of this

76
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,214
particularly exposed

77
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:45,689
site is currently continuing.

78
00:03:46,596 --> 00:03:47,507
On the left bank,

79
00:03:47,707 --> 00:03:49,980
the former districts of
Goudel and Saga,

80
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:50,900
which are very vulnerable,

81
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,524
are densifying and spreading
by new building plots.

82
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,613
The spatial assessment
of the flooding risk

83
00:03:57,813 --> 00:04:00,002
by crossing of the hazard

84
00:04:00,202 --> 00:04:01,535
and the vulnerability of the stakes

85
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:04,492
allows to map the areas
at risk of flooding

86
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:06,029
in the city of Niamey.

87
00:04:16,137 --> 00:04:19,151
Floods are natural disasters

88
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:21,168
causing damage to people

89
00:04:21,368 --> 00:04:22,918
every year,

90
00:04:23,118 --> 00:04:26,063
including the deaths of
hundreds of millions of people,

91
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:28,226
damage to the environment

92
00:04:28,426 --> 00:04:30,701
and destruction of
goods and infrastructure

93
00:04:30,901 --> 00:04:33,057
estimated at billions of CFA francs.

94
00:04:34,063 --> 00:04:35,681
The frequency of floods

95
00:04:36,374 --> 00:04:37,575
has been increasing in the world

96
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,108
over the last few years,

97
00:04:39,308 --> 00:04:41,647
probably in relation to climate change.

98
00:04:41,847 --> 00:04:43,527
This subject is therefore topical.

99
00:04:43,727 --> 00:04:45,281
and deserves to be considered

100
00:04:45,481 --> 00:04:49,100
for a better management
of the flood risk.

101
00:04:50,902 --> 00:04:52,938
The floods in the sahelian regions

102
00:04:53,138 --> 00:04:54,880
have become increasingly recurrent

103
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,442
and Niger is not spared.

104
00:04:57,305 --> 00:04:58,526
In recent years,

105
00:04:58,726 --> 00:05:01,433
Niger has experienced an
excess pluviometry

106
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:02,963
with torrential rains

107
00:05:03,163 --> 00:05:05,646
causing unprecedented flooding

108
00:05:05,846 --> 00:05:07,971
in practically all parts of the country

109
00:05:08,171 --> 00:05:09,858
including Niamey, the capital.

110
00:05:10,817 --> 00:05:12,940
The protective dikes in Niamey,

111
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,918
about five meters high,

112
00:05:15,118 --> 00:05:16,194
on the right bank

113
00:05:16,394 --> 00:05:18,768
have been totally submerged

114
00:05:18,968 --> 00:05:21,161
during the last flood.

115
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,561
These floods cause many deaths,

116
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:27,551
population displacement and rehousing,

117
00:05:28,016 --> 00:05:30,257
destruction of habitats and fields.

118
00:05:31,543 --> 00:05:34,281
The hydrology of the Niger
river in Niamey

119
00:05:34,512 --> 00:05:37,662
is well known thanks to the
Niamey measurement station

120
00:05:37,862 --> 00:05:39,559
installed since 1928

121
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:42,565
and regularly followed since 1944.

122
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:45,657
The hydrological regime
has two floods.

123
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:48,100
There is the malian flood

124
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,828
which takes place from
December to January

125
00:05:51,028 --> 00:05:53,054
from the top of the basin

126
00:05:54,148 --> 00:05:55,496
and the local flood

127
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:58,198
that occurs during the rainy season.

128
00:05:59,218 --> 00:06:00,579
Over the last years,

129
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:03,502
the local flood has
become increasingly important

130
00:06:03,702 --> 00:06:05,886
as you can see on the graph

131
00:06:06,739 --> 00:06:10,693
and it is the cause of frequent
floods during the rainy season.

132
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,372
Local floods

133
00:06:13,572 --> 00:06:15,372
are most often caused

134
00:06:15,572 --> 00:06:17,701
by exceptional pluviometry peaks.

135
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:19,459
In August 2012,

136
00:06:19,659 --> 00:06:21,446
the daily peak of 121 millimeters

137
00:06:21,646 --> 00:06:22,901
caused 28 deaths,

138
00:06:23,101 --> 00:06:24,829
more than 51,000 victims,

139
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:26,907
more than 4,500 houses

140
00:06:27,107 --> 00:06:29,951
and more than 250 hectares
of fields destroyed.

141
00:06:30,857 --> 00:06:33,802
The analysis of the daily
pluviometric peaks in Niamey

142
00:06:34,002 --> 00:06:36,081
reveals a large amplitude

143
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:38,598
of the maximum daily peak variability

144
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:41,167
for the months of July and August,

145
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:43,789
ranging from 7 to 121 millimeters

146
00:06:43,989 --> 00:06:46,226
with peaks at 50 millimeters per day

147
00:06:46,426 --> 00:06:49,369
reached or exceeded almost
every year since 2000.

148
00:06:50,845 --> 00:06:54,034
What are the aggravating
factors of these floods?

149
00:06:55,127 --> 00:06:56,352
We will look at

150
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:59,060
the factors that are
generated by humans.

151
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,668
It is the waterproofing

152
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:03,184
and the soil degradation,

153
00:07:03,384 --> 00:07:08,335
particularly in connection with
the deforestation and the urbanization,

154
00:07:08,929 --> 00:07:11,059
which leads to less infiltration

155
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:13,178
and more runoff.

156
00:07:14,028 --> 00:07:15,305
Otherwise important

157
00:07:15,505 --> 00:07:17,140
is the spreading of the city of Niamey

158
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:18,871
in the main bed of the,

159
00:07:19,496 --> 00:07:22,094
which accentuates the
vulnerability of the city,

160
00:07:22,855 --> 00:07:24,540
and the chronic failing of
the maintenance of waterways

161
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,857
which leads to the river bed
being blocked with sand

162
00:07:28,057 --> 00:07:30,193
should be added.

163
00:07:31,887 --> 00:07:34,601
In the light of the different
causes of flooding

164
00:07:34,801 --> 00:07:36,522
and of the victims recorded each year,

165
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,715
several measures can be envisaged

166
00:07:38,915 --> 00:07:41,014
to combat the phenomenon of flooding,

167
00:07:41,214 --> 00:07:43,856
in particular management
measures on one hand

168
00:07:44,056 --> 00:07:46,720
and preventive measures on the other.

169
00:07:47,814 --> 00:07:50,172
Regarding the development measures,

170
00:07:50,372 --> 00:07:51,857
it is essential

171
00:07:52,057 --> 00:07:54,212
to preserve the waterway area

172
00:07:54,412 --> 00:07:56,345
and also to avoid

173
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:59,124
to colonize the flood zones.

174
00:08:00,075 --> 00:08:03,000
It is also necessary to

175
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,973
develop the banks to construct dikes,

176
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:09,254
to dredge the major bed

177
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:11,868
to improve the flow capacity

178
00:08:12,068 --> 00:08:13,694
in the riverbed,

179
00:08:14,565 --> 00:08:17,887
to improve the infiltrability
of the soils,

180
00:08:18,087 --> 00:08:20,020
which will allow

181
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,244
to reduce the runoff.

182
00:08:24,312 --> 00:08:25,076
So,

183
00:08:25,276 --> 00:08:28,557
regarding the prevention measures

184
00:08:29,878 --> 00:08:31,914
there is the town planning

185
00:08:32,114 --> 00:08:33,442
and the danger mapping,

186
00:08:34,877 --> 00:08:37,439
the flood modeling

187
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:39,804
and the establishment of warning systems.

188
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:44,338
These measures show
the need to collect data,

189
00:08:44,538 --> 00:08:46,240
to modelize the phenomenon

190
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,816
and to map the risk of flooding,

191
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:52,941
this mapping is the
interest of this work.

192
00:09:03,394 --> 00:09:05,328
What is the methodological
approach to adopt?

193
00:09:06,164 --> 00:09:08,826
Two types of flood-related factors

194
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:11,080
are distinguished by flood risk

195
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,310
stuy approaches.

196
00:09:12,855 --> 00:09:16,755
There are the natural factors
controlling the hazard,

197
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:18,583
such as the topography,

198
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:20,830
which provides information on the slope,

199
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:25,633
the altitude, the hydrology,
the meteorology,

200
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:28,154
the geology and the hydrogeology.

201
00:09:28,736 --> 00:09:30,593
And also the anthropic factors

202
00:09:30,793 --> 00:09:33,553
which concern the occupation
of the ground and the buildings.

203
00:09:34,471 --> 00:09:36,124
Thus, several types of data

204
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:39,900
will be necessary for the spatial
analysis of the flood risk.

205
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,806
It is the satellite images,

206
00:09:42,006 --> 00:09:43,836
maps, ground data,

207
00:09:44,036 --> 00:09:46,365
statistical data, and so on.

208
00:09:47,314 --> 00:09:49,109
We need to remember
that the notion of risk

209
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:51,128
is perceived as the possible occurrence

210
00:09:51,328 --> 00:09:53,666
of a hazard on potentially
vulnerable issues.

211
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,363
The study of the flood risk

212
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:57,297
is based on two main points:

213
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,383
First, the analysis of the hazards

214
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:01,807
concerning the knowledge of
natural phenomena

215
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:03,506
causing the damages,

216
00:10:03,706 --> 00:10:06,147
their process and their functioning.

217
00:10:06,694 --> 00:10:07,496
In this case,

218
00:10:07,696 --> 00:10:10,030
it is necessary to analyze
the morphological,

219
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,364
topographical, geological,

220
00:10:12,564 --> 00:10:14,283
pedological and hydraulic

221
00:10:14,483 --> 00:10:15,600
characteristics controlling
the phenomenon.

222
00:10:16,132 --> 00:10:16,837
Secondly,

223
00:10:17,037 --> 00:10:19,305
the mapping and assessment

224
00:10:19,505 --> 00:10:21,983
of vulnerabilities and major issues.

225
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:23,499
The aim is to integrate

226
00:10:23,699 --> 00:10:26,526
data on anthropogenic and
socio-economic activities

227
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:29,191
into the flood risk assessment,

228
00:10:29,391 --> 00:10:31,263
whilst knowing that the risk of flooding

229
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:34,002
is primarily a social object.

230
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:35,407
These two map,

231
00:10:35,607 --> 00:10:36,755
that is to say the hazard map

232
00:10:36,955 --> 00:10:38,153
and the stakes map,

233
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:42,610
are combined to determine
flood plains.

234
00:10:43,646 --> 00:10:45,989
It is a decision-making tool

235
00:10:46,189 --> 00:10:48,564
for the town planning.

236
00:10:50,478 --> 00:10:52,646
The mapping of the flood hazard

237
00:10:52,846 --> 00:10:55,563
is based on the analysis
of natural factors,

238
00:10:55,763 --> 00:10:59,139
including the morphology,
the topography,

239
00:10:59,339 --> 00:11:01,277
the geology and the pedology,

240
00:11:01,477 --> 00:11:04,139
which influence the development
and extent of floods,

241
00:11:04,339 --> 00:11:06,049
as we have said before.

242
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,977
On the basis of the data available

243
00:11:08,177 --> 00:11:09,262
in the case  of this study,

244
00:11:09,462 --> 00:11:11,473
the most relevant hazards defined

245
00:11:11,673 --> 00:11:14,467
are the exposure to the
Niger river overflowing

246
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,804
and the exposure to run off water

247
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:18,289
accumulation

248
00:11:18,489 --> 00:11:20,034
following torrential rain.

249
00:11:20,576 --> 00:11:23,542
Thus the hazard to the direct
overflow of the river

250
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:25,223
is determined

251
00:11:25,423 --> 00:11:27,772
from the analysis of
a series of historical data:

252
00:11:27,972 --> 00:11:29,637
the flow of the Niger in Niamey

253
00:11:29,837 --> 00:11:33,217
allowing to define the
once-a-century flood,

254
00:11:33,417 --> 00:11:36,421
that is to say a flood that comes back
on average every 100 years.

255
00:11:36,929 --> 00:11:38,608
The centennial flood is often used

256
00:11:38,808 --> 00:11:40,083
as a reference event

257
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:42,618
for the implementation of flood

258
00:11:42,818 --> 00:11:43,959
risk prevention plans.

259
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:46,125
The radius of influence of such a flood

260
00:11:46,325 --> 00:11:48,319
contributes in determining the exposure

261
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,845
to the Niger overflow.

262
00:11:50,363 --> 00:11:51,240
In this study,

263
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,419
it is a radius of 400 meters
that is defined.

264
00:11:53,619 --> 00:11:55,608
The linear distance of each unit

265
00:11:55,808 --> 00:11:57,718
in relation to the river bed

266
00:11:57,918 --> 00:11:59,807
determines its exposure level

267
00:12:00,007 --> 00:12:02,433
and is presented by a buffer zone

268
00:12:02,633 --> 00:12:03,950
on both sides of the river.

269
00:12:04,487 --> 00:12:06,852
The closer the entity is to
the course of the river,

270
00:12:07,052 --> 00:12:09,417
the greater its exposure to overflow.

271
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:13,281
Regarding the water accumulation hazard,

272
00:12:13,481 --> 00:12:15,402
the most representative variable here

273
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,814
is the topographic index or
the Beven index.

274
00:12:18,014 --> 00:12:20,052
It is calculated from the MNT

275
00:12:20,252 --> 00:12:22,466
obtained from the data ASTER DEM.

276
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:23,998
This is the natural logarithm

277
00:12:24,198 --> 00:12:25,796
of year surface ratio

278
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:27,812
to a point given on the slope.

279
00:12:28,012 --> 00:12:30,480
This index provides information
on the spatial

280
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,110
distribution of the accumulation
level of the run off waters

281
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,317
of each entity.

282
00:12:34,731 --> 00:12:37,338
The other factors are
considered to be constant

283
00:12:37,538 --> 00:12:39,716
and have no remarkable effect

284
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,516
on the flooding phenomenon

285
00:12:41,716 --> 00:12:44,107
and will not be taken into
account in this study

286
00:12:45,642 --> 00:12:47,554
Once the two maps,

287
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:51,319
that is to say the overflow hazard
and the accumulation hazard,

288
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,109
are determined

289
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:56,104
we will construct the flood plain map.

290
00:12:56,304 --> 00:12:57,129
For that,

291
00:12:57,329 --> 00:13:00,116
depending on whether
the flooding is low, medium or high,

292
00:13:00,688 --> 00:13:03,844
we will reclassify the images

293
00:13:04,044 --> 00:13:06,019
on the basis of three criteria,

294
00:13:06,601 --> 00:13:07,848
and these three criteria

295
00:13:08,048 --> 00:13:10,121
are in particular on factors

296
00:13:10,321 --> 00:13:12,122
aggravating the flooding,

297
00:13:12,322 --> 00:13:15,362
taking into account the topographical,

298
00:13:15,562 --> 00:13:18,125
hydrological and hydrogeological elements.

299
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:22,083
The combination of these two hazard maps

300
00:13:22,283 --> 00:13:23,611
allows to determine

301
00:13:23,811 --> 00:13:27,606
the flood plain map in
the city of Niamey.

302
00:13:29,396 --> 00:13:31,096
One of the most important elements

303
00:13:31,296 --> 00:13:33,014
is the stake map.

304
00:13:33,569 --> 00:13:35,543
This map was made

305
00:13:35,743 --> 00:13:37,623
by mapping

306
00:13:37,823 --> 00:13:39,551
the dynamics of land use

307
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:43,766
between 1998 and 2013

308
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:47,035
using the Landsat TM images
of 1998

309
00:13:47,235 --> 00:13:49,091
and the Landsat OLI images of 2013.

310
00:13:49,291 --> 00:13:50,679
The objective here

311
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:54,086
is to show that buildings
have evolved over the years,

312
00:13:54,286 --> 00:13:57,230
which is therefore of a particular
interest for this study

313
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,412
where populations have become vulnerable

314
00:13:59,612 --> 00:14:00,956
due to the urban growth.

315
00:14:01,812 --> 00:14:03,775
The supervised classification
of the images,

316
00:14:03,975 --> 00:14:06,662
followed by a validation
by field missions,

317
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:11,236
allowed to establish
a dynamics of land use.

318
00:14:11,825 --> 00:14:12,550
Then,

319
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:15,155
we will digitize the buildings

320
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:18,265
to produce the map of the buildings.

321
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:19,655
This map

322
00:14:19,855 --> 00:14:22,829
superimposed on the numerical
model of altitude

323
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,847
shows that part of the city

324
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:29,211
is on the bed of the river Niger,

325
00:14:29,991 --> 00:14:31,558
and the stakes,

326
00:14:32,444 --> 00:14:35,373
concern the economic,

327
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:36,789
socio-economic activities

328
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:40,701
and how are we going to characterize
these activities

329
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:42,938
to determine the stake map?

330
00:14:43,504 --> 00:14:44,450
Here,

331
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,490
we have not retained
a specific criterion

332
00:14:48,112 --> 00:14:50,101
regarding the administrative buildings,

333
00:14:50,301 --> 00:14:52,701
the public and private companies,

334
00:14:52,901 --> 00:14:54,087
and the houses.

335
00:14:54,287 --> 00:14:58,057
We considered them to be of the
same level of vulnerability.

336
00:14:58,257 --> 00:15:00,589
Thus the vulnerability of the building

337
00:15:00,789 --> 00:15:03,070
is considered as unique

338
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:09,678
and can allow to map the stakes that

339
00:15:09,878 --> 00:15:12,555
we will couple with the hazards later

340
00:15:12,755 --> 00:15:15,972
to help us make decisions

341
00:15:16,172 --> 00:15:18,539
for the development of the territory.

342
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,665
The map established

343
00:15:20,865 --> 00:15:23,352
from a combination of different factors,

344
00:15:23,552 --> 00:15:27,164
the hazard and the vulnerability
of the stakes,

345
00:15:27,364 --> 00:15:29,277
is an important element

346
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:31,526
which allows to make a decision.

347
00:15:31,726 --> 00:15:34,926
And it is the object of this study

348
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:38,407
that allows you to know
that spatial analysis

349
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:41,351
can help identifying areas

350
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:43,924
that can be developed,

351
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:48,140
areas that can be protected
against floodings.

352
00:15:48,615 --> 00:15:50,878
And it is the interest of this work

353
00:15:51,078 --> 00:15:53,797
that allows the decision-makers

354
00:15:53,997 --> 00:15:55,562
of the city of Niamey

355
00:15:55,762 --> 00:15:59,006
to be able to guide the
development activities

356
00:15:59,206 --> 00:16:01,244
and the future plots

357
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:03,381
for the spreading of the city

358
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:08,028
which continues its growth on
the two banks of the Niger river.

359
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:21,916
The analysis of land use maps

360
00:16:22,116 --> 00:16:24,883
shows a growth in built-up areas

361
00:16:25,083 --> 00:16:28,082
between 1998 and 2013,

362
00:16:28,659 --> 00:16:29,562
a growth

363
00:16:29,762 --> 00:16:32,879
that is more pronounced on the left
bank of the Niger river.

364
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:36,564
We observe that the zones situated
on the very edge of the river

365
00:16:36,764 --> 00:16:39,975
concentrate a variety of
economic activities

366
00:16:40,175 --> 00:16:42,948
and certain strategic infrastructures.

367
00:16:43,918 --> 00:16:46,246
One of the most important results

368
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:47,346
in this study

369
00:16:47,546 --> 00:16:49,426
is the flood risk map.

370
00:16:50,116 --> 00:16:53,076
In view of the topography,
the hydrography,

371
00:16:53,276 --> 00:16:55,305
the climate and the regime
of the Niger river,

372
00:16:55,505 --> 00:16:56,840
the city of Niamey

373
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,955
presents obvious risks of flooding

374
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:02,173
if we look and analyse this map.

375
00:17:02,373 --> 00:17:03,177
On the right bank,

376
00:17:03,377 --> 00:17:08,425
the districts of Lamordé and Nogaré
are the most vulnerable

377
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:11,441
and, to a lesser extent, those of
Karadjé and the university.

378
00:17:11,641 --> 00:17:12,511
On the left bank,

379
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:16,557
the districts of Goubel and Saga
would be the most exposed.

380
00:17:17,089 --> 00:17:18,446
At the infrastructure level,

381
00:17:18,646 --> 00:17:19,835
on the right bank,

382
00:17:20,035 --> 00:17:25,613
the AGRHYMET, the CHU,
the INS and even the MIG

383
00:17:25,813 --> 00:17:28,025
are in flood plains.

384
00:17:29,361 --> 00:17:30,838
What steps should be taken?

385
00:17:32,469 --> 00:17:35,463
This map is an example of a decision case.

386
00:17:36,429 --> 00:17:38,643
It was established in a very simple way,

387
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:42,970
but it has the advantage of situating
the flood plains of Niamey.

388
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,984
It can serve as a basis

389
00:17:45,209 --> 00:17:47,243
for future plot allocations

390
00:17:47,443 --> 00:17:49,076
in the riverside areas of the river

391
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,585
whilst avoiding hazardous areas.

392
00:17:52,835 --> 00:17:54,396
The climate disruption

393
00:17:54,596 --> 00:17:55,805
being a natural phenomenon,

394
00:17:56,005 --> 00:17:56,951
the preventive action

395
00:17:57,151 --> 00:17:58,618
through flood modeling

396
00:17:58,818 --> 00:18:00,994
and the setting up of an alert system

397
00:18:01,194 --> 00:18:04,623
seems to be a solution to the
flooding problem in Niamey.

398
00:18:15,003 --> 00:18:16,146
What can we learn

399
00:18:16,830 --> 00:18:18,020
from this case study?

400
00:18:18,964 --> 00:18:22,153
We were able to use a GIS

401
00:18:22,353 --> 00:18:24,876
for the mapping of flood plains

402
00:18:25,076 --> 00:18:28,072
in the city of Niamey, in Niger.

403
00:18:29,414 --> 00:18:31,224
We have also observed that

404
00:18:31,424 --> 00:18:33,534
there has been strong
growth along the river

405
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:35,210
in recent years.

406
00:18:35,410 --> 00:18:38,037
This has accentuated the territorial

407
00:18:38,237 --> 00:18:39,703
and population vulnerability.

408
00:18:41,476 --> 00:18:44,659
This document can be made
available to decision-makers

409
00:18:44,859 --> 00:18:46,245
and this simple map

410
00:18:46,445 --> 00:18:48,295
presents sites vulnerable to flooding

411
00:18:48,841 --> 00:18:50,977
in order to take preventive measures

412
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:52,747
to fight against the floods

413
00:18:52,947 --> 00:18:55,811
which constitute a natural disaster

414
00:18:56,011 --> 00:18:58,371
affecting all the countries
of the world,

415
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,334
even Niger, which is a
sahelian country,

416
00:19:01,534 --> 00:19:03,114
is affected by the floods

417
00:19:03,753 --> 00:19:07,945
near the major bed of the Niger river

418
00:19:08,145 --> 00:19:11,586
and because of
uncontrolled urbanization

419
00:19:11,786 --> 00:19:13,008
in these areas.

420
00:19:14,272 --> 00:19:17,495
I thank you for following this lesson

421
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,366
and I look forward to seeing you

422
00:19:19,566 --> 00:19:20,670
in the next lesson.

423
00:19:21,249 --> 00:19:22,337
Goodbye.
