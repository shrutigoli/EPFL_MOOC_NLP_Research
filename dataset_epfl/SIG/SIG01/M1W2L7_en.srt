1
00:00:22,692 --> 00:00:25,821
In this case study, we will present

2
00:00:26,447 --> 00:00:31,448
a study of urban transports
and urban planning

3
00:00:31,863 --> 00:00:33,250
on the city ​​of Touba.

4
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:37,485
It is a study that focuses 
on the questions

5
00:00:37,686 --> 00:00:40,748
of transportation management 
and mobility.

6
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:48,780
With as a filigree, all the thinking
on the urban development,

7
00:00:49,074 --> 00:00:52,087
the development of the city ,
the urban management,

8
00:00:53,096 --> 00:00:58,335
so a study that involves a 
large part of questions on

9
00:00:58,530 --> 00:00:59,984
transport and mobility

10
00:01:00,168 --> 00:01:03,005
a part more ... 
less visible perhaps

11
00:01:03,351 --> 00:01:05,879
of urban planning and development

12
00:01:06,393 --> 00:01:10,105
and a study that included a GIS section

13
00:01:10,316 --> 00:01:13,567
that we are especially interested in.

14
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,399
We will first briefly discuss 
the town of Touba

15
00:01:17,803 --> 00:01:22,917
then we will present this study of urban
transport and urban planning

16
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:24,769
that we will not see in detail,

17
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:28,624
we will focus on the main results
of the study,

18
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:30,478
which we will review a little

19
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:35,483
before focusing more
specifically on the GIS module.

20
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:44,016
Touba is in Senegal

21
00:01:44,383 --> 00:01:46,275
not far from Thies,

22
00:01:47,014 --> 00:01:50,674
about 400 km East of Dakar.

23
00:01:51,577 --> 00:01:56,220
We can see already
on this satellite photo taken from Google

24
00:01:57,209 --> 00:02:02,628
the city of M'Backé which is 
neighboring the agglomeration of Touba

25
00:02:02,894 --> 00:02:03,881
and in the city of Touba,

26
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:07,080
we can easily identify
the great mosque in the center

27
00:02:07,262 --> 00:02:11,627
and the ring road,
the great bypass

28
00:02:11,804 --> 00:02:16,029
which surrounds the city and 
which we will see a few times

29
00:02:16,205 --> 00:02:19,556
in all the documents of this study.

30
00:02:20,873 --> 00:02:25,574
Touba is a spiritual city,
capital of the Mouride brotherhood,

31
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:31,127
a holy city founded in 1887
by Sheikh Ahmadou Bamba,

32
00:02:31,642 --> 00:02:36,086
with a population that was
reaching 25,000 inhabitants,

33
00:02:36,503 --> 00:02:38,928
thirty years ago

34
00:02:39,591 --> 00:02:42,896
and now reaching more than
500,000 inhabitants

35
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:46,473
so an extremely rapid growth.

36
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:51,247
Touba is a city devoted
to spirituality

37
00:02:51,416 --> 00:02:55,352
with the great mosque which
was completed in 1963

38
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:58,588
and more than 500 secondary mosques

39
00:02:58,792 --> 00:03:00,917
in different parts of the city.

40
00:03:01,117 --> 00:03:05,042
Amongst the major events
that punctuate life in Touba,

41
00:03:05,216 --> 00:03:07,283
the great pilgrimage, the Great Magal

42
00:03:07,464 --> 00:03:10,372
with other smaller pilgrimages,

43
00:03:10,715 --> 00:03:12,102
but the great Magal, which drains

44
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,436
several million people in a few days.

45
00:03:15,898 --> 00:03:20,232
Touba is also a city that 
is not a city

46
00:03:20,895 --> 00:03:25,510
since the 33,000 ha occupied by the city,

47
00:03:25,703 --> 00:03:27,926
constitute in fact a private land title

48
00:03:28,838 --> 00:03:32,988
so that the agglomeration of Touba,
since it cannot be called a "city",

49
00:03:33,257 --> 00:03:35,385
doesn't have the official status of city,

50
00:03:35,566 --> 00:03:37,328
it doesn't have

51
00:03:37,501 --> 00:03:40,957
the administrative
structures of a city

52
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,152
that would be technical services, 
urban planning services,

53
00:03:44,536 --> 00:03:49,674
the deconcentrated (INAUDIBLE)
of central ministries etc. etc.

54
00:03:49,921 --> 00:03:53,911
The city management is
therefore done more empirically,

55
00:03:54,259 --> 00:03:57,642
which does not prevent things
from working relatively well.

56
00:03:58,242 --> 00:04:00,354
Nevertheless, the needs

57
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:03,884
of general planning are
important,

58
00:04:04,929 --> 00:04:08,534
if only to try to control
the urban development

59
00:04:08,717 --> 00:04:10,845
which is done at an accelerated pace

60
00:04:11,102 --> 00:04:14,852
with the management of plots,

61
00:04:15,229 --> 00:04:18,172
the management of drinking water 
and sanitization,

62
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,777
the question of waste,
the question of distribution,

63
00:04:21,953 --> 00:04:24,685
the connection to electricity and so on.

64
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:29,527
Added to this is the whole
dimension of mobility and transports

65
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:34,640
with different types
of transport, road networks

66
00:04:34,831 --> 00:04:38,290
and especially the transport management
during the Grand Magal period,

67
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,820
which sees an influx of large crowds.

68
00:04:50,802 --> 00:04:53,199
The study of urban transport
and urban planning

69
00:04:53,363 --> 00:04:55,879
which we will talk about in this
presentation

70
00:04:56,054 --> 00:04:58,737
was entrusted by
the Autonomous Agency of Roadworks

71
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:01,725
of the Republic of Senegal,
an office consortium

72
00:05:01,907 --> 00:05:06,907
formed by TRANSITEC, an office 
specialized in transport and mobility,

73
00:05:07,193 --> 00:05:11,542
URBAPLAN, an office specialized
in urban planning,

74
00:05:11,707 --> 00:05:16,124
IPOGEE which dealt with the geographical
information system section

75
00:05:16,310 --> 00:05:22,850
and MUNICIPALITY SERVICE
which has an architect office in Dakar

76
00:05:23,013 --> 00:05:28,303
and which coordinated the project
onsite in particular.

77
00:05:28,748 --> 00:05:30,723
The objective of the project consisted of

78
00:05:30,905 --> 00:05:33,942
first establishing a diagnostic
of the current situation,

79
00:05:34,119 --> 00:05:37,569
in terms of urban transport 
and urban development,

80
00:05:37,737 --> 00:05:41,815
defining the overall framework
in which to develop urbanization

81
00:05:41,989 --> 00:05:45,651
and transport networks
in the future and in this spirit

82
00:05:45,814 --> 00:05:48,345
establishing a traffic plan in a
short medium term

83
00:05:48,525 --> 00:05:52,710
with a horizon of 3-4 years 
in 2012

84
00:05:53,366 --> 00:05:57,672
and the means, the measures to
implement it

85
00:05:57,989 --> 00:06:01,077
and then defining a more
global development strategy

86
00:06:01,246 --> 00:06:03,198
in the long term in 2020

87
00:06:03,373 --> 00:06:08,573
with, in the 2 types of scenarios
we can envisage,

88
00:06:09,081 --> 00:06:11,930
first a densification
of the existing urban space

89
00:06:12,118 --> 00:06:14,482
or possibly as an alternative

90
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:16,888
the development of new poles of
activities.

91
00:06:17,112 --> 00:06:21,487
It must be said that today
everything is centered on the mosque

92
00:06:21,667 --> 00:06:23,689
which is the pivot of the whole system,

93
00:06:24,874 --> 00:06:28,867
with a number of disadvantages 
particularly in terms of mobility

94
00:06:29,118 --> 00:06:30,717
linked to this situation.

95
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:33,621
The study was programmed in 4 phases

96
00:06:33,794 --> 00:06:37,961
a first phase of diagnostic
analysis of the current situation,

97
00:06:38,161 --> 00:06:39,813
the identification constraints

98
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:44,181
and possibly redefining the objectives

99
00:06:44,378 --> 00:06:46,538
depending on the results of this analysis.

100
00:06:47,061 --> 00:06:52,187
In a second phase,
the objective was to develop a global

101
00:06:52,382 --> 00:06:56,273
and multimodal concept in terms of 
mobility and urban development

102
00:06:57,103 --> 00:06:58,965
In a third phase

103
00:06:59,797 --> 00:07:03,074
we wish to get some proposals
in termes of urban planning

104
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,107
with the elaboration of 
a transport plan

105
00:07:06,564 --> 00:07:09,164
and then all of this accompanied 
by the start,

106
00:07:09,365 --> 00:07:12,017
the implementation of a geographic
information system,

107
00:07:12,771 --> 00:07:15,107
to accompany this whole process.

108
00:07:15,966 --> 00:07:17,715
And in a final phase,

109
00:07:18,085 --> 00:07:22,122
the objective was to propose
actions in the short term

110
00:07:22,446 --> 00:07:26,245
and then a more global programme
in the long term for 2020.

111
00:07:26,635 --> 00:07:27,935
The specific objectives,

112
00:07:28,104 --> 00:07:31,290
of the geographic information
system section of this study

113
00:07:31,808 --> 00:07:33,994
consisted first of ...

114
00:07:34,273 --> 00:07:37,848
facilitating the access to information

115
00:07:38,472 --> 00:07:41,134
of a wide range of users

116
00:07:41,307 --> 00:07:45,588
with, as a filigree, the ideas 
of a simple

117
00:07:45,846 --> 00:07:47,496
and low cost interface

118
00:07:47,678 --> 00:07:50,330
so a somewhat customized development.

119
00:07:51,418 --> 00:07:56,826
Second constraint, the idea
of being able to take the existing data

120
00:07:57,189 --> 00:08:00,776
and in particular, the more than
100,000 existing plots

121
00:08:01,165 --> 00:08:03,577
of the land cadastre.

122
00:08:04,157 --> 00:08:05,269
Third constraint,

123
00:08:05,489 --> 00:08:10,877
the need to be able to entrust
the feeding of the database,

124
00:08:11,043 --> 00:08:14,893
so the editing of data, to a large
number of users.

125
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:18,154
So the implementation of a
management system

126
00:08:18,335 --> 00:08:21,310
that allows to validate the entries
before incorporating them

127
00:08:21,835 --> 00:08:24,660
to a final database.

128
00:08:26,419 --> 00:08:29,918
Fourth constraint, to be able to have

129
00:08:30,123 --> 00:08:32,138
and to be able to calculate indicators

130
00:08:32,302 --> 00:08:36,902
which allow to follow or to guide
the urban management.

131
00:08:37,653 --> 00:08:40,540
And finally last constraint 
but not the least

132
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:44,093
the need to be able to integrate

133
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:48,301
all the results of the study 
in the GIS platform.

134
00:08:49,348 --> 00:08:52,781
It is clear that this series 
of constraints

135
00:08:53,106 --> 00:08:57,381
is quite similar to what 
we had in other cases

136
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:59,259
in Thies and in the Seychelles 
in particular,

137
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:03,391
with studies in completely different
registers.

138
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:15,588
So in this part,

139
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:18,921
we will review the main results
of this study

140
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:22,749
and start with the main elements

141
00:09:22,928 --> 00:09:26,753
emerging from the diagnosis in 
terms of urbanization

142
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:30,983
with the existence of a
​​relatively high density area

143
00:09:31,168 --> 00:09:33,930
inside the bypass around the mosque

144
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:36,272
with up to 140 inhabitants/ha

145
00:09:36,449 --> 00:09:40,124
and then a largely weaker 
density circle 

146
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:44,831
of around 70 inhabitants/ha
in the outskirts of the city.

147
00:09:45,449 --> 00:09:49,296
In the positive elements identified
in this diagnosis ...

148
00:09:50,193 --> 00:09:53,218
in particular in the spiritual influence

149
00:09:53,665 --> 00:09:57,203
which extends beyond
the national borders of Senegal

150
00:09:57,373 --> 00:09:59,248
with a moral authority

151
00:09:59,442 --> 00:10:03,342
which enables this city
that is not a city

152
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:06,413
to function quite well after all,

153
00:10:06,577 --> 00:10:08,890
an exceptional population growth

154
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:12,930
a respect of the plot plans

155
00:10:13,121 --> 00:10:15,795
and then finally quite a generous 

156
00:10:15,962 --> 00:10:18,938
traffic lane system with wide roads.

157
00:10:19,828 --> 00:10:22,024
The weaknesses that were picked up

158
00:10:22,462 --> 00:10:25,462
were demographic projections that are

159
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:27,733
not very defensible,

160
00:10:27,922 --> 00:10:30,802
very low demographic densities

161
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,780
that actually make the cost of extending

162
00:10:34,958 --> 00:10:37,233
electricity, drinking water, sanitization...

163
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:41,063
it considerably increases
the cost of extending these networks.

164
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:46,548
The reason for this low density
is in fact the need

165
00:10:46,726 --> 00:10:50,476
for the inhabitants of these large plots

166
00:10:50,663 --> 00:10:55,438
to actually welcome the families
during the great annual pilgrimages.

167
00:10:55,704 --> 00:10:58,741
Amongst the positive elements
concerning the traffic lanes,

168
00:10:58,911 --> 00:11:00,399
the city entrance which is well marked,

169
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,957
the main axes well structured,

170
00:11:03,137 --> 00:11:07,724
the existence of a bypass
that surrounds the whole city center

171
00:11:07,931 --> 00:11:11,289
situation that is quite rare in
any case in West Africa

172
00:11:11,749 --> 00:11:13,332
good secondary roads

173
00:11:13,538 --> 00:11:14,940
and then finally ... the ...

174
00:11:15,127 --> 00:11:18,127
generous spaces allotted to the roads.

175
00:11:19,568 --> 00:11:21,830
Amongst the most problematic elements

176
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:24,905
the question of the mix of
transport between pedestrians,

177
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:27,209
horse-drawn transports, heavy vehicles,

178
00:11:28,264 --> 00:11:31,501
a certain disorganization

179
00:11:31,701 --> 00:11:35,602
in public transports and bus stations,

180
00:11:35,784 --> 00:11:40,259
the presence of some heavy vehicles that
sometimes hamper the traffic

181
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:44,030
the existence of markets
that overflow the roadways,

182
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:47,928
sometimes even constructions
that encroach on the public space

183
00:11:48,915 --> 00:11:49,990
etc.

184
00:11:50,537 --> 00:11:53,099
The diagnostic phase showed

185
00:11:53,293 --> 00:11:55,493
that walking is

186
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:59,123
the most important part in
the transport mode,

187
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:02,300
with 50% of trips being done 
by foot.

188
00:12:02,501 --> 00:12:05,101
A large part of 
horse-drawn carriages

189
00:12:05,288 --> 00:12:07,538
so carts pulled by horses

190
00:12:07,716 --> 00:12:11,203
and what is especially
striking, a very small share

191
00:12:11,361 --> 00:12:15,073
of individual motorized
transport in the order of 10%.

192
00:12:15,246 --> 00:12:19,246
The fact that these modes of
transport are mixed

193
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,897
includes a certain…

194
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:25,815
the fact that these different
modes of transport are mixed

195
00:12:26,193 --> 00:12:27,855
induces a number of conflicts,

196
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:29,898
in terms of speed, priorities,

197
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,323
capacities of the traffic lanes,

198
00:12:33,292 --> 00:12:36,392
concentration of the parking space, etc.

199
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:40,892
The shortcomings in terms
of development and urban management

200
00:12:41,087 --> 00:12:44,374
actually feed a vicious circle

201
00:12:44,543 --> 00:12:49,755
which is characterized by the
absence of efficient public transports

202
00:12:49,939 --> 00:12:52,739
by disturbances due to traffic

203
00:12:52,928 --> 00:12:55,841
by the devaluation of the 
green transport modes

204
00:12:56,015 --> 00:13:00,546
in any case the pedestrian
mode of transport, or even the bicycle

205
00:13:00,866 --> 00:13:04,266
with for... consequence ....

206
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,422
a strong development,
a strong urban sprawl

207
00:13:06,605 --> 00:13:10,417
a stronger use of
informal collective modes

208
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:14,305
which makes the accessibility
more difficult

209
00:13:14,488 --> 00:13:16,700
so a deterioration in
the quality of life

210
00:13:16,885 --> 00:13:18,621
which hinders the economic development

211
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:23,315
which prevents to go to a better 
controlled urban development,

212
00:13:23,591 --> 00:13:27,172
the suburbs are not so much
integrated, under-equipped

213
00:13:27,366 --> 00:13:29,706
particularly in terms of roads,
public transports,

214
00:13:30,006 --> 00:13:31,895
urban services, etc.

215
00:13:32,316 --> 00:13:33,817
On the contrary, a planning

216
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:36,257
of the urban development 
and the mobility

217
00:13:36,478 --> 00:13:38,823
would enable to start a virtuous cycle

218
00:13:39,312 --> 00:13:42,540
through a better organization 
of public transports,

219
00:13:43,152 --> 00:13:47,744
the building of hierarchical
traffic lanes network

220
00:13:47,992 --> 00:13:52,007
and a better road sharing
between the different modes of transport

221
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,543
all of which aim at controlling
the urban development,

222
00:13:56,772 --> 00:13:59,530
controlling the growth
and the mobility of traffic

223
00:13:59,725 --> 00:14:02,618
an improvement of the 
accessibility of living conditions,

224
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:04,923
a better control of ...

225
00:14:05,402 --> 00:14:09,005
the location of activities and equipments

226
00:14:10,501 --> 00:14:14,538
and all of this feeding a virtuous circle.

227
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:18,615
At the end of this diagnostic phase,

228
00:14:18,877 --> 00:14:23,640
the objectives of the study 
were reaffirmed

229
00:14:23,852 --> 00:14:27,585
as we can see here on the 
10 elements mentioned

230
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:30,085
quite a strong emphasis

231
00:14:30,598 --> 00:14:33,698
put on the dimension of mobility
and transport

232
00:14:34,489 --> 00:14:38,306
as an element susceptible to promote a ...

233
00:14:38,849 --> 00:14:40,787
a more harmonious urban development.

234
00:14:40,956 --> 00:14:43,030
The general concept proposed 
for the rest

235
00:14:43,211 --> 00:14:45,575
of the planning reflection

236
00:14:45,817 --> 00:14:49,816
is based on the idea of ​​switching
from a radial system

237
00:14:50,123 --> 00:14:53,123
with mixed transport modes

238
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:57,158
to a diagonal system on which

239
00:14:57,433 --> 00:14:59,557
motorized public transports 
would be concentrated,

240
00:14:59,859 --> 00:15:03,371
combined with a feeder system
for the horse-drawn carriages

241
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,037
which would lead to serve the districts

242
00:15:07,536 --> 00:15:10,991
in the direction of
the main public transport routes.

243
00:15:11,595 --> 00:15:15,642
Subsequently the planning
and development reflexion

244
00:15:16,070 --> 00:15:19,573
led to propose a transport plan

245
00:15:20,763 --> 00:15:23,938
by 2012 here for the city center

246
00:15:24,158 --> 00:15:27,469
with a first inner boulevard

247
00:15:27,702 --> 00:15:30,914
which is actually destined
to preserve

248
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:34,490
the tranquility of the large mosque area

249
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:38,081
by banning the circulation
of this hypercenter,

250
00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:40,346
an inner boulevard that 
would be doubled

251
00:15:40,518 --> 00:15:43,972
by a second boulevard more ... more ...

252
00:15:44,305 --> 00:15:46,216
at a slightly greater distance

253
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:48,699
beyond the Ocass market area

254
00:15:49,002 --> 00:15:51,613
which would also serve ...

255
00:15:52,113 --> 00:15:55,113
as a mean of diverting the traffic

256
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:58,049
of the hypercenter and the mosque area.

257
00:15:58,642 --> 00:16:02,405
On a larger scale we see that
the transport planning

258
00:16:02,624 --> 00:16:06,004
plans a succession of bypasses

259
00:16:06,556 --> 00:16:10,262
that surround the hypercentre

260
00:16:10,673 --> 00:16:12,882
at increasingly greater distances

261
00:16:13,503 --> 00:16:17,228
all of it combined with a collective
transport system

262
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:22,698
which includes a series
of lines that allows crossing the city

263
00:16:23,158 --> 00:16:25,360
along diagonals.

264
00:16:25,593 --> 00:16:26,804
To these elements of reflection

265
00:16:26,996 --> 00:16:29,134
on the organization of
transports in general

266
00:16:29,302 --> 00:16:31,590
and of...especially public transports ...

267
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:35,779
a series of recommendations

268
00:16:36,055 --> 00:16:37,916
defining access principles

269
00:16:38,103 --> 00:16:40,058
to the city of Touba during
the period of the Great Magal

270
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:41,870
by 2012 is added

271
00:16:42,261 --> 00:16:44,636
with an enlarged
pedestrian zone in the city center

272
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:48,156
and then parking areas

273
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:53,774
to stop the traffic before
the big central congestion.

274
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:57,231
This board shows the evolution

275
00:16:58,165 --> 00:17:00,935
imagined for the horse-drawn world

276
00:17:01,424 --> 00:17:05,882
with the horse-dawn collection 
in the districts

277
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,900
and the servicing of
public transport stops

278
00:17:11,105 --> 00:17:14,089
along the main roads, 
in the diagonals,

279
00:17:14,512 --> 00:17:16,899
both at the scale

280
00:17:17,236 --> 00:17:20,287
in 2012 in dark green

281
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:23,184
and in the longer term in 2020,

282
00:17:23,426 --> 00:17:26,791
these are the feeder 
zone points in white.

283
00:17:27,025 --> 00:17:28,500
By 2020, 

284
00:17:28,694 --> 00:17:32,590
the the traffic lanes plan
plans a series of bypasses

285
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:36,772
at an increasingly greater distance
of the hypercenter

286
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:40,040
with in the particular case

287
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:42,571
the development of new zones 
of activities

288
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:46,882
to the West of the city and
near the town of M'Backé.

289
00:17:47,496 --> 00:17:49,598
Still by 2020

290
00:17:49,798 --> 00:17:53,768
an extension of the implantation
of the public transport network

291
00:17:54,185 --> 00:17:58,332
with the appearance in particular
of a permanent line

292
00:17:58,531 --> 00:18:00,537
on the first bypass

293
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,720
so on the current ring road.

294
00:18:04,266 --> 00:18:07,266
And finally a broader vision

295
00:18:07,457 --> 00:18:11,117
for the public influx management

296
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:14,422
during the period of the Great Magal.

297
00:18:15,026 --> 00:18:20,032
These different network,
public transports plans, etc.

298
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,890
are accompanied by a number of measures

299
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:25,258
proposed in a short medium term

300
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,804
to promote the urban development

301
00:18:28,988 --> 00:18:31,062
and the development of mobility in Touba.

302
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,532
So a list of elements related to
town planning,

303
00:18:34,715 --> 00:18:37,419
infrastructures, public transports

304
00:18:38,219 --> 00:18:41,370
and parking aspects for the transport
of goods,

305
00:18:41,548 --> 00:18:43,555
institutional aspects and implementation

306
00:18:43,735 --> 00:18:45,776
and to the aspects of communication.

307
00:18:46,236 --> 00:18:49,466
One of the interests
of the proposed solution

308
00:18:49,657 --> 00:18:52,775
is to allow a gradual development

309
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,979
depending on the actual
evolution of the city of Touba.

310
00:18:57,168 --> 00:18:59,785
The various concentric rings can ...

311
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:02,983
indeed be realized progressively

312
00:19:03,437 --> 00:19:06,674
so that the proposed development plan

313
00:19:07,012 --> 00:19:11,341
is spread out and adaptable
which in itself is a good thing.

314
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:23,373
The particularity of the GIS model

315
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:25,795
which was developed for this study

316
00:19:26,002 --> 00:19:30,817
is to constitute a standalone
solution

317
00:19:31,366 --> 00:19:33,914
which has been programmed in C Sharp

318
00:19:34,091 --> 00:19:38,314
with the TatukGIS component for 
the cartographic part

319
00:19:38,714 --> 00:19:42,247
and then the support of a MySQL database.

320
00:19:43,012 --> 00:19:44,912
Then in the data viewing mode,

321
00:19:45,085 --> 00:19:49,135
we can already simply
display the different layers:

322
00:19:49,314 --> 00:19:52,064
here the land title, the districts
of the city,

323
00:19:52,262 --> 00:19:55,198
we have removed the map background
and the Google image,

324
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,844
the national road network

325
00:19:57,044 --> 00:19:59,300
and the different types

326
00:20:00,419 --> 00:20:02,482
of objects, of existing 
equipment infrastructures

327
00:20:02,669 --> 00:20:05,652
in this case the aspects of
education

328
00:20:06,268 --> 00:20:07,708
hydraulics, farms.

329
00:20:08,094 --> 00:20:12,700
The consultation of the attributes
of these objects: here a section of road

330
00:20:13,893 --> 00:20:17,418
or a well or a borehole,

331
00:20:19,289 --> 00:20:20,668
here is a well,

332
00:20:21,384 --> 00:20:25,522
these different windows being able 
to be stacked on top 

333
00:20:26,097 --> 00:20:30,106
of each other on the edge of
the application.

334
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:35,003
Each layer can of course be configured

335
00:20:35,426 --> 00:20:38,426
with color, symbol size,

336
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:43,943
type of symbol, transparency, etc. etc.

337
00:20:47,207 --> 00:20:50,069
At the level of thematic indicators

338
00:20:50,267 --> 00:20:53,037
we add here the layer of districts,

339
00:20:53,353 --> 00:20:55,518
the access to these indicators

340
00:20:55,691 --> 00:20:59,313
first the access to labels that allow to ...

341
00:21:00,848 --> 00:21:03,313
to add the names of neighborhoods

342
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:08,653
and through the same intermediary with ...

343
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,753
with the shift key the indicators

344
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:14,879
where we can actually select
the various attributes

345
00:21:15,095 --> 00:21:19,803
to build a map, so here simply
a map that gives ...

346
00:21:21,175 --> 00:21:25,330
the hierarchy of the districts
according to their sizes.

347
00:21:26,053 --> 00:21:29,316
There is more information 
in a smaller scale

348
00:21:29,487 --> 00:21:31,428
which is that of the districts which
corresponds in fact

349
00:21:31,628 --> 00:21:33,461
to the census districts

350
00:21:33,984 --> 00:21:37,034
for which we have a great 
wealth of attributes

351
00:21:37,215 --> 00:21:38,883
which are all the attributes

352
00:21:39,069 --> 00:21:41,246
which come from the
official census

353
00:21:41,556 --> 00:21:44,453
so here a map of the population density

354
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:47,802
and then we see that in all
of these indicators,

355
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:51,058
here we are in the "indicators"
module, we see that we have...

356
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:53,450
we find all these indicators

357
00:21:53,994 --> 00:21:56,160
first built on data

358
00:21:56,345 --> 00:21:59,082
and here represented by themes

359
00:21:59,268 --> 00:22:02,108
so education, health,
poverty, demography,

360
00:22:02,544 --> 00:22:05,134
drinking water, sanitization, housing

361
00:22:05,312 --> 00:22:06,984
with here particularly

362
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:11,057
as an example the map of the
proportion of ...

363
00:22:11,252 --> 00:22:14,011
residential buildings that have a ....

364
00:22:14,677 --> 00:22:15,941
a cement floor.

365
00:22:16,318 --> 00:22:18,610
These thematic maps can be

366
00:22:19,438 --> 00:22:22,264
configured by modifying
the number of classes,

367
00:22:22,705 --> 00:22:25,825
by changing the intervals used

368
00:22:26,017 --> 00:22:28,801
so the precision level
of the intervals,

369
00:22:29,259 --> 00:22:31,998
by changing the color scales

370
00:22:33,008 --> 00:22:35,527
or symbol size scales

371
00:22:36,590 --> 00:22:40,450
and always the transparency of layers.

372
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:47,152
The editing of data, so a 3rd module

373
00:22:47,528 --> 00:22:51,870
where we illustrate the four functions,

374
00:22:52,164 --> 00:22:54,191
the 3 adding, modifying

375
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:56,076
and objects deleting functions

376
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:59,606
in the imaginary case

377
00:22:59,769 --> 00:23:02,084
where we would like to add a new district

378
00:22:59,931 --> 00:23:01,989


379
00:23:02,359 --> 00:23:05,197
with the snap function that is activated

380
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:06,842
which allows to ...

381
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:11,243
draw jointing polygons.

382
00:23:12,112 --> 00:23:14,831
The saving, as we are in administrator mode,

383
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,954
is done directly here in the database.

384
00:23:18,987 --> 00:23:20,034
So we...

385
00:23:20,661 --> 00:23:23,431
add a second object here

386
00:23:24,132 --> 00:23:27,756
which we correct to be perfectly 
in the right place

387
00:23:29,684 --> 00:23:30,712
etc.

388
00:23:31,408 --> 00:23:34,722
We see that we can also change an object,

389
00:23:40,497 --> 00:23:42,746
modify its attributes,

390
00:23:46,376 --> 00:23:48,228
or delete an object.

391
00:24:00,219 --> 00:24:02,568
The same thing but now in mode ...

392
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,718
lambda user mode,

393
00:24:07,551 --> 00:24:09,905
where we also add an object

394
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:15,511
with the particularity of ...

395
00:24:16,257 --> 00:24:19,219
saving this new object in 
"temporary" mode.

396
00:24:22,366 --> 00:24:24,881
Similarly for the second one,

397
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:32,001
we activate the layer of 
the changed objects to ...

398
00:24:32,409 --> 00:24:34,442
make a jointing polygon

399
00:24:35,102 --> 00:24:37,684
and we see that we have a
toolbar that allows ...

400
00:24:38,874 --> 00:24:43,117
to manage the display of the
proposed changes.

401
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,905
Here we modify an existing object

402
00:24:52,537 --> 00:24:55,361
and we see that if we activate
the corresponding button,

403
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:59,480
we display the proposed modification
of the existing object.

404
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:02,432
Same for a deletion,

405
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,646
so we save a deletion proposal

406
00:25:06,858 --> 00:25:11,268
that we can activate displayed in red.

407
00:25:13,322 --> 00:25:16,066
The deletion on the 
modification proposal

408
00:25:16,243 --> 00:25:18,255
is done directly

409
00:25:23,665 --> 00:25:27,844
as well as a modification proposal 
of an existing object.

410
00:25:39,506 --> 00:25:41,396
The landed cadastre

411
00:25:42,238 --> 00:25:48,379
can be consulted with simple user rights

412
00:25:48,833 --> 00:25:51,928
the consultation is limited
to the geometry

413
00:25:52,167 --> 00:25:55,254
and the identifier of the plots

414
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:59,599
whereas if we go in edit mode

415
00:25:59,767 --> 00:26:01,108
in cadastre mode

416
00:26:01,305 --> 00:26:03,966
with the rights...to be in a 
cadastre mode it is necessary

417
00:26:04,141 --> 00:26:06,143
to have the administrator rights

418
00:26:06,368 --> 00:26:10,267
and at that moment when 
we select a plot

419
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:14,710
we have all the pieces
of information related to this plot

420
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:17,951
including the owner's characteristics,

421
00:26:18,140 --> 00:26:19,740
the use, etc.

422
00:26:19,922 --> 00:26:22,578
The consultation can be done 
either by plot

423
00:26:22,768 --> 00:26:25,611
or by owner so 2 inputs

424
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,395
with a data edition system

425
00:26:28,719 --> 00:26:31,708
comparable to standard data.

426
00:26:32,275 --> 00:26:36,305
The fact of being registered as a user

427
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:38,138
or as an administrator

428
00:26:38,998 --> 00:26:42,634
is decided when we connect 
to the database.

429
00:26:43,191 --> 00:26:45,554
In the case of the urban transport 
and urban planning study

430
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,866
there was production of a ...

431
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:50,863
it was not always very simple
to integrate these maps

432
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:53,099
in the geographic information system

433
00:26:53,309 --> 00:26:55,695
and especially to find one's way around

434
00:26:55,886 --> 00:26:59,335
in the many possible components.

435
00:27:00,621 --> 00:27:03,024
So the "transport study" module

436
00:27:03,214 --> 00:27:04,951
allows to manage the way

437
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,925
in which the various elements are grouped,

438
00:27:07,087 --> 00:27:09,241
by study phase, by
chapter of the reports

439
00:27:09,429 --> 00:27:11,966
by topic, by mode of transport,

440
00:27:12,495 --> 00:27:16,445
by document type, etc. 2012, 2020.

441
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,017
We can also

442
00:27:18,314 --> 00:27:19,260
group

443
00:27:19,443 --> 00:27:21,607
several keys ...

444
00:27:21,865 --> 00:27:24,260
of groups in order to have a

445
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:29,039
a sampling, a sorting, 
a prioritization by hand.

446
00:27:29,486 --> 00:27:32,536
The different elements usually
have two small icons,

447
00:27:32,703 --> 00:27:36,591
the first here to activate
the vectorial layer.

448
00:27:36,775 --> 00:27:40,443
We are here on the traffic load plan

449
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:42,924
so in vectorial mode

450
00:27:43,149 --> 00:27:45,824
and the small icon next to the button

451
00:27:46,011 --> 00:27:50,482
allows access to the PDF board
equivalent

452
00:27:50,686 --> 00:27:54,327
from the report of the study.

453
00:27:58,028 --> 00:28:00,939
In the case of the small colored icon

454
00:28:01,167 --> 00:28:04,630
we have access to ...
not to a vectorial version

455
00:28:05,694 --> 00:28:08,852
of a data layer but simply to ...

456
00:28:09,265 --> 00:28:10,875
actually to ...

457
00:28:11,307 --> 00:28:14,820
a raster image that has
the merit of being transparent

458
00:28:14,991 --> 00:28:17,191
and which can be superimposed

459
00:28:17,801 --> 00:28:21,163
to other elements of the geographic
information system.

460
00:28:21,396 --> 00:28:26,119
A second click and
the legend of this image appears

461
00:28:26,306 --> 00:28:29,747
and as previously the PDF 
icon provides access

462
00:28:29,928 --> 00:28:33,382
to the PDF page of the report concerned.

463
00:28:35,393 --> 00:28:38,418
If we take here the example
of the load plan

464
00:28:38,594 --> 00:28:40,646
and we go back

465
00:28:40,982 --> 00:28:44,007
to the side of the data display module,

466
00:28:44,192 --> 00:28:47,693
we see that in fact this layer
exists as a vectorial layer

467
00:28:47,924 --> 00:28:51,687
and in particular that
it can be activated and modified

468
00:28:51,873 --> 00:28:54,897
so it is possible to come and select

469
00:28:55,081 --> 00:28:56,735
an element of this load plan

470
00:28:56,915 --> 00:29:00,140
here this section which has 
5'000 vehicles days

471
00:29:00,336 --> 00:29:03,699
and come to change and 
update these values.

472
00:29:03,892 --> 00:29:05,748
So we can clearly see that the
interest of a ...

473
00:29:06,377 --> 00:29:08,050
of a vectorial system

474
00:29:08,485 --> 00:29:11,175
is to provide an update

475
00:29:11,969 --> 00:29:15,322
of the data, which is something 
that the "raster" mode doesn't allow.

476
00:29:17,914 --> 00:29:20,887
Finally, the icing on the cake,

477
00:29:21,558 --> 00:29:23,059
a temporal follow-up element

478
00:29:23,776 --> 00:29:27,194
has been incorporated,

479
00:29:27,537 --> 00:29:29,872
what can be illustrated in this example

480
00:29:30,368 --> 00:29:32,005
by a...

481
00:29:32,810 --> 00:29:34,182
a case in which ...

482
00:29:34,371 --> 00:29:37,846
we will add a new object,

483
00:29:38,028 --> 00:29:41,838
here we are on the district 
layer as before

484
00:29:42,035 --> 00:29:44,289
so we decide to create a ...

485
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:48,411
a mock object somewhere,

486
00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:51,014
this object...

487
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,865
we see that it is linked to a date

488
00:29:55,399 --> 00:29:57,938
and we can decide that the next day,

489
00:29:58,105 --> 00:30:00,592
we want to change this object

490
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:03,528
so we go into modification 
mode, we select it

491
00:30:03,997 --> 00:30:06,232
and then enlarge it,

492
00:30:08,364 --> 00:30:11,515
we can modify its attributes,

493
00:30:13,339 --> 00:30:17,462
Two days later we decide
to delete this object,

494
00:30:17,676 --> 00:30:19,803
so we go in "deletion" mode,

495
00:30:20,428 --> 00:30:22,107
we select the object,

496
00:30:23,609 --> 00:30:25,291
it disappears.

497
00:30:25,745 --> 00:30:29,095
We save the evolution of the management 

498
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:31,235
of this object in the database

499
00:30:31,425 --> 00:30:33,197
so each time we modify the object,

500
00:30:33,372 --> 00:30:35,795
one of its attributes, 
we create a new object

501
00:30:36,045 --> 00:30:38,470
and we keep track of these changes

502
00:30:38,654 --> 00:30:44,867
so the evolution of the database 
can be monitored over time.
