1
00:00:24,764 --> 00:00:28,751
Welcome to this course which will focus
on geographic coordinates

2
00:00:28,931 --> 00:00:30,724
and projection systems.

3
00:00:30,887 --> 00:00:32,101
Geographic coordinates

4 
00:00:32,265 --> 00:00:34,728
allow to locate objects
on the surface of the hearth.

5
00:00:35,343 --> 00:00:36,702
The projection systems

6
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:40,812
allow objects to be projected
onto a flat surface.

7
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:45,916
In the first lesson we discussed

8
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:48,065
the question of the modeling
of the territory

9
00:00:48,888 --> 00:00:50,495
and we have seen that this implies,

10
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:51,915
at least in object mode,

11
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:56,133
to identify and describe the elements
that make up the model.

12
00:00:57,211 --> 00:00:58,397
We will now see

13
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:01,317
how to describe the geometric 
of these elements

14
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:04,537
and how this geometric can be transposed

15
00:01:04,854 --> 00:01:07,132
into a cartographic representation.

16
00:01:08,528 --> 00:01:10,543
This second lesson will therefore

17
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:14,711
deal with the metric of the description
of the elements of the territory

18
00:01:15,237 --> 00:01:18,076
so on questions of scale,
of coordinate systems

19
00:01:18,252 --> 00:01:20,146
and projection systems.

20
00:01:21,107 --> 00:01:22,967
The objective of this lesson 
is to explain

21
00:01:23,154 --> 00:01:27,182
the principles of this
geographical space transposition

22
00:01:27,355 --> 00:01:29,675
to the cartographic representation.

23
00:01:30,014 --> 00:01:32,314
At the end of the lesson, 
you will be able to describe

24
00:01:32,498 --> 00:01:36,432
and use these notions of coordinates 
and projection scales.

25
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:39,540
In this lesson, we will
therefore discuss successively

26
00:01:40,191 --> 00:01:42,941
the notions of observation
and representation scales

27
00:01:44,268 --> 00:01:46,706
the notions of coordinates and positioning,

28
00:01:47,773 --> 00:01:49,673
the principles of projection systems

29
00:01:49,878 --> 00:01:51,791
and finally the EPSG codes.

30
00:02:01,813 --> 00:02:03,652
The scale of representation 
is the ratio

31
00:02:03,836 --> 00:02:07,951
between the distance measured on the map
or on the screen and the actual distance.

32
00:02:09,228 --> 00:02:11,203
So, for example, on the scale
of 10 thousandth

33
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:14,844
1 cm on the map
is 100 meters on the field,

34
00:02:15,373 --> 00:02:19,148
whereas at the scale of 50,000,
this centimeter represents 500 m

35
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:22,591
and on the scale of 100,000
it will represent 1,000 m.

36
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:26,113
The choice of the scale is dictated
by technical constraints,

37
00:02:27,006 --> 00:02:30,619
by graphical constraints or by
physiological constraints,

38
00:02:30,809 --> 00:02:33,218
what the human eye is
capable of perceiving.

39
00:02:33,942 --> 00:02:36,743
What objects to represent and
with what precision ?

40
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,169
Beyond the thematic aspects, these
two fundamental questions

41
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:43,415
of the modeling of the territory
refer to the questions

42
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:46,866
of the observation
and representation scales,

43
00:02:47,296 --> 00:02:50,246
in other words to the degree of
schematization of the real

44
00:02:50,435 --> 00:02:52,596
that the modeling of the 
territory implies.

45
00:02:52,887 --> 00:02:54,487
As we have already seen
in the first lesson

46
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:57,472
the degree of generalization
depends of the spatial resolution

47
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:58,764
of the observed phenomenon.

48
00:02:59,236 --> 00:03:01,348
For exemple, constructions are ideally

49
00:03:01,523 --> 00:03:03,592
represented by their hold on the ground

50
00:03:03,791 --> 00:03:06,291
but they can be also
represented by some dots

51
00:03:06,466 --> 00:03:08,966
which would be the gravity centres
of these polygons

52
00:03:09,253 --> 00:03:10,691
or by these arbitrary polygons

53
00:03:10,889 --> 00:03:13,239
which do not have much
signification on a large scale

54
00:03:13,402 --> 00:03:16,269
but which make sense 
on smaller scales.

55
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:20,151
In this other example, we can see
that the course of a stream

56
00:03:20,342 --> 00:03:23,317
can be described with great
precision on a large scale

57
00:03:23,808 --> 00:03:27,296
but on smaller scales, this
precision becomes superfluous

58
00:03:27,452 --> 00:03:30,165
and it is preferable to
simplify the geometric

59
00:03:30,369 --> 00:03:33,900
for a more accessible representation.

60
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,145
The degree of generalization also depends

61
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:38,614
on the richness in thematic 
details sought,

62
00:03:38,797 --> 00:03:41,085
like this example of the road network,

63
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,050
which essential components
are represented in priority

64
00:03:44,226 --> 00:03:46,313
but for which we see that 
on a larger scale

65
00:03:46,486 --> 00:03:48,279
there is a whole series of
more detailed elements

66
00:03:48,443 --> 00:03:50,475
that can be taken into consideration.

67
00:03:50,683 --> 00:03:53,851
In the end, the choice is dictated
by the purpose of the modeling.

68
00:03:54,224 --> 00:03:57,361
For example, if the customer is an agency

69
00:03:57,524 --> 00:03:59,586
that deals with the management
of a motorway network,

70
00:03:59,779 --> 00:04:02,735
the communal roads will be 
of no interest.

71
00:04:03,054 --> 00:04:04,791
As a result, we can have situations

72
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,801
that see the coexistence
of different scales.

73
00:04:08,138 --> 00:04:11,453
That is the case, for example, of
streams and catchment basins

74
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:14,735
with streams that can be described

75
00:04:14,916 --> 00:04:17,653
or represented on a very large
scale in 10 thousandth

76
00:04:17,834 --> 00:04:19,845
for maximum accuracy

77
00:04:20,547 --> 00:04:23,084
and topographic catchment basins

78
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:27,107
which are by nature much
more difficult to define

79
00:04:27,364 --> 00:04:30,716
and which may be described on
a scale of 25 thousandth.

80
00:04:31,388 --> 00:04:33,500
The observation and 
representation scales

81
00:04:33,671 --> 00:04:37,859
are closely linked because the map
is both a source of information

82
00:04:38,046 --> 00:04:41,441
on space elements and a
vector of representation.

83
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:46,370
The scale of representation should
thus correspond roughly

84
00:04:46,883 --> 00:04:50,532
to the threshold at which an
object becomes non-discernible,

85
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:54,081
which corresponds to a square 
of about 1 mm.

86
00:04:54,709 --> 00:04:57,084
In this example, we have drawn 4 squares

87
00:04:57,264 --> 00:05:01,528
of 10, 25, 50 and 100 m on
the scale of one thousand.

88
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:04,370
The representation size
of these objects decreases

89
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:05,744
when the scale is reduced,

90
00:05:05,916 --> 00:05:08,749
first at 2,500th then to 
5 thousandth.

91
00:05:08,995 --> 00:05:12,686
From the 10 thousandth, the 10 m square
reaches its perception limit

92
00:05:12,863 --> 00:05:14,813
and at the next stage,
we no longer see it

93
00:05:14,997 --> 00:05:18,186
and it is the 25 m square
which is at the limit and so on.

94
00:05:18,415 --> 00:05:20,552
We can rely on empirical rules

95
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:23,322
which would say for example that
for objects of a medium size

96
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,527
about ten meters,

97
00:05:24,718 --> 00:05:26,730
it should not be a representation scale

98
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:28,331
of less than 10 thousandth.

99
00:05:38,019 --> 00:05:40,018
The location of an object in space

100
00:05:40,189 --> 00:05:42,814
is based on the notions of
position and neighborhood

101
00:05:42,987 --> 00:05:45,041
so its location in
space on one hand

102
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:47,798
and its relation to others
objects on the other.

103
00:05:48,769 --> 00:05:52,019
The notions of neighborhood like
"the grocery store is near the church"

104
00:05:52,412 --> 00:05:54,488
are very effective in everyday life

105
00:05:54,668 --> 00:05:56,256
but do not provide a
frame of description

106
00:05:56,423 --> 00:05:57,697
which is suitable for complex objects

107
00:05:57,883 --> 00:06:00,682
such as those exploited in
geographic information systems.

108
00:06:01,003 --> 00:06:02,336
This requires a positioning

109
00:06:02,527 --> 00:06:04,390
method on the earth's surface

110
00:06:04,566 --> 00:06:07,179
which involves a reference
system and a metric,

111
00:06:07,407 --> 00:06:10,447
two conditions verified
by a Euclidean system.

112
00:06:10,901 --> 00:06:13,926
This system is based on the hypothesis
of a continuous space plan

113
00:06:14,095 --> 00:06:15,191
and of a constant metric

114
00:06:15,371 --> 00:06:18,001
defined by a system of perpendicular
axis between them.

115
00:06:18,397 --> 00:06:19,809
The surface of the earth is curved

116
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:22,226
and it is desirable, for obvious
convenience reasons,

117
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,700
to represent it on a flat surface.

118
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:26,911
This involves a geometric projection

119
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,621
to go from a spherical
positioning system

120
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:31,424
with 3 coordinates

121
00:06:31,615 --> 00:06:34,615
to a 2-coordinate plan
positioning system.

122
00:06:44,091 --> 00:06:45,853
The projection systems allow

123
00:06:46,027 --> 00:06:48,202
to establish a univocal
punctual relationship

124
00:06:48,374 --> 00:06:50,849
between the surface of the earth
and its flat representation.

125
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,565
From a geometric point of view,

126
00:06:52,738 --> 00:06:55,963
the earth constitutes an irregular
spherical tri-dimensional object

127
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:57,196
called "geoide".

128
00:06:57,771 --> 00:07:00,079
It is an equipotential surface in gravity

129
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:02,832
adjusted to an average level
of the surface of the sea

130
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:05,437
which presents swellings
at the level of continents

131
00:07:05,612 --> 00:07:07,787
and depressions at the
level of oceans.

132
00:07:08,285 --> 00:07:11,535
These gravimetric variations
explain that the terrestrial form

133
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:14,777
deviates locally from an 
ellipsoid of regular revolution.

134
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:16,758
The projection of the coordinates
of an object

135
00:07:16,949 --> 00:07:18,575
situated on the surface of the globe

136
00:07:18,751 --> 00:07:21,126
towards flat coordinates is
carried out in 2 steps:

137
00:07:21,305 --> 00:07:25,068
First, approximation of the geoid by
an ellipsoid of revolution.

138
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:26,385
Then, secondly,

139
00:07:26,568 --> 00:07:30,185
projection of coordinates on this
ellipsoid towards a flat surface.

140
00:07:30,451 --> 00:07:34,212
The approximation of the geoid by an
ellipsoid of revolution

141
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:36,996
can be done globally for all the planet,

142
00:07:37,184 --> 00:07:40,061
it is the principle of the World Geodetic System

143
00:07:40,244 --> 00:07:43,606
which latest version dates back to 1984,

144
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:47,808
which is why this ellipsoid 
is known as WGS84 .

145
00:07:48,309 --> 00:07:50,534
This adjustment can also be done locally

146
00:07:50,706 --> 00:07:54,382
to obtain a better accuracy on
an area of particular interest,

147
00:07:54,629 --> 00:07:57,316
which is the case for example
of Bessel's ellipsoid

148
00:07:57,502 --> 00:07:59,239
used in Switzerland.

149
00:08:00,784 --> 00:08:03,566
As we saw, going from
an ellipsoid of revolution

150
00:08:03,737 --> 00:08:05,211
to a flat surface

151
00:08:05,392 --> 00:08:08,269
involves going from a 3 spherical 
coordinates system 

152
00:08:08,456 --> 00:08:11,378
- latitude, longitude and
distance at the center -

153
00:08:11,585 --> 00:08:14,310
to a system of 2 Euclidean coordinates:

154
00:08:14,506 --> 00:08:16,675
- the East coordinate and
the North coordinate.

155
00:08:17,356 --> 00:08:19,106
The spherical and euclidean geometric laws 

156
00:08:19,277 --> 00:08:21,214
show that this operation
can't be carried out

157
00:08:21,393 --> 00:08:22,969
without a loss of information.

158
00:08:23,148 --> 00:08:26,272
So there are 3 types
of projection systems

159
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:28,659
that favour the conservation
of a property

160
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:30,247
to the detriment of the others.

161
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:33,426
These properties are the
orientation or direction,

162
00:08:33,633 --> 00:08:35,821
the surface and the distance.

163
00:08:36,235 --> 00:08:38,585
The projections which preserve
directions or angles

164
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,673
are called certified projections,

165
00:08:40,873 --> 00:08:42,727
the projections which preserve the surfaces

166
00:08:42,922 --> 00:08:44,812
are called equivalent projections

167
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:47,033
and the projections which
preserve the distances

168
00:08:47,205 --> 00:08:49,748
are called equidistant projections.

169
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:52,428
Beyond these properties,

170
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:55,920
the projection systems are
subdivided into 3 large families

171
00:08:56,108 --> 00:08:58,537
to which a number
of more or less exotic 

172
00:08:58,713 --> 00:08:59,999
projection systems are added.

173
00:09:00,223 --> 00:09:01,988
The first of these large
families is constituted

174
00:09:02,153 --> 00:09:03,919
by cylindrical projections.

175
00:09:04,593 --> 00:09:07,593
It consists in placing the
terrestrial globe inside a

176
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:11,000
generally tangent cylinder, even if
the one represented here is not,

177
00:09:11,248 --> 00:09:14,360
then projecting the points of
the surface of the globe

178
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,339
onto the walls of the cylinder,

179
00:09:16,521 --> 00:09:18,213
cutting the cylinder and

180
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,954
unfolding it to get the map.

181
00:09:21,706 --> 00:09:23,744
The most common form of
cylindrical projection

182
00:09:23,922 --> 00:09:27,197
is the Mercator projection which
is a conformal projection

183
00:09:27,386 --> 00:09:29,899
which preserves the
angles and directions.

184
00:09:31,169 --> 00:09:32,726
As we can see on this illustration

185
00:09:32,919 --> 00:09:35,181
this projection shows a 3 degree zone

186
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,947
on either side of the great
circle of tangency

187
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:41,317
where the other properties,
the surface and the distance,

188
00:09:41,498 --> 00:09:43,061
are sufficiently little altered

189
00:09:43,255 --> 00:09:45,492
so that the mapping is reliable.

190
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:49,201
The UTM projection is very widely used

191
00:09:49,384 --> 00:09:51,288
With declinations of the parameters

192
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:54,094
which depend on
the longitude of the place.

193
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:58,829
For example, UTM28 is used in Senegal

194
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:01,673
or UTM40 in the Seychelles.

195
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:04,160
Among the other cylindrical projections

196
00:10:04,344 --> 00:10:06,408
we can note the Gall-Peters' projection 

197
00:10:06,579 --> 00:10:08,081
which is an equivalent projection

198
00:10:08,267 --> 00:10:09,915
which preserves the surfaces

199
00:10:10,099 --> 00:10:13,390
and which gives a vision
somewhat different from the planet

200
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:15,993
than that of which we are accustomed.

201
00:10:16,268 --> 00:10:20,668
There is also an equidistant cylindrical
projection illustrated here.

202
00:10:21,397 --> 00:10:23,047
The second large projection family

203
00:10:23,241 --> 00:10:25,589
consists of conical projections.

204
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,748
It consist of placing a cone on
the terrestrial globe

205
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:33,313
and then projecting the points of
the surface of the globe on the cone,

206
00:10:33,812 --> 00:10:37,301
cutting the cone and
unfolding it to obtain the map.

207
00:10:38,467 --> 00:10:40,477
The most common  form
of conical projection

208
00:10:40,649 --> 00:10:42,658
is Lambert's conformal projection

209
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:45,369
which is also a projection 
that preserves

210
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:48,082
the directions or the angles.

211
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,099
This projection also has 
a tangential parallel

212
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:54,428
which defines a mapping area

213
00:10:54,596 --> 00:10:58,685
where surfaces and distances
are little altered by projection.

214
00:10:58,879 --> 00:11:02,495
This Lambert's conformal projection
is used by our french friends

215
00:11:02,683 --> 00:11:06,300
with 4 tangency parallels to
cover the whole territory.

216
00:11:06,741 --> 00:11:08,541
Among the other conical projections

217
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:11,971
let's note the Albers' projection which
is an equivalent projection

218
00:11:12,288 --> 00:11:14,773
and the equidistant conic projection.

219
00:11:15,615 --> 00:11:18,540
The third and last large family
of the projection systems

220
00:11:18,716 --> 00:11:21,520
consists of azimuthal projections.

221
00:11:21,723 --> 00:11:23,648
The principle of azimuthal projection

222
00:11:23,822 --> 00:11:26,059
consists of placing a tangent plan

223
00:11:26,254 --> 00:11:28,739
in a point of the revolution ellipsoid

224
00:11:28,919 --> 00:11:29,944
then projecting

225
00:11:30,142 --> 00:11:33,707
the points of the ellipsoid surface 
on this tangent plan

226
00:11:33,982 --> 00:11:36,677
which finally becomes the map.

227
00:11:36,892 --> 00:11:40,104
The different types of azimuthal
projections are distinguished

228
00:11:40,294 --> 00:11:43,829
by the position of the projection centre

229
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:47,809
which can be at the centre of the
earth for the gnomonic projections,

230
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:51,335
at the poles for the
stereographic projections,

231
00:11:51,535 --> 00:11:54,528
located in infinity for the
orthographic projections

232
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:57,982
which are projections
where each point is projecting

233
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,890
othogonally on the tangent plan.

234
00:12:01,314 --> 00:12:04,774
There is also a form of equivalent
projection:

235
00:12:05,245 --> 00:12:07,942
Lambert's equivalent azimuthal projection.

236
00:12:08,976 --> 00:12:12,514
These different legal references of
positioning have been numbered,

237
00:12:13,217 --> 00:12:17,060
they are therefore characterized by
a code,the EPSG code.

238
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:31,085
The numerous projection systems
used throughout the world

239
00:12:31,647 --> 00:12:34,276
have at some point been surveyed

240
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:38,472
by a geodesy, measurement and
mapping organization

241
00:12:38,659 --> 00:12:40,598
linked to oil exploration:

242
00:12:40,779 --> 00:12:43,742
The European Petroleum Survey Group,

243
00:12:43,927 --> 00:12:45,975
EPSG in an abbreviated form.

244
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:49,051
This databases, even if it is
not the only one of its kind

245
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,577
has become a factual reference.

246
00:12:51,982 --> 00:12:54,907
This is why the longitude latitude
coordinates system

247
00:12:55,106 --> 00:12:58,812
for the WGS84 ellipsoid of reference

248
00:12:59,394 --> 00:13:02,371
bears the code EPSG 4326.

249
00:13:03,963 --> 00:13:07,513
The Web Mercator coordinates
system used by the virtual globes,

250
00:13:07,711 --> 00:13:09,736
for example Google maps,etc..

251
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:12,186
bears the number 3857,

252
00:13:12,676 --> 00:13:16,353
the projection used in Switzerland, 
the 21781,

253
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:20,962
and the UMT 40 South projection
used in the Seychelles

254
00:13:21,352 --> 00:13:23,888
number 32740 .

255
00:13:25,078 --> 00:13:27,850
These various references can
be consulted on the following website:

256
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:29,965
spatialereference.org

257
00:13:30,136 --> 00:13:32,475
We can search for example the

258
00:13:32,722 --> 00:13:35,597
EPSG 4326 reference

259
00:13:35,787 --> 00:13:38,094
which corresponds to the
longitude latitude

260
00:13:38,275 --> 00:13:40,965
coordinates system for the WGS84.

261
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:46,328
And we find all the parameters 
in different formats

262
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:49,287
for this coordinates sytem

263
00:13:49,477 --> 00:13:53,545
for example here the Well Known
Text in HTML format.

264
00:13:54,263 --> 00:13:56,258
We can also search

265
00:13:56,903 --> 00:14:00,956
the 32740, the UTM40
South used in the Seychelles.

266
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,707
And we see that ...

267
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:05,958
in fact the use area

268
00:14:06,201 --> 00:14:09,632
of this coordinates
system on the right

269
00:14:09,832 --> 00:14:13,289
is restricted to a small
part of the planet

270
00:14:13,557 --> 00:14:15,695
and also we have access
to the parameters

271
00:14:15,881 --> 00:14:18,844
of this projection in a file.

272
00:14:19,991 --> 00:14:21,666
The reference 21781,

273
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:24,467
the coordinates system
used in Switzerland,

274
00:14:25,118 --> 00:14:29,617
we can see that in fact it covers
a very small area of ​​validity.

275
00:14:30,270 --> 00:14:33,712
We can also access all the
parameters of this projection

276
00:14:34,102 --> 00:14:35,950
in various formats:

277
00:14:36,183 --> 00:14:38,663
the Well Known Text in HTML form

278
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:42,508
the Proj4, the JSON, the GML, etc.

279
00:14:53,071 --> 00:14:54,850
So we have seen in this lesson

280
00:14:55,024 --> 00:14:59,580
that the geometric description of the
elements of the territory modeling

281
00:15:00,672 --> 00:15:02,364
is based on notions of scales,

282
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,086
coordinates systems
and projection systems.

283
00:15:05,261 --> 00:15:07,187
And we have seen more specifically

284
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:10,018
that the scale of representation
is closely linked

285
00:15:10,199 --> 00:15:14,828
to the spatial resolution
of the territory objects

286
00:15:15,031 --> 00:15:18,031
with lower thresholds of
10 thousandth

287
00:15:18,223 --> 00:15:19,873
for objects of about 10 m,

288
00:15:20,054 --> 00:15:22,954
of 25 thousandth for objects of 25 m

289
00:15:23,148 --> 00:15:26,634
of 50 thousandth for objects of 50 m, etc.

290
00:15:27,894 --> 00:15:30,103
We have also seen that the
representation

291
00:15:30,292 --> 00:15:33,292
of these elements in a plan

292
00:15:34,044 --> 00:15:35,464
requires to have

293
00:15:35,657 --> 00:15:38,657
an euclidean reference
system and a metric

294
00:15:39,141 --> 00:15:40,748
and that this implies

295
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:45,404
a projection of the terrestrial
spheroid to a flat surface.

296
00:15:46,385 --> 00:15:50,722
We have seen that this transposition
is done in 2 steps.

297
00:15:51,050 --> 00:15:55,000
First an approximation of the
geoid by an ellipsoid of revolution

298
00:15:55,419 --> 00:16:00,761
then a projection of the coordinates on
this ellipsoid towards a plan.

299
00:16:01,991 --> 00:16:04,370
We have also seen that
the approximation

300
00:16:04,537 --> 00:16:06,571
of the geoid by an ellipsoid

301
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:10,392
can be done in a global way, it is
the WGS84 system

302
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:12,312
or it can be ...

303
00:16:12,664 --> 00:16:15,290
based on a locally adjusted ellipsoid

304
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:19,198
to map a particular
area of ​​interest.

305
00:16:20,711 --> 00:16:21,948
At the level of projections,

306
00:16:22,146 --> 00:16:25,834
we have seen that going from 
a spherical system with 3 coordinates

307
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:28,966
to a 2-coordinate plan system

308
00:16:29,423 --> 00:16:31,410
implies a loss of information

309
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:34,787
and that it is for that reason 
that some projections

310
00:16:35,047 --> 00:16:38,947
preserve the direction or the angles,

311
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,352
and we are talking here about 
a conformal projection,

312
00:16:41,538 --> 00:16:44,376
whilst other projections 
preserve the surfaces,

313
00:16:44,565 --> 00:16:47,028
and we are talking of 
equivalent projection

314
00:16:47,222 --> 00:16:50,245
or projections that preserve 
the distance

315
00:16:50,424 --> 00:16:52,816
and which are equidistant projections.

316
00:16:53,608 --> 00:16:57,735
We have also seen that there
are three large projection families:

317
00:16:58,224 --> 00:17:00,780
The cylindrical projections,
the conical projections

318
00:17:01,106 --> 00:17:03,033
and the azimuthal projections.

319
00:17:04,113 --> 00:17:07,827
Finally, the ellipsoids of revolution and
the projection systems

320
00:17:08,842 --> 00:17:12,421
constitute a legal
reference of positioning

321
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,592
and these different systems

322
00:17:14,773 --> 00:17:17,975
have been inventoried and
are described by a code,

323
00:17:18,230 --> 00:17:20,621
the EPSG code.

324
00:17:20,883 --> 00:17:22,933
To those of you who wish

325
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:25,636
to explore these issues
of projection system,

326
00:17:25,828 --> 00:17:27,170
coordinate system,

327
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:28,733
I recommend the "elements

328
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:32,417
of geomatics" MOOC whose
address appears here.
