Welcome to this lesson on the geo-referencing of images.
The images and rasters must be positioned in the right place in a geographic information system to be used correctly.
The objective of this lesson is to familiarize yourself with the principles and the practice of the geo-referencing of images so that at the end you are able to geo-reference an image or manipulate the geo-referencing parameters of these images.
<i> During the lesson, we will discuss successively </ i></i>
<i> about the geo-referencing problem, </ i></i>
<i> a brief description of this problem, </ i></i>
<i> the methodology used to geo-reference an image, </ i></i>
<i> an example of application, how </ i></i>
<i> geo-referencing is done with the QGIS software </ i></i>
<i> and finally, how to store, how to save </ i></i>
<i> the characteristic parameters of a geo-reference. </ I></i>
<i> Let's start with the problematic </ i></i>
<i> which is that of an image inherited from an external source </ i></i>
<i> for example an old scanned card </ i></i>
<i> or an aerial photograph whose reference coordinates have been lost, </ i></i>
<i> so an ordinary image devoid of any spatial reference </ i></i>
<i> that we wish to integrate into a geographic information system. </ I></i>
<i> To do this, it is necessary to be able to place it in the right place </ i></i>
<i> so to reconstitute the corresponding spatial reference system. </ I></i>
<i> The operation is perfomed in two steps. </</i>
<i> First, we will identify a series of points </ i></i>
<i> common to the image and to a reference map </ i></i>
<i> on which this image has to integrate. </ I></i>
<i> And subsequently, we will modify, transform the image </ i></i>
<i> move it, rotate it, change its scale </ i></i>
<i> to adjust it to the reference map. </ I></i>
<i> We need at least three control points, </ i></i>
<i> if possible more, </ i></i>
<i> they should be easy to identify </ i></i>
<i> both on the map and in the starting image. </ I></i>
<i> And these points should be spread if possible </ i></i>
<i> throughout the area that has to be geo-referenced </ i></i>
<i> so that the deformation of the image is approximately ... </ i></i>
<i>so that it is well distributed let's say </ i></i>
<i> and that there is no singularity. </ i></i>
<i> This geometrical transformation is composed of a translation </ i></i>
<i> of a scaling and a rotation, </ i></i>
<i> all of these operations characterizing a Helmert transformation </ i></i>
<i> or an affine transformation. </ I></i>
<i> There are other types of possible transformations, </ i></i>
<i> in particular polynomial transformations </ i></i>
<i>of the first, second or third order, </ i></i>
<i> the use of spleens or projections. </ I></i>
<i> All these approaches are less frequent. </ I></i>
<i> They are especially useful when the starting map is not very regular </ i></i>
<i> and that the deformation can take into account </ i></i>
<i> some local particularities </ i></i>
<i> to allow very specific adjustments </ I></i>
<i> Most of the time, however, we will use a Helmert transformation. </ I></i>
<i> Who says change of scale and rotation also says new grid </ i></i>
<i> for which the value of each pixel must be evaluated, </ i></i>
<i> so resampling the starting grid. </ I></i>
<i> This resampling can use the nearest neighbor approach </ i></i>
<i> where we simply take the value </ i></i>
<i> of the nearest original map cell. </ I></i>
<i> Resampling by the nearest neighbor method </ i></i>
<i> is the one that best respects the original image </ i></i> so the one that will reduce the contrasts
<i> of the original image the least. </ I></i>
<i> The bi-linear bi-cubic approach is sometimes useful </ i></i>
<i> if the move, the scale change </ i></i>
<i> or the rotation are important </ i></i>
<i> and that the image in fact ... would become little readable </ i></i>
<i> because of the transformation. </ I></i>
Let's now take a concrete example </ i>
<i>of how geo-referencing is practiced </ i></i>
<i> with the QGIS software. </ I></i>
<i> So in QGIS, </ i></i>
<i>we will open the geo-referencing tool </ i></i>
<i> and in this tool, we will import the image to geo-reference </ i></i>
<i> in this case, an old map of MahÃ©. </ I></i>
<i> We are asked to specify the system of references </ i></i>
<i> the system of projections of references </ i></i>
<i> which must be the same as the projection system of the map. </ I></i>
<i>Then, we will add the control points, </ i></i>
<i> a first point on Pointe Matoopa </ i></i>
<i> to the West of MahÃ© and then a second point </ i></i>
<i>to the North-East on
Pointe MachabÃ©e, </ i></i>
<i> a third point near the airport, </ i></i>
<i> a fourth point to the South of the island </ i></i>
<i> and a last point to the South-West at Pointe Lazare. </ I></i>
<i> When we start the geo-referencing operation, </ i></i>
<i> the system asks us to specify the parameters of this transformation. </ I></i>
<i> We choose in this case amongst the types of transformation </ i></i>
<i> the Helmert transformation, </ i></i>
<i>a resampling by the nearest neighbors </ i></i>
<i> and then we specify the output file </ i></i>
<i> so a tif image file </ i></i>
<i> that will simply have the starting file name </ i></i>
<i> plus the word which is Georef. </ I></i>
<i> We must also specify the projection system released </ i></i>
<i> so in this case, we worked with Mercator web </ i></i>
<i> both for the starting map, </ i></i>
<i> the imported map and the resulting map. </ I</i>
<i> We start the operation and before closing, </ i></i>
<i> we are still asked to save the adjustment points, </ i></i>
<i> the control points that have been defined. </ I></i>
<i> And we see that this map was actually added </ i></i> to the geographic information system.
<i> We can modify its transparency in the properties </ i></i>
<i> to note that indeed </ i></i>
<i> this map-image is now placed in the right place. </ I></i>
<i> And by reviewing the various control points, </ i></i>
<i> we can see that the adjustment is not of such poor quality.</ I></i>
<i> A little bit of approximation here on the side of Baie Lazare... </ i></i>
<I> But overall, the adjustment is fairly accurate. </ I>
<i> Now let's see the parameters that define </ i></i>
<i> the transformation and how to store them. </ I></i>
<i> As I said earlier, a Helmert transformation </ i></i>
<i> is an affine transformation, </ i></i>
<i> that is to say a transformation which can be described </ i></i>
<i> by a linear combination of the x y coordinates, </ i></i>
<i> of the starting system.
So each coordinate </ i></i>
<i> of the arrival system, x' y' here, </ i></i>
<i> is expressed as a linear combination </ i></i>
<i> of the x y starting coordinates and then from a constant term. </ I></i>
<i> This system actually includes
6 parameters </ i></i>
<i> which are grouped together in what is called a World File </ i></i>
<i> describing in fact the geo-referencing of an image. </ I></i>
<i> And in this World File, these parameters are presented </ i></i>
<i> in the order described below with first the pixel size </ i></i>
<i> according to the x-axis, </ i></i>
<i> then the 2 rotation parameters around the y-axis and the x-axis, </ i></i>
<i> the size of the pixel according to y, </ i></i>
<i> and then finally the coordinates, the constant terms, </ i></i>
<i> the x y coordinates of the pixel center located on the top left of the image. </ I></i>
<i> So we see that if we define the position </ i></i>
<i> from the top left of the image, </ i></i>
<i> the cell size of the grid </ i></i>
<i> and then the rotation elements, </ i></i>
<i> we can actually position an image precisely </ i></i>
<i> in a geographic information system. </ I></i>
<i> In the example here to the right, </ i></i>
<i> when we have square pixels and no rotation, </ i></i>
<i> the angular terms are nil. </ I></i>
<i> And finally, the calculation of the coordinates of each point </ i></i>
<i> at the center of each pixel is quite simple. </ I></i>
<i> In the case where the transformation includes a rotation component, </ i></i>
<i> we see that in fact the D and B parameters </ i></i>
<i> are not in fact angles of rotation </ i></i>
<i> but represent the components according to x and y </ i></i>
<i> of the width and height of the pixel. </ I></i>
<i> And it is therefore more accurate to talk about components </ i></i>
<i> according to x and y, of projections rather than angular terms. </ I></i>
<i> Afterwards, the calculations become more complicated if the pixel is not square </ i></i>
<i> but that it has different dimensions according to y and according to x. </ I></i>
<i> These various parameters can be stored </ i></i>
<i> in an accompanying file, the World File precisely, </ i></i>
<i> with the rule that the accompanying file has the same name </ i></i>
<i> as the base file and an extension that depends </ i></i>
<i> on the image format, tfw for the tif </ i></i>
<i> and jgw for the jpeg, pgw for the png </ i></i>
<i> gfw for the gif. </ I></i>
<i> Or, the second possibility, </ i></i>
<i> store these information in the header of an image file in .tif format </ i></i>
<i> And we talk here about
GEOTIFF format </ i></i>
<i> since it is a single file </ i></i>
<i> that contains the geo-referencing information, </ i></i>
<i> so an image that intrinsically </ i></i>
<i> contains the geo-referencing information. </ I></i>
<i> The GeotiffExamine utility that is free to access </ i></i>
<i> makes it easy to check if a TIFF file has </ i></i>
<i> the geo-referencing information </ i></i>
<i> and, if so, generates a World File </ i></i>
<i> or conversely, when we have the World File, </ i></i>
<i> to fill in the header of the TIFF file </ i></i>
<i> to transform a TIFF into
Geotiff. </ I></i>
<i> We see for example that if we look for the geo-referenced file </ i></i>
<i> that we have just made and that we open this file </ i></i>
<i> with this utility, </ i></i>
<i> we see that the geo-referencing parameters </ i></i>
<i> are stored with the file itself </ i></i>
<i> and we can make the corresponding World File. </ I></i>
<i> As mentioned earlier, this World File has the tfw extension </ i></i>
<i> and if you open it with a simple text software, </ i></i>
<i> we find the 6 parameters that characterize </ i></i>
<i>the geometric transformation and the positioning of the image. </ I></i>
<i> The extension of this file, of this World File </ i></i>
<i> can be changed to jgw </ i></i>
<i> and the transformed name by removing the Georef suffix </ i></i>
<i> so that we can see that we can now import </ i></i>
<i> the original jpeg file using </ i></i>
<i>the geo-referencing information </ i></i>
<i> that was generated later. </ I></i>
<i> That is it. It is simple. </ I></i>
So, we are reaching the end of this lesson which has allowed us to review the principles and the practice of image geo-referencing and to see how we can manipulate, record and manipulate the referencing parameters in image files or in accompanying files.
