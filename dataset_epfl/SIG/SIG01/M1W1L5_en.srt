00:00:24,018 --> 00:00:24,957
Welcome to this lesson

2
00:00:25,157 --> 00:00:26,727
that will focus on metadata

3
00:00:27,268 --> 00:00:30,012
which are the data on the data

4
00:00:30,212 --> 00:00:32,020
and which play an extremely important role

5
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,835
to keep track

6
00:00:34,035 --> 00:00:35,412
of data acquisition

7
00:00:35,612 --> 00:00:38,295
that we do for geographic information systems.

8
00:00:40,049 --> 00:00:41,377
The objectives of this lesson

9
00:00:41,602 --> 00:00:42,331
consist in

10
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:44,739
emphasizing the importance of metadata,

11
00:00:44,947 --> 00:00:47,395
describing their content

12
00:00:47,595 --> 00:00:49,820
in the context of geo-information

13
00:00:50,413 --> 00:00:53,430
and show when and how
these metadata are used.

14
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,078
At the end of the lesson,

15
00:00:55,278 --> 00:00:57,056
You will be able to document

16
00:00:57,256 --> 00:00:58,157
a dataset

17
00:00:58,357 --> 00:01:01,357
and consult the metadata of a dataset

18
00:01:01,557 --> 00:01:02,509
in order to know

19
00:01:02,709 --> 00:01:05,143
if they match your needs or not.

20
00:01:05,741 --> 00:01:06,447
In this lesson,

21
00:01:06,647 --> 00:01:08,278
we will therefore address successively

22
00:01:08,478 --> 00:01:10,394
the general principles of documentation

23
00:01:10,594 --> 00:01:11,484
of a data set,

24
00:01:11,684 --> 00:01:12,878
we will then see

25
00:01:13,078 --> 00:01:16,205
the standardization efforts
that have been carried out

26
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:18,328
in the metadata field

27
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,985
and we will finish with a few examples

28
00:01:21,185 --> 00:01:24,305
illustrating the use of metadata.

29
00:01:30,548 --> 00:01:33,144
With the development
of information systems

30
00:01:33,344 --> 00:01:34,564
and databases

31
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:36,887
from the 60s, 70s,

32
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:40,402
we began to gather masses of information

33
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:42,321
in computer systems,

34
00:01:42,521 --> 00:01:43,778
only to realize

35
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:46,032
after a few months or years

36
00:01:46,232 --> 00:01:48,373
that all these data

37
00:01:48,610 --> 00:01:50,559
had become completely unusable

38
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:52,993
for lack of saving

39
00:01:53,193 --> 00:01:55,015
the memory of the conditions

40
00:01:55,227 --> 00:01:57,215
in which these data had been acquired,

41
00:01:57,438 --> 00:01:59,714
of the type of phenomena they represented,

42
00:01:59,914 --> 00:02:01,035
of the accuracy of data,

43
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:03,657
of a whole bunch of parameters of this type

44
00:02:03,857 --> 00:02:04,969
which in fact prevented

45
00:02:06,279 --> 00:02:07,835
the use of these data in the end.

46
00:02:08,035 --> 00:02:09,258
And we started talking

47
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,155
of this data cemetery syndrome

48
00:02:11,355 --> 00:02:14,126
since all these large databases

49
00:02:14,326 --> 00:02:15,898
were finally buried,

50
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,371
hence the following two axioms:

51
00:02:19,571 --> 00:02:20,148
first of all,

52
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,223
the idea that an information system

53
00:02:22,423 --> 00:02:24,839
and especially
a geographical information system

54
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:27,044
is alive if it is used,

55
00:02:27,681 --> 00:02:29,857
and that for such a system to be used,

56
00:02:30,057 --> 00:02:32,982
it must contain reliable data,

57
00:02:33,182 --> 00:02:34,594
up to date

58
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:36,450
and of which we know what they represent.

59
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:39,838
These two axioms have as a first corollary

60
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:41,674
to emphasize

61
00:02:41,874 --> 00:02:43,471
on the maintenance

62
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:45,083
and the updating of data

63
00:02:45,283 --> 00:02:47,604
which can represent a significant effort,

64
00:02:48,172 --> 00:02:49,745
and as a second corollary,

65
00:02:49,945 --> 00:02:52,167
the fact that the volume and the nature

66
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:53,427
of the data stored

67
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:54,903
in an information system

68
00:02:55,103 --> 00:02:57,621
must be adapted to the needs

69
00:02:57,821 --> 00:02:58,944
of the users

70
00:02:59,144 --> 00:03:01,069
and to the available resources

71
00:03:01,269 --> 00:03:04,094
to organize the maintenance and the updating.

72
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,583
This is why

73
00:03:05,783 --> 00:03:07,966
the concept of Big Data,

74
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:11,132
which is very fashionable lately,

75
00:03:11,332 --> 00:03:13,770
is encountering a certain scepticism

76
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,304
from many people

77
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:16,040
whom I am.

78
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,108
The metadata,

79
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:19,362
as data on the data,

80
00:03:19,562 --> 00:03:21,267
aim at documenting

81
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:22,840
spatial information

82
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,418
so that it is understood

83
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:25,545
in the same way

84
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:27,021
by all its users.

85
00:03:27,899 --> 00:03:28,570
This implies

86
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:31,089
that each data layer,

87
00:03:31,289 --> 00:03:33,081
that each object, each attribute,

88
00:03:33,281 --> 00:03:35,278
is described and characterized

89
00:03:35,478 --> 00:03:36,539
from its scale and its nature

90
00:03:36,739 --> 00:03:39,155
point of view.

91
00:03:39,701 --> 00:03:41,849
If we look now a little closer

92
00:03:42,049 --> 00:03:43,823
at what metadata is all about,

93
00:03:44,023 --> 00:03:47,033
the first aspect that we address

94
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,216
is that of the source of information,

95
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:52,596
where the institution can be documented

96
00:03:52,796 --> 00:03:53,937
who produced the data,

97
00:03:54,137 --> 00:03:56,746
possibly the institution
that published it,

98
00:03:57,227 --> 00:03:59,155
that distributes these data,

99
00:03:59,355 --> 00:04:00,987
who is the contact person,

100
00:04:01,187 --> 00:04:04,209
who assumes the responsibility
of updating for example,

101
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:05,638
Etc. Etc.

102
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:08,059
A second important element

103
00:04:08,259 --> 00:04:09,119
is the content.

104
00:04:09,778 --> 00:04:12,013
Here, in the cadastral data example,

105
00:04:13,162 --> 00:04:15,061
first the name and the description

106
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:15,879
of these data.

107
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,745
They are said to come
from official measurements,

108
00:04:18,945 --> 00:04:21,465
that they include realty and soil cover,

109
00:04:21,677 --> 00:04:22,700
that they are extracted

110
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,851
from an official cadastral database.

111
00:04:25,051 --> 00:04:26,580
Etc. Etc.

112
00:04:28,054 --> 00:04:29,433
The type of data,

113
00:04:29,633 --> 00:04:31,629
geometric, temporal data,

114
00:04:31,829 --> 00:04:34,517
numerical values â€‹â€‹of integer or real type,

115
00:04:34,717 --> 00:04:36,411
character chains,

116
00:04:36,611 --> 00:04:38,878
vectors, object structures, etc.

117
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,582
In our cadastral data example,

118
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:43,949
the plot itself is represented...

119
00:04:44,149 --> 00:04:45,018
is of the geometry type

120
00:04:45,218 --> 00:04:46,622
represented by a polygon,

121
00:04:47,244 --> 00:04:48,622
whilst the attributes,

122
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:50,337
council number, plot number,

123
00:04:50,537 --> 00:04:51,354
are integers,

124
00:04:51,554 --> 00:04:54,267
the designation and the link, character chains.

125
00:04:55,449 --> 00:04:56,262
An information

126
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,135
on the reference scale

127
00:04:58,335 --> 00:04:59,684
and the accuracy of data,

128
00:04:59,884 --> 00:05:02,481
we see here that the scale
of the cadastral plan

129
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:04,113
was determined

130
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:06,778
at the time of data entry,

131
00:05:06,978 --> 00:05:08,855
usually the 500th scale

132
00:05:09,055 --> 00:05:09,851
in urban areas,

133
00:05:10,051 --> 00:05:11,429
of the 1,000th in agricultural zones

134
00:05:11,629 --> 00:05:13,549
and the 5,000th in mountain areas.

135
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:15,092
The data entry date

136
00:05:15,292 --> 00:05:17,975
or the availability date

137
00:05:18,175 --> 00:05:21,656
of these data on the infrastructure data,

138
00:05:21,856 --> 00:05:24,509
here the 31st December 1983.

139
00:05:24,709 --> 00:05:26,171
The quantitative elements

140
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:28,240
constitute another aspect of the metadata

141
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,578
including the spatial overlap,

142
00:05:30,778 --> 00:05:33,401
in the case of our cadastral data,

143
00:05:33,601 --> 00:05:35,592
the whole of the canton of Vaud

144
00:05:35,792 --> 00:05:37,319
and the bounding box,

145
00:05:37,519 --> 00:05:42,285
that is to say the framework which
includes all the data concerned,

146
00:05:43,157 --> 00:05:45,172
volume values

147
00:05:45,372 --> 00:05:48,844
like the number of objects
involved in the data set

148
00:05:49,044 --> 00:05:50,575
or possibly the disk space

149
00:05:50,775 --> 00:05:51,897
occupied by these data.

150
00:05:52,097 --> 00:05:53,862
The access modalities to the data

151
00:05:54,062 --> 00:05:55,802
are obviously a very important element,

152
00:05:56,002 --> 00:05:57,854
in particular the format

153
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,746
in which the data is distributed,

154
00:05:59,946 --> 00:06:01,876
the associated rights,

155
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:04,116
the tariffs which can, as seen here,

156
00:06:04,316 --> 00:06:05,325
be consulted online,

157
00:06:06,184 --> 00:06:07,487
the eventual restrictions

158
00:06:07,687 --> 00:06:09,575
which apply to the use of data,

159
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:11,826
the service address

160
00:06:12,026 --> 00:06:14,357
or the person in charge of the distribution,

161
00:06:14,557 --> 00:06:15,973
here, the State of Vaud.

162
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:25,673
For several years,

163
00:06:25,873 --> 00:06:28,200
many efforts to standardize metadata

164
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,412
have been undertaken,

165
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:31,244
efforts aimed at enabling

166
00:06:31,444 --> 00:06:33,262
a better understanding

167
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:35,179
of geo-data at different levels,

168
00:06:35,379 --> 00:06:37,196
whether it is that of the producer,

169
00:06:37,396 --> 00:06:38,512
that of the administrator

170
00:06:38,712 --> 00:06:40,082
or the end user,

171
00:06:40,282 --> 00:06:42,909
to facilitate the trades

172
00:06:43,109 --> 00:06:45,106
between various partners and systems,

173
00:06:45,862 --> 00:06:47,496
to improve the capacity

174
00:06:47,696 --> 00:06:50,001
to search for geographic data

175
00:06:50,201 --> 00:06:51,159
and finally

176
00:06:51,359 --> 00:06:53,238
to create a reference framework

177
00:06:53,438 --> 00:06:55,170
for the development of methods

178
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,856
and metadata management tools.

179
00:06:58,056 --> 00:06:59,575
At the international level

180
00:06:59,775 --> 00:07:02,493
the body in charge of standardization

181
00:07:02,693 --> 00:07:04,904
in the â€‹â€‹geographic information

182
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:06,529
and geomatic field

183
00:07:06,729 --> 00:07:10,086
is known as ISO / TC 211.

184
00:07:10,876 --> 00:07:12,628
This organization produced

185
00:07:12,828 --> 00:07:15,181
the ISO 19100 series of norms

186
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:17,939
some of which are specific 
to metadata,

187
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:23,267
in particular the 19115 
and the 19115-2,

188
00:07:23,467 --> 00:07:25,743
which are about the description 
of geo-data,

189
00:07:25,943 --> 00:07:28,034
the 19119

190
00:07:28,234 --> 00:07:30,001
on the description of geo-services

191
00:07:30,201 --> 00:07:33,201
and the 19139

192
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:34,613
on the exchange of metadata.

193
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:36,175
At the European Union level,

194
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,296
the standardization takes place

195
00:07:38,496 --> 00:07:41,008
through the INSPIRE Directive,

196
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:42,683
in the U.S.

197
00:07:42,883 --> 00:07:47,417
it is the Federal Geographic 
Data Committee

198
00:07:47,617 --> 00:07:49,139
and in Switzerland,

199
00:07:49,339 --> 00:07:50,919
it's the GM03 standard.

200
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:53,811
All these norms
are ultimately very similar

201
00:07:54,011 --> 00:07:57,576
since they group the same 
basic data type

202
00:07:57,776 --> 00:08:01,524
with some specific variants.

203
00:08:12,115 --> 00:08:14,005
We will now see some examples

204
00:08:14,205 --> 00:08:16,241
of uses and consultation

205
00:08:16,441 --> 00:08:17,270
of metadata

206
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:20,080
beginning with the geoportal

207
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,444
of the IGN-France.

208
00:08:23,566 --> 00:08:24,614
In this geoportal,

209
00:08:24,814 --> 00:08:28,874
we can activate the data 
catalogue directly,

210
00:08:29,074 --> 00:08:30,905
as well as a display area

211
00:08:31,105 --> 00:08:32,228
of the data selection.

212
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:35,797
We choose to display the layer

213
00:08:35,997 --> 00:08:38,700
of the buildings that appear on the map

214
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,478
and in the selection area,

215
00:08:40,678 --> 00:08:43,090
we have the different layers
with an information button

216
00:08:43,290 --> 00:08:45,505
which provides access to metadata,

217
00:08:45,705 --> 00:08:47,341
in this case, the name, a description,

218
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:48,902
the data producer

219
00:08:49,102 --> 00:08:49,955
and the legend

220
00:08:50,155 --> 00:08:51,601
which we see is different

221
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:54,344
when the scale is smaller than the 30,000th

222
00:08:54,544 --> 00:08:55,575
or greater.

223
00:08:55,775 --> 00:08:57,245
So, if you zoom in a bit

224
00:08:57,445 --> 00:08:58,337
in this map

225
00:08:58,537 --> 00:08:59,727
to get closer a little,

226
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:01,714
to see these things on a smaller scale,

227
00:09:01,914 --> 00:09:02,968
we see that indeed,

228
00:09:03,168 --> 00:09:04,992
the richness of description

229
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:07,570
is a little larger with a greater variety

230
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,628
of building types.

231
00:09:09,828 --> 00:09:11,270
The data catalogue

232
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:13,113
is also directly accessible

233
00:09:13,313 --> 00:09:16,584
with the list of different data available.

234
00:09:16,784 --> 00:09:19,096
Here, we choose the cadastral plots

235
00:09:19,296 --> 00:09:20,582
to display them.

236
00:09:24,087 --> 00:09:26,796
We see that these plots

237
00:09:26,996 --> 00:09:28,885
occupy the entire country by default.

238
00:09:29,085 --> 00:09:31,366
So we zooms for a more precise zone

239
00:09:31,566 --> 00:09:33,369
to have some detailed information.

240
00:09:33,569 --> 00:09:34,793
And again,

241
00:09:34,993 --> 00:09:37,167
the access to metadata

242
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:38,906
is done by the "information" button,

243
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:41,075
the name, a description,

244
00:09:41,275 --> 00:09:42,221
the input scale,

245
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:43,909
the legend, etc.

246
00:09:45,101 --> 00:09:46,558
In the data catalog,

247
00:09:46,758 --> 00:09:48,511
we can add for the example

248
00:09:48,711 --> 00:09:50,310
a transport-related layer,

249
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:52,391
in this case, the road network,

250
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,276
this road network

251
00:09:56,651 --> 00:09:59,119
on a larger scale

252
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:00,427
appears more clearly,

253
00:10:00,627 --> 00:10:02,324
and again the "information" button

254
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:04,809
gives access to some metadata,

255
00:10:06,919 --> 00:10:08,892
particularly the producer which is the IGN

256
00:10:09,092 --> 00:10:10,982
and the legend of the road network.

257
00:10:11,182 --> 00:10:13,253
We see that in the case of IGN-France,

258
00:10:13,453 --> 00:10:14,969
the richness in metadata

259
00:10:15,169 --> 00:10:16,362
is relatively low.

260
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:20,396
Second example, the geoportal
of the Walloon region.

261
00:10:20,596 --> 00:10:22,268
We see that on the homepage,

262
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:25,184
we have a direct access to the geo-catalog

263
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:27,109
with several themes

264
00:10:27,321 --> 00:10:28,481
and in each theme,

265
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:30,744
a set of applications

266
00:10:30,944 --> 00:10:35,191
which are all GIS web systems

267
00:10:35,391 --> 00:10:36,891
accessible online

268
00:10:37,091 --> 00:10:39,108
and for each of these applications,

269
00:10:39,308 --> 00:10:40,422
a fact sheet

270
00:10:40,622 --> 00:10:43,636
with in particular
the use access conditions,

271
00:10:43,836 --> 00:10:44,696
the quality of data,

272
00:10:44,896 --> 00:10:46,451
the contact person etc.

273
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:49,057
The same for geo-data

274
00:10:49,257 --> 00:10:50,279
with for example here

275
00:10:50,479 --> 00:10:52,482
for the land use map of Wallonia

276
00:10:52,682 --> 00:10:54,906
all the relevant metadata.

277
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,674
The data can be accessed

278
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:02,464
directly in an online map

279
00:11:03,551 --> 00:11:06,532
and in the online interface we find 

280
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:08,113
the data catalogue

281
00:11:08,313 --> 00:11:10,543
with its various themes.

282
00:11:11,246 --> 00:11:13,140
Here the regional road network.

283
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:14,520
And for each theme,

284
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,558
as earlier

285
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,333
an information button

286
00:11:17,533 --> 00:11:20,123
which gives access to the same fact sheet

287
00:11:20,323 --> 00:11:23,079
containing keywords,

288
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:24,660
the updating dates,

289
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,429
the use access conditions,

290
00:11:27,629 --> 00:11:29,100
the quality of data,

291
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:32,098
the contact person etc.

292
00:11:34,117 --> 00:11:36,231
Here we see in the quality the scale

293
00:11:36,431 --> 00:11:38,403
and the way

294
00:11:38,603 --> 00:11:40,518
with which the dataset has been constituted,

295
00:11:40,718 --> 00:11:42,828
especially here on the basis
of digitalization,

296
00:11:43,491 --> 00:11:45,794
and the contact details
of the contact person

297
00:11:45,994 --> 00:11:47,662
if necessary.

298
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:51,632
In an additional button

299
00:11:51,832 --> 00:11:53,820
offering access to more information,

300
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:56,795
we have access to the complete model 

301
00:11:56,995 --> 00:11:57,728
of metadata,

302
00:11:57,928 --> 00:12:00,008
with the possibility of choosing

303
00:12:00,208 --> 00:12:01,300
the type of presentation,

304
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:03,139
according to the European norm,

305
00:12:03,339 --> 00:12:06,147
the American norm or others

306
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:07,505
and different actions,

307
00:12:07,718 --> 00:12:09,257
including the possibility of exporting

308
00:12:09,457 --> 00:12:11,285
these data in different formats.

309
00:12:11,812 --> 00:12:13,133
These complete metadata

310
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,910
include general information,

311
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:20,619
of elements describing
the origin of the resource,

312
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:23,091
the geometrical aspects,

313
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:29,714
the contact details of 
the contact person

314
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:31,286
for the metadata,

315
00:12:31,486 --> 00:12:33,833
the technical information elements

316
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:37,302
such as the use access conditions etc.

317
00:12:41,649 --> 00:12:44,561
The geoportal of the Swiss Confederation

318
00:12:45,301 --> 00:12:47,347
which, in its interface,

319
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,740
also includes the data catalogue,

320
00:12:50,647 --> 00:12:53,113
with data classified by thematic

321
00:12:53,313 --> 00:12:54,754
and here we will search

322
00:12:54,954 --> 00:12:56,862
in the land cover / use

323
00:12:57,062 --> 00:12:59,197
a map of the forests diversity.

324
00:13:00,325 --> 00:13:02,352
Also a small button of information

325
00:13:02,552 --> 00:13:04,267
which gives access to the metadata,

326
00:13:04,467 --> 00:13:05,799
so the name and description

327
00:13:05,999 --> 00:13:07,204
of this layer

328
00:13:07,404 --> 00:13:09,179
which was built on a Landsat image,

329
00:13:09,379 --> 00:13:11,929
the legend and additional information,

330
00:13:12,129 --> 00:13:13,335
particularly a link

331
00:13:13,535 --> 00:13:15,807
to the website

332
00:13:16,007 --> 00:13:17,972
of the data geocatalogue

333
00:13:19,346 --> 00:13:20,846
which includes

334
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:22,544
the entire metadata

335
00:13:22,744 --> 00:13:24,430
of the different layers concerned,

336
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:26,833
the possibility to export them

337
00:13:27,033 --> 00:13:28,443
in different formats.

338
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,182
These metadata contain
a set of information,

339
00:13:33,382 --> 00:13:35,069
the reference information,

340
00:13:35,269 --> 00:13:37,250
a descriptive summary,

341
00:13:38,850 --> 00:13:42,264
the data of the contact person

342
00:13:42,464 --> 00:13:44,221
for the resource,

343
00:13:44,421 --> 00:13:47,843
the same for the update
and the scheduled update dates,

344
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:50,322
the constraints of use,

345
00:13:50,522 --> 00:13:52,331
particularly the existence of a license,

346
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,418
the numerical,

347
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:55,348
quantitative aspects,

348
00:13:55,548 --> 00:13:56,603
so the covered area,

349
00:13:56,803 --> 00:13:58,286
the method of distribution,

350
00:13:58,486 --> 00:13:59,815
in particular the formats,

351
00:14:00,838 --> 00:14:02,567
the reference system used

352
00:14:02,767 --> 00:14:03,896
so the projection system,

353
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,060
the quality of data,

354
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,336
the metadata managers

355
00:14:08,536 --> 00:14:10,275
and the information

356
00:14:10,475 --> 00:14:12,707
on the legislative framework

357
00:14:12,907 --> 00:14:17,202
which in fact includes
the use of these data.

358
00:14:21,714 --> 00:14:22,929
Another example,

359
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:26,111
with the hydrographic network,

360
00:14:30,934 --> 00:14:31,988
we see here

361
00:14:32,188 --> 00:14:34,103
that the metadata also includes

362
00:14:34,303 --> 00:14:36,254
the detailed legend

363
00:14:36,454 --> 00:14:39,342
of the different types
of watercourse sections

364
00:14:39,542 --> 00:14:40,869
and again links

365
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:43,307
to different pieces of information,

366
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,818
in this case also

367
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,616
the geocatalogue

368
00:14:47,418 --> 00:14:50,326
where we find the same data structure

369
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:51,411
as earlier,

370
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:54,162
with this time having perhaps 

371
00:14:54,362 --> 00:15:00,481
the scale of 25,000th 
as a particularity

372
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:03,768
which was used to 
digitalize the data,

373
00:15:06,192 --> 00:15:09,104
the formats in which
this data is available,

374
00:15:09,304 --> 00:15:10,684
so the ESRI shapefile,

375
00:15:10,884 --> 00:15:14,616
but also the different Internet links,

376
00:15:14,816 --> 00:15:15,475
the hyperlinks,

377
00:15:15,675 --> 00:15:17,094
which enable to access

378
00:15:17,294 --> 00:15:18,981
the Swisstopo store,

379
00:15:19,181 --> 00:15:20,860
the Swisstopo online store

380
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,596
which allows to buy these data,

381
00:15:24,314 --> 00:15:26,576
the system of reference projection,

382
00:15:26,776 --> 00:15:29,144
EPSG: 21781,

383
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:31,833
which we have already talked about
in a previous lesson

384
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:34,966
and the contact information

385
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,138
for the management of metadata,

386
00:15:39,084 --> 00:15:40,306
to conlude again

387
00:15:40,506 --> 00:15:42,375
by the legislative elements,

388
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:45,196
in particular the order 
on geo-information,

389
00:15:45,396 --> 00:15:47,435
which is the legal framework

390
00:15:47,635 --> 00:15:50,213
which establishes the use of
geographical data in Switzerland.

391
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,995
And finally the geoportal
of the Canton of Vaud,

392
00:15:56,982 --> 00:16:00,907
in which we displayed

393
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:02,803
the layers related to land property

394
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:06,236
and we zoom on
the small village of Arnex-sur-Orbe

395
00:16:06,436 --> 00:16:08,955
to find the cadastral data

396
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:10,347
that we used

397
00:16:10,547 --> 00:16:11,815
in our previous examples,

398
00:16:12,015 --> 00:16:13,842
the parcel with its attributes

399
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:18,148
and we see that the link points
to the land register data

400
00:16:18,348 --> 00:16:20,620
with the type of land use

401
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,345
and the owner of the plot.

402
00:16:22,937 --> 00:16:25,433
We see that the basic data,

403
00:16:25,633 --> 00:16:26,397
the realty,

404
00:16:27,694 --> 00:16:30,342
the metadata can be consulted 
directly online

405
00:16:30,542 --> 00:16:32,735
and there is an analog system

406
00:16:32,935 --> 00:16:33,773
to what we have already seen

407
00:16:33,973 --> 00:16:34,701
with the name,

408
00:16:34,901 --> 00:16:37,628
the description of the layer,

409
00:16:37,828 --> 00:16:39,903
and then a series of tabs

410
00:16:40,103 --> 00:16:42,614
which can open or close

411
00:16:42,814 --> 00:16:45,743
to access various other aspects

412
00:16:45,943 --> 00:16:46,561
of the metadata,

413
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:50,322
in this case a link to the pricing of data,

414
00:16:50,522 --> 00:16:53,735
a link to the data structure,

415
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:55,033
towards the data model

416
00:16:55,233 --> 00:16:56,021
which was used,

417
00:16:56,221 --> 00:17:00,795
a concept that we will discuss
in the second module of the course.

418
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:03,941
We also see

419
00:17:04,141 --> 00:17:07,346
that other types of information
can be displayed,

420
00:17:07,546 --> 00:17:12,280
here the information relating
to the water protection field,

421
00:17:14,421 --> 00:17:16,216
with in particular

422
00:17:16,988 --> 00:17:18,623
the hydrographic network

423
00:17:20,409 --> 00:17:21,546
and in this case

424
00:17:21,746 --> 00:17:24,621
in the region, a particular watercourse

425
00:17:24,821 --> 00:17:26,302
which is the Talent

426
00:17:26,502 --> 00:17:27,772
if I am not mistaken, yes the Talent,

427
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,325
with the attributes related
to this watercourse,

428
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:33,434
so its identifier,

429
00:17:33,634 --> 00:17:34,937
its number etc.

430
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,055
and again the access

431
00:17:37,255 --> 00:17:41,052
to the metadata of
the hydrographic network layer

432
00:17:41,252 --> 00:17:42,681
and we see that this layer comes from

433
00:17:42,881 --> 00:17:44,744
a system called Gesreau,

434
00:17:44,944 --> 00:17:48,833
which is in fact the watercourse 
management GIS

435
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:49,876
of the Canton of Vaud,

436
00:17:50,076 --> 00:17:51,728
the data are accessible to the public,

437
00:17:51,928 --> 00:17:53,575
the pricing rules

438
00:17:53,775 --> 00:17:54,990
are known,

439
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:57,332
there is a basic rate of 25 francs

440
00:17:57,532 --> 00:18:00,345
to recover and use these data,

441
00:18:00,962 --> 00:18:03,309
the principles of diffusion,

442
00:18:03,509 --> 00:18:06,287
some technical complement elements,

443
00:18:06,487 --> 00:18:07,573
the reference system

444
00:18:07,773 --> 00:18:09,405
so it is the same
projection system,

445
00:18:09,605 --> 00:18:12,098
it is a Swiss projection
that has been used,

446
00:18:13,319 --> 00:18:16,568
the date on which the data was created,

447
00:18:16,768 --> 00:18:18,341
the date of the last update,

448
00:18:20,062 --> 00:18:23,931
and finally those responsible 
for the diffusion.

449
00:18:25,593 --> 00:18:26,329
To conclude

450
00:18:26,529 --> 00:18:28,451
we will see how to document

451
00:18:28,651 --> 00:18:29,576
a data set

452
00:18:29,776 --> 00:18:30,655
in QGIS,

453
00:18:30,855 --> 00:18:32,485
the GIS software

454
00:18:32,685 --> 00:18:33,778
that we will use

455
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:35,408
throughout this course.

456
00:18:37,982 --> 00:18:39,546
We will use for this

457
00:18:39,746 --> 00:18:41,928
a project containing data from 
the Seychelles,

458
00:18:42,128 --> 00:18:44,970
a project whose preparation

459
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:46,502
is the subject of a lesson

460
00:18:46,702 --> 00:18:48,671
which will be presented as part of the

461
00:18:48,871 --> 00:18:50,692
second module of this course.

462
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:53,176
we see that by right clicking

463
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:54,374
on the layer of hotels,

464
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:56,795
these properties can be accessed,

465
00:18:57,989 --> 00:19:00,206
amongst which a heading

466
00:19:00,406 --> 00:19:01,922
contains the metadata

467
00:19:02,122 --> 00:19:04,971
with a descriptive part,

468
00:19:05,171 --> 00:19:06,738
a title, hotels,

469
00:19:06,938 --> 00:19:10,708
a short summary to describe
in fact what it is about,

470
00:19:12,347 --> 00:19:14,301
possibly a list of keywords,

471
00:19:14,501 --> 00:19:16,304
a data format,

472
00:19:16,504 --> 00:19:18,067
so text or HTML,

473
00:19:18,675 --> 00:19:21,373
possibly an Internet link,

474
00:19:21,573 --> 00:19:22,790
a URL address,

475
00:19:23,604 --> 00:19:25,945
and then a set of properties

476
00:19:26,145 --> 00:19:28,890
which have already been defined,

477
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:31,860
in particular the data format,
the ESRI shapefile,

478
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:34,118
the type of geometry of points,

479
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,153
the number of objects

480
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,918
and the hold in the units

481
00:19:39,118 --> 00:19:41,247
of the projection system used,

482
00:19:41,447 --> 00:19:44,628
and the coordinates of this projection system,

483
00:19:44,828 --> 00:19:46,953
so UTM zone 40 South.

484
00:19:47,532 --> 00:19:50,302
Another example with the district layer

485
00:19:50,978 --> 00:19:53,022
where we see again that by default,

486
00:19:53,222 --> 00:19:55,107
the data type

487
00:19:55,307 --> 00:19:57,774
is an SQL Spatial Lite database,

488
00:19:57,974 --> 00:20:00,227
with the address of
the file containing this data,

489
00:20:00,427 --> 00:20:01,166
the type of data,

490
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,037
the polygons, the number of objects,

491
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:03,861
25

492
00:20:04,061 --> 00:20:05,092
and again

493
00:20:05,292 --> 00:20:07,168
the total hold of the layer

494
00:20:07,368 --> 00:20:10,765
and then the projection system used,

495
00:20:10,965 --> 00:20:12,954
so again UTM 40 South.

496
00:20:13,759 --> 00:20:15,873
We see that in the standard
version of QGIS,

497
00:20:16,073 --> 00:20:19,122
the possibilities of documenting a data set

498
00:20:19,322 --> 00:20:20,617
are relatively limited.

499
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:22,072
There are several extensions

500
00:20:22,297 --> 00:20:23,810
which are under development

501
00:20:23,997 --> 00:20:25,928
which will, gradually with time,

502
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:27,543
correct this existing situation

503
00:20:27,743 --> 00:20:30,059
and offer more complete instruments

504
00:20:30,259 --> 00:20:32,102
for the metadata capture.

505
00:20:41,878 --> 00:20:43,596
So we saw during this lesson

506
00:20:43,796 --> 00:20:46,308
that metadata play a very important role

507
00:20:46,508 --> 00:20:48,131
in describing

508
00:20:48,331 --> 00:20:49,915
the datasets that we use

509
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:52,133
in geographical information systems.

510
00:20:52,612 --> 00:20:54,934
We have seen the type of information

511
00:20:55,147 --> 00:20:55,984
which were stored,

512
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:57,062
name, description,

513
00:20:57,262 --> 00:20:58,418
creation date

514
00:20:58,618 --> 00:20:59,894
type of content etc.

515
00:21:00,471 --> 00:21:02,386
We have seen that these elements

516
00:21:02,586 --> 00:21:05,581
had been the subject of several
standardization efforts

517
00:21:05,781 --> 00:21:08,126
in order to have a

518
00:21:08,326 --> 00:21:10,886
a somewhat unified description
of the data sets

519
00:21:11,617 --> 00:21:13,049
and we also saw

520
00:21:13,249 --> 00:21:15,805
that these elements were used

521
00:21:16,005 --> 00:21:16,785
particularly

522
00:21:16,985 --> 00:21:20,207
in national data infrastructures,

523
00:21:20,407 --> 00:21:22,143
the national geoportals

524
00:21:22,343 --> 00:21:23,726
in France, Belgium, Switzerland,

525
00:21:23,926 --> 00:21:26,009
to describe

526
00:21:26,209 --> 00:21:27,886
the available data sets.
