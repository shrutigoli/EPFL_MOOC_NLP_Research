1
00:00:21,674 --> 00:00:23,924
We saw in the 2 last lessons

2
00:00:24,113 --> 00:00:26,388
that the vectorization of data

3
00:00:26,555 --> 00:00:30,282
represents a considerable, 
tedious work,

4
00:00:30,487 --> 00:00:33,800
and that the automation of this process

5
00:00:33,984 --> 00:00:36,558
allows only partially to save

6
00:00:37,097 --> 00:00:39,395
the effort that must be made.

7
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,145
It is therefore quite important

8
00:00:41,326 --> 00:00:44,787
when data have been digitalized 
and entered

9
00:00:45,125 --> 00:00:46,537
to make them available

10
00:00:46,707 --> 00:00:49,327
to as many users as possible.

11
00:00:49,787 --> 00:00:53,712
This is why most international
organizations,

12
00:00:53,914 --> 00:00:55,331
most countries

13
00:00:55,918 --> 00:00:57,856
provide elaborated data sets

14
00:00:58,068 --> 00:01:00,690
more and more often

15
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:02,049
particularly in the context

16
00:01:02,224 --> 00:01:04,616
of national geodata infrastructures.

17
00:01:05,415 --> 00:01:09,941
This lesson will therefore
focus on these sources of geodata

18
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:14,437
and their consultation and
integration into GIS projects.

19
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:17,146
The objectives of this lesson are

20
00:01:17,315 --> 00:01:20,231
to offer you a guided tour

21
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:22,974
of the main areas in which we find

22
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:25,166
Internet data sets

23
00:01:25,412 --> 00:01:27,750
so that at the end of the lesson

24
00:01:27,953 --> 00:01:31,730
you are able on one hand
to go to look for these data sets

25
00:01:31,917 --> 00:01:35,805
even if web addresses can be 
changed in the meantime

26
00:01:36,107 --> 00:01:37,959
so to go looking
for these data sets

27
00:01:38,129 --> 00:01:40,078
but also to integrate them

28
00:01:41,182 --> 00:01:44,036
into a GIS project in the QGIS software.

29
00:01:45,336 --> 00:01:46,920
Data sources include

30
00:01:47,114 --> 00:01:50,064
2 types of data which we will address
successively.

31
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:53,697
Firstly the data available 
on geoservers

32
00:01:53,974 --> 00:01:56,274
and then the data 
available for download

33
00:01:56,457 --> 00:01:58,612
amongst which we will distinguish

34
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:02,034
digital model data of altitude,

35
00:02:02,217 --> 00:02:03,931
satellite imagery,

36
00:02:04,156 --> 00:02:07,788
physical geography data and
human geography data.

37
00:02:16,723 --> 00:02:18,644
The data available on geoservers

38
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,655
are therefore geodata accessible
by Internet

39
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:24,290
in a client-server architecture.

40
00:02:25,003 --> 00:02:27,506
The client is usually a web browser

41
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:30,988
and the server a remote machine that
houses a software

42
00:02:31,559 --> 00:02:34,890
that is able to listen
to the traffic on the Internet network

43
00:02:35,093 --> 00:02:37,015
and respond to queries.

44
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:38,937
The requests are sent by a browser

45
00:02:39,121 --> 00:02:41,145
as a HTTP chain

46
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:46,094
and the geoserver  is a software
capable of sending back geodata

47
00:02:46,312 --> 00:02:49,399
either in a vectorial form or 
in an image form

48
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:51,072
in response to such requests.

49
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:53,965
The transfer of images or rasters

50
00:02:54,158 --> 00:02:57,870
that represent large Internet 
data volumes

51
00:02:58,052 --> 00:02:59,591
represents an obstacle

52
00:02:59,902 --> 00:03:04,423
hence the use of tile
decomposition of these images.

53
00:03:05,017 --> 00:03:06,767
The principle of this decomposition

54
00:03:06,968 --> 00:03:09,636
relies on the definition of 
a certain number

55
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,365
of set zoom levels

56
00:03:11,528 --> 00:03:14,015
and at each new zoom level

57
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:15,165
the previous image

58
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:18,234
which is a small image of 
256 pixels on the side

59
00:03:18,508 --> 00:03:20,206
is divided in 4

60
00:03:21,194 --> 00:03:23,784
and again in 4 at 
the next zoom levels.

61
00:03:24,182 --> 00:03:26,388
The different tiles are numbered

62
00:03:26,679 --> 00:03:29,504
but unfortunately with slightly
different systems

63
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:32,813
for Google, TMS and Quadtree.

64
00:03:33,147 --> 00:03:34,414
We see that in the case of Google

65
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,945
the numbering starts at 
the top on the left

66
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:39,634
with a decreasing Y axis

67
00:03:39,807 --> 00:03:42,894
whilst in the TMS case,
we start at the bottom on the left

68
00:03:43,108 --> 00:03:45,978
with an increasing Y axis.

69
00:03:47,138 --> 00:03:49,070
The tiling can be 
performed automatically

70
00:03:49,253 --> 00:03:51,106
by the geoservers softwares

71
00:03:51,303 --> 00:03:53,956
and the user simply drops

72
00:03:54,177 --> 00:03:57,145
the complete image on the server

73
00:03:57,455 --> 00:04:00,013
or this tiling can be done manually

74
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,529
using a Gdal2tile tool

75
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,865
which is part of the Gdal toolbox

76
00:04:06,053 --> 00:04:08,544
accessible on this Internet address.

77
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,615
The geoservers softwares
provide their tiles series

78
00:04:12,821 --> 00:04:15,902
in the form of WMS and WFS services.

79
00:04:16,396 --> 00:04:20,759
WMS for Web Map Service
and WFS for Web Feature Service,

80
00:04:21,014 --> 00:04:22,902
in the first case we transfer images

81
00:04:23,094 --> 00:04:26,297
and in the second case vectorial objects.

82
00:04:26,645 --> 00:04:28,496
Access to these web services

83
00:04:28,935 --> 00:04:32,450
involves the use of
configured HTTP requests

84
00:04:32,755 --> 00:04:36,654
with a number of keywords in
particular the type of request

85
00:04:37,184 --> 00:04:39,572
which in the case of the WMS,

86
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,263
can be a capacity request,

87
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:44,229
what is the server able to send

88
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:46,597
as data layer in particular,

89
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:50,148
of research for a specific card,

90
00:04:50,337 --> 00:04:52,002
of information research

91
00:04:52,188 --> 00:04:54,350
on the objects that 
compose this map.

92
00:04:54,591 --> 00:04:58,110
In the case of WFS servers,
we find the same principle

93
00:04:58,395 --> 00:05:01,504
but with slightly 
different functionalities

94
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:05,361
including queries that 
search this time,

95
00:05:05,536 --> 00:05:07,948
and in certain cases when
editing is possible,

96
00:05:08,129 --> 00:05:11,379
some requests which allow to block
the editing of an object

97
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:15,293
and to record a transaction
so a modification of this object.

98
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:18,120
Amongst the other settings,
the layers to be selected,

99
00:05:18,306 --> 00:05:19,468
the area of ​​interest,

100
00:05:19,636 --> 00:05:22,879
the format of the objects
that we want to have in return

101
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:27,936
either jpeg, png image format for maps

102
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:32,851
or GML, GeoJSON format for 
vectorial objects.

103
00:05:34,357 --> 00:05:38,651
We have here a QGIS project that
represents the Lausanne region.

104
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:42,747
We add the browser that
allows to access the file tree

105
00:05:42,957 --> 00:05:47,382
and there we find a heading that
inventories the WMS services.

106
00:05:48,022 --> 00:05:50,385
A new WMS connection is created

107
00:05:50,594 --> 00:05:52,544
which is documented with a name

108
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,527
and with an address

109
00:05:54,724 --> 00:05:58,329
which is the HTTP address

110
00:05:58,523 --> 00:06:01,008
of the Swiss Federal 
Administration servers.

111
00:06:02,805 --> 00:06:05,218
This connection is added to
the list of connections

112
00:06:05,407 --> 00:06:08,382
and, when we selected...
when we select it

113
00:06:08,561 --> 00:06:11,723
we send a query of GET Capacity type

114
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,845
to retrieve the list of available
layers on this service

115
00:06:16,524 --> 00:06:20,311
and we see that amongst
these layers, here we have a layer ...

116
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:24,149
Mosaic Landsat that gives
a satellite picture ...

117
00:06:24,716 --> 00:06:26,725
at a low resolution.

118
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,225
Amongst these different layers,

119
00:06:28,394 --> 00:06:32,394
we also see here the
canton borders layer,

120
00:06:32,609 --> 00:06:35,609
of different Swiss cantons.

121
00:06:39,534 --> 00:06:41,821
We see in this list of available services

122
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:46,082
a heading that inventories
the Web Feature Services

123
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:51,585
and we will also add here a
new WFS connection type

124
00:06:52,168 --> 00:06:56,480
which is about the canton of Neuchâtel
so we will call it "Neuchâtel"

125
00:06:57,409 --> 00:06:59,952
and then we paste the address

126
00:07:00,524 --> 00:07:02,583
at which this service is available.

127
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:04,916
Similarly a first click will ...

128
00:07:05,107 --> 00:07:06,903
lead to load the available data layers

129
00:07:07,072 --> 00:07:08,814
and we see that the
data layer available,

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,930
the only available

131
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:14,177
it is the layer of municipalities
of the canton of Neuchâtel.

132
00:07:19,003 --> 00:07:20,368
Here, it appears.

133
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:21,958
We then see

134
00:07:22,143 --> 00:07:24,943
that by right clicking on 
this municipality layer

135
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:27,963
we access its attributes,
its attribute table

136
00:07:28,137 --> 00:07:30,950
and we see that it is indeed
a vectorial layer with objects

137
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:34,784
whose only available attribute 
is the identifier.

138
00:07:35,038 --> 00:07:37,315
These objects can be selected

139
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:40,770
or consulted with the 
information access tool

140
00:07:40,964 --> 00:07:43,552
and we see that in the 
information available,

141
00:07:43,763 --> 00:07:46,276
we find the properties of 
a vectorial object

142
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,119
namely the perimeter and the
area since it is a polygon.

143
00:07:52,364 --> 00:07:56,193
The virtual globes are a special category

144
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:59,526
of data accessible by geo-server

145
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:02,861
with as main sources

146
00:08:03,714 --> 00:08:06,889
OpenStreetMap here for the city of Dakar,

147
00:08:07,077 --> 00:08:10,904
Google maps in map and
satellite image version,

148
00:08:11,467 --> 00:08:14,725
Bing maps, so the Google equivalent
product of Microsoft,

149
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:20,023
MapQuest which is another 
cartography source of map type,

150
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:24,323
Yahoo maps also in satellite image,

151
00:08:24,557 --> 00:08:27,314
Yandex maps of russian servers

152
00:08:27,537 --> 00:08:30,803
and finally the maps
provided by ArcGIS online.

153
00:08:31,734 --> 00:08:33,516
The integration of these different

154
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:36,080
virtual globes data sources in QGIS

155
00:08:36,267 --> 00:08:39,167
goes through the OpenLayer plugin

156
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:40,888
which is usually installed 
automatically.

157
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:41,757
we see that

158
00:08:41,934 --> 00:08:44,884
we have here the list
of the different...

159
00:08:45,439 --> 00:08:49,148
the list is not necessarily
complete but a list of a certain number

160
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:52,140
of virtual globes that can
be added to the map,

161
00:08:52,308 --> 00:08:55,925
here first the OpenStreetMap map for
the island of Mahe in the Seychelles

162
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:59,198
and satellite image of Bing.

163
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:03,367
So if we zoom in a little in 
the area of ​​the capital, Victoria,

164
00:09:05,288 --> 00:09:08,956
we see the details of these images
and map.

165
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:12,377
This OpenStreetMap plugin

166
00:09:12,574 --> 00:09:16,374
is an extension that is 
automatically installed as I said

167
00:09:16,561 --> 00:09:20,158
but which must sometimes 
be installed on foot,

168
00:09:20,334 --> 00:09:21,927
it is, like all extensions,

169
00:09:22,109 --> 00:09:24,204
in this "extensions" menu.

170
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:28,341
Finally we find various 
tools on Internet

171
00:09:28,543 --> 00:09:31,511
which allow to download the tiles

172
00:09:31,693 --> 00:09:34,434
of these virtual globes maps

173
00:09:34,627 --> 00:09:39,336
and to amalgamate them into a mosaic
to achieve a complete picture.

174
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,824
we see here an example

175
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,749
of a

176
00:09:44,582 --> 00:09:45,917
commercial software

177
00:09:46,108 --> 00:09:49,620
which enables to recover 
almost all the tiles

178
00:09:49,831 --> 00:09:53,648
of all the types of virtual
globes that I evoked earlier

179
00:09:54,112 --> 00:09:57,099
with different levels of
zoom and then we define

180
00:09:57,909 --> 00:10:02,550
an area of ​​interest by these coordinates
in latitude and longitude.

181
00:10:12,109 --> 00:10:13,844
Besides the virtual globes,

182
00:10:14,026 --> 00:10:16,328
downloading data are about

183
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,285
digital models of altitude.

184
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:22,974
First, data from the Aster satellite

185
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,044
from 30 m of resolution

186
00:10:25,222 --> 00:10:29,515
which are accessible on
the two sites mentioned here.

187
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:31,573
These sites
offer an interface

188
00:10:31,752 --> 00:10:34,196
in which we can choose
the area of interest,

189
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:37,588
here the Kilimanjaro area

190
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:41,269
and then later retrieve different ...

191
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:45,366
the different images which compose
this digital model of altitude.

192
00:10:46,527 --> 00:10:47,814
Another possibility,

193
00:10:47,994 --> 00:10:51,094
the SRTM data at 30
or 90 m resolution

194
00:10:51,432 --> 00:10:53,663
that come from
the US space shuttle

195
00:10:54,358 --> 00:10:56,460
here also with an interface

196
00:10:56,626 --> 00:10:59,235
that allows to select
an area of ​​interest

197
00:10:59,432 --> 00:11:03,555
and then to recover the corresponding
digital model of altitude.

198
00:11:04,194 --> 00:11:05,769
We see that the
differences in resolution

199
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:09,564
translate into differences in
granularity of the obtained model.

200
00:11:10,494 --> 00:11:12,256
Finally, altimetric data

201
00:11:12,446 --> 00:11:14,504
which are more about bathymetry

202
00:11:14,689 --> 00:11:18,255
with the Marine
Geoscience Data System

203
00:11:19,197 --> 00:11:20,516
which also offers an interface

204
00:11:20,703 --> 00:11:23,458
allowing to select an area of ​​interest

205
00:11:23,717 --> 00:11:27,645
and retrieve the
data in different formats

206
00:11:28,593 --> 00:11:31,356
regarding the digital model of altitude

207
00:11:31,542 --> 00:11:34,947
including the submarine model.

208
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:47,024
The satellite imagery field 
is a bit special

209
00:11:47,219 --> 00:11:49,794
in the sense that the 
high-resolution images

210
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,348
are generally provided

211
00:11:53,325 --> 00:11:55,493
by commercial companies.

212
00:11:56,153 --> 00:11:58,311
The images available
and freely accessible

213
00:11:58,491 --> 00:12:00,501
are generally of a lower resolution

214
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:02,715
in the order of 10 m for Sentinel images

215
00:12:02,905 --> 00:12:05,034
and 30 m for Landsat images,

216
00:12:05,217 --> 00:12:08,722
up to 15 m for the panchromatic
band in the latter case.

217
00:12:09,422 --> 00:12:12,076
In the easily accessible images
amongst the best sites

218
00:12:12,262 --> 00:12:15,234
the Copernicus website of the
European Space Agency,

219
00:12:15,690 --> 00:12:18,564
Earth Explorer of the
US Geological Service,

220
00:12:18,941 --> 00:12:21,716
or the Global Data Explorer
of the same service,

221
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,366
or the NASA Reverb site.

222
00:12:24,582 --> 00:12:26,061
In the 4 cases we have an interface

223
00:12:26,237 --> 00:12:28,859
which allows to select an area 
of ​​interest on a map

224
00:12:29,066 --> 00:12:31,553
and then to explore the
different product types

225
00:12:31,724 --> 00:12:35,415
provided by different satellites and
various measuring instruments

226
00:12:35,605 --> 00:12:38,477
for different years and in different
periods of the year.

227
00:12:39,342 --> 00:12:40,655
Commercially,

228
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,798
many very high resolution images

229
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:45,762
that are sold and often very expensive

230
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:48,138
with GeoEye satellites

231
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,624
which have very very low resolutions

232
00:12:50,794 --> 00:12:54,386
34 cm for the best,

233
00:12:55,132 --> 00:12:58,896
Worldview, the Pleiades satellites of
the European Space Agency

234
00:12:59,170 --> 00:13:01,873
QuickBird, Ikonos, etc. etc.

235
00:13:02,234 --> 00:13:05,805
Many companies provide or 
sell these images,

236
00:13:06,206 --> 00:13:08,118
the one mentioned here

237
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:10,055
is only one amongst all these companies.

238
00:13:10,246 --> 00:13:13,384
It has the advantage of providing 
almost all the range

239
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:16,005
of existing high resolution images.

240
00:13:24,843 --> 00:13:26,543
In the physical
geography field,

241
00:13:26,721 --> 00:13:28,121
first for general data,

242
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:30,764
the GEOSS site, which
is an access portal

243
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:33,212
to a large number of
information sources

244
00:13:33,406 --> 00:13:35,439
then the Natural Earth site.

245
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,107
This website offers

246
00:13:37,293 --> 00:13:40,293
both raster and vector data

247
00:13:40,512 --> 00:13:42,362
for different topics

248
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:45,914
which are related to physical geography.

249
00:13:46,429 --> 00:13:49,291
In the climatic weather 
field, we have Worldclim

250
00:13:49,523 --> 00:13:54,118
which provides globally 
fairly high resolution maps

251
00:13:55,078 --> 00:13:58,241
of climatic parameters,
the average rainfall

252
00:13:58,429 --> 00:14:00,742
for the year, for different
months of the year,

253
00:14:00,993 --> 00:14:03,590
temperatures, etc.

254
00:14:04,002 --> 00:14:07,140
Hydrosheds, which
provides catchment basins

255
00:14:07,332 --> 00:14:10,232
and hydrographic networks of
the waterways

256
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:13,815
for all the catchment basins 
of the planet

257
00:14:14,615 --> 00:14:16,796
and the Global Land Ice Measurements,

258
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:21,701
which provides information
on all the glaciers,

259
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,247
as we can see here 
the different glaciers

260
00:14:24,444 --> 00:14:26,890
of the western Switzerland alps.

261
00:14:27,599 --> 00:14:30,696
For the ground we have Soilgrids

262
00:14:31,575 --> 00:14:34,520
and Globcover for the ground cover 

263
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:38,692
and the Landcover layer
of Climate Change Initiative

264
00:14:39,011 --> 00:14:42,887
which actually took over
from Globcover.

265
00:14:43,488 --> 00:14:47,086
In the field of environment, forests

266
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:50,687
with the percentage of forest cover,

267
00:14:51,289 --> 00:14:52,967
the data provided

268
00:14:53,138 --> 00:14:55,690
by the United Nations
Environment Program

269
00:14:56,671 --> 00:14:58,100
and data from

270
00:14:58,275 --> 00:15:01,580
the US Agency for
Environmental Protection.

271
00:15:02,681 --> 00:15:04,622
Finally in the field of ​​resources,

272
00:15:04,794 --> 00:15:07,794
we have a portal for geology

273
00:15:08,674 --> 00:15:11,861
and here a site that constitutes a

274
00:15:12,303 --> 00:15:14,260
global observatory of energy.

275
00:15:23,713 --> 00:15:25,601
In the field of human geography,

276
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,753
we find general data

277
00:15:28,991 --> 00:15:30,603
on the Natural Earth site

278
00:15:30,789 --> 00:15:35,056
including the administrative
limits data:

279
00:15:36,006 --> 00:15:38,219
public places, urban areas,

280
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:40,881
transport infrastructure, etc.

281
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:42,387
Again,

282
00:15:42,594 --> 00:15:45,556
the United Nations Program
on Environment site

283
00:15:45,741 --> 00:15:48,166
which contains many data

284
00:15:48,729 --> 00:15:51,729
particularly in relation with
the population

285
00:15:51,922 --> 00:15:54,686
or with socio-economic themes.

286
00:15:55,381 --> 00:15:58,273
Other useful sources of information

287
00:15:58,699 --> 00:16:00,716
from the human geography perspective,

288
00:16:00,998 --> 00:16:03,905
it is all the maps provided
by the World Bank

289
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:08,426
and finally the center of application
and socioeconomic data

290
00:16:08,778 --> 00:16:10,864
related I believe to NASA

291
00:16:11,267 --> 00:16:13,354
which is found here.

292
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:14,894
For more targeted thematic

293
00:16:15,068 --> 00:16:17,646
we find Worldpop for the
population

294
00:16:18,501 --> 00:16:20,001
and for toponymy,

295
00:16:20,193 --> 00:16:23,193
the Geonames site with here

296
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:27,646
a selection of toponyms from Ghana

297
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:32,371
and for the administrative limits,
Global Administrative Areas,

298
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:34,892
a site that provides

299
00:16:35,204 --> 00:16:38,204
the administrative limits
of level 0 so national

300
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,018
and of level 1 - 2 - 3

301
00:16:40,634 --> 00:16:44,373
for the subdivisions, by districts,
by municipalities, etc. etc.

302
00:16:54,352 --> 00:16:56,565
So, we have looked at

303
00:16:56,762 --> 00:16:59,212
the different types of data sources

304
00:16:59,388 --> 00:17:01,226
that are found on the Internet

305
00:17:01,408 --> 00:17:05,440
either in the form of
geo-server, of web service

306
00:17:05,616 --> 00:17:09,125
or in the form of data
accessible for download.

307
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:11,903
We have also seen how these
different types of data

308
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,257
could be integrated to GIS 
projects in QGIS.
