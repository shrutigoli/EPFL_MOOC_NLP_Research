1
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:23,998
Good morning.

2
00:00:24,198 --> 00:00:28,951
I am pleased to present a case study

3
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:35,528
covering the biodiversity of
Senegal-Mauritania.

4
00:00:35,728 --> 00:00:46,279
The purpose of this lesson is to
illustrate the role and contributions

5
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:48,785
of geographic information systems

6
00:00:48,985 --> 00:00:56,492
in a biodiversity conservation project.

7
00:00:56,692 --> 00:01:03,029
<I> We will break down
the presentation plan </ i>

8
00:01:03,304 --> 00:01:08,179
<I> of this case study where
we will first </ i>

9
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:10,585
<I> talk about the Senegal 
river valley, </ i>

10
00:01:10,773 --> 00:01:16,602
<I> then break down the objectives </ i>

11
00:01:16,802 --> 00:01:20,820
<I> to describe the methodology
that was used </ i>

12
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:25,909
<I> and finally present the results. </ I>

13
00:01:31,434 --> 00:01:36,172
<I> We are in a part of the world
called the Sahel </ i>

14
00:01:36,372 --> 00:01:41,010
<I> that has no major interest </ i>

15
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:45,747
<I> in terms of biodiversity. </ I>

16
00:01:45,947 --> 00:01:49,493
<I> Fortunately today, </ i>

17
00:01:49,693 --> 00:01:55,684
<I> there is attention given
to these areas. </ I>

18
00:01:55,884 --> 00:01:59,410
<I> And so we will look </ i>

19
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:05,331
<I> at the Senegal river valley </ i>

20
00:02:05,531 --> 00:02:11,018
<I> that extends, for the part
that we are interested in, </ i>

21
00:02:11,218 --> 00:02:15,462
<I> from the Senegal river 
delta to Bakel </ i>

22
00:02:15,662 --> 00:02:21,637
on a strip of 50 kilometers
on either side of the Senegal river

23
00:02:21,837 --> 00:02:27,375
over an area of ​​60,000 km2.

24
00:02:27,575 --> 00:02:33,111
<I> So this is an area that
provides a habitat for unique species. </ I>

25
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:35,800
<I> We have, in the Senegal 
river valley, </ i>

26
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
<I> an ecosystem diversity. </ I>

27
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,200
<I> We have 4 types of ecosystems. </ I>

28
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,400
<I> We have the sandy Ferlo, 
the lateritic Ferlo, </ i>

29
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,600
<I> we also have floodplains </ i>

30
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,557
<I> and wetlands. </ I>

31
00:02:50,757 --> 00:02:56,572
<I> This diversity of ecosystems 
in the valley </ i>

32
00:02:56,772 --> 00:03:00,383
<I> is linked particularly
to climatic variations, </ i>

33
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:05,533
<I> to geological and 
pedological variations. </ I>

34
00:03:05,739 --> 00:03:09,359
<I> In this part of
the Senegal river valley, </ i>

35
00:03:09,559 --> 00:03:12,806
<I> we also have a diversity
of ethnic groups and lifestyles. </ I>

36
00:03:13,006 --> 00:03:16,860
<I> We have the Soninkés, Toucouleurs, 
Fulanis, Wolofs, Moors </ i>

37
00:03:17,047 --> 00:03:19,040
<I> which are different ethnic groups. </ I>

38
00:03:19,336 --> 00:03:21,361
<I> We also have sedentary farmers, </ i>

39
00:03:21,561 --> 00:03:25,120
<I> breeders, diversity
of agricultural activities, </ i>

40
00:03:25,345 --> 00:03:28,295
<I> the cultivation of rice,
millet, sugar cane. </ I>

41
00:03:28,495 --> 00:03:31,989
<I> We also have
extensive farming, fishing. </ I>

42
00:03:41,309 --> 00:03:46,807
We will stop a little on
the objectives of the project.

43
00:03:47,007 --> 00:03:52,238
First to say that in this area
of ​​the Senegal river valley,

44
00:03:52,438 --> 00:03:55,704
there was a loss of biodiversity

45
00:03:55,904 --> 00:03:59,819
due to the expansion of agriculture,

46
00:04:00,019 --> 00:04:07,349
the increasing use of some
tree essences in construction.

47
00:04:07,549 --> 00:04:10,162
Regarding the objectives of the project,

48
00:04:10,362 --> 00:04:14,131
we first have preservation 
of biodiversity

49
00:04:14,331 --> 00:04:17,331
through the restoration 
of degraded soils.

50
00:04:17,531 --> 00:04:23,089
Our goal is also sustainable
ecosystem management

51
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:27,653
with the involvement 
of the population.

52
00:04:27,853 --> 00:04:31,209
Finally, a contribution to
the fight against poverty

53
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:36,436
by the generation, the creation
of new sources of income.

54
00:04:36,636 --> 00:04:41,314
Information systems have an important role

55
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,514
in achieving these objectives

56
00:04:44,714 --> 00:04:51,246
since GIS have the role
of collecting and storing data,

57
00:04:51,471 --> 00:04:55,128
communication and information sharing,

58
00:04:55,328 --> 00:05:01,014
and also the analysis of
land use and its dynamic.

59
00:05:09,764 --> 00:05:12,866
<I> Regarding the approach followed </ i>

60
00:05:13,066 --> 00:05:17,834
<I> in the case of the 
analysis of land use, </ i>

61
00:05:18,034 --> 00:05:20,683
<I> 4 steps must be emphasized. </ I>

62
00:05:20,883 --> 00:05:25,339
<I> The first step is the selection
and processing of images </ i>

63
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:29,803
<I> the second step, the
supervised classification, </ i>

64
00:05:30,003 --> 00:05:33,003
<I> the third step, the 
diachronic analysis </ i>

65
00:05:33,203 --> 00:05:36,203
<I> and the fourth step, the 
vectorization, digitalization </ i>

66
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:39,680
<I> and addition of vectorial layers. </ I>

67
00:05:39,880 --> 00:05:48,390
<I> With regards to the selection
step and the image processing, </ i>

68
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:55,063
<I> you should know that
we used Landsat images, </ i>

69
00:05:55,263 --> 00:06:00,525
<I> 30 m resolution
with several spectral bands. </ I>

70
00:06:00,775 --> 00:06:06,629
<I> The optimal acquisition period
of these images </ i>

71
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:09,950
<I> is between mid-October
and late December. Why? </ I>

72
00:06:10,150 --> 00:06:14,566
<I> Because that is when 
the wood cover </ i>

73
00:06:14,766 --> 00:06:19,041
<I> still keeps its leaves. </ I>

74
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:26,296
<I> It is also at this time
that crop areas </ i>

75
00:06:26,496 --> 00:06:29,412
<I> are easily recognizable. </ I>

76
00:06:29,612 --> 00:06:35,965
<I> We have also done 
mosaic images </ i>

77
00:06:36,165 --> 00:06:39,165
<I> since considering the extent 
of the study area, </ i>

78
00:06:39,365 --> 00:06:45,746
<I> we had to have 7 Landsat scenes
to cover the study area </ i>

79
00:06:45,946 --> 00:06:52,709
<I> and so it was necessary to do
a mosaic of these 7 Landsat scenes. </ I>

80
00:06:52,959 --> 00:06:59,976
<I> After the image processing step, </ i>

81
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:07,356
<I> there is the supervised 
classification step </ i>

82
00:07:07,556 --> 00:07:14,126
<I> with a combination of spectral bands </ i>

83
00:07:14,326 --> 00:07:17,326
<I> and field studies </ i>

84
00:07:17,526 --> 00:07:23,638
<I> to identify the characteristic 
"sample" areas. </ I>

85
00:07:23,876 --> 00:07:27,713
<I> There is also the identification </ i>

86
00:07:27,913 --> 00:07:33,076
<I> of the spectral signature
of the sample areas </ i>

87
00:07:33,276 --> 00:07:37,527
<I> and finally, the generalization
of these signatures </ i>

88
00:07:37,727 --> 00:07:41,242
<I> for the entire study area. </ I>

89
00:07:41,442 --> 00:07:46,937
After the supervised 
classification step,

90
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:50,137
we carry out a diachronic analysis.

91
00:07:50,337 --> 00:07:54,617
What is this analysis?

92
00:07:54,817 --> 00:08:00,119
<I> It consists in counting </ i>

93
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:07,825
<I> surfaces / pixels
in each land use category. </ I>

94
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:13,059
<I> Next, there is an overlay
of raster layers </ i>

95
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:19,583
<I> to highlight the pixels
that have changed land use </ i>

96
00:08:19,783 --> 00:08:25,431
<I> between the two dates,
that is to say between 1984 and 2003. </ I>

97
00:08:25,631 --> 00:08:31,434
<I> Still in this methodology part, </ i>

98
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:36,879
<I> we also have 3 other steps </ i>

99
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:46,071
<I> not less important in the 
elaboration of vectorial layers. </ I>

100
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:51,611
<I> It is first the vectorization 
of land use. </ I>

101
00:08:51,811 --> 00:08:58,014
<I> Then digitalizing certain elements </ i>

102
00:08:58,214 --> 00:09:06,811
<I> like road networks,
some localities, etc. </ I>

103
00:09:07,036 --> 00:09:10,322
<I> and also the integration
of external sources </ i>

104
00:09:10,522 --> 00:09:19,039
<I> since there are layers,
data layers </ i>

105
00:09:19,239 --> 00:09:22,064
<I> that exist in other institutions </ i>

106
00:09:22,264 --> 00:09:27,072
<I> such as the administrative limits. </ I>

107
00:09:27,272 --> 00:09:32,524
<I> Thirdly, we also try to integrate </ i>

108
00:09:32,736 --> 00:09:34,384
<I> these external sources. </ I>

109
00:09:44,257 --> 00:09:49,123
<I> And for the results obtained: </ i>

110
00:09:49,323 --> 00:09:56,804
<I> let's stop for a moment
on the land use of 1984. </ I>

111
00:09:57,004 --> 00:10:03,679
<I> What we should say is that
the classification of satellite imagees </ i>

112
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:08,706
<I> brings out 7 vegetation types. </ I>

113
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:16,250
<I> The other terms favorable
to the existence of habitats </ i>

114
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,993
<I> are related to surface waters. </ I>

115
00:10:19,193 --> 00:10:27,042
<I> The ecosystems still reflect 
a certain diversity. </ I>

116
00:10:27,242 --> 00:10:33,821
<I> On the map of 2003, the same number
of classes as in 1984 </ i>

117
00:10:34,021 --> 00:10:39,078
<I> was listed. This shows that
the evolution of the environment </ i>

118
00:10:39,278 --> 00:10:43,802
<I> has not resulted in theme 
appearances or disappearances, </ i>

119
00:10:44,002 --> 00:10:48,869
<I> the natural information among
which the shrub steppe </ i>

120
00:10:49,069 --> 00:10:51,589
<I> composing by far the first class. </ I>

121
00:10:51,789 --> 00:10:54,098
<I> That is also important to note. </ I>

122
00:10:54,298 --> 00:10:59,121
<I> Between 1984 and 2003, </ i>

123
00:10:59,321 --> 00:11:04,731
<I> major changes in the occupancy
and use of the space </ i>

124
00:11:04,931 --> 00:11:10,733
<I> took place in the Senegal 
river basin in general </ i>

125
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:13,829
<I> and the delta and valley 
in particular. </ I>

126
00:11:14,029 --> 00:11:18,783
<I> So between 1984 and 2003,
major modifications </ i>

127
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:21,713
<I> in the occupation and 
use of space </ i>

128
00:11:21,913 --> 00:11:27,816
<I> took place in the Senegal 
river valley and delta. </ I>

129
00:11:28,016 --> 00:11:31,754
<I> These changes can be detected
through the variations, </ i>

130
00:11:31,954 --> 00:11:34,961
<I> increases or decreases 
of the surfaces </ i>

131
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:39,504
<I> the different types
of occupancy, land use </ i>

132
00:11:39,704 --> 00:11:44,412
<I> that have been highlighted 
by the cartography of the area </ i>

133
00:11:44,612 --> 00:11:49,758
<I> between these two dates,
that is to say between 1984 and 2003. </ I>

134
00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:54,840
<I> Let's take the example of the mangrove.
It is a sparse mangrove formation </ i>

135
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,849
<I> that has gradually
deteriorated over time. </ I>

136
00:11:59,061 --> 00:12:04,948
<I> And the mangrove has decreased
by 468 hectares between 1984 and 2003, </ i>

137
00:12:05,148 --> 00:12:10,339
<I> going from 1445 hectares
to 970 hectares </ i>

138
00:12:10,539 --> 00:12:12,964
<I> at the rate of at least
about 25 hectares per year. </ I>

139
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:16,489
<I> The irrigated crops have also,
considerably developed, </ i>

140
00:12:16,689 --> 00:12:19,801
<I> the greater availability
of water induced </ i>

141
00:12:20,001 --> 00:12:23,001
<I>by the Diama and Manantali dams. </ I>

142
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:28,656
<I> And its extension was
mainly done at the expense </ i>

143
00:12:28,856 --> 00:12:34,351
<I> of natural vegetal formations
in the floodplain, </ i>

144
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:38,758
<I> that is to say the shrub steppe
and what we can call</ i>

145
00:12:38,958 --> 00:12:41,490
<I> the relic forests. </ I>

146
00:12:41,703 --> 00:12:50,715
<I>Globally, we can say that
the water and the types of land use </ i>

147
00:12:50,915 --> 00:12:53,682
<I> related to its presence,
aquatic vegetation, </ i>

148
00:12:53,882 --> 00:12:58,245
<I> irrigated crops, bare 
easily flooded soil, have increased </ i>

149
00:12:58,445 --> 00:13:02,410
<I> whilst the terms such
as the natural vegetal formations </ i>

150
00:13:02,610 --> 00:13:04,828
<I> that are more exposed
to entropic actions </ i>

151
00:13:05,028 --> 00:13:08,776
<I> have substantially decreased. </ I>

152
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:12,891
<I> In terms of the spatial dynamic </ i>

153
00:13:13,091 --> 00:13:17,445
<I> of land use between 
those two dates, </ i>

154
00:13:17,645 --> 00:13:23,284
<I> we must take into account</ i>

155
00:13:23,484 --> 00:13:29,763
<I> the contrast between
the Diéri and Walo land. </ I>

156
00:13:29,963 --> 00:13:36,572
<I> The Diéri is a toucouleur geographical
term </ i>

157
00:13:36,952 --> 00:13:40,852
<I> which means non flooded 
areas of the valley </ i>

158
00:13:41,089 --> 00:13:47,261
<I> and the Walo means the
land cultivated </ i>

159
00:13:47,623 --> 00:13:51,323
<I> in the area flooded by the annual 
rains of the river. </ I>

160
00:13:51,523 --> 00:13:54,523
<I> So it is very important
to take this opposition </ i>

161
00:13:54,723 --> 00:14:00,785
<I> into account when, </ i>

162
00:14:00,985 --> 00:14:03,700
<I> the spatial dynamic is done. </ I>

163
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:06,900
<I> It is important
to take this contrast into account </ i>

164
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:12,719
<I> since the dry crop 
areas are generally </ i>

165
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:19,940
<I> most threatened because
they totally depend on rainfall. </ I>

166
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:36,001
We have just presented 
the objectives of the case study,

167
00:14:36,201 --> 00:14:39,946
the methodology and the results.

168
00:14:40,171 --> 00:14:44,352
What we can remember is that in total,

169
00:14:44,552 --> 00:14:48,151
the study area consists of 
different ecosystems

170
00:14:48,351 --> 00:14:52,587
providing a habitat for hundreds 
of animal and vegetal species,

171
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:58,740
so a very valuable biological 
diversity for a zone

172
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:02,340
which is located next to the desert.

173
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:05,540
But natural resources have evolved
under the combined effects

174
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:10,113
of several processes where

175
00:15:10,313 --> 00:15:15,975
entropic actions and physical 
factors are questioned.

176
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:18,837
And the analysis of production 
systems revealed

177
00:15:19,037 --> 00:15:21,983
a contrast between the Diéri 
and the Walo

178
00:15:22,183 --> 00:15:25,704
but especially a complementarity between
the scenes of agricultural production,

179
00:15:25,904 --> 00:15:28,904
I will quote the agricultural surplus,

180
00:15:29,104 --> 00:15:30,843
the irrigated agriculture 
and livestock.

181
00:15:31,043 --> 00:15:34,640
The multidate cartography
in the 200 thousandth

182
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:38,315
highlighted the major changes resulting

183
00:15:38,527 --> 00:15:44,960
on one hand from the vegetal potential
that has been hit hard

184
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,785
between 1984 and 2003 and 
on the other hand

185
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,630
from the relaxation of the water 
resources mobilization constraint.
