1
00:00:06,737 --> 00:00:09,337
50 years ago, there were
more than 100,000 black rhinoceros

2
00:00:09,537 --> 00:00:10,574
in Africa.

3
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:13,474
Today, 96% of the population
has disappeared

4
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:15,399
because of illegal poaching.

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:17,224
To protect the survivors,

6
00:00:17,437 --> 00:00:19,449
rangers must anticipate and know

7
00:00:19,649 --> 00:00:21,299
their location constantly.

8
00:00:21,524 --> 00:00:24,874
They use ultra-light drones
equipped with cameras

9
00:00:25,074 --> 00:00:26,812
that ply the nature reserves.

10
00:00:27,012 --> 00:00:29,462
High-resolution images are georeferenced,

11
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:31,575
rhinoceros are detected and
their positions

12
00:00:31,774 --> 00:00:34,675
are stored in a geographic
information system.

13
00:00:34,875 --> 00:00:38,175
This makes it possible to represent
animals on geographical maps

14
00:00:38,375 --> 00:00:40,287
and to organize the monitoring
of these areas.

15
00:00:48,324 --> 00:00:51,512
The introductory course of Geographic
Information System (GIS)

16
00:00:51,712 --> 00:00:53,117
will teach you to master

17
00:00:53,317 --> 00:00:56,230
the different phases of
the cycle of geo-information,

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,992
from the acquisition to the representation
through the storage and the analysis.

19
00:01:01,492 --> 00:01:04,355
Geodata, generally the values ​​
of a variable

20
00:01:04,555 --> 00:01:08,030
such as altitude, temperature
or soil moisture

21
00:01:08,242 --> 00:01:10,792
can be acquired through various methods

22
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:13,504
such as satellite or airbone

23
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:16,454
with airplanes, helicopters or drones,

24
00:01:16,642 --> 00:01:18,717
or simply by land measures.

25
00:01:18,917 --> 00:01:22,254
These raw geodata are interpreted
to identify

26
00:01:22,454 --> 00:01:23,617
geographic objects

27
00:01:23,804 --> 00:01:26,104
such as buildings, roads or plots of land

28
00:01:26,304 --> 00:01:28,592
which are then associated to properties

29
00:01:28,792 --> 00:01:31,542
such as name, use or surface.

30
00:01:31,767 --> 00:01:33,304
To facilitate its use,

31
00:01:33,517 --> 00:01:36,742
geographic information is
stored in databases.

32
00:01:37,117 --> 00:01:39,592
The hosting of these
different kinds of data

33
00:01:39,792 --> 00:01:43,017
imposes a structure and
a rigorous organization

34
00:01:43,217 --> 00:01:44,992
which can become complex.

35
00:01:45,192 --> 00:01:46,567
Thanks to these databases,

36
00:01:46,767 --> 00:01:49,579
geographic information system softwares

37
00:01:49,779 --> 00:01:52,517
access information effectively.

38
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:57,429
The manipulation of geodata is
facilitated by integrated tools

39
00:01:57,629 --> 00:02:01,117
that allow the analysis of
landscape features, for example,

40
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:03,942
which are not easy to
apprehend on the field.

41
00:02:04,142 --> 00:02:06,254
Other algorithms make available

42
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:09,504
spatial analysis functions
whose role is to highlight

43
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:12,217
recognizable structures on the territory 

44
00:02:12,417 --> 00:02:17,179
capable of revealing relations between
the analyzed geographical objects

45
00:02:17,429 --> 00:02:19,629
and climatic parameters for example.

46
00:02:19,929 --> 00:02:21,979
Finally, you will learn how

47
00:02:22,179 --> 00:02:24,254
GIS systems allow

48
00:02:24,454 --> 00:02:27,192
to represent the properties
of analyzed objects.

49
00:02:27,492 --> 00:02:31,267
By following this introductory course
on Geographic Information Systems

50
00:02:31,467 --> 00:02:35,904
you will learn to produce
quality cartographic documents

51
00:02:36,104 --> 00:02:39,529
and you will discover methods
of advanced representation

52
00:02:39,729 --> 00:02:41,804
in 3 and 4 dimensions.

53
00:02:42,617 --> 00:02:45,492
