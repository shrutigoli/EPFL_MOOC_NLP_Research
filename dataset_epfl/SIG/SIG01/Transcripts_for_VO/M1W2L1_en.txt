00:00:24,392 --> 00:00:26,276
Welcome to this introduction course

2
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:27,199
on QGIS

3
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:29,549
QGIS is a free software

4
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:31,537
downladable for free on internet

5
00:00:31,737 --> 00:00:33,965
that we will use
throughout this MOOC.

6
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:37,264
As you have noticed,

7
00:00:37,464 --> 00:00:38,214
this MOOC includes

8
00:00:38,414 --> 00:00:40,140
a number of special lessons

9
00:00:40,384 --> 00:00:41,668
excluding the table of contents,

10
00:00:41,868 --> 00:00:44,169
lessons that are either about QGIS,

11
00:00:44,369 --> 00:00:47,394
the GIS software that we will
use throughout the course,

12
00:00:47,704 --> 00:00:49,334
or about case studies

13
00:00:49,534 --> 00:00:50,792
which illustrate

14
00:00:50,992 --> 00:00:52,403
some aspects presented

15
00:00:52,603 --> 00:00:54,348
as part of the theoretical course.

16
00:00:54,548 --> 00:00:56,143
The first of these special lessons

17
00:00:56,343 --> 00:00:59,640
is an introduction
to the use of the QGIS software

18
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,826
and aims to become familiar

19
00:01:02,026 --> 00:01:03,635
with the most basic foundations

20
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:05,348
of this software.

21
00:01:05,924 --> 00:01:06,915
at the end of the lesson,

22
00:01:07,115 --> 00:01:08,384
you should be able to

23
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:10,331
to manage a QGIS project,

24
00:01:10,531 --> 00:01:12,959
import and export data,

25
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,057
manipulate the projection system,

26
00:01:16,257 --> 00:01:17,208
the symbology

27
00:01:17,408 --> 00:01:19,909
and the card manufacturing process.

28
00:01:20,293 --> 00:01:21,056
In this lesson,

29
00:01:21,256 --> 00:01:22,925
we will address successively

30
00:01:23,125 --> 00:01:25,000
the elements of the interface,

31
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:28,511
the management of projection systems,

32
00:01:29,786 --> 00:01:31,448
the data management aspects,

33
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,147
the symbology

34
00:01:33,347 --> 00:01:35,463
and finally, card printing.

35
00:01:40,595 --> 00:01:42,073
Here is the QGIS interface

36
00:01:42,273 --> 00:01:44,084
in which a project about the island

37
00:01:44,284 --> 00:01:46,014
of Mahe in the Seychelles was opened.

38
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,628
This interface

39
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:49,102
includes a map area,

40
00:01:49,302 --> 00:01:51,219
a menu area,

41
00:01:51,951 --> 00:01:54,627
an area with toolbars,

42
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:57,309
a number of side panels

43
00:01:57,777 --> 00:01:59,082
and a footer.

44
00:02:00,621 --> 00:02:02,649
The mouse allows you to manipulate

45
00:02:02,874 --> 00:02:03,839
the map directly

46
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:05,555
by moving it to the left and to the right

47
00:02:05,755 --> 00:02:06,821
and with the wheel,

48
00:02:07,255 --> 00:02:09,124
to activate the zoom function.

49
00:02:09,906 --> 00:02:12,100
The information is structured
into projects

50
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:15,127
which are accessible through
the appropriate menu,

51
00:02:15,327 --> 00:02:17,615
so we can re-open a recent project,

52
00:02:17,815 --> 00:02:19,147
which is what I did earlier

53
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,465
to load the project we have before us,

54
00:02:21,665 --> 00:02:23,528
and we find these same features 

55
00:02:23,728 --> 00:02:26,567
in the corresponding toolbar,

56
00:02:26,767 --> 00:02:27,707
this toolbar

57
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,041
can be detached

58
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,639
and reinserted

59
00:02:30,839 --> 00:02:31,707
in the interface,

60
00:02:31,907 --> 00:02:34,110
same thing for the side panels,

61
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:35,891
here the layer management panel

62
00:02:36,116 --> 00:02:37,942
which allows to mask or display

63
00:02:38,142 --> 00:02:39,203
the different layers

64
00:02:40,651 --> 00:02:42,816
and to manage their superposition,

65
00:02:43,016 --> 00:02:45,234
the layer of districts is moved here

66
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:46,532
above the others

67
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:48,007
and we lose it on the way.

68
00:02:48,609 --> 00:02:49,496
Here it is again.

69
00:02:50,182 --> 00:02:51,897
And so like the toolbars,

70
00:02:52,097 --> 00:02:53,023
these side panels

71
00:02:53,235 --> 00:02:54,562
can be unhooked

72
00:02:54,762 --> 00:02:56,989
and put back in their place
in the interface.

73
00:02:58,504 --> 00:02:59,695
The "view" menu

74
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:00,886
allows to manage

75
00:03:01,086 --> 00:03:03,738
the display of the various side panels

76
00:03:03,938 --> 00:03:05,028
or toolbars.

77
00:03:05,228 --> 00:03:07,057
Here we activate

78
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:10,517
the toolbar called "map navigator",

79
00:03:10,717 --> 00:03:13,566
which provides a number of tools

80
00:03:13,766 --> 00:03:16,540
intended to facilitate navigation,

81
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:17,739
here a zoom tool

82
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:19,509
which allows you to select a sector

83
00:03:19,696 --> 00:03:21,508
and zoom in on that sector.

84
00:03:22,104 --> 00:03:22,893
The reverse tool,

85
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:24,064
of unzooming,

86
00:03:24,264 --> 00:03:26,015
is the navigation tool

87
00:03:26,215 --> 00:03:28,349
between the different successive zooms.

88
00:03:30,162 --> 00:03:32,200
The QGIS basic functionalities

89
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,525
can be enhanced by extensions

90
00:03:34,725 --> 00:03:36,453
that are very numerous.

91
00:03:40,623 --> 00:03:42,357
An example of these extensions

92
00:03:42,557 --> 00:03:44,194
is the Open Layers plugin

93
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:45,834
that allows to add

94
00:03:46,034 --> 00:03:48,654
maps from the virtual globes,

95
00:03:48,854 --> 00:03:50,521
here the Open Street Map

96
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:52,850
for the island of Mahe in the Seychelles.

97
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:54,457
The footer

98
00:03:54,669 --> 00:03:55,877
includes the display tool

99
00:03:56,077 --> 00:03:57,520
of the mouse coordinates

100
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,962
or the grip of the map,

101
00:03:59,804 --> 00:04:01,218
the management of the scale,

102
00:04:01,418 --> 00:04:03,194
if we go to 50'000

103
00:04:03,394 --> 00:04:05,706
then back to a scale of 250'000,

104
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:09,823
the possibility to change
the orientation of the map

105
00:04:10,563 --> 00:04:13,093
and finally a zone

106
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:18,910
in which the possible messages 
of the software are displayed.

107
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,664
We will see in the second lesson
of this course

108
00:04:30,864 --> 00:04:31,798
that the various objects

109
00:04:32,011 --> 00:04:33,091
which we wish to integrate

110
00:04:33,304 --> 00:04:34,865
to a geographic information system

111
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:36,221
must be positioned

112
00:04:36,421 --> 00:04:37,400
on the surface of the globe,

113
00:04:37,670 --> 00:04:39,711
which can be done with 
their longitude latitude 

114
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:40,781
coordinates,

115
00:04:41,034 --> 00:04:43,048
or when the surface is projected

116
00:04:43,248 --> 00:04:45,221
in a cartographic space-map

117
00:04:45,535 --> 00:04:47,035
by their coordinates x y.

118
00:04:48,002 --> 00:04:49,682
Geographical information systems

119
00:04:49,907 --> 00:04:50,896
must therefore

120
00:04:51,096 --> 00:04:53,447
allow to define and manipulate

121
00:04:53,647 --> 00:04:55,124
the projection system

122
00:04:55,324 --> 00:04:56,789
attached to a data set.

123
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:58,816
We will now see

124
00:04:59,016 --> 00:04:59,935
how these elements

125
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:02,555
are organized in the QGIS software.

126
00:05:04,978 --> 00:05:06,751
By right-clicking on a data layer,

127
00:05:06,951 --> 00:05:07,788
you can access

128
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:09,621
the properties of the layer

129
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:11,102
and among these properties,

130
00:05:11,302 --> 00:05:12,380
under the general tab,

131
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,259
we will find the projection system used,

132
00:05:15,459 --> 00:05:17,876
here UTM 40 South.

133
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:22,647
When the projection system is
not yet defined,

134
00:05:22,847 --> 00:05:26,534
it is possible to use
the definition function

135
00:05:26,734 --> 00:05:30,165
which offers a wide
choice of projection systems,

136
00:05:30,365 --> 00:05:33,045
which allows to filter them by name

137
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:35,738
or by EPSG code,

138
00:05:35,938 --> 00:05:37,905
the meaning of which we will see

139
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:38,879
in lesson 2.

140
00:05:40,491 --> 00:05:41,851
We see here that the map

141
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,650
has the same projection system

142
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:45,070
as the hotel layer,

143
00:05:45,816 --> 00:05:47,941
the projection of the map can be modified

144
00:05:48,141 --> 00:05:49,765
by activating the on-the-fly projection,

145
00:05:49,965 --> 00:05:52,033
which means that the different layers

146
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,431
will be corrected

147
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:56,660
to adapt to the projection
system of the card.

148
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:58,441
Here we have selected

149
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:01,084
the WGS84 projection system,

150
00:06:01,284 --> 00:06:02,454
so latitude, longitude,

151
00:06:02,654 --> 00:06:03,805
and we see that indeed,

152
00:06:04,005 --> 00:06:06,727
the coordinates are displayed
in latitude and longitude.

153
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:09,608
It is also possible

154
00:06:11,145 --> 00:06:12,147
to save a copy

155
00:06:12,347 --> 00:06:13,343
of a data layer

156
00:06:13,543 --> 00:06:15,732
in a different format

157
00:06:15,932 --> 00:06:18,279
and with a different projection system.

158
00:06:18,702 --> 00:06:19,748
we could for example,

159
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:23,629
convert the coordinates UTM 40 South

160
00:06:23,829 --> 00:06:25,410
in latitude longitude.

161
00:06:37,725 --> 00:06:38,825
The addition of layers

162
00:06:39,025 --> 00:06:41,178
is done through the "layer" menu.

163
00:06:41,378 --> 00:06:42,762
We can create a new layer

164
00:06:42,962 --> 00:06:45,476
of shapefile or SpatiaLite type
of different formats,

165
00:06:45,665 --> 00:06:47,546
or add existing data,

166
00:06:47,746 --> 00:06:48,937
here a vector layer

167
00:06:49,137 --> 00:06:51,858
that we will look in the file tree,

168
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:55,630
we choose here the layer
of the buildings of the island of Mahé.

169
00:06:56,547 --> 00:06:59,239
It is necessary to specify
the projection system used,

170
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:01,424
here again UTM 40 South

171
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:05,241
and we can then use the zoom
navigation tool

172
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:07,538
to zoom in on the center of Victoria,

173
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:08,418
the capital.

174
00:07:09,389 --> 00:07:11,658
A right click in the toolbar area

175
00:07:11,858 --> 00:07:13,497
allows to add the toolbar

176
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:15,746
which offers the same functionality

177
00:07:15,946 --> 00:07:17,810
of adding layers of vector type,

178
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,888
raster type, etc.

179
00:07:20,678 --> 00:07:22,542
Another right click in the toolbars

180
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,471
allows you to add the navigation side panel

181
00:07:25,671 --> 00:07:28,258
that gives access to the file tree

182
00:07:29,196 --> 00:07:30,049
and there we can enter,

183
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:31,448
drag and drop

184
00:07:31,648 --> 00:07:32,651
one of these files,

185
00:07:32,851 --> 00:07:33,932
here the contour lines.

186
00:07:34,145 --> 00:07:35,080
It is necessary again

187
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,833
to define its projection system,

188
00:07:38,033 --> 00:07:40,022
again UTM 40 South,

189
00:07:40,637 --> 00:07:42,575
so that this layer appears

190
00:07:42,775 --> 00:07:44,171
in the map area.

191
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:47,339
A right click on a layer

192
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:50,174
provides access to the attribute table

193
00:07:50,374 --> 00:07:51,267
associated with it.

194
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:52,891
Here in the hotels,

195
00:07:53,091 --> 00:07:55,147
we see that we have recorded the names,

196
00:07:55,347 --> 00:07:56,990
the number of rooms, the number of beds,

197
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,109
the status, an identifier,

198
00:07:59,309 --> 00:08:00,338
things like that.

199
00:08:02,475 --> 00:08:03,527
Still with a right click,

200
00:08:03,727 --> 00:08:05,908
we see that we can, as we saw earlier,

201
00:08:06,108 --> 00:08:08,395
save a file

202
00:08:08,595 --> 00:08:10,497
or a data layer in another format,

203
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:13,799
with here a great richness of
possible formats

204
00:08:13,999 --> 00:08:16,672
and also by modifying
its projection system.

205
00:08:29,143 --> 00:08:31,392
The symbology is
the set of parameters

206
00:08:31,592 --> 00:08:33,983
which defines the graphic
appearance of a layer.

207
00:08:34,482 --> 00:08:36,025
It is accessible in QGIS

208
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:37,418
by a right click

209
00:08:37,618 --> 00:08:42,744
on the layer and the "layer
properties" heading.

210
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:44,886
Under the "style" tab,

211
00:08:45,073 --> 00:08:46,404
we find the different elements

212
00:08:46,604 --> 00:08:49,860
which in fact define
the appearance of this layer,

213
00:08:50,686 --> 00:08:52,566
starting with the filling

214
00:08:52,766 --> 00:08:55,048
with its color,

215
00:08:55,248 --> 00:08:57,547
the color of the border,

216
00:08:57,747 --> 00:08:59,024
the style of filling,

217
00:08:59,224 --> 00:09:01,604
here diagonal bars.

218
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,703
The filling may be simple

219
00:09:04,903 --> 00:09:06,201
or more complex,

220
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:10,500
faded or in a pattern

221
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,742
with lines,

222
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:15,052
and in this case we can adjust the angle

223
00:09:15,252 --> 00:09:16,833
with which the lines are drawn,

224
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:18,804
the spacing of the different lines,

225
00:09:19,004 --> 00:09:20,344
their gap,

226
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:22,538
a whole bunch of parameters

227
00:09:22,738 --> 00:09:25,452
which enable to refine
considerably

228
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,710
the filling shape

229
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,649
of our layer.

230
00:09:31,731 --> 00:09:32,908
The unique symbol

231
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,750
can also be replaced

232
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:36,118
by a scale of values

233
00:09:36,318 --> 00:09:38,777
when we have a variety of parameters.

234
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:41,052
If we take here the names of
the districts

235
00:09:41,252 --> 00:09:43,473
and we associate a scale of colors 
that goes from blue to green


236
00:09:43,673 --> 00:09:47,642
with this scale of names,

237
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:50,647
a classification in alphabetic order

238
00:09:52,387 --> 00:09:54,856
which in fact gives the lightest colors

239
00:09:55,056 --> 00:09:58,626
to the first district in
alphabetical order.

240
00:09:59,501 --> 00:10:01,051
Another form of representation,

241
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:02,688
the graduated representation,

242
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:05,949
where the elements are no longer
classified in categories

243
00:10:06,149 --> 00:10:09,659
but with a continuous scale of values.

244
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:12,252
It is possible to add labels

245
00:10:12,452 --> 00:10:14,656
by choosing the attribute table field

246
00:10:14,856 --> 00:10:16,481
which will be used for the label,

247
00:10:17,111 --> 00:10:20,744
the font with which these
labels will be displayed,

248
00:10:20,944 --> 00:10:23,571
their size, possibly the color.

249
00:10:27,027 --> 00:10:29,778
And we see here what it looks 
like on the map

250
00:10:29,978 --> 00:10:32,646
with districts

251
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:35,415
colored in alphabetical order

252
00:10:35,615 --> 00:10:37,886
and light yellow labels.

253
00:10:38,994 --> 00:10:43,573
The symbology properties

254
00:10:43,773 --> 00:10:45,744
can be saved,

255
00:10:46,816 --> 00:10:48,193
they can be registered

256
00:10:48,393 --> 00:10:52,420
as part of QGIS
in the form of a style file,

257
00:10:53,689 --> 00:10:55,770
and it is possible to reload them later

258
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:58,581
here we find the style file

259
00:10:58,781 --> 00:11:00,941
that we had at the beginning
of the exercise.

260
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,549
The creation of a paper map

261
00:11:14,749 --> 00:11:16,968
is ultimately one of the
important functions

262
00:11:17,168 --> 00:11:19,385
of a geographical information system.

263
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:20,788
In QGIS,

264
00:11:20,988 --> 00:11:23,203
It goes through a printing dialer,

265
00:11:23,403 --> 00:11:25,104
accessible under the "project" menu

266
00:11:25,304 --> 00:11:27,680
and which gives access to a new window

267
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:30,406
in which it is possible
to build a map

268
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:33,795
by first adding a map element

269
00:11:33,995 --> 00:11:35,407
that can be configured

270
00:11:35,607 --> 00:11:37,479
by defining its scale,

271
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:41,216
or the hold,

272
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:43,073
so the area covered by the map,

273
00:11:43,743 --> 00:11:45,952
we can add a label,

274
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:46,857
a title.

275
00:11:48,454 --> 00:11:50,599
Here we will call this map

276
00:11:51,851 --> 00:11:53,115
Mahé - Seychelles.

277
00:11:54,637 --> 00:11:56,984
This title can also be configured

278
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,814
by modifying the type of font used,

279
00:12:01,014 --> 00:12:03,087
the size of this font,

280
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:06,893
by changing the centering of the title

281
00:12:07,093 --> 00:12:08,532
to put it in the middle of the page.

282
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:12,613
It is then possible to add a scale

283
00:12:13,707 --> 00:12:18,127
which allows to get a sense
of the distances,

284
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:21,122
by adjusting the settings of this scale,

285
00:12:21,322 --> 00:12:22,618
in particular its size,

286
00:12:22,818 --> 00:12:25,309
we can adjust its height,

287
00:12:25,509 --> 00:12:28,584
adjust the way the scale is represented,

288
00:12:28,784 --> 00:12:30,050
the number of graduations,

289
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:33,756
Here we decide to have
five graduations from zero.

290
00:12:34,523 --> 00:12:36,741
The symbology is used here,

291
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:39,638
a double box as opposed to a single box.

292
00:12:39,838 --> 00:12:43,130
To manage the color of the writings,

293
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,394
here the values ​​are yellow again.

294
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:50,139
To this we can add a legend

295
00:12:51,113 --> 00:12:55,863
which we place here in the upper
right corner

296
00:12:56,063 --> 00:12:56,836
of the map.

297
00:12:57,422 --> 00:12:59,240
The automatic update is disabled

298
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,806
and we actually remove
all the contents of the legend

299
00:13:02,006 --> 00:13:04,715
to be able to choose
what we want to show

300
00:13:04,915 --> 00:13:05,918
here what interests us,

301
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,985
is to have only the three layers

302
00:13:08,185 --> 00:13:09,632
represented on the map,

303
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,121
so hotels, roads

304
00:13:11,321 --> 00:13:12,404
and districts.

305
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:16,669
This legend can also be configured

306
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:18,202
a little in all the settings,

307
00:13:18,402 --> 00:13:19,536
the font size,

308
00:13:19,736 --> 00:13:20,895
including the title,

309
00:13:21,095 --> 00:13:24,009
here we take a smaller size ,11,

310
00:13:24,209 --> 00:13:25,461
and then the font size

311
00:13:25,686 --> 00:13:27,340
legend elements,

312
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,485
so objects,

313
00:13:28,685 --> 00:13:30,449
here we take a size 9.

314
00:13:32,385 --> 00:13:35,167
The format, the size of the legend area

315
00:13:35,367 --> 00:13:36,793
can also be adjusted,

316
00:13:36,993 --> 00:13:39,093
as well as the transparency of the background.

317
00:13:39,293 --> 00:13:41,224
at the rendering level.

318
00:13:41,424 --> 00:13:44,519
Here it was the map that was active.

319
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,885
If we activate the legend,

320
00:13:47,085 --> 00:13:48,495
we modify its transparency

321
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:51,662
to melt it a little in the decor.

322
00:13:51,862 --> 00:13:53,191
Finally, all these settings

323
00:13:53,391 --> 00:13:55,743
allow to nicely build a map

324
00:13:55,943 --> 00:13:58,750
which will actually be stored

325
00:13:58,950 --> 00:14:01,944
in the composition manager

326
00:14:02,668 --> 00:14:04,362
to be reactivated,

327
00:14:04,562 --> 00:14:06,889
duplicated or deleted.

328
00:14:17,091 --> 00:14:18,129
We have seen

329
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:19,964
in this first lesson

330
00:14:20,164 --> 00:14:21,791
of introduction to QGIS

331
00:14:22,555 --> 00:14:24,448
some of the basic foundations

332
00:14:24,648 --> 00:14:25,910
of the use of this software,

333
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,554
in particular

334
00:14:27,754 --> 00:14:31,019
how to import/export data,

335
00:14:31,219 --> 00:14:34,626
how to manage their projection system,

336
00:14:34,826 --> 00:14:37,333
how to change their appearance

337
00:14:37,554 --> 00:14:40,804
by accessing the settings
that manage their symbology

338
00:14:41,004 --> 00:14:41,653
and finally;

339
00:14:41,853 --> 00:14:43,216
how to compose maps

340
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:44,670
to integrate them

341
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:46,773
in reports or other documents.
