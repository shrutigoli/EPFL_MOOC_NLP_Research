Hello and welcome to this MOOC

3
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:27,150
dedicated to geographic
information systems.

4
00:00:27,675 --> 00:00:29,230
As you can see,

5
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,524
this MOOC consist of 2 parts

6
00:00:31,794 --> 00:00:34,327
and is structured around 4 modules.

7
00:00:34,683 --> 00:00:38,197
These modules are dedicated
respectively to digitization,

8
00:00:38,377 --> 00:00:40,246
storage, analysis

9
00:00:40,447 --> 00:00:43,815
and representation of
the geographical space.

10
00:00:44,444 --> 00:00:46,835
This first module dedicated 
to digitization

11
00:00:47,013 --> 00:00:49,919
is subdivided into a first series
of 5 lessons

12
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:52,225
which will allow us to
tackle successively

13
00:00:52,484 --> 00:00:53,984
the various fundamental aspects

14
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:56,345
of the transformation of a spatial reality

15
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:58,822
to a set of property objects

16
00:00:59,164 --> 00:01:00,533
capable of being digitized

17
00:01:00,733 --> 00:01:02,558
then saved in a database.

18
00:01:03,992 --> 00:01:07,046
We will then speak successively
of modeling of the territory,

19
00:01:07,398 --> 00:01:09,612
of coordinates and projection systems,

20
00:01:09,801 --> 00:01:11,962
of spatial relations and topologies,

21
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:15,229
of vector modes and images, and metadata.

22
00:01:15,603 --> 00:01:18,930
In the second part of this module,
we will talk more specifically

23
00:01:19,172 --> 00:01:21,394
of data acquisition techniques.

24
00:01:22,897 --> 00:01:26,284
Describing the geographical reality
simply by drawing a map

25
00:01:26,454 --> 00:01:30,194
or by conceptualizing it in terms
of objects and properties

26
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:34,718
necessarily implies a process 
of modeling in both cases.

27
00:01:35,623 --> 00:01:38,041
These are the fundamental
elements of this process

28
00:01:38,222 --> 00:01:40,904
which we will discuss 
in this first lesson.

29
00:01:42,073 --> 00:01:43,444
The aim of this lesson

30
00:01:43,622 --> 00:01:45,857
is to understand the
most basic aspects

31
00:01:46,037 --> 00:01:47,861
of the modeling of the territory,

32
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:51,294
to understand that this modeling
is an indispensable

33
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:53,831
preliminary step for any form
of analysis

34
00:01:53,994 --> 00:01:56,548
or representation of
geographical space.

35
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:59,568
At the end of this lesson, 
you will be able to

36
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,458
explain the principles of
the modeling of the territory

37
00:02:03,979 --> 00:02:07,882
and to describe the forms and
contents on which it can rely on.

38
00:02:09,386 --> 00:02:11,724
In this lesson we will
discuss successively

39
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:14,716
the notions of geographical
area and territory,

40
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:18,278
we will discuss the
principles of modeling

41
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:21,079
before addressing the cartography aspects

42
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:25,019
which are the first form
of modeling of the territory

43
00:02:25,742 --> 00:02:29,517
to finally end with the discrete
and continuous phenomena

44
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:32,555
which characterize geographical area.

45
00:02:33,348 --> 00:02:40,653
[LOUD MUSIC]

46
00:02:41,198 --> 00:02:44,011
The geographical area can be
considered at first glance

47
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:47,637
as being composed of its natural
physical components:

48
00:02:47,972 --> 00:02:51,581
the mountains, the lake or the forests

49
00:02:51,977 --> 00:02:53,912
to which anthropised areas such as,

50
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:57,270
for example, built-up areas

51
00:02:57,432 --> 00:03:00,432
or transport infrastructures,
here a highway, must be added.

52
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,412
As soon as we speak of
anthropized areas,

53
00:03:03,587 --> 00:03:06,414
this implies that the concept
of geographical space

54
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:08,204
also includes

55
00:03:08,379 --> 00:03:11,179
all the dimensions related
to the human geography

56
00:03:11,431 --> 00:03:16,285
as well as all the elements related
to how the companies function.

57
00:03:17,389 --> 00:03:19,942
It is clear that the geographical space

58
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:24,720
extends well beyond its
simple sensitive physical reality.

59
00:03:26,457 --> 00:03:29,182
Many formal definitions of the notion

60
00:03:29,348 --> 00:03:31,618
of geographical spaces
have been proposed,

61
00:03:31,988 --> 00:03:33,780
such as those of Brunet

62
00:03:33,957 --> 00:03:37,296
who says that geographical space is
defined as the terrestrial extent

63
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:39,924
used and managed by societies

64
00:03:40,146 --> 00:03:42,328
with the intention to reproduce
in the broad sense,

65
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:44,845
not only for food and shelter

66
00:03:45,111 --> 00:03:47,589
but in all the complexity
of social actions.

67
00:03:48,392 --> 00:03:51,058
It includes all the places
and their relations.

68
00:03:51,232 --> 00:03:54,934
It is thus both a system of relations
and an organized product

69
00:03:55,162 --> 00:03:58,162
Resulting from the interactions
between nature and societies.

70
00:03:59,044 --> 00:04:01,034
it has laws and rules of organization

71
00:04:01,222 --> 00:04:03,259
and universal differentiation

72
00:04:03,436 --> 00:04:05,786
but expressed differently
depending on the systems.

73
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:08,402
In the first rank is gravitation

74
00:04:08,577 --> 00:04:10,984
and more generally all
the effects of distance,

75
00:04:11,154 --> 00:04:13,484
aggregation and spacing.

76
00:04:13,792 --> 00:04:16,368
There are five basic uses:

77
00:04:16,585 --> 00:04:19,604
Appropriation, exploitation
or promotion,

78
00:04:19,782 --> 00:04:24,150
housing, exchange or
communication and management.

79
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:28,179
The notion of territory which
was also the subject of

80
00:04:28,347 --> 00:04:30,692
many discussions and definitions

81
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,414
can be considered simply

82
00:04:32,603 --> 00:04:35,326
as a delimited part of
the geographical space.

83
00:04:37,329 --> 00:04:40,023
This delimitation can be
based on a boundary

84
00:04:40,276 --> 00:04:42,815
in the case of political-administrative
subdivisions,

85
00:04:43,065 --> 00:04:46,879
as the canton of Vaud here and
the councils which compose it.

86
00:04:47,365 --> 00:04:50,081
It can also be based on natural limits

87
00:04:50,327 --> 00:04:52,626
such as forest edges,

88
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:55,425
watercourses or

89
00:04:55,597 --> 00:04:57,638
isolated objects such as trees.

90
00:04:58,274 --> 00:05:06,940
[LOUD MUSIC]

91
00:05:07,217 --> 00:05:09,008
The modeling of the territory

92
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:12,490
is the process by which
the transition from

93
00:05:12,676 --> 00:05:15,025
a visible geographical reality

94
00:05:15,234 --> 00:05:19,117
to a diagrammatic representation
is done like a north-south facing map 

95
00:05:19,292 --> 00:05:22,631
on which only what we
want appears.

96
00:05:23,728 --> 00:05:25,739
Due to the complexity of the territory,

97
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:28,412
its modeling gives a simplified

98
00:05:28,587 --> 00:05:31,383
generalized, schematized representation

99
00:05:31,556 --> 00:05:35,108
so that we can speak of
controlled reduction of reality.

100
00:05:36,596 --> 00:05:37,829
As we have just seen,

101
00:05:37,997 --> 00:05:41,558
this schematization leads to go
from a three-dimensional vision

102
00:05:41,899 --> 00:05:44,378
to a 2-dimensional orthogonal view

103
00:05:44,567 --> 00:05:48,042
from which we extract the elements
worthy of being represented.

104
00:05:48,674 --> 00:05:51,575
This extraction is based
on a systemic analysis

105
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,283
which seeks to describe the reality

106
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,895
by its components and their interrelations,

107
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,345
as is the case here for the problematic

108
00:05:58,544 --> 00:06:01,456
of the management of the waters
of Lake Mariout near Alexandria.

109
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,492
It can be seen that the model
of the adopted territory

110
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,660
depends on the subject treated.

111
00:06:07,988 --> 00:06:10,432
We will not have the same
kind of modeling 

112
00:06:10,866 --> 00:06:14,073
or maps at all to deal with the
geology, the water management

113
00:06:14,252 --> 00:06:17,209
or to address the issue
of public transport.

114
00:06:18,595 --> 00:06:21,841
The model chosen also
depends on the description scale

115
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:24,116
because the same
objects are not selected

116
00:06:24,298 --> 00:06:27,336
with the same richness
of details at all scales.

117
00:06:28,946 --> 00:06:37,826
[LOUD MUSIC]

118
00:06:38,684 --> 00:06:40,873
The cartography was the first form

119
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:43,307
of modeling of the
geographic space

120
00:06:44,255 --> 00:06:45,702
with Eratosthenes' map

121
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:47,985
right from the third century BC,

122
00:06:49,038 --> 00:06:51,587
Al Idrissi's map in 1145

123
00:06:51,753 --> 00:06:54,176
Columbus' map in 1490,

124
00:06:54,442 --> 00:06:58,701
Cantino's map in 1507, and 
Mercator's map in 1569.

125
00:07:00,183 --> 00:07:02,569
Content and graphical semiology
depend, as we have seen,

126
00:07:02,747 --> 00:07:04,397
on the discipline and scale,

127
00:07:04,586 --> 00:07:06,050
so much so that the cartography 
has developed

128
00:07:06,221 --> 00:07:09,509
by becoming more precise
with a regular updating

129
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:12,439
on several scales

130
00:07:13,325 --> 00:07:15,586
and for a wide variety of themes.

131
00:07:17,204 --> 00:07:19,767
The main functions of cartography

132
00:07:19,943 --> 00:07:22,106
are the recognition of a place,

133
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:25,935
the spatial representation
of objects or classes of objects,

134
00:07:26,445 --> 00:07:28,843
the representation of
thematic inventories

135
00:07:29,018 --> 00:07:31,021
and their spatial distribution

136
00:07:31,285 --> 00:07:33,928
and the representation of
dynamic phenomena.

137
00:07:34,922 --> 00:07:43,750
[LOUD MUSIC]

138
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:48,406
We have talked about the
notion of modeling of the territory,

139
00:07:49,106 --> 00:07:50,971
but we must now look at

140
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:54,079
the possible contents
of these models.

141
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:58,772
We can therefore rely on the
fact that geographical space

142
00:07:59,111 --> 00:08:02,264
is perceived through spatial objects,

143
00:08:02,644 --> 00:08:05,317
of the distribution of spatial phenomena

144
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:07,463
and processes and their dynamics

145
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,544
in space as well as in time.

146
00:08:10,751 --> 00:08:14,501
A discrete spatial phenomenon is
circumscribed by its limitations.

147
00:08:14,788 --> 00:08:16,945
It consists of a collection of homogeneous

148
00:08:17,507 --> 00:08:19,120
objects in all their parts

149
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:22,419
and it is for this reason that we
will speak of object approach.

150
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:26,814
It is the case of building
areas, wooded areas,

151
00:08:26,989 --> 00:08:29,822
hedges, isolated trees, road network

152
00:08:31,148 --> 00:08:33,568
lakes and rivers and river basins

153
00:08:33,854 --> 00:08:36,776
or the location of dams.

154
00:08:37,897 --> 00:08:40,730
A continuous spatial phenomenon
is not circumscribed,

155
00:08:40,908 --> 00:08:43,160
its properties vary in space

156
00:08:43,329 --> 00:08:46,958
and it can be represented
by iso-value curves

157
00:08:47,224 --> 00:08:51,383
or in the form of a regular
image-like grid,

158
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:54,114
reason why we talk
about image approach.

159
00:08:55,091 --> 00:08:56,900
It is the case of the glacial maximum,

160
00:08:57,081 --> 00:08:59,534
of the slope distribution,

161
00:08:59,725 --> 00:09:01,783
of isostatic anomalies

162
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,911
or the depth of the soil.

163
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:14,846

00:09:15,789 --> 00:09:18,106
So we saw in this first lesson

165
00:09:18,418 --> 00:09:20,164
that the territory can be defined

166
00:09:20,352 --> 00:09:23,227
as a delimited part of
the geographical space,

167
00:09:23,627 --> 00:09:26,042
that its modeling is
based on a simplification

168
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:28,780
and schematization process

169
00:09:28,957 --> 00:09:31,648
which implies choosing what
we wants to represent,

170
00:09:32,027 --> 00:09:34,198
so that the model that is obtained

171
00:09:34,864 --> 00:09:36,875
depends on the area
in which we are located

172
00:09:37,038 --> 00:09:38,968
and the scale of description.

173
00:09:39,593 --> 00:09:41,819
And finally we saw that this model

174
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:45,329
tries to describe the
discrete phenomena

175
00:09:45,504 --> 00:09:46,878
in the form of objects

176
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:51,446
and the continuous phenomena in
the form of images or credits.

177
00:09:52,835 --> 00:10:01,212
