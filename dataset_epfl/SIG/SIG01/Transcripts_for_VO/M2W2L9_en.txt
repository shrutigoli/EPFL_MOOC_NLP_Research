1
00:00:24,387 --> 00:00:29,343
Welcome to this course which
is about a case study

2
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:34,225
in which we will present
the bushfires in Senegal.

3
00:00:35,175 --> 00:00:39,239
The purpose of the lesson is
to get you to understand

4
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:42,742
the role of information systems
in the management of bushfires

5
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:48,014
but also to be able to use them
in the monitoring of bushfires.

6
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:52,546
Concerning the plan of this lesson,
here is how it is declined. 

7
00:00:52,796 --> 00:00:55,955
First we will characterize the bushfires, 

8
00:00:56,155 --> 00:01:01,348
then decline the mission of the CSE 
and the public authorities 

9
00:01:01,548 --> 00:01:03,579
in Senegal and in the management
of bushfires. 

10
00:01:03,829 --> 00:01:08,024
Thirdly, we will talk about the role of 

11
00:01:08,224 --> 00:01:10,398
the geographic information system 

12
00:01:10,598 --> 00:01:12,882
and the methodology that was used 

13
00:01:13,082 --> 00:01:18,074
and finally, we will finish with the 
results and make some recommendations. 

14
00:01:21,874 --> 00:01:24,288
In this section, we will
talk about the causes 

15
00:01:24,488 --> 00:01:25,908
and the extension of the phenomenon. 

16
00:01:26,108 --> 00:01:30,256
First of all, we must know that
Senegal suffers every year 

17
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:32,096
from enormous damages from bushfires 

18
00:01:32,296 --> 00:01:36,566
estimated at hundreds of
millions of CFA francs. 

19
00:01:36,791 --> 00:01:40,154
As for the causes, there are 
2 we can remember. 

20
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:44,623
First, what is called slash-and-burn 
cultivation and clearing. 

21
00:01:44,823 --> 00:01:47,051
We have to say though that 
it is an ancestral part 

22
00:01:47,251 --> 00:01:49,880
of the itinerant 
slash-and-burn cultivation. 

23
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,080
Farmers have a tendency 
to expand their field 

24
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,075
or to seek new land to increase
their production 

25
00:01:58,275 --> 00:02:01,275
using fire as a means of clearing. 

26
00:02:01,475 --> 00:02:02,185
That is one cause. 

27
00:02:02,385 --> 00:02:04,633
A second cause 

28
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:08,844
is all this negligence around
early fires 

29
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:12,017
because these early fires, 
if they are done 

30
00:02:12,217 --> 00:02:16,244
according to the rules, 
constitute a way  

31
00:02:16,468 --> 00:02:21,691
of preventing late fires and
unfortunately, 

32
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:26,523
the respect by the populations
of the best conditions 

33
00:02:26,723 --> 00:02:29,032
for their implementation is 
sometimes left to be desired. 

34
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:33,838
As a result these fires which
were perceived as means 

35
00:02:34,038 --> 00:02:39,355
of limiting damages often become
real fires. 

36
00:02:39,555 --> 00:02:40,957
As far as the extension
is concerned, 

37
00:02:41,157 --> 00:02:46,813
this phenomenon covers the
entire Sudano-Sahelian zone, 

38
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:53,924
especially in the dry season, that is
to say between October and May, 

39
00:02:54,124 --> 00:02:58,444
the period that precedes 
the cultivation. 

40
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:03,730
As for the consequences,
we can list 

41
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:09,104
a certain number of them, 
4 or 5 consequences. 

42
00:03:09,304 --> 00:03:15,012
The first is the destruction
of the forest heritage. 

43
00:03:15,212 --> 00:03:20,627
Forest resources of Senegal
play an important role 

44
00:03:20,827 --> 00:03:24,464
in improving food security. 

45
00:03:24,664 --> 00:03:29,697
It is a very important source
of energy 

46
00:03:29,897 --> 00:03:32,633
for Senegalese households. 

47
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:38,302
Another consequence is
the loss of biological diversity. 

48
00:03:38,502 --> 00:03:43,788
The threat to people and
human establishments 

49
00:03:43,988 --> 00:03:46,688
is another, 

50
00:03:46,913 --> 00:03:50,188
global warming since
there is a production 

51
00:03:50,388 --> 00:03:53,388
of greenhouse gas, 
a reduction also 

52
00:03:53,588 --> 00:03:56,588
in sequestration capacities
of the atmospheric carbon 

53
00:03:56,788 --> 00:04:00,410
by destruction of the vegetation. 

54
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:04,271
A final and no less important consequence,

55
00:04:04,471 --> 00:04:08,920
is the damages that are linked in
particular to the forage resources

56
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,521
which are the basis of livestock feed.

57
00:04:23,496 --> 00:04:29,521
Let’s stop a little on the mission
of the public authorities in Senegal

58
00:04:29,721 --> 00:04:32,461
regarding the management of fires.

59
00:04:33,136 --> 00:04:38,454
It should be noted that the State of
Senegal

60
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:44,418
has initiated for years programs 
of monitoring and management

61
00:04:44,618 --> 00:04:45,272
of bushfires,

62
00:04:45,472 --> 00:04:49,177
particularly with the Direction
of Water and Forests, Hunting

63
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:51,598
and Soil Conservation

64
00:04:51,798 --> 00:04:57,077
by establishing a monitoring strategy.

65
00:04:57,277 --> 00:05:03,123
It is in this context also that
the Ecological Monitoring Center

66
00:05:03,323 --> 00:05:09,423
CSE, since 1990, uses spatial
techniques

67
00:05:09,623 --> 00:05:13,865
presently by using the data of
the MODIS satellite -

68
00:05:14,065 --> 00:05:18,367
so they use spatial techniques
for the monitoring and cartography

69
00:05:18,567 --> 00:05:21,256
of the burned areas.

70
00:05:21,456 --> 00:05:24,928
Regarding the collection,
processing and

71
00:05:25,128 --> 00:05:29,591
and distribution of
information on bushfires,

72
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,113
an integrated system involving

73
00:05:33,313 --> 00:05:36,728
the various structures of the
Ministry of the Environment

74
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:43,571
and the National Meteorological Agency
is implemented with a roadmap

75
00:05:43,771 --> 00:05:47,389
and well-defined roles in order to convey

76
00:05:47,589 --> 00:05:52,506
an information on fires, an information
that is unique and reliable.

77
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:57,649
We also proceed, always in
the case of the mission,

78
00:05:57,849 --> 00:06:02,422
to a spatial analysis and a
cartographic representation

79
00:06:02,622 --> 00:06:08,149
of the products in order to provide
synthetic information

80
00:06:08,374 --> 00:06:13,849
as a support for decision at the 
level of the Ministry of the Environment.

81
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:30,239
With regards to the methodology
and role of geographic information systems,

82
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:32,414
we must distinguish two things:

83
00:06:32,614 --> 00:06:37,227
the follow-up campaign itself and
the development of seasonal reports.

84
00:06:37,427 --> 00:06:40,214
With regards to the follow-up
campaign of bushfires,

85
00:06:40,414 --> 00:06:46,575
there is obviously the detection of
fires by the MODIS satellite image

86
00:06:46,775 --> 00:06:51,452
and also the characterization
of the sites identified in situ.

87
00:06:51,652 --> 00:06:57,399
And what you need to know is that
this follow-up campaign of fires

88
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,495
is conducted from October
to May during the dry season

89
00:07:01,695 --> 00:07:06,256
and is based on the use of MODIS imagery.

90
00:07:06,456 --> 00:07:11,844
The use of these satellite data 
offer bushfires

91
00:07:12,044 --> 00:07:20,141
monitoring opportunities and
the study of thermal anomalies

92
00:07:20,341 --> 00:07:25,785
by the MODIS satellite has 
become a common tool

93
00:07:25,985 --> 00:07:30,435
of characterization of spatial
and temporal distribution

94
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:38,310
of bushfires based on the energy
emitted by fires.

95
00:07:38,643 --> 00:07:45,785
These satellites allow to have 
data on active fires

96
00:07:45,985 --> 00:07:47,139
twice a day.

97
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:53,540
The method used to study the fire regime

98
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:58,893
consists of counting the number
of burned pixels on a monthly basis.

99
00:07:59,093 --> 00:08:03,511
The data collected are used to
construct evolution curves

100
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:06,949
of the fires during the dry season.

101
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:13,470
In the seasonal report that we transmit

102
00:08:13,670 --> 00:08:16,670
to decision-makers, to the authorities,

103
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:23,904
we proceed to the analysis of the
spatial and temporal 

104
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:30,697
distribution  of fires,
and the production of maps.

105
00:08:31,809 --> 00:08:37,545
And it is to formulate, to make
an impact assessment

106
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:44,565
in terms of economic loss and,
finally, to make recommendations.

107
00:08:44,765 --> 00:08:47,765
But it must be said that there
is a space-time mask

108
00:08:47,965 --> 00:08:51,465
which is defined with the Direction
of Water and Forests and the local communities.

109
00:08:51,665 --> 00:08:54,165
There is a mask that is applied
to the burned areas

110
00:08:54,365 --> 00:08:57,365
in order to exclude fires in the fields

111
00:08:57,565 --> 00:08:59,434
or what we call clearing fires

112
00:08:59,634 --> 00:09:02,913
and the fires triggered as a
precautionary measure or early fires

113
00:09:03,113 --> 00:09:09,830
to keep only what may be
considered as a bushfire.

114
00:09:10,105 --> 00:09:13,746
The analysis of the temporal
distribution will allow us to determine

115
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,766
the number of fires by month.

116
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:19,321
We will do it with the QGIS software.

117
00:09:20,371 --> 00:09:27,149
With QGIS, we will go in the
database menu

118
00:09:27,349 --> 00:09:31,388
and take the QSpatiaLite
extension.

119
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:38,329
And the extension will allow us
to make the SQL query

120
00:09:38,529 --> 00:09:42,492
on the Fire_2014_2015 table.

121
00:09:42,692 --> 00:09:45,692
Here, we will...

122
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:48,892
The first thing to do is to
take SELECT,

123
00:09:49,092 --> 00:09:50,842
so it is the SELECT FROM WHERE.

124
00:09:51,042 --> 00:09:57,587
In SELECT, we have to type the formula
that you see on the screen.

125
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:07,548
So SELECT is what you have to
type, STRFTIME in brackets etc.

126
00:10:07,875 --> 00:10:10,153
In the FROM now,

127
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:16,560
you will select the
Fire_2014_2015 table.

128
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,446
We can even add an alias F.

129
00:10:18,646 --> 00:10:23,121
The alias will allow us not
to repeat this table

130
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:29,647
since it is going to be too
long Fire table 2014-2015

131
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,587
but just the F.

132
00:10:30,787 --> 00:10:34,427
So this F-is going to be in SELCT.
Now we have F.

133
00:10:34,627 --> 00:10:37,082
So SELECT is done.

134
00:10:37,282 --> 00:10:39,866
FROM is OK.

135
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:41,673
And we are going to put GROUP BY.

136
00:10:41,873 --> 00:10:47,779
In GROUP By, we will do the
same thing

137
00:10:47,979 --> 00:10:50,218
as what we did in the SELECT.

138
00:10:50,418 --> 00:10:56,240
So we will go back to
SELECT to add the COUNT.

139
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,447
This is important since it
will allow us for each month,

140
00:11:00,647 --> 00:11:01,587
as you can see here,

141
00:11:01,784 --> 00:11:06,121
for each month to give the
number of fires we observed.

142
00:11:06,321 --> 00:11:11,799
Now we have to save everything
in a table

143
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:13,501
and load it into QGIS.

144
00:11:13,701 --> 00:11:16,701
We can give a name to the
table, it is temporal table.

145
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:19,797
Since we do a temporal analysis,
we will use temporal.

146
00:11:19,997 --> 00:11:24,522
And there you see, here we have
this table that is displayed.

147
00:11:24,722 --> 00:11:28,135
We can even open this table
and you will see,

148
00:11:28,335 --> 00:11:33,056
we have the months and next to it,
we have the number of fires observed.

149
00:11:33,306 --> 00:11:41,153
We will save it, if we want,
in CSV format

150
00:11:41,353 --> 00:11:47,832
to make analyzes with Excel if we want.

151
00:11:48,020 --> 00:11:51,310
The objective is to determine the
number of fires by department.

152
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:54,010
So here we will do the same thing.

153
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:55,961
We will load QSpatiaLite.

154
00:11:56,161 --> 00:12:02,691
And so we will do the same operation,
except that here,

155
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:04,816
it is not a question of having
the number of fires per month

156
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:09,877
but the number of fires per
administrative department of Senegal.

157
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:15,672
So still in the SQL query, we have
the SELECT, FROM and WHERE.

158
00:12:15,872 --> 00:12:22,303
And in FROM, it is the departments
that will interest us

159
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:25,703
and also the fires, the Fire table.

160
00:12:25,903 --> 00:12:28,790
So we have both tables in
the FROM, departments table,

161
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:36,166
with the alias D which we will prepare
and Fire_2014_2015 that we will call F.

162
00:12:36,366 --> 00:12:40,638
So in the SELECT,
we will take the field

163
00:12:40,838 --> 00:12:45,151
called name_department of the
department table

164
00:12:45,351 --> 00:12:55,286
and we will add the COUNT function,
in brackets the "primary"

165
00:12:55,486 --> 00:13:02,725
which is the primary key of the
Fire_2014_2015 table

166
00:13:02,925 --> 00:13:08,552
and in the WHERE, we will take

167
00:13:08,752 --> 00:13:16,071
all the fires that are
in the departments.

168
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:21,219
So the formula is WITHIN, 
in brackets F.GEOMETRY,

169
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:31,754
that is to say, the fire that is in
a given department

170
00:13:31,967 --> 00:13:32,928
so which are in the departments,

171
00:13:33,128 --> 00:13:36,755
and we will add GROUP BY
as we had earlier

172
00:13:36,955 --> 00:13:39,955
with the department name.

173
00:13:40,155 --> 00:13:41,673
Here is the result that it gives us.

174
00:13:41,873 --> 00:13:47,625
We will click on RUN SQL,
which gives this table that you see

175
00:13:47,825 --> 00:13:50,169
with for each department of
Senegal,

176
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:53,078
the number of fires we observed.

177
00:13:53,278 --> 00:13:58,702
We will also create a ...

178
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:06,710
We will save this query as
a spatial table

179
00:14:06,910 --> 00:14:14,206
so we go in option, choose
Create Spatial Table

180
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:18,639
and in Table Name, we will
put spatial.

181
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:25,231
And something very important
since it is a spatial table,

182
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:29,472
we will add in SELECT the
aspect...the geometric attribute.

183
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:31,913
So we add the D.GEOMETRY.

184
00:14:32,113 --> 00:14:37,250
And here in "geometry field",
we will also add

185
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:40,762
the geometry aspect, that is to
ie D.GEOMETRY.

186
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:44,447
And here you see the
result it gives us.

187
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:48,839
This result that you see.

188
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:54,306
For all the departments where
there was at least one fire,

189
00:14:54,506 --> 00:14:56,793
there is this table.

190
00:14:56,993 --> 00:14:59,056
Now we can make several links,

191
00:14:59,256 --> 00:15:01,647
we can carry out to the spatial
analysis </ i>

192
00:15:01,847 --> 00:15:09,767
by going into the styles of the
layers, by right-clicking on "properties"

193
00:15:09,967 --> 00:15:12,238
and that gives us that window.

194
00:15:12,463 --> 00:15:19,464
So here is the result that we have
concerning spatial analysis. </ I>

195
00:15:19,664 --> 00:15:27,916
As you can see, there is
a spatial distribution </ i>

196
00:15:28,116 --> 00:15:34,377
of bushfires throughout Senegal </ i>

197
00:15:34,577 --> 00:15:40,502
with a concentration of fires
in the South-East part, </ i>

198
00:15:40,702 --> 00:15:45,416
precisely in the departments
of Goudiry, Tambacounda </ i>

199
00:15:45,616 --> 00:15:47,232
and Saraya. </ I>

200
00:15:58,231 --> 00:16:03,000
With regarde to the results,
we need to know two things: </ i>

201
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:06,200
the results during the season</ i>

202
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:11,938
and the results that we give at
the end of the season, </ i>

203
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:19,426
that is to say after the end of
May, that is to say in June. </ I>

204
00:16:19,626 --> 00:16:23,792
In terms of the results
during the season, </ i>

205
00:16:23,992 --> 00:16:28,540
it is generally the weekly
bulletins </ i>

206
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:35,055
where we assess the situation,
the fire monitoring. </ I>

207
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:43,344
Now at the end of the season,
we provide </ i>

208
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:52,379
the authorities with maps of
the synthesis which list </ i>

209
00:16:52,579 --> 00:16:57,096
all the fires observed 
in October until May </ i>

210
00:16:57,296 --> 00:17:00,860
by also doing analyzes, </ i>

211
00:17:01,060 --> 00:17:07,023
particularly in terms of
economic impact </ i>

212
00:17:07,223 --> 00:17:10,861
and make recommendations. </ I>

213
00:17:11,061 --> 00:17:18,503
I would like to pause 
a little bit </ i>

214
00:17:18,703 --> 00:17:23,609
on the analysis of 
economic impacts. </ I>

215
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:30,035
The aim here is to identify
and give a monetary value </ i>

216
00:17:30,235 --> 00:17:32,805
<I>to damages related to fires, </ i>

217
00:17:33,005 --> 00:17:39,232
as well as to interventions
to combat this scourge. </ I>

218
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:44,812
What can also be said is that a
good exploitation of these data </ ​​i>

219
00:17:45,012 --> 00:17:49,250
can contribute enormously
to the fight and better, </ i>

220
00:17:49,450 --> 00:17:52,821
to the management of bushfires. </ I>

221
00:18:03,056 --> 00:18:11,775
To sum up, we can say that
geographic information systems

222
00:18:11,975 --> 00:18:19,085
are a tool that allow us to better
manage bushfires

223
00:18:19,285 --> 00:18:27,854
in the sense that they allow us to know
the months in which we register

224
00:18:28,054 --> 00:18:30,710
the greatest number of fires,
so the months to watch,

225
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:33,226
it is important. Secondly,

226
00:18:33,426 --> 00:18:37,421
information systems with spatial reference

227
00:18:37,621 --> 00:18:43,607
allow us to determine the
most vulnerable departments.

228
00:18:43,807 --> 00:18:51,883
And this allows the authorities
to take the necessary measures

229
00:18:52,096 --> 00:18:57,531
in order to have a better 
management of bushfires.
