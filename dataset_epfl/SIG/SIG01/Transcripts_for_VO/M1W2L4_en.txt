00:00:22,574 --> 00:00:24,086
Welcome to this lesson

2
00:00:24,286 --> 00:00:26,624
on the digitalization of vectorial object.

3
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,787
You will see how to extract
the geometric characteristics

4
00:00:29,999 --> 00:00:32,587
of an image or an analog card

5
00:00:32,787 --> 00:00:35,912
to integrate it into your database.

6
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,737
As Fernand said, this course focuses on

7
00:00:39,937 --> 00:00:43,662
data editing, the digitalization 
of vectorial objects

8
00:00:43,862 --> 00:00:46,774
and especially the editing tools

9
00:00:46,974 --> 00:00:49,912
which are present in the QGIS software.

10
00:00:50,449 --> 00:00:52,799
We have seen in previous lessons

11
00:00:53,024 --> 00:00:56,449
how to acquire data by
different methods,

12
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,199
whether it is a terrestrial, 
airborne, or even satellite method.

13
00:01:00,749 --> 00:01:02,286
We have also seen how

14
00:01:02,486 --> 00:01:04,236
the images obtained, the data obtained

15
00:01:04,437 --> 00:01:06,762
could be geo-referenced

16
00:01:06,962 --> 00:01:10,024
and positioned in a geographical
information system.

17
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:13,399
The next step,
often from images,

18
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:16,062
consists in identifying objects,

19
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:19,812
cutting them, drawing their outlines

20
00:01:20,012 --> 00:01:21,325
to integrate them

21
00:01:21,537 --> 00:01:23,912
with their characteristics, 
their attributes

22
00:01:24,137 --> 00:01:25,537
in a database.

23
00:01:25,749 --> 00:01:27,624
The objective of the lesson is
to teach you

24
00:01:27,837 --> 00:01:31,362
how to create some new geographic
objects in a GIS software,

25
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:34,212
and to draw your attention 
on the importance

26
00:01:34,412 --> 00:01:37,850
of the topology
management for the digitalization.

27
00:01:38,475 --> 00:01:41,474
At the end of the lesson
you should be able

28
00:01:41,687 --> 00:01:43,512
to create new data layers,

29
00:01:43,712 --> 00:01:46,812
to feed them using the editing
tools

30
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:49,587
and the computer assisted 
drawing tools.

31
00:01:51,337 --> 00:01:54,100
In this lesson we will
discuss successively

32
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,674
general elements related
to the digitalization

33
00:01:56,912 --> 00:01:58,387
of vectorial objects.

34
00:01:58,625 --> 00:02:00,575
Then we will focus on the way

35
00:02:00,775 --> 00:02:03,675
these tools are presented
in the QGIS software

36
00:02:03,875 --> 00:02:06,750
by first talking about
simple editing tools

37
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:08,950
and then about the snap management

38
00:02:09,175 --> 00:02:12,262
before moving on to
advanced editing tools

39
00:02:12,462 --> 00:02:16,362
and finishing with the
assisted drawing tools.

40
00:02:23,137 --> 00:02:26,525
Amongst the important aspects
of geodata editing,

41
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:28,950
we can start with
the fact that the objects

42
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,350
are organized in a thematic layer

43
00:02:31,575 --> 00:02:35,200
as here in the case of the Seychelles,
which we now know well.

44
00:02:35,412 --> 00:02:37,712
A layer for hotels, a layer for roads,

45
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:40,675
a layer for districts, etc, etc ...

46
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:43,787
Most often each thematic
layer is associated

47
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,787
to a specific type of geometry:

48
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,262
either points, lines or polygons.

49
00:02:49,712 --> 00:02:52,337
Some softwares, such as Manifold

50
00:02:52,537 --> 00:02:55,000
in the illustration
which is here on the right,

51
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,800
allow to manage several 
types of geometry

52
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,587
in the same layer.

53
00:03:00,787 --> 00:03:04,575
We see it here in the editing tools

54
00:03:04,812 --> 00:03:07,850
that allow to create lines, polygons,

55
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:10,437
points, rectangles, circles.

56
00:03:11,275 --> 00:03:13,362
All this in a single layer.

57
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:17,137
And in the toolbar that
allows you to manage

58
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:19,850
the object format of the layer

59
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,237
with a section that is
dedicated to polygons,

60
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,575
a section that is dedicated to polylines

61
00:03:26,775 --> 00:03:30,137
and finally a section that
is intended for the shaping

62
00:03:30,337 --> 00:03:32,062
of punctual objects.

63
00:03:33,162 --> 00:03:37,162
Each thematic layer is ultimately
associated with a data model

64
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,962
or a list of attributes.

65
00:03:39,162 --> 00:03:42,400
This data model has to be
shared by all these objects.

66
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:44,625
This model appears,

67
00:03:44,825 --> 00:03:47,362
either when we
interrogate a particular object

68
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:49,125
and its characteristics,

69
00:03:49,325 --> 00:03:52,325
or when we edit the attribute table

70
00:03:52,525 --> 00:03:55,375
which is associated with 
the data layer itself.

71
00:03:57,237 --> 00:03:59,375
A fundamental element
of data editing

72
00:03:59,575 --> 00:04:03,400
is obviously to be able 
to create, modify and delete

73
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,100
the geographical objects
and their attributes

74
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:10,562
with here the illustration
of the geometry modification,

75
00:04:10,762 --> 00:04:13,000
in this case the main axis of a road

76
00:04:13,237 --> 00:04:16,200
and the modification of the attributes,

77
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,725
including here the type of road.

78
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:21,912
The topology management is
also an important aspect

79
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:23,425
of data editing

80
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:27,300
since we would like to be able to 
force the new points that we create

81
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,825
to use points or existing segments,

82
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:34,862
process called "snap" in english.

83
00:04:35,062 --> 00:04:36,612
This is particularly the case when

84
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:38,600
we draw polygons like here

85
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:42,112
and that we would like the
points used by these polygons

86
00:04:42,312 --> 00:04:44,812
to correspond to existing points,

87
00:04:45,012 --> 00:04:47,300
to adjacent polygons.

88
00:04:47,537 --> 00:04:49,887
As we will see in the module
dedicated to storage

89
00:04:50,087 --> 00:04:52,887
and especially in the
course on databases,

90
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:54,687
each object of a data layer

91
00:04:54,887 --> 00:04:56,775
has to be able to be 
unequivocally identified,

92
00:04:56,975 --> 00:04:58,299
which is often done

93
00:04:58,499 --> 00:05:00,512
via an identifier field

94
00:05:00,724 --> 00:05:02,087
called ID.

95
00:05:02,687 --> 00:05:04,837
And this field should be 
able to be managed

96
00:05:05,062 --> 00:05:06,824
when we do data editing.

97
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,075
So we will start by watching

98
00:05:20,287 --> 00:05:25,012
how the simple editing
tools work in the QGIS software.

99
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,075
So we have a project
in which we create

100
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,812
a new layer of shapefile type,

101
00:05:32,012 --> 00:05:33,837
a polygon layer in which

102
00:05:34,062 --> 00:05:36,675
we define an attribute, the name,

103
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,837
that we add to the
attributes already present.

104
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:41,975
We see that the identifier is already
present by default.

105
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,950
We call this layer "polygon"

106
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:46,775
and we save it somewhere.

107
00:05:48,337 --> 00:05:51,225
Then we activate the toolbar

108
00:05:51,425 --> 00:05:54,612
entitled "scanning".

109
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,562
This toolbar includes
a number of tools

110
00:05:56,787 --> 00:05:59,487
particularly this one which allows

111
00:05:59,687 --> 00:06:02,087
to put the layer in editing mode

112
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,412
and then to select the drawing tool

113
00:06:04,612 --> 00:06:08,937
and to draw a geometric shape 
by successively clicking

114
00:06:09,137 --> 00:06:12,387
and to finish drawing 
by right-clicking.

115
00:06:12,775 --> 00:06:16,337
Once the drawing is complete,
as we have seen we can document

116
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,050
the attributes of the object.

117
00:06:19,512 --> 00:06:22,325
For now the identifier remains nil

118
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,275
and we simply give a name,

119
00:06:24,487 --> 00:06:27,537
A for the first shape, B for the second.

120
00:06:29,825 --> 00:06:32,025
Amongst the other tools 
in the toolbar,

121
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,587
the registering tool

122
00:06:33,812 --> 00:06:36,775
or the more general tool
that enables to register

123
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:39,250
several layers simultaneously

124
00:06:39,925 --> 00:06:42,437
or to go back on editions
that have been made

125
00:06:42,637 --> 00:06:44,437
in one or more layers.

126
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:47,325
The shifting tool,

127
00:06:48,012 --> 00:06:51,750
a tool which is then
used to edit a geometry

128
00:06:51,962 --> 00:06:54,037
and to modify its points

129
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:59,287
either individually or by moving
the segments as a whole.

130
00:06:59,562 --> 00:07:02,487
A double-click to create a new point

131
00:07:03,512 --> 00:07:08,075
and simply select a point
and delete to remove points.

132
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,975
We can save these changes.

133
00:07:13,125 --> 00:07:15,787
And for the rest of the tools

134
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,475
another toolbar called "attribute"

135
00:07:18,687 --> 00:07:19,837
which contains selection tools

136
00:07:20,037 --> 00:07:22,312
is needed.

137
00:07:22,512 --> 00:07:24,112
We will be able here

138
00:07:24,312 --> 00:07:26,175
to activate the object
selection tool by click,

139
00:07:26,375 --> 00:07:28,362
we select an object and we see that

140
00:07:28,562 --> 00:07:31,662
the little trash enables 
to delete objects.

141
00:07:32,662 --> 00:07:37,062
This operation can be canceled by
returning to the previous situation.

142
00:07:37,325 --> 00:07:38,662
We re-select this object

143
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,937
and now we have a tool 
that allows to cut.

144
00:07:42,137 --> 00:07:45,275
This stores the object in the clipboard

145
00:07:45,475 --> 00:07:47,662
and we can paste it again to 
make it come back.

146
00:07:47,862 --> 00:07:50,712
We can also copy an object,

147
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:53,350
we deselect it, we can paste it.

148
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:56,875
And then the new object that
has been pasted can be moved.

149
00:07:57,075 --> 00:08:00,575
And in this way we can clone an object.

150
00:08:01,650 --> 00:08:04,587
In the preferences, under "option",

151
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:08,450
we can change the symbology
used for edited objects.

152
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:12,162
So to extend the edition to all
the objects of a layer

153
00:08:12,362 --> 00:08:16,037
and use a semi-transparent circle
rather than a red cross

154
00:08:16,237 --> 00:08:18,725
for the  the summits of these objects.

155
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,612
Then also in the attribute table

156
00:08:21,812 --> 00:08:25,612
we can now look at the identifier
of the objects.

157
00:08:25,812 --> 00:08:30,362
By changing the definition
of this section,

158
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,350
and by adding this identifier variable

159
00:08:33,550 --> 00:08:37,200
that will automatically assign
an identifier to the objects

160
00:08:37,412 --> 00:08:39,250
as they are created.

161
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:49,387
Finally in the extensions
we can add objects.

162
00:08:49,587 --> 00:08:52,962
There are many extensions
linked to drawings

163
00:08:53,162 --> 00:08:55,700
especially CAD Digitize

164
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:58,862
which is used to draw circles,

165
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:01,237
ellipses and arcs of circles.

166
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,600
We install this extension

167
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,737
which is manifested by
the appearance of a new toolbar.

168
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:17,662
This toolbar offers a number
of drawing tools

169
00:09:17,862 --> 00:09:20,862
in particular the ability to draw a circle

170
00:09:21,062 --> 00:09:23,462
from 2 points.

171
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,837
The possibility to draw a rectangle again

172
00:09:30,037 --> 00:09:32,837
from 3 points this time.

173
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:41,200
The drawing of an ellipse
with its center and 2 points of reference.

174
00:09:43,562 --> 00:09:49,325
And finally the drawing of an arc 
of a circle from a starting point.

175
00:09:54,587 --> 00:09:57,012
We can see that in the options 
of these tools

176
00:09:57,212 --> 00:09:59,637
it is possible, in particular 
for the arcs,

177
00:09:59,837 --> 00:10:04,125
to change the interval between
the points on the arc of a circle,

178
00:10:04,362 --> 00:10:06,475
so to modify the density of points

179
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:09,787
with which the arc of a circle is drawn.

180
00:10:21,899 --> 00:10:25,824
We take the same QGIS project as before

181
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:30,824
and activate under the "preferences"
menu the snap options

182
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:33,486
in which we see that we
can select the layers

183
00:10:33,686 --> 00:10:35,311
on which the snap will be done.

184
00:10:35,523 --> 00:10:37,073
We will keep the current layer

185
00:10:37,286 --> 00:10:38,511
for now since there is only one.

186
00:10:38,712 --> 00:10:41,937
The object type, the summit,
a segment, or both.

187
00:10:42,237 --> 00:10:45,749
So we will snap on the existing summits

188
00:10:45,974 --> 00:10:48,098
and define a snap tolerance

189
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:50,536
in pixel in map unit.

190
00:10:50,812 --> 00:10:54,124
Here, we set a tolerance of 30 pixels.

191
00:10:54,562 --> 00:10:57,187
And we see that when we draw a new object,

192
00:10:57,387 --> 00:11:00,474
the new points that we create 
are forced

193
00:11:00,712 --> 00:11:04,074
within a radius of 30 pixels
on the existing points,

194
00:11:04,324 --> 00:11:06,812
which allows to draw

195
00:11:07,012 --> 00:11:12,999
an object that is adjacent to
an existing polygon.

196
00:11:14,337 --> 00:11:17,662
If we force the snap on the segments,

197
00:11:17,862 --> 00:11:22,237
we can create objects 
that come and stand

198
00:11:22,474 --> 00:11:25,637
along existing objects segments.

199
00:11:31,962 --> 00:11:34,399
By activating the points of an object

200
00:11:34,612 --> 00:11:39,124
we see  that if we move them,
they move independently.

201
00:11:39,687 --> 00:11:43,674
On the contrary, if the topological 
edition becomes active

202
00:11:44,062 --> 00:11:48,849
the points shared between several 
objects will be moved

203
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:51,574
simultaneously for the two objects

204
00:11:51,774 --> 00:11:56,224
so as to maintain a coherent topology.

205
00:11:59,499 --> 00:12:03,261
By now adding a second polygon layer,

206
00:12:03,624 --> 00:12:10,149
we can show how the snap works
on several layers.

207
00:12:10,611 --> 00:12:13,349
So here, when we have only 
one activated layer

208
00:12:13,549 --> 00:12:15,874
which is in fact the polygons B layer,
the green one,

209
00:12:16,074 --> 00:12:18,636
we see that this is the only 
one that reacts

210
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:20,711
when we draw a new object.

211
00:12:20,949 --> 00:12:23,349
Here we have only one activated layer,

212
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:25,799
it is the blue polygons layer.

213
00:12:25,999 --> 00:12:28,574
If we now activate all the layers,

214
00:12:28,774 --> 00:12:32,274
we see that all the summits
of the polygons of the two layers

215
00:12:32,474 --> 00:12:35,236
are active for the snap.

216
00:12:35,436 --> 00:12:38,824
We can also manage the snap in
different ways

217
00:12:39,036 --> 00:12:41,411
on the different layers

218
00:12:41,636 --> 00:12:45,736
by managing the type
of object on which the snap takes place

219
00:12:45,961 --> 00:12:48,311
by managing the snap tolerance.

220
00:12:48,499 --> 00:12:51,361
We see that this table below the map
enables to manage

221
00:12:51,561 --> 00:12:55,161
the snap on the different layers
present in the map

222
00:12:55,361 --> 00:12:57,124
in a rather flexible manner.

223
00:12:57,924 --> 00:13:00,324
When the snap is activated
on the intersections

224
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:03,936
and all the layers are active,

225
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:06,736
we can see that we can select 
both the summits 

226
00:13:06,936 --> 00:13:10,674
and the intersections
between polygons as anchor points.

227
00:13:23,799 --> 00:13:27,274
QGIS offers some advanced editing tools

228
00:13:27,774 --> 00:13:33,074
which we activate by displaying
the tool bar of the same name.

229
00:13:33,361 --> 00:13:37,524
A toolbar entitled "advanced scan".

230
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:43,786
So, this toolbar includes

231
00:13:43,986 --> 00:13:46,649
a wide variety of tools, starting with

232
00:13:46,849 --> 00:13:50,686
a tool that allow to pivot
geographical entities.

233
00:13:50,924 --> 00:13:56,374
It includes buttons
to cancel and restore the changes.

234
00:13:56,886 --> 00:14:00,361
A second tool that allows to 
simplify entities

235
00:14:00,561 --> 00:14:06,524
by defining the level
of simplification sought.

236
00:14:08,061 --> 00:14:13,749
A tool which allows to add
a ring in an existing polygon,

237
00:14:13,949 --> 00:14:18,386
so by drawing a hole in the Emmental.

238
00:14:18,986 --> 00:14:23,011
The corresponding tool that allows
to delete a ring

239
00:14:23,211 --> 00:14:25,349
simply by clicking on it.

240
00:14:25,549 --> 00:14:29,711
Then a tool that allows to add
a part to a polygon

241
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:32,236
which becomes a multipart

242
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:34,636
so you have to select the object first,

243
00:14:34,836 --> 00:14:38,211
activate the tool, draw the new part

244
00:14:38,686 --> 00:14:43,699
and then we see that our object is now
composed of two elements.

245
00:14:44,336 --> 00:14:47,799
With this object still being selected,

246
00:14:48,736 --> 00:14:54,224
we can create a ring which is
not a hole in the Emmental

247
00:14:54,424 --> 00:14:56,336
but which is a new object.

248
00:14:57,374 --> 00:15:00,411
So we cut, we intersect an existing polygon

249
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:02,473
with a new polygon.

250
00:15:02,724 --> 00:15:06,399
We can see that the lower polygon

251
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:10,899
has a hole which we can also
delete obvioulsy.

252
00:15:11,099 --> 00:15:14,236
Then we have a tool which 
allows to remodel entities

253
00:15:14,436 --> 00:15:18,711
by adding elements, growths

254
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:22,661
and cutting tools.

255
00:15:27,036 --> 00:15:31,474
We select an object and we can 
cut it here by a line

256
00:15:31,674 --> 00:15:33,236
in 2 objects

257
00:15:33,436 --> 00:15:35,574
which will be independent 
from one another.

258
00:15:35,786 --> 00:15:39,449
So we can select alternatively 
one or the other or both.

259
00:15:39,674 --> 00:15:43,449
We can also cut an object to create

260
00:15:43,661 --> 00:15:48,274
parts again with a line

261
00:15:48,824 --> 00:15:52,649
and unlike the previous case,
here the two objects remain linked

262
00:15:52,861 --> 00:15:53,961
so if one is selected ,

263
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:56,949
the other is also automatically selected.

264
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:06,686
Then we have tools which
allow to merge some objects.

265
00:16:06,886 --> 00:16:10,174
So we select 2 objects and we can
merge them.

266
00:16:10,374 --> 00:16:12,986
We can see that by selecting them

267
00:16:13,186 --> 00:16:16,636
we have an object that now
is composed of 3 parts.

268
00:16:28,349 --> 00:16:30,636
We therefore have a project with 2 layers

269
00:16:30,836 --> 00:16:34,111
a polygon layer and a polyline layer.

270
00:16:34,311 --> 00:16:37,374
The polygon layer is put 
into editing mode,

271
00:16:37,574 --> 00:16:40,361
we select the drawing tool

272
00:16:40,561 --> 00:16:44,549
which actually enables to activate
the advanced scanning tools.

273
00:16:44,749 --> 00:16:48,124
This series of tools includes
an activation button

274
00:16:48,336 --> 00:16:50,399
of the DAO tool itself

275
00:16:51,049 --> 00:16:53,199
and a button that allows
to switch between

276
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:55,274
the drawing mode and the
construction method,

277
00:16:55,474 --> 00:16:57,299
whose use we will see later,

278
00:16:57,499 --> 00:17:02,224
and then snap options that
replace the standard options

279
00:17:02,461 --> 00:17:03,961
of QGIS.

280
00:17:04,499 --> 00:17:05,849
Here to start my drawing

281
00:17:06,049 --> 00:17:09,049
I chose to take a point at the
coordinates 0 0

282
00:17:09,249 --> 00:17:12,574
then I set it with the small padlock.

283
00:17:12,774 --> 00:17:15,611
I selected this point as a
starting point of my drawing

284
00:17:15,811 --> 00:17:18,835
then I decide to draw a line that leads me

285
00:17:19,035 --> 00:17:22,423
to the point of coordinates X10 Y=1,

286
00:17:22,861 --> 00:17:26,086
a point which appears there, that I also set.

287
00:17:26,499 --> 00:17:29,899
I continue drawing by saying that 
I have to have a right angle here

288
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:33,336
and a distance of 6 meters

289
00:17:33,536 --> 00:17:37,824
which gives me the third point
of my polygon.

290
00:17:38,024 --> 00:17:42,386
I would like to draw my
last point so that we are at coordinate 0

291
00:17:42,586 --> 00:17:45,424
with a right angle.

292
00:17:45,624 --> 00:17:48,024
So I set the coordinate 0,

293
00:17:48,249 --> 00:17:53,511
I go into construction
mode to set a construction point.

294
00:17:54,349 --> 00:17:55,836
And for this construction point,

295
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:59,199
I will now define an 90 degrees angle,

296
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:02,099
the nil coordinate.

297
00:18:02,599 --> 00:18:06,449
And these 2 parameters for the construction 
point give me the targeted point.

298
00:18:07,036 --> 00:18:12,761
I then have to go back to the drawing 
mode to materialize this point

299
00:18:12,961 --> 00:18:17,524
which will be positioned where
I want to have it.

300
00:18:22,099 --> 00:18:25,186
Here we will select a starting point

301
00:18:25,386 --> 00:18:28,236
as a construction point
to locate a point

302
00:18:28,436 --> 00:18:31,386
which is located along the 
edge of this polygon

303
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:33,624
at a distance of 3 meters.

304
00:18:33,861 --> 00:18:36,649
And here we want
to actually draw what could be a pipe

305
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:40,761
coming out of a building at a right 
angles at a distance of 3 meters.

306
00:18:40,974 --> 00:18:44,899
So here we set a right angle 
and a distance...

307
00:18:45,099 --> 00:18:48,699
let's say that this pipe is 8 meters long,

308
00:18:48,899 --> 00:18:51,874
so a distance of 8 meters 
as its point of arrival.

309
00:18:52,074 --> 00:18:53,936
And it is done.

310
00:18:54,136 --> 00:18:59,924
Another example, I wish to draw a 
line parallel to this facade

311
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:02,386
at a distance of 1 meter.

312
00:19:02,586 --> 00:19:05,499
So I take again as a construction point

313
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:07,586
the angle of the object,

314
00:19:07,786 --> 00:19:09,786
a distance of 1 meter, which gives me

315
00:19:09,986 --> 00:19:11,936
the starting point of my new line.

316
00:19:12,136 --> 00:19:15,674
I switch to the drawing
mode to materialize this starting point

317
00:19:16,764 --> 00:19:20,589
and again in construction mode

318
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:22,852
I select the parallel tool

319
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:27,702
which allows me to select the line
I want to use as a guide

320
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:30,852
then to position my point at
the intersection

321
00:19:31,064 --> 00:19:34,389
this time again in drawing
mode to materialize

322
00:19:34,589 --> 00:19:39,202
the second point of my line
parallel to the side of the polygon.

323
00:19:50,952 --> 00:19:53,189
In this lesson we have illustrated

324
00:19:53,389 --> 00:19:58,363
the use of tools for vectorial
objects editing in QGIS.

325
00:19:59,014 --> 00:20:00,837
Simple tools, advanced tools,

326
00:20:01,037 --> 00:20:04,037
computer assisted drawing tools.

327
00:20:04,319 --> 00:20:05,691
These tools are used

328
00:20:05,891 --> 00:20:08,504
either to create point-blank objects

329
00:20:08,757 --> 00:20:12,845
but more often to digitalize 
existing elements

330
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:16,320
which we observe on aerial photographs

331
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:19,182
or satellite images.
