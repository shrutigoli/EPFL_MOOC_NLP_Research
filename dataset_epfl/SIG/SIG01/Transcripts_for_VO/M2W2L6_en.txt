00:00:21,927 --> 00:00:24,896
Hello and welcome to this lesson
which will focus on

2
00:00:25,096 --> 00:00:27,829
geometric spatial queries,

3
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:32,194
a set of queries that is more
specifically focused

4
00:00:32,414 --> 00:00:36,291
on extracting information on the
nature and geometric properties

5
00:00:36,503 --> 00:00:39,711
of spatial objects stored in a database.

6
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:43,868
The objective of this 
lesson is to explore

7
00:00:44,068 --> 00:00:48,293
this world of SQL queries that
seeks to extract geometric

8
00:00:48,493 --> 00:00:51,581
characteristic properties from
spatial objects stored

9
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:54,488
in a database, so that you are able to

10
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:58,285
retrieve information such
as the coordinates of a point,

11
00:00:58,485 --> 00:01:03,208
the perimeter or length of a line,
the surface of a polygon

12
00:01:03,408 --> 00:01:07,346
from spatial geometries hosted in
a database.

13
00:01:07,546 --> 00:01:12,128
<I> There is a large number of
different geometric spatial queries </ i>

14
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:17,041
<I> with a wide variety of
keywords that we cannot </ i>

15
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:20,241
<I> obviously all review
so we will present you </ i>

16
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:24,541
<I> some situations,
some typical queries </ i>

17
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:27,246
<I> which we consider particularly
important. </ I>

18
00:01:27,446 --> 00:01:30,446
<I> It's always a good idea
to check out the sites </ i>

19
00:01:30,646 --> 00:01:33,646
<I> of specialized softwares,
in this case the SpatiaLite site </ i>

20
00:01:33,846 --> 00:01:35,375
<I> and PostGIS site, </ i>

21
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:38,850
<I> to get a more complete idea </ i>

22
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,139
<I> of all the available 
functionalities in terms </ i>

23
00:01:42,351 --> 00:01:43,713
<I> of geometric spatial queries. </ I>

24
00:01:43,913 --> 00:01:47,236
<I> In general, the syntax is
pretty much the same </ i>

25
00:01:47,436 --> 00:01:50,436
<I> in all cases with a
particularity however </ i>

26
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:53,719
<I> in the PostGIS world which, when </ i>

27
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:58,998
<I> the query is on spatial
objects, prefaces the keyword </ i>

28
00:01:59,198 --> 00:02:04,620
<I>with the underlined letters ST, 
ST for Spatial Type, </ i>

29
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:09,258
<I> which allows, in a SQL query,
to clearly distinguish </ i>

30
00:02:09,458 --> 00:02:11,793
<I> everything that is addressing
spatial properties </ i>

31
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:16,566
<I> and that are specific to the
PostGIS world versus PostgreSQL world </ i>

32
00:02:16,766 --> 00:02:19,230
<I> on which PostGIS is built. </ I>

33
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:23,673
<I> But for the rest, the syntax
is the same as in SpatiaLite </ i>

34
00:02:23,873 --> 00:02:25,923
<I> with a few rare exceptions. </ I>

35
00:02:26,123 --> 00:02:29,660
<I> In this lesson, we will 
first talk about the queries </ i>

36
00:02:29,885 --> 00:02:33,013
<I>that allow to select and
to display geometries, </ i>

37
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:40,925
<I> display in a map, or to
consult the spatial reference used, </ i>

38
00:02:41,162 --> 00:02:42,495
<I> so the ESPG code. </ I>

39
00:02:42,695 --> 00:02:46,569
<I> We will then see some
syntax of SQL queries, </ i>

40
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:49,384
<I> of data conversion
to transform geometries </ i>

41
00:02:49,609 --> 00:02:52,160
<I> in text or binary format, </ i>

42
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:56,497
<I> queries that allow to extract,
to consult the type of geometry </ i>

43
00:02:56,722 --> 00:03:00,701
<I> with which we are dealing and
finally we will see a series of queries </ i>

44
00:03:00,901 --> 00:03:03,754
<I> that allow to retrieve the
specific properties </ i>

45
00:03:03,954 --> 00:03:05,301
<I>of geometries. </ I>

46
00:03:10,527 --> 00:03:15,348
<I> The GEOMETRY keyword typically
refers to the geometry attribute </ i>

47
00:03:15,548 --> 00:03:18,548
<I> of a spatial data table, </ i>

48
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:21,456
<I> so the geometry of
the spatial object </ i>

49
00:03:21,656 --> 00:03:24,506
<I> and it is used in selection queries </ i>

50
00:03:24,706 --> 00:03:27,856
<I> to display objects on a map. </ I>

51
00:03:28,056 --> 00:03:31,056
<I> It can also be used to extract </ i>

52
00:03:31,256 --> 00:03:33,984
<I> the reference of the 
projection system used </ i>

53
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:37,795
<I> or a lot of other information
that we will see later. </ I>

54
00:03:37,995 --> 00:03:41,227
<I> The syntax is based
simply on the SELECT, </ i>

55
00:03:41,427 --> 00:03:44,639
<I> keyword, GEOMETRY, we
select the geometries, </ i>

56
00:03:44,848 --> 00:03:47,510
<I> FROM, the name of the
table to indicate the table </ i>

57
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,313
<I> from which the geometries
are extracted. </ I>

58
00:03:49,513 --> 00:03:51,905
<I> Then, we can imagine
conditional clauses </ i>

59
00:03:52,105 --> 00:03:54,717
<I> which allow to sort, in
the geometries, </ i>

60
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:56,576
<I> those that meet certain
criteria. </ I>

61
00:03:56,776 --> 00:03:58,568
<I> We will see an example later. </ I>

62
00:03:58,768 --> 00:04:03,658
<I> The SRID keyword with
the GEOMETRY keyword in brackets </ i>

63
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:07,590
<I> to extract the reference of
the projection system used, </ i>

64
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:10,328
<I> in this case the ESPG code. </ I>

65
00:04:11,528 --> 00:04:15,252
<I> An example of the
application of these elements. </ I>

66
00:04:15,452 --> 00:04:18,452
<I> First, when it comes to
selecting objects, </ i>

67
00:04:18,652 --> 00:04:21,842
<I> the easiest way is to use the
integrated tool in QGIS </ i>

68
00:04:22,042 --> 00:04:28,418
<I> with a selection module
which uses </ i>

69
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:34,241
<I>the SQL language but the
SELECT GEOMETRY FROM is hidden </ i>

70
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:38,956
<I> and we simply add the
criterion in the SQL syntax, </ i>

71
00:04:39,156 --> 00:04:41,013
<I> here the name that begins with d, </ i>

72
00:04:41,213 --> 00:04:44,213
<I> and we select all the
districts whose name begins with d. </ I>

73
00:04:47,613 --> 00:04:50,613
<I> Second example, this
time in the SpatiaLite module, </ i>

74
00:04:50,813 --> 00:04:53,542
<I> again with a query in the
districts table </ i>

75
00:04:53,742 --> 00:04:56,142
<I> to select all districts of Mahé. </ I>

76
00:04:56,342 --> 00:04:59,178
<I> To display the results of
the query, </ i>

77
00:04:59,378 --> 00:05:02,945
<I> they must be loaded
as a new layer in QGIS, </ i>

78
00:05:03,145 --> 00:05:06,145
<I> a layer whose name and field
that contains </ i>

79
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:07,875
<I>the geometries must be defined. </ I>

80
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:15,435
<I> Finally, just as we did
with the QGIS query, </ i>

81
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:18,150
<I> we can change the SpatiaLite request</ i>

82
00:05:18,350 --> 00:05:20,251
<I> by introducing a conditional
clause </ i>

83
00:05:20,451 --> 00:05:23,451
<I> to limit the selection to districts
whose name begins with d. </ I>

84
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:28,759
<I> And again, we have to define
the result of the query </ i>

85
00:05:28,959 --> 00:05:31,537
<I> as a new layer to display this
selection of districts </ i>

86
00:05:31,737 --> 00:05:32,730
<I> in the map. </ I>

87
00:05:38,855 --> 00:05:41,815
<I> To retrieve the projection
system of these objects, </ i>

88
00:05:42,015 --> 00:05:45,063
<I> we eliminate the conditional
part of the query </ i>

89
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:51,886
<I> and we add the SRID function
that applies to geometries. </ I>

90
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:56,178
<I> By executing this query,
we see that all our objects, </ i>

91
00:05:56,378 --> 00:06:00,477
<I> or let's say a large part of our 
objects, are in 32740 which is actually </ i>

92
00:06:00,677 --> 00:06:04,902
<I> the UTM 40 South system </ i>

93
00:06:05,102 --> 00:06:08,828
<I> and we see with the DISTINCT 
keyword that the set of objects </ i>

94
00:06:09,028 --> 00:06:11,499
<I> have this same reference system. </ I>

95
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:25,525
<I> The conversion functions, which
also apply </ i>

96
00:06:25,725 --> 00:06:29,473
<I> to the GEOMETRY attribute,
that can transform </ i>

97
00:06:29,673 --> 00:06:34,220
<I> a geometry into a text format 
to make it readable </ i>

98
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:37,420
<I> or on the contrary, in
binary format to store it </ i>

99
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:38,554
<I> so that it takes up 
little space. </ I>

100
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:44,319
<I> These two functions are very
useful to export / import </ i>

101
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:47,515
<I> datasets from one
database to another </ i>

102
00:06:47,727 --> 00:06:49,467
<I> and convert them in
another storage format. </ I>

103
00:06:49,667 --> 00:06:52,176
<I> The syntax is always fairly
simple, </ i>

104
00:06:52,376 --> 00:06:54,624
<I> the SELECT keyword,
the AsText function </ i>

105
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:58,645
<I> with the geometry in brackets,
FROM and the name of the table. </ I>

106
00:07:00,282 --> 00:07:02,814
<I> To illustrate this operation,
we take </ i>

107
00:07:03,014 --> 00:07:07,368
<I> the QGIS SpatiaLite interface </ i>

108
00:07:07,568 --> 00:07:10,911
<I> and we simply write this request </ i>

109
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:15,724
<I>of transformation of the
hotel geometries into text </ i>

110
00:07:15,924 --> 00:07:20,243
<I> and we give an alias
to this column, </ i>

111
00:07:20,443 --> 00:07:24,108
<I> we call it gg, so it comes
from the hotel table </ i>

112
00:07:24,308 --> 00:07:28,191
<I> and we see that our column gg
contains a series of multipoints </ i>

113
00:07:28,391 --> 00:07:30,350
<I> with the coordinates x y. </ I>

114
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:35,844
<I> We can create a table
from these results, </ i>

115
00:07:36,044 --> 00:07:39,821
<I> that we will call table 1,
and we can add this table </ i>

116
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:42,955
<I> in the SpatiaLite database. </ I>

117
00:07:43,155 --> 00:07:47,797
<I> We can consult the objects
of this table. </ I>

118
00:07:47,997 --> 00:07:50,439
<I> We see that we find our
multipoints </ i>

119
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,714
<I> with a primary key that was
added automatically. </ I>

120
00:07:58,677 --> 00:08:03,817
<I> The equivalent function
to transform the geometry </ i>

121
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:10,233
<I> into a binary number allows 
to observe in fact </ i>

122
00:08:10,433 --> 00:08:13,433
<I> that what we create 
is a geometric object </ i>

123
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:18,351
<I> that we will be able 
to use for maps. </ I>

124
00:08:20,989 --> 00:08:24,751
<I> Let's suppose now that we have 
obtained, imported this table </ i>

125
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:29,460
<I> that contains text geometries. </ I>

126
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:32,660
<I> We can use a GeomFromText
function </ i>

127
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:40,173
<I> which allows to
transform these text geometries </ i>

128
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:43,678
<I> into binary geometries, 
so geometric objects </ i>

129
00:08:43,878 --> 00:08:47,622
<I> that we will then be able 
to use to display them in a map. </ I>

130
00:08:57,915 --> 00:09:00,654
<I> A series of functions that
now allows </ i>

131
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:03,240
<I> to recover the
characteristics </ i>

132
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,880
<I> of spatial geometry, starting
with the type of geometry, </ i>

133
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,041
<I> the number of points or the
number of rings </ i>

134
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:13,885
<I> it can contain and its envelope </ i>

135
00:09:14,085 --> 00:09:18,258
<I> so the bounding box,
the rectangle that encompasses </ i>

136
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,636
<I>the geometry. </ I>

137
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:23,351
<I> The syntax is always of
SELECT type, </ i>

138
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:25,955
<I> the function GeometryType
on Envelope </ i>

139
00:09:26,155 --> 00:09:29,155
<I> and the GEOMETRY 
keyword in brackets, </ i>

140
00:09:29,355 --> 00:09:31,560
<I> FROM and the name of the table. </ I>

141
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:36,735
<I> So we illustrate this type
of queries </ i>

142
00:09:36,935 --> 00:09:40,826
<I> with the function that allows
to extract the type of geometry </ i>

143
00:09:41,026 --> 00:09:44,210
<I> of a layer, in this case, we will
focus on the district layer. </ I>

144
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:47,247
<I> and we see that the SQL
syntax here is quite permissive </ i>

145
00:09:47,447 --> 00:09:51,114
<I> since we can simply mention
the GEOMETRY attribute, </ i>

146
00:09:51,314 --> 00:09:53,568
<I> the name of the table,
removing any ambiguity. </ I>

147
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:58,198
<I> With the DISTINCT keyword,
we can check that </ i>

148
00:09:58,398 --> 00:10:00,307
<I> the entire district
layer is composed </ i>

149
00:10:00,507 --> 00:10:01,770
<I> of multipolygons. </ I>

150
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:08,371
<I> If we now replace this extraction

151
00:10:08,596 --> 00:10:10,996
<I>of geometry type by the
Envelope function, </ i>

152
00:10:11,196 --> 00:10:14,196
<I> we see that we create a
series of geometric objects </ i>

153
00:10:14,396 --> 00:10:17,396
<I> and to add these geometric objects
to the map, we must </ i>

154
00:10:17,596 --> 00:10:21,046
<I> make it a GEOMETRY column,
define the table name </ i>

155
00:10:21,258 --> 00:10:23,796
<I> in which we wish to
store the thing, </ i>

156
00:10:23,996 --> 00:10:28,345
<I> define the GEOMETRY field as
containing the geometry </ i>

157
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:30,613
<I> and execute the query. </ I>

158
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:35,259
<I> So this query creates a layer
called On Envelope </ i>

159
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:39,108
<I> and we find the envelopes that
include the different districts </ i>

160
00:10:39,308 --> 00:10:41,494
<I> of the island of Mahé here. </ I>

161
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:55,080
<I> Among the many functions
that return specific </ i>

162
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:57,559
<I> properties of spatial geometries, </ i>

163
00:10:57,759 --> 00:11:00,759
<I> we will start simply
by those returning</ i>

164
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:03,015
<I> the coordinates xy of a point </ i>

165
00:11:03,215 --> 00:11:06,215
<I> with a very simple syntax
of SELECT X type </ i>

166
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:10,342
<I> in brackets, the geometry,
comma Y, the geometry </ i>

167
00:11:10,542 --> 00:11:11,996
<I> if we want to extract the
two coordinates, </ i>

168
00:11:12,196 --> 00:11:13,710
<I> FROM the name of the table. </ I>

169
00:11:15,610 --> 00:11:18,465
<I> This syntax is illustrated
by selecting </ i>

170
00:11:18,665 --> 00:11:24,653
<I> the x and y coordinates
of the Seychelles' hotels. </ i>

171
00:11:27,265 --> 00:11:29,947
<I> So here again, simply the
GEOMETRY keyword, </ i>

172
00:11:30,147 --> 00:11:32,707
<I> the name of the table, removing
any ambiguity. </ I>

173
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:35,746
<I> We see that the result
of the Greek colony </ i>

174
00:11:35,946 --> 00:11:38,946
<I> is in scientific notation
and so we can use </ i>

175
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:43,547
<I> a CastTo function 
towards an integer </ i>

176
00:11:43,747 --> 00:11:50,263
<I> to transform this scientific
notation into an integer number </ i>

177
00:11:50,463 --> 00:11:52,833
<I> to make it more readable. </ I>

178
00:11:54,283 --> 00:11:58,161
<I> Second series of functions
that concern </ i>

179
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:03,097
<I> the polylines more with the extraction
of the initial and the final points </ i>

180
00:12:03,297 --> 00:12:05,223
<I> of the polyline, StartPoint,
EndPoint, </ i>

181
00:12:05,423 --> 00:12:09,231
<I> the length, Length and 
a test to check </ i>

182
00:12:09,431 --> 00:12:12,975
<I> if the polyline is open or
closed </ i>

183
00:12:13,175 --> 00:12:15,144
<I> and possibly a test to
check if it is </ i>

184
00:12:15,344 --> 00:12:19,406
<I> a ring or not,
so if it is part of a polygon. </ I>

185
00:12:19,606 --> 00:12:22,606
<I> The syntax is of
SELECT type, the function </ i>

186
00:12:22,806 --> 00:12:24,919
<I> in brackets the geometry,
FROM the name of the table </ i>

187
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:28,119
<I> as usual with a particularity, </ i>

188
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:31,319
<I> the fact that the length function
that returns the length </ i>

189
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:37,171
<I> of the polyline is preceded
by a capital G in SpatiaLite </ i>

190
00:12:37,371 --> 00:12:40,227
<I> for the simple reason that
the LENGTH keyword </ i>

191
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:44,569
<I> is a reserved word of
SpatiaLite and in QGIS, </ i>

192
00:12:44,769 --> 00:12:47,379
<I> as I said at the beginning,
this function </ i>

193
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:49,664
<I> is written ST for spatial type, </ i>

194
00:12:49,864 --> 00:12:52,864
<I> underlined and then 
the LENGTH keyword. </ I>

195
00:12:53,064 --> 00:12:58,022
<I> As an example of this type of
query, </ i>

196
00:12:58,222 --> 00:13:02,253
<I> we will extract the length
from the road sections </ i>

197
00:13:02,453 --> 00:13:05,149
<I> of the Seychelles' road map. </ I>

198
00:13:05,349 --> 00:13:09,066
<I> And we see that by
executing this request, </ i>

199
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:12,266
<I> we obtain the length in meters </ i>

200
00:13:12,466 --> 00:13:14,469
<I> of these road sections. </ I>

201
00:13:15,144 --> 00:13:18,331
<I> Two functions which now
concern more specifically </ i>

202
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:20,846
<I>the polygons, the Centroid
function </ i>

203
00:13:21,046 --> 00:13:23,311
<I> which returns the
polygon barycenter, </ i>

204
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,906
<I> the center of gravity
of the polygon, </ i>

205
00:13:25,106 --> 00:13:29,134
<I> and the Area function
that returns to its surface. </ I>

206
00:13:29,334 --> 00:13:31,594
<I> The syntax is always the same
with the SELECT keyword, </ i>

207
00:13:31,794 --> 00:13:33,547
<I>the function, the geometry
in brackets, </ i>

208
00:13:33,747 --> 00:13:36,108
<I> the FROM keyword and
the name of the table. </ I>

209
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,304
<I> So in our example here,
we start by </ i>

210
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:47,483
<I> selecting, by extracting the surfaces
of Seychelles' districts. </ I>

211
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:59,273
<I> That's it. So we have again
a notation of scientific type. </ I>

212
00:13:59,473 --> 00:14:02,473
<I> If we now focus on Centroid, </ i>

213
00:14:02,673 --> 00:14:06,103
<I> we obrain geometric
objects </ i>

214
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,933
<I> that we may want to
represent on the map. </ I>

215
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:14,363
<I> So to do this, we must
load the result as a layer </ i>

216
00:14:14,563 --> 00:14:19,643
<I> in QGIS, define the
geometry, the geometry field </ i>

217
00:14:19,843 --> 00:14:21,756
<I> with the GEOMETRY keyword,
give a name to the table </ i>

218
00:14:21,956 --> 00:14:24,756
<I> and make sure that the
geometry field is called GEOMETRY. </ I>

219
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:29,058
<I> By executing this request,
we see that we create </ i>

220
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:30,871
<I> a layer called centroid. </ I>

221
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:33,956
<I> And if we display these
centroid layers, </ i>

222
00:14:34,156 --> 00:14:35,940
<I> we see that we have yellow
dots that appear </ i>

223
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:37,711
<I> in the center of the
Seychelles' districts. </ I>

224
00:14:49,344 --> 00:14:52,414
There you go. In this lesson, we have seen

225
00:14:52,614 --> 00:14:57,884
that we could use the query 
integrated into QGIS 

226
00:14:58,084 --> 00:15:03,124
to select spatial objects based
on conditional queries

227
00:15:03,324 --> 00:15:05,947
that use a SQL-like syntax.

228
00:15:06,147 --> 00:15:10,047
And we also saw that we could use

229
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:14,377
the SQL functions either in SpatiaLite,
we have not seen any example

230
00:15:14,577 --> 00:15:15,894
in PostGIS but it's the same thing,

231
00:15:16,094 --> 00:15:21,315
to extract properties or characteristics
of geometries

232
00:15:21,515 --> 00:15:23,486
which are stored in a database.

233
00:15:23,686 --> 00:15:27,340
So, considering the selection 
functions of geometric objects,

234
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:31,727
the functions which allow
to extract the reference system used,

235
00:15:31,952 --> 00:15:33,425
so the ESPG code,

236
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,500
from the format conversion functions

237
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:40,041
to text or to binary 
to be able to transform,

238
00:15:40,241 --> 00:15:43,241
to graphically retrieve spatial objects,

239
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:47,657
functions which allow
to extract the proper characteristics

240
00:15:47,882 --> 00:15:50,645
of geometries like their type,
their envelope,

241
00:15:50,832 --> 00:15:52,340
things like that and finally,

242
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:54,765
a series of functions that allow
to extract

243
00:15:54,965 --> 00:15:57,965
more numerical characteristics from
space objects,

244
00:15:58,165 --> 00:16:00,881
the coordinates x y, the length of a line

245
00:16:01,081 --> 00:16:03,447
the surface of a point, etc.
