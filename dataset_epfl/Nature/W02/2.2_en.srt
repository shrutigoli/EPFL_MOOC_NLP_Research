00:00:03,262 --> 00:00:07,353
Welcome back <i>Nature, In Code,</i>
we're in Chapter 2, Lecture 2.

2
00:00:07,353 --> 00:00:12,734
We just introduced a few key terms
that we'll use throughout the course.

3
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:17,731
In this video I'd like to introduce
a null model of evolutionary biology

4
00:00:17,731 --> 00:00:20,839
which is called the <i>Hardy-Weinberg</i> model.

5
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:24,067
So what is a null model
and why should we care?

6
00:00:24,767 --> 00:00:29,055
So let me start by introducing 
this idea of a null model.

7
00:00:29,595 --> 00:00:32,614
Null model is a very important idea
in all of science.

8
00:00:33,304 --> 00:00:35,282
Imagine you have some kind of system

9
00:00:35,282 --> 00:00:38,495
and now you're applying
some force to the system,

10
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:42,048
and then later you may observe
that the system changes,

11
00:00:42,048 --> 00:00:46,507
so there is some consequences possibly
of you applying this force.

12
00:00:47,157 --> 00:00:51,512
But how do you in fact know
that the system changed

13
00:00:51,512 --> 00:00:54,533
<i>because</i> you applied this force?

14
00:00:54,533 --> 00:00:56,985
Is it possible that the system 
would have changed,

15
00:00:56,985 --> 00:01:00,692
or now behaves in a way
that it would have anyway,

16
00:01:00,692 --> 00:01:03,220
without you applying this force?

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,489
And so, what you need to do
in order to understand this,

18
00:01:05,489 --> 00:01:07,924
is you need to remove this force,

19
00:01:07,924 --> 00:01:11,394
need to remove all forces of interest

20
00:01:11,394 --> 00:01:15,861
to get to a null model that describes
the system, how it would work

21
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:18,859
without any of the forces 
that you're interested in.

22
00:01:18,859 --> 00:01:22,979
We have four forces, 
as we just discussed in a previous video,

23
00:01:23,809 --> 00:01:29,232
that we now understand,
are major forces to affect evolution

24
00:01:29,232 --> 00:01:33,551
and to affect the composition
and the allele frequencies in populations.

25
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:36,782
And so what we need to do
is we need to ensure

26
00:01:36,782 --> 00:01:40,148
that none of those four forces is acting,

27
00:01:40,148 --> 00:01:42,418
in order to get to our null model.

28
00:01:42,418 --> 00:01:46,894
And this model in evolutionary biology
is in fact a very famous model,

29
00:01:46,894 --> 00:01:50,234
and it's called the <i>Hardy-Weinberg</i> model,

30
00:01:50,234 --> 00:01:55,695
named after the two people
who invented this model,

31
00:01:56,425 --> 00:01:59,207
Hardy and Weinberg, a long time ago.

32
00:01:59,207 --> 00:02:02,742
And so this is a very, 
very simplified model of the world,

33
00:02:02,742 --> 00:02:05,769
but it helps us understand 
what would happen

34
00:02:05,769 --> 00:02:07,818
if nothing happens, so to speak.

35
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:11,418
What does the world look like
from a population genetic perspective

36
00:02:11,418 --> 00:02:14,689
if none of those four forces is acting?

37
00:02:14,689 --> 00:02:17,868
So you open up any textbook 
on population genetics

38
00:02:17,868 --> 00:02:21,278
or evolutionary biology, Hardy-Weinberg 
is right there at the beginning

39
00:02:21,278 --> 00:02:25,504
because we need to understand what happens
without any of those four forces,

40
00:02:25,504 --> 00:02:29,688
and then we can later 
slowly add the forces one by one,

41
00:02:29,688 --> 00:02:33,349
either in combination or as single forces,

42
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:38,468
and then we can understand much better
what happens <i>because</i> of those forces.

43
00:02:38,468 --> 00:02:41,242
So we'll implement this 
very shortly in JavaScript.

44
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:44,345
This is our null model 
where we begin from.

45
00:02:45,725 --> 00:02:51,163
From a biological perspective, 
what we'll do is we'll of course

46
00:02:51,163 --> 00:02:54,911
use this concept of passing on 
genetic material

47
00:02:54,911 --> 00:02:57,773
throughout the generations--

48
00:02:57,773 --> 00:02:58,852
this is DNA--

49
00:02:59,272 --> 00:03:02,582
and we also assume

50
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:05,882
a model that is typically 
found in animals,

51
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:09,454
and that is that of diploid individuals.

52
00:03:09,454 --> 00:03:15,321
So if you don't recall what this is
from biology class back in school--

53
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:21,095
in fact, most animals are <i>diploid, </i>
which means that in each of your cells,

54
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:24,844
in fact, not only have one copy 
of your genetic material,

55
00:03:24,844 --> 00:03:28,637
but <i>two</i> copies, 
and hence the word diploid.

56
00:03:29,367 --> 00:03:31,926
And this is true for almost all animals.

57
00:03:31,926 --> 00:03:37,228
There are some cells 
and also some animals that are haploid,

58
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:40,177
and plants are in fact very fascinating

59
00:03:40,177 --> 00:03:45,209
because they have even more complex cells,
and more complex genetic systems

60
00:03:45,209 --> 00:03:47,949
where you have three, four, 
or even more copies,

61
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:53,759
but for the context of this course,
we'll focus on humans or animals,

62
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:56,894
and we'll focus on diploid systems.

63
00:03:57,674 --> 00:04:00,320
It turns out that even though

64
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,230
that practically 
all of your cells are diploid,

65
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,306
some of them are actually haploid
and this is really important

66
00:04:06,306 --> 00:04:10,406
from an evolutionary perspective,
because it is those cells

67
00:04:10,406 --> 00:04:13,583
that are actually used
for sexual reproduction.

68
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:16,241
So imagine a human body--

69
00:04:16,241 --> 00:04:18,900
and I'm going to obviously 
simplify things dramatically--

70
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:23,683
but a bunch of cells, 
all of these cells are diploid,

71
00:04:23,683 --> 00:04:26,333
so have two copies 
of the genetic material.

72
00:04:27,513 --> 00:04:31,438
Through a process 
that is called <i>meiosis--</i>

73
00:04:31,988 --> 00:04:34,436
this isn't that important, 
but it's a process,

74
00:04:34,436 --> 00:04:37,374
a very important process called meiosis--

75
00:04:37,374 --> 00:04:41,724
these haploid cells are created,
that have only one copy.

76
00:04:41,727 --> 00:04:43,798
Okay, of course multiple ones.

77
00:04:44,758 --> 00:04:48,826
And we call these haploid cells, <i>gametes.</i>

78
00:04:51,676 --> 00:04:54,286
And these are used 
for sexual reproduction.

79
00:04:54,286 --> 00:04:57,587
So let's say you have 
another individual over here

80
00:04:57,587 --> 00:05:00,046
that's of course also diploid.

81
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:05,952
Also each cells have two copies
of the genetic material.

82
00:05:05,952 --> 00:05:09,476
Same thing, through a process 
called meiosis,

83
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:13,264
this individual produces gametes,
which are haploid.

84
00:05:14,604 --> 00:05:19,857
And now these two individuals 
can engage in sexual reproduction,

85
00:05:19,857 --> 00:05:23,129
each of them providing one gamete.

86
00:05:24,069 --> 00:05:25,939
So you pick one gamete here,

87
00:05:25,939 --> 00:05:27,881
and you pick one gamete here,

88
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:31,181
and these then fuse

89
00:05:31,181 --> 00:05:36,640
and create the first cell
of a new individual, a new generation.

90
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,250
And this new cell here, 
is called a <i>zygote,</i>

91
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,403
and because it fused those haploid cells,

92
00:05:44,403 --> 00:05:47,943
this cell is now again diploid.

93
00:05:48,433 --> 00:05:51,393
And so now through regular development,

94
00:05:51,393 --> 00:05:54,573
from this first single cell

95
00:05:54,573 --> 00:05:56,383
a new body will be formed,

96
00:05:56,383 --> 00:05:59,809
that will of course be composed 
of many, many cells,

97
00:05:59,809 --> 00:06:03,084
and that will be all diploid cells.

98
00:06:05,344 --> 00:06:10,402
And so the model that we're using here
is that you have here,

99
00:06:10,402 --> 00:06:13,816
the gamete coming from this individual,

100
00:06:13,816 --> 00:06:15,806
so this would be this copy here,

101
00:06:15,806 --> 00:06:18,454
and you have the gamete here 
coming from this individual,

102
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:20,455
that would be this copy here.

103
00:06:20,905 --> 00:06:25,408
And, by the way, in males 
we call these gametes, <i>sperm cells,</i>

104
00:06:25,408 --> 00:06:28,339
and in females 
we call these gametes, <i>eggs.</i>

105
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:31,536
And then these cells here in development,

106
00:06:31,536 --> 00:06:35,018
would obviously 
just be copies of that cell.

107
00:06:35,938 --> 00:06:38,045
But it's important for the model,

108
00:06:38,045 --> 00:06:42,495
to be reminded 
of this underlying basic biology

109
00:06:42,495 --> 00:06:47,100
that you have one copy
of your genetic material

110
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,709
from your father, 
and one copy from your mother.

111
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:56,421
In reality here, thousands or, in fact,
tens of thousands of genes

112
00:06:56,421 --> 00:07:00,179
are being passed on 
from one generation to the next.

113
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:05,136
We'll simplify things quite a bit 
in order to keep things trackable.

114
00:07:05,516 --> 00:07:09,413
What we'll do is we'll focus 
on one single gene.

115
00:07:09,933 --> 00:07:11,632
Let's call this the "A" gene.

116
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:16,192
And the simplest model we can think of
in terms of an interesting model

117
00:07:16,192 --> 00:07:20,271
is a gene that actually comes 
in two versions,

118
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:27,085
namely, allele A1 and allele A2.

119
00:07:28,675 --> 00:07:32,493
So if we're interested in 
a change in allele frequencies,

120
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:35,555
we need at least two alleles
otherwise if you only have one allele,

121
00:07:35,555 --> 00:07:38,635
that allele is always going to be 
at the 100% and nothing will ever change.

122
00:07:38,635 --> 00:07:42,712
But this is the simplest model
we can come up with.

123
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:47,441
If we have two alleles,
and we're talking about diploid cells,

124
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:50,643
that means we can package those alleles

125
00:07:50,643 --> 00:07:54,273
into a cell in three different ways:

126
00:07:54,273 --> 00:07:59,764
either we can say both copies are A1 A1;

127
00:07:59,764 --> 00:08:05,014
or we can say both copies are A2 A2;

128
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:10,990
or we can say the intermediary,
one copy's A1 and the other copy is A2.

129
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,439
And so these two types are in fact
called <i>homozygous,</i>

130
00:08:17,469 --> 00:08:20,919
because they both have the same copy--

131
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:23,239
in this case A1, this case A2--

132
00:08:23,239 --> 00:08:25,401
the same type of allele.

133
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:30,219
These cells are called <i>heterozygous</i>

134
00:08:30,219 --> 00:08:32,459
because they have different types,

135
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:35,571
and in this case they have,
one copy's the A1 allele,

136
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:38,143
and the other copy is the A2 allele.

137
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:42,050
So these are important terms 
that we'll use throughout the course.

138
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:44,590
Now let's think about an example.

139
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:50,864
Let's say, there's a population 
of 100 individuals that you study.

140
00:08:51,324 --> 00:08:54,195
You can now go in and you can analyze

141
00:08:54,195 --> 00:08:56,855
the genetic makeup of that population.

142
00:08:56,855 --> 00:09:00,136
And you can basically count 
how many of those individuals

143
00:09:00,136 --> 00:09:02,657
are of one of those three types.

144
00:09:02,657 --> 00:09:07,363
Now let's say you find 
the following genotypes--

145
00:09:07,363 --> 00:09:12,565
so these three sets of alleles 
are called <i>genotypes.</i>

146
00:09:12,565 --> 00:09:18,779
Let's say you find, 
of the A1 A1 you find 15 inidividuals,

147
00:09:19,229 --> 00:09:24,635
of the A1 A2 you find, 
let's say, 50 individuals,

148
00:09:24,635 --> 00:09:29,643
and of the A2 A2 genotype, you find 35.

149
00:09:30,023 --> 00:09:35,310
So those, of course, add up 
to 100 individuals,

150
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:38,319
and so in percentage points, 
the frequencies--

151
00:09:38,319 --> 00:09:41,753
because you have exactly 100 individuals, 
that's easy to calculate--

152
00:09:41,753 --> 00:09:46,560
are 15%, 50% and 35%.

153
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:49,128
So these are your genotype frequencies

154
00:09:49,898 --> 00:09:52,509
at the moment where you measured
this population.

155
00:09:53,189 --> 00:09:57,297
Now we can in fact deduce 
from these numbers

156
00:09:57,297 --> 00:10:00,677
the allele frequencies.

157
00:10:00,677 --> 00:10:02,087
How do we do that?

158
00:10:03,242 --> 00:10:07,490
Well, let's take a look at these numbers.
We have 15 individuals,

159
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:13,307
we have 50 individuals of A1 A2,

160
00:10:13,657 --> 00:10:18,645
and finally we have 
35 individuals of A2 A2.

161
00:10:18,645 --> 00:10:23,918
And for simplicity we now just consider
these individuals to be a single cell.

162
00:10:24,268 --> 00:10:26,061
So we can actually go in--

163
00:10:26,061 --> 00:10:29,502
a single cell with one gene 
is an extremely simplified world--

164
00:10:29,502 --> 00:10:33,803
but we can now go in and actually count
the alleles that we have.

165
00:10:33,803 --> 00:10:35,711
So how many alleles do we have here?

166
00:10:35,711 --> 00:10:41,658
Well, we have 15 individuals 
that have two copies of the A1 allele,

167
00:10:41,658 --> 00:10:47,519
so that means we have 30 A1 alleles here.

168
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:52,058
Here, these individuals, A1 A2,

169
00:10:52,058 --> 00:10:56,608
they provide 50 A1 alleles,

170
00:10:56,608 --> 00:11:02,061
but they also provide 50 A2 alleles.

171
00:11:02,371 --> 00:11:04,461
Okay, they're alleles.

172
00:11:04,461 --> 00:11:06,681
And then these guys down here,

173
00:11:06,681 --> 00:11:11,071
35 individuals
each have two copies of the A2 allele,

174
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:15,713
so they provide 70 A2 alleles.

175
00:11:17,013 --> 00:11:22,753
And now if you add those up, 
here we have, in fact, 80 A1 alleles,

176
00:11:23,173 --> 00:11:27,968
and here we have 120 A2 alleles.

177
00:11:27,968 --> 00:11:31,108
If you sum those up 
you get in total 200 alleles,

178
00:11:31,108 --> 00:11:32,762
and that's exactly as it should be

179
00:11:32,762 --> 00:11:36,595
because remember we have 100 individuals.

180
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,185
Those individuals are diploid,

181
00:11:38,185 --> 00:11:41,706
so they have two sets 
of the genetic material each,

182
00:11:41,706 --> 00:11:45,487
so there are 200 alleles in this model.

183
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:49,799
And now because we know 
80 out of 200 are A1,

184
00:11:49,799 --> 00:11:54,412
that means our allele frequency 
for the A1 is 40%,

185
00:11:54,412 --> 00:12:00,263
and our allele frequency of A2 
is 120 by 200, that's 60%.

186
00:12:00,263 --> 00:12:02,880
So those are now our allele frequencies.

187
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:05,690
So here we have genotype frequencies,

188
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:09,040
and here we have our allele frequencies.

189
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,901
So this is the population 
the way we currently observe it.

190
00:12:12,901 --> 00:12:18,428
What we want to understand next
is if we now go to the next generation,

191
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:22,209
how do these frequencies change?

192
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:24,729
So this concludes Chapter 2, Lecture 2.

193
00:12:24,729 --> 00:12:28,157
I'll see you in the next video 
of Chapter 2, Lecture 3.
