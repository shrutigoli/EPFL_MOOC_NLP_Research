1
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,760
Welcome back. <i>Nature, in Code</i>. 
We're in Chapter 2, Lecture 4,

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,680
and in this video, 
we'll finally get coding.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,130
So, just to recap,

4
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:14,210
why is it that we're using 
JavaScript in this course?

5
00:00:14,210 --> 00:00:16,450
So there's a couple of reasons.

6
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,160
JavaScript being very fast,

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,660
JavaScript being 
an easy language to learn, in my view.

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,150
But I think one of the most important 
aspects about JavaScript

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,010
is that it runs in every browser

10
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:31,500
and that's a real asset 
because all you need to do

11
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,990
is you need to open up a text editor,

12
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:36,220
you can start writing 
a JavaScript document

13
00:00:36,220 --> 00:00:39,430
then save that 
and load it up in any browser.

14
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,720
And, that's really powerful 
because it means

15
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,160
there's nothing you need to install.

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,170
And, even more importantly,
right now, there are billions,

17
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,730
literally, billions of devices 
that can run your code

18
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:53,770
because they come with a browser,

19
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,830
and browsers always 
have JavaScript pre-installed.

20
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:00,640
And so, to me, 
that's a great, great asset,

21
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,250
and that's why we're using JavaScript.

22
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,410
So let's get coding.

23
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:08,900
So the first thing we need to do
is open up any web page

24
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,990
of your choice.

25
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,280
I'm actually here 
in the Google Sign In page

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,450
and let me just click here 
on About Google.

27
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:24,050
That gives us a more, sort of, 
average-looking web page.

28
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:27,170
It's not a sign-in form, 
but it has images,

29
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:30,700
it has links, it has texts, 
and so on,

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:34,450
your prototypical web page, here.

31
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:37,040
Now, how does this work?

32
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,450
What is the code behind this page,

33
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:43,250
and how does the browser 
know what to do with it?

34
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:46,680
Well, it turns out that, 
every time you enter an address here,

35
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,410
in the URL bar, and then hit <i>Enter</i>,

36
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,410
or you actually click on a link,
as I just did,

37
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:57,110
then a request is being made

38
00:01:57,110 --> 00:01:59,890
for a particular HTML document.

39
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:03,390
And so, your browser 
makes this request,

40
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:06,490
and eventually, a machine somewhere 
on the internet called a <i>server</i>,

41
00:02:06,490 --> 00:02:08,180
returns that document,

42
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:12,100
and then your browser 
renders that document for you.

43
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:15,500
So let's take a look what this looks like,
actually, behind the scenes.

44
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,290
So here, in Chrome,

45
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:22,500
you can go to
<i>View &gt; Developer &gt; View Source</i>.

46
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:27,420
Now, you should have a similar menu 
in the browser that you may be using,

47
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,670
if you're not using Chrome.

48
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:33,190
The alternative, is that most browsers 
have this functionality

49
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,410
where you can <i>Right-Click</i> on the document,

50
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:40,410
and then here, say, <i>View Page Source</i>.

51
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:44,490
But, yeah, all browsers 
come with that functionality built in,

52
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:49,400
so in Chrome it's 
<i>View &gt; Developer &gt; View Source</i>.

53
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,180
And here, were actually 
viewing the source,

54
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,670
an HTML source of that document.

55
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:59,710
And, if you scroll through this document,
you can see a bit of a structure here.

56
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:05,860
This structure is, in fact, HTML.
<i>HTML</i> stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

57
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:10,100
Now, we're not gonna learn 
HTML in this course.

58
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:14,450
We're just gonna learn 
the very, very basics that we need.

59
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:17,180
The first thing to notice 
is that the first line here,

60
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:20,170
defines that this is a document HTML.

61
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:22,410
This is not actually necessary,

62
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:28,400
but it's a convention and we're 
gonna use it throughout the course.

63
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,280
And then you have, 
you can see these brackets here.

64
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,110
What are those?

65
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:36,160
Well, those are actually 
so-called <i>HTML tags</i>,

66
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:42,010
and almost all HTML tags 
have the following structure:

67
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,420
There's a word that defines the tag.
So this, for example, is the <i>head</i> tag.

68
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:51,660
And then, many of those actually contain 
other tags or other type of content

69
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,620
and then, eventually, 
that tag gets closed.

70
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:59,050
So the <i>head</i> tag gets closed, 
down here, with this forward slash.

71
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,950
And so, this is a typical example

72
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:03,680
and you will be able to see this 
throughout these documents

73
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,620
that some tags contain other tags, 
which contain other tags,

74
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,810
and then, eventually, 
those tags get closed.

75
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:16,200
So this is a type of <i>nesting</i>
that HTML allows.

76
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,690
Now, we won't used that heavily,

77
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,750
but it's just generally 
important to know that.

78
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:25,850
Now, where is the JavaScript?

79
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,400
So, JavaScript is actually used 
quite heavily on this page,

80
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,970
which may be surprising.

81
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:35,010
But, the most obvious 
use of JavaScript is down here.

82
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:38,470
And, by the way, 
don't get scared of this, okay?

83
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,600
This is very complicated JavaScript code.

84
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:46,170
I look at this code, and I frankly 
have no clue what this code is doing.

85
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,240
I could, of course, analyze it

86
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,990
and I would eventually 
understand what it is,

87
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:52,930
but this is extremely <i>terse</i> code.

88
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:56,180
And it's <i>terse</i> not so that 
it's easy to read for us,

89
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,220
but so that it doesn't consume 
a lot of bandwidth.

90
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,430
But in any case, the point being,
don't get scared away by this.

91
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:07,230
We'll write much clearer 
and much more beautiful code.

92
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:11,500
Not because Google couldn't do this,

93
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:15,960
but because we are not actually 
constrained by bandwidth, at this point.

94
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:18,830
But, in any case, this is JavaScript code.

95
00:05:18,830 --> 00:05:23,000
So, you'll also note that,
here's a <i>script</i> tag that's opening up

96
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,550
and then it's closing down here.

97
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:28,030
Actually, down here, 
you see something else.

98
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:30,720
You see a <i>script</i> tag opening and closing,

99
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,400
but there's no JavaScript code within,

100
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,635
but there's some reference to a file.

101
00:05:36,635 --> 00:05:39,830
And that's, actually, 
also a JavaScript file here,

102
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:44,080
that will be loaded into this document.

103
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,410
We'll use that technology 
extremely rarely.

104
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:52,780
We'll, usually, just write straight 
into the document, as we do here.

105
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,920
By the way, up here, 
there's a bit more JavaScript.

106
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,430
Here's two other files that are loaded.

107
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,110
And then, if we go back to the top,

108
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:03,660
here's a single line of JavaScript

109
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:08,510
that's written right into 
this document, here.

110
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:12,410
And then, we have another line,
for example, here,

111
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,350
and you'll note again, the <i>script</i> tag,
and then the <i>/script</i>.

112
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:18,560
Actually, some more 
JavaScript here, again,

113
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,730
loaded from an external file.

114
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:25,130
The point being, 
there's quite a bit of JavaScript

115
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:30,200
all over the map here, 
and that's a very typical example.

116
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,680
So, in order to do this ourselves,

117
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:36,160
we now need to write 
our first HTML document,

118
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,000
and in that document, 
we'll write our first line of JavaScript.

119
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:43,390
Now, in order to do that, 
we need a text editor.

120
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:48,150
I'm using, here, 
a program called TextWrangler.

121
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,140
I quite like it. It's free.

122
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:56,660
It has a lot of functionality,
but it's not too complicated to use.

123
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,910
But you can use 
any text editor that you want,

124
00:06:59,910 --> 00:07:03,990
whether it's free, or whether 
you're already using one that you bought.

125
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:09,650
It's really up to you, as long 
as it's easy for you to work with.

126
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:13,400
And for me, TextWrangler 
is very easy to work with.

127
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,970
Also, your particular setting 
may look different,

128
00:07:15,970 --> 00:07:18,420
you may have a white background.

129
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:21,190
I'm using this slightly darker theme here,

130
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,460
but you can use any theme,
any look that that you want.

131
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:25,710
This is really not the point.

132
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:30,960
The point is that you have a text editor
that you feel comfortable working with.

133
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:34,000
If you're on a Mac, 
I recommend TextWrangler.

134
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,550
It's a free tool and it's pretty nice.

135
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,150
All right, so let's get started.

136
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,670
Let's write our first document

137
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,930
and I'm gonna go with convention here,

138
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:48,780
and I'm gonna start with this <i>DOCTYPE html</i>.

139
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,730
Whoops, I should actually write
<i>DOCTYPE</i>, not <i>SOCTYPE</i>.

140
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:56,190
Okay, <i>DOCTYPE html</i>,

141
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:00,650
a line that indicates to the browser
that is an HTML document.

142
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:04,160
But again, actually, 
the code would work without this,

143
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,420
but I'm just gonna go 
with convention here, and be nice.

144
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:11,400
Good. Then, an HTML document

145
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:16,160
is almost always contained 
by this <i>HTML</i> tag.

146
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,970
So I'm gonna write this <i>HTML</i> tag,
and then I'm gonna close it again.

147
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:25,470
And now, within this tag here, 
I'm now gonna create my HTML page.

148
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:30,010
Another thing that's typically done 
is that an HTML page

149
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:35,400
is programmatically structured 
in two parts: a <i>head</i> and a <i>body</i>.

150
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:37,820
So I'm gonna go ahead 
and create these two tags.

151
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:39,660
Okay, there's the <i>head</i> tag--

152
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:41,520
you may have seen this before--

153
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,630
and then, <i>/head</i>,
I'm gonna close this right away.

154
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:48,170
And then, the so-called <i>body</i> tag,

155
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,560
which I'm also gonna open and close--

156
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,230
whoops--
slash, close, right away.

157
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,440
And, by the way, that's just something 
I've gotten used to over the years.

158
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:02,410
When I open a tag, I immediately close it
so I don't forget it later on.

159
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,660
Okay, so another thing I'm gonna do now,

160
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:07,480
is I'm actually gonna 
indent those two tags

161
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,700
and here in TextWrangler,
I'm using the <i>Tab</i>.

162
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:14,230
You can also just 
use <i>Space</i>, as you wish.

163
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:18,340
And, you know, depending 
on your text editor a little bit.

164
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,160
So, what is this? Is this necessary?

165
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,940
No, this is not theoretically necessary.

166
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,410
In fact, you could have 
an entire HTML document on a single line,

167
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,930
but it would be very hard to read.

168
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:32,630
And as we've seen before--

169
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:36,910
Actually, if we go back 
to this <i>source code</i> here,

170
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:40,970
you can see that Google, itself,
does this indentation, okay,

171
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:42,560
and that just makes it easier.

172
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,540
You can, kind of, 
understand the level of nesting.

173
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:51,590
You can understand that this <i>div</i> class,
this <i>div</i> tag, sorry, closes here

174
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:55,900
and this one closes here, 
and this one closes here,

175
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,740
and this one corresponds to this one.

176
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:02,460
So, it just makes things 
much easier to understand, visually.

177
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:06,720
But you could, in principle,
have his entire HTML document

178
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,710
on one single line,

179
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:12,830
but it will be a complete 
nightmare to work with.

180
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,230
All right, let me go back to the text editor.

181
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,650
So, here we have the <i>head</i>
and we have the <i>body</i> tag.

182
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,000
So what are those for?

183
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,300
Well, normally, 
in the head,

184
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:27,400
you have all kinds of information 
about the document,

185
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,620
like the title, maybe, 
what is this document about,

186
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:33,680
some keywords, 
things like that.

187
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:37,860
It's also quite typical to put 
the JavaScript code in here

188
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:40,640
and we'll do this quite a lot.

189
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,960
What's the <i>body</i> tag for?

190
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,670
Well, the body typically contains

191
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:48,800
all those tags that are actually 
used to show to render content

192
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,690
on a web page.

193
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:55,510
So the visual things, those would 
typically be part of the body.

194
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:59,610
And very typically, the body 
is actually 90%, or even more,

195
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,430
of all your HTML code.

196
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:05,880
In our case, that's not normally 
what we're gonna do.

197
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,730
Because we're learning JavaScript here,

198
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:12,080
most of our code will be JavaScript code,
and they will be here, in the head.

199
00:11:12,550 --> 00:11:18,370
So, I'm gonna go ahead 
and add a little bit of JavaScript here.

200
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:21,050
Actually, before I do that,
let's add something to the body,

201
00:11:21,050 --> 00:11:22,160
just to be sure, okay?

202
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,630
So let's just write: "Hello World."

203
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:32,730
and then save the document and see 
what this actually looks like.

204
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:36,210
So we're gonna go ahead 
and we're gonna save this document,

205
00:11:36,210 --> 00:11:39,450
and you can save this 
wherever you want to.

206
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,660
I'm gonna save this here in a folder 
that I prepared already,

207
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,640
called <i>code examples</i>.

208
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,430
You can save it wherever you want 
on your machine,

209
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:50,680
just remember where you saved it.

210
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,280
And I'm gonna call this <i>first_example</i>.

211
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:01,010
And then, be sure to end this with <i>.html</i>,
or <i>.htm</i> is also an option,

212
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:02,810
but I'm gonna use <i>.html</i>.

213
00:12:03,670 --> 00:12:08,010
Okay. I'm gonna save it,
and now, two things happened.

214
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:12,190
First of all, we saved the document, 
and we'll open this in a second.

215
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:13,460
The other thing that happen here,

216
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,660
because I was using 
this <i>.html</i> ending for the file name,

217
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,960
TextWrangler automatically recognized 
that this is now an HTML file

218
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:25,750
and it color-coded things accordingly.

219
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:27,750
So here, the way I have set this up,

220
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,930
you can see that this first line 
here is coded in red,

221
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:34,670
and then the proper tags 
are coded in kind of a gray,

222
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:38,430
and then, text is in white.

223
00:12:38,430 --> 00:12:41,220
Again, this may look different for you,

224
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:45,260
and this is why I actually 
like to use a proper editor

225
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:51,050
because this color syntax 
really helps you with code,

226
00:12:51,050 --> 00:12:54,970
especially when your code 
gets more complicated. Okay.

227
00:12:54,970 --> 00:13:00,280
So, we're gonna go over to the browser
and we're now gonna open this document.

228
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,170
So I'm gonna close all of this 
and just leave one open.

229
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,560
And I'm now gonna go to <i>Open File</i>.

230
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,360
And again, this maybe somewhere different 
depending on which browser you use,

231
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,230
but I'm confident you'll manage
to open a file in your browser.

232
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:20,560
So just find an <i>Open</i> or <i>Open File</i>
somewhere in your browser.

233
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,710
Here in Chrome, it's right here 
under <i>File &gt; Open File</i>.

234
00:13:23,710 --> 00:13:28,240
And then go to the <i>code examples</i>, 
<i>first_example</i> here,

235
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,610
and then <i>Open</i> the file.

236
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,240
And so, what you can see here

237
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:38,240
is the location on my machine
where this is stored,

238
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,680
This will, obviously, 
look slightly different for you,

239
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,590
but what you should 
see here is this Hello World.

240
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,670
And again, it may look 
a little bit different

241
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:49,870
depending on your browser settings,

242
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,140
but you should see nothing else 
other than this Hello World.

243
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:56,130
So, if that worked, 
then congratulations.

244
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,930
You now, basically, 
created your first HTML file.

245
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,750
So let's go back to that file.

246
00:14:02,770 --> 00:14:05,170
All right. Here we are,
back to that file.

247
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:06,420
Okay, so this works.

248
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,410
Now, what we're gonna do is,

249
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,420
we're gonna do something 
slightly different,

250
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,960
and we'll get to the point, 
which is writing JavaScript code.

251
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:17,160
So, I'm gonna add a <i>script</i> tag here.

252
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:23,690
And again, because the <i>script</i> tag
is nested within the <i>head</i> tag,

253
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:26,730
I am indenting it a little bit.

254
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:30,620
You don't have to, 
but I find it more visually pleasing.

255
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,720
All right. So now, I'm actually 
gonna write JavaScript.

256
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:38,940
So, if you're at this stage,

257
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:42,200
please follow me in typing the following:

258
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,930
<i>console.log</i>

259
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,360
open parentheses

260
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,490
double quotes

261
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:56,650
Hello World from JavaScript.

262
00:14:57,450 --> 00:14:58,590
Okay.

263
00:14:58,590 --> 00:14:59,840
Double quotes again,

264
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:04,480
closing of parentheses,
and then semicolon.

265
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,650
And again, don't worry.

266
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:09,770
We'll walk through this line 
and many other lines

267
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:14,640
and you'll understand 
exactly what's what, shortly.

268
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,150
For now, just write this line:

269
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:18,870
<i>console.log</i>

270
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,430
opening parentheses,
and then in quotes,

271
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:23,610
Hello World from JavaScript,

272
00:15:23,610 --> 00:15:27,980
then close the parentheses, 
and a semicolon at the end of the line.

273
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:30,630
If you've done that, 
save your file.

274
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:34,400
Again, just go to <i>File &gt; Save</i>.

275
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:39,230
Or, you can also use a keyboard shortcut,
which I'm actually gonna do from now on.

276
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:43,000
Okay, I'm just gonna say,
I'm gonna save the file,

277
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,620
and then you can trust me 
that I actually saved the file.

278
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,930
All right. Now, let's go over to the browser.

279
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:52,390
This document here is still open.
That's great.

280
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:55,390
So now what we can do 
is reload the document.

281
00:15:55,390 --> 00:15:56,840
There's many ways to do this.

282
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:59,720
You can either click 
on this <i>Reload Arrow</i> here,

283
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,900
and again, this may look differently 
depending on which browser you're using.

284
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:08,190
You can go to <i>File</i>--
I think it is <i>File</i>--

285
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:09,540
and then...

286
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:15,480
Is it <i>View</i>? <i>Reload</i>. 
It's under <i>View &gt; Reload This Page</i>.

287
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,620
And you can tell from my uncertainty 
that I never do it like this

288
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:24,620
because there's, in fact, 
a really handy shortcut

289
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:29,150
that I think is the same in every browser,
which is <i>Command+R</i>.

290
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:33,110
And again, when I say, 
okay, I gonna reload the page,

291
00:16:33,110 --> 00:16:34,850
I'm not gonna go through the menu here,

292
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:38,250
I'm just gonna actually 
reload it with the shortcut.

293
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:40,410
Okay, so I reloaded the document

294
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:41,960
and I'm reloading this 
a couple of times here,

295
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,570
but nothing seems to be happening.

296
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:45,880
Why is that?

297
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,830
Well, if we go back to the code,

298
00:16:49,030 --> 00:16:51,660
what we'll actually see here is that--

299
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:53,410
what's happening here is I'm--

300
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:56,770
This is a <i>string</i>, okay,
a set of characters,

301
00:16:57,650 --> 00:17:02,680
and I'm logging this, or outputting it,
into the so-called console.

302
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,770
Okay?

303
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:06,740
And, what you see here, 
over in the browser.

304
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,660
this whole thing here, 
the browser window,

305
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:10,400
that's not the console.

306
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,150
The console is actually hidden,

307
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:16,430
and you would need to go to

308
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:22,230
<i>View</i> &gt; Developer &gt; JavaScript Console*,
in Chrome.

309
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:26,410
Again, in your browser,
this will look slightly differently

310
00:17:26,410 --> 00:17:28,120
if you're not using Chrome.

311
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,920
And, it's probably in a similar setting

312
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:34,710
somewhere in the menu, in <i>View</i>.

313
00:17:34,710 --> 00:17:38,190
You can also search the internet
if you're not sure,

314
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:40,970
but I'm confident you'll find it.

315
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:45,320
If you're on Chrome,
it's <i>View &gt; Developer &gt; JavaScript Console</i>.

316
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,640
Now, if I click on this,
what happens is over here,

317
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,180
the console opened.

318
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:53,420
You can see here, it says <i>Console</i>
and it's underlined,

319
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:54,790
so we're in the console.

320
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:58,480
And indeed, here is our text 
that we logged,

321
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:02,130
or that we outputted into the console,

322
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,830
which is called 
Hello World from JavaScript.

323
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:06,330
So, indeed, this worked.

324
00:18:06,330 --> 00:18:11,240
Now, if you, in your browser,
see this line in the console,

325
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,710
then congratulations.

326
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,820
What you just did is to write 
your first line of JavaScript code.

327
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:21,530
So again, congrats to this achievement.

328
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:25,660
You saved and created an HTML document

329
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:29,800
with some JavaScript 
embedded in the HTML document.

330
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:32,920
And then, if everything worked,
you should have seen this line:

331
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,660
Hello World from JavaScript.

332
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,530
If you managed to do that, great.

333
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:41,760
There's now nothing in the way 
between you and JavaScript.

334
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:46,760
And in the next video, 
we'll use this type of programming

335
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,460
to implement what we learned 
in the earlier videos of this chapter,

336
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:55,460
which is to implement 
the Hardy-Weinberg principle,

337
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,640
in JavaScript

338
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,020
I'll see you in the next video.
