00:00:03,690 --> 00:00:05,650
Welcome to <i>Nature, In Code</i>.

2
00:00:05,650 --> 00:00:09,170
This is Chapter 2, and this is Lecture 1.

3
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:12,510
In this lecture, I'll introduce 
a few key terms

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,190
that we'll use throughout the course.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:18,970
In the following few videos,
we'll implement a simple model,

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:20,410
and then we get coding.

7
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:23,160
I know you came here to learn how to code,

8
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,220
and we will learn 
how to code in this course,

9
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,770
but in the first few videos,

10
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:31,690
it's important that we get 
the basics sorted out.

11
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,670
So the first thing I'd like to do,

12
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:37,650
is to define a key term
that we'll use throughout the course,

13
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:39,150
and that is evolution.

14
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:44,740
Now, you may have heard of evolution,

15
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,830
and you may have ideas 
about evolution and what this is,

16
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,940
but we're a pretty quantitative 
course here, since we're coding.

17
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:55,950
And so, for the purpose of our course,

18
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:00,130
we're gonna define <i>evolution</i> 
as follows, which is,

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:06,010
the change in allele frequencies

20
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:09,580
(writing)

21
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,750
in a population,

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,200
over time.

23
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,270
Now, let's repeat this.

24
00:01:21,940 --> 00:01:26,690
The change in allele frequencies 
in a population, over time.

25
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:30,150
Now, if that doesn't make sense 
to you right now, don't worry.

26
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,700
It will after this video, 
certainly, after this course.

27
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:39,390
But this is the working definition 
that we'll use throughout the course.

28
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,310
So, in order to understand this,

29
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,530
most of you may have not heard this term.

30
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,950
It's clear what a change is,
it's clear what a population is,

31
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:50,930
it's clear over time means,

32
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:53,490
but what on Earth are these alleles?

33
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,430
And so, that's actually 
a very important concept

34
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,360
because we'll keep talking 
about alleles throughout the course.

35
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,940
So, you probably know 
that the genetic information of all life

36
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:11,000
is stored in this molecule,
which is called <i>DNA</i>.

37
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:16,180
There's a variant of it, RNA,
but details don't matter right now.

38
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:19,170
DNA stores information

39
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:25,990
and stretches of this molecule
are called <i>genes</i>,

40
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:30,980
and these are the stretches 
that encode information

41
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:33,040
that can be translated into proteins.

42
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,400
These proteins can then create cells,

43
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,800
the cells create tissues, organs, 
and, ultimately, individuals.

44
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:48,390
But, if we were to transmit 
this genetic information

45
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:53,320
from generation to generation, unchanged,

46
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,420
and if nothing would 
ever change over time,

47
00:02:57,450 --> 00:03:00,920
all of us would have the exact same genes,

48
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,390
then that would be quite a boring world

49
00:03:03,390 --> 00:03:07,930
and the world would not 
be as diverse as it currently is,

50
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:10,180
so something else has to be there.

51
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,980
And what this is is that genes 
don't just come in one version,

52
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:16,010
there isn't just <i>a</i> gene.

53
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,430
For every gene, 
there are multiple versions, okay,

54
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:24,140
and these versions are called <i>alleles</i>.

55
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:27,860
So, as a simple example, 
we could simply assume that,

56
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,140
here's a particular gene,
somewhere along this stretch of DNA,

57
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,640
and it comes in three versions.

58
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,430
And so, we're just gonna 
call these now, here:

59
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:39,840
Allele 1, Allele 2, and Allele 3.

60
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,170
And you may have a particular
version of that allele.

61
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:49,160
Your friends may have 
other versions of those alleles.

62
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:55,400
The key takeaway message here 
is that genes come in different versions

63
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,960
and these versions are called alleles.

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:02,360
Now, I want to give you a concrete example
of what this looks like.

65
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:07,990
So, this is a map of the frequency, 
here, in color code,

66
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:09,890
of Lactase Persistence.

67
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:15,850
<i>Lactase Persistence</i> is a feature
by which adult individuals

68
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:19,010
continue to produce lactase,

69
00:04:19,010 --> 00:04:23,370
and <i>lactase</i> being the enzyme 
that can digest lactose,

70
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:25,850
the sugar that is in milk.

71
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:29,750
So, when humans are born,

72
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,900
they all have the ability to digest milk.

73
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:36,680
But normally, over time, 
humans actually lose this ability,

74
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:39,430
and as adults, are <i>lactose intolerant</i>--

75
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:43,420
they cannot digest lactose anymore.

76
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:46,460
But, a few individuals, 
or actually, quite many,

77
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:49,410
depending on which region 
of the world we're looking at,

78
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:56,740
have the ability to continue
to digest milk as adults

79
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,890
and those are called 
<i>lactase persistent individuals</i>.

80
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:04,210
And if you, now, look at this,
a part of the map of the world,

81
00:05:04,210 --> 00:05:07,920
you can see quite a striking diversity

82
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,410
of the frequency of alleles

83
00:05:11,410 --> 00:05:16,280
that actually generate this phenotype.

84
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:22,290
So, this is typically called <i>LCT</i>P*,

85
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:26,970
this allele that causes 
lactase persistence.

86
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:31,190
And you can see here, for example, 
in this part of the world,

87
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:34,650
Southeast Asia, China, and so on,

88
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,910
a huge amount of the human population,

89
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,990
a huge fraction of the human population

90
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:44,830
actually lives in this circle.

91
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:47,250
It's densely populated.

92
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:51,140
But you can see, 
there's almost no, or very little,

93
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,210
lactase persistence 
in this area of the world.

94
00:05:56,210 --> 00:06:00,430
On the other hand, we have parts here, 
in the Middle East,

95
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:03,980
in western Africa, and in Europe--

96
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:06,560
I'm gonna zoom in here--

97
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:11,160
that actually have a very high frequency 
of lactase persistence.

98
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:15,860
So, these alleles are quite frequent 
in these parts of the world.

99
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:18,200
We know relatively little,

100
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:22,150
there are multiple versions 
of these alleles

101
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:25,660
that cause lactase persistence.

102
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:29,890
In the European case, 
it is thought to have emerged

103
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:32,970
somewhere here in the Balkans

104
00:06:32,970 --> 00:06:36,380
probably around 7,000 years ago

105
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:39,420
and has then spread throughout Europe,

106
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:41,710
along with dairy farming,

107
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:45,280
because if you have dairy farming 
and animals that produce a lot of milk

108
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,170
that you use as a primary 
nutritional resource,

109
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,230
it would be beneficial to be lactase 
persistent, even as an adult.

110
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:58,160
And so, it's thought that these 
two things spread in parallel,

111
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,690
but this is still very active research 
that's going on.

112
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,860
But in any case,

113
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:07,690
this would completely agree 
with our definition of evolution,

114
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:10,990
namely, that this particular allele

115
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:13,910
changed in frequency over time.

116
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,790
And, in this case, 
over, roughly, 7,000 years.

117
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,670
Now, what are the forces
that can actually

118
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:26,140
lead to this allele frequency change?

119
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:28,660
And, we now understand 
that there are four forces,

120
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:33,650
four major forces, 
that effect allele frequencies.

121
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:38,260
The first one is probably 
the most famous one

122
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,100
and it's called <i>natural selection</i>,

123
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,060
famously discovered/described 
by Charles Darwin.

124
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,410
Now, I should note here

125
00:07:50,410 --> 00:07:54,730
that natural selection is by no means 
the only type of selection,

126
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:59,340
but it is probably the most potent one,
certainly the most widespread one,

127
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:05,580
and certainly, also, the most 
well-known form of selection.

128
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,420
But I put natural here, in parentheses, 
just to make clear.

129
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:14,480
Another very important force 
is called genetic drift.

130
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,750
<i>Genetic drift</i> actually describes

131
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:25,470
the change of allele frequencies
due to random chance,

132
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:28,420
and we learn a lot 
about that in Chapter 3.

133
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,350
It's a very fascinating process.

134
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:34,960
The third is migration,

135
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,920
or anything to do with populations 
or individuals moving between populations,

136
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:42,260
bringing in new genes, newly alleles.

137
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:47,110
And then, finally, last, 
but certainly not least, is mutation,

138
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,640
which is the ultimate engine

139
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:57,920
of creation of diversity, 
genetic diversity, allelic diversity.

140
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,180
So, what we'll do 
throughout this course is,

141
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,170
we'll talk about these four forces 
in great detail.

142
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:06,220
And, of course, 
the key point about this course

143
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:08,750
is that we won't just talk about it,

144
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:13,280
but we will actually implement 
all of these four forces.

145
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,690
And, we'll actually have 
a slightly different ordering.

146
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:21,640
We'll start in the next chapter 
with genetic drift,

147
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:26,880
and then we'll talk about mutation,
then about migration,

148
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,850
and at the end, about natural selection,

149
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,560
so the queen of the four forces.

150
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,510
What we'll do in this chapter here, 
Chapter 2, is,

151
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:40,330
we'll develop a model 
and implement that modeling code

152
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,480
that assumes that none of these 
four forces is acting.

153
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,660
And that's a very important thing for us to do

154
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,920
because we need a baseline 
to understand what actually happens

155
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,150
in a world where none 
of these forces are in effect,

156
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:57,920
so then, we when we later 
add these forces to the models,

157
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,860
we know exactly what is, 
in fact, changing.

158
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,620
So this concludes Chapter 2, Lecture 1.

159
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,860
I'll see you in the next video, Lecture 2.
