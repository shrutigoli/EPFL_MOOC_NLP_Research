00:00:03,230 --> 00:00:06,610
Welcome back: Nature, In Code.
We're in Chapter 2 lecture 3.

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:07,820
In this video,

3
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:11,350
we'll finish our investigation
of the Hardy Weinberg model.

4
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:13,690
After that we'll get coding.

5
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,990
So here's where we left off.

6
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:21,150
We started with this population 
of three different genotypes,

7
00:00:21,970 --> 00:00:26,530
A1A1, A1A2, and A2A2,
and we observed those

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:32,840
at 15% frequency,
50% frequency, and 35% frequency,

9
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,740
and from that we deduced 
the A1 and A2 allele frequency

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:40,309
is at 40% and at 60%.

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,584
So these are the genotype frequencies,

12
00:00:46,135 --> 00:00:48,982
and these are allele frequencies.

13
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,260
So what I'm now going to do is,

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:54,689
I'm actually going to stick
with these percentage points.

15
00:00:55,621 --> 00:01:00,740
We started discussing
a small population of 100 individuals,

16
00:01:00,740 --> 00:01:04,180
but actually I want to really just 
stick with these percentage points now,

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,990
rather than absolute numbers
for a very important reason,

18
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:10,638
because the Hardy Weinberg 
model actually makes

19
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:13,630
a number of assumptions
that are important,

20
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:16,570
and that are simplifying,
and one of the key assumptions

21
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,440
is that of an infinite population size.

22
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:29,400
Now what that means is
that it doesn't make sense

23
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:30,940
to talk about absolute numbers,

24
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,200
because if the population size
is infinite, then these numbers here

25
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,520
would also be infinite.

26
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,800
So we need, in fact,
to talk about percentages.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,140
Now, why do we do this?

28
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:45,200
Why do we make the assumption
about an infinite population size?

29
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,820
Well, it's quite simple.

30
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:50,590
if we were to make an assumption 
of a finite population size

31
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:54,050
and potentially, in fact,
a small population size,

32
00:01:54,050 --> 00:01:57,010
then we would get effects of random chance

33
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,170
and this would be genetic drift.

34
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:01,930
But remember,
we want to develop a null model

35
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:05,080
that doesn't have any of the four forces

36
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:08,740
that we described in the first video.

37
00:02:08,740 --> 00:02:12,040
So we need to assume
an infinite population size,

38
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:15,097
not to get any of those effects
of genetic drift.

39
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:21,820
Another simplifying assumption 
is that of non-overlapping generations.

40
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,470
Non-overlapping generations.

41
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:28,840
So, when a new generation is born,

42
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:31,020
the old generation dies immediately.

43
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,860
There's no overlap and that 
makes things very simple

44
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,470
with the bookkeeping.

45
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:38,978
Also, we have sexual reproduction,

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:43,472
and it is in fact completely random.

47
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:49,380
We don't really have now any sort 
of gender, any sort of sex, male-female.

48
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,230
It's just basically like molecules
bumping into each other in a gas,

49
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:57,747
or in our case, alleles bumping
into each other at random,

50
00:02:57,747 --> 00:03:00,380
generating new genotypes,

51
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:03,770
or new frequencies of these genotypes.

52
00:03:03,770 --> 00:03:05,390
And finally, I just want to repeat,

53
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:10,180
that we have not none, 
okay, of those four forces.

54
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,480
So we have no genetic drift,
no selection whatsoever,

55
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,390
no mutation, and no migration.

56
00:03:16,390 --> 00:03:20,318
And again, I'd like
to just mention briefly,

57
00:03:20,318 --> 00:03:23,720
why are we using
such a simplified model?

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,470
because we clearly understand

59
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:30,310
that some of these assumptions 
are violated in nature,

60
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,110
so they're not completely
accurately describing nature.

61
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:39,450
Well, the best analogy I can
maybe offer is that of a map.

62
00:03:40,144 --> 00:03:44,600
So assume you want to go
from point A to point B,

63
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:50,140
and those points are maybe something
like 100km apart from each other.

64
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:53,770
Now, you'd like to have a map
that tells you how you have to go

65
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,830
from A to B,
but of course this map will be

66
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:01,580
a very simplified representation
of the real world.

67
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:04,430
It will only have a few key components.

68
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:09,300
For example, you know roads,
how you get there from A to B,

69
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:15,240
maybe there's a town over here
and maybe there's a forest over here,

70
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,960
but you get the idea.

71
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:20,610
Almost everything is missing
from this map,

72
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:26,240
this map is a very simplified,
artificial version of the world,

73
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,520
but it helps you navigate from A to B.

74
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:34,830
In fact, if you were to build an 
increasingly realistic map.

75
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:38,150
First of all, you wouldn't see
the details on this scale,

76
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,470
and if you would like
to see the details on this scale

77
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:43,390
you would eventually
get to a one-to-one map,

78
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,960
a map that describes the world
in complete detail.

79
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,720
But this would be a terrible map,

80
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,460
I mean it would be 100km in diameter,

81
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:53,540
and so it would be completely useless.

82
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:57,840
So think about models like this 
like you think about a map,

83
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:01,538
you simplify down
to the essential components.

84
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,240
So now that we have these 
numbers in place,

85
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:08,081
let's calculate what the next 
generation would look like.

86
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:12,450
So what would the next generation
of genotype frequencies look like?

87
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:16,100
So we have three different types
of genotypes.

88
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:21,530
So how do I actually create
these genotypes?

89
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,567
Well, the way to think
about this, visually,

90
00:05:24,567 --> 00:05:28,019
is now that you have
this infinitely-sized gamete pool,

91
00:05:28,019 --> 00:05:30,924
and in this gamete pool
we have two types of alleles,

92
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,490
and 40% of those alleles,
40% of the gamete pool,

93
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:40,148
is of type A1 allele, 60% is of A2.

94
00:05:41,661 --> 00:05:45,310
So when you want to generate
an A1A1 genotype,

95
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:48,200
you first have to pick an A1 allele,

96
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,810
and that happens
with a probability of 0.4,

97
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:53,702
because that is
the frequency of this allele.

98
00:05:54,179 --> 00:05:55,850
But to generate an A1A1,

99
00:05:55,850 --> 00:06:00,990
you have to not only pick one
but a second A1 allele as well,

100
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,390
and so the probability
of that is also 0.4.

101
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:08,498
So the total probability is 0.16.

102
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:13,340
Now this next simple case is A2A2.

103
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:16,580
Same logic: you have to pick
any two alleles,

104
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,320
and then you have to pick
another A2 allele,

105
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,110
and this happens
with the frequency of this allele,

106
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:25,590
and so the combined probability
here is 0.36.

107
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,290
Now you know these two
have to add up to one,

108
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:32,596
and so you could already calculate
what the probability of the A1A2 is.

109
00:06:32,596 --> 00:06:35,720
But just to be explicit,
an A1A2 can be generated

110
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:41,810
either by picking an A1 allele,
and then an A2,

111
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:48,449
or it can be generated
by first picking an A2 and then an A1.

112
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:55,040
And so if you add
these two together, you get 0.48.

113
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,094
Okay, so in other words,

114
00:06:58,094 --> 00:07:03,354
our new genotype frequencies 
are now 16%, for the A1A1,

115
00:07:04,356 --> 00:07:07,300
for the A1A2, we have 48%,

116
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:12,517
and for the A2A2, we have 36%.

117
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:17,053
And if we compare this
with the previous values that we had,

118
00:07:17,053 --> 00:07:19,593
previously we had here 15%,

119
00:07:19,593 --> 00:07:23,680
so the A1A1 genotype frequency
increased by one percent.

120
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:27,080
Same with the A2A2.
In fact, we started with 35%,

121
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,970
we're now at 36%.

122
00:07:28,970 --> 00:07:31,590
So again, an increase of 1%.

123
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,040
On the other hand, with the A1A2
we started with 50%,

124
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:38,542
but we lost 2% to the homozygotes,

125
00:07:38,542 --> 00:07:43,894
and so we're now at 48%,
so a loss of 2%.

126
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:48,290
Now, these are
very important frequencies,

127
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:50,570
and I'll tell you why in a second.

128
00:07:52,470 --> 00:07:56,302
But I want you to keep
those frequencies in mind.

129
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:58,123
Okay.

130
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:03,760
So what are the allele frequencies 
in this new generation?

131
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:07,681
Well, that we can easily deduce as well,
just like we did before.

132
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:12,134
So remember we have here
the A1A1 genotype at 16%.

133
00:08:12,134 --> 00:08:17,012
All of those, of course,
go to the A1 alleles.

134
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:22,770
Of the A1A2 we have 48%.

135
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:25,300
Half of those are A1 alleles,

136
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:28,512
so 24% goes to the A1 allele,

137
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:34,127
and 22... let me just do this
with an arrow,

138
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:38,070
24% go to the A2 alleles,

139
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:40,424
because half of them are A2 alleles.

140
00:08:40,424 --> 00:08:46,740
And here, of A2A2, all the 36% are,
of course, A2 alleles.

141
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,590
And so if you add these numbers
together, 16 plus 24 is 40,

142
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:57,410
so 40 for the A1, and 60 for the A2.

143
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,440
And now look at this--

144
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:05,690
same allele frequencies,
40% A1, 60% A2.

145
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:09,340
So the allele frequencies 
in fact did not change.

146
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:10,801
And why should they?

147
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,490
Remember in this model,

148
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:18,970
we got rid of all the forces that 
are known to affect the A1 and A2,

149
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,420
or just any type of allele frequency,

150
00:09:22,420 --> 00:09:24,710
so it's completely in line with our model

151
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:27,575
that the allele frequencies 
do in fact not change,

152
00:09:27,575 --> 00:09:31,101
they remain constant, or in other words,

153
00:09:31,842 --> 00:09:34,987
we have no evolution as we defined it.

154
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,677
For evolution, we need a change
in these numbers over time,

155
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:44,100
but this doesn't happen--
it stayed constant, 40% and 60%.

156
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:50,030
The genotype frequencies
change slightly: +1%, -2%, +1%,

157
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:53,228
but nevertheless they changed 
within one generation.

158
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,270
So we could now move on
and ask ourselves,

159
00:09:57,270 --> 00:10:01,605
okay, let's move on one generation,
what happens then?

160
00:10:01,605 --> 00:10:05,300
So we could now calculate
these genotype frequencies again

161
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,040
for the next generation,
and how would we do that?

162
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,340
Well, we would simply go through
this exact same calculation,

163
00:10:12,340 --> 00:10:14,190
but as you can see here,

164
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:16,530
it will actually be useless 
to do this calculation,

165
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:20,970
because we just did it,
and these calculations are based

166
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:24,480
on the allele frequencies here:
40% and 60%,

167
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,360
and we just said, well,
these values don't change,

168
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,940
so the results here are not 
going to change either.

169
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,700
We can keep calculating 
this again and again and again.

170
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,296
Of course it will always be
the same values.

171
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,160
And so these values in fact now,

172
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:42,750
these genotype frequencies 
will also remain constant,

173
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,850
and the reason why I highlighted these

174
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,030
is because these are
very important frequencies,

175
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,750
because those are now
the Hardy Weinberg frequencies.

176
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,120
And these are incredibly 
important frequencies,

177
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:59,970
because what the Hardy Weinberg, 
what the model essentially says

178
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,400
is that whatever frequencies
we start with,

179
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:08,670
within one generation will go
into these Hardy Weinberg frequencies.

180
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,773
The allele frequencies don't change,

181
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:16,300
but the genotype frequencies,
they may change, within one generation,

182
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:20,460
and then they'll stay there at these
Hardy Weinberg frequencies forever.

183
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,506
I want to finish this by explaining,

184
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:29,220
in a graphic,
what this looks like in a plot,

185
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,460
because we could essentially
plot these values over time.

186
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:37,040
So here we would have
time in generations.

187
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:43,330
And so we would have
generation 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on,

188
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:46,874
and if we would now plot here
the allele frequencies,

189
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,610
okay, allele frequencies,

190
00:11:49,610 --> 00:11:52,140
we would start with any two values,

191
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:54,339
and in fact we would...

192
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:57,940
we would have
constant values here over time,

193
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:59,868
so two straight lines.

194
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:04,320
Now the plot for the genotype frequencies,

195
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,584
so again, time in generations,

196
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:11,020
would look similar,
but slightly different.

197
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:15,350
So here we would have
the genotype frequencies,

198
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,844
what we would have here
are three values, in our current model,

199
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:23,480
and we could perhaps now assume
that one of them goes down,

200
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,940
and the other two go slightly up.

201
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:27,974
Okay.

202
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:32,060
So they change within one generation,
but then from there,

203
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:35,424
they will in fact remain constant.

204
00:12:36,486 --> 00:12:39,017
And these values here now,

205
00:12:40,013 --> 00:12:44,698
these are the Hardy Weinberg 
genotype frequencies.

206
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:49,410
And this sums up the Hardy Weinberg model.

207
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:53,680
So in the Hardy Weinberg world 
the allele frequencies don't change,

208
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,670
number one.

209
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:59,890
Number 2, the genotype frequencies,
If they're not at Hardy Weinberg,

210
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:03,130
then they will get there
within one generation,

211
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:06,100
and then they will remain there forever.

212
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:10,210
So we've now learned about this 
null model of evolutionary biology,

213
00:13:10,210 --> 00:13:12,730
which is the Hardy Weinberg model.

214
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,050
It has a number of consequences 
that we just discussed.

215
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,530
Now, what we'll need to do
is we'll finally need to get coding,

216
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:22,200
and implement this model in JavaScript,

217
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,544
and we'll start doing that
in the next video. I'll see you there.
