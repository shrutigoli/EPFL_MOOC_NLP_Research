1
00:00:03,039 --> 00:00:04,590
Welcome back to Nature, In Code.

2
00:00:04,685 --> 00:00:06,248
We're in chapter 6, Lecture 3.

3
00:00:06,349 --> 00:00:08,137
We just finished a previous lecture 

4
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:10,485
with a bit of a quantatative 
framework

5
00:00:10,809 --> 00:00:13,809
for understanding how genotypes 
change over time

6
00:00:14,027 --> 00:00:18,527
given natural selection 
due to the differences in fitness.

7
00:00:18,657 --> 00:00:20,794
Now we're going to take this 
one step further

8
00:00:20,946 --> 00:00:24,584
and we're going to take a look at 
this affects the allele frequencies

9
00:00:24,686 --> 00:00:26,911
which is ultimately what 
we're interested in.

10
00:00:27,015 --> 00:00:28,803
So again we're going to 
do things here

11
00:00:28,944 --> 00:00:31,131
in very simple mathematical terms.

12
00:00:31,245 --> 00:00:37,620
So we started with this A1A1,A1A2, 
and A2A2 framework

13
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:41,692
and we said alright after 1 natural 
step of natural selection

14
00:00:41,884 --> 00:00:47,972
the fitnesses here would be P^2 W11
divided by this normalizing factor

15
00:00:48,595 --> 00:00:54,032
and here would be 2pq times W12
divided by this normalizing factor

16
00:00:54,212 --> 00:00:59,687
and here would be q^2 W22 
divided by this normalizing factor.

17
00:01:00,015 --> 00:01:03,015
And so we can now very 
easily ask ourselves

18
00:01:03,144 --> 00:01:05,031
okay what is the
 allele frequency now?

19
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:08,091
so the allele frequency in 
the next generation.

20
00:01:08,218 --> 00:01:10,918
Well it's simply 
this entire frequency here,

21
00:01:11,053 --> 00:01:15,691
because all of these genotypes will 
fully contribute to the A1 allele

22
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:21,066
So it's p^2 W11 over W bar

23
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:24,301
and half of this term because

24
00:01:24,452 --> 00:01:29,777
half of the alleles in A1A2 
genotypes are obviously of type  A1.

25
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:38,432
So it's this term 2pq W12 
divided by W bar

26
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,877
but then we have to divide 
this again by a factor of 2.

27
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:45,059
And now of course we can simplify 
this a little bit and say okay

28
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,433
2 divided by 2, 
we can get rid of that.

29
00:01:47,556 --> 00:01:51,819
Now we have the same denominator
so this can be simplified as

30
00:01:52,303 --> 00:02:04,228
p^2 W11 plus pq times W12 
divided by W bar.

31
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:10,533
And now if we ask ourselves, what 
is the change in allele frequencies?

32
00:02:10,982 --> 00:02:15,907
Then it would simply be 
what we have in the next generation

33
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:18,003
minus what we have before. Alright?

34
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,255
So this is very easy, 
so it's this term minus p.

35
00:02:24,573 --> 00:02:29,685
Now if we try to simplify this,
we can simplify it a little bit but

36
00:02:29,899 --> 00:02:32,761
we end up with an equation 
that's not a very simple equation.

37
00:02:32,962 --> 00:02:35,349
But I'm going to show it 
to you nonetheless

38
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,863
because it is a central equation.

39
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:39,057
So what it is is, 

40
00:02:39,324 --> 00:02:53,687
it is pq times p times W11 
minus W12 plus q times W11 minus W22

41
00:02:54,611 --> 00:02:58,261
So this whole term here 
I multiply it by pq,

42
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:13,073
and then divide it W bar which is 
p^2 W11 plus 2pq W12 plus q^2 W22,

43
00:03:13,289 --> 00:03:17,651
and again I'm really putting 
it here simplified in quotes

44
00:03:17,767 --> 00:03:20,605
because this is obviously anything 
but a simple equation

45
00:03:20,696 --> 00:03:25,271
but nevertheless it's a central 
equation in evolutionary biology.

46
00:03:25,404 --> 00:03:25,917
Why?

47
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:29,222
Well, first of all it calculates 
the change in allele frequencies

48
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:32,723
which is our 
working definition of evolution.

49
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:37,359
And it does so in response 
to natural selection

50
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:38,839
using these fitness terms

51
00:03:38,992 --> 00:03:41,342
and we know that natural
selection's  the queen of

52
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:44,199
the forces acting on this delta p.

53
00:03:44,377 --> 00:03:48,415
And so this is really a central 
to evolutionary biology

54
00:03:48,551 --> 00:03:50,213
as one can imagine.

55
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:53,329
But so now we look at this 
bit of a beast of an equation

56
00:03:53,485 --> 00:03:57,210
and we ask ourselves okay 
so what's the point here?

57
00:03:58,103 --> 00:04:02,528
We want to understand whether 
Wp goes up or down and by how much

58
00:04:02,705 --> 00:04:08,030
but is it very surprising, we have 
an allele that has a higher fitness

59
00:04:08,133 --> 00:04:12,808
Okay if it's A1 
we expect Wp to be positive

60
00:04:12,945 --> 00:04:16,058
because we expect 
the A1 frequency to go up.

61
00:04:16,645 --> 00:04:19,645
Conversely, if A1 has a lower 
fitness than A2 

62
00:04:19,972 --> 00:04:24,197
we expect p to go down.
I mean is it really that simple

63
00:04:24,491 --> 00:04:28,666
Is that all there is? And this 
question kind of has two answers

64
00:04:28,795 --> 00:04:31,795
depending on how you look at it.
And the answers are yes and no.

65
00:04:31,998 --> 00:04:34,998
So, if you look at this 
from a purely

66
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:40,276
allele perspective alone 
then yes it is that simple.

67
00:04:40,552 --> 00:04:43,927
Allele has higher fitness, 
fine it's probably going to increase

68
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:46,107
the lower fitness is going 
to decrease

69
00:04:46,267 --> 00:04:48,979
But if you look at it 
from the perspective of genotypes

70
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:51,192
it's actually not that simple

71
00:04:51,368 --> 00:04:53,955
and we need to in fact 
to look at this problem

72
00:04:54,041 --> 00:04:55,916
from the perspective of the genotype

73
00:04:56,074 --> 00:04:59,074
because ultimatly 
it's genotypes that have a fitness

74
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,205
it's genotypes that 
can build individuals if you will

75
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:06,924
that then survive and reproduce.

76
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:11,104
It's the genotypes that make it 
from generation to generation

77
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,520
packaged of course 
likely differently.

78
00:05:15,386 --> 00:05:18,386
And so it is ultimatley the alleles
that have a fitness

79
00:05:18,531 --> 00:05:21,894
but we can't think of the alleles 
alone as having a fitness

80
00:05:22,177 --> 00:05:26,327
because they usually 
come packaged as genotypes.

81
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:29,473
And if we do this 
we get really interesting dynamics

82
00:05:29,951 --> 00:05:33,926
and I want to show you now how 
we can develop this framework.

83
00:05:34,108 --> 00:05:35,508
It's really fascinating. 

84
00:05:35,654 --> 00:05:42,641
We can simplify this whole framework
we have A1A1,A1A2, and A2A2.

85
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:47,978
And our idea is that we're going to 
assign fitnesses to these genotypes.

86
00:05:48,308 --> 00:05:52,308
So before when we did this 
fitness we simply called this

87
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:55,885
W11, W12, and W22.

88
00:05:56,274 --> 00:05:58,874
Now we're going to make
 two simplifying assumptions

89
00:05:59,168 --> 00:06:01,243
We're going to say, 
first of all you know what?

90
00:06:01,374 --> 00:06:03,287
We're going to set this to 1.

91
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,639
Why, well because we can 
and it makes things simpler.

92
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:11,350
As I said many times the 
absolute values here don't matter,

93
00:06:11,507 --> 00:06:13,369
what matters are 
the relative values.

94
00:06:13,774 --> 00:06:16,774
So it's completly fine 
if you set one of them to 1.

95
00:06:17,454 --> 00:06:20,054
And then the other assumption 
that I'm going to make is,

96
00:06:20,426 --> 00:06:25,576
I'm going to say the other 
homozygote has a lower value

97
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:29,184
a lower fitness value. Namely 1-s.

98
00:06:30,684 --> 00:06:32,884
So why this genotype 
and not this genotype?

99
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:36,192
Well it really doesn't matter, you 
can swap the 1's and the 2's here

100
00:06:36,316 --> 00:06:38,279
and you'll have the 
exact same situation.

101
00:06:38,353 --> 00:06:41,353
You just have one of 
the homozygotes as a fitness

102
00:06:41,543 --> 00:06:44,543
1 and the other as 1-s.

103
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:46,894
Okay a lower fitness.

104
00:06:47,466 --> 00:06:53,078
By the way this s now we call 
this the selection coefficient.

105
00:06:53,507 --> 00:06:56,019
Okay the selection coefficient.

106
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:01,888
Good, so now what 
about the heterozygote?

107
00:07:02,219 --> 00:07:06,781
Well here we're going to say 
that this one has a fitness of 1-s

108
00:07:06,952 --> 00:07:08,802
but I'm going to 
modify this term here

109
00:07:09,367 --> 00:07:13,617
by multiplying it with age first. 
So 1-age s.

110
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:18,483
And we call this h 
the heterozygous effect.

111
00:07:18,686 --> 00:07:23,124
So hetorozygous effect.

112
00:07:23,312 --> 00:07:29,562
Why? Well because it only 
affects the heterozygotes, A1A2.

113
00:07:29,993 --> 00:07:31,530
Okay now  if we would do the math

114
00:07:31,717 --> 00:07:34,504
we would simplfy this 
equation a little bit of delta p

115
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:44,782
and we would get 
pqs times ph plus q times 1 minus h.

116
00:07:45,379 --> 00:07:45,891
Okay

117
00:07:46,254 --> 00:07:55,104
Divided by 1 minus 2pqhs minus 2qs.

118
00:07:55,302 --> 00:07:59,852
Now again I'm not pretending 
that this is a much simpler formula

119
00:07:59,969 --> 00:08:02,969
but it's certainly simpler 
than the one before.

120
00:08:03,686 --> 00:08:06,336
And this is as simple as we can get

121
00:08:06,459 --> 00:08:10,497
because before we had these 
three values in the equation

122
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:16,920
W11,W12, and W22 and now we're only 
working with only two values

123
00:08:17,019 --> 00:08:20,019
namely s and h 
so it's simplified a bit.

124
00:08:20,606 --> 00:08:24,168
But still this is sort of now
the queen  of equations

125
00:08:24,537 --> 00:08:27,512
in evolutionary biology.

126
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:31,060
And I know it's not 
the most beautiful equation

127
00:08:31,154 --> 00:08:34,354
but it's a very powerful equation.

128
00:08:34,428 --> 00:08:36,916
And I want you to take 
note of this equation because

129
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:41,617
we are now going to implement 
this equation in Javascript

130
00:08:41,705 --> 00:08:43,655
in a few minutes.

131
00:08:43,785 --> 00:08:46,785
Before we do that 
there's one more thing.

132
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:51,386
If you look at this framework 
that we're going to use

133
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:56,171
there are actually a number of 
different cases that we can look at

134
00:08:56,298 --> 00:09:00,073
depending on this value of age. 
If you have a given s

135
00:09:00,515 --> 00:09:02,928
you can now, 
depending on the value of age

136
00:09:03,216 --> 00:09:06,616
get very different what I 
would call fitness landscapes.

137
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:09,865
What do I mean by this? 
Well let's take a look.

138
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:14,055
So we have here the fitness, the W

139
00:09:15,187 --> 00:09:19,387
and here we have the 
three different genotypes

140
00:09:19,492 --> 00:09:25,317
A1A1, A1A2, and A2A2.

141
00:09:25,986 --> 00:09:28,298
Okay, and we said 
lets say this is 1 here.

142
00:09:28,485 --> 00:09:32,585
We said A1A1 has a fitness of  1.

143
00:09:33,114 --> 00:09:36,839
And we also said A2A2 
has a lower fitness.

144
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:39,851
Okay so lower by how much? Well.

145
00:09:40,004 --> 00:09:43,254
If we would draw the 
imaginary line here this is 1.

146
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:45,002
So it's this difference here.

147
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:52,274
This is s selection coefficient so 
the value here would be 1-s.

148
00:09:52,489 --> 00:09:56,889
So now how are we going 
to choose the value of age?

149
00:09:57,094 --> 00:09:59,306
So we can do this in 
three different ways.

150
00:10:00,043 --> 00:10:06,705
The first way we can do this is we 
can assume that h is larger than 1.

151
00:10:07,272 --> 00:10:08,822
So what does that mean exactly?

152
00:10:08,977 --> 00:10:11,302
Well, remember that A1A2

153
00:10:12,161 --> 00:10:15,811
so that the fitness right, 
just as a reminder

154
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:21,262
the fitness of A1A2 is 1-hs.

155
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,763
Okay so where is 
that point going to lie?

156
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:30,172
Well we have 1-s here 
but if age is larger than 1

157
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:31,343
then this term here

158
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:36,092
is actually going to be 
even larger than s alone right?

159
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:38,833
Because it's multiplied 
with a value that's larger than 1.

160
00:10:39,145 --> 00:10:45,170
So 1 minus this term 
is down here somewhere.

161
00:10:46,167 --> 00:10:48,904
Yeah it's lower than this 
value

162
00:10:49,443 --> 00:10:53,630
because we multiply s by age 
which is larger than 1.

163
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,958
And so if you now look at this 
this is kind of a value right?

164
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:01,822
So it turns out now 
in this scenario

165
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:03,661
when his is larger than 1

166
00:11:03,819 --> 00:11:07,207
that the heterozygote is actually 
the genotype

167
00:11:07,311 --> 00:11:10,048
withe the lowest frequency 
of all three.

168
00:11:10,448 --> 00:11:12,973
The other alternative 
that we can think  of  is

169
00:11:13,088 --> 00:11:18,563
that h is smaller than zero. 
It is in fact negative.

170
00:11:19,105 --> 00:11:20,279
Well what does that mean?

171
00:11:20,419 --> 00:11:22,481
Well let's take a look again
at this formula 

172
00:11:22,619 --> 00:11:26,857
if h is a negative term then this 
term her is going to be negative.

173
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:30,935
1 minus something negative is 
going to be 1 plus something.

174
00:11:31,554 --> 00:11:35,429
So in fact the value here 
will be larger than 1.

175
00:11:35,558 --> 00:11:37,646
Okay, so it's going to be 
here somewhere.

176
00:11:37,734 --> 00:11:40,722
And this is also interesting 
because it's the exact opposite.

177
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:44,265
So this now is kind of a peak, 
again if you will.

178
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:51,017
And now, the heterozygote fitness 
is in fact, the highest of all 3.

179
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:55,891
And then we can have 
the cases in between

180
00:11:56,723 --> 00:12:03,911
where we can say okay 
h is certainly larger than zero.

181
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:08,808
Okay it is a positive value 
but it is smaller than 1.

182
00:12:09,677 --> 00:12:12,964
So it is neither of these extremes 
but is somewhere in between.

183
00:12:13,672 --> 00:12:20,597
And what that means is that at 
the maximum d values would be here

184
00:12:20,721 --> 00:12:23,021
if h were exactly zero.

185
00:12:23,221 --> 00:12:28,984
And the minimum would be here 
if age were exactly 1.

186
00:12:29,771 --> 00:12:32,246
Right, because this would 
correspond to this value.

187
00:12:32,378 --> 00:12:35,953
But it could be really
any value here in between.

188
00:12:36,747 --> 00:12:38,834
But no matter which value 
you would pick

189
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:44,716
this would be neither a valley 
nor a peak. It would be a slope.

190
00:12:45,237 --> 00:12:49,049
And so that's why I use 
the term fitness landscape.

191
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:52,830
Because it has these elements
of landscapes, slopes

192
00:12:52,988 --> 00:12:55,163
of valleys and of  peaks.

193
00:12:55,303 --> 00:12:58,440
And it turns out 
that these three situations

194
00:12:58,605 --> 00:13:02,918
describe three very different types 
of natural selection

195
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:04,661
with very different outcomes.

196
00:13:04,844 --> 00:13:09,632
So the green one in fact where 
age is in this intermediary value

197
00:13:09,758 --> 00:13:14,295
where you have the slope. This 
is called Directional Selection.

198
00:13:14,992 --> 00:13:18,629
Directional Selection.

199
00:13:20,116 --> 00:13:24,978
The case where you have the peak, 
so where age is in fact negative,

200
00:13:25,055 --> 00:13:27,555
and your heterozygote 
has the highest fitness

201
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:31,132
this is called Balancing Selection.

202
00:13:31,509 --> 00:13:33,646
Balancing Selection.

203
00:13:34,805 --> 00:13:36,580
And last but certainly not least

204
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:40,495
In the case where age is 
not only positive but larger than 1

205
00:13:40,598 --> 00:13:42,385
and you get these fitness valleys

206
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:47,852
this is a situation 
that is called Disruptive Selection.

207
00:13:48,904 --> 00:13:52,004
So at the moment you kind of have 
to take this at face value

208
00:13:52,216 --> 00:13:55,454
I'm telling you that these are 
three different types of selections.

209
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:58,880
You can certainly see that here 
but I'm also suggesting

210
00:13:59,061 --> 00:14:03,073
that these have very different 
outcomes in terms of evolution.

211
00:14:03,244 --> 00:14:09,156
Okay, now enough claims let's 
put these ideas into JavaScript.

212
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:12,277
And let's see what happens,
I'll see you in the next lecture.
