00:00:03,089 --> 00:00:06,077
Welcome back. Nature, In Code. 
We're in Chapter six, lecture 10. 

2
00:00:06,232 --> 00:00:09,232
This is the last lecture 
of this chapter and in it

3
00:00:09,412 --> 00:00:12,712
I'd like to show you how tiny 
modification to our code

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,380
can have quite dramatic 
consequences on our host parasite

5
00:00:16,563 --> 00:00:17,875
dynamics.

6
00:00:18,272 --> 00:00:21,459
So here we have our dynamics 
as we've observed them before.

7
00:00:21,615 --> 00:00:24,527
And by the way these are called 
Red Queen dynamics 

8
00:00:24,707 --> 00:00:28,444
from the book or adapted. 

9
00:00:28,623 --> 00:00:32,710
The term was taken from the book 
"Through the Looking Glass"

10
00:00:32,874 --> 00:00:36,336
where the protagonist, Alice, 
finds herself in a strange place

11
00:00:36,516 --> 00:00:40,753
where the environment moves. 
And the Red queen who lives there 

12
00:00:40,937 --> 00:00:44,687
explains to Alice that 
because the environment moves,

13
00:00:44,859 --> 00:00:47,859
one needs to do 
all the running one can do

14
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:51,144
do to stay in the same place. And
this is exactly what's happening

15
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:54,810
here as well. In the long term 
nothing changes. Everything remains

16
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:58,097
in the same place, so to speak, 
but one has to keep

17
00:00:58,284 --> 00:01:00,572
adapting all the time
just to keep up.

18
00:01:00,701 --> 00:01:03,701
So this is called 
Red Queen Dynamics.

19
00:01:03,871 --> 00:01:06,821
So, by the way, let's go 
back to our real quick 

20
00:01:07,169 --> 00:01:10,232
and go to our global variable 
definitions and just change 

21
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:13,428
these values here a little bit.
As I said, these are fairly high

22
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:17,448
selection coefficients, so let's 
reduce them maybe by factor 10, 

23
00:01:17,599 --> 00:01:20,599
so that we have a selection 
coefficient here of 2% and here,

24
00:01:20,784 --> 00:01:25,559
5% and then save this, 
go back and reload this.

25
00:01:25,723 --> 00:01:28,873
And as you can see here, we still
observed the same dynamics, 

26
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:31,745
but they are actually much, 
much, much slower.

27
00:01:31,969 --> 00:01:34,582
So you can reload this 
a couple of times and you can see

28
00:01:34,754 --> 00:01:37,067
these dynamics are much lower now.

29
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:41,633
Correspondingly, if we go back 
to the code and change these values 

30
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,758
to very large values. So 
for example, SH.5 and SP.9.

31
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,987
So huge selection coefficients and 
we save this and go back to the

32
00:01:52,173 --> 00:01:56,985
browser. We can see that these 
cycles are even faster.

33
00:01:57,165 --> 00:02:00,215
So the selection coefficients 
here have only one 

34
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:05,465
effect and that's to essentially 
make these dynamics much, much 

35
00:02:05,632 --> 00:02:09,844
faster or slower depending 
of course, on the magnitude of these

36
00:02:10,012 --> 00:02:11,937
selection coefficients.

37
00:02:12,397 --> 00:02:15,847
Now, let's go back to the code 
and put those back to point two

38
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:18,573
and point five as we had before. 

39
00:02:18,749 --> 00:02:23,499
Okay, save this, go back just to
see. Yeah, still looking good.

40
00:02:23,669 --> 00:02:28,719
So now, I want to show you 
an example of how a tiny change

41
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:34,433
here can have huge effects. We saw
that the dynamics are consistent 

42
00:02:34,604 --> 00:02:40,041
over time. They are always the same 
once you see one oscillation.

43
00:02:40,213 --> 00:02:43,388
You can easily predict that it's
going to be like this for the rest 

44
00:02:43,548 --> 00:02:48,110
of time. Now, let's change this. 
Let's take a look here.

45
00:02:48,286 --> 00:02:54,673
This is the host selection- 
the host selection line here

46
00:02:54,851 --> 00:02:57,851
the function and in this line here, 
we calculate the new

47
00:02:58,016 --> 00:03:01,229
frequencies by multiplying the 
old frequency with the fitness

48
00:03:01,394 --> 00:03:05,082
that we just calculated. And what 
we're going to do now is we're going to

49
00:03:05,251 --> 00:03:09,139
add a little bit of noise here, 
simple because you know, we may

50
00:03:09,335 --> 00:03:13,360
for example assume that our host 
population is not nearly infinite

51
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:18,333
in size, and there would be some 
effects that have to do with

52
00:03:18,563 --> 00:03:23,113
random noise. So we're simply 
going to say, we take whatever

53
00:03:23,294 --> 00:03:28,732
we calculated here and then to it 
we're going to add a little bit of

54
00:03:28,936 --> 00:03:31,873
noise. And how are we going 
to do this? Well, we saw it before

55
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:34,712
We're simply going to add 
a little bit of math at random

56
00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:40,684
but weigh by some factor because 
otherwise this would be way too

57
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:44,619
large, so for example, here we can
weigh it by .01, so this will now be

58
00:03:44,733 --> 00:03:48,208
a random number between 0 and .01.

59
00:03:48,387 --> 00:03:51,461
And now we're simply going to 
add this to each frequency, and then

60
00:03:51,607 --> 00:03:55,958
of course, at the end we will still 
properly do the normalization.

61
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:59,130
So a little bit of noise here, 
let's save this, go back to

62
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:03,397
browser and reload this and you can
see something quite interesting here

63
00:04:03,598 --> 00:04:05,323
so these seem to dampen.

64
00:04:05,496 --> 00:04:09,459
Now, actually we don't see a whole 
lot here. Let's maybe increase

65
00:04:09,632 --> 00:04:12,632
the generations here by factor 10.

66
00:04:12,787 --> 00:04:15,787
So I'm going to say 
4,000 generations and then

67
00:04:15,961 --> 00:04:18,799
we can reload this and now 
this looks quite interesting,

68
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:22,823
so we can reload this a couple of 
times. And two things can be

69
00:04:22,997 --> 00:04:27,259
observed. First of all, however
large the original oscillations are,

70
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,777
they're quickly are being reduced. 
There are still oscillations

71
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,050
maybe that's actually a little bit
 too large. Let's -- No, actually 

72
00:04:34,213 --> 00:04:37,988
4,000 seems fine. So these would 
still reduce,

73
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,885
but then it's not deterministic in 
any meaningful way.

74
00:04:43,063 --> 00:04:46,163
Some of these have these large 
oscillations here and then they

75
00:04:46,337 --> 00:04:49,862
almost disappear, and then 
they become much larger.

76
00:04:50,031 --> 00:04:53,231
And that's a really interesting 
phenomenon. You can see here all 

77
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:57,774
kinds of interesting patterns that 
occur simply due to this

78
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:00,825
tiny little change of adding 
starcastic noise and

79
00:05:01,005 --> 00:05:04,518
that's something really important 
I would say. If the system behaves

80
00:05:04,687 --> 00:05:08,337
 in a certain way, and you add 
a little bit of noise to it,

81
00:05:08,769 --> 00:05:12,357
and it doesn't behave in the exact 
same way anymore, then you can

82
00:05:12,533 --> 00:05:15,808
probably assume certainly when
it's a biological system that

83
00:05:15,977 --> 00:05:20,714
this is the more realistic where,
because we always have

84
00:05:20,877 --> 00:05:23,440
random effects in the real world.

85
00:05:23,605 --> 00:05:28,192
But in any case, this now concludes
this lecture and this chapter

86
00:05:28,367 --> 00:05:33,804
so you implemented the last 
and final, and major force

87
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,970
I would say of evolution namely 
that of selection and

88
00:05:37,136 --> 00:05:41,123
natural selection. In particular
here, we even extended this idea to 

89
00:05:41,304 --> 00:05:45,479
a multispecies system that now 
competes with each other

90
00:05:45,648 --> 00:05:49,110
and creates these cyclical dynamics.

91
00:05:49,271 --> 00:05:53,459
So congratulations to 
this achievement.

92
00:05:53,789 --> 00:05:57,252
All right, so this concludes 
chapter six. You just learned about

93
00:05:57,422 --> 00:06:00,509
natural selection, the most 
important force in all of life.

94
00:06:00,672 --> 00:06:03,797
You learned about directional 
selection, balancing selection

95
00:06:03,952 --> 00:06:07,302
disruptive selection, negative 
frequency of dependence selection

96
00:06:07,477 --> 00:06:10,664
which gives rise to these 
co-evolutionary cycles and so on.

97
00:06:10,842 --> 00:06:15,792
And you did all of these by using 
fundamental programming concepts

98
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,785
that you learned about earlier on.

99
00:06:18,948 --> 00:06:22,435
Well, you did learn a few new 
concepts such as the while loop,

100
00:06:22,608 --> 00:06:25,833
and the ternary operator, 
but by and large, you were simply

101
00:06:26,004 --> 00:06:29,579
reusing things you've learned 
earlier, so just global variables,

102
00:06:29,883 --> 00:06:35,983
functions, data structures such as 
erase, iterations and many other

103
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,371
concepts.

104
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:40,878
And this is really kind of the key 
learning goal of this course

105
00:06:41,177 --> 00:06:46,402
to reason computationally, to take 
a language like java script, open a

106
00:06:46,593 --> 00:06:50,993
text editor, wonder about the world 
and you say, "Hmm, I wonder what

107
00:06:51,156 --> 00:06:54,281
would happen if these assumptions 
were met." And then you simple

108
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:57,357
create a quick simulation 
and see what the outcome is.

109
00:06:57,526 --> 00:07:01,764
That was really always the goal 
of this course and hope now at the

110
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:05,298
end of chapter six, you can see 
how powerful this can be

111
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:09,257
which is learn about the four
major force affecting evolution.

112
00:07:09,447 --> 00:07:14,647
Now, as we continue our journey 
into chapter seven, we will keep

113
00:07:14,821 --> 00:07:19,246
a focusing on multispecies models 
and quickly on host parasite

114
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:23,789
dynamics, but rather than asking 
ourselves about the genetic dynamics

115
00:07:23,992 --> 00:07:27,667
we will look at how 
infectious diseases can trigger

116
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:30,606
large scale epidemics.

117
00:07:30,772 --> 00:07:34,809
And this does not come as a 
surprise, so you we'll use of course

118
00:07:34,975 --> 00:07:38,675
java script to figure things out.
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
