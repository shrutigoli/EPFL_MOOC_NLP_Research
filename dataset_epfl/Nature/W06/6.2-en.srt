00:00:03,358 --> 00:00:04,845
Welcome back to Nature, In Code.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:06,462
We're in chapter 6, Lecture 2

3
00:00:06,635 --> 00:00:07,860
In the previous lecture 


4
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:10,032
we just learned about 
natural selection

5
00:00:10,209 --> 00:00:11,696
And that natural selection is 

6
00:00:11,883 --> 00:00:15,070
the consequence of alleles 
or phenotypes

7
00:00:15,242 --> 00:00:17,917
having differences in fitness.

8
00:00:18,136 --> 00:00:20,524
We modified a code example 

9
00:00:20,697 --> 00:00:22,597
that we developed in chapter three.

10
00:00:22,919 --> 00:00:25,094
And we gave one of the alleles 

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,429
a tiny selective advantage.

12
00:00:27,614 --> 00:00:29,014
And we saw the effect of that

13
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:32,202
Which was that this allele would 
very quickly go to fixation

14
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:34,361
Now in this lecture,

15
00:00:34,816 --> 00:00:35,990
I'd like to

16
00:00:36,176 --> 00:00:38,901
not assume anything other than
natural selection.

17
00:00:39,087 --> 00:00:41,750
So we're going back to
the world where we have

18
00:00:41,895 --> 00:00:43,232
no spacial consideration,

19
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,756
no mutation, an infinite
population size.

20
00:00:46,441 --> 00:00:47,741
so that we can understand

21
00:00:47,861 --> 00:00:50,861
natural selection as
a force in isolation.

22
00:00:51,372 --> 00:00:54,172
So let's go ahead and 
get our math hats on.

23
00:00:54,313 --> 00:00:58,251
So like before the math we're going
to develop is very straight forward.

24
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:02,331
Like before we're going to start
with the genotypes.

25
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:06,520
And we're going to denote the three
possible genotypes that we have.

26
00:01:07,239 --> 00:01:10,539
A1A1,  A1A2, and A2A2

27
00:01:10,662 --> 00:01:12,912
and we  can now ask ourselves okay,

28
00:01:13,016 --> 00:01:16,016
what is the fitness 
of these genotypes?

29
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:21,150
We're simply going to denote
the fitness's here as W11

30
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:23,095
for the A1A1 genotype.

31
00:01:23,298 --> 00:01:27,948
Denote W12 for the A1A2 genotype.

32
00:01:28,399 --> 00:01:31,812
And as W22 for the A2A2 genotype.

33
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:35,382
And then we can ask ourselves okay,

34
00:01:35,548 --> 00:01:39,785
what is the frequency at 
generation T of these genotypes?

35
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:42,824
We're going to assume

36
00:01:42,956 --> 00:01:45,956
that these genotypes are at 
Hardy-Weinberg frequencies.

37
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:50,110
So for A1A1 this would be p^2

38
00:01:50,764 --> 00:01:53,764
For A1A2 this  would be 2pq

39
00:01:54,088 --> 00:01:57,088
and for A2A2 this would be q^2.

40
00:01:57,531 --> 00:02:00,319
This is of course
nothing new for you.

41
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,848
Now the interesting question
we ask ourselves 

42
00:02:02,999 --> 00:02:05,849
what is the frequency of these
genotypes going to be 

43
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:07,669
in the next generation?

44
00:02:09,497 --> 00:02:10,947
So here what we have to do

45
00:02:11,116 --> 00:02:13,041
just like we did before in the codes

46
00:02:13,207 --> 00:02:18,295
We take  this frequency 
and we multiply it with the fitness.

47
00:02:18,678 --> 00:02:22,241
So here would be p^2 times W11

48
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,957
Here would be 2p^2 times W12.

49
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,448
And here would q^2 times W22.

50
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:37,880
Now the problem is that now
these numbers may not add up to 1.

51
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:40,273
These three numbers we know 
they add up to one

52
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:45,590
but these may now not so we have
to normalize those numbers first.

53
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:51,321
So we're simply going to divide it 
by a normalizing factor

54
00:02:51,402 --> 00:02:54,402
which here 
I'm going to denote as W bar.

55
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:58,968
And by the way this W bar is 
called the average fitness

56
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,268
but it is simply the sum 
of these three terms here.

57
00:03:03,561 --> 00:03:07,611
Alright, so it is simply p^2 W11

58
00:03:07,835 --> 00:03:15,947
plus 2pqW12 plus q^2W22

59
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:18,736
And this is of course
 a very common thing 

60
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,350
that you have to do when you have
a number of values 

61
00:03:23,738 --> 00:03:28,063
that you need to sum up and, then
 normalize so that they add up to 1.

62
00:03:28,277 --> 00:03:29,351
What you have to do is


63
00:03:29,557 --> 00:03:32,157
you simply have to divide 
each of these numbers

64
00:03:32,347 --> 00:03:35,384
by the sum of all of the numbers.

65
00:03:36,169 --> 00:03:38,168
Okay, so that's pretty
 straight forward.

66
00:03:38,356 --> 00:03:40,481
So let's make an example now.

67
00:03:40,902 --> 00:03:41,877
So let's say,

68
00:03:41,979 --> 00:03:45,017
Umm, I'm going to start here with 
genotype frequencies

69
00:03:45,163 --> 00:03:50,588
of 20%, 50% and
 then that has to be 30%

70
00:03:51,694 --> 00:03:54,931
And I'm now going to assume 
that fitness is 1 here

71
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:56,798
for the A1A1 genotype

72
00:03:57,508 --> 00:04:00,508
1.2 for the A1A2 genotype,

73
00:04:00,867 --> 00:04:05,530
and 1.5 for the A2A2 genotype.

74
00:04:06,711 --> 00:04:09,823
So what are the frequencies here?

75
00:04:09,987 --> 00:04:12,374
Well, I simply have to multiply
 these two numbers,

76
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:15,342
and then divide it by 
these normalizing factors.

77
00:04:15,464 --> 00:04:19,364
So I'm going to calculate 
this first here, this term here.

78
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:22,774
So p^2 times W11

79
00:04:22,845 --> 00:04:25,845
so that's 1 times 0.2 so that's 0.2.

80
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:34,505
Plus 2pq which is 0.5 times 1.2
so that's 0.6

81
00:04:35,036 --> 00:04:38,111
And we have q^2 times W22

82
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:41,267
So 0.3 times 1.5

83
00:04:41,417 --> 00:04:44,567
and that is 0.45

84
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,980
So we add those up, 
that is 1.25 here.

85
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:53,253
So this normalizing factor is 1.25.

86
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:57,245
So again you can see these three
terms without the normalizing factor

87
00:04:57,323 --> 00:05:00,086
would add up to more than one and
 that can obviously not be

88
00:05:00,213 --> 00:05:03,425
that's why we need to normalize 
these numbers in the first place.

89
00:05:04,172 --> 00:05:11,947
Okay, so 0.2 divided
by 1.25 is 0.16.

90
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:20,050
Here we have 0.6 divided by 1.25,
so that's 0.48.

91
00:05:20,406 --> 00:05:29,143
And here we have 0.45 
divided by 1.25, that's 0.36.

92
00:05:30,011 --> 00:05:33,261
And these are not exactly
the accurate numbers

93
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,835
I rounded them down to
2 significant digits here

94
00:05:38,015 --> 00:05:39,840
But that's good,
enough for the example.

95
00:05:40,014 --> 00:05:43,001
But in any case you can now see 
that these three numbers

96
00:05:43,089 --> 00:05:45,464
now again add up to 1.

97
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:49,254
Okay but now let's observe 
what actually happened

98
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:52,344
in terms of these 
genotypes frequencies.

99
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:54,922
So here we went from 0.2 to 0.16,

100
00:05:55,023 --> 00:05:58,661
so the genotype frequencies 
here went down.

101
00:05:58,946 --> 00:06:03,259
Here we went from 0.5 to 0.48, 
so it also went down.

102
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:04,739
Although just a little bit.

103
00:06:04,927 --> 00:06:09,477
And here we went from 0.3 to 0.36
 so this one went up.

104
00:06:10,946 --> 00:06:12,608
So that's now really interesting.

105
00:06:12,792 --> 00:06:15,792
So here this is in some sense
what we expected

106
00:06:15,924 --> 00:06:18,924
This was the genotype 
with the lowest fitness

107
00:06:19,317 --> 00:06:21,829
and so as a consequence 

108
00:06:21,971 --> 00:06:24,971
we expected the genotype frequencies
here to go up.

109
00:06:26,309 --> 00:06:28,859
This was the genotype with 
the highest fitness so,

110
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:32,757
so it kind of makes sense that 
we expect this genotype to go up.

111
00:06:33,266 --> 00:06:36,266
Here it was actually not
quite clear what would happen

112
00:06:36,955 --> 00:06:40,955
o some extent, this had the higher
 fitness than this genotype,

113
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:43,940
but it had the lower
 fitness than this genotype.

114
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:46,764
And we can now see 
in this particular example

115
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:50,928
that this genotype went down
in frequency a little bit.

116
00:06:52,331 --> 00:06:55,131
So this is how you calculate the
genotype frequencies

117
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:58,942
in the next generation
due to natural selection.

118
00:06:59,065 --> 00:07:00,802
So no more genetic drift here

119
00:07:00,937 --> 00:07:06,412
This is now the effect of 
these unequal frequencies.

120
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,530
And again the
absolute values here don't matter.

121
00:07:09,892 --> 00:07:13,004
We could put here 10, 12, and 15

122
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,070
you could do the math and 
it would have the exact same effect.

123
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:20,040
An interesting thought experiment

124
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,717
would be to now change these 
frequency values

125
00:07:22,878 --> 00:07:24,916
so that they are actually equal.

126
00:07:25,023 --> 00:07:27,148
So let's go ahead and do that.

127
00:07:27,437 --> 00:07:29,274
So let's assume that

128
00:07:30,348 --> 00:07:35,135
that here we want all of these
genotypes to have the same fitness.

129
00:07:35,298 --> 00:07:39,148
And for simplicity, we're simply 
going to put this at 1.

130
00:07:39,211 --> 00:07:43,436
Okay, so the assumption here is
that they all have fitness 1.

131
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,463
Again the absolute value's 
don't matter

132
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:47,822
even if they had a fitness of 2.
 It doesn't matter.

133
00:07:47,997 --> 00:07:49,759
What matters is that they're equal.

134
00:07:50,192 --> 00:07:57,092
These values here well we don't
 know yet if they'll go up or down.

135
00:07:58,326 --> 00:08:01,326
These values here we would 
have to recalculate.

136
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:03,048
So we're going to do this.

137
00:08:03,712 --> 00:08:06,112
And these therefore as a consequence

138
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:08,531
its normalizing factor
will be different.

139
00:08:08,704 --> 00:08:12,141
And of course the frequencies in
the next generation are going to be

140
00:08:12,306 --> 00:08:14,981
different. So we'll
recalculate those as well.

141
00:08:15,606 --> 00:08:17,706
Alright, so let's go ahead 
and do this.

142
00:08:19,661 --> 00:08:23,773
Here we have p^2 times W11
so that's 0.2.

143
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:28,578
Here we have 0.5  times 1, 
so that's 0.5.

144
00:08:28,802 --> 00:08:32,277
And here we have 0.3 times 1
so that's 0.3.

145
00:08:32,408 --> 00:08:35,620
So those numbers add up to 1.

146
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:36,518
So that's good.

147
00:08:36,673 --> 00:08:38,498
That essentially means that we don't

148
00:08:38,597 --> 00:08:40,372
have to normalize
 in the first place.

149
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,041
But of course we can still 
go ahead and fill these out.

150
00:08:43,113 --> 00:08:45,938
So this is 0.2 divided by 1.
That's 0.2.

151
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:49,771
This is 0.5 divided by 1. 
That's obviously 0.5.

152
00:08:49,929 --> 00:08:52,929
And 0.3 divided by 1
is also 0.3.

153
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:56,926
And so the kinda trivial 
outcome here now is that

154
00:08:57,446 --> 00:09:01,071
these values are in fact equal.

155
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:03,409
The genotype frequencies 
don't change 

156
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:07,591
and of course this is exactly what
we observed back in chapter 2

157
00:09:07,742 --> 00:09:10,017
when we looked at 
Hardy-Weinberg frequencies.

158
00:09:10,096 --> 00:09:15,346
In essence this is now 
the mathematical proof if you will

159
00:09:16,009 --> 00:09:19,009
for the Hardy-Weinberg principle
in the first place.

160
00:09:19,131 --> 00:09:24,169
So once you have these genotypes 
at Hardy Weinberg equilibrium

161
00:09:24,755 --> 00:09:27,167
and there's no natural selection

162
00:09:27,346 --> 00:09:30,484
which there is in here 
because the fitnessi are equal

163
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,782
then the genotype frequencies 
won't change and they don'there.

164
00:09:35,084 --> 00:09:37,672
So the next thing we're going 
to do in the next lecture

165
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,195
is look at the fate of the alleles

166
00:09:41,365 --> 00:09:44,828
Here we just calculated 
the fate of the genotypes?

167
00:09:44,948 --> 00:09:47,773
What is the frequency of genotypes 
in the next generation?

168
00:09:47,912 --> 00:09:49,400
So with that knowledge at hand,

169
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:52,489
let's go take a look at 
what happens at the alleles

170
00:09:52,655 --> 00:09:55,805
because that's ultimately 
our working definition of evolution.

171
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:59,049
The change of allele frequencies 
in a population over time.

172
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:02,782
I'll see you in the next lecture.
