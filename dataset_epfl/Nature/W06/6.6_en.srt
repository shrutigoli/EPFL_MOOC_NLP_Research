00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:07,050
Welcome back to Nature in Code.
We are now in Chapter 6 lecture 6.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:10,300
In this lecture we are gonna look
at the third type of selection,

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,640
namely that of Disruptive Selection.

4
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,870
So once again, let's go back to this slide,

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:16,320
we have to 3 genotypes.

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,030
We have to 3 finesses.

7
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,630
And here, we said
we get disruptive selection

8
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:23,080
when H is larger than 1,

9
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,100
which means that the 
heterozygote now has actually

10
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:27,560
the lowest fitness.

11
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,020
So this is more like a fitness valley.

12
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,430
So let's look what happens
when we implement this.

13
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,060
We have all the code in place now,

14
00:00:35,060 --> 00:00:39,460
all we need to do is essentially
to change the age in both files.

15
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:43,040
So let's go over to our code 
and modified this.

16
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,710
All right, here we are in the code.

17
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:46,440
I still have these 2 files open.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,760
Let's first go to delta P versus P,
so open that file if you haven't,

19
00:00:50,780 --> 00:00:55,120
and let's change here the H
to something that is larger than 1,

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,850
so let's change it to 1.5, for example.

21
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,390
And now to save this and let's go 
to the browser and reload this file

22
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,440
so here the tab has delta P
versus P, so let's reload this.

23
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,620
And here's what we get,

24
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,300
that's quite interesting, isn't it?

25
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:15,120
Because it seems like it's almost 
mirrored so what's happening here?

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:18,800
Well, let's take a look, 
so over here delta P is negative

27
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,320
and over here delta P positive

28
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:26,460
and again we seem to have
this valley here at delta P zero,

29
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:28,930
so some kind of equilibrium,

30
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,580
which is not the treble ones
P equals 1 and P equals zero.

31
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,060
So very interesting,
so let's see what happens here.

32
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:40,310
So let's assume we are
somewhere here in this area.

33
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,270
So now I am here at P

34
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,000
somebody says 0.2 or so,
and the delta P is negative,

35
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,480
that means I'm actually moving to 
the left because I'm reducing my P

36
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,140
and it keeps being negative
so I keep going over here

37
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,530
until I in fact reached zero
so I lose the allele,

38
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:58,710
very interesting.

39
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,620
So let's see or hear
what happens here

40
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:02,360
let's say I am at 0.3.

41
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,000
So now the delta P is positive.

42
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,110
So that means in the next generation 
my P slightly increased

43
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:09,750
by moving to the right here,

44
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,290
and because delta P
keeps being positive in this region.

45
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:16,590
I just keep moving to the right, 
to the right, to the right,

46
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:20,570
until, finally, I reached
in fact P equals 1,

47
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:23,320
so that's very interesting
when I start here,

48
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:28,570
P goes to succession and when
I start over here P seems to get lost.

49
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:30,290
So, very interesting dynamics

50
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:33,150
and there is something here
at this point,

51
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:37,240
which is probably 0.25,
P doesn't change,

52
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:40,420
but you can already see
given what's happening over here,

53
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,400
and over here.

54
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:44,300
Even if I'm exactly at this point,

55
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,340
if I could push just a little bit 
to the left or to the right.

56
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:51,030
I will immediately go to 
the other equilibrium,

57
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,790
so this doesn't seem like 
a stable equilibrium,

58
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:58,420
but let's just go ahead and find out
with our P versus time code.

59
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:01,190
So we're gonna go back
to the file "P versus time".

60
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:06,470
this is the one and
I'm just gonna set this aspect to 0.1

61
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,080
as we have before.

62
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:12,830
But here, importantly now
I want to change H to 1.5,

63
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:16,520
so something larger than 1,
so that we get disruptive selection.

64
00:03:16,520 --> 00:03:20,420
Now if I save this
and go over to the browser

65
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,240
and open the "P versus time"

66
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,750
and reload this,

67
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,820
Here's what we see.

68
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:27,250
This is really fascinating,

69
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:30,920
so this seems
to confirm our observation

70
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,790
that here when we start
with P values that are low

71
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:35,730
and lower down,

72
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:41,000
it seems like this 0.25 then 
we actually go down to zero.

73
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,180
So that means we lose the A1 allele,

74
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:44,480
on the other hand though,

75
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,200
if it's a larger than this 0.25 
value it seems to go to fixation

76
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,240
and here at this value, 0.25,

77
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:55,760
it seems like we're
in the stable equilibrium

78
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,550
so this confirms what
we observed with this other graph.

79
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:03,840
Now, so you could be tempted to think,

80
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:07,400
Ok, there are 3 possible outcomes 
it either goes to zero,

81
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,260
it either goes to 1 or
it stays at this equilibrium,

82
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,350
but the thing is,

83
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,600
again as we mentioned before,
when we look here at delta P versus P,

84
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,160
this equilibrium here
is not really stable.

85
00:04:18,210 --> 00:04:22,460
Yes, you could be at the point
where you are exactly at delta P zero

86
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:24,320
and then it will indeed be stable

87
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,190
but just the tiniest perturbation here
would push you to the left

88
00:04:28,190 --> 00:04:29,760
or to the right

89
00:04:29,760 --> 00:04:32,720
at which point Delta P
would not be zero anymore

90
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:38,110
and it would start this process
of either going down or going up here,

91
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:40,020
so it is not a stable equilibrium.

92
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:42,260
Can we somehow show this?

93
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:45,950
Yes we can, let's actually 
go back to our code.

94
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:48,090
So here's our P versus time code

95
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:51,830
and this is where we initialized
the initial p-values

96
00:04:51,830 --> 00:04:57,890
and so this just seems to be at
exactly at 0.01 and going up by 0.01

97
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,530
we know we will probably have
a bit of a rounding error

98
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:03,300
but it's mathematically
pretty insignificant,

99
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,110
but what we could do now is
we could say, "you know what?",

100
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:09,250
you know we're gonna have a roughly 
0.01 difference between

101
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,620
these initial P values,

102
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:13,690
but we arere just gonna add
a tiny bit of random noise

103
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:16,950
just to see what's happening here,
so, what I am going to do here is,

104
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,020
I am going to say you know what I want 
to add some randomness here

105
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,140
so I am going to add "math dot random",

106
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:26,240
but that alone, of course,
wouldn't be good,

107
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,560
because that would be a number
between zero and 1

108
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:31,980
and so the values here 
would be all over the place,

109
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,930
but I am simply now going to
multiply this number

110
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,820
with something very small,

111
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:40,350
so, 0.000001, for example.

112
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:44,440
I'm gonna put these here
in parentheses just so that it's clear.

113
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,940
So, what is happening now is,
"math random" as you know,

114
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,400
a valey between zero and 1

115
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,200
if you know multiply this
with his very small value

116
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,550
we now get a very small
but still random value

117
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,800
between zero
and this value here

118
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,800
and this tiny bit of noise

119
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:05,410
we are then gonna add here 
to our initial P value,

120
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,130
and so if we now save this
and go back to the browser

121
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,460
and go back top versus time
and reload this.

122
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:14,210
Here's what we see now,

123
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:20,120
so you can see this previouly
straight line actually goes up.

124
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,640
That's because we added 
a little bit of tiny noise

125
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:25,100
you will not be 
able to see this here,

126
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,030
but we're not at 0.25 exactly,

127
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:30,030
but a slightly higher,

128
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:33,160
just a tad bit of random noise that 
we added here a random value

129
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,280
between zero and 0.000001,

130
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,840
but that was enough to to 
give us this visual here.

131
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:45,590
In fact the did previous one 
vertix line was straight.

132
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:48,680
I'm pretty sure that
it we weren't exactly at 0.25

133
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:50,270
but there was some rounding error

134
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:53,890
and this would eventually
also have gone up,

135
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:56,110
but it would have taken a very long time,

136
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:58,440
so I wanted to add this 
this random noise here.

137
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:00,070
In fact, if you reload this,

138
00:07:00,070 --> 00:07:04,580
as you can see this curve is shifting 
a little bit to the left and right.

139
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:08,000
Why? Well, because there's
a little bit of random noise here

140
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,180
and because it's random,

141
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:12,800
it's always as a slight difference 
between these 2 values.

142
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,940
No two P values here in the beginning 
are going to be the same between reloads

143
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:20,970
and that's why you get 
the slight shift here in the curve

144
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,980
so it's still flat for a long time.

145
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:24,830
Why is that?

146
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:27,380
Well, if you go over to delta P versus P,

147
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,490
in fact if you are here,
exactly at 0.25, delta P is zero,

148
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:36,390
but if you just a tiny, tiny bit
below or above that value,

149
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,540
then delta P is not going to be zero,

150
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:43,600
but it's still going to be
extremely small for a long time.

151
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,750
And that is why, even though things 
are actually changing here in P,

152
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,960
they're so small,

153
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,560
the changes are so small
that we cannot visually perceive this

154
00:07:52,730 --> 00:07:53,870
here on this scale,

155
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:56,370
but it is happening
just very, very slowly,

156
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:01,030
and eventually this hits this spot 
where it's really starting to take off,

157
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,060
so suddenly we are really 
getting into this area here.

158
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:07,450
And then, or rather here
actually, we're going positive.

159
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:10,500
And finally, this process will accelerate.

160
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:15,450
And then, of course,
slow down again as we approach 1.

161
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,440
so this is disruptive selection

162
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:23,630
and this is to me, kind of the most
fascinating type of selection,

163
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,080
because we get, even though
this is a deterministic model,

164
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,960
we get two possible types of outcome.

165
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:31,580
And this is interesting, isn't it?

166
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:35,780
because we think often of evolution 
as this deterministic process

167
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:38,850
we now know that this is not true at all,

168
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:42,800
given the effects of drift and of 
mutation also, which is random,

169
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,400
but still here,

170
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:48,980
you would say okay I start
with a certain population

171
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:53,010
and certain frequencies
are always gonna go in the same direction

172
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:54,410
and that is true,

173
00:08:54,410 --> 00:08:58,480
but if as soon as you change
the values here it's not true anymore.

174
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,170
It can go either way,
either of the extreme ways

175
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:05,640
so this really depends on
the initial conditions here

176
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,330
and that's a key feature
of disruptive selection

177
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:12,020
that you will get very different outcomes.

178
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:14,030
You will lose one of the alleles,

179
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:18,580
but which one you lose depends
completely on where you start.

180
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,570
So what about this value here?

181
00:09:20,570 --> 00:09:23,520
Can we actually calculate
where does change happens?

182
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:27,010
Where, if you're above you're gonna go
to fixation if you're below.

183
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:30,580
We're gonna go to 
fixation of the other allele

184
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:33,880
and yet turns out this can actually be
calculated as well.

185
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:38,680
So it turns out this point is actually 
calculated in the exact same way,

186
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,550
so it is also calculated as
H minus 1 divided by 2H minus 1.

187
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:49,900
and if we now put in
the corresponding value of H equal to 1.5

188
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,020
then what we get here is slightly changed,

189
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:56,490
we get 1.5 minus 1,
that's of course 0.5.

190
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:00,640
We get 2 times 1.5 which 
is 3 minus 1, which is 2

191
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:07,690
and so 0.5 divided by 2 is exactly this 
2.5 that we observed in the simulations.

192
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:12,420
Okay, so this finishes our treatment
of the 3 types of selections

193
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:15,030
that saw here in these different graphs.

194
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,900
so quite interesting,
if we have directional selection

195
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:21,300
we will only ever go in one direction,

196
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,010
one of the alleles will be fixed 
and it's very clear which one

197
00:10:25,010 --> 00:10:27,920
In the case of balancing selection.

198
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,910
None of the alleles goes to fixation,

199
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,500
but we will go to some
sort of intermediary value.

200
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,870
And in the case of disruptive selection.

201
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,020
One of the alleles will go to fixation,

202
00:10:37,020 --> 00:10:41,810
but which one it is, very much
depends here on the initial of value

203
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,520
of the allele frequencies.

204
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,930
So this now concludes our treatment 
of these 3 types of selection:

205
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,560
directional selection,
balancing selection,

206
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:53,530
and disruptive selection.

207
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,760
very fascinating, very different outcomes

208
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,420
depending on the fitness
of the heterozygote.

209
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:02,710
In the next lecture we'll get to know
a new type of selection.

210
00:11:02,710 --> 00:11:06,870
And that is when actually many species 
start to interact with each other

211
00:11:06,870 --> 00:11:10,240
and start to interact with 
each other's fitnesses.

212
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,800
In this case you have
something called coevolution

213
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,560
and that's a really fascinating
phenomenon as well.

214
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:18,487
So let's take a look in the next 
lecture. I'll see you there.
