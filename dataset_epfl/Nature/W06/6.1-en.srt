00:00:03,877 --> 00:00:07,789
Welcome back. Nature, In Code. 
We're in chapter six, lecture one.

2
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:10,964
Chapter six is all about
natural selection.

3
00:00:11,155 --> 00:00:15,605
Natural selection has been dubbed 
the best idea anyone has ever had.

4
00:00:15,778 --> 00:00:17,741
 A statement I do agree with.

5
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:22,428
Natural selection often equated 
with evolution, but as you now know,

6
00:00:22,602 --> 00:00:26,214
this is not entirely true because 
as we've seen, there are other

7
00:00:26,396 --> 00:00:29,058
forces that can affect 
allele frequencies.

8
00:00:29,298 --> 00:00:33,686
But nevertheless, natural selection 
does stand out so much so that 

9
00:00:33,853 --> 00:00:38,228
people do equate it with evolution.
So why is that? Let's find out.

10
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,825
Natural selection is the only 
force capable of producing

11
00:00:43,016 --> 00:00:46,754
adaptive traits. 
So what is an adaptive trait?

12
00:00:47,297 --> 00:00:51,772
Well, an adaptive trait is one 
that makes the individual

13
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:55,908
with that trait well adapted to the 
environment it lives in.

14
00:00:56,087 --> 00:00:59,712
But again, what does that 
actually mean? We have a good

15
00:00:59,891 --> 00:01:03,366
sense of you know, of being adapted 
but what does it mean in

16
00:01:03,543 --> 00:01:04,980
the evolutionary context?

17
00:01:05,153 --> 00:01:10,128
Well it simply means that all else 
being equal an individual

18
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:15,667
with the trait is more likely 
to survive and produce offspring

19
00:01:15,849 --> 00:01:18,312
than individuals without the trait.

20
00:01:19,211 --> 00:01:23,036
So you take individuals that are 
identical, everything about them, 

21
00:01:23,201 --> 00:01:26,489
their situation, the environment, 
everything is exactly identical 

22
00:01:26,669 --> 00:01:30,169
except some of the individuals have
that trait and some of them

23
00:01:30,344 --> 00:01:31,232
don't have it

24
00:01:32,147 --> 00:01:36,959
If that trait, having that trait 
means that these individuals

25
00:01:37,127 --> 00:01:40,452
are more likely to survive and 
produce offspring, then

26
00:01:40,628 --> 00:01:42,840
we're talking about 
an adaptive trait.

27
00:01:43,383 --> 00:01:45,183
So I'm going to give 
you an example. 

28
00:01:47,108 --> 00:01:50,745
Natural selection produces 
stunning adaptations

29
00:01:50,924 --> 00:01:53,899
and this is one of the most 
stunning I personally know of,

30
00:01:54,078 --> 00:01:55,441
but there are many, many more.

31
00:01:55,627 --> 00:01:58,077
This is an example of mimicry.

32
00:01:58,265 --> 00:02:01,615
So here if you look closely,
you can see an insect.

33
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:06,503
This is a leaf katydid 
and it's perhaps a little bit hard 

34
00:02:06,679 --> 00:02:10,229
to see on first sight, 
but here you have the legs,

35
00:02:10,404 --> 00:02:14,429
six legs, the head, the antenna, 
and here are the wings.

36
00:02:15,167 --> 00:02:17,979
 And this here is a leaf, 
but this is not a leaf.

37
00:02:18,164 --> 00:02:20,951
This is actually part of animal, 
part of the insect,

38
00:02:21,477 --> 00:02:23,977
really a stunning adaptation here. 

39
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:28,416
Clearly something like this cannot 
come about through random genetic

40
00:02:28,601 --> 00:02:30,713
drift or mutation alone.

41
00:02:30,886 --> 00:02:34,111
So the force that can create 
something like this is that of

42
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:37,731
adaptation through natural 
selection, because just as you

43
00:02:37,912 --> 00:02:41,787
 had a hard time perhaps recognizing
this image of the first sight.

44
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:46,219
Now, imagine you are a bird 
flying over a forest say you

45
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:50,943
would have a very hard time 
seeing this type insect.

46
00:02:51,122 --> 00:02:55,022
And so you would miss out on 
launch here, which is bad for you

47
00:02:55,192 --> 00:03:00,217
as a bird, but it is very good 
for the fitness of this individual.

48
00:03:00,782 --> 00:03:03,957
So let's think about how this 
could play out and I'm not

49
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:08,338
just obviously going to over 
simplify a lot, but the model

50
00:03:08,528 --> 00:03:09,966
 is the correct one.

51
00:03:10,162 --> 00:03:12,949
So imagine now, okay, 
we would have a forest.

52
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:16,401
This would be the forest from 
a bird's eye view.

53
00:03:16,581 --> 00:03:19,268
And now we would have a 
bunch of katydids 

54
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:26,275
and let's in the beginning, 
they happen to have yellow wings.

55
00:03:26,465 --> 00:03:29,190
And so here are a bunch 
of yellow

56
00:03:29,796 --> 00:03:31,208
of yellow

57
00:03:32,204 --> 00:03:33,367
 katydids.

58
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,428
And so as you can see, 
the birds will find it relatively

59
00:03:37,616 --> 00:03:41,228
easy to see those insects, 
and would have found it very easy

60
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:46,378
you know, to go hunt them 
and basically eat them for launch.

61
00:03:46,576 --> 00:03:52,539
Now, imagine a mutation comes 
along one day a katydid

62
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,425
produces offspring and its offspring
has a genetic mutation,

63
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,986
and that genetic mutation affects 
the leaf coloring in such a way

64
00:04:02,142 --> 00:04:04,992
that it is now green. 

65
00:04:06,087 --> 00:04:08,875
Now this katydid is harder to see.

66
00:04:09,064 --> 00:04:12,564
 It's not impossible but all else 
being equal, this is harder to see.

67
00:04:12,744 --> 00:04:15,919
So when the birds come along 
and start eating and start feasting

68
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,958
on some of these katydids, this one 
is much less likely to be eaten. 

69
00:04:20,597 --> 00:04:23,510
So, you know a few others 
would be eaten.

70
00:04:24,987 --> 00:04:29,400
The remaining ones will go 
ahead and reproduce

71
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,763
and to create offspring and so 
of course, does the green one.

72
00:04:35,168 --> 00:04:39,219
Now, in the next generation again, 
the birds come along 

73
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:43,601
and start eating some of these 
katydids, and again,

74
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:46,540
they would predominantly eat 
the yellow ones because 

75
00:04:46,718 --> 00:04:48,330
they are much easier to find.

76
00:04:48,501 --> 00:04:51,901
And then when reproduction 
time comes along, again,

77
00:04:52,073 --> 00:04:56,260
we have you know, the yellow 
katydids reproducing but we

78
00:04:56,446 --> 00:04:59,608
also have the green 
ones reproducing. 

79
00:04:59,783 --> 00:05:02,483
And you can already see 
what's happening here.

80
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:08,521
So already, the frequency of 
the responsible mutation here,

81
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:13,996
this new allele that contributes 
to this green color

82
00:05:14,177 --> 00:05:18,002
has increased in frequency, 
which in other words means

83
00:05:18,173 --> 00:05:22,973
that evolution has occurred 
by our definition. 

84
00:05:23,268 --> 00:05:28,918
But in this case, this wasn't due 
to genetic drift, but this was

85
00:05:29,087 --> 00:05:32,200
due to natural selection, 

86
00:05:33,879 --> 00:05:38,267
because this particular allele, the
bearer, the individuals with that 

87
00:05:38,449 --> 00:05:42,737
allele are more likely to survive 
and reproduce than the ones

88
00:05:42,906 --> 00:05:47,131
without the allele. And that is 
then according to our definition 

89
00:05:47,313 --> 00:05:49,250
natural selection.

90
00:05:49,446 --> 00:05:52,959
Now, from a genetic perspective 
so far in our model world,

91
00:05:53,139 --> 00:05:57,226
right, we have assumed these
two alleles, A1 and A2,

92
00:05:57,406 --> 00:06:01,593
but for all intense purposes, 
these two alleles were considered

93
00:06:01,779 --> 00:06:06,454
 equal in terms of their effects 
they have on the bearers.

94
00:06:06,627 --> 00:06:12,115
There was no effect in terms of 
reproducing, in terms of surviving

95
00:06:12,354 --> 00:06:15,379
given by one of those alleles.

96
00:06:15,546 --> 00:06:17,558
They were considered equal.

97
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:21,002
 So in other words, another ways 
to express this is that their

98
00:06:21,175 --> 00:06:25,163
evolutionary fitness was equal.

99
00:06:28,129 --> 00:06:32,254
Their ability to survive and 
reproduce which is what fitness is,

100
00:06:32,438 --> 00:06:36,438
 was equal. And by the way this is 
not an absolute value.

101
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:39,679
This is always relative to what 
else is around,

102
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:43,052
but their fitness, their ability to 
reproduce and survive

103
00:06:44,011 --> 00:06:45,198
was equal

104
00:06:45,377 --> 00:06:50,502
Now, this chapter is very special 
in one, a key assumption

105
00:06:50,689 --> 00:06:54,551
which is that we now make this 
assumption that this is not

106
00:06:54,735 --> 00:07:00,235
true anymore, and when this is 
not true anymore, then you have

107
00:07:00,405 --> 00:07:01,668
natural selection.

108
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,098
At the moment when alleles 
have different fitnesses,

109
00:07:06,286 --> 00:07:09,449
that's when natural 
selection occurs.

110
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:13,149
And I want to do something now 
very straight forward.

111
00:07:13,336 --> 00:07:16,411
I want to go to code that 
we've already produced,

112
00:07:16,587 --> 00:07:22,362
where the implicit assumption 
was that the alleles had the exact

113
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:26,316
same fitness. We're going to make 
a small modification in the code 

114
00:07:26,485 --> 00:07:30,385
that leads to those two alleles 
not having the same fitness anymore,

115
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:33,026
and then we'll see what 
happens as a consequence.

116
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:36,456
All right, what would like you 
to do is to open this file genetic

117
00:07:36,654 --> 00:07:40,891
drift or the HTML that we 
developed early in chapter three.

118
00:07:41,105 --> 00:07:44,180
So I already have it opened here 
but you should just simply find

119
00:07:44,359 --> 00:07:47,321
it under the code examples. 

120
00:07:47,645 --> 00:07:49,558
Here it's called genetic drift.

121
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,815
That's the file. Simply open it.

122
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:54,359
I already have it open 
so here it is.

123
00:07:54,563 --> 00:07:58,550
And if you open this in the browser,
you may recall that we ended

124
00:07:58,738 --> 00:08:01,038
the genetic drift chapter.

125
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:05,978
Let's do this here as well, open
file, code examples, genetic drift.

126
00:08:06,251 --> 00:08:12,739
We ended it with the bottle necks, 
and so that's why it takes a second 

127
00:08:12,929 --> 00:08:17,866
or so to load. It's because we have 
a very large population outside of

128
00:08:18,051 --> 00:08:20,289
the bottle necks and that's why
it takes so long.

129
00:08:20,469 --> 00:08:25,307
 So this is our genetic drift 
simulation where we left off

130
00:08:25,474 --> 00:08:26,836
 in chapter three.

131
00:08:26,956 --> 00:08:30,744
Now go back to the code 
and so let's now get rid

132
00:08:30,934 --> 00:08:32,472
of these bottle necks.

133
00:08:32,635 --> 00:08:36,673
So first of all, let's store these 
files here under a new version,

134
00:08:36,857 --> 00:08:41,070
so we're going to save this as-- 
in code examples. I'm going to 

135
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:52,549
call this drift and selection.html. 

136
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:57,335
All right, so once you have 
saved this, remove the bottle necks,

137
00:08:57,532 --> 00:09:03,244
so these lines here, these six lines
where we set the population size

138
00:09:03,428 --> 00:09:07,466
 to 10 or otherwise to N, 
let's remove these so

139
00:09:07,637 --> 00:09:09,887
we don't have bottle necks anymore.

140
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,093
And also be sure here to 
set the population size

141
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:16,274
to N and this is just going 
to be fixed in this case.

142
00:09:17,072 --> 00:09:20,059
All right, the other thing that 
we should do is

143
00:09:20,224 --> 00:09:24,087
we should go up to the global 
variables and set your N

144
00:09:24,267 --> 00:09:27,205
back to something more 
reasonable. Let's say 2,000

145
00:09:27,381 --> 00:09:31,356
and you know, we can maybe
do this for 200 generations.

146
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:35,957
All right, so let's save this

147
00:09:36,732 --> 00:09:39,219
and open this again 
in the browser.

148
00:09:39,397 --> 00:09:42,497
So we already have the file open
but it is now a different file.

149
00:09:42,724 --> 00:09:51,687
It's now called drift up, 
drifts and selection HMO.

150
00:09:51,849 --> 00:09:54,661
You can open it from the menu 
or you can just type is her

151
00:09:54,850 --> 00:09:56,500
 in the address bar.

152
00:09:56,823 --> 00:09:58,923
And this is now what we expect.

153
00:09:59,086 --> 00:10:02,598
This is of course our average 
standard genetic drift

154
00:10:02,768 --> 00:10:05,218
simulation and if I repeat 
this a couple of times.

155
00:10:05,396 --> 00:10:09,183
You've seen this over and over 
again in chapter three.

156
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:13,362
This is the typical 
drift dynamic.

157
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:18,227
You have the alleles that start 
to you know, change in frequency 

158
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:23,113
go up or down simple due 
to a random sampling effect

159
00:10:23,577 --> 00:10:27,152
And you can also see here that 
200 generations is by no means

160
00:10:27,329 --> 00:10:31,754
enough to get rid of one of 
the alleles or have one of the

161
00:10:31,935 --> 00:10:36,135
alleles go to fixation rather. 
But we now know that this will

162
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:39,154
eventually happen if 
we gave it enough time.

163
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:41,407
All right, so this is 
genetic drift. 

164
00:10:41,589 --> 00:10:43,039
We know about genetic drift.

165
00:10:43,231 --> 00:10:48,581
Now, let's go back to the code 
and implement a very small change.

166
00:10:48,769 --> 00:10:52,494
So here we're back in the code, 
now we will like to implement 

167
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:55,932
natural selection here. 
So how are we going to do this?

168
00:10:56,108 --> 00:10:59,370
Well, it turns out that we only 
have to change a single line

169
00:10:59,542 --> 00:11:02,580
and the money is here, 
so this is in the next generation

170
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:08,175
function, and this is the line that 
says if math random is smaller

171
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:14,130
or equal to P. So here we pick A1 
alleles based on their frequency,

172
00:11:14,312 --> 00:11:18,012
and as you now know, that 
also means, you know due to these

173
00:11:18,191 --> 00:11:22,528
lines here else  you know, 
we pick an A2 allele also means

174
00:11:22,716 --> 00:11:26,078
that we pick an A2
allele simply based on its frequency.

175
00:11:26,403 --> 00:11:29,028
So that means we have no 
natural selection because

176
00:11:29,215 --> 00:11:33,240
we are simply picking these alleles 
based on their frequencies.

177
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:36,358
So these two alleles, 
they are selectively neutral.

178
00:11:36,547 --> 00:11:38,197
They have the exact same fitness. 

179
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,830
None has an advantage 
over the other.

180
00:11:41,014 --> 00:11:43,852
We simply pick them 
according to their frequency.

181
00:11:44,143 --> 00:11:47,331
But now let's modify this 
ever so lightly.

182
00:11:47,507 --> 00:11:51,257
Let's just go ahead here 
and write if this is smaller

183
00:11:51,432 --> 00:11:55,757
or equal to P times 1.01.

184
00:11:56,805 --> 00:12:00,880
So this is a seemingly small change,
certainly a very small change

185
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,170
 in terms of code, 
but it will have a huge effect.

186
00:12:04,483 --> 00:12:08,008
So save this code, 
just save the document,

187
00:12:08,192 --> 00:12:12,042
go back to the browser, 
take a good look at this, okay.

188
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:15,057
So this is genetic drift alone 
and now reload

189
00:12:15,229 --> 00:12:19,841
this document and boom.
Very different outcome,

190
00:12:20,015 --> 00:12:23,340
very different outcome 
and this is natural selection.

191
00:12:23,525 --> 00:12:26,325
So let's reload here a couple 
of times and they will always

192
00:12:26,509 --> 00:12:29,534
look the same. Of course, we'll 
have a little bit of variation,

193
00:12:29,698 --> 00:12:33,361
but the dynamics are 
always the same.

194
00:12:33,523 --> 00:12:37,060
Within a couple of generations, 
60, 80 generations,

195
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:40,224
the A1 allele will go to fixation

196
00:12:40,409 --> 00:12:47,059
So very, very different outcome 
based a tiny change in the code.

197
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:49,623
So let's go back to the code 
and take a closer

198
00:12:49,801 --> 00:12:51,589
look at this change.

199
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:54,159
So what does this change do?

200
00:12:54,359 --> 00:12:56,646
We are now picking-- 
we are simply picking

201
00:12:56,834 --> 00:13:01,572
the A1 allele a little bit more 
often at then based on its

202
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:06,148
 frequency alone. Ever so slightly, 
in fact, only 1%

203
00:13:06,315 --> 00:13:10,502
more often than we would do 
based on its frequency alone.

204
00:13:10,679 --> 00:13:16,891
As a consequence we would choose 
to pick the A2 allele slightly

205
00:13:17,089 --> 00:13:21,864
less frequently than we would
base on its frequency alone.

206
00:13:22,042 --> 00:13:25,542
And that is exactly what 
selection means, so we now

207
00:13:25,717 --> 00:13:28,592
give this a preferential
 treatment so to speak.

208
00:13:28,772 --> 00:13:31,835
We select this preferentially. 
And in other words what this

209
00:13:32,007 --> 00:13:36,607
now means, because we have here
our survival and reproduction built

210
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:43,137
into one simple step. These alleles 
now have a slight fitness advantage

211
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:44,535
 over these alleles. 

212
00:13:44,716 --> 00:13:48,791
So A1 has now a slightly higher 
fitness and it is at a selective

213
00:13:48,975 --> 00:13:54,000
advantage. And that even though 
it's a very small advantage

214
00:13:54,187 --> 00:13:59,899
 has a tremendously large effect
as you saw in the browser.

215
00:14:01,176 --> 00:14:05,901
So if we go back to the browser 
we can see here that the lines

216
00:14:06,089 --> 00:14:11,876
The frequencies are sometimes 
still going down and then

217
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:13,836
going up and so on. 
Why is that?

218
00:14:14,008 --> 00:14:17,371
Well, it is because we now drift 
and the natural selection,

219
00:14:17,541 --> 00:14:20,704
so both forces are acting 
at the same time.

220
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:24,225
And this is something that you 
commonly observe because

221
00:14:24,417 --> 00:14:28,817
populations are always finite 
in reality and so you will always

222
00:14:28,999 --> 00:14:32,224
have this effect of genetic drift.

223
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:37,463
However, as you can see here
the effect of natural selection

224
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:43,126
completely overwhelms the effect 
of genetic drift in this case.

225
00:14:43,991 --> 00:14:47,454
So in the real world, it's often 
very interesting to look at these

226
00:14:47,628 --> 00:14:51,003
effects in combination. Now, we 
could create and we will create 

227
00:14:51,195 --> 00:14:54,933
a model where we have an 
infinite population size,

228
00:14:55,119 --> 00:14:59,432
where we will have no genetic drift 
effects, and then we will simply

229
00:14:59,599 --> 00:15:03,974
see these straight lines, and they
 will always be exactly identical

230
00:15:04,143 --> 00:15:07,718
because you can then mathematically
precisely predict what these

231
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:12,571
trajectories look like. He we still 
have sort of the stochastic effect

232
00:15:12,743 --> 00:15:14,305
 of genetic drift.

233
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:20,456
Now, I just said here, okay, so 
in this example, natural selection

234
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:25,276
clearly is the dominating force, 
but that doesn't necessarily needs

235
00:15:25,461 --> 00:15:28,923
 to be the case. In fact, if we go 
back to the code and start

236
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:33,321
and start the simulation here, 
another P05, but you know

237
00:15:33,488 --> 00:15:38,300
lets go back to the code and
maybe lets set this in fact to P.1.

238
00:15:38,481 --> 00:15:42,531
So let's say the frequency in the 
beginning of the A1 allele is 10%. 

239
00:15:42,707 --> 00:15:45,819
So let's say this. 
Let's go back to the browser.

240
00:15:45,995 --> 00:15:47,720
Let's reload this.

241
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,893
So similar dynamics, right, 
is very clear that these

242
00:15:52,074 --> 00:15:55,611
alleles will eventually all go 
into these simulations.

243
00:15:55,783 --> 00:15:59,358
The A1 allele will always go 
to fixation here in these 

244
00:15:59,521 --> 00:16:01,459
simulation runs.

245
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:05,586
It does happen though with 
more uncertainty as you can see

246
00:16:05,774 --> 00:16:08,649
 here in this line. 
This line somehow seems to be

247
00:16:08,811 --> 00:16:11,911
 going down for quite a while. 
It doesn't quite crash,

248
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,041
but this could potentially happen. 

249
00:16:15,216 --> 00:16:19,154
So the effects of drift even though 
they are small here, they can have

250
00:16:19,335 --> 00:16:23,347
the effect that we can actually 
lose this allele before a natural

251
00:16:23,515 --> 00:16:25,440
selection can really fully kick in.

252
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:29,039
Let's reload this a couple of times
and now you have less here,

253
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:33,752
but as you can see this here very
closer, very close to extinction.

254
00:16:33,925 --> 00:16:37,113
This could have eventually 
happened here. This could eventually

255
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:40,634
happen. Well, doesn't happen. 
Oh, very close to extinction. 

256
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:43,698
You know let's go back to the 
code and set this to a slightly

257
00:16:43,885 --> 00:16:48,235
lower value. 
Let's set this here to .05.

258
00:16:48,415 --> 00:16:52,103
Okay, go back to the browser, 
still doesn't happen,

259
00:16:52,286 --> 00:16:55,286
still doesn't happen here. 
I'm going to reload this,

260
00:16:55,456 --> 00:17:00,206
a couple of times and then I'll 
see if this will eventually happen.

261
00:17:00,449 --> 00:17:02,536
It really should. 
I think here it happened.

262
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:05,150
 It's not very clear.

263
00:17:05,320 --> 00:17:12,407
We can see it's clearly. 
All right, so very interesting.

264
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:16,512
Almost happened here, 
almost happened.

265
00:17:16,686 --> 00:17:20,711
All right, you know what. I'm going 
to set this value even lower.

266
00:17:20,895 --> 00:17:24,370
I'm going to go back to the browser,
sorry to the text editor and

267
00:17:24,563 --> 00:17:27,376
I'm going to set this to 2%, 
and I'm pretty sure it will see

268
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:31,596
it quite often. Okay, reload. 
Yeah, so here we can see it's

269
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:35,183
happened here at least once, 
here again it happened.

270
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,810
The others went on and 
these would probably go to fixation.

271
00:17:38,977 --> 00:17:41,489
It's not clear the fate of 
this one here. It's not clear

272
00:17:41,653 --> 00:17:44,866
enough this one either, but 
those obviously will go to fixation.

273
00:17:45,026 --> 00:17:47,076
And so I think it's a great example.

274
00:17:47,295 --> 00:17:51,783
Here in the beginning the 
effects of drift, they are not 

275
00:17:51,953 --> 00:17:54,153
stronger here than they
 would be up here.

276
00:17:54,319 --> 00:17:57,531
You can still see you have the 
same kinds of fluctuations up here,

277
00:17:57,701 --> 00:18:01,364
but here they can really affect the 
ultimate dynamics of the population,

278
00:18:01,534 --> 00:18:08,071
because we could actually lose 
the allele in this stage.

279
00:18:08,245 --> 00:18:12,982
Once we are on this trajectory 
it's very, very unlikely that

280
00:18:13,150 --> 00:18:17,200
drift will be able to overpower 
the force of natural selection, but

281
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:20,758
in the beginning when your alleles
are rare, the effects of drift

282
00:18:20,928 --> 00:18:22,303
 can still be quite strong.

283
00:18:22,732 --> 00:18:25,620
Okay and you can see this 
happen over and over again.

284
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:30,888
So this is drift and 
natural selection together. 

285
00:18:31,062 --> 00:18:34,250
So the take away message 
here is that selection

286
00:18:34,425 --> 00:18:38,575
when natural selection occurs,  when
alleles have different fitnesses

287
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:42,618
and these differences can be very, 
very small on paper

288
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:45,143
but they can have huge effects.

289
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:49,742
And so this is evolution by 
natural selection and now,

290
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:52,621
what we'd like to do in the 
next couple of videos

291
00:18:52,804 --> 00:18:57,542
before we go back to coding, is to 
get a better quantitative handle

292
00:18:57,712 --> 00:18:59,637
on this process.
