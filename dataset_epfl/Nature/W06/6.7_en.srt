00:00:02,757 --> 00:00:04,337
Welcome back: Nature, In Code.

2
00:00:04,337 --> 00:00:06,277
We're in Chapter 6, Lecture 7.

3
00:00:06,911 --> 00:00:10,281
In this chapter, so far we've learned
about natural selection,

4
00:00:10,281 --> 00:00:12,151
evolution by natural selection,

5
00:00:12,151 --> 00:00:14,561
and what happens when we have alleles,

6
00:00:14,561 --> 00:00:17,031
we package these alleles
together in genotypes

7
00:00:17,031 --> 00:00:19,501
and then these genotypes
have different fitnesses.

8
00:00:19,953 --> 00:00:21,003
Well, we've learned

9
00:00:21,003 --> 00:00:23,343
that depending on exactly 
what those fitnesses are,

10
00:00:23,343 --> 00:00:24,603
relative to each other,

11
00:00:24,603 --> 00:00:27,643
we get the very different
evolutionary outcomes.

12
00:00:28,205 --> 00:00:31,945
But in this chapter so far, 
and in fact in the entire course so far,

13
00:00:31,945 --> 00:00:33,995
we've made the simplifying assumption

14
00:00:33,995 --> 00:00:38,145
that we're only focusing on a single
population in a single species.

15
00:00:38,145 --> 00:00:40,725
And now we're going to relax 
this assumption a little bit

16
00:00:40,725 --> 00:00:42,485
and we're going to assume 
that there are in fact,

17
00:00:42,485 --> 00:00:45,055
two populations and two species,

18
00:00:45,055 --> 00:00:47,805
and they interact in interesting ways

19
00:00:47,805 --> 00:00:51,195
giving rise to a phenomenon
called co-evolution.

20
00:00:51,195 --> 00:00:52,345
So let's get going.

21
00:00:52,345 --> 00:00:56,775
So far, we have assumed that fitness, 
i.e. the ability to survive and reproduce,

22
00:00:56,775 --> 00:00:58,082
it's a fixed value,

23
00:00:58,082 --> 00:01:01,482
but it's very easy to see 
that this isn't always the case.

24
00:01:01,482 --> 00:01:05,106
Consider for example a 
predator-prey system.

25
00:01:06,526 --> 00:01:09,616
These two species depend 
crucially on each other,

26
00:01:09,616 --> 00:01:13,776
and the fitnesses depend crucially
on who else is around.

27
00:01:14,306 --> 00:01:18,756
The fitness of a predator 
depends on the ability to spot prey.

28
00:01:18,756 --> 00:01:21,295
The fitness of the prey 
depends on the ability

29
00:01:21,295 --> 00:01:23,455
to avoid being spotted by predators.

30
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:30,499
And so, fitness can mean being adapted,
well adapted to a biotic environment

31
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:33,489
that can be affected 
by being well adapted

32
00:01:33,489 --> 00:01:35,569
to an abiotic environment,

33
00:01:35,569 --> 00:01:38,419
but often the environment 
is, in fact, biotic,

34
00:01:38,419 --> 00:01:42,479
and is composed of other species,
and if that's the case,

35
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,899
this can lead to something
called co-evolution.

36
00:01:46,818 --> 00:01:50,948
So evolution, again meaning 
change of allele frequencies.

37
00:01:50,948 --> 00:01:52,858
But now it's co-evolution,

38
00:01:52,858 --> 00:01:57,058
which means we have changes 
in allele frequencies in multiple species

39
00:01:57,058 --> 00:02:01,428
that crucially depend on each other
in one way or another.

40
00:02:02,805 --> 00:02:07,135
A really interesting 
general system of co-evolution

41
00:02:07,135 --> 00:02:10,255
is that of a host/parasite situation.

42
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:14,405
So, a host/parasite system 
where a parasite needs to infect the host

43
00:02:14,405 --> 00:02:16,235
in order to reproduce,

44
00:02:16,235 --> 00:02:19,985
and vice versa, a host 
has a reduced fitness

45
00:02:19,985 --> 00:02:22,155
when it's infected by a parasite,

46
00:02:22,155 --> 00:02:27,155
and higher fitness if it can avoid 
being infected by a parasite.

47
00:02:27,155 --> 00:02:31,155
So, assume here we have
some host individuals,

48
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:35,303
these host individuals 
are doing just fine normally,

49
00:02:35,303 --> 00:02:39,063
but then occasionally 
get infected by a parasite.

50
00:02:40,044 --> 00:02:43,274
The parasite survives within the host,

51
00:02:43,274 --> 00:02:48,814
gets to reproduce, infects other hosts.

52
00:02:50,652 --> 00:02:53,242
This is bad for a host, okay?

53
00:02:53,242 --> 00:02:57,732
So, the host fitness here
in this case will be reduced

54
00:02:57,732 --> 00:03:00,303
because of the parasite infection,

55
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:03,053
the host can get ill, 
or in the worst case can even die.

56
00:03:04,193 --> 00:03:07,263
Now, from the perspective 
of the parasite though, this is great.

57
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:10,343
So here, for-- 
Let me use red here.

58
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:15,013
The parasite fitness is up

59
00:03:15,013 --> 00:03:17,883
because the parasite 
has a great time surviving

60
00:03:17,883 --> 00:03:19,023
and reproducing.

61
00:03:19,512 --> 00:03:23,362
Now, assume there's a genetic
mutation in this host over here

62
00:03:23,362 --> 00:03:28,542
that prohibits the parasite
to infect this host.

63
00:03:28,542 --> 00:03:31,725
So, this host is now resistant.

64
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:37,817
That is bad news for the parasite, 
because the parasite cannot now infect,

65
00:03:37,817 --> 00:03:40,792
indeed it will perhaps get into the host,

66
00:03:40,792 --> 00:03:43,522
but there it will not be able
to reproduce,

67
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:45,202
or it might not even get in.

68
00:03:45,202 --> 00:03:48,222
So in this-- In any case, 
the fitness of the parasite

69
00:03:48,222 --> 00:03:50,482
will be severely reduced,

70
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:53,822
but for the host, 
because it avoided infection,

71
00:03:53,822 --> 00:03:56,822
the fitness will again 
be comparatively high.

72
00:03:57,421 --> 00:04:00,521
And so this is like 
the predator-prey system,

73
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:04,541
where the fitnesses of these two players
depend crucially on each other.

74
00:04:05,157 --> 00:04:07,317
So I'd like to formalize 
this host/parasite system

75
00:04:07,317 --> 00:04:08,347
a little bit more,

76
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:11,937
because ultimately we want
to implement it in Java Script.

77
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:14,034
So here's how we can think of this.

78
00:04:14,034 --> 00:04:18,144
We have a host, 
we have a parasite species.

79
00:04:19,687 --> 00:04:22,297
We're again going to assume
two alleles, A1 and A2,

80
00:04:22,297 --> 00:04:24,567
but to make things a little simpler here,

81
00:04:24,567 --> 00:04:28,787
we're actually going to assume now
that these species are haploid.

82
00:04:28,787 --> 00:04:34,360
Okay, so they only have one copy
of an allele or of a gene.

83
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:36,297
So in other words,

84
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:40,123
if there are two possible alleles,
A1 and A2,

85
00:04:40,123 --> 00:04:42,163
there are only two genotypes here.

86
00:04:42,163 --> 00:04:45,573
You're either A1 or you are A2.

87
00:04:45,573 --> 00:04:46,993
So same for the parasite.

88
00:04:46,993 --> 00:04:51,853
We're going to assume haploid parasites,
also with an A1 and an A2 alleles.

89
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:58,001
Now, these alleles need not be identical
but we just call them the same

90
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:04,199
because we found that the A1 parasite
can infect the A1 host,

91
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:08,199
and the A2 parasite 
can infect the A2 host,

92
00:05:08,199 --> 00:05:10,999
but the A1 cannot infect the A2 host,

93
00:05:10,999 --> 00:05:14,109
and the A2 parasite 
cannot infect the A1 host.

94
00:05:14,109 --> 00:05:17,259
So this is the so-called 
matching allele model,

95
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:21,599
where if the allele 
matches the host allele

96
00:05:21,599 --> 00:05:23,016
in any meaningful way,

97
00:05:23,016 --> 00:05:24,466
then the parasite can infect,

98
00:05:24,466 --> 00:05:27,286
and that's why we simply
labeled them the same.

99
00:05:28,224 --> 00:05:32,394
Now, such a system actually 
has an interesting dynamic

100
00:05:32,394 --> 00:05:34,229
if you think about it.

101
00:05:34,229 --> 00:05:35,771
Assume, for example,

102
00:05:35,771 --> 00:05:42,171
that the parasite A1 
at the moment is quite common.

103
00:05:42,171 --> 00:05:43,341
Okay?

104
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:47,061
So, consequently the A2 parasite is rare.

105
00:05:47,061 --> 00:05:48,600
What does that mean?

106
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,600
Well, it means this is bad news
for the A1 host, right?

107
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,650
Because there are lots of A1 parasites
that can infect the A1 host.

108
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:01,135
Conversely, for the A2 host, 
that's great news

109
00:06:01,135 --> 00:06:05,135
because the parasite 
that can infect the A2 host is rare.

110
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:07,821
So, as a consequence,

111
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:13,541
we would expect 
the A1 host frequency to go down,

112
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:18,601
because it's heavily parasitized 
and the A2 host frequency to go up.

113
00:06:19,326 --> 00:06:20,986
So, is that the end of the story?

114
00:06:21,383 --> 00:06:25,263
No, it's not, and that's exactly 
what makes co-evolution so fascinating.

115
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:30,679
Because it's not just that the host
depends on the parasite,

116
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:33,729
it's that the parasite 
depends also on the host.

117
00:06:34,163 --> 00:06:36,703
And what this means here, for example,

118
00:06:36,703 --> 00:06:40,283
if the A1 host frequency goes down,

119
00:06:40,283 --> 00:06:42,463
that's bad news for the A1 parasite,

120
00:06:42,463 --> 00:06:47,173
because the parasite A1
depends on the A1 host

121
00:06:47,173 --> 00:06:49,070
to survive and reproduce.

122
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,520
Consequently, it's good
for the A2 parasite

123
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,150
because there are now lots of A2 hosts.

124
00:06:54,150 --> 00:06:55,390
So in other words,

125
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:02,660
parasite A1 has a hard time, 
parasite A2 has a great time.

126
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:09,487
Now, with the exact same logic 
that brought us from here to here,

127
00:07:09,487 --> 00:07:13,097
we can now go over to another situation
where we can say, okay,

128
00:07:13,097 --> 00:07:16,337
while now that A1 is down, that's great,

129
00:07:16,337 --> 00:07:20,227
parasite A1, that's great for host A1,

130
00:07:21,457 --> 00:07:23,957
because it doesn't suffer 
the same parasite load

131
00:07:23,957 --> 00:07:25,797
as it just did before.

132
00:07:25,797 --> 00:07:28,686
And vice versa for the host A2.

133
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:33,507
The fact that parasite A2 
now becomes more frequent is bad news.

134
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:37,771
And then again, with the exact 
same logic, we would, in fact,

135
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:40,811
go from this situation to this situation,

136
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:45,271
where it's great for parasite A1
that there's now more A1 host

137
00:07:45,271 --> 00:07:49,427
and it's bad for the parasite A2
that there's now less A2.

138
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:53,954
And so, now you can see
the cyclical nature here of this system,

139
00:07:54,977 --> 00:07:57,697
and we will now implement this
in Java Script

140
00:07:57,697 --> 00:08:00,867
and you will see 
exactly this cyclical nature

141
00:08:00,867 --> 00:08:04,107
in the frequency of the genotypes.

142
00:08:04,107 --> 00:08:06,047
But before we do this,

143
00:08:06,047 --> 00:08:10,747
I want to mention one more concept 
that we're actually talking about here,

144
00:08:10,747 --> 00:08:15,117
and this is the concept 
of negative frequency-dependent selection,

145
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,479
negative frequency-dependent selection.

146
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:24,873
"Frequency-dependent."

147
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:29,785
Okay, so we know what selection is,
we've talked about this,

148
00:08:31,034 --> 00:08:33,754
but what does frequency-dependent
selection mean?

149
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:37,004
And in particular, what does negative 
frequency-dependent selection mean?

150
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:38,394
Well, frequency-dependent

151
00:08:38,394 --> 00:08:40,734
simply means that the fitness 
of the genotypes

152
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:43,424
depends on their frequencies.

153
00:08:43,424 --> 00:08:46,424
That it's not a fixed value, 
it can change over time

154
00:08:46,424 --> 00:08:48,424
and it depends on the frequencies.

155
00:08:48,424 --> 00:08:51,194
Negative simply means 
that this correlation is negative.

156
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:55,334
So, genotypes are less fit 
when they're more common

157
00:08:55,334 --> 00:08:58,284
and they're more fit 
when they're less common.

158
00:08:58,284 --> 00:09:00,754
And it's this negative 
frequency-dependence

159
00:09:00,754 --> 00:09:04,504
that so often leads 
to this cyclical dynamics.

160
00:09:04,504 --> 00:09:07,074
So, with that established,

161
00:09:07,074 --> 00:09:11,264
let's go ahead and implement
such a system in Java Script.
