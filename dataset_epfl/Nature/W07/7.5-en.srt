1
00:00:03,332 --> 00:00:04,094
Welcome back.

2
00:00:04,333 --> 00:00:07,258
Nature, In Code
We’re in chapter seven, lecture five

3
00:00:07,473 --> 00:00:09,000
and we just started an epidemic.

4
00:00:09,202 --> 00:00:11,839
And you can tell that
I’m extremely excited about this.

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:14,362
Now in the real world,
I wouldn’t be excited at all.

6
00:00:14,568 --> 00:00:17,005
But here in the computer,
in our simulation

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,307
That's quite alright.
It is very exciting.

8
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:20,509
But we've seen that

9
00:00:20,723 --> 00:00:22,529
there's one crucial step missing

10
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,159
and that is that of recovery.

11
00:00:24,372 --> 00:00:26,621
This is what we're going
to implement right now.

12
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,516
So, here we're back in our code.

13
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:31,291
This seems to work all well.

14
00:00:31,509 --> 00:00:33,794
So we have all these functions here.

15
00:00:34,009 --> 00:00:35,809
And here is the core of it.

16
00:00:36,024 --> 00:00:37,475
The "run time step" function

17
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:39,581
that sets up the "temp grid"

18
00:00:39,788 --> 00:00:42,327
and then exposes the neighbours
if they're infected

19
00:00:42,523 --> 00:00:45,061
and, finally, moves
the statuses over

20
00:00:45,267 --> 00:00:47,117
from the "temp grid"
into the "grid".

21
00:00:47,446 --> 00:00:51,758
So, we do have
the exposure function here.

22
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:53,764
But what we don’t have is

23
00:00:53,990 --> 00:00:58,666
If there's an infected individual

24
00:00:58,904 --> 00:01:01,217
we may expose the neighbours.

25
00:01:01,415 --> 00:01:05,840
But there's also the chance
that an individual recovers.

26
00:01:06,071 --> 00:01:07,821
What’s missing here really

27
00:01:08,046 --> 00:01:10,071
is that we need to
give these individuals

28
00:01:10,281 --> 00:01:12,057
a chance to recover.

29
00:01:12,278 --> 00:01:14,490
So, I’m simply going to now
call a function here

30
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:16,127
"try recovery"

31
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:17,579
as well, so "try recovery".

32
00:01:17,792 --> 00:01:19,792
Again, we need to
pass in the co-ordinates,

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,250
so that this function will know

34
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:25,785
which individual tries to recover.

35
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:29,674
And then I’m going to
implement this function

36
00:01:29,888 --> 00:01:30,813
 “try recovery"

37
00:01:31,006 --> 00:01:32,735
I’m going to do this down here.

38
00:01:32,949 --> 00:01:34,437
It doesn’t matter where we do it.

39
00:01:34,642 --> 00:01:37,292
But I already have the
"try infection" function here

40
00:01:37,507 --> 00:01:42,657
So, I’m going to implement
the “try recovery” function as well.

41
00:01:42,912 --> 00:01:45,619
Now we don’t need to go through
all the neighbours

42
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:48,252
because recovery is now

43
00:01:48,465 --> 00:01:51,952
something that really affects
only one individual.

44
00:01:52,196 --> 00:01:55,508
So, we can basically
use this exact same logic here

45
00:01:55,734 --> 00:01:58,972
We can say,
ok, if the individual

46
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:03,863
is indeed infected at the moment.

47
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:07,531
So, here we’re
not testing for susceptibility

48
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:11,582
we’re actually
testing for infectiousness.

49
00:02:11,873 --> 00:02:15,636
So if this individual is infected

50
00:02:16,186 --> 00:02:20,592
then with a certain probability
it will recover.

51
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:24,156
So, if “Math random”

52
00:02:24,973 --> 00:02:27,548
is now smaller than “gamma”

53
00:02:27,749 --> 00:02:30,837
OK? not "beta",
"gamma" is the recovery probability.

54
00:02:31,078 --> 00:02:35,979
Then set the corresponding
"temp grid" individual 

55
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:41,193
So "temp grid, i, ii" to "R".

56
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,368
So, this is virtually
the same function.

57
00:02:45,572 --> 00:02:46,931
It's just named differently.

58
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:48,853
And here it just
checks for status "S",

59
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:50,366
here it checks
for status "I",

60
00:02:50,574 --> 00:02:51,628
the condition here.

61
00:02:51,834 --> 00:02:53,841
The probability of
something happening,

62
00:02:54,048 --> 00:02:54,635
is "beta" here,

63
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:55,556
It's "gamma" here .

64
00:02:55,755 --> 00:02:56,702
And what happens is

65
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:59,498
this individual moves
from susceptible to infected.

66
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:03,290
Whereas this individual
moves from infected to recovered.

67
00:03:03,511 --> 00:03:05,509
And that's pretty much it.

68
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,449
So, by the way

69
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:08,083
I don't know if you noticed but

70
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:09,187
in principle we're

71
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:10,437
doing a double-check

72
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,662
right, we are testing here

73
00:03:12,871 --> 00:03:15,578
that the individual is
infected in the first place.

74
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,618
Otherwise, there can be no recovery.

75
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:21,646
But, in fact we're already
testing this up here.

76
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,585
And that's fine.

77
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:25,730
I mean, in principle
it is a double-check.

78
00:03:25,946 --> 00:03:29,521
And one of them is,
in principle, unnecessary.

79
00:03:29,733 --> 00:03:33,833
But, I certainly would like
to keep them here in any case.

80
00:03:34,192 --> 00:03:36,967
But, certainly, also, here
it seems like it's a good place

81
00:03:37,178 --> 00:03:38,443
just to double-check,

82
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,529
and to make this method
stand alone. 

83
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:43,867
Because this method cannot
be 100% certain that

84
00:03:44,084 --> 00:03:46,796
whoever calls this method
has already checked

85
00:03:47,005 --> 00:03:50,155
whether the corresponding
individual is indeed infected.

86
00:03:50,362 --> 00:03:52,725
So, this is an extra step

87
00:03:52,947 --> 00:03:54,890
that, in principle,
would be unnecessary,

88
00:03:55,097 --> 00:03:58,060
but I still think it's good practice
here in this case.

89
00:03:58,265 --> 00:03:59,633
So with that out of the way.

90
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:03,242
Let's save this and
let's go over to browser.

91
00:04:03,566 --> 00:04:08,237
Where we have our poor
fully infected population,

92
00:04:08,445 --> 00:04:09,889
and let's reload this.

93
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:13,573
So, now what you see here
is a real infection.

94
00:04:13,773 --> 00:04:15,324
So, these individuals in red

95
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:17,393
are obviously infected

96
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:20,620
and they will expose
the grey individuals nearby and

97
00:04:20,832 --> 00:04:23,594
because of that,
the epidemic keeps spreading

98
00:04:23,814 --> 00:04:27,089
but everyone in the back
eventually recovers.

99
00:04:27,305 --> 00:04:31,140
And now this process
will at some point stop

100
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:35,003
because essentially we are
running out of susceptibles.

101
00:04:35,219 --> 00:04:36,131
Now, it's happened.

102
00:04:36,347 --> 00:04:37,763
Let me reload this again.

103
00:04:38,556 --> 00:04:41,942
So here it's starting
and it's slowly spreading out,

104
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:45,266
and it does so at the edges,

105
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:48,519
because that's where
the susceptibles are.

106
00:04:48,756 --> 00:04:52,168
It can't, obviously, the green
individuals here have recovered,

107
00:04:52,393 --> 00:04:54,415
they cannot be infected any more.

108
00:04:54,632 --> 00:04:56,832
And here, again, eventually

109
00:04:57,106 --> 00:05:01,318
the infection will
run out of susceptibles.

110
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:03,568
So, that's a key observation here.

111
00:05:03,782 --> 00:05:07,616
Another observation that you
I'm sure have noticed,

112
00:05:07,841 --> 00:05:10,197
is that we have these small islands

113
00:05:10,418 --> 00:05:13,080
these small clusters of grey

114
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:15,670
meaning susceptible individuals.

115
00:05:15,867 --> 00:05:17,304
Why is that the case?

116
00:05:17,516 --> 00:05:21,615
Well, essentially these individuals
probably just lucked out.

117
00:05:22,138 --> 00:05:27,213
I mean, I'm sure some of them here,
well, it's guaranteed in fact

118
00:05:27,433 --> 00:05:31,045
that each inidvidual here
that has green neighbours

119
00:05:31,257 --> 00:05:35,038
has at somepoint
been surrounded by red neighbours

120
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:38,313
because the green individuals,
all of them, were red before.

121
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:40,953
It just so happened
that they recovered

122
00:05:41,156 --> 00:05:46,118
before they had a chance to infect
the susceptible individuals.

123
00:05:46,334 --> 00:05:48,809
So all of these individuals
just got lucky.

124
00:05:49,026 --> 00:05:51,445
There are some here in
these larger clusters

125
00:05:51,674 --> 00:05:53,596
that got very lucky
in the sense that,

126
00:05:53,804 --> 00:05:56,906
there, all their neighbours
got lucky in the first place

127
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,775
by not being infected
even though they were exposed.

128
00:05:59,988 --> 00:06:03,514
And so there are few individuals
that indeed were never ever exposed

129
00:06:03,716 --> 00:06:04,891
but that's very very rare.

130
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:08,177
Most of them were exposed
but just by chance

131
00:06:08,395 --> 00:06:09,745
they didn't get infected.

132
00:06:10,147 --> 00:06:14,761
Now, another observation is in fact
that this recovery may die out.

133
00:06:15,585 --> 00:06:20,428
It could be that these
infected individuals all recover

134
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,529
before they have a chance
to infect new individuals.

135
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:26,095
This is not happening here.

136
00:06:26,305 --> 00:06:27,955
Let's see, maybe
it's happening here

137
00:06:28,163 --> 00:06:29,264
No, it's not happening.

138
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:32,077
Well, maybe we should just
go back to the code and

139
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:37,581
increase our probability
of recovery a little bit.

140
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:39,496
So let's go back to our code.

141
00:06:39,712 --> 00:06:42,712
And go up here
where we have the global variables.

142
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:46,328
And here we have "gamma".
That's the probability of recovery.

143
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:49,190
Let's set this to "0.15"

144
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:50,584
instead of just "0.1".

145
00:06:50,794 --> 00:06:55,729
So now there's much faster
recovery and it may be that

146
00:06:55,966 --> 00:06:59,075
now the infection
will die out earlier. Let's see.

147
00:06:59,288 --> 00:07:00,700
So, yep, here it just happened.

148
00:07:00,898 --> 00:07:04,429
You saw this.
You saw a few dots here in red,

149
00:07:04,655 --> 00:07:07,953
but then they recovered too fast

150
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:11,875
before new individuals
could be infected, and, of course, 

151
00:07:12,086 --> 00:07:16,430
once the last
infected individual recovers

152
00:07:16,645 --> 00:07:17,919
there's no more infection.

153
00:07:18,128 --> 00:07:19,853
Let me just reload this.

154
00:07:20,458 --> 00:07:22,821
Here, no, it almost died out.

155
00:07:23,032 --> 00:07:25,532
Let's see, it looks like 
this could keep going

156
00:07:25,756 --> 00:07:27,067
for quite a while.

157
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,459
Now it's a bit harder
because it's now on two fronts.

158
00:07:32,672 --> 00:07:35,171
One here, one here,
one down here.

159
00:07:35,391 --> 00:07:37,328
And this probably just keeps going.

160
00:07:37,545 --> 00:07:41,107
But you can already see there are
potentially very large clusters

161
00:07:41,322 --> 00:07:42,567
now here of susceptibles,

162
00:07:42,764 --> 00:07:46,285
because it locally died out before
it could start an infection here.

163
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:48,037
Now let's see where this is going.

164
00:07:48,245 --> 00:07:49,594
This is an
interesting case.

165
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:50,890
So this one died out.

166
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:52,625
It looks like it's dying out here.

167
00:07:52,828 --> 00:07:55,253
So you can see here
the consequence of this now

168
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:58,745
is that the outbreak size
for the number of individuals

169
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:01,506
that got infected in total
is now smaller

170
00:08:01,722 --> 00:08:04,807
It's probably, I don't know,
I'd say around a third here

171
00:08:05,004 --> 00:08:06,379
of the total population.

172
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:08,443
Let's do this one more time.

173
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:11,578
One more time where
it doesn't die out.

174
00:08:11,789 --> 00:08:15,739
So, here we have a cluster
it's growing on three fronts.

175
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:18,203
And now it's only
growing on two it seems.

176
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:20,335
One here to the left,
one to the right.

177
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:23,185
The one here died out.
The one here died out as well.

178
00:08:23,389 --> 00:08:28,389
So, now you can see this
is a farly "small" outbreak

179
00:08:28,637 --> 00:08:32,449
that basically stopped itself
so to speak.

180
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:35,529
So this is the consequences
of a really fine balance

181
00:08:35,725 --> 00:08:38,250
between this probability
of infection

182
00:08:38,474 --> 00:08:40,319
and the probability
of recovery.

183
00:08:40,528 --> 00:08:44,366
And if the recovery rate is very low
compared to the infection rate

184
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:46,751
then pretty much everyone
will get infected.

185
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,431
But if it's relatively high
compared to the infection rate,

186
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:56,849
then there's probability these
outbreaks will stop on their own

187
00:08:57,064 --> 00:09:01,307
because the infected individuals
will eventually recover

188
00:09:01,525 --> 00:09:04,067
before they get a chance
to infect new individuals

189
00:09:04,276 --> 00:09:07,296
and this is exactly what
happens here.

190
00:09:07,936 --> 00:09:12,436
So, it's a constant race between
recovery and infection.

191
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:19,560
So, this concludes our simulations
of this standard situation.

192
00:09:19,775 --> 00:09:21,825
What I want to do though
is I want to take

193
00:09:22,036 --> 00:09:24,186
one more shot at this

194
00:09:24,385 --> 00:09:27,085
and modify something
which can have

195
00:09:27,298 --> 00:09:29,960
which is a small modification
but it can actually have

196
00:09:30,155 --> 00:09:31,155
huge consequences.

197
00:09:31,365 --> 00:09:36,365
That modification is that we're
going to modify the contact network.

198
00:09:36,584 --> 00:09:37,584
So, at the moment

199
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:42,785
we asssume that each individual has
exactly eight contacts or neighbours

200
00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:46,115
The slight modification that
we're going to make now is

201
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:50,523
occasionally, very rarely, a contact
is being made between

202
00:09:50,735 --> 00:09:54,310
two individuals that are
potentially very far away.

203
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,027
So, "long distance" contact.

204
00:09:56,236 --> 00:10:00,348
And you can think of this as
someone gets on a plane,

205
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,467
travels to some other place

206
00:10:02,973 --> 00:10:04,911
and then has contacts there.

207
00:10:06,048 --> 00:10:09,048
This is, now, something
we can implement very easily

208
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:11,010
with the code we have in place

209
00:10:11,223 --> 00:10:13,136
and as we'll see in the next lecture

210
00:10:13,342 --> 00:10:15,967
this will have rather
dramatic consequences.

211
00:10:16,174 --> 00:10:17,961
So, I'll see you
in the next lecture.
