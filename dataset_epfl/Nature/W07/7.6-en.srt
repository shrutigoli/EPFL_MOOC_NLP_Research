1
00:00:03,461 --> 00:00:06,575
Welcome back! Nature, In code.
Chapter 7, lecture 6.

2
00:00:07,107 --> 00:00:10,641
In this lecture, we are gonna
slightly modify our contact

3
00:00:10,824 --> 00:00:13,937
network structure. At the moment,
it only allows for disease

4
00:00:14,112 --> 00:00:16,415
transmissions between
very local neighbors.

5
00:00:16,777 --> 00:00:19,752
We are now gonna relax this
assumption, just a little bit

6
00:00:19,952 --> 00:00:24,305
to allow for occasional long
distance transmission of disease.

7
00:00:24,425 --> 00:00:26,505
and even though, this is
just a minor change

8
00:00:26,655 --> 00:00:29,166
we will see that
the effects are quite large.

9
00:00:29,657 --> 00:00:33,228
Ok, so here we are
in our expose_neighbors function

10
00:00:33,428 --> 00:00:37,541
where we try to infect our neighbors
except of course ourselves.

11
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,654
Now, what we are going
to say here is

12
00:00:41,177 --> 00:00:44,050
in one percent of the cases,
we wanna do something special.

13
00:00:44,528 --> 00:00:46,953
So, the way we are gonna do this
is, we are gonna write

14
00:00:47,178 --> 00:00:49,044
if math_random

15
00:00:50,705 --> 00:00:52,167
is smaller than 0.01

16
00:00:52,660 --> 00:00:55,106
So, in one percent of the cases,
we will do something

17
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:57,088
and this we have to implement

18
00:00:57,786 --> 00:01:00,438
else, so in ninety-nine
percent of the cases

19
00:01:01,202 --> 00:01:05,547
we are just gonna go here with
the old version of try_infection

20
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:08,594
to get bounded indices
of the neighbors.

21
00:01:09,788 --> 00:01:12,618
Alright, so what do we want to do
in one percent of the cases?

22
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:15,364
Well, in one percent of the cases,
we simply want to pick

23
00:01:15,526 --> 00:01:19,031
a random individual that can be
anywhere on the grid, independent

24
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:21,316
of where we currently are.

25
00:01:21,479 --> 00:01:25,655
and so, we can do this by basically
picking two random numbers.

26
00:01:25,855 --> 00:01:28,110
So, I am gonna say here var random_i

27
00:01:28,948 --> 00:01:32,516
and, I already thankfully
have a method

28
00:01:32,716 --> 00:01:34,587
a function that allows me to do this

29
00:01:34,787 --> 00:01:37,787
and this is of course,
the get_random_int

30
00:01:37,987 --> 00:01:39,497
which has a min and a max.

31
00:01:40,367 --> 00:01:46,325
So, zero is the min
and the max is grid_length - 1.

32
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,465
and I am gonna do the same,
for second random variable.

33
00:01:52,183 --> 00:01:54,327
So, random ii in this case

34
00:01:54,527 --> 00:01:57,723
but it calls the same function
with the same min, max range.

35
00:01:54,808 --> 00:01:57,945


36
00:01:59,049 --> 00:02:02,749
Tthen, I can basically say alright,
now try to infect this individual

37
00:02:02,949 --> 00:02:06,285
instead of my neighbour.
So, try_infection

38
00:02:06,973 --> 00:02:10,440
and now, the indices
here are random_i

39
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:13,467
and random_ii.

40
00:02:13,897 --> 00:02:16,513
We don't have to worry
about bounded indices

41
00:02:16,713 --> 00:02:21,383
because, these two random variables,
are already chosen in such a way

42
00:02:21,633 --> 00:02:24,487
that they are in the correct range.

43
00:02:24,839 --> 00:02:27,631
And there is one tiny detail,
that I want to mention

44
00:02:27,831 --> 00:02:32,865
we do not currently check
for random_i and random_ii

45
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:35,422
being identical to i and ii.

46
00:02:35,622 --> 00:02:39,426
that could mean, that
we could pick a random individual

47
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,753
that is actually ourselves.

48
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:45,145
and so, this code now does in fact

49
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:49,601
Well, this code to be more precise
does, in fact allow for

50
00:02:49,813 --> 00:02:53,560
self-infection, but it is a very
rare, event, and so, I don't want

51
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,268
to lose focus here

52
00:02:56,462 --> 00:02:59,337
on the issue of
long term transmissions

53
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:03,857
you should have the knowledge now,
to basically check for the case

54
00:03:04,057 --> 00:03:07,057
where random_i will be equal to i

55
00:03:07,257 --> 00:03:10,003
and random_ii be equal to  ii.

56
00:03:10,203 --> 00:03:13,678
and then, we could basically do this
until this is not the case.

57
00:03:14,216 --> 00:03:16,876
But I am gonna, essentially
leave this up to you now.

58
00:03:17,038 --> 00:03:19,948
It won't change much here but I just
wanted to mention it, that 

59
00:03:20,124 --> 00:03:23,124
it is now theoretically
possible to do self infection.

60
00:03:23,324 --> 00:03:25,903
But it is so rare, I'm gonna
ignore it for the time being

61
00:03:26,366 --> 00:03:28,186
and this is the entire change now.

62
00:03:28,616 --> 00:03:30,509
Ok, so we are just
gonna save this file

63
00:03:30,672 --> 00:03:34,164
we're gonna go over to the browser
and we're gonna reload here

64
00:03:34,346 --> 00:03:38,909
the document. And here what happens
is, we have an outbreak of one.

65
00:03:39,109 --> 00:03:43,524
Basically, patient zero recovered,
before it had the chance to

66
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,273
infect others. So, obviously we
won't see much here

67
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,934
let's reload this again. So now,
here it's happening

68
00:03:49,122 --> 00:03:53,133
we have a cluster, and look,
here was another cluster and another

69
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:57,093
So suddenly these small clusters
pop up seemingly out of nowhere.

70
00:03:57,293 --> 00:04:00,524
These are now seeded, by these
long-term transmission events

71
00:04:00,682 --> 00:04:03,052
and now, you know at this stage,
you can already see

72
00:04:03,215 --> 00:04:05,578
this is gonna be
a fairly large outbreak.

73
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:07,223
and indeed it is.

74
00:04:07,423 --> 00:04:10,145
I don't know, how many individuals
are infected here?

75
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:13,532
and ultimately recovered, but I
would say somewhere around

76
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:17,410
sixty percent. Let's reload this,
again here is the first cluster

77
00:04:17,610 --> 00:04:20,442
and now the second appeared here
and now here, here, here.

78
00:04:20,642 --> 00:04:23,782
At this point, the epidemic
can essentially not be stopped.

79
00:04:23,982 --> 00:04:27,702
This is now very easy for the
simulation here, to start

80
00:04:27,852 --> 00:04:32,932
new clusters and once that
happens, it is very hard to control.

81
00:04:33,494 --> 00:04:37,691
So again, here we can just
let this run, until it finishes.

82
00:04:38,361 --> 00:04:40,531
Let's see, yup now it's finished

83
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:42,394
Ok, let's reload this once more

84
00:04:43,641 --> 00:04:46,516
here, and now the first two
clusters, but they died out.

85
00:04:46,716 --> 00:04:49,716
Will this die out? Will it?

86
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:53,584
No, it started a new cluster here,
and now here, and now here

87
00:04:53,784 --> 00:04:56,838
and now, we have multiple clusters
and I think now it is over.

88
00:04:57,011 --> 00:05:00,011
The thing will just go
all the way to the finish

89
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:02,126
and infect almost everyone here.

90
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:06,166
So, you can see these are now
changed dynamics.

91
00:05:07,059 --> 00:05:10,549
Before, with the values we currently
have for beta and gamma

92
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:13,360
it was very hard
to get a large outbreak.

93
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,272
Basically, the clusters will just
grow, grow , grow locally

94
00:05:16,435 --> 00:05:18,335
but it would eventually die out

95
00:05:18,535 --> 00:05:22,269
especially, as we increase 
the recovery range.

96
00:05:22,712 --> 00:05:27,761
But in this new world, with these
occasional long distant jumps

97
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:31,974
it's very easy to seed
many, many new spots

98
00:05:32,174 --> 00:05:34,307
new clusters, and once that happens

99
00:05:34,971 --> 00:05:37,217
the infection basically
cannot be stopped.

100
00:05:37,662 --> 00:05:43,055
So, my hunch here is that, this new
network structure has a major effect

101
00:05:43,956 --> 00:05:47,676
that's something we can observe
here, in the sense that

102
00:05:47,876 --> 00:05:50,527
outbreaks occur much faster now, and

103
00:05:51,195 --> 00:05:54,912
crucially they are also much larger.
Now, this is the contention

104
00:05:55,112 --> 00:06:00,802
that we can put to the test. We can
calculate the average outbreak size

105
00:06:01,002 --> 00:06:04,452
here quite easily, and compare
the two different scenarios

106
00:06:04,652 --> 00:06:08,152
with and without long
distance transmission.

107
00:06:08,641 --> 00:06:11,340
But before we do that,
I want to just show you

108
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:15,522
in another type of a network
structure, how this works

109
00:06:15,722 --> 00:06:17,154
and why this is the case?

110
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:19,981
So, here I am plotting
a similar network structure

111
00:06:20,144 --> 00:06:23,144
that we originally had in the
completely local neighborhood.

112
00:06:23,307 --> 00:06:26,195
The only change here is that
it's not two dimensional

113
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:31,836
it is simply a circle, and I am
connecting each node to

114
00:06:31,999 --> 00:06:36,448
two neighbors, two
immediate neighbors on both sides.

115
00:06:36,648 --> 00:06:40,343
Each node here has four neighbors,
and this node has four neighbors

116
00:06:40,493 --> 00:06:43,550
to the left, to the right. This node
has four neighbors to the left

117
00:06:43,713 --> 00:06:48,805
to the right, and so on. This is
a very local network structure.

118
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,575
and if we now pick
two random individuals 

119
00:06:51,775 --> 00:06:54,483
for example, this individual
and this individual here

120
00:06:55,421 --> 00:06:58,635
then we can see, well, to go from
this individual to this individual

121
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,449
we actually need to go
through a lot of nodes.

122
00:07:02,649 --> 00:07:06,572
Concretely this here is the shortest
path between these two nodes

123
00:07:06,772 --> 00:07:09,187
and you can see that here
we have one, two, three, four

124
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:12,399
five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten,
eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen

125
00:07:12,561 --> 00:07:15,211
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,
eighteen, nineteen, twenty

126
00:07:15,376 --> 00:07:19,813
twenty one, twenty two intermediary
nodes. So, what do you think of

127
00:07:19,963 --> 00:07:23,013
right now? Information transmission
or disease transmission

128
00:07:23,176 --> 00:07:26,388
and you can see, you need to
go through a lot of hops.

129
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:30,326
and so, in each of these hops has
a probability of passing on

130
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:33,888
an infection, since, it is very to
see that this could very easily

131
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,668
 fade out stochastically.

132
00:07:36,839 --> 00:07:40,250
Now, if we can take this network
go back to these two nodes.

133
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:44,544
and we now pick a few of these
connections and we just randomly

134
00:07:44,719 --> 00:07:47,968
rewire them, but really,
only few a like this.

135
00:07:49,418 --> 00:07:53,218
Now here is a new network structure.
From a macro perspective

136
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:56,418
this is practically the same
network structure

137
00:07:56,618 --> 00:08:01,306
we, only changed one, two three,
four, five edges here.

138
00:08:01,506 --> 00:08:04,968
of all these many, many edges.
But I think it is now very easy

139
00:08:05,168 --> 00:08:08,855
to see that the shortest path
between any two nodes

140
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:11,805
is much shorter, so, here now,
we only need to go through five

141
00:08:11,968 --> 00:08:15,280
intermediary nodes, and that
makes any transmission

142
00:08:15,457 --> 00:08:17,370
stochastic transmission events

143
00:08:17,543 --> 00:08:20,304
between these two nodes,
much, much more likely.

144
00:08:21,048 --> 00:08:25,061
and this is a very well known, and
well understood phenomenon by now.

145
00:08:25,395 --> 00:08:28,867
It's called the small world effect,
and it's also why we think

146
00:08:29,067 --> 00:08:33,702
in social networks, each node
actually, has a relatively short

147
00:08:34,727 --> 00:08:38,089
distance to every other node
in the network

148
00:08:38,401 --> 00:08:43,051
and if you do this in a global
scale, there is this old saying that

149
00:08:43,251 --> 00:08:47,419
everyone knows everyone else, in the
planet through six degrees

150
00:08:47,569 --> 00:08:50,095
of separation. Now,
there is still a little bit of fear

151
00:08:50,257 --> 00:08:52,895
a scientific dispute to
whether that's true or not.

152
00:08:53,095 --> 00:08:56,244
But, we now know that indeed,
most social networks are

153
00:08:56,423 --> 00:08:57,736
structured like this

154
00:08:57,915 --> 00:09:02,390
and so, it is clear that the average
path between any two nodes

155
00:09:02,903 --> 00:09:07,565
is much, much, much shorter, than it
would be if it wouldn't have these

156
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:10,765
long distance somewhat
random connections in here.

157
00:09:11,269 --> 00:09:14,831
So, this the small world phenomenon,
and this explains why

158
00:09:14,994 --> 00:09:16,532
I think at least

159
00:09:16,706 --> 00:09:18,644
from looking at
the simulation results

160
00:09:18,807 --> 00:09:20,757
that the outbreaks
are much more likely

161
00:09:20,957 --> 00:09:23,821
and when they do occur, they are
indeed much bigger.

162
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:27,493
But, no need to believe in it,
we can test this

163
00:09:27,731 --> 00:09:30,743
because we have the code in place,
and this is what we're gonna do

164
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:34,090
in the next lecture.
So, I will see you there.
