00:00:03,999 --> 00:00:06,711
Welcome back! Nature, In Code.
Chapter 7, Lecture 1.

2
00:00:06,955 --> 00:00:08,205
This is the first lecture

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,392
and this chapter is all about
infectious diseases

4
00:00:11,624 --> 00:00:13,224
and the epidemics they cause.

5
00:00:13,424 --> 00:00:15,161
If you look back in human history

6
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:18,111
you can see many infectious
diseases spreading through

7
00:00:18,273 --> 00:00:19,498
the human populations.

8
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:22,174
Sometimes, causing great misery

9
00:00:22,374 --> 00:00:24,719
and large fractions of
the population dying.

10
00:00:25,049 --> 00:00:27,661
Most famously,
perhaps the black plague

11
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:30,606
that spread through Europe,
and the rest of the world

12
00:00:30,806 --> 00:00:31,887
a few centuries ago.

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,299
But one need to only turn on the TV
or any News

14
00:00:36,499 --> 00:00:40,486
to see that, infectious diseases 
are still a major threat.

15
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:42,527
Just recently was Ebola.

16
00:00:43,176 --> 00:00:45,789
At the moment, Zika virus
is getting all the headlines.

17
00:00:45,948 --> 00:00:48,440
Next year, it will probably be
something different.

18
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:51,961
At the same time, these are only,
quote unquote the infectious

19
00:00:52,224 --> 00:00:55,974
diseases that cause the headlines
or take the headlines. But there

20
00:00:56,174 --> 00:01:00,049
are in fact, hundreds or indeed
thousands of infectious diseases

21
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:02,911
currently spreading
through the human population.

22
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:06,186
There are thousands, that are
constantly being  imported

23
00:01:06,386 --> 00:01:09,786
from animal reservoirs.
So, it is a major threat.

24
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:13,049
But in this chapter,
we are not necessarily

25
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:15,792
concerned with the threat
per say, but rather

26
00:01:15,967 --> 00:01:18,675
just trying to understand,
how the diseases spread, what

27
00:01:18,836 --> 00:01:22,024
kind of epidemics do they cause?
and what does it all depend on?

28
00:01:22,224 --> 00:01:26,856
and we are going to reason about
this, of course, using Java Script.

29
00:01:27,324 --> 00:01:30,799
For an epidemic to occur, we need
a couple of things that are in

30
00:01:30,999 --> 00:01:34,161
place. First of all, we need
a susceptible population

31
00:01:35,224 --> 00:01:39,086
and then, we need an infectious
agent that can infect hosts,

32
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:42,486
and critically, can pass itself on

33
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:45,357
to other susceptible hosts.

34
00:01:45,749 --> 00:01:48,586
Then this host gets infected
and so on..

35
00:01:49,698 --> 00:01:51,811
So, this is important
for a couple of reasons

36
00:01:51,974 --> 00:01:54,974
if an infectious agent
gets into one host

37
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:57,674
but it cannot transmit
itself to next host

38
00:01:57,874 --> 00:01:59,767
well, too bad for
this host, ofcourse

39
00:01:59,967 --> 00:02:02,967
but there is now, no danger of
large scale epidemics.

40
00:02:03,774 --> 00:02:07,711
So, this transmission
is a condition for an epidemic.

41
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:10,911
Of course, that is the infectious
part of infectious diseases.

42
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,174
The second part of infectious
diseases is, diseases.

43
00:02:14,761 --> 00:02:20,561
In fact, many infectious agents
do not cause illness in their hosts

44
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:25,199
and this may be surprising to learn.
But, it is indeed is quite true

45
00:02:25,399 --> 00:02:28,399
and only a few cause illnesses

46
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:30,886
and these are of course,
the ones we worry about.

47
00:02:31,036 --> 00:02:32,100
Because they now have

48
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:35,675
the potential especially in
combination with the infectious part

49
00:02:35,886 --> 00:02:38,574
to cause this large scale epidemics

50
00:02:38,786 --> 00:02:42,199
that can really cause,
a lot of mortality and casualities

51
00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:44,524
and there are, of course
many in the world

52
00:02:44,724 --> 00:02:46,761
that we know of in
the human population.

53
00:02:47,048 --> 00:02:52,449
Cold, flu, HIV, AIDS, Sars, measles,
Ebola, whooping cough, zika virus

54
00:02:52,649 --> 00:02:55,649
and you name it. The list
is essentially endless

55
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:56,978
and we can model this

56
00:02:57,409 --> 00:03:01,332
with a relatively straight forward
framework, that is called the SIR

57
00:03:01,534 --> 00:03:04,596
 framework and this S
stands for susceptible

58
00:03:06,737 --> 00:03:09,425
infected, and infectious

59
00:03:09,637 --> 00:03:12,000
and recovered, or removed. 

60
00:03:12,148 --> 00:03:14,736
So what does that mean, so these
are first letters here

61
00:03:14,886 --> 00:03:16,723
SIR, it simply means that

62
00:03:17,699 --> 00:03:20,736
in the beginning, individuals
are assumed to be in this class

63
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:23,574
they are now susceptible
to an infectious disease

64
00:03:23,774 --> 00:03:26,886
when exposed to an infectious agent,
with a certain probability

65
00:03:27,086 --> 00:03:30,261
they do get infected, 
so they move into this class here

66
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:32,410
and now they are
infectious themselves

67
00:03:33,011 --> 00:03:35,735
and they can now infect
other susceptible individuals

68
00:03:35,899 --> 00:03:39,799
and with a certain probability,
they will move into this class

69
00:03:40,086 --> 00:03:42,871
so they clear the infection,and they
are now immune

70
00:03:43,071 --> 00:03:45,730
and they cannot be infected anymore.

71
00:03:46,048 --> 00:03:48,226
There are different
variance of this model.

72
00:03:48,389 --> 00:03:50,785
For example, you can ignore
the recovered class

73
00:03:51,061 --> 00:03:53,799
when say, ok there is no
permanent immune memory

74
00:03:54,425 --> 00:03:58,311
individuals who clear the infection
will nevertheless, straight go back

75
00:03:58,511 --> 00:04:00,030
into the susceptible class.

76
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,364
You can add intermediary classes

77
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:03,403
and so on..

78
00:04:03,586 --> 00:04:07,046
This really depends on the complete
biology of the infectious disease

79
00:04:07,224 --> 00:04:08,573
that you are trying to model

80
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:12,370
and modelling is an enormously
important aspect

81
00:04:12,607 --> 00:04:14,218
of this whole thing here, because

82
00:04:14,761 --> 00:04:17,947
these are of course, questions of
great public health importance

83
00:04:18,098 --> 00:04:20,585
nevertheless, we can of course,
for obvious reasons

84
00:04:20,797 --> 00:04:24,674
not do large-scale human
experiments, thankfully so.

85
00:04:25,323 --> 00:04:27,874
But we can model things in computers

86
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:31,249
and this is indeed,
what we do on a daily basis

87
00:04:31,449 --> 00:04:34,449
and many people do this,
many research groups do this

88
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:38,424
many public health agencies do this,
they are trying to simulate

89
00:04:38,624 --> 00:04:41,115
large disease outbreaks
in the computer

90
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:44,311
and with computational tools,
they try to understand

91
00:04:44,648 --> 00:04:48,136
what happens if you do this? if you
do that? which is the best strategy?

92
00:04:48,336 --> 00:04:51,511
to deal with a particular pathogen.
So, what we are learning here is

93
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:54,272
not only interesting,
from a biological perspective

94
00:04:54,442 --> 00:04:55,529
but is also

95
00:04:55,785 --> 00:05:00,186
highly relevant for day to day
public health considerations.

96
00:05:00,661 --> 00:05:02,923
Now, the way we model
this concretely is that

97
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:05,061
we say, ok, there are individuals

98
00:05:05,526 --> 00:05:08,913
they are, as we said susceptible,
and then when they get exposed

99
00:05:09,501 --> 00:05:12,413
to infected,
and infectious individuals

100
00:05:13,055 --> 00:05:13,993
then

101
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,327
they can get infected themselves

102
00:05:17,655 --> 00:05:20,192
and this happens
with a certain probability

103
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:23,474
per contact and per unit type

104
00:05:23,726 --> 00:05:26,075
and this probability, we call beta.

105
00:05:26,275 --> 00:05:28,399
So, this is the transmission
probability

106
00:05:28,572 --> 00:05:31,572
what can also happen is that,
they can eventually

107
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,747
move into this recovered class,
where they clear the infection

108
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:38,954
and this happens
with probability gamma.

109
00:05:39,154 --> 00:05:43,217
and this is also per time step. So,
this is per contact in unit time

110
00:05:43,997 --> 00:05:46,434
step unit time,
and this is per unit time.

111
00:05:46,961 --> 00:05:49,522
and we are gonna go ahead
and take this simple model. 

112
00:05:49,713 --> 00:05:52,665
We are gonna implement this
on a two-dimensional grid.

113
00:05:52,989 --> 00:05:57,422
Why? A couple of reasons. No.1,
we do live in a spatial world.

114
00:05:57,633 --> 00:06:00,532
So, spatial considerations
are important considerations.

115
00:06:00,719 --> 00:06:03,194
When it comes to the spread
of infectious diseases

116
00:06:03,361 --> 00:06:06,012
and secondly as we've seen
in chapter five, it's actually

117
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,240
relatively easy to do, to implement

118
00:06:08,727 --> 00:06:11,607
and added bonus, it looks really
nice in a browser.

119
00:06:12,019 --> 00:06:14,919
So let's go ahead and implement
this SIR system

120
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:16,227
in Java Script.
