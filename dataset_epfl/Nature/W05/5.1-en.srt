1
00:00:04,111 --> 00:00:06,948
Welcome back. Nature in Code.
We are now on Chapter 5.

2
00:00:07,136 --> 00:00:10,811
Chapter 5  is all about spacial 
models. This is Lecture 1.

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,010
Chapter 5 is going to be a fun 
chapter. I mean I do hope that 

4
00:00:14,239 --> 00:00:18,026
you find all chapters interesting
but this one, I think, 

5
00:00:18,202 --> 00:00:21,577
experience has shown that it's quite
rewarding to learners because

6
00:00:21,763 --> 00:00:24,313
a) we're actually going to code
a lot and so we're really

7
00:00:24,487 --> 00:00:28,062
going to use those skills that
you gained in the past few chapters.

8
00:00:28,233 --> 00:00:32,746
Then second, at the end you get
this visual simulation,

9
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:35,347
spacial simulation that runs 
in your browser

10
00:00:35,516 --> 00:00:37,603
and that is really intriguing
to look at

11
00:00:37,749 --> 00:00:40,749
and I've also chosen it as the cover
of the book for that reason.

12
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:42,510
Let's get started.

13
00:00:42,746 --> 00:00:45,646
What are spacial models
and why do they matter?

14
00:00:45,826 --> 00:00:48,214
Well, so far we've made the 
following assumptions:

15
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:51,861
we have our individuals; diploid
individuals so they have 2 copies.

16
00:00:52,049 --> 00:00:55,199
For example here we have an A1 and 
A2 individual

17
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,213
Individuals then produce many, many 
gametes. For example 

18
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:08,462
A1 gametes and A2 gametes,
depending on their genotype of course

19
00:01:08,665 --> 00:01:12,390
and so they create many, many 
gametes and we eventually get

20
00:01:12,588 --> 00:01:16,651
this practically infinitely sized
gamete pool. 

21
00:01:16,825 --> 00:01:21,575
From this pool we're now drawing 
alleles to essentially

22
00:01:21,753 --> 00:01:28,178
create new individuals. So far
we've made 2 crucial 

23
00:01:28,419 --> 00:01:32,894
assumptions namely that drawing 
from this gamete pool 

24
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:36,614
was essentially a random process. 
That was the first assumption

25
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:39,342
and then the second assumption,
at least in Chapter 2 

26
00:01:39,538 --> 00:01:44,151
that we made was that population
size was infinite 

27
00:01:44,801 --> 00:01:47,989
so we would in fact draw infinitely 
many times. 

28
00:01:48,185 --> 00:01:50,797
Then later we relaxed this 
assumption and we said no,

29
00:01:50,975 --> 00:01:54,563
it's actually finite so we don't 
draw infinitely many times.

30
00:01:54,761 --> 00:01:58,361
We draw a certain number and that
introduces interesting 

31
00:01:58,540 --> 00:02:02,078
random sampling effects that 
cause genetic drift

32
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:05,264
but still in all of those models,
the assumption was that

33
00:02:05,446 --> 00:02:08,984
we draw randomly from this pool.

34
00:02:09,424 --> 00:02:13,986
Now, in a spacial model, that is 
potentially going to change

35
00:02:14,165 --> 00:02:17,853
because we're going to assume that
the mating between

36
00:02:18,036 --> 00:02:20,986
individuals will not be completely
random so we're not just

37
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:24,528
picking random gametes here;
 random alleles

38
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:28,858
but we're actually considering
where they are in space.

39
00:02:29,245 --> 00:02:33,433
Here's one way to think about this:
Imagine you have

40
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:40,160
an individual here and now
this individual will be mating

41
00:02:40,337 --> 00:02:43,462
with another individual
and thereby producing offspring

42
00:02:43,714 --> 00:02:47,502
so which are these other mating
individuals going to be?

43
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:50,746
Well, it's much more likely that
this is going to be 

44
00:02:51,097 --> 00:02:57,160
an individual that's close by
rather than individuals

45
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:57,812


46
00:02:57,330 --> 00:02:59,930
that are extremely far away.

47
00:03:00,133 --> 00:03:03,695
This may not be fully true.
Of course for modern humans.

48
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:06,877
We have long distance 
travel etc. but I mean 

49
00:03:07,068 --> 00:03:10,143
consider any other species or humans
in fact, hundreds or 

50
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:14,779
thousands of years ago.
Think about a mouse for example

51
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:19,138
somewhere in your backyard. Who is
this mouse going to mate with?

52
00:03:19,516 --> 00:03:22,804
Well, probably with mice that are in
the neighborhood. Not with mice

53
00:03:22,976 --> 00:03:25,314
that are a thousand miles
away and this is

54
00:03:25,507 --> 00:03:29,370
sort of the spacial consideration.
How can we model this notion that 

55
00:03:29,561 --> 00:03:35,361
you can only travel so far?
We can setup a world like this

56
00:03:35,551 --> 00:03:39,364
and say, this is our space.
You could also draw it like this

57
00:03:40,554 --> 00:03:44,341
and here you will have individuals
living in the space but 

58
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,545
here we just take a birdseye view
and now we're going to 

59
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:55,296
put individuals here for example,
randomly on this map.

60
00:03:55,657 --> 00:03:59,357
Now we start with the
observation that this individual

61
00:03:59,533 --> 00:04:04,433
here for example, is much more
likely to mate with this

62
00:04:04,624 --> 00:04:08,724
individual here that's close by
compared to this

63
00:04:08,985 --> 00:04:12,210
individual here which is rather
far away.

64
00:04:12,403 --> 00:04:16,041
That's really sort of the major
change that we're now going to

65
00:04:16,197 --> 00:04:19,297
implement compared to all the other
models that we've 

66
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:23,419
implemented so far.
In fact, this is not exactly the way

67
00:04:23,643 --> 00:04:28,306
we're going to do this because here,
as you saw, I just put these

68
00:04:28,494 --> 00:04:32,294
individuals randomly here.
Each of these individuals would

69
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:36,393
have some form of X and Y
co-ordinates in the 2 dimensional

70
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:41,590
space and I would have to calculate
for each pair the distance

71
00:04:41,812 --> 00:04:44,487
and how this maps the probability
of mating and so on.

72
00:04:44,724 --> 00:04:47,724
That's a bit too complicated.
We can actually simplify this

73
00:04:47,925 --> 00:04:52,187
even more and the way people usually
do this is by assuming that

74
00:04:52,381 --> 00:04:55,768
the world is essentially a grid.
What does this look like?

75
00:04:55,941 --> 00:05:00,228
This is a grid. These are the cells
of the grid and we can now make

76
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,350
the assumption that each cell
contains 1 individual.

77
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:09,229
That has a number of simplifying
 properties such as well,

78
00:05:09,418 --> 00:05:12,568
number 1, it's very easy to
calculate now, the number of

79
00:05:12,751 --> 00:05:16,013
individuals that live on this grid
because we can just 

80
00:05:16,235 --> 00:05:19,510
calculate the number of cells here
because each cell contains 

81
00:05:19,721 --> 00:05:22,271
1 individual.
Then we can also come up with rules

82
00:05:22,443 --> 00:05:26,556
about the movement that is 
allowed from cell to cell or the 

83
00:05:26,772 --> 00:05:30,472
mating probabilities among these
different cells.

84
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:34,006
Now, we're going to simplify things
quite a bit in this chapter

85
00:05:34,179 --> 00:05:36,804
and we're going to assume there's 
no movement so perhaps

86
00:05:37,014 --> 00:05:40,452
a bit like plants or trees;
sessile individuals but

87
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:44,640
you could in principle, add 
movement to your simulation

88
00:05:44,818 --> 00:05:47,905
if you wanted to.
The key point here is that of 

89
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:51,986
limited mating distance.
For example, let's zoom in on

90
00:05:52,167 --> 00:05:55,229
this cell here and say okay, we have
an individual here ... We have

91
00:05:55,527 --> 00:05:59,227
an individual in each cell but we're
just going to focus on this one now

92
00:05:59,462 --> 00:06:04,462
so who could this individual
mate with? So far, we have basically

93
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:07,657
assumed that it could mate with any
other randomly chosen

94
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:12,249
individual in this world.
We didn't explicitly model space

95
00:06:12,501 --> 00:06:16,901
but we did make that assumption that
each individual can mate

96
00:06:17,117 --> 00:06:20,530
with each other individual.
In fact, we didn't even bother to

97
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:24,439
consider individuals. We just picked
alleles from the gamete pool

98
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:27,400
but in effect, this would have the
same consequence; just 

99
00:06:27,565 --> 00:06:31,190
random individuals mating with
each other. Now that we have a

100
00:06:31,388 --> 00:06:35,150
spacial grid, we can limit this.
In the simplest case we could

101
00:06:35,332 --> 00:06:38,507
for example say well, there is a 
maximum distance for each

102
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:41,865
individual that it can choose a
mating partner from.

103
00:06:42,055 --> 00:06:46,630
For example, we could set this 
distance to 1 and then we'd get

104
00:06:46,842 --> 00:06:51,192
something like this. Here again,
this is our individual and 

105
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:55,198
we could say okay, we have this
maximum mating distance of 1 

106
00:06:55,381 --> 00:07:00,019
and now this individual can mate
with any of these individuals here

107
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:03,867
that live in the surrounding cells
but not with any of the others.

108
00:07:04,074 --> 00:07:06,674
We could expand this and we could
say no, you know what? 

109
00:07:06,871 --> 00:07:10,196
We're going to assume a mating 
distance of 2. This would look

110
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:16,076
like this. Here we have our
individual living here and

111
00:07:16,306 --> 00:07:20,194
the mating distance is now 2.
That means this individual

112
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:23,923
can now randomly choose any
individual to mate with that

113
00:07:24,129 --> 00:07:29,241
lives in this blue zone here but
not outside of the blue zone.

114
00:07:29,579 --> 00:07:33,741
Then we could take this even
further. We could essentially set 

115
00:07:33,938 --> 00:07:38,013
'd' to very large values so that the
zone gets larger and larger

116
00:07:38,245 --> 00:07:41,882
and eventually becomes so large that
it spans the entire world.

117
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:46,052
Then we would effectively be back at
 non-spacial dynamics. We would

118
00:07:46,233 --> 00:07:49,408
still have a spacial world
because we would still the grid

119
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:52,940
but the parameter will be chosen
in such a way that the dynamics

120
00:07:53,136 --> 00:07:58,136
will be exactly identical to the
non-spacial models because mating

121
00:07:58,346 --> 00:08:01,446
would essentially be random.
That's now quite intriguing

122
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:04,639
because if we built a model like
this, we can now simply tweak

123
00:08:04,852 --> 00:08:09,877
this parameter and very quickly
compare an entire range of models,

124
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:13,548
those that are very strictly
spacial and those that are

125
00:08:13,739 --> 00:08:17,477
in a sense, non-spacial because
random mating will still occur.

126
00:08:17,848 --> 00:08:22,460
This is another nice side property
of doing it like this.

127
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,439
What about the borders? 
Are there any kinds of meaningful

128
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:30,463
borders here? No, there are actually
not so let's think about how 

129
00:08:30,677 --> 00:08:35,740
this should work. Let's assume 
you have an individual that is 

130
00:08:35,971 --> 00:08:41,683
somewhere around here perhaps and
for some reason you say you

131
00:08:41,877 --> 00:08:45,102
have movement; this individual wants
to move over here. 

132
00:08:45,478 --> 00:08:48,703
You look at this grid and you would
say well, but it cant because

133
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:52,719
here there's this border. Well but
you can simply assume that

134
00:08:52,951 --> 00:08:56,288
any individual who moves
 out of here would immediately 

135
00:08:56,474 --> 00:09:00,762
re-enter the world here and
vice-versa; the same is true

136
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:04,875
for every border. An individual for
example who would move out 

137
00:09:05,101 --> 00:09:08,313
here would immediately re-enter
the world over here.

138
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:11,778
Effectively you don't have any
borders any more.

139
00:09:11,997 --> 00:09:15,559
This has interesting consequences
but the most important

140
00:09:15,755 --> 00:09:19,505
aspect is that you don't have these
side-effects of actually

141
00:09:19,689 --> 00:09:23,839
having walls in a world where
individuals cannot move

142
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:28,316
any further. From a practical
perspective that means we have to

143
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,651
think a little bit about those
mating songs so to speak.

144
00:09:31,837 --> 00:09:39,387
Say you have an individual here.
Now let's also say that we have

145
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:44,147
a mating distance of 1 so as we've
seen before, the mating area now

146
00:09:44,328 --> 00:09:49,691
the cells to choose a mating
partner from would be like this

147
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:54,213
but here the world ends in our
visualization. What are we

148
00:09:54,397 --> 00:09:58,635
going to do? Well, as we said, if
you move out of here, you re-enter

149
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:05,160
the world here so effectively this
is the other part of

150
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,013
this square. You have the 6 cells
or rather, the 5 cells because

151
00:10:09,206 --> 00:10:12,343
you're not going to mate with
yourself but you have these 5 cells

152
00:10:12,512 --> 00:10:17,812
here and then the 3 cells over here
as the range of individuals

153
00:10:18,005 --> 00:10:22,780
to choose from. In the extreme case,
you're going to look at this

154
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:26,573
individual here in the corner but
there is no corner. 

155
00:10:26,774 --> 00:10:30,237
This corner is just a visual
illusion because effectively

156
00:10:30,465 --> 00:10:36,077
the mating neighborhood here would
be ... Whoops. Let me use red; 

157
00:10:36,647 --> 00:10:41,884
would be this and then of course
it would continue here, right?

158
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:50,058
These 2 cells would be in fact the
one over here. These 2 cells

159
00:10:50,261 --> 00:10:57,711
down here would be those and the
one here would simply be this one. 

160
00:11:00,342 --> 00:11:04,379
This is how you would define the
mating neighborhood of a cell here

161
00:11:04,829 --> 00:11:09,529
You can see here; no borders so
let's implement such a world. 

162
00:11:09,882 --> 00:11:14,657
Now, again, a fair bit of warning.
We're going to write a lot of code

163
00:11:14,864 --> 00:11:18,252
here but of course that's why we're
here in the first place.

164
00:11:18,827 --> 00:11:21,702
There are 3 factors that make it a
little easier. First of all,

165
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:25,261
of course, I'll do it with you so
you can just follow me but

166
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:29,612
the second is also that you already
have all the tools in place.

167
00:11:30,122 --> 00:11:33,810
As you can see, this will obviously
be stored as a 2 dimensional

168
00:11:34,035 --> 00:11:37,610
array. We'll have a lot of
itterations, functions,

169
00:11:37,777 --> 00:11:41,727
control flow and so on and you
already know all of this.

170
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:46,393
The 3rd aspect, as I said, at the
end you'll have a very rewarding

171
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:50,119
visual experience. Alright so 
we have our work cut out for us.

172
00:11:50,335 --> 00:11:53,148
Let's do it. Let's get
started in the next lecture.
