1
00:00:03,863 --> 00:00:07,825
Welcome back. Nature, In Code. We're
in chapter five, lecture seven.

2
00:00:09,613 --> 00:00:08,003
So we just finished the
 implementation of the

3
00:00:09,801 --> 00:00:13,288
spatial model. It works nicely. 
It looks beautiful but 

4
00:00:13,471 --> 00:00:15,996
I'm going to delve a little 
deeper into one of the

5
00:00:16,156 --> 00:00:19,769
observations that we made, 
which is that we seem to be

6
00:00:19,970 --> 00:00:23,907
losing heterozygotes. We get these 
clusters of homozygotes,

7
00:00:24,088 --> 00:00:27,525
but the heterozygote counts 
seem to be going down.

8
00:00:27,711 --> 00:00:30,586
What is this? Where does this 
come from and how can

9
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:32,571
we quantify this, a little better?

10
00:00:32,727 --> 00:00:35,627
So if we look at the 
simulation here, what we can see

11
00:00:35,803 --> 00:00:38,741
very quickly when we reload 
this is that we very quickly seem

12
00:00:39,704 --> 00:00:42,641
 to be getting these white 
and black clusters here,

13
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:48,554
and those are clusters of A1A1 
and A2A2 homozygotes. 

14
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:52,456
And in particular when we look 
here in the console are these

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,128
absolute numbers of the
heterozygotes,

16
00:00:56,303 --> 00:01:00,916
you can see that those go down 
relatively quickly for example

17
00:01:01,093 --> 00:01:02,831
here around 3,000.

18
00:01:03,007 --> 00:01:06,244
Now, recall that we started them
at Hardy Weinberg frequencies

19
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:11,059
with a one milli frequency 
of .5, 10,000 individuals,

20
00:01:11,244 --> 00:01:15,769
so are 5,000 heterozygotes 
in the very beginning.

21
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:20,430
But very quickly, this number drops
down to about 3,000 individuals.

22
00:01:20,607 --> 00:01:24,532
And it would keep going down until
eventually all heterozygotes

23
00:01:24,712 --> 00:01:25,887
will be gone.

24
00:01:26,048 --> 00:01:28,835
So what is driving this?
Well, we will make the observation

25
00:01:28,994 --> 00:01:32,445
here that we get these clusters
in white and these are A1A1

26
00:01:32,633 --> 00:01:38,108
homozygotes and here,
the A2A2 homozygotes.

27
00:01:38,293 --> 00:01:42,930
And we basically observed that
because we have a limited mating

28
00:01:43,113 --> 00:01:49,076
distance here, individuals are 
much more likely to mate with the

29
00:01:49,261 --> 00:01:52,223
same genotype that's in the vicinity

30
00:01:52,396 --> 00:01:57,083
And so, of course, it's not easy
to see if A1A1 mates with A1A1,

31
00:01:57,273 --> 00:02:02,435
it can only ever produce A1A1.
Same with A2A2, if A2A2 mates

32
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:06,348
with A2A2, it can only ever 
produce A2A2. However if 

33
00:02:06,522 --> 00:02:11,122
heterozygotes mate with each other,
A1A2 with A1A2, you get all

34
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:14,728
three possible outcomes, 
all three possible genotypes.

35
00:02:14,914 --> 00:02:19,964
And so that is driving the
heterozygotes down and we can

36
00:02:20,145 --> 00:02:24,058
ask ourselves, "Okay, but we still
at Hardy Weinberg Frequencies

37
00:02:24,237 --> 00:02:28,899
and what is exactly a good 
quantitative measure of this

38
00:02:29,077 --> 00:02:31,252
observation?" So let's find out.

39
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:35,212
So we seem to be losing
heterozygosity and we can measure

40
00:02:35,386 --> 00:02:37,786
this with the so called F 
statistics.

41
00:02:37,961 --> 00:02:41,011
Now, what is the F statistic? 
Very generally,

42
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,017
 this is about expected 
and observed value. 

43
00:02:44,184 --> 00:02:47,459
You have some expected value.
You have some served value

44
00:02:47,648 --> 00:02:51,910
and so now you divide this
difference by the expected value.

45
00:02:52,076 --> 00:02:55,226
So concretely when we care 
about heterozygosity here,

46
00:02:55,401 --> 00:03:00,864
this is the expected heterozygosity
minus the observed heterozygosity

47
00:03:01,042 --> 00:03:04,879
and then divided by the 
expected heterozygosity. 

48
00:03:05,072 --> 00:03:07,722
So why this formula?
What does it stand for?

49
00:03:07,899 --> 00:03:12,324
Well, it's actually a very generic
formula if you think about it,

50
00:03:12,498 --> 00:03:16,748
and you use this type of formula
all the time unknowingly

51
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:20,291
in your head, because essentially
what this formula says right,

52
00:03:20,469 --> 00:03:24,044
is that you have some expected
value, so E here,

53
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:29,781
and then you have some observed 
value, let's say this is less. 

54
00:03:30,831 --> 00:03:33,718
So this is the observed value
and as a consequence

55
00:03:33,904 --> 00:03:37,517
I'm going to draw this here in red.
You have something that is

56
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:43,927
 missing, E-O, so the expected minus
what you're actually observing.

57
00:03:44,175 --> 00:03:49,475
So this is the missing value,
but now it's relatively difficult

58
00:03:49,648 --> 00:03:53,498
 to make much sense of this missing
value in absolute terms.

59
00:03:53,677 --> 00:03:57,239
It only makes sense if you put
it in the perspective of what

60
00:03:57,418 --> 00:03:59,218
you expected in the first place.

61
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:02,170
 And this is what this formula 
captures, so let me give you 

62
00:04:02,348 --> 00:04:05,360
an example that's completely 
outside of biology

63
00:04:05,552 --> 00:04:10,165
that's related to everyday usage,
for example money.

64
00:04:10,422 --> 00:04:14,647
Let's say you expect a payment
of $100,

65
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:18,852
and now-- say this is the expected
and now you're getting your

66
00:04:19,027 --> 00:04:22,864
 payment back but it's only $80.

67
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,605
In other words, the expected minus
observed value here is $20, right. 

68
00:04:28,793 --> 00:04:30,555
That's what's missing. 

69
00:04:31,148 --> 00:04:34,348
So $20 is that a lot or not a lot?

70
00:04:34,594 --> 00:04:39,657
Well, on the face of it, it is a lot
but we have to put it in a context,

71
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:44,175
right. I mean here, you're basically
missing 20% of your payment.

72
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:46,921
That's quite large. 
So you know, something to be

73
00:04:47,094 --> 00:04:48,006
worried about.

74
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:52,878
On the other hand let's say you
would be expecting a payment

75
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:59,160
 for some reason, don't ask me why,
of $100 million, okay,

76
00:04:59,332 --> 00:05:11,669
$100 million and now you're getting
only "$99,999,980."

77
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:16,447
So you get the idea.
The quantity E minus O here

78
00:05:16,619 --> 00:05:20,419
is the same. The difference is
you're missing $20,

79
00:05:20,598 --> 00:05:25,536
but now in the context of the
expectation of the $100 million,

80
00:05:25,709 --> 00:05:28,847
that's probably not going to
keep you awake at night.

81
00:05:29,031 --> 00:05:33,356
So it is simply a way to quantify
what is missing,

82
00:05:33,543 --> 00:05:36,680
what is the difference between 
the expected and the observed

83
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:41,335
in the context of the
overall expected value.

84
00:05:42,042 --> 00:05:44,729
All right, so with this knowledge
in hand, we can easily

85
00:05:44,911 --> 00:05:50,011
now calculate the F statistics
and print it into the console.

86
00:05:50,193 --> 00:05:52,768
 So currently, we're calling
this print data function

87
00:05:52,961 --> 00:05:55,949
 in run generation and if we look
at the print data function,

88
00:05:56,137 --> 00:06:01,787
it's here. What it does is it simply
counts all the three genotypes,

89
00:06:01,966 --> 00:06:04,716
basically the absolute number
of the three genotypes.

90
00:06:04,893 --> 00:06:08,143
And then it output those here
and also outputs the

91
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:09,463
generation counter.

92
00:06:09,646 --> 00:06:13,183
So here we can add some code
to calculate the F statistics

93
00:06:13,352 --> 00:06:15,739
because here we have all
the information we need.

94
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:19,171
We know exactly how
many genotypes there are.

95
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:22,457
All right, so first of all,
we need to figure out 

96
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:25,087
what is the actual population
size at the moment?

97
00:06:25,269 --> 00:06:29,282
 So we are going to say here 
var N equals A1A1

98
00:06:29,466 --> 00:06:32,466
 plus A1A2 plus A2A2, and of course,
there would be another to

99
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:38,802
do this namely, simply multiply
grid lengths times grid length

100
00:06:38,986 --> 00:06:41,811
and this if of course also the
population size but

101
00:06:41,997 --> 00:06:45,209
we can do it like this here. This 
should be exactly the same number.

102
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:49,560
And now we can calculate
the observed heterozygosity,

103
00:06:49,732 --> 00:06:52,969
right, because we know the number,
the absolute number

104
00:06:53,146 --> 00:06:57,034
of A1A2 genotypes. We know the 
population size,

105
00:06:57,328 --> 00:07:02,965
 so we can simply say,
Ho, so the observed heterozygosity,

106
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:09,526
simply the A1A2 genotypes divide
by the total number of genotypes.

107
00:07:10,185 --> 00:07:13,423
And that is now our observed
heterozygosity.

108
00:07:13,691 --> 00:07:16,079
Okay, so that's the 
first bit that we need.

109
00:07:16,246 --> 00:07:18,508
Now, what's the second
information that we need?

110
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:21,278
Well, we need the
expected heterozygosity.

111
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,243
So the expected heterozygosity
as you know,

112
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:27,121
that's the one that we would
expect on the Hardy Weinberg

113
00:07:27,293 --> 00:07:32,568
Frequencies, and that is going to be
2PQ has we've learned much earlier.

114
00:07:33,573 --> 00:07:37,110
And we know P, we know Q.

115
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:42,727
Q is simply 1 minus P,
but how do we know P?

116
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,820
Well, we know the number of
A1A1 genotypes

117
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,975
and we know the number
of A1A2 genotypes.

118
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:53,384
And so we can now simply
calculate P by saying,

119
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:55,659
and I'm going to use
here a local variable.

120
00:07:56,017 --> 00:08:01,492
Okay, it's twice the number 
of A1A1 genotypes,

121
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:05,609
because each A1A1 genotypes 
has two A1 alleles,

122
00:08:05,957 --> 00:08:08,432
okay, plus

123
00:08:09,517 --> 00:08:13,342
the A1A2 genotypes.

124
00:08:13,713 --> 00:08:19,276
Here, each A1A2 genotype 
provides one--

125
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:25,830
I'm going to put this in 
parentheses, provides one A1 allele.

126
00:08:27,008 --> 00:08:29,933
So I'm just going to put all of
these in parentheses just to be

127
00:08:30,119 --> 00:08:33,332
clear about the order even
though this wouldn't be necessary.

128
00:08:33,516 --> 00:08:36,079
The inner one wouldn't be necessary.

129
00:08:36,438 --> 00:08:41,176
So these are now the absolute
numbers of A1 alleles that

130
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:45,083
we have in this population,
right, two per A1A1 genotype

131
00:08:45,271 --> 00:08:47,783
and one per A1A2 genotype.

132
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:51,206
How many alleles do we have
in this population?

133
00:08:51,379 --> 00:08:56,404
Well, simply we have 2N,
so 2 times N alleles.

134
00:08:57,177 --> 00:09:03,290
So this is our P and therefore our
expected heterozygosity,

135
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:04,957
HE

136
00:09:05,946 --> 00:09:08,721
 with these numbers is 2PQ.

137
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:14,113
So 2 times P times Q, 
which is 1 minus P.

138
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:17,935
All right, now, we have 
everything we need.

139
00:09:18,114 --> 00:09:21,289
We simply need to define here
a variable that I'm going to

140
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:24,801
call F or the F statistics
and that is simply

141
00:09:24,979 --> 00:09:30,629
as we just learned the
expected minus the observed

142
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:35,597
divided by the expected value,

143
00:09:35,846 --> 00:09:38,021
HE.

144
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:48,896
So now we can simply log
this console, "F = " + F,

145
00:09:49,336 --> 00:09:52,323
then you strain the 
incantation here.

146
00:09:53,361 --> 00:09:58,423
All right, so let's save this,
and first, what we're actually 

147
00:09:58,608 --> 00:10:02,233
going to do, I want to make sure
you know what to expect

148
00:10:02,417 --> 00:10:06,379
under completely random
circumstances with global mating. 

149
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:10,930
So let's put the max mating distance
value here back to 50

150
00:10:11,114 --> 00:10:13,639
so that we get global mating.

151
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:17,591
All right, save and then let's go
back to the browser

152
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:20,057
and reload this here.

153
00:10:21,339 --> 00:10:25,139
And so here we can now see
that F hovers zero.

154
00:10:25,314 --> 00:10:28,639
Sometimes it's slightly negative,
sometimes it's slightly positive,

155
00:10:28,828 --> 00:10:31,828
but it hovers around zero 
and what that means is that

156
00:10:32,024 --> 00:10:36,774
the expected and the observed
are essentially identical.

157
00:10:37,044 --> 00:10:41,207
Small of course differences due
to stsarcastic effect, but the 

158
00:10:41,388 --> 00:10:44,525
F statistics is essentially zero.

159
00:10:44,779 --> 00:10:47,516
And so that's exactly
what we would expect.

160
00:10:47,703 --> 00:10:54,116
 The genotype frequencies are always
at Hardy Weinberg Frequencies here.

161
00:10:54,293 --> 00:10:56,730
The P values may have of course 
changed over time

162
00:10:56,908 --> 00:10:59,270
 and they eventually will, 
because this is still a

163
00:10:59,445 --> 00:11:02,845
finite population size,
and so we're going to lose one

164
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:06,262
of the two alleles.
But as we do this

165
00:11:06,446 --> 00:11:09,533
the genotypes remain in
Hardy Weinberg Frequencies.

166
00:11:10,533 --> 00:11:14,746
Now, let's go back to the code 
and set max mating distance back

167
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:18,966
to one so that we get this really
one severe limitation

168
00:11:19,154 --> 00:11:22,267
in the mating distance
and therefore a lot of inbreeding.

169
00:11:22,437 --> 00:11:25,550
I'm going to save this and 
now we're going to reload this.

170
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:29,397
So now, we get these islands here 
of homozygotes, and as we can see 

171
00:11:29,571 --> 00:11:36,971
here very quickly this F statistics
goes up about .3 or even

172
00:11:37,141 --> 00:11:38,653
higher eventually.

173
00:11:38,841 --> 00:11:44,478
So that means there's roughly 30%
difference in the expected

174
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:46,583
and in the observed value.

175
00:11:47,165 --> 00:11:51,415
And so this is now a good
quantitative measure for the extent

176
00:11:51,606 --> 00:11:55,343
 to which heterozygosity is reduced.

177
00:11:56,387 --> 00:12:01,549
Here we can now see this goes very
quickly to relatively high values

178
00:12:01,824 --> 00:12:06,874
and here we can see this visually,
but we didn't quite have,

179
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:11,208
you know, the quantitative
means to capture this. 

180
00:12:11,388 --> 00:12:16,101
This F statistics now says here 
over a third of the heterozygosity

181
00:12:16,287 --> 00:12:19,637
is essentially missing due 
to inbreeding.

182
00:12:20,067 --> 00:12:22,979
All right, so this concludes 
this lecture and this chapter, 

183
00:12:23,153 --> 00:12:27,540
so you implemented a spatial
explicit individual based sarcastic

184
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:31,635
simulation for population genetic
process in java script.

185
00:12:31,837 --> 00:12:32,862
So, well done.

186
00:12:33,065 --> 00:12:35,753
One of the effects as we saw 
of space considerations

187
00:12:35,934 --> 00:12:38,384
in particular limited
mating distances,

188
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:42,762
which is what happens in the real
world is the effect of inbreeding

189
00:12:42,955 --> 00:12:46,767
and its consequence, 
the reduction in heterozygosity.

190
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:51,216
And heterozygosity is an important
measure in an evolutionary sense,

191
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:53,811
because it is a measure
of genetic variation.

192
00:12:54,008 --> 00:12:57,958
So the bigger picture here is now
we've learned about the three forces

193
00:12:58,118 --> 00:13:01,955
that can affect evolution,
genetic drift, mutation

194
00:13:02,135 --> 00:13:03,998
and now spatial considerations. 

195
00:13:04,181 --> 00:13:07,343
I also want to mention that 
inbreeding is by no means

196
00:13:07,526 --> 00:13:10,589
the only effect of spatial
considerations, but I wanted to 

197
00:13:10,776 --> 00:13:13,913
focus here on this one
because it is an important one.

198
00:13:14,367 --> 00:13:19,317
So, we have so far not spoken 
about the queen of the four forces,

199
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,930
of evolution and that is
natural selection, but we'll get

200
00:13:23,111 --> 00:13:26,773
to it right away in the
next chapter. So I'll see you there.
