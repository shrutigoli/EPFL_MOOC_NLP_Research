00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,600
Welcome back Nature, In Code. 
We're in Chapter 3, Lecture 13.

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,530
We're approaching the end of this chapter.
Chapter 3 is a very rich chapter.

3
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,300
We learned new Java script 
concepts. We learned how to

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:19,350
visualize our data using child script 
in the browser.

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:23,480
We developed stochastic simulations
of genetic drift and we learned about

6
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,000
genetic drift and we learned that 
it acts to reduce genetic

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,190
variation and we learned 
about the process,

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:33,590
the speed of the process and how it 
depends on the population size.

9
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:36,310
So quite a lot of information there.

10
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:39,060
So in these last few lectures

11
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,670
I'd like to introduce one more concept 
that is very important in

12
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:45,930
the context of genetic drift and 
that's the concept of the

13
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,270
effective population size.

14
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:51,200
So we'll do in this lecture 
I'll explain this idea.

15
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,230
The basic idea behind it.

16
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,750
And then in the final lecturers 
we'll implement this idea,

17
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,110
using the code that we 
previously developed,

18
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,440
so let's get started.

19
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:03,720
So what is the effective population size?

20
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,880
Well, here's what it is.

21
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:08,300
It's the size of an ideal population 
--and we'll talk about what

22
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,520
that means--that shows the same decay 
of genetic variation.

23
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:20,390
There's some decay of genetic variation 
as the actual population of interest.

24
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:25,150
So it is the size of an ideal population 
that shows the same decay

25
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,330
of genetic variation as the actual 
population of interest.

26
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:32,810
So what does it mean?
Let's make an example.

27
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:37,530
So let's say you're working with 
a population that you can

28
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,990
observe and where you can measure the 
genetic variation.

29
00:01:41,990 --> 00:01:46,750
Let's say you could measure this over a 
number of generations and then

30
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,910
you could plot it something like this.

31
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:53,120
It decays in some in some way.

32
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:57,760
So this is now your actual population.

33
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,750
We're gonna call it census population.

34
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:07,410
Let's say you have a population 
of N=200.

35
00:02:07,410 --> 00:02:11,690
So 200 individuals in your population 
and you observe this decay of

36
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:15,050
genetic variation. Now could 
go ahead and say,

37
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:18,800
"I just learned about this 
mathematical framework that

38
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,900
will allow me to predict the decay of 
genetic variation due to drift

39
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:27,640
all they need to do now is to plug 
in this number, N, which is 200

40
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:30,730
and I should get the correct prediction"
And then you go ahead and

41
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:36,240
do this and you find something 
like this that doesn't quite match.

42
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,390
So what's going on here.

43
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:42,740
So this is the prediction right in 
your ideal population.

44
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:49,480
So this is the population 
of this mathematical model: N=200.

45
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,120
So why do we call this ideal?

46
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:56,640
Keep in mind, we're still working
in this extremely simplifying world.

47
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,160
I mean we just came from Hardy Weinberg,

48
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:03,010
where everything was extremely simplified 
for various reasons.

49
00:03:03,010 --> 00:03:04,950
The only change we made now

50
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,140
going from chapter 2
to chapter 3 is that we,

51
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:12,240
change this assumption that the 
population was infinite

52
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,410
to a finite population such as N=200.

53
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,990
But there are still many many

54
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:20,890
simplifying assumptions here like 
we don't have any sex or gender.

55
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,950
We don't have any overlapping generations.

56
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:29,060
We don't have any spatial structuring; 
none of that realistic stuff.

57
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:33,970
But of course your actual population 
and has all these things

58
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,050
because it's a real world population.

59
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:40,160
But the population of our mathematical 
model doesn't.

60
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:45,890
So this is a very idealized population 
hence the word, <i>ideal</i>.

61
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:51,590
So what you could do this,
you could say,

62
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:55,080
how do I have to change this number 
so I do get this pattern and

63
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,780
then he tweak this a little bit 
in your model and you finally

64
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:03,520
find a number that recreates 
this pattern quite well.

65
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:12,170
And let's say you find this number to be
your ideal population of N=100.

66
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:18,400
So if you plug in N=100 
into these formula, into this framework,

67
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:23,580
then you do indeed get exactly this 
pattern that you observe in

68
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,590
your actual population,
your census population and so

69
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,850
this is now the effective population side
so in your case,

70
00:04:31,850 --> 00:04:33,610
the effects population size,

71
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:38,430
which is usually denoted as "Ne" is 100.

72
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,500
Why? Because even though 
your population, your actual population

73
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:48,650
has 200 individuals--
from a genetic perspective it

74
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:54,420
behaves like an idealized population 
of 100 individuals.

75
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,930
And this is really the important number.
To some extent you can argue,

76
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,240
well it doesn't really matter

77
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,370
how many individuals
you do observe in the population

78
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:09,420
The question is, <i>how</i> does that population
behave from a genetic perspective

79
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:13,410
assuming of course you are interested in 
the genetics of that population.

80
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,920
That is therefore the interesting number 
from a genetics perspective;

81
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,360
it's effective population size.

82
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,380
Why are we even talking about this?

83
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:28,030
Isn't this some kind of
"strange edge case?"

84
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:34,730
No, it actually turns out that in almost 
all cases, the effective population size

85
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:38,770
is actually <i>smaller</i>
than the census population size--

86
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,990
and in many cases actually 
substantially so.

87
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:47,070
So really substantially smaller than 
the census population.

88
00:05:47,070 --> 00:05:51,080
And if you don't know about this concept 
then you're going to make

89
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,250
all kinds of wrong predictions about 
your population because

90
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,590
you're simply only ever using this N 
that you measured

91
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:59,840
but your population behaves
very differently

92
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:01,720
from a genetics perspective.

93
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:05,080
so I want to give you one example 
where this is the case,

94
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,520
and where the affected population 
size can indeed be much,

95
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,060
much smaller than the actual 
population size.

96
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,690
So here's the example.

97
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:18,320
We have so far assumed implicitly 
or explicitly in the code

98
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:23,640
that the population size remains 
constant over time.

99
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,870
Now in reality this might not be true.

100
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,080
Your population size might fluctuate...

101
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,470
this might look even more chaotic,

102
00:06:31,470 --> 00:06:34,920
but a very common case where 
this is not true,

103
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:40,020
is that you have a population size 
that is fairly constant over time

104
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:43,820
and for one reason or another,
it suddenly crashes down

105
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,110
to very low levels and then eventually 
comes back up to the previous levels.

106
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,250
And this is a so-called 
population bottleneck.

107
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,120
This can happen in many 
cases for example,

108
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,460
individuals from a large population 
may split off and migrate away

109
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,360
to another location and build 
a new population there

110
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,230
from a few initial individuals.

111
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:14,650
This is something that's happened 
time and time again.

112
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:18,860
For example, when human started
colonizing the planet--

113
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:24,030
it still happens of course all the time
in biological systems...

114
00:07:24,030 --> 00:07:26,590
Another example that comes to mind is

115
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:32,630
when viral or bacterial populations 
transmit themselves

116
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:35,680
from one host to the next--
as happens all the time with

117
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,390
bacterial infections and
viral infections such as influenza,

118
00:07:39,390 --> 00:07:40,290
and so on.

119
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:44,640
So basically, what happens is a host 
has a very large population

120
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:51,800
of viral or bacterial
individuals inside the body

121
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,980
and then somehow transmits this to 
another susceptible individual.

122
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:01,150
Now not all of the bacteria or all
of the viral particles get transmitted.

123
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:06,320
Only a very small population 
get transmitted and in that new host,

124
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:08,680
they start growing rapidly,

125
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,920
creating a new large population size.

126
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:15,950
So these populations constantly 
go through rather severe bottlenecks

127
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,750
Which in most extreme cases even be

128
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:23,860
just one or two particles
or bacterial cells.

129
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:26,860
So bottlenecks occur all the time.

130
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,820
So what are the effects of bottlenecks?

131
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:34,360
Well we can easily understand this 
by taking an extreme example

132
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:40,690
where we have a population at 
a given size then it crashes dramatically.

133
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,290
And then in the next generation 
goes back up to the previous levels.

134
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:47,700
The reality looks probably more like this,

135
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:52,130
but this is a good sort of simplified 
example to see what's going on.

136
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:55,530
And we can simply assume now 
that we have for example,

137
00:08:55,530 --> 00:09:00,660
1,000 individuals here, then it crashes 
down to 10 individuals.

138
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:04,050
And then it goes back up
to 1,000 individuals.

139
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,990
So 3 generations.

140
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:07,950
A dramatic change in the middle.

141
00:09:07,950 --> 00:09:10,020
What is the effect of 
population size here?

142
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,770
How does this population behave from 
a genetic perspective?

143
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,310
One way you could now approach 
this is you could say,

144
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:18,040
Well, I'm gonna take the average,

145
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:23,950
so I got a thousand individuals and 
then I have 10 and then have 1,000 again.

146
00:09:23,950 --> 00:09:26,070
And I'm going to divide this by 3

147
00:09:26,070 --> 00:09:30,810
And this gives me roughly 670 individuals.

148
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,250
So that's one way to look at it.

149
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:38,180
The take home message of this lectures
is that this way would be very wrong.

150
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:44,090
If you would assume now your population 
behaves like an average of 607 individuals

151
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:48,000
From a genetics perspective
that will be very misleading.

152
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:48,910
It does not.

153
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:51,900
Why does it not? 
Because the effective population size

154
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:54,670
is not calculated as the average.

155
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:56,430
It's another type of mean.

156
00:09:56,430 --> 00:10:00,300
This is what we're used to in everyday 
usage taking the mean.

157
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,500
This is in fact the arithmetic mean.

158
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,950
There are many other means.

159
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:06,180
One of those means is the harmonic mean.

160
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,330
What is the harmonic mean
of a set of numbers?

161
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,480
x1 x2...

162
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,320
x3 and so on.

163
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:19,560
xn, okay.

164
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,560
Well, here's how it's defined.

165
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:32,260
It is N divided by 1 over x1
+ 1 over x2 + 1 over x3 and so on.

166
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,460
+ 1over xn.

167
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:39,400
That is the harmonic mean and the 
the effective population size is

168
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,040
the harmonic mean of the population 
sizes over time.

169
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:46,460
And so we can now plug in these numbers

170
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:51,030
to calculate the harmonic 
mean So let's do that.

171
00:10:51,030 --> 00:10:53,690
Again, right. This is the situation.

172
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:59,770
1,000 and then 10 and then 1,000.

173
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:07,340
So harmonic mean is 3 because 
we have three numbers...

174
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:15,480
Over 1 over 1,000 + 1 over 10

175
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,320
+ plus 1 over 1,000.

176
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,630
So what is this?

177
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:32,890
Well this is equal to 3 
over 0.001 + 0.1 + 0.001.

178
00:11:32,890 --> 00:11:40,180
Which is 3 over 0.102.

179
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:44,520
And that is roughly 30, okay.

180
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:48,840
And keep in mind before,
when we just calculated the average,

181
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:52,320
we had 670 individuals.

182
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,860
So this population behaves, from 
a genetic perspective,

183
00:11:56,860 --> 00:12:02,010
as if it were only 30 individuals 
and you would've assu--

184
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:06,630
Anyone who doesn't know about 
this would have assumed 670 individuals.

185
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:12,430
That's an underestimate
of 20 factor 20, roughly.

186
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,370
So an extreme difference between the 
effective population size and

187
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:21,170
the average; the real average.

188
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:25,600
In fact, if we now assumed--
let's assume that we have here

189
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,260
10,000 individuals. 
Then it crashes to 10,

190
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:31,940
and then it goes back up
to 10,000 individuals.

191
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:35,710
So our calculation would simply be 
here now 1 over 10,000

192
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:38,310
+ 1 over 10 + 1 over 10,000.

193
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:43,270
Correspondingly we would have to
add another 0 here and another 0 here,

194
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:48,140
and this now would really be 0.1002

195
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:51,580
<i>but</i>, this would still be roughly 30.

196
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,670
Nothing really changes here about 
this equation that's in...

197
00:12:55,670 --> 00:12:57,540
would have a substantial effect.

198
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:02,730
However, the average is actually 6,700.

199
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:08,990
So now we could in fact underestimate 
or rather <i>overestimate</i>,

200
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:12,620
excuse me, the size by a factor 200.

201
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:18,550
We would think this big population 
behaves like 6,700 individuals,

202
00:13:18,550 --> 00:13:23,550
but indeed it's still only behaves 
as if they were only 30 individuals.

203
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:26,800
Which will have a very, very
different dynamic as we now know

204
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,650
in terms of genetic drift.

205
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:33,300
So you could increase these numbers 
as much as you wanted to.

206
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:36,510
It doesn't matter how many zeroes 
you're going to add here.

207
00:13:36,510 --> 00:13:42,040
You're just going to have to add zeroes here
which would just push this 2 further out

208
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,390
but nothing fundamentally changes 
about the fact that this will be

209
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,360
roughly 30 individuals.

210
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,810
So it's not these numbers here that 
determine the overall effect

211
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,860
on the population size and 
effective population size.

212
00:13:54,860 --> 00:14:00,310
But it's this number here and that's 
just you know a necessity of

213
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,670
the definition of the harmonic 
mean is that these numbers,

214
00:14:03,670 --> 00:14:07,200
the small numbers have a much 
much bigger impact.

215
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:10,360
They're the ones who are basically
driving the whole thing.

216
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,090
And so that's why
these bottlenecks are so important.

217
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:17,320
They drive the whole thing in a way 
where what's up here

218
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:19,190
becomes almost irrelevant.

219
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,890
And if you don't know this--
as you can see here--

220
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:26,350
you can very quickly, substantially
overestimate your population size--

221
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,970
your effective population size.

222
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:30,620
You could think it's <i>thousands</i>
of individuals,

223
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,220
but instead it's just dozens.

224
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:36,490
So this is the take home message here.

225
00:14:36,490 --> 00:14:38,620
Bottlenecks happen all the time.

226
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:43,450
It's one of the examples where the 
effective population size is smaller.

227
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,600
It's fundamentally, substantially 
smaller than just the average.

228
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,730
You can of course just
accept this at face value,

229
00:14:52,730 --> 00:14:53,940
which is what I had to do

230
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,200
back in the day when
I learned about this stuff.

231
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,430
You're in fact, 
in a much better position now,

232
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:01,830
because you have code in place 
where you can now go

233
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:05,690
and implement these bottlenecks and see 
if that is really true.

234
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:10,000
See if your population really behaves 
in a way that's captured by

235
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:11,590
this harmonic mean.

236
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,040
So you're in a much better position 
and we should go ahead and

237
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,920
implement this now using 
our simulation code.

238
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,200
So you just learned about this important 
concept of the effective population size.

239
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:25,490
Which is really the important 
population size to know

240
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,870
if you want to know how
the population behaves

241
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,960
from a genetic perspective.

242
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:35,810
And in the next videos, we're going to
implement this idea in child script.

243
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:37,550
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
