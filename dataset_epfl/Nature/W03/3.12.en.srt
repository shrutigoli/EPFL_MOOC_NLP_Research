00:00:03,368 --> 00:00:06,527
Welcome back, <i>Nature in Code</i>,
we're in Chapter 3, lecture 12.

2
00:00:06,527 --> 00:00:10,178
In this lecture I'd like to develop
this third insight

3
00:00:10,178 --> 00:00:12,098
that I promised in the last lecture,

4
00:00:12,098 --> 00:00:14,256
that we could gain 
from this simple formula.

5
00:00:14,256 --> 00:00:17,056
So we left off with this observation here,

6
00:00:17,056 --> 00:00:22,167
namely that the genetic variation
in the next generation is this term here:

7
00:00:22,167 --> 00:00:28,368
<i>(1 - 1 / 2 N)</i> times the genetic variation
at this point.

8
00:00:28,738 --> 00:00:32,638
And so, from this simple formula 
we could deduce two major insights,

9
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:39,538
namely that genetic drift
acts to reduce genetic variation

10
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:42,266
because this term
is always smaller than one.

11
00:00:42,266 --> 00:00:44,379
So that was probably the major insight.

12
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:48,729
And the second insight was
that this crucially depends

13
00:00:48,729 --> 00:00:50,679
on the population size.

14
00:00:50,679 --> 00:00:54,967
So if the population size is small,
this term will be smaller

15
00:00:54,967 --> 00:00:57,110
and so the effect
is going to be stronger.

16
00:00:57,910 --> 00:01:00,450
And now we would like
to develop a third insight

17
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,614
and that has to do with the timing.

18
00:01:03,104 --> 00:01:08,171
So if we start observing
the genetic variation in the beginning,

19
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:10,091
and I'm going to call this <i>H_0</i>

20
00:01:10,091 --> 00:01:15,991
with the index zero,
just to denote the beginning

21
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:19,304
then we can easily calculate
the genetic variation

22
00:01:19,304 --> 00:01:21,573
in the next generation,
so <i>H_1</i>,

23
00:01:21,573 --> 00:01:24,219
by using exactly this formula,
so this is simply going to be

24
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:29,953
<i>(1 - 1 / (2 N))</i>
times what we have in H_0.

25
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:34,702
Correspondingly in the next generation,
so <i>H_2</i>, I would have

26
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:39,823
<i>(1 - 1 / (2 N)) H_1</i>,

27
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:44,443
and I've already expressed <i>H_1</i> here
in terms of <i>H_0</i>,

28
00:01:44,443 --> 00:01:47,083
so I can basically replace this

29
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:54,474
by writing this term,
<i>(1 - 1 / (2 N)) H_0</i>.

30
00:01:55,664 --> 00:01:59,179
And then, in <i>H_3</i>, exact same principle,

31
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:04,956
<i>(1 - 1 / (2 N))</i>
times the genetic variation before

32
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:09,388
so that would be H_2,
and, again, I've already expressed H_2

33
00:02:09,848 --> 00:02:14,325
up here, in terms of H_0,
I'm going to replace this again.

34
00:02:14,325 --> 00:02:16,238
I'm just going to do this one more time.

35
00:02:16,598 --> 00:02:22,588
So <i>(1 - 1 / (2 N))</i> times <i>(1 - 1 / (2 N))</i>

36
00:02:22,588 --> 00:02:24,710
times <i>H_0</i> and so on.

37
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,298
So you can see that <i>H_t</i>

38
00:02:30,798 --> 00:02:32,798
can be calculated by simply saying,

39
00:02:32,798 --> 00:02:39,305
I have to multiply (1 - 1 / (2 N))<i>
H times, so </i>(1 - 1 / (2 N))*

40
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:43,288
to the power of t, times <i>H_0</i>.

41
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:46,450
And so this now tells us
something interesting as well.

42
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:50,980
It tells us that as t goes to infinity,

43
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:54,480
so in a very long time span,

44
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:58,761
this term will reduce to zero

45
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:03,131
and so genetic variation will go to zero.

46
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:05,110
And that's also a crucial insight.

47
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:07,311
It's not the insight
that I was talking about,

48
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:10,414
but it's also a crucial insight
just to realize that genetic drift

49
00:03:10,414 --> 00:03:12,701
will not only reduce genetic variation

50
00:03:12,701 --> 00:03:15,492
it will act to completely eliminate it.

51
00:03:15,492 --> 00:03:18,371
And that's actually 
quite a profound thought,

52
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,842
if you think about it.

53
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:22,993
In the absence of any other process

54
00:03:22,993 --> 00:03:26,993
genetic variation would be 
completely lost from the world,

55
00:03:26,993 --> 00:03:29,642
so there could be no genetic variation

56
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:33,004
because random chance would
essentially eliminate it.

57
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,974
Genetic drift would eliminate it.

58
00:03:34,974 --> 00:03:36,686
And so that's obviously not the case.

59
00:03:36,686 --> 00:03:39,660
We have a lot of genetic variation
in the world,

60
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,860
and there must be some process

61
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:44,359
that counteracts genetic drift,

62
00:03:44,359 --> 00:03:47,958
and we will meet and study this process
in Chapter 4.

63
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:53,774
But for now, this is one crucial insight
but I'd like to be more specific

64
00:03:53,774 --> 00:03:58,400
and I'd still like to get a better handle
on the speed of this entire process

65
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,471
of the reduction of genetic variation.

66
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:04,490
But now that we have this equation here
expressing the genetic variation

67
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:10,119
at any point in time, in the context
of genetic variation in the beginning

68
00:04:10,119 --> 00:04:12,772
we can ask ourselves
very specific questions

69
00:04:12,772 --> 00:04:17,172
such as, okay, if I start
with a certain genetic variation,

70
00:04:17,172 --> 00:04:19,392
for example, how long
is it going to take

71
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:23,262
until this genetic variation
is reduced by half?

72
00:04:23,262 --> 00:04:26,257
And this is a very common concept
that you may know

73
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:29,832
from chemistry or physics,
this concept of a half-time

74
00:04:29,832 --> 00:04:32,966
of a certain quantity
being reduced by half.

75
00:04:32,966 --> 00:04:36,557
This gives you a good feeling
for how fast a process is.

76
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:40,064
So we can express
this by writing

77
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:45,455
here the genetic initial
variation divided by half

78
00:04:45,455 --> 00:04:49,814
equals the genetic variation
at this point.

79
00:04:49,814 --> 00:04:51,896
So when is this true?

80
00:04:51,896 --> 00:04:56,266
When is the genetic variation
exactly equal to the genetic variation

81
00:04:56,266 --> 00:05:00,136
that we have in the beginning
reduced by half?

82
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,603
So at this point, so now
we need to solve for <i>t</i>

83
00:05:03,603 --> 00:05:07,816
finding out when exactly this happens,

84
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:12,340
when the initial genetic variation
is reduced by 50%.

85
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:14,798
And we can do this, 
first we need to bring in <i>t</i>,

86
00:05:14,798 --> 00:05:17,938
and we can easily do this
because we've already expressed

87
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:23,448
<i>H_t</i> in terms of <i>t</i>, 
mainly by <i>(1 - 1 / (2N))</i>

88
00:05:23,448 --> 00:05:27,728
to the power of <i>t</i> times <i>H_0</i>.

89
00:05:28,278 --> 00:05:30,789
So now we simply need
to solve this equation for <i>t</i>

90
00:05:30,789 --> 00:05:33,470
and then we know
how long it's going to take

91
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:36,439
to reduce the initial
genetic variation by half.

92
00:05:36,739 --> 00:05:38,910
And the first step
that we're going to do here

93
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:42,229
is to simply get rid
of the H zero on both sides,

94
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:46,451
so basically dividing both sides
by <i>H_0</i>, and that means

95
00:05:46,451 --> 00:05:49,448
we'll have to write a 1 here,
and here it means

96
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:51,671
we can get rid of it altogether.

97
00:05:52,211 --> 00:05:54,901
Now I have the t
in the exponent here.

98
00:05:54,901 --> 00:05:56,672
That's never good
if you want to solve

99
00:05:56,672 --> 00:05:58,782
for something that's
in the exponent

100
00:05:58,782 --> 00:06:01,335
so let's bring it down,
and we of course bring it down

101
00:06:01,335 --> 00:06:03,153
by using the logarithm.

102
00:06:03,153 --> 00:06:08,130
So the logarithm of this term
equals the logarithm of this term

103
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:11,523
and now we can bring
the exponent down here

104
00:06:11,523 --> 00:06:13,955
so times t.

105
00:06:14,705 --> 00:06:17,586
Good, so that's a good
intermediary step.

106
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,156
Now we don't have
any exponents anymore.

107
00:06:20,156 --> 00:06:22,458
So how do we solve further for <i>t</i>?

108
00:06:23,188 --> 00:06:27,658
So we can't get much farther here
without using an approximation.

109
00:06:27,658 --> 00:06:30,069
And the approximation
that I want to use here

110
00:06:30,069 --> 00:06:34,596
is the following, namely that
the logarithm of a number

111
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:37,279
that's close to 1...

112
00:06:37,279 --> 00:06:41,792
Okay, so ln (1 + x),
x being some small number

113
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:45,769
is roughly, approximately,
equal to x.

114
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:50,202
And you can easily test this
if you open a calculator

115
00:06:50,202 --> 00:06:52,971
and I'm going to open
the calculator here

116
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:57,260
in the browser, in Google,
and I can now simply

117
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:02,791
you know, for example,
type ln of 1.1 and you can see

118
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:08,542
that this this is 0.09,
so very close to 0.1.

119
00:07:08,542 --> 00:07:13,471
So ln 1.1 equals ln (1 + x),
so x being 0.1

120
00:07:13,471 --> 00:07:15,900
and you can see
this is roughly true.

121
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:19,652
Now actually if I type this again
and I use a slightly smaller x

122
00:07:19,652 --> 00:07:25,412
let's do 1.01,
so x being 0.01,

123
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,924
you can see this is now very close,

124
00:07:28,924 --> 00:07:35,503
and you can test this even further,
<i>ln(1.001)</i>,

125
00:07:37,533 --> 00:07:40,242
this being very close to 0.001.

126
00:07:40,242 --> 00:07:43,854
So this approximation
is really a good approximation,

127
00:07:43,854 --> 00:07:46,607
and it's getting better the smaller x.

128
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:50,074
So I'm going to use
this approximation here

129
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:53,651
where <i>- 1 / (2N)</i> is my <i>x</i> here.

130
00:07:53,651 --> 00:07:55,125
So this term

131
00:07:55,125 --> 00:08:01,915
is approximately equal to <i>- 1 / (2N)</i>.

132
00:08:01,915 --> 00:08:03,915
So I can simply say, okay,

133
00:08:03,915 --> 00:08:12,288
<i>ln(1 / 2)</i> is approximately
<i>- 1 / (2 N) t</i>.

134
00:08:12,858 --> 00:08:15,698
That already looks much simpler.

135
00:08:16,838 --> 00:08:21,810
Now, I can multiply by <i>- 2 N</i>
to get rid of this here

136
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:26,768
and then we get this nice
approximation here

137
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:35,626
which is <i>ln(1 / 2) (- 2 N)</i>

138
00:08:36,526 --> 00:08:38,506
is roughly <i>t</i>.

139
00:08:39,016 --> 00:08:43,291
Now, ln (1/2)

140
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:48,021
equals to - ln (2).

141
00:08:51,271 --> 00:08:55,570
Because, as you may know
from basic math,

142
00:08:55,570 --> 00:09:02,176
<i>ln (1 / x) = - ln (x)</i>.

143
00:09:02,206 --> 00:09:10,991
So <i>ln(1 / 2) = - ln (2) (- 2 N) ≈ </i>t*.

144
00:09:11,255 --> 00:09:14,722
And so we can rewrite
this now by saying,

145
00:09:16,132 --> 00:09:18,705
this is minus times minus is plus,

146
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:24,425
so <i>2 N ln (2) ≈ t</i>.

147
00:09:24,915 --> 00:09:26,954
Now if you calculate what this is,

148
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:33,394
<i>ln (2)</i> is actually roughly 0.7.

149
00:09:34,414 --> 00:09:41,146
And so we have <i>0.7</i> times <i>2 N</i>,
which is of course <i>1.4 N</i>.

150
00:09:41,146 --> 00:09:45,094
So this is roughly <i>1.4 N</i>.

151
00:09:46,064 --> 00:09:49,914
And here now we have the solution,

152
00:09:50,624 --> 00:09:52,805
the approximate solution.

153
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:55,995
<i>t ≈ 1.4 N</i>

154
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:57,964
So what does that mean?

155
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:04,805
Well, it means that it takes
approximately <i>1.4 N</i> generations

156
00:10:04,805 --> 00:10:09,868
for genetic variation to be reduced
by half due to genetic drift.

157
00:10:09,868 --> 00:10:11,028
So if you think about this,

158
00:10:11,028 --> 00:10:14,517
let's say you have a population
of 10,000 individuals,

159
00:10:14,517 --> 00:10:16,997
sort of a medium-size population,

160
00:10:17,587 --> 00:10:24,576
it's going to take 
roughly 14,000 generations

161
00:10:25,466 --> 00:10:28,593
to reduce genetic variation by half.

162
00:10:28,593 --> 00:10:32,827
So, in other words,
for populations of this size

163
00:10:32,827 --> 00:10:37,104
genetic drift is by and large
a slow process.

164
00:10:37,374 --> 00:10:43,133
It's a potent force, but it is,
the reduction itself, is relatively slow.

165
00:10:43,133 --> 00:10:46,398
And of course, if you think 
about an even larger population,

166
00:10:46,398 --> 00:10:49,683
so let's say, <i>N</i> would be one million,

167
00:10:49,683 --> 00:10:51,513
that of course would then simply mean

168
00:10:51,513 --> 00:10:55,963
that it's going to take 
1.4 million generations

169
00:10:55,963 --> 00:10:59,320
to simply reduce
genetic variation by half

170
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:04,386
and then another 1.4 million to, again,
reduce that genetic variation

171
00:11:04,386 --> 00:11:05,977
by half and so on.

172
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:09,527
And vice versa, of course,
if you have very small population sizes

173
00:11:09,527 --> 00:11:12,436
let's say, <i>N = 100</i>,

174
00:11:12,436 --> 00:11:16,986
then this process is, of course, faster,

175
00:11:17,426 --> 00:11:19,618
140 generations, roughly.

176
00:11:19,618 --> 00:11:23,335
So, this is the insight that I wanted 
to generate here in this lecture.

177
00:11:23,335 --> 00:11:26,860
It is that genetic variation 
is a potent force

178
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:29,340
but it's not exactly the fastest,

179
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:33,152
and it depends a little...
well, not a little, but it depends

180
00:11:33,152 --> 00:11:35,870
directly on the population size.

181
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:39,913
So if <i>N</i> is very large,
the population size is very large,

182
00:11:39,913 --> 00:11:42,470
this can be a very, very slow process.

183
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:46,961
And if N is very small,
this can be a relatively fast process,

184
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:51,371
but you can easily calculate this
with this simple formula

185
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:56,321
which is that to reduce genetic variation,
on average you are going to need

186
00:11:56,321 --> 00:11:59,663
roughly <i>1.4 N</i> generations.

187
00:11:59,663 --> 00:12:03,710
So this concludes the short
mathematical excursion.

188
00:12:03,710 --> 00:12:07,921
So we developed three major insights
from very simple, basic principles,

189
00:12:07,921 --> 00:12:12,775
namely that genetic drift acts
to reduce genetic variation, number 1.

190
00:12:12,775 --> 00:12:16,727
Number 2, this process
is going to be stronger

191
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:22,326
if <i>N</i> is small, or vice versa,
it's going to be weaker if <i>N</i> is large,

192
00:12:22,326 --> 00:12:26,877
and we also established
how fast this process is

193
00:12:26,877 --> 00:12:30,216
and we can see here
that it depends on the population size

194
00:12:30,216 --> 00:12:34,546
with roughly this equation,
the time to half the genetic variation

195
00:12:34,546 --> 00:12:38,538
is roughly 1.4 times the population size.

196
00:12:39,308 --> 00:12:43,673
So, in the next video we'll continue
to implement these ideas

197
00:12:43,673 --> 00:12:47,937
and new ideas, actually,
that we'll develop in Javascript code.

198
00:12:47,937 --> 00:12:50,136
So I'll see you in the next lecture.
