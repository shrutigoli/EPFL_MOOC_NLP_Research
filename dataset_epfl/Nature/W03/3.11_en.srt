00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,780
Welcome back Nature, In Code. 
We're in Chapter three, lecture 11.

2
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:12,180
In the previous lectures we implemented 
a JavaScript simulation of genetic drift

3
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,490
and we ran multiple simulations 
at the end

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,360
and we saw that the key outcome 
of genetic drift is that

5
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,991
we lose genetic variation

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,265
and we observed that this process 
seems to happen at a speed

7
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:29,840
that is somehow proportional 
to the population size.

8
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:32,660
It seems to happen very quickly
in a small population

9
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:34,842
and it seems to be slower 
in large populations.

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:39,050
In this video, we want to get a bit of 
a mathematical handle on this process.

11
00:00:39,050 --> 00:00:41,790
Now don't worry if you're not 
extremely strong in math,

12
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:44,770
we'll just use very basic math here,

13
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,780
and you can just follow the reasoning.

14
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:49,660
Probably best to take a pen and paper 
and follow me

15
00:00:49,660 --> 00:00:51,890
and you'll see you'll have 
no problems with it.

16
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:57,220
So we begin by defining a new quantity,
which I'm going to call "G"

17
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,380
and it's a probability that 
two alleles are of the same type.

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:03,400
So say you have your population of alleles,

19
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:05,840
now you pick two, 
are they of the same type,

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,810
are they both A1A1 
or are they both A2A2, and so on.

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,470
Are they of the same type?

22
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,660
If yes,

23
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:16,590
that's exactly the probability 
that two alleles are of the same type.

24
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:19,580
So this could, for example, be 20%

25
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:22,800
and then in 20% of the cases 
you pick two alleles,

26
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,610
they're of the same type.

27
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,830
Now this will change presumably over time,

28
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:30,600
in the case of genetic drift.

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,890
So the question is what happens here?

30
00:01:32,890 --> 00:01:35,300
How does this change over time?

31
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:38,360
So in particular, how do we go 
from <i>G</i> in one generation

32
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,370
to <i>G</i> in the next generation,

33
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,620
which I'm denoting here 
with this dash.

34
00:01:43,620 --> 00:01:46,660
At the moment, 
the way we think about this is

35
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:50,910
that we have this very large gametes pool,

36
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,210
and it's not exactly infinitely sized 
but it's a very, very large

37
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,230
because we said, well,

38
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:58,660
we can't really have <i>N</i> individuals 
producing infinite many gametes

39
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,020
but they're producing 
many many gametes,

40
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,490
so that's the casting effects 
won't matter here.

41
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:07,920
But then when we pick those alleles,
those two <i>N</i> alleles,

42
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,990
then of course the stochastic effect,
a random sampling starts kicking in.

43
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:14,300
We pick <i>2N</i> alleles, 
so that we can build

44
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,860
the next generation of <i>N</i> individuals

45
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:23,010
and those will then again create
a very large gamete pool

46
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:25,370
from which we are going to pick

47
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:30,350
the next generation of <i>2N</i> alleles and so on.

48
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,320
So this is a process,

49
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,260
as we have it at the moment.

50
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,860
Another way to put this is

51
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:39,140
if we think about charge 
that contain our alleles.

52
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:43,260
Okay so we have a jar here--
it's like your marble jar example.

53
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:45,190
We have <i>2N</i> allelges here

54
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:49,230
and we would like to generate 
the generation here

55
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,720
which also has <i>2N</i> alleles.

56
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,260
Now we are randomly picking alleles here,

57
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:58,010
but we obviously have to replace them.

58
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,580
We can't just not replace them

59
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:02,790
otherwise we take <i>2N</i> alleles 
until this is empty

60
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,170
and then we have 
the exact same alleles in here

61
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,490
That's not how it works, right?

62
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,290
How would really works is 
we take a random allele,

63
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,060
we make a copy, put that copy in here,
and put the original allele back.

64
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:19,336
So this is randomly picking 
with replacement

65
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,950
and then we keep doing this,

66
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:25,170
for however many generations we want to.

67
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:29,340
So here we picked again random alleles, 
we make copies, put them here,

68
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,220
and put the original one back.

69
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,970
And so we can always calculate here,

70
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:37,510
what is our <i>G</i> here in this generation,
<i>G</i> in the next generation,

71
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,062
<i>G</i> in the second generation, and so on.

72
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,670
So what is this relationship exactly?
Well, let's think about this.

73
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:50,340
So let's look at this <i>G dash</i> here 
in the first gneration

74
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,857
following the original one.

75
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,410
What will be the probability that 
we actually have two alleles,

76
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,970
if we pick two random alleles 
that are indeed identical,

77
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,165
are of the same type.

78
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,643
So there are two ways that this 
could have happened,

79
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,070
the first way is is very simple.

80
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:16,450
It's basically that you picked 
the same allele in here twice,

81
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:17,440
physically the same allele,

82
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,580
you're actually making 
two copies of the same allele.

83
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,210
So you pick a random allele, 
you make a copy,

84
00:04:23,210 --> 00:04:26,090
you put it back, you pick again randomly,

85
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,290
and you just happen to pick 
the exact same allele again

86
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,560
and you make a copy.

87
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,730
Obviously then there will be
of the same type

88
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,920
'cause you picked the same allele.

89
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:39,150
So the probability of this happening 
is one over <i>2N</i>.

90
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,020
Why?

91
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,410
Well, the first time 
you're just going to pick the allele

92
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:43,453
and then the second time

93
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:47,516
the probability that you pick 
the same allele out of <i>2N</i> alleles

94
00:04:47,946 --> 00:04:49,780
is one over <i>2N</i>.

95
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,128
It's just it's frequency.

96
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,520
So that's one way that this could happen.

97
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,890
Another way that this could happen is 
that you don't pick the same allele twice

98
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:03,420
but you picked two different ones

99
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:06,509
and they just happened to be 
of the same type.

100
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:11,390
How can we express this?

101
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:13,874
Well what is the probability

102
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,950
that we don't pick the exact same allele?

103
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,631
Well it's exactly one minus this probability

104
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,790
'cause either you do pick the same allele twice,

105
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,540
which happens with probability one over <i>2N</i>

106
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:29,610
or you don't, which happens 
when one minus two over <i>N</i>

107
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,848
because those two need to add up to one.

108
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,270
So that's the probability that 
I'm picking two different alleles,

109
00:05:36,270 --> 00:05:38,640
okay, not the same allele here

110
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:42,120
and then I have to multiply this 
by the probability

111
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,531
now that they're actually 
of the same type

112
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,308
and that, if you think about it,
is exactly our definition of <i>G</i> right?

113
00:05:49,630 --> 00:05:53,370
The probability that
two randomly picked alleles

114
00:05:53,370 --> 00:05:54,687
are of the same type.

115
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:58,541
So these are to two ways that 
this can come about.

116
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,730
So I need to add those up.

117
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:04,390
So this is the probability 
that you picked two alleles

118
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,000
and you actually picked twice the same,

119
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,540
which happens would probably one over <i>2N</i>

120
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:14,110
or you don't pick the same 
but they happen to be of the same type.

121
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,980
And so now from this formula

122
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,190
we can easily now develop this intuition

123
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:26,490
about the genetic diversity 
and population size.

124
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:29,380
So we'll start by defining age,

125
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:32,430
which is yet another variable 
but don't worry

126
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:34,080
it's simply one minus <i>G</i>.

127
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,720
Remember <i>G</i> was defined as

128
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,870
the probability that 
two alleles are the same,

129
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,370
two randomly picked alleles.

130
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,180
Now <i>H</i> is the exact opposite.

131
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:42,700
It's that the probability that

132
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,100
two randomly picked alleles 
are not the same.

133
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,170
And if you think about it,

134
00:06:47,170 --> 00:06:50,670
this is a much better 
measure of genetic diversity

135
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:53,200
because if genetic diversity is large,

136
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:56,470
which means you pick two random alleles 
they're likely to be different,

137
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:58,330
than <i>H</i> is going to be large.

138
00:06:58,330 --> 00:07:00,350
And so that's a much better a term.

139
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,170
And correspondingly <i>H dash</i>,
so in the next generation

140
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:07,580
simply one minus <i>G dash</i> <i>G</i> 
in the next generation.

141
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:11,460
And we know <i>G</i> 
because we defined this before.

142
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:18,584
And we know it's one over <i>2N</i> 
plus one minus one over <i>2N</i>

143
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,533
times <i>G</i>.

144
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:22,540
So now we can say, okay,

145
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:25,480
but we actually want to express <i>H dash</i>

146
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,040
so we can simply do this

147
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:31,210
because we know <i>H dash</i> is 
one minus <i>G dash</i>

148
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:33,810
and <i>G dash</i> is this whole here.

149
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,150
So I'm simply going to 
replace this term here

150
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,820
and I'm going to say, 
okay it's one over <i>2N</i>

151
00:07:38,820 --> 00:07:44,110
plus one minus one over <i>2N</i> times <i>G</i>.

152
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,800
And now I can simplify this term, quite a bit.

153
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,960
So the first thing I'm going to do is

154
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,390
I'm actually going 
to get rid of these parentheses

155
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:55,050
and because we had a minus 
in front of these parentheses,

156
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:59,830
I have to change just sign here 
and I have to put a minus here.

157
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:01,680
Good.

158
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,360
The other thing, I'm going to do is 
I'm going to replace this <i>G</i>

159
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,470
with one minus <i>H</i>

160
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:08,800
because <i>H</i> is one minus <i>G</i>, right,

161
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,860
that means <i>G</i> is one minus <i>H</i>

162
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,760
and I want to express everything here 
in terms of <i>H</i>,

163
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,501
and then no more <i>G's</i>.

164
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,351
So I'm going to replace this <i>G</i>
simply with one minus <i>H</i>

165
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,260
and now, let me just create 
the product here

166
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:28,740
so that we have 
all these terms sorted out.

167
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:33,460
So <i>H dash</i> is going to be 
one minus one over <i>2N</i>,

168
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,010
minus--

169
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:38,960
then we have one times one is one--
so minus one.

170
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,419
We have one minus <i>H</i>,

171
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,210
or one times minus <i>H</i>, 
which is minus <i>H</i>

172
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:46,670
but we have a minus here

173
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:52,380
so that results in a plus <i>H</i>,
then we have minus <i>2N</i> times one,

174
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:55,420
which is obviously minus <i>2N</i>--
one over <i>2N</i>

175
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,490
but we have a minus here 
so we need to change as well.

176
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,190
So plus one over <i>2N</i>.

177
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:05,630
And then finally we have 
minus one over <i>2N</i> times minus <i>H</i>,

178
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,240
which is <i>H</i> over <i>2N</i>

179
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,670
but because we have a minus here

180
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,250
we needs to say, minus <i>H</i> over <i>2N</i>.

181
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,820
Good.

182
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,080
So now if you look at this,

183
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,810
we can get rid of a couple of terms here,

184
00:09:17,810 --> 00:09:21,470
because we have one minus one,
so we can get rid of that,

185
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:23,203
one minus one because it's zero.

186
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:30,040
We have minus one over <i>2N</i> 
plus one over <i>2N</i>, which also zero,

187
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:32,130
so we can get rid of that as well.

188
00:09:32,130 --> 00:09:35,344
I can get rid of that here 
and I'm going to get rid of that here

189
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:39,163
and all we're left with is 
this very simple equation

190
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,924
that I'm now going to rewrite.

191
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,880
<i>H dash</i> equals <i>H</i>, okay or plus <i>H</i>,

192
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,544
minus <i>H</i> over <i>2N</i>.

193
00:09:53,470 --> 00:09:55,290
I'm going to factor <i>H</i> out.

194
00:09:55,290 --> 00:10:02,310
So we'll have <i>H</i> times one,
minus one over <i>2N</i>.

195
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,290
Another way to to put this is usually 
what you'll see is that

196
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,820
people will put this one minus one over <i>2N</i>

197
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,990
in front of the <i>H</i>

198
00:10:15,810 --> 00:10:17,860
but obviously doesn't matter.

199
00:10:17,860 --> 00:10:20,210
So this is a key formula.

200
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,550
It's amazing actually 
what kinds of insights

201
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,910
we can get from this formula.

202
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,820
Okay, this is now our end result.

203
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,300
Because look at this formula,

204
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,300
what does it mean?

205
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,880
Here essentially we're saying,

206
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:36,040
okay, what's the genetic diversity 
in the next generation?

207
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,030
Well, it's what it was 
in the previous generation

208
00:10:39,030 --> 00:10:40,889
times this term.

209
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:43,800
And now if you look at this term, right,
it's really interesting

210
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,750
because the first thing that you observe is

211
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:51,740
that no matter how large <i>N</i> is, 
you have one minus something,

212
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,090
something slightly positive.

213
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:59,930
So this number is going to be slightly,
a bit smaller than one

214
00:10:59,930 --> 00:11:01,780
depending on the value of <i>N</i>.

215
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,988
So you already know 
this is a value between zero and one.

216
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:09,170
So here you have it already 
in this very simple formula

217
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:13,030
that it's guaranteed 
that mathematically speaking

218
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:16,048
the genetic diversity will be reduced,

219
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,680
simply because you look at this formula

220
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,185
and you see this number 
is less than one.

221
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:25,150
So by definition <i>H dash</i> 
is going to be smaller

222
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:27,650
than <i>H</i> in this generation.

223
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:31,220
So that's already a profound insight 
from this very simple formula.

224
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:33,070
But wait, there's more,

225
00:11:33,070 --> 00:11:35,180
there is the fact here that

226
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:39,430
you can actually quantify 
this reduction in genetic diversity

227
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:40,930
because you have this term here,

228
00:11:40,930 --> 00:11:44,754
and as you can see this term 
will only depend on end <i>N</i>.

229
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:47,440
If <i>N</i> is very large--

230
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,290
<i>2N</i> is obviously going to be very large,

231
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:52,050
and one over <i>2N</i> is going 
to be a very small number.

232
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,020
So one minus a very small number 
will be very close to one,

233
00:11:56,020 --> 00:12:00,616
so you'll have a very, very 
small reduction genetic diversity.

234
00:12:01,170 --> 00:12:03,556
If <i>N</i> is large,

235
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:09,639
okay, then you'll have-- 
the effects will essentially be weak.

236
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:15,548
Effects of drift are weak 
and we know it now.

237
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:17,630
Why this is the case?

238
00:12:17,630 --> 00:12:21,840
It's because this term will be 
very, very close to one.

239
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:26,628
Vice versa if this <i>N</i>,
the population sizes are very small,

240
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:31,500
then this term will get relatively smaller

241
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,180
and moves away from one over zero.

242
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:37,618
And so, correspondingly the effect 
will be much more dramatic.

243
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,041
So if <i>N</i> is small,

244
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:44,092
then the effects of drift will be strong.

245
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:48,641
So we already knew these two things 
from simulations.

246
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,260
But now we see it here 
in this very simple formula.

247
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:54,480
And I think that's really a strength.

248
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:56,340
If you know how to do both,

249
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,440
then, first of all,

250
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,650
you can confirm one with the other,
which is always helpful.

251
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:05,237
But you can also get much better 
intuition for the whole system.

252
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:11,380
For example, this system can really
very easily express

253
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:16,170
how the effects of genetic drift 
will depend on the population size

254
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,230
and what the effects are in the first place.

255
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,920
On the other hand in the simulations,
the stochastic simulations,

256
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:25,311
you could really see 
how this will actually play out in reality

257
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:31,120
and you saw the stochastic effects 
playing out over thousands of generations

258
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,400
going up and down,

259
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:34,150
and eventually going to fixation.

260
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:36,090
So I think it's really a strength,

261
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:39,820
if you combine computational reasoning 
with mathematical reasoning.

262
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,260
Obviously this entire course is 
about computational reasoning

263
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:48,470
but I occasionally want to bring you 
back to the mathematical reasoning

264
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:51,810
just to show you that if you can do both,

265
00:13:51,810 --> 00:13:54,000
that's really the best of both worlds,

266
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,696
It's not one against the other,
they're strongest if they work together.

267
00:13:59,010 --> 00:13:59,760
And so here,

268
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,829
I just wanted to show you that 
from very simple first principles,

269
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:05,620
you can use this relationship,

270
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:09,100
that immediately shows 
the effect of genetic drift

271
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,920
will be a reduction in genetic variation

272
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,196
and it's going to be stronger 
if the population size is small.

273
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:17,140
Now that's pretty amazing
from such a simple beginning

274
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:19,790
and such a simple formula
but actually turns out

275
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,400
there's another profound insight 
about genetic drift

276
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,280
that you can use from this formula

277
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:26,930
and we'll take a look at that in the next video.

278
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,640
So this concludes this lecture,

279
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,531
a slight excursion into the math of it all.

280
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:33,510
Very simple, but you saw that from first principles,

281
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:36,600
we can very quickly show that 
the effect of genetic drift

282
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,280
is a reduction in genetic variation

283
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,630
and that this crucially depends on 
the population size

284
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:45,760
when the population size is large,
those effects will be weak,

285
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,623
when the population size is small,
those effects will be strong.

286
00:14:48,710 --> 00:14:52,400
In the next lecture, we look 
at yet another profound implication

287
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,720
that this formula has.

288
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,690
So I'll see you there.
