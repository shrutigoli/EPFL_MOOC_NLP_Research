1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,540
Welcome back: Nature, In Code.
We're now in Chapter 3, Lecture 1.

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:08,539
This is the first video of Chapter 3.

3
00:00:08,539 --> 00:00:11,010
In Chapter 3,
we'll learn a couple of things,

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:13,280
first of all we'll learn
about genetic drift,

5
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,630
a really key idea in evolutionary biology.

6
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:17,800
Number 2,

7
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,140
as we learn about genetic drift,
we'll learn about new JavaScript ideas,

8
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:26,280
because we'll be implementing 
a genetic drift, of course,

9
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,390
in JavaScript, in the browser,
and as we do this

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:32,750
we'll come across
new concepts in JavaScript.

11
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:36,250
And then last but not least,
around the middle of Chapter 3

12
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:39,640
we'll learn to visualize data
in the browser,

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,910
and that's quite cool, I think,

14
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,320
because we are now 
outputting our data into the console

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,830
using mostly numbers and strings,
and that's a great capability

16
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:54,250
that we can always look at the raw data,

17
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:57,610
but it's quite important very quickly 
that we have a good way

18
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,270
to visualize the data,

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,762
especially as our models
become more complex,

20
00:01:02,762 --> 00:01:07,631
and JavaScript has
this really fantastic capability

21
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:11,070
of visualizing data in the browser

22
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:14,500
and we'll learn how to do this
around the middle of this chapter.

23
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:15,920
So let's get started.

24
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:19,280
In the Hardy Weinberg world
that we developed

25
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:22,490
in the chapter previously, Chapter 2,

26
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:26,235
the assumption was that we had
an infinite population size.

27
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:32,060
And the reason why we made
that assumption was

28
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:36,230
because it kept things things
relatively easy in terms of the math.

29
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:40,150
Now what we're going to do is
we're going to relax this assumption.

30
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:42,460
We know that this assumption
is actually not realistic:

31
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:44,620
all populations are finite.

32
00:01:44,620 --> 00:01:48,050
So this is what we're going
to assume here in this chapter.

33
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,580
And the population size
is typically denoted

34
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,760
with this capital "N" letter.

35
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,830
Now a finite population size 
can mean many things.

36
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:00,437
We can talk about
only tens of individuals,

37
00:02:00,437 --> 00:02:02,770
or perhaps hundreds of individuals,

38
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:06,160
but we can also talk about
a very, very large population size,

39
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,170
even billions of individuals,

40
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:11,640
or sometimes
even trillions of individuals.

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,080
If you think about, for example,
single-celled organisms,

42
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,710
bacteria, for example,

43
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,050
these can often be--

44
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,870
the population sizes of these species
can often be very, very large.

45
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,680
But even in this case,

46
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,120
occasionally these populations 
will go through so-called bottlenecks,

47
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,410
for various reasons,

48
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:34,830
reasons we'll learn about
throughout this chapter,

49
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:40,550
where their population sizes
shrink down to very small numbers,

50
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,180
but in any case,
the key aspect about this is

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,210
that when you have
a finite population sizes,

52
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:53,010
what's happening is that
chance effects start to play a role,

53
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:57,684
and this is the key effect of this chapter

54
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:02,444
and the principal cause of genetic drift.

55
00:03:02,444 --> 00:03:07,121
And the key intuition that I would like
to develop in this video is

56
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:12,809
that these chance effects
will be stronger in smaller populations.

57
00:03:13,265 --> 00:03:15,590
So when populations are smaller,

58
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,050
these chance effects
will be much stronger.

59
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:24,420
We'll start using a metaphor
of a perfect coin flip.

60
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,912
So what is a perfect coin?

61
00:03:26,912 --> 00:03:30,020
Well, a coin, as you know, has two sides,

62
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,240
often called heads and tails,

63
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:36,280
but you can call them 
whatever you want to,

64
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,240
and a fair coin is one that
when you flip it,

65
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:44,990
each side comes up
with equal probability of exactly 50%.

66
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:46,360
This is a fair coin.

67
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,960
So imagine that you would now
flip such a coin a number of times,

68
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:53,770
say you would flip it 10 times.
So what would happen?

69
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:57,010
Well, and now let's go
through this thought example,

70
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,280
okay, I've got heads and tails here.

71
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,466
So let's say I flip this,
okay, heads comes up.

72
00:04:02,466 --> 00:04:06,206
I flip it again, tails.
Flip it again, heads.

73
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:09,400
Heads, tails, tails, tails.

74
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,178
Heads, heads, tails.

75
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,010
So in this case,

76
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,067
we have a 5:5 ratio.

77
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,998
But of course it could also be,
and on another example,

78
00:04:22,998 --> 00:04:25,180
where I have heads and tails,

79
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,840
I could maybe flip the coin 10 times, 
and I get something like

80
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:31,440
heads, heads, tails, tails,

81
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,666
heads, tails, heads, tails,

82
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,340
tails-- no, sorry undo tails.

83
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:44,010
That's the correct way to do it,
and maybe tails again.

84
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,520
So in this case,

85
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,099
we'd have a 4:6 ratio.

86
00:04:49,099 --> 00:04:51,320
That will also happen quite frequently.

87
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,040
In fact, we could have any type of ratio.

88
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:57,889
We could have 3:7,
we could have 2:8,

89
00:04:57,889 --> 00:05:00,891
even 8:9-- sorry 1:9,

90
00:05:00,891 --> 00:05:04,150
or even 0:10.

91
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,122
This will be very rare,
but it could, in principle happen.

92
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,140
So the question is,
if we do this many, many times,

93
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,018
flipping a fair coin 10 times,

94
00:05:15,018 --> 00:05:18,714
then how often will each
of these scenarios--

95
00:05:18,714 --> 00:05:22,112
and of course the reverse,
as well-- 6: 4, 7:3, 8:2,

96
00:05:22,112 --> 00:05:26,682
9:1, 10:0--
How often will that happen?

97
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:30,150
So that's one of the fundamental 
questions here.

98
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,990
And another question,
of course, is well, okay,

99
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:36,180
what if I do this 10 times,
or rather than 10 times,

100
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:39,222
maybe what if I do this 100 times?

101
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:43,490
So in order to develop those intuitions,

102
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:47,850
I'd actually like to flip fair coins,
and to do that,

103
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:53,460
I'm now going to turn to a website
where we can virtually flip coins.

104
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,793
Alright, here I'm back in the browser.

105
00:05:55,793 --> 00:06:01,440
What I'm going to do is I'm simply
going to search for a random coin flip.

106
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,498
Here, "random coin flip."

107
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,140
Actually, it's kind of neat here,

108
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:09,770
Google already does a coin flip,

109
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,330
and I can just flip it again 
and it comes up heads,

110
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,090
tails and so on,

111
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:19,430
so that's kind of neat,
but what we want to do is

112
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:23,250
we want to do it, you know,
multiple times, not just a single coin,

113
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:27,050
so I'm going to go to this
<i>random.org</i> coin flipper here.

114
00:06:27,050 --> 00:06:30,840
Okay. It's at <i>random.org/coins</i>.

115
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,600
And now I can choose
to flip a coin 10 times.

116
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,100
And I'm going to choose... I'm going
to actually choose the Swiss franc,

117
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,430
simply because I'm in Switzerland 
and it's also a nice coin,

118
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,060
but of course you can choose 
whichever coin you want to here.

119
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:51,100
So I'm going to flip 10 coins here, 
flip coins, and here's what we'll get.

120
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:55,610
So we'll get six heads,

121
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:59,080
and four, well, tails or numbers,
whatever you want to call them.

122
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:03,960
Actually they're called here
obverse and reverse.

123
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:07,030
Doesn't matter-- It's a 6:4 ratio here.

124
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,850
Okay, so let's flip this again.

125
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,804
We have a 4:6 ratio here, a 5:5,

126
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,360
a 6:4,

127
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,360
7:3...

128
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:23,725
So let's just see... 5:5 quite often.

129
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:29,760
Let's see if we get an extreme example
of maybe 2:8 or so.

130
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:32,360
This should occasionally happen--
Here we go.

131
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:36,640
We have 2 heads and 8 numbers.

132
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,210
So I could do this a couple of times.

133
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,152
I would occasionally even get a 1:9,
or even a 0:10.

134
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,434
This happens not very frequently,
but it does happen.

135
00:07:46,434 --> 00:07:48,480
So let's go back now,

136
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:52,640
and let's choose here to flip 100 coins

137
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,726
instead of just 10.

138
00:07:55,726 --> 00:07:58,030
Alright, let's flip 100 coins.

139
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:00,980
So here's the outcome.

140
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:06,190
Now the only downside of this page 
is that you cannot actually see

141
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:09,220
how often heads or tails comes up,

142
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:13,070
but we're programmers,
so we can find a way.

143
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:16,490
We're simply going to right-click here,

144
00:08:16,490 --> 00:08:18,250
and take a look at the page source,

145
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:21,930
and this you can do in any browser,
and we've done this before.

146
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,679
Take a look at the HTML page source here.

147
00:08:24,679 --> 00:08:27,997
And if you look at this,
you scroll down a little bit,

148
00:08:27,997 --> 00:08:33,840
here you actually find all the tags
that render the corresponding image.

149
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,594
So here they're called
<i>obverse.jpg</i> and <i>reverse.jpg</i>.

150
00:08:37,594 --> 00:08:40,540
And I can just search now
in this source code,

151
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:43,390
so I'm going to search using <i>Command + F</i>.

152
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,080
You can do this however you want to.

153
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,780
<i>Command + F</i>,
here <i>reverse.jpg</i>--

154
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,630
Actually, let me search for <i>obverse.jpg</i>,

155
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:59,300
doesn't matter which one, a JPEG.

156
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:02,930
So this image is shown 52 times,

157
00:09:02,930 --> 00:09:06,560
because their random coin algorithm

158
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:11,200
has generated a set of 52 obverse coins.

159
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,930
So that means the reverse one
must show up 48 times.

160
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:21,406
And we can double check this:
<i>reverse.jpg</i>...

161
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:26,114
Indeed 48, because there are
exactly 100 coins, so 48:52.

162
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:31,560
The important observation here
is that this is actually pretty close

163
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,176
in terms of a ratio to the 50:50.

164
00:09:34,176 --> 00:09:36,670
Let's flip those 100 coins again.

165
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:39,610
We actually don't have
to go back into this view,

166
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:42,030
we can actually remain
in the source view,

167
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,190
and simply hit <i>reload</i> here,
and the page gets reloaded.

168
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,320
And now we can search for it again.

169
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,130
Okay.

170
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:53,800
<i>reverse.jpg</i>... 37.
Wow! That's actually quite extreme,

171
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,065
but it's still fairly close;
it's in the 40:60 kind of ratio.

172
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,956
Let's reload it again.

173
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:05,149
Okay, again let's search
for <i>reverse.jpg</i>... 39.

174
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:10,160
Okay that's also close,
that's sort of 40:60.

175
00:10:10,730 --> 00:10:12,830
Let's reload it once more,

176
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,930
and search for <i>reverse.jpg</i>.

177
00:10:16,930 --> 00:10:19,790
And we're at 49-- very close.

178
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:23,844
Actually let's do this just
one more time, just to be sure.

179
00:10:23,844 --> 00:10:27,540
Okay let's search <i>reverse.jpg</i>...52.

180
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:33,160
So most of the time we get values 
extremely close to 50:50.

181
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:37,510
Sometimes now we got something
that was closer to 40:60,

182
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:40,640
but we've never seen a 30:70,
or something like that,

183
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,520
and in fact something like a 20:80

184
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:47,880
would be astronomically
a low improbability.

185
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:50,570
And that's because

186
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:55,919
even though each single coin flip
has a 50:50 chance,

187
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,900
the random effects that you get
from just flipping a few coins

188
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:04,570
can be actually quite extreme,
as we've seen.

189
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,152
I mean it's very easy
to get a 2:8 ratio in 10 coin flips,

190
00:11:08,152 --> 00:11:10,940
but the more often you do this,

191
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:14,750
the closer you get to this 50:50 example,

192
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:19,120
and if you were actually to flip
an infinite number of coins,

193
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,260
you would be exactly at 50:50.

194
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,780
Now, we don't have the time to flip

195
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,860
an infinite number of coins,
unfortunately, and even if we had,

196
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:31,120
that's probably not how
we should spend our infinite time,

197
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,990
but nevertheless, if we were to do this
we would go to exactly 50:50.

198
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:39,100
The take-home message here is
that as you increase this number,

199
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,892
your ratio of heads to tails
will be closer and closer.

200
00:11:43,892 --> 00:11:46,880
The one that you observe
will be closer and closer

201
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:49,680
to the exact 50:50 ratio.

202
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,540
And the fewer coins you flip,

203
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:56,100
the more extreme the outliers can be,

204
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:59,137
and this is something
that we can capture

205
00:11:59,137 --> 00:12:04,020
with a so-called binomial distribution,
because the binomial distribution captures

206
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:08,490
exactly this phenomenon
where you flip a coin,

207
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:13,830
or you have some event
that has two outcomes,

208
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:17,481
two possible outcomes:
yes or no, or heads or tails.

209
00:12:17,481 --> 00:12:21,654
And you can calculate exactly what
this probability distribution looks like,

210
00:12:21,654 --> 00:12:24,620
given the probabilities 
of these two outcomes,

211
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,240
and given the number of events,
so in our case here, the flip coin.

212
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,520
Okay, so you can see
that we can flip a coin

213
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:39,110
a certain number of times, 10 or 100,
or however often we want to.

214
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:44,580
If this coin flip has
exactly two outcomes,

215
00:12:44,580 --> 00:12:46,180
which of course it does have,

216
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,300
then the probability distribution 
is called the binomial distribution,

217
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,350
and this is what
the binomial distribution will look like.

218
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,950
Looks something like this.

219
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,540
So here you basically have the probability

220
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:03,070
or the frequency of this happening.

221
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:07,357
So you know, it doesn't matter
whether that's heads or tails.

222
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:13,023
But the point is, most of the time
it will be a 5:5 ratio.

223
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,797
Quite often as well,
you'll get the 4:6 or the 6:4 ratio,

224
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,060
and then with decreasing probability,

225
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,057
you will get these more extreme ratios

226
00:13:24,057 --> 00:13:27,790
and even to 0:10 and 10:0 are possible.

227
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:32,936
But the point is that we can actually 
now exactly calculate

228
00:13:32,936 --> 00:13:34,566
how often this happens,

229
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:37,630
and this assumption
simply assumes that you do this

230
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:41,900
essentially infinitely many times,
and then you calculate how often

231
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,480
each of these scenarios has occurred.

232
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:46,620
And this is the binomial distribution,

233
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:51,240
and you can precisely calculate
these expected probabilities.

234
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,210
So this is an important concept.

235
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:58,190
So these probabilities here
are the expected probabilities.

236
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:01,800
Now, when you run these experiments
in the real world,

237
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,240
you will not always see
the expected probabilities.

238
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,980
You will typically observe
certain probabilities,

239
00:14:08,980 --> 00:14:13,625
and if you had infinite time,
then you would get very, very close.

240
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,300
Well, in fact, if you had infinite time

241
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:19,030
you would get exactly
to these expected probabilities,

242
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:22,800
but if you had a long,
but still limited time,

243
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,850
you would increasingly
go to these expected probabilities,

244
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:28,270
and what we'll do in the next video,

245
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:35,240
we'll actually calculate
these probabilities in JavaScript,

246
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:39,340
using a method that allows us
to essentially flip a coin,

247
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:41,910
and that's going to be a key element

248
00:14:41,910 --> 00:14:44,630
of most of the course that we'll do here.

249
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,390
You may wonder at the moment,

250
00:14:46,390 --> 00:14:52,090
Hmm, I wonder what flipping a coin 
has to do with biology or genetics,

251
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:55,750
but as you'll find out 
in the next couple of videos,

252
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,850
it actually has a lot to do with it.

253
00:14:57,850 --> 00:14:59,830
So I'll see you in the next video.
