Welcome back <i>Nature, In Code</i>, we are in Chapter 4, Lecture 5.
In this lecture we'll try to get a bit of a mathematical handle on defective mutation.
You may recall, in Chapter 3 we used very simple math to derive an equation that was very simple and beautiful at the same time, because it allowed us to see the effects of drift very clearly.
So in this lecture
I'd like to expand on this a little bit, again, using a very simple math looking at the effect of mutation.
So let's recall the basic observations we've made so far.
Back in Chapter 3 we observed that genetic drift has one major effect, and that is to decrease genetic variation.
That is the major effect of genetic drift: decrease genetic variation.
As we're looking at mutation-- and we've implemented this in the past few lectures-- we can see that its effect is the exact opposite.
It's to increase genetic variation.
So, in other words, these two forces have exactly opposing effects:
Genetic drift acts to decrease genetic variation, mutation, on the other hand, acts to increase genetic variation.
So these two forces are working against each other.
So that's an interesting process that's going on here, and we now are going to see whether we can use simple math to get a handle on this, and to do that, we go back to Chapter 3 where we had this basic observation here with this quantity <i>G'</i> the next generation, which denotes the two randomly picked alleles are of the same type, and we said, that can come about in two ways, namely, we either pick an allele and then pick the exact same allele again and that in a pool of <i>2 N</i> alleles happens with probability <i>1 / (2 N)</i>, or we don't pick the exact same allele twice, which happens with <i>(1 - 1 / (2 N))</i>.
But it just happens to be of the same type, and that is of course exactly what's denoted by <i>G</i> in the first place.
So that is how two randomly picked alleles can be of the same type due to random sampling.
So that's genetic drift, but now we're adding mutation to the mix.
And so for this to be true, something else must happen, or rather must not happen, which is that the alleles must not mutate, otherwise, once they start mutating, they're not of the same type, and we are here excluding the extremely rare possibility that both alleles mutate at the same time and that they mutate to the same type.
This is an extremely rare case, so rare that we can safely ignore it here.
So, what is the probability that none of these two alleles mutates?
We've already seen this quantity here, <i>Î¼</i>, the per allele, per generation mutation rate.
So, in other words, 
<i>Î¼</i> is the probability of an allele mutating per generation.
So the probability that an allele does not mutate from one generation to the next is <i>1 - Î¼</i>, and this is true for each allele, so this probability has to be multiplied with the same probability for the second allele, so the first allele does not mutate and the second allele does not mutate because we called both have to remain the same type in order to be the same type when we pick in the next generation.
And so the combined probability here is simply <i>(1 - Î¼)</i> square.
So <i>(1 - Î¼)</i> square is the probability that none of the allele mutates, and now what we simply have to do is we have to combine these two probabilities here, the first one being that two randomly picked alleles are of the same type simply due to random sampling and here due to the fact that neither of them mutated.
In other words, this equation now becomes <i>(1 - Î¼)</i> squared times this term that we had before, so <i>1 / 2 N + (1 - 1 / 2 N) G</i>.
So, again, this is the probability that you picked two alleles and they are of the same type, given that term in the last generation, given the population size and now--this is new-- given the possibility that they will mutate and they will do so at a rate of <i>Î¼</i> per allele and per generation.
So now this is the equation that we need to simplify, and we're going to start by taking a look at this term here.
So this term here, if expanded, is <i>1 - 2 Î¼ + Î¼</i> square.
And so, can we simplify this a little bit?
Yes, we can, <i>Î¼</i> is a very small number, therefore <i>Î¼</i> squared is an extremely small number, and when it comes to adding up these terms, this one is so small that we can effectively ignore it as an approximation.
So we're going to get rid of this, and we're simply going to work with this term here from now on.
And then we can multiply that with this term here, so <i>1 / (2 N) + G - G / (2 N)</i>.
And now we can expand this fully, so this term times this term, so, it's 1, so it's designed higher term here <i>1 / (2 N) + G - G / (2 N)</i>, and then <i>- 2 Î¼ / (2 N) - 2 Î¼ G</i>, so this term, then times this term.
And then finally, <i>+ 2 Î¼ G / (2 N)</i>,
Now that it is fully expanded, let's see, can we simplify this a bit further again using the same types of approximation?
Are there any terms that will be so small in comparison to the others that we can effectively ignore them,
It turns out, yes, that's true.
If you notice there are two terms here that have <i>Î¼</i>, a very small number in the numerator and N, the comparatively large number in the denominator.
So this fraction here will be very, very small compared to the other terms, so we can ignore those terms that have <i>Î¼</i> in the numerator and <i>N</i> in the denominator.
So there will be this term here, so we can get rid of that, and we would also be able to get rid of this term, which also has <i>Î¼</i> in the numerator and <i>N</i> in the denominator.
And now that's much simpler, and I'm just going to factor out this <i>G</i> here again, so this now reads as
<i>1 / (2 N) + (1 - 1 / (2 N)) G - 2 Î¼ G </i>.
Now you may recall that last time we did start with this <i>G</i> but we were eventually interested in this <i>H = 1 - G</i>, so it's essentially the opposite of this probability.
So, in other word, that's a probability that we picked two alleles and they are of different types, so this is really a measure of the genetic diversity.
So we're now going to do the same thing here again.
So we're going to ask ourselves:
"What is <i>H'</i> going to be?"
Its simply 1 minus this term now here, so this is 1 - 1 / (2 N), now, minus this term here--
I'm simply going to write it:
<i>1 - (1 / (2 / N)) G</i>.
And then, finally, <i>+ 2 Î¼ G</i>.
So there's two things that I want to do and the first thing that I want to do is
I'd like to replace the <i>G-s</i> here as well with <i>1 - H</i>.
Same thing here-- we're going to replace this with <i>1 - H</i>.
And now we're going to fully expand this, this is <i>1 - 1 /( 2 N)</i>
Let's see, here we have 1 times 1, that's <i>- 1</i>, here we have 1 times (- H), so that's <i>(- H )</i>, but we have minus here, so that's <i>+ H</i>.
Here we have <i>- 1 / (2 N)</i> times 1, but, again, we have a minus, so that turns into a plus,
<i>+ 1 / (2 N)</i> , and here we have <i>(- 1 / (2 N)) - H</i>, so that's <i>+ H / (2 N)</i>, but we have a minus here, so that's <i>- H / (2 N)</i>.
And then, finally, here we have <i>+ 2 Î¼ - 2 Î¼ H</i>.
And now here, you can see, a few terms here will fall away.
We have <i>1 - 1</i>, so we can get rid of that <i>1 - 1</i>, because it's zero.
The same thing here, we have <i>+ 1 / 2 N</i> and then <i>- 1 / (2 N)</i>, so we can get rid of the <i>- 1 / (2 N)</i> and the <i>+ 1 / (2 N)</i>.
And so we're left now with this rather simple expression here with four terms, and I'm going to rewrite this here.
And so this is <i>H - H / (2 N) + 2 Î¼ - 2 Î¼ H</i>.
And now let's simplify this one step further.
So we have <i>H' = H - H / (2 N) + 2 Î¼ - 2 Î¼ H</i>.
That's all we just developed, so I'm going to factor out here <i>H</i>.
So that's going to be <i>(1 - 1 / (2 N)) H</i>, and here I'm going to factor out this <i>2 Î¼</i>.
So this is <i>2 Î¼ (1 - H)</i>.
So, that's it,
And now I hope you recognize one element, this term: <i>(1 - 1 / (2 N)) H</i>, this is exactly the equation that we had for genetic drift, and we said this was quite astonishing, because we would essentially from the simple equation realize that this number would always be smaller than 1, so the effect of genetic drift would always be to reduce <i>H</i>, and <i>H</i>, again, a measure for the genetic variation.
So this was the first astonishing simple result, and the second one was that we realized that this depends crucially on the magnitude of <i>N</i>, in the sense that <i>N</i> here is relatively small, then the effect this going to be relatively large, and vice versa.
So this is exactly the effect due to genetic drift, and, correspondingly, this term now here, this <i>+ 2 Î¼ (1 - H)</i>, that is now exactly the effect that's due to mutation, and you can see here, this term, it's going to be a number between 0 and 1, but it's going to be a positive number,
<i>2 Î¼</i> is a small number, but, again, it's going to be a positive number, so positive times positive number is a positive number so, and and we were adding this.
So, in other words, this is exactly what we expected, we are actually adding genetic variation, and here is essentially how much we are adding, and this depends on how much there is and on what the mutation rate is.
If the mutation rate is high, then we get more genetic variation.
And if it's low, then we get less genetic variation, and that also makes intuitive sense.
So this is now really quite a nice way to get a mathematical handle on this.
This is the decrease of genetic variation captured by this term, and this is the increase of genetic variation captured by this term.
So, to wrap this up, genetic drift decreases genetic variation.
This is the quantity-- we've already developed this in Chapter 3, but now we can see, starting from very simple first principles, this is now the quantity that helps us understand that a mutation increases genetic variation, and by how much, depends crucially on the mutation rate.
So, I hope this wasn't too hard to follow.
But I think the fact that one can start from very basic first principles, and then just use a very simple math and arrive at these insights can be quite illuminating and empowering.
And so we've now established both using simple math and JavaScriptt simulations that the key effect of mutation is to increase genetic variation.
So, we're going to leave it at that for now.
In the remaining lectures in this chapter we're going to ask ourselves the question:
We have mutation.
What happens to this first low mutation that comes along in a population?
What is its fate?
And we'll do this, again, using JavaScript simulations.
So, see you on the next lectures.
