00:00:03,350 --> 00:00:06,610
Welcome back <i>Nature, In Code</i>,
we are in Chapter 4, Lecture 5.

2
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:10,010
In this lecture we'll try to get 
a bit of a mathematical handle

3
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,530
on defective mutation.

4
00:00:11,530 --> 00:00:15,960
You may recall, in Chapter 3 
we used very simple math

5
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,670
to derive an equation

6
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:20,400
that was very simple and beautiful 
at the same time,

7
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,160
because it allowed us to see 
the effects of drift very clearly.

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,990
So in this lecture
I'd like to expand on this a little bit,

9
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:30,990
again, using a very simple math

10
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:33,200
looking at the effect of mutation.

11
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:37,190
So let's recall the basic observations
we've made so far.

12
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:39,560
Back in Chapter 3 we observed

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:43,340
that genetic drift has one major effect,

14
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:49,620
and that is to decrease genetic variation.

15
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:52,810
That is the major effect 
of genetic drift:

16
00:00:52,810 --> 00:00:55,920
decrease genetic variation.

17
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,860
As we're looking at mutation--

18
00:01:00,860 --> 00:01:04,590
and we've implemented this 
in the past few lectures--

19
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:08,130
we can see that its effect 
is the exact opposite.

20
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,870
It's to increase genetic variation.

21
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,180
So, in other words,

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:21,880
these two forces 
have exactly opposing effects:

23
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:24,850
Genetic drift acts 
to decrease genetic variation,

24
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,980
mutation, on the other hand, 
acts to increase genetic variation.

25
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,530
So these two forces are working 
against each other.

26
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,480
So that's an interesting process 
that's going on here,

27
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,900
and we now are going to see

28
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,760
whether we can use simple math 
to get a handle on this,

29
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,250
and to do that, we go back to Chapter 3

30
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,260
where we had this basic observation here

31
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:51,420
with this quantity <i>G'</i>
the next generation,

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,200
which denotes 
the two randomly picked alleles

33
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,600
are of the same type,

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:58,870
and we said, that can come about 
in two ways,

35
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,790
namely, we either pick an allele

36
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:05,350
and then pick the exact same allele again

37
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:10,290
and that in a pool of <i>2 N</i> alleles 
happens with probability <i>1 / (2 N)</i>,

38
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:13,950
or we don't pick 
the exact same allele twice,

39
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,590
which happens with <i>(1 - 1 / (2 N))</i>.

40
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,050
But it just happens to be 
of the same type,

41
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:24,990
and that is of course exactly 
what's denoted by <i>G</i> in the first place.

42
00:02:24,990 --> 00:02:27,900
So that is how 
two randomly picked alleles

43
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,630
can be of the same type

44
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:31,540
due to random sampling.

45
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:36,230
So that's genetic drift, 
but now we're adding mutation to the mix.

46
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:37,510
And so for this to be true,

47
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,400
something else must happen,
or rather must not happen,

48
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,210
which is that the alleles must not mutate,

49
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:47,430
otherwise, once they start mutating,
they're not of the same type,

50
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,190
and we are here excluding 
the extremely rare possibility

51
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,930
that both alleles mutate at the same time

52
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,280
and that they mutate to the same type.

53
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:01,160
This is an extremely rare case,
so rare that we can safely ignore it here.

54
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,500
So, what is the probability 
that none of these two alleles mutates?

55
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:10,820
We've already seen this quantity here, <i>μ</i>,

56
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,490
the per allele, per generation 
mutation rate.

57
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,380
So, in other words, 
<i>μ</i> is the probability of an allele

58
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:21,810
mutating per generation.

59
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,500
So the probability that an allele 
does not mutate

60
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,660
from one generation to the next

61
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:31,420
is <i>1 - μ</i>, and this is true 
for each allele,

62
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:37,830
so this probability has to be multiplied 
with the same probability

63
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:39,530
for the second allele,

64
00:03:39,530 --> 00:03:43,050
so the first allele does not mutate 
and the second allele does not mutate

65
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:46,590
because we called both 
have to remain the same type

66
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:51,850
in order to be the same type
when we pick in the next generation.

67
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:57,630
And so the combined probability 
here is simply <i>(1 - μ)</i> square.

68
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,480
So <i>(1 - μ)</i> square is the probability

69
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,820
that none of the allele mutates,

70
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,680
and now what we simply have to do is

71
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,810
we have to combine 
these two probabilities here,

72
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:11,000
the first one being 
that two randomly picked alleles

73
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,360
are of the same type 
simply due to random sampling

74
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,710
and here due to the fact
that neither of them mutated.

75
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:21,320
In other words,

76
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:27,250
this equation now becomes <i>(1 - μ)</i> squared

77
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,060
times this term that we had before,

78
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:37,860
so <i>1 / 2 N + (1 - 1 / 2 N) G</i>.

79
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:42,470
So, again, this is the probability 
that you picked two alleles

80
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:50,650
and they are of the same type,
given that term in the last generation,

81
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:54,350
given the population size 
and now--this is new--

82
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,060
given the possibility 
that they will mutate

83
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:02,530
and they will do so at a rate of <i>μ</i>
per allele and per generation.

84
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,590
So now this is the equation 
that we need to simplify,

85
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:09,420
and we're going to start 
by taking a look at this term here.

86
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:12,470
So this term here, if expanded,

87
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:19,390
is <i>1 - 2 μ + μ</i> square.

88
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:23,710
And so, can we simplify this a little bit?

89
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:26,390
Yes, we can, <i>μ</i> is a very small number,

90
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:29,790
therefore <i>μ</i> squared is an extremely 
small number,

91
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:32,260
and when it comes 
to adding up these terms,

92
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:35,430
this one is so small 
that we can effectively ignore it

93
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:36,750
as an approximation.

94
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,030
So we're going to get rid of this,

95
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:42,180
and we're simply going to work
with this term here from now on.

96
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:45,970
And then we can multiply that 
with this term here,

97
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:55,510
so <i>1 / (2 N) + G - G / (2 N)</i>.

98
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:01,430
And now we can expand this fully,
so this term times this term,

99
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:10,910
so, it's 1, so it's designed higher 
term here <i>1 / (2 N) + G - G / (2 N)</i>,

100
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:19,840
and then <i>- 2 μ / (2 N) - 2 μ G</i>,

101
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,020
so this term, then times this term.

102
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:28,680
And then finally, <i>+ 2 μ G / (2 N)</i>,

103
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:30,300
Now that it is fully expanded,

104
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,820
let's see, can we simplify this 
a bit further again

105
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:36,330
using the same types of approximation?

106
00:06:36,330 --> 00:06:39,720
Are there any terms that will be so small

107
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:44,040
in comparison to the others 
that we can effectively ignore them,

108
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,680
It turns out, yes, that's true.

109
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,780
If you notice there are two terms here

110
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:52,690
that have <i>μ</i>, a very small number 
in the numerator

111
00:06:52,690 --> 00:06:56,030
and N, the comparatively large number 
in the denominator.

112
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,060
So this fraction here 
will be very, very small

113
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:02,640
compared to the other terms,
so we can ignore those terms

114
00:07:02,640 --> 00:07:05,850
that have <i>μ</i> in the numerator 
and <i>N</i> in the denominator.

115
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,420
So there will be this term here,

116
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,520
so we can get rid of that,

117
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:13,290
and we would also be able 
to get rid of this term,

118
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:18,060
which also has <i>μ</i> in the numerator 
and <i>N</i> in the denominator.

119
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,250
And now that's much simpler,

120
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:23,250
and I'm just going 
to factor out this <i>G</i> here

121
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:25,600
again, so this now reads as

122
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:36,560
<i>1 / (2 N) + (1 - 1 / (2 N)) G - 2 μ G </i>.

123
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,560
Now you may recall that last time 
we did start with this <i>G</i>

124
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:46,340
but we were eventually interested 
in this <i>H = 1 - G</i>,

125
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:49,290
so it's essentially the opposite 
of this probability.

126
00:07:49,290 --> 00:07:53,230
So, in other word, that's a probability 
that we picked two alleles

127
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,060
and they are of different types,

128
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,940
so this is really a measure 
of the genetic diversity.

129
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:00,810
So we're now going to do 
the same thing here again.

130
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:02,670
So we're going to ask ourselves:

131
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:04,890
"What is <i>H'</i> going to be?"

132
00:08:04,890 --> 00:08:09,890
Its simply 1 minus this term now here,

133
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:14,820
so this is 1 - 1 / (2 N),

134
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:21,780
now, minus this term here--
I'm simply going to write it:

135
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,490
<i>1 - (1 / (2 / N)) G</i>.

136
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:30,120
And then, finally, <i>+ 2 μ G</i>.

137
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:34,780
So there's two things that I want to do 
and the first thing that I want to do is

138
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,440
I'd like to replace the <i>G-s</i> here as well

139
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,480
with <i>1 - H</i>.

140
00:08:42,770 --> 00:08:44,930
Same thing here--

141
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:48,520
we're going to replace this with <i>1 - H</i>.

142
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,770
And now we're going 
to fully expand this,

143
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,160
this is <i>1 - 1 /( 2 N)</i>

144
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,710
Let's see, here we have 1 times 1, 
that's <i>- 1</i>,

145
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:06,620
here we have 1 times (- H), 
so that's <i>(- H )</i>,

146
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:08,770
but we have minus here, 
so that's <i>+ H</i>.

147
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,270
Here we have <i>- 1 / (2 N)</i> times 1,

148
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,100
but, again, we have a minus,
so that turns into a plus,

149
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:23,440
<i>+ 1 / (2 N)</i> ,
and here we have <i>(- 1 / (2 N)) - H</i>,

150
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:25,530
so that's <i>+ H / (2 N)</i>,

151
00:09:25,530 --> 00:09:29,460
but we have a minus here, 
so that's <i>- H / (2 N)</i>.

152
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:38,300
And then, finally, 
here we have <i>+ 2 μ - 2 μ H</i>.

153
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:43,030
And now here, you can see, 
a few terms here will fall away.

154
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,230
We have <i>1 - 1</i>,

155
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:48,930
so we can get rid 
of that <i>1 - 1</i>, because it's zero.

156
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:55,440
The same thing here, we have <i>+ 1 / 2 N</i>
and then <i>- 1 / (2 N)</i>,

157
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:01,340
so we can get rid of the <i>- 1 / (2 N)</i> 
and the <i>+ 1 / (2 N)</i>.

158
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:09,160
And so we're left now 
with this rather simple expression here

159
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,450
with four terms,
and I'm going to rewrite this here.

160
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:25,720
And so this is <i>H - H / (2 N) + 2 μ - 2 μ H</i>.

161
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,910
And now let's simplify this 
one step further.

162
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:46,420
So we have <i>H' = H - H / (2 N) + 2 μ - 2 μ H</i>.

163
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,160
That's all we just developed, 
so I'm going to factor out here <i>H</i>.

164
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:56,040
So that's going to be <i>(1 - 1 / (2 N)) H</i>,

165
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,130
and here I'm going to factor out this <i>2 μ</i>.

166
00:10:59,130 --> 00:11:04,170
So this is <i>2 μ (1 - H)</i>.

167
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,520
So, that's it,

168
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,750
And now I hope you recognize one element,

169
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:14,700
this term: <i>(1 - 1 / (2 N)) H</i>,

170
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:18,950
this is exactly the equation 
that we had for genetic drift,

171
00:11:18,950 --> 00:11:21,850
and we said this was quite astonishing,

172
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:26,760
because we would essentially 
from the simple equation realize

173
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:30,800
that this number 
would always be smaller than 1,

174
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,290
so the effect of genetic drift 
would always be to reduce <i>H</i>,

175
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,170
and <i>H</i>, again, a measure 
for the genetic variation.

176
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:40,300
So this was 
the first astonishing simple result,

177
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,330
and the second one was that we realized

178
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:47,310
that this depends crucially 
on the magnitude of <i>N</i>,

179
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:50,380
in the sense that <i>N</i> here 
is relatively small,

180
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:53,570
then the effect this going to be 
relatively large, and vice versa.

181
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:58,750
So this is exactly the effect 
due to genetic drift,

182
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:03,320
and, correspondingly, this term now here,

183
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:09,010
this <i>+ 2 μ (1 - H)</i>, 
that is now exactly the effect

184
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:12,300
that's due to mutation,
and you can see here,

185
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:15,740
this term, it's going to be

186
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,970
a number between 0 and 1,
but it's going to be a positive number,

187
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,720
<i>2 μ</i> is a small number,

188
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,910
but, again, it's going to be 
a positive number,

189
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,540
so positive times positive number 
is a positive number

190
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:28,420
so, and and we were adding this.

191
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,000
So, in other words,

192
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,780
this is exactly what we expected,
we are actually adding genetic variation,

193
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:38,510
and here is essentially 
how much we are adding,

194
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:43,400
and this depends on how much there is 
and on what the mutation rate is.

195
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,940
If the mutation rate is high,

196
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,700
then we get more genetic variation.

197
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,450
And if it's low, then we get 
less genetic variation,

198
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:54,200
and that also makes intuitive sense.

199
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,180
So this is now really quite a nice way

200
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:01,120
to get a mathematical handle on this.

201
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:06,140
This is the decrease of genetic variation 
captured by this term,

202
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,500
and this is the increase 
of genetic variation

203
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:12,490
captured by this term.

204
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:16,820
So, to wrap this up, genetic drift 
decreases genetic variation.

205
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,870
This is the quantity--

206
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:21,220
we've already developed this 
in Chapter 3,

207
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,870
but now we can see,

208
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,870
starting from very simple 
first principles,

209
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:30,150
this is now the quantity 
that helps us understand

210
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:34,490
that a mutation 
increases genetic variation,

211
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,430
and by how much, depends crucially 
on the mutation rate.

212
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:42,120
So, I hope this wasn't too hard to follow.

213
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,640
But I think the fact that one can 
start from very basic first principles,

214
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:48,440
and then just use a very simple math

215
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,260
and arrive at these insights

216
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:54,820
can be quite illuminating and empowering.

217
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:56,430
And so we've now established

218
00:13:56,430 --> 00:14:00,740
both using simple math 
and JavaScriptt simulations

219
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:06,450
that the key effect of mutation 
is to increase genetic variation.

220
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,690
So, we're going to leave it 
at that for now.

221
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,860
In the remaining lectures in this chapter

222
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,630
we're going to ask ourselves the question:

223
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,040
We have mutation.

224
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,030
What happens to this first low mutation
that comes along in a population?

225
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,540
What is its fate?

226
00:14:21,210 --> 00:14:24,240
And we'll do this, again,
using JavaScript simulations.

227
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,900
So, see you on the next lectures.
