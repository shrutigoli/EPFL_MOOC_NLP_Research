00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,870
Welcome back to Nature, In code,
we're in chapter 4, lecture 7.

2
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:10,590
This is the last lecture of this 
chapter and in this lecture,

3
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,470
We will modify our existing
Javascript code

4
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:17,510
and what we're interested in,
in this lecture is if a single

5
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:23,890
neutral mutant allele goes to fixation
in the rare event that where this happens.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,240
How long does this take on average?

7
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,520
So here's our code.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,520
We just modified this value previously 
but I'm gonna set this

9
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:38,100
back to one over two times N
because I-- oops.

10
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,450
I want to make sure that the frequency 
is correct from the beginning,

11
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:47,340
In that we have one single a1 allele,
and now we're interested in

12
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:50,130
keeping track of the generations.

13
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,970
And then in particular we're interested
in seeing how many generations

14
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:59,610
it takes in those simulations 
where P does indeed go up

15
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:02,450
to one at the a1 allele goes to fixation.

16
00:01:02,450 --> 00:01:05,400
So what we need to do is we need 
to keep track of the number

17
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,240
of generation, so I'm going to set up a 
local variable here

18
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,500
I'm gonna call generations
and I'm gonna initialise this at zero

19
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:16,910
and then here every time I call this
next generation function.

20
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:20,940
I'm gonna increase this--this value
by one

21
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:25,900
so generations equals
generations plus one.

22
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,190
So this is essentially a counter now,
so in each simulation run.

23
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:34,050
I'm keeping track of the generations,

24
00:01:34,050 --> 00:01:37,920
but what I'm really interested in though 
is really only those times

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,910
and those generations when P does indeed 
go to one,

26
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:44,690
when the a1 allele goes to fixation.

27
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,880
So even though I'm--I'm keeping 
track of this all the time

28
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,050
I ultimately only want to keep track
of the successful simulation runs.

29
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,190
So what I'm gonna do to keep 
track of those is

30
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:59,360
I'm going to define a global variable
where I'm simply going to add up

31
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:05,120
all the generations in those runs
where everyone went to fixation.

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:09,820
So I'm going to go up here
and I'm gonna set up a variable

33
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:15,860
then I'm gonna call total generations
and say total generations.

34
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:19,270
I'm going to initialise this at zero

35
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:22,060
and so now I can say here, 
down here, down here.

36
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:27,600
I know 2 things I know KP has indeed
reached one so the a1 allele

37
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:32,390
has gone to fixation and I also know now
how many generations that took

38
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:35,240
this particular simulation run
because I kept track of it

39
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,530
with this generations variable.

40
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:39,630
So all I need to do now

41
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,190
is basically add this to the total--
total generations variables.

42
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:48,690
I'm gonna say total generations
equals, well, what we already have

43
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,390
in total generations at the moment,

44
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,190
plus generations,

45
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:56,150
plus the number of generations,

46
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:01,260
it just took for this simulation
to reach P equals one

47
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:04,830
and so now at the end of all of this
down here.

48
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,400
This variable total generations
will be the sum of all generations

49
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:17,260
that was spent in only those simulations 
where P that indeed reach one.

50
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:21,260
So how can we now get the average?
Well that's quite simple.

51
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:25,160
So we simply now take this variable,
total generations,

52
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,430
which has all the generations
in a successful fixation runs

53
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:33,530
and then we need simply to divide by
the number of successful fixation runs

54
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:35,000
and how many are those?

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,720
Well, we remember we kept track
of this with this valuable here,

56
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,160
fixation of mutant, that's--
that's the the variable that

57
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,640
acts as a calendar
for the number of simulation runs,

58
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:49,220
where--where the A1 allele
did indeed go to fixation.

59
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,740
So we simply have to divide by
this number.

60
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,690
And now,

61
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,380
we should get the average 
number of generations

62
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:03,320
it takes for a fixation for the a1 allele
to go to fixation.

63
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:07,570
So let's save this and go 
over to the browser.

64
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,980
So here we have our file open,

65
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,710
we can still see you know,

66
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,820
we-- we started,

67
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:17,390
we left off with the P equals 0.2.

68
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,140
And so this was the frequency, the
probability that the a1 allele

69
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:25,940
did go to fixation but we set this 
back to one over two N

70
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:29,480
and now I'm going to reload this
and what I see here

71
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,730
is that the average of generations,

72
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:36,460
it takes for the a1 allele to go
to fixation seems to be something like,

73
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,230
you know,

74
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:40,410
close to 400,
okay let me reload this.

75
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:42,970
Yes, same thing.

76
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:48,490
Yeah, it seems to be hovering around 400,
quite a bit of variation

77
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,130
of course because as you now know,

78
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,230
most of the simulations do actually
not go to fixation

79
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,490
and we only keep track of those
that-- that go to fixation.

80
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,360
So you know what,

81
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,820
let's go back to the code and 
let's increase the number of simulations

82
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:07,420
by something like a factor 10
so I'm going to up this here

83
00:05:07,420 --> 00:05:11,530
from 10,000 to 100,000,
it seems to be fairly fast,

84
00:05:11,530 --> 00:05:14,000
so I should be able to still do this.

85
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,360
So let me reload it here.

86
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,920
Now this is gonna take a little longer,

87
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:26,290
but the result is you know the same,
we're still around 400,

88
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:32,150
we seem to have a little less
variation now around this number

89
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:37,630
but there still seems to be you know,
roughly true

90
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:39,700
and this is now taking some time,

91
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:44,120
and this may take of course
more or less time on your computer.

92
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:48,190
But while this is loading
I want to let you know that indeed

93
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:55,110
the correct-- the mathematically expected
and correct number would be 4N

94
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:57,220
so that is the expected result,

95
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,820
and that's exactly what we observe here,
we have a population of 100 individuals

96
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:04,200
and we can see that a successful

97
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:11,220
fixation from a single copy
of an allele usually takes around

98
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,330
400 generations.

99
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:19,470
So this seems to work, well done 
and this is now

100
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,430
the end of this chapter.

101
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:25,970
So we've seen that the effect
of genetic of mutation

102
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,890
is to increase genetic variation
we got a little bit of a mathematical

103
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,960
handle on this.

104
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,030
And now we have here a simulation
in place, where we can keep track

105
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,070
of the fate of a single allele 
and we observed 2 important things

106
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:41,520
using this code here.

107
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,520
The first was that the probability 
of a fixation

108
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:50,620
of a neutral allele is its frequency
that was the first important

109
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:55,260
observation and now we've confirmed that
if an illegal indeed

110
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:59,840
does go to fixation from a single copy,
starting from a single copy,

111
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,260
the expect the time is 4N,
so this concludes this lecture

112
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,090
and this chapter.

113
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:07,980
Well done,

114
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,950
you've reached the end of Chapter 4,
I hope you now understand

115
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:13,660
the process of mutation
a little bit better.

116
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:16,520
Mutation is an incredibly important force.

117
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,100
It is ultimately the main generator 
of genetic variation

118
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:24,200
and therefore the main generator
of all the diversity we see

119
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,630
in this world and that's quite a stunning 
observation on its own.

120
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:30,870
Now in the next chapter,

121
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,430
we are going to expand our world 
even more

122
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:36,660
and we're going to implement
spacial models.

123
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,490
And this is gonna be a fun chapter

124
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:42,200
because going to be very visual and 
experience has shown that

125
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,050
many learners find this to be one of the,

126
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,970
of the most rewarding chapter.

127
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:47,780
So,

128
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,820
I'll see you there.
