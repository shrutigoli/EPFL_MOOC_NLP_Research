00:00:05,595 --> 00:00:09,151
Hi, I'm Marcel SalathÃ©,
a professor at EPFL,

2
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:12,180
and I'd like to welcome you
to <i>Nature, In Code</i>.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:15,018
<i>Nature, In Code</i> consists
of this online course

4
00:00:15,018 --> 00:00:18,492
and an accompanying website,
natureincode.com

5
00:00:18,492 --> 00:00:20,618
It is also the title of a book
that I wrote

6
00:00:20,618 --> 00:00:23,185
and which forms the basis of this course.

7
00:00:23,185 --> 00:00:26,975
The goal of <i>Nature, In Code</i> 
is to teach you programming.

8
00:00:26,975 --> 00:00:31,085
When I wrote the book <i>Nature, In Code</i>
I had a specific person in mind

9
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:36,714
as a target audience, someone with
A) little or no background in programming

10
00:00:36,714 --> 00:00:39,817
and B) a fascination for nature.

11
00:00:39,817 --> 00:00:44,497
You probably know that programming
is now an essential skill for any career,

12
00:00:44,497 --> 00:00:47,806
but, to be honest, that argument
never resonated with me.

13
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:49,405
It's too abstract.

14
00:00:49,405 --> 00:00:52,859
I wanted to spend my time doing things
I was passionate about.

15
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:54,629
When I was in my early twenties,

16
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:57,103
I was passionate 
about building stuff for the web,

17
00:00:57,103 --> 00:00:58,996
and so I learned programming.

18
00:00:58,996 --> 00:01:01,468
Later I realized 
that I could use programming

19
00:01:01,468 --> 00:01:04,621
to reason about the natural world 
that surrounds us.

20
00:01:04,621 --> 00:01:06,845
It was like I had this super power.

21
00:01:06,845 --> 00:01:08,725
So I decided to write a book

22
00:01:08,725 --> 00:01:12,255
that builds on your motivation 
to understand the basic forces

23
00:01:12,255 --> 00:01:13,969
that shape the world around us,

24
00:01:13,969 --> 00:01:16,481
but that teaches you programming
along the way.

25
00:01:16,841 --> 00:01:20,162
So if that sounds like a good deal,
you've come to the right place.

26
00:01:20,852 --> 00:01:24,061
To get an impression 
about what <i>Nature, In Code</i> is all about,

27
00:01:24,061 --> 00:01:27,942
simply go to the website
www.natureincode.com

28
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:29,405
and browse around.

29
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:33,557
But, I'd like to address two things
very briefly in this video.

30
00:01:33,557 --> 00:01:36,647
First, how is <i>Nature, In Code</i> different

31
00:01:36,647 --> 00:01:39,344
from all the other programming
books and classes?

32
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:44,314
Well, its key difference is that it is
motivated by the natural world.

33
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:48,440
It teaches you fundamentally important
scientific ideas, such as,

34
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:54,256
how evolution works, how diseases spread,
why people cooperate, and some more.

35
00:01:54,256 --> 00:01:58,546
We'll use programming as a tool
to learn about these fascinating ideas.

36
00:01:58,546 --> 00:02:01,213
That's two birds with one stone.

37
00:02:01,213 --> 00:02:05,163
The second point I'd like to make
is my choice of programming language,

38
00:02:05,171 --> 00:02:07,101
which is JavaScript.

39
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:09,500
Why JavaScript?
Well, it's simple.

40
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,625
JavaScript is the language of the web.

41
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:15,649
And since everything,
and I mean, absolutely everything,

42
00:02:15,649 --> 00:02:18,997
is now moving to the web,
being able to code

43
00:02:18,997 --> 00:02:22,373
in the programming language
of the web is essential,

44
00:02:22,373 --> 00:02:24,899
and it'll look great on your CV too.

45
00:02:24,899 --> 00:02:28,197
In addition, JavaScript 
is an easy language to learn.

46
00:02:28,197 --> 00:02:31,194
It also runs in every browser,
which means you'll be able to run

47
00:02:31,194 --> 00:02:36,356
your code, today, on billions of devices,
from smart phones to tablets,

48
00:02:36,356 --> 00:02:40,035
to desktop computers,
without having to install anything.

49
00:02:40,035 --> 00:02:44,187
And last but not least,
JavaScript is blazingly fast.

50
00:02:44,187 --> 00:02:49,037
So give it a shot, get started,
and go as fast or slow as you want to.

51
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:52,229
Good luck on your adventure,
I'll see you around.
