Hi, I'm Marcel SalathÃ©, a professor at EPFL, and I'd like to welcome you to <i>Nature, In Code</i>.
<i>Nature, In Code</i> consists of this online course and an accompanying website, natureincode.com
It is also the title of a book that I wrote and which forms the basis of this course.
The goal of <i>Nature, In Code</i> is to teach you programming.
When I wrote the book <i>Nature, In Code</i>
I had a specific person in mind as a target audience, someone with
A) little or no background in programming and B) a fascination for nature.
You probably know that programming is now an essential skill for any career, but, to be honest, that argument never resonated with me.
It's too abstract.
I wanted to spend my time doing things
I was passionate about.
When I was in my early twenties,
I was passionate about building stuff for the web, and so I learned programming.
Later I realized that I could use programming to reason about the natural world that surrounds us.
It was like I had this super power.
So I decided to write a book that builds on your motivation to understand the basic forces that shape the world around us, but that teaches you programming along the way.
So if that sounds like a good deal, you've come to the right place.
To get an impression about what <i>Nature, In Code</i> is all about, simply go to the website www.natureincode.com and browse around.
But, I'd like to address two things very briefly in this video.
First, how is <i>Nature, In Code</i> different from all the other programming books and classes?
Well, its key difference is that it is motivated by the natural world.
It teaches you fundamentally important scientific ideas, such as, how evolution works, how diseases spread, why people cooperate, and some more.
We'll use programming as a tool to learn about these fascinating ideas.
That's two birds with one stone.
The second point I'd like to make is my choice of programming language, which is JavaScript.
Why JavaScript?
Well, it's simple.
JavaScript is the language of the web.
And since everything, and I mean, absolutely everything, is now moving to the web, being able to code in the programming language of the web is essential, and it'll look great on your CV too.
In addition, JavaScript is an easy language to learn.
It also runs in every browser, which means you'll be able to run your code, today, on billions of devices, from smart phones to tablets, to desktop computers, without having to install anything.
And last but not least,
JavaScript is blazingly fast.
So give it a shot, get started, and go as fast or slow as you want to.
Good luck on your adventure,
I'll see you around.
