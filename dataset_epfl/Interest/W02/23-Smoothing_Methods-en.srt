1
00:00:05,403 --> 00:00:08,502
We saw that exact estimation methods

2
00:00:09,037 --> 00:00:11,149
can lead to ragged forward curves.

3
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:16,227
This is because discount factors
of similar maturity

4
00:00:16,674 --> 00:00:17,987
can be very different.

5
00:00:20,465 --> 00:00:24,190
Moreover, the discount curve
is sensitive

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,235
to small changes in the cash
flow matrix.

7
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:33,361
This may be critical because
market rate data

8
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:35,336
can contain outliers.

9
00:00:37,274 --> 00:00:40,486
If our object of interest is a 
smooth forward curve

10
00:00:41,032 --> 00:00:43,920
we should apply a smoothing 
estimation method.

11
00:00:44,882 --> 00:00:48,332
That is, we should directly
estimate

12
00:00:48,532 --> 00:00:51,069
a smooth forward curve
for market rates

13
00:00:51,648 --> 00:00:55,661
at the cost of possibly not matching
the data exactly.

14
00:00:57,675 --> 00:01:02,075
Let us directly formalize what the 
smoothing estimation method does.

15
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,475
For simplicity of notation,

16
00:01:06,026 --> 00:01:08,926
we set the spot date T-0 equal to 0.

17
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,943
That helps us to avoid
writing 2 time arguments

18
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:17,970
all the time.
We consider market data

19
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:21,099
consisting of N yields

20
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:24,250
which we denote by Y-i

21
00:01:25,155 --> 00:01:28,042
with maturities T-i.

22
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:33,003
The aim is then to find a smooth
forward curve

23
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:38,942
f(T) that matches the yields

24
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:41,186
optimally

25
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:48,693
For pricing errors epsilon which
are subject to be minimized.

26
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:54,365
There are several good reasons
for considering pricing errors.

27
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:59,167
Market micro structure effects
could lead to outliers in the data

28
00:02:00,001 --> 00:02:03,063
and in general, there are
bid-ask spreads

29
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:07,214
which can be wide in 
times of illiquidity

30
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:10,964
so that prices are 
not uniquely given.

31
00:02:11,977 --> 00:02:15,202
smoothing methods are mainly used
buy central banks

32
00:02:15,610 --> 00:02:18,984
and any institution that is 
primarily interested

33
00:02:19,184 --> 00:02:23,009
 in the qualitative shape of the
forward curve.

34
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:26,622
Is it upward sloping?
Is it downward sloping?

35
00:02:26,822 --> 00:02:29,822
Is it steep in the beginning? 
or flat?

36
00:02:30,467 --> 00:02:34,305
The following 3 are key criteria

37
00:02:34,505 --> 00:02:36,242
for smoothing methods.

38
00:02:36,527 --> 00:02:38,327
First is smoothness.

39
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,843
The estimation method should supply
a market expectation

40
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,719
for monetary policy purposes

41
00:02:46,984 --> 00:02:50,971
rather than precisely pricing
all the bonds in the market.

42
00:02:52,081 --> 00:02:53,281
Flexibility.

43
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:57,135
The method should be sufficiently
flexible to capture movements

44
00:02:57,335 --> 00:03:00,335
to capture movements in the
underlying term structure.

45
00:03:01,002 --> 00:03:02,189
And stability.

46
00:03:02,993 --> 00:03:06,605
Small changes in the data at one
maturity

47
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,059
must not have disproportionate
effects 

48
00:03:10,259 --> 00:03:13,259
on forward rates at other maturities.

49
00:03:15,017 --> 00:03:16,929
This is an overview

50
00:03:17,968 --> 00:03:21,906
from the Bank of International
Settlements in 2005.

51
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:26,037
We see that 9 out of 13 central 
banks

52
00:03:26,725 --> 00:03:31,887
use methods called Nelson-Siegel
and Svensson.

53
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:35,791
While the remaining banks use

54
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:38,168
smoothing splines.

55
00:03:38,534 --> 00:03:43,971
We will in the following see
what Nelson-Siegel and Svensson

56
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:46,284
and smoothing splines are.

57
00:03:47,206 --> 00:03:50,268
Let's also look at the third coloumn

58
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:53,175
which indicates

59
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:57,631
what type of error 
is being minimized.

60
00:03:58,383 --> 00:03:59,896
We see that

61
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,980
we can minimize

62
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:04,528
the matching error

63
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:10,354
to yields as we saw on our
former slide.

64
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:11,954
Alternatively

65
00:04:12,956 --> 00:04:16,369
One can also match prices directly

66
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:18,074
and weight

67
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:20,973
the pricing errors

68
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:24,052
and minimize those.

69
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:29,382
The simple smoothing methods consist
of

70
00:04:29,582 --> 00:04:33,020
given parametric families of
forward curves.

71
00:04:35,235 --> 00:04:38,660
The 2 major examples are
the Nelson-Siegel

72
00:04:38,985 --> 00:04:40,485
and the Svensson curves.

73
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:46,438
We see that the Nelson-Siegel curves
are forward curves

74
00:04:47,494 --> 00:04:51,032
of polynomial exponential type

75
00:04:52,059 --> 00:04:53,722
with 4 parameters 

76
00:04:56,212 --> 00:05:00,025
β-0, β-1, β-2 and A

77
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:05,047
where A is the shape parameter
for these exponential functions,

78
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:11,572
and the Betas are linear loadings

79
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:14,863
on these basis functions.

80
00:05:15,063 --> 00:05:19,050
The Svensson family extends the 
Nelson-Siegel family

81
00:05:19,967 --> 00:05:23,167
by adding 2 additional parameters

82
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,469
expressed in this term.

83
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:31,446
And adding thus small flexiblity
to these curve families.

84
00:05:33,514 --> 00:05:37,164
We obtain the yield curves in the
Nelson-Siegel family

85
00:05:37,364 --> 00:05:39,414
by elementary integration

86
00:05:41,738 --> 00:05:43,126
as shown here.

87
00:05:45,817 --> 00:05:50,780
So that the Nelson-Siegel yield
curves linear combinations

88
00:05:51,644 --> 00:05:55,532
with parameters β-0, β-1, β-2

89
00:05:56,035 --> 00:05:57,985
of the basis functions

90
00:05:59,265 --> 00:06:01,902
i-0, i-1, i-2.

91
00:06:02,327 --> 00:06:04,877
The figure on the right hand side

92
00:06:05,616 --> 00:06:09,041
shows us these 3 basis functions
for the choice

93
00:06:09,241 --> 00:06:12,316
of the shape parameter
A = 0.3

94
00:06:13,062 --> 00:06:17,487
and we see that
these basis functions

95
00:06:18,043 --> 00:06:19,343
from MVC.

96
00:06:20,373 --> 00:06:23,660
MVC, that is, 3 basis functions

97
00:06:23,848 --> 00:06:26,373
are the level

98
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:28,109
of the yield curve,

99
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:29,989
the slope

100
00:06:30,806 --> 00:06:32,081
of the yield curve, 

101
00:06:33,012 --> 00:06:36,312
and the curvature of the yield
curve.

102
00:06:37,354 --> 00:06:40,166
We will come back to these 3
basis shapes

103
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:42,041
but from a different angle

104
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,335
in the section on Principal
Component Analysis.

105
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:50,088
The Nelson-Siegel yield curves

106
00:06:50,613 --> 00:06:52,588
are clearly smooth.

107
00:06:53,472 --> 00:06:56,472
The issue with this
family of curves is

108
00:06:57,036 --> 00:06:59,061
their lack of flexibility.

109
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:04,236
There are only 3 or 4 parameters.

110
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,064
But also the stability

111
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:09,040
meaning that

112
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:11,323
changing

113
00:07:12,462 --> 00:07:15,787
a yield data point

114
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:18,556
especially at a longer maturity

115
00:07:19,351 --> 00:07:21,938
will lead to a dramatic change

116
00:07:22,685 --> 00:07:26,510
of the Nelson-Siegel yield curve
at the short end.

117
00:07:27,978 --> 00:07:29,053
Smoothing splines

118
00:07:30,013 --> 00:07:31,075
can overcome

119
00:07:32,215 --> 00:07:34,314
the issues of flexibility 
and stability 

120
00:07:34,514 --> 00:07:37,514
of the Nleson-Siegel 
and Svensson curves.

121
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:42,905
The idea is to find the forward
curve matching the data

122
00:07:43,556 --> 00:07:46,206
in the space of all possible forward
curves.

123
00:07:47,412 --> 00:07:48,612
We formalize this

124
00:07:49,012 --> 00:07:51,812
by fixing a finite time horizon

125
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:53,656
T*

126
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:57,774
and look at the Hilbert space H

127
00:07:59,689 --> 00:08:03,239
consisting of absolutely continuous
functions

128
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:05,541
on this time horizon.

129
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:08,942
And we endow this Hilbert space

130
00:08:09,137 --> 00:08:12,137
with a scalar product as shown
here.

131
00:08:13,813 --> 00:08:16,650
Recall that absolutely continuous
real functions

132
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:21,481
have a first order derivative
which is integrable

133
00:08:23,806 --> 00:08:26,606
so that this integral
is well defined.

134
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:29,615
We then look

135
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:33,425
at all forward curves 
in this Hilbert space

136
00:08:36,164 --> 00:08:38,064
that optimally match

137
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:42,431
the data, the yields Y-i;

138
00:08:43,685 --> 00:08:45,222
and at the same time

139
00:08:48,008 --> 00:08:51,958
are smooth in the sense that

140
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:56,986
the square of the first derivative
integrated 

141
00:08:57,525 --> 00:09:02,013
over the time horizon is being
minimal.

142
00:09:03,051 --> 00:09:04,676
The parameter α

143
00:09:06,136 --> 00:09:07,136
shown here

144
00:09:07,866 --> 00:09:11,566
tunes the trade off between
the smoothness

145
00:09:12,934 --> 00:09:16,097
and the correctness of the fit.

146
00:09:17,144 --> 00:09:21,719
It turns out that this is
a convex optimization problem

147
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,548
in the Hilbert space H

148
00:09:25,506 --> 00:09:27,231
which is infinite dimensional.

149
00:09:29,288 --> 00:09:31,213
The more remarkable it is

150
00:09:32,606 --> 00:09:36,031
that there is a unique solution

151
00:09:36,724 --> 00:09:38,774
which is given in closed form

152
00:09:39,844 --> 00:09:41,107
as shown here.

153
00:09:42,617 --> 00:09:44,142
As a linear combination

154
00:09:45,131 --> 00:09:49,056
of quadratic basis splines H-i

155
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,047
which are defined as piece wise 
2nd order polynomials

156
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,611
with these characteristics.

157
00:10:02,605 --> 00:10:05,017
The right hand side shows

158
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:09,494
quadratic basis splines H-1 and H-2,

159
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:15,881
for the maturities T-1 = 1 and
T-2 = 2.

160
00:10:17,643 --> 00:10:20,455
We see that H-1 is 
2nd order polynomial

161
00:10:22,136 --> 00:10:23,198
with slope

162
00:10:24,469 --> 00:10:26,082
starting at 1

163
00:10:26,996 --> 00:10:29,034
and then linearly decreasing to 0.

164
00:10:29,737 --> 00:10:30,700
And then

165
00:10:33,591 --> 00:10:36,591
as of T-1 being constant.

166
00:10:38,022 --> 00:10:40,085
In red we see

167
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:42,179
the basis spline

168
00:10:42,939 --> 00:10:45,139
for T-2 = 2.

169
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:50,245
The parameters β-0, β-1, up to β-n

170
00:10:50,619 --> 00:10:54,669
solve a linear system which
is shown on the next slide.

171
00:10:56,515 --> 00:11:01,139
Here is the linear system that 
is solved by the N+1 parameters 

172
00:11:01,339 --> 00:11:03,327
β-0 up to β-n.

173
00:11:04,887 --> 00:11:09,025
It can be shown that this linear
system has a unique solution.

174
00:11:10,152 --> 00:11:15,064
This theorem is proved using 
elementary functional analysis.

175
00:11:16,655 --> 00:11:20,005
Proof is provided to you 
in a separate document.

176
00:11:21,453 --> 00:11:27,603
This result is a fork theorem in the
theory of smoothing splines.

177
00:11:29,232 --> 00:11:32,470
I call it Lorimier's theorem 
for this course

178
00:11:32,897 --> 00:11:34,310
because in her thesis

179
00:11:35,006 --> 00:11:37,093
she used this result

180
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:40,562
to estimate the forward curve.

181
00:11:42,303 --> 00:11:46,866
It can be verified that smoothing
splines satisfy the 3 criteria of

182
00:11:47,066 --> 00:11:50,378
smoothness, flexibility, 
and stability.

183
00:11:51,078 --> 00:11:54,553
In fact the parameter α tunes
the trade off between

184
00:11:54,753 --> 00:11:57,066
the smoothness and the correctness
of the fit.

185
00:11:58,405 --> 00:12:00,142
When alpha (α) turns to 0,

186
00:12:00,342 --> 00:12:03,342
in the limit we get the maximally 
smooth forward curve

187
00:12:03,709 --> 00:12:06,034
namely, a constant curve

188
00:12:06,234 --> 00:12:08,509
taking value β-0.

189
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:13,035
On the other hand, when tends
to infinity

190
00:12:13,235 --> 00:12:16,897
we obtain a perfect fit
to the yields

191
00:12:17,097 --> 00:12:20,985
subject to having a minimal
matrix

192
00:12:21,547 --> 00:12:24,185
for the smoothness of the
forward curve.

193
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:28,112
As an example, we see here
on the right hand side

194
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:34,493
the curves we get from applying
this smoothing spline theorem

195
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:39,947
to yield data that we get from
the Swiss Government bond market

196
00:12:40,147 --> 00:12:42,384
in August 2011.

197
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:46,526
In red we see the 8 data points

198
00:12:47,988 --> 00:12:50,263
and then we have 3 curves

199
00:12:50,643 --> 00:12:53,331
for various values of α

200
00:12:53,676 --> 00:12:57,101
ranging from 0.01 to 10.

201
00:12:57,523 --> 00:13:00,410
We see when α is close to 0,

202
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:03,724
we get a curve

203
00:13:03,924 --> 00:13:08,436
which is closer to a constant
than the other 2 curves

204
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:13,526
but it obviously has a bad fit

205
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,288
to the market data.

206
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:17,342
On the other hand

207
00:13:17,754 --> 00:13:21,017
when alpha(α) is large, that is, 
when it is 10

208
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:23,692
we get the dotted curve

209
00:13:24,305 --> 00:13:29,930
which basically, perfectly fits
the yields.

210
00:13:31,588 --> 00:13:35,913
We conclude that the choice 
of α is critical

211
00:13:37,827 --> 00:13:40,827
For a value of α which
is too small

212
00:13:41,483 --> 00:13:43,621
we can get a very smooth curve

213
00:13:43,966 --> 00:13:49,878
which however does a very bad job
in fitting the market data.

214
00:13:50,978 --> 00:13:54,828
The right choice of alpha(α) 
has to be done case by case.
