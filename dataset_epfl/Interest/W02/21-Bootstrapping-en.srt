1
00:00:05,588 --> 00:00:06,663
In this part,

2
00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:09,368
we learn how to estimate 
the term structure

3
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:13,450
from a given set of market quotes
 on instruments including

4
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,038
coupon bonds, LIBOR, forward rates,
and swap rates.

5
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:23,365
We will distinguish between exact
methods

6
00:00:23,565 --> 00:00:25,477
and smoothing methods.

7
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:30,847
Exact methods will give us discount
curves

8
00:00:31,047 --> 00:00:34,897
that exactly reproduce
the market data.

9
00:00:35,615 --> 00:00:39,015
But this comes at the cost of 
somewhat irregular forward curves.

10
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:42,763
If we insist on the regular
forward curves

11
00:00:42,963 --> 00:00:44,775
we use a smoothing method

12
00:00:45,455 --> 00:00:48,567
which gives us
smooth yield curves.

13
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,987
But at the cost of not exactly
matching the market data.

14
00:00:55,355 --> 00:01:00,018
We will eventually see what PCA,
Principal Component Analysis

15
00:01:00,518 --> 00:01:04,155
tells us about the basic shapes
of the yield curve.

16
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:09,922
We now start with
the bootstrapping method,

17
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:12,279
which is an exact method.

18
00:01:13,722 --> 00:01:15,659
It is a very simple method

19
00:01:15,859 --> 00:01:18,972
and it is most used
among trading desks.

20
00:01:20,247 --> 00:01:22,784
The idea is to build up
the term structure

21
00:01:22,984 --> 00:01:25,984
from shorter maturities
to longer maturities.

22
00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:29,064
And it is most instructive

23
00:01:29,264 --> 00:01:32,764
to learn about the Bootstraping
method from an example.

24
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:37,491
We look at this following data
from the U.S market

25
00:01:38,454 --> 00:01:42,004
on October 1st, 2012.

26
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:47,294
We are given LIBOR rates, futures
rates, and swap rates.

27
00:01:49,394 --> 00:01:52,757
The day count convention is actual
by 360.

28
00:01:54,296 --> 00:01:57,896
The aim is to find the discount
curve

29
00:01:58,495 --> 00:02:00,870
for all the reset cash flow dates

30
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,140
 that exactly matches these quotes.

31
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:09,539
Let's look at the first block of 
market data, the LIBOR rates.

32
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:15,911
They're given for overnight, 1 month,
and 3 months maturities.

33
00:02:16,977 --> 00:02:19,239
We denote these maturity dates

34
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:22,439
by S-1, S-2, and S-3.

35
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,733
In terms of the day count convention,

36
00:02:26,394 --> 00:02:29,794
the year fractions are given here.

37
00:02:30,555 --> 00:02:35,942
The corresponding zero coupon bond 
prices are given in this 1 to 1 relation.

38
00:02:38,787 --> 00:02:41,025
The next block contains

39
00:02:41,922 --> 00:02:44,422
quotes on futures prices.

40
00:02:45,913 --> 00:02:50,875
Recall that the futures price for
a maturity date Ti+1

41
00:02:51,075 --> 00:02:56,363
is quoted as:
100 x (1 - the futures rate)

42
00:02:57,722 --> 00:03:01,010
which is the futures rate

43
00:03:01,357 --> 00:03:04,120
for the period with reset date

44
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,432
Ti and maturity date Ti+1.

45
00:03:07,524 --> 00:03:09,436
We have 5 futures prices.

46
00:03:09,993 --> 00:03:13,293
The reset date for 
the first futures is

47
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,977
T-1 is equal to the 
19th of December, 2012.

48
00:03:18,672 --> 00:03:22,897
We use futures rates as proxies
for forward rates

49
00:03:24,447 --> 00:03:25,809
as shown here.

50
00:03:27,282 --> 00:03:29,607
When looking at the maturity
spectrum,

51
00:03:30,407 --> 00:03:33,407
notice that we have a
maturity overlap

52
00:03:34,121 --> 00:03:35,683
as shown here.

53
00:03:35,883 --> 00:03:39,271
The first reset date of the
first futures contract

54
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:42,411
lies between S-2 and S-3

55
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,938
the maturities of the LIBOR rates.

56
00:03:46,824 --> 00:03:49,512
From this, we get

57
00:03:51,784 --> 00:03:54,784
The LIBOR rate for T-1

58
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:57,234
by linearly interpolating

59
00:03:57,915 --> 00:04:01,615
The S-2 LIBOR, and 
the S-3 LIBOR rates.

60
00:04:03,892 --> 00:04:07,980
From the T-1 LIBOR rate, 
we then get the T-1 bond

61
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:12,073
and then we derive the T-2 bond

62
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:15,625
using this formula

63
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,230
which relates forward rates

64
00:04:19,017 --> 00:04:21,979
to ratios of zero coupon bonds.

65
00:04:22,964 --> 00:04:25,889
By iterative usage of this formula,

66
00:04:26,089 --> 00:04:29,852
We eventually get the T-3, T-4, T-5

67
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:33,122
and T-6 zero coupon bond prices.

68
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:38,732
The third block contains swap
rates

69
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:41,117
for 9 different lengths.

70
00:04:41,826 --> 00:04:47,464
These swaps pay annual coupons at
the following 30 dates.

71
00:04:50,763 --> 00:04:53,238
The dates marked in red,

72
00:04:53,578 --> 00:04:56,428
are the dates on which

73
00:04:57,041 --> 00:05:00,316
the 9 swaps mature.

74
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:05,072
For these 9 dates, we are
given swap rates.

75
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:09,332
What we will do next is

76
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:11,993
we will use linear interpolation

77
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,273
to get swap rates for
the black dates

78
00:05:15,473 --> 00:05:19,223
U-6, U-8, U-9, and so on
and so forth.

79
00:05:21,347 --> 00:05:23,947
We will get the swap rate for U-1

80
00:05:24,352 --> 00:05:26,940
as shown on the following page.

81
00:05:28,087 --> 00:05:31,025
Again we note that there is
a maturity overlap

82
00:05:31,733 --> 00:05:35,283
and U-1 falls between T-4 and T-5

83
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:40,023
which are maturity dates
of the futures.

84
00:05:41,529 --> 00:05:45,504
From the futures quotes, we derived
the corresponding

85
00:05:46,450 --> 00:05:48,462
zero coupon bond prices.

86
00:05:49,944 --> 00:05:54,069
So we are given the T-4 bond
and the T-5 bond prices.

87
00:05:55,177 --> 00:06:00,827
From these, we infer the T-4 and the
T-5 simple spot rates

88
00:06:01,324 --> 00:06:03,511
and then we use linear interpolation

89
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:06,632
of these 2 simple spot rates

90
00:06:07,236 --> 00:06:10,648
to get the simple spot rate
with maturity U-1.

91
00:06:12,721 --> 00:06:16,084
The simple spot rate with
maturity U-1

92
00:06:16,904 --> 00:06:19,979
gives us the U-1 bond price,

93
00:06:20,179 --> 00:06:23,504
and then we can use the swap rate
formula

94
00:06:23,987 --> 00:06:28,887
which relates the swap rate
for maturity U-2

95
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,367
to the U-1 and U-2 bond prices.

96
00:06:34,376 --> 00:06:37,151
We can solve this equation

97
00:06:37,483 --> 00:06:40,358
for the U-2 bond price
as shown here.

98
00:06:42,033 --> 00:06:44,758
For the remaining cash flow dates

99
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:48,715
we use linear interpolation

100
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:53,100
to obtain the corresponding
swap rates.

101
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:58,685
We can then invert the swap rate
formula

102
00:06:59,630 --> 00:07:04,517
to derive iteratively the U-n
bond price

103
00:07:06,837 --> 00:07:10,762
in terms of the previous bond prices

104
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:16,890
and the corresponding swap rates
as shown here.

105
00:07:18,761 --> 00:07:22,586
We eventually obtain the U-n bond
prices

106
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,459
for all the remaining maturities

107
00:07:26,272 --> 00:07:28,984
n from 3 to 30.

108
00:07:30,466 --> 00:07:34,191
Setting the initial value of the 
discount curve equal to 1

109
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:38,900
we thus have constructed
the discount curve

110
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:42,689
for 40 maturity time points

111
00:07:43,027 --> 00:07:45,127
as shown here.

112
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:49,829
Recall that the blue maturities

113
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,029
S-1, S-2, S-3

114
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:55,481
correspond to the LIBOR rates.

115
00:07:56,412 --> 00:07:59,674
The red maturities T-1 up to T-6

116
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:02,978
correspond to the futures rate,

117
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:07,064
and the green maturities U-1
up to U-30

118
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,238
correspond to the swap rates.

119
00:08:11,493 --> 00:08:15,656
We also see again the overlap
of these maturity spectra.

120
00:08:17,312 --> 00:08:20,499
The T maturities overlap
with the S maturities

121
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:25,619
and the green swap maturities 
overlap

122
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:28,894
with the red T maturities.

123
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:34,123
The figure on the left hand side
shows us the discount curve

124
00:08:35,193 --> 00:08:37,755
as a function of time to maturity.

125
00:08:38,633 --> 00:08:41,583
We see that the bulk of 
the maturity dates

126
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:46,384
correspond to the swap contracts.

127
00:08:47,889 --> 00:08:50,477
If we zoom in to the first 3 years

128
00:08:50,968 --> 00:08:53,006
this is what we see on
the right hand side.

129
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,296
We see the short end
of the discount curve.

130
00:08:56,937 --> 00:09:00,199
So here we can nicely distinguish
between

131
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,124
the LIBOR maturity dates, the futures
reset and maturity dates,

132
00:09:05,682 --> 00:09:09,957
and then the first cash flow dates
of the swap contracts.

133
00:09:12,335 --> 00:09:15,960
The figure on the left hand side
shows 3 curves.

134
00:09:16,692 --> 00:09:19,392
The first curve is the yield curve,

135
00:09:19,953 --> 00:09:22,228
that corresponds to the discount
curve.

136
00:09:23,341 --> 00:09:26,353
The second curve is

137
00:09:27,748 --> 00:09:31,161
the curve of simple spot rates

138
00:09:31,944 --> 00:09:35,832
both of which look decently smooth.

139
00:09:37,145 --> 00:09:39,507
But if we look at the forward curve,

140
00:09:41,465 --> 00:09:43,327
this is the middle curve here,

141
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,085
we see some saw tooth.

142
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,837
If we again zoom in to the first
3 years,

143
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,347
this is what is shown on
the right hand side,

144
00:09:57,195 --> 00:10:00,358
we see irregularities also showing
up here.

145
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:04,681
So in sum

146
00:10:05,641 --> 00:10:08,466
the bootstrapping gives us

147
00:10:08,986 --> 00:10:10,673
an entire term structure

148
00:10:11,366 --> 00:10:13,766
from relatively few instruments.

149
00:10:13,966 --> 00:10:16,853
We had 3 LIBOR, 
5 futures contracts,

150
00:10:17,053 --> 00:10:19,691
and 9 swap contracts.

151
00:10:20,732 --> 00:10:24,632
The method exactly reconstructs
these market prices

152
00:10:25,647 --> 00:10:28,797
and this is desirable for interest
rate risk management

153
00:10:28,997 --> 00:10:29,997
and trading desks

154
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:33,480
because they have to marked
to market their books.

155
00:10:34,183 --> 00:10:37,570
But the implied forward curve
is irregular

156
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,578
and sensitive to bond price
variations.

157
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:45,012
Bootstrapping is an example

158
00:10:45,564 --> 00:10:47,952
of an exact estimation method.
