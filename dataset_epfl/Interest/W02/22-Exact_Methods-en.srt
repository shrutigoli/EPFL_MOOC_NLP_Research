1
00:00:05,329 --> 00:00:08,979
We saw bootstrapping as an
example of an exact method.

2
00:00:09,966 --> 00:00:13,729
In this part, we will now
formalize the exact method

3
00:00:14,188 --> 00:00:17,675
and see how it can be written
as a linear equation.

4
00:00:18,641 --> 00:00:24,066
We will highlight some issues, and
propose some solutions to these issues.

5
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:27,403
One solution as we will see
is the bootstrapping method.

6
00:00:28,576 --> 00:00:33,001
I will also show you another
alternative solution to it which

7
00:00:33,289 --> 00:00:36,314
which builds on the pseudo-inverse
of the cash flow matrix.

8
00:00:37,727 --> 00:00:42,439
Formally speaking, the market data
that is given to us

9
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:44,339
at the spot date t-0

10
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:50,923
is stacked into a vector P of 
n market prices.

11
00:00:52,341 --> 00:00:55,741
Each of these instruments yields
a cashflow

12
00:00:56,364 --> 00:00:57,789
c-ij

13
00:00:59,906 --> 00:01:02,056
so that the value of instrument i

14
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:07,127
is given as the sum of the 
discounted cash flows c-ij.

15
00:01:09,832 --> 00:01:12,957
Now the special thing about this sum
is that we will

16
00:01:13,398 --> 00:01:16,786
sum up all possible cash flow dates,

17
00:01:18,456 --> 00:01:20,019
and there are N of them,

18
00:01:20,546 --> 00:01:23,946
even though instrument i may not
have a cash flow at that date.

19
00:01:25,184 --> 00:01:28,209
We will then simply put c-ij = 0.

20
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:34,251
So the market gives us the 'P-i's

21
00:01:34,451 --> 00:01:36,689
and it gives us the 'c-ij's

22
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:41,003
the cash flows on the date t-j.

23
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:45,762
What is not known is 
the discount curve.

24
00:01:46,174 --> 00:01:49,687
We stack the discount curve
into the vector D

25
00:01:51,156 --> 00:01:54,369
and we rewrite this equation
here

26
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:58,326
as this matrix equation.

27
00:01:59,615 --> 00:02:02,840
The next step is now 
to bring the data

28
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,827
into this form.

29
00:02:05,785 --> 00:02:08,135
While this is pretty 
straightforward

30
00:02:08,335 --> 00:02:11,985
if the market data describes prices
of coupon bearing bonds,

31
00:02:12,984 --> 00:02:16,209
this is less so in cases where 
market data

32
00:02:16,409 --> 00:02:20,083
represents LIBOR, forward rates, 
and swap rates.

33
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,030
Let's start with coupon bond
market data.

34
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,590
As an example, we look at these
quotes

35
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:34,823
of UK government bonds

36
00:02:35,494 --> 00:02:38,894
on the 4th of September, 1996.

37
00:02:40,007 --> 00:02:44,745
We have 9 bonds, and they come
with coupons

38
00:02:45,282 --> 00:02:49,757
ranging from 7% to 12.25%

39
00:02:50,449 --> 00:02:53,737
on a principal of 100.

40
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:58,312
We see in the middle columns,
the next coupon dates.

41
00:02:59,036 --> 00:03:02,486
And we see in this column here
the maturity dates

42
00:03:02,686 --> 00:03:05,023
of the corresponding bonds.

43
00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:07,964
We also see the dirty prices.

44
00:03:08,815 --> 00:03:13,965
So if we start to count
and order the cash flow dates,

45
00:03:15,306 --> 00:03:17,756
we see that it's bond 3

46
00:03:17,956 --> 00:03:20,343
that pays the next coupon.

47
00:03:21,004 --> 00:03:23,017
The next bond is bond 9.

48
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:30,233
And the third cash flow 
comes from bond 5.

49
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:37,612
We also see from that table
that bond 1

50
00:03:38,717 --> 00:03:41,117
is the soonest to mature bond.

51
00:03:42,604 --> 00:03:47,029
The next coupon date coincides 
with it's maturity date.

52
00:03:47,413 --> 00:03:51,113
So there is only one cash flow
left for this bond.

53
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:55,907
UK government bonds have
semi-annual cash flows.

54
00:03:56,242 --> 00:04:00,992
So bond 2 has 3 cash flows left

55
00:04:02,684 --> 00:04:04,484
and so on and so forth.

56
00:04:06,013 --> 00:04:10,801
If we summarize this UK government
bonds data

57
00:04:11,586 --> 00:04:14,586
on the 4th of September, 1996,

58
00:04:14,985 --> 00:04:17,560
our prices of coupon bearing bonds

59
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,673
that pay semi-annual coupons.

60
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:24,566
The day count convention is 
actual over 365.

61
00:04:25,693 --> 00:04:29,268
The number of market prices given R
is 9

62
00:04:29,468 --> 00:04:32,468
and the number of cash flow dates

63
00:04:33,014 --> 00:04:36,739
if we sum them up, bond 1 had
1 cash flow left

64
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:39,269
bond 2 had 3 cash flows left

65
00:04:39,469 --> 00:04:40,881
and so on and so forth;

66
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:45,072
summing up gives us 
104 cash flow dates.

67
00:04:45,683 --> 00:04:50,008
The first one is 
the one from bond 3.

68
00:04:50,347 --> 00:04:54,210
The second one is 
the one from bond 9

69
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,410
and the third one is the one
from bond 5

70
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:00,024
as seen on the previous slide.

71
00:05:01,238 --> 00:05:04,726
We can summarize these cash flows
into the matrix C.

72
00:05:06,197 --> 00:05:10,559
In the first row, we see the
 cash flow of bond 1

73
00:05:11,405 --> 00:05:16,042
which matures and pays 
the principal plus

74
00:05:16,242 --> 00:05:18,805
the 10% coupon rate.

75
00:05:19,005 --> 00:05:22,630
Remember that coupons are paid
semi-annually,

76
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:29,155
rates are annualized so the interest
paid on the maturity date is 5.

77
00:05:30,191 --> 00:05:36,116
Similarly the 2nd bond will pay
a coupon of 4.875

78
00:05:37,075 --> 00:05:39,663
The third bond, which is the bond
with

79
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:47,275
the earliest next coupon payment
pays 6.125

80
00:05:48,029 --> 00:05:49,554
and so on and so forth.

81
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:55,031
Recall that in total we have
104 cash flow dates.

82
00:05:56,007 --> 00:05:59,970
So what we see on this slide are
the first 10 columns 

83
00:06:00,526 --> 00:06:05,426
of a 9 x 104 cash flow matrix.

84
00:06:07,299 --> 00:06:11,999
We also see that it is sparse,
that is, most of the entries are 0.

85
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,840
Now let us bring into the price
cash flow form

86
00:06:29,641 --> 00:06:31,978
the LIBOR and forward rates.

87
00:06:33,161 --> 00:06:36,961
The LIBOR rate prevailing
at t-0

88
00:06:37,161 --> 00:06:39,611
with maturity date T

89
00:06:40,672 --> 00:06:45,172
can be cast in the form, by giving
it a price

90
00:06:46,314 --> 00:06:49,314
P of 1 at t-0.

91
00:06:49,514 --> 00:06:52,102
And giving it a cash flow

92
00:06:52,797 --> 00:06:57,859
of 1 + ( δ x the rate(L) ) 

93
00:06:58,059 --> 00:07:00,147
at maturity T.

94
00:07:02,148 --> 00:07:06,161
A forward rate, remember, was derived
from a forward rate agreement

95
00:07:07,512 --> 00:07:12,325
which corresponds to 
a cash flow of -1

96
00:07:13,020 --> 00:07:17,820
at time T-1and cash flow

97
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:23,595
of 1 + ( δ x the forward rate(F) )
at T-2.

98
00:07:25,382 --> 00:07:28,382
The present value of these 
cash flows

99
00:07:28,582 --> 00:07:31,582
at time t-0 is 0.

100
00:07:34,744 --> 00:07:39,444
This carries over to swap contracts
as follows.

101
00:07:40,610 --> 00:07:43,047
Let the fixed rate be K

102
00:07:43,609 --> 00:07:48,896
and let t-0 up to T-n denote
the reset and settlement dates.

103
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:53,290
Where for the sake of notation,
we assume

104
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:55,915
that the delta(δ) here is constant.

105
00:07:56,673 --> 00:08:00,285
If K is the swap rate

106
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:01,677
then

107
00:08:02,688 --> 00:08:05,301
this relation here holds.

108
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,013
So if the swap is spot starting

109
00:08:12,188 --> 00:08:15,575
if T-0 = t-0

110
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:22,024
this is just value 1, we take
it to the left hand side

111
00:08:22,918 --> 00:08:26,368
and we see that we get a price
cash flow

112
00:08:27,233 --> 00:08:33,071
scheme of price (p) = 1, 
cash flows = δ.K

113
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:36,932
and 1 + ( δ.K ) at maturity.

114
00:08:38,088 --> 00:08:40,588
If the swap is forward starting,

115
00:08:42,700 --> 00:08:45,738
we take this equation literally
as is

116
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:50,833
the price is 0, of a cash flow of -1

117
00:08:51,033 --> 00:08:56,108
at time T-0 plus 
cash flows of (δ.K)

118
00:08:56,495 --> 00:09:00,983
at times T-j and 1 + (δ.K)
at times T-n.

119
00:09:02,564 --> 00:09:05,564
Summarizing these formalizations

120
00:09:05,988 --> 00:09:07,763
at the spot date t-0,

121
00:09:08,239 --> 00:09:13,476
LIBOR and spot starting swaps
have a notional price of 1.

122
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:19,249
Forward rate agreements and forward
starting swaps have a notional price of 0.

123
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:23,133
Let us now come back to the example

124
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:28,245
with the US money and swap
market data

125
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:31,445
from 1st of October, 2012

126
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:35,045
that is the example we saw on
the bootstrapping example.

127
00:09:36,332 --> 00:09:40,070
Remember the day count 
convention is actual over 360.

128
00:09:40,917 --> 00:09:46,567
We are given 3 LIBOR rates, 
5 futures quotes,

129
00:09:46,767 --> 00:09:49,129
and 9 swap rates.

130
00:09:50,556 --> 00:09:53,681
We thus have 17 market prices.

131
00:09:55,379 --> 00:10:00,141
The corresponding cash flows are
3 for the LIBOR, 6 for the futures

132
00:10:00,795 --> 00:10:02,483
and 30 for the swaps

133
00:10:02,996 --> 00:10:05,059
adding up to 39.

134
00:10:05,306 --> 00:10:09,956
The ordered cash flow dates are,
t-1 is the 2nd of October

135
00:10:10,468 --> 00:10:13,343
which is the overnight LIBOR 
maturity.

136
00:10:14,073 --> 00:10:17,973
t-2 is the 5th of November which
is the 1 month LIBOR.

137
00:10:18,812 --> 00:10:23,974
t-3 is the 19th of December which
is the first reset date

138
00:10:24,174 --> 00:10:28,449
of the first futures contract here,
and so on and so forth.

139
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:37,676
If we stack these cash flows into
the 17 x 39 cash flow matrix C

140
00:10:38,376 --> 00:10:40,439
it will look like this.

141
00:10:41,694 --> 00:10:45,231
In the first row, we have the cash 
flow of the overnight LIBOR.

142
00:10:45,431 --> 00:10:48,769
Second row, we see the cash flow
of the one month LIBOR.

143
00:10:48,969 --> 00:10:52,469
In the third row, we have the cash
flow of the 3 month LIBOR.

144
00:10:54,467 --> 00:10:57,704
In the fourth row here, we see the
cash flow -1

145
00:10:57,892 --> 00:11:00,792
which is from the first
futures contract

146
00:11:00,992 --> 00:11:06,454
and the cash flow of the corresponding
 cash flow at the maturity.

147
00:11:08,197 --> 00:11:13,010
Similarly for the remaining futures
contract in this middle of the matrix

148
00:11:14,986 --> 00:11:18,873
and then in this first row
corresponding to the swap contracts

149
00:11:19,073 --> 00:11:25,973
we have the 2 year swap which pays
2 annual coupons

150
00:11:27,036 --> 00:11:28,211
as shown here.

151
00:11:29,225 --> 00:11:33,125
The next swap has a length of 
3 years

152
00:11:33,312 --> 00:11:36,537
and it pays 3 coupons

153
00:11:39,471 --> 00:11:41,384
and so on and so forth.

154
00:11:42,452 --> 00:11:46,914
Again what we see here
is not the full matrix, we just see

155
00:11:47,985 --> 00:11:52,935
the first 12 columns, in fact,
of 39 in total.

156
00:11:54,150 --> 00:11:57,963
Again we see that the matrix
is full of zeros

157
00:11:58,565 --> 00:12:00,278
and is sparse.

158
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:08,425
On the other hand, it is also
obvious that this matrix has

159
00:12:08,625 --> 00:12:12,962
full rank; the 17 rows
linearly independent.

160
00:12:13,977 --> 00:12:16,915
The linear system for the discount
curve

161
00:12:17,115 --> 00:12:22,215
hence has at least a solution,
it has in fact infinitely many.

162
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:27,941
Summarizing these exact methods

163
00:12:28,141 --> 00:12:32,391
typically leads to linear systems

164
00:12:34,002 --> 00:12:36,752
for the discount curve D.

165
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:42,408
Which are under determined because
the number of equations

166
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:49,996
n is much smaller than 
the number of unknowns(N) in general.

167
00:12:51,298 --> 00:12:56,010
As a consequence, there exist
many discount curve solutions.

168
00:12:56,468 --> 00:12:58,155
from which one is to choose.

169
00:12:59,448 --> 00:13:03,635
Now let's recall the bootstrapping
example

170
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:05,824
from the previous section.

171
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:10,101
A moment's reflection shows that

172
00:13:10,407 --> 00:13:15,032
we in fact synthetically created new
market instruments

173
00:13:15,232 --> 00:13:19,382
by the linear interpolation of swap
rates and LIBOR rates.

174
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:25,588
We actually created just as many new
market instuments

175
00:13:25,788 --> 00:13:28,788
as there are equations missing.

176
00:13:29,315 --> 00:13:31,928
N-n

177
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:36,925
The extended market data then

178
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:41,262
gave us N X N cash flow matrix

179
00:13:41,618 --> 00:13:43,381
that was invertible.

180
00:13:43,946 --> 00:13:48,996
And so we could solve for the unique
discount curve in that case.

181
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:54,051
Bootstrapping is one possibility
to deal

182
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,295
with the issue of an under
determined linear system.

183
00:13:57,941 --> 00:14:01,141
As an alternative solution, 
we will now see 

184
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,929
what the pseudo-inverse of the
cash flow matrix

185
00:14:04,284 --> 00:14:06,109
can tell us.

186
00:14:07,938 --> 00:14:09,875
Here is the idea.

187
00:14:10,075 --> 00:14:14,200
Instead of estimating the discount
function D directly,

188
00:14:14,621 --> 00:14:19,483
we estimate instead, a vector
of weighted increments

189
00:14:19,683 --> 00:14:23,308
of the discount curve
as shown here.

190
00:14:25,428 --> 00:14:29,278
The first entry is the t-1 bond 
price minus 1

191
00:14:29,478 --> 00:14:31,403
which is the t-0 bond price

192
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:36,575
divided by the square root of the 
time to maturity.

193
00:14:37,876 --> 00:14:42,701
The second entry is the difference
between the t-2 bond, and the t-1 bond

194
00:14:43,074 --> 00:14:48,037
divided by the square root of the 
difference of their maturities

195
00:14:48,395 --> 00:14:50,145
and so on and so forth

196
00:14:50,976 --> 00:14:55,026
to the t-n bond price minus the
t-(n-1) bond price

197
00:14:55,476 --> 00:14:57,401
again weighted.

198
00:14:58,251 --> 00:15:02,976
We can write this in matrix form
as product of a weighting matrix W

199
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:09,625
multiplying M applied to d 
minus the first basis vector.

200
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:12,917
The weighting matrix W is the
diagonal matrix

201
00:15:13,117 --> 00:15:15,442
with these entries on
the diagonal

202
00:15:16,189 --> 00:15:19,414
and M is this matrix as shown here.

203
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:23,365
There is in fact a 1-1 relation
between

204
00:15:24,106 --> 00:15:27,131
this vector of weighted increments δ

205
00:15:27,494 --> 00:15:30,344
and the original discount curve d

206
00:15:31,187 --> 00:15:32,574
as shown here.

207
00:15:33,870 --> 00:15:39,070
Where the inverse of M can be
explicitly computed as shown here.

208
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:44,412
We can thus reformulate
and restate 

209
00:15:45,324 --> 00:15:47,562
the linear matching problem

210
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:54,991
as this linear system here
which is now an equation

211
00:15:55,191 --> 00:15:56,916
for the vector δ.

212
00:15:57,414 --> 00:16:01,677
Remember that market data gives
us the cash flow matrix C,

213
00:16:02,974 --> 00:16:06,261
M is an auxiliary explicitly
given matrix,

214
00:16:06,461 --> 00:16:11,949
W is the diagonal matrix consisting
of the weights

215
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:15,724
derived from the maturity dates.

216
00:16:17,207 --> 00:16:20,557
P is the vector of market prices.

217
00:16:21,955 --> 00:16:27,218
Again, these are more unknowns than
there are equations.

218
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:35,113
But typically, the small 
n x N-matrix A

219
00:16:35,945 --> 00:16:40,157
has full rank because
C has full rank.

220
00:16:41,246 --> 00:16:43,721
So we can form the pseudo inverse

221
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:50,532
which gives us a particular
solution

222
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:56,100
to the linear system
that we saw on the previous slide.

223
00:16:57,425 --> 00:17:00,862
By the definition of the pseudo 
inverse, this is in fact

224
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:04,685
the unique solution of
the linear system

225
00:17:05,521 --> 00:17:08,408
with minimal Euclidean norm.

226
00:17:10,984 --> 00:17:14,109
If we write down what this
Euclidean norm looks like

227
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:18,011
we now understand in hind sight

228
00:17:18,211 --> 00:17:23,961
why we have weighted these
bond price increments

229
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:29,098
by the square root of the difference
of the maturity dates.

230
00:17:32,075 --> 00:17:38,737
Indeed the square here implies
that we can omit the square root

231
00:17:39,972 --> 00:17:45,572
and multiply instead these 
expressions with delta(δ).

232
00:17:45,909 --> 00:17:48,747
So this gives us a first order proxy

233
00:17:49,576 --> 00:17:51,188
of the integral

234
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:55,100
of the derivative of the discount
curve squared

235
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,400
with respect to maturity.

236
00:17:58,296 --> 00:18:01,508
We thus obtain the smoothest
possible discount curve

237
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,933
according to this criterion.

238
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,715
Let us revisit the example that we
saw in the bootstrapping example.

239
00:18:09,915 --> 00:18:13,752
US market data from the 1st of
October, 2012

240
00:18:14,587 --> 00:18:17,350
we had 39 cash flow dates,

241
00:18:17,712 --> 00:18:21,937
including the spot date we had
40 points on the discount curve.

242
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:27,891
The discount curve is shown here
on the left hand side

243
00:18:28,613 --> 00:18:32,488
and zoomed in on the
right hand side

244
00:18:32,915 --> 00:18:35,915
as a function of time to maturity.

245
00:18:37,538 --> 00:18:41,613
The implied yield curve and
the forward curve

246
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,768
is still irregular

247
00:18:45,754 --> 00:18:48,066
but the comparison shows 
it is smoother 

248
00:18:48,266 --> 00:18:51,266
than the one that we got
from the bootstrapping.

249
00:18:53,534 --> 00:18:55,059
Summarizing

250
00:18:55,348 --> 00:18:59,073
the pseudo inverse provides a
valuable alternative

251
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:01,373
to the bootstrapping method.

252
00:19:01,637 --> 00:19:06,387
It is an exact method that is very
simple to implement

253
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:11,356
and that yields the smoothest
possible yield curves.
