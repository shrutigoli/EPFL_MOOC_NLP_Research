1
00:00:05,791 --> 00:00:10,054
In short rate models, we specify 
the dynamics of the short rates. 

2
00:00:11,476 --> 00:00:15,101
In the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework
we take a different approach. 

3
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:19,924
We specify evolution of the entire
forward curve directly. 

4
00:00:20,613 --> 00:00:23,901
As a consequence, 
the initial forward curve 

5
00:00:24,138 --> 00:00:26,601
enters as an exogenous parameter.

6
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:30,140
So there are no tiers with fitting 
the initial forward curve

7
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:33,118
as we had then 
with the short rate models. 

8
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:38,511
We will see that the drift
of the forward rate dynamics 

9
00:00:38,744 --> 00:00:42,620
is going to be fully determined
by the volatility

10
00:00:42,817 --> 00:00:44,629
 of the forward rate dynamics. 

11
00:00:44,846 --> 00:00:48,284
This is the famous 
HJM drift condition. 

12
00:00:49,455 --> 00:00:52,555
The HJM framework is very broad

13
00:00:52,785 --> 00:00:55,884
and it contains 
all interest rates models 

14
00:00:56,153 --> 00:00:59,916
which are driven by a finite number
of Brownian motions. 

15
00:01:00,661 --> 00:01:06,499
Formally as ingredients, again,
we fix filtered probability space 

16
00:01:07,652 --> 00:01:13,352
which is now carrying 
a d dimensional Brownian motion. 

17
00:01:15,286 --> 00:01:18,824
A d dimension Brownian motion
is simply composed 

18
00:01:19,038 --> 00:01:25,775
of independent standard scale
of Brownian motions W1 to Wd. 

19
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:32,488
In turn, we need the market prizes
of risks that we stack

20
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:37,372
into the d dimensional market price
of risk, back to the Lambda

21
00:01:37,627 --> 00:01:40,690
and the Girsanov theorem 
still applies 

22
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:46,372
under the risk neutral measure Q
which is equivalent to P

23
00:01:46,616 --> 00:01:51,253
with the Radom-Nikodym density 
process as given here.

24
00:01:51,826 --> 00:01:58,388
Under this measure, the pros is W*
which is the Brownian motion

25
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:03,436
and the P plus the market price 
of risk drift

26
00:02:04,309 --> 00:02:06,709
is a Brownian motion under Q. 

27
00:02:08,066 --> 00:02:13,128
The Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework 
or HJM framework

28
00:02:13,630 --> 00:02:17,180
is very broad and contains 
all interest rate models

29
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:20,718
driven by a finite number 
of Brownian motions. 

30
00:02:21,585 --> 00:02:27,296
We specify directly the evolution on
the Q of the entire forward curve.

31
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:32,163
Formally this means, 
|for every maturity capital T,

32
00:02:32,645 --> 00:02:36,133
we the forward rate process 
as a process in small T

33
00:02:37,191 --> 00:02:42,416
follow an Ito process 
with drift alpha.  

34
00:02:42,914 --> 00:02:48,402
Hence, volatility sigma 
which are both indexed

35
00:02:48,645 --> 00:02:52,395
by the maturity capital T
but otherwise 

36
00:02:52,658 --> 00:02:57,283
are processes in small t
as we're used to 

37
00:02:57,513 --> 00:03:01,113
in the case 
of generic Ito processes.

38
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,804
We will see later on 
that the drift process, alpha 

39
00:03:06,004 --> 00:03:09,479
is going to be fully determined 
by sigma.

40
00:03:09,687 --> 00:03:13,849
That is going to be a consequence
of the Arbitrage pricing theory. 

41
00:03:14,537 --> 00:03:19,337
keep in mind that Sigma is now 
a vector valued process. 

42
00:03:20,518 --> 00:03:24,555
We stack the d component sigma 1
up to sigma d

43
00:03:25,012 --> 00:03:28,787
into this row vector
that we call sigma. 

44
00:03:29,660 --> 00:03:33,473
We're also given 
as an exogenous parameter

45
00:03:33,703 --> 00:03:38,177
and initial forward curve 
f(0), capital T. 

46
00:03:39,617 --> 00:03:45,216
Bond prices are explicit in terms
of the forward curve. 

47
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:51,540
This is in contrast 
to the short rate models 

48
00:03:51,816 --> 00:03:54,966
where bond prices 
were  given implicit

49
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:58,390
in terms of 
the integrated short rates 

50
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:01,177
via the conditional expectation

51
00:04:01,401 --> 00:04:03,801
under the risk neutral measure. 

52
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:06,750
Hence in contrast 
to short rate models, 

53
00:04:06,994 --> 00:04:11,394
here, we can directly infer 
the dynamics of the bond prices 

54
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:15,132
in terms of dynamics 
of the forward rates 

55
00:04:15,348 --> 00:04:17,973
by using Ito's formula. 

56
00:04:18,776 --> 00:04:21,876
Let's do this in several steps. 

57
00:04:22,568 --> 00:04:26,756
We first start with the process
that is in the exponent 

58
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,648
of the right hand side. 

59
00:04:30,881 --> 00:04:35,331
We see that the running time small T
showing up at two places,

60
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:39,957
as an integration boundary
and the time argument

61
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:42,595
 of the forward rate process.

62
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,975
Formally differentiating 
under the integral sign 

63
00:04:46,177 --> 00:04:49,602
gives us the integrant 

64
00:04:50,205 --> 00:04:54,718
at the lower integration boundary, 
f, small t, small t

65
00:04:54,934 --> 00:04:58,246
which by the way just 
to short rate, r(t)

66
00:04:58,441 --> 00:05:02,066
as we're going to, right here, 

67
00:05:02,274 --> 00:05:07,611
minus the integral of
the differential of the integrant.

68
00:05:08,824 --> 00:05:12,299
We then plug in the differential
of the forward rates 

69
00:05:12,518 --> 00:05:17,631
and change the order 
of integration dt, du 

70
00:05:17,828 --> 00:05:23,753
and the same with dW*(t), du
and we arrive 

71
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:30,012
at the second line here 
where we use short hand notation

72
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:34,803
and define v(t, T) 

73
00:05:35,015 --> 00:05:40,003
as minus the integrated 
forward rate volatility. 

74
00:05:41,447 --> 00:05:45,547
Summarizing this first step, 
we shown that the T bond price 

75
00:05:45,747 --> 00:05:49,522
is given by the exponential 
of an Ito process 

76
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,613
whose the composition 
is given here. 

77
00:05:54,618 --> 00:05:57,793
We can now apply the Ito formula. 

78
00:05:58,772 --> 00:06:02,397
The Ito formula applied 
to the exponential function 

79
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:08,157
gives us what we see here
on the first slide. 

80
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:15,209
Notice that I have divided 
on both sides by T bond price.

81
00:06:16,474 --> 00:06:19,024
Plugging in the expression 
for the Ito composition 

82
00:06:19,206 --> 00:06:21,868
of this process here 
from the previous slide, 

83
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,921
we arrive at what is shown here. 

84
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:30,803
This is the T bond return 
decomposition into drift component 

85
00:06:31,034 --> 00:06:34,046
and martingale component. 

86
00:06:34,891 --> 00:06:39,204
From the Arbitrage Pricing Theorem,
we know that 

87
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:45,372
the expected rate of return 
to drift of

88
00:06:46,636 --> 00:06:51,024
the T bond 
under the measure Q

89
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:55,009
has to be equal 
to the short rate. 

90
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,292
But this implies 
that minus the integral of alpha du

91
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,713
plus one half square of normal v
has to be 0. 

92
00:07:05,864 --> 00:07:10,064
This must true 
for all maturities capital T.

93
00:07:10,802 --> 00:07:16,339
So if we differentiate this equality
in capital T,

94
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,992
we arrive at this 

95
00:07:21,646 --> 00:07:23,996
HJM drift condition. 

96
00:07:24,869 --> 00:07:29,581
The drift of the forward rates 
dynamics alpha

97
00:07:29,785 --> 00:07:35,035
is fully determined in terms of 
the forward rate volatility signal. 

98
00:07:35,832 --> 00:07:40,745
Summarizing, we arrive 
at this HJM theory. 

99
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:46,258
The Q dynamics of the forward rates 
is fully determined 

100
00:07:46,464 --> 00:07:49,064
by the forward rate 
volatility sigma

101
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,908
because the drift 
that we use to label alpha

102
00:07:53,104 --> 00:07:57,379
is given in terms of sigma 
as shown here. 

103
00:07:58,217 --> 00:08:03,317
The corresponding risk neutral
bond price return dynamics 

104
00:08:03,818 --> 00:08:05,656
is of this form. 

105
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:10,069
it has a risk free 
expected rate of return

106
00:08:10,283 --> 00:08:14,946
and a volatility v which again, 

107
00:08:15,169 --> 00:08:20,756
is defined as minus the integrated
forward rate volatility.

108
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,837
The minus sign 
comes from the fact 

109
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:32,055
that an upward shock in 
the Brownian motion W*

110
00:08:32,593 --> 00:08:34,918
drives forward rates up.

111
00:08:35,914 --> 00:08:39,477
Rates going up means  
bond prices go down. 

112
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:47,775
The HJM framework contains 
all the short rates models 

113
00:08:48,025 --> 00:08:49,850
we have seen so far. 

114
00:08:50,056 --> 00:08:54,481
So which HJM model, 
sigma (t, T)

115
00:08:54,727 --> 00:08:58,214
corresponds to the Vasicek 
short rate model. 

116
00:08:58,449 --> 00:08:59,974
To answer this question, 

117
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:04,532
we recap the Vasicek 
short rate model dynamics

118
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:11,973
and we recall that 
the Vasicek short rate model 

119
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:15,166
implies forward rates 

120
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:19,948
which are f Phi functions 
in the prevailing short rates.

121
00:09:20,703 --> 00:09:24,228
The functions A and B
are given in closed form.

122
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:27,879
They solve a system 
of Riccatic equations,

123
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:33,511
the first order derivative of B
is e to the minus kappa, 

124
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:35,983
cap T minus small t. 

125
00:09:36,498 --> 00:09:40,586
This is enough applying 
integration by parts

126
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:45,950
to determine 
the martingale component

127
00:09:46,159 --> 00:09:49,009
of the forward rate dynamics

128
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:51,625
which is as shown here. 

129
00:09:53,053 --> 00:09:56,891
We could as well 
by integrating by parts

130
00:09:57,131 --> 00:10:01,718
we apply stochastic calculus, 
derive the drift  

131
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:05,950
of this implied 
forward rate dynamics. 

132
00:10:06,753 --> 00:10:09,253
But we don't need to go 
through these calculations

133
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:13,599
because the HJM theorem 
already tells us 

134
00:10:13,798 --> 00:10:17,860
what the HJM drift here 
has to to look like. 

135
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:23,356
It is given explicitly in terms 
of the volatility,

136
00:10:24,597 --> 00:10:28,359
the volatility of the forward rates.
