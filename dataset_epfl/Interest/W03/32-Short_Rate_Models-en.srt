1
00:00:05,523 --> 00:00:08,823
We will now see 
how the Arbitrage Pricing Theorem

2
00:00:09,007 --> 00:00:14,419
yields a bond pricing formula
in terms of the short rates.

3
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:19,898
Indeed, the earliest 
interest rate models

4
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:25,405
which date back to 1980s
were short rate models.

5
00:00:26,787 --> 00:00:30,374
The most prominent among 
the two are the Vasicek model

6
00:00:30,585 --> 00:00:32,746
and the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross model. 

7
00:00:32,957 --> 00:00:36,633
You know both are still
very much in use. 

8
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:40,434
They both come with their strengths
and their limitations. 

9
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,267
Limitations are that these models
produce forward curves 

10
00:00:46,475 --> 00:00:48,850
which are low parametric, 
and we have seen  

11
00:00:49,061 --> 00:00:53,925
that this posses problems when 
fitting to a given term structure. 

12
00:00:55,027 --> 00:00:59,765
We remedy this by adding
a time-inhomogeneous term

13
00:01:00,003 --> 00:01:03,178
and that leads us 
to the hull-white extensions.

14
00:01:03,389 --> 00:01:06,389
We now focus on the risk neutral 
measure Q 

15
00:01:06,609 --> 00:01:09,947
and assume, 
given an adapted short rate r. 

16
00:01:10,492 --> 00:01:14,330
The Arbitrage Pricing Theorem
implies that 

17
00:01:14,529 --> 00:01:20,992
the discounted bond prices follow
martingales and Q. 

18
00:01:21,944 --> 00:01:25,395
And that has to hold 
for any maturity, capital T. 

19
00:01:26,105 --> 00:01:29,905
Using the fact that the terminal 
value of the T bond is 1, 

20
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:35,438
and using the defining properties
of a martingale

21
00:01:35,665 --> 00:01:40,027
being the conditional expectation
of its terminal value, 

22
00:01:40,218 --> 00:01:44,256
this leads us to this 
bond pricing formula. 

23
00:01:46,104 --> 00:01:50,229
So that the T bond price 
is the conditional expectation

24
00:01:50,436 --> 00:01:53,523
under the risk neutral measure
of the exponential 

25
00:01:53,774 --> 00:01:57,712
of the time integrated
short rate process. 

26
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:02,703
This is not very explicit and we ask
what are the dynamics 

27
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:06,424
of the T bonds price processes
that we get?

28
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:11,554
While this will depend on the model
for the short rate process, 

29
00:02:11,774 --> 00:02:14,949
under the risk neutral measure Q

30
00:02:15,153 --> 00:02:19,741
and if on top of it we're interested
in the dynamics of P,

31
00:02:19,945 --> 00:02:23,844
 and the real world measure P, 
we also would need to specify

32
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:28,650
the mark price of risk lambda, 
which brings us back from Q to P.

33
00:02:30,373 --> 00:02:33,310
The first model we consider 
is the Vasitek Model. 

34
00:02:34,468 --> 00:02:38,530
The Q dynamics of the short rate
is as shown here. 

35
00:02:40,303 --> 00:02:43,241
This model has four parameters.

36
00:02:44,116 --> 00:02:47,266
Kappa is the mean reversion speed,

37
00:02:47,472 --> 00:02:51,910
theta is the mean reversion level 
and sigma is the volatility. 

38
00:02:52,119 --> 00:02:56,618
The forth parameter, don't forget, 
is the initial value 

39
00:02:56,824 --> 00:03:00,837
of the short rate which is not shown
in the differention notation. 

40
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:04,387
As we will see 
on the following slides, 

41
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:10,434
this is a Gaussian process that
mean reverse to the level theta.

42
00:03:11,716 --> 00:03:15,253
The figure on the right hand side
shows a simulated trajectory

43
00:03:15,455 --> 00:03:18,505
for these parameters as shown here. 

44
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:22,947
The means reversion level
is 8 %.

45
00:03:23,734 --> 00:03:30,021
The process starts at the value 6 %
and we see that the mean reversion

46
00:03:30,244 --> 00:03:33,982
forces it to tend

47
00:03:34,227 --> 00:03:38,002
to the mean reversion level of 8%. 

48
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:43,075
This trend is super posed 
by the martingale part

49
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:48,018
that is larger, 
the larger the sigma parameters is. 

50
00:03:49,052 --> 00:03:51,702
We can solve 
the Vasicek differential equation

51
00:03:51,902 --> 00:03:56,227
shown on the previous slide
for the short rate process r(t)

52
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,167
using the variation 
of constants formula. 

53
00:04:00,362 --> 00:04:03,237
It shows that the solution 
can be written explicitly

54
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:06,823
in integral form as shown here . 

55
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,195
Again you may be familiar 
with this  fact from real calculus 

56
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:14,082
for this part of it. 

57
00:04:14,288 --> 00:04:17,563
Overall, you can verify the validity
of this expression 

58
00:04:17,774 --> 00:04:20,361
by just applying Ito formula. 

59
00:04:21,144 --> 00:04:26,869
This expression also shows 
that r(t) is a Gaussian process

60
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:34,409
with mean function equal to 
the deterministic part of it

61
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:37,593
and the covariance function 
as shown here. 

62
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:42,492
When t tends to infinity, 
we see that the mean 

63
00:04:42,713 --> 00:04:49,662
tends to theta and the variance
when t1 is equal t2, is equal to t, 

64
00:04:50,148 --> 00:04:53,560
tends to sigma square the value
by 2 kappa. 

65
00:04:53,865 --> 00:04:58,152
In deed, the limiting distribution 
of the short rates is normal 

66
00:04:58,358 --> 00:05:01,646
with mean theta 
and variance sigma squared 

67
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,843
divided by two kappa. 

68
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:09,094
Now what about bond prices 
in the Vasicek Model?

69
00:05:11,133 --> 00:05:15,295
We proceed to calculating 
bond prices in two steps.

70
00:05:16,092 --> 00:05:18,217
The first step is to show

71
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:21,591
 that the time-integrated 
short rate process 

72
00:05:21,836 --> 00:05:24,472
is a normal random variable 

73
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:27,546
and we determine 
its characteristics. 

74
00:05:27,745 --> 00:05:31,008
We proceed by plugging in
the solution for r(s)

75
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:34,412
that we saw on the previous slide. 

76
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:39,907
And it gives us the expression here
on the left hand side in black. 

77
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:45,664
We next manipulate these expressions
in two step. 

78
00:05:45,893 --> 00:05:50,043
First is, we change 
the order of integration

79
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:53,334
as shown here. 

80
00:05:54,712 --> 00:06:02,424
we apply that to both the drift term
and the stochastic integral term. 

81
00:06:04,011 --> 00:06:10,435
We then do for both parts
as shown here in the first part 

82
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,303
multiply with e to the minus kappa t

83
00:06:15,148 --> 00:06:17,773
and multiply with e 
to the kappa t again. 

84
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:22,958
We then realize that this integral

85
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:28,710
is equal to B cap T minus t
where the function B

86
00:06:28,914 --> 00:06:32,439
is defined as integral of e
to the minus kappa s. 

87
00:06:33,819 --> 00:06:38,269
We further realize that 
e to the minus kappa t, r(0)

88
00:06:38,489 --> 00:06:45,414
is the first part of the expression
for the short rate r(t)

89
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:47,728
as shown on the previous slide. 

90
00:06:48,681 --> 00:06:52,156
We get the other two parts 
from the drift integral 

91
00:06:52,359 --> 00:06:54,709
and from the stochastic integral 

92
00:06:56,150 --> 00:07:00,600
so that we can summarize 
and get this first to mend 

93
00:07:00,813 --> 00:07:02,713
on the right hand side here. 

94
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:08,500
We also get these two terms
as shown here. 

95
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:11,475
Using the dependence 
of the increments

96
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:14,154
of the Brownian motion,

97
00:07:14,403 --> 00:07:18,078
we realize that 
the stochastic integral

98
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:22,070
is independent of f(t) 

99
00:07:23,548 --> 00:07:29,260
and it is normal with mean 0
and variance given by

100
00:07:29,496 --> 00:07:32,608
the integral of the square 
of the integrant 

101
00:07:32,846 --> 00:07:35,234
with respect to d(u). 

102
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:41,120
The first 2 terms are measurable
with respect to f(t)

103
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,143
because the short rate process
is adopted. 

104
00:07:47,223 --> 00:07:51,385
These observations imply 
that the time-integrated 

105
00:07:51,606 --> 00:07:55,219
short rate process, 
conditional on F(t)

106
00:07:55,457 --> 00:08:01,081
is normal distributed 
with mean given here 

107
00:08:01,281 --> 00:08:03,894
and variance 
given here. 

108
00:08:05,653 --> 00:08:10,728
The bond prize, remember,
is the conditional expectation

109
00:08:10,921 --> 00:08:14,933
of the exponential of the time 
integrated short rate process

110
00:08:15,167 --> 00:08:17,205
with a minus sign 

111
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:21,456
We have just seen that this exponent
is normal distributed.

112
00:08:21,657 --> 00:08:24,357
We know it's mean function
and we know it's variance, 

113
00:08:25,236 --> 00:08:27,873
so we can use 
the moment-generating function

114
00:08:28,096 --> 00:08:30,297
for the normal distribution

115
00:08:30,522 --> 00:08:33,871
plugging the ingredients 
and arrive

116
00:08:34,141 --> 00:08:38,604
at the expression as shown 
on the right hand side here

117
00:08:38,858 --> 00:08:43,671
where the function A 
is defined, here. 

118
00:08:45,368 --> 00:08:48,806
Summarizing the Vasicek 
short rate model 

119
00:08:49,213 --> 00:08:52,376
yields exponential 
afﬁne bond prices in the prevailing

120
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:57,863
short rate r(t) as shown here. 

121
00:08:59,669 --> 00:09:03,832
The functions A and B
can be shown

122
00:09:04,048 --> 00:09:09,799
to solve the two coupled 
ordinary differential equations

123
00:09:13,038 --> 00:09:15,201
which are quadratic. 

124
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:19,232
This is why they are called
Riccati equations 

125
00:09:19,498 --> 00:09:24,561
along with initial conditions
0 and 0, 

126
00:09:25,705 --> 00:09:27,730
for A and B. 

127
00:09:28,327 --> 00:09:31,790
The next short rate model 
we consider

128
00:09:32,007 --> 00:09:34,906
 is the Cox-Ingersell- Ross Model. 

129
00:09:35,126 --> 00:09:38,476
In short, CIR Model.

130
00:09:38,838 --> 00:09:42,226
The Q dynamics of the short rate
look similar to the dynamics 

131
00:09:42,517 --> 00:09:46,279
that we have for the Vasicek model
except that here, 

132
00:09:46,487 --> 00:09:49,400
the volatility of 
the short rate process

133
00:09:49,579 --> 00:09:53,505
depends on the square root
of the short rate itself. 

134
00:09:54,537 --> 00:09:58,550
Again we have the parameters, 
theta, the mean diversion level, 

135
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:04,580
kappa, the mean diversion speed
and sigma, the volatility. 

136
00:10:05,509 --> 00:10:07,772
For technical reasons,
we have to assume 

137
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,845
that kappa times theta
is non-negative. 

138
00:10:12,447 --> 00:10:16,647
In contrast to the Vasicek model,
we can not write down

139
00:10:16,865 --> 00:10:20,752
the solution to this stochastic
 differentiation equation.

140
00:10:21,617 --> 00:10:25,192
but it is a mathematical fact
that there exists

141
00:10:25,494 --> 00:10:30,907
a unique no negative solution
for any no negative initial values. 

142
00:10:31,953 --> 00:10:35,153
We illustrate a similarity 
trajectory

143
00:10:35,415 --> 00:10:38,227
of the CIR short rate process

144
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:41,234
for the same parameter theta,
kappa and sigma

145
00:10:41,485 --> 00:10:44,222
as for the Vasicek model.

146
00:10:44,483 --> 00:10:47,958
Again we start at the level of 6%

147
00:10:48,646 --> 00:10:52,697
Again we have mean reversion
but this time,

148
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:57,169
 the volatility is smaller
because we use the same sigma

149
00:10:57,463 --> 00:10:59,787
which has to be multiplied
with the square root 

150
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:04,982
of the short rate to give
the total volatility contribution. 

151
00:11:05,656 --> 00:11:10,193
These parameters of course, 
have only illustrative character. 

152
00:11:10,724 --> 00:11:13,412
They would have to be calibrated
to specific given 

153
00:11:13,693 --> 00:11:17,344
market data conditions. 

154
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:23,093
But we cannot show it 
from first principles

155
00:11:23,368 --> 00:11:26,043
as we did in the Vasicek model, 

156
00:11:26,365 --> 00:11:29,766
we claim that 
the CIR short rate model

157
00:11:30,015 --> 00:11:33,303
also yields exponential afﬁne
bond prices

158
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:38,425
in the prevailing short rate
as shown here. 

159
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:43,371
The function A and B solve again,
a (inaudible) system 

160
00:11:43,577 --> 00:11:48,214
of differential equations 
which are quadratic.

161
00:11:48,444 --> 00:11:56,919
So Riccati equations, along with
 initial conditions 0 and 0

162
00:11:57,214 --> 00:12:02,377
as was the case for the Vasicek
short rate model,

163
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,966
the solutions A and B 
for this Riccati equations

164
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:10,195
are given in close form. 

165
00:12:12,617 --> 00:12:16,080
They are shown on the slide here. 

166
00:12:20,145 --> 00:12:23,145
We now prove the claim
that the CIR model 

167
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:26,622
yields exponential afﬁne bond price

168
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:30,195
and we use stochastic calculus. 

169
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:35,347
The claim is written here in black. 

170
00:12:37,517 --> 00:12:42,180
We multiply both sides 
of this claimed equation

171
00:12:43,202 --> 00:12:45,990
by the red factor. 

172
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:50,229
This way, we get rid 
of the small t dependence

173
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:54,665
of the argument in the conditional 
expectation on the left hand side. 

174
00:12:54,943 --> 00:12:58,256
We call this argument M(T).

175
00:12:59,617 --> 00:13:04,867
Just looking at the left hand side, 
we realize we have a martingale.

176
00:13:07,392 --> 00:13:10,030
We label the expression 
on the right hand side  

177
00:13:10,244 --> 00:13:12,632
by M(t).

178
00:13:13,719 --> 00:13:19,169
By Ito's formula, this can be seen
to be an Ito process.

179
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:26,005
We also see because of the initial
 conditions A and B being 0, 

180
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:32,107
that M(T), in deed coincides 
with the argument

181
00:13:32,342 --> 00:13:35,068
on the left hand side. 

182
00:13:35,262 --> 00:13:39,174
Hence, in order to prove equality
between these two sides, 

183
00:13:39,404 --> 00:13:44,916
it is now enough to prove 
that M(t) is a martingale. 

184
00:13:46,586 --> 00:13:53,199
We do this by applying integration
by parts, and Ito formula, to M. 

185
00:13:54,668 --> 00:14:00,181
A few lines of stochastic calculus 
shows us that the drift 

186
00:14:00,466 --> 00:14:04,666
of the M which we already 
divided by M

187
00:14:04,855 --> 00:14:06,954
because it factors out, 

188
00:14:07,189 --> 00:14:11,127
equals the expression 
that is given here. 

189
00:14:13,002 --> 00:14:17,827
Now both components of this sum
are zero, 

190
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:22,588
and this is due to the fact 
that A and B 

191
00:14:22,824 --> 00:14:28,062
satisfy the Riccati equation
shown in the claim. 

192
00:14:29,294 --> 00:14:34,007
This proves indeed that M
has zero drift, 

193
00:14:34,179 --> 00:14:37,917
in other words, 
M is a martingale. 

194
00:14:39,797 --> 00:14:43,160
Both models, the Vasicek 
and the CIR models

195
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:48,922
yield closed-form expressions
for the bond prices. 

196
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:54,749
It can also be shown 
that they yield analytic expressions

197
00:14:54,975 --> 00:14:58,124
for auction prices and bonds. 

198
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:02,279
This explains why they
are very popular.

199
00:15:03,724 --> 00:15:07,550
This models also have a weakness. 

200
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,250
In both models

201
00:15:10,448 --> 00:15:14,874
the forward curve 
is given in closed form

202
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:17,832
in terms of the functions A and B. 

203
00:15:19,415 --> 00:15:24,515
Now the functions A and B
are determined by the parameters

204
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,325
kappa, theta, and sigma. 

205
00:15:27,503 --> 00:15:30,015
If we count the initial values 
of the short rate 

206
00:15:30,255 --> 00:15:31,780
as a fourth parameter, 

207
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:35,370
it shows us that 
the initial forward curve 

208
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:39,893
produced by either model, 
the Vasicek and the CIR

209
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:44,291
is for parametric. 

210
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:50,479
The problem that comes with it
is that these models

211
00:15:50,702 --> 00:15:54,465
do not fit the data in general. 

212
00:15:55,797 --> 00:15:59,035
It is illustrated here
for the CIR model 

213
00:15:59,305 --> 00:16:01,192
with these parameters,

214
00:16:01,376 --> 00:16:07,314
the red is the implied 
initial forward curve 

215
00:16:07,561 --> 00:16:13,498
which cannot match 
the observed data points in general

216
00:16:14,772 --> 00:16:18,222
because of its low degree of freedom

217
00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:22,746
Fortunately, there's 
an easy solution to it. 

218
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:27,300
The idea is to add 
a time-inhomogeneous 

219
00:16:27,552 --> 00:16:31,365
and its component to it 
with infinity degree of freedom

220
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:37,430
in such a way that you preserve
the analytic tractability

221
00:16:37,682 --> 00:16:40,569
of the model on the other hand. 

222
00:16:41,659 --> 00:16:43,947
Here is how the idea works.

223
00:16:44,350 --> 00:16:47,751
It is illustrated 
for the Vasicek model

224
00:16:48,042 --> 00:16:51,655
but it will equally-well work
for the CIR model, 

225
00:16:52,271 --> 00:16:56,446
and in fact, for any 
diffusion short rate models. 

226
00:16:57,814 --> 00:17:01,265
We need 2 ingredients. 

227
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:08,521
The first is an auxiliary simple 
Vasicek model as show here. 

228
00:17:10,336 --> 00:17:16,336
We assume that initial short rate
matches the data.

229
00:17:16,876 --> 00:17:21,439
In blue we indicate a given
initial forward curve. 

230
00:17:22,356 --> 00:17:25,868
As we well know, the Vasicek model 

231
00:17:26,117 --> 00:17:29,693
yields closed-form exponential
afﬁne bond prices.

232
00:17:30,481 --> 00:17:34,156
For functions A tilde  and B tilde, 
given in terms

233
00:17:34,359 --> 00:17:37,910
of solutions of Riccatic equations. 

234
00:17:39,655 --> 00:17:45,267
The second ingredient 
is a deterministic function Phi T

235
00:17:45,544 --> 00:17:48,119
with 0 initial value. 

236
00:17:48,745 --> 00:17:52,757
We then get a time-inhomogenous
short rate model r(t), 

237
00:17:52,935 --> 00:17:58,535
as the sum of r(t) plus the auxiliary 
simple Vaiscek model r tilde. 

238
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:03,842
Notice already that 
these short rate models

239
00:18:04,051 --> 00:18:08,838
matches the initial short rates
by construction

240
00:18:09,073 --> 00:18:12,160
because Phi 0 is 0, 
and r tilde 0, 

241
00:18:12,438 --> 00:18:16,175
is the desired initial value. 

242
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:22,116
The bond prices are still given
in closed form.

243
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:28,370
This is a simple consequence 
of this observation done here. 

244
00:18:30,373 --> 00:18:34,036
From this, we easily infer 
that the model implied 

245
00:18:34,257 --> 00:18:38,595
initial forward curve 
is given a shown here. 

246
00:18:40,861 --> 00:18:44,099
And now, it is evident that we will

247
00:18:44,754 --> 00:18:49,817
obtain a perfect fit 
of the given initial forward curve

248
00:18:50,947 --> 00:18:54,685
whenever we choose 
the right function Phi

249
00:18:54,914 --> 00:19:00,464
as the difference of the given 
initial forward curve

250
00:19:00,683 --> 00:19:07,271
minus model implied forward curve
from the auxiliary Vasicek model. 

251
00:19:09,412 --> 00:19:13,288
What can we say about the dynamics
of the time-inhomogeneous 

252
00:19:13,523 --> 00:19:15,849
short rate process r(t). 

253
00:19:17,757 --> 00:19:21,620
Let's illustrate these 
for the Vasicek short rate model.

254
00:19:24,594 --> 00:19:30,607
So assume r tilde is the auxiliary 
Vasicek short rate model 

255
00:19:30,866 --> 00:19:33,554
as seen on the previous slides. 

256
00:19:35,383 --> 00:19:41,308
We then simply differentiate 
the sum of Phi(t) plus r tilde(t), 

257
00:19:43,542 --> 00:19:47,905
to get the differential of r 
in this form. 

258
00:19:50,262 --> 00:19:55,524
We then r tilde
by r minus Phi, 

259
00:19:55,783 --> 00:20:01,684
and it follows that r(t)  
has a decomposition as shown here 

260
00:20:02,331 --> 00:20:06,332
where now the theta 
is a t-dependent function 

261
00:20:06,552 --> 00:20:10,315
given in terms of Phi, this way. 

262
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:13,723
It becomes evident that we 
just obtained 

263
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:17,664
an extension of the Vasicek model
by making this constant theta 

264
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:21,113
a time-dependence theta. 

265
00:20:21,512 --> 00:20:26,512
This extension is also called
the Hull-White Model. 

266
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:30,569
In sum, the Hull-White Model, 

267
00:20:30,844 --> 00:20:35,445
yields closed-form exponential
afﬁne bond prices 

268
00:20:36,106 --> 00:20:43,056
and at the same time matches 
any given initial forward curve.
