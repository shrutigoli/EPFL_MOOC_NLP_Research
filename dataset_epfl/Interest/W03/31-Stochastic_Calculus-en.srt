1
00:00:05,037 --> 00:00:06,038
We now consider 

2
00:00:06,238 --> 00:00:08,259
Stochastic interest rate models.

3
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:10,853
In the first part,

4
00:00:11,053 --> 00:00:14,053
I'll provide the basics
in Stochastic calculus,

5
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,685
that is needed for developing 

6
00:00:16,865 --> 00:00:18,693
Stochastic interest rate models.

7
00:00:19,755 --> 00:00:20,993
We will then look at 

8
00:00:21,218 --> 00:00:22,710
short-rate models,

9
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,274
where the dynamics of the short-rate

10
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:27,598
is specified;

11
00:00:27,798 --> 00:00:29,027
and in a second step

12
00:00:29,227 --> 00:00:30,815
we'll look at so-called

13
00:00:31,015 --> 00:00:33,050
Heath-Jarrow-Morton models, where,

14
00:00:33,162 --> 00:00:35,897
the evolution of the entire
forward curve is specified,

15
00:00:36,097 --> 00:00:37,778
as a Stochastic process.

16
00:00:37,978 --> 00:00:40,253
Eventually, we will see

17
00:00:40,916 --> 00:00:42,551
how these models can be used

18
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:44,442
to price options on bonds.

19
00:00:47,334 --> 00:00:48,782
In this first part,

20
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:53,798
I recap the basic notions of
Stochastic calculus.

21
00:00:55,371 --> 00:00:57,397
That is: Brownian motion,

22
00:00:58,093 --> 00:00:59,771
the Stochastic integral

23
00:01:00,606 --> 00:01:01,717
Ito formula,

24
00:01:02,884 --> 00:01:03,988
the Girsanov theorem.

25
00:01:05,229 --> 00:01:08,667
Obviously we cannot go into
the mathematical details.

26
00:01:09,579 --> 00:01:10,744
But the good news is,

27
00:01:11,726 --> 00:01:15,694
once you acquire the rules
of Stochastic calculus,

28
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:21,270
you can engineer any of
the following interest rate models.

29
00:01:21,708 --> 00:01:24,011
I will also, in this part,

30
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:28,009
give you the basics for
pricing options,

31
00:01:28,526 --> 00:01:31,036
namely,
the Arbitrage pricing theorem

32
00:01:32,726 --> 00:01:35,141
We always fix a Stochastic basis.

33
00:01:37,535 --> 00:01:40,862
Random variables are modeled on
a probability space.

34
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:44,069
This is a triple consisting of

35
00:01:44,454 --> 00:01:46,476
the set of samples Omega;

36
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:49,605
and on this set of samples Omega

37
00:01:50,118 --> 00:01:53,848
we have a structure
which is called a sigma algebra,

38
00:01:54,912 --> 00:01:56,843
which is denoted by a caligraphic F.

39
00:01:58,408 --> 00:02:00,045
This is the collection of 

40
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:02,469
the so-called measurable events.

41
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:05,410
The probability measure P,

42
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,260
acts on the sigma algebra,

43
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:08,797
caligraphic F

44
00:02:09,009 --> 00:02:12,372
and it assigns a probability to
any measuble event, A.

45
00:02:13,047 --> 00:02:14,516
The flow of information

46
00:02:14,748 --> 00:02:18,055
is modeled by a filtration.

47
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:22,397
This is an increasing family of
sigma algebras

48
00:02:22,993 --> 00:02:27,224
indexed by time, t.
And F,t

49
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,006
represents the information
available by time, t.

50
00:02:33,386 --> 00:02:35,109
Let's look at following example

51
00:02:35,399 --> 00:02:38,944
which consists of a sample set 

52
00:02:39,149 --> 00:02:40,986
  consisting of four samples.p

53
00:02:42,854 --> 00:02:45,465
Suppose the probability assigns
the same weight

54
00:02:45,614 --> 00:02:47,076
to each sample.

55
00:02:47,855 --> 00:02:49,547
We have two time periods.

56
00:02:50,835 --> 00:02:52,175
At t2,

57
00:02:53,786 --> 00:02:57,224
the true state of
the nature is fully revealed

58
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,749
However at t1,

59
00:03:00,396 --> 00:03:03,659
we can only tell whether
we are in the set,

60
00:03:03,854 --> 00:03:06,854
cosisting of Omega 1 and Omega 2

61
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:11,802
or in the set consisting of
Omega 3 and Omega 4.

62
00:03:12,143 --> 00:03:14,830
So the signma algebra F1

63
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,930
consists of the two sets:

64
00:03:19,654 --> 00:03:23,016
Omega 1, Omega 2
and Omega 3, Omega 4.

65
00:03:24,477 --> 00:03:27,965
At t0, the sigma algebra is trivial.

66
00:03:28,851 --> 00:03:34,164
We cannot distinguish
any of the samples at time 0.

67
00:03:35,485 --> 00:03:37,171
A stochastic proces

68
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:41,371
is a family of random variables
indexed by time t.

69
00:03:43,824 --> 00:03:47,897
We usually suppress
the argument omega.

70
00:03:48,778 --> 00:03:51,778
We call the stochastic process
adapted

71
00:03:51,978 --> 00:03:54,453
if for any fixed time, t,

72
00:03:54,678 --> 00:03:59,412
the random variable Xt
is Ft measurable.

73
00:04:00,064 --> 00:04:04,537
We call Xt a martingale
if it is adapted

74
00:04:05,755 --> 00:04:07,305
and such that,

75
00:04:07,655 --> 00:04:10,293
at any time t.

76
00:04:10,694 --> 00:04:12,405
The conditional expectation of

77
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,875
the future values
at some time point, T,

78
00:04:16,387 --> 00:04:21,075
is just equal to the currently
prevailing value.

79
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:23,066
A martingale

80
00:04:23,878 --> 00:04:25,659
is a model for fair game.

81
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:28,859
In the sense that on average,

82
00:04:29,123 --> 00:04:32,885
you cannot gain more than
what you have today.

83
00:04:34,205 --> 00:04:35,646
As an example,

84
00:04:35,868 --> 00:04:39,051
consider again the Stochastic basis
from the previous slide;

85
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,882
and let's assume that Xt models

86
00:04:43,082 --> 00:04:46,832
the price of a financial asset
at state T

87
00:04:48,555 --> 00:04:51,792
and assume that Xt is adapted.

88
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:54,835
In the two period context

89
00:04:55,035 --> 00:04:58,948
it means at t2,
we know the terminal price,

90
00:04:59,692 --> 00:05:02,172
which is a function of
the state of the world.

91
00:05:04,968 --> 00:05:08,746
At t1, we cannot anticipate
the future.

92
00:05:09,146 --> 00:05:11,296
So, the asked price

93
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:17,443
must be the same
in the state Omega 1, Omega 2.

94
00:05:18,408 --> 00:05:21,408
and also it must be the same

95
00:05:21,608 --> 00:05:23,754
in the two states Omega 3, Omega 4.

96
00:05:25,162 --> 00:05:26,881
At t0 we have no information yet,

97
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:31,504
and the asked prices is a constant.

98
00:05:32,243 --> 00:05:34,605
The prototype of a martingale

99
00:05:34,805 --> 00:05:36,504
in continuous time,

100
00:05:36,685 --> 00:05:37,995
is a Brownian motion.

101
00:05:38,852 --> 00:05:41,044
A standard Brownian motion, W,

102
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:44,206
is characterized by
the following four properties:

103
00:05:45,449 --> 00:05:47,685
it is continuous and adapted process,

104
00:05:48,067 --> 00:05:50,041
it starts at t0,

105
00:05:50,787 --> 00:05:55,024
and its increments w(t2)-w(t1)

106
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:58,342
are independent of the past

107
00:05:58,592 --> 00:06:00,842
and normally distributed

108
00:06:01,236 --> 00:06:06,748
with mean 0 and variants proportional
to the time increment.

109
00:06:08,294 --> 00:06:09,632
As I already said,

110
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:12,735
the Brownian motion is
a continuous martingale.

111
00:06:13,489 --> 00:06:14,688
The figure on the right

112
00:06:14,888 --> 00:06:19,450
shows four trajectories simulated
from a Brownian motion.

113
00:06:21,568 --> 00:06:23,502
All trajectories start at 0.

114
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,451
As you can see,

115
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,540
Brownian motion has rough paths.

116
00:06:28,178 --> 00:06:29,342
They are not smooth.

117
00:06:29,516 --> 00:06:31,124
They are not differentiable.

118
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:34,036
And at any given point in time,

119
00:06:35,844 --> 00:06:40,078
the expectation of
the Brownian motion is equal to 0.

120
00:06:41,653 --> 00:06:43,970
A Brownian motion is
a Gaussian process

121
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:45,367
in the following sets:

122
00:06:45,567 --> 00:06:48,567
We define a Stochastic process Z(t)

123
00:06:48,767 --> 00:06:50,671
to be a Gaussian process

124
00:06:51,543 --> 00:06:55,495
if its final dimensional distributions

125
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:00,076
are multivariate Gaussian
or normal distributed

126
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:05,585
for any finite selection
of time points t1 up to tn.

127
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:11,122
Since the multivariate normal distribution
is determined by its mean vector

128
00:07:11,322 --> 00:07:13,623
and the covariance matrix,

129
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:17,488
it follows that the distribution
of a Gaussian process Z(t)

130
00:07:18,263 --> 00:07:21,015
is determined by its mean function,

131
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:22,826
that we call m(t),

132
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:26,475
and the covariance function,

133
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:29,116
which gives the pair of covariances

134
00:07:29,353 --> 00:07:31,291
of Zt1 and Zt2.

135
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:35,312
For any adapted process sigma(t),

136
00:07:36,005 --> 00:07:39,455
whose trajectories are
square integrable in time,

137
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:43,340
we can define the Stochastic integral

138
00:07:43,527 --> 00:07:46,540
with respect to a Brownian motion.

139
00:07:48,018 --> 00:07:50,882
This is how we denote
the stochastic integral.

140
00:07:51,768 --> 00:07:55,180
Even though the rigourous definition
of the stochastic integral

141
00:07:55,385 --> 00:07:56,761
is a bit more involved,

142
00:07:57,974 --> 00:07:59,961
we can think of it as being

143
00:08:00,188 --> 00:08:04,438
the limit of remaining sums
as shown here.

144
00:08:06,327 --> 00:08:09,877
Where we go over partitions of time

145
00:08:10,811 --> 00:08:12,696
and let the mesh tend to 0.

146
00:08:14,147 --> 00:08:16,579
It can be proved that
the stochastic integral

147
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:18,512
is a continuous martingale,

148
00:08:19,264 --> 00:08:23,349
if the integral satisfies a somewhat
strong integrability condition.

149
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:25,895
The stochastic integral

150
00:08:26,107 --> 00:08:28,850
will be the model for the risky part

151
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,285
of the return of an asset.

152
00:08:32,903 --> 00:08:34,613
An ito process X(t)

153
00:08:34,801 --> 00:08:37,714
is an adapted process
of the following form.

154
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:43,655
It can be decomposed
into an initial value,

155
00:08:45,038 --> 00:08:47,387
plus a drift term,

156
00:08:49,678 --> 00:08:51,488
plus a martingale term, 

157
00:08:51,688 --> 00:08:53,567
which is a stochastic integral.

158
00:08:55,397 --> 00:08:57,259
Remember that the Brownian motion,

159
00:08:57,472 --> 00:08:58,985
and therefore
the stochastic integral,

160
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:01,300
has rough trajectories.

161
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,480
The drift in contrast

162
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,131
has smooth trajectories

163
00:09:07,369 --> 00:09:11,172
and models trends
in the evolution of X.

164
00:09:12,913 --> 00:09:15,121
An ito process is thus

165
00:09:15,321 --> 00:09:18,596
the ideal model for the price process
of a financial asset.

166
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:22,780
We often use
differential notation for X

167
00:09:23,419 --> 00:09:25,767
where we omit the initial value

168
00:09:26,706 --> 00:09:29,131
and write as shown here.

169
00:09:30,245 --> 00:09:31,301
Keep in mind,

170
00:09:31,501 --> 00:09:34,976
whenever we specify an ito process X
in differential notation,

171
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,125
there is always an initial value
to be specified with it.

172
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:49,187
Sigma is also called
the volatility of the process X.

173
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,067
It can be proved that

174
00:09:52,355 --> 00:09:55,417
if the initial value, the drift,

175
00:09:55,665 --> 00:09:59,153
and the volatility of X,
are deterministic functions,

176
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:04,284
then, the procss X(t)
is a Gaussian process

177
00:10:04,743 --> 00:10:09,167
with the following mean and
covariance functions, as shown here.

178
00:10:10,898 --> 00:10:15,090
It is easy to understand why
the mean function is as shown here,

179
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:20,815
because the martingale
has zero expectations.

180
00:10:21,696 --> 00:10:25,617
We take for granted that
the second moment of the martingale

181
00:10:25,949 --> 00:10:31,363
is given by
the integal of sigma² ds.

182
00:10:32,903 --> 00:10:37,284
The core of stochastic calculus
is the ito formula.

183
00:10:39,229 --> 00:10:43,942
It states that for
a C²-function f(x), 

184
00:10:44,517 --> 00:10:48,833
meaning, the function x
is twice continuously differentiable,

185
00:10:50,577 --> 00:10:52,885
and for an ito process X(t) 

186
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:55,475
which is given in
differential notation here,

187
00:10:56,346 --> 00:11:03,230
the composiition f applied to X,
is again an ito process

188
00:11:04,344 --> 00:11:08,849
with the composition given by that.

189
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,385
It is important to see
that real calculus

190
00:11:13,522 --> 00:11:17,449
would give us a total derivative
that is underlined.

191
00:11:18,821 --> 00:11:21,417
But this would only hold if X(t)

192
00:11:21,617 --> 00:11:23,915
would have differentiable trajectories.

193
00:11:25,555 --> 00:11:29,046
Recall that the stochastic integral
has rough trajectories

194
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:31,026
which are not differentiable,

195
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,280
which is inherited by X(t);

196
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:39,478
and that causes the appearance of

197
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:43,136
a second order correction term.

198
00:11:44,513 --> 00:11:47,513
It also explains why this formula only

199
00:11:47,713 --> 00:11:50,713
works for C²-functions f.

200
00:11:51,507 --> 00:11:54,507
We need f to be twice
continuously differential.

201
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:59,291
There is also a multivariate version
of ito's formula

202
00:11:59,735 --> 00:12:02,335
but I'll refrain from showing it here,

203
00:12:02,505 --> 00:12:04,515
with the following exception:

204
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:08,108
The integration by parts formula.

205
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:13,448
It states that for
two ito processes X1 and X2,

206
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:15,425
both indifferential,

207
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:17,748
notation as shown here

208
00:12:18,355 --> 00:12:23,698
the product X1 times X2
is again an ito process,

209
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:27,463
with the composition as shown here.

210
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:32,015
Again we realize that
this is the product rule

211
00:12:32,215 --> 00:12:35,215
that we are knowing from real calculus;

212
00:12:35,415 --> 00:12:41,342
but that holds only if X1 and X2
had differentiable trajectories.

213
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:45,636
Since they do not, due to
the stochastic integral,

214
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:48,836
we have the second order correction term.

215
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:54,143
As an example of ito's formula,

216
00:12:54,343 --> 00:12:59,566
let's look at the exponential function
applied to an ito process X,

217
00:12:59,766 --> 00:13:02,766
which is given in
differential notation here.

218
00:13:04,081 --> 00:13:07,081
The decomposition of e to the X

219
00:13:07,561 --> 00:13:11,486
is given by the sum of the derivative
of e to the X,

220
00:13:11,586 --> 00:13:12,987
which is e to the x itself,

221
00:13:13,187 --> 00:13:18,043
dX, plus
the second order correction term;

222
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:23,474
which involves the second order derivative
of the exponential function,

223
00:13:23,674 --> 00:13:26,427
which is again
the exponential function itself.

224
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:32,055
Again, we see here
the fundamental differential equation

225
00:13:32,255 --> 00:13:39,140
that Y would satisfy if X(t) would have
differential trajectories.

226
00:13:41,033 --> 00:13:46,558
There is a counter-part to the classical
exponential function in stochastic calculus.

227
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:49,315
It's called the stochastic exponential

228
00:13:49,437 --> 00:13:52,206
and it's denoted by a calligraphic E.

229
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:56,243
It is defined as shown here.

230
00:13:57,077 --> 00:14:00,804
It is now an exercise
for you applying ito formula.

231
00:14:01,071 --> 00:14:04,225
to show that the stochastic exponential

232
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:10,705
actually satisfies the fundamental stochastic
differential equation,

233
00:14:12,881 --> 00:14:17,766
which corresponds to the fundamental equation
that would hold in real calculus

234
00:14:17,966 --> 00:14:21,601
if X would have differentiable trajectories.

235
00:14:22,506 --> 00:14:28,199
This property of the stochastic exponential
is very useful for two reasons

236
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:30,241
First of all,

237
00:14:30,441 --> 00:14:34,902
the stochastic exponential is
positive by definition.

238
00:14:35,618 --> 00:14:40,570
This is useful because
most price processes of financial assets

239
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:42,439
are positive.

240
00:14:44,145 --> 00:14:48,564
And second, due to this fundamental
stochastic differential equation,

241
00:14:50,294 --> 00:14:54,602
the stochastic exponential
preserves the martingale property.

242
00:14:56,076 --> 00:15:00,131
That means if X is a martingale,

243
00:15:01,641 --> 00:15:05,878
Then the stochastic exponential
of X is also a martingale.

244
00:15:06,516 --> 00:15:10,916
In sum, the stochastic exponential
is the prototype

245
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:16,287
of  a positive martingale
in stochastic calculus.

246
00:15:18,731 --> 00:15:23,469
In financial modeling, we often
change the probability measure.

247
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:29,418
This is why it is useful
to review base rules.

248
00:15:31,122 --> 00:15:35,232
Let Q and P be
equivalent probability measures

249
00:15:35,649 --> 00:15:38,136
with Radon-Nikodym density,

250
00:15:39,749 --> 00:15:42,895
denoted by dQ over dP.

251
00:15:44,867 --> 00:15:50,357
Base rule relates conditional
expectations on the P and Q.

252
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:54,590
For any bounded random variable X,

253
00:15:54,788 --> 00:15:58,413
the conditional expectation
of X on the Q

254
00:15:58,613 --> 00:16:03,094
can be expressed
as conditional expectation on the P,

255
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:10,284
if we multiply the argument X
by the Radon-Nikodym density of Q

256
00:16:10,396 --> 00:16:11,811
with respect to P;

257
00:16:12,308 --> 00:16:19,509
and normalize by the conditional expectation
of the Radon-Nikodym density.

258
00:16:25,047 --> 00:16:26,768
If we vary little t,

259
00:16:29,623 --> 00:16:31,506
then this becomes a martingale.

260
00:16:31,706 --> 00:16:34,706
It's called
a Radon-Nikodym density process.

261
00:16:35,749 --> 00:16:38,122
It is a positive martingale.

262
00:16:40,795 --> 00:16:45,167
The Girsanov theorem describes
what happens to a Brownian motion on the P

263
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:48,448
when we change to an equivalent
probability measure Q.

264
00:16:50,314 --> 00:16:51,831
The statement is as follows:

265
00:16:52,532 --> 00:16:55,532
For an adapted process lambda,

266
00:16:55,732 --> 00:16:57,870
satifying some more
technical conditions,

267
00:16:59,171 --> 00:17:06,916
the ito process called W* given by
the expression as shown here

268
00:17:08,957 --> 00:17:13,546
becomes a Brownian motion under
the equivalent probability measure, Q,

269
00:17:14,518 --> 00:17:19,543
which is determined by the Radon-Nikodym
density process as shown here.

270
00:17:20,971 --> 00:17:23,950
This means if we are given
a Brownian motion

271
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:27,803
with a drift lambda dt
under the measure P

272
00:17:29,407 --> 00:17:31,578
we can de-trend 

273
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:36,756
by changing the probability measure
to an equivalent measure, Q,

274
00:17:37,666 --> 00:17:43,913
exactly when the Radon-Nikodym density
of Q with respect to P

275
00:17:44,113 --> 00:17:49,195
is given in terms of the drift lambda
in this way.

276
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:54,253
Here is a very important application
of the Girsanov theorem

277
00:17:54,453 --> 00:17:56,667
in financial modeling.

278
00:17:57,045 --> 00:17:59,182
It's the arbitrage pricing theorem.

279
00:18:02,701 --> 00:18:05,473
It states that any traded asset

280
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:09,632
with a positive price process
denoted by S

281
00:18:09,856 --> 00:18:14,114
must have a return as shown here.

282
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,630
That means the return is decomposed

283
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,045
into a drift component

284
00:18:21,251 --> 00:18:22,899
and a martingale component.

285
00:18:24,467 --> 00:18:28,117
The drift component models
the expected return

286
00:18:29,239 --> 00:18:35,650
Its rate is the sum
of the short rate r(t)

287
00:18:38,010 --> 00:18:42,491
plus a risk premium which is
of the form sigma times lambda.

288
00:18:45,013 --> 00:18:47,489
Sigma is the volatility of the return.

289
00:18:47,689 --> 00:18:51,810
the larger sigma,
the more risky the return is

290
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:56,170
and lambda is the so-called
market price of risk.

291
00:18:57,913 --> 00:19:01,874
In consequence,
the more risky the asset is

292
00:19:02,286 --> 00:19:04,393
ie, the larger sigma is,

293
00:19:05,175 --> 00:19:08,884
the larger is going to be
the excess expected rate of retun

294
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:11,483
over the risk-free short rate

295
00:19:11,709 --> 00:19:15,099
Recall that the short rate
is called the risk-free rate of return

296
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:17,955
because this is what
the investor would earn

297
00:19:18,155 --> 00:19:21,947
if he would simply invest
in the savings account.

298
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:31,215
We now see how
the Girsanov theorem comes into the play.

299
00:19:32,062 --> 00:19:36,130
We can rearrange the terms,
the excess expected rate of return,

300
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:40,884
and denote its part, as show here,

301
00:19:42,956 --> 00:19:46,377
what we see here is
the Brownian motion plus drift

302
00:19:48,072 --> 00:19:50,931
we use the equivalent
probability measure, Q,

303
00:19:51,126 --> 00:19:54,927
as shown on the previous slide
in Girsanov theorem

304
00:19:55,439 --> 00:19:56,679
where we learnt that

305
00:19:56,879 --> 00:20:02,832
this is a Brownian motion W*
under the equivalent measure, Q.

306
00:20:04,528 --> 00:20:08,423
We can re-express
the asset price return as follows.

307
00:20:08,945 --> 00:20:11,282
In terms of W*

308
00:20:12,639 --> 00:20:16,549
We now see that under
the equivalent measure, Q,

309
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:22,199
the expected rate of return
is the risk-free rate, r

310
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:26,156
while the volatility remains the same.

311
00:20:27,725 --> 00:20:30,725
We can thus re-state
the arbitrage pricing theorem

312
00:20:30,925 --> 00:20:35,641
by saying that there must exist
an equivalent measure, Q.

313
00:20:35,841 --> 00:20:39,131
which is called risk neutral-measure,

314
00:20:39,331 --> 00:20:43,892
under which the return
of any traded asset

315
00:20:44,092 --> 00:20:49,826
has an expected rate,
given by the risk-free short rate.

316
00:20:52,029 --> 00:20:55,229
Using the integration by parts
and ito formula

317
00:20:57,141 --> 00:21:00,790
we can show that
this differential notation

318
00:21:00,990 --> 00:21:06,670
is equivalent to what is shown here.

319
00:21:08,505 --> 00:21:10,664
It states two things.

320
00:21:10,864 --> 00:21:14,040
First, the discounted
asset price process

321
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,440
discounted by
the risk-free numeraire

322
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,939
the risk-free asset,
the savings account

323
00:21:21,594 --> 00:21:25,552
is a martingale
under the risk neutral-measure Q.

324
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:32,446
And second, this martingale is given 

325
00:21:32,646 --> 00:21:37,130
as stochastic exponential
of the martingale part

326
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:42,254
of the return of the price process.
