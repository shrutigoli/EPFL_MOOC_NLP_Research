1
00:00:06,717 --> 00:00:09,998
We have seen that 
by the Arbitrage pricing theory

2
00:00:10,217 --> 00:00:14,608
the bond price processes 
discounted by the savings account

3
00:00:14,835 --> 00:00:18,150
are martingales 
under the risk neutral measure.

4
00:00:18,443 --> 00:00:22,699
In this part 
we will now learn that

5
00:00:22,928 --> 00:00:28,703
if we discount bond price processes
by a specific T bond,

6
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:32,591
then this will give us 
martingales again

7
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,905
but under some equivalent measure,

8
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:38,582
that is called 
the T-forward measure.

9
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:41,912
This change of numeraire technique
proves most useful 

10
00:00:42,131 --> 00:00:44,881
for option pricing 
with stochastic interest rates.

11
00:00:45,093 --> 00:00:48,869
As an application, we will derive 
closed form formulas

12
00:00:49,067 --> 00:00:53,491
for options on bonds in the Gaussian
HJM model and framework.

13
00:00:53,987 --> 00:00:59,437
As a setup we consider
a filtered probability space

14
00:00:59,654 --> 00:01:02,216
with risk neutral measure Q
which is equivalent 

15
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:05,117
 to the real world measure P.

16
00:01:05,308 --> 00:01:09,821
On this stochastic basis 
we're given a short rate process

17
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:15,017
and the T-bond price processes 

18
00:01:16,698 --> 00:01:21,210
which are given by the arbitrage
pricing theory in this form. 

19
00:01:25,942 --> 00:01:31,504
such that the T-bond price process
discounted by the savings account

20
00:01:33,462 --> 00:01:37,987
is a martingale under 
the risk neutral measure Q

21
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:43,819
as becomes evident here.

22
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:48,850
Moreover this martingale 
is strictly positive

23
00:01:49,444 --> 00:01:55,094
so that after normalizing it
we can use it as a candidate

24
00:01:55,314 --> 00:02:00,490
for a Radon Nikodyn density process
for an equivalent measure.

25
00:02:02,801 --> 00:02:06,838
We call this measure 
the T-forward measure

26
00:02:07,097 --> 00:02:11,335
denoted by Q index T.

27
00:02:12,114 --> 00:02:17,076
It is equivalent to Q
with a Radon-Nikodyn density process

28
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:22,654
given by the normalised 
T-bond price process

29
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:26,036
discounted by the savings account.

30
00:02:27,501 --> 00:02:32,426
Normalising means that 
this martingale in expectation

31
00:02:32,614 --> 00:02:34,139
is equal to 1.

32
00:02:35,428 --> 00:02:40,141
The T-forward measure is defined
on a time horizon T.

33
00:02:42,428 --> 00:02:48,391
At this terminal time, 
the density is simply given

34
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:52,776
by the reciprocal 
of the savings account

35
00:02:52,963 --> 00:02:55,613
time the normalising factor.

36
00:02:56,694 --> 00:03:01,481
Here is an important application
in derivatives pricing.

37
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:09,040
Consider a claim that is due
at time capital T

38
00:03:09,946 --> 00:03:12,584
but suppose the pay off 
is given by X.

39
00:03:13,846 --> 00:03:16,471
The price at time small t

40
00:03:17,406 --> 00:03:22,144
is given by discounting the payoff X

41
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,087
with the savings account
and take the conditional expectation

42
00:03:27,337 --> 00:03:29,412
under the risk neutral measure Q.

43
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:37,061
The difficulty for computing 
this expectation

44
00:03:37,285 --> 00:03:41,284
comes from the fact 
that the argument

45
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:47,557
is product of the discount factor
times X

46
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:53,437
Using the T-forward measure
we can re-express this expectation

47
00:03:53,627 --> 00:03:57,089
of the product 
of the discount factor times X

48
00:03:57,267 --> 00:04:00,716
as expectation of X only

49
00:04:03,046 --> 00:04:06,120
The expectation is taken 
under the T-forward measure

50
00:04:07,113 --> 00:04:10,025
and the expectation 
has to be normalised

51
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:12,732
by the prevailing price 
of the T-bond.

52
00:04:14,008 --> 00:04:18,620
To equate these two sides
the Q conditional expectation

53
00:04:18,857 --> 00:04:21,920
and the QT conditional 
expectation of X

54
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:26,436
we use base rule as shown here.

55
00:04:28,537 --> 00:04:32,999
Here is a fundamental property
of the forward measures.

56
00:04:33,787 --> 00:04:39,912
For any time points T nought and T1,
the T nought bond price process

57
00:04:40,119 --> 00:04:46,631
discounted by the T1 bond
is a martingale

58
00:04:47,417 --> 00:04:49,992
under the T1 forward measure.

59
00:04:50,917 --> 00:04:54,580
Strictly speaking this martingale 
is only defined 

60
00:04:54,757 --> 00:05:00,932
up to the time which this is given
by the minimum of T nought and T1.

61
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:08,896
Again, this claim can be proved
using Bayes' rule

62
00:05:09,094 --> 00:05:12,082
as shown on this line here.

63
00:05:13,719 --> 00:05:17,056
As a consequence 
the simple forward rate

64
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:23,077
for the  future interval T-nought T1
follows a martingale

65
00:05:23,298 --> 00:05:25,698
under the T1 forward measure.

66
00:05:26,884 --> 00:05:32,121
This follows from the relation
between this forward rate

67
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:35,238
and the ratio 
of the T nought bond price

68
00:05:35,427 --> 00:05:37,815
divided by the T1 bond price.

69
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:42,855
Because it is a martingale,
it can be written 

70
00:05:43,105 --> 00:05:46,880
as a conditional expectation 
of it's terminal value

71
00:05:47,134 --> 00:05:48,972
 at time T nought

72
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:55,241
which is simply
the future simple spot rate.

73
00:05:57,023 --> 00:06:00,854
We can say more in a specific model.

74
00:06:01,584 --> 00:06:06,272
So let us consider 
the HJM model framework

75
00:06:06,453 --> 00:06:11,942
where the T-forward rate dynamics
under the risk neutral measure Q

76
00:06:12,337 --> 00:06:14,390
is given as shown here.

77
00:06:16,234 --> 00:06:20,071
This is simply rewriting
the HJM model drift 

78
00:06:20,285 --> 00:06:22,835
as we have seen it previously.

79
00:06:23,038 --> 00:06:27,975
Using the bond return volatility V
which is defined as

80
00:06:28,167 --> 00:06:33,204
as minus the integral of
the forward rate volatility Sigma.

81
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:38,607
In such a Heath-Jarrow Morton model,
we have also seen 

82
00:06:38,829 --> 00:06:41,779
that the discounted 
bond price process

83
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,275
can be written as stochastic 
exponential as shown here.

84
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,880
So we're given 
an explicit expression

85
00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:54,443
for the Radon Nikodyn density 
process of the T-forward measure

86
00:06:55,241 --> 00:06:59,178
in terms of the Brownian motion W*

87
00:06:59,379 --> 00:07:02,104
under the risk neutral measure Q.

88
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:08,109
We can then apply Girsanov theorem
that implies

89
00:07:08,882 --> 00:07:14,307
that under the T-forward measure
the process that we call 

90
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:20,712
W upper index capital T
which is defined as shown here

91
00:07:21,593 --> 00:07:24,144
is a Brownian motion.

92
00:07:25,524 --> 00:07:29,599
It then follows immediately
from this representation

93
00:07:29,835 --> 00:07:34,934
of the T-forward dynamics
that the T-forward rate process

94
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:38,764
is a martingale 
under the T-forward measure

95
00:07:40,401 --> 00:07:41,876
and there's a consequence.

96
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:44,858
It can be written 
as conditional expectation

97
00:07:45,046 --> 00:07:49,433
of it's terminal value 
which is just the future short rate

98
00:07:49,642 --> 00:07:51,605
at time capital T.

99
00:07:53,364 --> 00:07:59,763
Now let us look at the most basic 
option in the bond market.

100
00:08:01,938 --> 00:08:05,988
It is a European call option 
on the T1 bond

101
00:08:06,229 --> 00:08:10,266
with expiry date T nought 
and strike price K.

102
00:08:13,129 --> 00:08:16,879
This option gives the holder 
the right

103
00:08:17,092 --> 00:08:21,529
to buy a T1 bond 
at the expiry date T nought

104
00:08:21,778 --> 00:08:24,228
for the price K.

105
00:08:24,727 --> 00:08:27,702
The holder of the option 
will exercise the option 

106
00:08:27,926 --> 00:08:32,727
only if the T1 bond price 
at expiry date T nought

107
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:35,150
is not greater than K.

108
00:08:36,054 --> 00:08:40,042
As a consequence
the  payoff to the holder 

109
00:08:40,223 --> 00:08:45,149
of the European call option 
is given by the positive part

110
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:50,086
of the difference 
of the T1 bond price

111
00:08:51,509 --> 00:08:57,384
We obtain the price 
of this call option at the time 0

112
00:08:58,749 --> 00:09:03,936
by discounting the payoff 
with the savings account

113
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:09,214
and take the expectation 
under the risk neutral measure.

114
00:09:10,638 --> 00:09:16,900
We could compute this price for 
any time small t prior to T nought

115
00:09:17,119 --> 00:09:19,231
but for simplicity of notation

116
00:09:19,886 --> 00:09:24,710
we concentrate here 
on the spot date 0.

117
00:09:25,835 --> 00:09:29,373
We see again that the difficulty

118
00:09:29,573 --> 00:09:33,498
for computing this option price,

119
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:38,781
comes from the fact that the 
argument in the expression operator

120
00:09:38,976 --> 00:09:44,001
is the product of
the discount factor times the payoff

121
00:09:44,223 --> 00:09:48,810
which is a random variable
which is measurable 

122
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:51,230
with respect to FT nought.

123
00:09:52,202 --> 00:09:55,301
We could have seen 
on the previous slide

124
00:09:55,545 --> 00:09:59,758
get rate of the discount factor
by rewriting this expectation

125
00:09:59,956 --> 00:10:02,982
as an expectation under 
the T nought forward measure

126
00:10:03,923 --> 00:10:07,585
but we will do something 
smarter here.

127
00:10:08,766 --> 00:10:14,231
We denote in blue here the 
exercise event of the call option

128
00:10:14,452 --> 00:10:19,102
that is the centrefold states 
where the holder of the call option

129
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:21,129
will exercise the option.

130
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:24,396
This is exactly when 
the T1 bond price

131
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:28,666
is greater than the strike price K.

132
00:10:29,481 --> 00:10:32,669
We can then decompose 
the payoff of the call option

133
00:10:33,128 --> 00:10:36,665
into the difference 
of the T1 bond price

134
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:41,301
times the indicator function 
of the exercise event

135
00:10:41,538 --> 00:10:45,376
minus the strike price times 
the indicator function 

136
00:10:45,579 --> 00:10:48,004
of the exercise event.

137
00:10:48,561 --> 00:10:52,636
We then use the linearity 
of the expectation operator

138
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:56,599
and can write the call price 
as the difference

139
00:10:56,789 --> 00:11:01,314
of the expectations 
of the respective components.

140
00:11:02,827 --> 00:11:07,064
We then change to 
the T nought forward measure

141
00:11:07,287 --> 00:11:13,775
for the second expectation
to get rid of the discount factor

142
00:11:14,846 --> 00:11:17,396
as shown here

143
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:22,505
and we end up with the expectation 
of the indicator function 

144
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:26,544
of the exercise event
under the T nought forward measure

145
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:32,121
which is  simply the same as the
probability of the exercise event

146
00:11:32,349 --> 00:11:34,462
under the T nought forward measure.

147
00:11:35,244 --> 00:11:40,257
In the first expectation,
we observe that 

148
00:11:41,658 --> 00:11:45,120
this factor that I underline here,

149
00:11:45,342 --> 00:11:49,354
after normalisation 
with the initial T1 bond price,

150
00:11:50,207 --> 00:11:55,982
is the same as the Radon Nikodyn 
density of the T1 forward measure

151
00:11:56,438 --> 00:11:59,400
conditional on T nought. 

152
00:12:01,005 --> 00:12:06,904
This is just what we need
to apply base rule again

153
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:10,940
and re-express 
this first expectation now

154
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:16,803
as expectation of the indicator 
function of the exercise event

155
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:20,563
under the T1 forward measure
which is nothing else 

156
00:12:20,763 --> 00:12:24,363
than the probability 
of the exercise event

157
00:12:24,593 --> 00:12:26,968
under the T1 forward measure.

158
00:12:27,648 --> 00:12:32,098
As a result we summarise 

159
00:12:32,364 --> 00:12:34,527
that the call option price

160
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:41,351
of a T1 bond at expiry date
 T nought, can be expressed

161
00:12:41,956 --> 00:12:47,769
in terms of the probability 
of the exercise event

162
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:52,825
under the T1 forward measure
and the T nought forward measure.

163
00:12:53,302 --> 00:12:58,652
So in order to find 
a closed form formula,

164
00:12:59,452 --> 00:13:04,602
we have to formulate the model
for which we can compute 

165
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:08,856
these two probabilities 
in closed form.

166
00:13:09,313 --> 00:13:13,175
And this will be the case 
in particular for

167
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:16,473
Gaussian Heath-Jarrow-Morton models.

168
00:13:17,611 --> 00:13:22,024
As an intermediary step,
we observe

169
00:13:22,225 --> 00:13:26,588
that the probability 
of the exercise event 

170
00:13:26,803 --> 00:13:29,503
under the T1 forward measure,

171
00:13:29,718 --> 00:13:35,756
can be rewritten as probability
of an event 

172
00:13:37,142 --> 00:13:41,466
that is expressed in terms 
of the T nought bond price

173
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:44,724
discounted by the T1 bond price.

174
00:13:45,072 --> 00:13:49,672
Similarly, the probability 
of the exercise event

175
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:56,504
under the T nought forward measure
can be rewritten as probability

176
00:13:56,701 --> 00:13:59,976
under the T nought forward measure
of an event

177
00:14:00,163 --> 00:14:02,413
expressed in terms of 
the T1 bond price

178
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,190
divided by the T nought bond.

179
00:14:04,832 --> 00:14:10,469
This is a useful observation
because we know that

180
00:14:11,294 --> 00:14:15,757
bond price processes discounted 
by the T1 bond

181
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:19,241
are martingales under 
the T1 forward measure

182
00:14:19,874 --> 00:14:21,874
and similarly for T nought,

183
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:26,579
bond price processes 
discounted by the T nought bond

184
00:14:26,814 --> 00:14:29,626
are martingales under 
the T nought forward measure.

185
00:14:30,532 --> 00:14:35,969
That means in both cases
 we have here

186
00:14:36,188 --> 00:14:39,787
the terminal value of a martingale

187
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,425
under the respective 
forward measures.

188
00:14:43,224 --> 00:14:48,149
In the Heath-Jarrow-Morton framework
we can even  write down 

189
00:14:48,373 --> 00:14:51,398
how these martingale look like.

190
00:14:51,796 --> 00:14:55,896
The T nought bond price process
discounted by the T1 bond

191
00:14:56,122 --> 00:15:00,348
can be written explicitly
as a stochastic exponential

192
00:15:01,163 --> 00:15:05,589
of a stochastic integral
with respect to the  Brownian motion

193
00:15:05,785 --> 00:15:07,935
under the T1 forward measure.

194
00:15:09,848 --> 00:15:15,398
And this holds interchangeably 
for T nought and T1.

195
00:15:16,953 --> 00:15:20,015
Now in view  of these 
two identities, 

196
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:24,394
it should be clear that

197
00:15:24,592 --> 00:15:28,655
when the volatility 
is a deterministic function

198
00:15:29,610 --> 00:15:35,248
the stochastic exponential 
is a log normal, random variable.

199
00:15:35,917 --> 00:15:40,167
We can compute it's mean 
and it's variance

200
00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:44,577
and so we  will be able 
to compute this probability

201
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:46,474
in closed form.

202
00:15:47,055 --> 00:15:50,829
And similarly interchangeably 
T nought T1

203
00:15:51,467 --> 00:15:54,730
we will be able 
to compute this probability

204
00:15:55,655 --> 00:15:58,117
and here are the details.

205
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:04,080
Assume that the volatility Sigma 
is a deterministic function

206
00:16:05,747 --> 00:16:10,673
and so consequently 
the bond return volatility 

207
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:15,324
is also a deterministic function,
we can go back 

208
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:19,269
to the stochastic exponential
shown on the previous slide

209
00:16:19,466 --> 00:16:25,116
and take the logarithm 
which gives us this identity 

210
00:16:25,358 --> 00:16:27,333
as shown here.

211
00:16:28,745 --> 00:16:31,883
Because V 
is a deterministic function, 

212
00:16:32,858 --> 00:16:36,446
we know that
what we have on the right hand side

213
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,590
is a Gaussian process.

214
00:16:40,503 --> 00:16:45,591
The mean function is given 
as shown here

215
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,897
and the variance function
is given as shown here.

216
00:16:50,881 --> 00:16:56,906
Setting small t equal to T nought
and combining this insight

217
00:16:57,135 --> 00:17:03,072
with the previous slide,
we arrive at the following theory.

218
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:06,021
In a Gaussian Heath-Jarrow-Morton 
model,

219
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:08,504
that is a Heath-Jarrow-Morton 
model 

220
00:17:08,688 --> 00:17:11,651
with deterministic 
volatility function Sigma

221
00:17:11,861 --> 00:17:15,023
the time 0 price on 
a European call option

222
00:17:15,251 --> 00:17:19,339
on a T1 bond with expiry date 
T nought and strike price K

223
00:17:19,544 --> 00:17:23,344
is given by the difference 
of the T1 bond price

224
00:17:23,552 --> 00:17:26,490
times the probability
of the exercise event 

225
00:17:26,681 --> 00:17:30,706
under T1 forward measure 
minus strike K 

226
00:17:30,926 --> 00:17:33,988
times the T nought bond price
times the probability 

227
00:17:34,167 --> 00:17:37,554
of the exercise event 
under the T nought forward measure.

228
00:17:38,563 --> 00:17:42,000
These two probabilities 
can be written

229
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:46,735
as standard cumulative 
distribution function Phi

230
00:17:46,963 --> 00:17:51,363
evaluated at D1 and D2 respectively

231
00:17:51,544 --> 00:17:56,894
where these numbers are given
by the expression shown here.

232
00:17:57,918 --> 00:18:01,905
This is a closed form formula 
for the price 

233
00:18:02,069 --> 00:18:05,632
of a European call option on a bond.

234
00:18:07,194 --> 00:18:12,769
From it we can easily now infer
a price formula 

235
00:18:13,002 --> 00:18:16,152
for a European put option on a bond

236
00:18:17,077 --> 00:18:20,227
as shown in the following.

237
00:18:21,639 --> 00:18:27,551
The put call parity
relates call prices to put prices

238
00:18:27,729 --> 00:18:30,704
in a one to one relation.

239
00:18:31,956 --> 00:18:37,218
It derives from this 
elementary identity.

240
00:18:43,665 --> 00:18:47,665
Here is the payoff
 of a call option

241
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:54,982
and that is the payoff of
a put option with the same strike K.

242
00:18:55,894 --> 00:18:59,781
By linearity of the prices, 

243
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:03,953
we infer that the difference 
of the call price

244
00:19:04,162 --> 00:19:09,362
minus the put option price
is given by the present value

245
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:13,442
of what we have here 
on the right hand side

246
00:19:15,412 --> 00:19:18,512
which is simply the T1 bond price
at time 0

247
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,452
minus K times the T nought 
bond price at time 0.

248
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:28,804
We can solve the put call parity
for the put option price

249
00:19:30,019 --> 00:19:36,069
and plug in the call option price
from the previous slide

250
00:19:37,222 --> 00:19:41,835
to derive that the put option price
in the above

251
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:44,138
Gaussian Heath-Jarrow-Morton model

252
00:19:45,648 --> 00:19:49,460
is given by the expression here.

253
00:19:58,098 --> 00:20:03,773
From the put call parity we also see
that the put option price

254
00:20:04,018 --> 00:20:09,956
is equal to the call option price
for a specific strike price K

255
00:20:11,763 --> 00:20:15,963
given by the T1 bond price 
divided by the T nought bond

256
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:21,656
the strike price is called
the at the money strike price.

257
00:20:25,052 --> 00:20:28,389
As an example
let's look at a specific

258
00:20:28,616 --> 00:20:33,804
Gaussian Heath-Jarrow-Morton model
the Vasicek short rate model.

259
00:20:36,574 --> 00:20:41,698
We already know that the
forward rate volatility function

260
00:20:41,914 --> 00:20:44,989
is given as shown here.

261
00:20:46,873 --> 00:20:50,348
We can then explicitly compute
the difference between

262
00:20:50,561 --> 00:20:54,399
the volatility fn the return 
on the T nought bond

263
00:20:54,629 --> 00:21:00,455
minus the volatility of the return 
on the T1 bond as shown here

264
00:21:01,662 --> 00:21:06,625
such that the integrated square 
difference of these volatilities

265
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:08,987
is given as shown here.

266
00:21:09,964 --> 00:21:14,764
This is one ingredient 
of the Gaussian HJM model

267
00:21:14,987 --> 00:21:16,787
call option price formula

268
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:22,327
The other ingredient 
is the initial discount curve.

269
00:21:24,255 --> 00:21:27,517
We thus obtain an explicit 
closed form

270
00:21:27,766 --> 00:21:29,878
bond option price formula

271
00:21:30,074 --> 00:21:33,061
in the Vasicek short rate model.

272
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:39,945
For an illustration we choose 
the parameters as shown here

273
00:21:42,722 --> 00:21:48,085
For these parameters we compute
the put option prices

274
00:21:48,749 --> 00:21:54,412
on the Ti bond with expiry date 
Ti minus 1

275
00:21:54,608 --> 00:21:59,120
and the at the money strike price Ki
which is given 

276
00:21:59,358 --> 00:22:04,846
by the ratio of the Ti bond price
divided by the Ti bond price.

277
00:22:06,124 --> 00:22:09,675
We do this for a sequence 

278
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:14,713
of expiry dates and bond maturities

279
00:22:14,892 --> 00:22:20,729
going from one quarter of a year 
up to 10 years.

280
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:28,192
We obtain a term structure 
of put option prices 

281
00:22:28,385 --> 00:22:31,335
as shown in this graph here.

282
00:22:32,482 --> 00:22:38,895
The scale on the Y-axis 
is in basis points.

283
00:22:39,889 --> 00:22:43,639
This means the price

284
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:51,157
of a put option
on the one half year bond

285
00:22:51,892 --> 00:22:55,217
with the expiry date in 3 months,

286
00:22:55,672 --> 00:23:00,659
is slightly less 
than 4 bases points.
