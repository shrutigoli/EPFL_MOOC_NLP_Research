1
00:00:01,612 --> 00:00:03,949
We now have all the ingredients

2
00:00:04,147 --> 00:00:08,410
to calibrate an interest rate model
to market data. 

3
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,215
More specifically, we calibrate

4
00:00:12,434 --> 00:00:16,097
a two factor 
Gaussian Heath–Jarrow–Morton model

5
00:00:16,301 --> 00:00:20,113
to market data consisting
of swamp rates

6
00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:23,059
and at-the-money cap quotes.

7
00:00:23,255 --> 00:00:27,705
For that, we first derive 
pricing formulas for caps 

8
00:00:27,908 --> 00:00:30,220
in Gaussian HJM models. 

9
00:00:31,325 --> 00:00:34,924
And for the calibration, 
we need the appropriate function

10
00:00:35,127 --> 00:00:39,128
to be minimized, and we will see 
that a good choice 

11
00:00:39,328 --> 00:00:43,692
for weights of pricing errors
are the the vegas,

12
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:47,754
the derivatives of the Black 
and Bachelier prices

13
00:00:47,945 --> 00:00:51,158
with respect to their volatility. 

14
00:00:51,732 --> 00:00:54,770
Let us review the pricing of caps. 

15
00:00:55,943 --> 00:01:01,606
We consider a spot date t note
that we set to 0 for simplicity.

16
00:01:02,716 --> 00:01:06,967
We then consider a sequence
of reset and settlement dates

17
00:01:07,165 --> 00:01:13,903
T note, T1, up to Tn, and assume 
that they're all equidistant 

18
00:01:14,095 --> 00:01:17,521
with difference given by delta. 

19
00:01:18,004 --> 00:01:21,517
We're also given a cap rate kappa.

20
00:01:21,725 --> 00:01:26,763
Recall that the ith caplet
that resets the time Ti-1

21
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:30,539
and settles the time Ti 
is equivalent 

22
00:01:30,718 --> 00:01:36,481
to 1 plus delta k kappa 
times put option 

23
00:01:36,681 --> 00:01:41,631
on the Ti bond that expires 

24
00:01:41,839 --> 00:01:43,940
at time Ti-1 

25
00:01:45,627 --> 00:01:49,890
The price of the ith caplet 
therefore, is given by

26
00:01:50,082 --> 00:01:55,645
by the Q expectation 
of the discounted payoff

27
00:01:55,831 --> 00:01:59,293
of these put options on the Ti bond.

28
00:02:00,046 --> 00:02:03,771
Now suppose the underline model 
is a Gaussian HJM Model, 

29
00:02:03,969 --> 00:02:09,707
and recall the bond put option 
price formula in such models. 

30
00:02:09,928 --> 00:02:16,728
That gives us the prize 
of the ith caplet as shown here

31
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:20,335
where caplet Fi is to stand

32
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:23,347
normal cumulative 
distribution function.

33
00:02:23,524 --> 00:02:28,899
and the parameters d1 and d2 
are given  as shown here

34
00:02:29,118 --> 00:02:35,856
in terms of the integrated 
T-bond return volatility, v. 

35
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:41,378
Now consider more specifically
the following 

36
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:46,485
two-factor Gaussian HJM model
with the volatility specification 

37
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,162
as shown here 

38
00:02:49,552 --> 00:02:53,364
where v1, v2
beta 1 and beta 2 

39
00:02:53,565 --> 00:02:59,153
are real parameters to be calibrated
to cap market data. 

40
00:02:59,381 --> 00:03:02,894
Elementary integration shows us
that in this case, 

41
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:08,894
we obtain the following expression 
for the integrated volatility terms 

42
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:11,932
in the option price formula. 

43
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:17,301
We now want to calibrate these 
two factor Gaussian HJM model

44
00:03:17,524 --> 00:03:23,899
to swap and cap data 
given at the spot date, t note. 

45
00:03:24,727 --> 00:03:30,926
More specifically, the given data 
consists of spot swap rates

46
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:37,521
with swaps that pay 
annual fixed coupons 

47
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:41,190
and at-the-money cap quotes

48
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:46,508
where the caps 
have semi-annual cash flows.

49
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,150
The procedure is the following, 

50
00:03:49,376 --> 00:03:54,077
we first estimate the discount curve
from the swap data. 

51
00:03:55,875 --> 00:04:00,074
Second, we then calculate 
the forward swap rates

52
00:04:00,263 --> 00:04:02,888
with semi-annual fixed payments. 

53
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:07,915
These correspond 
to at-the-money cap rates.  

54
00:04:08,603 --> 00:04:14,091
And then third, we minimize
the weighted square cap prize errors

55
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:17,579
for calibrating 
the volatility parameters,

56
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:20,376
v1, v2, Beta 1, Beta 2. 

57
00:04:21,321 --> 00:04:23,333
Here is the swap data. 

58
00:04:24,004 --> 00:04:29,328
We have swaps paying 
fixed annual coupons

59
00:04:29,576 --> 00:04:34,750
with length ranging from 1 year
to 30 years. 

60
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:39,873
Swap rates are given in this column.

61
00:04:41,382 --> 00:04:47,657
The first quote is 
the 6th month simple spot rate.

62
00:04:49,445 --> 00:04:52,832
For the valuation of the caps
in the model, 

63
00:04:53,528 --> 00:04:59,015
we need the discount curve
at the semi-annual frequency. 

64
00:05:00,156 --> 00:05:04,056
We use the exact methods
based on the pseudoinverse 

65
00:05:04,277 --> 00:05:10,527
to estimate the weighted increments
of the discount curve. 

66
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:17,213
Delta, as shown here, 
the estimated discount rates 

67
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,595
are given in this table. 

68
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:24,640
We then compute 
from this distant curve 

69
00:05:24,822 --> 00:05:28,398
the 6th month forward swap rates 

70
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:34,577
whose first reset date 
is T note equal to one-half

71
00:05:34,815 --> 00:05:39,114
and that have semi-annual 
fixed payments 

72
00:05:39,596 --> 00:05:44,833
we derive these swap rates
from these well known formulas. 

73
00:05:45,771 --> 00:05:50,396
The figure on the right hand side
shows these forward swap rates 

74
00:05:50,584 --> 00:05:53,797
as function of their maturity

75
00:05:54,495 --> 00:05:58,720
which ranges from 1 year 
to 30 years. 

76
00:05:59,424 --> 00:06:04,211
These forward swap rates
dive us the at-the-money strikes

77
00:06:04,412 --> 00:06:08,649
of the corresponding caps
with maturities

78
00:06:08,842 --> 00:06:12,130
ranging from 1 to 30 years. 

79
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:20,633
The corresponding prizes of the caps
are given as nominal prices 

80
00:06:20,853 --> 00:06:25,590
and equivalently, in terms 
of their black implied volatilities

81
00:06:26,429 --> 00:06:29,966
and in terms of their 
normal implied volatilities.

82
00:06:31,322 --> 00:06:34,997
Recall that these caps 
have semi-annual cash flows. 

83
00:06:35,972 --> 00:06:41,060
The calibration problem now consists
in finding the remaining parameters

84
00:06:41,283 --> 00:06:45,883
v1, v2, Beta 1, Beta 2
that we summarize by theta

85
00:06:46,954 --> 00:06:51,091
such that the model cap prizes, 

86
00:06:52,292 --> 00:06:56,805
let me denote by C hat theta, 
n for the nth cap, 

87
00:06:57,027 --> 00:07:01,752
are as close as possible
to the market cap prices Cn

88
00:07:01,929 --> 00:07:04,829
shown on the previous slide. 

89
00:07:05,898 --> 00:07:10,548
We minimize the mean squared error
of the implied volatilities,

90
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:14,273
rather than of the nominal prices. 

91
00:07:15,465 --> 00:07:19,265
The reason is that the black 
and normal implied volatilities,

92
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:23,858
they standardize option prizes,
they're more robust overtime,

93
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:28,200
and better comparable 
across maturities and strikes.  

94
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:33,017
The problem is that 
computing implied volatilities

95
00:07:33,212 --> 00:07:38,487
involves numerical inversion 
of the Black or Bachelier formula

96
00:07:38,668 --> 00:07:43,643
at each minimization step
and that is computationally costly.

97
00:07:44,524 --> 00:07:49,762
Fortunately there is an easy way out
as shown on the following slide. 

98
00:07:51,173 --> 00:07:54,648
We make use of the vega,

99
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:58,633
the derivative  of the Black 
or Bachelier cap price, 

100
00:07:58,842 --> 00:08:01,580
with respect to the volatility. 

101
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:07,804
A first-order Taylor expansion 
of the black price function Cn

102
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,602
then, gives us this relation

103
00:08:14,187 --> 00:08:17,574
where sigma, hat, theta n

104
00:08:17,793 --> 00:08:21,005
denotes the model implied volatility

105
00:08:21,782 --> 00:08:25,595
and sigma n 
is the market implied volatility. 

106
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:31,597
We can then express the squared 
implied volatility error

107
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:36,709
as a weighted squared cap error
as shown here. 

108
00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:41,576
Now the good news is that
there exists a close form expression

109
00:08:41,773 --> 00:08:47,186
for the vega in the Black 
and the Bachelier model.

110
00:08:48,374 --> 00:08:51,337
Recall that the black price 
of the ith caplet

111
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:56,633
is given as shown here 
where caplet Fi

112
00:08:57,527 --> 00:09:03,515
denotes the standard normal 
cumulative distribution function 

113
00:09:03,730 --> 00:09:09,730
and the parameters d1 and d2
are given as shown here 

114
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:15,681
and we write Fi, 
short for the forward rate

115
00:09:15,869 --> 00:09:17,419
as shown there.

116
00:09:17,951 --> 00:09:21,476
Elementary calculus 
using this identity

117
00:09:21,665 --> 00:09:26,128
then, gives us 
the following expression

118
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:28,621
for the derivative 
of the caplet price

119
00:09:28,845 --> 00:09:33,045
with respect to the volatility 
parameter sigma, 

120
00:09:33,983 --> 00:09:37,270
the Black caplet vega. 

121
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:41,155
By linearity, 
the Black cap vega is then simply 

122
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:46,225
the sum of the Black caplet vegas 
as shown here. 

123
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:50,146
Similarly, we recall 
the Bachelier price formula

124
00:09:50,368 --> 00:09:54,531
for the ith caplet shown here

125
00:09:54,770 --> 00:09:58,545
where caplet Fi is again, 

126
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:01,887
the standard normal cumulative 
distribution function

127
00:10:02,095 --> 00:10:05,570
and small fi is the density. 

128
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:12,337
The parameter Di stands for this,

129
00:10:12,537 --> 00:10:18,037
where Fi is shorthand 
for the forward rate.

130
00:10:18,892 --> 00:10:23,067
Elementary calculus, again, 
using these identities

131
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:28,792
give us the following expression
for the derivative 

132
00:10:28,993 --> 00:10:35,080
of the Bachelier caplet price
with respect to the volatility, 

133
00:10:35,305 --> 00:10:37,780
the Bachelier caplet vega. 

134
00:10:38,486 --> 00:10:41,886
Linearity gives us 
the Bachelier cap vega 

135
00:10:42,102 --> 00:10:45,552
as the sum 
of the Bachelier caplet vegas.

136
00:10:46,536 --> 00:10:50,236
Using the Bachelier vegas, 
the calibration problem

137
00:10:50,451 --> 00:10:55,576
now boils down to the weighted 
least squared problem shown here.

138
00:10:56,487 --> 00:10:59,012
Using standard optimization 
libraries

139
00:10:59,238 --> 00:11:03,900
such as the Matlab built 
in fminsearch, 

140
00:11:04,099 --> 00:11:08,999
we find the following values 
for the parameters.

141
00:11:09,821 --> 00:11:13,709
We obtain similar results 
using Black vegas

142
00:11:13,937 --> 00:11:16,575
in stead of Bachelier vegas. 

143
00:11:16,807 --> 00:11:20,082
On this slide we see 
the fitted normal

144
00:11:20,283 --> 00:11:24,133
and Black implied volatility curves.

145
00:11:25,324 --> 00:11:31,087
In black, we have the market quotes

146
00:11:31,709 --> 00:11:35,734
and in red, 
the model implied volatilities.
