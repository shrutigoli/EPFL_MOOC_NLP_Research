Using stochastic interest rate models we can now price all interest rate derivatives.
In the sequel, we will focus on the standard derivatives, interest rate futures, caps and floors, and swaptions.
In this first part, we will recap the definition of an interest rate futures contract.
We will then derive a formula for the futures rates.
As we have seen earlier futures rates typically differ from forward rates.
The difference being called the convexity adjustment.
We will now calculate these convexity adjustments for Gaussian Heath-Jarrow-Morton models.
We will illustrate our results in the VasiÄ�ek model.
Let us recap what we have learned about interest rate futures.
Similar to a forward rate agreement an interest rate futures allows one to manage the exposure to the simple spot rate prevailing over a future period <i>(T-0, T-1)</i> with lengths that we denote by
Î´ in the following.
Recall that in contrast to forward rate agreements interest rate futures are daily marked to market.
The marking to market works as follows.
At any date <i>t</i> the futures price is quoted.
It is given in terms of the futures rate as shown here.
If the futures price changes from time <i>t</i> to time <i> t + Î”t the holder of the contract receives a cash flow which is given by the difference of the futures price.
At time <i>t+Î”t</i> minus the futures price from day <i>t we denote this cash flow by Î” x futures price <i>P</i> at
<i>t + Î”t.
This cash flow can be positive or negative.
The futures rate determining the futures price is chosen according to the following rules.
At the delivery date <i>T-0 the futures rate is equal to the underlying which in this case is the simple spot rate.
At any earlier date <i>t the present value of the cash flow from holding the futures contract has to be 0.
This is the present value of the cash flow and has to be 0.
We then approximate the discount factor for small Î”t by <i>e ^ - r(t)Î”t.
Because this is measurable with respect to the information available at <i>t</i>, we can pull this out from the expectation, and will be left with the conditional expectation of the cash flow itself.
We infer that the conditional expectation has to be 0.
But this just means that the futures price process is a martingale under Q.
Because the futures rate is linear in the futures price, we conclude that the futures rate process itself is a martingale under Q.
Hence the futures rate at any time <i>t is given by the conditional expectation under Q of its terminal value which is the future simple spot rate.
Now let us contrast this with what we know for the simple forward rates.
We recall that the forward rate process is a martingale under the <i>T-1</i> forward measure.
Hence at any date <i>t the simple forward rate is given by the conditional expectation of the future simple spot rate but under the <i>T-1</i> forward measure.
The difference between the futures rate and the forward rate is called the convexity adjustment.
We denote it by the letter Î³.
This value depends on the underlying interest rate model.
We now calculate the convexity adjustment in a Gaussian Heath-Jarrow-Morton model.
Consider a Gaussian HJM model with the deterministic forward rate volatility Ïƒ.
As usual, we denote the T-bond return volatility by the letter <i>v</i> which is minus the integral of Ïƒ.
Some stochastic calculus then shows that we can express the <i>T-0</i> bond price divided by the <i>T-1</i> bond price as shown here.
This is the product of a Q-martingale times a deterministic function of time.
From this we easily infer that the conditional expectation of the terminal value of this ration process shown here, is given by the ratio process itself at time <i>t</i> times this deterministic correction factor.
Notice that this identity holds because
<i>v</i> is a deterministic function.
Using this identity, we can now calculate the convexity adjustment as shown on the next slide.
The convexity adjustment Î³ is the difference between the futures rate minus the forward rate.
Using the identity from the previous slide we can calculate this conditional expectation.
Plugging that in and re arranging terms we arrive at this expression for the convexity adjustment in a Gaussian Heath-Jarrow-Morton model.
Notice that the convexity adjustment
Î³ is non negative if the exponent is non negative.
And this holds in particular if the cross products of the Ïƒ are non negative.
This is clearly the case in a 1 factor VasiÄ�ek short rate model.
Recall that the VasiÄ�ek short rate model is a Gaussian HJM model with this volatility function.
We now compute the convexity adjustment for the parameters as shown here for the futures and forward rates written on a 3 month simple spot rate.
The plot on the left hand side shows the convexity adjustment as a function of time to maturity.
We see in this example that the convexity adjustment is smaller than a basis point for times to maturity up to
5 years.
In the right figure we see the convexity adjustment as a function of varying volatility parameters Ïƒ.
Here we fix the time to maturity to be 6 months and we vary the volatility Ïƒ from 0 to 2%.
As we can see, the convexity adjustment is increasing in Ïƒ and the order of magnitude is again somewhere between 0 and
1 basis point.
