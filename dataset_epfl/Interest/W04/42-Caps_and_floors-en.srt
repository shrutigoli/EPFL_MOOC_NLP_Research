1
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:10,062
If you have issued the floating rate
note and have to pay floating rates

2
00:00:10,515 --> 00:00:13,815
you'll want to protect yourself
against too high rates.

3
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:18,264
In this case, you would buy
a so called cap.

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,090
On the other hand, if you invested
in a floating rate note

5
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,965
and receive floating rates,

6
00:00:27,165 --> 00:00:30,552
you'll want to protect yourself
against too low rates.

7
00:00:31,253 --> 00:00:35,103
In this case, you'll want to buy
a so called floor.

8
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:40,426
Caps and floors are like 
calls and puts

9
00:00:40,626 --> 00:00:44,726
and they are related through a
parity relation

10
00:00:44,926 --> 00:00:49,026
which relates them to the value
of a corresponding swap.

11
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:52,038
We will price caps and floors using
the forward measures 

12
00:00:52,238 --> 00:00:54,300
developed in the previous part.

13
00:00:54,601 --> 00:01:00,276
We will learn about the so called
Black's and Bachelier's price formulas.

14
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:07,191
Both formula's express caps and
floor prices

15
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:10,391
in terms of a single volatility
parameter

16
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:13,854
which is in 1-1 relation 
to these prices.

17
00:01:14,066 --> 00:01:17,391
It is market practice to quote
caps and floors

18
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:20,166
in terms of their implied 
volatilities.

19
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:31,718
A caplet with reset date <i>T-0</i>
and settlement date <i>T-1</i>

20
00:01:32,018 --> 00:01:36,305
pays the holder the difference
between the simple spot rate

21
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:41,106
and the strike rate <i>κ.

22
00:01:44,089 --> 00:01:47,514
Specifically, the cash flow at
time <i>T-1

23
00:01:47,714 --> 00:01:51,889
is δ times the positive part

24
00:01:52,089 --> 00:01:56,126
of the difference between the
simple spot rate

25
00:01:56,326 --> 00:01:59,326
and the strike rate <i>κ.

26
00:02:00,035 --> 00:02:02,673
Formally, this is as shown here.

27
00:02:03,282 --> 00:02:08,957
We denote by δ, the length of the
time interval <I>(T-0, T-1).

28
00:02:09,977 --> 00:02:16,065
It is clear that the caplet protects
the holder against too high rates.

29
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:26,069
What is the price of this caplet at
some spot date <i>t.

30
00:02:26,766 --> 00:02:28,953
Let us do it in 2 steps.

31
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:35,401
We first observe that the pay off
of the caplet at time <i>T-1

32
00:02:35,885 --> 00:02:38,435
is known at time <i>T-0.

33
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:43,896
We can thus infer the time <i>T-0</i>
value of the caplet

34
00:02:44,183 --> 00:02:49,646
by simply multiplying the cash flow
by the <i>T-1</i> bond price.

35
00:02:51,016 --> 00:02:55,466
We can express the simple
spot rate

36
00:02:55,928 --> 00:02:58,153
in terms of the <i>T-1</i> 
bond price

37
00:03:00,007 --> 00:03:02,107
and rearranging terms

38
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:06,099
brings us to this identity as shown
here.

39
00:03:07,703 --> 00:03:12,366
Notice that this is factor
1 + δκ

40
00:03:13,111 --> 00:03:16,111
times the pay off of a put
option

41
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:20,776
on the <i>T-1</i> bond with expiry
date <i>T-0</i>

42
00:03:20,976 --> 00:03:24,963
and strike price over 1 + δκ.

43
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:30,004
This is the value at time <i>T-0.

44
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:34,910
The time <i>t</i> price of the 
caplet therefore is

45
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:42,309
the price of this put times the
factor 1 + δκ.

46
00:03:46,334 --> 00:03:51,996
We denote the price of the caplet
like this.

47
00:03:54,531 --> 00:03:57,456
A cap is a strip of caplets.

48
00:03:57,953 --> 00:04:02,353
It is specified by a sequence of 
reset and settlement dates

49
00:04:02,553 --> 00:04:05,003
<i>T-0</i> up to <i>T-n</i>.

50
00:04:06,104 --> 00:04:08,742
Here <i>T-0</i> is the first reset date

51
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:12,192
and <i>T-n</i> is called the maturity
of the cap.

52
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:16,928
It is further specified by a cap
rate κ

53
00:04:18,203 --> 00:04:20,691
and for simplicity of notation

54
00:04:20,891 --> 00:04:25,728
we assume that the length of these
intervals is equal to δ.

55
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:32,803
At the first reset date <i>T-0</i>, we
reset the first caplet

56
00:04:33,317 --> 00:04:36,204
which yields a cash flow at 
time <i>T-1.

57
00:04:36,855 --> 00:04:41,918
Same then at <i>T-1</i>, we reset the
cash flow of a caplet

58
00:04:42,118 --> 00:04:45,993
that pays at <i>T-2</i>, and so on
and so forth.

59
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:51,143
These payments are random and
can sometimes be 0.

60
00:04:52,486 --> 00:04:54,536
By linearity of prices

61
00:04:55,197 --> 00:04:58,885
the cap price at the spot date <i>t

62
00:04:59,362 --> 00:05:05,112
is given by the sum of the prices
of the corresponding caplets.

63
00:05:08,194 --> 00:05:11,069
A floor is the converse to a cap.

64
00:05:11,346 --> 00:05:15,221
It protects the holder against
low interest rates.

65
00:05:16,585 --> 00:05:21,035
It is defined as a strip of
floorlets

66
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,800
with cash flows at time <i>T-i

67
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
given by the positive part

68
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,687
of the difference of 
the strike rate κ

69
00:05:30,887 --> 00:05:35,024
minus the prevailing simple spot
rate.

70
00:05:37,852 --> 00:05:42,077
Again at the first reset date <i>T-0</i>,
there we set the first floorlet

71
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:46,925
which yields a cash flow 
at time <i>T-1

72
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:49,137
and so on and so forth.

73
00:05:49,337 --> 00:05:53,325
Again these cash flows can be
positive or 0

74
00:05:53,988 --> 00:05:58,751
depending on whether the prevailing
simple spot rate

75
00:05:58,951 --> 00:06:02,263
lies above or below 
the strike rate κ.

76
00:06:03,278 --> 00:06:07,666
By the linearity of prices, 
the price of the floor

77
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:14,753
at the spot date <i>t</i>  is given
by the sum of the 

78
00:06:22,717 --> 00:06:26,667
Let us observe the following parity
relation

79
00:06:27,486 --> 00:06:31,311
which holds for the difference for
the caplet 

80
00:06:31,511 --> 00:06:34,223
minus the floorlet pay off.

81
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:40,402
It is simply equal to the cash flow
of a prayer swap.

82
00:06:41,954 --> 00:06:46,292
This proves the following parity
relation

83
00:06:47,955 --> 00:06:51,555
Here is the cap, floor, 
parity relation.

84
00:06:54,347 --> 00:06:57,797
The price of the cap minus the price
of the floor

85
00:06:57,997 --> 00:07:01,960
is equal to the value of
a payer swap

86
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:06,653
with fixed rate, notional 1 and the
same

87
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:13,720
reset and settlement date 
as the cap an the floor.

88
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:19,764
We then say that the cap and
the floor

89
00:07:19,964 --> 00:07:26,226
are at the money if their
values are the same.

90
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:32,041
This happens exactly when the strike
rate κ

91
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:36,141
is equal to the prevailing swap rate

92
00:07:37,974 --> 00:07:42,111
which renders the value of the
payer swap equal to 0.

93
00:07:42,961 --> 00:07:45,161
The cap is then said to be in the
money

94
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:49,202
if the strike rate is smaller than
the swap rate

95
00:07:49,712 --> 00:07:54,075
and out of the money if the strike
rate is larger than the swap rate.

96
00:07:55,564 --> 00:07:58,564
For the floor, it's just 
the converse.

97
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:06,105
We now derive 2 price formulas
for caps and floors.

98
00:08:06,968 --> 00:08:09,193
We start with Black's formula.

99
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:15,333
Let us first look at these
generic price formulas.

100
00:08:18,174 --> 00:08:21,849
We know that the present value

101
00:08:22,049 --> 00:08:25,861
of a cash flow that takes
place at time <i>T-i</i>

102
00:08:26,683 --> 00:08:32,346
is computed by taking the
expectation

103
00:08:32,994 --> 00:08:36,344
of the pay off under the <i>T-i</i>
forward measure

104
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,234
and multiplied by the prevailing
<i>T-i</i> bond price.

105
00:08:41,815 --> 00:08:44,752
So in order to compute caplet
and floorlet prices

106
00:08:45,157 --> 00:08:49,194
we need to know the distribution
of this future

107
00:08:49,513 --> 00:08:54,163
simple spot rate under the <i>T-i</i>
forward measure.

108
00:08:55,153 --> 00:09:00,028
Black's formula assumes that this
distribution is log-normal.

109
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:02,799
More specifically

110
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:08,678
it is assumed that the forward
rate process

111
00:09:08,878 --> 00:09:13,878
follows these dynamics with the
constant σ.

112
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:20,093
Recall that we know that the forward
rate process

113
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:23,455
is a martingale under the <i>T-i</i>
forward measure.

114
00:09:24,008 --> 00:09:27,033
So Black's formula simply assumes
that this martingale

115
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:29,320
has very specific dynamics.

116
00:09:29,982 --> 00:09:31,132
This one.

117
00:09:32,002 --> 00:09:34,289
Under this log-normality assumptions

118
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:38,039
we know how to compute these
expectations.

119
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:43,686
This is bringing us to the
following theorem.

120
00:09:44,649 --> 00:09:48,449
Black's formula for the <i>i</i>th
caplet and floorlet price

121
00:09:48,649 --> 00:09:50,986
is as shown here.

122
00:09:54,152 --> 00:09:58,077
Where the ingredients are Φ

123
00:09:58,345 --> 00:10:02,620
which stands for the standard normal
cumulative distributive function

124
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:07,626
and the parameters <i>d-1</i>
and <i>d-2</i>

125
00:10:07,826 --> 00:10:12,714
which are expressed in terms
of σ.

126
00:10:15,447 --> 00:10:19,259
This is the single volatility
parameter

127
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:21,534
in Black's formula

128
00:10:22,216 --> 00:10:26,278
and hence is called, the
Black volatility.

129
00:10:28,725 --> 00:10:33,037
it is also called the 
relative volatility alternatively.

130
00:10:33,587 --> 00:10:36,162
Recall that the cap is a strip of
caplets

131
00:10:36,362 --> 00:10:40,162
and the price of the cap is the
sum of the caplet prices.

132
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:45,079
So it is important to know that

133
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,520
the Black volatility for the cap
price

134
00:10:49,957 --> 00:10:56,007
has to be one and the same for all
the caplets that belong to the cap.

135
00:10:57,133 --> 00:10:59,958
The same holds for the floor.

136
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:09,187
Bachelier's formula assumes that the
future simple spot rate

137
00:11:09,554 --> 00:11:14,054
is normally distributed under the
<i>T-i</i> forward measure.

138
00:11:16,124 --> 00:11:17,999
More specifically

139
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,554
it is assumed that the forward rate
process

140
00:11:22,011 --> 00:11:27,049
follows a Gaussian process with a
constant volatility σ

141
00:11:27,365 --> 00:11:29,365
under the <i>T-i</i> forward 
measure.

142
00:11:30,551 --> 00:11:33,913
This brings us to the next theorem.

143
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:40,204
Bachelier's formula for the <i>i</i>th
caplet and floorlet price

144
00:11:40,404 --> 00:11:42,516
is as shown here.

145
00:11:43,268 --> 00:11:46,881
Where the ingredients are Φ

146
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,718
the standard cumulative normal
distribution function,

147
00:11:51,009 --> 00:11:54,271
φ is the density,

148
00:11:55,975 --> 00:12:00,500
and <i>D</i> is the parameter 
shown here.

149
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:07,500
Again this is expressed in terms of
the single volatility parameter σ

150
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:12,969
which is called the normal 
volatility.

151
00:12:13,169 --> 00:12:16,169
Alternatively it is also called the
basis point volatility

152
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,744
or the absolute volatility.

153
00:12:20,491 --> 00:12:24,191
Again as it was the case for the
Black's formula,

154
00:12:25,149 --> 00:12:30,212
the normal volatility is going to be
the same for all caplets

155
00:12:30,412 --> 00:12:35,212
belonging to a cap and similarly
for the floor.

156
00:12:36,294 --> 00:12:40,531
With this convention, there is a 1-1
relation

157
00:12:40,935 --> 00:12:45,885
between the Black and the normal
volatilities

158
00:12:46,085 --> 00:12:48,473
and the cap and floor prices.

159
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:54,763
It is market practice to quote cap
and floor prices

160
00:12:54,963 --> 00:13:00,213
in terms of their implied Black or
normal volatilities.

161
00:13:01,986 --> 00:13:06,936
Caps and floors are typically traded
on 3 months

162
00:13:07,507 --> 00:13:11,119
simple spot rates in the US market

163
00:13:11,319 --> 00:13:15,844
and on 6 months simple spot rates
in the Euro market.

164
00:13:17,545 --> 00:13:20,995
Here is an example.

165
00:13:21,195 --> 00:13:25,320
These are at the money cap
prices

166
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:31,664
in the Euro-zone from August 2013.

167
00:13:33,206 --> 00:13:36,606
We see that maturities range

168
00:13:37,334 --> 00:13:39,771
up to 30 years.

169
00:13:41,485 --> 00:13:45,810
The first column gives us the cap
prices in percentage points.

170
00:13:47,870 --> 00:13:52,070
The second column shows the Black
implied volatilities

171
00:13:54,390 --> 00:13:57,677
and the third column shows us the
normal implied volatilities.

172
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:04,278
Notice that the normal implied
volatilities

173
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:09,033
are of an order 100th factor
100 smaller than

174
00:14:09,593 --> 00:14:11,706
the Black implied volatilities.

175
00:14:12,606 --> 00:14:15,606
The plot on the right hand side
shows

176
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:21,656
the implied volatilities as functions
of the maturity of the underlying cap.

177
00:14:22,594 --> 00:14:25,407
It is a challenge for any interest
rate model

178
00:14:25,607 --> 00:14:28,894
to match these given volatility
curves.
