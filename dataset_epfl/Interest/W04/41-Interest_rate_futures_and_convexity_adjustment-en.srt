1
00:00:05,683 --> 00:00:07,833
Using stochastic interest rate
models

2
00:00:08,008 --> 00:00:11,521
we can now price all interest rate
derivatives.

3
00:00:13,624 --> 00:00:17,624
In the sequel, we will focus on the
standard derivatives,

4
00:00:18,350 --> 00:00:22,525
interest rate futures, caps and 
floors, and swaptions.

5
00:00:26,477 --> 00:00:29,715
In this first part, we will recap

6
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:33,317
the definition of an interest
rate futures contract.

7
00:00:35,147 --> 00:00:39,347
We will then derive a formula
for the futures rates.

8
00:00:42,015 --> 00:00:43,528
As we have seen earlier

9
00:00:43,996 --> 00:00:47,958
futures rates typically differ from
forward rates.

10
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:52,008
The difference being called
the convexity adjustment.

11
00:00:53,529 --> 00:00:57,091
We will now calculate these
convexity adjustments

12
00:00:57,411 --> 00:01:00,211
for Gaussian Heath-Jarrow-Morton
models.

13
00:01:01,217 --> 00:01:05,829
We will illustrate our results in
the Vasiček model.

14
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:11,232
Let us recap what we have learned
about interest rate futures.

15
00:01:12,984 --> 00:01:15,434
Similar to a forward rate
agreement

16
00:01:15,634 --> 00:01:20,059
an interest rate futures allows one
to manage the exposure

17
00:01:20,259 --> 00:01:27,097
to the simple spot rate prevailing
over a future period <i>(T-0, T-1)</i>

18
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:30,884
with lengths that we denote by
δ in the following.

19
00:01:31,419 --> 00:01:34,244
Recall that in contrast to forward
rate agreements

20
00:01:34,444 --> 00:01:37,731
interest rate futures are daily
marked to market.

21
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:40,694
The marking to market works
as follows.

22
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:45,719
At any date <i>t</i> the futures 
price is quoted.

23
00:01:46,125 --> 00:01:49,750
It is given in terms of the futures
rate

24
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:52,232
as shown here.

25
00:01:53,072 --> 00:01:59,010
If the futures price changes from
time <i>t</i> to time <i> t + Δt

26
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:05,630
the holder of the contract receives
a cash flow

27
00:02:05,987 --> 00:02:09,824
which is given by the difference of
the futures price.

28
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:16,455
At time <i>t+Δt</i> minus the
futures price from day <i>t

29
00:02:17,393 --> 00:02:20,293
we denote this cash flow

30
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:26,547
by Δ x futures price <i>P</i> at
<i>t + Δt.

31
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:30,143
This cash flow can be positive
or negative.

32
00:02:31,093 --> 00:02:35,293
The futures rate determining
the futures price

33
00:02:35,997 --> 00:02:39,597
is chosen according to the following
rules.

34
00:02:42,189 --> 00:02:44,977
At the delivery date <i>T-0

35
00:02:45,701 --> 00:02:49,213
the futures rate is equal to the
underlying

36
00:02:49,413 --> 00:02:54,176
which in this case is the simple
spot rate.

37
00:02:56,738 --> 00:02:59,188
At any earlier date <i>t

38
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:03,770
the present value of the cash flow

39
00:03:06,008 --> 00:03:09,383
from holding the futures contract
has to be 0.

40
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:14,075
This is the present value
of the cash flow

41
00:03:14,823 --> 00:03:16,173
and has to be 0.

42
00:03:17,005 --> 00:03:20,043
We then approximate the discount
factor

43
00:03:21,637 --> 00:03:23,424
for small Δt

44
00:03:24,571 --> 00:03:27,921
by <i>e ^ - r(t)Δt.

45
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:32,523
Because this is measurable with
respect to the information

46
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:36,127
available at <i>t</i>,
we can pull this out

47
00:03:36,327 --> 00:03:41,527
from the expectation, and will be
left with the conditional expectation

48
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:43,264
of the cash flow itself.

49
00:03:44,068 --> 00:03:47,843
We infer that the conditional
expectation has to be 0.

50
00:03:49,012 --> 00:03:52,450
But this just means that the futures
price process

51
00:03:53,415 --> 00:03:55,828
is a martingale under Q.

52
00:03:56,731 --> 00:04:02,806
Because the futures rate is linear
in the futures price,

53
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:10,175
we conclude that the futures rate 
process itself is a martingale under Q.

54
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:15,747
Hence the futures rate 
at any time <i>t

55
00:04:15,947 --> 00:04:19,810
is given by the conditional
expectation under Q

56
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:21,947
of its terminal value

57
00:04:23,652 --> 00:04:27,014
which is the future simple 
spot rate.

58
00:04:27,994 --> 00:04:33,894
Now let us contrast this with what we
know for the simple forward rates.

59
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:39,286
We recall that the forward rate
process

60
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:42,997
is a martingale under the <i>T-1</i>
forward measure.

61
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,453
Hence at any date <i>t

62
00:04:46,991 --> 00:04:51,653
the simple forward rate is given
by the conditional expectation

63
00:04:51,853 --> 00:04:56,766
of the future simple spot rate but
under the <i>T-1</i> forward measure.

64
00:04:57,694 --> 00:05:02,056
The difference between the futures
rate and the forward rate

65
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,925
is called the convexity adjustment.

66
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,369
We denote it by the letter γ.

67
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:12,570
This value depends on the
underlying interest rate model.

68
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,088
We now calculate the convexity
adjustment

69
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:20,201
in a Gaussian Heath-Jarrow-Morton
model.

70
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,097
Consider a Gaussian HJM model

71
00:05:24,297 --> 00:05:27,635
with the deterministic forward rate
volatility σ.

72
00:05:28,986 --> 00:05:32,986
As usual, we denote the T-bond
return volatility

73
00:05:33,186 --> 00:05:39,049
by the letter <i>v</i> which is
minus the integral of σ.

74
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:44,973
Some stochastic calculus then shows
that we can express

75
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:49,335
the <i>T-0</i> bond price divided
by the <i>T-1</i> bond price

76
00:05:50,227 --> 00:05:52,127
as shown here.

77
00:05:54,203 --> 00:05:57,966
This is the product of a Q-martingale

78
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:03,796
times a deterministic function
of time.

79
00:06:07,401 --> 00:06:12,426
From this we easily infer
that the conditional expectation

80
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:15,626
of the terminal value of this
ration process

81
00:06:16,902 --> 00:06:20,352
shown here, is given by

82
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,850
the ratio process itself 
at time <i>t</i> times 

83
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:27,138
this deterministic correction
factor.

84
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:31,742
Notice that this identity 
holds because

85
00:06:31,942 --> 00:06:34,230
<i>v</i> is a deterministic 
function.

86
00:06:35,552 --> 00:06:40,277
Using this identity, we can now
calculate the convexity adjustment

87
00:06:40,477 --> 00:06:43,127
as shown on the next slide.

88
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,155
The convexity adjustment γ

89
00:06:46,355 --> 00:06:50,043
is the difference between the
futures rate

90
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:53,478
minus the forward rate.

91
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:57,048
Using the identity from the previous
slide

92
00:06:57,437 --> 00:07:01,050
we can calculate this conditional
expectation.

93
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:05,030
Plugging that in and re arranging
terms

94
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:10,430
we arrive at this expression for
the convexity adjustment

95
00:07:11,068 --> 00:07:14,655
in a Gaussian Heath-Jarrow-Morton
model.

96
00:07:15,637 --> 00:07:20,224
Notice that the convexity adjustment
γ is non negative

97
00:07:20,612 --> 00:07:22,725
if the exponent

98
00:07:24,404 --> 00:07:26,029
is non negative.

99
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:29,980
And this holds in particular if
the cross products

100
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,780
of the σ are non negative.

101
00:07:35,195 --> 00:07:37,170
This is clearly the case

102
00:07:37,474 --> 00:07:40,349
in a 1 factor Vasiček short
rate model.

103
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:44,485
Recall that the Vasiček short
rate model is

104
00:07:44,685 --> 00:07:49,910
a Gaussian HJM model with
this volatility function.

105
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,237
We now compute the convexity
adjustment 

106
00:07:53,437 --> 00:07:55,987
for the parameters as shown here

107
00:07:59,315 --> 00:08:03,277
for the futures and forward rates
written

108
00:08:03,477 --> 00:08:06,727
on a 3 month simple
spot rate.

109
00:08:08,014 --> 00:08:12,077
The plot on the left hand side
shows the convexity adjustment

110
00:08:12,277 --> 00:08:14,777
as a function of time to maturity.

111
00:08:16,703 --> 00:08:19,378
We see in this example that

112
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:24,839
the convexity adjustment is
smaller than a basis point

113
00:08:25,275 --> 00:08:28,563
for times to maturity up to
5 years.

114
00:08:30,288 --> 00:08:35,038
In the right figure we see the
convexity adjustment as a function

115
00:08:35,238 --> 00:08:38,238
of varying volatility parameters σ.

116
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:43,083
Here we fix the time to 
maturity to be 6 months

117
00:08:44,229 --> 00:08:46,466
and we vary the volatility σ

118
00:08:49,203 --> 00:08:52,016
from 0 to 2%.

119
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:57,391
As we can see, the convexity
adjustment is increasing in σ

120
00:08:58,275 --> 00:09:02,150
and the order of magnitude is

121
00:09:02,535 --> 00:09:06,785
again somewhere between 0 and
1 basis point.
