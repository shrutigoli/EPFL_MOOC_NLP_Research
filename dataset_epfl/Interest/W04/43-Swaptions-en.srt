1
00:00:05,207 --> 00:00:06,407
In this part

2
00:00:06,607 --> 00:00:10,644
we introduce options on swaps,
so called swaptions.

3
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:14,211
We study the notion of moneyness.

4
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:15,611
We see when there's a swaption 

5
00:00:15,811 --> 00:00:18,761
at money, out of the money, 
and in the money.

6
00:00:19,258 --> 00:00:21,845
We will also see how swaptions 
can be used 

7
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:25,045
to synthetically create
callable bonds.

8
00:00:26,003 --> 00:00:29,978
We will review Black's and 
Bachelier's price formulas

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:35,850
and finally see how swaptions
are quoted in terms

10
00:00:36,198 --> 00:00:39,998
of their Black and Bachelier
implied volatilities.

11
00:00:46,026 --> 00:00:49,088
A payer swaption with strike 
rate <i>K</i>

12
00:00:49,476 --> 00:00:55,001
gives the holder the right to enter
a payer swap with fixed rate <i>K</i>

13
00:00:55,201 --> 00:00:57,601
at the swaption expiry date.

14
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:02,986
Usually the swaption expiry date equals
the first reset date

15
00:01:03,186 --> 00:01:05,586
<i>T-0</i> of the underlying swap.

16
00:01:06,409 --> 00:01:09,121
Well let us assume that 
<i>T-0</i> is here 

17
00:01:09,321 --> 00:01:12,821
and the swap has a length of 
<i>T-n</i> - <i>T-0</i>.

18
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,070
It pays a fixed rate <i>K</i>.

19
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:23,003
at cash flow dates, and it receives
floating at the same dates.

20
00:01:24,686 --> 00:01:29,661
This leads to a value of this swap
at time <i>T-0</i>

21
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:33,236
that can be positive or negative.

22
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:38,480
You will exercise the swaption at
expiry date <i>T-0</i>

23
00:01:38,991 --> 00:01:42,166
only if this value is positive.

24
00:01:42,988 --> 00:01:46,112
So let us have a closer look 
at the payer swaption 

25
00:01:46,312 --> 00:01:48,912
pay off at expiry date <i>T-0</i>.

26
00:01:49,375 --> 00:01:52,987
The value of the payer swap is
shown here

27
00:01:53,518 --> 00:01:55,968
without the plus sign.

28
00:01:56,313 --> 00:01:59,175
The holder of the swaption
will only exercise

29
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:03,673
the option to enter the payer swap
if this value is positive,

30
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:04,960
hence

31
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:10,436
the payer swaption pay off is the
positive part of this value.

32
00:02:11,007 --> 00:02:14,181
Now notice that this pay off 
cannot be decomposed

33
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:16,694
 into more elementary pay offs.

34
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:20,941
As was the case for caps
and floors.

35
00:02:22,014 --> 00:02:25,752
This is because the positive part
of the sum

36
00:02:25,952 --> 00:02:29,877
is not the same as the sum of
the positive parts.

37
00:02:30,552 --> 00:02:33,764
From this we saw that the dependence
between

38
00:02:33,939 --> 00:02:36,426
the different forward rates 
will enter 

39
00:02:36,626 --> 00:02:39,826
the valuation procedure 
of a swaption.

40
00:02:40,668 --> 00:02:43,280
Now recall that an equivalent 
expression 

41
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:45,555
for the value of the payer swap

42
00:02:45,893 --> 00:02:49,193
is given in terms of the swap rate

43
00:02:49,393 --> 00:02:52,843
which is shown here without
a plus sign.

44
00:02:53,929 --> 00:02:57,278
Hence an equivalent expression for
the payer swaption pay off

45
00:02:57,465 --> 00:02:58,928
at expiry date <i>T-0</i>

46
00:02:59,241 --> 00:03:02,691
is what is shown here with
the plus sign.

47
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:06,433
This leads us to the following
convention.

48
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,408
We say a payer swaption is 
at the money

49
00:03:10,712 --> 00:03:16,237
if the strike rate is equal to the
prevailing forward swap rate.

50
00:03:17,053 --> 00:03:19,840
The payer swaption is said to be
in the money

51
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:23,040
if the strike rate is smaller than
this forward swap rate

52
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,853
and out of the money if the strike
rate is larger than the forward swap rate.

53
00:03:29,907 --> 00:03:33,107
For the receiver swaption it is
the converse.

54
00:03:33,871 --> 00:03:35,496
There is also the convention

55
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:41,642
to call the swaption that has expiry
in <i>X</i> years

56
00:03:41,842 --> 00:03:45,380
and an underlying swap length
of <i>Y</i> years

57
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:49,191
the <i>X</i> year into <i>Y</i> year
swaption.

58
00:03:50,284 --> 00:03:51,934
Here is an application.

59
00:03:52,928 --> 00:03:56,928
Swaptions can be used to synthetically
create callable bonds.

60
00:03:57,647 --> 00:04:00,484
Let's illustrate that with
an example.

61
00:04:01,604 --> 00:04:07,329
Suppose a company has issued a 10
year bond with a 4% annual coupon

62
00:04:07,933 --> 00:04:10,345
on the principal of <i>n</i>.

63
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:15,115
Now suppose that the company
wants to add the right

64
00:04:16,169 --> 00:04:22,569
to prepay or call the bond at par
after 5 years

65
00:04:24,423 --> 00:04:27,373
but the company cannot change
the original bond.

66
00:04:27,738 --> 00:04:32,963
Let's look at the situation the 
company faces after 5 years

67
00:04:33,163 --> 00:04:35,925
sitting at this time point.

68
00:04:37,495 --> 00:04:41,095
The company is facing cash
flows,

69
00:04:42,338 --> 00:04:44,626
4% annual coupons

70
00:04:46,025 --> 00:04:48,100
on the notional of <i>N</i>.

71
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:52,099
The company wants to add
the option

72
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:57,116
to get rid of these payments
of these 4% annual coupons

73
00:04:59,278 --> 00:05:05,178
and instead pay the notional 
<i>N</i> at date 5.

74
00:05:07,078 --> 00:05:11,953
Now notice that the value of the
bond at time 5

75
00:05:12,591 --> 00:05:16,266
is given by the expression here.

76
00:05:17,181 --> 00:05:18,518
Formally speaking

77
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:23,448
this is the same as the notional
<i>N</i>

78
00:05:23,993 --> 00:05:27,406
plus the value at time 5

79
00:05:27,606 --> 00:05:29,218
of a receiver swap

80
00:05:31,443 --> 00:05:33,418
of length 5 years.

81
00:05:34,238 --> 00:05:37,925
Now the company will only
call the bond at par

82
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:40,988
that means at value <i>N</i>

83
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:45,123
if the value of the receiver swap
is positive.

84
00:05:46,942 --> 00:05:48,317
Now here is the solution.

85
00:05:48,753 --> 00:05:54,103
The company can buy a 5 year into
5 year receiver swaption

86
00:05:54,303 --> 00:05:56,941
with a strike rate of 4%.

87
00:05:57,949 --> 00:06:02,274
The pay off of this swaption at
expiry date 5

88
00:06:02,601 --> 00:06:07,038
is just the positive part of the
value of the receiver swap

89
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:09,451
that was seen

90
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:12,495
on the previous slide.

91
00:06:13,786 --> 00:06:16,361
From a cash flow point of view
this is also clear.

92
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,483
Suppose the company exercises
the swaption,

93
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:23,170
enters the receiver swap,

94
00:06:24,056 --> 00:06:29,419
then the company will receive 
the 4% coupons

95
00:06:29,679 --> 00:06:31,454
on these 5 years.

96
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:36,539
And it will pay floating instead.

97
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:42,512
At the fixed leg payments cancels
with the 4%

98
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:44,887
coupon payments on the bond

99
00:06:45,603 --> 00:06:49,078
and we know from the 
previous part that

100
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:53,979
paying the notional <i>N</i>
at time 5

101
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:59,127
is equivalent to paying the notional
<i>N</i> at time 10

102
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:02,327
and floating in between.

103
00:07:02,993 --> 00:07:07,980
Here is Black's formula for payer
and receiver swaptions

104
00:07:11,657 --> 00:07:16,820
where Φ denotes the standard
normal cumulative distribution function

105
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,107
and the parameters <i>d-1</i> 
and <i>d-2</i> are given here.

106
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:27,908
Again this formula has one
volatility parameter.

107
00:07:28,404 --> 00:07:33,142
It's σ and is called Black volatility
or relative volatility.

108
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:37,995
The underlying modeling assumptions
for Black's formula

109
00:07:38,195 --> 00:07:42,120
which was log normality under the 
forward measure for caplets and floorlets

110
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:45,794
is now different.

111
00:07:45,994 --> 00:07:49,394
Here, it is log normality of the 
swap rate

112
00:07:49,594 --> 00:07:53,344
but under a different measure
then the forward measure.

113
00:07:53,544 --> 00:07:56,694
So we refrain from deriving it
here.

114
00:07:57,447 --> 00:08:02,109
Bachelier's formula for payer and
swaption prices

115
00:08:04,712 --> 00:08:06,724
is shown here

116
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:11,511
where Φ is the standard normal 
cumulative distribution function, 

117
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:15,061
φ is the normal density

118
00:08:15,261 --> 00:08:19,299
and the parameter <i>D</i>
is given here.

119
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:24,083
Again there is a single volatility
parameter σ

120
00:08:24,283 --> 00:08:27,070
called the normal volatility.

121
00:08:28,128 --> 00:08:34,840
Swaption prices are quoted in terms
the Black or normal implied volatilities.

122
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:39,406
The accrued period δ for the 
underlying swap can differ from

123
00:08:39,606 --> 00:08:44,031
prevailing 'δ's for caps
within the same region.

124
00:08:44,957 --> 00:08:47,607
For example, in the Eurozone

125
00:08:47,807 --> 00:08:51,457
caps are typically written on semi
annual LIBOR

126
00:08:51,657 --> 00:08:54,957
where δ is equal to 6 months

127
00:08:55,413 --> 00:08:59,976
while swaps pay annual coupons such
that the δ is 1.

128
00:09:01,203 --> 00:09:03,640
Here is an example 
of swaption quotes

129
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,128
in terms of Black's implied
volatilities

130
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:14,430
of at the money swaptions
in the Eurozone in August 2013.

131
00:09:15,741 --> 00:09:19,328
Maturities range from 
1 to 10 years,

132
00:09:20,174 --> 00:09:23,674
and the swap length from
1 to 10 years.

133
00:09:25,276 --> 00:09:29,539
So the first row gives us the 1 year
into 1 year

134
00:09:29,739 --> 00:09:35,576
2 years, 3 years, and so on to
10 years swaption quotes 

135
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:40,624
in percentage points in terms
Black's implied volatilities.

136
00:09:42,327 --> 00:09:45,502
The matrix of values is illustrated

137
00:09:46,042 --> 00:09:48,992
in the figure on 
the right hand side.

138
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:56,951
An interest rate model for swaptions
valuation must fit

139
00:09:57,295 --> 00:10:00,308
such a given volatility surface.

140
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,495
Here are the normal implied
volatilities

141
00:10:05,506 --> 00:10:08,331
of the same at the money
swaptions

142
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:11,706
in the Euro-zone in August 2013.
