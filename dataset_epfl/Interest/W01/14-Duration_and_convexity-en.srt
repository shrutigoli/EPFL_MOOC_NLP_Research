1
00:00:05,326 --> 00:00:09,402
When it comes to the risk management
of bond portfolio

2
00:00:09,589 --> 00:00:14,877
duration and convexity 
are the basic measures. 

3
00:00:15,089 --> 00:00:18,514
Duration and convexity are the first
and second order 

4
00:00:18,701 --> 00:00:22,514
sensitivity measures of bond prices
with respect

5
00:00:22,701 --> 00:00:25,676
 to parallel shifts 
of the yield curve. 

6
00:00:34,726 --> 00:00:37,377
So let's consider 
a fixed coupon bond

7
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:41,752
with cash flow dates T1, 
T2 up to Tn.

8
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:46,677
So with maturity Tn, 
and let's assume that the cash flows

9
00:00:46,864 --> 00:00:52,851
at Ti are also containing 

10
00:00:53,688 --> 00:01:00,563
the principle at maturity
just for the sake of notation. 

11
00:01:01,556 --> 00:01:05,981
To further simplify the notation,
we assume that small t

12
00:01:06,167 --> 00:01:09,379
now is zero, 
so that we don't have

13
00:01:09,587 --> 00:01:14,137
to write Ti minus small t 
all the time,

14
00:01:14,333 --> 00:01:20,933
and we also abbreviate 
the Ti yield just by the letter yi.

15
00:01:21,803 --> 00:01:24,953
So then we have seen
and we have learned that the price, 

16
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:30,352
at time zero of this bond
is given by the sum

17
00:01:30,527 --> 00:01:34,240
of the discounted cash flow Ci.

18
00:01:35,651 --> 00:01:38,388
The question we're going 
to study now,

19
00:01:38,592 --> 00:01:42,079
how does this price change?

20
00:01:44,815 --> 00:01:47,640
The duration of the bond is defined

21
00:01:47,830 --> 00:01:50,818
as the relative 
first-order sensitivity

22
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:55,004
with respect a parallel shift 
of the yield curve. 

23
00:01:55,661 --> 00:01:59,898
Formally speaking, let s denote 
the parallel shift 

24
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:06,859
then, we differentiate the price
of the bond as a function of s

25
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:10,683
with respect to S 
at S equal to zero

26
00:02:10,891 --> 00:02:16,741
We divide it by the current prize 
and we take a minus sign in font

27
00:02:14,678 --> 00:02:17,678


28
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,585
by convention in order 
to get a positive expression.

29
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:26,202
From that expression, 
we can also see that the duration

30
00:02:26,427 --> 00:02:29,090
is a weighted average 
of the coupon payment dates 

31
00:02:29,292 --> 00:02:30,979
Ti up to Tn.

32
00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:35,704
In other words, 
the duration of zero coupon bond

33
00:02:34,842 --> 00:02:37,842


34
00:02:35,889 --> 00:02:39,739
with maturity T, 
is simply given by T. 

35
00:02:40,854 --> 00:02:44,291
We thus obtain 
the first-order approximation

36
00:02:44,491 --> 00:02:49,203
for relative bond prize changes 
with respect to a parallel shift 

37
00:02:49,382 --> 00:02:52,157
delta y of the yield curve. 

38
00:02:54,163 --> 00:03:00,813
As an example, assume that
the yield curve is flat 3%

39
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:05,417
and consider a bond 
with maturity in 10 years 

40
00:03:05,624 --> 00:03:12,049
and annual coupon payments of 6%
on the principle of 100. 

41
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:19,645
It's price is 125.14

42
00:03:20,594 --> 00:03:25,807
to duration plugging in the formula,
you can compute 

43
00:03:26,024 --> 00:03:29,862
is given by 8.06.

44
00:03:30,758 --> 00:03:36,745
As a second example, we're again 
assume the U-curve is flat 3%

45
00:03:37,465 --> 00:03:41,715
and we consider 
a five year maturing bond 

46
00:03:41,915 --> 00:03:46,578
with annual coupons of 3% 
on the principle of 100. 

47
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:52,674
Again, it is an easy exercise 
to compute the price

48
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:55,786
and the duration. 

49
00:03:56,428 --> 00:04:01,953
Now let's apply the duration 
to immunize the value

50
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,860
of the bond portfolio with respect 
to small parallel shifts 

51
00:04:06,051 --> 00:04:07,501
of the yield curve. 

52
00:04:08,424 --> 00:04:12,862
So let us by pie of s, 
the value of a portfolio 

53
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:17,535
to be hedged as a function 
of the yield shift s.

54
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:22,322
Let H(s) denote the value 
of the hedging instrument 

55
00:04:22,509 --> 00:04:26,097
as function of s. 
Now immunization,

56
00:04:26,297 --> 00:04:30,585
with respect to small parallel shift
of the yield curve then means 

57
00:04:30,764 --> 00:04:34,027
we want to find q, the number
of hedging instrument

58
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:40,193
we want to hold, such that 
the hedge portfolio 

59
00:04:40,407 --> 00:04:45,795
is first-order immune 
against parallel shifts

60
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:47,746
of the yield curve. 

61
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:53,539
Now the solution is given by 
this expression 

62
00:04:53,728 --> 00:04:57,340
which again is given in terms
with the duration 

63
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,363
of the portfolio to be hedged
and the duration

64
00:05:00,555 --> 00:05:02,543
of the hedging instrument. 

65
00:05:03,832 --> 00:05:08,557
Let's look at an example and let's 
revisit the examples 1 and 2

66
00:05:08,730 --> 00:05:11,793
from the bond duration. 

67
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:18,455
Let's immunize a long position
in one 10 year bond

68
00:05:18,637 --> 00:05:23,599
with 6% coupons
by holding q units

69
00:05:23,771 --> 00:05:26,933
of the 5 year bong with 3% coupon.

70
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:30,451
Given what we have seen 
on the previous slide,

71
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,102
the solution is given by - 2.14.

72
00:05:35,911 --> 00:05:41,586
This means that one should short 
2.14 units of the 5 year bonds 

73
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:46,230
in order to hedge one long unit 
of the 10 year bond. 

74
00:05:47,396 --> 00:05:52,058
This figure shows us the performance
of this hedge. 

75
00:05:52,257 --> 00:05:57,470
The red line is the value change
of the immunized portfolio

76
00:05:57,684 --> 00:06:00,272
as a function of the yield shift s. 

77
00:06:01,134 --> 00:06:04,709
In other words, 
when there is no yield shift

78
00:06:04,917 --> 00:06:09,592
the value change is zero, 
and as we can see from this figure,

79
00:06:09,758 --> 00:06:15,258
no matter whether the yield  curve
shifts up or down

80
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:17,795
the value change is positive.

81
00:06:18,017 --> 00:06:22,305
In this case, that's a good hedge.

82
00:06:23,309 --> 00:06:26,796
The convexity of the bond 
is defined  as a relative 

83
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:29,351
second-order sensitivity 
with respect 

84
00:06:29,512 --> 00:06:32,012
to a parallel shift 
of the yield curve. 

85
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:35,156
Formally speaking,
here is the bond price

86
00:06:35,342 --> 00:06:38,867
as function of 
the yield curve shift s. 

87
00:06:39,054 --> 00:06:42,379
We take the second-order derivative
at s equal zero

88
00:06:42,582 --> 00:06:45,670
and we divide 
by the current price p.

89
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,525
This is what we get. 

90
00:06:48,693 --> 00:06:52,593
With the convexity and the duration,
we obtain a second-order 

91
00:06:52,802 --> 00:06:56,602
approximation for relative 
bond price changes

92
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:01,068
with respect to a parallel shift
of the yield curve.

93
00:07:04,594 --> 00:07:09,094
Now combining duration and convexity
we can immunize 

94
00:07:09,302 --> 00:07:12,139
the value of a bond portfolio 
with respect to small 

95
00:07:12,306 --> 00:07:15,618
and not so small parallel shifts 
of the yield curve. 

96
00:07:15,796 --> 00:07:21,533
Let's again consider a portfolio
with value pie s

97
00:07:21,713 --> 00:07:24,876
as function of the yield shift s. 

98
00:07:25,084 --> 00:07:27,297
Now let's consider 
two hedging instruments.

99
00:07:27,527 --> 00:07:34,090
The fist one having value H1 of s
and the second one, H2 of s. 

100
00:07:34,848 --> 00:07:40,973
We want to find q1 and q2
such that the portfolio 

101
00:07:41,163 --> 00:07:45,063
consisting of the original portfolio

102
00:07:45,248 --> 00:07:48,411
plus q1 units 
of the first hedging instruments

103
00:07:48,621 --> 00:07:52,484
plus q2 units 
of the second hedging instrument

104
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,433
is having a zero
first-order sensitivity

105
00:07:56,603 --> 00:07:58,191
with respect to parallel shifts

106
00:07:58,378 --> 00:08:02,403
and a zero second-order sensitivity
with respect to parallel shifts. 

107
00:08:03,489 --> 00:08:08,351
The above system 
can be equivalently expressed 

108
00:08:08,569 --> 00:08:13,294
as a linear system in terms
of the duration and the convexity 

109
00:08:13,486 --> 00:08:16,861
of the original portfolio 
and the hedging instruments, 

110
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:20,710
along with their initial prices. 

111
00:08:20,906 --> 00:08:24,481
This is  a simple linear 
2 by 2 system to solution 

112
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:27,651
as given by inverting 
the 2 by 2 matrix

113
00:08:28,618 --> 00:08:31,906
as shown on that line. 

114
00:08:33,932 --> 00:08:40,869
D pie denotes the duration of pie,
C pie denotes convexity of pie,

115
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:46,656
and similarly DHi and CHi
denote the duration and convexity

116
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:49,916
of the hedging instrument Hi. 

117
00:08:50,984 --> 00:08:55,296
As a numerical example,
we consider a portfolio

118
00:08:55,502 --> 00:09:02,027
with price 32, 863.5,

119
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:07,871
duration 6.76 and convexity 85.329. 

120
00:09:08,516 --> 00:09:13,504
Along with this portfolio 
we consider 2 hedging instruments 

121
00:09:13,725 --> 00:09:17,000
with price duration 
and complexity data given here.

122
00:09:18,577 --> 00:09:22,264
This data is enough 
to find the positions

123
00:09:22,463 --> 00:09:26,426
in the hedging instruments q1 and q2

124
00:09:26,618 --> 00:09:33,405
such that the hedged portfolio 
is immunized 

125
00:09:34,288 --> 00:09:38,363
to parallel shifts 
of the yield curve. 

126
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:44,538
The solution is you should buy 
140.3 units

127
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:51,357
of the second hedging instruments
and sell short 304.8 units 

128
00:09:51,518 --> 00:09:55,293
of the 1st hedging instruments.
