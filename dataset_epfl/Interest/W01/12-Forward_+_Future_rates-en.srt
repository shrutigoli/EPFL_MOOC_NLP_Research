1
00:00:05,826 --> 00:00:06,964
In this part

2
00:00:07,486 --> 00:00:10,936
we will now introduce forward
rate agreements

3
00:00:11,523 --> 00:00:12,935
and interest rate futures.

4
00:00:13,997 --> 00:00:17,197
Both contracts allow you to lock in

5
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:22,638
rates today, for loans
on future time intervals.

6
00:00:24,776 --> 00:00:28,926
The rate that you lock in today
is what is called forward rate.

7
00:00:30,904 --> 00:00:32,429
In case of 
the forward rate agreement

8
00:00:32,629 --> 00:00:34,466
and in case of 
the interest rate futures

9
00:00:34,733 --> 00:00:36,821
it is called the futures rate.

10
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:42,317
We will relate futures rates
and forward rates.

11
00:00:43,926 --> 00:00:46,951
Forward rate agreement FRA

12
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:51,313
at calendar date t is specified

13
00:00:52,188 --> 00:00:55,576
by a future period (T-0, T-1),

14
00:00:56,345 --> 00:00:58,957
with lengths that we denote by δ,

15
00:01:00,437 --> 00:01:03,662
a fixed rate K, 
and a notional N.

16
00:01:04,966 --> 00:01:06,291
At T-1

17
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:09,478
the holder of the forward rate
agreement

18
00:01:10,004 --> 00:01:13,066
pays a fixed rate K

19
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:14,466
on the notional,

20
00:01:16,332 --> 00:01:18,169
and in turn receives

21
00:01:19,532 --> 00:01:22,182
the floating rate on the notional.

22
00:01:22,568 --> 00:01:25,705
This is called floating because

23
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,772
this rate

24
00:01:28,358 --> 00:01:31,895
is only known at the future
time point T-0.

25
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:38,750
This forward rate agreement allows
you to lock in a fixed rate

26
00:01:39,497 --> 00:01:40,484
today

27
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:44,530
over the future period (T-0, T-1).

28
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:48,050
Suppose you know you are
going to take a loan

29
00:01:48,492 --> 00:01:51,480
with notional N
at time T-0)

30
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:56,371
According to the then prevailing
market conditions

31
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:58,408
you would have to pay back
the loan

32
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:04,408
along with the simple rate
L(T-0, T-1).

33
00:02:04,921 --> 00:02:06,358
Suppose you dislike

34
00:02:06,714 --> 00:02:10,964
the uncertainty of this interest
cash flow today

35
00:02:11,517 --> 00:02:14,892
and instead you want to lock in
a rate K

36
00:02:15,256 --> 00:02:18,494
that is fixed today which 
you are going to pay on this loan.

37
00:02:18,925 --> 00:02:22,188
Holding this forward rate agreement
does exactly that.

38
00:02:22,746 --> 00:02:25,271
Remember that you will have to pay

39
00:02:25,958 --> 00:02:28,471
the fixed rate K

40
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,875
and you will receive the floating.

41
00:02:33,231 --> 00:02:36,518
As you now can see,
the floating payments

42
00:02:37,469 --> 00:02:39,507
simply cancel off.

43
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:45,147
And what you are in fact paying
is the fixed rate K.

44
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,693
Of course the question arises,

45
00:02:48,893 --> 00:02:53,530
as to what is a fair fixed rate K
that you will fix today

46
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:56,730
given the market information

47
00:02:57,881 --> 00:02:58,818
that is

48
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:04,443
all the zero coupon
bond prices at t.

49
00:03:05,531 --> 00:03:07,068
To answer this question

50
00:03:07,525 --> 00:03:10,900
we now compute the value
of this forward rate agreement

51
00:03:11,485 --> 00:03:13,022
and set it equal to 0.

52
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,684
We start by the pay off of the 
forward rate agreement at T-1.

53
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:22,570
Remember it is given by the difference
of the floating rate payments

54
00:03:22,807 --> 00:03:26,057
minus the fixed rate payment
on the notional N.

55
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:29,931
We now re-express this simple rate

56
00:03:30,476 --> 00:03:31,913
in terms of

57
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,640
the T-1 bond price at T-0.

58
00:03:35,981 --> 00:03:37,431
We will then call this

59
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:42,298
I-1

60
00:03:44,173 --> 00:03:45,510
minus I-2

61
00:03:46,849 --> 00:03:51,299
and we will value these components 
I-1 and I-2 

62
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,873
separately using discount bonds.

63
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:04,909
I-1

64
00:04:06,438 --> 00:04:09,013
is a cash flow

65
00:04:10,667 --> 00:04:13,854
that we do not know today at time t

66
00:04:14,344 --> 00:04:16,381
but we know it at time T-0.

67
00:04:17,602 --> 00:04:21,139
Hence the value of this cash flow
I-1 at time T-1

68
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:27,864
at time T-0 is given by simply
multiplying it with the T-1 bond price.

69
00:04:30,153 --> 00:04:33,478
But since I-1 is the reciprocal
of the T-1 bond price

70
00:04:33,971 --> 00:04:39,071
we get as value at time T-0, 1.

71
00:04:39,287 --> 00:04:41,625
So that the time t value

72
00:04:43,568 --> 00:04:46,281
is the T-0 bond price.

73
00:04:47,645 --> 00:04:50,220
At the time t value of I-2, 

74
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,928
we get even simpler because this is
a cash flow that we know at time t.

75
00:04:57,436 --> 00:05:01,611
Hence it's time t value
is simply given by

76
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:05,086
multiplying it with the T-1 bond.

77
00:05:06,942 --> 00:05:08,217
This is what we get.

78
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:13,898
So the total time t value of the 
forward rate agreement therefore is

79
00:05:14,313 --> 00:05:17,338
given by the difference of these
2 expressions

80
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:21,381
that we have here on the right
hand side, and be called

81
00:05:22,145 --> 00:05:25,145
the value V-FRA.

82
00:05:26,268 --> 00:05:27,281
So we see

83
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,150
that the value 
of the forward rate agreement

84
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,380
depends on the choice
of the fixed rate K.

85
00:05:34,444 --> 00:05:37,869
The larger K is, 
the smaller the value.

86
00:05:38,069 --> 00:05:39,831
It can even be negative

87
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:44,013
from the point of view of the holder 
of the forward rate agreement.

88
00:05:44,850 --> 00:05:48,187
But of course there is a counter 
party to the forward rate agreement.

89
00:05:49,032 --> 00:05:52,944
And for the counter party, the value
will just have the opposite sign.

90
00:05:53,248 --> 00:05:57,410
So it's a reasonable choice
to choose K the fixed rate

91
00:05:57,790 --> 00:06:00,140
such that the value is 0.

92
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:05,098
Simple algebra shows that the rate K

93
00:06:05,417 --> 00:06:08,817
which renders this value equal to 0

94
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:12,987
is given by this expression here.

95
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,768
We call it the simple forward rate

96
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,330
prevailing at time t.

97
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:27,976
When the time t coincides with the
initial date T-0 of the loan period

98
00:06:28,363 --> 00:06:32,013
we get back the simple rate L.

99
00:06:33,231 --> 00:06:37,294
Which we now sometimes also call
simple spot rate

100
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:41,443
just to highlight the difference
to the forward rate.

101
00:06:42,478 --> 00:06:47,290
It's further an easy exercise to see
that we can re-express

102
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:52,658
The time t value of the forward rate 
agreement in terms of the forward rate

103
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:54,252
as follows.

104
00:06:55,143 --> 00:06:57,831
Now this expression nicely
shows again

105
00:06:58,031 --> 00:07:01,656
that there is a fair choice
of the fixed rate K

106
00:07:02,286 --> 00:07:04,649
namely the forward rate

107
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:08,949
which renders this value of
the forward rate agreement 0.

108
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:12,756
If K is chosen too large

109
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:15,579
the value will become negative.

110
00:07:16,642 --> 00:07:18,967
If K is chosen too small

111
00:07:19,628 --> 00:07:22,091
the value becomes positive.

112
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:26,018
Now think of the following situation

113
00:07:26,602 --> 00:07:31,227
that K is yesterday's forward rate.

114
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:34,702
Now yesterday's forward rate 
in general

115
00:07:34,902 --> 00:07:37,902
will be different from 
today's forward rate.

116
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:42,045
That means if you entered a forward
rate agreement yesterday,

117
00:07:42,771 --> 00:07:45,446
yesterday's prevailing forward rate

118
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:48,949
seen from today's point of view

119
00:07:49,571 --> 00:07:53,009
the value may have become non zero.

120
00:07:53,209 --> 00:07:56,009
It may have become positive
incase

121
00:07:56,499 --> 00:07:58,649
the interest rate went up.

122
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:02,291
But it may also have become
negative

123
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:05,400
in case the interest rate
had gone down.

124
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:09,871
If we let the length of the
lending period

125
00:08:10,478 --> 00:08:11,966
converge at 0,

126
00:08:12,631 --> 00:08:15,969
that is, if we let T-1 converge 
at T-0

127
00:08:16,654 --> 00:08:21,292
in the limit, we obtain what we call
the instantaneous forward rate

128
00:08:21,678 --> 00:08:24,240
with maturity T-0.

129
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,028
Elementary calculus shows you

130
00:08:28,305 --> 00:08:32,130
that this limit is given by 
minus the logarithmic 

131
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:36,766
derivative of the T bond price
with respect to maturity.

132
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:40,651
Because the terminal value
of the T bod is 1, 

133
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,594
this relation is equivalent
to this formula.

134
00:08:47,362 --> 00:08:51,912
The nice thing about instantaneous 
forward rates is that

135
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:56,041
knowing all the instantaneous
forward rates is equivalent

136
00:08:56,501 --> 00:08:59,014
to knowing all the
T-bond prices.

137
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:03,215
As before, for varying maturities

138
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:08,235
we obtain a term structure of rates.

139
00:09:08,634 --> 00:09:12,009
In this case, it's the term structure
of forward rates prevailing

140
00:09:12,209 --> 00:09:14,271
at calendar date t.

141
00:09:14,952 --> 00:09:17,902
This is also called the
forward curve.

142
00:09:18,470 --> 00:09:22,083
It's easy to see that forward
rates are related to yields.

143
00:09:24,237 --> 00:09:25,149
In this way

144
00:09:25,658 --> 00:09:26,970
that means that

145
00:09:27,468 --> 00:09:30,906
the yield is the time average

146
00:09:31,574 --> 00:09:33,912
of forward rates.

147
00:09:34,557 --> 00:09:36,694
It also follows from this relation

148
00:09:36,894 --> 00:09:39,894
that the short ends of 
the forward curve

149
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,933
and of the yield curve coincide

150
00:09:44,133 --> 00:09:47,508
and are equal to the short rate.

151
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:54,297
Similar to a forward rate agreement,
an interest rate futures contract

152
00:09:54,615 --> 00:09:57,015
allows the management 
of exposure

153
00:09:57,707 --> 00:10:00,007
to the futures spot interest rate

154
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:05,098
prevailing over a future period
(T-0, T-1).

155
00:10:06,198 --> 00:10:08,998
In contrast to forward rate
agreements however

156
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:13,044
interest rate futures are daily
marked to market

157
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:14,444
or resettled.

158
00:10:15,085 --> 00:10:17,023
To understand what this means

159
00:10:17,419 --> 00:10:21,931
recall that the value of a forward
rate agreement

160
00:10:22,131 --> 00:10:23,869
may change in time.

161
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:29,150
At time t when you enter the forward
rate agreement,

162
00:10:29,839 --> 00:10:34,139
you will do it typically at conditions 
which render its value equal to 0.

163
00:10:36,306 --> 00:10:41,231
But already the next day, 
economic conditions may have changed.

164
00:10:41,963 --> 00:10:44,726
And the value of the forward rate
agreement

165
00:10:45,618 --> 00:10:49,756
turns out to your favor
to become positive.

166
00:10:50,553 --> 00:10:54,466
This value may of course
also become negative.

167
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,968
Eventually, it will converge

168
00:10:58,577 --> 00:11:02,102
to the pay off of the
forward rate agreement.

169
00:11:03,177 --> 00:11:06,014
Now instead of sitting, and waiting,

170
00:11:06,692 --> 00:11:10,854
and seeing the exposure
to your counter party

171
00:11:11,054 --> 00:11:14,029
getting a positive value
or negative value;

172
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:17,679
market participants prefer

173
00:11:18,882 --> 00:11:23,182
to settle any change in value
immediately.

174
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:26,047
This is done by
marking to market.

175
00:11:26,247 --> 00:11:30,372
In this example it would mean
on the day after today

176
00:11:32,295 --> 00:11:33,595
you would settle

177
00:11:35,723 --> 00:11:38,098
this increase of value

178
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:41,082
by receiving a cash flow from
your counter party.

179
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:46,627
Making the exposure to your counter
party again 0.

180
00:11:47,455 --> 00:11:49,317
While the next day

181
00:11:50,318 --> 00:11:53,805
you may have to return
a part of that

182
00:11:54,297 --> 00:11:56,722
to your counter party and so on
and so forth.

183
00:11:58,535 --> 00:12:02,647
Formally, the marking to market of
interest rate futures contracts

184
00:12:02,847 --> 00:12:04,760
works as follows.

185
00:12:05,637 --> 00:12:07,737
At any calendar date t

186
00:12:09,206 --> 00:12:12,381
a so called futures price
is quoted.

187
00:12:12,944 --> 00:12:15,894
This futures price is related

188
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:19,094
to the futures rate in this way.

189
00:12:19,422 --> 00:12:23,284
This expression looks different than
the value of a forward rate agreement

190
00:12:24,502 --> 00:12:28,040
but in fact, it reacts the same way
to change

191
00:12:29,088 --> 00:12:30,963
in interest rate environment.

192
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:34,579
The day after today

193
00:12:36,358 --> 00:12:39,333
one determines the futures price

194
00:12:40,678 --> 00:12:43,866
And the difference of the futures
price

195
00:12:45,513 --> 00:12:47,200
on ( t + Δt)

196
00:12:48,145 --> 00:12:50,458
minus the futures price from 
yesterday

197
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:54,045
is the cash flow to the holder
of the futures contract.

198
00:12:55,073 --> 00:12:58,261
Recall this cash flow can be
positive or negative.

199
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,336
Futures rate here is chosen

200
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:06,224
such that the following 
2 conditions hold.

201
00:13:08,131 --> 00:13:10,406
At the settlement date,
or delivery date

202
00:13:10,606 --> 00:13:12,718
of the futures contract T-0.

203
00:13:14,482 --> 00:13:19,307
The futures rate equals the
underlined spot rate.

204
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:22,995
At any earlier date

205
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:26,946
the present value of the cash flow

206
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:31,467
in the future, from holding
the futures contract

207
00:13:32,003 --> 00:13:33,578
has to be equal to 0.

208
00:13:34,151 --> 00:13:37,026
These rules fix the futures rate.

209
00:13:38,004 --> 00:13:41,741
But there is no direct functional
relationship

210
00:13:41,941 --> 00:13:44,716
between futures rates and
zero coupon bonds

211
00:13:45,054 --> 00:13:48,054
as is the case for forward rates.

212
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:51,026
As a consequence, futures rates

213
00:13:51,798 --> 00:13:54,023
are generally different from
forward rates.

214
00:13:55,941 --> 00:14:00,229
The difference between futures rates
and minus forward rates

215
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,941
is called convexity adjustment.

216
00:14:04,425 --> 00:14:06,700
This difference is typically 
positive.

217
00:14:09,059 --> 00:14:12,997
As a market example, I mentioned
here the Eurodollar futures contract

218
00:14:13,273 --> 00:14:15,360
which is tied to the LIBOR.

219
00:14:16,374 --> 00:14:21,974
It was introduced by the Chicago
Mercantile Exchange in 1981

220
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:25,039
and has been traded since then

221
00:14:26,309 --> 00:14:27,797
on that exchange.

222
00:14:28,729 --> 00:14:31,966
It is designed to protect the owner
from fluctuations

223
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:35,054
in future 3-month LIBOR rates.

224
00:14:37,106 --> 00:14:39,831
These futures contracts are highly
standardized.

225
00:14:40,031 --> 00:14:42,044
Their settlement or delivery months

226
00:14:42,244 --> 00:14:46,056
are in March, June, September
and December.

227
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:49,619
This is in contrast to
forward rate agreements

228
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:51,881
which are traded over the counter.
