1
00:00:05,481 --> 00:00:06,956
In this first part

2
00:00:07,788 --> 00:00:11,950
I will introduce the various notions
of interest rates and related contracts.

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,763
Starting from the basic definition
of interest paid on a loan

4
00:00:18,022 --> 00:00:22,359
we derive simple and continuously 
compounded rates,

5
00:00:22,559 --> 00:00:25,634
also called LIBOR, and yield.

6
00:00:26,807 --> 00:00:29,807
They depend on the length of the
lending period

7
00:00:30,007 --> 00:00:33,007
and at the short hand coincide

8
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:36,048
and are equal to the so called
short rate.

9
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:41,304
Investing and continuously
reinvesting at the short rate

10
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:44,780
gives us the money market account

11
00:00:44,967 --> 00:00:47,380
and we will see that
this is a risk free asset. 

12
00:00:48,661 --> 00:00:50,874
In turn, the zero coupon bond

13
00:00:51,524 --> 00:00:55,361
is the securitized form of a loan.

14
00:00:56,747 --> 00:01:02,234
And they can be used to discount
future cash flows

15
00:01:03,192 --> 00:01:05,641
which is why they are also
called discount bonds.

16
00:01:07,098 --> 00:01:11,323
Interest refers to the rent paid
by a borrower of money

17
00:01:11,523 --> 00:01:14,648
to a lender of money
over a period of time.

18
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:17,440
Here we have a period of time.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,978
It starts at calendar date t,

20
00:01:21,178 --> 00:01:24,178
and it ends at the maturity date T.

21
00:01:26,072 --> 00:01:30,209
The lender will pay a loan of 1

22
00:01:32,237 --> 00:01:35,712
unit of currency to the borrower.

23
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:42,925
And the borrower in turn will pay
back this principal amount

24
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,487
plus interest at the maturity T.

25
00:01:49,841 --> 00:01:54,078
Interest is expressed in annualized
interest rates.

26
00:01:54,528 --> 00:01:58,428
With simple compounding, we arrive
at a simple rate

27
00:01:58,788 --> 00:02:00,238
that we call L.

28
00:02:01,529 --> 00:02:04,829
Which is defined 
by this equation here

29
00:02:05,468 --> 00:02:09,493
which simply states that L is
the interest R

30
00:02:10,018 --> 00:02:13,093
divided by the length of the lending
period.

31
00:02:13,795 --> 00:02:16,308
There's also a continuously 
compounded version

32
00:02:17,431 --> 00:02:20,031
which is also called the yield

33
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,408
and we label it by the letter y.

34
00:02:24,634 --> 00:02:28,359
And is defined 
by this equation here.

35
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:33,355
Here is a market example,
the LIBOR.

36
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:37,065
LIBOR stands for London InterBank
Offered Rate.

37
00:02:37,964 --> 00:02:42,152
This is the rate at which high credit
financial institutions can borrow

38
00:02:42,352 --> 00:02:44,914
on the London InterBank 
money market.

39
00:02:45,802 --> 00:02:47,352
This rate however

40
00:02:47,746 --> 00:02:51,933
has become an important reference
rate for many interest rate contracts

41
00:02:52,133 --> 00:02:55,246
beyond the London InterBank money
market.

42
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:58,879
It is quoted daily as a simple rate

43
00:02:59,457 --> 00:03:02,657
and this is why 
I choose the letter L

44
00:03:03,222 --> 00:03:05,097
to denote the simple rate.

45
00:03:05,872 --> 00:03:09,372
And it is quoted for various 
maturities

46
00:03:09,572 --> 00:03:12,147
ranging from 1 day to 1 year,

47
00:03:12,715 --> 00:03:15,828
and it is quoted 
for various currencies.

48
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:20,990
Interest rates depend on the lending
period

49
00:03:22,295 --> 00:03:27,982
this is why we also use the argument
t and T

50
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:34,714
when we notate for simple and 
continuously compounded rates.

51
00:03:36,326 --> 00:03:39,913
If we freeze the current calendar 
date t

52
00:03:40,113 --> 00:03:42,676
and we vary the maturity T.

53
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:47,809
We obtain what is called the term
structure of interest rates

54
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:50,309
prevailing at t.

55
00:03:52,312 --> 00:03:54,774
We see the curve here in black

56
00:03:55,137 --> 00:03:57,974
the simple interest rate.

57
00:03:59,006 --> 00:04:03,244
And in red, we see the term 
structure of yields

58
00:04:04,718 --> 00:04:07,043
which we also call the yield curve.

59
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:10,152
It is a mathematical fact that

60
00:04:11,268 --> 00:04:13,931
for the same interest,

61
00:04:14,531 --> 00:04:19,806
the simple rate is larger 
than the yield.

62
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:23,394
While at the short end

63
00:04:24,538 --> 00:04:27,125
both curves coincide

64
00:04:27,594 --> 00:04:31,919
and we will see later this is what
we call the short rate.

65
00:04:34,429 --> 00:04:37,316
If we vary the calendar
date t

66
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:40,979
we obtain a time series
of terms structures

67
00:04:42,766 --> 00:04:46,954
that is plotted in this graph
overhear.

68
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:50,432
So what we saw on the previous
slide

69
00:04:50,632 --> 00:04:53,632
was a snapshot for a given
calendar date t,

70
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,107
we saw the term structure
of interest rates.

71
00:04:58,931 --> 00:05:01,131
It is clear as calendar time

72
00:05:02,595 --> 00:05:05,808
proceeds, economic conditions
change

73
00:05:06,048 --> 00:05:09,598
and this term structure
will fluctuate.

74
00:05:10,766 --> 00:05:14,816
As you can see from this plot,
which is taken from empirical data.

75
00:05:15,614 --> 00:05:18,952
These fluctuations of 
the term structures are manifold.

76
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,512
Modeling this time series,

77
00:05:22,043 --> 00:05:25,968
is the aim of this course
on interest rate models.

78
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:30,142
Such models are useful then

79
00:05:30,342 --> 00:05:35,479
for financial risk management and 
pricing interest rate derivatives

80
00:05:35,679 --> 00:05:38,442
in a consistent and arbitrage free
way.

81
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:43,262
Here I come back to what we saw
on the previous slide

82
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:47,971
with term structure of interest rate
and the yield curve.

83
00:05:49,267 --> 00:05:53,392
They both coincide 
at the short end.

84
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:58,934
This common short end is called
the short rate.

85
00:05:59,738 --> 00:06:02,413
The short rate is the rate earned

86
00:06:02,876 --> 00:06:05,564
on a loan over the short period

87
00:06:06,496 --> 00:06:09,108
[ t, t + dt ].

88
00:06:10,042 --> 00:06:13,042
Investing 1 unit of currency

89
00:06:13,633 --> 00:06:17,933
at the short rate, and continuously
reinvesting it

90
00:06:18,928 --> 00:06:20,228
at the short rate

91
00:06:21,096 --> 00:06:23,108
gives the money market account.

92
00:06:23,827 --> 00:06:26,352
The return on the money market
account

93
00:06:27,950 --> 00:06:32,175
over the period B(t + dt)

94
00:06:32,983 --> 00:06:36,858
is given by 1 + r(t) dt.

95
00:06:38,138 --> 00:06:42,726
with the initial normalization, this
equation is equivalent

96
00:06:43,724 --> 00:06:45,461
to this expression here.

97
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:49,486
So what we see on the plot
on the right hand side

98
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:53,307
is, for a given trajectory

99
00:06:53,865 --> 00:06:58,078
of the short rate 
evolving over time.

100
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:02,258
We have it on that scale here.

101
00:07:03,413 --> 00:07:08,338
The red line shows us how the money
market evolves.

102
00:07:10,757 --> 00:07:12,157
At each time

103
00:07:12,988 --> 00:07:17,613
the rate of return on this money 
market account

104
00:07:17,897 --> 00:07:21,910
is given by the respective 
short rate.

105
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:23,435
The money market account

106
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,050
is a risk free asset.

107
00:07:26,782 --> 00:07:29,582
Risk free in the sense that,

108
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,169
it's return

109
00:07:32,043 --> 00:07:35,580
over a time interval

110
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,318
is known at the beginning 
of the time interval.

111
00:07:38,553 --> 00:07:41,678
This is very much in difference

112
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:44,351
to risky assets

113
00:07:44,775 --> 00:07:49,862
where the return is only known 
at the end of the time period.

114
00:07:50,613 --> 00:07:54,676
And where mathematically we would
have to add

115
00:07:55,638 --> 00:07:57,876
a noise term here.

116
00:07:58,708 --> 00:08:02,258
A zero coupon bond with
maturity T

117
00:08:02,797 --> 00:08:06,897
is a contract that pays its
holder 1 unit of currency

118
00:08:08,015 --> 00:08:09,602
at the maturity.

119
00:08:10,005 --> 00:08:12,368
This zero coupon bond with
maturity T

120
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:14,955
for short is also called
a T-bond.

121
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:18,145
Its price at time t

122
00:08:18,685 --> 00:08:21,247
is denoted by

123
00:08:21,621 --> 00:08:24,921
P(T, t).

124
00:08:25,849 --> 00:08:28,424
A zero coupon bond is the
securitized 

125
00:08:28,974 --> 00:08:32,211
that is, tradable form of a loan.

126
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:36,448
It is related to a loan 
in the following sense.

127
00:08:36,827 --> 00:08:38,140
At t,

128
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:42,258
the lender buys a zero coupon bond
from the borrower.

129
00:08:42,642 --> 00:08:47,054
and pays the price P.

130
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:51,370
At the maturity T,

131
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:54,379
the lender receives 1 from
the borrower.

132
00:08:55,719 --> 00:08:58,419
Buying a T-bond at time t

133
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:00,933
and holding it until maturity

134
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:04,133
generates a simple rate
of return

135
00:09:04,618 --> 00:09:07,156
which is given by the simple rate L.

136
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:10,274
Formally speaking,

137
00:09:11,245 --> 00:09:14,245
the zero coupon bond price is
related to the simple rate

138
00:09:14,445 --> 00:09:15,870
by this equation.

139
00:09:16,487 --> 00:09:19,137
Buying a T-bond and
holding it until maturity

140
00:09:19,337 --> 00:09:22,074
generates a logarithmic rate
of return

141
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:24,646
which is given by the yield.

142
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:28,789
Again this is expressed by
this relation down here.

143
00:09:30,643 --> 00:09:33,906
A zero coupon bond. is also
called a discount bond.

144
00:09:35,816 --> 00:09:38,328
P is the price

145
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:41,403
at calendar time t.

146
00:09:41,603 --> 00:09:48,015
over cash flow of 1 at maturity T.

147
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:51,013
Now for varying maturities T

148
00:09:51,752 --> 00:09:54,890
we obtain the term structure
of zero coupon bond prices

149
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,977
prevailing at t.

150
00:09:59,466 --> 00:10:02,041
This is also called
the discount curve.

151
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:07,003
This discount curve is typically
decreasing and smooth.

152
00:10:07,945 --> 00:10:11,845
It reflects a positive time value
of money.

153
00:10:13,303 --> 00:10:14,640
At the short end.

154
00:10:16,444 --> 00:10:19,057
The discount curve equals 1

155
00:10:19,969 --> 00:10:22,669
because the cash flow of 1

156
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:25,351
at calendar date t

157
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:30,097
has value 1 at T.

158
00:10:31,196 --> 00:10:35,184
In reality, interest rates depend
on various factors.

159
00:10:36,424 --> 00:10:39,762
They can depend on the credit 
worthiness of the borrower.

160
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,692
The less credit worthy the borrower,

161
00:10:42,892 --> 00:10:45,667
the more the lender will charge
for a loan.

162
00:10:46,655 --> 00:10:49,580
They also depend on the
liquidity needs of the lender.

163
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,897
The more liquidity the lender needs,

164
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:56,385
the more the lender will charge
for a loan.

165
00:10:57,007 --> 00:10:59,907
Interest rates also depend on
regulatory requirements

166
00:11:00,107 --> 00:11:03,219
and the monetary policy
by the central banks.

167
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:08,111
And interest rates also depend on
the market micro structure.

168
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,951
Various interest rate contracts

169
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:14,151
are traded on various markets.

170
00:11:14,539 --> 00:11:18,027
And these markets are not always
perfectly integrated.

171
00:11:18,738 --> 00:11:21,275
In theory however,
for this course

172
00:11:21,707 --> 00:11:24,857
we will assume that 
there is no credit risk;

173
00:11:25,891 --> 00:11:28,254
which means buying a bond

174
00:11:29,027 --> 00:11:31,052
will give the holder of the bond

175
00:11:31,753 --> 00:11:34,890
the face value at the end
of the maturity.

176
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,465
And we also assume that there exists
a frictionless market.

177
00:11:38,665 --> 00:11:41,978
where all T-bonds for all maturities
are traded.
