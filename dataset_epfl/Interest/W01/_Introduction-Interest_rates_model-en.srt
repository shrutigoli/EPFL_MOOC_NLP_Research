00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:09,178
Welcome to the M.O.O.C on
interest rate models.

2
00:00:09,967 --> 00:00:13,729
I'm Damir Filipovic, and I will
be your professor for this course.

3
00:00:15,897 --> 00:00:18,722
A component that is common
to various financial products

4
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,622
and transactions,
 is the interest rate.

5
00:00:22,945 --> 00:00:25,882
Interest is the rent paid
for a loan of money

6
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:27,320
over a period of time.

7
00:00:28,909 --> 00:00:31,984
Interest exists because an amount
of money has a different value

8
00:00:32,184 --> 00:00:33,221
at different times.

9
00:00:34,715 --> 00:00:36,952
Interest accounts 
for these value changes.

10
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,578
Interest is the time value of money.

11
00:00:42,653 --> 00:00:44,978
Interest rates themselves
change over time

12
00:00:45,178 --> 00:00:46,828
because the economy changes.

13
00:00:47,576 --> 00:00:49,514
Future interest rates 
are as uncertain

14
00:00:49,701 --> 00:00:51,926
as the future state
of the economy is.

15
00:00:52,476 --> 00:00:55,039
Stochastic models for the evolution
of interest rates

16
00:00:55,226 --> 00:00:58,314
are an important ingredient
for financial risk management

17
00:00:58,514 --> 00:01:00,689
and the pricing 
of interest rate products.

18
00:01:02,222 --> 00:01:04,784
The volume of such products indeed
is huge.

19
00:01:05,032 --> 00:01:07,507
The outstanding notional amount
is in the order of

20
00:01:07,682 --> 00:01:10,645
hundreds of trillions 
of U.S dollars currently.

21
00:01:11,413 --> 00:01:15,063
This course gives you an introduction
to stochastic interest rate models.

22
00:01:16,014 --> 00:01:19,251
It consists of the 4 parts
as shown here.

23
00:01:20,268 --> 00:01:23,380
And I will now briefly comment
on each part separately.

24
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,352
In the first part, I introduce
the notion of interest rates

25
00:01:28,552 --> 00:01:30,740
and some related basic contracts.

26
00:01:32,752 --> 00:01:37,164
A bond is the securitized, that is,
tradable form of a loan.

27
00:01:38,082 --> 00:01:41,294
There exist coupon paying bonds
and zero coupon bonds.

28
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:44,636
The latter, are also called
discount bonds.

29
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:47,044
The price of a discount bond
is simply

30
00:01:47,244 --> 00:01:50,869
the present value of a cash flow,
of one unit of currency

31
00:01:51,057 --> 00:01:53,107
at some future maturity date.

32
00:01:54,651 --> 00:01:57,901
Interest rates and bond prices
depend on their maturity.

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,390
The term structure, is the function
that maps the maturity

34
00:02:02,565 --> 00:02:05,440
to the corresponding interest rate,
or bond price.

35
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:10,842
An important reference rate for many
interest rate contracts is The L.I.B.O.R.

36
00:02:11,296 --> 00:02:13,146
The London Inter-Bank Offered Rate. 

37
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:17,113
It is daily fixed for various 
currencies and maturities.

38
00:02:18,874 --> 00:02:21,874
Loans can also be borrowed
over future time intervals

39
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:24,436
at rates that are agreed upon today.

40
00:02:25,098 --> 00:02:28,160
These rates are called Forward
or Futures rates

41
00:02:28,348 --> 00:02:30,598
depending on the type
of the agreement.

42
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:35,479
In an interest rate swap,
counter parties exchange

43
00:02:35,679 --> 00:02:37,316
a stream of fixed rate payments

44
00:02:37,654 --> 00:02:39,879
for a stream of floating rate
payments.

45
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:44,204
Typically indexed to L.I.B.O.R
of a particular maturity.

46
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:48,810
When it comes to managing
the interest rate risk

47
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:52,835
of a bond portfolio, Duration and
Convexity are the basic tools.

48
00:02:54,236 --> 00:02:57,299
We will also review some of the most
common market conventions

49
00:02:57,499 --> 00:03:00,199
that come along with interest rate
market data.

50
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:04,881
In the second part, we will learn
how to estimate

51
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:07,456
the term structure for market data.

52
00:03:07,985 --> 00:03:09,935
There are 2 types of methods.

53
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:15,603
Exact methods produce term structures
that exactly match the market data.

54
00:03:16,734 --> 00:03:20,459
This comes at a cost of somewhat 
irregular shapes of the term structure.

55
00:03:21,423 --> 00:03:24,436
Smooth methods penalize
irregualar shapes

56
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:29,298
and trade off exactness of fit versus 
regularity of the term structure.

57
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:33,788
We will also see what Principal 
Component Analysis tells us

58
00:03:33,988 --> 00:03:36,913
about the basic shapes
of the term structure.

59
00:03:39,067 --> 00:03:42,304
Models for the evolution of the term
structure of interest rates

60
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:44,642
build on stochastic calculus. 

61
00:03:45,633 --> 00:03:49,458
In the third part, I will give a 
crash course in stochastic calculus.

62
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:54,019
I will introduce Brownian motion, 
stochastic integration and processes,

63
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,073
but without going into 
mathematical details.

64
00:03:57,954 --> 00:04:01,279
The good news is that this
will give you the necessary tools

65
00:04:01,479 --> 00:04:06,029
to engineer a large variety 
of stochastic interest rate models.

66
00:04:07,868 --> 00:04:10,655
We will then study some
of the most prevalent

67
00:04:11,096 --> 00:04:15,296
so called, Short rate models,
and Heath-Jarrow-Morton models.

68
00:04:18,445 --> 00:04:22,307
I will also review the arbitrage
pricing theorem from finance.

69
00:04:22,507 --> 00:04:26,870
That provides the foundation for
pricing financial derivatives.

70
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:32,151
Eventually, we will see 
how we can use these models

71
00:04:32,351 --> 00:04:34,139
to price options on bonds.

72
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:39,068
In the fourth part, we will then
apply what we learned 

73
00:04:39,412 --> 00:04:41,424
to price interest rate derivatives.

74
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:45,669
Specifically, we will focus on the
standard derivatives,

75
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:50,094
interest rate futures, caps
and floors, and swaptions. 

76
00:04:50,728 --> 00:04:52,353
We will see and understand 

77
00:04:52,565 --> 00:04:55,040
the industry standard 
Black and Bachelier formulas

78
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:57,940
for cap, floor, and swaption prices.

79
00:04:58,586 --> 00:05:00,599
And eventually in a case study

80
00:05:00,799 --> 00:05:04,061
we will see how to calibrate 
a stochastic interest rate model

81
00:05:04,261 --> 00:05:05,599
to market data.
