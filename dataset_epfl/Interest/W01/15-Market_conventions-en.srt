1
00:00:05,031 --> 00:00:07,418
Whenever you work with market data 

2
00:00:07,618 --> 00:00:11,155
you have to take into account the conventions
that come along with them.

3
00:00:12,009 --> 00:00:15,446
There are quite many of them and
they have to be checked case by case.

4
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:20,058
In this course, I will focus on 
2 particular ones.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,987
First is the day-count convention.

6
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:27,712
How do we measure time
between 2 calendar dates?

7
00:00:28,661 --> 00:00:32,524
And the second one is about
clean and dirty prices,

8
00:00:32,724 --> 00:00:36,249
and accrued interest.
And that addresses the issue that

9
00:00:36,449 --> 00:00:41,536
at the coupon payments, you have
systematic price jumps of coupon bonds.

10
00:00:43,081 --> 00:00:46,743
By convention, we measure the time
in units of years.

11
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,595
But what is the time Î”

12
00:00:50,795 --> 00:00:54,757
in units of years between say,
the calendar dates

13
00:00:55,092 --> 00:00:59,467
4th of January, 2000 and the
4th of July, 2002.

14
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,320
The market in fact evaluates the year
fraction between the calendar dates

15
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,520
t and T in different ways.

16
00:01:08,897 --> 00:01:11,547
These are the day count conventions.

17
00:01:13,115 --> 00:01:16,303
Here are some of the most popular
day count conventions.

18
00:01:17,266 --> 00:01:20,078
Actual over 365.

19
00:01:20,278 --> 00:01:24,303
Here the year has 365 days and

20
00:01:24,503 --> 00:01:27,440
the year fraction is given by the
actual number of days

21
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:30,115
between the calendar dates t and T

22
00:01:30,453 --> 00:01:32,841
divided by 365.

23
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:36,041
Another convention is actual 
over 360.

24
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:40,917
It's as above but the year 
counts 360 days.

25
00:01:43,676 --> 00:01:47,801
Then there is the 
30 over 360 convention.

26
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:51,923
Here every month counts 30 days

27
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:55,446
and years count 360 days.

28
00:01:56,514 --> 00:02:00,502
That is, formally speaking, 
for calendar dates t

29
00:02:00,702 --> 00:02:03,939
which is day 1, month 1, year 1

30
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:07,702
and T which is day 2, month 2,
year 2.

31
00:02:08,267 --> 00:02:11,954
We have to cap the 31st

32
00:02:13,778 --> 00:02:15,141
of the months

33
00:02:16,175 --> 00:02:20,100
otherwise we divide the difference
of months by 12

34
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,688
and the difference of the years
they counted 14.

35
00:02:25,427 --> 00:02:29,002
It is best to look at an example and

36
00:02:29,402 --> 00:02:31,690
resume the calendar dates

37
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:36,977
the 4th of January, 2000 
and the 4th of July 2002.

38
00:02:37,766 --> 00:02:42,591
The time between these 2 dates
amounts to 2.5

39
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:45,977
in the 30 over 360 convention

40
00:02:46,485 --> 00:02:49,560
And then the actual over 365
convention

41
00:02:50,495 --> 00:02:55,432
the time amounts to 2.4986.

42
00:02:57,002 --> 00:03:01,102
Note that while this may look
like a tiny difference,

43
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:04,183
remember that the outstanding
notional

44
00:03:04,588 --> 00:03:08,150
in this interest rate contract
is huge.

45
00:03:08,495 --> 00:03:11,945
So even a 2nd digit difference

46
00:03:12,579 --> 00:03:16,179
in the day count convention
can translate

47
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:20,471
into thousands of units
of currency.

48
00:03:22,223 --> 00:03:26,373
Recall that the coupon bond
price is given

49
00:03:26,573 --> 00:03:29,048
as X dividend cost.

50
00:03:30,989 --> 00:03:32,251
That means

51
00:03:33,023 --> 00:03:38,060
there are systematic discontinuities
of the bond price trajectory

52
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:40,135
at the coupon payment dates.

53
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:44,537
For illustration, look at
this stylized example

54
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:48,501
of a bond with maturity of 5 years,

55
00:03:48,697 --> 00:03:53,410
annual coupons of 5 percent
on the principle of 100.

56
00:03:56,079 --> 00:03:58,817
The price of the bond typically

57
00:03:59,314 --> 00:04:02,689
increases towards the first
coupon payment

58
00:04:02,889 --> 00:04:08,177
and then is suddenly reduced
by the payment of 5.

59
00:04:09,008 --> 00:04:12,321
And then again increases
to the next coupon payment,

60
00:04:13,391 --> 00:04:16,578
jumps down by 5 and so on
and so forth

61
00:04:16,778 --> 00:04:20,903
until you arrive at 
the principle 100.

62
00:04:23,947 --> 00:04:28,634
In order to remedy these price
trajectory jumps

63
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:36,098
you compute what is called the 
accrued interest on the coupon C-i.

64
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:41,189
It is given by this following

65
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:45,202
pro rata formula.

66
00:04:47,776 --> 00:04:52,901
If we subtract the accrued interest
from the X dividend bond price

67
00:04:53,437 --> 00:04:56,162
we arrive at what we call
the clean price.

68
00:04:56,782 --> 00:05:01,395
The clean price in our 
stylized example

69
00:05:01,686 --> 00:05:06,724
will have a smooth trajectory
bringing us down to the principle

70
00:05:07,612 --> 00:05:09,025
of 100.

71
00:05:10,325 --> 00:05:14,987
Dirty price in turn is what we call
X dividend bond price

72
00:05:15,532 --> 00:05:19,995
which in terms of the clean price is 
given by adding the accrued interest.

73
00:05:21,184 --> 00:05:24,471
The clean price is sometimes

74
00:05:25,273 --> 00:05:26,436
what is quoted.

75
00:05:27,324 --> 00:05:31,724
In any case, the dirty price is
definitely what you will have to pay.
