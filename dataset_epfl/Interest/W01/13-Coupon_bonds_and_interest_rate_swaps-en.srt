1
00:00:05,585 --> 00:00:08,585
Bonds with maturity beyond a year
typically pay coupons.

2
00:00:10,733 --> 00:00:14,321
In case these coupons are fixed
we speak of fixed coupon bonds.

3
00:00:15,369 --> 00:00:19,757
In case these coupons are floating
we speak of floating rate notes.

4
00:00:21,592 --> 00:00:24,267
An interest rate swap
exchanges the cash flows,

5
00:00:25,540 --> 00:00:28,952
of fixed coupon bonds
and a floating rate note.

6
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:33,372
A fixed coupon bond
or simply coupon bond

7
00:00:33,968 --> 00:00:39,618
is specified by coupon dates
T1, T2 up to Tn

8
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,055
where Tn is also called the maturity
of the bond.

9
00:00:44,768 --> 00:00:47,418
It is also specified
by fixed coupon payments,

10
00:00:48,647 --> 00:00:51,597
C1, C2, and so on...

11
00:00:54,866 --> 00:00:56,191
and so on...

12
00:00:57,748 --> 00:00:59,998
Being paid at the coupon dates,

13
00:01:00,412 --> 00:01:06,324
Ti and the bonds also comes
with a principal value N

14
00:01:07,772 --> 00:01:10,547
that is paid at the maturity.

15
00:01:11,785 --> 00:01:14,135
Given what we know about
discount bonds,

16
00:01:15,024 --> 00:01:18,187
we can now determine
the price

17
00:01:19,203 --> 00:01:24,503
of these coupon bonds
at a calendar date "t".

18
00:01:26,064 --> 00:01:29,064
It is given by multiplying
these cash flows

19
00:01:29,835 --> 00:01:33,885
by the respective discount bond
and summing up.

20
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,668
We follow here the convention, that
if the calendar date T

21
00:01:40,531 --> 00:01:43,031
coincides with one
of the coupon dates,

22
00:01:43,717 --> 00:01:49,792
then the coupon itself is not
full part of the price anymore.

23
00:01:50,184 --> 00:01:53,559
In other words the price
is ex-dividend.

24
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:58,339
A floating rate note is specified
by a sequence

25
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:03,240
reset and settlement dates
Tnot, T1 up to Tn.

26
00:02:04,555 --> 00:02:07,918
Where again, Tn is the maturity
of the note.

27
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:12,161
While Tnot is the first
reset date.

28
00:02:13,856 --> 00:02:18,968
Again, the principal is paid
at the maturity.

29
00:02:19,575 --> 00:02:23,013
The coupon payments
now are floating.

30
00:02:23,876 --> 00:02:26,851
That means (INAUDIBLE) T1,

31
00:02:27,653 --> 00:02:33,166
there is a coupon paid
which is fixed at Tnot

32
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:40,033
The same at T2, there is a coupon
paid which is fixed at T1.

33
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,748
So on and so forth.

34
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:44,859
Until the last coupon
has been paid.

35
00:02:51,595 --> 00:02:54,595
So, notice that at Tnot
there is not cash flow,

36
00:02:55,107 --> 00:02:57,307
Tnot is simply a reset date.

37
00:02:58,065 --> 00:03:01,315
The price of the floating
rate note,

38
00:03:02,171 --> 00:03:05,833
at any calendar date small "t"
prior to Tnot,

39
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,896
is surprisingly simple.

40
00:03:11,487 --> 00:03:15,987
It is given by the Tnot bond price
times the principal N.

41
00:03:26,193 --> 00:03:29,843
We proof this price formula
by constructing

42
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:32,201
a self-financing strategy,

43
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:36,716
Which has the initial cost
equal to the price,

44
00:03:37,786 --> 00:03:41,786
and which yields the same
cash flow as the floating rate note.

45
00:03:43,018 --> 00:03:46,181
Absence of arbitrage, that implies
that this initial cost<

46
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:48,305
must indeed be equal to the price.

47
00:03:49,976 --> 00:03:55,738
The initial cost is
N x Tnot bond price.

48
00:03:57,671 --> 00:04:02,833
With this amount of money
we can buy N Tnot bonds.

49
00:04:03,593 --> 00:04:06,481
We hold them until Tnot,

50
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:12,172
and each of the bonds wil pay us
one unit of currency.

51
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:15,825
So, in total we get N

52
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:24,024
We then use this amount
and invest it in T1 bonds

53
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,998
How many can we buy?

54
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:33,279
Well, the amount is given by
the money we have 

55
00:04:33,502 --> 00:04:36,827
divided by the price
of a T1 bond.

56
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:41,375
So we pay N

57
00:04:42,633 --> 00:04:46,295
At the time, T1
this T1 bonds

58
00:04:47,144 --> 00:04:53,569
mature and for each
of the bonds we receive one.

59
00:04:53,271 --> 00:04:56,271


60
00:04:54,303 --> 00:04:57,715
We hold that many bonds
so we receive this amount of money.

61
00:04:58,956 --> 00:05:05,818
Which we can write as
sum of the floating coupon,

62
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:07,484
plus the notional.

63
00:05:09,353 --> 00:05:10,703
So we get the notional,

64
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:18,452
and we get the floating coupon.

65
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,943
Now we repeat

66
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,593
and use the money.

67
00:05:28,092 --> 00:05:32,392
N units of currency
and buy T2 bonds

68
00:05:34,822 --> 00:05:40,135
Called into the scheme,
this leads us

69
00:05:40,584 --> 00:05:42,309
Two sequence of cash flows,

70
00:05:43,656 --> 00:05:49,694
where notional income
cancels notional payment,

71
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:54,038
until the maturity.

72
00:05:55,699 --> 00:06:03,524
Where we receive the notional
plus the last floating coupon.

73
00:06:05,176 --> 00:06:08,701
Now you see that the netcare
flows of these strategies,

74
00:06:09,678 --> 00:06:14,503
is exactly matching the cash
flows of the floating rate note,

75
00:06:15,461 --> 00:06:20,311
and that proves that
the initial cost of this strategy

76
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:27,304
is indeed equal to the price
that we saw on the previous slide.

77
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:34,446
When T is equal to the first
reset date,

78
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:40,334
the price of the floating rate note
is simply equal to the notional.

79
00:06:40,953 --> 00:06:46,903
So we can state inverts
that paying the floating coupon

80
00:06:48,356 --> 00:06:53,119
Ci at the coupon dates Ti
and the principal N

81
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:58,233
at the maturity Tn is
equivalent to paying

82
00:06:58,582 --> 00:07:02,032
the principal N at
the first reset date Tnot.

83
00:07:03,558 --> 00:07:06,083
Now suppose you have issued
a floating rate note

84
00:07:07,094 --> 00:07:09,044
so that you have to pay
floating rates.

85
00:07:10,342 --> 00:07:14,992
But you would like to pay
fixed rates instead.

86
00:07:14,937 --> 00:07:17,937


87
00:07:17,002 --> 00:07:19,090
Then you can enter an interest
rate swap.

88
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:24,703
An interest rate swap exchanges
fixed and floating coupon payments.

89
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:29,461
Formally a payer interest rate swap
settles in the rears,

90
00:07:29,857 --> 00:07:33,457
is specified by a sequence of
reset and settlment dates

91
00:07:34,674 --> 00:07:39,999
Tnot up to Tn as we have seen
for the floating rate note,

92
00:07:40,991 --> 00:07:43,729
Tnot is the first reset date
Tn is the maturity,

93
00:07:44,352 --> 00:07:48,527
and Tn minus Tnot is called
the length of the swap.

94
00:07:50,081 --> 00:07:53,931
Further ingredient is a fixed rate K,
a notional N,

95
00:07:54,723 --> 00:07:59,173
and for simplicity here, we assume
that these time points

96
00:07:59,844 --> 00:08:03,044
are equally distant
with constant difference Delta

97
00:08:05,779 --> 00:08:08,579
The holder of this payer
interest rates swap,

98
00:08:09,985 --> 00:08:12,985
will pay a fixed rate K

99
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:20,379
at the payment dates T1,
T2 up to TN,

100
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:27,793
and in turn receives the floating
rates on there dates.

101
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:34,785
The net cash flows are exactly
the same as you would get

102
00:08:35,533 --> 00:08:38,295
from holding a floating rate note,

103
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:43,456
and being short a fixed
coupon bond, so the value

104
00:08:44,032 --> 00:08:49,482
of the payer interest rates swap
at date small "t"

105
00:08:50,089 --> 00:08:56,064
is given by the difference
of the value of the floating rate note,

106
00:08:58,167 --> 00:09:02,792
minus the value
of the coupon bond.

107
00:09:06,797 --> 00:09:10,472
Is an easy exercise using
the definition of forward rates

108
00:09:10,914 --> 00:09:13,739
expressed in terms
of cero coupn bonds

109
00:09:14,165 --> 00:09:16,903
to show that this can be
rewritten in this form.

110
00:09:18,984 --> 00:09:20,722
Notice that when N is one

111
00:09:21,622 --> 00:09:24,622
that is when there is only
one cash flow date,

112
00:09:25,617 --> 00:09:29,680
this is exactly the same
as a forward rate agreement.

113
00:09:31,049 --> 00:09:33,299
Now, the value of a receiver
interest rate swap,

114
00:09:34,117 --> 00:09:38,254
it is just the counter part disposition
to a payer interest rate swap.

115
00:09:39,026 --> 00:09:44,664
Is as given by negative of the value
of the payer interest rates swap.

116
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:49,608
Now again there is a unique
fixed rate K,

117
00:09:49,915 --> 00:09:54,115
which makes the value of the payer
and receiver interest rate swaps

118
00:09:54,906 --> 00:09:55,806
equal to cero.

119
00:09:56,873 --> 00:10:01,485
This fixed rate is called
The Swap Rate.

120
00:10:02,453 --> 00:10:04,028
Prevailing at co-lender date T.

121
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,431
Now if T is strictly smaller
than Tnot,

122
00:10:08,955 --> 00:10:10,992
we speak of forward swap rate.

123
00:10:11,683 --> 00:10:15,921
If T is equal to Tnot, we speak
of the spot swap rate.

124
00:10:17,267 --> 00:10:22,204
In either case, the expression
is given by this formula.

125
00:10:23,127 --> 00:10:25,340
I leave it as an exercise to you.

126
00:10:26,207 --> 00:10:30,620
To derive these equivalent
alternative expression,

127
00:10:31,934 --> 00:10:33,959
with weight W high.

128
00:10:36,372 --> 00:10:41,597
Another simple exercise for you
is to proof this Lemma

129
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,420
Which states that a coupon bond
has par value at Tnot.

130
00:10:49,369 --> 00:10:52,582
If and only these coupon rates
are equal

131
00:10:53,213 --> 00:10:55,188
to the corresponding swap rate.

132
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:57,573


133
00:10:56,027 --> 00:10:58,852
Formally speaking, this identity.

134
00:11:01,157 --> 00:11:07,882
Interest rate swaps trade
from different starting dates Tnot.

135
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:10,752
And for various lengths,

136
00:11:11,718 --> 00:11:17,518
this tamble gives an example
of market quotes for swap rates.

137
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,583


138
00:11:18,453 --> 00:11:22,103
These are Euro swap rates,
expressed in percentage points,

139
00:11:23,723 --> 00:11:26,148
from end of August 2013.

140
00:11:27,397 --> 00:11:29,947
The Euros zone swap
pay annual coupons

141
00:11:30,456 --> 00:11:31,818
that is Delta is 1.

142
00:11:32,889 --> 00:11:35,614
We see here in the first column,

143
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:43,995
the spot swap rates as function
of the length of the swap. 

144
00:11:46,981 --> 00:11:49,193
We get the term structure
of swap rates.

145
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:53,846
Similarly, we get the term
structure of swap rates,

146
00:11:56,113 --> 00:11:59,138
for swaps starting
in one year from now.

147
00:11:59,842 --> 00:12:01,004
And so on and so forth.

148
00:12:02,857 --> 00:12:05,645
Now, interest rates swap markets
are over the counter.

149
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:09,700
They are not exchanged traded.

150
00:12:10,812 --> 00:12:13,874
But the swap contracts exist
in stand that is form.

151
00:12:14,957 --> 00:12:19,645
For example, by the International
Swaps and Deivatives Association.

152
00:12:20,968 --> 00:12:23,493
Swap markets, therefore
are extremely liquid,

153
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:27,028
and the outstading notional
is very large.

154
00:12:28,194 --> 00:12:31,194
Tha maturiries or the length
of the swap,

155
00:12:31,855 --> 00:12:35,080
range from 1 to 30 years,
which is standard,

156
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:39,833
and quotes of sweap rates
