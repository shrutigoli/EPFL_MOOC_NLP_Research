000:00:04,159 --> 00:00:05,509So, good morning.100:00:05,925 --> 00:00:07,924We are here again to continue200:00:08,099 --> 00:00:11,225in the Module 4 of the course300:00:11,417 --> 00:00:12,892on implementation research.400:00:13,082 --> 00:00:13,944So, today we will be500:00:14,128 --> 00:00:15,453continuing in this same vein600:00:15,646 --> 00:00:17,882and we will be looking at examples700:00:18,092 --> 00:00:20,705of implementation research outcomes.800:00:20,905 --> 00:00:22,404This chapter has been divided900:00:22,591 --> 00:00:24,129into 3 sections.1000:00:24,436 --> 00:00:26,047The first section will describe1100:00:26,239 --> 00:00:28,188common constructs that have been used1200:00:28,371 --> 00:00:30,110as implementation research outcomes.1300:00:30,298 --> 00:00:31,811Then, in the second chapter,1400:00:31,989 --> 00:00:33,164we will describe the relevance1500:00:33,365 --> 00:00:34,091of different1600:00:34,276 --> 00:00:35,775implementation research outcomes1700:00:35,967 --> 00:00:37,367for different stages1800:00:37,543 --> 00:00:39,031of implementation research.1900:00:39,377 --> 00:00:40,827Before we proceed,2000:00:41,081 --> 00:00:42,831it's now a practice,2100:00:43,003 --> 00:00:44,590we're going to do some quizzes2200:00:45,316 --> 00:00:47,441to kind of help us to gauge2300:00:47,858 --> 00:00:50,433our knowledge and to also present2400:00:50,627 --> 00:00:52,265some of the key messages2500:00:52,449 --> 00:00:53,573that we will be presenting2600:00:53,752 --> 00:00:54,989in this chapter.2700:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,599So, I would like you to take your pen2800:00:56,810 --> 00:00:58,022and your paper2900:00:58,298 --> 00:00:59,473and to answer true or false3000:00:59,654 --> 00:01:00,867to the following questions.3100:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,472The first question:3200:01:02,652 --> 00:01:04,827The following are examples of3300:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,773implementation research outcomes:3400:01:07,526 --> 00:01:11,551mortality, morbidity, and disease incidence.3500:01:12,960 --> 00:01:14,285Question 2:3600:01:14,465 --> 00:01:16,427Implementation research outcomes3700:01:16,620 --> 00:01:18,845are only single-domain constructs3800:01:19,082 --> 00:01:21,619and are heuristically defined.3900:01:23,538 --> 00:01:24,713Question 3:4000:01:24,928 --> 00:01:27,327Implementation fidelity could be assessed4100:01:27,515 --> 00:01:30,615by examining adherence to intervention protocol4200:01:30,821 --> 00:01:32,821and quality of delivery.4300:01:33,958 --> 00:01:35,196Question 4:4400:01:35,372 --> 00:01:37,508Various implementation research outcomes4500:01:37,709 --> 00:01:39,558are relevant for research focused4600:01:39,747 --> 00:01:40,747on different temporal4700:01:40,947 --> 00:01:42,629stages of implementation.4800:01:43,174 --> 00:01:44,424And the last question:4900:01:45,259 --> 00:01:47,221Fidelity measures are some of5000:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,871the most common implementation research outcomes5100:01:50,072 --> 00:01:53,071used in assessing health system readiness.5200:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,684We'll begin Section 1 by looking5300:01:54,872 --> 00:01:56,259at common constructs that5400:01:56,471 --> 00:01:57,259are being used5500:01:57,572 --> 00:01:58,872in public health studies5600:01:59,047 --> 00:02:00,997as implementation research outcomes.5700:02:01,497 --> 00:02:02,721I would like to clarify that these5800:02:02,897 --> 00:02:04,246are not the only constructs that5900:02:04,434 --> 00:02:05,908could be used or that are examples6000:02:06,109 --> 00:02:07,472of implementation research6100:02:08,014 --> 00:02:08,652outcomes.6200:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,063But these are the common ones6300:02:10,251 --> 00:02:12,064that you'll find across the literature6400:02:12,267 --> 00:02:14,380not only for infectious diseases6500:02:14,584 --> 00:02:16,409of poverty, but also across6600:02:16,591 --> 00:02:18,817different areas of public health.6700:02:19,169 --> 00:02:20,369So, to the first construct,6800:02:20,552 --> 00:02:22,077which is acceptability.6900:02:22,255 --> 00:02:23,555That we defined as7000:02:23,736 --> 00:02:25,636the perception among stakeholders7100:02:25,897 --> 00:02:28,296that an intervention is agreeable.7200:02:28,659 --> 00:02:29,683So it's this whole idea7300:02:29,871 --> 00:02:31,283that people find7400:02:31,488 --> 00:02:33,138the way in which an intervention7500:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,014is delivered to be agreeable.7600:02:35,198 --> 00:02:36,747They have some level of comfort7700:02:36,933 --> 00:02:38,422or some satisfaction7800:02:38,621 --> 00:02:39,733with different aspects7900:02:39,909 --> 00:02:41,283of implementation activities8000:02:41,471 --> 00:02:42,871around the delivery8100:02:43,059 --> 00:02:44,346of an intervention.8200:02:44,538 --> 00:02:47,525That has been called by other terms8300:02:47,727 --> 00:02:48,888including comfort,8400:02:49,134 --> 00:02:51,484relative advantage and credibility.8500:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,445So, again to the example that8600:02:53,633 --> 00:02:55,571we used earlier on in Chapter 18700:02:55,766 --> 00:02:57,415we had said that in testing8800:02:57,609 --> 00:02:58,446the impact8900:02:58,634 --> 00:02:59,696of different strategies9000:02:59,891 --> 00:03:02,040on the delivery of9100:03:02,234 --> 00:03:04,172an evidence based intervention9200:03:04,359 --> 00:03:06,284that we could use acceptability9300:03:06,484 --> 00:03:09,558to compare one strategy to another.9400:03:09,744 --> 00:03:11,582We could say to some extent9500:03:11,771 --> 00:03:13,183that implementation activities9600:03:13,372 --> 00:03:15,721are successful when we have9700:03:15,909 --> 00:03:18,549better acceptability of a strategy9800:03:18,747 --> 00:03:19,734compared to another.9900:03:19,988 --> 00:03:21,375Adoption has been defined here10000:03:21,571 --> 00:03:22,796as the intention or10100:03:22,978 --> 00:03:24,078the initial decision10200:03:24,271 --> 00:03:25,970to try out an intervention.10300:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,946So it's this whole idea that10400:03:28,123 --> 00:03:29,373you contemplate to try out10500:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,535an intervention10600:03:30,704 --> 00:03:32,953and you eventually make the decision10700:03:33,134 --> 00:03:34,509to do the intervention10800:03:34,697 --> 00:03:37,259and then in the phases10900:03:37,446 --> 00:03:38,959where you are beginning to test out11000:03:39,146 --> 00:03:39,920the intervention.11100:03:40,108 --> 00:03:41,846So all that is the measure of adoption.11200:03:42,052 --> 00:03:43,176For instance even11300:03:43,372 --> 00:03:45,346by virtue of a new strategy11400:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,891people in a particular community11500:03:48,296 --> 00:03:50,459are able to adopt some intervention11600:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,696compared to some other community.11700:03:52,896 --> 00:03:54,808That, in a way, is useful11800:03:54,997 --> 00:03:56,559for testing whether these sorts of11900:03:56,746 --> 00:03:57,959implementation activities12000:03:58,144 --> 00:03:59,882have worked or not.12100:04:00,182 --> 00:04:01,945Appropriateness is the perceived fit12200:04:02,137 --> 00:04:04,511or the relevance of an intervention12300:04:04,689 --> 00:04:06,514even in a particular setting.12400:04:07,454 --> 00:04:09,504So this whole idea that because of12500:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,796the way an intervention is designed,12600:04:12,138 --> 00:04:13,299because of the make-up12700:04:13,479 --> 00:04:14,841of a particular context in which12800:04:15,031 --> 00:04:16,167the intervention is going to12900:04:16,353 --> 00:04:17,316be delivered,13000:04:17,506 --> 00:04:19,631that you could begin to imagine13100:04:19,825 --> 00:04:21,188that that would be a good fit13200:04:21,375 --> 00:04:23,013of an intervention13300:04:23,182 --> 00:04:24,414into the new setting13400:04:24,593 --> 00:04:25,656that you are intending to13500:04:25,837 --> 00:04:27,062implement the intervention.13600:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,362And that, in a way,13700:04:28,543 --> 00:04:29,630is also a measure13800:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,380of your implementation activities13900:04:31,589 --> 00:04:32,702because you could say that14000:04:32,875 --> 00:04:33,287in places14100:04:33,470 --> 00:04:33,876where you14200:04:34,063 --> 00:04:35,226have high appropriateness14300:04:35,406 --> 00:04:36,368you're going to achieve14400:04:36,561 --> 00:04:37,924effective implementation and14500:04:38,121 --> 00:04:40,147therefore achieve effective results.14600:04:40,334 --> 00:04:41,084Feasibility.14700:04:41,263 --> 00:04:42,675It's perhaps a very common construct14800:04:42,871 --> 00:04:43,683that has been used14900:04:43,871 --> 00:04:45,096in study15000:04:45,284 --> 00:04:46,746of implementation research.15100:04:46,933 --> 00:04:47,958Here it is defined15200:04:48,141 --> 00:04:49,541as the extent to which15300:04:49,734 --> 00:04:51,258an intervention can be carried out15400:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,684in a particular setting15500:04:52,883 --> 00:04:54,258or organization.15600:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,150So you see here it's different15700:04:56,326 --> 00:04:57,638from appropriateness in that15800:04:57,828 --> 00:04:58,941appropriateness looks at15900:04:59,131 --> 00:05:00,057the perceived fit16000:05:00,246 --> 00:05:01,834while here in feasibility we're16100:05:02,034 --> 00:05:03,284actually measuring 16200:05:03,482 --> 00:05:06,356the actual fit of the intervention16300:05:06,538 --> 00:05:08,338into the new setting.16400:05:08,531 --> 00:05:09,705That is to say that we can not16500:05:09,889 --> 00:05:11,989measure feasibility without actually16600:05:12,177 --> 00:05:13,765delivering the intervention and16700:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,559usually this measure is taken16800:05:15,747 --> 00:05:17,071at the very early phases16900:05:17,272 --> 00:05:18,721of an implementation activity.17000:05:18,901 --> 00:05:21,725So we think about our pilot studies17100:05:21,913 --> 00:05:23,188that look about what is17200:05:23,401 --> 00:05:25,488the likelihood of success if we do17300:05:25,721 --> 00:05:27,684this intervention in a new setting.17400:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,800The likelihood of success might be17500:05:29,985 --> 00:05:31,635determined by looking at the cost17600:05:31,824 --> 00:05:33,508or might be determined by looking17700:05:33,699 --> 00:05:34,624at the acceptability17800:05:34,807 --> 00:05:36,432of the intervention or may17900:05:36,602 --> 00:05:37,739be determined by looking18000:05:37,925 --> 00:05:39,925at how effective it was18100:05:40,115 --> 00:05:41,965for the stakeholders and18200:05:42,153 --> 00:05:44,265the main actors in being able18300:05:44,465 --> 00:05:45,927to deliver the actual intervention18400:05:46,117 --> 00:05:47,417to the population that needs it.18500:05:47,601 --> 00:05:49,364So all of these together18600:05:49,552 --> 00:05:51,115are measures of feasibility.18700:05:51,322 --> 00:05:52,571And  you  would see from18800:05:52,759 --> 00:05:54,434the elaborations that are provided18900:05:54,622 --> 00:05:56,159that there are different domains19000:05:56,344 --> 00:05:57,294that can be used 19100:05:57,475 --> 00:05:58,750to measure feasibility.19200:05:58,936 --> 00:06:00,261For instance I mentioned cost,19300:06:00,449 --> 00:06:02,361I mentioned acceptability,19400:06:02,536 --> 00:06:06,573I mentioned the degree of execution19500:06:06,759 --> 00:06:07,809of the intervention.19600:06:07,994 --> 00:06:09,332So all of these domains could be19700:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,707together used to measure feasibility.19800:06:11,891 --> 00:06:13,715That is to say that the definition19900:06:13,903 --> 00:06:15,378comes by experience.20000:06:16,264 --> 00:06:18,639It really comes by the reason of20100:06:18,966 --> 00:06:20,428doing of the intervention or20200:06:20,616 --> 00:06:22,328doing of the activity and therefore20300:06:22,518 --> 00:06:24,106you're able to define this construct20400:06:24,294 --> 00:06:26,556based on the actual experience20500:06:26,742 --> 00:06:28,118of implementation.20600:06:28,314 --> 00:06:29,413Put in another way,20700:06:29,601 --> 00:06:30,689these outcomes20800:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,198are heuristically defined.20900:06:32,376 --> 00:06:33,314Let's move on.21000:06:33,501 --> 00:06:34,426Still talking about21100:06:34,614 --> 00:06:36,576the common examples of constructs21200:06:36,772 --> 00:06:37,710that are being used21300:06:37,897 --> 00:06:39,823as implementation research outcomes.21400:06:40,173 --> 00:06:41,885The next common construct that we21500:06:42,082 --> 00:06:44,345are going to talk about is fidelity.21600:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,528So, fidelity is the degree to which21700:06:46,716 --> 00:06:48,566an intervention was implemented21800:06:48,753 --> 00:06:49,540as it was designed,21900:06:49,726 --> 00:06:51,151in an original protocol,22000:06:51,346 --> 00:06:53,108plan or policy.22100:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,660That is to say that for every22200:06:54,846 --> 00:06:56,859evidence based intervention there is22300:06:57,067 --> 00:06:58,554a way in which the intervention22400:06:58,742 --> 00:07:00,492was designed or there is a way22500:07:00,682 --> 00:07:01,881in which the intervention was22600:07:02,082 --> 00:07:03,444originally delivered when it22700:07:03,632 --> 00:07:05,306was being tested for effectiveness.22800:07:05,507 --> 00:07:07,582So fidelity is being able22900:07:07,769 --> 00:07:10,069to carry out that intervention23000:07:10,268 --> 00:07:10,942in the way23100:07:11,133 --> 00:07:12,496that it was originally designed23200:07:12,717 --> 00:07:13,791in the original protocol23300:07:13,963 --> 00:07:15,163by the designer.23400:07:15,349 --> 00:07:16,936So anything that deviates 23500:07:17,132 --> 00:07:19,282from the main protocol or23600:07:19,482 --> 00:07:21,082that deviates from the way23700:07:21,278 --> 00:07:22,516in  which the intervention23800:07:22,698 --> 00:07:24,660was originally designed would be23900:07:24,856 --> 00:07:26,618a deviation in fidelity.24000:07:26,817 --> 00:07:28,279So there are several other names24100:07:28,467 --> 00:07:30,579by which fidelity has been described24200:07:30,767 --> 00:07:31,529in the literature24300:07:31,714 --> 00:07:32,952including adherence,24400:07:33,141 --> 00:07:34,354delivery as intended,24500:07:34,540 --> 00:07:37,377integrity, quality of delivery,24600:07:37,569 --> 00:07:39,269intensity, dosage,24700:07:39,467 --> 00:07:40,492and so on and so forth.24800:07:40,683 --> 00:07:42,820But it's important to also highlight24900:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,020that for fidelity25000:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,545just like feasibility it is25100:07:46,745 --> 00:07:48,095a multi-domain construct25200:07:48,278 --> 00:07:49,840because you have different domains25300:07:50,024 --> 00:07:51,711that contribute to25400:07:51,899 --> 00:07:55,587the measure that we call fidelity.25500:07:55,799 --> 00:07:57,198Implementation cost is25600:07:57,378 --> 00:07:58,977the incremental cost25700:07:59,153 --> 00:08:00,990to deliver an intervention25800:08:01,167 --> 00:08:02,430in a new setting.25900:08:02,608 --> 00:08:04,333All the cost that is associated26000:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,770with the implementation activities26100:08:06,968 --> 00:08:09,018to carry out an intervention26200:08:09,205 --> 00:08:09,905in a new setting26300:08:10,092 --> 00:08:12,067will be implementation cost.26400:08:12,264 --> 00:08:14,214This is a single domain or construct26500:08:14,402 --> 00:08:15,414because it looks simply26600:08:15,589 --> 00:08:16,876at monetary value26700:08:17,074 --> 00:08:18,549of a set of activities26800:08:18,728 --> 00:08:20,515to do26900:08:20,703 --> 00:08:22,190an intervention in a new setting.27000:08:22,380 --> 00:08:23,567Penetration talks about27100:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,446this whole idea of the vertical scale-up27200:08:26,644 --> 00:08:27,681of an intervention27300:08:27,871 --> 00:08:29,395within a particular system.27400:08:29,593 --> 00:08:30,893For example, let's imagine27500:08:31,087 --> 00:08:32,374that an intervention can only27600:08:32,560 --> 00:08:33,122be delivered27700:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,958at the health facility level.27800:08:35,203 --> 00:08:36,840Penetration will look at how many27900:08:37,043 --> 00:08:38,830of the different health facilities28000:08:39,052 --> 00:08:41,114in a new setting have actually28100:08:41,304 --> 00:08:42,792carried out the evidence28200:08:42,992 --> 00:08:44,479with practice.28300:08:44,795 --> 00:08:46,469It's going to be a measure or28400:08:46,660 --> 00:08:48,498penetration of this vertical28500:08:48,688 --> 00:08:50,100scale up of an intervention.28600:08:50,289 --> 00:08:51,464And it's slightly different28700:08:51,652 --> 00:08:52,915from coverage which is really28800:08:53,113 --> 00:08:54,075looking at the spread28900:08:54,254 --> 00:08:55,754of the intervention29000:08:55,946 --> 00:08:56,946within the community29100:08:57,140 --> 00:08:59,339or within the eligible population29200:08:59,529 --> 00:09:00,878that needs the intervention.29300:09:01,067 --> 00:09:02,542That is to say that what proportion29400:09:02,730 --> 00:09:04,217of an eligible population29500:09:04,416 --> 00:09:05,341that should receive29600:09:05,522 --> 00:09:06,447an intervention29700:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,230actually receives it.29800:09:08,420 --> 00:09:10,620Next and last, but not the least29900:09:10,801 --> 00:09:12,025is sustainability.30000:09:12,228 --> 00:09:13,615Here we define sustainability30100:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,790as the extent to which30200:09:14,981 --> 00:09:16,442an intervention is maintained30300:09:16,631 --> 00:09:17,867or institutionalized30400:09:18,058 --> 00:09:19,258in a given setting.30500:09:19,468 --> 00:09:21,117That is to say that this whole idea30600:09:21,303 --> 00:09:22,515of being able to integrate30700:09:22,703 --> 00:09:24,577an evidence based intervention30800:09:24,771 --> 00:09:27,258along with these implementation activities30900:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,514within the larger framework or31000:09:29,714 --> 00:09:30,926the larger health system31100:09:31,128 --> 00:09:33,279or the larger organization setting31200:09:33,465 --> 00:09:34,589in which the intervention31300:09:34,793 --> 00:09:36,194was originally delivered.31400:09:36,393 --> 00:09:37,705This has been called by31500:09:37,891 --> 00:09:38,765several other names31600:09:38,964 --> 00:09:41,052including maintenance,  continuation,31700:09:41,238 --> 00:09:43,937routinization and institutionalization.31800:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,312Obviously there is no particular way31900:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,850of taking this measure.32000:09:49,037 --> 00:09:50,462What is important is to be true32100:09:50,650 --> 00:09:52,450to the paradigm and to be true to32200:09:52,639 --> 00:09:54,189the thinking and to be able to show32300:09:54,377 --> 00:09:56,102the linkages between how these32400:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,939implementation research outcomes32500:09:58,138 --> 00:09:59,700link your intervention and32600:09:59,901 --> 00:10:01,163your evidence based strategy32700:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,464on one hand to the impact that32800:10:03,651 --> 00:10:05,713you hope to see at the population level32900:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,425or in the individual health level on33000:10:07,600 --> 00:10:08,625the other hand.33100:10:08,829 --> 00:10:10,778So before we conclude Section 133200:10:10,966 --> 00:10:12,265we are going to look at some33300:10:12,466 --> 00:10:13,478specific examples33400:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,291of implementation research outcomes33500:10:15,486 --> 00:10:16,936that have been used in TDR33600:10:17,129 --> 00:10:18,428supported grants.33700:10:19,187 --> 00:10:21,111It's important for you to have done33800:10:21,312 --> 00:10:22,874the required reading at this time33900:10:23,062 --> 00:10:24,749because the examples that we're34000:10:24,949 --> 00:10:26,437going to be looking at in the rest34100:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,212of this chapter or Chapter 234200:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,012and also in Chapter 3 are going to34300:10:30,199 --> 00:10:31,136be heavily based34400:10:31,329 --> 00:10:32,554on the required readings.34500:10:32,755 --> 00:10:34,131So if you have not done so already34600:10:34,319 --> 00:10:35,755I would like you to take a pause now34700:10:35,943 --> 00:10:37,956and go to the required reading and34800:10:38,149 --> 00:10:40,061complete the 6 readings before34900:10:40,256 --> 00:10:41,319you move on.35000:10:41,506 --> 00:10:43,093If you have done the readings already35100:10:43,283 --> 00:10:44,359I would like to invite you35200:10:44,559 --> 00:10:45,646to come along with me35300:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,770as we look at these examples.35400:10:47,967 --> 00:10:49,328So the first example that we're35500:10:49,516 --> 00:10:51,591going to look at today is really35600:10:51,792 --> 00:10:54,215the example by Katabarwa et al35700:10:54,403 --> 00:10:56,340and we are looking at community35800:10:56,541 --> 00:10:58,365directed interventions in35900:10:58,558 --> 00:11:00,608an ivermectin maintained control programme.36000:11:00,808 --> 00:11:03,332They looked at this study in Uganda36100:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,445and in Cameroun.36200:11:04,869 --> 00:11:06,345The objective of their study was36300:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,565to assess this strategy and36400:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,777to assess its impact36500:11:09,965 --> 00:11:10,777on the performance36600:11:10,978 --> 00:11:12,615of community health workers.36700:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,147So community directed intervention36800:11:15,348 --> 00:11:16,247is this whole idea36900:11:16,435 --> 00:11:18,460of empowering community37000:11:18,670 --> 00:11:21,947to find solutions to challenges37100:11:22,147 --> 00:11:23,247around implementation37200:11:23,435 --> 00:11:25,272of an evidence based intervention37300:11:25,460 --> 00:11:27,323within their locale.37400:11:27,518 --> 00:11:29,206The idea is that if communities37500:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,297are empowered they're able to direct37600:11:31,494 --> 00:11:33,518appropriate strategy to the area37700:11:33,719 --> 00:11:36,281of interest for their community.37800:11:36,469 --> 00:11:38,518And that in effect will encourage37900:11:38,706 --> 00:11:41,480or allow successful or effective38000:11:41,681 --> 00:11:42,493implementation.38100:11:42,685 --> 00:11:44,346And the idea was that for38200:11:44,544 --> 00:11:46,405the community that underwent38300:11:46,606 --> 00:11:48,794this strategy, they will be trained38400:11:48,997 --> 00:11:51,946in the ability on how to deliver38500:11:52,131 --> 00:11:53,506ivermectin successfully38600:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,163to their community members.38700:11:55,352 --> 00:11:57,451The training will require some costs38800:11:57,651 --> 00:11:59,026and at the end of the day they will38900:11:59,226 --> 00:12:03,151look at coverage of the spread39000:12:03,352 --> 00:12:05,864or the distribution of the ivermectin39100:12:06,064 --> 00:12:08,113within the community where39200:12:08,314 --> 00:12:10,351the strategy is being implemented.39300:12:10,550 --> 00:12:13,362So, in this study coverage is39400:12:13,551 --> 00:12:14,201an example39500:12:14,389 --> 00:12:15,964of implementation research outcome.39600:12:16,163 --> 00:12:17,537So they looked at the proportion39700:12:17,725 --> 00:12:19,124of people who had received39800:12:19,312 --> 00:12:20,062the ivermectin39900:12:20,262 --> 00:12:22,649under the community directed strategy40000:12:22,848 --> 00:12:24,135and they compared it to people40100:12:24,336 --> 00:12:26,197who have received ivermectin40200:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,462under the normal status quo40300:12:28,663 --> 00:12:30,462where ivermectin had been40400:12:30,650 --> 00:12:31,650previously delivered.40500:12:31,845 --> 00:12:33,219They also looked at cost:40600:12:33,412 --> 00:12:35,561cost of delivering40700:12:35,763 --> 00:12:37,975even the community directed strategy40800:12:38,187 --> 00:12:39,050including cost40900:12:39,255 --> 00:12:41,705of the Ivermectin control program41000:12:41,900 --> 00:12:44,075within their community.41100:12:44,287 --> 00:12:45,986The findings were that41200:12:46,175 --> 00:12:48,611mass treatment coverage41300:12:48,812 --> 00:12:50,650with Ivermectin increased41400:12:50,850 --> 00:12:53,662as a result of the CDI strategy and41500:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,962implementation cost reduced over time.41600:12:56,149 --> 00:12:57,998So, in this second example we are41700:12:58,199 --> 00:12:59,637going to be looking at a study41800:12:59,848 --> 00:13:02,410by Akogun et al in Nigeria.41900:13:02,621 --> 00:13:03,895They were looking at how42000:13:04,096 --> 00:13:05,533Nomadic communities42100:13:05,733 --> 00:13:07,170nomadic Fulani communities42200:13:07,358 --> 00:13:10,108treat malaria using some42300:13:10,309 --> 00:13:11,621evidence based intervention42400:13:11,821 --> 00:13:13,033for malaria control.42500:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,905The objective of the study was42600:13:15,106 --> 00:13:17,280to assess the CDI strategy42700:13:17,481 --> 00:13:20,055on how this improved the coverage42800:13:20,255 --> 00:13:22,430and the acceptability of42900:13:22,618 --> 00:13:24,842the malaria control intervention.43000:13:25,043 --> 00:13:26,680So, specifically they were looking43100:13:26,885 --> 00:13:29,096at training, providing training43200:13:29,297 --> 00:13:31,584to Fulani herdsmen on how43300:13:31,785 --> 00:13:33,209to manage malaria43400:13:33,397 --> 00:13:34,572for under 5 children43500:13:34,769 --> 00:13:37,255using artemisinin combination therapy43600:13:37,459 --> 00:13:39,797and also teaching them on how43700:13:39,985 --> 00:13:41,910to properly use bed nets.43800:13:42,396 --> 00:13:43,871In doing this they are going43900:13:44,072 --> 00:13:45,259to encourage the community44000:13:45,461 --> 00:13:47,298to seek pathways or to seek ways44100:13:47,497 --> 00:13:49,296in which they could successfully44200:13:49,485 --> 00:13:51,372deliver the 2 interventions within44300:13:51,572 --> 00:13:52,303their community.44400:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,835So it's this whole idea again44500:13:54,036 --> 00:13:55,335of community directedness.44600:13:55,531 --> 00:13:56,943That is to say the communities44700:13:57,123 --> 00:13:58,697put heads together and44800:13:58,898 --> 00:14:00,835decide on how best 44900:14:01,023 --> 00:14:02,810to deliver an intervention45000:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,170or what is the best strategy45100:14:04,369 --> 00:14:05,682to put in place for the delivery45200:14:05,886 --> 00:14:06,710of an intervention.45300:14:06,911 --> 00:14:08,223And we are going to be looking at45400:14:08,410 --> 00:14:09,160how successful45500:14:09,361 --> 00:14:11,348this community directed strategy45600:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,217is with regards45700:14:12,405 --> 00:14:14,429to the current approach being used45800:14:14,617 --> 00:14:15,730in the health system.45900:14:16,263 --> 00:14:17,837And they measured the test46000:14:18,038 --> 00:14:20,487of this community directed intervention46100:14:20,675 --> 00:14:23,224or strategy by looking at coverage46200:14:23,425 --> 00:14:24,899and also acceptability.46300:14:25,099 --> 00:14:26,848Coverage they looked at to see46400:14:27,038 --> 00:14:29,099whether the people who were under46500:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,387the community directed strategy46600:14:31,587 --> 00:14:34,287had better access or better coverage46700:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,880of the malaria control program.46800:14:37,093 --> 00:14:38,342And they also looked at whether46900:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,167the people that received treatment47000:14:40,355 --> 00:14:41,542from community members47100:14:41,730 --> 00:14:43,242found this agreeable or47200:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,329were satisfied with the approach47300:14:45,530 --> 00:14:46,317rather than going47400:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,543to the health facility or going47500:14:48,743 --> 00:14:49,843to the health care worker47600:14:50,053 --> 00:14:51,690to receive the treatment.47700:14:51,906 --> 00:14:53,768And at the end they found that yes,47800:14:53,968 --> 00:14:55,530both malaria control programs47900:14:55,739 --> 00:14:56,689were acceptable to48000:14:56,876 --> 00:14:58,738the nomadic population and there was48100:14:58,944 --> 00:15:00,818an improvement in the coverage overall48200:15:01,021 --> 00:15:02,720with the community directed strategy.48300:15:02,931 --> 00:15:03,943So, in this third example48400:15:04,156 --> 00:15:05,393we are going to be looking at48500:15:05,588 --> 00:15:08,212a study by Akweongo et al and here48600:15:08,406 --> 00:15:09,768we are looking at feasibility48700:15:09,956 --> 00:15:11,380and acceptability48800:15:11,581 --> 00:15:13,280of artemisinin combination therapy.48900:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,805And the study was conducted in Ghana49000:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,485Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and Malawi.49100:15:18,685 --> 00:15:19,823At this point I would like49200:15:20,035 --> 00:15:22,072to emphasize again this idea49300:15:22,285 --> 00:15:23,172that was presented49400:15:23,361 --> 00:15:24,886in the first module [even]49500:15:25,086 --> 00:15:26,848of this course,49600:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,760the idea that implementation research49700:15:28,948 --> 00:15:29,623is often done49800:15:29,811 --> 00:15:30,960in a multi country setting.49900:15:31,161 --> 00:15:32,635That is to say that for us50000:15:32,843 --> 00:15:35,217to establish generalizable evidence50100:15:35,411 --> 00:15:37,298for a set of implementation strategies50200:15:37,495 --> 00:15:39,082or a set of implementation activities,50300:15:39,283 --> 00:15:41,232we have to do it in multiple settings50400:15:41,423 --> 00:15:43,547or in fact do it in multiple countries.50500:15:43,749 --> 00:15:44,923And that's what you see being50600:15:45,123 --> 00:15:46,673demonstrated  by some of the studies50700:15:46,868 --> 00:15:48,768that we are looking at today.50800:15:49,011 --> 00:15:50,599So for the study looking50900:15:50,787 --> 00:15:52,298at feasibility and acceptability51000:15:52,486 --> 00:15:54,223of ACT the objective was to see51100:15:54,431 --> 00:15:56,192how feasible it is to use51200:15:56,393 --> 00:15:59,668even community medicine distributors51300:15:59,855 --> 00:16:02,679for case management of malaria51400:16:02,889 --> 00:16:03,876in urban settings.51500:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,618So the idea is that yes, 51600:16:05,813 --> 00:16:07,749community medecine  distributors51700:16:07,932 --> 00:16:10,457were being used to manage malaria51800:16:10,673 --> 00:16:12,148for under 5 children  in51900:16:12,349 --> 00:16:13,185rural settings.52000:16:13,384 --> 00:16:14,871But thinking about the fact that52100:16:15,074 --> 00:16:16,648more and more countries52200:16:16,848 --> 00:16:18,061in sub-Saharan Africa are52300:16:18,248 --> 00:16:19,372becoming urbanized52400:16:19,567 --> 00:16:21,104so they try to see whether52500:16:21,299 --> 00:16:22,336the same strategy,52600:16:22,535 --> 00:16:23,671that is to use community52700:16:23,872 --> 00:16:25,572medicine distributors to deliver52800:16:25,772 --> 00:16:27,134an evidence based intervention,52900:16:27,335 --> 00:16:28,986would work even in an urban setting.53000:16:29,182 --> 00:16:30,743And then to determine whether53100:16:30,934 --> 00:16:32,271this strategy is going to work53200:16:32,477 --> 00:16:33,539or not or whether this set53300:16:33,735 --> 00:16:35,059of implementation activities53400:16:35,265 --> 00:16:36,677that they are going to put in place53500:16:36,879 --> 00:16:37,604are going to work,53600:16:37,811 --> 00:16:39,223they looked at specific measures53700:16:39,422 --> 00:16:41,034of implementation research outcomes.53800:16:41,237 --> 00:16:43,049They looked at fidelity, that is, to53900:16:43,250 --> 00:16:43,861look at for all54000:16:44,068 --> 00:16:45,193the community medecine54100:16:45,387 --> 00:16:46,900distributors that were trained54200:16:47,087 --> 00:16:48,399to what extent did they deliver54300:16:48,615 --> 00:16:50,002[even] the intervention54400:16:50,212 --> 00:16:51,149as they were trained54500:16:51,344 --> 00:16:52,981according to the protocol in terms54600:16:53,181 --> 00:16:54,430of the dosage, the frequency54700:16:54,631 --> 00:16:55,718by which the children should've54800:16:55,905 --> 00:16:57,119received the intervention.54900:16:57,314 --> 00:16:58,602They also looked at the coverage.55000:16:58,802 --> 00:17:00,551That is to say the number of children55100:17:00,756 --> 00:17:01,818who should receive55200:17:02,023 --> 00:17:03,048the malaria treatment,55300:17:03,242 --> 00:17:04,679the appropriate malaria treatment.55400:17:04,865 --> 00:17:06,277How many of them did receive55500:17:06,468 --> 00:17:07,180the treatment?55600:17:07,383 --> 00:17:08,870And then they looked at feasibility.55700:17:09,069 --> 00:17:09,805This whole idea that55800:17:10,006 --> 00:17:11,743it's even possible for us to be able55900:17:11,944 --> 00:17:13,718to do this in an urban setting56000:17:13,917 --> 00:17:14,316at all.56100:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,062Is this actually feasible?56200:17:16,264 --> 00:17:17,151And at the end of the day56300:17:17,368 --> 00:17:18,305they concluded that yes,56400:17:18,506 --> 00:17:20,805 case management of malaria56500:17:21,015 --> 00:17:23,453could actually be done successfully56600:17:23,652 --> 00:17:25,364by community medecine distributors56700:17:25,565 --> 00:17:26,339even in an urban setting56800:17:26,548 --> 00:17:28,822based on the changes in fidelity,56900:17:29,028 --> 00:17:30,977coverage and feasibility.57000:17:31,178 --> 00:17:33,215So for the fourth example we look at57100:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,965a study by Okeibunor et al in Nigeria57200:17:36,166 --> 00:17:38,140and in Togo and Cameroun.57300:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,740They are looking at the use57400:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,977of community-directed distributors57500:17:42,178 --> 00:17:44,052of ivermectin for other57600:17:44,253 --> 00:17:45,703public health control programs.57700:17:45,942 --> 00:17:47,741So this whole idea that yes we have57800:17:47,942 --> 00:17:50,654these community distributors within57900:17:50,855 --> 00:17:52,955villages or rural areas.58000:17:53,154 --> 00:17:54,791That is to say can they be used also58100:17:54,996 --> 00:17:55,807for some other58200:17:55,994 --> 00:17:57,143public health programming58300:17:57,338 --> 00:17:58,512including [areas] like sanitation,58400:17:58,713 --> 00:18:00,513immunization activities and so on?58500:18:00,705 --> 00:18:02,254And does this inclusion58600:18:02,451 --> 00:18:05,262negatively impact the activities58700:18:05,463 --> 00:18:06,550in delivering58800:18:06,759 --> 00:18:08,558the ivermectin control programme58900:18:08,772 --> 00:18:10,347that they were originally slated for?59000:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,959And in studying this they looked59100:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,671at specific59200:18:13,859 --> 00:18:15,384implementation research outcomes.59300:18:15,586 --> 00:18:16,998First they looked at feasibility.59400:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,071That is to say is it possible at all59500:18:19,281 --> 00:18:20,718to actually incorporate59600:18:20,914 --> 00:18:21,938additional tasks59700:18:22,137 --> 00:18:24,573for these community distributors59800:18:24,783 --> 00:18:26,308of the ivermectin control programme?59900:18:26,508 --> 00:18:28,120For instance, could they be involved60000:18:28,308 --> 00:18:29,770[even] in sanitation, could they60100:18:29,971 --> 00:18:32,007be involved in immunization and60200:18:32,208 --> 00:18:33,095nutrition programmes60300:18:33,296 --> 00:18:34,171in their community?60400:18:34,367 --> 00:18:35,804And without that negatively60500:18:36,017 --> 00:18:37,965or adversely affecting their work60600:18:38,174 --> 00:18:39,336in ivermectin control?60700:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,964And they also looked at coverage.60800:18:41,171 --> 00:18:42,107That is to say that60900:18:42,307 --> 00:18:43,794does the proportion of people61000:18:43,997 --> 00:18:45,722that received ivermectin change61100:18:45,916 --> 00:18:47,140with the inclusion61200:18:47,349 --> 00:18:48,948of additional tasks61300:18:49,141 --> 00:18:50,253for these community61400:18:50,472 --> 00:18:51,959distributors in their community?61500:18:52,149 --> 00:18:54,286So, at the end they concluded that yes61600:18:54,498 --> 00:18:55,424involvement of these61700:18:55,624 --> 00:18:57,336community-directed distributors61800:18:57,534 --> 00:18:59,295in other public health activities61900:18:59,499 --> 00:19:00,686even in their community62000:19:00,893 --> 00:19:02,867did not have a negative impact62100:19:03,062 --> 00:19:05,313on the ivermectin control programme.62200:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,149So far we have looked at62300:19:07,357 --> 00:19:09,0814 different examples62400:19:09,288 --> 00:19:11,062of implementation research studies62500:19:11,267 --> 00:19:12,304that were done using62600:19:12,497 --> 00:19:14,685implementation research outcomes62700:19:14,911 --> 00:19:16,736as a measure of effectiveness62800:19:16,961 --> 00:19:18,648of implementation activities62900:19:19,145 --> 00:19:20,207in different parts63000:19:20,397 --> 00:19:21,747of sub-Saharan Africa.63100:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,345When we come back we will continue63200:19:24,548 --> 00:19:25,760with 2 additional examples63300:19:25,968 --> 00:19:26,843and then we will look63400:19:27,051 --> 00:19:28,113at other usefulness63500:19:28,316 --> 00:19:30,191of implementation research outcomes,63600:19:30,387 --> 00:19:30,937such as63700:19:31,139 --> 00:19:32,664implementation research outcomes63800:19:32,871 --> 00:19:34,345being used for the assessment63900:19:34,539 --> 00:19:35,750of health system readiness64000:19:35,944 --> 00:19:36,906and the relevance64100:19:37,112 --> 00:19:39,211of implementation research outcomes64200:19:39,410 --> 00:19:41,771for different stages of implementation64300:19:41,968 --> 00:19:43,993or implementation activities.
