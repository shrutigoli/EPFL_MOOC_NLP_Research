000:00:04,480 --> 00:00:07,305Welcome to the first chapter of module 4100:00:08,284 --> 00:00:11,197where we are looking at implementation research outcomes.200:00:11,409 --> 00:00:13,859For this chapter we are going to focus300:00:14,033 --> 00:00:15,871on making a distinction between400:00:16,075 --> 00:00:18,175intervention efficacy,500:00:18,328 --> 00:00:19,816intervention effectiveness600:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,470and implementation effectiveness.700:00:23,662 --> 00:00:26,174The chapter has been divided into two sections.800:00:26,410 --> 00:00:29,810So in the first section we try to900:00:30,010 --> 00:00:32,872find out why implementation effectiveness1000:00:33,070 --> 00:00:36,182is not the same thing as intervention effectiveness1100:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,175or intervention efficacy.1200:00:38,766 --> 00:00:41,929And then in the second chapter, we are going to be defining1300:00:42,131 --> 00:00:44,069implementation research outcomes.1400:00:44,260 --> 00:00:48,247And we’re going to be conceptualizing them as intermediate outcomes1500:00:48,498 --> 00:00:51,698of population health outcomes or individual health outcomes1600:00:51,910 --> 00:00:54,485like morbidity and mortality.1700:00:54,652 --> 00:00:58,840Before we go on,  I would like you to take a short quiz1800:00:59,607 --> 00:01:01,832to kind of gain our knowledge of the concept1900:01:02,029 --> 00:01:03,754that we'll be presenting today.2000:01:03,941 --> 00:01:06,491If you may, these are some of the key messages2100:01:06,691 --> 00:01:08,703that we would like you to take with you2200:01:08,892 --> 00:01:10,792at the end of this chapter.2300:01:11,843 --> 00:01:14,730So, the first question asks2400:01:14,926 --> 00:01:18,014if implementation effectiveness could be defined2500:01:18,201 --> 00:01:21,926as the impact of an intervention under a controlled setting.2600:01:22,117 --> 00:01:25,142So we would like you to answer true or false to that question.2700:01:27,123 --> 00:01:29,910The second question is asking you2800:01:30,100 --> 00:01:33,438if implementation research outcomes are used to assess2900:01:33,640 --> 00:01:37,728the impact of an intervention on individual or population health.3000:01:40,037 --> 00:01:44,250The third question is asking whether implementation research outcomes3100:01:44,446 --> 00:01:47,383could be conceptualized as the most proximal outcome3200:01:47,583 --> 00:01:49,933of an implementation process.3300:01:51,046 --> 00:01:53,208And then, the last question is asking3400:01:53,425 --> 00:01:56,237if an effective intervention may not lead3500:01:56,416 --> 00:01:58,154to a desired outcome3600:01:58,372 --> 00:02:00,672because of the implementation failure.3700:02:00,905 --> 00:02:03,905So we'd like you to take some time to reflect on these questions3800:02:04,096 --> 00:02:06,583and to answer true or false to these questions.3900:02:07,965 --> 00:02:11,353So we have all seen different examples in literature4000:02:11,544 --> 00:02:14,544Of how an efficacious intervention4100:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,514or an effective intervention does not produce the result4200:02:18,764 --> 00:02:21,089or the impact that we want or we expect to see4300:02:21,292 --> 00:02:23,029within the population.4400:02:23,259 --> 00:02:26,159For example, we know of4500:02:26,373 --> 00:02:29,398the onchocerca volvulus problem in most parts4600:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,140of lower/middle income countries in Africa4700:02:32,343 --> 00:02:34,781and some parts of Latin America.4800:02:34,959 --> 00:02:37,734We know that ivermectin is a very effective drug.	4900:02:37,958 --> 00:02:39,520or very efficacious drug5000:02:39,689 --> 00:02:42,451able to stop the transmission of the microfilariae5100:02:42,624 --> 00:02:45,112that causes this deadly disease.5200:02:46,061 --> 00:02:49,874However, in spite of what we know of the efficacy and of efforts5300:02:50,096 --> 00:02:53,521 that have been made to implement this efficacious intervention5400:02:53,711 --> 00:02:55,036in different settings,5500:02:55,220 --> 00:02:58,032we still have millions of people that are still suffering5600:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,764from "river blindness", which is one of the consequences5700:03:00,964 --> 00:03:03,389 of infestation with onchocerca volvulus.5800:03:03,573 --> 00:03:07,123The question is why does an efficacious intervention5900:03:07,323 --> 00:03:09,961not lead to the widespread impact6000:03:10,154 --> 00:03:11,404that we expect to see?6100:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,075So, most of these questions are actually asking6200:03:14,257 --> 00:03:15,945about implementation failure.6300:03:16,149 --> 00:03:18,161Because it takes more than just having 6400:03:18,362 --> 00:03:21,537an efficacious intervention for you to have the impact 6500:03:21,736 --> 00:03:23,786that you hope to see in the population.6600:03:23,986 --> 00:03:26,586Let's take another example with malaria. 6700:03:26,786 --> 00:03:30,749For instance, with malaria we know that a bed net works6800:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,975in preventing mosquito bites.6900:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,247Mosquito is the vector  that transmits7000:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,865 the plasmodium parasite that  causes malaria.7100:03:38,086 --> 00:03:40,811However, despite investments having been made7200:03:40,995 --> 00:03:43,408into providing bed nets in endemic countries7300:03:43,608 --> 00:03:45,833we still have the scourge of malaria7400:03:46,044 --> 00:03:49,006and millions of children, in fact billions,7500:03:49,206 --> 00:03:52,406millions of billions of people still suffer from malaria7600:03:52,606 --> 00:03:54,419 every year.7700:03:54,615 --> 00:03:56,440So the question yet again is 7800:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,953why does that efficacious intervention7900:03:59,153 --> 00:04:01,778that is to say the insecticide treated bed net8000:04:01,965 --> 00:04:04,340not lead into the population impact8100:04:04,562 --> 00:04:05,849that we hope to see.8200:04:06,030 --> 00:04:08,893Most of these questions are due to implementation failure.8300:04:09,077 --> 00:04:11,927So what we are saying here is that we find that we have8400:04:12,177 --> 00:04:15,502an efficacious intervention  does not necessarily translate8500:04:15,713 --> 00:04:18,463to impact at the population level.8600:04:18,663 --> 00:04:22,376Obviously some sort of activities have to take the intervention8700:04:22,591 --> 00:04:25,591from the laboratory, from the design stage8800:04:25,791 --> 00:04:27,466to the population that needs it.8900:04:27,642 --> 00:04:30,842And these are some of the things that implementation research9000:04:31,028 --> 00:04:32,215 tries to address.9100:04:32,395 --> 00:04:34,232We really try to look at the effectiveness9200:04:34,415 --> 00:04:36,490of the implementation activities9300:04:36,692 --> 00:04:39,305or set of strategies that have been put in place9400:04:39,505 --> 00:04:42,817to deliver an efficacious or an effective intervention.9500:04:43,044 --> 00:04:46,244Let's take a pause to define 9600:04:46,444 --> 00:04:48,406efficacy of an intervention9700:04:48,602 --> 00:04:50,889and to define intervention effectiveness9800:04:51,091 --> 00:04:53,154and distinguish these two definitions9900:04:53,354 --> 00:04:56,141from implementation effectiveness.10000:04:56,341 --> 00:04:59,116So, intervention efficacy.10100:04:59,316 --> 00:05:03,204This is the evidence for the effects of an intervention10200:05:03,387 --> 00:05:05,312under controlled settings.10300:05:05,492 --> 00:05:09,855That is to say that you control all set of implementation activities,10400:05:10,055 --> 00:05:12,380you control the context,10500:05:12,561 --> 00:05:15,548you choose a special10600:05:15,748 --> 00:05:16,898population group10700:05:17,118 --> 00:05:19,743able to test whether an intervention works or not.10800:05:19,943 --> 00:05:23,505For instance, the initial clinical trials10900:05:23,705 --> 00:05:26,705that were done to determine whether ivermectin works11000:05:26,905 --> 00:05:29,393to stop the transmission of microfilariae11100:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,105that causes onchocerciasis, could be an efficacy trial.11200:05:33,305 --> 00:05:36,818The next group is the intervention effectiveness research.11300:05:37,005 --> 00:05:39,430Here you move an efficacious intervention11400:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,255from the controlled setting11500:05:41,455 --> 00:05:43,630and you move it into the general population.11600:05:44,429 --> 00:05:48,204However, you still limit the set of implementation activities11700:05:48,404 --> 00:05:50,866to the barest minimum possible11800:05:51,066 --> 00:05:54,066to successfully implement that efficacious intervention11900:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,379within the general population.12000:05:56,575 --> 00:05:59,587So, you see here, you have moved from a carefully selected12100:05:59,787 --> 00:06:02,662population group to broader population12200:06:02,850 --> 00:06:05,800where the disease for which the intervention has been placed12300:06:06,000 --> 00:06:06,962might be endemic.12400:06:07,162 --> 00:06:10,287However, you still control some of the implementation activities12500:06:10,487 --> 00:06:12,700and the context in which the research is done.12600:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,612Implementation effectiveness, however,12700:06:15,812 --> 00:06:17,862really is focused on generating evidence12800:06:18,036 --> 00:06:21,136for the set of implementation activities or strategies12900:06:21,336 --> 00:06:24,236that you put in place to deliver13000:06:24,436 --> 00:06:27,873an efficacious intervention within a new setting13100:06:28,073 --> 00:06:30,161or within broader population groups13200:06:30,361 --> 00:06:34,561under the real world conditions in which those populations exist.13300:06:35,583 --> 00:06:38,583So for instance, here you are no longer interested13400:06:38,783 --> 00:06:41,770in controlling  the implementation activities or the strategies,13500:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,371or controlling the context.13600:06:43,571 --> 00:06:46,908In fact, that is the focus of your study in most cases.13700:06:47,633 --> 00:06:49,233So let's take a pause here 13800:06:49,433 --> 00:06:51,758and use an example to illustrate what we mean.13900:06:51,971 --> 00:06:54,233So let's go back to the onchocerca volvulus example14000:06:54,433 --> 00:06:55,833that we used earlier on.14100:06:56,047 --> 00:06:59,384We said that conducting clinical trials to determine14200:06:59,584 --> 00:07:02,009the efficacy of ivermectin14300:07:02,209 --> 00:07:04,309on the transmission of microfilariae 14400:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,491would be an example of - intervention efficacy [research]14500:07:07,691 --> 00:07:10,403and then taking that efficacious intervention14600:07:10,575 --> 00:07:13,750 that is the ivermectin, to the population,14700:07:13,950 --> 00:07:16,950maybe you do in a community a trial14800:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,349where you randomly approach  some community to receive ivermectin14900:07:20,562 --> 00:07:23,774and then some other community does not receive ivermectin.15000:07:23,974 --> 00:07:25,362would be an example 15100:07:25,554 --> 00:07:28,679of - intervention effectiveness research.15200:07:28,850 --> 00:07:30,625You see that in this one you take it15300:07:30,815 --> 00:07:32,265 from the controlled setting15400:07:32,437 --> 00:07:35,250into a fairly relaxed setting within broader population.15500:07:35,450 --> 00:07:38,537However, you are still controlling some of the parameters15600:07:38,737 --> 00:07:40,262so that you are able to say 15700:07:40,462 --> 00:07:42,587that the intervention is effective or not.15800:07:42,779 --> 00:07:45,591Now let's move into implementation effectiveness.15900:07:45,791 --> 00:07:48,791Implementation effectiveness now begins to look at strategies16000:07:48,991 --> 00:07:52,279that you can use to disseminate that efficacious...16100:07:52,456 --> 00:07:55,456and effective intervention within broader population.16200:07:55,656 --> 00:07:57,906For instance, let's assume that16300:07:58,106 --> 00:08:00,294in the intervention effectiveness research16400:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,500you have used healthcare providers to provide the ivermectin 16500:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,337to the people that need it.16600:08:05,530 --> 00:08:08,155In implementation effectiveness you might begin to look16700:08:08,367 --> 00:08:10,255at other strategies that may be useful16800:08:10,443 --> 00:08:12,793for doing the same thing in a new setting.16900:08:12,990 --> 00:08:16,015For instance, you might be trying to use community health workers17000:08:16,215 --> 00:08:18,065or you might be trying to use policies17100:08:18,252 --> 00:08:19,590to deliver the same drug17200:08:19,799 --> 00:08:22,086and testing to see the impact 17300:08:22,264 --> 00:08:24,001of these differences in the strategy17400:08:24,236 --> 00:08:26,786would be a focus of implementation effectiveness.17500:08:27,632 --> 00:08:30,632So with this example I hope you are clear17600:08:30,832 --> 00:08:33,345that intervention efficacy is different17700:08:33,545 --> 00:08:35,770from intervention effectiveness and is different17800:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,802from implementation effectiveness.17900:08:37,997 --> 00:08:40,034This thinking is actually central18000:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,590to the conduct of implementation research18100:08:42,793 --> 00:08:45,793and to the whole body of work that is called implementation science.18200:08:45,993 --> 00:08:49,330It's really the deliberate focus on implementation18300:08:49,563 --> 00:08:52,788to take our eyes away momentarily from the intervention18400:08:52,988 --> 00:08:55,413and now only focus on the implementation,18500:08:55,618 --> 00:08:57,918focus on the activities that have been put in place18600:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,868to implement an intervention.18700:09:00,066 --> 00:09:03,066That is the basis or the focus of the implementation research.18800:09:03,991 --> 00:09:07,641Let's go back again to this example that we presented earlier on,18900:09:07,828 --> 00:09:10,578looking at why efficacious intervention19000:09:10,736 --> 00:09:13,736or effective intervention do not generate the impact19100:09:13,936 --> 00:09:16,548 that we hope to see within the population.19200:09:16,731 --> 00:09:19,731So, there are 6 broad categories that we've outlined in this slide.19300:09:20,424 --> 00:09:23,424One of the first examples of implementation failure19400:09:23,624 --> 00:09:26,624or one of the reasons why an efficacious,19500:09:26,824 --> 00:09:29,824 an effective, intervention might not yield the results19600:09:30,024 --> 00:09:31,961 that we expect within the population19700:09:32,148 --> 00:09:35,398is the failure to roll out the intervention in the first place.19800:09:35,598 --> 00:09:38,598So let's imagine that we have this efficacious ivermectin drug19900:09:38,798 --> 00:09:40,998that is just staying in the  lab somewhere20000:09:41,179 --> 00:09:43,817and is really never delivered to the population that needs it20100:09:44,022 --> 00:09:46,134 in parts of Africa or Latin America.20200:09:46,304 --> 00:09:49,304We are really never going to find the impact that we hope to see.20300:09:50,094 --> 00:09:53,482The second example is actually the failure to penetrate20400:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,105the health system.20500:09:55,287 --> 00:09:58,874Imagine that the service for providing ivermectin20600:09:59,074 --> 00:10:01,387is going to be provided through health facilities20700:10:01,548 --> 00:10:03,860and is only restricted to one or two health facilities20800:10:04,072 --> 00:10:05,585within an endemic region.20900:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,770We’ll see  failure in that regard because we have not been able21000:10:08,970 --> 00:10:11,970to reach as many health facilities within the system as possible.21100:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,495So, failure to penetrate a health system21200:10:14,682 --> 00:10:18,282with an efficacious intervention might also be another reason21300:10:18,524 --> 00:10:20,511for implementation failure.21400:10:20,699 --> 00:10:23,486Closely related to that is the lack of coverage21500:10:23,711 --> 00:10:25,911that often is caused with most efficacious21600:10:26,096 --> 00:10:27,846or effective interventions.21700:10:28,064 --> 00:10:30,227That is to say what proportion of people21800:10:30,421 --> 00:10:33,421that are eligible for the intervention are actually getting it.21900:10:33,621 --> 00:10:36,396If an adequate number of people are not getting the intervention22000:10:36,596 --> 00:10:39,821we would not see a mark or a dent even, in the impact22100:10:40,021 --> 00:10:42,183of the intervention  within the population22200:10:42,397 --> 00:10:43,884 that we are interested in.22300:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,079Yet another example is the failure to implement the intervention22400:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,829as prescribed.22500:10:48,996 --> 00:10:51,608So that is to say that when the intervention was designed22600:10:51,788 --> 00:10:53,901it was designed under a particular protocol.22700:10:54,069 --> 00:10:56,519That's an expectation of the dosage or the frequency with 22800:10:56,710 --> 00:10:58,522which the intervention should be delivered.22900:10:58,713 --> 00:11:01,250When you fail to adhere  to some of these steps23000:11:01,434 --> 00:11:04,434and to some of these protocols, the intervention would not produce23100:11:04,634 --> 00:11:07,634the results that you hope to see within the population group.23200:11:09,072 --> 00:11:12,072And then the fifth example here is the failure to reach23300:11:12,272 --> 00:11:13,521the at risk population.23400:11:13,721 --> 00:11:15,996So you could as well go to the entire population23500:11:16,169 --> 00:11:18,432but if you fail to reach the target group23600:11:18,604 --> 00:11:21,604you'll find that the  niche in which the disease23700:11:21,808 --> 00:11:24,833processes occur  within the population will continue to exist23800:11:25,033 --> 00:11:27,258because you have not addressed the population23900:11:27,445 --> 00:11:28,858that was affected.24000:11:29,057 --> 00:11:31,657So, that is another reason why implementation 24100:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,857failure could account for the reason why we don’t have  impact	24200:11:35,057 --> 00:11:38,669of the efficacious intervention within a broader population.24300:11:38,869 --> 00:11:42,219And then the last example is very common.24400:11:42,419 --> 00:11:46,357It’s this lack or failure to sustain an intervention.24500:11:46,557 --> 00:11:48,969Take for instance an24600:11:49,169 --> 00:11:52,169onchocerca volvulus prevention programme.24700:11:52,369 --> 00:11:55,019I mean, we have control programmes that have been made24800:11:55,219 --> 00:11:58,644to deliver ivermectin to endemic populations24900:11:58,819 --> 00:12:00,457that need the drug.25000:12:00,646 --> 00:12:02,596However, this is only a control.25100:12:02,791 --> 00:12:04,516When we fail to sustain the intervention25200:12:04,696 --> 00:12:07,271over a sufficient period of time what we'll find out is that25300:12:07,467 --> 00:12:10,254the disease that we are trying to curtail25400:12:10,454 --> 00:12:13,179would actually re-emerge and would resurge again.25500:12:13,342 --> 00:12:15,367And that would be an implementation failure.25600:12:15,549 --> 00:12:18,549So, lack of sustainability is also another reason why25700:12:18,749 --> 00:12:21,749we don't see impact of efficacious intervention25800:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,661within the population.25900:12:23,840 --> 00:12:27,622So, I've carefully outlined these six broad categories.26000:12:27,822 --> 00:12:31,797Because often times addressing these challenges or these issues26100:12:32,031 --> 00:12:36,018forms the major body of work in implementation research.26200:12:36,215 --> 00:12:39,922And testing strategies to address these issues or these challenges26300:12:40,122 --> 00:12:43,618forms the focus of implementation effectiveness research.26400:12:43,818 --> 00:12:48,040So, to summarize all that I've been saying: 26500:12:48,215 --> 00:12:50,352You cannot have impact26600:12:50,557 --> 00:12:53,557with only an efficacious intervention.26700:12:53,757 --> 00:12:56,757That is to say that having an efficacious26800:12:56,957 --> 00:13:00,520or an effective intervention is not sufficient26900:13:00,713 --> 00:13:03,135to generate impact within the population.27000:13:04,170 --> 00:13:05,919Interventions that are effective27100:13:06,119 --> 00:13:09,119and are efficacious must be backed up27200:13:09,319 --> 00:13:12,034 with effective implementation activities.27300:13:12,234 --> 00:13:14,959And it’s only when you have these two together27400:13:15,159 --> 00:13:19,239that you actually have impact at either the individual level27500:13:19,464 --> 00:13:22,551or the population level with regards to health.27600:13:22,751 --> 00:13:26,764Most research in Public Health has focused on generating evidence27700:13:26,954 --> 00:13:28,226for interventions.27800:13:28,403 --> 00:13:30,978And that’s why we have a lot of efficacious interventions27900:13:31,164 --> 00:13:32,726that are sitting on the shelf28000:13:32,938 --> 00:13:35,208and we are not seeing the impact that we hope to see28100:13:35,419 --> 00:13:36,776within the population.28200:13:36,976 --> 00:13:39,976And we've actually neglected focus on implementation.28300:13:40,176 --> 00:13:42,659And the whole essence of this module is to begin28400:13:42,834 --> 00:13:46,323to shift our thinking on how we think about  public health problems.28500:13:46,523 --> 00:13:49,165Thinking more in terms of implementation,28600:13:49,365 --> 00:13:52,365and implementation failure, and how to prescribe strategies28700:13:52,565 --> 00:13:55,565 to overcome  these and how to test these strategies28800:13:55,765 --> 00:14:00,693 in a form of research within  larger frameworks of public health research.28900:14:01,629 --> 00:14:04,554Here [if] we do have health outcomes29000:14:04,754 --> 00:14:08,929that are commonly used as outcomes of efficacy research29100:14:09,129 --> 00:14:11,079or effectiveness research.29200:14:11,290 --> 00:14:14,002For instance, for most clinical trials we use29300:14:14,219 --> 00:14:19,633an outcome like morbidity, mortality, clinical function29400:14:19,833 --> 00:14:23,620or symptomatology as [an] outcome of the success29500:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,629of our research.29600:14:25,817 --> 00:14:28,003And the same is true for effectiveness research.29700:14:28,203 --> 00:14:31,203So these are all health outcomes that are commonly used29800:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,850for testing or generating evidence for the efficacy29900:14:35,050 --> 00:14:37,901or the effectiveness of an intervention.30000:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,406So if we have distinguished implementation effectiveness30100:14:41,606 --> 00:14:44,606as a separate line of inquiry30200:14:44,806 --> 00:14:47,806from intervention efficacy, intervention effectiveness,30300:14:48,006 --> 00:14:51,006so what kind of outcomes can we use30400:14:51,206 --> 00:14:54,206to test implementation effectiveness30500:14:54,406 --> 00:14:57,688and not confuse it with intervention effectiveness30600:14:57,888 --> 00:14:59,523or intervention efficacy?30700:14:59,723 --> 00:15:03,030So that is to say that we can no longer use30800:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,555the same set of outcomes30900:15:05,755 --> 00:15:08,755that we call health outcomes, for implementation research.31000:15:09,906 --> 00:15:13,069So, they are [a] special kind of outcome that helps us to see31100:15:13,294 --> 00:15:15,569whether a set of implementation activities31200:15:15,756 --> 00:15:17,019works or not.31300:15:17,196 --> 00:15:19,804And they are distinct from health outcomes31400:15:20,004 --> 00:15:22,601like morbidity and mortality that helpus to see31500:15:22,801 --> 00:15:24,869whether an intervention works or not.31600:15:25,069 --> 00:15:28,069This set of outcomes that looks exclusively31700:15:28,269 --> 00:15:31,715at the success or the failure of implementation activities31800:15:31,915 --> 00:15:36,061are what we call implementation research outcomes.31900:15:36,261 --> 00:15:38,611Before we conclude this chapter32000:15:38,811 --> 00:15:42,202I would like to show you a framework on how to think about32100:15:42,402 --> 00:15:44,221implementation research.32200:15:44,421 --> 00:15:47,921Implementation research outcomes have been defined32300:15:48,121 --> 00:15:50,961as constructs that describe the effects32400:15:51,161 --> 00:15:53,674of a deliberate or purposive action32500:15:53,849 --> 00:15:55,794to implement an intervention.32600:15:55,994 --> 00:16:00,432That is to say this outcome defines exclusively the effect32700:16:00,632 --> 00:16:03,632of the set of implementation activities or strategy32800:16:03,832 --> 00:16:07,731as distinct from the effect of the intervention itself32900:16:07,931 --> 00:16:10,180within a larger programme setting.33000:16:11,090 --> 00:16:14,090And therefore they are useful for measuring success33100:16:14,290 --> 00:16:16,241or failure of implementation33200:16:16,441 --> 00:16:18,685or of implementation strategy.33300:16:18,885 --> 00:16:22,522Before we go on I'd like to show you an example of how to think about33400:16:22,710 --> 00:16:25,764implementation research in a way that we are able33500:16:25,964 --> 00:16:28,764to distinguish it from effectiveness research33600:16:28,939 --> 00:16:31,576of intervention, efficacy research33700:16:31,776 --> 00:16:34,776of intervention and implementation effectiveness.33800:16:34,976 --> 00:16:37,730So here we see a conceptual diagram33900:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,748for thinking about implementation research.34000:16:41,935 --> 00:16:44,458On my left side you see34100:16:44,658 --> 00:16:46,365interventions here.34200:16:46,565 --> 00:16:48,530These interventions are often the focus34300:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,288of most public health research.34400:16:50,488 --> 00:16:54,074And then on my right side you see the outcomes here,34500:16:54,274 --> 00:16:56,661which are health outcomes  that we observe34600:16:56,861 --> 00:16:59,216at the population level,  either at the individual level34700:16:59,416 --> 00:17:02,997or at the more aggregated level for the population.34800:17:03,197 --> 00:17:06,363And usually what research tries to do34900:17:06,563 --> 00:17:09,563is to link the intervention on my left side35000:17:09,763 --> 00:17:12,535<i[] with the outcomes on my right side.35100:17:12,735 --> 00:17:15,735And we often times miss what happens in-between.35200:17:16,704 --> 00:17:19,704So that's why even though we find out that the intervention35300:17:19,904 --> 00:17:23,490has worked based on changes on outcomes at a population level,35400:17:23,690 --> 00:17:26,301or changes on outcomes at the individual level,35500:17:26,501 --> 00:17:28,833[but] we find it very hard to replicate35600:17:29,033 --> 00:17:32,033those evidence-based interventions in other settings.35700:17:32,233 --> 00:17:35,233And this is where implementation research comes in.35800:17:35,433 --> 00:17:38,968So, this whole idea that you need some set of strategies35900:17:39,168 --> 00:17:42,523in trying to carry out or to deliver36000:17:42,723 --> 00:17:45,348an intervention within the population;36100:17:45,548 --> 00:17:48,610and that these strategies will interact with the intervention36200:17:48,810 --> 00:17:51,810to produce outcomes, implementation research outcomes36300:17:52,010 --> 00:17:55,622which will tell you whether the implementation activities36400:17:55,835 --> 00:17:57,435have been successful or not.36500:17:57,635 --> 00:18:01,272And is only when you have success in this set of activities36600:18:01,472 --> 00:18:03,519or you have success with the strategies36700:18:03,719 --> 00:18:06,827that you have improvement in service outcome36800:18:07,027 --> 00:18:09,827at an aggregate level, if it's applicable,36900:18:10,027 --> 00:18:13,027which oftentimes then leads on to the health outcomes37000:18:13,227 --> 00:18:15,110that we commonly see.37100:18:15,310 --> 00:18:18,310So here we are saying that the core of implementation science37200:18:18,510 --> 00:18:21,510is the description about implementation strategies37300:18:21,710 --> 00:18:24,460or thinking about how implementation strategies work37400:18:24,647 --> 00:18:26,599within a particular setting.37500:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,711And being able to articulate this effect37600:18:28,913 --> 00:18:31,512using measures of implementation research outcomes37700:18:31,712 --> 00:18:34,212and linking these Implementation Research Outcomes37800:18:34,412 --> 00:18:36,569to the health outcome that we hope to see37900:18:36,769 --> 00:18:39,297at the individual level or the population level.38000:18:39,497 --> 00:18:42,603This forms the core of implementation science38100:18:42,803 --> 00:18:45,803and forms most of the work or the body of work38200:18:46,003 --> 00:18:48,001that implementation research covers.38300:18:48,201 --> 00:18:51,362And indeed, implementation research outcome38400:18:51,562 --> 00:18:53,621is central to this knowledge.38500:18:53,821 --> 00:18:56,821because without the outcomes we are not able to distinguish38600:18:57,021 --> 00:18:59,494the effect of the implementation activities38700:18:59,694 --> 00:19:04,199from the intervention effectiveness or from the intervention efficacy.38800:19:04,399 --> 00:19:07,399So I hope this helps you to think about38900:19:07,599 --> 00:19:10,599implementation research, and also I hope it helps you39000:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,549to think about implementation research outcomes39100:19:13,749 --> 00:19:16,664and how central it is to the conduct39200:19:16,864 --> 00:19:18,498of implementation research.39300:19:18,698 --> 00:19:21,698To kind of recap all that we have been saying so far39400:19:21,898 --> 00:19:24,439let's go back to the quiz that you took at the beginning39500:19:24,627 --> 00:19:25,644of this chapter.39600:19:25,844 --> 00:19:30,010Remember, at the beginning of chapter 1 of this module39700:19:30,210 --> 00:19:32,790we asked you if implementation effectiveness39800:19:32,990 --> 00:19:35,648could be defined as the impact of an intervention39900:19:35,848 --> 00:19:37,749under a controlled setting.40000:19:37,949 --> 00:19:40,617By now I'm sure you will agree with me that that would be false.40100:19:40,817 --> 00:19:43,817Because looking at effect or generated evidence40200:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,336for an intervention under a controlled setting40300:19:46,516 --> 00:19:48,941is actually intervention efficacy.40400:19:49,141 --> 00:19:51,604And when you do that within a larger population group40500:19:51,804 --> 00:19:54,299that's intervention effectiveness.40600:19:54,499 --> 00:19:56,428But when you are trying to generate evidence40700:19:56,628 --> 00:19:59,628for the implementation activities as opposed to the intervention40800:19:59,828 --> 00:20:03,428then you are really in the domain of implementation effectiveness.40900:20:04,105 --> 00:20:07,330The second question had asked you if implementation research outcomes41000:20:07,530 --> 00:20:12,043are useful for assessing the impact of an intervention on individual41100:20:12,243 --> 00:20:14,132or population health.41200:20:14,332 --> 00:20:16,075Again, this would be false.41300:20:16,275 --> 00:20:20,309We know that health outcomes have been specifically described as useful41400:20:20,509 --> 00:20:23,528for measuring impact at individual health levels41500:20:23,728 --> 00:20:24,957or population health levels.41600:20:25,157 --> 00:20:27,051And we have said that these health outcomes41700:20:27,263 --> 00:20:30,188are used for measures of intervention efficacy41800:20:30,388 --> 00:20:32,426or intervention effectiveness.41900:20:32,626 --> 00:20:35,233Implementation research outcomes on the other hand42000:20:35,421 --> 00:20:39,310 look at success or failure of a set of implementation activities.42100:20:40,193 --> 00:20:45,061And these are actually more proximal to the implementation activities42200:20:45,293 --> 00:20:47,695as we saw from the diagram that was presented42300:20:47,895 --> 00:20:50,077on implementation research.42400:20:50,277 --> 00:20:53,277So, the third question was asking you exactly that:42500:20:53,477 --> 00:20:56,477if implementation research outcomes could be conceptualized42600:20:56,677 --> 00:20:59,677as the most proximal outcome of an implementation process.42700:20:59,877 --> 00:21:01,501And that is true.42800:21:01,701 --> 00:21:03,170Remember the diagram:42900:21:03,370 --> 00:21:05,511we have the evidence-based intervention,43000:21:05,711 --> 00:21:08,711we have the implementation strategy43100:21:08,911 --> 00:21:11,911and then the first set of outcomes that we see that tells us43200:21:12,111 --> 00:21:14,886how successful has the strategy worked43300:21:15,086 --> 00:21:17,039in a particular context with the list43400:21:17,214 --> 00:21:19,090of implementation research outcomes,43500:21:19,290 --> 00:21:21,532which may in turn mediate the service outcomes43600:21:21,732 --> 00:21:23,320and the population end outcomes43700:21:23,518 --> 00:21:26,608that we see at the end of the diagram.43800:21:26,808 --> 00:21:29,808And then the last question was asking yourself43900:21:30,008 --> 00:21:32,187if an effective intervention may not lead44000:21:32,387 --> 00:21:35,112 to a desired health outcome because of implementation failure.44100:21:35,325 --> 00:21:37,173And the right response again would be true.44200:21:37,373 --> 00:21:40,185We listed at least six broad categories44300:21:40,385 --> 00:21:42,494or reasons why implementation failure44400:21:42,694 --> 00:21:46,044might cause a lack of population health impact44500:21:46,244 --> 00:21:48,286for an efficacious intervention.44600:21:48,506 --> 00:21:52,185All of these are different reasons why interventions might fail44700:21:52,385 --> 00:21:54,929 to produce the impact that we hope to see.44800:21:55,129 --> 00:21:57,468I would say that this implementation failure44900:21:57,668 --> 00:22:00,668or prescribing strategies  [to address] this implementation failure45000:22:00,868 --> 00:22:03,868forms the focus of implementation research.45100:22:04,068 --> 00:22:07,318And testing these strategies actually forms what you are trying45200:22:07,518 --> 00:22:11,403to accomplish by doing studies on implementation effectiveness.
