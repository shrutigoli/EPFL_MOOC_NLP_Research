00:00:13,226in the Department of Health Behavior at Gillings School300:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,617of Global Public Health400:00:14,815 --> 00:00:17,352at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill.500:00:17,556 --> 00:00:19,605Today, we're going to talk about how to measure600:00:19,791 --> 00:00:22,030 implementation research outcomes.700:00:22,233 --> 00:00:25,120In chapter one, Dr. Alonge discussed the differences800:00:25,320 --> 00:00:28,670between innovation efficacy, innovation effectiveness900:00:28,856 --> 00:00:30,919and implementation effectiveness.1000:00:31,089 --> 00:00:34,338Then in chapter two, Dr. Alonge introduced six examples1100:00:34,531 --> 00:00:39,157of field studies conducted in Africa on infectious diseases of poverty,1200:00:39,337 --> 00:00:41,499and the implementation research outcomes1300:00:41,683 --> 00:00:44,121that each of these studies utilized.1400:00:44,329 --> 00:00:47,004In chapter three, I'll be talking about how to measure1500:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,312implementation research outcomes using these same six examples.1600:00:51,518 --> 00:00:55,493This chapter specifically will to be divided to two sections.1700:00:56,539 --> 00:00:59,275In section one, we will discuss examples1800:00:59,473 --> 00:01:02,498of how implementation research outcomes have been defined1900:01:02,685 --> 00:01:05,547and operationalized  in implementation research2000:01:05,730 --> 00:01:08,604focused on infectious diseases of poverty in the field.2100:01:09,263 --> 00:01:12,350In section two, we will describe data sources.2200:01:12,558 --> 00:01:14,996In other words, from whom we will collect data from2300:01:15,182 --> 00:01:17,005and data collection approaches.2400:01:17,214 --> 00:01:19,876In other words, what methods we will use to collect data2500:01:20,104 --> 00:01:22,967to support implementation research outcomes.2600:01:23,147 --> 00:01:25,999Let's start by taking a little quiz to gauge your awareness2700:01:26,199 --> 00:01:27,048of these issues.2800:01:27,235 --> 00:01:29,598This is just for you to get a sense of what you know2900:01:29,774 --> 00:01:32,362and what you don't know but can learn from this chapter.3000:01:32,573 --> 00:01:34,510I'm going to read four statements.3100:01:34,716 --> 00:01:37,541Please take a moment to write one to four on a piece of paper.3200:01:37,739 --> 00:01:40,939After each statement I read, mark if you think the statement3300:01:41,151 --> 00:01:44,464is true or false on the paper, next to the statement number.3400:01:44,648 --> 00:01:47,374At the end of chapter three, I'll revisit the statements3500:01:47,587 --> 00:01:50,874and go over why each of them is either true or false.3600:01:51,830 --> 00:01:54,529Statement number one, true or false.3700:01:54,745 --> 00:01:57,370Data for measuring implementation research outcomes3800:01:57,567 --> 00:02:01,731are often collected across multiple socioecological levels.3900:02:01,929 --> 00:02:05,191By socio-ecological levels, I mean individual levels,4000:02:05,402 --> 00:02:08,053community level, organizational level, etc.4100:02:09,470 --> 00:02:11,858Statement number two, true or false.4200:02:12,075 --> 00:02:14,313Data on implementation research outcomes4300:02:14,529 --> 00:02:16,429can be collected using both qualitative4400:02:16,614 --> 00:02:18,651 and quantitative methods.4500:02:19,790 --> 00:02:23,165Statement number three, true or false.4600:02:23,344 --> 00:02:26,257Administrative data are useful sources of information4700:02:26,450 --> 00:02:28,938for measuring implementation research outcomes4800:02:29,123 --> 00:02:30,810such as cost and fidelity.4900:02:31,014 --> 00:02:34,301By administrative data, we mean data that is already being collected5000:02:34,503 --> 00:02:36,604by the organization or programme.5100:02:37,549 --> 00:02:40,848Statement number four, true or false.5200:02:41,052 --> 00:02:43,589Measurement of implementation research can often5300:02:43,784 --> 00:02:45,435involve scale development.5400:02:46,155 --> 00:02:48,868You can set aside your paper now and we'll go back5500:02:49,037 --> 00:02:51,561and revisit these statements and the correct answers5600:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,150at the end of this chapter.5700:02:53,343 --> 00:02:55,342In the meantime, let's go over these concepts5800:02:55,555 --> 00:02:57,194in the next two sessions.5900:02:57,439 --> 00:03:00,764Let's go back now to the six studies that Dr. Alonge presented6000:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,267in chapter two of this module.6100:03:03,470 --> 00:03:06,470I'm going to use these six studies as examples of how6200:03:06,690 --> 00:03:09,578 implementation research outcomes have been defined6300:03:09,762 --> 00:03:12,949for a specific disease in a specific context.6400:03:13,167 --> 00:03:16,142First, let's look at the example of the study entitled6500:03:16,355 --> 00:03:18,842Community directed intervention strategies6600:03:19,025 --> 00:03:22,401for the control of onchocerciasis with ivermectin.6700:03:22,608 --> 00:03:25,770As we mentioned in module 2, the goal of the study6800:03:25,965 --> 00:03:29,390was to assess if a community directed intervention approach6900:03:29,627 --> 00:03:35,190improved treatment coverage in onchocerciasis affected communities.7000:03:35,853 --> 00:03:38,502The implementation research outcomes in the study7100:03:38,714 --> 00:03:41,127were coverage and cost.7200:03:41,945 --> 00:03:44,395Coverage was defined as the number of persons7300:03:44,612 --> 00:03:47,724treated with ivermectin for total population7400:03:47,906 --> 00:03:51,706within a community health worker's kinship zone in one year.7500:03:51,910 --> 00:03:54,710In other words, the total number of people treated7600:03:54,902 --> 00:03:57,164among those who should have received it.7700:03:57,911 --> 00:04:00,949Cost was defined as cost of training7800:04:01,118 --> 00:04:03,355which included allowances for the trainers,7900:04:03,541 --> 00:04:06,679transport and food for trainees and training materials8000:04:06,878 --> 00:04:09,890divided by the total number of community health workers8100:04:10,098 --> 00:04:13,036and supervisors that were trained in one year.8200:04:13,821 --> 00:04:17,684In the study by Akogun and colleagues in Nigeria,8300:04:17,895 --> 00:04:20,795among nomadic Fulani communities to manage malaria,8400:04:20,998 --> 00:04:23,048the implementation research outcomes8500:04:23,247 --> 00:04:25,473were coverage and acceptability.8600:04:25,695 --> 00:04:28,395As we mentioned in module two, the goal of this study8700:04:28,574 --> 00:04:31,474was to improve uptake of insecticide treated nets8800:04:31,682 --> 00:04:35,932and prompt treatment of malaria among children who are under 5.8900:04:36,146 --> 00:04:39,909Coverage in the study was defined as the proportion of children under 59000:04:40,116 --> 00:04:43,079with a fever who received antimalarial treatment9100:04:43,301 --> 00:04:45,964as well as the proportion of individuals9200:04:46,163 --> 00:04:50,351under insecticide treated nets per two nomadic cycles9300:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,535within a pre-defined nomadic group.9400:04:53,144 --> 00:04:57,256Acceptability in this study was defined as general satisfaction9500:04:57,469 --> 00:05:00,094with community directed intervention strategy9600:05:00,301 --> 00:05:03,001and the two evidence based interventions consisting9700:05:03,218 --> 00:05:06,293of treated nets and malarial treatment,9800:05:06,488 --> 00:05:09,576as well as the demand for evidence based interventions9900:05:09,754 --> 00:05:11,254in the community.10000:05:11,462 --> 00:05:15,199In the study conducted by Akweongo, Artemisinin-based Combined10100:05:15,411 --> 00:05:18,936Combination Therapy distributed to a community based distributor10200:05:19,158 --> 00:05:22,558in rural areas in Ghana, Burkina Faso10300:05:22,769 --> 00:05:25,568Ethiopia, and Malawi was evaluated.10400:05:25,755 --> 00:05:28,805Specifically, community medicine distributors (CMDs) were trained10500:05:28,993 --> 00:05:32,768to educate care givers, diagnose and treat malaria cases10600:05:32,969 --> 00:05:35,556in under fiveyear-old children.10700:05:35,761 --> 00:05:38,923The implementation outcomes of the study were fidelity,10800:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,473coverage and feasibility.10900:05:41,673 --> 00:05:44,361Fidelity here was defined as services delivered11000:05:44,558 --> 00:05:48,007by community medicine distributors as planned, which was measured11100:05:48,217 --> 00:05:51,355as the proportion of febrile illnesses that was treated11200:05:51,555 --> 00:05:54,418with Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy,11300:05:54,604 --> 00:05:57,979promptness of treatment and correct dosage and duration.11400:05:58,565 --> 00:06:01,940Coverage was defined as the proportion of children who are under five11500:06:02,114 --> 00:06:04,639presented to the community medicine distributors11600:06:04,854 --> 00:06:09,017that were treated within 24 hours of onset in the two weeks11700:06:09,235 --> 00:06:12,197prior to the survey in a predefined area.11800:06:12,437 --> 00:06:16,324Feasibility was operationalized as a community medicine distributor’s11900:06:16,515 --> 00:06:20,727self-purported ability to recognize and promptly treat malaria cases12000:06:20,969 --> 00:06:24,019and care givers’ acceptability of these services12100:06:24,215 --> 00:06:26,777provided by the community medicine distributors.12200:06:27,356 --> 00:06:31,081In the study conducted by Okeibunor and colleagues in Nigeria,12300:06:31,294 --> 00:06:33,269Togo and Cameroon,12400:06:33,469 --> 00:06:37,356researchers studied the involvement of community directed distributors (CDDs)12500:06:37,566 --> 00:06:40,453of ivermectin for onchocerciasis control12600:06:40,658 --> 00:06:42,545and other health related activities.12700:06:42,763 --> 00:06:45,950Specifically the researchers addressed or assessed12800:06:46,143 --> 00:06:49,330if involvement in additional activities such as EPI,12900:06:49,524 --> 00:06:50,974water and sanitation13000:06:51,143 --> 00:06:54,555in community development projects detracted from their effectiveness13100:06:54,732 --> 00:06:56,745in delivering ivermectin.13200:06:56,961 --> 00:06:59,674Feasibility and coverage were measured as the two13300:06:59,895 --> 00:07:01,945primary implementation outcomes.13400:07:02,393 --> 00:07:06,131Feasibility was measured as attitude and performance of CDDs13500:07:06,339 --> 00:07:08,801involved in other public health activities.13600:07:09,001 --> 00:07:11,700In this case, performance was measured as coverage rate13700:07:11,886 --> 00:07:13,437 for ivermectin treatment.13800:07:13,641 --> 00:07:16,728Coverage was measured as the proportion of the population who13900:07:16,944 --> 00:07:20,232received ivermectin treatment in the communities from which14000:07:20,418 --> 00:07:23,443the community directed distributors were selected.14100:07:24,267 --> 00:07:26,754In the study, Early treatment of childhood fevers14200:07:26,927 --> 00:07:29,639with pre-packaged antimalarial drugs in the home,14300:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,968Sirima and colleagues evaluated the impact of using pre-packaged14400:07:34,177 --> 00:07:36,889antimalarial drugs by mothers at home14500:07:37,076 --> 00:07:40,938and the progression of disease in children from uncomplicated fevers14600:07:41,146 --> 00:07:42,921to severe malaria.14700:07:43,389 --> 00:07:46,202Fidelity was the only implementation outcome assessed14800:07:46,426 --> 00:07:49,364and it was operationalized specifically by looking14900:07:49,594 --> 00:07:52,757at the proportion of children, six years and under15000:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,035who had uncomplicated malaria that was treated as planned.15100:07:57,235 --> 00:08:01,022“Treated as planned” here was defined as being promptly treated15200:08:01,219 --> 00:08:05,556with pre-packaged antimalarial drugs with correct age-specific dose15300:08:05,774 --> 00:08:10,111and duration in the four weeks prior to the assessment survey.15400:08:10,337 --> 00:08:14,075In the last example, Akogun and colleagues assessed strategies15500:08:14,275 --> 00:08:17,562for community directed treatment of onchocerciasis15600:08:17,777 --> 00:08:20,315with ivermectin in Nigeria.15700:08:21,170 --> 00:08:26,295The study evaluated fidelity, coverage, cost and feasibility15800:08:26,515 --> 00:08:28,990as its implementation research outcomes.15900:08:29,215 --> 00:08:32,664Fidelity in this study was measured as appropriate adherence16000:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,220to the treatment regimen, correct dosage16100:08:35,446 --> 00:08:38,534and treatment frequency, and the correct management16200:08:38,737 --> 00:08:41,124of adverse reactions to medication.16300:08:41,736 --> 00:08:44,999Coverage was measured as the total number of people treated16400:08:45,201 --> 00:08:48,851out of the total population after two cycles of treatment.16500:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,762Feasibility was operationalized as the acceptability of a range16600:08:52,961 --> 00:08:55,598of community directed ivermectin approaches16700:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,835and the cost and coverage under different approaches.16800:08:59,062 --> 00:09:02,963And finally, cost was measured as all costs16900:09:03,167 --> 00:09:06,605that the village spent in delivering ivermectin.17000:09:06,785 --> 00:09:09,185You'll notice that although there are similarities17100:09:09,402 --> 00:09:12,790in diseases such as malaria and onchocerciasis,17200:09:13,028 --> 00:09:17,040in these examples, that both selection of implementation outcomes17300:09:17,233 --> 00:09:19,895and the way that they were operationalized17400:09:20,084 --> 00:09:23,534were tailored to the specific goals and contexts of the interventions17500:09:23,722 --> 00:09:25,073and the studies.17600:09:25,265 --> 00:09:28,602So, for example, in the study conducted by Akogun and colleagues17700:09:28,818 --> 00:09:33,231in Nigeria among nomadic Fulani communities to manage malaria,17800:09:33,436 --> 00:09:37,836the implementation research outcomes were coverage and acceptability.17900:09:38,401 --> 00:09:41,438As you may remember the goal in the study was to improve18000:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,310the uptake of insecticide-treated nets18100:09:44,493 --> 00:09:47,743and prompt treatment of malaria among children under five.18200:09:48,483 --> 00:09:51,734In the study conducted by Akweongo, Artemisinin-based18300:09:51,932 --> 00:09:53,132Combination Therapy18400:09:53,309 --> 00:09:56,234distributed to a community medicine distributor18500:09:56,461 --> 00:10:01,811in rural areas in Ghana, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia,18600:10:02,024 --> 00:10:04,049and Malawi was evaluated.18700:10:04,238 --> 00:10:08,174The implementation outcomes of this study were fidelity,18800:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,242coverage and feasibility.18900:10:10,439 --> 00:10:12,151So you can see there were differences19000:10:12,378 --> 00:10:15,991in implementation outcomes selected based on the goals19100:10:16,203 --> 00:10:18,177of the intervention, and although19200:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,654both studies looked at coverage as an outcome,19300:10:20,845 --> 00:10:23,833the operationalization was a little different.19400:10:24,027 --> 00:10:27,778Coverage in the study by Akogun and colleagues was defined19500:10:27,949 --> 00:10:31,425as the proportion of children under five with a fever19600:10:31,643 --> 00:10:34,855who received antimalarial treatment19700:10:35,049 --> 00:10:37,563as well as the proportion of individuals19800:10:37,737 --> 00:10:42,000under insecticide treated nets per two nomadic movement cycles19900:10:42,204 --> 00:10:44,504within a predefined nomadic group.20000:10:44,681 --> 00:10:48,105Coverage in the Akweongo study was defined as the proportion20100:10:48,313 --> 00:10:50,376of children who are under five who presented20200:10:50,572 --> 00:10:53,848to the community medicine distributors20300:10:54,046 --> 00:10:57,771that were treated within 24 hours of onset in the two weeks prior20400:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,380to the survey in a predefined area.20500:11:00,556 --> 00:11:02,469So you see that there are similarities20600:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,879in the operational definitions of coverage,20700:11:05,095 --> 00:11:09,009so both consider appropriate malarial treatment20800:11:09,203 --> 00:11:11,716for children under five, but one denominator20900:11:11,911 --> 00:11:15,362is all children with the fever whereas in other denominator,21000:11:15,574 --> 00:11:19,449it's just among those who presented to a community medicine distributor.21100:11:19,646 --> 00:11:22,734And one also considers insecticide-treated nets.21200:11:22,952 --> 00:11:26,051These are due to the differences in the evidence-based interventions21300:11:26,244 --> 00:11:28,795being tested or being scaled up.21400:11:28,981 --> 00:11:30,944In addition,  the time frames are different.21500:11:31,136 --> 00:11:34,037One considers it per nomadic movement cycles21600:11:34,241 --> 00:11:37,416while the other considers it within two weeks prior to the survey,21700:11:37,611 --> 00:11:40,261reflecting the different populations under study.21800:11:40,475 --> 00:11:42,900That is why we say, implementation research outcomes21900:11:43,087 --> 00:11:44,901are heuristically defined.22000:11:45,108 --> 00:11:48,419Now that we've talked about how different implementation outcomes22100:11:48,611 --> 00:11:51,649can be operationalized in the field, we're going to talk about22200:11:51,845 --> 00:11:55,870how data on implementation research outcomes are collected.22300:11:56,817 --> 00:12:00,505Implementation research outcomes can be collected at different levels22400:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,357and through different data collection approaches.22500:12:03,542 --> 00:12:06,180I want to emphasize that implementation studies22600:12:06,379 --> 00:12:11,430typically use mixed quantitative-qualitative designs, identifying factors22700:12:11,646 --> 00:12:14,433that impact uptake across multiple levels22800:12:14,653 --> 00:12:18,441including patient, provider, clinic, facility,22900:12:18,671 --> 00:12:21,321organization and often the broader community23000:12:21,557 --> 00:12:23,181and policy environments.23100:12:23,355 --> 00:12:26,418Accordingly, implementation science requires the involvement23200:12:26,623 --> 00:12:30,260of trans-disciplinary research teams as we had mentioned in module 123300:12:30,471 --> 00:12:31,845of this course.23400:12:32,042 --> 00:12:36,055Common quanitative measures include structured surveys23500:12:36,277 --> 00:12:38,739that assess for example organizational context,23600:12:38,936 --> 00:12:42,736provider attitudes and behaviors, patient receptivity to change23700:12:42,955 --> 00:12:46,044or household access to provider services.23800:12:46,248 --> 00:12:49,197Administrative data are often utilized either23900:12:49,412 --> 00:12:52,638in focal target populations or at the broader system levels24000:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,714to characterize for example, baseline24100:12:54,878 --> 00:12:59,641and change in rates of utilization of particular practices.24200:12:59,824 --> 00:13:03,425Common qualitative data collection methods include semi-structured24300:13:03,627 --> 00:13:07,914interviews with patients, providers or other stakeholders,24400:13:08,111 --> 00:13:09,536focus groups,24500:13:09,734 --> 00:13:14,546direct observation of clinical processes and document review.24600:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,813One final note, implementation research outcomes24700:13:18,009 --> 00:13:20,021are by nature, latent variables.24800:13:20,225 --> 00:13:24,001That is to say that these variables are often not directly observable24900:13:24,204 --> 00:13:26,829but rather, are rather inferred from other variables25000:13:27,052 --> 00:13:30,215that are observed, and may require scale development.25100:13:30,417 --> 00:13:33,267For example you can not directly observe acceptability25200:13:33,473 --> 00:13:36,223but rather can combine a series of questions that together25300:13:36,446 --> 00:13:38,384infer acceptability.25400:13:39,213 --> 00:13:42,801Let's look now at each of the nine implementation research outcomes25500:13:43,018 --> 00:13:44,982that we have presented in this chapter.25600:13:45,195 --> 00:13:49,321Acceptability can be measured at the individual or community level25700:13:49,557 --> 00:13:52,882through quantitative surveys that assess satisfaction.25800:13:53,103 --> 00:13:56,090It can also be measured through qualitative interviews25900:13:56,293 --> 00:13:59,093including in-depth interviews or focus groups that explore26000:13:59,300 --> 00:14:02,600participants’ satisfaction with a particular intervention.26100:14:03,224 --> 00:14:06,324And finally, acceptability can be measured through26200:14:06,525 --> 00:14:08,674administrative data that collects data26300:14:08,853 --> 00:14:11,078on service utilization overtime.26400:14:11,855 --> 00:14:15,092Adoption can be measured at the individual, community26500:14:15,298 --> 00:14:17,661or organization level since the intention26600:14:17,846 --> 00:14:22,059to try a new intervention can be an individual,  community,26700:14:22,289 --> 00:14:25,152and/or organizational level decision.26800:14:25,362 --> 00:14:28,737For example, the decision to integrate mental health services26900:14:28,933 --> 00:14:31,371at a primary healthcare system can be made27000:14:31,559 --> 00:14:34,647at the organizational level by clinic leadership27100:14:34,848 --> 00:14:38,011but the decision to utilize these services may be made27200:14:38,219 --> 00:14:40,994at an individual and/or community level.27300:14:41,872 --> 00:14:44,722Adoption can be seen through observation27400:14:44,919 --> 00:14:48,094through a survey, or through other qualitative data27500:14:48,294 --> 00:14:51,331such as in-depth interviews or focus groups27600:14:52,095 --> 00:14:55,258and through administrative data, for example, you can examine27700:14:55,494 --> 00:14:58,270clinical records to check if primary care physicians27800:14:58,464 --> 00:15:01,276are appropriately screening for and referring27900:15:01,444 --> 00:15:03,720to mental health services.28000:15:04,682 --> 00:15:08,432Appropriateness or fit of the evidence based programme28100:15:08,659 --> 00:15:11,659or implementation strategy can also be measured28200:15:11,871 --> 00:15:15,608through individual, community or organizational level28300:15:16,304 --> 00:15:20,030through either surveys or qualitative methods.28400:15:20,762 --> 00:15:24,488And feasibility, the extent to which an intervention can be carried out28500:15:24,711 --> 00:15:27,147in a specific setting or organization28600:15:27,347 --> 00:15:29,185can be measured at the individual,28700:15:29,386 --> 00:15:32,648community or organizational levels through surveys,28800:15:32,876 --> 00:15:35,775administrative data and qualitative methods.28900:15:35,978 --> 00:15:39,467Continuing on to the last four implementation outcomes;29000:15:39,658 --> 00:15:42,708fidelity, the degree to which an intervention was implemented29100:15:42,909 --> 00:15:46,234as planned, can be measured at the individual level29200:15:46,445 --> 00:15:50,608through survey, observation, checklists,29300:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,504self-report and administrative data.29400:15:54,005 --> 00:15:58,030For example, if assessing the fidelity of a counseling session29500:15:58,249 --> 00:15:59,622as an intervention,29600:15:59,811 --> 00:16:02,460an independent observer could sit in on the session29700:16:02,674 --> 00:16:05,012and complete a checklist to ensure that the session29800:16:05,229 --> 00:16:07,242was delivered as planned.29900:16:08,352 --> 00:16:11,039Implementation cost can be measured30000:16:11,272 --> 00:16:13,422by the individual or organization level30100:16:13,609 --> 00:16:16,283by assessing cost data that's already being collected30200:16:16,453 --> 00:16:18,653by the clinic or organization.30300:16:19,337 --> 00:16:23,038Penetration, the extent to which a population eligible30400:16:23,243 --> 00:16:26,719to receive an intervention, actually receives that intervention30500:16:26,918 --> 00:16:30,556can be measured at the individual, community or organization level30600:16:30,743 --> 00:16:35,255also, through surveys, checklists and, or an audit30700:16:35,438 --> 00:16:37,375by an independent observer.30800:16:38,056 --> 00:16:41,294And finally, sustainability, which is defined as the extent30900:16:41,537 --> 00:16:43,761to which an intervention is maintained31000:16:43,968 --> 00:16:45,580in a given setting or context31100:16:45,767 --> 00:16:49,417can be measured at the individual, community or organizational level31200:16:49,620 --> 00:16:53,534using surveys, administrative data and qualitative methods31300:16:53,722 --> 00:16:54,972including an audit.31400:16:55,818 --> 00:16:58,605Let's now turn back to our six examples of studies31500:16:58,795 --> 00:17:01,259of infectious diseases of poverty in the field.31600:17:01,459 --> 00:17:04,785We can see how implementation research outcomes are measured,31700:17:05,003 --> 00:17:08,904both in terms of the multiple levels from which we draw our data from31800:17:09,154 --> 00:17:12,367and the different methods used to collect these data.31900:17:13,453 --> 00:17:15,827In Uganda and Cameroon, as you may remember,32000:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,925Katabarwa and colleagues defined coverage as the total number32100:17:20,136 --> 00:17:22,786of people treated with ivermectin32200:17:22,991 --> 00:17:25,966among those who should have received it.32300:17:26,180 --> 00:17:29,192They used both individual and community level data32400:17:29,389 --> 00:17:31,813through community household treatment records32500:17:31,999 --> 00:17:34,687that were completed by the community health workers.32600:17:34,879 --> 00:17:37,943In the study, data on cost, which was defined32700:17:38,137 --> 00:17:41,287as the cost of training including allowances for the trainers,32800:17:41,487 --> 00:17:45,024transport and food for the trainees and the training materials32900:17:45,234 --> 00:17:47,447was collected at the organizational level33000:17:47,670 --> 00:17:51,121through the administrative system that already tracked these costs.33100:17:52,019 --> 00:17:54,994In Nigeria, among nomadic Fulani communities33200:17:55,177 --> 00:17:58,291who are managing malaria, coverage defined33300:17:58,519 --> 00:18:01,894as you may remember, as the proportion of children under five33400:18:02,115 --> 00:18:04,539who received antimalarial treatment33500:18:04,715 --> 00:18:08,091and the proportion of individuals under insecticide treated nets33600:18:08,293 --> 00:18:11,705which measured at both the household and community level33700:18:11,931 --> 00:18:13,607through household surveys.33800:18:13,834 --> 00:18:16,583Acceptability which was defined in the study33900:18:16,767 --> 00:18:19,580as general satisfaction with the community directed34000:18:19,797 --> 00:18:23,971intervention strategy and the two evidence based interventions34100:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,591consisting of treated nets and malaria treatment34200:18:27,794 --> 00:18:30,819as well as the demand for the evidence based interventions34300:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,100in the community,34400:18:32,329 --> 00:18:35,067 was assessed through qualitative in-depth interviews34500:18:35,268 --> 00:18:37,830and focus groups at the individual level34600:18:38,035 --> 00:18:41,386and feedback meetings at the community level.34700:18:41,829 --> 00:18:45,953These two studies are good examples of how one implementation outcome34800:18:46,136 --> 00:18:48,186can be measured at multiple levels.34900:18:48,422 --> 00:18:51,985You can see in the study by Akogun how if we want to get35000:18:52,217 --> 00:18:54,542community level perceptions of acceptability,35100:18:54,744 --> 00:18:58,620a different data collection approach in the form of community meetings35200:18:58,833 --> 00:19:00,995is used compared to the individual level35300:19:01,194 --> 00:19:04,182acceptability data collection methods.35400:19:04,617 --> 00:19:08,067In our third example, [in] the study by Akweongo and colleagues35500:19:08,274 --> 00:19:11,062as we remember, aimed to assess the impact35600:19:11,269 --> 00:19:15,832of community medicine distributors trained to diagnose35700:19:16,028 --> 00:19:19,779and treat malaria cases in children under five years of age35800:19:19,967 --> 00:19:21,479using ACT.35900:19:21,667 --> 00:19:24,505Fidelity was defined as treatment as planned36000:19:24,734 --> 00:19:27,059delivered by community medicine distributors,[and]36100:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,440was measured both at the individual36200:19:29,658 --> 00:19:32,934and organization levels using the records completed36300:19:33,144 --> 00:19:35,506by the community medicine distributors.36400:19:35,710 --> 00:19:38,585Coverage defined in the study as a proportion of children36500:19:38,803 --> 00:19:42,278under five who presented to community medicine distributors36600:19:42,520 --> 00:19:45,470that were treated within 24 hours  of onset,36700:19:45,701 --> 00:19:49,114was measured at the household and the community level36800:19:49,320 --> 00:19:51,695through a household survey36900:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,525completed by clients.37000:19:53,726 --> 00:19:57,301Feasibility defined here as the CMDs ability37100:19:57,524 --> 00:20:01,062to recognize and promptly treat malaria cases37200:20:01,284 --> 00:20:04,120and the care giver's satisfaction of these services37300:20:04,347 --> 00:20:07,085was collected at the individual and community level37400:20:07,282 --> 00:20:10,194using qualitative interviews with care givers.37500:20:10,768 --> 00:20:13,830In our fourth example, Okeibunor and colleagues37600:20:14,047 --> 00:20:17,836assessed whether community directed distributors' additional activities37700:20:18,017 --> 00:20:22,405had a negative or positive effect on the distribution of ivermectin37800:20:22,589 --> 00:20:24,589to treat onchocerciasis.37900:20:24,794 --> 00:20:29,432Feasibility operationalized here as attitude and performance of CDDs38000:20:29,624 --> 00:20:31,749involved in other public health activities38100:20:31,972 --> 00:20:34,947was measured at the individual or CDD level38200:20:35,159 --> 00:20:36,859through health worker survey.38300:20:37,066 --> 00:20:40,517At the household level, through household surveys,38400:20:40,717 --> 00:20:43,653and at the community level through focused group discussions38500:20:43,852 --> 00:20:46,378and in-depth interviews with care givers.38600:20:47,253 --> 00:20:50,341Coverage defined as the proportion of the population38700:20:50,561 --> 00:20:54,211who received Ivermectin treatment in the communities from which38800:20:54,438 --> 00:20:58,863the community directed distributors were selected was measured38900:20:59,087 --> 00:21:02,011at the household level through household surveys.39000:21:02,807 --> 00:21:05,443Moving on to our last two examples.39100:21:05,645 --> 00:21:09,283As you recall, Sirima and colleagues evaluated the impact39200:21:09,482 --> 00:21:11,857using pre-packaged antimalarial drugs39300:21:12,057 --> 00:21:15,557by mothers at home, on the progression of diseases in children39400:21:15,762 --> 00:21:18,949from uncomplicated fever to severe malaria.39500:21:19,132 --> 00:21:22,044Fidelity was the only implementation outcome assessed39600:21:22,266 --> 00:21:23,842and it was operationalized39700:21:24,035 --> 00:21:26,210by looking at the proportion of children39800:21:26,444 --> 00:21:29,317six years and under who had uncomplicated malaria39900:21:29,528 --> 00:21:31,279that was treated as planned.40000:21:31,463 --> 00:21:33,975Fidelity was measured at the household level40100:21:34,165 --> 00:21:35,966through a household survey.40200:21:36,146 --> 00:21:37,584And finally,40300:21:37,769 --> 00:21:40,680Akogun and colleagues assessed a range of strategies40400:21:40,885 --> 00:21:43,848for community directed treatment of onchocerciasis40500:21:44,043 --> 00:21:46,119with ivermectin in Nigeria.40600:21:46,695 --> 00:21:49,795Fidelity measured here as the appropriate adherence40700:21:50,010 --> 00:21:53,373to the treatment regimen, correct dosage and frequency40800:21:53,577 --> 00:21:57,528and the correct management of adverse reactions to medication40900:21:57,711 --> 00:22:00,398was measured at the individual and household levels41000:22:00,600 --> 00:22:02,239through a household survey.41100:22:02,949 --> 00:22:05,799Coverage defined in the study41200:22:06,022 --> 00:22:10,410as the total number of people treated out of the total population41300:22:10,585 --> 00:22:13,135after two cycles of treatment was also measured at41400:22:13,338 --> 00:22:16,737the individual and household level using a household survey.41500:22:17,364 --> 00:22:21,503Feasibility operationally defined in this study as acceptability41600:22:21,710 --> 00:22:25,372of a range of community directed ivermectin approaches41700:22:25,573 --> 00:22:28,273and the cost in coverage under different approaches41800:22:28,497 --> 00:22:31,523was assessed at both the individual and household levels41900:22:31,710 --> 00:22:34,647through the household survey and at the community level42000:22:34,828 --> 00:22:39,067using direct observations and in depth interviews with clients.42100:22:39,629 --> 00:22:42,554And finally, cost, operationally defined42200:22:42,762 --> 00:22:44,950as all costs that the villages spend42300:22:45,193 --> 00:22:49,081in delivering ivermectin was obtained at the community level42400:22:49,282 --> 00:22:51,669through a structured form that cataloged42500:22:51,876 --> 00:22:53,776all inputs from the village.42600:22:54,002 --> 00:22:56,815We can see from these examples that the levels from which42700:22:57,000 --> 00:23:00,112we obtain data, and the methods used for data collection42800:23:00,323 --> 00:23:04,922stands from a combination of how we operationalized42900:23:05,121 --> 00:23:08,495 the implementation outcomes and what is realistically feasible43000:23:08,735 --> 00:23:11,947given time and resource constraints.43100:23:12,141 --> 00:23:15,542So, we've learned in chapter three how we operationalize43200:23:15,728 --> 00:23:18,728implementation research outcomes and how we collect data43300:23:18,903 --> 00:23:22,252on these outcomes, both in terms of sources and methods43400:23:22,461 --> 00:23:26,299using our six examples drawn from our required readings.43500:23:26,515 --> 00:23:29,079Let's now revisit the statements that we used to gauge43600:23:29,313 --> 00:23:31,352our knowledge about implementation outcomes43700:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,609at the beginning of this chapter.43800:23:34,553 --> 00:23:37,640The first statement was: data for measuring43900:23:37,819 --> 00:23:40,593implementation research outcomes are often collected44000:23:40,802 --> 00:23:43,565across multiple socio-ecological levels.44100:23:44,395 --> 00:23:46,946The correct response here is true.44200:23:47,128 --> 00:23:49,390We know the data come from multiple levels44300:23:49,621 --> 00:23:53,107including patients, provider, clinic, facility44400:23:53,301 --> 00:23:56,065and organizational levels44500:23:56,705 --> 00:23:59,980to give us a fuller picture of the implementation effectiveness44600:24:00,215 --> 00:24:02,102for multiple perspectives.44700:24:03,886 --> 00:24:05,624The second statement:44800:24:05,844 --> 00:24:08,682implementation research outcome data can be collected using44900:24:08,877 --> 00:24:11,690both quantitative and qualitative methods.45000:24:11,864 --> 00:24:14,738The correct response is true.45100:24:14,938 --> 00:24:18,963We know that in order to glean a fuller picture of barriers45200:24:19,156 --> 00:24:22,043to implementation and implementation effectiveness,45300:24:22,250 --> 00:24:24,676it's necessary to use both quantitative45400:24:24,871 --> 00:24:26,496and qualitative methods45500:24:26,685 --> 00:24:30,373to understand the extent of barriers and effectiveness45600:24:30,556 --> 00:24:33,307and the hows and the whys behind those barriers45700:24:33,516 --> 00:24:37,042and to triangulate information from both sources45800:24:37,260 --> 00:24:39,072and all methods.45900:24:40,921 --> 00:24:45,134Three, administrative data are useful sources of information46000:24:45,339 --> 00:24:47,964for measuring implementation research outcomes46100:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,223such as cost and fidelity.46200:24:51,749 --> 00:24:54,686The correct response here is true.46300:24:54,899 --> 00:24:57,286To save resources and to avoid duplication,46400:24:57,492 --> 00:25:01,330we can use already existing data that are being collected by clinics,46500:25:01,527 --> 00:25:03,690programmes and organizations to assess46600:25:03,893 --> 00:25:07,893implementation outcomes such as cost and fidelity.46700:25:09,808 --> 00:25:10,945Four.46800:25:11,978 --> 00:25:14,940Measurement of implementation research outcomes often46900:25:15,165 --> 00:25:16,829involves scale development.47000:25:17,597 --> 00:25:20,885The correct response to this statement is true.47100:25:21,053 --> 00:25:23,491We know that often implementation outcomes47200:25:23,707 --> 00:25:25,532are by nature, latent variables.47300:25:25,705 --> 00:25:29,356That is to say, that these variables are not directly observable,47400:25:29,543 --> 00:25:33,056but can rather be inferred from other variables that are observed.47500:25:33,277 --> 00:25:35,590This may require scale development.47600:25:35,785 --> 00:25:39,697For example, you cannot directly observe acceptability47700:25:39,916 --> 00:25:42,928but rather can combine a series of questions that together47800:25:43,116 --> 00:25:45,092infer acceptability.47900:25:45,271 --> 00:25:47,346This concludes chapter three and our discussion48000:25:47,562 --> 00:25:50,250on how to measure implementation research outcomes.
