000:00:04,009 --> 00:00:08,071Here we are going to continue with our review of these studies100:00:08,280 --> 00:00:10,755that have used implementation research outcomes,200:00:10,889 --> 00:00:13,476and we're going to be looking at two additional papers300:00:13,632 --> 00:00:16,645in addition to the four papers that we have examined400:00:16,839 --> 00:00:18,289in the second video.500:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,730In the fifth example, we look at how600:00:21,927 --> 00:00:24,715the impact of pre-packaging antimalarials700:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,575and what is the impact of these on early treatment of childhood fever.800:00:28,730 --> 00:00:31,455This is the study that was done by Sirima et al900:00:31,661 --> 00:00:33,736in  Burkina Faso and they were looking1000:00:33,937 --> 00:00:36,587at whether training mothers on how to use1100:00:36,766 --> 00:00:41,353pre-packaged antimalarials could help to control malaria1200:00:41,481 --> 00:00:42,656for very young children.1300:00:42,819 --> 00:00:45,469So these are malaria drugs that have been pre-packaged1400:00:45,618 --> 00:00:48,106by dose for different age groups,1500:00:48,328 --> 00:00:51,478and the mothers were provided training on how to use these.1600:00:51,719 --> 00:00:54,756And again, they looked at whether mothers were indeed able1700:00:54,972 --> 00:00:57,172to carry out what they were trained to do.1800:00:57,363 --> 00:00:59,563That is to say they measured fidelity:1900:00:59,728 --> 00:01:01,915to what extent can mothers carry out2000:01:02,067 --> 00:01:04,567the set of implementation activities2100:01:04,751 --> 00:01:07,801around the delivery of the pre-packaged antimalarials2200:01:07,971 --> 00:01:09,433for their children.2300:01:09,664 --> 00:01:13,014And at the end, they found that yes, indeed with appropriate training2400:01:13,198 --> 00:01:15,735mothers actually can do this successfully.2500:01:15,908 --> 00:01:19,595That is to say, that the programme had high fidelity2600:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,848and the additional thing that they did in this study,2700:01:23,034 --> 00:01:26,259is that they were able to show how this change in implementation2800:01:26,477 --> 00:01:30,339research outcome that is, fidelity, was linked to health outcomes2900:01:30,541 --> 00:01:33,066because they were able to also show in the same study3000:01:33,244 --> 00:01:36,519that not only was there high fidelity with regards to3100:01:36,723 --> 00:01:39,948the way the mothers were using the pre-packaged antimalarials3200:01:40,122 --> 00:01:43,772but they were also able to show that this led to the reduction3300:01:43,962 --> 00:01:47,900in the incidence of severe malaria.3400:01:48,077 --> 00:01:52,190So the last example that we're going to see today3500:01:52,369 --> 00:01:56,056from the projects that have been supported by TDR3600:01:56,229 --> 00:02:00,054is a study by Akogun et al in Nigeria.3700:02:00,207 --> 00:02:02,832The study looked at community directed treatment3800:02:03,021 --> 00:02:02,221of onchocerciasis with ivermectin.3900:02:05,987 --> 00:02:08,875So they were looking at testing different strategies4000:02:09,058 --> 00:02:13,496in delivering ivermectin within the community.4100:02:13,662 --> 00:02:15,312So there were two main [strategies] here.4200:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,687We had a set of strategies4300:02:17,911 --> 00:02:20,074that were designed according to the programme4400:02:20,231 --> 00:02:23,006and then we had another set of strategies that were designed4500:02:23,190 --> 00:02:24,715by the community themselves,4600:02:24,920 --> 00:02:28,207and then both of these strategies were compared 4700:02:28,418 --> 00:02:30,743to the current status quo, that is to say,4800:02:30,944 --> 00:02:34,919having the whole system run the programme as it normally had been4900:02:35,107 --> 00:02:38,007even before the strategies were implemented.5000:02:38,174 --> 00:02:41,187And they tested even these different strategies5100:02:41,373 --> 00:02:45,973by looking at changes in fidelity, coverage, cost and feasibility,5200:02:46,202 --> 00:02:51,002and they were able to show that either the programme design strategy,5300:02:51,168 --> 00:02:54,155that is to say, choosing village heads5400:02:54,371 --> 00:02:57,883or women within the community to deliver ivermectin5500:02:58,066 --> 00:03:01,353or the community designed strategy that ,5600:03:01,523 --> 00:03:04,785they actually worked in terms of adhering5700:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,2605800:03:04,957 --> 00:03:07,532to the core components of the control programmes.5900:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,680And they also saw that the cost was reasonable, even overtime,6000:03:10,841 --> 00:03:14,479and the coverage of the ivermectin control6100:03:14,648 --> 00:03:17,010was sufficiently high and then, that indeed that6200:03:17,215 --> 00:03:18,740it was possible, it was feasible6300:03:18,926 --> 00:03:21,539for the these different strategies to be carried out6400:03:21,693 --> 00:03:23,193within this community.6500:03:23,346 --> 00:03:27,433In this second section, we're looking at how relevant6600:03:27,592 --> 00:03:30,792implementation research outcomes are for different stages6700:03:30,998 --> 00:03:33,223or phases of implementation research.6800:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,587Remember during the introduction6900:03:35,746 --> 00:03:39,696we have discussed implementation activities, research or practice7000:03:39,839 --> 00:03:42,576as involving three main phases.7100:03:42,754 --> 00:03:46,517The first phase is the early phase where you're contemplating7200:03:46,675 --> 00:03:50,425or planning, or deciding to implement7300:03:50,587 --> 00:03:52,862an evidence based intervention.7400:03:53,048 --> 00:03:56,148And then the second phase is the middle phase7500:03:56,315 --> 00:03:59,827where the intervention has been ongoing for quite a while7600:04:00,004 --> 00:04:03,916and the concern is around ensuring quality of delivery7700:04:04,090 --> 00:04:06,490and continuous improvement overtime.7800:04:06,651 --> 00:04:09,626And the last phase is when the intervention has been done7900:04:09,806 --> 00:04:13,581for some time, and one is beginning to transition into integrating8000:04:13,765 --> 00:04:16,565the intervention into the current system8100:04:16,715 --> 00:04:19,203within the setting or the organization8200:04:19,388 --> 00:04:21,613What we found out is that different types8300:04:21,779 --> 00:04:25,904 of implementation research outcomes are actually useful as measures8400:04:26,069 --> 00:04:30,231of success, during the different phases of implementation.8500:04:30,403 --> 00:04:33,916For the early phase, measures such as acceptability,8600:04:34,082 --> 00:04:37,020such as feasibility or appropriateness8700:04:37,181 --> 00:04:40,431are useful to help us gauge the readiness8800:04:40,581 --> 00:04:43,344of the particular organization or setting,8900:04:43,534 --> 00:04:45,609in adopting an intervention9000:04:45,778 --> 00:04:50,091or also engaging the likelihood of success of the intervention.9100:04:50,846 --> 00:04:53,234And thenother measures like acceptability,9200:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,162adoption, feasibility, fidelity, cost and coverage,9300:04:58,319 --> 00:05:01,844are useful for the middle phase when the intervention9400:05:01,996 --> 00:05:04,071would have been carried out for some time.9500:05:04,229 --> 00:05:07,416So you see, it doesn't make sense for us to begin to measure fidelity9600:05:07,570 --> 00:05:08,870during the early phase,9700:05:09,044 --> 00:05:11,319because [the] early phase is still the time9800:05:11,472 --> 00:05:14,060when we're still planning and we're trying to carry out9900:05:14,258 --> 00:05:15,933the intervention as we should.10000:05:16,113 --> 00:05:19,176While it makes a lot of sense for us to begin to measure fidelity,10100:05:19,332 --> 00:05:22,144that is to say, what is the quality of the delivery,10200:05:22,319 --> 00:05:25,669to what extent are they adhering to the protocol of the intervention10300:05:25,814 --> 00:05:28,164during the middle phase when the intervention10400:05:28,317 --> 00:05:30,280has been ongoing for a while.10500:05:30,428 --> 00:05:33,191And then we have the late implementation stage10600:05:33,336 --> 00:05:37,173where we're thinking more of integrating the intervention10700:05:37,359 --> 00:05:40,597into an existing system, and here we're thinking about10800:05:40,771 --> 00:05:44,859issues of sustainability, we're thinking about issues10900:05:45,027 --> 00:05:47,439around coverage; how can we increase the coverage,11000:05:47,577 --> 00:05:51,615how can we scale up the intervention and so on and so forth.11100:05:51,774 --> 00:05:54,711So we have specific implementation research outcomes11200:05:54,860 --> 00:05:57,597that are also appropriate for this stage.11300:05:57,769 --> 00:06:01,694The point to make in section two, is that different types11400:06:01,853 --> 00:06:05,616of implementation research outcomes are relevant for measuring11500:06:05,843 --> 00:06:09,268effectiveness of implementation activities at different stages.11600:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,328There are some implementation research outcomes11700:06:12,518 --> 00:06:14,493that are useful during the early stage,11800:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,303there are some that are useful during the middle stage,11900:06:17,418 --> 00:06:20,418and there are others that are useful during the late stage.12000:06:20,568 --> 00:06:23,468The importance is to be able to know at what stage12100:06:23,598 --> 00:06:26,323the implementation activity is, and what set12200:06:26,466 --> 00:06:29,504of implementation research outcomes to prescribe as the test12300:06:29,707 --> 00:06:32,169of our implementation research effectiveness.12400:06:32,396 --> 00:06:34,921So in this section, we're going to be looking at12500:06:35,102 --> 00:06:38,389the usefulness of implementation research outcomes12600:06:38,556 --> 00:06:41,881as measures of contextual factors that could be used12700:06:42,074 --> 00:06:43,924to access health system readiness.12800:06:44,131 --> 00:06:46,506We acknowledge that there are other indicators12900:06:46,703 --> 00:06:48,615 that are in use or that have been proposed.13000:06:48,737 --> 00:06:51,212For instance, some people use the balance score card13100:06:51,362 --> 00:06:52,712and some people use 13200:06:52,884 --> 00:06:55,096the service readiness assessment tool designed13300:06:55,284 --> 00:06:59,009by WHO as measures of some contextual factors13400:06:59,186 --> 00:07:01,249at the downstream of the health system,13500:07:01,413 --> 00:07:03,688even as a measure of health system readiness.13600:07:03,913 --> 00:07:07,088However, the utility of implementation research outcomes13700:07:07,241 --> 00:07:10,853is that it could be used to measure some upstream contextual factors.13800:07:10,973 --> 00:07:13,661Example of downstream contextual factors13900:07:13,824 --> 00:07:16,686would be things like infrastructure that are available14000:07:16,906 --> 00:07:20,194within the health system, the staffing, level of staffing,14100:07:20,366 --> 00:07:23,154the level of resources that is available to the staff14200:07:23,328 --> 00:07:24,553and so on and so forth.14300:07:24,715 --> 00:07:27,590There are tools that are useful n for doing this already.14400:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,052However, some of these tools do not measure14500:07:30,225 --> 00:07:33,488optional factors such as what is the willingness14600:07:33,654 --> 00:07:36,342of a community to adopt an intervention,14700:07:36,496 --> 00:07:38,458is there a push? Is there a pull?14800:07:38,608 --> 00:07:41,958Is there a demand for implementation  activities, and so on and so forth?14900:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,643This is where implementation research outcomes15000:07:44,765 --> 00:07:47,990could serve as a complement to some of the existing tools15100:07:48,133 --> 00:07:50,283for assessing health system readiness.15200:07:50,444 --> 00:07:53,094For instance, we might be interested in knowing15300:07:53,260 --> 00:07:55,935who are our main stakeholders for the adoption15400:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,16015500:07:56,103 --> 00:07:57,578of this intervention.15600:07:57,747 --> 00:08:00,109We might be interested in knowing whether there is  the demand15700:08:00,306 --> 00:08:02,031to implement the intervention.15800:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,893We might be also interested to know, is there a push out by donors15900:08:06,038 --> 00:08:09,338or by some other stakeholders who are external to the setting16000:08:09,495 --> 00:08:12,095in which the intervention is going to be implemented,16100:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,395or might in fact want to know whether there is a pull.16200:08:14,607 --> 00:08:17,170That is to say, are the community really making a demand?16300:08:17,333 --> 00:08:20,970Are they really eager to have interventions in place16400:08:21,108 --> 00:08:22,545within their settings?16500:08:22,728 --> 00:08:25,665Or we might also want to know what are the infrastructures?16600:08:25,811 --> 00:08:28,336Apart from the infrastructures that are available16700:08:28,503 --> 00:08:31,078at the health system level, what are the infrastructures16800:08:31,267 --> 00:08:33,967that are available that will enhance even the smooth uptake16900:08:34,150 --> 00:08:35,250of the intervention?17000:08:35,451 --> 00:08:38,601For all of these broad domains, implementation research outcomes17100:08:38,794 --> 00:08:40,119could really be useful.17200:08:40,314 --> 00:08:43,302So the point here is this, that implementation research outcome17300:08:43,504 --> 00:08:44,841has utility.17400:08:45,034 --> 00:08:47,984It has utility for testing implementation effectiveness.17500:08:48,147 --> 00:08:51,072It is salient for different stages of implementation17600:08:51,221 --> 00:08:54,246and again, it is also useful for assessing17700:08:54,406 --> 00:08:57,643upstream contextual factors that can allow us to gauge17800:08:57,802 --> 00:09:01,915the readiness of the health systems to adopt an intervention.17900:09:02,692 --> 00:09:06,167We're going to round up this chapter by looking again,18000:09:06,345 --> 00:09:08,933at the quiz that we presented at the very beginning.18100:09:09,089 --> 00:09:12,601I know by now, a lot of the concepts and a lot of the questions18200:09:12,764 --> 00:09:15,314that were asked in the quiz would have become more clear18300:09:15,494 --> 00:09:16,481to you18400:09:16,602 --> 00:09:19,964So let's look together again, at the quiz questions18500:09:20,112 --> 00:09:22,224and let's see what the right answers are.18600:09:22,378 --> 00:09:26,990So the first question we had asked you if the following are examples18700:09:27,147 --> 00:09:28,997of implementation research outcomes.18800:09:29,189 --> 00:09:32,164Mortality, mobility, and disease incidence.18900:09:32,327 --> 00:09:35,427So you will agree with me that these are really health outcomes19000:09:35,588 --> 00:09:38,751and they are not examples of implementation research outcomes.19100:09:39,490 --> 00:09:43,290The second question asked you if implementation research outcomes19200:09:43,450 --> 00:09:45,338are only single-domain constructs19300:09:45,573 --> 00:09:48,036and if they are heuristically defined.19400:09:48,197 --> 00:09:50,472 Again, the right answer here19500:09:50,702 --> 00:09:54,365will be false, because we know that implementation research outcomes19600:09:54,518 --> 00:09:57,755could be construed as single-domain constructs19700:09:57,953 --> 00:10:00,778such as implementation costs, acceptability,19800:10:00,948 --> 00:10:05,073or they could also be construed as multi-domain constructs19900:10:05,219 --> 00:10:08,056such as fidelity and feasibility.20000:10:08,214 --> 00:10:12,089However, we know that invariably all implementation research outcomes20100:10:12,271 --> 00:10:14,183are heuristically defined.20200:10:14,343 --> 00:10:17,380We said that they are defined based on the actual experience20300:10:17,535 --> 00:10:18,997of the implementation.20400:10:19,142 --> 00:10:21,667That is to say, their definition is operationalized20500:10:21,781 --> 00:10:25,881based on how the implementation activities are carried out.20600:10:26,037 --> 00:10:30,012Now, the third question asked you whether implementation fidelity20700:10:30,143 --> 00:10:32,468could be assessed by examining adherence20800:10:32,628 --> 00:10:35,503to the intervention protocol and quality of delivery.20900:10:35,658 --> 00:10:37,795And the right response here, is true.21000:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,626Measure of adherence, measures of quality of delivery21100:10:41,777 --> 00:10:45,702of dosage, of frequency and so on, are examples of ways21200:10:45,843 --> 00:10:48,668by which we can take measures of implementation fidelity.21300:10:48,839 --> 00:10:51,939And then the fourth question asked you21400:10:52,109 --> 00:10:55,359whether various implementation research outcomes are relevant21500:10:55,413 --> 00:10:59,275for research focused on different temporal stages of implementation.21600:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,042Yes, the answer here is true.21700:11:01,221 --> 00:11:03,633Remember that diagram that we showed you21800:11:03,776 --> 00:11:05,789that we can think about implementation21900:11:05,949 --> 00:11:07,599consisting of different stages22000:11:07,777 --> 00:11:10,964The early stage, the middle stage and the late stage,22100:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,565and we said that different types of implementation research outcomes22200:11:14,728 --> 00:11:18,978are relevant, are salient for these different stages of implementation.22300:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,649And the last question asked you, whether fidelity measures22400:11:22,802 --> 00:11:25,877are some of the most common implementation research outcomes22500:11:26,015 --> 00:11:28,078in assessing health systems' readiness.22600:11:28,243 --> 00:11:30,693Now, the right answer here is false.22700:11:30,855 --> 00:11:33,768However, this is a little bit tricky because we really22800:11:33,933 --> 00:11:36,433need to think about what we're  trying to accomplish22900:11:36,501 --> 00:11:38,438when we measure health systems' readiness.23000:11:38,500 --> 00:11:40,388When we measure health systems' readiness,23100:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,600we're trying to gauge the readiness of the health systems.23200:11:43,764 --> 00:11:46,414We're trying to gauge the willingness of participants23300:11:46,498 --> 00:11:47,786to adapt to intervention,23400:11:47,886 --> 00:11:50,223we're trying to assess the strengths and the weaknesses 23500:11:50,390 --> 00:11:51,715within the system.23600:11:51,864 --> 00:11:55,201We're trying to use that to predict how successful our intervention,23700:11:55,331 --> 00:11:57,918or our implementation activities are going to be.23800:11:58,086 --> 00:12:01,374However, when we do measures of fidelity,23900:12:01,548 --> 00:12:03,773we actually would have had to be carrying out24000:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,403the implementation projects.24100:12:05,550 --> 00:12:08,625So you see that, in that regard, implementation fidelity24200:12:08,795 --> 00:12:11,745might not be a good measure of our system's readiness.24300:12:11,885 --> 00:12:16,335So, this concludes chapter two, of module four,24400:12:16,491 --> 00:12:18,978and when we come back in chapter three,24500:12:19,142 --> 00:12:21,292we're going to be looking at how to measure24600:12:21,423 --> 00:12:25,723implementation research outcomes, thank you.
