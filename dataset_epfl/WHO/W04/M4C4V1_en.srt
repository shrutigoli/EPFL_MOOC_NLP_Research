1
00:00:04,675 --> 00:00:06,938
So why don't we go ahead
and end with an exercise

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:10,529
that we developed to give you 
an opportunity to apply

3
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:13,958
some of these concepts
to a real world problem. 

4
00:00:14,164 --> 00:00:17,512
So online you'll see that there are 
two papers that you can choose from.

5
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:19,359
Go ahead and pick 
one of the papers

6
00:00:19,568 --> 00:00:22,530
that you find the most interesting,
read it and then go ahead 

7
00:00:22,753 --> 00:00:26,940
and answer some of these questions
or tasks that we played out. 

8
00:00:27,122 --> 00:00:31,134
The first is for you to identify
the implementation problem

9
00:00:31,345 --> 00:00:34,032
that's presented in the paper,
and if applicable, 

10
00:00:34,224 --> 00:00:37,875
an implementation strategy that 
was also presented on that paper.

11
00:00:38,067 --> 00:00:41,355
And next, we actually want you 
to identify the implementation

12
00:00:41,551 --> 00:00:44,414
of such outcomes that was used
in testing the strategy 

13
00:00:44,605 --> 00:00:47,818
or the set of implementation 
activities that were put in place

14
00:00:48,021 --> 00:00:50,658
in the paper, and I want you 
to go on and describe 

15
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:53,868
how the implementation research 
outcomes are personalized. 

16
00:00:54,034 --> 00:00:56,635
That is to say, how was it 
defined in the paper, 

17
00:00:56,816 --> 00:01:00,179
and how was the measure taken 
in terms of the data collection

18
00:01:00,387 --> 00:01:02,049
and approach and the methodology.

19
00:01:02,254 --> 00:01:04,467
As you know, 
there are many different ways

20
00:01:04,671 --> 00:01:06,696
that you can collect data 
for the same set 

21
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:08,800
of implementation research 
outcomes.

22
00:01:08,997 --> 00:01:11,872
So, lot's of times this decision
is based in part by looking 

23
00:01:12,065 --> 00:01:14,540
at the pros and cons
of the data collection methods

24
00:01:14,733 --> 00:01:17,671
or the biases that are inherent
that data collection method,

25
00:01:17,892 --> 00:01:21,467
but it also takes to account
the resource and time constraints 

26
00:01:21,661 --> 00:01:24,299
of the organization 
that's collecting data

27
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:27,397
So, what we'd like you to do
is suggest alternative ways 

28
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,200
of collecting data for the same set
of implementation research outcomes

29
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,811
that's presented in the paper. 

30
00:01:33,002 --> 00:01:36,390
And for all this write-up, 
we actually want you to limit

31
00:01:36,586 --> 00:01:38,236
your write-up to 1500 words. 

32
00:01:38,406 --> 00:01:41,606
We don't want you to exceed
2 pages and if you be so kind 

33
00:01:41,823 --> 00:01:44,111
to upload it into 
the dedicated folder

34
00:01:44,315 --> 00:01:46,377
that has been provided 
for the exercise.

35
00:01:46,578 --> 00:01:49,278
So thank you again 
for participating in module 4, 

36
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,021
every one of the implementation 
research or course.

37
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:54,556
We hope you have enjoyed 
listening to us.
