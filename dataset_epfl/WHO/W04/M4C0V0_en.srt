000:00:04,251 --> 00:00:07,026Hi, my name is Pascale Allotey.100:00:07,226 --> 00:00:10,226I am Professor of Public Health, Head of Global Public Health,200:00:10,426 --> 00:00:14,709and Associate Director of the South East Asia Community Observatory300:00:14,909 --> 00:00:17,472at the Monash University campus in Malaysia.400:00:17,672 --> 00:00:19,985This is the fourth of the five modules500:00:20,185 --> 00:00:24,272of the Massive Open Online Course on implementation research,600:00:24,472 --> 00:00:27,472developed by the Special Program for Research and Training700:00:27,672 --> 00:00:29,175in Tropical Diseases.800:00:29,375 --> 00:00:32,375This module will take you through one of the most important900:00:32,575 --> 00:00:35,865but also most challenging areas of implementation research,1000:00:36,065 --> 00:00:39,614namely, how to evaluate implementation research1100:00:39,814 --> 00:00:45,109by clearly articulating appropriate implementation research outcomes.1200:00:45,288 --> 00:00:48,690An important point to recap here is that the purpose of1300:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,902implementation research is to address those challenges that enable1400:00:53,140 --> 00:00:55,990interventions to reach target populations.1500:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,190Therefore the success of implementation strategy1600:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,690is not necessarily measured1700:01:01,890 --> 00:01:04,890 in the same way as the success of the intervention.1800:01:05,090 --> 00:01:07,202The question we want to answer here1900:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,290is how do we assess research that addresses implementation problems2000:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,745independent from those that study the efficacy of the intervention.2100:01:15,945 --> 00:01:18,120The module is presented by2200:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,420Dr. Olakunle Alonge and Dr. Vivian Go,2300:01:21,620 --> 00:01:24,208and consists of three chapters.2400:01:24,408 --> 00:01:28,598The first chapter distinguishes between efficacy of an intervention2500:01:28,798 --> 00:01:30,994and implementation effectiveness.2600:01:31,194 --> 00:01:35,793The second describes examples of implementation research outcomes.2700:01:35,993 --> 00:01:38,462And the third describes how to measure2800:01:38,662 --> 00:01:40,650implementation research outcomes.2900:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,055The module is developed to be interactive,3000:01:43,255 --> 00:01:46,255with a number of journal articles that have been included3100:01:46,455 --> 00:01:48,244as required readings.3200:01:48,444 --> 00:01:51,866At the end of module 4, two papers will be presented3300:01:52,066 --> 00:01:54,570and you will be required to:3400:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,770identify an implementation issue in the case example3500:01:57,970 --> 00:02:00,746and the implementation strategy,3600:02:00,972 --> 00:02:04,659identify the implementation research outcomes,3700:02:04,872 --> 00:02:08,545describe how these outcomes were measured,3800:02:08,745 --> 00:02:12,743and, finally, suggest alternative approaches3900:02:12,943 --> 00:02:15,781for assessing implementation research outcomes.4000:02:15,981 --> 00:02:20,035If you have been working your way systematically through the course,4100:02:20,235 --> 00:02:22,140I hope you're growing in confidence4200:02:22,340 --> 00:02:25,340about undertaking implementation research.4300:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,828If this is your first visit to the site,4400:02:28,028 --> 00:02:29,619very warm welcome,4500:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,819and I would strongly encourage you to browse through4600:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,856the first three modules4700:02:35,056 --> 00:02:37,394that introduce implementation research,4800:02:37,594 --> 00:02:40,986that provide an overview of how to address different contexts4900:02:41,186 --> 00:02:43,410in which implementation research projects5000:02:43,611 --> 00:02:45,586can be designed and undertaken,5100:02:45,786 --> 00:02:47,873and help you to identify and design5200:02:48,098 --> 00:02:50,623the appropriate implementation strategy.5300:02:50,823 --> 00:02:52,173Have fun!
