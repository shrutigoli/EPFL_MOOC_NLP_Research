<i>Mr. Azuero, can you tell us something</i>
<i>about the training of the team during the project</i>
<i>and why it was done that way?</i>
The team training was very important.
Starting from their existing knowledge, we set up a process of continuing development, looking afresh at all the components of vector control, new options, expectations, and, in parallel, identification of all the stages of the vector
-adult, larva, pupa - the most efficient way to identify a pupa and finally to complete the cycle.
This allowed the personnel to become more versatile and their work much more effective in the field.
<i>Here in the town of Buga, what kinds of breeding sites</i>
<i>were found and what were the most promising</i>
<i>in terms of potential interventions?</i>
Bearing in mind that Buga is a town whose hydroclimatic and geographic conditions are very favourable to the vector, we have certain breeding sites which are very active, namely the catch basins or storm drains which have standing water and are consistently positive for the vector and where we need to be continually intervening.
We have tanks, flower vases, discarded containers, rubbish and worn-out items that have built up where they shouldn't be, and collecting water in the area around the house.
Roof gutters, trays under fridges, pools and small tanks which have various uses, have been identified as potential breeding sites, meaning that whenever they collect water they can be highly productive
<i>What are the control options for each type of breeding site?</i>
There's chemical control which is specific to catch basins.
The other kinds of containers like vases are controlled physically, meaning they're emptied out
in conjunction with educational messages.
It wouldn't be appropriate or effective to treat all such containers with larvicide because it would be culturally counter-productive in hindering the development of the citizens' own responsibility at the expense of generating an expectation that health personnel would come to solve the problem.
That's why we rely on source reduction and education for this type of container.
<i>Can you give us some idea of the kinds of resources,</i> human or other resources, available for the intervention?
For the treatment and control of the disease and its vector, resources are very important but equally their use has to be optimized.
We're talking about human resources, suitably trained, economic resources, academic resources for key knowledge, logistic resources such as vehicles for transport, and additional skills such as epidemiology and statistics.
<i>And as a result of the project's findings, was there</i>
<i>any change in the way the resources were allocated?</i>
Resource allocation has improved a lot.
Following the results of the project it was possible to show that elimination of the vector and the disease was not feasible and the best strategy is to target resources in a data-driven way to reduce vector abundance and improve the incidence of dengue that we've had for years.
We've managed a significant reduction which empowers decision-makers by clearly showing them the outcomes of these processes, resulting in an improvement in resources allocated to them.
<i>In terms of dengue incidence,</i>
<i>how was the effect of the intervention to be measured?</i>
In other words, how was it possible to know whether or not
<i>the intervention worked, in terms of dengue incidence?</i>
This is important because we couldn't compare with ourselves.
It's difficult to compare the cases between one year and another because we don't know exactly what was driving it.
So we needed to take a control unit to make this comparison.
In out case this was a nearby municipality with the same geographical, climatological, and hydrological characteristics, as well as similar cultural behaviours.
By making this comparison it was possible to analyse the overall data and hence evaluate the process developed here within the project.
<i>And how did that comparison turn out?</i>
Compared to the other municipality, there was a very marked and important reduction.
The endemic channels and the entomological sampling showed that the cases reduced enormously and that the vector was reduced close to zero, thanks obviously to continual control and entomological and epidemiological surveillance, but using the nearby municipality as a control demonstrated a very large reduction.
