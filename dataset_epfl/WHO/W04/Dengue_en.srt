1
00:00:00,959 --> 00:00:02,933
<i>Mr. Azuero, can you
tell us something</i>

2
00:00:03,133 --> 00:00:06,008
<i>about the training of the team
during the project</i>

3
00:00:06,196 --> 00:00:09,105
<i>and why it was done that way?</i>

4
00:00:09,305 --> 00:00:13,547
The team training was very important.

5
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:18,823
Starting from their existing
knowledge,

6
00:00:19,023 --> 00:00:26,127
we set up a process of continuing
development,

7
00:00:26,327 --> 00:00:32,297
looking afresh at all the components
of vector control,

8
00:00:32,497 --> 00:00:37,804
new options, expectations, and,
in parallel,

9
00:00:38,004 --> 00:00:42,650
identification of all the stages
of the vector

10
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:47,229
-adult, larva, pupa - the most
efficient way

11
00:00:47,429 --> 00:00:50,746
to identify a pupa and finally
to complete the cycle.

12
00:00:50,946 --> 00:00:56,833
This allowed the personnel to
become more versatile

13
00:00:57,033 --> 00:01:02,122
and their work much more effective
in the field.

14
00:01:02,322 --> 00:01:06,622
<i>Here in the town of Buga, what
kinds of breeding sites</i>

15
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:10,136
<i>were found and what were
the most promising</i>

16
00:01:10,336 --> 00:01:13,336
<i>in terms of potential interventions?</i>

17
00:01:13,536 --> 00:01:18,990
Bearing in mind that Buga is a town
whose hydroclimatic

18
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,215
and geographic conditions are very
favourable to the vector,

19
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:25,003
we have certain breeding
sites which are very active,

20
00:01:25,203 --> 00:01:27,560
namely the catch basins
or storm drains

21
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,997
which have standing water
and are consistently positive

22
00:01:31,197 --> 00:01:38,910
for the vector and where we need
to be continually intervening.

23
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:45,981
We have tanks, flower vases,
discarded containers,

24
00:01:46,181 --> 00:01:52,181
rubbish and worn-out items
that have built up

25
00:01:52,381 --> 00:01:54,569
where they shouldn't be, and
collecting water

26
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:56,725
in the area around the house.

27
00:01:56,925 --> 00:02:02,225
Roof gutters, trays
under fridges, pools

28
00:02:02,425 --> 00:02:05,875
and small tanks which
have various uses,

29
00:02:06,075 --> 00:02:13,389
have been identified as potential
breeding sites,

30
00:02:13,589 --> 00:02:21,926
meaning that whenever they collect
water they can be highly productive

31
00:02:22,126 --> 00:02:34,250
<i>What are the control options
for each type of breeding site?</i>

32
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:38,550
There's chemical control which is

33
00:02:38,762 --> 00:02:46,849
specific to catch basins.
(storm drains)

34
00:02:47,049 --> 00:02:53,648
The other kinds of containers like
vases are controlled physically,

35
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:56,211
meaning they're emptied out

36
00:02:56,411 --> 00:02:58,711
 in conjunction with
educational messages.

37
00:02:58,911 --> 00:03:03,476
It wouldn't be
appropriate or effective

38
00:03:03,676 --> 00:03:09,140
to treat all such containers with
larvicide

39
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:12,003
because it would be culturally
counter-productive

40
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,839
in hindering the development

41
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:16,226
of the citizens' own
responsibility

42
00:03:16,426 --> 00:03:18,889
at the expense of generating
an expectation

43
00:03:19,089 --> 00:03:22,298
that health personnel would come
to solve the problem.

44
00:03:22,498 --> 00:03:24,961
That's why we rely on
source reduction

45
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:29,353
and education for this
type of container.

46
00:03:29,553 --> 00:03:36,150
<i>Can you give us some idea of the
kinds of resources,</i>

47
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:42,464
human or other resources, 
available for the intervention?

48
00:03:42,664 --> 00:03:48,366
For the treatment and
control of the disease

49
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:52,229
and its vector, resources
are very important

50
00:03:52,429 --> 00:03:54,866
but equally their use
has to be optimized.

51
00:03:55,066 --> 00:03:57,796
We're talking about human resources,
suitably trained,

52
00:03:57,996 --> 00:04:07,761
economic resources, academic
resources for key knowledge,

53
00:04:07,961 --> 00:04:13,989
logistic resources such as
vehicles for transport,

54
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:24,244
and additional skills such as
epidemiology and statistics.

55
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:30,642
<i>And as a result of the project's
findings, was there</i>

56
00:04:30,842 --> 00:04:37,969
<i>any change in the way the
resources were allocated?</i>

57
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:41,336
Resource allocation has
improved a lot.

58
00:04:41,536 --> 00:04:47,096
Following the results of the project
it was possible to show

59
00:04:47,296 --> 00:04:56,710
that elimination of the vector
and the disease

60
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:01,671
was not feasible and the best
strategy is to target resources

61
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:08,935
in a data-driven way to
reduce vector abundance

62
00:05:09,135 --> 00:05:14,990
and improve the incidence of dengue
that we've had for years.

63
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:18,190
We've managed a significant
reduction which

64
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:20,565
empowers decision-makers

65
00:05:20,765 --> 00:05:25,512
by clearly showing them the outcomes
of these processes,

66
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:31,831
resulting in an improvement
in resources allocated to them.

67
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:37,993
<i>In terms of dengue incidence,</i>

68
00:05:38,193 --> 00:05:43,324
<i>how was the effect of the
intervention to be measured?</i>

69
00:05:43,524 --> 00:05:47,207
In other words, how was it
possible to know whether or not

70
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,032
<i>the intervention worked, in terms
of dengue incidence?</i>

71
00:05:51,232 --> 00:05:57,208
This is important because we
couldn't compare with ourselves.

72
00:05:57,408 --> 00:06:04,068
It's difficult to compare the cases
between one year and another

73
00:06:04,268 --> 00:06:08,218
because we don't know exactly
what was driving it.

74
00:06:08,418 --> 00:06:13,414
So we needed to take a control unit
to make this comparison.

75
00:06:09,268 --> 00:06:11,593


76
00:06:13,614 --> 00:06:18,705
In out case this was a nearby
municipality

77
00:06:18,905 --> 00:06:21,614
with the same geographical,
climatological,

78
00:06:21,827 --> 00:06:23,739
and hydrological characteristics,

79
00:06:23,939 --> 00:06:26,739
as well as similar cultural
behaviours.

80
00:06:26,939 --> 00:06:33,029
By making this comparison it was
possible to analyse the overall data

81
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:38,838
and hence evaluate the process
developed here within the project.

82
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,414
<i>And how did that
comparison turn out?</i>

83
00:06:43,614 --> 00:06:46,614
Compared to the other municipality,

84
00:06:46,814 --> 00:06:49,814
there was a very marked and
important reduction.

85
00:06:50,014 --> 00:06:55,512
The endemic channels and the
entomological sampling

86
00:06:55,712 --> 00:07:02,557
showed that the cases reduced
enormously

87
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:06,919
and that the vector was
reduced close to zero,

88
00:07:07,119 --> 00:07:12,991
thanks obviously to continual
control and entomological

89
00:07:13,191 --> 00:07:16,191
and epidemiological surveillance,

90
00:07:16,391 --> 00:07:19,391
but using the nearby municipality

91
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:22,591
as a control demonstrated a very
large reduction.
