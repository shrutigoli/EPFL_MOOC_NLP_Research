00:00:04,321 --> 00:00:07,859
Hi, it's Oladele again.

2
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,275
Still talking about

3
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:13,560
implementation research in module 1

4
00:00:14,625 --> 00:00:16,062
and describing

5
00:00:16,242 --> 00:00:19,018
what implementation research is.

6
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:21,801
In this chapter, which is chapter 2,

7
00:00:21,981 --> 00:00:23,231
will be discussing

8
00:00:23,399 --> 00:00:25,112
how implementation research

9
00:00:25,284 --> 00:00:27,710
lives up to the promise.

10
00:00:28,012 --> 00:00:29,462
In this chapter,

11
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,017
we shall discuss

12
00:00:32,192 --> 00:00:34,743
home management of malaria

13
00:00:34,919 --> 00:00:37,606
and community based interventions

14
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,636
which are two illustrative examples

15
00:00:40,812 --> 00:00:43,363
of implementation research.

16
00:00:43,671 --> 00:00:45,096
We start with

17
00:00:45,272 --> 00:00:48,748
the home management of malaria.

18
00:00:48,966 --> 00:00:50,790
Due to lack of access

19
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:52,490
to health facility

20
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:54,373
most malaria episodes

21
00:00:54,536 --> 00:00:57,074
are first managed at home.

22
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,703
Using medicines that are purchased

23
00:00:59,872 --> 00:01:01,745
from itinerant vendors

24
00:01:01,938 --> 00:01:05,126
are from local shops like this one.

25
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:08,448
Treatment delays in current treatment

26
00:01:08,614 --> 00:01:10,439
poor quality drugs

27
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:12,398
are common, leading to

28
00:01:12,595 --> 00:01:17,358
poor management outcome of malaria.

29
00:01:17,837 --> 00:01:19,961
Sadly, many children die

30
00:01:20,147 --> 00:01:23,058
within 48 hours of the onset

31
00:01:23,228 --> 00:01:25,528
of the symptom of malaria.

32
00:01:25,706 --> 00:01:26,593
The prompt use

33
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:29,911
of effective anti-malaria medicines

34
00:01:30,091 --> 00:01:32,016
close to the home,

35
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,165
helps to alleviate

36
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:35,774
this unpleasant consequence

37
00:01:35,959 --> 00:01:39,109
brought about by lack of access.

38
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:41,546
In the 1990s,

39
00:01:41,728 --> 00:01:44,214
TDR studies showed

40
00:01:44,384 --> 00:01:47,109
that adherence to treatment

41
00:01:47,295 --> 00:01:49,470
improves when malaria

42
00:01:49,654 --> 00:01:52,690
is pre-packaged in unit doses,

43
00:01:52,874 --> 00:01:54,212
such as this.

44
00:01:54,469 --> 00:01:57,119
Quality of treatment also improves

45
00:01:57,285 --> 00:02:00,835
when trained community-based providers

46
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,380
are responsible

47
00:02:02,552 --> 00:02:03,815
for service delivery

48
00:02:04,005 --> 00:02:05,217
close to the home.

49
00:02:05,406 --> 00:02:06,768
The drastic reduction

50
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:10,273
in child mortality due to malaria

51
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:12,354
is clearly demonstrated

52
00:02:12,523 --> 00:02:15,297
in Burkina Faso and Ethiopia,

53
00:02:15,462 --> 00:02:16,712
when this approach

54
00:02:16,888 --> 00:02:19,726
of pre-packaged anti-malaria

55
00:02:19,902 --> 00:02:20,752
was used

56
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:23,739
and community-based providers

57
00:02:23,930 --> 00:02:24,869
were trained

58
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:27,035
on how to deliver this and this.

59
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:28,861
Let us now discuss

60
00:02:29,027 --> 00:02:31,502
how this research was carried out.

61
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:32,613
Come with me.

62
00:02:32,794 --> 00:02:34,195
Although all these studies

63
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:34,963
that were done

64
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,841
on home management of malaria

65
00:02:37,015 --> 00:02:38,441
were separately conducted,

66
00:02:38,637 --> 00:02:40,663
they have all the attributes

67
00:02:40,832 --> 00:02:43,045
of the implementation research

68
00:02:43,231 --> 00:02:45,156
and they had research teams

69
00:02:45,357 --> 00:02:47,546
that were multidisciplinary.

70
00:02:47,722 --> 00:02:51,397
Like in any implementation research,

71
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:52,610
the study objective

72
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,449
was clearly defined.

73
00:02:54,634 --> 00:02:55,884
In this case

74
00:02:56,073 --> 00:02:58,199
of home management of malaria,

75
00:02:58,367 --> 00:03:01,179
the study objective was to test

76
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,391
its strategy for prompt

77
00:03:04,573 --> 00:03:06,985
and appropriate home management

78
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,874
of fevers in children.

79
00:03:09,044 --> 00:03:10,881
The specific objectives

80
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:14,539
were also clearly stated. In this case

81
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:16,717
the operational feasibility

82
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:21,404
of delivery of pre-packaged drugs.

83
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,526
The drug of choice at that time

84
00:03:23,716 --> 00:03:25,280
was chloroquine.

85
00:03:25,463 --> 00:03:27,651
Another specific objective

86
00:03:27,826 --> 00:03:30,802
was a caregiver compliance

87
00:03:31,001 --> 00:03:32,951
with treatment resolutions.

88
00:03:33,141 --> 00:03:35,242
The research team were interested

89
00:03:35,413 --> 00:03:36,852
in assessing that.

90
00:03:37,228 --> 00:03:39,215
Other objective that they had,

91
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:40,387
which is typical

92
00:03:40,558 --> 00:03:42,621
of implementation research,

93
00:03:42,809 --> 00:03:45,708
is community attitude with respect

94
00:03:45,876 --> 00:03:48,789
to pre-packaged anti-malaria drugs

95
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:53,067
which would be new when tested.

96
00:03:53,506 --> 00:03:56,769
Overall, the proportion of children

97
00:03:58,077 --> 00:04:00,352
receiving prompt

98
00:04:00,533 --> 00:04:03,070
and appropriate treatment

99
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:05,568
for febrile illnesses

100
00:04:06,267 --> 00:04:08,505
would be measured.

101
00:04:08,714 --> 00:04:09,738
This one objective

102
00:04:09,919 --> 00:04:12,444
that all the teams working separately

103
00:04:12,624 --> 00:04:15,100
in different countries had.

104
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,042
The operational feasibility

105
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,930
of the strategy

106
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:21,799
for home management of malaria

107
00:04:21,972 --> 00:04:23,385
was reported.

108
00:04:23,587 --> 00:04:25,288
The researchers found that

109
00:04:25,517 --> 00:04:28,166
it was operationally feasible

110
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:29,952
and they give reasons for that.

111
00:04:30,122 --> 00:04:33,909
One, the methods of selection

112
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:37,605
of the committee distributors

113
00:04:37,792 --> 00:04:40,942
of every pre-packaged drugs

114
00:04:41,457 --> 00:04:43,732
was important aspect

115
00:04:43,908 --> 00:04:46,171
to the operational feasibility.

116
00:04:46,346 --> 00:04:47,758
They noted that

117
00:04:47,947 --> 00:04:49,747
the community members

118
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,268
that took part

119
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:55,415
in treating and managing malaria

120
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:57,634
at the comunity level

121
00:04:57,850 --> 00:05:00,225
saw it as a personal service

122
00:05:00,405 --> 00:05:01,780
to the community.

123
00:05:01,978 --> 00:05:03,016
They've saw themselves

124
00:05:03,206 --> 00:05:05,619
as particularly responsible

125
00:05:05,809 --> 00:05:08,159
and this was well-captured

126
00:05:08,366 --> 00:05:11,166
during the implementation research.

127
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,794
Implementation research

128
00:05:12,978 --> 00:05:16,691
will not let these types of reporting

129
00:05:16,862 --> 00:05:19,363
go by unnoticed.

130
00:05:19,547 --> 00:05:20,735
Community attitude

131
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:22,747
is one of the main objectives

132
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:24,459
of the study.

133
00:05:24,659 --> 00:05:27,110
The home management of malaria

134
00:05:27,278 --> 00:05:28,554
studies indicated

135
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:31,251
that the community are very happy

136
00:05:31,424 --> 00:05:34,088
with the pre-packaged drugs.

137
00:05:34,281 --> 00:05:36,957
One, the drugs were available

138
00:05:37,193 --> 00:05:40,669
when required within the community,

139
00:05:40,847 --> 00:05:42,397
on a very short distance.

140
00:05:42,577 --> 00:05:44,503
they didn't need to travel too far

141
00:05:44,685 --> 00:05:46,135
to access the drug.

142
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:48,777
So accessibility problem

143
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,709
was immediately solved.

144
00:05:51,211 --> 00:05:53,473
And the availability issue

145
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:54,929
was also solved.

146
00:05:55,108 --> 00:05:57,571
Unlike what they are used to;

147
00:05:57,751 --> 00:05:58,626
where they have to travel

148
00:05:58,803 --> 00:05:59,603
long distances

149
00:05:59,778 --> 00:06:01,803
to access drugs

150
00:06:01,992 --> 00:06:03,792
that one was removed.

151
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:07,078
Availability issue was also removed.

152
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:09,849
It was also found very simple

153
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:13,469
and culturally very acceptable

154
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,750
to them.

155
00:06:14,938 --> 00:06:16,388
The messages,

156
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:19,654
teaching them how to use the drugs

157
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,612
that were packaged and information,

158
00:06:21,806 --> 00:06:23,881
educational and communication messages,

159
00:06:24,078 --> 00:06:27,016
there were also very acceptable

160
00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:28,821
to the community.

161
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,287
On the other hand,

162
00:06:30,477 --> 00:06:31,864
the community distributors

163
00:06:32,052 --> 00:06:33,414
had to fill new forms

164
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:36,648
and often they are not very happy with that.

165
00:06:36,837 --> 00:06:38,912
Most community distributors

166
00:06:39,142 --> 00:06:42,168
and the players, the service provider

167
00:06:42,349 --> 00:06:43,686
at the community level

168
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:45,652
just want to get the job done.

169
00:06:45,824 --> 00:06:48,237
They want to give the intervention

170
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:49,494
to community member.

171
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:50,563
They required them

172
00:06:50,737 --> 00:06:51,975
as they were trained.

173
00:06:52,167 --> 00:06:54,142
The additional work

174
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:57,054
of filling out forms, pads

175
00:06:57,263 --> 00:07:00,837
are usually found very bothersome

176
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:01,865
for them

177
00:07:02,057 --> 00:07:03,544
and that usually

178
00:07:03,734 --> 00:07:05,959
is the reason most of them

179
00:07:06,138 --> 00:07:08,476
ask for incentives.

180
00:07:08,686 --> 00:07:09,985
In other 4 countries

181
00:07:10,156 --> 00:07:13,506
there was an appreciable improvement

182
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:16,741
in the proportion of children

183
00:07:16,922 --> 00:07:19,510
that actually receive prompt

184
00:07:19,682 --> 00:07:21,032
and appropriate treatment

185
00:07:21,217 --> 00:07:24,492
with the pre-packaged drug

186
00:07:24,775 --> 00:07:27,087
for the management of malaria,

187
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:31,762
a major objective of the study.

188
00:07:32,001 --> 00:07:34,151
As the result of these studies,

189
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:37,861
which were actually based on chloroquine,

190
00:07:38,049 --> 00:07:39,837
now extinct,

191
00:07:40,024 --> 00:07:42,874
home management of malaria

192
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:46,271
became a policy in many countries.

193
00:07:46,504 --> 00:07:48,368
Many countries have adopted

194
00:07:48,549 --> 00:07:50,049
the home management approach

195
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:51,604
and they are using it

196
00:07:51,777 --> 00:07:52,790
for Artemisinin-based

197
00:07:52,985 --> 00:07:57,324
combination therapy.

198
00:07:57,717 --> 00:07:59,754
Many manuals

199
00:07:59,943 --> 00:08:02,380
have been produced to support

200
00:08:02,564 --> 00:08:04,901
home management of malaria.

201
00:08:05,111 --> 00:08:06,548
This demonstrates

202
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,582
how implementation research

203
00:08:09,799 --> 00:08:14,137
moves from the concept of identifying

204
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:16,309
the implementation problem

205
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:19,529
using research to solve that problem

206
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:22,746
and ensuring that they're some uptake

207
00:08:22,942 --> 00:08:26,242
of the findings into policy

208
00:08:26,547 --> 00:08:29,010
which is use to improve

209
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:31,690
the quality of implementation

210
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:34,610
by removing the initial hindrance

211
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:39,209
to the use of efficacious interventions.

212
00:08:39,514 --> 00:08:43,102
You will recall that the study

213
00:08:43,278 --> 00:08:47,303
started as a strategy

214
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:51,990
for improving the uptake

215
00:08:52,179 --> 00:08:53,728
of chloroquine

216
00:08:53,914 --> 00:08:57,653
using pre-packaged chloroquine medicines.

217
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,375
Soon after this was proven

218
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:03,026
to be feasible,

219
00:09:03,187 --> 00:09:04,800
operationally feasible,

220
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:07,132
acceptable at the community level

221
00:09:07,339 --> 00:09:10,014
and scaling up has been done.

222
00:09:10,198 --> 00:09:13,185
There was a change from chloroquine

223
00:09:13,404 --> 00:09:15,854
to Artemisinin combination therapy;

224
00:09:16,045 --> 00:09:16,870
a new drug.

225
00:09:18,093 --> 00:09:20,918
So implementation research

226
00:09:21,114 --> 00:09:23,102
had to come in as well

227
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:24,934
and implementation research

228
00:09:25,127 --> 00:09:28,090
was used to test.

229
00:09:28,323 --> 00:09:30,297
Will the same strategy

230
00:09:30,498 --> 00:09:32,685
that was used for chloroquine

231
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:35,636
be feasible, acceptable

232
00:09:35,857 --> 00:09:38,082
and will it be effective

233
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,720
for Artemisinin combination therapy?

234
00:09:42,252 --> 00:09:44,715
That was proven to be yes,

235
00:09:44,893 --> 00:09:47,106
it was feasible.

236
00:09:47,734 --> 00:09:50,459
The excitement following that,

237
00:09:50,752 --> 00:09:52,727
led to:

238
00:09:54,769 --> 00:09:56,907
could we use the same strategy

239
00:09:57,172 --> 00:10:00,084
of home and community

240
00:10:00,262 --> 00:10:02,011
management strategy?

241
00:10:02,183 --> 00:10:05,946
could we use it for identifying

242
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:09,803
and managing pneumonia,

243
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,010
which is another childhood illness?

244
00:10:15,103 --> 00:10:18,415
So implementation research was used

245
00:10:18,626 --> 00:10:20,050
to test that.

246
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,273
And lastly,

247
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:25,988
rapid diagnostic test kit

248
00:10:26,746 --> 00:10:28,358
were incorporated

249
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,039
to the management of malaria.

250
00:10:31,248 --> 00:10:33,086
with it, that could be

251
00:10:33,282 --> 00:10:36,208
evidence-based malarial management;

252
00:10:37,287 --> 00:10:39,112
which use to be done

253
00:10:39,297 --> 00:10:40,759
in the healthcare facility.

254
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:42,182
And the question was,

255
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:44,715
could community members

256
00:10:44,902 --> 00:10:48,002
use the rapid diagnostic test kit

257
00:10:49,501 --> 00:10:54,964
to identify malaria

258
00:10:55,346 --> 00:10:57,733
and then be able to refer

259
00:10:57,901 --> 00:10:59,888
non-malaria cases

260
00:11:00,063 --> 00:11:01,562
to the health facility?

261
00:11:01,748 --> 00:11:06,297
It was implementation research

262
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:08,189
that was called upon

263
00:11:08,379 --> 00:11:10,653
to answer that question.

264
00:11:10,869 --> 00:11:15,032
So the evolution has systematically

265
00:11:15,237 --> 00:11:18,387
moved from pre-packaged chloroquine

266
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:20,620
to the use

267
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:23,442
of rapid diagnostic test kit

268
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:26,909
for evidence-based fever management.

269
00:11:27,832 --> 00:11:31,094
That’s typical of implementation research

270
00:11:31,271 --> 00:11:33,070
always evolving.

271
00:11:33,273 --> 00:11:34,761
Thank you for listening.

272
00:11:34,945 --> 00:11:36,581
We go to the next one,

273
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:39,812
where we will be discussing another

274
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:43,220
implementation research example

275
00:11:43,433 --> 00:11:48,058
with community-directed intervention

276
00:11:48,263 --> 00:11:49,662
Thank you for listening

277
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:51,186
but don't go away,

278
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:52,570
let's go

279
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:55,739
to community-directed intervention.

280
00:11:55,989 --> 00:11:58,164
Thank you.
