00:00:04,134 --> 00:00:08,684
Hi, I'm Pascal Allotey,
professor of public health

2
00:00:08,813 --> 00:00:12,238
at the Jeffrey Cheah School of
Medicine and Health Sciences

3
00:00:12,342 --> 00:00:14,680
Monash University Malaysia.

4
00:00:14,782 --> 00:00:20,770
Welcome to this Massive Online Open
Course on implementation research.

5
00:00:20,942 --> 00:00:24,642
There is significant financial
investment in the development of

6
00:00:24,813 --> 00:00:28,801
tools and interventions to tackle
some of the major public health

7
00:00:28,893 --> 00:00:32,905
challenges, particularly
in diseases of poverty,

8
00:00:33,053 --> 00:00:36,753
There are also funding schemes
to address grand challenges of our

9
00:00:36,852 --> 00:00:42,089
time towards vaccine development and
other innovations that will tackle

10
00:00:42,194 --> 00:00:44,806
the causes of diseases
and ill health.

11
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,525
But an ongoing challenge for which
the current evidence base remains thin,

12
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:55,133
is how to ensure that these
solutions, tools, interventions, etc.

13
00:00:55,253 --> 00:00:59,253
get to the people who need
them and are used in a manner

14
00:00:59,414 --> 00:01:02,801
that results in the outcome
for which they were intended.

15
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:06,042
In the absence of effective
implementation strategies,

16
00:01:06,141 --> 00:01:10,491
the usefulness of otherwise
effective solutions is severely

17
00:01:10,566 --> 00:01:15,328
curtailed, and yet the importance
of implementation research is often

18
00:01:15,437 --> 00:01:19,337
underestimated, and it is
not considered a core part

19
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:21,172
of the research pipeline.

20
00:01:21,308 --> 00:01:26,520
This Massive Online Open Course,
or MOOC, on implementation

21
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:31,581
research provides an ideal
opportunity for you to come to grips

22
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:35,754
with implementation research
with the expectation that by the end

23
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:38,839
of the course, you will
be able to design your own

24
00:01:38,936 --> 00:01:43,511
implementation research projects,
critically evaluate and use

25
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:47,668
the evidence produced by other
implementation research projects,

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,685
commission robustly designed
implementation research projects

27
00:01:52,797 --> 00:01:57,422
and all of this with the ultimate
goal of enhancing the evidence

28
00:01:57,519 --> 00:02:01,906
base of effective ways to improve
the heath of the populations

29
00:02:02,015 --> 00:02:03,115
we serve.

30
00:02:03,179 --> 00:02:07,829
The first step for you is to take
the brief introduction to using

31
00:02:07,922 --> 00:02:09,447
the MOOC platform.

32
00:02:09,555 --> 00:02:14,267
This introduces you on how to access
the content and resources available

33
00:02:14,412 --> 00:02:19,712
on the platform, how to enroll,
how to take various assessments

34
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:23,366
and how to get the most out
of the learning opportunities

35
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:27,080
through discussion fora with
others taking the course.

36
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:30,962
Once this is done, you will
have access to some of the leading

37
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,232
experts from around the world,
who will take you step by step

38
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:39,450
through the core concepts in
implementation research

39
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:44,845
identifying the challenges of
various contexts, how to assess

40
00:02:44,952 --> 00:02:48,464
the appropriateness
of existing strategies

41
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:53,132
how to develop new innovations
and strategies by working with

42
00:02:53,233 --> 00:02:58,083
communities and stakeholders,
specifying your implementation

43
00:02:58,195 --> 00:03:03,632
research question, operationalising
your variables, and designing

44
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:06,348
rigorous research projects.

45
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:10,508
You'll also learn how to identify
your implementation research

46
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:14,141
outcomes and evaluate
the effectiveness of your

47
00:03:14,256 --> 00:03:17,094
implementation research strategy.

48
00:03:17,215 --> 00:03:22,852
Finally you will learn how to plan
the scale-up of your intervention

49
00:03:22,926 --> 00:03:26,476
given a robust
implementation strategy.

50
00:03:27,311 --> 00:03:31,411
Of course, the research pipeline
does not end there and you'll need

51
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:36,152
to have established the mechanisms
for ongoing monitoring to determine

52
00:03:36,254 --> 00:03:39,654
when your intervention is
sustained within the population

53
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:44,617
or where appropriate when
the disease is eliminated.

54
00:03:44,765 --> 00:03:47,915
The course is enriched
by several case studies of

55
00:03:47,997 --> 00:03:53,959
projects that have succeeded and
also examples of failures and why.

56
00:03:54,331 --> 00:03:58,281
You will also have the opportunity
to hear from senior level policy

57
00:03:58,354 --> 00:04:01,829
makers at the national
and international level.

58
00:04:02,037 --> 00:04:05,037
And critically the materials have
been put together by several

59
00:04:06,735 --> 00:04:09,323
eminent people in the field.

60
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:13,799
Professor Oladele Akogun,
and professor Hans Remme

61
00:04:13,915 --> 00:04:16,565
take you through module one.

62
00:04:16,643 --> 00:04:20,493
Professor William Brieger,
and professor Uche Amazigo

63
00:04:20,577 --> 00:04:24,377
run through module two,
and explain how to address

64
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:29,780
the challenges of understanding
and working within diverse contexts.

65
00:04:29,933 --> 00:04:35,258
Professor Maria Rosário Martins,
doctor Neal Alexander

66
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:40,009
and doctor Jorge Arroz will
take you through module three

67
00:04:40,104 --> 00:04:43,629
on the design of implementation
strategies and research

68
00:04:43,737 --> 00:04:48,437
approaches required to ensure
robust evidence to justify

69
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,582
the implementation approach.

70
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:54,408
In module four, doctor
Olakunle Alonge

71
00:04:54,499 --> 00:04:58,836
and doctor Vivian Go provide
a detailed explanation of

72
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:03,873
how to evaluate implementation
research  by clearly articulating

73
00:05:04,004 --> 00:05:07,316
appropriate implementation
research outcomes.

74
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:11,932
And finally in module five,
doctor Paul Milligan and doctor

75
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:16,746
Corine Merle, bring together
the core issues across the four

76
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:21,041
modules and demonstrate how
the principles work in practice

77
00:05:21,223 --> 00:05:24,223
and support scaling
up of interventions.

78
00:05:24,393 --> 00:05:28,055
Your learning will be supported
through informative and summative

79
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:33,023
assessments and opportunities
to engage with your cohort through

80
00:05:33,152 --> 00:05:34,477
discussion forum.

81
00:05:34,693 --> 00:05:39,718
There are also a wide range of
resources provided for you as

82
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:44,220
supplementary and reference text for
the course and for your future work

83
00:05:44,296 --> 00:05:46,808
as implementation researchers.

84
00:05:46,924 --> 00:05:52,399
Many of these have been compiled
or commissioned by TDR.

85
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:58,550
The project of this MOOC involved
a large team of experts, credited in the

86
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:03,435
and was coordinated
by professor Pascal Launois

87
00:06:03,542 --> 00:06:06,142
and Edith Certain.

88
00:06:06,248 --> 00:06:10,411
We sincerely hope you enjoy
the course and take some time

89
00:06:10,541 --> 00:06:15,891
when it's over to let us know what
worked and what can be done better.

90
00:06:16,021 --> 00:06:20,608
And we look forward to the potential
to work with you on your

91
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:25,097
implementation research projects
once the course is completed.

92
00:06:25,219 --> 00:06:27,832
Thank you.
