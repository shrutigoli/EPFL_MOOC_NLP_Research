00:00:04,852 --> 00:00:07,227
Hello. I'm Hans Remme

2
00:00:07,457 --> 00:00:09,932
and I'm taking you
through this final chapter

3
00:00:10,003 --> 00:00:13,428
of concepts and scope of
implementation research.

4
00:00:13,539 --> 00:00:16,539
Professor Akogun has shown
you several examples

5
00:00:16,642 --> 00:00:21,004
of implementation problems,
and implementation research projects.

6
00:00:21,305 --> 00:00:24,868
and what we'll do now is take a step
back and take a more theoretical

7
00:00:24,985 --> 00:00:27,510
look at implementation research.

8
00:00:28,304 --> 00:00:31,329
We'll talk about what
implementation is,

9
00:00:31,445 --> 00:00:34,207
definitions of
implementation research,

10
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,310
different phases in
implementations project,

11
00:00:37,397 --> 00:00:39,872
how implementation
research fits in overall

12
00:00:39,987 --> 00:00:44,925
research landscape, and finally
the importance and possible impact

13
00:00:45,015 --> 00:00:48,065
in implementation research
in the area of health.

14
00:00:48,179 --> 00:00:49,729
So to start, I'd like to take you

15
00:00:49,793 --> 00:00:53,006
back to a diagram
the professor Alottey showed

16
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:55,146
at the beginning of the course.

17
00:00:55,263 --> 00:00:58,763
This is a simple diagram
of the basic concept

18
00:00:58,871 --> 00:01:00,921
of implementation research

19
00:01:01,018 --> 00:01:05,406
showing a significant health problem
and efficacious intervention that

20
00:01:05,484 --> 00:01:07,884
could have a major impact
on the health problem

21
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:11,178
but doesn't, because of
implementation problems.

22
00:01:11,748 --> 00:01:15,461
Implementation research
focuses on those problems;

23
00:01:15,553 --> 00:01:19,415
not on the intervention,
not on the health problem

24
00:01:19,594 --> 00:01:24,232
but trying to tackle the problem
that the intervention doesn't

25
00:01:24,377 --> 00:01:27,865
reach the health problem and
doesn't have the desired impact.

26
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:32,950
Implementation research tries to
understand the problem,

27
00:01:33,083 --> 00:01:37,245
the reasons for it and particularly
trying to develop a solution

28
00:01:37,308 --> 00:01:39,533
that will overcome the problem.

29
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:42,791
That is the major focus of
implementation research

30
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:47,567
developing effective solutions
for implementation problems.

31
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:51,384
So let's now try to put
the diagram into words.

32
00:01:51,449 --> 00:01:56,261
Implementation research addresses
health interventions, proven health

33
00:01:56,378 --> 00:01:59,941
interventions that do not have
the expected impact because of

34
00:02:00,006 --> 00:02:03,818
implementation problems; and
we can differentiate two types

35
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,554
of interventions.

36
00:02:05,637 --> 00:02:08,637
Interventions that have been
on a long way, a long time around

37
00:02:08,696 --> 00:02:10,508
and for which
the implementation problem

38
00:02:10,627 --> 00:02:12,241
has been around
for a long time.

39
00:02:12,339 --> 00:02:14,952
they maybe increasingly being
tackled by implementations

40
00:02:15,074 --> 00:02:18,987
research and an example for that
is for malaria; what professor Akogun showed

41
00:02:19,075 --> 00:02:23,500
The example of malaria,
where the availability of

42
00:02:23,586 --> 00:02:25,886
anti-malarials, effective
anti-malarials, did not prevent

43
00:02:25,993 --> 00:02:28,093
hundreds of thousands
children to die.

44
00:02:28,217 --> 00:02:31,179
because of malaria, because
they did not get the adequate

45
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:33,022
treatment in time

46
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,620
a major implementation problem,
that was tackled by the home

47
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:39,273
management of malaria strategy.

48
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:43,202
And there are interventions which
are new, just coming down of

49
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:47,765
the research pipeline, but it can
already be anticipated that it will be

50
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:50,101
major implementation challenges.

51
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:54,645
For instance, ivermectin became
available for Onchocerciasis.

52
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:58,568
There was no intervention for most
of Africa before that and suddenly

53
00:02:58,667 --> 00:03:03,504
there was an opportunity
and need to cover and treat

54
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:06,965
a hundred and sixty million people
all over Africa in very difficult

55
00:03:07,037 --> 00:03:09,849
situations with poor
functioning health systems.

56
00:03:09,968 --> 00:03:13,406
How to do that, how to ensure
sustained annual treatment?

57
00:03:13,559 --> 00:03:16,721
Implementation just came in,
and you know the results of

58
00:03:16,817 --> 00:03:20,542
the community-directed treatment,
strategy was very effective.

59
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:24,691
Another example was
shown for Tunisia

60
00:03:24,815 --> 00:03:27,902
contains leishmaniasis;
where mechanical plowing

61
00:03:27,996 --> 00:03:30,996
was effective in removing
the intermediate host in

62
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,667
the transmission cycle.

63
00:03:32,774 --> 00:03:40,887
But, scaling up mechanical plowing
ran into  multisectoral

64
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:43,715
challenges.

65
00:03:43,888 --> 00:03:48,863
Communities, health systems,
ministries, everybody had

66
00:03:48,986 --> 00:03:52,811
obstacles and problems; so
implementation research

67
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:57,686
was critically needed to see how to
tackle this systematically so that

68
00:03:57,813 --> 00:04:00,500
intervention could be up-scaled.

69
00:04:01,348 --> 00:04:05,723
So that's what implementation
research does, going in

70
00:04:05,839 --> 00:04:09,827
trying to identify and investigate
these problems that prevent

71
00:04:09,894 --> 00:04:12,694
effective implementation,
so detailed research

72
00:04:12,823 --> 00:04:18,573
to study  how important problems are,
and what really causes them,

73
00:04:18,686 --> 00:04:21,936
and try to develop and test
implementation strategies

74
00:04:22,015 --> 00:04:25,840
that provide solutions to these
implementation problems.

75
00:04:26,618 --> 00:04:32,431
As we said before, the ultimate
aim, the focus of IR, is to develop

76
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:37,637
evidence-based solutions
that can be applied at scale.

77
00:04:37,788 --> 00:04:40,000
In implementing research,

78
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:43,327
three key phases can
be distinguished.

79
00:04:43,543 --> 00:04:47,793
The first phase is about
defining that implementation

80
00:04:47,873 --> 00:04:52,048
problem, understanding
it better, investigating it

81
00:04:52,152 --> 00:04:55,552
and taking into account
the specific local settings

82
00:04:55,678 --> 00:04:57,328
and context.

83
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:03,488
Very often, implementation
problems are very setting specific

84
00:05:03,735 --> 00:05:08,223
say for, malaria, had all these
of directly being close to home.

85
00:05:08,335 --> 00:05:11,335
well that depends on how
vital and how effective

86
00:05:11,493 --> 00:05:14,493
the local health system is
and how close it gets to the home,

87
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:20,340
Their issues of perception of
malaria and perception of

88
00:05:20,465 --> 00:05:23,303
the effectiveness of drugs
or local treatments  can

89
00:05:23,369 --> 00:05:25,594
highly vary between areas,
and so on.

90
00:05:25,688 --> 00:05:28,688
So you have to understand and
notice different context

91
00:05:28,811 --> 00:05:33,099
and also, - that's the second
major point in this phase -

92
00:05:33,557 --> 00:05:35,532
understand the reasons
of the problem.

93
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,468
Why do we have it in
this particular case?

94
00:05:38,586 --> 00:05:42,361
And generate information
on possible solutions.

95
00:05:42,697 --> 00:05:45,747
That's easily said that done.
In the beginning, we don't know

96
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:50,258
what solutions  we are looking for so
that will require some exploratory

97
00:05:50,354 --> 00:05:51,792
research.

98
00:05:51,987 --> 00:05:55,412
Module two of this course,
we'll discuss in further detail

99
00:05:55,502 --> 00:05:59,214
the issue of many various
settings of implementation

100
00:05:59,313 --> 00:06:03,263
research and how to identify
the implementation problems

101
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,035
and generate information
on possible solutions.

102
00:06:07,568 --> 00:06:10,205
The second phase,
and a very difficult

103
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:15,402
and important one, is to design
implementation strategies.

104
00:06:15,521 --> 00:06:20,383
This is usually done by
brainstorming based on

105
00:06:20,509 --> 00:06:24,596
evidence and information collected
in the research in the phase one

106
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:28,737
of the study.
all the data of the problem and

107
00:06:28,831 --> 00:06:32,206
all relevant related factors
and possible solutions

108
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:35,178
where ideas about solutions,
emerging from the date collected

109
00:06:35,295 --> 00:06:38,983
at the phase one; but at the same
time also, they carefully review

110
00:06:39,068 --> 00:06:40,755
the scientific literature.

111
00:06:40,847 --> 00:06:44,247
Whenever the first to look
into an issue with a lot of

112
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,013
relevant information
in the literature,

113
00:06:46,146 --> 00:06:49,871
sometimes already ready
implementation strategies

114
00:06:49,973 --> 00:06:54,373
being proposed, or sometimes
ideas which may lead to idea,

115
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:58,553
suggestions how to tackle it
in this particular situation.

116
00:06:58,702 --> 00:07:01,152
And based on that,
you're trying to design

117
00:07:01,261 --> 00:07:05,786
in improved implementation strategy
based on what you have learned

118
00:07:05,884 --> 00:07:11,397
from the data and what you think
may work in that specific situation;

119
00:07:11,991 --> 00:07:16,416
strategies that have potential
to overcome the implementation

120
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:18,952
problem in this type of settings.

121
00:07:19,046 --> 00:07:22,721
Module three of this course
on implementations research;

122
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:26,429
we'll go in greater detail about
the question of defining

123
00:07:26,526 --> 00:07:30,126
research questions and
developing implementation strategies

124
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:34,118
and thus, indication  of the type of
research methodologies that

125
00:07:34,209 --> 00:07:35,347
should be applied.

126
00:07:35,433 --> 00:07:39,433
Once and potentially new and more
effective strategy has been

127
00:07:39,532 --> 00:07:43,220
developed, it will be
tested in real life settings.

128
00:07:43,326 --> 00:07:47,113
That is often a very complex
large scale research because

129
00:07:47,228 --> 00:07:50,878
of the real life setting means
really the whole social context

130
00:07:50,975 --> 00:07:55,913
in different areas. and we're then
going to look specifically what

131
00:07:56,005 --> 00:08:00,193
this new intervention does in
terms of achieving; what we call

132
00:08:00,268 --> 00:08:02,893
implementation research outcomes.

133
00:08:03,004 --> 00:08:07,379
We want to asses the effectiveness
of the implementation in achieving

134
00:08:07,437 --> 00:08:11,537
and solution to the implementation
problem, removing the implementation

135
00:08:11,604 --> 00:08:15,741
problem so that intervention
can reach the health problem.

136
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:19,245
We're not really immediately
dropping here about effect on

137
00:08:19,367 --> 00:08:22,780
the disease; it is getting
intervention to the disease.

138
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:25,885
getting things implemented,
that's the essential focus of

139
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:27,551
implementation research.

140
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:30,643
And then, in the end we compare
the effectiveness of what we have

141
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:35,141
tried out, a new proposed strategy
and the old one. and based on those

142
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:38,027
conclusions, we will know if
we can recommend to

143
00:08:38,139 --> 00:08:41,151
implement a large scale
implication of this strategy.

144
00:08:41,237 --> 00:08:43,974
Module four of this course in
implementation research

145
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:49,115
will go into detail on the issue of
implementation research outcomes

146
00:08:49,218 --> 00:08:50,818
and how to measure them.

147
00:08:50,926 --> 00:08:53,638
Now that we have defined what
the implementation research is,

148
00:08:53,738 --> 00:08:57,088
let's see how it fits in
the overall research landscape

149
00:08:57,143 --> 00:09:02,206
and specifically in the research
pipeline for new interventions.

150
00:09:02,898 --> 00:09:07,348
Implementation research is preceded
by intervention research; this is to

151
00:09:07,407 --> 00:09:12,532
develop and test efficacious
interventions. it's testing is usually

152
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:16,602
done in very controlled trials
and randomized control trials.

153
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:21,591
It is different from implementation
research because it's really about

154
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:26,122
focusing on the intervention,
not orient on the implementation.

155
00:09:26,214 --> 00:09:29,502
but intervention research and
implementation research are

156
00:09:29,611 --> 00:09:33,461
very often confused. I hope you
won't confuse any more

157
00:09:33,548 --> 00:09:35,648
after this course.

158
00:09:35,754 --> 00:09:40,092
Following implementation research
we have a type of research we call

159
00:09:40,192 --> 00:09:45,330
effectiveness research to assess
the effects, the impact of

160
00:09:45,432 --> 00:09:49,970
the disease, the intervention on
the disease in question and

161
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:51,801
the real life conditions.

162
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:56,362
Now, the implementation research
is about getting implementation

163
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:59,460
and intervention
implemented in real life.

164
00:10:00,362 --> 00:10:03,062
Implementation research and
effectiveness research are very

165
00:10:03,163 --> 00:10:05,413
closely associated;

166
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:09,590
and often people
want to combine them

167
00:10:09,846 --> 00:10:12,846
in one research project.

168
00:10:13,109 --> 00:10:17,109
Sometimes it can be done,
sometimes it's not a good idea

169
00:10:17,282 --> 00:10:20,557
because the methodology
required and the type of

170
00:10:20,663 --> 00:10:25,725
research and research scope may be
very different between those two.

171
00:10:25,829 --> 00:10:30,516
However, if you do it, be careful
and be always clear that you have

172
00:10:30,613 --> 00:10:35,063
two different research methodologies
and research objectives, and don't

173
00:10:35,154 --> 00:10:37,879
mix the two up.

174
00:10:38,225 --> 00:10:41,112
At the same level of implementation
research, we have other research

175
00:10:41,204 --> 00:10:43,329
areas also concerned with

176
00:10:43,466 --> 00:10:46,004
implementation
to some extent.

177
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:49,151
Operational research solving
operational problems of

178
00:10:49,219 --> 00:10:52,044
local health problems
very focused.

179
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:55,554
And health system research
looking at performance at

180
00:10:55,668 --> 00:10:57,843
the health system as a whole.

181
00:10:57,917 --> 00:11:00,505
Wider system focus.

182
00:11:00,609 --> 00:11:02,959
The borders between those
different areas are not clearly

183
00:11:03,045 --> 00:11:08,657
defined; there's a lot of overlap.
it doesn't matter as long. if you do

184
00:11:08,757 --> 00:11:11,994
any of this research, be clear what
your objective is and what you're

185
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,573
trying to achieve.

186
00:11:13,667 --> 00:11:16,329
Then there is a number
of key characteristics of IR

187
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:17,704
that I would like to discuss.

188
00:11:17,767 --> 00:11:21,317
First of all, IR is complex.

189
00:11:22,597 --> 00:11:26,597
And complexity at different levels,
first of all the problems that we're

190
00:11:26,695 --> 00:11:29,057
are dealing with tend to be complex

191
00:11:29,141 --> 00:11:31,954
because they're
multi-factorial problems.

192
00:11:32,047 --> 00:11:35,047
there are all different reasons
why something doesn't work

193
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,812
like for malaria, or maybe it is
that a whole local health systems

194
00:11:38,906 --> 00:11:42,619
not functioning, or people have
no belief locally in the new drugs

195
00:11:42,724 --> 00:11:47,511
or they give preference
to traditional medicine

196
00:11:47,604 --> 00:11:51,942
approaches,  or there are some major
problem locally of understanding of

197
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,417
what causes malaria and
what you can do about it.

198
00:11:55,396 --> 00:11:59,896
So, the many, many factors,
and therefore a very complex

199
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:01,961
kind of research is required.

200
00:12:03,332 --> 00:12:05,694
Therefore, we bring in
multi-disciplinary teams.

201
00:12:05,783 --> 00:12:07,896
we need to look at all
the different aspects

202
00:12:07,971 --> 00:12:10,971
of the problem and
the possible solutions.

203
00:12:11,176 --> 00:12:18,151
And so for the CDI study, there was
a big group of epidemiologists,

204
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,738
social behavioral scientists,
health economists

205
00:12:20,818 --> 00:12:22,956
statisticians and other managers

206
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:27,073
and these were all required
to answer the overall question,

207
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:32,640
complex question of CDI.

208
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:37,165
Multi-sectorial research, we've seen
example in Tunisia, and of course

209
00:12:37,293 --> 00:12:40,293
come back in many of the other
studies that we were addressing.

210
00:12:41,509 --> 00:12:45,209
Others are multi-center
and multi-country studies.

211
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:48,535
the aim in implementation research

212
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:55,202
is to develop solutions that can be
applied at scale, but different

213
00:12:55,301 --> 00:13:00,914
situations have different types
of modifications of the problem

214
00:13:01,015 --> 00:13:04,015
so there's often a question,
can we really scale this up?

215
00:13:04,516 --> 00:13:07,354
That's why multi-center studies are
important that you do the same

216
00:13:07,488 --> 00:13:13,213
study in different places with
quite different local settings

217
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,909
and conditions.

218
00:13:16,024 --> 00:13:18,724
and if you get generally
the same answer coming back

219
00:13:18,803 --> 00:13:23,240
we have more confidence that your
intervention is really applicable

220
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:24,749
over wider scale.

221
00:13:24,846 --> 00:13:27,071
On the other hand, if different
variations come up

222
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:31,105
which are fundamentally important,
and in some places, prevent

223
00:13:31,174 --> 00:13:33,786
the achievement of
the implementation

224
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:36,277
then your strategy
is not up-scalable

225
00:13:36,392 --> 00:13:39,392
and you need adaptations
to be developed for different areas.

226
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:44,253
So, to get the scale,
multi-center studies

227
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,511
are very important.

228
00:13:47,347 --> 00:13:51,610
Focus, as we said it before,
is about its research.

229
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:55,736
We're trying to get new knowledge
and new solutions. research is

230
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:58,342
about innovation and that's
certainly what implementations

231
00:13:58,409 --> 00:13:59,971
is also about.

232
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:03,600
It's not routine monitoring
and evaluation; this is very

233
00:14:03,687 --> 00:14:05,700
important for all health programs,

234
00:14:05,792 --> 00:14:07,655
but that's not research.

235
00:14:07,785 --> 00:14:11,935
The main aim of implementation
research is to find an improvement

236
00:14:12,024 --> 00:14:14,712
and that requires innovation.

237
00:14:15,536 --> 00:14:18,024
For scale-up,
already mentioned to it

238
00:14:18,127 --> 00:14:22,639
and of course, sustainability is
another major issue with

239
00:14:22,741 --> 00:14:27,216
implementation research focuses on,
because no use to solve a problem

240
00:14:27,332 --> 00:14:29,057
if it comes back after
two years time.

241
00:14:29,164 --> 00:14:31,977
We need sustainable solutions.

242
00:14:32,947 --> 00:14:36,297
The third "multi" is
the actors involved.

243
00:14:36,414 --> 00:14:39,614
Many different actors play a role
in implementation research.

244
00:14:39,692 --> 00:14:43,942
they are critical for it and
particularly highlight

245
00:14:44,024 --> 00:14:47,211
the importance of involving
the ministry of health,

246
00:14:47,254 --> 00:14:50,342
personnel and disease
control managers

247
00:14:50,468 --> 00:14:53,868
already up front in the study
in the defining of the research

248
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:55,988
question and the design
of the study.

249
00:14:56,087 --> 00:14:59,749
It's critically important that their
concerns are taken into account

250
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:02,333
and that they stay a part
of process to make sure

251
00:15:02,444 --> 00:15:06,269
whatever the research does
provides answers to what they need,

252
00:15:06,351 --> 00:15:07,989
provides the information they need

253
00:15:08,069 --> 00:15:12,231
so that they can implement
the solution and bring it to scale.

254
00:15:12,315 --> 00:15:15,440
Endemic country researches,
especially in this research,

255
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:17,541
they should play a lead role.

256
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,639
They understand the local
situation they understand how

257
00:15:21,245 --> 00:15:25,783
populations will react, and how
health systems and different levels

258
00:15:25,867 --> 00:15:30,442
of the community will respond to
different possible approaches

259
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:32,516
and therefore are critical in

260
00:15:32,567 --> 00:15:34,304
the interpretation
of different results.

261
00:15:34,410 --> 00:15:37,672
but also in the best position to
take the research findings back

262
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,012
and communicate this
to the different partners

263
00:15:41,132 --> 00:15:43,382
and ministries of health
and other decision makers

264
00:15:43,465 --> 00:15:45,403
for large scale impact.

265
00:15:45,463 --> 00:15:47,551
And finally, we have seen it
in the several examples,

266
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:49,731
we've shown ownership
of the end-users.

267
00:15:49,827 --> 00:15:52,140
and what in those studies,
we've shown you the examples of

268
00:15:52,265 --> 00:15:55,015
what's particularly important was
the community. they were the key

269
00:15:55,104 --> 00:15:59,054
powers to finally implement
a solution; so they were critical

270
00:15:59,162 --> 00:16:01,124
players in this whole process.

271
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:04,312
There is remaining challenges in
implementation research

272
00:16:04,407 --> 00:16:09,007
and some major ones
are that the IR is new.

273
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,553
People are not familiar with it,
in fact there's a lot of confusion

274
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:15,590
about what the implementation
research is, and that's one of

275
00:16:15,684 --> 00:16:18,684
the reasons why we're
having this course.

276
00:16:19,831 --> 00:16:27,644
It's also not recognized often in
the disease control environment.

277
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,978
People might say:
"Well, we have to do things."

278
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:32,599
"We have to implement it, we need
funding, we need more vehicles."

279
00:16:32,687 --> 00:16:34,749
"That's our issue,
not more research."

280
00:16:34,811 --> 00:16:38,961
So, there's some confliction
to be done up front to

281
00:16:39,097 --> 00:16:42,697
make clear what contribution of
implementation research can be.

282
00:16:42,819 --> 00:16:45,919
We see clearly that in areas where
implementation research has worked

283
00:16:46,012 --> 00:16:50,775
and has produced effective results,
disease control managers and health

284
00:16:50,893 --> 00:16:53,968
ministry of health staff become
much more interested

285
00:16:54,074 --> 00:16:57,074
because they can see they
can benefit for their work.

286
00:16:57,672 --> 00:17:01,272
Then we have an issue, where you
do the research and implement

287
00:17:01,379 --> 00:17:06,692
implementation research, of keeping
research and implementation separate.

288
00:17:07,467 --> 00:17:11,205
Testing a new implementation
strategy in real life setting

289
00:17:11,423 --> 00:17:17,460
is complex and requires a lot
of support to get it going.

290
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:22,179
But we must make sure that there's
no interference with our ability to

291
00:17:22,258 --> 00:17:26,008
assess how this intervention
would work in real life without

292
00:17:26,134 --> 00:17:27,821
researchers being around.

293
00:17:27,929 --> 00:17:31,404
So we need an arm length distance
all the time between the research

294
00:17:31,494 --> 00:17:35,182
activities , the evaluation
activities, and what would not be

295
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:39,493
otherwise available in the real
life implication in the future.

296
00:17:40,690 --> 00:17:45,902
Multi-factorial processes, keeping
complex multi-disciplinary research

297
00:17:45,993 --> 00:17:48,030
focused and manageable.

298
00:17:48,238 --> 00:17:51,350
I think by now, we got the message
that implementation research

299
00:17:51,475 --> 00:17:55,638
can be highly complex. and since we
are addressing so many different

300
00:17:55,713 --> 00:17:58,913
factors and settings and so on,
there's a tendency where you

301
00:17:59,014 --> 00:18:02,014
start doing the studies
to go into everything,

302
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:05,846
to try to study everything and
try to study all possible issues

303
00:18:05,941 --> 00:18:10,366
that could be related and you may
soon drift off in all directions and

304
00:18:10,457 --> 00:18:11,932
become not manageable any more.

305
00:18:12,032 --> 00:18:16,932
Critical way for running an IR
project is to have a very well

306
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:22,279
defined, very clear objective
and always try to focus on that

307
00:18:22,368 --> 00:18:25,368
and limit your activities to that.

308
00:18:25,591 --> 00:18:28,591
Collect data which can
contribute to the question.

309
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:33,757
don't go beyond that because
you just get a massive amount

310
00:18:33,876 --> 00:18:37,813
of information which will decrease
your ability to understand what

311
00:18:37,906 --> 00:18:40,906
really is happening
and what you need to do.

312
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:45,375
Generalizeable solutions.

313
00:18:45,464 --> 00:18:48,852
We want to stay adaptable to local
circumstances, and I've discussed

314
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:53,795
this now, but it's clearly a major
challenge in implementation

315
00:18:53,885 --> 00:18:56,885
research, and we have
to be creative to do that.

316
00:18:57,515 --> 00:19:02,615
And finally, we said we want to go
beyond just evaluation; we are doing

317
00:19:02,738 --> 00:19:05,738
research about new solutions.

318
00:19:05,969 --> 00:19:08,869
Finally, something about
the importance of

319
00:19:08,984 --> 00:19:10,772
implementation research.

320
00:19:10,856 --> 00:19:13,968
The very obvious and immediate
benefit is of course overcoming

321
00:19:14,055 --> 00:19:18,680
the bottleneck; the implementation
bottleneck; so that we can have

322
00:19:18,772 --> 00:19:20,484
a major health impact that

323
00:19:20,575 --> 00:19:22,775
the intervention possibly
could achieve.

324
00:19:22,856 --> 00:19:25,856
So immediate effect of
implementation research,

325
00:19:25,969 --> 00:19:28,269
enormous impact on health,

326
00:19:28,345 --> 00:19:30,695
sometimes really very significantly.

327
00:19:30,795 --> 00:19:33,120
Secondly is that we have
now implementation

328
00:19:33,237 --> 00:19:38,212
strategies which are not so based
on guess work or expert opinion

329
00:19:38,318 --> 00:19:40,881
but really based on evidence.
and I think that's an important

330
00:19:40,969 --> 00:19:45,594
step forward in health and an area
we're going increasingly towards

331
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:49,318
evidence based health interventions.

332
00:19:50,303 --> 00:19:54,466
Since it's evidence based there's
also more consensus

333
00:19:54,604 --> 00:19:57,604
of what it is about

334
00:19:57,967 --> 00:20:01,592
on the best implementation
strategy to use.

335
00:20:03,388 --> 00:20:07,813
It gives us also improved knowledge
and understanding of the key factors

336
00:20:08,037 --> 00:20:13,400
and causing implementation problems,
that we read broader understanding

337
00:20:13,498 --> 00:20:17,361
of the issues in implementation,
increasing our general evidence

338
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:22,071
based and being helpful for
new research in other areas.

339
00:20:22,893 --> 00:20:29,193
And finally it fills the critical
gap in the research pipeline.

340
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:32,419
A gap that shouldn't have
been in the first place

341
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:35,125
and that we're now trying to fill.

342
00:20:35,244 --> 00:20:39,469
The research pipeline and
the implementation pipeline

343
00:20:39,592 --> 00:20:44,142
have to be made to meet up;
and that new interventions

344
00:20:44,274 --> 00:20:48,474
can properly flow
into implementation.

345
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:52,831
So we've come to the end of this
chapter and we conclude that

346
00:20:52,938 --> 00:20:55,875
implementation research for
infectious diseases

347
00:20:55,928 --> 00:21:00,916
of poverty aims to develop effective
implementation strategies for

348
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:03,985
available efficacious interventions.

349
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:09,325
And we say that it's about time,
because this gap in the research

350
00:21:09,459 --> 00:21:13,559
pipeline needs to be filled,
needs to be closed.

351
00:21:13,655 --> 00:21:18,017
And we very much hope that after
this course you will be coming

352
00:21:18,102 --> 00:21:19,265
to help us instead.

353
00:21:19,365 --> 00:21:22,365
Thank you very much.
