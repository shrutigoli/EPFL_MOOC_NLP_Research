1
00:00:04,638 --> 00:00:05,988
Welcome.

2
00:00:06,590 --> 00:00:09,277
My name is Oladele Akogun.

3
00:00:09,693 --> 00:00:12,531
Professor of Public Health
Parasitology

4
00:00:12,731 --> 00:00:15,906
at Modibo Adama University
of Technology in Yola.

5
00:00:16,106 --> 00:00:19,581
In spite of interventions
that are proved

6
00:00:20,177 --> 00:00:24,490
to be efficacious against
infectious diseases,

7
00:00:25,357 --> 00:00:29,032
infectious diseases still
remain persistent.

8
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:34,238
I will give examples from malaria,
from onchocerciasis,

9
00:00:34,766 --> 00:00:37,479
and from cutaneous leishmaniasis.

10
00:00:38,508 --> 00:00:41,608
I will also explain how
implementation research

11
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:43,983
is used to address them.

12
00:00:44,367 --> 00:00:46,005
We start with malaria.

13
00:00:46,205 --> 00:00:49,717
<i>Malaria is caused by
the protozoan parasite</i>

14
00:00:50,364 --> 00:00:53,364
<i>which is transmitted by mosquito</i>

15
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:57,478
<i>and constitutes a major public
health problem</i>

16
00:00:58,293 --> 00:01:00,468
<i>in many parts of Africa.</i>

17
00:01:00,668 --> 00:01:07,168
<i>Worldwide, there are 198 million
malaria cases.</i>

18
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:12,032
<i>80 per cent of this are found
in Africa.</i>

19
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:17,835
<i>Globally, there are
384,000 cases</i>

20
00:01:18,035 --> 00:01:20,560
<i>of death due to malaria.</i>

21
00:01:20,922 --> 00:01:24,635
<i>90 per cent of this
are found in Africa.</i>

22
00:01:24,873 --> 00:01:26,973
<i>I'd like to invite you
to join me</i>

23
00:01:27,582 --> 00:01:31,945
and watch a video on the burden
of malaria in Africa.

24
00:01:37,289 --> 00:01:41,402
<i>Nigeria. More people live here
than anywhere else in Africa.</i>

25
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:47,119
<i>This baby girl has
a serious fever.</i>

26
00:01:47,319 --> 00:01:48,869
<i>It's malaria.</i>

27
00:01:50,847 --> 00:01:54,922
<i>For 2 days, Sherifa Jiboa has
been giving her daughter Grace Abba </i>

28
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:58,122
<i>medicine brewed from herbs
and bark.</i>

29
00:01:58,405 --> 00:02:00,393
<i>Grace who is just 3 years old</i>

30
00:02:00,593 --> 00:02:02,993
<i>is in a bad way and needs
proper treatment.</i>

31
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:11,251
<i>But the nearest help
is 26 miles away.</i>

32
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:13,632
<i>Sherifat has no option,</i>

33
00:02:13,857 --> 00:02:15,607
<i>she has to walk.</i>

34
00:02:17,574 --> 00:02:19,949
<i>Like most women
in rural Nigeria</i>

35
00:02:20,149 --> 00:02:23,774
<i>she can't afford to take time off
whenever one of her children gets sick.</i>

36
00:02:25,038 --> 00:02:26,976
<i>According to the World
Health Organization,</i>

37
00:02:27,203 --> 00:02:31,815
<i>malaria claims the lives
of over 270,000 children</i>

38
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:34,653
<i>in Nigeria every year.</i>

39
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:39,896
<i>That's a third of all the children
who die of malaria in Africa.</i>

40
00:02:42,908 --> 00:02:46,883
Did you notice that access
to intervention

41
00:02:47,351 --> 00:02:50,426
is a major hindrance
reducing the burden

42
00:02:50,626 --> 00:02:53,113
of the disease in that video?

43
00:02:53,313 --> 00:02:56,313
The promise of efficacious
interventions

44
00:02:57,168 --> 00:02:58,618
are available.

45
00:02:58,859 --> 00:03:01,446
Artemisinin combination therapy,

46
00:03:01,834 --> 00:03:07,059
an anti malaria medicine for prompt
and efficacious treatment of malaria

47
00:03:07,259 --> 00:03:08,534
is available.

48
00:03:09,201 --> 00:03:11,164
Insecticide treatment nets,

49
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:16,966
indoor residual spraying against
vectors to reduce exposure

50
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:19,714
to effective mosquito bites,

51
00:03:20,315 --> 00:03:22,315
are also available.

52
00:03:22,515 --> 00:03:25,365
<i>Preventive therapy for malaria
risk groups</i>

53
00:03:26,536 --> 00:03:28,273
<i>such as pregnant women,</i>

54
00:03:28,635 --> 00:03:30,172
<i>infants,</i>

55
00:03:30,596 --> 00:03:32,359
<i>are also available.</i>

56
00:03:32,559 --> 00:03:36,346
<i>Seasonal malaria chemoprevention
is also available.</i>

57
00:03:37,915 --> 00:03:42,415
Challenges due to
lack of access

58
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:45,053
to effective treatment remains

59
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:47,940
a major hindrance

60
00:03:48,248 --> 00:03:52,373
to prevention and treatment
of malaria.

61
00:03:52,924 --> 00:03:55,261
Malaria treatment occurs
in the home,

62
00:03:55,518 --> 00:03:57,618
outside the health facility.

63
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:01,386
Self medication with poor
quality medicines

64
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:05,682
which are purchased from
unregulated sources

65
00:04:07,118 --> 00:04:08,468
abound.

66
00:04:09,153 --> 00:04:11,578
Less than a quarter of children

67
00:04:11,778 --> 00:04:16,953
receive recommended artemisinin-based
chemotherapy.

68
00:04:18,906 --> 00:04:22,431
And between 50 to 70 percent
of children

69
00:04:22,631 --> 00:04:26,306
die without contact with
the health facility.

70
00:04:27,523 --> 00:04:30,923
Most of them die within
48 hours

71
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:34,163
of onset of malaria symptoms.

72
00:04:34,897 --> 00:04:38,610
<i>The major problem,
is how to achieve</i>

73
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:41,235
<i>universal prompt</i>

74
00:04:41,668 --> 00:04:46,818
<i>and effective treatment
with anti malaria</i>

75
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:52,271
<i>within 24 hours of the onset
of symptoms.</i>

76
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:56,134
<i>Another example I'll like
to share is onchocerciasis.</i>

77
00:04:56,628 --> 00:05:01,316
<i>Onchocerciasis is caused by
onchocerca volvulus</i>

78
00:05:01,636 --> 00:05:04,598
<i>which is transmitted by
the black fly</i>

79
00:05:04,798 --> 00:05:07,236
<i>that breeds
in fast flowing rivers.</i>

80
00:05:07,436 --> 00:05:10,436
<i>This disease, also called
river blindness,</i>

81
00:05:10,816 --> 00:05:13,166
<i>leads to a stigmatizing</i>

82
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:15,794
<i>skin disease</i>

83
00:05:15,994 --> 00:05:20,082
<i>which eventually often leads
to blindness,</i>

84
00:05:20,497 --> 00:05:23,222
<i>a major health problem
in Africa.</i>

85
00:05:23,904 --> 00:05:28,391
<i>99.5 percent of the 37 million
infected people</i>

86
00:05:28,591 --> 00:05:30,216
<i>are found in Africa.</i>

87
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:34,829
<i>3.5 million  disability
adjusted life years</i>

88
00:05:35,029 --> 00:05:38,504
<i>are lost annually as a result
of onchocerciasis.</i>

89
00:05:38,902 --> 00:05:41,927
<i>Leading to abandonment
of otherwise</i>

90
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:45,127
<i>very fertile agricultural
lands.</i>

91
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:51,376
<i>which leads to enormous socio
economic loss to the region.</i>

92
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:54,502
Let us now watch a short video

93
00:05:54,702 --> 00:05:58,352
on the burden of onchocerciasis
in Africa.

94
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:07,278
<i>A busy market in rural Nigeria.</i>

95
00:06:07,821 --> 00:06:11,621
<i>This part of Nigeria is severely
affected by a parasitic worm</i>

96
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:14,203
<i>which damages the skin
and eyes.</i>

97
00:06:15,117 --> 00:06:17,455
<i>It causes terrible
itching.</i>

98
00:06:17,805 --> 00:06:20,755
<i>In the worst cases, it can
make you go blind.</i>

99
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,162
<i>The parasitic worms can cause
terrible sores</i>

100
00:06:24,362 --> 00:06:25,837
<i>and lesions.</i>

101
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:28,550
<i>Locals call this leopard skin.</i>

102
00:06:29,494 --> 00:06:33,357
<i>This disease is called
onchocerciasis, or river blindness</i>

103
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:36,880
<i>because the black flies which
spread the parasites to humans</i>

104
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,048
<i>breed in rivers and streams.</i>

105
00:06:41,873 --> 00:06:43,973
<i>I grew up in a place
called Baruwa.</i>

106
00:06:44,635 --> 00:06:46,773
<i>River blindness is common there.</i>

107
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:49,798
<i>There are lots of rivers, that's
why it's so common.</i>

108
00:06:49,998 --> 00:06:53,373
<i>My father actually went blind
from this disease.</i>

109
00:06:53,573 --> 00:06:56,348
<i>I was afraid that I would
lose my sight as well.</i>

110
00:06:57,073 --> 00:07:00,586
<i>River blindness affects 30 countries
in Africa alone.</i>

111
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:04,693
<i>The World Health Organization
estimates that half a million people</i>

112
00:07:04,893 --> 00:07:06,518
<i>are blind because of it.</i>

113
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,437
<i>River blindness is one
of their biggest problems.</i>

114
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:13,279
<i>Fortunately, there is a drug
which can prevent the disease.</i>

115
00:07:13,525 --> 00:07:15,488
<i>It's called Ivermectin.</i>

116
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:20,706
<i>For 20 years, Ivermectin has been
provided free by the makers, Merck.</i>

117
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:23,724
<i>It works by killing
the young worms</i>

118
00:07:23,924 --> 00:07:25,899
<i>known as microfilariae.</i>

119
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,824
<i>A single annual dose
is all that's needed</i>

120
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:32,874
<i>to kill almost all the microfilariae
in a person's body.</i>

121
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,973
<i>But getting ivermectin to
all the people who need it</i>

122
00:07:37,173 --> 00:07:39,023
<i>is a massive task.</i>

123
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:41,788
For millions of people
in Africa,

124
00:07:41,988 --> 00:07:45,325
<i>rivers and streams are the most
important sources of water.</i>

125
00:07:45,902 --> 00:07:49,802
<i>But these are also the preferred
breeding grounds for black fly.</i>

126
00:07:50,254 --> 00:07:52,229
<i>This disease affects poor
populations</i>

127
00:07:52,596 --> 00:07:54,746
<i>at very difficult
and remote areas;</i>

128
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:57,259
and getting this drug to
the people who need it

129
00:07:57,459 --> 00:07:58,897
is one of the major
challenges.

130
00:07:59,097 --> 00:08:02,959
Did you notice that access
to free medicine

131
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:05,972
was the implementation problem?

132
00:08:06,172 --> 00:08:10,422
<i>Before 1987, there was no
safe drug against onchocerciasis.</i>

133
00:08:10,757 --> 00:08:14,795
<i>Vector control was limited
to the West African savannah.</i>

134
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:19,957
<i>Nothing could be done about
the 85 percent of infected people.</i>

135
00:08:20,273 --> 00:08:23,648
But a breakthrough occurred
in 1987

136
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:27,233
<i>when ivermectin
was registered</i>

137
00:08:27,433 --> 00:08:29,983
<i>against onchocerciasis
for human use.</i>

138
00:08:30,461 --> 00:08:32,924
<i>It's donated free of charge</i>

139
00:08:33,124 --> 00:08:35,549
<i>as long as needed.</i>

140
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:39,236
<i>It is safe for large scale
treatment.</i>

141
00:08:40,067 --> 00:08:44,079
<i>Ivermectin is effective
against microfilariae</i>

142
00:08:44,505 --> 00:08:47,805
<i>when taken annually
for a long time.</i>

143
00:08:48,126 --> 00:08:51,438
<i>Unfortunately, it has
limited effect</i>

144
00:08:51,814 --> 00:08:55,952
<i>on adult worm which lives
for between 15 to 20 years.</i>

145
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,922
<i>The problem of onchocerciasis</i>

146
00:08:59,182 --> 00:09:01,995
<i>is that we require
to give</i>

147
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:08,832
<i>ivermectin every year to
more than 160 million people</i>

148
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:12,223
<i>living in 28
African countries.</i>

149
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:14,587
<i>So the implementation
problem is,</i>

150
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:19,846
<i>how can a high annual coverage
of ivermectin treatment</i>

151
00:09:20,249 --> 00:09:24,112
<i>of over 160 million people
be sustained</i>

152
00:09:24,485 --> 00:09:28,147
<i>every year for over 50 years?</i>

153
00:09:28,585 --> 00:09:30,235
Given the fact that

154
00:09:30,876 --> 00:09:33,864
the people who are affected
live in rural areas,

155
00:09:34,815 --> 00:09:38,165
in conflict situations,
and the health system,

156
00:09:38,876 --> 00:09:41,551
where it exists, is heavily
overburdened.

157
00:09:41,898 --> 00:09:44,773
Or is too weak to take on
such a burden.

158
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:47,986
Or there are no health
facilities at all

159
00:09:48,718 --> 00:09:53,106
in most of the countries and
communities that are affected.

160
00:09:53,859 --> 00:09:57,671
<i>The 3rd example is cutaneous
leishmaniasis.</i>

161
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:01,671
<i>In Tunisia, rodents
live in burrows,</i>

162
00:10:02,299 --> 00:10:04,449
<i>and are protected
by vegetation</i>

163
00:10:04,649 --> 00:10:06,136
<i>such as this.</i>

164
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:09,260
<i>And these rodents serve
as reservoirs</i>

165
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:12,810
<i>for cutaneous leishmania
parasites.</i>

166
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:16,922
<i>Mechanical removal of
the vegetation, the chenopods,</i>

167
00:10:17,362 --> 00:10:19,624
<i>and replacement
with acacia,</i>

168
00:10:19,824 --> 00:10:23,962
<i>gets rid of the reservoir
and of course, the disease</i>

169
00:10:24,296 --> 00:10:26,371
<i>cutaneous leishmaniasis.</i>

170
00:10:26,571 --> 00:10:28,146
<i>But then the problem is,</i>

171
00:10:28,346 --> 00:10:31,646
<i>chenopods are feeds for animals.</i>

172
00:10:31,913 --> 00:10:37,488
<i>So getting rid of them means there's
no vegetation for grazing animals,</i>

173
00:10:37,688 --> 00:10:39,401
<i>sheep and cow.</i>

174
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:41,870
<i>It is costly to plough</i>

175
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,433
<i>on a large scale.</i>

176
00:10:43,633 --> 00:10:46,020
<i>It has impact on biodiversity.</i>

177
00:10:46,332 --> 00:10:50,157
<i>And of course, getting
a multi sectorial approach </i>

178
00:10:50,646 --> 00:10:53,233
that is required for
this intervention

179
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:56,085
<i>becomes a challenge
to the health system.</i>

180
00:10:56,384 --> 00:10:59,472
<i>So implementation research
problem is</i>

181
00:11:00,578 --> 00:11:04,328
<i>how to implement
an efficacious</i>

182
00:11:04,528 --> 00:11:08,490
<i>intervention of such
a large scale ploughing</i>

183
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:11,095
<i>in an acceptable manner?</i>

184
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,305
There several other examples

185
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,135
where

186
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:21,135
the promise of efficacious
intervention

187
00:11:21,516 --> 00:11:24,328
has had implementation problems.

188
00:11:26,105 --> 00:11:28,455
Insecticide treated nets.

189
00:11:29,549 --> 00:11:33,111
Less than 50 percent
of people

190
00:11:34,156 --> 00:11:37,593
sleep inside these nets

191
00:11:37,793 --> 00:11:40,456
despite its effectiveness.

192
00:11:41,822 --> 00:11:43,709
Praziquantel.

193
00:11:43,909 --> 00:11:46,909
Less than 14 percent
receive treatment

194
00:11:47,109 --> 00:11:50,759
despite the availability
of praziquantel.

195
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,375
TB, tuberculosis diagnosis.

196
00:11:56,071 --> 00:12:00,121
Less than 65 percent diagnosed

197
00:12:00,745 --> 00:12:02,282
and notified

198
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:05,943
of cases of tuberculosis.

199
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,495
Integrated management of
Dengue fever for example.

200
00:12:11,393 --> 00:12:13,293
The coverage is still very low

201
00:12:13,974 --> 00:12:15,961
to prevent transmission

202
00:12:16,161 --> 00:12:20,811
despite the integrated management
approach that is available.

203
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:26,586
The hygiene management lymphatic
filariasis morbidity

204
00:12:27,165 --> 00:12:29,290
is a technique that is available,

205
00:12:29,909 --> 00:12:32,747
yet only a small fraction

206
00:12:33,888 --> 00:12:35,201
of lymphoedema cases

207
00:12:35,693 --> 00:12:40,356
benefit from the use
of this technique.

208
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:42,029
In this chapter

209
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:45,767
on promise and problems
of implementation against

210
00:12:46,872 --> 00:12:49,084
the infectious diseases of poverty,

211
00:12:50,095 --> 00:12:55,220
we acknowledged the public health
and socio economic problems

212
00:12:55,899 --> 00:12:57,486
of these diseases.

213
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,447
We noted that efficacious
interventions

214
00:13:03,046 --> 00:13:06,596
are available, free of charge
in some cases

215
00:13:06,995 --> 00:13:08,908
or highly subsidized

216
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:11,235
in other cases.

217
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:15,831
The major hindrance
to implementation

218
00:13:16,031 --> 00:13:19,606
is access to the promise;

219
00:13:20,221 --> 00:13:22,721
due to the health
system's inability

220
00:13:22,921 --> 00:13:27,908
to take advantage of
the efficacious interventions

221
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:30,154
that are available.

222
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:33,280
In the 2nd chapter,

223
00:13:33,931 --> 00:13:38,906
we shall be discussing how
implementation research

224
00:13:39,268 --> 00:13:42,168
lives up to
that promise.

225
00:13:43,393 --> 00:13:46,131
Thank you for your attention.
