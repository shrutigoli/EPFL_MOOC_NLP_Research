1
00:00:04,544 --> 00:00:06,287
The 2nd example I like to use

2
00:00:06,487 --> 00:00:10,135
to illustrate implementation
research at work

3
00:00:10,335 --> 00:00:15,826
is the Community-directed Interventions
against health problems,

4
00:00:16,026 --> 00:00:18,659
otherwise called CDI.

5
00:00:18,859 --> 00:00:21,612
In this case, the implementation challenge

6
00:00:21,812 --> 00:00:25,902
was how to achieve and sustain

7
00:00:26,102 --> 00:00:30,495
very high coverage of ivermectin
for several years

8
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:37,360
in an area that is endemic
with Onchocerciasis.

9
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:43,004
Given that Onchocerciasis control
requires annual treatment

10
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:46,672
of a total population that is at risk,

11
00:00:46,872 --> 00:00:51,585
reaching a very high treatment coverage
level for several years,

12
00:00:51,785 --> 00:00:55,392
as much as 15 years,

13
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:58,083
is a major challenge to the health
system.

14
00:00:58,283 --> 00:01:03,498
Experiences have shown that
mobile teams have been tried;

15
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:08,511
they have been used to see if such
a high coverage could be achieved.

16
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:11,426
Unfortunately, it was too expensive.

17
00:01:11,626 --> 00:01:15,265
Coverage reach was not satisfactory.

18
00:01:15,465 --> 00:01:18,397
Community-based approaches
were introduced,

19
00:01:18,597 --> 00:01:22,195
yet coverage was less than satisfactory

20
00:01:22,395 --> 00:01:26,261
and the sustainability issue
was still a problem.

21
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:29,246
So Tropical Diseases Research Programme

22
00:01:29,446 --> 00:01:34,376
was asked to study all of these
community-based approaches

23
00:01:34,576 --> 00:01:40,700
and to find the most effective
and sustainable method of treatment

24
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:44,552
of light populations over several years.

25
00:01:44,752 --> 00:01:50,579
In 1994, TDR launched a 2 phases
multi-country study.

26
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:54,165
The 1st phase was formative research.

27
00:01:54,365 --> 00:02:00,600
All of the community-based approaches that
were designed for communities were studied.

28
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:02,588
The finding was,

29
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:06,681
community members were not involved.

30
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:09,214
Community members were mere recipients

31
00:02:09,414 --> 00:02:12,806
of the service that was visiting the community.

32
00:02:13,006 --> 00:02:16,264
Their participation was very little.

33
00:02:16,464 --> 00:02:20,655
Most staff only made it to mobilizing
members of the community

34
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:22,311
to a central area,

35
00:02:22,511 --> 00:02:26,456
where the ivermectin, a drug,
was distributed

36
00:02:26,656 --> 00:02:30,897
by non governmental organizations
or health workers.

37
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:35,404
So they were passive recipients.

38
00:02:36,707 --> 00:02:39,128
The finding from this formative phase

39
00:02:39,328 --> 00:02:42,694
also showed that communities
were capable

40
00:02:42,894 --> 00:02:47,140
of organizing themselves

41
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:50,805
around complex activities,

42
00:02:51,005 --> 00:02:53,208
sharing resources,

43
00:02:53,408 --> 00:02:57,920
and delivering services to members
of their community.

44
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,054
The findings from this formative phase

45
00:03:01,254 --> 00:03:04,635
led to an experimental study;

46
00:03:04,835 --> 00:03:11,358
an experimental study of community-directed
treatment with ivermectin.

47
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:14,833
The study, at this experimental stage,

48
00:03:15,033 --> 00:03:21,159
compared an approach that is designed
by the community itself

49
00:03:21,359 --> 00:03:25,782
with another approach that is designed
by the program.

50
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:29,103
The findings from the experimental
research concluded that

51
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:32,303
community-directed treatment
with ivermectin

52
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,861
is feasible and effective.

53
00:03:35,061 --> 00:03:38,545
It's likely to be sustainable.

54
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:41,378
It can achieve very high coverage.

55
00:03:41,578 --> 00:03:45,077
Correct treatment procedures

56
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:49,759
are capable of being complied with

57
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:51,879
by community members.

58
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,091
The study drew attention,

59
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:57,212
just like we found in home management,

60
00:03:57,412 --> 00:03:59,501
to certain key points.

61
00:03:59,701 --> 00:04:02,087
These are:
- Flexibility.

62
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:06,589
The importance of flexibility
at the community

63
00:04:06,789 --> 00:04:12,427
operational level was traced
in the findings.

64
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:16,475
The issue of reporting was also mentioned.

65
00:04:16,675 --> 00:04:22,146
You will recall that we discussed,
during the home management approach,

66
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:27,370
the issue of reporting,
which was a problem.

67
00:04:28,547 --> 00:04:31,063
It was also found that
it remained a problem

68
00:04:31,263 --> 00:04:35,836
for community distributors to report
properly

69
00:04:36,036 --> 00:04:39,793
after delivering service
to members of their community.

70
00:04:39,993 --> 00:04:43,688
Like we found in home management
of malaria,

71
00:04:43,888 --> 00:04:47,142
community-directed treatment
with ivermectin

72
00:04:47,342 --> 00:04:48,963
has since evolved,

73
00:04:49,163 --> 00:04:53,058
riding on implementation research
all the way.

74
00:04:53,258 --> 00:04:55,470
In 1996,

75
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:01,481
implementation research showed that
community-directed intervention strategy

76
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:04,282
was feasible and effective

77
00:05:04,482 --> 00:05:07,392
and likely to be sustained.

78
00:05:07,592 --> 00:05:12,819
In 1997, the African Programme
for Onchocerciasis Control,

79
00:05:13,019 --> 00:05:16,923
APOC, adopted it as a main strategy.

80
00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:21,295
So the resource for the implementation
research was grabbed

81
00:05:21,495 --> 00:05:24,211
immediately after it came out
by APOC.

82
00:05:24,411 --> 00:05:26,310
In 1999,

83
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:29,694
treatment coverage with ivermectin,

84
00:05:30,395 --> 00:05:34,853
using this community-directed treatment
with ivermectin approach,

85
00:05:35,053 --> 00:05:40,106
was noted to be about 2 times higher

86
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:45,386
than conventional methods that
had always been used by the health system.

87
00:05:45,586 --> 00:05:49,579
CDDs, that is the Community Directed
Distributors,

88
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,860
as the community providers were called,

89
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:56,874
were very much involved in other
health interventions,

90
00:05:57,074 --> 00:06:00,535
indicating that there was a wide
acceptance.

91
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:04,954
So the community-directed distributors
at the community level

92
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:09,222
were very much involved in other activities
at the community level.

93
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:13,733
The excitement led APOC to ask TDR

94
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:18,031
to study the use, further,
of CDTi strategy

95
00:06:18,231 --> 00:06:23,250
for other interventions with different
complexity levels.

96
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,567
So we can see how CDTi

97
00:06:27,767 --> 00:06:31,297
evolved to the next stage.

98
00:06:31,497 --> 00:06:34,179
Community-directed intervention

99
00:06:34,379 --> 00:06:38,916
could be used for other interventions
of different complexities.

100
00:06:39,116 --> 00:06:42,116
The attribute of implementation
research

101
00:06:42,316 --> 00:06:49,550
to respond to the needs
of implementation barriers

102
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,685
was clearly demonstrated here.

103
00:06:52,885 --> 00:06:56,415
Let's look at community-directed
intervention, briefly,

104
00:06:56,615 --> 00:06:58,606
which is the strategy we are talking about;

105
00:06:58,806 --> 00:07:03,341
the intervention that was to be applied.

106
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:05,213
It is a health intervention

107
00:07:05,413 --> 00:07:07,835
which is undertaken
at the community level

108
00:07:08,035 --> 00:07:11,772
under the direction
of the community itself.

109
00:07:11,972 --> 00:07:14,135
So communities have a role to play.

110
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,287
The health system has a role to play.

111
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:20,722
Working together as partners,
that's crucial

112
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:23,922
in community-directed intervention.

113
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:26,071
The steps are shown.

114
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:27,558
One thing we should note is that

115
00:07:27,758 --> 00:07:34,610
community is not a passive
recipient of service

116
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,835
but a central player

117
00:07:38,035 --> 00:07:42,198
to the service being given
at the community level

118
00:07:42,398 --> 00:07:48,081
and a partner to the implementing
agency, like the health system.

119
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:52,741
In this case, a multi-country study
on CDI,

120
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:59,421
implementation research was set out
to answer the question:

121
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:06,344
how far will the community-directed
intervention approach go

122
00:08:06,544 --> 00:08:10,246
where there are multiple health issues?

123
00:08:10,446 --> 00:08:13,095
The study designed in this case

124
00:08:13,295 --> 00:08:17,792
takes into consideration the complexity.

125
00:08:17,992 --> 00:08:20,754
We look at complexity in 2 ways.

126
00:08:20,954 --> 00:08:23,673
There is the complexity of the individual
interventions,

127
00:08:23,873 --> 00:08:26,957
for example CDTi

128
00:08:27,157 --> 00:08:29,015
and Vitamin A

129
00:08:29,215 --> 00:08:31,975
are taken as very simple,

130
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:35,578
a single commodity given annually,

131
00:08:35,778 --> 00:08:38,175
insecticide treated bed nets.

132
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,646
The bed nets are bulky,

133
00:08:40,846 --> 00:08:46,421
and there is also the complexity
of utilization:

134
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:48,370
home management of malaria

135
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,175
and where individual case management
was required.

136
00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,647
Malaria was, throughout the year

137
00:08:54,847 --> 00:08:58,852
introducing a different type of complexity.

138
00:08:59,052 --> 00:09:01,308
Then of course there is DOTS.

139
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:03,356
In the case of tuberculosis,

140
00:09:03,556 --> 00:09:07,213
case detection and referral

141
00:09:07,413 --> 00:09:12,061
were complex issues that needed
to be looked at as well.

142
00:09:13,558 --> 00:09:17,611
Besides the complexity of the individual
interventions,

143
00:09:17,811 --> 00:09:21,679
there is also the complexity of the number
of interventions

144
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:26,146
that would be managed by the community
at the same time.

145
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:33,162
Different districts were selected for different
intervention periods

146
00:09:33,362 --> 00:09:35,963
so that by the 3rd year,

147
00:09:36,163 --> 00:09:39,028
all the interventions had been added.

148
00:09:39,228 --> 00:09:45,193
Typically, as we found in the home
management of malaria,

149
00:09:45,393 --> 00:09:49,074
a major element in implementation
research

150
00:09:49,274 --> 00:09:53,078
is the multi-disciplinary team approach

151
00:09:53,278 --> 00:09:55,188
which involves experts.

152
00:09:55,388 --> 00:09:59,417
From affected countries, you have
the epidemiologists,

153
00:09:59,617 --> 00:10:04,132
the health economists, social behavioral
scientists, statisticians,

154
00:10:04,332 --> 00:10:08,774
data managers, as you will see
in the picture.

155
00:10:08,974 --> 00:10:11,584
For all the interventions,

156
00:10:11,784 --> 00:10:16,098
community-directed intervention

157
00:10:16,298 --> 00:10:21,477
yielded a higher average than
the current approach.

158
00:10:21,677 --> 00:10:26,443
Whether it is malaria, where coverage
was twice as high

159
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:27,937
as what was obtained.

160
00:10:28,137 --> 00:10:33,647
The insecticide treated nets,
which was twice as high as well.

161
00:10:33,847 --> 00:10:40,162
Vitamin A and the ivermectin coverage
was significantly higher,

162
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:41,991
showing that

163
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:47,910
despite the complexity of the interventions

164
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:52,388
and the fact that there were multiple
interventions

165
00:10:52,588 --> 00:10:54,438
being put together at the same time,

166
00:10:54,638 --> 00:10:58,157
it was still highly effective.

167
00:10:58,357 --> 00:10:59,983
Communities, therefore,

168
00:11:00,183 --> 00:11:06,880
could handle several interventions
at the same time,

169
00:11:07,080 --> 00:11:10,620
irrespective of their complexity.

170
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,905
This does not apply to DOTS.

171
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:18,796
For reasons that there were not
so many

172
00:11:18,996 --> 00:11:22,541
tuberculosis cases in the villages,

173
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:25,741
there is the issue of stigma
that is referral.

174
00:11:27,421 --> 00:11:32,462
With respect to efficiency
of community-directed intervention,

175
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:34,812
it was highly cost effective

176
00:11:35,012 --> 00:11:38,705
and the health system did not have
to bear all the cost

177
00:11:38,905 --> 00:11:42,310
because the cost was spread out
to other stakeholders,

178
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:45,334
particularly the community.

179
00:11:45,534 --> 00:11:50,183
In order to tease out the critical factors

180
00:11:50,383 --> 00:11:54,767
that facilitated and that make that

181
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:57,182
community-directed intervention

182
00:11:57,382 --> 00:12:01,726
an elaborate design of a conceptual
framework

183
00:12:01,926 --> 00:12:06,958
of the CDI process pre-guided
the social-behavioral aspect

184
00:12:07,158 --> 00:12:08,580
of our research

185
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:14,023
and key elements of our process
was developed there.

186
00:12:14,223 --> 00:12:15,646
Looks very complex

187
00:12:15,846 --> 00:12:20,061
and takes into consideration
lots of issues

188
00:12:20,261 --> 00:12:22,520
from the stakeholder process,

189
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,626
to the health system dynamics,

190
00:12:24,826 --> 00:12:27,733
as well as how communities are engaged,

191
00:12:27,933 --> 00:12:29,708
how they are empowered,

192
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:34,733
as well as the engagement of the CDI
implementers,

193
00:12:34,933 --> 00:12:38,799
right up to the broader health
system issues.

194
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:43,326
As we found in home management
of malaria,

195
00:12:45,259 --> 00:12:49,156
one critical, facilitating factor

196
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:52,356
for the community-directed intervention,

197
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:58,505
which was reported using the implementation
research to tease it out,

198
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:03,172
was the role of the community actors.

199
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:08,324
Communities shared the burden

200
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:11,155
of implementation with the health
system.

201
00:13:11,355 --> 00:13:17,302
So the CDDs took some of the time,

202
00:13:17,502 --> 00:13:22,961
quicker too, than the health system
would have shouldered.

203
00:13:23,161 --> 00:13:28,595
Shortage of supplies was a hinderance

204
00:13:28,795 --> 00:13:31,426
to community-directed intervention.

205
00:13:31,626 --> 00:13:33,695
It was reported, as such.

206
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:38,025
So, I repeat,

207
00:13:38,225 --> 00:13:43,750
it is important that an implementation
research

208
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:50,339
identify those factors that we
facilitate, on one hand,

209
00:13:51,649 --> 00:13:56,989
as well as report those factors
that we hinder

210
00:13:57,189 --> 00:13:59,571
so that they can be addressed.

211
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:04,771
There you've seen another design
of implementation research

212
00:14:04,971 --> 00:14:09,323
to address them or getting the health
system just to take note

213
00:14:09,523 --> 00:14:13,433
and be aware that they are there
as hinderances

214
00:14:13,633 --> 00:14:15,304
that need to be addressed.

215
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:20,447
Implementation research will make
recommendations

216
00:14:20,647 --> 00:14:25,952
and share these recommendations
with policy makers and implementers.

217
00:14:26,152 --> 00:14:30,051
For example, as you will see,
in this beautiful photograph,

218
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:32,652
the community-directed intervention team,

219
00:14:32,852 --> 00:14:35,170
the team that did this research,

220
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:39,545
used various approaches to disseminate
the findings.

221
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:43,716
The most important approach
is to make presentation

222
00:14:43,916 --> 00:14:47,121
to the health system.

223
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:54,714
So policy implementers are always waiting
for the results to become available.

224
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:59,671
This was the case in community-directed
intervention that I'm talking about.

225
00:14:59,871 --> 00:15:04,040
The uptake and the scale-up
was immediate.

226
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,810
Another advantage of implementation
research is that

227
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:12,855
the tools, the manuals, and communication
materials that are used

228
00:15:13,055 --> 00:15:16,264
during the implementation research

229
00:15:16,464 --> 00:15:22,514
when refined become easy to use
by the health system,

230
00:15:22,714 --> 00:15:24,721
like monitoring tools,

231
00:15:24,921 --> 00:15:27,043
like evaluation tools.

232
00:15:27,243 --> 00:15:31,570
I will invite you to visit WHO website,

233
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:37,399
download, and watch community-directed
treatment with ivermectin video.

234
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,917
You will like it.

235
00:15:39,117 --> 00:15:44,243
In this chapter, describing what
implementation research really is,

236
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:49,371
we discussed 2 approaches
to implementation research.

237
00:15:50,224 --> 00:15:52,443
The home management studies,

238
00:15:52,643 --> 00:15:56,584
which use the sequential implementation
research approach,

239
00:15:56,784 --> 00:16:00,328
and the multi-country studies,

240
00:16:00,528 --> 00:16:03,644
which was done in 2 phases,

241
00:16:03,844 --> 00:16:06,111
the formative and the experimental.

242
00:16:06,311 --> 00:16:11,510
Both of them have all the elements
of implementation research,

243
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:16,591
which is irrespective of the approach
that one uses,

244
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:22,161
whether sequential, like in the case
of home management of malaria,

245
00:16:22,361 --> 00:16:25,822
or multi-country,

246
00:16:26,022 --> 00:16:29,909
like in the case of community-directed
intervention.

247
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,882
Implementation research is used to resolve

248
00:16:37,082 --> 00:16:42,939
hinderances to the use of efficacious

249
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:46,251
interventions against health problems.

250
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:49,451
Thank you very much,

251
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:50,948
and goodbye.
