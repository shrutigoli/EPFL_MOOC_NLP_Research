00:00:04,966 --> 00:00:07,353
<i>What is implementation research?</i>

2
00:00:07,553 --> 00:00:11,941
<i>This is the question that is 
addressed by the first of 5 modules</i>

00:00:12,691 --> 00:00:15,791

00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:23,766
Hello. My name is Pascale Allotey.

7
00:00:23,966 --> 00:00:25,566
I am the professor of public health,

8
00:00:25,766 --> 00:00:28,128
and I lead a global public 
health research group

9
00:00:28,357 --> 00:00:31,394
at the Monash University
campus in Malaysia.

10
00:00:31,594 --> 00:00:34,919
It is an absolute delight
for me to be able to introduce

11
00:00:35,119 --> 00:00:40,144
this first module of the 5 modules
on implementation research.

12
00:00:40,659 --> 00:00:44,872
Implementation research is actually
carried out across a range of disciplines

13
00:00:45,282 --> 00:00:48,820
and as a result of that, there are 
several definitions available for it.

14
00:00:49,281 --> 00:00:52,669
Now regardless of discipline
or definition,

15
00:00:52,869 --> 00:00:55,869
the underlying concept is
usually the same.

16
00:00:56,205 --> 00:01:00,130
In public health, we usually start
off with a significant health problem

17
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,930
within the population.

18
00:01:02,315 --> 00:01:05,565
On the other hand, there
are efficacious

19
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:08,980
proven interventions
that can help

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,080
to address the health problem.

21
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,718
However, there are 
implementation problems.

22
00:01:14,995 --> 00:01:18,057
The implementation problems
are those problems that

23
00:01:18,282 --> 00:01:22,720
make it difficult for the intervention
to get to those who need it

24
00:01:23,166 --> 00:01:28,016
because of the complexities of poverty,
of poor access to health, and so on.

25
00:01:28,704 --> 00:01:31,354
And this is the role of
implementation research.

26
00:01:31,554 --> 00:01:35,667
It helps us to define and identify

27
00:01:35,912 --> 00:01:39,537
the various mechanisms that
will help to provide

28
00:01:39,737 --> 00:01:42,737
the solutions to the implementation
problems.

29
00:01:43,268 --> 00:01:46,268
And therefore reduce
the health problem.

30
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:50,782
This first module that addresses
the definition

31
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:52,969
of implementation research

32
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:55,582
is divided into 3 chapters.

33
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:59,907
The first chapter addresses
the problems and the promise.

34
00:02:00,257 --> 00:02:02,932
The promise being
the intervention

35
00:02:03,132 --> 00:02:05,932
that is available to address
the problem.

36
00:02:06,314 --> 00:02:10,051
And it uses real life case examples
that begin to illustrate

37
00:02:10,877 --> 00:02:14,314
what the problems are
with implementation.

38
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:21,995
The 2nd chapter looks at specific
implementation research cases,

39
00:02:22,392 --> 00:02:24,904
again, that begin to 
get you thinking

40
00:02:25,104 --> 00:02:27,817
about the nature of
implementation research.

41
00:02:28,017 --> 00:02:31,367
Those first 2 chapters
are introduced to you

42
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:35,017
by Professor Oladele Akogun
from Nigeria.

43
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:38,370
The 3rd and final chapter 
in this module

44
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:41,982
takes us through the theoretical
and conceptual areas

45
00:02:42,182 --> 00:02:45,157
that we need to think about
in designing

46
00:02:45,418 --> 00:02:48,780
and carrying out an implementation
research project.

47
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,830
That 3rd chapter is
introduced to you

48
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,930
by Doctor Hans Remme.

49
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,702
This module is focused
largely on,

50
00:02:56,902 --> 00:03:00,889
the cases that we use, are focused
largely on infectious diseases of poverty.

51
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:05,093
But we would hope that you 
can see through these examples

52
00:03:05,487 --> 00:03:07,800
how you can apply these concepts

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,687
of implementation research to any
other health problem 

54
00:03:11,887 --> 00:03:13,437
that you might be addressing.

55
00:03:13,882 --> 00:03:15,470
By the end of this module,

56
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:19,020
We would hope that you
would be able to describe

57
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:21,295
the scope, the relevance, 

58
00:03:21,495 --> 00:03:25,170
and the key characteristics 
of implementation research.

59
00:03:25,683 --> 00:03:28,995
We would also hope that you would
be able to identify

60
00:03:29,395 --> 00:03:33,632
the range of areas for application
of implementation research

61
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:37,100
regardless of the context
in which you have to work

62
00:03:37,312 --> 00:03:40,824
or the health intervention that
you are having to deal with.

63
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:44,927
The course has been put together
with some really exciting,

64
00:03:45,127 --> 00:03:48,565
real life cases, and we really
hope you enjoy it.

65
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:50,442
Thank you.
