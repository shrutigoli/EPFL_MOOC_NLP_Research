1
00:00:06,667 --> 00:00:09,067
I'm pleased to be able to
introduce students from

2
00:00:09,187 --> 00:00:14,124
around the world to an innovative
new approach to learning on key

3
00:00:14,221 --> 00:00:16,609
issues in global health.

4
00:00:16,748 --> 00:00:21,948
This project is a unique approach
through a massive online course

5
00:00:22,093 --> 00:00:23,918
or MOOC for short.

6
00:00:24,033 --> 00:00:29,396
Initiated by WHO Special Program
for Research and Training in

7
00:00:29,532 --> 00:00:31,232
Tropical Diseases

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:36,015
which has been a pivotal resource
in many areas of research on

9
00:00:36,163 --> 00:00:38,613
tropical infectious diseases

10
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:41,933
through its support for research
and capacity strengthening

11
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:45,075
over the past forty years.

12
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,140
WHO has defined the strategies
for the control of these diseases

13
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:54,686
and created ambitious
targets in a road-map.

14
00:00:56,164 --> 00:01:01,727
However, whilst interventions are
available, which we've implemented

15
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:07,767
would ensure that the targets are
met, most programs face challenges

16
00:01:07,874 --> 00:01:11,412
which can be categorized as
biological, such as the emergence

17
00:01:11,498 --> 00:01:16,573
of drug or insecticide resistance,
or socio-economic challenges

18
00:01:16,656 --> 00:01:22,218
migration, disruptions of programs
due to security issues and conflict

19
00:01:22,337 --> 00:01:27,300
or resource based pressures, all of
which or a combination of them

20
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:30,314
can derail those strategies.

21
00:01:30,436 --> 00:01:35,811
In addition, as new products emerge,
they require to be validated and

22
00:01:35,936 --> 00:01:40,286
subjected to rigorous scrutiny,
before WHO can recommend to

23
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:43,388
countries that they can be
implemented at scale.

24
00:01:44,013 --> 00:01:48,775
The objective of this course is to
highlight the role of implementation

25
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:54,988
research as a critical path of
validating the evidence to improve

26
00:01:55,098 --> 00:01:56,548
interventions.

27
00:01:56,675 --> 00:02:01,025
The course has chosen diverse
sets of conditions which are of

28
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,096
significant public health importance
and which will continue to require

29
00:02:06,232 --> 00:02:10,607
well trained and well equipped
health staff, to implement programs 

30
00:02:10,745 --> 00:02:12,395
in endemic countries

31
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:16,157
and to be up to date in
the current thinking, and also

32
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:19,286
how the recommended
strategies have emerged. 

33
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:24,286
The details of these studies are
elegantly described in the MOOC

34
00:02:24,392 --> 00:02:30,555
providing as it does access to
introductory videos and to detailed

35
00:02:30,689 --> 00:02:34,864
protocols for malaria treatment
for the home based management

36
00:02:34,937 --> 00:02:36,262
in malaria.

37
00:02:36,371 --> 00:02:40,159
The quality of the materials
available in the different media

38
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:42,212
is outstanding

39
00:02:42,322 --> 00:02:47,410
based on many years of experience
by the authors which highlight

40
00:02:47,522 --> 00:02:51,047
the environments in which
the implementation itself

41
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:54,366
is carried out, the need for
collaborative studies

42
00:02:54,465 --> 00:02:58,590
the engagement of many different
disciplines, from clinical sciences

43
00:02:58,722 --> 00:03:04,722
epidemiology, entomology, to social
sciences, all essential elements 

44
00:03:04,847 --> 00:03:07,847
to successful
implementation research.

45
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:11,863
The course emphasizes
the importance of, not only

46
00:03:11,976 --> 00:03:16,601
of community based approaches to
the control of disease, but also

47
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,507
the importance of recognizing
the role of the health systems

48
00:03:20,637 --> 00:03:25,975
in providing the resources to ensure
the products reach populations

49
00:03:26,107 --> 00:03:27,744
at the end of the road.

50
00:03:27,855 --> 00:03:31,305
One of the most significant
and understated benefits

51
00:03:31,395 --> 00:03:35,520
described from the work undertaken
on the community directed treatment

52
00:03:35,602 --> 00:03:40,265
was a figure that some fifty percent
of treatments for river blindness

53
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:44,551
reach communities at least
twenty kilomnters from any

54
00:03:44,687 --> 00:03:46,299
health facility.

55
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:52,067
This emphasizes the importance of
community directed treatments 

56
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,463
and ensuring products reach
the people who most need them.

57
00:03:56,649 --> 00:04:01,637
The MOOC will provide the students
with access to the best available

58
00:04:01,793 --> 00:04:08,105
materials, creating a journey which
is an exemplar of enlightening

59
00:04:08,261 --> 00:04:10,674
stories of applied science.

60
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:15,567
I hope those who are embarking on
this venture into a new approach to

61
00:04:15,676 --> 00:04:21,026
learning will be inspired by
the material, thus demonstrating 

62
00:04:21,139 --> 00:04:27,452
that such research is a fundamental
component of progress in our attempt

63
00:04:27,563 --> 00:04:33,751
to achieve the health targets of
the Sustainable Development Goals.
