000:00:05,153 --> 00:00:06,070Hello100:00:06,254 --> 00:00:06,999Welcome200:00:07,536 --> 00:00:09,143My name is Jorge Arroz300:00:09,227 --> 00:00:10,800and I'm a medical doctor400:00:10,927 --> 00:00:12,228with a Masters degree500:00:12,333 --> 00:00:13,296in Public Health.600:00:13,634 --> 00:00:15,377And actually I'm a PhD student700:00:15,446 --> 00:00:16,520in International Health800:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,327at the Institute of Hygiene900:00:18,409 --> 00:00:19,589and Tropical Medicine1000:00:19,664 --> 00:00:21,486in Lisbon, Portugal.1100:00:23,033 --> 00:00:23,428I'm also1200:00:23,527 --> 00:00:24,947the Malaria Project Senior1300:00:25,023 --> 00:00:26,145Technical Manager1400:00:26,212 --> 00:00:28,941at World Vision Mozambique.1500:00:29,845 --> 00:00:31,271Let's give an overview1600:00:31,375 --> 00:00:33,468of what we are going  to cover today.1700:00:34,451 --> 00:00:36,570First, I'll present an introduction1800:00:36,678 --> 00:00:38,334of the problem related to1900:00:38,623 --> 00:00:40,875bed nets delivery in Mozambique.2000:00:41,843 --> 00:00:42,632Then,2100:00:42,736 --> 00:00:45,112the study will be described together2200:00:45,411 --> 00:00:46,931with the objectives2300:00:47,011 --> 00:00:48,603and the research question.2400:00:49,478 --> 00:00:50,289Finally,2500:00:50,611 --> 00:00:52,998we will cover the different phases2600:00:53,175 --> 00:00:54,772of the project implementation2700:00:54,823 --> 00:00:57,106and we will present some results2800:00:57,299 --> 00:00:58,919from the pilot study.2900:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,095Let's begin3000:01:01,348 --> 00:01:03,320by presenting the problem in Mozambique.3100:01:04,190 --> 00:01:08,096Malaria is considered the most important public health problem in the country3200:01:08,742 --> 00:01:11,020with 35% of children3300:01:11,387 --> 00:01:13,549aged under five years testing positive3400:01:13,936 --> 00:01:16,445for malaria parasites in 2011.3500:01:17,739 --> 00:01:18,263Moreover3600:01:18,263 --> 00:01:19,596in 20143700:01:19,871 --> 00:01:21,907National Malaria Control Programme3800:01:21,957 --> 00:01:23,035reported up to3900:01:23,110 --> 00:01:24,8405.8 million cases4000:01:25,041 --> 00:01:25,723of malaria4100:01:25,857 --> 00:01:26,687with up to4200:01:26,813 --> 00:01:28,1793.2 thousand deaths4300:01:28,292 --> 00:01:29,329related to it.4400:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,142Now,4500:01:31,238 --> 00:01:32,514getting back to bed net4600:01:32,602 --> 00:01:33,957distribution mass campaigns4700:01:34,082 --> 00:01:35,567for universal coverage,4800:01:35,729 --> 00:01:38,4443 main challenges were identified.4900:01:39,209 --> 00:01:40,871The first one is related5000:01:41,034 --> 00:01:43,739to household registration process.5100:01:44,562 --> 00:01:45,975So, in order to plan5200:01:46,138 --> 00:01:47,246and quantify the amount5300:01:47,384 --> 00:01:48,078of bed nets5400:01:48,434 --> 00:01:51,172it's important to do a registration5500:01:51,285 --> 00:01:53,320of all the households.5600:01:54,322 --> 00:01:56,367This process is conducted5700:01:56,492 --> 00:01:58,523by local volunteers5800:01:58,863 --> 00:02:00,162and they have to go5900:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,555house by house6000:02:01,681 --> 00:02:04,230to register the household members.6100:02:04,843 --> 00:02:06,390The registration form6200:02:06,515 --> 00:02:08,130was too complex6300:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,578because the recorders6400:02:09,665 --> 00:02:11,226had to collect information6500:02:11,375 --> 00:02:12,161on the names,6600:02:12,567 --> 00:02:13,654age,6700:02:14,039 --> 00:02:15,040and gender6800:02:15,164 --> 00:02:17,457of all household members.6900:02:17,802 --> 00:02:18,505Also,7000:02:18,629 --> 00:02:19,718the risk of having7100:02:19,868 --> 00:02:21,847a double registration7200:02:22,022 --> 00:02:22,810was high7300:02:22,897 --> 00:02:25,810because houses were not marked7400:02:26,047 --> 00:02:27,181On the other side,7500:02:27,503 --> 00:02:28,620for the same reason7600:02:29,062 --> 00:02:30,553sometimes we missed7700:02:30,728 --> 00:02:32,409registering some houses.7800:02:33,721 --> 00:02:34,990Another complexity7900:02:35,114 --> 00:02:36,354was related to the time8000:02:36,491 --> 00:02:38,160that people had to wait8100:02:38,284 --> 00:02:39,744to receive the bed nets8200:02:40,110 --> 00:02:42,509without any kind of assurance8300:02:42,630 --> 00:02:43,727that they will in fact8400:02:43,876 --> 00:02:45,245receive the bed nets.8500:02:46,030 --> 00:02:47,503The second challenge8600:02:47,878 --> 00:02:50,024was related to the criteria8700:02:50,186 --> 00:02:51,725to distribute bed nets8800:02:51,874 --> 00:02:53,753per each household.8900:02:54,348 --> 00:02:55,921The number of bed nets9000:02:56,045 --> 00:02:57,039for each household9100:02:57,387 --> 00:02:59,808depends on many parameters:9200:02:59,968 --> 00:03:01,391sleeping patterns,9300:03:01,541 --> 00:03:02,241age,9400:03:02,403 --> 00:03:03,205and gender. This process is time consuming9500:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,411and sometimes difficult9600:03:07,573 --> 00:03:08,775to put into practice.9700:03:10,506 --> 00:03:11,356Finally9800:03:11,493 --> 00:03:12,613there were long queues9900:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,347to receive the bed nets.10000:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,324The main reason10100:03:16,486 --> 00:03:17,467for these queues10200:03:17,579 --> 00:03:18,989is related to the fact10300:03:19,151 --> 00:03:19,946that the names10400:03:20,083 --> 00:03:21,989had to be confirmed10500:03:22,164 --> 00:03:24,239in the registration list10600:03:24,401 --> 00:03:27,138and sometimes the names were not10700:03:27,325 --> 00:03:29,391in that particular list10800:03:30,093 --> 00:03:31,567More specifically10900:03:31,691 --> 00:03:33,752the objective of this study11000:03:33,902 --> 00:03:35,873is to compare bed net coverage11100:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,059by households11200:03:37,271 --> 00:03:40,384before and after the intervention.11300:03:41,064 --> 00:03:43,798So what is the research question?11400:03:44,599 --> 00:03:46,162The research question11500:03:46,324 --> 00:03:48,455in this study is the following:11600:03:48,969 --> 00:03:51,195Is bed net coverage by households11700:03:51,345 --> 00:03:54,141changing after the invention?11800:04:02,990 --> 00:04:03,440Hello!11900:04:03,665 --> 00:04:04,653Welcome again!12000:04:04,853 --> 00:04:07,853We're going to have an interview with doctor Jorge Arroz,12100:04:08,053 --> 00:04:10,778who's in charge of the new pattern12200:04:10,978 --> 00:04:14,428of distribution of bed nets in Mozambique.12300:04:14,628 --> 00:04:15,441Hello Jorge12400:04:15,641 --> 00:04:17,753Hello, professor Maria do RosÃ¡rio12500:04:17,953 --> 00:04:20,653It's a great pleasure to be here,12600:04:20,853 --> 00:04:22,641[to speak] about a study that took place in Mozambique.12700:04:22,841 --> 00:04:23,378Right12800:04:23,578 --> 00:04:27,553We're now going to start12900:04:27,778 --> 00:04:31,728by describing the precise context of the study.13000:04:31,928 --> 00:04:35,641Well, the study was done in Mozambique13100:04:35,841 --> 00:04:38,678in the central region,13200:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,815a region where there is a high occurrence of malaria13300:04:43,765 --> 00:04:46,741as well as in two other provinces13400:04:46,941 --> 00:04:50,878where malaria is widespread,13500:04:51,078 --> 00:04:55,177the context is fairly rural,13600:04:57,215 --> 00:05:01,078and where availability of health care is not very good.13700:05:01,302 --> 00:05:05,815Access to health care providers is not easy,13800:05:06,015 --> 00:05:08,828and the people, the population13900:05:09,028 --> 00:05:11,253have to travel huge distances14000:05:11,890 --> 00:05:15,140to have access to very basic health services.14100:05:15,652 --> 00:05:19,290Right. Let's now go to the next phase.14200:05:19,515 --> 00:05:25,478I imagine that before these new measures were implemented14300:05:25,678 --> 00:05:27,715what's called an analysis of the situation14400:05:27,915 --> 00:05:28,878was done14500:05:29,078 --> 00:05:30,691with various actors14600:05:30,891 --> 00:05:33,853and that some conclusions were reached?14700:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,678I'd like you to tell us a little about this14800:05:36,878 --> 00:05:38,641and what were the main problems14900:05:38,841 --> 00:05:40,841faced in the course of this analysis.15000:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,116Well, an analysis of the situation was done15100:05:44,316 --> 00:05:46,028including various actors,15200:05:46,228 --> 00:05:48,116the Ministry of Health,15300:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,740its representatives15400:05:51,940 --> 00:05:53,578at the level of the provinces and  districts.15500:05:53,778 --> 00:05:57,691Besides these actors,15600:05:57,866 --> 00:06:02,303health-care partners were involved,15700:06:02,503 --> 00:06:04,266non-governmental organisations15800:06:04,466 --> 00:06:06,278one of which I belong to,15900:06:06,478 --> 00:06:07,566Care Vision International,16000:06:09,403 --> 00:06:11,703and there also was the involvement16100:06:11,903 --> 00:06:13,928of the community leaders,16200:06:14,128 --> 00:06:15,203of  the community structures,16300:06:15,403 --> 00:06:18,403as actors that participated actively 16400:06:18,603 --> 00:06:21,678in the process of distribution of bed nets.16500:06:22,678 --> 00:06:24,641-Right. So what were the main conclusions16600:06:24,841 --> 00:06:25,853you have reached?16700:06:26,053 --> 00:06:29,903-During this analysis of the situation,16800:06:31,753 --> 00:06:37,403three main conclusions clearly appeared.16900:06:38,916 --> 00:06:43,066The first being related to the process of registering17000:06:43,266 --> 00:06:44,178the members of a household.17100:06:44,353 --> 00:06:46,716One of the main steps17200:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,166is to register all families17300:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,041that live in a given area,17400:06:50,241 --> 00:06:54,441and we saw that this process was much too complex17500:06:54,641 --> 00:06:57,191with registrations forms filled17600:06:57,391 --> 00:07:02,166with information on the members of  the household,17700:07:02,366 --> 00:07:06,016for example the name of each member of the household,17800:07:06,216 --> 00:07:08,678with age and gender.17900:07:08,878 --> 00:07:11,278This made things a little more difficult18000:07:11,478 --> 00:07:12,303and would make18100:07:12,491 --> 00:07:14,178the process of registration more complex.18200:07:14,378 --> 00:07:17,453Another point linked to the process of registration18300:07:17,653 --> 00:07:22,953was the possibility of double registration18400:07:23,365 --> 00:07:24,266of the houses,18500:07:25,153 --> 00:07:26,316as they were not marked18600:07:26,516 --> 00:07:32,303and the possibility of a house not being registered.18700:07:33,203 --> 00:07:37,178Also, the second important aspect18800:07:37,366 --> 00:07:38,653of this situation analysis18900:07:38,853 --> 00:07:43,941was linked to the process of attribution19000:07:44,141 --> 00:07:45,366of the bed nets19100:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,190to the families, which was complex.19200:07:49,115 --> 00:07:53,802A fairly complex form of attribution of bed nets was needed19300:07:54,640 --> 00:08:01,677and we ended up having to evaluate19400:08:01,877 --> 00:08:04,315the distribution itself, and we reached the conclusion19500:08:04,541 --> 00:08:08,316that the people had to queue up for a very long time19600:08:08,516 --> 00:08:11,140waiting to receive a bed net.19700:08:11,616 --> 00:08:13,753So, the questions of the registration,19800:08:13,953 --> 00:08:16,453of the households members,19900:08:16,653 --> 00:08:20,416and the long waiting queues20000:08:20,616 --> 00:08:23,766and the criteria for the attribution of the bed nets20100:08:23,953 --> 00:08:25,416are the three key aspects20200:08:25,616 --> 00:08:28,691that stood out as a result of the analysis of situation.20300:08:28,891 --> 00:08:29,778So I imagine that20400:08:29,978 --> 00:08:32,141for this process to be implemented,20500:08:32,353 --> 00:08:34,403there were various phases?20600:08:34,603 --> 00:08:38,040I'd like you to tell us a little about those phases20700:08:38,566 --> 00:08:41,678that unfolded20800:08:42,116 --> 00:08:43,478so that in the end,20900:08:43,678 --> 00:08:46,265the new strategies were implemented.21000:08:47,477 --> 00:08:50,440-The distribution process of nets21100:08:50,640 --> 00:08:53,190has its various phases,21200:08:53,978 --> 00:08:55,302and for the first phase,21300:08:55,502 --> 00:08:59,152it was necessary for the health-care authorities21400:08:59,365 --> 00:09:01,277to   have the required competence,21500:09:01,478 --> 00:09:04,790therefore for the team, at the district level21600:09:04,990 --> 00:09:06,214to be trained.21700:09:07,077 --> 00:09:09,865Sometimes, these people, after receiving training,21800:09:10,027 --> 00:09:12,340would themselves train21900:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,665other persons at the district level22000:09:14,865 --> 00:09:17,576in order to strengthen,22100:09:17,764 --> 00:09:20,139and increase the district team,22200:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,915also involving the community leaders.22300:09:26,115 --> 00:09:28,426They were selected22400:09:28,602 --> 00:09:32,077for a specific locality, region or neighborhood,22500:09:32,289 --> 00:09:34,452and volunteers worked on this process22600:09:34,652 --> 00:09:36,652of registration of members of  households.22700:09:36,815 --> 00:09:39,090It was important for these people22800:09:39,290 --> 00:09:40,627to be members of the community,22900:09:40,827 --> 00:09:43,577as they are be better accepted,23000:09:43,715 --> 00:09:47,752by the members of households,23100:09:47,902 --> 00:09:50,115who open  the doors to their houses more easily23200:09:50,277 --> 00:09:51,439and trust them more.23300:09:54,002 --> 00:09:56,765And these recorders, as we call people in charge of the registration,23400:09:56,965 --> 00:09:58,239are also given training.23500:09:59,701 --> 00:10:05,139They are given the forms, receipts and stickers.23600:10:05,365 --> 00:10:09,102in order to identify the houses that have been registered.23700:10:09,302 --> 00:10:10,740The receipts guarantee23800:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,290that the families will finally go23900:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,351where the distribution is to take place24000:10:14,564 --> 00:10:18,089and receive the due number of bed nets.24100:10:19,177 --> 00:10:21,090This information, having been collected24200:10:21,290 --> 00:10:24,840and the date of distribution having been set,24300:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,302the distribution points being as close as possible24400:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,352to the given community,24500:10:30,552 --> 00:10:33,240the families get there with the receipts24600:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,415and are given the bed nets.24700:10:35,615 --> 00:10:39,240So, in general, these are the phases24800:10:39,415 --> 00:10:42,339of the process of distribution24900:10:43,314 --> 00:10:44,315in the new pattern.25000:10:44,515 --> 00:10:47,052From what I can see, there are three innovations25100:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,027in this new pattern, aren't there?25200:10:49,152 --> 00:10:52,852To start,  the process of attribution25300:10:53,002 --> 00:10:56,002of a set number of nets per family was simplified,25400:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,290then the introduction of vouchers25500:10:59,502 --> 00:11:02,490that enable a better identification25600:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,690of the families when they claim the nets they are entitled to25700:11:05,890 --> 00:11:09,489and allow those huge waiting queues to be avoided,25800:11:11,239 --> 00:11:16,015and we can add that the fact that there are stickers25900:11:16,215 --> 00:11:20,565has reduced the amount of over information26000:11:20,765 --> 00:11:24,214or lack or information on the families. Would you agree?26100:11:24,377 --> 00:11:27,852Right. And to my mind, the first very important aspect26200:11:28,052 --> 00:11:30,390was the simplification of the methodology26300:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,915leading to the attribution of the bed nets26400:11:33,115 --> 00:11:38,515which basically is, nowadays, a bed net for every two people.26500:11:40,752 --> 00:11:44,265In fact, the receipts, which are vouchers26600:11:44,465 --> 00:11:50,127allow the families to have a form of document26700:11:50,477 --> 00:11:53,090they can easily take to the distribution point26800:11:53,290 --> 00:11:57,227and easily be identified as already registered.26900:11:57,427 --> 00:11:59,902And to finish, the stickers have in fact27000:12:00,102 --> 00:12:01,477enabled the avoidance of27100:12:01,677 --> 00:12:05,715double registration of the members of households27200:12:05,915 --> 00:12:08,652as they indicated which houses had been registered27300:12:08,852 --> 00:12:12,552and also if a house didn't have a sticker to it,27400:12:12,752 --> 00:12:14,565it implied it had not been registered27500:12:14,765 --> 00:12:16,527and the supervision team27600:12:16,727 --> 00:12:18,727that monitors the registration27700:12:18,927 --> 00:12:21,277would spot the house and send a team of recorders27800:12:21,477 --> 00:12:24,377to that community27900:12:24,552 --> 00:12:27,339and to those houses to make the registration.28000:12:27,515 --> 00:12:31,877Very well. You have spoken about these three innovations,28100:12:33,277 --> 00:12:37,140The people that are watching us are probably curious to know28200:12:37,340 --> 00:12:40,902what the vouchers were like28300:12:41,102 --> 00:12:43,377and would like to know more about28400:12:43,565 --> 00:12:45,690this new technique of distribution.28500:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,615Can you give [a] detailed explanation?28600:12:47,815 --> 00:12:50,327What was the format of the vouchers,28700:12:50,527 --> 00:12:52,290what information did they carry,28800:12:57,315 --> 00:13:00,027between the old method, that was more complex,28900:13:00,227 --> 00:13:01,840with a more complex pattern29000:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,027of distribution of nets to the families29100:13:04,227 --> 00:13:06,315and now your new simpler method?29200:13:06,515 --> 00:13:08,327Let's have a little more explanation,29300:13:08,527 --> 00:13:10,677it's important as these concern the strategies,29400:13:10,852 --> 00:13:12,364the most important points in your study.29500:13:12,714 --> 00:13:17,052That's right. So the voucher was made of two parts:29600:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,490the left part, was a stub29700:13:20,690 --> 00:13:24,465that was kept by the recorder29800:13:24,665 --> 00:13:27,965and the team involved in the process of distribution,29900:13:28,590 --> 00:13:31,665and the right part, was the receipt of the voucher30000:13:31,865 --> 00:13:33,377given to the family30100:13:33,577 --> 00:13:38,552and gave basic information on where the family lived,30200:13:38,752 --> 00:13:42,202the area where it was located,30300:13:42,402 --> 00:13:46,165the number of members living in the household30400:13:46,365 --> 00:13:47,240which is very important30500:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,152as the first change was the formula30600:13:52,364 --> 00:13:56,065to enable the attribution of a bed net to each household30700:13:56,265 --> 00:13:59,265and basically, the formula was30800:13:59,465 --> 00:14:01,152the number of members of the household30900:14:01,352 --> 00:14:02,302divided by two,31000:14:02,502 --> 00:14:06,327and rounded up to an even number.31100:14:06,527 --> 00:14:08,427-This is the new formula? -This is the new formula.31200:14:08,627 --> 00:14:09,877And was the old one like?31300:14:10,077 --> 00:14:14,002The old formula would, after gathering information31400:14:14,202 --> 00:14:21,277on the age, gender and number of members of a household31500:14:21,477 --> 00:14:24,877attempt to establish patterns of sleeping habits,31600:14:26,202 --> 00:14:28,677such as, for example, in one family31700:14:28,877 --> 00:14:33,752where there were three members in the household,31800:14:33,952 --> 00:14:38,902it was possible to receive one, two or three bed nets.31900:14:39,102 --> 00:14:44,002For example, in the old model of distribution32000:14:44,227 --> 00:14:48,327a family with a father, a  mother and a two-year-old child32100:14:48,515 --> 00:14:49,790would receive one bed net,32200:14:49,990 --> 00:14:53,415because they were supposed to all sleep together.32300:14:54,177 --> 00:14:57,902But, if in this family the child was already ten years old,32400:14:58,102 --> 00:15:00,827they were to receive two bed nets32500:15:01,027 --> 00:15:03,677because the father and the mother were to sleep together32600:15:03,877 --> 00:15:06,202and then the child was to sleep on his own.32700:15:06,677 --> 00:15:09,340However, if that family were to be composed32800:15:09,540 --> 00:15:14,252of a father, a grand-father and of a twenty-year-old child,32900:15:14,452 --> 00:15:21,877as it's not possible to have the father share his bed33000:15:22,077 --> 00:15:25,165with the grand-father or the twenty-year old son,33100:15:25,415 --> 00:15:27,940they had to receive three bed nets.33200:15:28,165 --> 00:15:29,490There were three situations,33300:15:29,690 --> 00:15:34,152three possibilities for attribution of bed nets,33400:15:34,377 --> 00:15:36,977for the same household composition.33500:15:37,164 --> 00:15:39,390This is what has changed in the new system.33600:15:39,590 --> 00:15:42,115where the number of members of a household33700:15:42,352 --> 00:15:43,352is simply divided by two,33800:15:43,552 --> 00:15:47,402the goal being one bed net33900:15:47,602 --> 00:15:49,377for two people.34000:15:49,577 --> 00:15:51,277So, it must be simpler...34100:15:51,477 --> 00:15:53,752-Much simpler. -For those who have to calculate34200:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,815there are fewer parameters.34300:15:56,015 --> 00:15:58,177Besides the receipts, there were stickers.34400:15:58,402 --> 00:16:05,801The stickers gave basic information as the location of34500:16:06,015 --> 00:16:07,727the neighborhood, the community,34600:16:07,914 --> 00:16:11,790and that the house had been registered.34700:16:11,990 --> 00:16:16,177And you would stick it on the main door of the house34800:16:16,377 --> 00:16:18,015of the hut,34900:16:18,215 --> 00:16:20,865to my mind, in this context it's more a hut,35000:16:21,065 --> 00:16:25,277seeing the rural context of the communities where we worked35100:16:25,477 --> 00:16:28,490and tested the new pattern.35200:16:28,690 --> 00:16:33,515However, when the supervisors checking the registrations35300:16:33,715 --> 00:16:39,890would arrive at a community and see houses without stickers,35400:16:40,090 --> 00:16:44,977they would by principle deduce that the house had not been registered.35500:16:45,177 --> 00:16:48,890It made it easier to send a more specific team35600:16:49,065 --> 00:16:52,540to the community to register those families.35700:16:52,715 --> 00:16:53,652Thank you very much.35800:16:53,852 --> 00:16:56,852So now that we have talked about these new strategies,35900:16:57,052 --> 00:16:59,715we've been allowed to talk about what will follow the study.36000:16:59,915 --> 00:17:03,027We have already spoken about the investigation,36100:17:03,227 --> 00:17:07,090and now for those taking part in the investigation,36200:17:07,290 --> 00:17:09,752there are more years of studies, aren't there?36300:17:09,927 --> 00:17:12,515Could you talk about what will follow the study?36400:17:12,715 --> 00:17:16,052Well, the present study36500:17:16,252 --> 00:17:19,727is  made of a mix of methodology36600:17:19,977 --> 00:17:23,877with a qualitative component and a quantitative one.36700:17:24,077 --> 00:17:27,715The qualitative component:36800:17:27,915 --> 00:17:33,440in each of the phases of the process36900:17:33,652 --> 00:17:35,565of distribution of bed nets,37000:17:35,765 --> 00:17:38,377there was a focal discussion group 37100:17:38,577 --> 00:17:41,702with the key actors of that phase.37200:17:41,902 --> 00:17:46,853The goal was to try to gather as much information37300:17:47,053 --> 00:17:51,765on what had happened during that phase, or during all the phases,37400:17:51,978 --> 00:17:52,978the pros and cons37500:17:53,178 --> 00:17:54,715of each step37600:17:54,915 --> 00:17:58,952to better adjust the interventions.37700:18:01,203 --> 00:18:03,965Already, in the quantitative component37800:18:07,803 --> 00:18:08,003the study was  37900:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,79038000:18:10,790 --> 00:18:07,803a quasi- experimental study in which we had a district  38100:18:07,803 --> 00:18:11,04038200:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,265that was a district of intervention38300:18:13,465 --> 00:18:17,290in which the new pattern of distribution was followed38400:18:17,490 --> 00:18:20,528that is, a bed net for every two persons,38500:18:20,728 --> 00:18:22,678the use of vouchers,38600:18:22,878 --> 00:18:24,640the use of stickers38700:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,540for the identification of the houses.38800:18:28,353 --> 00:18:33,215Meanwhile there was the control group,38900:18:33,415 --> 00:18:35,715the district of control,39000:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,065which had had a previous intervention.39100:18:38,265 --> 00:18:43,565with those complex criteria of registration39200:18:43,777 --> 00:18:48,990of attribution of a bed net to each member of a household.39300:18:49,178 --> 00:18:52,578We tried as best as we could to obtain something comparable39400:18:52,778 --> 00:18:56,503from one district to another in terms of rural characteristics39500:18:56,715 --> 00:19:01,478and even in terms of people who had benefited39600:19:01,678 --> 00:19:04,678or who wanted to receive a bed net.39700:19:04,915 --> 00:19:07,115Right. I have a question for you,39800:19:07,315 --> 00:19:09,865in this qualitative study, in the qualitative part,39900:19:10,065 --> 00:19:12,440you said there were focal groups, with the key actors40000:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,190and they made conclusions.40100:19:14,390 --> 00:19:16,113Was the process changed40200:19:16,313 --> 00:19:19,313in order to take into account what the comments had been?40300:19:19,514 --> 00:19:20,714Do you have an example?40400:19:20,914 --> 00:19:24,914It was noted that the physical quality of the vouchers40500:19:25,114 --> 00:19:27,952that had been made40600:19:28,152 --> 00:19:30,914was not adapted and resistant,40700:19:31,127 --> 00:19:36,189taking into account where the family was going to store40800:19:36,389 --> 00:19:37,463the vouchers.40900:19:37,964 --> 00:19:39,952The study there is finished41000:19:40,152 --> 00:19:44,677but in another district that was being used as a pilot too,41100:19:44,877 --> 00:19:50,314we were able to better a little the quality of the receipts,41200:19:50,488 --> 00:19:50,976and vouchers41300:19:51,139 --> 00:19:59,076and this was one of the lessons we quickly managed to grasp41400:19:59,326 --> 00:20:01,489with something positive for the implementation,41500:20:01,689 --> 00:20:02,902with somewhat of a success41600:20:03,102 --> 00:20:05,601in the other district of intervention.41700:20:05,976 --> 00:20:07,551Very well. We're about to finish.41800:20:07,739 --> 00:20:08,939Now, the fundamental question:41900:20:09,139 --> 00:20:11,702we have already defined the strategies,42000:20:11,702 --> 00:20:12,139we have already defined the aim of the investigation, 42200:20:15,364 --> 00:20:18,727and now, we don't know, so we need to test,42300:20:18,927 --> 00:20:21,314to see if we get results.42400:20:21,514 --> 00:20:24,739We have already spoken about what has been done,42500:20:24,939 --> 00:20:25,689the pilot study.42600:20:25,889 --> 00:20:29,851And what were the main conclusions you've reached?42700:20:30,163 --> 00:20:35,889First, in terms of variants for the measure of the results,42800:20:36,089 --> 00:20:39,176of the study, of the implementation,42900:20:39,376 --> 00:20:40,976we  used,43000:20:41,176 --> 00:20:45,301first the percentage of bed nets43100:20:45,501 --> 00:20:50,889that were distributed compared to what had been planned,43200:20:51,089 --> 00:20:53,276and then the coverage of bed nets43300:20:53,501 --> 00:20:55,389in the households,43400:20:55,589 --> 00:20:56,638therefore in the families.43500:20:56,838 --> 00:21:01,151And what we observed43600:21:01,351 --> 00:21:05,476as the result of the implementation of the research43700:21:05,676 --> 00:21:08,076was that after five days,43800:21:08,276 --> 00:21:12,451with the first results,43900:21:12,651 --> 00:21:15,926the percentage of bed nets distributed44000:21:16,126 --> 00:21:21,114using the new pattern of distribution,44100:21:21,314 --> 00:21:26,801was greater than the one obtained with the previous pattern.44200:21:27,001 --> 00:21:31,664With the new pattern, we reached 88%,44300:21:31,864 --> 00:21:37,064while we had reached 77% with the previous pattern.44400:21:37,264 --> 00:21:39,989And you saw this difference as meaningful, didn't you?44500:21:40,214 --> 00:21:43,989This difference was statistically meaningful. That's correct.44600:21:44,176 --> 00:21:48,476As far as the coverage of households is concerned,44700:21:48,726 --> 00:21:50,701of bed nets in the households,44800:21:50,901 --> 00:21:53,114again after five days44900:21:53,314 --> 00:21:56,314which is the number of days necessary45000:21:56,514 --> 00:21:59,426for the distribution of the bed nets45100:21:59,626 --> 00:22:03,926there was a difference between the groups,45200:22:04,126 --> 00:22:07,551the district of implementation with the new pattern45300:22:07,751 --> 00:22:11,214compared to a district using the previous pattern.45400:22:11,414 --> 00:22:15,589With the new pattern of implementation,45500:22:15,776 --> 00:22:19,289the coverage was larger,45600:22:19,489 --> 00:22:22,50180 percent, around 81 percent45700:22:22,701 --> 00:22:27,976compared to coverage in the district where the old pattern was used45800:22:28,176 --> 00:22:30,164which was 73 percent.45900:22:30,364 --> 00:22:32,651And this difference too was....46000:22:32,851 --> 00:22:34,376It too was statistically significant.46100:22:34,576 --> 00:22:37,314Yes, I still have a question for you:46200:22:37,514 --> 00:22:39,239when did the study take place,46300:22:39,439 --> 00:22:44,851as for us it's important to know when it took place.46400:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,676Well... the study46500:22:48,876 --> 00:22:51,376took place last year, in 2015,46600:22:51,576 --> 00:22:55,676from October to December 46700:22:55,876 --> 00:22:58,114in 2015.46800:22:59,851 --> 00:23:05,089The results were already available in January,46900:23:05,351 --> 00:23:12,164for a more exhaustive, careful analysis, to follow with new steps.47000:23:12,376 --> 00:23:15,114That's true. So, what are the next steps?47100:23:15,314 --> 00:23:17,114With these results,47200:23:17,314 --> 00:23:19,364we have already had a process of socialization47300:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,114with the Health Ministry,47400:23:22,314 --> 00:23:27,126with various actors active in the process of distribution,47500:23:27,326 --> 00:23:29,651from both the provinces and the districts involved,47600:23:29,851 --> 00:23:35,901and this new strategy was adopted by the Health Ministry,47700:23:36,101 --> 00:23:40,164in view of a massive distribution of bed nets at the national level.47800:23:40,351 --> 00:23:45,826A first phase will take place on a large scale47900:23:46,001 --> 00:23:48,639in one of the provinces of North Mozambique48000:23:48,839 --> 00:23:50,851more precisely in the province of Nampula,48100:23:51,051 --> 00:23:54,826which is planned for this year, in 2016.48200:23:55,026 --> 00:23:57,364Very well. So, I want to thank everybody48300:23:57,564 --> 00:24:01,564for being with us today.48400:24:01,726 --> 00:24:06,589We're  going to close this cycle of MOOC Module number 3,48500:24:06,789 --> 00:24:09,526I hope you've enjoyed it, and see you soon.
