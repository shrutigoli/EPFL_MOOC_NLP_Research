000:00:05,674 --> 00:00:06,486Hello,100:00:06,673 --> 00:00:08,412it's good to be with you again.200:00:09,075 --> 00:00:12,861Today, my topic is on the justification of the choice300:00:13,074 --> 00:00:16,075of a particular implementation strategy.400:00:16,274 --> 00:00:18,787It is the second talk, in this series,500:00:19,012 --> 00:00:20,962that will discuss in detail600:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,099the design  of an implementation strategy.700:00:24,711 --> 00:00:27,136Let me begin by giving you an  overview800:00:27,361 --> 00:00:29,537of what I want to cover today.900:00:29,900 --> 00:00:32,861First, I'm going to introduce you [to] some approaches1000:00:33,062 --> 00:00:36,248to identify potential needs, barriers,1100:00:36,486 --> 00:00:38,800and facilitators to implementation.1200:00:39,337 --> 00:00:43,074Then, I'm going to talk about some factors1300:00:43,312 --> 00:00:46,349that must be taken into account in the selection1400:00:46,562 --> 00:00:49,999of the most appropriate implementation strategies,1500:00:50,225 --> 00:00:53,762and this together with real life examples.1600:00:54,425 --> 00:00:58,599And finally, I'm going to present you a very recent study1700:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,462on specific methods that can be used1800:01:01,699 --> 00:01:05,337to improve the selection of implementation strategies.1900:01:06,187 --> 00:01:10,237So, the fundamental point that drives this segment2000:01:10,475 --> 00:01:15,125is that, given several implementation strategies,2100:01:15,350 --> 00:01:18,099we should give a clear justification2200:01:18,325 --> 00:01:22,311of why the specific strategy was selected.2300:01:23,561 --> 00:01:27,387If we choose a strategy that cannot be justified,2400:01:27,611 --> 00:01:29,649then, we should be careful2500:01:29,887 --> 00:01:31,660about its application.2600:01:31,899 --> 00:01:34,499So, at the end of this chapter,2700:01:34,737 --> 00:01:39,799we hope that you will be able to use different methods,2800:01:40,024 --> 00:01:42,836approaches to identify potential needs2900:01:43,061 --> 00:01:44,874barriers or facilitators,3000:01:45,100 --> 00:01:48,724to identify factors to be taken into account3100:01:48,924 --> 00:01:51,499when selecting an implementation strategy3200:01:51,700 --> 00:01:54,462and also, to apply these concepts3300:01:54,687 --> 00:01:56,612in real-life situations.3400:01:57,275 --> 00:01:58,662In the previous chapter,3500:01:58,900 --> 00:02:02,187we saw that implementation strategies3600:02:02,424 --> 00:02:04,711can be more or less complex3700:02:04,961 --> 00:02:07,886and that multi-faceted strategies3800:02:08,099 --> 00:02:12,361can be built combining several single strategies.3900:02:12,999 --> 00:02:15,149We also present some approaches4000:02:15,387 --> 00:02:18,487that can be used to describe and classify4100:02:18,775 --> 00:02:20,261implementation strategies.4200:02:20,512 --> 00:02:21,437Do you remember?4300:02:22,062 --> 00:02:25,612We saw that strategies can be classified4400:02:25,825 --> 00:02:29,475using, for example, implementation phases,4500:02:29,874 --> 00:02:33,250but also according to main actors.4600:02:33,749 --> 00:02:37,074So, in designing implementation strategies,4700:02:37,274 --> 00:02:42,986we must make efforts to provide a clear justification4800:02:43,224 --> 00:02:47,562to the strategy we use to implement a given intervention.4900:02:48,199 --> 00:02:52,987Let's go back to the example related to the Home Management of Malaria.5000:02:53,937 --> 00:02:55,949One of the implementation strategies5100:02:56,174 --> 00:03:00,312was training community based providers.5200:03:00,511 --> 00:03:01,349Do you remember?5300:03:02,049 --> 00:03:05,724So, why did they choose this strategy5400:03:05,924 --> 00:03:09,724and not another one, based, for example, on health providers?5500:03:10,973 --> 00:03:14,098Before the selection of a particular strategy,5600:03:14,323 --> 00:03:15,699we need to identify5700:03:15,924 --> 00:03:18,961the needs, barriers or facilitators,5800:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,499also called determinants of practice.5900:03:23,498 --> 00:03:26,887Then, we must provide a clear justification6000:03:27,112 --> 00:03:30,424of why the particular strategy was selected.6100:03:31,386 --> 00:03:34,861Why would this implementation strategy help6200:03:35,099 --> 00:03:38,274in overcoming potential barriers to implementation?6300:03:38,874 --> 00:03:40,874This is the key question.6400:03:41,724 --> 00:03:46,049The choice of the most appropriate implementation strategy6500:03:46,311 --> 00:03:48,011is a complex job,6600:03:48,385 --> 00:03:51,999and there is not a lot of information  on this area.6700:03:52,786 --> 00:03:56,261However, there is a very recent and growing work6800:03:56,486 --> 00:03:58,799on the subject that can help us.6900:03:59,724 --> 00:04:04,574For example, this study, published in 2013,7000:04:04,786 --> 00:04:10,624presents a check list with 57 potential determinants of practice,7100:04:10,962 --> 00:04:13,649grouped in seven domains:7200:04:14,399 --> 00:04:15,912guideline factors,7300:04:16,149 --> 00:04:18,812individual health professional factors,7400:04:19,224 --> 00:04:20,662patient factors,7500:04:20,899 --> 00:04:23,049professional interactions,7600:04:23,274 --> 00:04:26,249incentives and resources,7700:04:26,474 --> 00:04:30,187capacity for organizational change,7800:04:30,412 --> 00:04:34,237social, political and legal factors.7900:04:34,899 --> 00:04:37,949The check-list presented in this paper8000:04:38,174 --> 00:04:41,062is complemented with five worksheets8100:04:41,299 --> 00:04:45,212to facilitate its use in implementation research8200:04:45,437 --> 00:04:48,399and also in quality improvement projects.8300:04:48,787 --> 00:04:50,699I strongly recommend you8400:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,099to take a look inside of the paper,8500:04:53,348 --> 00:04:57,762and to read carefully the content of the worksheets.8600:04:58,012 --> 00:05:01,949The paper can be found in this link. 8700:05:03,111 --> 00:05:05,474So, the first question is:8800:05:05,724 --> 00:05:09,087How can we identify potential needs,8900:05:09,299 --> 00:05:12,861barriers or facilitators to implementation?9000:05:13,886 --> 00:05:16,199There are several approaches.9100:05:17,024 --> 00:05:20,461These determinants of practice can be identified9200:05:20,662 --> 00:05:22,687through [a] formal assessment process,9300:05:22,912 --> 00:05:27,361using theory or conceptual models,9400:05:27,623 --> 00:05:33,699using research literature or using more informal approaches9500:05:33,986 --> 00:05:36,074such as brainstorming.9600:05:37,462 --> 00:05:39,112Let us give some examples.9700:05:39,362 --> 00:05:43,586We want to identify barriers or facilitators9800:05:43,811 --> 00:05:47,511related to bed-net delivery in African countries.9900:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,222We can use a revision of the literature.10000:05:51,497 --> 00:05:57,560For example, this paper is on a systematic review on the subject.10100:05:57,786 --> 00:06:02,736And the authors found that stock-outs and poor logistics10200:06:02,961 --> 00:06:05,936for bed-net procurement and transport10300:06:06,136 --> 00:06:07,635are potential barriers.10400:06:07,848 --> 00:06:12,911And they also found that training and supervision of staff10500:06:13,923 --> 00:06:17,486are potential facilitators to implementation.10600:06:18,385 --> 00:06:22,772Another example is related to the community-directed interventions10700:06:23,009 --> 00:06:24,986that you saw in the first module.10800:06:25,261 --> 00:06:26,073Do you remember?10900:06:26,785 --> 00:06:29,923In this case, there is a conceptual model11000:06:30,136 --> 00:06:35,898of critical factors in the community-directed intervention11100:06:36,323 --> 00:06:40,060that has already been developed.11200:06:41,748 --> 00:06:44,797Now that we saw different approaches11300:06:45,023 --> 00:06:48,698for the identification of the determinants of practice,11400:06:49,048 --> 00:06:51,647we must try to provide a justification11500:06:51,910 --> 00:06:56,347for the selection of a particular implementation strategy.11600:06:57,323 --> 00:07:02,310Let's go back to the example related to the delivery of bed-nets11700:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,798in African countries.11800:07:04,523 --> 00:07:05,634What do we know?11900:07:05,860 --> 00:07:09,309We know that appropriate use of bed-nets12000:07:09,547 --> 00:07:11,385can prevent malaria.12100:07:11,948 --> 00:07:15,785However, a percentage of children under five12200:07:16,023 --> 00:07:18,697sleeping under bed-nets is still very low12300:07:18,872 --> 00:07:20,810in many African countries.12400:07:21,709 --> 00:07:26,659We need first to identify potential barriers to implementation.12500:07:27,286 --> 00:07:30,748And then, we select the most appropriate strategy.12600:07:30,973 --> 00:07:33,472We know that in many countries12700:07:33,698 --> 00:07:37,472bed-net distribution had been usually managed12800:07:37,709 --> 00:07:39,097by the health system.12900:07:39,747 --> 00:07:43,798Many times, in the context of immunization campaigns.13000:07:44,397 --> 00:07:45,886At the time of this study,13100:07:46,523 --> 00:07:51,634the concept of community based distribution of bed-nets was new.13200:07:52,834 --> 00:07:56,272Why the particular strategy was selected?13300:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,659The strategies developed were based on previous effective strategies13400:08:01,884 --> 00:08:06,433used for the control and elimination of other diseases.13500:08:06,934 --> 00:08:11,897So, one possibility is to choose the implementation strategy13600:08:12,121 --> 00:08:14,496based on empirical studies.13700:08:14,722 --> 00:08:17,196But the selection of the most appropriate13800:08:17,434 --> 00:08:21,959implementation strategy can also  be done based on other factors.13900:08:22,371 --> 00:08:25,709For example, relevant theory14000:08:26,971 --> 00:08:30,421might be appropriate to address the specific challenge14100:08:30,622 --> 00:08:32,795 raised by implementation context.14200:08:32,996 --> 00:08:36,221Another example is to base our choice14300:08:36,409 --> 00:08:39,284on some pragmatic justification.14400:08:40,696 --> 00:08:43,471Finally, I would like to bring your attention14500:08:43,683 --> 00:08:45,421to a very recent study14600:08:45,620 --> 00:08:50,334where specific methods are proposed to improve the selection14700:08:50,546 --> 00:08:53,008of implementations strategies.14800:08:55,284 --> 00:08:57,745In this paper, the authors propose14900:08:57,946 --> 00:09:02,696a step by step process for selecting implementation strategies,15000:09:03,234 --> 00:09:05,659but also, for engaging stakeholders.15100:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,946This approach can be very useful15200:09:09,146 --> 00:09:12,721to both researchers and program managers.15300:09:12,921 --> 00:09:16,109and can be used in very different contexts.15400:09:16,984 --> 00:09:20,158However, because it is a very recent paper,15500:09:20,359 --> 00:09:24,859there are still no practical examples related to diseases of poverty.15600:09:25,609 --> 00:09:28,646I strongly recommend you to read this study,15700:09:28,846 --> 00:09:32,108and who knows if you are not going to be [a] pioneer15800:09:32,334 --> 00:09:33,859in its application.15900:09:34,433 --> 00:09:39,934So, don't forget, as I mentioned at the beginning of this lecture,16000:09:40,471 --> 00:09:44,508given several possible implementation strategies,16100:09:44,708 --> 00:09:47,559we should give a clear justification16200:09:47,759 --> 00:09:51,671of why this specific strategy was selected.16300:09:52,921 --> 00:09:56,684If we choose a strategy that cannot be justified,16400:09:57,109 --> 00:10:00,909then we should be careful about its application.16500:10:01,984 --> 00:10:06,459So, that brings me to the end of what I wanted to cover today.16600:10:07,634 --> 00:10:11,209The next lecture will be on research designs16700:10:11,409 --> 00:10:14,809and will be presented by Doctor Neil Alexander.16800:10:16,609 --> 00:10:21,196It's a pleasure to be with you today, and thank you for your attention.
