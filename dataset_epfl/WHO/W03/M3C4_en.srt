000:00:04,474 --> 00:00:08,552Welcome back. I'm Neal Alexander from CIDEIM in Cali100:00:08,955 --> 00:00:10,507and in this chapter, we're going to continue200:00:10,574 --> 00:00:13,183with how to choose a suitable implementation research design.300:00:13,390 --> 00:00:16,386There are many different study designs. You can read about them in the book400:00:16,497 --> 00:00:19,560by Bonita and others, that's published by WHO500:00:19,721 --> 00:00:21,883and you can get it as a free download.600:00:22,018 --> 00:00:24,131The details are in the bibliography at the end.700:00:24,470 --> 00:00:28,342For now, we're just very simply going to distinguish between800:00:28,562 --> 00:00:30,745observational studies on the one hand,900:00:31,009 --> 00:00:34,457and experimental or intervention studies on the other.1000:00:35,026 --> 00:00:37,288In observational studies,1100:00:37,485 --> 00:00:39,058the researcher takes the measurements1200:00:39,182 --> 00:00:42,748but it's not their intention to intervene and change the situation.1300:00:43,168 --> 00:00:45,365Within intervention studies,1400:00:45,648 --> 00:00:48,423they can be experimental, like a randomized trial1500:00:48,554 --> 00:00:50,727or they can be quasi-experimental1600:00:50,865 --> 00:00:52,431like a before and after design1700:00:52,603 --> 00:00:53,534where you do an intervention1800:00:53,669 --> 00:00:55,433and see how things change from before.1900:00:56,158 --> 00:00:59,061Observational studies tend to be easier and cheaper to carry out,2000:00:59,246 --> 00:01:00,403but without providing,2100:01:00,534 --> 00:01:03,273on the whole, as strong of evidence as experimental ones2200:01:03,720 --> 00:01:06,197and that's quantified in frameworks2300:01:06,247 --> 00:01:09,364like the GRADE guidelines here.2400:01:11,180 --> 00:01:15,565In turn, when WHO made recommendations2500:01:15,995 --> 00:01:18,879then it's been found that they have a higher take up2600:01:18,929 --> 00:01:21,680if the degree of evidence is stronger2700:01:21,831 --> 00:01:22,737in these terms.2800:01:22,918 --> 00:01:27,071Now, in the previous chapter, we saw different kinds of research objectives2900:01:27,294 --> 00:01:30,085and the kinds of research questions that go with them.3000:01:30,309 --> 00:01:32,263In this slide and the next few ones,3100:01:32,366 --> 00:01:33,759we're going to see what kinds of designs3200:01:33,872 --> 00:01:35,603might be suitable for each kind of objective.3300:01:36,391 --> 00:01:40,244Here, we've got exploratory and descriptive objectives.3400:01:40,724 --> 00:01:43,724By definition, they don't have anything to do with interventions3500:01:43,846 --> 00:01:45,944so observational designs are more suitable.3600:01:46,475 --> 00:01:49,026Now, within observational designs,3700:01:49,214 --> 00:01:52,214there's a range of qualitative and quantitative methods available.3800:01:52,928 --> 00:01:56,694For implementation research, the qualitative ones may be more relevant,3900:01:57,072 --> 00:01:59,138and they include ethnography,4000:01:59,414 --> 00:02:03,015case studies, key informant interviews and focus groups.4100:02:03,719 --> 00:02:07,115Still within exploratory and descriptive objectives,4200:02:07,251 --> 00:02:09,330quantitative methods, such as surveys,4300:02:09,446 --> 00:02:13,075also may be useful in observational designs.4400:02:13,779 --> 00:02:15,672Finally, mixed methods4500:02:15,819 --> 00:02:18,505meaning combinations of qualitative and quantitative methods,4600:02:18,654 --> 00:02:20,294can be used in different combinations.4700:02:20,294 --> 00:02:23,346First one, then the other, or the other way around and so on.4800:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,171Moving on,4900:02:25,283 --> 00:02:27,300the influence kind of objective5000:02:27,425 --> 00:02:30,488is where an interventional design such as a trial is most relevant.5100:02:31,495 --> 00:02:35,091Here, we've got a schematic diagram of a cluster-randomized trial5200:02:35,224 --> 00:02:36,728to evaluate the effectiveness of5300:02:36,829 --> 00:02:38,514eHealth supported patient recruitment5400:02:38,633 --> 00:02:39,599called " TRANSFoRm " 5500:02:39,821 --> 00:02:42,164in primary care research.5600:02:42,869 --> 00:02:45,428It was done in 5 countries5700:02:45,913 --> 00:02:49,160and between them, they included primary care centers5800:02:49,282 --> 00:02:51,621which were the clusters5900:02:52,096 --> 00:02:54,986which were randomized to either the TRANSFoRm arm6000:02:55,431 --> 00:02:57,99820 of them and 20 to the control arm6100:02:58,323 --> 00:02:59,238with the outcomes6200:02:59,464 --> 00:03:02,105being compared between the two arms.6300:03:02,897 --> 00:03:04,910For the explain type of objective,6400:03:05,169 --> 00:03:06,949which we said was more analytic than6500:03:07,052 --> 00:03:09,857the explore or describe objectives,6600:03:10,054 --> 00:03:13,154we might use either an observational or an intervention design.6700:03:13,676 --> 00:03:15,079If an intervention one6800:03:15,283 --> 00:03:17,074then a quasi-experimental design6900:03:17,193 --> 00:03:19,677might be more suitable than an experimental one7000:03:19,804 --> 00:03:21,138like a randomized trial.7100:03:22,167 --> 00:03:24,236Here, we've got an illustration of one kind7200:03:24,356 --> 00:03:25,789of quasi-experimental design7300:03:26,108 --> 00:03:29,830called the before/after or interrupted time series design7400:03:29,969 --> 00:03:31,293and here we've got a quote 7500:03:31,435 --> 00:03:33,222from a paper which argues for the importance7600:03:33,356 --> 00:03:35,703of this design in quality improvement research.7700:03:36,214 --> 00:03:37,448How does it work?7800:03:37,589 --> 00:03:40,308Well, in the figure here,7900:03:40,451 --> 00:03:42,829we've got time on the horizontal axis8000:03:43,008 --> 00:03:45,985and an outcome of interest on the vertical axis.8100:03:46,508 --> 00:03:47,911Let's say, for example, that8200:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,610prior to the intervention8300:03:49,736 --> 00:03:51,336the outcome has got a steady trend8400:03:51,682 --> 00:03:55,441then, we might assume that had we not intervened here,8500:03:55,640 --> 00:03:57,356it would have continued in the same way8600:03:57,422 --> 00:03:58,862and that's the dotted line there.8700:03:59,352 --> 00:04:01,842Well, that's quite an assumption,8800:04:02,138 --> 00:04:05,541and it does make the evidence less strong than if we'd done a randomized trial.8900:04:05,751 --> 00:04:06,704However,9000:04:07,098 --> 00:04:09,434what it lets us do is9100:04:09,955 --> 00:04:12,175compare what actually happened9200:04:12,370 --> 00:04:13,691in the solid line9300:04:14,210 --> 00:04:18,858with the assumed counterfactual data9400:04:18,997 --> 00:04:20,077in the dotted line.9500:04:20,557 --> 00:04:22,496If you remember the research question9600:04:22,615 --> 00:04:23,986about dengue in the previous chapter,9700:04:24,122 --> 00:04:25,298this is how the comparison,9800:04:25,451 --> 00:04:28,152the C component of PICO was made,9900:04:28,642 --> 00:04:32,032before and after the intervention was compared.10000:04:32,695 --> 00:04:35,301Finally, for the predict kind of objective10100:04:35,701 --> 00:04:38,339then observational designs may be more relevant.10200:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,048So the take home message from this chapter10300:04:41,265 --> 00:04:43,110is that the research design10400:04:43,296 --> 00:04:45,649should be determined by the research question10500:04:45,911 --> 00:04:46,822and the objective10600:04:47,098 --> 00:04:48,746and also by the strength of evidence10700:04:48,852 --> 00:04:50,729that it's feasible for you to achieve.
