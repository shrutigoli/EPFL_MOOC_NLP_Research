000:00:04,974 --> 00:00:05,846Welcome back to the course.100:00:06,065 --> 00:00:07,777I'm Neal Alexander200:00:07,882 --> 00:00:10,189I'm based at CIDEIM in Cali in Colombia.300:00:10,709 --> 00:00:13,588The next 2 chapters, this one and the next one,400:00:13,731 --> 00:00:16,990are about how to choose a suitable implementation research design.500:00:17,617 --> 00:00:20,095This chapter is about how to specify600:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,297your research question700:00:21,434 --> 00:00:22,919in connection with the objective800:00:23,126 --> 00:00:27,391and how to use it to specifically address a given health related problem.900:00:27,988 --> 00:00:30,460Then, once you've specified your research question,1000:00:30,600 --> 00:00:34,061the next chapter is about how to use it to develop a research design.1100:00:34,466 --> 00:00:36,349So, what is a research question1200:00:36,501 --> 00:00:37,858and why does it matter?1300:00:38,496 --> 00:00:40,268Well, it's a way of specifying1400:00:40,434 --> 00:00:43,733what it is that you want to have learnt by the end of the research.1500:00:44,194 --> 00:00:46,567It's the next step in the evidence-based approach1600:00:46,702 --> 00:00:49,376after you've identified a health related problem.1700:00:49,888 --> 00:00:53,004It's a way to help select between the wide range of qualitative,1800:00:53,277 --> 00:00:55,254quantitative, and mixed methods1900:00:55,493 --> 00:00:58,029that can be used in implementation research.2000:00:58,702 --> 00:01:00,672You can have different types of research questions2100:01:00,829 --> 00:01:02,418depending on the type of objective.2200:01:02,866 --> 00:01:05,987Suppose the objective is explanatory:2300:01:06,476 --> 00:01:08,621For example, you might have a cervical screening strategy2400:01:08,784 --> 00:01:11,014that isn't reaching all the women who might benefit2500:01:11,190 --> 00:01:13,560and you want to find out what's stopping it from doing so.2600:01:14,058 --> 00:01:16,100Then, you might want to describe2700:01:16,423 --> 00:01:17,920a situation that you know about:2800:01:18,033 --> 00:01:21,412For example, how health teams manage to provide HIV/AIDS treatment2900:01:21,550 --> 00:01:22,608to those who need it.3000:01:22,796 --> 00:01:24,718You might want to influence3100:01:24,841 --> 00:01:26,350something through an intervention:3200:01:26,628 --> 00:01:29,204For example, a package of health insurance benefits.3300:01:29,530 --> 00:01:32,391You might want to know what kind of effect that package has3400:01:32,526 --> 00:01:34,990on access to hospital services.3500:01:35,614 --> 00:01:37,551You might want to explain3600:01:38,134 --> 00:01:40,778a bit like describe but more analytic:3700:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,993For example, understand how community empowerment can lead to3800:01:44,156 --> 00:01:45,004improved sanitation.3900:01:45,511 --> 00:01:48,264Finally, you might want to predict,4000:01:48,381 --> 00:01:50,673meaning thinking of changes into the future4100:01:50,968 --> 00:01:53,366not necessarily predicting in the physical sense:4200:01:53,629 --> 00:01:56,193For example, you might want to know how to expand4300:01:56,342 --> 00:02:00,334use of bed nets to such an extent that malaria transmission is prevented.4400:02:00,806 --> 00:02:03,190To try to develop specific research questions4500:02:03,366 --> 00:02:05,029we identify the key elements4600:02:05,174 --> 00:02:06,750and one way to do that4700:02:07,017 --> 00:02:08,824is via the PICO scheme.4800:02:09,146 --> 00:02:11,667The 'P' is for population,4900:02:11,901 --> 00:02:15,888which, in implementation research, means the stakeholders in the implementation strategy.5000:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,504'I' is for the intervention, or implementation strategy itself...5100:02:20,645 --> 00:02:21,902what does that consist of?5200:02:22,536 --> 00:02:25,349'C' is for control or comparison5300:02:25,643 --> 00:02:28,025What's the alternative to the implementation strategy?5400:02:28,338 --> 00:02:30,918Finally, 'O' is for the outcome.5500:02:31,109 --> 00:02:34,489What do we hope the implementation strategy is going to improve?5600:02:35,462 --> 00:02:37,626For most of the rest of this chapter, we're going to take5700:02:37,788 --> 00:02:39,895an example implementation research question,5800:02:40,045 --> 00:02:41,136break it down,5900:02:41,567 --> 00:02:43,252then make the parts more specific6000:02:43,430 --> 00:02:47,020aiming to refine the question and make it more useful in guiding the design.6100:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,259This particular research question relates to dengue.6200:02:50,567 --> 00:02:53,128In the photo here there's a discarded car tire6300:02:53,458 --> 00:02:56,115which is something that can easily collect rainwater and become6400:02:56,165 --> 00:02:58,299a breeding site for Aedes mosquitoes.6500:02:58,785 --> 00:02:59,912The question is6600:03:00,057 --> 00:03:03,193how can a local health department effectively target breeding sites6700:03:03,367 --> 00:03:05,096of mosquitoes which transmit dengue?6800:03:05,476 --> 00:03:09,170We're going to break it down and see what it contains in terms of the PICO elements.6900:03:09,836 --> 00:03:11,017Here's the question again.7000:03:11,324 --> 00:03:14,755What does it say about the 'P' for population or stakeholders?7100:03:15,384 --> 00:03:18,693Well, first, although the intervention is ultimately aimed at reducing7200:03:18,855 --> 00:03:20,562dengue incidents in the population,7300:03:20,735 --> 00:03:23,936here we're interested in implementation.7400:03:24,102 --> 00:03:29,303So, the who, the 'P' in the PICO, the population or stakeholders,7500:03:29,623 --> 00:03:32,294refers to those who are managing and carrying out the intervention.7600:03:32,821 --> 00:03:35,239Are they mentioned in the current version of the question?7700:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,831Well, no, they're not, but who do you think they could be?7800:03:39,319 --> 00:03:43,120Well, they're likely to be some combination of public servants7900:03:43,244 --> 00:03:44,998like health service or sanitation workers8000:03:45,158 --> 00:03:46,226and the general public8100:03:46,373 --> 00:03:49,884if, for example, the strategy involves mass media messages8200:03:50,018 --> 00:03:52,609aimed at cleaning up discarded containers8300:03:52,762 --> 00:03:54,190which could hold rainwater.8400:03:55,011 --> 00:03:57,965Here's the question again. What about the 'I' for intervention8500:03:58,077 --> 00:03:59,939or implementation strategy?8600:04:00,109 --> 00:04:01,536What does the question say about that?8700:04:01,996 --> 00:04:03,159It does say something.8800:04:03,284 --> 00:04:05,473It says it's  about targeting mosquito breeding sites8900:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,691but it's very general.9000:04:07,274 --> 00:04:10,962We might try to say something about some or all of the following components:9100:04:11,109 --> 00:04:16,118justification, why we're doing this, action and action targets,9200:04:16,247 --> 00:04:19,747temporality or time, and dose or how much.9300:04:20,186 --> 00:04:22,394This is following the paper by Proctor and others9400:04:22,507 --> 00:04:26,968whose scheme also contains components covered under the 'P' and 'O' of PICO.9500:04:27,464 --> 00:04:28,944Following up those components,9600:04:29,112 --> 00:04:30,859in terms of justification,9700:04:31,017 --> 00:04:33,894prior work found that controlled measures were subject to limitations9800:04:33,951 --> 00:04:36,813such as lack of training and high turnover of personnel9900:04:36,954 --> 00:04:39,461and concentration on national guidelines10000:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,123over local conditions.10100:04:41,767 --> 00:04:44,494Action and action targets therefore included10200:04:44,647 --> 00:04:47,694training of sanitation technicians and other personnel10300:04:48,027 --> 00:04:51,954and identifying the key breeding sites and targeting them.10400:04:52,532 --> 00:04:55,515Storm drains, rather than domestic containers10500:04:55,792 --> 00:04:57,242were found to be dominant10600:04:57,644 --> 00:05:00,247and they were targeted with pyriproxyfen10700:05:00,382 --> 00:05:02,400which is an insect growth regulator.10800:05:04,130 --> 00:05:07,330So, now we're on to 'C' for control or comparison.10900:05:07,603 --> 00:05:09,801What does the question say about that?11000:05:10,977 --> 00:05:13,764Well, no, it doesn't really say anything about11100:05:13,839 --> 00:05:15,653what the intervention will be compared with.11200:05:16,097 --> 00:05:18,233We'll come back to this briefly in the next chapter11300:05:18,295 --> 00:05:20,466but you might consider doing a trial,11400:05:20,634 --> 00:05:23,227which would give you a nearby control group11500:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,306at the same time,11600:05:24,451 --> 00:05:26,645or, a before/after comparison.11700:05:27,790 --> 00:05:29,975Finally, what about the 'O' for outcome?11800:05:30,122 --> 00:05:32,318What does the question tell us about that as it stands?11900:05:32,783 --> 00:05:35,686Well, the question mentions effectively targeting breeding sites.12000:05:36,107 --> 00:05:39,503In terms of implementation research, we might consider the following aspects:12100:05:39,894 --> 00:05:43,005acceptability, adoption,12200:05:43,147 --> 00:05:45,759whether people actually follow the strategy,12300:05:46,236 --> 00:05:49,004appropriateness, feasibility,12400:05:49,198 --> 00:05:51,174fidelity, meaning, for example,12500:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,281are the key breeding sites being correctly identified?12600:05:55,100 --> 00:05:59,148Cost of the implementation: is the new strategy more expensive?12700:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,439Penetration, which could mean whether the key breeding sites12800:06:03,546 --> 00:06:05,774are actually being treated with pyriproxyfen.12900:06:06,147 --> 00:06:07,458Finally, sustainability.13000:06:08,288 --> 00:06:11,272So, a refined question might be as follows: 13100:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,271This version has got more about the 'P'13200:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,580for population or stakeholders,13300:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,447the 'I' for intervention13400:06:19,597 --> 00:06:21,836or the implementation strategy itself,13500:06:22,305 --> 00:06:24,800and the 'O' for outcome,13600:06:25,428 --> 00:06:28,345and we'll see a bit more about the 'C' for control or comparison13700:06:28,487 --> 00:06:29,633in the next chapter.13800:06:30,405 --> 00:06:31,843That's the end of this chapter13900:06:31,985 --> 00:06:34,519closing on this quote which says that14000:06:34,669 --> 00:06:37,441in implementation research, as in other fields,14100:06:37,571 --> 00:06:39,072the research question is king.14200:06:39,888 --> 00:06:42,233We've got an additional video,14300:06:42,463 --> 00:06:45,110an interview with the vector-born disease coordinator14400:06:45,235 --> 00:06:48,236in the town where that dengue vector study was done,14500:06:48,731 --> 00:06:51,731and I'll be back in the next chapter.
