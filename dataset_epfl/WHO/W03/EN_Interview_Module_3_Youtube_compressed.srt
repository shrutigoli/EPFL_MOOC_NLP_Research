00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:34,000
Hello Jorge!

12
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,689
Hello professor Maria do 
Rosario, it is a great pleasure to be

13
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:40,884
here to talk about the study 
that was conducted in Mozambique.

14
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:46,710
Very well. Let us now 
start by describing

15
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:50,500
precisely the context 
in which this study was carried out.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,010
We will talk a little about the 
characteristics of the

17
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,220
region where the study was conducted.

18
00:00:56,210 --> 00:01:00,080
Well, the study was done 
in Mozambique, so

19
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:04,030
in the Central region of the country.
It is therefore a region which has a

20
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,480
high prevalence of 
malaria, and the study  was conducted

21
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,400
in two 
provinces, that beyond

22
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,050
the high prevalence of 
malaria, also are characterized by being located in

23
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,724
rural settings where

24
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:24,050
the sanitation system 
is not very good.

25
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,810
So access to a 
health facility is

26
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:32,070
relatively low, 
in other words, people,

27
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:36,750
the population, have travelled 
huge distances to


28
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,000
have access to 
basic health services.

29
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,300
Very well. So let's now 
move to the next phase.


30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:48,730
I imagine that before 
these new  startegies


31
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:51,690
were implemented,  a situation anlysis was conducted


32
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:55,450
 with various actors,


33
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,450
and that it reached some conclusions.

34
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,370
So tell us a bit about
how this was done


35
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,620
and what were the 
main problems that were


36
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,840
raised in this analysis?

37
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,790
Well, a situational analysis 
was conducted involving


38
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,050
various stakeholders, 
including the health ministry


39
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:16,690
and its offices
at the local and


40
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,470
district level, so in addition to 
these actors, there were also


41
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:26,190
health partners involved,

42
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:29,560
as well as non-governmental 
organisations (including one to which


43
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,340
I belong, which is called World 
Vision), and there was also the


44
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:37,100
involvement of
community leaders,


45
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,590
and community structures,
such as actors


46
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:44,370
actively involved 
in the process

47
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:45,400
of distribution of mosquito nets.

48
00:02:46,060 --> 00:02:49,150
Okay, so what were the 
main conclusions reached?


49
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,550
Well, during this 
situational analysis,


50
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:00,320
three main conclusions



51
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,000
stood out. The first is 
related to the actual

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,390
process of 
household registration, so


53
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:11,930
one of the key steps is to 
register all families


54
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,360
that exist in that 
area, and it was noted that


55
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,240
this process was highly 
complex, with the registration forms


56
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,670
for registration of households
requiring various details


57
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:26,680
related to the 
household, such as


58
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:30,530
for example, the name of each 
household member,


59
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,350
age, gender ... This 
made things a little difficult,


60
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:37,720
making the registration process very complex.

61
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,490
The other issue related 
to the registration itself had


62
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:46,210
to do with the fact that there is 
the possibility of duplicate


63
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:49,230
household registrations 
because the houses were not


64
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,460
identified, and/or conversely, 
it was also possible


65
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,720
that a particular household was not registered


66
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:01,680
And the second important 
aspect of the


67
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:06,750
situation analysis  
relates to the process of


68
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:10,550
allocating mosquito nets 
for each family,


69
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:15,290
which was complex. It required a 
rather complex manner of


70
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,950
distribution of the net 
per household, and finally


71
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:23,500
there was also the need to

72
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,670
evaluate the distribution process itself, 
reaching the conclusion that


73
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,750
people were spending 
a long, long time


74
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:34,320
queuing to get 
their mosquito nets.


75
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,580
So the issue of 
registration of these households,


76
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:44,670
the long queues, 
and the


77
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:47,890
 criteria for allocation of 
 number of mosquito nets per household were


78
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:52,367
the three key aspects that 
stood out in this situation analysis.

79
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,820
I therefore imagine that for this 
process to be implemented,


80
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,030
several stages are needed.
I would like you to tell us a little


81
00:05:00,230 --> 00:05:04,580
about all these stages
that took place, that have thus been


82
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:07,480
developed so that 
the new strategies


83
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,060
could finally be implemented.



84
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,460
Well, the very
process of distribution of

85
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:19,200
mosquito nets has several 
stages and in the first stage


86
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:23,420
it was necessary to build the 
capacity of health authorities,

87
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:28,900
so that 
district staff are

88
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:33,630
trained. They, in turn, 
after this training

89
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:37,220
would replicate the 
training itself to others

90
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,370
at the district level,
in order to strengthen 


91
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,800
the district team.

92
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,800
Community leaders were also involved,

93
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,330
they were selected 
for a particular locality place

94
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:57,830
in the  region or  neighbourhood, 
and the volunteers for


95
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,000
the registration process 
of household were selected in the same way.


96
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:03,570
It was important to mobilize people from the
community, because they are 


97
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:08,000
better  accepted  and the

98
00:06:08,430 --> 00:06:12,710
households open up
their doors easily 


99
00:06:12,910 --> 00:06:15,160
to them, 
trust them more.

100
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:20,950
And these registrars - 
they are called registrars - are


101
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:25,816
trained too,
they provide


102
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:30,230
coupons and a 
sticker to identify


103
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,490
the homes that have been registered,
and coupons ensure that


104
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:37,300
at the end, the families go 
to a certain distribution point


105
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:41,240
and receive a 
number of nets



106
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,510
and all this information is then 
compiled and the date of

107
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,900
distribution is registered 
at the closest distribution point 

108
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:54,550
for that community, and



109
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,270
families go there with 
coupons and take the mosquito nets

110
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:02,030
and these are 
generally the


111
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,100
stages of the
distribution process


112
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,180
with the new model.

113
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:12,310
From what I understood, this new 
model has three innovative aspects, is that right?

114
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:17,420
On the one hand,  the 
mechanisms for assigning the number of

115
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:22,150
nets per family is simplified, while 
on the other hand, a coupon is introduced in the


116
00:07:22,350 --> 00:07:27,120
process  that ensures 
a more accurate identification of the


117
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,850
families when they 
get their nets, so 


118
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:33,200
the long queues are no more present.

119
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:39,170
And on the other hand,
 also the fact of having a


120
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,880
sticker meant that 
there were no such


121
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:47,783
over-registrations or 
under-registrations of households, is that it?

122
00:07:47,821 --> 00:07:50,820
It was, it was

140
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,690
All right, you already told us 
about these three innovative aspects,


141
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:59,540
but I am sure people  who are listening to us
are curious,  


142
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,480
 about the way it works and 


143
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,340 about details on the logistic of ,

144
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:09,300
this new distribution .

145
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:13,610
Can you explain in more 
detail then the format


146
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,000
of the coupon and the information 
that was in this coupon and also what

147
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:21,58
 is the main  difference that 
 exists between the


148
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:24,560
old method that was more 
complex,  namely because 


149
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:27,920
of distribution of nets to families 
 was  based on a complex, formula

150
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,080
and now this new method 
that is much simpler?


151
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,390
Can you explain then 
why it is so important to provide guidance,


152
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:35,900
why these are the 
most important strategies of your study?

153
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,180
Exactly. So the coupon
has the two parts,


154
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:46,210
the part  on 
the left side of the coupon, which


155
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:50,550
stays with the registrars 
and the team involved in


156
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,800
the process of distribution, and 
on the aprt on the right side


157
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,790
given to the family, it has


158
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,300
basic information about the 
address of the household,


159
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,000
so basically the
 residence, residential area


160
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:10,520
the number of household 
members, this is very


161
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:15,540
important because the 
first changes were made


162
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:19,340
in order to allow a 
net to be assigned for each


163
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:23,660
household and 
basically the formula was the number of


164
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,700
household members 
divided by two and


165
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:29,340
rounded up 
to a integer number.


166
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:32,120
This is the new method, isn't it?

167
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,370
And what was the previous method like, can you explain?

168
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,520
The old formula would, 
after harvesting data about


169
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:43,030
the age, gender, and 
number of members

170
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:48,030
of the household, 
try to find out the sleep patterns


171
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:52,850
so that
a family, for example,that 


172
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,890
is composed of 
three household members


173
00:10:57,090 --> 00:11:01,660
may receive 
one net, two nets,


174
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:06,690
or three nets. For 
example, with the old model of


175
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,210
distribution, a 
family with a father,

176
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:14,010
a mother and a two-year-old child 
would receive one net because

177
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:17,240
it was assumed that 
they all slept together.


178
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,140
However, if in this 
family the child was ten


179
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:26,270
years old, they would receive
two nets because the father and


180
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:29,820
mother would sleep together and 
the son would sleep separately.

181
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:33,940
However if this family 
had a father,


182
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:39,300
a grandfather, 
and another child who is twenty years old,


183
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,717
it would not be possible for the father 
to sleep in the same space,

184
00:11:43,868 --> 00:11:48,150
in the same bed, as, say, the 
grandfather and also the son


185
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:51,400
who is twenty years old, they would have 
had to receive three mosquito nets.


186
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,650
So there were three 
situations for the same situation, three

187
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,840
possibilities for the allocation of 
mosquito nets for the


188
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,730
same 
household composition.

189
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,020
This is changing with the new 
approach so it is


190
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:06,420
simply the number of 
households divided


191
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:10,850
by two, with the 
aim of having a mosquito net



192
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:13,320
for every two persons.


200
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,240
The innovation was alos in the coupons and the stickers , the stickers


201
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,140
 had basic information 
so in terms of


202
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:52,230
location of the 
neighbourhood, of the community and


203
00:12:52,430 --> 00:12:54,840
informing that the 
house was already registered.


204
00:12:55,570 --> 00:13:00,440
And it was attached to the main door 
of the house, the hut,


205
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:04,840
I think the best example 
is the hut, which is


206
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,100
the rural context of the 
communities where we worked and


207
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,020
tested the new model.


214
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:37,330
So when the
supervisors of the registration


215
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:40,400
process came to a 
particular community and saw that


216
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:45,200
there were houses that did not 
have the sticker already, we could


217
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,330
assume in principle that in fact 
these homes were not registered.


218
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,920
So it was already
easier to deploy a specific team


219
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,781
to that community for 
the registration of those families.


220
00:13:57,096 --> 00:13:59,000
Thank you very much. So 
now that we have spoken, no?


221
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,200
about this new strategy 
that was used, let's talk a


222
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,680
little bit about the study design. OKt?

223
00:14:05,310 --> 00:14:08,060
So we have talked about
the research question and now


224
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,300
we know that for the  specific research
question  there is a research design


225
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,360
more suitable, no?

226
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:17,510
We therefore need to talk a little bit 
about the research design.


227
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:20,950
Okay. For this study you

228
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:25,380
use a resaerch design with a qualitative

229
00:14:25,730 --> 00:14:28,230
component and 
a quantitative component.


230
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,800
 A qualitative 
 study was conducted at each


231
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,810
phases of the project, therefore 
for the process of


232
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:41,530
delivery of mosquito nets 
 we conducted focus groups


233
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:46,020
with key actors.

234
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:51,300
And the goal was to try 
to reap as much information


235
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:54,270
about how it had happened, 
in that particular


236
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,940
phase, or all phases, 
the pros and cons of


237
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,260
each stage, 
in order to be more adequate the


238
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:06,710
interventions. In the quantitative component, 


239
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,340
the study was 
a

240
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:15,790
 quasi experimental  study
in where we had a district that was


241
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,730
an intervention district 
in which the new model


242
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:23,660
for distribution was followed, 
so a net for every two


243
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:28,590
persons, use of 
coupons, use of stickers



244
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:33,730
for the identification 
of the houses, while


245
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,240
having a control group.

246
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,800
So the district with the 
control rules, that had

247
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,650
the previous intervention techniques, 
so those complex

248
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:48,830
registration criteria, and rules for allocation

249
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,220
of mosquito nets 
per household.


250
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:57,310
We tried as much as possible to have 
something comparable from one district


251
00:15:57,510 --> 00:15:59,220
to the other, so 
in terms of rural


252
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:04,470
characteristics and even 
in terms of the people


253
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:08,110
who are benefiting or 
would benefit from mosquito nets.


254
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:12,000
Okay, one question 
I wanted to ask is that


255
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,340
in this qualitative study, or rather, 
in the qualitative part of the study,


256
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,190
focus groups with key actors were conducted and 
then came to a conclusion.

257
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:21,300
You then change the 
process according to


258
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:24,660
what people had stated? 
Can you give an example?



264
00:16:46,730 --> 00:16:50,750
It was noted that the 
characteristics of the coupons


265
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,820
that had been made
 were not most appropriate and


266
00:16:56,020 --> 00:17:00,450
resistant, taking into account 
where the family


267
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:03,190
would store the coupons.

268
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:08,250
Consequently in the next district where


269
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:12,000
the pilot study was  going to be conducted, 
we improved

270
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:16,900
the quality of the coupons,
a bit more.

271
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:21,750
And this was, for example, 
one of the lessons


272
00:17:21,950 --> 00:17:26,600
that we could quickly 
recognize as positive factor


273
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:30,380
for the successful implementation and applied it  
in another intervention district.


280
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,760
Very well. We're almost 
coming to an end, no?

281
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,540
And now  that we have defined  
 the strategies?


282
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,790
 that we have  already  presented  the 
research design,


283
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:09,720

It is time to test the new model and as we will see


284
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,330
 we already have some results.

285
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,350
Can you tell us a little about 
just what has been


286
00:18:14,550 --> 00:18:16,800
done on this pilot study, 
and what were the


287
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,000
main conclusions 
reached in this study?


288
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,510
First in terms of 
outcomes used to measure


289
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:29,290
the results of this 
study.


290
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:34,610
 First 
the percentage of mosquito nets


291
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:39,410
distributed  when compared



292
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:43,660
to what was planned. And  also
to the coverage of nets

293
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:46,580
in the households, 
in families.


294
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:52,800
And what we observed,  the result


295
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,790
of the implementation , was that after five


296
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,660
days, so 
in the first calculation, the first


297
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,820
result, the 
percentage of mosquito nets



298
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:09,920
distributed using the new

299
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:14,670
distribution model 
was higher compared to

300
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:21,515
the previous model.  
With the new approach it was 88%

301
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:27,120
against 77% in the control model.

302
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,690
And this difference was 
statistically significant, no?


303
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:35,370
This difference was 
statistically significant, yes.

304
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:39,060
Regarding the coverage of 
households in terms of


305
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:42,300
mosquito nets in households, 
at the end


306
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,320
of the five days, 
which is the period of


307
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,440
implementation of distribution of 
mosquito nets, there was a


308
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:55,390
difference between the 
group, the district where


309
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:59,450
the new model was implemented,
 and the district


310
00:19:59,650 --> 00:20:03,580
with the previous mode. 
so in the new model with innovative strategies,


311
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:09,000
 
the coverage was


312
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,660
greater, about 81% in relation to



313
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:19,510
the coverage in the district with the 
previous model, which was 73%.

314
00:20:19,710 --> 00:20:23,500
And this difference was also 
statistically significant.


315
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:27,820
Yes, there is just one more thing I want to say, 
to ask: when


316
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:30,260
did this study  took place.



317
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:33,180
It is important to have the


318
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,850
time-frame in which this study was conducted?

319
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:40,120
So the study 
took off last year,

320
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:45,100
so in 2015.
In 2015 in the period from October to


321
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,120
December 2015,



322
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,820
and results  already available in
 in

323
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:59,300
January for detailed analysis


324
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,590
And now we need to follow the next steps.

325
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:06,540
True. What are the 
next steps?


326
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:08,670
These results  were presented to the



327
00:21:08,870 --> 00:21:13,740
Ministry of Health and to various


328
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:17,720
sectors  involved in 
the distribution process in the


329
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,710
provinces and districts concerned.

330
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:25,500
And the  Ministry of Health
has adopted this new


331
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:29,210
strategy for a 
massive distribution process


332
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:33,090
of nets at national level.
Which in the first phase will be


333
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:36,730
an implementation on a 
wide scale so


334
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:39,730
northern provinces of 
Mozambique, in particular


335
00:21:39,930 --> 00:21:43,270
the Nampula province which will 
be held  in 2016.


344
00:22:10,771 --> 00:22:16,790
Okay. So thank you 
all for being here


345
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,690
today, to close this  part of module 3.

346
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:25,190
I hope you 
enjoyed it and see you soon!
