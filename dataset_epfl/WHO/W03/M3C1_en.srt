000:00:04,488 --> 00:00:07,326Hello, welcome to module 3.100:00:07,677 --> 00:00:10,489My name is Maria Rosário Martins,200:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,682and I am professor of statistics  and research methods300:00:17,545 --> 00:00:19,432 in the Institute of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Lisbon, Portugal.400:00:19,664 --> 00:00:22,376 And I am also the coordinator of this module.500:00:22,627 --> 00:00:26,314 Today my topic is on the definition and specification600:00:26,579 --> 00:00:28,504 of implementation strategy.700:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,995 This is the first talk in the series that will discuss in detail800:00:33,220 --> 00:00:36,220the design of an implementation strategy.900:00:37,115 --> 00:00:39,902Let me begin by giving you an overview of1000:00:40,116 --> 00:00:41,891what I want to cover today.1100:00:42,518 --> 00:00:46,518 I'm going first to introduce you to a real life example,1200:00:46,747 --> 00:00:50,059 related to bed nets delivery  in Mozambique.1300:00:50,998 --> 00:00:55,773 Then, I am going to talk about two possible definitions1400:00:55,994 --> 00:01:00,532 for implementation strategy  together with real life examples.1500:01:00,959 --> 00:01:06,534And finally, I'm going to present 5 important dimensions1600:01:07,091 --> 00:01:09,428that are very useful in the description1700:01:09,646 --> 00:01:11,984 of implementation strategy.1800:01:12,523 --> 00:01:16,885 So, the fundamental point that drives this segment1900:01:17,095 --> 00:01:22,733 is that implementation strategies description must be very precise.2000:01:23,652 --> 00:01:28,377 This explanation must allow us  to measure the different components2100:01:28,595 --> 00:01:32,408of the strategy, and also  to reproduce it.2200:01:33,534 --> 00:01:38,521 At the end of this chapter we hope that you will be able to2300:01:38,828 --> 00:01:42,353identify the different types  of implementation strategies,2400:01:42,652 --> 00:01:47,239 to specify the different types of implementation strategies,2500:01:47,499 --> 00:01:50,624 and to use these concepts in real life examples2600:01:50,867 --> 00:01:53,479 related to diseases of poverty.2700:01:53,784 --> 00:01:57,121Let us begin our lecture  by presenting an example2800:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,605 related to the bed net delivery in Mozambique.2900:02:01,302 --> 00:02:03,602 So, what is the problem?3000:02:04,261 --> 00:02:08,099Malaria is considered the most important public health problem3100:02:08,308 --> 00:02:09,520 in Mozambique.3200:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,520It is the leading cause of mortality3300:02:12,750 --> 00:02:18,325 with 35% of children aged under 5 years testing positive3400:02:18,533 --> 00:02:21,883for malaria parasites in 2011.3500:02:22,755 --> 00:02:26,968Moreover, in these children malaria accounts for3600:02:27,287 --> 00:02:29,92542% of deaths.3700:02:30,422 --> 00:02:35,797 In addition, we also know that malaria prevalence is different3800:02:36,060 --> 00:02:41,123 across the regions with very small figures in the capital Maputo,3900:02:41,467 --> 00:02:46,305that is around 1.5%4000:02:47,682 --> 00:02:51,682and it is very, very high in Zambézia4100:02:52,024 --> 00:02:55,461with numbers around 55%.4200:02:56,175 --> 00:02:59,025 And we can all see that in general4300:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,463 prevalence rates are higher  in the North,4400:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,925 and lower in the South.4500:03:05,711 --> 00:03:10,336In terms of coverage, the indicators are also below the target.4600:03:10,596 --> 00:03:12,508 As we can see in this table,4700:03:12,786 --> 00:03:18,448 in 2011 only 36% of children4800:03:18,801 --> 00:03:21,801under 5 slept under a bed net.4900:03:22,048 --> 00:03:26,873Furthermore, only 34% of the pregnant women5000:03:27,129 --> 00:03:29,379slept under the bed nets.5100:03:29,897 --> 00:03:33,272 One can ask, why the different interventions5200:03:33,506 --> 00:03:36,506do not reach the desired outcomes?5300:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,048We have a health problem.5400:03:39,293 --> 00:03:44,430On the other side we know that there are efficacious  interventions.5500:03:44,694 --> 00:03:46,906So, what do we know exactly?5600:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,402 We know that the use of bed nets,5700:03:50,806 --> 00:03:53,218in particular, long lasting nets5800:03:53,485 --> 00:03:55,010are efficacious.5900:03:55,628 --> 00:03:58,303We also know, that the use of bed nets6000:03:58,529 --> 00:04:01,654reduces malaria episodes among children.6100:04:02,246 --> 00:04:07,084 And finally, we also know that the use of treated bed nets6200:04:07,352 --> 00:04:08,965is cost effective,6300:04:09,183 --> 00:04:11,808namely, the long lasting ones.6400:04:12,452 --> 00:04:16,752However, there is still a low coverage in Mozambique.6500:04:17,509 --> 00:04:18,959 So, again...6600:04:19,351 --> 00:04:22,901There is an efficacious intervention.6700:04:23,864 --> 00:04:27,151 But, there is an implementation problem.6800:04:27,572 --> 00:04:31,535We need to develop or to design strategies6900:04:31,884 --> 00:04:36,021 in order to improve the bed nets used7000:04:36,218 --> 00:04:38,255 by the population in need.7100:04:38,857 --> 00:04:42,907 As conclusion, we know that the use of bed nets7200:04:43,325 --> 00:04:46,400 reduces malaria transmission rates.7300:04:46,956 --> 00:04:50,856 But, we need more research into the most effective7400:04:51,100 --> 00:04:55,663and sustainable way to deliver those bed nets7500:04:56,236 --> 00:04:59,899and to assure that they are properly used.7600:05:00,613 --> 00:05:04,213 But one can ask, what are the reasons for this failure?7700:05:04,899 --> 00:05:09,224 The literature identifies several reasons for this failure.7800:05:09,840 --> 00:05:13,328On one hand, there are several issues related to7900:05:13,631 --> 00:05:16,044supply chain  in the countries,8000:05:16,361 --> 00:05:21,274that don't have a formal system for routing distribution.8100:05:22,230 --> 00:05:27,055On the other hand, in Mozambique there are poor road conditions.8200:05:27,946 --> 00:05:32,396As we can see in the map, Mozambique is a very large country,8300:05:32,694 --> 00:05:36,969and many districts are not accessible during the rainy season.8400:05:37,469 --> 00:05:41,469 Finally, there are also issues related to the poor8500:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,660 information management systems8600:05:43,946 --> 00:05:48,684 to detect shortages and stock-outs of malaria products.8700:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,867 So, we have a research question,8800:05:53,428 --> 00:05:56,965and we need to develop effective solutions8900:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,749 for the problem related to  implementation.9000:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,795 As we already know, that  in the first phase9100:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,983we need to identify the problem  and its context.9200:06:10,302 --> 00:06:12,840And then, the second phase9300:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,783 is related to the design  of the implementation strategies.9400:06:17,746 --> 00:06:21,258But, what is an implementation strategy?9500:06:21,802 --> 00:06:27,415 Well, it is not easy to find in  the literature a consensus about9600:06:27,622 --> 00:06:31,109a definition of an  implementation strategy.9700:06:31,394 --> 00:06:35,707 Perhaps the main challenge in  defining implementation strategy9800:06:35,932 --> 00:06:42,157is that implementation research  draws insight and techniques9900:06:42,387 --> 00:06:46,250from a range of disciplines, including economics,10000:06:46,484 --> 00:06:51,334management, social psychology, behaviour science,10100:06:51,629 --> 00:06:53,217 and applied statistics.10200:06:53,647 --> 00:06:58,097And of course, each discipline  comes with its own techniques,10300:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,451norms and jargon.10400:07:01,043 --> 00:07:04,381 Here we are going to present 2  possible definitions10500:07:04,611 --> 00:07:06,461for implementation strategy.10600:07:07,313 --> 00:07:10,913The first one is based on the paper by Proctor10700:07:11,173 --> 00:07:13,461 and colleagues in 201310800:07:13,797 --> 00:07:18,409 where implementation strategies are defined as methods10900:07:18,667 --> 00:07:24,230or techniques used to enhance the adoption, implementation,11000:07:24,479 --> 00:07:29,279 and sustainability of a clinical programme or practice.11100:07:31,035 --> 00:07:33,247 So, let's give an example.11200:07:33,495 --> 00:07:36,920An implementation strategy used to improve the coverage11300:07:37,151 --> 00:07:42,326and quality of immunization programs is supervision lists.11400:07:43,256 --> 00:07:46,456Another important definition is the following:11500:07:46,902 --> 00:07:50,552 implementation strategies can be defined as strategies11600:07:50,784 --> 00:07:56,472 needed to deliver or implement the products or interventions.11700:07:57,361 --> 00:08:01,611Let's illustrate this concept with a real life example.11800:08:02,043 --> 00:08:05,805 In Module One, Professor Oladele Akogun   described a very interesting implementation research project11900:08:10,017 --> 00:08:12,504related to home management  of malaria.12000:08:12,738 --> 00:08:13,825 Do you remember?12100:08:14,031 --> 00:08:17,631 One of the specific objectives of this study12200:08:17,971 --> 00:08:22,496 was to assess whether bringing  information, education,12300:08:22,707 --> 00:08:27,045 communication activities and  prepackaged drugs12400:08:27,425 --> 00:08:30,325closer to where people live,12500:08:30,554 --> 00:08:33,391improves the compliance for caregivers12600:08:33,675 --> 00:08:35,963 with treatment for childhood fevers.12700:08:36,953 --> 00:08:41,328In this study, the following  strategies were developed:12800:08:42,128 --> 00:08:47,353 training community-based providers  in Home Management of Malaria,12900:08:48,571 --> 00:08:52,046supply of pre-packaging of antimalarial13000:08:52,579 --> 00:08:55,454closer to where people live.13100:08:56,643 --> 00:09:02,705 And also, the use of the colours  and pictures on the pre-packs13200:09:02,992 --> 00:09:08,705with messages to help caregivers to recognize the appropriate treatment. Another example is related to the development13300:09:14,066 --> 00:09:19,141 of intervention specific tools for malaria control in schools.13400:09:19,664 --> 00:09:22,852Implementation strategies are very important13500:09:23,086 --> 00:09:25,698 in implementation research. Why?13600:09:25,992 --> 00:09:29,492Because they represent the "How to" component13700:09:29,740 --> 00:09:35,890 of changing health service delivery in low and middle income countries.13800:09:36,153 --> 00:09:37,266So, don't forget...13900:09:38,056 --> 00:09:41,568Implementation strategies are  related14000:09:41,811 --> 00:09:47,011 to the "How To" component.14100:09:47,666 --> 00:09:51,554Now that we have defined implementation strategy,14200:09:51,855 --> 00:09:54,693and that we have presented  some examples14300:09:55,113 --> 00:10:01,100 let's come back to the identification  of different types of implementation strategy.14400:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,671 In previous examples,14500:10:03,994 --> 00:10:08,056 we saw that the complexity of implementation strategies14600:10:08,578 --> 00:10:10,003 can be very different.14700:10:10,587 --> 00:10:15,187A very simple strategy is the intervention specific toolkit14800:10:15,618 --> 00:10:18,618 for malaria control in schools.14900:10:18,934 --> 00:10:20,784Other examples include:15000:10:21,032 --> 00:10:24,882 local needs assessments, stakeholders consultations,15100:10:25,256 --> 00:10:27,856community visits and meetings.15200:10:28,563 --> 00:10:33,563Well, in this case when only one strategy is developed15300:10:33,876 --> 00:10:38,576it is usual to call it a discreet or single component strategy.15400:10:39,099 --> 00:10:43,149Now, be very careful because in some publications15500:10:43,661 --> 00:10:46,974they are also called  implementation interventions,15600:10:47,239 --> 00:10:48,539 or actions.15700:10:49,343 --> 00:10:55,018Now, let's consider the situation where several strategies15800:10:55,273 --> 00:10:56,448 are combined.15900:10:56,945 --> 00:11:02,670In this case it is called a multi-faceted implementation strategy.16000:11:04,149 --> 00:11:09,211 An example is training, consultation, audit and feedback.16100:11:10,003 --> 00:11:14,478 There are also some implementation frameworks that include16200:11:14,804 --> 00:11:17,679 a number of discreet implementation strategies16300:11:18,209 --> 00:11:20,347combined in a specific way.16400:11:20,713 --> 00:11:24,538 One of these models is  the Replicating Effective16500:11:24,784 --> 00:11:26,384 Programmes framework.16600:11:26,872 --> 00:11:30,185 This model provides a roadmap  for implementing16700:11:30,425 --> 00:11:34,638evidence based intervention  into communities based settings16800:11:34,865 --> 00:11:40,128through a combination of several  strategies in order to maximize16900:11:40,395 --> 00:11:43,758the chances of sustainable interventions.17000:11:44,552 --> 00:11:48,789The model includes a number of discreet implementations17100:11:49,098 --> 00:11:52,098 strategies across 4 phases.17200:11:52,837 --> 00:11:56,887 The first phase, is  Pre-Conditions.17300:11:57,416 --> 00:12:00,916 The second phase, is the  Pre-Implementation.17400:12:02,282 --> 00:12:05,769 The third phase, is  Implementation.17500:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,558 And the last phase is the  Maintenance and Evolution.17600:12:10,183 --> 00:12:15,071Examples of strategies included on each of these phases17700:12:15,346 --> 00:12:18,446are represented in this figure.17800:12:18,870 --> 00:12:22,833We saw that in the Replicating EffectiveProgrammes model,17900:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,000implementations strategies are classified according to phases.18000:12:28,614 --> 00:12:32,839Another approach is to group the implementation strategies18100:12:33,191 --> 00:12:37,728in terms of the actor or the stakeholder using them.18200:12:38,150 --> 00:12:41,825Usually implementation strategies include:18300:12:42,773 --> 00:12:47,973 enhancing the capabilities  of government,18400:12:49,118 --> 00:12:55,255 improving the performance of provider organizations.18500:12:56,907 --> 00:12:59,595But they include also,18600:13:00,131 --> 00:13:06,856strengthening the capabilities and  performance of individual providers.18700:13:09,180 --> 00:13:14,880 They include also empowering  communities and households.18800:13:16,454 --> 00:13:22,329 And finally, they also are related to supporting multiple stakeholders18900:13:22,611 --> 00:13:27,011engaged in improving health.19000:13:28,546 --> 00:13:31,034 This information can be organized in a table19100:13:31,492 --> 00:13:35,054where the first column corresponds  to the main actor19200:13:35,630 --> 00:13:39,630 and the second column corresponds to the implementation strategies.19300:13:40,814 --> 00:13:44,201There are some examples of  implementation strategies19400:13:44,563 --> 00:13:46,901at different stakeholder levels.19500:13:47,649 --> 00:13:49,324 At the government level,19600:13:49,716 --> 00:13:55,066policy reviews are usual implementation strategies.19700:13:57,237 --> 00:13:59,462 At the community level,19800:14:00,051 --> 00:14:03,964 training and community mobilization19900:14:04,406 --> 00:14:07,843 are frequently implementation  strategies.20000:14:08,136 --> 00:14:13,399 Finally, situation analysis is a very good example20100:14:13,705 --> 00:14:17,980related to multiple actors implementation strategies.20200:14:20,084 --> 00:14:23,834 Now, let's go back to the example related to20300:14:24,252 --> 00:14:26,477Home Management of Malaria.20400:14:27,018 --> 00:14:32,143One of the strategies was to conduct a situation analysis,20500:14:32,672 --> 00:14:37,385and this situation analysis was used to develop20600:14:37,674 --> 00:14:40,749 a better understanding of community process20700:14:40,995 --> 00:14:44,183and community perception of  the use of pre-packs20800:14:44,429 --> 00:14:46,804for treating fevers in children.20900:14:47,336 --> 00:14:51,749 Also, to document community  concepts of ill health21000:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,530and perception of malaria treatment seeking behaviour,21100:14:55,927 --> 00:15:01,015 and to identify channels for  communicating health information.21200:15:01,589 --> 00:15:05,914 The situation analysis was also very useful to document   drug names, design of pre-packs and different age groups,21300:15:11,857 --> 00:15:14,944 nature of packing, etc.21400:15:15,486 --> 00:15:18,599In this case, what are the main actors?21500:15:19,501 --> 00:15:23,838 Yes, the main actors are multiple actors.21600:15:26,329 --> 00:15:30,704Another strategy was training  community based providers21700:15:31,143 --> 00:15:34,856 in Home Management of Malaria.21800:15:35,826 --> 00:15:39,201 In this case, what are the main actors?21900:15:40,386 --> 00:15:44,111 Yes, the main actors are  the community.22000:15:46,918 --> 00:15:52,693 Finally, in implementation strategies related to information,22100:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,177 education and communication,22200:15:55,559 --> 00:15:57,347 what are the main actors?22300:15:59,097 --> 00:16:04,559Yes, the main actors are communities and households.22400:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,337As a summary,22500:16:07,675 --> 00:16:11,462 We saw that the actor or the stakeholder22600:16:11,855 --> 00:16:16,455 is an important dimension for implementation strategy specification.22700:16:16,741 --> 00:16:20,266 However, as we will see later on...22800:16:20,605 --> 00:16:22,930 there are other key elements for22900:16:23,180 --> 00:16:25,630implementation strategy specification.23000:16:26,062 --> 00:16:28,962 Namely, the action,23100:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,047 the target,23200:16:31,441 --> 00:16:32,791temporality23300:16:33,621 --> 00:16:34,871 dose,23400:16:35,558 --> 00:16:39,508 implementation outcomes, and justification.23500:16:39,890 --> 00:16:43,690 We are going to be talking about some of these issues23600:16:44,832 --> 00:16:47,619in greater detail over the coming weeks.23700:16:48,287 --> 00:16:52,399 That brings me to the end of what I wanted to cover today.23800:16:52,976 --> 00:16:55,889 So, over the next coming weeks23900:16:56,180 --> 00:16:59,955you are going to be hearing  a lot more about24000:17:00,223 --> 00:17:02,460 each one of these issues.24100:17:03,151 --> 00:17:05,914It's a pleasure to be with you today.24200:17:06,589 --> 00:17:08,739 Thank you for your attention.
