000:00:10,164 --> 00:00:11,152Hello again.100:00:11,334 --> 00:00:14,184Just in case you don't remember, I'm Pascale Allotey200:00:14,367 --> 00:00:15,655Professor of Public Health300:00:15,855 --> 00:00:18,630at the Jeffrey Cheah School of Medicine and Health Sciences400:00:18,804 --> 00:00:20,829Monash University, Malaysia.500:00:21,031 --> 00:00:22,794Congratulations on working your way600:00:22,964 --> 00:00:25,239through the first four modules of this MOOC700:00:25,428 --> 00:00:27,191on implementation research.800:00:27,378 --> 00:00:31,228In this fifth and final module, I'll start off with a brief recap900:00:31,408 --> 00:00:34,207to help to consolidate the main messages1000:00:34,393 --> 00:00:37,469before handing you over to the coordinators of this module,1100:00:37,667 --> 00:00:40,667Dr. Paul Milligan and Dr. Corinne Merle.1200:00:41,051 --> 00:00:43,288The aim of implementation research1300:00:43,488 --> 00:00:48,137is to determine how to take interventions, tools, or treatments1400:00:48,318 --> 00:00:50,393that have been show to be efficacious1500:00:50,565 --> 00:00:52,352under controlled conditions1600:00:52,550 --> 00:00:55,650and make them available to those that need them1700:00:55,881 --> 00:01:00,769and to ensure that the systems are in place to support sustainability.1800:01:01,042 --> 00:01:04,042We focus particularly on infectious diseases of poverty1900:01:04,498 --> 00:01:06,760in this MOOC because2000:01:06,955 --> 00:01:10,167they remain significant causes of morbidity and mortality2100:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,422in resource poor settings,2200:01:12,632 --> 00:01:17,407public health efforts for control require participation at all levels2300:01:17,609 --> 00:01:20,846and poverty and other social determinants of health2400:01:21,026 --> 00:01:23,976have a major impact on access to health,2500:01:24,190 --> 00:01:26,840healthcare, and treatment options.2600:01:27,029 --> 00:01:28,617That not withstanding,2700:01:28,803 --> 00:01:30,966the concepts articulated in this MOOC2800:01:31,171 --> 00:01:34,171will have broader application to implementation research2900:01:34,378 --> 00:01:38,753in other areas of disease control, prevention and health promotion.3000:01:39,073 --> 00:01:43,173In module one, we had Professor Oladele Akogun3100:01:43,369 --> 00:01:47,207and Professor Hans Remme to outline a range of definitions3200:01:47,421 --> 00:01:50,671in conceptual areas in implementation research.3300:01:50,956 --> 00:01:54,781You may recall this diagram, where we explained the need3400:01:54,968 --> 00:01:58,580for rigorous research to determine the strategies required3500:01:58,756 --> 00:02:00,868to ensure that efficacious solutions were actually able to address3600:02:03,286 --> 00:02:05,273the significant health problem.3700:02:05,466 --> 00:02:10,366We used this diagram do describe how implementation research is used3800:02:10,555 --> 00:02:14,405to identify and investigate problems that affect3900:02:14,579 --> 00:02:20,179effective implementation and develop and test implementation strategies.4000:02:20,376 --> 00:02:25,738Hans explains that implementation research involves three major phases.4100:02:25,959 --> 00:02:28,122The first is defining the problem.4200:02:28,307 --> 00:02:31,282The first phase requires an understanding of the context,4300:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,460identifying the problems that arise within that context4400:02:34,885 --> 00:02:38,285and identifying possible strategies or possible solutions4500:02:38,469 --> 00:02:40,069to address these problems.4600:02:44,044 --> 00:02:46,932Phase 2 involves the design of the strategy and this needs to be set up to ensure that it is possible4700:02:47,111 --> 00:02:49,248to understand the mechanisms for success4800:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,023or the reasons for failure.4900:02:51,211 --> 00:02:54,998And phase three then outlines testing the strategy and  inherent in this phase is the clear establishment5000:02:58,737 --> 00:03:02,050of expected outcomes of the implementation strategy5100:03:02,245 --> 00:03:06,007to ensure that the framework is set for monitoring and evaluation5200:03:06,197 --> 00:03:08,960of the success of the strategy.5300:03:09,267 --> 00:03:12,742Another important take home message of module one5400:03:12,924 --> 00:03:16,499is an understanding of where implementation research5500:03:16,691 --> 00:03:19,691fits in with related approaches such as5600:03:19,591 --> 00:03:22,554intervention research, operational research5700:03:22,747 --> 00:03:24,572and health systems research.5800:03:24,759 --> 00:03:30,734Intervention research establishes the efficacy of the intervention,5900:03:30,937 --> 00:03:34,899that is, for instance, does mass administration6000:03:35,075 --> 00:03:40,113of ivermectin break the cycle of transmission of onchocerciasis6100:03:43,444 --> 00:03:45,232 or does home management of malaria reduce deaths in infants?6200:03:45,424 --> 00:03:48,762These tell us what would probably work6300:03:48,947 --> 00:03:51,947but now how to make it work.6400:03:52,205 --> 00:03:57,180Implementation research tells us how we can make that intervention work6500:03:57,362 --> 00:04:00,549within the community or within the population.6600:04:00,898 --> 00:04:04,161Part of making it work may therefore involve6700:04:04,357 --> 00:04:06,895an element of health systems research6800:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,180which explores the factors that affect the performance6900:04:10,392 --> 00:04:11,955of a health system.7000:04:12,147 --> 00:04:15,147An implementation research could also incorporate7100:04:15,944 --> 00:04:18,169aspects of operational research7200:04:18,371 --> 00:04:21,159which addresses operational challenges7300:04:21,345 --> 00:04:23,508within health systems.7400:04:23,692 --> 00:04:26,692And ultimately, effectiveness research7500:04:26,877 --> 00:04:31,302is how we assess the performance of our implementation strategies7600:04:31,486 --> 00:04:33,561in real life situations.7700:04:33,735 --> 00:04:38,347The clear message of Module One is that implementation research7800:04:38,532 --> 00:04:41,532has to take into account the complexities of working7900:04:42,626 --> 00:04:47,239in real life contexts away from the imposition of artificial8000:04:47,432 --> 00:04:51,357or controlled conditions, that are necessarily imposed8100:04:51,556 --> 00:04:55,118by an intervention research framework.8200:04:55,562 --> 00:04:59,362Module Two on settings and context8300:04:59,536 --> 00:05:03,386was presented by Professor Uche Amazigo8400:05:03,595 --> 00:05:05,607and Professor Bill Brieger.8500:05:05,804 --> 00:05:08,592Uche and Bill begin to highlight just how complex the real life environment is8600:05:12,998 --> 00:05:17,148requiring an understanding of how to work within8700:05:17,365 --> 00:05:21,778economic and political context, with an often large range8800:05:21,977 --> 00:05:24,977of actors at multiple levels.8900:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,672It also requires working with a broad range of processes,9000:05:29,857 --> 00:05:32,857systems and regulatory environments.9100:05:33,044 --> 00:05:36,044And finally, having to work with individuals9200:05:36,752 --> 00:05:42,327who are constrained by knowledge, culture, belief systems9300:05:42,526 --> 00:05:44,963problems of access, and so on,9400:05:45,150 --> 00:05:49,738all of which need to be understood to understand the context in which9500:05:49,923 --> 00:05:52,623implementation is supposed to occur.9600:05:52,820 --> 00:05:56,007They took us through the various research processes9700:05:56,203 --> 00:05:59,691that will help to unpack this complexity starting9800:05:59,876 --> 00:06:01,626with a needs assessment9900:06:01,801 --> 00:06:05,414to help identify the issues from the communityâ€™s perspective10000:06:05,590 --> 00:06:07,815and from the implementer's perspective.10100:06:07,994 --> 00:06:10,694They highlighted various primary and secondary10200:06:10,894 --> 00:06:12,144sources of data10300:06:12,325 --> 00:06:15,325and the importance of framing the research question10400:06:15,532 --> 00:06:19,007to ensure that you collect the right sorts of data.10500:06:19,292 --> 00:06:24,092An important point they raise is the need for longer term planning10600:06:24,310 --> 00:06:28,810to ensure that their understanding of context remains dynamic10700:06:28,997 --> 00:06:31,997and provides the right sort of data to enable you to assess your10800:06:33,424 --> 00:06:35,061implementation strategy10900:06:35,245 --> 00:06:38,407not just for the short term effectiveness but also11000:06:38,605 --> 00:06:42,442with the potential to follow through to ensure sustainability and where appropriate, to monitor the elemiination of the disease.11100:06:47,305 --> 00:06:51,868The next module was Module Three, which was on the design11200:06:52,116 --> 00:06:54,179of implementation strategies.11300:06:54,366 --> 00:06:59,541Professor Maria Rosario Martins, Doctor Neil Alexander and Doctor Jorge Arroz11400:07:04,124 --> 00:07:07,124took you through Module 3 on the design of implementation strategies11500:07:07,255 --> 00:07:09,743and the research approaches required11600:07:09,937 --> 00:07:14,787to ensure robust evidence to justify your implementation approach.11700:07:15,220 --> 00:07:18,695They stressed the importance of using a combination11800:07:18,898 --> 00:07:22,061of relevant theories, empirical evidence on11900:07:22,268 --> 00:07:26,743what works and, of course, a healthy dose of pragmatism12000:07:26,945 --> 00:07:30,570based on your available resources, the environment in which12100:07:30,755 --> 00:07:32,855you have to work and the communities12200:07:33,033 --> 00:07:35,608with whom you will need to engage.12300:07:36,003 --> 00:07:39,003They provide examples of specific strategies12400:07:39,186 --> 00:07:41,249that are needed, for instance12500:07:41,443 --> 00:07:43,806for different levels of actors who are part12600:07:44,004 --> 00:07:46,354of the implementation process.12700:07:47,139 --> 00:07:50,139An important lesson here is that it becomes evident very quickly12800:07:52,241 --> 00:07:56,066that implementation research involves multiple strategies12900:07:56,258 --> 00:07:59,258each of which will need to have13000:07:58,449 --> 00:08:01,836well defined outcomes for evaluation.13100:08:02,616 --> 00:08:05,616It also becomes clear from Module Three13200:08:05,810 --> 00:08:09,947that the importance of the research question cannot be underestimated13300:08:10,153 --> 00:08:12,241in the design of your research.13400:08:12,509 --> 00:08:16,659In Module Four, Doctor Olakunle Alonge13500:08:16,847 --> 00:08:20,585and Doctor Vivian Go provide a detailed explanation of how to evaluate implementation research 13600:08:24,078 --> 00:08:30,403by clearly articulating appropriate implementation research outcomes.13700:08:30,621 --> 00:08:35,846They start by making an important distinction between efficacy13800:08:36,034 --> 00:08:40,584of an intervention and implementation effectiveness.13900:08:41,607 --> 00:08:47,969So, intervention efficacy is the effect of an intervention14000:08:48,180 --> 00:08:50,430under controlled settings.14100:08:50,664 --> 00:08:55,852Intervention effectiveness is the effect of an intervention14200:08:56,092 --> 00:08:58,392in a real world setting.14300:08:58,575 --> 00:09:03,325Implementation effectiveness is the effect of efforts14400:09:03,554 --> 00:09:08,379including strategies, to deliver an effective intervention14500:09:08,561 --> 00:09:11,561in new settings, other than where it was previously tested for effectiveness14600:09:15,423 --> 00:09:21,861and/or, within broader populations under real-world conditions.14700:09:22,350 --> 00:09:26,125Such efforts include getting the effective intervention14800:09:26,306 --> 00:09:29,969adopted, sustained, and scaled up.14900:09:30,189 --> 00:09:32,164I hope that was clear.15000:09:32,400 --> 00:09:36,775Specific outcomes may relate, for instance15100:09:36,972 --> 00:09:43,060to acceptability, sustainability, compliance, appropriateness,15200:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,145penetration, or coverage, and so on.15300:09:48,283 --> 00:09:53,471It is critical that these outcomes take account of the context15400:09:53,676 --> 00:09:57,388and this point then links us back to all the concepts15500:09:57,581 --> 00:10:01,069that have been addressed in Modules One through Four.15600:10:01,274 --> 00:10:04,874I will now hand you over to Doctor Paul Milligan15700:10:05,058 --> 00:10:08,221and Doctor  Corine Merle who coordinated15800:10:08,403 --> 00:10:12,028this fifth module and they bring it to life15900:10:12,209 --> 00:10:13,721by bringing together a range16000:10:13,890 --> 00:10:16,202of stakeholders and community members16100:10:16,394 --> 00:10:19,944who have applied all of these principles in practice.16200:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,159Of particular relevance are the discussions16300:10:23,353 --> 00:10:25,703about what is required in the scale-up16400:10:25,872 --> 00:10:29,472of your implementation research within your setting16500:10:29,673 --> 00:10:32,911or with broader application elsewhere.16600:10:33,262 --> 00:10:35,774Thank you for staying with us this far.16700:10:35,949 --> 00:10:38,749I sincerely hope it's been worth your while.16800:10:38,916 --> 00:10:42,103Sharing these resources and experiences with you16900:10:42,292 --> 00:10:45,292has been an absolute pleasure for all of us.17000:10:45,515 --> 00:10:48,515Thank you.
