000:00:05,427 --> 00:00:07,627Welcome to Module Five.100:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,535My name is Paul Milligan, I'm an epidemiologist.200:00:10,735 --> 00:00:13,735I'm based in London at the School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine,300:00:14,208 --> 00:00:17,658and it's my task to introduce to you the last section of this course400:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,853on implementation research.500:00:20,131 --> 00:00:21,881The title of this module is600:00:22,078 --> 00:00:24,828Implementation research in practice.700:00:25,028 --> 00:00:27,690We started with Pascale Allotey who summarized800:00:27,891 --> 00:00:32,041the key points from the previous modules you've been working through900:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,366and in the rest of this module we would like to look in more detail1000:00:36,599 --> 00:00:39,912at one intervention and we’re going to use this as an example1100:00:40,113 --> 00:00:43,063to illustrate how the different principles that you've heard about1200:00:43,209 --> 00:00:46,709in the previous modules are applied in practice.1300:00:47,064 --> 00:00:50,439And the example that we've chosen is Seasonal Malaria1400:00:50,636 --> 00:00:53,636Chemoprevention, or SMC.1500:00:53,845 --> 00:00:56,120This is a new approach to malaria control1600:00:56,301 --> 00:00:57,201and it's something1700:00:57,380 --> 00:00:59,818of an implementation research success story in that1800:01:00,020 --> 00:01:02,195countries have been quick to adopt this strategy1900:01:02,383 --> 00:01:05,683and deploy it at scale not long after it was recommended2000:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,875by the World Health Organization.2100:01:08,236 --> 00:01:12,586The implementation research on SMC was done in several countries.2200:01:12,758 --> 00:01:15,458In this chapter we're going to hear from investigators2300:01:15,647 --> 00:01:17,210in Senegal.2400:01:17,412 --> 00:01:20,299As you'll see, the research was a partnership between2500:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,587researchers and implementers and policy makers2600:01:23,794 --> 00:01:25,969and they worked together from the outset.2700:01:26,178 --> 00:01:29,628You will see the different study designs that they used,2800:01:29,829 --> 00:01:31,779what the important outcomes were,2900:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,148and the methods that were used to measure them.3000:01:34,413 --> 00:01:37,988And then in chapter three we will look at how this intervention3100:01:38,193 --> 00:01:40,030is eventually adopted and implemented3200:01:40,230 --> 00:01:43,230and some of the implementation research issues that arose3300:01:42,666 --> 00:01:42,782during scaling up.3400:01:44,698 --> 00:01:48,651We will start with an introduction from Peter Olumese from3500:01:48,779 --> 00:01:51,329the Global Malaria Program at WHO3600:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,525who is going to set the scene and then we'll see a video3700:01:54,726 --> 00:01:57,439that was produced for the National Malaria Control Programme3800:01:57,615 --> 00:02:01,652in Senegal to explain about Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention.3900:02:04,961 --> 00:02:07,536For WHO as one of the key things that we do,4000:02:08,120 --> 00:02:11,470it's making policies and helping countries to implement policies4100:02:11,657 --> 00:02:14,657on strategies, it's essential in 4200:02:15,649 --> 00:02:17,161making a policy decision.4300:02:17,336 --> 00:02:22,874We look at the efficacy and the safety of the intervention4400:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,083but at the same time also the implementability4500:02:26,341 --> 00:02:29,529of the intervention, how easy is it to implement4600:02:29,734 --> 00:02:32,734on a wide scale, because for most malaria interventions,4700:02:32,939 --> 00:02:35,276the issue is coverage.4800:02:35,643 --> 00:02:37,418The way that you are you able to implement,4900:02:37,613 --> 00:02:40,213the way that you are able to reach the audience that requires it,5000:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,712the more you get out of the intervention.5100:02:42,893 --> 00:02:46,031So how easy is it to implement becomes very important.5200:02:46,231 --> 00:02:50,341Is it acceptable, is it doable at low levels of the communities5300:02:50,434 --> 00:02:51,684where you want this delivered?5400:02:51,864 --> 00:02:53,632Is it affordable?5500:02:53,735 --> 00:02:56,097So cost effectiveness becomes very important,5600:02:56,308 --> 00:02:58,446and also how does this add on5700:02:58,642 --> 00:03:00,142to the interventions already on ground?5800:03:00,332 --> 00:03:03,157You don't want to bring in a new intervention that5900:03:03,367 --> 00:03:05,842sort of weakens interventions already on ground.6000:03:06,026 --> 00:03:09,401And for all of this to happen you need a lot of6100:03:09,597 --> 00:03:13,434implementation research, a lot of real-life situation research6200:03:13,634 --> 00:03:15,165that gives you these answers.6300:03:15,478 --> 00:03:19,578And usually for most interventions in the past6400:03:19,779 --> 00:03:22,704we tended to do this in series.6500:03:22,937 --> 00:03:25,712First of all, you prove that the intervention works6600:03:25,932 --> 00:03:28,932by the researchers and then the next question is 6700:03:29,109 --> 00:03:30,422“can we implement this?”6800:03:30,606 --> 00:03:33,106and that takes an additional two-three years6900:03:33,296 --> 00:03:35,683trying to answer “can we implement this?”.7000:03:35,897 --> 00:03:40,222So we have learnt from experience that it's best to do these7100:03:40,430 --> 00:03:42,218as it were, in parallel.7200:03:42,426 --> 00:03:46,226Once you ensure that this intervention would have7300:03:47,489 --> 00:03:51,789some reasonable effect, then you also begin to say7400:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,294“how do we implement this?”7500:03:53,483 --> 00:03:58,958And so it's very crucial early on at the design7600:03:59,146 --> 00:04:01,321and to have both the researchers,7700:04:01,517 --> 00:04:04,492the implementers, and the policy makers7800:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,177all sit together and contribute7900:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,360to the development of the strategy and the product.8000:04:11,588 --> 00:04:17,601Of course, at the very early stage you have more input from the science,8100:04:17,803 --> 00:04:20,928the researchers, and as you move towards8200:04:21,107 --> 00:04:24,732the strategy being fully adopted and implementation,8300:04:24,947 --> 00:04:29,259more of the implementers and the policy makers.8400:04:29,452 --> 00:04:32,852But having all of them work together from the very beginning8500:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,666makes a great deal of impact.8600:04:35,856 --> 00:04:39,868And this was the example of the seasonal malaria chemoprevention:8700:04:40,082 --> 00:04:43,245we had the researchers, the policy makers8800:04:43,422 --> 00:04:47,197and the implementers work together from the very beginning8900:04:47,401 --> 00:04:53,351and we can say that on record it's one of those strategies where9000:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,543we have moved very quickly from9100:04:56,743 --> 00:04:59,342making a policy recommendation9200:04:59,559 --> 00:05:02,547to country adoption and rapid scale-up9300:05:02,740 --> 00:05:05,840because most of the questions were answered during9400:05:06,047 --> 00:05:08,134the development process of this strategy.9500:05:08,366 --> 00:05:11,067Malaria is still a major public health issue9600:05:11,404 --> 00:05:14,265causing over 655 000 deaths in the world.9700:05:14,465 --> 00:05:17,46591% of deaths caused by malaria9800:05:17,665 --> 00:05:19,379occur in Sub-Saharan Africa9900:05:19,615 --> 00:05:22,615where children under 5 represent over 86% of cases.10000:05:23,441 --> 00:05:25,456That's how Senegal,10100:05:25,736 --> 00:05:27,413following the WHO recommendations10200:05:27,686 --> 00:05:29,769is implementing a new intervention plan10300:05:29,941 --> 00:05:31,058against this disease.10400:05:31,182 --> 00:05:33,761Seasonal malaria chemoprevention10500:05:33,916 --> 00:05:34,775or SMC10600:05:34,893 --> 00:05:36,607for children from 3 months to 10 years old10700:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,544in strongly endemic regions10800:05:38,734 --> 00:05:39,526during the winter peeriod.10900:05:39,894 --> 00:05:42,130The strategy used for SMC11000:05:42,471 --> 00:05:45,471is mostly based on the participation of volunteers11100:05:46,126 --> 00:05:47,685or community health agents11200:05:47,910 --> 00:05:48,845living in the village.11300:05:49,153 --> 00:05:50,875Senegal and its partners11400:05:51,134 --> 00:05:53,563have put emphasis on the training of these agents11500:05:53,844 --> 00:05:56,844to ensure their mastering of the tools developed at a central level.11600:05:57,162 --> 00:06:00,162Once trained, and following a door to door strategy11700:06:01,072 --> 00:06:03,681these agents go around the village11800:06:03,983 --> 00:06:06,614and administrate to children from 3 to 120 months old11900:06:07,117 --> 00:06:09,743a combination of SP and amodiaquine12000:06:10,006 --> 00:06:10,870for 3 to 4 months12100:06:11,117 --> 00:06:12,115in some regions12200:06:12,322 --> 00:06:13,281during the winter period.12300:06:13,642 --> 00:06:16,046If I've accepted to work for my community12400:06:16,386 --> 00:06:19,386it's for me before it's for others.12500:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,946We know the drug works.12600:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,319We, community agents, maintain our commitment12700:06:26,617 --> 00:06:29,617because this campaign is useful to children.12800:06:30,128 --> 00:06:32,839Where there is value for the population12900:06:33,077 --> 00:06:36,177agents have to commit to it.13000:06:36,377 --> 00:06:39,053In addition, we insist very heavily13100:06:39,253 --> 00:06:41,117for heads of the family, mothers, to respect the dosage,13200:06:41,309 --> 00:06:44,309and that children always sleep13300:06:44,509 --> 00:06:47,121under a treated mosquito net, even if the child has received13400:06:47,321 --> 00:06:48,942drugs during the campaign.13500:06:49,102 --> 00:06:50,377I am pleased with this campaign13600:06:50,502 --> 00:06:52,597that protects my children from malaria.13700:06:52,936 --> 00:06:55,936These agents are supervised by community leaders13800:06:56,312 --> 00:06:57,993and by the central level.13900:06:58,838 --> 00:07:01,501SMC gives a very high degree of protection14000:07:01,722 --> 00:07:05,197but as we saw in that video from Senegal14100:07:05,396 --> 00:07:08,608implementing on a large scale presents some challenges.14200:07:08,841 --> 00:07:10,979The drugs protect for only about four weeks14300:07:11,179 --> 00:07:13,815and so the treatment has to be repeated each month14400:07:14,015 --> 00:07:17,913and this strict timing is necessary in order to maintain protection14500:07:18,113 --> 00:07:19,912throughout the high risk period.14600:07:20,358 --> 00:07:22,797And giving drugs has to be done carefully,14700:07:23,051 --> 00:07:26,776there's a nine step process that the health workers have to follow.14800:07:26,979 --> 00:07:28,779They need to check if the child is unwell14900:07:28,970 --> 00:07:30,832because those children may not have malaria15000:07:31,022 --> 00:07:33,160so they need to go and be tested; they need to check15100:07:33,352 --> 00:07:34,690that the child doesn't have allergies15200:07:34,880 --> 00:07:36,492to the drugs that are being used15300:07:36,695 --> 00:07:39,170and they need to check that the right dose is being given15400:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,091for the child's age and so on.15500:07:42,049 --> 00:07:45,627As Peter Olumese explained at the start of this chapter,15600:07:45,913 --> 00:07:48,825implementation needs to be as simple as possible15700:07:49,006 --> 00:07:50,706so that it can be delivered effectively15800:07:50,910 --> 00:07:53,048at full scale and reach all the population15900:07:53,236 --> 00:07:56,561not just those with easier access to health care.16000:07:56,760 --> 00:07:58,739And if it's going to be sustained16100:07:58,899 --> 00:08:01,762it needs to fit into the existing activities with health staff16200:08:01,959 --> 00:08:04,296without overloading the system.16300:08:04,496 --> 00:08:08,188By about 2006, clinical trials had shown that this approach16400:08:08,402 --> 00:08:12,402of giving anti-malaria treatment every month could give16500:08:12,591 --> 00:08:14,841a very high degree of protection from malaria16600:08:15,021 --> 00:08:17,984and projects were organized16700:08:18,219 --> 00:08:21,007in a number of different countries to find out how this intervention16800:08:21,197 --> 00:08:23,135could be delivered in practice.16900:08:23,313 --> 00:08:28,663In Senegal, the researchers arranged a series of consultations17000:08:28,858 --> 00:08:31,858with senior managers in the Ministry of Health17100:08:32,175 --> 00:08:33,800and then with district medical officers17200:08:33,982 --> 00:08:37,295and with health post nurses and community health workers17300:08:37,481 --> 00:08:40,844to develop the implementation approach that would be used.17400:08:41,358 --> 00:08:44,983Then they did a pilot study of this approach17500:08:45,161 --> 00:08:47,824and then this was followed by a larger scale study17600:08:48,020 --> 00:08:51,020of the feasibility and the effectiveness.17700:08:49,876 --> 00:08:50,876So we will hear from17800:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,264the investigators who were involved in this:17900:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,790Doctor Yankhogba Dial and his team18000:08:55,990 --> 00:08:58,215will explain about the pilot study18100:08:58,416 --> 00:09:00,866and then El Hadj Ba from the research team18200:09:01,053 --> 00:09:04,341will explain how the larger scale study was organized.18300:09:04,639 --> 00:09:05,113Often18400:09:05,313 --> 00:09:07,522a lot of children would die18500:09:07,752 --> 00:09:09,415from malaria in this zone, and18600:09:09,615 --> 00:09:11,243there was a problem18700:09:11,456 --> 00:09:14,431and nothing specific was really done18800:09:14,785 --> 00:09:17,113other than routine interventions.18900:09:18,412 --> 00:09:20,262The parasitology lab19000:09:20,611 --> 00:09:22,723of Professor Oumar Gaye contacted us19100:09:22,922 --> 00:09:28,717to implement SMC for children.19200:09:28,994 --> 00:09:30,651We knew it was effective19300:09:31,079 --> 00:09:34,900but not how to implement it in a whole district19400:09:35,112 --> 00:09:36,992because it hadn't ever been done in a district.19500:09:37,304 --> 00:09:40,961And we thought it wasn't a project to discuss just amongst ourselves,19600:09:41,161 --> 00:09:43,289it had to be opened up to all stakeholders.19700:09:55,217 --> 00:09:57,197So discussions took place19800:09:57,534 --> 00:10:00,871to see if we should19900:10:01,271 --> 00:10:04,626give the products to the mothers20000:10:04,984 --> 00:10:09,096who would administrate them to children in public20100:10:09,813 --> 00:10:12,145or ... what should we do ?20200:10:13,344 --> 00:10:15,301So finally, multi-purpose teams20300:10:15,501 --> 00:10:17,217after discussion, proposed20400:10:17,628 --> 00:10:18,877to go from door to door.20500:10:19,164 --> 00:10:22,851Three strategies were suggested20600:10:23,193 --> 00:10:28,755but we decided to go with the door to door strategy20700:10:29,772 --> 00:10:35,834because we thought that strategy would be most effective20800:10:36,103 --> 00:10:39,028regarding different community experiences20900:10:39,228 --> 00:10:42,895that had taken place in the district.21000:10:46,184 --> 00:10:47,090To do that21100:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,616we adopted three main strategies21200:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,613which were: to insist on21300:10:52,813 --> 00:10:55,237awareness before administration21400:10:55,437 --> 00:11:00,059because mothers were to administrate both doses21500:11:00,233 --> 00:11:02,131so we had to explain this to them21600:11:02,331 --> 00:11:05,505so they could give them right.21700:11:05,705 --> 00:11:08,244Then, there were side effects.21800:11:08,444 --> 00:11:10,252Especially with amodiaquine.21900:11:10,452 --> 00:11:12,860Some babies were throwing up22000:11:13,060 --> 00:11:15,119and some mothers got worried.22100:11:15,319 --> 00:11:16,828But to reassure them22200:11:17,028 --> 00:11:22,350we told them when children present with symptoms or complications22300:11:22,681 --> 00:11:23,989they have to present the children to the health services to be managed efficiently.22400:11:24,189 --> 00:11:26,634(INAUDIBLE) effective.22500:11:28,717 --> 00:11:30,288It was a test phase22600:11:30,488 --> 00:11:31,440so we had to chose22700:11:31,640 --> 00:11:34,979between the different district posts.22800:11:35,179 --> 00:11:37,089The choice was made first of all in relation to 22900:11:37,251 --> 00:11:40,021the community network:23000:11:40,221 --> 00:11:42,495the chosen post needed a very dense network.23100:11:42,695 --> 00:11:44,410Accessibility:23200:11:44,610 --> 00:11:47,502to allow supervision23300:11:47,702 --> 00:11:50,616and quick intervention in case23400:11:50,816 --> 00:11:53,594there were any side effects.23500:11:55,778 --> 00:11:57,357After these meetings23600:11:57,557 --> 00:11:59,864we decided to23700:12:00,064 --> 00:12:03,163to start the project in the Tivouaoune district23800:12:03,363 --> 00:12:06,320and there was a very important step23900:12:06,520 --> 00:12:10,004that contributed to its success.24000:12:10,204 --> 00:12:12,855It was the awareness raising24100:12:13,055 --> 00:12:18,707and the information campaign in the communities.24200:12:18,907 --> 00:12:23,147At the beginning we prepared an advocacy speech24300:12:23,347 --> 00:12:26,404for the community leaders.24400:12:26,604 --> 00:12:31,583We raised awareness with the heads of the villages,24500:12:31,783 --> 00:12:33,259the imams,24600:12:36,109 --> 00:12:39,546all the leaders in the community.24700:12:42,377 --> 00:12:43,705Everyone was in agreement on the effectiveness of the project,24800:12:43,866 --> 00:12:44,85724900:12:45,019 --> 00:12:46,360before the implementation25000:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,033but not on the feasibility of the implementation in the district.25100:12:49,233 --> 00:12:52,016So a team of the symposium25200:12:52,216 --> 00:12:54,644came to see, at the same time,25300:12:54,844 --> 00:12:57,159the acceptation of the intervention:25400:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,311are the populations accepting, or not ?25500:13:00,511 --> 00:13:03,109And there was even a study of the cost:25600:13:03,309 --> 00:13:04,736every time we spent money25700:13:04,936 --> 00:13:06,767we put it down25800:13:06,967 --> 00:13:09,652and it was used to figure out25900:13:09,852 --> 00:13:14,408how much it would cost to take care of this intervention.26000:13:16,913 --> 00:13:19,522We showed the results to prove26100:13:19,722 --> 00:13:23,086that we could implement this strategy in a district.26200:13:23,286 --> 00:13:25,553But we were also satisfied to see26300:13:25,753 --> 00:13:28,300that this intervention was then capitalised on and introduced26400:13:31,421 --> 00:13:32,709not only in other regions of Senegal, but also 26500:13:35,870 --> 00:13:36,888in other countries.26600:13:37,088 --> 00:13:39,538And that was a capital result, I think.26700:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,735As you've heard in Module Three, which was concerned with26800:13:42,924 --> 00:13:45,887the development of new implementation strategies26900:13:46,099 --> 00:13:49,686it's very important that these are developed in consultation with27000:13:49,873 --> 00:13:52,936implementers, policy makers, and with the community.27100:13:53,168 --> 00:13:56,168And we saw a good example of this from the team in Senegal.27200:13:56,422 --> 00:14:00,322A number of options for delivery of SMC were considered27300:14:00,516 --> 00:14:01,678including, delivery at fixed27400:14:01,865 --> 00:14:04,390distribution centers and door to door.27500:14:04,634 --> 00:14:07,759We heard that the group preferred the door to door approach  because27600:14:07,971 --> 00:14:10,796they had positive experience with this method:27700:14:10,969 --> 00:14:12,981they felt people wouldn't come a distribution point,27800:14:13,153 --> 00:14:15,028it was necessary to go door to door27900:14:15,228 --> 00:14:18,228to ensure good uptake. And door to door health workers28000:14:18,544 --> 00:14:21,256have the time to explain the intervention to families28100:14:21,451 --> 00:14:23,550and this was felt to be important.28200:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,190Based on feedback from care givers, they also preferred this approach.28300:14:28,572 --> 00:14:30,735This was only a small scale study28400:14:30,926 --> 00:14:33,126but it was clear that the intervention was popular28500:14:33,332 --> 00:14:36,332with communities, it could be delivered by lay health workers,28600:14:36,530 --> 00:14:39,718the costs were in line with other interventions against malaria28700:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,458but there was still a question of whether the intervention28800:14:42,625 --> 00:14:44,525could be delivered on a large scale28900:14:44,704 --> 00:14:47,379and so it was necessary to plan a larger study29000:14:47,558 --> 00:14:50,983to demonstrate feasibility and effectiveness.29100:14:51,497 --> 00:14:54,147The intervention was introduced in three districts29200:14:54,335 --> 00:14:55,747over three years.29300:14:55,924 --> 00:14:59,337It had to be done gradually as this was a completely new approach29400:14:59,743 --> 00:15:01,868but during this time, the researchers were able29500:15:02,058 --> 00:15:05,495to hand over the responsibility for coordinating the implementation29600:15:05,676 --> 00:15:07,476entirely to the district health team29700:15:07,659 --> 00:15:10,047so that in the last year of the study the assessment29800:15:10,231 --> 00:15:13,231really reflected the real life situation.29900:15:13,431 --> 00:15:16,431El Hadj Ba  from the IRD in Dakar was one of the investigators30000:15:16,833 --> 00:15:20,683and he will explain now more about this larger scale study.30100:15:20,883 --> 00:15:23,348Tivaouane served as a pilot,30200:15:23,548 --> 00:15:25,835as a pilot for our study.30300:15:26,035 --> 00:15:32,689We did it on a larger scale to prove it's feasible in different contexts.30400:15:32,889 --> 00:15:37,304We did it in a semi-urban zone and a typically rural zone.30500:15:37,504 --> 00:15:41,071And also in contexts where there were differences between zones in terms of the contexts of prevailing morbidity30600:15:41,271 --> 00:15:43,999or of sociological and societal questions30700:15:44,199 --> 00:15:45,900.30800:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,968So that helped us understand30900:15:48,168 --> 00:15:49,551from a logistics point of view31000:15:49,751 --> 00:15:53,131how mobilize these logistics in 3 sanitary districts31100:15:53,331 --> 00:15:57,102to implement SMC in different contexts31200:15:57,302 --> 00:15:59,666regarding geographical and physical accessibility.31300:15:59,866 --> 00:16:04,125It gave us answers to some of our questions31400:16:04,325 --> 00:16:05,890regarding the implementation of IPT.31500:16:07,982 --> 00:16:10,704It was to test the feasibility,31600:16:10,954 --> 00:16:12,184the acceptation31700:16:12,397 --> 00:16:14,623and also the safety,31800:16:14,939 --> 00:16:17,715and also the impact of IPT31900:16:17,915 --> 00:16:19,313when it's done on a large scale32000:16:19,513 --> 00:16:22,115with a minimum of supervision by the health system.32100:16:22,315 --> 00:16:24,752We had to do an evaluation after the implementation32200:16:24,952 --> 00:16:27,497which allowed us to know the coverage and32300:16:27,697 --> 00:16:31,556the acceptation was measured through interviews32400:16:31,756 --> 00:16:33,598with socio-anthropologists.32500:16:33,798 --> 00:16:36,610We have coverage studies with the registries32600:16:36,810 --> 00:16:39,381because we had a demographic surveillance system,32700:16:39,581 --> 00:16:43,046which allowed to identify the individual, his age,32800:16:43,246 --> 00:16:46,601and on the registry we even noted the dose to be given,32900:16:46,984 --> 00:16:48,826and it allowed us to know33000:16:49,026 --> 00:16:50,388who received it,33100:16:50,588 --> 00:16:51,747who didn't,33200:16:51,891 --> 00:16:54,236why he didn't received, absences, refusals,33300:16:54,436 --> 00:16:56,215and the throwing up.33400:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,956All of this was noted33500:16:58,156 --> 00:17:00,075and it allowed us to do a precise evaluation33600:17:00,275 --> 00:17:03,000of the acceptability33700:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,763and of the refusals,33800:17:04,964 --> 00:17:06,934and of the losses of drugs33900:17:07,134 --> 00:17:10,635with tools used from Tivaouane34000:17:10,835 --> 00:17:12,069and adapted to the context34100:17:12,270 --> 00:17:14,811to allow us to follow the implementation,34200:17:15,012 --> 00:17:17,386to evaluate the loss of drugs.34300:17:17,586 --> 00:17:19,252The cost was evaluated34400:17:19,452 --> 00:17:23,888with questionnaires specifically for district doctors34500:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,800and others specifically for investigators34600:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,593to try to trace their daily activity,34700:17:28,793 --> 00:17:31,649all that they had to spend during the intervention34800:17:31,849 --> 00:17:35,173to procure from health structures,34900:17:35,373 --> 00:17:36,789all this was collected.35000:17:36,989 --> 00:17:40,516Costs linked to the supervision, costs linked to buying drugs,35100:17:40,716 --> 00:17:43,765costs linked to paying the agents35200:17:43,965 --> 00:17:47,266and the other costs were all tallied35300:17:47,466 --> 00:17:50,368and it allowed us to find that the SMC35400:17:50,568 --> 00:17:54,052for one child protected cost about $1.50.35500:17:54,252 --> 00:17:57,986I think all of this contributes to the SMC being recommended35600:17:58,186 --> 00:18:00,112by the WHO,35700:18:00,312 --> 00:18:02,358and that was presented at the WHO.35800:18:04,275 --> 00:18:07,000We used the stepped wedge design because35900:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,314since we had already proven that IPT was effective36000:18:10,514 --> 00:18:13,681it was not ethical to  have36100:18:13,881 --> 00:18:15,374a control arm  and  an intervention arm .36200:18:15,574 --> 00:18:17,019That was the first thing.36300:18:17,219 --> 00:18:19,199And also, malaria changes each year.36400:18:19,399 --> 00:18:21,359So if you conduct a control,36500:18:21,559 --> 00:18:24,382maybe the next year the zone36600:18:24,582 --> 00:18:28,807can have a superior incidence36700:18:29,059 --> 00:18:31,836comparedto the control period.36800:18:32,036 --> 00:18:32,819So that's a problem.36900:18:33,019 --> 00:18:35,365And the other benefit is that37000:18:35,497 --> 00:18:39,472in a zone where there was no intervention,37100:18:39,672 --> 00:18:41,340that zone can serve as a control37200:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,839for the first zone when it receives the IPT.37300:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,950So we can compare between zones37400:18:47,150 --> 00:18:49,571and inside the zone, before and after.37500:18:49,771 --> 00:18:51,910And that, only the stepped wedge design  system allows it.37600:18:52,479 --> 00:18:56,429We heard  from El Hadj Ba how the intervention was assessed37700:18:56,614 --> 00:19:00,714in a range of different settings, and if you recall from Module Two,37800:19:00,917 --> 00:19:03,454one of the key messages there was the importance37900:19:03,646 --> 00:19:06,258of considering the different situations where an intervention38000:19:06,451 --> 00:19:07,364may be used.38100:19:07,546 --> 00:19:11,696El Hadj explained the study included urban and rural populations,38200:19:11,886 --> 00:19:14,686it included health facilities with different levels of capacity38300:19:14,874 --> 00:19:16,699to coordinate the implementation.38400:19:16,886 --> 00:19:19,774And this was important so that we could find out if the strategy38500:19:19,968 --> 00:19:23,468could be effectively delivered in a wide range of settings,38600:19:23,695 --> 00:19:25,220if the approach needed to be adapted38700:19:25,415 --> 00:19:27,115what the local challenges may have been38800:19:27,316 --> 00:19:31,166and how the cost of implementation varied from one place to another.38900:19:31,627 --> 00:19:35,102It may be useful to say at this point a bit more about the outcomes39000:19:35,302 --> 00:19:38,302of implementation research and how they're measured.39100:19:38,994 --> 00:19:41,681As you remember from this slide39200:19:41,889 --> 00:19:43,676that we saw in Module Four39300:19:43,854 --> 00:19:46,491there’s a range of different outcomes that are specific to39400:19:46,667 --> 00:19:48,904implementation research.39500:19:49,113 --> 00:19:51,563Many of these were measured in the studies in Senegal,39600:19:51,745 --> 00:19:55,595both in the pilot study and then in the wide arrange of settings39700:19:55,797 --> 00:19:57,322in the larger scale study.39800:19:57,523 --> 00:20:01,048Various different methods used to measure these outcomes39900:20:01,238 --> 00:20:04,563and you've seen some examples in the studies that we've looked at.40000:20:04,763 --> 00:20:09,205Direct observation was used to record the interactions between40100:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,298health workers and caregivers.40200:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,888This is important to understand what health workers actually do:40300:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,467are they applying the guidelines as intended,40400:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,667have they adapted the approaches and if so, how?40500:20:20,867 --> 00:20:23,729Fidelity was one of the outcomes mentioned in Module 4.40600:20:23,954 --> 00:20:26,954Is the intervention being administered as intended?40700:20:27,221 --> 00:20:30,346Check lists can be used to record key aspects,40800:20:31,326 --> 00:20:33,776a time taken for activities can be recorded40900:20:33,976 --> 00:20:36,989and responses of patients and families can be noted.41000:20:37,540 --> 00:20:41,053In-depth interviews with caregivers, with health workers,41100:20:41,261 --> 00:20:44,198with policy makers as well, are another important tool,41200:20:44,420 --> 00:20:47,420useful for understanding perceptions and attitudes41300:20:46,789 --> 00:20:48,989in practice in relation to the intervention.41400:20:49,166 --> 00:20:53,128An interview guide is prepared to ensure key points are covered,41500:20:53,345 --> 00:20:57,170the interviews are recorded, then the recording is transcribed41600:20:57,364 --> 00:20:59,852wordforword, translated if necessary41700:21:00,052 --> 00:21:01,687and analyzed.41800:21:01,877 --> 00:21:04,127Focus group discussions with selected groups,41900:21:04,301 --> 00:21:06,452groups of health workers, or groups of caregivers42000:21:06,934 --> 00:21:09,959are also used to find out about the group’s opinions and attitudes42100:21:10,175 --> 00:21:11,613in relation to health issues.42200:21:11,813 --> 00:21:13,128These can be very useful42300:21:13,345 --> 00:21:16,345but they need to be run by a skilled facilitator.42400:21:17,137 --> 00:21:19,537Then we have quantitative surveys.42500:21:19,731 --> 00:21:23,294Probability sampling techniques are used to select a representative sample42600:21:23,474 --> 00:21:26,836of the population, and the survey then measures the coverage42700:21:27,018 --> 00:21:28,518by checking record cards,42800:21:28,716 --> 00:21:31,366the caregiver is asked about adherence,42900:21:31,555 --> 00:21:35,343this is cross checked by looking at any leftover medication.43000:21:35,555 --> 00:21:38,430We may ask about household assets to estimate relative43100:21:38,620 --> 00:21:41,345wealth in order to be able to understand if the intervention43200:21:41,522 --> 00:21:44,522is reaching the poorer sections of the community.43300:21:45,008 --> 00:21:48,008It's important to assess the costs of delivering the intervention:43400:21:48,206 --> 00:21:51,206the various costs of providing the intervention in terms of43500:21:51,421 --> 00:21:55,621resources and staff time are itemized in order to estimate the cost43600:21:55,821 --> 00:21:58,821of delivery per child and to understand which aspects43700:21:59,345 --> 00:22:01,820contribute most to the overall cost.43800:22:02,046 --> 00:22:04,834And we may also include any time and cost incurred43900:22:05,025 --> 00:22:06,725by the household for their children44000:22:06,894 --> 00:22:09,894to be able to receive the intervention.44100:22:10,163 --> 00:22:13,101Lastly, safety monitoring.44200:22:13,281 --> 00:22:15,506This is done both by active44300:22:15,685 --> 00:22:18,147follow-up of the cohort of recipients of the intervention44400:22:18,333 --> 00:22:21,421as well as passively by reporting at health facilities44500:22:21,599 --> 00:22:24,599when there are patients with complaints of side-effects.44600:22:24,816 --> 00:22:28,066Safety wasn't listed as one of the outcomes in Module Four44700:22:28,254 --> 00:22:31,254but it is an important aspect to implementation research44800:22:31,429 --> 00:22:33,202in mass drug administration.44900:22:33,321 --> 00:22:35,996If relatively minor side-effects are common45000:22:36,188 --> 00:22:39,188this may make the intervention less acceptable.45100:22:39,448 --> 00:22:43,436If severe cases occur, these need to be responded to immediately,45200:22:43,642 --> 00:22:44,580the causes understood45300:22:44,752 --> 00:22:46,989and measures put in place to avoid them in future.45400:22:47,187 --> 00:22:49,812This may involve changes being made45500:22:50,003 --> 00:22:52,578in how the intervention is administered.45600:22:52,833 --> 00:22:54,608The researchers were a part of45700:22:54,805 --> 00:22:56,530an international group of those involved45800:22:56,721 --> 00:23:00,671in research on SMC and this group met with policy makers45900:23:00,877 --> 00:23:06,027at WHO to review the accumulating evidence and identify gaps,46000:23:06,217 --> 00:23:08,492and key points that emerged from that were46100:23:08,664 --> 00:23:11,964the need to ensure consistency with existing policies46200:23:12,139 --> 00:23:13,976on drug treatment for malaria.46300:23:14,174 --> 00:23:15,674Children who are unwell should46400:23:15,845 --> 00:23:17,757be tested as they may not have malaria46500:23:17,942 --> 00:23:22,405so the SMC program should screen and refer those children.46600:23:22,791 --> 00:23:25,703There was a need identified for more extensive data on46700:23:25,903 --> 00:23:29,465safety and on cost of delivery and so it was possible46800:23:29,656 --> 00:23:32,656to strengthen the research in those areas.46900:23:33,236 --> 00:23:35,699And it was important to define the geographical regions47000:23:35,884 --> 00:23:37,634where the intervention will be most useful47100:23:37,809 --> 00:23:40,184in order to know how many children could potentially benefit47200:23:40,381 --> 00:23:42,669from this intervention.47300:23:42,916 --> 00:23:47,229A new strategy will be introduced into an existing health system:47400:23:47,447 --> 00:23:50,647the new strategy needs to be integrated as far as possible47500:23:50,850 --> 00:23:53,837with other activities if it's going to be sustainable.47600:23:54,032 --> 00:23:57,007And specific studies may be useful to investigate if47700:23:57,208 --> 00:23:58,845particular strategies can be combined47800:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,039to make sure there's no negative impact.47900:24:02,185 --> 00:24:05,685Jean Louis DNiaye from the University Cheikh Anta Diop, Dakar48000:24:05,876 --> 00:24:09,201will give us an example now of this kind of study.48100:24:09,779 --> 00:24:11,801Seasonal malaria chemoprevention48200:24:12,001 --> 00:24:14,289was added to pre-existing strategies48300:24:14,489 --> 00:24:16,520especially in the South of Senegal48400:24:16,676 --> 00:24:19,789where home management also called "pecadom"48500:24:19,989 --> 00:24:20,998already existed.48600:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,158"Pecadom" is the strategy48700:24:23,451 --> 00:24:25,882and "Desdom" is the healthcare specialist.48800:24:26,082 --> 00:24:29,210He is a voluntary actor48900:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,171chosen by his community49000:24:31,371 --> 00:24:34,317to provide healthcare for his community.49100:24:34,517 --> 00:24:37,947So generally it's somebody we train49200:24:38,147 --> 00:24:38,836to treat malaria49300:24:39,036 --> 00:24:43,372and for some time they've also been trained to treat acute respiratory diseases49400:24:43,573 --> 00:24:44,333and diarrhea.49500:24:44,537 --> 00:24:47,622We really needed to set up a study49600:24:47,822 --> 00:24:49,854to see the feasibility of combining49700:24:50,054 --> 00:24:51,089both of these strategies.49800:24:51,289 --> 00:24:52,260To do this,49900:24:52,460 --> 00:24:55,259to check the feasibility of the combination of50000:24:55,459 --> 00:24:57,226"pecadom" and SMC50100:24:57,426 --> 00:25:03,356we chose a technique using randomised clinic trials in clusters,50200:25:03,556 --> 00:25:11,743choosing randomly 12 villages that implemented "pecadom" and SMC50300:25:12,189 --> 00:25:15,741and 12 villages where there was only "pecadom".50400:25:16,258 --> 00:25:17,967During the intervention phase50500:25:18,113 --> 00:25:21,026we showed the combination was largely feasible.50600:25:21,351 --> 00:25:22,300And [it had] an added value50700:25:22,500 --> 00:25:26,289because agents doing "pecadom" and SMC50800:25:26,489 --> 00:25:29,140had less work than the other agents.50900:25:29,340 --> 00:25:34,123By combining "pecadom" and SMC51000:25:34,323 --> 00:25:39,853we showed a protective efficacity of over 83%.51100:25:40,055 --> 00:25:45,541So there was 83% less malaria in the zone51200:25:45,741 --> 00:25:50,573with SMC and "pecadom" compared to "pecadom" only.51300:25:50,773 --> 00:25:54,791This showed the decrease in the work load51400:25:54,991 --> 00:25:57,145of the community health agents51500:25:57,345 --> 00:25:59,957in the SMC intervention.51600:26:02,544 --> 00:26:04,255This SMC added value51700:26:04,455 --> 00:26:07,481allowed us to use a screening programme51800:26:07,681 --> 00:26:08,892for this strategy51900:26:09,092 --> 00:26:13,687and the results allowed national programs 52000:26:13,887 --> 00:26:15,87352100:26:16,073 --> 00:26:18,623to combine this strategy with "pecadom" in zones where "pecadom" exists.52200:26:19,094 --> 00:26:21,882This was a good example of a relatively simple study52300:26:22,070 --> 00:26:24,208that answered an important practical question about52400:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,390implementation of the new strategy in a specific context.52500:26:27,872 --> 00:26:30,509Did you notice the study design that was used?52600:26:30,694 --> 00:26:32,744If you remember in Module Three52700:26:33,033 --> 00:26:36,019Neil Alexander spoke about the choice of study design.52800:26:36,631 --> 00:26:39,206We have now seen several different study designs52900:26:39,391 --> 00:26:43,091that have been used in the work in Senegal.53000:26:43,352 --> 00:26:46,589We've heard first from Doctor Dial and his team53100:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,480and they described an implementation research study53200:26:49,668 --> 00:26:52,668that involved piloting the intervention in a small area53300:26:52,893 --> 00:26:56,330without a control group and evaluating it using a mixture53400:26:56,516 --> 00:27:00,391of quantitative surveys and qualitative methods.53500:27:00,758 --> 00:27:04,383Then, El Hadj Ba described a large scale feasibility study.53600:27:04,620 --> 00:27:07,945This used a stepped wedge design.53700:27:08,354 --> 00:27:13,554And finally, Jean Louis described a cluster randomized trial.53800:27:13,848 --> 00:27:15,411The key message here is that53900:27:15,612 --> 00:27:18,599the study design depends on the question to be answered.54000:27:18,777 --> 00:27:21,777The study may be the large study, or a small study54100:27:21,947 --> 00:27:24,647depending on the objectives, but in all cases54200:27:24,841 --> 00:27:27,841care is needed in developing the design54300:27:28,073 --> 00:27:31,411and this needs to be done with a multi-disciplinary team.54400:27:32,727 --> 00:27:35,990Unlike more controlled intervention trials,54500:27:36,177 --> 00:27:39,077in implementation research we're concerned with how54600:27:39,282 --> 00:27:42,520the intervention fits in the broader health system54700:27:42,729 --> 00:27:45,704and this involves considering the various interactions54800:27:45,904 --> 00:27:47,199that could occur.54900:27:47,514 --> 00:27:49,589In the studies that we've seen,55000:27:49,789 --> 00:27:52,914a useful tool that was used in designing the studies55100:27:53,114 --> 00:27:56,554was a conceptual framework. And we're going to end this chapter55200:27:56,816 --> 00:28:00,391with an example of how these frameworks are developed.55300:28:01,477 --> 00:28:04,252When planning an implementation research project55400:28:04,454 --> 00:28:07,254it is useful to prepare a conceptual diagram.55500:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,018These diagrams were introduced in Module Four55600:28:10,233 --> 00:28:13,233and we'll look now at an example applied to SMC.55700:28:14,377 --> 00:28:17,202So we set up the intervention on the left55800:28:17,404 --> 00:28:20,404and its desired effect on the right,55900:28:20,606 --> 00:28:24,406and then we add the pathway of how the implementation works.56000:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,395So, for instance, here we have monthly administration of drugs56100:28:28,585 --> 00:28:31,235but children are first screened for illness56200:28:31,416 --> 00:28:34,416and those who are unwell are referred for diagnosis56300:28:34,660 --> 00:28:37,322and after they have been treated they may then get SMC,56400:28:37,528 --> 00:28:40,103so that needs to be added into the pathway.56500:28:40,381 --> 00:28:44,406And then the next step is to add the conditions for each step to work56600:28:44,612 --> 00:28:46,562as intended.56700:28:47,283 --> 00:28:50,620So there may be quite a number of these of different types.56800:28:50,820 --> 00:28:54,571Finally we mark which outcomes will be monitored.56900:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,559So some may need counter factual analysis, that is57000:28:57,756 --> 00:29:00,369comparison with a control group of some sort.57100:29:00,572 --> 00:29:04,347Many outcomes can be measured directly without a comparison group.57200:29:04,568 --> 00:29:06,618We can't monitor every aspect57300:29:06,826 --> 00:29:09,701and so some of these must remain as assumptions.57400:29:09,995 --> 00:29:13,370It's important to consider unintended consequences.57500:29:13,557 --> 00:29:16,069For example, we'd be concerned if families stopped using57600:29:16,263 --> 00:29:19,263other preventive measures, or delayed treatment seeking57700:29:19,463 --> 00:29:21,282as an indirect result of our intervention.57800:29:21,408 --> 00:29:24,158And we can see these in the diagram and we may want to57900:29:24,334 --> 00:29:26,659try to monitor those effects.58000:29:26,842 --> 00:29:29,279The more down-stream public health outcomes58100:29:29,473 --> 00:29:32,898are outside our focus on implementation research58200:29:33,092 --> 00:29:35,604but it may be possible to measure some of these outcomes58300:29:35,790 --> 00:29:38,165in an implementation research project58400:29:38,354 --> 00:29:41,304and if so, it is important to do so to add to the evidence supporting58500:29:41,504 --> 00:29:42,826the intervention.58600:29:43,043 --> 00:29:46,018Infectious diseases are complex systems:58700:29:46,201 --> 00:29:50,739the situation may change, there can be unexpected consequences.58800:29:50,843 --> 00:29:54,368How best to monitor these trends may itself need some research.58900:29:54,568 --> 00:29:56,924Monitoring guidelines will be needed59000:29:56,977 --> 00:29:58,890and we'll have to be prepared then to adapt59100:29:59,086 --> 00:30:03,673the intervention approach in response to changing situations.
