000:00:05,192 --> 00:00:08,367Welcome to chapter three and congratulations100:00:08,574 --> 00:00:11,574on reaching this final chapter of the MOOC.200:00:11,984 --> 00:00:14,384The objective of implementation research300:00:14,584 --> 00:00:17,756is to get good interventions into widespread effective use400:00:18,047 --> 00:00:20,360and so it's appropriate that this final chapter500:00:20,676 --> 00:00:22,538is about scaling up.600:00:22,728 --> 00:00:23,953The previous chapter was700:00:24,133 --> 00:00:26,758about applying the methods of implementation research800:00:26,937 --> 00:00:30,812in practice and our theme was “Beginning with the end in mind”.900:00:31,004 --> 00:00:35,529This title came from a WHO publication on developing interventions1000:00:35,721 --> 00:00:38,596to emphasize that we must anticipate scaling up1100:00:38,790 --> 00:00:41,852when developing the approach and we must understand the evidence1200:00:42,064 --> 00:00:45,902that policy makers and implementers are going to need.1300:00:46,102 --> 00:00:48,111In this chapter, we will hear1400:00:48,336 --> 00:00:51,336the perspective of the control programme manager,1500:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,590a policy maker, the donor agencies and the researchers.1600:00:55,837 --> 00:00:59,912And we will look at these key activities:1700:01:00,234 --> 00:01:03,909dissemination of the findings and advocacy for policy change1800:01:04,096 --> 00:01:07,097including the strategy in the national strategic1900:01:07,507 --> 00:01:11,069plan for control, and this is a key step for securing funding;2000:01:11,329 --> 00:01:13,217and then there are the organizational steps2100:01:13,395 --> 00:01:16,395for preparing for implementation, and we'll hear about some2200:01:16,637 --> 00:01:18,359of the challenges that have been encountered.2300:01:18,570 --> 00:01:21,170And finally, monitoring and evaluation,2400:01:21,354 --> 00:01:25,641which may identify gaps leading in turn, to further research.2500:01:26,018 --> 00:01:29,380And we'll see that each of these steps involves partnership between2600:01:29,567 --> 00:01:33,542implementers and researchers to support effective scale up.2700:01:33,714 --> 00:01:37,614There was a rapid uptake of this intervention by countries,2800:01:37,810 --> 00:01:42,185and I think part of what facilitated that was2900:01:42,377 --> 00:01:47,227the very clearly defined operation research3000:01:47,412 --> 00:01:50,812questions and issues that were answered during3100:01:50,985 --> 00:01:53,298this strategy's development phase.3200:01:53,511 --> 00:01:57,148A lot of the questions of: "How do I implement this?"3300:01:57,334 --> 00:01:58,309"What do I do?"3400:01:58,501 --> 00:02:00,826"Is it through the community health worker, is it a fixed point?"3500:02:01,022 --> 00:02:02,635"How do I give the drugs?"3600:02:02,810 --> 00:02:04,810"Do I give the drugs to mothers?3700:02:05,007 --> 00:02:06,682"Would they tolerate it, would they take it etc.?" 3800:02:06,863 --> 00:02:08,794were answered already.3900:02:09,186 --> 00:02:11,373So these were not bottlenecks anymore4000:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,348that individual countries had to answer4100:02:13,548 --> 00:02:16,851because this well mapped out operation research had4200:02:17,108 --> 00:02:18,558already answered most of those questions4300:02:18,740 --> 00:02:23,440so it helped in developing a very clear implementation guide4400:02:23,860 --> 00:02:27,285trying to answer most of the questions that would arise4500:02:27,484 --> 00:02:31,299in real life. And that helped in the uptake of the intervention.4600:02:31,477 --> 00:02:33,965And I think, one last point I should make4700:02:34,165 --> 00:02:39,744which we should not overlook was that4800:02:40,016 --> 00:02:42,067the researchers, or the research community4900:02:42,444 --> 00:02:50,306was also heavily involved not just in undertaking the research5000:02:50,500 --> 00:02:53,025stories needed for policy to be made5100:02:53,544 --> 00:02:57,057but also the transition from policy recommendation5200:02:57,363 --> 00:02:58,901to implementation.5300:02:59,080 --> 00:03:03,767They were actually actively involved in supporting countries.5400:03:04,921 --> 00:03:07,497Roll Back Malaria is a worldwide partnership5500:03:07,697 --> 00:03:11,159created by the WHO,5600:03:11,359 --> 00:03:14,834the UNICEF, the UNDP, and the World Bank to start with.5700:03:15,034 --> 00:03:19,887It was just to harmonize all the interventions,5800:03:20,087 --> 00:03:21,251all the actions,5900:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,384all the programmes against malaria6000:03:25,584 --> 00:03:26,527worldwide.6100:03:26,727 --> 00:03:30,286We obtained very good results in Mali and Senegal6200:03:30,486 --> 00:03:32,138so, we forged ahead !6300:03:32,338 --> 00:03:34,286So it was a study with countries,6400:03:34,486 --> 00:03:36,150we created working groups with the countries6500:03:36,350 --> 00:03:39,509saying ok: how to implement this? what to do?6600:03:39,709 --> 00:03:44,337With this partnership, with all partners committed to this strategy6700:03:44,537 --> 00:03:46,304we had decided6800:03:46,504 --> 00:03:49,243to create a coordination structure6900:03:49,443 --> 00:03:53,113to help the countries to implement this intervention.7000:03:53,313 --> 00:03:59,752Our role was, first of all, to gather all the countries7100:03:59,952 --> 00:04:02,453to share, to inform7200:04:02,653 --> 00:04:05,016about this new policy, about the new strategy7300:04:05,216 --> 00:04:08,282so they could understand all the work we'd done beforehand.7400:04:08,482 --> 00:04:12,248Secondly, to help them7500:04:12,448 --> 00:04:13,919to implement strategies7600:04:14,119 --> 00:04:17,599to do effective advocacy in their country so it would be adopted7700:04:17,745 --> 00:04:20,677and integrated into their national strategy.7800:04:20,877 --> 00:04:24,997Because it is very important that an intervention7900:04:25,197 --> 00:04:27,747becomes part of national policies8000:04:27,947 --> 00:04:29,520and national strategies.8100:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,954And also to help them set up programmes,8200:04:32,154 --> 00:04:35,808organize their implementation plans,8300:04:36,008 --> 00:04:39,043because the first step being8400:04:39,243 --> 00:04:41,016adoption of the strategy,8500:04:41,216 --> 00:04:45,330afterwards you have to think about all the implementation steps.8600:04:45,671 --> 00:04:46,615With a good initiative,8700:04:47,154 --> 00:04:49,799a politician might say ok,8800:04:50,060 --> 00:04:55,136we have to put this in my village next!8900:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,632We had to restrain the countries and say no, be careful,9000:04:57,783 --> 00:05:01,537this initiative applies in such conditions, in such zones,9100:05:01,737 --> 00:05:04,737in such districts, because you have to meet these criteria.9200:05:05,126 --> 00:05:08,301Clear criteria may be needed as Claude Emile has just said for9300:05:08,491 --> 00:05:11,341where and when to deploy the intervention.9400:05:11,534 --> 00:05:14,309These criteria may be based on disease burden9500:05:14,943 --> 00:05:18,780and also on the health system capacity and community demand.9600:05:18,948 --> 00:05:22,348In the case of SMC, criteria were developed to guide9700:05:22,541 --> 00:05:25,541the selection of target areas, where the impact would be greatest.9800:05:25,888 --> 00:05:29,513The intervention is intended for areas with very seasonal9900:05:29,701 --> 00:05:33,438transmission and within those areas the cost per case10000:05:33,617 --> 00:05:36,417averted decreases as the preventable10100:05:36,604 --> 00:05:39,266disease burden increases.10200:05:39,471 --> 00:05:43,233And the cost-effectiveness was predicted to be very attractive10300:05:43,454 --> 00:05:47,679in areas where incidence of disease was at least 10%.10400:05:47,861 --> 00:05:50,948And in these areas, the main burden of malaria10500:05:51,128 --> 00:05:53,965occurs in young children in a few months of the year10600:05:54,148 --> 00:05:57,373so intervention targeted to this period and age group10700:05:57,574 --> 00:06:00,962could prevent a large proportion of the total burden.10800:06:01,368 --> 00:06:03,980These criteria help programme managers10900:06:04,177 --> 00:06:06,089 to plan rational implementation,11000:06:06,282 --> 00:06:09,507prioritizing the areas where the intervention will have11100:06:09,679 --> 00:06:11,179greatest impact.11200:06:11,408 --> 00:06:14,858Mady   Ba was the coordinator of the National Malaria Control Programme11300:06:15,055 --> 00:06:17,555in Senegal when  SMC was introduced.11400:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,009And he'll explain now how the policy was adapted11500:06:21,186 --> 00:06:23,136to the local context.11600:06:24,681 --> 00:06:28,8962012 was a very important year for Senegal11700:06:29,096 --> 00:06:32,559because WHO11800:06:32,984 --> 00:06:35,720had drafted a recommendation11900:06:35,920 --> 00:06:41,567encouraging countries to use SMC12000:06:41,767 --> 00:06:46,676to reduce morbidity in children under 5 years old.12100:06:46,876 --> 00:06:49,646Senegal, like many countries12200:06:49,846 --> 00:06:53,824thought it necessary to include this recommendation12300:06:54,024 --> 00:06:57,381in its care and prevention policy12400:06:57,581 --> 00:07:01,541and for that it was necessary12500:07:01,741 --> 00:07:03,200to adapt the policy12600:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,044to integrate the recommendation.12700:07:06,244 --> 00:07:08,629I think we were lucky12800:07:08,829 --> 00:07:11,551that our researchers12900:07:11,788 --> 00:07:14,037had contributed to this recommendation13000:07:14,237 --> 00:07:21,057because a lot of research had been done on SMC in Senegal.13100:07:21,257 --> 00:07:23,208So we had evidence13200:07:23,408 --> 00:07:26,325to build our advocacy13300:07:26,525 --> 00:07:28,459and convince the authorities13400:07:28,659 --> 00:07:30,294to introduce this recommendation.13500:07:30,494 --> 00:07:33,556And even better, we had a scientific committee13600:07:33,756 --> 00:07:34,990on the programme13700:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,078chaired by the Prof. Oumar Gaye13800:07:38,278 --> 00:07:41,567that gathered all research institutions13900:07:41,767 --> 00:07:43,341of the country14000:07:45,785 --> 00:07:48,571with the partners who   are working in fighting malaria.14100:07:48,771 --> 00:07:51,657So we had several workshops14200:07:51,857 --> 00:07:54,756to develop the arguments14300:07:54,956 --> 00:07:56,908showing our expertise14400:07:57,108 --> 00:07:59,643and the research that had been done14500:07:59,868 --> 00:08:02,768to better establish the recommendation14600:08:02,968 --> 00:08:05,390and introduce it in the document.14700:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,473And that was all the more needed because Senegal wanted to14800:08:12,061 --> 00:08:13,007go further14900:08:13,207 --> 00:08:16,352because this recommendation concerned chidren from 3 months to  5 years15000:08:18,637 --> 00:08:21,681But we had knowledge that15100:08:21,881 --> 00:08:23,446our epidemiologic profile15200:08:23,646 --> 00:08:25,958tended to include15300:08:26,158 --> 00:08:27,320children up to 10 years.15400:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,656So to be effective we needed15500:08:29,856 --> 00:08:33,221to take the recommendation and adapt it to our context15600:08:33,421 --> 00:08:35,434by including children up to 10.15700:08:35,635 --> 00:08:37,350And that was done,15800:08:37,549 --> 00:08:39,364the advocacy was built15900:08:39,563 --> 00:08:41,140and validated by the committee16000:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,369and we had submitted the arguments to the appropriate authority,16100:08:43,568 --> 00:08:45,913the Ministry of Health and Social Action.16200:08:46,113 --> 00:08:47,49316300:08:47,693 --> 00:08:51,092We also had to show that we had partners16400:08:51,292 --> 00:08:54,857that could help, to buy the drugs, etc.16500:08:55,068 --> 00:08:57,106This partnership that Mady Ba describes16600:08:57,286 --> 00:09:00,036between the national programme and the research community16700:09:00,213 --> 00:09:03,088works both ways of course. It helps keep research relevant16800:09:03,277 --> 00:09:05,414and focused on the public health problems16900:09:05,654 --> 00:09:09,004and the researchers are able to provide the evidence needed17000:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,118to advocate the new policies.17100:09:12,334 --> 00:09:16,171Peter Olumese and then Oumar Gaye from the University Cheikh Anta Diop17200:09:16,390 --> 00:09:19,240will give some examples of this.17300:09:26,451 --> 00:09:30,426 Having the policy makers, the researchers and the implementers work together is so key, whether it is developing the strategy17400:09:30,616 --> 00:09:33,553or translating that to implementation or [the]17500:09:33,754 --> 00:09:35,129actual implementation phase,17600:09:35,322 --> 00:09:38,497it is key to have all these parties work together17700:09:38,727 --> 00:09:41,139to have the resources that we need to acquire.17800:09:41,339 --> 00:09:44,339Here you're in the parasitology department17900:09:44,539 --> 00:09:46,899of the medical school of the University Cheikh Anta Diop18000:09:47,099 --> 00:09:51,881that has a long tradition of research in partnership with the Ministry of Health.18100:09:52,081 --> 00:09:54,869Here, with respect to in the university18200:09:55,069 --> 00:09:58,118it's the reproach that is often made to academics:18300:09:58,318 --> 00:10:00,158that they do abstract research,18400:10:00,358 --> 00:10:04,919that they have no grip on reality, on the actual  implementation,18500:10:05,119 --> 00:10:08,947but the feature of this service 18600:10:09,147 --> 00:10:12,876with this long tradition of partnership with the Ministry18700:10:14,856 --> 00:10:18,594is to anchor  its research activity18800:10:18,794 --> 00:10:21,406in the concerns of the Ministry of Health.18900:10:21,606 --> 00:10:24,229So I can give you examples.19000:10:24,429 --> 00:10:26,540Let's take malaria.19100:10:26,740 --> 00:10:33,145Firstly, it was  our mentor, Prof. Samba Diallo, who in the early 1970s19200:10:33,345 --> 00:10:37,694showed that inopportune  chloroquinization19300:10:37,894 --> 00:10:42,375could have negative impacts on immunity and on resistance to chloroquine.19400:10:42,575 --> 00:10:45,232And this continued with us too19500:10:45,432 --> 00:10:48,884by putting in place surveillance systems19600:10:49,084 --> 00:10:51,323on the therapeutic effectiveness of sentinel sites.19700:10:51,523 --> 00:10:55,507We've also proven that is was possible19800:10:55,707 --> 00:10:59,618to use rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) not only at the hospitals but also  in the community.19900:11:01,447 --> 00:11:04,733And it's also our research that allowed the national programme20000:11:04,933 --> 00:11:07,240to spread the use of RDTs20100:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,817and Senegal is one of the first countries which democratized the fight against malaria,20200:11:13,903 --> 00:11:15,639bringing it to peripheral zones.20300:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,723We also had to commit to other preventive strategies.20400:11:20,923 --> 00:11:23,241Senegal was the first French speaking country20500:11:23,441 --> 00:11:26,041to have changed  chloroquine20600:11:26,241 --> 00:11:27,958to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for pregnant women.20700:11:30,867 --> 00:11:33,469So here are real  life examples20800:11:33,669 --> 00:11:37,635of what research can do for implementation.20900:11:45,523 --> 00:11:46,972Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention , called SMC:21000:11:47,172 --> 00:11:49,387we've also contributed21100:11:49,587 --> 00:11:52,294by undertaking research in the field21200:11:52,494 --> 00:11:54,357and by putting it to scale.21300:11:54,557 --> 00:11:57,026We now work in a multidisciplinary manner21400:11:57,226 --> 00:12:00,257with all colleagues from the university,21500:12:00,457 --> 00:12:02,692be it sociologists from the Faculty of  Humanities21600:12:02,892 --> 00:12:06,024or economists from the Faculty of Economics21700:12:06,224 --> 00:12:08,418 or  epidemiologists.21800:12:08,618 --> 00:12:12,148We also work with other research institutes such as IRD  and the Pasteur Institute.21900:12:12,348 --> 00:12:14,369So these multidisciplinary teams22000:12:14,569 --> 00:12:17,013belonging to several institutes22100:12:17,213 --> 00:12:19,582that have produced quality research22200:12:19,782 --> 00:12:21,534on a fundamental level22300:12:21,734 --> 00:12:23,658in the lab as here, or in the field22400:12:23,858 --> 00:12:27,046by working with the personnel of the Ministry of Health,22500:12:27,246 --> 00:12:28,723they have produced results.22600:12:31,992 --> 00:12:34,241We have the tools.22700:12:34,441 --> 00:12:37,370We have the resources.22800:12:37,570 --> 00:12:39,328But despite this22900:12:39,528 --> 00:12:44,077we can't have a real scale implementation.23000:12:44,277 --> 00:12:45,801We don't think of everything,23100:12:46,001 --> 00:12:50,510and we find ourselves faced with bottlenecks23200:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,880that stop us from making progress.23300:12:53,080 --> 00:12:56,574The bottlenecks may appear at any level23400:12:56,774 --> 00:12:59,873be it from the health system, the organization,23500:13:00,073 --> 00:13:01,797the population23600:13:01,997 --> 00:13:05,348or even the health agents who were not adequately prepared 23700:13:05,548 --> 00:13:08,939or whose opinions were not taken into account.23800:13:09,139 --> 00:13:10,666Sadly, in 201323900:13:10,866 --> 00:13:13,722we faced a few difficulties.24000:13:13,922 --> 00:13:16,508The first was the availability of the drug24100:13:16,708 --> 00:13:19,563because there was only one supplier worldwide24200:13:19,813 --> 00:13:24,510that had the WHO pre-qualification24300:13:24,642 --> 00:13:26,257and our partners24400:13:26,457 --> 00:13:29,457would only buy pre-qualified drugs.24500:13:29,657 --> 00:13:34,914But, these drugs that our supplier had24600:13:35,104 --> 00:13:38,575did not have a national marketing authorization.24700:13:38,775 --> 00:13:41,152So we had to solve this problem24800:13:41,352 --> 00:13:43,976 but  paperwork24900:13:44,176 --> 00:13:45,739takes time.25000:13:45,939 --> 00:13:47,661And when we realized this25100:13:47,861 --> 00:13:52,762it impacted the date on which we could start the intervention25200:13:52,962 --> 00:13:56,805because another constraint of this intervention25300:13:57,005 --> 00:14:00,980is that is has to be undertaken during a specific period of the year,25400:14:01,180 --> 00:14:03,081it's the high transmission period,25500:14:03,281 --> 00:14:06,369to cover the period when the intervention is most timely.25600:14:06,569 --> 00:14:13,243So we were not able to do all the eligible regions25700:14:13,443 --> 00:14:14,589because there were four25800:14:14,789 --> 00:14:16,968and you'll understand that25900:14:17,168 --> 00:14:20,168you need a good quantification method for a successful campaign.26000:14:20,358 --> 00:14:22,342And regarding this quantification,26100:14:22,542 --> 00:14:25,541when we started this campaign26200:14:25,741 --> 00:14:29,337we needed to base ourselves on the theoretical populations26300:14:29,537 --> 00:14:32,287that we’re accustomed to consider, stemming26400:14:32,487 --> 00:14:36,660from our census, with all the flaws26500:14:36,860 --> 00:14:40,677that we have with national census data.26600:14:40,877 --> 00:14:43,566So we worked with these theoretical populations26700:14:43,766 --> 00:14:47,415trying to see which proportions,26800:14:47,615 --> 00:14:49,694as given in the documents,26900:14:49,894 --> 00:14:53,670represented the targeted populations.27000:14:53,870 --> 00:14:56,870We quantified our need on the basis27100:14:57,197 --> 00:14:58,691of these targets27200:14:58,891 --> 00:15:03,740inflating it with a security percentage27300:15:03,940 --> 00:15:06,462of over 10%27400:15:06,662 --> 00:15:09,293which allowed us to be more at ease27500:15:09,493 --> 00:15:11,390with the idea that27600:15:11,590 --> 00:15:15,613we could find that the real population27700:15:15,813 --> 00:15:17,264was much higher.27800:15:17,464 --> 00:15:20,884On the first campaign, we worked on this principle.27900:15:21,084 --> 00:15:23,012We said to ourselves28000:15:23,212 --> 00:15:24,825when we do the campaign28100:15:24,962 --> 00:15:29,687the data we collect from this census, because we were going door to door,28200:15:29,887 --> 00:15:33,230actually counting the children,28300:15:33,430 --> 00:15:37,070this data would be useful for future campaigns.28400:15:37,262 --> 00:15:39,200As Mady Ba explained there28500:15:39,390 --> 00:15:43,077there were a number of implementation challenges28600:15:43,264 --> 00:15:45,964and similar issues were encountered in other countries:28700:15:46,139 --> 00:15:50,776the supply of quality assured drugs was not able to meet the rapid demand28800:15:50,985 --> 00:15:54,885as costs of the drugs rose, the tablets were difficult to use,28900:15:55,058 --> 00:15:58,633dispersible formulations became available but only later,29000:15:58,823 --> 00:16:02,223and it was difficult to quantify the number of treatments29100:16:02,417 --> 00:16:05,067that were needed, the size of the population to be treated often29200:16:05,264 --> 00:16:07,027being underestimated.29300:16:07,326 --> 00:16:09,889Distributing drugs in the remote areas in the rainy season29400:16:10,064 --> 00:16:13,427was often problematic and putting in place effective29500:16:13,622 --> 00:16:15,759pharmacovigilance was challenging.29600:16:15,962 --> 00:16:21,125Good monitoring and evaluation is crucial in the early phases,29700:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,262it's needed to detect and resolve problems in scale-up29800:16:24,441 --> 00:16:27,691and in later phases it's important to ensure that29900:16:27,876 --> 00:16:31,051delivery is being maintained effectively.30000:16:32,955 --> 00:16:35,955And the methods that are used in monitoring may themselves30100:16:36,829 --> 00:16:40,654need to be the topic of research to develop appropriate tools30200:16:40,844 --> 00:16:43,844as Jean Louis NDiaye now explains.30300:16:46,159 --> 00:16:48,531The challenges for the implementation30400:16:48,731 --> 00:16:51,116are to to be able to have a good follow up.30500:16:51,316 --> 00:16:55,481Because if we had a very good efficacy rate,30600:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,567over 80% of protection,30700:16:58,767 --> 00:17:02,453it is important to always maintain this efficacy.30800:17:02,653 --> 00:17:04,842By increasing the drug pressure30900:17:05,041 --> 00:17:09,098we could expect to see an increase in molecular resistance markers.31000:17:09,298 --> 00:17:13,141So we have a chemo-resistance follow up protocol31100:17:13,340 --> 00:17:17,743by taking samples from eligible children31200:17:17,944 --> 00:17:21,582during the seasonal malaria prevention,31300:17:21,781 --> 00:17:23,463but also after chemoprevention31400:17:23,636 --> 00:17:25,694to see if there was an increase31500:17:25,894 --> 00:17:28,106of molecular resistance markers.31600:17:28,306 --> 00:17:30,139Regarding the coverage,31700:17:30,339 --> 00:17:34,269coverage studies show very satisfying rates31800:17:34,469 --> 00:17:36,576except in some zones including31900:17:36,776 --> 00:17:39,686the region of Kedougou where there are traditional gold mines32000:17:39,886 --> 00:17:42,245and zones that are hard to reach32100:17:42,445 --> 00:17:43,664in the Kolda region.32200:17:43,864 --> 00:17:47,457So the committee in charge of the strategy32300:17:47,657 --> 00:17:49,556put together innovative strategies32400:17:49,756 --> 00:17:51,957trying to go and administer32500:17:52,157 --> 00:17:54,804the drugs in traditional gold mines.32600:17:55,004 --> 00:17:56,307and finding ways32700:17:56,507 --> 00:17:58,855to increase coverage in the most remote areas.32800:17:59,175 --> 00:18:01,778So like in every campaign32900:18:02,006 --> 00:18:04,699there is important work on safety monitoring33000:18:04,899 --> 00:18:06,285to be done.33100:18:06,485 --> 00:18:08,157And this  safety monitoring33200:18:08,357 --> 00:18:10,603is very important because it allows for33300:18:10,803 --> 00:18:16,002strengthening of the health system’s trust in 33400:18:16,202 --> 00:18:18,838the population33500:18:19,038 --> 00:18:21,352but also for prevention33600:18:21,552 --> 00:18:22,962and care with regard to 33700:18:23,162 --> 00:18:25,272any undesirable side effects.33800:18:25,608 --> 00:18:28,333We know that in Africa, in many countries,33900:18:28,533 --> 00:18:32,763a functional drug  safety monitoring system is a challenge.34000:18:32,963 --> 00:18:35,963So we used34100:18:36,163 --> 00:18:40,097the strategies we had developed during our implementation research phase,34200:18:40,297 --> 00:18:44,646including the training of health providers on safety monitoring and34300:18:44,846 --> 00:18:46,949the use of methods,34400:18:47,149 --> 00:18:48,286either phones34500:18:48,486 --> 00:18:50,501or calendars34600:18:50,701 --> 00:18:52,815to remind the agents34700:18:53,015 --> 00:18:55,914to always explain to the people34800:18:56,114 --> 00:18:58,333who take the treatment that they should report any side effects 34900:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,251that could occur following the treatment35000:19:01,451 --> 00:19:03,929.35100:19:04,129 --> 00:19:07,446This was one of the challenges of implementing this strategy.35200:19:07,646 --> 00:19:10,403Alongside this national drug safety monitoring system35300:19:10,603 --> 00:19:15,003that is mostly based on the passive notification35400:19:15,203 --> 00:19:16,238of undesirable effects,35500:19:16,438 --> 00:19:17,906new strategies35600:19:18,043 --> 00:19:20,883aiming to  improve  safety monitoring35700:19:21,115 --> 00:19:22,409were implemented.35800:19:22,609 --> 00:19:23,775Notably in Senegal35900:19:23,975 --> 00:19:26,290thanks to funds from the WHO TDR,36000:19:26,490 --> 00:19:31,348we were able to set up an active safety monitoring system in one district36100:19:31,548 --> 00:19:33,731 and improve notification process36200:19:33,931 --> 00:19:37,983by using cellular phones, smart phones36300:19:38,183 --> 00:19:42,198which led to 36400:19:42,398 --> 00:19:45,199 better notification of side effects36500:19:45,555 --> 00:19:47,007in Senegal.36600:19:49,168 --> 00:19:50,23136700:19:50,425 --> 00:19:51,687Countries begin to ask us:36800:19:51,881 --> 00:19:53,906"When do I stop this?"36900:19:54,106 --> 00:19:57,037A lot of this can only come from implementation research37000:19:57,237 --> 00:19:58,789so we needed researchers37100:19:58,942 --> 00:20:02,205to keep looking at… at what point do we say:37200:20:02,395 --> 00:20:04,357"This is no longer cost effective."37300:20:04,535 --> 00:20:05,935At what point do we say that:37400:20:06,107 --> 00:20:06,719"Oh for 37500:20:06,900 --> 00:20:10,475this particular epidemiological situation it’s no longer effective,37600:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,682you need to change."37700:20:11,854 --> 00:20:13,554We don't have that, we don't have those answers37800:20:13,754 --> 00:20:16,802so there are still unanswered questions, so we still need37900:20:17,042 --> 00:20:22,005specific well designed operational research and implementation research38000:20:22,184 --> 00:20:24,734to answer some of these questions.38100:20:24,933 --> 00:20:27,517Even for us at UNICEF38200:20:27,717 --> 00:20:29,738it's not always a priority for the donors38300:20:32,763 --> 00:20:35,072and it's harder to raise funds38400:20:35,272 --> 00:20:37,421for this research that is nevertheless essential38500:20:37,621 --> 00:20:40,252because it allows us38600:20:40,452 --> 00:20:42,260to then have these interventions38700:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,854that save lives38800:20:44,054 --> 00:20:45,661on a global scale.38900:20:45,861 --> 00:20:48,629And we find that it's difficult.39000:20:48,829 --> 00:20:52,359It's easier to find funds to buy vaccines,39100:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,656vitamin A or mosquito nets39200:20:54,856 --> 00:20:56,648than to  find funds to do research.39300:20:56,848 --> 00:20:59,607Yet, it's very important39400:20:59,807 --> 00:21:04,526It's important that all the partners who support the countries39500:21:04,763 --> 00:21:07,055in the adoption of policies and interventions39600:21:07,255 --> 00:21:09,233and  in  building  their plans or large scale implementation39700:21:09,433 --> 00:21:15,887that they not forget to mobilize resources for this operational research39800:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,832that allows us to obtain tools,39900:21:19,032 --> 00:21:20,480solutions,40000:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,094to resolve the bottlenecks or challenges that we may face.40100:21:25,294 --> 00:21:28,744Whether it’s UNICEF or others,40200:21:28,944 --> 00:21:32,922it's so important to keep  up advocacy40300:21:33,122 --> 00:21:36,574and maintain budget lines40400:21:36,774 --> 00:21:39,774for this  critical step.40500:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,782The theme of this MOOC has been that40600:21:42,982 --> 00:21:45,982effective interventions are often underexploited40700:21:46,244 --> 00:21:48,444because of difficulties in delivery40800:21:48,634 --> 00:21:51,284and often the implementation problems are greatest40900:21:51,472 --> 00:21:53,422exactly in those situations where41000:21:53,594 --> 00:21:56,206the interventions are the most needed.41100:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,853Marie Reine highlighted that research to find ways41200:22:00,033 --> 00:22:03,370to solve these implementation problems is a top priority.41300:22:06,745 --> 00:22:08,608 In this module, we’ve reviewed some of the approaches that have been successful.41400:22:08,799 --> 00:22:11,886In chapter two we saw that it's important to test strategies41500:22:12,064 --> 00:22:14,651in different situations, small pilot studies41600:22:14,836 --> 00:22:18,861need  to be followed by larger scale assessments in a range of settings.41700:22:19,048 --> 00:22:22,485And we saw some of the methods that may be used to measure key outcomes41800:22:22,685 --> 00:22:26,608such as fidelity, acceptability, coverage and cost.41900:22:27,150 --> 00:22:30,150And we saw examples of study design that maybe used42000:22:30,352 --> 00:22:33,102depending on the research question to be addressed.42100:22:33,911 --> 00:22:36,786And we saw the importance of the partnership42200:22:36,988 --> 00:22:38,388between the researchers,42300:22:38,577 --> 00:22:41,577the implementers, and the policy makers.42400:22:41,798 --> 00:22:43,636And then in chapter three, we've heard about some42500:22:43,838 --> 00:22:46,451successes and challenges in scaling up interventions42600:22:46,649 --> 00:22:49,037and the importance of robust monitoring42700:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,614and evaluation during the scale up phase42800:22:51,834 --> 00:22:54,996and later to ensure effective delivery is maintained42900:22:55,202 --> 00:22:58,889and to identify when strategies may need to change.43000:22:59,506 --> 00:23:03,681The situation in infectious diseases is an evolving one.43100:23:03,889 --> 00:23:08,164Strategies may need to be adapted, or as Peter Olumese argued,43200:23:08,361 --> 00:23:11,599replaced with new tools as the epidemiological situation43300:23:11,802 --> 00:23:15,202changes or as progress is made towards the goal of43400:23:15,374 --> 00:23:17,161the elimination of the disease.43500:23:17,361 --> 00:23:22,133We hope that you found this module useful. If you're involved in implementation research43600:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,787we hope the module has been interesting to you.43700:23:25,021 --> 00:23:27,171If you're not involved in implementation research43800:23:27,357 --> 00:23:30,732we hope this module has shown that implementation science43900:23:30,918 --> 00:23:34,268is an important and rewarding area of research44000:23:34,453 --> 00:23:36,841and will encourage you to become involved.44100:23:37,054 --> 00:23:41,004The last part of this module requires your participation.44200:23:41,204 --> 00:23:45,325We'd like you to identify an implementation problem44300:23:45,582 --> 00:23:48,582and prepare a short outline of your proposal44400:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,445for a research project to solve it.44500:23:51,635 --> 00:23:54,635Choose a topic that's close to your own experience.44600:23:54,909 --> 00:23:57,371It can be related to a topic that was referred to by44700:23:57,565 --> 00:24:00,165one of our speakers, but you should avoid44800:24:00,354 --> 00:24:03,554taking a whole example directly from the course.44900:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,671And your proposal should include four sections.45000:24:08,489 --> 00:24:12,027We would like you to state the implementation problem,45100:24:12,227 --> 00:24:15,408define the implementation approach,45200:24:15,608 --> 00:24:17,842prepare a conceptual diagram,45300:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,493and list the outcomes to be assessed.
