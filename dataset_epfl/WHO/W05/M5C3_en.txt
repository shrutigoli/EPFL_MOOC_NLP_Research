Welcome to chapter three and congratulations on reaching this final chapter of the MOOC.
The objective of implementation research is to get good interventions into widespread effective use and so it's appropriate that this final chapter is about scaling up.
The previous chapter was about applying the methods of implementation research in practice and our theme was â€œBeginning with the end in mindâ€�.
This title came from a WHO publication on developing interventions to emphasize that we must anticipate scaling up when developing the approach and we must understand the evidence that policy makers and implementers are going to need.
In this chapter, we will hear the perspective of the control programme manager, a policy maker, the donor agencies and the researchers.
And we will look at these key activities: dissemination of the findings and advocacy for policy change including the strategy in the national strategic plan for control, and this is a key step for securing funding; and then there are the organizational steps for preparing for implementation, and we'll hear about some of the challenges that have been encountered.
And finally, monitoring and evaluation, which may identify gaps leading in turn, to further research.
And we'll see that each of these steps involves partnership between implementers and researchers to support effective scale up.
There was a rapid uptake of this intervention by countries, and I think part of what facilitated that was the very clearly defined operation research questions and issues that were answered during this strategy's development phase.
A lot of the questions of: "How do I implement this?"
"What do I do?"
"Is it through the community health worker, is it a fixed point?"
"How do I give the drugs?"
"Do I give the drugs to mothers?
"Would they tolerate it, would they take it etc.?" were answered already.
So these were not bottlenecks anymore that individual countries had to answer because this well mapped out operation research had already answered most of those questions so it helped in developing a very clear implementation guide trying to answer most of the questions that would arise in real life. And that helped in the uptake of the intervention.
And I think, one last point I should make which we should not overlook was that the researchers, or the research community was also heavily involved not just in undertaking the research stories needed for policy to be made but also the transition from policy recommendation to implementation.
They were actually actively involved in supporting countries.
Roll Back Malaria is a worldwide partnership created by the WHO, the UNICEF, the UNDP, and the World Bank to start with.
It was just to harmonize all the interventions, all the actions, all the programmes against malaria worldwide.
We obtained very good results in Mali and Senegal so, we forged ahead !
So it was a study with countries, we created working groups with the countries saying ok: how to implement this? what to do?
With this partnership, with all partners committed to this strategy we had decided to create a coordination structure to help the countries to implement this intervention.
Our role was, first of all, to gather all the countries to share, to inform about this new policy, about the new strategy so they could understand all the work we'd done beforehand.
Secondly, to help them to implement strategies to do effective advocacy in their country so it would be adopted and integrated into their national strategy.
Because it is very important that an intervention becomes part of national policies and national strategies.
And also to help them set up programmes, organize their implementation plans, because the first step being adoption of the strategy, afterwards you have to think about all the implementation steps.
With a good initiative, a politician might say ok, we have to put this in my village next!
We had to restrain the countries and say no, be careful, this initiative applies in such conditions, in such zones, in such districts, because you have to meet these criteria.
Clear criteria may be needed as Claude Emile has just said for where and when to deploy the intervention.
These criteria may be based on disease burden and also on the health system capacity and community demand.
In the case of SMC, criteria were developed to guide the selection of target areas, where the impact would be greatest.
The intervention is intended for areas with very seasonal transmission and within those areas the cost per case averted decreases as the preventable disease burden increases.
And the cost-effectiveness was predicted to be very attractive in areas where incidence of disease was at least 10%.
And in these areas, the main burden of malaria occurs in young children in a few months of the year so intervention targeted to this period and age group could prevent a large proportion of the total burden.
These criteria help programme managers
to plan rational implementation, prioritizing the areas where the intervention will have greatest impact.
Mady   Ba was the coordinator of the National Malaria Control Programme in Senegal when  SMC was introduced.
And he'll explain now how the policy was adapted to the local context.
2012 was a very important year for Senegal because WHO had drafted a recommendation encouraging countries to use SMC to reduce morbidity in children under 5 years old.
Senegal, like many countries thought it necessary to include this recommendation in its care and prevention policy and for that it was necessary to adapt the policy to integrate the recommendation.
I think we were lucky that our researchers had contributed to this recommendation because a lot of research had been done on SMC in Senegal.
So we had evidence to build our advocacy and convince the authorities to introduce this recommendation.
And even better, we had a scientific committee on the programme chaired by the Prof. Oumar Gaye that gathered all research institutions of the country with the partners who   are working in fighting malaria.
So we had several workshops to develop the arguments showing our expertise and the research that had been done to better establish the recommendation and introduce it in the document.
And that was all the more needed because Senegal wanted to go further because this recommendation concerned chidren from 3 months to  5 years
But we had knowledge that our epidemiologic profile tended to include children up to 10 years.
So to be effective we needed to take the recommendation and adapt it to our context by including children up to 10.
And that was done, the advocacy was built and validated by the committee and we had submitted the arguments to the appropriate authority, the Ministry of Health and Social Action.
We also had to show that we had partners that could help, to buy the drugs, etc.
This partnership that Mady Ba describes between the national programme and the research community works both ways of course. It helps keep research relevant and focused on the public health problems and the researchers are able to provide the evidence needed to advocate the new policies.
Peter Olumese and then Oumar Gaye from the University Cheikh Anta Diop will give some examples of this.
Having the policy makers, the researchers and the implementers work together is so key, whether it is developing the strategy or translating that to implementation or [the] actual implementation phase, it is key to have all these parties work together to have the resources that we need to acquire.
Here you're in the parasitology department of the medical school of the University Cheikh Anta Diop that has a long tradition of research in partnership with the Ministry of Health.
Here, with respect to in the university it's the reproach that is often made to academics: that they do abstract research, that they have no grip on reality, on the actual  implementation, but the feature of this service with this long tradition of partnership with the Ministry is to anchor  its research activity in the concerns of the Ministry of Health.
So I can give you examples.
Let's take malaria.
Firstly, it was  our mentor, Prof. Samba Diallo, who in the early 1970s showed that inopportune  chloroquinization could have negative impacts on immunity and on resistance to chloroquine.
And this continued with us too by putting in place surveillance systems on the therapeutic effectiveness of sentinel sites.
We've also proven that is was possible to use rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) not only at the hospitals but also  in the community.
And it's also our research that allowed the national programme to spread the use of RDTs and Senegal is one of the first countries which democratized the fight against malaria, bringing it to peripheral zones.
We also had to commit to other preventive strategies.
Senegal was the first French speaking country to have changed  chloroquine to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine for pregnant women.
So here are real  life examples of what research can do for implementation.
Seasonal Malaria Chemoprevention , called SMC: we've also contributed by undertaking research in the field and by putting it to scale.
We now work in a multidisciplinary manner with all colleagues from the university, be it sociologists from the Faculty of  Humanities or economists from the Faculty of Economics
 or  epidemiologists.
We also work with other research institutes such as IRD  and the Pasteur Institute.
So these multidisciplinary teams belonging to several institutes that have produced quality research on a fundamental level in the lab as here, or in the field by working with the personnel of the Ministry of Health, they have produced results.
We have the tools.
We have the resources.
But despite this we can't have a real scale implementation.
We don't think of everything, and we find ourselves faced with bottlenecks that stop us from making progress.
The bottlenecks may appear at any level be it from the health system, the organization, the population or even the health agents who were not adequately prepared or whose opinions were not taken into account.
Sadly, in 2013 we faced a few difficulties.
The first was the availability of the drug because there was only one supplier worldwide that had the WHO pre-qualification and our partners would only buy pre-qualified drugs.
But, these drugs that our supplier had did not have a national marketing authorization.
So we had to solve this problem
but  paperwork takes time.
And when we realized this it impacted the date on which we could start the intervention because another constraint of this intervention is that is has to be undertaken during a specific period of the year, it's the high transmission period, to cover the period when the intervention is most timely.
So we were not able to do all the eligible regions because there were four and you'll understand that you need a good quantification method for a successful campaign.
And regarding this quantification, when we started this campaign we needed to base ourselves on the theoretical populations that weâ€™re accustomed to consider, stemming from our census, with all the flaws that we have with national census data.
So we worked with these theoretical populations trying to see which proportions, as given in the documents, represented the targeted populations.
We quantified our need on the basis of these targets inflating it with a security percentage of over 10% which allowed us to be more at ease with the idea that we could find that the real population was much higher.
On the first campaign, we worked on this principle.
We said to ourselves when we do the campaign the data we collect from this census, because we were going door to door, actually counting the children, this data would be useful for future campaigns.
As Mady Ba explained there there were a number of implementation challenges and similar issues were encountered in other countries: the supply of quality assured drugs was not able to meet the rapid demand as costs of the drugs rose, the tablets were difficult to use, dispersible formulations became available but only later, and it was difficult to quantify the number of treatments that were needed, the size of the population to be treated often being underestimated.
Distributing drugs in the remote areas in the rainy season was often problematic and putting in place effective pharmacovigilance was challenging.
Good monitoring and evaluation is crucial in the early phases, it's needed to detect and resolve problems in scale-up and in later phases it's important to ensure that delivery is being maintained effectively.
And the methods that are used in monitoring may themselves need to be the topic of research to develop appropriate tools as Jean Louis NDiaye now explains.
The challenges for the implementation are to to be able to have a good follow up.
Because if we had a very good efficacy rate, over 80% of protection, it is important to always maintain this efficacy.
By increasing the drug pressure we could expect to see an increase in molecular resistance markers.
So we have a chemo-resistance follow up protocol by taking samples from eligible children during the seasonal malaria prevention, but also after chemoprevention to see if there was an increase of molecular resistance markers.
Regarding the coverage, coverage studies show very satisfying rates except in some zones including the region of Kedougou where there are traditional gold mines and zones that are hard to reach in the Kolda region.
So the committee in charge of the strategy put together innovative strategies trying to go and administer the drugs in traditional gold mines. and finding ways to increase coverage in the most remote areas.
So like in every campaign there is important work on safety monitoring to be done.
And this  safety monitoring is very important because it allows for strengthening of the health systemâ€™s trust in the population but also for prevention and care with regard to any undesirable side effects.
We know that in Africa, in many countries, a functional drug  safety monitoring system is a challenge.
So we used the strategies we had developed during our implementation research phase, including the training of health providers on safety monitoring and the use of methods, either phones or calendars to remind the agents to always explain to the people who take the treatment that they should report any side effects that could occur following the treatment
This was one of the challenges of implementing this strategy.
Alongside this national drug safety monitoring system that is mostly based on the passive notification of undesirable effects, new strategies aiming to  improve  safety monitoring were implemented.
Notably in Senegal thanks to funds from the WHO TDR, we were able to set up an active safety monitoring system in one district
and improve notification process by using cellular phones, smart phones which led to 
better notification of side effects in Senegal.
Countries begin to ask us:
"When do I stop this?"
A lot of this can only come from implementation research so we needed researchers to keep looking atâ€¦ at what point do we say:
"This is no longer cost effective."
At what point do we say that:
"Oh for this particular epidemiological situation itâ€™s no longer effective, you need to change."
We don't have that, we don't have those answers so there are still unanswered questions, so we still need specific well designed operational research and implementation research to answer some of these questions.
Even for us at UNICEF it's not always a priority for the donors and it's harder to raise funds for this research that is nevertheless essential because it allows us to then have these interventions that save lives on a global scale.
And we find that it's difficult.
It's easier to find funds to buy vaccines, vitamin A or mosquito nets than to  find funds to do research.
Yet, it's very important
It's important that all the partners who support the countries in the adoption of policies and interventions and  in  building  their plans or large scale implementation that they not forget to mobilize resources for this operational research that allows us to obtain tools, solutions, to resolve the bottlenecks or challenges that we may face.
Whether itâ€™s UNICEF or others, it's so important to keep  up advocacy and maintain budget lines for this  critical step.
The theme of this MOOC has been that effective interventions are often underexploited because of difficulties in delivery and often the implementation problems are greatest exactly in those situations where the interventions are the most needed.
Marie Reine highlighted that research to find ways to solve these implementation problems is a top priority.
 In this module, weâ€™ve reviewed some of the approaches that have been successful.
In chapter two we saw that it's important to test strategies in different situations, small pilot studies need  to be followed by larger scale assessments in a range of settings.
And we saw some of the methods that may be used to measure key outcomes such as fidelity, acceptability, coverage and cost.
And we saw examples of study design that maybe used depending on the research question to be addressed.
And we saw the importance of the partnership between the researchers, the implementers, and the policy makers.
And then in chapter three, we've heard about some successes and challenges in scaling up interventions and the importance of robust monitoring and evaluation during the scale up phase and later to ensure effective delivery is maintained and to identify when strategies may need to change.
The situation in infectious diseases is an evolving one.
Strategies may need to be adapted, or as Peter Olumese argued, replaced with new tools as the epidemiological situation changes or as progress is made towards the goal of the elimination of the disease.
We hope that you found this module useful. If you're involved in implementation research we hope the module has been interesting to you.
If you're not involved in implementation research we hope this module has shown that implementation science is an important and rewarding area of research and will encourage you to become involved.
The last part of this module requires your participation.
We'd like you to identify an implementation problem and prepare a short outline of your proposal for a research project to solve it.
Choose a topic that's close to your own experience.
It can be related to a topic that was referred to by one of our speakers, but you should avoid taking a whole example directly from the course.
And your proposal should include four sections.
We would like you to state the implementation problem, define the implementation approach, prepare a conceptual diagram, and list the outcomes to be assessed.
