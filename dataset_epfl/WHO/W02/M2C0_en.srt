00:00:04,383 --> 00:00:07,383
Welcome to module two of the five modules

1
00:00:07,583 --> 00:00:11,395
of a massive open online course on implementation research

2
00:00:11,602 --> 00:00:13,427
developed by the Special Programme for

3
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:15,914
Research and Training in Tropical Diseases.

4
00:00:16,114 --> 00:00:19,114
This module will take you through how to assess the diversity

5
00:00:19,314 --> 00:00:21,659
of context and settings

6
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:24,859
in your implementation research projects.

7
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:29,268
Hello, my name is Pascale Allotey, professor of public health,

8
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:32,431
head of global public health, and associate director

9
00:00:32,631 --> 00:00:34,916
of the South East Asia Community Observatory

10
00:00:35,116 --> 00:00:37,665
at the Monash University campus in Malaysia

11
00:00:37,865 --> 00:00:41,115
As you may recall, module one introduced you

12
00:00:41,315 --> 00:00:44,228
to some of the key concepts of implementation research,

13
00:00:44,415 --> 00:00:47,728
and provided some key definitions and some memorable case studies.

14
00:00:47,928 --> 00:00:50,928
Building on the overview,

15
00:00:51,128 --> 00:00:54,128
one of the biggest challenges of implementation research is

16
00:00:54,328 --> 00:00:56,578
the diversity of the context in which

17
00:00:56,765 --> 00:00:58,961
implementation is supposed to occur.

18
00:00:59,161 --> 00:01:02,686
Context is often the important reason why, for instance,

19
00:01:02,886 --> 00:01:05,886
a project that may be successful in one place

20
00:01:06,086 --> 00:01:07,898
can fail miserably in another.

21
00:01:08,098 --> 00:01:11,098
Context is also one of the most important and underestimated,

22
00:01:11,298 --> 00:01:14,736
and yet most complex areas to understand,

23
00:01:14,936 --> 00:01:17,611
in undertaking implementation research.

24
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:20,811
The module will be presented to you by my colleagues,

25
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:24,011
Bill Brieger and Uche Amazigo.

26
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:26,734
Here is a quick illustration.

27
00:01:26,934 --> 00:01:30,655
We all live in a complex social, biological,

28
00:01:30,897 --> 00:01:33,009
political, and economic ecosystem.

29
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:37,195
This means that we're influenced by external factors.

30
00:01:37,395 --> 00:01:41,655
As individuals, we belong to households, neighborhoods,

31
00:01:41,855 --> 00:01:45,980
cultures, and religions; all with particular values and belief systems,

32
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,230
rules, regulations, and so on.

33
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:51,430
And these, in turn, dictate and determine

34
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:54,030
the infrastructure and processes

35
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:57,542
that facilitate or hinder the delivery of interventions.

36
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:01,142
And these rely on people, various stakeholders,

37
00:02:01,342 --> 00:02:05,287
service providers, policy makers, and so on,

38
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:09,403
who have the power and the resources to make things happen or not.

39
00:02:09,603 --> 00:02:13,214
How well all these align can make or break

40
00:02:13,414 --> 00:02:15,551
successful and sustained implementation

41
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:18,101
of efficacious interventions.

42
00:02:18,301 --> 00:02:19,688
In this module,

43
00:02:19,888 --> 00:02:22,888
Professor Bill Brieger and Professor  Uche Amazigo

44
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:26,676
will take you, systematically, through how to assess

45
00:02:26,876 --> 00:02:30,851
the context in which your intervention needs to be implemented

46
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,288
as a key component of implementation research.

47
00:02:34,551 --> 00:02:37,251
By the end of the module, you should be able to

48
00:02:37,451 --> 00:02:40,663
demonstrate how implementation research

49
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:43,863
needs are derived from programme settings,

50
00:02:44,063 --> 00:02:45,989
contexts, and experiences,

51
00:02:46,189 --> 00:02:50,868
and how to use these to design an implementation research project.

52
00:02:51,068 --> 00:02:53,543
By the end of the first chapter

53
00:02:53,743 --> 00:02:57,835
you should be able to define how settings and contexts

54
00:02:58,035 --> 00:03:02,690
influence implementation research through undertaking a needs assessment

55
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:07,096
After chapter two, you will be able to describe

56
00:03:07,296 --> 00:03:10,296
the methods and data sources used to determine

57
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:12,946
implementation research needs

58
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:16,035
in specific local settings and contexts.

59
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:19,473
Chapter three will help you to prioritize and formulate

60
00:03:19,673 --> 00:03:23,792
research questions focused around appropriate interventions

61
00:03:23,992 --> 00:03:26,522
given the context in which you're working.

62
00:03:26,722 --> 00:03:29,722
And chapter four provides some concrete examples

63
00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:32,660
of implementation research needs assessments

64
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:35,860
through different settings and contexts.

65
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:40,459
Uche and Bill leave you with some assessment exercises

66
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:43,659
that will get you thinking critically

67
00:03:43,859 --> 00:03:46,222
about factoring the diversity of settings

68
00:03:46,422 --> 00:03:49,422
into the way you conceptualize and design

69
00:03:49,622 --> 00:03:51,700
your implementation research.

70
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,067
Best of luck, and enjoy the module.
