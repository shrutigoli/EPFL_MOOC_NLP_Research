000:00:05,325 --> 00:00:10,225In this chapter we will share a few implementation research100:00:10,424 --> 00:00:15,537case studies and will try to stress the importance of200:00:15,799 --> 00:00:18,487needs assessment in designing control300:00:18,687 --> 00:00:22,224and elimination programs in different settings.400:00:22,424 --> 00:00:25,725Different settings have different challenges. As we500:00:25,987 --> 00:00:31,049mentioned in the previous chapter these settings include: community600:00:31,974 --> 00:00:38,050health facility, work site, and schools in urban and rural areas.700:00:38,250 --> 00:00:42,242These are different geographical settings across the country.800:00:42,442 --> 00:00:47,129Data and evidence from these sources should inform implementation900:00:47,329 --> 00:00:51,917research potentials. Gathering evidence from published and1000:00:52,117 --> 00:00:57,985unpublished reports, surveys and other sources gives a better1100:00:58,185 --> 00:01:04,685understanding of programme needs in that setting. Here are some case studies.1200:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,246Our first example comes from adapting community directed1300:01:10,446 --> 00:01:15,392treatment with ivermectin to addressing other health interventions.1400:01:16,692 --> 00:01:22,501As a first step, we had to bring together a multi-disciplinary team:1500:01:22,701 --> 00:01:28,572programme managers, public health experts, social scientists, and1600:01:28,797 --> 00:01:33,852epidemiologists. We gathered base line information to understand1700:01:34,052 --> 00:01:38,627the challenges. Not only to continue ivermectin distribution,1800:01:38,827 --> 00:01:45,037but also to improve the delivery services for malaria, tuberculosis1900:01:45,237 --> 00:01:51,625and Vitamin A. In order to design appropriate intervention, we needed2000:01:51,825 --> 00:01:56,549also to understand the systems at different operational levels.2100:01:57,237 --> 00:02:02,629By the understanding, we designed our standard intervention steps,2200:02:02,829 --> 00:02:09,048as you can see in the slide. Because we did needs assessment2300:02:09,248 --> 00:02:14,393at the beginning we were able to document the progress we made2400:02:14,593 --> 00:02:22,674and able to compare it with the baseline. Basically, you can see2500:02:22,874 --> 00:02:28,574some of the achievements on the slide. We had programme improvements2600:02:28,774 --> 00:02:34,561not only in the delivery of services and in improving access2700:02:34,798 --> 00:02:39,780to the services, but also the functioning of the health systems.2800:02:40,305 --> 00:02:44,965As you can see in the slide, the effect of community directed2900:02:45,165 --> 00:02:51,033intervention delivery was especially dramatic for malaria interventions.3000:02:52,183 --> 00:02:58,866One, coverage with insecticide-treated bed nets and the percentage of3100:02:59,066 --> 00:03:03,686children appropriately treated for malaria more than doubled.3200:03:05,074 --> 00:03:09,449Annual ivermectin treatment coverage also improved,3300:03:09,649 --> 00:03:14,395possibly because of greater community commitment to the total3400:03:14,595 --> 00:03:23,778CDI package. In terms of costs to the health system, the CD strategy3500:03:23,978 --> 00:03:29,972also appeared more efficient than the conventional delivery systems.3600:03:31,209 --> 00:03:36,900Because the study we just described was built on the foundation of3700:03:37,100 --> 00:03:42,821of CD ivermectin treatment approach the question remained:3800:03:43,021 --> 00:03:46,877could this Community Directed Approach work in settings3900:03:47,077 --> 00:03:50,464that didn’t have ivermectin distribution programme?4000:03:50,664 --> 00:03:56,868Formative studies or needs assessment studies were done to find out whether4100:03:57,068 --> 00:04:03,659Whether the approach could work in groups such as: the nomads, urban poor,4200:04:03,859 --> 00:04:11,208rural areas with no community directed treatment with ivermectin experience.4300:04:11,408 --> 00:04:18,534These results can encourage future IR. I would like to refer you4400:04:18,734 --> 00:04:24,315to the article and hope you will read it. Bill will now continue4500:04:24,515 --> 00:04:28,381with examples from the malaria programme. Thank you.4600:04:28,994 --> 00:04:32,829Thank you, Uche. These have been very interesting examples4700:04:33,029 --> 00:04:40,102because this has been an ongoing programme, this onchocerciasis program since at least 20 years4800:04:40,302 --> 00:04:43,365and we’ve been reaping the benefits not just for ochocerciasis4900:04:43,565 --> 00:04:49,784but for IR for other health programmes. We’re gonna talk about a few malaria5000:04:49,984 --> 00:04:54,350examples right now. One of the biggest challenges we have in malaria5100:04:54,550 --> 00:04:59,244is getting people the right medicine at the right time.5200:04:59,444 --> 00:05:05,353And we’ve seen through our Global Fund reports, we’ve seen5300:05:05,553 --> 00:05:10,032through our demographic and health or malaria indicator surveys that we5400:05:10,232 --> 00:05:13,877have not done the best that we could in terms of making sure that5500:05:14,114 --> 00:05:19,206sick people get the appropriate malaria drug as soon as they need it.5600:05:19,406 --> 00:05:25,627And this may be due to the channel through which it’s provided5700:05:25,827 --> 00:05:29,801and we need to think of interventions that can increase access5800:05:30,001 --> 00:05:34,192(you’ll think back to module 1, access was one of the big issues5900:05:34,392 --> 00:05:39,545that we talked about). So, we found that with normal public6000:05:39,745 --> 00:05:45,391service based malaria programmes we’ve been able to possibly reach6100:05:45,591 --> 00:05:50,563about half of people with the appropriate medicine. And so, again6200:05:50,763 --> 00:05:54,720we’ve done needs assessments looking on our Global Fund reports,6300:05:54,920 --> 00:05:59,033looking at our health information system reports, looking at reports6400:05:59,233 --> 00:06:04,521from the demographic and health surveys and we see that this is not6500:06:04,721 --> 00:06:08,320enough. So, we would then gather some additional information from6600:06:08,520 --> 00:06:12,490interviewing people and we would try to think of some creative ways6700:06:12,690 --> 00:06:18,172of delivering malaria drugs in an appropriate way. And one of the6800:06:18,372 --> 00:06:22,618interventions that’s been tried in a number of countries, particularly6900:06:22,818 --> 00:06:26,886through a special programe called the Affordable Medicines Facility7000:06:27,086 --> 00:06:32,149for Malaria is making low cost appropriate malaria medications7100:06:32,349 --> 00:06:35,613available to both the public, but especially the private sector.7200:06:35,813 --> 00:06:39,314And this is one of the things that studies have shown is that7300:06:39,652 --> 00:06:43,654many people get their malaria drugs in the private sector. So, we7400:06:43,854 --> 00:06:48,431would use the information we have to design the intervention that would7500:06:48,631 --> 00:06:55,283train, supervise, and ensure the correct stock for the private sector.7600:06:55,544 --> 00:06:59,361Particularly, the private informal sector, they’re  called medicine sellers,7700:06:59,549 --> 00:07:02,473medicine shops, patent medicine sellers, chemical sellers.7800:07:02,673 --> 00:07:06,035They have all different names. They're not available in all countries,7900:07:06,235 --> 00:07:09,178it depends on the legal framework, but where they exist8000:07:09,378 --> 00:07:12,917they meet a lot of the need. So, we need to use our information8100:07:13,117 --> 00:07:18,406to design interventions for that group. We’ve talked about the issue8200:07:18,606 --> 00:07:22,787of Intermittent Preventive Treatment (IPT) for pregnant women and the fact8300:07:22,987 --> 00:07:29,988that new WHO guidance encourages women to get more than 2 doses of8400:07:30,188 --> 00:07:35,288of IPT, now hopefully they can get at least 3, maybe 4 at every8500:07:35,488 --> 00:07:40,071antenatal visit. But what we’ve seen is that in the process of8600:07:40,271 --> 00:07:48,985increasing to  doses or more, that we are not getting better coverage.8700:07:49,185 --> 00:07:53,829There’s a drop-off. Which is normal in many ways, but again8800:07:54,029 --> 00:08:00,067we need to use our needs assessment to find out is this drop off because8900:08:00,267 --> 00:08:02,855of problems of stock out. So, we would look at our9000:08:03,055 --> 00:08:07,095logistic management information system data to see if we are getting9100:08:07,295 --> 00:08:11,572stocks to the local clinics. Is it a question of people not attending9200:08:11,772 --> 00:08:17,460antenatal care enough times to benefit from the additional doses?9300:08:17,660 --> 00:08:21,045What we can do? If we observe9400:08:21,245 --> 00:08:26,054we may find that nurses are forgetting to give it, they're9500:08:26,246 --> 00:08:28,634forgetting to inquire if the women have it, they're forgetting9600:08:28,834 --> 00:08:32,168to look at the records to see if the woman has had previous doses,9700:08:32,368 --> 00:08:36,026or they may be giving the doses and forgetting to record it.9800:08:36,226 --> 00:08:42,550So, one intervention that might be tried would be a mobile health,9900:08:42,750 --> 00:08:47,333mHealth type of programme where reminders can be sent on a regular10000:08:47,533 --> 00:08:53,525basis to frontline clinic staff to encourage them to give IPT10100:08:53,725 --> 00:08:56,391as many times as possible and record this.10200:08:56,591 --> 00:08:59,889But again, we would need to do the needs assessment to find out10300:09:00,089 --> 00:09:03,932what the problem is and assuming that we find out by observing,10400:09:04,132 --> 00:09:08,027doing supervisory checklists that the problem is with the health workers,10500:09:08,227 --> 00:09:13,192not carrying out the IPT tasks to the fullest; then we can try10600:09:13,392 --> 00:09:16,392to design interventions based on the information we get from our10700:09:16,592 --> 00:09:21,511needs assessment. In many countries community health workers are simply10800:09:21,711 --> 00:09:26,536there to do health promotion health education. Provide information on10900:09:26,736 --> 00:09:31,545sanitation, on hygiene, maybe encourage people to go to the clinic11000:09:31,745 --> 00:09:37,490and get services, get treatment, encourage people to use bed-nets11100:09:37,690 --> 00:09:41,626if they receive them, encourage pregnant women to go to antenatal care,11200:09:41,826 --> 00:09:46,702but in our work with malaria in particular we’ve seen that11300:09:46,902 --> 00:09:53,291again this is a missed opportunity. That, in order to increase coverage11400:09:53,491 --> 00:09:57,374it would be very helpful if community health workers could11500:09:57,574 --> 00:10:04,027provide basic treatment for malaria and as we said other common illnesses11600:10:04,227 --> 00:10:10,059in the community. So, we do need to gather information, use our11700:10:10,259 --> 00:10:15,081reports to determine that there are people being missed.11800:10:15,281 --> 00:10:19,594We need to do further review of laws and legal framework,11900:10:19,794 --> 00:10:24,351to see what about the possibility of community members handling12000:10:24,551 --> 00:10:29,997simple medications. We need to look at the ability of communities12100:10:30,197 --> 00:10:35,394to support volunteers. We need to look at the ability of health center staff12200:10:35,594 --> 00:10:41,498to train and supervise. So, we need to look into,  do a needs assessment12300:10:41,698 --> 00:10:46,779on the feasibility of this. We also can learn from other countries.12400:10:46,979 --> 00:10:51,934If a country has not introduced village health workers doing12500:10:52,134 --> 00:10:55,259community case management, they can look at places like Rwanda12600:10:55,459 --> 00:10:58,459that has well-established community health worker system12700:10:58,659 --> 00:11:03,886where they do not only test for malaria, but also provide treatment12800:11:04,086 --> 00:11:07,781for malaria and other childhood illnesses. So, again we can gather12900:11:07,981 --> 00:11:11,177needs assessment info in the country and look at other programmes13000:11:11,377 --> 00:11:15,433to learn from them. Again, related to this issue of community health13100:11:15,633 --> 00:11:19,166workers,we don’t want to have a double standard,13200:11:19,366 --> 00:11:23,989where you have what we call presumptive treatment of malaria.13300:11:24,189 --> 00:11:29,465Based on signs and symptoms in one area which would be community health13400:11:29,665 --> 00:11:33,567workers or even medicine shops, and then at the clinic have13500:11:33,767 --> 00:11:37,520a different standard where we’re using parasitological tests like13600:11:37,720 --> 00:11:43,391microscopy, like RDTs - rapid diagnostic tests, and then basing13700:11:43,591 --> 00:11:49,319treatment on that. So, we have seen pilot interventions in some countries13800:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,403where the community health workers have been taught successfully13900:11:53,603 --> 00:11:59,930to use RDTs safely and accurately. So, the question is if we want to14000:12:00,130 --> 00:12:05,142introduce that into our country we need to examine other programmes,14100:12:05,342 --> 00:12:09,338we need to collect information on treatment seeking, we need to14200:12:09,538 --> 00:12:14,565provide information from supervising village health workers to see what14300:12:14,765 --> 00:12:18,977they’re capable of. So, again, we need to do a needs assessment14400:12:19,177 --> 00:12:24,658prior to developing any of these interventions, so that we base it on14500:12:24,858 --> 00:12:28,245the local context, the local reality and the local needs.14600:12:28,445 --> 00:12:31,099We have a few take home messages.14700:12:31,299 --> 00:12:38,953Basically, we have tried to examine how the development14800:12:39,153 --> 00:12:44,330of implementation research comes out of an assessment of needs,14900:12:44,530 --> 00:12:49,673a baseline assessment, situation analysis of what is happening15000:12:49,873 --> 00:12:55,725on the ground. Not only are people having access to and receiving15100:12:55,925 --> 00:12:59,954the services, but also from the process point of view are these15200:13:00,154 --> 00:13:03,896services being delivered in the most effective and efficient manner.15300:13:04,096 --> 00:13:09,542We want to make sure that we not only have a plan to reach people15400:13:09,742 --> 00:13:12,742and increase our targets, but that we look at the local system:15500:13:12,942 --> 00:13:16,230the inside, the outside, the local context.15600:13:16,430 --> 00:13:19,970Whether we’re talking about the context of schools, or clinics,15700:13:20,170 --> 00:13:24,151or work sites or communities, but the context of different geographical15800:13:24,351 --> 00:13:27,663areas, different epidemiological areas in our country for the15900:13:27,863 --> 00:13:32,869different diseases and adapt our programmes to the information that16000:13:33,069 --> 00:13:37,475we find about those particular areas. We stress that there’re16100:13:37,675 --> 00:13:42,167many sources of information that you can use to do your16200:13:42,367 --> 00:13:44,759needs assessment or situation analysis.16300:13:44,959 --> 00:13:49,102Obviously, there’s wide variety of documents and reports on16400:13:49,302 --> 00:13:53,561existing programmes. Some of these are from national or international16500:13:53,761 --> 00:13:57,922agencies that have provided financial support. Some of these16600:13:58,122 --> 00:14:02,452are internal programme reports. But we again want to look at reports16700:14:02,652 --> 00:14:06,476and documents. We want to talk to the people.16800:14:06,676 --> 00:14:10,821Those, who benefit from the programmes, or potentially could16900:14:11,021 --> 00:14:14,261benefit, but may not be. We want to talk about the people directly17000:14:14,461 --> 00:14:18,995involved in service delivery, service management, to get all of their views17100:14:19,195 --> 00:14:22,195about what works, what doesn’t work and why.17200:14:22,395 --> 00:14:27,584And then thirdly, we want to observe what is happening at the17300:14:27,784 --> 00:14:31,721service delivery point, what is happening in the community that may17400:14:31,921 --> 00:14:36,308influence the acceptance of a programme or access to a programme.17500:14:36,508 --> 00:14:39,508What is happening in schools and work sites.17600:14:39,708 --> 00:14:42,708We need to have a structured way.17700:14:42,908 --> 00:14:46,247We’ve talked about checklists, for example. To learn what’s going on17800:14:46,447 --> 00:14:48,717in that context, in that environment.17900:14:48,917 --> 00:14:52,966And use that information for needs assessment to design18000:14:53,166 --> 00:14:58,655good operations research. In conclusion, of course, we want18100:14:58,855 --> 00:15:05,694good research questions that derive directly from available information18200:15:05,894 --> 00:15:09,179that we’ve pulled together from existing reports or that we18300:15:09,379 --> 00:15:13,004have gone out and collected through surveys and observation.18400:15:13,204 --> 00:15:17,667So that our proposed intervention that we are going to study18500:15:17,867 --> 00:15:23,955is based and grounded in the needs of those communities and settings.18600:15:24,155 --> 00:15:32,370Before we go, just a little note about a couple of the resources18700:15:32,570 --> 00:15:37,193that you can get online to help you plan implementation research18800:15:37,393 --> 00:15:42,862and of course these have sections about the needs assessment process,18900:15:43,062 --> 00:15:48,502the situation analysis process. We have both of these available on19000:15:48,702 --> 00:15:50,933who.int/tdr website.19100:15:51,133 --> 00:15:56,968One of course, is a toolkit that can be the basis for a training programme,19200:15:57,168 --> 00:15:59,644and the other is a framework for planning.19300:15:59,844 --> 00:16:03,320So, we hope you can access these materials for your use19400:16:03,520 --> 00:16:08,001throughout this course. Thank you again for joining us19500:16:08,201 --> 00:16:10,792in module two, Uche  and I wish you well19600:16:10,992 --> 00:16:14,597in the rest of the course. Enjoy module 3. Thank you.
