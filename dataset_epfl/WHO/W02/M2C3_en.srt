000:00:04,964 --> 00:00:07,414Hello and welcome to our third chapter100:00:07,614 --> 00:00:08,573in module 2.200:00:08,773 --> 00:00:10,290In our previous chapter300:00:10,490 --> 00:00:13,178we looked at different ways of gathering information400:00:13,378 --> 00:00:15,221about our programmes.500:00:15,421 --> 00:00:18,298About the context in which they are operating in.600:00:18,498 --> 00:00:20,895About how people are accessing and using them700:00:21,049 --> 00:00:22,992so that we could take this information800:00:23,192 --> 00:00:25,838and carry out the next step, which we'll discuss here,900:00:26,038 --> 00:00:29,598in terms of how do you formulate a question.1000:00:29,798 --> 00:00:31,795Basically the questions are:1100:00:31,995 --> 00:00:33,602"What needs to be changed?"1200:00:33,802 --> 00:00:36,746and "What kind of intervention can achieve that?"1300:00:36,946 --> 00:00:39,159So we'll look at some of the potential1400:00:39,359 --> 00:00:41,381implementation research questions1500:00:41,581 --> 00:00:43,633that a group might address.1600:00:43,833 --> 00:00:46,814We see here that there are 2 kinds of questions1700:00:47,014 --> 00:00:48,951that you can address1800:00:49,151 --> 00:00:51,176in implementation research.1900:00:51,376 --> 00:00:54,144And again we're trying to get this information2000:00:54,344 --> 00:00:56,331both in the clinic, in the community,2100:00:56,531 --> 00:00:58,922in schools, in work sites.2200:00:59,122 --> 00:01:00,455You can see here,2300:01:00,655 --> 00:01:02,557we have a supervisory staff2400:01:02,670 --> 00:01:04,879going out to visit the village health worker,2500:01:04,979 --> 00:01:06,518looking at the register she has,2600:01:06,593 --> 00:01:08,806so they've gathered information directly2700:01:09,006 --> 00:01:11,401from the person who is providing2800:01:11,601 --> 00:01:13,483community case management.2900:01:13,683 --> 00:01:16,449So we want to take the information we've collected3000:01:16,649 --> 00:01:20,720by looking at 2 issues.3100:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,159One,3200:01:22,359 --> 00:01:24,775What are the key programme challenges3300:01:24,975 --> 00:01:25,983that we found?3400:01:26,183 --> 00:01:28,909What are the gaps? What needs to be addressed?3500:01:29,109 --> 00:01:32,859What are we doing not as well as we could?3600:01:33,059 --> 00:01:36,083What new ideas do we have for intervention?3700:01:36,283 --> 00:01:37,877And then the second,3800:01:38,077 --> 00:01:40,178what are the possible interventions?3900:01:40,671 --> 00:01:41,994If, for example,4000:01:42,194 --> 00:01:44,016the community health workers4100:01:44,128 --> 00:01:46,258are having difficulty keeping records4200:01:46,458 --> 00:01:48,480can we do an intervention4300:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,624that looks at a different kind of record-keeping format?4400:01:52,824 --> 00:01:55,653We tried something like this some years ago4500:01:55,853 --> 00:01:58,932for keeping record of the number of people4600:01:59,006 --> 00:02:01,009who received the ivermectin treatments.4700:02:01,097 --> 00:02:02,576And we tried 3 different things.4800:02:02,676 --> 00:02:04,136We tried a tally sheet,4900:02:04,336 --> 00:02:06,545because some of our village health workers5000:02:06,745 --> 00:02:07,938were not well-educated.5100:02:08,138 --> 00:02:09,119Tally sheet.5200:02:09,319 --> 00:02:10,898We tried a 5300:02:11,098 --> 00:02:14,380process of putting little stones in different colored bags.5400:02:14,705 --> 00:02:18,539And then we used the existing record form5500:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,211that had come from the programme.5600:02:20,411 --> 00:02:21,738So these are some examples5700:02:21,938 --> 00:02:23,826of how you use your information5800:02:23,926 --> 00:02:25,192to raise a question:5900:02:25,392 --> 00:02:28,624What would be the best intervention6000:02:28,711 --> 00:02:31,614to improve the quality of record keeping6100:02:31,727 --> 00:02:33,993by our community volunteers?6200:02:34,155 --> 00:02:36,837We had talked earlier about programmes6300:02:37,037 --> 00:02:38,921moving through different stages.6400:02:39,121 --> 00:02:41,765We talked about the malaria programme6500:02:41,965 --> 00:02:43,543where we talked about scaling up,6600:02:43,743 --> 00:02:46,938sustaining, trying to get to pre-elimination.6700:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,823And so,6800:02:49,023 --> 00:02:52,082one of the problems that we've come across6900:02:52,282 --> 00:02:53,912as we've talked about before7000:02:54,112 --> 00:02:57,974is it is difficult to sustain the coverage,7100:02:58,174 --> 00:03:01,400the proportion of people sleeping under these bed nets.7200:03:02,388 --> 00:03:05,964The nets were supposed to be long lasting7300:03:05,964 --> 00:03:07,960Actually, they're good for about 3 years7400:03:09,235 --> 00:03:10,123or 2 years.7500:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,120The question is,7600:03:13,824 --> 00:03:18,158how do we ensure that after those 2 years7700:03:18,358 --> 00:03:19,369people get nets?7800:03:19,469 --> 00:03:21,860But even more importantly, how do they use them?7900:03:22,723 --> 00:03:25,401You've seen some examples in the previous chapter8000:03:25,601 --> 00:03:29,256of creative utilizations of the bed nets.8100:03:29,456 --> 00:03:31,918And we want to make sure that first and foremost8200:03:32,118 --> 00:03:33,607people are taken care of8300:03:33,807 --> 00:03:37,538before fish and goats and plants are taken care of.8400:03:37,738 --> 00:03:40,271So in terms of of using the nets,8500:03:40,471 --> 00:03:43,506an important IR question could be8600:03:43,706 --> 00:03:46,176"Is there a better way to do health education,8700:03:46,376 --> 00:03:47,627health communication,8800:03:47,827 --> 00:03:50,012social behavioural change communication,8900:03:50,212 --> 00:03:54,072that will ensure that people are using their nets?"9000:03:57,125 --> 00:04:00,053One of the things we discovered after a mass distribution in one of our countries,9100:04:00,253 --> 00:04:01,747is that there was no follow up.9200:04:01,947 --> 00:04:04,271They had trained village volunteers9300:04:04,371 --> 00:04:06,559to go out and calculate the number of people9400:04:06,634 --> 00:04:07,735living in the village9500:04:07,935 --> 00:04:10,010and giving them vouchers,9600:04:10,110 --> 00:04:12,015but they didn't train them to follow up9700:04:12,077 --> 00:04:13,254to make sure people knew9800:04:13,304 --> 00:04:15,496how to hang the net in their particular house,9900:04:15,583 --> 00:04:17,669the importance of sleeping under the net10000:04:17,869 --> 00:04:20,071So possibly, an IR question is,10100:04:20,271 --> 00:04:23,555"How can we develop a communication approach10200:04:23,755 --> 00:04:27,684that will increase the likelihood of people sleeping under nets?"10300:04:27,884 --> 00:04:29,557So again, using our findings10400:04:29,757 --> 00:04:31,632and trying to develop questions10500:04:31,832 --> 00:04:34,832for better interventions that can be tested.10600:04:35,769 --> 00:04:40,408We've discovered with another infectious disease of10700:04:40,608 --> 00:04:43,310poverty, lymphatic filariasis10800:04:43,510 --> 00:04:44,619that we do have stages.10900:04:44,819 --> 00:04:52,588There are approximately 7 to 10 years of intervention11000:04:52,707 --> 00:04:58,125for mass drug administration11100:04:58,325 --> 00:05:01,635to control the disease.11200:05:01,835 --> 00:05:05,116But again, you don't want to stop control completely11300:05:05,256 --> 00:05:09,263until you know that you have really brought down11400:05:09,463 --> 00:05:10,984the incidence of the disease.11500:05:11,184 --> 00:05:14,989Then you need to do a various kinds of assessments.11600:05:15,189 --> 00:05:17,270Now these surveys,11700:05:17,470 --> 00:05:19,133these assessments are not cheap.11800:05:19,333 --> 00:05:22,425So you don't want to do it prematurely.11900:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,611So some researchers12000:05:24,811 --> 00:05:27,810have said, Okay. Can we come up with new ways12100:05:28,010 --> 00:05:31,010of getting information on compliance,12200:05:31,210 --> 00:05:34,370you know, with the drugs,12300:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,570with the ivermectin and albendazole12400:05:37,770 --> 00:05:39,263in Africa?12500:05:39,463 --> 00:05:42,224Can we find out if people are actually taking these drugs?12600:05:42,424 --> 00:05:45,014And are enough people taking it12700:05:45,214 --> 00:05:47,757to bring down the incidence of the disease12800:05:47,957 --> 00:05:51,599before we actually do a mass survey?12900:05:51,799 --> 00:05:55,462So what kind of ways of finding out13000:05:55,662 --> 00:05:57,237from the health workers,13100:05:57,437 --> 00:05:58,784from the communities,13200:05:58,984 --> 00:06:00,243you know, can we use?13300:06:00,343 --> 00:06:01,879Can we design an intervention13400:06:02,079 --> 00:06:05,410that will have real-time information collection13500:06:05,610 --> 00:06:08,138to help us inform our programme13600:06:08,338 --> 00:06:10,162when to stop.13700:06:10,362 --> 00:06:13,010So this is another example of a question13800:06:13,210 --> 00:06:15,643of, you know, how are we doing?13900:06:15,843 --> 00:06:17,094and in intervention,14000:06:17,294 --> 00:06:21,019"Can we collect information in real-time better?"14100:06:21,219 --> 00:06:23,100There are a number of questions here14200:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,229that we can think about very briefly.14300:06:25,429 --> 00:06:27,385Some of you may have experienced these.14400:06:27,497 --> 00:06:31,119Hopefully these ideas will make you think of some of the challenges14500:06:31,319 --> 00:06:33,148that occur in your own environment.14600:06:33,348 --> 00:06:36,946We have a challenge that we've seen14700:06:37,146 --> 00:06:39,952with malaria intervention coverage being low.14800:06:40,164 --> 00:06:42,532One option14900:06:42,732 --> 00:06:46,576is looking at community distribution:15000:06:46,776 --> 00:06:51,074community volunteers providing intermittent preventive treatment15100:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,136for pregnant women.15200:06:52,287 --> 00:06:54,971There have been pros and cons discussed15300:06:55,171 --> 00:07:00,525but we will not know if this is a reasonable and safe intervention until we pilot test it.15400:07:02,335 --> 00:07:03,758So we need to raise questions15500:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,956about is there a community component15600:07:07,156 --> 00:07:10,029to the antenatal care delivery.15700:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,550Can we have a community clinic partnership15800:07:12,750 --> 00:07:18,764to improve the delivery of this IPT?15900:07:18,964 --> 00:07:20,795One of the biggest challenges16000:07:20,995 --> 00:07:23,570that all health services face,16100:07:23,770 --> 00:07:26,577again you saw this in the last module, is stock-out.16200:07:26,777 --> 00:07:28,267And sometimes16300:07:28,467 --> 00:07:31,692clinics don't receive enough stock for themselves,16400:07:31,892 --> 00:07:34,875let alone to distribute to community health workers16500:07:35,075 --> 00:07:37,057for community-case management.16600:07:37,457 --> 00:07:39,464So the question is,16700:07:39,664 --> 00:07:42,826Is there a better way, more effective way,16800:07:43,026 --> 00:07:45,842an intervention that could improve16900:07:46,042 --> 00:07:49,506the availability of these drugs and other commodities17000:07:49,706 --> 00:07:52,396to address community case management?17100:07:52,896 --> 00:07:56,319Is there a role for private sector?17200:07:56,519 --> 00:07:59,455Is there a role for revolving funds?17300:07:59,655 --> 00:08:00,567What could be done?17400:08:00,692 --> 00:08:04,407So we need to raise these kinds of intervention ideas17500:08:04,607 --> 00:08:07,905as questions for implementation research.17600:08:08,392 --> 00:08:10,921Again, we find in some cases,17700:08:11,121 --> 00:08:14,449that community health workers17800:08:14,649 --> 00:08:19,753have been taught to recognize malaria by signs and symptoms.17900:08:19,953 --> 00:08:25,099But we know that not all cases of fever are malaria.18000:08:25,186 --> 00:08:26,488And we know18100:08:26,551 --> 00:08:28,353that many people enjoy the service18200:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,140of the community health worker18300:08:30,215 --> 00:08:32,484since it improves access, it's very convenient.18400:08:32,824 --> 00:08:34,225So the question is,18500:08:34,425 --> 00:08:37,180Can we train, and can they effectively do18600:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,491rapid diagnostic tests for malaria18700:08:40,691 --> 00:08:42,593at the village level?18800:08:42,793 --> 00:08:46,466Okay. So an intervention to test this out would be in order.18900:08:46,666 --> 00:08:51,131So again our goal is to increase our coverage of appropriate care.19000:08:51,681 --> 00:08:55,749Let's say that we, again, we've been looking at ivermectin.19100:08:55,949 --> 00:08:59,878This is a programme that started with mass distribution19200:09:00,078 --> 00:09:04,035through community effort in 1995,19300:09:04,235 --> 00:09:06,573the founding of the African Programme,19400:09:06,773 --> 00:09:08,248for Onchocerciasis Control,19500:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,906and it's been estimated that if coverage can be maintained,19600:09:13,091 --> 00:09:16,491at least 65% of eligible people19700:09:16,691 --> 00:09:21,183up till...for at least 20-some years,19800:09:21,383 --> 00:09:24,368that we might be able to eliminate transmission19900:09:24,568 --> 00:09:25,889of the disease.20000:09:26,469 --> 00:09:27,834There are a lot of ifs there20100:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,503but this is a question.20200:09:29,703 --> 00:09:34,241But sometimes, and hopefully by the early 2020s,20300:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,754we might achieve that goal.20400:09:35,954 --> 00:09:39,116But, if people have been taking this drug every year,20500:09:39,316 --> 00:09:42,316and for some reason the coverage drops,20600:09:42,516 --> 00:09:43,990less people take it.20700:09:44,190 --> 00:09:46,679You know, is it because they're tired of taking it?20800:09:46,879 --> 00:09:48,618Is it because of supplies?20900:09:48,818 --> 00:09:50,402What are the reasons?21000:09:50,602 --> 00:09:51,563But we need to think,21100:09:51,563 --> 00:09:53,560Okay, we've been working with our communities21200:09:54,081 --> 00:09:55,510to distribute this drug,21300:09:55,710 --> 00:09:58,289is there any way we can tweak or improve21400:09:58,489 --> 00:10:01,561on that community distribution to make it better?21500:10:01,624 --> 00:10:03,208So that would be another example21600:10:03,283 --> 00:10:05,375of an implementation research question.21700:10:06,212 --> 00:10:09,514We had some data, that we talked about before,21800:10:09,714 --> 00:10:12,037from our health information system,21900:10:12,237 --> 00:10:17,569and we show that while we've increased over the years22000:10:17,769 --> 00:10:20,411the number of women who got their second dose22100:10:20,611 --> 00:10:22,791of IPT,22200:10:22,991 --> 00:10:24,940what has happened is that22300:10:25,140 --> 00:10:27,792now that we've introduced 3 or more doses22400:10:27,992 --> 00:10:33,967we have the challenge of living up to that new target.22500:10:34,466 --> 00:10:37,111And although these data show22600:10:37,311 --> 00:10:38,969that in, I think it was Burkina Faso,22700:10:39,169 --> 00:10:42,965that, yes, that once IPT3 was introduced22800:10:43,165 --> 00:10:47,307it has been taken up by more women.22900:10:47,507 --> 00:10:50,696But we also recognize23000:10:50,796 --> 00:10:55,908that it is nowhere near these targets of 80% or more.23100:10:56,108 --> 00:10:58,059So what can we do?23200:10:58,259 --> 00:11:03,465First, are there interventions at the clinic that can be done?23300:11:03,665 --> 00:11:06,163Is there a special training that nurses could have23400:11:06,363 --> 00:11:12,330to help them recognize and record the need for treatment23500:11:12,530 --> 00:11:14,375of the third dose?23600:11:14,575 --> 00:11:18,376Is there anything they could do to improve their interviewing skills23700:11:18,576 --> 00:11:20,789to identify women who need a third dose?23800:11:20,789 --> 00:11:22,780Is there anything they could do to encourage women to come back23900:11:24,497 --> 00:11:26,407for antenatal care, you know,24000:11:26,607 --> 00:11:30,129for the requisite number of times so that they get their full dose?24100:11:30,329 --> 00:11:32,263And as we mentioned before,24200:11:32,463 --> 00:11:34,660is there a role for the community?24300:11:34,860 --> 00:11:35,826In some places,24400:11:35,939 --> 00:11:38,324a community intervention has been designed24500:11:38,524 --> 00:11:42,689where the community mobilizes and educates mothers24600:11:42,889 --> 00:11:46,647and others, testing out whether the community can help deliver24700:11:46,847 --> 00:11:48,197these additional doses.24800:11:48,397 --> 00:11:50,442So again our information24900:11:50,642 --> 00:11:52,554raises the question25000:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,934that we can think about together as we said earlier,25100:11:56,134 --> 00:12:00,399with all of our stakeholders come up with a locally relevant design,25200:12:00,599 --> 00:12:02,609locally relevant intervention25300:12:02,696 --> 00:12:05,282that can be tested through implementation research.25400:12:05,382 --> 00:12:08,616We talked about our various surveys.25500:12:08,816 --> 00:12:11,931Our demographic and health surveys.25600:12:12,131 --> 00:12:15,050Our malaria indicator surveys.25700:12:15,250 --> 00:12:18,785And we want to use that information25800:12:18,985 --> 00:12:23,568to guide us to think about improving programmes,25900:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,815designing new interventions.26000:12:26,223 --> 00:12:30,758So we can see that from this survey26100:12:30,958 --> 00:12:37,877that there was increase in the number of children26200:12:38,077 --> 00:12:40,758who had been tested, had a blood test,26300:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,942whether it was RDT or microscopy,26400:12:44,142 --> 00:12:47,860but who had a test, so that number has been slowly increasing.26500:12:49,273 --> 00:12:50,841Now the question is,26600:12:51,041 --> 00:12:54,340the goal is not just testing anybody who has malaria26700:12:54,540 --> 00:12:56,921because we don't know until we test.26800:12:57,121 --> 00:13:01,098Our goal is to test anyone with a fever26900:13:01,298 --> 00:13:03,780and then promptly treat them.27000:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,223So what we're seeing is that27100:13:07,423 --> 00:13:09,602we have a long way to go.27200:13:09,802 --> 00:13:13,440And it means if we're providing treatment for these children,27300:13:13,640 --> 00:13:15,933if we've only tested less than half of them,27400:13:16,133 --> 00:13:19,853we may be giving inappropriate treatment to the other half.27500:13:20,489 --> 00:13:22,136So the question is,27600:13:22,336 --> 00:13:24,297why that being done?27700:13:24,497 --> 00:13:29,441Now earlier we mentioned that testing may not be done in the community,27800:13:29,641 --> 00:13:31,487And we may want  an intervention27900:13:31,587 --> 00:13:34,586where village health workers or community health workers28000:13:34,786 --> 00:13:38,710can be encouraged to use, trained to use these tests,28100:13:38,785 --> 00:13:40,607and we can if that intervention works.28200:13:40,732 --> 00:13:42,322But it also happens in the clinic.28300:13:42,517 --> 00:13:45,454We found in places where the attitudes of the health workers28400:13:45,654 --> 00:13:46,370were a bit poor.28500:13:46,570 --> 00:13:49,206They trust in their judgment better than the test.28600:13:49,406 --> 00:13:51,771The tests are actually quite accurate28700:13:51,971 --> 00:13:54,547or else money wouldn't be spent on buying them.28800:13:54,635 --> 00:13:56,572But what we still want to think about is,28900:13:56,772 --> 00:14:00,246how do we increase the confidence of the health workers?29000:14:00,358 --> 00:14:02,185What kind of intervention can be done29100:14:02,385 --> 00:14:03,950in terms not just training29200:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,486but  supervision, reinforcement, mentorship.29300:14:06,686 --> 00:14:11,566So we need to design interventions that can increase the use of testing29400:14:11,766 --> 00:14:14,141in the clinics and in the communities.29500:14:14,341 --> 00:14:17,072You saw this information earlier,29600:14:17,272 --> 00:14:19,640about supervisory checklists29700:14:19,832 --> 00:14:22,081for the community health workers29800:14:22,281 --> 00:14:24,280doing community case management29900:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,483of childhood illness,30000:14:25,683 --> 00:14:28,295and as we said at that point in time,30100:14:28,495 --> 00:14:33,936we had major challenges in the area of history taking and examination.30200:14:34,136 --> 00:14:35,730Although things were improving,30300:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,347this area was the weakest area.30400:14:38,547 --> 00:14:40,237So the question there again is,30500:14:40,437 --> 00:14:43,993can we do something to improve supervision?30600:14:44,193 --> 00:14:45,552What can we do?30700:14:45,752 --> 00:14:49,814We've seen community health worker programmes in other countries,30800:14:50,014 --> 00:14:55,461that recognize that health staff may not have adequate transportation.30900:14:55,661 --> 00:14:58,358But in a smaller geographical area,31000:14:58,558 --> 00:15:01,459one of the more experienced community health workers31100:15:01,659 --> 00:15:03,828could serve as a peer supervisor,31200:15:04,028 --> 00:15:07,627and be able to move around more easily in the villages to reinforce.31300:15:07,827 --> 00:15:10,659So an intervention that we could test31400:15:10,859 --> 00:15:12,677through implementation research31500:15:12,877 --> 00:15:16,040may be by using peer supervisors.31600:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,743So these are the kind of things that the data should make us think,31700:15:20,943 --> 00:15:24,100bring together the partners and stakeholders31800:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,189and talk about what kind of intervention might work31900:15:27,389 --> 00:15:30,518to improve things in our own environment.32000:15:30,718 --> 00:15:35,772We had also addressed this issue of ivermectin coverage,32100:15:35,972 --> 00:15:37,670or compliance.32200:15:37,870 --> 00:15:39,743We were able to collect information32300:15:39,943 --> 00:15:41,448in about 5 countries,32400:15:41,648 --> 00:15:43,879over an 8-year period,32500:15:44,079 --> 00:15:48,916and found out how many people took or didn't take ivermectin,32600:15:49,116 --> 00:15:51,047out of those 8 opportunities,32700:15:51,247 --> 00:15:57,042and as you recall we did identify some particular groups at risk.32800:15:57,242 --> 00:15:59,213So the question is,32900:15:59,413 --> 00:16:01,698in these years leading up to the 2020s,33000:16:01,898 --> 00:16:03,775when we hope to eliminate the disease,33100:16:03,975 --> 00:16:07,401what interventions can we do33200:16:07,601 --> 00:16:11,876to make it easier to reach certain segments of the population33300:16:12,076 --> 00:16:14,084that are less likely to comply?33400:16:14,284 --> 00:16:16,584So basically:How can we reach women?33500:16:16,784 --> 00:16:18,709How can we reach youth?33600:16:18,909 --> 00:16:23,194Remember, people who are under 25 are less likely to comply.33700:16:23,394 --> 00:16:27,998How do we reach ethnic minorities that may be living in the community?33800:16:28,198 --> 00:16:30,161These are things we have to think about.33900:16:30,361 --> 00:16:34,032Is it a question of training the community distributors better?34000:16:34,232 --> 00:16:37,232Is it a question of ensuring that we have distributors34100:16:37,432 --> 00:16:39,129from the minority groups,34200:16:39,329 --> 00:16:41,962or distributors who are also women or youth?34300:16:42,049 --> 00:16:43,488What can we do?34400:16:43,563 --> 00:16:45,715Is there a way we can make it more convenient34500:16:45,802 --> 00:16:47,592for people to get their ivermectin?34600:16:47,654 --> 00:16:50,150These are the kinds of questions we need to be asking34700:16:50,350 --> 00:16:53,174to lead us to design, or update,34800:16:53,374 --> 00:16:55,688our interventions to make them more effective34900:16:55,888 --> 00:16:57,503and reach more people.35000:16:57,703 --> 00:16:59,662Well thank you very much for joining us35100:16:59,862 --> 00:17:03,352and we look forward to having you with us again35200:17:03,552 --> 00:17:05,015in the fourth chapter.35300:17:05,215 --> 00:17:06,235Thank you.
