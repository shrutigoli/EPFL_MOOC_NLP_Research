000:00:04,669 --> 00:00:08,012Hello, and welcome to the second module100:00:08,212 --> 00:00:11,845in our course on implementation research.200:00:12,020 --> 00:00:15,002In the first module you learned about the overview300:00:15,202 --> 00:00:17,751of what implementation research is about.400:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,325When we're doing implementation research we will be trying500:00:21,525 --> 00:00:25,234to decide on what important issues need to be studied,600:00:25,434 --> 00:00:27,354what interventions need to be tried.700:00:27,554 --> 00:00:31,129And so we need a needs assessment to learn about,800:00:31,329 --> 00:00:34,497what's going on with the programmes in our environment900:00:34,697 --> 00:00:38,819so that we can design good implementation research.1000:00:39,019 --> 00:00:45,675In this module I'll be joined with Uche Amazigo, who is right now1100:00:45,888 --> 00:00:51,293a Professor at the Nnamdi Azkiwe University in Nigeria.1200:00:51,493 --> 00:00:54,684She was formerly the Director of the African Programme1300:00:54,919 --> 00:00:57,559for Onchocerciasis Control. And I'm Bill Brieger,1400:00:57,759 --> 00:01:01,671Professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health,1500:01:01,871 --> 00:01:03,844the International Health Department.1600:01:04,068 --> 00:01:05,832So thank you for joining us.1700:01:06,032 --> 00:01:10,658One thing to remember about implementation research1800:01:10,858 --> 00:01:13,359is that it's done in a context.1900:01:13,559 --> 00:01:18,144And from the diagram, we can see that the context includes2000:01:18,394 --> 00:01:21,959the outer setting, the broader social, political2100:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,515and economic environment in which our programmes operate.2200:01:26,413 --> 00:01:31,132We have our inner setting, which includes all of the aspects2300:01:31,332 --> 00:01:33,353of the service delivery organization2400:01:33,553 --> 00:01:35,594and the people that they serve.2500:01:35,794 --> 00:01:40,113We then of course, are concerned about the people themselves2600:01:40,313 --> 00:01:43,101who they are, the individuals involved,2700:01:43,301 --> 00:01:48,742including the beneficiaries, policy makers, programme implementers.2800:01:48,982 --> 00:01:52,518And finally we have a process that we go about.2900:01:52,718 --> 00:01:56,797Again, even though this is not like basic laboratory research,3000:01:56,997 --> 00:02:01,049we still have to go through steps in an orderly way3100:02:01,249 --> 00:02:05,493so that we know that the product we get out of the research is valid.3200:02:05,693 --> 00:02:07,203And, of course, one of the first steps3300:02:07,403 --> 00:02:09,540as we're going to be talking about in this module3400:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,981is collecting information that we need to make decisions3500:02:13,169 --> 00:02:16,643about the kind of implementation that we're going to do.3600:02:17,497 --> 00:02:19,745Here we see an example of the outer setting,3700:02:19,945 --> 00:02:21,839the economic context.3800:02:22,039 --> 00:02:25,088Here we have a market in a small town in Nigeria.3900:02:25,288 --> 00:02:28,671But, again, people earn their living by farming.4000:02:28,871 --> 00:02:31,674They may be a poor community, and as you recall,4100:02:31,874 --> 00:02:36,831we're doing our modules about the infectious diseases of poverty.4200:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,471So we do need to consider those factors4300:02:39,671 --> 00:02:42,272when we are designing interventions.4400:02:42,472 --> 00:02:44,212We want to make sure that they are adapted4500:02:44,412 --> 00:02:48,828to that local environment, where the programme is being carried out.4600:02:49,378 --> 00:02:53,475We recognize, of course, there are national as well as global policies4700:02:53,675 --> 00:02:56,273that influence how the programme is carried out.4800:02:56,473 --> 00:03:00,191Funding, of course, comes from national level,4900:03:00,391 --> 00:03:03,035from Ministries of Health, international level5000:03:03,235 --> 00:03:05,126through things like the Global Fund.5100:03:05,326 --> 00:03:07,981So this again, is part of the broader environment.5200:03:08,181 --> 00:03:11,014And then there's the broader policy or legal environment5300:03:11,214 --> 00:03:13,438that makes it possible to deliver services,5400:03:13,977 --> 00:03:17,472that sets the guidance, the  technical guidance also,5500:03:17,672 --> 00:03:19,365of how we deliver our programmes.5600:03:20,852 --> 00:03:23,208Again, one thing we're concerned about5700:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,671from the external environment, whether it's5800:03:25,913 --> 00:03:27,858a national level or the global level,5900:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,639is that our programmes are held accountable.6000:03:31,839 --> 00:03:34,726If funding is being provided, there is this accountability6100:03:34,926 --> 00:03:37,627and so that influences the evaluation.6200:03:37,827 --> 00:03:40,996And again, what we're looking for is are we reaching our targets,6300:03:41,196 --> 00:03:43,236which is part of the evaluation.6400:03:43,436 --> 00:03:45,998The inner setting, as we can see here6500:03:46,198 --> 00:03:50,630a small health center in Southeastern Nigeria,6600:03:50,955 --> 00:03:53,448where women can come for antenatal care,6700:03:53,626 --> 00:03:55,481where they can bring children for vaccinations.6800:03:55,681 --> 00:03:58,340People who have common illnesses can come for treatment.6900:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,184And, if we're fortunate, we can have staff there7000:04:01,384 --> 00:04:03,643who reach out and train community health workers7100:04:03,843 --> 00:04:06,558to extend access to services.7200:04:06,819 --> 00:04:09,758So what we're concerned about is what goes on7300:04:09,963 --> 00:04:12,082in these service delivery settings.7400:04:12,557 --> 00:04:16,117Inside, you know, the personnel, the resources they have,7500:04:16,317 --> 00:04:21,088and again, the interaction with the community and the beneficiaries.7600:04:21,982 --> 00:04:26,696Each organization has its own culture, the way people do things,7700:04:26,896 --> 00:04:29,116the way they interact with each other,7800:04:29,316 --> 00:04:32,240things that they value, and we want to take that7900:04:32,440 --> 00:04:37,024into account when we're designing appropriate implementation research.8000:04:37,224 --> 00:04:40,247So, again, our needs assessment is to learn about8100:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,767these various factors.8200:04:43,369 --> 00:04:46,700We want to be sure that in the organization itself8300:04:46,900 --> 00:04:51,080that the people from the leadership to the frontline implementers8400:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,571are ready to change, are willing to change8500:04:54,771 --> 00:04:57,538in order to improve their service delivery.8600:04:58,350 --> 00:05:01,877And we're also concerned about the clients,8700:05:02,113 --> 00:05:03,913the consumers, the community members,8800:05:04,113 --> 00:05:06,801the beneficiaries, however you want to call them.8900:05:07,001 --> 00:05:11,212But again, if we do not offer a service that they appreciate9000:05:11,437 --> 00:05:14,215or that they have access to, then we will still not9100:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,667be reaching our targets.9200:05:15,867 --> 00:05:19,591So we definitely want to look carefully at this9300:05:19,769 --> 00:05:21,405and gather information.9400:05:21,587 --> 00:05:23,983It's important to stress that implementation research9500:05:24,183 --> 00:05:30,572happens in a real-life setting, under real-life conditions9600:05:30,772 --> 00:05:34,526within the routine delivery of services9700:05:34,726 --> 00:05:37,573Again, this may be a service to provide9800:05:37,773 --> 00:05:39,744intermittent preventive treatment of malaria9900:05:39,944 --> 00:05:42,884for pregnant women, or it may be at the community level10000:05:43,069 --> 00:05:45,367where we're doing community case management10100:05:45,567 --> 00:05:47,946for common childhood illnesses.10200:05:48,146 --> 00:05:52,510But we are looking at real-life programmes in real-life settings10300:05:52,710 --> 00:05:56,083to find out what works and trying new interventions10400:05:56,283 --> 00:05:59,496to make things work better, to give access to more people.10500:06:00,531 --> 00:06:04,900So we want to take into account the prevailing conditions10600:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,879but again, as we said, from the external environment10700:06:09,079 --> 00:06:13,629the political, social, economic, the local culture10800:06:13,829 --> 00:06:19,148and adapt programmes to fit this environment.10900:06:19,348 --> 00:06:22,446Now, in some research we're worried about external validity11000:06:22,646 --> 00:06:25,267but if we're trying to do implementation research11100:06:25,467 --> 00:06:29,388to improve the delivery of services in a particular setting11200:06:29,588 --> 00:06:32,601we want it to actually work in that setting.11300:06:32,801 --> 00:06:35,595So this is our challenge: to be real-life.11400:06:36,900 --> 00:06:40,921Again, when we're talking about who is doing this11500:06:41,121 --> 00:06:45,110yes, there maybe a core team of researchers11600:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,732but they don't operate alone.11700:06:47,932 --> 00:06:52,363We need involvement for all of those who are designing11800:06:52,563 --> 00:06:56,710managing, and using the programmes.11900:06:57,685 --> 00:07:01,380Again, whether this might be a programme for distributing12000:07:01,580 --> 00:07:05,749ivermectin to prevent river blindness or onchocerciasis.12100:07:06,538 --> 00:07:08,949Whether this is a programme to distribute bed nets12200:07:09,149 --> 00:07:12,802to prevent lymphatic filariasis or malaria,12300:07:13,002 --> 00:07:16,365we want to bring in all parties to find out12400:07:16,565 --> 00:07:18,274what is working, what is not working,12500:07:18,474 --> 00:07:22,139and how we can design and try something better.12600:07:22,339 --> 00:07:26,289So again, getting information from various sources to learn about this.12700:07:26,489 --> 00:07:31,174So what we want to do in this module is to facilitate12800:07:31,374 --> 00:07:35,666your learning about how do you analyze the context12900:07:35,866 --> 00:07:38,744that you're going to be working in and researching in?13000:07:38,944 --> 00:07:42,043How do you engage all the stakeholders,13100:07:42,243 --> 00:07:44,835from the policy makers to the community members13200:07:45,035 --> 00:07:48,930so that the programme is realistic for all of their needs?13300:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,939We want to get everyone's opinion about what are the bottlenecks13400:07:54,139 --> 00:07:57,681that maybe affecting our current interventions.13500:07:57,881 --> 00:08:00,969And then we want to get people's ideas13600:08:01,175 --> 00:08:03,942and help design an intervention that we can test13700:08:04,142 --> 00:08:06,621through implementation research.13800:08:06,821 --> 00:08:10,549This is the key issue, that unless we get good information13900:08:10,749 --> 00:08:13,918we won't have a good design to test.14000:08:14,672 --> 00:08:19,578Again, we cannot stress too often the need to involve14100:08:19,778 --> 00:08:23,375all of the stakeholders, all of the key parties14200:08:23,575 --> 00:08:28,107from the policy makers, programme managers, implementing staff,14300:08:28,307 --> 00:08:31,160frontline health workers, community health workers,14400:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,146community leaders, community organizations,14500:08:35,346 --> 00:08:38,390and of course, the beneficiaries themselves.14600:08:38,590 --> 00:08:41,309So all of these people need to be involved in this process14700:08:41,509 --> 00:08:42,965as we have said.14800:08:43,165 --> 00:08:46,042We also, again, recognize that this process14900:08:46,267 --> 00:08:51,335or the design of the intervention is an issue of strategies.15000:08:52,044 --> 00:08:55,286Now we assume at the beginning of any programme15100:08:55,486 --> 00:08:58,800that the people coming together to design that programme15200:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,948have a strategy, have a way of going about things.15300:09:02,148 --> 00:09:05,110Have a rationale that they have figured out15400:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,361what kind of activities they will do,15500:09:07,561 --> 00:09:08,986and what resources they will need.15600:09:09,186 --> 00:09:11,374These strategies should be planned15700:09:11,574 --> 00:09:13,387and they should be updated regularly.15800:09:14,262 --> 00:09:16,400But there may be some unplanned things happening.15900:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,675There maybe changes in the funding level.16000:09:19,875 --> 00:09:22,056There maybe changes in community response.16100:09:22,256 --> 00:09:24,555And we may find that people have adapted16200:09:24,755 --> 00:09:26,646or modified the original strategy.16300:09:26,846 --> 00:09:29,627We want to learn all of these things about the process16400:09:29,827 --> 00:09:33,315of the existing programmes and take that into account16500:09:33,544 --> 00:09:36,736in designing new interventions, and again be very specific16600:09:36,961 --> 00:09:39,149when we do that, what are the steps and processes16700:09:39,349 --> 00:09:44,256that we're hoping to test in this new approach?16800:09:45,131 --> 00:09:48,986One of the big challenges that we will be looking at16900:09:49,186 --> 00:09:52,955when we're gathering information about existing programmes,17000:09:53,155 --> 00:09:55,358in order to design new interventions17100:09:55,558 --> 00:09:57,290is whether things are working?17200:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,727Whether we're reaching our targets?17300:09:59,927 --> 00:10:04,105Let's look at the example of malaria.17400:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,548The Roll Back Malaria Partnership bringing together17500:10:07,748 --> 00:10:10,860public sector, private sector, international organizations,17600:10:11,060 --> 00:10:15,551many, many partners to try to achieve the goal17700:10:15,751 --> 00:10:17,733of bringing down deaths from malaria17800:10:17,933 --> 00:10:20,120and hopefully eventually eliminating it.17900:10:20,731 --> 00:10:22,699So this partnership was formed in '98.18000:10:22,899 --> 00:10:26,781In the year 2000, the African Heads of State18100:10:26,981 --> 00:10:31,294and the Ministers for Health and related partners, NGOs,18200:10:31,469 --> 00:10:35,705all gathered in Abuja and set targets for what all countries18300:10:35,905 --> 00:10:38,782wanted to achieve by the year 2010.18400:10:39,413 --> 00:10:41,819And that was basically a figure of 80 percent.18500:10:42,019 --> 00:10:45,611They wanted to be sure that 80 percent of particularly18600:10:45,799 --> 00:10:48,100vulnerable people like children under 5,18700:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,469or pregnant women were sleeping under bed nets18800:10:50,669 --> 00:10:54,023They wanted to make sure that 80 percent of people18900:10:54,223 --> 00:10:58,615when they got sick from malaria received the correct treatment,19000:10:58,815 --> 00:11:00,955in a timely manner within 24 hours.19100:11:01,155 --> 00:11:03,747They wanted to make sure that 80 percent of pregnant women19200:11:03,947 --> 00:11:08,957got intermittent preventive treatment through their antenatal care.19300:11:09,796 --> 00:11:12,616These targets were revised upwards a little bit.19400:11:12,816 --> 00:11:16,126Some of the donors said let's aim for 85 percent.19500:11:16,326 --> 00:11:20,599And then around 2009, the United Nations generally19600:11:20,799 --> 00:11:23,882started talking about universal health coverage.19700:11:24,594 --> 00:11:27,663And meaning that everybody should be protected by bed nets.19800:11:27,863 --> 00:11:30,159Everybody should get appropriate malaria treatment.19900:11:30,484 --> 00:11:33,439Well, let's just look at the question of the 80 percent,20000:11:34,482 --> 00:11:37,317because that's, you know, our first challenge.20100:11:37,517 --> 00:11:43,483So, from 2000 to 2010, was it possible for countries to meet that target20200:11:43,683 --> 00:11:46,855given the intervention designs that they had?20300:11:47,055 --> 00:11:51,169And those designs were largely through the existing health services.20400:11:51,369 --> 00:11:56,659Distributing them at the services at clinics, the bed nets.20500:11:56,859 --> 00:12:00,053There would be campaigns also for the bed nets.20600:12:00,253 --> 00:12:03,005So the question is, did these interventions work?20700:12:03,922 --> 00:12:09,153So the challenge we had is that we didn't really achieve20800:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,449our full coverage, because what we were hoping20900:12:11,649 --> 00:12:14,062is that if we had achieved full coverage  by 2010,21000:12:14,262 --> 00:12:17,897and sustained that, the deaths would really, seriously drop.21100:12:18,110 --> 00:12:21,037We can see here information that was available21200:12:21,237 --> 00:12:27,121around this 2010 target year, maybe 2009, 2011,21300:12:27,321 --> 00:12:31,292but basically around that time information was available21400:12:31,492 --> 00:12:34,902through a number of sources that we'll talk about in a later chapter.21500:12:35,102 --> 00:12:39,343This particular source is included in demographic and health surveys,21600:12:39,543 --> 00:12:43,799National Health Information systems, but what we saw is that21700:12:43,999 --> 00:12:48,012for one of the targets, pregnant women sleeping21800:12:48,212 --> 00:12:55,732under bed nets every night, no place achieved the 80 percent goal.21900:12:56,201 --> 00:12:59,033It was really a big challenge. And nobody could make it.22000:12:59,233 --> 00:13:02,589We found similarly that the same thing for intermittent22100:13:02,789 --> 00:13:05,489preventive treatment, for pregnant women.22200:13:05,689 --> 00:13:11,160In fact, as we're recording now in 2016, that goal still has not been met.22300:13:11,974 --> 00:13:15,124So there are some challenges, we are finding that22400:13:15,324 --> 00:13:19,801mortality did drop because we did increase the number of people22500:13:20,001 --> 00:13:21,929who had access to these preventive services,22600:13:22,129 --> 00:13:24,527and increased the number of people who got22700:13:24,727 --> 00:13:27,187appropriate treatment and didn't die.22800:13:27,387 --> 00:13:31,251But we didn't achieve zero mortality by 2015,22900:13:31,451 --> 00:13:33,769which as some of you may recall, is also the year23000:13:33,969 --> 00:13:37,695where the Millennium Development Goals were to be achieved,23100:13:37,895 --> 00:13:41,147including those things related to malaria.23200:13:41,472 --> 00:13:45,002So at any rate, it's not just enough to say, oh, we're sorry23300:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,461we didn't make that target, we want to find out why.23400:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,751And we want to plan new ways to reach people, to give them access23500:13:52,951 --> 00:13:56,966to these services, so that we can achieve targets.23600:13:57,594 --> 00:14:01,283So this is, you know, our major goal, can we learn?23700:14:01,483 --> 00:14:04,296And of course, just from this information, we've learned23800:14:04,496 --> 00:14:06,381that we didn't achieve the goal but we need to gather23900:14:06,581 --> 00:14:11,243more information to find out why and figure out what we can do better.24000:14:11,443 --> 00:14:17,529One way of understanding programmes and achievements,24100:14:17,729 --> 00:14:21,043is the idea of programme stages.24200:14:21,243 --> 00:14:25,881Many of our programmes to control infectious diseases24300:14:26,081 --> 00:14:27,911of poverty have stages.24400:14:28,111 --> 00:14:30,754We start off where the programmeis just being implemented24500:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,765and we need to scale up.24600:14:32,965 --> 00:14:37,448This was what the period of 2000 to 2010 was supposed to be24700:14:37,648 --> 00:14:39,304for many of the malaria interventions,24800:14:39,504 --> 00:14:42,492scaling up, so we achieved that 80 percent,24900:14:42,692 --> 00:14:44,229or more, hopefully more.25000:14:44,429 --> 00:14:48,978The idea then was sustained control so that you could25100:14:49,178 --> 00:14:54,453keep that level of coverage maintained until 2015.25200:14:54,653 --> 00:14:56,808If that had happened, we would have seen25300:14:57,008 --> 00:14:59,589major drops, we probably would have seen25400:14:59,789 --> 00:15:03,388zero malaria deaths which had been the goal.25500:15:03,588 --> 00:15:06,464Again, as we've mentioned, we hadn't achieved that.25600:15:06,664 --> 00:15:10,468If we had achieved that, we would have gotten to the level25700:15:10,668 --> 00:15:14,506of what they call pre-elimination, where when you send people25800:15:14,706 --> 00:15:18,091for testing for malaria, when you suspect that25900:15:18,291 --> 00:15:21,039you find that less than 5 percent of them26000:15:21,239 --> 00:15:23,621with fevers actually have malaria.26100:15:23,821 --> 00:15:26,266So that means other diseases are affecting people26200:15:26,466 --> 00:15:28,404but malaria has dropped.26300:15:28,604 --> 00:15:31,547At that point, we want to redesign, rethink26400:15:31,747 --> 00:15:33,152reorient our programme.26500:15:33,352 --> 00:15:36,058And implementation research is very much26600:15:36,258 --> 00:15:40,150important in that process, because this new orientation26700:15:40,350 --> 00:15:42,392at that stage would require better surveillance,26800:15:42,592 --> 00:15:46,317better case detection, better response to outbreaks.26900:15:46,517 --> 00:15:49,789So we need to have interventions that will do that.27000:15:50,164 --> 00:15:52,649If we're successful in maintaining that27100:15:52,849 --> 00:15:54,726and keep bringing down the number of cases,27200:15:54,926 --> 00:15:57,869then we will get to the phase of malaria elimination27300:15:58,069 --> 00:16:02,225where there would be less than a one per thousand people27400:16:02,425 --> 00:16:08,175ultimately to the point where there are no cases acquired locally.27500:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,252There maybe a few people crossing the border27600:16:10,452 --> 00:16:13,573as they do, and bringing it in but we try to catch them quickly.27700:16:13,773 --> 00:16:18,581So by that point, if we have no malaria cases occurring27800:16:18,781 --> 00:16:23,581we're very vigilant, we have the right interventions27900:16:23,781 --> 00:16:26,981to detect cases in case anything happens.28000:16:27,181 --> 00:16:30,591This happened with the Guinea worm, they actually set rewards28100:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,760for people who could find a Guinea worm.28200:16:32,960 --> 00:16:36,353And, actually, no one did but it certainly kept people aware28300:16:36,553 --> 00:16:38,727and that was an interesting intervention.28400:16:38,927 --> 00:16:42,828So ultimately, if we can prevent transmission28500:16:43,028 --> 00:16:45,222and the re-introduction from other countries28600:16:45,422 --> 00:16:50,609for 3 years, WHO could certify a country as being free of malaria.28700:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,297So that's an ultimate goal.28800:16:53,497 --> 00:16:55,687At this point, I'm going to turn the floor over28900:16:55,887 --> 00:16:59,501to Uche Amazigo, who will talk to us about some of29000:16:59,701 --> 00:17:03,605the practical reasons why we may have missed our targets.29100:17:04,900 --> 00:17:08,072There are several reasons why programme targets are missed29200:17:08,706 --> 00:17:12,156or programmes are unable to scale up.29300:17:12,648 --> 00:17:16,874I shall present important stakeholders that provide29400:17:17,074 --> 00:17:21,600useful information in implementation research29500:17:21,800 --> 00:17:24,598to understand programme challenges.29600:17:25,595 --> 00:17:30,984As Bill explained earlier, health providers missed the target29700:17:31,184 --> 00:17:35,628for malaria control, despite the Abuja declaration29800:17:35,828 --> 00:17:38,395by the African Heads of States29900:17:38,595 --> 00:17:42,236and the commitments of donors and countries.30000:17:42,436 --> 00:17:46,634Through needs assessment, malaria programmes can determine30100:17:46,834 --> 00:17:49,713the reasons they could not meet their targets30200:17:49,913 --> 00:17:51,978for the different settings.30300:17:52,178 --> 00:17:56,000For instance, programmes can miss targets30400:17:56,200 --> 00:17:59,661because of poor supervision by health workers30500:17:59,861 --> 00:18:05,235or inadequate investment in monitoring programme activities.30600:18:05,435 --> 00:18:13,861I mean lack of follow up can lead to non-use or misuse of commodities.30700:18:14,449 --> 00:18:19,482As you can see in the slide, insecticide treated bed net30800:18:19,682 --> 00:18:25,272is being used by children for a football goal post in this community.30900:18:25,472 --> 00:18:30,163Inadequate investment in annual health education of beneficiaries31000:18:30,363 --> 00:18:34,306can lead to misuse of commodities.31100:18:34,506 --> 00:18:38,172Needs assessments by programmes should find out31200:18:38,372 --> 00:18:40,609why these things happen.31300:18:40,809 --> 00:18:45,493Stock-outs from poor planning has in various settings31400:18:45,693 --> 00:18:50,077led to implementation problem and health programmes31500:18:50,277 --> 00:18:53,067not achieving their goals.31600:18:53,703 --> 00:18:59,524Clinic experiences also offer insight into programme implementation problems.31700:18:59,724 --> 00:19:06,244For example, antenatal clinics may not be reaching all clients31800:19:06,444 --> 00:19:10,188with malaria prevention and de-worming medicines.31900:19:11,338 --> 00:19:15,377Needs assessment for implementation research32000:19:15,577 --> 00:19:20,180will help the research team to respond to such questions as:32100:19:20,920 --> 00:19:24,548Do women attend late or miss appointments?32200:19:24,748 --> 00:19:29,167Do health staff not order enough medicines and supplies32300:19:29,367 --> 00:19:31,138in a timely manner?32400:19:31,338 --> 00:19:35,078Do health staff not record all services delivered?32500:19:35,912 --> 00:19:39,597Implementation research requires also gathering32600:19:39,797 --> 00:19:42,970appropriate data from programme beneficiaries:32700:19:43,170 --> 00:19:47,730the communities, schools, work sites and others32800:19:47,930 --> 00:19:51,275utilizing the programme in order to understand32900:19:51,475 --> 00:19:53,996clients’perception of the programme,33000:19:54,525 --> 00:20:00,611Iimplementation changes or the adaptations health providers33100:20:00,811 --> 00:20:03,850and programme managers need to make.33200:20:04,050 --> 00:20:08,940Community members may not adhere to annual ivermectin doses33300:20:09,140 --> 00:20:12,842because the programme staff delivered ivermectin33400:20:13,042 --> 00:20:17,103at the collection point after the members of the community33500:20:17,303 --> 00:20:19,677had moved to their farmlands.33600:20:19,895 --> 00:20:22,640This has happened in some sites.33700:20:23,232 --> 00:20:27,828Programmes that aim to control and eliminate infectious diseases33800:20:28,028 --> 00:20:32,777of poverty, do not work only within the health sector.33900:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,469The schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminth34000:20:37,669 --> 00:20:41,273control programmes are primarily school-based.34100:20:42,029 --> 00:20:47,264These diseases affect attendance, retention, completion34200:20:47,464 --> 00:20:52,211and learning ability of school age children in many countries.34300:20:52,411 --> 00:20:57,124To design a better way of scaling of these programmes,34400:20:57,324 --> 00:21:00,410and improving coverage in local settings34500:21:00,610 --> 00:21:05,373it is important to include schools in the needs assessment.34600:21:05,573 --> 00:21:11,125Finally, do not forget that infectious diseases of poverty34700:21:11,325 --> 00:21:16,909also impact on the ability of workers to function in their jobs34800:21:17,163 --> 00:21:22,013whether these be in farming, construction, commerce,34900:21:22,213 --> 00:21:23,982or clerical employment.35000:21:24,716 --> 00:21:29,372Worksites and schools must be included, considered,35100:21:29,572 --> 00:21:34,548in designing needs assessments for those programmes35200:21:34,748 --> 00:21:37,842that include these groups as beneficiaries.35300:21:38,498 --> 00:21:42,645In designing new programmes or to better understand35400:21:42,845 --> 00:21:46,059implementation problems of a public health programme35500:21:46,259 --> 00:21:49,954not reaching its goal, we need to pay attention35600:21:50,154 --> 00:21:53,104to settings and context.35700:21:54,013 --> 00:21:58,844Thank you for listening and please join us for Chapter 2.
