000:00:04,634 --> 00:00:08,534Welcome to our second chapter in our module on needs assessment100:00:08,719 --> 00:00:12,394for implementation research. Uche and I will be sharing with you200:00:12,593 --> 00:00:16,906some of our experiences in gathering information to plan this research300:00:17,118 --> 00:00:19,006so we hope you enjoy this session.400:00:19,195 --> 00:00:23,920Like all research there are 3 basic methods for gathering information500:00:24,143 --> 00:00:26,780so this doesn't differ for implementation research.600:00:26,982 --> 00:00:30,232We're concerned about reviewing documents.700:00:30,438 --> 00:00:35,788Most programmes that we are going to be studying, that we're going to be800:00:36,016 --> 00:00:40,428designing are built on programmes that have been implemented already.900:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,233There may be gaps, there may be problems1000:00:43,449 --> 00:00:46,137but there are always reports and documents to tell us1100:00:46,347 --> 00:00:49,397how the programme has done, where it's done well,1200:00:49,605 --> 00:00:52,792where it has challenges and gaps and problems.1300:00:52,982 --> 00:00:56,057So we need to collect existing documents to help us1400:00:56,285 --> 00:01:00,410understand what's going on and plan for new interventions1500:01:00,601 --> 00:01:02,901that may help the programme work better.1600:01:03,106 --> 00:01:05,868We're also concerned about talking with people.1700:01:06,073 --> 00:01:09,185We have many ways of doing that but we're concerned about talking1800:01:09,378 --> 00:01:12,790with the beneficiaries of the programme, the people who have taken1900:01:13,002 --> 00:01:18,402part in it; who have opinions about whether the service has been2000:01:18,631 --> 00:01:21,731good for them or not. We're also interested in talking to people2100:01:21,937 --> 00:01:25,850who'd never use the service to find out more about their opinions2200:01:26,044 --> 00:01:28,307and we can do this in a number of ways.2300:01:28,660 --> 00:01:34,135And finally we're interested in gathering information through observing.2400:01:34,337 --> 00:01:37,937We will go to the place where the service is being offered.2500:01:38,132 --> 00:01:41,144We'll see what's happening there. We'll go to the community where2600:01:41,336 --> 00:01:45,361there are community interventions being delivered and see what's happening2700:01:45,622 --> 00:01:50,484So together as a team we will work together and find out what is2800:01:50,682 --> 00:01:54,557happening with this particular programme. We're going to be looking2900:01:54,772 --> 00:01:59,172at who is affected. Are we reaching the right people or not?3000:01:59,397 --> 00:02:02,734And why is this programme succeeding or not?3100:02:02,944 --> 00:02:06,081In other words why we might need to develop and try3200:02:06,272 --> 00:02:10,635a new intervention. The first big question we have is3300:02:10,856 --> 00:02:14,331with documents, what can they tell us?3400:02:15,151 --> 00:02:18,851We have a picture here of the malaria indicator survey3500:02:19,057 --> 00:02:22,432that is from Malawi. The people that do our3600:02:22,668 --> 00:02:25,881demographic and health surveys for example3700:02:26,121 --> 00:02:30,446have the malaria information survey. They do HIV surveys3800:02:30,956 --> 00:02:33,993but the idea of these surveys is at a national level3900:02:34,195 --> 00:02:39,058we can learn about people who use and don't use particular services.4000:02:39,525 --> 00:02:43,775And hopefully be able to distinguish different segments of the population.4100:02:44,085 --> 00:02:46,872Generally what we're concerned about in these documents4200:02:47,083 --> 00:02:51,508is the performance of the programme. Is it meeting its objectives?4300:02:51,726 --> 00:02:54,863Is it meeting its goals? Is it meeting its targets?4400:02:55,726 --> 00:02:59,201Hopefully the reports, some of them, will give us information on4500:02:59,418 --> 00:03:02,593reasons why that they may not have succeeded, 4600:03:02,848 --> 00:03:06,560again giving us ideas for new interventions.4700:03:07,219 --> 00:03:09,956It'll tell us funding gaps. One of the biggest challenges4800:03:10,172 --> 00:03:13,897of course in delivering the programmes is not having enough funds4900:03:14,097 --> 00:03:18,559or the funds not arriving on time. We want to learn something about5000:03:18,794 --> 00:03:21,656the stakeholder commitment; all those people involved:5100:03:21,867 --> 00:03:24,879the policy makers, the programme managers, other people.5200:03:25,102 --> 00:03:29,915Are they really committed to implementing this programme?5300:03:30,435 --> 00:03:34,798And finally, summing all this up, we'll see specific areas5400:03:35,014 --> 00:03:38,052for improving the programme that can give us ideas for5500:03:38,237 --> 00:03:42,462implementation research. Again, we're basically interested5600:03:42,684 --> 00:03:46,496in gathering information that will help us design better programmes.5700:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,355Again as we mentioned yesterday, we're talking about in5800:03:49,548 --> 00:03:54,098a specific locality so that the implementation research is5900:03:54,310 --> 00:04:00,235very helpful to improving programme access, programme performance6000:04:00,478 --> 00:04:02,603in a particular context.6100:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,250Here we can see some examples of the major documents that we6200:04:06,452 --> 00:04:09,514may run across. These are particularly related to the6300:04:09,719 --> 00:04:13,031major sources of funding whether it is international agencies6400:04:13,266 --> 00:04:16,516or government agencies. We've talked a bit about the6500:04:16,962 --> 00:04:22,975global fund. The Global Fund gives money for malaria, TB and HIV programmes6600:04:23,222 --> 00:04:29,359and they provide reports back to countries at least every 6 months6700:04:29,569 --> 00:04:33,644about the progress being made. Those reports are geared toward6800:04:33,850 --> 00:04:38,238looking at the targets the country set so we'll see some examples6900:04:38,472 --> 00:04:43,222of how progress reports can help us understand where programmes7000:04:43,441 --> 00:04:47,604need to improve. We've talked about again, the demographic and health7100:04:47,813 --> 00:04:51,388survey and its related surveys, the malaria indicator survey.7200:04:51,598 --> 00:04:56,811This gives us a population basis for understanding access7300:04:57,012 --> 00:05:01,324and utilisation of services, the uptake of interventions,7400:05:01,535 --> 00:05:04,423whether it's intermittent preventative treatment for7500:05:04,641 --> 00:05:07,928malaria by pregnant women; whether pregnant women even attend7600:05:08,154 --> 00:05:11,417antenatal care so we can get good information.7700:05:11,684 --> 00:05:17,321This is done maybe every 2-3 years alternating between the malaria survey7800:05:17,530 --> 00:05:20,618and the demographic and health survey so it's not done7900:05:20,825 --> 00:05:26,500that often. What we can find in real time is information from our8000:05:26,896 --> 00:05:29,846national health management information system.8100:05:30,379 --> 00:05:32,754Back to this question of the antenatal clinic,8200:05:32,966 --> 00:05:36,041they have to provide monthly data on the number of women8300:05:36,252 --> 00:05:41,802who came for 1,2,3 antenatal visits. Of those who registered8400:05:42,087 --> 00:05:45,625they want to say who received the intermittent preventative treatment8500:05:45,830 --> 00:05:50,5051,2,3 or more times. They want to record and report the number of8600:05:50,715 --> 00:05:53,715women who were given an insecticide treated bed net8700:05:53,923 --> 00:05:57,260so this is ongoing data that can help us understand whether8800:05:57,466 --> 00:06:00,466we're achieving programme goals or not.8900:06:00,826 --> 00:06:04,563We also have published and unpublished literature9000:06:04,763 --> 00:06:10,113about programmes. University and Ministry of Health9100:06:10,333 --> 00:06:13,921research institutes do quite a lot of studies about9200:06:14,138 --> 00:06:18,463these common issues and these reports can help us understand9300:06:18,690 --> 00:06:22,015where we have gaps, where we have successes.9400:06:22,287 --> 00:06:27,562Finally, again from the ordinary supervision processes9500:06:27,784 --> 00:06:31,534in the Ministry of Health, we have data on quality assurance9600:06:31,745 --> 00:06:36,170or quality performance by health workers and by the overall service9700:06:36,402 --> 00:06:40,289and that can point us in the direction of needs for9800:06:40,507 --> 00:06:43,619better interventions or improving interventions and9900:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,358therefore our implementation research.10000:06:46,956 --> 00:06:50,881In addition to these more global or national type of reports10100:06:51,090 --> 00:06:55,552and documents we do recognize that each programme10200:06:56,023 --> 00:06:59,735within a country will generate its own reports.10300:07:00,047 --> 00:07:05,547We have reports that come in especially after bed net distribution10400:07:05,764 --> 00:07:08,539campaigns on utilization of the bed nets.10500:07:08,836 --> 00:07:13,086We have reports from the programme that controls onchocerciasis10600:07:13,291 --> 00:07:17,891in a country about the uptake of ivermectin that's used to10700:07:18,099 --> 00:07:22,049control the disease. We have reports on the10800:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,667proportion of eligible people that take it,10900:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,955the proportion of eligible communities11000:07:27,166 --> 00:07:30,429so those specific programmereports are available.11100:07:30,825 --> 00:07:34,825We, in some cases communities are actively involved in monitoring11200:07:35,026 --> 00:07:38,201their health programmes and they develop their own simple11300:07:38,394 --> 00:07:41,319reporting system. We may need to visit those communities11400:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,335to see those reports but it's important to learn how things11500:07:44,565 --> 00:07:50,353are functioning on the ground. Most agencies, most NGOs have11600:07:50,566 --> 00:07:54,616annual performance reports and it's important to read these11700:07:54,847 --> 00:07:58,410to see in the agency's own eyes where they think they're doing well,11800:07:58,623 --> 00:08:00,873what they want to do to improve.11900:08:01,256 --> 00:08:06,069As we said before there is university based research but12000:08:06,299 --> 00:08:08,749also university students have projects to do and12100:08:08,951 --> 00:08:11,026they go out in the field and do these projects12200:08:11,221 --> 00:08:13,633and write them up so we do need to be in touch12300:08:13,854 --> 00:08:16,467with the different departments in the medical school or12400:08:16,663 --> 00:08:20,413the social sciences who may go out and collect information.12500:08:20,593 --> 00:08:23,968These student reports would be available for us to look at12600:08:24,156 --> 00:08:25,293and learn from.12700:08:26,307 --> 00:08:29,669Another thing too is that even though we may be doing a12800:08:29,882 --> 00:08:35,670programmeon malaria we can learn from other programmes12900:08:35,858 --> 00:08:39,958and the example of the African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control13000:08:40,173 --> 00:08:43,623is a good one to think about other programmes learning from.13100:08:44,126 --> 00:08:49,126Way back in 1978 the Alma-Ata Declaration stressed the importance13200:08:49,342 --> 00:08:52,730of village health workers, community health workers,13300:08:52,942 --> 00:08:57,767but this was not followed through. Eventually the African Programme for13400:08:57,999 --> 00:09:00,949Onchocerciasis came along and developed something called13500:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,310community directed treatment with ivermectin where the13600:09:04,532 --> 00:09:09,269community took charge of annual distribution of its own ivermectin13700:09:09,494 --> 00:09:13,119in a way that it wanted to do it itself and of course kept13800:09:13,325 --> 00:09:17,663its records and reported back. This programme became quite successful13900:09:17,877 --> 00:09:21,702throughout up to now I think about 18 countries, endemic countries14000:09:21,920 --> 00:09:24,520in Africa and people were watching this.14100:09:24,751 --> 00:09:28,476We hadn't had information on the side, thatother programmes14200:09:28,674 --> 00:09:31,924whether in agriculture, whether other disease control programmes,14300:09:32,123 --> 00:09:36,435immunization programmes were latching on to this and so14400:09:37,551 --> 00:09:41,451later, implementation research was done to see if we could14500:09:41,663 --> 00:09:45,025systematically add on things like distribution of bed nets,14600:09:45,687 --> 00:09:49,637distribution of community-based treatment for malaria,14700:09:49,844 --> 00:09:54,144distribution and community- based delivery of vitamin A,14800:09:54,968 --> 00:10:00,668observation of TB; directly observe treatment in the village.14900:10:00,927 --> 00:10:04,502These were some of the things that were adapted as we went along.15000:10:04,933 --> 00:10:10,608The Lymphatic Filariasis Programme also adapted the CDTi model.15100:10:10,865 --> 00:10:17,402So yes, we can read reports and learn and adapt those to other programmes.15200:10:17,893 --> 00:10:24,093We had mentioned Global Fund earlier and just to be sure that we know15300:10:24,293 --> 00:10:28,918what these progress reports look like, I anonymously extracted one15400:10:29,132 --> 00:10:33,620of these for you to see but like I said these come out every 6 months15500:10:33,824 --> 00:10:38,536and you can see that the country has set its own targets.15600:10:38,822 --> 00:10:43,347For example the level 1 target: people trained.15700:10:43,574 --> 00:10:50,574They had set a target for the period of over 8000 people to be trained15800:10:50,827 --> 00:10:55,352in anti-malarial treatment; health workers, community volunteers etc.15900:10:55,677 --> 00:10:59,414and as you can see in the reporting period they achieved only about16000:10:59,622 --> 00:11:05,285a third of their goal. Now sometimes this is a bit frightening but16100:11:05,525 --> 00:11:10,188the Global Fund does provide funding for people to do implementation16200:11:10,389 --> 00:11:13,351research to learn how to improve their programme.16300:11:13,547 --> 00:11:18,735This should be an activity that spurs people on to try to16400:11:18,916 --> 00:11:24,428improve what they're doing. We see also here that in terms of16500:11:24,731 --> 00:11:28,069the number of adults in this case who received the appropriate16600:11:28,289 --> 00:11:32,064malaria treatment, they had a target of 9 million16700:11:32,327 --> 00:11:36,265and again they reached less than a third of the people.16800:11:37,076 --> 00:11:40,388This should tell them are we delivering this in the right way?16900:11:40,612 --> 00:11:44,487Can we design a better implementation process?17000:11:44,752 --> 00:11:48,440Again this type of data from reports can guide us.17100:11:49,043 --> 00:11:54,018Here is an extract from a malaria information or demographic17200:11:54,223 --> 00:12:00,986and health survey report to let us know about the achievements.17300:12:01,520 --> 00:12:06,782We know that targets have been set for example for malaria control.17400:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,646They were set back in the year 2000 at the Abuja Declaration17500:12:10,887 --> 00:12:15,537for achieving by 2010 80% coverage of all these interventions.17600:12:15,983 --> 00:12:19,095Here we can see interventions like sleeping under a bed net17700:12:20,166 --> 00:12:24,279for both children and pregnant women.17800:12:25,253 --> 00:12:31,016So basically we can see that the percentage that was achieved17900:12:32,575 --> 00:12:37,313either sleeping under a treated net or any net18000:12:37,903 --> 00:12:42,690was very low for both the pregnant women and the children.18100:12:42,932 --> 00:12:46,345This should raise questions in our mind, why is it?18200:12:46,555 --> 00:12:50,993Why are we not reaching people? And so again, opportunities to learn18300:12:51,220 --> 00:12:55,545so that we can plan implementation research.18400:12:56,562 --> 00:13:00,874From our health information system; as I said before18500:13:01,069 --> 00:13:05,006we get reports on a regular basis and so you can summarize18600:13:05,228 --> 00:13:09,778those for a certain period. Here we have information from18700:13:10,014 --> 00:13:14,6763 major districts in Burkina Faso for 2015.18800:13:14,910 --> 00:13:19,848We can see that for reaching pregnant women with the first dose18900:13:20,063 --> 00:13:23,125and this again is based on the denominator of the19000:13:23,351 --> 00:13:26,888number of women who registered for ANC in the first place19100:13:27,094 --> 00:13:30,969which was relatively high in that country so they reached 82%19200:13:31,179 --> 00:13:34,491with the first dose. They're doing pretty good with the second dose;19300:13:34,705 --> 00:13:38,53079%. Not much of a drop off but with this new introduction of19400:13:38,741 --> 00:13:43,428a third dose, they only reached about half of the people who registered.19500:13:43,651 --> 00:13:46,451This tells them, okay what are we going to do about this?19600:13:46,632 --> 00:13:51,144How are we going to improve the delivery of IPTp3?19700:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,664What interventions do we need?19800:13:54,247 --> 00:13:56,585We mentioned the issue of quality assurance;19900:13:56,795 --> 00:14:01,545performance quality and here we see the graph20000:14:01,745 --> 00:14:04,645showing observations with a checklist20100:14:04,842 --> 00:14:07,042of community health workers who are20200:14:07,238 --> 00:14:10,276performing case management tasks in the village;20300:14:10,576 --> 00:14:12,739malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea.20400:14:13,009 --> 00:14:17,797There were 3 things that were being recorded and summarized:20500:14:18,116 --> 00:14:23,103Did the community health worker take a good history20600:14:23,582 --> 00:14:29,370and check for example, for temperature of the child?20700:14:29,669 --> 00:14:33,332Did the community health worker actually perform a20800:14:33,548 --> 00:14:37,986rapid diagnostic test for those who were suspected of malaria?20900:14:38,339 --> 00:14:42,402And did the community health worker perform the correct21000:14:42,627 --> 00:14:46,877case management procedures for whatever the condition was.21100:14:47,095 --> 00:14:51,558As we said malaria, pneumonia, diarrhea or in case of unknown21200:14:51,777 --> 00:14:54,690they would be expected to refer.21300:14:54,929 --> 00:14:59,179So, over the 5 rounds which occurred about once a quarter,21400:14:59,408 --> 00:15:04,083we can see general improvement but what we can see is that21500:15:04,296 --> 00:15:10,021out of all of the 3 skill areas for these community health workers21600:15:10,398 --> 00:15:15,510the area of history taking in examination was the poorest.21700:15:15,833 --> 00:15:19,833It's that history taking that leads us to want to do a test,21800:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,517know what illness we're managing. We want to think about21900:15:24,942 --> 00:15:27,967why is this? Why is this history taking difficult?22000:15:28,188 --> 00:15:31,663They've improved other areas, what can we do about this?22100:15:31,935 --> 00:15:36,260Of course we have performance information from health workers22200:15:36,460 --> 00:15:40,922in clinics and other places, so observing health workers22300:15:41,123 --> 00:15:43,698is an important source of information for our22400:15:43,898 --> 00:15:46,385implementation research needs assessment.22500:15:46,970 --> 00:15:51,595Okay, another thing we need to consider is that health has impacts22600:15:51,799 --> 00:15:56,474on other sectors of society so we can learn about22700:15:56,881 --> 00:16:00,543implementation research needs in other places such as schools.22800:16:00,879 --> 00:16:03,566A number of interventions have been done to improve22900:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,980school health and the health of children affected by the23000:16:07,220 --> 00:16:11,082infectious diseases of poverty. One study that we see here23100:16:11,287 --> 00:16:15,912used children to report on whether bed nets were used at home.23200:16:16,349 --> 00:16:19,524So the school provides a window into the community.23300:16:19,835 --> 00:16:24,773And so the information that was gathered here23400:16:24,970 --> 00:16:27,495was found to be comparable to what could be gathered23500:16:27,679 --> 00:16:29,816through a community survey and they realized that23600:16:29,996 --> 00:16:33,059schools were a great place to gather information about health23700:16:33,273 --> 00:16:36,174not just of the children but of the community.23800:16:36,356 --> 00:16:40,531One thing of course is that schools keep records on attendance.23900:16:41,137 --> 00:16:44,236They keep records on people who drop out24000:16:45,258 --> 00:16:48,096and so we can learn from those records24100:16:48,335 --> 00:16:52,272especially if the teachers have recorded the reasons for absences.24200:16:53,118 --> 00:16:57,031In a project in Western Kenya that looked at school days missed24300:16:57,304 --> 00:17:01,503they could see that malaria was a major suspected cause of24400:17:01,715 --> 00:17:04,827these children being absent. Then the question is24500:17:05,041 --> 00:17:09,279what kind of interventions might be appropriate based in the school24600:17:09,592 --> 00:17:13,854and for the children themselves or based in the school24700:17:14,063 --> 00:17:15,939but reaching out into the community.24800:17:16,248 --> 00:17:19,073By looking at these other sectors like education,24900:17:19,314 --> 00:17:23,776we can get ideas of improving community health generally.25000:17:24,158 --> 00:17:27,458Finally we get a lot of information from worksites.25100:17:27,794 --> 00:17:30,006Now in many of the countries where we work25200:17:30,114 --> 00:17:34,739a lot of the worksites are informal. You may have a sawmill somewhere.25300:17:34,938 --> 00:17:37,338You have farmers. You may have auto-mechanics. And25400:17:37,549 --> 00:17:41,237so they're not like a big industry that keeps records but25500:17:41,592 --> 00:17:44,555of course you still do have records from places like25600:17:45,210 --> 00:17:50,547Soft drink bottling factories, there’re assembly plants for different25700:17:50,778 --> 00:17:55,329kinds of machines. There are the more white collar jobs25800:17:55,532 --> 00:17:57,819like working in a bank, accountancy so there are25900:17:58,036 --> 00:18:02,262records about absences. In many countries you'll find that26000:18:02,491 --> 00:18:06,553malaria is a major source of absenteeism and also if it's a26100:18:06,773 --> 00:18:10,335company they probably have a health plan and they pay for it26200:18:10,533 --> 00:18:13,258so they want to know what is happening to their workers.26300:18:13,460 --> 00:18:16,773Their records would be fairly good. A study that was done in26400:18:16,981 --> 00:18:21,656Kenya and Nigeria did go to the factories, did go to the worksites,26500:18:21,860 --> 00:18:25,897did talk to workers about their experiences and as you can see26600:18:26,109 --> 00:18:29,222this study reported some of the information about malaria26700:18:29,446 --> 00:18:32,859in particular and seeing that yes, adults perceive themselves26800:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,585as having malaria quite a lot. They did perceive themselves as26900:18:36,792 --> 00:18:40,542missing workdays which is important for them if they're on a27000:18:40,764 --> 00:18:44,164daily salary; it's important for their family but also27100:18:44,356 --> 00:18:47,918not only are children missing work but parents, especially mothers27200:18:48,149 --> 00:18:51,850and caregivers would miss work to take care of the sick child.27300:18:52,207 --> 00:18:55,207This is the kind of thing that we can learn from the workplace.27400:18:55,911 --> 00:18:59,574Again, the workplace is not a health delivery site per se27500:18:59,784 --> 00:19:02,846but it certainly has implications because the workers live27600:19:03,040 --> 00:19:06,253in the community, they get sick but also there are records27700:19:06,469 --> 00:19:09,881that we can use to find out. And can we design interventions27800:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,350that are appropriate for workers and in worksites?27900:19:13,598 --> 00:19:17,473At this point I'm going to turn the talk over to Uche28000:19:17,676 --> 00:19:20,676and she'll take us through the sections on interviews and28100:19:20,905 --> 00:19:24,905talking with people and in addition, to observational work.28200:19:25,110 --> 00:19:26,160So thank you.28300:19:26,836 --> 00:19:29,823I will continue from where Bill stopped to mention other28400:19:30,021 --> 00:19:35,159data sources necessary and often used to determine implementation28500:19:35,478 --> 00:19:38,303research needs. From all surveys,28600:19:38,515 --> 00:19:44,203with questionnaires, among clients, talking with people is important.28700:19:44,420 --> 00:19:49,170The clients include beneficiaries of the programme; men, women28800:19:49,374 --> 00:19:53,511youths, school children, teachers, community leaders28900:19:53,709 --> 00:19:56,385and members. Depending on the programme29000:19:56,653 --> 00:20:01,315formal surveys could include also health workers or even29100:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,729patent medicine dealers. Why not?29200:20:04,933 --> 00:20:08,545People have experiences and opinions to share29300:20:08,757 --> 00:20:13,182whether they are literate or not. People who use services of a programme29400:20:13,413 --> 00:20:17,913have views about what they like and what they do not like29500:20:18,101 --> 00:20:23,027about that programme. People who do not use services can29600:20:23,242 --> 00:20:28,155give us information about access problems or barriers.29700:20:28,440 --> 00:20:31,728Remember in Module 1 Professor Oladele Akogun and Dr Hans Remme29800:20:35,504 --> 00:20:40,079drew our attention to access to medicines and commodities29900:20:40,299 --> 00:20:43,536being an implementation problem.30000:20:43,794 --> 00:20:48,444Therefore listening to and documenting the experiences30100:20:48,659 --> 00:20:52,596and opinions of people is an appropriate data source30200:20:52,820 --> 00:20:55,582for diseases that affect the poor.30300:20:55,813 --> 00:21:00,576For example, through surveys and by documenting the experiences30400:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,480and opinions of beneficiaries of ivermectin drug distribution30500:21:04,694 --> 00:21:09,232programmes in 2 countries after 8 years of treatment30600:21:09,475 --> 00:21:16,538we learned that in communities being male, being above 24 years old30700:21:16,921 --> 00:21:21,458or belonging to a major ethnic group are factors associated with30800:21:21,659 --> 00:21:25,096better compliance to ivermectin treatment.30900:21:25,762 --> 00:21:30,349Another useful source of data is to observe programmes in action31000:21:30,575 --> 00:21:37,013in real life. For example, observations in service delivery points,31100:21:37,360 --> 00:21:40,260health worker performance checklists,31200:21:40,626 --> 00:21:44,088and availability of supplies and materials,31300:21:45,003 --> 00:21:50,528observations of the physical environment of the programme facility,31400:21:51,086 --> 00:21:53,512client turnout and comfort,31500:21:53,701 --> 00:21:56,989quality of record keeping, waiting time;31600:21:57,202 --> 00:22:01,639these are all important. In a 10 country study31700:22:01,841 --> 00:22:05,253end-users of health facilities, in particular, women31800:22:05,464 --> 00:22:09,977attending health clinics reported that attitude of health staff31900:22:10,190 --> 00:22:15,202and waiting time were their major concerns.32000:22:15,428 --> 00:22:20,091Checklists can be used by clinics and community health workers32100:22:20,300 --> 00:22:25,712for self-study, reflection and planning improvements.32200:22:25,955 --> 00:22:29,105So observing programmes is important.32300:22:29,476 --> 00:22:33,139I’lllike to end this chapter with reference to 2 other sources32400:22:33,350 --> 00:22:38,112of data that have proven very useful in implementation research.32500:22:38,344 --> 00:22:42,894These are observations in the community on health related32600:22:43,097 --> 00:22:48,660conditions, community level service delivery and observing32700:22:48,882 --> 00:22:51,857how people use interventions commodities such as32800:22:52,057 --> 00:22:54,219insecticide treated bed nets.32900:22:55,095 --> 00:22:58,432We can learn also from print and electronic media33000:22:58,817 --> 00:23:01,792about programme implementation bottlenecks,33100:23:02,007 --> 00:23:07,332gaps and successes. The press may not provide detailed statistics33200:23:07,613 --> 00:23:12,526but it does highlight issues of concerns to the community members33300:23:12,765 --> 00:23:16,252policy makers and programmemanagers.33400:23:16,792 --> 00:23:21,792This is another data source for implementation research.33500:23:22,015 --> 00:23:26,490Thank you and please join us to view the next chapter.
