00:00:22,451 --> 00:00:23,389
Hello.

2
00:00:23,568 --> 00:00:26,831
We have now reached the final
stage of the product value chain,

3
00:00:27,006 --> 00:00:29,068
that is use and support.

4
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:31,441
Since your goal is to achieve
sustainable impact,

5
00:00:31,613 --> 00:00:35,038
this phase is particularly crucial
to your overall mission,

6
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:37,153
as we will discuss.

7
00:00:38,002 --> 00:00:40,840
There is often a tendency
to think that once the product

8
00:00:41,006 --> 00:00:43,843
has been successfully
realized and delivered,

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,195
the job is done and dusted.

10
00:00:46,361 --> 00:00:49,236
However, we must remember that
the key objective for your product

11
00:00:49,404 --> 00:00:52,992
is to obtain sustainable impact,
which implies providing

12
00:00:53,165 --> 00:00:56,465
a continued and reliable supply
of intended benefits

13
00:00:56,637 --> 00:00:58,087
with your products.

14
00:00:58,291 --> 00:01:00,741
Therefore, this requires such
a product that is always functional,

15
00:01:00,911 --> 00:01:03,911
and for as long of
a period as possible. 

16
00:01:04,185 --> 00:01:07,272
This section discusses elements
related to putting your new product

17
00:01:07,458 --> 00:01:10,545
into use and providing it
with proper support,

18
00:01:10,709 --> 00:01:13,459
in order to ensure it's
long term viability

19
00:01:13,636 --> 00:01:15,886
and ultimately impact.

20
00:01:16,052 --> 00:01:23,164
And in this session we will discuss
commissioning, training

21
00:01:23,494 --> 00:01:29,607
maintenance, decommissioning,
and recycling.

22
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:31,719
The main objective of commissioning

23
00:01:31,896 --> 00:01:34,546
is to finally put
a new product into use.

24
00:01:34,715 --> 00:01:38,040
Depending on the type of product,
commissioning may also involve

25
00:01:38,204 --> 00:01:41,767
establishing and verifying
safety objectives, connecting it

26
00:01:41,922 --> 00:01:45,035
to the requisite utilities,
as well as the procurement

27
00:01:45,213 --> 00:01:47,463
of sufficient stocks
of material required

28
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,630
to put the product in full use.

29
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:53,099
It is very important though
that the documents relating

30
00:01:53,275 --> 00:01:56,375
to the commissioning
process be kept well.

31
00:01:56,649 --> 00:01:58,699
Another important issue
is the establishment

32
00:01:58,874 --> 00:02:01,299
of a user feedback mechanism.

33
00:02:01,898 --> 00:02:04,398
Presumably, you have done
as much as you can

34
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:07,770
to make sure that your product
is as user friendly as possible

35
00:02:08,178 --> 00:02:11,665
so it is important to verify
for every client, if possible,

36
00:02:11,838 --> 00:02:15,801
if they are indeed happy
or not with the "usability"
,

37
00:02:15,966 --> 00:02:18,941
ergonomic features
and other aspects related

38
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:21,257
to using the product properly.

39
00:02:21,451 --> 00:02:24,451
This could be achieved by
a simple questionnaire, for example 

40
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:28,623
but it would provide you invaluable
feedback of what is working well

41
00:02:28,794 --> 00:02:30,944
and what needs improvement.

42
00:02:31,165 --> 00:02:32,477
Commissioning is also the period

43
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,175
for finalizing how technical support
will be provided

44
00:02:35,343 --> 00:02:38,518
and who will carry it out and when.

45
00:02:38,777 --> 00:02:42,602
And we'll discuss this some more
in the coming slides.

46
00:02:42,882 --> 00:02:46,119
So overall, commissioning
requires appreciable planning

47
00:02:46,454 --> 00:02:49,454
and adequate resources
must be budgeted for.

48
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,083
Many problems are known to occur
during commissioning, in fact

49
00:02:53,254 --> 00:02:54,991
if it is not planned properly.

50
00:02:55,176 --> 00:02:57,076
And these problems
can seriously hamper

51
00:02:57,241 --> 00:03:00,291
the product from ever obtaining
proper functional levels

52
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:03,901
and frequently leads
to premature breakdown

53
00:03:04,077 --> 00:03:07,077
and use discontinuation.

54
00:03:07,336 --> 00:03:09,949
An extremely important point
is that the commissioning process

55
00:03:10,111 --> 00:03:12,848
must be accompanied
by a suitable training program

56
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:16,019
for potential operators and users.

57
00:03:16,348 --> 00:03:17,535
If you are based in regions that

58
00:03:17,702 --> 00:03:20,865
tend do have high
or frequent personnel turnover

59
00:03:21,049 --> 00:03:22,286
it would be prudent to train

60
00:03:22,454 --> 00:03:26,266
your needed critical personnel
in duplicate, for example.

61
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:29,956
Because the availability
of the suitable, qualified personnel

62
00:03:30,116 --> 00:03:31,979
at all times is fundamental

63
00:03:32,154 --> 00:03:35,054
to the long-term longevity
of the product

64
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:39,094
and it maybe necessary to recruit
new staff beforehand, if insufficient

65
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:42,249
on none available in-house.

66
00:03:42,526 --> 00:03:45,389
It is also likely that you
will not be in a position

67
00:03:45,581 --> 00:03:48,869
to set up your own after sales
infrastructure everywhere

68
00:03:49,034 --> 00:03:50,559
you'll be selling the product.

69
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:52,694
The common strategy used
by many businesses

70
00:03:52,866 --> 00:03:55,529
is to find already
existing local distributors,

71
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:59,387
who may also have the technicians
to support local needs

72
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,260
for repair and maintenance.

73
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:04,052
In that case,
you also have to design

74
00:04:04,225 --> 00:04:06,787
a suitable training program
for such strategic partners,

75
00:04:06,943 --> 00:04:09,893
in order to make sure they are
suitably equipped and must be

76
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:13,070
regularly updated with
new developments.

77
00:04:13,553 --> 00:04:17,016
Training can involve various formats,
depending on the complexity

78
00:04:17,185 --> 00:04:18,173
of the product.

79
00:04:18,351 --> 00:04:21,626
For example, it could be in the form
of a tutorial that is embedded

80
00:04:21,797 --> 00:04:24,884
in the equipment itself,
which could be regularly updated

81
00:04:25,065 --> 00:04:27,890
via internet links when new 

82
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:30,159
product developments or revision occur.

83
00:04:30,386 --> 00:04:36,624
Or it could be accompanied by actual workshops
at the client's premises,

84
00:04:36,842 --> 00:04:40,792
especially if your product
contains complex procedures.

85
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:44,099
Providing a workshop
also allows you to include

86
00:04:44,252 --> 00:04:46,065
all the background
or the theoretical information

87
00:04:46,227 --> 00:04:47,965
that maybe necessary to understand

88
00:04:48,128 --> 00:04:51,690
and optimally operate
the equipment.

89
00:04:52,229 --> 00:04:54,667
In our previous slide,
we emphasized the importance

90
00:04:54,843 --> 00:04:56,518
of properly commissioning
your new product

91
00:04:56,674 --> 00:05:01,011
in order to assure
it is put into full optimal use.

92
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,929
Unfortunately in many cases,
for as long as the product seems

93
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:06,857
to be running smoothly,
little or no care is given

94
00:05:07,021 --> 00:05:10,734
to routine and preventive
maintenance issues.

95
00:05:11,086 --> 00:05:14,473
How ever rugged and hardy you
may try and engineer your product,

96
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,847
it is a fact of life that
certain parts will

97
00:05:17,012 --> 00:05:20,762
experience wear and tear and
will need replacement eventually.

98
00:05:21,334 --> 00:05:24,072
If you are dealing with
complex instrumentation,

99
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:27,230
it may also require occasional
routine maintenance

100
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,480
such as re-calibration.

101
00:05:31,226 --> 00:05:34,138
Maintenance is crucial
to ensuring that your product

102
00:05:34,305 --> 00:05:36,792
continues to deliver
optimum performance,

103
00:05:37,028 --> 00:05:41,178
which is a key enabler towards
your desired impact.

104
00:05:41,972 --> 00:05:44,109
With devices, it will also ensure

105
00:05:44,278 --> 00:05:47,878
continued safety
of the product, for example.

106
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:51,921
Now, despite
it's obvious significance

107
00:05:52,624 --> 00:05:54,711
it is often neglected
in many developing countries

108
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:58,308
for reasons that have partially
been discussed in other lectures,

109
00:05:58,518 --> 00:06:02,968
such as the lack
of suitably skilled staff,

110
00:06:03,384 --> 00:06:06,384
cost of maintenance contracts, etc.

111
00:06:07,055 --> 00:06:11,016
It's no always that we think of
or can afford

112
00:06:11,216 --> 00:06:14,881
to negotiate a a maintenance contract
as soon as we get the device.

113
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:18,081
It can be delivered
with a minimal warranty

114
00:06:18,281 --> 00:06:22,116
that rarely goes
beyond the first year.

115
00:06:22,837 --> 00:06:26,236
After the first year, we become
dependent from the dealer

116
00:06:26,436 --> 00:06:29,175
that didn't leave a
technical documentation

117
00:06:29,375 --> 00:06:31,947
and holds us in case 
of a breakdown

118
00:06:32,147 --> 00:06:35,448
because we can only call him.
And as we're not under warranty

119
00:06:35,648 --> 00:06:37,644
he can apply his own conditions
before coming.

120
00:06:37,844 --> 00:06:41,588
Those are elements
that are troublesome

121
00:06:41,788 --> 00:06:44,788
in the devices commissioning chain.

122
00:06:45,123 --> 00:06:51,185
Those devices are handled
by private softwares

123
00:06:51,354 --> 00:06:52,439
So

124
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:54,504
if you're not
from Siemens,

125
00:06:54,843 --> 00:06:56,448
if you're not from Philips,

126
00:06:56,675 --> 00:06:59,221
if you're not
from General Electrics

127
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:04,718
you can't access the equipment.

128
00:07:04,984 --> 00:07:06,197
Even in case of breakdown.

129
00:07:06,779 --> 00:07:12,707
So you have to ask the salesman,
the service provider.

130
00:07:12,943 --> 00:07:15,740
You have to sign
a maintenance contract

131
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:20,535
but for this contract to work out

132
00:07:20,804 --> 00:07:22,711
the service provider
will need

133
00:07:22,961 --> 00:07:25,848
several reparation contracts

134
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:31,752
so it's interesting for him when
he has several equipments on one territory.

135
00:07:32,148 --> 00:07:33,944
And not one or two.

136
00:07:34,964 --> 00:07:36,398
And in this context

137
00:07:36,688 --> 00:07:44,142
we can imagine some sort of contract
or deal

138
00:07:44,318 --> 00:07:46,472
would be signed between
the service provider

139
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:48,023
and the Ministry of Health

140
00:07:48,208 --> 00:07:52,924
to resolve a certain number
of very simple breakdowns.

141
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:57,333
It's obvious that
for a certain level of breakdown

142
00:07:57,921 --> 00:08:01,401
you'll have to ask
for the expertise of the North.

143
00:08:02,205 --> 00:08:06,365
The training of a local engineer,
when there is one

144
00:08:07,191 --> 00:08:10,091
which is sometimes present
in the contract

145
00:08:10,679 --> 00:08:11,569
is not made...

146
00:08:11,814 --> 00:08:13,747
because normally the service provider

147
00:08:14,006 --> 00:08:16,837
when the contract was well negotiated
has to deliver the equipment

148
00:08:17,215 --> 00:08:20,027
and train somebody to its' maintenance.

149
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,902
Sometimes this is not done.

150
00:08:22,179 --> 00:08:26,833
It should be, I think, the supplier
who installs the equipment

151
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,023
who should train him
to recognize early signs

152
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,509
of frequent breakdowns.

153
00:08:33,031 --> 00:08:35,798
It isn't a very long
or complex training.

154
00:08:36,123 --> 00:08:38,625
It's just teaching us
to read code

155
00:08:38,891 --> 00:08:40,791
and when you see
this or that come up

156
00:08:40,977 --> 00:08:42,788
understand this or that problem
is going to happen.

157
00:08:42,985 --> 00:08:45,015
And call us,
it's that simple.

158
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:48,554
Now all of this discussion
highlights the important issue

159
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:50,090
I wish to re-emphasize

160
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,023
that is, when you are designing
your product do not think

161
00:08:53,193 --> 00:08:55,743
only about fulfilling
the intended function

162
00:08:55,909 --> 00:09:00,934
as the only criteria for success,
but also pay very close attention

163
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:03,460
and consideration
about how this product

164
00:09:03,635 --> 00:09:07,760
will maintained and repaired
and how you can make this process

165
00:09:07,926 --> 00:09:11,739
as simple and cost effective
as possible.

166
00:09:12,928 --> 00:09:15,366
For example, if it's
a device or equipment

167
00:09:15,538 --> 00:09:18,963
you may consider incorporating
remote monitoring features

168
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:24,154
via mobile telephony, for example,
that would collect pertinent data

169
00:09:24,319 --> 00:09:28,432
routinely from each and every one
of your devices out there,

170
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:32,209
which could potentially
be used to detect problems

171
00:09:32,388 --> 00:09:35,613
before they occur and eventually

172
00:09:35,771 --> 00:09:39,396
pre-empt and prevent total machine
breakdown and failure.

173
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:42,708
And even when the machine
requires to be repaired,

174
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:46,070
think hard and carefully
about how to make this process

175
00:09:46,232 --> 00:09:50,557
as simple as possible,
so that anyone can virtually do it,

176
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:53,674
such as using plug-and-play
strategies where you only need

177
00:09:53,837 --> 00:09:57,949
a minimum of tools,
such as a screwdriver.

178
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:02,631
Also, if possible, try and make sure
that most of the repairs

179
00:10:02,797 --> 00:10:04,710
that would be required
could be based

180
00:10:04,888 --> 00:10:07,888
on universally available parts.

181
00:10:09,243 --> 00:10:12,293
In fact, we can go as far
as saying that the issue

182
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:16,220
of simplifying maintenance
and repair can, in by itself,

183
00:10:16,391 --> 00:10:21,203
be a fertile hunting ground for new
innovations for developing markets.

184
00:10:21,372 --> 00:10:23,334
In other words,
for many existing products

185
00:10:23,498 --> 00:10:26,148
you may not need to develop
them from scratch,

186
00:10:26,323 --> 00:10:30,448
but can simply engineer features
that made them easier to maintain

187
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:34,569
and repair, even
in remote rural areas.

188
00:10:36,143 --> 00:10:39,043
Sooner or later your product
will reach the end of its life cycle

189
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,220
and will need to be rid off
or decommissioned.

190
00:10:42,526 --> 00:10:43,489
The term decommissioning

191
00:10:43,645 --> 00:10:45,820
is generally used
for major equipment.

192
00:10:46,091 --> 00:10:48,016
Manufacturing plants,
production lines

193
00:10:48,175 --> 00:10:50,025
or hazardous products.

194
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:53,146
Decommissioning is an important
part of the life cycle

195
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,861
of an equipment or installation,
but often receives insufficient

196
00:10:56,029 --> 00:10:58,441
attention during
the planning, budgeting

197
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:00,871
and operational phases
of the equipment. 

198
00:11:01,167 --> 00:11:03,455
This has lead to many unforeseen
issues and challenges

199
00:11:03,624 --> 00:11:06,987
when the products reaches
the end their economic life,

200
00:11:07,159 --> 00:11:10,796
because decommissioning can be
a complex multi-disciplinary process

201
00:11:10,972 --> 00:11:12,434
and it may require the management

202
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:14,120
of diverse issues
and the involvement

203
00:11:14,294 --> 00:11:16,131
of international
and government agencies

204
00:11:16,315 --> 00:11:19,315
 local communities and NGOs.

205
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,875
So make it a point to understand
the sectorial laws, regulations

206
00:11:24,036 --> 00:11:28,161
and guidelines applicable
to decommissioning your products

207
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:30,814
including any tax issues.

208
00:11:31,587 --> 00:11:35,175
In general, decommissioning is
the task of the client who owns

209
00:11:35,344 --> 00:11:37,432
their equipment,
but in many developing countries

210
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:40,608
waste management
and recycling is often a challenge

211
00:11:40,794 --> 00:11:43,007
and not carried out appropriately.

212
00:11:43,186 --> 00:11:45,898
So you may wish to consider
developing a suitable plan

213
00:11:46,078 --> 00:11:50,066
for the recovery or the recycling
of product material, and perhaps

214
00:11:50,232 --> 00:11:54,832
include it as the last step
of your after sales services.

215
00:11:55,418 --> 00:11:58,243
And the cost of this activity
could be integrated in your

216
00:11:58,419 --> 00:12:00,532
initial sales price in fact.

217
00:12:00,718 --> 00:12:02,255
This way you would be sure
that your products

218
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:03,765
does not end up contravening 

219
00:12:03,948 --> 00:12:06,198
some of the sustainable
development goals,

220
00:12:06,385 --> 00:12:09,823
which you sought to promote
with your innovation to begin with.

221
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:12,967
So overall, it is important
to design a product

222
00:12:13,137 --> 00:12:16,049
that simplifies this phase
as much as possible,

223
00:12:16,222 --> 00:12:19,247
such as avoiding
the use of toxic components

224
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:22,424
or difficult to recycle materials.

225
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:26,191
We hope that you have understood
the importance of this final step

226
00:12:26,362 --> 00:12:29,174
of use and support
and it's crucial contribution

227
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,865
towards attaining your sustainable
development objectives

228
00:12:32,028 --> 00:12:33,928
with your innovation.

229
00:12:34,178 --> 00:12:36,353
Furthermore, we hope you
have appreciated the significance

230
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:39,540
of taking a holistic approach
and looking at the total cost 

231
00:12:39,713 --> 00:12:42,713
of ownership to your customer
when thinking about your product.

232
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:45,366
Because the purchase
is only the first step,

233
00:12:45,573 --> 00:12:49,211
but if the other costs
are not factored in or considered

234
00:12:49,425 --> 00:12:53,275
your product may quickly become
a white elephant and be unable

235
00:12:53,442 --> 00:12:56,055
to achieve it's intended impact.

236
00:12:56,766 --> 00:12:59,116
This now brings us to
the end of the discussion

237
00:12:59,283 --> 00:13:01,870
of the product value
chain analysis tool.

238
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:06,868
I hope that you have appreciated
how important it is to consider

239
00:13:07,048 --> 00:13:12,586
all the steps, and the various steps
within each of the steps, in fact.

240
00:13:12,883 --> 00:13:16,133
And also the fact that innovation
may not only be needed

241
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:20,328
only at the R&D phase,
but there may be other innovation

242
00:13:20,503 --> 00:13:22,715
opportunities right through
the other sections

243
00:13:22,882 --> 00:13:24,907
of the product value chain.

244
00:13:25,113 --> 00:13:27,250
Goodbye.
