1
00:00:16,818 --> 00:00:17,905
Hello.

2
00:00:18,096 --> 00:00:20,646
In this video, we will continue
our journey through

3
00:00:20,833 --> 00:00:23,146
the product value chain tool.

4
00:00:23,346 --> 00:00:26,346
As for the other segments
of the chain, we will raise

5
00:00:26,546 --> 00:00:30,479
some strategically important topics,
which are especially relevant

6
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:32,574
to low and middle-income countries.

7
00:00:33,312 --> 00:00:36,668
We have already discussed issues
related to developing the product,

8
00:00:36,868 --> 00:00:39,256
to manufacturing and marketing it.

9
00:00:39,456 --> 00:00:43,196
Now we will look into
the distribution of our product.

10
00:00:44,746 --> 00:00:47,267
You may have heard
about the term "logistics".

11
00:00:47,467 --> 00:00:50,533
In industry,
logistics includes two main parts.

12
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:54,601
One is the upstream supply
of components and raw materials

13
00:00:54,801 --> 00:00:56,093
to the manufacturer,

14
00:00:56,293 --> 00:00:58,659
and the second is
the downstream transfer

15
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:00,904
of finished goods
from the manufacturer

16
00:01:01,104 --> 00:01:02,572
to the customer.

17
00:01:02,772 --> 00:01:05,177
In this video,
we will look especially

18
00:01:05,377 --> 00:01:08,572
at the second part,
which is called distribution.

19
00:01:08,772 --> 00:01:11,979
Distribution is the management
of the flow of goods

20
00:01:12,179 --> 00:01:15,381
between the manufacturer
and the point of consumptions or use

21
00:01:15,618 --> 00:01:17,155
by the customer.

22
00:01:17,355 --> 00:01:21,738
The product must be delivered
according to contract specifications

23
00:01:21,938 --> 00:01:24,596
in a perfect state, in due time,

24
00:01:24,796 --> 00:01:27,533
and at a cost
which has been optimized.

25
00:01:27,733 --> 00:01:31,249
In this chapter we will discuss
the following topics:

26
00:01:31,449 --> 00:01:34,449
Distributions channels.
Shipping.

27
00:01:34,649 --> 00:01:37,564
Packaging, which depends on
which shipping mode

28
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,536
has been selected.

29
00:01:39,736 --> 00:01:43,777
Third party logistics.
Customs, taxes and regulations.

30
00:01:43,977 --> 00:01:46,976
And finally, insurances
and Incoterms.

31
00:01:47,673 --> 00:01:50,259
The distribution of our technology
can be realized

32
00:01:50,459 --> 00:01:51,892
in many different ways.

33
00:01:52,092 --> 00:01:55,419
We will spend quite some time
in this video discussing

34
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,619
practical aspects related to
transporting the product,

35
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:01,819
and yet there are
some fundamental options

36
00:02:02,019 --> 00:02:04,073
we need to think about first.

37
00:02:04,273 --> 00:02:07,047
Think for example how you acquire
consumer goods,

38
00:02:07,247 --> 00:02:09,696
such as a tool for gardening.

39
00:02:09,896 --> 00:02:13,518
Such a tool would most probably
be manufactured somewhere

40
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:17,247
and then shipped in large quantities
to a wholesaler.

41
00:02:17,447 --> 00:02:21,907
The wholesaler would then
sell a batch to a retail shop

42
00:02:22,107 --> 00:02:25,665
located near your home,
where you will finally buy it.

43
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:28,865
As we can see there are
two intermediaries

44
00:02:29,065 --> 00:02:31,723
between the manufacturer
and the final customer.

45
00:02:31,923 --> 00:02:34,211
For your technology as well,

46
00:02:34,411 --> 00:02:36,830
we will need to decide
if you want to sell it

47
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,596
directly to your customer

48
00:02:38,796 --> 00:02:41,796
or if you prefer to involve
some reseller.

49
00:02:42,648 --> 00:02:45,100
There are many different options,
which all have

50
00:02:45,287 --> 00:02:47,969
their own advantages
and disadvantages.

51
00:02:48,169 --> 00:02:49,974
This is a complex subject.

52
00:02:50,174 --> 00:02:54,300
But I would like to give you
a general sense of the trade-offs.

53
00:02:54,512 --> 00:02:58,310
In our first option we decide
to find a partner

54
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:00,818
who will purchase from our company

55
00:03:01,018 --> 00:03:03,621
and then resell
to the final customer.

56
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:06,330
This partner could be
a local company,

57
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,156
which already has
a large customer base.

58
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,826
We can just benefit
from an existing access

59
00:03:12,014 --> 00:03:13,398
to the customers,

60
00:03:13,598 --> 00:03:16,598
which will expedite
the deployment of our technology.

61
00:03:17,858 --> 00:03:21,626
In that way, we would reach
large-scale much quicker.

62
00:03:22,958 --> 00:03:25,711
The downside is,
that the reseller will, of course,

63
00:03:25,911 --> 00:03:28,126
take a margin
from the sales revenues.

64
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:32,084
A second problem is that
there is a risk that we won't have

65
00:03:32,284 --> 00:03:34,492
any direct contact
with the customer.

66
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:37,959
This can prevent us
from being aware of issues

67
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,844
with customer satisfaction

68
00:03:40,044 --> 00:03:42,209
and from reacting
before it is too late,

69
00:03:42,409 --> 00:03:44,154
if there is a problem.

70
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:47,791
Also, we need to conduct
a very detailed analysis

71
00:03:47,991 --> 00:03:50,841
of our partner's reputation
and capabilities,

72
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:54,041
since this will be critical
for our success.

73
00:03:55,955 --> 00:03:58,882
In the second option
we decide to create

74
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:00,939
our own distribution channel.

75
00:04:01,139 --> 00:04:05,126
This will generally mean
that we can expect higher margins

76
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:08,095
as we don't have to pay
any intermediaries.

77
00:04:08,761 --> 00:04:12,069
We will also have the advantage
of a close proximity

78
00:04:12,269 --> 00:04:14,795
between our company
and the customers.

79
00:04:14,995 --> 00:04:17,708
One downside,
which can be quite serious,

80
00:04:17,908 --> 00:04:20,908
is that creating our own channels
is costly.

81
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:24,960
Creating a subsidiary can also mean
lots of lengthy legal

82
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,842
and administrative hassles
in certain countries.

83
00:04:28,042 --> 00:04:30,803
Remember our
ease of doing business index.

84
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:35,529
Also, it can be very complex
to manage from abroad.

85
00:04:35,729 --> 00:04:41,106
In general, companies opt for a mix
of owned and partnered channels,

86
00:04:41,306 --> 00:04:44,691
depending on the customer segments
and product sold.

87
00:04:44,891 --> 00:04:50,141
Getting this distribution mix right
is of crucial strategic importance.

88
00:04:51,053 --> 00:04:53,266
There is space for innovation here.

89
00:04:53,466 --> 00:04:56,330
For example, you may want to think
about direct sales

90
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:59,843
through the internet,
or even mobile systems.

91
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:03,142
Whichever way your customer
acquires your product

92
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:05,335
and unless your product is software,

93
00:05:05,535 --> 00:05:08,110
the next issue you will then
have to solve is

94
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,213
how your product will be
physically shipped to the customer.

95
00:05:13,156 --> 00:05:17,177
Fundamentally, the first question
we need to ask ourselves is

96
00:05:17,377 --> 00:05:20,674
how we will transport our products
from the site of manufacturing

97
00:05:20,874 --> 00:05:22,151
to the customer.

98
00:05:22,351 --> 00:05:25,034
This mainly depends
on three key questions.

99
00:05:25,234 --> 00:05:28,693
The first is, what is the product
that we want to ship?

100
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:31,548
It is important to know
the product well, obviously.

101
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,881
Since this will determine
the conditions

102
00:05:34,081 --> 00:05:35,973
for the shipping and handling.

103
00:05:36,173 --> 00:05:38,750
For example,
if the product is a vaccine

104
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:40,777
it requires a "cold chain".

105
00:05:41,656 --> 00:05:44,153
We need to know
the components of the product,

106
00:05:44,353 --> 00:05:48,377
as some of them may have to comply
with specific regulations.

107
00:05:48,577 --> 00:05:51,577
For example,
if a lithium battery is involved,

108
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,647
which can catch fire.

109
00:05:54,612 --> 00:05:57,612
Depending on the product
and specific market

110
00:05:57,812 --> 00:05:59,876
this will also determine
the lead time

111
00:06:00,076 --> 00:06:01,487
and the costs involved.

112
00:06:01,687 --> 00:06:04,687
These elements are, of course,
very dependent

113
00:06:04,887 --> 00:06:06,497
on the transport mode.

114
00:06:06,697 --> 00:06:10,349
For example, if we decide
to ship our product by air,

115
00:06:10,549 --> 00:06:11,878
which is very costly,

116
00:06:12,078 --> 00:06:14,160
it may take two or three days,

117
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,360
as compared to weeks
if we use the cheaper option

118
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,243
of maritime transport.

119
00:06:19,443 --> 00:06:23,505
The second questions is
what is the point of origin

120
00:06:23,705 --> 00:06:24,923
of the product?

121
00:06:25,123 --> 00:06:28,560
Sometimes the product
is completely manufactured

122
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,760
in some specific location
and shipped to the customer.

123
00:06:32,173 --> 00:06:35,594
But more often the cost
can be optimized

124
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:39,380
if the final product is assembled
close to the customer.

125
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:43,156
For example,
when the product involves heavy

126
00:06:43,356 --> 00:06:47,150
or cumbersome components
which can be locally manufactured.

127
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:52,678
It is also important to consider
that there may be instances

128
00:06:52,878 --> 00:06:57,265
where we need to keep some inventory
of semi-finished or finished goods,

129
00:06:57,465 --> 00:07:01,845
as this can counterbalance
fluctuations in demand

130
00:07:02,045 --> 00:07:05,045
or geopolitical instabilities.

131
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:09,418
The third questions is,
who is the recipient?

132
00:07:09,618 --> 00:07:13,454
This question goes back
to the sales strategy.

133
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:18,530
It could be that we try
to sell directly to individuals,

134
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,730
or we might sell to intermediaries,

135
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:23,985
who will then
further deploy the product

136
00:07:24,185 --> 00:07:25,768
to the final customer.

137
00:07:25,968 --> 00:07:28,796
Here as well there are
quite a few possibilities

138
00:07:28,996 --> 00:07:33,479
to optimize our shipping strategy
for cost, quality and lead time.

139
00:07:34,538 --> 00:07:37,538
In general, shipping involves
lots of aspects,

140
00:07:37,738 --> 00:07:41,536
which will ideally be handled
by someone who has the experience

141
00:07:41,736 --> 00:07:43,847
in the specific country.

142
00:07:45,077 --> 00:07:47,785
It is always interesting
to work close

143
00:07:47,985 --> 00:07:52,058
to an internationally recognized
hub, where lots of goods are

144
00:07:52,258 --> 00:07:53,830
in transit as a start.

145
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:57,377
This will tend to reduce unknowns
in terms of paperwork

146
00:07:57,577 --> 00:07:58,846
and regulation.

147
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:02,929
As we consider the global
shipping strategy for our product,

148
00:08:03,129 --> 00:08:06,732
we also need to hedge
for some specific risks,

149
00:08:06,932 --> 00:08:09,932
such as fluctuations
in freight costs,

150
00:08:10,132 --> 00:08:14,211
geopolitical problems or variations
in currency exchange rates,

151
00:08:14,411 --> 00:08:16,397
which can be a game-stopper.

152
00:08:17,629 --> 00:08:19,923
We need to think about alternatives

153
00:08:20,123 --> 00:08:23,257
and create back-plans
right from the start.

154
00:08:24,158 --> 00:08:25,975
As we want to ship our product

155
00:08:26,175 --> 00:08:29,664
we will obviously need
to protect it during the transfers.

156
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:34,437
The first role of packaging is
to provide sufficient protection

157
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:38,430
for the goods during
transportation and handling.

158
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:42,718
As we usually do not know
the shipping mode in advance

159
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:46,155
there are several layers
of packaging involved.

160
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:50,495
The primary packaging,
which directly contains the products,

161
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:53,695
will provide an individual
general protection.

162
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,533
Then, the separate
primary unit packs

163
00:08:57,733 --> 00:09:01,269
will often be grouped together
in secondary packages

164
00:09:01,469 --> 00:09:02,919
for transport.

165
00:09:03,119 --> 00:09:06,947
These secondary packages
might then be placed on a pallet

166
00:09:07,147 --> 00:09:10,757
for easy handling
prior to being put into a container,

167
00:09:10,957 --> 00:09:13,729
which would be our tertiary package.

168
00:09:14,752 --> 00:09:18,734
These second and third levels
of packaging will strongly depend

169
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,421
on the shipping mode.

170
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:23,621
For fragile products
we may need to define

171
00:09:23,821 --> 00:09:26,493
maximum acceptable temperature,

172
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:29,749
humidity, vibration and shock loads.

173
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:33,965
These transport specifications
will help us design

174
00:09:34,165 --> 00:09:37,165
adequate packaging,
which will be adapted

175
00:09:37,365 --> 00:09:40,365
to the corresponding
optimized shipping mode.

176
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:44,799
We need to take
these parameters into account

177
00:09:44,999 --> 00:09:48,222
as early as when we are
designing product,

178
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:52,525
because the overall cost
of the product

179
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:56,364
may be largely influenced
by transport costs.

180
00:09:57,648 --> 00:10:02,216
It may also happen that even
a slight modification to the product

181
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:06,635
and to its packaging can have
a great influence on these costs.

182
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:10,359
As said before,
we also need to be aware

183
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:12,101
that some products

184
00:10:12,281 --> 00:10:15,648
like chemicals, liquids, explosives,

185
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,830
biohazardous goods,

186
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,713
need to comply with special
standards and regulations.

187
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:25,916
They may require specific packaging
and handling processes,

188
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:29,802
which depend on the shipping mode
and the country.

189
00:10:31,084 --> 00:10:34,953
The packaging will also need
to carry mandatory information,

190
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:38,799
including labeling,
regulatory compliance markings

191
00:10:38,999 --> 00:10:41,153
such as de CE mark in Europe,

192
00:10:41,353 --> 00:10:44,353
as well as
the traceability references.

193
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:49,407
Traceability means that we need
to be able to know exactly how,

194
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:53,340
when and by whom
the product was transported

195
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,624
and finally received.

196
00:10:55,824 --> 00:10:59,809
This is mandatory for many goods
such as medical devices,

197
00:11:00,009 --> 00:11:03,009
pharmaceuticals, food and so forth.

198
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,079
International shipping is
such a highly specialized activity

199
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,693
that most suppliers
and even large companies

200
00:11:09,893 --> 00:11:11,930
prefer to subcontract
these activities

201
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,018
to third-party experts.

202
00:11:14,190 --> 00:11:16,991
The third-party shipping companies
are generally divided

203
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:18,491
into two types.

204
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:21,863
First, those specialized
in single pack shipments.

205
00:11:22,376 --> 00:11:27,137
These well-known global companies,
such as UPS, FedEx or DHL,

206
00:11:27,337 --> 00:11:30,889
are specialized in shipping single
and low-weight boxes

207
00:11:31,089 --> 00:11:34,089
or envelopes to private consumers
and businesses.

208
00:11:34,289 --> 00:11:37,296
They are efficient and provide
simple, all-inclusive,

209
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:39,914
quick and reliable
point-to-point logistics.

210
00:11:40,114 --> 00:11:44,056
These companies also operate
their own means of transportation

211
00:11:44,256 --> 00:11:46,939
like aircraft and trucks.

212
00:11:47,139 --> 00:11:50,060
However, their price
per unit of weight and volume

213
00:11:50,248 --> 00:11:51,491
is high.

214
00:11:51,691 --> 00:11:55,708
Second, there are those specialized
in freight forwarding.

215
00:11:55,908 --> 00:11:58,139
The freight forwarding companies
are  less known

216
00:11:58,339 --> 00:12:00,646
to the general public,
as they work mainly

217
00:12:00,846 --> 00:12:02,931
in the business to business markets.

218
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:06,718
Usually, freight forwarders
do not move the goods themselves,

219
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:09,653
but they work with carriers
for the transportations

220
00:12:09,853 --> 00:12:12,412
and customs brokers
for the customs clearances.

221
00:12:12,612 --> 00:12:15,433
They usually handle larger
and heavier loads.

222
00:12:15,633 --> 00:12:18,234
For instance, they can handle
a whole container

223
00:12:18,434 --> 00:12:20,303
from the factory to the customer.

224
00:12:20,503 --> 00:12:23,728
The price per unit of weight
can be surprisingly low.

225
00:12:23,928 --> 00:12:27,582
They are one of the pillars
of the global world economy,

226
00:12:27,782 --> 00:12:30,998
as they move goods
around the world at a low cost.

227
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,638
The differentiation
between those two types

228
00:12:34,838 --> 00:12:37,838
of third-party companies
tends to dissapear nowadays

229
00:12:38,038 --> 00:12:40,920
as the single-pack
shipping companies have entered

230
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,676
the freight forwarding business
and freight forwarders

231
00:12:43,876 --> 00:12:46,071
are also getting more diversified.

232
00:12:46,271 --> 00:12:49,754
Logistics companies
in developing countries

233
00:12:49,954 --> 00:12:53,467
are not very different from
their industrialized counterparts

234
00:12:53,667 --> 00:12:55,224
with regards to performance.

235
00:12:55,424 --> 00:12:57,615
However, they tend to be
more fragmented

236
00:12:57,815 --> 00:12:59,244
in developing countries.

237
00:12:59,444 --> 00:13:02,120
Some companies may specialize
in  a particular region

238
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,886
or transport mode,

239
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:06,859
some others will specialize
in customs clearance

240
00:13:07,059 --> 00:13:10,270
in a specific country,
while others won't.

241
00:13:10,938 --> 00:13:12,983
In difficult regions of the world,

242
00:13:13,183 --> 00:13:16,183
a third-party shipping partner is
absolutely crucial

243
00:13:16,383 --> 00:13:20,007
for a successful distribution,
and this needs to be carefully chosen.

244
00:13:20,986 --> 00:13:23,986
Customs remain a major burden
in many parts of the world,

245
00:13:24,186 --> 00:13:27,186
as they will increase costs
and lead times.

246
00:13:28,027 --> 00:13:30,803
International tariff headings
have been defined

247
00:13:31,003 --> 00:13:34,446
to differentiate all kinds of goods
that can be traded.

248
00:13:34,646 --> 00:13:37,646
Specific products might be subject

249
00:13:37,846 --> 00:13:42,125
to very different customs duties
depending on its tariff heading

250
00:13:42,325 --> 00:13:43,939
and country of origin.

251
00:13:44,344 --> 00:13:48,162
This is a tricky and complex topic
and customs regulations are

252
00:13:48,362 --> 00:13:52,041
specific to each country
and might be subject to exceptions,

253
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:55,000
special cases and modifications.

254
00:13:55,819 --> 00:13:59,257
For example, some countries
have decided not to tax

255
00:13:59,457 --> 00:14:03,838
import of medical goods
in an effort to facilitating access.

256
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,790
As we think about
which country to work with,

257
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,608
customs duties and regulations
may have a great influence

258
00:14:11,808 --> 00:14:13,709
on our industrial strategy.

259
00:14:13,909 --> 00:14:18,606
For instance, many countries
would not tax half-finished products

260
00:14:18,806 --> 00:14:20,960
as much as finished goods.

261
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,957
Therefore, a good strategy might be
to consider importing

262
00:14:25,157 --> 00:14:28,157
semi-finished goods,
which will then be assembled

263
00:14:28,357 --> 00:14:31,140
in the country to avoid high taxes.

264
00:14:31,902 --> 00:14:36,047
In addition to taxation issues,
customs are also responsible

265
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:40,260
to check that the product complies
with the local legislation

266
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:42,506
and require certifications.

267
00:14:43,068 --> 00:14:47,080
This can become very troublesome
as customs officers are not

268
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:50,519
specialists in all local regulations
for all types of products.

269
00:14:50,719 --> 00:14:54,178
So, we might get our product
stuck at the customs

270
00:14:54,378 --> 00:14:56,412
because of a missing document,

271
00:14:56,612 --> 00:15:00,051
whether it is
really mandatory to have it or not.

272
00:15:00,724 --> 00:15:04,144
Unfortunately, we might say,
customs officers can have

273
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:06,919
significant power,
as they can decide

274
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:10,119
to block goods of high value
at customs.

275
00:15:11,138 --> 00:15:14,138
In some countries
corrupt customs officers

276
00:15:14,338 --> 00:15:17,338
will use this opportunity
to request bribes.

277
00:15:18,656 --> 00:15:21,349
On top of the customs duties,

278
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:25,837
the customer will have to pay
the value-added tax or VAT

279
00:15:26,037 --> 00:15:28,519
to the local tax authorities.

280
00:15:29,113 --> 00:15:33,029
Most of the countries in the world
apply this consumption tax

281
00:15:33,229 --> 00:15:37,144
on products and services regardless
of the product's origin.

282
00:15:38,938 --> 00:15:41,728
As you certainly know
there are all sorts

283
00:15:41,928 --> 00:15:44,394
of economic agreements
between countries

284
00:15:44,589 --> 00:15:46,880
and entire regions or continents,

285
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:51,162
which define the rules that apply
to the trade of goods.

286
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:56,049
Amongst the most important ones,
we will find free-trade areas,

287
00:15:56,249 --> 00:15:59,249
customs unions, common markets

288
00:15:59,449 --> 00:16:02,079
and economic unions, etcetera.

289
00:16:03,239 --> 00:16:05,964
These different forms of cooperation

290
00:16:06,139 --> 00:16:09,017
tend to define the level
of the trade barriers

291
00:16:09,217 --> 00:16:12,217
that exist between
concerned countries,

292
00:16:13,288 --> 00:16:16,420
Trade barriers can come
in multiple forms.

293
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,402
which can be based on tariffs,

294
00:16:19,602 --> 00:16:22,602
which are import or export taxes,

295
00:16:22,802 --> 00:16:24,553
or non-tariffs.

296
00:16:24,753 --> 00:16:27,753
Non-tariff trade barriers can be,
for example,

297
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:32,060
import quotas, subsidies,
customs delays,

298
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:36,853
technical barriers or other systems
preventing or impeding trade.

299
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:40,466
In Central Africa, for example,

300
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:44,942
there is the Economic and Monetary
Community of Central Africa

301
00:16:45,142 --> 00:16:49,521
or CEMAC, which is the customs
and monetary union.

302
00:16:50,075 --> 00:16:52,509
In Southern Africa there is

303
00:16:52,709 --> 00:16:56,278
the Southern African Development
Community or SADC,

304
00:16:56,478 --> 00:16:58,147
which is a free-trade area.

305
00:16:58,644 --> 00:17:01,709
The trade of goods within
a free-trade agreement region

306
00:17:01,909 --> 00:17:04,743
will be subject to limited,
and sometimes,

307
00:17:04,943 --> 00:17:07,269
even zero customs duties.

308
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:12,093
It is certainly wise to carefully
look into those issues,

309
00:17:12,293 --> 00:17:15,696
as we develop our technology
and business model.

310
00:17:16,422 --> 00:17:19,199
This is yet another reason
why we need to consider

311
00:17:19,399 --> 00:17:23,005
involving some expert,
who is used to handling

312
00:17:23,205 --> 00:17:26,205
customs issues in the country
we are considering.

313
00:17:26,909 --> 00:17:29,597
Let us now listen
to a customs officer

314
00:17:29,797 --> 00:17:31,226
in Douala, Cameroon,

315
00:17:31,426 --> 00:17:34,837
who discusses these questions
from his perspective.

316
00:17:35,658 --> 00:17:37,928
An extended delay to process goods
at the customs

317
00:17:38,947 --> 00:17:40,870
can be due to several issues.

318
00:17:42,142 --> 00:17:44,946
Let's not forget that,
at the port area level,

319
00:17:45,317 --> 00:17:47,941
several parties take part
in the process.

320
00:17:48,284 --> 00:17:50,496
There is, indeed, the customs bureau,

321
00:17:51,188 --> 00:17:52,569
the consignee,

322
00:17:52,814 --> 00:17:53,968
the stevedore,

323
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:56,934
the port authority...

324
00:17:57,685 --> 00:18:00,549
There are also other units,
such a the health department,

325
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:05,049
in the case of medical equipment,

326
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,198
There are plenty of services involved.

327
00:18:08,961 --> 00:18:09,994
And sometimes,

328
00:18:12,027 --> 00:18:15,866
the service that matters is not well informed
of the procedures.

329
00:18:17,189 --> 00:18:18,907
It could be preliminary procedures,

330
00:18:19,590 --> 00:18:21,191
for example,
at the Ministry of Health,

331
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:23,720
where it might be required
to ask for an authorization,

332
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:28,188
or it could be afterwards,
dealing with port area parties,

333
00:18:28,388 --> 00:18:31,392
because sometimes procedures
must be anticipated before shipping.

334
00:18:31,811 --> 00:18:34,313
<i>Sometimes, people are not aware
of the procedures</i>

335
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,573
<i>and if you'd like the procedures to last
as little as possible,</i>

336
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:41,608
<i>you should start the procedure
before the ship arrival,</i>

337
00:18:42,716 --> 00:18:44,595
<i>with the assistance of a professional,</i>

338
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:46,391
<i>and starting at the right time,</i>

339
00:18:47,484 --> 00:18:50,484
issuing all necessary documents
beforehand,

340
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:53,927
and that these documents
are very well prepared.

341
00:18:56,453 --> 00:18:59,166
If you go

342
00:19:00,149 --> 00:19:02,819
through all these steps,

343
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,893
you'll ensure that customs procedures
will be done within deadlines.

344
00:19:06,953 --> 00:19:11,546
It is easy to imagine that goods
might suffer from damages or lost

345
00:19:11,746 --> 00:19:13,814
along the whole logistics process.

346
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:16,873
Although it is not compulsory,
it is highly recommended

347
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:20,414
to look into ensuring the goods
during distribution paths.

348
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:25,340
Since casualties are relatively low
in comparison to the huge amount

349
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:27,060
of goods transported,

350
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:30,684
the cost of insurance is
relatively low as well.

351
00:19:31,287 --> 00:19:35,113
Most of the time it is much less
than one percent of the goods value

352
00:19:35,313 --> 00:19:39,237
but the premium will depend
on the level of risk estimated

353
00:19:39,412 --> 00:19:41,383
by the insurance company.

354
00:19:42,205 --> 00:19:45,364
International commercial terms
or Incoterms

355
00:19:45,564 --> 00:19:48,398
are a series of predefined
commercial terms

356
00:19:48,598 --> 00:19:53,031
that clearly define the obligations,
costs and risks involved

357
00:19:53,231 --> 00:19:56,493
in the delivery of goods
from the seller to the buyer.

358
00:19:57,357 --> 00:19:59,545
For instance, Ex Works,

359
00:19:59,745 --> 00:20:02,745
which is abbreviated EXW

360
00:20:02,945 --> 00:20:05,748
with the name
of the place of delivery attached

361
00:20:05,948 --> 00:20:08,948
means that the seller
will make the goods available

362
00:20:09,148 --> 00:20:10,867
in his own premises.

363
00:20:11,067 --> 00:20:13,859
It is up to the customer
to pick them up there

364
00:20:14,059 --> 00:20:16,800
and to take care of the whole
transportation process,

365
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:20,495
including insurance,
taxes, customs, etcetera.

366
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:24,908
At the other end of the spectrum,
we have so the called

367
00:20:25,108 --> 00:20:28,694
Delivery Duty Paid
or DDP,

368
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,634
which means that it is the seller
who will organize and pay

369
00:20:32,834 --> 00:20:36,005
for the delivery of the goods
to the customer.

370
00:20:36,205 --> 00:20:39,205
There are many variants
in-between those two cases,

371
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:43,314
which places more or less obligation
on either the buyer's

372
00:20:43,514 --> 00:20:45,263
or the seller's side.

373
00:20:45,463 --> 00:20:48,681
It is highly advisable
to be aware of these aspects,

374
00:20:48,881 --> 00:20:51,881
as they may have
important consequences

375
00:20:52,081 --> 00:20:54,503
on risk, cost and lead times.

376
00:20:55,350 --> 00:20:57,774
Finally, if you have
a software product

377
00:20:57,974 --> 00:20:59,959
things will look quite different

378
00:21:00,134 --> 00:21:02,434
since your product
does not have to be

379
00:21:02,634 --> 00:21:05,717
physically packaged
and shipped in a container.

380
00:21:06,719 --> 00:21:08,401
However, asking yourself,

381
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,142
how the software will be made
available to the customer

382
00:21:11,342 --> 00:21:13,091
remains a central question.

383
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,563
It will probably involve
regulatory aspects,

384
00:21:15,763 --> 00:21:18,771
which are specific to each domain.

385
00:21:18,971 --> 00:21:22,603
For example,
patient data privacy protection

386
00:21:22,803 --> 00:21:25,947
is a very important topic
in the field of medical software.

387
00:21:26,147 --> 00:21:29,084
Of course,
there is much more to be said

388
00:21:29,284 --> 00:21:30,991
on the topic of distribution.

389
00:21:31,191 --> 00:21:33,375
However, we believe
that we have touched on

390
00:21:33,575 --> 00:21:35,313
the most important aspects.

391
00:21:35,513 --> 00:21:39,060
I think we have convinced you
that it is highly advisable

392
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,837
to start discussion on the subject
with knowledgeable people

393
00:21:43,037 --> 00:21:44,723
early on in the process.

394
00:21:44,923 --> 00:21:46,331
Goodbye.
