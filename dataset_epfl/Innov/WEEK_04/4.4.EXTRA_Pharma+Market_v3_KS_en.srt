1
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:16,195
You must know that we 
are in a rural zone.

2
00:00:16,797 --> 00:00:18,011
It's true,

3
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:19,910
we are not very far from Yaoundé.

4
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,933
Between 55 and 65 miles, 
less than 65 miles.

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,383
But it is actually 
mainly a rural zone

6
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,800
where people mainly live off

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,913
subsistence crops

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:35,028
so they mainly live off agriculture.

9
00:00:34,111 --> 00:00:37,111


10
00:00:35,228 --> 00:00:37,142
There are subsistence crops,

11
00:00:37,342 --> 00:00:38,673
cash crop cultivation,

12
00:00:38,873 --> 00:00:40,855
mostly cacao.

13
00:00:41,193 --> 00:00:43,877
Which means for cacao

14
00:00:44,567 --> 00:00:48,055
the harvest is one 
period of the year

15
00:00:48,243 --> 00:00:49,228
a certain period,

16
00:00:49,428 --> 00:00:52,413
from let's say September,

17
00:00:52,613 --> 00:00:56,558
till march of the next year.

18
00:00:57,165 --> 00:01:00,033
So at that moment,

19
00:01:00,233 --> 00:01:03,737
visitor levels are at their highest,

20
00:01:03,937 --> 00:01:05,501
meaning people come

21
00:01:05,701 --> 00:01:07,610
more often to the hospital,

22
00:01:07,137 --> 00:01:10,137


23
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,749
because at the 
moment with the cash crops

24
00:01:10,949 --> 00:01:13,859
it means they have more money,

25
00:01:14,742 --> 00:01:17,734
they'll come more 
willingly to the hospital

26
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:19,762
it's easier for them

27
00:01:19,962 --> 00:01:21,083
because now

28
00:01:21,283 --> 00:01:23,226
they can really
pay for their treatments

29
00:01:25,075 --> 00:01:26,601
and this period

30
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:27,617
we could say,

31
00:01:27,817 --> 00:01:30,103
we could consider it also

32
00:01:30,303 --> 00:01:32,364
in health terms,

33
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:35,789
as the high hospital attendance period,

34
00:01:35,989 --> 00:01:37,545
from November to December

35
00:01:38,282 --> 00:01:39,503
November to December roughly,

36
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:42,426
then, it goes down bit by bit,

37
00:01:42,626 --> 00:01:45,180
until March,

38
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,152
after March,

39
00:01:47,352 --> 00:01:48,729
the attendance falls.

40
00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,337
In our countries

41
00:01:59,537 --> 00:02:01,450
it is hard to use

42
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,605
modern medecine

43
00:02:03,805 --> 00:02:04,655
because it is expensive

44
00:02:04,855 --> 00:02:07,570
and we don't have a 
social security system

45
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,555
the patient pays for everything

46
00:02:11,755 --> 00:02:16,374
and sometimes, 
there are a lot of exams

47
00:02:16,574 --> 00:02:20,393
that a patient would need

48
00:02:20,593 --> 00:02:22,945
but because of their small income

49
00:02:23,145 --> 00:02:24,477
they cannot do them.

50
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,211
So we try

51
00:02:28,464 --> 00:02:30,620
to use our intelligence

52
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:32,696
to make an early diagnosis

53
00:02:32,896 --> 00:02:37,009
and not always a clinical diagnosis

54
00:02:37,209 --> 00:02:39,511
because the living standard

55
00:02:39,711 --> 00:02:41,049
the buying power,

56
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:42,870
doesn't allow it.

57
00:02:46,443 --> 00:02:50,419
Ad Lucem was created
for the poorer population

58
00:02:51,253 --> 00:02:52,883
but between you and me,

59
00:02:53,567 --> 00:02:55,597
you cannot

60
00:02:55,797 --> 00:02:57,591
give good quality care

61
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,819
and even medication for free

62
00:03:00,019 --> 00:03:02,844
so there is a small fee

63
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:05,487
that the patient must pay

64
00:03:05,687 --> 00:03:07,228
for it to work.

65
00:03:08,334 --> 00:03:11,364
So the poverty problem

66
00:03:11,564 --> 00:03:14,425
means we often treat ill people

67
00:03:15,664 --> 00:03:16,752
that don't have money

68
00:03:16,952 --> 00:03:21,726
and that causes problems
for our financial management

69
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:23,085
because the hospital

70
00:03:23,908 --> 00:03:27,653
finds it difficult to 
get the money elsewhere

71
00:03:27,853 --> 00:03:30,133
for the debt created by
these ill people

72
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,094
so sometimes,

73
00:03:32,294 --> 00:03:34,916
we have to play a social role,

74
00:03:35,116 --> 00:03:37,712
if you owe us 100,000

75
00:03:37,912 --> 00:03:40,874
and you come in for 
an emergency cesarian

76
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:41,939
we will operate on you,

77
00:03:42,139 --> 00:03:43,574
and after the operation

78
00:03:43,774 --> 00:03:45,438
when it amounts to 100'000

79
00:03:45,638 --> 00:03:47,805
but you can't even pay 50'000

80
00:03:48,005 --> 00:03:50,198
and you stay 1 month

81
00:03:50,398 --> 00:03:52,882
sometimes two months, 
even three in the hospital

82
00:03:53,082 --> 00:03:56,070
stuck because of this 50'000 debt

83
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,779
and we have to help these people

84
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:01,175
sometimes we treat people
and just let them go.

85
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:04,060
So that creates a hole

86
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,485
in our budget

87
00:04:10,910 --> 00:04:16,279
and there, without
the public grants

88
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:18,007
given by the government,

89
00:04:19,039 --> 00:04:22,217
a lot is given by 
the general direction

90
00:04:22,417 --> 00:04:25,559
for our service mode,

91
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,948
we couldn't even function.

92
00:04:30,952 --> 00:04:32,502
You would have to understand

93
00:04:32,702 --> 00:04:33,652
that we must manage

94
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:37,543
the patients wallet,

95
00:04:37,743 --> 00:04:41,108
what I mean by that is

96
00:04:41,308 --> 00:04:43,606
his financial capacity,

97
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:46,806


98
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:45,790
you need to be able to control that.

99
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:50,207
You can't prescribe and exam

100
00:04:50,407 --> 00:04:52,490
and send him or
her straight to Yaoundé

101
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:55,488
because they feel like 
we are trying to get rid of them

102
00:04:55,688 --> 00:04:57,290
and that, at least they know

103
00:04:57,490 --> 00:05:00,930
that at Yaoundé
the cost will be huge.

104
00:05:01,323 --> 00:05:03,240
When I try to
look at the anatomy

105
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,207
of the human body,

106
00:05:05,407 --> 00:05:05,937
the way,

107
00:05:06,737 --> 00:05:11,321
Lorie, she has slightly 
dislocated her knee

108
00:05:11,521 --> 00:05:12,963
the knee goes inward,

109
00:05:13,787 --> 00:05:15,658
so when she walks

110
00:05:15,931 --> 00:05:17,546
the foot is deformed

111
00:05:18,931 --> 00:05:19,872
it is deformed

112
00:05:20,072 --> 00:05:22,802
and you can see the deformity

113
00:05:23,002 --> 00:05:24,252
when she walks.

114
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:26,896
That's it.

115
00:05:27,096 --> 00:05:28,862
And it from a lack of means,

116
00:05:29,062 --> 00:05:32,184
I could not possibly
take her to Yaoundé

117
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:33,661
to do the x-ray.

118
00:05:34,376 --> 00:05:35,265
The other challenge,

119
00:05:35,465 --> 00:05:38,155
is everything that has to do with

120
00:05:38,355 --> 00:05:39,992
the financial side of healthcare

121
00:05:40,192 --> 00:05:42,197
because unfortunately in Cameroon,

122
00:05:42,397 --> 00:05:45,109
households still suffer

123
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:46,918
from the cost of healthcare

124
00:05:47,118 --> 00:05:48,955
and that really is something of

125
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:51,577
an important challenge 
for the government,

126
00:05:51,777 --> 00:05:53,465
to be able to put into place

127
00:05:53,665 --> 00:05:55,159
a solidary system

128
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:56,400
and insurance system

129
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,061
to finally allow

130
00:05:59,261 --> 00:06:00,236
that all

131
00:06:00,436 --> 00:06:02,059
can have access to health treatments

132
00:06:02,259 --> 00:06:03,953
without paying a lot.

133
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:05,461


134
00:06:06,275 --> 00:06:07,217
In Cameroon,

135
00:06:07,417 --> 00:06:09,293
the price of health services

136
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:13,878
is in fact lower than the actual cost

137
00:06:14,078 --> 00:06:17,626
which would be needed for the equipment,

138
00:06:18,225 --> 00:06:20,066
that is the first fact.

139
00:06:20,647 --> 00:06:22,038
The second fact,

140
00:06:22,238 --> 00:06:24,528
when you buy a scanner,

141
00:06:27,024 --> 00:06:27,846
well,

142
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:33,609
the scanners are very 
high tech pieces of equipment

143
00:06:33,809 --> 00:06:37,470
that need to work optimally,

144
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:40,118
meaning they must do exams

145
00:06:40,318 --> 00:06:41,339
every single day

146
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:42,910
constantly,

147
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:46,801
you must do 20,30,40 scans a day

148
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:49,039


149
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:49,836
to hope to be able to
make it cost-effective

150
00:06:50,036 --> 00:06:53,031
after five years in use

151
00:06:53,231 --> 00:06:54,785
and that is not the case

152
00:06:54,985 --> 00:06:57,276
in our countries

153
00:06:57,476 --> 00:07:01,414
because the access to
these treatments

154
00:07:01,614 --> 00:07:04,710
is still too expensive

155
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:06,538
for the population

156
00:07:06,738 --> 00:07:09,103
to be able to afford these exams

157
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,932
you have to have your family contribute,

158
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,681
save up,

159
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:16,682
look for money here and there,

160
00:07:16,882 --> 00:07:21,044
so the exam you must do within a day,

161
00:07:21,271 --> 00:07:23,479
will be done a week later,

162
00:07:23,679 --> 00:07:26,596
so when you multiply the exams,

163
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:30,216
the machines are under-used,

164
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:34,316
and the rate of use

165
00:07:34,516 --> 00:07:38,809
doesn't follow the life expectancy

166
00:07:39,009 --> 00:07:42,092
in order to make the 
machine cost effective

167
00:07:42,292 --> 00:07:43,538
and that,

168
00:07:43,738 --> 00:07:46,263
is how they break down so often

169
00:07:46,463 --> 00:07:49,873
when you haven't even started

170
00:07:50,073 --> 00:07:51,872
to amortize the cost.

171
00:07:52,643 --> 00:07:55,005
The problem is the durability

172
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:57,001
of this equipment.

173
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:59,919
And in the current context,

174
