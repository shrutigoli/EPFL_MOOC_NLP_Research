00:00:13,702 --> 00:00:14,864
Hello.

2
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:17,805
You have now reached a stage
where you need to create

3
00:00:17,977 --> 00:00:21,152
a product from your
innovation concept or idea.

4
00:00:21,564 --> 00:00:24,252
As we said all along,
we don't intend to give you

5
00:00:24,421 --> 00:00:26,721
a course on how
to manufacture products

6
00:00:26,890 --> 00:00:29,990
but rather discuss what
we consider to be crucial points

7
00:00:30,163 --> 00:00:32,288
for consideration
for products conceived

8
00:00:32,468 --> 00:00:36,230
or destined for
developing countries.

9
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:39,097
Manufacturing can be defined
as a value added production

10
00:00:39,273 --> 00:00:43,286
of merchandise for use
or sale using labour, machines

11
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:47,455
tools, chemical
and biological processes.

12
00:00:47,728 --> 00:00:50,065
Or in very simplified terms,
manufacturing 

13
00:00:50,231 --> 00:00:53,231
is the process that turns
your idea into a product.

14
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:57,939
Now, before you begin putting
together your manufacturing strategy

15
00:00:58,099 --> 00:01:01,499
you need to remind yourself
of who your target market is

16
00:01:01,682 --> 00:01:06,795
and what price point
you wish or need to reach.

17
00:01:07,248 --> 00:01:10,248
After that, one of the first things
you need to think about is

18
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:13,470
which elements or components
of your idea or innovation

19
00:01:13,642 --> 00:01:17,904
 really need to be manufactured
from scratch, because in most cases

20
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:19,583
the product can be realized

21
00:01:19,737 --> 00:01:24,599
using existing or available
components, for example,

22
00:01:24,826 --> 00:01:28,563
and bearing in mind that
when you manufacture any product

23
00:01:28,736 --> 00:01:32,986
you will almost always have
various options on which materials

24
00:01:33,148 --> 00:01:36,848
to use and which process
you select to make it.

25
00:01:37,226 --> 00:01:39,489
And the target market
and the price points

26
00:01:39,664 --> 00:01:43,039
you are trying to reach
will play a decisive role

27
00:01:43,195 --> 00:01:45,933
on what choices you make.

28
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:49,717
Now the next major
question to confront is

29
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:54,086
do you manufacture at home,
or do you outsource this abroad,

30
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:56,257
that is offshore?

31
00:01:56,539 --> 00:02:00,027
because today the Contract Manufacturing
industry is highly developed

32
00:02:00,199 --> 00:02:03,036
and now extends far beyond China.

33
00:02:03,208 --> 00:02:05,471
And most of them offer
a turn-key solution,

34
00:02:05,653 --> 00:02:08,628
that is a one-stop shop
that includes packaging

35
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,838
and direct delivery
to your client's doorstep.

36
00:02:12,244 --> 00:02:16,157
For technology based products,
especially, it is highly advisable

37
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,667
to well understand if
and how this industry can

38
00:02:19,819 --> 00:02:23,231
add value to your strategic objective.

39
00:02:23,887 --> 00:02:27,699
However, you should bear in mind,
though, that the manufacturing sector

40
00:02:27,877 --> 00:02:33,915
is often highly coveted by policy
makers in developing countries.

41
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,840
It is viewed as an instrument
and catalyst of modernization

42
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:41,245
and skilled job creation,
as well as a source

43
00:02:41,436 --> 00:02:44,686
of various collateral industries.

44
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:49,200
Governments also promote
local manufacture 

45
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:52,709
with special tax concessions
and reduced tarif rates

46
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:55,845
for importers of manufacturing
machines and equipment,

47
00:02:56,018 --> 00:02:58,906
as well as giving preferential status
for government tenders

48
00:02:59,067 --> 00:03:02,304
to locally manufactured products.

49
00:03:04,347 --> 00:03:08,872
Now, a very important issue
to look into also during

50
00:03:09,048 --> 00:03:11,123
the process of selecting
the operational location

51
00:03:11,284 --> 00:03:13,997
is that of supply
chain management,

52
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:17,349
which is essentially
the management of the flow

53
00:03:17,511 --> 00:03:19,411
of goods and services
into the company

54
00:03:19,601 --> 00:03:24,688
as manufacturing inputs,
or out of the company as products.

55
00:03:25,123 --> 00:03:27,248
You will need to be
fully comfortable

56
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:33,408
on how you will manage this
critical process before you begin.

57
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:36,522
Now, once you have dealt
with the issues above

58
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:41,078
you will need to commence planning
of your operation in more detail.

59
00:03:41,357 --> 00:03:45,469
And one of the top priorities
will be to devise and implement

60
00:03:45,636 --> 00:03:49,673
a suitable quality assurance system.

61
00:03:50,217 --> 00:03:53,217
For technology based
products, especially, 

62
00:03:53,468 --> 00:03:56,781
which can be relatively complex,
it is very important

63
00:03:56,968 --> 00:04:02,118
to have this in place even before
you start your operations.

64
00:04:02,391 --> 00:04:05,391
When it comes to choosing
a location for production

65
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:07,981
there are a number of practical
and key considerations

66
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,147
that can help you make
an informed decision.

67
00:04:11,488 --> 00:04:14,513
First of all,
evaluate your game plan,

68
00:04:14,808 --> 00:04:18,245
which means start by clarifying
the organization strategic goals

69
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:19,824
and objectives.

70
00:04:20,545 --> 00:04:23,183
Do you intend to reduce cost,
for example?

71
00:04:23,348 --> 00:04:25,023
Or serve a new market?

72
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:29,243
Or expedite response time
or diversify risk?

73
00:04:29,724 --> 00:04:32,312
The consideration of
broad organizational goals

74
00:04:32,497 --> 00:04:34,272
into the decision will help

75
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:37,953
to support
the long-term sustainability

76
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:40,960
of your manufacturing investment.

77
00:04:41,723 --> 00:04:45,310
As we mentioned before,
one of the main challenges

78
00:04:45,497 --> 00:04:48,322
faced in the regions
of relevance to this course

79
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:51,494
is the lack of
the skilled workforce.

80
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:54,984
Be sure to do your homework
diligently and meticulously

81
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:58,605
and verify that you will
indeed be able to find

82
00:04:58,775 --> 00:05:01,775
the key required skills for the job.

83
00:05:02,232 --> 00:05:05,857
It maybe necessary to import
certain of these skills from abroad,

84
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:10,800
especially senior personnel who may
come for a certain limited period

85
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:14,592
to effect a skills transfer.
So it will be helpful

86
00:05:14,776 --> 00:05:17,789
to also select a location
that may have some appeal

87
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:19,877
to foreign citizens.

88
00:05:20,275 --> 00:05:23,275
And one of the best sources
for this option is actually

89
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:28,988
the foreign embassies
of the countries of your interest.

90
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:37,209
Look beyond labour costs,
apply a Total-Cost decision model.

91
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:41,073
The location with the lowest
labour costs may not necessarily be

92
00:05:41,232 --> 00:05:45,944
the preferred one or even the most
cost effective place to do business.

93
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:48,933
To make the right choice,
consider a wide range of factors,

94
00:05:49,106 --> 00:05:52,356
including everything from cost
of transportation and electricity,

95
00:05:52,532 --> 00:05:55,932
to supply chain risk
and tax incentives.

96
00:05:56,174 --> 00:05:59,624
Identify and prioritize
all the needs of your business

97
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:03,589
and see how each location
compares against

98
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:05,962
your specific requirements.

99
00:06:06,262 --> 00:06:08,824
Now let's discuss supply chains.

100
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:11,698
The supply chain management
is defined as the management 

101
00:06:11,865 --> 00:06:14,152
of the flow of goods and services.

102
00:06:14,351 --> 00:06:17,488
It involves the movement
and storage of raw materials,

103
00:06:17,662 --> 00:06:21,087
inventory and finished goods
from the point of origin

104
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:23,465
to the point of consumption.

105
00:06:23,909 --> 00:06:25,996
Establishing a viable
and sustainable market

106
00:06:26,182 --> 00:06:28,544
in a region requires, first
and foremost, that customers

107
00:06:28,718 --> 00:06:31,918
have reliable access
to your products.

108
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:34,365
Therefore, before
you begin manufacturing

109
00:06:34,533 --> 00:06:37,458
pay careful attention
to supply chain details

110
00:06:37,637 --> 00:06:40,562
 in the area where your
manufacturing operations

111
00:06:40,736 --> 00:06:41,986
will be carried out.

112
00:06:42,325 --> 00:06:44,987
This point should be also
be factored in during

113
00:06:45,169 --> 00:06:49,006
the selection process of
the manufacturing location.

114
00:06:50,476 --> 00:06:52,701
You should consider
the entire supply chain

115
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:56,711
because many modern factories
are really just assembly operations

116
00:06:56,877 --> 00:06:59,077
 with much of
the actual manufacturing

117
00:06:59,256 --> 00:07:02,256
done by upstream suppliers.

118
00:07:02,662 --> 00:07:06,062
So when deciding where
to locate eventually

119
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:09,932
proximity to your customers
should be an important

120
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:11,807
factor in fact.

121
00:07:13,385 --> 00:07:15,885
Now for example,
if we look at sub-Saharan Africa

122
00:07:16,055 --> 00:07:20,630
there are significant variations
in the logistics costs

123
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:24,688
and lead times required
to access different African markets.

124
00:07:26,067 --> 00:07:33,579
Today, for example, the air freight
hubs of Nairobi in Kenya,

125
00:07:34,397 --> 00:07:35,847
Addis Ababa in Ethiopia,

126
00:07:36,015 --> 00:07:37,827
and Johannesburg in South Africa

127
00:07:37,989 --> 00:07:41,564
provide sufficient capacity
to meet current needs

128
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:43,992
in those regions,
while air cargo capacity

129
00:07:44,158 --> 00:07:46,471
in West Africa is still limited.

130
00:07:46,663 --> 00:07:49,100
Same with ports,
important automotive parts

131
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,667
through Port Apapa in Nigeria
will take over three months,

132
00:07:54,028 --> 00:07:56,415
while importing the same parts
through Durban in South Africa

133
00:07:56,602 --> 00:07:58,602
takes only one month.

134
00:07:59,986 --> 00:08:04,374
And these delays and lead times can
be detrimental to the enterprise.

135
00:08:05,161 --> 00:08:08,124
Now to avoid these delays, the
enterprise may elect to hold

136
00:08:08,307 --> 00:08:11,707
an inventory of big size
and high variety,

137
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:17,331
but for small markets holding such
a big inventory may not be justified,

138
00:08:17,510 --> 00:08:18,860
because there may not be

139
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:21,671
sufficient demand
 to off-take it all.

140
00:08:22,344 --> 00:08:24,807
This means that they
have to order according

141
00:08:24,995 --> 00:08:28,220
to the needs, and with
the longer lead times

142
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:29,907
compared to their counterparts

143
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:32,448
with the better supply
chain ressources,

144
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:36,736
they may suffer reduced
responsiveness, flexibility

145
00:08:36,914 --> 00:08:39,602
and overall competitiveness.

146
00:08:40,385 --> 00:08:42,510
We'll now discuss quality assurance,

147
00:08:42,672 --> 00:08:45,672
which is essentially
the way industries prevent

148
00:08:45,874 --> 00:08:49,574
mistakes or defects
in manufacturing products

149
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,212
and avoid problems
when delivering solutions

150
00:08:52,381 --> 00:08:54,356
or services to the customers.

151
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:56,961
Quality assurance
and quality control

152
00:08:57,121 --> 00:08:59,296
are two very closely
related concepts

153
00:08:59,492 --> 00:09:01,842
and because
of that close relationship

154
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,062
they are often confused
and one is inappropriately

155
00:09:06,223 --> 00:09:09,223
used as a substitute
for the other.

156
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:12,456
Quality assurance
is essentially a system

157
00:09:12,619 --> 00:09:16,369
that is put in place before
 operations begin ideally.

158
00:09:16,693 --> 00:09:20,005
In order to ensure
that the steps of the various processes

159
00:09:20,178 --> 00:09:24,003
will be done in the correct way,
including mechanisms

160
00:09:24,182 --> 00:09:26,620
to prevent mistakes and defects.

161
00:09:27,078 --> 00:09:31,653
If the system is designed properly
or correctly, then there is

162
00:09:31,824 --> 00:09:35,537
a high level of assurance
that the desired results

163
00:09:35,725 --> 00:09:38,400
will turn out as expected.

164
00:09:40,001 --> 00:09:44,564
Whereas quality control is
a series of tests at various stages

165
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:46,214
during the manufacturing process

166
00:09:46,398 --> 00:09:51,398
that verify that the expected
outcome at each stage, as specified

167
00:09:51,563 --> 00:09:54,363
in the quality assurance system,
has been obtained

168
00:09:54,539 --> 00:09:57,164
for each resulting product.

169
00:09:57,443 --> 00:10:00,643
If the correct controls are in place
then you have high certainty

170
00:10:00,815 --> 00:10:05,002
that all the final products are good,
because they have each passed

171
00:10:05,173 --> 00:10:08,173
all the quality control tests.

172
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:13,429
One of the most well known
quality assurance standards

173
00:10:13,878 --> 00:10:17,015
is the ISO 9000

174
00:10:17,379 --> 00:10:19,604
that was first published in 1987.

175
00:10:19,793 --> 00:10:23,955
and has since then been
widely adopted world over.

176
00:10:25,415 --> 00:10:29,628
Apart from this general standard
most industries have

177
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:33,372
their specific standards
that in many sectors

178
00:10:33,542 --> 00:10:35,692
will be mandatory
for your product to be allowed

179
00:10:35,854 --> 00:10:38,016
and sold on the market.

180
00:10:38,307 --> 00:10:41,407
For example,
the quality assurance system

181
00:10:41,579 --> 00:10:44,004
appropriate to the manufacturer
of pharmaceutical products

182
00:10:44,173 --> 00:10:47,511
would involve guidelines such
as good manufacturing practice

183
00:10:47,689 --> 00:10:54,152
or GMP, and other associated codes,
such as good laboratory practice

184
00:10:54,505 --> 00:10:58,493
and good clinical practice,
or GCP.

185
00:10:59,915 --> 00:11:03,727
As a final word it is important
to think about some of the issues

186
00:11:03,881 --> 00:11:07,631
discussed in this lecture
as early as you can

187
00:11:07,872 --> 00:11:11,672
for example, if you can
figure out very early on

188
00:11:11,863 --> 00:11:15,063
that to obtain your product
you need to only manufacture

189
00:11:15,226 --> 00:11:18,563
one component in the end
and the rest you can obtain

190
00:11:18,822 --> 00:11:20,685
in the market,
then you can simply

191
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,937
focus your R&D on the most
crucial part instead of trying

192
00:11:24,109 --> 00:11:26,284
to build the whole system.

193
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:32,795
This would save you
precious time and resources.

194
00:11:32,977 --> 00:11:35,977
Goodbye.
