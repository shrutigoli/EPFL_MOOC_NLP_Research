1
00:00:11,731 --> 00:00:14,681
Now you have managed to deal with 
manufacturing issues and must now

2
00:00:14,862 --> 00:00:17,974
think about convincing your customers

3
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:22,023
to buy the products
you intend to manufacture.

4
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:27,659
In other words, you now need
to establish or refine and finalize

5
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,608
your marketing strategy.

6
00:00:30,581 --> 00:00:33,506
The main objective of a marketing
strategy is to define

7
00:00:33,747 --> 00:00:36,797
the target customers and how
to effectively reach them.

8
00:00:37,609 --> 00:00:40,884
Segmenting the market is especially
important for small businesses,

9
00:00:41,078 --> 00:00:44,566
because they cannot go after every
segment and need to allocate

10
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:46,889
their limited resources selectively.

11
00:00:47,396 --> 00:00:50,846
In the following minutes,
we will discuss various widely used

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,905
approaches for defining or
optimizing a market strategy.

13
00:00:54,509 --> 00:00:56,659
This includes methods such as

14
00:00:57,273 --> 00:01:02,523
Pestle, which stands for political,
economic, social, technological,

15
00:01:02,726 --> 00:01:06,701
legal and environmental issues
around your business.

16
00:01:08,162 --> 00:01:10,074
The Porter's 5 Forces

17
00:01:11,207 --> 00:01:15,557
The SWOT, which stands for
Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities

18
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:18,729
and Threats to your company
and its products.

19
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:22,345
Value Proposition, 
Unique Selling Point and positioning

20
00:01:24,785 --> 00:01:28,010
As well as typical or common
Market Demographics

21
00:01:28,469 --> 00:01:31,294
found in developing countries.

22
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,515
Now, your PESTLE analysis will
help you to have a holistic view

23
00:01:37,218 --> 00:01:38,556
of the position of your product

24
00:01:39,525 --> 00:01:41,563
within its external environment.

25
00:01:42,269 --> 00:01:44,632
The analysis will help your
enterprise understand

26
00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:46,016
the following factors:

27
00:01:46,935 --> 00:01:49,160
Political, this looks at 
the political trends.

28
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,297
For instance, are these trends more
or less in favor of your industry?

29
00:01:53,788 --> 00:01:56,788
Can you expect some incentives
from the government?

30
00:01:57,230 --> 00:01:59,567
Could some laws change and 
impact your business?

31
00:02:00,826 --> 00:02:05,551
Economic, is the economy growing
or rather in recession?

32
00:02:05,822 --> 00:02:10,059
How is the exchange or
the interest rates evolving?

33
00:02:12,275 --> 00:02:15,100
And what about
 inflation and taxes?

34
00:02:15,786 --> 00:02:18,249
Social, how is the demography,

35
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,449
the age pyramid,
the average mortality?

36
00:02:22,633 --> 00:02:24,683
What is the average
level of education?

37
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,020
What are the lifestyle trends?

38
00:02:27,591 --> 00:02:32,016
Technological, are you in line with
technological trends to come?

39
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:36,586
Are there some technological
or technologies that might

40
00:02:36,766 --> 00:02:38,691
make your product obsolete?

41
00:02:39,419 --> 00:02:42,444
Legal, how is the legal system
in the region?

42
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:45,212
And what about Intellectual
Property and enforcement?

43
00:02:46,381 --> 00:02:49,131
Environmental, what sort of
waste regulations

44
00:02:49,773 --> 00:02:51,148
exist for instance?

45
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:55,706
What is the position on energy,
savings and green technologies

46
00:02:55,886 --> 00:02:58,074
transportation issues, etc.

47
00:02:59,434 --> 00:03:03,696
Overall, the information derived
from the PESTLE analysis also

48
00:03:03,899 --> 00:03:06,574
serves as useful input to
the external factors

49
00:03:06,894 --> 00:03:10,044
In the SWOT analysis,
which we discuss later.

50
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:14,547
The Porter's 5 Forces tool is
a simple but powerful tool

51
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:17,736
that is often used to identify
whether new products,

52
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:21,734
services or businesses have
the potential to be successful.

53
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:26,168
It achieves this by helping you
understand where power lies

54
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,070
in the marketplace.
This helps you understand

55
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,547
both the strengths of your
current competitive position

56
00:03:32,225 --> 00:03:36,312
and the strength of the position
you are considering moving into.

57
00:03:38,223 --> 00:03:43,023
Five forces analysis assumes that
there are five important forces

58
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:47,956
that determine competitive power
in a business situation.

59
00:03:48,925 --> 00:03:49,962
And, these are

60
00:03:51,027 --> 00:03:52,202
Supplier Power

61
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:58,074
Here you try and assess how easy it
is for suppliers to drive up prices.

62
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:01,930
Here in general the few other
supplier choices you have

63
00:04:02,307 --> 00:04:04,707
and the more dependent
you are on them

64
00:04:05,412 --> 00:04:09,212
the more powerful your suppliers are
on your business.

65
00:04:11,530 --> 00:04:12,292
Buyer Power

66
00:04:12,747 --> 00:04:17,435
Here you look at how easy it is
for buyers to drive down prices.

67
00:04:17,628 --> 00:04:20,628
Again, this is driven by
the number of buyers,

68
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:23,990
because if you only have a 
few powerful buyers

69
00:04:24,175 --> 00:04:28,850
then they are in a dominant
position to dictate terms to you.

70
00:04:30,782 --> 00:04:32,044
Competitive Rivalry

71
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:36,468
Again, if you have many competitors
and they offer equally attractive

72
00:04:36,645 --> 00:04:40,545
products and services, then you'll
most likely have little power

73
00:04:40,745 --> 00:04:43,832
in this situation, because clients
will go elsewhere

74
00:04:44,573 --> 00:04:46,336
if they don't like your offer.

75
00:04:48,999 --> 00:04:52,474
However, if no one else can do

76
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:57,228
what you do, then you'll hold
a dominant position.

77
00:04:58,735 --> 00:05:00,310
Threat of Substitution

78
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:05,643
This is affected by the ability
of your customers to find

79
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,880
different ways of doing what you do.

80
00:05:09,366 --> 00:05:12,629
If substitution can be achieved
easily, and it is viable

81
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,621
then your position is weak.

82
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:18,301
Threat of New Entry

83
00:05:18,887 --> 00:05:21,687
Power is also affected by
the ability of new players to enter

84
00:05:21,882 --> 00:05:22,557
your market.

85
00:05:22,777 --> 00:05:25,827
If you have strong and durable
barriers to entry then you are

86
00:05:26,008 --> 00:05:28,470
likely to have a favourable position.

87
00:05:28,923 --> 00:05:30,585
Such as a patent, for example.

88
00:05:32,088 --> 00:05:35,188
Now, the information from
the Porter's 5 Forces analysis

89
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:38,753
can thus also flag areas that
may need attention

90
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:41,051
before hitting the market.

91
00:05:42,411 --> 00:05:43,186
SWOT

92
00:05:44,213 --> 00:05:45,825
SWOT which stands for

93
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:50,863
Strengths, Weaknesses,
Opportunities and Threats

94
00:05:51,586 --> 00:05:53,349
is an analytical framework 

95
00:05:53,549 --> 00:05:55,936
but is often used during
strategic planning.

96
00:05:56,328 --> 00:05:58,928
Its primary objective is 
to help organizations

97
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:03,242
develop a full awareness of all
the factors involved in a decision

98
00:06:03,993 --> 00:06:08,693
by identifying both internal
and external influences.

99
00:06:09,476 --> 00:06:12,288
It serves as a precursor to any sort
of company actions,

100
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:16,296
such as exploring new initiatives,
making decisions about new policies

101
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,872
identifying possible areas for change

102
00:06:19,062 --> 00:06:23,712
or refining and redirecting
efforts midway through.

103
00:06:24,555 --> 00:06:27,967
The SWOT analysis requires
the participation of at least

104
00:06:28,155 --> 00:06:30,905
the entire management team, 
for it to provide

105
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,803
maximum benefits
to your organization.

106
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,690
Now, when drafting a SWOT analysis

107
00:06:37,471 --> 00:06:42,209
you typically create a table
comprising of four quadrants,

108
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:47,848
where you list
each impacting element

109
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:50,991
side by side for comparison.

110
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:55,699
Do not necessarily expect strengths
and weaknesses to match with

111
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:58,104
the identified
opportunities and threats.

112
00:06:58,922 --> 00:07:02,134
However, pairing external threats
with internal weaknesses

113
00:07:02,331 --> 00:07:05,031
can help you identify
the most critical issues

114
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,253
faced by your organization.

115
00:07:07,547 --> 00:07:09,185
Internal Factors

116
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:12,368
the first two letters in the acronym

117
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:13,888
S for strengths

118
00:07:14,118 --> 00:07:18,130
and W for weaknesses, refer to
internal factors

119
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:22,189
which means, the resources and
experience readily available to you.

120
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:25,940
Examples of areas typically
considered include

121
00:07:26,152 --> 00:07:29,115
financial resources,
core competences

122
00:07:29,602 --> 00:07:31,089
and intellectual property.

123
00:07:32,088 --> 00:07:35,263
Now, one word of caution when
evaluating your core competences.

124
00:07:35,502 --> 00:07:38,739
You need to actually determine what
you are uniquely good at and

125
00:07:39,764 --> 00:07:42,864
better than others, but which
customers value.

126
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:47,622
This could even be a core process,
which is a key activity that turns

127
00:07:47,827 --> 00:07:49,177
inputs into outputs.

128
00:07:50,447 --> 00:07:53,384
Because, being exceptionally good
at something is not necessarily

129
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:54,584
a strategic advantage.

130
00:07:54,788 --> 00:07:57,713
Instead, you must be exceptionally
good at something

131
00:07:57,942 --> 00:07:59,992
valued by customers.

132
00:08:01,132 --> 00:08:04,707
In fact, some of the information
from your Porter's 5 Forces analysis

133
00:08:05,578 --> 00:08:07,953
could provide useful input here.

134
00:08:09,721 --> 00:08:13,333
It is recommended, though, to start
by analyzing your strengths

135
00:08:13,538 --> 00:08:14,551
and weaknesses first,

136
00:08:14,876 --> 00:08:18,463
as these are factors you
generally have control of,

137
00:08:19,282 --> 00:08:21,969
as opposed to external factors.

138
00:08:23,656 --> 00:08:24,831
External Factors

139
00:08:25,451 --> 00:08:26,488
the last two letters

140
00:08:26,854 --> 00:08:29,054
O for opportunities and
T for threats

141
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:32,591
refer to external factors,
which are often things

142
00:08:32,773 --> 00:08:35,285
your organization does not
have control of.

143
00:08:35,961 --> 00:08:38,848
In fact, many of these factors
are the ones you assessed

144
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:40,981
in your PESTLE analysis

145
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:47,384
such as political, economic,
social trends, etc.

146
00:08:48,161 --> 00:08:53,636
So, all in all, the SWOT tool serves
as an aggregate or dashboard view

147
00:08:53,835 --> 00:08:57,610
that embeds the results from
the other more detailed analyses

148
00:08:57,801 --> 00:09:00,401
we discussed before and
provides an overview

149
00:09:00,629 --> 00:09:05,867
of both harmful and helpful issues
to the enterprise.

150
00:09:06,585 --> 00:09:08,660
In the simplest terms,
a value proposition

151
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,440
is a positioning statement that
explains what benefit you provide

152
00:09:13,648 --> 00:09:17,373
for who and how you do it,
uniquely well.

153
00:09:17,996 --> 00:09:21,584
It describes your target buyer,
the problem you solve

154
00:09:21,866 --> 00:09:26,166
and why you are distinctly better
than the alternatives.

155
00:09:28,104 --> 00:09:30,679
As you set out to create your
compelling value proposition

156
00:09:30,860 --> 00:09:32,810
consider the following four steps:

157
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,492
Define, Evaluate,
Measure and Build.

158
00:09:37,856 --> 00:09:41,219
Number one, Define the problem
and verify whether it's really

159
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,711
a problem worth solving.

160
00:09:43,496 --> 00:09:45,133
There is a saying
in entrepreneurship.

161
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,070
A problem well stated
is a problem half solved.

162
00:09:49,851 --> 00:09:53,751
And unfortunately, many
entrepreneurs still make the mistake

163
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:57,381
of diving deep into the solution,
before fully understanding

164
00:09:57,757 --> 00:10:01,895
what problem they are really
seeking to solve.

165
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,468
Evaluate.

166
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:09,350
That means evaluate whether your
innovation is unique and compelling.

167
00:10:09,541 --> 00:10:12,679
After you've determined and
defined the problem you're solving

168
00:10:12,914 --> 00:10:15,726
and validated its criticality,
ask yourself

169
00:10:16,217 --> 00:10:19,792
what is unique and compelling about
your proposed solution.

170
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:25,669
Measure or estimate the potential
gain for the customer

171
00:10:25,975 --> 00:10:27,125
in adopting your product.

172
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,835
Simply saying that you have
a product or service

173
00:10:30,018 --> 00:10:32,281
that is faster, cheaper and better
is not good enough.

174
00:10:32,467 --> 00:10:33,529
Everybody says so.

175
00:10:33,947 --> 00:10:35,160
So, show me the money.

176
00:10:36,512 --> 00:10:39,224
It is said that, to be successful,
a new venture or product

177
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:41,876
must deliver an order of
magnitude improvement

178
00:10:42,295 --> 00:10:43,770
over the status quo.

179
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:47,126
So, if you can't deliver
a ten times gain promise,

180
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:49,894
you may face the risk that
customers will typically

181
00:10:50,581 --> 00:10:53,131
default to doing nothing,
rather than take the risk 

182
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:55,212
with a new and unknown product.

183
00:10:56,152 --> 00:10:57,690
As a famous saying goes:

184
00:10:58,249 --> 00:10:59,724
Better the devil you know....

185
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,925
Build the value proposition.
Once you've gone

186
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:08,223
through the steps
of defining, evaluating

187
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:11,526
and quantifying your value,
you are now in a position

188
00:11:11,729 --> 00:11:13,854
to build your value proposition.

189
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,988
And here is an example
of a framework

190
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:21,064
that you can use to construct
your value proposition.

191
00:11:24,108 --> 00:11:27,221
For these (target customers);

192
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:31,611
who are dissatisfied

193
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:36,470
with (the current alternative
or status quo);

194
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:39,331
our product is

195
00:11:39,995 --> 00:11:41,445
(a new product);

196
00:11:42,006 --> 00:11:43,181
that provides

197
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:47,317
(these key problem solving
capabilities);

198
00:11:48,014 --> 00:11:51,226
unlike (the product alternative).

199
00:11:52,065 --> 00:11:54,615
This subject will be revisited
in more detail when you

200
00:11:54,807 --> 00:11:58,419
carry out the business model
canvas to later on.

201
00:11:59,088 --> 00:12:01,850
There is often confusion between
value proposition

202
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,475
and unique selling proposition
or USP.

203
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:09,696
So, who is the chicken
and who is the egg?

204
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:13,112
Now, as we heard before

205
00:12:13,661 --> 00:12:17,511
a value proposition is
a description or a clear statement

206
00:12:17,755 --> 00:12:19,192
of the tangible results

207
00:12:19,598 --> 00:12:22,660
a customer gets from using
your products or services.

208
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:26,337
While a unique selling proposition,
or USP

209
00:12:27,002 --> 00:12:30,202
is only that aspect
that differentiates

210
00:12:30,692 --> 00:12:35,142
a product or service from all
other similar products or services.

211
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,305
So, if you want a successful product

212
00:12:38,818 --> 00:12:41,418
it is not enough to
only consider to provide

213
00:12:41,699 --> 00:12:44,574
value, but it must be
possible to set

214
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:50,123
that value apart from other similar
value bearing products

215
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,685
currently available.

216
00:12:52,485 --> 00:12:55,298
So, both the USP and
value proposition

217
00:12:55,486 --> 00:12:56,336
need to exist,

218
00:12:57,143 --> 00:13:00,668
but it must be pointed out that
the USP is inherently

219
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:03,838
part of the value proposition.

220
00:13:04,726 --> 00:13:07,176
So fortunately, here we have 
a clear answer of who is the chicken

221
00:13:07,385 --> 00:13:10,735
and who is the egg.

222
00:13:11,462 --> 00:13:12,725
In one of our earlier videos

223
00:13:12,895 --> 00:13:15,145
on essential technologies
and construction,

224
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,670
we talked about the rising and
rapid rate of urbanization

225
00:13:18,083 --> 00:13:20,183
 in developing countries.

226
00:13:20,603 --> 00:13:23,665
An issue, which has caught many
of these cities off guard

227
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:24,578
in these regions, 

228
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:27,233
and unprepared for these mass
migrations, which

229
00:13:27,456 --> 00:13:30,868
resulted in the emergence of slums,
as we discussed.

230
00:13:31,973 --> 00:13:35,198
So, estimating market demand and
developing a market

231
00:13:35,378 --> 00:13:37,790
in developing countries poses
a significant challenge.

232
00:13:39,673 --> 00:13:43,036
This challenge arises
from the coexistence

233
00:13:43,203 --> 00:13:47,390
of three distinct kinds of markets
in a single country.

234
00:13:49,069 --> 00:13:51,869
The rural or agricultural sector.

235
00:13:53,546 --> 00:13:56,233
The modern urban
or high income sector.

236
00:13:57,473 --> 00:13:59,611
And the very large
transitional sector

237
00:14:00,255 --> 00:14:03,405
usually represented by low income
urban slums.

238
00:14:05,007 --> 00:14:07,557
The modern sector comprises
the rapidly expanding

239
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,302
middle class that is typically
located in the plush effluent

240
00:14:10,508 --> 00:14:11,633
areas of the city

241
00:14:11,926 --> 00:14:15,176
and may have easier access to
all sorts of infrastructure

242
00:14:15,505 --> 00:14:16,330
and amenities.

243
00:14:17,304 --> 00:14:20,391
The traditional rural sector
tends to work in the countryside

244
00:14:20,804 --> 00:14:22,429
as it has for decades.

245
00:14:23,261 --> 00:14:26,536
Now, production and consumption
patterns vary across

246
00:14:27,137 --> 00:14:29,462
these three different sectors.

247
00:14:29,683 --> 00:14:32,483
Therefore, when you establish
a market strategy, one must take

248
00:14:32,682 --> 00:14:34,932
into consideration that
developing countries

249
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:37,778
will have these three different
market segments.

250
00:14:38,873 --> 00:14:41,173
Each can prove profitable,

251
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:43,934
but each requires its own
marketing program

252
00:14:44,128 --> 00:14:46,690
and products and services
that are appropriate

253
00:14:46,889 --> 00:14:48,501
for its market characteristics.

254
00:14:49,492 --> 00:14:53,205
For example, you may need to employ
a two tier pricing plan,

255
00:14:53,411 --> 00:14:55,324
where you charge
a slightly higher price

256
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:58,247
for the effluent clientele,
while offering

257
00:14:58,472 --> 00:15:01,360
a lower, affordable price to
the public sector

258
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:02,927
and rural districts.

259
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:07,030
Now, when pricing for
the less affording segments

260
00:15:07,268 --> 00:15:09,856
for certain products,
it may be a good strategy

261
00:15:10,044 --> 00:15:12,806
to think about applying
a price that considers

262
00:15:12,996 --> 00:15:15,083
not just the acquisition price,

263
00:15:15,485 --> 00:15:18,510
but rather the total cost
of ownership during the lifetime

264
00:15:18,725 --> 00:15:19,550
of the product,

265
00:15:19,881 --> 00:15:21,481
such as routine servicing

266
00:15:22,092 --> 00:15:25,454
and the repair
of certain parts, etc.

267
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:28,242
Somewhat similar to the
automotive industries

268
00:15:28,434 --> 00:15:32,296
that offer, say, a ten year
warranty on a new

269
00:15:32,499 --> 00:15:33,674
car purchase price.

270
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,018
This could be an important

271
00:15:36,214 --> 00:15:38,239
differentiating point
from competition,

272
00:15:38,452 --> 00:15:41,677
as the clients in these markets
tend not to have

273
00:15:41,938 --> 00:15:44,525
steady and reliable
revenue streams,

274
00:15:45,039 --> 00:15:46,251
including governments.

275
00:15:47,621 --> 00:15:50,396
Which, in fact, is also
one of the reasons

276
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:52,971
that many enterprises
in these markets

277
00:15:53,184 --> 00:15:55,134
employ a pay as you go

278
00:15:55,322 --> 00:15:57,647
or pay for use
business model.

279
00:15:59,803 --> 00:16:02,116
Now, branding
is a very important

280
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,144
and tricky subject,

281
00:16:03,324 --> 00:16:06,274
because even the customers
at the bottom of the pyramid

282
00:16:06,716 --> 00:16:10,478
are highly sensitive to the
prestigious and powerful brands.

283
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,337
However, bear in mind that a lot

284
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:16,589
of these products from powerful
brands were designed for the needs

285
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:20,391
of industrialized countries
and tend to not fit well

286
00:16:20,677 --> 00:16:24,040
with the needs of the markets
in developing countries.

287
00:16:24,927 --> 00:16:28,177
Therefore, you may have a great
opportunity if you can

288
00:16:28,394 --> 00:16:31,582
better focus and tailor your
value proposition

289
00:16:31,764 --> 00:16:34,089
and USP with this in mind.

290
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,525
In general, it is highly recommended
to launch your product

291
00:16:37,719 --> 00:16:40,007
in your domicile market,
which may or may not

292
00:16:40,191 --> 00:16:42,953
be sufficiently large for your
product to be sustainable.

293
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:45,892
Whatever the case,
it is strategically important

294
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:49,040
to evaluate and export
an expansion opportunities

295
00:16:49,204 --> 00:16:51,829
beyond your domestic market
as early as possible.

296
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:57,203
Today, virtually
all developing countries

297
00:16:57,419 --> 00:17:00,682
tend to be part of regional
trade corridors

298
00:17:01,481 --> 00:17:03,044
and economic agreements.

299
00:17:03,681 --> 00:17:06,843
As a first step towards achieving
economies scale and being

300
00:17:07,032 --> 00:17:09,345
able to reach several countries
in your region,

301
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:11,169
adopt a regional approach.

302
00:17:11,921 --> 00:17:14,158
If we look at Africa as an example.

303
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:18,640
Many organizations have tended
to divide it into four zones.

304
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:22,032
With roughly comparable GDP's.

305
00:17:22,231 --> 00:17:26,468
These zones are Southern Africa,
Eastern Africa, Western Africa

306
00:17:26,657 --> 00:17:27,682
and Maghreb.

307
00:17:29,317 --> 00:17:31,242
Picking the correct
regional breakdowns

308
00:17:31,702 --> 00:17:34,577
and developing sustainable
partnerships with those regions

309
00:17:34,761 --> 00:17:37,248
can be highly beneficial on
aspects such as

310
00:17:37,907 --> 00:17:40,257
supply chain networks, for example.

311
00:17:42,058 --> 00:17:43,220
As mentioned before

312
00:17:44,181 --> 00:17:46,844
you may also benefit from
preferential bidding opportunities

313
00:17:47,025 --> 00:17:48,862
for large government tenders,

314
00:17:49,207 --> 00:17:51,294
even from other countries
in the whole sub-region,

315
00:17:51,483 --> 00:17:53,245
in cases where trade corridors

316
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,457
and agreements have
or are being established.

317
00:17:57,033 --> 00:18:00,033
Such as is the case in
Southern Africa

318
00:18:00,446 --> 00:18:01,921
and East Africa, for example.

319
00:18:03,704 --> 00:18:07,029
Now lets try and put some
of the things we discussed today

320
00:18:07,748 --> 00:18:08,886
in perspective.

321
00:18:09,172 --> 00:18:12,835
Let me start by asking you
a simple question.

322
00:18:13,697 --> 00:18:17,534
Which region in the world will have
the largest working age population

323
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,154
in the world by 2035?

324
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,207
We'll come back to that question
in a moment.

325
00:18:24,448 --> 00:18:26,873
Now, you might be asking yourself

326
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:30,072
should I really bother about
this PESTLE stuff or not?

327
00:18:33,729 --> 00:18:36,491
In our earlier lesson,
we saw a bleak picture about

328
00:18:36,686 --> 00:18:39,123
the extent of poverty and
all other doom and gloom

329
00:18:39,322 --> 00:18:41,109
in Sub-Saharan Africa, especially.

330
00:18:41,372 --> 00:18:44,559
In fact, it turns out that some
of the fastest growing economies

331
00:18:44,745 --> 00:18:47,157
in the world are,
in fact, in this region.

332
00:18:47,552 --> 00:18:49,977
It also turns out that
Africa will have the largest

333
00:18:50,167 --> 00:18:52,317
working age population in the world

334
00:18:52,668 --> 00:18:55,918
of 1.1 billion by 2034.

335
00:18:56,339 --> 00:19:00,477
This is a highly valuable asset
in this rapidly aging world today.

336
00:19:01,507 --> 00:19:05,444
And Africa will continue to have
the highest urbanisation trends,

337
00:19:06,518 --> 00:19:09,518
which implies that there will be
continued strong growth

338
00:19:09,967 --> 00:19:12,867
in the urban, low income
market segments,

339
00:19:13,062 --> 00:19:15,174
but as well as the affluent segments,

340
00:19:15,368 --> 00:19:19,268
if taking into account the expected
strong economic growth.

341
00:19:20,288 --> 00:19:22,450
Now, having all this knowledge
could assist you

342
00:19:22,637 --> 00:19:25,112
in planning and making
decisions timely

343
00:19:25,315 --> 00:19:28,090
to invest in tailored products
and assuring proper

344
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:31,779
supply chains for
each of these segments.

345
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:35,354
And how would you timely
obtain all of this information?

346
00:19:36,031 --> 00:19:38,569
By doing your PESTLE analysis,
for example.

347
00:19:39,187 --> 00:19:43,437
And also the Porter's 5 Forces
and SWOT analysis.

348
00:19:44,095 --> 00:19:48,183
And having your value proposition
and USP will enable you

349
00:19:48,401 --> 00:19:51,064
to pinpoint your real,
addressable market

350
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:55,893
as opposed to trying to infer
that from market reports

351
00:19:57,047 --> 00:20:00,997
which tend to be rather general and
unaffordable to most entrepreneurs.

352
00:20:02,262 --> 00:20:03,312
So, in conclusion

353
00:20:04,641 --> 00:20:06,903
To PESTLE or not to PESTLE?

354
00:20:08,317 --> 00:20:10,105
That's the million dollar question.

355
00:20:10,273 --> 00:20:11,323
Goodbye.
