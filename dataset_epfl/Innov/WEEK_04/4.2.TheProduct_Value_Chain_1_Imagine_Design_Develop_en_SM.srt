1
00:00:20,883 --> 00:00:21,620
Hello!

2
00:00:21,773 --> 00:00:24,135
The first activity in
the product value chain

3
00:00:24,304 --> 00:00:26,604
is to imagine and
develop the product.

4
00:00:27,374 --> 00:00:31,424
As discussed in the overview, our
purpose is not to give you a course

5
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:36,678
on R&D project management, but rather to
bring up a few key strategic topics

6
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:40,441
that are especially relevant in
the context of this MOOC.

7
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:43,320
These topics are:
The needs assessment

8
00:00:43,477 --> 00:00:46,339
by which we strive to
clearly understand

9
00:00:46,493 --> 00:00:49,842
what is the current situation of
our technology in the context

10
00:00:50,009 --> 00:00:51,533
we are considering.

11
00:00:51,703 --> 00:00:55,715
This will allow us to determine if
we need a complete redesign of

12
00:00:55,891 --> 00:00:59,691
the technology, or a mere evolution
of something existing.

13
00:01:00,053 --> 00:01:04,877
Then the definition of the product
specifications is absolutely crucial

14
00:01:05,048 --> 00:01:08,373
and we will explain what kind
of topics should be included.

15
00:01:08,843 --> 00:01:12,517
Once we have our basic
specifications, we need to

16
00:01:12,694 --> 00:01:16,506
think in terms of partnerships,
who do we need to partner with

17
00:01:16,684 --> 00:01:20,446
in order to develop our solutions,
can we bring in some strategic

18
00:01:20,638 --> 00:01:23,988
partners who could help
us accelerate our process.

19
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:28,773
Another key subject is the one
related to industry standards and

20
00:01:28,983 --> 00:01:31,695
regulations applicable
to our product.

21
00:01:31,895 --> 00:01:34,895
They will need to be
clearly identified early on.

22
00:01:35,212 --> 00:01:39,161
Then we have to consider
the angle of intellectual property,

23
00:01:39,364 --> 00:01:42,689
such as patents
trademarks and copyrights.

24
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:46,527
And finally there is the user
experience of the product.

25
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:50,704
Design is important in all markets
and this should not be neglected

26
00:01:50,872 --> 00:01:51,872
here either.

27
00:01:52,037 --> 00:01:55,050
Let us look into these
different topics.

28
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:59,098
The first step is to analyze
the need for the product.

29
00:01:59,276 --> 00:02:03,438
What are the current technologies
that are being used, if there is no

30
00:02:03,627 --> 00:02:07,814
technology solution available at
all, what are the alternatives or

31
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:12,366
substitutes that people have
found in our target context?

32
00:02:12,571 --> 00:02:16,883
We need to honestly define
what are the pros and cons of

33
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:18,892
existing solutions.

34
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:21,164
This requires a close collaboration

35
00:02:21,344 --> 00:02:23,669
with the people who
we are trying to help

36
00:02:23,857 --> 00:02:26,982
as well as other stakeholders.

37
00:02:27,441 --> 00:02:31,153
After having analyzed the market
situation, we will be able to

38
00:02:31,332 --> 00:02:35,657
come up with innovative solutions
that may, or may not involve

39
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:38,989
a complete redesign
of the technology.

40
00:02:39,156 --> 00:02:42,843
The solution may simply consist
of a smart and different use

41
00:02:43,031 --> 00:02:47,143
of some existing technology,
or it may involve a profoundly

42
00:02:47,315 --> 00:02:48,890
disruptive innovation.

43
00:02:49,087 --> 00:02:54,086
This is a strategic decision, because
if you have to completely redesign

44
00:02:54,255 --> 00:03:00,143
the technology, both the risks
and the efforts will be much higher.

45
00:03:00,481 --> 00:03:05,781
On the other hand, the impact may
also be much more important.

46
00:03:06,636 --> 00:03:09,561
It is important to capture
the results of the needs

47
00:03:09,758 --> 00:03:13,945
assessment in the form
of written specifications.

48
00:03:14,251 --> 00:03:17,463
What is important is that
these specifications need

49
00:03:17,652 --> 00:03:20,202
to be quantitative
and measurable.

50
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:23,659
For example, saying that
a water treatment system

51
00:03:23,851 --> 00:03:28,151
must have the highest possible
output is not good enough.

52
00:03:28,338 --> 00:03:31,901
We must be able to describe
the output in quantitative terms,

53
00:03:32,094 --> 00:03:38,031
for example, the pump must be
able to deliver 100L per hour.

54
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:43,683
Specifications don't just capture
technical characteristics, but

55
00:03:43,866 --> 00:03:49,404
many other aspects that will depend also on the other
segments of the product value chain.

56
00:03:49,602 --> 00:03:54,026
Specifications will typically
include the following rubrics,

57
00:03:54,225 --> 00:03:58,500
but there might be many others,
depending on the industry:

58
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,590
Technical characteristic which
capture key technical elements

59
00:04:03,786 --> 00:04:08,386
of your product, 
Performance characteristics, which are

60
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:12,198
closely related to the customer needs.

61
00:04:12,991 --> 00:04:18,003
Applicable standards and regulatory
requirements and we will come back

62
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:20,819
to this particular topic.

63
00:04:21,167 --> 00:04:25,792
Product risks, very often
safety of persons may depend

64
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:31,342
on the product, which means that
we will have to conduct a product

65
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:34,057
risk evaluation.

66
00:04:34,254 --> 00:04:39,316
Quality level, obviously, we would
like to provide solutions that are

67
00:04:39,505 --> 00:04:44,618
ultra durable, however this comes
with a cost and there has to be

68
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,254
a trade off.

69
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:51,888
Assessing customer's expectation
or comparing existing solutions

70
00:04:52,087 --> 00:04:54,112
might provide useful information

71
00:04:54,291 --> 00:04:57,816
about the quality level
to be achieved.

72
00:04:58,936 --> 00:05:03,886
Production means, prior to any
development it is important that we

73
00:05:04,071 --> 00:05:07,708
think about how and where
to manufacture the product.

74
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:11,715
We will review that in more
detail in a later video.

75
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:13,670
Target price.

76
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:17,776
Target price must be coherent
with the market expectations,

77
00:05:17,947 --> 00:05:21,510
while still allowing your
company to be sustainable.

78
00:05:21,872 --> 00:05:24,384
We will see how to
achieve this balance

79
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,272
in a later video.

80
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:28,810
Packaging and distribution.

81
00:05:28,982 --> 00:05:33,357
We must specify how we will
package and ship the product.

82
00:05:33,537 --> 00:05:37,949
This is linked to the distribute
segment that we will see

83
00:05:38,124 --> 00:05:40,362
in a later video as well.

84
00:05:41,553 --> 00:05:44,428
Support use and
especially maintenance.

85
00:05:44,606 --> 00:05:48,130
It is important to know how
we will support the use of our

86
00:05:48,297 --> 00:05:50,309
product, for example, by defining

87
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,833
which maintenance
activities are necessary.

88
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:58,916
As the goal is to maximize impact,
it would be great to be able

89
00:05:59,110 --> 00:06:03,110
to minimize the need for
maintenance and spare parts.

90
00:06:03,285 --> 00:06:08,698
We will see that in detail in
the last segment of the value chain.

91
00:06:09,095 --> 00:06:11,470
Product evolution.

92
00:06:11,643 --> 00:06:15,393
Most of the products will evolve
in the course of time because of

93
00:06:15,562 --> 00:06:18,874
changes in the technology
and in the market.

94
00:06:19,466 --> 00:06:23,241
Some of these changes can
be anticipated in the design

95
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:28,575
so that a product will be
easily up-gradable if need be.

96
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:34,268
We should make sure to think about
about our product as a platform for

97
00:06:34,438 --> 00:06:36,551
future evolution.

98
00:06:36,723 --> 00:06:39,723
Discontinuations and recycling.

99
00:06:39,915 --> 00:06:44,390
Sooner or later our product
will be worn out or obsolete

100
00:06:44,653 --> 00:06:47,115
and it will need to be phased out.

101
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:52,963
The question of how our product
will be recycled is very crucial

102
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:58,377
because we don't want to create harm
to humans or to the environment.

103
00:06:59,007 --> 00:07:02,007
And finally we have verification.

104
00:07:02,178 --> 00:07:07,190
We must think of how we will make
sure that our product complies

105
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:11,103
with what has been specified
in the previous points.

106
00:07:11,604 --> 00:07:16,892
If a specification is not very
viable it is not adequate. 

107
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:23,141
There are many rubrics in this list
but it is still not exhaustive, but our

108
00:07:23,337 --> 00:07:27,612
hope is that it helps you ask
yourself the right questions.

109
00:07:28,215 --> 00:07:31,453
Our next strategic
topic is partnerships.

110
00:07:31,814 --> 00:07:35,201
This is of course a very valid
question in all of the product

111
00:07:35,397 --> 00:07:37,659
value chains segments.

112
00:07:37,892 --> 00:07:42,867
But we decided to insist on it,
especially in this one, as it is

113
00:07:43,051 --> 00:07:45,289
where it is often overlooked.

114
00:07:45,476 --> 00:07:49,750
Inventors like to do things
themselves, and this is fine

115
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:54,302
as long as we are not missing an
opportunity to be more efficient.

116
00:07:54,493 --> 00:07:59,231
Projects could often be accelerated
if we were able to overcome

117
00:07:59,404 --> 00:08:03,754
the infamous "not invented here"
syndrome.

118
00:08:04,364 --> 00:08:09,152
Procter & Gamble has famously tried
to correct this very human behavior

119
00:08:09,332 --> 00:08:14,257
by promoting the motto:
"Proudly found elsewhere".

120
00:08:14,444 --> 00:08:18,031
We should never refrain from
partnering in the interest of our

121
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:21,876
objective, because an efficient product
development partnership

122
00:08:22,053 --> 00:08:26,028
can make you avoid years
of painstaking work.

123
00:08:27,289 --> 00:08:31,827
We have also repeatedly insisted
on the importance of collaborating

124
00:08:32,006 --> 00:08:35,006
with local partners and
across disciplines.

125
00:08:35,312 --> 00:08:38,887
There is hardly any moment
when it is more important than

126
00:08:39,063 --> 00:08:41,350
in the early phases
of a project.

127
00:08:41,527 --> 00:08:45,665
We need to ask ourselves
who could be a good partner?

128
00:08:46,132 --> 00:08:49,918
It could be an institution,
a company, an NGO

129
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:52,543
or simply an individual.

130
00:08:52,718 --> 00:08:57,804
Another important topic is related
to standards and regulations.

131
00:08:57,983 --> 00:09:01,283
Getting into details would
take another MOOC.

132
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:06,481
Broadly speaking, a standard is
a set of rules which define

133
00:09:06,642 --> 00:09:10,942
a preconceived way to design
or test some product.

134
00:09:11,392 --> 00:09:15,791
Standards are generally developed
by organizations such as

135
00:09:15,968 --> 00:09:19,442
the International Standards
Organization or the ISO, or

136
00:09:19,606 --> 00:09:24,381
the International Electrical
Commission or IEC.

137
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:29,000
The application of standards is
generally voluntary, but can

138
00:09:29,168 --> 00:09:34,855
become mandatory if adopted by
a government through legislation.

139
00:09:35,161 --> 00:09:40,048
In Europe and some other places,
products are required to beat

140
00:09:40,228 --> 00:09:47,040
the CE mark, formally this indicates
that the product complies with

141
00:09:47,204 --> 00:09:51,329
the European legislation
for that category of products.

142
00:09:51,561 --> 00:09:55,810
This does not necessarily mean
that the product complies to all

143
00:09:55,984 --> 00:09:59,659
technical standards existing
for that product category,

144
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:02,184
but certainly to some of them.

145
00:10:02,365 --> 00:10:06,139
We will need to check for
our target country or region

146
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:09,583
what the legal requirements are
for our product.

147
00:10:09,792 --> 00:10:14,391
This can sometimes be time
consuming and expensive, especially

148
00:10:14,573 --> 00:10:17,985
when the countries define
their own rules to protect

149
00:10:18,156 --> 00:10:20,518
their local industries.

150
00:10:20,687 --> 00:10:24,798
Another challenge is that the standards
have evolved with the progress made

151
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:29,670
in industrialized countries and may
not be well adapted to the situation

152
00:10:29,856 --> 00:10:32,406
in low and middle income countries.

153
00:10:33,367 --> 00:10:37,891
Now we would like to discuss
a crucial ethical issue.

154
00:10:38,065 --> 00:10:42,139
It is not because some low income
countries have loopholes

155
00:10:42,307 --> 00:10:44,806
in their legislation that we should

156
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,626
neglect the compliance
with key standards

157
00:10:47,802 --> 00:10:49,526
for our product.

158
00:10:49,705 --> 00:10:55,042
We don't want to develop poor
technologies for poor countries.

159
00:10:55,216 --> 00:10:59,003
In spite of the challenge,
we strongly believe that

160
00:10:59,181 --> 00:11:03,455
every human being deserves
the same level of product quality

161
00:11:03,627 --> 00:11:06,627
safety and effectiveness.

162
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:12,023
We need to resist the temptation of
making short-cuts and neglecting

163
00:11:12,193 --> 00:11:17,555
relevant standards, even if it makes
the project much more difficult.

164
00:11:17,965 --> 00:11:21,652
We give you a simple rule
to know if you have achieved

165
00:11:21,836 --> 00:11:25,161
a sufficient level of
safety and effectiveness.

166
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:28,543
Would you be allowed to
sell your technology in

167
00:11:28,723 --> 00:11:30,961
an industrialized country?

168
00:11:31,218 --> 00:11:34,218
If the answer is yes,
then you're fine.

169
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,827
Our best advice is to have a good
discussion with people who

170
00:11:37,998 --> 00:11:41,348
know this subject early
on in your project.

171
00:11:41,709 --> 00:11:46,233
Also, a lot of relevant information
can be found on the internet.

172
00:11:46,418 --> 00:11:49,818
For example, on
the website of the IEC.

173
00:11:50,433 --> 00:11:54,258
Another important topic is
intellectual property protection.

174
00:11:54,602 --> 00:11:57,752
Here as well the subject
would require another MOOC.

175
00:11:58,401 --> 00:12:02,387
I will not discuss trademarks
or copyrights but concentrate

176
00:12:02,562 --> 00:12:04,237
on patents.

177
00:12:04,431 --> 00:12:08,430
Patents are intended
as incentive to invent.

178
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:12,844
A patent is a means by which
the authorities grant the inventor

179
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:17,212
a time limited exclusivity for
the commercial exploitation 

180
00:12:17,388 --> 00:12:20,375
of his or her invention.

181
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:24,616
the process of filing and
managing a patent is complex

182
00:12:24,781 --> 00:12:28,381
and support from a specialist
is generally required.

183
00:12:29,011 --> 00:12:32,423
However, we have to carefully
think about our strategy

184
00:12:32,597 --> 00:12:37,785
regarding patents before hand,
because they are very expensive.

185
00:12:37,973 --> 00:12:43,385
Not only are the filing costs high,
but there also many additional fees

186
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:47,083
that will have to be paid all
along the patents lifetime,

187
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:50,258
which is limited to twenty years.

188
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:53,987
Over it's lifetime a patent
filed in a dozen countries

189
00:12:54,169 --> 00:12:58,380
can easily cost up to several
hundred thousand dollars in total

190
00:12:58,570 --> 00:13:02,458
and this does not even
include potential litigation.

191
00:13:03,012 --> 00:13:08,537
The costs must really be offset by
the benefits obtained from

192
00:13:08,715 --> 00:13:11,103
the patents exclusivity rights.

193
00:13:11,283 --> 00:13:15,608
It is, thus, fundamental to ask
yourself if a protection offered

194
00:13:15,784 --> 00:13:18,159
by a patent is worthwhile.

195
00:13:18,718 --> 00:13:23,280
Also, you will have to designate
the countries in which you want to

196
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:26,252
request protection
for your invention.

197
00:13:26,433 --> 00:13:30,295
Every additional country
or region will increase costs.

198
00:13:30,901 --> 00:13:35,575
On the contrary, you may decide
not to pursue any patent protection

199
00:13:35,754 --> 00:13:40,429
at all, and leave the invention
open for everyone to use.

200
00:13:41,497 --> 00:13:44,497
There is a downside to
this strategy, however.

201
00:13:44,808 --> 00:13:49,320
At a later stage you will perhaps
want to involve investors and they

202
00:13:49,504 --> 00:13:54,404
usually like to see patents, because
they are barriers to entry for your

203
00:13:54,605 --> 00:13:59,779
competitors, it is a way to keep
your company competitive and

204
00:13:59,984 --> 00:14:03,147
sustainable, so there is
a balance to be found.

205
00:14:03,623 --> 00:14:07,397
On the other hand, in case
of infringement of your patent

206
00:14:07,572 --> 00:14:10,471
defending it against an
an unfair competitor 

207
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:15,150
could cost you years of litigation,
which could lead to bankruptcy.

208
00:14:15,783 --> 00:14:18,995
There is one additional important
thing we need to keep in mind.

209
00:14:19,179 --> 00:14:22,528
Any public disclosure of
an invention before it has been

210
00:14:22,704 --> 00:14:26,842
filed will prevent you from
seeking patent protection.

211
00:14:27,394 --> 00:14:31,968
This public disclosure could be
in the form of publication in

212
00:14:32,158 --> 00:14:36,270
a news paper, on the internet,
or simply a poster placed in

213
00:14:36,457 --> 00:14:38,157
a public location.

214
00:14:38,767 --> 00:14:43,579
We have to be especially careful
with our partners as they sometimes

215
00:14:43,753 --> 00:14:46,452
disclose things inadvertently.

216
00:14:46,633 --> 00:14:50,344
Conversely, if you do not want
to patent your invention

217
00:14:50,526 --> 00:14:54,038
you should disclose it publicly,
as otherwise someone could

218
00:14:54,219 --> 00:14:58,093
come along and file a patent on your
invention, which he could then use

219
00:14:58,278 --> 00:14:59,541
against you.

220
00:14:59,724 --> 00:15:03,311
This tactic is called
defensive publishing.

221
00:15:03,718 --> 00:15:07,018
As you may find out,
your idea may have already

222
00:15:07,212 --> 00:15:09,274
been patented before.

223
00:15:09,744 --> 00:15:12,706
This could entitle someone
else to prevent you from

224
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,604
using your innovation
or to claim payments

225
00:15:15,799 --> 00:15:17,123
or royalties.

226
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:21,609
To anticipate this problem you need
to assess your freedom to operate.

227
00:15:21,796 --> 00:15:25,583
An easy way to check if
a patent is still enforced

228
00:15:25,777 --> 00:15:28,701
is to look at the so
called priority date.

229
00:15:28,876 --> 00:15:33,588
If the date is over twenty years ago
you're most probably fine.

230
00:15:33,888 --> 00:15:37,912
It could also be that the inventor
has stopped paying the fees and

231
00:15:38,084 --> 00:15:43,022
the patent is no longer valid, even
if it is less than twenty years old.

232
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,347
It is also important to check if
the filing was done in your target

233
00:15:48,528 --> 00:15:50,577
country or region.

234
00:15:50,754 --> 00:15:54,978
It could be that a specific patent
has been filed in a high income

235
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:57,671
country only because
the patent owner

236
00:15:57,842 --> 00:16:02,667
did not consider the others as
potentially interesting markets.

237
00:16:03,467 --> 00:16:07,941
There are searchable databases
on the patents on the internet,

238
00:16:08,119 --> 00:16:13,319
which allow you to see if
a specific patent is still active.

239
00:16:14,138 --> 00:16:19,075
Finally, we would like to insist
on the value of a patent as

240
00:16:19,248 --> 00:16:20,960
a bargaining tool.

241
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:25,350
If you own a patent it could be
used to negotiate a partnership

242
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:27,774
with an established company.

243
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:32,322
In exchange for the right to use
your invention that company

244
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:36,378
could, for example, manufacture
some products for you

245
00:16:36,545 --> 00:16:41,470
at a favorable price, or help
you distribute you technology.

246
00:16:42,187 --> 00:16:46,386
There are many more possibilities
of win-win partnerships which

247
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:51,970
can be negotiated if you own
the rights to a valuable invention.

248
00:16:52,823 --> 00:16:56,248
Finally there is
the user experience.

249
00:16:56,437 --> 00:16:59,648
Design is much more
than the look of a product

250
00:16:59,845 --> 00:17:03,632
it is really about optimizing
the interaction between the product

251
00:17:03,803 --> 00:17:05,065
and the user.

252
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:08,616
It is not because a customer
lives in a developing country

253
00:17:08,788 --> 00:17:13,463
that he or she is not sensitive to
the look and feel of the product,

254
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,470
quite the opposite, in fact.

255
00:17:15,656 --> 00:17:20,093
As we have already said in the past,
we should put our future product

256
00:17:20,282 --> 00:17:22,493
in contact with our
potential customers

257
00:17:22,696 --> 00:17:24,708
as soon as possible.

258
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:28,225
As we are working with
the product value chain tool,

259
00:17:28,417 --> 00:17:31,279
for instance, we should
provide them with mock-ups

260
00:17:31,452 --> 00:17:33,852
or rough-and-ready prototypes

261
00:17:34,036 --> 00:17:37,236
and pay attention to their comments.

262
00:17:37,449 --> 00:17:41,487
Here, again, the aim is to
identify potential miss-matches

263
00:17:41,655 --> 00:17:46,755
with our assumptions and adapt
our product as early as possible.

264
00:17:47,199 --> 00:17:50,474
Remember,
it is better to fail early

265
00:17:50,659 --> 00:17:55,484
to fail often, and to fail cheap,
as failures at a later stage will

266
00:17:55,661 --> 00:17:58,936
have much more severe consequences.

267
00:17:59,822 --> 00:18:01,897
Goodbye.
