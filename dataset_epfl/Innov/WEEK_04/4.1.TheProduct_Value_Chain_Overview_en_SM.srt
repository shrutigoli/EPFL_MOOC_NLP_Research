1
00:00:10,062 --> 00:00:10,800
 Hello. 

2
00:00:10,974 --> 00:00:13,012
As we have seen in a previous video,

3
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:17,850
we now have a tool and approach
to define our theory of change

4
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:22,362
and how our project will lead to
impact on a specific issue. 

5
00:00:22,842 --> 00:00:26,779
Now we need to look into the
technological product that we want

6
00:00:26,967 --> 00:00:30,467
to develop and how this product will
be made available to the user.

7
00:00:31,463 --> 00:00:34,400
There are several questions that
we will need to answer.

8
00:00:35,018 --> 00:00:38,804
How can we capture the key
activities and steps needed for

9
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:42,836
our product to be available to our
user in a sustainable way?

10
00:00:43,422 --> 00:00:46,834
How can we identify all
the stakeholders whose

11
00:00:47,029 --> 00:00:48,567
intervention is crucial?

12
00:00:49,013 --> 00:00:53,025
How can we make sure that we have
captured most of the technological

13
00:00:53,217 --> 00:00:55,242
and business constraints?

14
00:00:55,447 --> 00:00:59,471
In this chapter we will introduce
a new tool to you, which we have

15
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,954
developed to help envision the chain
of activities that are required

16
00:01:04,121 --> 00:01:05,696
in order to achieve our goal.

17
00:01:05,947 --> 00:01:09,623
We call it The Product Value Chain
analysis tool. 

18
00:01:10,905 --> 00:01:14,142
The concept of Value Chain was
developed by Michael Porter

19
00:01:14,343 --> 00:01:16,356
back in 1985.

20
00:01:16,845 --> 00:01:21,244
As he had defined it, the Value Chain
referred to the organisation of a

21
00:01:21,445 --> 00:01:24,245
company or a business
unit as a whole.

22
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:28,445
The idea was that each group of
activity in the company, such as

23
00:01:28,645 --> 00:01:32,707
operations, logistics or marketing,
are a segment of the chain.

24
00:01:33,107 --> 00:01:36,506
Each segment consumes resources
and adds value to the final

25
00:01:36,695 --> 00:01:38,133
output of the company.

26
00:01:38,863 --> 00:01:41,838
This definition is not the one
that we will use here.

27
00:01:42,343 --> 00:01:46,730
Our concept of Value Chain, which we
explain in the this chapter, focuses

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:51,377
on the product itself and not on the
internal organisation of a company.

29
00:01:51,868 --> 00:01:54,692
In fact, making the product
available to the user may

30
00:01:54,926 --> 00:01:58,651
involve a whole series of companies
and other organisations.

31
00:01:59,503 --> 00:02:03,565
Again, remember that each segment of
the chain is an activity that adds

32
00:02:03,775 --> 00:02:07,825
value to the customer and for the
various stakeholders involved.

33
00:02:08,523 --> 00:02:12,997
As we will see later, this is related
to the value proposition that will

34
00:02:13,184 --> 00:02:16,034
be created and provided to the
people who need it.

35
00:02:16,466 --> 00:02:20,204
Analysing the chain is vital and
there is a tight relation between

36
00:02:20,407 --> 00:02:22,182
each segment and the final product,

37
00:02:22,369 --> 00:02:25,132
as well as between one segment
and another.

38
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:29,643
What you see here is a generic and
basic form, which can be used as a

39
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:30,628
starting point.

40
00:02:30,838 --> 00:02:34,013
However, you will have to
expand it and tailor it to

41
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,945
your specific technology.

42
00:02:36,342 --> 00:02:40,054
Each activity should be further
subdivided into smaller segments,

43
00:02:40,267 --> 00:02:43,254
which will help you to identify
key suppliers, partners

44
00:02:43,454 --> 00:02:44,954
and other stakeholders.

45
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:49,113
So let's now have a quick overview
of this Product Value Chain before

46
00:02:49,328 --> 00:02:51,791
we take a deeper dive
into each segment. 

47
00:02:53,261 --> 00:02:56,073
Any technology or product
will first need to be

48
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:58,727
imagined, designed and developed.

49
00:02:59,432 --> 00:03:01,894
We thus naturally start
the Value Chain analysis

50
00:03:02,082 --> 00:03:03,282
with this segment.

51
00:03:03,867 --> 00:03:06,942
This early stage involves
creative thinking,

52
00:03:07,429 --> 00:03:10,891
but then concepts must be refined
and adjusted to the industrial

53
00:03:11,071 --> 00:03:14,558
constraints, the needs of the
customer, the legislations and

54
00:03:14,767 --> 00:03:17,580
many other factors that must
be accounted for.

55
00:03:18,727 --> 00:03:22,765
The aim of the Produce step is to
manufacture the product with

56
00:03:22,951 --> 00:03:27,551
a constant quality and at the cost
target that has been defined. 

57
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,490
Production methods need to be

58
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,580
tailored to the volumes
that will be needed,

59
00:03:32,844 --> 00:03:36,082
as our technology deployment
grows and scales up.

60
00:03:36,569 --> 00:03:41,682
This step does not only include own
manufacturing but also takes into

61
00:03:41,883 --> 00:03:45,858
consideration all kinds of
subcontracting types that you

62
00:03:46,063 --> 00:03:51,075
may put in place with partners to
reach the best price-quality ratio.

63
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:55,571
It also encompasses the supply chain
management required to manage

64
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:59,909
the flow of raw material,
components and semi-finished goods

65
00:04:00,383 --> 00:04:05,208
all along the production flow until
the product is finalised and tested.

66
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:09,360
The next one is the Market step.

67
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:13,442
The aim is to sell the product at
the right price, which means that

68
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:17,581
it has to be competitive on the
market while still offering a

69
00:04:17,801 --> 00:04:21,189
sustainable profitability to
your organisation.

70
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:28,414
We know that affordability is
a crucial concern as we think about

71
00:04:28,629 --> 00:04:31,629
solutions for low and middle
income countries.

72
00:04:32,647 --> 00:04:37,447
However, this step involves looking
at the complete value proposition

73
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:39,790
for customer, not just the product.

74
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:45,004
For example, alongside the product,
there may be a need for training

75
00:04:45,534 --> 00:04:47,972
which is part of the value
proposition.

76
00:04:49,094 --> 00:04:52,457
This step will also involve
market analysis, 

77
00:04:52,724 --> 00:04:57,536
business model definition, branding,
publicity and so forth.

78
00:04:57,961 --> 00:05:01,761
In a later chapter of this MOOC,
we will introduce a very effective

79
00:05:01,959 --> 00:05:05,096
tool to develop and analyse
innovative business models

80
00:05:05,284 --> 00:05:09,897
in detail, which is called the
Sustainable Business Model Canvas.

81
00:05:11,152 --> 00:05:15,377
A very important segment is related
to all the activities needed to

82
00:05:15,570 --> 00:05:20,595
bring the finished product from the
producer facility to the user.

83
00:05:20,795 --> 00:05:24,070
This is our Distribute segment.

84
00:05:24,531 --> 00:05:29,518
Distributing the product includes
topics such as packaging, logistics,

85
00:05:29,812 --> 00:05:32,675
customs clearance or insurances.

86
00:05:33,265 --> 00:05:37,702
This segment of the Value Chain
often represents a major roadblock/hurdle 

87
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,028
in the countries we are considering,

88
00:05:40,553 --> 00:05:45,915
for all sorts of reasons, such as
geography, climate or governance. 

89
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:50,573
Our final step is one that is,
unfortunately, often overlooked,

90
00:05:50,773 --> 00:05:54,323
especially when considering
deployment in low and middle

91
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:55,884
income countries.

92
00:05:56,353 --> 00:06:00,565
As we have seen, the level of
failure of products is huge when

93
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:04,498
they have originally been designed
for industrialised settings and

94
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:07,884
they are delivered to customers
in  developing countries without

95
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:09,465
any second thoughts.

96
00:06:10,385 --> 00:06:14,885
This is largely a consequence of
neglecting to investigate the context

97
00:06:15,097 --> 00:06:17,222
and behaviour of users.

98
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:23,909
The Support Use segment of the chain
is a vast subject starting from when

99
00:06:24,103 --> 00:06:28,252
a product is received by the
user all the way to when it is 

100
00:06:28,488 --> 00:06:30,850
decommissioned and recycled.

101
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:34,581
Note that the process is circular.

102
00:06:34,781 --> 00:06:39,194
This is because one day the product
will become obsolete and the

103
00:06:39,406 --> 00:06:42,281
whole cycle starts all over again.

104
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:46,681
I would like to make a few
additional general remarks

105
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:48,531
on this Product Value Chain.

106
00:06:49,048 --> 00:06:53,486
First, although it is shown as a
process with arrows linking the

107
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:56,052
different segments in a
chronological way, 

108
00:06:56,253 --> 00:07:00,615
it is essential to understand that
all the steps are interconnected.

109
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:04,577
They must all be taken into
consideration early on,

110
00:07:04,801 --> 00:07:07,801
even as we are just starting
to work on the concept. 

111
00:07:08,115 --> 00:07:11,427
For instance, when designing the
product, you will need to have

112
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:15,645
information about what options
are available for manufacturing,

113
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:19,607
about market requirements, 
distribution constraints and

114
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:24,293
about how it will be used,
maintained and recycled.

115
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:30,105
Second, what we have represented
here is a  Generic Value Chain,

116
00:07:30,326 --> 00:07:32,926
which should be used mainly
as a starting point.

117
00:07:33,659 --> 00:07:37,384
Your project could be to develop
any kind of technological products,

118
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:42,508
such as a new type of housing
technology, a machine, a drug

119
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:44,703
or an IT application.

120
00:07:44,903 --> 00:07:48,740
The Product Value Chain needs to
be tailored to this product and

121
00:07:48,955 --> 00:07:51,867
expanded in much more detail.

122
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:57,719
However, a fundamental rule is to
keep it as simple as possible

123
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:00,719
but not simpler, as
Einstein once said.

124
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:07,007
In some cases, not all steps will be
applicable, but it always makes sense

125
00:08:07,217 --> 00:08:11,542
to go through the Value Chain and
ask yourself if a specific step is

126
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,679
relevant to your product or not.

127
00:08:16,022 --> 00:08:19,797
Third, when beginning your
project, you will not have all the

128
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,710
information at hand. 

129
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:24,307
You will need to make assumptions.

130
00:08:24,917 --> 00:08:29,104
As your product gets more
mature, you will be able to confirm

131
00:08:29,317 --> 00:08:31,892
or refute these assumptions.

132
00:08:32,998 --> 00:08:37,397
You will also identify new,
relevant parameters that

133
00:08:37,604 --> 00:08:39,967
you did not consider at first. 

134
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,413
The Product Value Chain analysis,
like all of the tools proposed

135
00:08:45,636 --> 00:08:50,548
in this course, is intuitive and
must be reviewed regularly

136
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:52,908
all along your project.

137
00:08:53,985 --> 00:08:59,346
Fourth,  to successfully use this
tool, you need to use it as a team. 

138
00:08:59,556 --> 00:09:03,180
It is crucial to involve people
who have the knowledge

139
00:09:03,384 --> 00:09:04,883
that you may be missing.

140
00:09:05,081 --> 00:09:09,080
For example, if you are a marketer,
you may want to at least involve

141
00:09:09,274 --> 00:09:10,887
an engineer and so on.

142
00:09:12,242 --> 00:09:15,378
If you are someone from an
industrialised country, 

143
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:20,198
make sure to involve someone who
has a deep understanding of the

144
00:09:20,412 --> 00:09:24,075
country or region you are targeting.

145
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:29,668
In the next videos, we will move to
a more detailed discussion of the

146
00:09:29,876 --> 00:09:31,389
different segments.

147
00:09:32,515 --> 00:09:37,990
For each one, we will discuss some
key strategic topics to be aware of

148
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:42,702
and which are especially relevant
to low and middle income countries.

149
00:09:43,167 --> 00:09:44,654
Goodbye.
