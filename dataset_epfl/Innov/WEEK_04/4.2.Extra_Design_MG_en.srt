1
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:12,279
So the ambition to 
develop an African technology

2
00:00:12,476 --> 00:00:15,332
demands a wealth of strong
contributions.

3
00:00:15,575 --> 00:00:17,687
Firstly intellectual contributions

4
00:00:17,857 --> 00:00:20,482
even psychological contributions,
to claim:

5
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:22,703
"We are able to 
trust ourselves,

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,967
we are capable of 
developing our environment,

7
00:00:25,135 --> 00:00:27,825
we can be inspired by
what others have already done

8
00:00:28,088 --> 00:00:32,910
to better adapt it to our
own context."

9
00:00:33,385 --> 00:00:35,584
But nowadays I think

10
00:00:35,761 --> 00:00:38,512
all my energy goes to
telling Africans

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,381
it's still possible to do something,

12
00:00:40,564 --> 00:00:42,889
it is possible to bring
something to mankind,

13
00:00:43,113 --> 00:00:46,476
but we need a positive view,
more self confidence

14
00:00:46,689 --> 00:00:48,489
we need more trust,

15
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:53,545
more respect about the fact that 
we are an elite in this environment

16
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:55,573
that needs us,
that needs solutions,

17
00:00:55,753 --> 00:00:58,478
that needs innovations,
but firstly African innovations,

18
00:00:58,675 --> 00:00:59,924
we shouldn't think
straight away

19
00:01:00,115 --> 00:01:02,677
about innovating at an 
American scale,

20
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,883
at a Japanese scale,
at a Swiss scale.

21
00:01:05,076 --> 00:01:07,934
We should start with small
steps, like we say:

22
00:01:08,137 --> 00:01:10,887
"The longest trip
starts with the first step".

23
00:01:11,106 --> 00:01:13,656
Let's do the first step,
but in our own environment.

24
00:01:14,318 --> 00:01:17,906
As soon as we have competent
personnel

25
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:21,108
to ensure the use 
of health technology in Africa,

26
00:01:21,626 --> 00:01:25,001
we can improve the
situation, that gives me hope

27
00:01:25,471 --> 00:01:28,908
because the raw material is here

28
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:34,780
and if we also have the know-how
in human resources

29
00:01:35,322 --> 00:01:39,059
using this raw material is possible,

30
00:01:39,548 --> 00:01:44,641
so I have hope that the African
technology will evolve.

31
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:48,474
You see, there are 5 stages in
this process.

32
00:01:48,846 --> 00:01:51,984
The first one is drawing
what you see!

33
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:54,447
If you have seen something,
you should be able to draw it,

34
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:56,124
how does it work?
You have understood!

35
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:58,111
But now, do a 
drawing of it,

36
00:01:58,366 --> 00:02:01,078
then being able, truly from 
this drawing

37
00:02:01,278 --> 00:02:04,595
to bring an innovation,
improve something

38
00:02:04,855 --> 00:02:06,880
rather that it happening like that,
it will happen like this.

39
00:02:07,064 --> 00:02:10,102
and be able to test it,
IT tools exist for that.

40
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:13,368
Then be able to reproduce 
what you have thoroughly tested.

41
00:02:13,637 --> 00:02:16,053
You see! Be able to
reproduce and test it

42
00:02:16,757 --> 00:02:20,507
then put it into production.

43
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,937
There is a scheme here,

44
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:26,517
sometimes I feel like
we want to progress too quickly.

45
00:02:26,839 --> 00:02:29,464
But no! The world has existed
for billions of years

46
00:02:29,818 --> 00:02:32,543
and it is only as we see it today,

47
00:02:32,734 --> 00:02:35,897
so it should go slowly,
level by level,

48
00:02:36,096 --> 00:02:38,683
learn something
the methodical way

49
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:41,234
at that moment,
it is said somewhere

50
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:43,757
we will spend 6 days
creating the world.
