1
00:00:13,377 --> 00:00:15,149
If you want to buy an x-ray machine,

2
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:17,686
if you want to buy a dialysis machine,

3
00:00:17,911 --> 00:00:20,035
the first question you ask is

4
00:00:20,235 --> 00:00:22,163
in what conditions does it work?

5
00:00:23,786 --> 00:00:25,677
Because before ordering
the equipment,

6
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:26,860
you need to be sure

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,731
that we have the
right environment to use it,

8
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:31,059
to be adequate

9
00:00:33,019 --> 00:00:34,965
and it is not possible

10
00:00:35,165 --> 00:00:39,137
to arrive in this kind of hospital,

11
00:00:39,337 --> 00:00:40,752
this envrionment,

12
00:00:40,952 --> 00:00:42,528
you see a lot of cars parked

13
00:00:42,728 --> 00:00:44,144
because the x-ray machine is here,

14
00:00:44,785 --> 00:00:48,942
but it hasn't been 
working for a month.

15
00:00:51,383 --> 00:00:53,174
Because sometimes
even the planning

16
00:00:53,392 --> 00:00:55,226
for acquiring the equipment

17
00:00:55,426 --> 00:00:57,152
doesn't take into account

18
00:00:57,352 --> 00:00:58,247
these aspects,

19
00:00:58,447 --> 00:00:59,939
especially for big equipment.

20
00:01:00,139 --> 00:01:02,076
For example, 
now we have

21
00:01:02,276 --> 00:01:04,163
built the 
imaging centre,

22
00:01:04,363 --> 00:01:06,681
we have built the
hemodialysis centre

23
00:01:06,881 --> 00:01:09,083
we have a lot of 
other equipment

24
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:10,381
for example
for radiology,

25
00:01:10,081 --> 00:01:13,081


26
00:01:10,581 --> 00:01:12,379
they are quite 
heavy equipments

27
00:01:12,579 --> 00:01:14,042
that you really
need to plan

28
00:01:14,242 --> 00:01:16,160
before you order them

29
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:18,010
and for the functionality

30
00:01:18,231 --> 00:01:19,619
and to put the 
budget into place

31
00:01:19,831 --> 00:01:21,954
obtain for the 
health facility

32
00:01:22,154 --> 00:01:23,895
a competent
technicien

33
00:01:24,095 --> 00:01:26,773
to train us how
to use this equipment

34
00:01:26,973 --> 00:01:28,308
but, there's so many things

35
00:01:28,508 --> 00:01:30,586
that aren't taken into account
from the start.

36
00:01:30,786 --> 00:01:33,352
Where we were trained,

37
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,831
we usually have seen

38
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:37,127
installed equipment,

39
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:38,692
before it arrives,

40
00:01:38,892 --> 00:01:41,418
we had meetings

41
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:44,323
on what the machine does,

42
00:01:44,523 --> 00:01:47,964
the expected innovations
compared to the old machine,

43
00:01:48,164 --> 00:01:49,362
and very often,

44
00:01:49,562 --> 00:01:51,885
a service technician would go get training

45
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:55,508
somewhere where they
already had this machine,

46
00:01:55,708 --> 00:01:58,239
so that when the equipment
does arrive

47
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,852
there is at least one person

48
00:02:00,052 --> 00:02:02,927
who is familiar with it.

49
00:02:03,825 --> 00:02:04,416
Well.

50
00:02:04,616 --> 00:02:05,543
On top of that,

51
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:07,354
those who install, the technicians,

52
00:02:07,554 --> 00:02:11,461
whether it be in house
engineers,

53
00:02:11,661 --> 00:02:13,593
of the company
producing the machine

54
00:02:13,793 --> 00:02:15,519
or the application engineers,

55
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,839
they come first,

56
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:19,914
and have a meeting 
with the maintenance team

57
00:02:20,114 --> 00:02:22,352
and at the delivery,

58
00:02:22,552 --> 00:02:24,615
the two parties sign the document

59
00:02:25,903 --> 00:02:29,516
and the service that
must use the machine

60
00:02:29,716 --> 00:02:32,637
sign to say they have
understood how to use it

61
00:02:33,217 --> 00:02:35,617
and understood the
necessary precautions

62
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:38,022
for the optimal
functioning of the machine.

63
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:40,407
And only then

64
00:02:40,607 --> 00:02:42,883
the machine is considered
as commissionned.

65
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,066
Unfortunately here,

66
00:02:45,266 --> 00:02:46,616
what I have seen

67
00:02:46,816 --> 00:02:49,611
is, well I don't want 
to say the opposite

68
00:02:49,811 --> 00:02:51,507
to not be too 
extreme,

69
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:54,086
but was practically 
very rarely applied in this way.

70
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:57,338
Even when the 
equipment is bought,

71
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:00,908
for it's commissionning,
which usually

72
00:03:01,108 --> 00:03:04,403
means the supplier
has been contacted

73
00:03:05,217 --> 00:03:08,120
whether it be a dealer
or private operator,

74
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,735
whatever, he

75
00:03:10,726 --> 00:03:11,969
comes to the hospital,

76
00:03:12,642 --> 00:03:15,207
he just needs the 
administrative authorisation

77
00:03:15,407 --> 00:03:16,745
and he comes and 
installs the equipment. 

78
00:03:17,804 --> 00:03:20,693
What some of these
dealers or suppliers

79
00:03:20,893 --> 00:03:22,194
have done in the past,

80
00:03:22,394 --> 00:03:24,305
and that some still do,

81
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:28,531
is that the installation is 
managed like a state secret.

82
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:30,413
During the installation,

83
00:03:30,613 --> 00:03:31,675
the room is closed,

84
00:03:34,259 --> 00:03:36,549
none or very few precautions

85
00:03:36,749 --> 00:03:39,013
are taken to involve the personnel

86
00:03:39,213 --> 00:03:40,190
in the service, which would be essential

87
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,215
in order to understand the
entire process of the installation

88
00:03:43,415 --> 00:03:44,556
not on a technical level,

89
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:47,591
but at least the details we
will need in the future

90
00:03:47,791 --> 00:03:49,460
to use the equipment

91
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:52,340
or just to know when to call

92
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,081
in case of a preventive
maintenance alert.

93
00:03:55,894 --> 00:03:58,092
Sometimes the technical
manuals of the equipment

94
00:03:58,292 --> 00:04:00,788
aren't even left with us

95
00:04:00,988 --> 00:04:03,786
to be given to the bio-medical
engineers in case of a problem.

96
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,582
And sometimes,

97
00:04:08,258 --> 00:04:11,282
the training of the local 
engineer

98
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:12,491
when there is one,

99
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,121
which is stated in to the contract,

100
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:17,878
is not done

101
00:04:18,078 --> 00:04:19,951
because in principle
the dealer,

102
00:04:20,164 --> 00:04:21,535
when the contract
was properly negotiated,

103
00:04:21,735 --> 00:04:23,040
must leave the equipment

104
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,763
and also train someone

105
00:04:24,963 --> 00:04:26,182
for maintenance,

106
00:04:26,382 --> 00:04:27,970
and sometimes that is not done,

107
00:04:29,142 --> 00:04:31,477
so those are the elements

108
00:04:31,677 --> 00:04:34,448
that are a problem
with the commissioning.
