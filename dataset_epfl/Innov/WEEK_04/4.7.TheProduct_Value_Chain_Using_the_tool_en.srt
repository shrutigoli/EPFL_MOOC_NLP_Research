1
00:00:19,926 --> 00:00:20,439
Hello.

2
00:00:20,656 --> 00:00:22,957
In the previous videos we have seen

3
00:00:23,122 --> 00:00:24,897
the product value chain tool.

4
00:00:25,141 --> 00:00:26,979
Now, we would like to show you

5
00:00:27,151 --> 00:00:28,300
how it can be used

6
00:00:28,473 --> 00:00:29,611
in a specific project.

7
00:00:30,402 --> 00:00:31,552
To illustrate this,

8
00:00:31,718 --> 00:00:33,919
we will be using our case study

9
00:00:34,085 --> 00:00:35,498
of an x-ray system

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:37,421
designed for low-income contexts.

11
00:00:38,186 --> 00:00:40,512
Again, this tool must be used

12
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:42,931
as a basic guide to work in a team.

13
00:00:43,545 --> 00:00:45,158
Its goal is to help raise

14
00:00:45,332 --> 00:00:46,307
the right questions

15
00:00:46,481 --> 00:00:47,943
and to stimulate reflections

16
00:00:48,115 --> 00:00:49,602
so that we won’t be missing

17
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:50,617
crucial aspects

18
00:00:50,783 --> 00:00:52,497
as our project develops. 

19
00:00:53,016 --> 00:00:54,416
The first step is to adapt

20
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:56,114
our generic product value chain

21
00:00:56,295 --> 00:00:58,394
to the specific case of our project.

22
00:00:58,929 --> 00:01:00,779
Then, the tool can be used

23
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:02,186
to map stakeholders

24
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,825
as well as key opinion leaders

25
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:04,879
or KOLs

26
00:01:05,036 --> 00:01:06,698
which are particularly important

27
00:01:06,878 --> 00:01:08,216
in any project.

28
00:01:08,723 --> 00:01:10,947
We will see how to use this chain

29
00:01:11,127 --> 00:01:12,027
as a framework

30
00:01:12,209 --> 00:01:14,097
 to define specifications.

31
00:01:14,528 --> 00:01:15,215
Finally,

32
00:01:15,396 --> 00:01:16,847
 the tool will help us analyze

33
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,743
the total costs involved.

34
00:01:19,357 --> 00:01:21,333
As discussed, we start

35
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:23,620
with our generic product value chain

36
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,187
which we have seen

37
00:01:25,357 --> 00:01:26,945
in the previous videos.

38
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:29,229
The method is very simple.

39
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:31,044
We need to bring together

40
00:01:31,216 --> 00:01:33,467
a small group of knowledgeable people.

41
00:01:33,957 --> 00:01:34,969
For that purpose

42
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:36,228
the best is to harness

43
00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:37,255
our professional

44
00:01:37,423 --> 00:01:38,674
 and private networks.

45
00:01:39,186 --> 00:01:41,387
In our case, we look for people

46
00:01:41,567 --> 00:01:43,366
who know the context of Cameroon

47
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,978
as well as the market

48
00:01:45,149 --> 00:01:46,362
of diagnostic imaging.

49
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,985
Of course, we focus on Cameroon first

50
00:01:50,142 --> 00:01:51,592
but we keep in mind

51
00:01:51,772 --> 00:01:53,697
that we will want to expand

52
00:01:53,866 --> 00:01:56,317
on a much wider scale later. 

53
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:57,953
For this first step

54
00:01:58,112 --> 00:01:59,237
we need to pick people

55
00:01:59,401 --> 00:02:01,351
who each know something about

56
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:03,911
a specific segment of the chain.

57
00:02:04,586 --> 00:02:05,860
In our case, it includes

58
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:07,541
a Cameroonian radiologist

59
00:02:07,715 --> 00:02:09,553
as well as an engineer

60
00:02:09,709 --> 00:02:10,996
who knows the technology

61
00:02:11,165 --> 00:02:12,501
of diagnostic imaging.

62
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:14,635
We include one person

63
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,913
who know the market

64
00:02:16,031 --> 00:02:17,955
of diagnostic imaging devices

65
00:02:18,123 --> 00:02:19,636
and one person who knows

66
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:20,773
practical aspects

67
00:02:20,928 --> 00:02:22,379
of shipping and logistics.

68
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:23,924
And finally,

69
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:26,570
we also include a radiographer

70
00:02:26,868 --> 00:02:28,030
who as you remember,

71
00:02:28,196 --> 00:02:29,371
are the main users

72
00:02:29,545 --> 00:02:31,220
of radiology machines.

73
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:33,803
This initial selection of people

74
00:02:33,983 --> 00:02:36,159
will help us make the next step

75
00:02:36,316 --> 00:02:37,404
which is to expand

76
00:02:37,585 --> 00:02:38,560
the value chain

77
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:40,106
into something more specific

78
00:02:40,271 --> 00:02:42,184
to the domain of radiology.

79
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:44,459
Of course, you may find it hard

80
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,056
to assemble the right

81
00:02:46,217 --> 00:02:47,117
the ideal team

82
00:02:47,299 --> 00:02:49,074
and there will certainly be

83
00:02:49,229 --> 00:02:50,653
some knowledge gaps.

84
00:02:50,896 --> 00:02:52,321
This is perfectly okay

85
00:02:52,494 --> 00:02:54,518
as discovering those gaps

86
00:02:54,693 --> 00:02:56,930
is already an important deliverable

87
00:02:57,103 --> 00:02:59,103
at this level of the process.

88
00:02:59,517 --> 00:03:01,692
At this stage we must resist

89
00:03:01,869 --> 00:03:03,607
getting lost in details

90
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:06,645
about how things will be implemented.

91
00:03:07,486 --> 00:03:09,948
The only objective is to identify

92
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,632
main segments of the chain

93
00:03:11,802 --> 00:03:12,677
and to come up

94
00:03:12,852 --> 00:03:14,126
with a more specific

95
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:16,010
but still quite general

96
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,003
value chain for our product.

97
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:19,401
We must resist

98
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,973
the natural tendency

99
00:03:21,135 --> 00:03:23,110
to make things more complex

100
00:03:23,276 --> 00:03:25,113
than they need to be. 

101
00:03:25,931 --> 00:03:28,093
Here is our product’s specific value chain

102
00:03:28,263 --> 00:03:30,663
for the diagnostic x-ray system.

103
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:31,711
As you can see

104
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,757
there are now 12 segments

105
00:03:33,929 --> 00:03:34,779
instead of 5

106
00:03:34,931 --> 00:03:36,680
which is not that many.

107
00:03:36,858 --> 00:03:39,258
In spite of its relative simplicity

108
00:03:39,418 --> 00:03:40,481
it allows to highlight

109
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:42,136
crucially important elements

110
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:44,328
as well as their sequence.

111
00:03:44,494 --> 00:03:46,744
First, the team has decided

112
00:03:46,928 --> 00:03:48,140
that the different parts

113
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,549
of the x-ray system

114
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,922
needed to be produced

115
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,118
outside of Cameroon

116
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,415
as there are little possibilities

117
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:56,245
for local manufacturing.

118
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:57,694
They are then shipped

119
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:58,764
to a warehouse

120
00:03:58,919 --> 00:04:02,043
until the sales transaction is finalized.

121
00:04:02,257 --> 00:04:04,382
The system being quite bulky,

122
00:04:04,561 --> 00:04:06,361
it will then need to be assembled

123
00:04:06,526 --> 00:04:08,351
close to where the customer is.

124
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:10,707
If we continue to follow the chain,

125
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:11,579
the product

126
00:04:11,742 --> 00:04:13,318
will the need to be controlled

127
00:04:13,448 --> 00:04:14,286
to assure

128
00:04:14,390 --> 00:04:16,002
that it is in perfect condition

129
00:04:16,167 --> 00:04:18,717
before it can be put into service.

130
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:20,210
Then, the device

131
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:21,778
will need to be formally commissioned

132
00:04:21,945 --> 00:04:23,321
at the customer site,

133
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,863
which is a district hospital for instance,

134
00:04:26,017 --> 00:04:27,642
where infrastructure

135
00:04:27,799 --> 00:04:29,185
needs to be prepared.

136
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:30,839
As we have seen,

137
00:04:31,022 --> 00:04:32,473
diagnostic imaging involves

138
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:34,186
ionizing radiation

139
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,032
and quite a bit of know-how

140
00:04:36,204 --> 00:04:38,404
to properly operate the system.

141
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:40,792
This is the reason why training

142
00:04:40,938 --> 00:04:41,963
was given such

143
00:04:42,133 --> 00:04:44,420
 a specific importance here.

144
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:47,854
Then of course we have all aspects

145
00:04:48,034 --> 00:04:49,748
related to how the system

146
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,130
 is being used, maintained

147
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:54,905
repaired, and recycled

148
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,339
at the end of its useful life.

149
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,554
Note that the process is circular

150
00:05:00,762 --> 00:05:02,024
and that we need to consider

151
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:03,515
technology reengineering.

152
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:04,344
For example,

153
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,987
to deal with obsolescence

154
00:05:06,165 --> 00:05:08,315
of components or to develop

155
00:05:08,484 --> 00:05:09,946
software upgrades.

156
00:05:10,434 --> 00:05:12,658
As you can see this is still

157
00:05:12,828 --> 00:05:14,728
a quite heavily simplified vision

158
00:05:14,900 --> 00:05:15,562
of how things

159
00:05:15,738 --> 00:05:17,300
will be working in reality. 

160
00:05:17,465 --> 00:05:19,140
However, it allows us

161
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:20,872
to go one step further

162
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:23,848
and to identify stakeholders.

163
00:05:24,496 --> 00:05:25,858
As a quick reminder,

164
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:27,819
stakeholders are people,

165
00:05:27,984 --> 00:05:29,772
companies, or other entities

166
00:05:29,935 --> 00:05:31,222
who can affect the outcome

167
00:05:31,388 --> 00:05:32,250
of our project

168
00:05:32,407 --> 00:05:35,631
or our potentially affected by it.

169
00:05:35,812 --> 00:05:37,112
It is very important

170
00:05:37,282 --> 00:05:38,707
to identify them early on

171
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:40,770
because they are crucially important

172
00:05:40,904 --> 00:05:42,266
for the success of the project.

173
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:43,986
Some of them

174
00:05:44,157 --> 00:05:45,732
will be especially important

175
00:05:45,899 --> 00:05:47,837
for the uptake of the technology

176
00:05:47,992 --> 00:05:49,341
once it is available.

177
00:05:49,507 --> 00:05:50,770
Their opinions

178
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:52,245
are widely respected

179
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,534
and they will be involved

180
00:05:53,642 --> 00:05:55,905
in important decision-making processes

181
00:05:56,084 --> 00:05:57,559
such as the decision

182
00:05:57,729 --> 00:05:59,491
 to acquire our product.

183
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:00,371
In industry,

184
00:06:00,548 --> 00:06:02,785
this specific group of stakeholders

185
00:06:02,959 --> 00:06:05,258
is called Key Opinion Leaders.

186
00:06:06,043 --> 00:06:08,219
It is of outmost importance

187
00:06:08,385 --> 00:06:10,685
to integrate them into our project

188
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:12,349
right from the start.

189
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,246
Our product value chain 

190
00:06:14,414 --> 00:06:16,139
can be used as a framework

191
00:06:16,314 --> 00:06:19,089
to map these stakeholders.

192
00:06:20,141 --> 00:06:20,829
Again,

193
00:06:20,984 --> 00:06:22,609
this needs to be done as a team.

194
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,973
For each segment the project team

195
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,230
needs to determine

196
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,303
who are the key players.

197
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,429
In our case,

198
00:06:29,597 --> 00:06:30,846
the following stakeholders

199
00:06:31,017 --> 00:06:32,492
have been identified.

200
00:06:33,029 --> 00:06:34,579
For the engineering part,

201
00:06:34,756 --> 00:06:36,368
since the team has decided

202
00:06:36,538 --> 00:06:37,812
to restart from scratch,

203
00:06:37,972 --> 00:06:40,172
it has identified several groups

204
00:06:40,346 --> 00:06:41,447
at engineering schools

205
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:43,599
which are working on the design

206
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,015
and development of x-ray technology.

207
00:06:46,178 --> 00:06:47,466
For manufacturing,

208
00:06:47,633 --> 00:06:48,984
the team has identified

209
00:06:49,149 --> 00:06:50,885
an x-ray manufacturer

210
00:06:51,056 --> 00:06:52,669
who already has experience

211
00:06:52,822 --> 00:06:54,472
in particular for the high voltage

212
00:06:54,619 --> 00:06:55,857
electronic parts.

213
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:57,784
For logistics,

214
00:06:57,937 --> 00:06:59,100
the team has decided

215
00:06:59,262 --> 00:07:00,787
that a freight forwarding expert

216
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,012
should be involved.

217
00:07:02,184 --> 00:07:03,734
A company was identified

218
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:05,351
which has experience

219
00:07:05,511 --> 00:07:07,624
with shipping to Cameroon.

220
00:07:07,983 --> 00:07:09,445
For sales and marketing,

221
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:10,890
the team has determined

222
00:07:11,046 --> 00:07:12,522
that the main customer

223
00:07:12,653 --> 00:07:13,903
or buyer of the device

224
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:16,350
is the Cameroonian government.

225
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:17,995
Since x-ray systems

226
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,913
are considered capital equipment,

227
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:21,388
the Ministry of Health

228
00:07:21,557 --> 00:07:24,469
usually issues Call for Tenders.

229
00:07:25,013 --> 00:07:26,850
There are other stakeholders

230
00:07:27,023 --> 00:07:28,298
such as NGO’s

231
00:07:28,474 --> 00:07:29,875
and private hospital chains

232
00:07:30,049 --> 00:07:30,986
is also involved.

233
00:07:31,157 --> 00:07:32,782
NGO’s can be seen

234
00:07:32,953 --> 00:07:34,341
as a potential customer

235
00:07:34,504 --> 00:07:36,304
or even as a competitor

236
00:07:36,481 --> 00:07:38,506
if they focus on donating

237
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,338
medical equipment

238
00:07:39,502 --> 00:07:40,989
which as we have seen

239
00:07:41,149 --> 00:07:43,311
is generally not sustainable.

240
00:07:43,794 --> 00:07:45,045
For assembly,

241
00:07:45,226 --> 00:07:47,076
there is a need to understand

242
00:07:47,242 --> 00:07:48,604
the local tax rules

243
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,308
to determine and how far

244
00:07:50,486 --> 00:07:51,423
local assembly

245
00:07:51,525 --> 00:07:53,113
can help reduce taxes.

246
00:07:53,285 --> 00:07:54,635
Customs are obviously

247
00:07:54,748 --> 00:07:57,085
a key stakeholder in this regards

248
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:59,218
As far as controlling,

249
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:00,919
the team has found out

250
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:02,492
that Cameroon

251
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:05,261
has a radio protection agency

252
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:06,731
which is a crucially

253
00:08:06,915 --> 00:08:08,715
important local stakeholder

254
00:08:08,884 --> 00:08:11,522
as it delivers the authorization

255
00:08:11,688 --> 00:08:13,688
to sell and to operate

256
00:08:13,859 --> 00:08:16,034
the technology in hospitals.

257
00:08:16,414 --> 00:08:17,652
For commissioning,

258
00:08:17,824 --> 00:08:19,523
local biochemical engineers

259
00:08:19,684 --> 00:08:20,659
and hospital staff

260
00:08:20,825 --> 00:08:22,087
in district hospitals

261
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:23,064
are important

262
00:08:23,177 --> 00:08:25,227
because they will need to prepare

263
00:08:25,369 --> 00:08:27,780
the facility and infrastructure.

264
00:08:27,955 --> 00:08:28,955
For training,

265
00:08:29,132 --> 00:08:30,469
the team has identified

266
00:08:30,645 --> 00:08:31,607
a local school

267
00:08:31,787 --> 00:08:34,362
which trains radiographers.

268
00:08:34,946 --> 00:08:36,821
The head of the diagnostic

269
00:08:36,977 --> 00:08:37,978
imaging department

270
00:08:38,149 --> 00:08:40,149
of the main university hospital

271
00:08:40,257 --> 00:08:41,019
in Cameroon

272
00:08:41,197 --> 00:08:43,160
has also been identified

273
00:08:43,338 --> 00:08:46,438
to be an important stakeholder.

274
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,102
As a professor,

275
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:50,513
he not only train radiologists

276
00:08:50,684 --> 00:08:52,510
but he also

277
00:08:52,677 --> 00:08:55,326
is a reputable key opinion leader

278
00:08:55,433 --> 00:08:56,372
on this subject

279
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:58,104
for the whole country.

280
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,331
For the use of the technology,

281
00:09:00,487 --> 00:09:01,612
there is a local

282
00:09:01,781 --> 00:09:02,918
professional association

283
00:09:03,117 --> 00:09:05,542
of Cameroonian radiographers

284
00:09:05,706 --> 00:09:08,468
and also since the x-ray system

285
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:09,985
is intended to be deployed

286
00:09:10,152 --> 00:09:11,514
in district hospitals,

287
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,706
the chief medical officers

288
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:16,722
or CMO’s of such hospitals

289
00:09:16,886 --> 00:09:19,786
are highly important stakeholders.

290
00:09:20,003 --> 00:09:21,565
They know the problems

291
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:22,996
faced by their staff

292
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:24,528
on a daily basis.

293
00:09:24,754 --> 00:09:27,754
Finally, it is obvious that patients

294
00:09:27,927 --> 00:09:30,314
represent a crucial stakeholder group.

295
00:09:30,476 --> 00:09:32,214
Think for example what would happen

296
00:09:32,397 --> 00:09:34,497
if we developed some technology

297
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:35,798
which looked scary

298
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:37,779
or dangerous to them?

299
00:09:38,187 --> 00:09:39,637
As we have seen,

300
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:41,211
maintenance and repair

301
00:09:41,378 --> 00:09:42,929
are absolutely essential

302
00:09:43,037 --> 00:09:44,175
in this project

303
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:46,877
and in the context all together.

304
00:09:47,136 --> 00:09:47,823
This is why

305
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,577
the maintenance staff available

306
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:51,118
in district hospitals

307
00:09:51,274 --> 00:09:53,737
is a very important group.

308
00:09:53,903 --> 00:09:56,291
Again, the radio protection agency

309
00:09:56,457 --> 00:09:57,395
is important here

310
00:09:57,559 --> 00:10:00,246
because it enforces legislation 

311
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:01,614
regarding calibration,

312
00:10:01,771 --> 00:10:03,634
maintenance, and repair.

313
00:10:04,021 --> 00:10:06,196
Finally for recycling,

314
00:10:06,937 --> 00:10:08,649
since there are potentially

315
00:10:08,805 --> 00:10:10,356
toxic components involved

316
00:10:10,538 --> 00:10:11,751
such as the oil

317
00:10:11,908 --> 00:10:13,520
in the high voltage transformer,

318
00:10:13,686 --> 00:10:14,923
the manufacturers’

319
00:10:15,092 --> 00:10:17,330
of those specific components

320
00:10:17,486 --> 00:10:20,349
are important in this regards.

321
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:21,070
Of course,

322
00:10:21,243 --> 00:10:23,168
there are many more stakeholders

323
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,668
which we will discover

324
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,939
as we repeat the exercise later

325
00:10:27,103 --> 00:10:27,953
in the process

326
00:10:28,117 --> 00:10:29,880
and with different people.

327
00:10:30,084 --> 00:10:31,834
However, as you can see

328
00:10:31,993 --> 00:10:34,218
this very crude first approach

329
00:10:34,378 --> 00:10:36,291
allowed us to identify

330
00:10:36,457 --> 00:10:38,145
and map some key players.

331
00:10:38,495 --> 00:10:40,582
We can now try to better understand

332
00:10:40,746 --> 00:10:43,097
the influence that each one of them

333
00:10:43,255 --> 00:10:45,606
could have on our project.

334
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:48,410
For this purpose it is interesting

335
00:10:48,563 --> 00:10:49,751
to create a table

336
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,820
which allows to classify them

337
00:10:51,994 --> 00:10:53,332
for their importance.

338
00:10:53,607 --> 00:10:56,058
An example of such a table is given here.

339
00:10:56,282 --> 00:10:58,995
It is useful to rate the stakeholder

340
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:01,934
in function of the level of interest

341
00:11:02,103 --> 00:11:03,741
he has in the activity.

342
00:11:04,217 --> 00:11:05,292
We need to remember

343
00:11:05,468 --> 00:11:06,642
that the value chain

344
00:11:06,814 --> 00:11:08,952
is not only about providing value

345
00:11:09,116 --> 00:11:10,579
to the user,

346
00:11:10,898 --> 00:11:12,648
every stakeholder involved

347
00:11:12,824 --> 00:11:15,824
will only facilitate the activity

348
00:11:15,995 --> 00:11:18,720
if he perceives some value

349
00:11:18,881 --> 00:11:20,595
for himself as well.

350
00:11:20,863 --> 00:11:22,788
The key question to remember is

351
00:11:22,962 --> 00:11:24,662
what’s in it for him?

352
00:11:24,899 --> 00:11:26,711
The second important aspect

353
00:11:26,877 --> 00:11:30,039
is the power that the stakeholder has.

354
00:11:30,593 --> 00:11:32,856
In our example here, the radiation

355
00:11:32,969 --> 00:11:34,944
protection agency’s interests

356
00:11:35,114 --> 00:11:36,402
could be to participate

357
00:11:36,558 --> 00:11:38,370
in an international project

358
00:11:38,546 --> 00:11:41,045
which could increase its reputation.

359
00:11:41,215 --> 00:11:42,239
On the other hand,

360
00:11:42,405 --> 00:11:43,492
it has the power

361
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:45,876
to prevent the sale of the product.

362
00:11:46,142 --> 00:11:48,116
This stakeholder, thus,

363
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:50,005
has maximum power

364
00:11:50,176 --> 00:11:52,001
but only little interest

365
00:11:52,171 --> 00:11:53,371
which may represent

366
00:11:53,535 --> 00:11:55,248
a problem for our project.

367
00:11:55,488 --> 00:11:56,874
This should lead us

368
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:58,224
to apply special care

369
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:01,077
to assure that this stakeholder

370
00:12:01,245 --> 00:12:02,595
will stay on board.

371
00:12:02,909 --> 00:12:04,108
The last column

372
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:05,718
 is what the stakeholder

373
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,551
is concerned about.

374
00:12:07,818 --> 00:12:09,443
In our second example,

375
00:12:09,598 --> 00:12:11,024
a chief medical officer

376
00:12:11,198 --> 00:12:12,223
in a district hospital

377
00:12:12,386 --> 00:12:14,174
will certainly find it great

378
00:12:14,343 --> 00:12:16,119
to have a digital system

379
00:12:16,271 --> 00:12:18,409
providing good quality images.

380
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:20,096
However, what happens

381
00:12:20,269 --> 00:12:21,533
if he is confronted

382
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:23,097
with a new supplier

383
00:12:23,267 --> 00:12:25,180
without a well-known brand?

384
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,922
How can he be sure

385
00:12:27,087 --> 00:12:28,224
that the product

386
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:30,202
will deliver its promises?

387
00:12:30,521 --> 00:12:31,333
As you can see,

388
00:12:31,496 --> 00:12:33,708
this simple first step

389
00:12:33,858 --> 00:12:35,071
beyond the generic

390
00:12:35,238 --> 00:12:36,187
product value chain

391
00:12:36,351 --> 00:12:37,288
has allowed us

392
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,494
to identify key stakeholders

393
00:12:39,658 --> 00:12:40,533
and to explore

394
00:12:40,705 --> 00:12:42,643
what their potential influence

395
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,756
could be in our project.

396
00:12:44,977 --> 00:12:47,015
Of course, this is only

397
00:12:47,182 --> 00:12:49,657
a first step and it is important

398
00:12:49,829 --> 00:12:51,992
to review our stakeholder map

399
00:12:52,152 --> 00:12:53,914
on a regular basis.

400
00:12:54,107 --> 00:12:55,457
This needs to be done

401
00:12:55,539 --> 00:12:57,114
as a team involving people

402
00:12:57,265 --> 00:12:59,666
who have a deep knowledge

403
00:12:59,827 --> 00:13:02,490
of the different stakeholder groups,

404
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:05,464
if not, with representatives

405
00:13:05,619 --> 00:13:07,745
of the groups themselves.

406
00:13:08,139 --> 00:13:09,364
Yet another use

407
00:13:09,510 --> 00:13:10,560
of this value chain

408
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:13,779
is to identify product specifications.

409
00:13:13,966 --> 00:13:15,241
As a good start,

410
00:13:15,415 --> 00:13:16,864
we can create a document

411
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,849
based on the specific segments

412
00:13:19,017 --> 00:13:19,818
of the chain.

413
00:13:19,976 --> 00:13:20,564
For example,

414
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:22,943
if we look at the logistic segment

415
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:24,701
we realize that we need

416
00:13:24,836 --> 00:13:25,924
to define the conditions

417
00:13:26,087 --> 00:13:28,013
of transport of our technology

418
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,054
such as maximum temperatures,

419
00:13:30,219 --> 00:13:31,808
vibrations, and shocks.

420
00:13:32,277 --> 00:13:33,640
As another example,

421
00:13:33,801 --> 00:13:35,427
let’s take training.

422
00:13:35,592 --> 00:13:37,005
We need to specify

423
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,504
what the average level of training

424
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,918
of the users will be

425
00:13:41,094 --> 00:13:43,907
since this has important consequences.

426
00:13:44,076 --> 00:13:46,514
For example on how the user interface

427
00:13:46,673 --> 00:13:47,747
will be designed.

428
00:13:47,922 --> 00:13:48,972
On the other hand,

429
00:13:49,142 --> 00:13:50,706
it can lead us to specify

430
00:13:50,864 --> 00:13:52,202
that user software

431
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:54,187
needs to involve a tutorial

432
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:55,546
that will help bring

433
00:13:55,707 --> 00:13:57,570
a new user up to speed.

434
00:13:58,593 --> 00:13:59,380
Of course,

435
00:13:59,556 --> 00:14:01,419
the functional specifications

436
00:14:01,573 --> 00:14:03,235
related to user expectations

437
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,628
are of core importance.

438
00:14:04,802 --> 00:14:05,428
For example,

439
00:14:05,587 --> 00:14:06,912
how many images

440
00:14:07,091 --> 00:14:08,304
will be made per day?

441
00:14:08,461 --> 00:14:10,775
What is the required image resolution?

442
00:14:10,939 --> 00:14:12,576
Or what are the maximum

443
00:14:12,743 --> 00:14:14,556
exposure parameters?

444
00:14:14,985 --> 00:14:16,484
As yet another example,

445
00:14:16,654 --> 00:14:18,068
we need to specify the amount

446
00:14:18,228 --> 00:14:19,667
of maintenance capability

447
00:14:19,834 --> 00:14:22,572
which can be asked from the user.

448
00:14:22,836 --> 00:14:24,686
Can we expect that the user

449
00:14:24,853 --> 00:14:26,965
will be doing annual calibration

450
00:14:27,138 --> 00:14:28,738
of the imaging detector?

451
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,979
Is there any material involved

452
00:14:31,145 --> 00:14:32,733
or calibration tools?

453
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:34,092
In the x-ray project

454
00:14:34,253 --> 00:14:35,103
it was determined

455
00:14:35,272 --> 00:14:36,747
that it could not be expected

456
00:14:36,902 --> 00:14:37,903
that any maintenance

457
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:39,189
beyond simple cleaning

458
00:14:39,354 --> 00:14:41,517
will be done and the cleaning itself

459
00:14:41,689 --> 00:14:42,965
may involve aggressive

460
00:14:43,132 --> 00:14:45,132
chemicals such as bleach.

461
00:14:45,368 --> 00:14:47,181
These specifications

462
00:14:47,364 --> 00:14:48,777
are crucially important

463
00:14:48,948 --> 00:14:50,223
as they determine

464
00:14:50,385 --> 00:14:51,697
the product development

465
00:14:51,865 --> 00:14:54,966
and the business model strategy.

466
00:14:55,304 --> 00:14:55,955
Finally,

467
00:14:56,127 --> 00:14:57,626
we need to plug financial figures

468
00:14:57,789 --> 00:14:58,790
into every segment.

469
00:14:58,948 --> 00:14:59,736
For example,

470
00:14:59,906 --> 00:15:01,693
how much would it cost to manufacture

471
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:03,444
or transport the devices?

472
00:15:03,835 --> 00:15:04,547
At first 

473
00:15:04,706 --> 00:15:06,769
it will only be a rough estimate

474
00:15:06,935 --> 00:15:08,672
based mainly on discussions

475
00:15:08,832 --> 00:15:09,795
with stakeholders

476
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:12,020
and we will refine the analysis

477
00:15:12,171 --> 00:15:13,571
as we progress.

478
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:15,054
For each segment

479
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:16,803
we need to clearly distinguish

480
00:15:16,966 --> 00:15:18,166
two perspectives,

481
00:15:18,343 --> 00:15:19,506
the cost perspective

482
00:15:19,688 --> 00:15:21,588
and the price perspective.

483
00:15:21,759 --> 00:15:22,460
For example,

484
00:15:22,624 --> 00:15:24,661
let’s take the training segment.

485
00:15:25,015 --> 00:15:25,928
If we assume

486
00:15:26,097 --> 00:15:29,572
that we subcontract the training

487
00:15:29,723 --> 00:15:31,535
we will have to determine the price.

488
00:15:31,715 --> 00:15:33,153
We would have to pay

489
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,244
to some local company

490
00:15:35,425 --> 00:15:37,476
which would then provide the training.

491
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:38,693
On the other hand,

492
00:15:38,864 --> 00:15:41,227
if we decide that we as a company

493
00:15:41,397 --> 00:15:43,460
will assure the training ourselves,

494
00:15:43,631 --> 00:15:44,780
then we need to determine

495
00:15:44,883 --> 00:15:46,196
how much it would cost us

496
00:15:46,369 --> 00:15:47,832
in salaries for the trainer

497
00:15:47,990 --> 00:15:50,529
to send them to the hospitals, etc.

498
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:52,332
For each segment

499
00:15:52,501 --> 00:15:55,114
this will lead us to reflect about

500
00:15:55,276 --> 00:15:57,389
whether we should pay a partner

501
00:15:57,521 --> 00:15:58,471
to do the work

502
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:00,015
or if we should vertically

503
00:16:00,183 --> 00:16:01,372
integrate these tasks

504
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:03,945
into our company. The difference

505
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:05,747
is not only strategic

506
00:16:05,925 --> 00:16:07,287
because we would need to find

507
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:08,290
a reliable partner

508
00:16:08,452 --> 00:16:09,527
but also financial

509
00:16:09,697 --> 00:16:11,059
since that partner

510
00:16:11,232 --> 00:16:13,533
will want to have a profit margin.

511
00:16:14,002 --> 00:16:16,227
The influence of this decision

512
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:17,825
is extremely important

513
00:16:17,981 --> 00:16:20,043
as it will determine how profitable

514
00:16:20,202 --> 00:16:21,364
and how sustainable

515
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:22,907
our company will be.

516
00:16:23,114 --> 00:16:25,414
Finally, we can also look at

517
00:16:25,588 --> 00:16:26,376
the value chain

518
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:28,793
from the perspective of the buyer.

519
00:16:28,991 --> 00:16:30,816
This will allow us to come up

520
00:16:30,992 --> 00:16:33,068
with an estimate of what is called

521
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:35,722
the Total Cost of Ownership.

522
00:16:36,114 --> 00:16:38,315
In the case of x-rays,

523
00:16:38,512 --> 00:16:41,100
for example moving away from films

524
00:16:41,269 --> 00:16:43,358
and choosing a digital technology

525
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:46,194
allows to drastically reduce cause

526
00:16:46,376 --> 00:16:47,564
of ownership

527
00:16:47,744 --> 00:16:49,919
in the perspective of the hospital.

528
00:16:50,194 --> 00:16:52,606
Indeed, films are expensive

529
00:16:52,783 --> 00:16:55,783
and have a limited shelf life, etc.

530
00:16:56,322 --> 00:16:58,434
In the next chapter of this MOOC,

531
00:16:58,597 --> 00:17:00,761
we will look at our third tool

532
00:17:00,927 --> 00:17:02,764
which allows to analyze

533
00:17:02,883 --> 00:17:04,409
the company’s business model

534
00:17:04,571 --> 00:17:06,547
in order to find the right balance

535
00:17:06,718 --> 00:17:08,931
between cost and revenues.

536
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:11,744
For now, the product value chain

537
00:17:11,908 --> 00:17:13,346
mainly allows to identify

538
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,796
the cost involved.

539
00:17:15,018 --> 00:17:16,368
I hope you are now convinced

540
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:18,312
of the power of this tool.

541
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:20,046
I encourage you to use it

542
00:17:20,108 --> 00:17:21,470
as often as possible

543
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:23,611
to improve your understanding

544
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:26,390
as you progress in your project.

545
00:17:26,637 --> 00:17:28,100
Goodbye.
