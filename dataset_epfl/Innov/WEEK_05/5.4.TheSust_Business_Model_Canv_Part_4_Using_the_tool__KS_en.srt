1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:04,085


2
00:00:20,037 --> 00:00:23,925
Hello. As with the previous tools
presented in this MOOC,

3
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:27,262
we will now see how the sustainable
business model canvas

4
00:00:27,462 --> 00:00:31,162
applies to our example of a
diagnostic x-ray system.

5
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:34,258
Of course. For the sake of
simplicity

6
00:00:34,458 --> 00:00:37,458
we can only address things partially
in this video, 

7
00:00:37,658 --> 00:00:41,521
and we can't explain the complete
business model in such a short time.

8
00:00:42,147 --> 00:00:45,572
In this sense, and although 
the project is a real one,

9
00:00:45,772 --> 00:00:48,235
and the company has effectively
been created, 

10
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:52,122
this should only be considered
as a simplified example

11
00:00:52,322 --> 00:00:54,672
inspired from the real case.

12
00:00:55,385 --> 00:00:57,610
Our goal is to give
you a feel

13
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,410
of how this tool is applied
in practice.

14
00:01:00,921 --> 00:01:05,421
As we have seen, when applying
the impact canvas to this example,

15
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:09,065
out impact target is to reduce
the mortality,

16
00:01:09,265 --> 00:01:11,903
and morbidity, resulting from trauma

17
00:01:12,168 --> 00:01:14,630
or from pulmonary diseases.

18
00:01:15,151 --> 00:01:17,501
The beneficiaries of this technology

19
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:20,389
are of course, the patients
themselves, 

20
00:01:20,965 --> 00:01:23,152
since a pertinent diagnosis

21
00:01:23,352 --> 00:01:26,490
would allow them to receive
a more adequate treatment,

22
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:28,965
and not suffer
from complications.

23
00:01:29,825 --> 00:01:33,000
As for the fundamental need
addressed, in this case,

24
00:01:33,369 --> 00:01:36,132
it is access to quality health care,

25
00:01:36,332 --> 00:01:39,557
and in particular, to adequate
x-ray diagnosis.

26
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:42,929
Let us now get back to the canvas.

27
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:46,854
You can see the targeted impact
and beneficiary needs

28
00:01:47,054 --> 00:01:50,054
pasted on the canvas
as sticky notes

29
00:01:50,254 --> 00:01:51,954
with keywords only.

30
00:01:52,154 --> 00:01:54,654
This is really the way to use
this canvas.

31
00:01:54,854 --> 00:01:57,854
Print it as a poster,
hang it on the wall,

32
00:01:58,054 --> 00:02:01,591
and start adding sticky notes
as ideas shoot up

33
00:02:01,791 --> 00:02:03,829
from you and your colleagues. 

34
00:02:04,149 --> 00:02:07,149
One of the first questions
you need to ask yourselves

35
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:11,811
is, what is your company's mission?
and what are the common values

36
00:02:12,024 --> 00:02:14,574
shared by you and you team mates?

37
00:02:14,774 --> 00:02:16,899
Here, the mission of
the company

38
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,349
is to provide robust and
affordable medical devices

39
00:02:20,549 --> 00:02:23,337
for the global market, and 
especially for emerging

40
00:02:23,537 --> 00:02:25,212
and developing countries.

41
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:27,474
Note that this mission statement

42
00:02:27,674 --> 00:02:31,012
implies that the company may
sell other devices,

43
00:02:31,212 --> 00:02:33,449
not just x-ray systems.

44
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:36,228
Values are very personal

45
00:02:36,428 --> 00:02:40,078
and yet some of them must be
shared within your team.

46
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,360
This will for example lead to 
an agreement 

47
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:46,648
on how the company's profit
should be used.

48
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:50,050
Here the team decided that
part of the profit

49
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,975
would be constantly reinvested
in pursuit of the company mission.

50
00:02:54,724 --> 00:02:57,849
The team also agreed on
the type of investors

51
00:02:58,049 --> 00:03:01,261
they would like to partner with,
which are impact investors.

52
00:03:01,632 --> 00:03:05,332
Finally, the team also agreed that
they did not want

53
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:08,820
a short term sale 
of the company, or exit.,

54
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,020
at least not before
break-even was reached.

55
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,307
A first customer segment for
this machine is

56
00:03:16,507 --> 00:03:18,945
the Ministry of Health
of the targeted country,

57
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:20,670
which is Cameroon.

58
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:25,157
The Ministry of Health is in charge
of the public hospitals, 

59
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,085
and it's job-to-be-done

60
00:03:27,285 --> 00:03:30,760
is to provide the population with
access to health care

61
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,960
including diagnostic capabilities.

62
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:36,248
However, it has very
limited budgets.

63
00:03:36,448 --> 00:03:39,060
Both for equipment,
and for training.

64
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:42,860
And virtually no budget for
maintenance of medical devices.

65
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,002
The hospitals run by the Ministry,

66
00:03:46,202 --> 00:03:49,202
must also often deal with
poor infrastructure,

67
00:03:49,402 --> 00:03:52,102
such as dysfunctional
electrical power grids.

68
00:03:52,593 --> 00:03:57,143
These are what we call the "pains"
of the customer segment.

69
00:03:57,684 --> 00:04:01,959
Another customer segment is local
or international NGOs.

70
00:04:02,634 --> 00:04:07,159
Some of them are supporting one,
or several hospitals from abroad.

71
00:04:07,651 --> 00:04:11,813
Some are locally based and manage
complete hospital chains

72
00:04:12,013 --> 00:04:15,013
with donor support from
industrialised countries.

73
00:04:15,566 --> 00:04:18,854
An NGO located in 
an industrial country

74
00:04:19,054 --> 00:04:22,729
may decide to purchase a batch
of x-ray systems

75
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,929
to be then commissioned in several
hospitals, 

76
00:04:26,129 --> 00:04:29,129
even if that NGO 
has no real presence

77
00:04:29,329 --> 00:04:30,566
in the country.

78
00:04:31,721 --> 00:04:34,946
This customer segment
has specific concerns.

79
00:04:35,726 --> 00:04:39,251
It wants  to maximise the impact of
donor money.

80
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,767
It also needs to show clear metrics
of this impact, 

81
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:44,867
on the health of beneficiaries.

82
00:04:45,538 --> 00:04:48,375
International NGOs
have more flexibility

83
00:04:48,575 --> 00:04:51,575
in resources allocation than
the Ministry of Health,

84
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:55,238
and their decision processes 
are usually much shorter.

85
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,320
Yet another type of customers

86
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,820
who might be interested in buying
such an x-ray machine

87
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,757
are national and international
development aid agencies.

88
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:08,695
Like the SDC in Switzerland, 

89
00:05:08,895 --> 00:05:10,870
USAID  in the US, 

90
00:05:11,070 --> 00:05:12,607
the GIZ in Germany,

91
00:05:12,807 --> 00:05:16,895
the JICA in Japan, or like
the African Development Bank.

92
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:20,774
The basic job-to-be-done
by these institutions

93
00:05:20,974 --> 00:05:24,174
is to foster the development
of less developed countries, 

94
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:26,574
and to strengthen international
cooperation.

95
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:30,482
They are concerned that the money 
they put into projects,

96
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:33,295
has a long lasting positive
impact, 

97
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:36,957
and that it empowers people
in the targeted countries.

98
00:05:38,092 --> 00:05:41,917
Note that we are using different 
colours for each customer segment.

99
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,865
This is important, because we know, 
that each segment

100
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,529
will potentially have to be dealt
with in a different way,

101
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:52,708
as we build up the complete canvas.

102
00:05:53,359 --> 00:05:55,447
For the sake of simplicity however, 

103
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:59,084
we will only present the business
model for the first customer segment

104
00:05:59,284 --> 00:06:01,172
in the rest of this example.

105
00:06:01,769 --> 00:06:05,344
Now that we have seen which customer
segment we want to target,

106
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,303
let us see which aspect
of the x-ray machine

107
00:06:08,503 --> 00:06:10,240
can be interesting to them.

108
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:13,843
We have seen that the hospitals
have limited budgets

109
00:06:14,043 --> 00:06:17,505
to buy new equipment and usually
no budget for its maintenance.

110
00:06:18,293 --> 00:06:23,218
We thus have to come up with
an attractive pricing proposition.

111
00:06:23,751 --> 00:06:27,013
In general, x-ray systems
are sold together

112
00:06:27,213 --> 00:06:30,413
with a maintenance contract which
can be very expensive,

113
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:34,201
and represents typically 10% of
the initial purchase price

114
00:06:34,401 --> 00:06:37,676
to be paid each and every year
to the manufacturer.

115
00:06:38,528 --> 00:06:41,703
Also, there is the cost
of the consumables 

116
00:06:41,903 --> 00:06:43,778
such as films and chemicals.

117
00:06:44,306 --> 00:06:47,881
If the customer wants to reduce
the total cost of ownership,

118
00:06:48,342 --> 00:06:51,805
it means to reduce the sum
of all these costs.

119
00:06:52,715 --> 00:06:54,802
Since our concept is digital,

120
00:06:55,002 --> 00:06:57,752
the costs of films and chemicals
are spared,

121
00:06:57,952 --> 00:07:00,652
which reduces the total cost 
of ownership.

122
00:07:01,203 --> 00:07:04,966
Also, since it has been redesigned
for the local context,

123
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:08,166
and it is very robust, 
maintenance and repair costs

124
00:07:08,366 --> 00:07:10,003
will also be reduced.

125
00:07:11,114 --> 00:07:14,301
Our value proposition is thus
a reduced

126
00:07:14,619 --> 00:07:16,894
total cost of ownership or TCO.

127
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:21,494
The second element is an inherent
robustness of the design

128
00:07:21,694 --> 00:07:24,531
including features such as
a power supply

129
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:27,869
which resists the local 
electrical instability

130
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:31,813
and a battery to allow 
continuous work

131
00:07:32,013 --> 00:07:34,725
in case of a black-out
for up to an hour.

132
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,806
This robustness reduces the frequent
downtimes

133
00:07:39,299 --> 00:07:42,587
experienced with other systems,
not designed for this context.

134
00:07:43,652 --> 00:07:46,989
Now as we claimed that our
technology is more robust,

135
00:07:47,189 --> 00:07:49,939
and also to address the lack
of maintenance budgets,

136
00:07:50,295 --> 00:07:53,320
we introduce an extended warranty.

137
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,520
In other words, an additional aspect
of the value proposition

138
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,182
is to include the maintenance fees
in the selling price of the device.

139
00:08:02,725 --> 00:08:06,575
The Ministry will pay only once
to acquire the machine

140
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:10,425
and then maintenance and repairs
will be provided free of charge

141
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:13,213
by the company for up to 6 years.

142
00:08:13,747 --> 00:08:17,097
The last crucial element
of the value proposition

143
00:08:17,567 --> 00:08:20,492
is the fact that 
the system is digital

144
00:08:20,692 --> 00:08:23,767
which enables the possibility
to transfer images

145
00:08:23,967 --> 00:08:27,930
through the internet when available
or via the cell phone network.

146
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:32,178
This feature offers the possibility
to transfer images

147
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:34,753
to a remotely located specialist

148
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:38,765
for a second opinion in case
of doubts on a diagnosis.

149
00:08:39,322 --> 00:08:41,035
This is called tele-medicine,

150
00:08:41,235 --> 00:08:43,410
or in this case, tele-radiology, 

151
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,972
and it is particularly interesting
for hospitals

152
00:08:46,172 --> 00:08:48,597
located in remote rural areas.

153
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:49,938
By definition, 

154
00:08:50,138 --> 00:08:53,551
local hospitals are located
directly in our target country

155
00:08:53,751 --> 00:08:56,576
or countries, possibly 
in remote areas.

156
00:08:56,867 --> 00:09:00,729
Unless the government buys 
a batch of machines centrally,

157
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:03,842
and takes care of dispatching them
in the country,

158
00:09:04,042 --> 00:09:05,342
which is usually no the case, 

159
00:09:05,542 --> 00:09:08,867
we must manage to deliver the x-ray
machine ourselves.

160
00:09:09,528 --> 00:09:12,016
As we have seen in 
the product value chain,

161
00:09:12,216 --> 00:09:15,491
the distribution channel can be
either a direct sale

162
00:09:15,691 --> 00:09:17,491
from the company to the customer, 

163
00:09:17,691 --> 00:09:20,378
or the product can be sold
though an intermediary.

164
00:09:20,805 --> 00:09:24,492
This intermediary, can be 
an independent partner

165
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:27,692
or a subsidiary of our own company.

166
00:09:28,249 --> 00:09:30,624
In our case, we decided
to create

167
00:09:30,977 --> 00:09:32,777
a local subsidiary,

168
00:09:32,977 --> 00:09:36,315
through which we will sell directly
to the Ministry of Health.

169
00:09:37,181 --> 00:09:40,206
This has the advantage of keeping
a tighter control

170
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:44,218
over the activities, especially with
regards to maintenance and repairs.

171
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:48,181
We decide to accept the challenge

172
00:09:48,381 --> 00:09:50,106
of running a local subsidiary

173
00:09:50,306 --> 00:09:53,206
because we already have a strong
local network.

174
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:56,125
And we have identified
a local expert

175
00:09:56,325 --> 00:10:00,275
who we want to put in charge of our
operations in Cameroon.

176
00:10:00,842 --> 00:10:04,142
He will be responsible for the sales
to the government,

177
00:10:04,342 --> 00:10:07,030
as well as for the commissioning
of the equipment,

178
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:10,342
the training of the users, and
the maintenance activities.

179
00:10:11,214 --> 00:10:14,551
As we have seen, maintenance 
activities are very important here.

180
00:10:14,751 --> 00:10:18,851
Since we have decided to provide
an extended warranty for the device

181
00:10:19,251 --> 00:10:20,814
in our value proposition.

182
00:10:21,677 --> 00:10:24,927
Our company must thus
remain very close

183
00:10:25,127 --> 00:10:26,615
to its customers.

184
00:10:27,215 --> 00:10:28,828
Such a local subsidiary

185
00:10:29,028 --> 00:10:33,115
represents also an obvious advantage
in terms of customer relationships.

186
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,448
A local subsidiary will
be able to establish

187
00:10:36,648 --> 00:10:39,335
closer relationships with
radiologists

188
00:10:39,535 --> 00:10:41,598
and government representatives
in the country.

189
00:10:41,999 --> 00:10:45,162
It's employees can travel more
easily inside the country, 

190
00:10:45,362 --> 00:10:48,362
even to remote areas 
to provide rapid

191
00:10:48,562 --> 00:10:50,324
local customer service.

192
00:10:51,044 --> 00:10:54,131
They are also likely to share 
a common culture

193
00:10:54,331 --> 00:10:56,306
and language with the customers.

194
00:10:56,795 --> 00:10:59,770
A local subsidiary is in
a good position

195
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:02,433
to relay country specific issues

196
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:06,433
that the main company will not
be aware of from a distant country.

197
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,825
All this helps to keep customers,
and acquire new ones.

198
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:14,559
But the next step in acquiring
the first customers

199
00:11:14,759 --> 00:11:17,321
is to involve them into 
the creation process

200
00:11:17,521 --> 00:11:18,434
as we have seen.

201
00:11:18,634 --> 00:11:22,271
This co-creation of the device
with local practitioners

202
00:11:22,471 --> 00:11:25,471
with relevant experience
has 2 effects:

203
00:11:25,755 --> 00:11:27,930
On the one hand it ensures

204
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:32,068
that the device is truly fit for
its purpose and context of use, 

205
00:11:32,592 --> 00:11:34,979
on the other hand, it ensures

206
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:38,492
the adhesion of the local
practitioners to the product,

207
00:11:38,692 --> 00:11:43,192
which counts a lot because they may 
be the future customers themselves,

208
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:46,342
or at least be in contact
with customers.

209
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,423
Typical business models in 
the medical technology sector

210
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:52,660
comprise 3 sources of revenues.

211
00:11:53,152 --> 00:11:55,865
One, the sale of the medical 
device itself,

212
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,895
which is a one-off sale.

213
00:11:58,317 --> 00:12:01,705
Two, the regular sale of consumables
such as reagents

214
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:04,905
or probes, which is called
recurring sales.

215
00:12:05,105 --> 00:12:09,267
And finally the sale of services
such as installing software upgrades,

216
00:12:09,467 --> 00:12:12,005
performing regular maintenance,
or calibration.

217
00:12:12,431 --> 00:12:16,168
Such a recurring sales model can
be very profitable for the company,

218
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,756
but it leads to a high total cost
of ownership for the customer.

219
00:12:19,956 --> 00:12:23,593
And it does not fit well with how
health care budgets are planned

220
00:12:23,793 --> 00:12:26,793
by governments in many
low-income countries.

221
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:31,362
Our revenue stream will thus
be made solely

222
00:12:31,562 --> 00:12:33,437
from the sale of the device

223
00:12:33,637 --> 00:12:35,887
which will include 6 years 
of warrranty

224
00:12:36,087 --> 00:12:37,500
as we had said before.

225
00:12:37,912 --> 00:12:40,575
As far as environmental benefits,

226
00:12:40,775 --> 00:12:42,187
there are 2 of them.

227
00:12:42,406 --> 00:12:45,556
First, as already mentioned, the
fact that we use digital

228
00:12:45,756 --> 00:12:47,893
rather than analog radiology,

229
00:12:48,093 --> 00:12:49,931
eliminates the need for chemicals

230
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:53,131
which would end-up being thrown
into the environment.

231
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:56,711
One performance indicator 
in this regard

232
00:12:57,024 --> 00:12:59,636
would be the amount 
of chemicals saved

233
00:12:59,836 --> 00:13:02,586
with each radiology done
by the machine.

234
00:13:02,786 --> 00:13:05,786
Another point is the innovative and
long-lasting power source

235
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,549
built in the machine,

236
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:10,699
which does not rely on
lead acid batteries.

237
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:14,511
Such batteries are very polluting
and must be replaced frequently.

238
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:18,056
Here, the number of lead acid
batteries avoided

239
00:13:18,256 --> 00:13:20,093
can be used as a metric.

240
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:24,391
Finally, the social benefits brought
by each machine

241
00:13:24,717 --> 00:13:28,392
is actually the very impact that
was originally targeted.

242
00:13:28,712 --> 00:13:30,700
As discussed earlier in this MOOC,

243
00:13:30,928 --> 00:13:34,915
it is difficult to disentangle 
the impact coming solely

244
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:38,803
from our initiative, from other
simultaneous initiatives.

245
00:13:40,115 --> 00:13:43,302
For example, improvement in
road safety laws,

246
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:47,596
could also contribute to a reduced
morbidity and mortality

247
00:13:47,969 --> 00:13:49,794
due to road traffic accidents.

248
00:13:50,382 --> 00:13:53,870
To solve this problem, and even if
we know this is not perfect,

249
00:13:54,070 --> 00:13:56,282
we can use proxy metrics

250
00:13:56,482 --> 00:13:58,382
for access to radiology instead.

251
00:13:58,582 --> 00:14:00,970
Such as the number 
of working machines,

252
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:03,932
or the number of radiographies
performed.

253
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:08,120
Now that we have seen the customer 
side of the business model,

254
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,220
let us turn to the company side.

255
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:13,388
This will help us understand
what it will take

256
00:14:13,588 --> 00:14:16,963
to provide the value to the customer
and the beneficiary.

257
00:14:17,901 --> 00:14:21,626
The system will be designed 
or engineered in our company.

258
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,965
Engineering will also include

259
00:14:24,165 --> 00:14:28,227
keeping the technology up to date,
with regards to obsolescent components

260
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:31,427
and technology evolution, 
as well as certified

261
00:14:31,627 --> 00:14:33,615
according to standards.

262
00:14:34,181 --> 00:14:36,944
It will then be marketed before
being shipped

263
00:14:37,144 --> 00:14:40,706
as separate modules to the local
subsidiary in Cameroon.

264
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:45,113
There, it will be assembled into
the complete x-ray system,

265
00:14:45,313 --> 00:14:47,963
tested, and delivered 
to the hospital.

266
00:14:48,631 --> 00:14:51,644
Our local subsidiary, will
also be responsible

267
00:14:51,844 --> 00:14:54,844
for commissioning the device
at the hospital.

268
00:14:55,044 --> 00:14:58,319
And for providing training to
the different types of users.

269
00:14:59,233 --> 00:15:01,883
We have seen that 
the proposed product

270
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:03,883
includes 6 years of maintenance.

271
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,546
So this will also be a key activity
of the company

272
00:15:07,746 --> 00:15:09,296
through its local subsidiary.

273
00:15:09,747 --> 00:15:13,510
These are actually a lot of
different activities

274
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,522
and in order to perform them all,

275
00:15:15,722 --> 00:15:17,985
several resources will be necessary.

276
00:15:18,185 --> 00:15:19,747
Let's look into that.

277
00:15:19,947 --> 00:15:23,010
The first key resources we will need
are of course humans.

278
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:27,310
We will mainly need engineers, 
technicians, and administrative personnel, 

279
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,084
as well as, a strong sales force

280
00:15:30,272 --> 00:15:32,072
especially in the local subsidiary.

281
00:15:32,479 --> 00:15:34,517
We will not need to 
build a real factory

282
00:15:34,717 --> 00:15:37,604
since we will not manufacture
the devices in-house

283
00:15:37,804 --> 00:15:38,904
as we will see.

284
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:42,467
However, we will need a facility for
the storage of product parts

285
00:15:42,667 --> 00:15:43,917
in Cameroon.

286
00:15:44,117 --> 00:15:47,179
The same facility will be used
for the final assembly, 

287
00:15:47,379 --> 00:15:51,304
as well as for repairs that will 
eventually have to be performed.

288
00:15:52,043 --> 00:15:54,818
Lastly, some key resources
of the company,

289
00:15:55,018 --> 00:15:57,918
will be its intellectual property
such as patents,

290
00:15:58,118 --> 00:16:01,118
and its in depth knowledge
of the country's context.

291
00:16:01,704 --> 00:16:04,954
These intangible key resources
have been acquired

292
00:16:05,154 --> 00:16:08,716
during the concept and feasibility 
phases of our project.

293
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,716
As well as, through the network
of stakeholders

294
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,779
that have been involved.

295
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:17,611
We have already reviewed all
the key stakeholders involved

296
00:16:17,811 --> 00:16:20,636
when we explained the product value
chain canvas

297
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:23,199
which is the best tool to
identify them.

298
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,549
We now see which ones we need
to closely partner with.

299
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:31,264
Since we have decided not to manufacture
the x-ray systems ourselves,

300
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:35,152
as it will be too costly to setup
a complete manufacturing plant, 

301
00:16:35,573 --> 00:16:38,798
we need to find what is called
a contract manufacturer.

302
00:16:39,503 --> 00:16:42,366
This partner will manufacture
the system's modules

303
00:16:42,566 --> 00:16:45,566
such as the power supply 
and the detector,

304
00:16:45,766 --> 00:16:48,766
in compliance with the required
regulatory constraints.

305
00:16:49,395 --> 00:16:52,395
Once all the sub-assemblies
are available, 

306
00:16:52,734 --> 00:16:55,322
they need to be transported
to Cameroon

307
00:16:55,522 --> 00:16:57,872
to be assembled into
a final product.

308
00:16:58,529 --> 00:17:02,066
This means we need to partner with
a freight forwarding company.

309
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,351
We also saw that training

310
00:17:05,551 --> 00:17:08,151
was extremely important for
this customer segment,

311
00:17:08,652 --> 00:17:11,264
and this is why we have to
partner

312
00:17:11,464 --> 00:17:14,577
with the professional association
of radiographers

313
00:17:14,854 --> 00:17:18,029
as well as with the faculty
of medicine

314
00:17:18,229 --> 00:17:20,442
of the University in Cameroon

315
00:17:21,191 --> 00:17:23,828
to develop adequate training
for radiography.

316
00:17:24,676 --> 00:17:27,551
Up until now, we have identified
all it takes

317
00:17:27,751 --> 00:17:29,738
to provide value
to our customer

318
00:17:29,938 --> 00:17:32,838
and fulfill our beneficiarie's
unmet needs.

319
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:34,851
Now comes the itchy part.

320
00:17:35,051 --> 00:17:38,988
The financial, environmental,
and social costs involved.

321
00:17:39,648 --> 00:17:42,010
In order to get our company
to be productive,

322
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:45,335
we must plan on paying
the salaries of our employees.

323
00:17:45,826 --> 00:17:49,076
We must also plan on the costs
of manufacturing,

324
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:50,663
and shipping the goods, 

325
00:17:50,863 --> 00:17:54,563
and we have to pay rent for
our warehouse in Cameroon.

326
00:17:55,170 --> 00:17:57,457
Environmental costs
in our case,

327
00:17:57,657 --> 00:18:00,407
would include the <i>CO2</i>
emissions generated

328
00:18:00,607 --> 00:18:02,957
due to shipping the parts overseas. 

329
00:18:03,709 --> 00:18:06,871
At this stage, we might
suddenly remember that

330
00:18:07,071 --> 00:18:09,959
there are some toxic components
in the system itself, 

331
00:18:10,159 --> 00:18:13,496
such as the oil used
in the high-voltage transformer.

332
00:18:14,205 --> 00:18:17,980
That is a typical example in which
we no have to go back

333
00:18:18,342 --> 00:18:22,092
and think about what would be needed
to recycle the transformer.

334
00:18:22,757 --> 00:18:27,569
This could for example lead us to plan
on some additional financial resources

335
00:18:27,769 --> 00:18:30,082
to take care of decommissioning.

336
00:18:31,139 --> 00:18:33,952
Finally, in terms of social costs,

337
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:37,781
making x-ray diagnostic available
to as many people as possible

338
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,310
should not come with 
a lot of downsides. 

339
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:44,810
We should however make sure
that people do not abuse

340
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:49,023
the machine, and maintain 
a reasonable level of exposure

341
00:18:49,223 --> 00:18:50,410
to x-rays.

342
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:53,923
Indeed, the digital imaging sensor
makes it very easy

343
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:56,148
and quick to retake an image

344
00:18:56,461 --> 00:18:59,436
if something was not absolutely
perfect the first time.

345
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:02,159
This could lead to over exposure.

346
00:19:02,676 --> 00:19:06,676
This problem should be mitigated
through adequate training.

347
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,860
The very last step is now
to see if our canvas

348
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,635
is balanced or not.

349
00:19:12,835 --> 00:19:16,285
Of course, this would require
that we go a bit further

350
00:19:16,485 --> 00:19:19,335
and start to plug numbers
into the triple bottom line.

351
00:19:19,642 --> 00:19:22,117
For example, we would
need to know precisely

352
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:24,405
how many x-ray system we could sell

353
00:19:24,605 --> 00:19:26,167
and at what price?

354
00:19:26,367 --> 00:19:29,992
Then we will have to calculate all
the costs on the left hand side

355
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:33,942
of the canvas such as salaries,
cost of manufacturing,

356
00:19:34,142 --> 00:19:35,580
shipping and so forth.

357
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:38,617
For the social and environmental
lines as well,

358
00:19:38,817 --> 00:19:43,005
we would need to find clear numbers
to better characterise the impact.

359
00:19:43,504 --> 00:19:47,629
With these figures, we would then
be able to verify

360
00:19:47,829 --> 00:19:50,829
if the costs are really outbalanced
by the benefits.

361
00:19:51,912 --> 00:19:54,400
In conclusion, I would like
to state that

362
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,025
this canvas should be seen
as a framework

363
00:19:57,345 --> 00:19:58,895
to tell a story.

364
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:03,299
As you have seen, we have constructed 
it in a particular sequence

365
00:20:03,801 --> 00:20:07,188
which kind of tells the story
of our business model.

366
00:20:07,616 --> 00:20:10,153
We can use this as
a mental guide

367
00:20:10,353 --> 00:20:12,828
when we have to pitch our model
to an investor.

368
00:20:13,504 --> 00:20:17,229
We hope that with this example,
you will now have a better idea

369
00:20:17,678 --> 00:20:20,278
of how to use this canvas with
your team.

370
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,169
It is a very powerful tool

371
00:20:22,369 --> 00:20:25,656
as it triggers important team
discussions about the strategy.

372
00:20:26,092 --> 00:20:28,617
Just like the other tools
presented in this MOOC, 

373
00:20:28,817 --> 00:20:32,367
it should be used regularly to
reassess the strategy

374
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:34,980
to make sure the model
is still valid

375
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:37,930
in spite of a rapidly
changing environment.

376
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:41,456
Our most important
advice though, is...

377
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:43,118
have fun using it!

378
00:20:43,526 --> 00:20:44,651
Goodbye. 

379
00:20:47,128 --> 00:20:50,478
