00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,115
Hello, in the previous video,
we saw how to set the objectives

2
00:00:20,309 --> 00:00:23,759
of our enterprise in terms
of the impact we want

3
00:00:23,955 --> 00:00:28,405
to achieve and the target
beneficiaries we want to help.

4
00:00:28,793 --> 00:00:33,080
Now, let us dig a little deeper
and see how our enterprise must

5
00:00:33,268 --> 00:00:37,555
be set up to reach these
beneficiaries and achieve impact.

6
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:41,743
In many business sectors
the person who buys a product will

7
00:00:41,914 --> 00:00:44,676
directly use it and benefit from it.

8
00:00:44,944 --> 00:00:49,168
However, in other sectors there
is a difference between the people

9
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:53,264
who will benefit from our technology
and the people who will actually

10
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:56,430
make the decision to buy it.

11
00:00:56,626 --> 00:01:00,750
As we think about how we can fill
the unmet need of the beneficiaries

12
00:01:00,935 --> 00:01:02,796
we are trying to help, we need to

13
00:01:02,982 --> 00:01:05,982
find out who will pay
for the technology.

14
00:01:06,413 --> 00:01:10,488
We need to find a customer or buyer.

15
00:01:10,675 --> 00:01:14,936
For example, a local hospital may
need to acquire a new medical

16
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:19,631
equipment and yet we may find out
that it is the ministry of health

17
00:01:19,821 --> 00:01:21,533
which will purchase it.

18
00:01:21,723 --> 00:01:25,823
In that case, the government is
our customer and our beneficiaries

19
00:01:26,018 --> 00:01:29,568
would be the patients who
get a better treatment.

20
00:01:29,931 --> 00:01:34,092
We must clearly understand how
and by whom the purchase decision

21
00:01:34,275 --> 00:01:35,575
is made.

22
00:01:35,764 --> 00:01:40,801
Another very important aspect is
what is called the job to be done.

23
00:01:40,986 --> 00:01:46,136
The exact motives why a buyer would
want to buy our technology, may be

24
00:01:46,322 --> 00:01:49,659
different from the pure wish to
fulfill the unmet needs of

25
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:51,298
a beneficiary.

26
00:01:51,495 --> 00:01:55,431
For example, let's assume
the hospital in our previous example

27
00:01:55,611 --> 00:01:59,773
is privately owned and that it wants
to acquire the medical equipment

28
00:01:59,955 --> 00:02:02,955
to propose it to wealthy patients.

29
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:07,211
The purchase decision will then
largely be influenced by

30
00:02:07,407 --> 00:02:10,957
the potential of this new
equipment to generate profit

31
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,515
for the hospitals owners.

32
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:17,814
In this example, the benefit for
the patient would not be the only

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,413
reason why the hospital makes
a decision to buy the equipment

34
00:02:21,587 --> 00:02:26,262
the hospital's job to be done would
then simply be to generate cash.

35
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:31,231
If we want to assure that our
technology will be made available

36
00:02:31,408 --> 00:02:36,921
we must clearly understand
the exact motivations of our buyer.

37
00:02:37,092 --> 00:02:40,092
What are his or hers pain points?

38
00:02:40,262 --> 00:02:43,387
Can we help solve them with
our proposed technology?

39
00:02:43,567 --> 00:02:49,367
Are there any potential gains that
we can help our customer achieve.

40
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:54,316
Of course when the beneficiary is
directly the buyer, we also need to

41
00:02:54,496 --> 00:02:57,721
clearly understand
his job to be done.

42
00:02:57,903 --> 00:03:02,553
And this may differ significantly
form what we had in mind.

43
00:03:02,739 --> 00:03:06,201
Once we start looking into
who can be our customer

44
00:03:06,384 --> 00:03:09,909
we generally quickly realize that
there may be different customer

45
00:03:10,098 --> 00:03:14,011
groups sometimes totally
unrelated to each others.

46
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:16,899
These groups are called
customer segments.

47
00:03:17,081 --> 00:03:21,018
Each segment maybe interested
in a different effect that our

48
00:03:21,207 --> 00:03:23,920
technology will have on
their own activities.

49
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,554
Each segment may just have
a different job to be done

50
00:03:27,729 --> 00:03:31,954
as we have seen with our public
and private hospital example.

51
00:03:32,491 --> 00:03:38,190
It is very important to identify all
our potential customer segments.

52
00:03:38,369 --> 00:03:43,243
Some may be beneficiaries directly
as we have seen, others may be

53
00:03:43,425 --> 00:03:46,825
organizations located
in our pilot country

54
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:51,067
still others may even be customers
located in rich countries using our

55
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:54,253
technology for a completely
different purpose.

56
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:58,755
identifying them all allows to
determine the best strategy

57
00:03:58,936 --> 00:04:01,236
to maximize our impact.

58
00:04:01,414 --> 00:04:05,152
Indeed playing with different
segments can offer some

59
00:04:05,363 --> 00:04:07,463
very interesting opportunities to

60
00:04:07,656 --> 00:04:10,831
increase our reach in
low income countries.

61
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,020
let me briefly explain
this mechanism.

62
00:04:14,205 --> 00:04:18,430
Let us assume that we decide to
sell a fraction of our products for

63
00:04:18,603 --> 00:04:21,815
a higher price and margin
in rich countries.

64
00:04:22,135 --> 00:04:26,872
This additional margin could then
be used to balance our deployment

65
00:04:27,054 --> 00:04:31,479
in poorer areas, where could then
accept to have a smaller profit

66
00:04:31,667 --> 00:04:33,942
margin and lower prices.

67
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:38,869
Along the same lines, increasing
our customer base will have as

68
00:04:39,087 --> 00:04:42,499
a consequence to increase
our production volumes.

69
00:04:42,701 --> 00:04:47,363
Larger volumes will offer a chance
to negotiate better pricing from our

70
00:04:47,547 --> 00:04:50,922
suppliers, which in turn will
make us more competitive

71
00:04:51,113 --> 00:04:55,188
and thus be able to offer
reduced prices for the poor.

72
00:04:55,792 --> 00:04:59,892
After we have identified all
the possible customer segments

73
00:05:00,094 --> 00:05:02,656
we will most certainly
have to make a choice

74
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:07,306
of which segment we want to serve
and which ones we choose to ignore.

75
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:11,305
This is a strategic decision that
the team has to make and which

76
00:05:11,489 --> 00:05:13,839
depends on many factors.

77
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:17,505
The danger here is that
we need to be careful

78
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,830
not to spread ourselves too thin
by wanting to pursue too many

79
00:05:22,004 --> 00:05:24,516
segments at the same time.

80
00:05:24,885 --> 00:05:28,647
Once we know our customer
segments as well as their specific

81
00:05:28,822 --> 00:05:31,059
needs we can determine how our

82
00:05:31,227 --> 00:05:33,777
product could be able
to fulfill these needs

83
00:05:33,951 --> 00:05:38,775
in other words, we can determine
what is the value that our products

84
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:40,451
can bring to our customer.

85
00:05:40,635 --> 00:05:45,310
This is what the "value propositions
block" is about in the canvas.

86
00:05:45,466 --> 00:05:48,704
Each customer segment would
typically require a different

87
00:05:48,886 --> 00:05:50,636
value proposition.

88
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:55,198
This does not imply that our
technology is different though.

89
00:05:55,365 --> 00:05:58,053
But the offering can be different.

90
00:05:58,239 --> 00:06:01,989
In other words, and I'm citing
Osterwalder and Pigneur:

91
00:06:02,172 --> 00:06:07,409
"Each value proposition consists of
selected bundle of products and

92
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:11,878
or services that cater to
the requirements of

93
00:06:12,048 --> 00:06:14,398
a specific customer segment."

94
00:06:14,878 --> 00:06:19,178
The value created for the customer
can be quantitative such as price

95
00:06:19,356 --> 00:06:25,431
or speed of service, or qualitative,
such as enhanced user experience.

96
00:06:25,913 --> 00:06:29,662
As an example, let's assume we
intend to develop a medical

97
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:33,301
device for patients in low
income countries.

98
00:06:33,655 --> 00:06:37,005
For a local hospital the job to
be done would be to be able

99
00:06:37,167 --> 00:06:41,105
to continue providing patient care
in spite of power cuts and with

100
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,450
a lack of trained personnel.

101
00:06:43,618 --> 00:06:47,580
In this case, the value proposition
could be the combination of

102
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:52,110
a robust device able to work on
battery and a training workshop

103
00:06:52,284 --> 00:06:55,634
offered to key hospital personnel.

104
00:06:55,969 --> 00:07:00,519
The same technology could also be
proposed in industrialized countries

105
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:03,822
To work for example as
an electrically autonomous

106
00:07:03,999 --> 00:07:06,549
medical system in ambulances.

107
00:07:06,746 --> 00:07:11,384
In this second case the ambulance
personnel needs a rugged device

108
00:07:11,570 --> 00:07:12,682
that can be taken out of

109
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:15,754
the ambulance to be
applied to the patient

110
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,310
on the accident's site.

111
00:07:17,486 --> 00:07:21,086
In this case, the value proposition
could be the same technology

112
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:24,981
without the training, but with
and adapter that allows the device

113
00:07:25,156 --> 00:07:29,006
to be easily and solidly
attached to the ambulance.

114
00:07:29,692 --> 00:07:33,917
Now, having a match between what we
are offering and what our customer

115
00:07:34,097 --> 00:07:36,497
wants is not quite sufficient.

116
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,569
We will still need our customer to

117
00:07:38,751 --> 00:07:41,926
be aware of the existence
of our product offering

118
00:07:42,116 --> 00:07:45,116
and also to be able to
purchase it and receive it.

119
00:07:45,316 --> 00:07:48,978
This is broadly speaking the role
of distribution channels.

120
00:07:49,164 --> 00:07:54,614
As you may recall from our product
value chain video, this is not only

121
00:07:54,828 --> 00:07:58,640
about deciding how to transport
the product, but also and even more

122
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:03,551
importantly about defining if
there will be intermediaries in

123
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:05,762
the distribution process.

124
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:10,154
Will we directly sell the product
to the customer, or will we sell it

125
00:08:10,338 --> 00:08:14,838
to a re-seller who will then provide
the product to the customer

126
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,568
there are, for example, wholesalers
who will buy a large quantity of

127
00:08:18,757 --> 00:08:22,494
goods and then sell them to
retailers, who finally sell

128
00:08:22,724 --> 00:08:25,124
to individual customers.

129
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,178
Some international companies have
been successful in deploying their

130
00:08:29,393 --> 00:08:34,067
products in low-income countries
because they decided to sell through

131
00:08:34,244 --> 00:08:36,293
small village groceries.

132
00:08:36,489 --> 00:08:38,913
This is a very important question

133
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,631
as independent intermediaries
may give us access to a wide local

134
00:08:43,808 --> 00:08:47,945
customer base, which is
great as we strive to scale up.

135
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,283
But they will also keep
a margin on the product sale.

136
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:57,504
Alternatively, would we rather want
to have our own local subsidiaries

137
00:08:57,692 --> 00:09:02,091
close to the customer which will
increase our operation's costs

138
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,803
and complexity, but offer
the advantage of a more

139
00:09:06,008 --> 00:09:08,882
direct contact with our customers?

140
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:12,432
Getting the product to our customer
can be a challenge and needs to be

141
00:09:12,654 --> 00:09:14,416
carefully thought out.

142
00:09:14,594 --> 00:09:17,331
There are multiple innovative
techniques which are being

143
00:09:17,539 --> 00:09:21,863
used by companies such as direct
sales through the internet or

144
00:09:22,086 --> 00:09:23,360
mobile phones.

145
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,550
This of course works
well for software.

146
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:31,214
When tangible goods are sold,
it will of course always involve

147
00:09:31,405 --> 00:09:33,954
transporting them to the customer.

148
00:09:34,145 --> 00:09:37,670
As we have seen in the product
value chain video, setting up such

149
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,299
a channel can be a challenge

150
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:42,883
typically for delivery
to remote areas.

151
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:46,633
However, it can also be
a matter of innovation, per say

152
00:09:46,811 --> 00:09:49,472
and become a part of
our value proposition

153
00:09:49,659 --> 00:09:53,984
if we manage to develop our
own efficient distribution channel.

154
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:59,586
Once the product has been delivered,
we also have to think about how

155
00:09:59,764 --> 00:10:04,551
the after-sale relationships,
such as repairs, customer questions

156
00:10:04,755 --> 00:10:07,180
and complaints will be handled.

157
00:10:07,376 --> 00:10:12,475
This brings us to the next block. 
The canvas allows to raise another

158
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:16,032
important question, which is
the relationship that the company

159
00:10:16,229 --> 00:10:19,016
needs to have with it's customers.

160
00:10:19,195 --> 00:10:24,619
Here we have to reflect how we want
to acquire customers, what strategy

161
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:29,829
we have to retain them and also
how we can work together with

162
00:10:30,023 --> 00:10:35,161
customers to improve our technology
and increase our reach.

163
00:10:35,903 --> 00:10:39,478
These customer relationships
are extremely important

164
00:10:39,662 --> 00:10:43,611
since they allow to measure and
improve customer satisfaction

165
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:48,668
which can mean great success
or rapid failure of our company.

166
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:52,972
As you can see in the canvas,
the box is actually bi-directional

167
00:10:53,176 --> 00:10:56,838
which really underscores
the importance of the mutual

168
00:10:57,013 --> 00:11:00,013
interaction between the company
and it's customers.

169
00:11:00,392 --> 00:11:04,354
We need to find out how to learn
from the customer as well as even

170
00:11:04,535 --> 00:11:07,459
co-develop solutions.

171
00:11:07,645 --> 00:11:11,594
Customer relationships need to be
taken very seriously and nurtured.

172
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:15,746
I'm insisting on this aspect,
because it is a frequent cause

173
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,940
of failure in business in general.

174
00:11:19,814 --> 00:11:23,513
Finally, we need to make sure that
our company will be sustainable

175
00:11:23,696 --> 00:11:27,283
on a financial, environmental
and social level.

176
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:33,079
The revenue streams box basically
asks what our customer will pay for

177
00:11:33,246 --> 00:11:35,620
how much they will pay and when.

178
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:38,501
Will they have to pay
a recurring annual fee?

179
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:42,950
Will they pay for your product
itself or for the right to use it?

180
00:11:43,127 --> 00:11:47,051
For example, if our company
wants to provide a water purifier

181
00:11:47,234 --> 00:11:53,097
to small water kiosks in rural
villages, will we sell the machines?

182
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:57,274
We could also propose to
lend or lease them. In that case

183
00:11:57,447 --> 00:12:01,372
the local owner of the water kiosk
will sell the water and pay for

184
00:12:01,555 --> 00:12:06,843
the rent of the machine with
a part of his revenues from sales.

185
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:11,439
In that example, our company would
also provide maintenance and repair

186
00:12:11,637 --> 00:12:14,136
as a part of the value proposition.

187
00:12:14,318 --> 00:12:17,656
Generally there are two different
types of revenue streams.

188
00:12:17,832 --> 00:12:23,456
Transaction revenues from a one-time
sale, or recurring revenues from 

189
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:27,217
ongoing payments, such
as the water kiosk example.

190
00:12:28,443 --> 00:12:32,792
The environmental, and social
benefit must also be assessed

191
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,246
with the same rigor.

192
00:12:34,569 --> 00:12:38,231
We need to clearly identify how
our technology will benefit to

193
00:12:38,403 --> 00:12:42,116
the environment and to the social
issue we want to solve.

194
00:12:42,421 --> 00:12:45,633
For this, we can go back to
the analysis performed with

195
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:47,710
our impact canvas tool.

196
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:51,131
Measuring financial revenue
streams is quite straight forward.

197
00:12:51,324 --> 00:12:56,486
However, we also need to define
one or two metrics which we call

198
00:12:56,656 --> 00:13:00,717
key performance indicators,
or KPIs for our environmental

199
00:13:00,893 --> 00:13:02,579
and social returns.

200
00:13:02,744 --> 00:13:06,619
For example, it is not sufficient to
claim that our technology will

201
00:13:06,802 --> 00:13:12,038
reduce CO2 emissions or that it
will improve cardiovascular health.  

202
00:13:12,206 --> 00:13:16,393
We need to have metrics to
quantify this claim, like

203
00:13:16,566 --> 00:13:21,728
the number of tons of CO2 that won't
be emitted, or the percentage 

204
00:13:21,905 --> 00:13:25,617
improvement in mortality
caused by cardiovascular problems.

205
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:27,872
As we have said in the past videos

206
00:13:28,045 --> 00:13:31,557
it might be very hard to
clearly measure impact.

207
00:13:31,729 --> 00:13:34,190
We can just decide
to measure outcomes

208
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:37,823
as a proxy for impact
if that is easier.

209
00:13:38,098 --> 00:13:41,384
But we need to be cognizant
that this is a simplification

210
00:13:41,555 --> 00:13:44,555
and could lead us to
misinterpretations.

211
00:13:45,106 --> 00:13:47,730
As a summary this part of
the sustainable business

212
00:13:47,906 --> 00:13:50,906
model canvas is focused
on the customer.

213
00:13:51,132 --> 00:13:54,256
We need to remember,
that if we want our customer

214
00:13:54,444 --> 00:13:57,643
To be interested in buying
our products, there must

215
00:13:57,836 --> 00:14:01,685
be a good fit between our customer's
"job to be done", and our

216
00:14:01,866 --> 00:14:03,141
value proposition.

217
00:14:03,331 --> 00:14:06,280
The key to achieving such
a good match is to understand

218
00:14:06,471 --> 00:14:08,695
exactly who our customers are, 

219
00:14:08,885 --> 00:14:12,096
their pains as well
as their potential gains.

220
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:16,725
Once we understand this we can
determine what it is, in and around

221
00:14:16,913 --> 00:14:20,425
our product, which is of
most interest to them.

222
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:24,734
We need to remember also that
different customer segments

223
00:14:24,925 --> 00:14:26,887
will have different
"jobs to be done"

224
00:14:27,068 --> 00:14:31,105
and will thus be interested in
different aspects of our product.

225
00:14:31,416 --> 00:14:35,803
This will lead us to specific value
propositions for each of our

226
00:14:35,994 --> 00:14:37,793
customer segments.

227
00:14:37,995 --> 00:14:41,544
Finally of course, earning
money is important.

228
00:14:41,736 --> 00:14:45,497
If only to assure that our
enterprise will be durably

229
00:14:45,673 --> 00:14:48,498
active and capable to grow.

230
00:14:48,696 --> 00:14:52,846
However, we also
regularly need to assure

231
00:14:53,036 --> 00:14:56,460
that we are really and effectively
reaching the social and

232
00:14:56,629 --> 00:15:01,541
environmental goals that we have
set to ourselves in the beginning.

233
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,057
We need to check if our
beneficiaries really benefit

234
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:07,417
from our initiative.

235
00:15:07,706 --> 00:15:11,480
We need to keep in mind that
we have a triple bottom line

236
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:15,852
where the focus must
be on all three criteria.

237
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:20,143
In the next video we will see that
this triple bottom line obviously

238
00:15:20,318 --> 00:15:24,954
also has a counterpart as
costs in financial, environmental

239
00:15:25,156 --> 00:15:26,692
and social terms.

240
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,284
Goodbye.
