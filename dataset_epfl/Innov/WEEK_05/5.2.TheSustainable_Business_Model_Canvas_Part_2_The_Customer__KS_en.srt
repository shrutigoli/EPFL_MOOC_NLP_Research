1
00:00:21,066 --> 00:00:22,253
In the previous lecture,

2
00:00:22,453 --> 00:00:25,041
we developed and discussed 
the key building block

3
00:00:25,418 --> 00:00:27,030
of your business model,

4
00:00:27,511 --> 00:00:30,823
namely, the customer, who is the king
of your business model.

5
00:00:31,388 --> 00:00:34,275
We also discussed about the promise
you pledge to the customer

6
00:00:34,475 --> 00:00:37,938
to solve a problem, or satisfy
a need they have,

7
00:00:38,449 --> 00:00:41,912
which is conveyed via your
value proposition.

8
00:00:43,454 --> 00:00:45,916
In this lecture, we will 
examine things

9
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:49,116
from the enterprise or company
perspective.

10
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:51,701
In other words, 

11
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:54,942
we will examine all the key
building blocks

12
00:00:55,411 --> 00:00:59,399
that go into the process that
allows the enterprise

13
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:03,136
to generate a value promised
to the customer.

14
00:01:04,252 --> 00:01:08,564
These can be classified broadly
speaking into 3 categories.

15
00:01:10,352 --> 00:01:11,827
Key Activities,

16
00:01:13,374 --> 00:01:14,836
Key Resources, 

17
00:01:15,896 --> 00:01:17,996
and Key Partnerships.

18
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:21,285
Now if we look at the overall canvas

19
00:01:21,485 --> 00:01:23,923
we will see that we are 
discussing primarily

20
00:01:24,123 --> 00:01:26,010
the left middle part,

21
00:01:26,567 --> 00:01:28,505
labelled Operations.

22
00:01:28,705 --> 00:01:31,705
Which basically pertains to your
company or enterprise

23
00:01:31,905 --> 00:01:33,742
and it's operations.

24
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,316
One of the first aspects
you have to confront

25
00:01:37,516 --> 00:01:39,953
is what are the most 
essential tasks, or key activities

26
00:01:40,153 --> 00:01:43,966
that the company
has to carry out themselves

27
00:01:44,166 --> 00:01:46,891
towards generating the proposed value.

28
00:01:47,544 --> 00:01:50,219
Depending on the type of product
you are involved with.

29
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:54,131
Key activities for example could 
entail product development

30
00:01:54,331 --> 00:01:58,531
and production, if you are dealing 
with a physical technology product.

31
00:01:59,111 --> 00:02:03,424
Or software development if your 
product is software based.

32
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:07,812
The other issue you 
then have to confront

33
00:02:08,012 --> 00:02:12,250
is what are the key resources 
or the most critical assets

34
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,950
required for you to succeed 
with your key activities

35
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:18,350
and proposed value generation.

36
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:20,983
For example, for a technology 
based product

37
00:02:21,183 --> 00:02:23,321
you will likely require

38
00:02:23,888 --> 00:02:25,550
human expertise,

39
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:30,706
as technology based products 
are generally knowledge intensive.

40
00:02:31,908 --> 00:02:33,658
Intellectual property, 

41
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:35,646
patents, copyrights, etc.

42
00:02:35,846 --> 00:02:38,483
And perhaps a manufacturing facility.

43
00:02:39,223 --> 00:02:43,236
Of course, in order to realize
your operations you will always need

44
00:02:43,945 --> 00:02:47,482
various strategic or 
key partnerships.

45
00:02:48,832 --> 00:02:50,994
Key partners could be 
your suppliers,

46
00:02:51,535 --> 00:02:53,023
sub contractors,

47
00:02:53,367 --> 00:02:55,529
e.g for contract manufacturing.

48
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:58,081
But remember you don't have
to do everything.

49
00:02:58,281 --> 00:03:00,594
Certain things may best
be sub contracted

50
00:03:00,794 --> 00:03:03,581
and you may wish to keep only
what is core

51
00:03:03,781 --> 00:03:07,081
and most critical or sensitive
within the company.

52
00:03:07,634 --> 00:03:11,021
Such an approach may allow you 
to scale up cost effectively

53
00:03:11,221 --> 00:03:12,509
and efficiently.

54
00:03:12,709 --> 00:03:16,384
So, be sure to assess that very carefully
when defining your key activity

55
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:20,959
to determine which activity really
has to be done within the company.

56
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:23,521
And which ones can be outsourced

57
00:03:24,164 --> 00:03:25,751
to key partners,

58
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:30,068
who may already be highly experienced 
and running cost effectively

59
00:03:30,268 --> 00:03:33,268
than you ever would for
the given activity.

60
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:35,868
Now the bottom left part 
of the canvas

61
00:03:36,068 --> 00:03:38,393
is concerned with cost structure.

62
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:43,395
<i>This essentially refers to all the cost 
incurred in all of the operations</i>

63
00:03:44,045 --> 00:03:46,595
<i>to generate your proposed
value and delivering it</i>

64
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:48,307
<i>to the customer.</i>

65
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,402
<i>There are various types
of cost structures,</i>

66
00:03:50,602 --> 00:03:54,439
<i>but for simplicity, we'll limit our 
discussion to 2 basic categories.</i>

67
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:58,689
<i>That is, cost-driven, and 
value-driven cost structures.</i>

68
00:03:59,556 --> 00:04:02,881
<i>Cost-driven cost structures entail
minimizing costs</i>

69
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:05,347
<i>as much as possible, enabling</i>

70
00:04:05,547 --> 00:04:09,234
<i>to pass on those savings as
a value proposition</i>

71
00:04:09,434 --> 00:04:10,734
<i>to the customer.</i>

72
00:04:11,317 --> 00:04:15,442
<i>Ostewalder and Pigneur, in their book, give 
examples of No Frills Airlines</i>

73
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:18,330
<i>such as Easy Jet, 
and Ryan Air</i>

74
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,580
<i>in Europe, for example.</i>

75
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,900
<i>Whereas value-driven cost 
structure on the other hand</i>

76
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,925
<i>position themselves as 
premium luxury</i>

77
00:04:28,413 --> 00:04:29,351
<i>brands, </i>

78
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:33,276
<i>that can sometimes be laden with 
all sorts of bells and whistles.</i>

79
00:04:34,302 --> 00:04:37,065
<i>And here, think of a Rolls Royce 
car, for example.</i>

80
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:39,288
<i>But it turns out that 
in reality, </i>

81
00:04:39,488 --> 00:04:42,163
<i>most cost structures fall 
somewhere in the middle</i>

82
00:04:42,614 --> 00:04:44,476
<i>of these 2 extremes.</i>

83
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:48,051
<i>Now in the 
traditional canvas, </i>

84
00:04:48,546 --> 00:04:51,409
<i>the cost structure is limited
only to financial costs.</i>

85
00:04:52,602 --> 00:04:54,740
However, in reality, 
operations may also

86
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:58,090
likely engender a cost
to the environment.

87
00:04:58,615 --> 00:05:00,553
Either by way of excessive emissions,

88
00:05:00,753 --> 00:05:03,240
which may not necessarily
be intended, of course.

89
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,990
It could also happen that your
operations may have

90
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,620
unintended social 
consequences as well,

91
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:14,395
or social costs in the communities
where they operate.

92
00:05:15,308 --> 00:05:19,358
Therefore, given that you aim to 
achieve not just only financial viability,

93
00:05:19,558 --> 00:05:22,133
but also environmental 
sustainability

94
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:23,995
and social impact,

95
00:05:24,195 --> 00:05:27,133
it is very important that you are 
able to establish metrics

96
00:05:27,333 --> 00:05:30,333
that can enable you to monitor
and even quantify

97
00:05:30,533 --> 00:05:32,520
environmental and social costs.

98
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:35,608
Hence, the original canvas

99
00:05:35,808 --> 00:05:39,308
has been updated to also reflect
costs coming from

100
00:05:39,508 --> 00:05:41,921
environmental and social factors.

101
00:05:42,636 --> 00:05:44,973
Now the currency you use
for financial aspects

102
00:05:45,173 --> 00:05:47,811
is revenue streams, 
as measured in your

103
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:52,398
particular currency such as dollars,
or euros, or what have you.

104
00:05:52,787 --> 00:05:56,487
<i>While the currency for 
environmental and social factor</i>

105
00:05:56,687 --> 00:05:59,425
<i>is Key Performance 
Indicator scores,</i>

106
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,300
<i>or KPI scores.</i>

107
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:06,525
<i>Key performance indicators can be 
basically grouped into 4 categories, </i>

108
00:06:06,725 --> 00:06:07,975
<i>namely, </i>

109
00:06:08,654 --> 00:06:11,229
<i>Emissions to air, </i>

110
00:06:11,826 --> 00:06:13,776
<i>e.g green house gasses.</i>

111
00:06:14,585 --> 00:06:17,997
<i>Emissions to water. 
e.g heavy metal emissions.</i>

112
00:06:19,073 --> 00:06:22,485
<i>Emissions to land.
e.g pesticides.</i>

113
00:06:22,938 --> 00:06:24,551
<i>Radioactive waste,</i>

114
00:06:24,751 --> 00:06:29,351
<i>and intensive usage of naturally
occurring resources.</i>

115
00:06:29,551 --> 00:06:33,851
<i>e.g water, oil, forestry, etc.</i>

116
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,214
<i>Just as much as you wish to
minimise your total financial costs</i>

117
00:06:38,691 --> 00:06:41,404
<i>and maximise your total
revenue streams,</i>

118
00:06:41,695 --> 00:06:44,932
<i>when assessing your cost benefit 
ratio for each product,</i>

119
00:06:45,575 --> 00:06:49,550
<i>you should also strive to make sure 
that your environmental and social costs</i>

120
00:06:50,084 --> 00:06:53,947
<i>do not out-weigh your environmental
and social KPI scores</i>

121
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:55,872
<i>respectively.</i>

122
00:06:56,216 --> 00:07:00,003
<i>The extent to which you wish
to tip the cost benefit scale</i>

123
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,053
<i>one way or the other</i>

124
00:07:02,253 --> 00:07:05,716
<i>will be largely influenced by
the mission and strategy</i>

125
00:07:05,916 --> 00:07:08,678
<i>you set yourself 
at the beginning,</i>

126
00:07:08,945 --> 00:07:12,020
<i>which is reflected at the top
left hand corner</i>

127
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,283
<i>of this adapted canvas.</i>

128
00:07:14,795 --> 00:07:18,607
We have now gone through the whole
sustainable business model canvas.

129
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:23,342
In this last part, we have seen how
the company can create the value proposition

130
00:07:23,542 --> 00:07:25,480
that it will deliver
to it's customers.

131
00:07:26,254 --> 00:07:28,542
We have discussed, in particular,

132
00:07:28,892 --> 00:07:31,917
the idea of what key resources
and key activities

133
00:07:32,526 --> 00:07:34,514
should be part of your core business

134
00:07:34,714 --> 00:07:36,739
and a key to creating this value.

135
00:07:36,939 --> 00:07:40,339
And which ones can be sub-contracted
or outsourced

136
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:42,251
to external partners.

137
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:46,110
Finally, we have seen that
similarly to benefits,

138
00:07:46,524 --> 00:07:49,824
which must be measured not
only at the financial level,

139
00:07:50,314 --> 00:07:53,639
but also at the environmental
and social levels,

140
00:07:54,534 --> 00:07:57,622
that is the costs linked to
your company's activities

141
00:07:57,822 --> 00:08:00,997
must be evaluated on all these 3 levels.

142
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:05,090
The bottom line of this
sustainable business canvas,

143
00:08:05,438 --> 00:08:08,450
as opposed to more traditional
business model,

144
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,988
is that in order to be 
truly sustainable

145
00:08:11,622 --> 00:08:13,897
your business must be balanced
not only

146
00:08:14,439 --> 00:08:15,864
at the financial level,

147
00:08:16,064 --> 00:08:19,814
but also regarding it's 
environmental and social aspects.

148
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:24,180
In order to achieve this, you will 
have to make some trade offs.

149
00:08:25,249 --> 00:08:28,837
And deciding which ones are acceptable
for you will be determined

150
00:08:29,037 --> 00:08:31,849
by your own values and mission.

151
00:08:33,392 --> 00:08:37,155
The next lecture will illustrate
this tool by way of an example

152
00:08:37,330 --> 00:08:40,142
using our X-ray imaging
system example.

153
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:41,791
Goodbye.
