1
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:23,318
So far we have seen the process
for the development

2
00:00:23,468 --> 00:00:26,049
of a meaningful innovative 
technology in the context

3
00:00:26,249 --> 00:00:27,501
of sustainable development.

4
00:00:28,201 --> 00:00:31,169
We also showed you tools  to ensure
that the technology you develop

5
00:00:31,438 --> 00:00:34,676
will fulfill its function 
in reaching the intended impact.

6
00:00:35,574 --> 00:00:39,012
However, your well-crafted technology
will never have any impact

7
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,484
if it remains in your garage

8
00:00:41,684 --> 00:00:44,597
or if only a single prototype
is ever fabricated.

9
00:00:45,088 --> 00:00:47,944
Again, in this course,
we subscribe to the notion

10
00:00:48,169 --> 00:00:50,982
that the wider the essential
technologies are deployed

11
00:00:51,194 --> 00:00:53,326
and the more people
have access to them

12
00:00:53,513 --> 00:00:55,323
the greater the impact.

13
00:00:56,052 --> 00:00:58,653
So now that you have seen
how to develop

14
00:00:58,853 --> 00:01:00,693
an innovative technology,
the question is 

15
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:05,238
how you plan to deploy it
at scale, that is, as widely as possible

16
00:01:05,463 --> 00:01:07,156
over the long run.

17
00:01:07,393 --> 00:01:09,620
The impact value chain canvas
that we presented

18
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:13,008
earlier in this course helps you
to set your social target goal

19
00:01:13,495 --> 00:01:15,834
and define the necessary steps
to get to it.

20
00:01:16,459 --> 00:01:19,247
It also helps you to identify
the stakeholders

21
00:01:19,722 --> 00:01:21,803
that you have to involve
in the process.

22
00:01:22,629 --> 00:01:24,309
The product value chain 
that was presented

23
00:01:24,497 --> 00:01:27,129
 in the previous videos
allows you to map out

24
00:01:27,317 --> 00:01:30,285
the different phases
in the life-cycle of your product

25
00:01:30,485 --> 00:01:33,485
along with the corresponding actors
or partners,

26
00:01:33,685 --> 00:01:37,129
while taking into account
their constraints

27
00:01:37,323 --> 00:01:38,628
when designing your product.

28
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:41,885
This helps you to establish
the technical specifications

29
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:44,687
 of your product and enable you
to think through the issues

30
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:47,768
related to its production, 
usage, etc.

31
00:01:48,005 --> 00:01:50,204
But none of these tools
will help you think through

32
00:01:50,392 --> 00:01:53,959
how you will deliver your product
to your customers or beneficiaries

33
00:01:54,134 --> 00:01:56,976
and how to get paid,
by who and why.

34
00:01:57,831 --> 00:02:01,138
Remember, unless your entreprise
can generate excess revenue

35
00:02:01,339 --> 00:02:04,514
or profit from its operations,
it is unlikely for it to remain

36
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:05,915
viable and sustainable.

37
00:02:06,115 --> 00:02:09,115
So you need to understand
how to define, as clearly as you can,

38
00:02:09,315 --> 00:02:11,226
how you will derive revenue.

39
00:02:11,426 --> 00:02:14,544
This is generally referred to
as your business model.

40
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:17,787
However, there is a lot more around
your business model

41
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:21,162
than simply collecting revenues,
which is the endpoint.

42
00:02:21,362 --> 00:02:24,362
Firstly, you make a certain promise
to the customer 

43
00:02:24,562 --> 00:02:26,597
by way of your Value Proposition

44
00:02:26,759 --> 00:02:28,706
then you have to make sure
that your operations

45
00:02:28,918 --> 00:02:31,775
for realizing the product are
economically viable

46
00:02:31,975 --> 00:02:35,819
to enable you to honor your promise
or Value Proposition to the client.

47
00:02:36,019 --> 00:02:38,442
Thereafter, you have to ensure
that the product is delivered

48
00:02:38,617 --> 00:02:40,796
in a manner consistent
with the promise

49
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,638
or Value Proposition,
which may require setting up

50
00:02:43,838 --> 00:02:46,838
a set of relationships
that will ensure this objective,

51
00:02:47,038 --> 00:02:49,540
for example,
sales and distribution channels.

52
00:02:49,702 --> 00:02:52,232
This then finally triggers
the revenue or payment event,

53
00:02:52,432 --> 00:02:54,610
and hopefully 
the commitment to a series

54
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,595
of ensuing revenue events

55
00:02:57,795 --> 00:02:59,685
at a predetermined frequency.

56
00:02:59,871 --> 00:03:02,060
But very importantly,
you must ensure

57
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,106
that the overall operations 
is sustainable on all three pillars.

58
00:03:05,306 --> 00:03:08,548
That is economically,
socially and environmentally,

59
00:03:08,735 --> 00:03:11,900
which is termed the Triple Bottom Line. 

60
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,706
Now the sustainable
business model canvas tools

61
00:03:13,918 --> 00:03:16,843
that we'll be discussing
in the next two to three videos

62
00:03:17,056 --> 00:03:20,631
represents all these issues
around your business model

63
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:21,970
in a single page.

64
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:24,581
The Sustainable
Business Model Canvas we present

65
00:03:24,781 --> 00:03:27,781
is a slight variation
of the original business model canvas

66
00:03:27,981 --> 00:03:30,752
<i>developed 
by Alexander Osterwalder</i>

67
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:33,952
<i>and Yves Pigneur
in Lausanne, Switzerland.</i>

68
00:03:34,794 --> 00:03:36,983
The canvas tools is made out
of several boxes

69
00:03:37,171 --> 00:03:39,591
that are all interconnected
in some way.

70
00:03:39,839 --> 00:03:43,057
The main difference between
this version and the original one

71
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:46,751
is that we also treat 
the aspects of social impact

72
00:03:46,951 --> 00:03:48,190
and sustainability.

73
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:51,801
Whereas, the original version
confines itself primarily

74
00:03:52,001 --> 00:03:53,348
to economic issues.

75
00:03:53,535 --> 00:03:56,181
It may look complex but in fact

76
00:03:56,823 --> 00:04:00,700
it's a great tool to help you answer
the key questions we evoked before.

77
00:04:01,882 --> 00:04:04,688
This tool is really intended 
to be used as a team

78
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:06,767
involving your colleagues
and ideally

79
00:04:06,954 --> 00:04:08,491
some of your key stakeholders
 as well

80
00:04:08,741 --> 00:04:10,432
around good food and drinks.

81
00:04:10,810 --> 00:04:14,348
But be prepared for lively
and passionate discussions though.

82
00:04:15,367 --> 00:04:19,223
The exercise itself involves using
post-it sticky notes to represent

83
00:04:19,423 --> 00:04:22,146
the answers to the questions posed
during the exercise.

84
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:23,515
during the exercise.

85
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:30,093
The canvas itself can be split
into three broad categories.

86
00:04:31,677 --> 00:04:34,909
The first part represents
the overall mission

87
00:04:35,552 --> 00:04:36,722
of your enterprise.

88
00:04:37,975 --> 00:04:40,261
While the second category is
about the activities

89
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,211
or operations of your enterprise.

90
00:04:43,862 --> 00:04:46,652
And the third category is about
performance metrics of your activities.

91
00:04:47,062 --> 00:04:50,848
The purpose of each individual box
is to enable to ask questions,

92
00:04:51,048 --> 00:04:52,563
organize the answers

93
00:04:52,788 --> 00:04:55,894
and see how they influence
each other as we will see.

94
00:04:56,401 --> 00:04:58,230
The overall mission
of your enterprise

95
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,069
should be well defined by now, using
the Impact Framework tools

96
00:05:02,653 --> 00:05:04,680
that we previously introduced

97
00:05:05,094 --> 00:05:06,411
earlier in the course.

98
00:05:06,824 --> 00:05:09,689
So by defining what social impact
you wish to achieve,

99
00:05:10,024 --> 00:05:13,237
or which sustainable development goal
you wish to target

100
00:05:13,437 --> 00:05:14,603
with your technology.

101
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:17,651
This will help you also define
who will benefit 

102
00:05:18,043 --> 00:05:19,237
from your technology

103
00:05:20,096 --> 00:05:21,923
But knowing 
who your beneficiaries are 

104
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:23,741
is only a starting point.

105
00:05:24,873 --> 00:05:27,600
One of the first questions
to ask yourself is:

106
00:05:28,073 --> 00:05:30,800
Of all the needs
your beneficiaries may have

107
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:34,273
which ones
are you actually addressing?

108
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:38,271
At this level
it is also important to reflect

109
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:42,345
what your real priorities are
for your enterprise activity.

110
00:05:43,247 --> 00:05:46,324
Is it impact first-and-above profit?

111
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:49,750
If so, that may mean
you may be prepared

112
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:51,205
to give up higher profits

113
00:05:52,067 --> 00:05:54,484
in order to achieve more impact.

114
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:58,038
<i>Coming back to profit,
before we said that profit</i>

115
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:00,066
<i>was necessary, in general,</i>

116
00:06:00,507 --> 00:06:02,699
<i>to ensure
long-term viability.</i>

117
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:06,509
<i>But remember profit can be used 
in various ways.</i>

118
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:11,383
<i>In the most common case,
profit is a self-serving benefit,</i>

119
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:12,084
<i>if you like,</i>

120
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:14,432
<i>where the excess revenues received,</i>

121
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,245
<i>may be appropriated
to a few shareholders</i>

122
00:06:18,445 --> 00:06:19,723
<i>of the enterprise.</i>

123
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,088
<i>Alternatively,
all the profit can simply be</i>

124
00:06:23,688 --> 00:06:25,719
<i>reinvested into the enterprise.</i>

125
00:06:26,047 --> 00:06:28,336
<i>And in this case
be regarded as an engine</i>

126
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:31,086
<i>for growing
the scale of the impact.</i>

127
00:06:31,989 --> 00:06:36,390
<i>This is usually the case for a lot
of not-for-profit foundations,</i>

128
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:37,648
<i>for example.</i>

129
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:40,194
So this part of the canvas

130
00:06:40,609 --> 00:06:44,225
allows for you to consider
and factor in these issues here.

131
00:06:45,219 --> 00:06:48,472
Later on we'll also discuss
the issue of trying to strike

132
00:06:48,672 --> 00:06:51,435
 a balance between the financial,

133
00:06:51,804 --> 00:06:53,908
environmental and social aspects

134
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:56,743
when doing a cost/benefit analysis

135
00:06:57,173 --> 00:06:58,415
for the enterprise.

136
00:06:58,872 --> 00:07:02,471
So to summarize,
thus far we emphasize once more

137
00:07:02,754 --> 00:07:04,490
the importance
of correctly understanding

138
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,245
who your beneficiaries are,
their needs

139
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:09,976
and which ones you are aiming for.

140
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:14,637
And making sure in the process
not to confuse the beneficiary

141
00:07:15,078 --> 00:07:18,280
and the customers as always being
the same entity.

142
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:20,518
For example,

143
00:07:21,634 --> 00:07:24,634
the beneficiaries can be
all those patientes

144
00:07:24,834 --> 00:07:28,017
who are resistant
to antibiotics,

145
00:07:28,629 --> 00:07:31,904
who may stand to benefit
from your new pharmaceutical product

146
00:07:32,422 --> 00:07:34,264
that is effective
with all bacteria.

147
00:07:34,978 --> 00:07:38,790
In this case, you will generally
never sell to the actual beneficiary,

148
00:07:39,262 --> 00:07:40,711
which is the patient, directly.

149
00:07:41,157 --> 00:07:43,364
But your customers
are rather the wholesalers

150
00:07:43,812 --> 00:07:46,557
and distributors,
state health departments

151
00:07:46,757 --> 00:07:48,126
or health insurance companies,

152
00:07:48,477 --> 00:07:51,664
who accept to pay for your product
when prescribed.

153
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:56,021
And finally,
we would like to remind you also

154
00:07:56,221 --> 00:07:59,606
that enterprise values and mission
are very important aspects

155
00:08:00,004 --> 00:08:02,010
for you to define early.

156
00:08:02,855 --> 00:08:04,615
They will help you determine
what is priority

157
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:07,916
for your enterprise,
between impact and profit,

158
00:08:08,095 --> 00:08:10,257
which may have consequences
on how you define

159
00:08:10,723 --> 00:08:13,524
