1
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:19,914
We have now come
to the end of this course

2
00:00:20,114 --> 00:00:22,940
on technology innovation
for sustainable development.

3
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,203
We have seen the important role

4
00:00:25,403 --> 00:00:27,793
of technology in development
or lack thereof,

5
00:00:27,993 --> 00:00:31,686
and discussed those technologies
we considered to be essential.

6
00:00:31,886 --> 00:00:35,244
We have also seen that the context
in low and middle-income countries

7
00:00:35,444 --> 00:00:36,584
is rather specific.

8
00:00:36,784 --> 00:00:40,511
And technologies developed elsewhere
without taking in consideration

9
00:00:40,711 --> 00:00:44,331
the specificity of this context
run a high risk of failure.

10
00:00:44,531 --> 00:00:48,800
We have also insisted
on the importance of co-development

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,458
and collaboration
as absolutely mandatory.

12
00:00:52,658 --> 00:00:53,612
Finally,

13
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:56,995
we presented to you
three fundamental tools

14
00:00:57,195 --> 00:00:59,270
which will help you
de-risk your project

15
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:03,817
and help you towards creating
impactful and sustainable ventures

16
00:01:04,017 --> 00:01:05,167
for your technology.

17
00:01:05,367 --> 00:01:05,947
That is,

18
00:01:06,147 --> 00:01:11,969
One, the impact canvas,
Two, the product value chain.

19
00:01:12,169 --> 00:01:12,972
And finally,

20
00:01:13,172 --> 00:01:15,328
the sustainable business model
canvas.

21
00:01:15,528 --> 00:01:18,943
All three are important
and complementary.

22
00:01:19,181 --> 00:01:22,387
Let's take a step back
and consider the potential impact

23
00:01:22,587 --> 00:01:27,097
on sustainable development arising
from the entrepreneurial approach

24
00:01:27,297 --> 00:01:28,634
we have discussed.

25
00:01:28,834 --> 00:01:31,027
We believe that the approach
we have presented

26
00:01:31,227 --> 00:01:34,340
has the potential to bring about
change at a large scale.

27
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:37,786
Because it does not stop
at the technology development stage.

28
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:41,112
In addition to developing
technology solutions

29
00:01:41,312 --> 00:01:43,899
that match the needs
and context of the poor,

30
00:01:44,099 --> 00:01:46,183
we also presented an approach

31
00:01:46,383 --> 00:01:49,274
to sustainably deploy
and scale up the technology.

32
00:01:49,474 --> 00:01:53,915
This is actually often
and by far the most difficult part

33
00:01:54,115 --> 00:01:54,982
in innovation.

34
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:58,957
Our assumption is that
a well thought-out business model

35
00:01:59,157 --> 00:02:00,678
led by an astute entrepreneur

36
00:02:00,878 --> 00:02:03,472
can really create impactful
and durable solutions.

37
00:02:03,672 --> 00:02:05,380
Why do we think it works?

38
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:05,883
Well.

39
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:08,812
It works because this has shown
to be successful

40
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:10,612
in industrialized countries.

41
00:02:10,812 --> 00:02:13,417
There is no reason
why an entrepreneurial approach

42
00:02:13,617 --> 00:02:15,780
can't work in low-income countries.

43
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,850
Quite the opposite.

44
00:02:17,050 --> 00:02:20,757
Just go to the streets Yaoundé,
Lagos or Nairobi.

45
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:22,040
And you will see

46
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,542
how vibrant and dynamic

47
00:02:23,742 --> 00:02:26,259
the entrepreneurial spirit
is in these places.

48
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:28,149
Everything gets sold or leased

49
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:30,538
by people who have
a great sense of business.

50
00:02:30,713 --> 00:02:34,888
What this MOOC hopes to achieve,
is to steer entrepreneurial culture

51
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,285
which is present everywhere,

52
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:38,507
towards addressing unmet needs

53
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:40,237
in low and middle-income
countries.

54
00:02:40,362 --> 00:02:42,917
It is our hope that this MOOC
can contribute

55
00:02:43,117 --> 00:02:45,341
to increasing
the sheer mass of innovators,

56
00:02:45,454 --> 00:02:48,282
having effective tools
and a sound approach.

57
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:52,165
Which will increase the chances
of successful breakthroughs.

58
00:02:52,365 --> 00:02:55,027
Another question you
might ask yourself is,

59
00:02:55,114 --> 00:02:57,967
how innovation aimed
at solving the unmet needs

60
00:02:58,079 --> 00:03:00,346
of low-income countries
could also benefit

61
00:03:00,546 --> 00:03:01,692
the rest of the world?

62
00:03:01,892 --> 00:03:02,654
As we have seen,

63
00:03:02,854 --> 00:03:05,533
developing technologies
for low-resource settings,

64
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,870
entails addressing
the issue of scarcity

65
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,188
at multiple levels.

66
00:03:09,388 --> 00:03:12,849
Not only scarcity at the level
of essential technologies,

67
00:03:13,049 --> 00:03:16,129
but also scarcity at the level
of financial resources,

68
00:03:16,329 --> 00:03:18,954
skilled personnel
and proper infrastructure.

69
00:03:19,154 --> 00:03:23,632
Basically such a situation requires,
and is likely to lead to, solutions

70
00:03:23,832 --> 00:03:26,605
that are more affordable,
less complex,

71
00:03:26,805 --> 00:03:29,108
and use less consumables.

72
00:03:29,571 --> 00:03:30,788
Remember,

73
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:33,444
consumables not only
generate higher costs,

74
00:03:33,644 --> 00:03:37,290
but also plenty of waste
that must be disposed of.

75
00:03:37,528 --> 00:03:41,221
A process which typically generates
greenhouse emissions

76
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,742
above and beyond
the carbon emissions

77
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:46,323
indirectly derived
from transportation

78
00:03:46,523 --> 00:03:49,575
of high volumes of consumables.

79
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:51,255
Therefore,

80
00:03:51,455 --> 00:03:53,933
it is the reason why we need
more robust technologies

81
00:03:54,045 --> 00:03:54,873
for thess settings, 

82
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:58,210
as they will have
longer life-cycles,

83
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,240
leading to less disposals,

84
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:06,262
which overall will enable to reduce
their total cost of ownership, 

85
00:04:06,462 --> 00:04:08,604
and thus make them more affordable.

86
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:13,528
The lack of skilled personnel
also forces us to rethink

87
00:04:13,728 --> 00:04:15,991
the complexity of the technology.

88
00:04:16,191 --> 00:04:19,247
"Can we make it simpler to use?"

89
00:04:19,447 --> 00:04:22,729
This rethinking will contribute
to reducing misuse

90
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:27,272
and will improve adoption
of essential technologies overall.

91
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,311
And finally,

92
00:04:29,511 --> 00:04:34,454
the lack of certain basic resources
and quality infrastructure,

93
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:36,348
such as water and electricity,

94
00:04:36,548 --> 00:04:39,436
is a driver for low
consumption solutions,

95
00:04:39,636 --> 00:04:42,983
which consume
less electricity or water

96
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:44,425
and are less dependent

97
00:04:44,625 --> 00:04:48,496
on existing
expensive infrastructures.

98
00:04:48,696 --> 00:04:52,777
By now you will certainly
have noticed that the benefits

99
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:57,021
from solutions that are supposedly
designed to overcome challenges

100
00:04:57,221 --> 00:05:01,725
in low-income context, are in fact
potentially of high interest

101
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:04,604
in high-income countries as well!

102
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:08,090
Making products
that are cost effective,

103
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,559
simple to use,
and low-consumption,

104
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,182
are highly desirable
features today globally,

105
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:19,150
as we face population growth
and climate change issues.

106
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:20,727
Therefore,

107
00:05:20,927 --> 00:05:23,047
the approach and tools
that you have learned

108
00:05:23,247 --> 00:05:24,818
in this course
will hopefully

109
00:05:25,018 --> 00:05:28,284
not only benefit society
in low-income countries,

110
00:05:28,484 --> 00:05:30,480
but rather the whole world.

111
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:36,069
Because the innovations
required today and tomorrow,

112
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:37,050
world over,

113
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:43,052
needs to be cost effective
but also sustainable and impactful,

114
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:45,668
Which would be
your own contribution

115
00:05:45,868 --> 00:05:47,885
to the sustainable
development goals.

116
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:49,687
As a final word,

117
00:05:49,887 --> 00:05:53,539
I go back to the wide gap
in the standards of living

118
00:05:53,739 --> 00:05:56,075
between developed
and less-developed regions,

119
00:05:56,275 --> 00:05:58,412
such as Sub-Saharan Africa,
for example.

120
00:05:58,612 --> 00:06:01,442
The strong correlation
we typically see

121
00:06:01,642 --> 00:06:04,126
between the level of access
to essential technologies

122
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:08,281
and the quality of life,
or poverty levels, is striking,

123
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:10,626
and provides
a persuasive illustration

124
00:06:10,826 --> 00:06:13,710
of the important role
and contribution of technologies

125
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:16,148
to the overall quality
of life in society.

126
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:23,499
However, while technology has served
industrialized regions well,

127
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,218
the choice and use of many less
or ill-advised technology approaches

128
00:06:28,418 --> 00:06:32,517
has come back to haunt us by way
of massive environmental cost

129
00:06:32,717 --> 00:06:34,292
we see today.

130
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:38,956
But the flip side for the still
less-industrialized communities

131
00:06:39,156 --> 00:06:43,471
is that technology innovation
actually represents an opportunity

132
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,455
for these communities
to leapfrog themselves.

133
00:06:46,655 --> 00:06:47,894
For example,

134
00:06:48,094 --> 00:06:49,788
today in Nairobi,

135
00:06:49,988 --> 00:06:54,605
you can find several street traders
who are barely literate

136
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:58,390
but are quite adept at carrying out
various banking operations

137
00:06:58,590 --> 00:06:59,888
from their mobile phones.

138
00:07:00,088 --> 00:07:05,019
Thus these countries have already
leapfrogged the rest of the world

139
00:07:05,219 --> 00:07:08,289
because today only
a very small fraction

140
00:07:08,489 --> 00:07:12,046
of the industrialized, typically
tertiary educated population

141
00:07:12,246 --> 00:07:15,738
are using - or even
able to do mobile banking.

142
00:07:16,513 --> 00:07:17,935
So you,

143
00:07:18,135 --> 00:07:21,722
as the new generation of innovation
experts and entrepreneurs

144
00:07:21,922 --> 00:07:24,775
not only can and should leapfrog

145
00:07:24,975 --> 00:07:26,856
the bottom
of the pyramid especially,

146
00:07:27,056 --> 00:07:31,151
but you can and should
also learn from, and correct,

147
00:07:31,351 --> 00:07:36,518
past mistakes of unsustainable
technology-based practices.

148
00:07:36,718 --> 00:07:41,022
Therefore my final word,
and final message to you

149
00:07:41,222 --> 00:07:44,618
is that: go out and seize
this golden opportunity:

150
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:48,939
Go innovate for the economy,
innovate for society,

151
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:50,923
and innovate for the planet.

152
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:54,505
Adding to what my good friend
Soli just said,

153
00:07:54,705 --> 00:07:58,551
I would like to conclude by calling
you all to become entrepreneurs.

154
00:07:58,751 --> 00:08:02,747
You don't need to be an academic
or to have completed an MBA

155
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:04,506
in a prestigious business school.

156
00:08:04,706 --> 00:08:08,912
All you need is your intelligence
and your determination to succeed.

157
00:08:09,112 --> 00:08:12,969
Trying to help the poorest in this
world is a strong motivation.

158
00:08:13,169 --> 00:08:13,907
However,

159
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:18,200
it is essential to keep our goal
in mind at all times,

160
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,289
as success can steer us away
from our initial target.

161
00:08:22,489 --> 00:08:25,859
We strongly encourage you to start
your project right away.

162
00:08:26,059 --> 00:08:27,903
Because the adventure is great,

163
00:08:28,103 --> 00:08:29,566
and the goal is crucial.

164
00:08:29,766 --> 00:08:33,947
We would be very grateful to you
if you agreed to update us

165
00:08:34,147 --> 00:08:37,506
about what you are discovering,
about what works,

166
00:08:37,706 --> 00:08:40,198
and what could be improved
in the methodology.

167
00:08:40,398 --> 00:08:45,457
We sincerely believe that you know
everything you need to know by now,

168
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:49,047
and for the rest, you will learn it
as you progress with your project

169
00:08:49,247 --> 00:08:52,397
and collaborate
with the members of your team.

170
00:08:52,597 --> 00:08:55,200
The ball is in your court.

171
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:56,742
Finally,

172
00:08:56,942 --> 00:09:00,897
we would like to thank the MOOC team
who made this course possible.

173
00:09:01,097 --> 00:09:04,467
All of them have spend numerous
hours working on this MOOC with us,

174
00:09:04,667 --> 00:09:06,798
and we're very grateful to them.

175
00:09:06,998 --> 00:09:11,913
We would like to give special thanks
to Matthieu Gani and Olivier Chappuis

176
00:09:12,113 --> 00:09:14,473
who worked with us
on the content of the course.

177
00:09:14,673 --> 00:09:19,173
We also would like to express
our gratitude to Sophie Inglin,

178
00:09:19,373 --> 00:09:23,879
who captured all the local videos
