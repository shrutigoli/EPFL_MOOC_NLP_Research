1
00:00:10,074 --> 00:00:14,386
Hello. In this video we will 
recapitulate the methodology

2
00:00:14,586 --> 00:00:17,913
applicable to what we called 
the feasibility phase.

3
00:00:18,113 --> 00:00:22,626
The objective of this phase is to
demonstrate the feasibility of our

4
00:00:22,826 --> 00:00:27,508
concept. This involves a technology
side and a business side as we

5
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:32,732
have seen. This phase is where we
need to remove all the unknowns

6
00:00:32,932 --> 00:00:37,755
and risks we can. Because the next
step is when our concept will be

7
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:40,593
deployed. And, hopefully, scaled-up.

8
00:00:40,793 --> 00:00:45,812
The best way to do that is to
test our concept and hypothesis

9
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:50,840
with stakeholders. In the previous
phase we have identified the

10
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:56,377
stakeholders and we have brought
together a project team which

11
00:00:56,577 --> 00:01:02,775
includes diverse competences such as
engineers, marketers, specialists

12
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:05,127
and key opinion leaders. 

13
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:09,836
Very importantly we have also
involved local people

14
00:01:10,036 --> 00:01:14,604
from the pilot country which we have
selected in the previous phase.

15
00:01:14,804 --> 00:01:19,487
We also need to keep in mind that
we will want to deploy our

16
00:01:19,687 --> 00:01:24,363
technology not only in the pilot
country, but also in other regions

17
00:01:24,563 --> 00:01:28,030
where there is the same unmet need.

18
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:31,694
Let us now look into this phase
in more details. 

19
00:01:31,894 --> 00:01:36,223
In the first phase we have developed
specifications that describe our

20
00:01:36,423 --> 00:01:41,000
technology. We now need to verify
that this technology is really

21
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,676
feasible within those specifications.

22
00:01:44,876 --> 00:01:49,019
Demonstrating technological 
feasibility will generally require

23
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:52,821
that we develop and test some
prototypes.

24
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:57,167
When develop those prototypes, we
must constantly verify that our

25
00:01:57,367 --> 00:02:02,180
choices are compliant with our
specifications. This technology

26
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:05,933
development task will need to be
properly documented.

27
00:02:06,133 --> 00:02:11,388
It is important to write down all
the choices we make and why we make

28
00:02:11,588 --> 00:02:16,372
those choices. There are chances
that we will need to refer to these

29
00:02:16,572 --> 00:02:20,793
documents at a later stage. In 
particular, when we need to make

30
00:02:20,993 --> 00:02:26,590
changes. It is also very important
that we comply with industrial norms

31
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,892
applicable to our technology as
we have said multiple times

32
00:02:30,092 --> 00:02:32,094
in this MOOC. 

33
00:02:32,294 --> 00:02:37,181
Technology development is not
something that can be done alone.

34
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:42,835
We need to constantly interact with
our stakeholders, 

35
00:02:43,035 --> 00:02:46,522
and especially with the users and
key opinion leaders. 

36
00:02:46,722 --> 00:02:50,540
We can easily see why this is
important.

37
00:02:50,740 --> 00:02:54,568
There will always have to be 
tradeoffs and these tradeoffs

38
00:02:54,768 --> 00:02:58,039
need to be validated with the key
stakeholders. 

39
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,032
There is a simple memory trick to
remember the most frequent

40
00:03:02,232 --> 00:03:05,298
tradeoffs we will have to make.

41
00:03:05,498 --> 00:03:09,505
We call it the CPD triangle.

42
00:03:09,705 --> 00:03:15,138
For every choice we need to make
we will need to balance essentially

43
00:03:15,338 --> 00:03:20,098
three things: the functionality or
performance of our technology, 

44
00:03:20,298 --> 00:03:24,829
the cost and the durability.

45
00:03:25,029 --> 00:03:29,570
It is generally impossible to
maximize all three of these criteria

46
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:34,121
at the same time. So that we will
need to find an acceptable

47
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:39,523
compromise. Prototypes are immensely
useful in these regards, 

48
00:03:39,723 --> 00:03:44,310
as they can be used to assure that
we have properly understood

49
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:50,361
user needs. Let's look into these
with some examples taken from our

50
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,308
X-ray project. 

51
00:03:52,508 --> 00:03:57,240
During the feasibility phase of the
X-ray project it was determined that

52
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,683
the user interface needed to be 
tested in details.

53
00:04:00,883 --> 00:04:06,079
This user interface involved a touch
screen and a software allowing to

54
00:04:06,279 --> 00:04:10,929
operate the X-ray system as well
as to acquire, store and review the

55
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:17,951
images. The team developed a 
suitcase-like design which involved

56
00:04:18,151 --> 00:04:21,949
the command touchscreen and the 
diagnostics screen. 

57
00:04:22,149 --> 00:04:26,726
A first version of the software was
developed and integrated into the

58
00:04:26,926 --> 00:04:32,761
prototype. The goal was only to
test how the user would respond to

59
00:04:32,961 --> 00:04:35,923
the architecture of the 
menus and buttons. 

60
00:04:36,123 --> 00:04:41,194
In the second picture you can see
the prototype being tested in Cameroon

61
00:04:41,394 --> 00:04:46,338
by a local radiographer on the right,
under the supervision of the joint

62
00:04:46,538 --> 00:04:51,163
project manager Dr. Moulion Tapouh
on the left, who is a Cameroonian

63
00:04:51,363 --> 00:04:56,674
radiologist. The radiographer is
given a classic type of task

64
00:04:56,874 --> 00:05:01,869
such as taking a radiography of
a limb, and every click is recorded

65
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,431
as well as the sequence in which
he operates the software. 

66
00:05:05,631 --> 00:05:09,876
At the end of the test he's 
questioned for his impressions

67
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:11,707
and comments. 

68
00:05:11,907 --> 00:05:16,067
In this particular case the team
came to realize that the software

69
00:05:16,267 --> 00:05:20,989
had many flaws and needed a quite
important redesign in order to be

70
00:05:21,189 --> 00:05:27,106
more user friendly. This was an
important learning for the team.

71
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:32,431
In our second example the question
was to determine the best mechanical

72
00:05:32,631 --> 00:05:36,906
configuration allowing to position
the detector on the X-ray tube

73
00:05:37,106 --> 00:05:41,098
with respect to the patient.
A swivel arm solution had been

74
00:05:41,298 --> 00:05:46,176
chosen by the engineering team. 
However, it was crucial to determine

75
00:05:46,376 --> 00:05:50,434
which were the patient positions
that were possible and those

76
00:05:50,634 --> 00:05:55,544
that were not with this solution.
The problem was solved using

77
00:05:55,744 --> 00:06:01,640
a wooden prototype which was
presented to Professor NKO'O,

78
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,455
who is a widely recognized opinion
leader in radiology, and a partner in

79
00:06:06,655 --> 00:06:09,232
the project from the beginning. 

80
00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:14,342
Several additional workshops were
realized which allowed to accurately

81
00:06:14,542 --> 00:06:18,931
determine the mechanical functions
and necessary degrees of freedom for

82
00:06:19,131 --> 00:06:25,172
the design. As demonstrated in this
example it is not necessary to build

83
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:30,850
sophisticated prototypes to verify
specific feasibility aspects. 

84
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:37,156
We can use any kind of simple 
material such as wood or cardboard

85
00:06:37,356 --> 00:06:40,950
to assess even complex questions.

86
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:45,551
A second important point I would
like to emphasize is that it is

87
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:49,902
generally not advisable to wait
until we have a complete prototype

88
00:06:50,102 --> 00:06:53,221
before showing it to our 
stakeholders.

89
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:59,419
Building rough-and-ready prototypes
in order to test only the specific

90
00:06:59,619 --> 00:07:05,368
aspects for which we have doubts
is a great way to remove unknowns.

91
00:07:05,568 --> 00:07:09,994
Yet another nice way to test our 
ideas is to make drawings. 

92
00:07:10,194 --> 00:07:14,256
Here the team wanted to explore 
ideas related to the configuration

93
00:07:14,456 --> 00:07:19,307
of the whole X-ray system including
the patient bed, and the lead screen

94
00:07:19,507 --> 00:07:22,656
behind which the radiographer
will be operating the device.

95
00:07:22,856 --> 00:07:29,743
These drawings brought about many
discussions with many stakeholders.

96
00:07:29,943 --> 00:07:34,628
Here's finally a more advanced 
prototype of the X-ray system.

97
00:07:34,828 --> 00:07:39,679
Note that the industrial design 
aspects have not been integrated yet

98
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,109
and that this is not a final product
for which much more work needs to

99
00:07:44,309 --> 00:07:49,307
be done. However, this prototype has
allowed to conduct many tests

100
00:07:49,507 --> 00:07:53,952
including realizing real X-ray 
images of a human hand. 

101
00:07:54,152 --> 00:07:58,433
Of course, the human hand was a
skeleton hand incapsulated in resin,

102
00:07:58,633 --> 00:08:03,379
which allows to mimic a real hand.
It would not have been ethically or

103
00:08:03,579 --> 00:08:09,181
legally acceptable to make tests on
real humans before all the regulatory

104
00:08:09,381 --> 00:08:14,442
approvals are obtained. In these 
slides we have only discussed

105
00:08:14,642 --> 00:08:19,211
technical feasibility. And yet we 
know that the business model is also

106
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:22,933
extremely important. Let us look
into this.

107
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:27,083
The fundamental question we need
to answer at this stage is

108
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:31,656
the following. Is our value 
proposition attractive to potential

109
00:08:31,856 --> 00:08:37,468
buyers? As we have seen, the buyers
and the beneficiaries may be two

110
00:08:37,668 --> 00:08:39,324
different groups. 

111
00:08:39,524 --> 00:08:44,753
We need to make sure that our value
proposition is both attractive

112
00:08:44,953 --> 00:08:48,569
and that it allows to fulfill the 
unmet need. 

113
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:54,629
We need to go out and test our value
proposition with the very people

114
00:08:54,829 --> 00:08:59,843
who will pay for it and those who
will benefit from it.

115
00:09:00,043 --> 00:09:05,541
This process is extremely important.
And will more often than not lead

116
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:10,241
to adjustments and modification
to our value proposition.

117
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:15,034
In practice, this may involve 
presenting a prototype to a group of

118
00:09:15,234 --> 00:09:19,564
potential buyers. And carefully 
recording their reactions.

119
00:09:19,764 --> 00:09:24,226
In marketing this is called a
focus group.

120
00:09:24,426 --> 00:09:28,225
Selecting the right sample of
participants can be quite difficult

121
00:09:28,425 --> 00:09:34,327
as one has to be careful not to
introduce biases such as involving

122
00:09:34,527 --> 00:09:39,087
someone from the design team who
would skew the discussions.

123
00:09:39,287 --> 00:09:43,413
Focus groups can be very useful.
For example, to test pricing

124
00:09:43,613 --> 00:09:49,992
hypotheses. One can even evaluate
the price sensitivity of the buyer

125
00:09:50,192 --> 00:09:53,623
which is very important for our
economic viability.

126
00:09:53,823 --> 00:09:58,622
Of course, there are many other ways
to collect quantitative and

127
00:09:58,822 --> 00:10:03,229
qualitative user feedbacks. 
Such as using well-designed surveys.

128
00:10:03,429 --> 00:10:09,179
Whatever the method, what counts is
to carefully plan how the value

129
00:10:09,379 --> 00:10:14,816
proposition will be tested and later
to honestly analyze the results.

130
00:10:15,016 --> 00:10:19,867
The trap here is not to fall in love
with your solution, but to really

131
00:10:20,067 --> 00:10:24,046
listen to what people say even
if that means making important

132
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:26,132
changes. 

133
00:10:26,332 --> 00:10:31,272
Finally, depending on the technology
it would be absolutely great to

134
00:10:31,472 --> 00:10:36,730
have written preorders. Not only 
does this prove that the technology

135
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:41,317
is attractive and that the pricing
is right, but it will also allow you

136
00:10:41,517 --> 00:10:45,620
to demonstrate that you have 
identified a potentially highly

137
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,702
interesting business opportunity.

138
00:10:48,902 --> 00:10:54,849
This is absolutely invaluable when
you will want to convince investors

139
00:10:55,049 --> 00:10:58,648
to finance your project at a later
stage. 

140
00:10:58,848 --> 00:11:03,349
If you're a really good sales person
you may even try to obtain a

141
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:07,915
downpayment which may help you
finance your development and

142
00:11:08,115 --> 00:11:13,153
deployment. This is typically what
you're trying to achieve with

143
00:11:13,353 --> 00:11:15,310
crowdsourcing websites. 

144
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:18,639
Another subject that must be 
carefully tested during the

145
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,839
feasibility phase is our product
value chain. 

146
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:26,619
In particular, we need to test what
are the conditions under which our

147
00:11:26,819 --> 00:11:30,217
partners will supply a component
or provide a service.

148
00:11:30,417 --> 00:11:35,944
Typically this is done by requesting
written offers from our partners.

149
00:11:36,144 --> 00:11:40,935
These offers will allow us to
decide if it is more favorable to

150
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:45,369
purchase the component or service,
or if it is better to provide it

151
00:11:45,569 --> 00:11:50,912
ourselves. This is very important
as we need to consolidate our cost

152
00:11:51,112 --> 00:11:55,064
targets and to estimate the 
profitability of the company.

153
00:11:55,264 --> 00:12:00,107
Finally, once we have confirmed our
strategy, we need to go back to the

154
00:12:00,307 --> 00:12:04,925
sustainable business model canvas.
And balance our triple bottom line.

155
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:09,508
Remember as a principle, all 3
bottom lines should be neutral

156
00:12:09,708 --> 00:12:14,649
at the very least. Our initiative is
ethically questionable if the social

157
00:12:14,849 --> 00:12:19,599
benefit is lower than the social 
cost. Or if to get a social impact

158
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:21,656
you're destroying the environment.

159
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:26,850
It is assuredly bound to fail if the
revenue streams do not allow you to

160
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:32,663
cover the costs. At this stage it is
also very important that we think

161
00:12:32,863 --> 00:12:35,749
global. This is, of course, 
not simple.

162
00:12:35,949 --> 00:12:39,999
Indeed, as we get better and better
at understanding our pilot context,

163
00:12:40,199 --> 00:12:43,898
there is a risk that our product and
strategy won't be applicable

164
00:12:44,098 --> 00:12:48,879
elsewhere. As we have said in the
past videos, we should think about

165
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,665
how our technology could be made
available wherever it is needed, 

166
00:12:52,865 --> 00:12:56,956
which could be all of low and
middle-income countries. 

167
00:12:57,156 --> 00:13:02,909
In the feasibility phase it is thus
very important that we benchmark 

168
00:13:03,109 --> 00:13:05,169
against other contexts. 

169
00:13:05,369 --> 00:13:10,287
For example, how attractive would
our concept of X-ray machine be

170
00:13:10,487 --> 00:13:13,024
in Asia or South America?

171
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:18,242
In order to do that, we can contact
local NGOs or local universities

172
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:21,303
and engineering schools to help us.

173
00:13:21,503 --> 00:13:26,216
It would be a pity if failing to 
introduce a small change at this

174
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:31,799
stage would hinder a large fraction
of the world's poor from getting

175
00:13:31,999 --> 00:13:35,150
access to our technology. 

176
00:13:35,362 --> 00:13:41,127
Our three tools, the impact canvas,
the product value chain, and

177
00:13:41,327 --> 00:13:46,048
the sustainable business model
canvas can be a convenient way

178
00:13:46,248 --> 00:13:50,435
to communicate our strategy to
stakeholders in other contexts.

179
00:13:50,635 --> 00:13:56,754
At this stage we also need to update
our impact metrics based on the

180
00:13:56,954 --> 00:13:58,484
impact canvas. 

181
00:13:58,684 --> 00:14:02,272
An important aspect that we did not
discuss up to now is the

182
00:14:02,472 --> 00:14:04,059
communication strategy. 

183
00:14:04,259 --> 00:14:08,476
By the time we have a reasonably
clear concept and strategy, it will

184
00:14:08,676 --> 00:14:11,418
become very important to spread the
word. 

185
00:14:11,618 --> 00:14:16,580
Here you can see the two project
managers presenting the X-ray

186
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,216
prototype in a public show. 

187
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,691
There are many channels you can use.

188
00:14:21,891 --> 00:14:26,785
Such as the internet, social media,
radio, TV, etc. 

189
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:32,059
Short video pictures are great
communication tools which can

190
00:14:32,259 --> 00:14:35,548
basically be made with very little
resources. 

191
00:14:35,748 --> 00:14:40,047
Be careful though, that this won't
interfere with your patent strategy

192
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:43,332
as we have explained in a previous
video. 

193
00:14:43,532 --> 00:14:47,800
Raising public awareness of the 
problem you are trying to solve

194
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:51,940
can allow you to attract crucial
partners and potentially also

195
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:57,027
investors or other organizations
who could be ready to support you

196
00:14:57,227 --> 00:15:01,747
financially. The issue of raising
adequate funding for your project

197
00:15:01,947 --> 00:15:03,700
is always a problem. 

198
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:07,722
However, multiple funding sources
exist. 

199
00:15:07,922 --> 00:15:13,085
Ranging from crowdsourcing to
international organizations, or

200
00:15:13,285 --> 00:15:18,088
foundations. If universities or 
engineering schools are involved

201
00:15:18,288 --> 00:15:23,091
you may be able to convince them
to apply for a research grant

202
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,236
in collaboration with you.

203
00:15:25,436 --> 00:15:29,021
Fundraising can be really 
frustrating at times.

204
00:15:29,221 --> 00:15:34,058
But that is also where you can
demonstrate how strongly you believe

205
00:15:34,258 --> 00:15:39,189
in your idea. You need to hang-in
there and find creative ways to

206
00:15:39,389 --> 00:15:41,702
convince funders to support you.

207
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:47,533
Having a good communication
strategy will almost always turn out

208
00:15:47,733 --> 00:15:50,129
to be helpful in these regards. 

209
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:55,740
As a summary, here are the main
deliverables which must be available

210
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:58,209
at the end of the feasibility phase.

211
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:02,431
First, a detailed and validated 
product specification.

212
00:16:02,631 --> 00:16:06,997
Then data demonstrating that
the technology is feasible

213
00:16:07,197 --> 00:16:09,167
according to the specifications. 

214
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:13,936
A finalized prototype which 
incorporates all potential changes

215
00:16:14,136 --> 00:16:16,079
made in this phase. 

216
00:16:16,279 --> 00:16:21,156
And a receipt of your patent
application if that is applicable.

217
00:16:21,356 --> 00:16:26,430
Finally, a complete business plan
describing your project and

218
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:31,034
business model. This document
doesn't need to be many pages.

219
00:16:31,234 --> 00:16:35,468
It should be quite easy to write
based on your reflections in this

220
00:16:35,668 --> 00:16:41,751
phase. Simply start by summarizing
the content of your 3 tools.

221
00:16:41,951 --> 00:16:45,947
The impact canvas, the product
value chain canvas, and the

222
00:16:46,147 --> 00:16:48,629
sustainable business model canvas.

223
00:16:48,829 --> 00:16:54,901
However, our advice is: don't lose
too much time on this document.

224
00:16:55,101 --> 00:16:57,709
Make it crisp and attractive. 

225
00:16:57,909 --> 00:17:00,632
It will be useful for 
the next phase.

226
00:17:00,832 --> 00:17:02,116
Goodbye.
