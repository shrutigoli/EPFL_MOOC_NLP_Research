1
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:18,876
Now that you've had a chance
to go through all the tools

2
00:00:19,076 --> 00:00:20,255
we've discussed in the course,

3
00:00:20,684 --> 00:00:24,075
we wanted to come back
and try to tie things together.

4
00:00:24,902 --> 00:00:27,358
I'll start by reminding you briefly
about the overall 

5
00:00:27,558 --> 00:00:29,473
technology innovation process.

6
00:00:29,673 --> 00:00:32,070
Basically, the technology
innovation process

7
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:38,587
comprises three broad phases: the concept,
feasibility, and the implementation phases.

8
00:00:38,787 --> 00:00:42,532
Phase one is the concept development
phase, which involves

9
00:00:42,732 --> 00:00:46,888
a variety of issues, such as:
defining your mission,

10
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:53,122
choosing your pilot country origin,
engaging local stakeholders,

11
00:00:53,322 --> 00:00:59,021
taking stock of alternative products,
and then defining your product specs.

12
00:00:59,706 --> 00:01:02,248
Phase two is
the feasibility phase

13
00:01:02,448 --> 00:01:04,702
where you attempt to test
and demonstrate

14
00:01:04,902 --> 00:01:07,674
the feasibility of your product
concept and business model.

15
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:11,434
This may end up requiring you
to readjust your product concepts

16
00:01:11,634 --> 00:01:12,858
and business strategy.

17
00:01:13,058 --> 00:01:15,929
And phase three
is about implementation

18
00:01:16,129 --> 00:01:18,771
that is actually bringing
the products to the market,

19
00:01:18,971 --> 00:01:22,183
where you will aim to reach
your break even stage,

20
00:01:22,383 --> 00:01:24,570
and then scaling up to other region.

21
00:01:25,244 --> 00:01:27,770
This is also the phase where
you will need to diligently

22
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:31,040
 carry out impact monitoring
activities, in order to ensure 

23
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:34,742
that you advance towards
your original mission.

24
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:38,527
For each of the phases there
is one key message:

25
00:01:39,569 --> 00:01:43,257
For the concept phase
the main message is to LEARN,

26
00:01:43,936 --> 00:01:47,366
for the feasibility phase the main
message is to COLLABORATE 

27
00:01:47,898 --> 00:01:52,707
while for implementation
we say "BE AGILE".

28
00:01:53,895 --> 00:01:57,900
For the rest of this lecture we'll
only focus on the Concept phase.

29
00:01:59,073 --> 00:02:02,065
The concept phase can
be broadly divided into the following parts

30
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:04,601
which are:
1) Define your mission,

31
00:02:04,801 --> 00:02:11,629
2)Define and engage your stakeholders,
3) Assess existing alternatives

32
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:11,001


33
00:02:11,829 --> 00:02:14,915
and competition and understand
why they are falling short,

34
00:02:15,115 --> 00:02:20,939
4) Define the specification or specs of
the solution you have identified.

35
00:02:22,059 --> 00:02:25,001
Naturally, the first task for you
is to define your mission,

36
00:02:25,201 --> 00:02:28,419
in other words: What problem
are you trying to solve, 

37
00:02:28,619 --> 00:02:30,999
and what change do
you want to achieve?

38
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:33,747
After you have done that,
then you need to go back 

39
00:02:33,947 --> 00:02:37,559
and do some background research,
in order the verify

40
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:42,126
 that what you wish to solve
is indeed a real problem.

41
00:02:43,091 --> 00:02:46,994
So, after you are satisfied
with the validity of the problem

42
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:51,373
then you must decide what is
the technology innovation solution

43
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:55,471
 you wish to propose
to address the problem,

44
00:02:55,671 --> 00:02:59,853
with a view to achieving your
desired change in the long term.

45
00:03:02,096 --> 00:03:05,252
Then, after that, you need
to understand and define

46
00:03:05,452 --> 00:03:08,447
who your stakeholders are exactly,

47
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:14,427
in other words, who are the direct and
indirect contributors or beneficiaries,

48
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:19,129
or said differently, who will
affect and/or be affected

49
00:03:19,329 --> 00:03:23,216
by the activities of your organization
when implementing your solution?

50
00:03:25,014 --> 00:03:29,694
Afterwards, create a Stakeholders'
Rating Table and identify

51
00:03:29,894 --> 00:03:32,306
 the ones who are absolutely key,
for example,

52
00:03:32,506 --> 00:03:37,172
those scoring high on interest
and power to affect your solution.

53
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:42,229
But also identify those capable
of influencing perceptions 

54
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:46,942
and opinion on your solution,
that is the Key Opinion Leaders.

55
00:03:47,834 --> 00:03:52,010
Engage them as extensively
as feasible, in order to understand

56
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:56,166
what type of solution they
really wish to see for this problem.

57
00:03:56,366 --> 00:04:02,890
Now, discuss your proposed solution
and find out what their opinion is

58
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,885
 and what feedback
they can give you on it.

59
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:13,973
Once you have satisfactorily defined and verified the problem 

60
00:04:14,173 --> 00:04:17,368
and the change you ultimately aim
to achieve using your

61
00:04:17,568 --> 00:04:21,851
proposed technology solution, then
you need to define the activities

62
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:25,421
required to get
to the required change.

63
00:04:25,621 --> 00:04:28,215
This pathway of activities must
include deliverables

64
00:04:28,415 --> 00:04:32,781
and milestones along the way,
as well as the metrics and methods

65
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:35,920
to measure and monitor them.

66
00:04:36,082 --> 00:04:39,120
Now, if you think back to
the first tool we introduced, 

67
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:43,076
namely the Impact Canvas,
you will see right away that

68
00:04:43,276 --> 00:04:47,226
 it is the ideal tool to enable you
to carry out 

69
00:04:47,426 --> 00:04:48,711
the process we mentioned above.

70
00:04:49,918 --> 00:04:53,738
As you can see, the process of
defining your mission is very akin

71
00:04:53,938 --> 00:04:59,256
to the theory of change methodology
in the impact plan development.

72
00:05:01,554 --> 00:05:04,113
Therefore, the first key deliverable
for you

73
00:05:04,313 --> 00:05:06,526
during the concept development phase

74
00:05:06,726 --> 00:05:10,241
is the Impact Plan
or the Impact Framework.

75
00:05:11,928 --> 00:05:15,316
Note that in order to help you
map out your stakeholders

76
00:05:15,516 --> 00:05:19,735
a high level non-detailed analysis
of the product value chain

77
00:05:19,935 --> 00:05:22,222
 is the tool we recommend. 

78
00:05:23,767 --> 00:05:27,106
Now that you have defined
your technology solution concept,

79
00:05:27,306 --> 00:05:28,987
the key question you have to address

80
00:05:29,187 --> 00:05:31,603
is where you intend
to launch your product first,

81
00:05:31,803 --> 00:05:34,680
in other words,
what will be your pilot market?

82
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:38,225
Even though our intention in this
course is to develop products

83
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:40,735
that eventually have as global a
reach as possible,  

84
00:05:40,935 --> 00:05:43,928
you must first learn to walk
before you can run.

85
00:05:44,128 --> 00:05:49,674
Therefore, it is advisable to pinpoint
a pilot market prior to scaling up.

86
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:54,532
So, here we encourage you to think
global but at local, initially!

87
00:05:54,732 --> 00:05:56,774
And we constantly remind you of this

88
00:05:56,974 --> 00:05:59,916
philosophy throughout
the innovation process.

89
00:06:01,564 --> 00:06:04,420
There are various factors to take
into consideration 

90
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,860
when making this decision,
and here the PESTLE analysis

91
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:11,489
in the market part of the product
value chain tool

92
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:14,690
 will be particularly useful
in helping you map out 

93
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,795
key original parameters that may
have an impact 

94
00:06:17,995 --> 00:06:20,791
on your product's success
or lack thereof.

95
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:25,288
It is also important to start off with
a country you know reasonably well

96
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:29,116
and where you have good and reliable
contacts.

97
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,369
And for this reason, many tend
to choose their home

98
00:06:32,569 --> 00:06:36,621
or domicile market initially,
after all, charity begins at home, 

99
00:06:36,821 --> 00:06:37,948
as they say in English.

100
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,295
But this need not
necessarily be the case,

101
00:06:40,495 --> 00:06:44,197
choosing a pilot market is important,
because it will allow you

102
00:06:44,397 --> 00:06:47,399
 to go deeper and more specific in
your assessment 

103
00:06:47,599 --> 00:06:51,112
and understanding of customer needs
and get more concrete data

104
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:53,295
about your technology solution.

105
00:06:53,799 --> 00:06:56,966
However, you must also guard against
over-tailoring your solution 

106
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:59,990
to that specific region
to the extent that

107
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:03,668
it becomes irrelevant
outside that territory.

108
00:07:03,868 --> 00:07:07,178
So try and select a country
or region that is as representative

109
00:07:07,158 --> 00:07:10,158


110
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:10,644
as possible of the global community
you wish to address

111
00:07:10,844 --> 00:07:11,982
 with your solution.

112
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:16,113
In the case of the digital X-Ray
project that we discussed, for example,

113
00:07:16,313 --> 00:07:20,026
Cameroon was chosen because
it was deemed to be sufficiently

114
00:07:20,226 --> 00:07:24,327
representative of the challenges
we wished to address that are faced 

115
00:07:24,527 --> 00:07:27,917
by low and middle income countries
with respect to radiology

116
00:07:28,117 --> 00:07:30,412
access and infrastructure.

117
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:34,100
You need to have a good
understanding of the status quo,

118
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,210
in other words, how are
the intended beneficiaries 

119
00:07:37,410 --> 00:07:39,911
currently obtaining the
benefit you wish to provide?

120
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:43,253
In most cases there is generally
an existing mechanism that 

121
00:07:43,453 --> 00:07:46,885
people try and obtain
an essential service or benefit from,

122
00:07:47,085 --> 00:07:49,418
even if it's not
to their satisfaction.

123
00:07:50,456 --> 00:07:53,962
Make a maximum effort to discuss
with and understand what 

124
00:07:54,162 --> 00:07:58,331
the clients do appreciate about it
and what they genuinely miss.

125
00:07:58,531 --> 00:08:01,911
Be sure that whatever is missing
is what one might term 

126
00:08:02,111 --> 00:08:06,532
"A must-have" rather than
a "Nice-to-have" service or benefit.

127
00:08:08,002 --> 00:08:10,531
In order to help you
with this particular process

128
00:08:10,731 --> 00:08:15,246
we recommend using
the Porter 5 forces analysis

129
00:08:15,446 --> 00:08:17,521
in conjunction
with desktop research.

130
00:08:17,721 --> 00:08:21,496
As we said before, this will help
you understand where power lies

131
00:08:21,696 --> 00:08:25,277
in the market place, as well as
understand your potential strength

132
00:08:25,477 --> 00:08:28,514
 in the market you will be
considering moving into.

133
00:08:29,941 --> 00:08:33,790
Before you move to the next step,
for technology innovation 

134
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:39,142
it is generally very important to understand
the intellectual property landscape

135
00:08:39,342 --> 00:08:40,369
surrounding your solution.

136
00:08:40,569 --> 00:08:43,939
Even if you do not wish to file
a patent, you still need to be sure

137
00:08:44,139 --> 00:08:46,696
that you have what
is termed "Freedom to operate".

138
00:08:46,896 --> 00:08:50,243
However, there are still many
regions in the developing world

139
00:08:50,443 --> 00:08:54,866
who have weak intellectual property
laws, which may render even

140
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:57,152
a valid patent ineffective.
ineffective.

141
00:08:57,352 --> 00:09:01,540
Consequently, many players simply do
not designate these regions when

142
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,989
filing patents. 

143
00:09:03,734 --> 00:09:06,086
However, the PESTLE analysis
should, in principle, provide

144
00:09:06,286 --> 00:09:09,776
you the the relevant intellectual
laws for your pilot region,

145
00:09:09,976 --> 00:09:13,549
you can then make the call
on the intellectual property issue.

146
00:09:13,749 --> 00:09:16,029


147
00:09:16,928 --> 00:09:19,562
After carrying out
the detailed process above,

148
00:09:19,762 --> 00:09:21,541
you are now ready to start drafting

149
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:24,307
your initial product
specifications or specs.

150
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:28,751
This exercise is best done as a group
with your colleagues, for example.

151
00:09:29,624 --> 00:09:33,140
If you have the opportunity,
make sure to also include

152
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:36,833
some key opinion leaders
and other relevant stakeholders

153
00:09:37,033 --> 00:09:41,195
as this might also generate a sense
of ownership for the eventual product.

154
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:45,623
Getting such an early buy-in from
key opinion leaders and stakeholders

155
00:09:45,823 --> 00:09:49,449
could pay off handsome dividends
for you, as they are likely 

156
00:09:49,649 --> 00:09:52,240
to be comfortable and
willing to advocate for the product.

157
00:09:54,543 --> 00:09:59,076
Once you're satisfied with this version,
we recommend that you put it through

158
00:09:59,276 --> 00:10:02,386
 the low and middle income country
context assessment tool

159
00:10:02,586 --> 00:10:05,454
that we discussed earlier,
in order to determine 

160
00:10:05,654 --> 00:10:08,579
how adapted your solution
will potentially be 

161
00:10:08,779 --> 00:10:14,011
in their anticipated contexts. 
And if required, revise and alter the specs,

162
00:10:14,211 --> 00:10:15,755
in order to comply with this context.

163
00:10:16,475 --> 00:10:18,413
Finally, you should carry out
a SWOT Analysis, 

164
00:10:18,613 --> 00:10:22,865
in order to have a global overview
of products position. In addition,

165
00:10:23,065 --> 00:10:26,065
do also carry out a SWOT Analysis
on the current team

166
00:10:26,265 --> 00:10:28,866
to assess what strengths
are already available

167
00:10:29,066 --> 00:10:31,651
and which vital competences
are missing

168
00:10:31,851 --> 00:10:34,619
to successfully develop
the product concept.

169
00:10:35,162 --> 00:10:37,809
Now based on your product's specs,
try and identify the 

170
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:41,170
top two or three potential markets
opportunities

171
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:44,281
that could be addressed
with your product's specs.

172
00:10:44,967 --> 00:10:47,066
And then, with the help of
the information you have collected 

173
00:10:47,266 --> 00:10:50,120
from the impact plan
and product value chain analysis

174
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:54,557
carry out the exercise of filling out
the sustainable business model canvas

175
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:56,725
for each of the product options
separately.

176
00:10:56,925 --> 00:11:00,920
This will allow you to construct
various business models scenarios

177
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,588
that could result from your product.

178
00:11:04,381 --> 00:11:07,048
And for each business opportunity
you should develop 

179
00:11:07,248 --> 00:11:12,388
a corresponding value proposition.
Ideally, you should carry out

180
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,294
this exercise as a group, involving
your colleagues

181
00:11:15,494 --> 00:11:17,949
and any other relevant players
or stakeholders

182
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:19,346
that you may have access to.

183
00:11:20,985 --> 00:11:25,890
Just remember that, the more diverse
the participants the better the outcome.

184
00:11:26,841 --> 00:11:29,249
The process of carrying out
the activities we discussed

185
00:11:29,449 --> 00:11:33,471
in the previous slides requires that
you spend an excessive amount of time

186
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:35,198
if you wish to do it well.

187
00:11:36,174 --> 00:11:39,454
Therefore, in most cases it can be
very difficult to do it

188
00:11:39,654 --> 00:11:43,109
as a part-time activity
and requires full-time commitment.

189
00:11:44,229 --> 00:11:47,833
But depending on your personal
situation many people require

190
00:11:48,033 --> 00:11:51,263
income for a living, and so,
the question begs as to 

191
00:11:51,463 --> 00:11:54,212
how do you finance yourself
during this phase?

192
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:59,059
I will say upfront that there is
no easy answer, unfortunately, 

193
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:03,274
to this question, especially
at this early stage.

194
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:09,262
At this stage, traditional sources of finance
such as the banks, businesses angels  

195
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:13,063
and venture capital are not likely
to take any interest

196
00:12:13,263 --> 00:12:15,961
as it is too early-stage for them.

197
00:12:17,131 --> 00:12:22,887
So, the number one source is you,
that is, your personal investments.

198
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:27,374
This includes not only any financial
expenditures you can make,

199
00:12:27,574 --> 00:12:31,948
but the time, resources and
the sacrifices you need to make.

200
00:12:33,017 --> 00:12:36,402
This also includes all days and
nights you may spend in your garage

201
00:12:36,602 --> 00:12:39,118
testing out numerous technical
concepts.

202
00:12:40,607 --> 00:12:44,617
Your number two source is likely
to be the so called the "Three F's": 

203
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:47,040
Friends, Family and Fools.

204
00:12:48,463 --> 00:12:52,326
They may be able to lend you money,
for example, to carry out the trips

205
00:12:52,526 --> 00:12:55,426
and visits to meet the important
stakeholders,

206
00:12:55,626 --> 00:12:59,808
or also by just allowing you
to continue to stay with them

207
00:13:00,008 --> 00:13:02,674
without paying boarding
and lodging costs,

208
00:13:03,362 --> 00:13:07,201
or simply giving you a downright
lump sum of money,

209
00:13:07,401 --> 00:13:11,571
in return for equity
or a convertible loan.

210
00:13:13,171 --> 00:13:16,355
And depending on where you are
there may be a variety of grants

211
00:13:16,555 --> 00:13:19,494
for supporting early stage
startup companies.

212
00:13:20,814 --> 00:13:23,868
But, generally speaking, cash grants
for the concept development phase

213
00:13:24,068 --> 00:13:25,120
are rare.

214
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,710
However, there are several kinds
of support instruments,

215
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:39,383
such as Business Plan competition,
incubator and/or enterprise accelerators.

216
00:13:40,347 --> 00:13:44,122
These instruments typically provide
in kind support of by way of giving you

217
00:13:44,322 --> 00:13:48,398
access to expertise to help you
develop your product concept

218
00:13:48,598 --> 00:13:52,154
as well as infrastructure such as
physical space

219
00:13:52,354 --> 00:13:53,677
and IT.

220
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:58,648
So, to summarize what outputs
or deliverables should you plan

221
00:13:58,848 --> 00:14:00,738
to have from the concept phase?

222
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:05,187
The first tool you used is 
the Impact Framework tool, 

223
00:14:05,387 --> 00:14:08,847
which then provides you with
your Impact Plan as a deliverable.

224
00:14:09,623 --> 00:14:12,108
And then you applied
the Product Value Chain analysis,

225
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:16,683
to give you a more comprehensive list
of stakeholders and key opinion leaders.

226
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:22,109
And finally, your product specs
or product concept.

227
00:14:23,372 --> 00:14:26,871
And then the sustainable business
model canvas enabled you

228
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:31,294
to develop suitable business models
for each of the identified product

229
00:14:31,494 --> 00:14:33,086
options from your product specs.

230
00:14:34,565 --> 00:14:40,332
So, in general you will have noticed
how many times we encouraged 

231
00:14:40,532 --> 00:14:43,784
the interaction with/and
participation of stakeholders

232
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:47,697
 in the various processes we have
discussed in this lecture.

233
00:14:48,593 --> 00:14:50,959
That is because this is really
the phase when

234
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:54,850
it's vitally important that you put
together as accurate a concept

235
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:58,820
as possible before you go further
with the arduous process of

236
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:00,521
product development.

237
00:15:01,064 --> 00:15:03,472
So again, we cannot over-emphasize

238
00:15:03,672 --> 00:15:06,313
the need to involve
them in this phase.

239
00:15:06,513 --> 00:15:07,541
Goodbye.
