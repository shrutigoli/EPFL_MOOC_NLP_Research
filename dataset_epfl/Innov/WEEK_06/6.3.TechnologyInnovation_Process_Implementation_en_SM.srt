1
00:00:15,987 --> 00:00:19,990
Now you've reached the point where
you've completed your developments

2
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,348
and must now launch a product.

3
00:00:22,998 --> 00:00:26,310
You must now find a mechanism 
to deploy your innovation

4
00:00:26,510 --> 00:00:28,496
which is effective
as much as possible.

5
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:29,938
How do you go about that?

6
00:00:30,138 --> 00:00:31,926
Well that's
the million dollar question.

7
00:00:32,126 --> 00:00:34,758
Or rather shall I say,
the billion dollar question.

8
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:38,621
Remember, poverty affects well 
over 2 billion people.

9
00:00:38,821 --> 00:00:43,276
Therefore, you have to keep in mind
that whatever innovation you develop

10
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,895
has to have the ambition
and capacity

11
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:48,046
to reach millions
of the affected people,

12
00:00:48,246 --> 00:00:51,608
if you wish to achieve any
appreciable impact.

13
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:56,659
Now this lecture is not intended
to be a comprehensive tutorial

14
00:00:56,859 --> 00:00:58,825
on how to carry out this process;

15
00:00:59,025 --> 00:01:02,515
That's beyond our scope
with the timeframe we have.

16
00:01:02,715 --> 00:01:04,798
What we wish to do, instead,

17
00:01:04,885 --> 00:01:08,048
is to orient you and equip you
with the right mindset

18
00:01:08,248 --> 00:01:11,870
on what to consider when planning
for this stage.

19
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:14,001
Let's first look at the notion

20
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:16,372
of life-cycle
of technology adoption.

21
00:01:16,572 --> 00:01:20,393
Rogers attempted to describe this
via a theory termed,

22
00:01:20,593 --> 00:01:22,010
"The Diffusion of Innovations."

23
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:26,053
Diffusion of Innovations is a theory
that seeks to explain how,

24
00:01:26,253 --> 00:01:29,703
why and at what rate new ideas
and technology spread?

25
00:01:29,903 --> 00:01:33,887
This theory was popularized
by Prof. Everett Rogers in his book

26
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:36,316
that was first published in 1962,

27
00:01:36,516 --> 00:01:38,824
and is now in its fifth edition
and beyond.

28
00:01:39,024 --> 00:01:42,691
The process of adoption over time
is typically illustrated

29
00:01:42,804 --> 00:01:44,445
as a classical, 
normal distribution

30
00:01:44,546 --> 00:01:46,160
or "bell curve".

31
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,599
The model indicates that

32
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,541
the first group of people to use
a new product are called Innovators,

33
00:01:52,741 --> 00:01:53,940
which you see on the left.

34
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,025
Followed by Early Adopters.

35
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:58,964
Next come the Early Majority,

36
00:01:59,164 --> 00:02:00,839
and Late Majority,

37
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:04,202
and the last group to eventually
adopt a product are called Laggards.

38
00:02:04,402 --> 00:02:07,521
Unfortunately, in reality,
the majority of innovations

39
00:02:07,624 --> 00:02:10,533
never make it past
the early adopters stage!

40
00:02:10,733 --> 00:02:14,647
So what can you possibly do
to enhance the chances of success

41
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,867
beyond this stage
for your innovation?

42
00:02:17,067 --> 00:02:20,052
There are various strategies
and concepts being proposed,

43
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:21,802
but we will discuss two main

44
00:02:22,002 --> 00:02:24,618
compelling and enduring
schools of thought.

45
00:02:24,818 --> 00:02:26,540
As we said before,

46
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,003
at this stage,

47
00:02:28,203 --> 00:02:30,757
you have developed the proof
of concept for your innovation.

48
00:02:30,957 --> 00:02:34,202
And you now wish to deploy
a product in the market.

49
00:02:34,909 --> 00:02:38,283
This is generally a very tricky step
for technologists and scientists,

50
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:40,370
because typically
technology innovations 

51
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,082
can seemingly have endless

52
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:44,747
interesting features
or applications in principle.

53
00:02:44,947 --> 00:02:49,350
But in reality, probably only 20%
of those features 

54
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:52,182
or potential applications
really matter in the market.

55
00:02:53,994 --> 00:02:56,133
So what that means

56
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,540
is that rather than
spending your time and resources

57
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:02,957
over-engineering your product
with unnecessary features,

58
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:06,513
you should rather focus
on the features that really matter.

59
00:03:06,713 --> 00:03:11,054
That is the philosophy underlining
the increasingly popular approach

60
00:03:11,254 --> 00:03:13,705
in technology innovations,
especially.

61
00:03:13,905 --> 00:03:16,816
This is the Principle
of Lean Innovation.

62
00:03:17,516 --> 00:03:21,564
Lean innovation embraces
a philosophy of not letting

63
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:24,483
perfection get
in the way of progress,

64
00:03:24,683 --> 00:03:26,126
as Tom Agan puts it.

65
00:03:26,326 --> 00:03:29,723
Lean innovation contrasts
conventional approaches

66
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,905
to product development,

67
00:03:31,105 --> 00:03:34,794
where R&D teams
expend enormous effort

68
00:03:34,994 --> 00:03:38,181
trying to create a perfected
multi-featured product

69
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:39,986
over an extended period,

70
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:44,155
without any sufficient actual
market customer or feedback.

71
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:49,239
The resulting products are often 
too expensive, too complicated,

72
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,245
too different
from what customers want,

73
00:03:52,445 --> 00:03:53,633
and worst of all,

74
00:03:53,833 --> 00:03:56,031
too late to market.

75
00:03:57,574 --> 00:04:01,342
When thinking about lean innovation,
it is perhaps useful

76
00:04:01,511 --> 00:04:04,626
to take into consideration
something I just alluded to.

77
00:04:04,826 --> 00:04:06,208
The Pareto principle.

78
00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:10,623
Which states that,
20% of the invested inputs

79
00:04:10,823 --> 00:04:14,489
are responsible for 80%
of the results obtained.

80
00:04:14,689 --> 00:04:18,612
This is also referred to
as the 80:20 rule.

81
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:21,439
What does that mean
for your product?

82
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:26,037
It means that potentially
20% of the product's features

83
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:31,022
may most likely deliver 80%
of the benefits sought by customers.

84
00:04:31,222 --> 00:04:34,934
So your first crucial challenge

85
00:04:35,134 --> 00:04:40,533
is to spend time identifying 
which 20% of your product's features

86
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,590
can fulfill this criterion?

87
00:04:43,003 --> 00:04:44,872
Once you have done that

88
00:04:45,072 --> 00:04:48,007
you will have defined
what could be termed

89
00:04:48,207 --> 00:04:53,869
the Minimum Viable Product,
and we'll call it MVP, for short.

90
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:58,142
We now look at the concept
of the Minimum Viable Product

91
00:04:58,342 --> 00:05:00,037
in a more holistic perspective.

92
00:05:00,237 --> 00:05:02,814
Essentially, what you have
had until now

93
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:05,957
is rather an idea or hypothesis.

94
00:05:06,157 --> 00:05:09,462
Which is in fact based
on the analysis you carried out

95
00:05:09,662 --> 00:05:10,911
with the Product Value Chain

96
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:14,214
and Sustainable Business
Model Canvas early on.

97
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:18,098
So a minimum viable product
is actually that version 

98
00:05:18,198 --> 00:05:21,292
of your new product that you utilize
in the process of collecting 

99
00:05:21,492 --> 00:05:24,492
a maximum of information
about your hypothesis,

100
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:27,745
but using a minimum of resources.

101
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:30,623
The process itself is actually

102
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:34,366
a build, measure and learn,
feedback loop.

103
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:38,787
The build part of the feedback loop,

104
00:05:38,987 --> 00:05:41,151
involves a process
of building a product

105
00:05:41,351 --> 00:05:43,048
with only the core features

106
00:05:43,248 --> 00:05:44,972
or minimum feature set.

107
00:05:45,172 --> 00:05:47,508
For example, you can do this

108
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,568
by first listing and ranking

109
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:53,398
all the features that you really
believe your product should have.

110
00:05:53,598 --> 00:05:56,817
And then simply apply
the Pareto rule,

111
00:05:57,017 --> 00:06:00,234
and select the top 20 percentile
of that list,

112
00:06:00,434 --> 00:06:04,790
to become the minimum feature set
of your minimum viable product.

113
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:10,087
You then have to identify
a sub-segment of your market,

114
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,845
the visionaries or early adopters,

115
00:06:13,045 --> 00:06:15,981
that you will sell
your minimum viable products to.

116
00:06:16,894 --> 00:06:20,795
And that information
may or should be obtainable

117
00:06:20,995 --> 00:06:23,193
from the analysis
that you carried out

118
00:06:23,393 --> 00:06:27,041
with your sustainable business
model canvas tool before.

119
00:06:27,653 --> 00:06:29,522
And this sub-segment could include

120
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:32,533
some of the stakeholders
and key opinion leaders 

121
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:35,733
who actually helped you define
your product, for example.

122
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:38,646
And when selling
the product to them,

123
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:40,919
you may still want
to make them aware

124
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:44,031
of all the other features
your product may have later on.

125
00:06:45,044 --> 00:06:47,304
Therefore, you'd be doing

126
00:06:47,504 --> 00:06:52,543
what one of the well-known
proponents of lean innovations,

127
00:06:52,743 --> 00:06:55,490
Steve Blank, calls
"Perfection by Subtraction".

128
00:06:55,690 --> 00:06:57,735
You'd be selling the vision

129
00:06:57,935 --> 00:07:00,733
and delivering
the minimum feature set

130
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:03,503
to visionaries and not everyone.

131
00:07:04,258 --> 00:07:06,552
An important point
to remember in our case

132
00:07:06,752 --> 00:07:08,667
is that we are also after impact.

133
00:07:08,867 --> 00:07:11,567
So you also need to ask yourself,

134
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,200
are the features
of your minimum viable product

135
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,016
also relevant and core to your
impact objectives?

136
00:07:17,216 --> 00:07:20,228
However, based on the manner
you defined your Product Specs

137
00:07:20,366 --> 00:07:23,495
when applying the sustainable
business model canvas tool,

138
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:26,489
there is a high likelihood that your
minimum viable product 

139
00:07:26,689 --> 00:07:30,117
will also match your impact
objectives anyway.

140
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:33,896
The next phase is the Measure phase,

141
00:07:34,096 --> 00:07:35,899
whose aim is to validate

142
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:38,313
that our product development
activities thus far

143
00:07:38,513 --> 00:07:41,127
are indeed inline
with our hypothesis

144
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:44,571
of what we believe
the target customer group wants.

145
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:46,864
And the other task you have,

146
00:07:47,064 --> 00:07:48,398
includes measuring your indicators

147
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,381
from your impact framework,

148
00:07:52,581 --> 00:07:54,767
in order to verify
if, indeed,

149
00:07:54,967 --> 00:07:58,534
you're obtaining the results
you hypothesized. 

150
00:07:58,734 --> 00:08:00,083
And here,

151
00:08:00,283 --> 00:08:04,114
there are various feedback points
we can receive or learn from.

152
00:08:04,314 --> 00:08:07,929
Which brings us to the important
or critical phase of Learning.

153
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:10,360
Remember,
bringing in a new innovation

154
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,588
to the market
is actually an experiment.

155
00:08:12,788 --> 00:08:17,120
Albeit a marketplace experiment,
rather than a laboratory one.

156
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:20,461
So, learning from the first phase
of your experiments

157
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:22,539
provides you the necessary knowledge

158
00:08:22,739 --> 00:08:26,245
that brings you closer
to your ultimate hypothesis.

159
00:08:26,445 --> 00:08:28,839
Or in this case, the final product.

160
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,674
So one of the key questions here,
is to really determine 

161
00:08:32,874 --> 00:08:35,539
even with this subset
customer segment

162
00:08:35,739 --> 00:08:39,620
that somebody actually wants
what we are building.

163
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:43,489
As well as what other features
should be added.

164
00:08:43,689 --> 00:08:46,166
How product development
should continue?

165
00:08:46,366 --> 00:08:50,072
And if it turns out
that no one wants this,

166
00:08:50,272 --> 00:08:54,507
then no amount of continued
and over-engineering down this path

167
00:08:54,707 --> 00:08:55,682
will help.

168
00:08:55,882 --> 00:08:58,414
And this is a very important
point to learn.

169
00:08:58,614 --> 00:09:00,612
And in that case, we should pivot.

170
00:09:00,812 --> 00:09:04,811
In other words, abandon this path,
and take a different direction.

171
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,730
Without expending
generally scarce resources.

172
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,764
And as was mentioned earlier on,

173
00:09:11,964 --> 00:09:15,187
rather fail them early,
and fail them cheap!

174
00:09:15,387 --> 00:09:16,627
Therefore,

175
00:09:16,827 --> 00:09:22,508
by applying the necessary iterations
of the build, measure & learn feedback loop

176
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:24,182
on your minimum viable product,

177
00:09:24,382 --> 00:09:26,862
you should eventually
optimize and refine 

178
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,485
your final product offering,

179
00:09:28,685 --> 00:09:31,774
as well as fine-tune
your impact framework

180
00:09:31,974 --> 00:09:34,108
or impact value chain,
if necessary.

181
00:09:34,308 --> 00:09:37,308
Now you have finally defined
your best products.

182
00:09:37,508 --> 00:09:40,973
And you have actually managed
to get some sales traction 

183
00:09:41,073 --> 00:09:43,479
with a handful, or even hundreds
of customers.

184
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,532
So, if we look
at the technology adoption curve,

185
00:09:46,732 --> 00:09:48,652
you have what we call,
early adopters,

186
00:09:48,852 --> 00:09:52,127
which are indicated in red
on the curve on the screen.

187
00:09:52,327 --> 00:09:53,890
But remember, as we said earlier,

188
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:57,549
most innovation products
never make it past this stage

189
00:09:57,749 --> 00:09:58,979
of early adopters.

190
00:09:59,179 --> 00:09:59,817
Why?

191
00:10:00,017 --> 00:10:01,816
Well, it turns out that in practice

192
00:10:02,016 --> 00:10:05,016
it is so much harder penetrating
the next market segment

193
00:10:05,216 --> 00:10:06,715
of the early majority.

194
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:09,790
Primarily because early adopters
and early majority 

195
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:13,115
have two vastly different
commercial mindsets.

196
00:10:13,315 --> 00:10:16,615
It is not a smooth
and seamless transition.

197
00:10:16,815 --> 00:10:18,648
as the technology adoption curve

198
00:10:18,848 --> 00:10:21,848
I showed you earlier
from Rogers' theory might suggest.

199
00:10:22,048 --> 00:10:25,594
Instead, there is what
Jeffrey Moore has famously coined,

200
00:10:25,794 --> 00:10:26,805
 as a "Chasm".

201
00:10:26,951 --> 00:10:31,711
A chasm between early adopters
and the early majority.

202
00:10:31,911 --> 00:10:34,077
In his book, "Crossing the Chasm",

203
00:10:34,277 --> 00:10:37,277
Moore says that,
the early majority are pragmatists,

204
00:10:37,477 --> 00:10:41,883
share some of the early adopters'
ability to relate to technology,

205
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:45,950
but they are driven
by a strong sense of practicality.

206
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:49,430
They want to see
well-established references

207
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:52,113
before investing substantially.

208
00:10:52,313 --> 00:10:54,713
But because there are so many people
in this segment,

209
00:10:54,913 --> 00:10:57,545
roughly one third
of the whole adoption life-cycle,

210
00:10:57,745 --> 00:11:02,740
winning their business is key
to any substantial growth, though.

211
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,802
So this is because
this early majority of pragmatists

212
00:11:06,002 --> 00:11:08,545
care about the company
they are buying from,

213
00:11:08,745 --> 00:11:11,631
the quality of the product
they are buying,

214
00:11:11,734 --> 00:11:14,344
the infrastructure
of supporting products

215
00:11:14,544 --> 00:11:16,243
and system interfaces,

216
00:11:16,443 --> 00:11:20,661
and the reliability of the service
they are going to get.

217
00:11:20,861 --> 00:11:25,161
So the sales-pitch that made you
successful with the innovators,

218
00:11:25,361 --> 00:11:26,885
and early adopters,

219
00:11:27,085 --> 00:11:30,166
will not necessarily work
with the pragmatists

220
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:31,848
or early majority.

221
00:11:32,048 --> 00:11:34,012
Now to cross this chasm,

222
00:11:34,212 --> 00:11:36,205
Moore proposes a whole methodology.

223
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:38,662
But we will not cover it
in detail here,

224
00:11:38,787 --> 00:11:40,515
but rather encourage you
to read the book,

225
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,385
which is referenced at the end.

226
00:11:42,585 --> 00:11:45,068
The message I essentially
wanted to convey

227
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:47,688
is that there are two
very distinct phases

228
00:11:47,888 --> 00:11:50,997
in launching and adoption
of a technology innovation.

229
00:11:51,197 --> 00:11:55,103
And that the methods needed
to succeed in the second phase

230
00:11:55,303 --> 00:12:00,519
tend to be considerably different
from the ones required

231
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,135
in the first adoption phase.

232
00:12:02,335 --> 00:12:03,896
So in other words,

233
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:06,329
the fact that you succeeded
in the first phase

234
00:12:06,529 --> 00:12:08,255
with the so-called early adopters,

235
00:12:08,455 --> 00:12:13,057
does not necessarily guarantee
you success in the mass market

236
00:12:13,257 --> 00:12:15,393
of early majority.

237
00:12:15,593 --> 00:12:17,034
Now to summarize,

238
00:12:17,234 --> 00:12:21,007
you might ask yourself the question,
Why these two concepts specifically,

239
00:12:21,207 --> 00:12:23,640
namely, lean innovation
and crossing the chasm?

240
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,980
In fact, you will see that,
if you have noticed already

241
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,442
that these two concepts
are actually complimentary.

242
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:33,027
In lean innovation,
you identify and build

243
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:34,919
your minimum viable product.

244
00:12:35,119 --> 00:12:38,592
And then learn intuitively
from its deployment in the market,

245
00:12:38,792 --> 00:12:40,578
on how to make the best product.

246
00:12:40,778 --> 00:12:43,657
One of the key secrets of success
of lean innovation

247
00:12:43,857 --> 00:12:45,305
is actually embracing learning.

248
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:47,804
As it has been shown
that learning has, by far, 

249
00:12:48,004 --> 00:12:51,247
the single greatest impact
on revenue from new products.

250
00:12:51,447 --> 00:12:54,929
Its focus is in the most
important product attributes.

251
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:57,446
And the rapid cycling,
via trial and error,

252
00:12:57,534 --> 00:12:59,646
helps to accumulate
critical knowledge quickly,

253
00:12:59,846 --> 00:13:03,511
and ideally, in the real life,
competitive environment.

254
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:04,528
In other words,

255
00:13:04,728 --> 00:13:08,082
lean innovation is not necessarily
a better innovation process,

256
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:11,344
rather it is a more efficient
learning process.

257
00:13:11,544 --> 00:13:13,652
Whereas in crossing the chasm,

258
00:13:13,852 --> 00:13:16,766
once you have defined and validated
your best product,

259
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:19,654
you assemble a strategy
for its full rollout,

260
00:13:19,854 --> 00:13:22,000
which should see it reach
hundreds of thousands,

261
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,324
and millions of clients.

262
00:13:24,278 --> 00:13:26,604
If you think of this
as a game of darts

263
00:13:26,804 --> 00:13:28,217
you can think of lean innovation

264
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:30,856
as enabling
the efficient implementation

265
00:13:31,056 --> 00:13:32,705
of the early adoption phase.

266
00:13:32,905 --> 00:13:36,819
Or having to point
the small missile correctly.

267
00:13:37,019 --> 00:13:38,541
While crossing the chasm methods

268
00:13:38,741 --> 00:13:41,363
enables success
with the early majority.

269
00:13:41,563 --> 00:13:46,000
Or give inertia and direction
to your small missile,

270
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,719
to get to the Bull's Eye!

271
00:13:48,403 --> 00:13:50,011
Goodbye.
