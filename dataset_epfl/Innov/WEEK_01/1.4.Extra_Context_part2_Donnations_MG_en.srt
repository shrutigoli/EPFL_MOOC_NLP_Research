1
00:00:06,024 --> 00:00:10,745
Ever since we got this machine it 
hasn't been in good condition.

2
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:16,114
We had several technicians come
to fix it,

3
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:19,623
but they didn't understand.

4
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:22,907
Until now, we are still looking
for ways to repair it

5
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:26,539
we can't find the
parts on the market.

6
00:00:27,757 --> 00:00:30,139
That's why it doesn't work.

7
00:00:30,324 --> 00:00:36,414
Since we got it, in 2012,

8
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:39,602
that's when it got here!

9
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,994
The other machine I work with

10
00:00:43,218 --> 00:00:44,534
is an old machine

11
00:00:44,759 --> 00:00:47,759
and there is a switch
that doesn't work.

12
00:00:48,006 --> 00:00:54,081
So I tried to work with
it to get he right image.

13
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:57,027
There is a cooperation
between China and Cameroon.

14
00:00:57,423 --> 00:00:59,911
They give us equipment

15
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:01,802
the donations arrive

16
00:01:01,987 --> 00:01:04,926
sometimes with the instructions
fully in Chinese.

17
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:07,146
When you can't see a translator

18
00:01:07,332 --> 00:01:09,979
if you have a translator
he'll translate the language

19
00:01:10,233 --> 00:01:15,722
but he doesn't have the necessary
technical knowledge,

20
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:17,844
so we very often

21
00:01:18,056 --> 00:01:19,726
face this situation,

22
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,554
where our engineers do what they can
to make the equipment work

23
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:25,715
so sometimes they make
mistakes with the plugs and wires

24
00:01:25,971 --> 00:01:27,358
we are often face with

25
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,338
this is the big issue we have
with this type of equipment

26
00:01:30,528 --> 00:01:32,051
These donations of equipment

27
00:01:32,251 --> 00:01:35,901
are often second hand devices,

28
00:01:38,733 --> 00:01:39,896
not adapted

29
00:01:41,087 --> 00:01:45,337
so they'll work for maximum 6 months

30
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,347
and obviously with no transparency

31
00:01:50,805 --> 00:01:54,255
from the customer service
and maintenance team.

32
00:01:55,334 --> 00:01:58,216
Well sometimes it's
very interesting stuff

33
00:01:58,506 --> 00:02:00,449
very interesting

34
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,064
very interesting imagery equipment

35
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:07,589
echograph scanners

36
00:02:07,789 --> 00:02:10,964
and unfortunately

37
00:02:11,872 --> 00:02:13,648
when it's second hand

38
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:18,900
it won't last very long.

39
00:02:21,864 --> 00:02:24,075
The problem of the obsolescence
of the equipment

40
00:02:24,606 --> 00:02:26,906
So the problem is that

41
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:31,968
with these obsolete, outdated
machines

42
00:02:32,968 --> 00:02:35,831
we sometimes have to repeat the 
exam 3, 4 or 5 times

43
00:02:36,103 --> 00:02:38,656
to get what we want

44
00:02:38,918 --> 00:02:40,847
and the final image is approximate,

45
00:02:41,036 --> 00:02:44,323
sometimes we accept one because
we have already tried many times

46
00:02:44,537 --> 00:02:48,662
and there is a double, 
even a triple risk.

47
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:51,982
For the patient, 
who is radiated several times

48
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:56,506
because there is a certain
dose the patient shouldn't exceed

49
00:02:56,856 --> 00:02:58,291
and for yourself,

50
00:02:58,479 --> 00:03:02,208
because at the same time,
the personnel is often unprotected,

51
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:07,599
they don't have leaded screens

52
00:03:07,783 --> 00:03:10,256
they barely have a leaded apron but
that doesn't protect like a screen 

53
00:03:10,653 --> 00:03:11,706
Thirdly,

54
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:14,438
they never have control

55
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,309
of the quantity of radiation they recieve.

56
00:03:21,836 --> 00:03:23,681
The machines come as they are.

57
00:03:23,991 --> 00:03:25,841
we don't know if there are
spare parts

58
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:28,184
and we don't know if we can
find them locally.

59
00:03:28,398 --> 00:03:30,072
So you are given a machine.

60
00:03:30,322 --> 00:03:33,527
You don't have it from the start,
only for the end

61
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,734
You just receive it and you use it.

62
00:03:35,983 --> 00:03:36,893
When it stops,

63
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,712
if you can't find the parts,

64
00:03:38,884 --> 00:03:42,709
you put it aside and look for
another one.

65
00:03:42,915 --> 00:03:45,078
And as long as it doesn't come you
stay like that,

66
00:03:45,252 --> 00:03:46,539
so this is the real problem

67
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:50,771
with these machines we receive.

68
00:03:51,015 --> 00:03:53,554
When the machine gets to us

69
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,748
the spare parts are no longer made

70
00:03:57,933 --> 00:04:01,276
because the machine
isn't fabricated anymore.

71
00:04:01,465 --> 00:04:05,890
So this is a huge problem.

72
00:04:06,072 --> 00:04:11,472
We face constraints that
we cannot solve

73
00:04:11,678 --> 00:04:15,658
and sometimes we are giving
up on the machine

74
00:04:16,295 --> 00:04:17,990
and not knowing what to do.

75
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:21,796
They become what you'd call
the "white elephant in the room".

76
00:04:22,009 --> 00:04:25,009
There is this big 
white elephant there

77
00:04:25,355 --> 00:04:28,528
everyone looks at it 
but it does not work.

78
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:31,665
Sometimes there is equipment

79
00:04:32,412 --> 00:04:35,706
we have to pay to get rid of,

80
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,230
so the term "donation"

81
00:04:39,395 --> 00:04:41,422
could be more like

82
00:04:42,145 --> 00:04:49,198
a transfer of responsibility
from one to another.

83
00:04:50,591 --> 00:04:56,466
So that is a subject we
need to analyse with care

84
00:04:56,641 --> 00:04:58,479
and depth.

85
00:04:58,644 --> 00:05:02,025
The donators have good intentions.

86
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:05,529
But, they give what they have

87
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:10,633
and that can mean
what they want to get rid of,

88
00:05:11,366 --> 00:05:13,466
which doesn't necessarily correspond

89
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:15,792
which often doesn't correspond

90
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:19,747
to the real need from the field.

91
00:05:19,947 --> 00:05:23,385
Either in terms of what we want,

92
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,251
or in terms of reliability,

93
00:05:27,015 --> 00:05:29,265
So they give what they can

94
00:05:29,455 --> 00:05:32,722
because that's what they have, and
maybe they don't use it any more

95
00:05:33,016 --> 00:05:35,329
And we receive it
because they give it to us,

96
00:05:35,515 --> 00:05:36,639
bu maybe we didn't ask for it

97
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,483
and if we asked for
what we really wanted,

98
00:05:38,672 --> 00:05:41,135
they would say "we don't
have that, take this instead."

99
00:05:41,318 --> 00:05:44,981
There is an inadequacy
between what's available

100
00:05:45,161 --> 00:05:48,046
when they donate
and what we really need.
