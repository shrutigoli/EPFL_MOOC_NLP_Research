1
00:00:12,447 --> 00:00:14,471
Hello. The success or failure

2
00:00:14,653 --> 00:00:16,966
of launching and scaling up
a new technology

3
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:19,562
depends heavily on how well
it is adapted

4
00:00:19,746 --> 00:00:21,699
to the context
where it will be used.

5
00:00:22,413 --> 00:00:26,282
In particular, it depends on
the people who will use it

6
00:00:26,467 --> 00:00:29,226
and on the environment,
which can be very harsh.

7
00:00:29,688 --> 00:00:32,498
Low and middle income countries
are different

8
00:00:32,707 --> 00:00:35,177
from industrialized countries
in many ways.

9
00:00:35,563 --> 00:00:38,726
Any innovative technology solution
we will develop

10
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:41,000
will need to take this into account.

11
00:00:41,477 --> 00:00:43,445
The best way to do this

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:46,932
is to collaborate closely
with local stakeholders.

13
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:51,260
We will now look at
a simplified framework,

14
00:00:51,438 --> 00:00:55,834
which captures the main challenges
posed by these contexts.

15
00:00:56,384 --> 00:00:59,613
There are 4 main challenges
in this context

16
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:02,788
and one overarching issue
connected to all of them,

17
00:01:03,006 --> 00:01:04,276
which is poor governance.

18
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,796
As said before,

19
00:01:05,993 --> 00:01:08,908
the context is characterized
by scarcity.

20
00:01:09,323 --> 00:01:11,933
There is a lack
of functioning infrastructure,

21
00:01:12,134 --> 00:01:13,662
a lack of trained personnel

22
00:01:13,847 --> 00:01:15,808
and a lack of financial resources.

23
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:19,086
Of course, these elements
are all interconnected

24
00:01:19,275 --> 00:01:21,789
and interdependent in complex ways.

25
00:01:22,184 --> 00:01:23,339
The harsh environment

26
00:01:23,529 --> 00:01:26,428
is yet another characteristic
of this context

27
00:01:26,605 --> 00:01:28,413
and we will see
how destructive it can be

28
00:01:28,585 --> 00:01:30,160
for essential technologies.

29
00:01:30,393 --> 00:01:33,176
Let us now look at
these different challenges

30
00:01:33,346 --> 00:01:36,497
and explain how they influence
technology innovation.

31
00:01:37,095 --> 00:01:39,238
Scarcity in quality infrastructure

32
00:01:39,424 --> 00:01:41,300
is certainly
a very widespread issue.

33
00:01:41,516 --> 00:01:44,978
Infrastructure provides
the basic physical systems

34
00:01:45,166 --> 00:01:46,107
and structures

35
00:01:46,392 --> 00:01:49,698
essential to the operation
of a society or enterprise.

36
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:51,655
It involves many aspects,

37
00:01:51,842 --> 00:01:54,283
but let me mention some of
the most important ones

38
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,626
in our technology innovation
perspective:

39
00:01:56,918 --> 00:02:00,815
energy, transport, communication
and water infrastructures.

40
00:02:02,428 --> 00:02:05,528
This picture was taken in
a district hospital in Cameroon

41
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:08,809
which has had 6 fires
in only one year,

42
00:02:09,059 --> 00:02:11,870
caused by inadequate
electrical infrastructure.

43
00:02:12,062 --> 00:02:15,112
In both Sub-Saharan Africa
and South Asia,

44
00:02:15,293 --> 00:02:20,292
about 45% of firms identified
reliability of the power supply

45
00:02:20,474 --> 00:02:21,915
and connecting to the grid

46
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,410
as among the key constraints
to doing business.

47
00:02:26,143 --> 00:02:28,011
Africa's informal firms,

48
00:02:28,186 --> 00:02:31,049
who cannot afford a backup
electrical generator,

49
00:02:31,265 --> 00:02:33,869
report that up to 20% of their sales

50
00:02:34,065 --> 00:02:36,520
are lost because of the
frequent power outages.

51
00:02:37,141 --> 00:02:38,782
When power is available,

52
00:02:38,969 --> 00:02:42,406
instabilities such as power spikes
or voltage sags

53
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:44,596
tend to damage electrical equipment.

54
00:02:44,898 --> 00:02:46,420
According to one study,

55
00:02:46,654 --> 00:02:49,869
up to one third of electrical
medical equipment failures

56
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,971
are due to power instabilities.

57
00:02:52,316 --> 00:02:55,478
Designing solutions for that context
will require

58
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,800
that either there is no need
for electrical power at all,

59
00:02:58,984 --> 00:03:01,685
or the technology has
a robust circuitry

60
00:03:01,866 --> 00:03:05,870
allowing it to resist this
destructive electrical environment.

61
00:03:06,407 --> 00:03:09,111
Another challenge is
the lack of availability

62
00:03:09,292 --> 00:03:13,298
of quality transport infrastructure
such as paved roads and railways,

63
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,687
which means that it is
difficult and expensive

64
00:03:16,883 --> 00:03:19,651
to ship a product
to the people who need it.

65
00:03:19,830 --> 00:03:22,440
This is especially problematic
in low-income countries

66
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:23,861
in Sub-Saharan Africa

67
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:27,343
where the paved road density
is less than a quarter

68
00:03:27,663 --> 00:03:29,741
than that of other
low-income countries

69
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:31,677
in Asia, for example.

70
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:35,337
When paved roads are available,
they very quickly degrade

71
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:39,112
due to a destructive combination
of heavy usage, harsh climate

72
00:03:39,283 --> 00:03:40,610
and lack of maintenance.

73
00:03:40,808 --> 00:03:42,766
Supply chains are heavily affected

74
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:45,489
by this lack of
efficient transport infrastructure

75
00:03:45,661 --> 00:03:48,334
which increases costs
and causes delays.

76
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:50,617
Access to
communication infrastructure,

77
00:03:50,804 --> 00:03:52,846
such as mobile telephone network,

78
00:03:53,095 --> 00:03:55,141
has very much improved lately,

79
00:03:55,328 --> 00:03:57,797
while fixed lines
have not grown much.

80
00:03:58,059 --> 00:03:59,322
In 2015,

81
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:03,063
the mobile phone subscription rate
in low and middle income countries

82
00:04:03,307 --> 00:04:05,191
was almost 100%.

83
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:08,738
However, broadband internet is still
largely unavailable

84
00:04:08,925 --> 00:04:10,819
to people
living in those countries,

85
00:04:11,024 --> 00:04:13,674
where less than 1 in 10 people
have access.

86
00:04:13,876 --> 00:04:16,228
Broadband internet backbone networks

87
00:04:16,437 --> 00:04:19,209
need much greater capacity
than voice traffic,

88
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,718
typically using fibre-optic cables

89
00:04:21,896 --> 00:04:24,203
which have generally
not been deployed yet.

90
00:04:24,617 --> 00:04:25,778
As a consequence,

91
00:04:25,951 --> 00:04:29,271
broadband internet is expensive
when it is available at all.

92
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:32,400
It remains typically limited
to major urban areas

93
00:04:32,655 --> 00:04:34,262
and to internet cafÃ©s,

94
00:04:34,452 --> 00:04:37,427
businesses, and high-income
residential customers.

95
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,739
Finally,

96
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:41,956
there is the problem of water
and sanitation infrastructure.

97
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:44,585
Piped water is not accessible

98
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,651
to a large fraction
of the population.

99
00:04:46,837 --> 00:04:50,193
In urban settings in Africa,
in 2005,

100
00:04:50,418 --> 00:04:53,760
about 39% of the population
had piped supply,

101
00:04:53,996 --> 00:04:57,395
as compared to only 4%
in rural areas.

102
00:04:57,584 --> 00:04:59,518
When piped water is available,

103
00:04:59,704 --> 00:05:02,651
supply is often intermittent,
and the quality of the water

104
00:05:02,861 --> 00:05:03,750
can be quite poor.

105
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:07,386
For sanitation as well, there is
a lack of basic infrastructure

106
00:05:07,575 --> 00:05:11,266
such as sewerage systems,
or water treatment solutions.

107
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:14,740
There are more challenges
related to infrastructure,

108
00:05:14,926 --> 00:05:17,819
but these should be remembered
as they will influence

109
00:05:18,029 --> 00:05:20,184
the design
of innovative technologies.

110
00:05:20,698 --> 00:05:23,996
The second challenge is
the lack of trained personnel,

111
00:05:24,166 --> 00:05:24,891
which, of course,

112
00:05:25,061 --> 00:05:28,907
is related to access
to adequate education at all levels.

113
00:05:29,228 --> 00:05:30,489
We have seen that

114
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:34,186
"ensuring inclusive and equitable
quality education for all"

115
00:05:34,419 --> 00:05:37,160
is sustainable development
goal number 4.

116
00:05:37,527 --> 00:05:39,313
Technology is generally developed

117
00:05:39,527 --> 00:05:42,317
thinking that a certain level
of competence to use,

118
00:05:42,499 --> 00:05:44,700
maintain, or repair it
will be available.

119
00:05:44,891 --> 00:05:47,057
When it turns out
not to be the case,

120
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,566
the result is failure.

121
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:50,344
According to the world bank,

122
00:05:50,508 --> 00:05:52,843
in some of the poorest countries,
the share

123
00:05:53,054 --> 00:05:56,511
of primary school graduates
who cannot read a single sentence

124
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,943
ranges between 25-50%.

125
00:06:00,386 --> 00:06:01,227
Today,

126
00:06:01,428 --> 00:06:06,468
50% of the world's working population
are farmers, or self-employed.

127
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,314
Two thirds of them are poor.

128
00:06:08,543 --> 00:06:12,422
They work mainly in activities
such as farming a small plot of land,

129
00:06:12,646 --> 00:06:14,412
selling vegetables on the streets,

130
00:06:14,604 --> 00:06:17,990
sewing clothes or offering
a range of services

131
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:19,616
in urban areas.

132
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:21,574
Firms in developing countries

133
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:25,299
rank acquiring
appropriately skilled workers

134
00:06:25,547 --> 00:06:27,209
as one of their top concerns.

135
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:28,792
However,

136
00:06:28,989 --> 00:06:31,925
providing appropriate
training capacity and opportunity

137
00:06:32,108 --> 00:06:35,108
is not enough to assure that
the skills will be available.

138
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:37,817
When a person receives
adequate training,

139
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,160
he or she will be looking
for a well paid job.

140
00:06:41,608 --> 00:06:44,730
Since such jobs are scarce,
there are chances

141
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,909
that the person won't be able
to work in the domain

142
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:49,520
he or she trained for.

143
00:06:49,939 --> 00:06:52,939
This may result in skilled people
leaving the country

144
00:06:53,161 --> 00:06:56,072
or taking up other jobs
such as driving a taxi.

145
00:06:56,348 --> 00:06:57,689
For example,

146
00:06:57,867 --> 00:07:00,669
in this picture, you can see
a technician responsible

147
00:07:00,855 --> 00:07:04,620
for maintaining and operating
an emergency generator in a hospital.

148
00:07:05,026 --> 00:07:07,340
People like him do the best they can

149
00:07:07,532 --> 00:07:10,171
with the basic,
often self-acquired knowledge

150
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,206
that they've got.

151
00:07:11,378 --> 00:07:13,805
However, if he gets
additional training,

152
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:17,317
there are chances that he will look
for a better paid job elsewhere.

153
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:20,203
and the hospital will need to
find another technician.

154
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,861
As a consequence, as we think of
technology innovation,

155
00:07:24,122 --> 00:07:27,663
it is important to have in mind
that the rotation of skilled labor

156
00:07:27,877 --> 00:07:29,575
can be quite important.

157
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:30,851
In general,

158
00:07:31,032 --> 00:07:33,564
there is a need for solutions
that are simple enough

159
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:36,133
to require little or no training
to start with

160
00:07:36,344 --> 00:07:39,203
for safe and effective operation
of the technology.

161
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:40,812
If that is not possible,

162
00:07:41,017 --> 00:07:43,781
one should think of smart
and affordable solutions

163
00:07:43,968 --> 00:07:46,290
to offer training
and refresher courses

164
00:07:46,461 --> 00:07:47,752
to the people who need them.

165
00:07:49,982 --> 00:07:52,485
Our third challenge
is quite obviously

166
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:54,529
the lack of financial resources.

167
00:07:54,892 --> 00:07:57,796
As illustrated here
in this slum in Haiti

168
00:07:57,985 --> 00:08:00,994
people in countries
we are interested in are poor

169
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:04,146
and we have seen that this poverty
has many dimensions.

170
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:07,375
We need to understand
how these dimensions of poverty

171
00:08:07,557 --> 00:08:10,042
influence the purchase, the use,

172
00:08:10,226 --> 00:08:13,312
the maintenance, the repair and
the decommissioning of the technology

173
00:08:13,504 --> 00:08:15,087
that we are planning to develop.

174
00:08:15,256 --> 00:08:18,256
For example,
in industrialized countries,

175
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:22,288
many solutions involve consumables
such as razor blades,

176
00:08:22,483 --> 00:08:24,462
or ink cartridges for printers.

177
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,258
This may be convenient in some cases,
and not at all in other situations

178
00:08:29,423 --> 00:08:31,920
where logistic supply chains
are not efficient

179
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:35,720
or when public budgets do not plan
for recurring costs.

180
00:08:36,274 --> 00:08:39,443
The investment behavior
of households and individuals

181
00:08:39,641 --> 00:08:43,684
are, of course, conditioned
by a need to very closely manage

182
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:45,836
the little resources they have

183
00:08:46,017 --> 00:08:48,626
and maximize the impact
of these resources.

184
00:08:49,235 --> 00:08:51,600
As a consequence,
when budget is tight,

185
00:08:51,828 --> 00:08:54,979
solutions which allow re-use
instead of disposal

186
00:08:55,148 --> 00:08:56,537
are often much better.

187
00:08:57,590 --> 00:09:02,021
It is striking how much poor people
invest in communication technologies.

188
00:09:02,451 --> 00:09:07,325
Mobile services can indeed represent
up to 20% of a household's spending.

189
00:09:07,499 --> 00:09:10,519
However, there are many good reasons
to do that,

190
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,002
such as improved access
to market knowledge,

191
00:09:13,203 --> 00:09:14,995
or keeping crucial social links.

192
00:09:15,965 --> 00:09:19,149
Also, the poor generally
don't own credit cards,

193
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:22,125
nor have they access to
traditional banking services.

194
00:09:22,358 --> 00:09:24,696
Cell phones are increasingly
being used

195
00:09:24,882 --> 00:09:27,882
to transfer money
from one user to another.

196
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:32,366
The poor are also very vulnerable
to various financial shocks,

197
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,582
such as sudden illness of
the household's breadwinner,

198
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,086
or bad harvests due to climate.

199
00:09:38,372 --> 00:09:40,348
Hedging against those risks

200
00:09:40,522 --> 00:09:43,326
is a crucial component
of how these societies work.

201
00:09:44,035 --> 00:09:46,822
Lack of financial resources
at a household,

202
00:09:46,997 --> 00:09:48,234
community, or state level

203
00:09:48,423 --> 00:09:50,602
have numerous
and complex implications

204
00:09:50,795 --> 00:09:53,731
which may influence the adoption
of a new technology.

205
00:09:53,978 --> 00:09:56,532
It is necessary to spend time
and effort

206
00:09:56,705 --> 00:10:00,201
together with local stakeholders
to understand these implications.

207
00:10:01,247 --> 00:10:03,586
We have seen the 3 first challenges

208
00:10:03,774 --> 00:10:06,187
of the context of low
and middle income countries:

209
00:10:06,383 --> 00:10:09,673
a lack of quality infrastructure,
a lack of trained personnel,

210
00:10:10,033 --> 00:10:11,989
and a lack of financial resources.

211
00:10:12,427 --> 00:10:15,576
In the next video, we will discuss
the remaining ones:

212
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,614
harsh environment
and poor governance.

213
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:19,798
Goodbye.
