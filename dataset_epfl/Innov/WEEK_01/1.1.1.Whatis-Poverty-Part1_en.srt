00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:31,657
Hello. Welcome to this chapter
entitled what is poverty?

2
00:00:32,508 --> 00:00:35,383
Of course, this is a bit
of a provocative question,

3
00:00:35,613 --> 00:00:37,938
and we have to humbly admit
that there is no chance

4
00:00:38,143 --> 00:00:39,680
we could give a “good” answer

5
00:00:39,888 --> 00:00:42,488
 in the sense of inclusiveness
and generality.

6
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:45,747
There is an incredible wealth
of literature on this subject,

7
00:00:46,084 --> 00:00:49,084
so it is a great challenge
to give any kind of answer

8
00:00:49,307 --> 00:00:51,182
in one or two short videos.

9
00:00:51,971 --> 00:00:54,696
Nevertheless, we will try to
give you some basic knowledge

10
00:00:54,919 --> 00:00:57,006
 on poverty and how it is measured.

11
00:00:57,541 --> 00:01:00,728
First let’s emphasize one
of the very few facts 

12
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,400
on which there is a general
agreement:

13
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:07,710
Poverty is a very complex and
multi-dimensional problem.

14
00:01:07,949 --> 00:01:10,987
It goes well beyond just material
or monetary aspects. 

15
00:01:11,314 --> 00:01:15,152
Let us look at a few so called
determinants of poverty,

16
00:01:15,539 --> 00:01:18,039
meaning conditions that
cause poverty,

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,313
or at least are related to poverty.

18
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:23,684
Let’s look at these determinants
from three angles:

19
00:01:24,613 --> 00:01:27,225
1) at the macro or regional level,

20
00:01:27,435 --> 00:01:29,348
2) at the community level

21
00:01:29,708 --> 00:01:32,258
and 3) at the level of
the households. 

22
00:01:33,150 --> 00:01:36,050
At the Macro level,
determinants of poverty

23
00:01:36,298 --> 00:01:38,436
are of course very country specific.

24
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:42,435
Commonly cited determinants
are Geographic isolation,

25
00:01:42,773 --> 00:01:45,685
which refers for example to
island states or countries

26
00:01:45,926 --> 00:01:48,926
which are landlocked with no access
to sea trading routes.

27
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,114
Having no access to natural
resources can be a factor of poverty,

28
00:01:53,332 --> 00:01:55,294
but the opposite can be
true as well.

29
00:01:55,674 --> 00:01:58,312
Think of the so called
‘resources curse’,

30
00:01:58,533 --> 00:02:01,808
which burdens certain countries
where there is a lot of oil,

31
00:02:02,041 --> 00:02:04,479
but where citizens
are desperately poor.

32
00:02:05,017 --> 00:02:09,417
An inhospitable climate can put
an extra burden on countries:

33
00:02:09,982 --> 00:02:13,482
for example in the Sahel region
where droughts are frequent. 

34
00:02:13,746 --> 00:02:16,983
Bad governance is an obvious
contributor to poverty,

35
00:02:17,259 --> 00:02:20,447
for example when corruption
or administrative overloads

36
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:25,256
are impacting on the ease of creating
companies or doing business.

37
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:29,697
Conditions of Economic, Political
and Market instability,

38
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:33,258
will, for example, act as a deterrent
to foreign investment,

39
00:02:33,745 --> 00:02:35,533
which is important for development.

40
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:40,109
Regional insecurity and wars,
of course, have a direct impact

41
00:02:40,385 --> 00:02:42,435
on countries’ ability to prosper.

42
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:47,071
Freedom of intellectual expression
is crucial for a sound society

43
00:02:47,381 --> 00:02:50,144
in which problems get
openly discussed and solved.

44
00:02:50,913 --> 00:02:55,350
An ineffective and unfair judiciary
system will create inequality

45
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:57,870
and promote instability
and corruption.

46
00:02:58,483 --> 00:03:02,533
Finally, Gender, racial, ethnic
or social discriminations

47
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:05,682
will tend to impoverish
some sections of the population

48
00:03:05,877 --> 00:03:07,589
and the country altogether,

49
00:03:07,824 --> 00:03:10,262
 by denying the potentially
fruitful contribution

50
00:03:10,501 --> 00:03:14,551
that all humans can and should
bring to society as a whole.

51
00:03:15,472 --> 00:03:17,847
They are sources
of civil conflicts and wars.

52
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,095
Now let’s look at the determinants of
poverty at the community level.

53
00:03:22,484 --> 00:03:25,371
At that level, lack of access
to adequate infrastructure

54
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:27,855
 is a definite contributor
to poverty:

55
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:31,755
Think for example how a community
could possibly prosper

56
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,120
without access to paved roads,
stable electricity,

57
00:03:35,313 --> 00:03:38,663
access to schools, access to
markets where to sell goods,

58
00:03:38,997 --> 00:03:41,397
or access to clinics
where to get healthcare.

59
00:03:42,379 --> 00:03:46,929
Unequal access to employment will also
burden some of the poor communities,

60
00:03:47,249 --> 00:03:50,962
who will remain in a vicious cycle
where they are stigmatized,

61
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,051
and are thus not getting access
to decent jobs.

62
00:03:55,048 --> 00:03:59,198
In the same vein, social mobility
is of course also very important:

63
00:03:59,681 --> 00:04:02,318
being able to climb up
the ladders of society,

64
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:05,080
without hitting glass ceilings
is essential.

65
00:04:05,986 --> 00:04:09,248
At community level,
equitable distribution of land

66
00:04:09,475 --> 00:04:13,213
is a vitally important factor
as it allows local production

67
00:04:13,456 --> 00:04:16,343
and reduces vulnerability
in the community.

68
00:04:17,747 --> 00:04:20,747
Finally, what happens to
the poorest in the community?

69
00:04:21,022 --> 00:04:22,885
Do they have access to
social networks

70
00:04:23,112 --> 00:04:25,300
and institutions to help them?

71
00:04:25,829 --> 00:04:28,092
The community as a whole
will fare better

72
00:04:28,292 --> 00:04:31,292
if its poorer communities
are taken care of.

73
00:04:32,108 --> 00:04:33,621
At the household level,

74
00:04:33,831 --> 00:04:36,481
there are numerous determinants
of poverty as well,

75
00:04:36,722 --> 00:04:39,822
which we can group
into 3 main categories:

76
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:43,341
Demographic,  Economic
and Social.

77
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:47,898
In the demographic category we find
determinants such as:

78
00:04:48,216 --> 00:04:52,903
Large household sizes with members
having a younger average age.

79
00:04:53,562 --> 00:04:58,399
Obviously, such households generally
also have a higher dependency ratio,

80
00:04:58,614 --> 00:05:00,889
which means that a higher number
of family members

81
00:05:01,107 --> 00:05:03,957
depend on a few breadwinners
earning an income.

82
00:05:04,928 --> 00:05:07,653
The second category
is related to Economics:

83
00:05:08,028 --> 00:05:11,478
It is very obvious that the scarcity of sources of 
income is a problem,

84
00:05:11,715 --> 00:05:14,228
for example, in the case of
widespread unemployment,

85
00:05:14,438 --> 00:05:16,888
but also when the household
has no possibility

86
00:05:17,123 --> 00:05:18,423
to produce its own food.

87
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:22,110
Lack of property such as
a house, land,

88
00:05:22,313 --> 00:05:24,776
agricultural equipment,
or livestock,

89
00:05:25,009 --> 00:05:27,372
is another obvious determinant,
which also includes

90
00:05:27,578 --> 00:05:30,428
access to financial assets
and credit.

91
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:33,974
In the last category we find
Social aspects:

92
00:05:34,519 --> 00:05:36,619
Ill health is associated
with poverty

93
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:39,592
and there are many
manifestations of this link.

94
00:05:40,227 --> 00:05:43,690
Since in many poor countries
there are no health insurances,

95
00:05:43,925 --> 00:05:46,825
 individuals are very vulnerable
to falling into poverty,

96
00:05:47,037 --> 00:05:50,575
as a direct consequence
of a health problem.

97
00:05:50,799 --> 00:05:53,587
Having access to education
is absolutely crucial

98
00:05:53,845 --> 00:05:57,133
 to be able to take advantage of
income-earning opportunities,

99
00:05:57,665 --> 00:05:59,178
but is not sufficient.

100
00:05:59,574 --> 00:06:03,337
There can be access to education,
but the service is not used

101
00:06:03,548 --> 00:06:04,985
for a variety of reasons.

102
00:06:05,516 --> 00:06:07,954
Having shelter is
a basic human need.

103
00:06:08,225 --> 00:06:11,225
So its absence is an obvious
determinant of poverty.

104
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:13,606
But shelter alone is not enough:

105
00:06:13,942 --> 00:06:17,280
key services such as
safe water and sanitation,

106
00:06:17,512 --> 00:06:21,099
stable electricity or other safe
energy sources for cooking,

107
00:06:21,344 --> 00:06:25,257
lighting or operating communication
technology are needed too.

108
00:06:25,997 --> 00:06:28,685
For a household
living in isolation,

109
00:06:28,944 --> 00:06:31,831
without access to roads
and public transportation,

110
00:06:32,226 --> 00:06:33,701
is a determinant of poverty.

111
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:36,519
It will prevent individuals
from accessing markets

112
00:06:36,739 --> 00:06:39,214
where to sell their goods,
or to find jobs.

113
00:06:39,731 --> 00:06:42,706
Last but not least,
lack of personal safety

114
00:06:43,095 --> 00:06:45,507
is a terrible burden for
many people who are thus

115
00:06:45,746 --> 00:06:48,446
prevented from living
productive and joyful lives.

116
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,864
As said before, this list
is by no means complete,

117
00:06:53,114 --> 00:06:56,489
but it gives you a sense of the
multiple dimensions of poverty.

118
00:06:58,003 --> 00:07:00,915
Later in this course,
we will discuss an initiative

119
00:07:01,132 --> 00:07:04,945
that strives to define a framework
for a sustainable development

120
00:07:05,172 --> 00:07:06,572
in many of these areas:

121
00:07:06,821 --> 00:07:09,559
The United Nations
Sustainable Development Goals.

122
00:07:09,927 --> 00:07:14,977
Remember also that correlation
does not necessarily mean causation

123
00:07:15,472 --> 00:07:17,509
and that the real causes
are often hidden:

124
00:07:18,172 --> 00:07:22,422
Things are almost always much
more complex than they appear.

125
00:07:22,877 --> 00:07:26,702
Now let us try to find a workable
general definition of poverty.

126
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:29,811
For this, let us refer to
an organization

127
00:07:30,295 --> 00:07:33,545
whose very mission it is
to reduce poverty:

128
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:34,900
The World Bank.

129
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,895
This institution defines
poverty as, quote,

130
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:41,237
“pronounced deprivation in
wellbeing” unquote.

131
00:07:41,626 --> 00:07:43,851
This does not sound
very useful does it?

132
00:07:44,218 --> 00:07:47,381
Luckily for us, the world bank
has given some precise insights

133
00:07:47,616 --> 00:07:51,478
in their documentation, which
goes on to define wellbeing as:

134
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:53,249
A state which, 

135
00:07:53,487 --> 00:07:57,337
“can be measured by an individual’s
possession of income, health,

136
00:07:57,557 --> 00:08:00,619
nutrition, education,
assets, housing,

137
00:08:00,962 --> 00:08:04,724
and certain rights in a society,
such as freedom of speech.

138
00:08:04,998 --> 00:08:07,073
Poverty is also
a lack of opportunities,

139
00:08:07,327 --> 00:08:09,802
powerlessness, and vulnerability.

140
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:11,497
And the world bank concludes that:

141
00:08:11,744 --> 00:08:14,956
Poverty is truly a multi-dimensional
phenomenon.”

142
00:08:15,186 --> 00:08:17,949
Now having said that poverty
is multidimensional,

143
00:08:18,514 --> 00:08:22,289
are there ways to assess
poverty quantitatively?

144
00:08:22,588 --> 00:08:25,375
How many people are poor,
how poor are they?

145
00:08:25,604 --> 00:08:27,004
Where are they located?

146
00:08:27,231 --> 00:08:29,906
This, of course, is useful
in order to understand

147
00:08:30,129 --> 00:08:33,779
where to focus our attention
if we want to reduce poverty.

148
00:08:34,384 --> 00:08:38,271
Although there is no single figure
or index or number

149
00:08:38,508 --> 00:08:41,520
which can accurately describe
the state of wellbeing

150
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:43,489
of a given population or country,

151
00:08:43,806 --> 00:08:46,656
there are indicators which
can be helpful.

152
00:08:47,484 --> 00:08:51,121
There are, broadly speaking, 3
classes of such indicators: 

153
00:08:51,455 --> 00:08:53,068
These that are monetary,

154
00:08:53,321 --> 00:08:55,146
that is  they are expressed
in terms of income

155
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,065
or consumption as we will see,

156
00:08:57,696 --> 00:09:00,734
as well as those that are non-monetary,
for example

157
00:09:01,002 --> 00:09:03,552
life expectancy at birth,
as we will see,

158
00:09:03,799 --> 00:09:05,249
or Infant mortality rate

159
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:08,117
and those which are composite,

160
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:12,515
meaning that they combine both
monetary and non-monetary metrics.

161
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:15,928
Let us start with some
monetary indicators,

162
00:09:16,212 --> 00:09:19,212
which are widely used
as a catch-all figures

163
00:09:19,467 --> 00:09:22,155
to assess state of wellbeing
or poverty.

164
00:09:22,745 --> 00:09:25,470
The world bank’s definition
of poverty starts with

165
00:09:25,694 --> 00:09:28,582
“Poverty is pronounced deprivation
in wellbeing, where wellbeing

166
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,007
can be measured by an individual’s
possession of income etc.”

167
00:09:32,436 --> 00:09:34,524
Can we measure a
household’s income?

168
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,611
If we can do that, we may then
be able to define

169
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:41,515
a threshold under which a
household is considered poor:

170
00:09:42,007 --> 00:09:44,495
that is the so called
poverty line.

171
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:45,954
We will come back to this.

172
00:09:46,661 --> 00:09:50,248
It is possible to measure
household incomes using surveys

173
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,170
based on interviews conducted
with a sample

174
00:09:53,415 --> 00:09:55,365
of households in the countries.

175
00:09:55,867 --> 00:09:58,205
Unfortunately however
in many cases,

176
00:09:58,429 --> 00:10:01,129
estimating income is
not very convenient

177
00:10:01,355 --> 00:10:05,543
because households tend to
under-report their income.

178
00:10:06,062 --> 00:10:10,524
Also, some aspects of household-income
are difficult to quantify

179
00:10:10,738 --> 00:10:13,576
such as an increase in
farm livestock.

180
00:10:14,481 --> 00:10:18,644
In general, thus economists prefer
to use household consumption

181
00:10:18,888 --> 00:10:21,725
as a criterion except
in certain countries.

182
00:10:22,606 --> 00:10:25,731
Generally, either consumption
or income can be used

183
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,672
and this doesn’t really
matter much 

184
00:10:27,905 --> 00:10:29,968
if we look at things
in a general way.

185
00:10:30,757 --> 00:10:34,145
Consumption surveys cover
all monetary expenditures

186
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,383
for goods and services,
plus the monetary value

187
00:10:37,623 --> 00:10:40,473
 of all in-kind consumption,
such as food

188
00:10:40,716 --> 00:10:42,578
produced on the family farm.

189
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:45,671
Countries routinely conduct
such surveys,

190
00:10:45,913 --> 00:10:48,638
which are then aggregated
by the world bank.

191
00:10:49,869 --> 00:10:52,506
Generally economists transform
the Household consumption

192
00:10:52,742 --> 00:10:55,942
into a consumption
per person or per capita.

193
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,953
That means the total
household consumption,

194
00:11:00,172 --> 00:11:03,935
is divided by the number of
individuals living in that household.

195
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:08,148
This gives a figure of how many
units of local currency

196
00:11:08,719 --> 00:11:11,994
are expensed per person
and per day for living.

197
00:11:12,998 --> 00:11:17,248
Let's imagine a hypothetical country
which we will call country C.

198
00:11:18,016 --> 00:11:20,379
We conduct a survey of
household consumption,

199
00:11:20,617 --> 00:11:22,579
and we get a distribution
of income.

200
00:11:22,792 --> 00:11:26,329
We divide this income by the
number of people in the household

201
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:29,391
and we get the income
distribution per capita,

202
00:11:29,615 --> 00:11:31,578
in the local country’s currency.

203
00:11:32,035 --> 00:11:34,898
We now draft income as a function
of the share of the population

204
00:11:35,107 --> 00:11:38,070
that lives on a specific
income base.

205
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,470
This is a probability
density function.

206
00:11:40,931 --> 00:11:43,981
Here for example, we have
10% of the population 

207
00:11:44,196 --> 00:11:47,133
who lives on say 5 items
of local currency per day.

208
00:11:47,777 --> 00:11:48,802
Are they poor or not?

209
00:11:49,369 --> 00:11:50,556
To answer this question,

210
00:11:50,782 --> 00:11:53,007
the local country authorities
will determine

211
00:11:53,225 --> 00:11:54,637
a minimum level of income

212
00:11:54,872 --> 00:11:57,134
under which an individual is
to be considered poor

213
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,423
by local standards.

214
00:11:58,731 --> 00:12:01,456
This is the National poverty
line and remember,

215
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,412
it is in local currency.

216
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:07,964
This poverty line is very different
from one country to another.

217
00:12:08,211 --> 00:12:11,899
If we want to know what
is the total share of people

218
00:12:12,126 --> 00:12:14,814
in the country living below
the poverty line,

219
00:12:15,049 --> 00:12:16,911
we have to sum up
or integrate

220
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:21,323
all the contributions below
the curve, up to that point.

221
00:12:22,636 --> 00:12:25,286
Now let us assume we would
like to compare the situation

222
00:12:25,551 --> 00:12:28,864
of wealth of that particular country
with other countries: 

223
00:12:29,142 --> 00:12:31,592
we now have the problem of the
difference in currencies

224
00:12:32,022 --> 00:12:35,109
or exchange rates, but that
is not the only problem.

225
00:12:35,599 --> 00:12:39,212
In fact we all know that prices vary
enormously across countries

226
00:12:39,454 --> 00:12:44,291
even when converted to a reference
currency such as the US Dollar:

227
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,616
The purchasing power is different.

228
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:50,066
Think for example of the cost
of buying a lunch in a restaurant

229
00:12:50,334 --> 00:12:52,009
or paying an apartment rent.

230
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:55,400
There are big differences
between countries.

231
00:12:56,377 --> 00:13:00,027
To solve this issue, it is necessary
to convert all local currencies

232
00:13:00,255 --> 00:13:04,118
into a reference currency which
is called the international dollar,

233
00:13:04,322 --> 00:13:07,259
and to factor-out the difference
in buying power.

234
00:13:07,789 --> 00:13:09,589
This can be done by referring to

235
00:13:09,817 --> 00:13:12,342
a standardized basket
of goods and services.

236
00:13:12,767 --> 00:13:15,817
We then determine how much
this basket used to cost

237
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:19,886
in the United States in a
specific reference year,

238
00:13:20,163 --> 00:13:22,213
for example in 2011.

239
00:13:22,946 --> 00:13:26,196
After that we can determine the cost
of the same basket

240
00:13:26,498 --> 00:13:30,623
of goods and services, in
our country C’s local currency.

241
00:13:31,913 --> 00:13:34,213
The ratio of the cost
in the United States

242
00:13:34,424 --> 00:13:36,824
to the cost in the country’s
local currency

243
00:13:37,052 --> 00:13:41,714
is called the Purchasing Power
Parity or PPP Conversion factor.

244
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:46,017
It represents how many items in
local currency would be needed,

245
00:13:46,228 --> 00:13:49,141
to have the same buying power
as the Dollar had

246
00:13:49,444 --> 00:13:51,982
in the United States at
a certain point in time.

247
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:56,502
One PPP dollar should thus buy
the same basket of goods

248
00:13:56,749 --> 00:13:58,887
 in Kenya, India or the US.

249
00:13:59,417 --> 00:14:02,117
We can now express consumption
in any country

250
00:14:02,427 --> 00:14:05,427
in terms of international
dollars at PPP.

251
00:14:05,994 --> 00:14:09,919
Doing this with other countries
will allow us to compare them.

252
00:14:10,538 --> 00:14:14,238
Now we can re-calculate the income
or consumption distribution

253
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:19,096
per capita per day
in international dollars at PPP.

254
00:14:19,723 --> 00:14:23,548
We now have a curve that still
represents precisely the country C

255
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:27,578
that we are considering, but can be
compared to other countries, 

256
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:30,292
where of course the same
calculations were done. 

257
00:14:31,026 --> 00:14:33,401
Having done this, we
would now need to know

258
00:14:33,637 --> 00:14:35,187
what happens to the poverty line.

259
00:14:36,161 --> 00:14:40,649
In fact, what we are interested in,
is to know how this particular country

260
00:14:40,924 --> 00:14:43,574
compares in terms of poverty
with other countries.

261
00:14:44,954 --> 00:14:48,754
For this, the world bank has defined
an international poverty line

262
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:52,808
that tells us what it means to be
in extreme poverty

263
00:14:53,054 --> 00:14:55,954
in terms of international
dollars at PPP.

264
00:14:56,644 --> 00:14:59,594
This line is calculated by
taking the average value

265
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:03,646
of the national poverty lines of
some of the poorest countries.

266
00:15:04,035 --> 00:15:09,273
It is currently at 1.9 international
dollar per capita, per day at PPP.

267
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,243
This is a very crude threshold

268
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,930
which being based on the poverty
lines of the poorest countries,

269
00:15:15,187 --> 00:15:16,687
is an absolute minimum.

270
00:15:16,907 --> 00:15:20,770
We can now calculate the number
of people living on less than

271
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,810
 $1.9/capita/day in country C.

272
00:15:24,058 --> 00:15:27,895
This gives us the so called
poverty headcount ratio.

273
00:15:28,133 --> 00:15:30,720
It is simply the area under
the curve in our graph,

274
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:32,580
on the left of the poverty line.

275
00:15:32,982 --> 00:15:35,694
This allows us to determine
where on the planet

276
00:15:36,176 --> 00:15:40,301
most of today’s extreme poor
people live, let us have a look.

277
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,481
This map shows you the countries

278
00:15:42,702 --> 00:15:45,177
with their respective poverty
headcount ratio.

279
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:48,541
Globally this represents
about 900 million people

280
00:15:48,815 --> 00:15:51,365
living in the most extreme
form of poverty,

281
00:15:51,602 --> 00:15:54,202
struggling to meet
their most basic needs.

282
00:15:54,434 --> 00:15:57,659
Of course there is no such
a thing as a clean limit

283
00:15:57,895 --> 00:15:59,482
between poor and non-poor.

284
00:15:59,693 --> 00:16:02,343
If we were to consider a limit
of $3/capita/day,

285
00:16:02,572 --> 00:16:04,097
which is still very low,

286
00:16:04,337 --> 00:16:07,962
the amount of people concerned goes up
to a staggering 2 billion worldwide.

287
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:12,746
In general, around 50% of all Africans
live below the poverty line.

288
00:16:12,961 --> 00:16:15,799
In many African countries
it is even more than that.

289
00:16:16,044 --> 00:16:18,932
This is a terrible situation
in this marvelous continent,

290
00:16:19,351 --> 00:16:21,888
and this is why our MOOC is
focused mainly on

291
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,960
the context of sub-Saharan Africa.

292
00:16:24,445 --> 00:16:26,932
For those of you who have read
about the subject of poverty,

293
00:16:27,185 --> 00:16:30,835
there is a concept that is sometimes
used called the Bottom of the Pyramid.

294
00:16:31,077 --> 00:16:33,627
The bottom of the pyramid
is generally defined as

295
00:16:33,869 --> 00:16:36,469
those people living on less
than 2 dollars a day 

296
00:16:36,693 --> 00:16:39,618
which is pretty much equal to
our international poverty line.

297
00:16:40,231 --> 00:16:42,919
In our next video,
we will continue the discussion

298
00:16:43,169 --> 00:16:46,744
on monetary metrics such as
Gross Domestic Product.

299
00:16:46,984 --> 00:16:49,697
We will then talk about
non-monetary metrics

300
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:52,394
and finally we will discuss
Composite metrics,

301
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:56,100
which combine both monetary
and non-monetary indices.

302
00:16:56,336 --> 00:16:57,361
Good bye.
