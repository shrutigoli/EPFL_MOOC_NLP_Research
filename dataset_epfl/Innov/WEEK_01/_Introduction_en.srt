1
00:00:12,934 --> 00:00:15,799
When we buy new devices

2
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:17,855
it's hard at first,
because the expensive

3
00:00:18,014 --> 00:00:19,726
public market procedures

4
00:00:19,983 --> 00:00:20,999
are laborious,

5
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:23,950
but when we eventually do it,
the device that is delivered

6
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:27,659
is often not adapted to our needs.

7
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:30,570
It cannot cope with two things 

8
00:00:30,855 --> 00:00:32,379
that are important here.

9
00:00:32,936 --> 00:00:36,149
The instability of the power supply

10
00:00:36,507 --> 00:00:38,804
is a major cause.

11
00:00:39,421 --> 00:00:41,585
Power shuts off abruptly

12
00:00:41,847 --> 00:00:43,520
while the device is functioning.

13
00:00:44,047 --> 00:00:46,594
And when it comes back there is voltage surge,
which burns

14
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,853
the devices because
they are not

15
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,608
protected from that and we do not have
AC electric supply

16
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:54,180
that is stable.

17
00:00:54,778 --> 00:00:55,950
So these new devices

18
00:00:56,507 --> 00:00:58,383
are not really adapted for here.

19
00:00:58,624 --> 00:01:01,358
They are maybe too delicate for us.

20
00:01:02,683 --> 00:01:05,334
And when the breakdown occurs

21
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:08,069
We often do not have the means

22
00:01:08,364 --> 00:01:11,058
to repair it, because we have 

23
00:01:11,534 --> 00:01:12,727
difficulties getting spare parts.

24
00:01:13,509 --> 00:01:15,077
There could be one technician 

25
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:16,476
in Yaoundé, but

26
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:19,799
he doesn't have time,
so repairing

27
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:22,190
is difficult.

28
00:01:23,184 --> 00:01:24,515
So the devices could be new 

29
00:01:25,026 --> 00:01:26,253
or old,

30
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,161
but all are fragiles,
and not really adapted

31
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:31,592
to these problems or 
even humidity problems.

32
00:01:32,709 --> 00:01:36,033
And they are difficult to repair
because there are no spare parts and no staff.

33
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:38,175
So, we've estimated the availability

34
00:01:38,462 --> 00:01:41,026
of devices to somewhere

35
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:43,673
from 5 to 15%

36
00:01:44,109 --> 00:01:45,190
in the whole country

37
00:01:45,689 --> 00:01:47,754
depending on the districts.

38
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:57,773
Hello, and welcome 
to this first video of our course

39
00:01:57,973 --> 00:02:01,632
entitled Technology Innovation 
for Sustainable Development.

40
00:02:02,232 --> 00:02:04,599
As you have heard
from the brief video,

41
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:09,112
there is a fundamental problem
with existing technologies.

42
00:02:09,312 --> 00:02:12,520
They are poorly adapted
to the context and the needs 

43
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:14,892
of countries such as Cameroon. 

44
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:15,993
Of course

45
00:02:16,193 --> 00:02:18,733
this is not restricted
to medical technologies

46
00:02:18,933 --> 00:02:22,486
as many others 
are crucial for development.

47
00:02:22,686 --> 00:02:24,352
But which are they?

48
00:02:24,552 --> 00:02:28,884
 How can we maximize the chances 
that new innovative technologies

49
00:02:29,084 --> 00:02:33,618
really deliver their full potential
and in a sustainable way

50
00:02:33,818 --> 00:02:36,104
 to the people who need them?

51
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:39,963
We look forward to developing
these topics and many more

52
00:02:40,163 --> 00:02:41,432
together with you,

53
00:02:41,632 --> 00:02:44,429
but first let us introduce ourselves

54
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:48,102
as we will be your guides
through this journey. 

55
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,137
Hello.

56
00:02:49,337 --> 00:02:52,017
My name is Solomzi
or Soli Makohliso.

57
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:54,449
I am Biomedical Engineer 
by training,

58
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:55,855
but I have been involved

59
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:58,246
with entrepreneurship 
and start-up companies

60
00:02:58,446 --> 00:02:59,694
for almost 2 decades now,

61
00:02:59,894 --> 00:03:03,232
 in Africa, the US, and Europe.

62
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:07,390
My area of personal interest now 
is technology-based innovation

63
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,020
and entrepreneurship 

64
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,056
for purposes of having a profound 
and sustainable impact,

65
00:03:12,256 --> 00:03:14,672
especially in sub-Saharan Africa.

66
00:03:15,447 --> 00:03:18,085
It’s a great challenge,
but yet an exciting prospect

67
00:03:18,285 --> 00:03:20,145
for us to put together this course.

68
00:03:20,345 --> 00:03:21,933
Because I am a true believer

69
00:03:22,046 --> 00:03:24,175
in the power
of technological innovation

70
00:03:24,275 --> 00:03:27,081
being able to leap-frog
developing countries

71
00:03:27,281 --> 00:03:29,846
out of poverty in certain areas.

72
00:03:30,046 --> 00:03:31,706
 Therefore by making this course,

73
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:34,459
it is our wish that 
it can help make a contribution

74
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:38,696
towards harnessing this power 
of technological innovation,

75
00:03:38,896 --> 00:03:40,449
even for those languishing

76
00:03:40,649 --> 00:03:44,212
at the bottom of the pyramid
in society today. 

77
00:03:44,412 --> 00:03:47,854
I am Klaus Schönenberger and I have 
an engineering background.

78
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:51,046
I have spent over 10 years
in the private sector,

79
00:03:51,246 --> 00:03:52,816
in research and development,

80
00:03:53,016 --> 00:03:54,960
operations and business development.

81
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:59,032
I spent most of that time
in the field of medical devices.

82
00:03:59,232 --> 00:04:01,360
After a certain while in my career,

83
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,604
I noticed something
that really shocked me:

84
00:04:03,804 --> 00:04:07,276
Less than 10%
of the world’s population

85
00:04:07,476 --> 00:04:11,617
consumes over ⅔ of all
medical devices produced.

86
00:04:11,817 --> 00:04:13,012
I was appalled.

87
00:04:13,212 --> 00:04:16,480
How could it be that such
an overwhelming majority

88
00:04:16,667 --> 00:04:19,151
of the world’s population
had so little access

89
00:04:19,351 --> 00:04:21,682
to essential medical devices?

90
00:04:21,882 --> 00:04:25,899
This got me to engage
on a fascinating exploration

91
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,112
which took me back to academia

92
00:04:28,312 --> 00:04:30,836
as I am convinced that
we have to deeply change

93
00:04:31,036 --> 00:04:34,081
the way we develop
technological solutions

94
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:37,000
to meet the needs
and aspirations of the poorest. 

95
00:04:37,665 --> 00:04:38,893
I discovered also

96
00:04:39,093 --> 00:04:42,529
that there were many other
essential technologies

97
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:45,703
which were sorely needed
in developing countries,

98
00:04:45,903 --> 00:04:48,670
but which remained
desperately inaccessible

99
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:51,033
to those who need them most.

100
00:04:51,951 --> 00:04:55,380
I am glad that you have
decided to join this course.

101
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:58,183
If you have registered
for this course today

102
00:04:58,383 --> 00:05:01,536
we assume that you are interested
in how technology innovation

103
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:04,144
can foster sustainable development.

104
00:05:04,344 --> 00:05:08,006
You are curious about
how technology can be an enabler 

105
00:05:08,206 --> 00:05:10,708
for the poor to improve their lives.

106
00:05:10,908 --> 00:05:13,640
We assume that you want
to learn how to proceed

107
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,175
towards developing 
and deploying sustainable

108
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:18,428
and impactful solutions

109
00:05:18,628 --> 00:05:21,203
based on technology innovation.

110
00:05:21,698 --> 00:05:23,999
Perhaps you have a project
idea of your own?

111
00:05:24,795 --> 00:05:29,079
An idea of a new technology that
could have an impact on poverty?

112
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:30,463
Or perhaps,

113
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,006
you are simply intrigued

114
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,288
by the role that 
technology innovation

115
00:05:34,488 --> 00:05:37,703
could or should play in development.

116
00:05:37,903 --> 00:05:40,264
Whether you are from
an industrialized country

117
00:05:40,464 --> 00:05:42,246
or from a developing country,

118
00:05:42,446 --> 00:05:45,303
whether you are an engineer,
or a scientist. 

119
00:05:45,403 --> 00:05:47,871
Whether you are employed
in an existing company

120
00:05:47,984 --> 00:05:51,966
an NGO,
an international organization

121
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,451
or a state department.

122
00:05:53,651 --> 00:05:56,392
Whether you are 
an independent entrepreneur,

123
00:05:56,592 --> 00:05:58,879
or simply a passionate individual,

124
00:05:59,079 --> 00:06:00,863
this course is for you.

125
00:06:01,425 --> 00:06:02,872
In this course

126
00:06:03,072 --> 00:06:06,251
you will learn how 
to develop innovative technologies

127
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:08,641
that contribute
to sustainable development

128
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:10,954
in countries in the Global South.

129
00:06:11,154 --> 00:06:13,969
For that you will need
to understand,

130
00:06:14,169 --> 00:06:15,768
and be able to integrate

131
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:19,589
the influence of the context
that prevails in these countries. 

132
00:06:19,874 --> 00:06:23,584
We will give you a set
of powerful strategic tools,

133
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,557
that will make you a leader

134
00:06:25,757 --> 00:06:28,539
capable of steering
your project towards success.

135
00:06:29,525 --> 00:06:32,918
This involves understanding 
what are the crucial steps

136
00:06:33,118 --> 00:06:34,182
in the process,

137
00:06:34,382 --> 00:06:36,591
the risks and opportunities.

138
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,318
We will teach you

139
00:06:38,518 --> 00:06:42,925
how to minimize these risks
and capitalize on the opportunities.

140
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:44,780
What we are aiming for

141
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:47,723
is not the development
of a one-off solution

142
00:06:47,923 --> 00:06:51,599
for, say a village
in Africa or South-East Asia.

143
00:06:51,799 --> 00:06:54,771
This is not just about making
one prototype

144
00:06:54,971 --> 00:06:56,573
and considering the job done.

145
00:06:56,773 --> 00:06:58,160
We want to teach you

146
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,047
how to come-up with solutions

147
00:07:00,247 --> 00:07:04,380
that can be widely and sustainably
deployed and scaled-up,

148
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:06,719
 so that impact is maximized.

149
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:09,039
As we will see in detail,

150
00:07:09,239 --> 00:07:11,683
our strategy relies
on entrepreneurship.

151
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:13,151
We believe that

152
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:15,666
the most efficient
and sustainable way

153
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:20,737
to deploy a technology innovation
is to find a robust business model,

154
00:07:20,937 --> 00:07:24,896
which will make sure the technology
is made widely available

155
00:07:25,096 --> 00:07:27,620
and also supported in the long run. 

156
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:31,871
Now let us have a look
at the structure of this course. 

157
00:07:32,071 --> 00:07:34,300
The course entails 6 chapters.

158
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,994
In the first chapter,

159
00:07:36,194 --> 00:07:39,982
we will provide you with the basics
on poverty and its alleviation.

160
00:07:40,182 --> 00:07:42,403
You will learn
how poverty is defined,

161
00:07:42,603 --> 00:07:46,882
how it is globally distributed,
and about its determinants.

162
00:07:47,082 --> 00:07:49,586
You will also hear
about the major initiatives

163
00:07:49,786 --> 00:07:52,716
launched by the United Nations
to fight poverty,

164
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:55,782
such as the Millennium
Development Goals before

165
00:07:55,982 --> 00:07:59,676
and the Sustainable
Development Goals currently. 

166
00:07:59,876 --> 00:08:01,992
In this chapter we will also discuss

167
00:08:02,192 --> 00:08:05,663
which technologies could be deemed
essential for development.

168
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:08,466
And we will tell you
about the challenge

169
00:08:08,666 --> 00:08:10,724
and the particularity of the context

170
00:08:10,924 --> 00:08:14,320
found in many or most
developing countries,

171
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:18,198
and how this context
influences technology innovation. 

172
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:23,879
In the second chapter you will hear 
about the 8 Essential Technologies,

173
00:08:24,079 --> 00:08:26,594
where we will give you an overview

174
00:08:26,794 --> 00:08:28,770
of why they are essential

175
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:32,244
and also discuss
their global access.

176
00:08:32,444 --> 00:08:35,103
In chapter 3 we will
give you an overview

177
00:08:35,303 --> 00:08:39,725
of the process to develop
and deploy technology innovation

178
00:08:39,925 --> 00:08:43,716
adapted to the context
of those countries.

179
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:49,038
We will present the first
of 3 strategic tools to you,

180
00:08:49,238 --> 00:08:51,031
which is the Impact Canvas.

181
00:08:51,231 --> 00:08:53,703
Which is essentially
a tool that helps you define

182
00:08:53,903 --> 00:08:56,653
your desired
social impact or objective,

183
00:08:56,853 --> 00:09:00,009
and strategies
to construct and monitor steps

184
00:09:00,209 --> 00:09:03,880
towards that social
objective or impact.

185
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,888
We will also introduce a case study

186
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,941
that will help us better
illustrate the use of the tool.

187
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:12,690
And in chapter 4 you will learn

188
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:17,041
about what we call
the Product Value chain tool. 

189
00:09:17,891 --> 00:09:20,430
This is really
an important methodology or tool,

190
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:22,196
as it allows you to understand

191
00:09:22,396 --> 00:09:25,601
all the stages
of the product's lifecycle,

192
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:27,018
including the influence

193
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:28,761
of the different stakeholders

194
00:09:28,961 --> 00:09:31,628
and the context itself, of course.

195
00:09:31,828 --> 00:09:34,096
In Chapter 5 we will introduce

196
00:09:34,296 --> 00:09:39,155
what is termed the 
Business Model Canvas tool,

197
00:09:39,355 --> 00:09:43,623
which is a great and relatively
simple-to-use methodology

198
00:09:43,823 --> 00:09:46,721
to generate solid and sustainable
business models.

199
00:09:46,921 --> 00:09:51,070
However, we have adapted
this tool in this course

200
00:09:51,232 --> 00:09:54,765
to also suit the specific objective
of technology innovation 

201
00:09:54,965 --> 00:09:56,895
for sustainable development. 

202
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:58,628
And finally in chapter 6

203
00:09:58,828 --> 00:10:02,124
we will discuss all the 3 steps

204
00:10:02,324 --> 00:10:05,003
of the technology innovation
process in more detail,

205
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:09,565
as well as how and when 
the 3 strategic tools

206
00:10:09,765 --> 00:10:11,809
discussed before are used 

207
00:10:12,009 --> 00:10:16,390
to maximize impact
and minimize risk of failure.

208
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:19,137
We look forward 
to your participation

209
00:10:19,225 --> 00:10:20,333
in the course.

210
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:22,773
We think that
we all have a role to play

211
00:10:22,848 --> 00:10:25,431
in trying to improve the lives 
of the poorest people

212
00:10:25,506 --> 00:10:26,937
on this planet.

213
00:10:27,137 --> 00:10:30,665
This MOOC is a unique
opportunity also for us,

214
00:10:30,865 --> 00:10:33,545
as we have a chance
to learn from the experience

215
00:10:33,657 --> 00:10:35,779
of hopefully thousands of people 

216
00:10:35,917 --> 00:10:37,529
who are working in this field.

217
00:10:37,729 --> 00:10:40,282
We really hope to get your feedback

218
00:10:40,482 --> 00:10:42,763
so that we can share
the best practices

219
00:10:42,963 --> 00:10:46,933
and have a wide-scale impact
on this unacceptable divide

220
00:10:47,133 --> 00:10:48,972
between the rich and poor,

221
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:51,735
between industrialized
and developing countries.

222
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:54,622
We wish to repeatedly emphasize

223
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:56,897
that developing
technology innovation 

224
00:10:56,997 --> 00:10:58,479
for sustainable development

225
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:01,569
is not something
that can be done alone.

226
00:11:01,769 --> 00:11:04,859
Such projects require
a major effort 

227
00:11:05,059 --> 00:11:08,719
to reach out and collaborate
with people from various disciplines

228
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,346
and in various countries.

229
00:11:10,546 --> 00:11:12,823
What is needed, to start with,

230
00:11:13,023 --> 00:11:15,929
is a good dose 
of entrepreneurial spirit,

231
00:11:16,129 --> 00:11:17,940
grit and determination,

232
00:11:18,140 --> 00:11:21,350
but also a spirit of openness
and flexibility.

233
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:24,089
For the rest,
it is the purpose of this course

234
00:11:24,289 --> 00:11:27,066
to give you the necessary
knowledge and tools.

235
00:11:27,266 --> 00:11:29,084
Now let’s get started!
