00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,477
Hello, welcome to the second part

2
00:00:28,575 --> 00:00:29,901
of the chapter entitled

3
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:30,993
What is poverty?

4
00:00:31,159 --> 00:00:32,108
In the first video,

5
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:33,530
we have seen that poverty

6
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:34,949
is a multi-dimensional problem.

7
00:00:35,114 --> 00:00:36,251
We have also seen

8
00:00:36,337 --> 00:00:37,638
the definition of poverty 

9
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:38,711
by the world-bank,

10
00:00:38,844 --> 00:00:39,745
which we have used 

11
00:00:39,923 --> 00:00:41,811
as a base to try and understand 

12
00:00:41,987 --> 00:00:43,637
how we can measure poverty.

13
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:45,577
To do this, we have defined

14
00:00:45,742 --> 00:00:47,317
three types of metrics:

15
00:00:47,476 --> 00:00:49,825
those based on monetary values,

16
00:00:50,007 --> 00:00:52,308
those based on non-monetary metrics

17
00:00:52,475 --> 00:00:54,888
and those which are composite,

18
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:57,218
combining the two. 

19
00:00:57,381 --> 00:00:58,744
We have started looking at

20
00:00:58,913 --> 00:01:00,763
monetary metrics and have seen

21
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:02,617
the concept of the poverty line,

22
00:01:02,784 --> 00:01:05,659
defined as 1.9 international dollar,

23
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:06,969
per capita, per day,

24
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:10,143
at Purchasing Power Parity or PPP.

25
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:12,220
There is another monetary metric

26
00:01:12,374 --> 00:01:13,386
which we need to mention

27
00:01:13,512 --> 00:01:15,262
because it is very widely used:

28
00:01:15,434 --> 00:01:16,810
the Gross Domestic Product

29
00:01:16,913 --> 00:01:17,763
per capita.

30
00:01:17,924 --> 00:01:19,249
The idea is to measure

31
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:20,479
the market value

32
00:01:20,605 --> 00:01:22,830
of the total production or output

33
00:01:22,997 --> 00:01:25,611
within a country in a given year.

34
00:01:25,846 --> 00:01:27,571
Without going into details,

35
00:01:27,739 --> 00:01:30,526
GDP is defined roughly as the sum of

36
00:01:30,687 --> 00:01:33,526
private household consumption (C),

37
00:01:33,679 --> 00:01:34,866
such as durable

38
00:01:34,959 --> 00:01:36,810
and non-durable goods and services,.

39
00:01:37,238 --> 00:01:38,938
Plus Investments (I)

40
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,942
made by public or private sectors

41
00:01:41,109 --> 00:01:42,184
on capital equipment, 

42
00:01:42,353 --> 00:01:44,504
inventories and structures,

43
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,844
Plus Government  spending (G),

44
00:01:47,012 --> 00:01:48,223
such as compensation

45
00:01:48,309 --> 00:01:49,935
of government employees,

46
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:51,852
public health spending, etc.

47
00:01:52,024 --> 00:01:54,486
Plus the net exports of the country,

48
00:01:54,593 --> 00:01:55,481
which is the value

49
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,111
of all exports (X)

50
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:58,051
minus the value

51
00:01:58,158 --> 00:01:59,871
of imported goods (M).

52
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:00,755
In other words,

53
00:02:00,821 --> 00:02:02,071
it represents the value

54
00:02:02,151 --> 00:02:03,189
of domestic goods

55
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:04,717
purchased by foreigners,

56
00:02:04,872 --> 00:02:06,698
minus the value of foreign goods

57
00:02:06,858 --> 00:02:08,733
purchased by nationals.

58
00:02:08,903 --> 00:02:10,603
Finally, of course, this figure 

59
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:12,700
is in units of national currency

60
00:02:12,863 --> 00:02:13,937
and must be converted 

61
00:02:14,049 --> 00:02:16,348
into international dollars at PPP

62
00:02:16,525 --> 00:02:17,724
as we have seen.

63
00:02:17,903 --> 00:02:18,777
Furthermore,

64
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:20,729
it is divided by the amount of people

65
00:02:20,892 --> 00:02:21,805
living in the country

66
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,360
to end-up with GDP,

67
00:02:23,513 --> 00:02:25,038
per capita, at PPP. 

68
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:27,147
This concept is based on the work

69
00:02:27,265 --> 00:02:28,390
of John Maynard Keynes

70
00:02:28,528 --> 00:02:29,828
in the 1940’s.

71
00:02:29,999 --> 00:02:30,886
At that time,

72
00:02:31,043 --> 00:02:32,718
there was a need to measure

73
00:02:32,865 --> 00:02:34,903
Great Britain’s ability to wage war,

74
00:02:35,064 --> 00:02:37,189
which in economic words meant:

75
00:02:37,355 --> 00:02:38,493
its ability to produce

76
00:02:38,647 --> 00:02:40,047
tanks and airplanes.

77
00:02:41,045 --> 00:02:43,008
It is really intended to be a measure

78
00:02:43,158 --> 00:02:44,558
of production or output, and

79
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,623
not welfare.

80
00:02:45,804 --> 00:02:46,329
However,

81
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:48,471
it is still widely used and abused

82
00:02:48,618 --> 00:02:49,943
as a metric for welfare.  

83
00:02:50,279 --> 00:02:52,229
To illustrate this discrepancy,

84
00:02:52,391 --> 00:02:54,553
take for example Equatorial Guinea:

85
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,916
it has a GDP which is rather high

86
00:02:57,088 --> 00:03:00,100
at $33’000/capita per year,

87
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,326
which would make it

88
00:03:01,492 --> 00:03:02,704
a high-income country.

89
00:03:02,857 --> 00:03:03,670
And yet close

90
00:03:03,843 --> 00:03:05,730
80% of the population lives

91
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,175
below the poverty line.

92
00:03:07,346 --> 00:03:08,709
How is that possible?

93
00:03:08,882 --> 00:03:11,545
In fact, Equatorial Guinea has oil,

94
00:03:11,719 --> 00:03:12,656
which it exports,

95
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:14,388
and this increases the X

96
00:03:14,542 --> 00:03:15,354
in our equation.

97
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:16,335
However,

98
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:18,823
the share of that GDP available

99
00:03:18,927 --> 00:03:20,140
for household consumption

100
00:03:20,321 --> 00:03:22,083
is only 17% of the whole,

101
00:03:22,262 --> 00:03:24,524
which is the C in our equation.

102
00:03:24,699 --> 00:03:26,711
This tells us that a majority

103
00:03:26,809 --> 00:03:29,234
of all households do not benefit

104
00:03:29,399 --> 00:03:30,573
from the oil-revenues

105
00:03:30,734 --> 00:03:32,671
which are kept by a minority.

106
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,462
We will come back to this question

107
00:03:34,563 --> 00:03:35,987
of income distribution.

108
00:03:36,190 --> 00:03:37,440
Based on the calculation

109
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:38,963
of GDP per capita,

110
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,395
or more precisely

111
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:42,383
on Gross National Income

112
00:03:42,543 --> 00:03:44,518
which is a variant of GDP,

113
00:03:44,644 --> 00:03:45,993
the world bank has a defined

114
00:03:46,141 --> 00:03:47,840
a classification of countries.

115
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,691
It defines Low-income

116
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,804
as those countries that have an income

117
00:03:52,972 --> 00:03:55,583
of 1'045 dollars per capita,

118
00:03:55,744 --> 00:03:57,132
per year, or less.

119
00:03:57,338 --> 00:03:58,714
Middle-Income countries

120
00:03:58,881 --> 00:04:00,893
are split into lower-middle

121
00:04:00,997 --> 00:04:02,209
and Upper-middle income,

122
00:04:02,331 --> 00:04:03,281
and finally we have

123
00:04:03,444 --> 00:04:04,907
high income countries.

124
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,280
Those are the ones

125
00:04:06,447 --> 00:04:07,896
with a Gross National Income

126
00:04:08,072 --> 00:04:11,535
above 12’736 dollars per capita

127
00:04:11,688 --> 00:04:13,500
at PPP per year.

128
00:04:13,724 --> 00:04:14,699
In our MOOC

129
00:04:14,867 --> 00:04:15,930
we will often refer

130
00:04:16,077 --> 00:04:17,890
to Low and Middle-Income countries

131
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:19,408
as the region of interest.

132
00:04:19,772 --> 00:04:21,421
As you can see on this map,

133
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:22,982
many of the poorest countries

134
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,717
are landlocked,

135
00:04:23,891 --> 00:04:25,604
such as the string of countries

136
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,217
running through the center

137
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,739
of the African continent,

138
00:04:28,856 --> 00:04:30,406
or Nepal for example.

139
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:31,859
Other countries,

140
00:04:32,032 --> 00:04:34,157
such as Afghanistan or Somalia

141
00:04:34,326 --> 00:04:35,164
remain poor,

142
00:04:35,339 --> 00:04:37,489
because they are afflicted by war.

143
00:04:37,663 --> 00:04:39,301
You might ask yourself

144
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:40,889
if it is enough to know

145
00:04:41,064 --> 00:04:42,251
how countries compare.

146
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,559
Remember the case of Equatorial Guinea:

147
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:46,122
wouldn’t it be interesting

148
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:48,458
to know also how wealth is distributed

149
00:04:48,623 --> 00:04:50,498
inside a specific country?

150
00:04:50,664 --> 00:04:53,027
To determine the level of inequality

151
00:04:53,124 --> 00:04:54,549
inside of a country,

152
00:04:54,712 --> 00:04:56,562
economists use another measure

153
00:04:56,721 --> 00:04:58,145
developed in 1912

154
00:04:58,302 --> 00:04:59,963
by the Italian statistician

155
00:05:00,067 --> 00:05:00,905
Corrado Gini,

156
00:05:01,072 --> 00:05:02,721
thus called the GINI index.

157
00:05:03,372 --> 00:05:04,659
He had the idea

158
00:05:04,825 --> 00:05:07,163
to use the so called Lorenz curve

159
00:05:07,321 --> 00:05:10,370
to calculate inequality index.

160
00:05:10,671 --> 00:05:12,485
The Lorenz curve is obtained

161
00:05:12,661 --> 00:05:15,011
by drafting cumulative income

162
00:05:15,178 --> 00:05:17,702
as a function of cumulative population.

163
00:05:18,056 --> 00:05:19,007
In other words,

164
00:05:19,165 --> 00:05:21,028
you list the poorest on the left

165
00:05:21,196 --> 00:05:22,496
of the horizontal axis

166
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:23,929
and then sum up the population

167
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:25,820
in ascending order by degree of wealth,

168
00:05:25,986 --> 00:05:27,186
up to the richest.

169
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,335
You then divide everything

170
00:05:29,506 --> 00:05:31,019
by the total number of people

171
00:05:31,196 --> 00:05:32,171
and you get an axis

172
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:34,471
with the cumulative share of the population

173
00:05:34,628 --> 00:05:37,940
ranked from the lowest to the highest income.

174
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,594
On the vertical axis you represent 

175
00:05:40,768 --> 00:05:43,169
the cumulative share of income earned.

176
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:44,379
If we consider

177
00:05:44,458 --> 00:05:46,008
a perfectly equal society

178
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,162
you would have to have

179
00:05:47,252 --> 00:05:48,827
the poorest 30% of the people

180
00:05:48,936 --> 00:05:50,711
owning 30% of the income,

181
00:05:50,807 --> 00:05:52,021
the poorest 50%

182
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:53,820
having 50% of the income

183
00:05:53,939 --> 00:05:54,714
and so forth.

184
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:55,822
The Lorenz curve

185
00:05:55,921 --> 00:05:57,472
of such a hypothetical country

186
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,580
would be the straight line, in blue.

187
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:01,942
Unfortunately, in the real world,

188
00:06:02,095 --> 00:06:04,220
income is not evenly distributed: 

189
00:06:04,353 --> 00:06:05,766
some parts of the population

190
00:06:05,941 --> 00:06:08,216
have much more income than others.

191
00:06:08,398 --> 00:06:10,510
So the Lorenz curve really looks like

192
00:06:10,662 --> 00:06:12,225
the yellow one, where you can see

193
00:06:12,323 --> 00:06:14,610
that the poorest 30% of the population

194
00:06:14,778 --> 00:06:17,215
own only roughly 10% of the income,

195
00:06:17,368 --> 00:06:18,767
while the richest 10%

196
00:06:18,926 --> 00:06:20,575
get about 30% of the income.

197
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:23,068
The Gini index measures

198
00:06:23,167 --> 00:06:24,817
the area between the Lorenz curve

199
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:26,226
and the hypothetical line

200
00:06:26,335 --> 00:06:27,797
of absolute equality.

201
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:29,936
This is expressed as a percentage

202
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:32,116
of the maximum area under the line

203
00:06:32,288 --> 00:06:34,875
or A over A plus B.

204
00:06:35,029 --> 00:06:37,116
Thus a Gini index of 0

205
00:06:37,286 --> 00:06:38,811
represents perfect equality:

206
00:06:38,963 --> 00:06:41,438
the yellow curve would be identical

207
00:06:41,611 --> 00:06:43,011
with the straight blue line.

208
00:06:43,334 --> 00:06:45,310
An index of 1

209
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,268
implies perfect inequality

210
00:06:47,435 --> 00:06:48,285
which would mean that

211
00:06:48,372 --> 00:06:50,161
one person gets all the income,

212
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:51,620
and all the others get none.

213
00:06:51,751 --> 00:06:53,664
This index can now be applied

214
00:06:53,828 --> 00:06:54,740
to look at how

215
00:06:54,910 --> 00:06:56,898
unequal different countries are.

216
00:06:57,613 --> 00:06:59,225
Here is a list of some countries'

217
00:06:59,371 --> 00:07:00,383
GINI indices.

218
00:07:00,538 --> 00:07:01,375
As you can see,

219
00:07:01,542 --> 00:07:03,392
it is not because a country is poor

220
00:07:03,563 --> 00:07:06,100
that it has a high level of inequality:

221
00:07:06,263 --> 00:07:09,014
Tanzania which is a low-income country

222
00:07:09,185 --> 00:07:11,197
is less unequal than the United States,

223
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:12,786
which is a High-income country. 

224
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,808
South Africa on the contrary

225
00:07:14,963 --> 00:07:16,851
is an upper-middle income country

226
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:19,171
with has a very high Gini index.

227
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:21,163
This indicates that there are

228
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,460
wide differences

229
00:07:22,617 --> 00:07:25,129
in income across the population.

230
00:07:25,306 --> 00:07:26,981
Together with GDP,

231
00:07:27,156 --> 00:07:28,193
the Gini index

232
00:07:28,353 --> 00:07:29,990
provide convenient ways

233
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:31,979
to explore and measure progress

234
00:07:32,142 --> 00:07:33,492
with regards to poverty

235
00:07:33,608 --> 00:07:34,671
and its distribution.

236
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,862
However these metrics are based on

237
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,134
monetary dimensions.

238
00:07:38,297 --> 00:07:39,334
As we have seen,

239
00:07:39,404 --> 00:07:40,878
poverty is multi-dimensional.

240
00:07:40,962 --> 00:07:42,350
So let us now turn

241
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,448
to some non-monetary metrics

242
00:07:44,597 --> 00:07:45,560
and indicators

243
00:07:45,645 --> 00:07:46,969
for the state of well-being.

244
00:07:47,137 --> 00:07:49,013
There are numerous such metrics

245
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:49,891
which measure

246
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,465
any of the different dimensions

247
00:07:51,569 --> 00:07:52,356
of poverty.

248
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,595
We will pick just two,

249
00:07:53,772 --> 00:07:55,385
one in the area of health

250
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:56,723
and the other in the area

251
00:07:56,812 --> 00:07:58,275
of Education.

252
00:07:58,441 --> 00:08:00,353
Life expectancy at birth

253
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:01,809
is a health indicator

254
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:02,868
that is calculated

255
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:05,270
based on a number of assumptions.

256
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:08,186
It represents the number of years

257
00:08:08,364 --> 00:08:10,089
a newborn infant would live

258
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:12,496
if prevailing patterns of mortality

259
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:14,406
at the time of its birth

260
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:15,763
were to stay the same

261
00:08:15,943 --> 00:08:17,043
throughout its life.

262
00:08:17,224 --> 00:08:18,624
It incorporates

263
00:08:18,787 --> 00:08:20,263
the mortality patterns

264
00:08:20,437 --> 00:08:22,750
that prevail across all age groups

265
00:08:22,923 --> 00:08:24,186
in a given year – children,

266
00:08:24,298 --> 00:08:26,361
adolescents, adults and the elderly.

267
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:28,725
In this table we have listed

268
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:30,644
the average Life Expectancy

269
00:08:30,735 --> 00:08:32,110
at birth per income group

270
00:08:32,272 --> 00:08:34,910
according to the world-bank classification.

271
00:08:35,252 --> 00:08:36,752
Obviously, at first sight,

272
00:08:36,923 --> 00:08:38,473
countries with higher incomes

273
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:40,084
have a longer life expectancy:

274
00:08:40,367 --> 00:08:41,967
there are more funds available

275
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,143
to pay for healthcare,

276
00:08:43,267 --> 00:08:44,329
clean drinking water

277
00:08:44,427 --> 00:08:45,565
and good quality food.

278
00:08:45,785 --> 00:08:46,973
Things are of course

279
00:08:47,142 --> 00:08:48,829
a bit more complicated than that.

280
00:08:48,989 --> 00:08:50,289
For example if we consider

281
00:08:50,467 --> 00:08:52,592
an African country like Cameroon.

282
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,026
Its Life expectancy at birth

283
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,275
is as low as 55 years.

284
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,608
However, this very low value

285
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:00,747
is largely influenced

286
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:02,223
by the shockingly high level

287
00:09:02,317 --> 00:09:04,167
of child mortality in this country:

288
00:09:04,346 --> 00:09:06,859
Cameroon has an infant mortality rate

289
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:10,226
of 88 children for every 1000 live births

290
00:09:10,385 --> 00:09:11,485
as compared to

291
00:09:11,669 --> 00:09:13,869
7 for every 1000 live births

292
00:09:14,056 --> 00:09:15,056
in the United States.

293
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:16,020
In other words,

294
00:09:16,188 --> 00:09:17,837
a child is over 10 times

295
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,303
more likely to die

296
00:09:19,471 --> 00:09:21,546
before reaching its 5th birthday

297
00:09:21,731 --> 00:09:22,530
in Cameroon,

298
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:24,259
 than it would in the United States.

299
00:09:24,423 --> 00:09:27,023
This, of course, significantly reduces

300
00:09:27,197 --> 00:09:29,397
the overall Life expectancy at birth.

301
00:09:29,581 --> 00:09:32,494
As with any single numerical indicator,

302
00:09:32,662 --> 00:09:34,649
one has to remain cautious

303
00:09:34,828 --> 00:09:37,078
about how the indicator is constructed:

304
00:09:37,237 --> 00:09:38,549
what it accounts for

305
00:09:38,741 --> 00:09:40,053
and, what it doesn’t.

306
00:09:40,238 --> 00:09:42,875
The second non-monetary metric

307
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:44,549
characterizes education.

308
00:09:44,721 --> 00:09:45,746
It is called

309
00:09:45,917 --> 00:09:47,642
 the primary school completion rate.

310
00:09:47,824 --> 00:09:48,987
This factor measures

311
00:09:49,163 --> 00:09:50,263
the proportion of people

312
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:51,556
entering the last grade

313
00:09:51,639 --> 00:09:52,890
of primary education

314
00:09:53,047 --> 00:09:54,497
compared to all the people

315
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:56,378
who would have the age to be enrolled.

316
00:09:56,555 --> 00:09:59,642
In this table you can see that in Chad,

317
00:09:59,826 --> 00:10:01,664
which is one of the poorest countries,

318
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,890
not even 40% of the population

319
00:10:04,069 --> 00:10:05,681
finishes primary education.

320
00:10:05,852 --> 00:10:08,215
The difference between male and female

321
00:10:08,306 --> 00:10:09,682
is also very important.

322
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:11,525
It is thus very sad

323
00:10:11,688 --> 00:10:14,313
that less than one in 3 girls

324
00:10:14,497 --> 00:10:16,285
can achieve only primary education,

325
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:17,875
let alone secondary.

326
00:10:18,054 --> 00:10:19,441
This is obviously sad

327
00:10:19,521 --> 00:10:20,621
for the people themselves,

328
00:10:20,788 --> 00:10:22,738
but sad as well from the perspectives

329
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,004
of that country.

330
00:10:24,177 --> 00:10:25,040
We will now turn

331
00:10:25,149 --> 00:10:27,774
to the last type of metrics,

332
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:29,623
which we called composite,

333
00:10:29,779 --> 00:10:31,941
because they involve both monetary

334
00:10:32,018 --> 00:10:33,730
and non-monetary parameters.

335
00:10:33,908 --> 00:10:36,008
Let us look at one such metric

336
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:38,575
called the Human Development Index.

337
00:10:38,741 --> 00:10:41,516
It was first proposed in the 1990s

338
00:10:41,687 --> 00:10:42,575
by the United Nations

339
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,905
Development Program.

340
00:10:44,092 --> 00:10:45,817
The Human Development Index

341
00:10:45,985 --> 00:10:47,935
is a geometric mean

342
00:10:48,112 --> 00:10:50,649
of the Life Expectancy index,

343
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,970
times the Education Index,

344
00:10:53,147 --> 00:10:55,159
times the Income Index.

345
00:10:55,345 --> 00:10:58,620
The Life Expectancy Index, or LEI,

346
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:01,543
is based on life expectancy at birth,

347
00:11:01,726 --> 00:11:03,351
which we have just have seen.

348
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:05,687
The Education Index, or EI,

349
00:11:05,866 --> 00:11:07,904
is a combination of mean years

350
00:11:07,989 --> 00:11:08,789
of schooling

351
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,546
and expected years of schooling,

352
00:11:10,721 --> 00:11:13,671
and is yet another non-monetary index.

353
00:11:13,844 --> 00:11:17,056
Finally, the Income Index, or II,

354
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:19,060
is based on the logarithmic value

355
00:11:19,224 --> 00:11:20,849
of the Gross National Income

356
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:23,984
expressed in PPP dollars per capita.

357
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:25,911
All these indices

358
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:27,644
are normalized in order to have

359
00:11:27,815 --> 00:11:30,603
a value between 0 (worst) and 1,

360
00:11:30,716 --> 00:11:32,566
which represents an aspirational

361
00:11:32,647 --> 00:11:34,284
but realistic goal to be reached

362
00:11:34,452 --> 00:11:36,089
in that particular dimension:

363
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:38,935
for example a life expectancy

364
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,350
of 85 years in a particular country,

365
00:11:41,523 --> 00:11:43,386
which corresponds to the highest

366
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:45,061
level reached worldwide,

367
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:46,356
would give this country

368
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,773
a Life Expectancy Index of 1.

369
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,760
The Human Development Index

370
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:52,381
is used by the United Nations 

371
00:11:52,502 --> 00:11:53,565
Development Program

372
00:11:53,676 --> 00:11:54,613
to rank countries:

373
00:11:54,804 --> 00:11:56,516
Let’s look at a few of them. 

374
00:11:56,705 --> 00:11:58,130
The table represents

375
00:11:58,292 --> 00:11:59,755
the Human Development Index

376
00:11:59,866 --> 00:12:01,041
in the second column,

377
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:02,304
and in the third column,

378
00:12:02,461 --> 00:12:03,573
the country’s ranking

379
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:05,811
when compared to others.

380
00:12:06,005 --> 00:12:07,905
There aren’t any big surprises 

381
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:08,954
at first glance:

382
00:12:09,123 --> 00:12:10,311
high-income countries

383
00:12:10,431 --> 00:12:12,106
have a higher Human Development Index

384
00:12:12,288 --> 00:12:14,126
and of course tend to rank better

385
00:12:14,281 --> 00:12:15,594
than low income countries.

386
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,898
Differences do appear however

387
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:18,903
if you compare

388
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:20,301
the ranking of South Africa,

389
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,740
based on the  Human Development Index,

390
00:12:22,918 --> 00:12:25,193
with the ranking based on GDP:

391
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:27,703
If we refer to GDP,

392
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,094
South Africa ranks 84th,

393
00:12:30,347 --> 00:12:32,746
while it is only 116th

394
00:12:32,927 --> 00:12:35,164
if you look at Human Development Index.

395
00:12:35,358 --> 00:12:37,045
This, of course reflects

396
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:39,279
 the influence of non-monetary metrics

397
00:12:39,462 --> 00:12:41,412
such as Life expectancy

398
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:42,689
that is accounted for

399
00:12:42,861 --> 00:12:44,186
in the Human Development Index

400
00:12:44,345 --> 00:12:45,495
but not in GDP.

401
00:12:45,945 --> 00:12:46,620
In effect,

402
00:12:46,801 --> 00:12:48,314
the life expectancy at birth

403
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:51,168
in South Africa is only 57 years

404
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,940
which explains the difference. 

405
00:12:53,253 --> 00:12:54,265
We have now been able

406
00:12:54,349 --> 00:12:55,587
to scratch the surface

407
00:12:55,686 --> 00:12:57,162
of this very complex question

408
00:12:57,247 --> 00:12:58,660
of what is poverty.

409
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,861
We have learned to characterize it

410
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,363
using Monetary, non-monetary

411
00:13:02,477 --> 00:13:03,790
and composite metrics.

412
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,209
This will give us

413
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:06,870
the necessary background

414
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:08,850
for the remainder of this course

415
00:13:09,023 --> 00:13:10,510
on how to reduce poverty

416
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,661
through innovation

417
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,475
and technology development.

418
00:13:13,953 --> 00:13:15,303
Good Bye.
