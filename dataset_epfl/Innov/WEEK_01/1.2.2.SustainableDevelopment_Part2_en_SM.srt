1
00:00:09,829 --> 00:00:10,591
 Hello.

2
00:00:11,105 --> 00:00:12,630
This lecture is a follow-up from

3
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,739
the Millennium Development Goals
that we discussed before.

4
00:00:15,914 --> 00:00:17,615
Which subsequently gave rise to 

5
00:00:17,801 --> 00:00:21,182
the Sustainable Development Goals,
or SDGs.

6
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:23,392
The SDGs build on the success

7
00:00:23,579 --> 00:00:25,626
of the Millennium Development Goals

8
00:00:26,095 --> 00:00:28,084
and aim to go further towards

9
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:30,150
ending all forms of poverty.

10
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,355
The new goals are unique

11
00:00:32,530 --> 00:00:35,010
in that they call for action
by all countries,

12
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:38,198
including poor, rich 
and middle income,

13
00:00:38,724 --> 00:00:40,896
to unite and promote prosperity

14
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:42,852
while protecting the planet.

15
00:00:43,154 --> 00:00:46,391
They recognize that ending poverty
must go hand in hand

16
00:00:46,584 --> 00:00:49,209
with strategies that 
build economic growth

17
00:00:49,397 --> 00:00:51,810
and address a range of social needs

18
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:56,191
while tackling climate change 
and environmental protection.

19
00:00:57,348 --> 00:01:00,161
On the 1st of January, 2016

20
00:01:00,372 --> 00:01:03,409
the 17 Sustainable Development Goals

21
00:01:03,615 --> 00:01:06,738
of the 2030 Agenda 
for Sustainable Development

22
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:08,831
officially came into force.

23
00:01:09,405 --> 00:01:11,292
And what are these SDGs?

24
00:01:11,996 --> 00:01:15,745
Goal 1 is to end poverty,
in all its forms,

25
00:01:15,935 --> 00:01:17,823
everywhere, by 2030.

26
00:01:18,338 --> 00:01:20,301
There are still almost 900 million people

27
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:21,909
living in extreme poverty.

28
00:01:22,443 --> 00:01:24,793
And the overwhelming majority
of those people

29
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:28,834
are in sub-Saharan Africa
and southern Asia.

30
00:01:29,546 --> 00:01:31,358
Goal 2 aims to end hunger,

31
00:01:31,855 --> 00:01:34,442
achieve food security 
and improved nutrition,

32
00:01:34,624 --> 00:01:36,623
and promote sustainable agriculture.

33
00:01:37,326 --> 00:01:39,864
By 2030, we should end hunger

34
00:01:40,052 --> 00:01:41,648
and ensure access by all

35
00:01:41,835 --> 00:01:44,210
to enough food all year round,

36
00:01:44,398 --> 00:01:46,948
especially to those 
at the bottom of the pyramid.

37
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,432
This goal is intended to encourage us

38
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,849
to rethink how we grow, share

39
00:01:52,034 --> 00:01:53,746
and consume our food.

40
00:01:54,237 --> 00:01:56,113
The food and agriculture sector

41
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,175
offer key solutions for development,

42
00:01:58,364 --> 00:02:00,102
especially rural development,

43
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:03,499
and is central for 
hunger and poverty eradication.

44
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:06,542
Goal 3 aims to ensure healthy lives

45
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:09,867
and promote well-being for all, 
and at all ages.

46
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:12,612
Significant strides have been made

47
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,326
in increasing life expectancy

48
00:02:14,504 --> 00:02:16,445
and reducing some of 
the common killers

49
00:02:16,626 --> 00:02:19,589
associated with child
and maternal mortality.

50
00:02:20,225 --> 00:02:21,517
However, many more efforts

51
00:02:21,705 --> 00:02:23,473
are still needed to fully eradicate

52
00:02:23,653 --> 00:02:24,829
a wide range of diseases

53
00:02:25,022 --> 00:02:28,913
and address many persistent 
and emerging health issues.

54
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:33,794
Goal 4: to ensure inclusive 
and quality education for all

55
00:02:33,984 --> 00:02:35,984
 and promote lifelong learning.

56
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:38,760
Major progress has been made

57
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,966
towards increasing access 
to education at all levels

58
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:44,925
and increasing enrollment rates in schools,

59
00:02:45,103 --> 00:02:46,990
particularly for women and girls.

60
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,538
But bolder efforts are still needed

61
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:51,325
to make even greater strides

62
00:02:51,503 --> 00:02:54,941
for achieving these 
universal education goals.

63
00:02:56,367 --> 00:02:58,904
Goal 5 aims to achieve gender equality

64
00:02:59,088 --> 00:03:01,939
and empower all women and girls.

65
00:03:02,957 --> 00:03:04,863
While the world has achieved progress

66
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,399
towards gender equality 
and women empowerment

67
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,601
under the Millennium Development Goals,

68
00:03:09,787 --> 00:03:11,551
women and girls continue to suffer

69
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:13,979
discrimination and violence world over.

70
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:16,414
The SDGs view gender equality

71
00:03:16,596 --> 00:03:18,684
as not only a 
fundamental human right,

72
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:20,580
but a necessary foundation

73
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:23,911
for a peaceful, prosperous 
and sustainable world.

74
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:26,832
Goal 6 seeks to ensure access

75
00:03:27,016 --> 00:03:28,916
to water and sanitation for all.

76
00:03:29,294 --> 00:03:30,715
Because water scarcity,

77
00:03:30,902 --> 00:03:34,066
poor water quality 
and inadequate sanitation

78
00:03:34,258 --> 00:03:38,381
have a significant negative impact
on quality of life overall.

79
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,622
Drought afflicts some of 
the world’s poorest countries,

80
00:03:41,814 --> 00:03:43,677
worsening hunger and malnutrition.

81
00:03:43,958 --> 00:03:45,399
Meanwhile, there is sufficient

82
00:03:45,582 --> 00:03:47,815
fresh water on the planet 
to achieve this goal,

83
00:03:47,995 --> 00:03:49,995
but it requires better economic systems

84
00:03:50,182 --> 00:03:51,657
and suitable infrastructure.

85
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,373
Goal 7 is to ensure access

86
00:03:54,555 --> 00:03:57,080
to affordable, reliable, sustainable

87
00:03:57,268 --> 00:03:59,207
and modern energy for all.

88
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:01,105
Because as we know,

89
00:04:01,289 --> 00:04:03,790
energy is central 
to nearly every major challenge

90
00:04:03,982 --> 00:04:06,371
and opportunity the world faces today.

91
00:04:06,837 --> 00:04:08,150
But at the same time,

92
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:10,983
we have to make sure that 
the energy solutions we adopt

93
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:13,961
do not negatively impact the environment.

94
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:16,362
And goal 8 seeks to promote

95
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:19,601
inclusive and sustainable 
economic growth,

96
00:04:20,265 --> 00:04:22,178
employment and decent work for all.

97
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:25,067
Today, about half 
of the world’s population

98
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:28,153
still lives on the equivalent 
of about US$2 a day.

99
00:04:28,908 --> 00:04:32,757
Thus, solutions are urgently required
that will allow people

100
00:04:32,945 --> 00:04:36,032
to have quality jobs 
that stimulate the economy,

101
00:04:36,215 --> 00:04:39,141
while not necessarily
harming the environment.

102
00:04:40,196 --> 00:04:42,845
Goal 9 aims to build 
resilient infrastructure,

103
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:45,094
promote sustainable industrialization

104
00:04:45,281 --> 00:04:46,933
 and foster innovation.

105
00:04:47,215 --> 00:04:48,802
Investments in infrastructure,

106
00:04:48,986 --> 00:04:50,838
such as transport, irrigation, energy,

107
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:53,375
and information and communication technology

108
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:56,322
are crucial to achieving 
sustainable development

109
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:58,815
and empowering communities 
in many countries. 

110
00:04:59,187 --> 00:05:00,808
It has long been recognized

111
00:05:00,985 --> 00:05:03,611
that growth in productivity and income  

112
00:05:04,165 --> 00:05:07,152
and improvements in 
health and education outcomes 

113
00:05:07,337 --> 00:05:10,262
require investment in infrastructure.

114
00:05:10,825 --> 00:05:13,412
Inclusive and sustainable 
industrial development

115
00:05:13,597 --> 00:05:16,047
is the primary source 
of income generation.

116
00:05:16,911 --> 00:05:19,673
It allows for rapid 
and sustained increases

117
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:21,876
in living standards for all people,

118
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,247
and provides 
the technological solutions

119
00:05:24,433 --> 00:05:27,296
to environmentally sound industrialization.

120
00:05:27,697 --> 00:05:29,247
And technological progress

121
00:05:29,431 --> 00:05:32,306
is the foundation 
of sustainable industrialization.

122
00:05:34,016 --> 00:05:36,516
Goal 10 aims to reduce inequality

123
00:05:36,705 --> 00:05:38,918
within and among countries.

124
00:05:39,152 --> 00:05:42,088
The international community
has made significant strides

125
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:44,154
towards lifting people out of poverty.

126
00:05:44,369 --> 00:05:46,318
However, inequality still persists

127
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:48,977
and large disparities remain
with respect to

128
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:52,218
access to health, education
and other assets. 

129
00:05:52,882 --> 00:05:55,193
Additionally, while income inequality

130
00:05:55,373 --> 00:05:57,961
between countries 
may have been reduced, 

131
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:03,047
inequality though, 
within countries, has risen.

132
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,408
There is growing consensus that

133
00:06:05,581 --> 00:06:08,167
economic growth is not sufficient 
to reduce poverty

134
00:06:08,341 --> 00:06:10,791
if it is not inclusive
and if it does not involve

135
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:13,434
the 3 dimensions 
of sustainable development:

136
00:06:14,496 --> 00:06:17,533
economic, social 
and environmental factors.

137
00:06:18,581 --> 00:06:20,843
Goal 11 aims to make cities

138
00:06:21,025 --> 00:06:22,313
inclusive, safe

139
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,645
resilient and sustainable.

140
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,881
Cities are considered to be 
hubs for ideas,

141
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:28,946
commerce, culture,

142
00:06:29,126 --> 00:06:30,302
science, productivity,

143
00:06:30,491 --> 00:06:32,142
social development and much more.

144
00:06:33,094 --> 00:06:35,794
Common urban challenges 
include congestion,

145
00:06:35,967 --> 00:06:39,067
lack of funds 
to provide basic services,

146
00:06:39,247 --> 00:06:41,059
a shortage of adequate housing,

147
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:42,787
and declining infrastructure. 

148
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,094
While Goal 12 aims to ensure

149
00:06:46,277 --> 00:06:48,815
sustainable consumption 
and production patterns.

150
00:06:49,624 --> 00:06:52,511
Because sustainable 
production and consumption

151
00:06:52,691 --> 00:06:55,717
 is about promoting 
resource and energy efficiency, 

152
00:06:56,185 --> 00:06:57,660
sustainable infrastructure,

153
00:06:57,864 --> 00:07:00,339
and providing access to basic services

154
00:07:00,842 --> 00:07:02,608
and green and decent jobs,

155
00:07:03,189 --> 00:07:05,422
Its implementation will help to achieve

156
00:07:05,609 --> 00:07:07,220
overall development plans,

157
00:07:07,523 --> 00:07:11,201
reduce future economic, 
 environmental and social costs,

158
00:07:11,383 --> 00:07:13,887
while strengthening
economic competitiveness.

159
00:07:14,454 --> 00:07:16,431
Sustainable consumption and production

160
00:07:16,613 --> 00:07:19,901
aims at doing more 
(and better) with less,

161
00:07:20,088 --> 00:07:23,690
increasing net welfare gains 
from economic activities, 

162
00:07:23,868 --> 00:07:26,261
by reducing resource use, degradation

163
00:07:26,447 --> 00:07:28,967
and pollution along 
the whole lifecycle,

164
00:07:29,154 --> 00:07:31,731
while increasing the quality of life overall.

165
00:07:31,999 --> 00:07:34,627
It thus requires the involvement
of different stakeholders,

166
00:07:34,821 --> 00:07:36,359
including businesses, consumers,

167
00:07:36,548 --> 00:07:38,577
policy makers, researchers,

168
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,443
scientists, media

169
00:07:40,618 --> 00:07:44,105
and development cooperation agencies, 
amongst others.

170
00:07:44,283 --> 00:07:47,115
Goal 13 aims to take urgent action

171
00:07:47,293 --> 00:07:50,218
 to combat climate change 
and its impact.

172
00:07:51,081 --> 00:07:54,143
While goal 14 aims to conserve

173
00:07:54,337 --> 00:07:56,286
and sustainably use the oceans,

174
00:07:56,475 --> 00:07:58,143
seas and marine resources.

175
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:01,016
Because now climate change is affecting

176
00:08:01,196 --> 00:08:02,845
 every country on every continent,

177
00:08:03,022 --> 00:08:05,786
it is disrupting national economies
and affecting life,

178
00:08:06,191 --> 00:08:08,860
costing people, communities 
and countries dearly.

179
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:12,032
But climate change is a global challenge

180
00:08:12,218 --> 00:08:14,175
that does not respect national borders.

181
00:08:14,837 --> 00:08:17,362
Emissions anywhere 
affect people everywhere.

182
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,478
It is an issue that requires solutions

183
00:08:19,653 --> 00:08:22,376
that need to be coordinated 
at the international level

184
00:08:22,552 --> 00:08:24,778
and it requires 
international cooperation

185
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,036
to help developing countries move toward

186
00:08:27,219 --> 00:08:28,994
a low-carbon economy.

187
00:08:30,315 --> 00:08:33,427
Goal 15 aims to 
sustainably manage forests,

188
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:35,347
combat desertification,

189
00:08:35,525 --> 00:08:37,700
halt and reverse land degradation

190
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:40,490
and also halt biodiversity loss.

191
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:44,185
The world’s oceans, as we said,

192
00:08:44,365 --> 00:08:46,382
drive global systems
that make the Earth

193
00:08:46,562 --> 00:08:48,093
habitable for humankind.

194
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:50,582
Our rainwater, drinking water,

195
00:08:50,773 --> 00:08:52,196
weather, climate, coastlines,

196
00:08:52,371 --> 00:08:53,271
much of our food

197
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,748
and even the oxygen 
in the air we breathe

198
00:08:55,930 --> 00:08:58,581
are ultimately provided 
and regulated by the sea. 

199
00:08:59,097 --> 00:09:00,859
Throughout history, oceans and seas

200
00:09:01,046 --> 00:09:02,733
have been vital conduits

201
00:09:02,921 --> 00:09:04,605
for trade and transportation.

202
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:08,506
So careful management 
of this essential global resource

203
00:09:08,694 --> 00:09:11,948
is a key feature 
for a sustainable future.

204
00:09:12,549 --> 00:09:14,568
Goal 16 aims to promote just,

205
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:17,085
peaceful and inclusive societies.

206
00:09:18,529 --> 00:09:20,135
It is dedicated to the promotion

207
00:09:20,321 --> 00:09:23,497
of peaceful and inclusive society 
for sustainable development,

208
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,740
the provision of 
access to justice for all,

209
00:09:25,924 --> 00:09:29,436
and building effective and accountable 
institutions at all levels.

210
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:32,222
While goal 17 aims to revitalize

211
00:09:32,409 --> 00:09:35,073
the global partnership 
for sustainable development.

212
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:37,567
A successful sustainable development agenda

213
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,984
requires partnerships between governments,

214
00:09:40,168 --> 00:09:42,197
the private sector and civil society.

215
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:45,142
Efforts are needed 
to mobilize, redirect,

216
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,166
and unlock the transformative power

217
00:09:47,342 --> 00:09:49,586
of trillions of dollars 
of private resources

218
00:09:49,761 --> 00:09:52,293
to deliver on 
sustainable development objectives.

219
00:09:52,585 --> 00:09:54,064
Now before we conclude this lesson,

220
00:09:54,243 --> 00:09:56,498
I’m sure some of you 
might be asking yourselves

221
00:09:56,686 --> 00:09:59,235
why should one really care about SDGs.

222
00:09:59,735 --> 00:10:01,969
If you’re an engineer 
or scientist for example,

223
00:10:02,232 --> 00:10:04,680
and you wish to develop 
an essential technology

224
00:10:04,867 --> 00:10:06,903
that may make a positive contribution

225
00:10:07,092 --> 00:10:09,009
to global sustainable development,

226
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,607
where would you begin?

227
00:10:12,062 --> 00:10:14,004
I would say an excellent starting point

228
00:10:14,187 --> 00:10:15,303
is by understanding the SDGs,

229
00:10:15,486 --> 00:10:18,139
because even many of 
the global expert organizations

230
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:21,656
such as the World Health Organization,
for example (the WHO),

231
00:10:22,049 --> 00:10:23,756
who are entrusted with the mission

232
00:10:23,935 --> 00:10:26,123
of making recommendations or guidelines

233
00:10:26,311 --> 00:10:29,140
for safe technologies 
and health measures,

234
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:32,319
will always look to align 
their policies and strategies

235
00:10:32,507 --> 00:10:34,165
with the SDGs.

236
00:10:34,612 --> 00:10:36,441
Major funding organizations, such as

237
00:10:36,617 --> 00:10:37,846
The Gates Foundation,

238
00:10:38,033 --> 00:10:39,630
 Welcome Trust, etc.,

239
00:10:39,819 --> 00:10:42,557
typically align their strategies and priorities

240
00:10:42,745 --> 00:10:44,025
with such an initiative.

241
00:10:44,578 --> 00:10:46,472
 And same goes for a company

242
00:10:46,661 --> 00:10:48,698
that wishes to expand internationally

243
00:10:48,882 --> 00:10:52,185
or establish a 
Corporate Social Responsibility Strategy.

244
00:10:53,048 --> 00:10:57,042
They would surely benefit by looking
at SDGs to inspire their strategy.

245
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,326
And the list goes on.
