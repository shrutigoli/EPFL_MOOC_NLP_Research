1
00:00:18,948 --> 00:00:22,470
We will now come to the role
of technology in development

2
00:00:22,673 --> 00:00:25,435
in the fight against poverty.

3
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:28,306
This course is entitled
Technology Innovation

4
00:00:28,506 --> 00:00:31,298
for Sustainable Development.

5
00:00:31,498 --> 00:00:33,364
Without venturing too much 
into semantics, 

6
00:00:33,564 --> 00:00:36,442
which is beyond the scope of
the topic today,

7
00:00:36,642 --> 00:00:41,916
my colleague Klaus here will  explain
to us what is meant

8
00:00:42,153 --> 00:00:45,284
by the words
technology and innovation.

9
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,615
There is a lot of literature
and arguing

10
00:00:48,815 --> 00:00:51,765
about the definition of the concept
of technology.

11
00:00:51,965 --> 00:00:56,571
For example, let me cite
an American sociologist, Read Bain

12
00:00:56,771 --> 00:01:00,871
who wrote the following
definition in 1937 :

13
00:01:01,033 --> 00:01:05,321
Broadly conceived, technology is 
the most important single factor

14
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:09,413
in producing, integrating
and destroying cultural phenomena. 

15
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:14,198
Technology includes all tools,
machines, utensils, weapons,

16
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:19,111
instruments, housing, clothing,
communicating and transporting devices 

17
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:21,901
and the skills by which
we produce and use them.

18
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,264
Note that the citation includes
a list of different technology types. 

19
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:30,233
Of course, what counts here is
the fact that technology

20
00:01:30,433 --> 00:01:33,570
is about objects,
tools and the skills 

21
00:01:33,770 --> 00:01:35,426
by which we produce and use them.

22
00:01:35,889 --> 00:01:38,419
We should obviously
also include “information” 

23
00:01:38,632 --> 00:01:41,404
as we are now in
the information age.

24
00:01:42,196 --> 00:01:44,604
For the sake of simplicity,
we would like to use another

25
00:01:44,804 --> 00:01:47,760
more concise definition
for the purpose of this course. 

26
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,156
The Oxford Dictionary defines
technology as "Machinery and devices

27
00:01:53,437 --> 00:01:55,495
developed from
scientific knowledge.” 

28
00:01:55,955 --> 00:01:58,802
This definition is simpler
and captures the essence 

29
00:01:59,015 --> 00:02:02,587
of the concept of technology
as we need it in this course. 

30
00:02:03,258 --> 00:02:05,343
This is the definition
we would like you

31
00:02:05,543 --> 00:02:07,487
to bear in mind as we move forward. 

32
00:02:08,328 --> 00:02:12,137
Humankind has used technologies
since prehistoric times

33
00:02:12,337 --> 00:02:14,693
and has always sought
to improve them. 

34
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:17,824
Quite obviously, new
and improved technology 

35
00:02:18,024 --> 00:02:21,262
can provide competitive
and evolutionary advantages. 

36
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:25,549
To look for new techniques or tools
to do things better,

37
00:02:25,749 --> 00:02:29,967
cheaper, quicker is therefore
in the very nature of humans. 

38
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:34,630
The title of our MOOC says
Technology Innovation.

39
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,990
My colleague, Soli,
will now give you

40
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:39,943
a simplified definition
of innovation.

41
00:02:40,736 --> 00:02:44,127
In equally simple terms,
Innovation can be defined as: 

42
00:02:44,327 --> 00:02:47,650
the action of making changes
in something established,

43
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,073
especially by introducing
new methods, ideas, or products.

44
00:02:52,767 --> 00:02:55,930
Note that it is not just about
coming up with new ideas,

45
00:02:56,130 --> 00:02:59,249
but a lot more about
effectively applying them

46
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:03,802
so as to really meet the needs
or expectations of the beneficiary.

47
00:03:04,002 --> 00:03:06,135
So, for the purposes
of this course

48
00:03:06,335 --> 00:03:08,839
Technology Innovation
is thus defined as:

49
00:03:09,039 --> 00:03:12,521
"Making changes by creating
new machinery and devices,

50
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:16,242
developed from scientific knowledge
and deploying them

51
00:03:16,442 --> 00:03:19,294
in a way that fulfills
needs and aspirations 

52
00:03:19,494 --> 00:03:23,536
of the beneficiaries and 
their respective communities.

53
00:03:24,531 --> 00:03:28,123
As we will see later, this will
generally involve a product

54
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:32,531
and creative implementation planning,
such as a business plan

55
00:03:32,731 --> 00:03:34,910
and an impact plan.

56
00:03:35,558 --> 00:03:39,348
Poverty is a terrible trap
but technology innovation

57
00:03:39,548 --> 00:03:42,939
can be a key enabler
towards solving difficult social,

58
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,094
economic
and environmental challenges.

59
00:03:46,294 --> 00:03:49,245
However, new technologies
are not an end per se,

60
00:03:49,445 --> 00:03:52,403
they are more of a catalyst
for development. 

61
00:03:52,603 --> 00:03:55,844
Of course, technologies may also have
have unwanted by-products

62
00:03:56,044 --> 00:03:59,535
such as generating pollution,
depleting natural resources

63
00:03:59,735 --> 00:04:04,464
in an unsustainable way, 
or enabling humans to wage war. 

64
00:04:04,664 --> 00:04:08,396
We will not venture into
such a philosophical debate, 

65
00:04:08,596 --> 00:04:11,680
but simply recognize that
certain technologies are essential

66
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,460
for lifting poor communities
out of poverty 

67
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,841
and improving their quality of life.

68
00:04:17,078 --> 00:04:19,260
They help fulfill basic
human needs and rights

69
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:21,898
such as health, 
shelter or education. 

70
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:25,791
Unfortunately, while many 
of these technologies are available 

71
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:28,757
in industrialized countries,
they have somehow failed

72
00:04:28,957 --> 00:04:32,842
to be successfully deployed in
Low & Middle-Income Countries

73
00:04:33,042 --> 00:04:35,269
and thus have been
unable to deliver

74
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:39,209
the desired catalytic effect
for development.  

75
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:42,723
The question we would
like to answer now is: 

76
00:04:42,923 --> 00:04:46,086
Which technologies, exactly,
could have a high potential

77
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:50,511
in reducing poverty and catalysing
sustainable development?

78
00:04:51,263 --> 00:04:55,079
Most of us will agree that weapons
would not belong in this category. 

79
00:04:55,279 --> 00:04:59,211
But other technologies, such as
those defined by Read Bain, earlier

80
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:03,100
like “housing,” seem closer
to what we are looking for, 

81
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:06,986
since having a shelter
is a basic human need.

82
00:05:07,983 --> 00:05:11,995
Klaus, will now tell you about
which technologies we could define

83
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:16,820
or consider to have a high potential
to help reduce poverty.

84
00:05:17,534 --> 00:05:20,014
Let us first try to define a concept

85
00:05:20,214 --> 00:05:22,559
which we will call
Essential Technologies.

86
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:25,759
Essential Technologies are
simply those technologies 

87
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:29,154
which can help expedite
the achievements

88
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:31,168
of the Sustainable
Development Goals.

89
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,040
Now, this sounds vague,
how can we be more specific? 

90
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,122
Soli has nicely explained
the Sustainable Development Goals

91
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:40,526
in a previous video.

92
00:05:40,726 --> 00:05:46,735
He will now try and help us identify
what those technologies are exactly. 

93
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:49,238
For the purposes of this course,
what is considered

94
00:05:49,438 --> 00:05:52,609
Essential Technologies comprises:
Food & Agriculture,

95
00:05:52,809 --> 00:05:57,204
Pharmaceuticals, Medical Equipment,
Energy

96
00:05:57,404 --> 00:05:59,867
Information and
Communication Technologies,

97
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:05,101
Transportation, Construction
and finally Water & Sanitation.

98
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:08,436
The selection of this list
was inspired by

99
00:06:08,636 --> 00:06:09,718
the Millennium Development Goals

100
00:06:09,918 --> 00:06:12,306
and the Sustainable
Development Goals.

101
00:06:13,347 --> 00:06:15,941
When we analyzed the goals
set by the UN 

102
00:06:16,141 --> 00:06:19,615
from an engineering perspective,
we observed that 

103
00:06:19,815 --> 00:06:25,421
these technology domains
stood-out as the most pertinent. 

104
00:06:26,626 --> 00:06:31,337
In the same way as the UN
have defined their specific goals 

105
00:06:31,537 --> 00:06:35,869
for a sustainable future, we believe
that it is very important

106
00:06:36,094 --> 00:06:40,518
to be able to identify
technologies that can underpin

107
00:06:40,718 --> 00:06:44,037
the achievements of these goals. 

108
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:48,485
This will allow us to focus
our efforts on the areas

109
00:06:48,685 --> 00:06:50,779
which have the highest potential.  

110
00:06:51,777 --> 00:06:54,682
However, it must be stated
that this grouping 

111
00:06:54,882 --> 00:06:59,403
is not intended to be rigid,
as in practice you may find

112
00:06:59,603 --> 00:07:03,369
various overlaps across
or in between domains. 

113
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:08,695
For example, energy and ICT
may typically be required

114
00:07:08,895 --> 00:07:10,959
in many other
technology applications 

115
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:12,811
in the other domains.

116
00:07:13,687 --> 00:07:16,287
But before we get into the question
of how to develop 

117
00:07:16,487 --> 00:07:19,221
impactful essential technologies,

118
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:22,200
in the following sessions
we will discuss

119
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,389
each of these technologies
along with

120
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:27,064
their potential role
in development.

121
00:07:27,264 --> 00:07:29,076
Good-bye.
