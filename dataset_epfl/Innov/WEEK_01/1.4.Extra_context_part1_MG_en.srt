1
00:00:04,322 --> 00:00:06,435
If we take the ratios

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,139
we train at the YaoundÃ© school
of medicine, in radiology,

3
00:00:11,338 --> 00:00:17,438
roughly 6 to 7
radiologists a year.

4
00:00:17,625 --> 00:00:23,389
And in Cameroon there are
roughly 100

5
00:00:23,574 --> 00:00:29,072
radiologists that work
for 20 million inhabitants,

6
00:00:29,388 --> 00:00:30,363
but the problem

7
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:33,298
is that if we take these numbers,
we think it's not bad!

8
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:37,689
They are not
equally dispatched,

9
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:39,705
They are concentrated

10
00:00:40,216 --> 00:00:43,637
in the urban areas,
in the big cities

11
00:00:43,922 --> 00:00:49,167
and there are whole regions
without radiologists.

12
00:00:49,357 --> 00:00:52,545
So there is a problem
with the amount,

13
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,968
and a problem
with the spatial dispatching.

14
00:00:57,156 --> 00:00:59,050
And what do they say?

15
00:01:00,118 --> 00:01:02,643
They say if you send
me to the outskirts,

16
00:01:02,836 --> 00:01:06,103
I get there
and there is no equipment!

17
00:01:06,316 --> 00:01:07,697
So what I have learnt,

18
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:10,093
I am not going to apply it,
I am going to forget everything,

19
00:01:10,289 --> 00:01:12,238
why would I go there?

20
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,841
So this is why

21
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:18,454
they will do anything to stay
in the urban areas and cities.

22
00:01:21,245 --> 00:01:23,545
I started doing
MRI scans.

23
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:28,026
But I don't know if I can
turn on a MRI machine on,

24
00:01:28,226 --> 00:01:30,939
because when I started

25
00:01:31,446 --> 00:01:32,984
the machine broke down.

26
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:37,080
What I learnt, I am
forgetting little by little

27
00:01:37,264 --> 00:01:38,852
because the machine doesn't work

28
00:01:39,027 --> 00:01:43,006
and the special exams,
we never do any.

29
00:01:43,307 --> 00:01:47,838
So I don't know what to
do if I have to do one one day.

30
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:51,473
I don't know if i could do
it without help

31
00:01:51,654 --> 00:01:54,385
maybe from a book or
I don't know

32
00:01:54,863 --> 00:02:00,015
Those are the difficulties
we encounter in our field.

33
00:02:06,448 --> 00:02:08,465
We forget for example
the doses

34
00:02:08,801 --> 00:02:10,100
For a child,
a thorax child,

35
00:02:10,275 --> 00:02:13,741
we forget the doses
and the working parameters

36
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:19,317
and we can over-radiate
an organ

37
00:02:19,586 --> 00:02:23,212
whilst the practice of
the training would permit

38
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:25,886
us to keep up
an acceptable level.

39
00:02:26,090 --> 00:02:29,811
Obviously when we don't
work for a while

40
00:02:30,346 --> 00:02:35,775
like a muscle that we
don't use, it gets weaker

41
00:02:36,587 --> 00:02:41,013
the brain could lose everything
at least its working speed

42
00:02:41,197 --> 00:02:44,859
or memory of parameters
or certain positions

43
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:48,499
to acquire the adequate images.

44
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,359
I think the principal problem

45
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:52,515
is really the personnel,

46
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:56,534
because generally we can
manage to buy an echograph machine

47
00:02:56,714 --> 00:02:59,273
when we don't yet know
how to use it

48
00:02:59,634 --> 00:03:00,884
And once the machine is there

49
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:03,758
either we will try to train someone

50
00:03:04,248 --> 00:03:06,632
or we ask the minister

51
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:08,766
and sometimes we are given
a young person

52
00:03:08,935 --> 00:03:11,935
that just finished his or her
training

53
00:03:12,117 --> 00:03:14,181
and is still
looking to learn.

54
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:17,673
So for me the main problem,

55
00:03:17,868 --> 00:03:21,239
is the human ressources
for using the machines.

56
00:03:21,469 --> 00:03:23,852
Compared to the rural zones,
as you have seen

57
00:03:24,107 --> 00:03:26,520
the equipment in these zones
is used

58
00:03:26,976 --> 00:03:30,704
by personnel who is getting old
on one hand

59
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,187
and on the other hand who is
not well trained.

60
00:03:34,828 --> 00:03:40,238
So it would be best if we
did some training courses

61
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:43,659
to do so we would
need to bring them to the city,

62
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,920
to do short training programs
to use the equipment better

63
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:50,788
and be able to do exams
they don't know how to do

64
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:53,227
because they don't know
how to use the technology.

65
00:03:55,757 --> 00:03:57,925
We can't allow in our countries,

66
00:03:58,823 --> 00:04:00,287
high quality equipment

67
00:04:01,378 --> 00:04:03,735
equal to those in Europe

68
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,016
if we don't have locally based
personnel properly trained.

69
00:04:11,106 --> 00:04:13,540
When we have a project
for example to equip

70
00:04:13,727 --> 00:04:17,825
a hospital or a
medical imagery center,

71
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,588
we only think about the equipment,

72
00:04:22,738 --> 00:04:25,869
and not those who will use it,

73
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:30,866
and who will maintain it,

74
00:04:32,276 --> 00:04:35,294
and who will look after it

75
00:04:35,556 --> 00:04:38,707
for the maintenance
and daily running.
