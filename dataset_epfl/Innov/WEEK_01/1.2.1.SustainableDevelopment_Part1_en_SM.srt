1
00:00:12,626 --> 00:00:15,255
This lecture will focus on a major
global initiative

2
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:18,355
to reduce poverty and promote
sustainable development

3
00:00:18,555 --> 00:00:20,244
around the world.

4
00:00:20,444 --> 00:00:22,766
The United Nations defines
Sustainable Development 

5
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:25,425
as development that meets the needs
of the present

6
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:28,598
without compromising the ability
of future generations

7
00:00:28,798 --> 00:00:31,104
to meet their own needs.

8
00:00:31,304 --> 00:00:33,932
The current initiative
of Sustainable Development Goals

9
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:37,479
was preceded by a another somewhat
similar but smaller scale initiative

10
00:00:37,679 --> 00:00:41,531
that dates back to the beginning
of the current Millennium.

11
00:00:42,214 --> 00:00:45,357
In the year 2000, the leaders
of the world came together

12
00:00:45,557 --> 00:00:47,206
 and made a historic commitment:

13
00:00:47,406 --> 00:00:51,328
To eradicate extreme poverty
and improve the health and welfare

14
00:00:51,528 --> 00:00:53,997
of the world's poorest people
within 15 years.

15
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:56,994
The commitment was adopted at 
the Millennium Summit

16
00:00:57,194 --> 00:01:00,737
in September 2000, and it set forth
the United Nations

17
00:01:00,937 --> 00:01:04,536
Millenium Declaration, whose vision
was expressed

18
00:01:04,736 --> 00:01:07,126
in eight time-bound goals,
known as

19
00:01:07,326 --> 00:01:10,202
the Millennium Development
Goals or MDGs.

20
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:13,480
What exactly were these goals?

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:16,185
I will summarize them quickly.

22
00:01:16,385 --> 00:01:20,877
Goal 1 intended to eradicate
extreme poverty and hunger.

23
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:25,939
Goal 2: Achieve universal
primary education. 

24
00:01:27,043 --> 00:01:31,535
Goal 3: Promote gender equality
and empower women. 

25
00:01:31,735 --> 00:01:35,593
And Goal 4: Reduce child mortality.

26
00:01:36,118 --> 00:01:39,579
And Goal 5 to improve
maternal health.

27
00:01:39,779 --> 00:01:44,756
Goal 6: To combat HIV/AIDS,
malaria and other diseases.

28
00:01:45,266 --> 00:01:49,294
Goal 7: Ensure environmental
sustainability. 

29
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:53,831
Goal 8: Develop a global
partnership for development. 

30
00:01:54,827 --> 00:01:58,270
After 15 years, in 2015,
what did we achieve?

31
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:01,320
For Goal 1, extreme poverty
has declined

32
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,909
significantly over the last
2 decades.

33
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:06,951
In 1990, nearly half of
the population

34
00:02:07,151 --> 00:02:09,851
in the developing world
live in extreme poverty.

35
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:14,390
That proportion has now dropped
to 14 percent in 2015. 

36
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,869
And globally, the number of people
living in extreme poverty

37
00:02:18,069 --> 00:02:21,345
has declined by more than half,
falling from

38
00:02:21,545 --> 00:02:28,477
1.9 billion in 1990
to 836 million in 2015.

39
00:02:29,676 --> 00:02:33,611
And most progress had actually
occurred since 2000.

40
00:02:34,545 --> 00:02:37,572
And for Goal 2, the number
of out-of-school children

41
00:02:37,772 --> 00:02:43,056
of primary school age worldwide,
has fallen by almost half

42
00:02:43,256 --> 00:02:50,028
to an estimated 57 million in 2015,
down from 100 million in 2000.

43
00:02:50,228 --> 00:02:53,621
And Sub-Saharan Africa has had
the best record

44
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:56,294
of improvement in primary
education of any region

45
00:02:56,494 --> 00:02:59,078
since the MDGs were established. 

46
00:03:00,279 --> 00:03:03,080
And with respect to Goal 3,
today many more girls

47
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,357
are in school as compared
to 15 years ago.

48
00:03:05,557 --> 00:03:08,988
In Southern Asia, only 74 girls
were enrolled

49
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:13,082
in primary school for every
100 boys in 1990.

50
00:03:13,874 --> 00:03:17,108
But today we have 103 girls
that are enrolled

51
00:03:17,308 --> 00:03:20,015
for every 100 boys
in primary school.

52
00:03:20,893 --> 00:03:24,145
Not only that, but apparently
women have also gained ground

53
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:28,152
in parliamentary representation
in nearly 90 per cent

54
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:34,158
of the 174 countries monitored
over the past 20 years. 

55
00:03:34,948 --> 00:03:37,850
For Goal 4, despite
population growth

56
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,091
in the developing regions,
the global mortality rates

57
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:46,059
of children under 5 years old
has declined by more than half

58
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:52,049
dropping from 90 to 43 deaths
per 1000 live births

59
00:03:52,925 --> 00:03:56,138
between 1990 and 2015.

60
00:03:56,338 --> 00:03:59,749
In sub-Saharan Africa, the annual
rate of reduction

61
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,859
of mortality for children
under 5 years old

62
00:04:03,059 --> 00:04:09,024
was over 5 times faster
during 2005 to 2013

63
00:04:09,224 --> 00:04:13,858
than it was during the period
of 1990 to 1995.

64
00:04:14,816 --> 00:04:17,960
And for Goal 5, since 1990
the maternal mortality rate

65
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,270
has declined
by 45 per cent worldwide

66
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:24,115
and most of the reduction
has occurred since 2000.

67
00:04:24,315 --> 00:04:27,286
In southern Asia, the maternal
mortality rate 

68
00:04:27,486 --> 00:04:29,495
actually declined by 64 percent.

69
00:04:29,695 --> 00:04:33,458
And in Sub-Saharan Africa,
it fell by 49 percent.

70
00:04:34,736 --> 00:04:39,146
Goal 6: By June, 2014, almost
14 million people

71
00:04:39,346 --> 00:04:43,194
living with HIV, were receiving
antiretroviral therapy (ART) globally,

72
00:04:43,394 --> 00:04:47,734
which is an immense increase
from just 800,000 in 2003.

73
00:04:48,527 --> 00:04:51,970
And over 6 million malaria deaths 
have been averted

74
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:56,570
between 2000 and 2015,
and more importantly

75
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,367
this was primarily of children
under 5 years of age

76
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:03,155
in sub-Saharan Africa. 

77
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:06,769
And the global malaria incident
rate has fallen

78
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:11,075
by an estimated 37 percent,
while the mortality rate

79
00:05:11,275 --> 00:05:14,850
has declined by 50 per cent overall.

80
00:05:15,568 --> 00:05:19,244
Between the year 2000 and 2013,
anti-tuberculosis interventions

81
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:23,012
saved an estimated
37 million lives. 

82
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:28,272
Goal 7: Ozone-depleting substances

83
00:05:28,472 --> 00:05:30,771
have been virtually eliminated, 
and the ozone layer

84
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:33,724
is expected to recover
by the middle of this century.

85
00:05:34,457 --> 00:05:38,541
Globally, 147 countries have met
their drinking water targets

86
00:05:38,741 --> 00:05:43,281
while 95 countries have met
their sanitation targets. 

87
00:05:44,151 --> 00:05:50,093
And finally, for Goal 8, in 2014
79 percent of imports

88
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:52,855
from developing countries
to developed countries

89
00:05:53,055 --> 00:05:58,550
were admitted duty free,
which is up from 65 percent in 2000.

90
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:03,263
And the proportion of external
debt service to export revenue 

91
00:06:04,884 --> 00:06:10,592
in developing countries had fallen
by 400 percent in 2013.

92
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:16,158
So overall, the MDG initiative
was considered a success story!

93
00:06:16,930 --> 00:06:19,719
These successes are a great
source of encouragement,

94
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,821
and have served as
an engine or motor

95
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:24,408
to galvanize further
and continued action

96
00:06:24,608 --> 00:06:29,638
because despite these successes,
much still remains to be done,

97
00:06:29,838 --> 00:06:34,045
as those at the Bottom
of the Pyramid, i.e. the poorest

98
00:06:34,245 --> 00:06:38,656
and most vulnerable,
continue to be left behind.

99
00:06:39,448 --> 00:06:44,971
So, next time we will speak about
an even more ambitious initiative 

100
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:48,031
that intends to pick up where
the Millennium Development Goals

101
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:52,969
left off, and instead go much
further than before.

102
00:06:53,169 --> 00:06:54,379
Thank you.
