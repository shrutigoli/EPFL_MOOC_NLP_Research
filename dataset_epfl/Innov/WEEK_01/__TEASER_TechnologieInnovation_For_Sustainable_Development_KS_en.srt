00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:13,550
Hello. I’m Klaus Schönenberger

2
00:00:13,747 --> 00:00:15,847
and I am Solomzi Makohliso.

3
00:00:16,222 --> 00:00:17,322
Did you know that today

4
00:00:17,499 --> 00:00:19,311
2/3 of the world’s population

5
00:00:19,392 --> 00:00:20,530
have no access

6
00:00:20,702 --> 00:00:22,189
to medical diagnostic imaging

7
00:00:22,317 --> 00:00:24,917
despite its importance in health care?

8
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:26,420
It appears that solutions

9
00:00:26,569 --> 00:00:28,131
initially imagined for use

10
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:29,861
in industrialized countries

11
00:00:30,035 --> 00:00:31,760
can often not be replicated

12
00:00:31,938 --> 00:00:33,513
in low income countries.

13
00:00:34,116 --> 00:00:35,716
This is by no means unique

14
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:37,923
to the domain of medical devices.

15
00:00:38,808 --> 00:00:40,520
There are several other sectors

16
00:00:40,714 --> 00:00:42,139
where existing technologies

17
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:44,660
are often ill-adapted to the context

18
00:00:44,833 --> 00:00:46,833
such as pharmaceutical products,

19
00:00:46,976 --> 00:00:49,276
information and communication technologies,

20
00:00:49,449 --> 00:00:51,211
or technologies related to

21
00:00:51,361 --> 00:00:52,948
transport and construction.

22
00:00:55,213 --> 00:00:56,975
Water and sanitation technologies

23
00:00:57,152 --> 00:00:59,452
are also crucial, bearing in mind

24
00:00:59,599 --> 00:01:00,974
that more people have access

25
00:01:01,138 --> 00:01:01,850
to a cell phone

26
00:01:02,031 --> 00:01:03,881
than to a decent toilet.

27
00:01:04,919 --> 00:01:06,232
And finally, in a world

28
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:07,840
where 800 million people

29
00:01:08,014 --> 00:01:08,839
are undernourished,

30
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:10,785
food and agriculture technologies

31
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:13,161
are obviously equally crucial.

32
00:01:13,327 --> 00:01:15,077
Although technology does not provide

33
00:01:15,262 --> 00:01:16,949
a silver bullet against poverty,

34
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:18,695
it is a vital enabler

35
00:01:18,871 --> 00:01:19,971
of development.

36
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:21,849
But how can technology innovation

37
00:01:22,022 --> 00:01:24,322
bring about change and offer solutions

38
00:01:24,498 --> 00:01:25,898
that are truly adapted

39
00:01:26,078 --> 00:01:26,815
to the context

40
00:01:26,989 --> 00:01:28,689
and needs of the poor?

41
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:39,644
We invite you to join us

42
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:41,610
for this online course entitled,

43
00:01:41,775 --> 00:01:43,000
Technology Innovation

44
00:01:43,177 --> 00:01:44,902
for Sustainable Development.

45
00:01:45,547 --> 00:01:46,647
You will learn how you

46
00:01:46,815 --> 00:01:48,003
as an innovator

47
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,380
can help solve the important issues

48
00:01:50,563 --> 00:01:52,913
that burden those living in poverty.

49
00:01:53,089 --> 00:01:54,801
Through practical examples,

50
00:01:54,967 --> 00:01:56,342
we will demonstrate

51
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,135
how you can take your initiative

52
00:01:58,292 --> 00:02:00,254
from a blank sheet of paper

53
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:02,418
through to large scale deployment

54
00:02:02,583 --> 00:02:04,108
of the technology innovation.

55
00:02:04,815 --> 00:02:06,215
This course is not just about

56
00:02:06,383 --> 00:02:07,821
coming up with a nice idea

57
00:02:07,915 --> 00:02:09,640
or designing a nice prototype,

58
00:02:09,804 --> 00:02:10,916
but more importantly

59
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:12,276
about sustainably

60
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,411
deploying it at large scale.

61
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:15,570
It fosters

62
00:02:15,739 --> 00:02:17,339
an entrepreneurial approach

63
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,249
as you will learn

64
00:02:18,368 --> 00:02:19,868
how to design business models

65
00:02:20,031 --> 00:02:21,494
that are relevant to address

66
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,375
development related challenges.

67
00:02:23,546 --> 00:02:25,908
It encourages co-creating the solution

68
00:02:26,094 --> 00:02:27,919
with the key stakeholders involved

69
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:30,488
including the affected populations.

70
00:02:30,663 --> 00:02:32,051
Coming up with solutions

71
00:02:32,181 --> 00:02:33,368
that are more affordable

72
00:02:33,547 --> 00:02:34,372
and more durable

73
00:02:34,538 --> 00:02:36,625
that require less use of consumables

74
00:02:36,754 --> 00:02:37,604
and electricity

75
00:02:37,776 --> 00:02:39,826
while still being economically viable

76
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:41,184
concerns all of us

77
00:02:41,322 --> 00:02:42,397
and not just the people

78
00:02:42,522 --> 00:02:43,547
living in poverty.

79
00:02:43,716 --> 00:02:44,666
Whether you are

80
00:02:44,839 --> 00:02:45,964
from an industrialized

81
00:02:46,137 --> 00:02:47,575
or a developing country,

82
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:49,015
whether you are employed

83
00:02:49,163 --> 00:02:50,526
in a company, an NGO,

84
00:02:50,679 --> 00:02:51,979
an international organization

85
00:02:52,162 --> 00:02:52,787
or a government,

86
00:02:52,965 --> 00:02:53,990
whether you are

87
00:02:54,143 --> 00:02:55,456
an independent entrepreneur

88
00:02:55,594 --> 00:02:57,369
or simply a passionate individual.

89
00:02:57,559 --> 00:02:59,284
This course is for you.

90
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:01,055
It is free, it is open

91
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:02,160
and we look forward

92
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:03,480
to your participation

93
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:04,742
in bringing about

94
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:05,956
technology innovation

95
00:03:06,121 --> 00:03:08,596
for sustainable development.
