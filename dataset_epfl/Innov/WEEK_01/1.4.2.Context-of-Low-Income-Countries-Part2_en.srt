00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:15,538
Hello! In the last video,
we have seen three

2
00:00:15,638 --> 00:00:17,840
of the five main challenges
we have to face

3
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,959
when developing technology innovation
for low and middle income countries:

4
00:00:22,059 --> 00:00:25,456
a lack of quality infrastructure,
a lack of trained personnel,

5
00:00:25,556 --> 00:00:27,429
and a lack of financial resources.

6
00:00:27,726 --> 00:00:31,366
Let us now discuss the challenge
of harsh environment.

7
00:00:32,036 --> 00:00:34,750
This picture was taken
in a hospital in Cameroon.

8
00:00:34,850 --> 00:00:39,017
It shows the control panel
of a diagnostic ultrasound machine

9
00:00:39,117 --> 00:00:40,894
which has been severely damaged

10
00:00:40,994 --> 00:00:43,570
by warm and humid conditions
found there.

11
00:00:44,734 --> 00:00:47,661
This illustrates
the fundamental mismatch

12
00:00:47,761 --> 00:00:50,719
between the context
this device was designed for,

13
00:00:50,819 --> 00:00:53,183
and the actual context of use.

14
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,229
High temperatures and humidity
have a severe impact

15
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,570
on technologies which were developed
to work

16
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:03,060
in temperate 
and controlled environments

17
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:05,428
found in industrialized countries.

18
00:01:05,528 --> 00:01:09,751
In the tropics, temperatures can reach
27 degrees Celsius

19
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:12,532
with humidity above 95%.

20
00:01:12,632 --> 00:01:15,868
The effect of such environments
are numerous,

21
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:17,952
such as accelerated aging,

22
00:01:18,052 --> 00:01:20,907
changing in parameters
of electronic components,

23
00:01:21,007 --> 00:01:23,004
changing of material dimensions,

24
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:26,981
overheating of transformers
and electromechanical components

25
00:01:27,068 --> 00:01:30,373
and enclosures becoming distorted
and failing.

26
00:01:31,364 --> 00:01:35,334
High humidity will cause
corrosion and oxidation of metals,

27
00:01:35,434 --> 00:01:38,601
swelling of materials
due to water sorption,

28
00:01:38,701 --> 00:01:42,782
electrical short-circuits
and fogging of optical components.

29
00:01:43,512 --> 00:01:47,060
Heat and humidity combined
is an ideal environment

30
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:49,322
for fungus and microbial growth.

31
00:01:49,947 --> 00:01:52,662
Non-resistant materials
are susceptible

32
00:01:52,762 --> 00:01:56,276
to direct attack as the fungus
breaks the materials down

33
00:01:56,376 --> 00:01:58,396
and uses them as nutrients.

34
00:01:58,496 --> 00:02:03,689
Metabolic waste products excreted
by fungus cause corrosion of metals,

35
00:02:03,789 --> 00:02:06,789
etching of glass,
or staining or degrading

36
00:02:06,814 --> 00:02:08,833
of plastics and other materials.

37
00:02:09,936 --> 00:02:14,486
In arid areas, dust and sand
are pervasive enemies of technology.

38
00:02:14,586 --> 00:02:16,833
Dust may obstruct openings,

39
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:20,656
penetrate into cracks, crevices,
bearings and joints.

40
00:02:20,756 --> 00:02:22,275
It will clog filters

41
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,375
which leads to ventilation malfunction
and overheating.

42
00:02:25,852 --> 00:02:29,203
Sand and dust are
powerful agents of abrasion

43
00:02:29,303 --> 00:02:31,937
and will cause degradation
of electrical circuits

44
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:35,162
and interference and wear
of moving parts.

45
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,574
Solar light is a boon
in tropical countries

46
00:02:38,674 --> 00:02:41,645
as it represents
a wonderful source of clean energy.

47
00:02:41,745 --> 00:02:45,612
However, intense solar irradiation
takes a severe toll

48
00:02:45,712 --> 00:02:47,281
on equipment exposed to it.

49
00:02:47,891 --> 00:02:49,413
Effects can be thermal,

50
00:02:49,513 --> 00:02:53,251
with the sunlight heating up surfaces
in a directional way,

51
00:02:53,401 --> 00:02:56,000
which is different
from just ambient heat.

52
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:59,658
This may create destructive tensions
in materials.

53
00:03:00,321 --> 00:03:02,558
In addition to the heating effects,

54
00:03:02,655 --> 00:03:04,652
certain degradations
from solar energy

55
00:03:04,752 --> 00:03:08,117
may be attributable
to other portions of the spectrum,

56
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:10,331
particularly the ultraviolet.

57
00:03:10,924 --> 00:03:15,616
Deterioration of natural and synthetic
elastomers and polymers will result.

58
00:03:16,273 --> 00:03:19,072
There are many other
environmental problems

59
00:03:19,172 --> 00:03:22,172
such as the presence
of rodents or insects

60
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:25,562
which damage cables
and enclosures.

61
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:28,266
We should also mention
the issue of theft.

62
00:03:28,366 --> 00:03:30,550
Sometimes, even low value

63
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:34,054
and seemingly insignificant components
will be stolen,

64
00:03:34,154 --> 00:03:38,112
which can make equipment useless
with little possibility of repair.

65
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,885
Finally, it is not only important
to consider the environment

66
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:44,667
where the technology is being used

67
00:03:44,767 --> 00:03:47,410
but also the storage
and transport conditions.

68
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:50,335
If you are interested
in learning more

69
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:54,473
about these environmental conditions
and how the resilience of equipment

70
00:03:54,573 --> 00:03:57,845
is tested in these regards,
we recommend having a look

71
00:03:57,945 --> 00:04:01,776
at military norms,
known as MIL standards,

72
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:04,153
which can be downloaded
from the Internet.

73
00:04:05,207 --> 00:04:08,440
One of the most difficult
and frustrating challenges

74
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:12,689
is the one posed by the way
we humans make decisions,

75
00:04:12,789 --> 00:04:15,569
and by the way these decisions
are implemented.

76
00:04:16,188 --> 00:04:19,438
Broadly speaking, this is
the definition of governance.

77
00:04:19,845 --> 00:04:21,963
The next challenge
posed by the context

78
00:04:22,014 --> 00:04:24,808
that I would like to discuss
is bad governance.

79
00:04:25,645 --> 00:04:29,958
The concept of governance can apply
to public or private stakeholders.

80
00:04:30,058 --> 00:04:35,064
In the case of public institutions,
we can mention international governance,

81
00:04:35,444 --> 00:04:37,696
national governance
or local governance.

82
00:04:37,997 --> 00:04:40,241
For private institutions
like companies,

83
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:43,070
it is referred to
as corporate governance.

84
00:04:43,821 --> 00:04:47,993
Bad governance a
ffects many actors
across the society,

85
00:04:48,093 --> 00:04:53,104
such as landlords, NGOs, cooperatives,
unions, political parties,

86
00:04:53,204 --> 00:04:57,057
research institutes, corporations,
media, etcetera.

87
00:04:57,375 --> 00:04:59,015
It involves a wide variety

88
00:04:59,115 --> 00:05:01,442
of inappropriate
decision making processes,

89
00:05:01,542 --> 00:05:05,084
and/or inappropriate implementation
of these decisions.

90
00:05:05,259 --> 00:05:07,411
Specifically, bad governance

91
00:05:07,488 --> 00:05:09,996
may encourage 
or facilitate corruption

92
00:05:10,096 --> 00:05:11,247
which is defined as

93
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:14,502
"abuse of entrusted power
for private gain".

94
00:05:15,407 --> 00:05:17,527
Other effects 
of poor governance are:

95
00:05:17,627 --> 00:05:21,729
excessive administrative hassle,
also called "Red Tape",

96
00:05:21,767 --> 00:05:26,196
extortion, embezzlement, clientelism
to cite just a few.

97
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:29,336
It is only if we have
a solid collaboration

98
00:05:29,386 --> 00:05:31,431
with local stakeholders
in countries

99
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:35,762
that we will be able to understand
the subtle mechanisms at play

100
00:05:35,862 --> 00:05:38,722
in how decisions are made
and implemented.

101
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:41,455
They are heavily influenced
by history,

102
00:05:41,555 --> 00:05:44,779
culture, religion
and many other factors.

103
00:05:46,265 --> 00:05:48,622
We should, of course, remember
that bad governance

104
00:05:48,672 --> 00:05:50,531
can be found everywhere
on the planet,

105
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:52,719
not only in low
and middle income countries.

106
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,596
Let's have a look
at the specific case of corruption.

107
00:05:57,801 --> 00:06:01,040
This map shows
the corruption perception index,

108
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,743
which is defined
as the level of corruption

109
00:06:03,843 --> 00:06:06,755
perceived by people
living in the respective countries.

110
00:06:07,659 --> 00:06:08,706
The higher the score,

111
00:06:08,806 --> 00:06:10,750
the lower the perception
of corruption.

112
00:06:11,477 --> 00:06:13,937
The index is based
on opinion surveys

113
00:06:14,037 --> 00:06:16,740
and expert assessments
from a dozen institutions

114
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:21,768
such as the world bank, think tanks,
foundations and research organizations.

115
00:06:21,868 --> 00:06:25,937
This is actually representative
of how citizens of the countries

116
00:06:26,037 --> 00:06:27,585
perceive the situation

117
00:06:27,685 --> 00:06:31,488
and it is corroborated
by independent assessments.

118
00:06:31,588 --> 00:06:34,635
As you can see, the problem
is very widespread.

119
00:06:35,185 --> 00:06:37,989
In practice, this undermines society

120
00:06:38,089 --> 00:06:40,427
and prevents businesses
and individuals

121
00:06:40,527 --> 00:06:42,094
from being successful.

122
00:06:42,635 --> 00:06:43,898
In some countries,

123
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:48,031
it is so deeply rooted and pervasive
that every contact

124
00:06:48,131 --> 00:06:51,959
with government or civil society
will involve requests for bribes.

125
00:06:52,530 --> 00:06:54,836
Simply sending a product
through customs

126
00:06:54,936 --> 00:06:57,900
without paying bribes 
is often a major effort

127
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,441
which can take months.

128
00:06:59,873 --> 00:07:01,475
Here again, it is essential

129
00:07:01,579 --> 00:07:03,653
that we work together
with local actors

130
00:07:03,753 --> 00:07:06,059
so that we can understand
the problems.

131
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:07,714
We strongly believe

132
00:07:07,802 --> 00:07:10,522
that with perseverance
and a good understanding,

133
00:07:10,622 --> 00:07:13,685
it is possible to find
ethically correct solutions

134
00:07:13,785 --> 00:07:16,002
but this remains a big challenge.

135
00:07:16,722 --> 00:07:19,529
There is one more metric
which I would like to tell you about

136
00:07:19,629 --> 00:07:22,196
which is also closely related
to governance.

137
00:07:22,296 --> 00:07:24,558
It is called
the Ease of Doing Business index

138
00:07:24,658 --> 00:07:27,063
and it is very important
for entrepreneurs.

139
00:07:27,163 --> 00:07:32,313
The index is composed of sub-indices,
each measuring a specific dimension.

140
00:07:32,513 --> 00:07:34,868
It focuses in particular
on measuring

141
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:38,833
the effect of a country's laws,
regulations and processes

142
00:07:38,933 --> 00:07:41,726
on the ease of creating
and running a business.

143
00:07:41,826 --> 00:07:44,826
For example, it determines
how many days it takes

144
00:07:44,877 --> 00:07:48,181
to go through the legal
and administrative procedures

145
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:49,624
to start a business.

146
00:07:49,724 --> 00:07:53,319
It measures how difficult it is
to get the construction permits

147
00:07:53,419 --> 00:07:54,527
to build a warehouse,

148
00:07:54,627 --> 00:07:57,448
to get connected
to the electrical grid,

149
00:07:57,548 --> 00:08:01,557
or how burdensome it is
to register a real estate property right.

150
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:05,008
It evaluates how easy it is
to get credit,

151
00:08:05,108 --> 00:08:08,827
how well minority investors
are protected against lawsuits,

152
00:08:08,927 --> 00:08:11,931
how companies will be required
to pay taxes

153
00:08:12,031 --> 00:08:14,688
and how easy it is to trade
across borders.

154
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:20,394
Finally, it also includes an indicator
of how well contracts are enforced

155
00:08:20,494 --> 00:08:24,344
and how insolvency gets resolved
in case of bankruptcy.

156
00:08:24,644 --> 00:08:28,250
This complex set of parameters
is then aggregated

157
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,874
and countries are ranked

158
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:32,400
according to how well
they perform.

159
00:08:32,915 --> 00:08:35,218
Rather than showing you
yet another map,

160
00:08:35,318 --> 00:08:37,221
or some country rankings,

161
00:08:37,297 --> 00:08:40,051
we recommend that you go
to the World Bank's website

162
00:08:40,151 --> 00:08:44,988
to have a more detailed look
at how your country of interest is doing.

163
00:08:45,868 --> 00:08:48,088
I would like now to take
a little side step

164
00:08:48,288 --> 00:08:50,243
and talk about donations.

165
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:53,562
This video was filmed
in a small church

166
00:08:53,662 --> 00:08:57,300
adjacent to a rural district hospital
in Cameroon.

167
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,539
What you can see
is that the hospital

168
00:08:59,639 --> 00:09:01,820
had no more space to store

169
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,947
dysfunctional and obsolete
donated medical equipment.

170
00:09:05,549 --> 00:09:08,483
Donations epitomize
many of the challenges

171
00:09:08,683 --> 00:09:10,064
which we have just seen.

172
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:14,025
At first sight, it seems
that since low-income countries

173
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,774
can't afford to buy new equipment,
why would we not

174
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:19,162
recycle used equipment

175
00:09:19,262 --> 00:09:21,642
from industrialized countries
instead?

176
00:09:21,742 --> 00:09:26,305
Unfortunately, a very large majority
of donated equipment

177
00:09:26,405 --> 00:09:28,486
either never becomes functional
at all

178
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:31,710
or breaks down shortly
after having been delivered.

179
00:09:32,398 --> 00:09:34,461
According to the 
World Health Organization,

180
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:37,374
less than 30%
of donated medical equipment

181
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:38,714
is ever commissioned.

182
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,472
There are multiple reasons
for these failures

183
00:09:41,572 --> 00:09:43,328
which can, in general,
be attributed

184
00:09:43,428 --> 00:09:46,115
to a combination
of the main contextual challenges

185
00:09:46,215 --> 00:09:48,264
which are the topic
of this video.

186
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:51,827
Of course,
donations are critically important

187
00:09:51,927 --> 00:09:54,927
in humanitarian disasters
and many other situations.

188
00:09:55,644 --> 00:09:58,787
Donating complex equipment
such as medical devices

189
00:09:58,887 --> 00:10:01,095
can even be successful
and sustainable

190
00:10:01,195 --> 00:10:03,858
if a serious process is followed

191
00:10:03,958 --> 00:10:06,712
which involves
assessing the local situation

192
00:10:06,812 --> 00:10:09,372
and preparing the donation
in close collaboration

193
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:11,558
with the recipient organization.

194
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:14,956
Let us listen
to Mr. Andre Mama Fouda,

195
00:10:15,269 --> 00:10:18,344
Minister of Public Health
of the Republic of Cameroon,

196
00:10:18,444 --> 00:10:21,788
as he discusses the case
of medical equipment donations

197
00:10:21,842 --> 00:10:22,902
in his country.

198
00:10:23,406 --> 00:10:26,332
Indeed we receive

199
00:10:27,632 --> 00:10:28,120
donations

200
00:10:29,322 --> 00:10:30,243
coming from

201
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:34,672
partners from different countries

202
00:10:34,919 --> 00:10:37,806
and the difficulty is often

203
00:10:38,062 --> 00:10:41,324
the age of the given product.

204
00:10:41,792 --> 00:10:44,048
It's often devices
that have a certain age

205
00:10:44,566 --> 00:10:49,548
and which may not be
in the market anymore.

206
00:10:50,131 --> 00:10:52,958
This poses the problem
of spare parts

207
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:58,485
regardless of the productivity
of the device itself.

208
00:10:59,174 --> 00:11:00,011
Besides that,

209
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:02,144
with those donated devices

210
00:11:02,446 --> 00:11:04,834
we also have the problem of consumables,

211
00:11:05,429 --> 00:11:07,666
which are not always available

212
00:11:07,927 --> 00:11:10,092
and could be lacking,

213
00:11:10,787 --> 00:11:15,443
causing the users
to put aside the device.

214
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,268
Of course some devices need

215
00:11:19,489 --> 00:11:21,839
calibration and on-site adjustments.

216
00:11:22,902 --> 00:11:26,691
Often we don't have a technician 
that already knows that kind of device.

217
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,558
That's why I pay a lot of attention
to donations,

218
00:11:31,974 --> 00:11:34,974
especially when the donation is an
electronic device.

219
00:11:35,851 --> 00:11:39,247
As long as it's something mechanical

220
00:11:40,115 --> 00:11:42,105
we can find local solutions.

221
00:11:42,595 --> 00:11:44,934
But when there is a big 
electrical aspect,

222
00:11:47,397 --> 00:11:50,281
we need to be careful with 
those donations.

223
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:54,672
Our discussion
about contextual challenges

224
00:11:54,772 --> 00:11:55,949
would not be complete

225
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,716
if we did not mention
cultural aspects.

226
00:11:59,112 --> 00:12:02,934
On this picture, you can see
a lady in Cameroon

227
00:12:03,034 --> 00:12:06,013
who was sent to the hospital
by her traditional healer

228
00:12:06,113 --> 00:12:07,557
for a medical exam.

229
00:12:07,657 --> 00:12:10,153
The interaction
between traditional practices

230
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:13,779
and modern western medicine
is sometimes uneasy.

231
00:12:14,286 --> 00:12:17,789
Such cultural and traditional aspects
are very important

232
00:12:17,889 --> 00:12:20,525
and should be seriously considered
from the start.

233
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:23,431
Technology innovation will,
by definition,

234
00:12:23,531 --> 00:12:26,206
cause some disruptions
in the usual way

235
00:12:26,268 --> 00:12:27,731
things are being done.

236
00:12:27,931 --> 00:12:31,215
We need to be cognizant
of the cultural influences

237
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:35,290
and here again, there is no better way
than a close collaboration

238
00:12:35,732 --> 00:12:39,941
Of course, this does not mean
that we should design solutions

239
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:42,994
which are so specifically adapted
to a community

240
00:12:43,094 --> 00:12:45,820
that they lose any interest
for a wider public.

241
00:12:46,450 --> 00:12:50,282
We have to be able to step back
and think about how to broaden

242
00:12:50,382 --> 00:12:52,109
the impact of our technology.

243
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:56,886
Cultural differences offer
wonderful and fun learning experiences,

244
00:12:56,986 --> 00:12:59,740
but have the potential
to derail the best projects

245
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,738
if they are not deeply understood.

246
00:13:02,236 --> 00:13:05,859
The description of the context
of low and middle income countries

247
00:13:05,959 --> 00:13:09,289
we have just given may sound
negative and difficult.

248
00:13:10,024 --> 00:13:13,370
The challenges are real
but so are the upsides.

249
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,949
We are convinced
that success is possible

250
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:17,675
and there are many examples

251
00:13:17,775 --> 00:13:20,128
where entrepreneurs
have been able to succeed.

252
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:23,376
Getting there is exciting, fun
and instructive,

253
00:13:23,476 --> 00:13:26,103
and we strongly encourage you
to not be afraid

254
00:13:26,203 --> 00:13:27,341
by the challenges.

255
00:13:27,441 --> 00:13:28,528
Good bye.
