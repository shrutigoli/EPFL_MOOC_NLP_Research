1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:04,762
The topic of today's lecture is
Information and Communications Technologies

2
00:00:17,339 --> 00:00:20,189
What is Information and 
Communications Technology exactly?

3
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:21,440
or ICT?

4
00:00:22,134 --> 00:00:23,772
In very simple terms

5
00:00:23,947 --> 00:00:26,797
ICT refers to any device or system

6
00:00:26,997 --> 00:00:29,460
that allows the storage, retrieval

7
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:32,322
manipulation, transmission and receipt

8
00:00:32,447 --> 00:00:34,859
of information signals.

9
00:00:35,015 --> 00:00:37,852
Common examples include computers,

10
00:00:37,953 --> 00:00:40,528
television, telephones, radios

11
00:00:40,665 --> 00:00:42,165
and several others,

12
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,270
as the list keeps growing everyday.

13
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:48,869
ICT devices are today indispensable

14
00:00:48,992 --> 00:00:50,530
in our daily lives.

15
00:00:51,603 --> 00:00:54,053
And the concepts, 
methods and applications

16
00:00:54,147 --> 00:00:57,147
involved in ICT are constantly evolving

17
00:00:57,245 --> 00:01:00,683
on an almost daily basis.

18
00:01:01,558 --> 00:01:05,583
In 2016, 3.9 billion people

19
00:01:05,724 --> 00:01:08,736
or about 53% of the world’s population

20
00:01:08,852 --> 00:01:11,727
is not using the Internet.

21
00:01:11,866 --> 00:01:13,916
If we break it down by regions,

22
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:19,154
we see that almost 75% of people
in Africa are offline

23
00:01:19,296 --> 00:01:22,709
while only 21% of Europeans are offline.

24
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:27,796
In the Middle East and Asia and the
Pacific and the Arab States

25
00:01:27,969 --> 00:01:29,644
the percentage of the population

26
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:33,044
that is not using the Internet today
is about 58%.

27
00:01:34,555 --> 00:01:36,605
The gender gap in global Internet
usage

28
00:01:36,794 --> 00:01:41,406
grew from 11% in 2013 to 12%
in 2016.

29
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:44,076
The gap remains largest in the

30
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:47,823
world’s Least Developed Countries 
at 31%.

31
00:01:49,396 --> 00:01:54,821
In 2016, the regional gender gap is 
largest in Africa

32
00:01:54,888 --> 00:01:59,850
at 23%, and smallest in 
the Americas at 2%.

33
00:02:01,349 --> 00:02:03,724
In general, globally we see that

34
00:02:03,849 --> 00:02:07,486
the average price of a basic
fixed-broadband plan

35
00:02:08,341 --> 00:02:09,679
is more than twice as high

36
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,738
as the average price of a comparable
 mobile broadband plan.

37
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:18,734
But, paradoxically, mobile 
broadband prices

38
00:02:18,902 --> 00:02:21,165
are about 2.5 times higher

39
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:25,580
in least-developed-countries
 than developed countries.

40
00:02:26,142 --> 00:02:28,242
In developed countries, over 75%

41
00:02:28,364 --> 00:02:30,476
of fixed-broadband subscriptions offer

42
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:34,137
speeds of 10 Mbit/s and above.

43
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:39,910
While In the LDCs, only 7%
of fixed-broadband subscriptions

44
00:02:40,222 --> 00:02:42,310
offer similar funds.

45
00:02:42,935 --> 00:02:44,123
We saw the paradox

46
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:45,387
in the previous slide

47
00:02:45,544 --> 00:02:49,144
where the poorest countries still paying
outrageously higher prices

48
00:02:49,242 --> 00:02:51,405
for broadband services.

49
00:02:51,515 --> 00:02:53,128
Why is that?

50
00:02:53,222 --> 00:02:55,822
There are many factors, of course, at play.

51
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:58,123
But one of them is that
most African countries

52
00:02:58,292 --> 00:03:00,779
installed their first internet Gateway

53
00:03:00,932 --> 00:03:03,107
through satellite links.

54
00:03:03,245 --> 00:03:05,157
This made Africa rely on satellites

55
00:03:05,254 --> 00:03:08,067
and Very Small Aperture
Terminal (VSAT) earth stations

56
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:10,817
for most of its connectivity,

57
00:03:10,927 --> 00:03:13,064
which resulted in high prices

58
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:14,757
and slow performances

59
00:03:14,862 --> 00:03:18,000
as compared to other technologies.

60
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:22,660
However, there are several 
multi-country projects

61
00:03:22,735 --> 00:03:25,573
initiated to lay down undersea

62
00:03:25,665 --> 00:03:28,565
fibre optic cables around Africa,

63
00:03:28,721 --> 00:03:33,871
linking it with the Middle East,
Europe and beyond.

64
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:36,694
The use of fibre optic technology is

65
00:03:36,794 --> 00:03:39,794
expected to significantly 
boost bandwidth capacity

66
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:43,055
of the African closest to the cables.

67
00:03:43,878 --> 00:03:46,728
A submarine communications cable

68
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:51,661
is a cable laid on the sea bed 
between land-based stations

69
00:03:52,328 --> 00:03:55,753
to carry telecommunication
signals across stretches of ocean.

70
00:03:56,503 --> 00:03:59,441
Modern cables use optical
fiber technology

71
00:03:59,582 --> 00:04:01,644
to carry digital data,

72
00:04:01,738 --> 00:04:05,638
which includes telephones, Internet,

73
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:08,736
and private data traffic.

74
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:13,361
And with respect to potential
impact on surrounding environment,

75
00:04:14,177 --> 00:04:16,277
previous studies have indicated

76
00:04:16,414 --> 00:04:20,401
that cables actually can pose minimal
 impacts on life in these environments.

77
00:04:21,438 --> 00:04:24,438
And as you can see on the map
on the screen

78
00:04:25,113 --> 00:04:26,963
the diagram is very busy

79
00:04:27,118 --> 00:04:30,118
and we will not take the time to
 describe it fully

80
00:04:30,559 --> 00:04:33,034
but I invite you to examine in

81
00:04:33,145 --> 00:04:36,145
more detail after the lecture

82
00:04:36,284 --> 00:04:39,284
and the related references 
that are listed

83
00:04:40,277 --> 00:04:45,039
But briefly, some of the first 
submarine cable projects

84
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:48,948
include Seacom on the East Coast,

85
00:04:49,018 --> 00:04:54,181
EASSy, which stands for Eastern
Africa Submarine Cable System,

86
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,230
and WACS for West Africa Cable System.

87
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:01,297
The Chinese company, Huawei Marine,

88
00:05:01,755 --> 00:05:04,318
announced earlier 
that it had completed

89
00:05:04,414 --> 00:05:08,014
upgrades on 
the West Africa Cable System (WACS)

90
00:05:08,197 --> 00:05:11,197
which is the largest submarine cable

91
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,469
directly linking Africa to Europe

92
00:05:13,579 --> 00:05:16,579
using a 100G transmission solution

93
00:05:16,689 --> 00:05:21,801
that will enhance network connectivity
 and operational efficiency.

94
00:05:22,202 --> 00:05:24,339
In a similar vein, Huawei Marine

95
00:05:24,413 --> 00:05:34,063
has commenced marine installation of
the Nigeria-Cameroon Submarine Cable System (NCSCS),

96
00:05:34,265 --> 00:05:37,978
which is Cameroon's first wholly 
owned submarine cable,

97
00:05:38,275 --> 00:05:41,275
with investment provided by
the Cameroon Government.

98
00:05:42,931 --> 00:05:46,706
The cable, which spans 
approximately 1,100 km,

99
00:05:46,869 --> 00:05:50,419
will link Cameroon directly with
Nigeria

100
00:05:50,513 --> 00:05:54,488
delivering 12.8 Tbps

101
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:57,610
of capacity to broadband users
in both countries

102
00:05:58,384 --> 00:06:02,847
And according to the head of Cameroon
Telecommunications Corporation

103
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:07,574
the direct connection to Nigeria 
will enhance Cameroon's position

104
00:06:07,737 --> 00:06:09,512
as the major hub of bandwidth

105
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:12,373
in the region and internationally,

106
00:06:12,474 --> 00:06:15,474
to Europe and beyond.

107
00:06:15,894 --> 00:06:18,781
In the sessions of Essential
Technologies for Health and Energy

108
00:06:19,007 --> 00:06:21,857
we saw already the power
 of mobile telephony

109
00:06:21,968 --> 00:06:23,318
towards some of the challenges

110
00:06:23,497 --> 00:06:26,997
in those sectors
 in developing countries, especially.

111
00:06:27,813 --> 00:06:29,313
Perhaps the area where many believe

112
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:32,804
that mobile communications 
technology will have

113
00:06:32,884 --> 00:06:37,572
a truly transformative impact
is Digital Finance.

114
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:44,618
Now, according to a new report
from the McKinsey Global Institute

115
00:06:45,163 --> 00:06:47,951
digital finance could be 
a powerful tool

116
00:06:48,025 --> 00:06:51,025
for driving inclusive growth
in emerging economies.

117
00:06:52,698 --> 00:06:55,761
The report states that widespread
 adoption

118
00:06:55,913 --> 00:06:58,450
and use of digital finance

119
00:06:58,532 --> 00:07:01,857
could increase the GDPs of
 all emerging economies

120
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,191
by 6 percent

121
00:07:03,403 --> 00:07:10,303
or a total
of $3.7 trillion, by 2025.

122
00:07:10,795 --> 00:07:13,382
Digital finance
could provide access

123
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:16,470
to 1.6 billion unbanked people,

124
00:07:16,514 --> 00:07:19,102
of which more than half 
would be women.

125
00:07:19,249 --> 00:07:23,136
And an additional $2.1 trillion
 of loans

126
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:26,069
to individuals and small businesses

127
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:28,267
could be made sustainably,

128
00:07:28,359 --> 00:07:32,484
as providers gain newfound ability
 to assess credit risk

129
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:35,393
for a wider pool of borrowers.

130
00:07:35,847 --> 00:07:38,022
One of the pioneers and most successful

131
00:07:38,204 --> 00:07:40,391
digital finance platforms to date

132
00:07:40,489 --> 00:07:43,014
is M-Pesa.

133
00:07:43,177 --> 00:07:44,415
Where M stands for mobile,

134
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:47,245
and pesa is Swahili for money.

135
00:07:48,932 --> 00:07:53,407
M-Pesa is basically a mobile 
phone-based money transfer,

136
00:07:53,492 --> 00:07:56,442
financing and microfinancing service,

137
00:07:56,574 --> 00:07:59,237
launched in 2007

138
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:03,485
by some of the largest mobile
network operators

139
00:08:03,621 --> 00:08:06,596
in Kenya and Tanzania.

140
00:08:06,699 --> 00:08:11,224
It has since expanded to Afghanistan,
South Africa,

141
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:15,111
India, Romania and Albania.

142
00:08:16,811 --> 00:08:21,298
M-Pesa allows users to deposit,
withdraw,

143
00:08:21,622 --> 00:08:24,947
transfer money and pay 
for goods and services

144
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:28,296
with ease using a mobile device.

145
00:08:28,484 --> 00:08:31,022
The service allows users to 
deposit money into an account

146
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:33,580
stored on their cell phones,

147
00:08:33,675 --> 00:08:38,187
to send balances using PIN-secured
SMS text messages

148
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:44,143
to other users, including sellers 
of goods and services,

149
00:08:44,289 --> 00:08:48,351
and to redeem deposits 
for regular money.

150
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,452
Users are charged a small fee
for sending

151
00:08:52,517 --> 00:08:56,455
and withdrawing money
using the service.

152
00:08:58,492 --> 00:09:00,029
The service has been lauded

153
00:09:00,145 --> 00:09:02,483
for giving millions
 of people access

154
00:09:02,579 --> 00:09:04,692
to the formal financial system

155
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:07,157
and for reducing crime

156
00:09:07,297 --> 00:09:10,297
in an otherwise largely cash-based
society.

157
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,121
That brings us to the end of

158
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,187
this lecture

159
00:09:16,877 --> 00:09:18,165
Goodbye!
