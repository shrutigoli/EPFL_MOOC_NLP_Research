1
00:00:20,837 --> 00:00:21,350
Hello.

2
00:00:21,550 --> 00:00:24,742
Today, according to the United 
Nations Food and Agricultural

3
00:00:24,942 --> 00:00:29,026
Organization, about 1/3 of all food produced
for human consumption is lost or

4
00:00:29,226 --> 00:00:34,828
wasted. At the same time almost 800
million people in the world haven't

5
00:00:35,028 --> 00:00:39,265
got enough food to lead a healthy
active life. According to current

6
00:00:39,465 --> 00:00:45,823
estimates the human population will 
grow from 7.2 billion today to 9 billion in

7
00:00:46,023 --> 00:00:49,890
2040. And this increasing population
will need to be fed. 

8
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:55,636
200 years ago British economist 
Thomas Malthus had predicted that

9
00:00:55,836 --> 00:01:01,119
population growth would be limited 
by our ability to produce enough food.

10
00:01:01,319 --> 00:01:04,794
This prediction turned out to be 
partially wrong so far due to the

11
00:01:04,994 --> 00:01:08,965
invention of chemical fertilizers
and a variety of other technologies,

12
00:01:09,165 --> 00:01:13,485
which allow to radically increase
agricultural yield. However, 

13
00:01:13,685 --> 00:01:16,841
the Malthusian challenge didn't go
away completely. 

14
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:20,271
And a global food security remains
a challenge. 

15
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:24,789
However, this is only one side of
the problem. Industrial era

16
00:01:24,989 --> 00:01:29,576
agriculture involving intensive use
of pesticides and fertilizers

17
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:33,690
as well as deforestation have a
severe impact on climate and the

18
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:38,343
environment. The paradox is that
these technologies, while they

19
00:01:38,543 --> 00:01:43,100
increase immediate agricultural 
output, also tend to jeopardize

20
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,628
the future capacity 
to generate food.

21
00:01:45,828 --> 00:01:50,375
Sustainable agriculture requires
innovative solutions to improve

22
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:54,896
efficacy while preserving the assets
for future production, for example, 

23
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:59,568
by minimizing loss of soils, loss of
biodiversity or pollution of water

24
00:01:59,768 --> 00:02:04,843
and air. Yet another important fact
is that agriculture is the single

25
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:09,550
largest employer in the world,
providing livelihoods for 40 %

26
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:14,764
of today's global population. As a
consequence, the link with economic

27
00:02:14,964 --> 00:02:19,109
developmental poverty is obvious.
In order to understand the influence

28
00:02:19,309 --> 00:02:23,901
of technology in this field we need
to explain the food value chain

29
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:24,895
framework. 

30
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:29,109
But before we get there, let me give
you some important definitions.

31
00:02:29,309 --> 00:02:33,820
Inadequate nutrition in general is
called malnutrition. 

32
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:38,144
It is a pervasive problem as around
40 % of the world's population is

33
00:02:38,344 --> 00:02:41,065
malnourished in one way or another.

34
00:02:41,265 --> 00:02:45,208
Ending malnutrition is our
sustainable goal #2.

35
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:49,143
Malnutrition comes in 3 different
manifestations. 

36
00:02:49,343 --> 00:02:54,013
First, we have undernourishment,
which is insufficient access to

37
00:02:54,213 --> 00:02:58,069
calories and proteins. It is also
called chronic hunger.

38
00:02:58,269 --> 00:03:03,351
Effects of undernourishment include
stunting and wasting in children. 

39
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:08,786
Stunting is when children are shorter
than they should be due to food

40
00:03:08,986 --> 00:03:13,454
deprivation. Wasting is when the
child's weight is too low for their

41
00:03:13,654 --> 00:03:14,046
height.

42
00:03:14,246 --> 00:03:18,677
The second manifestation is
micronutrient deficiency. 

43
00:03:18,877 --> 00:03:21,605
Which is sometimes called 
hidden hunger.

44
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:26,497
It is a condition arising when calories and 
proteins may be sufficient, but where

45
00:03:26,697 --> 00:03:31,092
essential micronutrients, such as
vitamin A, Iron or Iodine

46
00:03:31,292 --> 00:03:32,069
 are missing.

47
00:03:32,269 --> 00:03:36,474
Finally, obesity is a condition
affecting not only the rich countries,

48
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:39,671
but also increasingly people in
developing countries as a 

49
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:43,256
consequence of the poor moving to
urban areas and adopting more

50
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:45,000
sedentary lifestyles.

51
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,713
Now, let us look in more details at
the food value chain, in order to

52
00:03:49,913 --> 00:03:53,377
understand where technologies could
be put to use for reducing

53
00:03:53,577 --> 00:03:54,715
malnutrition. 

54
00:03:54,899 --> 00:03:58,804
The value chain is shown here. It
starts at the bottom with producers,

55
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:03,229
who can be farmers or grow crops,
or cattle. Or fishermen who exploit

56
00:04:03,429 --> 00:04:08,088
the sea or lakes. These producers
need inputs such as tools, 

57
00:04:08,288 --> 00:04:12,566
machinery, fertilizers, and seeds to
be able to grow their product.

58
00:04:12,766 --> 00:04:16,688
For example, recent technologies
have allowed to make seeds resistant

59
00:04:16,888 --> 00:04:21,111
to pests or drought. Which is a
great advantage in an industry

60
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:25,884
that is very exposed to such threats.
However, the cost of those seeds

61
00:04:26,084 --> 00:04:30,438
is also a growing financial burden
for small farmers who have no real

62
00:04:30,638 --> 00:04:34,303
alternative, but to purchase them
annually. There are, of course,

63
00:04:34,503 --> 00:04:38,363
legitimate ethical concerns about
genetic manipulation of crops

64
00:04:38,563 --> 00:04:42,240
or cattle, which we don't want to
discuss here. 

65
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:47,159
As I have mentioned, fertilizers,
and pesticides have had a huge

66
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:50,996
effect on the productivity. And have
been a cornerstone of the green

67
00:04:51,196 --> 00:04:55,562
revolution in the 20th century.
Unfortunately, these technologies

68
00:04:55,762 --> 00:04:59,144
also come with a downside. Which
is their negative impact on

69
00:04:59,344 --> 00:05:03,725
ecosystems and biodiversity. For
example, through the increasing

70
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:09,285
use of Nitrogen fertilizer, Nitrous
Oxide, which is a greenhouse gas that is

71
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:13,887
released and contributes heavily
to global warming. 

72
00:05:14,087 --> 00:05:18,270
Producers use a variety of other
important technologies, such as

73
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:22,676
harvesting machines, and irrigation
technologies. We will discuss one of

74
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:24,618
these later in this video. 

75
00:05:24,818 --> 00:05:29,934
Yet, another domain is related
to veterinarian technology such as

76
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:35,059
vaccines and various drugs which are
also very important to maintain the

77
00:05:35,259 --> 00:05:37,744
livestock healthy and productive. 

78
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:41,981
The next step is aggregation. 
According United Nations, there are

79
00:05:42,181 --> 00:05:47,349
500 million small farms worldwide.
Which provide up to 80% of the food

80
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:50,784
consumed in a large part of the 
developing world.

81
00:05:50,984 --> 00:05:55,066
The produce of those small farms
is either consumed directly, or

82
00:05:55,266 --> 00:05:59,078
sold on markets or to
aggregators.

83
00:05:59,278 --> 00:06:03,344
The high fragmentation and dispersion
of small holder producers makes the

84
00:06:03,544 --> 00:06:07,259
aggregation step especially 
challenging in developing countries.

85
00:06:07,459 --> 00:06:12,113
The aggregation function can be 
taken on by producer groups such as

86
00:06:12,313 --> 00:06:16,288
cooperatives, by intermediaries
specialized in aggregation, or by

87
00:06:16,488 --> 00:06:21,293
food processors themselves. At this
stage technologies related to

88
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:25,445
adequately packaging, transporting
and storing the food are especially

89
00:06:25,645 --> 00:06:26,385
important. 

90
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:30,716
Processors are involved in both the
preparation of fresh food as well as

91
00:06:30,916 --> 00:06:36,165
prepared food. Such food processing
is composed of a variety of companies, which

92
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:40,245
process products at different
stages. For example, slaughtering 

93
00:06:40,445 --> 00:06:44,644
and meat processing, fruit and
vegetable preservation, grain and

94
00:06:44,844 --> 00:06:49,333
oil seed milling, seafood product
preparation, sugar and confectionary

95
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:52,864
bakery, dairy and other food product
manufacturing. 

96
00:06:53,064 --> 00:06:56,952
Each of these will use specific
technologies, such as milling

97
00:06:57,152 --> 00:07:00,687
machines, cooking ovens, presses
and so forth.

98
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:05,032
For food processors, food quality is
crucial and any failure in these

99
00:07:05,232 --> 00:07:07,705
regards will have severe 
consequences.

100
00:07:07,905 --> 00:07:11,663
There's a variety of technologies
which allow to assess food quality

101
00:07:11,863 --> 00:07:15,226
and monitor safety all along the
complete value chain.

102
00:07:15,426 --> 00:07:20,488
Food preservation methods and
technologies are also very important

103
00:07:20,688 --> 00:07:24,959
for processors. These sometimes 
involve chemical compounds which may

104
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:28,518
have a negative impact on consumer
health. 

105
00:07:28,718 --> 00:07:32,358
Sustainable product packaging
is a challenge which is intimately

106
00:07:32,558 --> 00:07:36,645
connected to the generation of waste
and product conservation, of course.

107
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:42,417
The level of food waste in this
processing step is more than 30%

108
00:07:42,617 --> 00:07:46,942
and thus any new technology which
can reduce it is essential.

109
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:51,767
Distribution is usually assured by
wholesalers and retailers. 

110
00:07:51,967 --> 00:07:56,582
This is a highly competitive 
industry in both mature and

111
00:07:56,782 --> 00:07:58,105
developing markets.

112
00:07:58,305 --> 00:08:03,436
Quality, especially of fresh food,
plays a key role in consumer choice. 

113
00:08:03,636 --> 00:08:08,213
Distributors are thus extremely
sensitive to this aspect of quality

114
00:08:08,413 --> 00:08:10,260
and the look of the product. 

115
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,804
Stock management solutions and
technologies are especially

116
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:19,013
important here, in order to minimize
surplus or out of stock situations.

117
00:08:19,213 --> 00:08:23,011
For example, active product labels
based on regular frequency

118
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:26,735
identification or simply
barcodes are of key importance.

119
00:08:26,935 --> 00:08:30,955
Not only for stock management, but
also for product traceability. 

120
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:35,228
Packaging is also of utmost
importance, as it has been shown

121
00:08:35,428 --> 00:08:39,215
to have a large influence on purchase
decision by customers. 

122
00:08:39,415 --> 00:08:42,670
Unfortunately, packaging is also
a great contributor to the waste

123
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,620
generation, which brings us back to
the sustainability and environmental

124
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:50,560
issues already mentioned. One should
also mention some recent

125
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:54,696
technological progress whereby
consumers can now order food through

126
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:58,809
the internet. Some retailers are
even considering drones for

127
00:08:59,009 --> 00:09:01,811
for delivering the products to 
their customers.

128
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:05,049
At the end of the day, we as 
consumers have a huge influence

129
00:09:05,249 --> 00:09:09,844
on the whole chain. And our purchase
decisions influence which technologies

130
00:09:10,044 --> 00:09:13,450
can or cannot be proposed as 
the part of the value chain.

131
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,011
Now that we have seen the food
value chain, let us have a look at

132
00:09:17,211 --> 00:09:21,994
how efficient it is currently at
providing global access to food

133
00:09:22,194 --> 00:09:23,564
for everyone. 

134
00:09:23,764 --> 00:09:27,549
Sadly, as we can see on this map,
there's a great problem with global

135
00:09:27,749 --> 00:09:32,469
malnutrition. Strangely, as it might
appear, often times it is not

136
00:09:32,669 --> 00:09:35,944
so much the quantity of food 
produced which is the problem, but

137
00:09:36,144 --> 00:09:40,007
rather the access to it. Take, for
example, the well-known link

138
00:09:40,207 --> 00:09:44,129
between war and famine. Conflict
is a feature of many famines

139
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:48,191
worldwide. It prevents access to
food and causes long term

140
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:51,309
devastation of vital agricultural
assets.

141
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:55,747
It is also quite evident from this
map that there's a link between

142
00:09:55,947 --> 00:10:00,155
hunger and politics. Under 
dictatorial regimes the countries

143
00:10:00,355 --> 00:10:04,769
tend to fall into protracted hunger
crises as a consequence of corruption,

144
00:10:04,969 --> 00:10:09,239
lack of accountability, mismanagement
and international isolation.

145
00:10:09,439 --> 00:10:14,750
It is today widely accepted that all
contemporary famines are political.

146
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:18,003
This, of course, shall not discourage
us from trying to come up

147
00:10:18,203 --> 00:10:21,418
with more efficient and more 
sustainable food and agriculture

148
00:10:21,618 --> 00:10:26,134
technologies. The good news is that
undernourishment has fallen globally

149
00:10:26,334 --> 00:10:31,174
in the last two decades. By contrast,
however, micronutrient deficiency

150
00:10:31,374 --> 00:10:35,375
has not fallen at all. Today about 2
billion people suffer from

151
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:39,815
micronutrient deficiency. As we can
see, there's a great need for new

152
00:10:40,015 --> 00:10:43,628
solutions to fight malnutrition
while preserving the planet.

153
00:10:43,828 --> 00:10:46,625
Let us look at one such innovative
technology.

154
00:10:46,825 --> 00:10:53,038
There is a project called
Info 4 Dourou 2.0 which aims to help

155
00:10:53,238 --> 00:10:57,739
small farmers to secure crops and
improve irrigation in dry areas.

156
00:10:57,939 --> 00:11:02,424
The project involves measuring the
soil humidity, temperature and other

157
00:11:02,624 --> 00:11:08,390
climatic parameters. The technology
then gives the farmer realtime information

158
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,703
via an alarm sent by text messaging
concerning the need for irrigation.

159
00:11:12,903 --> 00:11:16,889
This helps to make sure that plants
get water at the exact moment when

160
00:11:17,089 --> 00:11:21,746
it's needed. The technology improves
the chances of having a successful

161
00:11:21,946 --> 00:11:24,326
harvest, which is vital for the 
farmer. 

162
00:11:24,526 --> 00:11:28,490
It provides also an important 
contribution to sustainable water

163
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:31,499
use, as it avoids useless watering.

164
00:11:31,699 --> 00:11:36,493
A series of successful experiments
were conducted in Burkina Faso.

165
00:11:36,693 --> 00:11:40,770
In one case, it was shown that the
crop yield was improved by up to

166
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:46,480
37%, while the water consumption
was reduced by as much as 20%.

167
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,908
The system developed at EPFL's
cooperation and development center

168
00:11:51,108 --> 00:11:56,366
is solar powered and has a rugged
design. It is intended as a solution

169
00:11:56,566 --> 00:11:59,890
for cooperatives and 
individual farms.

170
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:03,887
Currently, the technology is being
transferred to the local private sector.

171
00:12:04,087 --> 00:12:07,903
In particular, local manufacturing
solutions will be implemented to

172
00:12:08,103 --> 00:12:11,611
reduce costs and to provide 
sustainable access to the technology

173
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:13,107
for local producers. 

174
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:18,316
We hope that you will now have 
plenty of new project ideas in

175
00:12:18,516 --> 00:12:21,170
this very important essential
technology domain.

176
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:23,542
Goodbye.
