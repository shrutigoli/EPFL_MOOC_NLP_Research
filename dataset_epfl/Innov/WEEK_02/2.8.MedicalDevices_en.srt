1
00:00:18,072 --> 00:00:21,309
Hello. The little girl we just saw
had an x-ray taken

2
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:23,805
in a large hospital
in Cameroon.

3
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:26,961
Perhaps have you noticed that
she had to climb on a stool

4
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,583
to be at the right height in front
of the x-ray imaging detector?

5
00:00:31,025 --> 00:00:34,413
The reason was that the electrical
motors allowing to position

6
00:00:34,636 --> 00:00:36,999
the height of the
detector had failed.

7
00:00:37,306 --> 00:00:41,356
The hospital does not have
the resources to have it fixed.

8
00:00:41,755 --> 00:00:44,667
This story illustrates a
great problem in hospitals

9
00:00:44,907 --> 00:00:46,932
in low and middle
income countries:

10
00:00:47,136 --> 00:00:51,273
the lack of proper access to
essential medical devices.

11
00:00:51,497 --> 00:00:54,210
Medical devices are really
an essential technology

12
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,694
in the sense
of our MOOC.

13
00:00:56,963 --> 00:01:00,201
Let me now define this
category a little better.

14
00:01:00,645 --> 00:01:02,845
According to the
World Health Organization

15
00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:06,054
there are over 10 000
types of medical devices.

16
00:01:06,465 --> 00:01:10,852
They range from the simplest 
tongue depressor or thermometer

17
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:13,949
to the most complex
nuclear medicine machine.

18
00:01:14,169 --> 00:01:17,169
It is not easy to give a
general definition

19
00:01:17,434 --> 00:01:21,009
of what is or is not
a medical device.

20
00:01:21,228 --> 00:01:25,628
Basically it is an article,
instrument, apparatus or machine

21
00:01:25,849 --> 00:01:29,012
that is used in the prevention,
diagnosis or treatment of

22
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:32,443
illness or disease or for
detecting, measuring,

23
00:01:32,654 --> 00:01:37,729
restoring, correcting or modifying
the structure or function of the body

24
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,210
for some health purpose. Typically,
the purpose of a medical device

25
00:01:42,457 --> 00:01:47,882
is not achieved by pharmacological,
immunological or metabolic means.

26
00:01:48,422 --> 00:01:51,847
This is the World Health
Organization's summarized

27
00:01:52,048 --> 00:01:56,748
definition of medical devices
as there is actually a longer one.

28
00:01:57,176 --> 00:02:00,851
This definition shows how vast
the domain is.

29
00:02:01,183 --> 00:02:04,208
In order to understand
the importance of medical devices

30
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:09,752
we must try to better understand how
they fit into health care processes,

31
00:02:09,988 --> 00:02:13,313
and in particular
into health systems.

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Let us take a step back and
consider the outcomes of

33
00:02:16,881 --> 00:02:20,719
an important international
conference which took place in 1978

34
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:26,102
in the city of Almaty in Kazakhstan
or Alma Ata as it was then called.

35
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:30,111
This conference stressed health
as a basic human right

36
00:02:30,357 --> 00:02:33,782
and called all of the World Health
Organization's member states

37
00:02:33,997 --> 00:02:38,447
to urgent action to reach
health for all by the year 2000.

38
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:40,893
This goal has obviously
not been met.

39
00:02:41,114 --> 00:02:44,977
However the conference delivered
another very important message.

40
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,420
It stressed the key role
of primary health care,

41
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,627
particularly
in developing countries.

42
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:56,552
The famous Alma Ata Declaration
which resulted from the conference

43
00:02:56,785 --> 00:03:00,198
includes a series of
very important principles

44
00:03:00,417 --> 00:03:05,055
which are still highly pertinent to
the organization of health care today.

45
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:09,252
In particular, it defines primary 
health care as :

46
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:14,143
"Essential health care based on
practical, scientifically sound

47
00:03:14,392 --> 00:03:18,692
and socially acceptable methods
and technology made universally

48
00:03:18,951 --> 00:03:23,613
accessible to individuals
and families in the community

49
00:03:23,846 --> 00:03:27,008
through their full participation
and at a cost that

50
00:03:27,243 --> 00:03:30,018
the community and country
can afford to maintain

51
00:03:30,242 --> 00:03:32,267
at every stage of
their development,

52
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:37,596
in the spirit of self reliance
and self determination,".

53
00:03:37,996 --> 00:03:40,859
The declaration goes on
to say that

54
00:03:41,292 --> 00:03:44,767
"it is the first level of contact
of individuals,

55
00:03:44,973 --> 00:03:48,448
the family and community
with the national health system

56
00:03:48,678 --> 00:03:51,178
bringing health care
as close as possible to

57
00:03:51,411 --> 00:03:55,611
where people live and work
and constitutes the first element

58
00:03:55,821 --> 00:04:00,259
of a continuing health 
care process,".

59
00:04:00,891 --> 00:04:04,204
The declaration also states that
primary health care is a

60
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:07,427
central function
and main focus

61
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:10,667
of the country's health system
and that it is

62
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:15,984
closely intertwined with social
and economic development.

63
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,808
This declaration, although it is
a high level document,

64
00:04:20,029 --> 00:04:23,854
has very practical implications.
In particular,

65
00:04:24,109 --> 00:04:27,359
it gave the fundamental principles
of how health systems

66
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:31,403
must be organized.
Health systems are not only composed

67
00:04:31,657 --> 00:04:35,482
of public hospitals providing
diagnosis and care.

68
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:39,294
Primary health care stretches
far into the community

69
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,928
as we know that determinants
of health can be found in

70
00:04:43,133 --> 00:04:46,758
domains as diverse as
education, communication,

71
00:04:46,972 --> 00:04:50,897
agriculture,
infrastructure and so forth.

72
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:54,309
It involves a variety of very 
important roles,

73
00:04:54,527 --> 00:04:58,739
such as promotion of proper
nutrition, supply of safe water,

74
00:04:58,949 --> 00:05:01,587
family planning and education
concerning prevention

75
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:06,077
of major health problems.
Also, health systems involve

76
00:05:06,274 --> 00:05:09,249
not only public but also
private health structures,

77
00:05:09,464 --> 00:05:12,451
which can be operated by
faith based organizations or

78
00:05:12,662 --> 00:05:16,637
charities as well as
for-profit enterprises.

79
00:05:16,861 --> 00:05:19,824
We will remain focussed on the
public health care system

80
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:22,082
for the purpose of this course.

81
00:05:22,707 --> 00:05:27,144
Every country has it's own way
to organize the different layers

82
00:05:27,363 --> 00:05:31,276
of the public health system
but in general it is or should be

83
00:05:31,514 --> 00:05:34,676
influenced by the principles
of primary health care,

84
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:39,820
which we have just described.
These different layers can

85
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:43,720
be represented in the form
of a pyramid to express

86
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:46,957
the number of facilites
at each level as well as

87
00:05:47,158 --> 00:05:49,558
the degree
of specialization.

88
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:54,217
One generally finds a first contact
point at the base of the pyramid,

89
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:57,547
which is the primary level
properly speaking.

90
00:05:57,804 --> 00:06:00,904
In other words, if you have a
health problem that is where

91
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:04,422
you will enter into contact 
with the health system.

92
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:07,928
If your case cannot be treated
at the primary level,

93
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:12,824
you will be referred to the upper
layer called secondary health care.

94
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:15,648
This will typically be a 
regional hospital

95
00:06:15,882 --> 00:06:19,719
with capacity to perform more
advanced surgical interventions

96
00:06:19,975 --> 00:06:23,250
and to perform more sophisticated
diagnostic procedures.

97
00:06:23,525 --> 00:06:26,925
The tertiary layer
is for more complex cases,

98
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,316
which require highly
specialized services.

99
00:06:30,614 --> 00:06:33,464
These will typically be found in
larger structures

100
00:06:33,721 --> 00:06:36,496
such as central hospitals.

101
00:06:37,134 --> 00:06:41,634
The primary level is ideally where 
a majority of the health problems

102
00:06:41,828 --> 00:06:45,041
affecting the community
will be taken care of.

103
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:49,242
It may involve independent
general practitioners,

104
00:06:49,468 --> 00:06:52,468
health posts operated
by community health workers,

105
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:55,892
health centers
or small district hospitals

106
00:06:56,096 --> 00:06:58,434
located close to
the communities.

107
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:01,913
This level will, for example,
include the capacity

108
00:07:02,121 --> 00:07:05,934
to assist child deliveries,
to diagnose frequent and simple

109
00:07:06,145 --> 00:07:08,945
conditions and provide basic care.

110
00:07:09,210 --> 00:07:13,985
Ideally the health services
at this level should also include

111
00:07:14,203 --> 00:07:18,716
the capacity to perform
basic surgeries such as C-sections.

112
00:07:19,334 --> 00:07:21,346
As we think about
improving health

113
00:07:21,555 --> 00:07:25,818
and reinforcing health systems
with innovative medical devices

114
00:07:26,051 --> 00:07:30,889
this layer is precisely where we
should focus our attention first.

115
00:07:31,176 --> 00:07:34,464
Crucial technologies here
will include for example

116
00:07:34,672 --> 00:07:38,547
ultrasound for antenatal exams,
sphygmomanometers to 

117
00:07:38,774 --> 00:07:42,299
detect high blood pressure,
oxygen concentrators for

118
00:07:42,521 --> 00:07:47,021
acute respiratory destress or
radiology for diagnosing trauma

119
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:49,456
from road traffic
accidents.

120
00:07:49,815 --> 00:07:52,478
This is also where a close
follow-up of patients,

121
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:56,857
such as adherence to medication
should be provided.

122
00:07:57,097 --> 00:08:00,009
Many other crucial medical
activities should take place

123
00:08:00,218 --> 00:08:03,281
at this primary level;
close to the communities

124
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:07,011
such as campaigns for vaccination,
screening campaigns for

125
00:08:07,242 --> 00:08:12,067
specific diseases or awareness
campaigns for reproductive health.

126
00:08:12,293 --> 00:08:15,018
Now that we know the different
layers of a health system

127
00:08:15,232 --> 00:08:19,757
focused on primary health care,
let's look into the conditions

128
00:08:19,986 --> 00:08:22,386
which make them function well.

129
00:08:22,608 --> 00:08:25,471
The World Health Organization
has defined a framework

130
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:28,870
of 6 building blocks
for health systems.

131
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:33,101
Each of these building blocks
is of crucial importance.

132
00:08:33,416 --> 00:08:37,328
First a health system needs
adequate health services,

133
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:41,310
which means services that deliver
effective, safe quality

134
00:08:41,525 --> 00:08:45,900
health intervention with a
minimum waste of resources.

135
00:08:46,281 --> 00:08:49,719
The system also requires
a well performing workforce.

136
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:53,154
That is, one that is well trained,
sufficiently staffed

137
00:08:53,385 --> 00:08:56,910
and fairly distributed.
Health information systems

138
00:08:57,105 --> 00:09:01,380
must be in place which ensure the
production, analysis, dissemination

139
00:09:01,598 --> 00:09:05,085
and use of reliable information
on health determinants,

140
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:08,615
health system performance
and health status.

141
00:09:08,888 --> 00:09:12,913
As you can see, our fourth block
involves having equitable access to

142
00:09:13,129 --> 00:09:17,104
essential medical products,
vaccines and technologies

143
00:09:17,325 --> 00:09:21,462
of assured quality, safety,
efficacy and cost effectiveness

144
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:24,592
and which are
scientifically sound.

145
00:09:24,822 --> 00:09:28,534
This is crucially important.
It is out of question

146
00:09:28,737 --> 00:09:34,687
to rely on sub-standard solutions
just because the country is poor.

147
00:09:35,027 --> 00:09:37,590
The next block
concerns health financing,

148
00:09:37,812 --> 00:09:41,587
which is not only about raising
adequate funds for health,

149
00:09:41,795 --> 00:09:45,282
but also about protecting
people from impoverishment

150
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:49,092
associated with having
to pay for health services.

151
00:09:49,615 --> 00:09:52,703
Finally, leadership and governance
involves ensuring

152
00:09:52,928 --> 00:09:58,065
strategic policy frameworks exist,
combined with effective oversight,

153
00:09:58,296 --> 00:10:02,383
as well as regulation
and accountability.

154
00:10:02,656 --> 00:10:06,469
As we can see, reinforcing
health systems will necessarily

155
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:09,453
involve the provision of
adequate medical devices.

156
00:10:09,736 --> 00:10:13,686
However we need to carefully
assess the insertion

157
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:16,462
of these medial devices
into the system

158
00:10:16,712 --> 00:10:19,425
in order to ensure that
they contribute

159
00:10:19,657 --> 00:10:21,757
to strengthen it as a whole.

160
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:25,299
As we will see, it is for example
absolutely crucial to know

161
00:10:25,512 --> 00:10:29,925
who will provide maintenance and 
repair for these medical devices.

162
00:10:30,513 --> 00:10:33,313
I would like to discuss yet
another important angle

163
00:10:33,556 --> 00:10:37,606
from which we need to consider
the importance of medical devices.

164
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,372
It is related to what is called
the burden of disease.

165
00:10:43,797 --> 00:10:46,697
There are different metrics
available to characterize

166
00:10:46,935 --> 00:10:51,885
disease burden, but let us just
have a look at the overall mortality

167
00:10:52,107 --> 00:10:56,182
per 100 000 people
over all age groups.

168
00:10:56,467 --> 00:11:00,129
Here we have a graph showing
the 10 main causes of death

169
00:11:00,413 --> 00:11:03,063
recorded by the
World Health Organization for

170
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:08,666
low and lower
middle income countries in 2004.

171
00:11:08,997 --> 00:11:11,909
There are 3 different
types of causes:

172
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,902
infectious diseases,
highlighted in orange,

173
00:11:15,117 --> 00:11:17,679
non-communicable
diseases in blue

174
00:11:17,944 --> 00:11:21,781
and injuries and in particular
road injuries in green.

175
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:24,900
Note the importance of
non-communicable diseases

176
00:11:25,115 --> 00:11:28,352
such as cardiovascular
and respiratory diseases,

177
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:31,055
as well as diabetes
and cancers.

178
00:11:31,266 --> 00:11:35,466
They represent an overwhelming
majority of the causes of death

179
00:11:35,711 --> 00:11:40,711
represented here with 60%.
Also note the importance of

180
00:11:40,938 --> 00:11:45,176
road traffic accidents which will 
tend to increase in the coming years.

181
00:11:45,482 --> 00:11:48,457
Finally, there is still
the important number of deaths

182
00:11:48,668 --> 00:11:53,418
related to perinatal conditions;
that is deaths of newborns

183
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:55,290
which are not shown here.

184
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:58,115
According to the World
Health Organization,

185
00:11:58,335 --> 00:12:02,060
perinatal deaths - of which the 
main causes are prematurity,

186
00:12:02,267 --> 00:12:10,517
asphyxia and infections - will represent
over 8% of all deaths in 2030.

187
00:12:11,109 --> 00:12:13,684
This table gives us a blueprint
on how to determine 

188
00:12:13,909 --> 00:12:16,509
where priorities must be set
as we think of

189
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:19,913
developing essential
medical devices.

190
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,840
Now that we understand the
importance of medical devices

191
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:27,030
in the framework of health systems
let us get a sense

192
00:12:27,258 --> 00:12:30,283
of how available medical
devices really are.

193
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:34,285
As you may have suspected,
medical devices are not available

194
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:37,206
to a large fraction of
the world's population.

195
00:12:37,705 --> 00:12:42,793
This graph shows you an estimate
based on 67 countries,

196
00:12:42,997 --> 00:12:47,584
which account for more than 90%
of total medical devices

197
00:12:47,804 --> 00:12:51,029
sales revenues.
As you can see

198
00:12:51,537 --> 00:12:55,512
the Middle East and African market
is virtually non-existant,

199
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:59,255
in spite of the high
burden of disease in these regions.

200
00:12:59,789 --> 00:13:04,026
Even in Asia the numbers are bleak
when we realize that in fact

201
00:13:04,233 --> 00:13:10,583
Japan alone consumes 10%
out of the 17% for Asia.

202
00:13:10,967 --> 00:13:16,692
In fact, in 2009 only 10 countries
accounted for over 80%

203
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:20,053
of the world's sales revenues
with the US alone

204
00:13:20,268 --> 00:13:23,343
consuming 40%
followed by Japan, 10%

205
00:13:23,687 --> 00:13:26,862
Germany, 8%
and France, 4%.

206
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:30,592
The imbalance is absolutely
striking and the numbers

207
00:13:30,824 --> 00:13:35,324
speak for themselves. Nearly 2/3
of the global medical devices

208
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,387
are consumed by these 4 countries
alone while they represent

209
00:13:39,629 --> 00:13:43,017
less than 9% of the
world's population.

210
00:13:43,377 --> 00:13:46,452
The design of medical devices
is very dependent on

211
00:13:46,735 --> 00:13:48,985
the context for which
they were intended.

212
00:13:49,734 --> 00:13:53,122
Medical devices developed to
work in industrialized countries

213
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:57,290
rely on quality infrastructure,
sufficient financial resources,

214
00:13:57,499 --> 00:13:59,874
adequately trained personal
and controlled

215
00:14:00,097 --> 00:14:02,959
environmental conditions.
You will have recognized

216
00:14:03,169 --> 00:14:05,344
the main challenges caused
by the context of

217
00:14:05,552 --> 00:14:08,827
low and middle income countries.
As a consequence

218
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,702
there is a large mismatch between
what low and middle income

219
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:16,721
countries need and what is 
available in the market today.

220
00:14:16,979 --> 00:14:19,467
As we have seen, the need for
adequate medical devices

221
00:14:19,695 --> 00:14:22,858
is phenomenal and we hope
that many of you

222
00:14:23,081 --> 00:14:26,719
will now start to think about
innovative medical devices.

223
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:27,654
Goodbye.
