1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,219
The topic of today's lecture is
Energy as an Essential Technology.

3
00:00:13,932 --> 00:00:18,649
It is estimated that nearly 1.3B
people do not have access to

4
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:22,898
electricity. And this has great
consequences. According to statistics

5
00:00:23,098 --> 00:00:30,272
from the WHO around 3B people
cook and heat their homes using

6
00:00:30,472 --> 00:00:35,940
open fires and simply stones. They
burn coal and biomass such as wood

7
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:40,886
animal dung and crop waste. And over
4 million people die prematurely

8
00:00:41,086 --> 00:00:44,485
from illnesses attributed to 
household air pollution 

9
00:00:44,685 --> 00:00:47,125
from cooking with solid fuels.

10
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:50,888
While more than 50% of premature
deaths from pneumonia among children

11
00:00:51,088 --> 00:00:57,132
under 5 are caused by particular 
matter such as soot, which is inhaled

12
00:00:57,332 --> 00:01:02,693
from household air pollution, and 3.8
million premature deaths annually

13
00:01:02,893 --> 00:01:06,726
from non-communicable diseases
including stroke, ischemic heart

14
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:12,138
disease, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease and lung cancer

15
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:15,695
are all attributed to exposure to
household air pollution. 

16
00:01:15,895 --> 00:01:21,307
Therefore the lack of access to power
is truly a major global concern.

17
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:25,145
Before we continue, let's briefly
look at how the global energy supply

18
00:01:25,345 --> 00:01:30,064
chain is structured in general. It
consists of primary energy sources

19
00:01:30,264 --> 00:01:38,413
that include Coal, Oil, Gas, Uranium,
Hydro, Biomass, Solar, Wind, 

20
00:01:38,613 --> 00:01:43,753
Geothermal, Ocean energies, etc. 
These primary energy sources need

21
00:01:43,953 --> 00:01:48,836
to be converted and processed into
energy carriers such as Heat, 

22
00:01:49,036 --> 00:01:53,678
Electricity and Fuels. 
The energy carriers may be stored

23
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:57,685
and then distributed to the final
consumer for usage. For example,

24
00:01:57,885 --> 00:02:01,501
fuel stored in specialized tanks 
as it is combustible. 

25
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:06,650
And then distributed via road, rail
and the sea. Whereas, electricity

26
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:10,560
requires and extensive great network
for distribution. 

27
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,559
And surplus grid electricity's mainly
stored in dams as hydroelectricity.

28
00:02:15,434 --> 00:02:19,617
Surplus electricity may typically
arise from energy sources which

29
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:23,724
produce electricity intermittently.
Where intermittent energy sources

30
00:02:23,924 --> 00:02:27,774
are those sources whose supply can't
be controlled by the operator

31
00:02:27,974 --> 00:02:32,175
to be continuously available as 
needed. Which is the case with a

32
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:37,989
variety of renewable energy sources.
Such as the wind, solar, tidal waves.

33
00:02:38,189 --> 00:02:41,692
Therefore, when they are available,
one may wish to generate a maximum

34
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:46,447
of energy, which you can store and
retrieve upon need.

35
00:02:46,647 --> 00:02:52,696
There are a variety of uses of energy
in all phases of our daily lives, which

36
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:59,303
include: transport, construction,
industry, domestic use, agriculture

37
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:01,721
communications, etc. 

38
00:03:01,921 --> 00:03:05,147
Let us now look at who produces 
energy around the world. 

39
00:03:05,347 --> 00:03:09,769
As can be seen on the map, North 
America and most of Asia dominate

40
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:12,324
energy production capacity. 

41
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:17,253
Let us now look at who consumes
energy around the world.

42
00:03:17,453 --> 00:03:22,923
With respect to terminology, we know
that global energy produced actually

43
00:03:23,123 --> 00:03:28,357
differs from the world final energy
consumption because much of the

44
00:03:28,557 --> 00:03:32,775
energy that is acquired by humans
is lost as other forms of energy

45
00:03:32,975 --> 00:03:37,319
during the process of its refinement
into usable forms of energy, 

46
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,799
And it's transport from its initial
place of supply to consumers. 

47
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:45,595
For instance, when oil is extracted
from the ground it must be refined

48
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:50,235
into gasoline so that it can be used
in a car, and then transported over

49
00:03:50,435 --> 00:03:54,158
the long distances to gas stations
where it can be accessible

50
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:59,595
to consumers. So, global energy
consumption refers to the fraction

51
00:03:59,795 --> 00:04:04,292
of the world's primary energy that is
used in its final form by humanity.

52
00:04:04,492 --> 00:04:08,520
We see that the global distribution
of energy consumption is almost

53
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:12,719
a carbon copy of the energy
production distribution maps.

54
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,298
In particular, we note
 that some
of the poorest countries, notably

55
00:04:17,498 --> 00:04:21,995
in Africa and South Asia, score 
the lowest in both production

56
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:24,638
and consumption levels. 

57
00:04:24,838 --> 00:04:28,304
According to the 2016 report from
the International Energy Agency

58
00:04:28,504 --> 00:04:33,775
fossil fuels account for a share of
about 81% in the total of primary

59
00:04:33,975 --> 00:04:39,533
sources of energy. Which can be 
broken down into 31.3% Petrolium

60
00:04:39,733 --> 00:04:48,971
28.6% coal, and 21.2% natural gas.
Amounting to a total of 81.1%

61
00:04:49,171 --> 00:04:53,588
share for fossil fuels in the primary
energy consumption in the world.

62
00:04:53,788 --> 00:04:59,897
Well, non-fossil sources include
10.3% from biofuels and waste,

63
00:05:00,097 --> 00:05:05,867
4.8 % from nuclear, 2.4 % from
hydroelectricity.

64
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:09,799
Now, although fossil fuels are
continuously being formed via

65
00:05:09,999 --> 00:05:13,697
natural processes, they are considered
to be non-renewable resources

66
00:05:13,897 --> 00:05:17,369
because they take millions of years
to form. And the known reserves

67
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:21,497
available today are being depleted
much faster than any new ones

68
00:05:21,697 --> 00:05:25,715
are being made. However, the use
of fossil fuels has been linked to

69
00:05:25,915 --> 00:05:30,018
serious environmental concerns, as
the combustion of fossil fuels is

70
00:05:30,218 --> 00:05:35,073
set to produce a net increase of 
10.65 billion tons of atmospheric

71
00:05:35,273 --> 00:05:39,789
carbon dioxide per year. And carbon
dioxide is one of the main

72
00:05:39,989 --> 00:05:43,261
greenhouse gases that is set to
contribute to global warming. 

73
00:05:43,461 --> 00:05:47,092
And hence, there has been a global
movement towards advocating

74
00:05:47,292 --> 00:05:50,770
the use of renewable energy sources
to produce energy. 

75
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:54,831
And where the favoured renewable 
energy sources include solar, 

76
00:05:55,031 --> 00:05:58,871
wind and geothermal sources.
And most of these sources

77
00:05:59,071 --> 00:06:03,421
happen to be in abundant supply, in
fact, in some of or all the poorest

78
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:07,212
countries that still lack energy
supply today.

79
00:06:08,387 --> 00:06:12,923
The majority of energy today is
derived from fossil sources. 

80
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:18,342
The generation and use of energy
has been accompanied by collateral

81
00:06:18,542 --> 00:06:23,522
damage to the environment, however.
The burning of coal, natural gas,

82
00:06:23,722 --> 00:06:29,291
and oil for electricity and heat is
the largest single source of global

83
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:34,913
greenhouse gas emission. Greenhouse
gas emission from the transportation

84
00:06:35,113 --> 00:06:41,288
sector account for about 40 % and 
primarily involve fossil fuels

85
00:06:41,488 --> 00:06:44,836
burnt for road rail and marine
transportation. 

86
00:06:45,036 --> 00:06:48,512
Almost all of the world's 
transportation energy comes from

87
00:06:48,712 --> 00:06:52,953
Petroleum based fuels. Largely
gasoline and diesel. 

88
00:06:53,157 --> 00:06:55,818
Thus, there's an urgent need for
technology innovations

89
00:06:56,018 --> 00:06:57,701
that are environmentally clean.

90
00:06:57,901 --> 00:07:02,635
Renewable energy sources such as
solar, wind and geothermal look

91
00:07:02,835 --> 00:07:06,076
to be the ideal candidates to fill
this global energy gap, 

92
00:07:06,276 --> 00:07:09,853
as well as address the concerns we 
have with greenhouse emissions. 

93
00:07:10,053 --> 00:07:13,704
However, in reality, progress has
been alarmingly slow, especially

94
00:07:13,904 --> 00:07:17,802
in developing countries which have
abundance of these energy sources.

95
00:07:18,002 --> 00:07:22,027
One major issue relates to 
economics, in fact. 

96
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:25,436
While the cost of the infrastructure
itself has been going down

97
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:29,673
dramatically recently, it's still
very difficult to match the overall

98
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:35,145
cost of generating each kilowatt
when compared to using fossil fuels

99
00:07:35,345 --> 00:07:40,325
such as coal. For example, a solar
energy project in Rwanda that cost

100
00:07:40,525 --> 00:07:46,006
about 24 million US dollars to build
generates electricity at a rate of

101
00:07:46,206 --> 00:07:49,379
24 cents per kilowatt hour.

102
00:07:49,579 --> 00:07:56,513
While industry experts claim that
if natural gases is used instead, 

103
00:07:56,713 --> 00:07:59,713
it would generate electricity at half of 
that cost.

104
00:07:59,913 --> 00:08:03,049
Now how do you determine solar
energy generation cost?

105
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:08,793
A common metric is the levelized
cost of electricity, LCOE.

106
00:08:08,993 --> 00:08:13,412
which is simply the sum of all cost
over the lifetime of the facility.

107
00:08:13,612 --> 00:08:17,438
divided by the sum of all energy 
produced over lifetime by that

108
00:08:17,638 --> 00:08:22,299
facility. Now, since the costs afer
installation, are minimal for solar

109
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:25,887
electricity, then the relevant costs are 
the equipment purchase price,

110
00:08:26,087 --> 00:08:30,175
installation cost and the cost of
land, that is capital cost. 

111
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:33,911
Equipment components of a 
typical solar system comprise

112
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:37,361
solar modules and other equipment
such as an inverter, 

113
00:08:37,574 --> 00:08:39,920
connection devices
and storage devices. 

114
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,783
One of the main cost factors has 
been the price of solar cells,

115
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:49,277
which are used to make the solar
modules.

116
00:08:49,477 --> 00:08:55,845
But from 2006 to 2014 the worldwide
average prices for solar modules

117
00:08:56,045 --> 00:09:00,722
have dropped by about 78 % to
the extent that it is anticipated

118
00:09:00,922 --> 00:09:04,335
that PV (photovoltaic) solar cost will 
reach conventional Coal Parity

119
00:09:04,535 --> 00:09:10,874
by 2017, which simply means that
the cost of generating one watt of

120
00:09:11,074 --> 00:09:15,933
electrical power will be similar
for coal and solar energy.

121
00:09:16,133 --> 00:09:20,867
This factor is expected to encourage
a shift to more solar energy

122
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:24,213
electricity plants being built in
the future. 

123
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:26,892
And less nuclear plants being built.

124
00:09:27,092 --> 00:09:30,403
And the continued advancement in
technologies for distributed

125
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,832
electrical systems and energy 
storage will also have a major

126
00:09:34,032 --> 00:09:37,713
impact on the adoption and
integration of renewable energies

127
00:09:37,913 --> 00:09:39,649
into power utilities. 

128
00:09:39,849 --> 00:09:43,220
Transportation currently accounts
for about half of global

129
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:47,257
oil consumption in over 1/4 of
global greenhouse gas emissions

130
00:09:47,457 --> 00:09:51,410
from fossil fuels. Of even more
concern though is that carbon

131
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:54,967
dioxide emission derived from
transportation have increased more

132
00:09:55,167 --> 00:09:58,784
rapidly than the total global 
emissions in the past 2 decades,

133
00:09:58,984 --> 00:10:01,984
according to a report from
International Council of Clean

134
00:10:02,184 --> 00:10:03,677
Transportation. 

135
00:10:03,877 --> 00:10:08,467
This report also states that
world's motor vehicle population

136
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:11,845
will double over the next 2 decades.

137
00:10:12,045 --> 00:10:15,361
And the transportation sector
is a hole, which also includes

138
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:18,321
commercial trunks, rail, marine,
and aviation.

139
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:21,521
It is also expected to continue to
grow at a similar pace

140
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:24,321
over the same period. 

141
00:10:24,521 --> 00:10:27,857
This forecast that does underscore
the importance of current and

142
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:31,921
future strategies that target
reductions in oil consumption

143
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:36,335
and greenhouse gases from the 
transportation sector.

144
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:40,520
Now, from a technology viewpoint
various alternative initiatives

145
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,419
are ongoing towards reducing and
replacing fossil fuels

146
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:46,301
in transportation. 

147
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:50,693
These include biofuels, electric
and hydrogen powered vehicles

148
00:10:50,893 --> 00:10:54,868
all of which still have their pros and
cons today. 

149
00:10:55,068 --> 00:10:58,741
For example, biofuels have low
emissions in general, 

150
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:02,186
however, they are typically made
from vegetables and food crops

151
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:06,278
such as rapeseed for biodiesel.
And thus can adversely affect

152
00:11:06,478 --> 00:11:10,135
the food prices. Unfortunately,
the most farm equipment

153
00:11:10,335 --> 00:11:14,438
involved in crop production
typically runs on Petroleum.

154
00:11:14,638 --> 00:11:17,950
thus reducing the net benefits.

155
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:23,114
While cars running on hydrogen
fuels may give out zero greenhouse

156
00:11:23,314 --> 00:11:28,277
emissions, besides water vapor,
unfortunately hydrogene is very

157
00:11:28,477 --> 00:11:33,759
expensive to transport. And also, 
currently hydrogen fuel is primarily

158
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:39,081
made from natural gas, which is non-
renewable, and also uses processes

159
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:42,814
that create significant 
CO2 emissions.

160
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:48,410
As we said earlier, there are still 
over 1 billion people without

161
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:53,953
electricity today. In sub-saharan
Africa the overall average urban

162
00:11:54,153 --> 00:11:59,081
electrification rate is 60 %
compared with only 14 % in

163
00:11:59,281 --> 00:12:03,568
rural areas. So, one of the biggest
challenges is how to reach

164
00:12:03,768 --> 00:12:07,268
and provide electricity to the rural
and poorer communities that are

165
00:12:07,468 --> 00:12:09,970
typically off the electricity grid. 

166
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:13,595
There are various promising initiatives
in East Africa worth mentioning,

167
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:17,390
that have intelligently benefited
from mobile telephony for

168
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,766
their success. One such example,
is the social enterprise M-Kopa

169
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:25,663
which operates in 3 countries 
currently, namely Kenya, Uganda

170
00:12:25,863 --> 00:12:30,262
and Tanzania. M-Kopa offers a 
package of useful appliances,

171
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:35,363
such as LED lights, mobile phone
charger, and a radio. 

172
00:12:35,563 --> 00:12:39,370
All powered by a solar panel and a
storage battery. 

173
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:43,636
Payments are made via the mobile
phone and instead of paying up

174
00:12:43,836 --> 00:12:47,451
for the package upfront, the client
pays monthly installments.

175
00:12:47,651 --> 00:12:52,342
Where the amounts are typically
less than the monthly cost of Kerosine

176
00:12:52,542 --> 00:12:57,479
for lamps. And once the full amount
is paid, the package then belongs to

177
00:12:57,679 --> 00:13:01,618
the client and they can go back later
for bigger and more sophisticated

178
00:13:01,818 --> 00:13:06,254
appliances, such as a flat screen
television.

179
00:13:06,454 --> 00:13:10,594
So, the main trick and secret for 
success is that they have managed

180
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:14,353
to convince the customers that are
buying the appliances that they are

181
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:18,281
buying the appliances rather than
paying for electricity. 

182
00:13:18,481 --> 00:13:22,946
M-Kopa intends to offer a low energy
refrigerators that could also help

183
00:13:23,146 --> 00:13:26,687
the customers start up a 
small restaurant

184
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:30,066
or grocery stores and other forms
of businesses. 

185
00:13:30,266 --> 00:13:33,860
There are various other inspiring
and innovative initiatives taking on

186
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,539
the challenge of rural electrification
in developing countries,

187
00:13:37,739 --> 00:13:40,989
which have been provided in the
reference section at the end of

188
00:13:41,189 --> 00:13:44,508
this lecture. And you're highly
encouraged to consult them

189
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,708
especially if taking this course for
credit. 

190
00:13:47,908 --> 00:13:51,853
This now brings us to the end of
this lecture today. Goodbye.
