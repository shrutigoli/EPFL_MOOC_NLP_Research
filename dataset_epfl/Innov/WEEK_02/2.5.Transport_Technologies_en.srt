00:00:23,301 --> 00:00:26,335
Hello. Inadequate access
to basic health facilities

2
00:00:26,547 --> 00:00:30,826
in hospitals, is the cause
of an estimated 75%

3
00:00:31,026 --> 00:00:33,646
of birth-related child mortality.

4
00:00:34,343 --> 00:00:38,025
Today, we will talk about
sustainable transport technologies, 

5
00:00:38,225 --> 00:00:41,712
which can be defined as transports
which are safe, clean,

6
00:00:41,912 --> 00:00:45,393
affordable and which contribute
to economic development. 

7
00:00:46,532 --> 00:00:49,393
Transport of goods and people
is an essential driver

8
00:00:49,628 --> 00:00:51,642
of economic and social development.

9
00:00:51,842 --> 00:00:55,657
It brings opportunities for the poor
and enables economies

10
00:00:55,857 --> 00:00:57,142
to be more competitive. 

11
00:00:57,342 --> 00:00:59,739
Transport technology
connects people 

12
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:02,375
to jobs, education and healthcare.

13
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:07,257
It enables global and local trade
by supplying goods and services. 

14
00:01:07,461 --> 00:01:10,629
It also allows social interaction
between people

15
00:01:10,896 --> 00:01:13,435
and promotes social inclusion
of the poor. 

16
00:01:15,051 --> 00:01:19,385
Let us define a general framework
to help analyze this vast subject. 

17
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:23,337
The basic function of transport
is to move people, animals

18
00:01:23,656 --> 00:01:25,780
and goods from
one place to another. 

19
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,949
There are of course multiple ways
to achieve this function

20
00:01:29,149 --> 00:01:32,137
and these are called
transport modes.

21
00:01:32,337 --> 00:01:35,805
Main modes of transport
are air, land and water. 

22
00:01:36,597 --> 00:01:40,519
Each mode can be separated, 
roughly speaking, into three elements

23
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:44,599
which are infrastructure,
vehicles and operations. 

24
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,832
The last element refers to how
the transport mode

25
00:01:48,032 --> 00:01:49,984
is operated and by whom. 

26
00:01:50,686 --> 00:01:54,983
Of course, another crucial component
of sustainable transport is missing,

27
00:01:55,183 --> 00:01:58,176
which is the policies
and governance dimension. 

28
00:01:58,376 --> 00:02:01,218
However, this subject would take us
too far away

29
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,287
from our focus on technologies.

30
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,079
As we think about technology
innovation in transport,

31
00:02:07,279 --> 00:02:10,921
it is useful to have this
simplified framework in mind. 

32
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,683
Technology is heavily involved
in all three elements 

33
00:02:14,883 --> 00:02:17,147
and all three modes of transport.

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,897
To make things a little clearer,
let us fill in the table 

35
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:24,737
with some examples,
and discuss the main issues 

36
00:02:24,937 --> 00:02:27,764
and opportunities
for technology innovation.

37
00:02:28,204 --> 00:02:30,681
Air transport is very important
for business, 

38
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,304
as it allows efficient trade
of perishable goods,

39
00:02:33,504 --> 00:02:35,716
such as  fresh food or flowers.

40
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:38,874
In Kenya for example,
over half a million people

41
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:41,380
depend on flower business
for a living.

42
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:45,305
Air transport, very importantly,
also opens the way for tourism. 

43
00:02:45,505 --> 00:02:47,728
Having a strong
air transport sector

44
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:50,482
will also attract
international businesses 

45
00:02:50,682 --> 00:02:53,129
to set up offices
and manufacturing sites

46
00:02:53,359 --> 00:02:55,376
in the country,
which creates jobs. 

47
00:02:56,067 --> 00:02:58,448
Air transport infrastructure
involves, for example, 

48
00:02:58,648 --> 00:03:01,639
airports, control towers
and navigation systems. 

49
00:03:02,535 --> 00:03:07,176
Over the ten years to 2005,
both passenger travel 

50
00:03:07,376 --> 00:03:10,574
and air freight
have increased by about 55%.

51
00:03:11,288 --> 00:03:13,723
This strong international
growth in aviation

52
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:16,873
is straining the capacities
of many low income countries. 

53
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:20,819
It generates high costs for countries
who struggle to maintain

54
00:03:21,013 --> 00:03:24,174
the capacity for proper function
and meet the demand.

55
00:03:24,729 --> 00:03:28,005
As a consequence, there is a risk
for degradation in safety,

56
00:03:28,205 --> 00:03:30,295
which is extremely important
to the development

57
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:31,893
of aviation services.

58
00:03:32,093 --> 00:03:35,920
West Africa, for example, has
an aviation accident rate

59
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,593
thirty times that
of the United States. 

60
00:03:39,224 --> 00:03:42,773
As far as vehicles, we can mention
airplanes and helicopters. 

61
00:03:42,973 --> 00:03:46,533
Of course, this sector has
an impact on the environment.

62
00:03:46,733 --> 00:03:52,056
Emissions represent 12% of all
CO2 released in the transport sector.

63
00:03:52,664 --> 00:03:56,898
In  terms of operations, air traffic
is operated by both public

64
00:03:57,098 --> 00:04:00,988
and private operators, who rely
on a series of technologies to track

65
00:04:01,227 --> 00:04:05,678
freight and passengers, to assure
security and to minimize delays. 

66
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:08,578
Technology innovation can be
an important contributor

67
00:04:08,778 --> 00:04:11,846
in improving safety, which is crucial
to the industries

68
00:04:12,071 --> 00:04:14,378
that depend on air transport.

69
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:17,407
New technology can also contribute
to reducing emissions,

70
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:21,695
which remains a big issue
in this industry, as we have seen.

71
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:25,445
Finally, innovative drone technology
will most certainly play

72
00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:27,479
an important role in this sector.

73
00:04:27,663 --> 00:04:30,088
And there are many experiments
currently being conducted

74
00:04:30,288 --> 00:04:32,910
by companies and research institutes.

75
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:36,712
Since the beginning of human history,
land transport

76
00:04:36,944 --> 00:04:39,637
has underpinned economic progress
and remains 

77
00:04:39,837 --> 00:04:42,185
an essential contributor
to development. 

78
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:46,169
It involves a wide variety
of infrastructures, such as roads,

79
00:04:46,369 --> 00:04:49,975
bridges, tunnels, railways,
train stations, fuel stations

80
00:04:50,175 --> 00:04:53,147
bike lanes and walkways,
but also pipelines,

81
00:04:53,347 --> 00:04:55,529
which can be used
to transport fluids.

82
00:04:56,021 --> 00:05:00,083
In Africa, road transport accounts
for 80% of the goods traffic

83
00:05:00,283 --> 00:05:03,159
and 90% of passenger traffic.

84
00:05:03,836 --> 00:05:06,418
This leaves a lot of room
for improvement, for example,

85
00:05:06,618 --> 00:05:11,068
in railway transport, especially
for long distances and high volume.

86
00:05:11,268 --> 00:05:13,833
In rail transport,
infrastructure construction 

87
00:05:14,033 --> 00:05:17,812
and maintenance costs remain a big
challenge for low income countries.

88
00:05:18,547 --> 00:05:21,624
For land transport there are
many vehicles, but we can cite

89
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:25,097
of course, cars, trucks,
buses, bicycles and trains.

90
00:05:25,297 --> 00:05:27,022
Again we should mention that pipelines
are both

91
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:29,601
a piece of infrastructure
and a vehicle. 

92
00:05:29,801 --> 00:05:33,632
Land transport can be operated
by individual car owners,

93
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:36,420
bus companies,
cities or even states. 

94
00:05:37,278 --> 00:05:41,133
Internal combustion engines
have revolutionized transport

95
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:46,283
yet they account for an estimated 15%
of global greenhouse gas emissions. 

96
00:05:46,855 --> 00:05:50,132
In large polluted cities such as
Kuala Lumpur or Jakarta,

97
00:05:50,332 --> 00:05:52,767
it is estimated that
the total economic damage  

98
00:05:52,955 --> 00:05:56,435
of air pollution represents
up to 10% of GDP. 

99
00:05:56,710 --> 00:06:00,107
Traffic congestion is another
very problematic issue,

100
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:02,125
which we
will discuss a little later.

101
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:07,735
Every year, around 1.3 million people
die as a result of road accidents, 

102
00:06:07,935 --> 00:06:11,267
and 78 million more
require medical care. 

103
00:06:11,467 --> 00:06:15,438
Low and middle income countries bear
over 90% of that burden. 

104
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:19,094
People who may not be poor
to start with, may become poor 

105
00:06:19,294 --> 00:06:23,178
due to a handicap or loss of life
of the family's breadwinner. 

106
00:06:23,378 --> 00:06:27,191
Technology innovation would
be especially welcome in three areas: 

107
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:31,936
improving safety, reducing pollution
and preventing traffic congestion. 

108
00:06:32,292 --> 00:06:35,843
Recent developments in making
vehicles such as buses,

109
00:06:36,043 --> 00:06:39,976
or intelligent systems capable
to predict and prevent crashes

110
00:06:40,176 --> 00:06:42,402
are very promising in this regard.

111
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:46,328
Water transport involves not only
maritime transport infrastructure

112
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:50,166
such as ports, lighthouses,
container cranes, but also

113
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:53,772
inland waterway infrastructure,
such as canals and locks.

114
00:06:53,972 --> 00:06:58,917
As for land transport, pipelines can
be used as submarine infrastructure 

115
00:06:59,117 --> 00:07:02,151
to transport fluids such as
oil, gas or water. 

116
00:07:02,351 --> 00:07:06,880
Vehicles can be ships, barges,
small boats and pipelines. 

117
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:10,026
Operations may involve
maritime companies 

118
00:07:10,226 --> 00:07:13,715
or simply individuals owning
a boat, or port authorities. 

119
00:07:13,915 --> 00:07:17,041
Maritime transport is the backbone
of international trade,

120
00:07:17,241 --> 00:07:20,483
as it represents 90%
of global trade by volume. 

121
00:07:21,002 --> 00:07:25,537
Because of the presence of rivers,
canals, lakes, inland waterways

122
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:28,678
also play an important role
for freight and passenger transport

123
00:07:28,878 --> 00:07:32,157
in China, Brazil, Vietnam,
Uganda and other countries. 

124
00:07:32,779 --> 00:07:35,597
One great technological innovation
in this sector 

125
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:37,606
is certainly the ISO container.

126
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:39,826
Since it has been
internationally normalized

127
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:44,454
it can be easily handled by standard
cranes and other equipment worldwide. 

128
00:07:44,654 --> 00:07:47,896
This has made global
supply chains extremely efficient. 

129
00:07:48,096 --> 00:07:51,541
Due to the great importance
of water transport in trade,

130
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:55,640
technology solutions that
can further reduce costs, 

131
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,039
improve speed and reliability,
will be very important

132
00:07:59,239 --> 00:08:01,255
contributors to development. 

133
00:08:01,455 --> 00:08:03,240
Here is now our complete table. 

134
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,804
This is, of course, by far not
an exhaustive view, and it reveals

135
00:08:07,004 --> 00:08:09,780
something else which is
quite obvious but yet very important. 

136
00:08:10,161 --> 00:08:13,593
In many cases, there will be several
transport modes involved, 

137
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:16,215
or more precisely,
transport vehicles. 

138
00:08:16,415 --> 00:08:19,247
This is called multimodal transport. 

139
00:08:19,447 --> 00:08:23,242
It is very important that
the transfers from one mode to another 

140
00:08:23,442 --> 00:08:26,965
are as efficient
and seamless as possible.

141
00:08:27,535 --> 00:08:30,863
As we discuss transport technologies,
let us keep in mind

142
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:33,530
that according to 
United Nations forecasts

143
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:39,238
by 2050, more than 67%, or
two-thirds of the word’s population

144
00:08:39,426 --> 00:08:40,932
will live in cities.

145
00:08:41,132 --> 00:08:45,471
Today the number of private cars 
is over 900 million worldwide.

146
00:08:45,671 --> 00:08:49,851
And it will reach an estimated
1.6 billion by 2035. 

147
00:08:50,484 --> 00:08:53,881
The largest increase will
take place in developing countries. 

148
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:57,404
One consequence
is traffic congestion.

149
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,203
Traffic congestion plagues
all major cities

150
00:09:00,424 --> 00:09:03,226
and has a great impact
on economic development.

151
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:06,881
Innovative ideas and incentives
are urgently needed 

152
00:09:07,094 --> 00:09:09,041
for efficient traffic management.

153
00:09:09,241 --> 00:09:12,395
It is, for example, crucial
to shift mobility away

154
00:09:12,595 --> 00:09:15,564
from individual private cars,
towards more efficient 

155
00:09:15,764 --> 00:09:19,910
public transportation, such as
bus rapid transportation systems.

156
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:25,077
Today, in many cities of Africa
and Asia, the proportion of trips

157
00:09:25,277 --> 00:09:28,112
made without cars is 90% or more. 

158
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:31,816
This raises again the issue
of road traffic accidents: 

159
00:09:32,016 --> 00:09:36,011
more than half the road deaths
in these urban areas

160
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:38,145
are pedestrians and cyclists. 

161
00:09:38,635 --> 00:09:41,067
These facts lead us to emphasize
the importance

162
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:45,486
of efficient solutions to protect
and support non-motorized transport 

163
00:09:45,686 --> 00:09:47,848
in cities and especially in slums.

164
00:09:48,506 --> 00:09:52,196
After this glimpse at
the urban context, let us now look 

165
00:09:52,405 --> 00:09:56,409
at the rural world, where still
a large fraction of today’s poor live.

166
00:09:57,498 --> 00:09:59,926
In order to measure access
to transports 

167
00:10:00,126 --> 00:10:02,490
we use the Rural Access Index. 

168
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:06,475
The Rural Access Index
measures the number of rural people

169
00:10:06,675 --> 00:10:09,787
who live within 2 kilometers
of an all-season road, 

170
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:12,778
as a proportion of
the total rural population. 

171
00:10:12,978 --> 00:10:16,261
Two kilometers is typically
equivalent to

172
00:10:16,457 --> 00:10:18,885
a walk of 20-25 minutes. 

173
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:23,090
An “all-season road” is a road
that is motorable all year round

174
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:26,210
by the prevailing means
of rural transport, for example

175
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:29,895
a pick-up or a truck which
is not a four-wheel-drive. 

176
00:10:30,756 --> 00:10:33,850
By this measure, globally,
about 1 billion people 

177
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:36,337
don’t have access
to adequate transportation.

178
00:10:36,765 --> 00:10:39,713
In Africa, two-thirds of
the rural population

179
00:10:39,913 --> 00:10:42,838
about 300 million of
the world’s poorest people

180
00:10:43,038 --> 00:10:45,836
do not have reliable access
to an all-weather road. 

181
00:10:46,036 --> 00:10:49,507
Most are thus locked
into subsistence living

182
00:10:49,707 --> 00:10:53,760
and have disadvantaged access
to reliable health care and education. 

183
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:56,732
As we said in the beginning
of this video, 

184
00:10:56,932 --> 00:11:00,671
the isolation of those communities
prevents them from an easy access 

185
00:11:00,871 --> 00:11:03,313
to health facilities
in the case of emergency. 

186
00:11:03,748 --> 00:11:07,550
I would like to speak about
a simple and yet innovative technology

187
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,279
that tries to address this need.

188
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:12,840
According to the World Bank,
between 40 to 60%

189
00:11:13,072 --> 00:11:15,007
of the people
in developing countries

190
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:19,023
live more than 8 kilometers
from a healthcare facility.

191
00:11:19,656 --> 00:11:24,449
In poor communities, the majority of health
facilities don’t have ambulances. 

192
00:11:24,649 --> 00:11:27,891
When they do, these vehicles
can’t access the patients 

193
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:32,025
due to a lack of adequate all-weather
roads as we have just seen.  

194
00:11:32,817 --> 00:11:37,617
A company called eRanger has noticed
that in many places where cars

195
00:11:37,817 --> 00:11:41,261
and pick-ups didn't have access,
motorbikes were still working.

196
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:45,238
The company has thus designed
a motorbike ambulance, 

197
00:11:45,438 --> 00:11:48,109
which has a side-car
for one patient.

198
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:50,965
It is light in weight,
rugged in design,

199
00:11:51,165 --> 00:11:53,349
and able to negotiate
the roughest terrain. 

200
00:11:53,549 --> 00:11:56,666
It comes with a complete set
of equipment, tools and spares

201
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:58,960
so that it is sustainable
in the bush, 

202
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,767
miles away from anywhere. 

203
00:12:01,405 --> 00:12:04,888
Over 2000 of these ambulances
have already been distributed 

204
00:12:05,088 --> 00:12:09,916
through major aid agencies, such as
UNICEF, UNHCR and Save The Children.

205
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:14,640
The complete ambulance sells
for around US$ 6000,

206
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,154
including training, which makes it
a very affordable solution. 

207
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:23,597
According to a study performed
in 2015 in a district in Uganda 

208
00:12:23,797 --> 00:12:27,083
where 26 such motorbike
ambulances were deployed,

209
00:12:27,283 --> 00:12:30,109
22,000 referral trips were made.

210
00:12:30,309 --> 00:12:34,698
This has had a massive impact
on infant and maternal mortality. 

211
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,976
I hope you now have many ideas
of innovative transport technologies. 

212
00:12:40,176 --> 00:12:42,499
Good-bye.
