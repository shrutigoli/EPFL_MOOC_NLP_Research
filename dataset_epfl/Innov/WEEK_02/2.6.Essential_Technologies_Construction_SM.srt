00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:02,460
<i>The topic of today's lecture is
Construction</i>

2
00:00:02,632 --> 00:00:04,695
<i>as an Essential Technology.</i>

3
00:00:22,468 --> 00:00:25,592
I start this lecture 
by asking you a simple question:

4
00:00:26,756 --> 00:00:30,042
The most consumed substance 
in the world is water,

5
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:32,105
but can you possibly guess

6
00:00:32,305 --> 00:00:34,630
what the 2nd
 most consumed substance is though?

7
00:00:35,485 --> 00:00:38,485
Let's talk more about 
construction technologies.

8
00:00:40,043 --> 00:00:43,056
<i>Construction technologies
 are used for the building</i>

9
00:00:43,231 --> 00:00:45,418
<i>and assembling 
of infrastructure.</i>

10
00:00:45,618 --> 00:00:48,756
<i>This includes public
 and private buildings,</i>

11
00:00:48,956 --> 00:00:51,956
<i>such as housing, 
schools, hospitals</i>

12
00:00:52,156 --> 00:00:55,156
<i> as well as the construction
 of roads and bridges.</i>

13
00:00:57,103 --> 00:01:00,128
<i>And the industrial infrastructure 
may include...</i>

14
00:01:00,322 --> 00:01:03,960
<i>refineries, mills, 
power generation,</i>

15
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:07,160
<i>and industrial 
manufacturing plants.</i>

16
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,585
<i>Now in order to arrive
 at the stage</i>

17
00:01:09,785 --> 00:01:12,035
<i>of being able 
to construct a building,</i>

18
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:15,207
<i>let’s take a brief look 
at the organization</i>

19
00:01:15,407 --> 00:01:18,407
<i>or value chain
 of the Construction Industry. </i>

20
00:01:18,607 --> 00:01:21,469
<i>It can basically be divided 
into three sectors.</i>

21
00:01:21,657 --> 00:01:23,857
<i>The first sector is 
Primary Activities, </i>

22
00:01:24,057 --> 00:01:27,344
<i>which involve the extraction, 
processing </i>

23
00:01:27,582 --> 00:01:29,895
<i>and use of raw materials 
from the earth.</i>

24
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:32,253
<i>The second one is 
Secondary Activities,</i>

25
00:01:32,453 --> 00:01:35,215
<i>which includes the manufacturing
 of finished goods</i>

26
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:38,515
<i>and the actual
 construction activity itself.</i>

27
00:01:38,715 --> 00:01:41,178
<i>While the third sector is
 Tertiary Activities,</i>

28
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:44,020
<i>which is essentially
 logistics and distribution.</i>

29
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,933
<i>Now some of the world’s largest 
construction materials companies </i>

30
00:01:48,143 --> 00:01:51,356
<i>are actually vertically integrated
 across all three sectors. </i>

31
00:01:51,556 --> 00:01:54,556
<i>In other words,
they carry out all the activities</i>

32
00:01:54,756 --> 00:01:56,918
<i> from primary to tertiary.</i>

33
00:01:57,118 --> 00:02:00,118
<i>Extracted materials 
may include</i>

34
00:02:00,318 --> 00:02:04,368
<i>sand, gravel,
limestone, slates,</i>

35
00:02:04,568 --> 00:02:09,406
<i>clay, gypsum, feldspar,
quartzite and more.</i>

36
00:02:09,940 --> 00:02:11,965
<i>One of the main 
Secondary Activities</i>

37
00:02:13,496 --> 00:02:12,146
<i> is making cement.</i>

38
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:16,677
<i>Cement can be made by heating clay and chalk</i>

39
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:19,202
<i> to fuse
 these materials together. </i>

40
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:22,402
<i>The resulting fused materials 
are then ground into powder,</i>

41
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,802
<i> that then forms cement.</i>

42
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:27,440
<i>Cement is a key ingredient
 in concrete.</i>

43
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:31,052
<i>And concrete is the 2nd most 
consumed substance in the world</i>

44
00:02:31,252 --> 00:02:32,883
<i> after water. </i>

45
00:02:33,083 --> 00:02:35,670
<i>Concrete is made 
from aggregate,</i>

46
00:02:35,845 --> 00:02:38,658
<i>cement and water and can either be mixed directly</i>

47
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,458
<i> on building sites</i>

48
00:02:40,658 --> 00:02:43,658
<i> or supplied ready-mixed 
from a concrete plant. </i>

49
00:02:44,461 --> 00:02:48,011
<i>And aggregates are made
 from sand, gravel and crushed rock</i>

50
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:50,248
<i> and they provide the base</i>

51
00:02:50,448 --> 00:02:52,597
<i>for all types 
of construction products.</i>

52
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:55,347
<i>Besides concrete, other products produced</i>

53
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:57,972
<i>in the Secondary Activities 
include asphalt</i>

54
00:02:58,172 --> 00:02:59,645
<i>and concrete products.</i>

55
00:02:59,845 --> 00:03:02,845
<i>Tertiary Activities,
on the other hand, involve</i>

56
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:06,445
<i> the distribution of raw materials 
and finished goods</i>

57
00:03:06,645 --> 00:03:09,958
<i>to customers for the construction 
of various types of buildings</i>

58
00:03:10,158 --> 00:03:12,201
<i> and transportation links:</i>

59
00:03:12,388 --> 00:03:16,088
<i>Cement is sold in bulk
to make ready-mixed concrete</i>

60
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:19,064
<i>and concrete products,
but it is also sold in bags</i>

61
00:03:19,264 --> 00:03:22,476
<i>to builders’ merchants 
for individuals to buy.</i>

62
00:03:23,314 --> 00:03:25,964
<i>Ready-mixed concrete
and concrete products</i>

63
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,126
<i>are sold to residential,</i>

64
00:03:28,326 --> 00:03:30,764
<i>commercial
and public contractors.</i>

65
00:03:31,547 --> 00:03:34,697
<i>By 2030, there will be
 about 3 billion people</i>

66
00:03:34,884 --> 00:03:38,272
<i> in need of proper housing
 and access to basic infrastructure.</i>

67
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:40,559
<i>Which means
 we need to complete</i>

68
00:03:40,759 --> 00:03:44,347
<i>about 96,000 housing units 
per day. </i>

69
00:03:45,368 --> 00:03:47,981
<i>What exactly is the driver 
for this housing crisis? </i>

70
00:03:48,181 --> 00:03:50,081
<i>Of course,
there are various factors,</i>

71
00:03:50,281 --> 00:03:52,968
<i> but urbanization is 
the principal culprit!</i>

72
00:03:53,168 --> 00:03:55,506
<i>The graph on the screen 
shows the percentage</i>

73
00:03:55,681 --> 00:03:57,793
<i>of urban populations
 living in slums</i>

74
00:03:57,974 --> 00:04:00,762
<i> and we’ll talk more about
 this subject in the next slide. </i>

75
00:04:00,962 --> 00:04:04,162
<i>According to
the World Bank estimates in 2011,</i>

76
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:06,712
<i>over 90% of urban growth</i>

77
00:04:06,912 --> 00:04:08,999
<i>is occurring
 in the developing world,</i>

78
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:12,287
<i>adding an estimate 
of 70 million new residents</i>

79
00:04:12,487 --> 00:04:15,499
<i> to urban areas each year. </i>

80
00:04:15,698 --> 00:04:17,573
<i>During the next two decades,</i>

81
00:04:17,773 --> 00:04:20,285
<i>the urban population
 is expected to double</i>

82
00:04:20,485 --> 00:04:22,710
<i> in the two poorest regions 
in the world,</i>

83
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:25,910
<i>South Asia 
and Sub-Saharan Africa. </i>

84
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:28,638
<i>Unfortunately,
a significant portion</i>

85
00:04:28,838 --> 00:04:30,988
<i>of the urban population
 in these regions </i>

86
00:04:31,168 --> 00:04:34,505
<i>do not have proper housing 
and live in slums. </i>

87
00:04:34,705 --> 00:04:38,230
<i>For example, in Asia,
30% of the urban population</i>

88
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:40,468
<i>resides in slums,</i>

89
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:43,043
<i>and this continent is 
currently home to half</i>

90
00:04:43,243 --> 00:04:45,568
<i> of the urban population 
of the world.</i>

91
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:47,380
<i>While in Africa,</i>

92
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:51,218
<i>about 62% of the urban population
 live in slums, </i>

93
00:04:51,418 --> 00:04:54,318
<i>And the Central African Republic
is the country that has</i>

94
00:04:54,493 --> 00:04:56,855
<i>the highest proportion
 of urban population</i>

95
00:04:57,055 --> 00:05:00,980
<i> living in slums,
which is 96%.</i>

96
00:05:01,905 --> 00:05:04,730
<i>Therefore,
there is a massive task ahead</i>

97
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,380
<i>to build enough houses,
in order to provide</i>

98
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,093
<i>a dignified home for all. </i>

99
00:05:09,293 --> 00:05:10,955
<i>And this challenge is highest</i>

100
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,068
<i>in the poorest regions
of the world. </i>

101
00:05:13,268 --> 00:05:16,505
<i>So, whatever solution
is proposed has to be</i>

102
00:05:16,705 --> 00:05:18,793
<i>cost-effective
and affordable.</i>

103
00:05:18,993 --> 00:05:21,993
<i>But unfortunately,
the construction industry,</i>

104
00:05:22,193 --> 00:05:25,380
<i>as we will discuss shortly,
has been a major contributor</i>

105
00:05:25,568 --> 00:05:28,393
<i>to non-sustainable
environmental actions. </i>

106
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:29,943
<i>So, it would be ideal</i>

107
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:32,967
<i>if the adopted
building construction solutions</i>

108
00:05:33,142 --> 00:05:37,217
<i>of tomorrow were also
environmentally sustainable.</i>

109
00:05:38,561 --> 00:05:42,510
Now speaking of sustainability 
in the construction industry,

110
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:45,035
what is the environmental impact

111
00:05:45,235 --> 00:05:48,235
of construction activities 
to our dear universe in fact?

112
00:05:49,285 --> 00:05:51,872
The construction industry
is involved in creating

113
00:05:52,072 --> 00:05:54,322
the physical assets
 which are the basis

114
00:05:54,522 --> 00:05:57,284
of virtually every aspect 
of development,

115
00:05:57,497 --> 00:06:00,747
but the construction sector is also
one of the largest exploiters

116
00:06:00,947 --> 00:06:02,560
of natural resources.

117
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:06,085
Around half of all 
non-renewable resources

118
00:06:06,285 --> 00:06:09,672
that humankind consumes119
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:12,022
are used in construction,

120
00:06:12,222 --> 00:06:15,535
making it one of the least
 sustainable industries in the world.

121
00:06:16,414 --> 00:06:19,214
Apart from its share
 of fossil fuel use,

122
00:06:19,414 --> 00:06:23,052
the construction industry is
a heavy user of several metals,

123
00:06:23,252 --> 00:06:26,964
whose remaining exploitable reserves
are limited.

124
00:06:27,686 --> 00:06:31,598
<i>Almost 50% of all global energy
is used in buildings. </i>

125
00:06:31,798 --> 00:06:34,923
<i>And about 50%
of all global water used </i>

126
00:06:35,123 --> 00:06:37,511
<i>is also utilized
in buildings.</i>

127
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:40,711
<i>Construction activity contributes 
to the loss of soil</i>

128
00:06:40,911 --> 00:06:43,911
<i>and agricultural land
through activities such as: </i>

129
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:46,273
<i>Quarrying and mining</i>

130
00:06:46,473 --> 00:06:49,748
<i>for the raw materials used
in construction.</i>

131
00:06:49,948 --> 00:06:53,036
<i>Conversion of agricultural land
to other uses,</i>

132
00:06:53,236 --> 00:06:57,661
<i>whether for urbanisation,
for roadbuilding,</i>

133
00:06:57,848 --> 00:07:01,536
<i> dams or other
civil engineering projects; </i>

134
00:07:02,568 --> 00:07:05,668
<i>And it may also be degraded</i>

135
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:09,281
<i>as a result of the local pollution
 or waste generation</i>

136
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:11,681
<i>associated with construction</i>

137
00:07:11,881 --> 00:07:14,068
<i>and building materials
production. </i>

138
00:07:14,881 --> 00:07:18,181
<i>Buildings contribute 40%
to drinking water pollution,</i>

139
00:07:18,381 --> 00:07:20,931
<i>and 50% to landfill waste.</i>

140
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:24,131
<i>Furthermore, construction 
contributes to air pollution</i>

141
00:07:24,331 --> 00:07:28,206
<i>through emissions
 of dust, fibre,</i>

142
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:30,706
<i>and toxic gases 
from site activities</i>

143
00:07:30,906 --> 00:07:33,906
<i>and building materials
production processes. </i>

144
00:07:34,106 --> 00:07:37,606
<i>And it contributes 50%
to global ozone depletion</i>

145
00:07:37,806 --> 00:07:42,468
<i> by the use and release of
chloro fluorocarbons in buildings,</i>

146
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:44,956
<i>and by the emission 
of carbon dioxide</i>

147
00:07:45,156 --> 00:07:46,856
<i>and other greenhouse gasses. </i>

148
00:07:47,643 --> 00:07:50,793
<i>Thus the construction industry
 contributes significantly</i>

149
00:07:50,968 --> 00:07:54,368
<i>to each of the areas
of environmental stress.  </i>

150
00:07:54,568 --> 00:07:57,081
<i>As we saw
in our early slides, </i>

151
00:07:57,281 --> 00:07:59,881
<i>cement is the key ingredient 
for making concrete,</i>

152
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:02,568
<i>which is the main material 
for making buildings</i>

153
00:08:02,768 --> 00:08:05,693
<i>and other infrastructure
 and the 2nd most consumed item</i>

154
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:07,418
<i> after water</i>

155
00:08:07,618 --> 00:08:10,306
<i>However,
one out of every 20 tonnes</i>

156
00:08:10,506 --> 00:08:13,781
<i>of human-made CO2
that enter the atmosphere</i>

157
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:17,431
<i>comes from the kilns
of cement factories. </i>

158
00:08:17,631 --> 00:08:20,356
<i>The sources of emissions 
in cement production</i>

159
00:08:20,556 --> 00:08:22,231
<i> are actually threefold:</i>

160
00:08:22,431 --> 00:08:26,131
<i>One, from the production
of the electrical energy</i>

161
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:28,793
<i>used to grind 
the raw materials;</i>

162
00:08:28,993 --> 00:08:31,993
<i>Two, these raw materials,</i>

163
00:08:32,193 --> 00:08:33,943
<i>such as limestone and clay,</i>

164
00:08:34,143 --> 00:08:37,956
<i>are then heated 
to 1450 in a kiln</i>

165
00:08:38,156 --> 00:08:41,493
<i>in order to form
a compound called clinker,</i>

166
00:08:41,693 --> 00:08:45,431
<i>which is subsequently crushed
and blended with gypsum</i>

167
00:08:45,631 --> 00:08:47,618
<i>to make cement.</i>

168
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,081
<i>The heating process
of this step</i>

169
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:53,281
<i>is also a major source
of emissions.</i>

170
00:08:54,098 --> 00:08:58,823
Now the third source is from 
the process emissions.

171
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:00,960
For example,

172
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:04,835
<i>when the limestone is heated,
it is converted into lime and CO2.</i>

173
00:09:06,199 --> 00:09:09,487
<i>And these emissions 
actually represent</i>

174
00:09:09,687 --> 00:09:12,687
<i>up to 65% of total emissions </i>

175
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:15,112
<i>linked to cement production.</i>

176
00:09:15,881 --> 00:09:17,543
<i>So, all together,</i>

177
00:09:17,743 --> 00:09:19,756
<i> if we can reduce the amount of clinker</i>

178
00:09:19,956 --> 00:09:21,981
<i>used in making cement,</i>

179
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:24,068
<i>we should potentially reduce</i>

180
00:09:24,268 --> 00:09:27,268
<i> the amount of CO2
in the atmosphere. </i>

181
00:09:28,047 --> 00:09:30,622
<i>And now there is a new 
cement innovation in fact</i>

182
00:09:30,822 --> 00:09:33,822
<i> that is based 
on this concept.</i>

183
00:09:34,022 --> 00:09:37,022
<i>Specifically it is based
on a blend of limestone</i>

184
00:09:37,222 --> 00:09:39,122
<i>and calcined clay,</i>

185
00:09:39,322 --> 00:09:42,085
<i>and it is called LC3.</i>

186
00:09:42,285 --> 00:09:44,285
<i>Now, in the LC3 cement, </i>

187
00:09:44,485 --> 00:09:48,085
<i>the amount of clinker needed 
has been reduced by 50%.</i>

188
00:09:48,285 --> 00:09:51,285
So, overall,
the LC3 cement innovation

189
00:09:51,485 --> 00:09:54,560
<i>is attractive due to the following 
features and benefits: </i>

190
00:09:55,564 --> 00:09:58,151
<i>One, it can reduce 
the CO2 emissions associated</i>

191
00:09:58,314 --> 00:10:01,739
<i>with cement production
 by about 30%, </i>

192
00:10:02,851 --> 00:10:05,951
<i>Two, it is made using limestone</i>

193
00:10:06,139 --> 00:10:08,376
<i>and low-grade clays</i>

194
00:10:08,564 --> 00:10:11,664
<i> that are in abundant supply 
and tend to be readily available.</i>

195
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,075
<i>Three, it is cost effective</i>

196
00:10:15,275 --> 00:10:18,887
<i>and does not require
capital intensive modifications</i>

197
00:10:19,087 --> 00:10:21,212
<i> to existing cement plants. </i>

198
00:10:22,547 --> 00:10:26,497
<i>LC3 can be produced with 
existing manufacturing equipment,</i>

199
00:10:26,714 --> 00:10:30,439
<i>thus only requires a marginal 
additional investment</i>

200
00:10:30,603 --> 00:10:32,353
for the calcining equipment.

201
00:10:33,464 --> 00:10:36,602
<i>So, altogether,
this cement innovation seems</i>

202
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,689
<i>particularly suited</i>

203
00:10:38,889 --> 00:10:41,889
<i>to the developing countries
 as well,</i>

204
00:10:42,089 --> 00:10:45,952
<i>as it meets 
the criteria we mentioned before</i>

205
00:10:46,152 --> 00:10:49,877
<i>relating to cost
and sustainability.</i>

206
00:10:50,649 --> 00:10:52,412
<i>And there are
currently ongoing</i>

207
00:10:52,612 --> 00:10:56,512
<i> pilot implementation projects
in India and Cuba,</i>

208
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,283
<i>which are showing 
highly promising results</i>

209
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:03,483
<i>and are being used
to build houses, </i>

210
00:11:03,683 --> 00:11:07,345
<i>as shown in the pictures
on this slide. </i>

211
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:09,300
<i>You can obtain
more information</i>

212
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,237
<i>on this exciting project</i>

213
00:11:12,437 --> 00:11:17,075
<i>at www.lc3.ch.</i>

214
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,940
<i>In the references,
I have also included a link</i>

215
00:11:24,327 --> 00:11:21,127
<i>to another interesting
 innovative building technology.</i>

216
00:11:24,515 --> 00:11:26,540
<i>The Moladi Construction System. </i>

217
00:11:27,277 --> 00:11:29,952
At the beginning of this lecture,
I asked the question

218
00:11:30,152 --> 00:11:33,402
as to what the 2nd most consumed 
substance after water?

219
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:36,702
And I'm sure
 you have the answer by now,

220
00:11:36,902 --> 00:11:41,265
but in case you don't,
then the correct answer is:

221
00:11:42,256 --> 00:11:43,531
Concrete.

222
00:11:43,731 --> 00:11:47,043
As symbolized by the picture
you see on the slide

223
00:11:47,243 --> 00:11:50,431
which is a water tank
and a concrete house.

224
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,990
Water and shelter 
represent, perhaps,

225
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,190
the most important foundations
 of contemporary humanity!

226
00:11:58,007 --> 00:11:59,282
Goodbye.
