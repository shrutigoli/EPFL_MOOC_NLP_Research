1
00:00:13,006 --> 00:00:16,078
This session aims
to provide an overview 

2
00:00:16,278 --> 00:00:19,050
of the essential technology domain
of pharmaceuticals.

3
00:00:19,709 --> 00:00:22,753
Before we begin,
let's try and clarify a few terms

4
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:25,854
and expressions that we will
be using widely in this session.

5
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,858
What is
a pharmaceutical drug exactly?

6
00:00:29,756 --> 00:00:33,760
For the purposes of this course,
a pharmaceutical drug is any substance

7
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:39,035
or compound that is used to cure,
treat, or prevent disease.

8
00:00:39,423 --> 00:00:42,985
It may also be referred to as
a pharmaceutical product,

9
00:00:43,185 --> 00:00:46,888
medicine, medication,
or simply a drug. 


10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,221
We can distinguish between
two broad categories of drugs,

11
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:54,550
based on the manner in which
they are produced and administered.

12
00:00:54,999 --> 00:00:58,135
Small-molecule drugs
are low-molecular weight compounds

13
00:00:58,335 --> 00:01:02,252
that are chemically synthesized
and then formulated into a tablet

14
00:01:02,452 --> 00:01:05,476
that is given orally to the patient,

15
00:01:06,193 --> 00:01:09,406
whereas biological drugs
or biologicals 

16
00:01:09,606 --> 00:01:13,867
are high-molecular polypeptides,
proteins and antibodies

17
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:17,796
that are produced via
biotechnological or recombinant means,

18
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:21,415
and are typically administered
by injection.

19
00:01:22,181 --> 00:01:24,804
How are pharmaceutical drugs
developed?

20
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:27,747
For simplicity, we can consider
the drug development process

21
00:01:27,947 --> 00:01:30,953
to be divided into 3 broad stages:

22
00:01:31,597 --> 00:01:33,555
It starts with
Preclinical Development,

23
00:01:33,755 --> 00:01:36,193
which essentially occurs entirely
in the laboratories,

24
00:01:36,393 --> 00:01:38,897
in order to eventually produce
what is termed

25
00:01:39,097 --> 00:01:41,358
a New Chemical Entity or NCE.

26
00:01:42,128 --> 00:01:45,134
This is then followed by
the Clinical Development stage,

27
00:01:45,334 --> 00:01:48,696
 which primarily occurs
in hospitals and clinics.

28
00:01:49,193 --> 00:01:51,575
It essentially involves
testing the NCE

29
00:01:51,775 --> 00:01:54,775
from the Preclinical Stage in humans

30
00:01:54,975 --> 00:01:58,702
for Safety and Efficacy
against the intended

31
00:01:58,902 --> 00:02:01,376
disease or diseases.

32
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:04,546
At this stage,
the NCE is now referred to

33
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:07,533
as the Investigational New Drug
or IND

34
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:11,308
upon approval
by a suitably accredited

35
00:02:11,533 --> 00:02:14,242
national or regional regulatory body,

36
00:02:14,424 --> 00:02:17,766
such as the Food
and Drug Administration or FDA

37
00:02:17,966 --> 00:02:18,748
in the US

38
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:22,725
and the European Medicines
Association or EMA in Europe.

39
00:02:22,925 --> 00:02:25,277
If the Clinical Development stage
goes well

40
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:27,650
and the clinical trials
are successful

41
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:33,010
a New Drug Approval is granted,
which leads to the final stage,

42
00:02:33,223 --> 00:02:39,759
that is a Branded Product and the
post-approval and marketing phase.

43
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:43,557
Now, the time it takes from
the commencement

44
00:02:43,757 --> 00:02:46,982
of Preclinical Development
to the Approval of a new drug

45
00:02:47,182 --> 00:02:53,498
is about ten to fifteen years, and
costs about 2.6 billion US dollars,

46
00:02:53,698 --> 00:02:55,888
based on the last study, in 2014,

47
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:59,511
from the Tufts Center
for the Study of Drug Development. 

48
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:04,587
So, the development of a new drug
is lengthy and very expensive, 

49
00:03:04,787 --> 00:03:09,042
but also a highly inefficient process
with very low success rates.

50
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,728
Given the high costs
of drug development,

51
00:03:12,928 --> 00:03:15,491
prior to the start
of the Drug Development Process,

52
00:03:15,679 --> 00:03:19,448
a patent that protects the drug
is then filed. 

53
00:03:19,648 --> 00:03:23,150
This patent is valid for twenty years,
afterwhich the drug becomes available

54
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:26,864
to any other parties who may wish
to produce and market a copy

55
00:03:27,064 --> 00:03:29,737
or generic version of the drug,

56
00:03:30,714 --> 00:03:33,373
usually at a lower price
than the branded product.

57
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:36,385
Consequently, most of the leading
pharmaceutical companies

58
00:03:36,597 --> 00:03:39,202
from developing countries
are primarily involved

59
00:03:39,402 --> 00:03:42,218
with the manufacture
of generic pharmaceutical products

60
00:03:42,418 --> 00:03:45,302
rather than the development
of new drugs entirely.

61
00:03:45,502 --> 00:03:50,538
Thus, the development of new drugs
is almost exclusively confined

62
00:03:50,738 --> 00:03:53,383
 to companies in the highly
industrialized countries, such as 

63
00:03:53,636 --> 00:03:56,183
the US,
Western Europe and Japan.

64
00:03:57,015 --> 00:04:00,335
This also inherently implies
that most of the available drugs

65
00:04:00,535 --> 00:04:03,381
are mostly tailored
for those populations

66
00:04:03,581 --> 00:04:07,323
and often less adapted
to the rest of the world population,

67
00:04:07,523 --> 00:04:10,170
especially developing countries.

68
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:15,520
Since the creation of the modern
Food and Drug Administration in 1938,

69
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,720
there is almost 1.500 drugs
that have been approved.

70
00:04:19,422 --> 00:04:22,063
Therefore, for any country wishing
to establish a repertoire

71
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:25,393
of essential medicines
that the country must aim to have,

72
00:04:25,593 --> 00:04:28,869
in order to ensure adequately
meeting national medical needs,

73
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:32,237
choosing which medicines to prioritize
can be a significant challenge,

74
00:04:32,437 --> 00:04:35,795
especially if lacking the suitable
expertise for such a task. 

75
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:42,014
In order to confront this challenge,
the World Health Organisation or WHO

76
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:45,417
judiciously assembled
an Essential Medicines List. 

77
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:48,645
And WHO defines Essential Medicines

78
00:04:48,845 --> 00:04:51,695
as those medicines
or pharmaceutical products

79
00:04:51,945 --> 00:04:55,883
that satisfy the priority
health care needs of the population.

80
00:04:56,547 --> 00:04:58,911
They are selected
with due consideration

81
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:00,808
to public health relevance,

82
00:05:01,008 --> 00:05:06,053
their safety and efficacy,
and cost-competitiveness.

83
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:10,929
In other words, essential medicines
are intended to be available

84
00:05:11,129 --> 00:05:14,971
within the context of functional
health systems at all times

85
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:19,165
in adequate amounts,
in the appropriate dosage forms,

86
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:22,372
with assured quality
and adequate information,

87
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:27,227
and at a price the individual
and the community can afford. 

88
00:05:28,606 --> 00:05:31,782
Thus, the Essential Medicines List
aims to serve

89
00:05:31,982 --> 00:05:35,792
as a Model Medicines List
or some sort of template 

90
00:05:35,992 --> 00:05:37,366
that countries can then adapt

91
00:05:37,566 --> 00:05:40,498
and develop their own national
Essential Medicines Lists. 

92
00:05:41,183 --> 00:05:47,044
It can assist national decision-makers
in reducing costs by helping them

93
00:05:47,244 --> 00:05:50,826
identify priority medicines
to meet their country’s health needs.

94
00:05:51,447 --> 00:05:53,264
And in, in high-income countries,

95
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:56,563
the list helps to provide
insurance companies, for example,

96
00:05:56,076 --> 00:05:59,076


97
00:05:56,763 --> 00:06:01,876
with a neutral,
gold-standard list for reimbursement.

98
00:06:03,156 --> 00:06:05,730
We now look at
the link between poverty,

99
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:07,948
disease and access
to essential medicines.

100
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:11,672
This slide shows that
the countries with the lowest 

101
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:15,615
per capita health expenditure,
indicated in red and dark red,

102
00:06:15,815 --> 00:06:18,753
are also some of the poorest
countries in the world. 

103
00:06:18,953 --> 00:06:21,791
Pharmaceuticals account
for up to 30%

104
00:06:21,991 --> 00:06:24,558
of health expenditures
in transitional economies,

105
00:06:24,758 --> 00:06:31,231
while this figure rises to as high
as 66% in low income countries.

106
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:35,165
Clearly, a lower per capita
expenditure on health,

107
00:06:35,365 --> 00:06:39,289
implies less
availability of essential medicines.

108
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:42,808
 Interestingly,
according to the WHO,

109
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:45,850
 a previous survey
carried out in Uganda

110
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:50,251
showed that for certain nationally
listed essential medicines, 

111
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:54,823
out-of-pocket prices for patients
were over thirteen times higher

112
00:06:55,036 --> 00:06:58,273
for branded products than
the international pricing reference.

113
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:01,872
And even for generics,
the prices were still almost

114
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:04,718
three times higher
than the international reference.

115
00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:08,785
This is clearly a surprising
finding, and reveals a vicious cycle,

116
00:07:08,985 --> 00:07:13,697
where the Poor will simply
get poorer and sicker.

117
00:07:13,897 --> 00:07:17,653
Besides the general diseases
that tend to affect the whole world,

118
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:22,816
in general, tropical and subtropical
regions have additional diseases

119
00:07:23,016 --> 00:07:25,855
 that are particularly endemic
in those regions,

120
00:07:26,055 --> 00:07:30,987
 collectively known as the Neglected
Tropical Diseases or NTDs.

121
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:36,814
The term “neglected” highlights
the fact that the diseases affect

122
00:07:37,014 --> 00:07:41,239
mainly poor and marginalized
populations in low-resource settings. 

123
00:07:41,439 --> 00:07:44,891
NTDs are a diverse group
of communicable diseases

124
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:47,559
that prevail in tropical and
subtropical conditions

125
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,843
in over 149 countries.

126
00:07:50,449 --> 00:07:53,125
They affect more than
1.4 billion people,

127
00:07:53,325 --> 00:07:55,754
 including more than
500 million children,

128
00:07:55,954 --> 00:07:59,228
costing developing economies
billions of dollars every year.

129
00:07:59,936 --> 00:08:04,150
These diseases are to be contrasted
with the big three diseases,

130
00:08:04,350 --> 00:08:07,359
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria,

131
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:12,167
which, relatively speaking, receive
greater treatment and research funding.

132
00:08:12,367 --> 00:08:16,156
There are about seventeen
neglected tropical diseases,

133
00:08:16,356 --> 00:08:19,802
and examples include: chagas,
dengue and chikungunya,

134
00:08:20,002 --> 00:08:22,426
sleeping sickness, and trachoma.

135
00:08:23,201 --> 00:08:27,858
NTDs thrive in areas where
there is lack of basic sanitation.

136
00:08:28,744 --> 00:08:31,829
Thus, Water, Sanitation
and Hygiene services

137
00:08:32,042 --> 00:08:34,375
are also critical to care
for the people

138
00:08:34,575 --> 00:08:36,278
who have many of these diseases,

139
00:08:36,478 --> 00:08:38,852
and for accelerating
and sustaining progress

140
00:08:39,064 --> 00:08:41,404
on neglected tropical diseases
overall.

141
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,900
Besides infectious diseases,

142
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:47,633
an emerging and potentially greater
health challenge

143
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:51,560
is in the form of Non-communicable
diseases or NCDs

144
00:08:52,483 --> 00:08:56,162
NCDs account for 63% of all deaths,

145
00:08:56,362 --> 00:09:00,498
that is 36 million out of
57 million global deaths.

146
00:09:00,698 --> 00:09:05,095
And 80% of NCD deaths occur in
low and middle-income countries. 

147
00:09:05,295 --> 00:09:08,137
So, NCDs are not only
a health problem

148
00:09:08,325 --> 00:09:10,647
but a development challenge as well.

149
00:09:11,353 --> 00:09:13,822
Within the NCDs,
cardiovascular and mental health

150
00:09:14,022 --> 00:09:16,535
are increasingly posing
immense challenges.

151
00:09:17,226 --> 00:09:18,975
Within cardio-vascular diseases, 

152
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:22,029
Type 2 diabetes is increasing
at an alarming rate. 

153
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:24,387
The number of people
with Type 2 diabetes 

154
00:09:24,587 --> 00:09:30,845
has risen from 108 million in 1980
to 422 million in 2014.

155
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,469
In particular, diabetes prevalence 

156
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:37,099
has been rising more rapidly
in middle and low-income countries.

157
00:09:37,299 --> 00:09:40,604
Diabetes is one of the leading
causes of death today, in fact,

158
00:09:40,854 --> 00:09:43,624
and the majority of these deaths
indeed occur

159
00:09:43,824 --> 00:09:46,113
in low and middle income countries.

160
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:52,028
In Mental Health, Epilepsy and
Depression are particularly noteworthy.

161
00:09:52,228 --> 00:09:55,773
Epilepsy is a chronic non-
communicable disorder of the brain 

162
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:57,851
that affects people of all ages.

163
00:09:58,051 --> 00:10:01,401
Approximately 50 million
people worldwide have epilepsy, 

164
00:10:01,601 --> 00:10:05,631
making it one of the most common
neurological diseases globally.

165
00:10:06,253 --> 00:10:08,875
Nearly 80% of the people
with epilepsy 

166
00:10:09,075 --> 00:10:11,171
live in low
and middle-income countries.

167
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,787
However, about 75% of people with

168
00:10:13,987 --> 00:10:17,171
epilepsy in low
and middle- income countries,

169
00:10:17,371 --> 00:10:19,433
do not get the treatment they need.

170
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:24,969
Another mental health disease
of high significance is Depression.

171
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:28,481
According to WHO,

172
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:31,794
depression is the leading cause
of disability worldwide,

173
00:10:31,994 --> 00:10:36,221
and is a major contributor to the
overall global burden of disease.

174
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:40,520
It affects around 350 million
people worldwide

175
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,925
and this number
is projected to increase.

176
00:10:43,736 --> 00:10:46,050
Fewer than half
of those people affected

177
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:50,297
have access to adequate treatment
and health care.

178
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:53,781
The issue of improving access
to essential medicines

179
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:57,890
to developing countries is a massive
and multi-factorial challenge.

180
00:10:59,143 --> 00:11:03,299
And one of the biggest issues
remains economic:

181
00:11:03,499 --> 00:11:05,401
cost & affordability.

182
00:11:06,287 --> 00:11:10,154
But even if the budget for medicines
is available sometimes,

183
00:11:10,379 --> 00:11:12,850
other factors may undermine
the ultimate mission of access

184
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:14,185


185
00:11:15,453 --> 00:11:20,851
Such factors may include fake medicines
and lack of suitable infrastructure,

186
00:11:21,051 --> 00:11:25,153
 for example, such as
cold chain for vaccines.

187
00:11:25,644 --> 00:11:29,738
Fake medicines account for almost
a third of medicines in Africa.

188
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:34,253
One study, published by the American
Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene,

189
00:11:34,453 --> 00:11:38,947
found that in just one year,
fake and poorly made malaria drugs

190
00:11:39,147 --> 00:11:44,110
contributed to the deaths of more
than 100,000 children across Africa.

191
00:11:45,308 --> 00:11:47,968
The British think-tank,
International Policy Network, 

192
00:11:48,168 --> 00:11:51,917
estimates that, globally,
700,000 deaths a year 

193
00:11:52,117 --> 00:11:55,604
are caused by fake malaria
and tuberculosis drugs.

194
00:11:56,314 --> 00:11:58,340
Now, a company from Ghana,
mPedigree, 

195
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:01,518
has been hard at work
to tackle this serious problem.

196
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:02,988
How does it work? 

197
00:12:03,685 --> 00:12:06,825
Pharmaceutical manufacturers
can sign up

198
00:12:07,025 --> 00:12:09,382
on to the mPedigree scheme platform,

199
00:12:10,223 --> 00:12:13,509
where they can upload the
pedigree information 

200
00:12:13,709 --> 00:12:16,280
of each pack of medicine
into the central registry.

201
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,185
When consumers buy a product made by

202
00:12:19,385 --> 00:12:21,957
a manufacturer participating
in the scheme,

203
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:24,508
they are able to query
the pedigree information

204
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:28,823
stored in the registry
by means of a free SMS message. 

205
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:32,306
An automatic response
from the registry 

206
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:34,743
certifies whether
the particular product 

207
00:12:34,943 --> 00:12:36,817
is truly "from source" or not.

208
00:12:37,447 --> 00:12:40,581
Today,
mPedigree claims it has labels

209
00:12:40,781 --> 00:12:44,468
on more
than 500 million drug packets.

210
00:12:45,053 --> 00:12:47,742
And Clients also include
giant drug companies, 

211
00:12:47,942 --> 00:12:52,000
such as AstraZeneca,
Roche, and Sanofi, and more

212
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:55,668
There are various other technology
initiatives that promise to improve,

213
00:12:55,868 --> 00:12:59,531
access to much needed essential
medicines, which we cannot cover,

214
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:02,269
unfortunately, during this lecture,
due to time constraints.

215
00:13:02,584 --> 00:13:05,813
However, references for further
reading have been provided at the end

216
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:09,004
and they cover other initiatives
to fight fake drugs, 

217
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:14,735
to provide cold chain to ensure safe
access to vaccines and, and more.

218
00:13:16,283 --> 00:13:19,216
This now brings us
to the end of this lecture.

219
00:13:19,836 --> 00:13:20,900
Good-bye.
