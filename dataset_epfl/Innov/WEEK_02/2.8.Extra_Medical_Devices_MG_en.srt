1
00:00:09,984 --> 00:00:13,991
Electrical energy is the primary
problem,

2
00:00:14,922 --> 00:00:16,897
the energy is insufficient.

3
00:00:17,092 --> 00:00:20,374
which leads to recurrent power cuts

4
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:23,707
and from these power cuts,

5
00:00:24,143 --> 00:00:27,627
there are voltage variations 
when it is turned back on

6
00:00:27,947 --> 00:00:33,117
and a lot of expensive 
devices are damaged.

7
00:00:33,417 --> 00:00:36,780
So that is the first issue.

8
00:00:36,965 --> 00:00:40,730
Once we lost 
at the same time

9
00:00:41,785 --> 00:00:44,934
the water pump, that supplies 
the water tower,

10
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:49,080
because the power generator had
been overloaded

11
00:00:49,631 --> 00:00:53,968
and it started delivering
over 600V,

12
00:00:54,587 --> 00:00:58,708
it damaged a lot of
hospital equipment,

13
00:00:59,011 --> 00:01:01,761
even the x-ray machine 
was damaged.

14
00:01:02,346 --> 00:01:05,900
So the primary problem 
is energy.

15
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:09,684
It causes multiple
machines to break down

16
00:01:10,681 --> 00:01:13,848
the oxygen extractors
are burnt out,

17
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:16,377
incubators are burnt out,

18
00:01:16,648 --> 00:01:20,569
but equally in the 
post-mortem service,

19
00:01:21,304 --> 00:01:22,784
there are recurring break-downs

20
00:01:22,955 --> 00:01:26,678
because of the fluctuation 
problems with electric energy

21
00:01:27,225 --> 00:01:30,756
And it is the same for the equipment:

22
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:33,861
lamps among others,
burn out often

23
00:01:34,036 --> 00:01:38,589
and that is an added 
cost for the hospital upkeep.

24
00:01:38,772 --> 00:01:40,652
So, it's not easy!

25
00:01:41,385 --> 00:01:44,716
When I got to this hospital,
the power generator didn't work

26
00:01:45,396 --> 00:01:48,106
and even today there is a failure
with this generator

27
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:50,386
I haven't been able to find
the right part for 2 weeks.

28
00:01:51,843 --> 00:01:54,770
So in terms of power cuts

29
00:01:54,966 --> 00:01:59,659
we
really need to find it.

30
00:02:01,697 --> 00:02:03,457
because, considering 
our resources

31
00:02:03,657 --> 00:02:07,497
I cannot buy the brand new part.

32
00:02:08,309 --> 00:02:10,629
It costs around a million,

33
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,330
so I am hesitant,

34
00:02:14,525 --> 00:02:17,410
I am getting people to look

35
00:02:17,592 --> 00:02:19,705
on the second-hand market

36
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:22,844
if we can find something,
it will be that!

37
00:02:24,916 --> 00:02:28,360
The most tenacious
and recurrent problems

38
00:02:29,439 --> 00:02:33,541
from our point of view is,

39
00:02:33,715 --> 00:02:37,103
the unavailability of 
electric energy

40
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,860
the series of consequences 
is imaginable

41
00:02:44,112 --> 00:02:49,204
even by someone who
doesn't work at the hospital

42
00:02:49,431 --> 00:02:53,576
and who came to be 
treated at the hospital.

43
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:57,414
When there was a power cut,

44
00:02:58,092 --> 00:03:00,554
the machines are fragile

45
00:03:00,732 --> 00:03:03,182
and can break down.

46
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:04,706
From this point of view,

47
00:03:04,894 --> 00:03:07,464
there are statistics provided
by institutions

48
00:03:07,638 --> 00:03:13,225
like the World Health Organisation
or the World Bank

49
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:19,317
Even a lot of hospitals are
not connected

50
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:23,587
to this source, before we even talk
about availability problems.

51
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:29,886
So the diagnostic devices
are weakened

52
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:34,611
there are for example
preservation chains

53
00:03:34,814 --> 00:03:38,600
for products, for reagents,
that can be broken

54
00:03:38,966 --> 00:03:41,920
and you would thus lose
these reagents

55
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:45,822
and you can lose the
machines as well,

56
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:48,553
not to mention a pending analysis

57
00:03:48,738 --> 00:03:52,351
and when there is no more electricity,
the consequences are imaginable

58
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,872
by everyone.

59
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:58,612
You see the work done
by CURES for example

60
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,328
at the University Research Center
for Energy in Healthcare

61
00:04:01,505 --> 00:04:03,863
at the National Advanced School 
of Engineering

62
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:07,034
is trying to address a major issue

63
00:04:07,190 --> 00:04:09,248
in the district hospitals,

64
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,857
The energy and the 
quality of the energy,

65
00:04:11,044 --> 00:04:15,337
we know that a lot in the quality 
of the service

66
00:04:15,544 --> 00:04:17,544
depends on the quality of the energy.

67
00:04:18,022 --> 00:04:21,035
And innovative solutions 
are being researched at the moment

68
00:04:21,356 --> 00:04:24,818
in this research center to 
really bring

69
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:28,826
something revolutionary to 
our environment

70
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:32,282
even if that seems 
unimportant in other environments

71
00:04:32,617 --> 00:04:33,731
but we are here

72
00:04:33,917 --> 00:04:36,166
and we need these revolutionary
solutions,

73
00:04:36,354 --> 00:04:37,768
locally revolutionary

74
00:04:37,968 --> 00:04:40,580
that allow us to 
keep a good quality of service

75
00:04:40,756 --> 00:04:44,286
the quality and functionality
of the equipment,

76
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:46,139
and the sustainability
of these equipment

77
00:04:46,449 --> 00:04:48,913
and in the end save money, in the
long term,

78
00:04:49,101 --> 00:04:50,838
for the whole country.

79
00:04:51,023 --> 00:04:53,998
That is what this 
research center is for.
