00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,440
Hello.
This lady in Cameroon

2
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,426
has to go fetch water at the river
for her laundry.

3
00:00:20,994 --> 00:00:22,847
She doesn't have access
to clean water,

4
00:00:23,257 --> 00:00:25,931
nor does she have access
to basic sanitation.

5
00:00:27,229 --> 00:00:30,070
In this video, we will speak
about the vast domain

6
00:00:30,145 --> 00:00:32,220
of water and sanitation technologies.

7
00:00:32,482 --> 00:00:36,999
Access to enough safe water
is a precondition to human existence

8
00:00:37,324 --> 00:00:39,576
and technologies
that help provide it

9
00:00:39,676 --> 00:00:41,154
are indeed essential.

10
00:00:41,254 --> 00:00:44,254


11
00:00:41,485 --> 00:00:44,598
By the time water has been used
by humans, however, 

12
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:48,478
it will be loaded with all sorts
of household or industrial waste.

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,243
It will thus need
to be properly cleansed

14
00:00:51,343 --> 00:00:54,754
before it can be safely discharged
into the environment.

15
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:57,712
That is the role
of sanitation technologies

16
00:00:57,812 --> 00:00:59,240
as we will see.

17
00:00:59,876 --> 00:01:02,565
Water is so closely linked
to development

18
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:06,178
that, for the SDGs, 
one specific objective

19
00:01:06,208 --> 00:01:09,995
has been defined just for water,
Objective Number 6.

20
00:01:10,414 --> 00:01:13,101
However, water
and sanitation technologies

21
00:01:13,176 --> 00:01:17,599
have also an important influence
on almost all the other objectives.

22
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:20,711
Take, for example,
Objective Number 3, "Good Health":

23
00:01:21,603 --> 00:01:26,804
waterborne disease causes
over 840,000 deaths each year

24
00:01:26,904 --> 00:01:31,592
from diarrhea, with almost half
of them being children under five,

25
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:36,718
as a result of unsafe drinking-water,
inadequate sanitation and hygiene.

26
00:01:37,285 --> 00:01:41,423
A study by the World Health Organization
in 2012 calculated

27
00:01:41,523 --> 00:01:44,201
that for every one dollar invested
in sanitation,

28
00:01:44,301 --> 00:01:48,722
there was a return of $5.50
in lower health care costs,

29
00:01:48,822 --> 00:01:51,628
more productivity
and fewer premature deaths.

30
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,728
Water is also 
crucially important for food,

31
00:01:54,776 --> 00:01:57,498
which is our sustainable 
development goal number two.

32
00:01:58,001 --> 00:02:01,580
Agriculture accounts for 70% 
of all water withdrawn

33
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,094
by the agricultural, municipal
and industrial sectors.

34
00:02:05,588 --> 00:02:09,318
Before we talk about technologies
related to water and sanitation,

35
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:14,260
we need to briefly tell you
about the hydrological or water cycle.

36
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:18,338
In a very simplified view,
the water cycle describes

37
00:02:18,388 --> 00:02:21,828
how water moves on earth,
above earth and below earth.

38
00:02:22,396 --> 00:02:25,844
The sun drives the cycle
by heating and evaporating water

39
00:02:25,944 --> 00:02:28,464
from the oceans
and from lakes and streams.

40
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:32,740
Water is also transpired by plants
and evaporated by the soil.

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,337
As the water molecule is less dense
than other atmospheric components,

42
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:39,694
the vapor will rise and cool down

43
00:02:39,794 --> 00:02:42,535
as the pressure is reduced
at higher altitudes.

44
00:02:42,635 --> 00:02:46,746
It then condenses and falls back
on earth in the form of precipitation

45
00:02:46,846 --> 00:02:48,656
which can be rain or snow.

46
00:02:48,756 --> 00:02:51,907
It can then accumulate
as ice caps or glaciers

47
00:02:52,007 --> 00:02:54,478
and remain stored there
for thousands of years.

48
00:02:54,628 --> 00:02:58,204
Some of the rain will flow directly
as surface runoff

49
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:00,827
and form stream and rivers
which will, in turn,

50
00:03:00,927 --> 00:03:03,625
replenish lakes and flow back
to the ocean.

51
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:07,599
Another fraction of the rain
will soak the ground,

52
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,919
where it will
replenish the groundwater.

53
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:13,841
Groundwater will sometimes find
openings in the land surface

54
00:03:13,941 --> 00:03:16,241
and come out
as freshwater springs.

55
00:03:16,603 --> 00:03:20,320
Human activity will generate
a second, smaller cycle,

56
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:23,528
where water pumped from the ground
or from a river

57
00:03:23,628 --> 00:03:27,067
is used by humans for drinking,
for flushing the toilets,

58
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:30,115
or for irrigation in agriculture
or in industry.

59
00:03:30,737 --> 00:03:34,028
Often, it will get loaded
with impurities and waste

60
00:03:34,128 --> 00:03:35,016
in the process.

61
00:03:35,065 --> 00:03:38,325
It is then ideally treated
and eventually discharged

62
00:03:38,425 --> 00:03:40,308
back into the natural water cycle.

63
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:44,340
We will now take a closer look
at some essential technologies

64
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,569
involved in this human segment
of the water cycle.

65
00:03:48,007 --> 00:03:51,065
There are many technologies
allowing to catch water,

66
00:03:51,165 --> 00:03:53,946
which obviously depends
on the source itself.

67
00:03:54,046 --> 00:03:57,368
One such technology
is the water well.

68
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,822
A well will allow you to get access
to water that has percolated

69
00:04:01,922 --> 00:04:05,602
through the ground and is stored
in the so-called "aquifer".

70
00:04:05,702 --> 00:04:09,458
An aquifer is
a porous underground layer

71
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,008
saturated with water.

72
00:04:11,258 --> 00:04:13,570
Water then needs to be retrieved.

73
00:04:13,783 --> 00:04:16,486
There are simple mechanical ways
to do that,

74
00:04:16,586 --> 00:04:18,589
such as a mechanical hand-pump.

75
00:04:19,162 --> 00:04:23,082
Pumps can be electrically powered,
for example, with solar panels.

76
00:04:23,558 --> 00:04:26,700
The well can be susceptible
to yield fluctuations

77
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,512
and there are technologies
which allow to monitor

78
00:04:29,562 --> 00:04:31,809
and optimize the water use.

79
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:35,664
Then, water needs to be transported
in a safe and hygienic way

80
00:04:35,764 --> 00:04:39,076
and stored so that
it can be used on demand.

81
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:44,274
Generally, water from any source
will contain unwanted components.

82
00:04:44,374 --> 00:04:47,005
For example, a well
can be contaminated

83
00:04:47,105 --> 00:04:50,757
by a pit latrine located nearby,
as we will see.

84
00:04:51,684 --> 00:04:55,531
It will thus need to be treated
before it can be safely used

85
00:04:55,631 --> 00:04:57,131
for human consumption.

86
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:00,985
Here, you can see a reverse-osmosis
water treatment plant

87
00:05:01,085 --> 00:05:04,527
serving a town 
of roughly 10,000 people in Iraq.

88
00:05:05,428 --> 00:05:09,274
There are many different technologies
to remove living pathogens

89
00:05:09,374 --> 00:05:11,567
such as bacteria or parasites,

90
00:05:11,667 --> 00:05:15,568
or unwanted dissolved chemicals
such as arsenic,

91
00:05:15,668 --> 00:05:17,218
or simply dissolved salt.

92
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:21,354
Depending on the available water quality,
the choice will be made

93
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,959
between the different options

94
00:05:23,259 --> 00:05:28,034
such as filtration, ultra-filtration
or reverse osmosis.

95
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:31,728
UV light can also be used
to kill bacteria.

96
00:05:32,411 --> 00:05:36,387
These water purification technologies
are sometimes quite expensive, though,

97
00:05:36,487 --> 00:05:39,646
and complex to set up
and maintain in proper function.

98
00:05:40,787 --> 00:05:43,300
Water also needs
to be transported.

99
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,988
Unfortunately, quite
a large quantity

100
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:48,537
is often lost in the process.

101
00:05:48,637 --> 00:05:51,971
There are sophisticated technologies
to detect leakages,

102
00:05:52,071 --> 00:05:55,603
which is very important
to maximize the availability

103
00:05:55,703 --> 00:05:57,093
of this precious liquid.

104
00:05:57,984 --> 00:06:00,630
Once water has been purified,
there is a risk

105
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,297
that it won't remain safe.

106
00:06:02,397 --> 00:06:06,471
Usually, the addition of chlorine
will allow  to keep it protected

107
00:06:06,571 --> 00:06:08,343
against germs for a while.

108
00:06:08,954 --> 00:06:13,195
There are technologies that allow
an automated dosage of this chlorine.

109
00:06:14,033 --> 00:06:17,014
Yet another set
of important water technologies

110
00:06:17,114 --> 00:06:20,324
allow to assess the quality
of the obtained water.

111
00:06:20,424 --> 00:06:22,338
Here, you can see a team

112
00:06:22,438 --> 00:06:25,424
from the International Committee
of the Red Cross in Sudan

113
00:06:25,524 --> 00:06:27,980
assessing the level
of chlorine in water

114
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,111
with a very simple pool test.

115
00:06:30,645 --> 00:06:34,472
Water quality assessments
can involve multiple parameters,

116
00:06:34,572 --> 00:06:38,615
which can be monitored with a variety
of technical instruments,

117
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:42,555
such as a spectrophotometer,
which allows to analyze

118
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:44,771
the chemical composition
of the water.

119
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:47,591
There are many more technologies
related to water.

120
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:51,001
However, drinking water technologies
is just one segment

121
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:54,323
in the cycle which includes also
sanitation, hygiene,

122
00:06:54,423 --> 00:06:56,289
as well as waste management.

123
00:06:56,389 --> 00:06:59,521
Let us look at a few
sanitation technologies.

124
00:07:00,372 --> 00:07:03,151
The toilet is really
an essential technology!

125
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:08,188
Here, you can see migrants in Mexico
cleaning the latrines in a shelter

126
00:07:08,271 --> 00:07:10,107
before continuing their trip.

127
00:07:10,207 --> 00:07:13,768
There are several modes
by which human excreta

128
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:16,489
can be collected
in a safe and hygienic way.

129
00:07:17,430 --> 00:07:21,334
What happens with the excreta next
is an important question

130
00:07:21,434 --> 00:07:25,182
as it will have to be stored,
transported, treated

131
00:07:25,282 --> 00:07:28,107
and disposed of
in a safe and convenient way.

132
00:07:29,534 --> 00:07:32,543
In many cases,
mainly in rural environments,

133
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:35,498
it is simply stored in the pit
under the latrine.

134
00:07:35,598 --> 00:07:38,598
When the pit is full, it is closed
and the latrine is moved

135
00:07:38,678 --> 00:07:40,712
to another place with a new pit.

136
00:07:41,392 --> 00:07:45,970
This will often raise concerns
about pathogens infiltrating

137
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,271
the groundwater.

138
00:07:47,878 --> 00:07:51,078
Generally, in fact, human waste is -
or should be -

139
00:07:51,178 --> 00:07:53,234
transported to a wastewater
treatment plant,

140
00:07:53,309 --> 00:07:55,135
such as the one shown here.

141
00:07:55,335 --> 00:07:58,575
In this plant, it undergoes
a series of treatments

142
00:07:58,775 --> 00:08:01,632
until it can be safely released
into the environment

143
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,973
or utilized as fertilizer.

144
00:08:04,261 --> 00:08:08,208
In cities of industrialized countries,
sewage systems will be used

145
00:08:08,308 --> 00:08:11,083
to transport the water
to the treatment plants.

146
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:15,421
However, this solution is expensive
to build and maintain,

147
00:08:15,521 --> 00:08:19,692
and might be very complex to apply
in poor areas such as slums.

148
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:24,025
Fecal waste can also be put to use
to generate biogas

149
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,776
in a "digester",
such as the one you see here

150
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:29,716
under construction in Zimbabwe.

151
00:08:29,816 --> 00:08:32,603
Biogas can then be used
as an energy source,

152
00:08:32,623 --> 00:08:33,935
for example, for cooking.

153
00:08:34,655 --> 00:08:38,222
We now understand the importance
of water and sanitation technologies,

154
00:08:38,322 --> 00:08:41,560
but how widely available
are they on a global scale?

155
00:08:41,660 --> 00:08:42,823
Let's have a look.

156
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:46,679
Global water scarcity
is a crucial problem,

157
00:08:46,742 --> 00:08:49,456
which is made worse by demographics
and climate change.

158
00:08:49,956 --> 00:08:53,483
Water quality is also a big problem
as we can see in this map

159
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,559
which shows the percentage
of population having access

160
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:58,828
to  "improved" water sources.

161
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:03,912
Improved water sources are defined
as those which adequately protect

162
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:08,589
the source from outside contamination,
particularly fecal matter.

163
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,202
For example, a well without
a sealed protective top cover

164
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:15,491
is not an improved water source.

165
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:20,175
As you can see,
there are still 660 million people

166
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:24,122
who do not have access
to such improved water sources at all.

167
00:09:24,613 --> 00:09:26,915
Having access 
to an improved water source

168
00:09:27,015 --> 00:09:28,971
doesn't mean it is safe.

169
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:32,196
The World Health Organization
estimates that, globally,

170
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:36,791
at least 1.8 billion people
use a drinking-water source

171
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:39,010
which is contaminated with feces.

172
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,620
Having piped water is often
not an assurance of quality either,

173
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:46,620
since a substantial proportion
of water supplied

174
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,635
through pipes is contaminated.

175
00:09:48,923 --> 00:09:52,453
This is especially true
where water supply is intermittent,

176
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:53,955
treatment is inadequate,

177
00:09:54,055 --> 00:09:56,688
or when proper sanitation
isn't available.

178
00:09:56,788 --> 00:09:59,924
Let's look at the global access
to sanitation.

179
00:10:01,161 --> 00:10:04,192
This map shows the percentage
of global population

180
00:10:04,292 --> 00:10:07,669
which has access
to "improved" sanitation facilities.

181
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:11,382
"Improved" sanitation means
that the facility is able

182
00:10:11,482 --> 00:10:15,412
to hygienically separate
human excreta from human contact.

183
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,230
According to the
World Health Organization,

184
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:21,791
in 2015, one third
of the world's population

185
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:25,500
had no access to such
improved sanitation facilities.

186
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:30,018
Of those, almost half -
or 950 million people - 

187
00:10:30,118 --> 00:10:33,815
still have to defecate in the open,
for example in street gutters,

188
00:10:33,915 --> 00:10:36,983
behind bushes,
or into open bodies of water.

189
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:41,684
This perpetuates a vicious circle
of disease and poverty,

190
00:10:41,784 --> 00:10:44,194
where people get re-infected
again and again,

191
00:10:44,294 --> 00:10:47,195
by pathogens present
in the population.

192
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,945
Benefits of improved sanitation
extend well beyond

193
00:10:50,995 --> 00:10:52,709
reducing the risk of diarrhea.

194
00:10:52,897 --> 00:10:55,441
It promotes dignity
and boosts safety,

195
00:10:55,541 --> 00:10:57,883
particularly among women and girls.

196
00:10:58,380 --> 00:11:01,656
School attendance is also improved,
especially for girls,

197
00:11:01,756 --> 00:11:04,728
with the provision
of separate sanitary facilities.

198
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:07,463
As you can see,
we need innovative solutions

199
00:11:07,563 --> 00:11:10,266
for both provision
of safe drinking water

200
00:11:10,366 --> 00:11:12,282
and adequate sanitation.

201
00:11:12,565 --> 00:11:14,462
I would like to conclude
by telling you

202
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,554
about an innovation
that was developed

203
00:11:16,654 --> 00:11:20,512
to solve the problem of access
to toilets in the poorest countries.

204
00:11:21,134 --> 00:11:24,397
The Blue Diversion Toilet
is an ambitious project

205
00:11:24,447 --> 00:11:25,877
conducted by a team

206
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:29,323
at the Swiss Federal Institute
of Aquatic Science and Technology,

207
00:11:29,423 --> 00:11:33,285
a design company EOS,
the Paul Scherrer Institute,

208
00:11:33,348 --> 00:11:34,795
and several other partners,

209
00:11:34,878 --> 00:11:37,914
with funding from the
Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

210
00:11:38,014 --> 00:11:40,980
It works without the need
for grid electricity,

211
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:45,278
nor running water, and was developed
for the context of urban slums.

212
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:48,986
One of the key efforts so far
has been to design it

213
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:52,534
so that it is culturally acceptable
and appealing to people.

214
00:11:53,075 --> 00:11:56,385
This modular and sophisticated concept
also involves

215
00:11:56,485 --> 00:11:59,261
a complete self-sustainable
business model

216
00:11:59,361 --> 00:12:02,057
by which local entrepreneurs
can earn some money

217
00:12:02,157 --> 00:12:04,530
from taking care
of the installed systems.

218
00:12:04,892 --> 00:12:07,199
So, how does it work?

219
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,178
The technology separates
solid and liquid waste, or urine,

220
00:12:11,278 --> 00:12:12,552
and flush water.

221
00:12:12,652 --> 00:12:15,972
Flush water is cleaned
by ultrafiltration

222
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:18,771
and made available for re-use
inside the toilet.

223
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:22,898
Urine and sold excreta
are separately recycled

224
00:12:22,998 --> 00:12:25,561
into fertilizing products
which are then sold.

225
00:12:25,973 --> 00:12:28,414
I think this is an example
of a very interesting

226
00:12:28,514 --> 00:12:30,803
essential technology project
in a world

227
00:12:30,903 --> 00:12:34,631
where more people have mobile phones
than a toilet.

228
00:12:34,731 --> 00:12:38,259
After this short discussion
of water and sanitation technologies,

229
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:42,119
I hope you will feel motivated
to imagine and experiment

230
00:12:42,219 --> 00:12:45,980
many more inventions in this
essential technology domain.

231
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,921
Good bye.
