1
00:00:04,837 --> 00:00:05,657
All the hospitals

2
00:00:05,857 --> 00:00:06,957
should have water,

3
00:00:07,157 --> 00:00:09,305
the water
from the national supply.

4
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:12,505


5
00:00:09,505 --> 00:00:12,198
But we can't count on that water.

6
00:00:12,398 --> 00:00:14,288
so we use the wells,

7
00:00:14,671 --> 00:00:16,902
and using
mechanical pumps

8
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:19,292
it's difficult

9
00:00:19,492 --> 00:00:21,149
we have to get
the water from the ground

10
00:00:21,352 --> 00:00:22,577
before using it.

11
00:00:22,777 --> 00:00:23,916
And now,

12
00:00:24,116 --> 00:00:26,560
some hospitals have started using

13
00:00:27,327 --> 00:00:29,629
an electric pump
with the water tower.

14
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,549
And theres still the same problem

15
00:00:32,749 --> 00:00:35,648
with the quality of 
the electric energy,

16
00:00:35,848 --> 00:00:37,884
when the pumps breaks 
from time to time

17
00:00:38,084 --> 00:00:39,202
and it needs changing

18
00:00:39,402 --> 00:00:40,667
that is what happened in Mfou

19
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,307
even when we were already there

20
00:00:42,507 --> 00:00:44,282
but we also changed it 
two or three times

21
00:00:44,482 --> 00:00:48,126
and that depends on the commitment 
of the personnel and managers

22
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:50,502
and on top of that,

23
00:00:50,702 --> 00:00:52,476
the amount of revenue

24
00:00:52,676 --> 00:00:53,861
that the institute can make.

25
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:56,650
For now,

26
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,589
the hospital uses a water well

27
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:01,930
with a manual pump,

28
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:05,701
so you have to manually pump
to get water.

29
00:01:06,349 --> 00:01:10,256
And we have drills like that,

30
00:01:10,456 --> 00:01:13,822
one is very efficient

31
00:01:14,554 --> 00:01:15,842
the water is pure,

32
00:01:16,042 --> 00:01:18,772
and another that we
just restored

33
00:01:18,972 --> 00:01:20,454
because it was
also broken

34
00:01:20,654 --> 00:01:23,428
but the water is 
a bit dirty

35
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:27,244
so now there are two drills

36
00:01:27,444 --> 00:01:29,327
that the hospital uses

37
00:01:29,527 --> 00:01:31,779
and the biggest problem is

38
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,141
about this sort of drilling

39
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:37,542
is that the surrounding population

40
00:01:37,742 --> 00:01:39,399
also comes to take

41
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,751
their water here.

42
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:44,863
So we have to close

43
00:01:45,063 --> 00:01:48,581
the well that has clean water,

44
00:01:49,279 --> 00:01:52,634
in the morning, we open
between 6am and 8am

45
00:01:52,834 --> 00:01:54,596
and after, 
we must close it

46
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:59,391
and in the evening at 6pm 
till 7pm

47
00:01:58,303 --> 00:01:59,301


48
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:00,342
afterwards we close it

49
00:02:00,542 --> 00:02:04,474
so that not all the water is used

50
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:06,803
and the hospital lacks water

51
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:10,332
afterwards.

52
00:02:13,043 --> 00:02:13,876
The real problem,

53
00:02:14,076 --> 00:02:15,181
is the hygiene issues.

54
00:02:15,381 --> 00:02:16,516
That is the main problem

55
00:02:16,716 --> 00:02:19,132
the worst problem 
and the most dangerous.

56
00:02:20,759 --> 00:02:23,938
All the rooms do not
have water in them.

57
00:02:24,528 --> 00:02:25,312
That means that,

58
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:27,807
even hand cleanliness

59
00:02:28,007 --> 00:02:31,269
cannot be respected at all levels.

60
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:33,863
so we have to leave a room

61
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:36,286
to go into another room
to find a tap

62
00:02:36,498 --> 00:02:37,814
to be able to clean our hands,

63
00:02:38,014 --> 00:02:39,489
that is a real problem!

64
00:02:39,689 --> 00:02:41,155
Now, on top of that

65
00:02:41,355 --> 00:02:42,301
the toilets

66
00:02:42,501 --> 00:02:44,165
the toilets don't work.

67
00:02:44,365 --> 00:02:47,533
So that is a huge 
hygiene problem

68
00:02:47,733 --> 00:02:49,656
in the structure.

69
00:02:49,856 --> 00:02:50,793
The second problem

70
00:02:50,993 --> 00:02:52,534
is the drinking water,

71
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:54,177
there is none.

72
00:02:54,377 --> 00:02:57,257
So we have no water 
to drink

73
00:02:57,457 --> 00:02:59,797
because the drilling water
cannot be ingested.

74
00:02:59,997 --> 00:03:03,789
It is usually used
to clean the floor,

75
00:03:03,989 --> 00:03:05,269
or clean the tiles 
and what not.

76
00:03:05,469 --> 00:03:09,573
so we have no drinking water

77
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:10,786
for drinks,

78
00:03:10,986 --> 00:03:15,027
We have to stock 
up in stores

79
00:03:15,227 --> 00:03:16,526
with mineral water,

80
00:03:16,726 --> 00:03:19,036
which is a lot
more expensive

81
00:03:19,236 --> 00:03:21,510
and that cost is for the patient,

82
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:22,949
it is not the hospital

83
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:26,032
that will buy the 
packs of mineral water

84
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:29,966
because it hasn't been
counted in the budget

85
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:32,087
to buy it so regularly.

86
00:03:32,287 --> 00:03:35,287
