00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:25,024
Hello, in order to better illustrate
this course

2
00:00:25,224 --> 00:00:28,045
and especially the chapters
describing the methodology,

3
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:30,681
we need to introduce
a practical example.

4
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:34,575
We have decided to focus
on diagnostic imaging

5
00:00:34,775 --> 00:00:37,048
and specifically on radiology. 

6
00:00:37,248 --> 00:00:41,929
In this video we will explain what
is radiology and why it is needed.

7
00:00:42,129 --> 00:00:45,050
However, we will only give you the
very basic information

8
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:49,252
on X-ray radiology that we need to
be able to illustrate the concepts. 

9
00:00:49,984 --> 00:00:53,663
It is not the purpose of this course
to give you a complete presentation

10
00:00:53,863 --> 00:00:54,866
on this topic.

11
00:00:55,066 --> 00:00:58,053
Those of you who are interested to
learn more will find

12
00:00:58,253 --> 00:01:00,269
additional material
on the website.

13
00:01:01,471 --> 00:01:06,277
Let us start by having a brief look
at the invention of this technology

14
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:12,158
Wilhelm Conrad RÃ¶ntgen was
a German physicist born in 1845,

15
00:01:12,358 --> 00:01:15,638
he was the first to discover
a new type of rays,
16
00:01:15,838 --> 00:01:17,529
which he called X-rays.

17
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:22,108
He was awarded a Nobel prize in 1901
for his discovery.

18
00:01:23,025 --> 00:01:26,865
In the picture on the right, you
can see the very first X-ray image

19
00:01:27,065 --> 00:01:32,327
of a human body part. For instance,
showing his wife's hand wearing a nice ring.

20
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:36,346
When she saw her skeleton
she was shocked and she exclaimed

21
00:01:36,546 --> 00:01:37,988
"I have seen my death!"

22
00:01:38,188 --> 00:01:42,934
This picture was taken in 1895
well over a century ago

23
00:01:43,634 --> 00:01:46,705
it marked the birth of medical
radiology.

24
00:01:47,304 --> 00:01:51,484
Let us now see how X-rays
are used in medicine.

25
00:01:52,522 --> 00:01:58,054
X-ray is a high energy ionizing radiation
which can travel through human tissue,

26
00:01:58,254 --> 00:02:02,624
where it can be more or less absorbed
depending on the tissue's density.

27
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:08,095
For example, bone tissue has higher
absorption than soft tissue,

28
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:10,160
such as the lung.

29
00:02:10,897 --> 00:02:14,785
More generally, materials with high
atomic numbers

30
00:02:14,985 --> 00:02:20,654
have high absorption properties. Lead,
for instance, has a very high atomic number 

31
00:02:20,854 --> 00:02:26,945
and is thus used to block X-rays,
which, due to their ionizing properties

32
00:02:27,145 --> 00:02:29,592
can potentially be harmful
for humans.

33
00:02:30,492 --> 00:02:34,837
X-rays are generated in a vacuum tube,
shown on the left ,

34
00:02:35,558 --> 00:02:39,547
in this tube there is a cathode
and an anode.

35
00:02:39,747 --> 00:02:42,845
The cathode,
which is a tungsten filament, 

36
00:02:43,045 --> 00:02:47,806
is heated up with an electric current.
When enough energy is transmitted to

37
00:02:48,006 --> 00:02:51,928
the cathode's atoms some electrons
will be emitted through

38
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:54,123
a thermal ionic effect.

39
00:02:54,785 --> 00:02:59,429
If we now apply a large voltage difference
between the cathode and the anode,

40
00:02:59,629 --> 00:03:05,018
typically 40 to 100 kilo-volts,
the electrons will be accelerated

41
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:09,086
at a high speed away from the
cathode in the direction of the anode.

42
00:03:09,286 --> 00:03:15,080
Once they hit the anode, the electrons
are slowed down by the anode material,

43
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,685
which causes the emission of X-rays.

44
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:23,306
The process requires a lot of power
as only 1% of the energy 

45
00:03:23,506 --> 00:03:28,429
is effectively transformed into
X-rays and the rest is lost as heat.

46
00:03:29,101 --> 00:03:31,348
There are several different
configurations of

47
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:35,360
medical X-ray systems. In one
frequently encountered configuration,

48
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:39,317
the tube is mounted on a stand
with a swiveling arm,

49
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:41,259
such as the one shown here.

50
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:46,522
This configuration allows to ensure
that the tube remains aimed

51
00:03:46,722 --> 00:03:49,427
at the image recording device
at all times.

52
00:03:50,515 --> 00:03:54,943
The system also includes a power
generator and a control panel.

53
00:03:55,756 --> 00:03:59,778
In an other configuration, the tube
is mounted on a pointing device

54
00:03:59,978 --> 00:04:02,548
attached to the ceiling
or to the floor,

55
00:04:02,748 --> 00:04:05,682
with a rail system to enable
moving it around.

56
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:09,960
Some systems include a table where
the patient can be examined

57
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,950
in a lying position, and where the
image recording device is integrated.

58
00:04:15,679 --> 00:04:20,142
Finally, there are also mobile systems
on wheels, which can be moved

59
00:04:20,342 --> 00:04:22,071
to the patient's bedside.

60
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:26,365
Let us now go back and talk about
the image recording device.

61
00:04:26,565 --> 00:04:30,305
Once the X-rays have traveled through
the patient's body they have 

62
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:33,767
to be transformed into an image
that the radiologist can see.

63
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:37,856
This can be achieved basically with
two different processes,

64
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:40,258
which are both still in use today.

65
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:44,631
In the first process, the X-ray image
is converted into visible light

66
00:04:44,831 --> 00:04:49,078
by means of a screen placed close
to a photographic film,

67
00:04:49,278 --> 00:04:53,298
this screen is made of special
crystals and it is also known

68
00:04:53,498 --> 00:04:56,032
as a scintillator screen.

69
00:04:56,232 --> 00:04:59,920
When the X-ray beam containing the
patient's image hits the screen,

70
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,905
visible light is emitted, which
exposes the photographic emulsion of the film.

71
00:05:05,105 --> 00:05:09,127
The film on the screen are located
inside a tightly closed frame

72
00:05:09,327 --> 00:05:10,476
called a cassette.

73
00:05:11,203 --> 00:05:14,673
The second technique generates
a digital image directly,

74
00:05:14,873 --> 00:05:16,244
there is no film involved.

75
00:05:17,033 --> 00:05:20,114
Let's look into these two techniques
in some more details.

76
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:25,532
Here you can see a chest radiography
being taken in a hospital in Cameroon,

77
00:05:25,732 --> 00:05:31,036
as you can see the radiographer on the
right is wearing a protective lead apron.

78
00:05:31,922 --> 00:05:34,412
Here, he's using a mobile radiography system.

79
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:40,610
Note that one has to distinguish between
a radiographer and radiologist,

80
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,361
these are two different jobs.

81
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:47,771
Basically a radiographer is a technician
trained to make radiological images

82
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:52,427
and the radiologist is a medical
doctor trained to interpret the images

83
00:05:52,627 --> 00:05:54,979
with the purpose to come up
with the diagnosis.

84
00:05:55,771 --> 00:05:59,284
The patient stands in front of
what is called a "Wall-bucky",

85
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:01,847
where the cassette with the film
is located.

86
00:06:02,604 --> 00:06:06,734
The radiographer aims the tube
at the patient and exposes the film.

87
00:06:06,934 --> 00:06:12,726
Once this is done, the cassette is
retrieved and taken away for development.

88
00:06:13,283 --> 00:06:17,261
The processing of the film usually
involves steps of developing

89
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:20,087
rinsing, fixing, washing and drying.

90
00:06:20,702 --> 00:06:25,500
This must be done in a dark room and
involves the use of specific and

91
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,088
toxic chemicals. 

92
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:31,188
The timing and temperature of the
process need to be controlled 

93
00:06:31,388 --> 00:06:35,907
precisely, otherwise the image
quality will be degraded.

94
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:40,781
The film can be processed either
manually or automatically,

95
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:45,671
using a film processor, in which case
there is no need for a dark room

96
00:06:45,871 --> 00:06:49,239
but the processor requires
electricity and maintenance.

97
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:54,076
For either manual or automatic
processing the total cost 

98
00:06:54,276 --> 00:06:59,653
of the film and chemicals needed for
one image is around 3.50 US dollars.

99
00:07:00,526 --> 00:07:05,709
In many low and middle income countries
the patient will also have to pay for

100
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:10,705
the diagnosis itself, which
can typically cost 15 US dollars.

101
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:15,059
In a digital imaging process
the film is replaced 

102
00:07:15,259 --> 00:07:19,377
by a photo sensitive detector. The
technology involves a conversion of

103
00:07:19,577 --> 00:07:23,698
the X-ray image into either visible
light or charges that can be 

104
00:07:23,898 --> 00:07:25,928
captured by some electronic sensor.

105
00:07:26,128 --> 00:07:28,961
The current state
of the architecture technology

106
00:07:29,161 --> 00:07:32,441
relies on large detector plates
called flat panels.

107
00:07:32,641 --> 00:07:36,718
The detectors have exactly
the same size as the image

108
00:07:36,918 --> 00:07:40,896
they capture, because it is
very difficult to focus X-ray beams.

109
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:45,100
In the detector, a layer of
scintillator material 

110
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,899
converts the X-ray into visible
light. Directly behind

111
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,081
the scintillator layer is
a sensor array of which each pixel

112
00:07:53,281 --> 00:07:57,193
generates an electrical signal
in proportion to the light received.

113
00:07:57,899 --> 00:08:00,670
This electric signal is encoded
in order to produce

114
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,094
an accurate digital representation
of the X-ray image.

115
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:09,029
Flat panels have the disadvantage
of being very expensive and fragile,

116
00:08:09,229 --> 00:08:13,061
in addition, their performance degrade
quickly when temperatures increases

117
00:08:13,261 --> 00:08:16,082
 above 27 to 30 degrees celsius.

118
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:19,366
There are other types of X-ray
imaging devices based, 

119
00:08:19,566 --> 00:08:24,374
for example, on CCD  or CMOS detectors,
which are similar to the technology

120
00:08:24,574 --> 00:08:26,976
that can be found
in your digital cameras.

121
00:08:27,861 --> 00:08:31,681
They tend to be more cumbersome and
less sensitive to X-ray radiation

122
00:08:31,881 --> 00:08:32,756
than flat panels.

123
00:08:33,509 --> 00:08:36,541
Sensitivity is an important
parameter, because due to 

124
00:08:36,741 --> 00:08:39,015
the potentially harmful effect
of X-rays, 

125
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:42,264
one has to limit the patient
exposure as much as possible.

126
00:08:42,464 --> 00:08:45,030
while still being able
to generate a good image.

127
00:08:46,096 --> 00:08:49,753
Being able to process, store,
review, and transfer digital images 

128
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:54,462
is certainly a great advantage, this
requires a so called PACS,

129
00:08:54,662 --> 00:08:58,400
which stands for: Picture Archiving
and Communication System.

130
00:08:58,879 --> 00:09:02,930
The PACS also allows to manage
the workflow of patient exams.

131
00:09:04,012 --> 00:09:08,081
In modern hospitals, the radiographer
can take an image in some location

132
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:12,621
and the radiologist can review it
on a workstation located elsewhere.

133
00:09:12,821 --> 00:09:17,432
As a a consequence, a PACS generally
requires that some information 

134
00:09:17,632 --> 00:09:20,550
and communication capabilities
are available in the hospital.

135
00:09:21,501 --> 00:09:27,883
In summary, let us say that analog
film screen is still very much in use today,

136
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,400
and overwhelmingly so
in low and middle income countries.

137
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:36,783
However, like in film photography,
it is a technology

138
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:40,048
 that will most certainly disappear
in the future.

139
00:09:40,992 --> 00:09:45,397
It's main disadvantage is the fact
that it relies on consumables,

140
00:09:45,597 --> 00:09:50,459
such as films and chemicals for development,
which can be difficult to obtain.

141
00:09:52,569 --> 00:09:56,921
In addition, while the purchase cost
of the system itself is quite low

142
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:01,170
compared to digital solutions, the
recurring cost of those consumables

143
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,360
 makes this quite an expensive
solution in the long run.

144
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,776
Finally, it is a slow technique which
requires quite a bit of know-how

145
00:10:08,976 --> 00:10:11,123
to be able to make good images.

146
00:10:11,797 --> 00:10:16,025
Digital solutions are more expensive
to purchase and more complex to use

147
00:10:16,225 --> 00:10:21,992
and maintain. Due to the increased
complexity, the need for maintenance, 

148
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:28,665
and calibration, are also increased,
which requires skill and resources.

149
00:10:29,505 --> 00:10:33,534
The great advantage is, of course,
that the image can be easily transferred

150
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:38,748
over the internet, the flip side of
the coin is that this requires

151
00:10:38,948 --> 00:10:42,708
access to information technology,
which may not be available.

152
00:10:44,388 --> 00:10:47,521
The cost of making a digital
image is virtually zero,

153
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:50,635
and the acquisition time
is a couple of seconds,

154
00:10:50,835 --> 00:10:54,381
which allows to increase the number
of patients diagnosed per day.

155
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:59,027
Finally, in both cases, adequate
training is essential for 

156
00:10:59,227 --> 00:11:02,793
three categories of personnel.
The first is for medical doctors

157
00:11:02,993 --> 00:11:06,086
or radiologists to able to interpret
the images, 

158
00:11:06,286 --> 00:11:11,590
the second is for radiographers to
be able to make good quality images

159
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,634
and in a safe way,

160
00:11:13,834 --> 00:11:18,485
the third is for technicians to
be able to service and maintain

161
00:11:18,685 --> 00:11:22,065
the system, as well as the related
infrastructure.

162
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:27,155
Now that we have seen the basics
of medical X-ray imaging,

163
00:11:27,355 --> 00:11:30,338
let us discuss it's importance
in health care.

164
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,775
According to the World Heath
Organization, X-ray radiology

165
00:11:34,975 --> 00:11:40,248
together with diagnostic Ultrasound,
cover 80% to 90% of the needs

166
00:11:40,448 --> 00:11:43,448
for diagnostic imaging in general.

167
00:11:43,648 --> 00:11:48,430
X-ray, in particular, is very much
used for diagnosing trauma.

168
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,156
As we have seen in a prior video,
road traffic accidents 

169
00:11:52,356 --> 00:11:53,595
are very frequent globally,

170
00:11:54,144 --> 00:11:58,903
There are about 20 to 50 million
victims of road accidents every year

171
00:11:59,103 --> 00:12:02,558
and 90% of them live in low and
middle income countries.

172
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:06,325
Another crucially important
application of X-ray imaging

173
00:12:06,525 --> 00:12:09,520
is for the diagnosis of pulmonary
conditions.

174
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,355
Tuberculosis, for example, still
represents a huge problem worldwide.

175
00:12:14,555 --> 00:12:21,638
According to the WHO, in 2015, over
ten million people fell ill with TB

176
00:12:21,838 --> 00:12:24,620
and 1.8 million died
from the disease.  

177
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:30,630
Over 95% of TB deaths occur in low
and middle income countries.

178
00:12:31,306 --> 00:12:35,213
There are many other uses of
diagnostic X-rays such as:

179
00:12:35,413 --> 00:12:38,187
orthopedic conditions,
foreign bodies or cancer.

180
00:12:38,387 --> 00:12:41,095
This is really an essential
modality in medicine, 

181
00:12:41,295 --> 00:12:44,933
but how available is X-ray
on the global scale?

182
00:12:45,943 --> 00:12:49,804
The World Health Organization
estimates that over two thirds

183
00:12:50,004 --> 00:12:54,125
of the global population lack
access to safe, reliable

184
00:12:54,325 --> 00:12:56,540
and competent radiology
services.

185
00:12:57,191 --> 00:13:02,298
This is a shocking number and even
more so when we take into consideration

186
00:13:02,498 --> 00:13:06,847
that this technology was invented
by RÃ¶ntgen over 120 years ago.

187
00:13:07,523 --> 00:13:10,064
This technology is a great example
for our course. 

188
00:13:10,264 --> 00:13:16,087
It really epitomizes all of the five
challenges which we encounter in the context

189
00:13:16,287 --> 00:13:20,881
of low and middle income countries,
and which we have seen in a previous video.

190
00:13:22,055 --> 00:13:26,784
The first challenge, as you remember,
is a lack of quality infrastructure,

191
00:13:26,984 --> 00:13:30,290
X-ray machines can consume a lot
of electrical power,

192
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:34,333
typically between 30 to 50kW

193
00:13:35,141 --> 00:13:39,489
In many hospitals we have seen,
the available power is barely enough

194
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:42,671
to cover just the power needs for the X-ray
system alone, 

195
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:45,944
let alone other needs,
such as lighting. 

196
00:13:47,318 --> 00:13:51,843
The facilities where the X-ray
system is located often also lack

197
00:13:52,043 --> 00:13:54,999
adequate protection against
harmful radiation.

198
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:59,819
Finally, the quality of the water
needed to develop the film

199
00:14:00,019 --> 00:14:05,216
is often below standard, due to poor
quality water supply infrastructure. 

200
00:14:06,339 --> 00:14:11,094
The second challenge of the context
is the lack of financial resources.

201
00:14:11,724 --> 00:14:16,727
The cost of some X-ray machines can
go from US$20K or US$30K for a film

202
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:20,818
screen system, and US$100K
to US$200

203
00:14:21,018 --> 00:14:22,761
for a complete digital solution.

204
00:14:23,492 --> 00:14:28,401
This is far too expensive for most
primarily health care structures.

205
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:34,441
In addition, since regular maintenance
is usually needed, maintenance contracts

206
00:14:34,641 --> 00:14:37,714
over a ten year lifespan can
easily cost as much

207
00:14:37,914 --> 00:14:39,997
as the initial purchase price.

208
00:14:40,197 --> 00:14:44,272
Sadly, one has to mention that most
manufacturers won't assure 

209
00:14:44,472 --> 00:14:46,299
maintenance in remote places anyway.

210
00:14:47,035 --> 00:14:50,754
For these reasons, X-ray systems
which are found in low

211
00:14:50,954 --> 00:14:56,855
and middle income countries are often
donated second-hand obsolete devices.

212
00:14:57,753 --> 00:15:01,711
In Cameroon, which is a lower income
country with a population of 

213
00:15:01,911 --> 00:15:07,465
roughly 20 million, less than 10
radiologists are trained every year.

214
00:15:07,665 --> 00:15:11,179
There is also a permanent lack
of trained radiographers 

215
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,437
and biomedical technicians.

216
00:15:13,903 --> 00:15:16,837
Even when simple maintenance or
repairs are needed,

217
00:15:17,037 --> 00:15:21,655
it is unlikely that anything can
be done locally due to this problem.

218
00:15:22,574 --> 00:15:26,899
The lack of trained personnel is
our third challenge, as we have seen.

219
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:32,615
This is the control panel of an
X-ray system in an African hospital.

220
00:15:33,481 --> 00:15:37,497
As we can see, it was not 
designed to resist the harsh climate

221
00:15:37,697 --> 00:15:39,379
found in these contexts.

222
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,257
Harsh environment
is our fourth challenge.

223
00:15:43,114 --> 00:15:47,798
It takes a heavy toll on X-ray machines,
with little possibilities for repairs,

224
00:15:47,998 --> 00:15:49,161
as we have seen.

225
00:15:49,927 --> 00:15:52,758
Our last challenge
is poor governance.

226
00:15:53,635 --> 00:15:57,844
In the case of X-ray technology,
we have heard of many cases 

227
00:15:58,044 --> 00:16:01,121
of corrupt local representatives
of X-ray manufacturers

228
00:16:01,321 --> 00:16:05,187
or maintenance companies appointed
by the manufacturers.

229
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:09,556
These organizations sometimes
request huge bribes from hospitals,

230
00:16:09,756 --> 00:16:13,990
in spite of existing and already
paid up maintenance contracts.

231
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:18,770
Also when X-ray systems are
purchased, this is mostly done

232
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:22,669
through tenders, due the high
amounts of money involved.

233
00:16:22,869 --> 00:16:27,023
This is an area where corrupt
practices are very frequent.

234
00:16:28,501 --> 00:16:31,727
Now that we know more about
the lack of access to radiology,

235
00:16:31,927 --> 00:16:36,486
how can we approach such a problem
and develop a sustainable solution?

236
00:16:37,441 --> 00:16:40,345
We will try to respond to that in
the remainder of this course.

237
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:42,290
Goodbye.
