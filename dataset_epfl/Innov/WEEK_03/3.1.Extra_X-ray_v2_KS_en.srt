1
00:00:03,753 --> 00:00:05,410
What are the reasons

2
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,637
that explain why there are not

3
00:00:07,837 --> 00:00:10,574
enough x-ray machines available

4
00:00:10,774 --> 00:00:12,739
in the district hospitals?

5
00:00:13,136 --> 00:00:16,159
I can see multiple factors.

6
00:00:17,149 --> 00:00:18,472
The first one being

7
00:00:18,672 --> 00:00:22,166
the supplied equipment

8
00:00:22,366 --> 00:00:24,286
was obsolete, too old,

9
00:00:24,486 --> 00:00:26,924
they are often given

10
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:30,040
so they are old and poorly installed,

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,403
and barely work

12
00:00:31,603 --> 00:00:32,975
or not at all.

13
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:35,520
The environmental elements

14
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,146
that compromises a longer life

15
00:00:40,346 --> 00:00:43,353
of the donated equipment

16
00:00:43,553 --> 00:00:45,072
in our context

17
00:00:45,758 --> 00:00:48,517
is firstly the electric network

18
00:00:49,899 --> 00:00:53,962
and its instability too.

19
00:00:54,162 --> 00:00:56,930
The supply is not constant

20
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,682
there are often power cuts.

21
00:00:58,882 --> 00:01:01,016
And as for the instability

22
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:03,879
the frequent variations

23
00:01:04,079 --> 00:01:05,333
of electric tension.

24
00:01:05,533 --> 00:01:07,810
I think that this is  on one of the main sources of

25
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:09,994
trouble.

26
00:01:10,609 --> 00:01:14,357
Now secondly, the climate issues

27
00:01:14,557 --> 00:01:16,769
that are not always taken into account

28
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:18,582
when the equipment is made:

29
00:01:19,319 --> 00:01:20,573
the heat

30
00:01:20,773 --> 00:01:24,199
that compromises the viability
of certain imaging detectors,

31
00:01:26,464 --> 00:01:28,230
the dust getting in,

32
00:01:29,524 --> 00:01:31,315
and also the humidity,

33
00:01:31,515 --> 00:01:33,181
in certains departments.

34
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:35,707
For the heat

35
00:01:35,907 --> 00:01:38,568
it is not just because the zone is tropical

36
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,987
globally, these are hot countries

37
00:01:41,187 --> 00:01:43,063
but another problem is,

38
00:01:43,263 --> 00:01:47,055
the lack of means

39
00:01:47,255 --> 00:01:50,029
we can't always use an air conditioner,

40
00:01:50,229 --> 00:01:52,568
and even when we manage to get one

41
00:01:52,768 --> 00:01:54,401
you need money for the maintenance,

42
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:56,726
and good quality electric energy

43
00:01:57,588 --> 00:01:59,657
for it to work.

44
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,894
So there are elements

45
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:04,321
that are related to the environment, 

46
00:02:04,521 --> 00:02:06,482
But there are also elements linked to humans

47
00:02:06,682 --> 00:02:09,947
because these are machines

48
00:02:10,147 --> 00:02:12,017
that are essentially fragile,

49
00:02:12,647 --> 00:02:15,720
you need to be well trained

50
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:16,864
to use them,

51
00:02:18,108 --> 00:02:19,361
then,

52
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:21,889
the structures
need to have sufficient means

53
00:02:22,089 --> 00:02:24,684
for the maintenance,
particularly preventive maintenant.

54
00:02:26,069 --> 00:02:27,882
Even if we have the means

55
00:02:28,082 --> 00:02:29,728
for the preventive maintenance

56
00:02:29,928 --> 00:02:34,218
we need properly trained
biomedical engineers

57
00:02:34,418 --> 00:02:35,748
and enough of them

58
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:37,211
available.

59
00:02:37,830 --> 00:02:41,206
So the factors are multiple.

60
00:02:41,406 --> 00:02:42,638
We can dream of

61
00:02:42,838 --> 00:02:44,235
having x-rays here,

62
00:02:44,435 --> 00:02:48,286
the equipment needs to come first.

63
00:02:49,924 --> 00:02:52,547
Meaning the equipment

64
00:02:53,558 --> 00:02:56,090
that is adapted

65
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:58,969
to our conditions

66
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:01,581
and our environment

67
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:06,362
and that we find everywhere.

68
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:09,751
So the GlobalDiagnostiX project

69
00:03:10,952 --> 00:03:12,506
from my point of view,

70
00:03:14,037 --> 00:03:18,762
is a bit of a crazy dream,

71
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:23,131
the dream of some well intentioned people

72
00:03:23,331 --> 00:03:24,945
that found out

73
00:03:25,145 --> 00:03:27,753
that although the need is

74
00:03:27,953 --> 00:03:29,942
in southern countries

75
00:03:30,142 --> 00:03:34,080
the ressources
are mainly in northern countries.

76
00:03:35,746 --> 00:03:37,280
Well intentioned people

77
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,677
who noted that in southern countries

78
00:03:39,877 --> 00:03:41,149
we have a lot of diseases

79
00:03:42,107 --> 00:03:43,130
illnesses,

80
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:46,161
that need x-ray equipment,

81
00:03:46,361 --> 00:03:48,419
at least standard radiologie machines,

82
00:03:48,619 --> 00:03:52,069
the accidents, the lung diseases,

83
00:03:52,269 --> 00:03:54,335
certain types on emergencies,

84
00:03:54,535 --> 00:03:56,887
that need the presence, the availability,

85
00:03:57,087 --> 00:03:58,036
of x-rays

86
00:03:58,236 --> 00:04:00,614
and yet this is not available

87
00:04:00,814 --> 00:04:02,587
in most hospitals

88
00:04:02,787 --> 00:04:04,153
on the outskirts, 

89
00:04:04,353 --> 00:04:06,020
especially in the district hospitals.

90
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,605
It's therefore the crazy dream

91
00:04:07,805 --> 00:04:10,194
of people who hope to fix that,

92
00:04:10,394 --> 00:04:12,309
to bring solutions.

93
00:04:13,476 --> 00:04:15,017
The GlobalDiagnostiX project,

94
00:04:16,087 --> 00:04:20,245
in a common initiative

95
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:22,495


96
00:04:21,224 --> 00:04:23,370
of people in Switzerland and Cameroon

97
00:04:24,007 --> 00:04:26,128
who are trying to make available

98
00:04:26,328 --> 00:04:28,019
as quickly as possible,

99
00:04:28,219 --> 00:04:31,566
standard radiology machine

100
00:04:30,718 --> 00:04:33,718


101
00:04:32,368 --> 00:04:33,820
but that it is digital

102
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,047
and able to resist

103
00:04:36,812 --> 00:04:38,376
to all the strains

104
00:04:38,576 --> 00:04:41,583
that the currently available machines go under

105
00:04:41,783 --> 00:04:44,308
and with a global cost

106
00:04:44,508 --> 00:04:46,059
including the maintenance

107
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:49,426
the amortization cost,

108
00:04:49,626 --> 00:04:51,339
which is reasonable,

109
00:04:51,539 --> 00:04:53,603
maybe even less than what is already available.

110
00:04:53,803 --> 00:04:55,471
The GlobalDiagnostiX project

111
00:04:56,109 --> 00:04:59,251
will offer a standard x ray machine

112
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:03,054
able to withstand the electric current,

113
00:05:03,511 --> 00:05:06,360
working on battery power
for certain lengths of time

114
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,542
so staying on

115
00:05:08,742 --> 00:05:09,802
even if there is a power cut,

116
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:13,241
a machine that is mechanically

117
00:05:13,441 --> 00:05:14,497
solid,

118
00:05:15,175 --> 00:05:17,068
designed to be airtight

119
00:05:17,268 --> 00:05:19,068
to dust infiltration

120
00:05:19,268 --> 00:05:22,005
with a detector designed

121
00:05:22,205 --> 00:05:24,399
to resist against high temperatures,

122
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:28,097
with controls based

123
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:30,788
essentially relying on mechanical movements

124
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:32,078
and not electronic ones,

125
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:34,567
like the previous machines,

126
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:36,001
these electric controls

127
00:05:36,201 --> 00:05:38,554
being a primary source of break downs. 

128
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:45,285
An intuitive radiography equipment

129
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:48,349
because we are planning a work station

130
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,556
that guides the operator

131
00:05:51,135 --> 00:05:53,903
given that there won't be one
in every district hospital

132
00:05:54,103 --> 00:05:55,852
people trained to do

133
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:57,396
standard radiology

134
00:05:57,596 --> 00:05:59,508
the machine could indicate

135
00:05:59,708 --> 00:06:01,338
what steps to take

136
00:06:01,538 --> 00:06:03,652
for someone
who hasn't been properly trained.

137
00:06:04,495 --> 00:06:07,050
The machine will also contain

138
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:08,725
module to help

139
00:06:08,925 --> 00:06:11,113
interpret the typical images,

140
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:13,874
to recognise

141
00:06:14,074 --> 00:06:15,644
the good quality pictures.

142
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:18,113
And as for the marketing,

143
00:06:18,313 --> 00:06:20,134
the GlobalDiagnostiX

144
00:06:21,573 --> 00:06:23,078
associated

145
00:06:23,278 --> 00:06:24,831
with a company

146
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:28,617
that will commercialise the machine that has already been created,

147
00:06:29,772 --> 00:06:31,441
which will be offering

148
00:06:31,641 --> 00:06:34,243
equipment that has already been sold

149
00:06:34,443 --> 00:06:35,921
not one year

150
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:38,344
but a few years warranty

151
00:06:38,988 --> 00:06:41,086
ideally around a 6 year. 

152
00:06:41,817 --> 00:06:43,381
Also

153
00:06:43,581 --> 00:06:45,210
preventive maintenance is

154
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:46,828
included in the sale price

155
00:06:47,862 --> 00:06:49,831
that comes also with

156
00:06:50,031 --> 00:06:52,069
a training course

157
00:06:52,269 --> 00:06:54,131
for the technician

158
00:06:54,331 --> 00:06:58,047
but also for the local consultant

159
00:06:58,247 --> 00:07:00,739
to use the equipment properly.

160
00:07:02,175 --> 00:07:04,406
So not to drag on,

161
00:07:05,113 --> 00:07:07,821
this project is based on concrete observations

162
00:07:08,021 --> 00:07:09,824
of the difficulties we face

163
00:07:10,024 --> 00:07:12,881
and is offering to answer point by point

164
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:14,503
the principal difficulties.

165
00:07:14,703 --> 00:07:16,183
And what we forgot to say,

166
00:07:16,383 --> 00:07:19,223
is that in its conception,

167
00:07:20,912 --> 00:07:23,932
the local teams in Cameroon,

168
00:07:24,132 --> 00:07:25,592
chosen as the pilot country,

169
00:07:25,792 --> 00:07:27,660
are implicated at each stage

170
00:07:28,604 --> 00:07:30,946
whether it be the in design of the machine

171
00:07:31,146 --> 00:07:34,374
or for the interface for obtaining the images

172
00:07:34,574 --> 00:07:35,974
whether it be the questions

173
00:07:36,174 --> 00:07:37,685
linked to the norms of radiology

174
00:07:37,885 --> 00:07:39,496
benefitting from the expertise

175
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:41,564
of the national radioprotection agency

176
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:44,554
or for the contextual elements

177
00:07:44,754 --> 00:07:46,799
or anthropological aspects

178
00:07:46,999 --> 00:07:50,578
its acceptability by the personnel in a tropical area, etc.

179
00:07:50,778 --> 00:07:52,149
So at each stage

180
00:07:52,349 --> 00:07:53,743
we are consulted

181
00:07:53,943 --> 00:07:55,429
and every time when it is necessary

182
00:07:55,629 --> 00:07:57,744
the parts of the machine come to Cameroon

183
00:07:57,944 --> 00:07:58,871
to be tested

184
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:02,004
in their future place of use.

185
00:08:03,303 --> 00:08:05,616
Globally the GlobalDiagnostiX project,

186
00:08:05,816 --> 00:08:09,371
is trying to propose to southern countries

187
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:11,341
a swiss army knife for radiology

188
00:08:12,096 --> 00:08:14,108
or, according to us,

189
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:16,781
an untameable lion (Camerooninan soccer team) of imagery

190
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:19,539
so that is the GlobalDiagnostiX project,

191
00:08:19,739 --> 00:08:20,816
according to us.
