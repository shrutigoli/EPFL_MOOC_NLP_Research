00:00:19,079 --> 00:00:22,041
This lecture is a continuation
of the previous lecture that

2
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:26,183
introduced the Impact
Framework Canvas before.

3
00:00:26,353 --> 00:00:28,253
Here we will continue
with our example

4
00:00:28,422 --> 00:00:33,110
of the digital X-ray imaging system
that we introduced recently.

5
00:00:33,675 --> 00:00:36,863
To facilitate continuity
we stick with our logos

6
00:00:37,029 --> 00:00:42,179
from the previous examples
to represent the various stages.

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,740
Again, as we did in our
simplified example,

8
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:50,610
before we begin, we start
by defining the problem at hand.

9
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:55,365
In this case the problem we have
is that today there are about

10
00:00:55,534 --> 00:00:59,571
15 million road traffic accident
victims per year

11
00:01:00,072 --> 00:01:05,147
of which 90% live in low
and middle income countries.

12
00:01:05,975 --> 00:01:12,775
While pulmonary diseases account
for 14% of all deaths world wide.

13
00:01:11,073 --> 00:01:14,073


14
00:01:13,264 --> 00:01:14,976
X-ray imaging radiology

15
00:01:15,149 --> 00:01:18,774
is the gold standard for
the diagnosis and care of patients

16
00:01:18,941 --> 00:01:21,441
with pulmonary diseases
and for trauma victims

17
00:01:21,614 --> 00:01:23,814
from road accidents.

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,775
However two thirds of humanity
still have no access to radiology

19
00:01:27,951 --> 00:01:32,838
and this lack is mainly in low
and middle income countries.

20
00:01:33,575 --> 00:01:36,763
In response to this critical
social health problem

21
00:01:37,438 --> 00:01:42,726
we have coined a long term
objective or desired social impact,

22
00:01:43,095 --> 00:01:47,132
which is to reduce illness
and deaths from trauma related

23
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:51,793
and pulmonary morbidities
in low and middle income countries.

24
00:01:52,003 --> 00:01:53,503
And how will we do this?

25
00:01:53,684 --> 00:01:57,522
By increasing access
to radiology for the diagnosis

26
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,050
of these indications
through the availability

27
00:02:00,216 --> 00:02:04,841
and use of a cost-effective
robust digital X-ray imaging system,

28
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:08,048
that is the GDX machine
described before.

29
00:02:08,219 --> 00:02:12,532
But also, along with training
and maintenance or repair services

30
00:02:12,712 --> 00:02:16,699
that are critical for the continued
function of the machine.

31
00:02:17,299 --> 00:02:20,687

32
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:26,355


33
00:02:26,743 --> 00:02:30,118


34
00:02:30,287 --> 00:02:34,524


35
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:37,943
We then need to work backwards
in order to identify and define

36
00:02:38,119 --> 00:02:41,869
all the necessary and sufficient
conditions or sequence of outcomes

37
00:02:42,033 --> 00:02:45,795
that are required and must be
in place for the impact to occur.

38
00:02:45,965 --> 00:02:49,102
As we saw before the whole
impact framework consists

39
00:02:49,266 --> 00:02:50,653
of five stages.

40
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:54,515
The first stage is inputs,
which refers to the resources

41
00:02:54,678 --> 00:02:59,865
that need to be deployed in order to
enable the implementation of tasks.

42
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:05,226
In our case, we identified
the following vital inputs.

43
00:03:05,449 --> 00:03:07,561
One, context information.

44
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:09,763
As discussed in an earlier lecture

45
00:03:09,941 --> 00:03:12,116
this essentially refers
to the information 

46
00:03:12,297 --> 00:03:15,984
about the context of the low
and middle income regions

47
00:03:16,366 --> 00:03:22,103
which is related to economics,
infrastructure, personnel

48
00:03:22,272 --> 00:03:24,772
and environmental
and physical factors

49
00:03:24,955 --> 00:03:27,730
as well as governance issues.

50
00:03:28,058 --> 00:03:32,583
Expertise, notably
Engineering and Medical expertise

51
00:03:32,736 --> 00:03:37,749
in order to carry out the required
R&D to produce the prototype.

52
00:03:38,137 --> 00:03:42,837
Capital, in order to fund
the required operations.

53
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:45,419
The next thing
to specify is Activities,

54
00:03:45,577 --> 00:03:48,577
which we can define
as the actions and/or tasks

55
00:03:48,762 --> 00:03:53,024
that must be performed in support
of specific impact objectives.

56
00:03:53,454 --> 00:03:58,329
In this case the key activities
that we identified were

57
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:00,616
to develop an affordable and robust

58
00:04:00,797 --> 00:04:04,459
medical X-ray imaging system,
the GDX system

59
00:04:04,626 --> 00:04:06,414
and also to develop
a training module

60
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:09,578
to enhance proper use
and machine longevity

61
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:14,379
as well as develop a maintenance
& repair plan and infrastructure

62
00:04:14,565 --> 00:04:18,690
to ensure annual maintenance
and prompt repair when needed,

63
00:04:18,934 --> 00:04:22,409
while also developing
a marketing plan to promote

64
00:04:22,587 --> 00:04:25,262
the GDX machine
to buyer stakeholders

65
00:04:25,429 --> 00:04:27,891
and enhance it's uptake.

66
00:04:28,164 --> 00:04:32,177
After that we must describe
the outputs which are essentially

67
00:04:32,336 --> 00:04:35,748
the tangible products and services
that result from the activities

68
00:04:35,923 --> 00:04:36,748
undertaken.

69
00:04:36,913 --> 00:04:41,338
In our case this would be
a fully certified GDX X-ray system

70
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,838
that is available in low
and middle income regions

71
00:04:45,024 --> 00:04:47,336
as well as tutorials
and other support modules

72
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:50,260
that would be on the machine
or online along with

73
00:04:50,438 --> 00:04:52,463
the certificate bearing
training program

74
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,626
that is accredited by
the relevant national authorities

75
00:04:55,798 --> 00:04:57,173
whenever possible.

76
00:04:57,528 --> 00:05:00,190
Also a deployment plan,
which includes marketing

77
00:05:00,364 --> 00:05:03,114
and other plans in order
to create awareness

78
00:05:03,301 --> 00:05:06,101
and promote sales
and uptake of the machine.

79
00:05:07,024 --> 00:05:10,087
Then we come to the outcomes,
which essentially refers

80
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,400
to the changes or effects
on individuals that follow

81
00:05:14,559 --> 00:05:17,859
from the delivery
of products and services.

82
00:05:18,487 --> 00:05:20,849
Here our expected outcomes include

83
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:23,785
an increase in
the number of hospitals,

84
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,847
especially rural hospitals,
who have the GDX system

85
00:05:29,124 --> 00:05:30,411
that the personnel operating

86
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:33,563
the GDX system have
appropriate skills

87
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,220
to operate it.

88
00:05:35,412 --> 00:05:37,974
An increase in the number
of diagnosed patients 

89
00:05:38,146 --> 00:05:41,708
showing up with morbidities
linked to orthopedic trauma

90
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,568
in the hospitals that have
the GDX imaging system.

91
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:50,569
Increased access overall
to radiology and diagnosis

92
00:05:50,745 --> 00:05:53,370
of trauma related
and pulmonary morbidities

93
00:05:53,544 --> 00:05:56,882
in low and middle
income countries.

94
00:05:57,467 --> 00:06:02,029
In this case we also define
an intermediate outcome

95
00:06:02,196 --> 00:06:05,084
which is basically
the aggregate result

96
00:06:05,234 --> 00:06:08,234
from the outcomes
just before your impact.

97
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,583
In this case you have defined
it as the sustainable

98
00:06:11,742 --> 00:06:13,867
and effective use and maintenance

99
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:17,486
of diagnostic machines
by population

100
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:22,677
which is expected to be achieved
if outcomes listed before do occur.

101
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:24,916
So we have now established our set

102
00:06:25,093 --> 00:06:27,368
of sequential
inter-dependent outcomes

103
00:06:27,542 --> 00:06:31,142
that collectively comprise
our theory of change.

104
00:06:31,402 --> 00:06:35,902
Now the next step is to identify
what our basic assumptions are.

105
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,140
Bearing in mind that documenting
and justifying assumptions

106
00:06:39,319 --> 00:06:43,269
is a continuous
and often iterative process.

107
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:47,055
As we progress through our
framework and produce our outcomes

108
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:50,506
it remains necessary
to check and explain

109
00:06:50,878 --> 00:06:52,978
if and why they are necessary.

110
00:06:54,138 --> 00:06:56,975
And here we do not list all
the possible assumptions

111
00:06:57,144 --> 00:06:59,681
 but only the key ones.

112
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:05,235
Our first assumption is that
if the GDX machine is available 

113
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:08,419
in the market, then our
potential buyers

114
00:07:08,582 --> 00:07:12,545
such as governments or NGOs
will actually buy it.

115
00:07:14,005 --> 00:07:17,417
And another related assumption
to this is that the potential buyers

116
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,356
will actually have availability

117
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:22,796
and/or access to funds
to acquire machines.

118
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:28,597
We have also made an assumption
that the contextual situation

119
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:30,722
will remain largely as it is

120
00:07:30,892 --> 00:07:33,680
and that there will be
no radical contextual changes,

121
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:39,249
such as political, social,
environmental, or economic changes

122
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:42,667
in the countries and regions
we're interested in.

123
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:49,002
If any of these assumptions
turn out not to be correct

124
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:53,328
our progress to impact
might be severely hampered

125
00:07:53,726 --> 00:07:57,026
so it is very important
to continuously verify

126
00:07:57,195 --> 00:07:58,670
your assumptions and be prepared

127
00:07:58,829 --> 00:08:02,716
to adjust them
accordingly, if necessary.

128
00:08:03,197 --> 00:08:05,710
The next step is what we called

129
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:08,627
step four in
the introduction lecture,

130
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:12,154
and it is about identifying
the interventions that

131
00:08:12,318 --> 00:08:17,855
our initiative will perform
to create our desired changes

132
00:08:17,368 --> 00:08:20,368


133
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:20,400
that is, outcomes and impact.

134
00:08:21,189 --> 00:08:25,814
Earlier on we listed our
intermediate outcomes to

135
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,000
include sustainable
and effective use

136
00:08:29,232 --> 00:08:34,719
as well as maintenance of
the GDX machines by the hospitals.

137
00:08:35,612 --> 00:08:38,875
So what will be
the key impact driver here?

138
00:08:39,998 --> 00:08:42,310
Of course the availability
of qualified personnel

139
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:45,846
to operate the machines
is very essential to ensure

140
00:08:46,027 --> 00:08:48,277
 sustainable and effective use.

141
00:08:48,786 --> 00:08:51,586
Certainly we can intervene
here by making sure that

142
00:08:51,744 --> 00:08:55,144
there is continued training
of the personnel involved

143
00:08:55,329 --> 00:08:58,929
with the X-ray machines,
such as technicians and doctors.

144
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,517
This can also be a mechanism
to address the problem

145
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:08,115
of high personnel turnover that
can be prevalent in these regions.

146
00:09:08,288 --> 00:09:10,601
As we said in
the previous lecture

147
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:12,589
you need to establish
how you will measure

148
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,500
and monitor the implementation

149
00:09:14,665 --> 00:09:17,877
and effectiveness
of your initiative.

150
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:20,992
By collecting data on
the results as you go along

151
00:09:21,171 --> 00:09:23,846
you can identify what is
or is not working

152
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:25,548
and find out why.

153
00:09:25,844 --> 00:09:28,844
This is accomplished
by using indicators,

154
00:09:29,057 --> 00:09:32,644
 which you will monitor
or measure at the various points

155
00:09:32,824 --> 00:09:34,387
when they occur.

156
00:09:34,796 --> 00:09:36,846
In the case of our GDX machine

157
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:40,547
one of the initial and most
important indicators will be

158
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:44,413
the number of GDX machines
produced every year.

159
00:09:44,966 --> 00:09:48,391
Because, unless a sufficient
number is produced every year

160
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:54,775
the rest of the planned
activities cannot occur effectively.

161
00:09:55,498 --> 00:09:57,561
And subsequently
even if the condition

162
00:09:57,725 --> 00:10:03,187
of adequate supply is true,
if there are not enough hospitals

163
00:10:03,352 --> 00:10:04,889
actually acquiring the machine

164
00:10:05,055 --> 00:10:08,930
then we have a problem towards
our impact and objective.

165
00:10:09,104 --> 00:10:11,316
Thus the number of hospitals

166
00:10:11,484 --> 00:10:15,922
acquiring the GDX machines
produced every year

167
00:10:16,213 --> 00:10:19,338
as well as the number of X-ray staff
completing training per year

168
00:10:19,496 --> 00:10:23,771
are both very important indicators
to monitor and measure.

169
00:10:24,088 --> 00:10:26,313
Of course,
if all these ideas are true

170
00:10:26,485 --> 00:10:30,747
then the next key question
is the number and increase

171
00:10:30,913 --> 00:10:34,488
in the number of patients
that are actually being diagnosed

172
00:10:34,661 --> 00:10:38,236
with the GDX machines per year.

173
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:40,943
So, finally our GDX impact framework

174
00:10:41,116 --> 00:10:45,879
looks like this after
we add the indicators as well.

175
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,808
Before we conclude the section
on impact definition

176
00:10:48,973 --> 00:10:52,385
I also want to briefly introduce
another emerging

177
00:10:52,559 --> 00:10:55,046
but potentially important
related concept 

178
00:10:55,212 --> 00:10:58,574
namely the Social Return
on Investment.

179
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:01,572
In all likelihood most of you
will need to raise funds 

180
00:11:01,743 --> 00:11:05,268
to help execute your projects
and fund raising can be done

181
00:11:05,452 --> 00:11:07,640
from foundations as grants

182
00:11:07,808 --> 00:11:12,108
or from investors or other
financial sources as equity or debt.

183
00:11:12,758 --> 00:11:15,420
In order to help your project
to become more attractive

184
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:18,116
to the potential funder
or investor,

185
00:11:18,334 --> 00:11:22,596
it may be helpful if you also
attach some kind of monetary value

186
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:25,770
to the impact you aim for.

187
00:11:26,388 --> 00:11:29,688
To help you do this, a widely
used method
188
00:11:29,850 --> 00:11:34,238
is to calculate what is termed 
the Social Return on Investment

189
00:11:34,406 --> 00:11:36,568
or SROI.

190
00:11:37,207 --> 00:11:40,495
Which, if you like, could be
conceptually equivalent

191
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:45,460
to a Return on Investment
in a traditional business plan.

192
00:11:46,137 --> 00:11:49,112
Social Return on Investment is
an essentially a method

193
00:11:49,289 --> 00:11:55,027
for measuring non-financial value
relative to the resources invested,

194
00:11:55,201 --> 00:11:59,101
that is, value such as environmental
and social factors

195
00:11:59,297 --> 00:12:04,710
that would not be reflected in
conventional financial accounts.

196
00:12:05,464 --> 00:12:12,239
The SROI is usually presented
as a ratio, the SROI ratio,

197
00:12:12,392 --> 00:12:18,467
which is simply the numerical total
value of benefits over the value

198
00:12:15,848 --> 00:12:18,848


199
00:12:18,642 --> 00:12:21,642
of inputs or investments.

200
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,488
Impact investors and funders
may use this metric to prioritize

201
00:12:26,658 --> 00:12:29,483
projects or ventures to fund.

202
00:12:29,815 --> 00:12:33,465
For you, you can also use it
to prioritize which innovations

203
00:12:33,643 --> 00:12:36,618
or applications
to develop or focus on

204
00:12:36,786 --> 00:12:40,673
if you are confronted with
various options, for example.

205
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:43,849
We will not have the time
to discuss an example

206
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:46,050
in this lecture, unfortunately,
but we have provided

207
00:12:46,212 --> 00:12:50,187
a comprehensive list of references
that we highly recommend

208
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,360
you consult for further details.

209
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,645
So to summarize, SROI
is generally used as a tool

210
00:12:57,815 --> 00:13:00,840
to provide 
a numerical estimate

211
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:03,939
of the social value
of the project.

212
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:07,474
Similarly to the computation
of the expected return

213
00:13:07,647 --> 00:13:10,297
from a project in finance.

214
00:13:11,082 --> 00:13:14,294
Expected return is used to gauge
the potential value

215
00:13:14,462 --> 00:13:18,500
of the given project prior to it's
selection or implementation

216
00:13:18,671 --> 00:13:21,859
and it can help select
or prioritize projects.

217
00:13:22,170 --> 00:13:24,845
Similarly, social return
on investment metric

218
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:27,505
is used at the beginning
of the whole process

219
00:13:27,687 --> 00:13:31,900
but not generally
to measure outcomes at the end.

220
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:35,990
So, to conclude, we hope
that the two lectures

221
00:13:36,169 --> 00:13:41,469
have given you a fundamental insight
on how to use the impact canvas tool

222
00:13:41,636 --> 00:13:45,923
to develop your impact
framework for your project.

223
00:13:46,711 --> 00:13:50,424
We will revisit the use of this tool
and see how it can be integrated

224
00:13:50,571 --> 00:13:54,833
with another powerful canvas tool,
the business model canvas.

225
00:13:55,012 --> 00:13:57,599
in order to give rise to,
what we term

226
00:13:57,783 --> 00:14:01,695
the sustainable business
model business canvas tool.

227
00:14:01,852 --> 00:14:04,015
Goodbye.
