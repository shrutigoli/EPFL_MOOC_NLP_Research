1
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:20,561
Hello. These images were taken
from a project to develop

2
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:24,252
a diagnostic radiology system for
low income contexts. 

3
00:00:24,452 --> 00:00:28,745
Let us assume that you have a 
project idea which involves

4
00:00:28,945 --> 00:00:32,658
technology innovation to tackle 
a development issue.

5
00:00:32,858 --> 00:00:37,560
Your goal is to generate a positive
impact for people living in poverty.

6
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:41,966
How should you proceed to maximize
your chances of success?

7
00:00:42,166 --> 00:00:44,478
What are the steps you need to
consider?

8
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,920
And the tools at your disposal?
What are the hurdles? 

9
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,514
What are the good practices that
you can take advantage of?

10
00:00:51,714 --> 00:00:56,449
In this video we will give you an
overview of the process.

11
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,702
It will lead us from a very early
stage, when all you have is a rough

12
00:01:00,902 --> 00:01:05,098
idea, all the way up to deployment
and scaling up of your technology.

13
00:01:05,298 --> 00:01:09,568
Before we look at the process itself
we would like to briefly discuss

14
00:01:09,768 --> 00:01:12,707
the question of profit versus 
impact.

15
00:01:12,907 --> 00:01:16,664
First, we should remember that the 
impact we want to make

16
00:01:16,864 --> 00:01:20,055
must not only be positively affecting
a large number of people,

17
00:01:20,255 --> 00:01:24,821
but it must also be sustainable.
The problem is that at the end of

18
00:01:25,021 --> 00:01:28,396
the day someone will have to pay
for the technology.

19
00:01:28,596 --> 00:01:32,011
Funds will be needed for 
manufacturing, maintaining

20
00:01:32,211 --> 00:01:36,074
and servicing the technology, as well as for
commissioning and training

21
00:01:36,274 --> 00:01:40,670
of the users. This is why two things
are necessary.

22
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:47,477
One - a sustainable source of funds,
and two - a vehicle responsible for

23
00:01:47,677 --> 00:01:50,265
implementing the technology 
innovation.

24
00:01:50,465 --> 00:01:55,751
This vehicle could be a company or
some other form which may or may not

25
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:59,547
involve profit generation. But it 
must be sustainable. 

26
00:01:59,747 --> 00:02:03,382
Entrepreneurship can be a great 
way to generate a positive and

27
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:06,027
sustainable improvement for the 
poor.

28
00:02:06,227 --> 00:02:10,754
In the traditional view, we have two
worlds, which are completely separate

29
00:02:10,954 --> 00:02:11,795
from each other. 

30
00:02:11,995 --> 00:02:15,940
On the right there are the 
traditional for-profit companies,

31
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,677
which only strive to maximize 
shareholder value.

32
00:02:19,877 --> 00:02:23,173
And on the left we have not-for 
-profit organizations, such as

33
00:02:23,373 --> 00:02:28,162
foundations and NGOs, which 
depend on subsidies and are only

34
00:02:28,362 --> 00:02:33,699
interested in impact. In this view,
the former are sustainable,

35
00:02:33,899 --> 00:02:37,778
but do not necessarily bring a 
positive impact. While the latter

36
00:02:37,978 --> 00:02:41,386
are more likely to bring a positive 
impact, but are not necessarily

37
00:02:41,586 --> 00:02:47,016
 sustainable. This is a very outdated
view. Indeed, one should rather see

38
00:02:47,216 --> 00:02:50,989
things as a button slider. Since
there are many possibilities

39
00:02:51,189 --> 00:02:54,189
in between those two extremes. 

40
00:02:54,389 --> 00:02:58,715
These intermediate models, which are
sometimes called social businesses,

41
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:02,926
strive to leverage market forces in
order to generate a sustainable

42
00:03:03,126 --> 00:03:08,825
impact. We believe that this offers
great opportunities, but also

43
00:03:09,025 --> 00:03:14,560
some difficulties. As an entrepreneur
using this kind of model, you may be

44
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,053
confronted with a difficult choice.

45
00:03:17,253 --> 00:03:19,848
Do you prefer to maximize impact?

46
00:03:20,048 --> 00:03:23,180
Or profit? You will have to decide.

47
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:28,039
Fundamentally, there's nothing
inherently bad about making profit

48
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:31,080
if we provide solutions to unmet 
needs.

49
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,907
On the contrary, if you're able to
combine profit and impact,

50
00:03:35,107 --> 00:03:39,510
this is a situation where you can 
generate your own fuel for growth

51
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,163
and extend the reach of your impact.

52
00:03:42,363 --> 00:03:47,288
Making profit is required anyway, if
you need initial or later stage

53
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:52,006
funding from investors. For this 
course, we will consider that

54
00:03:52,206 --> 00:03:56,643
the slider in this figure will not 
be at either of the two extremes.

55
00:03:56,843 --> 00:04:01,320
It's somewhere in between.
In conclusion, let us take into consideration

56
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:06,315
that achieving a sustainable and large 
scale impact will involve developing

57
00:04:06,515 --> 00:04:09,236
a profitable business model. 

58
00:04:09,436 --> 00:04:12,353
Let's move on and discuss the
process.

59
00:04:12,553 --> 00:04:16,293
We will look at all the steps in
detail in later videos, but for now

60
00:04:16,493 --> 00:04:21,015
let us keep a helicopter view and
discuss general principles.

61
00:04:21,215 --> 00:04:24,705
Here you can see the three main
phases of the process,

62
00:04:24,905 --> 00:04:28,229
with the impact we're 
trying to achieve at the end.

63
00:04:28,429 --> 00:04:32,463
The process starts with a choice of
a development challenge, which we

64
00:04:32,663 --> 00:04:35,596
want to solve using a technology 
innovation.

65
00:04:35,796 --> 00:04:40,557
We then develop a concept which we
validate through some feasibility

66
00:04:40,757 --> 00:04:43,517
prototyping and various tests.

67
00:04:43,717 --> 00:04:48,535
Finally, we move to implementation,
which includes deploying our solution

68
00:04:48,735 --> 00:04:51,850
scaling it up, so that it 
sustainably reaches as many

69
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:54,079
beneficiaries as possible.

70
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,941
Looks simple, doesn't it?

71
00:04:56,141 --> 00:04:59,015
As always things are a bit more
complicated than that.

72
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,166
And we will get there.

73
00:05:01,354 --> 00:05:05,804
But prior to that, let me make 
a few general remarks.

74
00:05:06,004 --> 00:05:12,379
We need to remember that innovation
necessarily involves change.

75
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:16,228
For example, changing behaviors 
or habits.

76
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:22,010
Bringing about change is hard and it
follows that innovation inherently

77
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,761
includes risk. Obviously, the risk 
of failing is highest

78
00:05:26,961 --> 00:05:30,522
at the beginning, when the only
thing we know is what kind of

79
00:05:30,722 --> 00:05:33,690
development issue we want to
tackle. 

80
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:37,604
At that stage we know very little
about how to generate this much

81
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:43,377
desired impact. As we move forward
in the project, we learn about the

82
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:47,386
context, the needs of the people
we are trying to help. The social,

83
00:05:47,586 --> 00:05:50,823
political and cultural background.
And so on. 

84
00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:54,877
The more we know, the more
control we have on the risk of failure.

85
00:05:55,077 --> 00:05:59,554
As a consequence, this is essentially
a learning process.

86
00:05:59,754 --> 00:06:04,130
The best way to learn is to 
cooperate  with people who know

87
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:06,579
the needs and the context. 

88
00:06:06,779 --> 00:06:11,380
Third, due to the high level of
unknowns at the start, one thing we

89
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,463
can be sure of is that the process
won't be linear or smooth.

90
00:06:15,663 --> 00:06:20,060
The unfolding of the project will
most certainly involve many

91
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,546
iterations, trials and errors, and
sometimes a complete change of

92
00:06:23,746 --> 00:06:28,364
strategy. This is why we need to be
agile and adjust quickly.

93
00:06:28,564 --> 00:06:32,647
Let us now look at each phase
starting with the concept.

94
00:06:32,847 --> 00:06:37,095
We have to start by identifying
the target beneficiaries. 

95
00:06:37,295 --> 00:06:41,016
Once we have done that, we need
to select a pilot country or region

96
00:06:41,216 --> 00:06:42,674
or community. 

97
00:06:42,874 --> 00:06:46,591
It is important that our project
has both an ambitious and,

98
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:51,146
if possible, a global impact goal.
But also, that it is strongly

99
00:06:51,346 --> 00:06:54,388
ingrained in local knowledge.

100
00:06:54,588 --> 00:06:58,759
This is the only way we can learn
all we need to know for our project.

101
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:04,174
We need to identify local stake 
holders and experts in the specific

102
00:07:04,374 --> 00:07:08,491
field that we want to address. And
to involve them in the project.

103
00:07:08,691 --> 00:07:13,520
For example, for diagnostic imaging
we selected Cameroon as the pilot

104
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,843
country. And we identified as a key
stakeholder, the head of the

105
00:07:18,043 --> 00:07:21,617
diagnostic imaging division at the main
university hospital there.

106
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:26,298
In this phase we also need to
honestly and painstakingly take

107
00:07:26,498 --> 00:07:30,096
stock of existing solutions or
alternatives. 

108
00:07:30,296 --> 00:07:33,720
We need to understand what works
and what does not work. And why

109
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,625
it does not work. 

110
00:07:35,825 --> 00:07:40,800
Finally, we need to define detailed
requirement specifications

111
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,205
for our technology innovation. 

112
00:07:43,405 --> 00:07:47,923
These specs need to be quantitative.
For example, the diagnostic imaging

113
00:07:48,123 --> 00:07:51,980
system must allow to diagnose 40
patients per day and still work at

114
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,456
temperatures of 45 degrees C.

115
00:07:56,656 --> 00:08:01,064
As we will see, all of this 
information will allow us

116
00:08:01,264 --> 00:08:05,795
to establish the long-term goal we
want to reach and also the pathway

117
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:07,407
to get there. 

118
00:08:07,607 --> 00:08:10,802
This is commonly referred to as
the theory of change.

119
00:08:11,002 --> 00:08:14,667
And it is discussed in more detail
later in this course. 

120
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:19,399
In the second phase we will
essentially want to develop solutions

121
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,410
and test them as much as possible
together without partners.

122
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:28,397
This really involves 1) developing 
the technology and 2) developing a

123
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:30,661
sustainable business model.

124
00:08:30,861 --> 00:08:34,659
In both cases we will have to go
through multiple trial and error

125
00:08:34,859 --> 00:08:39,700
loops. It is crucial to test our
hypotheses in our pilot country.

126
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:43,597
And with the key stakeholders we
have identified.

127
00:08:43,797 --> 00:08:48,222
It is great practice to build simple
and cheap models which can be put

128
00:08:48,422 --> 00:08:53,062
to test and deliver quick answers.
We need to be agile and to quickly

129
00:08:53,262 --> 00:08:55,599
adjust the strategy when needed.

130
00:08:55,799 --> 00:08:59,517
Sometimes, as for medical devices
or pharmaceutical drugs, 

131
00:08:59,717 --> 00:09:03,585
real tests can't be performed on 
patients, because at that stage

132
00:09:03,785 --> 00:09:07,691
the technology has neither been approved
yet by the regulatory authorities, nor

133
00:09:07,891 --> 00:09:10,625
has it demonstrated its compliance to applicable 
norms and standards. 

135
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:17,273
Nevertheless, many aspects can still
be tested. Without applying the

136
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:22,414
technology to actual patients.
Finally, we need to closely involve

137
00:09:22,614 --> 00:09:27,280
key opinion leaders and stakeholders
into our project early on.

138
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,483
This will not only improve our 
decision making, but also facilitate

139
00:09:31,683 --> 00:09:35,956
uptake of the solution later in the
implementation phase.

140
00:09:36,156 --> 00:09:40,001
However, we need to keep the
global objective in mind.

141
00:09:40,177 --> 00:09:43,177
Will our solution also be adapted to
all the communities?

142
00:09:43,377 --> 00:09:46,972
Because, what we want is as much of a global
impact as possible. 

143
00:09:47,172 --> 00:09:52,384
The two key deliverables in this
phase are: 1) a prototype of the

144
00:09:52,584 --> 00:09:56,861
technology demonstrating that it
is feasible, 2) a complete business

145
00:09:57,061 --> 00:10:02,028
model. Both deliverables are
closely related and they will have

146
00:10:02,228 --> 00:10:05,314
been subjected to as many real life tests
as possible. 

147
00:10:05,514 --> 00:10:09,476
At that stage we have to decide
between two main strategies.

148
00:10:09,676 --> 00:10:12,998
Either the technology will be
implemented by an existing company,

149
00:10:13,198 --> 00:10:16,363
or we decide to create our own
venture. 

150
00:10:16,563 --> 00:10:19,939
For the rest of this course we will
consider the second option.

151
00:10:20,139 --> 00:10:24,005
Yet the methodology applies equally
well if the implementation is made

152
00:10:24,205 --> 00:10:26,272
through an existing company.

153
00:10:26,472 --> 00:10:29,472
The last phase is when the rubber
hits the road.

154
00:10:29,672 --> 00:10:33,816
At that stage we have demonstrated
feasibility of both our technology

155
00:10:34,016 --> 00:10:38,278
and our business model. However,
it does not mean that there is no

156
00:10:38,478 --> 00:10:42,778
more risk involved, of course. But
it will have been reduced as much

157
00:10:42,978 --> 00:10:46,664
as possible. We can now go talk to
investors.

158
00:10:46,852 --> 00:10:50,450
They'll come on board if they foresee
a sufficient financial return.

159
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:54,374
And if the related level of risk
is deemed acceptable.

160
00:10:54,574 --> 00:10:59,177
The technology is then made into
an industrial product, which can be

161
00:10:59,377 --> 00:11:04,472
replicated and sold. It needs to be
made compliant to safety standards

162
00:11:04,672 --> 00:11:09,103
and regulatory constrains which can
be quite a lot of work. 

163
00:11:09,303 --> 00:11:14,506
The implementation of the business
model also requires resources,

164
00:11:14,706 --> 00:11:18,780
such as personnel, office space
and material.

165
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:23,773
The first crucial success will come 
when our initiative stops losing

166
00:11:23,973 --> 00:11:27,691
money and reaches what is called
break-even. 

167
00:11:27,891 --> 00:11:33,595
After that the more we grow and
scale up, the more our investors

168
00:11:33,795 --> 00:11:37,463
will be happy. And ideally the more
impact we will have.

169
00:11:37,663 --> 00:11:42,113
When investors are involved, the 
question of both maximizing

170
00:11:42,313 --> 00:11:46,784
sustainable impact and profitability
will always remain an important

171
00:11:46,984 --> 00:11:52,444
concern. Ideally, there needs to be
a direct link between the amounts

172
00:11:52,644 --> 00:11:56,355
of our technology deployed and
the impact generated.

173
00:11:56,555 --> 00:12:00,721
If this is the case, then the more
products we sell,

174
00:12:00,921 --> 00:12:02,750
the more impact we have.

175
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,764
This is a somewhat idealized
situation and things can derail

176
00:12:06,964 --> 00:12:11,665
very quickly. For example, when
our beneficial impact is outweighed

177
00:12:11,865 --> 00:12:15,608
by environmental concerns, or when
our initiative is finally so

178
00:12:15,808 --> 00:12:19,618
attractive in rich countries that
the initial intent to serve the poor

179
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:25,522
is lost. This is the reason why we
must closely monitor impact at

180
00:12:25,722 --> 00:12:30,010
all times. We will discuss this in
more details later.

181
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:33,995
Since accurately characterizing
impact often represents an important

182
00:12:34,195 --> 00:12:39,672
challenge. Finally, let's go back
and look at the whole process again.

183
00:12:39,872 --> 00:12:45,040
In general, as we said in the beginning
this is not a linear or smooth

184
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,397
process. And that is also what is
exciting about it.

185
00:12:48,597 --> 00:12:53,474
As we have said, this is about 
reducing risk and about learning.

186
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:58,510
As a consequence, the best practice
to remember is to make many tests,

187
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,869
fail often, fail cheap and
fail early. 

188
00:13:02,069 --> 00:13:06,177
We must make many rough and
ready trials. Both for the technology

189
00:13:06,377 --> 00:13:08,518
and the business model. 

190
00:13:08,718 --> 00:13:13,523
At all times, we must remain focused
on impact and have our impact

191
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:16,220
metrics defined in detail. 

192
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:20,028
All of this requires strong 
determination.

193
00:13:20,228 --> 00:13:25,429
You must be convinced that there's
not only plan A and plan B, but all

194
00:13:25,629 --> 00:13:28,184
of the 26 letters of the alphabet.

195
00:13:28,384 --> 00:13:31,277
If that's not enough, be ready to
start with the Chinese alphabet

196
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:36,292
as well. As a conclusion to this 
video, let me remind you of the

197
00:13:36,492 --> 00:13:39,787
three key guiding principles of
this process.

198
00:13:39,987 --> 00:13:44,240
1. This is a learning process. We
need to acquire knowledge to

199
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:48,505
mitigate risk. 
2. It requires cooperation.

200
00:13:48,705 --> 00:13:52,038
We need to involve local 
stakeholders and beneficiaries. 

201
00:13:52,238 --> 00:13:55,434
3. We need to be determined
and agile.

202
00:13:55,634 --> 00:14:00,601
We need to experiment a lot & adjust 
without losing sight of the goal.

203
00:14:00,801 --> 00:14:02,473
Goodbye.
