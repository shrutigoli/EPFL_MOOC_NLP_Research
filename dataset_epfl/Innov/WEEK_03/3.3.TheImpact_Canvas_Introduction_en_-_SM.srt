1
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:19,351
Today, the vast majority of ventures
bringing in 

2
00:00:19,551 --> 00:00:22,528
technology knowledge-based
innovation products to the market

3
00:00:22,686 --> 00:00:24,404
will develop a business plan

4
00:00:24,604 --> 00:00:26,528
at the very beginning
of the venture activity

5
00:00:26,728 --> 00:00:30,330
which is essentially a road map
that outlines the commercial goals

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:33,832
of the product, and details
how you plan to achieve these goals.

7
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:37,249
This includes the necessary
financial and human resources,

8
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:40,782
as well as a description
of key events, or milestones,

9
00:00:40,982 --> 00:00:43,407
that need to be achieved
along the way.

10
00:00:43,607 --> 00:00:46,292
Which also serve as indicators
of progress

11
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,983
towards the stated commercial goals.

12
00:00:49,293 --> 00:00:52,749
It is also well-known that
a business plan is a living thing.

13
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,315
In other words, it keeps changing
and needs to be updated

14
00:00:55,515 --> 00:00:57,065
several times along the way.

15
00:00:57,265 --> 00:01:00,373
The business plan also enables
the entrepreneur to estimate

16
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:03,573
and provide a quantitative
value of the company.

17
00:01:03,698 --> 00:01:05,890
Or what is termed,
Company Valuation.

18
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,444
Where the return on investment

19
00:01:07,644 --> 00:01:10,312
is one of the key metrics,
for example, that is used

20
00:01:10,512 --> 00:01:12,260
to estimate the potential valuations

21
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:17,726
and also in deciding which company
to invest in by investors.

22
00:01:17,926 --> 00:01:18,801
In general,

23
00:01:18,926 --> 00:01:21,043
any venture needs to be
commercially viable

24
00:01:21,168 --> 00:01:22,576
to be sustainable over time.

25
00:01:22,776 --> 00:01:25,112
As you may remember
this course aims to assist

26
00:01:25,312 --> 00:01:28,813
those wishing to develop innovations
that can make a contribution

27
00:01:28,875 --> 00:01:30,124
to sustainable development.

28
00:01:30,643 --> 00:01:33,543
Therefore, commercial success alone
is not sufficient.

29
00:01:33,743 --> 00:01:37,688
Positive social impact is also
equally important in that equation.

30
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:41,078
Now the business plan provides you
the blueprint

31
00:01:41,278 --> 00:01:42,929
for the commercial objective.

32
00:01:43,129 --> 00:01:47,233
Now how do you generate a blueprint
for assuring social impact?

33
00:01:47,433 --> 00:01:49,687
That's the crux of this lecture.

34
00:01:49,887 --> 00:01:54,124
Now the definition and measurement
of impact is by no means

35
00:01:54,324 --> 00:01:55,313
a trivial matter.

36
00:01:55,513 --> 00:01:56,178
However,

37
00:01:56,228 --> 00:01:59,083
there are specific methodologies
or tools that have been developed

38
00:01:59,151 --> 00:02:00,037
to address this.

39
00:02:00,237 --> 00:02:03,410
And we will spend the rest
of this lecture outlining them.

40
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,595
In order to ensure
that your innovation venture

41
00:02:06,795 --> 00:02:08,800
provides a positive social benefit,

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,837
it is necessary that you define
the long term goals or impact

43
00:02:13,037 --> 00:02:16,022
you desire, at the very onset
of your activities.

44
00:02:16,222 --> 00:02:20,273
If you are unclear on this,
take the time to carry a research

45
00:02:20,473 --> 00:02:22,316
to understand what it is exactly

46
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:25,291
that you wish to achieve in society
with your innovation

47
00:02:25,391 --> 00:02:26,496
in the long term.

48
00:02:26,696 --> 00:02:29,772
Here, beware of the common trap
with new technologies.

49
00:02:29,909 --> 00:02:32,256
That is a hammer looking for a nail.

50
00:02:32,456 --> 00:02:33,283
In other words,

51
00:02:33,483 --> 00:02:37,570
a new technology looking
for an application or social impact.

52
00:02:37,770 --> 00:02:41,025
Make sure to confirm
as meticulously as you can

53
00:02:41,225 --> 00:02:45,120
that there is a match between
your innovation and the impact

54
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,745
you wish for.

55
00:02:46,945 --> 00:02:49,270
Once you have defined
your long-term goals

56
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,009
or desired impact,

57
00:02:51,209 --> 00:02:54,237
you need to spell out in detail
the sequence of events to get there.

58
00:02:54,437 --> 00:02:55,054
In other words,

59
00:02:55,254 --> 00:02:56,686
much like the business plan,

60
00:02:56,886 --> 00:02:59,886
you need to generate an impact
framework plan,

61
00:03:00,086 --> 00:03:01,375
or impact value chain,

62
00:03:01,575 --> 00:03:04,800
as your blueprint
to impact attainment.

63
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,963
One of the most widely used methods

64
00:03:07,163 --> 00:03:10,018
to help you map out
your impact framework plan,

65
00:03:10,218 --> 00:03:11,587
or impact value chain,

66
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:14,150
is one that is known as
the Theory of Change.

67
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,545
What is theory of change, exactly?

68
00:03:16,745 --> 00:03:18,738
Theory of Change, or simply ToC,

69
00:03:18,938 --> 00:03:21,938
is essentially a comprehensive
description and illustration

70
00:03:22,138 --> 00:03:24,552
of how and why a desired change

71
00:03:24,752 --> 00:03:27,694
is expected to happen
in a particular context.

72
00:03:27,894 --> 00:03:31,657
You develop your theory of change
by first identifying

73
00:03:31,857 --> 00:03:35,054
the desired long-term goals
or impact.

74
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:37,044
And then working backwards

75
00:03:37,244 --> 00:03:38,524
to identify and define

76
00:03:38,724 --> 00:03:42,693
all the necessary and sufficient
conditions or sequence of events

77
00:03:42,893 --> 00:03:44,738
that are required
and must be in place

78
00:03:44,938 --> 00:03:46,307
for the impact to occur.

79
00:03:46,507 --> 00:03:48,479
This gives rise

80
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:51,921
to a set of sequential
interdependent outcomes

81
00:03:52,121 --> 00:03:54,359
that are sometimes
termed collectively

82
00:03:54,559 --> 00:03:56,402
as a "Pathway of Change".

83
00:03:57,295 --> 00:03:59,319
In the next slide,

84
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,334
we illustrate the canvas tool

85
00:04:01,534 --> 00:04:04,752
for describing
this process systematically.

86
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:06,162
Globally,

87
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,009
your impact framework,
or impact value chain canvas,

88
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:10,751
can be thought of as two parts:

89
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:14,089
The organization's planned work
or interventions

90
00:04:14,289 --> 00:04:17,873
and the organization's intended
results and changes.

91
00:04:18,073 --> 00:04:21,019
In order to construct the full
impact framework,

92
00:04:21,086 --> 00:04:22,556
or impact value chain,

93
00:04:22,756 --> 00:04:25,864
it actually requires 5 steps
or stages.

94
00:04:26,064 --> 00:04:28,766
The first stage is inputs.

95
00:04:28,966 --> 00:04:32,327
Which can be defined as
the resources that must be deployed

96
00:04:32,527 --> 00:04:35,574
in order to enable
the implementation of tasks.

97
00:04:35,774 --> 00:04:39,977
This could be human, financial
or other types of resources.

98
00:04:40,152 --> 00:04:45,215
The second stage is to specify
a set of actions or tasks

99
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:49,000
that your enterprise or organization
needs to perform

100
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:53,107
in order to help realize
and support your impact objectives.

101
00:04:53,307 --> 00:04:55,723
These are collectively known
as Activities.

102
00:04:55,923 --> 00:04:59,881
The third stage is to specify
your expected outputs

103
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:02,791
which can be defined as the tangible
products and services

104
00:05:02,991 --> 00:05:06,573
that result from the activities
undertaken.

105
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:09,592
And the fourth stage
is your expected outcomes,

106
00:05:09,792 --> 00:05:12,783
which essentially refers
to the changes or effects

107
00:05:12,983 --> 00:05:16,608
on individuals or the environment
that you expect to follow

108
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:20,074
from the delivery
of products and services.

109
00:05:20,274 --> 00:05:24,746
Then we come to the impact,
which are the effects and/or changes

110
00:05:24,946 --> 00:05:28,594
in society or the environment
that follow from the outcomes

111
00:05:28,794 --> 00:05:30,979
that have been achieved.

112
00:05:31,179 --> 00:05:34,179
Now in putting together
your impact framework,

113
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:36,503
there are various assumptions

114
00:05:36,703 --> 00:05:39,489
you need to make at every stage
of the process.

115
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:41,626
The question that always arises is

116
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:44,211
whether these were
the right assumptions.

117
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:45,590
In other words,

118
00:05:45,727 --> 00:05:47,388
did these assumptions provide

119
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:50,767
all the necessary and sufficient
conditions at every stage

120
00:05:50,967 --> 00:05:55,464
to ensure successful progression
to the impact objective?

121
00:05:55,664 --> 00:05:59,068
As we move down the framework
and produce outcomes,

122
00:05:59,268 --> 00:06:02,848
it remains necessary
to check and explain

123
00:06:03,048 --> 00:06:04,990
if and why they are necessary.

124
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,665
We also have another
very important step.

125
00:06:08,865 --> 00:06:13,989
Which is to measure and monitor
the implementation and effectiveness

126
00:06:14,189 --> 00:06:15,657
of our initiative.

127
00:06:15,857 --> 00:06:19,587
By collecting data
on each segment of the chain,

128
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:24,397
the initiative can identify
what is or is not happening

129
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:25,574
and find out why.

130
00:06:25,774 --> 00:06:30,986
This may require interrogating your
assumptions and modifying them

131
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:33,129
accordingly, if required.

132
00:06:33,329 --> 00:06:36,718
Now in order to carry out
your measurement and monitoring

133
00:06:36,918 --> 00:06:38,167
of your progress,

134
00:06:38,367 --> 00:06:40,874
you need to establish
suitable indicators.

135
00:06:41,074 --> 00:06:46,281
An indicator is basically a metric
that provides information

136
00:06:46,481 --> 00:06:49,308
to monitor performance
and measure achievement.

137
00:06:49,508 --> 00:06:53,460
It tracks information
about outputs and outcomes

138
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,369
and includes quantitative
and qualitative data.

139
00:06:56,569 --> 00:06:59,690
Your indicators should be specific,

140
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:03,827
simple and practical,
and show changes over time.

141
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:08,118
Try and use established
standard indicators where possible.

142
00:07:08,318 --> 00:07:12,912
The list and guidance on indicators
is provided in the references.

143
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:14,813
However, in general,

144
00:07:15,013 --> 00:07:17,796
be aware that the ability
to collect good quality data

145
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:19,920
about social performance
of a project,

146
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,359
can be a major challenge.

147
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:24,591
This can be a complex
and costly process,

148
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,227
which has had the effect
of deterring and discouraging

149
00:07:27,427 --> 00:07:29,826
many enterprises and organizations

150
00:07:30,026 --> 00:07:32,116
from doing it well,
or doing it at all.

151
00:07:32,316 --> 00:07:36,961
We will now try and illustrate
the impact framework concept,

152
00:07:37,048 --> 00:07:39,637
which a rather simple example.

153
00:07:40,148 --> 00:07:42,327
Let's go over these five components

154
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:46,116
and we will use a highly simplified
example to illustrate them.

155
00:07:46,316 --> 00:07:49,167
The first thing to do
is to define the impact

156
00:07:49,367 --> 00:07:53,623
you wish to have in a specified,
defined social group or community.

157
00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:55,163
Now in our example,

158
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:55,972
we have a problem

159
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,963
of high proportions
of overweight teenagers

160
00:07:58,051 --> 00:07:59,179
in a certain village.

161
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,552
Overweight levels
have been determined

162
00:08:01,752 --> 00:08:04,379
from the Body Mass Index,
or BMI,

163
00:08:04,604 --> 00:08:08,681
BMI is obtained from the height
and mass of a person

164
00:08:08,881 --> 00:08:15,711
as a ratio of mass in kilograms over
the square of your height in meters.

165
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:20,090
So our long-term objective,
or social impact,

166
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:24,059
is to reduce teenage obesity
in this village.

167
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:27,381
So our theory of change statement
becomes:

168
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:32,060
If teenagers receive a football
and football lessons,

169
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:34,846
offered by football icons,
for example,

170
00:08:35,046 --> 00:08:36,939
then they would start
playing football,

171
00:08:37,139 --> 00:08:40,482
and if the village teenagers
play football regularly

172
00:08:40,682 --> 00:08:45,215
then they will lose weight,
and teenage obesity will be reduced,

173
00:08:45,415 --> 00:08:48,274
which is the desired impact.

174
00:08:48,474 --> 00:08:53,835
Now let's try our theory of change
statement into an impact framework,

175
00:08:53,998 --> 00:08:55,882
which is comprised of 5 stages.

176
00:08:56,082 --> 00:08:58,533
After defining the problem well,

177
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:01,349
the first stage
of the impact framework is inputs.

178
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:03,363
Which can be defined
as the resources

179
00:09:03,563 --> 00:09:07,294
that are deployed in order to enable
the implementation of tasks.

180
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,273
In our simple example,

181
00:09:09,410 --> 00:09:13,907
we define the resources needed
as the availability of footballs,

182
00:09:14,107 --> 00:09:15,438
fields for playing,

183
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,798
and financial resources
to pay for these.

184
00:09:18,998 --> 00:09:21,883
The next thing we need to specify
is activities.

185
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:27,367
Which can be defined as the actions
and/or tasks that must be performed

186
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,013
in support of specific
impact objectives.

187
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:32,201
In our example,

188
00:09:32,401 --> 00:09:35,847
this could be actions undertaken
to produce sufficient footballs,

189
00:09:36,047 --> 00:09:38,822
one football for every child,

190
00:09:39,022 --> 00:09:42,240
and to attract teenagers to come,

191
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:45,681
such as by carrying out
a publicity campaign

192
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:46,936
that, for example,

193
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:49,754
may include the participation
of famous football icons

194
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:53,678
in the region, who pledge
to come and give football lessons.

195
00:09:54,428 --> 00:09:55,155
After that,

196
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:58,307
we must describe the outputs,

197
00:09:58,507 --> 00:10:02,695
which can be defined
as the tangible immediate practices,

198
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:08,797
products and services that result
from the activities undertaken.

199
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:13,941
In our example, this could be,one,
footballs autographed

200
00:10:14,088 --> 00:10:15,775
by the football icons,

201
00:10:15,975 --> 00:10:18,397
which are available for distribution

202
00:10:18,597 --> 00:10:20,458
to every teenager

203
00:10:20,658 --> 00:10:23,658
as part of our "one child,
one football" campaign.

204
00:10:23,858 --> 00:10:28,906
And, two, the number of teenagers
registered for lessons and teams

205
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:31,488
following the publicity campaign.

206
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:33,927
Then we define the outcomes,

207
00:10:34,127 --> 00:10:36,482
which essentially refers
to the changes

208
00:10:36,682 --> 00:10:39,585
or effects on individuals
or the environment

209
00:10:39,785 --> 00:10:43,000
that follow from the delivery
of products and services.

210
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,573
In our example,

211
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:49,217
the key outcome would be the change
in the amount of time the teenagers

212
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:54,462
now spend playing football, instead
of being couch potatoes at home.

213
00:10:54,662 --> 00:10:57,662
We then need to establish
our impact drivers.

214
00:10:57,862 --> 00:11:02,584
That is, what are we going to do
in order to influence, or to ensure,

215
00:11:02,784 --> 00:11:06,142
that this outcome
is indeed achieved?

216
00:11:06,342 --> 00:11:07,218
For example,

217
00:11:07,418 --> 00:11:10,418
we might provide a pickup service
that comes to pick up

218
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:14,370
each of the registered kids
at certain times during the week.

219
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:20,481
Then we come to the impact,
which are the effects or changes

220
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:25,774
in society or the environment
that follow from the outcomes

221
00:11:25,974 --> 00:11:27,908
that have been achieved.

222
00:11:28,108 --> 00:11:29,331
In our case,

223
00:11:29,531 --> 00:11:31,672
the impact desired
would be the reduction

224
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,084
in teenage obesity
and overweight levels

225
00:11:34,284 --> 00:11:38,359
as well as the continued
enjoyment of playing football.

226
00:11:38,559 --> 00:11:39,875
So overall,

227
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:41,508
the theory of change process

228
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:44,603
enables better planning,
and better evaluation,

229
00:11:44,803 --> 00:11:47,613
and even allows the possibility
to also measure progress

230
00:11:47,813 --> 00:11:51,532
towards the achievement
of longer term goals

231
00:11:51,732 --> 00:11:56,028
that go beyond the identification
of program outputs.

232
00:11:56,228 --> 00:11:57,598
In the next lecture,

233
00:11:57,798 --> 00:12:00,648
we will try and illustrate
this methodology

234
00:12:00,848 --> 00:12:03,762
with a concrete example
involving the GDX,

235
00:12:03,962 --> 00:12:06,768
Digital X-ray Imaging system.

236
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,928
Goodbye.
