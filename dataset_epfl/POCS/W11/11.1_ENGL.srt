00:00:04,024 --> 00:00:07,504
Welcome to this topic on 
data center systems or, more specifically,

2
00:00:07,527 --> 00:00:11,527
on a few selected areas in the area of
data centers and data center systems.

3
00:00:11,998 --> 00:00:14,947
Now, data centers are not new,
they emerged with the first enterprise

4
00:00:14,947 --> 00:00:18,022
mainframes and have
been housing data ever since.

5
00:00:18,647 --> 00:00:21,617
But there was a significant 
change of scale about a decade ago

6
00:00:21,617 --> 00:00:24,745
with the emergence of Mega Data Centers, 
as pioneered by Google.

7
00:00:25,581 --> 00:00:28,957
The Data Center was no longer a machine
room within an existing building,

8
00:00:28,957 --> 00:00:32,701
but was a building of its own 
and with this change of scale

9
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:35,545
came a change of mindset.

10
00:00:35,545 --> 00:00:39,190
The Data Center was no longer the place
in which you had multiple independent

11
00:00:39,316 --> 00:00:43,641
computer systems, but the Data
Center itself became a system of its own.

12
00:00:44,265 --> 00:00:46,739
So let's try to see what that 
actually can mean.

13
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:50,579
What it can actually, specifically mean 
to run a Mega Data Center today.

14
00:00:51,189 --> 00:00:55,449
Now this slide is from a 2012 
presentation by James Hamilton,

15
00:00:55,449 --> 00:00:58,269
and Hamilton was a very 
well-respected researcher

16
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:01,089
who is currently responsible 
for networking architecture

17
00:01:01,089 --> 00:01:02,174
at Amazon.

18
00:01:02,704 --> 00:01:06,871
So let me read it to you: 
Each day Amazon Web Services

19
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:11,005
adds enough new capacity to support 
all of Amazon.com's

20
00:01:11,005 --> 00:01:13,971
global infrastructure through 
the company's first five years

21
00:01:13,971 --> 00:01:19,457
when it was a $2.7 billion dollar 
annual revenue enterprise.

22
00:01:20,007 --> 00:01:24,145
So - Amazon itself was started in 1994,
so Hamilton is referring to the period

23
00:01:24,145 --> 00:01:29,389
between 1994 and 1999 and 
the aggregate compute capacity

24
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:31,473
deployed during those five years.

25
00:01:31,523 --> 00:01:34,599
And he's comparing it with
the incremental daily capacity

26
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,330
of Amazon today.

27
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:40,531
So whenever I use this slide in a public
talk, I usually read the quote twice,

28
00:01:40,584 --> 00:01:44,624
to make sure the significance of 
the statement actually sinks in.

29
00:01:44,943 --> 00:01:48,220
Hamilton is comparing 
five years of aggregate capacity

30
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,835
with what is being deployed
on an incremental daily basis

31
00:01:52,295 --> 00:01:54,700
every single day
at Amazon today.

32
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,545
So, since this is not a live lecture, 
but on tape, I'll have you

33
00:01:57,545 --> 00:02:00,865
rewind until the significance 
of the statement sinks in.

34
00:02:00,911 --> 00:02:04,116
So how do we explain
such a phenomenal disruption?

35
00:02:04,798 --> 00:02:07,890
Whenever something appears 
too large to be true,

36
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,389
it sometimes helps to step back 
and try to think about it from

37
00:02:11,389 --> 00:02:14,278
a 'first principles,' 
or axiomatic perspective.

38
00:02:14,278 --> 00:02:17,769
Here I selected three axioms, 
three 'first principles'

39
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:20,530
that can explain the trend.

40
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:24,061
My selection is somewhat
arbitrary, and you'll notice that

41
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:28,151
they're not principles in the sense of the
Principles of Computer Systems

42
00:02:28,151 --> 00:02:30,007
that we've been studying in class so far.

43
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:34,078
Instead, one of them is about
semiconductor density

44
00:02:34,078 --> 00:02:37,209
and the other two are 
fundamental principles of economics.

45
00:02:38,015 --> 00:02:42,511
So first, Moore's Law, which is about
semiconductor density,

46
00:02:42,511 --> 00:02:47,453
implies that new applications are possible
with every new generation of silicon.

47
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:51,396
Things that were not possible a few
years ago are now possible

48
00:02:51,396 --> 00:02:55,482
because of Moore's Law - our cell phones, 
our tablets, are possible today

49
00:02:55,482 --> 00:03:00,070
because we are operating with
ever-increasing silicon densities.

50
00:03:00,946 --> 00:03:05,482
Now the second law simply says that
innovation is expensive

51
00:03:05,482 --> 00:03:09,652
and that ongoing innovation can only be
justified when there is high volume.

52
00:03:10,243 --> 00:03:14,430
Said differently, it is relatively easy to
justify innovating once

53
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,802
and much harder to justify innovating 
on a constant basis,

54
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:21,143
unless there is a 
real high volume application.

55
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,965
The third law states, generically, that
economies of scale can be achieved once

56
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:32,621
a delivery process is automated and the
product becomes a commodity, or utility.

57
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:37,054
This is true, for example, when
energy became ubiquitous

58
00:03:37,054 --> 00:03:39,183
as part of the Industrial Revolution.

59
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:42,556
So we can think about these three
principles as axioms

60
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:45,816
that are going to be true 
in space and in time.

61
00:03:45,816 --> 00:03:49,515
What's interesting here is to study 
how these axiom apply

62
00:03:49,515 --> 00:03:54,254
to the Data Center transformation;
and let's first study Moore's law.

63
00:03:55,514 --> 00:03:59,364
Now we've learned to scale horizontally
across more and more cores,

64
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:02,078
because the cores themselves 
are not getting any faster.

65
00:04:02,618 --> 00:04:04,245
Now this has been possible, in part,

66
00:04:04,245 --> 00:04:08,450
because Moore's law also applies to
networking, and we now have ASICs

67
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:10,644
with high port count 
to switch between servers,

68
00:04:10,644 --> 00:04:13,924
so we can put together a larger number 
of servers in a machine room

69
00:04:13,924 --> 00:04:17,832
and build effective applications 
because these servers can effectively

70
00:04:17,832 --> 00:04:20,480
and efficiently communicate with each other.

71
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:23,010
Actually in this area, Moore's Law 
is sufficiently effective.

72
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,429
The switching logic of 
the networking switches

73
00:04:26,429 --> 00:04:30,439
is no longer the bottleneck, and instead,
complications in transmission

74
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:34,505
and coding are actually limiting 
the increase in speed in bandwidth

75
00:04:34,505 --> 00:04:36,160
and Data Centers today.

76
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,635
But Moore's law applies to much more 
than simply processing -

77
00:04:39,955 --> 00:04:43,937
it applies to memory, 
and memory is now sufficiently dense

78
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:47,659
that everything that matters, 
in effect, is in memory.

79
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:50,943
Here is an example:
the Facebook social graph,

80
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:54,122
which is quite large, 
is stored in memory.

81
00:04:54,122 --> 00:04:59,119
Not on the memory of a single server, 
but in the memory of a data center.

82
00:04:59,119 --> 00:05:05,436
Finally, Moore's Law applies to Solid State, 
as well, which are quickly replacing

83
00:05:05,436 --> 00:05:08,203
hard disc drives for durable storage 
in theData Center,

84
00:05:08,203 --> 00:05:12,145
as least for all forms of structured data 
so you're relational database

85
00:05:12,145 --> 00:05:16,941
is no longer stored on rotating drives, 
but instead on much, much more efficient

86
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:20,227
Solid State drives -
again, because of Moore's Law.

87
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:25,165
So now let's look at the second axiom -
the notion that volume

88
00:05:25,165 --> 00:05:27,552
drives sustainable innovation.

89
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:31,266
Now, one thing to keep in mind is that,
even though data centers

90
00:05:31,266 --> 00:05:35,155
are extremely large today, 
they remain a niche,

91
00:05:35,755 --> 00:05:39,632
in the sense that there are much fewer 
computers in data centers,

92
00:05:39,632 --> 00:05:46,249
that we actually have computers in our
pockets, or carrying with us on our desks.

93
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:50,698
So, to be effective, modern Data Centers
are pragmatically built

94
00:05:50,698 --> 00:05:53,530
using commodity components 
that were designed

95
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:57,490
with other applications in mind, 
and so we're leveraging the volume

96
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:02,132
of other applications in order to 
effectively build data centers.

97
00:06:02,132 --> 00:06:05,374
Let me give an example - X86 chips 
were designed for desktops.

98
00:06:05,724 --> 00:06:08,076
This was true and is still true today.

99
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,851
The desktop business at Intel drives
the main innovation in X86 chips

100
00:06:11,851 --> 00:06:15,043
and the server line, 
which Intel calls "Xeon,"

101
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:19,336
basically leverages and fine-tunes 
that innovation for server application,

102
00:06:19,336 --> 00:06:21,059
not the other way around.

103
00:06:21,059 --> 00:06:24,112
Desktops is driving innovation in servers.

104
00:06:24,112 --> 00:06:27,490
So if you follow the logic, 
why not use cell phone chips

105
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:28,728
in data centers?

106
00:06:28,728 --> 00:06:31,908
After all, they're much more power-efficient 
than desktop chips,

107
00:06:31,908 --> 00:06:34,862
and there's actually precisely 
an active line of research

108
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:37,456
and development along that path.

109
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:41,431
Now, although this may sound
obvious, keep in mind that this is only

110
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:45,429
representative of modern 
cloud-scale data centers.

111
00:06:46,059 --> 00:06:48,895
Your typical data center 
has a very different mix.

112
00:06:48,895 --> 00:06:52,329
Rather than using desktop 
or cell phone chips,

113
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:56,853
enterprise data centers still have a lot 
of legacy servers and legacy technologies.

114
00:06:57,423 --> 00:07:03,659
In 2011, the X86 server market 
was only 50% of the dollar value

115
00:07:03,659 --> 00:07:05,798
of the total server market.

116
00:07:06,378 --> 00:07:11,961
The other 50% went to legacy technologies,
such as mainframe and RIS computers.

117
00:07:12,681 --> 00:07:16,309
Now, similarly, enterprise data centers 
use a combination of

118
00:07:16,309 --> 00:07:18,716
networking technologies,
things like Fibre Channel,

119
00:07:18,716 --> 00:07:23,543
whereas cloud-scale data centers 
only use the same Ethernet standard

120
00:07:23,543 --> 00:07:26,330
that is ubiquitous in campus network.

121
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,687
So here is another example 
where we are leveraging volume

122
00:07:29,687 --> 00:07:32,514
of technologies deployed 
for a broader application,

123
00:07:32,514 --> 00:07:35,771
in order to build a cost-effective 
data center.

124
00:07:35,771 --> 00:07:39,398
This actually has 
a significant implication,

125
00:07:40,318 --> 00:07:43,405
and that is because the 
Law of Sustainable Innovation applies .

126
00:07:43,555 --> 00:07:46,653
Because cloud data centers
are built using commodity parts,

127
00:07:46,653 --> 00:07:50,043
the price performance gap, 
with the classic solution

128
00:07:50,043 --> 00:07:52,113
increases every year.

129
00:07:52,623 --> 00:07:55,839
Now let's shift to the third axiom 
that can explain the rise

130
00:07:55,839 --> 00:07:58,005
in cloud-scale data centers.

131
00:07:58,005 --> 00:08:01,561
And it is that they're actually 
engineered as a system

132
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:05,151
that can deliver some utility at scale.

133
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:09,585
So consider the picture on the left, 
of the hydroelectric dam.

134
00:08:09,585 --> 00:08:12,604
The picture is actually from 
the Grande Dixence in Valais.

135
00:08:12,604 --> 00:08:15,109
One of the largest dam 
of its type in the world,

136
00:08:15,109 --> 00:08:19,316
and the pride of Swiss civil engineering, 
and it delivers a utility,

137
00:08:19,316 --> 00:08:22,643
which is hydroelectric 
electricity at scale.

138
00:08:23,293 --> 00:08:27,130
Now, the picture on the right 
is a new Facebook data center,

139
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,587
somewhere in Oregon.

140
00:08:28,587 --> 00:08:34,016
It is also engineered to deliver a
utility, the social network,

141
00:08:34,016 --> 00:08:36,196
at a very large scale.

142
00:08:36,196 --> 00:08:41,116
Similarly, Amazon's data centers 
are also designed to deliver a utility,

143
00:08:41,116 --> 00:08:43,892
infrastructure as a service,
or cloud computing,

144
00:08:43,892 --> 00:08:47,508
or virtual machines, at a massive scale.

145
00:08:47,508 --> 00:08:50,576
And put together these 
three underlying technologies

146
00:08:50,576 --> 00:08:53,665
and economic principles 
have serious implications.

147
00:08:53,665 --> 00:08:55,837
We have Moore's Law, 
we have the notion

148
00:08:55,837 --> 00:08:59,568
that volume drives 
sustainable innovation.

149
00:08:59,568 --> 00:09:01,689
We have the notion of economies of scale 
and delivery.

150
00:09:01,689 --> 00:09:04,661
Now, let's think about what 
the implications are this time,

151
00:09:04,661 --> 00:09:07,924
from the perspective of the domain 
of computer systems.

152
00:09:08,274 --> 00:09:10,776
And the implication is that 
there is a massive

153
00:09:10,776 --> 00:09:13,798
architectural disruption that is going on.

154
00:09:14,478 --> 00:09:17,961
In particular, when comparing 
a traditional enterprise infrastructure

155
00:09:18,451 --> 00:09:20,624
with a cloud infrastructure.

156
00:09:20,624 --> 00:09:23,119
So on the left, the enterprise 
architectural model

157
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:26,092
was built around the notion that 
individual computer systems

158
00:09:26,092 --> 00:09:28,775
had to be: resilient,
available and serviceable.

159
00:09:29,115 --> 00:09:34,000
In contrast, data center systems 
just let the various components fail,

160
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,105
unrepaired, in lights-out data centers.

161
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:39,839
If a server in a Google 
machine room fails,

162
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,993
it is simply going to be left in place, 
powered off.

163
00:09:44,903 --> 00:09:49,089
We've build 50 years of transactional 
database systems based around

164
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:52,560
the notion of ACID transactions, 
and the notion that

165
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,751
important data was on disc.

166
00:09:54,751 --> 00:09:57,993
In the cloud, important data 
is in memory and this data

167
00:09:57,993 --> 00:10:02,122
is often replicated on 
a weekly consistent basis.

168
00:10:02,992 --> 00:10:06,340
The enterprise infrastructure model 
has a lot of legacy technologies

169
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:08,850
that were designed at the time 
when data was on disc.

170
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,660
The cloud is shifting toward a model 
where everything is in memory.

171
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,772
Finally, the classic model consists of 
individually provisioned components

172
00:10:16,772 --> 00:10:21,534
that act as independent systems with, 
typically, three completely

173
00:10:21,534 --> 00:10:25,153
indistinct operational teams responsible
for their management.

174
00:10:25,153 --> 00:10:28,234
The application team, which manages
the individual servers;

175
00:10:28,234 --> 00:10:30,615
the networking team, 
which manages the network;

176
00:10:30,615 --> 00:10:33,156
and the storage team, 
which actually manages the data

177
00:10:33,156 --> 00:10:35,219
separately from the applications.

178
00:10:35,219 --> 00:10:37,727
Now in the cloud, 
there is no such concept,

179
00:10:37,727 --> 00:10:40,065
since everything is automated.

180
00:10:40,065 --> 00:10:43,059
In other words, the configuration 
of the data center itself

181
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:45,963
is entirely done in software.

182
00:10:46,293 --> 00:10:50,647
Now in the next modules, we will discuss
the implication of this disruption

183
00:10:50,967 --> 00:10:54,470
and we'll specifically talk about some of the
design principles associated

184
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:57,506
with building these cloud-scale applications.

185
00:10:57,506 --> 00:11:00,489
But to summarize this module 
on infrastructure,

186
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:04,402
there's a lot of hype about a cloud 
but below the cloud,

187
00:11:04,402 --> 00:11:06,717
realize that there is a new data center.

188
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:09,847
And that new data center 
is built on a certain set of principles.

189
00:11:09,847 --> 00:11:14,087
It is designed to operate at scale 
and it is designed to operate as

190
00:11:14,087 --> 00:11:18,869
a system, and to deliver
a utility at a massive scale.

191
00:11:18,869 --> 00:11:21,750
If you're interested in going further
into those topics,

192
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,742
I can recommend to you two books.

193
00:11:23,742 --> 00:11:28,494
One by Barrozo and Hötzle,
two of the leading engineers at Google,

194
00:11:28,494 --> 00:11:32,127
who've written a book on warehouse-scale
data center systems

195
00:11:32,127 --> 00:11:34,470
that summarizes their experience at Google.

196
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:37,353
And the second book by Nicholas Carr, 
called "The Big Switch,"

197
00:11:37,353 --> 00:11:40,866
which makes the analogy between the
emergence of the mega data centers

198
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:45,000
and the emergence of 
the electricity grid, about a century ago.
