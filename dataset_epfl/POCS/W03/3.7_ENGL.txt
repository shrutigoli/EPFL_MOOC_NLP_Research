We will now discuss an alternative Internet architecture proposed by David Cheriton in year 2000.
It was meant to improve the performance of Internet applications, and at the same time, solve the problem of IPv4 address depletion.
Interestingly, it would achieve both of these goals by changing certain aspects of the naming used by the TCP/IP stack.
Let's see how that was supposed to work.
So, TRIAD addressed to fundamental 
Internet problems by changing certain aspects of the naming used by the TCP/IP stack.
It would decrease connection set-up time by merging the host-name resolution path to the communication path.
And it would solve the IPv4 address depletion problem by making the namespace of IP addresses local, instead of global.
It is a nice demonstration of how naming can affect both the performance, and the scalability of systems.
