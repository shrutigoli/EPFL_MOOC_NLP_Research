We will now look at the basic name-mapping algorithms used by computer systems.
First, we have Table lookup.
So, we have looked at three basic name-mapping algorithms:
"Table lookup, Recursive lookup, and Multiple lookup."
These three algorithms differ in the number of contexts that they consider, and in the way in which they consider these contexts.
Table lookup maps a name to a value, using a single context.
Recursive lookup maps a sequence of names to values using a different context at each step.
Multiple lookup maps a name to a value after searching in many different contexts.
