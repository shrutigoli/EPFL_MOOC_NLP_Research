00:00:04,403 --> 00:00:07,503
We will now discuss an 
alternative Internet architecture

2
00:00:07,503 --> 00:00:10,103
proposed by David Cheriton in year 2000.

3
00:00:10,832 --> 00:00:14,072
It was meant to improve the performance 
of Internet applications,

4
00:00:14,072 --> 00:00:18,762
and at the same time, solve the problem 
of IPv4 address depletion.

5
00:00:19,382 --> 00:00:23,382
Interestingly, it would achieve 
both of these goals by changing

6
00:00:23,382 --> 00:00:27,122
certain aspects of the naming 
used by the TCP/IP stack.

7
00:00:27,473 --> 00:00:29,503
Let's see how that was supposed to work.

8
00:00:29,895 --> 00:00:34,745
So, TRIAD addressed to fundamental 
Internet problems by changing

9
00:00:34,745 --> 00:00:37,885
certain aspects of the naming 
used by the TCP/IP stack.

10
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:42,969
It would decrease connection set-up time 
by merging the host-name resolution path

11
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:44,419
to the communication path.

12
00:00:44,714 --> 00:00:48,304
And it would solve the IPv4 address 
depletion problem by making

13
00:00:48,304 --> 00:00:51,764
the namespace of IP addresses 
local, instead of global.

14
00:00:51,764 --> 00:00:55,764
It is a nice demonstration of how naming 
can affect both the performance,

15
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:58,034
and the scalability of systems.
