00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:07,366
We are discussing Butler Lampson's
name service,

2
00:00:07,366 --> 00:00:09,131
and the second design goal for the system

3
00:00:09,131 --> 00:00:10,979
is reliability.

4
00:00:10,979 --> 00:00:12,930
Whenever a user looks up a name,

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,774
that should be successfully resolved

6
00:00:14,774 --> 00:00:17,661
even in the face
of infrastructure problems.

7
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:19,587
Let's see how that is achieved.

8
00:00:19,597 --> 00:00:21,875
So far, we have seen that,
to its users,

9
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:23,963
the name service exposes the view

10
00:00:23,963 --> 00:00:25,909
of a directory tree.

11
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:27,585
Under the covers, however,

12
00:00:27,585 --> 00:00:29,989
things are quite different.

13
00:00:29,989 --> 00:00:33,243
Each directory is stored
into multiple servers,

14
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:35,189
and each server maintains its own copy

15
00:00:35,189 --> 00:00:36,994
of the directory contents.

16
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:40,277
Now let's zoom into the internals
of the SRC directory.

17
00:00:41,447 --> 00:00:44,487
In the previous slide,
I implied that all copies

18
00:00:44,487 --> 00:00:47,325
of the same directory
always have the same content.

19
00:00:47,325 --> 00:00:49,517
In reality this may not be the case,

20
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:52,287
because different servers
may see different updates.

21
00:00:52,287 --> 00:00:55,251
That is, different changes
to the directory content.

22
00:00:55,251 --> 00:00:58,012
For example, suppose that at some point

23
00:00:58,012 --> 00:01:00,249
the three directory copies look like this.

24
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:02,016
Then three updates occurred.

25
00:01:02,016 --> 00:01:04,412
Update A reached all servers.

26
00:01:04,412 --> 00:01:07,163
Update B reached only server gamma.

27
00:01:07,163 --> 00:01:10,590
And Update C
reached servers alpha and gamma.

28
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:13,106
So, it is possible that
the directory copies

29
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:14,510
become desynchronized.

30
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:16,130
Which means that we need a mechanism

31
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,495
to periodically resynchronize them.

32
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:21,570
This mechanism is called a sweep.

33
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:24,109
And it periodically
reads all the new updates

34
00:01:24,109 --> 00:01:26,777
from directory copies and writes them back

35
00:01:26,777 --> 00:01:28,741
to all directory copies.

36
00:01:28,741 --> 00:01:30,538
Let us see this visually.

37
00:01:30,538 --> 00:01:33,822
The sweep arrives at server alpha,

38
00:01:33,822 --> 00:01:37,896
reads the blue and orange updates
that have reached the server,

39
00:01:37,896 --> 00:01:42,328
then moves on to server beta,
where there are no new updates to read.

40
00:01:44,368 --> 00:01:46,276
Then moves on to server gamma,

41
00:01:46,276 --> 00:01:47,893
where it reads the green update.

42
00:01:49,053 --> 00:01:51,744
Each sweep has a timestamp
associated with it.

43
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:53,527
In this example it is five.

44
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:55,544
And every time it reads from
a directory copy,

45
00:01:55,544 --> 00:01:58,536
it marks the directory copy
with its timestamp.

46
00:01:58,536 --> 00:02:00,903
After reading all directory copies,

47
00:02:00,903 --> 00:02:03,818
the sweep circles back to the beginning,

48
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:07,478
and writes to each server the updates
that the server is missing.

49
00:02:07,478 --> 00:02:10,325
Every time the sweep
writes the directory copy,

50
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:13,972
it marks again that copy
with its timestamp.

51
00:02:13,972 --> 00:02:18,064
So, reliability is achieved
through redundancy.

52
00:02:18,064 --> 00:02:21,368
Each directory is copied
into multiple servers,

53
00:02:21,368 --> 00:02:24,266
and it is enough for one of
these servers to be reachable

54
00:02:24,266 --> 00:02:26,812
to enable successful name lookup.

55
00:02:26,812 --> 00:02:28,908
This requires a bit of extra care,

56
00:02:28,908 --> 00:02:32,406
we need to periodically resynchronize
the different directory copies.

57
00:02:32,406 --> 00:02:34,205
That is because different servers

58
00:02:34,205 --> 00:02:35,666
see different updates,

59
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,594
so we need a periodic sweep

60
00:02:37,594 --> 00:02:39,887
in order to bring all
the different directory copies

61
00:02:39,887 --> 00:02:41,730
up to date.
