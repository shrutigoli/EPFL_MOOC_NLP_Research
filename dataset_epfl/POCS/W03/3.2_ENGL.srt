1
00:00:04,463 --> 00:00:06,873
We will now look at the basic 
name-mapping algorithms

2
00:00:06,873 --> 00:00:08,523
used by computer systems.

3
00:00:08,523 --> 00:00:11,243
First, we have Table lookup.

4
00:00:12,193 --> 00:00:16,193
So, we have looked at three 
basic name-mapping algorithms:

5
00:00:16,487 --> 00:00:20,487
"Table lookup, Recursive lookup,
and Multiple lookup."

6
00:00:20,546 --> 00:00:22,276
These three algorithms differ

7
00:00:22,276 --> 00:00:24,536
in the number
of contexts that they consider,

8
00:00:24,536 --> 00:00:27,136
and in the way in which they
consider these contexts.

9
00:00:27,136 --> 00:00:30,196
Table lookup maps
a name to a value,

10
00:00:30,196 --> 00:00:32,136
using a single context.

11
00:00:32,136 --> 00:00:35,486
Recursive lookup maps a
sequence of names to values

12
00:00:35,486 --> 00:00:38,216
using a different context at each step.

13
00:00:38,216 --> 00:00:41,596
Multiple lookup maps a name to a value

14
00:00:41,596 --> 00:00:45,346
after searching in
many different contexts.
