1
00:00:05,145 --> 00:00:06,295
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,686 --> 00:00:11,424
In this session, I will summarize
the main strategic issues

3
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:14,491
that City Managers
have to address.

4
00:00:16,048 --> 00:00:18,661
And these strategic issues
we distinguish them

5
00:00:18,872 --> 00:00:21,034
along the three main layers:

6
00:00:21,338 --> 00:00:25,776
Infrastructure, Services,
and Data or Digital Layer.

7
00:00:27,221 --> 00:00:29,858
Now, let us start with
the Digital Layer,

8
00:00:30,089 --> 00:00:33,951
with the Data Layer, because 
his is the real novelty in Smart City

9
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:37,579
and probably the most important
layer to pay attention to.

10
00:00:38,906 --> 00:00:42,119
We distinguish 5 areas,

11
00:00:42,352 --> 00:00:45,615
in which you have
to make strategic decisions.

12
00:00:46,119 --> 00:00:49,044
We just put here the main
things to consider.

13
00:00:50,114 --> 00:00:52,277
So, on the Data Layer,

14
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:56,639
let's look at the technological
strategic decisions

15
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:59,925
and here the main question is
really about standards.

16
00:01:00,382 --> 00:01:04,107
Which standards for the
Telecom Infrastructure?

17
00:01:04,390 --> 00:01:07,090
which standards for the devices?

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,425
So that everything is optimal
interconnected.

19
00:01:11,164 --> 00:01:12,789
On the financial side,

20
00:01:13,066 --> 00:01:15,841
this is the question of
the pricing of the data.

21
00:01:16,088 --> 00:01:19,313
How much are you prepared to pay
for the data?

22
00:01:19,548 --> 00:01:21,973
Are they open data?
Are they free?

23
00:01:22,252 --> 00:01:25,002
Who pays for the data,
ultimately?

24
00:01:26,249 --> 00:01:30,111
On the political side,
it's a question of regulation.

25
00:01:30,757 --> 00:01:33,094
Of course, managers do not
regulate

26
00:01:33,301 --> 00:01:37,326
but, managers will behave
differently depending on

27
00:01:37,562 --> 00:01:41,774
whether the data layer is
regulated as an infrastructure

28
00:01:42,043 --> 00:01:43,993
with basic questions of access?


29
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:49,479
Or whether it is regulated as services
that are competing against each other.

30
00:01:51,265 --> 00:01:53,777
On the social dimension,

31
00:01:54,503 --> 00:01:58,816
the typical questions, the typical
strategic decision

32
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:02,565
that have to be made
are about data ownership.

33
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:05,824
Are these data owned by the
citizens themselves?

34
00:02:06,102 --> 00:02:09,815
Are they owned by the city?
Are they owned by the operators?

35
00:02:12,251 --> 00:02:16,514
Are they owned by the carriers?
The Telecom operators?

36
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:21,608
So, here these kinds of strategic
decisions need to be made

37
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:25,789
and of course, also decisions
about levels of privacy

38
00:02:26,091 --> 00:02:27,554
that need to be granted.

39
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:30,138
And on the environmental side,

40
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:33,608
there are all kinds of
considerations, strategic decisions

41
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:37,226
about the life cycle
of digitalization.

42
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:41,641
We all know that many
of these digital devices

43
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:46,451
also have environmental impact
and we have to consider and

44
00:02:46,718 --> 00:02:51,093
strategically decide about
these digital devices.

45
00:02:52,528 --> 00:02:55,391
Now, let's look at
the Services Layer, okay?

46
00:02:55,834 --> 00:03:00,709
Now, we have already mentioned
before that the main challenge here

47
00:03:00,986 --> 00:03:04,636
on the technological side is
really services integration.

48
00:03:05,392 --> 00:03:11,017
It's about making it possible that
services can be linked to each other,

49
00:03:11,257 --> 00:03:15,920
that they can be bundled, and
they can be offered as a bundle.

50
00:03:16,607 --> 00:03:18,220
On the financial side,

51
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:22,575
it's the whole strategic decision
about competition and cooperation.

52
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:27,629
Competition and cooperation
amongst the services providers

53
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:31,772
but also competition cooperation
amongst services themselves.

54
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:34,701
On the political side,

55
00:03:35,429 --> 00:03:39,304
It's the whole question of
the type of services

56
00:03:39,598 --> 00:03:41,386
that you want to develop.

57
00:03:43,323 --> 00:03:45,960
Services rather for the citizens,

58
00:03:46,188 --> 00:03:48,350
rather commercial services,

59
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,435
rather transport,
rather in other areas.

60
00:03:51,673 --> 00:03:54,473
So those are
strategic decision to make

61
00:03:54,978 --> 00:03:56,641
On the social side,

62
00:03:57,132 --> 00:04:00,757
It's the whole question of
Digital Divide.

63
00:04:01,286 --> 00:04:04,498
How inclusive do you want to be?

64
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:09,986
What kind of solutions
do you offer to citizens

65
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:15,113
who are not capable to fully
participate in the digital world.

66
00:04:15,897 --> 00:04:20,372
As we have already seen, also,
was the question of liability.

67
00:04:20,894 --> 00:04:24,932
If something goes wrong,
if some of these services

68
00:04:25,901 --> 00:04:29,464
are not satisfactorily provided.

69
00:04:29,794 --> 00:04:31,819
Who is ultimately liable?

70
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,591
The service provider?
The infrastructure provider?

71
00:04:34,863 --> 00:04:36,813
The Telecom operator?
Who ever.

72
00:04:37,338 --> 00:04:39,438
And on the environmental side,

73
00:04:39,729 --> 00:04:43,454
I think the fundamental
strategic decision is

74
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:48,692
whether you want these services
to really respond

75
00:04:48,993 --> 00:04:52,455
to the changing citizen behaviour,
consumer behaviour

76
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:55,495
or, whether you want these
services

77
00:04:55,734 --> 00:05:01,797
to ultimately optimize the existing
urban infrastructure systems.

78
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:04,467


79
00:05:03,556 --> 00:05:06,331
Now, on the infrastructure
themselves

80
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:09,559
I think technologically
the first question to...

81
00:05:09,966 --> 00:05:12,654
the first strategic decision
to make is,

82
00:05:12,961 --> 00:05:17,011
how to integrate new
infrastructures?

83
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:20,972
New buses, new smart meters

84
00:05:21,536 --> 00:05:23,561
into the legacy infrastructures?

85
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:26,907
How do you integrate
these kinds of things?

86
00:05:27,182 --> 00:05:28,570
On the financial side,

87
00:05:28,824 --> 00:05:33,361
it's of course the question of who
pays for the digital infrastructure?

88
00:05:33,576 --> 00:05:35,514
Who pays for the smart meters?

89
00:05:35,748 --> 00:05:38,098
Who pays for all kinds of devices

90
00:05:38,344 --> 00:05:41,744
and even the Telecom infrastructure
that is necessary?

91
00:05:42,281 --> 00:05:43,819
On the political side,

92
00:05:44,702 --> 00:05:49,577
one has to be aware of the
longterm impact of  these decisions.

93
00:05:49,821 --> 00:05:52,346
We are talking about infrastructure,

94
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:55,805
so, whatever technology
is being bought or

95
00:05:56,031 --> 00:05:59,356
implemented will be there
for quite a long time.

96
00:05:59,565 --> 00:06:03,152
so it is important to make the right
strategic decision.

97
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:05,155
On the social side, 

98
00:06:05,423 --> 00:06:08,811
there are of course, all kinds of
externalities

99
00:06:09,026 --> 00:06:11,563
 with urban infrastructures.

100
00:06:12,523 --> 00:06:15,448
Some parts of the city,
some citizens

101
00:06:15,702 --> 00:06:18,790
may bare the cost
of these externalities

102
00:06:19,309 --> 00:06:21,971
while other ones may take profits.

103
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:25,464
And these are considerations
managers have to make,

104
00:06:26,106 --> 00:06:28,368
and finally,
on the environmental side,

105
00:06:28,594 --> 00:06:31,682
there are of course, also
life cycle considerations

106
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:34,823
of the infrastructures themselves.

107
00:06:35,824 --> 00:06:38,549
So, in this session we have now
talked about

108
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:42,409
the strategic decisions that
managers may need to make.

109
00:06:43,002 --> 00:06:46,140
In the next session, we will
talk about the decisions

110
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,360
that policy makers need to make.

111
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:49,935
So stay tuned.
