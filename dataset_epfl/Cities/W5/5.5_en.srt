1
00:00:05,624 --> 00:00:07,817
Welcome back.

2
00:00:08,017 --> 00:00:08,967
In this session,

3
00:00:09,167 --> 00:00:09,998
we will now talk 

4
00:00:10,198 --> 00:00:12,222
about the strategic decisions

5
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:15,026
that policy-makers will have to make

6
00:00:15,226 --> 00:00:18,209
in order to move 
towards a smart city.

7
00:00:18,409 --> 00:00:19,702
And we will use

8
00:00:19,902 --> 00:00:23,615
the same distinction
along the three different layers.

9
00:00:23,715 --> 00:00:25,094
Namely, the infrastructure,

10
00:00:25,294 --> 00:00:26,301
the services,

11
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:28,585
and the digital or data layer.

12
00:00:28,785 --> 00:00:29,527
At the end,

13
00:00:29,727 --> 00:00:34,253
we will briefly conclude
the entire MOOC.

14
00:00:36,124 --> 00:00:37,868
Now, in this matrix,

15
00:00:38,068 --> 00:00:39,992
you see the three different layers.

16
00:00:40,192 --> 00:00:42,681
You will also see 
the five different dimensions.

17
00:00:42,881 --> 00:00:45,881
So first, let's move along
the digital layer.

18
00:00:47,344 --> 00:00:49,780
The first considerations,

19
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:52,395
the technological considerations

20
00:00:52,595 --> 00:00:55,604
that policy-makers need to make,

21
00:00:55,767 --> 00:00:59,222
is to decide whether 
they want to rely

22
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:00,797
on their own companies,

23
00:01:00,997 --> 00:01:02,241
on local startups,

24
00:01:02,441 --> 00:01:04,959
or whether they want to use

25
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,090
the knowledge and the expertise

26
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,534
of global players.

27
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:11,693
Then on the financial side,

28
00:01:11,893 --> 00:01:15,252
they have to make a basic decision

29
00:01:15,452 --> 00:01:16,692
whether they want

30
00:01:16,892 --> 00:01:19,892
the digital and the data layer

31
00:01:20,092 --> 00:01:22,075
to be market driven

32
00:01:22,275 --> 00:01:24,051
or public policy driven.

33
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:25,556
Are the data a market

34
00:01:25,756 --> 00:01:28,499
by which they attract companies?

35
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:33,165
Or are they an object
of public policy

36
00:01:33,365 --> 00:01:34,969
that they try to implement?

37
00:01:36,009 --> 00:01:37,643
On the political side,

38
00:01:37,843 --> 00:01:40,843
the big decisions,
the strategic decisions,

39
00:01:41,043 --> 00:01:43,174
are about privacy 
as a matter of regulation. 

40
00:01:43,374 --> 00:01:44,880
How much privacy?

41
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:46,511
And of course, 

42
00:01:46,711 --> 00:01:49,344
it's always a question
about ownership.

43
00:01:49,544 --> 00:01:51,690
Who owns the data, ultimately,

44
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:53,155
is a political decision.

45
00:01:54,217 --> 00:01:56,829
On the social dimension,

46
00:01:57,029 --> 00:01:59,035
I think there is 
a big policy decision

47
00:01:59,235 --> 00:02:02,928
about digital literacy.

48
00:02:03,128 --> 00:02:07,606
Do the city politicians

49
00:02:07,806 --> 00:02:10,806
want to promote digital literacy

50
00:02:11,006 --> 00:02:14,292
and sort of have their citizens

51
00:02:14,492 --> 00:02:16,672
be the leaders in digital literacy?

52
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:18,335
Or do they simply want

53
00:02:18,535 --> 00:02:21,933
to have the citizens adapt

54
00:02:22,133 --> 00:02:24,988
to this kind of digital challenges.

55
00:02:25,188 --> 00:02:27,627
On the environmental side,

56
00:02:27,827 --> 00:02:31,900
of course there are a lot of broader
environmental considerations

57
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:33,781
about digitalization.

58
00:02:34,749 --> 00:02:38,348
How much environmental impact

59
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:41,252
does digitalization ultimately have?

60
00:02:41,452 --> 00:02:43,719
And how much environmental good

61
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,158
does digitalization
ultimately bring?

62
00:02:47,145 --> 00:02:48,912
On the services layer,

63
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:53,673
I think the politicians 
and policy-makers

64
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,563
have to make a decision

65
00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:57,935
as to whether the city 

66
00:02:58,135 --> 00:03:01,135
is simply a user of a platform

67
00:03:01,335 --> 00:03:04,008
that they have bought
from somewhere.

68
00:03:04,208 --> 00:03:07,208
Or whether the city

69
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:09,855
is on its own a platform owner

70
00:03:10,055 --> 00:03:11,821
and a platform provider

71
00:03:12,021 --> 00:03:13,773
for other users.

72
00:03:13,973 --> 00:03:16,030
On the financial side,

73
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:18,365
the question is whether

74
00:03:18,565 --> 00:03:21,565
they want to enable
the development of services,

75
00:03:21,765 --> 00:03:25,395
encourage the development
of services by others,

76
00:03:25,595 --> 00:03:29,286
or whether they want to develop
the services themselves. 

77
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:31,938
On the political side,

78
00:03:32,138 --> 00:03:35,581
this is the question 
of the governance of the services.

79
00:03:35,781 --> 00:03:37,954
We have already seen

80
00:03:38,004 --> 00:03:39,284
through sharing economy,

81
00:03:39,317 --> 00:03:40,499
there are new companies

82
00:03:40,537 --> 00:03:43,556
where the citizens get involved
 in the services themselves.

83
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:46,527
And this raises
totally new questions

84
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,065
for policy makers

85
00:03:48,265 --> 00:03:50,079
as to how to govern

86
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:53,990
the new smart services 
that are provided in a city.

87
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:55,925
And on the social side,

88
00:03:56,125 --> 00:03:58,187
we have already seen previously,

89
00:03:58,387 --> 00:04:00,809
that the big strategic decisions

90
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:04,005
are about the universal 
services' obligations.

91
00:04:04,205 --> 00:04:05,125
That is,

92
00:04:05,325 --> 00:04:07,407
what kind of services,

93
00:04:07,607 --> 00:04:10,607
what minimal services,

94
00:04:10,807 --> 00:04:15,817
that the citizens are ultimately 
entitled to in the digital age.

95
00:04:16,017 --> 00:04:19,590
And the on the environmental side,

96
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,424
it's more a strategic decision

97
00:04:22,624 --> 00:04:27,790
as to whether to let
the services evolve

98
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:30,003
by themselves, Laissez-fair,

99
00:04:30,203 --> 00:04:34,514
or whether the cities 
want to incentivize

100
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:36,974
the behavior of the citizens,

101
00:04:37,174 --> 00:04:40,494
so as they use
rather green services.

102
00:04:41,513 --> 00:04:43,874
On the infrastructure side,

103
00:04:44,074 --> 00:04:46,918
and as we have seen previously,

104
00:04:47,118 --> 00:04:50,318
the big strategic 
decision for policy-makers

105
00:04:50,518 --> 00:04:51,443
is of course, 

106
00:04:51,643 --> 00:04:54,481
whether to use
the existing network,

107
00:04:54,681 --> 00:04:57,433
or whether to develop or to buy

108
00:04:57,633 --> 00:05:00,103
 a dedicated network 
for the smart city.

109
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:02,242
On the financial side,

110
00:05:02,442 --> 00:05:04,309
we have previously discussed,

111
00:05:04,509 --> 00:05:06,299
and we summarize here again.

112
00:05:06,499 --> 00:05:09,499
It's the whole question 
of sustainable financing 

113
00:05:09,699 --> 00:05:12,507
in a context where the value added

114
00:05:12,707 --> 00:05:15,440
 is actually moving 
to the digital layer.

115
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:19,104
So the question of how
to generate the money

116
00:05:19,304 --> 00:05:21,051
that is ultimately flowing back 

117
00:05:21,251 --> 00:05:23,168
into the urban infrastructures.

118
00:05:23,368 --> 00:05:25,052
On the political side,

119
00:05:26,016 --> 00:05:27,932
it's a little bit the  question

120
00:05:28,132 --> 00:05:31,730
of the development 
of infrastructures

121
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:34,012
for smart city.

122
00:05:34,212 --> 00:05:39,570
Or wether it's more about 
the promotion and marketing side

123
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:42,337
to promote the city as a smart city.

124
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:43,773
On the social side,

125
00:05:43,973 --> 00:05:46,973
the whole question is: 
"The smart city for whom?"

126
00:05:47,173 --> 00:05:51,748
Who is really 
the goal of the smart city?

127
00:05:51,948 --> 00:05:52,745
The citizens?

128
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,996
The inhabitants of the city?

129
00:05:55,196 --> 00:05:58,196
Or is it ultimately about
the competitiveness 

130
00:05:58,396 --> 00:05:59,166
of a city,

131
00:05:59,366 --> 00:06:03,971
in an increasingly competitive
global economic environment.

132
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:06,586
And on the environmental side,

133
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:11,162
the question that policy-makers 
have to ask themselves,

134
00:06:11,362 --> 00:06:17,845
How central is the environmental 
issues ultimately for them?

135
00:06:17,932 --> 00:06:19,061
And that will decide 

136
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:21,910
what type of infrastructure
they will put in. 

137
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:24,582
Now there are two more things

138
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:27,403
I want to say before
we conclude this MOOC.

139
00:06:27,603 --> 00:06:29,968
We have always insisted

140
00:06:30,168 --> 00:06:31,168
that we talk about

141
00:06:31,368 --> 00:06:33,688
urban systems,

142
00:06:33,888 --> 00:06:37,705
about socio-technical systems.

143
00:06:37,905 --> 00:06:40,001
Now for pedagogical reasons

144
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:43,201
we have treated transportations,

145
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:45,977
smart urban transportation systems,

146
00:06:46,177 --> 00:06:49,369
and smart urban 
energy systems separately.

147
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:51,043
But we should not forget

148
00:06:51,243 --> 00:06:52,664
that ultimately

149
00:06:52,864 --> 00:06:54,581
we are talking about

150
00:06:54,781 --> 00:06:57,365
a system of systems.

151
00:06:57,565 --> 00:06:59,960
With subsystems being:

152
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,507
the water system, the sewage system,

153
00:07:02,707 --> 00:07:03,957
the housing system,

154
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,566
the green infrastructure systems,

155
00:07:06,766 --> 00:07:09,766
all of them 
being connected to each other.

156
00:07:09,966 --> 00:07:12,102
And thanks to the digitalization,

157
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:15,302
becoming even more integrated.

158
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:20,985
And services also becoming even more
integrated as a result of that.

159
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:22,804
So first we mark 

160
00:07:23,004 --> 00:07:27,074
the systemic nature of 
urban infrastructure systems.

161
00:07:29,005 --> 00:07:31,113
The second thing 
I want to talk about

162
00:07:31,313 --> 00:07:32,858
when looking into the future,

163
00:07:33,058 --> 00:07:35,674
is technological developments.

164
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:39,215
Now we have very much 
insisted in this MOOC

165
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:41,816
on the digital technologies.

166
00:07:42,016 --> 00:07:45,941
And the progress made 
in the digital technologies

167
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:50,985
as a game changer 
for urban infrastructure systems.

168
00:07:51,185 --> 00:07:54,485
But, 
there isn't just digitalization,

169
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:58,675
there are a lot of other 
technological developments

170
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:02,412
that affect the various
urban infrastructures.

171
00:08:02,612 --> 00:08:04,039
So let's look at some of them.

172
00:08:04,239 --> 00:08:06,189
In the transportation sector,

173
00:08:06,389 --> 00:08:10,783
we see substantial 
technological progress

174
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:13,769
towards self-driving vehicles

175
00:08:13,969 --> 00:08:16,600
and that will be another step

176
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:19,800
in the changing 
urban mobility systems.

177
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,746
We also see a lot of substantial
technological changes,

178
00:08:23,946 --> 00:08:26,342
in terms of storage, batteries,

179
00:08:26,542 --> 00:08:29,174
which will ultimately make a link

180
00:08:29,374 --> 00:08:33,081
between vehicles
and urban energy systems.

181
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:36,033
We see a lot 
of technological developments

182
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:38,089
in electricity generation,

183
00:08:38,289 --> 00:08:40,040
more and more decentralized,

184
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,718
more and more efficient generation.

185
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:45,202
Other technological developments,

186
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:49,295
In terms of drinking water
and waste water treatment,

187
00:08:49,495 --> 00:08:52,495
which become much more efficient.

188
00:08:52,695 --> 00:08:55,080
In terms of recycling,

189
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:59,328
we see technologies 
for waste treatment,

190
00:08:59,528 --> 00:09:01,280
for waste handling,

191
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,153
making the urban resources 
much more circular.

192
00:09:08,353 --> 00:09:10,066
In terms of housing,

193
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:13,664
we see a lot of progress 
in terms of materials,

194
00:09:13,864 --> 00:09:16,377
making buildings more efficient,

195
00:09:16,452 --> 00:09:17,671
smarter,

196
00:09:17,871 --> 00:09:19,387
and resilient.

197
00:09:19,587 --> 00:09:21,892
And also in green infrastructures.

198
00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:24,360
There is a lot 
of technological development

199
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,622
in terms of genetic engineering,

200
00:09:26,822 --> 00:09:29,324
actually bringing 
the green infrastructure

201
00:09:29,524 --> 00:09:35,104
more and more into the entire
urban system and metabolism.

202
00:09:36,929 --> 00:09:37,863
To conclude,

203
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:41,063
in this MOOC, you have learned about

204
00:09:41,263 --> 00:09:44,482
what it takes to transit
toward a smart city.

205
00:09:45,545 --> 00:09:47,212
We have particularly focused

206
00:09:47,412 --> 00:09:49,075
on the three layers.

207
00:09:49,275 --> 00:09:51,987
All along, 
we have made this distinction,

208
00:09:52,187 --> 00:09:55,591
between the infrastructure layer,
the services layer,

209
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,503
and the new digital layer 
in between.

210
00:09:58,703 --> 00:10:02,736
Which is the novelty
of the smart city.

211
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,072
We have also shown you

212
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:07,122
how these layers 
are related to each other.

213
00:10:07,322 --> 00:10:10,120
And we have shown you two examples.

214
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,892
Namely, smart urban transportation,

215
00:10:13,092 --> 00:10:15,741
and smart urban energy systems.

216
00:10:16,643 --> 00:10:18,269
And we truly hope,

217
00:10:18,469 --> 00:10:20,387
that you have enjoyed this course.

218
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,675
Finally,

219
00:10:23,503 --> 00:10:25,219
do not forget

220
00:10:25,419 --> 00:10:27,892
to finish the mandatory assignments,

221
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:30,095
and if you are interested,

222
00:10:30,295 --> 00:10:32,385
to write the optional case.

223
00:10:32,585 --> 00:10:34,974
And then, please stay connected.
