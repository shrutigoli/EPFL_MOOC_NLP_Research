1
00:00:05,375 --> 00:00:06,746
Welcome back.

2
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:13,535
I am sure you are aware that, currently,
no Smarty City is fully functioning.

3
00:00:13,735 --> 00:00:16,683
We are moving toward Smart City,

4
00:00:16,883 --> 00:00:20,846
and Smart City is actually, rather, a process
than a final state.

5
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:24,281
Therefore, it may be a little bit premature

6
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:30,924
to talk about all the challenges
that we see in Smart City services.

7
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:38,650
What we currently see is that
Smart City services

8
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,456
will raise, we think, 3 main big challenges:

9
00:00:43,656 --> 00:00:46,403
the challenge of services integration,

10
00:00:46,603 --> 00:00:50,432
the challenge of universal
service obligation,

11
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:52,985
and the challenge of quality.

12
00:00:53,185 --> 00:00:59,533
Let's briefly come back to the conceptualization
of this entire MOOC.

13
00:00:59,733 --> 00:01:03,762
Namely, the idea that you have
infrastructure services

14
00:01:03,962 --> 00:01:06,535
that has already been infrastructures

15
00:01:06,735 --> 00:01:11,967
and, traditionally, the services are delivered
on the basis of the infrastructures.

16
00:01:12,167 --> 00:01:17,568
Now, on top of that we have a digital layer
in between

17
00:01:17,768 --> 00:01:22,202
that, as we have said, changes
the  nature of the services,

18
00:01:22,402 --> 00:01:26,409
and changes, actually, the relationship
with the customers.

19
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:33,166
From there, we can picture the 3 types
of challenges that are raised.

20
00:01:33,366 --> 00:01:37,846
The challenge of services integration
across the layers

21
00:01:38,046 --> 00:01:43,085
or between the infrastructure and the layer.

22
00:01:43,285 --> 00:01:47,616
The challenge of universal service obligation,
and the challenge of quality.

23
00:01:47,816 --> 00:01:53,116
So let's first talk about services integration.

24
00:01:53,316 --> 00:02:00,039
Traditionally, you have traditional infrastructure

25
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:02,949
services providers in any city.

26
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:04,647
The water company.

27
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:06,028
The electricity company.

28
00:02:06,228 --> 00:02:08,722
The different transport companies.

29
00:02:08,922 --> 00:02:11,331
The waste management company.

30
00:02:11,531 --> 00:02:14,978
They generally own the infrastructure

31
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:18,751
and are now, thanks to digitalization,

32
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:22,679
capable of developing their services,

33
00:02:24,493 --> 00:02:30,175
new services, on the bases of their
traditional services.

34
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:39,283
These are the kind of actors that
are taking advantage of digitalization

35
00:02:39,483 --> 00:02:46,250
to improve, to further advance,
their infrastructure services,

36
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:48,707
but there are also new providers,

37
00:02:50,747 --> 00:02:56,354
like, let's say, a mobility service provider
who does not own any infrastructure,

38
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:58,325
who can enter into the market

39
00:02:58,525 --> 00:03:04,713
thanks to this new digitalization
and the data that are generated here.

40
00:03:04,913 --> 00:03:08,880
We have already seen, before, that,
in this case,

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:14,429
the new kind of services, the customers
become much more active.

42
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,310
They can become prosumers.

43
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,637
They can interact.

44
00:03:17,837 --> 00:03:22,475
They can even, themselves,
organize the services:

45
00:03:22,675 --> 00:03:25,482
bike sharing services,
sharing economy.

46
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:26,830
Things like that.

47
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:33,476
From here follow the 3 main challenges
of services integration.

48
00:03:33,676 --> 00:03:37,636
The 1st challenge,
actually a traditional one,

49
00:03:37,836 --> 00:03:41,388
but exacerbated because of digitalization,

50
00:03:41,588 --> 00:03:47,187
is the challenge of services coordination
across the different services.

51
00:03:47,387 --> 00:03:53,705
So, the traditional operators,
urban infrastructure operators,

52
00:03:53,905 --> 00:03:55,638
have their different services.

53
00:03:55,838 --> 00:03:58,565
Vis-a-vis the customers, now,

54
00:03:58,765 --> 00:04:03,832
these services are being integrated
or connected.

55
00:04:04,032 --> 00:04:08,151
You can offer, let's say,
to citizens,

56
00:04:08,351 --> 00:04:12,005
customers who own electric vehicles,

57
00:04:12,205 --> 00:04:17,301
you can offer combined mobility
and energy services.

58
00:04:17,501 --> 00:04:21,640
Of course, these kind of services
have to be integrated

59
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,380
physically, and electronically
as well.

60
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,107
So this is the 1st challenge.

61
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:33,921
The 2nd challenge is the one
of data integration.

62
00:04:34,121 --> 00:04:40,388
This, of course, affects, in particular,
the new services providers

63
00:04:40,588 --> 00:04:46,083
because they can only provide the services
on the basis

64
00:04:46,283 --> 00:04:50,215
of this digital layer, on the basis
of the data

65
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:53,627
that are generated inside the city,

66
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:58,886
typically by the traditional
infrastructure services providers,

67
00:04:59,086 --> 00:05:01,839
but sometimes, also, by other actors.

68
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:07,323
The challenge here is to make sure
these data are integrated

69
00:05:07,523 --> 00:05:12,079
so that the new services are possible.

70
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:17,385
The 3rd challenge, of course, is, then,
to somehow integrate,

71
00:05:17,585 --> 00:05:21,784
coordinate, old and new services.

72
00:05:24,878 --> 00:05:28,155
Coordinate purely digital services

73
00:05:28,355 --> 00:05:31,122
with traditional infrastructure services

74
00:05:31,322 --> 00:05:35,156
These kind of things need
to all be addressed

75
00:05:35,356 --> 00:05:39,184
at the services coordination level

76
00:05:39,384 --> 00:05:44,563
if we want to have good quality
smart urban services.

77
00:05:46,894 --> 00:05:49,909
Let's go to the 2nd big challenge.

78
00:05:50,109 --> 00:05:56,037
The 2nd big challenge is this challenge
of universal services obligation.

79
00:05:56,237 --> 00:06:01,574
This is a traditional concept that comes
from the traditional infrastructures.

80
00:06:03,427 --> 00:06:05,627
It basically means

81
00:06:05,827 --> 00:06:08,047
that the citizens

82
00:06:09,979 --> 00:06:13,656
should be entitled to some basic services

83
00:06:13,856 --> 00:06:19,595
in terms of quality, accessibility,
and affordability.

84
00:06:19,795 --> 00:06:24,232
This is mainly geared at the weakest
customers,

85
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:25,877
at the weakest citizens,

86
00:06:26,077 --> 00:06:28,016
who may not be able to afford

87
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:31,151
or may not have access to these services.

88
00:06:31,351 --> 00:06:33,262
So there are 2 issues here.

89
00:06:33,462 --> 00:06:36,923
The 1st issue is the issue of accessibility.

90
00:06:37,123 --> 00:06:42,608
Think, for example, of information
about public transport.

91
00:06:42,808 --> 00:06:49,320
The new generation gets this information
all on their app on their smart phone,

92
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,104
but there are older generations who are not

93
00:06:53,463 --> 00:06:58,516
equally versed in these kind of technologies

94
00:06:58,716 --> 00:07:03,980
and may not actually have access to certain
of the new services

95
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:06,603
on the digital layer, in the digital era.

96
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:12,673
This will be an issue of what
is typically called the digital divide

97
00:07:12,873 --> 00:07:16,580
in the sense that something
needs to be done

98
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:21,645
to either continue to make access possible

99
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:27,135
without digitalization for some
types of population,

100
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:30,152
or to train, to educate, people

101
00:07:30,352 --> 00:07:36,303
in order to also be able to access
these digital services.

102
00:07:36,503 --> 00:07:41,182
The 2nd issue is an issue
of affordability.

103
00:07:41,382 --> 00:07:44,556
This is a traditional issue.

104
00:07:44,756 --> 00:07:49,049
Some of the urban infrastructure services

105
00:07:49,249 --> 00:07:53,077
are essential, like water, like energy,

106
00:07:53,277 --> 00:07:56,584
like some sort of public transportation.

107
00:07:57,745 --> 00:08:03,860
These services may not be affordable
for some of the citizens,

108
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,992
and digitalization does not change anything.

109
00:08:07,192 --> 00:08:10,039
It is not because of digitalization
they will be more affordable,

110
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,118
even though we have seen there may
be some efficiency gains.

111
00:08:13,318 --> 00:08:16,222
The issue here is triple, actually.

112
00:08:16,422 --> 00:08:18,375
There is an issue of equity.

113
00:08:18,575 --> 00:08:23,377
Do all the people have equal access
to these services?

114
00:08:23,577 --> 00:08:27,740
There is an issue of social tariffs.

115
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:33,765
In case some groups of citizens cannot
afford the services,

116
00:08:33,965 --> 00:08:36,276
should we have different tariffs?

117
00:08:36,476 --> 00:08:39,229
It may be lower water tariffs

118
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:44,070
for some people for whom water
is not affordable.

119
00:08:44,270 --> 00:08:47,089
Or also questions of subsidies.

120
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:51,355
Should some households be subsidized
for some of the services?

121
00:08:51,555 --> 00:08:58,188
Also, in the digital era, this question
of affordability will continue to exist.

122
00:08:58,388 --> 00:09:04,128
The 3rd big challenge is the challenge
of quality of services.

123
00:09:04,328 --> 00:09:09,595
We have already said that
in the digital era,

124
00:09:09,795 --> 00:09:13,367
the customers are somehow empowered.

125
00:09:13,567 --> 00:09:18,807
They may create, commence, communities,

126
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:20,440
shared economy.

127
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,400
They may offer services themselves.

128
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,615
They interact much more
with the services providers.

129
00:09:29,817 --> 00:09:31,996
The remains issues of competition.

130
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:36,566
Remember when I talked about this tendency

131
00:09:36,766 --> 00:09:39,480
on the digital layer towards concentration,

132
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,478
towards winner-takes-all.

133
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:47,155
That has a tendency to lead
to monopolies.

134
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:52,260
That may actually hamper the quality
of the service.

135
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:57,940
Typically, traditionally, we think that
the quality of a service is guaranteed

136
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:02,207
thanks to competition, but competition
may not always work

137
00:10:02,407 --> 00:10:04,699
or may not work perfectly.

138
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:09,579
It will not necessarily work better
in the digital era

139
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:13,037
than in the traditional, before.

140
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,009
There remain regulatory issues

141
00:10:16,209 --> 00:10:21,018
to make sure that also in the digital era
competition works.

142
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:25,262
The 2nd big issue is a legal issue.

143
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:27,579
It is an issue of liability.

144
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:32,413
There has always been questions
of liability if the bus does not come.

145
00:10:33,431 --> 00:10:39,415
If the train is late, we now have rules
about liability to the customers.

146
00:10:39,615 --> 00:10:42,503
If you get bumped from an airplane,
for example,

147
00:10:42,703 --> 00:10:46,187
but the problem of liability is,
of course,

148
00:10:46,387 --> 00:10:51,277
exacerbated because of the digital nature
of services.

149
00:10:52,784 --> 00:10:57,572
Some of the providers may not be,
themselves,

150
00:10:57,772 --> 00:11:02,043
actually, will not be, themselves,
the providers of the services.

151
00:11:02,243 --> 00:11:05,017
They just have the app by which you
buy the services.

152
00:11:05,217 --> 00:11:09,057
So the question will be,
who is ultimately liable?

153
00:11:09,257 --> 00:11:11,539
Is it the infrastructure provider?

154
00:11:11,739 --> 00:11:13,604
Is it the app owner?

155
00:11:15,705 --> 00:11:22,065
Is it the other citizens in the case
of some sort of shared services?

156
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:27,036
So there will be big liability issues
that we will have to clarify

157
00:11:27,236 --> 00:11:29,551
at the services layer.

158
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,426
I have now presented to you the main
3 challenges that arise

159
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:37,429
