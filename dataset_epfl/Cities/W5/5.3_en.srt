1
00:00:05,506 --> 00:00:08,792
In the previous session 
we talked about the services,

2
00:00:09,004 --> 00:00:12,224
the smart city services,
and the challenges 

3
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:14,805
posed by these services.

4
00:00:15,149 --> 00:00:18,884
In this session, we'll talk about 
the challenges posed 

5
00:00:19,084 --> 00:00:22,602
to the urban infrastructures
by the smart cities.

6
00:00:22,802 --> 00:00:25,880
And we identify 
three such challenges. 

7
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:30,539
First, it's the challenge of standards,
setting the standards. 

8
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:35,433
Then it's the challenge of setting
the right political priority.

9
00:00:35,633 --> 00:00:40,135
And thirdly, it's the challenge
of financing, 

10
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:42,972
financing the infrastructures. 

11
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:46,853
So let's first talk 
about the standards. 

12
00:00:47,392 --> 00:00:52,818
Now, the standards here 
we have already seen.

13
00:00:53,125 --> 00:01:01,474
In the first week we have seen 
the question of telecom infrastructures.

14
00:01:02,853 --> 00:01:09,323
The first challenge here is which 
kind of network to use. 

15
00:01:09,523 --> 00:01:14,176
Are we using 
an existing telecom network?

16
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:21,815
Usually, it's a historical provider,
or is the city developing 

17
00:01:22,015 --> 00:01:28,181
a dedicated smart city 
telecommunications network?

18
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:32,486
And the question of course is 
if we are using a new network,

19
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,550
who is going to pay for it?

20
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:41,072
Then, the second challenge is 
the interconnection. 

21
00:01:41,272 --> 00:01:45,856
We have also seen in the first week
that all the devices, 

22
00:01:46,082 --> 00:01:49,571
all these smart devices 
need to be connected

23
00:01:49,771 --> 00:01:56,109
to each other via the networks,
via the telecommunication networks. 

24
00:01:56,309 --> 00:01:59,713
And so, the big challenge here
is really the challenge

25
00:01:59,913 --> 00:02:02,989
of which standards 
are we going to use?

26
00:02:03,189 --> 00:02:07,144
Are we going to have 
one single standard,

27
00:02:07,344 --> 00:02:10,116
or if we cannot have 
one single standard,

28
00:02:10,316 --> 00:02:13,304
then how good is it 
for the smart city? 

29
00:02:13,504 --> 00:02:18,030
So who is defining these standards, 
is it the telecom operator?

30
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:20,339
The existing one or the new one?

31
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:25,453
In case the city develops a
dedicated network, 

32
00:02:25,653 --> 00:02:30,528
is it the infrastructure provider,
that is the utilities?

33
00:02:30,728 --> 00:02:36,767
Let's say the energy companies
or the water companies that may have

34
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:40,844
already their own telecommunications 
fiber network in there,

35
00:02:41,052 --> 00:02:45,353
and they are basically 
setting the standards for everybody else?

36
00:02:45,553 --> 00:02:51,698
Is it the industry, the different 
industries that are involved?

37
00:02:51,898 --> 00:02:54,987
Let's say 
the transportation industry itself 

38
00:02:55,187 --> 00:02:58,481
is setting the standards 
among themselves. 

39
00:02:58,688 --> 00:03:03,111
But which industry, is actually 
energy industry, transportation industry

40
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:05,291
that would be the two biggest ones. 

41
00:03:05,491 --> 00:03:08,642
Or is the city 
setting the standards? 

42
00:03:09,107 --> 00:03:12,638
But, here also, the question is 
you know, which city 

43
00:03:12,838 --> 00:03:16,653
as we have already said several times,
we are generally talking about 

44
00:03:16,853 --> 00:03:20,451
metropolitan areas that involve
several cities.

45
00:03:20,651 --> 00:03:25,522
So setting standards by cities 
also requires

46
00:03:25,722 --> 00:03:29,159
coordination among cities
to set the standards.

47
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:34,207
I think currently these kinds 
of questions are not yet answered

48
00:03:34,407 --> 00:03:36,858
but need to be addressed.

49
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:43,683
The second challenge that smart cities 
pose to urban infrastructures

50
00:03:43,883 --> 00:03:48,082
is the challenge of setting
the right political priorities.

51
00:03:48,295 --> 00:03:51,450
And we see three such challenges.

52
00:03:51,675 --> 00:03:56,513
First, I think the city needs
to get clear whether it wants

53
00:03:56,746 --> 00:04:00,821
to be about infrastructure
development

54
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:04,942
and putting in the infrastructures, 
or whether 

55
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:09,449
it basically wants 
to promote itself as a smart city,

56
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:15,433
more on the marketing kind of side. 
Each of them has risks. 

57
00:04:15,681 --> 00:04:21,039
You can develop the infrastructure,
and the smart city doesn't really follow.

58
00:04:21,233 --> 00:04:24,934
Or you can just promote the smart city,
but then you don't really have

59
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:30,575
the infrastructure in order to follow 
upon the marketing that you made. 

60
00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:34,244
The second big question
or challenge 

61
00:04:35,318 --> 00:04:40,298
in terms of political priorities is 
whether you focus 

62
00:04:40,498 --> 00:04:44,805
rather on infrastructures, 
infrastructure development 

63
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,634
including telecommunications
infrastructures?

64
00:04:49,009 --> 00:04:54,997
Or whether, as a city, you focus on
smart city services?

65
00:04:55,184 --> 00:04:59,349
So, setting up the infrastructures
and hoping first,

66
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:02,674
and hoping that 
the services will arise, 

67
00:05:02,882 --> 00:05:06,213
setting the right infrastructures,
the right standards

68
00:05:06,413 --> 00:05:10,997
and then automatically the smart 
city services will arise.

69
00:05:11,202 --> 00:05:17,350
Or as a city, you want to be
into smart services

70
00:05:17,556 --> 00:05:20,550
smart health services, smart 
transportation services,

71
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:24,999
smart kind of city services. 

72
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:29,200
That's I think the second big question,
political question 

73
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:31,168
that a city has to ask itself. 

74
00:05:31,368 --> 00:05:36,805
And the third big question is 
on which of the dimensions

75
00:05:37,005 --> 00:05:40,114
of a smart city to actually focus?

76
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:44,414
At least in terms of priority,
should we start with transports?

77
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:48,598
Smart transport with smart energy
with smart public services?

78
00:05:48,798 --> 00:05:52,310
Something else, smart buildings?

79
00:05:52,510 --> 00:05:56,969
But, you usually cannot do 
everything at the same time. 

80
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:01,101
So which are the most urgent 
problems where you reap

81
00:06:01,301 --> 00:06:03,897
the most rapid benefits,
and this I think

82
00:06:04,097 --> 00:06:07,202
is the second big challenge
for a city. 

83
00:06:07,402 --> 00:06:09,824
The challenge of setting 
the right priorities.

84
00:06:10,024 --> 00:06:14,273
The third big challenge that
smart cities pose

85
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:18,939
to urban infrastructures, is in 
terms of financing.

86
00:06:19,899 --> 00:06:23,441
In the first week of this MOOC,
I have already talked about

87
00:06:23,641 --> 00:06:28,719
the tendency that the value-added 
for the city, 

88
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,956
thanks to this digital layer,
is moving to the services layer.

89
00:06:34,156 --> 00:06:39,656
Potentially, the profits are rather
made at the services layer

90
00:06:39,856 --> 00:06:42,520
than at the infrastructure layer.

91
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,924
This, I think, is a general tendency
of digitalization.

92
00:06:47,799 --> 00:06:54,050
Now, what does that mean for smart cities 
and smart city infrastructures?

93
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:59,402
As a city you need to make sure
that the services,

94
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:04,397
the smart city services providers
are not just simply

95
00:07:04,597 --> 00:07:09,957
taking an advantage, cream-skimming
the urban infrastructure

96
00:07:10,157 --> 00:07:14,736
without putting any money
back into this infrastructure.

97
00:07:14,936 --> 00:07:19,805
They are profiting, let's say
a pier-to-pier taxi service

98
00:07:20,005 --> 00:07:25,041
will take advantage of 
the infrastructure, but does not

99
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:29,454
really put anything back into
that infrastructure.

100
00:07:29,629 --> 00:07:34,501
And so the challenge that arises here,
basically a regulatory challenge

101
00:07:34,678 --> 00:07:40,542
for a city is to make sure that some
of the profits that are made

102
00:07:40,738 --> 00:07:47,487
 at a services layer get reinvested
back into the infrastructure. 

103
00:07:47,687 --> 00:07:50,201
And this is not just for transport, 
this is for energy, 

104
00:07:50,401 --> 00:07:55,168
for water, and all the value-added
services 

105
00:07:55,368 --> 00:08:00,440
that are made at the digital
services layer. 

106
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:06,500
So reinvesting and regulating
reinvestment into the infrastructure,

107
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,866
I think, is the second big issue.

108
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:11,872
And the third big issue here is
of course, 

109
00:08:12,072 --> 00:08:16,261
the investment in 
the smart city itself. 

110
00:08:16,461 --> 00:08:19,408
So we have seen that 
the smart city needs networks.

111
00:08:19,608 --> 00:08:23,831
We have previously talked about
telecommunication networks.

112
00:08:24,031 --> 00:08:29,279
It needs devices, smart devices,
in order to be operational.

113
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:34,266
And typically, these kind of things 
have to be paid for,

114
00:08:34,466 --> 00:08:39,265
either by the city itself,
or by the private investors.

115
00:08:39,465 --> 00:08:44,356
But if you want to have 
private investors, the city needs to set 

116
00:08:44,519 --> 00:08:49,875
the conditions for this to be 
attractive to private investors.

117
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:55,356
That's another big challenge 
for financing urban infrastructures.

118
00:08:56,798 --> 00:09:00,834
To conclude, in the previous session
we have talked about

119
00:09:01,034 --> 00:09:05,216
the challenges that smart cities
pose to the services layer.

120
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:09,247
In this session, we have talked
about the three challenges

121
00:09:09,447 --> 00:09:13,302
to the infrastructure layers
of a smart city.

122
00:09:13,502 --> 00:09:17,641
Namely, standards, political priorities,
and financing.

123
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:22,470
Now in the next session we will
summarize all these challenges

124
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:27,118
across the three layers and see
what these challenges

125
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:29,678
mean for smart city managers.

126
00:09:29,917 --> 00:09:31,926
Stay tuned.
