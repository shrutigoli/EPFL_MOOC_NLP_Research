1
00:00:05,089 --> 00:00:06,852
Hello and welcome back
to the course.

2
00:00:07,033 --> 00:00:10,033
Today I have the pleasure of having
Norbert Ender

3
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:13,128
and Ulrich Schimpel
with me from IBM.

4
00:00:13,354 --> 00:00:16,692
Let's get to the first question.
Can you explain to us

5
00:00:16,933 --> 00:00:22,233
and our participants what are the key
strategies to use big data analytics

6
00:00:22,438 --> 00:00:25,463
for managing urban infrastructures
and how different are they

7
00:00:25,672 --> 00:00:29,285
from traditional approaches
in using data?

8
00:00:29,873 --> 00:00:33,023
Yes, thanks for having us.
Very good question.

9
00:00:33,537 --> 00:00:39,362
If we look back we usually think
in system of records which are

10
00:00:39,554 --> 00:00:47,304
data bases or ERP systems that
capture a certain process;

11
00:00:47,889 --> 00:00:53,802
something that we engineer
and use that data for analysis.

12
00:00:54,102 --> 00:00:58,852
Now we are moving more and more into
an area with IoT, mobile devices,

13
00:00:59,078 --> 00:01:05,090
everyone has a smartphone and with
this system of engagement

14
00:01:05,303 --> 00:01:12,215
becoming much more predominant,
we face a huge opportunity

15
00:01:12,561 --> 00:01:17,761
to really bring these 2 systems
together and really put the

16
00:01:17,979 --> 00:01:21,904
user into the center. To have a
user-centric system and 

17
00:01:22,107 --> 00:01:26,220
derive insights from this.
We call this System of Insights

18
00:01:26,456 --> 00:01:31,819
that accesses many different data
sources, bridges the silos;

19
00:01:32,024 --> 00:01:37,062
combines it with unstructured data
from the people and then come to

20
00:01:37,252 --> 00:01:41,564
new insights and analytics
that are really to the benefit

21
00:01:41,754 --> 00:01:45,517
of the citizens and of course
of the people running the city.

22
00:01:45,722 --> 00:01:50,660
Yeah Mohammed and a very good
example how this can

23
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,420
be beneficial for the city
and the citizen is the

24
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:58,520
Smart City project of Madrid.
Madrid turned their process;

25
00:01:58,743 --> 00:02:02,693
how they managed the city services
from an effort-based 

26
00:02:02,906 --> 00:02:07,319
to an SLR-based mode. They are
measuring the quality

27
00:02:07,528 --> 00:02:12,415
based on SLA. In order to do that
they established a city-wide

28
00:02:12,623 --> 00:02:19,323
data platform. That platform combines
the ERP data, the contract data

29
00:02:19,512 --> 00:02:25,912
with the IOT data from the cars,
from citizen feedback;

30
00:02:26,127 --> 00:02:30,039
so the citizen can
give feedback through an app.

31
00:02:30,244 --> 00:02:33,444
They combined this and the
evaluate the SLR

32
00:02:33,651 --> 00:02:37,264
and give directions to the service
people; how to improve

33
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:41,613
and how to operate the service.
The benefit is really huge.

34
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,819
They are saving approximately
1 million euro

35
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:49,209
with that approach a month so
really beneficial for the city

36
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:54,219
and also beneficial for the citizen.
They see now a better quality

37
00:02:54,409 --> 00:02:56,672
of the service
for even less money.

38
00:02:57,102 --> 00:02:59,040
Great. Thank you
very much for the answer.

39
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,932
Now let's get to
the second question.

40
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:04,740
What are the key strategies to
get insight from the city data?

41
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:08,781
It's going back to the structured
and unstructured data.

42
00:03:08,987 --> 00:03:15,937
Actually we also call the data
'dark data' because 80% of the

43
00:03:16,131 --> 00:03:21,681
data that we are producing with
sensors, videos and audio

44
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:28,208
and chats are actually not
available for analysis.

45
00:03:29,207 --> 00:03:32,182
Now the idea is really
with this new capabilities of

46
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:36,240
cognitive computing, machine
learning, artificial intelligence

47
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:40,420
we have advanced analytics; we have
NLP Natural Language Processing

48
00:03:40,877 --> 00:03:46,852
we have the possibility
to analyze this data and to

49
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:53,444
derive insights. That actually
brings completely new dimension

50
00:03:53,624 --> 00:03:59,749
of what we can do.
A very nice example of this

51
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,784
is really where you
think of parked cars.

52
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:08,833
They are parked at least
80% of the time in the city

53
00:04:09,075 --> 00:04:13,900
and they actually do have a lot of
battery. They have very good sensors

54
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:21,198
and if we can leverage
these new platforms as a service

55
00:04:21,403 --> 00:04:25,240
then you might be looking for a new
parking lot just because you have

56
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:31,268
some kind of radar in your car.
You might do some gas leak detection

57
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:36,317
or maybe even observe the traffic
flow with these new systems

58
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,563
and the analysis
of them.

59
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:47,955
As IBM we see as our aim to make
this easy for city's leaders

60
00:04:48,876 --> 00:04:51,988
and for that we've developed a
platform, a software platform.

61
00:04:52,183 --> 00:04:54,545
It's called Intelligent
Operations Center.

62
00:04:54,777 --> 00:04:57,990
That platform helps really
to bring this data together,

63
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:02,287
to analyze those data and
we have different use cases

64
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:07,527
so for traffic management, for water
management, for energy efficiency.

65
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:12,891
What is also important is
that platform runs on a cloud.

66
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:16,952
I think it's very important
also as a technology

67
00:05:17,175 --> 00:05:21,100
to put on cloud; to put data on
cloud; to make them available

68
00:05:21,285 --> 00:05:28,035
for different applications and
bring them forth to the clients.

69
00:05:28,892 --> 00:05:31,855
Of course there's also a
downside to the whole thing

70
00:05:32,053 --> 00:05:35,315
which is really the data
privacy and security.

71
00:05:36,763 --> 00:05:39,901
It's not only about the technology
which partially exists but

72
00:05:40,124 --> 00:05:43,574
it's also about the usability
and making people aware

73
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:48,763
about this sensitive topic.
Countries have different perceptions

74
00:05:48,966 --> 00:05:54,629
and legislation but I think one
very powerful approach is

75
00:05:54,895 --> 00:06:01,608
this approach of opting-in so it is
actually the responsibility of the

76
00:06:01,863 --> 00:06:05,951
people that are offering these
services to convince the users,

77
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:09,729
the citizens that the services
are of such high value 

78
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:12,931
that they are willing
to give data

79
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:18,187
for your benefit but of course
also for their own benefit.

80
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:21,940
Very interesting. Thank you.
Then as a third question, Norbert,

81
00:06:22,153 --> 00:06:26,253
can you explain to us a little bit
what would be a roadmap towards

82
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:29,675
utilizing big data
analytics in cities?

83
00:06:30,102 --> 00:06:33,439
Okay Mohammed.
We see here 3 steps:

84
00:06:33,868 --> 00:06:36,880
First step is really defined
as more the city strategy

85
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:39,601
from a business point of view.
Where do you want to have

86
00:06:39,778 --> 00:06:42,840
the priorities? Where
do you want to achieve benefits?

87
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:46,997
Second one is then develop
the according ecosystem

88
00:06:47,190 --> 00:06:52,115
because there is many parties
has to participate in such a strategy.

89
00:06:52,465 --> 00:06:55,115
Then as the third, develop
the IT roadmap.

90
00:06:55,551 --> 00:06:59,613
Break down the silos.
Define an open data strategy

91
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:04,309
and approach with a step-by-step
implementation plan.

92
00:07:04,869 --> 00:07:10,519
From the approach point of view,
we see here clear that you must

93
00:07:10,698 --> 00:07:16,248
start and make successes visible
so that you can show the benefits

94
00:07:16,728 --> 00:07:20,903
of Smarter City projects.
Then, accept also failure.

95
00:07:21,104 --> 00:07:24,979
Go step-by-step and learn
and maybe correct

96
00:07:25,184 --> 00:07:30,759
and in all phases really
keep contact to all stakeholders.

97
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:35,142
Involve them from the beginning.
I think that is also a very

98
00:07:35,337 --> 00:07:38,412
important element of a
Smarter City transformation.

99
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:44,092
A very good example is actually
the collaboration that IBM has

100
00:07:44,372 --> 00:07:47,785
with Singapore; the Land
Transport Authority there

101
00:07:48,044 --> 00:07:52,682
and again Singapore is well known
for having a very strong strategy

102
00:07:52,881 --> 00:08:00,881
about the city.
Our journey also was a longer process

103
00:08:01,074 --> 00:08:05,086
but also a very agile one.
We started with small POC's,

104
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:08,876
Proof of Concepts, We started
with simulations and then slowly

105
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:15,687
put into practice what our
analytics are suggesting.

106
00:08:15,896 --> 00:08:19,021
The topic is basically
incident management.

107
00:08:19,224 --> 00:08:23,574
Whenever a metro line is
blocked by any means

108
00:08:23,751 --> 00:08:26,001
the people still have to
get from A to B

109
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:30,569
and it's of course a very dense area
so we want to then determine

110
00:08:30,747 --> 00:08:34,810
which buses and other modes of
transportation need to be

111
00:08:35,015 --> 00:08:38,840
put in place to bring the people
to their final destination

112
00:08:39,035 --> 00:08:44,085
with very little time. Of course
now we are in the phase

113
00:08:44,276 --> 00:08:47,901
of then rolling this out and I'm
sure the roadmap will continue.
