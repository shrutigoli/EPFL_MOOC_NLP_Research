1
00:00:04,834 --> 00:00:07,034
Welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:08,579 --> 00:00:10,954
So far you have seen three blocks.

3
00:00:11,035 --> 00:00:13,747
In the first block,
we defined smart cities

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,582
then in the second block, we talked
about smart urban energy systems

5
00:00:18,688 --> 00:00:20,601
and in the previous block we talked

6
00:00:20,693 --> 00:00:23,693
about smart urban
transportation systems.

7
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:28,021
In the next two blocks or weeks
we will talk about the transition

8
00:00:28,125 --> 00:00:33,050
to smart cities and the challenges
this transition raises.

9
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:38,551
In order to do that, let me first,
in one slide, conceptualize

10
00:00:38,674 --> 00:00:42,574
what transition is for us
and what it is

11
00:00:42,685 --> 00:00:45,110
from a system's perspective.

12
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:52,634
So the way we look at transition is
by defining sort of two dimensions

13
00:00:52,752 --> 00:00:58,215
two boundaries, on the one hand,
technology changes, and on the other

14
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:00,479
hand institutions change

15
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:03,620
and institutions are
the rules if the game.

16
00:01:04,002 --> 00:01:10,365
And the city as a socio-technical
system evolves as a result

17
00:01:10,474 --> 00:01:15,587
of interaction of technology
and institutional change

18
00:01:15,751 --> 00:01:17,638
and of course the driver

19
00:01:17,701 --> 00:01:21,776
the ultimate drivers of this
change are the actors.

20
00:01:21,899 --> 00:01:26,099
They take up the technology,
they play under particular rules

21
00:01:26,227 --> 00:01:31,852
and they create the dynamics of
the whole socio-technical system.

22
00:01:31,988 --> 00:01:38,400
Now, this leads to particular
services, the actors produce

23
00:01:38,553 --> 00:01:44,941
services, and these services
determine actually the performance

24
00:01:45,037 --> 00:01:48,037
of an urban infrastructure system.

25
00:01:48,541 --> 00:01:52,666
Now, this MOOC is about smart
cities, and we have already

26
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:57,349
insisted about the role that
digitalization plays in this.

27
00:01:57,468 --> 00:02:02,030
And digitalization is
extremely pervasive in that

28
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:07,407
it affects technological change,
it affects the institutional change

29
00:02:07,552 --> 00:02:10,827
and it affects the way
the actors behave.

30
00:02:11,729 --> 00:02:17,666
And so, digitalization becomes a new
driver of the transition of

31
00:02:17,796 --> 00:02:20,084
socio-technical systems.

32
00:02:20,349 --> 00:02:23,749
In the first block, and then applied
to the second, to energy and

33
00:02:23,862 --> 00:02:28,124
transportation systems, we have
come up with this distinction

34
00:02:28,267 --> 00:02:30,042
into three layers.

35
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:34,237
We have said that the smart city
is about an infrastructure layer

36
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:38,599
a digital or data layer,
and a services layer.

37
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:45,834
And again the services affect
the way the city performs

38
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,519
ultimately.

39
00:02:47,817 --> 00:02:50,817
So, the next two weeks
are structured as follows.

40
00:02:51,188 --> 00:02:55,713
First we will talk about transition,
and Muhammad will start out by

41
00:02:55,839 --> 00:02:59,927
talking about the transition
of socio-technical systems

42
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:04,780
in general, then I will come back
and talk about the transition

43
00:03:04,896 --> 00:03:08,033
of the digital, of the data layer

44
00:03:08,149 --> 00:03:11,511
and this will be illustrated by
a series of interviews

45
00:03:11,584 --> 00:03:13,022
from experts.

46
00:03:14,028 --> 00:03:18,316
In week five, we will talk in
particular about challenges.

47
00:03:18,382 --> 00:03:22,719
First the challenges on the services
layer, then the challenges on

48
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:27,027
the infrastructure layer, and then
we will bring all this together

49
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:31,301
an talk about what this
means for managers.

50
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:37,093
Finally we will conclude and
put all that into a context of 

51
00:03:37,222 --> 00:03:40,472
policy recommendations,
so stay tuned.
