00:00:05,367 --> 00:00:06,779
Hello, my name is Juan Montero

2
00:00:06,892 --> 00:00:08,742
I'm a professor of
administrative law

3
00:00:08,853 --> 00:00:12,866
in the UNED university in Madrid
and also a scientific adviser

4
00:00:12,976 --> 00:00:15,076
in the Florence's
school of Regulation.

5
00:00:15,216 --> 00:00:18,266
My research is focused on
the regulation and competition

6
00:00:18,413 --> 00:00:20,913
in the network industries,
particularly telecoms and

7
00:00:21,004 --> 00:00:23,154
transport, and over
the last couple of years

8
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:26,890
I have been working on
the regulation of the sharing

9
00:00:26,981 --> 00:00:28,306
economy.

10
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:31,765
Particularly in transportation
and accommodation.

11
00:00:39,137 --> 00:00:43,849
I think there is a fundamental
kind of legal regulatory challenge

12
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:45,285
when we are talking about smart

13
00:00:45,407 --> 00:00:47,970
cities and it is that
we have a clash

14
00:00:48,088 --> 00:00:50,800
between two regulatory traditions

15
00:00:50,914 --> 00:00:54,064
on the one hand we
have the traditional

16
00:00:54,177 --> 00:00:57,052
infrastructure, networks, services

17
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,180
provided in citizen terms of
telecommunications

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,450
transport, energy, etc.

19
00:01:02,564 --> 00:01:07,376
These kinds of networks and services
are closely linked to the territory

20
00:01:07,498 --> 00:01:11,573
where they are being established
or provided and what we have is

21
00:01:11,713 --> 00:01:14,263
local authorities, maybe
the regional, national

22
00:01:14,357 --> 00:01:17,032
always have an authority
that is very closely linked

23
00:01:17,142 --> 00:01:21,567
to the territory, regulation these
kinds of networks and services

24
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:27,228
and we have a tradition of very
intense regulation, in terms of

25
00:01:27,805 --> 00:01:32,030
licensing, sometimes exclusive
rights, or special rights of

26
00:01:32,121 --> 00:01:35,008
very often, public service
obligations, very often even

27
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:38,475
direct provision of the service
by the public authorities, so

28
00:01:38,574 --> 00:01:42,324
we have an established tradition of
intervention in these kinds of

29
00:01:42,454 --> 00:01:45,941
again networks and services, but
on the other hand we have a new

30
00:01:45,604 --> 00:01:48,604


31
00:01:46,026 --> 00:01:50,864
layer which we could call
the data layer, that comes from

32
00:01:50,982 --> 00:01:52,595
a very different tradition.

33
00:01:52,687 --> 00:01:58,124
Most of the providers of this data
services are global providers

34
00:01:58,216 --> 00:02:01,466
and they don't have a very
close link with the territory

35
00:02:01,588 --> 00:02:03,288
where the service is being provided.

36
00:02:03,412 --> 00:02:10,362
And even regulations have been
built over the years to, not link

37
00:02:10,514 --> 00:02:13,102
the provision of this services to
the territory, but on the contrary

38
00:02:13,211 --> 00:02:15,386
to provide the maximum flexibility

39
00:02:15,504 --> 00:02:17,804
for the provision of
these data services.

40
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:22,402
so when these data services
were rather virtual and they were

41
00:02:22,526 --> 00:02:27,214
rather related to the management
of information or content like

42
00:02:27,323 --> 00:02:31,760
like the impact they had on
the music industry, on the media

43
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:35,453
industry, it all remained pretty
much virtual, but what we are

44
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:39,751
understanding now that these data
layers have and impact also in

45
00:02:39,897 --> 00:02:42,447
the physical world, and the smart
cities it's probably one of

46
00:02:42,552 --> 00:02:46,164
the leading examples, where we see
how this data layer have an impact

47
00:02:46,284 --> 00:02:50,172
on the physical world in
terms of transport services

48
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:53,800
accommodation services,
energy, telecoms, etc.

49
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:58,854
And we are starting to see very
practical cases and examples

50
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:03,391
of this class of legitimacy between
the regulation of this traditional

51
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:06,716
network and services and
the regulation of this new

52
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:09,926
data layer above these
traditional services.

53
00:03:13,417 --> 00:03:16,417
I think that there are two very
good examples of this class of

54
00:03:16,521 --> 00:03:17,696
legitimacies. 

55
00:03:18,230 --> 00:03:20,717
The first one is transport,
and usually the sharing

56
00:03:20,821 --> 00:03:24,971
economy, transport companies, like
"Uber" or "Bla-Bla-Car"

57
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:29,125
"Lyft", there are lots of examples,
and what we see for instance

58
00:03:29,258 --> 00:03:33,771
is that local authorities
tend to apply the traditional

59
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:37,835
transport regulations to these
new companies, which tend to

60
00:03:37,939 --> 00:03:41,789
be again, very restrictive
in terms of licensing etc. 

61
00:03:42,262 --> 00:03:45,462
But then we have these new layer
services, because these companies

62
00:03:45,574 --> 00:03:48,974
I mean, they don't own cars,
they are not locally established

63
00:03:49,094 --> 00:03:51,769
for the provision of the transport
services, on the contrary

64
00:03:51,872 --> 00:03:56,809
they are just managing the data
layer above these traditional

65
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,234
transport services.

66
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,596
And what they claim is that
they are not subject to

67
00:04:01,717 --> 00:04:07,218
local transport regulations,
but rather to the regulation

68
00:04:07,328 --> 00:04:11,990
on digital services, typically
for instance, we have in Europe

69
00:04:12,082 --> 00:04:15,895
information, and e-commerce
directive that defines the category

70
00:04:16,009 --> 00:04:20,009
of information, society's services,
and very important to them

71
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,792
it's not only that this directive
provides regulations that

72
00:04:23,887 --> 00:04:29,687
even prohibits the obligation to
be licensed, and other restrictions

73
00:04:29,801 --> 00:04:33,626
that can be imposed in provision
of data services, but further more

74
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:36,684
they established the principal
that these services will be

75
00:04:36,766 --> 00:04:40,754
ruled by the legislation of
the country where the provider

76
00:04:40,854 --> 00:04:44,142
of the services established
enough of the country where

77
00:04:44,244 --> 00:04:47,581
the services being received,
so what we see is that 

78
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:49,784
transport services are regulated

79
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:51,933
very closely by
the local authorities

80
00:04:52,046 --> 00:04:56,146
but the data layer is regulated
according to the laws of a different

81
00:04:56,264 --> 00:05:00,352
country, and this of course creates
for a clash in the regulation of

82
00:05:00,461 --> 00:05:04,886
these services that is creating
many of the differences in

83
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:07,250
the interpretation of what
the regulation should be applied

84
00:05:07,336 --> 00:05:09,874
for instance, to "Uber",
to "Bla-Bla-Car".

85
00:05:09,998 --> 00:05:14,348
Another example in the accommodation
industry is the regulation of serving

86
00:05:14,429 --> 00:05:19,142
economy companies like "Air BnB",
and they have for instance

87
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:22,220
a strong conflict with
the authorities of the city of

88
00:05:22,391 --> 00:05:26,991
New York, which again want to
apply the local regulations

89
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:30,498
accommodation, also to
"Air BnB" to the data layer.

90
00:05:30,586 --> 00:05:34,698
And the automatic response of
"Air BnB" is that they are not

91
00:05:34,818 --> 00:05:41,131
subject to the local accommodation
regulations, but rather to the data

92
00:05:41,230 --> 00:05:45,105
layer regulations, and in particular
they claim that they should be

93
00:05:45,222 --> 00:05:48,435
subject to the decency
communications act

94
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:52,866
which exempts of liability to
the providers of just this

95
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:55,702
data layer services.

96
00:05:55,819 --> 00:05:59,519
So, I think these are two examples,
good examples of this clash of

97
00:05:59,588 --> 00:06:03,038
legitimacy between the local
traditional accommodation

98
00:06:03,134 --> 00:06:06,809
transportation, telecoms, energy
regulations and the regulation

99
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:10,394
of this new data layer
above all those services.

100
00:06:18,872 --> 00:06:22,422
It is not simple form a legal
regulatory and institutional

101
00:06:22,549 --> 00:06:27,249
point of view to provide clear cut
solutions, I think, solutions have

102
00:06:27,348 --> 00:06:30,998
to be designed for a specific
industry, for a specific service

103
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:34,603
but I think there are some
principals that can be defined.

104
00:06:35,492 --> 00:06:39,079
The points to be taken into
consideration for regulation

105
00:06:39,189 --> 00:06:43,127
of this new data services.

106
00:06:43,342 --> 00:06:48,004
I think the solution is not just
to impose the old regulatory

107
00:06:48,065 --> 00:06:50,640
framework, which tends
to be very restrictive

108
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:53,723
and that's not taking into
consideration these new services

109
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,881
but on the contrary, I don't think
it's just a matter of ignoring this

110
00:06:56,989 --> 00:07:00,639
local regulation and pretend
it doesn't exist, I think it's

111
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:05,590
necessary to provide, to adopt
a new regulation that first

112
00:07:05,715 --> 00:07:09,490
of all takes into consideration
the existence of data layer services

113
00:07:09,613 --> 00:07:14,213
only if we acknowledge that these
new services exist, we can provide

114
00:07:14,328 --> 00:07:17,328
a good regulation for them.

115
00:07:17,452 --> 00:07:19,890
The second one is that
regulation has to provide

116
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,311
a level playing field between
the traditional providers of

117
00:07:23,437 --> 00:07:28,062
transport, energy, telecom
services and the new providers

118
00:07:28,198 --> 00:07:32,386
of both of data services
and also of newcomers

119
00:07:32,503 --> 00:07:36,553
to the market that are
enabled to have access

120
00:07:36,696 --> 00:07:39,771
to the market, thanks to this data
layer, I mean all these drivers who

121
00:07:39,895 --> 00:07:43,970
work under the "Uber" scheme,
or all those people who are working

122
00:07:44,077 --> 00:07:45,777
with "Air BnB", I mean they have

123
00:07:45,866 --> 00:07:48,266
the right to participate in
the market, but we have to

124
00:07:48,322 --> 00:07:49,834
make sure that all the players

125
00:07:49,928 --> 00:07:52,628
are competing on
the level playing field.

126
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:57,162
A third principal would be that
traditional players should

127
00:07:57,246 --> 00:08:01,746
be allowed to adapt to the new
scenario, we should not have

128
00:08:01,859 --> 00:08:06,159
regulations that keep very strict
obligations on the providers of

129
00:08:06,289 --> 00:08:10,314
the services, that way
the restrictions do not allow

130
00:08:10,432 --> 00:08:14,694
these traditional players to compete
on equal footing with the newcomers.

131
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:19,105
And very importantly also,
it is very important that

132
00:08:19,239 --> 00:08:23,351
the overall regulatory regime
maintains a good equilibrium

133
00:08:23,454 --> 00:08:25,729
between all the interest in
the eco-system.

134
00:08:25,837 --> 00:08:29,662
We have now very different players
in different layers, and we have to

135
00:08:29,775 --> 00:08:33,850
make sure that the whole system
is sustainable in the sense

136
00:08:33,975 --> 00:08:35,850
for instance, that all
the investment that is

137
00:08:35,986 --> 00:08:41,274
necessary to deploy and
maintain the infrastructure 

138
00:08:41,417 --> 00:08:44,967
in terms of transport, in terms of
energy, in terms of telecoms

139
00:08:45,081 --> 00:08:50,531
all that infrastructure can operate
in a sustainable environment

140
00:08:50,623 --> 00:08:54,610
where financing for such
an infrastructure is ensured.

141
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:59,017
So we have to make sure that
we obstruct opportunistic market

142
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,938
entries that just extract value
from the whole eco-system

143
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:06,822
and do not make it possible to keep
the investment in the infrastructure

144
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,797
layer.

145
00:09:07,931 --> 00:09:10,731
And finally, I think it's important
to take into account

146
00:09:10,858 --> 00:09:14,896
that all these new technology that
the new data layer gives a lot of

147
00:09:14,996 --> 00:09:18,833
power to the user, to the citizen
and I think this is a very positive

148
00:09:18,973 --> 00:09:22,835
element and we should make sure
that the new regulation not only

149
00:09:22,958 --> 00:09:26,158
make sure that their citizen is
empowered, but that this power

150
00:09:26,239 --> 00:09:31,439
is increased, and I think this is
a central element, a new element

151
00:09:31,534 --> 00:09:37,384
that has to ensuring first by any
kind of regulation of this kind
