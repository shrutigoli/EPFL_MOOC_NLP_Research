1
00:00:05,497 --> 00:00:06,847
Welcome back.

2
00:00:07,075 --> 00:00:11,625
In this session we look at the
crucial role that the data layer

3
00:00:11,811 --> 00:00:14,848
is playing in the transition
to smart cities.

4
00:00:15,169 --> 00:00:20,719
We do this in 3 steps:
First I will talk about

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:23,470
why the data layer is
so crucial

6
00:00:23,662 --> 00:00:29,637
then I will try to identify what
the data layer is exactly about.

7
00:00:30,106 --> 00:00:34,506
Thirdly we will raise a series of
questions that all need to be

8
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:40,231
addressed if we want to make the 
transition to smart cities a success.

9
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:45,273
Getting the data layer, the digital
layer right is an important

10
00:00:45,472 --> 00:00:50,384
precondition for performing
smart city services.

11
00:00:50,776 --> 00:00:55,026
We have seen that in the previous
session when Mohammed talked about

12
00:00:55,202 --> 00:01:00,252
path dependency. Graphically
this can be represented

13
00:01:00,438 --> 00:01:06,675
something like this. Over time
services are being rolled out

14
00:01:06,902 --> 00:01:14,552
which contribute to more performing
urban infrastructure systems.

15
00:01:14,785 --> 00:01:21,872
Getting the data layer right is a
precondition for having the services

16
00:01:22,085 --> 00:01:26,460
function and being able
to be rolled out.

17
00:01:26,674 --> 00:01:29,986
This is a typical
path dependency problem.

18
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:34,906
What is this data or digital
layer exactly?

19
00:01:35,114 --> 00:01:39,602
In the first block, you remember,
when we talked about networks

20
00:01:39,823 --> 00:01:44,985
we identified 3 layers. We had a
physical telecommunication

21
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:50,129
infrastructure, wired or wireless.
Then we had networks;

22
00:01:50,349 --> 00:01:54,861
typically the internet and then
we had the identification and

23
00:01:55,071 --> 00:01:59,408
exchange of data; typically
the World Wide Web.

24
00:02:00,068 --> 00:02:05,218
In the context of a smart city
what is particularly important

25
00:02:05,428 --> 00:02:09,503
for the data layer is this
connection of the devices

26
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:13,796
to each other; the internet of
things as we have also said.

27
00:02:14,186 --> 00:02:20,323
This requires technical
interoperability and standards

28
00:02:20,518 --> 00:02:24,568
so that actually all the
data generating devices

29
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:30,536
can be connected to each other.
The second element that is crucial

30
00:02:30,888 --> 00:02:36,800
for this digital or data layer
is the fact that the data can be

31
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:42,890
identified and accessed and
exchanged as a result of that.

32
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:49,273
This is mainly a question of norms
and regulation whereby access rules

33
00:02:49,488 --> 00:02:55,975
are defined, locations are identified
and accessibility is granted.

34
00:02:56,887 --> 00:03:01,787
From here we can raise a series
of questions. Those are all the

35
00:03:01,994 --> 00:03:08,607
questions that are crucial for the
digital layer to function properly.

36
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:12,933
Let's start with the first question.
I already mentioned before;

37
00:03:13,152 --> 00:03:18,127
It's this question of standards.
It is not -- The digital layer

38
00:03:18,338 --> 00:03:23,650
cannot function properly if the
devices that generate the data

39
00:03:23,885 --> 00:03:28,122
cannot be connected to each other.
This is typically a question

40
00:03:28,314 --> 00:03:34,127
of standards. The second question
is a question of 

41
00:03:34,352 --> 00:03:39,302
ownership of the data. This is a
question that somehow needs to be

42
00:03:39,527 --> 00:03:43,402
decided so that the data layer
can function properly.

43
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:48,748
Who owns the data? Is it the telecom
operator that transports them?

44
00:03:48,948 --> 00:03:55,036
Is it the owner of the devices
that generates them?

45
00:03:55,221 --> 00:04:00,534
Is it the individual from whose
house these data actually come?

46
00:04:00,753 --> 00:04:05,665
Is it the one who buys the data?
This question of ownership also

47
00:04:05,871 --> 00:04:10,959
needs to be clarified for the
data layer to function properly.

48
00:04:11,154 --> 00:04:15,867
The third question is the question
of accessibility of data.

49
00:04:16,358 --> 00:04:21,908
What good is it to have data
if they are not accessible?

50
00:04:23,245 --> 00:04:27,820
Who has access to this data?
Are these data openly accessible;

51
00:04:28,044 --> 00:04:31,094
something that today
is called open data.

52
00:04:31,302 --> 00:04:35,252
Are they restricted to some users?
Are they only accessible to

53
00:04:35,478 --> 00:04:40,615
the highest bidder? Those are -- or
are they just accessible to the ones

54
00:04:40,834 --> 00:04:44,222
who have generated it and
to whom he wants to sell it?

55
00:04:44,567 --> 00:04:48,329
These are the kind of questions that
also need to be decided.

56
00:04:48,763 --> 00:04:52,488
The fourth question is a standard
question but it's the question about

57
00:04:52,704 --> 00:04:57,467
the security and the privacy of
the data. If data are not secure

58
00:04:57,668 --> 00:05:02,718
and if privacy is not guaranteed
then the data layer may simply

59
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:08,221
not function. The fifth question is
the one about the pricing

60
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:13,964
of the data. Data generation
has a price. Those are devices;

61
00:05:14,156 --> 00:05:18,556
that there is a cost. The question
is what is the price of the data?

62
00:05:18,762 --> 00:05:23,112
Should they be given for free and in
which case, who pays actually the

63
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:26,478
real cost that the data have?
Maybe it's the customers

64
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:30,719
who give their own data and
somebody makes money with them.

65
00:05:32,144 --> 00:05:37,531
It's really a matter of what is
a good pricing policy about data?

66
00:05:37,748 --> 00:05:40,223
These question have to be
clarified as well.

67
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:44,121
Then the sixth question is about
the reliability of data.

68
00:05:44,330 --> 00:05:50,255
What good is it to have data
if you cannot rely upon them

69
00:05:50,468 --> 00:05:53,168
to provide good services;
if they are wrong,

70
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:58,075
false, manipulated;
questions like this.

71
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:04,376
Then the seventh question may
be a little bit more theoretical

72
00:06:04,593 --> 00:06:07,943
question but it's the question
about the location of the data.

73
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,150
Where are these
data platforms?

74
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:14,065
Are they within the firms?
Are they within the city?

75
00:06:14,276 --> 00:06:18,538
Are they in a country?
Are they in the global cloud?

76
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:21,393


77
00:06:19,461 --> 00:06:22,961
This is a technical question,
an economic question

78
00:06:23,142 --> 00:06:26,404
but can also be
a political question.

79
00:06:27,163 --> 00:06:31,050
Okay so basically
we have 2 issues here:

80
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:35,954
One is an issue of standards and
ideally the standards are set

81
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:41,874
by the industry but if the industry is
not capable of setting the standards

82
00:06:42,074 --> 00:06:45,361
then it may also become
a regulatory question;

83
00:06:45,558 --> 00:06:49,383
like most of the other questions
are actually regulatory questions.

84
00:06:49,661 --> 00:06:54,486
Those are decision that need to be
made about the ownership,

85
00:06:54,693 --> 00:07:00,643
about the privacy, about
the location and that is

86
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:04,897
actually regulation
that decides on these things.

87
00:07:05,188 --> 00:07:10,013
In this session we saw why
the data layer is so crucial.

88
00:07:10,312 --> 00:07:13,587
What it is about
and the main questions

89
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:17,665
that you need to ask
to get the data layer right.

90
00:07:17,995 --> 00:07:18,895
Stay tuned.
