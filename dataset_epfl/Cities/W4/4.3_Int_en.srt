1
00:00:04,762 --> 00:00:06,598
Hello and welcome back
to the course.

2
00:00:06,798 --> 00:00:09,448
Today, I have the pleasure of
being with Dr Alain Staron.

3
00:00:09,648 --> 00:00:13,061
He is the director of digital
transformation at the Veolia group.

4
00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:15,598
He is in charge
of the strategy, partnerships

5
00:00:15,798 --> 00:00:17,998
and new services development. 

6
00:00:18,198 --> 00:00:20,024
- Welcome Alain.
- Thank you, good morning.

7
00:00:20,224 --> 00:00:22,126
Than you very much
for being with us.

8
00:00:22,326 --> 00:00:24,101
Let me ask you my first question.

9
00:00:24,312 --> 00:00:26,954
Can you elaborate,
as an expert in the field,

10
00:00:27,154 --> 00:00:30,503
what is the impact of digitalisation
on urban infrastructures?

11
00:00:32,416 --> 00:00:36,086
I will start by talking about
water and energy.

12
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:39,736
The two main things where
Veolia is working hard.

13
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:42,936
You have to consider infrastructures

14
00:00:43,136 --> 00:00:46,136
are very difficult things to manage.

15
00:00:48,248 --> 00:00:51,474
That takes kilometers,
thousands of kilometers, 

16
00:00:51,674 --> 00:00:55,937
to get water or energy
going through any household.

17
00:00:56,148 --> 00:00:59,148
And the difficulty of it is,
how do we manage it? 

18
00:00:59,348 --> 00:01:01,961
We use to have good expertise,
very good expertise,

19
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:05,161
to understand and modelize
things we don't see

20
00:01:05,494 --> 00:01:08,494
because these pipes are underground.

21
00:01:09,518 --> 00:01:13,273
What is happening with
digitalisation is

22
00:01:13,473 --> 00:01:18,493
we get more and more sensors that
will help you with measuring

23
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:20,433
what is happening underneath.

24
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,295

25
00:01:22,492 --> 00:01:25,952
You can have one every
hundred meters, 10 meters

26
00:01:26,251 --> 00:01:27,657
And the result of this is,

27
00:01:28,539 --> 00:01:33,819
instead of having only your brain to
understand what is going on underneath,

28
00:01:34,032 --> 00:01:36,668
you will get real measures

29
00:01:36,868 --> 00:01:38,734
and you will get much more info

30
00:01:38,934 --> 00:01:42,497
about the exact behaviour
of your infrastructure. 

31
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:48,317
Doing so, it'll be much easier for
you to understand what is happening.

32
00:01:48,517 --> 00:01:49,867
I would say more.

33
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:53,326
You will understand, we will
understand but our machines

34
00:01:53,526 --> 00:01:56,526
might understand better,
even better than us.

35
00:01:56,726 --> 00:02:00,364
At the end of the day,
the software, the programs, 

36
00:02:00,564 --> 00:02:02,051
the algorithms we develop

37
00:02:02,252 --> 00:02:08,021
will help us manage infrastructure
much better than we do now because

38
00:02:08,246 --> 00:02:13,194
it would be more customised
to any infrastructure in a city

39
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:15,644
because it takes the
measurements of any city.

40
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,844
It's not just the global weathering,
it's any city measurement.

41
00:02:19,044 --> 00:02:22,470
It'll be much more accurate
in terms of space

42
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,295
because we can get
a lot of sensors.

43
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:27,949
It will be much more accurate
in terms of timing.

44
00:02:28,199 --> 00:02:30,668
You would be able to get
measurements every minute.

45
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:35,077
So, it would be much easier
to manage the system globally.

46
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:38,111
Great, and then other dimensions
than the management

47
00:02:38,311 --> 00:02:40,798
can you elaborate - what about
the other dimensions?

48
00:02:40,998 --> 00:02:43,348
not just the management
of the infrastructures?

49
00:02:43,535 --> 00:02:45,652
The good thing is with
these kind of sensors

50
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:48,151
you get more info than the
one you expected to.

51
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,790
You expect it for water,
you expect about pressure,

52
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:52,377
for example, or flow.

53
00:02:52,914 --> 00:02:55,962
You will be able to get much
better, much more information.

54
00:02:56,162 --> 00:02:57,728
Take one example:

55
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:00,928
We used to manage water
into the household.

56
00:03:01,128 --> 00:03:03,207
Now, with the smart meters

57
00:03:03,407 --> 00:03:05,232
we even can measure

58
00:03:05,444 --> 00:03:08,924
the exact instantaneous flow that is
going into the household.

59
00:03:09,168 --> 00:03:12,848
We can measure it at night
and we can elaborate

60
00:03:13,048 --> 00:03:18,177
the probability for any leakage
in house because we will measure it.

61
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:20,112
That's a big change.

62
00:03:20,312 --> 00:03:24,261
That's when we could first
reassure the end user.

63
00:03:24,461 --> 00:03:26,041
Telling him 'Hey, be careful'.

64
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:29,140
Second, we can put him in touch
with a plumber that would help.

65
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,921
And thirdly, we can sell insurance.

66
00:03:32,121 --> 00:03:34,667
So you can see how
from a single sensor

67
00:03:34,867 --> 00:03:37,867
we can derive
more benefit for the end user.

68
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:41,860
A better marketplace
and even more services.

69
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,235
Great, so you know both
on the management side

70
00:03:44,435 --> 00:03:46,810
and the services side you can
really get, you know,

71
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:50,396
new and more innovative ways
to organise things better.

72
00:03:50,842 --> 00:03:53,270
That's great, can you
also elaborate

73
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:56,794
what is the impact of this
digitalisation of infrastructures

74
00:03:56,994 --> 00:04:00,157
to reach what is so-called
known as "smart cities".

75
00:04:00,357 --> 00:04:01,531
That's very interesting.

76
00:04:01,744 --> 00:04:04,744
Smart cities, the study, the concept
started about 10 years ago.

77
00:04:04,944 --> 00:04:08,471
It was really about that time,
you know, big machines,

78
00:04:08,671 --> 00:04:10,684
big software infrastructures.

79
00:04:11,395 --> 00:04:12,824
I.T.

80
00:04:13,024 --> 00:04:16,024
The concept and the
target is the same

81
00:04:16,224 --> 00:04:20,083
the means to actually
reach the target are different.

82
00:04:20,283 --> 00:04:23,004
For me, smart cities, is very simply

83
00:04:23,204 --> 00:04:26,204
is the way the cities
are transforming themselves.

84
00:04:26,404 --> 00:04:29,404
The digital transformation of cities - 
is called "Smart City".

85
00:04:29,604 --> 00:04:31,790
All of us, we transform ourselves.

86
00:04:32,564 --> 00:04:34,240
Companies transform themselves.

87
00:04:34,427 --> 00:04:37,259
There's no reason cities
should not transform themselves.

88
00:04:37,459 --> 00:04:41,838
So "smart city" is the exact way
cities are transforming themselves

89
00:04:42,037 --> 00:04:43,363
thanks to digitalisation.

90
00:04:43,563 --> 00:04:45,302
What is the impact of this?

91
00:04:45,502 --> 00:04:49,865
Once we get so many data
that improve the performance,

92
00:04:50,065 --> 00:04:53,065
you see that you can
go up to the end user.

93
00:04:53,265 --> 00:04:55,308


94
00:04:55,508 --> 00:04:58,508
And the point for us is

95
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:02,321
with more and more sensors 

96
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:04,656
understanding of what is happening

97
00:05:04,856 --> 00:05:07,344
you can give more power
to the end user

98
00:05:07,544 --> 00:05:10,544
in the way he helps us
managing the resources.

99
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:14,088
At the end of the day
you get showers,

100
00:05:14,288 --> 00:05:17,013
bath and that's the way
you use water.

101
00:05:17,232 --> 00:05:20,569
If there's a direct relationship
between what you are doing

102
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:23,631
your usage and the impact
on the global city,

103
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:26,829
you start to become "electro"
in your city.

104
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:28,607
So for a smart city

105
00:05:28,807 --> 00:05:31,807
the digital transformation
in cities is the way

106
00:05:32,007 --> 00:05:34,644
to get back the citizen,
the inhabitants 

107
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:37,207
inside the global management
of the city.

108
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:39,112
Great. Which is traditionally done

109
00:05:39,312 --> 00:05:41,849
basically by the city government
and the companies

110
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:45,711
but now you're talking about having
the citizens also being part of this.

111
00:05:45,937 --> 00:05:47,762
How disruptive is this
for the cities?

112
00:05:47,962 --> 00:05:50,398
Can you elaborate?
What are the, you know,

113
00:05:50,598 --> 00:05:53,598
 big consequences,
futuristic consequences

114
00:05:53,798 --> 00:05:55,572
of having that into the game?

115
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,701
The future is back to basics.

116
00:05:57,901 --> 00:06:02,404
The first cities,
back 2000 years ago, before Christ.

117
00:06:02,604 --> 00:06:05,032
You have cities
of about 40,000 people.

118
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,795
With this kind of scale

119
00:06:06,995 --> 00:06:09,995
it was quite possible to get
everyone involved in the city.

120
00:06:10,818 --> 00:06:13,432
With millions
and millions inhabitants in cities

121
00:06:13,632 --> 00:06:15,078
that becomes impossible.

122
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:19,200
What is happening with the
future of the infrastructures

123
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,334
The decentalized infrastructures.
The fact they do not need anymore

124
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:25,748
top-down approach
to get your basic services.

125
00:06:22,534 --> 00:06:25,534


126
00:06:25,948 --> 00:06:30,289
And that you have locally produced,
produced by the end user,

127
00:06:30,489 --> 00:06:33,489
"prosumers" that produce and
consume at the same time.

128
00:06:33,689 --> 00:06:35,605
You can start to have,

129
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:39,905
 to liberate the
geographical constraint of the city.

130
00:06:40,119 --> 00:06:45,531
You can start to have anyone living
everywhere with the same service

131
00:06:45,731 --> 00:06:47,799
that if you were
living inside the city.

132
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,738
And if you consider that 

133
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:52,437
more than half of human beings
live in cities,

134
00:06:52,637 --> 00:06:54,991
including in Asia in 2013

135
00:06:55,351 --> 00:06:58,468
and 85% in western countries.

136
00:06:58,668 --> 00:07:01,668
You can consider that
almost everyone,

137
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:05,207
every human being is a normal being.

138
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,736
Then you have to consider now
that city is no more an exception

139
00:07:09,936 --> 00:07:11,515
a city is the way we live.

140
00:07:11,758 --> 00:07:15,984
And so the surface of the earth
will be cities in a new sense

141
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:18,400
not geographically concentrated.

142
00:07:18,616 --> 00:07:22,712
But thanks to infrastructure,
digitalisation, new technologies

143
00:07:22,912 --> 00:07:25,368
everyone will be able to get,
in every place,

144
00:07:25,568 --> 00:07:27,139
the same services it used to get

145
00:07:27,339 --> 00:07:29,931
with with some limitations,
in existing cities today.

146
00:07:30,115 --> 00:07:32,526
Great, thank you very much Alain
for your insights.

147
00:07:32,739 --> 00:07:34,977
You're welcome, thank you very much.
