So far we have talked to you about the transition of cities as sociotechnical systems. We have talked about the importance of the digital layer in that transition and you have heard from various experts about elements of that digital layer.
Now let us briefly come back to the question of sequencing.
There have been raised a series of questions that need to be addressed for the digital layer to function properly and here these questions are again.
While these questions all need to be addressed at some point, the sequencing of how they're addressed may vary from city to city.
What we can say is that some questions ideally should be addressed at the industry level; like questions of standards typically.
If they are not addressed at the industry level then probably they will be addressed at the national level or at the super-national level.
In the case of Europe, this would typically be the EU.
There are a series of questions which can or should be addressed at the city level; like questions of location of the data, like questions of ownership, questions of transparency and accuracy of the data.
Now that we have seen what it takes to transit to Smart Cities in terms of getting the data or the digital layer right, and now that we have seen what can be obtained from these data from the presentation of Professor Faltings. let us now turn to the services and challenges that a transition to Smart Cities raises for the services layer.
