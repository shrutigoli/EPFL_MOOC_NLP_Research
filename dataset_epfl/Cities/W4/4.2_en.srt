00:00:05,379 --> 00:00:07,166
Hello and welcome
back to the course.

2
00:00:07,304 --> 00:00:10,779
My name is Mohamad Razaghi,
I'm a researcher at EPFL

3
00:00:10,899 --> 00:00:14,287
and in this session I would
like to share our approach

4
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:17,416
towards transition to
smart cities with you.

5
00:00:17,603 --> 00:00:22,428
My core argument in this session
is that in socio-technical systems

6
00:00:22,544 --> 00:00:27,107
which cities are of course great
examples of such systems,

7
00:00:27,236 --> 00:00:30,649
We are dealing with complexity.

8
00:00:30,788 --> 00:00:34,088
And that, to manage and
govern the transition process

9
00:00:34,171 --> 00:00:39,409
in such complex context, three
key considerations are vital.

10
00:00:40,443 --> 00:00:45,531
First to have a Holistic approach,
second to have a long term

11
00:00:45,651 --> 00:00:49,326
perspective, and third
to be flexible

12
00:00:49,437 --> 00:00:52,437
in managing
the process of transition.

13
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:55,969
Let me start with the notion
of complexity in socio-technical

14
00:00:56,128 --> 00:00:58,265
systems and what does that mean.

15
00:00:58,592 --> 00:01:01,629
As you know, feedback
loops are essential elements

16
00:01:01,746 --> 00:01:03,496
when we are talking about systems.

17
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:06,448
In socio-technical systems,
the feedback loops

18
00:01:06,587 --> 00:01:11,199
are present at the technical.
the social. and what we call

19
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:13,800
the socio-technical levels.

20
00:01:14,147 --> 00:01:17,372
In the technical level,
we have feedback loops

21
00:01:17,507 --> 00:01:22,032
both inside and across
different sub-systems.

22
00:01:22,163 --> 00:01:23,713
Let's for example think of

23
00:01:23,815 --> 00:01:26,815
the transportation or
the energy systems.

24
00:01:27,202 --> 00:01:30,815
As an example of feedback loops
inside these technical systems

25
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:33,183
you can for example imagine how

26
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:37,531
changes in the rooting, or
the roots of the bus systems

27
00:01:37,623 --> 00:01:43,373
will have impact on the demand for
the metro or the light rail system

28
00:01:43,492 --> 00:01:44,730
in the city. 

29
00:01:45,258 --> 00:01:49,283
As an example of feedback loops
across different technical systems

30
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:52,134
you can think for an example,
the impact of introducing

31
00:01:52,233 --> 00:01:55,971
electric buses in
the transportation network

32
00:01:56,087 --> 00:02:01,450
and the effects that it would have
on the demand on the electricity

33
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:05,093
and the energy
infrastructure in the city.

34
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:10,767
Feedback loops are also exist in
the social level, as we call that.

35
00:02:11,029 --> 00:02:15,067
For example, between the economy
and the social sub-systems

36
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:18,325
between the economic and
the political sub-systems

37
00:02:18,449 --> 00:02:21,199
and so on and so forth, so you
can think of that between

38
00:02:21,318 --> 00:02:23,981
the economy and
the environment and so on.

39
00:02:24,218 --> 00:02:29,543
But also, the feedback loops exist
in the overall socio-technical

40
00:02:29,657 --> 00:02:32,469
system and this is what is
really important for us

41
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,945
when talking about transition
towards the smart cities.

42
00:02:36,241 --> 00:02:38,703
For example, let me
give you an example

43
00:02:38,831 --> 00:02:43,131
of a new subsidies scheme
on public transportation tariffs.

44
00:02:43,601 --> 00:02:48,463
This new tariff system can
be seen as an economic decision.

45
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:54,645
But, introducing this change
can have very profound impacts

46
00:02:54,772 --> 00:02:59,684
on all the other sub-systems as well
such as putting more pressure

47
00:02:59,805 --> 00:03:01,842
on the transportation
infrastructure

48
00:03:01,955 --> 00:03:04,368
due to the increasing demand
for public transportation

49
00:03:04,474 --> 00:03:06,287
services by the citizens.

50
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:10,016
Now the service is cheaper,
so the demand might go higher.

51
00:03:10,136 --> 00:03:14,298
Also, the availability of more
affordable public transportation

52
00:03:14,398 --> 00:03:17,611
in the city, might affect
the citizen's choice

53
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:19,802
of place for living.

54
00:03:19,936 --> 00:03:23,636
For example, you can imagine
that those groups in the city

55
00:03:23,731 --> 00:03:27,518
that are less advantaged,
compared to the other ones

56
00:03:27,984 --> 00:03:32,021
might decide to move to
the outer side of the city

57
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:37,326
where the housing is more affordable
while they can still commune to

58
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:40,818
the city center and access
to their jobs thanks to

59
00:03:40,927 --> 00:03:46,189
the availability of these cheap
public transpiration tariff scheme

60
00:03:45,245 --> 00:03:48,245


61
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:48,838
that is already introduced
in the system.

62
00:03:49,342 --> 00:03:53,467
This can have the significant
impact on the social dimensions of

63
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:56,513
life in the city as well, for
example you can imagine

64
00:03:56,612 --> 00:04:00,624
how it can result in
deeper social segregation

65
00:04:00,726 --> 00:04:03,013
between different neighborhood
in the city, because

66
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:06,233
not anymore, all the groups
of the citizens are living

67
00:04:06,359 --> 00:04:09,096
in one place, someone living in one
neighborhood, the other ones are

68
00:04:09,246 --> 00:04:11,496
living in other neighborhoods,
which are more advantaged

69
00:04:11,581 --> 00:04:14,981
probably, or even on the political
dimension of, you know

70
00:04:15,093 --> 00:04:17,080
governance and management
of the city, for example

71
00:04:17,177 --> 00:04:22,152
you can imagine how this new tariff
system can help the current

72
00:04:22,265 --> 00:04:25,978
administration to win the next
election, probably, because

73
00:04:26,093 --> 00:04:30,005
this new tariff system would be
very visible to the eyes of

74
00:04:30,124 --> 00:04:33,612
the citizens, while benefiting
from that tariff.

75
00:04:34,437 --> 00:04:38,137
This simple example already
shows the three important

76
00:04:38,262 --> 00:04:41,062
characteristics in
socio-technical system

77
00:04:41,195 --> 00:04:43,157
which result in complexity.

78
00:04:43,282 --> 00:04:48,020
Namely, the inter-dependency,
which means that a change

79
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:51,818
or the ultimate performance of
one sub-system in the broader

80
00:04:51,915 --> 00:04:55,514
socio-technical system will
have impacts on the performance

81
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,248
of other sub-systems as well,
and ultimately this is

82
00:04:59,385 --> 00:05:02,510
the combination of the performance
of all these sub-systems

83
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:06,020
which will result in the performance
of the overall system and each of

84
00:05:06,098 --> 00:05:08,473
them in isolation.

85
00:05:08,918 --> 00:05:11,993
The second important point
here is the past dependency

86
00:05:12,113 --> 00:05:15,926
which means that every change
or decision in a socio-technical

87
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:20,874
system is dependent on the changes
that occurred on the system in

88
00:05:20,985 --> 00:05:26,110
the previous stages, which often
take quite some time until their

89
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:29,002
effects become fully
utilized in this system

90
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,745
and are observable and
become tangible for the citizens

91
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,366
and the decision-makers,
of course.

92
00:05:35,429 --> 00:05:38,104
And last but not least,
we are talking about

93
00:05:38,245 --> 00:05:40,045
irreversibility.

94
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,355
Irreversibility means that
we cannot just undo

95
00:05:44,469 --> 00:05:47,606
the impact of the decisions
that we made and the changes

96
00:05:47,734 --> 00:05:50,309
that we introduced in
the socio-technical systems

97
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:53,652
because the impacts of
the change in one sub-system

98
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:58,906
is affecting many other sub-systems
as well, and often over a very

99
00:05:59,003 --> 00:06:04,203
long period of time, which makes
it almost impossible to redo

100
00:06:04,314 --> 00:06:07,626
the effects that one change
or one decision has in

101
00:06:07,733 --> 00:06:09,658
the socio-technical system.

102
00:06:10,033 --> 00:06:12,496
Let us now discuss what
are the implications of

103
00:06:12,573 --> 00:06:15,273
of these important features
of socio-technical systems

104
00:06:15,373 --> 00:06:17,798
for management and
governance of the transition

105
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:19,349
towards the smart city.

106
00:06:20,191 --> 00:06:23,191
The interdependence here
among different sub-systems

107
00:06:23,275 --> 00:06:27,313
offer socio-technical system call
for adopting a Holistic and

108
00:06:27,431 --> 00:06:30,581
quite often a multidisciplinary
approach, then managing

109
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:33,671
the transition process
towards the smart cities.

110
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:41,265
Indeed, because introducing changes
in one infrastructure will influence

111
00:06:41,362 --> 00:06:47,724
on and will be influenced by changes
in other sub-systems of our broader

112
00:06:47,853 --> 00:06:51,853
socio-technical system, we have to
have a Holistic approach

113
00:06:51,983 --> 00:06:56,195
in managing the different elements
of the transition process

114
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,581
towards the smart cities.

115
00:06:59,212 --> 00:07:03,625
By adopting a holistic approach,
I mean that we have to consider

116
00:07:03,717 --> 00:07:09,317
technological, economic, social
political, institutional

117
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:13,274
and also very importantly
environmental considerations.

118
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:18,187
In a holistic fashion, and not
just in isolation from each other.

119
00:07:18,442 --> 00:07:21,105
Then, we are trying to
manage the process of transition 

120
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:23,045
towards the smart cities.

121
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:27,021
Without such a Holistic approach,
new initiatives in complex

122
00:07:27,138 --> 00:07:29,651
socio-technical systems. like
the smart cities

123
00:07:29,726 --> 00:07:34,151
often fail, or even result in
adverse effects that we don't

124
00:07:34,271 --> 00:07:37,271
even foresee them in
advance and will

125
00:07:37,359 --> 00:07:40,784
distort the performance
of the system, potentially.

126
00:07:41,254 --> 00:07:44,641
The past dependency of changes
in socio-technical systems 

127
00:07:44,767 --> 00:07:48,230
calls for adopting a long term
perspective in management

128
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:51,342
and governance of transition
towards the smart cities.

129
00:07:51,544 --> 00:07:54,844
Let me benefit from S curve
innovation to elaborate

130
00:07:54,962 --> 00:07:56,262
on this point.

131
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,145
The S curve innovation, which is

132
00:07:58,252 --> 00:08:00,940
the result of a lot of
empirical research

133
00:08:01,082 --> 00:08:05,495
shows us that the performance
or progress of introducing

134
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:09,273
an innovation, which can be
technical or institutional

135
00:08:09,371 --> 00:08:11,259
is dependent on time.

136
00:08:11,375 --> 00:08:14,950
But the relationship between
the time and the progress

137
00:08:15,041 --> 00:08:17,878
of an innovation is
not a linear relation.

138
00:08:18,165 --> 00:08:22,527
Indeed as you can see in this graph,
innovations often take quite some

139
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:26,754
significant time to be developed,
until they reach a point where

140
00:08:26,872 --> 00:08:31,184
we can see a rapid progress
in terms of their performance gains.

141
00:08:31,327 --> 00:08:34,515
This is this rapid growth that
you can see in the graph.

142
00:08:34,742 --> 00:08:39,342
And after this rapid growth phase
innovations often enter a period of

143
00:08:39,463 --> 00:08:43,176
relatively stable progress,
when their performance

144
00:08:43,284 --> 00:08:46,547
does not significantly
change over time anymore.

145
00:08:43,716 --> 00:08:46,716


146
00:08:46,967 --> 00:08:49,829
This means that when
a new innovation, being

147
00:08:49,971 --> 00:08:54,033
technological, or institutional,
is introduced in a city

148
00:08:54,146 --> 00:08:58,121
to help the city move toward
becoming more smart

149
00:08:58,254 --> 00:09:02,841
a relatively light period of time
will be required until the expected

150
00:09:02,952 --> 00:09:08,140
performance from this innovation
can be utilized, and an important

151
00:09:08,259 --> 00:09:11,671
point here is that, the different
innovations have their own

152
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:15,096
different S curves as well,
for an example

153
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:18,879
the technological innovations
we can look at the rat care

154
00:09:18,966 --> 00:09:22,316
for an example in this graph,
often reach to their maximum

155
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:25,851
progress in a shorter period of time
that when you compare it

156
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:29,527
with social or institutional
innovations, which you can think of

157
00:09:29,636 --> 00:09:32,636
them as yellow or
the green curves here.

158
00:09:33,051 --> 00:09:37,251
But, as we discussed before
transition in socio-technical

159
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:41,733
systems is not the result of
changes in one single sub-system

160
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:47,199
but is indeed the result of
a series of changes in these

161
00:09:47,328 --> 00:09:50,678
interdependent sub-systems
after broader socio-technical

162
00:09:50,783 --> 00:09:51,783
system.

163
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:57,528
So, we need even longer times
until all the introduced changes

164
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:01,212
in the system reach to their
expected performance level

165
00:10:01,296 --> 00:10:03,846
the technological innovations,
the social innovations

166
00:10:03,961 --> 00:10:06,661
the financial innovations,
and so on, and so forth.

167
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:10,085
And this implies that without
the long term perspective

168
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:15,618
introducing new initiatives in
the city often result in failure.

169
00:10:16,369 --> 00:10:19,981
The irreversibility of changes
in the socio-technical systems

170
00:10:20,106 --> 00:10:22,318
is one of the main reason
we need to adopt

171
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:26,844
a flexible approach in management
and governance of transition towards

172
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,348
the smart cities.

173
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,440
Innovations such as the ones
that we have already discussed in

174
00:10:31,568 --> 00:10:34,568
the smart energy, and the smart
transportation blocks

175
00:10:34,815 --> 00:10:40,240
can introduce significant changes in
established infrastructure systems

176
00:10:40,348 --> 00:10:43,798
and hopefully they can also improve
the performance of the systems.

177
00:10:43,958 --> 00:10:48,758
But, unfortunately innovations
often fail, and the rate of failure 

178
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,378
among innovations in
socio-technical systems

179
00:10:51,447 --> 00:10:54,322
is even higher, something
around 90%.

180
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:57,114
As you can see,
in this simplified diagram

181
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:00,596
only few innovations would
 eventually become a part of

182
00:11:00,723 --> 00:11:03,648
the existing socio-technical
systems, while most of

183
00:11:03,708 --> 00:11:07,508
the others fail in different
stages of their life-cycle.

184
00:11:07,763 --> 00:11:11,601
This can be seen, for example in
the case of different innovations

185
00:11:11,683 --> 00:11:16,633
to realize the idea of driver-less
vehicles, or the different renewable

186
00:11:16,737 --> 00:11:22,725
energy technologies, where only
one or very few often existing

187
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:26,314
technologies will ultimately
become the dominant technology

188
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:30,114
in the sector, and this is indeed
the battle the different companies

189
00:11:30,182 --> 00:11:34,582
are trying to win at this stage of
transition towards the smart cities.

190
00:11:35,709 --> 00:11:40,634
Because most of the innovations are
doomed to failure, unfortunately 

191
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:44,869
and because all decision and changes
in socio-technical systems are not

192
00:11:45,012 --> 00:11:50,150
easily reversible, it is very
important that we try to keep

193
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:55,799
all the options that are
available as long as possible

194
00:11:55,914 --> 00:12:00,414
that we can, and to avoid becoming
locked in premature technologies

195
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:03,530
that might prove to be
failures in a few years.

196
00:12:03,914 --> 00:12:07,927
This is even more important when
we consider that not all innovations

197
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:12,093
can affect an infrastructure
that are necessarily generated

198
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:15,499
in the same sector, like you know,
think of what happened in

199
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:19,020
the battery technology, which
has starter in the energy sector

200
00:12:19,123 --> 00:12:21,911
but now has disrupted
impacts in the transportation

201
00:12:21,994 --> 00:12:24,206
infrastructure, thanks to
the introduction of

202
00:12:24,307 --> 00:12:26,119
the electric vehicles.

203
00:12:26,218 --> 00:12:29,755
Now, let me conclude this session
by using a simple diagram, which

204
00:12:29,859 --> 00:12:32,221
I call the "Transition Triangle".p

205
00:12:32,381 --> 00:12:35,706
As we discussed in this session,
it is very important to adopt

206
00:12:35,798 --> 00:12:39,885
a Holistic approach in management
and governance of transition towards

207
00:12:39,999 --> 00:12:44,724
the smart cities, considering
technological, economic, social

208
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:49,015
political, and environmental
dimensions of any change

209
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,451
that is going to be
introduced in the city

210
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:53,539
towards becoming more smart.

211
00:12:53,619 --> 00:12:56,757
We also have to have a long term
perspective in managing

212
00:12:56,857 --> 00:13:00,457
the transition towards the smart
cities, because we are dealing

213
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:03,569
with different kinds of past
dependencies in the system

214
00:13:03,748 --> 00:13:06,748
what we already see in
the S curve of innovation.

215
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,485
And last, but not least,
we have to keep as much

216
00:13:10,575 --> 00:13:14,300
flexibility as possible when
managing a transition process

217
00:13:14,403 --> 00:13:17,190
towards the smarter cities,
to effectively deal with

218
00:13:17,306 --> 00:13:20,356
the irreversible nature of
the changes that are introduced in

219
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:22,468
the socio-technical systems.

220
00:13:23,219 --> 00:13:28,419
But, following these guidelines is
easier said than done in practice.

221
00:13:28,517 --> 00:13:31,767
For example, it looks quite
paradoxical, you know at

222
00:13:31,857 --> 00:13:34,982
the first glance at least,
to have a long term perspective

223
00:13:35,128 --> 00:13:37,753
while staying flexible
at the same time.

224
00:13:37,939 --> 00:13:41,101
And this is why the next
sessions of this MOOC

225
00:13:41,226 --> 00:13:45,463
we'll try to get into more details
on how we can manage and

226
00:13:45,604 --> 00:13:48,604
govern the process of transition
towards the smart cities

227
00:13:48,747 --> 00:13:51,747
understood as complex
socio-technical systems.

228
00:13:51,904 --> 00:13:54,904
So, stay tuned.
