1
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,978
So, I'm Boi Faltings. 

2
00:00:07,149 --> 00:00:11,061
I'm professor of
artificial intelligence at the EPFL,

3
00:00:11,245 --> 00:00:15,383
and I would speak to you 
about concept of smart cities 

4
00:00:15,573 --> 00:00:19,461
and the use of artificial 
intelligence in that area. 

5
00:00:19,638 --> 00:00:22,438
So, one of the big features 
of smart cities is that 

6
00:00:22,613 --> 00:00:26,613
we will adjust parameters, 
we will control things 

7
00:00:26,836 --> 00:00:29,773
to sit as well being 
based on measurements 

8
00:00:29,992 --> 00:00:32,904
of what actually happens, 
what is the constraint of a city.

9
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:36,602
So naturally, smart cities 
will collect a lot of data. 

10
00:00:36,808 --> 00:00:40,283
Data in fact is at the heart 
of the concept of smart cities,

11
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:44,269
and so the question is, 
how do we gather this data

12
00:00:44,455 --> 00:00:45,981
and what do we do with it?

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:49,095
So, when we gather data, clearly
there's a lot of things 

14
00:00:49,292 --> 00:00:50,680
that can be done, 
for example, 

15
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:53,425
if we systematically analyze 
traffic data, 

16
00:00:53,655 --> 00:00:56,954
we can find out where 
do we have a lot of traffic jams,

17
00:00:57,166 --> 00:00:59,691
are there roads that are 
may be underutilized, 

18
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:02,611
could we somehow
channel traffic differently 

19
00:01:02,805 --> 00:01:05,393
so that we have less congestion. 

20
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,530
Could we maybe offer incentives
for people drive at different times,

21
00:01:09,734 --> 00:01:11,985
And all these things 
have been done 

22
00:01:12,186 --> 00:01:14,449
and they are very profitable
for the citizens 

23
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:17,046
and we can think of extending this.

24
00:01:17,227 --> 00:01:20,639
We could measure more data, 
we could measure more

25
00:01:20,836 --> 00:01:22,787
about what is happening 
in the city 

26
00:01:22,956 --> 00:01:27,494
and observe anomalies, and 
those anomalies could be corrected.

27
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:30,244
And so this is actually 
a very healthy development

28
00:01:30,456 --> 00:01:32,518
and it's going on already 
as we speak. 

29
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:35,001
But the real interest 
in the smart city,

30
00:01:35,207 --> 00:01:38,469
is not to just make 
small improvements, but may be 

31
00:01:38,674 --> 00:01:40,299
to have a permanent control loop.

32
00:01:40,541 --> 00:01:42,804
That is, where we observe 
what's happening,

33
00:01:42,998 --> 00:01:47,536
and we adjust, we make changes, 
and making changes is not easy 

34
00:01:47,733 --> 00:01:50,322
just based on data 
because the difficulty is 

35
00:01:50,534 --> 00:01:53,609
that we only have data 
about what is happening currently. 

36
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:57,967
So, we cannot tell from the fact 
that drivers produce traffic jams 

37
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:00,450
in certain situations, 
what will happen 

38
00:02:00,646 --> 00:02:03,621
if somehow flagged them
to take different routes

39
00:02:03,818 --> 00:02:07,356
or if we  scheduled 
the traffic lights differently?

40
00:02:07,566 --> 00:02:09,928
Well, you know, the data
doesn't tell us this,

41
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:12,459
so we cannot make 
that inference directly.

42
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,614
On the other hand, it is possible 
to do this by building simulations.

43
00:02:16,825 --> 00:02:21,525
And so, the next step in big data, 
and this is what actively 

44
00:02:21,702 --> 00:02:26,076
being researched now, is to actually
use it to build models. 

45
00:02:26,289 --> 00:02:28,964
So in the case of traffic again, 
we would build models 

46
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:31,779
of driver behaviors, 
how the drivers react 

47
00:02:31,956 --> 00:02:33,781
including their emotions.

48
00:02:34,002 --> 00:02:37,226
They get upset, they get frustrated,
you know, and so

49
00:02:37,417 --> 00:02:40,329
we can build increasingly 
sophisticated models   

50
00:02:40,517 --> 00:02:42,904
based on the data that 
we can gather today, 

51
00:02:43,116 --> 00:02:46,516
based on those observations, 
and then with both models

52
00:02:46,725 --> 00:02:49,950
we can simulate what will happen 
when we make changes 

53
00:02:50,759 --> 00:02:54,459
and that is actually 
a whole new game because now

54
00:02:54,646 --> 00:02:58,347
we can actually make 
more intelligent changes.

55
00:02:58,529 --> 00:03:01,429
Not just thinking what might 
be a good solution

56
00:03:01,615 --> 00:03:04,003
but actually having a pretty good 
prediction 

57
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:05,884
of what would be a good solution. 

58
00:03:06,064 --> 00:03:08,463
And then the next step
that will come afterwards 

59
00:03:08,658 --> 00:03:10,558
is to make the city 
really intelligent. 

60
00:03:10,748 --> 00:03:14,798
That is, to not leave this change 
to people, but to automate this, 

61
00:03:14,962 --> 00:03:17,524
and AI can really do this 
quite nicely.

62
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:19,556
we have developed 
lots of techniques

63
00:03:19,763 --> 00:03:22,563
for automated planning, 
for automated configuration

64
00:03:22,772 --> 00:03:25,722
for optimizing these kinds 
of situations. 

65
00:03:25,936 --> 00:03:29,086
So once we have the data, 
once we have those models, 

66
00:03:29,272 --> 00:03:33,447
actually Artificial Intelligence systems can also 
find us better solutions. 

67
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:38,009
So, I think there is
a bright future here.

68
00:03:38,867 --> 00:03:42,117
The more they data we collect, 
the more accurate this data is, 

69
00:03:42,297 --> 00:03:44,784
the better we can automatically act 

70
00:03:44,975 --> 00:03:48,000
and we can actually improve 
everybody's life,

71
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:50,675
and I think it will be 
quite important given that 

72
00:03:50,862 --> 00:03:54,337
we have a high density of people 
in cities, it's quite a challenge 

73
00:03:54,552 --> 00:03:57,039
to make life nice for them. 

74
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:02,817
Now, given all this, there are still
lots of difficulties to overcome

75
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:06,776
and the biggest difficulty really, 
is that data is biased. 

76
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:11,077
Most of the data we collect today
is collected opportunistically. 

77
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:15,292
That is, we take what we get, right.

78
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:18,967
We have sensors for traffic, 
we have sensors at traffic lights 

79
00:04:19,164 --> 00:04:21,588
so we kind of know 
how many cars are waiting 

80
00:04:21,816 --> 00:04:25,116
at certain one of these lights, 
so while that data is being sensed, 

81
00:04:25,334 --> 00:04:27,334
well, we might as well collect it. 

82
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:29,882
But we don't have data 
about roads.

83
00:04:30,063 --> 00:04:33,376
You know, we don't measure traffic 
on all the streets systematically, 

84
00:04:33,567 --> 00:04:35,180
so we have a lot of holes
in there. 

85
00:04:35,395 --> 00:04:38,857
And these holes actually are 
quite important because they mean 

86
00:04:39,031 --> 00:04:41,656
that the models are not quite 
as accurate

87
00:04:41,866 --> 00:04:43,503
 as we would like them to be. 

88
00:04:43,674 --> 00:04:46,536
So, take another example 
which is measuring pollution. 

89
00:04:46,749 --> 00:04:49,361
Air pollution kills according 
to an estimate 

90
00:04:49,547 --> 00:04:52,810
of the World Health organization, 
about 7 million people every year. 

91
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:56,465
Compare that to traffic accidents 
which the same organization 

92
00:04:56,676 --> 00:05:00,126
estimates to be responsible 
for 1.25 million deaths.

93
00:05:00,329 --> 00:05:03,829
So you see that air pollution 
actually is a much bigger problem. 

94
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:07,829
Now, we could help citizens 
if we could provide them

95
00:05:08,042 --> 00:05:11,580
 with some information in real time
because air pollution 

96
00:05:11,818 --> 00:05:15,131
that actually  kills people, 
is not the pollution that you see 

97
00:05:15,345 --> 00:05:18,470
when it's a bit fogy, or, you know,
the diesel exhaust 

98
00:05:18,662 --> 00:05:20,225
that comes out in front of you. 

99
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:23,653
These big particles actually get
ejected by your lungs right away.

100
00:05:23,889 --> 00:05:27,389
The thing that really kills people 
are things that you don't see,

101
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:31,902
gases that you don't smell
like carbon monoxide or NO2

102
00:05:32,108 --> 00:05:35,058
are fine particles that stay 
in your lungs

103
00:05:35,257 --> 00:05:37,220
and actually go 
into your bloodstreams, 

104
00:05:37,423 --> 00:05:39,435
these are things that you 
need to measure. 

105
00:05:39,646 --> 00:05:42,933
You cannot just see them, 
and in fact, it would be nice, 

106
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:47,208
if the citizens could have access 
to that data in real time.

107
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:51,095
I could avoid, for example, 
going jogging on a road 

108
00:05:51,318 --> 00:05:55,168
that's very polluted and actually 
absorbing a very large quantity 

109
00:05:55,359 --> 00:05:58,471
of this pollution, and I could do it
may be at another time 

110
00:05:58,685 --> 00:06:00,085
or in another place. 

111
00:06:00,249 --> 00:06:03,537
Now for a long time it was thought 
that pollution across the city 

112
00:06:03,723 --> 00:06:05,748
was relatively constant, 
so you know,

113
00:06:05,929 --> 00:06:09,066
you could just have one 
measuring point and it would work 

114
00:06:09,238 --> 00:06:11,451
and it would sort of, 
cover the whole city. 

115
00:06:11,646 --> 00:06:14,334
Today, people have developed 
better sensors 

116
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:17,127
and in fact, there are  a lot 
of small sensors available.

117
00:06:17,322 --> 00:06:20,247
Now, I have some pictures here, 
for example, 

118
00:06:20,444 --> 00:06:24,144
there's this, you know, 
there's a company called Plume Labs

119
00:06:24,355 --> 00:06:27,443
that make really small sensors 
like this that you could attach 

120
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:30,569
to your back pack, and you could 
walk around with them. 

121
00:06:30,783 --> 00:06:33,433
They're not supper accurate though
I must say. 

122
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:36,847
Then there's  another generation 
of laser based sensors, 

123
00:06:37,065 --> 00:06:39,390
so this is a sensor that is very 
popular in China 

124
00:06:39,591 --> 00:06:41,454
called the Laser Egg.

125
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,152
And they are quite cheap,
and they're quite accurate. 

126
00:06:45,342 --> 00:06:47,455
People can now measure 
this air pollution, 

127
00:06:47,656 --> 00:06:49,944
and people have walked around, 
for example, 

128
00:06:50,156 --> 00:06:52,668
this is the map of the city 
of Zurich.

129
00:06:52,897 --> 00:06:54,784
So people have walked around 

130
00:06:55,019 --> 00:06:57,869
with little bit more accurate 
sensors than this, actually,

131
00:06:58,093 --> 00:07:01,518
with the whole back pack full 
of sensors in the city of Zurich

132
00:07:01,731 --> 00:07:03,956
and they kind of measured 
more fine-grained 

133
00:07:04,178 --> 00:07:05,390
how the pollution looks. 

134
00:07:05,582 --> 00:07:08,107
And you can see that, 
you have very high pollution 

135
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:11,310
along certain main roads, 
and then, as you go away, 

136
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,716
sometimes within the space 
of 100 meters,

137
00:07:13,925 --> 00:07:17,612
the pollution is just half,
or sometimes even down to a quarter.

138
00:07:17,841 --> 00:07:21,178
So, they are pretty big differences,
and if I can choose, 

139
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:24,569
well, I could go to places where 
there's less pollution, right,

140
00:07:24,754 --> 00:07:28,691
or at least if I have a choice 
to my exercise or my bike riding. 

141
00:07:28,886 --> 00:07:32,348
In fact, a colleague of mine 
in Zurich has produced an App

142
00:07:32,534 --> 00:07:35,384
that allows you to minimize 
your pollution exposure, 

143
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:38,907
so you choose a bike route that 
minimizes your pollution exposure. 

144
00:07:39,818 --> 00:07:42,318
But, these things are 
all experimental.

145
00:07:42,525 --> 00:07:45,488
So for the moment, 
what we are really lacking 

146
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:48,589
is the data and to have the data 
systematically. 

147
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:52,843
The sensors are now 
becoming available but, you know, 

148
00:07:53,017 --> 00:07:55,030
we would have to put up 
a lot more of them

149
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:57,738
and we have to put them up
all over the city 

150
00:07:57,925 --> 00:08:02,375
in order to really provide 
this kind of map to the citizens. 

151
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:05,809
And so, how could this work?

152
00:08:05,967 --> 00:08:10,392
One way of course, is that the city
puts up all the sensors.

153
00:08:11,347 --> 00:08:14,397
So the city would buy hundreds 
of them may be,

154
00:08:14,571 --> 00:08:17,083
and they would ring on your door 
and they would say 

155
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:19,487
"Well, we should put a sensor 
in your backyard 

156
00:08:19,651 --> 00:08:22,651
because that's a good position. 
And so, could you please let us in?

157
00:08:22,841 --> 00:08:26,203
And by the way, we come by 
every month to do the maintenance 

158
00:08:26,410 --> 00:08:27,835
and make sure that it works."

159
00:08:28,057 --> 00:08:30,144
So that's obviously not 
the greatest model. 

160
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,307
So, we can think of new ways
of doing this, and one new way

161
00:08:35,504 --> 00:08:38,617
that we have been promoting a lot 
is crowd sensing. 

162
00:08:38,828 --> 00:08:42,503
Which means that, just like people 
can buy solar panels today, 

163
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:45,205
and actually sell 
the electricity back, 

164
00:08:45,435 --> 00:08:48,135
people could buy sensors 
and sell the data, right? 

165
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:53,463
And that way, may be even lot's 
of people would be quite motivated

166
00:08:53,673 --> 00:08:55,948
to have these sensors 
close to their home

167
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:58,968
because it would give them 
some information about the pollution

168
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:03,290
they're currently exposed to, 
but also if they sell this data, 

169
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:06,783
well they could recover the cost 
of the sensor, so.

170
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:09,158
This would probably give 
quite a movement

171
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:13,015
and  it could also support 
a little bit more democratic use 

172
00:09:13,221 --> 00:09:15,909
of this data because everybody 
could contribute 

173
00:09:16,119 --> 00:09:18,144
and everybody could see the effect.

174
00:09:18,338 --> 00:09:20,650
There would be no trust issue, 
in the sense that, 

175
00:09:20,835 --> 00:09:24,110
people would have to trust 
that the government does not hide 

176
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:26,031
any important pollution from them. 

177
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,417
So, I think it's really 
the way to go. 

178
00:09:28,623 --> 00:09:31,398
Now of course if I tell you, 
"I will pay you for data,"

179
00:09:31,624 --> 00:09:34,424
Well, you'll say, "Great, you know, 
I don't even have to buy the sensor,

180
00:09:34,653 --> 00:09:38,528
I will get a random number generator
and I will feed in some data, 

181
00:09:38,742 --> 00:09:41,954
so we have to think carefully 
about how we pay for data.

182
00:09:42,195 --> 00:09:45,195
And this is one innovation 
I'd like to show you

183
00:09:45,867 --> 00:09:48,667
that we have been working on
in the lab 

184
00:09:48,824 --> 00:09:54,312
where we actually have a scheme 
for rewarding 

185
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:58,377
such that people who have 
no extra data to report 

186
00:09:58,572 --> 00:10:00,335
don't get any reward. 

187
00:10:00,562 --> 00:10:04,362
And the way it woks is that, 
you have your space, 

188
00:10:04,572 --> 00:10:07,047
so this would be a part 
of a city, for example. 

189
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:09,955
Actually, this was a real experiment
we did, with data

190
00:10:10,156 --> 00:10:12,069
from the City of Strasbourg
in France. 

191
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:15,701
So these are all measuring points, 
the red crosses you can see here ,

192
00:10:15,893 --> 00:10:19,043
and let's say we have 
participants here who says, 

193
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,415
"Okay, I have this data 
to sell you."

194
00:10:21,626 --> 00:10:24,514
And so it provides, 
this participant provides us 

195
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:28,657
with some kind of reading 
of sensors, supposedly. 

196
00:10:28,877 --> 00:10:32,127
Then what we do is we identify 
in the neighborhood 

197
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:35,736
other sensors that have give us data
that have  to be correlated to this,

198
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:38,557
right, at least the fluctuations 
will be correlating 

199
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:41,837
and so, this is what we call peers. 

200
00:10:42,065 --> 00:10:47,553
And we will compare this participant
report to the peer reports, right,

201
00:10:47,717 --> 00:10:50,942
and all that we'll require is that 
it should be more 

202
00:10:51,104 --> 00:10:55,129
closely correlated to the 
peer reports than to overall average

203
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:57,490
that we find in the rest 
of the city. 

204
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,541
And it turns out that this 
correlation actually is enough 

205
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:04,201
to have a scheme so that somebody 
who has no data to report 

206
00:11:04,406 --> 00:11:08,469
or who just reports randomly, 
can expect exactly no revenue 

207
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:12,285
and everybody who actually 
accurate data 

208
00:11:12,468 --> 00:11:14,393
and the more accurate, 
the better, 

209
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:16,714
actually can expect 
a higher revenue. 

210
00:11:16,906 --> 00:11:19,681
So we have here for these points
 that you see,

211
00:11:19,923 --> 00:11:23,185
we have an image here 
that show you 

212
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:27,256
all the different census, they were 
116 of them of the stimulation here 

213
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:29,717
and so these are actual data that 
was measured 

214
00:11:29,881 --> 00:11:31,956
in the City of Strasbourg
where we made a simulation 

215
00:11:32,189 --> 00:11:34,452
of whether you would report 
correctly or not 

216
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,350
and how it would be rewarded, 
and you can see here 

217
00:11:37,564 --> 00:11:41,402
that census would report, honestly, 
this would be the blue curve, right.

218
00:11:41,629 --> 00:11:45,966
They always get a positive payoff. 

219
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:49,604
Whereas those that report randomly,
so these red curves here,

220
00:11:49,811 --> 00:11:52,111
they often get negative payoffs. 

221
00:11:52,307 --> 00:11:55,507
Note, average actually the payoff
is pretty much exactly zero. 

222
00:11:55,686 --> 00:11:58,648
And also every census, 
every single one of them, 

223
00:11:58,859 --> 00:12:02,297
gets a higher payoff 
and a significantly higher payoff 

224
00:12:02,512 --> 00:12:06,275
by reporting truthfully, 
and reporting accurately. 

225
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:11,759
So we think this scheme really 
will enable a smart city 

226
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:16,708
to actually have all the data 
and to make it available to citizens

227
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,441
and to make it available 
for decisions, for example, 

228
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:22,784
If we discover that pollution 
is too high on certain roads,

229
00:12:22,976 --> 00:12:25,601
then maybe we will run the buses
somewhere else, 

230
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:28,555
maybe we will stop car traffic 
into the city.

231
00:12:28,773 --> 00:12:31,823
So all these measures can be coupled
to a real time measurement 

232
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:34,863
rather than, well, 
some bureaucratic decisions 

233
00:12:35,025 --> 00:12:37,550
or decisions that maybe 
people won't support. 

234
00:12:37,759 --> 00:12:40,259
I think if we have this kind 
of democratic movement 

235
00:12:40,452 --> 00:12:42,640
where everybody can 
contribute their data.

236
00:12:42,852 --> 00:12:45,777
So if they think that my area 
is too polluted 

237
00:12:45,984 --> 00:12:49,172
and there are too many cars going 
through, well, put up more census

238
00:12:49,379 --> 00:12:51,792
and you will show this to the city 

239
00:12:51,971 --> 00:12:55,771
and in fact, you can also expect 
some measures to be taken

240
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,720
if pollution is really too high.

241
00:12:57,932 --> 00:13:01,120
So, we think that could be a 
new model and we're actually looking

242
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:04,246
together with this company 
at Beijing, that makes sense

243
00:13:04,446 --> 00:13:07,446
whether we can work this out 
in the near future.

244
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,112
All these things take time 
as you can imagine

245
00:13:10,302 --> 00:13:13,565
but I hope that maybe we can
inspire you as well, 

246
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:15,817
to think of some of 
these techniques.

247
00:13:16,008 --> 00:13:19,946
Thank you very much for listening 
and I wish you a good day.
