00:00:06,127 --> 00:00:10,039
So far we have talked to you about
the transition of cities as

2
00:00:10,242 --> 00:00:15,117
sociotechnical systems. We have
talked about the importance of

3
00:00:15,321 --> 00:00:18,946
the digital layer in that transition
and you have heard

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,453
from various experts about
elements of that digital layer.

5
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:30,156
Now let us briefly come back
to the question of sequencing.

6
00:00:30,387 --> 00:00:34,062
There have been raised a series
of questions that need to be

7
00:00:34,244 --> 00:00:38,194
addressed for the
digital layer to function properly

8
00:00:38,413 --> 00:00:40,688
and here these
questions are again.

9
00:00:41,996 --> 00:00:46,458
While these questions all need to
be addressed at some point,

10
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:52,145
the sequencing of how they're
addressed may vary from city to city.

11
00:00:52,357 --> 00:00:57,095
What we can say is that some
questions ideally should be

12
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:02,715
addressed at the industry level;
like questions of standards typically.

13
00:01:02,962 --> 00:01:07,099
If they are not addressed at the
industry level then probably

14
00:01:07,286 --> 00:01:10,548
they will be addressed at the
national level or

15
00:01:10,732 --> 00:01:13,407
at the super-national level.
In the case of Europe,

16
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,763
this would typically be the EU.
There are a series of questions

17
00:01:18,962 --> 00:01:22,187
which can or should be
addressed at the city level;

18
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:27,347
like questions of location of the
data, like questions of ownership,

19
00:01:27,569 --> 00:01:32,144
questions of transparency
and accuracy of the data.

20
00:01:32,666 --> 00:01:36,378
Now that we have seen what it
takes to transit to Smart Cities

21
00:01:36,598 --> 00:01:40,348
in terms of getting the data
or the digital layer right,

22
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,250
and now that we have seen what
can be obtained from these data

23
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,464
from the presentation
of Professor Faltings.

24
00:01:48,935 --> 00:01:52,410
let us now turn to the services
and challenges that

25
00:01:52,594 --> 00:01:57,582
a transition to Smart Cities
raises for the services layer.
