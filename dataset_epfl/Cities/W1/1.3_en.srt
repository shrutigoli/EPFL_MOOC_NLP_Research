1
00:00:05,237 --> 00:00:07,225
Welcome back to the course. 

2
00:00:07,412 --> 00:00:11,750
In this session we will talk 
about digitization.

3
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,600
What is it exactly?

4
00:00:13,887 --> 00:00:18,912
We have structured this 
session into 4 segments. 

5
00:00:19,112 --> 00:00:22,236
First we will talk about data
generation and storage, then

6
00:00:22,324 --> 00:00:25,187
about communications and Networks,

7
00:00:25,387 --> 00:00:28,499
then we will talk briefly about
Internet of Things 

8
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:32,370
and finally we will talk about 
analytics, data analytics. 

9
00:00:32,985 --> 00:00:36,298
So let us start with data generation,

10
00:00:37,257 --> 00:00:39,006
as I am sure you have observed,

11
00:00:39,082 --> 00:00:43,257
data is generated from a growing
amount of sources. 

12
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:48,852
Cameras, sensors, RFIDs, GPS,

13
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:53,740
including what we call self-generation,
that is the smart phones that you

14
00:00:53,815 --> 00:00:58,628
are using are constantly generating
and transmitting data

15
00:00:58,828 --> 00:01:02,941
and all this data is generated 
at an ever lower cost

16
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:05,766
and by ever smaller devices. 

17
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:11,362
and also the storage capacity where
this data can be stored

18
00:01:11,612 --> 00:01:14,612
is increasing exponentially. 

19
00:01:15,312 --> 00:01:19,950
Basically all this leads to the fact
that there is an unprecedented

20
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:23,875
ever growing amount of data
that is being generated. 

21
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:28,776
So that's the first element of 
digitization.

22
00:01:29,889 --> 00:01:34,489
The second element is what we call
communication and networks 

23
00:01:34,564 --> 00:01:38,651
and that has 3 different dimensions
that all relate to each other.

24
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:45,441
On the most basic level we have the
telecommunications infrastructures. 

25
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:50,991
Traditionally these are the wired 
infrastructures, the cables, the fibre

26
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,797
but increasingly we have 
wireless infrastructures also

27
00:01:56,860 --> 00:02:01,198
where the capacity is increasing 

28
00:02:01,398 --> 00:02:07,448
1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, WiMax, 
WiFi, satellites.

29
00:02:07,648 --> 00:02:11,848
All this makes up for the 
telecommunications infrastructures

30
00:02:12,023 --> 00:02:15,148
through which data is transmitted. 

31
00:02:15,348 --> 00:02:23,097
The 2nd dimension is the networks, 
that is the different devices that

32
00:02:23,185 --> 00:02:27,648
are being used need to be 
connected  to each other

33
00:02:27,848 --> 00:02:32,398
through the telecommunications 
infrastructure and this is done

34
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:38,547
by so called protocols, physically
connecting the different

35
00:02:38,648 --> 00:02:44,435
data storing devices to each other

36
00:02:45,054 --> 00:02:47,629
and the 3rd dimension of this

37
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:51,991
is the identification and
exchange of this data.

38
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:57,891
What is typically being called the
World Wide Web, that is the location

39
00:02:58,091 --> 00:03:07,091
of this data by way of unique record
locators inside the different

40
00:03:07,154 --> 00:03:10,291
devices, inside the 
different computers. 

41
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:15,266
So adding to the data generation,
this second dimension, 

42
00:03:15,454 --> 00:03:21,066
the communication dimension,
connects all the data to each other.

43
00:03:21,758 --> 00:03:27,995
So we have basically 4 things, we have
a telecommunications infrastructure,

44
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:33,810
we have the network, that is
the devices connected to each other 

45
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,510
through the internet, 

46
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:43,884
and then we have the identification 
and exchange of the different data

47
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:46,922
of the devices connected 
to each other

48
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:49,097
thanks to the World Wide Web

49
00:03:49,198 --> 00:03:52,948
and, as we have seen in the very
beginning, we have the data

50
00:03:53,048 --> 00:03:55,085
generation and storage. 

51
00:03:56,186 --> 00:04:00,410
Now all this has a growing capacity,

52
00:04:00,486 --> 00:04:07,123
there are more and more things that
can be stored, generated, transmitted,

53
00:04:07,261 --> 00:04:15,411
it has increasing speed, data is
transmitted ever more rapidly,

54
00:04:15,611 --> 00:04:20,548
there are reduced power needs, even
to the point that some of the

55
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:26,136
devices do not need power
anymore such as RFID's,

56
00:04:26,336 --> 00:04:29,499
all this at an every lower cost

57
00:04:29,674 --> 00:04:34,674
and in an ever smaller format,
miniaturized.  

58
00:04:34,861 --> 00:04:39,849
Today you can have, for example,
RFID's directly in each letter

59
00:04:40,049 --> 00:04:43,049
in a cost effective manner. 

60
00:04:44,363 --> 00:04:50,338
Now all this together leads to what
is currently being called 

61
00:04:50,501 --> 00:04:52,101
the Internet of Things.

62
00:04:52,276 --> 00:04:58,151
That is the different devices
connected to each other,

63
00:04:58,351 --> 00:05:01,351
thanks to the Internet and the
World Wide Web

64
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:06,518
and this has 3 main dimensions.

65
00:05:06,684 --> 00:05:12,384
So we have exponentially 
connected devices,

66
00:05:13,322 --> 00:05:19,859
people say that in about 5 years,
the amount of devices that will be

67
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:23,721
connected to each other through
the internet will double

68
00:05:24,258 --> 00:05:29,283
then we have exponentially generated
and transmitted data.

69
00:05:29,741 --> 00:05:36,304
Again, for example, people say that
in a house in 5 years, 

70
00:05:36,454 --> 00:05:41,616
the bandwidth that will be used by
these devices connected to each other

71
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:47,429
through the internet will take up
50% of all the bandwidth

72
00:05:47,629 --> 00:05:53,066
and then we have increasingly
real time exchange of data. 

73
00:05:53,266 --> 00:06:00,516
Already today, you can supervise
your house remotely though your

74
00:06:00,629 --> 00:06:08,191
smart phone in real time, all this
together is leading to this

75
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:12,491
phenomenon we call the Internet
of Things today. 

76
00:06:14,034 --> 00:06:19,384
Now there is an additional element
that we need to talk about

77
00:06:19,497 --> 00:06:21,497
and this is analytics.

78
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:28,418
All this data needs to be analysed
and also here, there is a rapid 

79
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:33,255
development in the ability and
the capacity to analyse

80
00:06:33,405 --> 00:06:35,405
and also to visualise these. 

81
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:37,692
The visualisation is
necessary because

82
00:06:37,793 --> 00:06:44,268
analytics often cannot really show
what the outcome is so the things here

83
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:49,755
that are important are what we all
artificial intelligence,

84
00:06:49,868 --> 00:06:56,242
machine learning, deep learning
tools that basically allow for the 

85
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:01,555
intelligent analysis of all these
huge amounts of data. 

86
00:07:02,897 --> 00:07:06,209
This has also been called today
Big Data. 

87
00:07:06,829 --> 00:07:07,592
Now.

88
00:07:09,193 --> 00:07:14,381
In our MOOC here, the combination
of all these things, 

89
00:07:14,518 --> 00:07:21,006
the storage, the transmission, the
networks and the analytics is

90
00:07:21,118 --> 00:07:23,656
what we call digitization. 

91
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:28,331
It is important to stress that it
is the combination of these things

92
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:31,568
that makes up for the digitization,

93
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:38,320
and this digitalisation, as we will
see, in the next session has the 

94
00:07:38,396 --> 00:07:42,083
disruptive effect on
absolutely everything 

95
00:07:42,333 --> 00:07:46,808
and it also has in the session
after, as we will see, disruptive

96
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:48,696
effects on cities. 

97
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,146
So stay tuned to the next sessions.
