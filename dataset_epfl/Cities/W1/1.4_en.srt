00:00:05,158 --> 00:00:08,308
Welcome back.
In the previous session

2
00:00:08,514 --> 00:00:12,838
we talked about digitalization;
what it is.

3
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:17,152
Now in this session, we will talk
about the implications

4
00:00:17,374 --> 00:00:22,148
of digitalization. First in general
on industries

5
00:00:22,368 --> 00:00:25,593
and then on
urban infrastructures.

6
00:00:26,851 --> 00:00:30,413
So let's first start
with the industries.

7
00:00:31,502 --> 00:00:36,203
Traditionally, in any industry
you have a production chain;

8
00:00:36,396 --> 00:00:42,321
a physical value chain.
Take a car whereby it is

9
00:00:42,592 --> 00:00:49,166
assembled at different stages and
ultimately sold to a customer.

10
00:00:49,537 --> 00:00:54,562
The customer is connected to the
final element of the value chain

11
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,780
which is the retailer
in this case.

12
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:04,652
What changes with digitalization is
the fact that you are able to

13
00:01:04,882 --> 00:01:08,870
mirror this physical value chain
in a data layer.

14
00:01:09,074 --> 00:01:13,912
All the information that is contained
in the physical value chain

15
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:19,543
is now so to speak, duplicated,
replicated at the digital layer.

16
00:01:19,757 --> 00:01:23,994
The physical layer, the
physical value chain still exists;

17
00:01:24,176 --> 00:01:29,539
continues to produce cars until
the end-consumer/customer

18
00:01:29,747 --> 00:01:37,823
but the information about the whole
process is now, so to speak

19
00:01:39,512 --> 00:01:48,224
in a digital value chain and the
customer can now connect directly.

20
00:01:48,438 --> 00:01:54,163
He can order the car on the internet.
He can assemble the car himself.

21
00:01:54,403 --> 00:01:59,616
He can follow how the things have
been produced along the stages;

22
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,044
what materials have been used,
all this so the customer,

23
00:02:05,292 --> 00:02:11,166
the interface with the customer
now becomes a digital interface.

24
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,420
Think for example on Dell computers
which you buy on the internet

25
00:02:16,608 --> 00:02:19,933
and you assemble yourself
on the internet.

26
00:02:20,165 --> 00:02:25,777
That is the first stage.
The second stage is the fact that

27
00:02:25,982 --> 00:02:32,494
the information that are contained
in that data layer can be used

28
00:02:32,728 --> 00:02:39,453
to produce new services, new business
models and have new customers or

29
00:02:39,686 --> 00:02:46,574
the same customers. Think about the
Amazon example: the first layer

30
00:02:46,822 --> 00:02:51,021
would be that you order your book
digitally. It's still produced.

31
00:02:51,243 --> 00:02:56,755
It still arrives physically and the
second layer would be that you,

32
00:02:56,966 --> 00:03:04,065
as a customer are being offered
advice as to other people who bought

33
00:03:04,286 --> 00:03:10,474
similar books. What other offers can
be made to you and how you could

34
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:17,946
actually profit from the data that
are contained in that digital layer.

35
00:03:18,348 --> 00:03:22,823
There are new services and there are
new business models. This is a

36
00:03:23,028 --> 00:03:29,365
value added on top of the
traditional, physical value chain.

37
00:03:30,978 --> 00:03:35,428
There are many industries that
are affected by the actual -

38
00:03:35,635 --> 00:03:42,059
Potentially all the industries can
be affected by this evolution.

39
00:03:42,911 --> 00:03:49,349
I have put a list here of potential
industries that can be affected

40
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:53,787
by this mirroring and
by this digitalization.

41
00:03:54,056 --> 00:04:00,655
What are these? Those are the ones
that are particularly information

42
00:04:00,863 --> 00:04:07,663
intensive. For example, education
or health care where a lot

43
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:13,292
of information is contained; is
known by the doctors or the teachers

44
00:04:13,502 --> 00:04:18,877
and mirroring these information
on a digital layer and

45
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:25,706
repackaging them to sell to the
customers has a huge, a huge

46
00:04:25,918 --> 00:04:29,043
disruptive effect on
these industries.

47
00:04:29,387 --> 00:04:35,636
Other examples are non-scalable
industries. A typical example here is

48
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,627
the taxi industry which has been
disrupted by Uber, to take

49
00:04:39,838 --> 00:04:45,225
just an example. The industry is
really not scalable. It's at the 

50
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:49,059
urban level or it's even at the taxi
level but aggregating

51
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:55,021
this information and creating new
services out of it really disrupts

52
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:58,961
the traditional industry.
Other industries that are

53
00:04:59,166 --> 00:05:03,278
particularly vulnerable to 
digitalization are highly

54
00:05:03,518 --> 00:05:06,768
fragmented industries; typically
the logistics industries

55
00:05:07,037 --> 00:05:11,674
with a lot of players in it will
be particularly affected

56
00:05:11,886 --> 00:05:15,148
by this digitalization whereby
the information can be

57
00:05:15,376 --> 00:05:22,214
aggregated and sort of condensed
and repackaged to the customer.

58
00:05:22,438 --> 00:05:26,876
Finally there are also the
information assymetric industries.

59
00:05:27,504 --> 00:05:32,991
Again, health care where the doctor
knows a lot more than you do

60
00:05:33,225 --> 00:05:39,088
or government services and the
duplication, the mirroring of this

61
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:45,624
information empowers the customer
who now also can become some sort of

62
00:05:45,878 --> 00:05:52,590
a prosumer, delivering information
himself into that digital layer

63
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:56,826
which again can be used
for new services.

64
00:05:57,482 --> 00:06:03,282
This is the overall effect of
digitalization on, let's say

65
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:09,740
the traditional industry. Potentially
any, any activity that has a 

66
00:06:09,958 --> 00:06:16,208
value chain can be disrupted by
digitalization but some are

67
00:06:16,426 --> 00:06:18,738
more vulnerable than others.

68
00:06:18,951 --> 00:06:24,539
Now lets look at what that does to
cities and urban infrastructures.

69
00:06:25,245 --> 00:06:28,495
The distinction we made in our
previous MOOC which is

70
00:06:28,734 --> 00:06:32,959
the classical distinction between
the infrastructures and the services

71
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,935
that are provided on the
infrastructure. A road

72
00:06:36,142 --> 00:06:39,580
and a transportation service 
on the basis of the road.

73
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,922
The customer, the citizen is
connected to the service,

74
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:47,003
not directly to the infrastructure.

75
00:06:47,256 --> 00:06:51,381
What happens with digitalization
is the fact that

76
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:55,764
we introduce a data,
a digital layer in between

77
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,885
the infrastructure and the service
in exactly the same way

78
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:03,065
as I have shown
in the previous slide.

79
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:08,528
This does 2 things similar to what
I said before:

80
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:16,880
First, it sort of helps to manage
the infrastructures more efficiently.

81
00:07:17,113 --> 00:07:25,050
It leads to an optimized physical
value chain by the very fact

82
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:29,081
that you know that you
have information about this

83
00:07:29,302 --> 00:07:34,002
value chain. You have smarter energy
management thanks to this

84
00:07:34,216 --> 00:07:38,654
digital layers, smarter transport
management, smarter waste

85
00:07:38,878 --> 00:07:45,365
management and this is typically
what is happening

86
00:07:45,571 --> 00:07:51,196
in smart cities. The second element
is the new types of

87
00:07:51,412 --> 00:07:57,437
services that can be provided
thanks to that digital layer,

88
00:07:57,649 --> 00:08:01,936
thanks to that data layer.
Smart new services,

89
00:08:02,412 --> 00:08:09,024
new business models that can emerge.
The city can advise you or

90
00:08:09,231 --> 00:08:14,206
the energy company can advise you
about your behaviour,

91
00:08:14,601 --> 00:08:21,889
about saving energy, offering you
new types of services;

92
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:27,358
combining even infrastructures.
Your behaviour; let's say you have

93
00:08:27,562 --> 00:08:32,412
an electric car and your mobility
behaviour combined with

94
00:08:32,627 --> 00:08:39,102
your energy behaviour.
Let's look at that again in terms of

95
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:45,496
what that means for smart city:
The first dimension, the 

96
00:08:45,732 --> 00:08:49,557
smart infrastructure management
leads to what we call

97
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:54,038
City 1 plus something. 
It is basically a process

98
00:08:54,249 --> 00:09:00,649
of optimization, of incremental
innovation, of improving

99
00:09:00,878 --> 00:09:08,316
the existing systems thanks to the
digital layer.

100
00:09:08,628 --> 00:09:14,928
The second dimension which we then
call City 2.0 is really

101
00:09:15,149 --> 00:09:18,862
the disruptive changes, the
qualitative changes.

102
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:24,926
No longer the incremental changes by
offering new types of services

103
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:29,955
thanks to the digital layer;
energy service, transport service

104
00:09:31,718 --> 00:09:37,030
let's say waste services, green
services, all these kind of things.

105
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:44,444
The smart city has to be looked at
really in terms of these 2 things:

106
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:49,875
1) the incremental innovation on
optimizing the infrastructure

107
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:55,357
thanks to the digital layer and
2) the qualitative change in the

108
00:09:55,860 --> 00:10:00,223
services, in even the business
models for the services.

109
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:03,989
We will go into more details
later on but I think

110
00:10:04,227 --> 00:10:09,115
this is a good description
of the 2 types of things

111
00:10:09,469 --> 00:10:11,869
the smart city
actually brings.

112
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,746
Stay tuned.
