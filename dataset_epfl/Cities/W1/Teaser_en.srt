1
00:00:05,512 --> 00:00:08,174
We all know that cities
are not efficient,

2
00:00:08,374 --> 00:00:10,900
think for example of congestion.

3
00:00:11,362 --> 00:00:14,137
We also know that cities
are not sustainable,

4
00:00:14,225 --> 00:00:16,175
think of all the energy wasted

5
00:00:16,673 --> 00:00:19,535
and we know that cities
are not resilient.

6
00:00:19,648 --> 00:00:23,536
Think for example of all the
different natural hazards.

7
00:00:24,296 --> 00:00:28,221
Now addressing these challenges
becomes even more important

8
00:00:28,421 --> 00:00:33,159
because of rapid population growth
and global warming, for example.

9
00:00:34,024 --> 00:00:36,824
Infrastructures are the
backbone of cities

10
00:00:37,061 --> 00:00:41,799
and they do play a crucial role
in addressing these challenges.

11
00:00:41,911 --> 00:00:46,024
Over the past few years, technology
is capable in addressing at least

12
00:00:46,086 --> 00:00:49,036
some of these challenges
that are rapidly spreading.

13
00:00:49,604 --> 00:00:52,879
This is especially the case of the
information and communication

14
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:56,616
technologies currently being
developed by universities,

15
00:00:56,704 --> 00:01:01,191
technology providers, technology
start ups and many more.

16
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:06,525
Cameras, sensors and other data
collecting devices are producing

17
00:01:06,549 --> 00:01:09,074
unprecedented amounts of data.

18
00:01:09,487 --> 00:01:14,112
For example, data about movements
of vehicles and mobility behavior

19
00:01:14,224 --> 00:01:17,299
or data about energy
and water consumption

20
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:19,637
by individuals and buildings.

21
00:01:20,426 --> 00:01:24,851
From this data smart mobility,
smart energy, smart buildings

22
00:01:24,892 --> 00:01:28,367
and many other smart
infrastructures can emerge

23
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,030
and ultimately,  this could lead to
what is now called a Smart City

24
00:01:34,279 --> 00:01:38,367
but we know that technology alone
is not going to solve the complex

25
00:01:38,432 --> 00:01:39,794
problems of cities

26
00:01:40,428 --> 00:01:43,815
and our Smart City MOOC is
precisely about that

27
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:47,792
that is how to make use of
digitalization for addressing 

28
00:01:47,834 --> 00:01:50,959
the big challenges to create
Smart Cities. 

29
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:55,491
More precisely our course is about
the management and the governance

30
00:01:55,545 --> 00:02:00,195
of Smart Cities as well as of the
transition towards Smart Cities. 

31
00:02:00,637 --> 00:02:04,512
Our course will be structured
into 5 blocks or 5 weeks 

32
00:02:04,528 --> 00:02:07,128
along the following structure.

33
00:02:07,301 --> 00:02:11,188
First there will be an introduction
to the concept of Smart Cities

34
00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:17,296
then we will talk about example of
Smart Urban Energy Systems.

35
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:22,748
The 3rd week will be about the example
of Smart Urban Mobility Systems

36
00:02:23,389 --> 00:02:29,139
and the last 2 weeks are about managing
the transition towards Smart Cities.

37
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:34,754
In this MOOC, you will hear lectures
from myself and colleagues.

38
00:02:34,883 --> 00:02:39,546
In addition, we will have interviews
with experts from industry.

39
00:02:40,681 --> 00:02:44,243
My name is Matthias Finger and
I'm a professor of Management

40
00:02:44,285 --> 00:02:47,241
of Network Industries at Ecole
Polytechnique Fédérale 

41
00:02:47,266 --> 00:02:48,954
 de Lausanne, Switzerland.

42
00:02:49,889 --> 00:02:54,551
It will be my pleasure to lead you
through this course on Smart Cities.

43
00:02:55,805 --> 00:02:59,393
This MOOC is one of
the outcomes of IGLUS

44
00:02:59,799 --> 00:03:04,486
which is an action research
project involving selected cities,

45
00:03:04,755 --> 00:03:07,755
international organizations
and firms.

46
00:03:09,236 --> 00:03:12,536
You may already have followed
our previous course entitled

47
00:03:12,598 --> 00:03:15,273
Management of Urban Infrastructure.

48
00:03:15,588 --> 00:03:20,338
In this course, we still talk about
Managing Urban Infrastructures

49
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:24,189
but now we have a special
focus on the information

50
00:03:24,208 --> 00:03:26,508
and communication technologies

51
00:03:26,906 --> 00:03:31,894
and these technologies totally change
the way these infrastructures are

52
00:03:31,927 --> 00:03:33,764
managed and governed.

53
00:03:33,974 --> 00:03:36,186
This is what we call Smart Cities.

54
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,408
Come and explore this new reality
and join us in this course.
