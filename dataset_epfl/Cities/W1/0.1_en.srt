00:00:05,626 --> 00:00:08,776
Hello and welcome to our
Smart City MOOC.

2
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:12,475
My name is Matthias Finger, I'm a
professor of Management of

3
00:00:12,551 --> 00:00:16,163
Network Industries at EPFL in
Switzerland. 

4
00:00:17,778 --> 00:00:22,540
As you all know, cities are the new
relevant entities in the world. 

5
00:00:22,603 --> 00:00:26,590
Economically relevant, socially
relevant, ecologically relevant,

6
00:00:26,665 --> 00:00:30,214
increasingly politically 
relevant and, of course, 

7
00:00:30,303 --> 00:00:33,265
since long, culturally relevant. 

8
00:00:34,443 --> 00:00:39,393
The urban infrastructures are the
very backbone of these cities

9
00:00:40,535 --> 00:00:45,585
and in the previous MOOC, which you
may have seen, we have talked about

10
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:47,860
a series of key topics. 

11
00:00:48,273 --> 00:00:53,060
Namely, first, the distinction
between the infrastructures and the

12
00:00:53,223 --> 00:00:57,760
services that are being provided on 
the basis of infrastructures,

13
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,147
then we have talked about
the performance of urban 

14
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:03,373
infrastructure systems. 

15
00:01:04,123 --> 00:01:09,785
And then we have explained the 
processes of planning, maintaining

16
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:13,085
and operating urban infrastructures. 

17
00:01:14,158 --> 00:01:18,845
We have also briefly mentioned the
emerging role of the information

18
00:01:18,908 --> 00:01:21,245
and communication technologies. 

19
00:01:21,677 --> 00:01:25,389
Something which has become known
as Smart City. 

20
00:01:27,077 --> 00:01:33,464
Now in this MOOC, we will talk about
the impact of the information and

21
00:01:33,539 --> 00:01:36,564
communication technologies on the
urban infrastructures. 

22
00:01:37,502 --> 00:01:42,739
And the important managerial and
governments considerations which are

23
00:01:42,802 --> 00:01:48,202
necessary to unleash the potential
of these ICT's for Smart Cities

24
00:01:48,701 --> 00:01:52,251
and we will do that in 5 separate weeks.

25
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,355
In the first week, we will offer an
understanding of Smart Cities.

26
00:01:57,942 --> 00:02:04,092
then in week 2 and week 3, we will
talk about smart urban energy systems

27
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:07,505
and smart urban 
transportation systems.

28
00:02:08,177 --> 00:02:13,327
Week 4 and 5 are dedicated
to the question of transiting

29
00:02:13,482 --> 00:02:15,569
towards Smart Cities. 

30
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:20,829
In order to complete the course, 
please watch the videos. 

31
00:02:21,298 --> 00:02:25,922
There are also complementary
readings that explain the various 

32
00:02:25,987 --> 00:02:27,787
aspects of the course. 

33
00:02:28,545 --> 00:02:32,807
There are quizzes that have to be
taken and at the end of the course 

34
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,911
there is a final exam. 

35
00:02:35,315 --> 00:02:39,652
You also have the opportunity to
write an optional case

36
00:02:40,261 --> 00:02:43,598
which gives you the possibility to
win a prize. 

37
00:02:44,401 --> 00:02:47,401
I hope you will enjoy the
course and stay tuned.
