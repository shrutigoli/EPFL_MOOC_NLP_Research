Welcome to the 1st week of our
Smart Cities MOOC. 
I'm sure you have asked yourself whether Smart Cities is a hype or a reality, or both. and that is what this first week is all about, that is understanding what Smart Cities really are. 
Now you can expect the following outcomes from this 1st week. 
First we will talk about thinking Smart
Cities, how to think Smart Cities. then we will offer a conceptualization of Smart Cities and thirdly, we will detail exactly the impact that digitization has on cities, making them Smart Cities. and finally, we will look at the implications of all of this for management and governance of cities or Smart Cities. 
Now from our previous MOOC, we take this basic distinction between infrastructures or an infrastructure layer and services or a services layer. 
It is on the basis of infrastructures like water pipes that water services, infrastructure services are being provided to customers and citizens. 
What is new is really this digital layer that comes in between infrastructures and services and this changes everything. 
Now the 1st week is structured into 6 different sessions.
In the 1st session, we will present our conceptualization of cities as socio-technical systems.
This is necessary because only on the basis of this conceptualization, can we really understand the concept of Smart Cities. 
In the 2nd session, we will look at digitization. 
What is it exactly?
In the 3rd session, we will look at the general implications that such digitization has on society, on industries. 
In the 4th session, we will look, in particular, at the implications of digitization on the cities. and then we will show that there are actually 2 different perspectives one can have on Smart Cities. 
Finally we will hear from one of the leading cities in the world that has pioneered the transition to
Smart Cities. 
So, let us move to the 1st session now talking about socio-technical systems
