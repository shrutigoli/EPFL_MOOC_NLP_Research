1
00:00:05,435 --> 00:00:06,330
Welcome back.

2
00:00:06,738 --> 00:00:08,856
In the previous session,
we talked

3
00:00:08,956 --> 00:00:12,134
about the general implications
of digitalization.

4
00:00:12,521 --> 00:00:16,118
In this session, we will talk
about the implications

5
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,526
of digitalization on cities,
their performance,

6
00:00:19,726 --> 00:00:23,263
their infrastructures, 
and especially

7
00:00:23,432 --> 00:00:26,557
about the management
and governance challenges

8
00:00:26,657 --> 00:00:28,020
that this raises.

9
00:00:29,936 --> 00:00:33,802
Now, let's come back
to our original framework

10
00:00:33,902 --> 00:00:37,319
which we had already presented
in the previous MOOC,

11
00:00:39,562 --> 00:00:46,372
So, we have the urban infrastructures
that have particular performances

12
00:00:46,406 --> 00:00:50,936
which we divided into questions
of efficiency, sustainability,

13
00:00:51,024 --> 00:00:52,429
and resilience.

14
00:00:52,471 --> 00:00:55,690
These infrastructures are governed
and managed

15
00:00:56,172 --> 00:00:59,657
and we saw in the beginning
of this block

16
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:04,954
how this has to be seen
as a sociotechnical system

17
00:01:05,891 --> 00:01:08,377
mutually influencing each other.

18
00:01:08,738 --> 00:01:12,117
The performance
of these infrastructures

19
00:01:12,169 --> 00:01:15,544
has an implication
on the quality of life

20
00:01:15,716 --> 00:01:17,635
that citizens experience

21
00:01:18,175 --> 00:01:24,966
and of the competitiveness of a city
that is particularly relevant

22
00:01:25,095 --> 00:01:27,124
for the businesses.

23
00:01:27,341 --> 00:01:30,341
And both together,
citizens and businesses,

24
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:35,916
again determine the type
of governance and management

25
00:01:36,016 --> 00:01:38,501
of urban infrastructures.

26
00:01:38,563 --> 00:01:43,332
Now, there are a series of challenges
that cities have to face.

27
00:01:44,431 --> 00:01:47,136
Typically, those are
economic challenges,

28
00:01:47,336 --> 00:01:50,625
financial challenges,
social challenges,

29
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:53,040
metropolitan challenges

30
00:01:53,140 --> 00:01:54,820
resulting from the fact

31
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,027
that the metropolitan area
is much bigger, generally,

32
00:01:58,127 --> 00:01:59,930
than the political entity

33
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,456
and there are a lot
of political challenges.

34
00:02:03,677 --> 00:02:06,378
And finally, there are
technological challenges

35
00:02:06,477 --> 00:02:09,170
as all the technologies
in the infrastructures

36
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,960
are currently evolving.

37
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,370
What we are concerned with
in this MOOC

38
00:02:15,313 --> 00:02:19,611
is the particular effect
of digitalization,

39
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:22,581
and as we said,
the effect is pervasive.

40
00:02:22,629 --> 00:02:29,208
That is, it effects the infrastructure,
as well as the management

41
00:02:29,308 --> 00:02:31,441
and their governance.

42
00:02:34,024 --> 00:02:41,137
Now, different people use the word
"Smart City" for different things.

43
00:02:41,676 --> 00:02:48,775
And this slide is here to clarify
what we actually mean

44
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:50,161
by "Smart City".

45
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:56,801
So, there are people who focus
mainly on the economic dimension

46
00:02:56,826 --> 00:02:58,017
of "smart cities",

47
00:02:58,341 --> 00:03:03,068
and they are talking
about a digital economy.

48
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:11,829
That is, they are basically concerned
about how a city can create jobs,

49
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:17,331
revitalize its economy,
stimulate its economy,

50
00:03:17,986 --> 00:03:21,074
thanks to the information
and communication technologies.

51
00:03:21,436 --> 00:03:25,448
Typically, these people talk
about innovation parks,

52
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:30,057
about partnerships
between universities and industry

53
00:03:30,257 --> 00:03:35,652
and see the city, the "smart city",
as they say, as a place

54
00:03:35,752 --> 00:03:40,032
where the digital economy
can be stimulated.

55
00:03:41,102 --> 00:03:46,369
Then, there are people who look
in particular at the social dimensions

56
00:03:46,506 --> 00:03:50,968
of digitalization,
and they see in digitalization

57
00:03:51,033 --> 00:03:55,788
the potential to stimulate
community life by way

58
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:59,881
of online communities,
by way of social interactions,

59
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:06,396
by sort of stimulating, revitalizing
the social and the cultural life

60
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,418
in a city.

61
00:04:07,518 --> 00:04:10,782
For them, that's what
the "smart city" is about.

62
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:15,183
There are also people who talk
about this sharing economy

63
00:04:15,369 --> 00:04:18,369
and this sharing economy, I think,
has to be linked,

64
00:04:18,569 --> 00:04:23,879
between the digital economy
and the online community.

65
00:04:23,979 --> 00:04:26,195
So it's a combination of both.

66
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:32,615
And again, it is clear
that digitalization stimulates

67
00:04:32,758 --> 00:04:34,676
such sharing economy.

68
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:40,976
Finally, there are people who talk
about the whole political dimension.

69
00:04:41,063 --> 00:04:44,909
They see in digitalization
the potential 

70
00:04:48,977 --> 00:04:48,870
to stimulate citizen participation,

71
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,564
civil society or
stakeholder involvement

72
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:58,120
thanks to concepts like e-government,
e-governance, e-participation,

73
00:04:58,168 --> 00:05:01,450
and for them, this is what
the "smart city" is.

74
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:06,983
For us, the "smart city"
pertains mainly 

75
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:11,206
to the technological dimension,
that is to the infrastructures,

76
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:18,685
and this is also, I think, one
of the more generally accepted definitions

77
00:05:18,736 --> 00:05:20,492
of "smart city".

78
00:05:21,936 --> 00:05:27,210
So, to summarize, for us,
"smart city" is mainly focused

79
00:05:27,312 --> 00:05:30,698
on the technological dimension,
on the infrastructures,

80
00:05:30,798 --> 00:05:33,798
and we are not really concerned
with, in this MOOC,

81
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:39,393
about the digital economy,
the online communities,

82
00:05:39,593 --> 00:05:42,737
and the e-participation.

83
00:05:42,937 --> 00:05:47,544
So we have a more narrow definition
of what the "smart city" is.

84
00:05:47,744 --> 00:05:51,694
Let us illustrate that
by a few showcases.

85
00:05:51,756 --> 00:05:59,374
Again, those are things
that people typically invoke

86
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:03,384
when they talk about "smart city"
from an infrastructure,

87
00:06:04,313 --> 00:06:06,305
from a technological dimension.

88
00:06:06,421 --> 00:06:11,500
So things that we will see later on,
for example, on transport,

89
00:06:12,279 --> 00:06:18,877
smart cards, online
information mobility as a service,

90
00:06:19,489 --> 00:06:23,660
on the energy level, we talk
about smart metering,

91
00:06:24,048 --> 00:06:26,752
smart lighting, things like this.

92
00:06:26,883 --> 00:06:31,016
On the water level, we talk
about digital metering

93
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,976
and all kinds of things like this.

94
00:06:35,014 --> 00:06:39,834
Then there is a typical group
of people who talk

95
00:06:39,897 --> 00:06:42,896
about smart housing,
intelligent buildings,

96
00:06:43,096 --> 00:06:48,547
energy savings, thanks to that,
and the list is more or less endless.

97
00:06:48,647 --> 00:06:50,275
One can look at other things,

98
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:54,925
smart waste,
smart green infrastructures,

99
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:58,202
There are many other things
that can be added.

100
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:06,278
Those are all examples on the digital city
 infrastructure dimension.

101
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:13,246
So all these showcases, or examples
of "smart city", have to be put

102
00:07:13,383 --> 00:07:15,210
in to the broader picture.

103
00:07:15,772 --> 00:07:21,564
And the broader picture is
the implications that digitalization

104
00:07:21,714 --> 00:07:25,027
has on urban systems.

105
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:29,269
There are four main implications.

106
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:33,791
The first implication is
on the management

107
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:37,892
and governance
of the infrastructures themselves.

108
00:07:37,929 --> 00:07:42,936
The combination, for example,
between the legacy infrastructures

109
00:07:43,036 --> 00:07:48,388
and the opportunities
that the digitalization offers

110
00:07:48,552 --> 00:07:52,468
and this is a clear management
and governance challenge.

111
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:58,861
The infrastructures lead to services
on the basis of these infrastructures.

112
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:02,199
You have services, and thanks
to digitalization,

113
00:08:02,311 --> 00:08:07,948
there are plenty of new types of services,
new opportunities of services,

114
00:08:08,148 --> 00:08:15,632
and that leads to other implications
on managing and governing

115
00:08:15,845 --> 00:08:18,218
this services layer.

116
00:08:18,497 --> 00:08:23,013
What is really new for the city 
will be the implications

117
00:08:23,113 --> 00:08:24,832
on the management and the governance

118
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:27,790
of this digital or data layer?

119
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:31,121
This traditionally has not
been the case,

120
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:36,031
and the cities will have
to think hard

121
00:08:36,131 --> 00:08:40,829
about the implications
of managing this data layer.

122
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:48,015
And, of course, all together,
we have an urban sociotechnical system

123
00:08:48,065 --> 00:08:54,188
as we have seen and the fact
that digitalization somehow disrupts

124
00:08:54,251 --> 00:09:01,081
the way this urban system works leads
to big implications in terms

125
00:09:01,156 --> 00:09:05,500
of governing this system,
especially the institutions

126
00:09:05,563 --> 00:09:10,134
the rules about how
this system works.

127
00:09:10,298 --> 00:09:15,071
In the next two blocks, we will talk
about smart urban energy systems

128
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,335
and smart urban
transportation systems.

129
00:09:17,735 --> 00:09:21,175
And after that, we will come
back to all the elements

130
00:09:21,237 --> 00:09:23,574
that we have discussed here so far.

131
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:24,863
So stay tuned.
