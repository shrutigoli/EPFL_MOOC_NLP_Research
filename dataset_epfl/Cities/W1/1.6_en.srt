1
00:00:05,415 --> 00:00:06,144
Welcome back.

2
00:00:07,161 --> 00:00:08,733
So far we have talked

3
00:00:08,782 --> 00:00:12,783
about our conceptualization
of smart cities,

4
00:00:12,807 --> 00:00:16,363
the different elements that need
to be taken into account

5
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,012
for thinking properly
about Smart Cities.

6
00:00:21,047 --> 00:00:24,627
Now, the concept of Smart Cities

7
00:00:24,676 --> 00:00:28,195
is not originally
an academic concept.

8
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:31,174
It is a concept
 that is mainly pushed

9
00:00:31,374 --> 00:00:35,964
by vendors and pushed
by certain cities.

10
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:41,069
And so, what we are going to do
in this session is to present

11
00:00:41,269 --> 00:00:44,144
the different vendors' perspectives,

12
00:00:44,344 --> 00:00:46,746
then we'll present
the city's perspective

13
00:00:46,807 --> 00:00:49,946
and then we will briefly talk
about what is at stake

14
00:00:50,146 --> 00:00:52,876
in between these two perspectives.

15
00:00:53,783 --> 00:00:54,839
As we have said,

16
00:00:54,868 --> 00:00:58,256
and I think that's
the academic contribution to it,

17
00:00:58,281 --> 00:01:00,816
this distinction
between the infrastructure,

18
00:01:00,853 --> 00:01:03,550
the digital data layer
and the services,

19
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:08,740
leaving to the fact that you can
manage the infrastructures

20
00:01:08,777 --> 00:01:11,386
more smartly if you want

21
00:01:11,398 --> 00:01:15,930
and that there are
new, smart services possible

22
00:01:15,955 --> 00:01:19,469
on the basis of this digital layer.

23
00:01:19,907 --> 00:01:26,199
So, this is, let's say, the academic
sort of framing of Smart City.

24
00:01:26,236 --> 00:01:31,329
From here, we can look
at the different perspectives

25
00:01:31,366 --> 00:01:37,286
that are put forward
by different companies

26
00:01:37,486 --> 00:01:39,526
promoting Smart Cities.

27
00:01:39,564 --> 00:01:44,187
So there is first a perspective
of the hardware vendors,

28
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:50,657
these kind of companies
that produce the various devices.

29
00:01:50,660 --> 00:01:54,524
Generally, those are the
data generating devices,

30
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:59,853
the smart meters, the sensors,
the cameras, all these things

31
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:06,109
that basically contribute
to creating that digital layer.

32
00:02:06,881 --> 00:02:08,838
Then, there is the perspective

33
00:02:08,875 --> 00:02:13,232
of the infrastructure companies
themselves.

34
00:02:13,297 --> 00:02:17,272
Unlike the previous type
of companies,

35
00:02:17,279 --> 00:02:21,154
these companies
have traditionally been active

36
00:02:21,191 --> 00:02:27,302
in the urban arena,
be they urban water companies,

37
00:02:27,351 --> 00:02:30,462
electricity companies,
transport companies

38
00:02:30,511 --> 00:02:33,906
even postal services,
telecom operators.

39
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:38,304
These companies also
have embraced the concept

40
00:02:38,353 --> 00:02:42,637
of smart cities and put
that concept forward

41
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:47,966
because they can create
on the basis

42
00:02:47,984 --> 00:02:53,838
of their infrastructures,
a digital layer and services

43
00:02:53,888 --> 00:02:55,493
that go with it.

44
00:02:56,226 --> 00:03:02,775
And then there is a
third type of company or vendors.

45
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:06,422
They are new to the urban area.

46
00:03:06,471 --> 00:03:09,423
Those are the IBMs,
the Ciscos of the world.

47
00:03:09,435 --> 00:03:14,658
They offer services to manage,
to integrate this data,

48
00:03:14,682 --> 00:03:18,267
to manage this data,
to analyze this data,

49
00:03:18,737 --> 00:03:22,294
and they also are maybe
the most vocal ones

50
00:03:22,494 --> 00:03:26,531
in promoting the concept
of "Smart City".

51
00:03:28,417 --> 00:03:34,442
So, from here, we want to go
to the city's perspective.

52
00:03:34,466 --> 00:03:37,708
It's not exactly identical

53
00:03:37,732 --> 00:03:43,443
even though the city will rely
 on all the technologies

54
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:47,791
and the services that
the different vendors provide.

55
00:03:47,978 --> 00:03:50,967
So the city's perspective,
or let's say,

56
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:57,231
 the metropolitan area's perspective,
is the one of managing

57
00:03:57,268 --> 00:04:01,411
these infrastructures, of creating
the smart services

58
00:04:01,611 --> 00:04:06,304
that ultimately will serve
their citizens,

59
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:08,200
and their businesses.

60
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:11,007
Now, what is at stake
when you look

61
00:04:11,056 --> 00:04:13,171
at these two things combined?

62
00:04:13,182 --> 00:04:18,343
These two perspectives
 are not necessarily identical.

63
00:04:18,343 --> 00:04:21,543
They're overlapping,
but they're not necessarily identical.

64
00:04:21,567 --> 00:04:27,365
And so, we identify sort of
three things that are at stake.

65
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:32,410
 The first thing is really
the citizens versus the consumers.

66
00:04:32,635 --> 00:04:36,693
Typically, the vendors, they look
at consumers.

67
00:04:36,718 --> 00:04:40,684
They want to monetize the services
that they are providing,

68
00:04:40,709 --> 00:04:44,936
and, ultimately,
they will look at the consumers

69
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:50,547
of the smart services
that they are proposing.

70
00:04:51,859 --> 00:04:58,443
The second stake is the whole issue
of demand pull

71
00:04:58,492 --> 00:05:00,110
versus technology push.

72
00:05:00,793 --> 00:05:06,451
I mean, we have already said
that Smart City is very much a techpush

73
00:05:06,463 --> 00:05:09,651
It's built on digitalization

74
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:13,591
and digitalization is
a technological development.

75
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:19,864
And so, digitalization offers
plenty of opportunities

76
00:05:20,064 --> 00:05:24,989
for cities, but there is a
little bit of technology push

77
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:29,369
especially by the vendors,
to adopt these new technologies.

78
00:05:29,394 --> 00:05:31,692
Whereas, on the city's perspective,

79
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:34,337
this would rather be
a demand view. 

80
00:05:34,374 --> 00:05:35,929
Is this actually needed?

81
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:41,433
Does it help the city to make better,
more efficiently managed

82
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:44,787
new services that are
actually demanded?

83
00:05:44,987 --> 00:05:50,611
And so, ultimately, I think
the main stake here

84
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:54,331
 is the leadership
of this transformation.

85
00:05:54,356 --> 00:05:59,799
Is this transformation.
the transition towards a Smart City

86
00:05:59,823 --> 00:06:06,009
sort of led by the vendors,
the companies

87
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:08,706
that can provide
these kind of services?

88
00:06:08,743 --> 00:06:14,933
Or is it led by the city
or the metropolitan area itself

89
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:19,746
or at least appropriated by the city
or the metropolitan area?

90
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:23,625
In this first week, you have
learned about cities

91
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:26,161
as sociotechnical systems.

92
00:06:26,211 --> 00:06:30,433
We have shown you
how cities are best conceptualized

93
00:06:30,485 --> 00:06:34,160
as complex, dynamic
sociotechnical systems.

94
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:40,101
Then, I talked about digitalization,
what digitalization is,

95
00:06:40,113 --> 00:06:44,402
and the different elements
that compose digitalization.

96
00:06:44,707 --> 00:06:49,877
After that, we have looked
at what digitalization does to cities

97
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:52,672
and what Smart Cities actually are.

98
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:57,299
And just before, I have talked
about different perspectives

99
00:06:57,323 --> 00:06:58,779
on Smart Cities -

100
00:06:58,816 --> 00:07:01,415
the vendors' perspective,
the city's perspective,

101
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,829
and our own academic perspective.

102
00:07:05,309 --> 00:07:07,117
Now, in the coming week,

103
00:07:07,154 --> 00:07:10,496
we will talk
about smart energy systems

104
00:07:10,525 --> 00:07:15,933
and apply these concepts
to the energy part of urban systems.

105
00:07:16,442 --> 00:07:19,643
But just before that, we will hear
about Barcelona.

106
00:07:19,818 --> 00:07:21,693
So stay tuned.
