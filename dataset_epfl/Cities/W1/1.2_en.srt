1
00:00:05,426 --> 00:00:07,401
Welcome to this first session. 

2
00:00:08,266 --> 00:00:13,704
In this session, we will talk about
cities as socio-technical systems.

3
00:00:13,904 --> 00:00:18,554
This is the way we are looking at
cities in this MOOC.

4
00:00:19,533 --> 00:00:25,320
And infrastructures are a particular
type of socio technical-system.

5
00:00:26,141 --> 00:00:30,704
Finally we will look at the 
implications of this view on the

6
00:00:30,766 --> 00:00:36,266
management and the governance of
cities and their infrastructures. 

7
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:43,123
So, cities are a place where people
live and work together.

8
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:50,036
And different people look at this
living and working together from

9
00:00:50,086 --> 00:00:53,911
different perspectives. So there are
people who look at cities as an

10
00:00:53,986 --> 00:00:56,374
economic system. 

11
00:00:56,792 --> 00:01:00,367
The generation of wealth, 
the generation of jobs, 

12
00:01:00,417 --> 00:01:06,429
the economic interactions, the
economic conditions for the workings

13
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,979
of a city as an economic system.

14
00:01:09,356 --> 00:01:13,931
Typically economists look at cities
as an economic system.

15
00:01:14,379 --> 00:01:20,954
Sociologists rather look at cities as
a social system, it's a way of life

16
00:01:21,042 --> 00:01:29,567
of cultural life, of social life, of
activities, of inequities

17
00:01:29,604 --> 00:01:32,042
and all these kind of things.

18
00:01:32,528 --> 00:01:36,378
Then there are people who look at
cities as a political system,

19
00:01:36,441 --> 00:01:39,741
how the different actors
interact with each other, 

20
00:01:39,803 --> 00:01:46,278
who decides about what, who has power
over what. So it is also possible to

21
00:01:46,328 --> 00:01:49,578
look at cities as such 
political systems.

22
00:01:49,766 --> 00:01:54,628
Our approach is to look in
particular at cities as a

23
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:56,428
technological system.

24
00:01:56,628 --> 00:01:59,253
Typically the infrastructures

25
00:01:59,303 --> 00:02:00,715
constitute the

26
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:04,115
technological system of a city.

27
00:02:04,103 --> 00:02:09,441
And of course all these things are
interrelated which exactly makes the

28
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:12,191
city a socio-technical system. 

29
00:02:12,378 --> 00:02:16,853
The way the technology works effects
the economy, the way the economy

30
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:22,441
works effects whether you have money
to invest in technology the same for

31
00:02:22,516 --> 00:02:25,303
the social and political dimensions.

32
00:02:25,605 --> 00:02:30,505
So this is the very systemic
view of a city. 

33
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:37,316
Now more precisely, as we said,
the city is a place where people

34
00:02:37,366 --> 00:02:39,103
live and work together. 

35
00:02:39,228 --> 00:02:44,203
The infrastructures, the urban
infrastructures enable such

36
00:02:44,303 --> 00:02:47,353
collective living and working. 

37
00:02:47,788 --> 00:02:52,201
And this is typically done
in a systemic fashion.

38
00:02:52,288 --> 00:02:59,701
The infrastructures enable the way
that people work, the way that people

39
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:02,563
live, the way that people decide.

40
00:03:03,782 --> 00:03:08,582
You can easily imagine how the
infrastructures are built that

41
00:03:08,644 --> 00:03:13,207
effects social life. Is it easy to
reach the city center or not?

42
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:18,500
Is the traffic flowing, is it not
flowing? Is water available?

43
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:23,888
All this effects the quality of
life, of social life and of

44
00:03:23,938 --> 00:03:25,788
economic life of a city. 

45
00:03:26,063 --> 00:03:27,875
But also the other way around

46
00:03:28,075 --> 00:03:32,624
the economic and social
and political life

47
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:39,463
determines how the infrastructures
are maintained, built, invested in,

48
00:03:39,588 --> 00:03:45,238
developed. So it is easily
understandable that depending on 

49
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:49,975
the political decision making
processes, investments are done in 

50
00:03:50,025 --> 00:03:53,925
certain parts of the cities and not
done in other parts of the cities. 

51
00:03:55,225 --> 00:04:01,338
Business parks are created here, not
there. So typically the city is such

52
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:07,913
a complex socio-technical system
that decides upon the infrastructure

53
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:12,100
which in turn decide upon the
social life of a city. 

54
00:04:12,845 --> 00:04:16,507
Now, at the same time, one can
look a little bit more in detail. 

55
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,582
To look at the infrastructures
themselves as a socio-technical system.

56
00:04:23,495 --> 00:04:28,670
And so we have infrastructures, such
typical infrastructures, such as

57
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,695
transport, housing, buildings,
energy, water and other things

58
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,232
you can add. Waste water, waste. 

59
00:04:37,107 --> 00:04:45,257
And the way these infrastructures
are laid out effect the way that the

60
00:04:45,307 --> 00:04:50,770
social and political and economic
life of a city is happening.

61
00:04:51,257 --> 00:04:57,095
Inversely, the decisions made at
these levels will effect where

62
00:04:57,157 --> 00:05:01,007
housing is going to be, whether
transport is developed here or there

63
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,392
whether energy is renewable
or not renewable

64
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:07,767
whether water is cleaned
or not cleaned. 

65
00:05:07,842 --> 00:05:12,179
So one can really look at urban
infrastructure systems

66
00:05:12,792 --> 00:05:20,342
as a socio-technical system in itself
as part of a larger urban system.

67
00:05:22,715 --> 00:05:28,352
Now this systemic view of cities
clearly has implications on the

68
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:30,665
management and the
governance of cities.

69
00:05:31,209 --> 00:05:35,959
The most important concept here is
the concept of feedback loops.

70
00:05:36,775 --> 00:05:42,525
So all these elements of the system,
of course, interact with each other

71
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,237
and create feedback.

72
00:05:44,945 --> 00:05:50,108
The social dimensions interact with
the technical dimensions. 

73
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:53,532
The technical dimensions interact
with the economic dimensions and

74
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:55,654
all this creates feedback loops. 

75
00:05:55,717 --> 00:06:03,529
This makes cities very, very complex
and the outcomes of what happens in

76
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:07,442
the city is never attributable to
one single cause. 

77
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:10,504
All these elements are related to
each other.

78
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,920
And of course, all these things are
also path dependent. 

79
00:06:15,219 --> 00:06:20,344
So decisions that have been made at
some point in the past deploy their

80
00:06:20,393 --> 00:06:24,755
effects later in the future. What
happens today, may be caused by

81
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:28,426
an array of complex interactions 

82
00:06:28,626 --> 00:06:31,626
and feedback loops that
come from the past.

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,963
Let us illustrate that in the context
of cities. So the city is in its 

84
00:06:39,038 --> 00:06:43,088
environment. And as we said,
the city and especially its

85
00:06:43,163 --> 00:06:49,325
infrastructure are a complex
socio-technical system interacting

86
00:06:49,388 --> 00:06:50,413
with each other. 

87
00:06:50,525 --> 00:06:53,263
So there are feedback loops
on both sides. 

88
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:55,550
There are technical feedback loops.

89
00:06:55,750 --> 00:07:01,900
The way housing works effects
transport. Transport effects energy.

90
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:08,725
All these technical feedback loops
are going on inside a city. 

91
00:07:08,813 --> 00:07:12,300
Similarly there are social
feedback loops. 

92
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,763
The different actors interact
with each other. 

93
00:07:14,838 --> 00:07:18,438
What is done economically has an
impact on the social life.

94
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:25,163
What happens socially has an impact
on finances, on the economic life. 

95
00:07:25,363 --> 00:07:30,150
And then, of course, even more
so there are interactions, 

96
00:07:30,234 --> 00:07:35,834
as I said before, between the social
dimensions and the 

97
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:37,996
technical dimensions themselves. 

98
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:42,271
So how the technology is laid
out effects the social life, 

99
00:07:42,334 --> 00:07:46,796
effects the way people work, whether
they get to work or not, whether

100
00:07:46,996 --> 00:07:51,821
they have water or not and the
other way around, of course, also. 

101
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:57,346
Now all this, and this is our
particular approach to the city, 

102
00:07:57,546 --> 00:08:01,959
all this leads to certain types of
performance of a city.

103
00:08:02,411 --> 00:08:07,049
We have classified performance in
terms of efficiency, resilience and

104
00:08:07,124 --> 00:08:12,649
sustainability of cities but it is
easily understandable that all these

105
00:08:12,724 --> 00:08:18,161
feedback loops, the complexity, the
path dependency makes the management

106
00:08:18,261 --> 00:08:24,399
and the governance of these cities
extremely complex, unpredictable 

107
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:31,049
and we need to take that fact
into account when we manage

108
00:08:31,099 --> 00:08:32,299
and govern cities. 

109
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:36,486
This is basically what our previous
MOOC was all about. 

110
00:08:36,686 --> 00:08:47,336
What is new is this digitalization,
the data layer which comes of top of

111
00:08:47,536 --> 00:08:50,536
all these cities as a socio 
technological system.

112
00:08:50,736 --> 00:08:56,811
And what we are going to do in this
MOOC, is to try to understand what

113
00:08:57,011 --> 00:09:02,511
digitalization as a new layer coming
on top of the systemic view

114
00:09:02,711 --> 00:09:06,124
does to the management and
the governance of urban

115
00:09:06,224 --> 00:09:08,024
infrastructure systems.
