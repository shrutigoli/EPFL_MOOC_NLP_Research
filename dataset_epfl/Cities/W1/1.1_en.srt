00:00:06,065 --> 00:00:10,040
Welcome to the 1st week of our
Smart Cities MOOC. 

2
00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:15,940
I'm sure you have asked yourself
whether Smart Cities is a hype

3
00:00:16,013 --> 00:00:19,013
or a reality, or both. 

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,595
and that is what this first week
is all about, that is understanding

5
00:00:24,685 --> 00:00:26,971
what Smart Cities really are. 

6
00:00:28,325 --> 00:00:32,988
Now you can expect the following
outcomes from this 1st week. 

7
00:00:33,518 --> 00:00:39,443
First we will talk about thinking Smart
Cities, how to think Smart Cities.

8
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:44,055
then we will offer a
conceptualization of Smart Cities

9
00:00:44,863 --> 00:00:51,538
and thirdly, we will detail exactly
the impact that digitization has

10
00:00:51,606 --> 00:00:54,556
on cities, making them Smart Cities.

11
00:00:55,082 --> 00:00:59,282
and finally, we will look at the
implications of all of this for

12
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,545
management and governance of
cities or Smart Cities. 

13
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:10,341
Now from our previous MOOC, we take
this basic distinction between

14
00:01:10,404 --> 00:01:15,866
infrastructures or an infrastructure
layer and services or a services layer. 

15
00:01:16,527 --> 00:01:21,740
It is on the basis of
infrastructures like water pipes 

16
00:01:21,815 --> 00:01:27,465
that water services, infrastructure
services are being provided 

17
00:01:27,527 --> 00:01:29,740
to customers and citizens. 

18
00:01:30,655 --> 00:01:38,730
What is new is really this digital
layer that comes in between

19
00:01:38,793 --> 00:01:43,680
infrastructures and services
and this changes everything. 

20
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:52,401
Now the 1st week is structured
into 6 different sessions.

21
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:58,837
In the 1st session, we will present
our conceptualization of cities as 

22
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,975
socio-technical systems.

23
00:02:01,075 --> 00:02:06,124
This is necessary because only on
the basis of this conceptualization, 

24
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:10,612
can we really understand the
concept of Smart Cities. 

25
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:15,091
In the 2nd session, we will
look at digitization. 

26
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:16,829
What is it exactly?

27
00:02:17,730 --> 00:02:22,329
In the 3rd session, we will look at
the general implications that

28
00:02:22,393 --> 00:02:27,593
such digitization has on
society, on industries. 

29
00:02:28,079 --> 00:02:32,804
In the 4th session, we will look,
in particular, at the implications

30
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,529
of digitization on the cities. 

31
00:02:36,478 --> 00:02:41,690
and then we will show that there are
actually 2 different perspectives

32
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:44,153
one can have on Smart Cities. 

33
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,662
Finally we will hear from one of the
leading cities in the world

34
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:53,613
that has pioneered the transition to
Smart Cities. 

35
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:59,019
So, let us move to the 1st
session now talking about

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,333
socio-technical systems
