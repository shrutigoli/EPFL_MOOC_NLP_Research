1
00:00:04,969 --> 00:00:06,943
Hello, and welcome
back to the course.

2
00:00:07,057 --> 00:00:10,477
Today I have the pleasure
of receiving Irene Compte,

3
00:00:10,501 --> 00:00:12,364
who is senior consultant

4
00:00:12,413 --> 00:00:15,108
in the consulting firm Anteverti

5
00:00:15,308 --> 00:00:17,641
which is a consulting firm
based in Barcelona,

6
00:00:17,644 --> 00:00:19,398
and they are specialized
in the domain

7
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:21,950
of the "Smart Cities"
and eco innovation.

8
00:00:21,986 --> 00:00:24,595
Thank you very much for
being with us here, Irene.

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:26,454
Thank you for the invitation.

10
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:27,179
It's a pleasure.

11
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:28,693
Thank you very much.

12
00:00:28,693 --> 00:00:30,879
So the first question that
I would like to discuss

13
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:32,630
with you is about Barcelona.

14
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:35,743
You have been involved with Barcelona
for quite some time.

15
00:00:35,755 --> 00:00:38,028
and can you give us a little
bit of background

16
00:00:38,053 --> 00:00:39,982
about the evolution of thinking

17
00:00:40,182 --> 00:00:42,264
about the "Smart Cities"
in Barcelona?

18
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:44,671
Of course.

19
00:00:44,871 --> 00:00:50,159
I have been knowing
the politics, the policies

20
00:00:50,171 --> 00:00:51,241
of "Smart Cities"

21
00:00:51,278 --> 00:00:54,927
in Barcelona for the last,
I would say,

22
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:55,933
ten to twelve years.

23
00:00:56,928 --> 00:00:59,928
Although, there was some
innovation happening

24
00:01:00,128 --> 00:01:01,775
even before the
"Smart City" concept

25
00:01:01,975 --> 00:01:04,477
was implemented as such.

26
00:01:04,677 --> 00:01:07,480
Barcelona has always been,
we think,

27
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,704
a quite innovative city,

28
00:01:09,904 --> 00:01:13,209
mainly in the urbanism domain

29
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,986
and now, also in the
"Smart Cities" domain.

30
00:01:17,186 --> 00:01:19,256
So there has been, like,
a natural link,

31
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,544
a progression from
the innovation in urbanism,

32
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:25,490
in the way the city was designed
and planned and managed,

33
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:29,613
into this new concept
of "Smart Cities" or urban innovation.

34
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:34,221
This progression has taken Barcelona

35
00:01:34,421 --> 00:01:39,077
from a first stage when
the "Smart City" concept arrived,

36
00:01:40,577 --> 00:01:43,741
where technology was really leading

37
00:01:44,021 --> 00:01:47,021
any action that the city was taking.

38
00:01:47,221 --> 00:01:50,221
And this was not exclusive
from Barcelona.

39
00:01:50,421 --> 00:01:52,737
I would say that in any city,
the first stage is

40
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,239
or the first stages
of their approach to smartness

41
00:01:57,663 --> 00:02:03,889
were going through
technology and new sensors,

42
00:02:04,089 --> 00:02:08,242
new gadgets and how it can help
the transition into smartness.

43
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:11,442
And it's interesting to see
how Barcelona

44
00:02:11,642 --> 00:02:15,310
and other cities have,
in these last ten years,

45
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:19,056
evolved into a richer concept
of smartness

46
00:02:19,256 --> 00:02:21,568
which I think it's the way it
had to be.

47
00:02:21,768 --> 00:02:23,008
You start with technology,

48
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:26,485
thinking the technology
is what's going to change

49
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:27,996
and, of course,
the evolution takes you

50
00:02:28,021 --> 00:02:35,436
to introducing governance factors
and this is when,

51
00:02:35,473 --> 00:02:43,983
the moment when the local government
takes lead on technology, okay?

52
00:02:44,447 --> 00:02:46,935
And starts to decide
on how technology

53
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:49,925
can really be useful
for the citizens

54
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,900
and, I would say Barcelona is now

55
00:02:52,912 --> 00:02:55,941
in this kind of third stage
of Smart Cities

56
00:02:56,141 --> 00:02:59,141
where we have the technology,

57
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:00,895
we have the governance,

58
00:03:01,095 --> 00:03:02,845
and the surveillance,
let's say,

59
00:03:03,045 --> 00:03:04,402
from the local government,

60
00:03:04,426 --> 00:03:06,882
and we have a third,
very important factor

61
00:03:07,082 --> 00:03:10,082
which is the citizen-centered
approach, okay?

62
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:12,701
So, clearly Barcelona
is now,

63
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:16,766
in their approach to Smart City,
in this stage.

64
00:03:16,778 --> 00:03:22,976
The new policies, from
a quite new local government

65
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:24,978
which changed
some months ago

66
00:03:25,178 --> 00:03:30,217
are clearly focused on putting
the citizen at the center

67
00:03:30,217 --> 00:03:35,057
of any sustainability,
smartness, digital policy.

68
00:03:37,051 --> 00:03:41,057
And acting from there
and looking for the benefit

69
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:43,159
of the life for the citizen.

70
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:44,329
Great

71
00:03:44,341 --> 00:03:46,405
this leads me to the
second question,

72
00:03:46,429 --> 00:03:47,675
basically, which is about

73
00:03:47,675 --> 00:03:49,140
what would be the vision

74
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:52,076
of Barcelona for next
ten, fifteen years, let's say?

75
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:54,273
How you said they started
from technology

76
00:03:54,284 --> 00:03:57,015
then to the governance
and then to the citizens, and then

77
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:00,454
what would be the next step
that you think would evolve,

78
00:04:00,654 --> 00:04:01,991
eventually?

79
00:04:02,191 --> 00:04:06,926
Well, if one looks at
the new digital agenda,

80
00:04:07,126 --> 00:04:11,617
the digital plan for the city
which will go until 2020,

81
00:04:11,617 --> 00:04:11,630
at least, and then for sure more,
the digital plan for the city
which will go until 2020,

82
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:13,445
at least, and then for sure more,

83
00:04:16,102 --> 00:04:18,609
one will find some key words,

84
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:22,499
Technology is regarded as a mean

85
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,456
for key words such as "openness".

86
00:04:27,151 --> 00:04:32,174
They speak a lot about Barcelona
being an open city

87
00:04:32,774 --> 00:04:37,324
in the wider sense of the word,
which means inclusive,

88
00:04:37,336 --> 00:04:38,747
which is another key word.

89
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,930
Democratic city - how technology
will help us

90
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:46,172
to have a more democratic city
where people,

91
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:49,657
the citizens, will participate -
that's another keyword.

92
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:54,066
So participation and
technology helping participation.

93
00:04:55,291 --> 00:04:57,828
Innovation is another keyword
that you will find

94
00:04:57,852 --> 00:04:59,950
in this digital agenda.

95
00:04:59,974 --> 00:05:05,563
Innovation has also,
very wide uses and wide senses.

96
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:11,940
We will see a lot of social -
the so-called social innovation,

97
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:15,920
which also links to another key word
that they are using,

98
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,623
which is "circular".
A circular city.

99
00:05:18,635 --> 00:05:23,500
Which leads to a new trend,
very interesting, in my opinion,

100
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:25,745
which is a circular economy
in cities.

101
00:05:25,945 --> 00:05:29,591
I would say these are some of
the most important key words

102
00:05:29,603 --> 00:05:33,012
in the future of the approach.

103
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:34,454
Great. Very interesting.

104
00:05:34,466 --> 00:05:36,956
Let me become
a little bit more

105
00:05:36,969 --> 00:05:38,204
practical and concrete.

106
00:05:38,216 --> 00:05:41,108
So this is a vision of Barcelona
and how things evolved.

107
00:05:41,128 --> 00:05:44,665
Can you elaborate a little bit
for our audience

108
00:05:44,812 --> 00:05:46,603
What are the practical challenges

109
00:05:46,628 --> 00:05:50,921
in managing the transition process
from, you know, legacy Barcelona

110
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:57,239
to a smart Barcelona to 2015, 2016
and a smart Barcelona, 2030, maybe?

111
00:05:57,326 --> 00:06:00,980
A little bit of elaboration
on the practical challenges

112
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:07,934
There are a lot,
as any ambitious vision

113
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:12,572
When you start implementing it,
then you face the reality.

114
00:06:13,245 --> 00:06:17,541
I would say the main,
or one of the main challenges,

115
00:06:17,557 --> 00:06:23,099
is integration of existing innovation,
because, as I said,

116
00:06:23,111 --> 00:06:25,945
Barcelona has always been
on the move for innovation.

117
00:06:26,324 --> 00:06:28,230
So you have
some existing infrastructure,

118
00:06:28,242 --> 00:06:29,844
some existing policies,

119
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:34,789
existing technical teams
in the municipality.

120
00:06:35,064 --> 00:06:39,581
And when you bring new elements,
such as new information infrastructures,

121
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:42,553
or new policies,
or new ways of doing,

122
00:06:43,232 --> 00:06:48,170
the first and really big challenge
is integrating this into something

123
00:06:48,182 --> 00:06:51,205
which is efficient and
which really makes a difference.

124
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:55,042
This transition is never, never easy
and is never fast.

125
00:06:56,323 --> 00:06:59,194
And this is for Barcelona,
but really for any city.

126
00:07:00,313 --> 00:07:03,076
And this happened, as well,
in the last ten years,

127
00:07:03,076 --> 00:07:08,384
when Barcelona started to try
new technologies.

128
00:07:08,387 --> 00:07:10,604
We have something interesting
in Barcelona

129
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:14,896
which is called the Urban Lab,
which is an area of the city

130
00:07:14,903 --> 00:07:20,066
dedicated for startup companies
or innovative companies

131
00:07:20,103 --> 00:07:23,984
to try new technologies
in the streets of the city

132
00:07:23,996 --> 00:07:26,518
and work closely
with the municipality

133
00:07:26,542 --> 00:07:29,422
to really find the best users
of this solutions.

134
00:07:29,932 --> 00:07:32,932
So this happened, we had
some learning from there

135
00:07:33,132 --> 00:07:36,187
but it was not without difficulties.

136
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:40,191
Also, because, another challenge,
I would say,

137
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:47,380
is when you bring in new technologies,
new approaches to digital citizenship,

138
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:52,004
new business models need to arise.

139
00:07:54,403 --> 00:08:00,521
And not only for private companies,
also the local government has to introduce

140
00:08:00,533 --> 00:08:05,463
some changes in their procurement.
So we will hear a lot in the coming years

141
00:08:05,663 --> 00:08:10,491
on innovative public procurement,
which is another challenging area

142
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:14,086
I would say, because as we all
know by now,

143
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:19,267
this Smart City projects,
the implementation of these solutions

144
00:08:19,267 --> 00:08:25,382
are long term projects and
financing is another big challenge.

145
00:08:25,407 --> 00:08:29,696
So who finances innovation?
Sometimes the local administration,

146
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:32,353
makes the push and the first move.

147
00:08:33,494 --> 00:08:41,856
But then these lead to maintenance,
so innovative procurement, financing,

148
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:46,467
integration of the existing
with the new approaches

149
00:08:46,667 --> 00:08:48,732
these are three,
and I would add four.

150
00:08:48,769 --> 00:08:50,176
There's probably more.

151
00:08:50,176 --> 00:08:52,698
But a fourth would be

152
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:58,639
how to really make
the citizens participate

153
00:08:59,035 --> 00:09:04,723
not only be informed that their city
is working towards innovation,

154
00:09:04,748 --> 00:09:09,498
efficiency, sustainability,
but really how to make them

155
00:09:09,498 --> 00:09:14,774
participate in the equation
because it's a long-term project

156
00:09:14,786 --> 00:09:18,031
where all the stakeholders
need to be involved.

157
00:09:18,962 --> 00:09:22,180
Great.
I also know that

158
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:24,840
you have been involved
in all these European projects,

159
00:09:24,857 --> 00:09:26,381
not only in Barcelona.

160
00:09:26,382 --> 00:09:27,279
And the lessons

161
00:09:27,316 --> 00:09:29,298
from Barcelona
are pretty interesting.

162
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:32,025
But can you also elaborate
a little bit one what's happening

163
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:34,292
in Europe
in the broader perspective?

164
00:09:34,525 --> 00:09:36,794
How Europe is approaching
the smart cities,

165
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:38,259
other cities across Europe...

166
00:09:38,284 --> 00:09:41,037
Do you know of any initiative
happening right now?

167
00:09:42,139 --> 00:09:43,894
There's many. There's many.

168
00:09:43,896 --> 00:09:48,533
I know some of them,
but particularly a project,

169
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:53,122
a European project
which is under a program

170
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,758
called "The Lighthouse" project.

171
00:09:56,630 --> 00:10:00,893
We are working actively
with the municipality of Barcelona

172
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:02,797
on a project called "Grow Smarter".

173
00:10:04,993 --> 00:10:07,882
Let's see, the framework
of this project

174
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:10,952
is the goal of Europe
and the European commission

175
00:10:11,264 --> 00:10:16,892
to make Europe sustainable
in the short, mid- and long-term.

176
00:10:16,917 --> 00:10:18,581
They started many years ago.

177
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:21,668
The Lighthouse program is
a specific one

178
00:10:21,705 --> 00:10:24,816
which is tackling
environmental sustainability.

179
00:10:24,978 --> 00:10:27,203
but also economic sustainability,

180
00:10:27,432 --> 00:10:32,638
and it deals a lot
with how we manage and plant cities

181
00:10:32,838 --> 00:10:36,861
today and in the coming years
to fulfil these goals

182
00:10:36,873 --> 00:10:37,987
of sustainability.

183
00:10:37,999 --> 00:10:46,343
So the Lighthouse program promotes
consortiums of European cities

184
00:10:46,368 --> 00:10:50,358
in this case, the "Grow Smarter" project
has three leading cities.

185
00:10:50,370 --> 00:10:51,768
One is Barcelona

186
00:10:51,793 --> 00:10:53,792
the other one is Stockholm,
in Sweden,

187
00:10:53,804 --> 00:10:56,009
and the third is Koln,
in Germany.

188
00:10:57,111 --> 00:11:00,237
Different areas of Europe
with different environmental needs

189
00:11:00,437 --> 00:11:02,139
and environmental realities.

190
00:11:02,151 --> 00:11:06,709
Of course, the Mediterranean has
certain specificities

191
00:11:06,721 --> 00:11:08,080
in terms of climate and so on -

192
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,201
different than in Stockholm and Koln.

193
00:11:10,213 --> 00:11:13,222
So that's the first thing
which is interesting of this project.

194
00:11:13,575 --> 00:11:18,922
The objectives are, I would say,
threefold in this case.

195
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:23,100
It's to try measures
or smart solutions

196
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:26,489
towards sustainability
in three areas.

197
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:30,631
The first one is try solutions
or develop solutions

198
00:11:30,831 --> 00:11:33,908
in what we call
"low energy districts".

199
00:11:34,246 --> 00:11:38,500
So, how can we intervene
on buildings, on the streets,

200
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,876
on the energy systems

201
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:43,668
that the buildings share and use
to make them more efficient

202
00:11:43,673 --> 00:11:48,748
and reduce emissions
and reduce energy consumption?

203
00:11:48,893 --> 00:11:51,610
The second area would be solutions

204
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:54,859
on integrating
information infrastructures.

205
00:11:55,059 --> 00:11:57,420
So, how can we build,
for example,

206
00:11:57,445 --> 00:12:02,429
city platforms which integrate data
and information resources

207
00:12:02,629 --> 00:12:04,494
in order, again,
to be more efficient?

208
00:12:04,506 --> 00:12:07,270
And the third area
is sustainable mobility,

209
00:12:07,295 --> 00:12:10,718
because, of course,
it's not new to anyone

210
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,901
that mobility is one
of the key issues

211
00:12:12,924 --> 00:12:15,889
in, not only European cities,
but worldwide.

212
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:22,696
So when we intervene in mobility
and implement efficiency in it,

213
00:12:23,376 --> 00:12:27,356
we will be tackling one
of the most pressing problems

214
00:12:27,368 --> 00:12:28,095
in cities.

215
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,721
So the project is trying solutions
at district level

216
00:12:32,921 --> 00:12:33,925
in these three areas.

217
00:12:34,230 --> 00:12:36,718
Great. And, you know,
that was an interesting point

218
00:12:36,955 --> 00:12:40,256
because you mentioned about the smart,
but the smart seems not to be

219
00:12:40,277 --> 00:12:41,302
a goal in itself.

220
00:12:41,314 --> 00:12:44,901
This is a smart for improving
sustainability or efficiency,

221
00:12:44,912 --> 00:12:45,776
as you mentioned.

222
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:48,052
And I think, you know,
that's an important point -

223
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:50,803
that sometimes is missing
in the Smart Cities discourse.

224
00:12:51,535 --> 00:12:52,729
Yes, it's clear.

225
00:12:52,729 --> 00:12:56,124
Actually, you cannot speak
about sustainable

226
00:12:56,136 --> 00:12:59,138
without speaking of smart
and the other way around.

227
00:12:59,175 --> 00:13:00,625
Exactly. Good.

228
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:01,906
Thank you very much, Irene.

229
00:13:01,917 --> 00:13:03,710
It was very insightful

230
00:13:03,734 --> 00:13:05,310
and thanks for joining us
here in the course.

231
00:13:05,322 --> 00:13:07,120
Thank you for the invitation.
