00:00:05,424 --> 00:00:06,986
Hello and welcome back. 

2
00:00:07,314 --> 00:00:10,464
In this session, we will
conceptualize the transition

3
00:00:10,476 --> 00:00:14,976
into smart urban transportation
system and we do this in 3 steps. 

4
00:00:15,605 --> 00:00:21,130
We will firstly identify the main 3
drivers towards such systems

5
00:00:21,157 --> 00:00:25,432
and then we will conceptualize the
evolution of these systems

6
00:00:25,466 --> 00:00:31,628
and finally we will lay out the 2
main steps that it takes in order

7
00:00:32,448 --> 00:00:34,310
to make this transition

8
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:37,281
Now the main drivers. 

9
00:00:37,745 --> 00:00:43,445
There are 3 main drivers, we think,
that push towards smarter

10
00:00:43,486 --> 00:00:45,174
urban transportation systems.

11
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:48,293
The first one is one is,
of course, urbanization.

12
00:00:49,254 --> 00:00:51,604
More people living in cities.

13
00:00:52,616 --> 00:00:56,116
Transport becomes more
and more congested

14
00:00:56,164 --> 00:01:00,664
and the users have an
increasingly poor experience,

15
00:01:00,746 --> 00:01:04,696
be it the users of the car
or the bicycle or the buses 

16
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:11,758
and that is certainly one of the
main drivers that pushes for

17
00:01:12,489 --> 00:01:13,714
smarter systems 

18
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,771
and the second driver is the
main topic that we have 

19
00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:20,484
always dealt with in this MOOC.

20
00:01:20,526 --> 00:01:26,876
That is the digitalization that
actually makes a whole series of

21
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,595
changes that makes smarter urban
transportation systems possible.

22
00:01:33,149 --> 00:01:38,874
And the third driver here is climate
change or resource efficiency.

23
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,973
Approximately 15 - 20% of
global CO2 emissions actually

24
00:01:46,824 --> 00:01:49,099
come from urban transportation

25
00:01:49,223 --> 00:01:51,898
and so there is a strong push

26
00:01:52,639 --> 00:01:57,077
to make these systems more
efficient and make them smarter. 

27
00:01:57,514 --> 00:02:02,926
These 3 drivers together push towards
smarter urban transportation systems.

28
00:02:05,034 --> 00:02:07,247
Now how to think about
this evolution and

29
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:09,722
how to conceptualize this evolution?

30
00:02:09,809 --> 00:02:13,197
There was transport in
the cities before the car.

31
00:02:13,371 --> 00:02:16,133
There were actually trams
in the cities or carriages

32
00:02:16,403 --> 00:02:20,478
and when the car appeared,
the efficiency of urban

33
00:02:20,556 --> 00:02:23,994
transportation initially increased

34
00:02:24,631 --> 00:02:29,368
but then as more and more
cars entered the city,

35
00:02:29,703 --> 00:02:32,878
as there were more and more
people using the cars,

36
00:02:32,982 --> 00:02:38,782
at some point the car led to some
sort of counter-productivity

37
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:44,607
where by more cars in the
city actually led to a poorer 

38
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,302
user experience

39
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:50,127
and the efficiency of urban
transportation systems 

40
00:02:50,278 --> 00:02:55,203
rapidly declined to the point
where we think we are today.

41
00:02:56,751 --> 00:02:59,588
So here we are at a point where

42
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:04,902
digitalization and the other drivers

43
00:03:04,934 --> 00:03:08,947
together will lead to a
paradigm shift.

44
00:03:09,024 --> 00:03:13,561
We don't know yet where
exactly this will lead to after

45
00:03:13,594 --> 00:03:18,794
but we can clearly identify the 2
elements of that paradigm shift.

46
00:03:19,136 --> 00:03:23,811
The first element being the fact
that people want to own

47
00:03:23,873 --> 00:03:28,111
 less and less things,
including cars

48
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:31,786
and they want to use the vehicles

49
00:03:31,898 --> 00:03:35,473
they want to use the
transportation modes.

50
00:03:36,005 --> 00:03:39,467
So, ownership to usership

51
00:03:39,667 --> 00:03:44,492
and the second element of that
paradigm shift is the fact that

52
00:03:45,066 --> 00:03:49,778
we move away from separate
transportation systems

53
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:55,916
to mobility systems in the sense
that when you become a user

54
00:03:56,167 --> 00:04:01,117
you actually care much less
about which kind of transportation

55
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:05,882
mode you use and so ultimately
this leads to some sort of 

56
00:04:06,007 --> 00:04:08,794
mobility services.

57
00:04:10,134 --> 00:04:13,309
Let's now talk about the
steps towards transition

58
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:16,409
and we think there are 2 main steps.

59
00:04:16,609 --> 00:04:23,296
So traditionally there is already
quite a lot of improvement of

60
00:04:23,354 --> 00:04:28,842
existing transportation systems,
infrastructures and service

61
00:04:29,618 --> 00:04:34,680
but with the new data layer,
with the digitization,

62
00:04:35,707 --> 00:04:37,257
there are more improvements.

63
00:04:37,304 --> 00:04:42,229
The existing improvements
can be significantly enhanced

64
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:46,423
and that will be the first step
towards the transition.

65
00:04:46,735 --> 00:04:53,760
The second step will be the, so called,
shift pathway whereby things

66
00:04:53,812 --> 00:04:59,362
are done in terms of the paradigm
shift I mentioned before in terms of

67
00:04:59,725 --> 00:05:03,850
ownership to usership and in
terms of transportation mode

68
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:07,527
to mobility services

69
00:05:08,502 --> 00:05:14,402
and the next 2 sessions will
talk about these 2 steps

70
00:05:15,277 --> 00:05:21,589
which are conditions for making smart
urban mobility systems a reality.
