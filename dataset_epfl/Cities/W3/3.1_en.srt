00:00:05,384 --> 00:00:08,684
Welcome to the 3rd week of
our Smart City MOOC.

2
00:00:09,462 --> 00:00:12,987
In it, we will talk about
smart urban transportation systems

3
00:00:13,096 --> 00:00:15,246
and the block is structured as follows.

4
00:00:15,847 --> 00:00:19,985
First, we will conceptualize these
smart urban transportation systems

5
00:00:20,024 --> 00:00:22,724
lay out the key elements of it. 

6
00:00:22,994 --> 00:00:27,281
Then, Maxime will talk about what we
call the "improve" pathway

7
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:32,258
that namely the role that ICTs,
that digitalization plays

8
00:00:32,633 --> 00:00:35,808
in improving the current
transportation systems.

9
00:00:35,884 --> 00:00:39,222
This will be followed by an
interview with Siemens.

10
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,390
After that, Maxime will talk about
what we call the shift pathway

11
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:51,478
That is the use of the ICTs,
the role that digitalization plays

12
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:56,628
in making the transition to
smart urban transportation systems

13
00:00:56,942 --> 00:01:01,605
and this will be followed by an
interview with the RATP Group

14
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,727
Finally to conclude, we will lay out
the necessary conditions.

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,052
That is, what it takes at the
managerial and the policy level

16
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:17,602
in order to move towards
smart urban transportation systems.
