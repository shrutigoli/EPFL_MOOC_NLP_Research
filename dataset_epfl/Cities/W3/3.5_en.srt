1
00:00:05,904 --> 00:00:07,808
Hello, and welcome back 
to the course. 

2
00:00:08,016 --> 00:00:10,625
In this session, 
we will see how the information

3
00:00:10,825 --> 00:00:13,969
and communication technologies 
are enabling the development  

4
00:00:14,169 --> 00:00:16,686
of new mobility modes 
that are disrupting

5
00:00:16,886 --> 00:00:19,460
the traditional urban 
transportation landscape.

6
00:00:20,318 --> 00:00:24,009
And more generally, we will see 
how the ICTs are enabling

7
00:00:24,218 --> 00:00:27,185
the paradigm shift 
from traditional urban transportation

8
00:00:27,385 --> 00:00:29,785
to smart urban mobility. 

9
00:00:29,985 --> 00:00:32,574
We will do this along 
the three following steps.

10
00:00:32,774 --> 00:00:36,341
In the first time, we will discuss 
the different mobility services

11
00:00:36,541 --> 00:00:39,083
that are emerging 
thanks to digitalization. 

12
00:00:39,558 --> 00:00:42,270
Then we will talk about 
the potential of the ICTs

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:46,270
to go towards more integration 
in urban transportation systems.

14
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:50,188
Finally, we will see what this implies 
for  our infrastructure,

15
00:00:50,388 --> 00:00:52,208
data, and services layer. 

16
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,873
Thanks to 
the development of the ICTs, 

17
00:00:56,073 --> 00:00:59,377
and especially to 
geo- localization technologies,

18
00:00:59,577 --> 00:01:02,653
new mobility services, 
partly relying on mechanisms

19
00:01:02,849 --> 00:01:04,616
borrowed from the sharing economy

20
00:01:04,816 --> 00:01:06,426
have emerged in the last 10 years.

21
00:01:06,626 --> 00:01:09,498
For example, the information 
and communication technologies

22
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:13,768
have supported the development 
of car sharing schemes.

23
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:16,478
Indeed, you can now for example, 
use your cellphone

24
00:01:16,678 --> 00:01:19,269
to know where 
a car sharing station is located,

25
00:01:19,469 --> 00:01:23,613
book a car,  pay for it online, 
use it, and drop it

26
00:01:23,813 --> 00:01:25,748
at the next car sharing station. 

27
00:01:25,948 --> 00:01:29,535
car2go, DriveNow, 
for example, are among 

28
00:01:29,735 --> 00:01:31,449
the most well known 
car sharing company. 

29
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:35,073
Should you be using 
your own vehicle for a defined trip, 

30
00:01:35,273 --> 00:01:38,067
you can now decide 
to enter your trip origin 

31
00:01:38,267 --> 00:01:41,200
and destination, 
so people that are planning to do 

32
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:43,743
a similar trip 
than the one you're doing,

33
00:01:43,943 --> 00:01:46,369
can decide to join your ride. 

34
00:01:46,569 --> 00:01:49,503
This is called car pooling, 
and one of the most famous platform

35
00:01:49,703 --> 00:01:52,894
to do it, is provided by 
the French company BlaBlaCar.

36
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,245
Still thanks to geo-localization, 

37
00:01:56,445 --> 00:02:00,456
you can now use your smartphone 
to hail a ride anytime, anywhere. 

38
00:02:00,656 --> 00:02:03,355
This is call E-hailing  
that allows you to have access

39
00:02:03,555 --> 00:02:05,934
to mobility solutions 
in many different countries. 

40
00:02:06,134 --> 00:02:10,070
Uber or Lift are, for example, 
providing such services.

41
00:02:10,861 --> 00:02:13,571
One must also acknowledge 
the fact that some of these

42
00:02:13,759 --> 00:02:16,476
new hybrid mobility modes, 
as we call them, 

43
00:02:16,676 --> 00:02:18,895
might also become driverless
at one point.

44
00:02:19,095 --> 00:02:21,999
As we have already seen 
with Uber rolling out

45
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:25,981
driverless Uber services 
in Pittsburgh, United States.

46
00:02:28,646 --> 00:02:31,884
We are at the edge 
of a real paradigm shift

47
00:02:32,084 --> 00:02:35,125
in urban transportation system 
that is facilitated

48
00:02:35,325 --> 00:02:38,017
by information 
and communication technology.

49
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:42,661
These new ICT facilitated services 
are impacting

50
00:02:42,861 --> 00:02:44,996
public and private transport. 

51
00:02:45,196 --> 00:02:48,675
They affect the need 
for urban dwellers to own their own car,

52
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:51,911
as they make 
mobility solutions more accessible. 

53
00:02:52,832 --> 00:02:55,419
And they also impact 
public transportation providers

54
00:02:55,619 --> 00:02:58,699
that have, for example, 
in some case started to provide

55
00:02:58,899 --> 00:03:01,197
on-demand shuttles 
for the customers,

56
00:03:01,397 --> 00:03:04,337
such as the Kutsuplus services 
that was provided

57
00:03:04,537 --> 00:03:06,182
in Helsinki last year. 

58
00:03:06,382 --> 00:03:08,430
There is 
a real paradigm shift happening 

59
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:10,941
from transportation to mobility, 

60
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:14,843
and from car ownership 
to mobility usership.

61
00:03:15,743 --> 00:03:18,945
However, many of these 
new mobility modes are redundant. 

62
00:03:19,145 --> 00:03:23,294
And are complexifying
the mobility offers in urban systems,

63
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:26,933
calling for more integration 
within mobility modes,

64
00:03:27,133 --> 00:03:28,619
and across mobility mode. 

65
00:03:29,815 --> 00:03:32,950
All mobility modes 
are now producing data. 

66
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,616
So, it has now 
become possible to integrate

67
00:03:35,816 --> 00:03:37,965
these data under different schemes. 

68
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:41,834
The first scheme is known as 
Integrated Ticketing Systems

69
00:03:42,034 --> 00:03:44,945
that you might also know 
as smart card.

70
00:03:45,145 --> 00:03:48,788
There, the users use only 
one single ticketing system

71
00:03:48,988 --> 00:03:51,569
to access and pay 
for different mobility solutions.

72
00:03:51,769 --> 00:03:55,108
For example, in Seoul, South Korea, 
the T-money card

73
00:03:55,308 --> 00:03:58,709
is accepted on all buses, metros, 
and suburban trains

74
00:03:58,878 --> 00:04:00,309
of the transportation network.

75
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:05,170
But, it can also be accepted to pay 
in all taxis operating in Seoul.

76
00:04:06,468 --> 00:04:10,331
Thus integrating public 
and semi-private transport solutions. 

77
00:04:11,936 --> 00:04:14,191
 Integrated Mobility Platforms 
correspond to 

78
00:04:14,391 --> 00:04:16,768
more advanced form 
of transport integration

79
00:04:16,968 --> 00:04:19,968
facilitated by information
and communication technologies.

80
00:04:20,168 --> 00:04:24,386
With Integrated Mobility Platforms, 
users have access

81
00:04:24,586 --> 00:04:27,089
within one smartphone app
to information

82
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:29,263
from 
various transportation providers

83
00:04:29,463 --> 00:04:31,435
about the trip 
they are planning to do. 

84
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:34,951
Thus, they are able to know 
from different transportation providers

85
00:04:35,151 --> 00:04:38,516
proposing the trip they want to do,
how long the trip will take, 

86
00:04:38,716 --> 00:04:42,587
how expensive it will be,
and much carbon they will make. 

87
00:04:42,787 --> 00:04:45,330
They are not just able 
to have the information,

88
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,401
but also are able to book and pay 
for the chosen trip on the app,

89
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:53,036
independently of 
the mobility provider chosen.

90
00:04:53,236 --> 00:04:56,703
And to receive their tickets 
on their smartphones electronically,

91
00:04:56,903 --> 00:04:59,182
as well as their invoice. 

92
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:02,777
Such solutions tend to integrate
public transport solutions

93
00:05:02,964 --> 00:05:06,982
with more hybrid solutions 
such as E-hailing or car pooling, 

94
00:05:07,207 --> 00:05:10,372
or even human powered solution,
such as bike sharing. 

95
00:05:11,367 --> 00:05:13,774
The ultimate 
integrated mobility solution

96
00:05:13,974 --> 00:05:16,153
is known as 
the Mobility-as-a-Service,

97
00:05:16,353 --> 00:05:19,024
which is 
a mobility distribution model

98
00:05:19,224 --> 00:05:21,642
in which a customer's 
major transportation needs

99
00:05:21,842 --> 00:05:24,021
are made over one single interface. 

100
00:05:24,221 --> 00:05:26,766
And these 
interface mobility services  

101
00:05:26,975 --> 00:05:29,164
are bundled into monthly packages,

102
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:33,320
similar to mobile phone priced 
on package that you probably have. 

103
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:35,840
An easy way to understand
Mobility-as-a-Service

104
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:40,464
is to think about it as the Netflix
or the Spotify of transportation. 

105
00:05:40,664 --> 00:05:43,531
It's a platform.
You pay a monthly fee and have access

106
00:05:43,739 --> 00:05:46,950
to solutions and mobility services,
depending on the package

107
00:05:47,150 --> 00:05:49,284
you have selected and paid for.

108
00:05:50,402 --> 00:05:52,566
Even if not proved yet,
it's more and more agreed

109
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:56,364
going towards integration 
should improve the user experience. 

110
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:59,729
As it will make public transport
and hybrid transportation solutions

111
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:04,262
more attractive and more serious 
alternative to private car users. 

112
00:06:04,462 --> 00:06:08,115
By promoting more 
shared mobility solutions, 

113
00:06:08,315 --> 00:06:11,401
integrated mobility solutions
 have the potential

114
00:06:11,601 --> 00:06:14,844
to reduce congestion,
and make our transportation systems

115
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:17,757
more efficient, 
and ultimately more sustainable.

116
00:06:18,952 --> 00:06:21,567
Integrated mobility solutions 
contribute to the shift

117
00:06:21,767 --> 00:06:26,486
from legacy transportation system
to smart urban mobility systems.

118
00:06:27,161 --> 00:06:29,634
However, reaching such levels 
of integration  

119
00:06:29,893 --> 00:06:31,976
will have implications 
in our infrastructure,

120
00:06:32,176 --> 00:06:34,318
 data, and services layer. 

121
00:06:35,473 --> 00:06:39,150
In the infrastructure layer, 
financing is the big deal. 

122
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:41,871
New business model 
have to be developed 

123
00:06:42,071 --> 00:06:44,862
to warranty the quality 
of transportation services

124
00:06:45,062 --> 00:06:48,948
which translates in investments 
in the infrastructure layer. 

125
00:06:49,748 --> 00:06:52,616
Nowadays, many different 
mobility services

126
00:06:52,816 --> 00:06:58,583
are using transportation infra,
but these transportation infrastructures

127
00:06:58,783 --> 00:07:02,659
are still being financed in most 
of the cases by public authority. 

128
00:07:02,859 --> 00:07:05,448
So new mechanisms on how to finance

129
00:07:05,648 --> 00:07:08,438
transportation infrastructure
must be developed

130
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:12,975
to cope with the digitalization 
of urban transportation systems.

131
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:16,612
In the data layer, 
one must also make sure 

132
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:19,260
that all the data are integrable.

133
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:21,305
Among different
 transportation providers, 

134
00:07:21,497 --> 00:07:25,735
one must be sure  that the data 
is inter operable and exchangeable. 

135
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:28,610
Data from different 
mobility providers should reach 

136
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:31,445
the same level of quality 
and reliability

137
00:07:31,645 --> 00:07:34,645
and of course, be protected 
to warranty the security 

138
00:07:34,845 --> 00:07:37,056
of the customers. 

139
00:07:37,256 --> 00:07:41,691
At the service layer, coordination 
between mobility services providers

140
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:44,356
must be achieved 
to avoid redundancy. 

141
00:07:44,556 --> 00:07:47,840
To ensure complementarity
of the different transportation modes,

142
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,076
public authority must 
put regulations in place

143
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:54,565
as newcomers that 
are coming from digitalization

144
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:56,783
and traditional 
transportation providers, 

145
00:07:56,983 --> 00:08:00,050
are now sharing 
the exact same playground.

146
00:08:00,891 --> 00:08:03,091
Last but not least,
new business models 

147
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:05,692
have to be developed 
between platform operators

148
00:08:05,892 --> 00:08:08,736
and mobility service providers
to go towards

149
00:08:08,936 --> 00:08:12,220
the subscription formula,
as it is more and more proposed 

150
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,566
in the Mobility-as-a-Service model. 

151
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:18,573
In this session we have seen 
how the ICTs are enabling

152
00:08:18,773 --> 00:08:21,900
the development of new 
mobility modes that are disrupting

153
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:24,238
the traditional mobility landscape. 

154
00:08:24,438 --> 00:08:27,894
And how the ICTs 
can enable the paradigm shift

155
00:08:28,094 --> 00:08:31,451
from legacy urban 
transportation system
