1
00:00:05,061 --> 00:00:06,738
Welcome back.

2
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:09,545
In this last session

3
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:11,268
of the third block

4
00:00:11,431 --> 00:00:12,855
we will now talk about

5
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:16,183
the necessary conditions

6
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:19,392
towards smart urban mobility systems.

7
00:00:19,556 --> 00:00:21,219
Highlighting in particular 

8
00:00:21,374 --> 00:00:23,762
that main challenges for managers

9
00:00:23,926 --> 00:00:25,601
and policy-makers.

10
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:27,975
So let's first look

11
00:00:28,146 --> 00:00:30,034
at the challenges for managers.

12
00:00:30,217 --> 00:00:31,067
I mean typically

13
00:00:31,247 --> 00:00:32,659
those are challenges 

14
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:36,132
for urban transportation managers.

15
00:00:36,565 --> 00:00:38,115
And we have distinguished this

16
00:00:38,282 --> 00:00:41,132
along as a series of categories

17
00:00:41,289 --> 00:00:43,228
but the most important one

18
00:00:43,397 --> 00:00:45,934
a sort of the challenges in the area 

19
00:00:46,099 --> 00:00:47,674
of the infrastructure layer,

20
00:00:47,853 --> 00:00:48,803
the services layer

21
00:00:48,983 --> 00:00:50,245
and the data layer.

22
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:52,320
Now, the most important challenges

23
00:00:52,488 --> 00:00:54,738
at the infrastructure layer level

24
00:00:54,922 --> 00:00:58,246
are the questions of interconnection

25
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:00,080
of transportation modes.

26
00:01:00,259 --> 00:01:02,184
The different transportation modes

27
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:04,139
in light of mobility

28
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:06,862
as being the new kind of approach,

29
00:01:07,031 --> 00:01:08,320
the new kind of services.

30
00:01:08,499 --> 00:01:10,037
Managers need to pay

31
00:01:10,205 --> 00:01:11,606
much more attention

32
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,493
into the interconnection

33
00:01:13,657 --> 00:01:15,970
of the different transportation modes.

34
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:18,763
And also they need to pay attention

35
00:01:18,936 --> 00:01:22,274
to upgrading the infrastructures

36
00:01:22,444 --> 00:01:26,295
with the necessary ICT devices,

37
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,360
sensors, tools, so that

38
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:33,517
they can be made digital compatible.

39
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:34,914
So that the services

40
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:37,318
can actually be offered.

41
00:01:37,493 --> 00:01:39,530
On the services layers,

42
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:40,816
I think managers

43
00:01:40,984 --> 00:01:42,721
are particularly challenged

44
00:01:42,893 --> 00:01:45,518
to come up with new business models.

45
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:47,941
On the basis of this data

46
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:49,298
that are generated

47
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:50,620
it is important

48
00:01:50,787 --> 00:01:52,749
to find the business models

49
00:01:52,913 --> 00:01:53,950
that are sustainable

50
00:01:54,126 --> 00:01:55,226
 and that will work.

51
00:01:55,546 --> 00:01:57,659
And also on the services layer

52
00:01:57,827 --> 00:01:59,289
it is of course important

53
00:01:59,468 --> 00:02:02,132
that the users accept a new services

54
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,524
and that has very much to do

55
00:02:03,694 --> 00:02:05,269
with the digital divide.

56
00:02:05,438 --> 00:02:07,500
Not all types of user

57
00:02:07,661 --> 00:02:10,186
are equally adapt to dealing

58
00:02:10,344 --> 00:02:14,182
with a new digital mobility services.

59
00:02:14,381 --> 00:02:15,493
On the data layer

60
00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:17,347
the typical challenge

61
00:02:17,506 --> 00:02:19,193
pertains for managers,

62
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:21,991
for urban transportation managers

63
00:02:22,163 --> 00:02:24,662
pertains to data standards,

64
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:25,646
and protocols.

65
00:02:25,802 --> 00:02:27,777
So that the data that are generated

66
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:29,907
can actually be exchange

67
00:02:30,095 --> 00:02:33,820
and used later to meet

68
00:02:33,988 --> 00:02:35,300
make the services.

69
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:37,671
Another big challenge of course

70
00:02:37,841 --> 00:02:39,079
at the data layer

71
00:02:39,252 --> 00:02:40,765
is the security challenge,

72
00:02:40,926 --> 00:02:43,426
to make sure that this data

73
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,617
are not hacked

74
00:02:44,782 --> 00:02:48,107
and that there are no security breaches.

75
00:02:48,983 --> 00:02:51,796
Now, let's look at the challenges

76
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:53,254
for policy-makers,

77
00:02:53,426 --> 00:02:55,351
for urban policy-makers

78
00:02:55,524 --> 00:02:57,599
Again, the same distinctions

79
00:02:57,767 --> 00:02:59,980
but the focus is of course different 

80
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:01,640
and the infrastructure layer.

81
00:03:01,812 --> 00:03:03,550
I think policy-makers 

82
00:03:03,728 --> 00:03:05,141
are very much challenged

83
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:07,912
to find the necessary finances

84
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:09,878
for this infrastructures.

85
00:03:10,047 --> 00:03:13,072
This is not necessarily a question

86
00:03:13,232 --> 00:03:17,444
that is new but of course

87
00:03:17,595 --> 00:03:19,007
in the context

88
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:21,206
of the new mobility services

89
00:03:21,382 --> 00:03:24,295
it's very important to look

90
00:03:24,466 --> 00:03:26,891
at what needs to be finance

91
00:03:27,051 --> 00:03:28,376
and which infrastructures

92
00:03:28,544 --> 00:03:29,894
need to be finance.

93
00:03:30,072 --> 00:03:32,335
Then other policy-makers challenges here

94
00:03:32,493 --> 00:03:34,955
are the infrastructure development

95
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,792
which infrastructures to develop,

96
00:03:37,943 --> 00:03:40,431
what kind of infrastructures to develop

97
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:42,764
and that always in relationship

98
00:03:42,921 --> 00:03:44,271
to land use planning,

99
00:03:44,448 --> 00:03:45,597
where to develop.

100
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:47,040
And if one looks at

101
00:03:47,207 --> 00:03:48,394
the metropolitan level

102
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,541
it's the same kind of thing

103
00:03:50,696 --> 00:03:52,371
except that there are

104
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,041
multiple political authorities

105
00:03:56,212 --> 00:03:58,399
that need to plan and develop

106
00:03:58,573 --> 00:04:00,160
the infrastructures together

107
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:02,818
and plan the land use together.

108
00:04:03,112 --> 00:04:04,786
On the services layer,

109
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:07,815
the challenge here for policy-makers

110
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:09,657
is the coordination

111
00:04:09,804 --> 00:04:12,379
of the different actors involved.

112
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:14,507
If we go to mobility services

113
00:04:14,666 --> 00:04:16,254
There're many more actors

114
00:04:16,405 --> 00:04:18,593
to coordinate and that is often

115
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:20,319
 a political challenged

116
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:22,291
and then it's also of course

117
00:04:22,451 --> 00:04:24,113
the question of the regulation

118
00:04:24,269 --> 00:04:26,719
because the different actors

119
00:04:26,872 --> 00:04:27,984
operate under different

120
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:28,985
kind of roles.

121
00:04:29,157 --> 00:04:31,432
And there is no level playing field

122
00:04:31,594 --> 00:04:33,531
and therefore there is a big challenge

123
00:04:33,681 --> 00:04:35,968
for policy-makers to come up

124
00:04:36,141 --> 00:04:38,729
with regulations that actually allow

125
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:41,600
for mobility services.

126
00:04:42,264 --> 00:04:44,702
The same actually is true

127
00:04:44,878 --> 00:04:48,090
at the metropolitan level

128
00:04:48,275 --> 00:04:51,125
except that most typically regulation

129
00:04:51,294 --> 00:04:52,356
will not happen there

130
00:04:52,526 --> 00:04:54,051
but it's also a challenge

131
00:04:54,216 --> 00:04:56,716
 of coordinating the different actors.

132
00:04:57,496 --> 00:05:00,208
And on the data layer the challenge,

133
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:02,145
the main challenge for policy-makers

134
00:05:02,326 --> 00:05:05,250
pertains first to the whole financing

135
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,461
of the data infrastructure.

136
00:05:07,629 --> 00:05:10,229
There are all kind of investments

137
00:05:10,392 --> 00:05:11,554
that are necessary

138
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:13,857
to make this data platforms,

139
00:05:14,023 --> 00:05:16,435
to make them available,

140
00:05:16,602 --> 00:05:17,540
make them usable

141
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:19,814
and put them at the disposal

142
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:22,000
of the different operators.

143
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:24,255
Another political challenge

144
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:25,800
is the privacy challenge.

145
00:05:25,965 --> 00:05:28,590
How much privacy is necessary?

146
00:05:28,754 --> 00:05:30,841
And how much privacy

147
00:05:31,001 --> 00:05:33,826
do actually the citizens want?

148
00:05:35,444 --> 00:05:36,856
Then a further challenge

149
00:05:37,015 --> 00:05:38,890
pertains to political challenge,

150
00:05:39,043 --> 00:05:40,930
pertains to data policy,

151
00:05:41,091 --> 00:05:43,329
is data an infrastructure,

152
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:45,380
 is a data just a service,

153
00:05:45,557 --> 00:05:47,044
is data a product

154
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:48,565
and how to regulate

155
00:05:48,732 --> 00:05:50,857
these different data?

156
00:05:51,033 --> 00:05:53,958
How to regulate access to this data?

157
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:55,431
How to regulate ownership

158
00:05:55,584 --> 00:05:56,659
to this data?

159
00:05:56,828 --> 00:05:59,191
The same questions arise

160
00:05:59,353 --> 00:06:00,416
of course also

161
00:06:00,587 --> 00:06:02,125
at the metropolitan level.

162
00:06:02,855 --> 00:06:04,242
To conclude,

163
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:07,306
 in this block we have conceptualized

164
00:06:07,486 --> 00:06:10,248
smart urban transportation systems.

165
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:11,637
And we have showed

166
00:06:11,798 --> 00:06:14,486
how the ICTs, how digitalization

167
00:06:14,649 --> 00:06:17,812
can improve and can enable the shift

168
00:06:17,986 --> 00:06:19,561
towards such systems.

169
00:06:19,725 --> 00:06:21,275
We highlighted in particular

170
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:22,034
at the end

171
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:23,833
the challenges for managers,

172
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,102
urban transportation managers

173
00:06:26,257 --> 00:06:28,332
and policy-makers.

174
00:06:28,499 --> 00:06:30,699
Now, in the next two blocks

175
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:32,484
we will have take a much more

176
00:06:32,647 --> 00:06:35,635
in-depth look into the transition 

177
00:06:35,784 --> 00:06:37,684
