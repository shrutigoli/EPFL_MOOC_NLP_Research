1
00:00:05,565 --> 00:00:08,003
Hello, and welcome back
to the course.

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,335
My name is Maxime Audouin, and I am
a researcher here at EPFL.

3
00:00:13,015 --> 00:00:15,728
In this session, we will focus
on how the ICTs

4
00:00:15,928 --> 00:00:19,165
can help to improve urban
transportation systems,

5
00:00:19,365 --> 00:00:21,953
in terms of user experience
and safety.

6
00:00:22,621 --> 00:00:24,596
We will focus on 2 directions.

7
00:00:24,796 --> 00:00:28,508
Namely, the use of the information
and communication technologies

8
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,708
to monitor urban transportation
infrastructure

9
00:00:31,946 --> 00:00:34,146
and automated driving
vehicles.

10
00:00:34,602 --> 00:00:37,377
We will see that these 2 directions
have implications for

11
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:39,977
both public and private
transportation.

12
00:00:40,945 --> 00:00:44,320
The first area where 
digitalisation can help

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,520
is in the monitoring of urban
transportation systems.

14
00:00:48,336 --> 00:00:51,236
Indeed, by making the transportation
infrastructure

15
00:00:51,436 --> 00:00:53,874
equipped with data gathering 
devices

16
00:00:54,074 --> 00:00:57,886
such as video camera, speed cameras,
sensors for traffic detection.

17
00:00:58,249 --> 00:01:01,199
Such as infrared, laser, RFID,

18
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:04,678
as well as wired, and wireless
communication devices,

19
00:01:04,878 --> 00:01:07,391
we can now have 
a better understanding

20
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:11,191
of the behavior of urban
transportation systems.

21
00:01:11,391 --> 00:01:14,741
And thus, decide to optimize them
accordingly.

22
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:19,223
The use of the ICTs to monitor 
transportation infrastructure

23
00:01:19,423 --> 00:01:23,273
has direct implication, to begin in
the <i>Infrastructure Layer.</I>

24
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,409
Indeed, transportation and
infrastructure managers

25
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:29,896
now have to pay attention to
the integration of the legacy

26
00:01:30,096 --> 00:01:32,284
transportation infrastructure,

27
00:01:32,484 --> 00:01:34,984
with this new data infrastructure.

28
00:01:35,184 --> 00:01:38,021
There are also implications
in the Data layer.

29
00:01:38,221 --> 00:01:40,346
Transportation infrastructure
managers

30
00:01:40,546 --> 00:01:43,446
must pay attention to 
the reliability of the data.

31
00:01:43,646 --> 00:01:46,646
And whether they are complete
and holistic or not.

32
00:01:47,062 --> 00:01:48,887
Data coming from different channels

33
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,412
should also be easy
to standardize.

34
00:01:51,773 --> 00:01:54,848
Last but not least, one must be sure
that the data

35
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:57,261
is secure. That is to say that
the data

36
00:01:57,523 --> 00:01:59,911
doesn't end up in the wrong hands

37
00:02:00,538 --> 00:02:02,826
as they might be confidential data,

38
00:02:03,026 --> 00:02:05,426
and should not be misused.

39
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,626
To finish, there are implications
in the Services Layer.

40
00:02:09,046 --> 00:02:11,721
Thanks to the data gathered,
transportation providers

41
00:02:11,921 --> 00:02:14,008
can make their transportation services

42
00:02:14,246 --> 00:02:16,021
more accessible, performing, 

43
00:02:16,286 --> 00:02:18,486
and respond eventually
more adequately

44
00:02:18,686 --> 00:02:20,061
to the demand.

45
00:02:20,261 --> 00:02:23,261
Where as private car users can 
benefit from new services

46
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:24,774
such as ways

47
00:02:24,974 --> 00:02:27,336
allowing them to adapt their routes
when driving.

48
00:02:27,536 --> 00:02:30,749
For example, thanks to dynamic
route planners

49
00:02:30,949 --> 00:02:33,199
that are using real time data.

50
00:02:33,946 --> 00:02:36,796
The other direction that
is contributing to improve

51
00:02:37,033 --> 00:02:40,133
the experience of private and public
transportation users

52
00:02:40,455 --> 00:02:43,480
as well as the safety of urban
transportation systems

53
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,067
can be observed in the development
of self driving vehicles,

54
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:50,028
also known as
Automated Vehicles.

55
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,697
Most of the road accidents
nowadays

56
00:02:53,897 --> 00:02:56,160
are caused because of human errors.

57
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:58,972
And having machines
complete the driving task

58
00:02:59,172 --> 00:03:00,485
instead of humans,

59
00:03:00,685 --> 00:03:04,935
should it be for personal cars,
or public transport vehicles,

60
00:03:05,135 --> 00:03:08,447
could ultimately reduce the number
of accidents on the road,

61
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:11,260
increase the safety of
transportation systems,

62
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,885
and ultimately make our urban
transportation systems 

63
00:03:15,085 --> 00:03:16,735
more efficient.

64
00:03:17,144 --> 00:03:20,006
Another argument in favour of
automated vehicles

65
00:03:20,206 --> 00:03:23,206
is that it would allow people
to complete other tasks

66
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:24,606
than the driving task

67
00:03:24,806 --> 00:03:27,956
when using a vehicle to go
from one location to another.

68
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:31,456
That is to say, help them stop
wasting their time

69
00:03:31,656 --> 00:03:33,306
when commuting.

70
00:03:34,518 --> 00:03:37,905
Traditional vehicles, should they be
cars, shuttles, buses,

71
00:03:38,293 --> 00:03:41,243
are already producing important
amounts of data

72
00:03:41,443 --> 00:03:43,818
that you do not even think of.

73
00:03:44,212 --> 00:03:47,524
Think about the speed of a vehicle,
the direction it's headed,

74
00:03:47,724 --> 00:03:50,974
its location, its directions and
stability control,

75
00:03:51,174 --> 00:03:53,774
the brake status, the hours of
operation,

76
00:03:53,974 --> 00:03:55,187
the mileage.

77
00:03:55,387 --> 00:03:57,037
Thanks to the ICTs,

78
00:03:57,237 --> 00:04:01,724
these data can now be used to make
our vehicles more automated

79
00:04:01,924 --> 00:04:04,737
to go progressively towards
what is known as

80
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:07,049
Self Driving Vehicles.

81
00:04:07,249 --> 00:04:09,887
As agreed by The United States 
Department of Transportation,

82
00:04:10,087 --> 00:04:13,874
car automation can be divided
into 5 steps.

83
00:04:14,513 --> 00:04:16,013
Level 0, which is not
a step

84
00:04:16,213 --> 00:04:18,438
is known as the
No Automation Level.

85
00:04:18,638 --> 00:04:21,188
Level 1, which is the first step
is when the driver

86
00:04:21,388 --> 00:04:24,125
benefits from one driving
assistance system

87
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:26,638
such as braking systems
for example.

88
00:04:27,414 --> 00:04:29,976
Level 2, is where the river
benefits from

89
00:04:30,176 --> 00:04:32,376
at least 2 driving assistance 
systems.

90
00:04:32,576 --> 00:04:36,089
Fr example, cruise control, and 
braking assistance at the same time.

91
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:41,021
Whereas these 3 first levels are
enabled by automation mechanisms,

92
00:04:41,246 --> 00:04:43,384
the next 3 steps are enabled

93
00:04:43,584 --> 00:04:48,084
by a combination of automation and
ICT facilitated processing.

94
00:04:48,978 --> 00:04:51,478
Level 3 is defined as 
the conditional automation

95
00:04:51,678 --> 00:04:55,990
where the driving task is completed
by an automated driving system.

96
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:00,653
But it is expected that the driver
responds appropriately if needed.

97
00:05:00,903 --> 00:05:04,578
Such systems are currently being
used on highways

98
00:05:04,975 --> 00:05:06,900
with for example, what Tesla

99
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,875
is proposing in California 
in the United States,

100
00:05:10,075 --> 00:05:12,150
but not yet in urban systems

101
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:16,025
due to the high complexity 
of traffic in town.

102
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,250
Level 4 is defined as
the <i>High Automation</i>,

103
00:05:19,658 --> 00:05:22,545
which is the evolution of 
Level 3 into a stage

104
00:05:22,745 --> 00:05:25,495
where the human driver does not
even need to respond

105
00:05:25,695 --> 00:05:27,333
appropriately if needed.

106
00:05:27,533 --> 00:05:29,758
This is being developed, and
according to Tesla

107
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:32,958
still such functionalities
should be available

108
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:34,783
in 2018.

109
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:39,084
The last level of this
automation ladder,

110
00:05:39,304 --> 00:05:41,229
is the level 5, known as

111
00:05:41,429 --> 00:05:42,816
The Full Automation

112
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:45,016
where all aspects of driving

113
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:48,666
will be completed by driving
assistance systems

114
00:05:48,866 --> 00:05:51,029
including activities such
as parking.

115
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,988
Automated vehicles of Level 5

116
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,963
will not have any options for
human driving

117
00:05:57,325 --> 00:06:00,775
meaning they won't even be equipped
with steering wheel

118
00:06:00,975 --> 00:06:02,088
or controls.

119
00:06:02,971 --> 00:06:05,271
As we will see now,
self driving vehicles

120
00:06:05,471 --> 00:06:08,083
have implications on 
the infrastructure, the data, 

121
00:06:08,283 --> 00:06:09,696
and the service layer.

122
00:06:10,202 --> 00:06:12,477
In order to reach these levels
of automation,

123
00:06:12,677 --> 00:06:14,627
the transportation infrastructure

124
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:16,539
needs to be updated.

125
00:06:16,739 --> 00:06:20,164
First, vehicles need to be equipped
with data processing

126
00:06:20,364 --> 00:06:22,239
and communication technologies

127
00:06:22,439 --> 00:06:24,527
so they can communicate
with each other.

128
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:28,339
This is also known as the
vehicle to vehicle communication.

129
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:32,167
The infrastructure itself
needs to be able to

130
00:06:32,367 --> 00:06:34,505
be able to communicate with 
the vehicle as well.

131
00:06:34,872 --> 00:06:37,072
For example, speed limitations,
road signs,

132
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:39,309
traffic lights, need to be equipped

133
00:06:39,509 --> 00:06:43,484
in order to be able to send signals
to vehicles about the road conditions.

134
00:06:44,388 --> 00:06:48,301
Should we one day have automated
bus rapid transit systems,

135
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:51,938
bus stations will need to 
be equipped with data receiving

136
00:06:52,138 --> 00:06:54,051
and emitting devices

137
00:06:54,251 --> 00:06:57,738
to be able to communicate with
the driver-less buses fleet.

138
00:06:58,216 --> 00:06:59,916
Implications in the data layer

139
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:01,966
are also very important.

140
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:05,503
The data need to be standardized
between the different vehicles.

141
00:07:05,703 --> 00:07:07,853
For example between the bus
and cars,

142
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:10,903
and between vehicles from 
different manufacturers

143
00:07:11,103 --> 00:07:14,416
So they are still able to 
communicate with one another.

144
00:07:15,366 --> 00:07:17,791
Then comes the question of
who owns the data?

145
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:20,678
Is it the consumer?
Is it the vehicle manufacturer?

146
00:07:20,878 --> 00:07:22,516
Is it the public authority?

147
00:07:22,716 --> 00:07:24,166
Who are those owning the data?

148
00:07:24,753 --> 00:07:27,553
We must ask the question of
the pricing of the data.

149
00:07:27,778 --> 00:07:31,291
And to what extent the data can
be sold to 3rd party companies?

150
00:07:32,122 --> 00:07:35,009
Last but not least, the data
need to be secured.

151
00:07:35,209 --> 00:07:38,822
As you can imagine, misuse of 
self driving vehicle data

152
00:07:39,307 --> 00:07:40,982
could be highly dangerous.

153
00:07:41,182 --> 00:07:43,982
At the services layer, 
implications also exist.

154
00:07:44,182 --> 00:07:46,420
Indeed, in case of a road accident,

155
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,295
the question of who is
held accountable

156
00:07:48,629 --> 00:07:50,304
must be taken into account.

157
00:07:50,868 --> 00:07:52,805
Is it the car user
that is responsible?

158
00:07:53,005 --> 00:07:54,793
Or the transportation provider?

159
00:07:54,993 --> 00:07:56,568
The vehicle manufacturing
company?

160
00:07:56,768 --> 00:07:58,180
The insurance company?

161
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:00,949
And we also need to care about
the social acceptance

162
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:03,474
of driver-less vehicle technologies.

163
00:08:03,674 --> 00:08:07,286
That will not be the same among
different social classes

164
00:08:07,486 --> 00:08:08,549
or age groups.

165
00:08:08,749 --> 00:08:11,749
You might think about the social
acceptance of driver-less cars,

166
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:15,539
but the social acceptance of 
automated public transport

167
00:08:15,739 --> 00:08:18,064
should be considered with
the same importance.

168
00:08:18,561 --> 00:08:20,799
Last but not least, driver-less
vehicles

169
00:08:20,999 --> 00:08:23,149
will have institutional implications.

170
00:08:23,464 --> 00:08:25,064
For example,
public authorities

171
00:08:25,264 --> 00:08:27,864
might need to make the driving
code evolve.

172
00:08:28,064 --> 00:08:30,789
Or one can wonder if people will
even need to own a kind of

173
00:08:30,989 --> 00:08:32,602
driving license...

174
00:08:32,802 --> 00:08:36,002
anymore to be able to use
a driver-less vehicle?

175
00:08:36,625 --> 00:08:39,587
In this session, we have seen
two main directions

176
00:08:39,787 --> 00:08:42,725
enabled by the ICTs 
to address the safety

177
00:08:42,925 --> 00:08:44,625
and user experience challenge

178
00:08:44,812 --> 00:08:46,800
in private and public transport.

179
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,312
And the implications these 2
directions have in the infrastructure,

180
00:08:50,512 --> 00:08:52,875
the data, and the services layer.

181
00:08:53,075 --> 00:08:55,975
We will now hear from
our expert Steffen Schaefer

182
00:08:56,175 --> 00:08:57,362
from Siemens,

183
00:08:57,562 --> 00:08:59,962
who will explain to us what
the main drivers

184
00:09:00,162 --> 00:09:03,675
behind the emergence of smart
urban mobility systems are.

185
00:09:04,302 --> 00:09:05,640
Stay tuned.
