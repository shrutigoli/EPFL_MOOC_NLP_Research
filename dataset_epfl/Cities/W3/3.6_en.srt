1
00:00:05,942 --> 00:00:07,539
Welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:07,739 --> 00:00:10,739
I have the pleasure of receiving
Nathalie Leboucher,

3
00:00:10,939 --> 00:00:15,392
Executive Vice President Innovation Strategy
and Business Development

4
00:00:15,592 --> 00:00:20,262
from the RATP Group in France,
a public transport operator.

5
00:00:20,667 --> 00:00:25,719
Before, she was a head of Smart City at Orange,
the French telecom operator.

6
00:00:25,919 --> 00:00:28,358
Thank you, Nathalie, for being here.

7
00:00:28,558 --> 00:00:32,191
Hello. This is a real pleasure
to be here at EPFL.

8
00:00:32,391 --> 00:00:35,586
Thank you. So the 1st question
I would like to ask you is

9
00:00:35,786 --> 00:00:39,906
what are the main trends you see
in urban mobility?

10
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:45,122
Today, we can see that 3 major trends
are reshaping urban mobility

11
00:00:45,322 --> 00:00:49,017
and accelerating the emergence
of smart mobility solutions.

12
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:54,767
First, there is increasing pressure
on urban mobility systems.

13
00:00:54,967 --> 00:01:02,125
By 2030, more than 60% of the world's
population will live in urban areas.

14
00:01:02,325 --> 00:01:08,231
This will lead to a massive increase
in daily individual journeys,

15
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:12,490
representing a new challenge
for urban mobility systems.

16
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:17,753
Other factors put urban mobility
systems under pressure,

17
00:01:17,953 --> 00:01:20,389
such as financial sustainability,

18
00:01:20,589 --> 00:01:22,824
environmental challenges,

19
00:01:23,024 --> 00:01:25,206
and infrastructure capacity.

20
00:01:26,626 --> 00:01:32,279
Second, we observe major shifts
in city dwellers' habits and needs.

21
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,302
Here are a few examples:

22
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:39,803
Consumers want on demand,
customized solutions to their daily needs.

23
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:43,136
They look for the best value
for the money.

24
00:01:43,336 --> 00:01:48,640
More and more customers prefer
a pay as you use system.

25
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,931
They expect to have access
to additional services.

26
00:01:53,131 --> 00:01:55,088
And last, but not least,

27
00:01:55,288 --> 00:02:00,936
they want to be able to choose within
their large range of transport solutions

28
00:02:01,136 --> 00:02:05,405
and get recommendations at each step
of their user experience.

29
00:02:06,662 --> 00:02:12,294
And, finally, we are in the middle
of a major digital revolution.

30
00:02:12,494 --> 00:02:16,187
There are some recent digital technologies

31
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:20,757
that offer a huge field of possibilities
for the future of urban mobility:

32
00:02:20,957 --> 00:02:24,895
big data, machine learning,
the Internet of Things,

33
00:02:25,095 --> 00:02:28,095
the user experience
and user interface design,

34
00:02:28,295 --> 00:02:31,080
open data and blockchain technologies,

35
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,460
just to name a few.

36
00:02:33,694 --> 00:02:35,520
Good. Now 2nd question.

37
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,248
What are the main models emerging
in urban public transport?

38
00:02:40,448 --> 00:02:42,828
Well, Matthias,

39
00:02:43,028 --> 00:02:48,459
we foresee 6 main categories of emerging
business models in public transport.

40
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:52,065
Thanks to the internet revolution,

41
00:02:52,265 --> 00:02:58,597
intermediation platforms allow direct transactions
between service providers and users.

42
00:02:58,797 --> 00:03:02,491
The revenue model is a commission
on each transaction,

43
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:06,577
and we all know Uber, BlaBlaCar,
and Booking.com.

44
00:03:06,777 --> 00:03:12,518
Pay as you use models are defining
a new a paradigm.

45
00:03:12,718 --> 00:03:16,200
There is a shift from owning
a product or an asset

46
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,202
to using a service.

47
00:03:18,402 --> 00:03:20,263
For the transport sector,

48
00:03:20,463 --> 00:03:24,408
we are seeing newcomers in car-sharing,
bike, and scooter services.

49
00:03:24,608 --> 00:03:29,281
Consumers pay for monthly fees
and according to usage.

50
00:03:31,026 --> 00:03:34,936
Device Centric models
are based on consumers

51
00:03:35,136 --> 00:03:37,385
devoted to a top-of-the-line
innovative brand,

52
00:03:37,585 --> 00:03:39,292
such as Apple or Tesla.

53
00:03:39,492 --> 00:03:43,925
The primary revenue source
is the device itself.

54
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:48,919
Additional revenues comes from paying for services
within the core system.

55
00:03:50,235 --> 00:03:57,189
Low Cost models focus on the key expectations
of clients for the best price.

56
00:03:57,389 --> 00:04:02,509
In this case, revenues come
from core service prices

57
00:04:02,709 --> 00:04:05,824
and extra charges for additional services.

58
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,274
Data Centric models, now, are based
on process data.

59
00:04:11,474 --> 00:04:16,424
They generally provide customers
with free high-quality services

60
00:04:16,624 --> 00:04:21,100
and, in exchange, gather all data
produced by their use.

61
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,108
If it's free, then you know that
you are the product.

62
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:31,587
Most developed centric models,
for example Google,

63
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:37,171
which is probably the best example with free
services along the whole mobility value chain,

64
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:42,125
with maps, live transit, Waze, Google Wallet,
Google Flight, and so on.

65
00:04:42,325 --> 00:04:48,175
The latest, and most revolutionary
business model to emerge

66
00:04:48,375 --> 00:04:53,892
is decentralized services on platforms
using blockchain technologies.

67
00:04:54,092 --> 00:05:01,224
Decentralized services are emerging models
with no proven pattern of success at this stage,

68
00:05:01,424 --> 00:05:07,723
but if they do succeed, they could be
a major revolution in the transport sector.

69
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:12,536
Imagine this as Uberization of Uber,

70
00:05:12,736 --> 00:05:16,622
with companies such as Arcade City
or LaZooz.

71
00:05:19,298 --> 00:05:21,335
These emerging business models

72
00:05:21,535 --> 00:05:27,449
are disrupting the urban mobility ecosystem
as we know it.

73
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:31,269
They challenge the whole
public transport value chain.

74
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:37,262
They are inventing smarter ways
to meet urban mobility infrastructure challenges.

75
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:43,280
Provide city dwellers with customized,
on demand mobility solutions.

76
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:46,985
And develop green mobility solutions.

77
00:05:47,185 --> 00:05:51,216
New players enter the transport
value chain

78
00:05:51,416 --> 00:05:56,462
through customer-related activities,
information, and sales.

79
00:05:56,662 --> 00:06:00,791
They invest, massively, in customer acquisition,

80
00:06:00,991 --> 00:06:05,031
where traditional players,
such as RATP Group,

81
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:08,045
invest heavily in infrastructure.

82
00:06:08,245 --> 00:06:09,827
And now to the 3rd question:

83
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:13,850
So what main strategies do you see
of legacy operators

84
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:15,808
to adapt to this new environment?

85
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:20,316
The emergence of innovative,
smart mobility solutions

86
00:06:20,516 --> 00:06:24,948
represents both a huge opportunity
and a huge challenge

87
00:06:25,148 --> 00:06:27,497
for legacy transport actors.

88
00:06:27,697 --> 00:06:33,053
Legacy transport operators,
such as RATP Group,

89
00:06:33,253 --> 00:06:37,880
are facing stiff competition
from 4 different directions:

90
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:41,461
market deregulation on core networks,

91
00:06:41,661 --> 00:06:46,182
urban mobility solutions now being
offered by car makers,

92
00:06:46,382 --> 00:06:53,398
smart mobility and disruptive solutions
now being offered by digital actors,

93
00:06:53,598 --> 00:06:57,871
both major internet players and start-ups.

94
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:02,036
To adapt to this new environment,

95
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:09,112
legacy transport actors have to strive
for excellence in their core business.

96
00:07:09,312 --> 00:07:13,710
Improve and deepen knowledge
of their customers

97
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,234
to enhance user experience.

98
00:07:16,434 --> 00:07:22,643
And develop a full mobility ecosystem
based on 2 elements:

99
00:07:22,843 --> 00:07:26,185
expand the range of mobility solutions

100
00:07:26,385 --> 00:07:28,823
and offer additional services.

101
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:33,350
Three levels are vital to success.

102
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:40,097
The 1st is to implement a digital
transformation plan.

103
00:07:40,297 --> 00:07:45,265
At RATP, our plan is based on 4 pillars:

104
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,465
customer experience,
employee experience,

105
00:07:48,665 --> 00:07:53,616
operational performance,
thanks to big data and IoT,

106
00:07:53,816 --> 00:07:56,489
and environmental performance.

107
00:07:56,689 --> 00:08:01,033
The 2nd level is to accelerate innovation.

108
00:08:01,233 --> 00:08:05,151
In the past, legacy transport operators

109
00:08:05,351 --> 00:08:09,607
have mainly focused on incremental
and technical innovation.

110
00:08:09,807 --> 00:08:13,623
Their aim was to improve their
existing network

111
00:08:13,823 --> 00:08:15,637
and operational performance.

112
00:08:15,837 --> 00:08:20,335
Today, they need to add market innovation

113
00:08:20,535 --> 00:08:23,124
and disruptive innovation
to the equation.

114
00:08:23,324 --> 00:08:26,384
Let me give you a few examples
of what I mean.

115
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:31,250
We need to develop innovation capacity

116
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,578
through specialized experts and labs

117
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:37,778
and launch major innovation programs,

118
00:08:37,978 --> 00:08:42,095
such as 3-D printing, robots,
energy storage, drones,

119
00:08:42,295 --> 00:08:43,733
Silver Economy, and so forth.

120
00:08:45,002 --> 00:08:50,023
We need to increase agility
and speed of execution.

121
00:08:50,223 --> 00:08:54,108
Focus on business driven innovation,

122
00:08:54,308 --> 00:08:59,606
and promote a culture of innovation
throughout the company.

123
00:08:59,806 --> 00:09:02,253
New business models and partnerships

124
00:09:02,453 --> 00:09:05,586
are the 3rd, and final, level to success.

125
00:09:05,786 --> 00:09:09,789
Legacy operators must enhance visibility

126
00:09:09,989 --> 00:09:12,361
in the urban mobility ecosystem

127
00:09:12,561 --> 00:09:16,461
by participating in major tech
entrance port events.

128
00:09:16,661 --> 00:09:21,574
They need to build partnerships
with both large groups and startups.

129
00:09:22,939 --> 00:09:26,823
They need to develop M&A investment
capacity

130
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:30,023
for early stage, or development stage,
companies.

131
00:09:31,572 --> 00:09:35,965
From all that you said, what would be
the main message to our participants?

132
00:09:36,165 --> 00:09:38,875
Well, from what I've just shown you,

133
00:09:39,075 --> 00:09:43,727
it is clear that we live in a radically changing
urban mobility context.

134
00:09:43,927 --> 00:09:46,648
Thanks to the digitalization,

135
00:09:46,848 --> 00:09:51,446
we have exciting opportunities
to better serve our clients.

136
00:09:51,646 --> 00:09:53,425
Thank you very much, Nathalie.

137
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,870
Thank you.
