1
00:00:04,994 --> 00:00:06,964
Welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:07,139 --> 00:00:09,651
It is my pleasure to discuss today

3
00:00:09,751 --> 00:00:11,125
with Steffen Schaeffer.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,885
He is a senior principal

5
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:14,780
of mobility management

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:16,580
at Siemens in Munich.

7
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:18,055
And maybe, Steffen,

8
00:00:18,255 --> 00:00:20,856
you can give us a little bit
of your background.

9
00:00:20,918 --> 00:00:22,729
Thank you, Matthias,
for inviting me.

10
00:00:22,854 --> 00:00:23,951
I'm glad to be here.

11
00:00:24,151 --> 00:00:25,706
I have been working

12
00:00:25,906 --> 00:00:27,077
for 15 years now

13
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:29,633
 on mobile internet 
and sensor network solution,

14
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,379
what today is called 
the internet of things.

15
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,415
I've been at IBM for many years,

16
00:00:37,615 --> 00:00:42,779
and have been starting with 
the smart city solutions in 2010,

17
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:46,061
when IBM launched 
the Smarter City campaign.

18
00:00:46,261 --> 00:00:48,090
Three years ago I joined Siemens,

19
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:49,737
and I'm now responsible

20
00:00:49,937 --> 00:00:52,937
for innovative digital 
mobility solutions.

21
00:00:53,137 --> 00:00:54,122
Okay.

22
00:00:54,322 --> 00:00:56,018
So you have a lot of experience

23
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:58,433
and if you look 10 years
ahead from now

24
00:00:58,495 --> 00:00:59,616
in which direction

25
00:00:59,753 --> 00:01:02,753
are the smart urban
mobility systems going?

26
00:01:03,428 --> 00:01:05,266
Even in 10 years from now,

27
00:01:05,466 --> 00:01:06,992
satisfying mobility needs

28
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:10,055
for rapidly growing 
population in cities

29
00:01:10,255 --> 00:01:12,754
will remain one of the key issues

30
00:01:12,954 --> 00:01:15,102
in urban infrastructure management.

31
00:01:15,302 --> 00:01:16,376
Of course,

32
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:19,409
the privately owned cars we know it

33
00:01:19,609 --> 00:01:21,781
will still be around in 10 years.

34
00:01:21,981 --> 00:01:24,920
But to a much lesser extent.

35
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,647
With the rise 
of self-driving vehicles,

36
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:31,565
new mobility services,

37
00:01:31,765 --> 00:01:33,754
and the sharing economy,

38
00:01:33,954 --> 00:01:36,161
there will be significant change

39
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,411
in urban mobility.

40
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:39,395
Modern information technologies,

41
00:01:39,595 --> 00:01:42,886
or what is called digitalization,

42
00:01:43,086 --> 00:01:44,687
are already enabling

43
00:01:44,887 --> 00:01:46,324
new transport modes,

44
00:01:46,524 --> 00:01:48,344
and are changing existing ones

45
00:01:48,544 --> 00:01:49,992
very rapidly.

46
00:01:50,055 --> 00:01:52,064
We see examples in this

47
00:01:52,264 --> 00:01:55,159
in for example, free floating cars

48
00:01:55,359 --> 00:01:57,613
that are paid by the minute,

49
00:01:57,813 --> 00:01:59,674
and can be dropped anywhere.

50
00:01:59,874 --> 00:02:03,752
The have become very popular

51
00:02:03,952 --> 00:02:06,917
in Germany and some US cities.

52
00:02:07,117 --> 00:02:10,905
Bike sharing are normally used

53
00:02:11,042 --> 00:02:12,236
through apps

54
00:02:12,436 --> 00:02:15,053
and with information technologies.

55
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:18,104
Taxi apps or limo services

56
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:21,747
have caused a lot of discussion

57
00:02:21,947 --> 00:02:25,081
and are challenging 
the existing taxi landscape.

58
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:27,907
As a last example,

59
00:02:28,107 --> 00:02:30,955
Demand Responsive Transport (DRT),

60
00:02:31,155 --> 00:02:32,717
is now an interesting new mode

61
00:02:32,917 --> 00:02:36,702
that replaces the traditional 
shared hail service

62
00:02:36,902 --> 00:02:39,179
by leveraging today's technologies.

63
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,771
All of them are complementing

64
00:02:41,971 --> 00:02:43,635
existing public transport

65
00:02:43,835 --> 00:02:45,252
at least in the midterm.

66
00:02:45,452 --> 00:02:48,506
With all these 
new transport modes, though,

67
00:02:48,706 --> 00:02:50,191
it will be important

68
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:53,391
to make intermodal journeys
seamless to the traveller,

69
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,083
in the sense that

70
00:02:55,283 --> 00:02:57,222
it is easy to transition

71
00:02:57,422 --> 00:02:59,275
from one transport mode
to the other.

72
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:01,168
For example,

73
00:03:01,493 --> 00:03:03,277
schedules are synchronized,

74
00:03:03,477 --> 00:03:06,572
or the information
about when people arrive.

75
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:10,559
Ticketing schemes 
and payments are integrated.

76
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:12,190
And so forth.

77
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:13,985
Okay. Thank you.

78
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:16,325
Now how does automatization

79
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:18,121
play into the evolution

80
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:19,965
of smart urban mobility?

81
00:03:20,578 --> 00:03:22,235
This is a great question.

82
00:03:24,328 --> 00:03:25,904
Automation in mobility

83
00:03:26,104 --> 00:03:29,277
will certainly become a reality

84
00:03:29,477 --> 00:03:30,654
also in cities.

85
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:32,305
I personally can see 

86
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,840
two potential scenarios,

87
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,986
and reality might

88
00:03:37,186 --> 00:03:40,186
well lie in between the two.

89
00:03:40,286 --> 00:03:42,371
First scenario, public transport

90
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:44,357
such as urban rail, 

91
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:46,242
underground or light rail trains,

92
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:50,278
will remain the key transport mode

93
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,337
in cities.

94
00:03:51,537 --> 00:03:55,203
Basically forming 
transportation backbone.

95
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:57,836
Where such public 
transport infrastructure

96
00:03:57,911 --> 00:03:59,161
has been implemented

97
00:03:59,236 --> 00:04:01,547
it will stay and remain

98
00:04:01,747 --> 00:04:03,971
very efficient means of transport.

99
00:04:05,033 --> 00:04:08,033
In complementing this first scenario

100
00:04:08,233 --> 00:04:10,165
there can be self-driving vehicles

101
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:15,060
that will offer 
first and last mile transport

102
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,718
in intermodal trips.

103
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,918
And thus complement and strengthen

104
00:04:20,118 --> 00:04:21,899
rail bound public transport.

105
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:24,124
In the second scenario

106
00:04:24,249 --> 00:04:25,544
self-driving vehicles 

107
00:04:25,631 --> 00:04:27,932
may offer door to door services,

108
00:04:28,132 --> 00:04:29,710
at least within a city.

109
00:04:29,823 --> 00:04:30,954
They could basically

110
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,890
compete against mass-transit.

111
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:36,162
Due to self-driving capabilities,

112
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:37,914
they wrote as 

113
00:04:37,977 --> 00:04:40,180
a relatively inexpensive 
infrastructure,

114
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:41,845
can be used intelligently,

115
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:45,045
so that traffic jams are avoided.

116
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:46,343
Either way,

117
00:04:46,543 --> 00:04:48,124
self-driving vehicles

118
00:04:48,324 --> 00:04:50,861
will be more intensely used

119
00:04:51,061 --> 00:04:52,266
than today's cars.

120
00:04:52,466 --> 00:04:53,509
They will be

121
00:04:53,597 --> 00:04:55,211
almost constantly on the roads

122
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:57,410
for transporting 
passengers and goods,

123
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,003
and if they need to park

124
00:04:59,203 --> 00:05:00,708
they will park themselves.

125
00:05:00,908 --> 00:05:02,347
So as another effect

126
00:05:02,547 --> 00:05:05,761
less parking infrastructure
will be needed.

127
00:05:06,211 --> 00:05:08,842
So what are the main drivers

128
00:05:09,042 --> 00:05:12,137
toward smart urban mobility systems?

129
00:05:12,337 --> 00:05:13,382
I see

130
00:05:13,582 --> 00:05:17,413
primarily technical
and institutional drivers.

131
00:05:17,613 --> 00:05:20,613
Let's start with the technical side.

132
00:05:20,813 --> 00:05:24,017
Let's look at 
what is behind digitalization?

133
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:27,528
What does it mean 
for mobility in cities?

134
00:05:27,728 --> 00:05:31,729
Let's look at 
the internet of things,

135
00:05:31,767 --> 00:05:32,473
for example.

136
00:05:32,673 --> 00:05:35,748
In mobility, it means
connected vehicles.

137
00:05:35,948 --> 00:05:39,650
Maybe even, of course, 
cars and buses and so.

138
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:40,949
Maybe even bikes.

139
00:05:41,149 --> 00:05:44,705
It could mean traffic lights

140
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:46,747
that signal to cars

141
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:48,839
the remaining red and green faces

142
00:05:49,914 --> 00:05:52,948
Mobile internet and smartphones

143
00:05:53,148 --> 00:05:54,998
are another technology

144
00:05:55,198 --> 00:05:57,745
that are key drivers.

145
00:05:57,945 --> 00:05:59,414
For example,

146
00:05:59,614 --> 00:06:01,656
people are able to locate themselves

147
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:04,779
on the map and find 
mobility services around them,

148
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,477
and purchase, for example,
public transport tickets

149
00:06:08,677 --> 00:06:09,686
 on the spot.

150
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,450
Thirdly,

151
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,180
cloud plays an important role

152
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,547
because now computing resources

153
00:06:15,747 --> 00:06:18,064
can be provided

154
00:06:18,264 --> 00:06:21,264
in a very flexible way.

155
00:06:21,352 --> 00:06:22,829
For example, you can adapt

156
00:06:22,979 --> 00:06:26,227
the size of the computing resources

157
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:28,169
to the traffic pattern.

158
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:31,647
That there will be more 
computing resources needed

159
00:06:31,847 --> 00:06:34,647
in morning and evening peak hours

160
00:06:34,847 --> 00:06:36,489
than during the night

161
00:06:36,689 --> 00:06:38,534
And fourthly,

162
00:06:38,734 --> 00:06:42,700
artificial intelligence 
is a really important technology.

163
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:47,384
Because it is essential 
for self-driving cars.

164
00:06:47,584 --> 00:06:49,005
And it can also help offer

165
00:06:49,205 --> 00:06:50,774
improving coordination

166
00:06:50,874 --> 00:06:53,231
of complex transportation networks.

167
00:06:53,844 --> 00:06:57,219
And besides these 
information technologies,

168
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:58,846
there are also technologies,

169
00:06:59,046 --> 00:07:02,046
other technologies that are changing

170
00:07:02,246 --> 00:07:05,055
better and cheaper batteries,
for example.

171
00:07:05,668 --> 00:07:08,158
And how about 
the institutional drivers?

172
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:10,958
Oh that is a really
important point.

173
00:07:12,297 --> 00:07:15,125
A suitable framework
needs to be brought in place

174
00:07:15,325 --> 00:07:17,217
to make this all work.

175
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:20,120
And to fully utilize

176
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,055
these new technologies

177
00:07:22,255 --> 00:07:24,966
by also keeping or creating

178
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,478
a level plane field.

179
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:28,877
I can see more

180
00:07:29,077 --> 00:07:31,740
private mobility providers

181
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:36,061
emerging beside 
the public transport operators,

182
00:07:36,261 --> 00:07:38,762
to a degree that citizens

183
00:07:38,962 --> 00:07:42,261
are offering rides,

184
00:07:42,461 --> 00:07:44,348
sharing their cars, 

185
00:07:44,548 --> 00:07:47,493
similar to a public service.

186
00:07:47,693 --> 00:07:51,722
And when Uber entered the market.

187
00:07:51,922 --> 00:07:55,483
It gained a certain attraction
and popularity

188
00:07:55,683 --> 00:07:57,005
amongst the citizens.

189
00:07:57,205 --> 00:08:00,134
But the city governments 
and taxi companies

190
00:08:00,334 --> 00:08:03,218
first didn't know
what to do with it.

191
00:08:03,418 --> 00:08:06,014
But in the mean time now,

192
00:08:06,214 --> 00:08:08,634
national and city governments

193
00:08:08,834 --> 00:08:11,148
are bringing the right 
regulations in place

194
00:08:11,348 --> 00:08:14,389
so the new transport modes

195
00:08:14,589 --> 00:08:17,958
and these new services can be used.

196
00:08:18,158 --> 00:08:20,626
Car sharing is another example.

197
00:08:20,826 --> 00:08:23,346
Think how,

198
00:08:23,546 --> 00:08:25,345
 and under what circumstances

199
00:08:25,545 --> 00:08:27,397
should car sharing provider

200
00:08:27,597 --> 00:08:30,368
be allowed to park their fleet,

201
00:08:30,568 --> 00:08:33,568
which can be a few 
hundred cars in a city.

202
00:08:33,768 --> 00:08:35,647
And what circumstances

203
00:08:35,718 --> 00:08:37,491
are they allowed to park their cars

204
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:39,189
on public roads.

205
00:08:39,389 --> 00:08:42,773
That is the framework
that needs to be set up

206
00:08:42,973 --> 00:08:44,739
by the governments.

207
00:08:48,697 --> 00:08:50,825
As another example in the US,

208
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,286
we see an interesting trend

209
00:08:52,486 --> 00:08:53,936
that companies

210
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:56,421
are trying to impact

211
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:59,269
the mobility behavior
of their employees.

212
00:08:59,469 --> 00:09:03,174
They are charging parking fees,

213
00:09:03,374 --> 00:09:05,032
fees for parking the car

214
00:09:05,128 --> 00:09:06,686
at the corporate sites

215
00:09:06,886 --> 00:09:09,076
and take this money to subsidize

216
00:09:09,229 --> 00:09:11,792
alternative modes of transport

217
00:09:11,992 --> 00:09:15,614
for coming with your private car.

218
00:09:15,814 --> 00:09:17,892
So there, 

219
00:09:18,092 --> 00:09:19,384
you can see that

220
00:09:19,584 --> 00:09:21,674
in the absence

221
00:09:21,874 --> 00:09:25,513
of a good institutional 
framework of regulations,

222
00:09:25,713 --> 00:09:28,081
even private companies
are going in this way.

223
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:30,355
And lastly,

224
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,019
look at the two scenarios

225
00:09:32,219 --> 00:09:33,521
I have painted before

226
00:09:33,721 --> 00:09:35,739
on the self-driving vehicles.

227
00:09:37,419 --> 00:09:42,525
What is, ah, which scenarios 
will emerge in your city?

228
00:09:42,725 --> 00:09:44,422
It's not a technical question.

229
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:47,666
And maybe also not a commercial one.

230
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:51,569
It strongly depends on 
the regulations you're setting.

231
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,176
Ya, I think that's a really
 clear conclusion.

232
00:09:55,376 --> 00:09:57,324
The role of regulations
in all of this.

233
00:09:57,536 --> 00:09:58,769
Thank you so much, Steffen,

234
00:09:58,969 --> 00:10:00,096
for your insights

235
00:10:00,296 --> 00:10:02,633
on smart urban mobility systems.

236
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,510
It's been a real pleasure, Matthias,

237
00:10:04,597 --> 00:10:06,112
thanks for inviting me.
