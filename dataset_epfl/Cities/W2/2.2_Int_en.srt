1
00:00:06,325 --> 00:00:08,387
Welcome back to the course. 

2
00:00:08,582 --> 00:00:11,907
It is my pleasure today 
to discuss with Yves Corrodi.

3
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:15,725
He's the Head of Strategy 
of IWB

4
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:20,249
which stands for the Utility
of the Region of Basel. 

5
00:00:20,447 --> 00:00:25,496
This utility is original 
in the sense that it is integrated.

6
00:00:25,705 --> 00:00:30,704
It covers several infrastructures, 
water, telecommunications, 

7
00:00:30,916 --> 00:00:34,916
district heating
and of course, electricity.

8
00:00:35,129 --> 00:00:40,005
Another key feature of this utility
is that they source 100%

9
00:00:40,194 --> 00:00:43,082
of their electricity 
from renewables. 

10
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:45,690
So welcome Yves . 

11
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:47,639
Thank you for the invitation. 

12
00:00:47,852 --> 00:00:53,715
So, as an integrated utility, 
what kind of links do you make?

13
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,532
Or do you foresee between 
the electricity, 

14
00:00:57,774 --> 00:01:01,474
the smart electricity system
and the other infrastructure,

15
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:03,776
 urban infrastructure systems?

16
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,717
There are a lot of interference
within a lot of dimensions.

17
00:01:08,903 --> 00:01:11,578
Regarding a technical dimension,

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:15,163
There are, phenomenally 
you can observe

19
00:01:15,364 --> 00:01:19,426
within the electric grid itself 
such as an increase of PV, 

20
00:01:19,608 --> 00:01:23,646
local PV Systems, but also between 
other infrastructures 

21
00:01:23,835 --> 00:01:27,885
such as heat pumps, 
as a new heating source, 

22
00:01:28,071 --> 00:01:31,158
or storage systems 
of different medias, 

23
00:01:31,361 --> 00:01:35,261
or, are as example, 
electrical mobility. 

24
00:01:35,482 --> 00:01:39,607
This will interfere with each other
and it is our role 

25
00:01:39,818 --> 00:01:42,893
to combine these trends. 

26
00:01:43,097 --> 00:01:46,622
So those, I mean, those 
are the technical linkages you see,

27
00:01:46,836 --> 00:01:49,573
but how about, we always 
in this course talk also about  

28
00:01:49,808 --> 00:01:52,908
social-technical system, 
the institutional aspects, 

29
00:01:53,124 --> 00:01:56,912
what are other linkages 
on the institutional side?

30
00:01:57,145 --> 00:02:00,445
There are a lot other dimensions
such as the political dimension. 

31
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:04,874
I'm thinking of the CO2 agreement, 
the Paris agreement 

32
00:02:05,104 --> 00:02:07,979
about the CO2 emissions 
which sets clear goals 

33
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:10,690
which are inline with 
our company goals 

34
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:14,464
or I'm thinking about 
the economical dimension.

35
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:19,410
There are a market liberalizations
in the electricity markets

36
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:23,394
such as we have observed in Germany
which will affect us, 

37
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:26,882
or there are simply social, 
the social dimensions.

38
00:02:27,107 --> 00:02:30,070
We want to provide a good 
living quality,  

39
00:02:30,282 --> 00:02:34,969
a good infrastructure and services 
to our inhabitants and customers.

40
00:02:35,218 --> 00:02:39,418
So, for an integrated utility 
like yours, I mean, 

41
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:42,977
what kind of opportunities 
do you see in linking 

42
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:48,111
the smart urban electricity system
with the other infrastructures. 

43
00:02:49,386 --> 00:02:52,586
There are a lot of trends nowadays, 
I mentioned previously 

44
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,335
that decentralization, 
but there might also be 

45
00:02:55,556 --> 00:02:59,269
the digitization which has 
to be mentioned 

46
00:02:59,495 --> 00:03:02,920
For example, we have this 
initiative together

47
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,720
with the local trade association 
Smart Regio Basel

48
00:03:06,934 --> 00:03:10,334
Smart Regio Basel, 
but we want to increase 

49
00:03:10,526 --> 00:03:13,389
the sustainability, 
the living quality,

50
00:03:13,609 --> 00:03:16,459
the efficiency within 
the area of Basel,

51
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:21,586
and probably, there might be 
in general three initiatives 

52
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:23,043
at the beginning. 

53
00:03:23,242 --> 00:03:27,205
So, of course we want to increase 
the smartness of our infrastructure,

54
00:03:27,387 --> 00:03:30,125
the inter-connections 
between these infrastructures,

55
00:03:30,308 --> 00:03:33,196
but we might also want 
to provide data 

56
00:03:33,405 --> 00:03:35,130
based on this infrastructure

57
00:03:35,309 --> 00:03:40,659
and might also provide data openly
which could attract new businesses. 

58
00:03:40,857 --> 00:03:45,969
But, first idea might be 
to establish a new market place,

59
00:03:46,164 --> 00:03:51,064
a digital market place where can be 
services locally exchanged

60
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:55,258
and in order to keep the value chain
within the region. 

61
00:03:55,495 --> 00:03:58,170
So, in order to seize 
all these opportunities, 

62
00:03:58,373 --> 00:04:00,785
what kind of challenges 
do you foresee? 

63
00:04:01,853 --> 00:04:04,915
There are a lot of challenges; 
there are financial challenges, 

64
00:04:05,107 --> 00:04:06,969
there are regulatory challenges, 

65
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:10,218
there are challenges 
about competences, 

66
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:14,031
But probably at the very beginning 
of this association, 

67
00:04:14,214 --> 00:04:16,852
the goal should be to bring 
the people together, 

68
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:20,919
to have a collaboration between 
all these actors and stakeholders. 

69
00:04:21,108 --> 00:04:25,183
So you say that we should 
start with collaboration

70
00:04:25,374 --> 00:04:29,174
but you know, there are many actors
that could organize 

71
00:04:29,409 --> 00:04:31,921
why do you think utility 

72
00:04:32,093 --> 00:04:35,931
and integrated utility like yours
is well particularly 

73
00:04:36,124 --> 00:04:40,099
well positioned to organize
 such collaboration. 

74
00:04:40,987 --> 00:04:43,599
Of course, there are a lot 
of stakeholders

75
00:04:43,794 --> 00:04:47,619
that can start such an initiative, 
however, I would,

76
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:51,387
you could think about layers, 
so there's an infrastructure layer.

77
00:04:51,588 --> 00:04:56,125
There might be a data layer on top
based on this infrastructure

78
00:04:56,327 --> 00:04:58,689
and based on the data 
and the infrastructure, 

79
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:02,229
you can provide applications 
and projects 

80
00:05:02,444 --> 00:05:04,507
of this information and data.

81
00:05:04,746 --> 00:05:08,196
So like a project or innovator layer
and of course, 

82
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:12,096
utility brings in a lot 
of infrastructure and a lot of data.

83
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:17,053
So I think we have possession 
to support this association. 

84
00:05:17,976 --> 00:05:20,551
Okay, thank you very much 
for your insights. 

85
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,215
Thank you very much.
