1
00:00:06,211 --> 00:00:08,261
Welcome back to the course. 

2
00:00:08,449 --> 00:00:12,774
Now, in this session, 
we're going discuss the challenges

3
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:18,687
that result from the transition to
smart urban energy infrastructures

4
00:00:19,435 --> 00:00:21,823
and we will do this in two steps. 

5
00:00:22,033 --> 00:00:27,421
First, we will put the urban 
energy infrastructures into context

6
00:00:27,635 --> 00:00:30,723
and then we will outline 
the main actors 

7
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:34,687
that are involved in managing 
these infrastructures. 

8
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:37,344
Now let's look at the context. 

9
00:00:37,562 --> 00:00:42,400
Now, we have already presented 
the three main drivers 

10
00:00:42,623 --> 00:00:45,035
of smart urban energy systems. 

11
00:00:45,684 --> 00:00:50,522
The decentralized generation, 
the intermittent generation, 

12
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:57,212
and then the changes in consumption
due to the price signals. 

13
00:00:57,651 --> 00:01:02,251
Now, let's look at this in 
a little bit more concrete fashion.

14
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:05,606
So, we have four things. 

15
00:01:05,818 --> 00:01:10,056
First, we have alternative
urban energy sources. 

16
00:01:10,256 --> 00:01:13,994
We have talked earlier about 
wind energy, 

17
00:01:14,193 --> 00:01:18,268
about local wind production, 
local solar production, 

18
00:01:18,498 --> 00:01:23,335
but we should also mention
geothermal energy

19
00:01:23,574 --> 00:01:28,337
that is increasingly important 
in cities, as well as, 

20
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:31,033
energy produced from waste. 

21
00:01:31,876 --> 00:01:35,913
Then, we have much more 
efficient, 

22
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:39,128
energy efficient 
consumption patterns, 

23
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:42,472
This results from more 
efficient houses, 

24
00:01:42,657 --> 00:01:48,183
more efficient areas, 
more efficient factories, 

25
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:52,047
more efficient transportation, 

26
00:01:52,244 --> 00:01:58,469
more efficient recycling
and waste management. 

27
00:01:59,756 --> 00:02:04,481
Third, we have semi 
or entirely 

28
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:08,227
off grid electricity operations 

29
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:12,606
that is electricity operations 
that at times consume, 

30
00:02:12,823 --> 00:02:17,985
at times feed back 
into the urban electricity system,

31
00:02:18,604 --> 00:02:23,591
and finally, we have new 
emerging storage solutions

32
00:02:23,827 --> 00:02:27,952
that can be in vehicles, 
that can be in houses,

33
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:31,354
that can bigger, even in factories. 

34
00:02:32,273 --> 00:02:35,849
Now, all these four elements 

35
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:39,613
lead to challenges 

36
00:02:39,818 --> 00:02:43,405
in managing 
the urban energy infrastructure, 

37
00:02:43,632 --> 00:02:45,957
the urban energy grid, 

38
00:02:46,214 --> 00:02:50,426
something that is called 
smart grid today.

39
00:02:50,638 --> 00:02:54,913
So let us now look at the different 
actors that are involved 

40
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:58,096
in urban electricity systems. 

41
00:02:58,309 --> 00:03:01,797
Now we have already talked about 
the whole production chain

42
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:04,685
from extraction to conversion, 
to transmission 

43
00:03:04,925 --> 00:03:08,613
that would be outside of the city 
to distribution, storage, 

44
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:12,439
and producing and consuming 
inside the city. 

45
00:03:12,668 --> 00:03:16,580
Those would typically be 
the urban energy infrastructure.

46
00:03:17,203 --> 00:03:22,853
Now, there are a series of actors 
that are involved here

47
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:28,097
and these actors all 
interact with each other

48
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,548
and ultimately have 
to be coordinated.

49
00:03:30,776 --> 00:03:34,139
Let's start with from bottom to top.

50
00:03:34,316 --> 00:03:37,191
So there are the prosumers 
as we have said, 

51
00:03:37,434 --> 00:03:40,034
the ones who consume electricity 

52
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:42,322
and produce electricity 
at the same time, 

53
00:03:42,532 --> 00:03:45,707
Those can be household
and industry. 

54
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:50,135
Then, we have decentralized 
electricity producers 

55
00:03:50,356 --> 00:03:53,418
who can be the same 
as the prosumers,

56
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,650
but they can also be producers 
on their own 

57
00:03:57,868 --> 00:04:02,056
in the sense of waste facility

58
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:04,574
that produces electricity. 

59
00:04:04,789 --> 00:04:09,389
Then we have storage operators
which can be transport operators 

60
00:04:09,579 --> 00:04:13,779
or storage operators on their own.

61
00:04:13,992 --> 00:04:16,130
Then we have distributors.

62
00:04:16,325 --> 00:04:20,875
Typically, we have an urban 
electricity energy distributor

63
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:25,833
but with off and semi off grids, 
we may have new distributors 

64
00:04:26,036 --> 00:04:30,648
that have to interact, 
that have to be coordinated. 

65
00:04:31,654 --> 00:04:35,441
But the challenge is not
just limited to the city 

66
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:39,724
because also the transmission system
operator, or operators,

67
00:04:39,947 --> 00:04:43,647
there may be several, 
are concerned, namely, 

68
00:04:43,902 --> 00:04:47,015
those are the actors that 
feed the electricity 

69
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:51,633
into the city and at times may even 
take back electricity 

70
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,762
to be stored in one of the dams 
as we have seen before. 

71
00:04:55,962 --> 00:05:00,799
Then there are the centralized 
electricity producers 

72
00:05:01,024 --> 00:05:03,462
that need to be coordinated, 

73
00:05:03,701 --> 00:05:06,264
and finally, there are the traders,

74
00:05:06,462 --> 00:05:13,400
the ones who fluidify consumption
and prosumption of electricity

75
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,505
by linking all the actors together. 

76
00:05:17,737 --> 00:05:23,575
Now, the challenge here 
is to manage  these interactions 

77
00:05:23,795 --> 00:05:28,107
and to coordinate all these actors 
among themselves,

78
00:05:28,289 --> 00:05:32,314
and digitalization is both 
the cause of this

79
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,070
and the answer to this.

80
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,366
It is thanks to digitalization 
that all these different actors 

81
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:43,546
can even emerge 
and play a role

82
00:05:43,749 --> 00:05:46,761
in smart urban energy systems 

83
00:05:46,963 --> 00:05:50,113
but it is also thanks 
to digitalization

84
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:55,729
that these actors can now 
be coordinated and managed so as 

85
00:05:55,943 --> 00:06:01,630
to make smart urban electricity 
infrastructures function.

86
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,945
Now, in the next session, 
you will hear 

87
00:06:06,141 --> 00:06:08,866
from a colleague of mine at EPFL 

88
00:06:09,045 --> 00:06:12,770
who is an expert on smart grids, 
stay tuned.
