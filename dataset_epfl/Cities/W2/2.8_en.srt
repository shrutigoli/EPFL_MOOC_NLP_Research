1
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:07,498
Welcome back to the course. 

2
00:00:07,697 --> 00:00:10,998
We have the pleasure of having 
Mr. Matthias BÃ¶lke with us today.

3
00:00:11,205 --> 00:00:13,180
He is the CEO and country president 

4
00:00:13,407 --> 00:00:15,782
of Schneider Electric Austria 
and Switzerland. 

5
00:00:15,980 --> 00:00:18,417
Matthias, thank you very much 
for having us.

6
00:00:18,596 --> 00:00:19,997
Thank you for having me !

7
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:22,636
My first question is the following,
what do you see 

8
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:25,200
as the main differences 
between the management 

9
00:00:25,412 --> 00:00:30,012
of legacy energy systems 
and emerging smart energy systems?

10
00:00:30,659 --> 00:00:31,883
Right. 

11
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:36,541
So the existing legacy system 
in place, 

12
00:00:36,802 --> 00:00:40,090
is in place since the beginning
of the electrification, 

13
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:41,704
you can say, right. 

14
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:45,981
So, that means we have three 
main characteristics;

15
00:00:46,186 --> 00:00:47,924
the production of the electricity, 

16
00:00:48,133 --> 00:00:51,119
the grid itself towards distribution
and then the sales. 

17
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:54,737
The production is basically, 
was and is still, 

18
00:00:54,936 --> 00:00:59,449
done by big power plants 
using basically coil, oil, 

19
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:05,069
water, and nuclear resources, 
right. 

20
00:01:05,275 --> 00:01:08,901
That's what it is today, 
and those power plants 

21
00:01:09,104 --> 00:01:12,542
are then injecting the current 
in the existing grid. 

22
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:14,739
Then it comes to distribution, 
the second part.

23
00:01:14,924 --> 00:01:17,949
The distribution is basically 
a top down grid today

24
00:01:18,143 --> 00:01:21,193
where you can say the current 
is almost flowing every time 

25
00:01:21,391 --> 00:01:24,341
in the same direction from 
the power plant to the end user 

26
00:01:25,178 --> 00:01:28,778
and it's a grid which is today
more electro-mechanical 

27
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:30,472
than anything else. 

28
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:34,018
Some automation is into stabilize
the friction of the grid, 

29
00:01:34,242 --> 00:01:36,917
to balance the between 
the power plant 

30
00:01:37,104 --> 00:01:40,442
and the end user I'd say, 
between the user and the load.

31
00:01:41,378 --> 00:01:44,403
And the third part is the sales. 

32
00:01:44,603 --> 00:01:48,141
Legacy was a regulated system,
for sure. 

33
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:51,363
Power plant and grid in one end, 

34
00:01:51,572 --> 00:01:57,085
so, regulated prices as well, 
stable prizes, high margins 

35
00:01:57,265 --> 00:02:01,366
and also end users could not 
really change the supplier, right. 

36
00:02:02,303 --> 00:02:04,790
So, this ecosystem, 
this whole ecosystem

37
00:02:04,973 --> 00:02:07,987
is now a huge transformation, 
basically because of two things,

38
00:02:08,203 --> 00:02:12,878
First, we have now an affordable way
to alternative energy. 

39
00:02:13,567 --> 00:02:17,230
And second, we have digitalization
in the electricity

40
00:02:17,436 --> 00:02:21,923
which is as you can imagine, 
a big, big thing. 

41
00:02:24,039 --> 00:02:27,527
Driven, all that, by sustainability 
because we know 

42
00:02:27,718 --> 00:02:30,368
that we have a growing 
population on earth

43
00:02:30,564 --> 00:02:31,839
especially for cities.

44
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:34,024
We're talking about 
smart cities, right?

45
00:02:34,204 --> 00:02:38,180
We have now the figure, we've
doubled our energy consumptions

46
00:02:38,394 --> 00:02:40,469
to  2050 from now. 

47
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:44,814
We have to divide CO2 emissions 
if we want to stop climate change,

48
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:48,175
and this is now changing 
really dramatically, 

49
00:02:48,367 --> 00:02:52,567
the ecosystem of the energy grid 
for the future, 

50
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,410
and already happening now. 

51
00:02:54,585 --> 00:02:57,322
And it's influencing 
all these three things, production,

52
00:02:57,516 --> 00:02:58,803
distribution and sales. 

53
00:02:58,995 --> 00:03:02,170
The production, we'll go away 
from these centralized power plants

54
00:03:02,361 --> 00:03:04,873
to a decentralized way to produce.

55
00:03:05,697 --> 00:03:10,698
The distribution grid is really 
a change from vertical topology

56
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:15,886
to  horizontal grids, 
highly automated, highly digitalized 

57
00:03:16,766 --> 00:03:20,991
and for the sales, 
ecosystem will go away 

58
00:03:21,222 --> 00:03:26,459
from a regulated system
to a deregulated market, 

59
00:03:26,694 --> 00:03:30,656
open market, where the end user 
can choose his supply 

60
00:03:30,918 --> 00:03:33,056
of electricity and energy, 
right. 

61
00:03:33,275 --> 00:03:36,926
Where a lot of more trading happen, 

62
00:03:37,135 --> 00:03:40,048
a lot of more flexibility happen, 
so that really, 

63
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,712
the whole system is 
changing dramatically. 

64
00:03:43,946 --> 00:03:47,208
Matthias, what do yo see 
as main benefits and risk 

65
00:03:47,405 --> 00:03:51,943
associated with the emergence
of smart energy systems for cities?

66
00:03:52,632 --> 00:03:55,656
Well Maxime, clearly I see much more
benefits and risks, right? 

67
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,901
But, let's talk about both, right. 

68
00:03:58,107 --> 00:04:01,581
Listen, if you see 
a smart grid deployment,

69
00:04:01,803 --> 00:04:04,253
a smart campus deployment
in a given city, right, 

70
00:04:04,466 --> 00:04:07,828
is for me a highly attractive, 
right, for  a major 

71
00:04:08,034 --> 00:04:10,884
or for the official bodies 
of the city for instance. 

72
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:13,492
If you see we have this, 
this sought of production. 

73
00:04:13,692 --> 00:04:18,116
We have the smart energy grid, 
we have new ways of trading

74
00:04:18,328 --> 00:04:21,878
between producers 
and consumers, right.

75
00:04:22,059 --> 00:04:24,196
We have prosumers which are 
even out of the scene.

76
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:27,672
The same guy can produce the energy,
sell the energy, use energy

77
00:04:27,869 --> 00:04:30,882
or buy the energy, 
all of this in a very smart way. 

78
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,815
I mean here, so,  
are lot of new functions,

79
00:04:35,003 --> 00:04:38,979
new business to come,
new jobs to come, right. 

80
00:04:39,175 --> 00:04:42,125
But this is highly attractive 
and a big benefit 

81
00:04:42,332 --> 00:04:43,957
for a given city, right. 

82
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,775
We have stability in the grid,

83
00:04:46,003 --> 00:04:48,028
which is decentralized 
approach as well.

84
00:04:48,256 --> 00:04:50,557
and we have the suspect 
of sustainability, 

85
00:04:50,751 --> 00:04:53,812
and sustainability is for me 
an also clearly attractiveness 

86
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:56,386
of the future of a given city,
right. 

87
00:04:56,597 --> 00:05:02,310
Now, if you see more digitalization
and more smartness

88
00:05:02,527 --> 00:05:05,652
in the grid gives us 
much more visibility.

89
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:08,545
So visibility means we can see 
where for instance

90
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:10,313
we are wasting energy, right. 

91
00:05:10,487 --> 00:05:12,899
So this is also a clear benefit 

92
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:17,652
and if we even can correlate
then process data, this energy data,

93
00:05:17,868 --> 00:05:20,267
I mean process data 
for instance, for production, 

94
00:05:20,476 --> 00:05:24,001
can be SAP ordering system 
in plants,

95
00:05:24,217 --> 00:05:27,542
or can be a patient system 
in a given hospital, 

96
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:32,514
can be data about moments 
of people in a hotel. 

97
00:05:32,739 --> 00:05:35,476
If you correlate those 
process data, then again,

98
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:38,419
we see energy view in real time,

99
00:05:38,614 --> 00:05:40,276
you really can save energy, 

100
00:05:40,486 --> 00:05:42,961
you really can make the system 
much more efficient. 

101
00:05:43,158 --> 00:05:45,621
and you can have also 
some good inputs 

102
00:05:45,823 --> 00:05:48,160
to the effectiveness 
of the process itself, 

103
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:50,308
which is also a huge benefit.

104
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:52,378
So on the technical level, 
I see also 

105
00:05:52,575 --> 00:05:54,825
a lot of different benefits.

106
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:58,520
Now it comes to questions 
to risks, right, 

107
00:05:58,748 --> 00:06:01,572
so that, we're talking about 
much more data now once a system,

108
00:06:01,816 --> 00:06:05,390
much more digitalization software 
and so on. 

109
00:06:05,603 --> 00:06:10,390
So people tend to think and to say
that we have highly risk,

110
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:08,585
and may be also instability 
of this kind of things 

111
00:06:14,711 --> 00:06:17,886
which is in my view not the case 
because a true network 

112
00:06:18,805 --> 00:06:22,917
of things is always more stable
than centralized 

113
00:06:23,105 --> 00:06:25,243
or legacy system here,
when the plant 

114
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:27,783
is not operating anymore 
you have a huge problem, 

115
00:06:28,307 --> 00:06:31,357
Instead in a decentralized way, 
when one producer 

116
00:06:31,577 --> 00:06:33,777
is not going well, 
the rest of the system can 

117
00:06:33,985 --> 00:06:36,072
be very very stabilizing, 
right. 

118
00:06:37,172 --> 00:06:39,572
And then, 
there are data in this. 

119
00:06:39,773 --> 00:06:43,773
There is this question about 
data security, cyber security, 

120
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,102
data privacy as well, 
for sure.

121
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,627
This is certainly a risk,
but the business model 

122
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:51,097
and the driver behind 
this new world,

123
00:06:51,293 --> 00:06:55,055
this new world change is so big
and so important

124
00:06:55,266 --> 00:06:58,616
that I truly believe that 
those two points;

125
00:06:59,376 --> 00:07:02,488
cyber security and data privacy
will be solved. 

126
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:05,465
Matthias, last question. 

127
00:07:05,658 --> 00:07:07,407
What would you say are  the main

128
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:09,682
technical and institutional 
conditions 

129
00:07:09,887 --> 00:07:13,962
to guarantee a successful transition
for legacy energy system

130
00:07:14,176 --> 00:07:16,401
to smart energy systems?

131
00:07:16,633 --> 00:07:19,421
Now Maxime, I think the technical 
preconditions are there almost,

132
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:23,558
right, so we're building today
such smart city approaches already 

133
00:07:23,781 --> 00:07:27,168
and smart energy approaches, 
we have today. 

134
00:07:27,389 --> 00:07:29,777
There are a lot of components 
available in the market today

135
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:32,753
where you have highly 
intelligence in.

136
00:07:33,515 --> 00:07:36,528
The electrical grid can be equipped 
today by a lot of components 

137
00:07:36,754 --> 00:07:40,879
which have incorporated a chip
which is measuring the current 

138
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:43,572
and imitating data
 in the same time, right.

139
00:07:43,757 --> 00:07:46,744
So this is not very expensive 
and you have by definition 

140
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:50,743
a huge visibility,  if you do it
right from the start 

141
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,744
you have the preconditions, 

142
00:07:52,909 --> 00:07:57,259
and then you have software on it, 
this data handling big data 

143
00:07:57,488 --> 00:07:59,813
aggregation, 
and such kinds of things  

144
00:08:00,037 --> 00:08:02,162
which are already today
 available too.

145
00:08:02,359 --> 00:08:05,334
and you can use it, 
we are doing this already. 

146
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:09,922
So I would say on the technical way,
a lot of things are available today.

147
00:08:10,902 --> 00:08:14,178
Now, you need to make sure 
that you stay 

148
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:18,329
with an open system 
that you can collaborate.

149
00:08:18,529 --> 00:08:21,217
You need to integrate new things.

150
00:08:22,992 --> 00:08:26,380
We have to think about 
just for instance 

151
00:08:26,559 --> 00:08:29,447
electrical charging infrastructure
for electrical vehicles,

152
00:08:29,659 --> 00:08:32,460
so we need this to be extended.

153
00:08:32,655 --> 00:08:35,155
Batteries are playing 
an important role

154
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,625
but you need to implement 
for instance traffic control.

155
00:08:37,855 --> 00:08:40,355
You need to integrate 
a water system.

156
00:08:40,589 --> 00:08:44,427
You need to integrate may be 
a city information system

157
00:08:44,662 --> 00:08:46,261
to the city center service.

158
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:50,179
That's why it's very important 
to choose an open system 

159
00:08:50,398 --> 00:08:53,599
and to have a big collaboration 
between relevant players 

160
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:55,661
in a given part, right. 

161
00:08:56,670 --> 00:09:02,558
Then you asked about governance 
or out the legal aspects, et cetera.

162
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:05,634
For me it's very important 
that you have,

163
00:09:05,858 --> 00:09:09,784
that you can gather important player
around the table

164
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:14,152
to design, to build an agenda, 

165
00:09:14,391 --> 00:09:17,266
and then to roll out 
such a kind of project. 

166
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,693
So this is who?

167
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:23,306
This is basically the governance 
of a city, of a region,

168
00:09:23,507 --> 00:09:27,344
of a state, so governmental aspect
is important.

169
00:09:27,564 --> 00:09:29,714
We have private investors,

170
00:09:31,143 --> 00:09:33,480
investment banks, 
development banks, 

171
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,510
but also private guys 
in a given city

172
00:09:35,722 --> 00:09:37,635
which can contribute a lot. 

173
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:41,520
We have guys as us, me, 
you know, industrial suppliers.

174
00:09:41,709 --> 00:09:45,385
So, we are doing electricity
but we also have ICT,

175
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:48,081
we have other service suppliers 
in the city, 

176
00:09:48,336 --> 00:09:50,474
so the private sector 
I would say.

177
00:09:50,703 --> 00:09:52,641
And then, very important 
from the beginning 

178
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:56,879
is certainly, the integration 
of the citizens in the city. 

179
00:09:57,468 --> 00:10:00,493
So you have a good buy-end
in the concept,

180
00:10:00,682 --> 00:10:03,482
Those people are contributing 

181
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:06,503
because it's all about behaviour. 

182
00:10:06,723 --> 00:10:10,136
it's about the perception
of what it can be, changed, 

183
00:10:10,345 --> 00:10:12,632
so that you take 
the people on board.

184
00:10:12,806 --> 00:10:17,182
And this can be either through 
associations for instance.

185
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:19,240
Think about the relevant 
associations you have. 

186
00:10:19,417 --> 00:10:22,493
You can take them in,
NGOs as well. 

187
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,513
So you have the voice
 of the customer 

188
00:10:25,702 --> 00:10:27,302
in your project, right. 

189
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,678
Then you have very 
important utilities

190
00:10:29,876 --> 00:10:32,389
which are delivering energies 
to the system, 

191
00:10:32,567 --> 00:10:34,941
water, gas, electricity, 

192
00:10:35,157 --> 00:10:39,270
but also more services, 
partly ICT services

193
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:42,318
and other services, because they are
 transforming a lot now,

194
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:45,642
so they can have 
with really a stake in it. 

195
00:10:45,844 --> 00:10:50,295
And last but not least, you need 
really guys which are planners

196
00:10:50,501 --> 00:10:53,326
infrastructure planners
but also electrical guys  which can 

197
00:10:53,531 --> 00:10:55,743
plan the whole system then 

198
00:10:55,944 --> 00:10:59,082
and can design it, and can then 
bring it to an agenda. 

199
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:04,616
So, I would say then
to have a good governance, 

200
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:10,130
on a smart city project 
or on an energy campus project, 

201
00:11:10,364 --> 00:11:13,527
you have different ways to do it.

202
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:16,331
You can for instance have 
a performance contracting

203
00:11:16,532 --> 00:11:20,070
where a city is outsourcing 
the contracting part, 

204
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:23,742
and you have a pay with them 
for party things,

205
00:11:23,944 --> 00:11:26,057
you can have a designed built
operate model

206
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:29,029
where really the city is going 
to gift the whole thing 

207
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:31,808
to an external supplier, 
and who would then take care 

208
00:11:31,985 --> 00:11:34,935
about the running model 
of your system. 

209
00:11:35,104 --> 00:11:38,192
There are software as a service, 
It's a big thing coming

210
00:11:38,376 --> 00:11:40,027
where we are using cloud services 

211
00:11:40,238 --> 00:11:42,700
and where the data you need, 
are some how 

212
00:11:42,869 --> 00:11:46,018
in a clear governance, 
and can be used

213
00:11:46,238 --> 00:11:48,363
 for next steps of services.

214
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,175
So that also very important. 

215
00:11:50,388 --> 00:11:53,051
So I think the name of the game 
is all about,

216
00:11:53,253 --> 00:11:56,204
let's say collaboration, 
about integration, 

217
00:11:56,401 --> 00:11:59,913
having the right stakeholder
around the table, 

218
00:12:00,123 --> 00:12:01,661
as much as you can. 

219
00:12:01,835 --> 00:12:04,673
Of course there's a question 
of governance and to take it forward

220
00:12:04,866 --> 00:12:07,528
but, our experience has said 
this collaboration 

221
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:10,035
and integration of 
all the stakeholders 

222
00:12:10,253 --> 00:12:13,666
is really mandatory 
to be successful then 

223
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,774
in such kind of  projects. 

224
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:19,356
thank you very much Matthias 
for answering our questions. 

225
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:21,964
You're welcome, 
thank you.
