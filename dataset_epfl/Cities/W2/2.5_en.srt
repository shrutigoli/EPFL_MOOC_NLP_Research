1
00:00:05,632 --> 00:00:06,994
Welcome back.

2
00:00:07,189 --> 00:00:11,739
In this session, we will talk about 
smart urban energy services.

3
00:00:11,947 --> 00:00:16,697
In particular, we will talk about 
what these services exactly are 

4
00:00:16,901 --> 00:00:18,726
and who can provide them. 

5
00:00:18,928 --> 00:00:21,090
Let us look now at what these 

6
00:00:21,298 --> 00:00:24,610
smart urban energy services 
exactly are.

7
00:00:24,807 --> 00:00:28,082
So, we have already mentioned 
in session two, 

8
00:00:28,274 --> 00:00:34,524
the three main dynamics that 
are taking place in urban energy.

9
00:00:34,712 --> 00:00:40,562
The move from centralized production
to decentralized generation, 

10
00:00:40,754 --> 00:00:45,304
the move from planned production
to intermittent generation 

11
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:48,881
and then all these price signals 
that relate

12
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,402
 to the whole automatization
of this process. 

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,230
Now, there are four types 
of customers 

14
00:00:56,441 --> 00:01:00,241
of such smart urban energy services.

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:03,173
There are households, 
you and me. 

16
00:01:03,365 --> 00:01:07,515
There are entire buildings 
with a lot of households in it. 

17
00:01:07,728 --> 00:01:11,615
Then, there are commercial
or industrial areas,

18
00:01:11,824 --> 00:01:15,799
like for example, an airport
or a shopping mall,

19
00:01:15,987 --> 00:01:18,549
and then there is another 
type of customer, 

20
00:01:18,753 --> 00:01:23,653
those are the distribution 
and transmissions system operators

21
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,270
who will buy balancing energy. 

22
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:26,970


23
00:01:26,498 --> 00:01:30,223
So here you have three 
types of services;

24
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:32,709
smart energy services. 

25
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,443
The first one, very clearly 
attributable to the grid operators 

26
00:01:38,651 --> 00:01:40,339
is the balancing energy.

27
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:46,804
The energy that these operators need
in order to keep the grid stable. 

28
00:01:47,491 --> 00:01:52,116
Then there are the services
that relate

29
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:54,482
to demand-side management.

30
00:01:54,671 --> 00:01:59,359
At this point, those are purely
services in terms of electricity.

31
00:01:59,575 --> 00:02:04,250
Basically, you offer the services 
to households, buildings,

32
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:06,727
commercial and industrial areas, 

33
00:02:06,919 --> 00:02:11,444
in terms of managing 
their demand of electricity 

34
00:02:11,634 --> 00:02:13,771
much more efficiently 

35
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:18,124
in relationship to price signals, 
for example. 

36
00:02:18,341 --> 00:02:20,991
And then, a little bit broader 

37
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:25,730
are the smart and integrated 
services 

38
00:02:25,934 --> 00:02:27,771
and urban energy services.

39
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,321
Those are the services that now link
the electricity, 

40
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:36,007
urban electricity system 
with other systems, 

41
00:02:36,218 --> 00:02:39,968
with the water system,
with the transport system

42
00:02:40,177 --> 00:02:43,602
with the batteries for the car, 
with the waste, 

43
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:47,047
with the recycling and also there, 

44
00:02:47,256 --> 00:02:51,656
the same customer households, 
buildings, commercial areas, 

45
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:55,749
can receive these kinds
of integrated 

46
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,880
smart energy services. 

47
00:02:59,082 --> 00:03:02,407
Who are the providers 
of these services?

48
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:07,085
Now, in the core, 
we have of course as we have said, 

49
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:11,050
the dynamics, the digitalization
that favors all this 

50
00:03:11,267 --> 00:03:14,904
and you will see how that 
affects the providers. 

51
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:18,875
So, typically, 
the traditional providers 

52
00:03:19,077 --> 00:03:24,477
are the electricity distribution
companies within a city.

53
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,871
They can offer demand side 
management

54
00:03:28,068 --> 00:03:31,643
to all the different customers 
that we have seen 

55
00:03:31,862 --> 00:03:36,312
and they also to a certain extent 
offer smart 

56
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:41,504
and integrated energy services 
by venturing into other, 

57
00:03:41,726 --> 00:03:44,426
into waste, into transport, 
for example, 

58
00:03:44,642 --> 00:03:50,042
if they operate the charging station
of the local bus system

59
00:03:50,225 --> 00:03:55,875
or if they operate some sought of 
batteries for shopping malls 

60
00:03:56,134 --> 00:03:59,959
and other commercial areas. 

61
00:04:00,186 --> 00:04:02,786
But those are legacy operators. 

62
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,395
Then, we have urban utilities.

63
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,808
By that, we mean the type 
of companies

64
00:04:10,027 --> 00:04:12,865
that are not traditionally 
in the electricity,

65
00:04:13,064 --> 00:04:15,327
in the urban electricity business, 
but they are 

66
00:04:15,528 --> 00:04:19,666
in our urban water distributors, 
urban waste managers, 

67
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:23,669
urban public transport operators,

68
00:04:23,883 --> 00:04:29,070
and they can now offer these 
integrated energy services

69
00:04:29,276 --> 00:04:33,713
and offer also balancing services

70
00:04:33,939 --> 00:04:38,101
by linking the consumption patterns 

71
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:44,010
of the household, and linking that 
to energy consumption. 

72
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:48,637
And then, there are what 
we call intermediaries. 

73
00:04:48,842 --> 00:04:52,855
Those are new operators 
that have not been

74
00:04:53,082 --> 00:04:55,544
in the urban business at all. 

75
00:04:55,771 --> 00:05:00,921
They basically, produce devices 
or have information

76
00:05:01,153 --> 00:05:03,903
like telecom operators 
for example. 

77
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:07,788
They have information 
about your

78
00:05:08,443 --> 00:05:11,043
electricity consumption

79
00:05:11,245 --> 00:05:16,470
and they can manage that consumption
and sell the services

80
00:05:17,278 --> 00:05:22,266
both to you as a customer
or as an industrial area, 

81
00:05:22,477 --> 00:05:26,877
and to the balancing, 
to the great companies 

82
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,927
that need balancing energy.

83
00:05:29,114 --> 00:05:32,014
That is actually an interesting 
business model

84
00:05:32,177 --> 00:05:36,040
that we see appearing 
in many cities. 

85
00:05:36,491 --> 00:05:39,741
But this is also possible
thanks to what we call 

86
00:05:39,932 --> 00:05:42,070
peer to peer operators. 

87
00:05:42,284 --> 00:05:46,809
That is also called energy commons
or electricity commons 

88
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:50,013
where customers get together 

89
00:05:50,201 --> 00:05:54,851
and do this kind of demand side 
management together.

90
00:05:55,062 --> 00:05:59,700
Sought of taking out 
the intermediaries themselves. 

91
00:06:00,643 --> 00:06:04,880
Now, we can see new comers 

92
00:06:05,088 --> 00:06:08,025
in all of these areas, 

93
00:06:08,222 --> 00:06:10,685
and so potentially, 

94
00:06:10,888 --> 00:06:15,238
the smart urban energy services

95
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:18,521
can be provided increasingly 

96
00:06:18,721 --> 00:06:22,046
by operators that come 
from outside the city, 

97
00:06:22,241 --> 00:06:26,804
operators that have no history
in infrastructures. 

98
00:06:26,988 --> 00:06:32,088
And I think that's the real novelty
in smart urban energy services.
