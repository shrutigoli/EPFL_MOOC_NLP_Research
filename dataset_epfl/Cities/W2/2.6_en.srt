00:00:05,369 --> 00:00:06,819
Welcome back. 

2
00:00:07,388 --> 00:00:12,388
In this session, we will now talk 
about urban energy systems

3
00:00:12,618 --> 00:00:17,618
data layer, that is the real novelty
in smart cities

4
00:00:17,841 --> 00:00:20,804
and in smart urban energy systems,

5
00:00:20,974 --> 00:00:23,399
and we will do this in three steps.

6
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:27,806
First, how to think this data layer

7
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:32,539
Then, the two visions 
that one can apply to this

8
00:00:32,751 --> 00:00:39,114
and then, thirdly,  the  questions 
that this two visions have raised.

9
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:44,538
So, lets fist look at how to think 

10
00:00:44,736 --> 00:00:47,949
the urban energy systems
 data layer. 

11
00:00:48,172 --> 00:00:51,672
Now this picture, we have already 
seen in week one,

12
00:00:51,871 --> 00:00:54,833
where we said that the digital 
or the data layer 

13
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:57,996
is the novelty of smart cities,

14
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:02,045
or smart urban energy systems
in this case. 

15
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:08,110
Now, first, there are data 
being generated

16
00:01:09,022 --> 00:01:11,959
and these data 
 are basically generated 

17
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:14,275
from three different sources.

18
00:01:14,453 --> 00:01:18,628
There are data about user behaviour,

19
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:25,637
there are data general electricity
or energy generators behaviour. 

20
00:01:25,802 --> 00:01:28,864
how much is consumed, 
how much is produced, 

21
00:01:29,076 --> 00:01:33,401
and then very importantly, 
there are data about the behaviour 

22
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:37,653
of the grid, in this case, 
the distribution grid,

23
00:01:37,869 --> 00:01:42,144
as a function of user 
and generator behaviour. 

24
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:48,038
On the basis of this data, 
there are urban, 

25
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,078
smart urban energy 
services providers, 

26
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:56,513
and this looks like this, 
the services as we have seen 

27
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,079
in the previous session
are offered to different, 

28
00:02:01,277 --> 00:02:03,614
different types of customers 

29
00:02:03,797 --> 00:02:07,922
and there are different types 
of services that are being offered

30
00:02:08,113 --> 00:02:12,088
but all they have in common 
is that they use the data 

31
00:02:12,303 --> 00:02:15,591
that has so being generated. 

32
00:02:16,809 --> 00:02:21,997
Now, let's look at the two visions 
that are possible for this,

33
00:02:22,186 --> 00:02:26,936
and the first vision, really 
pertains to the, 

34
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:32,478
and it's an integrated view 
of data generation 

35
00:02:32,692 --> 00:02:35,842
and data usage 
for services provision. 

36
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:39,422
This is typically the vision 
that can, 

37
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:44,831
that is held by 
electricity utilities

38
00:02:45,037 --> 00:02:47,662
that have the data about generation

39
00:02:47,849 --> 00:02:51,387
and that also want to provide 
the services 

40
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,883
on the basis of these data. 

41
00:02:54,066 --> 00:02:57,903
There may be some related companies
that access to the infrastructure 

42
00:02:58,097 --> 00:03:03,509
but basically here the vision is, 
that this is integrated. 

43
00:03:03,724 --> 00:03:08,837
All the data generation 
and the services are integrated,

44
00:03:09,017 --> 00:03:13,530
and there are 
the different companies

45
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:16,145
that own these data 
and offer the services 

46
00:03:16,338 --> 00:03:20,701
are competing against each other,
not sharing this data.  

47
00:03:21,254 --> 00:03:24,679
The second vision is 
totally different

48
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:28,712
in the sense that 
there are data platforms 

49
00:03:28,933 --> 00:03:34,033
and the different data generators 
feed all these data 

50
00:03:34,241 --> 00:03:38,479
into the platforms, and then 
the services providers 

51
00:03:38,663 --> 00:03:42,638
take the information from
these platforms

52
00:03:42,852 --> 00:03:46,277
and develop different 
types of services

53
00:03:46,489 --> 00:03:50,914
to different types of customers 
as a result of that. 

54
00:03:52,055 --> 00:03:58,005
Now, this leads to very 
different questions. 

55
00:03:58,793 --> 00:04:02,943
The first question on the left side,
if we have integrated 

56
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:06,768
data generation and services, 

57
00:04:06,965 --> 00:04:12,627
this basically considers data 
as a good. 

58
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:16,503
It's something that somebody 
has produced, 

59
00:04:16,737 --> 00:04:20,049
that somebody uses in order 
to create services 

60
00:04:20,268 --> 00:04:23,706
and basically the question here is, 
who owns the data?

61
00:04:24,638 --> 00:04:30,338
The users, the utility, 
the devise producers, for example. 

62
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:33,923
And this raises the question
of regulation, 

63
00:04:34,127 --> 00:04:36,052
but from this point of view, 

64
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,626
regulation is basically 
a competition regulation. 

65
00:04:39,839 --> 00:04:44,102
You need to make sure that
there is sufficient competition here

66
00:04:44,278 --> 00:04:49,215
and that ownership rights 
are respected 

67
00:04:49,403 --> 00:04:51,366
in this kind of competition. 

68
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:56,583
No market distortion, 
no tendency to monopoly, 

69
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:58,635
things like that

70
00:04:58,835 --> 00:05:02,573
On the other side, 
if we data as a platform,

71
00:05:02,774 --> 00:05:05,774
as a shared platform, 
the question is, 

72
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:10,582
who owns this platform, or not even 
necessarily owns the platform

73
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:13,278
but who manages this platform?

74
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,494
And in terms of regulation, 

75
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:17,960
the approach also is 
totally different 

76
00:05:18,157 --> 00:05:20,082
because you will end up 

77
00:05:20,295 --> 00:05:24,408
with some sort of 
infrastructure type regulation.

78
00:05:24,614 --> 00:05:28,239
Access to the data, 
availability of the data, 

79
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:30,881
transparency of the data, 

80
00:05:31,065 --> 00:05:33,740
prices of the data, 

81
00:05:33,957 --> 00:05:36,069
all questions of that sort. 

82
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:41,662
So we can see that there are really 
two different types of visions

83
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:46,358
leading to two different types 
of regulating 

84
00:05:46,532 --> 00:05:49,382
dealing ultimately with this data. 

85
00:05:49,567 --> 00:05:53,492
Now that we have discussed 
the three different layers,

86
00:05:53,719 --> 00:05:57,531
let's ask Schneider Electric
how they see 

87
00:05:57,728 --> 00:06:00,528
the smart urban energy system. 

88
00:06:00,723 --> 00:06:02,261
So stay tuned.
