1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:06,635
So let us first move

2
00:00:06,835 --> 00:00:08,310
to the conceptualization

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:10,685
of smart urban energy systems.

4
00:00:10,885 --> 00:00:13,398
And we will do this in three steps

5
00:00:13,598 --> 00:00:15,023
First,

6
00:00:15,223 --> 00:00:16,910
we identify the drivers

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:19,648
towards smart urban energy systems.

8
00:00:19,848 --> 00:00:21,948
Then we will conceptualize

9
00:00:22,148 --> 00:00:25,148
the evolution of the urban energy
smart system.

10
00:00:25,348 --> 00:00:26,423
And finally,

11
00:00:26,623 --> 00:00:29,623
we will present
the three layers of transition.

12
00:00:29,823 --> 00:00:31,998
Now let's look at the drivers.

13
00:00:33,398 --> 00:00:36,635
So the smart urban energy systems

14
00:00:36,835 --> 00:00:40,398
are the result of three main drivers

15
00:00:40,598 --> 00:00:43,035
and they are all at the same level.

16
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:44,673
But let's first mention

17
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:47,385
the evolution of urban

18
00:00:47,498 --> 00:00:49,535
infrastructure technologies.

19
00:00:49,735 --> 00:00:53,085
There are energy technologies
that are changing,

20
00:00:53,285 --> 00:00:55,648
and we will talk 
a little bit later about that.

21
00:00:55,785 --> 00:00:57,823
But with decentralized production.

22
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:59,260
Renewable energies.

23
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,873
There are technologies in transport

24
00:01:01,985 --> 00:01:05,785
that are changing,
that affect urban energy.

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,585
Like electric vehicles,

26
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:11,785


27
00:01:08,785 --> 00:01:10,910
electric buses,

28
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,173
electric bicycles,

29
00:01:12,335 --> 00:01:14,623
electric charging stations 
that go with it.

30
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:17,248
There are housing technologies

31
00:01:17,448 --> 00:01:20,010
that are changing.

32
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:22,498
Houses become more self-sufficient,

33
00:01:22,698 --> 00:01:25,698
are producing themselves energy

34
00:01:25,898 --> 00:01:27,110
or electricity.

35
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:29,798
There are changes in 
district heating.

36
00:01:29,998 --> 00:01:31,923
In pump storage.

37
00:01:32,085 --> 00:01:33,610
So the first 
important driver

38
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,023
is really the fact that technologies

39
00:01:36,223 --> 00:01:38,798
around the energy sector

40
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:40,110
are changing.

41
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,185
The second driver
is of course

42
00:01:42,385 --> 00:01:45,318
climate change
resource efficiency.

43
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:48,518
Cities are big polluters.

44
00:01:48,718 --> 00:01:51,018
And are one of the drivers

45
00:01:51,218 --> 00:01:53,718
of smarter urban energy systems

46
00:01:53,918 --> 00:01:56,018
is of course the desire

47
00:01:56,218 --> 00:01:58,781
to reduce Co2 emissions,

48
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:01,981
and to become 
more energy self-sufficient.

49
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,518
And the third driver

50
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:07,256
is as core of our MOOC,

51
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:08,418
of course,

52
00:02:08,493 --> 00:02:09,593
is digitalization. 

53
00:02:09,668 --> 00:02:11,018
Actually digitalization

54
00:02:11,093 --> 00:02:12,106
as we will see

55
00:02:12,306 --> 00:02:14,731
is the vehicle by which

56
00:02:14,931 --> 00:02:17,931
urban energy systems 
can become smart.

57
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:21,381
Now let's look at the main dynamics

58
00:02:21,581 --> 00:02:23,981
of these urban energy systems.

59
00:02:24,593 --> 00:02:26,281
Now, traditionally,

60
00:02:26,481 --> 00:02:29,093
energy works like this:

61
00:02:29,268 --> 00:02:31,543
It is produced

62
00:02:31,706 --> 00:02:34,618
in a very centralized way

63
00:02:34,818 --> 00:02:37,118
by big power plants.

64
00:02:37,318 --> 00:02:41,743
Then electricity is 
transmitted into the city

65
00:02:41,943 --> 00:02:43,743
And in the city

66
00:02:43,818 --> 00:02:45,481
it is distributed

67
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:48,681
to households and to firms,

68
00:02:48,881 --> 00:02:50,218
to areas, to airports,

69
00:02:50,418 --> 00:02:51,431
to shopping malls.

70
00:02:51,631 --> 00:02:53,668
It is very linear

71
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:56,868
from centralized production

72
00:02:57,068 --> 00:03:00,368
to decentralized
distribution process.

73
00:03:01,643 --> 00:03:03,418
Now what is changing?

74
00:03:03,618 --> 00:03:05,156
First thing that changes

75
00:03:05,356 --> 00:03:09,343
is the production process.

76
00:03:09,543 --> 00:03:10,731
We are moving

77
00:03:10,806 --> 00:03:12,793
from centralized production

78
00:03:12,993 --> 00:03:15,993
to decentralized generation.

79
00:03:16,193 --> 00:03:18,856
Of course there is still 
centralized production,

80
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:21,793
but it becomes less important

81
00:03:21,993 --> 00:03:25,931
as areas, factories, households

82
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:29,981
are generating 
their own electricity. 

83
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,200
And are feeding 
some of this electricity

84
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:37,452
back into the grid
at certain times.

85
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,789
The second major change,

86
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:43,251
is from plant production

87
00:03:43,414 --> 00:03:47,189
to intermittent generation. 

88
00:03:47,389 --> 00:03:50,389
And this is basically the result

89
00:03:50,589 --> 00:03:52,926
of production of electricity

90
00:03:53,051 --> 00:03:55,176
thanks to renewables.

91
00:03:55,376 --> 00:03:58,609
Here in the examples 
of solar and wind.

92
00:03:58,809 --> 00:04:02,957
Now these kind 
of electricity production

93
00:04:03,007 --> 00:04:05,554
can happen at a decentralized level,

94
00:04:05,754 --> 00:04:08,297
but it can of course
also happen

95
00:04:08,497 --> 00:04:12,600
in very massive plants

96
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,934
at the centralized level,

97
00:04:15,134 --> 00:04:17,629
and then fed back into the grid.

98
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:22,048
The third major dynamics

99
00:04:22,248 --> 00:04:25,248
is one that relates to prices.

100
00:04:25,448 --> 00:04:27,855
Rather than having fixed prices,

101
00:04:28,055 --> 00:04:33,431
increasingly, we have price signals.

102
00:04:33,631 --> 00:04:36,455
And this relates to consumption,

103
00:04:36,655 --> 00:04:39,006
in the sense that 

104
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:41,481
consumers household areas

105
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,568
they can now store their energy

106
00:04:45,768 --> 00:04:47,332
at decentralized batteries,

107
00:04:47,532 --> 00:04:49,024
feedback the energy

108
00:04:49,224 --> 00:04:51,814
and maybe it is stored
in a dam somewhere.

109
00:04:52,014 --> 00:04:55,328
That is when prices are high,

110
00:04:56,992 --> 00:04:59,480
the energy is fed 
back into the grid.

111
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,393
When prices are low

112
00:05:01,593 --> 00:05:02,737
it is consumed again.

113
00:05:02,937 --> 00:05:05,745
And all this is being automatized.

114
00:05:05,945 --> 00:05:07,964
And this is one of the core features

115
00:05:08,164 --> 00:05:10,298
of smart urban energy systems.

116
00:05:10,498 --> 00:05:13,193
Is this automatic reaction

117
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:15,624
of devices to price signals. 

118
00:05:15,824 --> 00:05:17,879
Like the fridge turning off

119
00:05:18,079 --> 00:05:23,609
at moments when prices 
are passing a certain threshold.

120
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:26,427
And turning on again when prices
get cheaper.

121
00:05:27,972 --> 00:05:32,033
Now what are 
the main layers of transition?

122
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:37,045
Now here we have 
the urban electricity system first.

123
00:05:38,408 --> 00:05:40,583
As I present it before

124
00:05:40,962 --> 00:05:43,962
it is an integrated system

125
00:05:44,162 --> 00:05:46,799
where firms, areas, households

126
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:48,152
are self-generating,

127
00:05:48,352 --> 00:05:49,696
feeding into the grid,

128
00:05:49,896 --> 00:05:54,027
and of course there is still
electricity coming from outside.

129
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:55,920
But what is interesting

130
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,280
in urban energy systems

131
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:02,933
is the fact that 
there is a larger environment

132
00:06:03,133 --> 00:06:04,526
that is all related

133
00:06:04,726 --> 00:06:07,251
to energy and electricity.

134
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:09,290
The urban sociotechnical system.

135
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:11,123
Let us take examples:

136
00:06:11,323 --> 00:06:12,329
Factories.

137
00:06:12,529 --> 00:06:15,529
Not only do they produce and store

138
00:06:15,729 --> 00:06:18,729
but they can themselves be active

139
00:06:18,929 --> 00:06:22,242
in energy matters.

140
00:06:22,442 --> 00:06:23,885
Cars.

141
00:06:24,085 --> 00:06:27,528
Cars are running on electricity.

142
00:06:27,728 --> 00:06:30,165
They charge electricity 
at certain hours.

143
00:06:30,365 --> 00:06:32,186
The same for electric buses.

144
00:06:32,386 --> 00:06:34,699
For electric bicycles.

145
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:36,572
Households are totally...

146
00:06:36,772 --> 00:06:38,201
Houses are related.

147
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:42,530
Buildings are related
to the electricity system

148
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:45,644
by consuming and feeding back in.

149
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:47,271
The gas production

150
00:06:47,471 --> 00:06:49,620
is related to 
the electricity system.

151
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,754
Water.

152
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:52,999
Water, waste water,

153
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,875
you can make energy from waste.

154
00:06:58,061 --> 00:07:00,002
And all this together

155
00:07:00,202 --> 00:07:04,912
forms sort of the urban ecosystem

156
00:07:05,112 --> 00:07:06,633
that influences

157
00:07:06,833 --> 00:07:09,643
the smart urban electricity system.

158
00:07:09,843 --> 00:07:11,867
Now the layers of transition

159
00:07:12,067 --> 00:07:15,990
are the ones that
we have already identified

160
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,912
in the previous week.

161
00:07:18,112 --> 00:07:18,939
Namely, 

162
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:21,801
first the layer of infrastructure

163
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:23,427
and here we start to now

164
00:07:23,627 --> 00:07:25,435
talk about smart grid.

165
00:07:25,635 --> 00:07:27,694
This is the grid that is capable

166
00:07:27,894 --> 00:07:31,400
to handle all this intermittency.

167
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,916
A grid that is capable to handle

168
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:36,550
the flow's bidirectional flows.

169
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:38,061
Then we talk about

170
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:41,261
the service's layer,

171
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:45,393
smart urban energy services.

172
00:07:45,593 --> 00:07:47,422
Basically meaning that

173
00:07:47,622 --> 00:07:49,641
 we don't just have a consumer.

174
00:07:49,841 --> 00:07:51,952
Consumers are at the same time

175
00:07:52,152 --> 00:07:53,834
prosumers. 

176
00:07:53,971 --> 00:07:57,354
And the services 
become much more complex.

177
00:07:57,554 --> 00:08:02,370
Not just simply buying electricity. 

178
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:04,982
It's also about saving electricity,

179
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:06,326
about managing,

180
00:08:09,028 --> 00:08:12,028


181
00:08:09,726 --> 00:08:11,957
And then at the core of it

182
00:08:12,157 --> 00:08:13,846
is of course the digital,

183
00:08:14,046 --> 00:08:15,478
or the data layer,

184
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:18,678
which makes these 
kinds of things possible.

185
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:22,325
Which makes smart urban
energy systems possible.

186
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,414
So we will, from here

187
00:08:24,614 --> 00:08:26,492
go into these three layers

188
00:08:26,607 --> 00:08:27,376
in detail.

189
00:08:27,725 --> 00:08:30,011
Stay tuned.
