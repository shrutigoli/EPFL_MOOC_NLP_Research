00:00:05,494 --> 00:00:06,707
Hello. 
And welcome back to the course. 

2
00:00:06,983 --> 00:00:08,787
Today I have the pleasure of talking

3
00:00:09,008 --> 00:00:10,795
to Professor Mario Paolone,

4
00:00:10,995 --> 00:00:16,037
who is chairing the Distributed
Electrical Systems Laboratory at EPFL.

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,658
He's an expert on 
the topic of smart grids, 

6
00:00:18,908 --> 00:00:21,019
and he's doing 
very interesting research at EPFL. 

7
00:00:21,245 --> 00:00:23,330
Thank you very much, Mario
for being with us. 

8
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,858
It's a pleasure Mohamad, 
to be with you.

9
00:00:26,058 --> 00:00:29,008
As the first question, 
I would like to ask you

10
00:00:29,208 --> 00:00:33,420
about the key challenges in managing
smart grids for cities?

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:37,133
Okay. Well, in smart grids as you know,

12
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:42,712
there is a built in assumption 
mainly, that a big fraction  

13
00:00:42,945 --> 00:00:47,083
of the electricity is being generated 
in a distributed manner.

14
00:00:47,283 --> 00:00:52,958
Essentially true in renewables, mainly PVs, 
that can be roof top

15
00:00:53,195 --> 00:00:56,672
can be centralized power plants,
wind turbines, etc.

16
00:00:56,872 --> 00:01:01,884
Now, the integration of these resources
poses two challenges.

17
00:01:02,084 --> 00:01:06,602
The first one is that 
these resources are not centralized,

18
00:01:06,802 --> 00:01:09,221
namely, they are dispersed 
on the territory.

19
00:01:09,421 --> 00:01:14,245
They are very large in number,
and they are stochastic.

20
00:01:14,445 --> 00:01:18,145
In the sense that they are
difficult to control. 

21
00:01:18,345 --> 00:01:20,034
Not from the technical point of view,

22
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:23,632
but from the aggregated perspective.

23
00:01:23,832 --> 00:01:28,487
Therefore, there are 
two essential requirements

24
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:31,632
in technology needs of smart grids.

25
00:01:31,832 --> 00:01:36,712
The first one are the tools 
that we call situation awareness tools.

26
00:01:36,912 --> 00:01:41,679
Essentially, you need to have 
a way to provide the sensing

27
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:44,253
as well as the  situation awareness 

28
00:01:44,453 --> 00:01:46,913
to automators, or to operators

29
00:01:47,113 --> 00:01:51,040
that knows exactly 
which is the status of the asset

30
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:55,842
in quasi real-time, and with a
very high refresh rate.

31
00:01:56,042 --> 00:01:59,213
A refresh rate that I can mention 
are in the range of 

32
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:02,737
tens or hundreds of milliseconds. 
Okay?

33
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:05,157
In systems which are pretty big in size,

34
00:02:05,357 --> 00:02:07,758
that can be a neighbourhood, a city,

35
00:02:08,008 --> 00:02:10,199
a country, 
or even an entire continent. 

36
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,236
So, that's the first requirement,
to observe

37
00:02:13,436 --> 00:02:15,611
and to sense the system status. 

38
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:19,620
A little bit is how 
automatic cars are doing

39
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,506
with the technology called auto-pilots. 

40
00:02:21,706 --> 00:02:24,834
You have to build the kind of situation
which is surrounding the vehicle. 

41
00:02:25,034 --> 00:02:27,781
The second requirement, the second
technological requirement 

42
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:31,562
is the capability 
to control the systems

43
00:02:31,762 --> 00:02:36,829
with bulk stochastic generation
in a controlled fashion.

44
00:02:37,029 --> 00:02:39,838
And this means to use storage. 

45
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:43,386
The set where we are now, 
it's a battery. 

46
00:02:43,586 --> 00:02:45,109
It's a Lithium titanium battery.

47
00:02:45,309 --> 00:02:47,441
And this is one 
of the asset that we need

48
00:02:47,641 --> 00:02:51,693
in future smart grids
to enable the controllability

49
00:02:51,893 --> 00:02:55,473
of stochastic resources, 
to be able to control,

50
00:02:55,673 --> 00:02:59,324
to provide services to the power system
at the local level.

51
00:02:59,524 --> 00:03:02,230
And this, the second element, 
that you need to develop.

52
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,573
Good. 
As the second question,

53
00:03:04,773 --> 00:03:07,950
you mentioned the role of technology
called challenges that we have.

54
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:09,678
But can you also 
elaborate a little bit more

55
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:11,921
on how technology 
is also providing  

56
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:13,951
the solution for these challenges?

57
00:03:14,163 --> 00:03:16,570
Yeah. I go back to the 
first technological aspect/dimension

58
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,923
namely the sensing.

59
00:03:19,123 --> 00:03:24,944
I make you a comparison with the - 
again, the example of a car. Okay?

60
00:03:25,119 --> 00:03:28,067
So in the car you have a system
that has a physical system.

61
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:32,276
That's a size of a few meters. 

62
00:03:32,476 --> 00:03:34,329
So, the sensors are
essentially located

63
00:03:34,529 --> 00:03:36,420
nearby each other. 

64
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,736
So, you don't need 
to synchronize them.

65
00:03:38,936 --> 00:03:41,509
Because the physical dimension 
of the system is rather small.

66
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:44,622
In power systems, in smart grids

67
00:03:44,822 --> 00:03:48,806
as I said, your system can have
the minimum size of a neighborhood,

68
00:03:49,006 --> 00:03:51,262
or it can go up to a country,
or a continent.

69
00:03:51,462 --> 00:03:56,005
Now, if you sense quantities which are

70
00:03:56,205 --> 00:03:59,613
that are collected in a fashion,

71
00:03:59,813 --> 00:04:02,613
in points which are separated 
by kilometers, 

72
00:04:02,813 --> 00:04:04,497
or hundreds of kilometers.

73
00:04:04,697 --> 00:04:06,489
You know speed of light is finite. 

74
00:04:06,664 --> 00:04:10,100
So, you end up in having delays 

75
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,653
in collecting this information. 

76
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:15,316
So, what we typically do 
is that we adopt

77
00:04:15,516 --> 00:04:18,392
state of the art 
time synchronism mechanism,

78
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:23,132
that can be either GPS,
namely satellite synchronization system.

79
00:04:23,332 --> 00:04:27,056
Satellite like GPS, GLONASS, 
or Galileo systems,

80
00:04:27,256 --> 00:04:29,568
or can be time synchronisms

81
00:04:29,768 --> 00:04:31,817
which are brought into the internet.

82
00:04:32,017 --> 00:04:35,359
There are protocols called
Precision Time Protocols,

83
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:38,035
PTP technologies, that you typically use

84
00:04:38,235 --> 00:04:39,923
to synchronize the clock 
of your computer, right?

85
00:04:40,637 --> 00:04:43,547
With time accuracy 
which is relatively low

86
00:04:43,747 --> 00:04:49,367
we look for technologies which are
much more deterministic than this one. 

87
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:51,985
For instance, 
we are taking a technology

88
00:04:52,185 --> 00:04:57,576
that is used by CERN
to synchronize their oscilloscopes

89
00:04:57,776 --> 00:05:00,357
on the Large Hadron Collider,
is called the White Rabbit, 

90
00:05:00,557 --> 00:05:01,880
the name of this protocol.

91
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,868
And we are taking it and adapting

92
00:05:04,068 --> 00:05:05,961
to time synchronization
in smart grids. 

93
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:08,449
With these kinds of protocol,
you typically have jitters

94
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:11,398
of the measurements 
in the range of few nanoseconds.

95
00:05:11,598 --> 00:05:16,060
So this enables you to collect
and time align

96
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:20,861
all your measurements, and then feed 
the situational awareness tools

97
00:05:21,061 --> 00:05:24,584
that are essentially reconstructing
the system state

98
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:28,062
with a very high fidelity 
and a very high frame rate.

99
00:05:28,262 --> 00:05:31,500
So, that's the first kind
of technology that we make use.

100
00:05:32,482 --> 00:05:35,380
What do you do once we have that?

101
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,624
Essentially, you share 
this situation

102
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,826
of your system
with the automators.

103
00:05:41,038 --> 00:05:44,332
And the automators are essentially 
local intelligence

104
00:05:44,532 --> 00:05:49,248
that are taking 
the control of your small asset,

105
00:05:49,448 --> 00:05:53,062
your small TV, this battery, 
a controllable load,

106
00:05:53,262 --> 00:05:55,356
analytical vehicle charger,
and whatsoever.

107
00:05:55,556 --> 00:05:58,775
So, you share this to the system,
and these devices

108
00:05:58,975 --> 00:06:01,091
they, by knowing the state 
of the system

109
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,643
they essentially 
take intelligent action

110
00:06:02,843 --> 00:06:04,948
by negotiating each other. Okay?

111
00:06:05,148 --> 00:06:07,777
So, this is more on
the software development part.

112
00:06:07,977 --> 00:06:10,971
Then you need also physical systems,

113
00:06:11,171 --> 00:06:12,405
like this battery.

114
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:17,127
As I said, having the capacity,
the capability

115
00:06:17,327 --> 00:06:20,888
of storing energy 
in a very efficient way

116
00:06:21,088 --> 00:06:25,338
and release it in a, 
also controllable way,

117
00:06:25,538 --> 00:06:27,238
it's one of the key aspects
of smart grids.

118
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:31,444
So this kind of battery was 
not really imaginable few years ago. 

119
00:06:31,644 --> 00:06:35,332
It's a device 
that has round-trip efficiency

120
00:06:35,532 --> 00:06:37,934
above 95 percent. Okay?

121
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:39,150
Just to give you a number. 

122
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:43,147
Irrespective of the state of charge, 
and of the power

123
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:45,324
that you are extracting or injecting
into the system.

124
00:06:45,524 --> 00:06:49,207
It has a ramp rate,
so it can generate a ramp of power

125
00:06:49,407 --> 00:06:53,693
of about 20 megawatts a second,
which is a ramp of power

126
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:58,368
which is very similar to 
state of the art large turbines.

127
00:06:58,568 --> 00:07:01,214
But this is an asset 
that you can take and move it.

128
00:07:01,414 --> 00:07:04,375
So, it's a very peculiar system.

129
00:07:04,575 --> 00:07:07,690
And the third aspect 
that you have is that the cost

130
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,646
of this kind of technology 
is going to be down

131
00:07:10,846 --> 00:07:13,282
with the almost aquadratic law

132
00:07:13,482 --> 00:07:15,090
So if you look at the cost 
of this device,

133
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:18,530
was in the range of several thousands
of Swiss Francs,

134
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:21,644
or Euros if you want,
a few years ago,

135
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:26,217
Now we are talking about hundreds 
of US dollars per kilowatt hour. 

136
00:07:27,642 --> 00:07:30,873
And, last but not least,
the life cycle of these devices.

137
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:37,205
This asset in particular can do 
more than 15,000 cycles.

138
00:07:37,405 --> 00:07:39,721
So if you measure to a cycle a day

139
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:44,634
it will last 15,000 days,
namely several decades.

140
00:07:45,697 --> 00:07:50,098
Which is a good aspect,
and fundamental aspect for utilities.

141
00:07:50,298 --> 00:07:53,524
Because in the power industry,
the assets, 

142
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:56,146
typically, they last 
for 20, 25 years.

143
00:07:56,346 --> 00:07:59,082
So having a storage system 
can have similar performances

144
00:07:59,282 --> 00:08:01,622
in terms of life cycle, 
it's fundamental.

145
00:08:01,822 --> 00:08:04,814
Great.
So the technology is somehow there

146
00:08:05,014 --> 00:08:06,738
you know, to have the smart grids. 

147
00:08:06,938 --> 00:08:09,979
But also, you know, the institutions, 
regulation, and management 

148
00:08:10,179 --> 00:08:13,169
is often a challenge 
in these socio-technical systems.

149
00:08:13,369 --> 00:08:15,764
Can you elaborate a little bit 
on the managerial

150
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:18,408
and regulation challenges 
in smart grids?

151
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,351
That's also very good question. 

152
00:08:20,551 --> 00:08:21,853
So talking about this asset, 
 

153
00:08:22,026 --> 00:08:23,525
for instance, 
we're talking about energy storage. 

154
00:08:23,725 --> 00:08:28,315
So typically, these kind of devices 
will be used by power utilities.

155
00:08:28,515 --> 00:08:31,666
Which are not supposed 
to own energy storage

156
00:08:31,866 --> 00:08:34,370
because you know 
in unbundled markets

157
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,129
they can do energy arbitration. 

158
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:39,065
In the sense, 
they can influence the demand

159
00:08:39,265 --> 00:08:42,712
and they can purchase energy 
and store energy.

160
00:08:42,912 --> 00:08:44,133
When if the market is very cheap, 

161
00:08:44,382 --> 00:08:47,032
they can know it in advance 
and then resell the energy  

162
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:49,948
when the prices are higher,
to their customers.

163
00:08:50,148 --> 00:08:54,222
So this kind of asset 
which are meant to add flexibility 

164
00:08:54,422 --> 00:08:58,923
to the systems, 
they should be using a different way.

165
00:08:59,123 --> 00:09:03,169
In this specific case, 
the regulatory bodies

166
00:09:03,369 --> 00:09:06,649
that have to develop tools 
to certify

167
00:09:06,849 --> 00:09:12,495
that these kind of assets are used 
only to avoid grid reinforcement,

168
00:09:12,695 --> 00:09:15,942
namely in support of the grid,
and not to do energy arbitration.

169
00:09:16,142 --> 00:09:17,430
Just to make an example.

170
00:09:18,383 --> 00:09:22,630
The second example 
I can make about regulatory needs,

171
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:25,255
is about the use of smart meters, 
for instance.

172
00:09:25,455 --> 00:09:30,181
In situational systems, 
nowadays technology allows us to infer

173
00:09:30,381 --> 00:09:35,748
the state of the system, including
the nodal power injection absorption's,

174
00:09:35,948 --> 00:09:39,105
even if you don't directly meter it.

175
00:09:39,305 --> 00:09:42,266
Which means I can observe 
what the customer is doing

176
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:45,015
even if I don't place a meter 
in his house.

177
00:09:45,215 --> 00:09:50,661
And this might generate 
privacy issues and discussions

178
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:53,000
for this kind of application.

179
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:55,491
So, yep, there is a lot  to do. 

180
00:09:56,457 --> 00:10:00,116
And last, but not least,
it's how the regulatory board

181
00:10:00,316 --> 00:10:05,553
will fraction and divide 
the costs of the grid

182
00:10:05,753 --> 00:10:08,173
between transmission, distribution,
(INAUDIBLE).

183
00:10:08,373 --> 00:10:11,759
Having these kinds of assets 
means that you give to the operators

184
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:15,778
the opportunity 
to locally balance the power flows.

185
00:10:15,978 --> 00:10:19,369
Meaning that the transmission system 
will be used less in the future,

186
00:10:19,569 --> 00:10:22,805
but with a cost 
that the rent will be even higher.

187
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:24,576
So, who is paying for this cost?

188
00:10:24,776 --> 00:10:27,730
How we transfer these costs 
to the customers, 

189
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:28,928
with which mechanisms?

190
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,101
These are questions that I don't know 
whether are still open.

191
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:33,839
Great.
Thank you very much Mario.

192
00:10:34,039 --> 00:10:36,397
It was very insightful 
for our participants.

193
00:10:36,597 --> 00:10:39,914
Thank you Mohamed, 
and thank you again for the invitation.
