00:00:05,471 --> 00:00:07,583
Welcome to the second week.

2
00:00:07,809 --> 00:00:12,734
During this week, we will talk 
about smart urban energy systems. 

3
00:00:13,841 --> 00:00:16,378
The week is structured as follows:

4
00:00:16,588 --> 00:00:20,601
First, we will conceptualize smart 
urban energy systems.

5
00:00:20,807 --> 00:00:24,320
putting them into the larger context
of urban systems 

6
00:00:24,517 --> 00:00:28,055
and there will be an interview
with an urban utility company. 

7
00:00:28,245 --> 00:00:30,945
Then we will take our three layers. 

8
00:00:31,137 --> 00:00:34,200
First the energy 
infrastructure layer, 

9
00:00:34,414 --> 00:00:36,364
and here also, 
we will have an interview

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,732
with an expert on smart grids. 

11
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:42,091
Then we will talk about 
the energy services layer, 

12
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:44,979
and after that, we'll talk about 
the data layer,

13
00:00:45,165 --> 00:00:47,040
 or the digital layer.

14
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:50,242
There will be also an interview 
with a global firm

15
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,842
that is active in 
smart energy systems. 

16
00:00:54,055 --> 00:00:56,993
And finally, 
I will conclude the week

17
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:01,006
talking about the managerial 
and policy takeaways.
