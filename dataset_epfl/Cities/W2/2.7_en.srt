1
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:06,961
Welcome back.

2
00:00:07,527 --> 00:00:12,240
Now to conclude this second week,
we are gong to talk about 

3
00:00:12,435 --> 00:00:15,636
the managerial and policy 
takeaways

4
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:20,665
from our discussion about 
smart urban energy systems. 

5
00:00:20,864 --> 00:00:24,152
Let's first talk about 
the managerial takeaways.

6
00:00:24,356 --> 00:00:27,243
And we have structured this 
along the three layers 

7
00:00:27,435 --> 00:00:30,560
and the main relevant dimensions. 

8
00:00:30,801 --> 00:00:34,801
So the first big challenge 
for managers

9
00:00:35,021 --> 00:00:39,334
from a technological perspective 
is of course 

10
00:00:39,549 --> 00:00:42,061
the question of great stability. 

11
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:43,735
Because of intermittency, 

12
00:00:43,957 --> 00:00:46,607
because of renewable 
decentralized production, 

13
00:00:46,833 --> 00:00:51,584
because of price signals and 
increasingly volatile price signals,

14
00:00:51,805 --> 00:00:55,780
the whole grid stability becomes,
I would say, 

15
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:01,027
the main challenge for urban, 
smart urban energy systems managers.

16
00:01:02,106 --> 00:01:05,331
Then from an economic perspective,

17
00:01:05,541 --> 00:01:08,929
there is the whole question
of allocating the cost

18
00:01:09,155 --> 00:01:12,155
of moving to smart
urban energy systems.

19
00:01:12,357 --> 00:01:15,583
The upgrading that 
need to be done,

20
00:01:15,816 --> 00:01:18,504
who ultimately pays for what?

21
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:24,494
On the services layer, 
it's normally an economic question 

22
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:30,109
in the sense of these 
smart urban energy services,

23
00:01:30,338 --> 00:01:34,113
what are the underlying businesses 
of these services, 

24
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:36,266
who will pay for these services, 

25
00:01:36,463 --> 00:01:38,151
who wants to pay for the services, 

26
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,081
is there a market for the services?

27
00:01:41,317 --> 00:01:43,805
And more from 
a social perspective, 

28
00:01:44,042 --> 00:01:47,229
this is the question of 
user acceptance 

29
00:01:47,426 --> 00:01:49,763
or ultimately, user uptake. 

30
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:53,380
Will they use or buy
these kind of services?

31
00:01:54,244 --> 00:01:58,295
On the data layer, 
there are technological questions 

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,217
in terms of status standards, 

33
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:07,058
interoperability of data 
and questions of data security 

34
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,558
that managers have to face. 

35
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:13,219
And finally, also from 
an economic perspective, 

36
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,657
this is the whole question 
of the pricing of the data.

37
00:02:16,869 --> 00:02:20,181
What is the right pricing 
of this data 

38
00:02:20,378 --> 00:02:24,365
so that ultimately the market
will uptake the services 

39
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:29,314
and at the same time, 
the cost for upgrading,

40
00:02:29,530 --> 00:02:33,430
for moving into a smart 
urban energy systems are covered.

41
00:02:34,626 --> 00:02:38,463
So let's now look the takeaways 
for policy makers 

42
00:02:38,677 --> 00:02:41,328
along the same structure 
as previously;

43
00:02:41,549 --> 00:02:44,561
the different layers, 
the different dimensions.

44
00:02:44,773 --> 00:02:47,386
I think the first challenge 
for policy makers 

45
00:02:47,586 --> 00:02:51,136
are the whole question 
of legacy cost.

46
00:02:51,419 --> 00:02:56,793
We have traditional energy systems, 
big power plans, 

47
00:02:57,021 --> 00:03:00,458
transmission grid,
costly transmission grids,

48
00:03:00,679 --> 00:03:04,504
and as a result of 
smart urban energy systems, 

49
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:07,679
more independent may be 
less consumption,

50
00:03:07,887 --> 00:03:12,599
the question comes up as to who 
bears these legacy costs

51
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:17,024
and how to finance 
these legacy costs.

52
00:03:17,248 --> 00:03:21,535
Then, more from 
a jurisdictional perspective, 

53
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:28,158
it is of course also the question
of the relative independence

54
00:03:28,352 --> 00:03:30,727
of an urban energy system, 

55
00:03:30,967 --> 00:03:34,192
We know that all energy 
and electricity systems 

56
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:37,104
are interconnected with each other

57
00:03:37,318 --> 00:03:40,606
and so the question, 
the policy question here 

58
00:03:40,805 --> 00:03:43,405
is really what is 
the relevant entity?

59
00:03:43,612 --> 00:03:46,987
Is it the city in itself, 
but we know that the city 

60
00:03:47,188 --> 00:03:51,688
is a political entity and often 
from a system perspective 

61
00:03:51,896 --> 00:03:54,146
does not necessarily make sense.

62
00:03:54,402 --> 00:03:56,927
May be more the metropolitan 
area here. 

63
00:03:57,953 --> 00:04:00,116
On the services layer, 

64
00:04:00,285 --> 00:04:05,397
and from an economic perspective, 
there is the whole question

65
00:04:05,613 --> 00:04:09,625
of regulating certain services

66
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:13,327
and certain prices of services, 
for example, 

67
00:04:13,548 --> 00:04:16,548
we have seen that balancing services

68
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:20,130
is one of the smart urban 
energy services 

69
00:04:20,338 --> 00:04:23,238
that is being offered, 
but balancing energy 

70
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:27,568
is heavily regulated, 
and so there  is policy action 

71
00:04:27,783 --> 00:04:30,796
and policy is challenged also 
in this area. 

72
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,920
From the social perspective, 
there's the whole question

73
00:04:34,135 --> 00:04:36,860
of Universal Services Obligation. 

74
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:41,580
Is there a minimum amount of energy,
smart urban energy services,

75
00:04:41,752 --> 00:04:45,065
that the citizens are entitled to, 

76
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:48,877
at what price, 
how affordable is it, 

77
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:52,058
when can they be cut off, 
for example?

78
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:55,599
And then on the data layer, 
there are a series

79
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:57,361
 of policy questions

80
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:02,118
The question from
a technological perspective,

81
00:05:02,312 --> 00:05:05,100
it's also the question 
of access to data,

82
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:09,211
rights of access to data.

83
00:05:09,403 --> 00:05:13,078
On economic, 
from an economic perspective,

84
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,766
it's the whole question
of data ownership. 

85
00:05:15,975 --> 00:05:17,763
Who owns the data?

86
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:20,952
What are the prices for that data, 

87
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:24,782
and then, of course, the whole
question of financing 

88
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:27,890
the different digital 
infrastructures 

89
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:30,623
that have to be put into place. 

90
00:05:30,849 --> 00:05:34,724
On the social side, I think the big 
policy challenges 

91
00:05:34,941 --> 00:05:37,366
are privacy, which of course, 
will affect

92
00:05:37,579 --> 00:05:42,517
whether the users will ultimately
use the services or not. 

93
00:05:42,723 --> 00:05:46,798
And to conclude, I think 
the most fundamental questions

94
00:05:46,995 --> 00:05:49,870
that policy makers have 
to ask themselves

95
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:53,460
is whether they want consider
in an urban system 

96
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:59,287
that the data on smart 
urban energy data as a good,

97
00:05:59,482 --> 00:06:02,944
as a commercial good, 
or as a platform,

98
00:06:03,128 --> 00:06:07,141
and this kind of question 
will have the answer 

99
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:08,663
to this kind of question,

100
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:11,645
will have huge regulatory 
implications 

101
00:06:11,862 --> 00:06:15,712
which then policy makers 
will have to follow up on. 

102
00:06:16,454 --> 00:06:19,579
To conclude this second week, 

103
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:24,428
we have seen the three main layers 
of smart urban energy systems.

104
00:06:24,622 --> 00:06:26,709
We have talked about 
the infrastructure layer,

105
00:06:26,884 --> 00:06:29,396
the services layer 
and the data layer 

106
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:34,074
and have illustrated this 
with a series of presentations 

107
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:36,717
and interviews with experts. 

108
00:06:36,937 --> 00:06:41,337
Then, we have seen what the main
managerial and policy 

109
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:43,661
takeaways are form this.

110
00:06:43,923 --> 00:06:46,923
Now, in the next week, 
we will talk about

111
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:50,013
smart urban transportation systems. 

112
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,999
So stay tuned.
