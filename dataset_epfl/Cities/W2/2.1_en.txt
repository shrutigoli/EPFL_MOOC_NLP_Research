Welcome to the second week.
During this week, we will talk about smart urban energy systems. 
The week is structured as follows:
First, we will conceptualize smart urban energy systems. putting them into the larger context of urban systems and there will be an interview with an urban utility company. 
Then we will take our three layers.

Then we will talk about the energy services layer, and after that, we'll talk about the data layer,
 or the digital layer.
There will be also an interview with a global firm that is active in smart energy systems.
