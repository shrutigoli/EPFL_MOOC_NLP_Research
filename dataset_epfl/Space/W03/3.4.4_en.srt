1
00:00:05,980 --> 00:00:09,191
Let's talk now
about the rendezvous profile,

2
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:14,572
the profile of the orbit 
of the chaser versus a target

3
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:20,092
is basically represented 
in a one-dimensional plane

4
00:00:20,092 --> 00:00:22,519
which is a plane
of the orbit of the target,

5
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:24,469
at least a plane 
of the orbit of the target

6
00:00:24,469 --> 00:00:26,476
at the end of the rendezvous.

7
00:00:26,476 --> 00:00:29,878
There is one important parameter, 
which is phase angle <i>φ</i>.

8
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:33,745
It's the angle between the radius vector

9
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:36,810
from the center
of the Earth to the chaser,

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:38,972
and the other radius vector

11
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:41,584
from the center of the Earth
to the target.

12
00:00:42,232 --> 00:00:44,388
<i>φ</i> can be relatively large

13
00:00:44,388 --> 00:00:47,388
at installation 
of the chaser into its orbit

14
00:00:47,388 --> 00:00:50,206
its orbit is always below

15
00:00:50,206 --> 00:00:53,941
and, of course, behind the target,

16
00:00:54,676 --> 00:00:58,911
so the chaser will chase the target 
coming from behind and below.

17
00:00:58,911 --> 00:01:00,537
And the phase angle <i>φ</i>,

18
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:04,227
which, again, can be 180 degrees 
or even more,

19
00:01:04,227 --> 00:01:08,882
initially will come down 
until it gets to zero

20
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:10,642
at the time of rendezvous itself.

21
00:01:10,937 --> 00:01:15,497
The phasing rate, or catch-up rate, 
is time derivative of the <i>φ</i> angle,

22
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:19,367
and, of course, the phasing rate 
is a function of the differential altitude

23
00:01:19,367 --> 00:01:21,157
because of the third Kepler's law.

24
00:01:21,157 --> 00:01:24,925
The low orbit of the chaser 
makes it catch up with the target.

25
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:29,617
But, of course, we have also to change 
the energy of the orbit of the chaser

26
00:01:29,617 --> 00:01:31,815
and come to a higher altitude,

27
00:01:31,815 --> 00:01:33,780
at the altitude of the orbit of the target

28
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,450
to complete the rendezvous.

29
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,380
The coordinate system we'll use
to represent the motion

30
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:42,103
of the chaser versus the target
is the following.

31
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:45,387
And it's important 
to give a clear consideration of that.

32
00:01:45,387 --> 00:01:49,207
We have the coordinate system 
centered on the target,

33
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:54,589
with <i>Z</i>, the vertical axis 
to the center of the Earth.

34
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,903
We have the <i>X</i> axis in the direction 
of motion of the target

35
00:01:58,903 --> 00:02:00,743
and the direction of the velocity vector,

36
00:02:00,743 --> 00:02:04,690
and we will, out of convention,
always have the velocity vector

37
00:02:04,690 --> 00:02:07,875
of the target and of the chaser also,
to the left on the picture.

38
00:02:08,415 --> 00:02:12,997
Now, we have the chaser which is below 
and behind the target.

39
00:02:12,997 --> 00:02:15,540
Of course, its velocity vector 
has an amplitude

40
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,070
which is larger than the amplitude 
of the velocity of the target,

41
00:02:19,070 --> 00:02:22,819
because it is lower,
so this is the <i>V_chaser</i>.

42
00:02:25,242 --> 00:02:28,962
So it is going to be slowly 
catching up with the target.

43
00:02:30,147 --> 00:02:32,563
Now, the coordinate system 
we talked about before

44
00:02:32,563 --> 00:02:35,363
is represented in the lower left here

45
00:02:35,363 --> 00:02:38,403
and, in fact, the way we represent it

46
00:02:38,403 --> 00:02:41,794
either way you have it 
on the upper right of the picture,

47
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,224
we will put the Earth's surface being flat

48
00:02:44,224 --> 00:02:47,443
and we'll put the <i>X</i> axis, 
which is, in fact, curvilinear,

49
00:02:47,443 --> 00:02:49,840
we'll put it 
as a straight horizontal line

50
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:54,230
with <i>X</i> to the left in the direction 
of the velocity vector of the target.

51
00:02:55,548 --> 00:02:58,134
This is the way we'll have all our plots

52
00:02:58,134 --> 00:03:00,804
of the motion of the chaser 
versus the target

53
00:03:00,804 --> 00:03:04,181
done in the next sessions.

54
00:03:04,181 --> 00:03:05,762
So, again, we have the chaser

55
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:10,812
with an initial horizontal
velocity vector <i>V_chaser</i>

56
00:03:13,661 --> 00:03:16,812
with a larger amplitude than the <i>V_TGT</i>.

57
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:20,610
So if you don't do anything,
we will have the chaser

58
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:23,558
just passing below the target,

59
00:03:23,558 --> 00:03:25,593
horizontally below the target.

60
00:03:25,593 --> 00:03:28,811
Obviously this is not 
a properly completed rendezvous,

61
00:03:28,811 --> 00:03:31,718
but this is part of it,
and we will see what we do

62
00:03:31,718 --> 00:03:35,262
in order to really perform
the rendezvous between chaser and target.

63
00:03:35,652 --> 00:03:39,987
Again, roughly 
between 6 hours and 48 hours

64
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:42,317
after lift-off of the chaser.

65
00:03:43,893 --> 00:03:46,495
Now, this is out of NASA documentation:

66
00:03:46,495 --> 00:03:49,409
the rendezvous profile

67
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:52,009
of the Space Shuttle with the target.

68
00:03:52,009 --> 00:03:55,289
And the target, again, could be 
either the Hubble Space Telescope

69
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:58,059
or the International Space Station

70
00:03:58,059 --> 00:04:02,980
from the the point designated MECO. 
MECO is Main Engine CutOff.

71
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:06,678
It's 8.5 minutes after lift-off
of the Space Shuttle,

72
00:04:06,678 --> 00:04:10,013
when it has reached orbital velocity,

73
00:04:10,013 --> 00:04:14,443
and right after that 
we have separation of the external tank,

74
00:04:14,443 --> 00:04:16,521
and the Shuttle is just by itself.

75
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:20,403
Now, it happened that at MECO, 
the orbit of the Space Shuttle

76
00:04:20,403 --> 00:04:24,201
is an elliptical orbit 
that will have its apogee

77
00:04:24,201 --> 00:04:26,016
at this point here.

78
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,024
So we go from this altitude
to that altitude

79
00:04:29,024 --> 00:04:33,489
between main engine cutoff
and the apogee of these orbits.

80
00:04:33,489 --> 00:04:36,798
Now, this orbit is represented 
in this coordinate frame

81
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:40,888
centered on the target 
on the upper left of the picture

82
00:04:40,888 --> 00:04:43,863
with the horizontal axis, or the <i>X</i> axis,

83
00:04:43,863 --> 00:04:47,693
which has the same distance 
to the surface of the Earth

84
00:04:47,693 --> 00:04:51,382
and vertical axis 
is designated here, <i>R bar</i>,

85
00:04:51,382 --> 00:04:53,348
it's toward the center of the Earth.

86
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:55,776
The <i>X</i> axis, in the NASA language,

87
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:59,088
is sometimes designated as a <i>V bar</i> axis.

88
00:04:59,886 --> 00:05:04,398
So we are on this elliptical orbit 
that has the apogee

89
00:05:07,326 --> 00:05:08,950
at this altitude,

90
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:14,572
still below the circular orbit altitude
of the target

91
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:17,761
At this point we perform 
a so-called OMS-2 maneuver

92
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:23,234
which is a <i>ΔV</i> posigrade, <i>ΔV</i> 
in the direction of the velocity vector

93
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:25,754
in order to raise the perigee.

94
00:05:25,754 --> 00:05:29,835
So at this point we are 
on a new elliptical orbit of the Shuttle

95
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:34,084
which has the perigee at this point,
and the apogee at that point.

96
00:05:34,211 --> 00:05:37,894
Now, you have to note that the <i>a</i> value

97
00:05:37,894 --> 00:05:39,604
or the semi-major axis

98
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:44,750
of the elliptical orbit of the Shuttle 
at this point is here,

99
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:49,480
it's just the average value 
of the apogee and perigee altitude.

100
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:55,961
Of course, <i>a</i> is here smaller than <i>r</i>,

101
00:05:56,432 --> 00:06:00,575
<i>r</i> is the radius of the circular orbit 
of the target.

102
00:06:00,863 --> 00:06:05,781
Now, remember we looked previously 
at the catch-up rate

103
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:07,831
of the chaser versus the target

104
00:06:07,831 --> 00:06:10,556
when we have a difference between <i>r</i> and <i>a</i>.

105
00:06:10,556 --> 00:06:14,927
Basically as a first approximation 
we have for each orbit <i>ΔX</i>,

106
00:06:14,927 --> 00:06:18,393
<i>ΔX</i> in this direction towards the left,

107
00:06:18,393 --> 00:06:22,146
will be <i>3 π (r - a)</i>

108
00:06:22,146 --> 00:06:26,814
As <i>r - a</i> is positive here, 
we will have a general motion

109
00:06:26,814 --> 00:06:29,000
towards the left of the Space Shuttle.

110
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:32,399
Now, it just happens that we perform 
a certain number of maneuvers

111
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,889
called NC-1, NC-2, NPC-1.

112
00:06:34,889 --> 00:06:37,501
I won't go into
the exact description of these,

113
00:06:37,501 --> 00:06:40,821
but the idea is to increase slowly

114
00:06:40,821 --> 00:06:43,351
the energy of the orbit of the chaser.

115
00:06:43,351 --> 00:06:47,895
At this point we have the transformation 
of our elliptical orbit here

116
00:06:47,895 --> 00:06:51,230
with perigee here and apogee here
into a circular orbit

117
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:55,116
with a constant distance 
to the surface of the Earth.

118
00:06:55,116 --> 00:07:00,188
Then we go, again, to an elliptical orbit 
with the apogee here and the perigee here,

119
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:05,558
so we really gradually increase 
the energy of the orbit of the chaser,

120
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:09,424
respectively we increase the value of <i>a</i>, 
the semi-major axis

121
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:14,499
until we come to a point here,
the NC4 point,

122
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:19,392
where we have the apogee 
of the elliptical orbit of the chaser

123
00:07:19,392 --> 00:07:23,622
at the altitude of the circular orbit
of the target.

124
00:07:25,597 --> 00:07:28,142
Here we are, NC4,
and that's interesting to see

125
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:31,534
that we have kind of a loop here.
And why do we have a loop?

126
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,807
So that the motion of the chaser 
versus the target

127
00:07:35,807 --> 00:07:39,014
when we get to this NC4 point

128
00:07:39,014 --> 00:07:41,008
is toward the right,

129
00:07:41,008 --> 00:07:44,912
and it's pretty obvious,
because the relative motion

130
00:07:44,912 --> 00:07:47,292
of chaser versus the target to the right

131
00:07:47,292 --> 00:07:50,792
means that we have a lower velocity 
of the chaser

132
00:07:50,792 --> 00:07:54,242
when it reaches the altitude 
of the circular orbit of the target

133
00:07:54,242 --> 00:07:55,934
than the target itself.

134
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:59,070
And it's obvious, because the value of <i>a</i>,

135
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:02,264
of the elliptical orbit of the chaser,

136
00:08:02,264 --> 00:08:05,689
which is about here. This is <i>a</i>.

137
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:09,035
This is the perigee of the orbit,
this is the apogee.

138
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:12,373
The value of <i>a</i> is smaller than <i>r</i>,

139
00:08:12,373 --> 00:08:15,203
the radius of the circular orbit 
of the target.

140
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:20,781
So we know
that the energy per unit mass,

141
00:08:20,781 --> 00:08:25,121
<i>ε = - μ / 2a</i>.

142
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:29,194
So, if we have <i>a</i> which is smaller, 
the energy is less,

143
00:08:29,194 --> 00:08:32,617
and at this point, the NC4 point,

144
00:08:32,617 --> 00:08:37,995
the potential energy of both the target 
and the chaser is the same,

145
00:08:37,995 --> 00:08:40,072
because we're at the same altitude,

146
00:08:40,072 --> 00:08:45,234
and as the <i>a</i> of the orbit 
of the chaser is less than the <i>r</i>,

147
00:08:45,234 --> 00:08:48,391
radius of the circular orbit 
of the target,

148
00:08:48,391 --> 00:08:52,495
then we have less total energy 
for the chaser,

149
00:08:52,495 --> 00:08:55,331
which means that we have less velocity.

150
00:08:55,331 --> 00:08:59,129
And in these plots,
or in this coordinate system,

151
00:08:59,129 --> 00:09:00,157
centered on the target,

152
00:09:00,157 --> 00:09:02,924
it means that we have
to have a motion to the right.

153
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:05,092
But rapidly afterwards, 
when it comes down

154
00:09:05,092 --> 00:09:08,343
toward the perigee 
of the new orbit of the chaser,

155
00:09:08,343 --> 00:09:12,689
we come here, at the perigee 
of the orbit of the chaser,

156
00:09:12,689 --> 00:09:15,777
and we end up again at this point, <i>T_i</i>,

157
00:09:15,777 --> 00:09:19,007
point behind the target

158
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:21,408
still at the same altitude.

159
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:26,122
Now, we need to do something here, 
because if we would not do anything

160
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:28,722
we would continue on a similar orbit 
as the preceding one

161
00:09:28,722 --> 00:09:31,369
and, of course,
we'll catch up to the target,

162
00:09:31,369 --> 00:09:33,919
but will come eventually in front of it.

163
00:09:33,919 --> 00:09:35,875
So we need to perform a maneuver

164
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:38,875
to increase the energy 
of the orbit of the chaser

165
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:41,180
so that we have now a perigee

166
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:43,918
such that the new <i>a</i> value

167
00:09:43,918 --> 00:09:46,854
of the last orbit 
of the chaser versus the target

168
00:09:46,854 --> 00:09:50,389
is such that <i>ΔX</i>,

169
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:53,029
performed in the last orbit,

170
00:09:53,029 --> 00:09:56,265
will be exactly equal to the distance

171
00:09:56,265 --> 00:09:59,165
between the <i>T_i</i> point and the target.

172
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,996
And we have approximate values

173
00:10:01,996 --> 00:10:06,486
that we determined earlier.

174
00:10:06,486 --> 00:10:08,596
If we want to have a certain <i>ΔX</i>,

175
00:10:08,596 --> 00:10:11,316
we need to have a certain <i>Δr</i>,

176
00:10:11,316 --> 00:10:14,881
or a certain difference
between the <i>r</i> and the <i>a</i>

177
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,976
of the elliptical orbit of the chaser

178
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:20,025
in order to perform the <i>ΔX</i>.

179
00:10:20,025 --> 00:10:23,134
So it's relatively easy 
to calculate the <i>ΔV</i>

180
00:10:23,134 --> 00:10:24,794
and necessary in order to,

181
00:10:24,794 --> 00:10:28,630
on the very last orbit,
have a catch-up of <i>ΔX</i>

182
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:32,140
exactly equal to the distance 
between <i>T_i</i> and target.
