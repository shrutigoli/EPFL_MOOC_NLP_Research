1
00:00:05,018 --> 00:00:08,581
Planet Earth is not a perfect sphere.
We all know that.

2
00:00:08,806 --> 00:00:13,132
In fact it has a very complex shape
but the major deviation from the

3
00:00:13,328 --> 00:00:18,403
sphere is the equatorial bulge.
It's somewhat of a flattened Earth

4
00:00:18,595 --> 00:00:21,595
because of the
rotation on itself.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,795
The difference between the
equatorial radius and

6
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:32,984
the polar radius is about 21 km
with a flattening of about 1 / 298.

7
00:00:33,402 --> 00:00:37,790
Now we have 2 consequences
because of that shape of the Earth;

8
00:00:38,015 --> 00:00:40,603
 the deviation from
the pure spherical shape.

9
00:00:40,796 --> 00:00:45,171
On one hand we have the so-called
nodal regression for orbits

10
00:00:45,391 --> 00:00:50,241
that have an inclination
more than zero and less than 90.

11
00:00:50,489 --> 00:00:53,489
Orbits that are basically to the
east, we're going to have a

12
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:57,206
nodal regression; the line of nodes
will be moving to the west

13
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,225
and for inclinations that are
larger than 90°, we have

14
00:01:02,953 --> 00:01:06,978
I would say, a nodal progression.
The line of node will be drifting

15
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:10,129
to the east. There's another
consequence that the rotation

16
00:01:10,338 --> 00:01:12,913
of the line of apsides
within the plane of the orbit.

17
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:14,893
We will not cover this
in this course.

18
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,919
We'll only cover the nodal
regression or nodal progression.

19
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:22,510
Nodal regression;
let's see what's going on.

20
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:25,901
We have here a representation 
of a flattened Earth.

21
00:01:26,137 --> 00:01:29,511
Of course a significant
exaggeration of the flattening

22
00:01:29,724 --> 00:01:34,549
but it's to better
understand what's going on.

23
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:39,258
We have here the
orbit of the spacecraft.

24
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:44,106
It goes in this direction.
Here we have the Earth equator here.

25
00:01:44,357 --> 00:01:47,357
We have here the
spacecraft itself.

26
00:01:47,846 --> 00:01:50,858
This is the center of the Earth
and from the center of the Earth

27
00:01:51,078 --> 00:01:55,303
we have the radius
vector r to the spacecraft.

28
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:59,121
Now what is interesting to see
is that in this situation we don't

29
00:01:59,351 --> 00:02:02,901
have a a central force
on the spacecraft directed to the

30
00:02:03,101 --> 00:02:06,025
center of the Earth but because of
the equatorial bulge

31
00:02:06,234 --> 00:02:11,147
we have a force on the spacecraft
which is somewhat tilted down.

32
00:02:11,513 --> 00:02:15,525
I put here f vectorial; the force
exercised  by the Earth

33
00:02:15,735 --> 00:02:18,823
with it's equatorial bulge
on the spacecraft

34
00:02:19,164 --> 00:02:24,164
and you see here that we have
a component of the force

35
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:30,167
I draw here f perpendicular
which is perpendicular to the

36
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:35,829
plane of the orbit and of course
this means that we have a torque

37
00:02:36,087 --> 00:02:43,775
equal to r cross f;
the cross product of r and f.

38
00:02:46,088 --> 00:02:49,763
We have a non-zero value of the
torque and as you know

39
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:52,963
this is the second law
of Newton for rotations.

40
00:02:53,197 --> 00:02:58,834
We have the torque equal to the
moment of inertia

41
00:02:59,054 --> 00:03:04,366
around the axis, delta times
d omega (ω) / dt.

42
00:03:04,593 --> 00:03:12,693
Omega being an angular rotation
velocity of the spacecraft on its orbit.

43
00:03:14,701 --> 00:03:19,338
If I represent here
the value of omega

44
00:03:19,843 --> 00:03:23,856
perpendicular to the orbital plane
then in this direction

45
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:27,929
because of the direction of the
motion of the satellite 

46
00:03:28,153 --> 00:03:32,753
around the Earth with an inclination
here which is less than 90°.

47
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:38,585
So if we do this cross product
of r cross f

48
00:03:38,915 --> 00:03:41,490
which will give us the direction
of dω / dt,

49
00:03:41,692 --> 00:03:46,692
we see that the dω / dt
is inside the sheet.

50
00:03:47,069 --> 00:03:50,156
Which means that this is the
ascending node.

51
00:03:50,369 --> 00:03:53,619
This is the point on the equator
that is crossed by the orbit

52
00:03:53,859 --> 00:03:56,947
going from south to north.
The ascending node is going to

53
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:01,965
drift because of that dω / dt,
to the west.

54
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:10,183
For inclination of less than 90°
and it's going to drift  to the east

55
00:04:10,609 --> 00:04:12,984
if we have the inclination
of more than 90°.

56
00:04:13,194 --> 00:04:17,543
If we represent here the
x-axis on our

57
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,620
inertial geocentric
reference system,

58
00:04:20,903 --> 00:04:24,628
we have the big omega (Ω)
and we see that

59
00:04:24,852 --> 00:04:31,552
dΩ, the right ascension 
of the ascending node over dt

60
00:04:31,749 --> 00:04:39,612
is going to be negative
for i less than 90°.

61
00:04:40,576 --> 00:04:45,288
dΩ right ascension of
the ascending node over dt

62
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:49,794
is going to be positive
for i more than 90°

63
00:04:50,037 --> 00:04:56,087
which means to the east in this case
and to the west in this case

64
00:04:56,278 --> 00:05:01,341
and dΩ/dt
is going to be equal to zero

65
00:05:01,552 --> 00:05:07,827
for i = 90°. So we have no
nodal regression at all

66
00:05:08,027 --> 00:05:12,027
if we have an inclination = 90°
or polar orbit.

67
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:16,226
By the way if we have an inclination
equal to zero degrees,

68
00:05:16,578 --> 00:05:18,390
if we have a purely
equatorial orbit

69
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:23,678
we also have no nodal regression
because we have no node at all.

70
00:05:23,893 --> 00:05:27,343
The node being the intersection of
the orbital plane with the equator

71
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:31,581
if both these 2 planes are together
obviously we have no intersection

72
00:05:31,795 --> 00:05:34,470
between the two.
So in summary

73
00:05:34,676 --> 00:05:40,051
we have nodal regression
dΩ / dt less than zero

74
00:05:40,265 --> 00:05:44,003
for inclination less than 90°.
We call it nodal regression.

75
00:05:44,225 --> 00:05:48,837
If we have inclination > 90, we talk
about nodal progression

76
00:05:49,038 --> 00:05:52,350
because it doesn't go the west.
It goes to the east.

77
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:56,383
We call it progression and we have
no regression or progression

78
00:05:56,602 --> 00:06:01,552
of the nodes for inclination 90°
for a purely polar orbit.

79
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:06,462
Now you can calculate the value of
dΩ over dt.

80
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:09,682
The drifts of the line of nodes
is a function of the

81
00:06:09,857 --> 00:06:13,231
inclination of the orbits;
the semi-major axis

82
00:06:13,426 --> 00:06:15,101
of the orbit
and the eccentricity.

83
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:19,660
Let's take for now eccentricity zero
so we only have circular orbits.

84
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:23,471
So obviously we have the inclination
that comes into play

85
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:26,031
and the
semi-major axis.

86
00:06:26,234 --> 00:06:30,821
With the power 3.5 the denominator,
obviously the larger the orbit

87
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:34,278
the less the nodal
progression or regression.

88
00:06:34,484 --> 00:06:37,433
That's obvious because if you
are very far away from the earth

89
00:06:37,616 --> 00:06:41,141
whether there's an equatorial bulge
or not it doesn't matter.

90
00:06:41,342 --> 00:06:45,117
It's just a point very far away
with a certain mass.

91
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,601
Now you have the influence
of the inclination

92
00:06:47,801 --> 00:06:52,275
with the cos sign of i
it means that the dΩ / dt

93
00:06:52,486 --> 00:06:56,849
will become smaller and smaller
as you go towards a polar orbit.

94
00:06:57,395 --> 00:07:00,832
Now we have a plot of the nodal
regression rates in degrees per day

95
00:07:01,063 --> 00:07:05,100
so it's dΩ / dt as a function
of the orbital inclination.

96
00:07:05,316 --> 00:07:09,641
So you basically have
the cos sign shape

97
00:07:09,993 --> 00:07:13,430
of that dΩ / dt
versus inclination.

98
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:18,101
You have the symmetry because
you have the cos sign of i.

99
00:07:19,017 --> 00:07:25,092
You have here the values of
inclination going from zero to 90°.

100
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:30,621
Then from 90° to 180° 
and obviously you have a symmetry.

101
00:07:30,931 --> 00:07:34,381
What is also here very clearly is
the influence of the altitude.

102
00:07:34,589 --> 00:07:40,651
The upper line is for a low orbit so
over 200 km above the Earth's surface;

103
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:44,229
The lower line for 5000.
Obviously the higher you are

104
00:07:44,451 --> 00:07:47,826
the less the nodal regression
for a given inclination.

105
00:07:48,026 --> 00:07:51,000
Now we have seen that we have
nodal regression for inclination

106
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:55,017
less than 90°
which mean that the dΩ / dt

107
00:07:55,226 --> 00:07:58,238
will be a negative
and you have a nodal progression

108
00:07:58,474 --> 00:08:02,836
with dΩ / dt positive
for inclination > 90°.

109
00:08:03,109 --> 00:08:08,358
Now we can use this nodal
progression for orbits

110
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:12,754
of a little > 90° inclination to
reach the so called

111
00:08:12,961 --> 00:08:15,224
Sun-synchronous
condition.

112
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:17,802
Sun-synchronous condition
means the following;

113
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:22,641
the orbit will keep the
same orientation versus the sun

114
00:08:22,852 --> 00:08:26,514
as the Earth is going around
the sun in a full year;

115
00:08:26,733 --> 00:08:29,421
a little more
than 365 days.

116
00:08:29,655 --> 00:08:32,067
Let's look at the
initial condition here.

117
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:36,139
Here we have an orbit which is
seen exactly edge-on;

118
00:08:36,413 --> 00:08:39,975
an orbit which has the sun
in it's plane

119
00:08:40,196 --> 00:08:43,159
and as the Earth is  going around
the sun in this direction

120
00:08:43,367 --> 00:08:47,405
counterclockwise, if we want
that orbit to always

121
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:50,300
keep the same orientation
versus the sun

122
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:54,264
it means that the line of node
will have to drift to the east,

123
00:08:54,469 --> 00:08:58,344
to the east with
about 1° per day.

124
00:08:58,612 --> 00:09:02,861
More precisely it has to be
0.9856° per day

125
00:09:03,061 --> 00:09:05,973
in order to keep that
Sun-synchronous condition.

126
00:09:06,189 --> 00:09:10,063
Now we have represented an orbit,
a peculiar orbit with the sun

127
00:09:10,263 --> 00:09:13,089
contained in the plane of the orbit.
Of course it can be for

128
00:09:13,309 --> 00:09:18,284
any other orbit. If we want this
orbit to keep the same orientation

129
00:09:18,487 --> 00:09:21,887
versus the sun as the Earth goes
around the sun in one year,

130
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:28,241
then we need to have the nodal
progression of about 1° per day

131
00:09:28,458 --> 00:09:30,571
or more precisely
the value indicated here.

132
00:09:30,756 --> 00:09:33,881
Now we have seen that in order to
have Sun-synchronous condition

133
00:09:34,049 --> 00:09:36,936
we need to have a certain
combination of the inclination

134
00:09:37,144 --> 00:09:42,057
and the distance. We of course
only consider circular orbits

135
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:47,515
so we are interested in the radius r
and the inclination.

136
00:09:47,736 --> 00:09:51,086
More precisely we have here a plot
of the orbital altitude

137
00:09:51,305 --> 00:09:53,981
above the Earth's surface
versus the inclination

138
00:09:54,205 --> 00:09:56,606
in order to have
Sun-synchronous conditions.

139
00:09:56,828 --> 00:10:00,928
And again, in order to have
a positive dΩ / dt

140
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:02,923
a drift of the line of node
to the east, 

141
00:10:03,149 --> 00:10:07,224
we need to have an orbit
a little more than 90° inclination.

142
00:10:07,502 --> 00:10:14,540
Typically it's between
95 and about 105° inclination

143
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:16,425
depending on
the altitude.
