00:00:05,672 --> 00:00:08,910
Hello everyone. Today we'll look
at catch up rates

2
00:00:09,455 --> 00:00:13,005
between nearby orbits and 
specifically, initially we look at

3
00:00:14,105 --> 00:00:16,530
2 co planar circular orbits.

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:19,243
There is the upper orbit here,

5
00:00:19,941 --> 00:00:21,941
and the lower orbit here.

6
00:00:22,184 --> 00:00:24,321
And they are close together

7
00:00:24,521 --> 00:00:27,521
which means that the delta R,
the difference between the radii

8
00:00:27,721 --> 00:00:30,246
of theses 2 orbits is small
compared to

9
00:00:30,984 --> 00:00:32,959
R, the radius of the upper orbit.

10
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:37,796
We have delta R, 
much smaller than R.

11
00:00:38,262 --> 00:00:41,487
And the question we ask ourselves
is after one full orbit,

12
00:00:41,687 --> 00:00:45,575
if we have these initial conditions
here with the 2 spacecrafts,

13
00:00:45,775 --> 00:00:49,337
the upper and the lower on the same
local vertical.

14
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,645
After one full orbit, what will
be the delta X?

15
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:57,670
How much forward will the lower
spacecraft move

16
00:00:58,374 --> 00:01:00,786
with respect to 
the upper spacecraft?

17
00:01:01,574 --> 00:01:04,424
We can represent the final
conditions here

18
00:01:04,945 --> 00:01:07,757
after one full orbit. 
And the question is

19
00:01:07,957 --> 00:01:11,607
delta X after one orbit

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,793
put a question mark.

21
00:01:14,296 --> 00:01:17,971
And again, we consider
close by orbits

22
00:01:18,171 --> 00:01:21,846
and we'll use these expressions 
a lot when we talk about

23
00:01:22,046 --> 00:01:24,696
the rendezvous in the near future.

24
00:01:24,978 --> 00:01:27,890
So let's start with the expression
for the period

25
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,378
this is the 3rd Kepler's law.

26
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:35,735
It's 2 pi times square root
of A cubed

27
00:01:36,621 --> 00:01:38,771
over mu.

28
00:01:39,613 --> 00:01:45,200
Or 2 pi, 1 over 
square root of mu.

29
00:01:45,963 --> 00:01:49,488
I can put here R to the 3 halfs. 

30
00:01:49,688 --> 00:01:51,850
A or R, the same here.

31
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:55,763
We have 2 circular orbits and semi
major axis or radius is the same.

32
00:01:56,431 --> 00:02:00,431
So we have the derivative
of T versus R

33
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:06,702
equals 3 pi

34
00:02:07,506 --> 00:02:10,669
times 1 over square root of mu

35
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:15,957
R to the one half.

36
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:22,467
Or 3 pi, square root of R

37
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:24,105
over mu,

38
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:25,771
which is in fact

39
00:02:26,486 --> 00:02:31,111
equal to 3 pi times the reciprocal
of the circle of velocity.

40
00:02:33,934 --> 00:02:35,934
Okay, we are nearly there now.

41
00:02:36,134 --> 00:02:38,897
We can multiply by 
the circular velocity.

42
00:02:39,097 --> 00:02:42,122
And we have V-circ

43
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:46,390
times delta T. We replace
the DT by delta T,

44
00:02:51,523 --> 00:02:53,961
is equal to delta X.

45
00:02:54,161 --> 00:02:57,011
In fact, that's what
we are looking for.

46
00:02:57,492 --> 00:03:01,592
And 3 pi times delta R.

47
00:03:03,950 --> 00:03:05,563
So this is an interesting result.

48
00:03:05,763 --> 00:03:07,900
We see that after one full orbit,

49
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,850
the lower spacecraft would have moved
forward of the upper spacecraft

50
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:16,446
by 3 pi times the difference
in altitude of the 2 orbits

51
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:18,321
or about 10 times.

52
00:03:18,965 --> 00:03:20,290
It's about 10.

53
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,913
And that's... interesting to know.

54
00:03:24,113 --> 00:03:27,475
Suppose you are with a chaser,

55
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:31,288
 it can be the space shuttle,
it can be a Soyuz,

56
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:35,250
on the same local vertical as the international 
space station at some point

57
00:03:36,583 --> 00:03:39,496
100 meters below 
after one full orbit

58
00:03:39,696 --> 00:03:41,708
should be 1 kilometer ahead.

59
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,258
And this is an important value
to keep in mind

60
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:48,458
for the rendezvous which
we'll handle later int he course.

61
00:03:49,873 --> 00:03:51,973
Now let's look at a somewhat
different situation

62
00:03:52,173 --> 00:03:55,660
where we have the lower spacecraft
not on a circular orbit

63
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:59,473
close to the circular orbit
of the upper object.

64
00:03:59,673 --> 00:04:03,135
But on elliptical orbit
with the A semi major axis

65
00:04:04,985 --> 00:04:06,360
relatively close to the value of R,

66
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,973
the radius of the circular orbit
of the upper body.

67
00:04:11,178 --> 00:04:12,278
So...

68
00:04:14,943 --> 00:04:17,731
We have the 2 spacecrafts

69
00:04:19,301 --> 00:04:21,251
initially together.

70
00:04:21,451 --> 00:04:24,801
And after one full orbit,

71
00:04:25,001 --> 00:04:29,563
we'll have the lower spacecraft 
on the elliptical orbit

72
00:04:30,629 --> 00:04:32,329
inside the circular orbit

73
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:37,279
of the upper body, and will have 
moved forward by a value of delta X.

74
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:40,391
So, we can write,

75
00:04:41,556 --> 00:04:44,556
outer orbit is circular

76
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:48,239
with a radius of R, 
and the inner orbit

77
00:04:48,914 --> 00:04:53,226
is elliptical with a semi
major axis...

78
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,928
A.

79
00:04:57,181 --> 00:05:00,056
With A less than R.

80
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:03,609
And we have these conditions
with R minus A,

81
00:05:03,809 --> 00:05:07,259
an absolute value 
much less than R.

82
00:05:09,371 --> 00:05:13,733
Now we have a situation which is 
quite similar to the previous one.

83
00:05:14,124 --> 00:05:18,024
You know the period is dependent
only on the semi major axis

84
00:05:18,625 --> 00:05:20,737
of an elliptical orbit.

85
00:05:20,937 --> 00:05:24,212
And whether the inner 
orbit is circular,

86
00:05:24,412 --> 00:05:26,925
or elliptical, doesn't
matter what counts.

87
00:05:27,137 --> 00:05:30,662
Is it a semi major axis? Or 
if it's circular, the value of R

88
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:34,000
which is the semi major axis
of a circular orbit.

89
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,912
So we have a similar expression
to what we had before

90
00:05:37,112 --> 00:05:39,762
with the delta X, 
after one full orbit.

91
00:05:40,435 --> 00:05:43,260
Equal to 3 pi times,

92
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,535
but this time instead of
delta R,

93
00:05:45,735 --> 00:05:47,947
we have R minus A.

94
00:05:51,896 --> 00:05:54,396
So this is a similar expression
to the one we had before

95
00:05:54,596 --> 00:05:56,996
but for the inner...

96
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:01,406
orbit, or the orbit of 
the lower body

97
00:06:01,606 --> 00:06:04,606


98
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,270
being elliptical 
instead of circular.

99
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:07,262
And we have a delta X,

100
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:09,913
positive,

101
00:06:11,563 --> 00:06:15,063
for the lower object

102
00:06:15,938 --> 00:06:18,663
with the A less than the value of R.

103
00:06:19,361 --> 00:06:22,836
So we have A less than R,

104
00:06:24,187 --> 00:06:27,187
and we have delta X negative,

105
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:31,570
for A more than R.

106
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:35,254
And that's like we had before. 
Obviously if you have 

107
00:06:36,589 --> 00:06:38,151
an elliptical orbit

108
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:41,887
larger than the circular orbit,
after one full orbit

109
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:45,275
the object on the elliptical orbit
will have been trailing behind

110
00:06:45,573 --> 00:06:49,160
if the elliptical orbit is smaller
than this object.

111
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:51,898
From this the elliptical orbit
will be leading forward

112
00:06:52,098 --> 00:06:55,985
of the circular orbit after
one full revolution.

113
00:06:58,017 --> 00:07:00,017
Here we summarize 
what we talked about before

114
00:07:00,217 --> 00:07:03,592
for 2 circular orbits after 
one full orbit, the delta X.

115
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:07,410
The difference in X of the 2 objects

116
00:07:07,610 --> 00:07:10,123
separated by a delta R 
much smaller than R

117
00:07:10,335 --> 00:07:13,573
will be about 10 times 
the difference in altitude.

118
00:07:13,962 --> 00:07:16,874
And for circular/ closed
elliptical orbit

119
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:19,242
it's going to be a factor 10 also

120
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:24,075
multiplied by the difference between
the radius of the circular orbit,

121
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:27,675
the semi major axis, 
of the elliptical orbit.

122
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:30,478
If the elliptical orbit is larger
than the circular orbit,

123
00:07:31,127 --> 00:07:34,227
this object on the elliptical orbit
will be trailing behind.

124
00:07:34,427 --> 00:07:36,639
If it is smaller, it will 
be leading forward

125
00:07:36,852 --> 00:07:38,239
after one full orbit.

126
00:07:39,944 --> 00:07:42,757
And here we offer you again
a summary of the situation.

127
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:45,157
Try to remember 
these expressions, they are

128
00:07:45,357 --> 00:07:47,232
really important 
for the rendezvous.

129
00:07:47,432 --> 00:07:49,944
2 circular orbits which are
very closed together,

130
00:07:50,144 --> 00:07:53,069
the lower object will be leading
forward after one full orbit

131
00:07:53,269 --> 00:07:55,494
by about 10 times 
the difference in altitude.

132
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,771
And for a circular versus
elliptical orbit,

133
00:07:58,971 --> 00:08:00,796
it's also a factor of 10

134
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:04,796
multiplied by the difference between
the radius of the circular orbit

135
00:08:04,996 --> 00:08:07,946
and the semi major axis
of the elliptical orbit.
