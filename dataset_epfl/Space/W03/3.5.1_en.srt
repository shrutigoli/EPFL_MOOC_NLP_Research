1
00:00:06,052 --> 00:00:08,695
On this picture you see
the International Space Station,

2
00:00:08,695 --> 00:00:13,028
picture taken in 2011,
when we still had the Space Shuttle,

3
00:00:13,028 --> 00:00:17,017
which you see here docked
to the forward portion

4
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:21,326
of the International Space Station,
or the US-OS segment.

5
00:00:21,326 --> 00:00:25,027
And in the back of the ISS
you have the ATV,

6
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:28,819
the Automatic Transfer Vehicle,
docked to the Russian segment.

7
00:00:29,196 --> 00:00:30,822
This part is the Russian segment,

8
00:00:30,822 --> 00:00:34,328
and you have either
a Progress or a Soyuz vehicle

9
00:00:34,328 --> 00:00:37,388
that are attached to ports
on the Russian segment.

10
00:00:38,107 --> 00:00:41,114
Now you see ATV attached in the back.

11
00:00:41,114 --> 00:00:42,594
This is a favorable position,

12
00:00:42,594 --> 00:00:46,969
because not only ATV
could bring resupply equipment,

13
00:00:46,969 --> 00:00:51,650
and fuel, and water,
and payloads and food for the crew,

14
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,338
but it also could reboost the Station,

15
00:00:55,798 --> 00:00:57,992
firing thrusters with the proper attitude,

16
00:00:57,992 --> 00:01:02,005
which was more the X-axis of the Station,
oriented horizontally.

17
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:05,316
You could reboost the Station
to the nominal altitude.

18
00:01:07,097 --> 00:01:10,104
Now these are all the ATV missions
that were flown,

19
00:01:10,542 --> 00:01:15,579
launch date was from 2008 until 2014,

20
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:18,042
for the five ATVs that were launched,

21
00:01:18,042 --> 00:01:21,965
each of them with the name
of either a scientist or a writer.

22
00:01:23,629 --> 00:01:26,841
The re-entry of ATV was destructive.

23
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:30,862
The crew was putting trash inside the ATV
after completion of the mission,

24
00:01:30,862 --> 00:01:33,509
which means after it had been emptied

25
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:35,658
of all the equipment
brought to the Station.

26
00:01:35,658 --> 00:01:39,717
After it had done, in many cases,
a reboost of the Station,

27
00:01:39,717 --> 00:01:42,187
it was filled with trash
and was de-docked,

28
00:01:42,187 --> 00:01:45,352
and then there was an automatic re-entry,

29
00:01:45,352 --> 00:01:48,271
but a destructive re-entry
in the atmosphere.

30
00:01:49,214 --> 00:01:51,849
Now this is a view of the ATV

31
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:55,034
as it is approaching the back
of the International Space Station,

32
00:01:55,034 --> 00:01:56,917
to the Russian segment.

33
00:01:56,917 --> 00:02:00,588
It was using various videometers,
and retroreflectors,

34
00:02:00,588 --> 00:02:03,147
and GPS navigation to do, again,

35
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:06,831
an entirely automatic approach
to the Station and docking.

36
00:02:07,265 --> 00:02:10,071
There was a possibility for the crew
on board the Station

37
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:14,725
to monitor the approach, and do an abort
of the approach of ATV if needed.

38
00:02:14,725 --> 00:02:18,630
It never happened - all the times
we had successful final approach

39
00:02:18,630 --> 00:02:20,941
and docking of ATV with the ISS.

40
00:02:21,442 --> 00:02:24,698
Here you see the inside of an ATV.

41
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:28,430
You have one compartment of ATV
which is accessible by the crew,

42
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,858
typically to get some food,
some equipment, some payloads.

43
00:02:32,858 --> 00:02:36,562
And the back of the ATV,
on the right-hand side,

44
00:02:36,562 --> 00:02:39,057
has tanks, water tanks.

45
00:02:39,057 --> 00:02:42,835
The oxygen is generated
on board the Station using water.

46
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:46,816
And also fuel, and thrusters.

47
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:52,134
The thrusters are not very visible,
but just here,

48
00:02:52,134 --> 00:02:53,561
the small thrusters that were used

49
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:57,019
in order to do the reboost
of the International Space Station.

50
00:02:57,019 --> 00:02:59,600
At the end of the mission of ATV
it was detached,

51
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,808
and prepared for destructive re-entry.

52
00:03:03,579 --> 00:03:06,378
Now, this is rendezvous profile
of ATV versus ISS.

53
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:08,486
It's pretty much like we saw
for the Shuttle.

54
00:03:08,486 --> 00:03:12,987
Basically, ATV was coming
from behind the Station,

55
00:03:12,987 --> 00:03:14,920
and below the Station.

56
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:17,163
At this point here
we had a circular orbit -

57
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:19,611
circular orbit means a straight line -

58
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:23,660
and of course the motion
was from the right to the left here,

59
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:26,504
because the velocity vector
of the station,

60
00:03:26,504 --> 00:03:30,625
which is here, is to the left,

61
00:03:31,365 --> 00:03:35,114
and the idea is to get to S_2
after a certain time.

62
00:03:35,114 --> 00:03:36,966
And the timing was also arranged

63
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:40,835
so that ATV would arrive
at the Station in daylight,

64
00:03:40,835 --> 00:03:45,956
for better visibility of the crew
to the approaching re-supply vehicle.

65
00:03:46,714 --> 00:03:51,253
On this point you see that the orbit
has been changed to an elliptical orbit.

66
00:03:51,253 --> 00:03:53,103
This is the perigee
of the elliptical orbit,

67
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:54,986
and it gets to this point here,

68
00:03:54,986 --> 00:04:00,420
where, again, the orbit of ATV
is going to be made circular,

69
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,505
that's why we have a straight line

70
00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:04,498
parallel to the surface of the Earth,

71
00:04:04,498 --> 00:04:07,761
because we know the X-axis,
which is straight here,

72
00:04:07,761 --> 00:04:12,014
is in fact a curved line which is parallel
to the surface of the Earth.

73
00:04:12,456 --> 00:04:17,053
On S_1 we transform our orbit again
into an elliptical orbit,

74
00:04:17,053 --> 00:04:22,771
which will have the apogee in S_2
and then we look at the next slide

75
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:26,410
to see the final approach
of ATV to the ISS.

76
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:30,005
Here we have S_2 and again,

77
00:04:30,005 --> 00:04:33,826
pretty much like the final approach
of the Shuttle to the ISS,

78
00:04:33,826 --> 00:04:37,514
when we reach S_2
which is at the same altitude

79
00:04:37,514 --> 00:04:40,504
as the Station but it's behind it.

80
00:04:40,504 --> 00:04:44,772
As we come from an elliptical orbit
which has a smaller, semi-major axis

81
00:04:44,772 --> 00:04:49,231
than the radius of the circular orbit
of the target, which is the Station,

82
00:04:49,231 --> 00:04:52,364
we have a relative velocity 
towards the right.

83
00:04:52,364 --> 00:04:56,316
We are slower than
the International Space Station.

84
00:04:56,755 --> 00:05:01,417
At this point we need
to give a posigrade burn;

85
00:05:01,417 --> 00:05:05,656
again, it was done automatically
in order to raise the perigee

86
00:05:05,656 --> 00:05:08,061
to this altitude here,

87
00:05:08,061 --> 00:05:12,459
so that we have the <i>Î”X</i>, here
corresponding to what we want,

88
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:15,353
so that eventually we will get to S_3

89
00:05:15,353 --> 00:05:19,154
which is 250 meters behind
the International Space Station.

90
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:22,570
And the last part
of the automatic approach to Station

91
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:25,575
was done horizontally,
using these various sensors,

92
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:27,693
videometers, and retroreflectors.
