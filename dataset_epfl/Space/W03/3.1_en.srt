Hello everyone, and welcome to Unit 3:

2
00:00:08,551 --> 00:00:11,737
Orbital maneuvers,
special orbits and rendezvous.

3
00:00:11,737 --> 00:00:15,434
By the way, we have
a great picture of the Space Shuttle

4
00:00:15,434 --> 00:00:18,176
slowly approaching
the International Space Station

5
00:00:18,176 --> 00:00:20,960
prior to docking
to the orbiter complex.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,499
It's really a nice picture because
this view, shortly after sunset,

7
00:00:25,499 --> 00:00:30,374
lasts only a very short time
because it's day for about one hour,

8
00:00:30,374 --> 00:00:34,000
then we have sunset,
which takes about 20 seconds,

9
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,677
and then it's pretty dark,
so the crew was good

10
00:00:36,677 --> 00:00:39,675
in taking this picture
just at the right time.

11
00:00:39,897 --> 00:00:44,022
It's a really beautiful view:
shuttle approaching ISS.

12
00:00:45,242 --> 00:00:49,522
Now we'll talk this week
about 3.2 orbital maneuvers,

13
00:00:49,522 --> 00:00:54,058
3.3 is special orbits,
3.4 rendezvous,

14
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:58,821
and 3.5 will be the case
of the Automatic Transfer Vehicle or ATV.

15
00:00:59,858 --> 00:01:03,099
We have prepared
some practice quizzes after each video

16
00:01:03,099 --> 00:01:07,176
to make sure that you understand
the concepts explained in these videos.

17
00:01:08,172 --> 00:01:14,547
Each section from 3.2 to 3.5
is concluded with a control quiz.

18
00:01:15,131 --> 00:01:17,961
In addition, there will be
a test at the end of the unit.

19
00:01:18,894 --> 00:01:23,235
To illustrate the unit,
we have prepared a focus on Cheops,

20
00:01:24,019 --> 00:01:26,499
the Cheops Mission with the interview

21
00:01:26,499 --> 00:01:28,975
of Willy Benz,
the principal investigator.

22
00:01:29,868 --> 00:01:34,435
Looking at this is not compulsory,
but we encourage you to do it

23
00:01:34,435 --> 00:01:37,717
in order to deepen your knowledge
about this particular subject.

24
00:01:37,717 --> 00:01:39,067
Have fun!
