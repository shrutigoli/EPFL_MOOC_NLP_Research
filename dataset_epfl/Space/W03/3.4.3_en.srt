00:00:05,724 --> 00:00:07,818
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:11,918
Today we'll talk about rendezvous
and rendezvous phases.

3
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:16,420
Basically, the rendezvous is the action
of bringing together two spacecraft,

4
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:20,714
and most of the time what we have
is a spacecraft on the ground,

5
00:00:20,714 --> 00:00:22,880
and we name it the chaser.

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,953
And the other spacecraft is on orbit,
the target, and we abbreviate it

7
00:00:28,953 --> 00:00:33,234
we with TGT, and the action
of the rendezvous is to bring together

8
00:00:33,234 --> 00:00:34,943
the chaser with the target.

9
00:00:35,141 --> 00:00:38,627
Most of the time, 
we have the target being passive

10
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:40,335
and the chaser is active.

11
00:00:40,335 --> 00:00:42,811
The target is also on a circular orbit.

12
00:00:42,811 --> 00:00:46,291
We'll only consider cases
where the target is on circular orbit

13
00:00:46,291 --> 00:00:47,704
with eccentricity zero.

14
00:00:48,405 --> 00:00:52,362
Now what you see here is the Earth
with the Earth equator here.

15
00:00:52,362 --> 00:00:57,876
We have the chaser on the launchpad,
typically Kennedy Space Center, Florida,

16
00:00:57,876 --> 00:01:01,724
28.5 degrees northern latitude,

17
00:01:01,818 --> 00:01:04,941
or it can be Baikonur for Soyuz.

18
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:07,450
And we have the target on orbit.

19
00:01:07,450 --> 00:01:10,160
We have the inclination
of the orbit here which is larger

20
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:13,631
than the latitude of the launch site
for the chaser,

21
00:01:13,631 --> 00:01:15,791
which is one of the conditions.

22
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:19,744
You cannot go to, for instance,
the equatorial orbit.

23
00:01:19,744 --> 00:01:24,771
Target on the equatorial orbit
launching from a launch site,

24
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:27,369
which has a latitude
different from zero degrees.

25
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:30,781
We need to have inclination
of the orbit of the target larger

26
00:01:30,781 --> 00:01:33,455
than the latitude of the launch site.

27
00:01:33,455 --> 00:01:35,318
So these are the initial conditions.

28
00:01:35,318 --> 00:01:40,732
The final conditions are chaser and target
at the same location in space

29
00:01:40,732 --> 00:01:44,493
with the same vectorial velocity.

30
00:01:44,493 --> 00:01:48,920
Then, after the rendezvous completes,
you have either a docking of the chaser

31
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:51,546
with the target 
which is the case for Soyuz

32
00:01:51,546 --> 00:01:54,287
and the International Space Station, 
for instance.

33
00:01:54,287 --> 00:01:56,571
Or you have a grapple 
with the robot arm

34
00:01:56,571 --> 00:01:58,985
which was the case 
when we had the rendezvous

35
00:01:58,985 --> 00:02:01,970
between the Shuttle 
and the Hubble Space Telescope.

36
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:03,783
We'll talk about that later.

37
00:02:04,426 --> 00:02:05,711
Well, here we are.

38
00:02:05,711 --> 00:02:09,961
We lifted off with a chaser,
and one of the important conditions

39
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:13,242
is we have to come 
with the chaser on an orbit

40
00:02:13,242 --> 00:02:15,919
which is co-planar
with the plane of the orbit

41
00:02:15,919 --> 00:02:17,226
of the target,

42
00:02:17,226 --> 00:02:20,152
or nearly co-planar
because we'll come initially

43
00:02:20,152 --> 00:02:23,608
to a lower orbit 
and normally behind the target.

44
00:02:23,608 --> 00:02:27,563
And, of course, it would be somewhat
of a differential nodal regression

45
00:02:27,563 --> 00:02:29,552
because of the difference in altitude

46
00:02:29,673 --> 00:02:32,190
of our two orbits, 
the chaser and the target.

47
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:35,457
So it's not exactly in the plane 
of the orbit of the target,

48
00:02:35,457 --> 00:02:39,678
but we lift off at such a time,
and we commit to an orbit

49
00:02:39,678 --> 00:02:41,763
such that when we complete
the rendezvous,

50
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:44,949
we'll be in exactly the same plane
or pretty exactly in the same plane.

51
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:49,428
We saw before that any plane change
is very expensive in propellant

52
00:02:49,428 --> 00:02:54,275
so you try to minimize 
these plane changes for the chaser

53
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,381
when you get close to the target.

54
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,987
Now here you are,
on your orbit with the chaser.

55
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:02,588
Initially, you are pretty far away
from the target

56
00:03:02,588 --> 00:03:05,008
so you count on the ground.

57
00:03:05,008 --> 00:03:09,177
You expect the ground to provide you
with the maneuvers to be performed

58
00:03:09,177 --> 00:03:14,373
in order to complete the rendezvous
within typically 48 hours.

59
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:18,689
That was the case for the Shuttle
and Soyuz also in the past.

60
00:03:18,689 --> 00:03:22,095
Right now we can perform
this rendezvous much quicker

61
00:03:22,095 --> 00:03:25,601
in about 6 hours because 
of the much better accuracy we have

62
00:03:25,601 --> 00:03:28,673
with the determination 
of the orbit using GPS,

63
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:30,210
which we didn't have before.

64
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,751
So initially, we have a ground-targeted 
rendezvous process,

65
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,850
and when we get close enough,
we can use sensors inside the chaser,

66
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,609
typically for the Shuttle

67
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:42,123
it was star tracker.

68
00:03:42,123 --> 00:03:43,731
And also the rendezvous radar.

69
00:03:43,731 --> 00:03:47,503
Star tracker was giving us
the azimuth and elevation

70
00:03:47,503 --> 00:03:52,181
of the target versus the chaser,
and the rendezvous radar

71
00:03:52,181 --> 00:03:57,904
is providing azimuth and elevation
and range and range rate.

72
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:01,575
The distance in feet
and the range rate in feet per second.

73
00:04:01,575 --> 00:04:05,330
And all this data incorporated 
into the relative state vector

74
00:04:05,330 --> 00:04:08,073
of the target versus the chaser.

75
00:04:08,073 --> 00:04:11,710
And this is used in order to know 
exactly or pretty exactly

76
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:14,306
where the target is 
versus the chaser.

77
00:04:14,306 --> 00:04:19,143
And at the end of the rendezvous,
we do onboard targeted process

78
00:04:19,143 --> 00:04:20,902
where we use all this data

79
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:23,811
to perform precisely the end
of the rendezvous.

80
00:04:23,811 --> 00:04:26,864
Now it's really a matter
of relative state vector.

81
00:04:26,864 --> 00:04:32,797
The state vector 
of the chaser is <i>X dot, Y dot, Z dot</i>

82
00:04:32,797 --> 00:04:37,522
Same for the target, <i>X dot, Y dot, Z dot</i>

83
00:04:37,522 --> 00:04:40,871
The difference between the two
gives you the position of the target

84
00:04:40,871 --> 00:04:44,638
versus the chaser,
its distance and its range rate.

85
00:04:44,638 --> 00:04:48,953
Toward the end of the rendezvous,
we have here the Space Shuttle

86
00:04:48,953 --> 00:04:53,644
making a rendezvous 
with one of the early configurations

87
00:04:53,644 --> 00:04:57,023
of the International Space Station,
where we had only two elements.

88
00:04:57,023 --> 00:05:01,272
We have on the far right side,
the Zarya module,

89
00:05:01,272 --> 00:05:03,210
which is the first Russian module.

90
00:05:03,210 --> 00:05:07,550
Then we have the first Node,
American Node or the Unity Node

91
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:09,288
that is attached to it.

92
00:05:09,288 --> 00:05:12,829
And the proximity operation
is the final portion of the rendezvous,

93
00:05:13,050 --> 00:05:16,458
where the Space Shuttle,
it can be Soyuz also,

94
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:21,354
determined the range,
the range rate, RDOT,

95
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:24,230
means range rate in ft/s.

96
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:26,424
Then the LOS is for line of sight.

97
00:05:26,424 --> 00:05:29,511
It's really azimuth and elevation
with respect to a frame

98
00:05:29,511 --> 00:05:31,676
attached to the Shuttle itself.

99
00:05:31,676 --> 00:05:34,159
And when get to PROX OPS,
at least with the Shuttle

100
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:37,909
it was all manually operated
flying of the Space Shuttle

101
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:43,614
to come very close to the target
for a docking with the ISS

102
00:05:43,614 --> 00:05:46,900
or for grapple 
with the Hubble Space Telescope,

103
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,920
but these operations were
all manual, performed normally

104
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:52,197
by the commander 
in the case of the Shuttle.

105
00:05:52,197 --> 00:05:54,534
That's still automatic 
with a Soyuz spacecraft

106
00:05:54,534 --> 00:05:56,670
with a manual backup if needed.

107
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:59,559
Now this is the final approach,
and we have two examples here

108
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:02,702
with the Space Shuttle approaching
the Hubble Space Telescope,

109
00:06:02,702 --> 00:06:08,997
and you see in the upper drawing,
the robot arm of the Space Shuttle

110
00:06:08,997 --> 00:06:12,693
that has been deployed already
because the end of the rendezvous

111
00:06:12,693 --> 00:06:15,816
with the Hubble Space Telescope
was with the grapple

112
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:18,894
of the telescope
but insulation of the payload bay.

113
00:06:18,894 --> 00:06:22,320
In the bottom, you see 
the approach of Shuttle

114
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,507
to the International Space Station.

115
00:06:24,507 --> 00:06:28,020
It just happens that Hubble
was inertially stabilized.

116
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:32,111
Its orientation was always 
kept the same

117
00:06:32,111 --> 00:06:36,412
with respect to the inertial frame,
so we had to match the orientation

118
00:06:36,412 --> 00:06:40,607
of the Shuttle to the orientation
of the Hubble Space Telescope.

119
00:06:40,607 --> 00:06:43,499
So we went to inertial hold
for the Space Shuttle.

120
00:06:43,499 --> 00:06:47,838
Basically, flying the Space Shuttle
is a 6 degree freedom operation,

121
00:06:47,859 --> 00:06:51,758
You have 3 degrees of freedom rotation,
pitch, yaw, and roll,

122
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:55,753
and 3 degrees of freedom 
translation, up, down, left, right

123
00:06:55,753 --> 00:06:57,237
and forward, aft.

124
00:06:57,395 --> 00:07:01,635
And what we did with the Space Shuttle
for any rendezvous

125
00:07:01,635 --> 00:07:04,886
whether with Hubble
or with International Space Station

126
00:07:04,886 --> 00:07:09,263
was to have the digital autopilot
which is a capability in the Shuttle

127
00:07:09,263 --> 00:07:12,742
to take care of all the rotations,
and the translations

128
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:15,913
were performed manually by the commander.

129
00:07:15,913 --> 00:07:19,712
So, again, inertial hold for an approach 
to the Hubble Space Telescope

130
00:07:19,712 --> 00:07:23,166
because it was
or it still is inertially stabilized.

131
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:25,861
However, 
with the International Space Station,

132
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:31,537
which always keeps the same orientation
with respect to the Earth reference

133
00:07:31,537 --> 00:07:35,981
below the station, typically 
keeps the same circle LVLH,

134
00:07:36,077 --> 00:07:38,610
local vertical, local horizontal attitude.

135
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:44,063
Then we had to ask the digital autopilot
or command the digital autopilot

136
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:47,449
of the shuttle
to be also LVLH stabilized.

137
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:51,438
And then again, the commander
or the pilot was performing the rendezvous

138
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:54,113
commanding only the translations
and not the rotations.

139
00:07:55,345 --> 00:07:57,806
Now we have some pictures
illustrating all of this.

140
00:07:57,806 --> 00:08:00,596
This is a view of the payload bay 
of the Space Shuttle,

141
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:04,653
a scene from one of the windows
in the aft part of the cockpit

142
00:08:04,653 --> 00:08:06,135
of the spaceship.

143
00:08:06,135 --> 00:08:09,070
And you see the payload bay;
you see the two parts in the back

144
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:12,601
containing propellants 
for attitude control and part

145
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:14,528
of the vertical tail also.

146
00:08:14,528 --> 00:08:19,650
And in the foreground, you see
the docking interface of the Shuttle

147
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:21,749
with the International Space Station.

148
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:26,182
You see the three petals,
and on the other side, on the ISS side,

149
00:08:26,182 --> 00:08:29,342
you also have 
a similar congregation of three petals

150
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:31,951
which were just merging each other

151
00:08:31,951 --> 00:08:36,128
as the Shuttle was approaching 
and mating with ISS.

152
00:08:36,452 --> 00:08:41,139
Here you have the Space Shuttle
that has docked with ISS.

153
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:45,432
So the docking interface was relatively 
close to the aft part of the cockpit

154
00:08:45,432 --> 00:08:50,078
so it gave the crew good visibility 
to this final and very critical phase

155
00:08:50,078 --> 00:08:53,985
of the rendezvous, and approach,
and final docking.

156
00:08:54,814 --> 00:08:59,269
You see also on this picture,
the robot arm of the Space Shuttle

157
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:01,926
deployed on the righthand side,

158
00:09:01,926 --> 00:09:05,470
and you see the robot arm of the Station
which is on the left side of the picture.

159
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:11,102
Now in case of rendezvous 
of the Space Shuttle

160
00:09:11,102 --> 00:09:13,782
with the Hubble Space Telescope
as mentioned,

161
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,963
you didn't have docking,

162
00:09:15,963 --> 00:09:22,115
but you had a grapple of the telescope
with the remote manipulator system

163
00:09:22,115 --> 00:09:24,556
of the Shuttle or the robot arm
of the Shuttle

164
00:09:24,556 --> 00:09:28,021
which was manually commanded
by one of the mission specialists.

165
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:30,692
Now, the Shuttle always had
to come in close proximity

166
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:35,836
with a well-planned relative position
of the spacecraft

167
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:40,732
with the Hubble Space Telescope
in order to make the grapple

168
00:09:40,732 --> 00:09:45,591
relatively easy on one hand
and also far away from obstacles

169
00:09:45,591 --> 00:09:51,289
like the antennas of the telescope
or the solar arrays of the instruments.

170
00:09:51,289 --> 00:09:54,192
So it was a relatively difficult task.

171
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:57,826
It had to be performed very precisely,
but it was trained a lot

172
00:09:57,826 --> 00:10:02,021
in the simulator and was always successful
for all the servicing missions of Hubble.

173
00:10:02,152 --> 00:10:04,699
There were five total until 2009.

174
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:10,524
Now, you have another example
of end of the rendezvous and grapple,

175
00:10:10,524 --> 00:10:15,650
and this time, it's a view from 
the International Space Station of HTV,

176
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:20,454
which is a Japanese resupply vehicle
of the station

177
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,603
which has just been grappled

178
00:10:22,603 --> 00:10:26,074
with the Space Station 
robotic manipulator system

179
00:10:26,074 --> 00:10:29,217
commanded by the crew
normally from the cupola

180
00:10:29,217 --> 00:10:31,244
of the International Space Station.

181
00:10:31,244 --> 00:10:35,509
You just had the grapple performed,
and then using the same robot arm,

182
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:39,456
the resupply vehicle is going
to be brought through a mating position

183
00:10:39,456 --> 00:10:43,670
of the station for the crew to be able
to get the content of the vehicle.
