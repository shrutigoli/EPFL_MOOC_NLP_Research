Geosynchronous and geostationary orbits, these are very important orbits, especially the geostationary, for communication satellites.
We do the following: we determine the value of <i>r</i>, the distance of the satellite to the center of the Earth, which will give us <i>T</i>, a period equal to a sidereal day, which is 23 hours and 56 minutes.
If we have this condition, the satellite will rotate around the Earth at the same pace as the Earth rotates around itself, and if we have an orbit which is on the Equator, on one hand, and perfectly circular, you can imagine that the satellite will always remain at the same point in the sky, so this is ideal for communication, typically between one continent to the other.
If you look at the picture on the left-hand side, this is a satellite on geostationary orbits.
It will give us a distance to the center of the Earth if we do this calculation here, for <i>T</i> = 23 h 56 min, of 42,164.2 km, or about 36,000 km above the Earth's surface.
It's important, if you want to have a geostationary orbit, to have a perfectly circular orbit, in order not to have a swing of the satellite in longitude which would, of course, have a negative effect on the communication between one place of the Earth to the other one, because the antennas pointing to the satellite will miss the satellite every now and then, if you have this swing, and it's important, also, to have inclination zero, because if you have any inclination other than zero the satellite will swing North and then South, with the same period of 23 h 56 min.
You want to have circular orbit, and on the Equator, in order to have perfect geostationary orbit.
Now, how to get to the geostationary orbit.
You launch your satellite from launch site at a certain latitude, which is normally not zero, because there are no launch sites on the Equator, and you come, initially, on a parking orbit which is not on the Equator, but because you want to reach the Equator, finally, on your final geostationary orbit, you will need to do the transfer to the geostationary orbit when you are crossing the Equator.
Here you have the line of nodes, the intersection between the plane of your orbit and the Equator.
And the idea is to do, basically, a Hohmann transfer from that point here until the apogee, here.
The apogee has to be at the geostationary altitude,
36,000 km above the Earth's surface.
Now, that geostationary transfer orbit is not on the Equator, it has a certain inclination versus the Equator which, in fact, is equal to the latitude of the launch site, if you do the most efficient launch from any launch site.
Typically, it's going to be about seven degrees for a launch from French Guiana, in Kourou, the European launch site.
It's going to be 28.5 degrees if the launch takes place from Kennedy Space Center, Florida, because the latitude of Kennedy
Space Center is 28.5 degrees.
Now, imagine the geostationary transfer orbit has the apogee at this point, it crosses again the Equator.
Obviously, the <i>V_apogee</i> is not equal to the circular orbit at that altitude.
You will have to do a <i>Î”V_2</i> for circularization but you also will have to apply another <i>vectorial Î”V</i> in order to do a plane change, to change the plane of the orbit from the initial plane to the Equatorial condition.
So, you arrive at the apogee,
<i>Î”V_2</i> and <i>Î”V_1</i> or you could do a combination of the two, which we'll see later.
You arrive at the apogee of your geostationary transfer orbit, at this point, with a velocity of about 1.6 km/s, if you departed from a parking orbit, low altitude above the Earth's surface.
So that's where you are, and where you want to be is really here, in terms of velocity.
You want to have a circular velocity of about 3 km/s in order to stay geostationary on that high orbit, high circular orbit, at 36,000 km above the Earth's surface.
In order to get there, there are two options.
Either you can do, first, a plane change, come to this point, and then the acceleration to the circular condition at that orbit. so you would have a <i>Î”V_3</i> first, which is about 0.79 km/s, followed by an acceleration of 1.4 km/s in order to get there.
It's much better, however, to combine these two maneuvers of plane change and acceleration, to the circular condition with the <i>Î”V_Combined</i>, which is about 1.8 km/s, which is less than the sum of <i>Î”V_3</i> and <i>Î”V_2</i>.
Visibility of the Earth's surface from the geostationary orbit.
You have the example of the Inmarsat set of satellites.
You basically have three satellites.
You have one over the Atlantic Ocean, one over the Indian Ocean, one over the Pacific Ocean, which will give you a complete coverage.
These areas - pale blue on the left, pale green in the middle, and dark blue on the right - are the areas of coverage of these three satellites, and you see you have a complete coverage over the whole surface of the Earth, except the Polar regions.
This is another subject: ground track.
This is a ground track of a satellite, in fact it's HST, the Hubble Space Telescope, which is on a 28.5 degrees inclination orbit.
And you see the orbit where HST is at this point, and you see the previous orbit, which is somewhat to the east, and the next orbit, which is somewhat to the west of the current orbit.
Due to the fact that Earth is rotating around itself at 15 degrees per hour, and the period of revolution on a low-Earth orbit is typically 90 minutes, it means that from one equatorial crossing, like this one, this is on this current orbit, equatorial crossing, to the next one, you have 1.5 times 15 degrees, so that's going to give you 22.5 degrees.
So each equatorial crossing is further to the west by 22.5 degrees.
This is for low Earth orbits, so with a period of about
90 minutes around the Earth.
Obviously, if you have satellites on geostationary orbits, the ground track is just one point.
If you have a satellite over the Atlantic, at this location, that's a ground track.
The ground track represented here, we have the example of HST is for low Earth orbit.
