1
00:00:05,835 --> 00:00:08,121
The restricted three-body problem,

2
00:00:08,164 --> 00:00:13,479
the general three-body problem is complex
and we will not cover this in this course.

3
00:00:13,479 --> 00:00:18,606
The restricted three-body problem
is the following:

4
00:00:18,606 --> 00:00:21,683
we have two relatively large bodies

5
00:00:21,683 --> 00:00:24,254
it can be for instance the Earth 
and the Moon

6
00:00:24,305 --> 00:00:28,805
or it can be the Sun and the Earth,
ignoring all the other planets.

7
00:00:28,805 --> 00:00:31,629
And we have another body
which is a spacecraft

8
00:00:31,629 --> 00:00:34,886
which is the black dot in this drawing.

9
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:39,161
We have a certain number of conditions,
the two main bodies on the circular orbit

10
00:00:39,161 --> 00:00:41,421
around the center of mass 
of the system.

11
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:44,397
We don't need to have or mind 
these two large bodies,

12
00:00:44,397 --> 00:00:48,160
one being much smaller or less massive
than the other one.

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,870
Typically, in the case of the Earth 
and the Moon,

14
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:54,306
the Moon is a relatively massive object
compared to the Earth,

15
00:00:54,306 --> 00:00:57,529
less mass obviously 
but it's not infinitely small

16
00:00:57,529 --> 00:00:59,661
compared to the mass of the Earth.

17
00:00:59,661 --> 00:01:02,957
Now for the third body, 
the black dot in this drawing,

18
00:01:02,957 --> 00:01:07,128
typically a satellite or a spacecraft,
its mass has to be much smaller

19
00:01:07,128 --> 00:01:09,413
than the mass of the other two bodies.

20
00:01:09,413 --> 00:01:14,370
And we consider the motion 
of this small body

21
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:17,463
in the plane of the orbit
of the two main bodies.

22
00:01:17,463 --> 00:01:20,126
Now it just happened 
that we have a certain number of positions

23
00:01:20,126 --> 00:01:24,898
called the <i>Lagrange</i> points
where the small body, the black dot,

24
00:01:24,898 --> 00:01:28,805
keeps the same position 
with respect to the other two bodies

25
00:01:28,805 --> 00:01:31,737
as the two bodies are revolving around
each other.

26
00:01:31,737 --> 00:01:34,465
There are five such points,
five Lagrange points.

27
00:01:34,621 --> 00:01:39,661
Now let's consider the case of the Sun
and the Earth,

28
00:01:39,661 --> 00:01:42,692
and let's look at the position 
of the so-called Lagrange points

29
00:01:42,692 --> 00:01:45,026
in the Sun-Earth system.

30
00:01:45,026 --> 00:01:48,530
We have five such Lagrange point.

31
00:01:48,530 --> 00:01:52,826
We have L1 which is located 
between the Earth and the Sun,

32
00:01:52,826 --> 00:01:56,613
and the distance to the Earth
of the L1 Lagrange point

33
00:01:56,613 --> 00:01:58,559
is about 1.5 million kilometers.

34
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:03,066
So it's 100th of an astronomical unit,
or 100th of the distance

35
00:02:03,111 --> 00:02:04,915
between the Earth and the Sun.

36
00:02:04,915 --> 00:02:07,711
We have the Lagrange point L2

37
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:10,981
which is just on the other side 
of the Earth versus the Sun,

38
00:02:10,981 --> 00:02:15,960
1.5 million km away from the Earth
in the anti-Sun direction.

39
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:20,385
We have L3 which is a little bit further
than the orbit of the Earth,

40
00:02:20,385 --> 00:02:23,416
still on the line between the Sun
and the Earth.

41
00:02:23,416 --> 00:02:27,057
And we have L4 and L5,

42
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:32,800
which in fact
are on an equilateral triangle

43
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:35,703
between the Earth and the Sun,

44
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:39,662
and L4 is similar to L5.

45
00:02:39,662 --> 00:02:45,189
Now it just happens that for these points
we have the sum of the gravitational forces

46
00:02:45,189 --> 00:02:47,091
of the Sun and the Earth,

47
00:02:47,091 --> 00:02:52,185
and the inertial forces 
on the circular orbits on these points,

48
00:02:52,185 --> 00:02:54,025
balancing themselves.

49
00:02:54,131 --> 00:02:59,895
You can imagine on L1 that it is 
as if you had the satellite

50
00:02:59,895 --> 00:03:02,662
or the spacecraft at this location

51
00:03:02,662 --> 00:03:06,332
on gravitational orbits around the Sun

52
00:03:06,332 --> 00:03:09,140
but with somewhat less mass of the Sun

53
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,498
because we have the Earth attracting 
in the other direction.

54
00:03:12,217 --> 00:03:18,590
Remember that the period is equal 
to <i>2π √ a³ / µ</i>.

55
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:20,549
This is the third Kepler's Law.

56
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:25,488
So if you imagine that for L1 
revolving around the Sun,

57
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:28,410
it is as if the mass of the Sun 
was somewhat diminished

58
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,249
because you have the Earth behind,

59
00:03:30,298 --> 00:03:33,716
and so the <i>µ</i> is somewhat decreasing
the denominator

60
00:03:33,861 --> 00:03:36,347
and then the square root 
for the third Kepler Law,

61
00:03:36,347 --> 00:03:39,618
so you have a value of <i>a³</i>

62
00:03:39,618 --> 00:03:42,454
and the numerator 
that is somewhat diminished also.

63
00:03:42,454 --> 00:03:47,949
Now for L2, you have, to a certain degree
the mass of the Sun,

64
00:03:47,949 --> 00:03:51,373
which is somewhat increased
by the Earth situated in between

65
00:03:51,373 --> 00:03:55,217
so it's as if you had 
a somewhat larger mass of the Sun.

66
00:03:55,217 --> 00:03:59,825
So you go around the Sun on a value of <i>a</i>
which is a little bit larger

67
00:03:59,825 --> 00:04:02,514
according to the third Kepler's Law.

68
00:04:02,514 --> 00:04:07,464
For L3, a point on L3 of course

69
00:04:07,464 --> 00:04:10,504
is subject to the gravitational field 
of the Sun,

70
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:12,525
but you have the Earth on the other side

71
00:04:12,525 --> 00:04:15,558
which is as if the Sun 
had a somewhat larger mass.

72
00:04:15,558 --> 00:04:18,430
So L3 somewhat beyond the Earth orbit

73
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:21,769
on the opposite direction of the Earth
versus the Sun.

74
00:04:21,769 --> 00:04:24,818
It's really more complex
to look at L4 and L5

75
00:04:24,818 --> 00:04:26,850
but these are so-called <i>stable points</i>.

76
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:33,049
You have hollow potential,
a set of potential lines here

77
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:35,766
so that you have stability of L4 and L5.

78
00:04:36,404 --> 00:04:41,835
For L1, L2, and L3, you have stability
across the plane.

79
00:04:41,835 --> 00:04:44,446
The red arrows indicate the stability.

80
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:49,075
If you go a little bit away from the line
between the Earth and the Sun,

81
00:04:49,075 --> 00:04:51,447
from the L1 point, 
you're going to come back

82
00:04:51,447 --> 00:04:52,950
because it's stable.

83
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,767
However it is unstable 
with the blue arrows

84
00:04:55,767 --> 00:04:58,998
if you move toward the Earth 
or toward the Sun from L1.

85
00:04:58,998 --> 00:05:01,595
The same for L2 and for L3.

86
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:05,327
Here we have a live illustration
of the Lagrange points.

87
00:05:05,327 --> 00:05:11,047
L1 on the left hand side, L2 in the middle,
and L3 on the right.

88
00:05:11,126 --> 00:05:18,794
This is for the Sun-Earth system
and spacecraft indicates that L1

89
00:05:18,794 --> 00:05:22,435
is located between the Earth and the Sun,
in fact it's not at scale,

90
00:05:22,435 --> 00:05:26,454
it's much closer to the Earth 
than represented here .

91
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,037
Again, about 1.5 million km 
away from the Earth.

92
00:05:30,287 --> 00:05:35,305
But the spacecraft keeps the same position
versus the Earth and the Sun

93
00:05:35,305 --> 00:05:37,708
as the Earth is rotating around the Sun.

94
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:42,889
Same for L2. Again, 
1.5 million km away from the Earth

95
00:05:42,889 --> 00:05:47,260
and the anti-Sun direction for the L2
Lagrange points.

96
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:53,423
In the case of L3, the spacecraft 
is not exactly on the orbit of the Earth

97
00:05:53,423 --> 00:05:57,295
but slightly further away,
but very small distance.

98
00:05:57,295 --> 00:05:59,486
And L3 is very rarely used.

99
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:04,030
However, L1 is used for spacecraft
looking at the Sun, typically Soho,

100
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:06,198
the solar and heliospheric observatory,

101
00:06:06,198 --> 00:06:09,662
which is delivering constantly 
pictures of the Sun,

102
00:06:09,662 --> 00:06:13,285
And there's a good example 
of a spacecraft on L2,

103
00:06:13,285 --> 00:06:16,630
in fact it's a future spacecraft
which is the successor

104
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:18,162
to the Hubble space telescope.

105
00:06:18,162 --> 00:06:21,873
The James Web Space Telescope,
will be located on L2

106
00:06:21,873 --> 00:06:25,491
and it will have the Sun shield
that will prevent the Sun radiation

107
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:29,262
from reaching the telescope
and that sun shield will, at the same time

108
00:06:29,262 --> 00:06:31,238
be an Earth shield and Moon shield.

109
00:06:31,238 --> 00:06:34,371
It will prevent the radiation
from these three bodies,

110
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:37,332
the Sun, the Earth and the Moon
from reaching the telescope,

111
00:06:37,332 --> 00:06:41,233
which means the telescope can be kept
at a very low temperature

112
00:06:41,233 --> 00:06:43,714
of about 40 Kelvin.
