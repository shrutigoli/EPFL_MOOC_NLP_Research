1
00:00:04,982 --> 00:00:08,647
Geosynchronous and geostationary orbits,
these are very important orbits,

2
00:00:08,647 --> 00:00:12,484
especially the geostationary,
for communication satellites.

3
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:16,969
We do the following:
we determine the value of <i>r</i>,

4
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:20,296
the distance of the satellite
to the center of the Earth,

5
00:00:20,296 --> 00:00:23,097
which will give us <i>T</i>,

6
00:00:23,097 --> 00:00:26,957
a period equal to a sidereal day,

7
00:00:26,957 --> 00:00:29,901
which is 23 hours and 56 minutes.

8
00:00:30,477 --> 00:00:34,654
If we have this condition, the satellite
will rotate around the Earth

9
00:00:34,654 --> 00:00:38,201
at the same pace as the Earth
rotates around itself,

10
00:00:38,201 --> 00:00:42,713
and if we have an orbit
which is on the Equator, on one hand,

11
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:45,136
and perfectly circular, you can imagine

12
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:48,974
that the satellite will always remain
at the same point in the sky,

13
00:00:48,974 --> 00:00:51,243
so this is ideal for communication,

14
00:00:51,243 --> 00:00:53,806
typically between one continent
to the other.

15
00:00:54,372 --> 00:00:58,761
If you look at the picture
on the left-hand side,

16
00:01:00,138 --> 00:01:03,787
this is a satellite
on geostationary orbits.

17
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:07,253
It will give us a distance
to the center of the Earth

18
00:01:07,253 --> 00:01:10,080
if we do this calculation here,

19
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,417
for <i>T</i> = 23 h 56 min, of 42,164.2 km,

20
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:18,651
or about 36,000 km
above the Earth's surface.

21
00:01:18,946 --> 00:01:22,376
It's important, if you want
to have a geostationary orbit,

22
00:01:22,376 --> 00:01:26,058
to have a perfectly circular orbit,

23
00:01:26,058 --> 00:01:30,984
in order not to have a swing
of the satellite in longitude

24
00:01:30,984 --> 00:01:36,961
which would, of course, have
a negative effect on the communication

25
00:01:36,961 --> 00:01:38,938
between one place
of the Earth to the other one,

26
00:01:38,938 --> 00:01:42,168
because the antennas
pointing to the satellite

27
00:01:42,978 --> 00:01:46,614
will miss the satellite every now
and then, if you have this swing,

28
00:01:46,614 --> 00:01:50,414
and it's important, also,
to have inclination zero,

29
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:52,746
because if you have
any inclination other than zero

30
00:01:52,746 --> 00:01:56,163
the satellite will swing North
and then South,

31
00:01:56,163 --> 00:01:59,049
with the same period of 23 h 56 min.

32
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:02,896
You want to have circular orbit,
and on the Equator,

33
00:02:02,896 --> 00:02:05,483
in order to have
perfect geostationary orbit.

34
00:02:06,365 --> 00:02:09,412
Now, how to get
to the geostationary orbit.

35
00:02:09,412 --> 00:02:13,534
You launch your satellite
from launch site

36
00:02:13,534 --> 00:02:17,173
at a certain latitude,
which is normally not zero,

37
00:02:17,173 --> 00:02:20,882
because there are
no launch sites on the Equator,

38
00:02:20,882 --> 00:02:23,908
and you come, initially,
on a parking orbit

39
00:02:24,618 --> 00:02:27,804
which is not on the Equator,

40
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:31,392
but because you want
to reach the Equator, finally,

41
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:35,118
on your final geostationary orbit,

42
00:02:35,118 --> 00:02:39,867
you will need to do the transfer
to the geostationary orbit

43
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,855
when you are crossing the Equator.

44
00:02:42,145 --> 00:02:44,115
Here you have the line of nodes,

45
00:02:44,955 --> 00:02:49,205
the intersection between the plane
of your orbit and the Equator.

46
00:02:49,632 --> 00:02:52,339
And the idea is to do, basically,
a Hohmann transfer

47
00:02:52,339 --> 00:02:56,276
from that point here
until the apogee, here.

48
00:02:56,276 --> 00:03:00,067
The apogee has to be
at the geostationary altitude,

49
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:02,609
36,000 km above the Earth's surface.

50
00:03:02,995 --> 00:03:07,114
Now, that geostationary transfer orbit
is not on the Equator,

51
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:10,922
it has a certain inclination
versus the Equator which,

52
00:03:10,922 --> 00:03:13,769
in fact, is equal to the latitude
of the launch site,

53
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:17,657
if you do the most efficient launch
from any launch site.

54
00:03:17,657 --> 00:03:20,296
Typically, it's going to be
about seven degrees

55
00:03:20,296 --> 00:03:24,881
for a launch from French Guiana,
in Kourou, the European launch site.

56
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:28,322
It's going to be 28.5 degrees
if the launch takes place

57
00:03:28,322 --> 00:03:29,995
from Kennedy Space Center, Florida,

58
00:03:29,995 --> 00:03:34,455
because the latitude of Kennedy
Space Center is 28.5 degrees.

59
00:03:35,284 --> 00:03:38,727
Now, imagine
the geostationary transfer orbit

60
00:03:38,727 --> 00:03:42,708
has the apogee at this point,
it crosses again the Equator.

61
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:44,958
Obviously, the <i>V_apogee</i> 

62
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,527
is not equal to the circular orbit
at that altitude.

63
00:03:49,567 --> 00:03:54,321
You will have to do
a <i>ΔV_2</i> for circularization

64
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:58,596
but you also will have to apply
another <i>vectorial ΔV</i>

65
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:00,152
in order to do a plane change,

66
00:04:00,152 --> 00:04:04,082
to change the plane of the orbit
from the initial plane

67
00:04:04,732 --> 00:04:07,436
to the Equatorial condition.

68
00:04:08,296 --> 00:04:12,154
So, you arrive at the apogee,
<i>ΔV_2</i> and <i>ΔV_1</i>

69
00:04:12,154 --> 00:04:13,850
or you could do
a combination of the two,

70
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,187
which we'll see later.

71
00:04:16,044 --> 00:04:19,013
You arrive at the apogee
of your geostationary transfer orbit,

72
00:04:19,013 --> 00:04:23,913
at this point, with a velocity
of about 1.6 km/s,

73
00:04:23,913 --> 00:04:28,536
if you departed from a parking orbit,
low altitude above the Earth's surface.

74
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:32,168
So that's where you are,
and where you want to be

75
00:04:32,168 --> 00:04:34,289
is really here, in terms of velocity.

76
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:37,558
You want to have
a circular velocity of about 3 km/s

77
00:04:37,558 --> 00:04:40,681
in order to stay geostationary

78
00:04:40,681 --> 00:04:44,092
on that high orbit, high circular orbit,

79
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:46,885
at 36,000 km above the Earth's surface.

80
00:04:47,283 --> 00:04:51,044
In order to get there,
there are two options.

81
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:55,947
Either you can do, first,
a plane change, come to this point,

82
00:04:56,734 --> 00:05:03,041
and then the acceleration
to the circular condition at that orbit.

83
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:06,473
so you would have a <i>ΔV_3</i> first,

84
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:09,536
which is about 0.79 km/s,

85
00:05:09,536 --> 00:05:11,736
followed by an acceleration

86
00:05:12,406 --> 00:05:16,447
of 1.4 km/s in order to get there.

87
00:05:17,152 --> 00:05:20,649
It's much better, however,
to combine these two maneuvers

88
00:05:20,649 --> 00:05:24,396
of plane change and acceleration,
to the circular condition

89
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:29,040
with the <i>ΔV_Combined</i>,
which is about 1.8 km/s,

90
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,551
which is less than the sum
of <i>ΔV_3</i> and <i>ΔV_2</i>.

91
00:05:33,681 --> 00:05:37,472
Visibility of the Earth's surface
from the geostationary orbit.

92
00:05:37,472 --> 00:05:40,457
You have the example
of the Inmarsat set of satellites.

93
00:05:40,457 --> 00:05:42,236
You basically have three satellites.

94
00:05:42,236 --> 00:05:46,977
You have one over the Atlantic Ocean,
one over the Indian Ocean,

95
00:05:46,977 --> 00:05:50,621
one over the Pacific Ocean,
which will give you a complete coverage.

96
00:05:51,204 --> 00:05:56,161
These areas -
pale blue on the left,

97
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,032
pale green in the middle,

98
00:05:58,032 --> 00:06:02,392
and dark blue on the right -
are the areas of coverage

99
00:06:02,392 --> 00:06:05,069
of these three satellites,
and you see you have a complete coverage

100
00:06:05,069 --> 00:06:08,384
over the whole surface of the Earth,
except the Polar regions.

101
00:06:09,336 --> 00:06:11,578
This is another subject: ground track.

102
00:06:11,578 --> 00:06:15,851
This is a ground track of a satellite,
in fact it's HST,

103
00:06:15,851 --> 00:06:20,743
the Hubble Space Telescope, which is
on a 28.5 degrees inclination orbit.

104
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:26,024
And you see the orbit
where HST is at this point,

105
00:06:26,981 --> 00:06:32,044
and you see the previous orbit,
which is somewhat to the east,

106
00:06:32,044 --> 00:06:36,672
and the next orbit, which is somewhat
to the west of the current orbit.

107
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:41,703
Due to the fact that Earth
is rotating around itself

108
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:45,751
at 15 degrees per hour,
and the period of revolution

109
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:49,220
on a low-Earth orbit
is typically 90 minutes,

110
00:06:49,647 --> 00:06:52,677
it means that
from one equatorial crossing,

111
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:54,821
like this one,
this is on this current orbit,

112
00:06:54,821 --> 00:06:56,550
equatorial crossing, to the next one,

113
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,567
you have 1.5 times 15 degrees,

114
00:07:02,567 --> 00:07:06,231
so that's going to give you 22.5 degrees.

115
00:07:06,231 --> 00:07:11,194
So each equatorial crossing
is further to the west by 22.5 degrees.

116
00:07:11,766 --> 00:07:13,258
This is for low Earth orbits,

117
00:07:13,258 --> 00:07:17,597
so with a period of about
90 minutes around the Earth.

118
00:07:18,077 --> 00:07:23,080
Obviously, if you have satellites
on geostationary orbits,

119
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,423
the ground track is just one point.

120
00:07:25,423 --> 00:07:30,364
If you have a satellite
over the Atlantic, at this location,

121
00:07:30,771 --> 00:07:32,314
that's a ground track.

122
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:34,241
The ground track represented here,

123
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:37,075
we have the example of HST
is for low Earth orbit.
