1
00:00:05,407 --> 00:00:08,748
Let's look at the effect of burns
on the relative motion.

2
00:00:08,748 --> 00:00:11,654
Right now, we don't have a rendezvous
situation anymore,

3
00:00:11,654 --> 00:00:13,902
but we have the following situation.

4
00:00:13,902 --> 00:00:18,873
We have the International Space Station,
with its solar arrays,

5
00:00:18,873 --> 00:00:22,650
And we have the Space Shuttle
just in front of it,

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:24,585
but relatively close to it.

7
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:28,802
And in the case that we consider here
at this location

8
00:00:28,802 --> 00:00:32,599
we do posigrade <i>ΔV = 1.0 foot per second (fps)</i>.

9
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:40,902
So we go in this direction 1.0 fps
which is about 0.3 m/s.

10
00:00:41,487 --> 00:00:44,116
So initially, of course,
the Shuttle is going to go away

11
00:00:44,116 --> 00:00:48,170
from the Space Station,
but as we have increased

12
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:52,136
the orbital velocity,
we'll transition to an elliptical orbit,

13
00:00:52,136 --> 00:00:55,618
and this is represented 
on the left-hand side.

14
00:00:55,618 --> 00:00:59,124
We have the initial circular orbit,
where both the Shuttle

15
00:00:59,124 --> 00:01:03,946
and the Station were,
the Shuttle will go to a higher orbit

16
00:01:03,946 --> 00:01:07,875
than the Space Station,
which continues on the circular orbit

17
00:01:07,875 --> 00:01:12,314
and will get to the apogee
at this point after half an orbit

18
00:01:12,314 --> 00:01:14,371
or 45 minutes later,
and then will come back

19
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:17,789
to the perigee position 
where the burn was taking place.

20
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:23,901
Now what we are interested in
is the motion of the Space Shuttle

21
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:26,609
versus the Space Station
in the coordinate frame

22
00:01:26,609 --> 00:01:28,626
which is as we depicted before.

23
00:01:28,626 --> 00:01:32,607
We have the <i>Z</i> axis 
toward the center of the Earth.

24
00:01:32,607 --> 00:01:36,486
And we have the <i>X</i>
in the direction of the velocity vector

25
00:01:36,486 --> 00:01:41,224
of both the Station and the Space Shuttle
at the beginning of the separation.

26
00:01:41,224 --> 00:01:48,469
Now you have here the resulting
motion of the Shuttle versus the Station.

27
00:01:48,469 --> 00:01:52,066
As mentioned, it will go forward initially,
but then it will go up

28
00:01:52,066 --> 00:01:53,970
all the way to the apogee
which is here,

29
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:58,501
which - we can do the calculation -
is about equal to 3,600 feet

30
00:01:58,501 --> 00:02:01,022
or about 1 kilometer above.

31
00:02:01,022 --> 00:02:05,133
That's about 1 kilometer,
approximately.

32
00:02:06,001 --> 00:02:08,543
Then it will come to the perigee
of the orbit here.

33
00:02:08,543 --> 00:02:12,466
And, of course, as the <i>a</i>
of the elliptical orbit

34
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:17,559
of the Shuttle is higher than <i>r</i>,
obviously the period will be longer

35
00:02:17,559 --> 00:02:19,919
as it will be trailing behind.

36
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:26,131
Here we have basically the <i>a</i>
of the elliptical orbit of the Shuttle,

37
00:02:26,131 --> 00:02:31,829
and this is the <i>r</i>,
the circular orbit of the Station.

38
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:38,712
Now, in order to determine
the height of the apogee

39
00:02:38,712 --> 00:02:43,421
above the height of the orbit
of the Station,

40
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:47,149
we can obviously use the expression
that we had before.

41
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:54,422
We had <i>ΔV = 0.3 m/s</i>.

42
00:02:55,119 --> 00:03:05,732
We know that we are going 
to have a <i>Δr equal approximately to 3.5ΔV</i>

43
00:03:05,732 --> 00:03:10,322
and <i>Δr</i> is in kilometers,
<i>ΔV</i> in m/s,

44
00:03:10,322 --> 00:03:13,006
so we have 0.3.

45
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:17,163
This gives us the <i>Δr</i>
of about 1 kilometer

46
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:21,278
which we have here,
which means that the <i>a</i>

47
00:03:22,708 --> 00:03:27,557
is going to be about 500 meters
higher than the <i>r</i>.

48
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:30,718
And this is important to know
in order to determine the position

49
00:03:30,718 --> 00:03:34,964
of the perigee versus the point
where the burn was taking place,

50
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:38,790
because we have the <i>ΔX</i>,
we've seen this before.

51
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:45,393
<i>ΔX = 3π (r-a)</i>

52
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:50,143
The <i>r</i> corresponding to the radius
of the circular orbit of the Station.

53
00:03:50,143 --> 00:03:55,332
The <i>a</i> is the semi-major axis
of the orbit of the Shuttle,

54
00:03:55,332 --> 00:03:57,026
the elliptical orbit.

55
00:03:57,026 --> 00:04:03,479
Now the <i>(r-a)</i> is equal
to -500 meters,

56
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:05,148
and consequently...

57
00:04:07,139 --> 00:04:12,869
the <i>ΔX</i> is about equal to -5 kilometers.

58
00:04:13,969 --> 00:04:18,433
And that corresponds to the 17,000 feet
that we have here.

59
00:04:18,433 --> 00:04:22,874
So all the expressions 
that we determined before, as well:

60
00:04:22,874 --> 00:04:30,790
the effect of a burn on the height
of the apogee on the other side

61
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,501
of the orbit if we start 
from the circular orbit,

62
00:04:33,501 --> 00:04:36,685
and also the <i>ΔX</i> that you get
on the basis of a difference

63
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:40,191
between the semi-major axis
of an elliptical orbit

64
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:42,416
and the radius of a circular orbit.

65
00:04:42,416 --> 00:04:46,906
These all can be used in order
to justify these numbers as well.

66
00:04:46,906 --> 00:04:51,525
The 3,600 ft and the 17,000 ft
that matches exactly the expression

67
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,548
we determined before.

68
00:04:54,042 --> 00:04:57,903
What we have on the illustration
is what we saw before.

69
00:04:57,903 --> 00:05:00,861
If we give a posigrade burn
with respect to the Station

70
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:04,694
with the Shuttle,
we go to a higher orbit,

71
00:05:04,694 --> 00:05:07,682
but it's going to be also 
a slower orbit, a longer period,

72
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:11,387
and after awhile, 
we find ourselves way behind

73
00:05:11,387 --> 00:05:16,014
after passing the apogee
above the attitude of the circular orbit

74
00:05:16,014 --> 00:05:18,817
of the Station.

75
00:05:19,561 --> 00:05:23,711
Now in the bottom, you have
just the opposite situation.

76
00:05:23,711 --> 00:05:29,538
We are here and we perform
a so-called retrograde burn

77
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:35,333
of, again, 0.3 m/s or 1 fps,
so it's just going to be the symmetrical

78
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:36,746
of what we saw before.

79
00:05:36,746 --> 00:05:39,416
In this case, initially we go
behind the Station,

80
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:45,409
but rapidly, as we have decreased
the altitude of our orbit,

81
00:05:45,409 --> 00:05:47,847
it's like the first burn 
of a Hohmann transfer.

82
00:05:47,847 --> 00:05:52,576
We're going to go down,
and we reach the perigee again

83
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:57,147
about 1 kilometer <i>below</i> the orbit
of the Station

84
00:05:57,927 --> 00:06:00,147
after half a period.

85
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:03,613
And then after one complete period,
or one revolution around the Earth,

86
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:07,160
we find ourselves again
at the altitude of the Station

87
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:09,059
but about 5 kilometers behind.

88
00:06:09,059 --> 00:06:13,300
So if you want to move forward 
from the Station with the Shuttle

89
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,047
or with any spacecraft,
it can be Soyuz also,

90
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:19,270
you'd better do a retrograde burn.

91
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:23,573
You go in the back initially,
but then you would move below the Station,

92
00:06:23,573 --> 00:06:27,208
and you move forward 
with a very high effect of 5 km

93
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:33,491
of distance to the Station
if you only do 0.3 m/s burn,

94
00:06:33,491 --> 00:06:36,281
exactly symmetrical situation
of the one we saw before.

95
00:06:37,544 --> 00:06:40,721
Now we're going to look at the effect 
of a so-called radial burn.

96
00:06:40,721 --> 00:06:44,317
A radial burn is a burn 
that is exactly perpendicular

97
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:45,858
to the velocity vector.

98
00:06:45,858 --> 00:06:50,080
Again, we have this target 
that we always use in radial burn.

99
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:55,647
This is the high velocity vector
of about 7.7 km/s for a low Earth orbit.

100
00:06:55,647 --> 00:07:01,444
And we do a very small <i>ΔV</i> of only
in this case 0.3 m/s.

101
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,879
And what will be the effect?

102
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:07,359
Basically the amplitude 
of the velocity vector

103
00:07:07,359 --> 00:07:11,325
will be unchanged, which means
that the energy will remain unchanged,

104
00:07:11,325 --> 00:07:13,812
and the period will remain unchanged.

105
00:07:13,812 --> 00:07:15,359
We performed it here.

106
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:18,102
We reached the perigee here
after a quarter of an orbit,

107
00:07:18,102 --> 00:07:20,765
and we reach again the same altitude
after half an orbit,

108
00:07:20,765 --> 00:07:23,183
and the apogee at this point.

109
00:07:23,183 --> 00:07:26,183
As the period has remained unchanged,

110
00:07:26,183 --> 00:07:32,452
we're going to have no tendency
to move forward or at versus the Station,

111
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,964
but we'll go on some kind of an elliptical
or circular orbit

112
00:07:35,964 --> 00:07:39,109
in the vicinity of the position
of the Station here.

113
00:07:39,109 --> 00:07:42,724
Let's look at the drawing 
in the lower right.

114
00:07:42,724 --> 00:07:44,786
We started here; we go down.

115
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:46,675
We reach a perigee here.

116
00:07:46,675 --> 00:07:49,680
We reach again the altitude 
of the Station after half an orbit

117
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,731
or 45 minutes, and we'll go up.

118
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:55,374
The apogee at this point,
and we reach the same point

119
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:58,401
where we performed the burn
after one full orbit

120
00:07:58,401 --> 00:07:59,680
or an hour and a half,

121
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,031
about 90 minutes period of revolution.

122
00:08:03,031 --> 00:08:07,387
Now we have been drawing here
a relative orbit,

123
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:11,339
which is an elliptical orbit
around the Station.

124
00:08:11,339 --> 00:08:15,100
This is providing that we give
the proper amplitude

125
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:17,739
of the burn downwards.

126
00:08:17,739 --> 00:08:20,381
We could have a situation 
where we start this way,

127
00:08:20,381 --> 00:08:22,259
and we get exactly to the Station here.

128
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:23,560
We can go this way.

129
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,893
This is a general behavior.

130
00:08:26,893 --> 00:08:30,014
We go down and we go faster,
so we're going to move forward,

131
00:08:30,014 --> 00:08:34,613
but if we want to do, for instance,
a circular relative orbit

132
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:38,132
around the Station, exactly circular,
we need to have the proper amplitude

133
00:08:38,132 --> 00:08:40,122
of the <i>ΔV</i> in order to achieve that.

134
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:43,520
The main thing is that,
as the period has remained unchanged,

135
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:46,853
we'll come back to the point 
where we performed the burn

136
00:08:46,853 --> 00:08:48,869
after one full orbit or 90 minutes.

137
00:08:49,658 --> 00:08:53,199
Again, we have the symmetric case,
where we do a radial burn,

138
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:57,030
but this time not toward the center
of the Earth but the opposite direction,

139
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,823
a radial <i>outward</i> burn at this point.

140
00:09:00,593 --> 00:09:04,089
So as we transform

141
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:08,019
the zero flight path angle,
which was the case for the circular orbit,

142
00:09:08,019 --> 00:09:09,662
to a positive flight path angle,

143
00:09:09,662 --> 00:09:12,833
we'll be moving toward the apogee
of our elliptical orbit,

144
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,441
our new elliptical orbit.

145
00:09:14,441 --> 00:09:17,212
After half an orbit,
we'll come again at the same altitude.

146
00:09:17,212 --> 00:09:19,879
Then we reach the perigee,
but the period, again,

147
00:09:19,879 --> 00:09:23,499
will remain unchanged
as the case that we described before.

148
00:09:23,499 --> 00:09:25,936
And here we have the Station 
in the middle,

149
00:09:25,936 --> 00:09:30,316
and we have the Shuttle 
doing this outward burn

150
00:09:31,376 --> 00:09:36,195
from this point forward of the Station,
and, again, we'll go upward

151
00:09:36,195 --> 00:09:38,617
to the apogee,
down to the same altitude

152
00:09:38,617 --> 00:09:42,211
after half an orbit, perigee,
and we have finally

153
00:09:42,211 --> 00:09:46,837
an elliptical relative orbit
of the Shuttle versus the Station,

154
00:09:46,837 --> 00:09:49,461
and again depending on the amplitude
we're going to have

155
00:09:49,461 --> 00:09:54,727
maybe a smaller circle 
or bigger circle, or an ellipse.

156
00:09:54,727 --> 00:09:57,010
The main thing is, we'll come back
to the same point

157
00:09:57,010 --> 00:09:59,326
after one full relative orbit.
