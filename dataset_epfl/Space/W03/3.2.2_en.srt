1
00:00:06,499 --> 00:00:08,770
Hohmann transfer, the case of small <i>ΔV</i>.

2
00:00:08,770 --> 00:00:10,934
This is going to be very important,

3
00:00:10,934 --> 00:00:13,701
especially when
we talk about rendezvous,

4
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:15,681
we'll use this very often.

5
00:00:16,167 --> 00:00:17,561
The idea of the following:

6
00:00:17,561 --> 00:00:21,363
we'll be looking into the first burn,

7
00:00:21,363 --> 00:00:24,475
or the first maneuver 
of a Hohmann transfer

8
00:00:24,475 --> 00:00:30,298
when we are 
on a circular orbit with <i>V_circ</i>

9
00:00:30,298 --> 00:00:32,268
and we'll designate <i>V_circ = V</i>.

10
00:00:32,268 --> 00:00:34,859
It's simpler for the expression 
that we'll derive.

11
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:39,929
And we give a small increment in velocity 
in the direction of the <i>V_circ</i>,

12
00:00:39,929 --> 00:00:46,555
<i>ΔV</i> small, I can write this 
here, <i>ΔV</i> in absolute value, small.

13
00:00:48,234 --> 00:00:52,804
So, we'll come to a transfer orbit 
that will elevate itself

14
00:00:52,814 --> 00:00:56,265
above the initial circular orbit 
only by a small amount,

15
00:00:56,265 --> 00:01:00,176
and eventually at the apogee 
of that transfer orbit

16
00:01:00,176 --> 00:01:04,166
we have <i>Δr</i> small also.

17
00:01:04,776 --> 00:01:11,046
Now, this <i>V_circ</i> initial 
plus <i>ΔV vectorial</i> 

18
00:01:11,046 --> 00:01:16,329
will give us, in fact, <i>V_perigee</i>

19
00:01:16,956 --> 00:01:20,934
however elliptical transfer orbit, again, 
only slightly different

20
00:01:20,934 --> 00:01:24,260
from the initial circular orbit.

21
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:26,068
Let's derive some expressions

22
00:01:26,068 --> 00:01:29,610
in order to find the relationship, 
and that's really what we are after,

23
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:35,120
the relationship between the <i>Δr</i> small 
versus <i>ΔV</i> small.

24
00:01:36,877 --> 00:01:39,599
<i>V_perigee</i> is equal to square root

25
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,486
of <i>2 μ over r</i>

26
00:01:41,486 --> 00:01:48,476
<i> minus μ over r + Δr/2</i>.

27
0:01:48,476 --> 00:01:55,476
This is the value of a, a is <i>r + Δr/2</i>

27
00:02:17,495 --> 00:02:20,535
If <i>Δr</i> is small we can say

28
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:25,174
that it's <i>1 minus Δr/2r</i>.

29
00:02:25,174 --> 00:02:30,134
So let's rewrite this as approximately...

30
00:02:41,815 --> 00:02:45,247
That's the first simplification 
that we brought.

31
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:05,794
And, again, we can simplify 
the square root of <i>(1 + 1/2 (Δr/r))</i>

32
00:03:05,794 --> 00:03:08,844
because <i>Δr</i> is small compared to <i>r</i>.

33
00:03:21,675 --> 00:03:23,617
And again, that's an approximation,

34
00:03:23,617 --> 00:03:28,127
but it is valid
because <i>Δr/r</i> is a very small value.

35
00:03:41,444 --> 00:03:43,076
That's where we are now.

36
00:03:43,076 --> 00:03:49,504
The <i>V_perigee</i> is equal 
to the original <i>V (1 + 1/4 (Δr/r)</i>.

36
00:03:49,504 --> 00:03:58,504
<i>V_perigee</i> minus <i>V</i> 
is equal to <i>ΔV</i>.

37
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:02,956
We see this here, the drawing 
on the left-hand side.

37
00:04:03,504 --> 00:04:06,956
So that will give us...  
and that's what we want to get at

37
00:04:06,956 --> 00:04:12,956
<i>ΔV</i> over <i>V</i> is equal 
to approximately <i>1/4(Δr/r)</i>


38
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:20,813
That's a really useful expression.

39
00:04:20,813 --> 00:04:25,943
If you want to achieve 
a certain <i>Δr</i> small compared to <i>r</i>,

40
00:04:25,955 --> 00:04:30,877
you just need to do 
on the circular orbit a <i>ΔV</i>,

41
00:04:30,877 --> 00:04:33,531
which is given by this expression.

41
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:36,925
The ratio of <i>ΔV</i> over <i>V</i> 
is a quarter of <i>Δr</i> over <i>r</i> 

42
00:04:36,925 --> 00:04:40,738
Let's look at the case 
of this small increase

43
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:44,588
in the size of the orbit 
by doing a small burn

44
00:04:45,484 --> 00:04:49,252
from the circular orbit 
and getting to elliptical orbit

45
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:52,541
that will go above the circular orbit 
by a certain <i>Δr</i>

46
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:55,445
after half an orbit, or about 45 minutes.

47
00:04:56,015 --> 00:04:58,519
But let's take the case of LEO, 
the low Earth orbit.

48
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:10,311
So we have <i>ΔV</i> over <i>V</i> 
equal about <i>1/4 Δr/r</i>.

48
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:14,311
<i>ΔV</i> you have to apply in order 
to get to <i>Δr</i> for small values

49
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:17,327
We are interested in low Earth orbit values,

50
00:05:17,327 --> 00:05:22,017
so we have a certain <i>V</i> for a low Earth orbit 
and a certain <i>r</i>.

51
00:05:23,105 --> 00:05:28,847
If we take altitude 
above the Earth surface of 300 km,

52
00:05:28,847 --> 00:05:31,109
which is a very common orbit,

53
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:37,809
and we have the following values,

54
00:05:37,809 --> 00:05:42,212
<i>r equal 6378 km</i>

54
00:05:42,212 --> 00:05:47,272
which is the radius of the Earth plus 300 km.

54
00:05:47,272 --> 00:05:51,907
6678 km.

55
00:05:51,907 --> 00:05:57,157
We can determine the orbital velocity 
on that circular orbit.

55
00:05:57,157 --> 00:06:03,133
It's about 7.73 km/s


56
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:12,661
If we put these values of <i>r</i> and <i>V</i>
in the above expression,

57
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:17,021
we find that <i>Δr</i> that we get for low Earth orbit, again,

58
00:06:17,021 --> 00:06:22,201 
LEO at 300 km, 

58
00:06:22,201 --> 00:06:29,981
gives us <i>Δr equal about 3.46 ΔV</i>.

59
00:06:29,996 --> 00:06:32,016
So, that's valid for 300 km.

60
00:06:32,016 --> 00:06:36,516
We can do the same thing 
for another orbit, let's say, 400 km,

61
00:06:37,183 --> 00:06:39,179
<i>h = 400 km</i>, which, by the way,

62
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:43,329
is the altitude of the orbit
of the International Space Station

63
00:06:43,329 --> 00:06:46,465
and we do the similar determination

64
00:06:46,465 --> 00:06:54,135
we find <i>Δr equal about 3.54 ΔV</i>.

65
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:59,802
So, let's say we can have each value 
for low Earth orbit, LEO

66
00:06:59,802 --> 00:07:09,465
<i>Δr equal about 3.5 ΔV</i>.

66
00:07:09,465 --> 00:07:12,147
We'll keep this for LEO,
but it's very important

67
00:07:12,147 --> 00:07:15,738
to rely that <i>Δr</i> is in km,

68
00:07:15,738 --> 00:07:21,398
and this expression of <i>ΔV</i> is in m/s.

69
00:07:21,398 --> 00:07:24,340
That's going to be 
a very useful expression for the future.

70
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:27,472
We will talk about rendezvous 
at a low Earth orbit.

71
00:07:27,868 --> 00:07:32,448
Summary for Hohmann transfer 
in the case of small <i>ΔV</i>,

72
00:07:32,464 --> 00:07:35,283
and, again, here we talk 
about the first maneuver

73
00:07:35,283 --> 00:07:36,833
of Hohmann transfer

74
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:41,025
to go from one circular orbit 
to an elliptical orbit

75
00:07:41,025 --> 00:07:44,791
that is only slightly larger 
than the original circular orbit.

76
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:50,981
We've seen that 
we have <i>Δr/r equal about 4 ΔV/V</i>,

77
00:07:51,589 --> 00:07:56,469
and for low Earth orbits 
we derive this approximate expression

78
00:07:56,476 --> 00:08:01,294
valid for orbits typically between 300 km 
above the Earth surface up to 1000

79
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,174
or a little bit higher than 1000.

80
00:08:03,351 --> 00:08:11,001
<i>Δr equal about 3.5 ΔV</i>, but it is very important 
that <i>Δr</i> has to be in km and <i>ΔV</i> in m/s

81
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:12,950
for this last expression.
