1
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:11,029
In this section, we'll look at maneuvers
and burns and consequences.

2
00:00:11,837 --> 00:00:14,799
This is all extracted
from training documentation

3
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,485
at NASA's Johnson Space Center
during Shuttle training.

4
00:00:18,485 --> 00:00:21,886
It was more in the form of quizzes,
but here, it's going to be a summary

5
00:00:21,886 --> 00:00:27,070
of small maneuvers we do
on low Earth orbit

6
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:29,798
and what the consequences are.

7
00:00:30,491 --> 00:00:35,647
The first thing we'll look at
is orbital velocity and altitude.

8
00:00:35,647 --> 00:00:40,224
As orbital altitude increases,
the orbital period increases

9
00:00:40,224 --> 00:00:43,540
and the orbital velocity decreases.
And this is pretty clear.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:49,066
The first one is really Kepler's Law -
the third Kepler's Law,

11
00:00:49,755 --> 00:00:55,321
<i>T = 2π √ (a^3/μ)</i>.

12
00:00:56,092 --> 00:00:58,269
In the case of a circular orbit,
of course,

13
00:00:58,269 --> 00:01:03,499
it's <i>2π √ (r^3/μ)</i>

14
00:01:03,499 --> 00:01:07,915
and that's proportional to <i>√ (r^3)</i>,

15
00:01:08,935 --> 00:01:13,798
and this, of course, increases
as <i>r</i> increases.

16
00:01:16,859 --> 00:01:19,300
Now, for the second point,
the orbital velocity,

17
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:26,221
we have the <i>V_circ</i>, we saw that before,
<i>V_circ = √ (μ/r)</i>

18
00:01:29,273 --> 00:01:33,490
So, proportional to <i>1/ √ (r)</i>.

19
00:01:34,222 --> 00:01:39,605
And that's going to be decreasing
as <i>r</i> increases.

20
00:01:42,306 --> 00:01:43,959
So that's pretty clear.

21
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:49,883
Period increases as you go up,
and orbital velocity decreases.

22
00:01:50,849 --> 00:01:55,224
Now, let's look at change of velocity
as we go in an elliptical orbit.

23
00:01:55,224 --> 00:02:00,458
We have the perigee,
with <i>V_p</i> being the perigee.

24
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,557
Here, we have the apogee with <i>V_a</i>.

25
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:11,216
And the second law of Kepler
is such that <i>r_a∙V_a = r_p∙V_p.</i>

26
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:17,768
Large velocity at the perigee,
and small velocity at the apogee.

27
00:02:19,882 --> 00:02:21,380
Let's look at in-plane burns.

28
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:23,768
Again, this is a summary,
and this is all extracted

29
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:27,433
from training documentation
at NASA's Johnson Space Center

30
00:02:27,433 --> 00:02:28,846
for the Shuttle.

31
00:02:28,846 --> 00:02:30,912
We looked at posigrade burns.

32
00:02:30,912 --> 00:02:34,701
If we have here a <i>ΔV</i>, posigrade,

33
00:02:34,701 --> 00:02:38,141
which means in the direction
of the velocity vector,

34
00:02:39,134 --> 00:02:43,668
we'll go from a circular orbit,
initial circular orbit,

35
00:02:43,668 --> 00:02:47,404
to an elliptical orbit, with the apogee

36
00:02:47,404 --> 00:02:50,568
which will be above
the initial circular orbit.

37
00:02:51,573 --> 00:02:54,752
And you'll remember that we had
the simplified expression,

38
00:02:54,752 --> 00:03:00,099
<i>Δr equal about 3.5 ΔV</i>.

39
00:03:01,363 --> 00:03:04,672
This is valid for low Earth orbit,

40
00:03:04,672 --> 00:03:11,156
and this is <i>Δr</i> in kilometers
and <i>ΔV</i> in meters per second.

41
00:03:11,156 --> 00:03:16,956
So, posigrade <i>ΔV</i> - posigrade, meaning
in the direction of the velocity vector -

42
00:03:18,050 --> 00:03:23,284
will increase the altitude of the orbit,
180° from the burn point.

43
00:03:24,773 --> 00:03:29,414
Now, the opposite case,
if we have a retrograde <i>ΔV</i>,

44
00:03:29,414 --> 00:03:30,828
which we have here,

45
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:35,461
we go from an initial circular orbit
to a <i>lower</i> orbit,

46
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:41,501
which will have its perigee
180° away from the burn point,

47
00:03:42,171 --> 00:03:47,684
lower than the initial
circular orbit radius.

48
00:03:47,684 --> 00:03:54,800
And we have the same expression
of <i>Δr = 3.5 ΔV</i>,

49
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:56,924
but this time in the other direction.

50
00:03:57,687 --> 00:03:58,987
Now, in the bottom drawing,

51
00:03:58,987 --> 00:04:01,638
we have the interesting case
of a so-called radial burn.

52
00:04:01,638 --> 00:04:05,917
At this point, we are at the perigee

53
00:04:05,917 --> 00:04:09,787
of this elliptical orbit,

54
00:04:11,237 --> 00:04:15,801
and we do a pure radial burn
toward the center of the Earth.

55
00:04:15,801 --> 00:04:20,388
So, this will basically
not change the amplitude

56
00:04:20,388 --> 00:04:26,396
or the velocity that we have
at this point. It's <i>V perigee</i>.

57
00:04:27,846 --> 00:04:29,596
The amplitude will not change,

58
00:04:29,596 --> 00:04:32,543
so the energy of the orbit
will not change either,

59
00:04:32,543 --> 00:04:37,440
because the kinetic energy is unchanged,

60
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:40,754
which means that the semi-major axis
of the resulting orbit

61
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:42,899
will remain the same.

62
00:04:42,899 --> 00:04:46,775
Now, as we have at this point
a negative flight path angle,

63
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:50,312
we are moving towards the perigee
of our new orbit.

64
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:54,187
So, the consequence of such a burn,
of a radial burn, is going to be a shift

65
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:56,644
of the line of apsides
of our elliptical orbit.

66
00:04:56,644 --> 00:04:58,980
This is the resulting orbit,

67
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,723
with a line of apsides

68
00:05:03,723 --> 00:05:06,876
that has been shifted
versus the original line of apsides.

69
00:05:09,018 --> 00:05:10,894
Now, if we want to do a plane change,

70
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:16,711
which is normally not recommended,
because it demands a lot of propellants,

71
00:05:16,711 --> 00:05:19,198
but if we really want to do it,

72
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:23,612
we need to do it at the junction
of the two orbits, the nodal crossing.

73
00:05:23,612 --> 00:05:27,537
If we want to go, for instance,
to this orbit here,

74
00:05:27,537 --> 00:05:33,267
we just have to do a <i>ΔV</i>
perpendicular, or across,

75
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:36,073
the <i>V</i> that we have,
in order to get to the new orbit.

76
00:05:36,073 --> 00:05:39,253
We need to do this
as we are crossing the equator.
