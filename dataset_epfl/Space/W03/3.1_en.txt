Hello everyone, and welcome to Unit 3:
Orbital maneuvers, special orbits and rendezvous.
By the way, we have a great picture of the Space Shuttle slowly approaching the International Space Station prior to docking to the orbiter complex.
It's really a nice picture because this view, shortly after sunset, lasts only a very short time because it's day for about one hour, then we have sunset, which takes about 20 seconds, and then it's pretty dark, so the crew was good in taking this picture just at the right time.
It's a really beautiful view: shuttle approaching ISS.
Now we'll talk this week about 3.2 orbital maneuvers,
3.3 is special orbits,
3.4 rendezvous, and 3.5 will be the case of the Automatic Transfer Vehicle or ATV.
We have prepared some practice quizzes after each video to make sure that you understand the concepts explained in these videos.
Each section from 3.2 to 3.5 is concluded with a control quiz.
In addition, there will be a test at the end of the unit.
To illustrate the unit, we have prepared a focus on Cheops, the Cheops Mission with the interview of Willy Benz, the principal investigator.
Looking at this is not compulsory, but we encourage you to do it in order to deepen your knowledge about this particular subject.
Have fun!
