1
00:00:05,092 --> 00:00:08,976
Planet Earth is not a perfect sphere.
We all know that.

2
00:00:08,976 --> 00:00:11,044
In fact, it has a very complex shape.

3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:16,594
But the major deviation from the sphere
is the equatorial bulge.

4
00:00:16,606 --> 00:00:21,822
It's somewhat of a flattened Earth
because of the rotation on itself.

5
00:00:21,822 --> 00:00:26,989
The difference between 
the equatorial radius

6
00:00:26,989 --> 00:00:29,637
and the polar radius is about 21 km,

7
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:33,489
so with the flattening of 1 / 298.

8
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,936
Now, we have two consequences
because of that shape of the Earth,

9
00:00:37,936 --> 00:00:40,927
a deviation from the pure spherical shape.

10
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:44,219
On one hand, we have the so-called 
<i>nodal regression</i>

11
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:50,218
for orbits that have an inclination
of more than 0 and less than 90,

12
00:00:50,937 --> 00:00:55,095
Orbits that are basically to the east,
we are going to have a nodal regression,

13
00:00:55,095 --> 00:00:57,611
the line of nodes 
will be moving to the west,

14
00:00:57,611 --> 00:01:01,272
and for inclinations that are larger
than 90 degrees

15
00:01:01,272 --> 00:01:05,592
we have, I would say, a <i>nodal progression,</i>

16
00:01:05,592 --> 00:01:08,517
the line of node 
will be drifting to the east.

17
00:01:08,517 --> 00:01:11,800
There is another consequence 
that the rotation of the line of apsides

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,678
within the plane of the orbit.

19
00:01:13,678 --> 00:01:17,738
We will not cover this in this course,
we'll only cover the nodal regression

20
00:01:17,738 --> 00:01:19,892
or nodal progression.

21
00:01:19,892 --> 00:01:26,259
Now, why do we have a nodal regression?
Let's look at this picture here.

22
00:01:26,331 --> 00:01:29,559
We have of course exaggerated 
flattened Earth

23
00:01:29,559 --> 00:01:33,362
but it is in order to better represent
what is happening.

24
00:01:33,362 --> 00:01:35,832
Now we have the satellite at this point,

25
00:01:35,832 --> 00:01:40,838
we have the radius <i>r</i>
from the center of the Earth.

26
00:01:42,492 --> 00:01:44,560
And now because of the flattening
of the Earth,

27
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:48,831
the force exercised on the satellite
is not exactly a central force.

28
00:01:48,831 --> 00:01:51,398
It is not directed 
to the center of the Earth

29
00:01:51,398 --> 00:01:55,169
but there is a component downwards
because of the equatorial bulge.

30
00:01:55,169 --> 00:01:58,154
It's represented by this arrow here.

31
00:01:58,154 --> 00:02:03,214
Basically this is a force 
which is non-central

32
00:02:03,214 --> 00:02:05,230
due to the equatorial bulge.

33
00:02:05,230 --> 00:02:07,442
Now obviously we have a torque 
on that orbit,

34
00:02:07,442 --> 00:02:13,611
the torque is equal to <i>r x F</i>.

35
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:20,971
And if you look at the direction,
you bring <i>r</i> towards <i>F</i>,

36
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:24,484
<i>vectorial r</i> towards <i>F</i> in the shortest path

37
00:02:24,484 --> 00:02:27,023
and this will give you

38
00:02:29,308 --> 00:02:34,566
the deviation of the <i>ω</i> vector
of the rotation vector of the orbit

39
00:02:34,575 --> 00:02:39,771
which is inside the screen,
to a certain degree.

40
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:44,666
So this means 
that this is the ascending node here,

41
00:02:44,679 --> 00:02:47,956
and if <i>ω</i> is getting into the plate,

42
00:02:48,015 --> 00:02:53,489
this means that we are going to have
a drift of the ascending node to the west.

43
00:02:53,489 --> 00:02:58,917
You have the <i>Ω</i> here,
this is the <i>x</i> direction,

44
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:03,738
and dΩ / dt is going to be negative

45
00:03:03,738 --> 00:03:07,386
a drift of the ascending node 
over the line of nodes to the west.

46
00:03:07,386 --> 00:03:09,581
If you have an inclination here,

47
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:12,479
this is the inclination 
less than 90 degrees.

48
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:18,893
If you do the same calculation 
for a value of <i>i</i> more than 90 degrees

49
00:03:18,893 --> 00:03:22,361
then you find a drift 
of the ascending node to the east.

50
00:03:22,865 --> 00:03:26,176
Obviously, if you have 
a perfectly equatorial orbit,

51
00:03:26,176 --> 00:03:29,770
the line of nodes is not existing
so in this case,

52
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:33,218
you don't have a nodal regression
or progression.

53
00:03:33,218 --> 00:03:38,273
And if you have a pure polar orbit,
inclination 90 degrees,

54
00:03:38,273 --> 00:03:40,815
in this case you don't have a torque 
on the orbit either,

55
00:03:40,815 --> 00:03:44,055
so no nodal progression or regression.

56
00:03:45,085 --> 00:03:49,117
Now you can calculate the value 
of <i>dΩ / dt</i>,

57
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:52,085
the drifts of the line of nodes 
as a function

58
00:03:52,085 --> 00:03:56,740
of the inclination of the orbits,
the semi-major axis of the orbit

59
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,914
and the eccentricity.

60
00:03:57,914 --> 00:04:02,715
Let's take for now eccentricity 0
so we only have circular orbits,

61
00:04:02,715 --> 00:04:06,411
so obviously we have the inclination
that comes into play

62
00:04:06,411 --> 00:04:08,683
and the semi-major axis.

63
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:11,601
With the power 3.5, the denominator,

64
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:16,165
obviously the larger the orbit
the less the nodal progression

65
00:04:16,165 --> 00:04:17,813
or regression, that's obvious,

66
00:04:17,813 --> 00:04:20,017
because if you are very far away 
from the Earth,

67
00:04:20,017 --> 00:04:23,574
whether there's an equatorial bulge or not
it doesn't matter,

68
00:04:23,574 --> 00:04:27,238
it's just a point very far away
with a certain mass.

69
00:04:27,912 --> 00:04:32,349
Now you have the influence
of the inclination with a cosine of <i>i</i>.

70
00:04:32,349 --> 00:04:37,020
It means that the dΩ / dt 
will become smaller and smaller

71
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:40,090
as you go towards a polar orbit.

72
00:04:40,319 --> 00:04:43,713
Now we have a plot of the nodal regression
rates and degrees per day

73
00:04:43,713 --> 00:04:47,976
so it's dΩ / dt as a function 
of their orbital inclinaiton.

74
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:55,567
So you basically have the cosine shape
of that dΩ / dt versus inclination

75
00:04:55,611 --> 00:05:00,597
and you have the symmetry 
because you have the cosine of <i>i</i>,

76
00:05:00,597 --> 00:05:07,787
you have the values of inclination
going from 0 to 90 degrees

77
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:12,819
then from 90 degrees to 180 degrees,
and obviously you have a symmetry.

78
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:16,615
What you also see here very clearly
is the influence of the altitude,

79
00:05:16,615 --> 00:05:20,477
and the upper line is for a low orbit

80
00:05:20,477 --> 00:05:23,274
of 200 km above the Earth's surface,

81
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:24,938
the lower line for 5000.

82
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:28,848
Obviously, the higher you are
the less the nodal regression

83
00:05:28,848 --> 00:05:31,071
for a given inclination.

84
00:05:31,071 --> 00:05:32,923
Now we have seen 
that we have nodal regression

85
00:05:32,923 --> 00:05:35,925
for inclination less than 90 degrees

86
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:38,923
which means that the dΩ / dt 
will be negative

87
00:05:38,923 --> 00:05:42,666
and you have a nodal progression
with dΩ / dt positive

88
00:05:42,666 --> 00:05:45,009
for inclination more than 90 degrees.

89
00:05:45,124 --> 00:05:49,654
Now, we can use this nodal progression

90
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:53,303
for orbits of a little more 
than 90 degree inclination

91
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:58,124
to reach the so-called
<i>Sun-synchrynous</i> condition.

92
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,270
Sun-synchronous condition means 
the following:

93
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:05,393
the orbit will keep the same orientation
versus the Sun

94
00:06:05,393 --> 00:06:09,000
as the Earth is going around the Sun
in a full year,

95
00:06:09,061 --> 00:06:12,239
a little more than 365 days.

96
00:06:12,239 --> 00:06:14,747
Let's look at the initial condition here.

97
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:19,166
Here we have an orbit 
which is seen exactly edge-on orbit

98
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:22,512
which has the Sun in its plane,

99
00:06:22,512 --> 00:06:27,382
and as the Earth is going around the Sun
in this direction, counter-clockwise,

100
00:06:27,382 --> 00:06:32,573
if we want that orbit to always keep
the same orientation versus the Sun,

101
00:06:32,573 --> 00:06:38,520
it means that the line of nodes
will have to drift to the east

102
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:41,214
with about one degree per day,

103
00:06:41,264 --> 00:06:45,825
more precisely 
it has to be 0.9856 degrees per day

104
00:06:45,825 --> 00:06:48,721
in order to keep 
that Sun-synchronous condition.

105
00:06:48,721 --> 00:06:52,535
Now, we have represented an orbit,
a peculiar orbit

106
00:06:52,535 --> 00:06:54,764
with the Sun contained 
in the plane of the orbit,

107
00:06:54,764 --> 00:06:57,311
of course it can be for any other orbit.

108
00:06:57,311 --> 00:07:01,191
If we want this orbit 
to keep the same orientation

109
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,370
versus the Sun,

110
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,648
as the Earth goes around the Sun
in one year,

111
00:07:04,648 --> 00:07:10,834
then we need to have the nodal progression
of about one degree per day,

112
00:07:10,834 --> 00:07:13,750
or more precisely the value indicated here

113
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,612
Now we have seen that in order to have
Sun-sychronous condition,

114
00:07:16,612 --> 00:07:21,308
we need to have a certain combination
of the inclination and the distance.

115
00:07:21,308 --> 00:07:24,896
We of course 
only consider circular orbits,

116
00:07:24,896 --> 00:07:29,865
so we are interested in the radius <i>r</i>
and the inclination.

117
00:07:29,865 --> 00:07:33,569
More precisely we have here
a plot of the orbital altitude

118
00:07:33,569 --> 00:07:36,600
above the Earth's surface,
versus inclination

119
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,169
in order to have 
Sun-synchronous conditions.

120
00:07:39,169 --> 00:07:43,576
And again, in order to have 
a positive dΩ / dt,

121
00:07:43,576 --> 00:07:46,826
a drift line of nodes to the east
we need to have an orbit

122
00:07:46,826 --> 00:07:49,573
a little more than 90 degrees inclination.

123
00:07:50,265 --> 00:07:57,528
Typically it's between 95 
and about 105 degrees inclination

124
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,643
depending on the altitude.
