Let's look at the effect of burns on the relative motion.
Right now, we don't have a rendezvous situation anymore, but we have the following situation.
We have the International Space Station, with its solar arrays,
And we have the Space Shuttle just in front of it, but relatively close to it.
And in the case that we consider here at this location we do posigrade <i>Î”V = 1.0 foot per second (fps)</i>.
So we go in this direction 1.0 fps which is about 0.3 m/s.
So initially, of course, the Shuttle is going to go away from the Space Station, but as we have increased the orbital velocity, we'll transition to an elliptical orbit, and this is represented on the left-hand side.
We have the initial circular orbit, where both the Shuttle and the Station were, the Shuttle will go to a higher orbit than the Space Station, which continues on the circular orbit and will get to the apogee at this point after half an orbit or 45 minutes later, and then will come back to the perigee position where the burn was taking place.
Now what we are interested in is the motion of the Space Shuttle versus the Space Station in the coordinate frame which is as we depicted before.
We have the <i>Z</i> axis toward the center of the Earth.
And we have the <i>X</i> in the direction of the velocity vector of both the Station and the Space Shuttle at the beginning of the separation.
Now you have here the resulting motion of the Shuttle versus the Station.
As mentioned, it will go forward initially, but then it will go up all the way to the apogee which is here, which - we can do the calculation - is about equal to 3,600 feet or about 1 kilometer above.
That's about 1 kilometer, approximately.
Then it will come to the perigee of the orbit here.
And, of course, as the <i>a</i> of the elliptical orbit of the Shuttle is higher than <i>r</i>, obviously the period will be longer as it will be trailing behind.
Here we have basically the <i>a</i> of the elliptical orbit of the Shuttle, and this is the <i>r</i>, the circular orbit of the Station.
Now, in order to determine the height of the apogee above the height of the orbit of the Station, we can obviously use the expression that we had before.
We had <i>Î”V = 0.3 m/s</i>.
We know that we are going to have a <i>Î”r equal approximately to 3.5Î”V</i> and <i>Î”r</i> is in kilometers,
<i>Î”V</i> in m/s, so we have 0.3.
This gives us the <i>Î”r</i> of about 1 kilometer which we have here, which means that the <i>a</i> is going to be about 500 meters higher than the <i>r</i>.
And this is important to know in order to determine the position of the perigee versus the point where the burn was taking place, because we have the <i>Î”X</i>, we've seen this before.
<i>Î”X = 3Ï€ (r-a)</i>
The <i>r</i> corresponding to the radius of the circular orbit of the Station.
The <i>a</i> is the semi-major axis of the orbit of the Shuttle, the elliptical orbit.
Now the <i>(r-a)</i> is equal to -500 meters, and consequently... the <i>Î”X</i> is about equal to -5 kilometers.
And that corresponds to the 17,000 feet that we have here.
So all the expressions that we determined before, as well: the effect of a burn on the height of the apogee on the other side of the orbit if we start from the circular orbit, and also the <i>Î”X</i> that you get on the basis of a difference between the semi-major axis of an elliptical orbit and the radius of a circular orbit.
These all can be used in order to justify these numbers as well.
The 3,600 ft and the 17,000 ft that matches exactly the expression we determined before.
What we have on the illustration is what we saw before.
If we give a posigrade burn with respect to the Station with the Shuttle, we go to a higher orbit, but it's going to be also a slower orbit, a longer period, and after awhile, we find ourselves way behind after passing the apogee above the attitude of the circular orbit of the Station.
Now in the bottom, you have just the opposite situation.
We are here and we perform a so-called retrograde burn of, again, 0.3 m/s or 1 fps, so it's just going to be the symmetrical of what we saw before.
In this case, initially we go behind the Station, but rapidly, as we have decreased the altitude of our orbit, it's like the first burn of a Hohmann transfer.
We're going to go down, and we reach the perigee again about 1 kilometer <i>below</i> the orbit of the Station after half a period.
And then after one complete period, or one revolution around the Earth, we find ourselves again at the altitude of the Station but about 5 kilometers behind.
So if you want to move forward from the Station with the Shuttle or with any spacecraft, it can be Soyuz also, you'd better do a retrograde burn.
You go in the back initially, but then you would move below the Station, and you move forward with a very high effect of 5 km of distance to the Station if you only do 0.3 m/s burn, exactly symmetrical situation of the one we saw before.
Now we're going to look at the effect of a so-called radial burn.
A radial burn is a burn that is exactly perpendicular to the velocity vector.
Again, we have this target that we always use in radial burn.
This is the high velocity vector of about 7.7 km/s for a low Earth orbit.
And we do a very small <i>Î”V</i> of only in this case 0.3 m/s.
And what will be the effect?
Basically the amplitude of the velocity vector will be unchanged, which means that the energy will remain unchanged, and the period will remain unchanged.
We performed it here.
We reached the perigee here after a quarter of an orbit, and we reach again the same altitude after half an orbit, and the apogee at this point.
As the period has remained unchanged, we're going to have no tendency to move forward or at versus the Station, but we'll go on some kind of an elliptical or circular orbit in the vicinity of the position of the Station here.
Let's look at the drawing in the lower right.
We started here; we go down.
We reach a perigee here.
We reach again the altitude of the Station after half an orbit or 45 minutes, and we'll go up.
The apogee at this point, and we reach the same point where we performed the burn after one full orbit or an hour and a half, about 90 minutes period of revolution.
Now we have been drawing here a relative orbit, which is an elliptical orbit around the Station.
This is providing that we give the proper amplitude of the burn downwards.
We could have a situation where we start this way, and we get exactly to the Station here.
We can go this way.
This is a general behavior.
We go down and we go faster, so we're going to move forward, but if we want to do, for instance, a circular relative orbit around the Station, exactly circular, we need to have the proper amplitude of the <i>Î”V</i> in order to achieve that.
The main thing is that, as the period has remained unchanged, we'll come back to the point where we performed the burn after one full orbit or 90 minutes.
Again, we have the symmetric case, where we do a radial burn, but this time not toward the center of the Earth but the opposite direction, a radial <i>outward</i> burn at this point.
So as we transform the zero flight path angle, which was the case for the circular orbit, to a positive flight path angle, we'll be moving toward the apogee of our elliptical orbit, our new elliptical orbit.
After half an orbit, we'll come again at the same altitude.
Then we reach the perigee, but the period, again, will remain unchanged as the case that we described before.
And here we have the Station in the middle, and we have the Shuttle doing this outward burn from this point forward of the Station, and, again, we'll go upward to the apogee, down to the same altitude after half an orbit, perigee, and we have finally an elliptical relative orbit of the Shuttle versus the Station, and again depending on the amplitude we're going to have maybe a smaller circle or bigger circle, or an ellipse.
The main thing is, we'll come back to the same point after one full relative orbit.
