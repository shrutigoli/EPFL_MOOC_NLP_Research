1
00:00:05,227 --> 00:00:07,545
Today we will look 
at the orbital maneuvers

2
00:00:07,545 --> 00:00:11,891
and the Hohmann transfer,
which is a special kind of transfer

3
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:15,150
from one circular orbit
to another circular orbit.

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:21,450
But, first of all, maneuver on orbit 
is basically <i>ΔV vectorial</i>

5
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:25,273
that you apply at some point 
in the orbit of a satellite or spacecraft

6
00:00:25,273 --> 00:00:27,663
so that you will change the orbit.

7
00:00:27,663 --> 00:00:31,324
We have here the example 
of initial circular orbit,

8
00:00:31,324 --> 00:00:34,891
and you add velocity in the direction 
of the circular velocity,

9
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:37,165
at some point you add <i>ΔV</i>,

10
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:42,487
and it will change the orbit 
to an elliptical orbit of high energy.

11
00:00:42,487 --> 00:00:45,172
You basically added energy to the orbit,

12
00:00:45,172 --> 00:00:47,620
you added kinetic energy,

13
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:51,270
so you will have a larger value 
of the semi-major axis

14
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:55,320
instead of the radius <i>r</i>
of your initial circular orbit.

15
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,083
You come to elliptical orbit

16
00:00:58,083 --> 00:01:01,054
which has a semi-major axis 
larger than the radius

17
00:01:01,054 --> 00:01:02,883
of the initial circular orbit.

18
00:01:02,883 --> 00:01:05,687
Now, we will only consider 
instantaneous <i>ΔV</i>.

19
00:01:05,687 --> 00:01:07,804
This is the a simplification.

20
00:01:07,804 --> 00:01:10,804
We will consider 
that at some point on the orbit

21
00:01:10,804 --> 00:01:13,868
you add a vectorial <i>ΔV</i> instantaneously,

22
00:01:13,868 --> 00:01:15,910
then you change your orbit.

23
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,320
Of course, you can have cases

24
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,410
where you have a slow thrust, 
for instance,

25
00:01:19,410 --> 00:01:21,620
or low value of the thrust.

26
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,993
And, for instance, 
with ionic or electric propulsion engine.

27
00:01:25,993 --> 00:01:29,695
In this case you may have some kind 
of a spiral trajectory

28
00:01:29,695 --> 00:01:30,685
that will result.

29
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:32,189
We will not consider this case,

30
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:35,777
but only instantaneous <i>ΔVs</i>,
vectorial <i>ΔVs</i>.

31
00:01:35,777 --> 00:01:38,483
The Hohmann transfer is a transfer

32
00:01:38,483 --> 00:01:41,123
between one circular orbit
to another circular orbit

33
00:01:41,123 --> 00:01:43,464
around the same central body,

34
00:01:44,072 --> 00:01:49,725
and here on the drawing 
we have first circular orbit

35
00:01:49,735 --> 00:01:53,302
with the radius <i>r_1</i>, 
a small circular orbit around the Earth,

36
00:01:53,302 --> 00:01:56,418
and we want to go 
to the large circular orbit

37
00:01:56,418 --> 00:01:58,023
with the radius <i>r_2</i>.

38
00:01:58,023 --> 00:02:02,489
How will we transfer 
from the initial orbit to the final orbit?

39
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:03,812
The idea is the following.

40
00:02:03,812 --> 00:02:07,055
We have <i>V_circ 1</i>,

41
00:02:07,055 --> 00:02:10,017
the circular velocity 
on the initial orbit,

42
00:02:10,017 --> 00:02:12,748
which is this amplitude,

43
00:02:12,748 --> 00:02:17,228
and the idea is to add in the direction 
of the circular orbit at some point

44
00:02:17,231 --> 00:02:19,225
a <i>ΔV_1</i> vectorial

45
00:02:19,225 --> 00:02:23,015
in order to come 
to so-called transfer orbit <i>O_T</i>,

46
00:02:23,024 --> 00:02:25,228
which is elliptical,

47
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:30,154
which is tangential 
to the initial orbit of radius <i>r_1</i>,

48
00:02:30,154 --> 00:02:32,682
and we want it to be also tangential

49
00:02:32,682 --> 00:02:35,928
to the final orbit of radius <i>r_2</i>.

50
00:02:35,928 --> 00:02:39,161
Now, it just happened 
that Hohmann transfer

51
00:02:39,161 --> 00:02:40,812
is the most efficient transfer

52
00:02:40,812 --> 00:02:43,015
between one circular orbit 
and the other one,

53
00:02:43,015 --> 00:02:47,269
because <i>ΔV_1</i> that we added 
to the circular velocity initially,

54
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:51,292
being in the direction
of the circular velocity,

55
00:02:51,292 --> 00:02:54,382
will maximize the increase 
in the kinetic energy.

56
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,750
If we had any other direction for <i>ΔV_1</i>,

57
00:02:56,750 --> 00:03:00,157
obviously we will not mazimize 
the increase in kinetic energy.

58
00:03:00,157 --> 00:03:03,134
And it's the same 
when we get to the apogee,

59
00:03:03,134 --> 00:03:07,590
adding velocity 
to the apogee velocity <i>ΔV_2</i>

60
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:09,007
in order to reach <i>V_circ 2</i>,

61
00:03:09,007 --> 00:03:12,207
the circular velocity
for the target orbit,

62
00:03:12,207 --> 00:03:15,947
will maximize also the increase 
in the kinetic energy.

63
00:03:17,449 --> 00:03:22,493
So, at the perigee we give <i>ΔV_1</i>, 
in the direction of <i>V_circ 1</i>

64
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,638
at the apogee we give <i>ΔV_2</i>
in the direction of <i>V_circ 1</i>

65
00:03:25,638 --> 00:03:29,780
in the direction of the apogee velocity

66
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,363
in order to reach <i>V_circ 2</i>.

67
00:03:32,463 --> 00:03:35,616
Now, let's look 
at mathematical expressions.

68
00:03:35,616 --> 00:03:39,749
We have the velocity
of an elliptical orbit.

69
00:03:47,038 --> 00:03:50,408
And we have to remember also 
that the energy for unit mass

70
00:03:50,408 --> 00:03:53,458
on elliptical orbit is only depending

71
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:59,426
on the semi-major axis, <i>ε = - μ / 2a</i>.

72
00:03:59,426 --> 00:04:01,919
So these are two expressions 
that we will be using

73
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:05,073
in order to determine <i>ΔV_1</i>

74
00:04:05,073 --> 00:04:07,002
necessary and the <i>ΔV_2</i>

75
00:04:07,002 --> 00:04:08,992
in order to perform the Hohmann transfer

76
00:04:08,992 --> 00:04:12,422
from the two circular orbits 
in consideration.

77
00:04:12,988 --> 00:04:18,148
Now, let's look at the <i>V_perigee</i>
for our transfer orbit.

78
00:04:43,305 --> 00:04:45,736
So, this is <i>V_perigee</i>, and we know

79
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:53,235
that <i>ΔV_1 = V_perigee - V_circ 1</i>.

80
00:05:08,412 --> 00:05:14,233
Similarly we have the <i>ΔV_2</i>, 
the increase in velocity

81
00:05:14,233 --> 00:05:16,979
necessary in order to reach

82
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,540
circular velocity
of the destination orbit.

83
00:05:34,027 --> 00:05:37,848
And we could do similar calculation, 
as we did before.

84
00:06:01,856 --> 00:06:05,190
And here we have the expressions 
for <i>ΔV_1</i> and <i>ΔV_2</i>,

85
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:07,615
and the sum of the two is a total <i>ΔV</i>

86
00:06:07,615 --> 00:06:10,615
necessary to go from the initial orbit 
to the final orbit.

87
00:06:10,615 --> 00:06:13,925
Now, we can do a similar set of maneuvers

88
00:06:13,925 --> 00:06:16,885
in order to go to a circular orbit

89
00:06:16,885 --> 00:06:19,885
to another circular orbit 
of smaller radius,

90
00:06:19,885 --> 00:06:22,670
in this case, instead of having 
posigrade <i>ΔVs</i> 

91
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:26,707
in the direction of the velocity vector, 
we have retrograde <i>ΔVs</i>

92
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:29,483
we have braking maneuvers as well

93
00:06:30,943 --> 00:06:33,956
for the initial <i>ΔV</i> and for the final <i>ΔV</i>.

94
00:06:33,956 --> 00:06:37,343
We can typically do 
a braking maneuver here,

95
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:41,277
come to elliptical orbit, and here we do 
another braking maneuver

96
00:06:41,277 --> 00:06:46,477
in order to circularize
in the final lower radius orbit.

97
00:06:46,477 --> 00:06:51,989
So, again, the Hohmann transfer 
is the most efficient transfer

98
00:06:51,989 --> 00:06:54,233
from one circular orbit to another one,

99
00:06:54,233 --> 00:06:58,495
whether it's to go 
from one low radius circular orbit

100
00:06:58,495 --> 00:07:00,845
to another one with a higher radius

101
00:07:00,845 --> 00:07:05,024
or in order to reduce 
the radius of a circular orbit.

102
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:07,196
One or the other, it's a Hohmann transfer,

103
00:07:07,196 --> 00:07:09,064
and that's the most efficient way to go

104
00:07:09,064 --> 00:07:11,427
from one circular 
to another circular orbit.

105
00:07:11,427 --> 00:07:12,677
This is a summary.

106
00:07:12,677 --> 00:07:15,817
You have <i>ΔV_1</i> and <i>ΔV_2</i>

107
00:07:15,817 --> 00:07:19,748
necessary to go from one circular orbit 
to another one.

108
00:07:19,748 --> 00:07:23,228
We will use the Hohmann transfer 
very often in the rest of the course,

109
00:07:23,231 --> 00:07:26,180
so try to get these values 
either in your head

110
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:30,180
or somewhere on a piece of paper 
so that it's always available.
