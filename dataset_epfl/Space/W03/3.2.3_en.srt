1
00:00:05,889 --> 00:00:08,607
OK, we'll talk about change 
of orbital plane,

2
00:00:08,607 --> 00:00:12,414
and in general, I would say,
the effect of a <i>ΔV vectorial</i> ,

3
00:00:12,414 --> 00:00:17,853
which is not along the <i>V initial</i> ,
whether it's posigrade or retrograde,

4
00:00:18,679 --> 00:00:21,736
like we have seen before 
for the Hohmann Transfer, for instance,

5
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:26,168
but we have a <i>ΔV vectorial</i> 
across the plane of the orbit.

6
00:00:26,928 --> 00:00:30,156
Typically, this is used for changing
the orbital plane,

7
00:00:30,156 --> 00:00:32,994
although the cost in propellant,

8
00:00:32,994 --> 00:00:36,414
respectively the value of <i>ΔV</i>
necessary to achieve that

9
00:00:36,414 --> 00:00:38,564
is normally very high.

10
00:00:38,564 --> 00:00:41,154
So we always try, 
when we want to go to a given orbit,

11
00:00:41,154 --> 00:00:43,485
to give the proper inclination initially,

12
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:46,231
and not have to do any 
orbital plane change.

13
00:00:47,256 --> 00:00:48,856
Let's look at the situation here.

14
00:00:48,964 --> 00:00:52,393
We have, let's say, an orbit 
around the Earth,

15
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:54,342
we have the spacecraft here.

16
00:00:54,342 --> 00:01:02,788
We have the initial orbit here, with <i>V_i</i>,
this is the initial velocity on the orbit.

17
00:01:03,077 --> 00:01:06,714
and we give <i>ΔV</i> across 
the plane of the orbit,

18
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:10,556
let's say, pretty much perpendicular
to the plane of the orbit.

19
00:01:10,556 --> 00:01:12,914
And we want to go to another orbit,

20
00:01:13,696 --> 00:01:18,643
with <i>V_f</i>, or final velocity,
following the <i>ΔV</i>,

21
00:01:18,643 --> 00:01:20,234
which has the same amplitude.

22
00:01:20,234 --> 00:01:23,433
So we don't want to change
the period of the orbit,

23
00:01:23,433 --> 00:01:25,445
we don't want to change 
the semi-major axis,

24
00:01:25,445 --> 00:01:28,854
but just change the inclination
and other parameters.

25
00:01:29,399 --> 00:01:33,725
So this is <i>V_f</i>, which has 
the same amplitude as <i>V_i</i>,

26
00:01:33,972 --> 00:01:38,562
and we have <i>α</i> here,
between <i>V_i</i> and <i>V_f</i>.

27
00:01:38,562 --> 00:01:41,339
What is interesting to see
is that if we do this,

28
00:01:41,339 --> 00:01:44,232
we have a change in a lot 
of parameters of the orbit.

29
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:49,222
We have right ascension
of the ascending node,

30
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:53,174
<i>Ω_i</i>, the initial value, and you see
the final value here,

31
00:01:53,174 --> 00:01:56,275
so it's been changing
to a very different location

32
00:01:56,275 --> 00:01:59,552
in the plane of reference, 
the ascending node.

33
00:02:00,128 --> 00:02:04,014
So right ascension of the ascending node,
or the longitude of the ascending node,

34
00:02:04,014 --> 00:02:06,712
we use either one term 
or the other, is changing.

35
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,313
And of course the inclination -

36
00:02:09,313 --> 00:02:11,707
this is the initial inclination, 
that is the final -

37
00:02:11,707 --> 00:02:13,149
is also changing.

38
00:02:13,149 --> 00:02:16,918
Now, we see that we have 
a so-called spherical triangle

39
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:20,915
between this point here, 
this point and this point,

40
00:02:22,285 --> 00:02:25,207
and in order to see 
what all the changes are

41
00:02:25,207 --> 00:02:27,403
in the right ascension 
of the ascending node,

42
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:30,321
and the inclination, we need to resolve
that spherical triangle.

43
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:33,115
We have here the argument of latitude

44
00:02:33,115 --> 00:02:36,725
which is inside the plane of the orbit,
which is in fact the sum

45
00:02:36,726 --> 00:02:41,433
of the argument of the periapsis 
and the true anomaly.

46
00:02:42,282 --> 00:02:46,807
<i>ω + θ</i> is the argument of latitude.

47
00:02:47,763 --> 00:02:51,163
We could resolve this triangle, 
of course we're not going to do that.

48
00:02:51,378 --> 00:02:54,186
The idea is not to go deep 
into spherical trigonometry,

49
00:02:54,186 --> 00:02:57,925
but the tool of spherical trigonometry
allows us to determine,

50
00:02:57,925 --> 00:03:02,465
following <i>ΔV</i> as depicted here,
to see what all the changes are

51
00:03:02,465 --> 00:03:04,782
in the right ascension 
of the ascending node

52
00:03:04,782 --> 00:03:06,792
and in the inclination of the orbit.

53
00:03:07,113 --> 00:03:10,415
In the future in the course 
will only consider

54
00:03:11,077 --> 00:03:13,622
orbital plane changes 
when we do the maneuver,

55
00:03:13,622 --> 00:03:16,577
the <i>ΔV</i> across the plane of the orbit

56
00:03:16,577 --> 00:03:18,333
when we are crossing the equator,

57
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,642
because on the one hand
that's the most efficient way

58
00:03:20,642 --> 00:03:23,289
of changing the inclination of the orbit.

59
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:26,423
If you really want to do that, then again
it's never recommended

60
00:03:26,423 --> 00:03:28,863
because <i>ΔVs</i> needed are always very high.

61
00:03:28,863 --> 00:03:31,282
But if you have to do it 
or if you want to do it,

62
00:03:31,282 --> 00:03:33,761
you do it crossing the equator.

63
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:36,862
Following the previous slide you see here

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,300
the <i>V_i</i> vectorial and the <i>V_f</i> and the <i>α</i>
and between the two the <i>ΔV</i>.

65
00:03:42,923 --> 00:03:47,453
The amplitude of <i>V_i</i> and <i>V_f</i> is the same
in the case that we are treating here,

66
00:03:47,754 --> 00:03:49,453
and it's a simple geometry.

67
00:03:50,012 --> 00:03:55,065
You have <i>ΔV</i>, needed in order to change
the direction of the velocity vector,

68
00:03:55,461 --> 00:04:00,080
equal <i>2 V_i sin α / 2</i>.

69
00:04:00,397 --> 00:04:02,660
We'll use this expression quite often

70
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:05,453
when we look at orbital plane changes,

71
00:04:05,453 --> 00:04:08,347
again, crossing the equator,
not anywhere else.
