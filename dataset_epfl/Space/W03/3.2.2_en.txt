Hohmann transfer, the case of small <i>Î”V</i>.
This is going to be very important, especially when we talk about rendezvous, we'll use this very often.
The idea of the following: we'll be looking into the first burn, or the first maneuver of a Hohmann transfer when we are on a circular orbit with <i>V_circ</i> and we'll designate <i>V_circ = V</i>.
It's simpler for the expression that we'll derive.
And we give a small increment in velocity in the direction of the <i>V_circ</i>,
<i>Î”V</i> small, I can write this here, <i>Î”V</i> in absolute value, small.
So, we'll come to a transfer orbit that will elevate itself above the initial circular orbit only by a small amount, and eventually at the apogee of that transfer orbit we have <i>Î”r</i> small also.
Now, this <i>V_circ</i> initial plus <i>Î”V vectorial</i> will give us, in fact, <i>V_perigee</i> however elliptical transfer orbit, again, only slightly different from the initial circular orbit.
Let's derive some expressions in order to find the relationship, and that's really what we are after, the relationship between the <i>Î”r</i> small versus <i>Î”V</i> small.
<i>V_perigee</i> is equal to square root of <i>2 Î¼ over r</i>
<i> minus Î¼ over r + Î”r/2</i>.
This is the value of a, a is <i>r + Î”r/2</i>
If <i>Î”r</i> is small we can say that it's <i>1 minus Î”r/2r</i>.
So let's rewrite this as approximately...
That's the first simplification that we brought.
And, again, we can simplify the square root of <i>(1 + 1/2 (Î”r/r))</i> because <i>Î”r</i> is small compared to <i>r</i>.
And again, that's an approximation, but it is valid because <i>Î”r/r</i> is a very small value.
That's where we are now.
The <i>V_perigee</i> is equal to the original <i>V (1 + 1/4 (Î”r/r)</i>.
<i>V_perigee</i> minus <i>V</i> is equal to <i>Î”V</i>.
We see this here, the drawing on the left-hand side.
So that will give us... and that's what we want to get at
<i>Î”V</i> over <i>V</i> is equal to approximately <i>1/4(Î”r/r)</i>
That's a really useful expression.
If you want to achieve a certain <i>Î”r</i> small compared to <i>r</i>, you just need to do on the circular orbit a <i>Î”V</i>, which is given by this expression.
The ratio of <i>Î”V</i> over <i>V</i> is a quarter of <i>Î”r</i> over <i>r</i> 
Let's look at the case of this small increase in the size of the orbit by doing a small burn from the circular orbit and getting to elliptical orbit that will go above the circular orbit by a certain <i>Î”r</i> after half an orbit, or about 45 minutes.
But let's take the case of LEO, the low Earth orbit.
So we have <i>Î”V</i> over <i>V</i> equal about <i>1/4 Î”r/r</i>.
<i>Î”V</i> you have to apply in order to get to <i>Î”r</i> for small values
We are interested in low Earth orbit values, so we have a certain <i>V</i> for a low Earth orbit and a certain <i>r</i>.
If we take altitude above the Earth surface of 300 km, which is a very common orbit, and we have the following values,
<i>r equal 6378 km</i> which is the radius of the Earth plus 300 km.
6678 km.
We can determine the orbital velocity on that circular orbit.
It's about 7.73 km/s
If we put these values of <i>r</i> and <i>V</i> in the above expression, we find that <i>Î”r</i> that we get for low Earth orbit, again,
LEO at 300 km, gives us <i>Î”r equal about 3.46 Î”V</i>.
So, that's valid for 300 km.
We can do the same thing for another orbit, let's say, 400 km,
<i>h = 400 km</i>, which, by the way, is the altitude of the orbit of the International Space Station and we do the similar determination we find <i>Î”r equal about 3.54 Î”V</i>.
So, let's say we can have each value for low Earth orbit, LEO
<i>Î”r equal about 3.5 Î”V</i>.
We'll keep this for LEO, but it's very important to rely that <i>Î”r</i> is in km, and this expression of <i>Î”V</i> is in m/s.
That's going to be a very useful expression for the future.
We will talk about rendezvous at a low Earth orbit.
Summary for Hohmann transfer in the case of small <i>Î”V</i>, and, again, here we talk about the first maneuver of Hohmann transfer to go from one circular orbit to an elliptical orbit that is only slightly larger than the original circular orbit.
We've seen that we have <i>Î”r/r equal about 4 Î”V/V</i>, and for low Earth orbits we derive this approximate expression valid for orbits typically between 300 km above the Earth surface up to 1000 or a little bit higher than 1000.
<i>Î”r equal about 3.5 Î”V</i>, but it is very important that <i>Î”r</i> has to be in km and <i>Î”V</i> in m/s for this last expression.
