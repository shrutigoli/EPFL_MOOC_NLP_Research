1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:07,795
We'll be looking
at the catch up rate here.

2
00:00:07,795 --> 00:00:12,034
This is a set of expressions
that will be very useful

3
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:14,954
when we handle rendezvous
later in the course.

4
00:00:15,757 --> 00:00:17,408
Let's consider the following.

5
00:00:17,408 --> 00:00:20,053
We have the Earth in the middle;

6
00:00:20,053 --> 00:00:24,783
we have two spacecraft
that are on the same local vertical

7
00:00:26,008 --> 00:00:31,808
at a given time, separated by <i>Δr</i>,

8
00:00:33,608 --> 00:00:38,308
with <i>Δr</i> much smaller than <i>r</i>,

9
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:43,839
<i>r</i> being the radius of the upper orbit.

10
00:00:44,498 --> 00:00:50,962
Now, this is the initial condition,
and the final condition,

11
00:00:50,962 --> 00:00:54,655
after one full orbit,
will be the following.

12
00:00:54,655 --> 00:00:56,522
Obviously, the lower object,

13
00:00:56,522 --> 00:01:01,568
or the lower spacecraft or satellite,
has a smaller period.

14
00:01:01,568 --> 00:01:03,182
This is the third Kepler's Law,

15
00:01:03,182 --> 00:01:06,271
because the <i>a</i> is smaller,
respective the <i>r</i> smaller.

16
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:08,918
So this is the initial condition,

17
00:01:08,918 --> 00:01:15,863
and we have the final condition
after one full orbit,

18
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:17,831
that is represented here.

19
00:01:19,922 --> 00:01:24,424
Now, although they were
on the same local vertical initially,

20
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:26,262
after one full orbit, obviously,

21
00:01:26,262 --> 00:01:30,383
the lower object will move forward
versus the upper object

22
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:34,825
by a distance <i>ΔX</i> expressed in meters.

23
00:01:35,695 --> 00:01:39,626
And we'll determine what is the value
of <i>ΔX</i> versus <i>Δr</i>

24
00:01:39,626 --> 00:01:42,643
for very nearby orbits.

25
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:48,924
Let's start with the expression
of the period:

26
00:01:48,924 --> 00:01:55,480
<i>T = 2π √ (a^3/μ)</i>,
this is the third Kepler's Law.

27
00:01:55,480 --> 00:02:02,495
So it's equal to 
<i>2π ( 1/ √ μ ) r^(3/2).</i>

28
00:02:03,023 --> 00:02:04,875
Let's take the derivative now.

29
00:02:04,875 --> 00:02:11,825
<i>dT/dr= 3π (1/ √ μ ) r^(1/2)</i>,

30
00:02:11,825 --> 00:02:16,156
which is <i>3π √ (r/μ)</i>,

31
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:20,028
but <i>r/μ</i> is the reciprocal
of the circular velocity,

32
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:22,948
so, <i>3π (1/V_circ)</i>.

33
00:02:25,108 --> 00:02:28,287
Now, that's interesting,
because we can put <i>V_circ</i>

34
00:02:28,287 --> 00:02:31,282
on the other side,
and instead of the <i>dT/dr</i>,

35
00:02:31,282 --> 00:02:36,851
we take <i>ΔT</i> for small values of <i>T</i>
and small values of <i>r</i>,

36
00:02:36,851 --> 00:02:44,312
and we can derive in this way
that <i>V_circ∙ΔT = ΔX</i>,

37
00:02:45,122 --> 00:02:48,955
and is about equal to <i>3π Δr</i>.

38
00:02:50,052 --> 00:02:54,337
So this is the interesting thing,
that the <i>ΔX</i> after one full orbit

39
00:02:54,337 --> 00:02:57,094
is going to be equal to <i>3π Δr</i>,

40
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:59,803
the difference in altitude
of the two satellites.

41
00:02:59,803 --> 00:03:02,608
So, 3π is about 10.

42
00:03:02,608 --> 00:03:06,085
So, typically, if the two objects

43
00:03:06,085 --> 00:03:08,633
are on the same local vertical
at some point,

44
00:03:08,633 --> 00:03:14,103
after one full orbit, the lower object
will have moved forward

45
00:03:14,103 --> 00:03:18,288
by a distance equal to ten times
the difference in attitude.

46
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:24,372
Typically, if the Shuttle was initially
below the International Space Station

47
00:03:24,372 --> 00:03:27,105
let's say 100 meters at some point,

48
00:03:27,105 --> 00:03:30,190
after one full orbit it will have drifted
one kilometer forward.

49
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:33,832
If it was <i>above</i> the International
Space Station initially,

50
00:03:33,832 --> 00:03:37,144
the same on the two local vertical
at some point,

51
00:03:37,144 --> 00:03:40,819
after one full orbit, the Shuttle
will have drifted one kilometer behind.

52
00:03:41,691 --> 00:03:45,847
Now, let's take a similar example,
where the inner orbit is not circular,

53
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:48,895
as it is here on this drawing,
but slightly elliptical.

54
00:03:50,324 --> 00:03:54,445
Knowing that the period of revolution
is entirely dependent

55
00:03:54,445 --> 00:03:58,244
on the semi-major axis <i>a</i>,
and not on the eccentricity,

56
00:03:58,244 --> 00:04:01,048
we can derive a similar expression for <i>ΔX</i>.

57
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:07,414
So, let's take the outer orbit
circular, radius <i>r</i>,

58
00:04:07,414 --> 00:04:13,055
and the inner orbit
elliptical, with a semi-major axis of <i>a</i>,

59
00:04:13,062 --> 00:04:19,459
with |<i>r-a</i>| much smaller than <i>r</i>.

60
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:24,310
Now we can derive the same expression,

61
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,115
which is the <i>ΔX</i> after one full orbit,

62
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:33,853
is going to be equal,
approximately, to <i>3π (r-a)</i>.

63
00:04:37,711 --> 00:04:41,592
With a <i>ΔX</i> positive,

64
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:45,952
if the object is below,

65
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,945
let's say the Shuttle is below
the International Space Station

66
00:04:52,331 --> 00:04:55,706
then, the Shuttle will be <i>leading</i>
after one orbit.

67
00:04:58,808 --> 00:05:03,821
And the <i>ΔX</i> negative,
if the second object

68
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:07,941
the Shuttle versus the International
Space Station, for instance, is above.

69
00:05:09,354 --> 00:05:12,575
In this case, the Shuttle will be,
after one orbit, <i>trailing</i>

70
00:05:15,905 --> 00:05:21,530
by a distance which is roughly equal
to ten times the difference in attitude

71
00:05:22,141 --> 00:05:25,973
respective, the distance between
the radius of the circular orbit,

72
00:05:25,973 --> 00:05:29,286
and the semi-major axis
of the elliptical orbit.

73
00:05:30,826 --> 00:05:34,492
As a summary, for circular orbits,
the drift forward

74
00:05:34,492 --> 00:05:36,812
or aft for that matter

75
00:05:36,812 --> 00:05:40,357
of an object pretty close
to another object,

76
00:05:40,357 --> 00:05:45,367
on a circular orbit,
will be equal to <i>3π Δr</i>,

77
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:48,375
or roughly ten times
the difference in altitude.

78
00:05:49,154 --> 00:05:55,136
Now, if we have a circular orbit
and another orbit which is pretty close,

79
00:05:55,136 --> 00:05:58,185
but which is elliptical
with a semi-major axis of <i>a</i>,

80
00:05:58,185 --> 00:06:08,804
then this expression
becomes <i>ΔX approximately equal to 3π (r-a)</i>.

81
00:06:10,909 --> 00:06:14,197
Always with a condition that 
the difference between the two, <i>r</i> and <i>a</i>,

82
00:06:14,197 --> 00:06:16,098
is much smaller than <i>r</i>.
