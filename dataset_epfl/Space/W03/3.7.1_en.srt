00:00:08,543 --> 00:00:11,163
Hello, my name is Willy Benz

2
00:00:11,163 --> 00:00:16,424
I'm a professor for astrophysics
and physics at the University of Bern

3
00:00:16,424 --> 00:00:18,114
in Switzerland.

4
00:00:18,114 --> 00:00:23,897
I did my physics studies in Neuchâtel
and Geneva where I got my degree.

5
00:00:23,897 --> 00:00:29,094
Then I spent some time in the USA
at Los Alamos, at Harvard

6
00:00:29,094 --> 00:00:32,701
and at the University of Arizona
before coming back

7
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:39,218
to the University of Bern
where I'm working since 1997.

8
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:43,855
My research interests deal 
with planetary science,

9
00:00:43,855 --> 00:00:48,847
in particular, the formation
and the evolution of planetary systems

10
00:00:48,847 --> 00:00:53,718
and planets and small bodies
in the solar system as well as outside

11
00:00:54,343 --> 00:00:57,077
in relation with exoplanets.

12
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:15,221
CHEOPS is the first small mission
in ESA, the European Space Agency

13
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:17,671
Science Program.

14
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:22,534
And it's something very special
because it's the first of its kind,

15
00:01:22,534 --> 00:01:26,898
and it has a bit different constraints 
then all the other missions

16
00:01:26,898 --> 00:01:29,935
that are not normally run by ESA.

17
00:01:29,935 --> 00:01:33,674
In particular, as the name says,
it's a small mission.

18
00:01:33,674 --> 00:01:41,359
And small means budget wise 
so we have been limited in the budget.

19
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:46,969
ESA contribution to CHEOPS 
is 50 million euros,

20
00:01:46,969 --> 00:01:52,082
and we also have limited time
at our disposal to build

21
00:01:52,082 --> 00:01:55,189
and fly the mission, the
constraint was 4 years

22
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:56,549
of development time.

23
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:03,755
So the challenges with the small missions
were to propose a scientific mission

24
00:02:03,755 --> 00:02:09,116
that could be relatively cheap
and at the same time be executed

25
00:02:09,116 --> 00:02:11,047
relatively fast.

26
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:14,905
And so we proposed the idea 
of a follow up mission

27
00:02:14,905 --> 00:02:18,968
to characterize exoplanets.

28
00:02:18,968 --> 00:02:25,305
So the idea is we know a lot
of planets from radial velocities,

29
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:29,265
where we measure the wobble 
of the star,

30
00:02:29,265 --> 00:02:33,897
and for these planets we know 
at least a lower limit of the mass

31
00:02:33,897 --> 00:02:36,888
besides orbital parameters.

32
00:02:36,888 --> 00:02:39,407
On the other hand, 
we know a lot of planets

33
00:02:39,407 --> 00:02:43,907
from transit measurements
where satellites have measured the radius

34
00:02:43,907 --> 00:02:47,798
of these planets by looking
at the dimming of the light

35
00:02:47,798 --> 00:02:51,193
when the planet transits 
in front of its star.

36
00:02:51,864 --> 00:02:57,434
However, we have very few objects
for which we know both the mass

37
00:02:57,434 --> 00:02:58,775
and the radius.

38
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:02,520
So the idea with CHEOPS
was to follow the brightest stars

39
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:06,694
for which we know their planets
and try to find a transit there

40
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:09,919
in order to measure their radius.

41
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,163
So it is a follow-up mission,
it's not a discovery mission,

42
00:03:13,163 --> 00:03:17,815
but it will allow us to measure
with high precision

43
00:03:17,815 --> 00:03:21,931
a large number, we hope,
of exoplanets.

44
00:03:26,918 --> 00:03:32,290
So, of course, during this 4 ½ years
of development, they are a number

45
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,804
of key elements that have 
to fall into place.

46
00:03:35,804 --> 00:03:41,858
First, of course, was the selection itself
when we got selected,

47
00:03:41,858 --> 00:03:48,649
and that was in 2012
when CHEOPS was selected by ESA.

48
00:03:48,649 --> 00:03:55,960
And then, as usual, in the ESA missions,
there is a detailed study phase

49
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:03,300
where selected missions are being studied
in order to see whether the mission

50
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:09,324
can actually fulfill 
its scientific promise within budget

51
00:04:09,324 --> 00:04:12,048
and within time scale.

52
00:04:12,048 --> 00:04:18,160
And we managed to get through this study,
and we were, what ESA calls, adopted,

53
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,740
mission adoption.

54
00:04:20,066 --> 00:04:26,346
About a year later, since then, 
we've been building models,

55
00:04:26,346 --> 00:04:34,913
and right now, in spring of 2016,
we're going through CDR,

56
00:04:34,913 --> 00:04:38,459
the Critical Design Review,
where everything has to fit.

57
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:41,196
All the models, all the tests 
have been made.

58
00:04:41,196 --> 00:04:44,140
All the breadboards
have been completed,

59
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:49,611
and the final review 
before the actual building

60
00:04:49,611 --> 00:04:55,535
of the satellite in industry
and delivery for launch.

61
00:04:55,535 --> 00:05:03,407
Launch-readiness is foreseen
end of 2017.

62
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:09,786
CHEOPS will be a passenger 
on a rocket with a much bigger satellite

63
00:05:09,793 --> 00:05:13,058
to minimize the cost,
and because of that,

64
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:19,094
the launch date will depend 
on what the main passenger will do.

65
00:05:19,094 --> 00:05:21,732
And so we just have 
a launch-readiness date,

66
00:05:21,732 --> 00:05:26,570
but this will be the big date,
end of '17,

67
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,553
and then whenever the launch
will take place will probably

68
00:05:29,553 --> 00:05:35,907
be very early 2018, with a nominal
mission duration of 3 ½ years.

69
00:05:40,687 --> 00:05:44,181
On CHEOPs, I am what's called
the principle investigator,

70
00:05:44,181 --> 00:05:50,641
so basically I'm in charge
of organizing the team

71
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:56,766
that builds this satellite,
I should say, the instrument.

72
00:05:56,766 --> 00:05:59,130
There are two different aspects
of this mission.

73
00:05:59,130 --> 00:06:03,493
ESA is responsible for launch facilities.

74
00:06:03,493 --> 00:06:07,291
It's responsible for the platform
and the consortium,

75
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:11,556
which is 11 European countries
working together,

76
00:06:11,556 --> 00:06:14,477
is responsible
for delivering the payload.

77
00:06:14,477 --> 00:06:18,544
In our case, the payload
of CHEOPS is a simple telescope

78
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,228
that is mounted on the platform.

79
00:06:22,228 --> 00:06:25,295
The telescope is able to point
to different stars

80
00:06:25,295 --> 00:06:28,857
that we want to study the planets.

81
00:06:28,857 --> 00:06:36,664
So my role is to run this consortium
of 11 countries, make sure

82
00:06:36,664 --> 00:06:43,304
all this runs smoothly
and try to intervene

83
00:06:43,304 --> 00:06:47,557
whenever this is the case;
it's necessary.

84
00:06:47,557 --> 00:06:54,478
In Bern, we have a so-called prime
of the instrument,

85
00:06:54,478 --> 00:06:58,541
and therefore, the instrument 
is being designed.

86
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:04,092
It will be assembled when all the pieces
come from the different countries.

87
00:07:04,092 --> 00:07:07,878
It will be assembled in Bern 
and then it will be calibrated

88
00:07:07,878 --> 00:07:09,391
and tested.

89
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:13,206
All that in Bern before being shipped 
to the platform.

90
00:07:20,238 --> 00:07:22,250
Well that it is for sure a challenge.

91
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:28,839
I mean from an organization
point of view, it would surely be easier

92
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:36,444
if one could do everything oneself
without such a big collaboration

93
00:07:36,903 --> 00:07:42,388
because it becomes a nightmare
to define all the interfaces, of course.

94
00:07:42,388 --> 00:07:47,960
If one piece is delivered from Italy,
another one from Germany,

95
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,865
a third one from Austria,
all these pieces when they come to Bern,

96
00:07:51,865 --> 00:07:54,889
and they are assembled,
they must fit together.

97
00:07:54,889 --> 00:07:58,710
Every screw must have in front
the hole where we can put it in,

98
00:07:58,710 --> 00:08:03,315
and if everybody does not deliver
everything correctly,

99
00:08:03,315 --> 00:08:05,637
then we have major problems.

100
00:08:05,637 --> 00:08:11,259
So it is an enormous amount of work
to define all the interfaces

101
00:08:11,259 --> 00:08:16,485
between the different parts
of the instrument that are delivered

102
00:08:16,485 --> 00:08:18,397
from different countries.

103
00:08:18,397 --> 00:08:23,972
Now the good part of such a collaboration
is it makes things possible.

104
00:08:23,972 --> 00:08:29,681
We alone, Switzerland alone, Bern alone
would never have had the means

105
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:33,694
to build the entire payload alone.

106
00:08:33,694 --> 00:08:38,808
So grouping ourselves, getting together,
creating such a consortium,

107
00:08:38,808 --> 00:08:45,153
allows the building of CHEOPS,
allows to get the funding together

108
00:08:45,153 --> 00:08:49,019
to be able to build this,
allows us to get the experience

109
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:53,440
and know-how together
in order to build a working instrument.

110
00:08:53,440 --> 00:09:01,433
It is an administrative overhead
quite large, but it is the only way

111
00:09:01,433 --> 00:09:08,279
that one can get to actually do 
these relatively complex

112
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:11,475
and expensive hardware.

113
00:09:11,475 --> 00:09:17,165
And it's interesting to work 
with people from different countries.

114
00:09:17,165 --> 00:09:20,896
You first of all get to visit 
the different labs,

115
00:09:20,896 --> 00:09:22,723
which is always interesting.

116
00:09:22,723 --> 00:09:27,076
You get to meet the different culture,
eat the different food.

117
00:09:27,076 --> 00:09:31,988
So it has an interesting 
cultural experience to it.

118
00:09:31,988 --> 00:09:34,984
But I must say sometimes,
it would be easier if we were

119
00:09:34,984 --> 00:09:37,409
to do everything inhouse.

120
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:51,010
So CHEOPS needs to be measuring 
the radii of exoplanets.

121
00:09:51,010 --> 00:09:55,165
In particular, also small ones, 
an object like the Earth.

122
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:59,696
Now if you take the Earth,
and if you have the Earth's transit

123
00:09:59,696 --> 00:10:03,091
in front of the Sun,
and you look at the Sun

124
00:10:03,091 --> 00:10:07,674
from far away, you will see 
a slight decrease of the luminosity

125
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:11,792
of the Sun when the planet transits,
and this slight decrease

126
00:10:11,792 --> 00:10:17,194
is roughly one part in 10^4
or 100 ppm.

127
00:10:17,194 --> 00:10:23,118
So it is a minute decrease 
in the light intensity from the star

128
00:10:23,118 --> 00:10:25,401
that we have to measure.

129
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:28,450
First of all, this is why we cannot 
do it from the ground,

130
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:33,235
so this is why we have to go to space
because the atmosphere has introduced

131
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:37,433
too much noise in the light signals,
so we cannot do it from the ground,

132
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:39,660
at such a small planet.

133
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:46,735
So in space is the only way to measure 
photometrically such signal

134
00:10:46,735 --> 00:10:51,095
with precision that allows us
to measure these radii in the end.

135
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:54,637
You have to imagine the transit 
takes several hours.

136
00:10:54,637 --> 00:10:58,762
The planet transits during several hours 
in front of the star.

137
00:10:58,762 --> 00:11:03,823
During this time, the satellite 
orbits the Earth several times,

138
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:08,741
and the result we have to measure 
the light over this period

139
00:11:08,741 --> 00:11:12,622
to a precision better
than these 100 ppm

140
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:15,112
if you want to measure the radius 
with accuracy.

141
00:11:15,112 --> 00:11:18,387
So we set the requirement at 20 ppm.

142
00:11:18,387 --> 00:11:23,450
So we want to be able to measure 
the light signal during a period

143
00:11:23,450 --> 00:11:27,759
of several hours to a precision of 20 ppm.

144
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:33,309
And this is a real challenge because 
the satellite is in a Low Earth Orbit,

145
00:11:33,309 --> 00:11:36,457
orbiting the Earth, 
so you have reflected lights

146
00:11:36,457 --> 00:11:38,413
from the surface of the Earth.

147
00:11:38,413 --> 00:11:41,527
You have reflected light 
from the surface of the Moon.

148
00:11:41,527 --> 00:11:43,906
You have the satellite orbiting.

149
00:11:43,906 --> 00:11:47,965
The satellite is partly in the sun,
partly in the shade.

150
00:11:47,965 --> 00:11:52,627
You have terrific temperature gradients
across the structure,

151
00:11:52,627 --> 00:11:57,378
and all that is a real challenge 
to measure the precision.

152
00:11:57,378 --> 00:12:02,510
The rest is relatively, I should say,
relatively simple for what space

153
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,838
is concerned.

154
00:12:03,838 --> 00:12:07,987
The real challenge is to measure
this light's signal to that precision

155
00:12:07,987 --> 00:12:10,346
over these periods of time.

156
00:12:10,346 --> 00:12:13,647
And this is a necessity 
because if we do not make it

157
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:17,309
to that precision, you cannot 
measure the radius of the planet

158
00:12:17,309 --> 00:12:18,733
without precision.

159
00:12:18,733 --> 00:12:22,161
And the purpose of measuring the radius
together with its mass

160
00:12:22,161 --> 00:12:27,003
is to have the mean density of the planet 
in order to determine

161
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:28,552
what this planet is made of.

162
00:12:28,552 --> 00:12:30,698
Is is a ball of gas?
Is it a ball of rock?

163
00:12:30,698 --> 00:12:34,953
Is it a mixture of both?
Does it have water and so on?

164
00:12:34,953 --> 00:12:39,363
This you can say something
if you can measure the mean density

165
00:12:39,363 --> 00:12:43,014
with enough precision, 
that is the mass and the radius

166
00:12:43,014 --> 00:12:45,049
with enough precision.

167
00:12:45,049 --> 00:12:52,549
So all the scientific, technical challenge
for CHEOPS resides in being able

168
00:12:52,549 --> 00:12:56,020
to measure the signal to that precision.

169
00:12:56,020 --> 00:13:02,262
So all sorts of technical 
development exist, baffle, inner baffle.

170
00:13:02,262 --> 00:13:07,508
All sorts of control of the system
have been built in to achieve

171
00:13:07,508 --> 00:13:09,527
this precision.

172
00:13:09,941 --> 00:13:17,438
The second and third challenges
have to do with specificity of S-missions [Small-missions]

173
00:13:17,438 --> 00:13:23,088
in the fact that we have to build it 
within a financial envelope

174
00:13:23,088 --> 00:13:27,042
for ESA of 50 million
and within 4 ½ years.

175
00:13:27,042 --> 00:13:31,676
And this means enormous stress
on the time scale.

176
00:13:31,676 --> 00:13:33,396
Things have to proceed fast.

177
00:13:33,396 --> 00:13:36,242
There is no time 
to study things at length.

178
00:13:36,242 --> 00:13:39,270
Things have to be decided, studied fast,

179
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:43,869
and there is no time to try out things
because, again, the time is

180
00:13:43,869 --> 00:13:48,215
of the essence,
and we have to use almost

181
00:13:48,215 --> 00:13:53,021
off-the-shelf components
because there is no time to develop

182
00:13:53,021 --> 00:13:54,606
new technology.

183
00:13:54,606 --> 00:13:58,451
So all this makes it 
a real challenge actually.

184
00:14:03,578 --> 00:14:06,877
CHEOPS is not a discovery telescope.

185
00:14:06,877 --> 00:14:13,571
Most all of the other telescopes 
that have been flown in missions

186
00:14:13,571 --> 00:14:17,092
that have been flown so far
dealing with exoplanets,

187
00:14:17,092 --> 00:14:21,174
namely CoRoT, Kepler,
in the future, TESS.

188
00:14:21,174 --> 00:14:26,601
Those are all missions aimed 
at discovering exoplanets.

189
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:30,391
In other words, these telescopes
look at the patch in the sky

190
00:14:30,391 --> 00:14:34,730
for a certain number of time,
monitor the luminosity

191
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:37,659
of individual stars 
during this amount of time

192
00:14:37,659 --> 00:14:42,033
and detect those for which 
a slight decrease of intensity

193
00:14:42,033 --> 00:14:46,443
can be the cause of a transiting planet.

194
00:14:46,443 --> 00:14:48,076
CHEOPS is different.

195
00:14:48,076 --> 00:14:50,307
CHEOPS doesn't look 
at the patch of the sky,

196
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:52,553
doesn't look at 100,000 stars 
at the same time.

197
00:14:52,553 --> 00:14:56,286
CHEOPS looks 
at a single star at a time.

198
00:14:56,286 --> 00:14:59,530
So you have to know where to look.

199
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:03,350
So we are looking at stars 
that we know have planets,

200
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:06,443
and with CHEOPS we're going to see
if the planet transits.

201
00:15:06,443 --> 00:15:11,575
In other words, if the planet 
is in the right geometrical orientation

202
00:15:11,575 --> 00:15:16,694
so that its orbital trajectory
takes it along the line of sight

203
00:15:16,694 --> 00:15:18,511
through the line of sight.

204
00:15:18,511 --> 00:15:24,655
So in that sense, CHEOPS is unique
in this kind of satellite,

205
00:15:24,655 --> 00:15:28,248
in a sense that it is really 
a follow-up mission

206
00:15:28,248 --> 00:15:30,669
and not a discovery mission.

207
00:15:30,669 --> 00:15:32,569
So you can choose your targets.

208
00:15:32,569 --> 00:15:34,786
You can move your telescope
in the sky.

209
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:39,260
You can look anywhere 
in the sky pretty much,

210
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:44,887
not completely,
and follow individual objects

211
00:15:44,887 --> 00:15:45,916
at a time,

212
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:49,132
what none of the others 
have been able to do.

213
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:52,431
So on one hand, 
we lose the aspect of discovery.

214
00:15:52,431 --> 00:15:56,598
On the other hand, 
we gain extraordinary flexibility

215
00:15:56,598 --> 00:16:00,290
because we can point at any target 
that interests us.

216
00:16:13,338 --> 00:16:19,947
So, indeed, the observing time,
the 3 ½ year observing time

217
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:24,466
from CHEOPS which correspond
to roughly 14,000 orbits.

218
00:16:25,475 --> 00:16:31,636
Eighty percent of this time 
is consortium time so it is a time

219
00:16:31,636 --> 00:16:39,224
for observing time reserved
for the scientists who have built

220
00:16:39,996 --> 00:16:41,315
the satellite.

221
00:16:41,904 --> 00:16:46,428
They can make their measurements
and then publish the data

222
00:16:46,428 --> 00:16:50,296
and after a year anyway 
all the data becomes public.

223
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:56,492
There are however 20 percent 
of this time that will be made available

224
00:16:56,492 --> 00:17:01,405
to the general community 
to observe with CHEOPS,

225
00:17:01,405 --> 00:17:07,497
meaning everybody can observe
potentially with the satellite

226
00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:13,125
and look at the star or look at an object
in the sky in order to make

227
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:17,298
the photometric measurement 
that will allow to learn more

228
00:17:17,298 --> 00:17:18,895
about this object.

229
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:22,562
Now the way this is going to function,
it is competitive.

230
00:17:22,562 --> 00:17:28,271
ESA will organize 
a time allocating committee.

231
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:31,905
ESA will issue a call for observing.

232
00:17:31,905 --> 00:17:35,217
So following the call,
anyone with a good idea

233
00:17:35,217 --> 00:17:38,667
on how to use CHEOPS
can write a proposal

234
00:17:38,667 --> 00:17:43,159
about an observation 
to be done with CHEOPS.

235
00:17:43,159 --> 00:17:47,994
And there will be a jury,
a selection committee,

236
00:17:47,994 --> 00:17:50,744
a time allocating committee
as it's called.

237
00:17:50,744 --> 00:17:57,834
That will look at all these proposals
and will select the best ones

238
00:17:57,834 --> 00:18:02,787
up to 20 percent 
of CHEOPS observing time.

239
00:18:02,787 --> 00:18:08,982
And this proposal will be
sent to Mission Control

240
00:18:08,982 --> 00:18:13,560
together with the proposals 
from the consortium,

241
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:19,565
and out of that we will make
a giant list of all the targets

242
00:18:19,565 --> 00:18:25,065
that CHEOPS will have to observe
during its 3 ½ year mission time,

243
00:18:25,065 --> 00:18:32,086
and then the targets will be observed
in a sequence that optimizes

244
00:18:32,086 --> 00:18:33,961
the observing time.

245
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,191
It's not convenient to point 
180 degrees all the time,

246
00:18:39,034 --> 00:18:42,872
and not all targets will be visible
all year in the sky,

247
00:18:42,872 --> 00:18:48,674
so there will be an observing sequence
decided among all these lists

248
00:18:48,674 --> 00:18:50,148
of targets.

249
00:18:51,084 --> 00:18:54,886
And in order to optimize 
observing time

250
00:18:54,886 --> 00:19:01,011
and then sent up to the telescope
to carry it out.

251
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:05,801
The science operation center
where this list is being decided,

252
00:19:05,801 --> 00:19:10,376
and the commands are being generated
to look at will be in Geneva

253
00:19:10,376 --> 00:19:13,932
at the University of Geneva,
while the mission operation,

254
00:19:13,932 --> 00:19:17,373
I mean the antennas 
that actually send the data

255
00:19:17,373 --> 00:19:21,116
to the satellite,
that collect the result

256
00:19:21,116 --> 00:19:26,150
of the observation at the end
will be located at Madrid.

257
00:19:31,246 --> 00:19:36,161
ESA will issue a call
for proposals roughly six months

258
00:19:36,161 --> 00:19:38,184
before launch.

259
00:19:38,184 --> 00:19:43,938
So this means it will be some time
probably in the second half

260
00:19:43,938 --> 00:19:48,498
of 2017 or end of 2017.

261
00:19:48,498 --> 00:19:57,607
Thereabouts ESA will issue that call
for the community to hand in,

262
00:19:57,607 --> 00:19:59,892
turn in proposals.

263
00:20:05,028 --> 00:20:11,857
This will be ESA's decision 
so ESA will decide who can apply.

264
00:20:11,857 --> 00:20:17,285
My feeling, but again I'm not 
100 percent sure it's ESA's decision,

265
00:20:17,285 --> 00:20:19,276
is it's open to everyone.

266
00:20:20,231 --> 00:20:23,462
And there will be a repeated call.

267
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:27,010
And these calls will come 
basically every year

268
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:28,570
until the end of the mission.

269
00:20:28,570 --> 00:20:32,524
And every year there will be
this 20 percent of open time

270
00:20:32,524 --> 00:20:35,044
attributed to the best proposal.

271
00:20:35,044 --> 00:20:37,991
And finally, there is 
a little extra thing.

272
00:20:37,991 --> 00:20:41,202
It's called the director's
discretionary time.

273
00:20:41,202 --> 00:20:45,362
There is 5 percent 
that is set aside for the ESA

274
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:52,452
director of science to attribute time
on CHEOPS on a discretionary basis.

275
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:56,126
Basically for targets of opportunity.

276
00:20:56,126 --> 00:21:01,073
For things that suddenly pop up
and could not be foreseen

277
00:21:01,073 --> 00:21:02,677
even long time in advance.

278
00:21:02,677 --> 00:21:09,640
There will be a mechanism that allows for
some relatively rapid intervention.

279
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:20,147
CHEOPS will last nominally
for 3 ½ years.

280
00:21:20,147 --> 00:21:24,974
We all hope and cross our fingers
that it will be extended.

281
00:21:26,014 --> 00:21:31,642
The end of mission will be
basically connected to the aging

282
00:21:31,642 --> 00:21:33,319
of the detector.

283
00:21:33,319 --> 00:21:37,993
The detector is a CCD,
and with time going on

284
00:21:37,993 --> 00:21:45,016
and radiation being present in space,
the CCD ages and at some point,

285
00:21:45,016 --> 00:21:51,788
the photometry becomes no longer accurate
enough for CHEOPS to do a good job

286
00:21:51,788 --> 00:21:53,892
as intended to begin with.

287
00:21:53,892 --> 00:21:56,439
So once this stage is reached,

288
00:21:56,439 --> 00:22:00,604
once the photometry is no longer
of the precision required,

289
00:22:00,604 --> 00:22:06,118
the quality of the science is decreasing,
and at some point, it becomes useless.

290
00:22:06,118 --> 00:22:12,420
At this point, CHEOPS will be terminated,
and there is a mechanism in CHEOPS

291
00:22:12,420 --> 00:22:17,638
that will allow it to be de-orbited,
and the end of CHEOPS

292
00:22:17,638 --> 00:22:22,161
will be its burning
through the atmosphere.

293
00:22:29,078 --> 00:22:33,879
We took advantage 
of the CHEOPS mission

294
00:22:33,879 --> 00:22:39,517
to promote science 
and in particular space

295
00:22:39,517 --> 00:22:45,022
and planets for school children.

296
00:22:45,022 --> 00:22:49,660
And therefore we organized 
a number of activities

297
00:22:50,394 --> 00:22:52,665
at the University of Bern 
in Switzerland,

298
00:22:52,665 --> 00:23:00,896
but also at ESA, that are aiming 
at carrying CHEOPS and the idea

299
00:23:00,896 --> 00:23:07,308
of planets and rockets
towards school children.

300
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:11,047
And what we have done,
we have different activities

301
00:23:11,047 --> 00:23:14,623
on the website you can download 
a certain number of things.

302
00:23:14,623 --> 00:23:18,816
For example, for the very young ones,
you can color.

303
00:23:18,816 --> 00:23:21,083
There is a CHEOPS to color.

304
00:23:21,785 --> 00:23:25,733
Then for the not-so-younger ones
or less young ones,

305
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:30,186
a cardboard model of CHEOPS
that you can cut and build by hand

306
00:23:30,791 --> 00:23:35,359
and glue and at the end you have
a little CHEOPS model in cardboard.

307
00:23:35,575 --> 00:23:41,051
And the last, for the very advanced,
we have files that you can download

308
00:23:41,646 --> 00:23:45,979
that will allow you 
if you own a 3D printer

309
00:23:45,979 --> 00:23:49,716
to print your 3D CHEOPS model.

310
00:23:50,139 --> 00:23:54,913
So you have a real CHEOPS model,
accurate in 3D

311
00:23:54,913 --> 00:23:59,245
which is about this big in the end.

312
00:23:59,245 --> 00:24:03,098
Last but not least,
we've also organized a contest,

313
00:24:03,098 --> 00:24:07,504
a drawing contest 
for school children over Europe,

314
00:24:07,504 --> 00:24:11,097
within the countries 
members of the CHEOPS consortium

315
00:24:11,097 --> 00:24:15,708
but also from ESA,
where we have asked children

316
00:24:15,708 --> 00:24:21,539
between 6 and 13 years old 
to turn in a drawing

317
00:24:22,089 --> 00:24:27,776
of rocket, planet,
anything to do with CHEOPS

318
00:24:27,776 --> 00:24:34,109
and the science theme of CHEOPS
that is rockets, planets and the like.

319
00:24:34,109 --> 00:24:42,560
And we collected several thousand
of these drawings from all over Europe,

320
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:51,635
and we have selected 3,000 of those,
and these 3,000 will now be engraved

321
00:24:51,635 --> 00:24:56,100
on a titanium plate about this big.

322
00:24:56,998 --> 00:25:04,296
And that will be mounted on the spacecraft
and launched with CHEOPS in space.

323
00:25:04,296 --> 00:25:10,540
So the 3,000 children 
will have their drawing

324
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:14,824
flying onboard CHEOPS
when the mission goes.

325
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:19,851
In the meantime, they will
be very soon able to find

326
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,975
the original drawings 
on the CHEOPS website,

327
00:25:22,975 --> 00:25:27,495
where they can find and click
on their geographical region,

328
00:25:27,495 --> 00:25:30,322
they can click and then
they will find their drawing.

329
00:25:30,322 --> 00:25:35,800
Later when the drawings are engraved,
the plate will be on the website as well,

330
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:41,734
so the children can then zoom in
and find their engraved drawing.

331
00:25:41,734 --> 00:25:44,251
It will look quite 
like the original drawing.

332
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:48,175
The resolution will be a bit less,
but nevertheless we hope

333
00:25:48,175 --> 00:25:50,233
they will recognize them.

334
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:55,644
And so then they will have that part 
flying with the satellite.

335
00:25:55,644 --> 00:26:00,203
And with this aspect,
with these efforts, we hope to interest

336
00:26:00,203 --> 00:26:05,531
school children in space exploration,
space programs and physics

337
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,997
and planetary sciences.

338
00:26:14,305 --> 00:26:22,523
Working in the field of planets,
I'm, of course, interested in a mission

339
00:26:22,904 --> 00:26:27,136
that would allow us to know more
about these planets.

340
00:26:27,136 --> 00:26:32,329
First planet has been discovered
in 1995 over 20 years ago.

341
00:26:32,764 --> 00:26:38,438
We've discovered thousands of those,
but we're only beginning

342
00:26:38,438 --> 00:26:40,594
to characterize them.

343
00:26:40,594 --> 00:26:47,766
We know a few things like their orbit,
semi-major axis, inclination, eccentricity.

344
00:26:47,766 --> 00:26:50,809
We know few of these things,
we have some idea

345
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:58,286
of their mass for some, only lower limits,
for others, we have an idea of their radii.

346
00:26:58,286 --> 00:27:01,926
But what we really want to know
is what they are made of,

347
00:27:01,926 --> 00:27:04,019
whether there is liquid water 
on the surface,

348
00:27:04,019 --> 00:27:07,598
what's the composition 
of the atmosphere and so on,

349
00:27:07,598 --> 00:27:11,105
and eventually, of course,
whether there is life on the surface

350
00:27:11,105 --> 00:27:12,981
of one of these planets.

351
00:27:12,981 --> 00:27:16,896
And that we cannot do yet
with the instruments we have.

352
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:22,065
JWST will bring us a bit closer
to some of these aspects,

353
00:27:22,065 --> 00:27:26,920
but what is really needed
is a mission at some point

354
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:33,604
that is capable of taking spectra
of the atmospheres of planets.

355
00:27:33,604 --> 00:27:37,266
And with the atmosphere,
we will be able to answer

356
00:27:37,266 --> 00:27:40,775
what the surface conditions
of these objects are.

357
00:27:40,775 --> 00:27:45,578
We will be able to measure 
the chemical composition,

358
00:27:45,578 --> 00:27:49,259
and we will be able to estimate 
the greenhouse effect.

359
00:27:49,259 --> 00:27:53,298
We will be able to estimate the climate
of these objects and whether or not

360
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:59,097
these objects could be favorable 
for harboring life.

361
00:27:59,097 --> 00:28:03,774
Now the next question will be 
to detect signs of life in this spectrum.

362
00:28:03,774 --> 00:28:09,505
This will be only possible for life
that actually modifies its atmosphere

363
00:28:09,505 --> 00:28:14,314
enough to be able to be recognized
by looking at the spectrum.

364
00:28:14,314 --> 00:28:17,764
But for the time being,
this is our only hope

365
00:28:17,764 --> 00:28:22,615
to ever detect one of these
forms of life on these planets.

366
00:28:22,615 --> 00:28:28,159
And, therefore, in my area,
the next, the ultimate mission

367
00:28:28,159 --> 00:28:32,804
if you want, would be 
a spectroscopic mission

368
00:28:32,804 --> 00:28:38,330
that allows enough resolution
in the near and infrared

369
00:28:38,330 --> 00:28:43,305
in order to detect a certain number
of key elements that are connected

370
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:49,852
to the physics of atmospheres and life
on the surface of a planet.

371
00:28:49,852 --> 00:28:53,574
So there was a proposal in the past.

372
00:28:53,574 --> 00:28:55,788
It was a proposal way beyond its time.

373
00:28:55,788 --> 00:28:58,117
It was called Darwin in Europe.

374
00:28:58,117 --> 00:29:00,089
It was called TPF in the U.S.

375
00:29:00,089 --> 00:29:04,014
These are sort of 
the big dreams of this kind

376
00:29:04,014 --> 00:29:08,936
of mission, but eventually, 
when we'll need to have such a mission,

377
00:29:08,936 --> 00:29:12,107
if one wants to answer
these questions,

378
00:29:12,107 --> 00:29:17,394
and I think everybody will agree
that the existence of life elsewhere

379
00:29:17,394 --> 00:29:22,661
on the Earth is one of the major
questions humanity has asked itself

380
00:29:22,661 --> 00:29:24,803
for decades in the past.

381
00:29:24,803 --> 00:29:28,211
It was sort of philosophy
or science-fiction.

382
00:29:28,211 --> 00:29:31,875
Today it slowly moves
into real science,

383
00:29:31,875 --> 00:29:36,153
and with such a mission,
it will then be definitively science.

384
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:45,390
Ooh that's another thing.

385
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:47,316
I think I was young.

386
00:29:47,316 --> 00:29:54,044
I was like 13, 14 years old
when astronauts set foot on the Moon.

387
00:29:54,044 --> 00:29:59,089
And so as a boy, the combination

388
00:29:59,089 --> 00:30:07,776
of astronauts, planets, rockets 
sort of made it for me,

389
00:30:07,776 --> 00:30:11,819
and I think when I started 
to really think

390
00:30:11,819 --> 00:30:14,845
this is a cool thing to do.

391
00:30:15,463 --> 00:30:19,316
In the meantime, I never quite
mustered the courage

392
00:30:19,316 --> 00:30:21,449
to become an astronaut.

393
00:30:21,449 --> 00:30:26,632
So I remained a scientist,
but I still feel this question's

394
00:30:26,632 --> 00:30:29,067
extraordinarily interesting.

395
00:30:29,067 --> 00:30:36,974
What I like in particular about exoplanets
is that the field is barely 20 years old,

396
00:30:37,441 --> 00:30:42,376
meaning it is very young,
meaning there is lots to discover,

397
00:30:42,376 --> 00:30:50,697
and what we're doing is really 
sort of first order studies

398
00:30:50,697 --> 00:30:52,135
of these things.

399
00:30:52,135 --> 00:30:56,500
We are not tuning the fifth digit 
of the comma,

400
00:30:56,500 --> 00:31:01,202
but we are really at the forefront 
of a new discovery

401
00:31:01,202 --> 00:31:07,583
of plowing through the unknown territories
that are revealed to us

402
00:31:07,583 --> 00:31:09,414
slowly with time.

403
00:31:09,414 --> 00:31:16,355
And I think this combination
of a new field, exciting physics,

404
00:31:16,355 --> 00:31:22,957
exciting chemistry together 
with extraordinary technology,

405
00:31:22,957 --> 00:31:28,377
space, that makes it for me
extraordinarily appealing,

406
00:31:28,377 --> 00:31:33,629
and I've never found a boring minute

407
00:31:33,629 --> 00:31:35,965
ever since I choose to work in there.
