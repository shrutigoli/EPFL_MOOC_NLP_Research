Today we will look at the orbital maneuvers and the Hohmann transfer, which is a special kind of transfer from one circular orbit to another circular orbit.
But, first of all, maneuver on orbit is basically <i>Î”V vectorial</i> that you apply at some point in the orbit of a satellite or spacecraft so that you will change the orbit.
We have here the example of initial circular orbit, and you add velocity in the direction of the circular velocity, at some point you add <i>Î”V</i>, and it will change the orbit to an elliptical orbit of high energy.
You basically added energy to the orbit, you added kinetic energy, so you will have a larger value of the semi-major axis instead of the radius <i>r</i> of your initial circular orbit.
You come to elliptical orbit which has a semi-major axis larger than the radius of the initial circular orbit.
Now, we will only consider instantaneous <i>Î”V</i>.
This is the a simplification.
We will consider that at some point on the orbit you add a vectorial <i>Î”V</i> instantaneously, then you change your orbit.
Of course, you can have cases where you have a slow thrust, for instance, or low value of the thrust.
And, for instance, with ionic or electric propulsion engine.
In this case you may have some kind of a spiral trajectory that will result.
We will not consider this case, but only instantaneous <i>Î”Vs</i>, vectorial <i>Î”Vs</i>.
The Hohmann transfer is a transfer between one circular orbit to another circular orbit around the same central body, and here on the drawing we have first circular orbit with the radius <i>r_1</i>, a small circular orbit around the Earth, and we want to go to the large circular orbit with the radius <i>r_2</i>.
How will we transfer from the initial orbit to the final orbit?
The idea is the following.
We have <i>V_circ 1</i>, the circular velocity on the initial orbit, which is this amplitude, and the idea is to add in the direction of the circular orbit at some point a <i>Î”V_1</i> vectorial in order to come to so-called transfer orbit <i>O_T</i>, which is elliptical, which is tangential to the initial orbit of radius <i>r_1</i>, and we want it to be also tangential to the final orbit of radius <i>r_2</i>.
Now, it just happened that Hohmann transfer is the most efficient transfer between one circular orbit and the other one, because <i>Î”V_1</i> that we added to the circular velocity initially, being in the direction of the circular velocity, will maximize the increase in the kinetic energy.
If we had any other direction for <i>Î”V_1</i>, obviously we will not mazimize the increase in kinetic energy.
And it's the same when we get to the apogee, adding velocity to the apogee velocity <i>Î”V_2</i> in order to reach <i>V_circ 2</i>, the circular velocity for the target orbit, will maximize also the increase in the kinetic energy.
So, at the perigee we give <i>Î”V_1</i>, in the direction of <i>V_circ 1</i> at the apogee we give <i>Î”V_2</i> in the direction of <i>V_circ 1</i> in the direction of the apogee velocity in order to reach <i>V_circ 2</i>.
Now, let's look at mathematical expressions.
We have the velocity of an elliptical orbit.
And we have to remember also that the energy for unit mass on elliptical orbit is only depending on the semi-major axis, <i>Îµ = - Î¼ / 2a</i>.
So these are two expressions that we will be using in order to determine <i>Î”V_1</i> necessary and the <i>Î”V_2</i> in order to perform the Hohmann transfer from the two circular orbits in consideration.
Now, let's look at the <i>V_perigee</i> for our transfer orbit.
So, this is <i>V_perigee</i>, and we know that <i>Î”V_1 = V_perigee - V_circ 1</i>.
Similarly we have the <i>Î”V_2</i>, the increase in velocity necessary in order to reach circular velocity of the destination orbit.
And we could do similar calculation, as we did before.
And here we have the expressions for <i>Î”V_1</i> and <i>Î”V_2</i>, and the sum of the two is a total <i>Î”V</i> necessary to go from the initial orbit to the final orbit.
Now, we can do a similar set of maneuvers in order to go to a circular orbit to another circular orbit of smaller radius, in this case, instead of having posigrade <i>Î”Vs</i> in the direction of the velocity vector, we have retrograde <i>Î”Vs</i> we have braking maneuvers as well for the initial <i>Î”V</i> and for the final <i>Î”V</i>.
We can typically do a braking maneuver here, come to elliptical orbit, and here we do another braking maneuver in order to circularize in the final lower radius orbit.
So, again, the Hohmann transfer is the most efficient transfer from one circular orbit to another one, whether it's to go from one low radius circular orbit to another one with a higher radius or in order to reduce the radius of a circular orbit.
One or the other, it's a Hohmann transfer, and that's the most efficient way to go from one circular to another circular orbit.
This is a summary.
You have <i>Î”V_1</i> and <i>Î”V_2</i> necessary to go from one circular orbit to another one.
We will use the Hohmann transfer very often in the rest of the course, so try to get these values either in your head or somewhere on a piece of paper so that it's always available.
