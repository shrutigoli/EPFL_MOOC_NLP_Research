00:00:05,695 --> 00:00:08,228
We hope that you enjoyed
this week with us.

2
00:00:08,228 --> 00:00:11,636
I would like you to focus
on the concepts presented in this unit.

3
00:00:12,156 --> 00:00:14,305
Once these concepts
are clearly understood,

4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:15,629
including their application,

5
00:00:15,629 --> 00:00:17,882
you can take the final test of the unit.

6
00:00:18,582 --> 00:00:23,339
We'd like to remind you about the focus
on the CHEOPS satellite,

7
00:00:23,842 --> 00:00:26,864
with the interview of the principal
investigator, Willy Benz.

8
00:00:26,864 --> 00:00:27,874
Thanks.
