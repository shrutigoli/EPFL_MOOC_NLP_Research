OK, we'll talk about change of orbital plane, and in general, I would say, the effect of a <i>Î”V vectorial</i> , which is not along the <i>V initial</i> , whether it's posigrade or retrograde, like we have seen before for the Hohmann Transfer, for instance, but we have a <i>Î”V vectorial</i> across the plane of the orbit.
Typically, this is used for changing the orbital plane, although the cost in propellant, respectively the value of <i>Î”V</i> necessary to achieve that is normally very high.
So we always try, when we want to go to a given orbit, to give the proper inclination initially, and not have to do any orbital plane change.
Let's look at the situation here.
We have, let's say, an orbit around the Earth, we have the spacecraft here.
We have the initial orbit here, with <i>V_i</i>, this is the initial velocity on the orbit. and we give <i>Î”V</i> across the plane of the orbit, let's say, pretty much perpendicular to the plane of the orbit.
And we want to go to another orbit, with <i>V_f</i>, or final velocity, following the <i>Î”V</i>, which has the same amplitude.
So we don't want to change the period of the orbit, we don't want to change the semi-major axis, but just change the inclination and other parameters.
So this is <i>V_f</i>, which has the same amplitude as <i>V_i</i>, and we have <i>Î±</i> here, between <i>V_i</i> and <i>V_f</i>.
What is interesting to see is that if we do this, we have a change in a lot of parameters of the orbit.
We have right ascension of the ascending node,
<i>Î©_i</i>, the initial value, and you see the final value here, so it's been changing to a very different location in the plane of reference, the ascending node.
So right ascension of the ascending node, or the longitude of the ascending node, we use either one term or the other, is changing.
And of course the inclination - this is the initial inclination, that is the final - is also changing.
Now, we see that we have a so-called spherical triangle between this point here, this point and this point, and in order to see what all the changes are in the right ascension of the ascending node, and the inclination, we need to resolve that spherical triangle.
We have here the argument of latitude which is inside the plane of the orbit, which is in fact the sum of the argument of the periapsis and the true anomaly.
<i>Ï‰ + Î¸</i> is the argument of latitude.
We could resolve this triangle, of course we're not going to do that.
The idea is not to go deep into spherical trigonometry, but the tool of spherical trigonometry allows us to determine, following <i>Î”V</i> as depicted here, to see what all the changes are in the right ascension of the ascending node and in the inclination of the orbit.
In the future in the course will only consider orbital plane changes when we do the maneuver, the <i>Î”V</i> across the plane of the orbit when we are crossing the equator, because on the one hand that's the most efficient way of changing the inclination of the orbit.
If you really want to do that, then again it's never recommended because <i>Î”Vs</i> needed are always very high.
But if you have to do it or if you want to do it, you do it crossing the equator.
Following the previous slide you see here the <i>V_i</i> vectorial and the <i>V_f</i> and the <i>Î±</i> and between the two the <i>Î”V</i>.
The amplitude of <i>V_i</i> and <i>V_f</i> is the same in the case that we are treating here, and it's a simple geometry.
You have <i>Î”V</i>, needed in order to change the direction of the velocity vector, equal <i>2 V_i sin Î± / 2</i>.
We'll use this expression quite often when we look at orbital plane changes, again, crossing the equator, not anywhere else.
