1
00:00:05,732 --> 00:00:10,042
This video is about rendezvous sensors
and rendezvous control,

2
00:00:10,042 --> 00:00:14,665
for the Space Shuttle specifically
what the crew had available,

3
00:00:14,665 --> 00:00:18,356
in order, on one hand, to do updating
of the relative state vector

4
00:00:18,356 --> 00:00:23,601
of a chaser versus target
using sensor data,

5
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:26,865
and on the other hand
for the control,

6
00:00:26,865 --> 00:00:30,839
the controls that were available
for commanding rotation and translation

7
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:33,424
to perform manually
the end portion of the rendezvous

8
00:00:33,424 --> 00:00:37,353
until the grapple point for Hubble,
or the docking point

9
00:00:37,353 --> 00:00:39,742
for the International Space Station.

10
00:00:39,742 --> 00:00:43,424
Now, as far as the rendezvous sensors
are concerned, we had Star Trackers

11
00:00:43,424 --> 00:00:45,396
located in the forward fuselage,

12
00:00:45,396 --> 00:00:49,127
one of them looking straight up.

13
00:00:49,127 --> 00:00:55,102
This is a so-called <i>- Z Star Tracker,</i>
looking straight up,

14
00:00:55,102 --> 00:00:57,179
perpendicular to the plane of the wings,

15
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:02,126
but in the opposite direction
from the belly of the spacecraft,

16
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:07,250
and this one was
a so-called <i>- Y Star Tracker,</i>

17
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,986
looking to the port side.

18
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:13,776
Now, again, looking at the target
using any of these sensors

19
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:17,294
was giving us azimuth and elevation,

20
00:01:17,294 --> 00:01:20,471
and through Kalman filtering,
this could be introduced

21
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:23,124
into the relative state vector
for more accuracy

22
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:27,087
and for keeping the error
of the relative state vector

23
00:01:27,087 --> 00:01:30,409
as small as possible.
Obviously, we had a rendezvous radar

24
00:01:30,409 --> 00:01:32,353
for the final portion of the rendezvous.

25
00:01:32,353 --> 00:01:35,004
This was giving us not only
azimuth and elevation -

26
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:37,435
this was, of course,
the orientation of the antenna,

27
00:01:37,435 --> 00:01:39,257
which was pointed to the target -

28
00:01:39,257 --> 00:01:41,970
but also range and range rates.

29
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:44,961
Another one that we had available
was a so-called <i>COAS,</i>

30
00:01:44,961 --> 00:01:46,384
Crew Optical Alignment Sight.

31
00:01:46,384 --> 00:01:51,277
It was basically like a gun sight,
that was available to the crew

32
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,802
looking exactly in the <i>- Z</i> direction

33
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:56,894
pretty much like the <i>- Z</i> Star Tracker.

34
00:01:56,894 --> 00:02:00,191
And the crew could use this in order
to see the position of the target

35
00:02:00,191 --> 00:02:03,602
versus the <i>- Z</i> body vector
of the Space Shuttle.

36
00:02:05,252 --> 00:02:08,529
Now, rendezvous burn execution:
we have to do all these <i>ΔVs</i>

37
00:02:08,529 --> 00:02:10,262
during the whole rendezvous profile,

38
00:02:10,262 --> 00:02:14,459
and either we have a small <i>ΔV</i>
or a large <i>ΔV</i> to perform,

39
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:17,583
and the Shuttle was equipped
with different kinds of thrusters.

40
00:02:18,273 --> 00:02:19,717
The most powerful thrusters

41
00:02:19,717 --> 00:02:22,664
were the so-called <i>OMS Thrusters</i>,
Orbital Maneuvering System.

42
00:02:22,664 --> 00:02:26,027
If we had a <i>ΔV</i> of, typically,
a few feet per second,

43
00:02:26,027 --> 00:02:28,163
then we would use the OMS Thrusters,

44
00:02:28,163 --> 00:02:30,926
located in the the arm fuselage,
in the aft fuselage,

45
00:02:30,926 --> 00:02:34,671
and giving us a relatively large <i>ΔV</i>
for each maneuver.

46
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:36,376
If we had to do a small <i>ΔV</i>,

47
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:39,043
we would use a so-called <i>+ X RCS</i>,

48
00:02:39,043 --> 00:02:41,718
RCS for Reaction Control System.

49
00:02:41,718 --> 00:02:44,550
There were 38 total small thrusters,

50
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:48,166
in the nose and in the aft portion
of the fuselage of the Shuttle,

51
00:02:48,166 --> 00:02:52,217
and if we were using the <i>+ X</i>,
so we're firing only the ones

52
00:02:52,217 --> 00:02:55,328
that were in the back
in order to give us small <i>ΔVs</i>,

53
00:02:55,328 --> 00:02:57,920
typically a fraction of a foot per second,

54
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,056
or maybe one or two feet per second.

55
00:03:00,056 --> 00:03:04,887
There was also the possibility
of not orienting the Shuttle

56
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:07,334
so that the <i>ΔV</i> was going to be

57
00:03:07,334 --> 00:03:09,730
in the <i>X</i> direction
of the Space Shuttle itself,

58
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:13,638
but we could do a <i>Multiaxis RCS</i>
to give us, in a certain direction,

59
00:03:13,638 --> 00:03:17,123
versus the body of the Space Shuttle,
a given <i>ΔV</i>,

60
00:03:17,123 --> 00:03:20,335
using several reaction control
system motors.

61
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:23,796
Now, in the final portion
of the rendezvous, the crew,

62
00:03:23,796 --> 00:03:27,548
typically the Commander and Pilot,
and here we have John Young

63
00:03:28,133 --> 00:03:31,187
on the left-hand side,
the Commander of STS-1,

64
00:03:31,187 --> 00:03:36,320
the first Space Shuttle flight,
which was on the 12th of April, 1981,

65
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:39,561
and we have Bob Crippen,
who was the pilot of the same mission.

66
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:41,658
And here they are still
in their space suits,

67
00:03:41,658 --> 00:03:45,362
located in the so-called <i>aft flight deck</i>
of the Space Shuttle.

68
00:03:45,362 --> 00:03:47,418
And from the aft flight deck
it was possible

69
00:03:47,418 --> 00:03:50,595
to control the Space Shuttle movement.

70
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:53,015
We had the so-called
<i>rotation hand controller,</i>

71
00:03:53,015 --> 00:03:55,582
pretty much like a stick
that we could command

72
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:57,767
3 degrees of freedom rotation with it.

73
00:03:57,767 --> 00:04:01,985
We had, on one hand,
the so-called <i>pitch</i>, here,

74
00:04:01,985 --> 00:04:04,095
and we had also the <i>roll</i> and the <i>yaw</i>,

75
00:04:04,095 --> 00:04:06,417
which could be commanded with the RHC.

76
00:04:06,417 --> 00:04:09,041
And we had also
the <i>translation hand controller</i>,

77
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:12,604
a small controller,
pretty much like a mushroom,

78
00:04:12,604 --> 00:04:15,519
and we could either push it and pull it,

79
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,198
and it would make this kind of motion,

80
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:20,827
and we could either decide,

81
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:24,373
by means of the switch on the aft panel,

82
00:04:24,853 --> 00:04:28,304
that this motion
of the translation hand controller

83
00:04:28,304 --> 00:04:31,758
was going to be commanding <i>- Z</i>,

84
00:04:31,758 --> 00:04:35,872
respectively, <i>+ Z</i> direction,

85
00:04:35,872 --> 00:04:42,080
or it could be a so-called <i>- X</i> or <i>+ X</i>,

86
00:04:42,629 --> 00:04:45,875
and whether this translation hand control
was commanding <i>Z</i> or <i>X</i>,

87
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,723
respectively, <i>- Z</i> or <i>- X</i>

88
00:04:47,723 --> 00:04:50,273
was determined
by the position of that switch.

89
00:04:50,273 --> 00:04:53,167
And it was the same, also,
for the rotation hand controller;

90
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:57,760
that switch, <i>- Z</i> or <i>- X</i>, was applicable

91
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,003
to both the rotation
and translation hand controller.

92
00:05:02,566 --> 00:05:08,650
We'll look now at the translation
hand controller inputs and consequences.

93
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:13,534
Let's suppose that we are here,
looking with the Space Shuttle,

94
00:05:13,534 --> 00:05:16,330
using the Crew Optical Alignment Sight,

95
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:19,162
which is basically a sight
available to the crew

96
00:05:19,162 --> 00:05:22,148
to look into the <i>- Z</i> body axis,

97
00:05:22,148 --> 00:05:24,296
and we look at the payload, which is here,

98
00:05:24,296 --> 00:05:27,329
and we see that the payload is moving
toward the nose of the orbit,

99
00:05:27,329 --> 00:05:30,717
and we want to stabilize it
with respect to the Shuttle orbiter.

100
00:05:30,717 --> 00:05:34,790
So we have
the translation hand controller,

101
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:37,422
that controller which looks
like a mushroom,

102
00:05:37,422 --> 00:05:40,907
and it has been set in the <i>+ X, - X</i> mode,

103
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:46,145
and we take it upwards,
so it's very logical, very intuitive,

104
00:05:46,145 --> 00:05:49,344
and this will fire thrusters
in the back of the orbiter,

105
00:05:49,344 --> 00:05:52,134
and it will make the orbiter
move towards its nose

106
00:05:52,134 --> 00:05:55,828
until, visible from the Crew
Optical Alignment Sight,

107
00:05:55,828 --> 00:05:58,968
payload, which is here, is stabilized

108
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:01,785
with respect to the Crew
Optical Alignment Sight.

109
00:06:01,785 --> 00:06:05,285
So this is the way we operate
the translation hand controller.

110
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:08,396
Rotation hand control
is something similar.

111
00:06:08,396 --> 00:06:13,150
We have the RHC here,
and we give, in this illustration,

112
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:18,311
a roll to the left, or a negative roll,

113
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,756
and this will fire thrusters
in one direction,

114
00:06:21,756 --> 00:06:24,792
in the forward reaction
control system thrusters,

115
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:26,113
and in the other direction

116
00:06:26,113 --> 00:06:29,247
with the aft reaction control
system thrusters.

117
00:06:29,247 --> 00:06:32,466
This will be the consequence
on the payload.

118
00:06:32,466 --> 00:06:36,475
The Shuttle is here, rolling negatively,

119
00:06:36,475 --> 00:06:39,176
which will create
a positive roll of the target

120
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:40,758
versus the Space Shuttle.

121
00:06:40,758 --> 00:06:43,887
That's the use
of the rotational hand controller

122
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:46,599
from the aft flight deck,
as we depicted before.

123
00:06:47,342 --> 00:06:51,094
This is a depiction
of the final approach to the target.

124
00:06:51,686 --> 00:06:56,918
The target, as usual, is represented
as the intersection of the two axes,

125
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:59,374
again, the vertical axis
to the center of the Earth,

126
00:06:59,374 --> 00:07:03,783
and the horizontal axis,
with the velocity vector to the left.

127
00:07:04,403 --> 00:07:07,287
And, as indicated before, we come,

128
00:07:07,287 --> 00:07:10,134
on a typical Shuttle rendezvous,
with either

129
00:07:10,134 --> 00:07:13,710
the International Space Station
or the Hubble Space Telescope,

130
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:16,953
from behind and below,
and we have a certain number

131
00:07:16,953 --> 00:07:18,689
of so-called <i>mid-course corrections</i>:

132
00:07:18,689 --> 00:07:23,465
there was mid-course 1, 2, 3,
and there's another one here,

133
00:07:23,473 --> 00:07:26,849
and it's just an adjustment
of the trajectory-- relative trajectory -

134
00:07:26,849 --> 00:07:30,867
of the Shuttle versus the target
in order to come with a proper velocity,

135
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,081
on one hand, or the proper trajectory.

136
00:07:33,081 --> 00:07:36,574
We have to do braking;
if we do braking then we have

137
00:07:36,574 --> 00:07:39,903
a reaction control system
in the forward and the aft

138
00:07:39,903 --> 00:07:44,063
firing at the proper direction
in order to reduce the range rates.

139
00:07:44,063 --> 00:07:47,738
We'll always want to adjust
the range rate so as to be,

140
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:53,667
as the value depicted here,
a little more than one thousandth

141
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:59,141
of the range in feet,
in feet per second for the range rates.

142
00:07:59,644 --> 00:08:03,513
And we continue the trajectory,
this is all done manually at this point.

143
00:08:04,085 --> 00:08:08,122
We use mainly
the Crew Optical Alignment Sight

144
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:11,573
to see the position of the target
versus the chaser,

145
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:15,868
until we come in a position
that was pretty standard for ISS:

146
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:19,409
about 600 feet below ISS.

147
00:08:20,034 --> 00:08:23,049
Normally, what was done:
after the Columbia accident

148
00:08:23,049 --> 00:08:26,875
there was a hold point
600 feet below the ISS,

149
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,779
and then there was a pitch maneuver
of the Space Shuttle

150
00:08:29,779 --> 00:08:33,425
in order for the crew on board
the International Space Station

151
00:08:33,425 --> 00:08:36,536
to be able to point cameras
toward the Space Shuttle

152
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:40,179
and verify that there was no damage
to the thermal protection system,

153
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:43,872
which, as you know, had caused
the accident of Columbia,

154
00:08:43,872 --> 00:08:47,203
in February, 2003,

155
00:08:47,203 --> 00:08:49,813
because it was undetected damage

156
00:08:49,813 --> 00:08:52,175
to the thermal protection system
during the ascent.

157
00:08:52,175 --> 00:08:55,610
So we wanted to verify,
on the last Shuttle missions,

158
00:08:55,610 --> 00:09:00,142
from about 2005,
until the last one, in 2011,

159
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:02,780
always wanted to verify,
prior to docking a Shuttle

160
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,953
with the International Space Station,

161
00:09:04,953 --> 00:09:08,299
that the thermal protection system
was in good shape for the re-entry.
