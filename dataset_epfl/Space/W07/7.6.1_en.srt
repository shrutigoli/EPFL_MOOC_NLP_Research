1
00:00:05,877 --> 00:00:09,103
The future of space utilization
and exploration,

2
00:00:09,103 --> 00:00:11,413
I should say in fact,
the present and the future,

3
00:00:11,413 --> 00:00:15,354
because space utilization
is being done now extensively

4
00:00:15,354 --> 00:00:17,409
and will continue to be done.

5
00:00:17,409 --> 00:00:20,043
One of the important aspects
of space utilization

6
00:00:20,043 --> 00:00:21,692
is monitoring of the Earth,

7
00:00:21,692 --> 00:00:25,801
measurements of resources
of planet Earth,

8
00:00:26,171 --> 00:00:28,474
and also the monitoring
of weather systems.

9
00:00:28,474 --> 00:00:34,541
As you can see here, you have a typhoon,
a tropical cyclone over the Pacific

10
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:37,477
threatening the Philippines

11
00:00:37,732 --> 00:00:40,116
and you see here
a little bit further south

12
00:00:40,116 --> 00:00:43,122
Java and Singapore at this place,

13
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:46,621
India here and Africa on the far left.

14
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:49,203
But the monitoring of weather system
is very important,

15
00:00:49,203 --> 00:00:53,052
because it allows
a precise weather forecast on one hand

16
00:00:53,312 --> 00:00:55,106
and in the case of...

17
00:00:56,164 --> 00:00:58,877
a phenomenon like a tropical cyclone,

18
00:00:58,877 --> 00:01:03,794
hurricanes in the Atlantic
and typhoons in the Pacific,

19
00:01:03,794 --> 00:01:06,069
you can order evacuations
which are very important

20
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,938
to save lives and property.

21
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,079
Precise navigation system GPS style,
but this is of course

22
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:14,562
another very important utilization
of space.

23
00:01:15,038 --> 00:01:17,218
The GPS system is quite mature.

24
00:01:17,218 --> 00:01:19,761
The Galileo system,
the European equivalent

25
00:01:19,761 --> 00:01:23,481
is in the process of being put in place.

26
00:01:23,481 --> 00:01:27,761
In 2020, we should have
about 30 satellites

27
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:32,126
in the European Galileo system
to provide a precise navigation.

28
00:01:32,535 --> 00:01:36,726
And of course similar system are
existing for Russia, for China

29
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:38,875
and India also to a certain degree,

30
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:42,727
but these systems will continue
to be improved and updated in the future.

31
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,384
A very important part
of utilization of space.

32
00:01:45,956 --> 00:01:49,026
Communication obviously,
is another important part

33
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:50,025
of connected world.

34
00:01:50,025 --> 00:01:53,916
More and more we are tending
towards a connection

35
00:01:54,346 --> 00:01:57,341
of all parts of planet Earth,

36
00:01:57,341 --> 00:02:01,184
using high-speed internet
and voice communication and others

37
00:02:01,184 --> 00:02:04,024
and in fact you have,
I would say three segments.

38
00:02:04,024 --> 00:02:07,025
You have the segment
in the geostationary orbit,

39
00:02:07,025 --> 00:02:09,323
36 thousand kilometers
above the Earth's surface,

40
00:02:09,323 --> 00:02:11,792
a lot of communication satellites
are there.

41
00:02:12,452 --> 00:02:15,129
Then you have more and more utilization

42
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:17,545
of communication satellite
on low Earth orbit,

43
00:02:17,545 --> 00:02:22,786
of course much closer to the Earth
and providing broadband internet

44
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:25,121
at a very high rate.

45
00:02:25,865 --> 00:02:30,172
The third segment, which is becoming
more and more current

46
00:02:30,172 --> 00:02:34,921
is the utilization
of high flying airplanes.

47
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:39,629
They can be solar airplanes
in the stratosphere:

48
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,905
in the high or low stratosphere,

49
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:44,276
providing similar service to the one

50
00:02:44,276 --> 00:02:49,261
of the LEO satellite,
satellite on low Earth orbit

51
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:51,176
but at a lower cost,

52
00:02:51,176 --> 00:02:55,038
and of course you have the mast
on the surface of the Earth.

53
00:02:55,398 --> 00:02:58,987
So the space segment is
basically this segment here

54
00:02:58,987 --> 00:03:02,530
from low Earth orbit
to geostationary orbit,

55
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:06,954
providing communication capabilities
in a connected world.

56
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:12,447
Space solar power is a concept
that exists since decades already,

57
00:03:12,447 --> 00:03:14,267
has never been implemented really,

58
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:17,481
because of the high cost
of access to space,

59
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:20,270
but the day we'll have lower cost
for access to space,

60
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,900
this is a possibility
of generating power in space

61
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,422
using solar radiation
transforming to electrical power

62
00:03:28,422 --> 00:03:33,018
and then beaming down the energy
in the form of microwave for instance,

63
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:36,522
to focus the region
on the Earth's surface.

64
00:03:36,892 --> 00:03:38,033
This is a dream,

65
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:39,513
may become a reality some day.

66
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:41,708
Is not at that time, but I'm pretty sure

67
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:45,208
that it will to a certain degree
be implemented in the future.

68
00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:49,548
The advantage, of course, is
that you have constant solar energy

69
00:03:49,548 --> 00:03:53,144
beaming on this facility
except maybe for some short eclipses,

70
00:03:53,144 --> 00:03:57,947
but basically you have
most of the time power from the--

71
00:03:57,947 --> 00:04:00,425
radiation power from the Sun
that can be used

72
00:04:00,425 --> 00:04:03,254
as opposed to such a facility
on the Earth,

73
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:05,258
where you have day and night
and you have weather

74
00:04:05,258 --> 00:04:10,433
and you have a lot of reason
why the efficiency is not 100 percent.

75
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:13,906
Such a system,
although expensive to put in place,

76
00:04:13,906 --> 00:04:16,363
of course would be much better
in that respect,

77
00:04:16,363 --> 00:04:19,477
you have nearly constant
solar power in space.

78
00:04:20,955 --> 00:04:22,135
As fas as

79
00:04:23,115 --> 00:04:28,016
the astrophysics and exploration
using scientific instruments in space,

80
00:04:28,356 --> 00:04:31,451
the near future, I would say
the near to intermediate future,

81
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:35,090
is dominated
by the James Webb Space Telescope,

82
00:04:35,090 --> 00:04:38,517
sometimes mentioned
as the successor to Hubble,

83
00:04:38,517 --> 00:04:41,086
although of course it will have
much higher capabilities.

84
00:04:41,086 --> 00:04:43,806
It will work in another wavelength range,

85
00:04:43,806 --> 00:04:46,812
the infrared versus the visible,

86
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:51,296
plus little bit of infrared,
little bit of UV

87
00:04:51,296 --> 00:04:53,177
for the Hubble Space Telescope.

88
00:04:53,177 --> 00:04:55,772
The James Webb would be
a really infrared telescope

89
00:04:55,772 --> 00:04:59,583
located quite far from the Earth,
1.5 million kilometers,

90
00:04:59,583 --> 00:05:03,332
so on the L2 Lagrange point
of the Sun Earth system,

91
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:06,738
it's going to be
a very cold instrument about 40 K

92
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:10,531
and we'll be there
to investigate very far away objects

93
00:05:10,531 --> 00:05:14,574
and look in space
as far as we ever can look,

94
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:17,871
look at either exoplanets
or very far away galaxies.

95
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:21,895
It's a joint project of NASA,
the European Space Agency

96
00:05:21,895 --> 00:05:24,184
and the Canadian Space Agency,

97
00:05:24,184 --> 00:05:31,097
launch planned in 2018
with Ariane 5 from French Guiana.

98
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:36,676
NASA is developing
a new capsule for exploration.

99
00:05:36,676 --> 00:05:39,498
Basically this is for the Moon and beyond,

100
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:42,567
for Mars and other destination
in the solar system.

101
00:05:43,178 --> 00:05:46,664
The ORION capsule should carry four people

102
00:05:46,664 --> 00:05:49,521
to far away destinations
beyond the low Earth orbit,

103
00:05:49,521 --> 00:05:53,343
starting 2018, 2019 for the first test,

104
00:05:53,863 --> 00:05:57,808
then it will be using
the SLS Space Launch System rocket

105
00:05:57,808 --> 00:05:59,869
to go to far away destination.

106
00:05:59,869 --> 00:06:01,626
We'll have another video a little later

107
00:06:01,626 --> 00:06:05,201
where we'll detail
the ORION system and the SLS.

108
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:09,493
The rise of commercial space,
you have several commercial companies,

109
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:14,051
that are providing now, and will provide
in the future, space systems.

110
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:17,577
One interesting one is Bigelow Aerospace,

111
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:21,905
which has been developing
over the past few years inflatable modules

112
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:25,488
that can be used for either creating
a small space station

113
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:30,936
which you see on the left-hand side
with two ORION capsules

114
00:06:30,936 --> 00:06:33,967
attached to both sides
of the small space station

115
00:06:33,967 --> 00:06:35,560
with inflatable modules

116
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:39,206
or it can used also for a lunar base

117
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:40,764
as you can see on the right-hand side.

118
00:06:40,764 --> 00:06:44,767
This is for the future,
but commercial space is really rising

119
00:06:44,767 --> 00:06:48,024
as a very capable partner in the future.

120
00:06:49,237 --> 00:06:53,548
We are now at the end of March 2016
and in a few weeks from now

121
00:06:53,548 --> 00:06:56,411
we'll have the first
BIgelow inflatable module,

122
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:58,436
which you see here on this picture,

123
00:06:58,436 --> 00:07:02,936
that will be taken on a Dragon capsule
provided by SpaceX,

124
00:07:03,553 --> 00:07:05,502
taken to the International Space Station,

125
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:09,552
will be docked to ISS and will be tested

126
00:07:09,862 --> 00:07:15,129
as a future possibility of providing space
for either equipment or personnel

127
00:07:15,609 --> 00:07:17,463
on low Earth orbit or beyond.

128
00:07:17,463 --> 00:07:19,659
So the first test
of a Bigelow module will be

129
00:07:20,269 --> 00:07:24,005
some time in April 2016 on ISS.
