1
00:00:06,206 --> 00:00:09,476
Well, here we are, 
we completed the last unit.

2
00:00:10,354 --> 00:00:13,574
We hope that you enjoyed
this last week with us,

3
00:00:13,574 --> 00:00:15,204
thanks for your participation.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:21,300
I'd like you to focus on the concepts
presented in the unit.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:25,230
As always, I insist 
on a good understanding of the concepts,

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,030
and once they are understood,
including their application,

7
00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:31,502
you can take the final test
of the final unit.

8
00:00:32,834 --> 00:00:37,534
And we would like to remind you also, 
the focus on the suborbital space flight

9
00:00:37,534 --> 00:00:40,144
with the interview of Harry van Hulten

10
00:00:40,144 --> 00:00:43,994
experimental test pilot
for XCOR Aerospace.

11
00:00:43,994 --> 00:00:48,314
The XCOR Aerospace 
did a lot of engine testing

12
00:00:48,314 --> 00:00:49,694
in the last few years,

13
00:00:49,694 --> 00:00:52,454
they have really perfectioned
the propulsion system

14
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:54,474
of the Lynx spacecraft,

15
00:00:54,474 --> 00:00:57,244
and they've done also
some aerodynamic testing

16
00:00:57,244 --> 00:01:01,244
but the specific flight in the atmosphere,

17
00:01:01,244 --> 00:01:04,824
and then, all the way to space,
the boundary of space, hundred kilometers,

18
00:01:04,824 --> 00:01:07,834
still, will have to be done
with this test pilot

19
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:12,239
toward the end of 2016,
or the beginning of 2017.

20
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,770
And here, in the background
of this picture,

21
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:20,930
you have a helmet, 
gloves, and boots;

22
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,080
maybe, some of you 
will wear these some day

23
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,930
for high altittude and high speed flight
with an airplane, or going to space,

24
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,619
and I wish that it happens for you.

25
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:32,869
Take care!
