1
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:10,733
We'll cover the subject of robotics
for the Space Shuttle

2
00:00:10,734 --> 00:00:13,899
and for the International
Space Station in this video.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,833
As you know, Canada was
a producer of, as well, the SRMS,

4
00:00:19,834 --> 00:00:22,231
Shuttle Remote Manipulator System,

5
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:28,359
and the SSRMS,
Space Station Robotic Maneuvering System.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,918
Sometimes, we call them Canadarm--

7
00:00:31,943 --> 00:00:34,134
just Canadarm, 
or Canadarm One for the Shuttle

8
00:00:34,135 --> 00:00:37,156
and Canadarm Two
for the International Space Station.

9
00:00:37,157 --> 00:00:41,022
So, this has become really a specialty
of the Canadians,

10
00:00:41,023 --> 00:00:43,894
and these are machines
that have been working extremely well,

11
00:00:44,014 --> 00:00:47,173
are very reliable,
for both Shuttle and Station.

12
00:00:47,174 --> 00:00:51,030
Here, you see an example
of the utilization of Canadarm One.

13
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:54,391
When it's in the rest position,
it's along the...

14
00:00:57,442 --> 00:01:01,441
port seal of the fuselage
of the Space Shuttle.

15
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:06,423
Or, if you look toward the nose,
it's on the left-hand side.

16
00:01:06,424 --> 00:01:08,247
And then it's being deployed.

17
00:01:08,247 --> 00:01:12,717
It has two joints on the shoulder,

18
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:16,413
one joint on the elbow,
and three joints on the wrist,

19
00:01:17,934 --> 00:01:20,055
and as far as the Shuttle is concerned,

20
00:01:20,056 --> 00:01:22,829
that was the same
for the first, second, third,

21
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:24,913
fourth, and fifth servicing mission.

22
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:31,043
This is STS-125, which was the last one,
the fifth one, in May of 2009.

23
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:35,666
We had to come with the Space Shuttle
in a quite precise relative position

24
00:01:35,667 --> 00:01:40,237
to the telescope, and then, 
the robot arm operator, at some point,

25
00:01:40,238 --> 00:01:44,291
was saying, "I can go and get it,"
to the commander flying the Shuttle,

26
00:01:44,292 --> 00:01:48,224
and then it was his task to go
and grapple the telescope.

27
00:01:48,225 --> 00:01:52,438
There were two grapple fixtures,
one here and the other one there,

28
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:54,640
and here the arm 
is not quite ready to grapple,

29
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:58,235
but it's maneuvering towards
a grappling position for the telescope.

30
00:01:58,236 --> 00:02:03,002
Then, the telescope was moved
with the arm, over that platform here

31
00:02:03,003 --> 00:02:06,091
at the back of the payload bay,
which is a rotating platform,

32
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:09,339
and for the following days,
there were spacewalks that were planned,

33
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,232
and we always oriented
toward the front of the payload bay

34
00:02:12,233 --> 00:02:15,649
the area of the telescope where
the intervention was going to take place

35
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:17,524
on a specific spacewalk.

36
00:02:18,125 --> 00:02:20,135
Now, again, for Hubble servicing missions,

37
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:23,192
beyond the task
of grappling the telescope,

38
00:02:23,192 --> 00:02:26,632
installing it on that structure
in the back of the payload bay,

39
00:02:26,632 --> 00:02:32,037
the Shuttle arm was used, or Canadarm
was used for every spacewalk,

40
00:02:32,037 --> 00:02:35,665
to move one of the two
spacewalking crew members

41
00:02:35,669 --> 00:02:38,501
to his or her position of work.

42
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:41,607
This is taken with a fish-eye lens,

43
00:02:41,607 --> 00:02:44,847
so it looks like we are very high
over the Earth's surface.

44
00:02:44,847 --> 00:02:47,075
In fact, we were 600 kilometers.

45
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,323
And the arm seems
a little bit deformed also;

46
00:02:49,324 --> 00:02:52,121
obviously, this section
of the arm is straight.

47
00:02:52,122 --> 00:02:55,016
And you see the telescope
in the back of the payload bay.

48
00:02:56,107 --> 00:02:58,877
This is the SRMS, or the Canadarm.

49
00:02:58,878 --> 00:03:04,934
Again, you have the shoulder,
yaw joints, and the pitch joints.

50
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:09,639
You have two joints for the shoulder.

51
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,521
You have only one joint for the elbow,
pretty much like a human arm,

52
00:03:14,522 --> 00:03:16,548
and you have three joints for the wrist.

53
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:20,380
So, six joints total,
which mean that if you--

54
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:23,300
for the end effector wanted
to come to a certain position,

55
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:28,631
x, y, z in a specific coordinate system
related to the Shuttle payload bay,

56
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:33,374
and with a given orientation--
pitch, yaw, and roll--

57
00:03:33,374 --> 00:03:35,535
then you had a one-to-one correlation

58
00:03:35,536 --> 00:03:37,697
between the six numbers for the joints

59
00:03:37,698 --> 00:03:41,270
and the six numbers for the position
and orientation of the end effector.

60
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:43,766
You had also two cameras.

61
00:03:44,587 --> 00:03:47,587
This is closed-circuit TV--

62
00:03:47,587 --> 00:03:53,315
that's for CCTV on the elbow,
and you had also a camera on the wrist

63
00:03:53,316 --> 00:03:57,540
which was used in order to capture
an object like the Hubble Space Telescope.

64
00:03:57,541 --> 00:04:00,199
You had certain targets
near the grapple fixture

65
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:03,901
attached to the system to be captured,

66
00:04:03,902 --> 00:04:06,508
and you were looking at that target
with the camera,

67
00:04:06,509 --> 00:04:07,950
and you could position the arm

68
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:11,546
on the basis of the view
from that wrist camera.

69
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:18,100
Now, the SSRMS, or the Canadarm Two
is different from the SRMS

70
00:04:18,101 --> 00:04:20,795
in the sense that we have
a perfectly symmetric arm.

71
00:04:20,796 --> 00:04:24,373
This cluster and this cluster,
are exactly the same.

72
00:04:24,374 --> 00:04:28,359
And we have three joints
at each end, which is six,

73
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,999
plus the elbow joint
which is one degree of freedom,

74
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,730
so we have a grand total of seven joints,

75
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:37,855
and of course,
this configuration was chosen

76
00:04:37,856 --> 00:04:41,728
so that any end can become
the anchor point of the arm,

77
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:47,097
and the other end is becoming
the end effector, or vice versa.

78
00:04:47,098 --> 00:04:51,763
The arm can "walk",
in a way, like a caterpillar,

79
00:04:51,764 --> 00:04:54,077
from one anchor point to the other one,

80
00:04:54,078 --> 00:04:57,625
using this totally symmetric
capability of the arm.

81
00:04:57,626 --> 00:04:59,454
Both ends are exactly the same.

82
00:05:00,913 --> 00:05:03,746
We have a view of Canadarm 2, again,

83
00:05:03,747 --> 00:05:06,580
with the two ends
which are exactly symmetric.

84
00:05:06,581 --> 00:05:08,791
We had a few more cameras
on the Canadarm 2.

85
00:05:08,792 --> 00:05:14,254
We have a camera at one end,

86
00:05:14,254 --> 00:05:16,906
and a camera at the other end,

87
00:05:16,907 --> 00:05:22,600
and we had extra cameras
on each of the branches of the Canadarm,

88
00:05:22,601 --> 00:05:25,330
so we had a grand total of four cameras.

89
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:30,501
The fact that we had more joints than
degrees of freedom was an advantage,

90
00:05:30,518 --> 00:05:32,966
because we could modify
the geometry of the arm

91
00:05:32,967 --> 00:05:34,765
to go from one place to the other.

92
00:05:35,246 --> 00:05:37,633
We could do a so-called pitch-plane change

93
00:05:38,224 --> 00:05:40,977
in order to avoid hitting structures.

94
00:05:40,978 --> 00:05:43,801
So, there's more flexibility,
but also, to a certain degree,

95
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:46,731
more operational challenge
for the operator of the arm.

96
00:05:48,152 --> 00:05:52,339
The end effector or free end
of the Canadarm 2, of course,

97
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:56,240
is exactly the same, as I mentioned
before, as the anchor point.

98
00:05:56,241 --> 00:05:58,898
But it differs from the end effector

99
00:05:58,898 --> 00:06:02,834
of the Canadarm
or the Shuttle robotic arm

100
00:06:02,835 --> 00:06:06,905
in the sense that you have 
these four features that allowed

101
00:06:06,905 --> 00:06:13,482
the anchoring of the end of the SSRMS

102
00:06:13,482 --> 00:06:15,661
that was going to be 
attached to structure.

103
00:06:15,661 --> 00:06:20,897
Of course, this was not applicable
for the Shuttle robotic arm.

104
00:06:20,898 --> 00:06:25,433
On several steps of the assembly
of the International Space Station,

105
00:06:25,434 --> 00:06:29,520
we had one piece of equipment--
and here, it's this piece of equipment--

106
00:06:29,521 --> 00:06:31,962
that was taken out
of the payload bay of the Shuttle

107
00:06:32,082 --> 00:06:34,541
using the Shuttle robotic arm,

108
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:39,404
then it was handed off
to the Station robotic arm, which is here.

109
00:06:39,405 --> 00:06:44,168
So, a hand-off operation
was quite a common operation in robotics,

110
00:06:44,169 --> 00:06:45,775
during Space Station assembly.

111
00:06:47,193 --> 00:06:50,959
On this picture, you see
the bottom part of the SSRMS

112
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,702
attached to structure here,

113
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:57,754
with these four capture features
surrounding the end effector,

114
00:06:57,755 --> 00:07:01,376
and you have another beast here,
also provided by the Canadians,

115
00:07:01,377 --> 00:07:05,621
the so-called Special Purpose
Dextrous Manipulator, or SPDM.

116
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:12,416
And the Station arm
could grab the end of this SPDM,

117
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:19,468
and then the SPDM itself was equipped
with a few special arms,

118
00:07:19,469 --> 00:07:22,883
which allowed it to perform
very precise tasks.

119
00:07:22,884 --> 00:07:27,089
Obviously, the end effector of the SSRMS
could not do a very precise task,

120
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:29,543
but adding to it the SPDM

121
00:07:29,544 --> 00:07:34,052
would allow the performance
of a detailed or precise task.

122
00:07:35,656 --> 00:07:38,422
Again, on the subject
of the end effector grapple fixture,

123
00:07:38,423 --> 00:07:42,700
you have here, obviously,
the end effector of the SSRMS.

124
00:07:42,701 --> 00:07:46,247
You see the feature allowing
the anchoring of the end

125
00:07:46,248 --> 00:07:48,970
of the arm attached to structure,

126
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:53,091
and in this picture,
it's going towards a grapple fixture.

127
00:07:54,872 --> 00:07:58,032
Here, this is probably
the grapple fixture of the SPDM.

128
00:07:58,033 --> 00:08:00,719
And you have a camera here,
looking at the target,

129
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:04,848
which is very close
to the grapple fixture of the target,

130
00:08:04,849 --> 00:08:08,749
and you are guided,
as the arm operator's doing this manually,

131
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,526
this is not an automatic operation,
but you do this manually--

132
00:08:11,526 --> 00:08:15,063
you are guided by the view
from the camera, to give you cues

133
00:08:15,063 --> 00:08:17,697
about the proper orientation
of the end effector

134
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:20,515
versus grapple fixture,
and also the distance.

135
00:08:20,515 --> 00:08:24,069
All of these cues are visible
on the picture that you have on monitor,

136
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,543
or on several monitors.

137
00:08:25,544 --> 00:08:28,980
Of course, there's a lot of training
behind that, but it works fine.

138
00:08:28,981 --> 00:08:30,674
It has been very reliable.

139
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:34,207
For the control of the arm, you select
the mode, the mode of operation.

140
00:08:34,207 --> 00:08:36,313
For instance, you have
the end effector mode,

141
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:40,817
where you control the arm as if
you were sitting at the end of the arm,

142
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:46,807
looking in the direction of the axis
of the cylinder of the end effector.

143
00:08:49,308 --> 00:08:53,089
This is a mode that is used if you do
a capture of a free-flying target,

144
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:57,519
for instance, and as mentioned before,
you have a rotation hand controller

145
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:00,439
for the control of the arm,
and a translation hand controller,

146
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:03,568
exactly the same features as you have
for the control of the Shuttle itself.

147
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,946
And here you have the coordinate system

148
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:10,839
attached to the end effector of the SSRMS.

149
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:14,713
You can imagine, if you push towards <i>x</i>,

150
00:09:14,713 --> 00:09:19,435
or you push on the little button
of the translation hand controller,

151
00:09:19,436 --> 00:09:22,047
then you are going to move the arm
in the <i>x</i> direction.

152
00:09:22,048 --> 00:09:26,769
If you look at the target
using a camera, here,

153
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:29,406
then it's something
that is very intuitive:

154
00:09:29,407 --> 00:09:33,198
you're going to be moving towards
the grapple fixture of the target.

155
00:09:33,729 --> 00:09:36,748
and if you want to do a <i>y</i>-translation,

156
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:39,613
you move the translation
hand controller in this direction,

157
00:09:39,614 --> 00:09:42,993
then you are going to have a motion
of the arm in this particular direction.

158
00:09:42,994 --> 00:09:45,307
Which, again, is going
to be perfectly intuitive.

159
00:09:45,308 --> 00:09:46,924
And the same for the rotations.

160
00:09:46,925 --> 00:09:49,530
They have to be intuitive,
you have to choose a mode

161
00:09:49,531 --> 00:09:53,329
so that you can accomplish
the planned task, on one hand;

162
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,831
on the other hand,
it has to be quite intuitive.

163
00:09:57,482 --> 00:10:00,656
Well, we had, before,
the two teams spacewalking,

164
00:10:00,657 --> 00:10:02,402
and now we have the two Mikes.

165
00:10:02,403 --> 00:10:05,651
Mike Fincke on the right hand side,

166
00:10:05,652 --> 00:10:08,552
and Mike Foale
on the left-hand side, watching.

167
00:10:08,553 --> 00:10:13,549
Mike Fincke is at the control station
for the Space Station robotic arm,

168
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,108
and as mentioned before,

169
00:10:15,108 --> 00:10:19,046
he has on his right hand
the rotation hand controller for the arm,

170
00:10:19,047 --> 00:10:22,107
on his left hand, 
the translation hand controller.

171
00:10:22,108 --> 00:10:26,905
And he has a special computer
dedicated to the operation of the arm,

172
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:28,281
with a special display,

173
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:33,088
and he has also different monitors
showing views from different cameras.

174
00:10:33,089 --> 00:10:37,820
But that's the way 
the SSRMS is still being operated.

175
00:10:37,821 --> 00:10:39,353
For the Shuttle, it was similar,

176
00:10:39,354 --> 00:10:42,608
in terms of rotation hand controller
and translation hand controller.

177
00:10:42,608 --> 00:10:47,195
Of course, we had a direct view
out of the aft windows of the flight deck,

178
00:10:47,195 --> 00:10:48,872
of the operation of the arm,

179
00:10:48,872 --> 00:10:53,629
because the anchor point of the arm,
or the shoulder, was very close,

180
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:56,460
finally, to the forward portion
of the payload bay,

181
00:10:56,461 --> 00:11:01,063
and close to the position itself
of the robotic arm operator.

182
00:11:01,064 --> 00:11:04,366
In a way, it was easier for the Shuttle,
because we had a direct view.

183
00:11:04,366 --> 00:11:08,506
In the case of the Station,
before the Cupola was installed,

184
00:11:08,506 --> 00:11:11,917
there was never a direct view,
and now, with the Cupola installed,

185
00:11:11,917 --> 00:11:15,777
there's at least a partial view
of the arm, seen from the Cupola,

186
00:11:15,778 --> 00:11:18,672
where a very similar station
as the one we see here

187
00:11:18,673 --> 00:11:20,533
is installed now in the cupola.

188
00:11:22,117 --> 00:11:26,485
Well, this is a view of Stephen Robinson,
a NASA astronaut, riding the Canadarm 2

189
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:29,388
on the small platform 
at the end of the arm.

190
00:11:29,389 --> 00:11:36,316
Quite a nice view, showing the end part
of the Space Station robotic arm,

191
00:11:36,316 --> 00:11:38,028
or Canadarm 2,

192
00:11:38,028 --> 00:11:40,603
and Stephen Robinson

193
00:11:40,603 --> 00:11:43,425
with a beautiful view of the background.

194
00:11:43,426 --> 00:11:46,028
Now, this is in a way a symbolic picture,

195
00:11:46,029 --> 00:11:51,308
showing that, as well, robotics 
and spacewalking has been used extensively

196
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:55,212
for the Space Station assembly
and for the Space Station maintenance,

197
00:11:55,213 --> 00:11:57,580
and the combination of the two has been

198
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,411
an absolutely essential tool for Hubble,

199
00:11:59,412 --> 00:12:01,610
and for the International Space Station.
