Well, here we are, we completed the last unit.
We hope that you enjoyed this last week with us, thanks for your participation.
I'd like you to focus on the concepts presented in the unit.
As always, I insist on a good understanding of the concepts, and once they are understood, including their application, you can take the final test of the final unit.
And we would like to remind you also, the focus on the suborbital space flight with the interview of Harry van Hulten experimental test pilot for XCOR Aerospace.
The XCOR Aerospace did a lot of engine testing in the last few years, they have really perfectioned the propulsion system of the Lynx spacecraft, and they've done also some aerodynamic testing but the specific flight in the atmosphere, and then, all the way to space, the boundary of space, hundred kilometers, still, will have to be done with this test pilot toward the end of 2016, or the beginning of 2017.
And here, in the background of this picture, you have a helmet, gloves, and boots; maybe, some of you will wear these some day for high altittude and high speed flight with an airplane, or going to space, and I wish that it happens for you.
Take care!
