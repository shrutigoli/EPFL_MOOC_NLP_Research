Hello everyone, and welcome to unit 7 of the course.
We will cover selected topics on human space flight.
As well as the future of space exploration.
The subject will be 7.2, extra vehicular or space walk.
7.3, space robotics for the space shuttle and the international space station.
7.4 will be about astronaut training, including training for spacewalks in a water environment to simulate a world without gravity.
7.5 will be about sub orbital flights basically going up and down, reaching a maximum altitude of at least 100 kilometers.
The upper part of the trajectory being at free fall and consequently in  (INAUDIBLE) conditions.
7.6 will cover the future of space utilization and exploration, manned and unmanned.
We have prepared some practice quizzes after each video as usual to make sure that you have understood the relevant concepts.
Each section from 7.2 to 7.6 is concluded again by a controlled quiz.
In addition, there's a test at the end of the unit.
To illustrate the unit, we have prepared a focus on commercial suborbital space flight, with an interview of Harry van Hulten experimental test pilot for the XCOR Aerospace Company.
He has a responsibility of conducting test flights of the Lynx space plane prior to its operation and commercial utilization.
Well this is it. Enjoy this last unit of the course.
This is a real astronaut's unit.
Take care.
