1
00:00:05,317 --> 00:00:06,617
Well, it's time to conclude

2
00:00:06,617 --> 00:00:09,267
after several months 
of preparation and execution

3
00:00:09,267 --> 00:00:13,011
of the more than 15 hours 
of recording of the MOOC.

4
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:16,305
I would like to express my gratitude
to several organizations

5
00:00:16,306 --> 00:00:18,422
and key people who made this possible.

6
00:00:19,293 --> 00:00:22,978
First of all, let me mention
the Swiss Space Center,

7
00:00:22,978 --> 00:00:26,750
and, in particular, 
the Director of the Swiss Space Center

8
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:28,748
Professor Volker Gass,

9
00:00:28,749 --> 00:00:32,954
who suggested the idea
of having my course put on MOOC,

10
00:00:32,955 --> 00:00:34,917
more than a year ago.

11
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:37,877
And this is where we are located
in Switzerland,

12
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:40,708
this is Lausanne, in Switzerland,

13
00:00:40,709 --> 00:00:42,750
a medium-size town,

14
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,750
this is Lake Leman, or Lake Geneva,

15
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:50,057
and at the end of the yellow arrow
you have EPFL,

16
00:00:50,175 --> 00:00:53,851
the Federal Institute of Technology
in Lausanne, Switzerland,

17
00:00:53,852 --> 00:00:57,507
and the Swiss Space Center
hosted within EPFL.

18
00:00:57,508 --> 00:00:59,518
And, of course, 
you have the Space Shuttle,

19
00:00:59,638 --> 00:01:02,615
overflying nearly the Swiss Space Center,

20
00:01:02,616 --> 00:01:05,123
just missed it by few tens of miles.

21
00:01:05,125 --> 00:01:08,894
This was on a STS-114 mission

22
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:12,375
in the summer of 2005.

23
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:16,082
The flight was commanded
by Eileen Collins, a woman commander,

24
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:19,331
and again, she tried to come over
the Swiss Space Center,

25
00:01:19,332 --> 00:01:20,969
and missed it by a few miles.

26
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,293
The Shuttle is just over
the Jura Mountains

27
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:24,996
which are north of Lausanne,

28
00:01:24,997 --> 00:01:27,334
and this is the Lake Neuchatel,

29
00:01:27,352 --> 00:01:31,337
in the north part
of French-speaking part of Switzerland.

30
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:37,160
Now, we have two absolutely key people
for the success of this MOOC:

31
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,236
Lise-Loup and Julien.

32
00:01:39,237 --> 00:01:41,225
Lise-Loup was in command

33
00:01:41,226 --> 00:01:44,544
of the whole preparation
and execution of the MOOC,

34
00:01:44,545 --> 00:01:47,075
she was the manager of the whole project.

35
00:01:47,076 --> 00:01:51,780
It was a full-time job
for six months, or even more.

36
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:54,900
Thanks, Lise-Loup, for a wonderful job!

37
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:58,952
And Julien, at the same time as
he was preparing

38
00:01:58,952 --> 00:02:03,412
for his master level exams at EPFL,
and passing these exams.

39
00:02:04,053 --> 00:02:07,402
He worked a lot on the specific videos;

40
00:02:07,403 --> 00:02:11,860
we prepared together the videos
and he did most of the graphics,

41
00:02:11,861 --> 00:02:14,776
the selection of the pictures;
thanks, Julien.

42
00:02:14,776 --> 00:02:18,622
So, Lise-Loup and Julien
are absolutely key people

43
00:02:18,623 --> 00:02:20,678
for the success of this MOOC.

44
00:02:20,679 --> 00:02:23,443
For me, a little bit more in the shadow,
but extremely important,

45
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:26,959
were Camille and Thibault,
two PhD students at EPFL,

46
00:02:26,961 --> 00:02:31,145
and they are the ones
who did all the quizzes and the tests.

47
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:33,870
They proposed the questions,

48
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:35,975
although we worked together
on these sometimes,

49
00:02:35,975 --> 00:02:38,106
and they gave all the answers.

50
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:41,179
So my hat is down to Camille and Thibault.

51
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:44,994
They put a lot of work on this
on parallel with the PhD work

52
00:02:44,995 --> 00:02:47,007
here at EPFL.

53
00:02:47,008 --> 00:02:50,726
We hope that everything went well
with the quizzes and the tests,

54
00:02:50,727 --> 00:02:54,956
for whatever went well was thank
to Camille and Thibault;

55
00:02:54,957 --> 00:02:57,704
if there were any problems
with the quizzes and tests,

56
00:02:57,704 --> 00:02:59,533
it was my fault, sorry.

57
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:04,737
Another key person was Matthew,
the video editor,

58
00:03:04,738 --> 00:03:09,400
here at the MOOC
recording station at EPFL.

59
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:13,427
And here you see Matthew,
together with Lise-Loup,

60
00:03:13,428 --> 00:03:16,571
who, by the way, in addition
to managing the whole project

61
00:03:16,584 --> 00:03:18,502
did all the interviews, a lot of work,

62
00:03:18,503 --> 00:03:21,555
a lot of preparation
for the interviews themselves.

63
00:03:21,556 --> 00:03:23,914
And she ran the interviews herself.

64
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:30,416
And this is the whole EPFL MOOC team
except Thibault who I mentioned before,

65
00:03:30,417 --> 00:03:33,657
and Gilles, the recording studio technician.

66
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:38,109
This is in the studio itself--
you see the recording table here,

67
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,221
where most of the work was done.

68
00:03:41,392 --> 00:03:43,999
And obviously, all of this
would not have been possible

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,083
without the support of the edX team,

70
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:49,014
so thanks a lot to all these people
who work at edX,

71
00:03:49,015 --> 00:03:51,148
or wherever they are in the world.

72
00:03:51,149 --> 00:03:54,815
Last but not least, thanks to all
the learners, the students,

73
00:03:54,816 --> 00:03:57,258
the MOOC students, for your participation.

74
00:03:57,259 --> 00:04:01,959
From all over the world, we had
nearly 7,000 participants,

75
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:07,590
and wherever you see a light
on this map of planet Earth

76
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:08,840
during the night,

77
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:13,341
you have people and you have
students of this MOOC.

78
00:04:13,342 --> 00:04:15,567
And this is your teacher, Claude,

79
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:17,122
and I had a few bad days in my life,

80
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:19,582
not too many, fortunately, 
but I had a few,

81
00:04:19,582 --> 00:04:23,647
and this is not a really bad day,
but this is a potentially bad day

82
00:04:23,648 --> 00:04:26,556
during the preparation for STS-46,

83
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:29,159
the first flight
of the Tethered Satellite;

84
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,923
you see the crew here, in the studio,
at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,

85
00:04:32,924 --> 00:04:35,249
with the Commander Lauren Shriver,

86
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,408
and we had real concerns about
the behavior of the Tethered in space.

87
00:04:38,408 --> 00:04:40,830
When you have an object
like a spacecraft,

88
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:43,434
the station or Shuttle, or Soyuz,

89
00:04:43,435 --> 00:04:46,255
it's pretty solid and it behaves
in a predictable way,

90
00:04:46,256 --> 00:04:50,416
but we didn't know how the tether
would behave during this mission,

91
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:52,031
especially in the case
of the tether cut,

92
00:04:52,031 --> 00:04:55,454
so in the studio, we played the scenario
where the tether breaks,

93
00:04:55,454 --> 00:04:58,643
and then the crew gets a really bad day,
including myself.

94
00:05:00,179 --> 00:05:02,480
But I had a lot of good days
also in my life.

95
00:05:02,481 --> 00:05:05,640
And many, many good days
were when I was flying

96
00:05:05,641 --> 00:05:08,043
in the Swiss Airforce Hawker Hunter.

97
00:05:09,428 --> 00:05:13,754
This is the handle for commanding
the ejection seat.

98
00:05:13,755 --> 00:05:17,885
I never had to use it in my life--
fortunately, thanks God--

99
00:05:18,446 --> 00:05:22,278
it means that I had many landings
as I had take offs,

100
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:24,667
so I flew the Hawker Hunter
a lot of good days.

101
00:05:25,338 --> 00:05:28,885
I must say I had also
a lot of good days during this MOOC,

102
00:05:28,886 --> 00:05:35,021
and together with a bunch
of very talented people, and good people,

103
00:05:35,022 --> 00:05:37,783
and doing this MOOC was
a big pleasure in my life,

104
00:05:37,784 --> 00:05:39,383
and a lot of good days.

105
00:05:39,954 --> 00:05:42,204
Well, this is going to be a brief summary

106
00:05:42,205 --> 00:05:44,244
of the main subjects
covered in the course.

107
00:05:44,245 --> 00:05:48,763
Of course, I won't cover everything,
you can look again at the videos

108
00:05:48,764 --> 00:05:51,757
if you want to refresh your memory
on some aspects of the course,

109
00:05:51,757 --> 00:05:56,279
but I go quickly through the key subjects
that were covered.

110
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:00,036
After the review of the laws of mechanics,

111
00:06:00,037 --> 00:06:04,586
we talked about the transition
from atmosphere to space,

112
00:06:04,587 --> 00:06:06,659
you remember that is a slow transition,

113
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:10,623
there is a boundary,
a so-called Karman line at 100 km,

114
00:06:10,624 --> 00:06:15,932
which delineates the realm
of the aeronautics

115
00:06:15,933 --> 00:06:19,446
below 100 kilometers,
and astronautics, above.

116
00:06:19,447 --> 00:06:22,923
But, as you know, also above 100 km,
you still have a lot of particles,

117
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,522
and a lot of breaking 
for low-Earth orbit satellites,

118
00:06:26,523 --> 00:06:28,584
which have a limited life time.

119
00:06:29,295 --> 00:06:31,804
We went to talk about gravitational wells,

120
00:06:31,805 --> 00:06:35,422
and I took the definition
of the gravitational well

121
00:06:35,423 --> 00:06:38,249
that is given in Arthur Clarke's book.

122
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:43,168
And you remember that the depth
of the gravitational well of the Earth

123
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:44,583
is a radius of the Earth,

124
00:06:44,584 --> 00:06:47,278
and that all of the gravitational wells
of all the other celestial bodies,

125
00:06:47,278 --> 00:06:51,468
whether they are big and massive,
or small and light mass,

126
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:55,584
are refered to this depth
of the gravitational well of the Earth

127
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:57,265
equal to its radius.

128
00:06:57,266 --> 00:07:00,004
And you see on the left-hand side

129
00:07:00,004 --> 00:07:02,607
a very, very shallow
gravitational well of the Moon

130
00:07:02,607 --> 00:07:05,424
that has a shot 
of about 400 km.

131
00:07:05,935 --> 00:07:08,665
So, try to keep that concept
in your mind,

132
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,563
is a very useful concept
to imagine the energy

133
00:07:11,563 --> 00:07:15,108
needed to come out 
of the gravitational influence

134
00:07:15,108 --> 00:07:17,830
of various celestial bodies,
in the Solar System or beyond.

135
00:07:19,061 --> 00:07:20,966
Then we went to talk about orbits,

136
00:07:20,967 --> 00:07:27,372
the Kepler’s laws and elliptical orbits,
and other shapes.

137
00:07:27,372 --> 00:07:30,634
We talked about Hohmann transfer,

138
00:07:30,635 --> 00:07:33,146
how to go from one circular
 orbit to another one,

139
00:07:33,147 --> 00:07:36,045
whether it's to a larger orbit
or to a smaller orbit.

140
00:07:36,046 --> 00:07:38,626
We went then to talk 
about special orbits,

141
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:40,795
that are really used a lot

142
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:44,715
in the practical exploitation 
of the space,

143
00:07:44,715 --> 00:07:48,444
typically, the geostationary orbits
on the Equator,

144
00:07:48,445 --> 00:07:51,230
46,000 km away from the Earth surface;

145
00:07:51,231 --> 00:07:54,666
circular orbits, used for communication.

146
00:07:54,667 --> 00:07:57,750
We talked about Sun-sychronous orbits,

147
00:07:57,751 --> 00:08:01,041
we discussed the subject
of nodal regression

148
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:03,960
which allows the sun synchronous orbits,

149
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:09,956
and at the end of this unit,
we talked about the Lagrange points;

150
00:08:09,957 --> 00:08:13,182
L1, L2, L3, L4, L5.

151
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:16,449
You remember that we have L3,

152
00:08:16,459 --> 00:08:22,168
which is a little bit
beyond the orbit of the Earth.

153
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:27,425
We have L1 and L2, which are
1.5 million km away from the Earth

154
00:08:27,426 --> 00:08:30,879
in the respectively Sun direction,
anti-Sun direction;

155
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:34,245
and L4, L5 are making

156
00:08:34,245 --> 00:08:38,534
equilateral triangles
with two main bodies

157
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:40,336
which are the Sun and the Earth.

158
00:08:40,337 --> 00:08:42,524
We covered then the subject
of the rendezvous.

159
00:08:42,525 --> 00:08:45,781
In order to avoid having
too much mathematics

160
00:08:45,781 --> 00:08:48,689
and complex equations
to do the calculation,

161
00:08:48,809 --> 00:08:51,700
I derived some simplified expressions,

162
00:08:51,701 --> 00:08:56,336
typically if you are at a certain distance
below as a chaser,

163
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:57,773
below the orbit of the target,

164
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:02,625
then you move towards the target
and below the orbit of the target,

165
00:09:02,626 --> 00:09:03,814
at a certain rate,

166
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:08,335
and derived some linear expressions
in order to make the calculations easier.

167
00:09:09,417 --> 00:09:13,496
But the main purpose was really

168
00:09:13,496 --> 00:09:16,789
to understand this relative orbit

169
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:20,412
of the chaser of the target,
which are kind of loops,

170
00:09:20,413 --> 00:09:23,278
and when you are right here,
relatively close to the target,

171
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:28,482
which is here, in the center
of the coordinate system

172
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:33,213
which is a reference coordinate system
for the motion of the chaser

173
00:09:33,214 --> 00:09:34,963
versus a target.

174
00:09:34,964 --> 00:09:37,797
At this point, you need to increase
the energy of your orbit

175
00:09:37,798 --> 00:09:40,526
so that after one full orbit
and an hour and a half later,

176
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,946
you can be in the vicinity of the target,

177
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:46,105
A pretty big subject was of course
the interplanetary trajectories.

178
00:09:46,225 --> 00:09:49,417
You remember we divided these
in thee parts.

179
00:09:49,419 --> 00:09:51,955
We have what's happening
in the vicinity of the Earth,

180
00:09:51,956 --> 00:09:54,079
inside the sphere
of influence of the Earth.

181
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:56,417
Then we shrunk this to this point,

182
00:09:56,444 --> 00:09:58,999
then we have a heliocentric trajectory

183
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,664
taking us pretty much
a Hohmann transfer taking us

184
00:10:02,665 --> 00:10:05,875
towards the target planet, which is here.

185
00:10:05,876 --> 00:10:07,987
Then we looked at what’s happening

186
00:10:07,987 --> 00:10:09,856
within the sphere
of influence of the target

187
00:10:09,856 --> 00:10:14,418
so we divided this kind of trajectory
in three steps to make it easier

188
00:10:14,419 --> 00:10:18,040
for calculation, and we get
pretty precise results this way.

189
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,746
Propulsion and attitude control:

190
00:10:19,747 --> 00:10:22,762
we looked at what's happening here
in the bottom of Soyuz rocket

191
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:24,179
going to space.

192
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:28,360
Remember the important concept
of specific impulse,

193
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:32,312
and the relationship
with exhaust velocity of the thruster;

194
00:10:32,313 --> 00:10:35,984
then altitude control, this is
for the Mercury spacecraft.

195
00:10:36,284 --> 00:10:38,938
We have a pitch, yaw, and roll,

196
00:10:38,939 --> 00:10:42,259
and we looked at some details
of the attitude control,

197
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:45,074
the Shuttle, using
the rotation hand controller,

198
00:10:45,075 --> 00:10:49,800
and you have the applicable illustration
on the upper right.

199
00:10:50,321 --> 00:10:53,173
At the end we covered
some special subjects

200
00:10:53,954 --> 00:10:57,480
and, in particular, we covered
the tethered satellites,

201
00:10:57,501 --> 00:11:00,277
which is something
that I had the privilege of experiencing

202
00:11:00,278 --> 00:11:02,943
with my fellow crew members
on two occasions.

203
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:09,416
In 1992, STS-46, and 1996, STS-75,

204
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,137
with some success,

205
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,109
especially on the second mission.

206
00:11:14,085 --> 00:11:17,584
I talked about quite a lot of details
on tethered satellites,

207
00:11:17,584 --> 00:11:19,591
because I think
it's an interesting application

208
00:11:19,591 --> 00:11:22,386
of the laws of mechanics
and electrodynamics in space,

209
00:11:23,037 --> 00:11:25,896
and it's quite a rich field
which is not ended.

210
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:29,209
I'm sure that there will be 
such applications in the future.

211
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:33,481
I talked about the Space Shuttle,
the International Space Station.

212
00:11:33,601 --> 00:11:36,904
On the upper right, you have Ariane 6,

213
00:11:38,645 --> 00:11:42,329
which was a new launch developed
by the European Space Agency

214
00:11:42,329 --> 00:11:44,841
and it should be operational
in a few years from now.

215
00:11:44,841 --> 00:11:47,629
In the bottom right, we talked
about Orion,

216
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,695
and beyond the lower orbit,
the capsule vehicle,

217
00:11:52,696 --> 00:11:56,105
that it developed by NASA
and the aerospace industry in the US.

218
00:11:57,656 --> 00:12:00,036
Well, I asked you to remember
the concepts: you remember,

219
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:02,074
this course is mainly a concept course,

220
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:06,875
I'd like you to really, really have
these concepts pretty solid in your mind.

221
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:12,614
This is a basic--it's not a course
that goes very deep into space technology,

222
00:12:12,614 --> 00:12:17,062
it's a mission-designed course,
and not a spacecraft-designed course,

223
00:12:17,063 --> 00:12:20,324
but the concepts, I'd like you
to keep them in your mind, pretty solid.

224
00:12:21,635 --> 00:12:24,082
You may want to become
an astronaut also.

225
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:27,322
I was very happy to be one,
and very privileged;

226
00:12:27,322 --> 00:12:30,120
I felt privileged to be able to go
into space on a few occasions,

227
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,978
four times in the 90s.

228
00:12:32,549 --> 00:12:36,159
We have a new selection now,
in the United States,

229
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,842
the so-called class of 2017.

230
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:44,378
it's going to be the group number 22
of the US astronauts.

231
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:49,155
This application is very popular,

232
00:12:49,156 --> 00:12:54,574
and we had so far, 18,300 applicants
for this application,

233
00:12:55,474 --> 00:12:58,374
so if you are a candidate
for this application,

234
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:01,500
obviously you are not alone,
but at the same, is very rejoicing

235
00:13:01,539 --> 00:13:03,979
because iе means that space
is extremely popular,

236
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:07,293
and I think that the perspective
of going to the Moon,

237
00:13:07,336 --> 00:13:10,440
and going to Mars,
and other objects in the Solar System

238
00:13:10,441 --> 00:13:11,813
is very attractive,

239
00:13:11,814 --> 00:13:13,748
and by all means, sign up,

240
00:13:13,749 --> 00:13:16,718
and if you are elsewhere than in the US,
if you are in Russia,

241
00:13:16,719 --> 00:13:20,070
in China, in India, in Europe,

242
00:13:20,071 --> 00:13:23,287
sign up for any astronaut selection
in the future,

243
00:13:23,288 --> 00:13:25,617
near future or far-away future.

244
00:13:26,648 --> 00:13:30,273
You can be sure
that there will always be work to do

245
00:13:30,274 --> 00:13:33,968
in the low Earth orbit
for astronauts and cosmonauts

246
00:13:33,969 --> 00:13:36,966
and the International Space Station
should be operational

247
00:13:36,967 --> 00:13:39,032
until, at least, 2024.

248
00:13:39,042 --> 00:13:41,518
And beyond the ISS, it's possible

249
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:46,367
that we'll have
other low Earth orbit stations

250
00:13:46,368 --> 00:13:47,999
that are not conceived yet,

251
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,249
but I am pretty sure
that we will always exploit

252
00:13:50,369 --> 00:13:53,635
the capabilities, and the observations,
and the possibilities

253
00:13:53,636 --> 00:13:55,335
of the low Earth orbits.

254
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,166
On the left-hand side,

255
00:13:57,167 --> 00:14:00,875
you have Tim Peake,
the British ESA astronaut

256
00:14:00,876 --> 00:14:04,126
training on the robotic workstation
in the US Lab.

257
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:07,176
And you see him coming out
of the airlock of ISS

258
00:14:07,177 --> 00:14:08,815
on the upper right,

259
00:14:08,816 --> 00:14:13,277
and during his spacewalk,
in the lower right.

260
00:14:14,168 --> 00:14:17,415
ISS is a very productive
and good environment

261
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,331
for doing research in space.

262
00:14:19,334 --> 00:14:23,875
And a lot of the research is related
to capabilities for humans

263
00:14:23,876 --> 00:14:28,958
to go beyond the low Earth orbits
in the next years, or the next decades.

264
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,376
And one very positive sign

265
00:14:31,417 --> 00:14:34,626
was that plants are growing
reasonably well in weightlessness

266
00:14:34,626 --> 00:14:39,166
and we even had recently a flower
blooming in the ISS.

267
00:14:40,367 --> 00:14:43,236
The views of the Earth from
the low Earth orbit

268
00:14:43,237 --> 00:14:44,825
are always very spectacular.

269
00:14:44,826 --> 00:14:48,032
We have a lot of time lapse videos
that have been published recently

270
00:14:48,152 --> 00:14:53,153
by various astronauts, US,
Russian, and from other nations.

271
00:14:53,154 --> 00:14:57,383
And all these pictures, and videos
are really, really spectacular.

272
00:14:57,384 --> 00:14:59,743
This is a nice view 
that was published recently,

273
00:14:59,744 --> 00:15:02,149
we are now at the end of March, 2016,

274
00:15:03,417 --> 00:15:05,486
from ISS, the Mediterranean Sea,

275
00:15:05,486 --> 00:15:11,459
and Cairo, from the Station,
you see here, Cairo,

276
00:15:11,501 --> 00:15:13,458
and the Delta of the Nile,

277
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:16,327
you have Israel,
and the Mediterranean Sea

278
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:22,182
with low clouds and the Moon
illuminating the whole landscape

279
00:15:22,633 --> 00:15:25,644
pretty far down on the left hand side.

280
00:15:26,845 --> 00:15:32,081
And a beautiful view of the Mount Fuji
from the International Space Station.

281
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:36,920
As mentioned before,
the low Earth orbit is one thing

282
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:39,929
and there will always be work
to be done on LEO,

283
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,702
but the Moon and beyond,
this will happen,

284
00:15:42,703 --> 00:15:45,696
and the Moon is not a bad place
to go either.

285
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:52,260
This is a nice view from
the NASA Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter

286
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,993
low flying over the Moon,
with the Earth on the background.

287
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:56,333
Superb.

288
00:15:56,334 --> 00:15:59,921
There will be further away destinations,
beyond the Moon.

289
00:15:59,922 --> 00:16:03,035
This is the asteroid Ceres, 
detail from the Dawn spacecraft

290
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:05,882
which was mentioned on a previous video.

291
00:16:05,883 --> 00:16:07,250
it's kind of a dead world,

292
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,741
no atmosphere, obviously,

293
00:16:08,742 --> 00:16:12,752
but again, this would be the subject
of exploration, visits,

294
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:15,502
exploration and utilization also,

295
00:16:15,502 --> 00:16:19,258
extracting resources from
our near-by celestial bodies,

296
00:16:19,259 --> 00:16:21,723
planets, or asteroids.

297
00:16:22,984 --> 00:16:26,665
The planet Mars is obviously
a key destination for robotics

298
00:16:26,667 --> 00:16:30,249
and human space flights
over the next few decades,

299
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,292
and here you have a set
of four beautiful pictures

300
00:16:34,292 --> 00:16:38,374
recorded by the Mars Reconnaissance
orbiter of NASA,

301
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:42,709
showing dunes, and craters, and ridges,

302
00:16:42,709 --> 00:16:46,583
and it's really a fantastic,
extremely interesting world

303
00:16:46,584 --> 00:16:48,611
that will soon be explored by humans.

304
00:16:49,762 --> 00:16:53,279
And good luck to all of you
in your future studies and careers.

305
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,464
Stay motivated and have fun!
