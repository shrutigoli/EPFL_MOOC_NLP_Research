1
00:00:05,774 --> 00:00:07,226
Well, here we go.

2
00:00:07,226 --> 00:00:09,393
Orion and Space Launch System.

3
00:00:09,393 --> 00:00:12,224
This is the system that has been developed

4
00:00:12,224 --> 00:00:17,891
by NASA for journeys to the Moon,
Mars, and beyond.

5
00:00:18,251 --> 00:00:20,204
So it's in full development now,

6
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:24,838
it's built by the company Lockheed Martin,

7
00:00:24,838 --> 00:00:29,679
and here you see the so-called CM
or crew module, or command module,

8
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,337
similar to the command module
of the Apollo spacecraft.

9
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:37,799
And here in the back, we have
the ESA-developed SM, or service module.

10
00:00:37,799 --> 00:00:42,139
Obviously, if you have missions
in the vicinity of the Earth or the Moon,

11
00:00:42,139 --> 00:00:44,335
you could possibly go
with such a spacecraft,

12
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:46,256
although, if you want to land on the Moon,

13
00:00:46,256 --> 00:00:51,483
you need, in addition, a lunar lander,
like we had in the Apollo program.

14
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:54,305
If you want to go to Mars,
you need also an extension,

15
00:00:54,985 --> 00:00:58,302
you need a crew module
for a long journey to the Red Planet,

16
00:00:58,732 --> 00:01:02,076
but this is the basic spacecraft
that will allow the command

17
00:01:02,076 --> 00:01:07,423
of the journeys beyond
the lower orbit of the Earth.

18
00:01:08,013 --> 00:01:10,986
Well, we are at the end of March, 2016,

19
00:01:10,986 --> 00:01:13,437
when this video was recorded,

20
00:01:13,437 --> 00:01:17,349
and NASA recently published
some details about Orion

21
00:01:17,349 --> 00:01:18,960
and about this Space Launch System.

22
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,005
And this is what motivated us
to create this short video.

23
00:01:23,005 --> 00:01:26,389
Here you see, on a mock-up
at the Johnson Space Center,

24
00:01:26,389 --> 00:01:28,050
you see two crew members

25
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:31,500
in the Shuttle-type 
launch and entry suit, the Orion suit,

26
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:36,389
that are ingressing into
the Orion module.

27
00:01:36,389 --> 00:01:41,245
So this is the ingress and egress hatch
on the right-hand side of the module,

28
00:01:41,245 --> 00:01:44,986
and you see the windows
in the front here,

29
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:48,456
and this is the reaction control system,

30
00:01:48,456 --> 00:01:53,211
whenever you have the crew module alone
detached from the service module.

31
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:57,936
This is what you use to control
the spacecraft in pitch, roll, and yaw,

32
00:01:57,936 --> 00:02:01,572
and also for doing translations
of the module.

33
00:02:02,502 --> 00:02:05,682
We're here we see some details
of the Orion spacecraft module,

34
00:02:05,682 --> 00:02:08,799
and especially, the interface
to the Space Launch System,

35
00:02:08,799 --> 00:02:11,369
which is a rocket
that will take Orion to space,

36
00:02:11,369 --> 00:02:14,089
and that will be described later.

37
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:17,823
Now the front part is
the so-called launched abort tower.

38
00:02:17,823 --> 00:02:23,394
It's a system that has been used
on all crewed-capsule programs,

39
00:02:23,394 --> 00:02:26,586
starting with Mercury,
and Gemini, and Apollo.

40
00:02:26,586 --> 00:02:29,516
You have this tower with the rockets here

41
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:33,869
that will extract the crew module
from the rocket,

42
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:36,736
in case you have a big problem,
a launch explosion at the launch,

43
00:02:36,736 --> 00:02:42,526
or unplanned trajectory
that you can always escape,

44
00:02:42,526 --> 00:02:44,354
using this launch abort tower.

45
00:02:44,354 --> 00:02:46,592
You have the crew module,
or the command module here,

46
00:02:46,592 --> 00:02:50,674
with two up to six crew members,
normally four;

47
00:02:51,424 --> 00:02:53,298
you have the service module
in the back,

48
00:02:53,318 --> 00:02:58,869
and you have the spacecraft adapter
adapting the module

49
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,386
to the Space Launch System.

50
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:05,290
Some details here about the components
of the Orion Spacecraft:

51
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:08,570
again, the CM here,
and the SM at the back,

52
00:03:08,570 --> 00:03:11,601
with the solar arrays, four solar arrays.

53
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,684
And you have the entry hatch
on the side,

54
00:03:15,684 --> 00:03:19,817
the attitude control system
of the command module itself,

55
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:24,402
but you also have maneuver thrusters
in the service module itself,

56
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:28,138
as long the CM is attached to SM,

57
00:03:28,138 --> 00:03:32,769
the attitude control is done
with the maneuvering thrusters of the SM.

58
00:03:32,769 --> 00:03:35,168
Some more details here,

59
00:03:35,168 --> 00:03:39,739
but the combination of the CM,
crew module and the service module

60
00:03:39,739 --> 00:03:43,742
and you can see the size
in comparison with a human being here

61
00:03:43,742 --> 00:03:47,998
in the back of the SM, you have
a few thrusters, you have

62
00:03:47,998 --> 00:03:49,896
the main propulsion system here,

63
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:53,098
but you have, in addition,
a few small thrusters,

64
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:56,753
similar to the reaction control system
of the Space Shuttle.

65
00:03:57,373 --> 00:04:00,460
Now the service module will be provided
by the European Space Agency,

66
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,847
and this has been a decision
done a few years ago.

67
00:04:02,847 --> 00:04:04,749
ESA is actively working

68
00:04:04,749 --> 00:04:08,870
on the design and construction
of the first service module,

69
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:13,646
and you see the heritage with the ATV,

70
00:04:13,646 --> 00:04:15,299
the Automatic Transfer Vehicle.

71
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,884
Here, you have the ATV approaching
the International Space Station

72
00:04:17,884 --> 00:04:21,281
from the back, with the four solar arrays

73
00:04:22,761 --> 00:04:25,640
a classical configuration
that has been seen many times.

74
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:29,874
And you see that the service module
of Orion provided by ESA

75
00:04:29,874 --> 00:04:33,115
has a very similar geometry, except
that we have a thruster in the back,

76
00:04:33,115 --> 00:04:35,812
which we didn't have
in the case of ATV.

77
00:04:37,162 --> 00:04:41,210
This is a draft version
of the control station of Orion,

78
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:45,611
for the two crew members
who will be in charge of the control

79
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:48,969
out of the possibly
four or six crew members total.

80
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:51,687
What is interesting is
that you have a flat screen,

81
00:04:51,687 --> 00:04:55,563
which is also implemented
in the modern fighters--

82
00:04:55,563 --> 00:04:58,163
if you look at the F-18
or such modern fighters--

83
00:04:58,163 --> 00:05:00,254
you have a similar control system.

84
00:05:01,644 --> 00:05:04,693
You have here
the translation hand controller

85
00:05:04,693 --> 00:05:08,583
which in its geometry is very similar
to the THC of the Space Shuttle,

86
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:13,309
used also for the control of the robotics
from the International Space Station

87
00:05:13,309 --> 00:05:19,685
either the Cupola or the control station
of the robotics in the US Lab.

88
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,340
For the rest, you have switches,

89
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,343
switches that are always guarded,

90
00:05:23,343 --> 00:05:27,191
so that you don't inadvertently change
the position in weightlessness.

91
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:29,758
Anyway, this is a draft version,
it will certainly evolve,

92
00:05:29,758 --> 00:05:34,489
but that's what Lockheed Martin
has come up with at this time.

93
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:38,460
We already talked about
the missions of Orion,

94
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,080
it's basically going beyond
low-Earth orbits,

95
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:42,830
to the Moon, Mars, and beyond.

96
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,837
One of the missions
that could be performed relatively early

97
00:05:45,837 --> 00:05:50,293
would be, first of all,
the capture of an asteroid

98
00:05:50,293 --> 00:05:53,732
in the vicinity of the Earth
with the robotic spacecraft,

99
00:05:53,732 --> 00:05:56,951
and this asteroid will be brought
in the vicinity of the Moon,

100
00:05:56,951 --> 00:06:01,272
either on the Moon's orbit
or the Lagrange point L1 or L2,

101
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:03,301
of the Earth-Moon system.

102
00:06:03,301 --> 00:06:06,963
And then, a crewed Orion
will be going toward the asteroid

103
00:06:06,963 --> 00:06:10,013
and the astronauts will be picking up
pieces of the asteroid

104
00:06:10,013 --> 00:06:13,769
and doing some exploration
of this big piece of rock

105
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:15,470
captured by the robotic system.

106
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:20,067
That could be one of the first missions
of Orion in the mid 20s.

107
00:06:21,437 --> 00:06:24,868
In the bottom, you see
the comparison of the size of Orion,

108
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:27,483
and you see that is very similar in size,

109
00:06:27,483 --> 00:06:31,728
at least, as far as
the crew module is concerned at least,

110
00:06:31,728 --> 00:06:33,246
with the Apollo spacecraft,

111
00:06:33,246 --> 00:06:36,988
and you see the comparison in size
with the Dragon and with Soyuz.

112
00:06:36,988 --> 00:06:41,129
Again, for Soyuz, you have
the descent module here,

113
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:43,274
you have the orbital module here,

114
00:06:43,274 --> 00:06:45,306
and the service module at the back.

115
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:47,456
SLS, the Space Launch System

116
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:51,223
is a big rocket, Saturn V type
developed by NASA

117
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:55,261
and the aerospace industry in the US.

118
00:06:55,981 --> 00:06:59,165
A very large rocket, it should be
able to take about 70 tons

119
00:06:59,165 --> 00:07:01,432
to low-Earth orbits in the early version

120
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:04,541
and up to 150 tons for the later versions.

121
00:07:05,451 --> 00:07:07,630
If we look at the various stages,

122
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:10,903
we have pretty much like,
for the Shuttle, we have

123
00:07:13,923 --> 00:07:17,442
LH2, a liquid hydrogen tank,
this is the fuel;

124
00:07:17,442 --> 00:07:21,372
we have here the LOX tank,
liquid oxygen.

125
00:07:21,372 --> 00:07:24,313
This is pretty much like we had
in the external tank of the Space Shuttle

126
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:28,333
with the LOX at the top,
and the LH2, much larger, in the bottom.

127
00:07:29,463 --> 00:07:32,012
Two solid rocket boosters,
which you see here,

128
00:07:32,012 --> 00:07:36,314
with one segment more than we had
for the Space Shuttle,

129
00:07:36,314 --> 00:07:40,593
and these are the nozzles
of the two solid rocket boosters.

130
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:46,403
in the bottom of the cold stage
we have four liquid hydrogen engines,

131
00:07:46,403 --> 00:07:49,007
pretty much like the Space Shuttle's
main engines,

132
00:07:49,007 --> 00:07:55,385
but re-manufactured and improved
liquid hydrogen engines.

133
00:07:56,175 --> 00:07:58,102
On the top, we have the upper stage,

134
00:07:58,102 --> 00:08:00,333
that will provide the extra thrusters

135
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:04,462
for taking the Orion crew module
and service module

136
00:08:04,462 --> 00:08:07,060
to its destination
beyond the low-Earth orbit

137
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,735
and, as mentioned before,

138
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:12,502
you have a crew module,
and a service module

139
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:14,971
and here we have four crew members

140
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:17,650
and this is the escape tower
with a little rocket

141
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,238
that can allow extraction of the CM
and CM only,

142
00:08:22,238 --> 00:08:25,522
in case we have a problem
with the rocket at launch.

143
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:30,869
In the middle, and on the right-hand side

144
00:08:30,869 --> 00:08:33,977
you have some details
of the upper part of the rocket here,

145
00:08:33,977 --> 00:08:38,019
and some details also about
the propulsion system itself,

146
00:08:38,019 --> 00:08:42,381
and the LOX and the liquid hydrogen tanks.

147
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:46,655
This is the launch of Space Launch System

148
00:08:46,655 --> 00:08:48,549
with the Orion on the top,

149
00:08:48,549 --> 00:08:52,316
and this is something that hopefully,
will be reasonably a common view

150
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:55,338
in 10, 15, 20 years from now,

151
00:08:55,338 --> 00:08:57,668
and the ones of you who want
to become astronauts,

152
00:08:57,668 --> 00:09:01,737
you may be able to ride on top
of that rocket someday.

153
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:03,451
I wish it for you.
