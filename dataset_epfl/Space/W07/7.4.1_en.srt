1
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:08,125
Let's talk about astronaut training today.

2
00:00:08,987 --> 00:00:11,666
You have been selected
as an astronaut candidate,

3
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:15,236
wherever it is, in the US,
in Russia, in Europe,

4
00:00:15,237 --> 00:00:18,717
in Canada, in Japan,
or in China, or wherever it is,

5
00:00:19,437 --> 00:00:21,686
and most of the time,
in these countries,

6
00:00:21,687 --> 00:00:23,951
when you are selected,
you are not really an astronaut,

7
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:28,313
bur you are an astronaut candidate
and you have to go through training,

8
00:00:28,313 --> 00:00:32,192
and before you go to such a training
as in the centrifuge,

9
00:00:32,209 --> 00:00:34,622
in zero G airplanes, in simulators,

10
00:00:34,623 --> 00:00:36,532
you have a so-called basic training,

11
00:00:36,533 --> 00:00:42,063
where you learn about space engineering,
about space science, about medicine,

12
00:00:42,083 --> 00:00:43,662
and you have to learn languages--

13
00:00:43,782 --> 00:00:48,377
it's obviously
a multi-language undertaking

14
00:00:48,393 --> 00:00:53,172
with English and Russian,
and possibly Chinese--

15
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:59,113
and where you have to learn
the other partners' languages,

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,995
and basically, for the Space Station,
it's English and Russian.

17
00:01:04,715 --> 00:01:08,589
This is the basic training that takes
about one year, or a year and a half,

18
00:01:08,589 --> 00:01:10,650
then you go
into a so-called advanced training

19
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:13,145
where you learn more about
the spaceships themselves,

20
00:01:13,145 --> 00:01:17,543
whether it is the Soyuz
and the International Space Station,

21
00:01:17,543 --> 00:01:19,819
or whatever vehicle
they are going to be using

22
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:21,439
for your space missions.

23
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:24,843
Here you see a centrifuge in Star City.

24
00:01:24,843 --> 00:01:27,061
Of course, going to space,
you are going to be exposed

25
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:30,602
to pretty large G forces,
acceleration going up,

26
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:32,617
coming down also,

27
00:01:33,217 --> 00:01:36,138
whether it is with the Space Shuttle,
or whether it is with the Soyuz

28
00:01:36,138 --> 00:01:39,220
or any other ascent
or entry spaceship.

29
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,142
And then, during your mission,

30
00:01:42,142 --> 00:01:44,652
whether it's a few weeks
or a few months--

31
00:01:44,652 --> 00:01:46,642
possibly a few years in the future--

32
00:01:46,642 --> 00:01:48,414
you are going to be exposed to zero G,

33
00:01:48,414 --> 00:01:53,870
so you have to have the possibility
to train in these high G environments

34
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,811
and also low G environment.

35
00:01:55,811 --> 00:01:58,188
This is a centrifuge in Star City

36
00:01:58,188 --> 00:01:59,538
where cosmonauts and astronauts

37
00:01:59,538 --> 00:02:02,040
get exposed 
to the relatively high G forces

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,752
you have for the ascent into space,
with the Soyuz,

39
00:02:04,752 --> 00:02:07,451
or the re-entry in the atmosphere,

40
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:13,233
and the touchdown in Kazakstan
with the Soyuz.

41
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:16,866
A similar training was done
for the Space Shuttle.

42
00:02:16,866 --> 00:02:19,666
We had the opportunity
to go through the profile,

43
00:02:19,666 --> 00:02:22,409
the G profile of the ascent into space,

44
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:26,588
which was going to a maximum
of 3G only, for the Space Shuttle.

45
00:02:26,588 --> 00:02:28,716
We didn't do any training
for the re-entry,

46
00:02:28,716 --> 00:02:30,946
because at Shuttle 
we only had 1G and a half maximum

47
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:32,170
during the re-entry.

48
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,236
But anyway, high G environment training
in a centrifuge

49
00:02:35,236 --> 00:02:37,431
is part of the astronaut training.

50
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:39,640
Zero G training:
we don't do a lot of that;

51
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:43,473
and this is fun: we do it
in a so-called zero G airplane,

52
00:02:43,473 --> 00:02:45,087
where we fly parabolic trajectories,

53
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:49,173
a few parabolas, maybe 10, 20,
or more parabolas per flight

54
00:02:49,173 --> 00:02:52,040
and during the parabolas,

55
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:54,421
we are exposed to zero G,

56
00:02:54,421 --> 00:02:58,653
basically zero G
for about 20 seconds per parabola.

57
00:02:58,973 --> 00:03:00,281
We don't do a lot of that,

58
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:02,638
but each astronaut has the opportunity

59
00:03:02,638 --> 00:03:05,418
to do one or few flights
in zero G airplanes,

60
00:03:05,418 --> 00:03:08,402
to be familiarized 
with the zero G environment.

61
00:03:09,812 --> 00:03:13,373
Simulator training: this is of course,
part of the advanced training,

62
00:03:13,373 --> 00:03:14,953
or the mission-specific training,

63
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:17,420
and of course, before getting
into the simulator--

64
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,524
whether it is Soyuz, which you see here,

65
00:03:21,414 --> 00:03:24,378
or Shuttle,
or any other ascent or entry vehicle--

66
00:03:25,368 --> 00:03:27,126
there is a lot of classroom training,

67
00:03:27,126 --> 00:03:32,174
there is the use of also
part-task trainers,

68
00:03:32,174 --> 00:03:35,363
where you train the use
of a specific system

69
00:03:35,363 --> 00:03:39,433
before you get the integrated training
in the simulator itself.

70
00:03:39,433 --> 00:03:42,478
And some of the simulators
are fix-based simulators,

71
00:03:42,478 --> 00:03:44,445
others are motion-based simulators,

72
00:03:44,445 --> 00:03:46,813
where you can see all the dynamics 
of the ascent

73
00:03:46,813 --> 00:03:48,883
or the entry of the spaceship.

74
00:03:49,493 --> 00:03:51,897
Well, this is the Soyuz egress training,

75
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:55,693
this is part of training
for the use of the Soyuz spacecraft,

76
00:03:55,693 --> 00:03:58,049
and you see Tim Peake
on the left-hand side,

77
00:03:58,049 --> 00:04:00,130
with the so-called suit,

78
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,684
egressing the Soyuz spacecraft,

79
00:04:04,684 --> 00:04:08,066
and on the right-hand side, you see--

80
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:11,331
there is always a possibility
that Soyuz would get into the water

81
00:04:11,331 --> 00:04:13,610
and there is training also
for this situation.

82
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:19,097
There is always a possibility
that Soyuz will touch down

83
00:04:19,097 --> 00:04:21,970
on planet Earth, not at a planned location

84
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:26,507
east of Baikonur, in Kazakhstan
which is a normal case

85
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:28,417
but possibly in a remote area,

86
00:04:28,417 --> 00:04:31,604
and the astronauts and the cosmonauts
may have to survive

87
00:04:32,504 --> 00:04:34,553
for few hours, or maybe a few days,

88
00:04:34,553 --> 00:04:36,589
so this training takes place.

89
00:04:36,589 --> 00:04:38,805
Is also a character training, I would say.

90
00:04:38,805 --> 00:04:42,036
Because you are exposed
to a pretty hard environment,

91
00:04:42,036 --> 00:04:43,582
you have to take care of yourself,

92
00:04:43,582 --> 00:04:46,787
and your health, and your survival,

93
00:04:46,787 --> 00:04:51,214
and generally speaking,
it's training that is done

94
00:04:51,214 --> 00:04:52,748
since many, many years,

95
00:04:52,748 --> 00:04:54,607
and is still being done today

96
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:57,530
in relationship with the use
of the Russian spacecraft.

97
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:02,438
In the past, a lot of the Shuttle training
was done in the simulator,

98
00:05:02,438 --> 00:05:04,906
and at the Johnson Space Center Houston,

99
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:08,049
we had a fix-based simulator
for the Shuttle,

100
00:05:08,049 --> 00:05:09,455
and a motion-based simulator,

101
00:05:09,455 --> 00:05:11,957
and here you see the training of the crew.

102
00:05:11,957 --> 00:05:13,546
You had the Commander on the left,

103
00:05:13,546 --> 00:05:15,141
the pilot on the right-hand side,

104
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:17,919
and the flight engineer
or mission specialist number two,

105
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:19,540
in the middle, with procedures,

106
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:23,604
and this was an extensive part
of the Shuttle training.

107
00:05:23,604 --> 00:05:25,931
The Shuttle was very complex spacecraft,

108
00:05:25,931 --> 00:05:29,565
and it was really needed to do
a lot of this training.

109
00:05:29,565 --> 00:05:33,144
This is a very realistic environment,

110
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:35,438
you see the use of procedures,
you see the cue cards,

111
00:05:35,438 --> 00:05:41,191
you see big timers, timers
on the front part of the instrument panel.

112
00:05:41,772 --> 00:05:43,388
Of course, some of this training

113
00:05:43,388 --> 00:05:45,782
was done also wearing
the launch-and-entry suit.

114
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:47,840
Here you see them wearing light clothing,

115
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,600
but some of it was done
in the launch-and-entry suit.

116
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,396
And some of it was done
in the motion-based simulator

117
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:57,320
where you had the Shuttle
with the same orientation

118
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,133
as we had for the launch,

119
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:02,756
that is that crew members
were lying on the back of their seat

120
00:06:02,756 --> 00:06:04,699
with their feet up.

121
00:06:05,219 --> 00:06:08,050
NASA always gave a lot of importance
to flight training,

122
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:09,800
flight training in airplanes,

123
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:13,833
and since the early space program,
the Mercury Program,

124
00:06:13,833 --> 00:06:18,062
the Gemini, Apollo,
T-38s were used;

125
00:06:18,062 --> 00:06:23,708
it's originally a two-seat, two-jet engine
training airplane for the US Force,

126
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,196
but about 30 of these airplanes

127
00:06:26,196 --> 00:06:30,046
have been regularly used by NASA
for the maintenance

128
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:32,460
of the flight qualification 
of all astronauts,

129
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,856
whether they were commanders,
pilots, or even mission specialists

130
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,891
who were flying in the back seats.

131
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:39,322
And also for travel:

132
00:06:39,322 --> 00:06:43,268
very flexible and fast travel
provided by the T-38.

133
00:06:43,268 --> 00:06:46,578
It was a lot of fun,
but work at the same time,

134
00:06:46,578 --> 00:06:50,014
and you had to work very rigorously
with the procedures

135
00:06:50,014 --> 00:06:54,501
and be systematic
and do your flight planning

136
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:56,513
and make your decisions during flight,

137
00:06:56,513 --> 00:06:58,564
if the weather was bad,
you had to divert places,

138
00:06:58,564 --> 00:07:02,435
it was a good mental, physical,
and operational training.

139
00:07:04,005 --> 00:07:07,169
For Space Station training,
an extensive use is made

140
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:09,878
of the facility
at the Johnston Space Center;

141
00:07:09,878 --> 00:07:12,125
it's a set of mock-ups
of all of the elements

142
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:14,092
of the International Space Station.

143
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:16,349
You have Node One here,

144
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:18,402
you have the airlock.

145
00:07:19,032 --> 00:07:21,976
In front of Node One you have the US Lab,

146
00:07:21,976 --> 00:07:25,335
then you have Node 2,
and attached to the Node 2 are,

147
00:07:25,335 --> 00:07:28,638
on the port side,
the Kybo Japanese Lab,

148
00:07:28,638 --> 00:07:32,158
on the starboard side, you have
the Columbus Lab from ESA,

149
00:07:32,778 --> 00:07:36,958
so it's training for the use of these
various facilities, accommodation,

150
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:41,495
and you don't train the whole mission
in these mock-ups,

151
00:07:41,495 --> 00:07:43,259
but you mainly train accommodation:

152
00:07:43,259 --> 00:07:47,580
the use of the restroom
of your sleep facility

153
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,930
for each crew member,

154
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,516
that's where you find your place
and you train

155
00:07:51,516 --> 00:07:55,122
the use of these various subsets
of the International Space Station.

156
00:07:57,492 --> 00:08:00,140
Well, the International Space Station
is a multinational undertaking:

157
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:03,035
you have the US, you have Russia,
you have Canada, Japan,

158
00:08:03,035 --> 00:08:04,405
and the European countries,

159
00:08:04,405 --> 00:08:07,322
and the astronauts and the cosmonauts

160
00:08:07,322 --> 00:08:12,567
who are planned to be
part of expedition on ISS,

161
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:14,848
typically for six months at a time,

162
00:08:14,848 --> 00:08:16,798
trained in these various countries.

163
00:08:16,798 --> 00:08:18,839
They train robotics in Canada first,

164
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:21,699
and then they train robotics
in an integrated manner

165
00:08:21,699 --> 00:08:23,185
to the Johnson Space Center;

166
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:26,190
it's a lot of training in Russia
for the Soyuz;

167
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:30,152
training in Europe
for the use of the Columbus system

168
00:08:30,152 --> 00:08:32,377
and possibly, for--, in the past,

169
00:08:32,377 --> 00:08:35,037
it was the reception
of the automatic transfer vehicle,

170
00:08:35,037 --> 00:08:39,099
the resupply vehicle to ISS
provided by ESA.

171
00:08:41,019 --> 00:08:44,429
And of course, in the US,
you trained in an integrated manner

172
00:08:44,429 --> 00:08:47,198
for all of these components
that are put together

173
00:08:47,198 --> 00:08:48,809
at the Johnson Space Center.

174
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:54,480
Here you see Naoko Yamazaki,

175
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:57,472
JAXA astronaut, is training

176
00:08:57,472 --> 00:09:00,856
on the robotic workstation
at the Johnson Space Center

177
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:03,359
She has on her right hand,

178
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:06,759
the rotation hand controller
for the robotic system,

179
00:09:06,759 --> 00:09:10,600
left hand--this is very standard--
was mentioned already several times,

180
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,872
on the left hand she had
the translation hand controller

181
00:09:13,872 --> 00:09:15,405
and she has the visuals

182
00:09:16,345 --> 00:09:19,035
of the motion of the robotic arm,

183
00:09:19,035 --> 00:09:24,101
and the payload attached to it
through different monitors and cameras.

184
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:26,837
We also had a robotic workstation
in the Cupola,

185
00:09:26,837 --> 00:09:29,685
which, of course, gave the astronaut
or cosmonaut a direct view

186
00:09:29,685 --> 00:09:34,069
of the scene outside the Space Station.

187
00:09:34,069 --> 00:09:36,395
This training
at the European Astronaut Centre

188
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:37,780
in Cologne, Germany,

189
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:42,516
Samantha Cristoforetti,
an Italian ESA astronaut

190
00:09:42,516 --> 00:09:45,971
training on the Columbus system,
an experiment system,

191
00:09:45,971 --> 00:09:52,958
all related with the European experiment
located in the Columbus module.

192
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:56,564
on the forward part
of the International Space Station,

193
00:09:56,564 --> 00:09:58,175
on the starboard side.

194
00:09:59,005 --> 00:10:00,633
Now, in case of the Shuttle,

195
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,378
whenever we were assigned to a flight,

196
00:10:02,378 --> 00:10:05,905
we had to do
a lot of mission-specific preparation

197
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,933
before really getting into training
we had to do some evaluations.

198
00:10:10,023 --> 00:10:13,526
This is part of the crew of ST-61,

199
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:16,096
the first servicing mission
of the Hubble Space Telescope

200
00:10:16,096 --> 00:10:20,574
which was planned for December 1993,
and was executed at that time.

201
00:10:21,174 --> 00:10:26,550
So for the year preceding this mission,
we had to do first of all

202
00:10:26,550 --> 00:10:30,485
an evaluation of how we got to do the job,
it had never been done before.

203
00:10:30,485 --> 00:10:36,408
And you see Commander Dick Cavey,
and Ken Bowersox, the pilot,

204
00:10:36,408 --> 00:10:40,062
Katie Thornton, and myself,
and in the background,

205
00:10:40,062 --> 00:10:42,161
in virtual reality, Jeff Hoffman.

206
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:44,095
And I'm here at the forefront,

207
00:10:44,095 --> 00:10:48,045
operating in a simulated environment

208
00:10:49,295 --> 00:10:50,675
the robotic arm,

209
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:52,998
and moving Jeff Hoffman
towards the telescope,

210
00:10:52,998 --> 00:10:54,603
to do a certain task.

211
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:57,181
So this was more of a strategy evaluation

212
00:10:57,181 --> 00:10:58,753
before the training started,

213
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:00,250
on one hand, in the simulators,

214
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:03,910
and also, in the water environment
for spacewalking.

215
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,090
This is another version
of the virtual reality.

216
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,700
When we started to use it
in the early 90s,

217
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,957
it was a relatively rustic virtual reality

218
00:11:13,957 --> 00:11:15,962
that became much more sophisticated,

219
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:20,894
and later, you see here an astronaut
having monitors in front of his eyes,

220
00:11:20,894 --> 00:11:23,908
with the scene, the space scene
and the spaceship,

221
00:11:23,908 --> 00:11:26,162
and he can also see his hands,

222
00:11:26,162 --> 00:11:28,927
because you have sensors
on his hands,

223
00:11:28,927 --> 00:11:33,089
so that here, you can see from outside
his real physical hands,

224
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:36,845
but he himself can see in virtual reality

225
00:11:38,395 --> 00:11:39,967
his virtual hands,

226
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,910
moving, in order to accomplish
certain tasks.

227
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,987
So the virtual reality lab has become
very sophisticated

228
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:47,558
at the Johnson Space Center,

229
00:11:47,558 --> 00:11:50,460
it's a very, very useful tool
for, on one hand, evaluations

230
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,175
of certain tasks to be performed,

231
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:54,726
but then, also training
for the astronauts.

232
00:11:54,726 --> 00:11:58,309
Spacewalking, or EVA training
is done in the US

233
00:11:58,309 --> 00:12:01,240
in a large facility called
The Neutral Buoyancy Lab.

234
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,724
And you see in front,

235
00:12:03,724 --> 00:12:08,090
an astronaut just before
a training session in the water,

236
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,661
and in this large basin,
we had a module

237
00:12:12,661 --> 00:12:14,047
of the International Space Center,

238
00:12:14,047 --> 00:12:16,905
of various components
of the International Space Station.

239
00:12:16,905 --> 00:12:18,442
In the past, we also had a model,

240
00:12:18,442 --> 00:12:21,589
a pretty high fidelity model
of the Hubble Space Telescope

241
00:12:21,589 --> 00:12:24,837
in preparation for the repair
or the maintenance mission

242
00:12:24,837 --> 00:12:26,057
of the telescope.

243
00:12:26,057 --> 00:12:29,631
The space suit being used here
is very similar to the EMU,

244
00:12:29,631 --> 00:12:32,781
the extra vehicular mobility unit
used in space.

245
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:37,643
What is important is that we always have
the same differential pressure

246
00:12:37,643 --> 00:12:39,808
between the inside of the suit
and the outside.

247
00:12:40,758 --> 00:12:44,591
In the case of the EMU 
it is 4.3 pounds per square inche,

248
00:12:44,591 --> 00:12:45,906
or about a third of bar.

249
00:12:45,906 --> 00:12:48,726
And it's important,
in the water, to always keep

250
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:51,166
that differential pressure at that value,

251
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,808
because this is what determined
the rigidity of the suit,

252
00:12:53,808 --> 00:12:56,605
and you want to train in an environment
which had the rigidity

253
00:12:56,605 --> 00:12:59,966
very similar to the one
that you are going to have in space.

254
00:12:59,966 --> 00:13:03,268
So, in order to achieve that--
because if you go up and down in the water

255
00:13:03,268 --> 00:13:06,514
there was a rapid change in the pressure--

256
00:13:06,514 --> 00:13:08,024
there is an umbilical

257
00:13:08,024 --> 00:13:10,794
that is linked to the suit

258
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:13,021
and provides air under pressure

259
00:13:13,021 --> 00:13:15,273
in order to always maintain
that differential pressure

260
00:13:15,273 --> 00:13:17,467
that you would have in space.

261
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:21,484
But the rest of the suit
is very similar to the EMU.

262
00:13:22,294 --> 00:13:26,278
This is a practicing the Hubble repair
in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab.

263
00:13:26,278 --> 00:13:30,845
You see a high fidelity model
of the telescope on the right-hand side

264
00:13:30,845 --> 00:13:34,382
where astronauts are close to it,
the so-called free floater.

265
00:13:34,382 --> 00:13:37,807
A free floater means the astronaut
who is not at the end of the robotic arm

266
00:13:37,807 --> 00:13:38,898
on the platform,

267
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:41,584
so he or she has the responsibility

268
00:13:41,584 --> 00:13:47,261
of moving around using the hand rail,
the yellow hand rail on the telescope,

269
00:13:47,261 --> 00:13:48,928
or at the payload bay,

270
00:13:48,928 --> 00:13:52,995
and also, locating himself or herself
in the proper position to do the task.

271
00:13:52,995 --> 00:13:55,877
The other one on the lower right-hand side

272
00:13:56,767 --> 00:14:01,101
is the so-called EV 1,

273
00:14:01,101 --> 00:14:04,629
the extra vehicular crew member number one

274
00:14:04,629 --> 00:14:07,332
who is on the platform
at the end of the robotic arm.

275
00:14:08,182 --> 00:14:14,223
And you see that he is holding
a camera, inserted in the telescope,

276
00:14:14,223 --> 00:14:15,563
in a radial position,

277
00:14:15,563 --> 00:14:17,853
and you see
his portable life support system

278
00:14:17,853 --> 00:14:19,232
on his back,

279
00:14:19,232 --> 00:14:25,355
and you see the umbilical system
that is providing pressurized air,

280
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:26,618
as I mentioned before,

281
00:14:26,618 --> 00:14:28,973
and also communication
and cooling.

282
00:14:28,973 --> 00:14:30,958
A similar training in the NBL
is done, of course,

283
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,644
for the International Space Station.

284
00:14:32,644 --> 00:14:36,814
The Hubble Space Telescope repair mission
is something of the past

285
00:14:36,814 --> 00:14:39,223
although it was a very fruitful activity

286
00:14:39,223 --> 00:14:43,214
and helped really prepare for the work
to be done

287
00:14:43,214 --> 00:14:46,061
outside of the International Space Station
and spacewalking,

288
00:14:46,061 --> 00:14:51,740
but here, you see an astronaut in the NBL,
training for some operation

289
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,336
in the International Space Station.

290
00:14:54,336 --> 00:14:57,029
Of course, we have divers around,
helping for the operation.

291
00:14:58,289 --> 00:15:02,061
This is not specifically training,
but it's to a certain degree,

292
00:15:02,061 --> 00:15:03,121
related to training.

293
00:15:03,121 --> 00:15:06,675
This is the return of a crew
from the International Space Station

294
00:15:06,675 --> 00:15:07,840
on the board of Soyuz,

295
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,323
this was in the early March of 2016.

296
00:15:11,833 --> 00:15:17,057
You have, Mikhail Kornienko
on the left-hand side,

297
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:21,420
in the middle you have Sergei Volkov
and Scott Kelly on the right-hand side,

298
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:26,335
and both Kornienko and Scott Kelly
had spent one year in space,

299
00:15:26,335 --> 00:15:33,105
an this is a recovery post-touchdown
of the Soyuz re-entry vehicle

300
00:15:33,105 --> 00:15:37,098
in Kazakhstan, east of Baikonur.

301
00:15:37,098 --> 00:15:38,885
Of course, you have a lot of people around

302
00:15:38,885 --> 00:15:40,139
who came with helicopters,

303
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:42,846
you have medical doctors,
and officials, and so on.

304
00:15:42,846 --> 00:15:44,167
And the crew is recovering,

305
00:15:44,167 --> 00:15:46,750
of course, two of them spent
a long time in space,

306
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,413
and even Sergey Volkov six months,

307
00:15:48,413 --> 00:15:49,832
which is quite a long time.

308
00:15:49,832 --> 00:15:53,524
In order to be able to to be
in a reasonably good shape

309
00:15:53,524 --> 00:15:54,724
when you come back,

310
00:15:54,724 --> 00:15:59,087
it's necessary for all ISS astronauts
to spend quite a lot of time

311
00:15:59,087 --> 00:16:00,460
doing physical training;

312
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:07,317
to the order of two hours per day,
or 24 hours, in the Space Station.

313
00:16:08,007 --> 00:16:09,527
So the crew is recovering,

314
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:12,959
and, of course, they will go through
a lot of medical checks and tests

315
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:14,092
for several weeks,

316
00:16:14,092 --> 00:16:16,911
and will go back to normal life
on planet Earth.

317
00:16:19,001 --> 00:16:23,010
Basically, there is no long-term effect
of spaceflight,

318
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:27,308
even if you spent a few months
in space, and possibly one year,

319
00:16:27,308 --> 00:16:30,256
although the one year-stay on ISS
is something new,

320
00:16:30,256 --> 00:16:32,233
and the crew
is still recovering from that,

321
00:16:32,233 --> 00:16:34,168
but no long-term effects

322
00:16:35,628 --> 00:16:38,602
from the point of view of bone mass loss,

323
00:16:38,602 --> 00:16:41,169
which is something
that was happening in the past,

324
00:16:41,169 --> 00:16:43,942
when the astronauts
and the cosmonauts didn't do

325
00:16:43,942 --> 00:16:45,600
a lot of physical training on board,

326
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,936
but now, with the extensive
physical training, and very rigorous,

327
00:16:48,936 --> 00:16:53,670
the bone loss mass,
which was a problem in the past,

328
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,997
is no longer a big problem now.

329
00:16:56,790 --> 00:17:02,248
And muscle reconditioning
is done by, again, physical exercise

330
00:17:02,248 --> 00:17:04,809
on the Earth, following return.

331
00:17:05,899 --> 00:17:10,436
Of course, you have
a reasonable amount of radiation dose,

332
00:17:10,436 --> 00:17:13,792
which you had during the six months
in space, or one year;

333
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:17,415
this is not a big problem per se,

334
00:17:17,415 --> 00:17:19,950
but of course, you cannot do
many, many missions

335
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,809
of six months or one year,
one after the other.

336
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:26,738
There are sometimes some problems
in the eyes;

337
00:17:26,738 --> 00:17:30,259
you have somewhat of a change
in the geometry of eyes,

338
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:33,695
so that you have possibly,
some long term effect,

339
00:17:33,695 --> 00:17:36,723
which are not very severe,
but require possibly,

340
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:42,131
the use of glasses, or change
of the characteristics of the glasses

341
00:17:42,131 --> 00:17:43,990
that you were wearing.

342
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:47,990
So no bad long-term effects
following a long-duration spaceflight.
