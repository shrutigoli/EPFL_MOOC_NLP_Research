1
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:09,459
In this video, we'll cover
the subject of space suits,

2
00:00:09,459 --> 00:00:14,433
and also, some mobility aids
for spacewalking astronauts.

3
00:00:15,025 --> 00:00:17,004
But before we had space suits,

4
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:20,542
we had high altitude pilot suits
in high flying airplanes

5
00:00:20,554 --> 00:00:22,703
like the X-15, which you see here,

6
00:00:23,334 --> 00:00:28,363
which had the record of height and speed
for any airplane

7
00:00:28,364 --> 00:00:30,455
in fact, it went even into space,

8
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:33,168
more than 100 km altitude
on some of the flights.

9
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:37,209
The pilot here is Joe Engle,
who was an X-15 pilot,

10
00:00:37,209 --> 00:00:40,146
and became later an astronaut
in the Shuttle program.

11
00:00:40,987 --> 00:00:42,604
Now, the idea was the following:

12
00:00:42,605 --> 00:00:47,015
to protect the pilot against
the low pressure inside the cabin,

13
00:00:47,016 --> 00:00:50,797
either you had a partial cabin pressure,

14
00:00:50,798 --> 00:00:53,968
you had some pressurization
inside the cockpit,

15
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,827
but to a value that was
either not acceptable for survival--

16
00:00:59,828 --> 00:01:02,087
in this case you had to have
a pressure suit--

17
00:01:02,088 --> 00:01:04,760
or it was maybe a value
that was just acceptable,

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:08,521
but you wanted to be protected
in case of a cabin pressure.

19
00:01:08,521 --> 00:01:12,198
On any airplane, with a pressurized cabin,

20
00:01:12,199 --> 00:01:15,106
you always want to have
a rescue possibility,

21
00:01:15,107 --> 00:01:17,490
in case you lose cabin pressure.

22
00:01:17,491 --> 00:01:18,950
So again, X-15, U-2

23
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:24,833
and many other high flying airplanes
necessitated for the pilot to be protected

24
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:26,974
with a high altitude pilot suit.

25
00:01:26,974 --> 00:01:29,798
And all the space suits
that were developed later,

26
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,164
for the space program,

27
00:01:31,164 --> 00:01:33,650
were developed from this kind of suit.

28
00:01:34,349 --> 00:01:39,751
Well, this was quite a jump
by Felix Baumgartner in October 2012.

29
00:01:39,751 --> 00:01:44,581
He holds the record of
the highest altitude for a parachute jump;

30
00:01:44,582 --> 00:01:48,194
it was 39 kilometers
above the Earth surface

31
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:50,455
on a helium filled balloon.

32
00:01:50,456 --> 00:01:51,704
It was in Arizona,

33
00:01:51,705 --> 00:01:54,377
but he is an Austrian citizen.

34
00:01:54,378 --> 00:01:57,996
And this project was sponsored
by Red Bull.

35
00:01:57,997 --> 00:02:02,082
And here you see him
just leaving his cabin,

36
00:02:02,083 --> 00:02:04,166
39 kilometers altitude.

37
00:02:04,195 --> 00:02:05,840
He had a full pressure suit

38
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:09,571
that was developed
by David Clark Company in the US.

39
00:02:09,572 --> 00:02:12,181
In fact, it was very close

40
00:02:12,182 --> 00:02:14,568
to a spacewalking suit,

41
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:18,285
because for the first, I would say,
30 seconds of his jump,

42
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:22,047
the air is so thin, that for him,
it was like if you'd been spacewalking

43
00:02:22,048 --> 00:02:24,450
in near vacuum.

44
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:31,305
After about 30 seconds,
because of the completely negligible drag,

45
00:02:31,306 --> 00:02:33,247
due to the residual atmosphere,

46
00:02:33,248 --> 00:02:37,172
he reached a velocity
higher than the velocity of sound.

47
00:02:37,173 --> 00:02:41,208
In fact, he reached about 1.25 Mach

48
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:44,960
before reaching the lower layers
of the atmosphere

49
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:48,038
where the drag started to reduce speed,

50
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:52,196
and then, he had some problems
with the control of his body.

51
00:02:52,197 --> 00:02:54,265
He went into a kind of a spin,

52
00:02:54,266 --> 00:02:58,231
and had to put quite a lot of effort
in order to stabilize himself,

53
00:02:58,232 --> 00:03:01,958
and the rest of the lower part of the jump
was more classical,

54
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:05,764
but the high part was certainly
very close to being in space

55
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:07,947
and doing a spacewalk.

56
00:03:07,948 --> 00:03:10,082
Now this is a launch,

57
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:14,208
and the entry suit that was used
on the Shuttle for all the crew members.

58
00:03:14,209 --> 00:03:18,762
This was a development following
the Challenger accident in 1986.

59
00:03:18,763 --> 00:03:20,132
The idea was the following:

60
00:03:20,133 --> 00:03:26,097
to protect the crew against loss
at cabin pressure during the ascent.

61
00:03:26,098 --> 00:03:30,016
The suit was a partial pressured suit,

62
00:03:30,017 --> 00:03:32,451
but it provided enough pressure
on the body

63
00:03:32,452 --> 00:03:37,478
in order to assure the crew survival
in the case of a loss of cabin pressure.

64
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:39,954
And also, after the Challenger accident,

65
00:03:39,955 --> 00:03:42,614
all the crew members were equipped
with parachutes,

66
00:03:42,615 --> 00:03:45,884
and there was a possibility,
in case of multiple engine failure

67
00:03:45,885 --> 00:03:47,536
during the ascent,

68
00:03:47,537 --> 00:03:52,014
and the possibility of getting
a stable glide of the Shuttle

69
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,873
over the Atlantic Ocean.

70
00:03:53,876 --> 00:03:59,050
Then, pyrotechnically, the outer hatch
or the side hatch of the Shuttle

71
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:03,292
would have been exploded
or opened pyrotechnically,

72
00:04:03,322 --> 00:04:06,063
and all the crew members
would have jumped out

73
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:07,450
with the parachute,

74
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:10,658
and of course, they would have been
protected with a launch-and-entry suit.

75
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:13,418
But again, is not a full pressure suit--

76
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:16,232
they do not allow at all spacewalking--

77
00:04:16,233 --> 00:04:18,975
but it was for protection of the crew

78
00:04:18,976 --> 00:04:21,338
during ascent and entry
of the Space Shuttle.

79
00:04:22,526 --> 00:04:24,167
Together with the Shuttle Program,

80
00:04:24,168 --> 00:04:26,235
NASA developed the EMU,

81
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:31,714
or contractors of NASA developed the EMU--
Extravehicular Mobility Unit--

82
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:35,103
you see here the suit
used for the Shuttle Program,

83
00:04:35,104 --> 00:04:38,625
and also, subsequently,
used in the ISS program.

84
00:04:40,561 --> 00:04:42,588
Now, you see
the portable life support system here,

85
00:04:42,589 --> 00:04:48,219
containing the oxygen, for about
eight and a half hours of spacewalking,

86
00:04:48,219 --> 00:04:50,773
including a secondary oxygen pack.

87
00:04:50,774 --> 00:04:54,445
In case the main oxygen tank
for some reason, had a leak,

88
00:04:54,446 --> 00:04:58,865
or was not providing
enough oxygen to the astronaut,

89
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,332
we could engage a secondary oxygen pack

90
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:03,569
and then go to the airlock
as soon as possible,

91
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:05,292
because it was limited supply.

92
00:05:05,783 --> 00:05:09,722
The pressure in the suit
was 4.3 pound per square inch,

93
00:05:09,723 --> 00:05:11,775
which is about a third of a bar,

94
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:16,676
so a third of the atmospheric pressure
on Earth at sea level.

95
00:05:17,507 --> 00:05:22,205
And of course, is provided enough
partial pressure of oxygen

96
00:05:22,206 --> 00:05:26,345
for the crew to breathe, obviously,

97
00:05:26,896 --> 00:05:29,991
because it was even larger
than the partial pressure of oxygen

98
00:05:29,992 --> 00:05:31,983
at sea level of the atmosphere,

99
00:05:31,984 --> 00:05:34,339
which is only 0.2 bar.

100
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:38,391
But of course, it was
still a relatively low pressure

101
00:05:38,392 --> 00:05:42,998
and it necessitated
pre-breathing of pure oxygen

102
00:05:43,009 --> 00:05:48,024
before lowering the pressure
in the airlock to start the spacewalk.

103
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:52,897
Pre-breathing was necessary to eliminate
the nitrogen dissolved in the blood

104
00:05:52,898 --> 00:05:54,886
and avoid the bends.

105
00:05:55,697 --> 00:06:00,746
Again, you see the control unit
was on the chest of the astronauts,

106
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:05,526
and it allowed the crew member
to put various tools,

107
00:06:05,527 --> 00:06:08,365
or various equipments,
attached to him.

108
00:06:08,366 --> 00:06:12,071
And interesting detail: here you see
a so-called portable foot restraint.

109
00:06:12,752 --> 00:06:15,626
If we had to do a job spacewalking

110
00:06:15,627 --> 00:06:18,391
where both hands
were needed to do the job--

111
00:06:18,392 --> 00:06:20,808
we could not use one hand
to hold the structure,

112
00:06:20,809 --> 00:06:22,043
and the other to work--

113
00:06:22,044 --> 00:06:24,340
so then, we had to lock our feet somewhere

114
00:06:24,341 --> 00:06:26,277
and either they were locked
at the structure,

115
00:06:26,277 --> 00:06:29,307
like you saw in the picture
where I was on the previous video

116
00:06:29,698 --> 00:06:31,625
doing work in the payload bay,

117
00:06:31,626 --> 00:06:33,437
I could lock my feet in the payload bay

118
00:06:33,437 --> 00:06:34,946
and use both hands,

119
00:06:34,947 --> 00:06:37,240
but if this it was not possible,

120
00:06:37,241 --> 00:06:39,977
we had to take a portable foot restraint,

121
00:06:39,978 --> 00:06:42,393
installed it to the convenient location,

122
00:06:42,394 --> 00:06:44,174
and then we could lock our feet

123
00:06:44,174 --> 00:06:45,552
in that foot restraint,

124
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:49,417
and used then, both hands
and both arms to do the job.

125
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:53,926
Some details about
the control system for the suit.

126
00:06:53,927 --> 00:06:57,086
In fact, a space suit is
like a personal spacecraft, in a way,

127
00:06:57,087 --> 00:07:01,576
and you have to operate
the various systems

128
00:07:01,577 --> 00:07:04,999
using this display and control module,

129
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,586
which was on the chest,

130
00:07:06,586 --> 00:07:08,843
but that was not really directly visible,

131
00:07:08,843 --> 00:07:11,752
because you can only see
in front of you a little bit above,

132
00:07:11,752 --> 00:07:14,274
on the side, but you can't see down.

133
00:07:14,275 --> 00:07:16,272
We had a mirror

134
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:18,249
on the left wrist,

135
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:24,001
giving us a reflection
of what was on the DCM,

136
00:07:24,009 --> 00:07:27,246
and also, all of the numbers
and the letters here.

137
00:07:27,247 --> 00:07:31,761
You see they are all mirror-represented,

138
00:07:31,762 --> 00:07:34,019
letters and numbers,

139
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:37,806
because we saw this through
this mirror on the left wrist.

140
00:07:37,807 --> 00:07:40,202
Here you had the control
of the cooling,

141
00:07:40,203 --> 00:07:44,446
you could by-pass
some of the cooling system

142
00:07:44,447 --> 00:07:47,463
so as to get a warmer temperature
inside the suit;

143
00:07:47,464 --> 00:07:50,513
you have a control of the pressure
inside the suit;

144
00:07:50,514 --> 00:07:52,381
a display intensity control

145
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:54,801
and volume control for the radio.

146
00:07:54,802 --> 00:07:58,447
By the way, display: we had here
an alpha numeric display,

147
00:07:58,448 --> 00:08:01,349
a caution warning system,
informing us for instance,

148
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,706
about the deviation from normal pressure--

149
00:08:03,707 --> 00:08:07,703
I mentioned the 4.3. pounds per square inch,
the normal pressure of the oxygen;

150
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:10,513
but if the pressure was going
below a certain value,

151
00:08:10,514 --> 00:08:13,348
we had a caution warning,
acoustical warning,

152
00:08:13,349 --> 00:08:15,589
and we had the indication of the pressure.

153
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:18,704
Other parameters, like partial pressure
of carbon dioxide

154
00:08:18,705 --> 00:08:23,553
or voltage in the battery,
in the portable life support system,

155
00:08:23,554 --> 00:08:25,968
where indicated
on the caution warning system.

156
00:08:25,969 --> 00:08:27,804
And there were procedures

157
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:30,628
that were either voiced by the crew
on board of the Shuttle,

158
00:08:30,748 --> 00:08:33,248
or voice by the mission control center,

159
00:08:33,249 --> 00:08:34,653
the expert in EVA,

160
00:08:34,654 --> 00:08:38,752
or we had a little flip book
on our left wrist,

161
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:41,190
with the main emergency procedures,

162
00:08:41,191 --> 00:08:45,776
and this was all subject
of a training prior to going to space,

163
00:08:45,792 --> 00:08:48,134
and performing the EVAs.

164
00:08:48,135 --> 00:08:50,459
As far as mobility is concerned,

165
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:54,439
normally, there were two ways
of bringing an astronaut

166
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,739
to the place of work.

167
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,750
If the robotic arm
of the Shuttle was used,

168
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:00,618
then there was a platform
at the end of the robotic arm,

169
00:09:00,619 --> 00:09:04,746
and the astronaut in question
was brought to his place of work

170
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:07,660
by the robotic arm
operated inside the Shuttle.

171
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:11,210
Or, the other crew member
because there was only one robotic arm

172
00:09:11,211 --> 00:09:16,467
was himself or herself,
responsible for his or her displacement

173
00:09:16,468 --> 00:09:19,239
using hand rails along the fuselage.

174
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,159
Or, for instance, for Hubble,
on the surface of the telescope.

175
00:09:22,767 --> 00:09:25,331
But NASA, at some point,
decided to develop a system

176
00:09:25,331 --> 00:09:29,534
that allowed free mobility
of a spacewalking crew member,

177
00:09:29,534 --> 00:09:32,278
that's the Manned Maneuvering Unit,

178
00:09:32,278 --> 00:09:34,142
and the spacewalking crew member

179
00:09:34,142 --> 00:09:36,717
was just donning
the Manned Maneuvering Unit,

180
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:38,766
which was installed at payload bay,

181
00:09:38,766 --> 00:09:44,859
and had, classically, for his right hand,
the rotational hand controller,

182
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,178
and on his left hand,
the translation hand controller--

183
00:09:49,178 --> 00:09:52,729
this is is a classic, as well
for the Space Shuttle,

184
00:09:52,729 --> 00:09:56,011
for the robotic arm
or for the Manned Maneuvering Unit,

185
00:09:56,011 --> 00:10:00,112
it is always the same distribution
of a task: rotation on the right

186
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:03,689
and translation on the left,
which is pretty much like an airplane

187
00:10:03,689 --> 00:10:06,850
where you have, in a single seater plane

188
00:10:06,850 --> 00:10:10,057
you have the throttle
on the left-hand side,

189
00:10:10,057 --> 00:10:14,545
and rotation of the control stick
on the right-hand.

190
00:10:14,545 --> 00:10:17,414
Now, the Manned Maneuvering Unit,

191
00:10:17,414 --> 00:10:21,511
was loaded with a thruster system
called GAS thruster.

192
00:10:21,511 --> 00:10:23,569
It had a tank of cold nitrogen

193
00:10:23,569 --> 00:10:26,271
and you see here, some of the nozzles,

194
00:10:26,271 --> 00:10:31,056
allowing translation or rotation
according to the inputs that were made

195
00:10:31,056 --> 00:10:34,345
on the rotation or translation
hand controllers.

196
00:10:34,345 --> 00:10:37,290
So, this allowed the crew to move away
from the Space Shuttle,

197
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,265
maybe towards the satellite
to be rescued, totally autonomously,

198
00:10:41,265 --> 00:10:44,501
and without a safety tether
attached to the Shuttle.

199
00:10:45,521 --> 00:10:47,735
Some details on
the Manned Maneuvering Unit:

200
00:10:47,735 --> 00:10:51,710
this is a structure that was, in a way,

201
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:53,855
hosting the Manned Maneuvering Unit.

202
00:10:53,855 --> 00:10:56,122
It was located at the front fuselage

203
00:10:56,122 --> 00:11:00,491
on the port-side of the fuselage
closed to the forward bulk head,

204
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:05,553
and the Manned Maneuvering Unit
was attached to this structure.

205
00:11:05,553 --> 00:11:07,870
When the astronaut wanted to move away,

206
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,859
he had to detach
the Manned Maneuvering Unit

207
00:11:10,859 --> 00:11:12,777
from this holding structure.

208
00:11:13,077 --> 00:11:16,118
On the left-hand side, you see
the two controllers

209
00:11:16,118 --> 00:11:19,008
that allowed the rotation and translation,

210
00:11:19,008 --> 00:11:23,835
that were located to the end of these arms
that were just in the proper position

211
00:11:23,835 --> 00:11:26,794
for the right hand to the left hand
of the astronauts.

212
00:11:26,794 --> 00:11:30,022
In the bottom, you see,
it's in French here,

213
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:33,138
there's a lot of designation
of various features

214
00:11:33,138 --> 00:11:35,013
in the Manned Maneuvering Unit

215
00:11:35,013 --> 00:11:37,928
but again, the main
and interesting features

216
00:11:37,928 --> 00:11:42,348
are really the thruster control--
they are up here--

217
00:11:42,348 --> 00:11:44,422
of course they were in the back also,

218
00:11:44,422 --> 00:11:46,781
and on the other side,
on the right-hand side.

219
00:11:46,781 --> 00:11:50,338
In order to do a full control
and rotation and translation

220
00:11:50,338 --> 00:11:51,963
of the Manned Maneuvering Unit.

221
00:11:52,563 --> 00:11:55,401
There were only a few missions
where the Manned Maneuvering Unit

222
00:11:55,401 --> 00:11:56,829
was practically used,

223
00:11:56,829 --> 00:11:59,422
but one rather famous mission

224
00:11:59,422 --> 00:12:02,234
was the mission 51A in November 1984,

225
00:12:02,234 --> 00:12:07,732
when astronauts with the Shuttle
deployed two satellites,

226
00:12:07,732 --> 00:12:10,099
two communication satellites,
on one hand,

227
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:13,878
and then recovered two malfunctioning 
communication satellites,

228
00:12:13,878 --> 00:12:18,533
and here you see one of the astronauts
in the Manned Maneuvering Unit,

229
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:20,961
not tethered to the Space Shuttle.

230
00:12:20,961 --> 00:12:24,620
With a special system called the Stinger,

231
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,866
that allowed him to approach
the slowly rotating satellite

232
00:12:27,866 --> 00:12:31,279
and so, the Stinger into
the satellite itself,

233
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,721
and that part is uncovered here,

234
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,982
the both of the cylinder,

235
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:42,009
and then he could use the thruster system
of his Manned Maneuvering Unit

236
00:12:42,009 --> 00:12:44,479
in order to slow down the rotation
of the satellite,

237
00:12:44,479 --> 00:12:47,179
then the satellite was brought
to the payload bay of the Shuttle,

238
00:12:47,179 --> 00:12:50,025
was recovered
and was brought back down to Earth.

239
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:52,775
So this is
an interesting practical utilization

240
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:54,514
of the Manned Maneuvering Unit.

241
00:12:56,054 --> 00:12:58,976
After few Shuttle flights
with practically re-utilization

242
00:12:58,976 --> 00:13:00,676
of the Manned Maneuvering Unit,

243
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:02,257
it became clear however

244
00:13:02,257 --> 00:13:07,390
that the bulky spaceship, in a way,
personal spaceship,

245
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,171
was not going to be very useful
for a practical application

246
00:13:11,171 --> 00:13:13,871
like servicing
the Hubble Space Telescope

247
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:16,992
or assembly
of the International Space Station.

248
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:18,902
So the project was abandoned,

249
00:13:18,902 --> 00:13:21,188
although it was
technically, really interesting;

250
00:13:21,188 --> 00:13:22,784
it had great capabilities,

251
00:13:22,784 --> 00:13:25,180
and operationally, it was
quite interesting also,

252
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,889
but it was abandoned.

253
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,422
What it was developed however

254
00:13:28,422 --> 00:13:31,752
is kind of a baby
of the Manned Maneuvering Unit,

255
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:34,904
that it's called
Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue.

256
00:13:34,904 --> 00:13:36,976
The idea was the following:

257
00:13:36,976 --> 00:13:40,515
if you do a spacewalk
from the Space Shuttle,

258
00:13:41,145 --> 00:13:43,453
and normally you hold the structure,

259
00:13:44,463 --> 00:13:46,886
or you are on a portable foot restraint,

260
00:13:46,886 --> 00:13:48,845
or somehow, you are restrained,

261
00:13:48,845 --> 00:13:53,458
or you are possibly at the end
of the robotic arm on a holding platform,

262
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,797
and then you have your safety tether;

263
00:13:56,797 --> 00:13:59,766
so, in case you don't hold
the structure anymore,

264
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:03,686
you have the safety tether
to come back to the spaceship.

265
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:05,438
Now, in the case of the Shuttle,

266
00:14:05,438 --> 00:14:07,448
in case you are not holding the structure,

267
00:14:07,448 --> 00:14:09,899
and your safety tether
was not attached properly,

268
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,252
you would just drift away
from the Shuttle,

269
00:14:12,252 --> 00:14:14,768
but the Shuttle had
maneuvering capabilities

270
00:14:14,768 --> 00:14:16,755
and could come and rescue you.

271
00:14:16,755 --> 00:14:20,209
Normally, we were always two persons
doing the spacewalk,

272
00:14:20,209 --> 00:14:23,058
so one of them maybe
would be floating away,

273
00:14:23,058 --> 00:14:26,746
the Commander of the Shuttle,
or the pilot, would move the Shuttle,

274
00:14:26,746 --> 00:14:28,845
so that the other crew member,

275
00:14:28,845 --> 00:14:31,349
still attached with this safety tether
at the payload bay

276
00:14:31,349 --> 00:14:34,583
could grab his colleague
attached to the safety tether.

277
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:40,562
And we had a third way of rescuing
the spacewalking crew member this way.

278
00:14:40,562 --> 00:14:42,350
Again, holding the structure is one way,

279
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:44,366
safety tether is another way,

280
00:14:44,366 --> 00:14:46,611
the third way was motion
of the Space Shuttle

281
00:14:46,611 --> 00:14:49,332
towards the astronaut to be rescued.

282
00:14:50,252 --> 00:14:53,642
For the International Space Station
it is not possible,

283
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:56,940
because the ISS can, of course,
control its orientation,

284
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:59,346
its altitude, but it cannot translate.

285
00:14:59,346 --> 00:15:04,563
So if we had a spacewalking astronaut
in the vicinity of the Space Shuttle,

286
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:06,428
suddenly detached from the structure,

287
00:15:06,428 --> 00:15:08,820
and the safety tether not safely attached,

288
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:10,989
there would be no other way.

289
00:15:10,989 --> 00:15:15,182
In order to bring that third way,
rescuing the astronaut in this situation,

290
00:15:15,182 --> 00:15:19,521
NASA developed
the Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue.

291
00:15:19,521 --> 00:15:24,524
It's a mini Manned Maneuvering Unit,
but it would only allow

292
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,053
the possibility for the crew member
to come back to the station

293
00:15:28,053 --> 00:15:30,663
after being detached inadvertently.

294
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,673
And here you see,
it had to be attached

295
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:36,239
to the life support system in the back,

296
00:15:36,239 --> 00:15:40,570
and it had cold GAS thrusters, we see
some of the nozzles here, and there,

297
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:45,064
enough nozzles to do a full control
of the rotation and translation

298
00:15:45,064 --> 00:15:48,744
and it had also an altitude hold,
inertial altitude hold mode;

299
00:15:48,744 --> 00:15:52,742
and you could select
all of these on this little control unit

300
00:15:52,742 --> 00:15:54,729
which you had here,
which you had to deploy

301
00:15:54,729 --> 00:15:57,745
in case you were in the situation
floating away.

302
00:15:57,745 --> 00:16:01,847
Here you see an ISS spacewalking astronaut

303
00:16:01,847 --> 00:16:05,097
with this extension
of the portable life support system

304
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:07,059
which was a SAFER itself.

305
00:16:07,059 --> 00:16:10,966
And again, it was carried 
on all of the Shuttle missions

306
00:16:10,966 --> 00:16:13,835
for assembly
at the International Space Station

307
00:16:13,835 --> 00:16:18,312
and for all the International Space
Station-based spacewalk

308
00:16:18,312 --> 00:16:20,641
out of the US-airlock;

309
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:23,122
all the crew members
had the SAFER installed

310
00:16:23,122 --> 00:16:25,863
on their portable life support system.

311
00:16:25,863 --> 00:16:28,389
Here we see the preparation
of a spacewalk

312
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:32,671
by two astronauts,
European Space Agency astronauts,

313
00:16:32,671 --> 00:16:37,071
Luca Parmitano from Italy,
and Chris Cassidy, NASA astronaut,

314
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:39,257
inside the ISS airlock.

315
00:16:39,257 --> 00:16:44,744
And if we look from left to right,
and top to bottom,

316
00:16:45,174 --> 00:16:49,723
here we see Luca Parmitano
in the so-called LCVG,

317
00:16:49,723 --> 00:16:52,503
Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment.

318
00:16:52,503 --> 00:16:56,897
It's an undergarment
that all spacewalking astronauts have

319
00:16:56,897 --> 00:17:02,491
and the suit itself is filled
with little plastic tubes,

320
00:17:02,491 --> 00:17:04,446
filled themselves with water;

321
00:17:04,446 --> 00:17:06,418
the water is put in circulation
with a pump,

322
00:17:06,418 --> 00:17:10,009
and it goes through a sublimator
that cools down the water

323
00:17:10,009 --> 00:17:13,578
and can regulate
the temperature of the body

324
00:17:13,578 --> 00:17:17,737
and eliminates the metabolic heat
inside the space suit.

325
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:20,734
And these parts here
are the ventilation garment

326
00:17:20,734 --> 00:17:24,672
that ventilate oxygen inside the suit.

327
00:17:24,672 --> 00:17:29,338
And you see both of the spacesuits
are installed on the wall.

328
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:33,527
Here you'll still have the pants,
in the bottom,

329
00:17:33,527 --> 00:17:36,714
and you have these so-called
hard upper torso

330
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:38,770
that it's fixed against the wall.

331
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:42,386
And what the crew members have to do--

332
00:17:42,386 --> 00:17:47,498
here you see Luca that just removed
the trousers and put them on himself--

333
00:17:47,838 --> 00:17:52,197
and he is getting ready to come
into the hard upper torso from the bottom,

334
00:17:52,197 --> 00:17:54,207
and this is the difficult part.

335
00:17:54,207 --> 00:17:57,432
You have to come from the bottom,
and extend your arms upwards,

336
00:17:57,432 --> 00:18:02,565
and put your arms
inside the suit arms themselves

337
00:18:02,565 --> 00:18:07,122
and then put your arms down
when your head goes through the top,

338
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:10,027
the ring here,
which you see on this picture.

339
00:18:10,027 --> 00:18:12,796
That's the next step of preparation;

340
00:18:12,796 --> 00:18:15,676
you see Chris Cassidy
doing the same thing here,

341
00:18:15,676 --> 00:18:18,000
on the left-hand side.

342
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,134
Let’s look in the lower left picture.

343
00:18:22,264 --> 00:18:26,037
Now you have the gloves being installed,
for both crew members,

344
00:18:26,037 --> 00:18:28,172
and you have the helmets,

345
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:32,108
so the crew members are ready then

346
00:18:32,108 --> 00:18:35,277
to do the functional check
of the spacesuits

347
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:40,880
before closing the inner hatch
of the airlock, evacuating the airlock,

348
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,103
and doing their sortie.

349
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:45,329
This is Orlan spacesuit,

350
00:18:45,329 --> 00:18:48,142
developed by the Soviets first,
and then the Russians,

351
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:51,765
and there were several steps
in the development of this suit.

352
00:18:51,765 --> 00:18:56,741
It has a somehow higher pressure
of pure oxygen inside the suit,

353
00:18:56,981 --> 00:18:59,089
5.7. pounds per square inch,

354
00:18:59,089 --> 00:19:03,668
versus 4.3 for the NASA EMU.

355
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:06,590
One advantage of the Orlan spacesuit

356
00:19:06,590 --> 00:19:08,950
is that it's easier to get in.

357
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:13,099
I described before the difficult way
to get in the EMU,

358
00:19:13,099 --> 00:19:15,021
with the different steps,

359
00:19:15,021 --> 00:19:19,591
and the difficult step being
to come inside the hard upper torso

360
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,235
from below,

361
00:19:21,235 --> 00:19:23,630
but here the crew member
just jumps in the suit,

362
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,445
it's much more rapid than with the EMU,

363
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,046
putting his or her feet down

364
00:19:29,046 --> 00:19:32,636
and then, closing the "door" in the back,

365
00:19:32,636 --> 00:19:35,225
in this door, you have all the systems,

366
00:19:35,225 --> 00:19:38,439
like the supply of oxygen,

367
00:19:38,439 --> 00:19:40,873
the moisture separator,

368
00:19:40,873 --> 00:19:43,680
the cartridge to remove
the carbon dioxide,

369
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,003
and all of the systems are in the door,

370
00:19:46,003 --> 00:19:48,549
which you close behind you
with the help of somebody.

371
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:52,735
This is a nice picture of an astronaut
doing a spacewalk

372
00:19:52,735 --> 00:19:55,025
outside of the International 
Space Station,

373
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:57,346
with the Orlan Russian spacesuit.

374
00:19:58,226 --> 00:20:00,117
There is an interesting detail:

375
00:20:00,117 --> 00:20:01,828
here you see the mirror,

376
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:05,313
on the left wrist of the cosmonaut,

377
00:20:05,313 --> 00:20:07,462
pretty much like in the US.

378
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:09,541
There are a lot of solutions
that had been--

379
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,320
that are common

380
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:14,215
to the EMU and the Orlan suit,

381
00:20:14,215 --> 00:20:15,733
and this is the case.

382
00:20:15,733 --> 00:20:19,471
Also for this mirror, that allows
the crew member to see the wording,

383
00:20:19,471 --> 00:20:23,728
which is mirror-reversed on the front part
which is not visible

384
00:20:23,728 --> 00:20:25,478
by the astronaut.

385
00:20:25,478 --> 00:20:30,351
Most of the spacewalks were
spacewalks using the EMU

386
00:20:30,351 --> 00:20:32,793
for the assembly
of the International Space Station,

387
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:36,279
but on a regular basis we have
cosmonauts doing spacewalks

388
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:38,040
mainly in conjunction

389
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:40,848
with the health status
of the Russian segment

390
00:20:40,848 --> 00:20:43,195
of the International Space Station,

391
00:20:43,195 --> 00:20:44,734
and using the Orlan spacesuit,

392
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:46,276
which is a very successful suit.

393
00:20:46,276 --> 00:20:48,135
By the way, you see also here,

394
00:20:48,135 --> 00:20:49,801
the lights of the flash light

395
00:20:49,801 --> 00:20:51,670
allowing the illumination
of the place of work

396
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:52,813
during the orbital night,

397
00:20:52,813 --> 00:20:55,100
and you have a small back hole

398
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,021
which are cameras, in fact.

399
00:20:57,021 --> 00:20:58,871
You have the same in the EMU.
