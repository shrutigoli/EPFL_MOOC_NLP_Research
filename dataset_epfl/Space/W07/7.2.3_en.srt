1
00:00:05,686 --> 00:00:08,306
In this video,
I will show you and describe

2
00:00:08,321 --> 00:00:11,351
some pictures that were taken
during my own spacewalk

3
00:00:11,389 --> 00:00:15,279
together with Mike Foale,
EVA no. 2 of STS-103

4
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:18,155
on December 23, 1999.

5
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:19,907
Then I'll show some pictures

6
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:23,687
of spacewalks that were needed
for Space Station assembly

7
00:00:23,725 --> 00:00:27,335
and recent spacewalks
for Space Station maintenance

8
00:00:27,335 --> 00:00:28,725
done by Russians.

9
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:31,050
I'll also show you
some pictures of training,

10
00:00:31,116 --> 00:00:35,406
in-water training
preparing for spacewalks.

11
00:00:35,424 --> 00:00:39,804
At the end there will be
some numbers for records

12
00:00:39,843 --> 00:00:45,922
and statistics of spacewalks
from the Space Shuttle and the ISS.

13
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:51,322
And also previous records prior to
the Space Shuttle and ISS programs.

14
00:00:51,358 --> 00:00:54,038
Here you see training in the
Neutral Buoyancy Lab

15
00:00:54,058 --> 00:00:55,736
at the Johnson Space Center.

16
00:00:55,736 --> 00:01:01,356
This is training for my mission,
STS-103 in December 1999.

17
00:01:01,374 --> 00:01:06,504
We had a very high fidelity model
of the telescope immersed in the water.

18
00:01:06,532 --> 00:01:09,406
We had the robotic arm
which you see here.

19
00:01:09,406 --> 00:01:11,466
This is the payload bay of the Shuttle.

20
00:01:11,483 --> 00:01:13,423
We also had the airlock of the Shuttle.

21
00:01:13,423 --> 00:01:16,988
We could exercise different motions
and also the tether protocol

22
00:01:17,008 --> 00:01:19,778
which you really have to rehearse

23
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,530
and be sure that you do
the right thing with the tethers.

24
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,257
There are two of us.

25
00:01:27,257 --> 00:01:30,933
One of us is on a platform
at the end of the robotic arm

26
00:01:30,933 --> 00:01:33,288
but still attached to the arm
with a safety tether

27
00:01:33,288 --> 00:01:35,958
and the other one
is getting inside the telescope

28
00:01:35,973 --> 00:01:37,448
after opening the doors

29
00:01:37,448 --> 00:01:40,422
giving access to the instrument part
of the telescope.

30
00:01:40,422 --> 00:01:43,812
Of course there are divers
and there are bubbles everywhere,

31
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:47,828
but the water environment is 
really an excellent training environment

32
00:01:47,828 --> 00:01:49,608
for spacewalks.

33
00:01:49,608 --> 00:01:53,949
If you are properly neutralized
in terms of having

34
00:01:53,949 --> 00:01:57,191
no part of your body going up
and another going down,

35
00:01:57,191 --> 00:02:00,241
but you are really
like in weightlessness.

36
00:02:00,255 --> 00:02:03,971
Of course, you just have gravity
on your body inside the suit.

37
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:07,989
So if you are head down in the NBL,

38
00:02:07,989 --> 00:02:10,299
you are going to feel a lot of blood
going into your head

39
00:02:10,299 --> 00:02:12,329
which of course doesn't happen in space.

40
00:02:12,362 --> 00:02:17,362
So that's the only pretty severe deviation
from the situation in space.

41
00:02:17,384 --> 00:02:19,364
You still have gravity on your body

42
00:02:19,377 --> 00:02:23,037
and as long as you have your feet down
and your head up it's OK.

43
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:26,495
If you have your head down, it's OK
for 10 minutes, maybe half an hour

44
00:02:26,495 --> 00:02:28,835
but you don't want to spend
many hours like this.

45
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:32,855
This illustrates inside the Shuttle,
where the volume is really small

46
00:02:32,855 --> 00:02:35,035
compared to the 
International Space Station,

47
00:02:35,035 --> 00:02:37,188
in preparation for spacewalk number two

48
00:02:37,188 --> 00:02:42,108
which I accomplished 
with Mike Foale in December 1999.

49
00:02:43,202 --> 00:02:47,188
This is in the mid-deck, 
and mid-deck is relatively small,

50
00:02:47,188 --> 00:02:49,276
and we had
seven crew members on board,

51
00:02:49,276 --> 00:02:52,286
some of them were sometimes
on the flight deck, on the mid-deck,

52
00:02:52,334 --> 00:02:57,164
and we had the pants of our space suits
that were floating in the mid-deck

53
00:02:57,185 --> 00:02:59,770
and the hard upper torso
was of course in the airlock,

54
00:02:59,770 --> 00:03:01,820
fixed against the wall
as we saw before.

55
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,570
It was pretty much the same

56
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:06,220
for the Shuttle 
as for the International Space Station,

57
00:03:06,245 --> 00:03:08,625
the hard upper torso
was always fixed to the wall.

58
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:12,617
Here you see a lot of equipment,
for instance the floodlights,

59
00:03:12,637 --> 00:03:15,807
you see one here, the other one there,
and there's one glove here,

60
00:03:15,841 --> 00:03:19,981
different equipment that we had to prepare
in order to do a spacewalk.

61
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:24,681
We had a clear checklist of the tools
we had to take for every single spacewalk

62
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:28,018
because some tasks required special tools

63
00:03:28,028 --> 00:03:30,398
which we had to take out in the airlock

64
00:03:31,421 --> 00:03:34,001
and then take out spacewalking.

65
00:03:34,015 --> 00:03:36,702
We could not allow ourselves
to make any mistakes there,

66
00:03:36,702 --> 00:03:38,972
you had to take
the right tools to do the task.

67
00:03:39,289 --> 00:03:42,519
This is the first part 
of spacewalk number two.

68
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:46,491
I was one of the crew members there,
in fact I'm here, in the forefront.

69
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,530
I was the so-called
free floater at that time.

70
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,870
Mike Foale, my colleague,
as you see

71
00:03:51,892 --> 00:03:54,432
is on the platform
at the end of the robotic arm,

72
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:58,712
brought to his place of work by the
robotic arm operator inside the Shuttle.

73
00:03:58,742 --> 00:04:03,042
I have my safety tether, you can see
it's attached here to my waist

74
00:04:03,061 --> 00:04:07,370
and it's towed here 
towards a small cylinder

75
00:04:07,370 --> 00:04:09,300
that could go along a cable

76
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:15,040
along the starboard sill
of the payload bay of the Shuttle.

77
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,894
And we opened 
the avionic bay door number one

78
00:04:17,894 --> 00:04:19,494
to give us access

79
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:22,804
to the main computer of Hubble
that had to be exchanged.

80
00:04:22,834 --> 00:04:27,844
Now, you see I am holding myself
just at the rim of the door

81
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:31,340
and I have my safety tether
so I have two ways of being safe.

82
00:04:31,342 --> 00:04:34,442
If I had detached my safety tether

83
00:04:34,464 --> 00:04:37,314
-- just a thought experiment,
I wouldn't do that --

84
00:04:37,326 --> 00:04:39,276
and if I had detached myself,

85
00:04:39,304 --> 00:04:41,574
then I would have drifted away
on my own orbit.

86
00:04:41,592 --> 00:04:43,502
Then the third way to rescue me

87
00:04:43,502 --> 00:04:47,222
would have been for the Shuttle
to come and get me.

88
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:49,870
It's never happened
on any Shuttle mission

89
00:04:49,899 --> 00:04:52,429
to have this third way being used

90
00:04:52,442 --> 00:04:54,732
to move the Shuttle
to rescue an astronaut.

91
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:56,622
But there was always
that possibility.

92
00:04:57,438 --> 00:04:59,108
At the end of the spacewalk,

93
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:02,897
after we installed 
the new fine guidance sensor number two,

94
00:05:02,918 --> 00:05:06,198
I was on that platform
at the end of the robotic arm,

95
00:05:06,198 --> 00:05:08,598
we had changed positions
with Mike Foale.

96
00:05:08,598 --> 00:05:13,845
And this is close to the end, I took
some pictures with a Nikon camera

97
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:19,316
covered with a white protective cover,
a thermal cover for the camera.

98
00:05:19,316 --> 00:05:23,234
You see there is 
a small tether for the camera.

99
00:05:23,234 --> 00:05:26,454
And you see the tools here,
this is a kind of open toolbox

100
00:05:26,454 --> 00:05:30,401
with a power tool, the pistol grip tool,
and many other tools.

101
00:05:30,432 --> 00:05:34,802
And all the tools that we had
were attached with safety tethers

102
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,049
because if you don't have
safety tethers on astronauts,

103
00:05:38,049 --> 00:05:39,329
you lose astronauts

104
00:05:39,356 --> 00:05:42,220
and if you don't have them
for other equipment,

105
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:43,470
you lose that equipment,

106
00:05:43,504 --> 00:05:46,634
and if you don't have them on tools,
you may very well lose tools.

107
00:05:46,653 --> 00:05:52,183
At that time, that was in 1999,
we didn't have cameras on our helmets.

108
00:05:52,205 --> 00:05:55,175
Since that time, of course,
cameras have been installed,

109
00:05:55,192 --> 00:05:58,592
small cameras on the helmet,
even several cameras on each helmet,

110
00:05:58,626 --> 00:06:01,402
so we had a big TV camera here
that we had to use

111
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:05,452
in order to show the ground team
in the mission control center,

112
00:06:05,452 --> 00:06:06,852
the work that we had done.

113
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,698
Well, that was 
a Hubble-related spacewalk.

114
00:06:09,698 --> 00:06:12,868
Now we're going to look into
an ISS assembly spacewalk.

115
00:06:12,921 --> 00:06:17,121
This is one step of the assembly
of the International Space Station

116
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,969
where an element was brought
to the end of the port truss of ISS.

117
00:06:22,981 --> 00:06:26,401
You see here the solar arrays
not yet deployed

118
00:06:26,421 --> 00:06:28,991
which are towards the end
of the port truss,

119
00:06:29,062 --> 00:06:34,012
and the attachment 
of a new element of structure to ISS

120
00:06:34,052 --> 00:06:38,342
on the US OS segment, the US segment,
not the Russian segment,

121
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:42,720
was basically bringing the new equipment
in the cargo bay of the Shuttle,

122
00:06:42,757 --> 00:06:46,657
open cargo bay doors--
of course, they were opened already

123
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:49,137
at the beginning of the Shuttle mission,

124
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:52,389
even before the rendezvous
with the International Space Station.

125
00:06:53,203 --> 00:06:58,013
Then the element was removed
with the Shuttle robotic arm

126
00:06:58,028 --> 00:07:00,768
and handed over 
to the Station robotic arm,

127
00:07:00,784 --> 00:07:04,624
and then brought into place
by the Station robotic arm--

128
00:07:04,642 --> 00:07:07,182
which by the way you see here--

129
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:13,570
and then a spacewalking astronaut
with tools was attaching and securing

130
00:07:13,587 --> 00:07:17,417
the new element to the existing part
of the International Space Station.

131
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:19,695
Here you have
two spacewalking astronauts,

132
00:07:19,715 --> 00:07:23,895
we see one here with his portable
life support system and his shoes.

133
00:07:23,929 --> 00:07:27,519
There is another one here, less visible,
but there is another one there,

134
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:33,519
both working towards the goal
of attaching that new segment to ISS.

135
00:07:33,922 --> 00:07:40,192
By the way, 
we are flying over Turkey here,

136
00:07:40,204 --> 00:07:44,484
and this is the Aegean Sea of Greece

137
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:48,441
with some of the Greek islands visible
on the right-hand side of the picture.

138
00:07:48,987 --> 00:07:52,447
These are two nice pictures
taken during ISS assembly.

139
00:07:52,489 --> 00:07:54,799
The one on the right-hand side
is quite nice

140
00:07:54,799 --> 00:07:56,847
because you see
the background of the Earth

141
00:07:56,847 --> 00:07:59,388
about 350 kilometers
below the astronaut.

142
00:07:59,388 --> 00:08:03,048
Of course, you see the safety tether
properly attached here.

143
00:08:03,873 --> 00:08:08,073
Again, hold the structure, have
your safety tether always attached,

144
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:12,267
and if, for one reason or another,
both of these are not satisfied,

145
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:15,667
then, in this particular case,
you have the SAFER system here

146
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:20,380
with the little nozzles which we see here
attached to the astronaut,

147
00:08:20,417 --> 00:08:23,927
and that's going to be the way
he or she can be rescued.

148
00:08:25,875 --> 00:08:31,555
On the right hand side, a nice view
of two spacewalking astronauts.

149
00:08:32,214 --> 00:08:38,434
This was before the completion
of the assembly of the starboard truss,

150
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:41,959
with a nice view in the background,
again 350 kilometers below.

151
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:45,189
Space Station assembly was one thing,

152
00:08:45,202 --> 00:08:48,492
for spacewalkers, there was also
Space Station maintenance,

153
00:08:48,525 --> 00:08:53,605
to change tanks, for instance,
or other components;

154
00:08:53,964 --> 00:08:59,514
and there was, on a few occasions,
Space Station repair that was necessary.

155
00:08:59,553 --> 00:09:04,263
Here you see a definite tear
on the large solar array

156
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,579
and in November 2007,
we had Scott Parazynski here

157
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,840
on a small platform at the end
of the Space Station robotic arm,

158
00:09:14,859 --> 00:09:17,299
which you see here,
brought to the place of work

159
00:09:17,309 --> 00:09:19,849
in order to do the repair
of the damaged solar array.

160
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:25,363
I've shown pictures of training
for Hubble repair missions

161
00:09:25,406 --> 00:09:29,696
using the NBL with
a high fidelity model of the telescope.

162
00:09:29,748 --> 00:09:31,778
Of course, this is no longer current now,

163
00:09:31,788 --> 00:09:36,368
but the NBL is used constantly
for training of astronauts

164
00:09:36,393 --> 00:09:39,553
in view of spacewalks
related to the Space Station,

165
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:42,411
not assembly any more
but space station maintenance.

166
00:09:42,465 --> 00:09:47,035
Here you have Peggy Whitson,
an American NASA astronaut,

167
00:09:47,075 --> 00:09:51,985
who was commander of ISS
over six months, a couple of years ago,

168
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:55,085
and here you see her
in training in the NBL

169
00:09:55,214 --> 00:10:01,274
in view of expedition 50/51
which should start at the end of 2016.

170
00:10:02,243 --> 00:10:04,763
You also see again the safety tether.

171
00:10:04,795 --> 00:10:07,015
All the tether protocol
and tether attachment,

172
00:10:07,035 --> 00:10:09,545
although not needed in the pool,
for safety reasons,

173
00:10:09,594 --> 00:10:12,274
are practiced rigorously in the NBL.

174
00:10:12,319 --> 00:10:17,639
You also see the mini workstation
loaded with equipment in front of Peggy.

175
00:10:18,513 --> 00:10:22,490
This is a picture of a recent spacewalk
done by two Russian cosmonauts,

176
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:27,300
Malenchenko and Sergey Volkov
in February 2016.

177
00:10:27,344 --> 00:10:31,344
They were wearing the Orlan space suit
for this spacewalk,

178
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:33,845
which is the case 
for all of the Russian spacewalks.

179
00:10:33,845 --> 00:10:37,475
This is a pretty large
portable life support system

180
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:38,653
of the Orlan,

181
00:10:38,653 --> 00:10:43,023
which is a distinction of the geometry
of the Orlan versus the EMU.

182
00:10:43,913 --> 00:10:46,493
Some statistics related to spacewalking.

183
00:10:47,109 --> 00:10:51,829
Anatoly Solovyev, a Russian,
has the record for the most EVAs,

184
00:10:51,891 --> 00:10:54,831
16 in total, and a total time
of more than 82 hours.

185
00:10:55,138 --> 00:10:58,028
On the US side, you have
Michael Lopez-Alegria,

186
00:10:58,063 --> 00:11:01,273
10 spacewalks for 67 hours,

187
00:11:01,338 --> 00:11:04,048
and Christer Fuglesang
of the European Space Agency

188
00:11:04,104 --> 00:11:08,764
had 5 spacewalks and more than 30 hours
of total spacewalking time,

189
00:11:08,795 --> 00:11:12,155
and that's a record that will stay
for a while, it's quite a long time.

190
00:11:13,102 --> 00:11:16,442
These are the EVA statistics,
quite interesting numbers,

191
00:11:16,487 --> 00:11:18,627
I won't go into all of them, obviously.

192
00:11:18,689 --> 00:11:21,999
You had the first short spacewalk
of Alexei Leonov,

193
00:11:22,073 --> 00:11:25,673
which I mentioned already, in 1965.

194
00:11:25,673 --> 00:11:29,273
Let's look at the numbers,
of the total number of spacewalks.

195
00:11:29,273 --> 00:11:33,453
For the Shuttle, 131;
and for ISS, close to 200.

196
00:11:33,453 --> 00:11:36,821
Of course, a number 
of these Space Shuttle spacewalks

197
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,484
were related to ISS
so these are counted two times.

198
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:44,280
The Shuttle spacewalks
for Space Station assembly

199
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,180
are counted under Space Shuttle
as well as under ISS.

200
00:11:47,221 --> 00:11:49,641
We see that spacewalking has been

201
00:11:49,641 --> 00:11:53,401
an extremely useful capability
in human space flight.

202
00:11:53,444 --> 00:11:56,024
Without spacewalking,
no Hubble maintenance,

203
00:11:56,089 --> 00:11:57,849
no Space Station assembly.

204
00:11:57,849 --> 00:11:59,709
It's really an essential tool.
