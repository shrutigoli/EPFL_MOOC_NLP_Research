1
00:00:07,292 --> 00:00:09,126
My name is Harry van Hulten,

2
00:00:09,158 --> 00:00:11,790
I'm currently the Director
of Flight Test Operations

3
00:00:11,918 --> 00:00:14,419
at XCOR Aerospace
in Mojave, California.

4
00:00:18,573 --> 00:00:22,162
XCOR Aerospace is still considered

5
00:00:22,163 --> 00:00:26,162
a startup company
in the commercial space industry.

6
00:00:26,163 --> 00:00:32,052
The core technology that we develop
is new rocket propulsion, engines,

7
00:00:33,093 --> 00:00:36,762
propulsion systems,
and in addition to that

8
00:00:36,763 --> 00:00:41,253
we develop a suborbital,
reusable, commercial vehicle,

9
00:00:41,773 --> 00:00:45,823
and hopefully, put that
into flight test operations soon.

10
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:52,441
The specifications of the Lynx spacecraft

11
00:00:52,669 --> 00:00:55,649
it's going to be used
for suborbital operations,

12
00:00:56,014 --> 00:01:01,324
so the goal is to reach
100 kilometers or 300,000 feet per flight.

13
00:01:02,304 --> 00:01:03,834
It seats two people,

14
00:01:04,158 --> 00:01:06,278
so it'll be the pilot on the left,

15
00:01:06,402 --> 00:01:09,481
and a spaceflight participant
on the right,

16
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:11,345
whether there is a space tourist

17
00:01:11,346 --> 00:01:16,050
or a mission specialist
executing a specific mission,

18
00:01:16,051 --> 00:01:18,552
it's up to the client.

19
00:01:18,553 --> 00:01:25,549
The Lynx is propelled by four,
newly developed rocket engines

20
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:27,875
by XCOR Aerospace.

21
00:01:27,876 --> 00:01:30,460
These are reignitable and reusable,

22
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:33,562
they are designed to last
for 5,000 flights.

23
00:01:33,563 --> 00:01:37,530
And the Lynx is going to operate
from a regular runway,

24
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:41,341
so with that, we will bring
the space a lot closer

25
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:44,653
to a lot of people on this planet.

26
00:01:49,787 --> 00:01:53,203
Well, the most important feature
of the Lynx, first of all,

27
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:54,408
is propulsion.

28
00:01:54,409 --> 00:01:58,280
It's reusable,
reignitable rocket technology,

29
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:04,114
so the engines are developed
to be reused

30
00:02:04,115 --> 00:02:06,225
for about 5,000 flights;

31
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,523
it's the design criteria.

32
00:02:08,524 --> 00:02:12,494
And we made them reignitable,

33
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:15,535
so we can start the engines,
stop the engines, start them.

34
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:16,805
There is four of them,

35
00:02:17,736 --> 00:02:19,590
that propel the Lynx,

36
00:02:19,591 --> 00:02:23,279
and by the fact that they are
reusable and reignitable,

37
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,229
it starts to look like
aircraft-type operations,

38
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,421
or commercial aircraft-type operations.

39
00:02:29,422 --> 00:02:32,239
So that is the first big innovation;

40
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,897
second big innovation is,
we are going to take off on land,

41
00:02:34,907 --> 00:02:35,928
on a regular runway,

42
00:02:35,929 --> 00:02:39,975
so we are going to use
a currently regular airfield, if you will.

43
00:02:39,976 --> 00:02:44,101
Obviously, we need specific licenses
to do commercial space operations,

44
00:02:44,402 --> 00:02:47,203
so we'll turn it literally
into a spaceport.

45
00:02:47,204 --> 00:02:49,639
But it doesn't require
extra infrastructure

46
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:52,560
for the location itself.

47
00:02:53,598 --> 00:02:58,919
And we are going to fly
into commercial suborbital space,

48
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,797
up to four times a day,

49
00:03:00,797 --> 00:03:06,711
so that is, I think,
the most innovation step

50
00:03:06,711 --> 00:03:09,091
we'll bring to the table by the Lynx.

51
00:03:14,197 --> 00:03:15,972
For which purpose?

52
00:03:15,973 --> 00:03:17,625
What I think it's a strength

53
00:03:17,626 --> 00:03:20,429
that we have a multi-mission ship--
as we call it--

54
00:03:20,429 --> 00:03:26,515
so it can fly suborbital payloads
and people,

55
00:03:26,516 --> 00:03:29,030
people meaning special participants

56
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,002
whether those are commercial tourists

57
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:35,906
or a mission specialist
executing a scientific mission

58
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:37,755
it's up to the client.

59
00:03:38,046 --> 00:03:42,436
We also have room
in the back of the fuselage

60
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:44,973
where we can take sensors with us,

61
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:47,151
that we can either retain
for the whole flight

62
00:03:47,151 --> 00:03:50,114
or expand with the spring system
during the weightless phase.

63
00:03:51,065 --> 00:03:53,925
And those sensors then
make their own way back to Earth

64
00:03:53,925 --> 00:03:55,974
by a parachute or a balloon,

65
00:03:55,974 --> 00:03:57,881
and they follow on development:

66
00:03:57,881 --> 00:04:01,518
is to develop a cargo, or payload bay

67
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,055
on top of the fuselage,

68
00:04:03,055 --> 00:04:05,431
where we can house larger systems,

69
00:04:05,432 --> 00:04:09,511
and those systems can weigh
up to 650 kilograms,

70
00:04:09,512 --> 00:04:11,310
and it could either be

71
00:04:11,310 --> 00:04:13,936
a telescope that we use
while we're outside of the atmosphere

72
00:04:13,936 --> 00:04:17,181
or ultimately we could launch
small satellites.

73
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:22,177
For that now, that part,
to go on the dorsal of the fuselage

74
00:04:22,177 --> 00:04:25,293
will require probably
some extra modifications,

75
00:04:25,293 --> 00:04:27,923
so we'll call that
the next version of the Lynx.

76
00:04:29,194 --> 00:04:32,710
And instead of the passenger
on the right seat in the cockpit,

77
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,805
we can exchange it
for a full scientific module

78
00:04:35,805 --> 00:04:40,152
up to 120 kilos to do
scientific research experiments.

79
00:04:40,543 --> 00:04:42,868
And in addition to that,
behind the pilot's seat,

80
00:04:42,868 --> 00:04:45,493
we have another smaller payload bay

81
00:04:45,493 --> 00:04:48,658
it's about a shoe box size in volume

82
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:51,250
up to 20 kilos in weight

83
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:54,038
that we can take
for pretty much any flight,

84
00:04:54,559 --> 00:04:56,698
any experiment or any payload.

85
00:05:01,073 --> 00:05:03,425
The mission profile of a typical flight.

86
00:05:03,426 --> 00:05:05,541
I said we take off from a regular runway,

87
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:08,544
so for Flight Test Operations
that will be Mojave,

88
00:05:08,544 --> 00:05:11,603
for early operations will be
Mojave here in California;

89
00:05:13,074 --> 00:05:16,186
after take off, we'll start
a steep climb,

90
00:05:16,186 --> 00:05:22,901
and that climb will ultimately result
in almost a vertical climb profile.

91
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,864
We'll be accelerating
under our own power, quickly.

92
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:31,690
We'll go supersonic
in about a minute or two;

93
00:05:31,881 --> 00:05:35,251
and after three, three and a half minutes
we're already outside of the atmosphere.

94
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:40,179
And we'll have the main engine cutoff
around 190,000 feet.

95
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:42,800
From there on,
we'll start a weightless phase

96
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:44,904
that lasts about 4-5 minutes.

97
00:05:44,905 --> 00:05:47,204
In the middle of the weightless phase,
we'll hit the highest point;

98
00:05:47,204 --> 00:05:49,750
normally, that should be
about 103 kilometers,

99
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,505
or 330, 000 feet.

100
00:05:51,505 --> 00:05:56,038
And after that weightless phase
is complete, we'll do a re-entry,

101
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,123
pretty similar to X-15,

102
00:05:58,123 --> 00:06:01,673
at the end of the 60's, early 70's.

103
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:07,121
We have small, steering rockets
by which we can accurately control

104
00:06:07,122 --> 00:06:09,135
the altitude of the spaceship,

105
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:12,713
thereby we can control our re-entry

106
00:06:12,714 --> 00:06:15,017
in conjunction with
the aerodynamic controls.

107
00:06:15,017 --> 00:06:18,013
Re-entry will last about 30-45 seconds

108
00:06:18,014 --> 00:06:22,918
where we will probably will endure
up to 4 Gs, so the G is coming above.

109
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:26,502
We will also be decelerated
so we call that a negative Gx;

110
00:06:26,503 --> 00:06:31,251
so that combination will last
for about 30-40 seconds.

111
00:06:31,447 --> 00:06:33,837
And after that,
it's going to be a glide flight

112
00:06:33,837 --> 00:06:36,602
back to where we took off from,

113
00:06:36,603 --> 00:06:41,568
and all in all should be about
45-60 minutes flight.

114
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:52,567
No, we have, I would say,
a pretty small cockpit,

115
00:06:52,568 --> 00:06:57,159
it's roomier than an F-16 for example,

116
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:59,762
that I've been used to fly in,

117
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:06,561
but it's definitely not large enough
to unbuckle and start doing somersaults

118
00:07:06,562 --> 00:07:10,808
or other stuff that you can do
on a zero-G flight for example.

119
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:15,027
But I think the experience itself,
the fact that you are weightless,

120
00:07:15,028 --> 00:07:17,178
you will not feel
that you are still buckled up,

121
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:19,143
you don't feel
that you are still in the seat,

122
00:07:19,143 --> 00:07:21,968
and that you float with the ship and all,

123
00:07:21,968 --> 00:07:25,019
and we have the canopy around us,

124
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,719
so it allows for a great view.

125
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,206
So we don't have to sort
through a small porthole

126
00:07:29,206 --> 00:07:30,595
and peek outside;

127
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:34,553
I mean the whole canopy
front, right, left, and all above

128
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:37,764
is available, right there, in front of us.

129
00:07:37,765 --> 00:07:41,345
So, we will stay in our seats,
we don't feel it,

130
00:07:41,346 --> 00:07:45,049
and with that, I think, the zero-G,
or the micro-gravity experience

131
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:49,232
will not be anything less
in comparison to the ones

132
00:07:49,232 --> 00:07:51,856
that we advertized for a zero-G training.

133
00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:57,057
What are the characteristics
of the spaceports?

134
00:07:57,057 --> 00:07:59,882
Well, the cool thing for us is,

135
00:07:59,883 --> 00:08:04,019
they don't have to look like
anything else than a normal airport.

136
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:07,602
All we need to do is make sure
that we meet the bureaucratic challenges,

137
00:08:07,603 --> 00:08:09,307
as far as licenses and stuff.

138
00:08:09,308 --> 00:08:14,062
We will have to live
with a lot of the ITAR restrictions,

139
00:08:14,063 --> 00:08:17,114
so that it'll encourage,
probably, security restrictions,

140
00:08:17,114 --> 00:08:19,797
but that's stuff that you see
regularly on the airports as well.

141
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:23,928
Other than that, all we need is
a runway that is sufficient long enough,

142
00:08:23,929 --> 00:08:28,024
and airspace right on top 
of that airfield that we need to use

143
00:08:28,024 --> 00:08:30,916
for our vertical climb 
and descent profile,

144
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,612
or almost vertical.

145
00:08:33,423 --> 00:08:37,828
So, with that, literally, any, let's say,

146
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:42,025
larger airport, for us,

147
00:08:42,027 --> 00:08:45,175
we can turn that into a spaceport.

148
00:08:45,176 --> 00:08:47,886
We have a very small logistical footprint,

149
00:08:47,887 --> 00:08:53,595
so we need very little of the things
that are already at any airport.

150
00:08:54,956 --> 00:08:58,713
So any airport
could be a spaceport, in our vision.

151
00:09:01,214 --> 00:09:04,282
So, currently, Mojave, Curacao,

152
00:09:04,282 --> 00:09:07,293
we'll fly out of Midland, in Texas,

153
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:09,586
where part of out company is located,

154
00:09:09,586 --> 00:09:12,149
we have encampments out in Florida,

155
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:14,240
the Shuttle landing facility,

156
00:09:14,241 --> 00:09:16,741
so that will probably--
those are going to be

157
00:09:16,741 --> 00:09:19,480
our future locations
where we operate from,

158
00:09:19,481 --> 00:09:22,681
or we'll have a part of company based at.

159
00:09:22,682 --> 00:09:25,365
Other than that, we have
a very flexible concept,

160
00:09:25,366 --> 00:09:28,918
where we can easily transport
the spaceship

161
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:33,289
in any commercial strategic
transport aircraft

162
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:35,930
like a Boeing-747 freight, for example,

163
00:09:35,931 --> 00:09:37,694
where the nose can be opened,

164
00:09:37,694 --> 00:09:39,667
or any similar aircraft;

165
00:09:39,668 --> 00:09:42,265
we can easily fit the Lynx inside,

166
00:09:42,976 --> 00:09:47,452
support equipments, support personnel,
and operating personnel,

167
00:09:47,453 --> 00:09:49,542
we'll fly to whatever our location is

168
00:09:49,542 --> 00:09:51,011
where we need to operate from,

169
00:09:51,011 --> 00:09:53,027
unload it, do our operations,

170
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,985
ready to go, back in and back up,

171
00:09:54,985 --> 00:09:57,086
come back to one of our own locations.

172
00:09:57,086 --> 00:09:59,374
So, we'll have a very flexible way

173
00:09:59,374 --> 00:10:01,619
of coming out to our clients

174
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,291
and do the operations required.

175
00:10:09,668 --> 00:10:14,115
Well, that is a big step
in the future, I think.

176
00:10:14,116 --> 00:10:16,322
Currently, Lynx is not suitable

177
00:10:16,323 --> 00:10:20,221
to go far down range,
if we call it like that,

178
00:10:20,221 --> 00:10:22,810
or do point-to-point transportation,

179
00:10:23,321 --> 00:10:26,905
but you can compare to,
let's say, the very early flights

180
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:28,196
in aviation,

181
00:10:28,197 --> 00:10:30,274
where we proved to the public

182
00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:31,705
that flying was safe,

183
00:10:31,706 --> 00:10:35,376
and that if the scenic flights,
just the famous ones

184
00:10:35,377 --> 00:10:37,036
are the ones with KLM,

185
00:10:37,037 --> 00:10:38,873
that the first two years of its operations

186
00:10:38,873 --> 00:10:41,394
mainly get the scenic flights
around Amsterdam, 15-20 minutes

187
00:10:41,394 --> 00:10:44,555
because that was all the airplanes
could do at the time,

188
00:10:44,555 --> 00:10:45,625
but soon thereafter,

189
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,733
they had the first services

190
00:10:47,733 --> 00:10:52,177
to Germany, to Denmark, France,

191
00:10:52,178 --> 00:10:55,489
the UK, Switzerland, and from there on,

192
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,301
in less than in 100 years,

193
00:10:57,301 --> 00:10:59,988
we can fly to any destination
of this planet,

194
00:10:59,988 --> 00:11:03,124
so it can hopefully develop
pretty quickly

195
00:11:03,124 --> 00:11:05,321
into an important operation.

196
00:11:05,762 --> 00:11:08,072
But currently, with Lynx,
we are not there.

197
00:11:11,737 --> 00:11:13,399
That's a great question.

198
00:11:14,419 --> 00:11:16,151
Hopefully, in the future,

199
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:21,367
as we get into the normal pace
of operations with Lynx,

200
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:23,443
we will develop a training plan,

201
00:11:23,444 --> 00:11:26,701
both for the participants
and for the pilots.

202
00:11:27,463 --> 00:11:31,688
Currently, we don't look far beyond
developmental testing,

203
00:11:32,043 --> 00:11:38,303
so that requires
a conventional test pilot school education

204
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:42,604
preferably one of four military schools
in the West,

205
00:11:42,605 --> 00:11:45,023
or the National Test Pilot School 
here in the US

206
00:11:45,024 --> 00:11:47,902
could be another good example.

207
00:11:47,903 --> 00:11:52,607
And also, let's say, comparable
or experience on

208
00:11:52,608 --> 00:11:56,423
comparable high performance
aircraft or systems.

209
00:11:57,184 --> 00:12:00,291
So that is a small combination
for developmental testing.

210
00:12:00,292 --> 00:12:02,126
Ultimately, where we are going,

211
00:12:02,156 --> 00:12:03,544
well, that's a good question.

212
00:12:03,664 --> 00:12:05,534
We'll have to see what is required

213
00:12:05,535 --> 00:12:07,138
to fly the Lynx,

214
00:12:07,139 --> 00:12:11,416
and it could be very similar
to the standard today development

215
00:12:11,417 --> 00:12:13,142
of commercial aviation

216
00:12:13,143 --> 00:12:15,346
into a separate educational track

217
00:12:15,347 --> 00:12:19,121
for the future commercial space pilots.

218
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:21,746
For the spaceflight participants,

219
00:12:21,747 --> 00:12:24,083
we have already developed a training plan,

220
00:12:24,084 --> 00:12:27,396
we provide several trainings
for our customers,

221
00:12:27,397 --> 00:12:30,321
both in simulators,
and the real aircraft.

222
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:34,112
We have experience with that since 2012,

223
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:38,167
we do 3 training programs
in the Netherlands,

224
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:40,959
and currently
2 training programs in the US,

225
00:12:40,963 --> 00:12:42,981
and we are hopefully going to expand that

226
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:44,765
and we do some other programs

227
00:12:44,766 --> 00:12:45,765
in addition,

228
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:50,195
like given the opportunity to do
zero-G flights

229
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:55,985
on ESA's or, let's say,
the European zero-G airplane,

230
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:59,043
and some other that are similar,

231
00:12:59,043 --> 00:13:03,760
so we are already training
our crew members, if you will,

232
00:13:04,731 --> 00:13:07,859
mainly the guys in the right seat,

233
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:11,656
and hopefully we'll firm up plans
by the time we complete

234
00:13:11,657 --> 00:13:14,595
developmental testing for the pilots side.

235
00:13:19,678 --> 00:13:21,227
Selection of the participants:

236
00:13:21,228 --> 00:13:23,442
we're currently selling tickets

237
00:13:23,443 --> 00:13:27,312
so that means that if you buy a ticket,
or you win a ticket,

238
00:13:27,313 --> 00:13:31,842
because we sell to individuals,
but also to organizations

239
00:13:31,843 --> 00:13:34,215
who would like to buy more tickets

240
00:13:34,216 --> 00:13:36,163
and then hand them out, let's say,

241
00:13:36,164 --> 00:13:39,000
winners of a specific campaign or so,

242
00:13:39,001 --> 00:13:41,427
like we have done in the past
with the Axe Apollo group

243
00:13:41,427 --> 00:13:43,617
and that Phillips is doing as we speak.

244
00:13:44,628 --> 00:13:46,333
If you then get a ticket,

245
00:13:46,334 --> 00:13:50,174
then we have a medical protocol,
or a medical check for you.

246
00:13:50,765 --> 00:13:52,366
Nothing fancy,

247
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:55,386
but we have to address certain points

248
00:13:55,387 --> 00:13:58,066
just to make sure
that we avoid certain risks

249
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:00,366
that are associated with the flight,

250
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:04,367
that has to do with the combination
of the zero-G and positive Gs,

251
00:14:05,686 --> 00:14:10,625
but typically, anyone who is
in good health has nothing to fear,

252
00:14:10,626 --> 00:14:12,476
and they will have no problem.

253
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,160
And after that, we require you

254
00:14:15,371 --> 00:14:20,071
to participate in one or two
training programs that we advertize

255
00:14:20,384 --> 00:14:23,084
and if you completed that,
then you are ready to go.

256
00:14:28,147 --> 00:14:29,988
That is really up to the scientists,

257
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:35,596
I mean, we provide, let's say,
micro-gravity time,

258
00:14:35,596 --> 00:14:37,895
or situation of our flights,

259
00:14:37,895 --> 00:14:42,637
so on our prototype, that it'll be
a little shorter than 4-5 minutes

260
00:14:42,637 --> 00:14:44,260
to what is offered on the mark two,

261
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,310
which we will go to 100 km,
prototype mark one,

262
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:49,275
and we'll be open
for this type of operations

263
00:14:49,275 --> 00:14:51,431
if we are done
with the flight test program,

264
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:56,581
but the maximum that we currently think

265
00:14:56,581 --> 00:14:59,160
this vehicle will fly to is 200,000 feet,

266
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,381
so a little shorter
in micro-gravity time,

267
00:15:01,381 --> 00:15:05,606
but really the experiment needs
to meet all the safety criteria

268
00:15:05,606 --> 00:15:08,317
that we are developing right now,

269
00:15:08,317 --> 00:15:10,817
in conjunction with the AFA.

270
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:14,069
But other than that, we don't limit anyone

271
00:15:14,069 --> 00:15:18,264
into designing an experiment
and fly on board with Lynx.

272
00:15:18,264 --> 00:15:20,413
So, I can name a couple of examples

273
00:15:20,413 --> 00:15:25,168
where people are developing
their scientific experiments

274
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:26,613
for right now,

275
00:15:26,613 --> 00:15:30,732
but I certainly don't want to limit
people in their thinking.

276
00:15:30,732 --> 00:15:34,360
We are open for life sciences,
we are open for microgravity research,

277
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:37,130
for all kind of other applications.

278
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:40,814
A very interesting project
is being developed

279
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:46,210
by one of our national Physics Institute

280
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:48,833
to do fundamental physics research

281
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:51,269
into water,

282
00:15:51,709 --> 00:15:54,639
and they've developed
this fascinating project

283
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:59,671
where, if you have two beakers of water
and you apply a large voltage differential

284
00:15:59,671 --> 00:16:03,049
a small--we call it
the floating water bridge-- will form

285
00:16:03,049 --> 00:16:05,008
between the two beakers,

286
00:16:05,008 --> 00:16:07,074
up to three centimeters.

287
00:16:07,074 --> 00:16:09,229
It's a fascinating thing to see,

288
00:16:09,229 --> 00:16:11,479
and they want to do more research

289
00:16:11,479 --> 00:16:13,555
especially, under microgravity conditions,

290
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,128
in order to explain that phenomenon.

291
00:16:15,128 --> 00:16:17,758
And that's to do
with the dynamic behavior of water.

292
00:16:17,758 --> 00:16:20,963
And it could, hopefully, ultimately,
result in an explanation

293
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:23,361
of why energy can be stored in water;

294
00:16:24,061 --> 00:16:25,504
that we know from a thunderstorm

295
00:16:25,504 --> 00:16:29,072
that's just a body of water
that has a lot of energy stored in it--

296
00:16:29,072 --> 00:16:32,379
we can't control it,
but it's got a lot of electrical energy--

297
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,492
and hopefully, with this experiment

298
00:16:34,492 --> 00:16:38,111
we learn how that phenomenon comes about,

299
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:40,711
and perhaps, in the future,
allows us to control it.

300
00:16:40,711 --> 00:16:42,397
And also to store data in water,

301
00:16:42,397 --> 00:16:43,933
so it's mind boggling

302
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:46,496
just to be able to contribute to science

303
00:16:46,496 --> 00:16:48,305
with an experiment like that.

304
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:51,595
Other offer that we can easily do
is high altitude research.

305
00:16:52,975 --> 00:16:55,374
Come up with real data, measurements,

306
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,381
on the higher atmosphere;

307
00:16:57,381 --> 00:16:59,838
currently , air balloons do a lot of that,

308
00:16:59,838 --> 00:17:01,949
but they don't go much higher
that 20 kilometers,

309
00:17:01,949 --> 00:17:03,635
where then they burst.

310
00:17:03,635 --> 00:17:07,744
And we'll do anything
above up to 100 kilometers

311
00:17:07,744 --> 00:17:09,656
on a daily basis,

312
00:17:09,656 --> 00:17:12,052
and on several and various locations.

313
00:17:12,902 --> 00:17:14,654
Other things we are doing,

314
00:17:14,654 --> 00:17:17,053
people are developing telescopes

315
00:17:17,053 --> 00:17:19,219
to do interplanetary research
in the future,

316
00:17:19,219 --> 00:17:20,755
or Earth observation,

317
00:17:20,755 --> 00:17:24,386
and we are open for business,

318
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:28,742
so we will, hopefully, see
some exciting experiments in the future.

319
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:36,345
What is important is, first of all,

320
00:17:37,002 --> 00:17:40,761
thanks of the great questions
on the scientific experiments,

321
00:17:40,761 --> 00:17:43,538
because, I think,
there is sometimes the perception

322
00:17:43,538 --> 00:17:48,157
that what we are doing is
just for the happy few and just for fun;

323
00:17:48,157 --> 00:17:51,202
what I'd like to point out,
is, what we are doing

324
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:52,298
is very serious.

325
00:17:52,298 --> 00:17:54,640
And we are opening a new world

326
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,387
to the people,

327
00:17:56,387 --> 00:17:59,353
that is there to use by the people.

328
00:17:59,353 --> 00:18:01,838
And this new world is outside
of our atmosphere.

329
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:04,797
We think that

330
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:07,476
the importance of space applications
in the future

331
00:18:07,476 --> 00:18:09,571
will only increase.

332
00:18:10,211 --> 00:18:16,089
Right now, we are fully dependent
on applications like communications,

333
00:18:16,089 --> 00:18:18,208
Internet,

334
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:20,961
GPS signals for navigation purposes,

335
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:23,118
and all these signals come to us

336
00:18:23,118 --> 00:18:26,267
from satellites,
or from space, if you will.

337
00:18:26,657 --> 00:18:28,926
A lot of the knowledge that we have gained

338
00:18:28,926 --> 00:18:30,530
on climate change

339
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:33,221
comes from sensors that we based in space.

340
00:18:33,221 --> 00:18:38,055
So if we start to learn, to live,
and work more, in space,

341
00:18:38,055 --> 00:18:41,195
I think, we open a new world

342
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:44,987
that could offer a lot of answers
to our questions,

343
00:18:45,857 --> 00:18:52,203
offer a lot of facilities to our needs,

344
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:55,917
and probably more
than we can imagine at this time.

345
00:18:55,917 --> 00:18:57,575
So, I think it's of great importance

346
00:18:57,575 --> 00:19:01,222
that we really start to look
outside of the atmosphere,

347
00:19:01,222 --> 00:19:04,877
perhaps for point-to-point travel
like you mentioned--

348
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,519
you know, just the ISS
is a great example--

349
00:19:07,519 --> 00:19:10,347
it's circumnavigating Earth
in an hour and a half,

350
00:19:10,347 --> 00:19:11,854
and that is mind-boggling.

351
00:19:11,854 --> 00:19:14,074
A few people realize
that we already have the technology

352
00:19:14,074 --> 00:19:15,998
to, if you get there,

353
00:19:15,998 --> 00:19:17,799
reach any destination on this planet,

354
00:19:17,799 --> 00:19:19,271
within an hour and a half;

355
00:19:19,271 --> 00:19:21,422
I'm really convinced that our children

356
00:19:21,422 --> 00:19:22,936
will go for lunch in Australia,

357
00:19:22,936 --> 00:19:24,936
and will be home for dinner.

358
00:19:24,936 --> 00:19:26,975
Use less energy to get there,

359
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:29,765
and it's better for the environment,

360
00:19:29,765 --> 00:19:32,294
so that's really what we need to do;

361
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:35,663
improve ways of living
and working in space

362
00:19:35,663 --> 00:19:39,287
in order to improve our chances 
for survival on this planet.

363
00:19:43,928 --> 00:19:45,985
Right, that's a great question.

364
00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:48,698
I think, as a kid,
I've always been fascinated

365
00:19:48,698 --> 00:19:51,403
by aviation and space.

366
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:55,659
Seeing airplanes fly, as a kid,

367
00:19:55,659 --> 00:19:58,644
and imagine that I could be
on board some day

368
00:19:58,644 --> 00:20:01,837
was inspiring as a kid,

369
00:20:03,237 --> 00:20:06,537
so, in a way,
one of my dreams came true

370
00:20:06,537 --> 00:20:10,271
when I was allowed to join the air force,

371
00:20:10,271 --> 00:20:13,522
and ultimately, flew F-16s
for almost 20 years.

372
00:20:15,122 --> 00:20:17,668
But I've always also been inspired

373
00:20:17,668 --> 00:20:21,491
by the folks that kept pushing out
the borders,

374
00:20:21,491 --> 00:20:23,089
and went out of the atmosphere,

375
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:25,304
went, you know into space,
even to the Moon.

376
00:20:26,224 --> 00:20:27,883
And it's just mind-boggling

377
00:20:27,883 --> 00:20:32,983
that we do have the capabilities 
and the knowledge to get there,

378
00:20:32,983 --> 00:20:37,375
but we get there, just, let's say,

379
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:39,039
on a very small scale.

380
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,636
So I was flying out of
the Edwards Airforce Base,

381
00:20:42,636 --> 00:20:44,255
in 2004-2006,

382
00:20:44,255 --> 00:20:46,899
where we did flight tests on F-16s.

383
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:50,443
With the Netherlands airforce
that I used to fly in.

384
00:20:50,443 --> 00:20:52,180
And then, right next door, in Mojave,

385
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,902
was where the XPrize was won, in 2004,

386
00:20:54,902 --> 00:20:56,009
so that showed me

387
00:20:56,009 --> 00:20:58,495
that a regular company,

388
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:02,583
let's say people
that were as smart as we were,

389
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:03,779
or perhaps a little smarter,

390
00:21:03,779 --> 00:21:06,292
but not from a different background,

391
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:12,167
just flew to space on September 29 
and October 4, 2004

392
00:21:13,347 --> 00:21:15,249
with a privately developed spaceship.

393
00:21:15,249 --> 00:21:17,582
So that really got my interest,

394
00:21:17,582 --> 00:21:20,468
and I saw this emerging space industry

395
00:21:20,468 --> 00:21:23,734
with Richard Branson
as one of the entrepreneurs

396
00:21:24,874 --> 00:21:27,805
brave enough to start
an enterprise there;

397
00:21:27,805 --> 00:21:30,787
and he started to be followed 
by a lot of other companies

398
00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:32,896
that are doing magnificent things,

399
00:21:32,896 --> 00:21:35,135
and XCOR is just one small company

400
00:21:35,135 --> 00:21:38,276
in that new, commercial space industry.

401
00:21:38,276 --> 00:21:43,093
So, I'm extremely happy that I can use
all the knowledge and experience

402
00:21:43,093 --> 00:21:45,817
that I was allowed to gain in the airforce

403
00:21:46,047 --> 00:21:50,508
and now help XCOR make its mark

404
00:21:50,508 --> 00:21:52,517
in the commercial space industry,

405
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:55,558
and open new ways for mankind.

406
00:21:55,558 --> 00:21:57,784
So, that's kind of how I've got inspired

407
00:21:57,784 --> 00:21:58,918
and how I got here,

408
00:21:58,918 --> 00:22:04,584
and it's always difficult
for, I think, Europeans,

409
00:22:04,584 --> 00:22:09,665
to get access to a space program.

410
00:22:09,665 --> 00:22:11,927
ESA is a fantastic organization,

411
00:22:11,927 --> 00:22:15,175
but there are only a few people
that are actually making it

412
00:22:15,175 --> 00:22:17,774
into the ISS or a space program.

413
00:22:17,774 --> 00:22:20,097
A little better maybe organized,

414
00:22:20,097 --> 00:22:23,664
and better opportunities for the people
is here in the United States,

415
00:22:23,664 --> 00:22:25,244
and maybe also in Russia,

416
00:22:25,244 --> 00:22:27,215
but still, I think,

417
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:30,356
we should bring space closer to people.
