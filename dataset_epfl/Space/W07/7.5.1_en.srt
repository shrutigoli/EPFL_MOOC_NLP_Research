00:00:05,539 --> 00:00:06,751
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,998
In this video, let's address
the subject of suborbital spaceflight,

3
00:00:11,999 --> 00:00:15,539
which nowadays is performed
mainly by commercial companies.

4
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:19,574
The definition
of a suborbital spaceflight,

5
00:00:19,575 --> 00:00:22,824
it's a flight in which
the spacecraft reaches space,

6
00:00:22,825 --> 00:00:25,584
which is more 
than 100 kilometers altitude

7
00:00:25,585 --> 00:00:26,794
in the case of the Earth.

8
00:00:26,795 --> 00:00:28,543
This is the so-called Kármán line,

9
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:33,273
the boundary between aeronautics
below 100 kilometers

10
00:00:33,274 --> 00:00:35,814
and astronautics above 100 kilometers.

11
00:00:36,242 --> 00:00:38,992
If you go above 100 kilometers,
you have gone into space.

12
00:00:39,542 --> 00:00:41,291
And the case of suborbital,

13
00:00:41,292 --> 00:00:45,031
the trajectory of the spacecraft
intersects the atmosphere

14
00:00:45,032 --> 00:00:47,602
or the surface of the body
from which it was launched.

15
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,262
So it does not even complete one orbit.

16
00:00:50,263 --> 00:00:53,153
Obviously, you can do 
a suborbital flight from the Moon,

17
00:00:54,197 --> 00:00:58,096
just hopping up,
reaching a certain altitude,

18
00:00:58,097 --> 00:00:59,386
and then coming back down,

19
00:00:59,387 --> 00:01:00,886
because there's no atmosphere,

20
00:01:00,887 --> 00:01:03,086
there's no boundary of space,

21
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:06,066
like is the case for the Earth
or any planet for that matter

22
00:01:06,067 --> 00:01:07,317
which has an atmosphere.

23
00:01:07,907 --> 00:01:10,777
And let's look at the profile
on the left-hand side.

24
00:01:12,013 --> 00:01:16,742
The spacecraft is either
taking off by its own means --

25
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,827
we'll see some examples later--

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:22,449
or carried to a certain altitude
within the atmosphere

27
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,019
by a carrier aircraft.

28
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,939
Then it fires a rocket engine

29
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:28,820
and goes up nearly vertically.

30
00:01:30,001 --> 00:01:34,000
A little bit shy
of the 100 kilometers boundary,

31
00:01:34,001 --> 00:01:36,041
we have a cut-off of the engine.

32
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,209
And then, this part of the trajectory
is nearly parabolic.

33
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,261
In fact, it's elliptic trajectory
with the center of the Earth

34
00:01:48,262 --> 00:01:49,794
being at one of the focus,

35
00:01:49,794 --> 00:01:51,284
but it is nearly parabolic.

36
00:01:51,753 --> 00:01:55,542
Then, there is typically
a few minutes of weightlessness.

37
00:01:55,543 --> 00:01:58,303
So the spacecraft is just on free-fall.

38
00:01:59,413 --> 00:02:02,372
It comes down back in the atmosphere.

39
00:02:02,373 --> 00:02:07,242
Then, of course, there is
the critical phase of the re-entry

40
00:02:07,243 --> 00:02:09,118
in the denser layers of the atmosphere,

41
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,119
which has to be solved
by the manufacturer

42
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,598
of the spaceplane.

43
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:16,269
We'll talk about that later.

44
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,339
Typically, you have relatively high
G-forces when you come back,

45
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,839
of the order of 4Gs.

46
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,300
And then the flight ends up with gliding,

47
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,290
normally without any engine,

48
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:30,479
to a runway--
and landing on the runway.

49
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,771
This is suborbital spaceflight.

50
00:02:33,941 --> 00:02:40,950
Well, in the U.S. the first manned,
or with humans on board suborbital flights

51
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:45,220
were the first spaceflight 
of Americans in space

52
00:02:45,221 --> 00:02:49,311
that was following
the flight of Gagarin in April, 1961.

53
00:02:50,008 --> 00:02:53,458
In the U.S. we had Al Shepard,

54
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,335
who did the first spaceflight
going with a Redstone rocket,

55
00:02:57,338 --> 00:03:01,758
which you see on the left-hand side,
on a suborbital flight

56
00:03:02,579 --> 00:03:05,929
reaching an altitude
of a little above 100 kilometers.

57
00:03:06,962 --> 00:03:08,601
This is Redstone 3--

58
00:03:08,602 --> 00:03:10,871
Redstone being the name of the rocket--

59
00:03:10,872 --> 00:03:13,791
and Redstone 4 was with Gus Grissom,

60
00:03:13,792 --> 00:03:15,981
whom you see on the right-hand side.

61
00:03:15,982 --> 00:03:17,891
Also a suborbital flight.

62
00:03:17,892 --> 00:03:20,892
And these were the first
spaceflights of Americans.

63
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:23,912
A few years later,

64
00:03:24,463 --> 00:03:28,463
NASA developed 
a very fast aircraft, the X-15,

65
00:03:29,013 --> 00:03:32,852
which reached
a very high speed of about Mach 7,

66
00:03:32,853 --> 00:03:34,352
seven times the speed of sound.

67
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:38,282
And on two occasions,
with the pilot, Joseph Walker,

68
00:03:38,283 --> 00:03:39,702
it reached space,

69
00:03:39,703 --> 00:03:43,002
an altitude of more than 100 kilometers.

70
00:03:43,003 --> 00:03:47,778
And you see this very fast plane

71
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:49,748
with a rocket engine in the back.

72
00:03:49,749 --> 00:03:53,198
And it had a fuel tank,
and an oxidizer tank.

73
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,398
And it had also attitude rockets

74
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:59,508
or reaction control system also
in the nose of the fuselage.

75
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:01,729
Because in very high layers 
of the atmosphere,

76
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,543
the air surfaces didn't work,

77
00:04:03,569 --> 00:04:08,268
couldn't change
the orientation of this aircraft.

78
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:12,478
And an attitude control system,
like a spaceship, had to be used.

79
00:04:12,509 --> 00:04:14,989
It's a very remarkable project;

80
00:04:16,084 --> 00:04:18,293
to think that in the 60s,
they already reached

81
00:04:18,293 --> 00:04:22,493
these very high velocities in space
in an aircraft is quite remarkable.

82
00:04:22,494 --> 00:04:27,003
And there was a lot of lessons learned
about control of a spacecraft

83
00:04:27,004 --> 00:04:28,614
at very, very high altitudes,

84
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:31,554
typically what a spacecraft
has to go through

85
00:04:31,555 --> 00:04:34,284
when it comes back
from a spaceflight on orbit.

86
00:04:34,285 --> 00:04:39,284
So, very useful data
for future space programs

87
00:04:39,285 --> 00:04:40,536
run by NASA.

88
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,133
Well, back to commercial companies

89
00:04:44,134 --> 00:04:48,134
attempting and realizing successfully
suborbital spaceflight.

90
00:04:48,135 --> 00:04:50,250
We had the Ansari X Prize,

91
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:57,320
which consisted in going to space
above 100 kilometers

92
00:04:58,001 --> 00:05:01,520
on two occasions within two weeks.

93
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:04,531
That was the goal

94
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,791
and the target of this Ansari X Prize,

95
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:12,501
which was won
by SpaceShip One in 2004,

96
00:05:13,698 --> 00:05:16,777
designed and built
by Scaled Composites,

97
00:05:16,778 --> 00:05:18,937
a company in California.

98
00:05:18,938 --> 00:05:23,498
And you see here the SpaceShip One

99
00:05:23,862 --> 00:05:26,501
carried in the bottom
of a carrier aircraft

100
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:28,491
that was brought to a certain altitude,

101
00:05:28,492 --> 00:05:31,841
and then it was detached
firing the rocket engine,

102
00:05:31,842 --> 00:05:33,982
which you see here
in the middle picture.

103
00:05:34,685 --> 00:05:39,074
Then going, like the profile was shown
on the previous slide,

104
00:05:39,075 --> 00:05:42,804
to about 60-70 kilometers,
shutting down the engine

105
00:05:42,805 --> 00:05:46,234
and then coming
over the boundary of 100 kilometers,

106
00:05:46,235 --> 00:05:47,535
then coming down.

107
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:52,791
It's interesting to see this,
on the lower right,

108
00:05:52,792 --> 00:05:57,512
the geometry of the spacecraft,
SpaceShip One,

109
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:59,540
as it was going up into space,

110
00:05:59,541 --> 00:06:02,300
and also the configuration
that we had for landing.

111
00:06:02,301 --> 00:06:04,100
But for the re-entry
in the atmosphere,

112
00:06:04,101 --> 00:06:08,510
after having reached
the peak altitude of 100 kilometers,

113
00:06:08,511 --> 00:06:13,242
the geometry of the spaceship
had to be modified,

114
00:06:13,243 --> 00:06:14,562
as is depicted here

115
00:06:14,563 --> 00:06:18,942
in order to remain stable
during the re-entry in the atmosphere,

116
00:06:18,943 --> 00:06:22,530
and also provide enough drag
in the high layers of the atmosphere.

117
00:06:22,531 --> 00:06:25,354
So, from a technical point of view
and a design point of view,

118
00:06:25,474 --> 00:06:29,210
that was quite a challenge
to provide this change in the geometry

119
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:30,930
for the re-entry in the atmosphere.

120
00:06:30,931 --> 00:06:33,390
Quite a successful program.

121
00:06:33,391 --> 00:06:37,931
And this team won
the Ansari X Prize in 2004.

122
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:42,009
The company Virgin Galactic
and Richard Branson

123
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:45,109
became involved in this successful project

124
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:51,429
with the idea of developing
another spaceplane,

125
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,539
SpaceShip Two,

126
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:55,679
which was going to be
pretty similar to SpaceShip One,

127
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,579
but with more room inside
in order to carry passengers to space,

128
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:04,410
to the boundary
of 100 kilometers and beyond.

129
00:07:05,649 --> 00:07:09,378
So the SpaceShip Two
was designed and built,

130
00:07:09,379 --> 00:07:11,338
and there was a new carrier aircraft,

131
00:07:11,339 --> 00:07:16,668
a so-called "White Knight",
a carrier aircraft with four jet engines.

132
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,309
There were a few test flights performed
with the SpaceShip Two.

133
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:25,170
Unfortunately, it was lost
in an accident in October, 2014.

134
00:07:26,507 --> 00:07:30,506
Virgin Galactic and the team
that had built the aircraft

135
00:07:30,507 --> 00:07:36,837
and tested it decided to build
another SpaceShip Two, the VSS Unity,

136
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:39,526
which was rolled out recently

137
00:07:39,527 --> 00:07:42,416
in February, 2016, in California,

138
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:47,806
and will be used again to carry passengers
to the boundary of space

139
00:07:47,807 --> 00:07:49,092
in a few months from now,

140
00:07:49,093 --> 00:07:52,563
possibly at the end of 2016 or in 2017.

141
00:07:53,876 --> 00:07:57,277
There's a similar effort pursued
by the company XCOR

142
00:07:57,278 --> 00:08:00,080
in the United States,
with a Lynx spaceplane,

143
00:08:00,575 --> 00:08:03,774
with a difference that this time
the idea is to reach space

144
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:05,104
more than 100 kilometers,

145
00:08:05,105 --> 00:08:09,495
but on a spaceplane
that takes off on a runway.

146
00:08:09,792 --> 00:08:11,741
We don't need a carrier aircraft.

147
00:08:11,742 --> 00:08:15,935
So then it rises to a high altitude,

148
00:08:15,936 --> 00:08:17,065
shuts down the engine,

149
00:08:17,066 --> 00:08:18,918
goes about 100, and then comes back,

150
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:20,558
and lands on the runway.

151
00:08:20,559 --> 00:08:25,969
The difference is that unlike
the SpaceShip Two of Virgin Galactic,

152
00:08:26,363 --> 00:08:29,002
we only have a two-seat cabin
for the pilot

153
00:08:29,003 --> 00:08:30,953
and a passenger or co-pilot.

154
00:08:32,174 --> 00:08:36,523
We have the LOX tank,
and the fuel tanker here,

155
00:08:36,524 --> 00:08:38,229
and the rocket engine in the back.

156
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:41,100
And again, takeoff from the runway
and landing on the runway

157
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:42,583
without carrier aircraft.

158
00:08:43,323 --> 00:08:48,583
This is the flight profile
of the Lynx Mk II spaceplane.

159
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:52,074
And as mentioned,
takeoff on the runway,

160
00:08:52,658 --> 00:08:56,658
powered assent with a maximum
of about three times the speed of sound,

161
00:08:57,404 --> 00:08:59,354
engine off to about 60 kilometers,

162
00:09:00,472 --> 00:09:04,731
reaching the boundary of space
only a bit above 100 kilometers,

163
00:09:04,732 --> 00:09:06,024
re-entering the atmosphere.

164
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:09,807
G-forces during the re-entry
will be about 4G.

165
00:09:09,808 --> 00:09:11,797
Then there's a glide and circle,

166
00:09:11,798 --> 00:09:14,538
and land on a runway without an engine.

167
00:09:16,267 --> 00:09:18,726
Another concept
for reaching suborbital space,

168
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:21,486
but this time,
with a completely different approach.

169
00:09:21,487 --> 00:09:23,216
We don't have a spaceplane any more,

170
00:09:23,217 --> 00:09:25,797
no taking off from a runway

171
00:09:26,227 --> 00:09:27,486
and landing on a runway.

172
00:09:27,487 --> 00:09:31,826
But it's a rocket-carrying a capsule

173
00:09:31,827 --> 00:09:34,167
with up to four people,

174
00:09:34,499 --> 00:09:36,518
pretty much on the vertical

175
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,078
and shutting down the engine
at a certain altitude,

176
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,809
so that the capsule reaches space
more than 100 kilometers.

177
00:09:44,209 --> 00:09:45,418
There are large windows.

178
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:49,709
And the occupants of the capsule
will have a beautiful view of the Earth,

179
00:09:50,013 --> 00:09:53,012
and the blackness of the sky,

180
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:54,784
and weightlessness for a few minutes.

181
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:58,142
Like was the case for the other two
that I presented before,

182
00:09:58,143 --> 00:10:00,933
SpaceShip Two and the Lynx spacecraft.

183
00:10:01,473 --> 00:10:04,572
And then, what is interesting is
that the rocket comes back down

184
00:10:04,573 --> 00:10:07,572
pretty much on the same vertical
and is recovered.

185
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:10,073
It's landing on a platform.

186
00:10:10,728 --> 00:10:14,387
And the capsule,
after reaching the maximum altitude

187
00:10:14,388 --> 00:10:15,678
will come down,

188
00:10:15,678 --> 00:10:18,297
re-enter the atmosphere
with some G-forces, obviously,

189
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:21,697
and will be parachuted down
to the surface of the Earth.

190
00:10:21,698 --> 00:10:24,907
There were two successful
test flights in 2015,

191
00:10:24,908 --> 00:10:27,527
including one in November, 2015,

192
00:10:27,528 --> 00:10:29,877
where the rocket was recovered.

193
00:10:29,878 --> 00:10:32,807
It had a four-leg structure,

194
00:10:32,808 --> 00:10:37,247
so that it landed back on the platform
where it was recovered.

195
00:10:37,248 --> 00:10:38,821
Quite an interesting approach.

196
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,239
Several other companies
are involved in suborbital flights

197
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,113
and spaceplane development.

198
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:51,594
Here we see a development by 
Airbus Defence and Space Company.

199
00:10:52,384 --> 00:10:55,514
It pretty much looks like a business jet

200
00:10:55,825 --> 00:10:58,524
with two turbo-jet engines

201
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,754
but a rocket engine in the back.

202
00:11:00,755 --> 00:11:03,514
So it will use the first two,
the turbo-jet engines,

203
00:11:03,515 --> 00:11:05,044
to go to a certain altitude,

204
00:11:05,045 --> 00:11:08,514
then will fire the rocket engine
to go up to the boundary of space.

205
00:11:08,515 --> 00:11:10,494
As you see, it's a canard configuration;

206
00:11:10,495 --> 00:11:14,255
the horizontal stabilizer in the front,
and the wing is in the back.

207
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:17,925
I don't have too many details on this one,

208
00:11:17,926 --> 00:11:20,355
but just to indicate
that several other companies

209
00:11:20,356 --> 00:11:22,986
beyond this one
and the one that I mentioned,

210
00:11:23,491 --> 00:11:26,830
are looking to the possibility 
of reaching the boundaries of space

211
00:11:26,831 --> 00:11:28,230
above 100 kilometers.

212
00:11:28,231 --> 00:11:30,800
And most of these companies
think of the future,

213
00:11:30,801 --> 00:11:34,280
not only carry passengers
to the boundaries of space

214
00:11:34,281 --> 00:11:35,790
but to carry payload also,

215
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:39,210
and allow the performance
of scientific experiments

216
00:11:39,211 --> 00:11:41,510
in the zero-G environment
for a few minutes.

217
00:11:41,511 --> 00:11:43,560
And some are 
even thinking of the idea

218
00:11:43,561 --> 00:11:47,790
of doing point-to-point suborbital flight
on the surface of the Earth,

219
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:52,539
going from London to Sydney
in about 40 minutes

220
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:54,519
on a suborbital trajectory.

221
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,620
I think the future will be very rich
in such endeavors.
