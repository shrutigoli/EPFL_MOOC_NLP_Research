1
00:00:05,876 --> 00:00:09,001
The future of human
Solar System exploration.

2
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:12,543
Of course, we left
the low Earth orbit already in the 60s,

3
00:00:12,544 --> 00:00:16,168
and visited the Moon on six occasions

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,124
in the frame of the Apollo program
during the 60s and the early 70s.

5
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,374
This was a wonderful program,

6
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:28,209
certainly a highlight
of human space exploration.

7
00:00:28,918 --> 00:00:31,502
We have had a number of rovers
on the surface,

8
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:36,043
we had several from Russia,
we had one from China,

9
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:39,709
we had a number of spacecraft
orbiting our satellite:

10
00:00:40,125 --> 00:00:44,084
the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter,
we had the SMART-1.

11
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:46,710
We know quite a lot
about the Moon already.

12
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:48,045
It's our neighbor,

13
00:00:48,045 --> 00:00:52,876
it's been very inspiring
for artists, for poets, for philosophers.

14
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:58,584
It's still there to be visited,
to be explored, and to be exploited.

15
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:01,917
ESA's Moon village.

16
00:01:01,949 --> 00:01:03,420
This is an idea proposed

17
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:07,918
by the new Director General of ESA,
Johann-Dietrich Woerner.

18
00:01:08,751 --> 00:01:11,314
The idea is really to do Moon exploration

19
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:13,793
by humans and robots
starting in the mid-20s.

20
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:18,001
It's generating a lot of excitement
at the European Space Agency

21
00:01:18,011 --> 00:01:21,180
among engineers and mission planners

22
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,848
and at the European
Astronaut Center in Cologne,

23
00:01:23,849 --> 00:01:27,834
where some of the current astronauts
and future astronauts

24
00:01:27,834 --> 00:01:31,209
that will be recruited in the near future

25
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:33,793
have the possibility
of walking on the Moon,

26
00:01:33,794 --> 00:01:35,792
and maybe going beyond the Moon.

27
00:01:36,667 --> 00:01:40,126
The idea is not only to visit 
the Moon and explore the Moon

28
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:42,954
but also try to use its resources.

29
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,042
Mining activities are very dirty
and polluting on the surface of the Earth,

30
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,043
mainly because of water and atmosphere,

31
00:01:51,044 --> 00:01:55,417
and there are certainly elements
that we could someday take from the Moon,

32
00:01:55,418 --> 00:01:57,833
whether it's Helium-3 or other minerals

33
00:01:57,834 --> 00:02:00,833
that we could exploit from the Moon
and bring them back to Earth.

34
00:02:00,834 --> 00:02:03,179
Again, the Moon is very close,
400,000 kilometers.

35
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:06,918
It takes two and a half days to go there,
two and a half days to come back.

36
00:02:06,918 --> 00:02:11,500
The depth of the gravitational well
of the Moon is very shallow,

37
00:02:11,501 --> 00:02:14,377
so going back from the Moon
in direction of the Earth

38
00:02:14,417 --> 00:02:16,652
uses very little energy,

39
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,698
so I'm convinced that someday,

40
00:02:18,709 --> 00:02:21,668
we will use and exploit
the Moon's resources.

41
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:26,291
Beyond the Moon,
it's certainly a possibility.

42
00:02:26,292 --> 00:02:28,584
But the planets in the Solar System,

43
00:02:28,626 --> 00:02:32,293
Mars and beyond Mars
are quite far away,

44
00:02:32,792 --> 00:02:36,668
and the idea is to go progressively
back to the Moon.

45
00:02:36,709 --> 00:02:41,543
This is certainly an objective of ESA,
and NASA is also considering that,

46
00:02:41,544 --> 00:02:44,383
and other space agencies as well.

47
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,124
Beyond the Moon, we have asteroids.

48
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,375
We have a lot of asteroids
in the Solar System,

49
00:02:49,417 --> 00:02:51,427
most of them are between Mars and Jupiter,

50
00:02:51,547 --> 00:02:56,501
but several of these are so-called NEOs,
near-Earth objects that have orbits

51
00:02:56,502 --> 00:03:00,335
that cross the orbit
of the Earth periodically.

52
00:03:01,292 --> 00:03:05,751
There's certainly the possibility
of beyond the Moon, going to asteroids.

53
00:03:05,769 --> 00:03:09,119
In fact, there's a plan
for redirecting an asteroid

54
00:03:09,125 --> 00:03:12,124
by a robotic mission,
bring it in the vicinity of the Earth,

55
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,959
maybe on orbit around the Moon,

56
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:17,018
or maybe on one of the Lagrange points,

57
00:03:17,019 --> 00:03:19,619
L1 or L2 of the Earth-Moon system,

58
00:03:20,042 --> 00:03:22,249
and then visit this asteroid

59
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:26,001
that has been brought robotically
by human spacecraft, typically Orion.

60
00:03:26,002 --> 00:03:29,167
Here, you see an artist's view
of two Orion spacecraft

61
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,626
in the vicinity of an asteroid
with an astronaut visiting

62
00:03:32,626 --> 00:03:37,041
this big chunk of a rock
in the Solar System.

63
00:03:37,042 --> 00:03:40,376
We could someday less, I would say,

64
00:03:40,751 --> 00:03:44,625
research asteroids and do exploration,

65
00:03:44,626 --> 00:03:50,460
but exploit the capabilities of asteroids
in providing minerals for the Earth.

66
00:03:51,329 --> 00:03:54,631
Human settlement on an asteroid,
this is not really a planned mission,

67
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:57,980
but this is a possibility,
at some point, we may settle there.

68
00:03:57,981 --> 00:04:02,209
The problem is that living from the land
on an asteroid is kind of difficult.

69
00:04:02,626 --> 00:04:06,833
If you want to get oxygen 
and food on an asteroid

70
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:09,418
it's going to be hard,
it's going to be easier on Mars,

71
00:04:09,538 --> 00:04:12,584
but hard on an asteroid,
but this is a possibility still.

72
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,085
The advantage of an asteroid is

73
00:04:14,167 --> 00:04:17,541
that they are much closer
than any planet in the Solar System,

74
00:04:17,584 --> 00:04:20,459
further away than the Moon
but closer than Mars.

75
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:26,334
Planet Mars is a logical step
beyond the Moon and asteroids.

76
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:31,710
A really very attractive planet,
a beautiful red color,

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,918
maybe was harboring life in the past,

78
00:04:34,918 --> 00:04:38,168
we are doing a lot of research
in this direction.

79
00:04:39,209 --> 00:04:41,541
It has a rotation period on itself,

80
00:04:41,542 --> 00:04:43,959
which is pretty similar
to the rotation period of the Earth.

81
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,209
It's close to one day.
It's called one sol.

82
00:04:46,232 --> 00:04:48,061
It's close to 24 hours.

83
00:04:48,542 --> 00:04:53,376
It also has a tilt in its rotation axis,
such that you have seasons on Mars.

84
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:55,918
It has a lot of similarities to the Earth,

85
00:04:56,334 --> 00:05:00,085
one of the big differences, of course,
is that it has a very thin atmosphere,

86
00:05:00,626 --> 00:05:03,793
mainly carbon dioxide atmosphere,
and the pressure on the surface

87
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:06,414
about one hundredth
of the atmospheric pressure

88
00:05:06,415 --> 00:05:07,811
at sea level on Earth.

89
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,126
Human settlement on Mars.

90
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:14,876
So, first of all, you need to go there,
and it takes a long time.

91
00:05:15,501 --> 00:05:18,416
Typically, seven to eight months

92
00:05:18,417 --> 00:05:21,701
if you want to go
on a Hohmann transfer trajectory

93
00:05:21,702 --> 00:05:24,959
from the Earth to the Red Planet.

94
00:05:25,417 --> 00:05:28,792
Maybe shorter time if you have
an advanced propulsion system,

95
00:05:29,667 --> 00:05:33,876
like the VASIMR propulsion system
or maybe a nuclear propulsion system.

96
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,793
Anyways, human settlement on Mars

97
00:05:36,834 --> 00:05:40,501
is certainly possible
in a few decades from now.

98
00:05:40,834 --> 00:05:44,626
In fact, NASA plans a visit to Mars
in the mid-30s of this century.

99
00:05:45,251 --> 00:05:47,066
The problem with life on Mars

100
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:50,605
or even any long journey
in the Solar System is radiation.

101
00:05:50,606 --> 00:05:55,418
Radiation coming from the Sun,
in the form of particles of the solar wind

102
00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:00,168
or radiation coming
from the galaxy, cosmic particle,

103
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:06,333
high energy particle,
even pretty high atomic mass nuclei

104
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:10,085
that penetrate [all]
living organisms and equipments.

105
00:06:10,542 --> 00:06:13,334
You don't the protection on Mars
that you have on the Earth

106
00:06:13,335 --> 00:06:17,490
with the geomagnetic field
deflecting the cosmic particles

107
00:06:17,491 --> 00:06:19,276
so that they don't reach

108
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:22,459
the region of the lower atmosphere
on the Earth's surface,

109
00:06:22,459 --> 00:06:25,668
at least not in the equatorial
and mid-latitude region;

110
00:06:25,669 --> 00:06:26,961
a little more in the Poles,

111
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:29,875
because of the geometry
of the magnetic field.

112
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:32,084
On Mars, you don't have any of that,

113
00:06:32,167 --> 00:06:35,209
so you have direct hits
from cosmic particles.

114
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:41,001
It's obvious that if crew members 
want to stay a reasonably long time

115
00:06:41,129 --> 00:06:42,378
on the surface of Mars,

116
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:44,959
they need to have habitation

117
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,751
that is protecting them
from cosmic particles,

118
00:06:47,752 --> 00:06:51,502
either underground or,
as we can see here on this artist's view,

119
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,705
some kind of a construction,

120
00:06:53,709 --> 00:06:57,958
where inside you are protected
against the cosmic particles.

121
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,543
Thin atmosphere is mentioned,
so if you want to go out,

122
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:05,251
you need to wear your spacesuits,
but the atmosphere being carbon dioxide,

123
00:07:05,252 --> 00:07:07,751
you can extract oxygen
from the carbon dioxide,

124
00:07:07,751 --> 00:07:09,710
and you have plenty of oxygen on Mars,

125
00:07:09,834 --> 00:07:13,710
you just have to chemically extract it
from the atmosphere.

126
00:07:14,792 --> 00:07:19,064
Human settlement on Mars is very likely
before the middle of this century.

127
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:22,084
It's unlikely that we have
large colonies on Mars,

128
00:07:22,116 --> 00:07:23,708
but at least explorers,

129
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:28,460
and people who are going to go there
to understand more about the Red Planet,

130
00:07:28,461 --> 00:07:31,210
and possibly exploit its resources also.

131
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:33,334
Beyond Mars, you have

132
00:07:33,417 --> 00:07:36,709
a number of really interesting objects
in the Solar System

133
00:07:37,209 --> 00:07:40,710
that will lend themselves
to first robotic exploration,

134
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:44,001
but also possibly someday
to human exploration.

135
00:07:44,834 --> 00:07:49,084
One of the satellites of Jupiter,
Europa is covered with ice,

136
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,878
and it has been determined

137
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:56,958
that, below this layer of ice,
there's an ocean, there's liquid water,

138
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:59,541
and obviously if we see liquid water,

139
00:07:59,542 --> 00:08:02,460
we see the possibility
of the development of life,

140
00:08:02,501 --> 00:08:04,583
even in a very primitive form.

141
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:08,460
So Europa is a really interesting object
ready for exploration,

142
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:10,990
robotic and human in the near future.

143
00:08:11,866 --> 00:08:13,589
Other highlights in the Solar System

144
00:08:13,709 --> 00:08:16,501
beyond Jupiter and its satellites,
including Europa,

145
00:08:16,502 --> 00:08:19,750
you have some really
interesting satellites,

146
00:08:19,751 --> 00:08:22,458
in particular two satellites of Saturn,

147
00:08:22,459 --> 00:08:27,876
Titan on one hand, 
the largest satellite of Saturn,

148
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,167
which has an atmosphere, and has

149
00:08:31,288 --> 00:08:35,124
also ammonia, methane on the surface,

150
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:39,876
possibly liquid lakes of ammonia, 
methane on the surface.

151
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,917
Certainly, you have the basic elements

152
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:47,667
for the fabrication of life on Titan.

153
00:08:47,876 --> 00:08:50,293
Really interesting object,
you have Enceladus,

154
00:08:50,294 --> 00:08:54,166
which is similar
in its structure to Europa,

155
00:08:54,167 --> 00:08:58,041
which we talked about before,
covered with solid ice,

156
00:08:58,042 --> 00:09:03,584
and possibly ocean, liquid ocean
below this crust of ice.

157
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:07,126
So other targets for robotic exploration,

158
00:09:07,168 --> 00:09:10,726
and much later,
possibly human exploration.
