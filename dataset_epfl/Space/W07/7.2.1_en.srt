1
00:00:06,375 --> 00:00:08,917
Spacewalking is
a really important capability

2
00:00:08,918 --> 00:00:14,170
that has been brought 
in human space flight since 1965;

3
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:15,344
really essential.

4
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:19,548
If we want to do repairs
on the spaceship wether it is the Space Shuttle,

5
00:00:19,549 --> 00:00:23,785
or some payload in the Space Shuttle,
or to do repair work on telescope,

6
00:00:23,785 --> 00:00:26,154
like was a case
for the Hubble Space Telescope

7
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:27,304
during the Shuttle time,

8
00:00:27,424 --> 00:00:30,559
or for the assembly
of the International Space Station,

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,508
or for repairs on
the International Space Station,

10
00:00:34,509 --> 00:00:37,160
spacewalking is really an essential tool,

11
00:00:37,161 --> 00:00:39,995
that normally a combination
of robotics and spacewalking

12
00:00:39,996 --> 00:00:44,140
is what is being used
for this repair maintenance work.

13
00:00:44,141 --> 00:00:46,995
Now, there has been a number
of Hollywood productions

14
00:00:46,996 --> 00:00:50,084
that have shown spacewalking EVAs,

15
00:00:50,124 --> 00:00:55,048
and two of the recent ones are
"Gravity" and "The Martian".

16
00:00:55,049 --> 00:00:57,713
these are good movies, very entertaining,

17
00:00:57,854 --> 00:01:01,869
I don't have any problem with these movies
and I had a lot of fun watching them,

18
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,769
but the spacewalking that you see in them

19
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,908
is not really like the real spacewalking.

20
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,831
A lot of it is untethered space walking.

21
00:01:11,832 --> 00:01:15,121
Of course, when the tether breaks
like here, it's untethered,

22
00:01:15,122 --> 00:01:18,862
but even in controlled spacewalking
at the end of the movie, "The Martian",

23
00:01:19,753 --> 00:01:22,490
when Matt Damon is recovered
on orbit around Mars

24
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:24,959
but a rescue team from the Earth,

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:28,322
there is a lot of untethered spacewalking
and rapid movement also,

26
00:01:28,323 --> 00:01:31,825
you go from one place
to the other rapidly spacewalking.

27
00:01:31,826 --> 00:01:36,122
There is also
a lot of yelling and shouting;

28
00:01:37,023 --> 00:01:39,812
not really the way we do really EVAs.

29
00:01:39,813 --> 00:01:43,731
But again, entertaining movies,
but EVAs are not really like that.

30
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:48,338
In reality, spacewalking is something
you do very slowly,

31
00:01:48,339 --> 00:01:50,236
in a very controlled manner.

32
00:01:50,237 --> 00:01:55,349
And all of the words exchanged
between the Mission Control Center

33
00:01:55,349 --> 00:01:58,502
and the crew on board the spaceship
and spacewalkers,

34
00:01:58,503 --> 00:02:01,201
normally two spacewalkers at a time,

35
00:02:01,202 --> 00:02:04,060
there are very calm words,
and very controlled.

36
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:06,186
That's a nice picture that was taken

37
00:02:06,186 --> 00:02:12,455
on the second servicing mission
of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1997,

38
00:02:12,456 --> 00:02:13,871
a very beautiful picture,

39
00:02:13,871 --> 00:02:16,613
where you see the Earth, you see the Sun,

40
00:02:16,614 --> 00:02:19,393
you see the background of the space
completely black,

41
00:02:19,394 --> 00:02:22,625
and you see the spacewalker
with one light.

42
00:02:22,658 --> 00:02:27,476
You know, you you go around the Earth
and if you spacewalk for six hours,

43
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:29,709
you go four times around the Earth,

44
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,755
so it's day and night, day and night,
day and night,

45
00:02:31,756 --> 00:02:35,126
and when it's orbital night,
you illuminate the place of work

46
00:02:35,132 --> 00:02:36,703
using these floodlights,

47
00:02:36,704 --> 00:02:38,026
and you continue working.

48
00:02:38,027 --> 00:02:40,813
You don't sleep during the orbital night,
you continue working.

49
00:02:42,764 --> 00:02:46,418
Alexander Gerst, ESA astronaut
of German nationality,

50
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:54,230
and Reid Wiseman, an American astronaut,
did a spacewalk in October, 2014,

51
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:58,386
from the International Space Station to do
some repair work on the cooling pumps

52
00:02:58,387 --> 00:03:03,782
and on the power system
for the ISS robotic arm,

53
00:03:04,213 --> 00:03:09,001
and recently, there's been a good production
made in Germany of this spacewalk.

54
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:12,137
It's called
"Zero Gravity: Mission in Space".

55
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:18,014
It's been shown now, at the beginning
of 2016 in movie theaters in Germany,

56
00:03:18,015 --> 00:03:21,345
and it will surely be shown
in other places very soon;

57
00:03:21,346 --> 00:03:23,452
so, if you have the opportunity,
have a look,

58
00:03:23,572 --> 00:03:25,901
"Zero Gravity: Mission in Space".

59
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:28,905
The history of spacewalking:

60
00:03:28,905 --> 00:03:33,716
the first spacewalk was done
by Alexei Leonov, a Soviet cosmonaut,

61
00:03:33,717 --> 00:03:36,348
on March 18, 1965.

62
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:41,372
It was a very short spacewalk,
only 12 minutes,

63
00:03:41,373 --> 00:03:45,384
and he came out--he was untethered,
but there was umbilical,

64
00:03:45,385 --> 00:03:48,857
at that time, there was
no portable life support system,

65
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:54,152
and the resources of oxygen
and the communications,

66
00:03:54,153 --> 00:03:56,518
this was all done by an umbilical.

67
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,389
He went out, and there was
a pretty difficult moment

68
00:04:01,389 --> 00:04:03,804
where he had difficulties
getting back in the airlock

69
00:04:04,495 --> 00:04:07,812
because his spacesuit,
for some reason, inflated somewhat,

70
00:04:07,813 --> 00:04:10,605
and it was very difficult moment
for Alexei,

71
00:04:10,606 --> 00:04:13,769
and he was smart
to deflate somewhat his suit,

72
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,272
but obviously, if you do that,

73
00:04:15,272 --> 00:04:16,286
you came in danger,

74
00:04:16,288 --> 00:04:19,303
because if you are at a too low pressure,
of gas over your body,

75
00:04:19,423 --> 00:04:22,415
then you risk your life,
or you can have severe problems.

76
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:23,821
Anyway, he made it,

77
00:04:23,822 --> 00:04:29,505
but it was a very tough exercise
for Alexei Leonov,

78
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:32,702
but he opened the way to spacewalking,

79
00:04:32,703 --> 00:04:36,166
and there were many, many,
many spacewalks that followed.

80
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,116
By the way, for ISS,

81
00:04:38,117 --> 00:04:42,655
there's nearly 200 spacewalks
that were performed

82
00:04:42,656 --> 00:04:44,482
for the assembly of ISS,

83
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:46,976
including spacewalks that were done

84
00:04:46,977 --> 00:04:50,134
from the ISS
for maintenance of the facility.

85
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:54,219
A few weeks later, we had
the first American doing a spacewalk,

86
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,953
Ed White, you see him here.

87
00:04:55,954 --> 00:04:58,275
Again, no portable life support system,

88
00:04:58,276 --> 00:04:59,887
but an umbilical cord,

89
00:04:59,888 --> 00:05:02,307
and on his right hand here,

90
00:05:02,308 --> 00:05:05,541
he has a kind of a gas pistol
he was trying to use

91
00:05:05,542 --> 00:05:08,460
in order to propel himself
in the vicinity of the spacecraft.

92
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:10,639
It didn't work too well,
it's very difficult;

93
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,928
if the thrust vector of such a system

94
00:05:12,929 --> 00:05:18,597
is not along the center of the mass
of the astronaut and his spacesuit,

95
00:05:18,598 --> 00:05:22,792
you're going to generate rotation
in addition to translation.

96
00:05:22,793 --> 00:05:24,443
But anyway, he tried that,

97
00:05:24,444 --> 00:05:27,984
and it was the first American spacewalk
and successful.

98
00:05:29,515 --> 00:05:31,664
On the US side we had

99
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:35,494
the Mercury program,
the Gemini program, and then Apollo.

100
00:05:35,494 --> 00:05:39,624
On Gemini we had already
a few spacewalks that were performed,

101
00:05:39,624 --> 00:05:42,264
and a special suit was developed

102
00:05:42,265 --> 00:05:47,214
for space walking
on the surface of the Moon,

103
00:05:47,215 --> 00:05:50,405
so crew activity
on the surface of our satellite.

104
00:05:50,999 --> 00:05:52,598
And you see a nice picture,

105
00:05:52,599 --> 00:05:54,848
a very well-known picture
on the left-hand side.

106
00:05:54,968 --> 00:06:00,508
This is Buzz Aldrin
in his Moon surface spacesuit;

107
00:06:00,509 --> 00:06:04,019
at that time, NASA had developed
portable life support systems,

108
00:06:04,019 --> 00:06:06,508
so you don't have an umbilical

109
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:09,268
between the spaceship
and the spacewalker.

110
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:11,355
And, of course, you don't have
a safety tether

111
00:06:11,355 --> 00:06:14,235
because you are on the surface
of a celestial body.

112
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:17,760
The whole Apollo program continued,

113
00:06:17,761 --> 00:06:21,760
with Apollo 12, 13--
that didn't reach the Moon, as you know--

114
00:06:21,761 --> 00:06:24,250
14, 15, 16, and 17.

115
00:06:24,251 --> 00:06:26,720
On the right-hand side,
you have Apollo 16.

116
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:28,720
It's Charlie Duke,

117
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:32,720
the lunar module pilot spacewalking
on the surface of the Moon,

118
00:06:32,721 --> 00:06:36,721
and at that time--
it started already with Apollo 15--

119
00:06:37,311 --> 00:06:43,000
NASA developed technically, and assembled,

120
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:49,150
a lunar jeep,
an electrically-driven lunar jeep

121
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:52,420
that was carried on these last missions
of the Apollo program,

122
00:06:52,421 --> 00:06:53,790
and you see it here.

123
00:06:53,791 --> 00:06:56,110
It allowed the crew to go further away,

124
00:06:56,111 --> 00:06:58,560
from the lunar module landing point,

125
00:06:58,561 --> 00:07:01,521
and hadn't been possible
on the previous missions.

126
00:07:02,845 --> 00:07:04,154
For the Shuttle program,

127
00:07:04,155 --> 00:07:05,724
NASA developed a new spacesuit,

128
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:09,204
the so-called EMU,
Extravehicular Mobility Unit,

129
00:07:09,205 --> 00:07:10,505
and you see it here,

130
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:14,659
the first spacewalk
out of the Space Shuttle

131
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:18,660
on the sixth Shuttle mission
in April, 1983.

132
00:07:18,667 --> 00:07:22,042
Story Musgrave and Don Peterson
were the two crew members,

133
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:26,019
and you see the portable 
life support system, like a backpack,

134
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:28,769
at the back of every astronaut,

135
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,329
and, by the way, you see here,
a safety tether.

136
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:35,329
Of course, all of these spacewalks,
were always tethered.

137
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,849
There was no propulsion system
on the astronaut,

138
00:07:37,850 --> 00:07:40,620
and he or she had to be tethered
to the spaceship.

139
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:44,093
NASA developed then the so-called
Manned Maneuvering Unit.

140
00:07:44,093 --> 00:07:48,556
It's a small personal spaceship
allowing a spacewalker

141
00:07:48,556 --> 00:07:51,369
to take it out of the payload bay

142
00:07:51,369 --> 00:07:54,098
and then move away from the Shuttle
being untethered.

143
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:57,347
We will talk more about
the Manned Maneuvering Unit,

144
00:07:57,347 --> 00:07:58,786
later, in a later video,

145
00:07:58,786 --> 00:08:02,244
but this is a great picture
of Bruce McCandless,

146
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:05,832
on the first flight
of the Manned Maneuvering Unit, in 1984.

147
00:08:07,372 --> 00:08:12,729
The first woman spacewalk was done
by Svetlana Savitskaya, in July 1984.

148
00:08:13,519 --> 00:08:16,662
So, again, the Soviets marked

149
00:08:16,662 --> 00:08:20,352
the first year
with the first woman spacewalker.

150
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:23,104
You see
the pretty large life support system

151
00:08:23,104 --> 00:08:25,280
on the right-hand side.

152
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,968
Again, it's an autonomous spacesuit
without an umbilical,

153
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:35,163
and all of the life support is brought
from this life support system in the back.

154
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:38,226
This is the first ISS spacewalk

155
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:42,652
on the Shuttle mission STS-88
in December, 1998.

156
00:08:42,652 --> 00:08:48,099
We had an American NASA astronaut
Jerry Ross, and Jim Newman,

157
00:08:48,749 --> 00:08:50,324
two spacewalkers,

158
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:52,210
and this was in conjunction

159
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:57,146
with the mating of the first US element
Node 1 of the Unity node

160
00:08:57,146 --> 00:08:59,301
to the Zarya Russian module.

161
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:02,884
And these two spacewalkers
performed two spacewalks

162
00:09:02,884 --> 00:09:06,903
in order to do the mating
of cables and various lines

163
00:09:06,903 --> 00:09:10,257
between the two first units
of the International Space Station.

164
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:14,809
Now, some details I can show you
on the right-hand side:

165
00:09:14,809 --> 00:09:18,532
you see that in front of his chest,

166
00:09:18,532 --> 00:09:21,015
we have a so-called mini workstation

167
00:09:21,015 --> 00:09:23,121
that it attached at this point here,

168
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:27,787
and this allowed the crew member
wearing the EMU,

169
00:09:27,787 --> 00:09:30,218
the Extravehicular Mobility Unit of NASA

170
00:09:30,218 --> 00:09:32,741
to store a certain number of equipment.

171
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:36,676
And you see here, for instance,
the power tool called the PGT,

172
00:09:36,676 --> 00:09:38,396
the pistol grip tool.

173
00:09:38,396 --> 00:09:41,159
Another interesting detail
is this feature here:

174
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,595
this is the so-called semi-rigid tether.

175
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:46,597
You could attach the end of the tether
to the structure,

176
00:09:46,597 --> 00:09:50,040
and then you could tighten them both
in order to make this tether rigid.

177
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:52,530
So it was allowing you, as a crew member,

178
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:56,869
to be stabilized in a given location
to perform a certain task.

179
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:01,570
And this is me, on STS-103,

180
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,670
the third servicing mission
of the Hubble Space Telescope.

181
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:09,730
I had the pleasure to perform
EVA number 2, out of 3,

182
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,222
together with Mike Foale.

183
00:10:11,222 --> 00:10:14,001
We spent about eight hours
and 10 minutes outside

184
00:10:15,141 --> 00:10:19,260
to, on one hand, install a new computer
on the Hubble Space Telescope

185
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:21,845
and exchange
one of the fine guidance sensors,

186
00:10:21,845 --> 00:10:23,882
fine guidance sensor number 2.

187
00:10:23,882 --> 00:10:25,765
And here I am, in the payload bay,

188
00:10:25,765 --> 00:10:30,294
I have my feet locked in the structure
of the payload bay,

189
00:10:30,294 --> 00:10:34,356
and I'm using my two hands
to unbolt, to remove some bolts

190
00:10:34,356 --> 00:10:37,420
on this firm, stabilized container

191
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:40,431
that contained a new computer for Hubble.

192
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:44,070
did you see I have
also this famous pistol grip tool

193
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:45,570
that I mentioned before.

194
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:50,068
What is interesting is that we had
the payload oriented to the Earth.

195
00:10:50,068 --> 00:10:54,316
You see the reflection of the Earth
on the upper part of my visor.

196
00:10:54,316 --> 00:10:57,153
So I had the head toward the Earth,

197
00:10:57,153 --> 00:11:00,025
but what is interesting also
is that we always had the feeling

198
00:11:00,025 --> 00:11:01,977
that down, where our feet are,

199
00:11:01,977 --> 00:11:03,334
was not at all perturbed

200
00:11:03,334 --> 00:11:06,656
by the fact that I had the Earth
above me, and I'm upside down,

201
00:11:06,656 --> 00:11:08,984
for me, down, was where my feet were.

202
00:11:08,984 --> 00:11:11,251
We spent quite some time outside;

203
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:12,746
we had some problems,

204
00:11:12,746 --> 00:11:14,837
the spacewalk was planned
for about seven hours,

205
00:11:14,837 --> 00:11:18,873
but we had difficulties inserting
the new fine guiding sensor,

206
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:22,176
so the spacewalk lasted
eight hours and ten minutes,

207
00:11:22,176 --> 00:11:24,139
which was relatively close to the limit.

208
00:11:24,139 --> 00:11:26,348
The limit is approximately
eight and a half hours,

209
00:11:26,348 --> 00:11:28,679
in terms of
the electrical power available,

210
00:11:28,679 --> 00:11:31,900
in the life support system,
portable life support system,

211
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:34,006
and also oxygen available.

212
00:11:34,756 --> 00:11:37,513
We've had, of course, Russian spacewalks,

213
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:39,808
or Soviet spacewalks,
and Russian spacewalks,

214
00:11:39,808 --> 00:11:41,267
and the US spacewalks,

215
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,873
but the Chinese did that too,

216
00:11:42,873 --> 00:11:46,851
and in September 2008, they had
their first spacewalk.

217
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:49,381
You see a picture on the right-hand side

218
00:11:50,121 --> 00:11:53,479
in the vicinity
of the Tiangong Space Station,

219
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,024
Tiangong 1 Space Station,

220
00:11:55,024 --> 00:11:56,638
and you see the Chinese flag.

221
00:11:56,638 --> 00:11:58,208
So that's really a Chinese spacewalk.

222
00:11:59,085 --> 00:12:01,195
Well, spacewalks normally go well

223
00:12:01,195 --> 00:12:05,082
when there is a lot of support
from the crew on board of the spaceship,

224
00:12:05,082 --> 00:12:06,807
whether it's the Shuttle in the past

225
00:12:06,807 --> 00:12:08,888
or the International Space Station now,

226
00:12:08,888 --> 00:12:10,937
and if there is also support
from the ground,

227
00:12:10,937 --> 00:12:14,912
The ground has a lot of data
received by telemetry,

228
00:12:14,912 --> 00:12:17,038
and they can monitor what's going on.

229
00:12:17,038 --> 00:12:19,424
They've also TV pictures in real time,

230
00:12:19,424 --> 00:12:22,482
so it's a very, very controlled exercise,

231
00:12:22,482 --> 00:12:24,925
but sometimes there are problems,
technical problems.

232
00:12:24,925 --> 00:12:27,296
And on a recent spacewalk

233
00:12:27,296 --> 00:12:30,759
by ESA astronaut Luca Parmitano,
from Italy,

234
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:34,031
on July 16, 2013,

235
00:12:35,261 --> 00:12:37,618
after a few hours of spacewalk,

236
00:12:38,048 --> 00:12:40,683
we had a problem with the water leak

237
00:12:40,683 --> 00:12:46,326
inside the helmet
of Luca Parmitano's spacesuit.

238
00:12:46,326 --> 00:12:48,847
And this was obviously,
a very dangerous situation

239
00:12:48,847 --> 00:12:53,099
because, if you have too much water
in the helmet,

240
00:12:53,099 --> 00:12:55,443
then you may have a problem
with breathing.

241
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:57,467
It was a pretty tough situation,

242
00:12:57,467 --> 00:13:04,415
and the ground requested the crew
to go back to the airlock pretty rapidly,

243
00:13:04,415 --> 00:13:05,643
which they did,

244
00:13:05,643 --> 00:13:07,652
and Luca's was OK,

245
00:13:07,652 --> 00:13:10,305
but it was a tough situation,

246
00:13:10,565 --> 00:13:14,608
and an indication that although,
again, most of the times, things go well,

247
00:13:14,608 --> 00:13:16,245
sometimes, you have problems,

248
00:13:16,245 --> 00:13:17,691
and it's the training,

249
00:13:17,691 --> 00:13:21,934
and the huge support of various people
with a lot of knowledge about the system

250
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:24,120
that can save the situation.

251
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,282
Luca Parmitano is a superman in space.

252
00:13:27,282 --> 00:13:30,993
But recently, on January 15, 2016,

253
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:33,901
we had a spacewalk of two Tims:

254
00:13:33,901 --> 00:13:36,078
Tim Kopra of NASA,

255
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:40,727
and Tim Peake, British astronaut
of the European Space Agency.

256
00:13:40,727 --> 00:13:44,118
For Tim Peake it was his first spacewalk.

257
00:13:45,168 --> 00:13:48,412
They went out of the airlock,
and they started to work

258
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:51,339
according to what they had to do.

259
00:13:51,339 --> 00:13:55,759
However, we, again, had a problem,
with some water leaking

260
00:13:55,759 --> 00:14:00,062
inside the helmet of Tim Kopra.

261
00:14:00,062 --> 00:14:03,705
So the spacewalk was shortened,

262
00:14:03,705 --> 00:14:05,961
it lasted only four hours,

263
00:14:05,961 --> 00:14:08,243
and they could accomplish
most of their tasks,

264
00:14:08,243 --> 00:14:09,504
but still,

265
00:14:10,774 --> 00:14:13,875
the EMUs are becoming old,

266
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,599
this has been used
during the Shuttle Program,

267
00:14:15,599 --> 00:14:17,405
it's of course refurbished,

268
00:14:17,405 --> 00:14:19,757
and maintained
in the best conditions as possible,

269
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:21,769
but obviously, there is some work needed

270
00:14:21,769 --> 00:14:24,706
in order to ensure the safety
of the spacewalking astronauts

271
00:14:24,706 --> 00:14:25,845
in the future,

272
00:14:25,845 --> 00:14:27,392
using the EMU.

273
00:14:27,392 --> 00:14:30,458
On the left-hand side,
you see Tim Peake still in the airlock.

274
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,949
You see the British flag
on his left shoulder.

275
00:14:32,949 --> 00:14:35,566
Obviously this is Tim Peake
and not Tim Kopra.

276
00:14:35,566 --> 00:14:38,087
You see also, the two floodlights

277
00:14:38,087 --> 00:14:40,880
on the both sides
of the upper part of this helmet

278
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,678
to illuminate the place of work
during the orbital nights.

279
00:14:43,678 --> 00:14:46,967
And close to his right hand
you see the so-called SCU,

280
00:14:46,967 --> 00:14:49,302
the Service and Cooling Umbilical;

281
00:14:49,302 --> 00:14:51,823
as long as the astronauts
are in the airlock,

282
00:14:52,893 --> 00:14:54,543
they wear this umbilical

283
00:14:54,543 --> 00:14:59,280
that provides them with cooling water,
and oxygen, and electrical power,

284
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,883
and communication,

285
00:15:00,883 --> 00:15:03,630
and is detached shortly
before they come out of the airlock

286
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,390
through the outer hatch.
