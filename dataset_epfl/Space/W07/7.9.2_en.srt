1
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:11,326
(laughter)

2
00:00:11,327 --> 00:00:13,064
So, what was the funniest situation

3
00:00:13,065 --> 00:00:15,103
you remember during your space missions?

4
00:00:15,723 --> 00:00:18,348
Well, there were many very serious parts,

5
00:00:18,349 --> 00:00:20,587
and there were a few
funny parts, I must say.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:23,733
One of the very funny parts

7
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:26,456
was on the first
servicing mission of Hubble.

8
00:00:26,457 --> 00:00:28,180
We were seven crew members on board,

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:30,788
and one of the crew members

10
00:00:30,789 --> 00:00:33,548
was believing very strongly
in extraterrestrials,

11
00:00:33,549 --> 00:00:37,335
and he thought he had the capability

12
00:00:37,336 --> 00:00:40,364
to communicate with extraterrestrials.

13
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:42,581
So sometimes he was isolating himself

14
00:00:42,582 --> 00:00:43,823
in a corner of the spaceship,

15
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:45,997
and all the others were going
to another corner.

16
00:00:45,998 --> 00:00:48,925
It's a small spaceship--
between the cockpit and the mid-deck

17
00:00:48,926 --> 00:00:51,271
of the Space Shuttle
there's not that much volume.

18
00:00:51,391 --> 00:00:54,456
But when this--
I'm not going to mention him,

19
00:00:54,457 --> 00:00:56,515
mention his name--
but when this crew member

20
00:00:56,635 --> 00:00:59,425
wanted to have communication
with extraterrestrials,

21
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,974
we just left him alone,
and we went to the other compartment.

22
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:05,693
And when he said he had finished
his communication

23
00:01:05,694 --> 00:01:07,093
then we went back to him.

24
00:01:07,094 --> 00:01:09,594
We don't really know
what they were talking about,

25
00:01:09,595 --> 00:01:11,849
but the mission
was successful, eventually,

26
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,158
maybe there was some help
provided by extraterrestrials,

27
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,625
but anyway, that first
servicing mission of Hubble,

28
00:01:17,626 --> 00:01:22,335
in December, 1963, STS-61,
was a total success--

29
00:01:22,341 --> 00:01:25,439
thanks, maybe,
to that communication capability

30
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:27,286
of this particular crew member.

31
00:01:31,349 --> 00:01:33,279
Why did I decide to teach?

32
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,326
Going in space is a very powerful
and very strong experience.

33
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:41,049
It is something that is really
touching you very deeply.

34
00:01:42,173 --> 00:01:43,249
This, on one hand.

35
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,260
On the other hand,
you learn so many things

36
00:01:45,261 --> 00:01:47,778
that it would be unfair
to keep this for yourself.

37
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:50,985
So, for me, I decided to teach,
because I wanted to share.

38
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:54,353
I thought it was far too much
for me to keep it for myself,

39
00:01:54,354 --> 00:01:56,650
whether it was, again, the emotions

40
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:59,173
and the beauty of the scenery,

41
00:01:59,174 --> 00:02:01,069
or whether it was
all the technical aspects,

42
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,137
that we were exposed to
during the whole training

43
00:02:03,138 --> 00:02:04,813
and then during the mission itself.

44
00:02:04,933 --> 00:02:07,849
We learned so many things;
I could not keep it for myself.

45
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,770
So I decided to teach,
and bring the message to students,

46
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,007
and also, on the occasion of lectures,

47
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:16,696
not only to the students
but to the public in general.

48
00:02:23,085 --> 00:02:25,706
Well, on the first mission you discover

49
00:02:25,707 --> 00:02:27,850
a completely new environment.

50
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:31,335
I remember being a little bit worried
before the first mission,

51
00:02:31,336 --> 00:02:33,357
because I did not know the environment.

52
00:02:33,358 --> 00:02:35,282
Despite the fact that in the simulators

53
00:02:35,283 --> 00:02:37,486
they were trying
to reproduce the environment

54
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:41,705
as well as possible,
it was never really the same,

55
00:02:41,706 --> 00:02:43,419
especially the absence of gravity,

56
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:46,905
which you cannot really
simulate easily on the Earth.

57
00:02:46,906 --> 00:02:50,198
You can do it for a short time
in an airplane,

58
00:02:50,199 --> 00:02:51,778
following a parabolic trajectory.

59
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:54,746
You can simulate it to a certain degree
when you're underwater,

60
00:02:54,866 --> 00:02:56,859
and you train for space walking.

61
00:02:57,419 --> 00:03:00,482
After your first mission
there are a lot of things that you know.

62
00:03:00,483 --> 00:03:03,115
There were big question marks
before that first mission,

63
00:03:03,235 --> 00:03:06,404
and many of them are already answered.

64
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:12,950
And you also have learned
strategies of handling

65
00:03:12,951 --> 00:03:16,191
the absence-of-gravity environment,
which is not at all obvious,

66
00:03:16,192 --> 00:03:19,715
because we have no experience
of this here on the Earth.

67
00:03:20,073 --> 00:03:23,849
So, I had the feeling
I was significantly--

68
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,952
not only the feeling,

69
00:03:24,953 --> 00:03:27,282
but I definitely was
significantly more efficient

70
00:03:27,283 --> 00:03:29,434
on the second mission,
than on the first one.

71
00:03:29,435 --> 00:03:30,888
The big step, I would say,

72
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:32,947
is between the first one
and the second one,

73
00:03:33,067 --> 00:03:36,130
because of these question marks
being no longer question marks.

74
00:03:36,305 --> 00:03:41,090
Then I did four total, and obviously
on number three and four

75
00:03:41,091 --> 00:03:42,969
I had gathered more experience.

76
00:03:42,970 --> 00:03:44,884
I did space walking on my very last one,

77
00:03:45,004 --> 00:03:47,838
which was, of course,
something new, a new experience.

78
00:03:47,839 --> 00:03:49,714
But the big jump is really

79
00:03:49,715 --> 00:03:51,629
between the first one
and the second one.

80
00:03:51,749 --> 00:03:53,817
The first one, a lot of question marks,

81
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:57,517
and they were, happily,
resolved during the first mission.

82
00:03:57,518 --> 00:04:01,022
And I could use what I had learned
on that first one,

83
00:04:01,023 --> 00:04:06,630
in making myself more efficient,
and being more productive

84
00:04:06,631 --> 00:04:09,230
on the second and subsequent missions.

85
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:17,789
Well, why do I teach
a course here at EPFL,

86
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:19,608
Space Mission Design &amp; Operations?

87
00:04:19,728 --> 00:04:23,979
I think after you have experienced
something so deep, so profound

88
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,337
and so fascinating as I could,

89
00:04:27,338 --> 00:04:31,328
you have to pass a message.

90
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:34,973
I try to do it to schools.
I do it to the public,

91
00:04:34,974 --> 00:04:37,842
but doing it to students in university

92
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:41,460
seems to me a good use of my time.

93
00:04:41,461 --> 00:04:43,999
And in the wake
of what I could experience,

94
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,340
I think this is the best way

95
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,680
to bring a certain profit and advantage

96
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:51,206
to what I could experience.

97
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,887
In Switzerland, we have been
very few to go through this,

98
00:04:54,007 --> 00:04:56,075
I think I'm the only one, so far.

99
00:04:56,076 --> 00:04:59,312
Switzerland is a small country.
We only have one astronaut.

100
00:04:59,313 --> 00:05:00,749
We'll have more in the future,

101
00:05:00,869 --> 00:05:04,376
but we don't need
many astronauts in Europe.

102
00:05:04,377 --> 00:05:07,009
There are many nations,
and small nations are not really

103
00:05:07,129 --> 00:05:10,702
pushed forward
as the providers of astronauts.

104
00:05:10,703 --> 00:05:13,322
I had this huge privilege and chance

105
00:05:13,323 --> 00:05:17,254
to be the first group selected in 1978,

106
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:20,018
and now I feel
the responsibility, really,

107
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:22,813
to capitalize on what I learned,

108
00:05:22,814 --> 00:05:25,962
and I would say translate,
in engineering terms,

109
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:29,581
what I learned in my training
over there at NASA, for 25 years--

110
00:05:29,582 --> 00:05:31,962
I spent quite a lot of time over there--

111
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:34,140
and then pass the message
to the students.

112
00:05:34,538 --> 00:05:37,379
If I'm able in this way
to motivate a few students

113
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:41,757
to either go and work
in the space business, space industry,

114
00:05:41,758 --> 00:05:46,637
in the future, or at least have
an interest in space activities,

115
00:05:46,638 --> 00:05:49,151
and whatever they do
in the future, as engineers,

116
00:05:49,152 --> 00:05:52,694
that they can try to bring forward

117
00:05:52,695 --> 00:05:55,511
their interest, motivation and knowledge

118
00:05:55,512 --> 00:05:59,361
for the service of space exploration
and utilization of space,

119
00:05:59,362 --> 00:06:02,319
then I think I've fulfilled my goal,

120
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:05,803
which is, again,
to make what I learned,

121
00:06:05,804 --> 00:06:08,903
so my experience,
profitable to students,

122
00:06:08,904 --> 00:06:12,124
and to the public,
and to schoolchildren also.

123
00:06:16,815 --> 00:06:19,889
What was my biggest fear
during my space missions?

124
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,586
Well, it's not what one might think.

125
00:06:23,587 --> 00:06:27,731
It's not the fear of, I don't know,
the fireball after liftoff.

126
00:06:27,732 --> 00:06:30,439
It's not really
that kind of fear that we have.

127
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:33,052
We are slightly worried
during the ascent,

128
00:06:33,053 --> 00:06:37,118
especially the first stage
of ascent of the Space Shuttle,

129
00:06:37,119 --> 00:06:39,755
when we are attached
with the two solid rocket boosters,

130
00:06:39,756 --> 00:06:42,055
which of course
have been the cause

131
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:43,956
of the Challenger accident.

132
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,993
So there is a slight worry there,
but it's not fear.

133
00:06:47,994 --> 00:06:50,016
In fact, during the ascent,

134
00:06:50,017 --> 00:06:53,728
depending on the position
that we have on board the Shuttle.

135
00:06:53,729 --> 00:06:56,052
Of course the Commander
has the highest position,

136
00:06:56,053 --> 00:06:57,839
the highest responsibility.

137
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:59,936
The second in command is the Pilot,

138
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,619
then we have the Flight Engineer,

139
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,113
or the so-called Mission Specialist #2,

140
00:07:04,114 --> 00:07:05,630
sitting between the Commander and Pilot,

141
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:08,215
who has some responsibilities
for the ascent,

142
00:07:08,216 --> 00:07:09,604
mainly if there are problems.

143
00:07:09,724 --> 00:07:12,834
He's supposed to help
resolve the problem,

144
00:07:12,835 --> 00:07:15,120
mainly in terms of the management

145
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:17,373
of the systems on board the Shuttle.

146
00:07:17,374 --> 00:07:19,825
And the others
are less involved in the ascent,

147
00:07:19,826 --> 00:07:22,973
they are more there
"for the ride," in a way.

148
00:07:23,765 --> 00:07:26,681
Typically, the space walkers
spend a lot of time

149
00:07:26,682 --> 00:07:29,266
training for space walks,
so they don't spend much time

150
00:07:29,386 --> 00:07:31,795
training for the ascent
and the entry phase,

151
00:07:31,796 --> 00:07:33,910
so they cannot occupy a position

152
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,589
with high responsibility
during these phases.

153
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,574
But anyway, whether you have
a high-responsibility position,

154
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:43,286
like the Commander,
or the ones who are in the mid-deck,

155
00:07:43,287 --> 00:07:46,781
who have no responsibility
at all for the ascent,

156
00:07:46,782 --> 00:07:48,473
there is a little bit of a concern

157
00:07:48,474 --> 00:07:50,053
for the first part of the ascent,

158
00:07:50,173 --> 00:07:52,133
and the rest of it, but it's not fear.

159
00:07:52,395 --> 00:07:54,462
If I have to answer
the question about fear,

160
00:07:54,463 --> 00:07:57,400
for me, I had the fear sometimes

161
00:07:57,401 --> 00:08:01,648
of doing something really stupid,
something dumb

162
00:08:01,649 --> 00:08:04,431
because I'm a human being,
so I can make mistakes

163
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:07,089
something dumb
that would have as a consequence

164
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:10,640
that a mission goal cannot be reached,
mainly in space walking.

165
00:08:11,152 --> 00:08:13,640
You space walk,
there's a little room for error,

166
00:08:13,641 --> 00:08:15,643
but you could possibly
do something dumb,

167
00:08:15,644 --> 00:08:18,623
and then <i>Bam!,</i>
you can't really accomplish

168
00:08:18,624 --> 00:08:19,773
the goal of the mission,

169
00:08:19,893 --> 00:08:22,176
or maybe you can only
reach part of these goals,

170
00:08:22,177 --> 00:08:23,948
because you have done something dumb.

171
00:08:24,068 --> 00:08:30,088
So sometimes I had a fear of that.

172
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,908
What was the most difficult situation?

173
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,335
Well, I was fortunate
we never had huge problems

174
00:08:34,336 --> 00:08:38,121
on my four missions,
and a total of 43 days in space.

175
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:43,032
Where we had most of the problems
were in the payloads,

176
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:45,042
or the equipment
that we were working on,

177
00:08:45,043 --> 00:08:51,292
whether it was Hubble,
or the tethered satellites.

178
00:08:51,802 --> 00:08:53,386
We had problems in these areas,

179
00:08:53,387 --> 00:08:57,875
but we never had, in these 43 days,
including ascent and entry,

180
00:08:57,876 --> 00:09:00,042
a big problem
at the level of the Shuttle.

181
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:05,068
I would say that
the most difficult situation

182
00:09:05,069 --> 00:09:08,070
was on the tethered satellite,
on the second flight

183
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:12,356
of the tethered satellite,
the TSS-1R mission, STS-75,

184
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:17,390
in February-March of 1996,
when we had the tether break.

185
00:09:19,162 --> 00:09:22,270
This was a very feared situation,
the tether break,

186
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,034
because you can imagine,
you have the Space Shuttle,

187
00:09:24,035 --> 00:09:25,509
you have a 20 km-long tether

188
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,096
between the Shuttle and the satellite,

189
00:09:28,097 --> 00:09:31,397
the tether being more or less
along the local vertical,

190
00:09:31,398 --> 00:09:33,583
with maybe some oscillations.

191
00:09:33,584 --> 00:09:36,296
And we had practiced a lot

192
00:09:36,297 --> 00:09:40,156
the response of the crew
to a tether break,

193
00:09:40,157 --> 00:09:42,034
whether it was at the level
of the satellite,

194
00:09:42,035 --> 00:09:43,470
or whether it was
somewhere in the middle,

195
00:09:43,471 --> 00:09:45,317
between the satellite and the Shuttle,

196
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:48,091
or whether it was
at the level of the deploy itself.

197
00:09:48,092 --> 00:09:51,519
You can imagine,
if we had had a tether break

198
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:54,300
at the level of the satellite,
or very far away from us,

199
00:09:54,301 --> 00:09:56,269
because of the elasticity of the tether,

200
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,420
the tether would have come back to us

201
00:09:58,421 --> 00:10:00,348
and would have piled in the cargo bay.

202
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:04,272
The Shuttle was pretty much
with the belly to the Earth,

203
00:10:04,273 --> 00:10:08,646
and the payload bay up,
so the tether was above the payload bay,

204
00:10:08,647 --> 00:10:10,717
and if it had broken up there

205
00:10:10,718 --> 00:10:12,489
it would have piled in the cargo bay.

206
00:10:12,609 --> 00:10:14,888
That could have been
a dangerous situation,

207
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,615
because it could have possibly

208
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,590
prevented the doors
from being shut down,

209
00:10:18,591 --> 00:10:22,455
except if we would have gone out
to do a space walk

210
00:10:22,456 --> 00:10:25,958
in order to rearrange the tether,
or cut it and let it go.

211
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:27,299
There were a lot of options.

212
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:28,784
But when we had a tether break,

213
00:10:28,904 --> 00:10:33,560
for me it was quite a stressful moment.

214
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:36,072
We saw we had a tether break,

215
00:10:36,073 --> 00:10:38,705
because the tension of the tether
suddenly went to zero,

216
00:10:38,825 --> 00:10:42,118
and then we looked out
and we saw something strange.

217
00:10:42,119 --> 00:10:43,894
The tether was withering away from us,

218
00:10:43,895 --> 00:10:46,710
but it had a kind of a helicoidal shape

219
00:10:46,751 --> 00:10:50,096
because the break had taken place
at the level of the deployer.

220
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:52,394
Fortunately, that was
the best situation possible

221
00:10:52,514 --> 00:10:54,830
out of these three situations
I mentioned

222
00:10:54,831 --> 00:10:57,342
on top, in the middle,
or on the bottom.

223
00:10:57,343 --> 00:11:02,624
But anyway, that was a very short,
difficult moment that we had,

224
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,697
and we had to decide rapidly
what to do.

225
00:11:04,698 --> 00:11:08,252
Again, fortunately it was not dangerous,
but it could have been.

226
00:11:08,253 --> 00:11:12,915
being a tether break that had
a whole spectrum of possibilities,

227
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,279
some of which being very dangerous.

228
00:11:20,229 --> 00:11:22,470
What is the most difficult thing
to adapt to?

229
00:11:23,323 --> 00:11:26,467
I must say, there is nothing
really very difficult to adapt to,

230
00:11:26,468 --> 00:11:28,041
because we are so well-prepared.

231
00:11:28,042 --> 00:11:31,008
The training for, typically,
a 10-day mission

232
00:11:31,009 --> 00:11:34,539
with the Space Shuttle
lasted about one year,

233
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,232
together with the rest of the crew,
so seven crew members total,

234
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,773
and we were really, really well-prepared.

235
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:47,345
The painful,
or difficult situation, mentally,

236
00:11:47,346 --> 00:11:49,452
comes from the fact
that if something happens

237
00:11:49,453 --> 00:11:51,846
and you are not prepared
to respond properly to it,

238
00:11:51,966 --> 00:11:54,330
and we were really well-prepared.

239
00:11:54,854 --> 00:11:57,647
The most difficult thing
to adapt to, I would say,

240
00:11:57,648 --> 00:11:59,132
is probably the weightlessness.

241
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:02,368
It did not last too long a time,
but for a few hours,

242
00:12:02,369 --> 00:12:05,565
especially on the very first flight,
when for the first time

243
00:12:05,566 --> 00:12:08,471
you experience this long-duration
weightlessness.

244
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:11,233
We had done some flights in the KC-135,

245
00:12:11,234 --> 00:12:13,995
the zero-g airplane of NASA,
and we knew what it was

246
00:12:13,996 --> 00:12:17,731
to be weightless
for 15 seconds, or 20 seconds,

247
00:12:18,151 --> 00:12:20,134
but when you have main-engine cutoff,

248
00:12:20,135 --> 00:12:22,616
at the end of the 8-1/2-minutes
ascent into space

249
00:12:22,617 --> 00:12:24,706
with the Space Shuttle,
suddenly you are

250
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:27,117
with your launch and entry suit

251
00:12:27,118 --> 00:12:28,697
and your helmet and your gloves

252
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:30,852
you are suddenly exposed
to this zero gravity.

253
00:12:30,972 --> 00:12:33,477
I was thinking,
on my very first ascent,

254
00:12:33,478 --> 00:12:36,088
STS-46, in the summer of 1992,

255
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,453
I was thinking, "Claude,
are you really going to be able

256
00:12:38,454 --> 00:12:40,181
to work in these conditions?"

257
00:12:40,182 --> 00:12:42,879
Once you get rid
of your launch and entry suit,

258
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,426
and when you move away, also,

259
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:48,221
from the period where you don't
feel too well physically

260
00:12:48,222 --> 00:12:51,873
Pretty much like seasickness,
for a while.

261
00:12:52,381 --> 00:12:53,853
It doesn't happen to all.

262
00:12:53,854 --> 00:12:57,490
It happens to most of us
to a certain degree, but some of us,

263
00:12:57,491 --> 00:12:59,310
some of us astronauts don't have that.

264
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,120
I had a little bit of that.

265
00:13:01,257 --> 00:13:03,953
When you get rid of the launch
and entry suit, to take it out,

266
00:13:03,954 --> 00:13:06,777
and you are in light clothing,
you feel a little bit better,

267
00:13:06,897 --> 00:13:08,894
and meanwhile,
you have somewhat adapted

268
00:13:08,895 --> 00:13:11,308
to the way to move
from one place to the other,

269
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:14,324
and weightlessness--at the beginning,
you are completely clumsy.

270
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:16,559
You really have no idea how to operate

271
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,985
in this completely different environment.

272
00:13:18,986 --> 00:13:20,821
So I would say that that's probably

273
00:13:20,822 --> 00:13:22,593
the most difficult thing to adapt to,

274
00:13:22,713 --> 00:13:24,390
but it only lasts a few hours.

275
00:13:24,391 --> 00:13:27,946
The next day it was already much better,

276
00:13:27,947 --> 00:13:31,556
and after two or three days,
you really enjoy the weightlessness,

277
00:13:31,557 --> 00:13:33,663
but the adaptation
on your very first flight,

278
00:13:33,783 --> 00:13:35,610
for the first three hours, is tough.

279
00:13:39,584 --> 00:13:41,464
The zero-g flights we had performed

280
00:13:41,465 --> 00:13:44,600
were just for us to know
what weightlessness is.

281
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:47,455
It's like... you want to know
what a g-force is,

282
00:13:47,456 --> 00:13:50,024
that's why we had a ride in a centrifuge,

283
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:54,723
where we had exactly
the expected profile of the acceleration

284
00:13:54,724 --> 00:13:56,973
that we were going to have
on the Space Shuttle,

285
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:58,737
starting with about
a g and a half,

286
00:13:58,738 --> 00:14:00,862
and rising to about 2.2 g

287
00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:02,714
at solid rocket booster separation,

288
00:14:02,715 --> 00:14:05,335
and then going back down
to about a g and a half.

289
00:14:05,829 --> 00:14:08,413
This depends, of course,
on the thrust-to-weight ratio,

290
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:10,281
on one hand, and also
on the orientation

291
00:14:10,401 --> 00:14:12,875
of the spacecraft vs. the gravity vector.

292
00:14:13,076 --> 00:14:15,485
Then, after solid rocket
booster separation,

293
00:14:15,486 --> 00:14:16,914
it was again relatively low,

294
00:14:16,915 --> 00:14:18,749
then it was rising all the way to 3-g,

295
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:21,475
then for the last about
minute and a half of the ascent

296
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:24,132
we had 3-g longitude and acceleration.

297
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:28,163
So we had a centrifuge ride

298
00:14:28,164 --> 00:14:30,299
where the exact profile of acceleration

299
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,650
that we were going to have on the ascent

300
00:14:32,651 --> 00:14:35,553
to space and the Space Shuttle
was reproduced.

301
00:14:35,554 --> 00:14:40,914
So we knew about moderate,
or relatively high g-forces.

302
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:44,163
Anyway, we did a lot of training
in airplanes, the T-38s,

303
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:45,750
so 3-g was not a big deal,

304
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,602
although 3-g longitudinal
was very special,

305
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:51,872
because that's a velocity
added to the velocity,

306
00:14:51,873 --> 00:14:54,115
it's not the change in the direction
of the velocity vector,

307
00:14:54,116 --> 00:14:56,298
which is what causes acceleration

308
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:59,413
in a jet fighter, on a jet airplane,
when you do a tight turn.

309
00:14:59,961 --> 00:15:05,413
So above 1-g was well known,
so that was not a problem,

310
00:15:05,414 --> 00:15:07,906
but the zero-g, of course,
is very unusual.

311
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,754
You cannot easily get this on Earth,
except a trampoline

312
00:15:10,755 --> 00:15:14,441
you can get this for a second, maybe,

313
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:17,835
in between the acceleration period,
with a trampoline.

314
00:15:17,836 --> 00:15:20,827
And we had one or two flights
on the KC-135,

315
00:15:20,828 --> 00:15:24,956
to experience a series
of about 20-second zero-g periods

316
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:28,832
in the parabolas,
and then we had a pull-up

317
00:15:28,833 --> 00:15:32,223
at about 2-g, and then again
in the next parabola, 20 seconds.

318
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:35,152
So we had some kind of an idea
what a zero-g feels like,

319
00:15:35,153 --> 00:15:38,005
but when you are on a real space flight,

320
00:15:38,006 --> 00:15:39,633
and you get to main-engine cutoff,

321
00:15:39,634 --> 00:15:41,125
and suddenly you are on zero-g,

322
00:15:41,126 --> 00:15:44,254
but then that zero-g for ten days.

323
00:15:44,255 --> 00:15:45,714
And on your very first flight,

324
00:15:45,715 --> 00:15:48,965
when you've had very little exposure
to that in the past,

325
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:51,785
the little disturbance
that you have sometimes

326
00:15:51,786 --> 00:15:57,471
in your vestibular system,
causing some uneasy feeling.

327
00:15:58,459 --> 00:15:59,550
And you know you have to work,

328
00:15:59,551 --> 00:16:01,917
because you have the crew activity plan,

329
00:16:01,918 --> 00:16:03,717
and you're supposed to do something.

330
00:16:03,718 --> 00:16:05,802
That was tough, on the very first flight.

331
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:07,622
But the next flight, it's much easier,

332
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:10,613
because you know that even
if you don't feel perfectly well,

333
00:16:10,614 --> 00:16:13,243
you know that you are going
to be fine in a few hours,

334
00:16:13,244 --> 00:16:15,648
or at least the next day
you are going to be okay.

335
00:16:20,149 --> 00:16:22,446
I wouldn't say that it was really
an achievement.

336
00:16:22,566 --> 00:16:25,437
The achievement is the achievement
of the program in general.

337
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:30,450
The Apollo program was
an unbelievable achievement,

338
00:16:30,451 --> 00:16:33,493
and it reached very high goals
in terms of the difficulty

339
00:16:33,494 --> 00:16:35,720
of the objective,
and getting to the Moon.

340
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:39,505
It was really an unbelievable
achievement in the '60s.

341
00:16:39,506 --> 00:16:43,242
The Shuttle program
was also a great achievement.

342
00:16:43,474 --> 00:16:49,215
For me, personally,
I had dreams, and goals,

343
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:54,001
and passion for a few things
when I was a kid.

344
00:16:54,002 --> 00:16:57,552
I had a passion for aviation.
I had a passion for stars.

345
00:16:58,032 --> 00:16:59,616
I was an amateur astronomer.

346
00:16:59,617 --> 00:17:02,045
I was building airplane models.

347
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:08,323
I was witnessing the beginning
of the space program.

348
00:17:08,324 --> 00:17:13,513
In 1957, when Sputnik 1 was launched,
I was 13 years of age,

349
00:17:13,515 --> 00:17:16,867
so I was a teenager,

350
00:17:16,867 --> 00:17:19,657
and I was marveling
at what was happening.

351
00:17:19,936 --> 00:17:21,804
I remember that a short time afterwards

352
00:17:21,924 --> 00:17:26,321
the satellite Echo was launched.
It was a big sphere,

353
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:29,447
a very, very simple
communications satellite

354
00:17:29,448 --> 00:17:31,710
reflecting the radiation as well,

355
00:17:31,711 --> 00:17:34,754
electromagnetic radiation sent to it,

356
00:17:34,755 --> 00:17:36,717
in the visible part
of the spectrum, also,

357
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:38,106
so it was visible in the sky,

358
00:17:38,226 --> 00:17:40,378
as a pretty bright object,
moving rapidly.

359
00:17:40,379 --> 00:17:42,341
I was about 15 years of age at that time,

360
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,566
and I was fascinated by that.

361
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:46,909
For me it was a big inspiration.

362
00:17:47,029 --> 00:17:49,452
I remember, we were on vacation
with my family

363
00:17:49,453 --> 00:17:51,747
in the Swiss mountains,
and I had a camera,

364
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:53,232
and I was taking long exposures

365
00:17:53,352 --> 00:17:56,214
to see the trail of Echo
passing in the sky.

366
00:17:56,351 --> 00:17:59,185
So I had a fascination for the sky.

367
00:17:59,186 --> 00:18:01,100
I had a fascination for airplanes, also.

368
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,793
I became an Air Force pilot,

369
00:18:02,794 --> 00:18:05,170
and did this for about 30 years,

370
00:18:05,171 --> 00:18:07,939
flying various jet airplanes

371
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:10,318
in the squadron of the Swiss Air Force.

372
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:12,898
But for me, when I was witnessing
what was happening

373
00:18:12,899 --> 00:18:15,366
in the Soviet Union,
and in the United States

374
00:18:15,367 --> 00:18:18,904
in space exploration,
I thought well, this is amazing,

375
00:18:18,905 --> 00:18:21,231
this is fantastic,
but it's not for a Swiss,

376
00:18:21,232 --> 00:18:23,065
a Swiss cannot do that.

377
00:18:23,066 --> 00:18:26,692
And it's only in the mid '70s,

378
00:18:26,693 --> 00:18:30,295
when I was just after 30 years of age,

379
00:18:30,296 --> 00:18:33,183
that I realized that
the European Space Agency

380
00:18:33,184 --> 00:18:36,617
was going to come in, also,
on the human space flight,

381
00:18:36,618 --> 00:18:38,841
with the participation
in the Shuttle program

382
00:18:38,842 --> 00:18:42,209
in the form of Spacelab,
and delivery of Spacelab

383
00:18:42,244 --> 00:18:45,352
and of experiments
and joint missions with Americans

384
00:18:45,353 --> 00:18:48,089
to use the space for scientific research,

385
00:18:48,090 --> 00:18:49,767
and at the same time, opportunity

386
00:18:49,768 --> 00:18:52,476
for European men and women
to become astronauts.

387
00:18:52,477 --> 00:18:53,674
So immediately I thought,

388
00:18:53,794 --> 00:18:56,156
"Well, that's something I want to do."

389
00:18:57,116 --> 00:19:02,419
I was happy that I had had
training in science, on one hand,

390
00:19:02,420 --> 00:19:04,612
being an astrophysicist,
but also in aviation,

391
00:19:04,613 --> 00:19:08,026
because joining NASA
and the Shuttle program,

392
00:19:08,027 --> 00:19:11,784
we were sent there, the three first
European astronauts

393
00:19:11,792 --> 00:19:14,167
Ulf Merbold, Wubbo Ockels and myself

394
00:19:14,177 --> 00:19:16,466
to Houston for Shuttle training.

395
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:20,388
Having been and being still
an aviator was a big plus,

396
00:19:20,389 --> 00:19:24,861
because flying the Shuttle was
the extension of an airplane

397
00:19:24,862 --> 00:19:27,757
going outside of the atmosphere,
and going on orbit,

398
00:19:27,758 --> 00:19:31,431
and carrying different things,
different goals in the mission,

399
00:19:31,432 --> 00:19:32,629
then coming back to Earth

400
00:19:32,749 --> 00:19:35,911
and gliding for a soft landing
on the runway.

401
00:19:37,408 --> 00:19:42,293
For me, I was the happiest
young man in the world,

402
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:44,746
going to Houston
and having this combination

403
00:19:44,747 --> 00:19:48,926
of my interest in aviation
and in space in general and astronomy

404
00:19:48,927 --> 00:19:51,436
satisfied in this training over there.

405
00:19:53,014 --> 00:19:55,579
I will say that it was a big achievement.

406
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,435
The achievement was outside of myself;

407
00:19:57,436 --> 00:19:59,829
the achievement was
the achievement of the program.

408
00:19:59,949 --> 00:20:02,726
I was just following my goals,
and working pretty hard

409
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:07,289
in order to not only satisfy
my interest in this field,

410
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,658
but also try to bring
my contribution to it.

411
00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:13,482
What was nice over there
at the Johnson Space Center at NASA

412
00:20:13,483 --> 00:20:15,732
is that outside
of the training for space flight

413
00:20:15,852 --> 00:20:18,398
we had job assignment,
and I worked for a while

414
00:20:18,399 --> 00:20:22,326
with engineers on Shuttle navigation,
in the early '80s,

415
00:20:22,327 --> 00:20:26,750
and the different ways we were going
to do precise navigation

416
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:31,085
of the Space Shuttle using TACAN,
which I used in aviation,

417
00:20:31,097 --> 00:20:33,011
but at that time
we thought of using them

418
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:36,599
also extensively for the Shuttle;
GPS was not yet existing.

419
00:20:37,047 --> 00:20:41,044
So I had the opportunity to learn a lot
about the Space Shuttle

420
00:20:41,045 --> 00:20:42,672
and about space flight in general,

421
00:20:42,792 --> 00:20:45,679
not only through the training
for the Space Shuttle,

422
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,644
but also through the job assignment.

423
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:52,544
The beginning of a bigger story?
I'm not so sure.

424
00:20:52,545 --> 00:20:57,958
This was, for me, a goal
that was slowly getting reached.

425
00:20:57,959 --> 00:21:01,454
Of course the ultimate goal,
which is the first space flight,

426
00:21:01,455 --> 00:21:05,244
and then subsequent space flights,
came for me quite a bit later.

427
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:09,621
It was 1992, so 12 years
after I came to Houston,

428
00:21:09,622 --> 00:21:12,049
so it took a while
until I got my first flight.

429
00:21:12,050 --> 00:21:14,730
There was, of course,
the Challenger accident in between,

430
00:21:14,850 --> 00:21:16,319
which delayed my first flight.

431
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:21,075
Then the '90s were the best period

432
00:21:21,076 --> 00:21:22,560
of the Space Shuttle operation,

433
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,989
because it was
after the Challenger accident

434
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:26,624
and before the Columbia accident,

435
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:29,441
and there were a lot of flights
accomplished during this time,

436
00:21:29,442 --> 00:21:31,643
and very, very productive
and very interesting,

437
00:21:31,644 --> 00:21:33,606
a lot of dynamics in the Shuttle program.

438
00:21:33,726 --> 00:21:36,655
I was privileged to fly
these four missions,

439
00:21:36,656 --> 00:21:38,822
and a total of 43 days in space

440
00:21:38,823 --> 00:21:41,432
during that glorious time
of the Space Shuttle.

441
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:50,111
What current or future projects drive me?

442
00:21:50,112 --> 00:21:52,548
Well, what I'm doing now,
teaching at EPFL,

443
00:21:52,549 --> 00:21:54,690
is something that satisfies me a lot,

444
00:21:54,691 --> 00:21:58,689
so my plan is to continue doing this
over the next few years.

445
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:00,985
Obviously, my course
is coming online now.

446
00:22:01,417 --> 00:22:03,914
I'm still giving the course
also <i>ex cathedra</i>,

447
00:22:03,915 --> 00:22:06,596
like a normal professor,
in front of a blackboard

448
00:22:06,597 --> 00:22:10,038
and with a PowerPoint slide
being projected.

449
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:14,575
My goal is really to continue
doing this for a few years still.

450
00:22:14,576 --> 00:22:18,999
As long as I feel I can
bring something to students,

451
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:21,702
to the academic community
here in Lausanne, and beyond,

452
00:22:21,703 --> 00:22:22,995
I will continue doing that.

453
00:22:22,996 --> 00:22:25,150
And also bringing the message
to other people,

454
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:27,797
to schools and to the public,
as I mentioned.

455
00:22:28,569 --> 00:22:31,130
I like to travel, also,

456
00:22:31,131 --> 00:22:34,930
and I spend a number of weeks

457
00:22:35,421 --> 00:22:38,583
traveling to various countries,

458
00:22:38,584 --> 00:22:40,510
and discovering new landscapes,

459
00:22:40,511 --> 00:22:43,971
and discovering new mentalities
and new people also.

460
00:22:43,972 --> 00:22:46,478
I am fascinated by travel.

461
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:48,728
Now, this is travel
on the surface of the Earth,

462
00:22:48,729 --> 00:22:50,643
although there is
some part of the travel

463
00:22:50,763 --> 00:22:53,817
which is in the atmosphere:
taking airliners to South America,

464
00:22:53,818 --> 00:22:57,265
or to Indonesia,
or to other places in the world.

465
00:22:57,266 --> 00:22:59,359
I enjoy travel a lot.

466
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:04,046
So for me, travel--
and when I travel, I try to, again,

467
00:23:04,047 --> 00:23:08,343
continue trying to bring
to my fellow travelers--

468
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:12,091
I normally travel in group,
sometimes as a guide or as a lecturer--

469
00:23:12,092 --> 00:23:13,494
I try to bring the message

470
00:23:13,495 --> 00:23:17,260
of the value of space exploration
and space utilization.

471
00:23:17,261 --> 00:23:19,876
So this is all part of the same goal.

472
00:23:20,596 --> 00:23:23,456
I went through something
that is really amazing,

473
00:23:23,457 --> 00:23:25,082
that few people on the planet Earth

474
00:23:25,083 --> 00:23:26,710
had the opportunity to go through,

475
00:23:26,711 --> 00:23:28,416
and I try to pass the message now,

476
00:23:28,417 --> 00:23:31,380
to enrich other people,
and to enrich also communities

477
00:23:31,381 --> 00:23:34,567
in the value of what we do in space.

478
00:23:41,338 --> 00:23:43,004
Where would I like to go in space

479
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:45,711
if the technology existed
and was available?

480
00:23:45,712 --> 00:23:47,460
I would go to an exoplanet.

481
00:23:49,569 --> 00:23:53,125
The solar system is an absolutely amazing

482
00:23:53,126 --> 00:23:54,664
and extremely rich environment.

483
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:57,874
We have discovered,
using probes and robots,

484
00:23:57,875 --> 00:24:01,847
that there is a huge diversity
in bodies in the solar system.

485
00:24:01,848 --> 00:24:05,918
When I consider just
the satellites of Saturn, Saturn has--

486
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,482
of course, it's a big planet,
it has rings--

487
00:24:08,483 --> 00:24:11,912
that it has about 65 satellites,

488
00:24:11,918 --> 00:24:16,232
and Cassini has obtained
a lot of detailed pictures

489
00:24:16,233 --> 00:24:19,583
of some of these satellites,
and there's an enormous diversity.

490
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:23,418
There's Enceladus, covered with ice,

491
00:24:23,418 --> 00:24:25,678
and you have kind of ice geysers

492
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:27,651
when it's illuminated by the Sun,

493
00:24:27,652 --> 00:24:29,742
on the side that is illuminated
by the Sun,

494
00:24:29,743 --> 00:24:31,035
and this is really amazing.

495
00:24:31,155 --> 00:24:33,936
And you have others
that are big rocks with craters,

496
00:24:33,937 --> 00:24:35,794
and you have enormous diversity.

497
00:24:36,733 --> 00:24:38,532
The solar system is fascinating.

498
00:24:38,533 --> 00:24:40,694
We know it reasonably well.

499
00:24:40,709 --> 00:24:45,918
Of course, we have visited Comet
Churyumov-Gerasimenko last year,

500
00:24:45,923 --> 00:24:48,190
already 2014 and 2015.

501
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:50,017
We continue doing that with Rosetta.

502
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:52,809
And this also is an amazing environment,

503
00:24:52,810 --> 00:24:58,438
and great places to send
astronauts to, also, why not?

504
00:24:58,439 --> 00:25:00,846
Although on a comet
you have to be careful,

505
00:25:00,847 --> 00:25:03,423
because the escape velocity
is very small,

506
00:25:03,424 --> 00:25:05,403
and you need to be careful
when you walk,

507
00:25:05,404 --> 00:25:06,989
because if you walk too fast

508
00:25:06,990 --> 00:25:10,320
you may reach escape velocity
and never come back,

509
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:12,857
so you need to use a tether
like we do on space walks,

510
00:25:12,977 --> 00:25:15,273
so that you don't escape forever

511
00:25:15,274 --> 00:25:17,052
from the surface of the comet.

512
00:25:17,053 --> 00:25:18,999
So the solar system is fascinating,

513
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:23,569
but long term, I would like
to go to another planet,

514
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,152
around another star to the Sun.

515
00:25:26,153 --> 00:25:27,876
It's not going to happen, obviously,

516
00:25:27,996 --> 00:25:30,549
and maybe humanity
will never leave the solar system,

517
00:25:30,550 --> 00:25:32,882
I don't know, maybe
they will at some point.

518
00:25:32,883 --> 00:25:35,247
But my dream is to go to an exoplanet.

519
00:25:40,813 --> 00:25:43,003
Well, would I do anything differently

520
00:25:43,004 --> 00:25:47,331
if I could live my life again?
I think the answer is no.

521
00:25:48,310 --> 00:25:51,619
I've been so privileged
to be able to do what I did,

522
00:25:53,694 --> 00:25:55,634
and it's because of the path I chose,

523
00:25:55,635 --> 00:25:58,174
but mainly because
I was influenced by people

524
00:25:58,175 --> 00:26:00,348
who inspired me, and who helped me.

525
00:26:00,349 --> 00:26:03,619
I was fortunate, also, to be lucky.

526
00:26:05,569 --> 00:26:07,885
I worked, of course,
but I had a lot of luck.

527
00:26:08,316 --> 00:26:11,751
I don't think I would
direct my life differently

528
00:26:11,752 --> 00:26:13,450
if I had to redo it.

529
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:15,005
Of course it's an impossibility.

530
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:17,030
We know we can't
travel in time in the past

531
00:26:17,031 --> 00:26:18,854
and do things differently,

532
00:26:19,438 --> 00:26:23,059
but no, I think I would live the life

533
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,976
that I've been living through,
and I would make the same choices,

534
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:32,045
and I was extraordinarily privileged
to be able to do what I did.

535
00:26:37,407 --> 00:26:40,519
From which country will be
the first human on Mars, and when?

536
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,401
I have no idea from which country
he or she will be.

537
00:26:45,233 --> 00:26:47,817
Obviously, we have some countries
that we can think of,

538
00:26:47,937 --> 00:26:49,710
like the United States and Russia,

539
00:26:49,711 --> 00:26:54,573
and Europe, and China, and India,
Canada, Japan.

540
00:26:54,857 --> 00:27:00,778
But this first human on Mars
could be from Korea,

541
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:03,742
from Zimbabwe, or from
I don't know which country,

542
00:27:03,743 --> 00:27:05,983
but I have no idea.

543
00:27:08,642 --> 00:27:13,981
It's likely to be a citizen,
man or woman,

544
00:27:13,982 --> 00:27:16,796
from one of the countries
who are the partners

545
00:27:16,797 --> 00:27:19,381
of the International Space Station,
because, of course,

546
00:27:19,501 --> 00:27:22,528
they went through
a big step in this direction,

547
00:27:22,529 --> 00:27:27,633
plus China and India,
which are the rising space powers,

548
00:27:27,634 --> 00:27:30,067
with a lot of will and a lot of talent.

549
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:33,924
So I would say the ISS partners,
plus China and India

550
00:27:33,925 --> 00:27:37,884
are the most likely ones,
but in fact for sure I don't know.

551
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:41,973
I think it will happen
this century, for sure,

552
00:27:41,974 --> 00:27:46,495
and I think in all likelihood,
before the middle of this century.

553
00:27:46,496 --> 00:27:49,221
Before 2050 we'll have people
walking on Mars.

554
00:27:56,676 --> 00:27:59,212
What did I think about
the days before going to space,

555
00:27:59,332 --> 00:28:01,054
and the seconds before liftoff?

556
00:28:01,391 --> 00:28:05,050
The days before, I was very excited.

557
00:28:05,302 --> 00:28:07,016
I was always very excited.

558
00:28:07,017 --> 00:28:09,206
I was looking forward
to the big adventure.

559
00:28:09,207 --> 00:28:11,336
Again, there was no concern and fear.

560
00:28:11,337 --> 00:28:13,156
The only concern that I had, somewhat,

561
00:28:13,276 --> 00:28:16,123
was during the powered ascent to space,

562
00:28:16,124 --> 00:28:19,551
about 8-1/2 minutes from liftoff
until main engine cutoff,

563
00:28:20,641 --> 00:28:22,888
but during the days before

564
00:28:22,889 --> 00:28:25,977
I was really, really,
really looking forward.

565
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,998
The reason why
the feeling was all positive

566
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:32,922
was that the training
was always very good,

567
00:28:32,923 --> 00:28:36,790
and I think this is
what gives you confidence

568
00:28:36,791 --> 00:28:39,327
that you can do something
if you have enough training.

569
00:28:39,447 --> 00:28:42,470
There was a solid training
behind us, the whole crew,

570
00:28:42,471 --> 00:28:46,541
and we were confident that
we could do the mission successfully,

571
00:28:46,542 --> 00:28:49,028
even if we had a number of problems,

572
00:28:49,029 --> 00:28:51,735
because we are trained to solve problems

573
00:28:51,736 --> 00:28:54,157
and accomplish the mission goals,

574
00:28:54,158 --> 00:28:58,052
even though we were going
to possibly meet with adversity.

575
00:28:59,223 --> 00:29:02,730
That's the feeling a few days before,
even the night before--

576
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:05,749
excited, looking forward to the adventure.

577
00:29:05,841 --> 00:29:08,395
The seconds before liftoff,
I must say, for me,

578
00:29:08,396 --> 00:29:11,605
I was always thinking of,
"What do you do, Claude,

579
00:29:11,606 --> 00:29:13,119
in case things go bad?"

580
00:29:14,051 --> 00:29:15,878
It's the same thing in aviation.

581
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:19,051
Before you put the throttle forward,

582
00:29:20,086 --> 00:29:24,786
especially in an airplane
like a jet airplane, and even more so

583
00:29:24,787 --> 00:29:28,129
in a multi-jet airplane
with two or four engines,

584
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:33,253
you put the throttle forward
to take off, and you need to think

585
00:29:33,254 --> 00:29:35,312
about what you do
in case you have problems,

586
00:29:35,432 --> 00:29:39,558
and this attitude
of a professional aviator,

587
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:44,246
which was mine, in aviation,
I had it also before liftoff,

588
00:29:44,247 --> 00:29:48,307
because there were some abort scenarios

589
00:29:48,308 --> 00:29:50,722
where we had to evacuate,
as rapidly as possible,

590
00:29:50,723 --> 00:29:53,154
the Space Shuttle, and you need
to do it in a certain order,

591
00:29:53,155 --> 00:29:54,689
you need to do certain tasks.

592
00:29:54,690 --> 00:29:57,651
Each of us had a certain number
of tasks to perform

593
00:29:57,652 --> 00:30:01,769
in order to do a rapid
and orderly evacuation

594
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,670
of the spacecraft in case of a problem.

595
00:30:03,671 --> 00:30:06,255
In the seconds before liftoff,
I was thinking, "Claude,

596
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:08,692
what do you do in case
you have a launch abort?"

597
00:30:09,167 --> 00:30:11,589
That's probably my education in aviation.

598
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:13,960
That's the same thought that you have

599
00:30:13,961 --> 00:30:17,587
before putting the throttle forward
for takeoff from the runway.
