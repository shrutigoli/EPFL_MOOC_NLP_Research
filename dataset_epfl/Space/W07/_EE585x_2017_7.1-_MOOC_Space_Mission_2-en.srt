00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:03,598
Hello everyone, and welcome
to unit 7 of the course.

2
00:00:04,166 --> 00:00:06,978
We will cover selected topics
on human space flight.

3
00:00:07,178 --> 00:00:09,978
As well as the future of
space exploration.

4
00:00:10,973 --> 00:00:15,660
The subject will be 7.2, 
extra vehicular or space walk.

5
00:00:16,349 --> 00:00:19,386
7.3, space robotics
for the space shuttle

6
00:00:19,586 --> 00:00:21,374
and the international space station.

7
00:00:22,178 --> 00:00:26,640
7.4 will be about astronaut training,
including training for spacewalks

8
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,265
in a water environment to simulate
a world without gravity.

9
00:00:31,533 --> 00:00:34,145
7.5 will be about
sub orbital flights

10
00:00:34,345 --> 00:00:37,808
basically going up and down,
reaching a maximum altitude

11
00:00:38,008 --> 00:00:39,933
of at least 100 kilometers.

12
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,845
The upper part of the trajectory
being at free fall

13
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:45,558
and consequently in  (INAUDIBLE)
conditions.

14
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:51,004
7.6 will cover the future of space
utilization and exploration,

15
00:00:51,279 --> 00:00:52,804
manned and unmanned.

16
00:00:53,482 --> 00:00:57,482
We have prepared some practice 
quizzes after each video as usual

17
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,945
to make sure that you have
understood the relevant concepts.

18
00:01:02,432 --> 00:01:05,082
Each section from 7.2 to 7.6

19
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:07,732
is concluded again 
by a controlled quiz.

20
00:01:08,584 --> 00:01:11,509
In addition, there's a test
at the end of the unit.

21
00:01:12,959 --> 00:01:16,346
To illustrate the unit, we have
prepared a focus on commercial

22
00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:20,759
suborbital space flight, with 
an interview of Harry van Hulten 

23
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,500
experimental test pilot for 
the XCOR Aerospace Company.

24
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,635
He has a responsibility 
of conducting test flights

25
00:01:28,835 --> 00:01:33,160
of the Lynx space plane prior to its
operation and commercial utilization.

26
00:01:34,593 --> 00:01:37,518
Well this is it. Enjoy this last
unit of the course.

27
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,905
This is a real astronaut's unit.
Take care.
