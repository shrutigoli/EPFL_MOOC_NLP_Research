1
00:00:08,214 --> 00:00:11,085
So, my name is Thomas Schildknecht.

2
00:00:11,085 --> 00:00:15,503
I'm working with the Astronomical
Institute of the University of Bern.

3
00:00:16,972 --> 00:00:20,483
I'm also the director
of the Swiss Optical Ground Station

4
00:00:21,132 --> 00:00:25,086
and Geodynamics Observatory
in Zimmerwald near Bern.

5
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:42,911
These two pictures, in fact,
I would say are realistic on one hand.

6
00:00:43,521 --> 00:00:47,342
In terms of number of objects,
they're absolutely realistic.

7
00:00:47,342 --> 00:00:52,171
So, we are talking nowadays
about roughly 20,000 objects

8
00:00:52,841 --> 00:00:57,125
larger than 10 centimeters
orbiting the Earth,

9
00:00:57,125 --> 00:01:00,300
and this is only the population
of objects we know.

10
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,406
On the other hand, they are not
totally realistic because

11
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:08,870
the size of the objects in these pictures
is much, very much, exaggerated

12
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:12,176
to the real size of the objects in space.

13
00:01:31,287 --> 00:01:35,467
We are doing what we call
space debris research

14
00:01:35,467 --> 00:01:39,657
which really means we are trying
to find out more

15
00:01:39,657 --> 00:01:42,658
about the space debris environment.

16
00:01:42,658 --> 00:01:46,266
So, we do different
kind of studies

17
00:01:46,266 --> 00:01:48,776
to answer a series of questions.

18
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:52,877
The first most important questions being

19
00:01:53,417 --> 00:01:56,025
how many space debris are there?

20
00:01:56,025 --> 00:01:58,142
What are their sizes?

21
00:01:58,142 --> 00:02:00,643
What are their orbital regimes?

22
00:02:02,845 --> 00:02:05,277
Do we see new sources?

23
00:02:05,857 --> 00:02:07,188
Do we have sinks?

24
00:02:07,713 --> 00:02:12,094
How is this environment 
going to evolve over the years?

25
00:02:12,684 --> 00:02:14,064
One set of questions.

26
00:02:14,064 --> 00:02:17,931
The other questions are then,
what is the nature of these objects?

27
00:02:17,931 --> 00:02:20,325
For some of the objects it's simple.

28
00:02:20,515 --> 00:02:25,476
Space debris by definition
are man-made objects in space

29
00:02:25,476 --> 00:02:29,418
which are not
of any useful purpose anymore.

30
00:02:29,418 --> 00:02:34,795
So, a spent upper stage
is a space debris in most cases

31
00:02:34,795 --> 00:02:37,727
unless you intend to use that upper stage

32
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:40,641
as a source of raw material, for example,

33
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:43,561
but let's assume that
this is a space debris.

34
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:47,156
This is an easy case,
but there's a lot of small pieces,

35
00:02:47,156 --> 00:02:51,932
fragments up there where we
don't know exactly what they are.

36
00:02:51,932 --> 00:02:56,926
So, are these pieces
of let's say solar cells, for example?

37
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,402
Multi-layer insulation materials?

38
00:03:00,182 --> 00:03:04,044
These are the questions.
We try with these studies,

39
00:03:04,044 --> 00:03:07,854
we try to answer because
it's very important to know what they are

40
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:12,124
because if they are, for example,
multi-layer insulation material,

41
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:16,964
then you can go on
and devise methods

42
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:20,917
to mitigate the production
of these debris in space.

43
00:03:20,917 --> 00:03:23,547
But, it's important that you
know what they are

44
00:03:23,547 --> 00:03:25,331
and what the sources are.

45
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:30,589
So, we did a lot of studies
in terms of surveillance,

46
00:03:30,589 --> 00:03:33,989
so we have been looking
at the sky in principle

47
00:03:34,589 --> 00:03:37,567
to find these pieces
over many, many years

48
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:42,721
and to find especially small size pieces
which are not, let's say,

49
00:03:43,831 --> 00:03:47,482
among these 20,000s
I have been mentioning or not,

50
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:51,166
were not known before
we have been looking for them.

51
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:55,254
And then, we went off
to characterize them.

52
00:03:55,254 --> 00:04:00,114
We have been finding
a very special class of debris pieces

53
00:04:00,977 --> 00:04:04,724
which are of what we call
high area-to-mass

54
00:04:04,724 --> 00:04:08,686
which have a large area
and a small mass,

55
00:04:08,686 --> 00:04:11,790
which are really very special
like a lightweight,

56
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:14,517
like a piece of paper, for example.

57
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:17,809
So, these are the kind
of studies we have been doing.

58
00:04:17,809 --> 00:04:21,958
We also maintain a catalog of objects

59
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:25,939
in order to help space agencies, perhaps,

60
00:04:26,103 --> 00:04:30,128
to avoid a collision
with an active spacecraft.

61
00:04:35,486 --> 00:04:38,173
The outcome of these studies is

62
00:04:38,173 --> 00:04:43,523
that there is in all regions
we have been looking at,

63
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:49,054
there is a population
of small-size debris

64
00:04:49,652 --> 00:04:52,101
which has not been known before.

65
00:04:52,741 --> 00:04:56,992
So, the modelers which come up with models
for the space debris environment,

66
00:04:56,992 --> 00:05:01,193
a number of pieces
in certain regions, size range.

67
00:05:01,693 --> 00:05:04,775
These models have been
taking into account our results,

68
00:05:05,285 --> 00:05:08,925
especially in what we call
the geostationary ring.

69
00:05:08,925 --> 00:05:12,598
We have been finding,
even in the late '90s,

70
00:05:13,678 --> 00:05:17,616
we got first evidence that there is
small-size debris up there.

71
00:05:18,239 --> 00:05:23,075
By small-size in this region,
I mean 10 centimeters, 20 centimeters,

72
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:27,956
And of course, the question comes up,
what is the source of these debris?

73
00:05:28,649 --> 00:05:30,114
Is it collisions?

74
00:05:30,114 --> 00:05:33,074
Is it explosive events?

75
00:05:33,074 --> 00:05:36,930
We had some explosive events
in this particular region.

76
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,117
Or is it aging?
Aging of satellites.

77
00:05:41,117 --> 00:05:46,179
You know satellites have some
outer surface material

78
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:51,347
like multi-layer insulation material
or solar cells,

79
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:57,480
and when they are aging,
this material may become brittle

80
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,727
or the glue may become brittle

81
00:05:59,727 --> 00:06:02,967
and it may just be off the surfaces.

82
00:06:03,657 --> 00:06:07,004
So, in this particular region,
we have been finding

83
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:12,800
what I was alluding to,
these high area-to-mass ratio debris.

84
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,516
And some of them are really
high area-to-mass,

85
00:06:15,516 --> 00:06:18,861
which means many, many
square meters per kilogram,

86
00:06:19,617 --> 00:06:23,986
so it's much more lightweight
than a piece of ordinary office paper.

87
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:27,496
So, it's probably,
we don't know yet for sure,

88
00:06:27,496 --> 00:06:32,769
but it could be material
like these insulation blankets

89
00:06:32,769 --> 00:06:37,651
used to keep satellite warm.

90
00:06:40,627 --> 00:06:43,497
Or it could also be
that they are solar cells.

91
00:06:53,272 --> 00:06:56,914
So, we are using, in particular,
optical instruments,

92
00:06:57,424 --> 00:07:00,562
mostly what we call
passive optical instruments.

93
00:07:00,562 --> 00:07:05,871
So, it is a kind of classical telescopes
used in astronomy.

94
00:07:07,048 --> 00:07:10,800
We use them in the optical range,
visible to near-infrared.

95
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,684
And the techniques we are using
are very, very similar

96
00:07:16,103 --> 00:07:20,311
to what we used to do,
and still do,

97
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:24,564
when searching
for asteroids, comets,

98
00:07:24,564 --> 00:07:28,684
or other moving
natural objects in space.

99
00:07:29,954 --> 00:07:32,861
So, this is, by the way,
also the heritage,

100
00:07:32,861 --> 00:07:36,546
why we came to this research.

101
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:39,466
So, it's traditional optical telescopes.

102
00:07:39,466 --> 00:07:43,797
The difference is
especially in the fact

103
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:49,422
that we take a lot,
really a lot of images.

104
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:54,249
We take about one image
every few seconds,

105
00:07:55,309 --> 00:07:58,824
so it means we get thousands
of images every night

106
00:07:58,824 --> 00:08:02,136
from each of the telescopes
we are using,

107
00:08:02,136 --> 00:08:04,694
and this is very specific.

108
00:08:04,694 --> 00:08:06,907
The treatment of these thousands of images

109
00:08:06,907 --> 00:08:12,568
to find the needle in the haystack,
the small-size objects

110
00:08:12,568 --> 00:08:16,527
in front of the myriads
of background stars,

111
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:18,544
this is really the secret.

112
00:08:18,544 --> 00:08:22,278
So, it's about software,
image processing softwares

113
00:08:22,278 --> 00:08:24,127
to find these pieces.

114
00:08:24,687 --> 00:08:30,418
And afterwards,
we need to try to come up

115
00:08:30,418 --> 00:08:33,395
with orbits for these objects
or estimate orbits,

116
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:35,912
or its celestial mechanics,
or astrodynamics.

117
00:08:37,629 --> 00:08:41,584
This is one type of sensors
we are using,

118
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:45,384
and the other one,
which is a recent development.

119
00:08:45,384 --> 00:08:49,491
We are also using
active optical sensors,

120
00:08:49,491 --> 00:08:54,735
so laser ranging sensors
where we emit the laser pulse

121
00:08:55,285 --> 00:09:00,504
and receive a few photons
which are scattered or reflected

122
00:09:00,504 --> 00:09:02,929
by the object of interest.

123
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:06,213
And then, we measure
the time of flight in principle,

124
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:08,231
or the range as we call it.

125
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:12,563
This technique can be used
to improve orbits of space debris,

126
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:16,086
but also we can use
the same technique

127
00:09:16,086 --> 00:09:19,489
to estimate attitude motion
of the objects.

128
00:09:20,865 --> 00:09:24,918
By the way, we are also
estimating attitude motion

129
00:09:24,918 --> 00:09:28,413
by the optical techniques,
the passive techniques

130
00:09:28,413 --> 00:09:33,208
by what we call,
by using light curves.

131
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:38,623
So, this is the change
of the intensity of the object with time

132
00:09:38,623 --> 00:09:42,830
which reflects somehow its motion,
its attitude motion in space.

133
00:09:43,841 --> 00:09:46,255
We are using spectroscopy

134
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:50,655
to infer the surface material
of the objects.

135
00:09:50,655 --> 00:09:55,573
For example, to distinguish
solar cells from perhaps

136
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:58,220
something like bare aluminum.

137
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:02,889
So, we are using, in principle,
we are using a whole serie

138
00:10:02,889 --> 00:10:05,288
of classical astronomical techniques,

139
00:10:05,288 --> 00:10:10,508
but with a special challenge
that these objects are fast-moving

140
00:10:10,508 --> 00:10:13,752
in front of the background stars.

141
00:10:13,752 --> 00:10:16,626
And that we are taking
much more images

142
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,475
than traditionally astronomers do.

143
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:30,431
There are, of course, other institutions
worldwide working on the topic,

144
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,445
and especially also doing
some observations.

145
00:10:34,517 --> 00:10:38,868
We have collaborations
with many colleagues

146
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:42,567
which have some,
or do some studies

147
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:44,784
for their own space agencies.

148
00:10:44,784 --> 00:10:48,052
For example, we have close collaboration
with Russian colleagues

149
00:10:48,962 --> 00:10:52,644
from the Keldysh Institute
of Applied Mathematics in Moscow.

150
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:57,404
They are maintaining
a catalog of space debris

151
00:10:57,404 --> 00:11:01,781
in high-altitude orbits,
so in orbits like the geostationary orbit,

152
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:04,860
or in medium Earth orbits

153
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:09,809
like the orbits
of the navigation satellites,

154
00:11:09,809 --> 00:11:12,675
GPS, GLONASS,
BeiDou and so on.

155
00:11:14,545 --> 00:11:18,773
We have collaboration
with NASA colleagues,

156
00:11:19,939 --> 00:11:21,919
with JAXA colleagues from Japan.

157
00:11:22,559 --> 00:11:27,618
So, this work is only meaningful

158
00:11:27,618 --> 00:11:30,260
if it's done in an international
collaboration.

159
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,932
Let's give you an example.

160
00:11:31,932 --> 00:11:36,452
If you have one object discovered here,
over Switzerland, let's say.

161
00:11:37,414 --> 00:11:40,919
So, this object is going to move,
perhaps, around the world.

162
00:11:40,919 --> 00:11:46,014
If it is in GEO, it may move out
of your visibility zone for several weeks.

163
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:50,092
If you don't follow it up,
then you will lose it,

164
00:11:50,092 --> 00:11:53,954
so you need some colleagues
doing the same,

165
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:57,794
or doing a follow-up observations
on the other side of the Earth.

166
00:11:57,794 --> 00:12:02,598
So, international collaboration
is key in this domain.

167
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:11,207
It's a good question
if the space debris problem

168
00:12:11,207 --> 00:12:14,000
is taken seriously by space agencies.

169
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,165
I would say space agencies
were among the first

170
00:12:18,165 --> 00:12:20,832
who took the problem seriously.

171
00:12:20,832 --> 00:12:26,163
I remember, it was the late '80s
when the first space agencies,

172
00:12:27,085 --> 00:12:30,162
including NASA, ESA, JAXA

173
00:12:30,162 --> 00:12:33,162
and then the Russian Space Agency

174
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:36,467
were becoming really aware
of the problem.

175
00:12:36,467 --> 00:12:38,952
And during the '90s,
they established

176
00:12:40,262 --> 00:12:44,602
an Inter-agency Space Debris
Coordination Committee.

177
00:12:44,602 --> 00:12:46,302
It's a technical body.

178
00:12:46,302 --> 00:12:48,763
We call it also IADC

179
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:53,673
which is working
on solving technical questions,

180
00:12:53,673 --> 00:12:56,537
but also they have
four working groups.

181
00:12:56,537 --> 00:12:59,509
One is measurement,
another one is modelling

182
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:01,355
of the space debris environment.

183
00:13:01,355 --> 00:13:03,436
The third one is shielding.

184
00:13:03,436 --> 00:13:06,703
What can we do in terms
of protecting our spacecraft?

185
00:13:06,703 --> 00:13:09,015
And the fourth one is mitigation.

186
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:11,648
What can we do in terms
of protecting the environment?

187
00:13:12,268 --> 00:13:17,524
So, I think the topic
is taken seriously by space agencies,

188
00:13:17,524 --> 00:13:20,039
but you also have to be aware:

189
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:28,018
Government space agencies
are only one of the actors in space.

190
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:31,165
We have commercial space activities,

191
00:13:31,765 --> 00:13:35,815
especially Earth observation satellites
which are owned

192
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:37,716
by commercial companies.

193
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:40,342
We have commercial
communications satellites

194
00:13:40,342 --> 00:13:43,548
on GEO, TV satellites and so on.

195
00:13:44,338 --> 00:13:48,184
And we have a third player 
in this game

196
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:52,283
which is governmental player again,
but it's the military sector.

197
00:13:52,283 --> 00:13:56,439
So, the problem has to be taken seriously,

198
00:13:57,179 --> 00:14:02,441
not just by space agencies,
but by all sectors, all players,

199
00:14:04,751 --> 00:14:06,723
and actors in space.

200
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:11,620
So, on one hand, I would say
yes, it's taken seriously,

201
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,324
but on the other hand,
I would also say

202
00:14:15,084 --> 00:14:18,252
we need more effort right now

203
00:14:18,252 --> 00:14:22,066
to make sure
that this situation

204
00:14:22,066 --> 00:14:25,206
is not getting out
of control pretty soon.

205
00:14:30,866 --> 00:14:34,193
So, there's a lot of scenarios

206
00:14:35,783 --> 00:14:38,389
for the evolution
of the space debris environment.

207
00:14:38,389 --> 00:14:42,170
And the problem
is a bit similar to the scenarios

208
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:47,899
when talking about global warming,
for example.

209
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:53,407
So, these scenarios all include
a set of parameters, assumptions

210
00:14:55,302 --> 00:14:58,297
which you could debate 
if they are correct or not,

211
00:14:58,297 --> 00:15:04,541
but all of these scenarios
show that the space debris environment,

212
00:15:04,541 --> 00:15:08,657
in certain regions, for example,
in the low Earth region

213
00:15:09,737 --> 00:15:13,930
at an altitude of between
700 and 1,000 kilometers,

214
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:21,521
is going to increase dramatically
over the decades to come

215
00:15:22,361 --> 00:15:25,822
if we do what we call
business as usual.

216
00:15:25,822 --> 00:15:28,317
So, the same launch rates

217
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:34,588
and the same mitigation, let's say,
measures we apply right now.

218
00:15:34,588 --> 00:15:38,841
We apply some, but they
are not strict enough

219
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:45,955
to prevent even an exponential growth
of that environment

220
00:15:45,955 --> 00:15:49,628
in terms of number of objects
because we'll have collisions

221
00:15:49,628 --> 00:15:52,937
among objects which
are not controlled.

222
00:15:53,767 --> 00:15:56,017
And this means with each collision,

223
00:15:56,017 --> 00:16:01,407
we are producing a huge number
of new fragments

224
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:05,836
and all these new objects
may have a certain possibility

225
00:16:05,836 --> 00:16:08,714
and increased possibility
that there is collisions

226
00:16:08,714 --> 00:16:12,775
among uncontrolled objects.

227
00:16:14,565 --> 00:16:19,257
In certain regions, we think
all these models show

228
00:16:19,257 --> 00:16:23,362
that we have to expect, 
or are already in the phase

229
00:16:23,362 --> 00:16:26,707
where we have an exponential
runaway of the number of objects.

230
00:16:27,447 --> 00:16:32,732
So, that's the bad news.

231
00:16:32,732 --> 00:16:37,625
There is also good news
in the sense that we do,

232
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:42,125
in these models, we can also
modify the environment

233
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:45,526
and for example,
talk about removing

234
00:16:45,526 --> 00:16:48,426
some of the mass which is in space,

235
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:52,072
some of the big objects,
and try to see how many of these objects

236
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:55,782
we have to remove
in order to stabilize the environment,

237
00:16:55,782 --> 00:17:01,285
or in order to reach
an acceptable collision risk

238
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:05,245
for active spacecraft,
or human spaceflight even.

239
00:17:05,245 --> 00:17:10,352
So, there is certainly a lot
which can be done,

240
00:17:10,352 --> 00:17:14,479
but one thing we have
to be aware is that

241
00:17:16,419 --> 00:17:18,629
what we call remediation,

242
00:17:18,629 --> 00:17:22,511
so removing something,
or doing something

243
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:24,331
to the current environment.

244
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:29,100
This is much more costly
and much more challenging also

245
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,173
from the technical point of view

246
00:17:32,173 --> 00:17:35,763
than mitigation which means

247
00:17:36,383 --> 00:17:40,786
preventing the future or preventing
the production of space debris.

248
00:17:40,786 --> 00:17:44,521
There's a lot of simple measures

249
00:17:44,521 --> 00:17:47,441
to prevent the production
of space debris.

250
00:17:47,441 --> 00:17:51,038
The best measure actually
is not to leave anything up there.

251
00:17:51,038 --> 00:17:55,796
So, if at the end of the mission
of, let's say, a spacecraft

252
00:17:55,796 --> 00:17:59,507
or an upper stage, if you remove
that spacecraft or the upper stage

253
00:17:59,507 --> 00:18:03,112
from the orbit,
that's the best way to prevent

254
00:18:03,112 --> 00:18:05,405
for the production of space debris.

255
00:18:05,405 --> 00:18:10,269
Or you remove residual fuel
at the end of a mission.

256
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:13,268
You empty your batteries.

257
00:18:14,658 --> 00:18:18,300
Make sure that there is no source
of energy which could produce

258
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:22,872
an explosive breakup event
of a spacecraft.

259
00:18:23,402 --> 00:18:28,577
Just to name a few of the simple,
of the measures which

260
00:18:29,842 --> 00:18:33,561
could prevent the future production
of space debris.

261
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:44,605
Why did I decide to become a scientist?

262
00:18:44,605 --> 00:18:49,458
So, this question is perhaps
a more general one, I have to say.

263
00:18:51,448 --> 00:18:55,174
I'm of the generation
who witnessed the Apollo Program.

264
00:18:56,019 --> 00:18:59,095
I was absolutely enthusiastic about space,

265
00:19:01,115 --> 00:19:04,508
about space in general
and the space programs in the '60s.

266
00:19:05,238 --> 00:19:07,587
And of course, I wanted
to become an astronaut,

267
00:19:07,587 --> 00:19:09,636
as many of my generation.

268
00:19:09,636 --> 00:19:14,227
I wanted to build space planes,
rockets, and so on,

269
00:19:14,227 --> 00:19:18,512
but gradually, I was then also
very much attracted by astronomy.

270
00:19:19,142 --> 00:19:23,429
So, I wanted to know why
the universe is as it is,

271
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:29,675
or why we are seeing
these stars up there.

272
00:19:29,675 --> 00:19:32,065
What are these stars and so on?

273
00:19:32,725 --> 00:19:36,679
And I went on and studied physics
and astronomy.

274
00:19:37,329 --> 00:19:41,228
I was then working primarily in,

275
00:19:42,348 --> 00:19:46,936
let's say, the near environment
in the solar system.

276
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:52,742
I was engaged in a program
to find exploding stars,

277
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:55,302
what we call supernovae.

278
00:19:55,302 --> 00:19:59,332
And afterwards, we also discovered
a lot of minor planets,

279
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:03,163
as they were called at that time,
asteroids, near-Earth objects,

280
00:20:03,873 --> 00:20:08,282
and so that's where
I developed the techniques

281
00:20:08,282 --> 00:20:13,652
to find moving objects,
to compute their orbits,

282
00:20:14,142 --> 00:20:17,908
and predict their orbits and future.

283
00:20:19,888 --> 00:20:25,046
During the, let's say, '80s,
beginning of the '90s,

284
00:20:25,646 --> 00:20:29,905
we also found a lot of these
artificial objects in our images,

285
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:36,248
and this brought me
to the whole question of space debris,

286
00:20:37,238 --> 00:20:42,538
and this was another fascinating
subject where I could apply

287
00:20:42,538 --> 00:20:47,584
the techniques which were classical
on one hand, but on the other hand

288
00:20:47,584 --> 00:20:50,402
we had also to devise new methods.

289
00:20:51,462 --> 00:20:56,057
And finally, I decided for myself

290
00:20:56,057 --> 00:20:58,967
that this problem is really becoming,

291
00:20:58,967 --> 00:21:03,126
or would become,
very important for

292
00:21:04,036 --> 00:21:07,992
any kind of space missions,
especially also manned missions.

293
00:21:08,792 --> 00:21:14,243
And I would like to contribute
to the solution of the problem.

294
00:21:14,243 --> 00:21:17,347
I'm still convinced
that there is a solution.

295
00:21:17,347 --> 00:21:19,722
We just have to try and to work.
