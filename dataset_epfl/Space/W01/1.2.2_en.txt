The law of gravitation, another fundamental law of Newton, expresses the force between two bodies of mass <i>m</i> and mass <i>M</i>, separated by a distance of <i>r</i>.
This force is equal to the gravitational constant <i>G</i>, multiplied by the product of the masses and divided by the square of the distance between these two masses.
What we'll be doing in the course very often will be to express these forces, and sometimes it will be also the energy, per unit mass.
So <i>F</i> divided by <i>m</i> is equal to <i>Î¼</i> over <i>r</i> squared.
The <i>Î¼</i> is equal to the gravitational constant times the mass of the central body,
<i>G</i> times <i>M</i> is going to be <i>Î¼</i>, and we'll be using this symbology for most of the course.
Now, the gravitational constant is given at the bottom of the slide, and at the end of this section you can download a series of constants and values that will be used in the course.
Now let's look at the laws of mechanics for rotations.
So far we've done it for translations.
<i>F</i> equaled <i>dp</i> over <i>dt</i>, the time derivative of the momentum.
Now if we have the case of a rotation around a center of rotation, expressed by the little cross in this drawing here, we can just replace the force in the second law of Newton by the torque.
The torque being the cross product of the radius vector by the force.
Now the cross product, we have to understand how it works in terms of directions.
You can take the right hand, and the first vector is going to be the thumb, <i>r</i>, the second vector is going to be the force, and the torque is going to be perpendicular to the first two.
The direction of the torque is going to be in the direction of the third finger, as I'm showing here with my right hand.
Be sure to use the right hand, not the left hand.
With the left hand, you are going to get the wrong result in terms of direction.
Now, the second law of Newton for rotations, again, you replace the force by the torque, and you replace the momentum <i>p</i> vectorial, by the angular momentum, which is the cross product of <i>r</i> and <i>p</i>.
And again, you use the same right-hand rule in order to determine which will be the change in the direction of <i>L</i>, typically the change in direction of the rotation rate <i>Ï‰</i>, whenever you exercise a certain torque on a rotating body.
Now, the angular momentum, <i>L</i>, with a vector, for a solid body, when we have a fixed rotation axis, which I express here as a small <i>Î”</i>, the angular momentum is going to be the product of the moment of inertia <i>I_Î”</i>, which will be defined in a second, and Ï‰, the rotation rate, a vector in radians per second.
The moment of inertia itself, if we have a body consisting of a series of small individual bodies, each of them with a distance <i>r_i</i> to the axis of rotation, and each of them being of a mass <i>m_i</i>, you just do the sum of the product of the masses times the square of the distance of these individual masses to the axis of rotation.
And of course, if you have a continuous body, you do the integral over the volume of <i>r</i> squared <i>dm</i>, which is the element of mass, which is equivalent to the density at that location, multiplied by the element of volume.
Now let's take the example of the precession of a spinning top.
Here you have a spinning top with an axis of rotation which has somewhat deviated from the local vertical.
And you have the radius vector from the point of contact with the soil, all the way to the center of mass, and you have the gravitational force <i>mg</i> exercising this effect on the center of mass of the spinning top.
Now, if you do the <i>r</i> cross <i>F</i>, the torque, in order to determine which direction the <i>Ï‰</i> will be moving, you have
<i>r</i> upwards, somewhat to the left, and you have <i>F</i> downwards, so it will give you torque outside of your computer screen, towards you, so it will give you this direction that you see on top of the spinning top, in terms of the precession.
So if you look from upwards on the spinning top, it's going to be precessing counterclockwise.
