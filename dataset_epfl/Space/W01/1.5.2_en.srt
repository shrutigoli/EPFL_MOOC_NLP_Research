1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:09,362
Let's talk about the radiation
on Earth and the Solar System in general.

2
00:00:09,362 --> 00:00:13,704
Obviously, this radiational field
is totally dominated by the Sun itself

3
00:00:13,704 --> 00:00:18,231
but let's have, first of all, a look
at the electromagnetic spectrum.

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:21,910
The Sun is radiating
over a very large fraction

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:24,419
of this total electromagnetic spectrum.

6
00:00:24,677 --> 00:00:31,079
If we look here in the middle we have
increasing wavelength

7
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,850
from the left to the right,

8
00:00:33,850 --> 00:00:36,845
starting with the Gamma rays,
the X-rays, the UV

9
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:39,061
and then we have a very narrow band

10
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:43,504
between about 500 nanometers
to about 700 nanometers

11
00:00:43,504 --> 00:00:45,465
where we have the visible,

12
00:00:45,465 --> 00:00:48,137
and the visible
is the part of the spectrum

13
00:00:48,137 --> 00:00:50,582
to which our eyes are sensitive.

14
00:00:50,582 --> 00:00:54,392
There's nearly a total transparency
of the atmosphere

15
00:00:54,392 --> 00:00:56,180
in the visible part of the spectrum.

16
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,663
Then we go to the infrared.

17
00:00:57,663 --> 00:01:00,422
We'll look later at the absorption
in the infrared

18
00:01:00,422 --> 00:01:03,000
due to molecules in the atmosphere.

19
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,037
Then we have the radio waves
beyond about one centimeter,

20
00:01:07,037 --> 00:01:10,319
a wavelength for which the atmosphere
is, again, transparent.

21
00:01:12,019 --> 00:01:14,823
This is the solar irradiance spectrum.

22
00:01:14,823 --> 00:01:18,129
The irradiance is, in fact,

23
00:01:19,915 --> 00:01:24,680
the radiation power per unit surface

24
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:29,957
and per unit wavelength, if we talk
about the so-called spectral irradiance.

25
00:01:30,243 --> 00:01:34,680
The total irradiance of the Sun
is the total energy

26
00:01:36,043 --> 00:01:38,227
that it sends every unit of time

27
00:01:38,227 --> 00:01:43,547
or every second on a square meter surface

28
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:45,637
outside of the Earth's atmosphere

29
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:47,831
but if you talk
about the spectral irradiance,

30
00:01:47,831 --> 00:01:50,359
it's the distribution
of these areas of the Sun

31
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,968
over the spectrum.

32
00:01:52,253 --> 00:01:54,270
If we look at the spectrum of the Sun,

33
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:59,458
which is in yellow in this figure,
we see that we start

34
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:05,252
at about 250 nanometers
in the ultraviolet.

35
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:12,488
Then it peaks at about 0.5 micron,
or 500 nanometers.

36
00:02:12,488 --> 00:02:17,119
Then it starts to decrease
slowly towards the infrared

37
00:02:17,119 --> 00:02:19,877
and the millimeter waves and radio waves.

38
00:02:20,761 --> 00:02:27,901
This spectrum of the Sun, or distribution
of radiation intensity of the Sun

39
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:34,721
mimics more or less
5250ยบ Centigrade black body spectrum.

40
00:02:35,747 --> 00:02:41,027
In red, you have the radiation spectrum
of the Sun at sea level.

41
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:44,670
On one hand, you have a reduction
due to the fact that you have the albedo.

42
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:48,659
Part of the radiation from the Sun
is reflected back in space,

43
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:51,143
mainly from the upper atmosphere,

44
00:02:51,143 --> 00:02:54,033
and you also have
a number of dark features

45
00:02:54,033 --> 00:02:57,063
or absorption lines,
mainly due to the water vapor

46
00:02:57,063 --> 00:03:00,598
and to the carbon dioxide
in the atmosphere.

47
00:03:01,176 --> 00:03:06,887
So again, on this figure you have, from UV
all the way to the millimeter wave,

48
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:10,169
you have the spectrum of the Sun
outside the Earth's atmosphere,

49
00:03:10,169 --> 00:03:13,389
the 5250ยบ Centigrade black body spectrum

50
00:03:13,389 --> 00:03:16,670
that mimics the spectrum of the Sun
outside of the Earth's atmosphere,

51
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,049
and you have the reduced radiation
on the Earth's surface

52
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:22,073
diminished by the albedo on one hand

53
00:03:22,073 --> 00:03:25,000
and by absorption by molecules,
mainly in the infrared.

54
00:03:26,965 --> 00:03:30,501
The solar constant
is the total solar irradiance

55
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:35,537
on one square meter of a surface
outside of the Earth's atmosphere,

56
00:03:35,887 --> 00:03:39,429
at the distance that the Sun
corresponding to one Astronomical Unit,

57
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:42,300
which is about 150 million kilometers,

58
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,337
which is the average distance
between the Sun and the Earth.

59
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:49,516
You see these here,

60
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:54,182
so about 1.4 kilowatts of radiation power

61
00:03:54,707 --> 00:03:57,662
on the Earth, now of course,
you are closer to the Sun,

62
00:03:57,662 --> 00:04:01,210
you have a higher value
of this solar irradiance

63
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,618
and when you go further away
in the Solar System

64
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,568
like Mars, Jupiter, Saturn,
Uranus, and Neptune,

65
00:04:06,568 --> 00:04:07,903
you have a lower value.

66
00:04:07,903 --> 00:04:10,662
It's important or interesting
to see that for Mars,

67
00:04:10,662 --> 00:04:16,462
you have about 580 watts per square meter

68
00:04:16,462 --> 00:04:19,778
so it's a little less
than the solar constant

69
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:21,055
that you have at the level of the Earth

70
00:04:21,055 --> 00:04:24,768
but it's still okay to use solar panels
on the surface of Mars

71
00:04:24,768 --> 00:04:27,991
or for a spacecraft in orbit
around the red planet.

72
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,952
The solar radiation
still gives you enough power

73
00:04:31,952 --> 00:04:38,960
in order to satisfy the needs
of electrical power of the onboard system,

74
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,831
either of a robot on the surface,

75
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,731
or a space shot orbiting the red planet.

76
00:04:44,644 --> 00:04:49,615
Now, there's a definite effect of mainly
the ultraviolet light from the Sun

77
00:04:49,615 --> 00:04:54,926
on the surface of the satellite
and on systems onboard the satellite.

78
00:04:57,989 --> 00:05:00,983
The main effect
on the surface of the satellite

79
00:05:00,983 --> 00:05:06,477
is a darkening over time
of the surface of the satellite.

80
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:12,316
Typically, if you have a white surface,
it will become gray and darker over time.

81
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:17,800
You have a value of <i>alpha</i>
which is solar absorptivity,

82
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,371
which is increasing with time

83
00:05:20,371 --> 00:05:23,555
due to the impact
of the UV light from the Sun.

84
00:05:24,273 --> 00:05:27,286
You also have a degradation
in the performance of the solar array

85
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,379
due to the UV radiation,

86
00:05:29,379 --> 00:05:32,347
and sometimes you can have a local effect
on the surface of a satellite

87
00:05:32,347 --> 00:05:34,499
causing electrical discharges

88
00:05:34,499 --> 00:05:36,661
because of the ionization

89
00:05:36,661 --> 00:05:38,936
caused by the UV radiation from the Sun.
