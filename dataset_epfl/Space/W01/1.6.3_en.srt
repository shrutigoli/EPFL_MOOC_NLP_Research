1
00:00:05,498 --> 00:00:07,274
In this lesson we'll talk about

2
00:00:07,274 --> 00:00:11,542
asteroid and comet nuclei
collision threat with the Earth.

3
00:00:11,542 --> 00:00:15,904
But before we do this, let's have
a look at the impact per year

4
00:00:15,904 --> 00:00:19,769
on a 1m² plate in low Earth orbit.

5
00:00:19,769 --> 00:00:20,988
This is an interesting graph,

6
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:25,715
that is showing on one hand
the meteoroids,

7
00:00:25,715 --> 00:00:28,886
or the natural object's curve,

8
00:00:28,886 --> 00:00:32,343
of the flux impact
per square meter and per year,

9
00:00:32,343 --> 00:00:34,306
as a function of the size.

10
00:00:35,830 --> 00:00:40,942
We have, obviously, quite a large number
of collisions for very small objects,

11
00:00:40,942 --> 00:00:44,782
and we've had some experience
with, for instance,

12
00:00:44,782 --> 00:00:47,672
bringing back a solar array
of the Hubble Space Telescope

13
00:00:47,672 --> 00:00:51,388
during the servicing mission in 1993.

14
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:56,243
And after looking at this solar array,

15
00:00:56,243 --> 00:01:01,214
brought back
to British Aerospace in Bristol,

16
00:01:01,214 --> 00:01:03,802
we could see a number of small impacts

17
00:01:03,802 --> 00:01:06,928
due to collision with small meteoroids.

18
00:01:06,928 --> 00:01:10,672
And, of course, you have a mixture
in this spot of the graph

19
00:01:10,672 --> 00:01:16,076
of natural objects, meteoroids,
and orbital debris of small size.

20
00:01:16,546 --> 00:01:20,637
If you look at the larger size,
in this area here,

21
00:01:20,637 --> 00:01:22,995
you have some contribution of meteoroids,

22
00:01:22,995 --> 00:01:27,095
but you still have data
that had been recorded,

23
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:29,907
partly by the Goldstone radar,

24
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:32,524
the Arecibo radar, also,

25
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:36,003
showing that orbital debris
start to play a role here.

26
00:01:36,003 --> 00:01:41,797
For the size of approximately
1 cm, or 0.10 cm,

27
00:01:41,797 --> 00:01:44,201
you have a significant
contribution of debris,

28
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:47,411
and, of course, if you look
at large objects

29
00:01:48,018 --> 00:01:51,941
of the order of 10 cm, or even 1 m,

30
00:01:51,941 --> 00:01:55,415
there is a significant contribution
of orbital debris.

31
00:01:55,786 --> 00:02:01,248
Now, this data about
the LDEF craters and LDEF data,

32
00:02:01,248 --> 00:02:04,550
LDEF is for Long-Duration
Exposure Facility.

33
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:07,701
This is a spacecraft that was deployed
by the Space Shuttle,

34
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:09,356
and stayed a few years on orbit.

35
00:02:09,356 --> 00:02:12,532
It was brought back to Earth,
and it was a good witness

36
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:18,580
of the spectrum of the orbital debris
and also meteoroid impacts.

37
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,790
So a lot of these data,
especially for the small debris,

38
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,711
was obtained with the long-duration
exposure facility.

39
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:29,907
This is something that we all fear:

40
00:02:29,907 --> 00:02:36,376
the collision on Earth of a large comet's
nucleus, or a large meteoroid.

41
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:38,190
It has happened.

42
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:42,286
It happens every now and then,
and it will happen in the future.

43
00:02:42,719 --> 00:02:46,799
There's one significant event
of this nature

44
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:49,086
that happened about 65 million years ago.

45
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:52,719
This is the so-called
<i>Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction</i>.

46
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:55,417
A very large meteorite hit the Earth,

47
00:02:55,417 --> 00:03:00,821
probably in the region
of the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico,

48
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:04,327
and it was such a dramatic event.

49
00:03:04,327 --> 00:03:09,105
It caused real havoc
on the surface of planet Earth,

50
00:03:09,105 --> 00:03:11,906
and probably caused
the extinction of the dinosaurs.

51
00:03:11,906 --> 00:03:14,755
So, 65 million years ago,
a significant impact.

52
00:03:15,628 --> 00:03:18,191
The probability of such an event is,
of course, very low,

53
00:03:18,191 --> 00:03:20,938
but it has happened,
and it will happen in the future.

54
00:03:20,938 --> 00:03:24,226
If we wait long enough, it will happen,
with a probability of 1.

55
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:29,717
Now another quite significant event
happened in 1908.

56
00:03:30,219 --> 00:03:33,336
There was a large asteroid
that hit the Earth,

57
00:03:33,336 --> 00:03:36,954
in Siberia, in the region of Tunguska,

58
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:39,343
and caused quite a lot
of damage in a forest:

59
00:03:39,343 --> 00:03:42,722
there was about 2000 km² of forest
that was destroyed.

60
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:45,945
Fortunately, it happened
in an area of the Earth

61
00:03:45,945 --> 00:03:48,749
where there is low population density,

62
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:51,634
so to my knowledge
there were no casualties there,

63
00:03:51,634 --> 00:03:54,722
but significant damage to a forest,

64
00:03:54,722 --> 00:03:57,496
and the whole landscape was destroyed.

65
00:03:58,164 --> 00:04:03,230
Another event, that didn't occur
on the planet Earth but on planet Jupiter,

66
00:04:03,230 --> 00:04:06,428
was the impact of several pieces

67
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:11,616
of Comet Shoemaker-Levy, in 1994.

68
00:04:12,108 --> 00:04:15,924
This was one year
after the successful repair

69
00:04:15,924 --> 00:04:20,081
of the Hubble Space Telescope,
and the recovery of its optical qualities.

70
00:04:20,081 --> 00:04:22,719
This is a Hubble Space Telescope picture

71
00:04:22,719 --> 00:04:28,811
showing the impact
of one of the large elements

72
00:04:28,811 --> 00:04:33,345
of this broken nucleus
of the Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9.

73
00:04:33,735 --> 00:04:35,909
You have to remember
that the size of Jupiter

74
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,695
is about 10 times the size of the Earth,

75
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:43,162
so you can see the scar left
by this impact of this large comet object

76
00:04:43,162 --> 00:04:46,511
at the surface of Jupiter
is about the size of the Earth,

77
00:04:46,511 --> 00:04:48,488
or even larger than the Earth.

78
00:04:48,913 --> 00:04:53,779
Another dramatic impact of a meteorite
on Earth is relatively recent.

79
00:04:53,779 --> 00:04:55,511
It happened in Russia,

80
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:57,298
in Chelyabinsk,

81
00:04:57,900 --> 00:05:02,032
in 2013,

82
00:05:02,032 --> 00:05:04,341
in fact on the 15th of February, 2013.

83
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:09,321
There was a lot of recording of this event
by cameras located in cars,

84
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:13,478
and you see here quite
a dramatic view of this meteorite

85
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:17,429
that came at a very shallow angle
in the atmosphere,

86
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,691
and it caused quite a lot of damage.

87
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:23,911
Its size is estimated to be about 20 m,

88
00:05:25,056 --> 00:05:27,933
a mass of about 10,000 tons,

89
00:05:27,933 --> 00:05:30,252
so it was a very,
very, very massive object.

90
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:33,262
It caused a lot of damage,
and caused injuries also,

91
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:36,385
a lot of broken glass,
and this was really dramatic.

92
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:40,903
And it really indicates
that this is something

93
00:05:40,903 --> 00:05:44,572
that has happened,
will happen in the future,

94
00:05:44,572 --> 00:05:48,418
and there's a large effort
undertaken now by spacefaring nations

95
00:05:48,418 --> 00:05:54,287
to be able to detect early enough
such intruders to the Earth,

96
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:58,654
and also we are looking
into ways if we can detect

97
00:06:00,592 --> 00:06:02,796
such an incoming object
threatening the Earth

98
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,728
early enough to make
a rendezvous with a spacecraft

99
00:06:05,728 --> 00:06:08,476
that could possibly cause
a deflection of this object

100
00:06:08,476 --> 00:06:11,042
and would cause it to miss the Earth.

101
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,620
This is one of the techniques
that is being looked at.

102
00:06:14,862 --> 00:06:18,206
Again, if we have a so-called
Near-Earth object,

103
00:06:18,206 --> 00:06:20,668
this is an asteroid
of a relatively large size

104
00:06:20,668 --> 00:06:23,881
that has an orbit relatively close
to the orbit of the Earth

105
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:28,985
and every now and then we have
a relatively close proximity

106
00:06:28,985 --> 00:06:33,932
between such a passing object
and the orbit of the Earth around the Sun,

107
00:06:34,186 --> 00:06:37,463
and for these objects
we could predict early enough,

108
00:06:37,463 --> 00:06:40,818
maybe years or even decades in advance,

109
00:06:40,818 --> 00:06:43,812
that there would be
a really uncomfortable proximity

110
00:06:43,812 --> 00:06:46,474
between such an object and the Earth,
and a possible collision.

111
00:06:46,474 --> 00:06:49,810
In this case, we could -
we are not ready for this yet,

112
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:53,283
but we are looking into ways
of bringing a spacecraft

113
00:06:53,283 --> 00:06:55,578
in the vicinity of this intruder.

114
00:06:55,578 --> 00:06:59,327
Typically, this is one example
of a technique where we would bring

115
00:06:59,327 --> 00:07:03,462
a relatively large-mass spacecraft
close to the intruder,

116
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:07,010
and early enough, years before,

117
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,640
we could maintain
the position of the spacecraft

118
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,180
in the proximity of the asteroid

119
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:16,662
such that with the gravitational effect

120
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:19,272
of this large spacecraft to the asteroid,

121
00:07:19,272 --> 00:07:22,147
it would deviate slightly
the trajectory of the asteroid,

122
00:07:22,147 --> 00:07:23,768
and it would miss the Earth.

123
00:07:23,768 --> 00:07:26,662
This is one of the techniques.
There are others that are being looked at,

124
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:30,594
for instance putting a propulsion system,
an ion propulsion system

125
00:07:30,594 --> 00:07:34,553
on the surface of the intruder,
and deviating its trajectory.

126
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,014
This is, again, a responsibility
of the spacefaring nations,

127
00:07:38,014 --> 00:07:40,144
to find ways of, on one hand,

128
00:07:40,144 --> 00:07:43,796
detect early enough
such threatening asteroids,

129
00:07:43,796 --> 00:07:47,766
and deviate their trajectory
so that they miss the Earth.
