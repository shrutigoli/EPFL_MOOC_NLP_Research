1
00:00:05,309 --> 00:00:09,679
Close to the Earth's surface
we have a magnetic field

2
00:00:10,314 --> 00:00:14,859
which resembles, in terms of its shape,
a bipolar magnetic field,

3
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:17,953
typically the one
that you would get from a magnet

4
00:00:17,953 --> 00:00:21,783
with a North Magnet Pole,
and a South Magnet Pole.

5
00:00:22,604 --> 00:00:28,039
Now, the expression of the amplitude
of the magnetic field

6
00:00:29,524 --> 00:00:32,486
is depicted here as a function

7
00:00:32,486 --> 00:00:34,265
of the distance
to the center of the Earth,

8
00:00:34,265 --> 00:00:36,939
and the so-called "magnetic latitude",

9
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:39,815
which is pretty much like
the Earth's latitude,

10
00:00:39,815 --> 00:00:42,035
with zero degrees at the Equator,

11
00:00:42,035 --> 00:00:45,961
and a +90 at the North Magnetic Pole,

12
00:00:45,961 --> 00:00:49,255
and a -90 at the South Magnetic Pole.

13
00:00:50,126 --> 00:00:54,266
So you see, you have this factor
<i>1 + 3 sin&sup2;</i> of the magnetic latitude,

14
00:00:54,266 --> 00:00:56,697
and the square root of that
times the B_0,

15
00:00:56,697 --> 00:01:01,507
which is the magnetic fields
on the Equator,

16
00:01:01,921 --> 00:01:04,811
and at the distance
from the center of the Earth

17
00:01:04,811 --> 00:01:07,357
equal to the radius of the Earth,
so on the Earth's surface.

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:10,238
And <i>R</i> is the distance
to the center of the Earth.

19
00:01:10,238 --> 00:01:14,781
So this is an expression of <i>B</i>
as a function of <i>R</i> and <i>Î»</i>.

20
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:21,509
And here we have a depiction of this shape

21
00:01:21,509 --> 00:01:23,767
of the magnetic field lines
in the vicinity of the Earth.

22
00:01:23,767 --> 00:01:26,275
Again, I'm talking
about the vicinity of the Earth

23
00:01:26,275 --> 00:01:30,007
being typically one,
up to two Earth radii,

24
00:01:30,007 --> 00:01:32,731
because beyond that we have
variation due to the solar wind,

25
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:34,438
we'll talk about that later.

26
00:01:34,438 --> 00:01:37,204
But this is the shape
of the magnetic field lines.

27
00:01:38,441 --> 00:01:40,082
You have the Earth,

28
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:45,584
North Magnetic Pole
to South Magnetic Pole here.

29
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:50,180
And what you have is a set
of so-called "radiation belts".

30
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:52,896
This is the inner radiation belt,
and outer radiation belt.

31
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:58,272
These are regions where
the magnetic field of the Earth

32
00:01:58,272 --> 00:02:03,353
is creating some regions
where you have an increased density

33
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:07,803
of charged particles,
mainly protons and electrons,

34
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:10,482
and they are moving
to the North and to the South,

35
00:02:10,482 --> 00:02:14,777
they are reflected,
due to the increased density

36
00:02:14,777 --> 00:02:16,588
of magnetic field lines,
they are reflected,

37
00:02:16,588 --> 00:02:18,892
and they come to the North
and they go back to the South,

38
00:02:18,892 --> 00:02:22,143
and to the North, and the South.
They are really trapped in these regions.

39
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:23,958
And these are regions,
which are important,

40
00:02:23,958 --> 00:02:28,279
because you have an increased flux
of protons, electrons.

41
00:02:28,279 --> 00:02:31,191
Electrons are are not too harmful,
but protons could be.

42
00:02:31,539 --> 00:02:34,388
And you also have an increased
amount of radiation

43
00:02:34,388 --> 00:02:37,379
coming from outside of the solar system,

44
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:41,580
typically galactic cosmic rays
that could be trapped in these regions.

45
00:02:42,736 --> 00:02:47,543
The lower boundary
of the inner radiation belt

46
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:52,599
is about 550 to 600 km
above the Earth's surface,

47
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:55,551
so it's above the altitude
of the International Space Station.

48
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:58,644
The ISS is not going anywhere
in the radiation belt,

49
00:02:58,644 --> 00:03:00,612
but I remember when
we had the Hubble mission,

50
00:03:00,612 --> 00:03:04,847
up to 600 km altitude,
we had, sometimes,

51
00:03:04,847 --> 00:03:08,692
a manifestation of the effect
of this inner radiation belt

52
00:03:08,692 --> 00:03:11,020
by flashes in the eyes, for instance.

53
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,722
Now, as I indicated already,

54
00:03:18,722 --> 00:03:22,453
in the inner radiation belt
you have protons and electrons.

55
00:03:22,453 --> 00:03:24,976
In the outer radiation belt
it's mainly electrons.

56
00:03:25,588 --> 00:03:29,815
So the outer radiation belt
is not as harmful to electronic systems

57
00:03:30,396 --> 00:03:32,335
than the inner radiation belt.

58
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:36,061
The energy of these particles
in these belts

59
00:03:36,061 --> 00:03:39,086
is bigger than 30 keV,

60
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:42,431
and all the way to 100 MeV.

61
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:49,421
Now, this is an artist depiction
of the magnetosphere,

62
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:53,728
which is the geometry, and a region,
I would say, around the Earth

63
00:03:53,728 --> 00:03:55,954
which is dominated
by the Earth's magnetic field,

64
00:03:55,954 --> 00:03:59,045
which magnetic field,
is as mentioned before,

65
00:03:59,045 --> 00:04:04,051
pretty much like a dipolar,
bipolar magnetic field

66
00:04:04,051 --> 00:04:05,348
in the vicinity of the Earth.

67
00:04:05,348 --> 00:04:10,976
But it's significantly distorted
when you go away from the surface.

68
00:04:10,976 --> 00:04:16,410
Typically of the order of 5,
up to 10 Earth radii toward the Sun,

69
00:04:17,213 --> 00:04:18,885
there's a significant distortion,

70
00:04:18,885 --> 00:04:21,254
in the anti-Sun directions also.

71
00:04:21,254 --> 00:04:22,802
So on the left-hand side you have,

72
00:04:22,802 --> 00:04:25,684
it's not up to scale,
but you have the Sun,

73
00:04:25,684 --> 00:04:29,830
you have the solar wind flowing
in all directions from the Sun,

74
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:33,553
and when the solar wind,
which is made of charged particles,

75
00:04:33,553 --> 00:04:36,209
interacts with 
the magnetic field of the Earth

76
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:37,659
it distorts it completely,

77
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:40,690
and the boundary
between the magnetosphere

78
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:44,614
and the flow of particles
from the solar wind,

79
00:04:44,614 --> 00:04:47,425
which is mainly protons, electrons,

80
00:04:47,425 --> 00:04:49,562
is called a "magnetopause".

81
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:54,391
And it's interesting to see
that you have certain regions

82
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:56,693
where you have the possibility
for charged particles

83
00:04:56,693 --> 00:04:58,624
to get in the vicinity of the Earth.

84
00:04:58,624 --> 00:05:02,199
Basically, the charged particles
follow the magnetic field lines,

85
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,515
and in the equatorial regions of the Earth

86
00:05:04,515 --> 00:05:06,364
we have protection
against these particles,

87
00:05:06,364 --> 00:05:09,780
because the magnetic field lines
are pretty much horizontal.

88
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:13,393
But in the region of the Magnetic Poles,

89
00:05:13,393 --> 00:05:16,275
you have a possibility
for these particles, the solar wind,

90
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:21,478
to get into the low atmosphere
and create aurora,

91
00:05:21,478 --> 00:05:25,067
or Northern Lights, or Southern Lights,
as we will see afterwards.

92
00:05:25,593 --> 00:05:28,314
In the anti-Sun direction
what is interesting

93
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:32,052
is that the magnetic field lines
of the Earth seem to be open.

94
00:05:32,052 --> 00:05:34,557
They are open to the interstellar medium.

95
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:39,951
Now, this is a very nice picture
of Northern Lights

96
00:05:39,951 --> 00:05:42,362
taken from
the International Space Station.

97
00:05:42,362 --> 00:05:45,494
On the upper right,
you see one of the large solar arrays

98
00:05:45,494 --> 00:05:48,226
of the U.S. segment of ISS.

99
00:05:49,035 --> 00:05:52,471
You have the Earth horizon,
you have the airglow,

100
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:55,452
which we mentioned before,
at about 100 km altitude,

101
00:05:55,452 --> 00:06:00,372
and then you have this magnificent
green light, Northern Lights.

102
00:06:01,059 --> 00:06:04,042
Now, the Northern Lights
and Southern Lights are produced

103
00:06:04,042 --> 00:06:09,218
by excitation of nitrogen,
and mainly oxygen atoms,

104
00:06:09,218 --> 00:06:12,763
by the electrons flowing
from the solar wind.

105
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:16,575
And typically the Northern
and Southern lights

106
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:20,017
are produced at about
the altitude of the airglow,

107
00:06:20,017 --> 00:06:23,904
100 km altitude and above,
and somewhat below,

108
00:06:23,904 --> 00:06:26,545
but mainly above the airglow altitude.

109
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,795
It's nice to see on this picture, also,

110
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:34,389
just above and to the left of the center
you have the constellation Orion,

111
00:06:34,389 --> 00:06:37,319
with the three aligned stars
of the Orion's Belt.

112
00:06:38,284 --> 00:06:39,515
This is a view of the Earth

113
00:06:39,515 --> 00:06:43,170
from the International
Space Station, taken recently.

114
00:06:43,593 --> 00:06:45,779
We are over the Indian Ocean:
it's at night.

115
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,375
We have the landscape
illuminated by the Moon,

116
00:06:49,306 --> 00:06:53,156
and we have a beautiful view
of the Southern Lights.

117
00:06:53,414 --> 00:06:56,803
We are in the vicinity
of the South Magnetic Pole,

118
00:06:56,803 --> 00:06:59,357
which is somewhat
on the right-hand side of the picture,

119
00:06:59,357 --> 00:07:01,757
and a very clear view
of the Southern Lights,

120
00:07:01,757 --> 00:07:04,567
and also of the airglow,
which gives you a scale

121
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:07,370
of the height of
the Southern Lights themselves,

122
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:10,172
the airglow being at 100 km
above the Earth's surface.

123
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:11,795
It's accelerated motion.

124
00:07:11,795 --> 00:07:15,522
It's been taken so that you have
about 10 times increase

125
00:07:15,522 --> 00:07:18,508
in the velocity of the Space Station
versus the Earth.

126
00:07:18,508 --> 00:07:21,136
We move fast, but not as fast
as you can see here.

127
00:07:21,628 --> 00:07:24,092
It's interesting to see the vertical line

128
00:07:24,092 --> 00:07:26,317
in the structure of these Southern Lights,

129
00:07:26,317 --> 00:07:28,527
which are along the magnetic field line,

130
00:07:28,527 --> 00:07:30,935
which, in the vicinity
of the South Magnetic Pole,

131
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:32,698
are close to the vertical.

132
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:35,894
You see also a lot of dynamics
in the Southern Lights.
