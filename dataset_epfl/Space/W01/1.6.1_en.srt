1
00:00:05,346 --> 00:00:09,001
Today we will look at the orbital
lifetime of satellites.

2
00:00:09,001 --> 00:00:13,408
Satellites on a low Earth orbit.
Low Earth orbit means between

3
00:00:13,408 --> 00:00:19,978
about 200 kilometers and 2,000
kilometers. And all the satellites

4
00:00:19,978 --> 00:00:25,426
within this range of altitude have
a slow decay of their orbit because

5
00:00:25,426 --> 00:00:31,584
of the atmospheric drag. They are
basically in the high ionosphere, and

6
00:00:32,184 --> 00:00:38,062
the decrease in altitude will be such that
there will be on one hand an increase

7
00:00:38,062 --> 00:00:43,629
of the orbital speed, there will be a
denser atmosphere, so increased drag.

8
00:00:43,629 --> 00:00:47,688
Its process is such that although it
starts slowly at the end it goes

9
00:00:47,688 --> 00:00:53,325
very rapidly and it ends up with
a fiery reentry of the satellite

10
00:00:53,325 --> 00:00:56,172
in the atmosphere, a destructive reentry.

11
00:00:56,172 --> 00:01:02,460
Now we'll consider only a circular
orbit, a low Earth orbit, but of

12
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:06,597
a circular shape. Obviously if you have
a highly elliptical orbit you are going to

13
00:01:06,597 --> 00:01:11,380
have more decay in the perigee of the
orbit and very little at the apogee,

14
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:15,028
and it’s a more complex process but we'll
consider circular orbits.

15
00:01:16,278 --> 00:01:21,837
Here we have a very classical expression
of the force of drag using aerodynamics.

16
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:26,039
In fact in aerodynamics you have the
same for lift and for drag, but here

17
00:01:26,039 --> 00:01:31,209
we'll consider only drag. The force of
drag is equal to the dynamic pressure,

18
00:01:31,209 --> 00:01:39,656
<i>1/2ρV&sup2; </i>times the drag coefficient,
<i>C_D</i>, and the so-called reference area <i>A_n</i>,

19
00:01:39,656 --> 00:01:45,186
which is basically the area of the
satellite or the spacecraft exposed to

20
00:01:45,186 --> 00:01:48,980
the air, or perpendicular
to the velocity vector.

21
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:53,685
And you have the expression of the force
of drag, and obviously the acceleration

22
00:01:53,685 --> 00:01:58,455
will be the force divided by <i>m</i>. 
And you can express that drag

23
00:01:58,455 --> 00:02:04,285
acceleration is the dynamic pressure,
<i>1/2ρV&sup2;</i>  divided by the so-called

24
00:02:04,285 --> 00:02:09,037
ballistic coefficient,
in kilogram per square meter.

25
00:02:09,997 --> 00:02:13,088
Here we have the ballistic coefficient,
so it's the mass of the spacecraft

26
00:02:13,088 --> 00:02:19,177
divided by the drag coefficient 
and this so-called reference area.

27
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:23,076
Now you have to understand that
the higher the ballistic coefficient,

28
00:02:23,076 --> 00:02:27,279
the longer the lifetime of the satellite. 
The ballistic coefficient to a certain

29
00:02:27,279 --> 00:02:32,607
degree is a measure of the resistance of
the spacecraft to the decay of the orbit

30
00:02:32,607 --> 00:02:35,574
due to the high atmosphere.

31
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:40,306
Now, a definition of An,
you have it on the upper right.

32
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:45,134
Once again it's the area of the spacecraft
perpendicular to the velocity vector,

33
00:02:45,134 --> 00:02:48,744
and depending on the shape of
the spacecraft you have different

34
00:02:48,744 --> 00:02:55,383
values of the drag coefficient. And we
have the case of an elongated object

35
00:02:55,383 --> 00:02:58,252
with a long axis in the direction of the
velocity vector where you have

36
00:02:58,252 --> 00:03:02,941
a low drag coefficient. You have a medium
drag coefficient for a sphere,

37
00:03:02,941 --> 00:03:07,333
and a high drag coefficient if you have
a plate or for instance a solar array,

38
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:13,313
with the plane of the plate perpendicular
to the velocity vector. The values of the

39
00:03:13,313 --> 00:03:18,607
drag coefficient are normally between
2 and 4. You have two for a sphere.

40
00:03:19,917 --> 00:03:26,046
This is the result of modelling of the
lifetime of a satellite, and again

41
00:03:26,046 --> 00:03:29,953
the lifetime is the time between
the installation of the satellite on

42
00:03:29,953 --> 00:03:35,213
a circular orbit at a certain height above
the Earth's surface until the end of

43
00:03:35,213 --> 00:03:39,336
the decay and the return to Earth,
again a destructive return to the Earth.

44
00:03:39,336 --> 00:03:43,457
As a function of the starting altitude
of the orbit, again we consider only

45
00:03:43,457 --> 00:03:49,512
circular orbits here. Now, you have
different curves here, and you have sets

46
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:53,240
of curves corresponding
to three different values

47
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,637
of the ballistic coefficient.

48
00:03:54,637 --> 00:03:59,003
You have a low ballistic coefficient
of 20kg per square meter,

49
00:03:59,003 --> 00:04:04,208
you have a medium ballistic coefficient
of 65kg per square meter,

50
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:08,056
and a high ballistic coefficient
of 200kg per square meter.

51
00:04:08,056 --> 00:04:14,578
Again, the high ballistic coefficient
corresponds to a better resistance

52
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:19,211
of the satellite against the decay
of the orbit due to the friction

53
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:23,960
of the atmosphere. So a longer lifetime
for a high ballistic coefficient.

54
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:28,909
If we look at the high altitude above,
about 700 kilometers above the Earth's

55
00:04:28,909 --> 00:04:35,924
surface, obviously we have the high
ballistic coefficient curve,

56
00:04:35,924 --> 00:04:39,786
which gives us a much longer lifetime
than the low value.

57
00:04:39,786 --> 00:04:44,487
Now it's interesting to see for the
medium altitude, typically

58
00:04:44,487 --> 00:04:52,010
between 300 and 600 kilometers altitude,
we have a split, depending on whether the

59
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:58,315
installation of the orbit of the satellite
was at solar minimum or solar maximum.

60
00:04:58,315 --> 00:05:03,783
If I consider now the curve corresponding
to 200kg per square meter, we see that

61
00:05:03,783 --> 00:05:13,231
at around 550 kilometers altitude and
below, if you launch at solar minimum,

62
00:05:13,231 --> 00:05:15,132
you have a much longer lifetime.

63
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:19,294
This is this part of the curve. 
Then if you launch at solar maximum,

64
00:05:19,294 --> 00:05:23,293
obviously because of the expansion of the
atmosphere, for the medium altitudes,

65
00:05:23,293 --> 00:05:28,750
typically between 200 and 600 kilometers
altitude, the fact of the expansion

66
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:37,343
of the atmosphere has a definite
effect on the lifetime of the satellite.

67
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:41,979
So, again at high altitude it's not
a factor, at very low altitude, at around

68
00:05:41,979 --> 00:05:48,527
200 kilometers, the effect of the time
when you launch the satellite versus

69
00:05:48,527 --> 00:05:52,854
the solar maximum or solar minimum is
unimportant, but this factor is important

70
00:05:52,854 --> 00:05:57,121
for the medium altitude,
between about 300 to 600 kilometers.

71
00:05:58,121 --> 00:06:05,424
Here the data for some satellites, which
give you the cross-sectional area,

72
00:06:05,424 --> 00:06:10,438
which we call the reference area. 
We have the values here in square meters.

73
00:06:10,438 --> 00:06:15,339
The drag coefficient for the max cross
area, for the min cross area,

74
00:06:15,339 --> 00:06:18,616
and the ballistic coefficient
you have the values here.

75
00:06:18,616 --> 00:06:25,734
Now if you have a spherical satellite,
which is the case for Explorer-17,

76
00:06:25,734 --> 00:06:31,812
spherical satellites, as already
mentioned have a drag coefficient of 2,

77
00:06:31,812 --> 00:06:36,217
and you see that the maximum drag
coefficient that you can have is about 4,

78
00:06:36,217 --> 00:06:40,638
so drag coefficients are always
comprised between 2 and 4.

79
00:06:41,628 --> 00:06:47,195
So these are values of reference which
are of interest, obviously, if you have

80
00:06:47,195 --> 00:06:52,521
cylindrical satellites you are going to 
have a different drag coefficient

81
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:57,407
depending on the orientation of the
cylinder versus the velocity vector.

82
00:06:57,407 --> 00:07:03,120
Just for information, the International
Space Station ballistic coefficient

83
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,896
is approximately 50 kilograms per square
meter. That's a minimum value when it has

84
00:07:06,896 --> 00:07:13,894
the lowest drag possible, with basically
the so-called x body vector of the

85
00:07:13,894 --> 00:07:17,577
International Space Station in the
direction of the velocity vector.
