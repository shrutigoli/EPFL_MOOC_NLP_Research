1
00:00:05,324 --> 00:00:08,910
The law of gravitation,
another fundamental law of Newton,

2
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,531
expresses the force between two bodies
of mass <i>m</i> and mass <i>M</i>,

3
00:00:14,531 --> 00:00:16,828
separated by a distance of <i>r</i>.

4
00:00:16,828 --> 00:00:20,096
This force is equal to
the gravitational constant <i>G</i>,

5
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:25,045
multiplied by the product of the masses
and divided by the square of the distance

6
00:00:25,045 --> 00:00:26,675
between these two masses.

7
00:00:26,675 --> 00:00:28,659
What we'll be doing
in the course very often

8
00:00:28,659 --> 00:00:30,561
will be to express these forces,

9
00:00:30,561 --> 00:00:33,771
and sometimes it will be also 
the energy, per unit mass.

10
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:37,863
So <i>F</i> divided by <i>m</i>
is equal to <i>μ</i> over <i>r</i> squared.

11
00:00:37,873 --> 00:00:40,302
The <i>μ</i> is equal 
to the gravitational constant

12
00:00:40,302 --> 00:00:47,281
times the mass of the central body,
<i>G</i> times <i>M</i> is going to be <i>μ</i>,

13
00:00:47,281 --> 00:00:50,055
and we'll be using this symbology
for most of the course.

14
00:00:51,425 --> 00:00:54,642
Now, the gravitational constant
is given at the bottom of the slide,

15
00:00:54,642 --> 00:00:59,240
and at the end of this section
you can download

16
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,457
a series of constants and values
that will be used in the course.

17
00:01:03,457 --> 00:01:06,391
Now let's look at the laws
of mechanics for rotations.

18
00:01:06,391 --> 00:01:08,519
So far we've done it for translations.

19
00:01:10,683 --> 00:01:14,669
<i>F</i> equaled <i>dp</i> over <i>dt</i>,
the time derivative of the momentum.

20
00:01:15,235 --> 00:01:19,779
Now if we have the case of a rotation
around a center of rotation,

21
00:01:19,779 --> 00:01:22,903
expressed by the little cross
in this drawing here,

22
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:31,325
we can just replace the force
in the second law of Newton by the torque.

23
00:01:31,325 --> 00:01:36,923
The torque being the cross product
of the radius vector by the force.

24
00:01:36,923 --> 00:01:40,088
Now the cross product, 
we have to understand how it works

25
00:01:40,088 --> 00:01:41,431
in terms of directions.

26
00:01:41,431 --> 00:01:43,392
You can take the right hand,

27
00:01:43,392 --> 00:01:46,636
and the first vector
is going to be the thumb, <i>r</i>,

28
00:01:46,636 --> 00:01:49,311
the second vector
is going to be the force,

29
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:52,576
and the torque is going to be
perpendicular to the first two.

30
00:01:52,576 --> 00:01:58,576
The direction of the torque is going to be
in the direction of the third finger,

31
00:01:58,576 --> 00:02:00,474
as I'm showing here with my right hand.

32
00:02:00,474 --> 00:02:02,760
Be sure to use the right hand,
not the left hand.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,645
With the left hand, you are going to get
the wrong result in terms of direction.

34
00:02:06,645 --> 00:02:10,241
Now, the second law of Newton
for rotations, again,

35
00:02:10,241 --> 00:02:15,815
you replace the force by the torque,
and you replace the momentum <i>p</i> vectorial,

36
00:02:15,815 --> 00:02:21,275
by the angular momentum,
which is the cross product of <i>r</i> and <i>p</i>.

37
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:25,368
And again, you use the same
right-hand rule in order to determine

38
00:02:25,368 --> 00:02:29,171
which will be the change
in the direction of <i>L</i>,

39
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:35,173
typically the change in direction
of the rotation rate <i>ω</i>,

40
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:40,278
whenever you exercise
a certain torque on a rotating body.

41
00:02:41,216 --> 00:02:47,524
Now, the angular momentum, <i>L</i>,
with a vector, for a solid body,

42
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:52,901
when we have a fixed rotation axis,
which I express here as a small <i>Δ</i>,

43
00:02:54,116 --> 00:02:59,718
the angular momentum is going to be
the product of the moment of inertia <i>I_Δ</i>,

44
00:02:59,718 --> 00:03:04,724
which will be defined in a second,
and ω, the rotation rate,

45
00:03:04,724 --> 00:03:06,510
a vector in radians per second.

46
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,181
The moment of inertia itself,

47
00:03:08,181 --> 00:03:13,311
if we have a body consisting of a series 
of small individual bodies,

48
00:03:13,311 --> 00:03:15,910
each of them with a distance <i>r_i</i>

49
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:20,193
to the axis of rotation,
and each of them being of a mass <i>m_i</i>,

50
00:03:20,193 --> 00:03:24,633
you just do the sum of the product
of the masses times

51
00:03:24,633 --> 00:03:27,534
the square of the distance
of these individual masses

52
00:03:27,534 --> 00:03:28,964
to the axis of rotation.

53
00:03:28,964 --> 00:03:31,295
And of course,
if you have a continuous body,

54
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:35,973
you do the integral over the volume
of <i>r</i> squared <i>dm</i>,

55
00:03:35,973 --> 00:03:37,825
which is the element of mass,

56
00:03:37,825 --> 00:03:41,285
which is equivalent 
to the density at that location,

57
00:03:41,285 --> 00:03:44,074
multiplied by the element of volume.

58
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:48,249
Now let's take the example
of the precession of a spinning top.

59
00:03:48,249 --> 00:03:51,516
Here you have a spinning top
with an axis of rotation

60
00:03:51,516 --> 00:03:54,760
which has somewhat deviated
from the local vertical.

61
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:01,288
And you have the radius vector
from the point of contact with the soil,

62
00:04:01,288 --> 00:04:05,739
all the way to the center of mass,
and you have the gravitational force <i>mg</i>

63
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:11,768
exercising this effect on the center
of mass of the spinning top.

64
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:17,939
Now, if you do the <i>r</i> cross <i>F</i>, the torque,
in order to determine which direction

65
00:04:17,939 --> 00:04:22,745
the <i>ω</i> will be moving, you have
<i>r</i> upwards, somewhat to the left,

66
00:04:22,745 --> 00:04:29,228
and you have <i>F</i> downwards,
so it will give you torque

67
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,162
outside of your computer screen,
towards you,

68
00:04:32,162 --> 00:04:36,849
so it will give you this direction 
that you see on top of the spinning top,

69
00:04:36,849 --> 00:04:38,643
in terms of the precession.

70
00:04:38,643 --> 00:04:41,283
So if you look from upwards
on the spinning top,

71
00:04:41,283 --> 00:04:44,152
it's going to be
precessing counterclockwise.
