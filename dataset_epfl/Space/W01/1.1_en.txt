Hello everyone, welcome to Unit 1:
Brief Review of the Laws of Mechanics and Introduction to the Space Environment.
By the way, we have a beautiful picture of a very young Moon in the background.
This is the Moon only a few hours after New Moon, with a very, very thin crescent.
It's impossible to see such a view of the Moon from the Earth, because from an angular point of view, the Moon is so close to the Sun, that it's only from space that you can get such a shot, taken from the International Space Station.
Now, this week we'll talk about 1.2, a Review of the Laws of Mechanics.
1.3, there will be an Introduction to the New Space Environment.
1.4 will be Magnetic Field in the Sun.
1.5, Radiation Environment.
1.6 Orbital Lifetime, Space Debris, and Asteroid/Comet Collision Threats.
We've prepared some practice quizzes after each video to make sure that you have understood the concepts explained in these videos.
Each section, from 1.2 to 1.6, is concluded by a control quiz.
In addition, there is a test at the end of this Unit.
We encourage you to do all the quizzes and the test, but note that only the control quiz at the end of each section, and the test, will contribute to the final grade.
Now, to illustrate this Unit we have prepared a focus on Space Debris Observation and Removal with the interviews of 
Thomas Schildknecht and Muriel Richard, two Swiss experts, on the subject of space debris.
Looking at these is facultative, but we encourage you to watch these interviews in order to deepen your knowledge about this particular subject
