1
00:00:05,804 --> 00:00:08,345
Conservation laws. 
These are fundamental laws

2
00:00:08,345 --> 00:00:12,235
that we'll be using very often
in the rest of the course.

3
00:00:13,667 --> 00:00:16,198
But first of all,
before we get to these laws,

4
00:00:16,198 --> 00:00:18,329
we need to define the potential energy

5
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:22,545
of a spacecraft of a mass <i>m</i>
in the gravitational field

6
00:00:22,545 --> 00:00:25,889
of a much larger mass <i>M</i>.

7
00:00:25,889 --> 00:00:27,810
And this <i>M</i> could be
the mass of the Earth,

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,456
if we have a spacecraft on orbit
around the Earth,

9
00:00:30,456 --> 00:00:32,153
or it could be the mass of the Sun,

10
00:00:32,153 --> 00:00:34,665
if we have an interplanetary trajectory.

11
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:37,786
Now you see the drawing, <i>M</i> and <i>m</i>.

12
00:00:37,786 --> 00:00:40,359
The <i>m</i> with a velocity <i>v</i>.

13
00:00:40,359 --> 00:00:43,488
And again, we have a <i>M</i>
much larger than <i>m</i>,

14
00:00:43,488 --> 00:00:45,891
so the center of mass of the two bodies

15
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:49,165
is basically at the center
of the large mass, <i>M</i>.

16
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:54,438
Now, the potential energy
is equal to <i>-GM</i>

17
00:00:54,438 --> 00:00:57,839
(<i>G</i> is the gravitational constant, <i>M</i>)

18
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:01,166
times the mass of the small body
divided by <i>r</i>,

19
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,437
the distance between
the large body and the spacecraft.

20
00:01:04,701 --> 00:01:09,082
Again, most of the time
when it's for force, or for energy

21
00:01:09,082 --> 00:01:12,493
we'll be using a unit mass,

22
00:01:12,892 --> 00:01:17,481
so the potential energy per unit mass
is equal to -<i> &micro; /r</i>,

23
00:01:17,481 --> 00:01:21,978
<i>&micro;</i> being <i>G</i> times <i>M</i>,
the mass of the large body.

24
00:01:24,682 --> 00:01:29,196
Let's see for now the kinetic energy
for a spacecraft of mass <i>m</i>,

25
00:01:29,196 --> 00:01:32,935
and the gravitational field
of a much larger mass <i>M</i>.

26
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:36,959
You see the drawing here;
you have the velocity of the small body,

27
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:41,442
the kinetic energy is equal to <i>&frac12; mv&sup2; <i>.

28
00:01:41,446 --> 00:01:45,432
You don't have the mass of the large body
involved, obviously, in this.

29
00:01:45,432 --> 00:01:49,583
And again, we most of the time
express it per unit mass.

30
00:01:49,583 --> 00:01:54,360
So kinetic energy per unit mass
is equal to <i>&frac12; v&sup2;</i>.

31
00:01:56,486 --> 00:01:58,394
The three conservation laws that we have,

32
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:00,174
and again, these are
absolutely fundamental,

33
00:02:00,174 --> 00:02:02,259
is the conservation of momentum.

34
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:05,666
If you have an isolated system
with the absence of any forces

35
00:02:05,666 --> 00:02:07,970
you have a conservation of the momentum,

36
00:02:07,970 --> 00:02:11,855
<i>p</i> vector, equal to <i>m v vector</i>.

37
00:02:12,602 --> 00:02:16,445
The second equivalent law
for rotation is the conservation

38
00:02:16,445 --> 00:02:22,047
of the angular momentum,
<i>r x p vector</i>  in an isolated system.

39
00:02:22,047 --> 00:02:25,640
This time not in the absence of force,
but in the absence of torques.

40
00:02:26,203 --> 00:02:29,144
Now, the third law,
the conservation of mechanical energy,

41
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:31,371
is absolutely fundamental.

42
00:02:31,371 --> 00:02:35,217
Potential plus kinetic energy
in an isolated system,

43
00:02:35,217 --> 00:02:39,203
again in the absence
of external forces and torques,

44
00:02:39,203 --> 00:02:42,152
and in a conservative force field.

45
00:02:42,152 --> 00:02:44,909
And a conservative force field
is applicable

46
00:02:44,909 --> 00:02:49,496
for gravitational force field
or electrical field.

47
00:02:50,076 --> 00:02:53,996
It's a field within which if you go
from one place to the other,

48
00:02:53,996 --> 00:02:55,498
whatever the path you use

49
00:02:55,498 --> 00:02:58,131
to go from one place
to the other within this field,

50
00:02:58,131 --> 00:03:02,692
you'll be using the same energy,
independent of the path

51
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:06,395
between one point A
and one point B within this field.

52
00:03:06,717 --> 00:03:11,659
So, within a conservative force field,
gravitational or electrical,

53
00:03:11,659 --> 00:03:15,588
you have the conservation
of mechanical energy,

54
00:03:15,588 --> 00:03:20,227
and this mechanical energy
is defined as the sum

55
00:03:20,227 --> 00:03:24,469
of the potential energy
and the kinetic energy.

56
00:03:27,037 --> 00:03:28,550
You see these here.

57
00:03:29,021 --> 00:03:31,921
If you have a spacecraft with a mass <i>m</i>,

58
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:34,850
with a velocity <i>v_1</i> as you have here,

59
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:38,863
and it's moving over there
with a velocity <i>v_2</i>,

60
00:03:38,863 --> 00:03:42,433
the same mass, no change of mass,
and no friction in between,

61
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:44,419
you have a conservative force field.

62
00:03:44,419 --> 00:03:47,129
If it was a non-conservative
force field you could go

63
00:03:47,129 --> 00:03:50,482
from one place to the other
with a different amount of energy change

64
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:55,707
because of a dissipating medium
like an atmosphere,

65
00:03:55,707 --> 00:03:58,986
or some dissipating force of some sort.

66
00:03:58,986 --> 00:04:01,277
But if you have a conservative force field

67
00:04:01,277 --> 00:04:05,780
you really have the sum
of the potential and kinetic energy

68
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:07,098
being the same when you go

69
00:04:07,098 --> 00:04:09,636
from one place to the other
within this field.

70
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:13,447
Conservation of mechanical energy
in a conservative force field.

71
00:04:13,657 --> 00:04:16,357
Very important conservation law.

72
00:04:16,894 --> 00:04:21,839
Now, you have here translation
of important terms of mechanics.

73
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:28,841
We have different terms in English,
on the left-hand side,

74
00:04:28,841 --> 00:04:31,489
force, mass, speed or velocity, momentum,

75
00:04:31,489 --> 00:04:34,461
angular momentum, torque,
and moment of inertia,

76
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:39,859
and we have here the translation
in French, in German, in Spanish,

77
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:44,945
<i>en Français, auf Deutsch,
y también en español</i>,

78
00:04:44,945 --> 00:04:48,436
and we encourage you
to provide us with translations

79
00:04:48,436 --> 00:04:51,959
of these fundamental terms
in the various languages

80
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,248
which are your languages.

81
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:54,438
Thank you.
