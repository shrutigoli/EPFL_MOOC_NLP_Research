1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,750
So, hello. This is Muriel Richard-Noca.

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:17,750
I'm a space engineer at the EPFL
Space Engineering Center.

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,539
I've been doing space
system engineering for a while,

4
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:24,439
and also running the SwissCube

5
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:26,279
as the project manager.

6
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:30,539
And I'm actually currently running
the Clean Space program,

7
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:33,979
also as a project manager.

8
00:00:39,134 --> 00:00:41,615
The question about graveyard orbits

9
00:00:41,615 --> 00:00:44,262
arrives at the end of the mission.

10
00:00:44,262 --> 00:00:47,638
When you're done with your satellite
scientific experiments

11
00:00:47,638 --> 00:00:52,508
or commercial application,
the question comes,

12
00:00:52,508 --> 00:00:55,260
what do you do with your satellite?

13
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,231
If your satellite was launched
below 2,000 kilometer altitude,

14
00:01:00,231 --> 00:01:05,241
what we call the LEO orbit,
the IADC,

15
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:11,124
the Inter-Agency Space Debris
Coordination Committee,

16
00:01:11,124 --> 00:01:14,974
recommends that your satellite
be brought back down

17
00:01:14,974 --> 00:01:18,524
into Earth's atmosphere
within the 25 years

18
00:01:18,524 --> 00:01:20,974
after the mission completion.

19
00:01:20,974 --> 00:01:23,284
Another option that you have

20
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:27,054
when you're below
this 2,000 kilometer altitude

21
00:01:27,054 --> 00:01:30,761
is to actually raise
your satellite's orbit

22
00:01:30,761 --> 00:01:34,244
above the 2,000 kilometers,
and at that point,

23
00:01:34,244 --> 00:01:39,138
your satellite could stay there
above it for much longer than 25 years.

24
00:01:39,138 --> 00:01:41,991
Say, for a very, very long time.

25
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:45,492
So that's what happen
to the low Earth orbit satellites.

26
00:01:45,492 --> 00:01:50,262
For the GEO satellites
similar graveyard orbits exist

27
00:01:50,262 --> 00:01:54,644
and those graveyard orbits
are about 300 kilometers above

28
00:01:54,644 --> 00:01:59,951
the typical 36,000 kilometer
altitude orbits.

29
00:02:00,756 --> 00:02:03,796
The purpose of the graveyard orbits

30
00:02:03,796 --> 00:02:07,526
are to put the old satellites
that are at the end of life

31
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:09,516
that do not function any more,

32
00:02:09,516 --> 00:02:12,866
to put them into a place
that does not perturb

33
00:02:12,866 --> 00:02:15,076
the operational satellites.

34
00:02:21,247 --> 00:02:25,557
The purpose of the Clean-mE program
was to start development

35
00:02:25,557 --> 00:02:29,247
and understand better
what are the challenges

36
00:02:29,247 --> 00:02:33,021
that are linked with the orbital debris,

37
00:02:33,021 --> 00:02:37,481
and also typically to look at
what would be required

38
00:02:37,481 --> 00:02:41,251
in order to go ahead
and go up there

39
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:42,941
and remove the debris.

40
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:48,021
So what would be the challenges
linked to this removal of debris,

41
00:02:48,021 --> 00:02:51,509
which are basically uncooperative.

42
00:02:51,509 --> 00:02:57,219
So during about three - four years

43
00:02:57,221 --> 00:02:59,751
of this Clean-mE program

44
00:02:59,751 --> 00:03:05,027
we became smarter on the issues
of active debris removal,

45
00:03:05,027 --> 00:03:09,517
and we made some
developments with students

46
00:03:09,517 --> 00:03:11,997
on the robotics aspects,

47
00:03:11,997 --> 00:03:15,497
on space mechanisms
to actually grab debris

48
00:03:15,497 --> 00:03:20,745
and started some developments
on image recognition

49
00:03:20,745 --> 00:03:25,015
and image processing in order
to provide a better understanding

50
00:03:25,015 --> 00:03:28,777
of the debris once the chaser
is very close to it

51
00:03:28,777 --> 00:03:32,467
and on its rotations,
on its state,

52
00:03:32,467 --> 00:03:35,805
and also on its texture.

53
00:03:35,805 --> 00:03:38,935
Were there flakes?
Were there MLIs? [MLI=Multi Layer Insulation]

54
00:03:38,935 --> 00:03:44,518
So pieces of the surface
of the debris that would be out.

55
00:03:46,229 --> 00:03:49,539
Are there solar arrays
that could be damaged

56
00:03:49,539 --> 00:03:52,169
after many, many years in space?

57
00:03:52,169 --> 00:03:56,034
So all of this required some
specific image processing,

58
00:03:56,034 --> 00:03:59,781
which we started doing
during this Clean-mE program.

59
00:04:04,992 --> 00:04:07,532
Once we got to know enough,

60
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:12,722
and as I said, became
a bit more aware of the challenges

61
00:04:12,722 --> 00:04:19,742
of active debris removal, in 2012,
we decided to actually

62
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:22,767
make an implementation
of what we had found,

63
00:04:22,767 --> 00:04:27,257
and we created this project
called CleanSpace One.

64
00:04:27,257 --> 00:04:31,540
And the objectives of CleanSpace One
are basically very simple.

65
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,529
The first one is to increase
the awareness in the world

66
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:37,529
and with the students

67
00:04:37,529 --> 00:04:40,849
that orbital debris
are something very important,

68
00:04:40,849 --> 00:04:43,249
that we cannot neglect it any more,

69
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:47,239
such that the new students
that will become engineers,

70
00:04:47,239 --> 00:04:52,054
so basically you, are aware that
when you design a space mission,

71
00:04:52,054 --> 00:04:55,076
we should not forget
about the end of life.

72
00:04:55,514 --> 00:04:58,264
So that was the primary objective.

73
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:01,764
The secondary objective
of CleanSpace One is to actually

74
00:05:01,764 --> 00:05:05,554
come up with miniaturized technologies

75
00:05:05,554 --> 00:05:08,754
in order to perform this
uncooperative rendezvous.

76
00:05:08,754 --> 00:05:11,774
And during that flight
and during that mission,

77
00:05:11,774 --> 00:05:15,851
is to demonstrate and validate
these new technologies.

78
00:05:16,204 --> 00:05:20,999
The third aspect which was also
very important to us

79
00:05:20,999 --> 00:05:23,307
was to actually go and do it,

80
00:05:23,307 --> 00:05:28,277
perform a debris removal
on one of the two objects

81
00:05:28,277 --> 00:05:32,527
that belong to Switzerland,
meaning SwissCube.

82
00:05:32,527 --> 00:05:36,065
SwissCube was a target of choice

83
00:05:36,065 --> 00:05:38,785
because it actually
belongs to Switzerland.

84
00:05:38,785 --> 00:05:43,255
And so we don't enter into political
issues because of that.

85
00:05:48,468 --> 00:05:53,248
The mission scenario
for CleanSpace One is quite simple.

86
00:05:54,561 --> 00:05:58,301
We're going to be launching on an orbit
which hopefully is not very far away

87
00:05:58,301 --> 00:06:04,111
from SwissCube orbit, and we'll start
performing phasing maneuvers

88
00:06:04,111 --> 00:06:06,799
and orbit alignment maneuvers

89
00:06:06,799 --> 00:06:12,996
in order to find ourselves exactly
in the same orbital plane of SwissCube.

90
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:16,796
At that point, when we are in
the same orbital plane,

91
00:06:16,796 --> 00:06:20,251
we'll make maneuvers
to come closer to it.

92
00:06:20,251 --> 00:06:25,244
And the way we would do this
is by knowing the position of SwissCube.

93
00:06:25,244 --> 00:06:27,524
And we know this position
of the SwissCube

94
00:06:27,524 --> 00:06:32,714
thanks to assets on the ground,
radars and radar networks

95
00:06:32,714 --> 00:06:35,094
that already exist on the ground.

96
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:39,504
Those radars provide to us every day
what we call two-line elements,

97
00:06:39,504 --> 00:06:42,753
which are the orbital elements
that are calculated

98
00:06:42,753 --> 00:06:45,293
from their radar observations.

99
00:06:45,293 --> 00:06:49,244
We have some idea
of where SwissCube is.

100
00:06:49,244 --> 00:06:52,824
So the first phase will be
the phasing with the orbit

101
00:06:52,824 --> 00:06:56,361
and then the phasing
with the SwissCube itself.

102
00:06:57,244 --> 00:07:02,731
At that point, when we will be
probably around 50 kilometers

103
00:07:02,731 --> 00:07:07,987
coming down to about 10 kilometers
or so from SwissCube,

104
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:11,047
we will have to start a phase

105
00:07:11,047 --> 00:07:15,777
which will be to determine
its actual position.

106
00:07:15,777 --> 00:07:21,237
This determination will be done
by a phase of detection.

107
00:07:21,244 --> 00:07:24,544
SwissCube is very small.
It's 10 by 10 by 10 cm.

108
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,234
So it's about that big.

109
00:07:26,234 --> 00:07:29,538
And it has solar panels
on each of these faces,

110
00:07:29,538 --> 00:07:31,778
which make it quite dark.

111
00:07:31,778 --> 00:07:37,779
So the knowledge from the TLEs
of the position of SwissCube [TLE=Two-line element set]

112
00:07:37,779 --> 00:07:44,125
are valid to about one kilometer
to, in the cross track,

113
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,025
about five kilometers.

114
00:07:46,025 --> 00:07:49,275
So there will be this region
where we have to come close

115
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:52,545
but we are not sure exactly
where SwissCube is.

116
00:07:52,545 --> 00:07:57,535
So we're going to have to start
sensors to do the detection

117
00:07:57,535 --> 00:07:59,535
to find SwissCube.

118
00:07:59,535 --> 00:08:02,525
And currently, the sensors
that we're planning on using

119
00:08:02,525 --> 00:08:05,805
are an infra-red camera
and a radar.

120
00:08:05,805 --> 00:08:09,035
Once SwissCube is detected,

121
00:08:09,035 --> 00:08:12,274
we will get closer and closer to it

122
00:08:12,274 --> 00:08:15,754
making sure at every step
that we're not on the path of collision

123
00:08:15,754 --> 00:08:17,564
of SwissCube, of course.

124
00:08:17,564 --> 00:08:23,030
And once we get close enough,
we'll say 100 to 200 meters,

125
00:08:24,249 --> 00:08:28,039
we will start what we call
"an identification phase."

126
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,779
During that phase,
we will take pictures of the object.

127
00:08:31,779 --> 00:08:35,299
We'll send down the pictures
to the ground of the object

128
00:08:35,989 --> 00:08:40,627
to reassure the world
that we're picking the right debris.

129
00:08:41,139 --> 00:08:44,571
Once that is done,
we'll come even closer,

130
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:51,006
and at about 20 meters or so
from the object, we'll stop.

131
00:08:51,006 --> 00:08:53,089
We'll stay in a station keeping,

132
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:57,563
so very close approach
and station-keeping phase

133
00:08:57,563 --> 00:09:04,103
and station, where we will take
a lot of videos from SwissCube.

134
00:09:04,103 --> 00:09:07,773
The intent here will be
to reconstruct its motion,

135
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:12,583
to check its integrity,
and reconstruct its motion.

136
00:09:14,096 --> 00:09:18,376
Once we have that,
we will be able to determine

137
00:09:18,376 --> 00:09:20,797
where CleanSpace One
needs to position itself

138
00:09:20,797 --> 00:09:24,507
with respect to SwissCube
in order to maximize

139
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:26,425
the chances of capturing it.

140
00:09:26,757 --> 00:09:30,720
And of course, we will do
all of these maneuvers

141
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,040
and get to the capture phase.

142
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:37,260
And the capture phase in itself
will be also a challenge

143
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:40,999
because again, this object,
SwissCube, is non-cooperative.

144
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,349
It will be rotating.

145
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,786
There are two long antennas

146
00:09:45,786 --> 00:09:48,472
and the capture system will have to deal

147
00:09:48,472 --> 00:09:50,920
with these antennas moving around.

148
00:09:51,252 --> 00:09:54,282
The actual capture system
that we have chosen,

149
00:09:54,282 --> 00:09:59,012
the Pac-Man concept,
allows to do this capture

150
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:00,992
hopefully in a very safe way.

151
00:10:11,259 --> 00:10:15,739
In fact, the challenges
of the CleanSpace One mission

152
00:10:15,739 --> 00:10:21,009
are challenges that are related
to active debris removal in general,

153
00:10:21,009 --> 00:10:26,445
meaning the approach and operations

154
00:10:26,445 --> 00:10:29,299
with an object
which is not cooperative.

155
00:10:29,991 --> 00:10:32,511
This object is not giving us a response,

156
00:10:32,511 --> 00:10:35,281
if we ask him how far we are.

157
00:10:35,283 --> 00:10:40,023
It doesn't have
any nicely placed features on it

158
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:42,824
that we can track
during the rotations.

159
00:10:42,824 --> 00:10:47,564
So all of these technologies
need to be further advanced,

160
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:50,324
and represent the challenges
of the capture.

161
00:10:50,324 --> 00:10:54,974
The capture for CleanSpace One
will be not as demanding

162
00:10:54,974 --> 00:10:57,543
as the capture for very large objects

163
00:10:57,543 --> 00:10:59,753
because SwissCube is a kilogram.

164
00:10:59,753 --> 00:11:01,523
CleanSpace One will be bigger.

165
00:11:01,523 --> 00:11:04,293
So in terms of ratios of inertias,

166
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:08,023
it will be simpler than
capturing a very big obect.

167
00:11:16,856 --> 00:11:20,276
One of the implications of this work,

168
00:11:20,276 --> 00:11:22,821
which is not specific to us,

169
00:11:24,028 --> 00:11:27,442
and the whole space community
is aware of it

170
00:11:27,442 --> 00:11:33,026
is since it's hard to rendezvous
and capture an uncooperative object,

171
00:11:33,026 --> 00:11:38,200
the question is, can we create
the new satellites

172
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,486
with hardware that would
help potentially

173
00:11:42,486 --> 00:11:46,966
being picked up by a remover
satellite in the future.

174
00:11:46,966 --> 00:11:51,756
So this is an activity
that is going on currently at ESA,

175
00:11:51,756 --> 00:11:56,716
which is design-for-demise
and design-for-removal,

176
00:11:56,716 --> 00:12:02,026
such that those techniques
and processes will be applied

177
00:12:02,026 --> 00:12:04,721
for future satellites,
such that they are,

178
00:12:04,721 --> 00:12:07,774
either when they come down
in the atmosphere,

179
00:12:07,774 --> 00:12:10,014
they break up more easily,

180
00:12:10,014 --> 00:12:15,504
such you don't have as many
possibilities of pieces of the satellite

181
00:12:15,504 --> 00:12:17,631
to be found on the ground.

182
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:21,041
Or to actually have
hardware on satellites

183
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:24,991
such that at the end of life,
if they cannot for some reason

184
00:12:24,991 --> 00:12:27,231
come back down by themselves,

185
00:12:27,231 --> 00:12:32,541
then they would be easily picked up
by remover satellites.

186
00:12:33,217 --> 00:12:39,527
And maybe I can open up
even more the realm of possibilities

187
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:42,307
but one thing we could think of,

188
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:46,507
and you as a student
may want to start thinking of is

189
00:12:46,507 --> 00:12:52,511
instead of going up there to remove
and take big satellites

190
00:12:52,511 --> 00:12:56,791
that have quite large masses, in fact,

191
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:59,568
and bring them down to the Earth,

192
00:12:59,568 --> 00:13:04,261
wouldn't the next step be
to actually put them

193
00:13:04,261 --> 00:13:08,524
and gather them
in a large space station

194
00:13:08,524 --> 00:13:12,042
and use the materials
and recycle these materials

195
00:13:12,042 --> 00:13:14,272
in this very large space station

196
00:13:14,272 --> 00:13:16,992
such that the material
doesn't have to come down

197
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:19,002
and then be launched again.

198
00:13:19,002 --> 00:13:23,002
But it's what I would call
the recycling of these debris

199
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:28,012
and the creation of new satellites
from the recycling

200
00:13:28,012 --> 00:13:29,265
that you found.

201
00:13:29,265 --> 00:13:32,325
And those are topics
that you may want to investigate

202
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:35,755
and start thinking about
and see how costly it would be

203
00:13:35,755 --> 00:13:40,505
to have such a recycling center in space.

204
00:13:47,257 --> 00:13:49,507
A couple of years ago,
we approached ESA

205
00:13:49,507 --> 00:13:53,257
with an activity which was
actually very welcomed,

206
00:13:53,257 --> 00:13:58,492
which was to look at
how we could reduce the risk

207
00:13:58,492 --> 00:14:04,022
of these very large missions
to remove very large debris

208
00:14:04,022 --> 00:14:06,764
by in-orbit demonstrations.

209
00:14:06,764 --> 00:14:10,794
And these in-orbit demonstrations
could be done with CubeSats.

210
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:14,727
CubeSats are very small satellites.

211
00:14:14,727 --> 00:14:17,857
We call those pico- or nano-satellites.

212
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:22,021
They go from one to about
ten kilograms or so,

213
00:14:22,021 --> 00:14:23,550
eight, ten kilograms.

214
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,757
And the idea is that you could use

215
00:14:26,757 --> 00:14:33,662
those very small cost-effective satellites
to make very specific demonstrations

216
00:14:33,662 --> 00:14:38,281
before flying those technologies
into the very large mission.

217
00:14:38,281 --> 00:14:43,123
And this way, you alleviate
some of the risks that are taken

218
00:14:43,123 --> 00:14:45,019
by these very large missions.

219
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:51,009
So we proposed two scenarios
to ESA using CubeSats.

220
00:14:51,714 --> 00:14:54,744
One was to test rendezvous sensors,

221
00:14:54,744 --> 00:14:57,554
so these uncooperative
rendezvous sensors,

222
00:14:57,554 --> 00:15:03,534
and the other one was to test
the capture system called The Net.

223
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:08,304
That's where you launch a net
and the net grabs an object

224
00:15:08,304 --> 00:15:10,974
or folds around an object.

225
00:15:10,974 --> 00:15:17,354
And with ESA I was particularly interested
in the in-orbit demonstration

226
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:21,904
of the non-cooperative rendezvous sensors.

227
00:15:22,531 --> 00:15:29,075
Also as a way to the risk
and a way to test some of the algorithms

228
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:32,542
that we'll need for the image processing.

229
00:15:33,743 --> 00:15:36,493
So this mission we called CADRE,

230
00:15:36,493 --> 00:15:40,032
for CubeSat, ADR, Experiment. [ADR=Active Debris Removal]

231
00:15:40,032 --> 00:15:45,042
And CADRE will have two CubeSats.

232
00:15:45,042 --> 00:15:49,252
One, an eight-unit CubeSat,
which was about eight kilograms,

233
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:53,032
and then the other one,
a four-unit CubeSat,

234
00:15:53,032 --> 00:15:55,002
which was about four kilograms.

235
00:15:55,002 --> 00:15:59,782
And the idea was to actually
have them launched attached,

236
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,809
sent to space,
do the commissioning phase,

237
00:16:03,809 --> 00:16:05,269
after the commissioning phase,

238
00:16:05,269 --> 00:16:08,529
do a release and detachment
between the two,

239
00:16:08,529 --> 00:16:11,299
and have then the eight-unit CubeSat

240
00:16:11,299 --> 00:16:14,760
perform maneuvers around the debris

241
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,770
and having the capability
of the four-unit CubeSat

242
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:21,510
to start making rotations,
which we would know.

243
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:26,779
So that would basically validate
some of the algorithms

244
00:16:26,779 --> 00:16:32,856
and all the GNC, the Guidance
Navigation Control, algorithms

245
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:38,531
that would be required
for doing all these maneuvers.

246
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:44,801
So this CADRE mission is something
that we're trying to continue working on,

247
00:16:44,801 --> 00:16:49,541
and the spirit is there to miniaturize
rendezvous sensors,

248
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:52,745
make them potentially
more cost-effective,

249
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,781
and demonstrate them
in space via CubeSats.

250
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:07,497
In fact, the most interesting debris

251
00:17:07,497 --> 00:17:13,057
to be picked up from space
are very large debris.

252
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:16,537
Why's that? Because they typically
have a very large mass,

253
00:17:16,537 --> 00:17:19,277
a very large cross-section area,

254
00:17:19,277 --> 00:17:24,207
and so the probability
of a collision is the greatest

255
00:17:24,207 --> 00:17:27,295
and the probability of creating
many, many more debris

256
00:17:27,295 --> 00:17:28,545
are the greatest.

257
00:17:28,545 --> 00:17:32,305
There have been studies
between NASA, ESA

258
00:17:32,305 --> 00:17:35,845
and papers published on this topic

259
00:17:36,535 --> 00:17:41,778
which show which are
the 500 most wanted debris.

260
00:17:41,778 --> 00:17:45,497
And they typically show
old rocket bodies

261
00:17:45,497 --> 00:17:49,269
as debris of interest,

262
00:17:49,269 --> 00:17:52,049
and also very large
and defunct satellites.

263
00:17:52,745 --> 00:17:58,255
Currently, the European
Space Agency has a program

264
00:17:58,255 --> 00:18:03,785
dedicated to the removal
of one of these large debris

265
00:18:03,785 --> 00:18:08,721
also as a demonstration
and as a technology development.

266
00:18:09,228 --> 00:18:13,108
So this initiative is called
the CleanSpace Initiative

267
00:18:13,108 --> 00:18:17,775
and the mission associated
with that initiative is called e.Deorbit.

268
00:18:17,775 --> 00:18:20,788
And so we do refer you
to the ESA website

269
00:18:20,788 --> 00:18:23,288
to get more in the details of it.

270
00:18:23,288 --> 00:18:26,798
But here ESA is addressing
the right question,

271
00:18:26,798 --> 00:18:30,508
which is, how do we actually
go ahead and remove debris

272
00:18:30,508 --> 00:18:35,528
that are between two, four,
eight tonne debris

273
00:18:35,528 --> 00:18:38,528
and that can be very large?

274
00:18:38,528 --> 00:18:41,194
So again, 20 meters long.

275
00:18:41,568 --> 00:18:45,753
Those debris will be
most of the time spinning,

276
00:18:45,753 --> 00:18:47,934
hopefully not too fast.

277
00:18:47,934 --> 00:18:49,714
So how do you do this capture?

278
00:18:49,714 --> 00:18:55,354
How do you make sure
that you reliably grab

279
00:18:55,354 --> 00:18:59,774
and bring back down to the Earth
in a controlled manner

280
00:18:59,774 --> 00:19:01,514
such very large debris?

281
00:19:01,514 --> 00:19:03,784
Those are great challenges.

282
00:19:11,965 --> 00:19:17,725
Removal of large debris has its own
set of technical challenges

283
00:19:17,725 --> 00:19:23,565
but in fact it also has its own
set of political and ethical issues.

284
00:19:24,739 --> 00:19:28,369
The first question
that we can ask ourselves is,

285
00:19:28,369 --> 00:19:31,526
to whom do the debris belong?

286
00:19:31,526 --> 00:19:34,788
Those debris may have
been there for 20 years.

287
00:19:35,776 --> 00:19:37,406
Who do they belong to?

288
00:19:37,406 --> 00:19:40,756
And who is going to claim
property of them?

289
00:19:40,756 --> 00:19:44,556
So all issues related to
their identification

290
00:19:46,106 --> 00:19:49,208
are things that are of concern.

291
00:19:49,939 --> 00:19:53,868
Another part which is the legal frame

292
00:19:53,868 --> 00:19:59,277
that should be associated
with orbital debris.

293
00:19:59,791 --> 00:20:06,961
For instance, in the previous case
we had Cosmos enter into collision

294
00:20:06,961 --> 00:20:11,971
with a currently functional
and operational Iridium satellite.

295
00:20:11,971 --> 00:20:14,151
You know, who's at fault?

296
00:20:15,523 --> 00:20:18,263
Who should be responsible for it?

297
00:20:18,263 --> 00:20:22,249
So all these legal frames
into, if there's a collision,

298
00:20:22,249 --> 00:20:23,979
who is responsible for it?

299
00:20:23,979 --> 00:20:30,499
But also the legal frame
of how should nations

300
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:33,286
that are sending satellites up there,

301
00:20:33,286 --> 00:20:38,276
how should they react
and make sure within their country

302
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:42,796
that laws are applied to make
sure that future launches

303
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:46,551
respect the regulations?

304
00:20:46,551 --> 00:20:50,563
So there are UN regulations

305
00:20:50,563 --> 00:20:54,278
from the Committee
on the Peaceful Use of Outer Space,

306
00:20:54,278 --> 00:20:57,758
the COPUOS, and there are
lots of COPUOS currently

307
00:20:57,758 --> 00:21:00,668
activities in that domain,

308
00:21:00,668 --> 00:21:06,548
which is how to make sure
that countries take responsibility.

309
00:21:06,548 --> 00:21:10,528
Potentially, countries create
their own internal laws

310
00:21:10,528 --> 00:21:16,493
that will increase the probability
of all the satellites

311
00:21:16,493 --> 00:21:18,869
that we send to be brought back.

312
00:21:18,869 --> 00:21:22,071
So these are legal issues.

313
00:21:22,071 --> 00:21:27,010
There are other issues
such as the funding.

314
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:30,984
Who is actually going to fund
active debris removal?

315
00:21:31,641 --> 00:21:36,964
We do need to remove about 500 debris
in the next 10 to 20 years.

316
00:21:36,964 --> 00:21:38,779
Who is going to fund this?

317
00:21:38,779 --> 00:21:43,009
What are the mechanisms
that we should put in place

318
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:46,048
in order to do this fundraising?

319
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:48,294
And there are several options for it

320
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:51,402
but none of them are yet very clear.

321
00:21:52,274 --> 00:21:59,215
And finally, maybe a less obvious
political aspect is that, in fact,

322
00:21:59,215 --> 00:22:04,251
if you create a chaser satellite,
so a debris remover satellite,

323
00:22:04,251 --> 00:22:07,475
you actually have
all the technologies in place

324
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:10,796
to remove somebody else's satellite,

325
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,786
so some other country's
operational satellite.

326
00:22:13,786 --> 00:22:18,516
And so there are military aspects
to these technologies

327
00:22:18,516 --> 00:22:20,777
that are significant.

328
00:22:20,777 --> 00:22:24,041
So these are political challenges

329
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,491
and there are lots of meetings about this

330
00:22:26,491 --> 00:22:29,253
in the United Nations currently.

331
00:22:30,231 --> 00:22:33,245
Most of the nations
are very aware of the problem,

332
00:22:33,245 --> 00:22:38,969
which was not as much the case
four, five, six years ago.

333
00:22:39,303 --> 00:22:43,763
So we have been seeing
a lot of increase in the awareness

334
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:49,043
and political responsibility
for this problem, which is great.

335
00:22:56,348 --> 00:23:02,508
So I got fascinated by space
when I was 12 years old

336
00:23:02,508 --> 00:23:07,267
when I saw my first astronomy
pictures of galaxies and so on.

337
00:23:07,267 --> 00:23:10,950
And so from that point on,

338
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,950
I knew that I wanted to work in
a space related field.

339
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:18,950
And by making different choices
of the schools I could go to

340
00:23:18,950 --> 00:23:21,300
and the options I could take,

341
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:26,490
I ended up working first
in interplanetary missions

342
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:31,760
and exploration of outer planets
and inner planet,

343
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,285
and now into the field
of smaller satellites.

344
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:41,792
So it was a passion
that drove me all along

345
00:23:41,792 --> 00:23:45,522
that was started at 12 years old,

346
00:23:45,522 --> 00:23:47,529
and it hasn't left me.

347
00:23:55,501 --> 00:23:59,011
The studies that I did
and the choice I made

348
00:23:59,011 --> 00:24:03,011
into which schools to go to
were driven by the fact

349
00:24:03,011 --> 00:24:08,981
that I wanted to learn about
space vehicles, launch vehicles,

350
00:24:08,981 --> 00:24:11,521
and then after that, spacecraft.

351
00:24:11,521 --> 00:24:17,111
I did the basic engineering schools
and at the Bachelor level,

352
00:24:17,111 --> 00:24:20,271
and then I got specialized
and during my Masters

353
00:24:20,271 --> 00:24:23,781
into Aerospace I ended up also working.

354
00:24:25,062 --> 00:24:27,032
At the same time
I could do my studies,

355
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:30,992
which really helped
with getting experience,

356
00:24:30,992 --> 00:24:35,763
hands-on experience
on the space missions.

357
00:24:35,763 --> 00:24:40,833
And then I found that in fact,
I was very interested,

358
00:24:40,833 --> 00:24:45,953
not in particular subsystems,
sub elements of the satellite,

359
00:24:45,953 --> 00:24:50,733
but I was really interested
into the interconnections

360
00:24:50,733 --> 00:24:52,997
that each subsystem had

361
00:24:52,997 --> 00:24:57,807
and how one subsystem
could influence another.

362
00:24:57,807 --> 00:25:01,557
And that's basically
called Systems Engineering.

363
00:25:01,557 --> 00:25:05,777
So this is how as I went along,

364
00:25:05,777 --> 00:25:10,072
I got involved more and more
into understanding

365
00:25:10,072 --> 00:25:12,550
the implications
of the missions

366
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:15,300
and the mission design
into the system

367
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,560
and then the trade-offs
that you can have

368
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,990
between the different subsystems

369
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:22,118
when you actually build the satellite.

370
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:27,044
So the system engineer is like
the chief of an orchestra

371
00:25:27,044 --> 00:25:28,990
where you need, in the end,

372
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,530
when you have a complex system,

373
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:35,280
you need to have somebody
that can defend

374
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:38,338
and see the interest of one person

375
00:25:38,338 --> 00:25:40,798
and make sure that that subsystem

376
00:25:42,747 --> 00:25:45,397
has all the information
it needs to do its job

377
00:25:45,397 --> 00:25:51,127
and ensure the coherency of the design
at the system level.

378
00:25:51,127 --> 00:25:55,957
So it's very much
a coordinator, also, job.

379
00:25:56,685 --> 00:25:58,275
So I got very interested by that.

380
00:25:58,275 --> 00:26:02,495
I think it's coming more
from my nature than anything else.
