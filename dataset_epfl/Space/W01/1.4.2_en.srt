1
00:00:05,213 --> 00:00:06,420
The Sun is a star,

2
00:00:06,692 --> 00:00:10,370
but it's a star that doesn't always have
the same appearance;

3
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:12,071
it has variations.

4
00:00:12,071 --> 00:00:14,229
In fact, it's a variable star,

5
00:00:14,229 --> 00:00:18,439
in its appearance on the one hand
and also in its radiation,

6
00:00:18,445 --> 00:00:21,981
in various parts 
of the electromagnetic spectrum.

7
00:00:22,471 --> 00:00:25,307
Here we see a view of the Sun.

8
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:28,535
In the visible part of the light,

9
00:00:28,535 --> 00:00:31,490
you see sunspots which have been
observed for a long time already.

10
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:34,664
In fact, we already have a recording
of the number of sunspots

11
00:00:34,664 --> 00:00:36,840
since the end of the 18th century,

12
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,205
which is quite interesting 
because we have seen over the centuries

13
00:00:40,205 --> 00:00:42,252
how the Sun has varied.

14
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:46,122
Here you see a group of sunspots, 
quite large sunspots,

15
00:00:46,606 --> 00:00:48,880
here a small group, up there.

16
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:53,931
And what is interesting
is that the sunspot number

17
00:00:54,834 --> 00:00:57,529
is a value that changes with time,

18
00:00:57,529 --> 00:01:00,400
with a period of approximately 11 years.

19
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,718
It's the so-called "solar cycle",

20
00:01:02,718 --> 00:01:05,039
which traditionally has been determined

21
00:01:05,039 --> 00:01:07,309
on the basis of the number of sunspots.

22
00:01:07,309 --> 00:01:09,122
What is also interesting is

23
00:01:09,122 --> 00:01:12,192
that the latitude of the sunspots varies

24
00:01:12,192 --> 00:01:15,553
depending on where we are
in the solar cycle.

25
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:17,790
In fact, at the solar minimum

26
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,633
the latitude is relatively high:
about 25, 30 degrees,

27
00:01:20,633 --> 00:01:22,753
and then it goes down

28
00:01:23,471 --> 00:01:25,845
as we approach the solar maximum.

29
00:01:25,845 --> 00:01:28,823
So this would correspond to the minimum,

30
00:01:28,823 --> 00:01:30,683
and a variation toward lower latitude

31
00:01:30,683 --> 00:01:32,004
for the solar maximum.

32
00:01:32,644 --> 00:01:37,695
This is a depiction of the solar cycle 
from 1979 until 2040,

33
00:01:37,999 --> 00:01:41,749
and the solar cycles are depicted 
as 21 through 26.

34
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,617
We had sunspots respectively

35
00:01:44,617 --> 00:01:47,760
solar cycle maximum 1979,

36
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:52,724
and you see that there is a decrease

37
00:01:52,724 --> 00:01:55,931
in the activity of the sun 
relating to the number of sunspots

38
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:58,394
within about six years.

39
00:01:58,394 --> 00:02:00,725
Then we have an increase 
in about five years,

40
00:02:00,725 --> 00:02:02,557
and a decrease in about six years,

41
00:02:02,559 --> 00:02:05,936
then another increase in five years.

42
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:07,847
So it's not perfectly symmetric,

43
00:02:07,847 --> 00:02:09,837
the decrease and the increase.

44
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:12,326
You see that at the present time

45
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:16,552
we are in solar cycle 24 in 2015,

46
00:02:16,552 --> 00:02:19,803
when this course was recorded,

47
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:25,732
and we are expecting
a solar sunspot minimum in 2018.

48
00:02:26,554 --> 00:02:29,250
And it will be followed by cycle 25.

49
00:02:30,042 --> 00:02:33,224
Obviously, the number of sunspots

50
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:37,370
cannot always be determined 
in a very precise manner,

51
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,867
because if you have a very small sunspot,

52
00:02:39,867 --> 00:02:41,962
are you going to count it or not?

53
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:45,603
So there's a better way now

54
00:02:45,603 --> 00:02:47,889
to determine where we are
in the solar cycle

55
00:02:48,631 --> 00:02:50,419
and see what is the intensity

56
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:53,039
of the minimum and the maximum
of the solar cycle.

57
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,754
In fact, what has been done recently

58
00:02:55,754 --> 00:02:58,116
is the radio flux:

59
00:02:58,116 --> 00:03:00,696
at the wavelength of 10.7 cm

60
00:03:00,696 --> 00:03:04,903
there's a hydrogen line
whose intensities are varying

61
00:03:04,903 --> 00:03:07,053
depending on where we are
on the solar cycle,

62
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:10,538
and you can see on this graph

63
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:15,894
correlation between 
the flux intensity of 10.7 cm

64
00:03:15,903 --> 00:03:17,957
in the spectrum of the Sun,

65
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:20,256
versus the sunspot number,

66
00:03:20,256 --> 00:03:23,754
which is depicted on the right-hand side.

67
00:03:24,478 --> 00:03:26,323
So there's a very good correlation.

68
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:29,026
Again, this is quantitatively
a much better way

69
00:03:29,026 --> 00:03:31,405
to determine where we are
on the solar cycle.

70
00:03:32,384 --> 00:03:35,775
Now, it's very important 
to know where we are

71
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:39,496
on the solar cycle, 
because depending on where we are

72
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:41,609
there's a significant effect

73
00:03:41,609 --> 00:03:43,789
on the thickness of the atmosphere;

74
00:03:43,789 --> 00:03:47,678
respectively on the density 
of the atmosphere

75
00:03:47,678 --> 00:03:49,372
at a given altitude.

76
00:03:49,372 --> 00:03:50,792
Let's take 500 km.

77
00:03:52,082 --> 00:03:55,033
You see that if we are at a solar minimum

78
00:03:55,033 --> 00:03:57,930
this is the density that we have.

79
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,111
You can see this on the vertical scale.

80
00:04:00,929 --> 00:04:02,911
On a solar maximum, you see that

81
00:04:02,911 --> 00:04:05,603
the density can vary
versus the solar minimum,

82
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:08,534
with one or even two 
orders of magnitude.

83
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,079
Now the scale that you see for the F10.7,

84
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:17,902
the flux, or irradiance, 
at the 10.7 cm hydrogen line,

85
00:04:18,562 --> 00:04:20,462
doesn't have the same values

86
00:04:20,462 --> 00:04:22,286
as we have seen on the previous graph.

87
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:25,116
But it doesn't matter: 
the main thing is, you see clearly

88
00:04:25,116 --> 00:04:27,500
where the solar maximum 
and solar minimum is,

89
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,525
and the significant effect,

90
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:33,561
especially for the altitude
between 500 and 1,000 kilometers

91
00:04:33,561 --> 00:04:35,476
above the earth's surface.

92
00:04:35,476 --> 00:04:38,335
The effect on the density 
of the atmosphere.

93
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:41,586
Obviously, you can imagine
that this will have an effect,

94
00:04:41,586 --> 00:04:43,258
and we'll cover this later,

95
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:44,843
on the lifetime of satellites.

96
00:04:44,843 --> 00:04:46,923
If you are at a solar maximum,

97
00:04:46,923 --> 00:04:49,391
you have for a given altitude
a high density,

98
00:04:49,391 --> 00:04:51,106
which means you have more drag,

99
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:53,738
and you have a diminished 
lifetime for satellites.
