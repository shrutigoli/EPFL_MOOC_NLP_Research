1
00:00:06,109 --> 00:00:10,386
In this section, we'll talk about
particle flux in the Earth environment,

2
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:14,234
and the effect on the electronic system
which can be significant,

3
00:00:14,234 --> 00:00:17,304
and also on human beings,
which is of course,

4
00:00:17,304 --> 00:00:20,585
a very important feature
for human space flight,

5
00:00:20,585 --> 00:00:24,121
being on Low Earth Orbit
or in the solar system.

6
00:00:24,121 --> 00:00:29,086
First of all, we look at the solar 
particle flux observed on Earth,

7
00:00:29,086 --> 00:00:31,227
following a coronal mass ejection

8
00:00:31,227 --> 00:00:35,026
that we've seen on the SOHO pictures
that these are frequent,

9
00:00:35,026 --> 00:00:36,434
they are high energy,

10
00:00:36,434 --> 00:00:39,454
and there is an enormous amount
of charged particles

11
00:00:39,454 --> 00:00:42,072
that flow through the Solar System
all the way to the Earth,

12
00:00:42,072 --> 00:00:44,152
following the CMEs.

13
00:00:44,152 --> 00:00:48,912
And first of all, we have X-rays
rather high energy X-rays.

14
00:00:48,912 --> 00:00:52,872
Of course, they come
eight minutes or later,

15
00:00:52,872 --> 00:00:54,670
after the event itself,

16
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:58,406
because that's the time
that electromagnetic radiation takes

17
00:00:58,406 --> 00:01:00,767
to come from the Sun
all the way to the Earth.

18
00:01:01,397 --> 00:01:07,067
Then, we have a pretty high amount
of high energy protons

19
00:01:07,067 --> 00:01:09,130
modified in mega electronvolts.

20
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:14,881
We have a burst of these coming
a little less than an hour after the CME,

21
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:18,399
followed a little later
by lower energy protons,

22
00:01:18,399 --> 00:01:24,723
but a large flux of these 
lower energy protons

23
00:01:24,723 --> 00:01:27,098
and they will extend all the way through,

24
00:01:28,178 --> 00:01:31,250
about one week,
or even more than one week,

25
00:01:31,250 --> 00:01:32,773
following the CME.

26
00:01:34,043 --> 00:01:38,812
Now, in addition to particles
coming from the Sun,

27
00:01:38,812 --> 00:01:40,162
in the solar wind,

28
00:01:40,162 --> 00:01:43,091
and when we have
CMEs, a coronal mass ejections,

29
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:44,645
you have galactic cosmic rays

30
00:01:44,645 --> 00:01:46,480
and these can be quite energetic.

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,675
Typically, we have ionized nuclei,

32
00:01:49,675 --> 00:01:55,004
and they get also trapped
in the inner and the outer radiation belts.

33
00:01:57,234 --> 00:02:02,507
Single-event effects are the effects
on the electronic system.

34
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:06,241
It affects the digital devices, obviously.

35
00:02:07,191 --> 00:02:10,137
We have to imagine
these high energy particles

36
00:02:10,137 --> 00:02:12,671
that travel through semiconductors,

37
00:02:12,671 --> 00:02:14,583
and they leave an ionized track behind,

38
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:17,471
and that can cause damage
to electronic systems.

39
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:21,137
Normally, the SEEs are not that bad.

40
00:02:21,137 --> 00:02:24,638
When you have a high energy particle
coming to an electronic system,

41
00:02:24,638 --> 00:02:27,512
you can have a SEU,
or a Single-Event Upset,

42
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:30,353
or even a Single-Event Latchup, SEL,

43
00:02:30,353 --> 00:02:34,136
that can cause a total fatal damage
to an electronic system.

44
00:02:34,136 --> 00:02:37,126
Now, there are techniques
for hardening of electronic systems

45
00:02:37,126 --> 00:02:38,628
to make them less susceptible

46
00:02:38,628 --> 00:02:41,622
to the impact of high energy particles,

47
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:44,592
and this is, by itself, a total science

48
00:02:44,592 --> 00:02:48,461
and an important engineering feature
for space flights,

49
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:50,665
and this will be covered
in other parts of the course,

50
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:53,491
and in other courses in these series.

51
00:02:54,657 --> 00:02:57,101
Let's talk about
this South Atlantic Anomaly.

52
00:02:57,101 --> 00:03:01,212
You have the Earth, and you have
the rotational axis of the Earth,

53
00:03:01,212 --> 00:03:04,179
and the line between the magnetic poles

54
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,595
is not collocated with the rotational axis
of the Earth.

55
00:03:08,595 --> 00:03:11,022
The magnetic poles are
the regions of the Earth

56
00:03:11,022 --> 00:03:14,221
where the magnetic field lines
are near vertical,

57
00:03:14,531 --> 00:03:18,434
so you have this geometry

58
00:03:18,434 --> 00:03:24,543
of the Van Allen belts,

59
00:03:24,991 --> 00:03:28,232
that differs from the geometry
of the Earth itself,

60
00:03:28,232 --> 00:03:31,677
as a celestial body
with the equator and a rotational axis.

61
00:03:31,677 --> 00:03:33,740
Another feature
which is quite interesting

62
00:03:33,740 --> 00:03:37,568
is that the local magnetic field
of the Earth

63
00:03:38,568 --> 00:03:42,745
is as if it was produced by magnets
not collocated

64
00:03:42,745 --> 00:03:45,833
with the center of the Earth itself,
but somewhat displaced.

65
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:49,282
And you can see this on this picture
where you have

66
00:03:49,282 --> 00:03:51,980
the inner radiation belt in this area,

67
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:56,340
this is the area south of Rio de Janeiro
and the South Atlantic,

68
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,268
which is closer to the Earth's surface
than on the other side,

69
00:03:59,268 --> 00:04:01,925
in the area of Singapore,

70
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:04,712
approximately, the other side
of the Earth

71
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:09,472
which means, that on an orbit
of 500-600 kilometers altitude,

72
00:04:09,472 --> 00:04:11,110
you are going to penetrate

73
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:15,687
in the lower boundary
of the inner radiation belt,

74
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:17,200
at a lower latitude,

75
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,602
and you are going to have
a higher flux of particles,

76
00:04:19,602 --> 00:04:22,983
on such an orbit, in this area,
south of Rio,

77
00:04:22,983 --> 00:04:25,067
than you have on the other side.

78
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,844
I personally experienced this
on the first servicing mission of Hubble,

79
00:04:27,844 --> 00:04:29,548
which is at 600 kilometers altitude

80
00:04:29,548 --> 00:04:32,881
and by night, every time
we're passing through

81
00:04:32,881 --> 00:04:34,511
the South Atlantic Anomaly,

82
00:04:34,511 --> 00:04:38,673
in the south of Rio de Janeiro,
in Sao Paolo, in Brazil,

83
00:04:39,050 --> 00:04:41,227
then, we had sometimes flashes
in our eyes,

84
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:45,848
that were the proof that 
we had a high energy particle,

85
00:04:45,848 --> 00:04:48,712
penetrating into our ocular globes

86
00:04:48,712 --> 00:04:51,234
and producing these flashes

87
00:04:51,234 --> 00:04:55,144
due to so-called Bremsstrahlung
in the eyes.

88
00:04:56,584 --> 00:04:58,997
Here you have the representation
of the location

89
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:00,687
of the South Atlantic Anomaly,

90
00:05:00,687 --> 00:05:03,247
and again, whenever you are
with the spacecraft

91
00:05:03,247 --> 00:05:05,964
at a few hundred kilometers
above the Earth surface,

92
00:05:05,964 --> 00:05:07,288
passing this area,

93
00:05:07,288 --> 00:05:09,224
then you have a higher flux of particles,

94
00:05:09,224 --> 00:05:12,028
and you have also, of course,
physiological effects

95
00:05:12,028 --> 00:05:14,340
that are more pronounced
crossing these areas,

96
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,884
than in other areas
on orbit around the Earth.

97
00:05:19,246 --> 00:05:23,555
Now, some definitions and expressions
about the radiation,

98
00:05:23,995 --> 00:05:26,668
and also, the physiological effect
of this radiation:

99
00:05:26,668 --> 00:05:29,890
on top, you have the RAD,
Radiation Absorbed Dose.

100
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:34,361
This is the amount of energy absorbed
by the influx of particles,

101
00:05:34,361 --> 00:05:38,883
and a RAD is 0.01 J/kg,

102
00:05:38,883 --> 00:05:42,753
or 100 erg/g of material.

103
00:05:42,753 --> 00:05:48,871
Now, the REM, the Roentgen Equivalent Man,
is at times, a quality factor,

104
00:05:48,871 --> 00:05:54,077
that depends on the type of particle
impacting the biological material.

105
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:57,784
And on the third bullet
you have the quality factor

106
00:05:57,784 --> 00:06:00,921
for different kinds
of radiation, for instance;

107
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:04,905
for X-ray, gamma ray, electrons,
and beta is a factor one.

108
00:06:04,905 --> 00:06:09,635
Between two and 20 neutrons and alphas,
which are helium nuclei,

109
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,737
two protons, two neutrons,
it's about 20 also.

110
00:06:12,737 --> 00:06:17,575
And it can be more for iron ions.

111
00:06:19,425 --> 00:06:23,180
The biological effect that impact
a particle on a biological material

112
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:25,837
depends on the type
of particle, obviously.

113
00:06:25,837 --> 00:06:28,100
An iron nucleus
will have a much larger effect

114
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,676
than a proton.

115
00:06:30,176 --> 00:06:34,977
And another unit used
in this respect is Sievert, Sv,

116
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:37,475
is equal to 100 REM.

117
00:06:39,155 --> 00:06:42,441
On this table,
we have the physiological effect

118
00:06:42,441 --> 00:06:45,223
of radiation and typical doses.

119
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:47,333
We try, you see, on top,

120
00:06:47,333 --> 00:06:54,121
we try to always stay
below 100 REM, or one Sievert,

121
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:57,070
because this is
vomiting effective threshold.

122
00:06:57,070 --> 00:07:03,944
As long as you are in the area
between 5 and 10, maybe 20 REMs,

123
00:07:03,944 --> 00:07:05,472
you are okay.

124
00:07:05,472 --> 00:07:08,801
If you go toward 100,
that's when you start to have problems,

125
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:11,478
and obviously, if you have large values,
above 500,

126
00:07:12,568 --> 00:07:15,520
then you have
significant medical problems.

127
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:18,795
And you have,
in the lower part of this table,

128
00:07:18,795 --> 00:07:23,328
the effect for different situations
including a typical Shuttle mission,

129
00:07:23,328 --> 00:07:27,561
where you had normally,
a total or less than one REM.

130
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:30,583
As long as you are on Low Earth Orbit,

131
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,829
including the International Space Station,

132
00:07:32,829 --> 00:07:34,407
the radiation is not very, very high,

133
00:07:34,407 --> 00:07:38,345
because you are protected,
on one hand, by the magnetosphere,

134
00:07:38,345 --> 00:07:41,300
and by the atmosphere
that is remaining above you.

135
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:44,006
Remember that at 400 kilometers altitude,

136
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:47,076
this is the altitude of the orbit of
the International Space Station,

137
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:48,675
you are in the ionosphere,

138
00:07:48,675 --> 00:07:51,343
you still have a portion
of the ionosphere above you,

139
00:07:51,343 --> 00:07:54,849
which causes an absorption
of the particles,

140
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:57,683
whether they come from the Sun
or from the Galaxy.

141
00:07:59,183 --> 00:08:02,570
Here we have the radiation exposure
for various activities.

142
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,898
The annual cosmic radiation
at sea level, you see, is very low,

143
00:08:08,898 --> 00:08:12,074
is less than one milliSievert.

144
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:18,539
And the graph goes all the way
to 500 days on the surface of Mars,

145
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:25,281
where you have less
that 1,000 milliSievert, or one Sievert,

146
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:29,193
and remember, this is
the equivalent of 100 REM.

147
00:08:29,193 --> 00:08:32,072
So this is a limit that you never, 
never want to exceed.

148
00:08:32,072 --> 00:08:35,160
So obviously, a long stay
on the surface of Mars

149
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:39,067
will cause, not an insignificant amount
of radiation on the body,

150
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:43,823
and measures have to be taken
to protect the astronaut on Mars,

151
00:08:43,823 --> 00:08:45,995
during their trip
toward the red planet,

152
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:48,584
or when they are spending time
over there,

153
00:08:48,584 --> 00:08:49,967
to be protected against radiation,

154
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:53,307
typically on having habitation
under the surface of Mars.
