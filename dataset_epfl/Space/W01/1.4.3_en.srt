1
00:00:05,073 --> 00:00:07,443
The Sun is an active star.

2
00:00:07,443 --> 00:00:12,207
In addition to the 11-year cycle
that we talked about before

3
00:00:12,207 --> 00:00:16,367
with the change in the number
of sunspots under a sunspot group

4
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:18,262
over a period of 11 years,

5
00:00:18,262 --> 00:00:25,130
we have on one hand turbulence
in most of the surface of the Sun,

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:29,336
so we have a granularity
of the surface of the Sun.

7
00:00:29,336 --> 00:00:31,358
We have the sunspots,
I mentioned that.

8
00:00:31,358 --> 00:00:35,052
And we also have flares
and coronal mass ejections.

9
00:00:35,052 --> 00:00:37,473
Here you see a flare.

10
00:00:37,473 --> 00:00:40,656
It's a bright feature that extends
from the Sun surface.

11
00:00:40,669 --> 00:00:42,889
And you see that the size is considerable.

12
00:00:42,889 --> 00:00:48,099
If you have here, the relative size
of a Jupiter versus the Sun.

13
00:00:48,099 --> 00:00:51,190
Jupiter is about 1/10
of the size of the Sun

14
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:53,364
and just below Jupiter
you have the Earth.

15
00:00:53,364 --> 00:00:56,668
The Earth is about 1/10
the size of Jupiter,

16
00:00:56,668 --> 00:00:59,868
so about 1/100 of the size of the Sun.

17
00:00:59,868 --> 00:01:02,623
So you see these features are enormous

18
00:01:02,623 --> 00:01:06,570
compared to cold bodies
of the solar system.

19
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,269
These are flares:
bright features extending away

20
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,152
from the surface of the Sun.

21
00:01:11,849 --> 00:01:13,403
Here you see a prominence.

22
00:01:13,403 --> 00:01:17,148
A prominence again, is a bright feature
extending from the surface of the Sun.

23
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:20,397
following the local magnetic field,

24
00:01:20,397 --> 00:01:25,586
I mean, all these features are driven
by the magnetic field of the Sun.

25
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:28,120
The Sun is in fact a magnetic star.

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,583
It is totally driven
in the motion of the particles:

27
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:34,513
charged particles obviously,
by the magnetic field.

28
00:01:35,013 --> 00:01:38,889
The prominences are extended away
from the surface of the Sun

29
00:01:38,889 --> 00:01:41,909
and then reconnecting with the surface.

30
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,402
They follow small loops
in the local magnetic field of the Sun.

31
00:01:47,402 --> 00:01:51,701
They are visible also
during total solar eclipses.

32
00:01:52,165 --> 00:01:56,226
So they radiate in the visible part
of the spectrum.

33
00:01:56,226 --> 00:02:00,155
It's a magnificent view
during a total solar eclipse

34
00:02:00,155 --> 00:02:02,936
to see the bright features
on the surface of the Sun,

35
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:04,464
and the prominences.

36
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,826
Coronal mass ejections
are much larger features.

37
00:02:08,826 --> 00:02:11,507
And they don't reconnect
to the surface of the Sun,

38
00:02:11,507 --> 00:02:13,318
but they extend outwards.

39
00:02:13,318 --> 00:02:16,387
They produce a large flux
of charged particles

40
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:19,729
that extends into the solar wind
and into the solar system.

41
00:02:20,694 --> 00:02:23,028
They are most of the time observed

42
00:02:23,028 --> 00:02:25,654
in the short wavelength part
of the spectrum,

43
00:02:25,654 --> 00:02:28,996
typically in the ultraviolet,
extreme ultraviolet,

44
00:02:28,996 --> 00:02:30,450
or even X-rays.

45
00:02:30,918 --> 00:02:35,527
And they really connect the Sun electrically
and in terms of charged particles

46
00:02:35,527 --> 00:02:37,090
with the solar system.

47
00:02:37,636 --> 00:02:41,540
Here we have large
coronal mass ejections seen by SOHO.

48
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:47,709
SOHO is a ESA/NASA
Sun-observing satellite,

49
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:51,516
Solar and Heliospheric Observatory,
located, by the way,

50
00:02:51,516 --> 00:02:54,106
on the so called Lagrange L1 point.

51
00:02:54,106 --> 00:02:57,651
So the Sun-Earth system,
we'll talk about that later in the course.

52
00:02:57,871 --> 00:03:02,015
SOHO always remains
in the same position versus the Earth:

53
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:06,252
about 1.5 million km towards the Sun.

54
00:03:06,252 --> 00:03:09,776
But it tracks the Earth
as it goes around the Sun

55
00:03:09,776 --> 00:03:12,691
and always keeps the same
relative position to the Earth

56
00:03:12,691 --> 00:03:14,751
as the Earth goes around the Sun.

57
00:03:14,751 --> 00:03:17,604
So it always has the same view of the Sun,

58
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:21,136
and it also always remains
the same distance to the Earth

59
00:03:21,149 --> 00:03:25,717
which helps in the communication
of the data back to our planet.

60
00:03:25,982 --> 00:03:33,880
Now you have the disk that is
occulting the Sun surface itself.

61
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,688
In fact, the white circle
represents the Sun itself,

62
00:03:37,688 --> 00:03:40,036
the disk is a little bit larger
than the size of the Sun

63
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:42,901
in order to occult
the lower atmosphere of the Sun.

64
00:03:42,901 --> 00:03:45,920
And here you have huge
coronal mass ejections

65
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,298
and again, representing
a large amount of charged particles

66
00:03:50,308 --> 00:03:53,611
flowing into the solar system
including towards the Earth.

67
00:03:53,611 --> 00:03:56,974
And you have two views
colored differently

68
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:59,615
but the same phenomenon
on the left and on the right:

69
00:03:59,615 --> 00:04:03,871
huge coronal mass ejections
from the Sun seen by SOHO.

70
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:08,580
This is a videotape of SOHO observations
over a period of about 17 days

71
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,786
at the end of April
and the beginning of May 2000.

72
00:04:11,786 --> 00:04:15,835
The Sun is moving with respect
to the stars at about 1 degree per day

73
00:04:15,835 --> 00:04:20,105
because it goes a full circle,
360 degrees in one year.

74
00:04:20,525 --> 00:04:24,307
And it follows the ecliptic line
on the celestial sphere.

75
00:04:24,307 --> 00:04:27,545
You can see the huge,
massive coronal mass ejections

76
00:04:28,805 --> 00:04:32,021
And as we see it the second time,
I would like to point out

77
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,042
the plantets that are visible.

78
00:04:34,042 --> 00:04:39,269
We have planet Saturn in the lower left,
moving to the right.

79
00:04:39,269 --> 00:04:42,277
Not moving much with respect to the stars
because it's so far away.

80
00:04:42,277 --> 00:04:44,846
Then you have the planet Mercury
crossing the Sun right now

81
00:04:44,846 --> 00:04:47,143
and appearing on the left-hand side.

82
00:04:47,643 --> 00:04:50,812
Just before the end of the clip
you'll see planet Venus

83
00:04:50,812 --> 00:04:53,161
coming from the right-hand side.
