00:00:05,994 --> 00:00:08,120
Hello everyone, welcome to Unit 1:

2
00:00:08,120 --> 00:00:13,068
Brief Review of the Laws of Mechanics
and Introduction to the Space Environment.

3
00:00:13,343 --> 00:00:18,695
By the way, we have a beautiful picture 
of a very young Moon in the background.

4
00:00:19,352 --> 00:00:23,184
This is the Moon only
a few hours after New Moon,

5
00:00:23,184 --> 00:00:24,914
with a very, very thin crescent.

6
00:00:24,914 --> 00:00:28,864
It's impossible to see such a view 
of the Moon from the Earth,

7
00:00:28,864 --> 00:00:32,183
because from an angular point of view,
the Moon is so close to the Sun,

8
00:00:32,183 --> 00:00:35,323
that it's only from space 
that you can get such a shot,

9
00:00:35,323 --> 00:00:38,628
taken from
the International Space Station.

10
00:00:39,806 --> 00:00:43,327
Now, this week we'll talk about 1.2,

11
00:00:43,327 --> 00:00:45,785
a Review of the Laws of Mechanics.

12
00:00:45,785 --> 00:00:50,232
1.3, there will be an Introduction
to the New Space Environment.

13
00:00:50,626 --> 00:00:54,194
1.4 will be Magnetic Field in the Sun.

14
00:00:54,194 --> 00:00:56,532
1.5, Radiation Environment.

15
00:00:56,532 --> 00:00:59,938
1.6 Orbital Lifetime, Space Debris,

16
00:00:59,938 --> 00:01:04,008
and Asteroid/Comet Collision Threats.

17
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:08,746
We've prepared some practice quizzes 
after each video to make sure

18
00:01:08,746 --> 00:01:12,424
that you have understood the concepts
explained in these videos.

19
00:01:13,105 --> 00:01:18,313
Each section, from 1.2 to 1.6, 
is concluded by a control quiz.

20
00:01:18,313 --> 00:01:21,401
In addition, there is a test 
at the end of this Unit.

21
00:01:21,771 --> 00:01:24,725
We encourage you to do 
all the quizzes and the test,

22
00:01:24,725 --> 00:01:28,189
but note that only the control quiz
at the end of each section,

23
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:31,170
and the test, will contribute
to the final grade.

24
00:01:32,438 --> 00:01:36,193
Now, to illustrate this Unit
we have prepared a focus

25
00:01:36,193 --> 00:01:38,709
on Space Debris Observation 
and Removal

26
00:01:38,709 --> 00:01:43,302
with the interviews of 
Thomas Schildknecht and Muriel Richard,

27
00:01:43,302 --> 00:01:46,857
two Swiss experts,
on the subject of space debris.

28
00:01:47,185 --> 00:01:49,797
Looking at these is facultative,

29
00:01:49,797 --> 00:01:52,427
but we encourage you
to watch these interviews

30
00:01:52,427 --> 00:01:55,749
in order to deepen your knowledge
about this particular subject
