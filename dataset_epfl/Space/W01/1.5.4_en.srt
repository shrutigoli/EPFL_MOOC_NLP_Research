1
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:10,635
Let's talk now about radiation balance
for a spacecraft close to planet Earth.

2
00:00:10,817 --> 00:00:13,531
You see the spacecraft represented here,

3
00:00:13,531 --> 00:00:19,119
and obviously, the exchange of energy
between other bodies in the Solar System

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,953
and the background, the Universe
of the celestial spheres,

5
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:28,780
this exchange of energy
only in the form of radiation.

6
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:32,600
Possibly some flux of particles,
typically the solar wind,

7
00:00:32,600 --> 00:00:35,846
impact a certain energy
to the spacecraft,

8
00:00:35,846 --> 00:00:40,943
but I would say, that 99.9%
of the energy exchange

9
00:00:40,943 --> 00:00:42,973
is in the form of radiation.

10
00:00:42,973 --> 00:00:45,773
Now, if we consider a spacecraft
in the vicinity of the Earth,

11
00:00:45,773 --> 00:00:48,508
there are several sources of radiation,

12
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:52,265
obviously, the dominant source
is the radiation from the Sun.

13
00:00:53,045 --> 00:01:00,316
Again, the direct solar flux,
the solar constant, 1,368 W/m&sup2;.

14
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:02,289
This is totally dominant.

15
00:01:02,289 --> 00:01:05,145
We mentioned already the albedo
of the Earth,

16
00:01:05,145 --> 00:01:08,804
about 30% of the radiation of the Sun
impacting the Earth

17
00:01:08,804 --> 00:01:11,533
is coming back towards space,

18
00:01:11,533 --> 00:01:15,462
typically, is what the spacecraft,
if it is in the vicinity of the Earth.

19
00:01:16,122 --> 00:01:19,585
We talked about
the Earth infrared radiation

20
00:01:20,075 --> 00:01:22,440
with the two components
that we mentioned;

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,234
this is another source of radiation
of the spacecraft.

22
00:01:25,874 --> 00:01:28,694
Now there's another source,
but it's a very rare and dim source;

23
00:01:28,694 --> 00:01:35,470
this is the background radiation
from the sky

24
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:41,217
which corresponds to a black body
of about 2.6 Kelvin,

25
00:01:42,193 --> 00:01:48,406
which is of course, is very, very low
intensity, or energy radiation.

26
00:01:49,126 --> 00:01:52,383
But if you have a spacecraft
in the vicinity of the Earth,

27
00:01:52,383 --> 00:01:55,213
obviously, the dominant source
is the Sun.

28
00:01:56,263 --> 00:01:58,281
Now, we have a situation
of radiation balance.

29
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:02,621
The absorbed radiation by the spacecraft
is going to be equal

30
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:05,862
to the emitted radiation
in a balanced situation.

31
00:02:06,312 --> 00:02:10,696
When we talk about absorbed,
we could have, possibly, in addition

32
00:02:10,696 --> 00:02:15,029
the self generated power
by the electrical system generating heat,

33
00:02:15,029 --> 00:02:17,840
and the energy inside
the spacecraft itself.

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,484
This has to be added
to the absorbed radiation

35
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:22,695
but all of this has to be emitted.

36
00:02:22,695 --> 00:02:24,967
So <i>Pₐ </i> equal <i>Pₑ</i>,

37
00:02:24,967 --> 00:02:29,409
balance of radiation is
a fundamental feature in a spacecraft.

38
00:02:30,639 --> 00:02:36,513
Now we had the Stefan-Boltzmann law
which is giving the value

39
00:02:36,513 --> 00:02:40,695
of the emitted radiation per unit surface
in the case of a black body,

40
00:02:40,695 --> 00:02:44,865
it's equal to sigma,
the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,

41
00:02:45,825 --> 00:02:48,791
times the power four of the temperature.

42
00:02:48,791 --> 00:02:53,115
So this is a fundamental law,
the Stefan-Boltzmann law,

43
00:02:53,115 --> 00:02:56,357
<i>Pₑ</i> equals sigma times <i>T^4</i>.

44
00:02:56,357 --> 00:02:59,339
Let's talk about the radiation balance
for our spacecraft.

45
00:02:59,789 --> 00:03:04,230
Now, we will consider a spacecraft
that is only illuminated by the Sun.

46
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:06,281
Again, this is
a dominant radiation source

47
00:03:06,281 --> 00:03:07,732
on the spacecraft.

48
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:11,959
So <i>Pₐ</i> equals <i>Pₑ</i>,
and we don't have a black body

49
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:17,979
so <i>Pₐ</i> is equal to the solar constant
times the surface of the spacecraft

50
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:20,088
which is exposed to the Sun,

51
00:03:20,088 --> 00:03:24,570
times a factor alpha, which is
the solar absorptivity.

52
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,962
If we had a black body,
then the alpha would be equal to one.

53
00:03:27,962 --> 00:03:30,734
If we talk about the emitted radiation

54
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:36,306
again, it's not a black body,
so we have to introduce epsilon,

55
00:03:36,306 --> 00:03:41,791
which is the infrared emissivity
times sigma <i>T^4</i>,

56
00:03:41,791 --> 00:03:44,247
this is the Stefan-Boltzmann law,

57
00:03:44,247 --> 00:03:49,775
times the total surface of the satellite
or the spacecraft we are talking about.

58
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:53,067
Now, if we have <i>Pₐ </i> equals <i>Pₑ</i>,

59
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:57,242
obviously, if we know the geometrical
characteristics of the spacecraft

60
00:03:57,242 --> 00:03:58,543
on one hand,

61
00:03:58,543 --> 00:04:02,658
and also the alpha, and the epsilon value
for the surface of the spacecraft,

62
00:04:02,658 --> 00:04:05,204
we can see that we have the possibility

63
00:04:05,204 --> 00:04:07,478
to extract the value T,
of the temperature of the spacecraft,

64
00:04:07,478 --> 00:04:09,799
or the average temperature
of the spacecraft.

65
00:04:10,629 --> 00:04:14,441
Now, again, we put <i>Pₑ</i> equal <i>Pₐ</i>,

66
00:04:14,441 --> 00:04:16,574
and with the expression we had
on the previous slide

67
00:04:16,574 --> 00:04:18,671
we can extract the temperature

68
00:04:18,671 --> 00:04:21,154
which, interestingly enough,

69
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:25,273
is equal to alpha divided
by epsilon to the power of 1/4.

70
00:04:25,273 --> 00:04:28,934
So, the characteristics of the outside
of the spacecraft

71
00:04:28,934 --> 00:04:31,937
in terms of emissivity and absorptivity 
will play a role

72
00:04:31,937 --> 00:04:34,328
in the average temperature
of the spacecraft,

73
00:04:34,328 --> 00:04:37,154
times the other factor
which is the solar constant,

74
00:04:37,714 --> 00:04:39,708
the Stefan-Boltzmann constant,

75
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:44,033
and the ratio between the surface
of the spacecraft exposed

76
00:04:44,033 --> 00:04:46,135
to the solar radiation,

77
00:04:46,135 --> 00:04:49,825
divided by the total surface
of the spacecraft.

78
00:04:49,825 --> 00:04:53,878
Now, this expression
for the temperature of the spacecraft

79
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:58,608
is only valid if the radiation coming
from the Sun is of course,

80
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:01,988
only impacting the part of the spacecraft
exposed to the Sun

81
00:05:01,988 --> 00:05:04,011
but still distributed
over the whole spacecraft.

82
00:05:04,011 --> 00:05:07,513
Typically, it's valid if we have
a rotating spacecraft

83
00:05:07,513 --> 00:05:10,506
and not always the same surface
exposed to the Sun.

84
00:05:11,176 --> 00:05:15,098
Typically, this expression for <i>T</i>
won't be valid for SOHO,

85
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:18,287
because SOHO is always
one part of the spacecraft

86
00:05:18,287 --> 00:05:19,739
constantly exposed to the Sun,

87
00:05:19,739 --> 00:05:22,118
that's where you have the cameras,
the coronograph

88
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:25,304
and all the detection system
for the Sun radiation

89
00:05:25,304 --> 00:05:27,053
and of course, the other side
of the spacecraft

90
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:28,643
is always in the shadow.

91
00:05:28,643 --> 00:05:31,078
So these expression for <i>T</i>
of the spacecraft

92
00:05:31,078 --> 00:05:33,039
is an average value which is valid

93
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,706
only for a rotating spacecraft,

94
00:05:34,706 --> 00:05:37,403
or a spacecraft for which
the solar radiation

95
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:41,158
impacting the spacecraft is distributed 
over the whole surface.

96
00:05:41,158 --> 00:05:44,122
Here we have a table
of the properties of materials

97
00:05:44,122 --> 00:05:45,799
with values that are of interest

98
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:47,794
to determine
the temperature of the spacecraft

99
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:50,192
like we talked about before,

100
00:05:50,192 --> 00:05:53,096
where the solar absorption
coefficient alpha,

101
00:05:53,096 --> 00:05:57,677
and the infrared emissivity epsilon
are listed for various materials

102
00:05:57,677 --> 00:06:01,321
and noteworthy are gold,

103
00:06:02,231 --> 00:06:07,019
where you have
the average absorption coefficient alpha,

104
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,039
but you have
a very low value of emissivity

105
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:16,425
so the ratio of absorptivity
to emissivity is going to be rather large,

106
00:06:16,425 --> 00:06:19,339
which means
that the equilibrium temperature

107
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:23,732
of the surface of gold exposed
to the Sun is going to be very high.

108
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:29,544
And on the other end of the spectrum
if I can say, you have

109
00:06:29,544 --> 00:06:34,472
a white epoxy, with the medium value
of absorptivity,

110
00:06:34,472 --> 00:06:38,656
but a very high value of emissivity
and for that reason,

111
00:06:39,256 --> 00:06:45,223
the ratio absorptivity divided
by emissivity is very low,

112
00:06:45,223 --> 00:06:47,625
which means that you are going
to have a low temperature.

113
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:53,004
So these are the two extremes
of substances that you can use

114
00:06:53,004 --> 00:06:54,463
on the surface of a spacecraft,

115
00:06:54,463 --> 00:06:58,104
to get either a high temperature,
in the case of gold,

116
00:06:58,104 --> 00:07:00,253
if you desire to have a high temperature,

117
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,846
and low temperature
you use white epoxy.

118
00:07:03,253 --> 00:07:07,504
This is a kind of a summary
of the spacecraft design strategies,

119
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:09,634
a feature that you want to introduce
in the spacecraft

120
00:07:09,634 --> 00:07:11,584
in order to be in a good situation

121
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:15,202
in terms of the proper functioning
of the spacecraft

122
00:07:15,202 --> 00:07:17,269
and a proper temperature also.

123
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,627
You want to have a conducting surface
on the spacecraft.

124
00:07:19,627 --> 00:07:23,858
You don't want to have
electrical insulation

125
00:07:23,858 --> 00:07:26,841
between two parts of the spacecraft
which are exposed outside

126
00:07:26,841 --> 00:07:28,999
because you may have differences
in potentials,

127
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:31,818
you could have discharges,
which could be really damaging

128
00:07:31,818 --> 00:07:33,205
for the spacecraft.

129
00:07:33,205 --> 00:07:36,852
So a conducting surface of the spacecraft
to avoid local voltage deltas

130
00:07:36,852 --> 00:07:39,929
and possibly
resulting electrical discharges.

131
00:07:41,309 --> 00:07:44,745
We mentioned that you want to have
hardening of electronic components

132
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:50,522
so if you have increased 
solar particle flux

133
00:07:50,522 --> 00:07:53,601
typically following coronal ejections

134
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:58,891
then you still want to have
the electronic system in the spacecraft

135
00:07:58,891 --> 00:08:01,384
functioning properly,
so you need a hardening,

136
00:08:01,384 --> 00:08:03,756
which is going to be covered
in other courses.

137
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:07,429
And we just mentioned that the value
of alpha divided by epsilon

138
00:08:07,429 --> 00:08:09,176
has to be chosen properly,

139
00:08:09,176 --> 00:08:13,793
in order to have a temperature
of the surface of the spacecraft

140
00:08:13,793 --> 00:08:17,063
in the range of the desired, for 
a proper funtioning of this spacecraft.
