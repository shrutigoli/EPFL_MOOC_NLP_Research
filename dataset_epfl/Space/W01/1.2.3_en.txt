Conservation laws. 
These are fundamental laws that we'll be using very often in the rest of the course.
But first of all, before we get to these laws, we need to define the potential energy of a spacecraft of a mass <i>m</i> in the gravitational field of a much larger mass <i>M</i>.
And this <i>M</i> could be the mass of the Earth, if we have a spacecraft on orbit around the Earth, or it could be the mass of the Sun, if we have an interplanetary trajectory.
Now you see the drawing, <i>M</i> and <i>m</i>.
The <i>m</i> with a velocity <i>v</i>.
And again, we have a <i>M</i> much larger than <i>m</i>, so the center of mass of the two bodies is basically at the center of the large mass, <i>M</i>.
Now, the potential energy is equal to <i>-GM</i> times the mass of the small body divided by <i>r</i>, the distance between the large body and the spacecraft.
Again, most of the time when it's for force, or for energy we'll be using a unit mass, so the potential energy per unit mass is equal to -<i> &micro; /r</i>,
<i>&micro;</i> being <i>G</i> times <i>M</i>, the mass of the large body.
Let's see for now the kinetic energy for a spacecraft of mass <i>m</i>, and the gravitational field of a much larger mass <i>M</i>.
You see the drawing here; you have the velocity of the small body, the kinetic energy is equal to <i>&frac12; mv&sup2; <i>.
You don't have the mass of the large body involved, obviously, in this.
And again, we most of the time express it per unit mass.
So kinetic energy per unit mass is equal to <i>&frac12; v&sup2;</i>.
The three conservation laws that we have, and again, these are absolutely fundamental, is the conservation of momentum.
If you have an isolated system with the absence of any forces you have a conservation of the momentum,
<i>p</i> vector, equal to <i>m v vector</i>.
The second equivalent law for rotation is the conservation of the angular momentum,
<i>r x p vector</i>  in an isolated system.
This time not in the absence of force, but in the absence of torques.
Now, the third law, the conservation of mechanical energy, is absolutely fundamental.
Potential plus kinetic energy in an isolated system, again in the absence of external forces and torques, and in a conservative force field.
And a conservative force field is applicable for gravitational force field or electrical field.
It's a field within which if you go from one place to the other, whatever the path you use to go from one place to the other within this field, you'll be using the same energy, independent of the path between one point A and one point B within this field.
So, within a conservative force field, gravitational or electrical, you have the conservation of mechanical energy, and this mechanical energy is defined as the sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy.
You see these here.
If you have a spacecraft with a mass <i>m</i>, with a velocity <i>v_1</i> as you have here, and it's moving over there with a velocity <i>v_2</i>, the same mass, no change of mass, and no friction in between, you have a conservative force field.
If it was a non-conservative force field you could go from one place to the other with a different amount of energy change because of a dissipating medium like an atmosphere, or some dissipating force of some sort.
But if you have a conservative force field you really have the sum of the potential and kinetic energy being the same when you go from one place to the other within this field.
Conservation of mechanical energy in a conservative force field.
Very important conservation law.
Now, you have here translation of important terms of mechanics.
We have different terms in English, on the left-hand side, force, mass, speed or velocity, momentum, angular momentum, torque, and moment of inertia, and we have here the translation in French, in German, in Spanish,
<i>en FranÃ§ais, auf Deutsch, y tambiÃ©n en espaÃ±ol</i>, and we encourage you to provide us with translations of these fundamental terms in the various languages which are your languages.
Thank you.
