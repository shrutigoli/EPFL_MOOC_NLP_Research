00:00:06,133 --> 00:00:07,171
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:07,293 --> 00:00:10,343
Today we will talk about
the geomagnetic field

3
00:00:10,409 --> 00:00:12,809
and the distortions of
the geomagnetic field

4
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:14,777
due to the solar wind.

5
00:00:14,888 --> 00:00:20,525
Here we have an expression
of the value of the B field

6
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:24,275
the amplitude of
the B field vector

7
00:00:24,395 --> 00:00:29,145
in the vicinity of the Earth,
because it's basically a bi-polar

8
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:32,531
magnetic field pretty much like
the one you have with a magnet

9
00:00:32,654 --> 00:00:37,417
which has a magnetic north pole,
magnetic south pole and this

10
00:00:37,535 --> 00:00:40,885
is the expression again, of
the amplitude of the B vector

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:44,707
as a function of R, the distance
from the center of the Earth

12
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:49,148
and λ, which is the latitude,
pretty much like the latitude

13
00:00:49,261 --> 00:00:53,599
on the surface of the earth,
whether λ0 being the equator

14
00:00:53,713 --> 00:00:58,163
and the +90 being the north pole,
and -90 the south pole.

15
00:00:58,446 --> 00:01:02,884
Now, let's say here that
the geomagnetic field

16
00:01:02,975 --> 00:01:04,250
is essentially a bi-polar field

17
00:01:04,344 --> 00:01:06,269
slightly off center from
the center of the Earth.

18
00:01:06,396 --> 00:01:08,796
We will talk about this offset
later, but for time being

19
00:01:08,914 --> 00:01:11,702
let's consider that it's centered
on the center of the Earth

20
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:19,580
and you have that value as
a function of R, λ, and B0

21
00:01:19,718 --> 00:01:24,456
is the value of the magnetic field
amplitude either in Gauss

22
00:01:24,556 --> 00:01:31,694
or in Tesla, 3.12x(10^(-5)) Tesla

23
00:01:31,763 --> 00:01:34,763
on the equator and on
the surface of the Earth.

24
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:39,910
Now, as far as the shape of
the magnetic field line

25
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:41,908
distribution is,
this is what you have

26
00:01:42,022 --> 00:01:46,247
again it's a standard
bi-polar magnetic field.

27
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:51,860
By the way, you have here
the North magnetic pole

28
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:54,778
and here the South magnetic pole,
and these are not co-located

29
00:01:54,896 --> 00:01:57,221
with the geographical
poles of the Earth

30
00:01:57,357 --> 00:02:02,207
and they are about eleven degrees
away from the geographical poles

31
00:02:02,294 --> 00:02:06,744
and there is a slow drift
of the location, as well

32
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:09,852
the North and South magnetic poles
on the surface of the Earth.

33
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:13,460
Right now we have the North
magnetic pole, which is in

34
00:02:13,554 --> 00:02:16,304
Northern Canada,
but it's drifting slowly

35
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:18,409
about ten kilometers every year.

36
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:24,113
It's moving toward Northern Siberia,
so in a few decades we will have

37
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:30,397
the North magnetic pole in Siberia,
no longer in Northern Canada, like it is now.

38
00:02:30,772 --> 00:02:34,747
Now what we've depicted here
also this outer radiation belt

39
00:02:34,846 --> 00:02:40,333
or the van Allen belts, which
are areas with increased radiation

40
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:43,816
the inner radiation belt,
which is depicted here

41
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:48,408
that goes down to about
500 to 600 kilometers

42
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:53,246
above the Earth's surface is mainly
populated by quite high energy

43
00:02:53,327 --> 00:02:56,389
electrons and protons,
and the outer radiation belt

44
00:02:56,489 --> 00:03:00,889
here is mainly electrons,
pretty high velocities respectively

45
00:03:00,968 --> 00:03:04,293
energy, these are areas that we
try to avoid with the spacecraft

46
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,083
we try to have a relatively rapid
go through the radiation belt

47
00:03:09,179 --> 00:03:12,591
because obviously, this could be
damaging for electronic components

48
00:03:12,743 --> 00:03:14,993
of a spacecraft.

49
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:19,120
Again, this is a summary, we have
high energy protons and electrons

50
00:03:19,252 --> 00:03:21,690
trapped in two regions of
the magnetosphere

51
00:03:21,805 --> 00:03:24,805
the van Allen or the radiation belts

52
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,665
protons and electrons
in the radiation belt

53
00:03:27,753 --> 00:03:30,816
and electrons only in
the outer radiation belt.

54
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:33,218
Near the bottom you have
the value of the energy

55
00:03:33,341 --> 00:03:40,154
radiation particles, typically
more than 30keV to 100MeV.

56
00:03:41,388 --> 00:03:46,188
here we have a large scale artist
representation of the geomagnetic

57
00:03:46,278 --> 00:03:49,853
field with it's distortion
due to the solar wind.

58
00:03:49,945 --> 00:03:53,045
Now this drawing is not to scale,
obviously if you look at the sun

59
00:03:53,136 --> 00:03:55,311
on the left hand side, the size of

60
00:03:55,403 --> 00:03:58,403
the sun and the position
of the Earth

61
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:01,603
and the size of the Earth,
this is not the scale but

62
00:04:01,736 --> 00:04:05,923
just look at the representation
of the magnetic field of the Earth

63
00:04:06,008 --> 00:04:10,071
in the vicinity of the Earth first,
and then when we go further away

64
00:04:10,303 --> 00:04:16,566
with several Earth radii away from
the Earth, you see this significant

65
00:04:16,672 --> 00:04:19,209
distortion due to the solar wind.

66
00:04:19,355 --> 00:04:22,768
What is interesting is that,
you have here the so called

67
00:04:22,876 --> 00:04:27,988
polar cusps, which will allow
particles of the solar wind

68
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,930
mainly high energy protons,
to enter the relatively low region

69
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:34,624
of the Earth's atmosphere.

70
00:04:34,714 --> 00:04:38,364
Charge particles normally don't
cross magnetic field lines

71
00:04:38,453 --> 00:04:40,190
but they attract them,
they go along them

72
00:04:40,308 --> 00:04:43,933
maybe in spiral shape,
but these are areas

73
00:04:44,022 --> 00:04:48,134
where the solar wind particles,
mainly high energy electrons

74
00:04:48,248 --> 00:04:52,823
and protons can penetrate
the high layers of the atmosphere

75
00:04:52,938 --> 00:04:58,726
and create the Aurora phenomenon,
as well as Northern lights

76
00:04:58,812 --> 00:05:00,224
and Southern lights.

77
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,088
What is interesting also,
is that in the anti-sun direction

78
00:05:04,226 --> 00:05:11,289
you have open magnetic field lines
trailing in the far away regions of

79
00:05:11,378 --> 00:05:13,340
the Solar system.

80
00:05:13,735 --> 00:05:17,385
Here, the representation of Northern and,
Southern lights again this is due to

81
00:05:17,472 --> 00:05:21,634
the fact that in the polar region you
have a possibility of penetration

82
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:25,614
of the Solar wind particles in
the lower layers of the atmosphere

83
00:05:25,712 --> 00:05:28,212
high and low layers
of the atmosphere

84
00:05:28,344 --> 00:05:33,581
created by exaltation of
mainly oxygen atoms

85
00:05:33,897 --> 00:05:36,184
higher state of energy
of these atoms and then

86
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:40,977
there is the de-excitation producing
this light phenomenon, mainly

87
00:05:41,066 --> 00:05:44,216
green light because this is
the wave length corresponding

88
00:05:44,354 --> 00:05:48,829
to this de-excitation of particles
of oxygen in the atmosphere.

89
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:55,770
Normally these are located
along the so called oval around

90
00:05:55,885 --> 00:06:00,073
the Northern magnetic pole,
and the Southern magnetic pole

91
00:06:00,196 --> 00:06:04,784
and all of the vertical lines
that you see in these Aurora

92
00:06:04,866 --> 00:06:07,866
or Norther on Southern lights
correspond to the direction of

93
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:10,916
the magnetic field lines,
which again in the region

94
00:06:10,995 --> 00:06:14,145
of the poles are nearly
perpendicular to the surface

95
00:06:14,253 --> 00:06:18,703
as opposed to the equatorial
regions where you have

96
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:21,810
the magnetic field lines
pretty much horizontal.

97
00:06:21,887 --> 00:06:23,849
Another feature that
we can point out is that

98
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:27,718
the presence of the constellation
Orion here you see the Orion's belt

99
00:06:27,794 --> 00:06:30,844
here with the three aligned stars,
in fact it's Orion upside down

100
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:34,472
with the three stars which
are very visible in the winter

101
00:06:34,562 --> 00:06:37,562
from the northern hemisphere
with the naked eye.

102
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:40,649
This is the view of the Earth from
the International Space Station

103
00:06:40,725 --> 00:06:44,600
taken recently where over
the Indian ocean, it's at night

104
00:06:44,713 --> 00:06:47,363
we have the landscape
illuminated by the moon

105
00:06:47,464 --> 00:06:52,464
and we have a beautiful
view of the southern lights.

106
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:55,692
We are in the vicinity of
the south magnetic pole

107
00:06:55,828 --> 00:06:58,490
which is somewhat on
the right hand side of the picture

108
00:06:58,629 --> 00:07:00,817
and a very clear view
of the southern lights

109
00:07:00,907 --> 00:07:03,907
and also of the air glow,
which gives you a scale

110
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,417
of the height of the southern
lights themselves

111
00:07:06,485 --> 00:07:09,485
the air glow being at 100km
above the Earth's surface.

112
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,990
It's accelerated motion,
it's been taken so that you have

113
00:07:13,115 --> 00:07:16,590
about ten times increased
velocity of the space station

114
00:07:16,706 --> 00:07:20,243
versus the Earth, we move fast but
not as fast as you can see here.

115
00:07:20,548 --> 00:07:23,348
It's interesting to see
the vertical line and

116
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:26,965
the structure of these Southern
lights which are along the magnetic

117
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:30,086
field line which in the vicinity
of the South magnetic pole

118
00:07:30,196 --> 00:07:33,671
are close to the vertical,
you see also a lot of dynamics

119
00:07:33,756 --> 00:07:35,744
in the Southern lights.
