1
00:00:06,083 --> 00:00:08,778
Let's talk about space debris today.

2
00:00:08,779 --> 00:00:11,922
The accumulation of space debris
over the decades,

3
00:00:11,923 --> 00:00:16,414
of space utilization
or space exploration on different orbits,

4
00:00:16,415 --> 00:00:21,265
the geostationary orbit,
the intermediate orbit and Low Earth Orbit

5
00:00:21,266 --> 00:00:23,114
has become a real problem

6
00:00:23,115 --> 00:00:26,586
because it will, 
if we don't take measures,

7
00:00:26,587 --> 00:00:29,632
it will make the access
to space really difficult

8
00:00:29,633 --> 00:00:32,141
because of the likelihood of collisions.

9
00:00:32,142 --> 00:00:36,034
Now, space debris is basically,
an object in space

10
00:00:36,035 --> 00:00:38,583
that is no longer functional and useful.

11
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:43,502
Obviously, as long as a satellite
is working well it's not a space debris,

12
00:00:43,503 --> 00:00:49,782
but as soon as it doesn't work anymore
then it is a space debris,

13
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:51,260
and if we have collisions

14
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:54,584
between functioning
and not functioning satellites,

15
00:00:54,584 --> 00:00:56,834
it can create a lot of extra debris.

16
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:58,993
If we look at this picture,

17
00:00:58,994 --> 00:01:01,839
which is an artist's view
of the distribution of space debris,

18
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,084
we see that we have
a particular accumulation

19
00:01:05,084 --> 00:01:10,304
at the geostationary orbit,
which is over the Equator,

20
00:01:10,305 --> 00:01:13,205
36,000 km above the Earth's surface,

21
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:16,533
or 42,000 km from the Earth's center.

22
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,709
Obviously, we have
a lot of satellites there

23
00:01:18,709 --> 00:01:21,696
because most
of the communication satellites

24
00:01:21,696 --> 00:01:24,095
are located on this orbit.

25
00:01:24,096 --> 00:01:26,792
Obviously, there is a rule
about the distribution

26
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:32,176
of communication satellites
along this track,

27
00:01:32,177 --> 00:01:35,480
their allocation to certain areas

28
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:37,286
where satellites can be located;

29
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:38,973
and now, there are new rules,

30
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:41,274
in the sense
that when a communication satellite

31
00:01:41,275 --> 00:01:43,065
is becoming no longer functional,

32
00:01:43,066 --> 00:01:46,640
it has to be moved
to a so-called graveyard orbit

33
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:49,225
normally above the geostationary orbit.

34
00:01:49,226 --> 00:01:53,210
For Low Earth Orbit where we have
a large accumulation of debris,

35
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:58,422
roughly between 200 km altitude
above the Earth surface and 2,000,

36
00:01:58,423 --> 00:02:00,454
which is the definition
of the low Earth orbit,

37
00:02:00,455 --> 00:02:04,879
we have about 20,000 debris
which are tracked,

38
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,689
with the size of 10 cm or more.

39
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:12,345
These objects are tracked, which means

40
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:15,890
that if there is a spacecraft,
like the International Space Station

41
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:21,576
and it's determined
that in a few orbits or a few days

42
00:02:21,584 --> 00:02:25,041
we are going to have
an uncomfortable situation

43
00:02:25,042 --> 00:02:27,459
where a space debris
is coming very close

44
00:02:27,462 --> 00:02:31,505
to the International Space Station,
which would cause a collision,

45
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:35,779
then we can change somewhat the orbit
of the International Space Station

46
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:38,064
to make this distance a little bit larger.

47
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:40,895
So measures can be taken
on active spacecraft

48
00:02:40,896 --> 00:02:42,487
like the International Space Station,

49
00:02:42,488 --> 00:02:45,733
but for satellites, which have
normally altitude control,

50
00:02:45,734 --> 00:02:46,825
for some of them,

51
00:02:46,826 --> 00:02:52,215
but not necessarily a possibility
to change the geometry of the orbit,

52
00:02:52,216 --> 00:02:55,279
then collision is something
that can happen sometimes,

53
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,438
and, in fact, it did happen
a few times in the past.

54
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:03,368
This is an artist view of the distribution
of space debris

55
00:03:03,369 --> 00:03:04,740
in the Low Earth Orbit.

56
00:03:04,741 --> 00:03:07,259
Now, it seems very frightening,
but you have to consider

57
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:13,834
that the scale of the representation
by the artist of the satellites,

58
00:03:13,834 --> 00:03:17,335
or the space debris themselves,
and the Earth,

59
00:03:17,355 --> 00:03:21,102
is of course, not correct to the center.

60
00:03:21,103 --> 00:03:24,378
All of the satellites or debris
are represented at a larger scale

61
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:25,834
than the Earth.

62
00:03:25,835 --> 00:03:28,570
But anyways, this shows that there is

63
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:31,908
a very large number of debris
in the Low Earth Orbit,

64
00:03:31,909 --> 00:03:35,107
and measures had been taken
for Low Earth Orbit

65
00:03:35,108 --> 00:03:37,131
limiting the lifetime of satellites

66
00:03:37,132 --> 00:03:41,068
because at an altitude 
of, say, 6-7-800 km,

67
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:44,318
depending of course
on the ballistic coefficient,

68
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,109
which we talked about before,

69
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:50,481
the lifetime of the orbit can be
typically decades or even centuries.

70
00:03:50,482 --> 00:03:52,373
And now, there is a rule,

71
00:03:52,374 --> 00:03:54,546
any new satellite put on Low Earth Orbit

72
00:03:54,547 --> 00:03:59,031
has to have a lifetime
of 25 years maximum.

73
00:03:59,042 --> 00:04:03,779
After that, it has to be either deorbited
by a deorbiting pulse

74
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,467
generated by a thruster,

75
00:04:05,474 --> 00:04:10,541
or another way is to increase
the drag of the satellite,

76
00:04:10,542 --> 00:04:17,643
by some deployed mechanism
that will cause its destructive deorbit,

77
00:04:17,973 --> 00:04:19,456
and then it falls on Earth,

78
00:04:19,457 --> 00:04:22,001
but it's now really destroyed
in small particles

79
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:24,520
as it can't stand through the atmosphere.

80
00:04:24,521 --> 00:04:28,458
This is a spatial density of space debris

81
00:04:28,459 --> 00:04:31,459
in Low Earth Orbit versus altitude,

82
00:04:31,464 --> 00:04:34,010
according to
a relatively recent NASA report.

83
00:04:34,011 --> 00:04:38,918
It's quite interesting, because you see
that, for the really Low Earth Orbit

84
00:04:38,921 --> 00:04:43,119
between 200 and 400 km of altitude 
above the Earth surface,

85
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,185
the spatial density of the debris
is not too dramatic.

86
00:04:48,186 --> 00:04:50,706
The International Space Station

87
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:54,084
is maintaining an altitude
of about 400 km at this time.

88
00:04:54,097 --> 00:04:55,603
And, once again,

89
00:04:55,603 --> 00:05:00,051
sometimes we have an uncomfortable 
nearing of space debris

90
00:05:00,051 --> 00:05:01,566
with the International Space Station;

91
00:05:01,566 --> 00:05:03,464
if it is a debris that is tracked,

92
00:05:03,465 --> 00:05:05,751
it can be foreseen
and measures can be taken,

93
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:09,560
but the situation is not too dramatic

94
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:14,033
below, I would say, about 600 km
above the Earth's surface.

95
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:15,629
600 km, by the way,

96
00:05:15,630 --> 00:05:18,574
is the altitude of the orbit
of the Hubble Space Telescope

97
00:05:18,575 --> 00:05:20,498
which has been hit by some debris.

98
00:05:20,499 --> 00:05:24,691
There is one high-gain antenna
that has been hit by a meteorite

99
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:31,276
and created a small hole 
of a size of about 2â€”2.5 cm,

100
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:35,200
which has been visible during the visits
to the Hubble Space Telescope

101
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:37,755
in servicing missions until 2009,

102
00:05:37,756 --> 00:05:41,546
which is the last Hubble Space Telescope
servicing mission.

103
00:05:41,547 --> 00:05:47,341
You see a dramatic increase
in the spatial density of debris

104
00:05:47,594 --> 00:05:50,979
at the so-called
Sun-synchronous orbit altitude

105
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:54,799
which is roughly at 800â€”900 km.

106
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:57,626
And especially you have two peaks:

107
00:05:57,627 --> 00:06:02,590
one peak at about 780 km altitude

108
00:06:02,591 --> 00:06:05,342
corresponding 
to an Iridium cosmic breakupâ€”

109
00:06:05,343 --> 00:06:09,749
there was a collision in 2009
between these two satellites

110
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,223
an active Iridium,

111
00:06:11,224 --> 00:06:14,728
and a non-active debris-type
Cosmos satellite

112
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:17,400
this created a lot of extra debris.

113
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:19,132
This is the reason why we have this peak

114
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:22,751
at a little bit below 800 km altitude.

115
00:06:22,779 --> 00:06:27,188
There is another peak
at 850 km altitude

116
00:06:27,209 --> 00:06:30,706
corresponding to the Fengyun-1C Breakup.

117
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:33,977
There was a test
of an anti-satellite killer,

118
00:06:33,978 --> 00:06:37,824
a satellite in 2007 by the Chinese,

119
00:06:37,825 --> 00:06:40,981
which, following the destruction
of the satelliteâ€”

120
00:06:40,982 --> 00:06:42,342
so the test was successfulâ€”

121
00:06:42,343 --> 00:06:47,023
it created a cloud of debris
at about 850 km altitude.

122
00:06:47,392 --> 00:06:50,247
There is then a decrease
in the density of debris

123
00:06:50,248 --> 00:06:54,549
beyond the so-called
Sun-synchronous altitude;

124
00:06:54,549 --> 00:06:57,696
typically 800 
plus or minus 200 km altitude

125
00:06:57,696 --> 00:06:59,626
above the Earth surface.

126
00:06:59,626 --> 00:07:05,030
Now we have a small table showing
the annual probability of collision

127
00:07:05,031 --> 00:07:07,666
based on the projectile's size.

128
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:10,186
You have the International Space Station

129
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:12,806
at an altitude of 400 km,

130
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:16,691
the total surface about 500 square meters.

131
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:22,602
The likelihood of a collision
with very small debris

132
00:07:22,603 --> 00:07:27,299
of a size between 0.1 mm and 1 mm is 1,

133
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:31,555
which means that we have,
I would say, every day or even every week

134
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:34,378
a collision with very small debris
which, of course,

135
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,375
for the International Space Station
is not a problem.

136
00:07:37,376 --> 00:07:44,184
For objects which have
between 1 mm in size and 1 cm,

137
00:07:44,242 --> 00:07:48,980
you also have
relatively frequent collisions,

138
00:07:48,981 --> 00:07:53,611
but again, less than 1 cm
is for the International Space Station

139
00:07:53,612 --> 00:07:54,625
not a problem,

140
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:58,142
at least if they don't create a hole
in any of the modules,

141
00:07:58,142 --> 00:08:04,584
which are protected by a shield, MMOD,
Micrometeoroids and Orbital Debris shield,

142
00:08:04,601 --> 00:08:09,908
such that there is protection
against all of the debris collision

143
00:08:09,909 --> 00:08:13,879
if the debris is less
than 1 cm in size in metal.

144
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,237
You have the probability of debris

145
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:20,042
for a collision with a debris
of more than 10 cm in size,

146
00:08:20,043 --> 00:08:25,297
2 x 10 to the minus 4,
that's the annual value,

147
00:08:25,298 --> 00:08:28,137
so there is a very low likelihood
that this could happen.

148
00:08:28,137 --> 00:08:31,446
If you look at satellites
on higher orbits,

149
00:08:31,459 --> 00:08:35,077
typically SPOT satellites
at 800 km altitude,

150
00:08:35,078 --> 00:08:38,412
much smaller surface than the ISS,

151
00:08:38,413 --> 00:08:42,145
you see that the probability
of a collision with large debris

152
00:08:42,147 --> 00:08:45,921
of more than 10 cm in size
is about the same as for the ISS,

153
00:08:45,921 --> 00:08:51,318
and the reason is the higher density
of such debris at this altitude.

154
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:54,759
So these are the values
