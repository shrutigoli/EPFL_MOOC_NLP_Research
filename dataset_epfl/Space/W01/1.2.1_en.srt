00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:08,790
The fundamental laws 
of mechanics of Newton

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,770
The first law is: 
In the absence of a force

3
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:16,239
a body either is at rest or moves
in a straight line with constant speed

4
00:00:16,586 --> 00:00:20,020
and this is with respect
to what we call an inertial frame.

5
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:24,050
The frame of this room, for instance,
is not an inertial frame.

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:27,324
If we drop an object it's going to be
going toward the center of the Earth,

7
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:31,780
but there would be a slight deviation 
because we are in a rotating frame.

8
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,077
The Earth is rotating on itself 
and is also revolving around the Sun

9
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,504
but with respect to inertial frame,
and I'll come back to that later,

10
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:42,804
the first law is valid.

11
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:47,180
The second law is a fundamental 
law of mechanics:

12
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:53,620
A body experiencing a force <i>vectorial F</i>
will be subject to an acceleration <i>a vectorial</i>

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:56,800
such that <i>F vectorial</i> equals <i>m a vectorial</i>

14
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,700
where <i>m</i> is the mass of the body.

15
00:00:59,884 --> 00:01:02,570
The third law is the following:

16
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:05,979
Whenever a first body exerts
a force <i>F</i> on a second body,

17
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:09,900
the second body exerts a force
minus <i>F vectorial</i> on the first body.

18
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:13,770
The two forces are of equal magnitude
and opposite in direction.

19
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,030
This is really important.

20
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,250
The forces are always 
in couples in nature.

21
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:20,880
Whether it's the force that the Sun exerts
on the Earth and the Earth on the Sun,

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,430
these are equal in magnitude 
and opposite in direction.

23
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,600
I'm standing on the floor here.

24
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,880
There is a force of so many Newton,
which is my weight, toward the floor

25
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,100
but the floor exerts
a force of equal magnitude

26
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:38,420
but opposite direction on me so that
I am still with respect to the floor.

27
00:01:38,990 --> 00:01:41,897
Forces are always in couples in nature.

28
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,977
Generalization of Newton's second law:

29
00:01:45,977 --> 00:01:50,067
The force <i>F vectorial</i> equals <i>dp</i> over <i>dt</i>,

30
00:01:50,067 --> 00:01:52,850
<i>p</i> being the momentum,

31
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:56,245
the product of the mass
times the velocity vectorial,

32
00:01:56,447 --> 00:01:58,130
and this is a generalization.

33
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:02,220
We see that <i>dp</i> over <i>dt</i>, <i>p</i> equal <i>m v</i>.

34
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,184
If we have a variation in <i>m</i>,

35
00:02:04,184 --> 00:02:09,453
of course, that would be 
giving different results

36
00:02:09,453 --> 00:02:13,040
from the application of the law of Newton

37
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,810
as it was expressed on the last slide,

38
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:21,490
especially if we have a leaking system 
or if we handle subject of propulsion

39
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:24,770
at a later time in the course,
where, of course,

40
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:27,316
<i>m</i> is varying because we're expelling mass

41
00:02:27,316 --> 00:02:32,240
in the throttle of a propulsion system
of the spacecraft, for instance,

42
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,600
then it's important to use 
the generalization of Newton's second law.

43
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,210
Inertial frame

44
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:40,860
We talked about that briefly before.

45
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:41,980
It's really important

46
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,790
that all of the positions and velocities

47
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:48,670
that we will be using later, X, Y, Z,

48
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:54,460
and X dot, Y dot, Z dot, 
the time derivative of the position

49
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:56,390
with respect to inertial frame,

50
00:02:56,390 --> 00:02:58,450
and we'll define 
various inertial frames

51
00:02:58,450 --> 00:03:01,980
depending on whether we have 
the motion of a spacecraft or satellite

52
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:04,720
around the Earth or around the Sun,

53
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:10,150
or anywhere else in the universe, 
but inertial frame has direction,

54
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:14,490
direction of the axes which are basically, 
towards  distant stars

55
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,400
which are basically nodes moving on, 
moving very, very slowly,

56
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:22,680
and the concept is important.

57
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,350
An inertial frame is a frame

58
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:27,620
with respect to which 
the laws of Newton are valid,

59
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:31,790
and the center of the inertial frame, 
which is orthogonal coordinate system,

60
00:03:31,790 --> 00:03:33,740
will depend on the application.

61
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,280
Now the validity of Newton's law 
is very general.

62
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,030
It's a very powerful set of laws,

63
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,830
the Apollo program, 
the International Space Station,

64
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:47,160
the Shuttle program: all respect
the Newton's law

65
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:51,100
without the corrections due to relativity,

66
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:54,510
the correctional relativity 
which is through the Lorentz factor

67
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:56,140
which you see here in the bottom:

68
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:00,230
one divided by square root of one minus 
<i>v</i> over <i>c</i> square,

69
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:01,950
<i>c</i> being the speed of light.

70
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,700
It's a very, very small factor 
for all the common velocities

71
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,170
we have for spacecraft around the Earth 
or in the solar system.

72
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,440
We basically have velocities, or speed,

73
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:15,790
which are smaller than one thousandth 
of the speed of light.

74
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,150
So these factors are extremely small.
