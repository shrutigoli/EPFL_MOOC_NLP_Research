1
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:08,105
This is the Earth's energy budget.

2
00:00:08,686 --> 00:00:13,112
I will explain the main features
of this relatively complex diagram.

3
00:00:13,757 --> 00:00:16,470
On the upper left, 
you have the solar radiation,

4
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:19,690
the incoming solar energy,
which is the solar constant,

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:25,464
which is approximately
1368 watts per square meter.

6
00:00:25,474 --> 00:00:30,450
In fact, its value has been
slowly decreasing over the past few years

7
00:00:30,450 --> 00:00:37,591
and in April 2015, the value was
1361 watts per square meter.

8
00:00:38,247 --> 00:00:41,337
Now, as was mentioned already before,

9
00:00:41,337 --> 00:00:45,707
about 30% of this radiation
is reflected back in space

10
00:00:45,707 --> 00:00:49,086
partly by the atmosphere, by clouds
and by the Earth's surface.

11
00:00:49,335 --> 00:00:55,554
We have 20% plus 6% plus 4%,
which gives you a 30%.

12
00:00:56,076 --> 00:01:00,246
The rest is getting into land,
is absorbed by land

13
00:01:00,249 --> 00:01:06,372
and is re-radiated out in space
in the form of infrared radiation.

14
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:11,725
And you have, in fact, seen
from the outside and from the Earth,

15
00:01:11,725 --> 00:01:14,343
you have two sources
of radiation on one hand,

16
00:01:14,992 --> 00:01:18,774
the albedo, which is basically
the solar spectrum

17
00:01:18,774 --> 00:01:22,871
reflected from the high layers
of the Earth atmosphere

18
00:01:22,871 --> 00:01:25,205
and you have the infrared radiation

19
00:01:25,205 --> 00:01:30,362
because the Earth is a hot body
about 15 degrees centigrade

20
00:01:30,362 --> 00:01:33,628
on the average on surface on the planet,

21
00:01:33,628 --> 00:01:36,049
so it radiates in the far infrared.

22
00:01:37,737 --> 00:01:39,687
Now, the Earth's spectral radiance.

23
00:01:40,817 --> 00:01:46,035
This is the radiation power
that the Earth is emitting into space,

24
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:48,407
and I am not talking now
about the albedo itself,

25
00:01:48,407 --> 00:01:50,371
but the self radiation from the Earth.

26
00:01:51,045 --> 00:01:56,131
In a way, you have two components,
on one hand you have a 218 K black body

27
00:01:56,691 --> 00:02:00,905
and 218 K is corresponding
to the temperature

28
00:02:00,905 --> 00:02:03,125
of the top of the clouds,

29
00:02:03,125 --> 00:02:09,075
so the stratosphere, typically
of the order of -55 degrees centigrade

30
00:02:09,075 --> 00:02:11,102
which give you 218 K,

31
00:02:11,465 --> 00:02:15,341
and through the windows
for which the atmosphere is transparent,

32
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:17,796
we have seen our Sun 
through such windows,

33
00:02:18,294 --> 00:02:22,492
then you can see the black body
of the Earth's surface,

34
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:26,086
which is at a temperature
of approximately 15 degrees centigrade,

35
00:02:26,253 --> 00:02:30,712
or 288 K so the infrared radiation
from the Earth

36
00:02:30,712 --> 00:02:32,724
has these two components,

37
00:02:33,212 --> 00:02:35,361
the one that is absolutely steady

38
00:02:35,361 --> 00:02:37,674
is the radiation
at the top of the atmosphere,

39
00:02:37,674 --> 00:02:40,531
but again you can see
some radiation from the surface

40
00:02:40,531 --> 00:02:41,901
through these windows.

41
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:47,393
This is a table of the solar flux
and albedo for planets.

42
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:51,012
Again a value
that is really of interest for us,

43
00:02:51,012 --> 00:02:55,074
is the mean solar flux
in watt per square meter, for the Earth

44
00:02:55,074 --> 00:02:59,163
the solar constant 1368,
a little less now,

45
00:02:59,163 --> 00:03:02,545
but it has been the average value
over the last few decades

46
00:03:02,895 --> 00:03:06,246
and you see that for Mars
you have a little less

47
00:03:06,246 --> 00:03:09,526
than one half of the value
of the level of the Earth,

48
00:03:09,526 --> 00:03:13,765
which means that using solar rays
for the level of mass is fine.

49
00:03:14,097 --> 00:03:18,516
As soon as you go towards the outer part
of the solar system, Jupiter and beyond

50
00:03:18,516 --> 00:03:22,293
obviously the solar radiation
becomes very weak

51
00:03:22,293 --> 00:03:27,999
and you need to have other energy system
in a spacecraft than solar rays.

52
00:03:28,634 --> 00:03:31,436
However Rosetta still had
large solar rays,

53
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:36,473
when it encountered
planet Churyumov-Gerasimenko in 2014

54
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:40,898
and accompanied the nucleus of the comet
on its way to the Sun,

55
00:03:41,236 --> 00:03:42,751
but this is an exception.

56
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,095
It was judged as being
not the right solution

57
00:03:46,285 --> 00:03:51,630
to have thermo-electric generators
on board Rosetta,

58
00:03:51,630 --> 00:03:53,463
so it was decided
to have large solar rays.

59
00:03:53,463 --> 00:03:56,083
But, generally speaking,
when we go out in the solar system,

60
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,477
to far away distances,

61
00:03:57,477 --> 00:04:00,225
we use other power systems 
than solar rays.

62
00:04:01,066 --> 00:04:05,263
Now, you have interesting values also
of the albedo for the planet,

63
00:04:05,263 --> 00:04:10,545
we mentioned already about a third
or 0.30 for planet Earth.

64
00:04:11,025 --> 00:04:12,550
Venus has a very high albedo,

65
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:14,041
because it is covered with clouds

66
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:17,220
so it reflects a lot of the radiation
we see from the Sun.

67
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,133
On the contrary,
Mercury has a very low albedo,

68
00:04:20,133 --> 00:04:22,791
because it's a pretty dark body
like the Moon

69
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:26,482
and reflects very little
of the incoming radiation from the Sun,

70
00:04:26,482 --> 00:04:28,355
although it is very close
to the Sun obviously

71
00:04:28,355 --> 00:04:29,912
so it's a very hot planet.

72
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:36,065
The large gaseous planets have
albedo values of about 0.34.

73
00:04:36,065 --> 00:04:38,697
It's pretty much the same
for Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus,

74
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:42,224
which are very similar planets,
big giants of gas,

75
00:04:42,224 --> 00:04:44,652
mainly hydrogen and helium.
