1
00:00:05,264 --> 00:00:07,960
Let's talk about atmosphere

2
00:00:07,960 --> 00:00:10,960
and its transparency 
to various radiations.

3
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:15,831
Basically, the atmosphere is opaque
to all kind of radiations

4
00:00:15,831 --> 00:00:21,007
except a pretty large window
in the visible part of the spectrum,

5
00:00:21,007 --> 00:00:26,941
around 0.5 microns, or 5,000 angstroms.

6
00:00:27,578 --> 00:00:31,059
And of course, we have
telescopes on the ground

7
00:00:31,059 --> 00:00:35,655
observing and studying objects
in the sky in this visible window,

8
00:00:35,655 --> 00:00:39,330
which is also the window
in the electromagnetic spectrum

9
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,674
for which our eyes are sensitive.

10
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:46,013
If you go toward the infrared,
from the visible window,

11
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:48,679
you have partial transparency,

12
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:52,809
but your blockage,

13
00:00:52,809 --> 00:00:55,778
due to the presence
of molecules in the atmosphere,

14
00:00:55,778 --> 00:00:59,988
mainly the water vapor,
and the carbon dioxide, this region here.

15
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:02,410
So you could do 
some infrared astronomy from the ground,

16
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,484
but obviously it's better to go
high in the atmosphere,

17
00:01:05,484 --> 00:01:07,342
or better to go in space.

18
00:01:07,929 --> 00:01:10,379
You have the very large radio window,

19
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:12,803
which is, of course,
used with radio telescopes

20
00:01:12,803 --> 00:01:15,805
studying the object
in the large wavelengths,

21
00:01:15,805 --> 00:01:18,969
from about 1 cm to 10 m wavelengths.

22
00:01:19,401 --> 00:01:22,357
You can see that the total blockage

23
00:01:22,357 --> 00:01:25,787
in the short-wavelength region,

24
00:01:25,787 --> 00:01:29,862
typically from the ultraviolet
all the way to the X-ray and gamma rays,

25
00:01:30,962 --> 00:01:33,289
can be remedied,

26
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:36,683
if you want to study celestial objects
in this wavelength range,

27
00:01:36,683 --> 00:01:40,893
by putting a satellite,
like the Chandra X-Ray Observatory.

28
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:46,620
And for the infrared, you have one
of a few infrared observatories,

29
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,383
the Spitzer Infrared Telescope.

30
00:01:48,383 --> 00:01:51,150
The Hubble Space Telescope itself

31
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,353
is covering the visible part
of the spectrum,

32
00:01:53,353 --> 00:01:55,395
but of course being outside
of the Earth atmosphere,

33
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:57,254
it has a very high resolution;

34
00:01:57,254 --> 00:02:00,589
much better optical resolution
than ground-based telescopes,

35
00:02:00,589 --> 00:02:03,545
and it also has a small window

36
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:07,451
in the near ultraviolet
and the near infrared, as well.

37
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,340
Thickness of the atmosphere:
the atmosphere, as we have seen already,

38
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:15,869
is rather thin,
typically of the order of 100 km,

39
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,774
as far the legal definition
of the atmosphere is concerned,

40
00:02:18,774 --> 00:02:22,319
and the definition
of the beginning of space.

41
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:26,320
But of course, as we know,
there are still quite a lot of atoms,

42
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,550
mainly ionized atoms,
at much higher altitude.

43
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,211
This is a typical view,

44
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:32,671
what you see with the naked eye
when you are on low Earth orbit.

45
00:02:32,671 --> 00:02:34,676
You see the Space Shuttle in the middle,

46
00:02:34,676 --> 00:02:38,730
and you see the Earth, and you see
the very, very thin atmosphere,

47
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:40,966
which is a very, very thin blue line.

48
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:44,784
If you are during the orbital day,

49
00:02:44,784 --> 00:02:47,369
when the Sun is above the horizon
from low Earth orbits,

50
00:02:47,369 --> 00:02:49,462
typically from
the International Space Station,

51
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:51,238
the sky is completely black,

52
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:52,928
because your eyes will not be sensitive

53
00:02:52,928 --> 00:02:55,828
to the planets and the stars in the sky.

54
00:02:55,828 --> 00:02:58,190
As soon as the Sun sets,
within a very short time,

55
00:02:58,190 --> 00:03:00,719
typically about 20 seconds,

56
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:04,165
you see the stars in the sky,

57
00:03:04,165 --> 00:03:06,314
and it's a really beautiful view.

58
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,747
Now, on this picture, that was taken

59
00:03:08,747 --> 00:03:14,363
on my third Shuttle flight,
in 1996, STS-75.

60
00:03:15,175 --> 00:03:18,092
We had deployed, but not recovered,
a tethered satellite

61
00:03:18,092 --> 00:03:19,419
at the first part of the mission.

62
00:03:19,419 --> 00:03:21,384
We were ready to do
the second part of the mission

63
00:03:21,384 --> 00:03:24,629
with microgravity experiments,
onboard the Space Shuttle.

64
00:03:24,629 --> 00:03:29,786
You see, on the left-hand side,
the cargo bay of the Shuttle,

65
00:03:29,786 --> 00:03:32,855
and there are two parts in the back,
and the vertical stabilizer,

66
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:34,194
which here is horizontal,

67
00:03:34,194 --> 00:03:38,555
because we had the plane of the wings
perpendicular to the velocity vector,

68
00:03:38,555 --> 00:03:42,031
which was to the right on this picture.

69
00:03:42,031 --> 00:03:44,258
Now, what you see
is the Earth horizon, below,

70
00:03:44,258 --> 00:03:46,702
and you also see the so-called "airglow"

71
00:03:46,702 --> 00:03:50,973
which is a thin line of green light,

72
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:52,783
at about 100 km altitude,

73
00:03:52,783 --> 00:03:57,345
which is due to photoionization
of the oxygen atom,

74
00:03:57,345 --> 00:04:01,339
and de-excitation
which produces a luminescence,

75
00:04:01,339 --> 00:04:02,621
mainly due to the oxygen,

76
00:04:02,621 --> 00:04:06,047
somewhat also to nitrogen
and the radical â€¢OH.

77
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:09,670
By the way, you have,
on the right side of the picture,

78
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:12,495
the Southern Cross, 
under the two bright stars in the middle,

79
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:15,705
slightly to the right of the middle,
are Alpha and Beta Centauri.

80
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:18,794
Now, we have had a lot
of very good pictures of the Earth,

81
00:04:18,794 --> 00:04:20,506
on one hand, by night,

82
00:04:20,506 --> 00:04:23,202
and also the airglow,
which I mentioned before,

83
00:04:23,202 --> 00:04:27,665
this radiation effect at 100 km altitude
surrounding the whole Earth,

84
00:04:27,665 --> 00:04:30,771
and visible especially when you have
the Moon above the horizon.

85
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:35,461
Much better pictures taken recently
from the International Space Station,

86
00:04:35,461 --> 00:04:38,972
because of the high sensitivity
of the recording devices.

87
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:43,664
Beautiful picture,
where you see the Red Sea.

88
00:04:44,653 --> 00:04:47,762
You see Egypt on the left-hand side.

89
00:04:47,762 --> 00:04:51,129
You have the Gulf of Suez,
the Gulf of Aqaba towards Israel.

90
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:54,039
In Egypt, you have the Nile,

91
00:04:54,717 --> 00:04:58,341
and the Nile Delta
towards the Mediterranean Sea,

92
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:00,538
and you have Saudi Arabia

93
00:05:00,538 --> 00:05:03,743
on the middle to right-hand
side of the picture.

94
00:05:04,083 --> 00:05:08,724
Another nice view
of the airglow above the Earth.

95
00:05:08,724 --> 00:05:10,332
and you have the Moon
above the horizon,

96
00:05:10,332 --> 00:05:14,390
which always enhances the visibility
of the airglow from low Earth orbit.

97
00:05:14,882 --> 00:05:19,478
This is a view of Texas,
taken towards the eastern direction,

98
00:05:19,878 --> 00:05:22,657
where you have
the Gulf of Mexico on this side,

99
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:24,977
you have the city of Houston,

100
00:05:26,236 --> 00:05:28,876
Dallas, Fort Worth, and San Antonio.

101
00:05:28,876 --> 00:05:32,352
What is really interesting
on this picture is on one hand,

102
00:05:32,352 --> 00:05:34,424
the very bright nature of the airglow

103
00:05:34,424 --> 00:05:36,257
because of the presence of the Moon,

104
00:05:36,257 --> 00:05:38,543
but you also have thunderstorms

105
00:05:39,334 --> 00:05:43,012
northeast of Texas, which you see here,

106
00:05:43,012 --> 00:05:47,836
and there's a rare phenomenon
which you can distinguish here.

107
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:52,647
These are so-called "sprites,"
which are a vertical emission

108
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:56,647
of red lights above thunderstorms,
which have been seen very rarely,

109
00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:00,723
but recently we had a few recordings
from the International Space Station.

110
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:02,883
So a nice view of the Earth by night,

111
00:06:02,883 --> 00:06:06,194
with the Moon, the airglow,
and sprites over thunderstorms.
