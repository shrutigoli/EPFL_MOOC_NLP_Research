1
00:00:05,116 --> 00:00:07,897
In this section,
we'll talk about the atmosphere,

2
00:00:07,897 --> 00:00:12,595
and the slow transition
from the atmosphere to space.

3
00:00:12,595 --> 00:00:16,338
Especially the high atmosphere conditions
will be addressed here.

4
00:00:17,188 --> 00:00:19,414
First of all, let's talk about
the composition of the atmosphere.

5
00:00:19,414 --> 00:00:22,837
It's mainly nitrogen,
about 78% nitrogen,

6
00:00:22,837 --> 00:00:29,591
21% oxygen in molecule form,
1% of argon, and then we have

7
00:00:29,591 --> 00:00:34,689
a very small amount of other molecules,
mainly water vapor and carbon dioxide,

8
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:37,792
which are in fact greenhouse gases,
so they are important

9
00:00:37,792 --> 00:00:40,283
although they are small in quantity
in the atmosphere

10
00:00:40,283 --> 00:00:41,878
compared to the other components.

11
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:47,333
In this picture, we have a depiction
of the change in the temperature

12
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:51,309
of the atmosphere, and you have
on the vertical axis the pressure,

13
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:53,624
on the left-hand side, in millibars.

14
00:00:54,314 --> 00:00:56,934
On the ground, you have approximately
one thousand millibar,

15
00:00:56,934 --> 00:01:00,083
or 1013 mb to be exact.

16
00:01:00,503 --> 00:01:04,698
And on the right-hand side, you have
the altitude in kilometers and in miles.

17
00:01:05,318 --> 00:01:10,037
Now, we start, in terms of temperature
evolution as we go up in the atmosphere,

18
00:01:10,597 --> 00:01:16,663
at the level of the ground,
with a temperature of 288 K,

19
00:01:17,263 --> 00:01:20,445
or 15&deg;C.

20
00:01:20,445 --> 00:01:23,256
This is the average temperature
on the surface of the Earth.

21
00:01:23,256 --> 00:01:25,699
Then as you go through
the first layer of the atmosphere,

22
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:28,558
which is the troposphere, you have
a reduction in the temperature

23
00:01:28,558 --> 00:01:32,164
all the way to the tropopause,
the limit of the troposphere.

24
00:01:32,164 --> 00:01:39,049
And at the tropopause, approximately
nine to 11, 12, 15 km even

25
00:01:39,049 --> 00:01:42,377
above the surface of the Earth,
depending on the latitude,

26
00:01:42,377 --> 00:01:47,051
the temperature is approximately 218 K,

27
00:01:48,201 --> 00:01:51,968
or -55&deg;C.

28
00:01:51,968 --> 00:01:55,501
This is the temperature that 
you read on the display in an airliner

29
00:01:55,501 --> 00:02:01,019
when you are in the low stratosphere,
let's say 11, 12 km altitude,

30
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:03,534
going across an ocean, for instance.

31
00:02:03,534 --> 00:02:07,988
You read always the same temperature
of approximately -55&deg;C.

32
00:02:08,828 --> 00:02:12,539
As you go up, you have a pretty much
constant temperature all the way

33
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:15,585
to about 20 km altitude,
then you start to have an increase

34
00:02:15,585 --> 00:02:17,651
in temperature due to the formation

35
00:02:17,651 --> 00:02:22,804
of ozone in the layer 40-50 km altitude.

36
00:02:22,804 --> 00:02:26,081
The ozone is created by a dissociation

37
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:31,238
of the oxygen molecule O2 into two O,

38
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:34,569
and then one of the O combines
with another O2 to form ozone,

39
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:37,790
which is O3, and there is
a process of balance between

40
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:41,277
the building up of ozone
and the destruction of ozone,

41
00:02:41,277 --> 00:02:44,768
and this creates this somewhat
higher-temperature region,

42
00:02:44,768 --> 00:02:48,118
all the way to about 0&deg;C.

43
00:02:48,118 --> 00:02:51,790
As you go up in the mesosphere,
about 50 km altitude,

44
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:57,757
the temperature decreases again,
and then above 80-90 km altitude

45
00:02:57,757 --> 00:03:01,854
it starts to increase again,
because of the ionization

46
00:03:01,854 --> 00:03:05,375
of the oxygen, mainly,
and somewhat nitrogen atoms

47
00:03:05,375 --> 00:03:07,711
in the so-called thermosphere.

48
00:03:07,981 --> 00:03:12,997
So this region is really a region
of increased temperature

49
00:03:12,997 --> 00:03:15,802
because of ionization

50
00:03:17,092 --> 00:03:21,975
of O, mainly, and N atoms as well.

51
00:03:22,315 --> 00:03:25,511
Now, what is the limit of the atmosphere?

52
00:03:25,511 --> 00:03:29,693
What is considered to be
the beginning of space?

53
00:03:29,693 --> 00:03:33,045
It's considered to be at about
100 km altitude: this is what

54
00:03:33,045 --> 00:03:37,898
the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale
is considering as the limit to space,

55
00:03:37,898 --> 00:03:42,231
because they are the ones who are
recording all the records

56
00:03:42,231 --> 00:03:45,056
and the performance of either spacecraft

57
00:03:45,056 --> 00:03:47,086
or people going to a certain altitude.

58
00:03:47,086 --> 00:03:50,503
If you go above 100 km altitude,
you can be an astronaut

59
00:03:50,503 --> 00:03:53,881
because you have gone into space,
and this is really the limit

60
00:03:53,881 --> 00:04:00,046
beyond which, if you go up, you can
no longer sustain atmospheric flights,

61
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:04,362
because the lift of an airfoil
is just becoming too small.

62
00:04:04,362 --> 00:04:10,520
This is the limit between aeronautics
and astronautics: 100 km altitude.

63
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,117
Here we have a depiction of the variation
of density and pressure in the atmosphere,

64
00:04:16,117 --> 00:04:17,995
and also temperature
and speed of sound.

65
00:04:17,995 --> 00:04:22,047
As we go up in altitude, the X axis

66
00:04:22,047 --> 00:04:26,053
on the bottom shows altitude in kilometers
or in thousands of feet.

67
00:04:26,053 --> 00:04:29,922
And what is interesting is to see that
the density, of course, goes down

68
00:04:29,922 --> 00:04:33,887
as we go up, and roughly you have
the following evolution:

69
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:38,079
every time you go five and a half
kilometers higher,

70
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,021
you reduce by a factor of two the density.

71
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:46,759
You see, at 5.5 km altitude,

72
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:50,221
you have that the value
of the density is one half

73
00:04:50,221 --> 00:04:53,045
the value at sea level,
which you have represented

74
00:04:53,045 --> 00:04:57,129
on the top left of the picture,
and if you go to 11 km altitude,

75
00:04:57,829 --> 00:05:02,077
you have approximately 0.25
the value that you had at sea level,

76
00:05:02,077 --> 00:05:03,842
so, in fact, one fourth.

77
00:05:04,636 --> 00:05:07,202
You see the evolution of pressure also,
which obviously decreases,

78
00:05:07,202 --> 00:05:09,148
together with the density.

79
00:05:09,148 --> 00:05:12,284
You have the temperature decreasing,
as we have seen before,

80
00:05:12,284 --> 00:05:17,962
all the way to the tropopause, where it goes 
to about -55&deg;C.

81
00:05:17,962 --> 00:05:21,785
Then it remains constant in value
until you have the increase

82
00:05:21,785 --> 00:05:26,131
because of the formation of ozone
at 40-50 km altitude.

83
00:05:26,131 --> 00:05:28,936
The speed of sound,
being directly correlated

84
00:05:28,936 --> 00:05:33,688
with temperature, because that speed is
a function of temperature only

85
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:38,650
and not of density, goes down
as you go all the way to the tropopause,

86
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:40,497
and then it keeps the same value.

87
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:44,720
Microgravity: these are the conditions
that you have in a free fall.

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,341
If you have pure free fall,
you're going to have zero-g or weightlessness

89
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:50,798
but in fact there are always
perturbing forces.

90
00:05:50,798 --> 00:05:54,287
And the major perturbing force,
if you're in orbit around the Earth,

91
00:05:54,287 --> 00:05:56,258
even at pretty high altitude,
is going to be

92
00:05:56,258 --> 00:05:57,922
because of the atmospheric drag.

93
00:05:57,922 --> 00:06:01,049
Even at, let's say, 600 km altitude,

94
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:03,718
which is the altitude of
the Hubble Space Telescope,

95
00:06:03,718 --> 00:06:08,241
there's a small atmospheric drag,
to the point that the orbit of Hubble

96
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:10,576
is slowly, slowly decreasing
in altitude.

97
00:06:11,036 --> 00:06:15,037
So this is why we talk about microgravity
and not zero-g conditions.

98
00:06:15,037 --> 00:06:17,323
You can have other perturbing factors,

99
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:21,513
like the solar radiation pressure,

100
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:24,756
you have the flux of the particles
of the solar wind,

101
00:06:24,756 --> 00:06:28,026
which even for very high altitude
will cause somewhat of a deviation

102
00:06:28,026 --> 00:06:30,742
from a pure zero-g condition.

103
00:06:31,242 --> 00:06:36,212
Typically, on low Earth orbits, the orbit
of the International Space Station

104
00:06:36,212 --> 00:06:39,112
for instance, which is 400 km
above the Earth's surface,

105
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:43,266
you have approximately 10^-6 <i>g</i>.

106
00:06:43,266 --> 00:06:48,447
You don't have pure zero-g,
but you have one millionth of a <i>g</i>

107
00:06:48,447 --> 00:06:52,003
because of the braking force
due to the residual atmosphere.
