1
00:00:06,101 --> 00:00:12,311
Solar system exploration using rovers
or robots, landers and orbiters

2
00:00:12,424 --> 00:00:14,924
started relatively early 
in the space program

3
00:00:14,974 --> 00:00:17,749
by the United States and
by the Soviet Union.

4
00:00:17,861 --> 00:00:22,210
Already in the '60s, the early '60s,
1961, 1962,

5
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:25,410
we had the first attempt
of flybys of our neighbors,

6
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:30,376
Mars and Venus, by spacecraft
of both nations.

7
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:33,526
There was partial success there; 
not all the mission was successful,

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,131
but, still, got some early data.

9
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:42,547
In 1970, we had Venera 7 that landed
on the surface of Venus

10
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:47,448
without transmitting pictures or data,
but at least it landed there.

11
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:53,420
1971, Mariner 9 from NASA was
the first mass orbiter.

12
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:59,686
We had very successful Viking 1
and Viking 2 Mars landers in 1975,

13
00:00:59,886 --> 00:01:02,886
sending pictures of the Red Planet
quite successfully.

14
00:01:03,086 --> 00:01:08,345
1982, we had Venera 13 and 14
from the Soviet Union that landed

15
00:01:08,408 --> 00:01:12,233
on the surface of the Venus
and transmitted the first pictures

16
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:16,379
of the surface, and you see pictures
from Venera 13 on the bottom

17
00:01:16,579 --> 00:01:17,915
of the screen.

18
00:01:19,405 --> 00:01:23,692
Mars orbiters, quite a bit later,
we had Mars Express of ESA

19
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:27,070
and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter -
MRO, from NASA,

20
00:01:27,658 --> 00:01:30,314
the droid deployed in the direction
of the Red Planet

21
00:01:30,376 --> 00:01:33,576
 to launch in 2003 and 2005,
respectively.

22
00:01:34,257 --> 00:01:36,776
And we had really breathtaking
high resolution pictures

23
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:41,826
of Mars and of Phobos obtained
by both spacecrafts.

24
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:46,854
So MRO detected ice and traces
of methane

25
00:01:46,954 --> 00:01:49,838
which are possible conditions
for life on Mars.

26
00:01:50,546 --> 00:01:55,413
And even there was a detection by MRO
of flowing, salty water on Mars

27
00:01:55,510 --> 00:01:57,170
in September 2015.

28
00:01:57,894 --> 00:02:02,390
In the bottom, you have pictures
taken by MRO and Mars Express.

29
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,490
Bottom left, you have
a really nice picture

30
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:09,257
of the Victoria Crater
with some sand dunes in the bottom,

31
00:02:09,357 --> 00:02:13,689
and at the time this picture was taken,
we had the Opportunity Rover,

32
00:02:13,789 --> 00:02:20,080
also a NASA rover, on the upper left side
of the rim of the crater

33
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,050
that also took nice pictures
of this set of dunes

34
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,065
at the bottom of that crater.

35
00:02:25,165 --> 00:02:28,165
In the middle low, low parts
of the screen,

36
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:32,014
you have a nice picture of Mars Express,
taken by Mars Express.

37
00:02:32,368 --> 00:02:36,503
You see clearly that there was
flowing water or liquid water

38
00:02:36,597 --> 00:02:40,660
on the surface of Mars in the past
because these are dried lake beds.

39
00:02:41,309 --> 00:02:45,950
On the righthand side, nice picture
of Phobos, one of two satellites

40
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:52,577
of Mars, taken by Mars Express,
and you see interesting morphology

41
00:02:52,664 --> 00:02:56,864
with craters and with ridges
and lines on the surface

42
00:02:56,909 --> 00:02:58,701
which are not completely understood.

43
00:02:58,747 --> 00:03:00,434
Really interesting picture.

44
00:03:01,442 --> 00:03:05,636
Curiosity is the last
of the Mars rovers,

45
00:03:05,736 --> 00:03:10,828
NASA projects commanded and controlled
from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

46
00:03:10,878 --> 00:03:12,655
in Pasadena, California.

47
00:03:12,855 --> 00:03:16,943
You see a picture of the rover
on the lefthand side

48
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,930
and on the right, you have
the landing point

49
00:03:19,973 --> 00:03:21,220
on the surface of Mars.

50
00:03:21,885 --> 00:03:24,885
And then the track
that the rover followed

51
00:03:25,022 --> 00:03:29,472
came commanded from the ground station
in California.

52
00:03:29,895 --> 00:03:34,786
Until the end of 2015,
it had covered about ten kilometers

53
00:03:34,836 --> 00:03:36,274
of the surface of the Red Planet.

54
00:03:36,474 --> 00:03:40,396
The purpose of Curiosity was really
to analyze the materials

55
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:44,802
of the Martian surface and detect
if there were conditions in the past

56
00:03:44,915 --> 00:03:47,728
that would have allowed
the development of life.

57
00:03:48,774 --> 00:03:53,938
Exomars is a cooperation
between the European Space Agency

58
00:03:54,038 --> 00:03:58,617
and ROSCOSMOS from Russia,
the idea being to study Mars

59
00:03:58,642 --> 00:04:00,389
with several spacecraft.

60
00:04:00,489 --> 00:04:04,721
The first was a combination
of an orbiter,

61
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:10,757
the so-called "trace gas orbiter",
with the objective to detect the gases

62
00:04:10,857 --> 00:04:13,857
in the atmosphere of Mars
and the chemical composition

63
00:04:13,929 --> 00:04:15,203
of the atmosphere of Mars.

64
00:04:16,012 --> 00:04:19,017
And the other component
in this first section was a lander,

65
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:24,443
so called Schiaparelli, and the launch
was the beginning of 2016

66
00:04:24,543 --> 00:04:28,676
and the arrival at the Red Planet
was in October 2016.

67
00:04:28,776 --> 00:04:31,963
The insertion of the trace-gas orbiter
on orbit around Mars

68
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:36,708
was successful, but Schiaparelli,
the lander, impacted the surface

69
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:40,370
of Mars at too-high velocity and
was not heard from since that time.

70
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,878
So it's not a success for the lander,
but it was definitely a success

71
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:47,285
for the orbiter

72
00:04:47,385 --> 00:04:52,980
The next part of the Exomars project
should be launched in 2018

73
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:55,253
and we should have
a pretty large rover

74
00:04:55,316 --> 00:04:58,146
that will especially study
the subsurface of Mars

75
00:04:58,246 --> 00:05:04,152
with a drill or driller
that will perform holes

76
00:05:04,252 --> 00:05:07,252
on the surface of Mars
and go pretty deep under the surface

77
00:05:07,487 --> 00:05:09,308
to try to detect the presence
of ice.

78
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:14,729
India went to the moon and Mars, also,
and successfully so.

79
00:05:14,829 --> 00:05:17,174
We have on the left-hand side
Chandrayaan,

80
00:05:17,274 --> 00:05:20,865
which is the first lunar mission
launched by India.

81
00:05:20,965 --> 00:05:25,808
You see the several orbits
around the earth

82
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:28,908
before an ejection into a trajectory
to take it to the moon

83
00:05:29,108 --> 00:05:33,608
and several orbits around the moon
for scientific study of our satellite

84
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,967
and there was cooperation
of several nations

85
00:05:36,067 --> 00:05:38,834
European nations, and the US
in this project.

86
00:05:39,503 --> 00:05:42,956
On the right-hand side,
you have Mangalyaan,

87
00:05:43,156 --> 00:05:47,964
which is the first Indian mission
to Mars, departing 2013.

88
00:05:48,064 --> 00:05:51,850
Again, several orbits around the earth
before an ejection

89
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:54,950
to a haliocentric trajectory
that took it to Mars

90
00:05:55,899 --> 00:05:59,865
and insertion into Mars orbit
in September 2014.

91
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,782
The mission was terminated
from a scientific investigation

92
00:06:04,832 --> 00:06:07,757
point of view in October 2016.

93
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:13,445
The Chinese went to the moon
with a lander and a rover.

94
00:06:13,545 --> 00:06:18,938
The lander Chang'e 3 that deployed
the little rover which we see here.

95
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:24,388
For scientific investigation of the moon,
there was no plan to bring samples

96
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:26,666
of the moon back to earth.

97
00:06:26,766 --> 00:06:29,255
This is going to be a follow-on
of the project,

98
00:06:29,355 --> 00:06:32,511
at least to do a scientific
investigation of the moon's surface.

99
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:36,336
It is also a technical demonstrator
for the Chinese, quite successful.

100
00:06:36,436 --> 00:06:39,436
You see the Yutu rover here
that had a hard time

101
00:06:39,636 --> 00:06:43,622
during the first night on the moon
because the night on the moon

102
00:06:43,722 --> 00:06:47,929
lasts fourteen times, twenty-four hours,
and it is very cold

103
00:06:48,029 --> 00:06:51,541
and the Yutu rover suffered
a little bit

104
00:06:51,641 --> 00:06:54,641
from this first very cold night
and was unable to move

105
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:56,960
at the end of this night,
but since that time

106
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,395
it has recovered again.

107
00:06:59,081 --> 00:07:01,938
Cassini-Huygens.
Cassini is the NASA component,

108
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,451
Huygens the ESA component.

109
00:07:03,713 --> 00:07:06,540
launched in 1997,
and after several fly-bys,

110
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:11,341
arrived in 2004 in the vicinity
of Saturn.

111
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:15,885
The plan was really to study
the ringed planet, pretty large planet

112
00:07:15,935 --> 00:07:17,825
about eight times 
the size of the earth

113
00:07:17,925 --> 00:07:22,389
to study the rings and several
of the satellites of Saturn,

114
00:07:22,415 --> 00:07:23,682
which are really interesting.

115
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:26,179
We have the largest 
of these satellites, Titan,

116
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:29,279
that was especially studied by Huygens,
the ESA component.

117
00:07:29,368 --> 00:07:30,720
I'll talk about it in a minute.

118
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:35,051
And you see on the right-hand side,
one of the really interesting satellites

119
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:39,405
of Saturn - Enceladus,
which is covered by ice

120
00:07:39,505 --> 00:07:43,172
pretty much like Europa,
one of the satellites of Jupiter,

121
00:07:43,272 --> 00:07:46,182
and under the layer of ice
is an ocean,

122
00:07:46,282 --> 00:07:48,708
so there could have been, 
or there may be now,

123
00:07:48,808 --> 00:07:51,455
development of life
in the sub-surface

124
00:07:51,555 --> 00:07:55,875
of Enceladus, as well as Europa,
one of the satellites

125
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:57,541
of Jupiter.

126
00:07:58,408 --> 00:08:01,875
The ESA component, Huygens,
is a small spacecraft, a small lander,

127
00:08:01,975 --> 00:08:07,448
was deployed from Cassini,
because they had performed a mission

128
00:08:07,548 --> 00:08:09,111
jointly at that time.

129
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:14,008
At the end of 2004,
Huygens landed softly

130
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,820
on the surface of Titan,
which is an atmosphere.

131
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:20,577
You see the parachute
allowing the braking of the motion

132
00:08:20,677 --> 00:08:23,233
of Huygens as it gets close
to the surface.

133
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:26,358
It didn't last a long time
because of the conditions

134
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:28,449
of the surface of Titan
were quite tough

135
00:08:28,494 --> 00:08:30,925
from a chemical point of view
and temperature point of view,

136
00:08:31,025 --> 00:08:35,918
and the lifetime of Huygens
on the surface was short,

137
00:08:36,018 --> 00:08:39,451
but still it was able to transmit
some pictures, like the one you see

138
00:08:39,489 --> 00:08:40,835
on the right hand side.

139
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,068
Quite a spectacular result.

140
00:08:42,118 --> 00:08:44,236
It was the first time that
there was a landing

141
00:08:44,306 --> 00:08:49,862
on an object of the solar system
other than the surface of Venus

142
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:54,969
or of Mars, this time on the satellite
of the faraway planet Saturn.

143
00:08:55,687 --> 00:09:00,720
Hayabusa was quite a successful,
ambitious project of Japan -

144
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,727
to land a spacecraft on the surface
of an asteroid, the Itokawa asteroid

145
00:09:06,827 --> 00:09:12,486
and the landing took place in 2005
after a launch in 2003.

146
00:09:12,586 --> 00:09:16,481
The idea was to land softly
on the surface of the asteroid

147
00:09:16,581 --> 00:09:19,199
and take samples
and bring them back to Earth

148
00:09:19,299 --> 00:09:20,349
which was successful.

149
00:09:20,449 --> 00:09:23,223
Quite an ambitious project
and very successfully accomplished

150
00:09:23,323 --> 00:09:25,905
by the Japanese space agency,

151
00:09:26,105 --> 00:09:30,899
with a follow-on which is Hayabusa 2,
which has been launched in 2014,

152
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:35,857
has not accomplished its mission yet,
but we expect again great results

153
00:09:35,957 --> 00:09:38,208
from Hayabusa 2.

154
00:09:38,503 --> 00:09:44,763
Quite an interesting mission
and a really interesting result

155
00:09:44,863 --> 00:09:47,863
because if we can get samples
from objects in the solar system

156
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:51,528
like asteroids, we can
much better understand

157
00:09:51,628 --> 00:09:53,787
the whole history
of the solar system.

158
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,706
So from a scientific point of view,
it's quite an achievement.

159
00:09:58,418 --> 00:10:01,809
Rosetta was a ESA mission
to a comet.

160
00:10:01,909 --> 00:10:05,634
The launch was in March 2004

161
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:08,109
with the Arianna 5 rocket
from French Guiana.

162
00:10:09,516 --> 00:10:13,086
The trip to the comets
lasted ten years.

163
00:10:13,186 --> 00:10:15,204
The comet that was chosen
as a target

164
00:10:15,304 --> 00:10:17,839
was the comet
Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

165
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:19,838
These are the names
of the two discoverers

166
00:10:19,938 --> 00:10:22,227
of the comet from Ukraine.

167
00:10:22,882 --> 00:10:25,521
The comet was chosen
because the orbiter (INAUDIBLE)

168
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:28,621
were proper in terms
of the energy needed

169
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:31,691
and the time needed, and
it was also a good target.

170
00:10:32,472 --> 00:10:34,791
You see a very nice picture
of the comets.

171
00:10:34,991 --> 00:10:39,075
On the left-side, the comet,
at that time,

172
00:10:39,175 --> 00:10:41,525
was relatively close to the sun,
and you see already

173
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:44,894
the out-gassing of the substance
on the surface of the comet

174
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:47,994
creating the tail, which is visible
sometimes with the naked eye,

175
00:10:48,045 --> 00:10:51,660
with binoculars,
or with a telescope.

176
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,177
The object is about five kilometers
in size.

177
00:10:55,277 --> 00:10:59,319
It's a bi-lobed object,
pretty much like a bone.

178
00:10:59,419 --> 00:11:01,310
The shape was very unexpected.

179
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,410
And when the rendezvous took place,
ten years after the lift-off,

180
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:11,473
of the launcher from French Guiana
in 2014,

181
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:14,056
it was a big surprise to see
the shape of the comets

182
00:11:14,156 --> 00:11:17,156
and Rosetta came on orbit,
a very slow orbit,

183
00:11:17,356 --> 00:11:19,607
because of the low gravity
of the comet

184
00:11:19,707 --> 00:11:23,769
and, at some point, it was
in November 2014,

185
00:11:23,813 --> 00:11:28,212
a few months after the encounter,
a lander named Philae

186
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,746
was detached from Rosetta.

187
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:31,860
You see this on the right-hand side.

188
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:34,960
It approached the surface
of the comet,

189
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,551
and it was equipped with grippers
that were supposed

190
00:11:37,606 --> 00:11:39,030
 to attach it to the surface.

191
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:42,945
Unfortunately, it didn't work
and Philae bounced a couple of times

192
00:11:40,346 --> 00:11:43,346


193
00:11:42,264 --> 00:11:45,264


194
00:11:43,045 --> 00:11:46,124
and nestled itself in a ridge
which was in the shadows,

195
00:11:46,224 --> 00:11:49,969
so the lifetime of the lander
was, unfortunately, relatively short.

196
00:11:50,971 --> 00:11:53,971
The mission was terminated sometime
after the passing of the perihelion.

197
00:11:55,945 --> 00:11:59,895
We know in August 2015, when we had
the largest amount of out-gassing

198
00:11:59,957 --> 00:12:01,355
for the comet, obviously.

199
00:12:02,167 --> 00:12:06,594
Philae was found again
in September 2016

200
00:12:06,694 --> 00:12:09,224
with a high-resolution camera
from Rosetta.

201
00:12:09,261 --> 00:12:11,779
It was found in that ridge
in the shadow

202
00:12:12,154 --> 00:12:15,580
and it was understood at that time
why we had no more signal

203
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,162
from the lander after a short while

204
00:12:19,262 --> 00:12:22,400
following the first impact
on the surface of the comet.

205
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:27,359
And the mission was terminated
in September 2016,

206
00:12:27,459 --> 00:12:30,966
shortly after finding the location
of Philae

207
00:12:31,066 --> 00:12:36,640
with a planned impact of Rosetta
on the surface of the comet.

208
00:12:37,570 --> 00:12:43,334
Dawn was a NASA mission, too,
as well, an asteroid Vesta

209
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:46,254
 and to a dwarf planet Ceres.

210
00:12:46,316 --> 00:12:52,216
The launch was in 2007,
and this is the initial trajectory

211
00:12:52,316 --> 00:12:54,554
of the Dawn spacecraft.

212
00:12:54,616 --> 00:12:59,678
There was a mass gravity boost
or gravity-assist or fly-by

213
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,778
in February 2009.

214
00:13:03,425 --> 00:13:06,425
Then we had a new trajectory
with a somewhat high-energy,

215
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:11,807
allowing an arrival at Vesta,
which is in the asteroid  belt

216
00:13:11,907 --> 00:13:15,677
between Mars and Jupiter, 
in July 2011.

217
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:21,606
Then, we had a formation flying,
if I can say, of Dawn

218
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:27,832
and Vesta for a few months,
until September 2012.

219
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:32,486
At this point here, Vesta was ejected
on a trajectory

220
00:13:32,586 --> 00:13:40,283
taking it to an arrival
at dwarf planet Ceres in March 2015.

221
00:13:40,306 --> 00:13:42,233
And then there was a formation flying.

222
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:45,720
We can say orbits,
but it was more formation flight

223
00:13:45,795 --> 00:13:48,158
because of the low gravity of Ceres,

224
00:13:48,276 --> 00:13:51,230
the same for the low gravity
of Vesta,

225
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:55,500
or the low gravity of comet 
Churyumov-Gerasimenko from Rosetta.

226
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:59,440
And then there was a tracking
of Ceres for several months

227
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,390
until this point here, 
and you see on the right-hand side

228
00:14:03,427 --> 00:14:08,202
a very interesting picture of Ceres
with two bright objects on the surface

229
00:14:08,265 --> 00:14:11,946
which are not quite understood, 
but we learn a lot of things

230
00:14:11,996 --> 00:14:14,846
on such missions,
but there are also a lot of new questions

231
00:14:15,046 --> 00:14:16,621
that are coming out.

232
00:14:17,196 --> 00:14:21,246
Solar system exploration in general
is a very fruitful field

233
00:14:21,446 --> 00:14:22,602
and it's extremely interesting.

234
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:26,241
It's the opportunity to provide
huge advances

235
00:14:26,341 --> 00:14:29,944
 for the astronomical community
about objects in the solar system

236
00:14:30,044 --> 00:14:33,044
by visits in situ
these various objects

237
00:14:33,089 --> 00:14:36,751
whether they are planets
or satellites

238
00:14:36,869 --> 00:14:40,720
or asteroids or comets
or dwarf planets like Ceres.
