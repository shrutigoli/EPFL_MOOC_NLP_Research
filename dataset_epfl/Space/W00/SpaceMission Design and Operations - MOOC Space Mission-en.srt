Hello everyone!

2
00:00:01,782 --> 00:00:04,157
My name is Claude Nicollier,
and I would like to introduce

3
00:00:04,266 --> 00:00:07,591
to you my course, space
mission design and operations.

4
00:00:08,001 --> 00:00:10,814
I am a former IS astronaut,
and presently honorary

5
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:13,561
professor at the Swiss federal
institute of technology

6
00:00:13,629 --> 00:00:15,004
in Lausanne, Switzerland.

7
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:17,739
I'm also a member of
the Swiss space center

8
00:00:17,838 --> 00:00:19,813
located within the school.

9
00:00:19,962 --> 00:00:22,075
Originally trained as
an astrophysicist

10
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:26,989
and as an air-force pilot I was
selected in 1979 in the first group

11
00:00:27,097 --> 00:00:28,860
Of IS astronauts.

12
00:00:28,962 --> 00:00:31,662
I was then assigned to
the NASA Johnson's Space Center

13
00:00:31,712 --> 00:00:35,087
in Huston, Texas, and trained
on the space shuttle and it's

14
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,826
utilization for several years.

15
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:41,504
I was a crew member on four
space shuttle missions between

16
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:45,624
1992 and 1999, including
two servicing missions

17
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:49,498
to the Hubble Space Telescope
and a space walk on my last mission

18
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:52,324
to exchange some
equipment on Hubble.

19
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:56,508
My course, space mission design
and operations, is an introductory

20
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,840
course in Aerospace with an insight
into space operations.

21
00:01:00,959 --> 00:01:02,921
A significant fraction
of the course

22
00:01:03,025 --> 00:01:05,237
in particular the sections
on earth's orbits

23
00:01:05,357 --> 00:01:09,319
and rendezvous in space is based
on my experience as an astronaut.

24
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,257
In fact, it these sections I often
take astronaut training documents

25
00:01:13,345 --> 00:01:17,057
from NASA and translate
the content in engineering terms.

26
00:01:17,182 --> 00:01:20,769
Hopefully this will provide you with
a rather practical user oriented

27
00:01:20,867 --> 00:01:22,605
approach to space travel.

28
00:01:22,702 --> 00:01:24,527
The course will also
contain some parts

29
00:01:24,614 --> 00:01:28,339
outside of my field of experience,
in particular sections on

30
00:01:28,449 --> 00:01:30,924
interplanetary space missions.

31
00:01:31,025 --> 00:01:35,425
I wish I have landed on Mars or
some Asteroid, or the surface

32
00:01:35,524 --> 00:01:39,487
of a Satellite of Jupiter or Saturn,
but regrettably I have not

33
00:01:39,615 --> 00:01:41,653
and nobody has in fact so far.

34
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,720
In a not so distant future,
we will go to Mars and other

35
00:01:44,816 --> 00:01:46,666
destinations in the Solar system.

36
00:01:46,764 --> 00:01:49,764
This will be for your generation
of space travelers.

37
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:52,938
I advise you to pay attention
to the content of the chapter 

38
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:57,474
on interplanetary travel, because it
may be relevant to your future job.

39
00:01:57,595 --> 00:02:00,383
In the course I will talk about
the space environment

40
00:02:00,494 --> 00:02:04,294
we will get into astrodynamics,
then together we will engage

41
00:02:04,392 --> 00:02:08,017
on the journey to various concepts
required for the understanding

42
00:02:08,116 --> 00:02:11,116
of space travel, including
rendezvous in space

43
00:02:11,234 --> 00:02:15,122
interplanetary trajectories,
and gravity assist maneuvers.

44
00:02:15,404 --> 00:02:18,891
The course will also provide
an introduction to space propulsion 

45
00:02:18,998 --> 00:02:20,198
and space systems.

46
00:02:20,302 --> 00:02:23,527
The final sections will be about
human space flight, space shuttle

47
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:27,589
space stations and transportation
to and from stations.

48
00:02:28,209 --> 00:02:32,209
I will also address a subject
of space walking, robotics

49
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:33,917
and astronaut training.

50
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:39,202
This course is a Concept course
mainly and not too tactical.

51
00:02:39,356 --> 00:02:41,493
Do not expect, however, to just see

52
00:02:41,592 --> 00:02:43,455
a set of pretty pictures
with some comments.

53
00:02:43,536 --> 00:02:46,911
I will provide you with simple tools
that will allow you to understand

54
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:50,030
the physics and dynamics
of space travel.

55
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:53,850
I believe that this will give you
the satisfaction of potentially

56
00:02:53,944 --> 00:02:58,807
being able to not just be a witness
to space exploration, but and active

57
00:02:58,921 --> 00:03:01,371
and productive mission designer.

58
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,858
The course is at Master's level.

59
00:03:03,937 --> 00:03:05,875
The prerequisites are
a good knowledge

60
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:09,635
of basic physics and in particular
classical mechanics.

61
00:03:09,727 --> 00:03:13,490
As far as math is concerned,
some practice in vector algebra

62
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:17,971
and basic calculus are desired,
although no complex calculations

63
00:03:18,049 --> 00:03:19,711
will be performed.

64
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:21,729
Okay, dear friends and
fans of space travel!

65
00:03:21,823 --> 00:03:24,348
I look forward to embarking
on this adventure with you.

66
00:03:24,435 --> 00:03:25,835
See you soon!

67
00:03:25,906 --> 00:03:28,219
<i>Three, two, one.</i>

68
00:03:28,323 --> 00:03:31,323
<i>Zero wind lift-off!</i>
