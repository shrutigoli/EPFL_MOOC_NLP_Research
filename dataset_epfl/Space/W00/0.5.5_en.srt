1
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:07,043
Let's talk about launchers.

2
00:00:07,055 --> 00:00:12,477
In this video, there is a great variety
of launchers of different size,

3
00:00:12,478 --> 00:00:18,377
capacity, shapes, in the different
countries that have that capability,

4
00:00:18,378 --> 00:00:22,742
and we'll try to mention
all or at least most of the launchers

5
00:00:22,743 --> 00:00:25,340
which are currently used
in these countries.

6
00:00:25,341 --> 00:00:27,255
Let's start with the European launchers.

7
00:00:27,501 --> 00:00:30,541
All are launched
from Kourou, French Guiana,

8
00:00:30,542 --> 00:00:32,259
which is a European spaceport.

9
00:00:32,259 --> 00:00:35,869
Let's start from the right,
we have the Ariane 5 ECA,

10
00:00:35,870 --> 00:00:40,788
which is the last version
of the Ariane launcher family,

11
00:00:40,792 --> 00:00:45,617
built by Airbus
and exploited by Arianespace.

12
00:00:46,818 --> 00:00:50,666
Ariane 5 ECA is the most powerful
of the Ariane 5 launchers.

13
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:54,084
It has a cryogenic upper stage,

14
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:57,115
which gives it
a somewhat higher capability

15
00:00:57,115 --> 00:01:00,910
than the standard Ariane 5,
which you see here.

16
00:01:01,013 --> 00:01:03,791
There is a cryogenic middle stage:

17
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:06,890
cryogenic means
it's liquid oxygen/liquid hydrogen

18
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:09,653
in the big central segment,

19
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:14,174
and one single cryogenic
rocket engine at the bottom,

20
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,172
and two solid rocket boosters,
pretty much like the Space Shuttle,

21
00:01:17,173 --> 00:01:19,244
which are separated
after about two minutes

22
00:01:19,244 --> 00:01:21,251
and fall down in the ocean.

23
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:23,048
Now, you see the Soyuz here,

24
00:01:23,048 --> 00:01:24,925
which is not, obviously,
a European launcher,

25
00:01:24,925 --> 00:01:27,051
it's a Russian launcher,
but there is an agreement

26
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:31,083
between ESA, and CNES,
and Roscosmos

27
00:01:32,143 --> 00:01:34,829
to operate Soyuz from French Guiana.

28
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:37,749
There are some advantages,
because being close to the equator,

29
00:01:37,750 --> 00:01:41,104
you are in a better position for a launch
into the geostationary,

30
00:01:41,105 --> 00:01:43,041
or geosynchronous orbits.

31
00:01:43,042 --> 00:01:46,316
Soyuz, since a few years,
is operated from Kourou,

32
00:01:46,316 --> 00:01:49,062
and this is for a somewhat lower capacity

33
00:01:49,062 --> 00:01:52,461
in terms of mass
of the spacecraft, and Ariane 5.

34
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:57,534
Typically the Galileo
precise navigation European satellites

35
00:01:57,535 --> 00:02:00,744
are launched using Soyuz from Kourou.

36
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:05,371
And for the smaller payloads,
you have the Vega spacecraft here,

37
00:02:05,372 --> 00:02:09,627
a relatively recent development
by the European aerospace industry

38
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:12,811
for small satellites.

39
00:02:14,081 --> 00:02:17,406
All of these space vehicles have

40
00:02:17,406 --> 00:02:19,616
a further development in the future.

41
00:02:19,616 --> 00:02:22,074
Beyond Ariane 5, we'll have Ariane 6,

42
00:02:22,074 --> 00:02:26,012
which has been decided
by the European Space Agency recently

43
00:02:26,013 --> 00:02:28,262
which will be developed
over the next few years

44
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:32,502
and Vega will also be developed
into further versions.

45
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,684
Russian launchers:
You will obviously have

46
00:02:36,684 --> 00:02:40,454
the whole family of the Soyuz launchers.

47
00:02:40,454 --> 00:02:43,206
Here you have Soyuz ISS Cargo

48
00:02:43,206 --> 00:02:47,699
to send Progress into
the International Space Station.

49
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,373
You have the Soyuz ISS Manned,

50
00:02:50,373 --> 00:02:54,501
the Soyuz spacecraft
for three crew members sent to ISS.

51
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:58,263
At the current time, this is
the only way to send people to ISS

52
00:02:58,263 --> 00:03:00,883
and back to the Earth from ISS.

53
00:03:00,884 --> 00:03:04,360
And these two versions of Soyuz
are the commercial Soyuz

54
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:06,668
for launch of satellites.

55
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:10,791
We have the Zenit launcher
which is produced in Ukraine,

56
00:03:10,792 --> 00:03:12,321
by Yuzhnoye, in Ukraine,

57
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:14,611
and is mainly launched from sea platforms

58
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:18,351
with the advantage of being able
to locate the sea platform

59
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:21,003
close to the equator,
also for more efficient access

60
00:03:21,003 --> 00:03:22,993
to the geostationary orbit.

61
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,663
And last, but not least,
for the large payload,

62
00:03:27,663 --> 00:03:31,668
the Russians are operating Proton
from Baikonur in Kazakhstan.

63
00:03:32,972 --> 00:03:36,066
These are the mostly used
current US launchers:

64
00:03:36,066 --> 00:03:38,713
Delta II, on the left-hand side,

65
00:03:38,713 --> 00:03:40,999
for relatively small payloads,

66
00:03:40,999 --> 00:03:45,223
and the heavy launchers are really
Delta IV and the Atlas 5.

67
00:03:46,789 --> 00:03:49,042
You have the Space Shuttle
on the far right.

68
00:03:49,042 --> 00:03:51,072
Obviously, the Shuttle is no longer used

69
00:03:51,072 --> 00:03:53,762
but it's just a comparison of the size:

70
00:03:54,612 --> 00:03:59,352
all about the same size,
about 50-70 meters high.

71
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:03,540
And the US is equipped

72
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:07,387
with a set of very powerful
and reliable launchers.

73
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:12,502
Some of these will be used
for the launch of commercial capsules

74
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:16,535
either carrying freight or personnel
to the International Space Station

75
00:04:16,535 --> 00:04:18,212
in the future.

76
00:04:18,736 --> 00:04:22,051
Chinese launchers: these are 3 members

77
00:04:22,051 --> 00:04:25,597
of the Long March family,

78
00:04:25,597 --> 00:04:27,932
used to launch satellites, but also

79
00:04:27,932 --> 00:04:32,313
used to send people into space;

80
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,079
with the Shenzhou spacecraft;
all the Shenzhou,

81
00:04:35,079 --> 00:04:39,612
Shenzhou 8, 9, and 10,
were using one of the members

82
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:41,581
of the family of Long March.

83
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:47,100
Also, the Tiangong space station
was launched using Long March.

84
00:04:48,607 --> 00:04:50,326
Indian launchers:

85
00:04:50,326 --> 00:04:54,246
ISRO and the aerospace industry
in India have developed

86
00:04:54,246 --> 00:04:57,356
their own set of launchers
for their use,

87
00:04:57,356 --> 00:05:01,086
and mainly, you have the so-called PSLV,

88
00:05:01,086 --> 00:05:05,341
Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle,
and GSLV, geosynchronous,

89
00:05:05,341 --> 00:05:09,618
or geostationary satellite launch vehicle.

90
00:05:09,618 --> 00:05:14,334
And there is a more powerful version
of the GSLV that has been

91
00:05:14,334 --> 00:05:17,622
developed recently, the GSLV Mark 3,

92
00:05:17,622 --> 00:05:19,976
and you see, in the middle of the picture,

93
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:23,663
the launch from Satish Dhawan,

94
00:05:23,663 --> 00:05:26,462
which is the standard Indian launch site,

95
00:05:26,462 --> 00:05:29,593
north of Chennai,
on the east coast of India,

96
00:05:29,593 --> 00:05:31,963
toward the Gulf of Bengal.

97
00:05:31,963 --> 00:05:35,924
Now, all of their needs are satisfied
with their own launches in India,

98
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:39,322
either commercial satellite
or utilitarian satellite

99
00:05:39,322 --> 00:05:44,586
for either Earth observation
or navigation, or communication.

100
00:05:46,062 --> 00:05:48,461
And also, all of the science programs,

101
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:50,785
like Chandrayaan and Mangalyaan

102
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:54,942
were deployed using
the autonomous Indian launchers.

103
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:59,354
The Japanese also are mainly using
their launchers for access to space,

104
00:05:59,354 --> 00:06:02,431
whether it's for commercial satellites

105
00:06:02,431 --> 00:06:05,337
or for scientific purposes

106
00:06:05,337 --> 00:06:10,166
or also for the HTV, for deploying
the resupply vehicle

107
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:13,845
to the International Space Station
from Japan,

108
00:06:13,845 --> 00:06:17,739
and they have their family
of H-II launchers

109
00:06:17,739 --> 00:06:20,760
that are launched from Tanegashima,

110
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:23,802
from a small island
in the south part of Japan.

111
00:06:25,032 --> 00:06:28,114
This is a comparison
of selected launchers.

112
00:06:28,114 --> 00:06:31,529
What is interesting are the capacity,

113
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:35,566
the last two columns
on the right-hand side,

114
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:39,449
capacity to LEO the low-Earth orbits

115
00:06:39,449 --> 00:06:43,703
and capacity to GTO, which is
geosynchronous transfer orbit.

116
00:06:43,703 --> 00:06:46,548
Whenever you want to go
to the geosynchronous orbit,

117
00:06:46,548 --> 00:06:50,307
you have to go first to a transfer orbit
from the low-Earth orbit

118
00:06:50,307 --> 00:06:52,741
to the geosynchronous orbit;

119
00:06:52,741 --> 00:06:56,411
and whenever you want to launch
a communication satellite

120
00:06:56,411 --> 00:06:59,691
the capacity of a launcher into GTO

121
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:01,665
is a very important parameter.

122
00:07:01,665 --> 00:07:03,882
You see that for LEO,

123
00:07:03,882 --> 00:07:08,325
the highest capacity launchers can carry
a little more than 20 tons

124
00:07:08,325 --> 00:07:11,364
into low-Earth orbit,
and the capacity to GTO

125
00:07:11,364 --> 00:07:14,763
is of the order of ten times
or a little bit beyond that

126
00:07:14,763 --> 00:07:16,693
for the Delta IV.

127
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:18,846
Now, since a few years,

128
00:07:18,846 --> 00:07:22,316
private companies are also
providing launch services

129
00:07:22,316 --> 00:07:25,416
for commercial customers or for NASA,

130
00:07:25,416 --> 00:07:28,541
or resupply
to the International Space Station

131
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:31,605
for freights; this has been done,
so far successfully,

132
00:07:31,605 --> 00:07:33,239
by some companies,

133
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:35,639
and in the future, for personnel.

134
00:07:36,099 --> 00:07:40,963
There will be a possibility
from probably 2017

135
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,078
to bring personnel,
astronauts and cosmonauts

136
00:07:45,078 --> 00:07:48,187
to the International Space Station
from US soil,

137
00:07:48,187 --> 00:07:51,257
using these commercial launch system
and capsules.

138
00:07:52,327 --> 00:07:56,591
Now, on the far left, we have SpaceX,

139
00:07:56,591 --> 00:07:59,235
quite a successful and active company,

140
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:02,140
providing the Falcon 9 launcher.

141
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:07,388
And the two versions
on the right-hand side here

142
00:08:07,388 --> 00:08:10,268
are for commercial purposes
to launch satellites

143
00:08:10,268 --> 00:08:12,264
of various sizes and weights.

144
00:08:12,264 --> 00:08:16,842
And on the left-hand side
you have Falcon 9

145
00:08:16,842 --> 00:08:20,222
with the Dragon capsule
resupply of freight

146
00:08:20,222 --> 00:08:21,661
to the International Space Station,

147
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:25,798
successfully accomplished
a few times in the last few years.

148
00:08:25,798 --> 00:08:28,353
And in the future, again, from 2017 on,

149
00:08:28,353 --> 00:08:33,683
we'll have a manned version
of the Dragon capsule;

150
00:08:34,463 --> 00:08:39,029
the manned Dragon that will be able
to supply up to 4 people at a time

151
00:08:39,029 --> 00:08:42,015
to the International Space Station
from US soil.

152
00:08:42,615 --> 00:08:46,841
Now, as far as the companies
selected by NASA to resupply

153
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:50,207
the International Space Station
in personnel,

154
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:53,394
we have two other companies
that have been selected:

155
00:08:53,394 --> 00:08:58,144
we have Boeing,
with the Boeing CST-100 capsule,

156
00:08:58,144 --> 00:09:01,855
and more recently we have
the Dream Chaser,

157
00:09:01,855 --> 00:09:03,501
of Sierra Nevada Corporation,

158
00:09:03,501 --> 00:09:06,410
which is a winged vehicle,
pretty much like the Space Shuttle

159
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:10,705
that will be able to land on the runway
at the completion of the mission.

160
00:09:10,705 --> 00:09:13,693
So these three: Dragon from SpaceX,

161
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:16,858
Boeing CST-100 from Boeing,

162
00:09:16,858 --> 00:09:19,682
and Dream Chaser from
Sierra Nevada Corporation

163
00:09:19,682 --> 00:09:23,432
to resupply the Space Station
in personnel in the future.

164
00:09:23,432 --> 00:09:26,409
Now, we have Orbital Corporation

165
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:31,095
which is operating the Antares rocket
on the far-right side,

166
00:09:31,095 --> 00:09:33,607
with a Cygnus spacecraft on the top,

167
00:09:33,607 --> 00:09:37,357
able to resupply freight
to the International Space Station.

168
00:09:37,357 --> 00:09:40,826
We have had a few
successful flights so far

169
00:09:40,826 --> 00:09:43,235
and hopefully, in the future,
it will continue.

170
00:09:43,805 --> 00:09:46,333
Major spaceports: I don't pretend
to mention them all,

171
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,428
but I will show the major ones

172
00:09:49,428 --> 00:09:51,932
in the various space-faring nations.

173
00:09:51,932 --> 00:09:56,074
In the US, we have obviously
Cape Canaveral, Florida,

174
00:09:56,074 --> 00:09:59,665
and this is for launches in this sector,

175
00:09:59,665 --> 00:10:03,021
which means mainly to the east,
and to the northeast.

176
00:10:03,021 --> 00:10:05,547
Typically the launches 
to the International Space Station,

177
00:10:05,547 --> 00:10:08,136
with an inclination of 51.6 degrees

178
00:10:08,136 --> 00:10:11,709
are fine from Cape Canaveral,
or Kennedy Space Center, for that matter,

179
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:15,465
Kennedy Space Center being
the specific NASA launch site

180
00:10:15,465 --> 00:10:17,545
located at Cape Canaveral.

181
00:10:17,545 --> 00:10:19,849
Now, we have a launch site in the US

182
00:10:19,849 --> 00:10:23,581
on the west coast, Vandenberg,

183
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:26,072
and this is for the launches
in this region,

184
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:28,785
which means if you want to go
to a polar orbit,

185
00:10:28,785 --> 00:10:31,511
or to a sun synchronous orbit,
we'll see that later,

186
00:10:31,511 --> 00:10:34,189
this is close to a polar orbit,
you do it from Vandenberg,

187
00:10:34,189 --> 00:10:36,096
and not from Cape Canaveral.

188
00:10:37,266 --> 00:10:40,822
Kourou, French Guiana,
which is the European spaceport,

189
00:10:40,822 --> 00:10:42,134
is located here.

190
00:10:42,134 --> 00:10:45,748
Also has a large expanse to the east

191
00:10:45,748 --> 00:10:48,108
over the Atlantic Ocean,

192
00:10:48,108 --> 00:10:51,287
and relatively close to the equator,
the Equator is here,

193
00:10:51,287 --> 00:10:54,258
and the latitude of Kourou
is a little less than 6 degrees

194
00:10:54,258 --> 00:10:56,948
which is favorable for the launches

195
00:10:56,948 --> 00:11:00,668
with a destination geostationary orbit.

196
00:11:02,548 --> 00:11:03,559
Let's go to Russia.

197
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:07,952
We have Baikonur and Plesetsk,
which is far north,

198
00:11:07,952 --> 00:11:12,350
and in the future, we'll have
the launch site located

199
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:16,774
on the east side of Russia, Vostochny.

200
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:19,978
As far as Japan is concerned,

201
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:24,642
we have Tanegashima, which is
in the south part of Japan

202
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:26,660
on a small island.

203
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:32,290
For India, we have Satish Dhawan,

204
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:36,970
as mentioned already,
just north of Chennai,

205
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:41,423
with the Gulf of Bengal
open on the east side,

206
00:11:41,423 --> 00:11:43,490
which is favorable for launches.

207
00:11:44,278 --> 00:11:45,819
As far as China is concerned,

208
00:11:45,819 --> 00:11:49,269
we have several launch sites
distributed over the whole country.
