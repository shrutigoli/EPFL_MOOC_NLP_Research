1
00:00:06,179 --> 00:00:10,997
This is a nice medieval drawing
showing one of the very important aspects

2
00:00:10,997 --> 00:00:13,928
of why we go into space.

3
00:00:13,928 --> 00:00:17,005
We see this gentleman who is going
through the celestial sphere

4
00:00:17,005 --> 00:00:19,582
and he is looking at the mechanism

5
00:00:19,582 --> 00:00:22,966
that can explain the motion 
of planets and stars.

6
00:00:22,966 --> 00:00:26,639
This is really the spirit 
of space exploration.

7
00:00:26,639 --> 00:00:29,860
We go there because it gives us  
a vantage point

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,054
to much better understand 
celestial object.

9
00:00:33,054 --> 00:00:35,254
The Hubble Space Telescope
is a good example.

10
00:00:35,254 --> 00:00:39,228
We put that telescope in space 
because it gives us a much better,

11
00:00:39,228 --> 00:00:41,862
much more precise view of the universe,

12
00:00:41,862 --> 00:00:44,862
and if we observe the sky 
from the ground,

13
00:00:44,862 --> 00:00:46,681
with ground base telescopes.

14
00:00:46,681 --> 00:00:51,168
So exploration and satisfaction 
about curiosity about the world.

15
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:55,810
One other very important aspect 
of space exploration

16
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,386
is looking at the Earth itself.

17
00:00:58,386 --> 00:01:00,776
We want to understand planet Earth.

18
00:01:00,776 --> 00:01:05,458
That’s where life has developed
since billions of years,

19
00:01:05,458 --> 00:01:11,167
and hopefully is going to be a habitat
for living creatures, including humans,

20
00:01:11,167 --> 00:01:13,234
for a long time in the future.

21
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:16,155
We want to understand the Earth.

22
00:01:16,155 --> 00:01:19,216
A lot of the space missions
have their instruments

23
00:01:19,216 --> 00:01:20,957
directed towards the Earth.

24
00:01:20,957 --> 00:01:24,317
There is even a program at NASA 
called <i>Mission to Planet Earth</i>.

25
00:01:24,317 --> 00:01:26,780
Is a space mission 
but looking at planet Earth.

26
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:30,184
We want to understand our neighbors here.

27
00:01:30,184 --> 00:01:35,753
You see here an old map of the Earth.

28
00:01:35,753 --> 00:01:37,773
Obviously if we observe the Earth 
from space,

29
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:42,412
we can, because we see it globally,
we can have a very good idea

30
00:01:43,262 --> 00:01:47,759
about the distribution of land masses, 
and the quality of land masses.

31
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,549
And we can use it for much better 
exploiting the resources of planet Earth.

32
00:01:53,169 --> 00:01:58,382
Here you have an old map 
of the planet Mars.

33
00:01:58,382 --> 00:02:01,955
Since the beginning of the space age, 
where we’ve explored our neighbors

34
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:04,087
were we’ve explored the Moon,

35
00:02:04,087 --> 00:02:07,097
we’ve gone to Mars also 
with various spaceships.

36
00:02:08,647 --> 00:02:11,183
Exploring our neighbors,
understanding our neighbors,

37
00:02:11,183 --> 00:02:14,313
and doing so-called 
comparative planetology,

38
00:02:14,313 --> 00:02:16,820
will help us better understand the Earth.

39
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,853
Understanding Venus, 
understanding Mars

40
00:02:18,853 --> 00:02:22,926
will help us better understand the Earth
and using the Earth in the future.

41
00:02:24,156 --> 00:02:25,812
Now we go into space also,

42
00:02:25,812 --> 00:02:28,920
and install all kinds of spacecraft 
for practical purposes,

43
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,523
and the main practical applications 
of space, are obviously telecommunication,

44
00:02:33,523 --> 00:02:37,763
precise navigation, like the GPS system,
with the equivalent system in Europe,

45
00:02:37,763 --> 00:02:41,020
in Russia, in China, and more to come.

46
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:46,953
We also have the observation of the Earth 
to better utilize its resources,

47
00:02:46,953 --> 00:02:49,217
and observation of the weather systems.

48
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:50,709
This is a good example here.

49
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:55,842
This is a pretty bad hurricane 
in 2005, Katrina,

50
00:02:55,852 --> 00:03:01,080
which is one of the strongest hurricanes
to enter the Gulf of Mexico,

51
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,772
and did a lot of damage in New Orleans, 
which is about located here,

52
00:03:05,772 --> 00:03:08,995
and this is the eye of this hurricane.

53
00:03:08,995 --> 00:03:11,518
So, we can, on one hand,
much better understand

54
00:03:11,518 --> 00:03:15,312
hurricane path and processes,

55
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:18,976
and we can also order 
evacuations on time,

56
00:03:18,976 --> 00:03:23,864
in order to prevent loss of life 
or loss of properties on Earth.

57
00:03:23,864 --> 00:03:26,674
So the practical aspect of space,

58
00:03:26,674 --> 00:03:30,516
I wouldn’t say exploration,
but utilization, is quite important.

59
00:03:31,286 --> 00:03:35,009
Last but not least, we have a lot of 
spin-off from the space program.

60
00:03:35,009 --> 00:03:37,060
The Apollo program is a good example.

61
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:41,475
This is Apollo 11 with the astronaut 
Aldrin close to the lunar module,

62
00:03:41,475 --> 00:03:46,564
and on the side of Aldrin 
we have one experiment,

63
00:03:46,564 --> 00:03:48,648
a Swiss experiment that
had as an objective

64
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:51,445
to capture the particles 
of the solar wind.

65
00:03:53,115 --> 00:03:56,353
There are a lot of spin-offs in the sense 
that we develop technology.

66
00:03:56,353 --> 00:03:59,014
It’s a very harsh environment, 
it’s very challenging.

67
00:03:59,014 --> 00:04:02,170
We have to develop systems
that are very reliable,

68
00:04:02,170 --> 00:04:07,061
that function well, including 
in very difficult conditions,

69
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:12,051
with solar radiation, with ultraviolet,
with cosmic rays.

70
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,130
It's very challenging,
so it’s pushing the technology,

71
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:18,833
and these progresses in technology 
can be then used on the Earth,

72
00:04:18,833 --> 00:04:21,353
and this is a spin-off,
and numerous spin-offs

73
00:04:21,353 --> 00:04:26,244
in materials, in electronics system,
and reliable MEMS component.

74
00:04:26,244 --> 00:04:32,793
This is a huge side benefit 
of human and automatic space exploration.
