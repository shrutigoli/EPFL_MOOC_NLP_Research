1
00:00:06,099 --> 00:00:08,774
After the successful flight
of Yuri Gagarin on

2
00:00:08,974 --> 00:00:13,337
April 12, 1961 success
by the Soviets.

3
00:00:13,764 --> 00:00:17,476
In the cold war climate between
the United States

4
00:00:17,676 --> 00:00:20,876
and the Soviet Union, obviously
the Americans had to react.

5
00:00:21,076 --> 00:00:24,076
And there was a decision taken
rather rapidly

6
00:00:24,276 --> 00:00:26,451
after the successful flight 
of Gagarin,

7
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:28,951
for the Americans to go to the moon.

8
00:00:29,387 --> 00:00:33,099
And there was a talk by
President Kennedy

9
00:00:33,542 --> 00:00:37,780
at a joint session of congress
on May 25, 1961

10
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,980
which means only a short time
after the flight of Gagarin.

11
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:45,181
The decision to go to the moon.
There was of course, consultation,

12
00:00:45,381 --> 00:00:47,444
with the experts of...

13
00:00:49,016 --> 00:00:51,953
space travel in United States,
and the industry.

14
00:00:52,153 --> 00:00:54,978
And it was realized that
it was something that was possible.

15
00:00:55,178 --> 00:00:57,578
It was going to cost a lot of money,
but it was possible.

16
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,092
And the decision was made.

17
00:01:01,774 --> 00:01:06,474
There was some time that happened
between this decision

18
00:01:06,674 --> 00:01:10,024
at the political level until
there was a public announcement

19
00:01:10,224 --> 00:01:12,949
of this decision to go to the moon.
We had...

20
00:01:13,326 --> 00:01:16,501
at Rice University, rather well
known University 

21
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:20,677
in Houston in September, 1962.

22
00:01:20,989 --> 00:01:24,464
The famous words of President Kennedy.
We choose to go to the moon.

23
00:01:24,953 --> 00:01:28,378
We choose to go to the Moon in 
this decade and do the other things,

24
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,496
not because they are easy,
but because they are hard,

25
00:01:31,696 --> 00:01:35,934
because that goal will serve to organize
the best of our energies and skills,

26
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,730
because that challenge is one
that we are willing to accept,

27
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,184
one that we are unwilling 
to postpone,

28
00:01:42,384 --> 00:01:45,459
and one which we intend to win,
and the others too.

29
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:48,607
These were very strong words,
and there's no doubt that

30
00:01:49,964 --> 00:01:53,602
the enormous will that there was
for Americans to be successful

31
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:56,214
in this next step of space
exploration,

32
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:59,414
and to beat the Soviet Union
in that respect.

33
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,727
And also, the fact that it was 
so hard that had as a consequence

34
00:02:03,964 --> 00:02:07,240
to really focus the energies 
and talents available in the US

35
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:12,264
to lead to a successful 
achievement of this program.

36
00:02:14,037 --> 00:02:19,699
This is a picture illustrating
the hardware used by the US

37
00:02:20,014 --> 00:02:24,002
for human space flights and eventually
leading to the Apollo program.

38
00:02:24,406 --> 00:02:27,044
First of all, you have 
the Mercury capsule here.

39
00:02:29,957 --> 00:02:34,270
That was used for the very first
space flight of an American, Shepard

40
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:37,858
in May,1961.

41
00:02:38,083 --> 00:02:41,759
So a few weeks only after the flight
of Gagarin, but only achieving

42
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:45,771
suborbital condition with 
the Redstone rocket.

43
00:02:46,663 --> 00:02:49,738
Later, the same capsule
was used by John Glenn

44
00:02:50,165 --> 00:02:54,177
to achieve orbit on top
of the Atlas rocket

45
00:02:54,402 --> 00:02:57,015
which you see here, which
had the capability to

46
00:02:57,838 --> 00:03:01,363
reach the orbital stage not only
suborbital like was the case

47
00:03:01,563 --> 00:03:02,688
for the Redstone rocket.

48
00:03:03,289 --> 00:03:05,339
This is the Atlas.

49
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:09,899
And after the decision of
developing the

50
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:16,049
hardware and also all the equipment
needed for the moon program,

51
00:03:17,181 --> 00:03:20,356
the American developed 
a so called Gemini program

52
00:03:20,556 --> 00:03:23,431
respective of the Gemini
capsule which you see here

53
00:03:26,198 --> 00:03:29,885
for 2 crew members on top of

54
00:03:30,566 --> 00:03:34,041
a more powerful rocket than Atlas
which was the Titan rocket.

55
00:03:35,622 --> 00:03:38,397
And the purpose of 
the Gemini program was

56
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:41,596
developed from a 
hardware point of view

57
00:03:41,796 --> 00:03:43,309
and also operational point of view.

58
00:03:43,509 --> 00:03:45,759
Some of the capabilities needed
for the Apollo program

59
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:48,959
which were space walking
on one hand, and

60
00:03:49,159 --> 00:03:50,809
a rendezvous in space.

61
00:03:51,234 --> 00:03:54,509
On top, you have the hardware 
that was specifically used

62
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,521
for the Apollo program,
for the Moon program.

63
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:03,197
You have the command module,

64
00:04:04,610 --> 00:04:06,660
the service module,

65
00:04:07,281 --> 00:04:10,919
of the Apollo capsule, and
in here, you have the lunar module

66
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,965
which is the part that was going
to land on the moon.

67
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:17,943
And the complex,

68
00:04:18,588 --> 00:04:22,563
command module, service module,
lunar module, was put

69
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:25,931
on top of the Saturn 5 rocket

70
00:04:26,131 --> 00:04:29,306
which was developed specifically
or the moon program.

71
00:04:29,506 --> 00:04:32,994
Very large, and very powerful
rocket Saturn 5

72
00:04:36,517 --> 00:04:39,555
which was in fact the baby
of von Braun.

73
00:04:41,655 --> 00:04:44,967
Quite a remarkable achievement and
also the most challenging part 

74
00:04:45,167 --> 00:04:45,967
of the Apollo program,

75
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,855
the development and operation
of the Saturn 5 rocket.

76
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,590
Now on this picture you have
the whole scenario

77
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,002
of an Apollo mission.

78
00:04:58,362 --> 00:05:01,337
It was the same scenario that
was used from Apollo 11,

79
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:05,975
the first landing on the moon
in December, 1969,

80
00:05:06,175 --> 00:05:09,737
until Apollo 17. The last one
in December, 1972.

81
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:14,199
You basically had a launch from
Kennedy Space Center, Florida.

82
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:17,036
You had initially earth 
parking orbit

83
00:05:18,366 --> 00:05:20,903
of the Apollo spacecraft
which meant command module,

84
00:05:21,103 --> 00:05:24,628
service module, the lunar module,
and also the upper stage of the rocket

85
00:05:24,828 --> 00:05:29,591
that was used in order to perform 
the so called Translunar injection,

86
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:33,241
the TLI at some point on 
this parking orbit

87
00:05:33,441 --> 00:05:36,441
in order to inject the complex

88
00:05:37,143 --> 00:05:38,918
on a trajectory toward the moon.

89
00:05:39,118 --> 00:05:42,943
There was a separation of
the upper stage

90
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:45,518
of the Saturn 5 rocket
which eventually

91
00:05:45,908 --> 00:05:49,371
went into a solar orbit
that was not used anymore

92
00:05:49,608 --> 00:05:52,108
after this delta (INAUDIBLE)

93
00:05:52,308 --> 00:05:54,208
this maneuver was performed .

94
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:58,696
Then you have the spacecraft
made of the command service module

95
00:05:58,896 --> 00:06:00,246
and the lunar module

96
00:06:03,472 --> 00:06:05,210
in the direction of the moon.

97
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:08,853
Initially when the launch took place,
the moon was there.

98
00:06:09,956 --> 00:06:13,144
And the idea was to come and
(INAUDIBLE) the motion of the moon

99
00:06:13,563 --> 00:06:17,088
because of the gravitational attraction
of the moon, you had a curvature

100
00:06:17,288 --> 00:06:20,075
of the trajectory, and there was
a maneuver that was necessary.

101
00:06:20,275 --> 00:06:23,150
Which is basically 
a braking maneuver

102
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,238
in order to insert the complex
service module,

103
00:06:27,438 --> 00:06:31,000
command module, lunar module,
on lunar orbit.

104
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:34,200
A (INAUDIBLE) lunar orbit
which eventually was

105
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,563
circularized as you see here.

106
00:06:37,012 --> 00:06:40,049
Then the whole operation of the
separation of the lunar module

107
00:06:40,249 --> 00:06:43,249
after 2 crew members
went into it.

108
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:46,038
Braking maneuver, 
landing on the moon,

109
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:50,257
surface operation on the moon
by 2 crew members.

110
00:06:51,371 --> 00:06:56,009
Then, lift off from the moon surface
of the upper stage of the lunar module

111
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:58,842
rendezvous with the command
and service module where

112
00:06:59,042 --> 00:07:01,430
one crew member had been left.

113
00:07:02,298 --> 00:07:04,773
And then there was a jettison
of the lunar module

114
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:07,848
which was no longer needed and 
crashed on the surface of the moon.

115
00:07:08,048 --> 00:07:10,986
At some point, transearth injection

116
00:07:11,186 --> 00:07:14,373
with only command and service module,
3 crew members,

117
00:07:14,906 --> 00:07:18,631
and you see here, this trajectory
backed towards the earth.

118
00:07:18,998 --> 00:07:22,048
Command module, service module
separation is taking place here

119
00:07:22,223 --> 00:07:26,023
and we had the entry and the landing
in the Pacific Ocean

120
00:07:26,223 --> 00:07:28,073
of the command module only

121
00:07:28,261 --> 00:07:30,123
and 3 crew members on board.

122
00:07:31,407 --> 00:07:34,931
Well here we see a beautiful 
picture taken 

123
00:07:35,131 --> 00:07:37,832
on several of the Apollo missions.

124
00:07:38,032 --> 00:07:40,382
Starting with Apollo 8, which

125
00:07:40,881 --> 00:07:43,468
in December, 1968 already

126
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:45,443
a few months before the first
landing on the moon.

127
00:07:45,643 --> 00:07:48,181
It went all the way to the moon,
and on orbit around the moon.

128
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:51,133
Then we had Apollo 10
a few months later

129
00:07:51,333 --> 00:07:53,920
which is a rehearsal of the landing
on the moon.

130
00:07:54,095 --> 00:07:56,558
But without the landing itself
on the moon.

131
00:07:57,925 --> 00:08:03,288
Then, everything was ready for 
the first landing in December, 1969

132
00:08:03,488 --> 00:08:04,975
Apollo 11.

133
00:08:05,992 --> 00:08:09,055
Here we have the 3 crew members
that were selected

134
00:08:09,255 --> 00:08:10,955
for the first landing
on the moon.

135
00:08:11,445 --> 00:08:14,870
Neil Armstrong, on the left hand side
was the commander of the mission.

136
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:18,257
We had Buzz Aldrin on the right
hand side was the pilot

137
00:08:18,457 --> 00:08:20,245
of the lunar module.
In the middle,

138
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,941
we have Mike Collins who
was going to be,

139
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:25,628
who eventually was the

140
00:08:27,068 --> 00:08:29,455
crew member that was going 
to stay on orbit

141
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:32,393
around the moon in the command
and service module.

142
00:08:33,635 --> 00:08:36,647
Okay, I'm going to show you
a short video clip

143
00:08:36,847 --> 00:08:40,472
of the landing of the Eagle,

144
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:45,272
the lunar module with Neil Armstrong
and Buzz Aldrin on board

145
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:49,995
from some time after the separation
from the command and service module

146
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:52,907
where Mike Collins stayed

147
00:08:53,354 --> 00:08:56,104
during the surface operation of
the moon by his 2 colleagues

148
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:58,767
and you'll see the descent
of the lunar module

149
00:08:58,967 --> 00:09:01,517
towards the surface of the moon.
Then the slow transition

150
00:09:01,717 --> 00:09:04,479
from orbital motion
to a powered descent

151
00:09:04,679 --> 00:09:06,067
of the first surface of the moon.

152
00:09:06,481 --> 00:09:09,781
You see at some point
the roll maneuver

153
00:09:10,186 --> 00:09:12,899
that is necessary because
of the pitch down

154
00:09:13,099 --> 00:09:15,261
of the lunar module in
order to be ready for

155
00:09:15,822 --> 00:09:18,447
being at a proper altitude
or orientation

156
00:09:18,647 --> 00:09:20,810
for touching the surface
of the moon.

157
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:24,191
Then you'll see the final approach
seen from the window

158
00:09:25,701 --> 00:09:28,114
of the lunar module

159
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,919
with obviously Neil Armstrong
and Buzz Aldrin looking

160
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:35,082
carefully at the possible
obstacles on the path.

161
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:40,044
In fact they had to avoid a crater
and land on a relatively smooth region

162
00:09:40,244 --> 00:09:42,182
of the sea of tranquility.

163
00:09:42,543 --> 00:09:44,455
At some point you'll hear
60 seconds

164
00:09:44,655 --> 00:09:47,393
and that's a call from
the ground team

165
00:09:47,593 --> 00:09:50,355
which meant they only had 1 minute
of fuel remaining

166
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:52,730
in the powered descent
to the surface of the moon.

167
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:55,118
At some point you'll hear
30 seconds only,

168
00:09:55,318 --> 00:09:56,930
they have half a minute
remaining.

169
00:09:57,130 --> 00:10:00,130
Shortly afterward you'll see 
the shadow of the probe.

170
00:10:00,548 --> 00:10:03,198
The (INAUDIBLE) which the surface
of the moon

171
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:06,381
commanding a shutdown
of the engine.

172
00:10:06,593 --> 00:10:10,506
You have the landing, and you have
the famous words of Neil Armstrong

173
00:10:10,706 --> 00:10:12,543
which you will hear.
And then the reaction

174
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:15,281
of the personnel in the control
room in Houston.

175
00:10:15,481 --> 00:10:18,818
That's a very special,
very emotional video,

176
00:10:19,018 --> 00:10:22,018
and it's a great moment of 
the history of human space flight.

177
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:26,322
Eagle, Houston. We read you now. 
You're Go for PDI. Over.

178
00:10:27,588 --> 00:10:29,338
Roger. Understand. 

179
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:35,142
Got the Earth straight 
out our front window.

180
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:45,805
50,000 feet above the moon.

181
00:10:46,005 --> 00:10:48,167
Eagles descend engine ignited

182
00:10:48,367 --> 00:10:50,930
and began the deceleration 
for landing.

183
00:10:51,912 --> 00:10:53,175
As they descended,

184
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,662
Armstrong and Aldrin watched
the craters and mountains of the moon

185
00:10:57,202 --> 00:10:58,714
as beneath them.

186
00:11:03,254 --> 00:11:05,316
Eagle, Houston. 
You're Go for landing. Over.

187
00:11:09,389 --> 00:11:11,251
Roger. Understand. Go for landing.

188
00:11:26,231 --> 00:11:29,206
At this point, the Eagle rolled
on to its back.

189
00:11:29,554 --> 00:11:32,354
to give the landing radar
surface acquisition.

190
00:11:33,165 --> 00:11:35,577
Now the crew was flying blind.

191
00:11:35,977 --> 00:11:38,202
Hurtling towards the lunar surface.

192
00:11:38,402 --> 00:11:41,465
Only their instruments and the voice
of mission control

193
00:11:41,949 --> 00:11:43,736
telling them where they were

194
00:11:43,936 --> 00:11:48,449
until a slow pitch maneuver brought
the lunar horizon to their view.

195
00:11:51,333 --> 00:11:54,121
100 feet, 3 and a half down, 
9 forward.

196
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:56,477
Five percent.

197
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,695
Quantity light.

198
00:12:00,962 --> 00:12:02,412
Okay. 75 feet.

199
00:12:02,612 --> 00:12:04,412
And it's looking good. Down a half,

200
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,404
6 forward.

201
00:12:08,313 --> 00:12:10,025
60 seconds.

202
00:12:10,338 --> 00:12:11,575
Light's on.

203
00:12:12,198 --> 00:12:12,835
60 feet.

204
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:16,145
Down 2 and a half.

205
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,758
2 forward. 2 forward.

206
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:23,292
That's good.

207
00:12:23,907 --> 00:12:25,632
40 feet, down 2 and a half.

208
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:29,942
30 feet, 2 and a half down.

209
00:12:30,142 --> 00:12:33,142
(INAUDIBLE) shadow.
4 forward. 

210
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,908
4 forward. 
Drifting to the right a little

211
00:12:36,108 --> 00:12:37,908
20 feet, down a half.

212
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:39,858
30 seconds.

213
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:41,870
Picking up some dust.

214
00:12:45,530 --> 00:12:47,780
(INAUDIBLE)

215
00:12:49,297 --> 00:12:50,935
Contact Light.

216
00:12:52,721 --> 00:12:54,808
Okay. Engine Stop.

217
00:12:55,546 --> 00:12:57,533
We copy you down, Eagle.

218
00:12:57,912 --> 00:13:01,187
Houston, Tranquility Base here. 

219
00:13:01,387 --> 00:13:02,900
The Eagle has landed.

220
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:06,075
Roger, Tranquility.
We copy you on the ground.

221
00:13:06,275 --> 00:13:08,162
You got a bunch of guys 
about to turn blue.

222
00:13:08,362 --> 00:13:10,275
We're breathing again. Thanks a lot.

223
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,303
Here you see the landing
module

224
00:13:16,761 --> 00:13:20,436
Eagle after it's landing
on the surface of the moon.

225
00:13:20,636 --> 00:13:23,424
You see the lower stage.

226
00:13:23,624 --> 00:13:26,136
Including the rocket motor that
was used once again

227
00:13:26,336 --> 00:13:28,861
to transform the orbital
motion close to the moon

228
00:13:29,086 --> 00:13:30,549
to a powered descent.

229
00:13:30,749 --> 00:13:33,599
And this is the so called
upper stage of the lunar module

230
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:36,324
that was used to lift off
from the surface of the moon

231
00:13:36,524 --> 00:13:38,024
with 2 crew members on board

232
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:40,661
and perform a rendezvous with
the command and service module

233
00:13:40,861 --> 00:13:42,336
on lunar orbit.

234
00:13:43,496 --> 00:13:45,609
A nice picture of Buzz Aldrin

235
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:47,396
the second man to walk
on the moon.

236
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:49,684
Picture taken by Neil Armstrong.

237
00:13:49,884 --> 00:13:51,696
This is a mythical picture.

238
00:13:51,971 --> 00:13:54,896
A very strong impression of this
wonderful achievement.

239
00:13:55,223 --> 00:13:58,298
The Apollo program, the Apollo 11
mission in particular.

240
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:05,480
From mission Apollo 15 on,

241
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,405
of course we had Apollo 11
which we talked about.

242
00:14:08,605 --> 00:14:11,455
12 which was successful,
13 which

243
00:14:11,655 --> 00:14:14,367
because of the huge problem we had
on the way to the moon

244
00:14:14,567 --> 00:14:17,567
with the explosion of the oxygen tank 
could not reach the surface of the moon

245
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,217
but the crew was saved.

246
00:14:21,158 --> 00:14:23,108
In great part because of the...

247
00:14:23,513 --> 00:14:27,338
huge support that was brought
by mission control center

248
00:14:27,538 --> 00:14:29,850
under the leadership
of Gene Kranz,

249
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,913
flight director of Apollo 13.

250
00:14:32,113 --> 00:14:35,075
Then we had 14, 15, 16 and 17,
the last one.

251
00:14:35,313 --> 00:14:37,175
For the last three,

252
00:14:37,479 --> 00:14:40,104
the Americans used a
lunar rover,

253
00:14:40,304 --> 00:14:43,516
an electrically powered lunar
rover which you see here.

254
00:14:43,874 --> 00:14:46,487
That was allowing to explore
a larger area

255
00:14:46,687 --> 00:14:50,124
around the landing point
of the lunar module.

256
00:14:53,412 --> 00:14:55,862
Apollo 17 for the first
time we had

257
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,649
a scientist, a geologist on board.

258
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:03,901
The Apollo service module,
the lunar module you see here

259
00:15:04,101 --> 00:15:07,501
Harrison Schmitt, a geologist who
really would like to bring back

260
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:10,501
that sample of the moon
to the earth.

261
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,063
But it's a little bit too big
so he had to use a little hammer

262
00:15:13,263 --> 00:15:16,501
to take a little piece 
of this large rock

263
00:15:17,963 --> 00:15:19,238
to be brought back to the earth.

264
00:15:19,438 --> 00:15:22,176
Now, of course it was 
a political impact

265
00:15:22,376 --> 00:15:24,563
of the Apollo program
which was huge.

266
00:15:24,952 --> 00:15:27,240
The Americans had successfully

267
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:31,876
accomplished the next step in
human space exploration.

268
00:15:32,076 --> 00:15:34,351
After the flight of Gagarin, they
went to the moon and back.

269
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:36,114
That was Apollo 11.

270
00:15:36,314 --> 00:15:38,889
But after Apollo 11, we had
all the other missions that

271
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,879
were used in order to
explore other regions

272
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,354
of the surface of the moon
and bring back a lot of samples.

273
00:15:45,542 --> 00:15:48,054
So we learnt a lot about
the moon,

274
00:15:48,254 --> 00:15:50,992
about the history of the moon,
about geological

275
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:53,974
and chemical composition
of the moon.

276
00:15:54,174 --> 00:15:56,811
There was a lot of science 
and technology

277
00:15:57,011 --> 00:16:00,011
that was benefited from
the Apollo program.

278
00:16:02,138 --> 00:16:05,538
The Soviets had quite an active

279
00:16:05,750 --> 00:16:07,688
and successful lunar program,

280
00:16:07,888 --> 00:16:10,588
but it was automatic.
And...

281
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:13,950
robotic, or remotely controlled
lunar program.

282
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,675
In fact they started early,

283
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,188
already in 1959

284
00:16:18,388 --> 00:16:23,163
or 2 years after the launch of
Sputnik 1 and Sputnik 2. 

285
00:16:24,487 --> 00:16:26,962
They had the first successful
picture taken

286
00:16:27,162 --> 00:16:29,812
of the far side of the moon
with the LUNA 3.

287
00:16:30,281 --> 00:16:32,881
Under the lunar program,
and again all

288
00:16:33,081 --> 00:16:37,869
automatic or remotely controlled
extended all the way to 1976.

289
00:16:38,069 --> 00:16:40,581
They were the total, 24 missions.

290
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:43,656
Not all of them were successful
but some of them were.

291
00:16:43,999 --> 00:16:47,362
And some of them were even
remarkably successful.

292
00:16:48,401 --> 00:16:50,876
The soviets operated 
the lunar (INAUDIBLE)

293
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,551
which was lunar rover,

294
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:55,751
which was commanded to

295
00:16:57,523 --> 00:16:59,498
move on the surface
of the moon

296
00:16:59,698 --> 00:17:02,185
and take detailed pictures
of the landscape.

297
00:17:02,385 --> 00:17:05,385
And also get some information
about

298
00:17:06,241 --> 00:17:08,491
the environment of the moon.

299
00:17:09,216 --> 00:17:10,841
The lunar program also had

300
00:17:11,191 --> 00:17:13,628
3 sample return missions.

301
00:17:13,828 --> 00:17:15,891
Automatic sample return missions 
which in itself

302
00:17:16,078 --> 00:17:17,941
is quite a remarkable achievement.

303
00:17:18,548 --> 00:17:20,985
So the whole LUNA program

304
00:17:21,364 --> 00:17:23,877
LUNA program of the Soviets

305
00:17:24,077 --> 00:17:26,027
was quite a successful program.

306
00:17:26,278 --> 00:17:29,416
They tried also to beat 
the Americans

307
00:17:29,926 --> 00:17:32,838
with a manned mission
in the 60s

308
00:17:33,038 --> 00:17:35,663
to the moon. And this is the
N-1 rocket

309
00:17:35,893 --> 00:17:38,756
that they tried to develop
in order to achieve

310
00:17:38,968 --> 00:17:40,868
that goal. Unfortunately
they were not successful.

311
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:45,290
The N-1 rocket had a lot
