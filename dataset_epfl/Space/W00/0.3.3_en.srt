1
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:07,836
This is a view of the Earth
from low Earth orbit.

2
00:00:07,836 --> 00:00:11,013
Low Earth orbit, like the name 
indicates, is relatively low,

3
00:00:11,013 --> 00:00:13,962
typically a few hundred kilometers
above the Earth's surface.

4
00:00:13,962 --> 00:00:17,174
Strictly speaking, we talk 
about LEO or low Earth orbit

5
00:00:17,174 --> 00:00:19,996
between 200 kilometers
above the Earth's surface

6
00:00:19,996 --> 00:00:21,732
up to 2,000 kilometers.

7
00:00:22,557 --> 00:00:24,892
That's where you see the Earth,
and a very thin atmosphere,

8
00:00:24,892 --> 00:00:27,698
you can hardly see it,
but a really, beautiful view.

9
00:00:28,165 --> 00:00:31,659
When the Sun is above the horizon
the background of the sky

10
00:00:31,659 --> 00:00:34,382
is completely black. 
You don't see the stars or the planet.

11
00:00:34,652 --> 00:00:37,281
And on low Earth orbit
you go typically around the Earth

12
00:00:37,281 --> 00:00:38,930
in about an hour and a half.

13
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:42,931
A little more for Hubble,
which is at 600 kilometers

14
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:46,468
which takes about 1 hour 35 minutes
to go around the Earth,

15
00:00:46,468 --> 00:00:48,445
but roughly an hour and a half.

16
00:00:48,853 --> 00:00:51,261
Now, how low can you go on an orbit?

17
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:53,486
That's an interesting question.

18
00:00:53,846 --> 00:00:58,497
Although the definition of space
is that it starts at 100 kilometers

19
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:02,714
above the Earth's surface,
this is the so called Kármán line,

20
00:01:02,714 --> 00:01:07,723
it's really the line of separation 
between the aeronautics and astronautics.

21
00:01:07,723 --> 00:01:13,135
Below that it's aeronautics
and above that is astronautics.

22
00:01:13,135 --> 00:01:17,031
In fact, it has been determined
that at that altitude of 100 kilometers

23
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:22,670
you would have to go so fast in order
to have enough lift for an aircraft,

24
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:24,889
that you would reach orbital speed.

25
00:01:24,889 --> 00:01:27,198
So that's why we have this definition

26
00:01:27,198 --> 00:01:30,996
of space being everything
above 100 kilometers.

27
00:01:30,996 --> 00:01:34,875
But there's no way to have
an orbit orbiting the Earth

28
00:01:34,875 --> 00:01:36,976
for any length of time at 100 kilometers.

29
00:01:36,976 --> 00:01:40,941
You have to be at least 
at 200, 250, 300 kilometers

30
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:45,631
in order to sustain the orbit
for several days or several weeks,

31
00:01:45,631 --> 00:01:50,081
because of the residual atmosphere
even at these altitudes

32
00:01:50,081 --> 00:01:54,258
you would have too much breaking
below, let's say, 200 kilometers.

33
00:01:54,258 --> 00:01:57,077
Typically the Shuttle was flying 
at 300 kilometers,

34
00:01:57,077 --> 00:01:59,551
except if it was needed to go higher,

35
00:01:59,551 --> 00:02:02,313
like visits to Hubble 
were at 600 kilometers,

36
00:02:02,313 --> 00:02:06,212
because that's where the telescope 
was located, and still is located.

37
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:09,057
Low Earth orbits, many missions,

38
00:02:09,057 --> 00:02:12,497
again, in this part of space.

39
00:02:12,497 --> 00:02:15,178
Obviously for human space flight
everything happened here

40
00:02:15,178 --> 00:02:18,339
except in the Apollo program
where they went to the Moon in the '60s.

41
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,182
Medium Earth orbit.

42
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:24,126
If you are above 2,000 kilometers
then you enter the region

43
00:02:24,126 --> 00:02:25,782
of a medium Earth orbit.

44
00:02:25,782 --> 00:02:27,838
Here you have a depiction,

45
00:02:27,838 --> 00:02:30,318
an artist's depiction,
of a Galileo satellite.

46
00:02:30,318 --> 00:02:34,494
This is the European 
global positioning system

47
00:02:34,494 --> 00:02:39,626
or precise navigation system set up
by the European Space Agency

48
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,463
and the European Union.

49
00:02:41,463 --> 00:02:43,411
Right now the system is 
not quite operational,

50
00:02:43,411 --> 00:02:46,328
but it will be in a few years from now.

51
00:02:46,328 --> 00:02:48,928
Typically, all
of the navigation satellite,

52
00:02:48,928 --> 00:02:51,818
whether they are GPS, the US GPS,

53
00:02:51,818 --> 00:02:56,363
or the Galileo system in preparation,
or the Chinese, or the Indian,

54
00:02:56,363 --> 00:02:58,915
or the Russian system, 
the GLONASS system,

55
00:02:58,915 --> 00:03:02,825
they are all at an altitude 
of about 20,000 kilometers

56
00:03:02,825 --> 00:03:04,362
above the Earth's surface,

57
00:03:04,362 --> 00:03:08,456
or 26,000 kilometers 
to the center of the Earth,

58
00:03:09,002 --> 00:03:12,316
in order to give them a period 
of revolution around the Earth

59
00:03:12,316 --> 00:03:16,172
of roughly 12 hours,
or half a sidereal day.

60
00:03:16,172 --> 00:03:19,081
So this is a medium Earth orbit.

61
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,798
A little higher we have 
a very important orbit which is

62
00:03:23,198 --> 00:03:27,212
or orbits in the plural, which are 
the geosynchronous orbits,

63
00:03:27,212 --> 00:03:33,072
orbits which are covered 
by the satellite or the spacecraft

64
00:03:33,072 --> 00:03:37,492
at the same time that it takes
the Earth to rotate around itself

65
00:03:37,492 --> 00:03:40,490
with respect to the stars,
or with respect to inertial space.

66
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:44,062
So geosynchronous orbit is 
at 36,000 kilometers

67
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:45,622
above the Earth's surface

68
00:03:45,622 --> 00:03:48,694
or 42,000 kilometers 
to the Earth's center.

69
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:51,721
And if, in addition 
to being geosynchronous,

70
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:54,932
you are over the equator
on a circular orbit,

71
00:03:54,932 --> 00:03:59,299
then it's geostationary, which means 
that the satellite will always remain

72
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:03,515
in the same part of the sky
seen from a location on the Earth.

73
00:04:04,265 --> 00:04:10,219
Nearly all communication satellites 
are located on geostationary orbits

74
00:04:10,219 --> 00:04:13,076
because you can have an antenna
in order to communicate

75
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:17,078
from one continent to another
for instance, which is absolutely fixed.

76
00:04:17,078 --> 00:04:19,489
You don't have to do any tracking
of the antenna.

77
00:04:19,489 --> 00:04:21,683
So it's much simpler,
technically speaking,

78
00:04:21,683 --> 00:04:24,183
to have geostationary orbits,

79
00:04:24,183 --> 00:04:27,510
again, 36,000 kilometers
above the Earth's surface,

80
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:29,631
on the equator in circular orbit.

81
00:04:30,802 --> 00:04:35,275
You don't have much above 
the geostationary orbits

82
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,857
and all the way to the Moon.

83
00:04:36,857 --> 00:04:41,920
It's not an area that is covered much
by satellites or spacecraft.

84
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:47,461
But obviously the Moon was
an interesting target for spacecraft

85
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:50,964
at the beginning 
of the space exploration time

86
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:53,876
which started as you know,
with Sputnik in 1957.

87
00:04:53,876 --> 00:04:55,844
Already in 1959,

88
00:04:55,844 --> 00:05:00,974
we had the first Soviet probes:
Luna 2, Luna 3,

89
00:05:00,974 --> 00:05:03,583
that were sent to the Moon in 1959.

90
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,233
Luna 3 even took pictures
of the far side of the Moon

91
00:05:06,233 --> 00:05:08,496
which was quite interesting
because it was the first time

92
00:05:08,496 --> 00:05:12,684
that we had the possibility of seeing
what has always been invisible

93
00:05:12,684 --> 00:05:17,891
for humanity, because the Moon
always has one its sides hidden from us,

94
00:05:17,891 --> 00:05:21,074
because it has the same period 
of revolution on itself

95
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:24,711
of the period of the time it takes
to go around the Earth.

96
00:05:25,131 --> 00:05:29,015
Of course, the glory of the exploration 
of the Moon was the Apollo program

97
00:05:29,015 --> 00:05:30,989
started in the early '60s.

98
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:35,827
Apollo 8 was the first mission
that went around the Moon.

99
00:05:35,827 --> 00:05:38,617
That was in December, 1968.

100
00:05:38,617 --> 00:05:40,671
And then Apollo 10 went 
also around the Moon

101
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:45,965
Rehearsal for the first landing 
on the Moon, which was in July, 1969.

102
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:49,560
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin
walked on the Moon,

103
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,787
and this very successful mission
was followed

104
00:05:51,787 --> 00:05:54,407
by six more landings on the Moon

105
00:05:54,407 --> 00:05:57,137
until 1972, Apollo 17

106
00:05:57,137 --> 00:05:59,746
and that's a picture taken on Apollo 17

107
00:05:59,746 --> 00:06:01,565
where we had Harrison Schmitt,

108
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:05,871
a geologist, astronaut,
close to a very big boulder,

109
00:06:06,935 --> 00:06:09,586
on the third spacewalk of Apollo 17.

110
00:06:09,586 --> 00:06:11,886
So a very remarkable program.

111
00:06:11,886 --> 00:06:14,383
And we'll talk a little bit 
about trajectories to the Moon

112
00:06:14,383 --> 00:06:17,515
and the strategy of the Apollo 
program to reach the Moon

113
00:06:17,515 --> 00:06:20,598
and land on the precise point
on the surface of our satellite.

114
00:06:22,176 --> 00:06:24,486
Solar system exploration:
again, this is going to be

115
00:06:24,486 --> 00:06:28,922
a pretty important section in this course.

116
00:06:29,438 --> 00:06:34,619
This started also quite early 
in the space program.

117
00:06:34,631 --> 00:06:38,790
I mentioned already the exploration 
of the Moon with the Luna spacecraft

118
00:06:38,790 --> 00:06:42,593
But we had Venera 4 in 1965,

119
00:06:42,593 --> 00:06:46,483
that went all the way to Venus.

120
00:06:46,483 --> 00:06:48,537
A few years later, in 1975,

121
00:06:48,537 --> 00:06:52,097
we had the landing
of Viking 1 and Viking 2,

122
00:06:52,097 --> 00:06:56,834
US spacecraft that landed
on the surface of the red planet.

123
00:06:56,834 --> 00:07:00,300
So, early in the space program
we explored the solar system

124
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,099
with landers or with probes.

125
00:07:04,472 --> 00:07:08,326
This has been an extremely 
successful program over the past years.

126
00:07:08,326 --> 00:07:13,389
We have explored all of the planets
of the solar system: Mercury, Venus, Mars,

127
00:07:13,389 --> 00:07:15,768
Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune.

128
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:19,750
Even Pluto recently with a New Horizons
that made a flyby of Pluto

129
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,978
and took remarkable pictures
of Pluto itself, and its five satellites.

130
00:07:25,358 --> 00:07:28,108
This picture was taken 
by the Cassini spacecraft

131
00:07:28,108 --> 00:07:33,414
on orbit around Saturn
for the last 10 years or so,

132
00:07:33,414 --> 00:07:38,297
and it's quite a remarkable picture,
because you see the globe of Saturn

133
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:40,833
on the upper left of the picture.

134
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:45,953
You see of course, the rings
of this magnificent planet

135
00:07:45,953 --> 00:07:48,217
including a ring 
that is not visible from Earth

136
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:50,867
and has been detected by Cassini.

137
00:07:50,867 --> 00:07:56,669
And you have this object here 
with an arrow, a very faint object,

138
00:07:56,669 --> 00:08:02,218
this is the Earth seen from Saturn
at the distance of one light hour.

139
00:08:02,638 --> 00:08:06,543
So again, this is quite an achievement
to be able to control a spacecraft

140
00:08:06,543 --> 00:08:11,314
and direct its cameras towards 
satellite that are recorded

141
00:08:11,314 --> 00:08:15,277
in great detail at the distance
of one light hour from us.

142
00:08:15,907 --> 00:08:17,483
Solar System Exploration.

143
00:08:17,483 --> 00:08:21,721
This is a big subject and we had 
also a very successful flyby

144
00:08:21,721 --> 00:08:26,459
and exploration of a comet,
Churyumov–Gerasimenko

145
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:31,460
by the Rosetta spacecraft 
starting in 2014, continued in 2015,

146
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:34,118
and it's still going on now in 2016.
