00:00:05,968 --> 00:00:07,496
Hello everyone!

2
00:00:07,496 --> 00:00:11,262
Welcome to space science
and unmanned exploration

3
00:00:11,262 --> 00:00:15,730
and, particularly,
astrophysics and solar observations.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:22,057
We start with the Hubble Space Telescope,
the jewel of the space observatories

5
00:00:22,057 --> 00:00:27,132
a real discovery machine
that was launched in 1990,

6
00:00:27,132 --> 00:00:29,543
so a little more than 25 years ago,

7
00:00:29,543 --> 00:00:33,456
and has been an extraordinary instrument
for new discoveries in astronomy,

8
00:00:33,456 --> 00:00:37,878
very much liked by the public also
because of the beauty of the pictures

9
00:00:37,878 --> 00:00:41,175
that it's sending every week to us.

10
00:00:41,175 --> 00:00:45,981
It was deployed from
the Space Shuttle in April, 1990,

11
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:48,791
on a 600-kilometer high orbit

12
00:00:48,791 --> 00:00:51,942
and the plan was to visit it
on a regular basis,

13
00:00:52,862 --> 00:00:56,953
to do servicing missions
to either do repair work if needed,

14
00:00:56,953 --> 00:01:00,344
maintenance, or to change
the scientific instrument

15
00:01:00,344 --> 00:01:02,912
or the focus of the telescope.

16
00:01:03,346 --> 00:01:05,718
We had a grand total
of five servicing missions,

17
00:01:05,718 --> 00:01:09,947
the first one in 1993, when we had
to install optical corrector.

18
00:01:09,947 --> 00:01:12,371
We had an optical problem
with the primary mirror

19
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:15,442
that didn't really have the proper shape.

20
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,613
And four more servicing missions
after that, until 2009,

21
00:01:19,613 --> 00:01:22,184
when the last one was performed.

22
00:01:22,184 --> 00:01:23,790
The telescope is in good shape,

23
00:01:23,790 --> 00:01:26,492
it still is a very productive
scientific instrument,

24
00:01:26,977 --> 00:01:31,569
it should still last for several years
before its successor takes over.

25
00:01:31,569 --> 00:01:37,593
I had the privilege of space walking
on Hubble in December 1999,

26
00:01:37,593 --> 00:01:41,490
more precisely, 
on the 23rd of December, 1999,

27
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,551
on the second spacewalk
of a shuttle mission STS-103,

28
00:01:45,744 --> 00:01:49,390
and the spacewalk was
an eight hours and ten minute exercise

29
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:51,622
that together with Mike Foale,

30
00:01:51,622 --> 00:01:56,408
who is a subject of a Focus
on astronaut prespective,

31
00:01:56,408 --> 00:02:01,341
so give a nice hand to Mike Foale 
when you see him on the Focus

32
00:02:01,341 --> 00:02:05,938
and remember we spacewalked together
on this magnificent instrument,

33
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:08,295
we changed the primary computer
of Hubble,

34
00:02:08,295 --> 00:02:11,052
we changed one
of the fine guidance sensors

35
00:02:11,052 --> 00:02:14,222
and did some other maintenance work
on the telescope.

36
00:02:14,222 --> 00:02:16,164
Wonderful memories, 
Hubble Space Telescope,

37
00:02:16,164 --> 00:02:17,774
a jewel in the sky.

38
00:02:18,374 --> 00:02:21,414
The Hubble Space Telescope
has a very high resolution;

39
00:02:21,414 --> 00:02:24,509
it's about one twentieth
of an arc second resolution,

40
00:02:24,509 --> 00:02:30,898
so we can get very precise, fine pictures
of celestial objects.

41
00:02:30,898 --> 00:02:34,334
In the background here,
you have the Hubble Ultra Deep Field

42
00:02:34,334 --> 00:02:37,955
which is one of the major results
obtained by Hubble

43
00:02:37,955 --> 00:02:41,021
with the advanced camera for surveys.

44
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:46,341
Recently, originally we had the so-called
Hubble Deep Field in 1994,

45
00:02:46,341 --> 00:02:49,910
shortly after the first servicing mission
of the telescope.

46
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,769
The telescope was used mainly
to do the Deep Field,

47
00:02:53,769 --> 00:02:55,309
as mentioned already,

48
00:02:55,309 --> 00:03:00,174
two major Deep Fields;
and one Southern deep field also.

49
00:03:00,174 --> 00:03:04,939
There was a proof that a quasar resides
in galaxies and also black holes;

50
00:03:04,939 --> 00:03:07,291
expansion of the universe
was measured,

51
00:03:07,291 --> 00:03:09,991
and there were a lot
of studies of star formation

52
00:03:09,991 --> 00:03:16,851
in nebulae in our galaxy
that were observed in great detail

53
00:03:16,851 --> 00:03:20,851
to see how stars formed
by condensation of the interstellar matter

54
00:03:20,851 --> 00:03:24,151
out of these clouds of gas
and dust in our galaxy.

55
00:03:24,618 --> 00:03:25,900
Also, planetary nebulae,

56
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:30,820
which are the last stages 
of the life of massive stars

57
00:03:30,820 --> 00:03:37,352
that expand and reject
a lot of gas in their vicinity

58
00:03:37,352 --> 00:03:42,646
and produce really beautiful objects
that are named planetary nebulae.

59
00:03:43,657 --> 00:03:48,186
This is the planned successor to Hubble,
and it should be launched in 2018,

60
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:51,873
a product of cooperation between NASA,
the European Space Agency,

61
00:03:51,873 --> 00:03:54,334
and the Canadian Space Agency.

62
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,558
In the upper right you see the size

63
00:03:56,558 --> 00:04:00,350
of the segmented mirror
of the James Webb Space Telescope.

64
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,744
Of course, it's folded when it's launched.

65
00:04:02,744 --> 00:04:06,595
It will be launched on Ariane 5,
launched from Kourou, French Guiana,

66
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:09,250
part of the contribution
of the European Space Agency.

67
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,505
Then, it will be deployed
when it gets on station

68
00:04:12,505 --> 00:04:15,260
on the Lagrange point, L2,

69
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,637
and you see the comparison,
the size of the primary mirror

70
00:04:18,637 --> 00:04:20,754
compared to the Hubble primary mirror.

71
00:04:20,754 --> 00:04:22,361
So, of course, we collect 
much more energy,

72
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:25,134
we can see objects that are very faint,

73
00:04:25,134 --> 00:04:27,952
and it will be working
in the infrared part of the spectrum also.

74
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:30,937
On the left hand side 
you see the telescope itself,

75
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,434
It's an open telescope,

76
00:04:32,434 --> 00:04:36,595
it has a large shield that will protect it

77
00:04:36,595 --> 00:04:39,413
from the radiation from the Sun,
from the Earth and from the Moon,

78
00:04:39,413 --> 00:04:41,348
and it's going to be a very cold object

79
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:44,513
it will observe,
as mentioned, in the infrared,

80
00:04:44,513 --> 00:04:50,515
so its detectors will be cooled,
and it's good to have it in such situation

81
00:04:50,515 --> 00:04:53,844
where is totally protected 
from an warm object like the Sun,

82
00:04:53,844 --> 00:04:55,445
the Earth and the Moon.

83
00:04:56,829 --> 00:05:02,339
Herschel and Planck are two ESA,
European Space Agency space observatories

84
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:05,581
that were both launched in 2009,

85
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:10,234
Herschel lived until 2013,
and Planck until 2012.

86
00:05:10,954 --> 00:05:13,517
In fact, they are working
in the far infrared,

87
00:05:13,517 --> 00:05:17,866
respectively, microwave region
of the spectrum for Planck;

88
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,157
and they need cooling
after a few years only.

89
00:05:21,157 --> 00:05:23,000
We have no more coolants,

90
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:26,931
so it's the end
of the operational life of the telescope.

91
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:32,188
These two were located on the so-called
L2 Lagrange point

92
00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:33,993
of the Sun-Earth system.

93
00:05:33,993 --> 00:05:36,868
You see a drawing
on the left hand side with the Sun,

94
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:41,057
the Earth about 150,000,000 km 
away from the Sun

95
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:45,820
and the L2 Lagrange point is about
1.5 million km from the Earth

96
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,875
in the anti-Sun direction

97
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:52,170
and both of these telescopes were
on so-called halo orbits

98
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,850
around the L2 Lagrange point.

99
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:57,850
We will come back to these L2
and also L1 Lagrange points

100
00:05:57,850 --> 00:05:59,280
later in the course.

101
00:06:00,045 --> 00:06:05,363
Both telescopes were very successful.
Herschel was studying very cold objects

102
00:06:05,363 --> 00:06:09,872
and the formation of planetary
systems around stars.

103
00:06:09,872 --> 00:06:14,631
Planck was looking at really dark matter
and very cold objects in the universe.

104
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:22,468
Spitzer and XMM, respectively
an infrared telescope and x-ray telescope

105
00:06:22,468 --> 00:06:24,810
NASA observatories.

106
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:29,842
In fact, Spitzer, XMM,
and Hubble are three

107
00:06:29,842 --> 00:06:32,633
of the so-called
great observatories of NASA

108
00:06:33,113 --> 00:06:35,292
observing respectively, in the infrared,

109
00:06:35,292 --> 00:06:36,974
Hubble is more in the visible,

110
00:06:36,974 --> 00:06:39,246
and near infrared and near ultraviolet,

111
00:06:39,812 --> 00:06:42,826
and of course, XMM is looking
at very short wavelength

112
00:06:42,826 --> 00:06:44,902
in the x-ray part of the spectrum.

113
00:06:45,407 --> 00:06:49,136
And many objects had been studied
by all three great observatories

114
00:06:49,136 --> 00:06:54,806
to have a view of these objects
in a broad wavelength range

115
00:06:54,806 --> 00:06:57,580
from x-rays all the way to far infrared.

116
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:03,403
Gaia is an ESA spacecraft
also an ESA project.

117
00:07:04,997 --> 00:07:07,279
It's on orbit at the current time,

118
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:11,476
it's doing extremely precise measurements
of the position and proper motion

119
00:07:11,476 --> 00:07:15,060
of about one billion stars in our galaxy.

120
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,434
It follows the Hipparcos program
which was doing the same thing

121
00:07:18,434 --> 00:07:21,203
a few years ago,
but with less accuracy,

122
00:07:21,203 --> 00:07:24,182
so it's also a telescope

123
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:27,795
that has as its objective
to do measurements in the sky,

124
00:07:27,795 --> 00:07:29,833
it's an astronomy satellite,

125
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,997
but not so much for pretty pictures

126
00:07:31,997 --> 00:07:34,770
like the other telescope
I talked about before,

127
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:38,534
but much more for a very determination,

128
00:07:38,534 --> 00:07:42,650
very precisely of the geometry
of our nearby universe around the Sun.

129
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:47,873
LISA Pathfinder is an ESA spacecraft
launched in late 2015,

130
00:07:47,873 --> 00:07:49,927
that is a precursor to LISA

131
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:54,794
that has as its objective to detect
gravitational waves from faraway objects,

132
00:07:55,080 --> 00:08:02,156
whenever you have massive objects
relatively nearby or far away universe,

133
00:08:02,156 --> 00:08:06,776
that generate gravitational waves
that so far, have never been detected,

134
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:11,012
so LISA Pathfinder is there
to develop the technologies

135
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:15,629
to later use them on LISA
to detect these gravitational waves.

136
00:08:16,314 --> 00:08:21,830
SOHO solar and heliospheric observatory
is an ESA/NASA spacecraft

137
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:25,428
that has been very successful
in the observation of the Sun

138
00:08:25,428 --> 00:08:28,982
located on the L1 Lagrange point
of the Sun-Earth system

139
00:08:28,982 --> 00:08:31,854
so between the Earth and the Sun,

140
00:08:31,854 --> 00:08:34,097
but much closer to the Earth
than the Sun,

141
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:38,565
about 1.5 million km
from the Earth in the Sun direction.

142
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:42,960
It follows the Earth in its orbit
around the Sun all year long,

143
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:48,299
and it has, of course,
an unprecedented view of the Sun

144
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:51,533
in a wide range of the wavelengths

145
00:08:51,533 --> 00:08:53,175
because you don't have the atmosphere

146
00:08:53,175 --> 00:08:56,999
absorbing the very short wavelength
in the infrared.

147
00:08:56,999 --> 00:09:01,859
It mainly observed the Sun
in the extreme ultraviolet and x-ray

148
00:09:01,859 --> 00:09:06,837
because you can detect
the very active portion

149
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,396
to the Sun atmosphere
in these wavelengths,

150
00:09:09,396 --> 00:09:13,192
and also it was equipped,
or still is equipped, with a coronograph

151
00:09:13,192 --> 00:09:16,980
in order to detect outer layers
of the Sun atmosphere,

152
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,703
and also the burst of energy,
the solar mass, coronal mass ejections

153
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:28,123
that produce reflexive particles
in the solar system that reach the Earth

154
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:32,495
and produce in fact disturbances
in the Earth's atmosphere and also for satellites.

155
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,861
A very successful program:

156
00:09:34,861 --> 00:09:36,816
it lasted much longer than anticipated,

157
00:09:36,816 --> 00:09:38,849
it was planned to be used
for about five years,

158
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:41,293
now it's more than 20 years,
and it still is active.

159
00:09:42,483 --> 00:09:44,553
Solar Dynamics Observatory is,

160
00:09:44,553 --> 00:09:47,403
in a way, a follower of SOHO,
which, at some point will die,

161
00:09:47,403 --> 00:09:49,683
will be no longer useful,

162
00:09:49,683 --> 00:09:51,166
and it's a NASA spacecraft,

163
00:09:51,806 --> 00:09:54,665
and it has a much higher resolution 
than SOHO.

164
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:59,901
And unlike SOHO, it is not
on the L1 Lagrange point,

165
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:02,791
but it is on a geo-synchronous orbit

166
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:06,683
about 28.5 degrees inclination
with respect to the equator,

167
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:11,596
it's constantly visible from the US,
and it can radiate all the data

168
00:10:11,596 --> 00:10:16,492
to the ground station
in White Sands, New Mexico.

169
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:21,488
As it has a very high resolution,
it sends at a very high data rate

170
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:26,715
of precise observations
of the dynamics of the solar

171
00:10:26,715 --> 00:10:29,731
photosphere and chromosphere
to the ground station.

172
00:10:29,731 --> 00:10:32,997
A very successful instrument to detect

173
00:10:32,997 --> 00:10:36,889
in great detail the activity of the Sun.

174
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:41,114
Last but not least, we have
a very successful astronomy

175
00:10:41,114 --> 00:10:45,808
and solar observation program
from space from India.

176
00:10:45,832 --> 00:10:50,002
The Astrosat, we see it here;

177
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:53,551
in the preparation phase

178
00:10:53,551 --> 00:10:57,551
in a clean room prior to its launch

179
00:10:57,551 --> 00:11:01,551
which was in 2015, so quite recently.

180
00:11:02,247 --> 00:11:06,247
It's deployed on an equatorial orbit
650 km altitude

181
00:11:06,247 --> 00:11:10,797
and is recording very interesting data,

182
00:11:11,707 --> 00:11:15,707
again, in wavelength regions
that are not accessible from the ground

183
00:11:15,707 --> 00:11:18,127
in the ultraviolet and the x-rays,

184
00:11:18,127 --> 00:11:22,127
and it serves very well
the scientific community

185
00:11:22,127 --> 00:11:24,437
and the astrophysicists in India.

186
00:11:25,434 --> 00:11:29,434
Adytia 1 will be launched in 2019 or 2020

187
00:11:29,434 --> 00:11:37,334
and is pretty much the same type
of instrument or satellite,

188
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:44,510
a scientific facility as SOHO
and Solar Dynamics Observatory

189
00:11:44,510 --> 00:11:48,510
to observe the Sun in the wavelength
region not accessible from the ground,

190
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,470
mainly extreme ultraviolet and x-rays.
