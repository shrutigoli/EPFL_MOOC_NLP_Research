1
00:00:05,459 --> 00:00:09,284
Towards the end of the Apollo program
in the early 70s,

2
00:00:09,285 --> 00:00:14,553
the Soviets have not been able
to reach the Moon by human means

3
00:00:14,554 --> 00:00:16,833
and they started to develop
space stations.

4
00:00:16,834 --> 00:00:22,753
And the first space station they launched
was the so-called <i>Salyut Space Station,</i>

5
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:26,006
the one that you see
on the left-hand side.

6
00:00:26,068 --> 00:00:27,656
It was launched in 1971,

7
00:00:27,657 --> 00:00:31,009
so it is shortly before the end
of the Apollo program,

8
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:35,800
and it was used until 1985,
so quite a long time.

9
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:40,145
After the completion
of the Apollo program, Apollo 17 in '72,

10
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:45,156
the Americans decided to use
the Saturn V hardware

11
00:00:45,157 --> 00:00:47,240
in order not to go to the Moon any longer

12
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:52,952
but the last stage was transformed into
a space station, the Skylab Space Station

13
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:54,691
which is in the middle.

14
00:00:54,692 --> 00:00:58,587
This is a relatively short-lived program
between 1973,

15
00:00:58,588 --> 00:01:01,420
one year after the end
of the Apollo program.

16
00:01:01,421 --> 00:01:07,284
In 1974, there were three missions:
one of 28 days, one of 59 days,

17
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:12,886
and of 84 days of Americans
who occupied the space station.

18
00:01:12,887 --> 00:01:16,999
in a way temporary space station
for these three missions.

19
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,834
The Russians continued very heavily
into the development of space stations

20
00:01:21,836 --> 00:01:26,314
and the successor
to the Salyut Station was <i>Mir,</i>

21
00:01:26,315 --> 00:01:28,738
which you see on the right hand side.

22
00:01:28,739 --> 00:01:33,350
A much more complex
and efficient space station

23
00:01:33,351 --> 00:01:39,703
that was operated 
from about 1986 until 2001.

24
00:01:39,709 --> 00:01:41,792
Then it was deorbited
in a controlled manner

25
00:01:41,793 --> 00:01:43,870
to splash down in the Pacific Ocean.

26
00:01:43,871 --> 00:01:47,923
So again, you see this development
of space stations mainly by the Soviets

27
00:01:47,924 --> 00:01:49,465
and later by the Russians,

28
00:01:49,466 --> 00:01:54,611
and a quick step in that direction
by the Americans with the Skylab program.

29
00:01:55,262 --> 00:01:59,630
Apollo Soyuz that was a cooperation,
relative short-lived cooperation program

30
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:05,330
between the Soviet Union and the US
with the mating in low Earth orbit

31
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:09,699
of an Apollo spacecraft
which you see here,

32
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:14,526
and a Soyuz spacecraft over there.

33
00:02:14,527 --> 00:02:18,531
The commanders of the spacecraft
were Tom Stafford on the US side

34
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:21,666
and Alexei Leonov on the Russian side.

35
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:25,205
The Americans had to install
a docking adapter

36
00:02:25,206 --> 00:02:27,090
on the Apollo spacecraft

37
00:02:27,091 --> 00:02:31,129
to be able to dock
to the Soyuz spacecraft.

38
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:35,667
That was quite a successful mission
but it was not really a huge step

39
00:02:35,668 --> 00:02:38,726
in their cooperation effort
between the Soviet Union and the US

40
00:02:38,727 --> 00:02:40,489
which came much later.

41
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:44,970
Space Shuttle. The Space Shuttle
was already in the thought of NASA,

42
00:02:44,971 --> 00:02:49,168
the Americans, toward the end
of the Apollo program in the early 70s.

43
00:02:49,197 --> 00:02:53,717
It was developed
during this whole decade of the 70s.

44
00:02:53,718 --> 00:02:59,821
The idea was really to provide
to all users a real workhorse

45
00:02:59,822 --> 00:03:02,448
for access to low Earth orbits.

46
00:03:02,449 --> 00:03:05,173
Initially it was going to be
for commercial payloads,

47
00:03:05,174 --> 00:03:07,418
for military payload,
Department of Defense

48
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:10,347
and also for science and exploration.

49
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:13,945
It was going to replace
all of the expendable rockets

50
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:16,635
that had been used until that time.

51
00:03:16,636 --> 00:03:20,643
As mentioned, it was workhorse
for access to low Earth orbit

52
00:03:20,644 --> 00:03:25,658
during the 80s, the 90s
and the first decade of the new century.

53
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:29,706
The program lasted 
a grand total of 30 years,

54
00:03:29,707 --> 00:03:35,965
from 1981, the first flight which happens,
that was the 12th of April 1981,

55
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:41,963
so exactly 20 years after
the first flight in space of Yuri Gagarin.

56
00:03:43,209 --> 00:03:46,668
John Young and Bob Crippen
were the commanders of STS-1.

57
00:03:47,136 --> 00:03:53,411
Then followed 134 missions in total,

58
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:57,839
so a total of 135 during 30 years
of the Space Shuttle.

59
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,535
The program that was remarkable
in the sense that it was very flexible,

60
00:04:02,536 --> 00:04:08,682
it could bring large payloads into orbit
up to 20 tons in the large payload bay

61
00:04:08,683 --> 00:04:11,802
behind the cockpit
for seven people maximum,

62
00:04:11,845 --> 00:04:15,438
and the Aft Compartment
with the three hydrogen engines.

63
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:21,971
It could do interventions
on satellites or telescopes.

64
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:26,236
It allowed the Hubble Program,
not only the deployment in 1990

65
00:04:26,237 --> 00:04:28,872
but all of the five
servicing missions of Hubble

66
00:04:28,873 --> 00:04:31,708
were only possible
thanks to the Space Shuttle.

67
00:04:31,709 --> 00:04:35,251
It also made possible
the Space Station program.

68
00:04:35,252 --> 00:04:36,658
International Space Station,

69
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:39,667
the Russian elements were brought
with the Proton rockets

70
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:41,812
but all of the elements
for the other nations

71
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:47,042
principally the US, but also Canada,
Japan, and Europe were brought

72
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:49,387
by the Space Shuttle.

73
00:04:49,388 --> 00:04:52,710
So we had five engines,
three hydrogen engines

74
00:04:52,711 --> 00:04:55,810
using the content
of this big external tank,

75
00:04:55,811 --> 00:05:02,166
and two solid rocket boosters
powered by solid propellant

76
00:05:02,167 --> 00:05:06,876
and they were jettisoned after two minutes,
after the propellant was completely used.

77
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:11,110
The ascent into orbit lasted only
about 8 1/2 minutes,

78
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:17,994
so two minutes with five engines
including two solid propellant rockets.

79
00:05:17,995 --> 00:05:19,574
and the last six and a half minutes

80
00:05:19,575 --> 00:05:24,836
under the power of only
the remaining three hydrogen engines.

81
00:05:25,692 --> 00:05:29,007
Of course it was reusable.
It ended it's mission with a glide,

82
00:05:29,084 --> 00:05:34,395
over Kennedy Space Center, Florida
and landing on a 5km long runway

83
00:05:34,396 --> 00:05:36,007
at Kennedy Space Center.

84
00:05:36,008 --> 00:05:38,688
There were other landing sites
like <i>Edwards</i> in California

85
00:05:38,689 --> 00:05:42,666
whenever the weather was inappropriate
at Kennedy Space Center,

86
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:44,272
could land here at Edwards.

87
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:48,150
There was one landing
at <i>White Sands</i> facility also.

88
00:05:48,151 --> 00:05:50,298
And so again, quite a flexible vehicle,

89
00:05:50,299 --> 00:05:53,270
very successful
in terms of what it could achieve

90
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:57,126
Unfortunately, more expensive
than had been anticipated

91
00:05:57,127 --> 00:06:01,367
and had two major accidents,
<i>Challenger</i> in 1986,

92
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:03,660
and <i>Columbia</i> in 2003, regrettably.

93
00:06:05,236 --> 00:06:09,147
Now, together with the development
of the Space Shuttle program,

94
00:06:09,148 --> 00:06:12,536
the Americans invited 
the Europeans and the Canadians

95
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:14,069
to participate in the program.

96
00:06:14,982 --> 00:06:18,918
And the Europeans participated
in the development, manufacture,

97
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:22,485
delivery to the US
of the Spacelab Laboratory.

98
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:23,882
The idea of the Europeans,

99
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:28,543
it was their first access to space
with human means with the Space Shuttle

100
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:31,221
but the interest was mainly in science.

101
00:06:31,222 --> 00:06:36,694
They wanted to have a tool
to do scientific experiments

102
00:06:36,695 --> 00:06:38,541
in low Earth orbit.

103
00:06:38,542 --> 00:06:41,794
So <i>Spacelab</i> consisted in a module
but we also had the pallets

104
00:06:41,795 --> 00:06:43,773
which could be located behind the module.

105
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:46,334
We had also
a configurational Spacelab

106
00:06:46,335 --> 00:06:50,791
with pallets only supporting equipment,
antennas, telescopes,

107
00:06:50,792 --> 00:06:52,584
various instruments.

108
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:57,112
And then the access from the mid deck
of the Space Shuttle,

109
00:06:57,113 --> 00:07:00,028
you have basically
two living compartments,

110
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:01,912
the <i>Flight Deck</i> and the <i>Mid Deck</i>,

111
00:07:01,913 --> 00:07:06,200
and the access to Spacelab 
was via a tunnel which you see here.

112
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:11,175
And that is really the ticket of entry
of Europe into human space flight

113
00:07:11,176 --> 00:07:15,272
and together with this agreement
with the US to deliver Spacelab

114
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:19,842
and operate it, we had the opportunity
for Europeans to become astronauts.

115
00:07:19,843 --> 00:07:24,209
ESA did the first astronaut selection
in 1978, and I was privileged to be

116
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:28,584
one of the three who were selected
together with Ulf Merbold from Germany,

117
00:07:28,585 --> 00:07:31,207
and Wubbo Ockels from the Netherlands.

118
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:35,911
So Spacelab flew a grand total
of 22 times with the Space Shuttle,

119
00:07:35,912 --> 00:07:40,437
Out of the 135 missions,
22 of them carried Spacelab,

120
00:07:40,438 --> 00:07:43,932
either the pallet only,
or pallet plus module,

121
00:07:43,933 --> 00:07:47,243
or module only for certain missions.

122
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:52,436
The first flight of Spacelab was STS-9,
the ninth Shuttle mission in 1983,

123
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:58,816
and we had also the first West European
to fly in space, Ulf Merbold from Germany.

124
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,916
This is the view of the Spacelab module.

125
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:06,631
We can see clearly the tunnel 
between the Mid Deck of the Shuttle

126
00:08:06,632 --> 00:08:09,333
and the Spacelab laboratory.

127
00:08:09,334 --> 00:08:14,708
This is the configuration with the module,
but this is Spacelab 1.

128
00:08:14,709 --> 00:08:17,084
In fact, there were
also pallets in the back

129
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:20,375
with instruments that were exposed
to the space environment.

130
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:24,876
Here you see a bunch of happy scientists
doing experiments on board of Spacelab.

131
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,603
There's quite a lot of volume.

132
00:08:26,604 --> 00:08:30,479
I mean, what the Spacelab was bringing
was on one hand, a number of experiments

133
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:33,302
on the walls of the laboratory.

134
00:08:33,303 --> 00:08:35,541
And the computer power, also,

135
00:08:35,542 --> 00:08:37,583
there were special computers
that were used

136
00:08:37,601 --> 00:08:42,975
in order to manage and control
all of the experiments on board.

137
00:08:42,993 --> 00:08:45,593
But there were lots
of manual experiments also

138
00:08:45,594 --> 00:08:50,124
biology experiments,
life science experiments.

139
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:52,966
There were some animals
taken on board of Spacelab.

140
00:08:54,136 --> 00:08:56,833
It was quite a successful program.

141
00:08:56,924 --> 00:09:01,958
It brought a lot of confidence 
in the US and in Europe

142
00:09:01,959 --> 00:09:06,490
in the ability to use such a spacecraft
for performing science,

143
00:09:06,491 --> 00:09:08,130
although the missions were limited

144
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:11,082
to a duration of approximately 
15 days at a maximum.

145
00:09:11,083 --> 00:09:13,524
That was the limitation
of the Space Shuttle itself,

146
00:09:13,525 --> 00:09:18,455
not having solar arrays, and using fuel cell
to generate electricity,

147
00:09:18,478 --> 00:09:21,783
the missions were of course,
of limited duration.

148
00:09:23,001 --> 00:09:25,865
The contribution of Canada,
also invited by NASA

149
00:09:25,876 --> 00:09:31,043
to participate in the Shuttle program
was the <i>Canadarm</i>, I mean, the robot arm.

150
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:38,046
Quite a useful and efficient system,
very well designed and built.

151
00:09:38,047 --> 00:09:42,328
It was a six-droid arm,
pretty much like the human arm

152
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:45,056
with two joints on the shoulder.

153
00:09:45,057 --> 00:09:48,362
One joint on the elbow,
and three joints on the wrist,

154
00:09:48,363 --> 00:09:55,181
so there's a one-to-one correlation
between the six droid's angles

155
00:09:55,182 --> 00:10:01,360
and the position and orientation
of the end-effect of the robot arm.

156
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:02,792
But it worked quite well.

157
00:10:02,793 --> 00:10:07,861
It has been extremely useful
especially for missions like

158
00:10:07,862 --> 00:10:09,849
the Hubble Space Telescope repair mission

159
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:14,146
where the telescope had to be grappled
with a robot arm by the arm operator,

160
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,792
after completion of the rendezvous
with the telescope,

161
00:10:16,793 --> 00:10:20,717
and all of the space walks
were supported also by the robot arm,

162
00:10:20,718 --> 00:10:22,261
with the platform at the end,

163
00:10:22,262 --> 00:10:24,272
carrying one 
of the space-walking astronaut

164
00:10:24,273 --> 00:10:26,327
to do the job on the telescope.

165
00:10:27,235 --> 00:10:32,046
Again, quite a remarkable contribution
to the program by the Canadians.

166
00:10:33,709 --> 00:10:36,405
Between 1994 and 1998,

167
00:10:36,406 --> 00:10:42,081
we had this so called
<i>special Mir program.</i>

168
00:10:42,082 --> 00:10:47,001
This is the beginning
of a real agreement between Russia

169
00:10:47,002 --> 00:10:53,836
and the United States to use Mir
for satellite experiments beyond Spacelab

170
00:10:53,837 --> 00:10:58,166
because its duration was much more
than what was possible with Spacelab.

171
00:10:58,792 --> 00:11:02,955
But also the development of hardware
to make it possible for the Shuttle to dock

172
00:11:02,956 --> 00:11:04,920
on the Mir Space Station.

173
00:11:04,921 --> 00:11:09,755
This is really a precursor
to the International Space Station Program

174
00:11:09,756 --> 00:11:12,416
that started a few years later.

175
00:11:12,542 --> 00:11:15,260
It allowed as well,
Russians and Americans

176
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:17,851
to learn about cooperation 
in space for science

177
00:11:17,876 --> 00:11:21,668
and mating of the individual hardware.

178
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:27,542
So the cooperation between Russia
and the United States continued in the 90s

179
00:11:27,576 --> 00:11:32,132
and an agreement was passed
for really the building

180
00:11:32,132 --> 00:11:35,913
of the International Space Station
together with a lot of other partners.

181
00:11:35,914 --> 00:11:42,305
In fact, the grand total of the partners
is 15 for the International Space Station.

182
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:47,013
We have the United States, 
Russia, Canada, and Japan

183
00:11:47,014 --> 00:11:50,825
and 11 member states
of the <i>European Space Agency,</i>

184
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:52,499
including Switzerland.

185
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:56,725
So that's not only
a very interesting endeavor

186
00:11:56,726 --> 00:12:02,249
in providing world class laboratory
in low Earth orbit for all these partners,

187
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:06,635
but it was a really interesting experiment
in international cooperation

188
00:12:06,636 --> 00:12:08,681
at a very high level.

189
00:12:08,682 --> 00:12:10,877
Now in the left-hand side,

190
00:12:10,878 --> 00:12:14,141
you see the first elements
of the first mating

191
00:12:14,142 --> 00:12:16,782
of the first two elements of the station.

192
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:21,668
We have Zarya from Russia,
or the so-called FGB on the far left side.

193
00:12:21,676 --> 00:12:26,192
And you have the NODE 1 in gray color,

194
00:12:26,327 --> 00:12:30,875
the first American element that was mated

195
00:12:30,876 --> 00:12:35,635
following a Shuttle flight
that rendezvoused with the Zarya in 1998.

196
00:12:35,636 --> 00:12:40,451
A little later in the 2000,
you see the Space Station slowly growing.

197
00:12:40,488 --> 00:12:44,363
On the top you see still NODE 1 and Zarya,

198
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:50,198
and you see Zvezda in the bottom
which is another large Russian module

199
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:52,458
that have been brought by Proton.

200
00:12:52,535 --> 00:12:57,082
So little by little, the assembly
of the Space Station was going on

201
00:12:57,083 --> 00:13:01,709
and it continued until 2011
when there was a completion of the ISS

202
00:13:01,729 --> 00:13:05,480
at the same time
as the retirement of the Space Shuttle.

203
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:09,827
There you see all the elements
that constitute

204
00:13:09,828 --> 00:13:11,762
the International Space Station.

205
00:13:11,763 --> 00:13:16,152
As you see there are a lot of pieces,
some of them, again the Russian ones

206
00:13:16,153 --> 00:13:17,584
were brought by Proton rocket

207
00:13:17,585 --> 00:13:20,074
but all the others
were brought by the Space Shuttle.

208
00:13:20,075 --> 00:13:22,653
And right now,
as the Shuttle has been retired,

209
00:13:22,654 --> 00:13:27,431
there's no way to bring another big piece
to the International Space Station.

210
00:13:27,432 --> 00:13:31,351
But those are previsions
of a number of spares that were installed

211
00:13:31,352 --> 00:13:35,919
on some external pallets
in order to be quite certain

212
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,257
that the program could continue
for another decade or so.

213
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:45,296
The forward portion of the Station,
this is the velocity vector.

214
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:50,619
Towards the lower right
is the so-called <i>US segment</i>

215
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,573
and we have also the <i>Columbus
European Laboratory</i>

216
00:13:54,584 --> 00:13:57,251
and the Japanese laboratory, <i>Kibo,</i>

217
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:01,093
with the external pallets,
Japanese external pallet and a robot arm.

218
00:14:01,094 --> 00:14:04,961
And we have a large truss
with solar panels.

219
00:14:04,962 --> 00:14:10,197
This is all constituting
the so-called US Segment.

220
00:14:10,198 --> 00:14:14,034
In addition to the solar panels,
we have a certain number of features here

221
00:14:14,035 --> 00:14:17,103
which we will see later
on another illustration,

222
00:14:17,104 --> 00:14:18,386
which are radiators.

223
00:14:18,387 --> 00:14:23,249
These are also radiators
in order to radiate into space

224
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:27,375
through an ammonia loop 
of the heat that is created

225
00:14:27,476 --> 00:14:32,715
by all the avionics equipment on board:
the electric equipment and also the crew.

226
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:35,733
The Aft portion
is really the Russian segment,

227
00:14:35,902 --> 00:14:41,064
so with Zarya and Zvezda,
and a number of other modules,

228
00:14:41,065 --> 00:14:44,762
In fact, some depicted in red,

229
00:14:44,763 --> 00:14:48,292
extra module that will be added
over the next few years.

230
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:53,699
So this is excluding 
the red parts on the far left,

231
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:59,684
the Station constitution 
as it was in May 2015.

232
00:15:00,443 --> 00:15:04,090
This is an artist's view
of what the Station will be in 2017

233
00:15:04,091 --> 00:15:08,118
so this is after the addition
of the extra module from Russia

234
00:15:08,119 --> 00:15:10,194
which will be brought 
by the Proton rocket.

235
00:15:10,195 --> 00:15:14,121
By the way, there will be also
an extra robot arm on the Russian side

236
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,807
which is a European robot arm.

237
00:15:15,808 --> 00:15:19,099
There's a cooperation between Europe ESA

238
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:24,612
and the aerospace industry in Europe
and the Russians to provide this facility

239
00:15:24,613 --> 00:15:28,946
for management of the equipment
in the Aft part of the space station,

240
00:15:28,947 --> 00:15:30,361
the Russian segment.

241
00:15:30,362 --> 00:15:34,643
But again here you see clearly
the larger truss, the solar arrays

242
00:15:34,805 --> 00:15:38,356
and the radiators,
some of them hanging down

243
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:41,068
and the other trailing behind.

244
00:15:41,069 --> 00:15:47,293
The velocity vector of the Space Station
on this drawing is to the left and up,

245
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:50,837
generally speaking,
in this direction here.

246
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:55,605
Lat but not the least
the Chinese Space Station

247
00:15:55,606 --> 00:15:57,888
which was launched in 2011.

248
00:15:57,889 --> 00:16:01,233
This is a completely autonomous effort
by the Chinese

249
00:16:01,234 --> 00:16:04,898
to have their own space station,
visited by their own crew

250
00:16:04,899 --> 00:16:07,124
with their own visiting vehicle.

251
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:13,626
So you have the station itself here,
the Tiangong 1, a relatively small station

252
00:16:13,662 --> 00:16:18,875
not occupied permanently
but only visited on a few occasions.

253
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:25,245
And here you have their Shenzhou vehicle
which has the re-entry part here,

254
00:16:25,246 --> 00:16:27,096
it has the over-all vehicle here.

255
00:16:27,097 --> 00:16:31,058
And this is the service module
of the Shenzhou spacecraft.

256
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:35,875
Again, a completely
autonomous development of the Chinese.

257
00:16:35,876 --> 00:16:39,168
And we had three Shenzhou visits

258
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:43,549
to the Tiangong 1 Space Station in 2011,

259
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:50,021
Shenzhou 8, in 2012 Shenzhou 9
in 2013 Shenzhou 10.

260
00:16:50,022 --> 00:16:55,845
Now it's planned into 2015 to see Shenzhou
or rather Tiangong 1 replaced

261
00:16:55,846 --> 00:16:57,865
by another bigger space station.

262
00:16:57,866 --> 00:17:02,137
The Chinese had clearly ambitions
to expand in their capabilities

263
00:17:02,138 --> 00:17:05,281
to do space exploration
in low Earth orbit.

264
00:17:05,282 --> 00:17:08,890
They've had also
space walking capabilities

265
00:17:08,891 --> 00:17:10,403
that was demonstrated,

266
00:17:10,404 --> 00:17:13,659
and their ambitions 
are quite large in this area.

267
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:17,001
Also, obviously in space missions

268
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:20,837
outside of the vicinity of the Earth

269
00:17:20,838 --> 00:17:23,752
beyond the low Earth orbit to the Moon,
and possibly to Mars.
