1
00:00:05,625 --> 00:00:06,662
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:07,584 --> 00:00:11,397
Very warm welcome to the course on
space mission design and operations.

3
00:00:11,622 --> 00:00:14,922
We'll be together for a few weeks
and I look forward to delivering the

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,252
course and hopefully you will enjoy
it and learn something useful for

5
00:00:19,808 --> 00:00:22,808
your current work or
your future career.

6
00:00:23,638 --> 00:00:26,163
Now this is an introduction course on

7
00:00:27,124 --> 00:00:34,261
the design of a space mission and
the various elements that come into

8
00:00:34,338 --> 00:00:38,163
a space mission in terms of energy,
trajectory and how to reach a

9
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:42,846
certain goal in space whether it's
in the solar system or beyond the

10
00:00:42,936 --> 00:00:47,711
solar system or an orbit around the
earth which is the case of most of

11
00:00:47,842 --> 00:00:52,592
the space mission whether it's
for utilitarian purposes like

12
00:00:52,713 --> 00:00:58,188
earth observation or communication
or precise navigation or whether

13
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,124
it's for exploration and science.

14
00:01:01,114 --> 00:01:03,114
Now this is going to be
a concept course.

15
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:05,517
There won't be too
much mathematics.

16
00:01:06,004 --> 00:01:11,029
If you know how to add, subtract,
multiply and divide, it's fine.

17
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:13,090
That's a prerequisite obviously.

18
00:01:13,797 --> 00:01:16,447
There will be some
algebraic expressions.

19
00:01:16,574 --> 00:01:20,711
There will be some derivatives and
some integrals but not complex maths.

20
00:01:21,516 --> 00:01:23,403
It's more a concept course.

21
00:01:23,477 --> 00:01:28,015
You need to understand concepts
that are important in the frame of

22
00:01:28,859 --> 00:01:34,309
the space missions and if you have
a good root on these concepts,

23
00:01:34,372 --> 00:01:37,910
this will help you take more
advanced courses on space

24
00:01:37,993 --> 00:01:39,431
technology in the future.

25
00:01:40,354 --> 00:01:46,616
The prerequisites are basically a
bachelors degree in either science

26
00:01:46,739 --> 00:01:49,364
or engineering or medicine
for that matter.

27
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:55,027
Basic knowledge of physics
and especially mechanics.

28
00:01:55,135 --> 00:01:58,498
The Laws of Newton for
instance and common sense.

29
00:01:58,577 --> 00:02:02,289
Common sense would obviously be
required to solve the various problems.

30
00:02:02,361 --> 00:02:06,086
There will always be quizzes and
exercises associated with each of

31
00:02:06,151 --> 00:02:10,076
the lessons and you will have to
use common sense obviously.

32
00:02:10,643 --> 00:02:15,818
Now we have heard what we use to
have as a logo of the course over

33
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,857
the past for years and you have
several pictures that illustrate

34
00:02:20,252 --> 00:02:22,114
sections of the course.

35
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:28,291
On the upper right you have the
space shuttle, in fact, flying over

36
00:02:28,413 --> 00:02:32,501
the city of Zurich in Switzerland
which is the largest city in my

37
00:02:32,584 --> 00:02:38,859
my home country and this picture
was taken on a shuttle mission 114

38
00:02:39,064 --> 00:02:43,664
which was the first shuttle mission
following the COLUMBIA accident

39
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:44,920
in 2003.

40
00:02:45,276 --> 00:02:50,238
The picture was taken in the summer
of 2005 and it was taken from the

41
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,437
International Space Station looking
down at the space shuttle

42
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:56,229
shortly before the docking
of the shuttle with the

43
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:58,281
International Space Station

44
00:02:58,354 --> 00:03:02,666
and this picture illustrates one
important section of the course.

45
00:03:02,764 --> 00:03:07,477
It's about orbits, whether it's
orbits around the earth or orbits

46
00:03:07,665 --> 00:03:09,278
beyond the earth vicinity.

47
00:03:10,443 --> 00:03:15,406
We'll talk about special orbits like
the geostationary orbits and the

48
00:03:15,518 --> 00:03:16,693
sun-synchronous orbits.

49
00:03:16,804 --> 00:03:19,104
We'll talk about the
Lagrange points also.

50
00:03:20,236 --> 00:03:23,461
The Sun-Earth system or the
Earth-Moon system.

51
00:03:23,961 --> 00:03:28,023
We'll also talk about rendezvous,
obviously when we have the shuttle

52
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:31,457
coming close to the International
Space Station we have to execute

53
00:03:31,593 --> 00:03:33,194
a rendezvous with ISS.

54
00:03:34,144 --> 00:03:36,394
It was the same with the
Hubble Space Telescope.

55
00:03:36,525 --> 00:03:39,451
That's going to be an important
section of the course.

56
00:03:39,597 --> 00:03:42,472
The rendezvous in Low Earth Orbit.

57
00:03:42,844 --> 00:03:44,569
We talk about orbital maneuvers.

58
00:03:44,769 --> 00:03:48,982
What happens if you do delta-v,
a vectorial delta-v on your orbit?

59
00:03:49,137 --> 00:03:50,812
What will be the change of the orbit?

60
00:03:50,911 --> 00:03:54,985
Whether it's in inclination,
in energy of the orbit,

61
00:03:55,116 --> 00:03:57,041
the altitude or apogee or perigee.

62
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:59,046
We'll talk about all of this.

63
00:04:00,817 --> 00:04:03,129
In the bottom you have 2 pictures.

64
00:04:04,643 --> 00:04:09,043
The lower right is showing a space
craft in the vicinity of Saturn.

65
00:04:09,094 --> 00:04:11,106
This is the Cassini space craft.

66
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:14,921
It's a NASA space craft on orbit
around the ringed planet.

67
00:04:14,975 --> 00:04:19,050
Studying the planet itself, the
rings and some of the 60 satellites

68
00:04:19,103 --> 00:04:20,328
we have around Saturn.

69
00:04:20,966 --> 00:04:25,116
And on the lower left you have
a rover on the surface of Mars

70
00:04:25,312 --> 00:04:28,237
and that's going to be another
important section of the course.

71
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,958
Interplanetary trajectories.

72
00:04:30,118 --> 00:04:32,755
How to leave the vicinity of
the earth to go towards

73
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,900
the outer Solar System.

74
00:04:34,938 --> 00:04:39,176
Mars, Jupiter or Saturn or the
inner solar system towards

75
00:04:39,367 --> 00:04:41,392
Mercury or Venus.

76
00:04:41,486 --> 00:04:45,361
What is the strategy and what
other calculations we can make?

77
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:49,968
Relatively simple calculations to
determine the energy respective of

78
00:04:50,089 --> 00:04:54,089
the propellant needed to go to
various places in the Solar System.

79
00:04:54,129 --> 00:04:58,791
We'll simplify the problem in the
sense that will consider the

80
00:04:58,841 --> 00:05:03,828
departure situation where we have
a planetocentric trajectory of our

81
00:05:03,917 --> 00:05:07,256
space craft in the vicinity of the
earth which is a departure planet.

82
00:05:07,552 --> 00:05:10,164
Then we have, when we leave
the vicinity of the earth,

83
00:05:10,273 --> 00:05:12,323
we have a heliocentric trajectory.

84
00:05:13,008 --> 00:05:18,295
Basically an elliptic path either to
the outer or inner Solar System.

85
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:23,854
And when we come in the vicinity of
the destination planet, then we can

86
00:05:23,989 --> 00:05:26,952
forget about the sun and we
consider the 2 body problem of the

87
00:05:27,054 --> 00:05:30,204
space craft with respect to
the destination planet

88
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:33,190
and then we look into
various situations.

89
00:05:33,274 --> 00:05:37,237
Either go directly to the
planet and land on it

90
00:05:37,374 --> 00:05:39,487
or possibly come into orbit
around the planet.

91
00:05:39,635 --> 00:05:45,361
We'll look at energy and strategy
considerations in order to achieve

92
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,525
one or the other goal.

93
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:51,046
On the upper left you
have rockets and

94
00:05:51,096 --> 00:05:56,571
this is going to be the section of
the course on propulsion on one hand

95
00:05:56,771 --> 00:06:00,559
and rocket equations will be derived

96
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:04,296
or the Tsiolkovsky equation
which will give you the

97
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:07,719
change and velocity that you have
if you use a certain amount of

98
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:10,689
propellants with a certain
efficiency of the propulsion system

99
00:06:10,778 --> 00:06:13,891
to go from one place
to the other in space.

100
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:20,979
We'll talk about the ascent into
space with a single rockets

101
00:06:21,015 --> 00:06:25,340
or with multistage rockets and we
will derive the benefit that you

102
00:06:25,383 --> 00:06:28,633
have if you have several stages in
the rocket and you get rid of the

103
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:34,071
heavy element with empty tanks that
have been used as you go up in space.

104
00:06:35,799 --> 00:06:41,474
There will also be a small section
on space craft system, mainly on

105
00:06:41,530 --> 00:06:45,530
attitude control because this is
some what related to the chapter

106
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:49,403
on propulsion because we use very
often thrusters in order to control

107
00:06:49,466 --> 00:06:51,054
the attitude of the space craft.

108
00:06:51,102 --> 00:06:54,690
That was a case for the space
shuttle for instance and also for

109
00:06:54,746 --> 00:06:58,284
the Russian segment of the
International Space Station.

110
00:06:58,859 --> 00:07:03,209
There will be a very small section
on other systems on a space craft

111
00:07:03,232 --> 00:07:06,507
like the electrical power generation
and distribution system

112
00:07:06,582 --> 00:07:11,182
but there will be no detailed
description of other systems aboard

113
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:14,565
a space craft like the data handling
system or communication system.

114
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:15,772
This will not be covered.

115
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:18,686
This will be covered
in other courses.

116
00:07:20,093 --> 00:07:23,206
And in the middle you have an
astronaut with a power tool

117
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:26,218
working in the payload bay
of the space shuttle.

118
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:31,822
It happens to be me on a space walk
I did in December 1999 on my last

119
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:35,394
space flight on the shuttle when we
had a rendezvous with the Hubble

120
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:38,312
Space Telescope and we
did some repairs on it

121
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:40,862
and this illustrates the last
section of the course

122
00:07:40,953 --> 00:07:44,329
which will be on human space
flight and especially I'll talk

123
00:07:44,397 --> 00:07:49,836
about space walking, about the life
conditions on board the space ship

124
00:07:49,927 --> 00:07:53,102
and also when you are space
walking and the various physical

125
00:07:53,123 --> 00:07:56,060
and psychological conditions you
have while space walking.

126
00:07:56,725 --> 00:07:58,263
I'll talk about the tools we use.

127
00:07:58,388 --> 00:08:01,500
I'll talk about the robotics system
that is used in conjunction with

128
00:08:01,655 --> 00:08:05,755
space walking to do some work
in space whether it was the

129
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:09,236
assembly of the International Space
Station which is completed of course

130
00:08:09,377 --> 00:08:13,365
or whether it was to do work on
the Hubble Space Telescope

131
00:08:13,415 --> 00:08:17,190
to do either repair, maintenance or
exchange scientific instruments.

132
00:08:18,405 --> 00:08:24,093
At the very end I will talk about
the future as well as robotic

133
00:08:24,203 --> 00:08:29,016
and manned space exploration
programs and the future of

134
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,151
manned space programs also.

135
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:34,426
With the idea of leaving the
low Earth orbit which we have

136
00:08:34,513 --> 00:08:37,588
covered a lot over the last
few year since the end of

137
00:08:37,645 --> 00:08:41,257
Apollo program and going back
to the Solar System, to the moon

138
00:08:41,298 --> 00:08:45,111
and to Mars and possibly other
destinations in the Solar System.

139
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:48,552
That's going to be it for the course
and I look forward to delivering it

140
00:08:48,637 --> 00:08:50,825
and hopefully you will
have fun taking it.

141
00:08:50,885 --> 00:08:51,997
Take care.
