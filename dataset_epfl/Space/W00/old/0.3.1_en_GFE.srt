00:00:05,536 --> 00:00:09,373
Welcome to the course
on Space mission design and operations.

2
00:00:09,373 --> 00:00:11,236
This is the introduction to the course,

3
00:00:11,236 --> 00:00:15,721
and we'll tell you about the style
of the course, the spirit of the course,

4
00:00:15,721 --> 00:00:21,474
and I'll be using this set of pictures
that you see here,

5
00:00:21,474 --> 00:00:25,393
which was in fact the logo
of the course over the past few years,

6
00:00:25,393 --> 00:00:29,084
in order to illustrate
the various sections of the course.

7
00:00:29,084 --> 00:00:31,492
First of all, this is going to be
a concept course.

8
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:33,955
The idea is really
to understand concepts.

9
00:00:33,955 --> 00:00:36,900
There will be little deep calculation.

10
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,361
You can forget about Matlab,
you can just use your head,

11
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:42,436
your brain, and maybe a calculator.

12
00:00:42,436 --> 00:00:45,539
There will be only
relatively simple calculations,

13
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:48,206
but I would like you
to understand <i>concepts</i>

14
00:00:48,206 --> 00:00:50,855
of space exploration
and utilization of space.

15
00:00:51,825 --> 00:00:54,007
So, let's look at these pictures.

16
00:00:54,007 --> 00:00:57,797
Here we have the Space Shuttle
on low Earth orbit.

17
00:00:57,797 --> 00:01:01,122
This picture was taken
in the summer of 2005,

18
00:01:01,122 --> 00:01:04,565
on Space Shuttle Mission STS-114,

19
00:01:04,565 --> 00:01:06,819
which, by the way,
was commanded by a woman.

20
00:01:06,819 --> 00:01:09,877
Eileen Collins was the commander
of that mission.

21
00:01:09,877 --> 00:01:12,753
A picture taken
from the International Space Station

22
00:01:12,753 --> 00:01:17,398
shortly before the docking
of the Shuttle to ISS.

23
00:01:17,398 --> 00:01:21,074
This is just to...
in fact, the Shuttle, at this time,

24
00:01:21,074 --> 00:01:23,661
is flying over Zurich, Switzerland.

25
00:01:23,661 --> 00:01:28,148
So, this picture is very dear to my heart,
it's over my home country.

26
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:29,974
This is just to illustrate the fact

27
00:01:29,974 --> 00:01:33,643
that we'll talk a lot
about trajectories and orbits,

28
00:01:33,643 --> 00:01:37,200
and orbital changes, maneuvers,
changes of inclination,

29
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,798
changes of attitude of the orbit.

30
00:01:39,798 --> 00:01:42,103
And, a picture taken from ISS,

31
00:01:42,103 --> 00:01:45,410
so obviously there was a rendezvous
of the Space Shuttle with ISS.

32
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:47,864
There will be one pretty big section
in the course

33
00:01:47,864 --> 00:01:50,386
about rendezvous in low Earth orbit.

34
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:52,613
And this was valid for the Space Shuttle,

35
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,805
and the Hubble Space Telescope,
for instance,

36
00:01:54,805 --> 00:01:57,620
the International Space Station,
for many, many missions,

37
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:01,079
<i>until</i> the Shuttle was retired in 2011,

38
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,593
and, of course, it still is the case
for Soyuz rendezvous

39
00:02:04,593 --> 00:02:08,487
with the International Space Station,
to bring personnel there,

40
00:02:08,487 --> 00:02:13,581
or resupply spacecraft
from the various nations

41
00:02:13,581 --> 00:02:17,498
that also have to perform automatic
rendezvous with the Space Shuttle.

42
00:02:17,498 --> 00:02:24,181
So, low Earth orbit, orbital changes,
maneuvers and rendezvous.

43
00:02:24,181 --> 00:02:27,096
Now, in the lower right and lower left,

44
00:02:27,096 --> 00:02:33,247
you have illustrations of exploration
of the solar system, using either probes,

45
00:02:33,247 --> 00:02:36,903
on the lower right, here,

46
00:02:36,903 --> 00:02:40,116
you have the Cassini spacecraft
on orbit around Saturn,

47
00:02:40,116 --> 00:02:44,259
since many years
a very successful mission,

48
00:02:44,259 --> 00:02:49,154
and on the lower left here,
you have a robot on the surface of Mars.

49
00:02:49,154 --> 00:02:51,538
There has been a whole series
of robots on Mars.

50
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:56,476
Presently we have Curiosity still active
on the surface of the Red Planet.

51
00:02:56,476 --> 00:03:00,081
So this is going to be a pretty important
section of the course also,

52
00:03:00,351 --> 00:03:05,360
the missions to other targets
in the solar system,

53
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:07,522
whether it's planets or satellites,

54
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:10,851
and we'll look at strategies
to leave the Earth's vicinity

55
00:03:10,851 --> 00:03:15,337
and go towards Mars, or Venus,
or Jupiter, or Saturn,

56
00:03:15,337 --> 00:03:18,169
on a heliocentric trajectory for a while,

57
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:20,317
but when we are
in the vicinity of the Earth,

58
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:21,913
we have to handle it differently,

59
00:03:21,913 --> 00:03:24,173
and when we are close
to the destination planet,

60
00:03:24,173 --> 00:03:26,100
we also have to make
a special treatment.

61
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,679
We'll cover all of that.

62
00:03:27,679 --> 00:03:31,557
Now, in the upper left,
you have a rocket going into space.

63
00:03:31,557 --> 00:03:35,386
There will be a chapter on propulsion,
and the rocket equation.

64
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:38,317
We'll talk about
the ascent into space,

65
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:42,661
we'll cover the case
of the multistage rocket,

66
00:03:42,661 --> 00:03:46,345
in order to reach the orbit
in a more efficient manner

67
00:03:46,345 --> 00:03:48,528
than if you had only one rocket.

68
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:53,205
We'll talk about attitude control
of spacecraft

69
00:03:53,205 --> 00:03:56,082
we will not cover in detail
spacecraft systems,

70
00:03:56,082 --> 00:04:01,197
this is a course on mission design
and not so much on spacecraft design.

71
00:04:01,197 --> 00:04:04,132
Spacecraft design is covered
in other courses.

72
00:04:04,912 --> 00:04:08,024
And, last but not least,
in the middle we have a spacewalker.

73
00:04:08,024 --> 00:04:12,131
It happens to be me,
on 23rd of December, 1999,

74
00:04:12,131 --> 00:04:14,962
when I was on my last mission, STS-103,

75
00:04:14,962 --> 00:04:17,969
a Shuttle mission
to the Hubble Space Telescope.

76
00:04:17,969 --> 00:04:20,409
We did some repair work on Hubble.

77
00:04:20,409 --> 00:04:23,841
At the end fo the course, I'll cover
specifically human spaceflight,

78
00:04:23,841 --> 00:04:26,886
the conditions of life
on board a spaceship,

79
00:04:26,886 --> 00:04:29,781
whether it's a Shuttle
or the International Space Station,

80
00:04:29,781 --> 00:04:33,366
and there will be sections also
on robotics used on the Shuttle,

81
00:04:33,366 --> 00:04:36,934
and on ISS, and also on spacewalking.

82
00:04:36,934 --> 00:04:39,475
Anyway, have fun on this course.
