1
00:00:06,167 --> 00:00:07,918
Space activities in the world:

2
00:00:08,446 --> 00:00:10,214
you have a map of the whole world

3
00:00:10,215 --> 00:00:14,154
with a color code
for the space activities.

4
00:00:14,154 --> 00:00:17,592
In fact, in green, are the highest levels 
of activities.

5
00:00:17,593 --> 00:00:22,546
In pale green, you have
for Europe and for Canada.

6
00:00:22,547 --> 00:00:24,041
You have operates space stations,

7
00:00:24,041 --> 00:00:26,538
operates extraterrestrial probes,

8
00:00:26,539 --> 00:00:28,892
launch capability and operates satellites.

9
00:00:29,602 --> 00:00:31,651
A little bit darker green

10
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:34,665
is the case for Russia and for China.

11
00:00:34,665 --> 00:00:37,322
You have in addition, manned spaceflight

12
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:38,624
and by this, we mean,

13
00:00:38,624 --> 00:00:40,979
the capability to launch people
into space,

14
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:43,642
which is obviously the case for Russia
since a long time,

15
00:00:43,642 --> 00:00:46,105
even the first man in space

16
00:00:46,105 --> 00:00:49,750
was from the Soviet Union in 1961

17
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:51,360
Yuri Gagarin;

18
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,812
but you also have 
these capabilities in China,

19
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:58,212
independently of the operators
of the International Space Station.

20
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:01,340
In very dark green, you have Unites States

21
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,593
because in addition, and these are
the only ones to have that,

22
00:01:04,595 --> 00:01:07,018
is manned-extraterrestrial exploration

23
00:01:07,019 --> 00:01:11,735
because of the Apollo Program,
an exploration to the Moon, in the 60s.

24
00:01:12,676 --> 00:01:15,923
NASA is obviously a major space agency

25
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:17,838
in the United States.

26
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:22,075
It's National Aeronautics
and Space Administration,

27
00:01:22,076 --> 00:01:24,566
sometimes we forget the aeronautics.

28
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:27,667
We have the feeling that it's only
a space administration

29
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:31,285
but it has a very important 
aviation segment also.

30
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:34,231
Established in 1958
by President Eisenhower,

31
00:01:34,232 --> 00:01:37,974
this is also the year that the US Center,
the first satellite,

32
00:01:37,974 --> 00:01:39,632
Explorer I entered orbit.

33
00:01:39,632 --> 00:01:42,842
This is the beginning of the 1958,

34
00:01:42,843 --> 00:01:46,703
a few months after the launch
of the Sputnik by the Soviets.

35
00:01:47,033 --> 00:01:50,321
The current administrator
is Charlie Bolden,

36
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:52,827
who happens to be a classmate of mine.

37
00:01:52,828 --> 00:01:55,468
He was part of the group nine
of US astronauts,

38
00:01:55,469 --> 00:01:57,578
that started training in 1980

39
00:01:57,578 --> 00:01:59,583
at the Johnson Space Center Houston,

40
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:02,387
and they were two Europeans
that joined that group,

41
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,662
Wubbo Ockels and myself.

42
00:02:05,353 --> 00:02:08,181
Here we see the mission directorates 
of NASA.

43
00:02:09,043 --> 00:02:11,307
I mentioned already
Aeronautics research.

44
00:02:11,308 --> 00:02:14,737
Sometimes forgotten,
but an important segment,

45
00:02:14,737 --> 00:02:16,391
human exploration and operations,

46
00:02:16,392 --> 00:02:18,667
science, and space technology.

47
00:02:18,668 --> 00:02:21,666
The budget of NASA has been
pretty steady.

48
00:02:22,447 --> 00:02:27,439
We can see the value for 2016:
18.5 billion US dollars,

49
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:29,420
and the projection over the next few years

50
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:31,550
is a very, very slow increase.

51
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:36,208
It's still about or less that 1%
of the federal budget.

52
00:02:36,859 --> 00:02:40,001
Now the NASA Centers are distributed
over the whole country,

53
00:02:40,009 --> 00:02:43,462
the headquarters is
in Washington, D.C.,

54
00:02:44,153 --> 00:02:48,221
the centers a distributed
pretty much on the East Coast,

55
00:02:48,222 --> 00:02:49,485
a number of them,

56
00:02:49,485 --> 00:02:50,826
but also, on the West Coast,

57
00:02:50,826 --> 00:02:56,249
and in the Middle states, you have
the Johnson Space Center Houston.

58
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:00,541
Obviously a significant center
for the human space flight:

59
00:03:00,542 --> 00:03:04,124
Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Alabama,

60
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:09,233
that's where the development
of the Saturn V rocket was made

61
00:03:09,234 --> 00:03:11,982
by von Braun and his team.

62
00:03:12,417 --> 00:03:15,347
And for human space flight,
obviously, very important,

63
00:03:15,347 --> 00:03:18,386
is the launch site of 
the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.

64
00:03:19,292 --> 00:03:23,334
The landing sites of the Space Shuttle
were normally Kennedy Space Center,

65
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:26,837
the same location as the launch site
for obvious reasons,

66
00:03:26,837 --> 00:03:29,529
but sometimes, we had a landing
at Edwards,

67
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,094
whenever the weather
was unsuitable in Florida,

68
00:03:32,094 --> 00:03:36,793
or we had once at Whitesands facility 
in New Mexico.

69
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:41,452
The European Space Agency
was created in 1975,

70
00:03:41,452 --> 00:03:44,282
on the basis of two existing agencies

71
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:48,666
which were the European Space
Research Organization, ESRO,

72
00:03:48,667 --> 00:03:51,544
and ELDO, European Launch
and Development Organization.

73
00:03:52,323 --> 00:03:57,086
These two organizations
that existed already in the late 60s,

74
00:03:58,297 --> 00:04:02,852
came together in 1975
to form the European Space Agency.

75
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:06,166
At the present time, we have

76
00:04:07,077 --> 00:04:09,834
the Director General
Johann Dietrich Woerner

77
00:04:09,841 --> 00:04:11,190
from Germany.

78
00:04:11,191 --> 00:04:12,921
We have 22 members states;

79
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:14,557
has been steadily increasing

80
00:04:14,557 --> 00:04:17,496
from the creation in 1975 until now,

81
00:04:17,496 --> 00:04:21,125
and our cooperation agreements
with Canada, Bulgaria, Cyprus,

82
00:04:21,128 --> 00:04:23,022
Lithuania, and Malta.

83
00:04:23,971 --> 00:04:27,565
Now, each space agency has a mission

84
00:04:27,566 --> 00:04:31,229
and we didn't list the missions
of all the space agencies

85
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:35,961
but we thought it was interesting
to mention it for ESA.

86
00:04:35,962 --> 00:04:37,736
The idea is really to provide for,

87
00:04:37,736 --> 00:04:40,134
to promote for exclusively 
peaceful purposes,

88
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:42,707
and I think it's important
that everyone realizes

89
00:04:42,707 --> 00:04:47,168
that there is no military activity
within the European Space Agency.

90
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,288
Cooperation among the European
states in space research and technology

91
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:51,742
and their space applications,

92
00:04:51,742 --> 00:04:55,168
with a view to their being used
for scientific purposes

93
00:04:55,168 --> 00:04:57,746
and for operational space
applications systems.

94
00:04:58,255 --> 00:05:00,703
As far as space applications systems
are concerned,

95
00:05:00,703 --> 00:05:03,867
there is normally an early development
within ESA,

96
00:05:03,868 --> 00:05:08,381
like for communication satellite,
or weather satellite, or for launchers,

97
00:05:08,382 --> 00:05:10,082
as with Ariane series

98
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:13,796
and whenever the system is mature
for commercial application

99
00:05:13,796 --> 00:05:16,128
it goes in the hands of private companies

100
00:05:16,129 --> 00:05:19,364
like Arianespace for the operation
of the Ariane program.

101
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:21,975
But whenever there is a new development,
like Ariane 6,

102
00:05:21,975 --> 00:05:23,476
which is in development now,

103
00:05:23,476 --> 00:05:26,066
it's within the hands of ESA, 
until it's mature,

104
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:28,231
then it goes into Arianespace.

105
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:30,749
Now we have two sets of programs,

106
00:05:30,749 --> 00:05:32,454
the so-called mandatory programs,

107
00:05:32,454 --> 00:05:34,905
all member states participate
in such activities;

108
00:05:34,905 --> 00:05:38,668
the scientific program
is a mandatory program.

109
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:43,040
And optional programs like
human space flight is an optional program

110
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,526
not all of the 22 member states
have to participate in that,

111
00:05:46,526 --> 00:05:49,617
it's up to them what 
fraction of the cost

112
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:53,279
of these optional programs 
they want to put.

113
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,394
The budget is about
4.4 billion euros for 2015

114
00:05:57,395 --> 00:06:00,397
and has also been pretty steady
over the last few years,

115
00:06:00,398 --> 00:06:01,967
and slowly increasing.

116
00:06:01,967 --> 00:06:05,959
Main contributors being obviously
France, Germany, Italy, and the UK.

117
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,340
ESA centers are pretty well distributed
over Europe,

118
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,431
although not all the countries
have a center,

119
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:17,235
but headquarters is in Paris,

120
00:06:18,296 --> 00:06:23,174
and you have five major centers,
the major technological centers,

121
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:25,098
ESTEC, in Noordwijk, the Netherlands,

122
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:28,652
you have the European Astronauts Center
in Cologne, Germany,

123
00:06:29,012 --> 00:06:34,545
ESOC, the Space Operations Center
from where satellites and space probes

124
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:36,615
are being controlled;

125
00:06:36,626 --> 00:06:40,876
ESRIN, this is a documentation center
in Frascati, Italy, near Rome.

126
00:06:40,877 --> 00:06:44,001
And finally, you have the ESAC,

127
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:50,209
it's an Astronomy Center in
Villanueva de la Cañada, in Spain.

128
00:06:50,731 --> 00:06:54,360
So headquarters in Paris,
and five major centers

129
00:06:54,361 --> 00:06:55,998
distributed over Europe.

130
00:06:56,792 --> 00:07:00,893
Roscosmos: this is 
the Russian Space Agency.

131
00:07:00,893 --> 00:07:03,352
In fact, the name was simply Roscosmos

132
00:07:03,353 --> 00:07:05,679
before, until the end of 2015,

133
00:07:05,679 --> 00:07:08,273
then there was a change of name.

134
00:07:08,713 --> 00:07:11,706
Roscosmos State Corporation, right now.

135
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:14,499
Director General is Igor Komarov,

136
00:07:14,499 --> 00:07:18,476
and you see the budget is established
over 10 years,

137
00:07:18,476 --> 00:07:22,664
and we see that is approximately
1/10th of the budget of NASA. Headquarters

138
00:07:22,665 --> 00:07:24,091
in Moscow.

139
00:07:24,091 --> 00:07:27,316
Main launch sites are Plesetsk
and Baikonur.

140
00:07:27,316 --> 00:07:30,754
Baikonur has been used for all
the Soyuz launches

141
00:07:30,754 --> 00:07:34,418
to send personnel into
the International Space Station

142
00:07:34,418 --> 00:07:37,819
and right now this is the only way
to get to the International Space Station

143
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:41,164
since the Shuttle was retired in 2011.

144
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:44,278
There is a future launch site
that is being developed by the Russians.

145
00:07:44,278 --> 00:07:46,156
It's Vostochny,

146
00:07:46,157 --> 00:07:49,451
in the south-east of the country.

147
00:07:49,459 --> 00:07:53,678
The idea for Russia is not to be
depending on Kazakhstan,

148
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:56,561
because Baikonur is not in Russia
but in Kazakhstan.

149
00:07:56,804 --> 00:08:01,080
And Vostochny should be operational
in a couple of years from now.

150
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:06,248
Canadian Space Agency, this is quite
an important space agency,

151
00:08:06,249 --> 00:08:09,776
within the frame of 
the International Space Station.

152
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:13,045
And we mentioned already the contribution
also to the Shuttle Program

153
00:08:13,046 --> 00:08:17,499
in the delivery and the operation
of the robot arm.

154
00:08:17,918 --> 00:08:21,447
Established in the 1989, Sylvain Laporte,

155
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:23,361
is the President;

156
00:08:23,362 --> 00:08:27,800
the budget: 483 million Canadian dollars
in 2015.

157
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:31,542
JAXA, the Japanese Aerospace
eXploration Agency

158
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:33,032
established in 2003,

159
00:08:33,032 --> 00:08:35,331
President Naoki Okumura.

160
00:08:35,398 --> 00:08:41,374
And we see the budget of about
1.3 billion US dollars per year.

161
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:46,741
Tokyo headquarters, main launch sites
Tsukuba and Tanegashima.

162
00:08:47,352 --> 00:08:52,188
And again, another major contributor
to the International Space Station

163
00:08:52,189 --> 00:08:56,424
together with the Europe, ESA
specifically,

164
00:08:56,424 --> 00:08:58,394
and the Canadian Space Agency.

165
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:01,533
Now, we have covered until now,

166
00:09:01,533 --> 00:09:05,518
all the agencies that are involved
in the International Space Station

167
00:09:05,518 --> 00:09:08,912
but we have two other major space agencies

168
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:11,889
and I would say, rising space powers

169
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:16,226
which are India and China.

170
00:09:16,436 --> 00:09:19,720
And India has an Indian Space 
Research Organization.

171
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:23,168
The original space program of India

172
00:09:23,174 --> 00:09:26,494
was mainly, to serve the people
with telecommunications,

173
00:09:26,501 --> 00:09:31,668
and mainly, telecommunications,
Earth resources.

174
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,829
They have developed their own launchers,

175
00:09:33,829 --> 00:09:35,702
so they are able
to launch their own satellites

176
00:09:35,702 --> 00:09:39,500
from a launch site
in the South East of the country

177
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:41,791
Satish Dhawan.

178
00:09:41,792 --> 00:09:44,844
India has been going beyond

179
00:09:44,844 --> 00:09:46,740
the practical utilization of space,

180
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:50,219
and they've developed
interplanetary probes;

181
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,580
one to the Moon, which is Chandrayaan,

182
00:09:53,581 --> 00:09:55,830
which was successfully launched
a few years ago,

183
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:59,867
and more recently, a probe
that was sent to Mars, Mangalyaan.

184
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:04,287
So, slowly, India
is getting into space science

185
00:10:04,287 --> 00:10:06,609
and there are also plans
for human space flight

186
00:10:06,609 --> 00:10:11,603
developed by the means of India
over the next few years.

187
00:10:12,501 --> 00:10:15,248
For China, we have the China National 
Space Administration,

188
00:10:15,248 --> 00:10:17,594
quite a powerful administration,

189
00:10:17,594 --> 00:10:20,497
and a very lively space program.

190
00:10:20,985 --> 00:10:24,534
Also, remarkable capabilities
in human spaceflight

191
00:10:24,534 --> 00:10:27,917
with the Shenzhou, the ascend
and descend vehicle

192
00:10:27,923 --> 00:10:31,503
and Tiangong-1, and more to follow,

193
00:10:32,514 --> 00:10:35,635
space station on low orbit
around the Earth.

194
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:38,209
Four launch sites, headquarters in Beijing,

195
00:10:38,209 --> 00:10:41,873
for the CNSA,
China National Space Administration.

196
00:10:42,968 --> 00:10:46,599
Now, we have a number of national
space agencies in Europe,

197
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,516
specifically in France, in Germany,

198
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:53,048
in Italy, and in the UK.

199
00:10:53,582 --> 00:10:57,177
CNES is a French National Space Agency

200
00:10:57,177 --> 00:10:58,500
established in 61;

201
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:04,036
in Germany we have DLR,
Deutsches zentrum fur luft-und Raumfahrt,

202
00:11:04,037 --> 00:11:06,303
also responsible for
aeronautical programs,

203
00:11:06,303 --> 00:11:08,519
established in 1969.

204
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:12,766
And the Italian Space Agency, ASI,
Agenzia Spatiale Italiana,

205
00:11:12,766 --> 00:11:14,696
established in 1988.

206
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:18,262
The UK Space Agency
is a little more recent,

207
00:11:18,263 --> 00:11:20,008
established in 2010.

208
00:11:20,228 --> 00:11:22,435
As far as the human spaceflight
is concerned

209
00:11:22,435 --> 00:11:28,105
the first three agencies
that I mentioned, CNES, DLR, ASI

210
00:11:28,106 --> 00:11:30,214
had their own astronaut corps

211
00:11:30,215 --> 00:11:31,989
until the year 2000,

212
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,601
when it was decided that all of
the European astronauts

213
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:36,790
are going to belong
to the European Space Agency;

214
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,681
we don't have any more national
astronauts in Europe right now.
