1
00:00:06,663 --> 00:00:08,653
The first years of space exploration

2
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:11,583
were done in a spirit of real competition

3
00:00:11,583 --> 00:00:14,802
between the two space fairing nations 
at that time,

4
00:00:14,802 --> 00:00:17,992
which were the Soviet Union 
and the United States.

5
00:00:18,299 --> 00:00:23,222
In fact, toward the middle,
to toward the end of the 50's

6
00:00:24,092 --> 00:00:28,021
mainly the military technology 
had allowed these two nations

7
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:32,692
to develop rockets, 
which were called ICBMs -

8
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,282
intercontinental ballistic missile -

9
00:00:34,282 --> 00:00:39,242
that were soon going to be able 
to carry, first, satellites

10
00:00:39,334 --> 00:00:40,914
low-mass satellites,

11
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:42,693
and then human beings into space.

12
00:00:43,373 --> 00:00:45,193
In fact, the first one who succeeded

13
00:00:45,193 --> 00:00:47,833
to put a satellite on orbit
were the Soviets,

14
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:52,894
and this is Sputnik 1. 
Launch was on October the 4th, 1957.

15
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:56,682
It was not really a scientific satellite.

16
00:00:56,682 --> 00:00:59,527
The purpose was really
to put some mass on orbit,

17
00:00:59,527 --> 00:01:02,237
and the satellite had antennas

18
00:01:02,237 --> 00:01:05,510
and it was beaming 
a "bip, bip, bip" all the time,

19
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:08,797
which was of course 
tremendously irritating for Americans,

20
00:01:08,797 --> 00:01:10,950
because they realized 
listening to this bip, bip

21
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:14,522
that they had been beaten in this, 
of course, fundamental step

22
00:01:14,522 --> 00:01:15,862
in the space exploration,

23
00:01:15,862 --> 00:01:17,942
which is the launch 
of the first satellite,

24
00:01:17,942 --> 00:01:19,992
the first satellite on low Earth orbit.

25
00:01:20,942 --> 00:01:25,183
It followed relatively shortly afterwards 
with the Explorer 1,

26
00:01:25,183 --> 00:01:28,150
which was the first US satellite,

27
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:30,310
much smaller mass than Sputnik 1,

28
00:01:30,312 --> 00:01:33,181
however the interesting feature 
of Explorer 1

29
00:01:33,181 --> 00:01:35,101
was that it was already 
a scientific satellite.

30
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:37,878
It was launched on quite a high orbit,

31
00:01:37,878 --> 00:01:41,728
so it had a lifetime of 12 years, 
which was quite long at that time.

32
00:01:42,747 --> 00:01:46,916
It had Geiger counters, and it discovered

33
00:01:46,916 --> 00:01:48,840
that a certain height
above the Earth's surface

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,850
we had a very high radiation

35
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:55,599
or flux of particles of high energy -

36
00:01:55,599 --> 00:01:58,209
mainly protons, electrons,
we'll talk about that later -

37
00:01:58,209 --> 00:02:02,056
and it, in fact, discovered 
the Van Allen's radiation belt.

38
00:02:02,056 --> 00:02:05,248
The discovery was made 
through Explorer 1 satellite,

39
00:02:05,248 --> 00:02:09,508
the first US satellite, in early 1958.

40
00:02:10,928 --> 00:02:12,900
Both nations obviously had interest also

41
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,900
in trying to prove that they could 
bring a human into space,

42
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:19,399
but before sending humans 
the idea was to send animals

43
00:02:19,399 --> 00:02:22,583
and see whether they would 
survive the space environment.

44
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:25,645
The Russians used mainly dogs,

45
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:31,465
and they made a few sub-orbital flights 
with dogs on board, and it went fine.

46
00:02:31,465 --> 00:02:34,643
And then at some point, November 3, 1957,

47
00:02:34,643 --> 00:02:37,264
so a relatively short time
after Sputnik 1,

48
00:02:37,264 --> 00:02:43,177
they sent Sputnik 2 with Laika,
a small female dog, on board.

49
00:02:43,937 --> 00:02:45,480
There was one-way ticket for Laika.

50
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,880
It was not foreseen for her 
to return alive to Earth.

51
00:02:51,824 --> 00:02:55,043
In fact, she passed away 
not toward the end of the mission,

52
00:02:55,043 --> 00:02:56,043
but a little bit earlier

53
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:58,279
because of some 
technical problem with breathing.

54
00:02:58,279 --> 00:03:02,763
But at least there was a proof 
that a living creature, like a dog,

55
00:03:02,763 --> 00:03:04,528
could survive the space environment,

56
00:03:04,528 --> 00:03:09,098
mainly the absence of gravity condition,
or the micro-gravity conditions.

57
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,881
The Americans obviously 
were following the same path.

58
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:15,968
They were also trying to prove 
that an animal could survive in space,

59
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:17,537
but they went a little bit beyond.

60
00:03:17,537 --> 00:03:21,672
They sent a chimpanzee, Ham,
after a few other animals

61
00:03:21,672 --> 00:03:24,562
that were sent
on sub-orbital trajectories.

62
00:03:24,562 --> 00:03:26,992
They sent Ham to orbit,

63
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:30,451
and not only they wanted to prove 
that Ham was able to stay alive,

64
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:32,691
but was able to perform some tasks

65
00:03:32,691 --> 00:03:34,451
relatively simple tasks,

66
00:03:34,451 --> 00:03:38,991
but this is in a way a precursor 
to sending astronauts into orbit,

67
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:41,986
and obviously we have proven 
since that time

68
00:03:41,986 --> 00:03:45,181
that not only astronauts 
can perform a simple task

69
00:03:45,181 --> 00:03:48,489
but can be extremely productive: 
the best example is what has been done

70
00:03:48,489 --> 00:03:51,494
in the International Space Station today.

71
00:03:51,494 --> 00:03:54,741
So this is Ham coming back 
from his mission,

72
00:03:54,741 --> 00:03:58,056
short mission, on January 31, 1961,

73
00:03:58,056 --> 00:04:02,728
having proven that animals can be 
not only alive in space, but productive.

74
00:04:03,671 --> 00:04:07,189
Another first by the Soviets, 
the first man in space.

75
00:04:08,099 --> 00:04:11,850
This was a big, big news and of course 
very irritating for the Americans

76
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:14,110
who had been beaten.

77
00:04:14,110 --> 00:04:18,194
Yuri Gagarin, a young Air Force pilot,

78
00:04:18,194 --> 00:04:20,644
Soviet Air Force pilot,

79
00:04:20,644 --> 00:04:25,634
27 years of age, was sent 
on his Vostok 1 capsule

80
00:04:26,316 --> 00:04:29,586
on the 12th of April, 1961.

81
00:04:30,504 --> 00:04:34,279
This is "Cosmonaut Day," and it's really 
celebrated as well in Russia now,

82
00:04:34,279 --> 00:04:36,692
and in the United States, 
and in all the nations

83
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:39,692
where we do human astronautics,

84
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:42,510
we celebrate the 12th of April, 1961.

85
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:45,993
And the night from the 12th 
to 13th of April is "Yuri's Night,"

86
00:04:45,993 --> 00:04:50,086
and it's a wild night in Houston,
in Star City, in Moscow.

87
00:04:50,086 --> 00:04:53,639
Yuri Gagarin, extremely respected 
by all cosmonauts and astronauts today;

88
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:57,403
he opened for us the door to space.

89
00:04:57,953 --> 00:05:04,653
One orbit around the Earth 
in 108 minutes performed successfully.

90
00:05:04,653 --> 00:05:07,850
Not only he stayed alive,
but he was in good shape.

91
00:05:08,281 --> 00:05:11,677
A real hero of the human 
space program, Yuri Gagarin.

92
00:05:13,397 --> 00:05:17,207
Now, the Americans 
were not quite ready for that

93
00:05:18,227 --> 00:05:20,683
and did not have the kind of rocket

94
00:05:20,683 --> 00:05:24,693
that would allow them to bring 
an American on orbit around the Earth,

95
00:05:24,693 --> 00:05:28,112
but they had pretty rapidly to prove 
that they could at least reach space

96
00:05:28,112 --> 00:05:30,208
with a rocket and with a human on board,

97
00:05:30,208 --> 00:05:34,418
and the first US astronaut was Shepard,

98
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,323
and you see the liftoff of his rocket.

99
00:05:37,323 --> 00:05:42,583
It was a modified ICBM that was taken 
from the military, from the US Army,

100
00:05:42,689 --> 00:05:44,609
and on top of it you see a small capsule.

101
00:05:44,609 --> 00:05:46,533
This is the Mercury capsule,

102
00:05:46,533 --> 00:05:51,372
the first flight of a US astronaut, 
but sub-orbital:

103
00:05:51,372 --> 00:05:54,130
he did not go into orbit, 
but went up and down,

104
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:58,270
but at an altitude of above 100 km, 
which is considered the limit of space.

105
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:02,057
Another first by the Soviets, 
Valentina Tereshkova,

106
00:06:02,057 --> 00:06:07,837
the first woman in space, June 18, 1963.

107
00:06:08,748 --> 00:06:13,516
Quite a remarkable woman,
and she had about a three-day flight

108
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:17,799
on board the Vostok 6 space vehicle.

109
00:06:17,799 --> 00:06:19,658
And again, the Soviets had proven

110
00:06:19,658 --> 00:06:22,208
that they were able 
to make a standing first,

111
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:25,283
the first woman in space, 
Valentina Tereshkova.

112
00:06:26,243 --> 00:06:30,101
Again, another first by the Soviets,
the first spacewalk:

113
00:06:30,712 --> 00:06:35,447
Alexei Leonov, in March, 1965.

114
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,189
This was also quite a step,

115
00:06:38,189 --> 00:06:41,030
because to go out of the spaceship 
through a small airlock,

116
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,587
which happened to be 
a very, very narrow airlock,

117
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:46,286
and Alexei went out

118
00:06:46,286 --> 00:06:50,016
and was giving, by voice,
his first impressions

119
00:06:50,016 --> 00:06:52,444
of being outside the spaceship.

120
00:06:53,654 --> 00:06:55,964
It was a relatively short spacewalk 
of about 12 minutes.

121
00:06:55,964 --> 00:06:58,230
And then he tried
to go back in the airlock,

122
00:06:58,230 --> 00:06:59,606
and the airlock very narrow,

123
00:06:59,606 --> 00:07:04,026
and it looks like it was somewhat 
of an inflation of his suit as he was out.

124
00:07:04,556 --> 00:07:06,161
He could not get back in

125
00:07:06,161 --> 00:07:09,323
which was, of course,
very embarrassing and dangerous

126
00:07:09,323 --> 00:07:11,777
and he had to somewhat 
deflate his spacesuit

127
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:13,657
in order to be able 
to get through the airlock

128
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:15,737
and back in the spaceship.

129
00:07:15,737 --> 00:07:19,556
So Alexei had quite an experience

130
00:07:19,556 --> 00:07:22,807
and quite emotions 
during this first spacewalk.

131
00:07:22,807 --> 00:07:24,452
But, again, a first by the Soviets,

132
00:07:24,452 --> 00:07:28,682
and he opened the door to spacewalking,

133
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:31,305
which, of course,
has been used extensively

134
00:07:31,305 --> 00:07:34,716
and is still used extensively
for construction in space

135
00:07:34,716 --> 00:07:36,766
or maintenance 
of the Hubble Space Telescope,

136
00:07:36,766 --> 00:07:38,646
construction of the International 
Space Station

137
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:40,609
or maintenance of the station now.

138
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:43,341
So space walking has become very common,

139
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:45,333
but the first was Alexei Leonov.

140
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:50,483
Again, the Americans had to come 
quite rapidly with a counterpart,

141
00:07:50,489 --> 00:07:54,585
and that's the first US spacewalk, 
June 3, 1965,

142
00:07:54,585 --> 00:07:58,824
so relatively shortly 
after the spacewalk of Alexei Leonov.

143
00:07:58,824 --> 00:08:03,044
And, as you see, all these 
early spacewalks were using suits.

144
00:08:03,044 --> 00:08:06,568
They did not have 
the life support system in the back

145
00:08:06,568 --> 00:08:09,167
that was used of course 
for the Apollo program

146
00:08:09,167 --> 00:08:12,757
and for the Shuttle program 
and International Space Station.

147
00:08:12,757 --> 00:08:15,587
So they could stay a relatively
short time outside, on one hand.

148
00:08:15,587 --> 00:08:17,805
They had, of course, an umbilical cord

149
00:08:17,805 --> 00:08:20,963
providing all the essentials 
to stay alive.

150
00:08:20,963 --> 00:08:24,022
What is interesting also 
is that they are not holding structure.

151
00:08:24,022 --> 00:08:27,522
As well Leonov, during his spacewalk,
or Ed White, as you see here,

152
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:30,516
are not holding structure, 
they are just floating free,

153
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:34,304
but on this first US spacewalk

154
00:08:34,304 --> 00:08:38,666
Ed White had a little gun, a gas gun,

155
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:42,215
in fact it was spinning away oxygen,

156
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:45,067
and he could use his gun 
in order to maneuver himself.

157
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,378
Of course it was quite tricky,

158
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:51,798
because if you orient the nozzle 
of this hand-held gun

159
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:56,194
in such a direction that the thrust
doesn't go through a position

160
00:08:56,194 --> 00:08:58,624
close to your center of mass,
you're going to start rotating.

161
00:08:58,624 --> 00:09:01,334
But anyway he tested that,
more or less successfully,

162
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:06,054
then went back on this first
US spacewalk: Ed White.
