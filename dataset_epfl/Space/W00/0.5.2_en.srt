1
00:00:05,761 --> 00:00:07,621
Space utilization.

2
00:00:07,621 --> 00:00:11,618
There are really three main fields
of space utilization

3
00:00:11,618 --> 00:00:14,119
on one hand, for communication,

4
00:00:14,119 --> 00:00:20,085
whether it's for telephone
or voice in general,

5
00:00:20,085 --> 00:00:23,779
or high-speed internet, or TV signals,

6
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:27,103
from one country to another
in the same continent,

7
00:00:27,103 --> 00:00:29,132
or from one continent to another.

8
00:00:29,132 --> 00:00:32,201
This is a very important aspect
of space utlilization.

9
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:35,735
We have precise navigation,
with several systems in several countries

10
00:00:35,735 --> 00:00:41,005
providing very precise navigation,
typically of the order of a few meters.

11
00:00:41,005 --> 00:00:44,604
And the last important utilization

12
00:00:44,604 --> 00:00:47,025
is for observation of the Earth's surface,

13
00:00:47,025 --> 00:00:52,221
in the service of geology,
forestry, cartography,

14
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:54,715
or land use in general.

15
00:00:54,715 --> 00:00:57,045
And of course the observation
of the Earth's atmosphere,

16
00:00:57,045 --> 00:00:58,373
of the weather systems,

17
00:00:58,373 --> 00:01:01,742
whether it's for predicting
changes in climate long-term,

18
00:01:01,742 --> 00:01:04,272
or whether it's
for short-term weather forecasts.

19
00:01:05,824 --> 00:01:08,627
Communication, with a number
of commercial satellites

20
00:01:08,627 --> 00:01:11,178
used for telecommunication.

21
00:01:11,178 --> 00:01:13,855
Inmarsat is an important system
that originally -

22
00:01:13,855 --> 00:01:15,417
this was in the late '70s -

23
00:01:15,417 --> 00:01:21,166
was used specifically for maritime
communication, hence the name.

24
00:01:21,166 --> 00:01:26,502
Later, it was expanded to cover
also aeronautical communication.

25
00:01:26,502 --> 00:01:28,179
Typically, when you cross an ocean,

26
00:01:28,179 --> 00:01:31,156
you don't have direct contact on VHF
with a ground station,

27
00:01:31,156 --> 00:01:37,537
then you can use Inmarsat
for communciaton with air traffic control.

28
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:45,811
It was also expanded to cover
internet and other communication services.

29
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:52,165
At this point, we have about 15
Inmarsat satellites on orbit.

30
00:01:53,745 --> 00:01:59,141
Another aspect 
of telecommunications is Iridium.

31
00:01:59,141 --> 00:02:03,706
Iridum is a set of satellites,
about 66 satellites,

32
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:07,964
on low Earth orbit, that are used
for telephone communications.

33
00:02:07,964 --> 00:02:11,460
So, not as wide use as Inmarsat,

34
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:17,981
but it's used typically
for cell phone telecommunication.

35
00:02:19,563 --> 00:02:22,461
ViaSat is an important satellite

36
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:27,703
wtih a very high rate
of about 140 gigabits per second,

37
00:02:27,703 --> 00:02:31,135
and it's used for high-speed internet.

38
00:02:31,135 --> 00:02:36,254
Very used now, systematically used,

39
00:02:36,254 --> 00:02:38,497
for high-speed internet,
including in airplanes.

40
00:02:38,497 --> 00:02:40,756
If you have a trans-atlantic flight

41
00:02:40,756 --> 00:02:43,981
and you are in a modern airliner
where you have internet,

42
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:45,614
it's provided by ViaSat.

43
00:02:47,149 --> 00:02:52,161
Small countries also have
communication means with space platforms.

44
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:56,901
For instance, Nigcomsat is serving
the communication needs of Nigeria.

45
00:02:56,901 --> 00:03:00,620
The satellite was built in China
and launched by a Chinese launcher.

46
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:05,678
And you have other examples
like Venesat 1,

47
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:09,051
which is serving the communication needs
of the Venezuela country.

48
00:03:09,751 --> 00:03:11,306
Data relay satellites.

49
00:03:11,306 --> 00:03:13,803
These are satellites
with a high data rate,

50
00:03:13,803 --> 00:03:19,226
that are used by agencies
space agencies, like NASA for TDRS,

51
00:03:19,226 --> 00:03:24,108
and ESA for the EDRS,
European Data Relay Satellite.

52
00:03:24,108 --> 00:03:28,730
The TDRS was used in a significant manner
during the Shuttle program.

53
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,585
At that time, there were only two TDRS,
the TDRS East and TDRS West.

54
00:03:34,585 --> 00:03:37,643
And in its orbit, low Earth orbit
around the Earth,

55
00:03:37,643 --> 00:03:41,776
the Shuttle had either a view
of one of them or the other one,

56
00:03:41,776 --> 00:03:45,022
or possibly both at the same time,
and there was

57
00:03:45,022 --> 00:03:48,006
in fact, both of these satellites
were above the horizon

58
00:03:48,006 --> 00:03:52,307
for the ground station in White Sands,
in the middle of the United States.

59
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:54,965
They had a certain elevation
over White Sands,

60
00:03:54,965 --> 00:03:59,670
so there was a small region
opposite White Sands -

61
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:02,712
it was over the Indian Ocean -
where there was a loss of signal,

62
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:04,584
where the Shuttle didn't have the view

63
00:04:04,584 --> 00:04:08,728
of either one of these two
communication satellites, TDRS satellites.

64
00:04:08,728 --> 00:04:11,694
But, most of the time,
I would say 95% of the time,

65
00:04:11,694 --> 00:04:14,016
there was possibility of communicating

66
00:04:14,016 --> 00:04:18,874
between the Shuttle 
and mission control center in Houston via TDRS,

67
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:22,361
either S band, or Ku band 
for the TV signals.

68
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:27,376
Then, White Sands receiving station,
and then the signal was communicated

69
00:04:27,376 --> 00:04:29,852
to or from 
Mission Control Center

70
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,272
in Houston.

71
00:04:31,272 --> 00:04:35,644
TDRS, since the Shuttle was retired,
has been used widely for ISS,

72
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:37,269
the International Space Station

73
00:04:37,269 --> 00:04:43,362
communication from the US segment
to the ground, and also for Hubble.

74
00:04:43,362 --> 00:04:47,430
The signal from Hubble,
whether it's commanding Hubble

75
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:50,814
or receiving the scientific data
from Hubble, this is via TDRS,

76
00:04:50,814 --> 00:04:53,738
and also Landsat has been using TDRS.

77
00:04:54,992 --> 00:04:59,923
European Data Relay Satellite
is a recent baby

78
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:04,796
in fact, the first one
is being launched at this time,

79
00:05:04,796 --> 00:05:07,222
at the beginning of 2016.

80
00:05:07,222 --> 00:05:10,836
And the idea is to provide
similar services as TDRS,

81
00:05:10,836 --> 00:05:14,025
but for the European
communication needs.

82
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:15,782
What is interesting is that the link

83
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:18,615
between the satellite
that provides data to the ground,

84
00:05:18,615 --> 00:05:23,798
to the EDRS, is a laser link,
which is a new technology.

85
00:05:23,798 --> 00:05:26,997
And then, the signal from EDRS
to the ground station in Europe

86
00:05:26,997 --> 00:05:29,438
is via standard Ka or Ku band.

87
00:05:30,086 --> 00:05:33,451
Precise navigation is obviously
a very important application of space.

88
00:05:33,451 --> 00:05:35,659
Basically, the principle is the following:

89
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:39,830
If you have two satellites
visible from one given location,

90
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:43,433
and they send signals
related to their exact position,

91
00:05:43,433 --> 00:05:47,694
and precise time signals, with a <i>Δt</i>,

92
00:05:47,694 --> 00:05:52,155
a <i>Δt1</i> for the first satellite,
<i>Δt2</i> for the second satellite,

93
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:54,703
and <i>Δt3</i> for the third satellite,

94
00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:58,519
the location from the first 
satellite point of view

95
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:02,504
is on a circle 
on the surface of the Earth.

96
00:06:02,504 --> 00:06:05,094
The same for the second satellite,
same for the third,

97
00:06:05,094 --> 00:06:08,187
and the intersection
of these three circles is your position.

98
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:13,802
The constellation of communication
satellites is typically -

99
00:06:13,802 --> 00:06:18,440
this is the case for US GPS
and also for the European Galileo -

100
00:06:19,478 --> 00:06:21,501
you have six different orbits,

101
00:06:21,501 --> 00:06:25,825
with four satellites well-spread
over these orbits

102
00:06:25,825 --> 00:06:28,487
for a grand total of 24 satellites.

103
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:32,663
So, you have the US GPS in operation
since many years already,

104
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:36,987
providing a few meters of accuracy,
typically of the order of four meters.

105
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:40,234
You have an artist's view
of the Galileo system,

106
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:43,895
which is set up by the European
Space Agency and the European Union,

107
00:06:43,895 --> 00:06:46,305
a few satellites are already on orbit,

108
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,148
and their constellation
of about 30 satellites, 

109
00:06:49,148 --> 00:06:53,982
24 needed, plus a few spares, 
will be completed in 2019.

110
00:06:53,982 --> 00:06:58,311
You have other countries that also
have satellite navigation systems.

111
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:00,910
Russia has the GLONASS system,
which is operational.

112
00:07:00,910 --> 00:07:06,982
And we have also the Beidou system
in China, and IRNSS in India.

113
00:07:07,504 --> 00:07:10,094
Observation of the Earth
and its atmosphere,

114
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:12,913
obviously a very important
application of space also,

115
00:07:12,913 --> 00:07:15,386
since quite a while already.

116
00:07:15,386 --> 00:07:18,157
Landsat was an important such satellite.

117
00:07:18,157 --> 00:07:19,867
At this time we have Landsat 8,

118
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:24,175
the last one of this family
of Earth observation satellite.

119
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:29,130
You see here in picture, a picture
of Lake Poopó, which is in Bolivia,

120
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,870
south of La Paz between La Paz
and Salar de Uyuni.

121
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,768
And from year to year, this lake
is becoming dryer and dryer,

122
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:39,761
and is slowly transforming itself
into a salt lake,

123
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:42,430
and obviously it's interesting
to monitor this from space

124
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,173
and take measures if needed.

125
00:07:45,821 --> 00:07:49,359
You have another important
Earth observation satellite,

126
00:07:49,359 --> 00:07:52,150
which is Blackbridge satellite.

127
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:55,323
In fact, we have a constellation
of five such satellites,

128
00:07:55,323 --> 00:07:58,964
providing very high-resolution
pictures of the Earth

129
00:07:58,964 --> 00:08:01,462
about five meters resolution.

130
00:08:01,462 --> 00:08:05,195
This is an island,
Onekotan Island in Russia,

131
00:08:05,195 --> 00:08:08,102
just south of the Kamchatka peninsula.

132
00:08:08,102 --> 00:08:11,122
Last but not least, observation
of weather systems

133
00:08:11,122 --> 00:08:13,441
again, for climate change
and weather forecasts.

134
00:08:13,441 --> 00:08:17,994
This is a view of Europe 
and North Africa, from Meteosat.

135
00:08:17,994 --> 00:08:22,160
There was a whole family of Meteosat
satellites since many, many years.

136
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,618
Right now, we have the third generation
of Meteosats, giving us a view

137
00:08:26,618 --> 00:08:28,777
of course, it's somewhat 
of a slant view of Europe,

138
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:33,009
because it's on a geostationary 
orbit over the Equator,

139
00:08:33,009 --> 00:08:35,930
36,000 kilometers
from the Earth's surface.

140
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:38,168
And you see Europe through a slight angle,

141
00:08:38,168 --> 00:08:41,871
but it's good enough
to do a good weather forecast

142
00:08:41,871 --> 00:08:43,670
on the basis of these pictures,

143
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:45,856
which are taken in various
wavelength ranges,

144
00:08:45,856 --> 00:08:50,333
from about 0.6 micron,
which is the middle of the visible range,

145
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:54,400
all the way to about 11 microns
in the so-called thermal infrared.

146
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:59,732
So you can have really a 3-D view
of the cloud layers over Europe

147
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:02,501
and you can make really good
weather forecasts now,

148
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:06,118
compared to what we were able to do
a few decades ago.
