00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:04,149
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:04,149 --> 00:00:07,850
This course is not on
space law but I think it's still worth

3
00:00:07,850 --> 00:00:17,490
addressing a space law subject in this
video: the Outer Space Treaty of 1967.

4
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:21,519
First of all, let's ask ourselves the
question: Where does Space start?

5
00:00:21,519 --> 00:00:24,029
Space, of
course we know, is very high up there;

6
00:00:24,029 --> 00:00:28,199
where the density is nearly zero
whether it's vacuum mainly.

7
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:31,369
But if you
want to be more precise when you go up

8
00:00:31,369 --> 00:00:34,760
in the atmosphere, there is one point
where you have the boundary between the

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:37,610
atmosphere and Space.

10
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:40,350
And if you consider
an airplane flying high and high the

11
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,350
atmosphere.

12
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:47,020
It has to fly faster and
faster to compensate for the lowering of

13
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:52,490
the density in order to sustain a lift C
equal to the weight of the airplane.

14
00:00:52,490 --> 00:00:58,190
A Hungarian physicists, sir Theodore Von Kármán,
determined that for a certain height

15
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:04,750
around 100 kilometers, the velocity of an
airplane to sustain lift, is equal to

16
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:08,790
the orbital velocity and this has been
determined as being the boundary between

17
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:13,160
atmosphere and Space and the so-called
"Kármán line".

18
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:19,470
And the "Fédération Aéronotique Internationale"
- the FAI, has put that

19
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:27,380
limit as being 100 kilometers exactly or
63 miles above the Earth's surface.

20
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,470
That's where Space starts.

21
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:30,569
And if you
go above that limits, above that Kármán

22
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:31,679
line, you are an astronaut.

23
00:01:31,679 --> 00:01:34,110
So you go 101
kilometer and you have your

24
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:39,670
astronaut wings.

25
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:42,800
Let's talk about the
outer space treaty of 1967.

26
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,160
This is
during the development of the Apollo

27
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:52,869
program; and before the first moon
landing in the summer of 1969, the Treaty

28
00:01:52,869 --> 00:01:57,869
is on principles governing the
activities of States in the exploration

29
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:02,990
and use of outer space including the
moon and other celestial bodies.

30
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,130
As you
can see on the map in green, you have all

31
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,660
the ones that have signed this treaty;
all the spacefaring nations on one hand

32
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:17,170
and nearly all nations in the world
107 countries totally, excluding some

33
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:23,500
countries in Africa and in Latin America,
some in the Middle East and Southeast

34
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,030
Asia as well.

35
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:31,390
I will not address each of
the articles in this Outer Space Treaty

36
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:34,250
but just mention some key points.

37
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,440
The
treaty in particular bars the state from

38
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:41,440
placing weapons of mass destruction in
orbit around the earth, installing them

39
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,760
on the moon or any other celestial body.

40
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,360
The idea is to use space exclusively for
peaceful purposes.

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,140
The Treaty however
does not prohibit the placement of

42
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:58,670
conventional weapons in orbit and we
could still have potentially destructive

43
00:02:58,670 --> 00:03:01,150
attack strategies.

44
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,880
This hasn't happened and
hopefully will not happen but this is

45
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,970
allowed through the Treaty.

46
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:08,540
And also
another important point is that

47
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:11,530
Space is accessible by all nations in
the world.

48
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:15,200
No country can be prevented
from having access to space; Whether it's

49
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:21,140
for practical utilization or exploration.

50
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:27,260
Another important subject is that pretty
much like for Antarctica, there can be no

51
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:31,350
national appropriation by claim of
sovereignty on any part of a celestial

52
00:03:31,350 --> 00:03:33,600
body.

53
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,990
Let's talk about the space debris.

54
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:39,560
The space debris is obviously a pretty big
problem mainly in low Earth orbits.

55
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,120
Low
Earth orbit being between two hundred

56
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,850
kilometers above the Earth's surface all
the way to two thousand kilometers.

57
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:49,700
It's
also a problem around the geostationary orbit,

58
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:54,210
36,000 kilometers above
the Earth's surface and around that area.

59
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,280
Now the space debris population and
density is increasing with time and

60
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:03,430
something has to be done in order to
mitigate this space debris problem and

61
00:04:03,430 --> 00:04:08,980
reduce the density of debris and the
critical areas of space.

62
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:11,840
It's interesting
to see that article 9 of the Treaty

63
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:19,200
addresses the legal base for debris
mitigation and for so-called ADR (Active Debris

64
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,210
Removal).

65
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:27,620
The idea is for nations to conduct space exploration
so as to avoid harmful contamination

66
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:32,030
and also adverse changes in the
environment of the earth resulting from

67
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:37,130
the introduction of a matter and where
necessary these nation shall adopt

68
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:41,650
appropriate measures for this purpose.

69
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:45,191
One important measure that has been put
in place for mitigation of the space

70
00:04:45,191 --> 00:04:50,880
debris problem is that 25-year post
operational life limit.

71
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:54,980
Which means if a
satellite has a lifetime of let's say 10

72
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:59,230
years, and after that it becomes a space
debris because no longer operational.

73
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:03,270
Then 25 years after the end of this
operational time, it has to be de-orbited

74
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:06,750
by some means.

75
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:10,280
Several institutions and
companies are pursuing Active Debris Removal

76
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,070
technique development.

77
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:17,100
The moon Treaty of
1979 has not been as successful as the

78
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:19,810
Outer Space Treaty.

79
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,310
it specifically
addresses the situation of the moon and

80
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:27,660
other celestial bodies in the solar
system or even beyond.

81
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,720
The idea being that
have to they have to be used exclusively

82
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:36,400
for peaceful purposes pretty much in
line with the Outer Space Treaty.

83
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,430
One
controversial point in the Moon Treaty -

84
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,620
and that the reason why it hasn't been
signed by a number of nations - is that it

85
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:46,680
stipulated the moon and its natural
resources are the common heritage of

86
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:52,389
mankind and the harvesting of those
resources is forbidden except through an

87
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,800
international regime.

88
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,360
This obviously was
not to the taste of a number of nations

89
00:05:56,360 --> 00:06:02,930
and in particular the states that are
engaged in space exploration; at least

90
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:07,240
most of them, United States, Canada, nearly
all the members of the European Space

91
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:12,500
Agency, Russia, China and Japan have not
signed it.

92
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:16,920
Now obviously in the near
future, we'll have exploration the solar

93
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:22,820
system by human spacecraft and Space
lawyers are working on the subject to

94
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:28,130
provide a legal frame for future moon
mass and asteroid human missions in the

95
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,260
next decade including by private
companies like SpaceX.
