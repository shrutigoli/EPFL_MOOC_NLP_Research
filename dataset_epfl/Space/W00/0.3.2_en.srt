00:00:04,868 --> 00:00:07,108
Objectives of this course.

1
00:00:07,108 --> 00:00:09,913
First of all, this course may help you decide

2
00:00:09,913 --> 00:00:12,031
if you want to become an aerospace engineer,

3
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:14,014
or an engineer in another discipline,

4
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:16,967
but at least with some knowledge of the challenge

5
00:00:16,967 --> 00:00:21,044
of the design and execution of space missions,

6
00:00:21,044 --> 00:00:24,431
kind of a catch-all background for any engineer,

7
00:00:25,151 --> 00:00:28,172
or maybe become an astronaut, who knows?

8
00:00:28,172 --> 00:00:32,252
But being an astronaut may be dangerous. Let's have a look.

9
00:00:37,062 --> 00:00:39,040
(door slamming)

10
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,278
<i>(audience laughing)</i>

11
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:47,098
<i>(audience laughing)</i>

12
00:00:50,936 --> 00:00:55,832
This course is really an introductory course in aerospace engineering

13
00:00:55,832 --> 00:00:58,968
and in the design of the space missions.

14
00:00:58,968 --> 00:01:02,410
The emphasis will really be on concepts.

15
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:05,943
I want you to be able, at the end of this course,

16
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:10,415
to have a pretty clear idea of what a geosynchronous orbit is,

17
00:01:10,415 --> 00:01:13,438
geostationary orbit, sun synchronous orbit,

18
00:01:13,438 --> 00:01:17,020
what is a sidereal day compared to the mean solar day?

19
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,987
So I want you to have a clear idea about a number of concepts,

20
00:01:20,987 --> 00:01:24,218
and there will be a list of the concepts that will be provided

21
00:01:24,218 --> 00:01:28,870
so that before the end of the course, you can have a review of this list,

22
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,281
that you can see whether you really understand all these concepts.

23
00:01:32,281 --> 00:01:36,028
I want, out of this list, no concept where you cannot say anything,

24
00:01:36,028 --> 00:01:38,086
like, "I don't know what this is about."

25
00:01:38,086 --> 00:01:41,116
The list of the concepts is a very important part of the course.

26
00:01:41,676 --> 00:01:46,554
Trajectories. So this is not a course on spacecraft design,

27
00:01:46,554 --> 00:01:48,307
but on space <i>missions</i> design,

28
00:01:48,307 --> 00:01:50,773
and we'll be looking especially at trajectories,

29
00:01:50,773 --> 00:01:53,990
whether it's trajectories to gain access to the low Earth orbit,

30
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,783
or to an intermediate orbit, medium Earth orbit,

31
00:01:56,783 --> 00:01:58,927
or to the geostationary orbits.

32
00:01:58,927 --> 00:02:01,951
A lot of satellites go there and we will look at the strategies

33
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:05,499
to be efficient, to reach the geosynchronous orbit.

34
00:02:06,529 --> 00:02:09,117
We'll look also at energy considerations.

35
00:02:09,117 --> 00:02:13,808
We'll try to design the most energy efficient mission

36
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:18,025
to go towards Mars, or Jupiter, or Saturn, or any planet in the solar system.

37
00:02:19,285 --> 00:02:22,833
So these are the important things. Concepts--that's very important.

38
00:02:22,833 --> 00:02:25,248
Trajectories and energy management

39
00:02:25,256 --> 00:02:28,994
in low Earth orbit missions or beyond low Earth orbit.

40
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:33,277
Now, another aspect of the course will be the following.

41
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:35,633
I had the privilege of going into space myself

42
00:02:35,633 --> 00:02:38,143
on four occasions in the 90s, with the Space Shuttle.

43
00:02:38,143 --> 00:02:41,287
Spent a total of 43 days in space,

44
00:02:41,287 --> 00:02:45,227
and I had the huge privilege of being able to be involved

45
00:02:45,227 --> 00:02:47,591
in two Hubble space telescope servicing missions,

46
00:02:47,591 --> 00:02:50,945
mainly the first one, in December 1993,

47
00:02:50,945 --> 00:02:55,030
when we had to install an optical corrector for the telescope,

48
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:56,569
exchange the solar arrays,

49
00:02:56,569 --> 00:03:01,616
and do some other instrumentation or equipment exchange,

50
00:03:01,616 --> 00:03:04,691
and I will share with you the experience of having been in space,

51
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:06,288
because it's a very special occasion.

52
00:03:06,288 --> 00:03:09,803
Only about 550 people had the privilege of going to space.

53
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:12,786
I'm one of them, very privileged, and I will share this,

54
00:03:12,786 --> 00:03:15,334
so on several occasions during the course,

55
00:03:15,334 --> 00:03:17,841
I will rely on my own experience

56
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:21,082
and tell you how it is to be up there, and to work there.

57
00:03:21,842 --> 00:03:25,528
The views, the impressions, I will share this with you,

58
00:03:25,528 --> 00:03:27,960
but I really want to bring space to you,

59
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:30,175
not only the subject of the course itself,

60
00:03:30,175 --> 00:03:33,565
but sharing my experience and to help you in your space project.
