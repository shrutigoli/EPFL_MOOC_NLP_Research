1
00:00:05,537 --> 00:00:09,595
Let's talk about the pioneers 
in astronomy and celestial mechanics.

2
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:16,940
In fact, three centuries or more 
before the beginning of space exploration,

3
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,628
in the 1950s,

4
00:00:19,628 --> 00:00:24,271
we had some bright mathematicians
and physicians and astronomers

5
00:00:24,271 --> 00:00:30,149
who found the laws that govern
the motion of natural celestial bodies

6
00:00:30,149 --> 00:00:33,303
like planets or satellites around planets,

7
00:00:33,303 --> 00:00:38,199
but also the motion 
of artificial satellites or spacecraft.

8
00:00:40,201 --> 00:00:42,969
One of the pioneers is Tycho Brahe.

9
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:48,422
Tycho Brahe was Danish,
and at the end of the 16th century

10
00:00:48,422 --> 00:00:51,650
he made very precise observations
of the motion of planets,

11
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,250
especially the planet Mars.

12
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,761
And he was using no telescope,
but it was simple instrumentation,

13
00:00:56,761 --> 00:00:59,186
but very precise, 
and he was extremely careful

14
00:00:59,186 --> 00:01:03,199
to write down the result 
of all his observations.

15
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,987
Johannes Kepler, a little later,
he was from Germany,

16
00:01:07,987 --> 00:01:10,858
and he used the data 
that had been gathered by Tycho Brahe,

17
00:01:10,858 --> 00:01:12,902
mainly on the orbit of Mars,

18
00:01:12,902 --> 00:01:17,654
to determine, and this was extremely 
bright and challenging at that time,

19
00:01:17,654 --> 00:01:23,323
to determine the basic laws governing
the motion of planets around the Sun.

20
00:01:23,639 --> 00:01:25,839
The famous three laws of Kepler,

21
00:01:25,839 --> 00:01:28,493
the first one being related 
to the shape of the orbit,

22
00:01:28,493 --> 00:01:30,805
which is elliptical or circular,

23
00:01:30,805 --> 00:01:34,212
the second law relating 
the velocity on the orbit

24
00:01:34,212 --> 00:01:38,211
to the distance on elliptical orbit
around the Sun.

25
00:01:38,718 --> 00:01:42,129
We'll look at the detail 
of all these laws later,

26
00:01:42,129 --> 00:01:45,551
but the last one relates
the period of revolution

27
00:01:45,551 --> 00:01:48,986
of one planet around the Sun 
to the size of the orbit.

28
00:01:48,986 --> 00:01:51,930
So it was a remarkable achievement
at that time,

29
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:54,499
on the basis of the data
gathered by Tycho Brahe,

30
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:57,470
to determine these laws
by Johannes Kepler.

31
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:00,590
Now these are the two giants

32
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,823
of the pioneering of astronomy
and celestial mechanics.

33
00:02:04,823 --> 00:02:07,564
We have Galileo Galilei from Italy.

34
00:02:08,734 --> 00:02:14,872
On the one hand, he designed and utilized
the first refracting telescope

35
00:02:14,872 --> 00:02:18,032
using lenses and not mirrors,

36
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:20,539
and he did observations 
of the planet Venus

37
00:02:20,539 --> 00:02:23,054
and he saw that 
the planet Venus had phases.

38
00:02:23,054 --> 00:02:25,408
He also observed the satellite of Jupiter,

39
00:02:25,408 --> 00:02:28,068
and obviously all of these observations

40
00:02:28,068 --> 00:02:32,213
were in favor of heliocentrism
versus geocentrism,

41
00:02:32,213 --> 00:02:34,331
which was the theory of Ptolemy

42
00:02:34,331 --> 00:02:38,881
before the Copernican system
came into the game.

43
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:44,047
He also determined 
the law of falling motions;

44
00:02:44,047 --> 00:02:49,558
he did an experiment, it is said,
from the tower of Pisa in Italy,

45
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:54,579
and he determined that the time it takes
for two objects to fall

46
00:02:54,579 --> 00:02:57,052
from one given height
all the way to the ground

47
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:00,171
was independent
of the mass of the objects.

48
00:03:00,171 --> 00:03:02,552
He did not really have 
a theory about this,

49
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:05,013
this was taken up later by Newton himself,

50
00:03:05,013 --> 00:03:08,384
and it was completely compatible 
with the laws of motion by Newton.

51
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:10,210
But he made this observation.

52
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:16,000
By the way, this observation was made
again on the Apollo 15 mission,

53
00:03:16,229 --> 00:03:21,101
where David Scott dropped 
at the same time a feather and a hammer.

54
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,821
Obviously two very different masses.

55
00:03:23,821 --> 00:03:26,720
He was using the fact that 
in the absence of atmosphere

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,613
he could have a very clear determination

57
00:03:29,613 --> 00:03:32,411
of the falling time 
for objects of different masses,

58
00:03:32,411 --> 00:03:35,412
independently of 
the dragging atmosphere,

59
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:38,233
which is the case if you do the experiment
on the Earth.

60
00:03:38,233 --> 00:03:40,853
And when he released the two,
the hammer and the feather

61
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:43,812
came to the surface of the moon
at exactly the same time.

62
00:03:43,812 --> 00:03:46,240
So this is a proof that Galileo was right.

63
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,201
Now, Newton of course 
is a real bright star

64
00:03:52,293 --> 00:03:56,455
in the determination 
of the laws of physics and mechanics.

65
00:03:56,455 --> 00:03:59,943
On the one hand, he invented
another form of telescope

66
00:03:59,943 --> 00:04:01,975
compared to Galileo's.

67
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:05,921
He had a so-called reflecting telescope,
the Newtonian telescope.

68
00:04:05,921 --> 00:04:11,523
This is an optical configuration 
which is very much used today,

69
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:14,464
much more than refracting telescopes.

70
00:04:14,464 --> 00:04:16,765
And he determined the laws of motion,

71
00:04:16,765 --> 00:04:20,152
the first law, the second law, 
the third law of motion,

72
00:04:20,152 --> 00:04:22,985
which are fundamental laws of mechanics.

73
00:04:22,985 --> 00:04:26,933
And in fact, the motion of the planets
around the Sun,

74
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:32,238
the satellites around planets, 
and spacecrafts, manned or unmanned,

75
00:04:32,238 --> 00:04:36,569
can be completely explained and determined
on the basis of the laws of Newton.

76
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:39,570
We don't need to use the variations

77
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:43,460
of Newton's laws which Einstein brought:
the relativity.

78
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:47,162
Whenever you have very high speed,
close to the speed of light,

79
00:04:47,162 --> 00:04:50,312
or when you are in the vicinity
of extremely large masses

80
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:52,214
with high gravitational field,

81
00:04:52,214 --> 00:04:55,082
as it is the case in the vicinity of
a black hole for instance,

82
00:04:55,082 --> 00:04:56,875
then you have to use relativity.

83
00:04:56,875 --> 00:05:01,180
But on our course we are going 
to be following the laws of Newton,

84
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:07,553
and that is enough to explain 
celestial mechanics for spacecraft

85
00:05:07,553 --> 00:05:11,504
around the Earth and the Solar System
which will be covered in this course.

86
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,808
He also determined the law of gravitation,

87
00:05:14,808 --> 00:05:16,969
the force of gravitation 
between two masses

88
00:05:16,969 --> 00:05:19,587
being proportional 
to the masses themselves,

89
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:22,806
and also inversely proportional
to the square of the distance

90
00:05:22,806 --> 00:05:24,429
between these two bodies.

91
00:05:24,429 --> 00:05:27,006
This is a very fundamental law
discovered by Newton.

92
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:31,731
Now, beyond the pioneers 
of celestial mechanics and physics,

93
00:05:31,732 --> 00:05:36,862
the pioneers of the 16th, 17th,
beginning of the 18th century for Newton,

94
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:40,701
we had a few centuries, 
quite a number of years

95
00:05:40,701 --> 00:05:44,217
until we had the real rocket scientists,
the people who thought

96
00:05:44,217 --> 00:05:47,870
about ways to expel mass

97
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,870
produced by burning propellant,
for instance,

98
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:54,986
or by some other means,
at the end of an object,

99
00:05:54,986 --> 00:06:00,027
creating a force that will allow
the object to be propelled

100
00:06:00,027 --> 00:06:03,293
outside of the Earth's atmosphere
and go into space.

101
00:06:03,293 --> 00:06:08,946
The real pioneer in rocketry
is the Russian, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky.

102
00:06:10,841 --> 00:06:15,993
He studied all the theoretical aspects
of propulsion using rockets,

103
00:06:15,993 --> 00:06:20,163
and there is a famous equation 
named after Tsiolkovsky,

104
00:06:20,163 --> 00:06:22,559
the Rocket Equation, 
or Tsiolkovsky Equation,

105
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:26,363
which relates the increase in velocity
of an object in space

106
00:06:26,363 --> 00:06:30,352
versus the propellant 
that has been used for a given time

107
00:06:30,593 --> 00:06:33,271
in order to produce this motion in space.

108
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:38,400
We will cover Tsiolkovsky's Equation
in detail later in the course.

109
00:06:39,221 --> 00:06:42,900
Robert Goddard, an American,
did a lot of experiments

110
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,861
with a liquid-fuel rocket.

111
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:49,843
Of course, solid-fuel rockets
had been used,

112
00:06:50,523 --> 00:06:53,698
fireworks had been used in the past.

113
00:06:53,698 --> 00:06:56,522
Fireworks are solid-fuel rockets.

114
00:06:56,522 --> 00:06:58,232
These had been used by the Chinese

115
00:06:58,232 --> 00:07:00,730
and also other nations, quite a while ago,

116
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:04,934
but Robert Goddard developed the theory,
and also the practice,

117
00:07:04,934 --> 00:07:08,072
of a liquid-fuel rocket,
which are obviously used a lot today.

118
00:07:08,072 --> 00:07:10,690
Although solid-rocket boosters
are sometimes used

119
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:13,352
for the early ascent into space.

120
00:07:13,352 --> 00:07:15,474
This was the case for the Space Shuttle,

121
00:07:15,474 --> 00:07:18,215
it was also the case for Arianne,
and many other rockets.

122
00:07:18,215 --> 00:07:20,119
So now we very often have a combination

123
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:22,689
of solid propellant for rockets
and liquid propellant,

124
00:07:22,689 --> 00:07:26,598
but development of liquid rockets 
was made by Robert Goddard, an American.

125
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:32,371
Hermann Oberth was a German engineer
and a rocket scientist,

126
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:38,074
who had the vision 
of using rockets for space travel.

127
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:42,430
He wrote a fascinating book in German,

128
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,430
<i>Die Rackete zu den Planetenräumen</i>,

129
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,415
which means <i>The Rockets 
into Interplanetary Space</i>.

130
00:07:48,415 --> 00:07:51,401
This was in the 1930s, 
and it was very advanced at that time

131
00:07:51,401 --> 00:07:53,194
where of course people were thinking

132
00:07:53,194 --> 00:07:55,724
more of using rockets 
for military purposes,

133
00:07:55,724 --> 00:07:59,360
but he was a visionary 
thinking of space travel,

134
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,635
much before it started in the 1950s.

135
00:08:03,635 --> 00:08:08,703
Wernher von Braun
worked during the Second World War

136
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:11,584
in Germany, 
a German rocket scientist,

137
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:15,803
and he developed the V-2 rocket
at the end of the last world war.

138
00:08:15,803 --> 00:08:19,322
But he was picked at the end of the war

139
00:08:19,322 --> 00:08:22,322
by the Americans, and brought to the US.

140
00:08:22,322 --> 00:08:26,602
He was initially a German citizen,
but became also an American citizen.

141
00:08:26,602 --> 00:08:30,639
He helped a lot to develop 
the US space program,

142
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:32,789
all the way to the Apollo program.

143
00:08:32,789 --> 00:08:35,840
He is considered to be the father
of the Saturn V rocket,

144
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,333
which is a big rocket used 
in the Apollo program,

145
00:08:38,333 --> 00:08:41,622
to take people and some equipment
to the Moon.
