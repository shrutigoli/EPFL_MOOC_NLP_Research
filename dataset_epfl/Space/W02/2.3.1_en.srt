1
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:09,279
Today we'll look at orbital motion
and Kepler's laws,

2
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:14,191
which are fundamental laws
related to the two-body problem

3
00:00:14,191 --> 00:00:18,436
and the motion typically
of a satellite around the Earth,

4
00:00:18,436 --> 00:00:22,658
or the motion of a planet
around the Sun.

5
00:00:23,502 --> 00:00:26,633
Now, basically the two-body problem
is to determine the motion

6
00:00:26,633 --> 00:00:29,439
of the two bodies
that interact with each other.

7
00:00:30,087 --> 00:00:32,872
We have some examples,
like double stars,

8
00:00:32,872 --> 00:00:36,681
where the two masses, the stars,
are relatively comparable.

9
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:39,687
We will not consider that;
we'll only consider the case

10
00:00:39,687 --> 00:00:44,146
of a very small low-mass object
around a massive object,

11
00:00:44,146 --> 00:00:47,874
typically a satellite around the Earth,
or planets around the Sun.

12
00:00:49,161 --> 00:00:50,236
Now we have the expression

13
00:00:50,236 --> 00:00:52,454
of the gravitational force,
or Newton's law.

14
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:54,433
We have seen this a few times.

15
00:00:55,186 --> 00:00:59,077
The gravitational force
per unit mass is equal to <i>μ / r²</i>,

16
00:00:59,077 --> 00:01:03,126
μ equal to the gravitational
constant <i>G</i>

17
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:05,434
times the mass of the central body.

18
00:01:05,665 --> 00:01:08,704
Now, the hypotheses that we have
for the rest of the course will be that,

19
00:01:08,704 --> 00:01:13,266
unless otherwise noted,
we'll consider that we only have

20
00:01:13,266 --> 00:01:16,694
the central body plus the spacecraft.

21
00:01:17,061 --> 00:01:19,267
The mass of the spacecraft
is much smaller

22
00:01:19,267 --> 00:01:20,741
than the mass of the central body,

23
00:01:20,741 --> 00:01:23,709
so that the center of mass
of the two objects,

24
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,297
in the two-body problem,

25
00:01:25,297 --> 00:01:27,651
will be at the center
of the most massive body,

26
00:01:27,651 --> 00:01:29,738
typically the Earth or the Sun.

27
00:01:30,191 --> 00:01:33,342
We consider that the bodies
are spherical and homogeneous,

28
00:01:33,342 --> 00:01:34,942
and no perturbations.

29
00:01:35,288 --> 00:01:39,393
By the way, of perturbations,
we have some values here

30
00:01:39,393 --> 00:01:45,617
which are valid for a spacecraft
on orbit around the Earth.

31
00:01:46,281 --> 00:01:50,043
If we are on Low Earth Orbit,
the gravitational acceleration

32
00:01:50,043 --> 00:01:53,786
is typically of the order of 0.9
of the gravitational acceleration

33
00:01:53,786 --> 00:01:56,685
at the surface of the Earth,
but if we look at the value

34
00:01:56,685 --> 00:02:01,699
of the perturbation
due to the Sun, <i>6 x 10^-4</i>,

35
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:04,531
it's not completely negligible,
but it still is small,

36
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:07,304
and if we look
at the influence of the Moon,

37
00:02:07,304 --> 00:02:09,601
Jupiter, and Venus
are very, very small values.

38
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:12,594
So the major perturbation,
apart of course from the drag

39
00:02:12,594 --> 00:02:14,763
due to the residual atmosphere

40
00:02:14,763 --> 00:02:18,077
at the altitude of
a Low Earth Orbit spacecraft,

41
00:02:18,716 --> 00:02:21,204
the major perturbation is due to the Sun.

42
00:02:22,128 --> 00:02:25,917
Kepler's laws were established
at the beginning of the 17th century

43
00:02:25,917 --> 00:02:28,839
by Kepler doing very careful observation

44
00:02:28,839 --> 00:02:32,265
of the motion of mass in the sky.

45
00:02:33,439 --> 00:02:38,471
It was very remarkable to come
to these three fundamental laws

46
00:02:38,471 --> 00:02:41,977
just on the basis
of these visual observations

47
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:43,219
with some instruments,

48
00:02:43,219 --> 00:02:46,201
but they were relatively
primitive instruments,

49
00:02:46,201 --> 00:02:49,029
so quite an achievement by Kepler

50
00:02:49,029 --> 00:02:51,126
in the establishment of these three laws.

51
00:02:51,463 --> 00:02:54,146
The first law is that
the orbit of every planet

52
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:55,753
is an ellipse with the Sun

53
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:58,441
at one of the two foci of the ellipse,

54
00:02:58,441 --> 00:03:00,517
and we have three examples here.

55
00:03:01,193 --> 00:03:05,563
We have the inner ellipse,
in the white color,

56
00:03:05,563 --> 00:03:09,231
with a relatively large eccentricity,
so it's a stretched ellipse.

57
00:03:09,231 --> 00:03:11,866
We have the blue ellipse,
a little bit larger,

58
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:16,037
always with the Sun
at one of the focus of the ellipse,

59
00:03:17,147 --> 00:03:19,356
with a little less eccentricity
than the first one,

60
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:24,522
and the outer orbit
is nearly a circular orbit.

61
00:03:24,522 --> 00:03:28,823
So these are three examples
of closed orbits:

62
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,326
either ellipse with large
or small eccentricity, or circle.

63
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,482
This is what Kepler established.

64
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:39,552
Now we have a generalization
of the first law of Kepler,

65
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:43,500
where the orbit, in the case
of a two-body problem,

66
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,667
the orbit of the small body
versus the large body,

67
00:03:47,667 --> 00:03:50,322
is, generally speaking, a conic.

68
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:53,739
It's either an ellipse,
with a special case of a circle,

69
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:56,356
or a parabola or hyperbola.

70
00:03:56,356 --> 00:03:59,354
So this is a generalization
of the first law of Kepler:

71
00:03:59,354 --> 00:04:03,698
conic orbits around the Sun,
or around every massive object.

72
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:06,214
Kepler's second law is a fundamental law.

73
00:04:06,214 --> 00:04:09,588
It says that a line
joining a planet and the Sun

74
00:04:09,588 --> 00:04:13,395
sweeps out equal areas
during equal intervals of time.

75
00:04:14,003 --> 00:04:17,922
If you consider what's happening
close to the perihelion,

76
00:04:17,922 --> 00:04:21,170
we have the radius of vector <i>S</i> to <i>a</i>,

77
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:24,394
and we have the elliptical motion,

78
00:04:24,394 --> 00:04:27,343
which is covered counterclockwise,

79
00:04:27,343 --> 00:04:32,453
so we go from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>,
and if we consider the surface of <i>S, a, b</i>,

80
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:35,072
it has a certain value,

81
00:04:35,072 --> 00:04:38,091
then we go further away
towards the aphelion,

82
00:04:38,091 --> 00:04:40,341
and we go from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>,

83
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:42,220
further away from the Sun.

84
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,958
And if we have
these two areas being equal

85
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:48,540
then the time from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>
is going to be equal

86
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,074
to the time from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>,

87
00:04:50,074 --> 00:04:52,206
which means that close to the perihelion

88
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:54,723
we have a much higher orbital velocity

89
00:04:54,723 --> 00:04:56,864
than if we move away from the perihelion,

90
00:04:56,864 --> 00:04:59,820
and we have the minimum velocity
when we are at a aphelion.

91
00:04:59,894 --> 00:05:03,385
The third law of Kepler
is expressing the relationship

92
00:05:03,385 --> 00:05:06,597
between the time of revolution
of a planet around the Sun

93
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,181
or of a satellite around the Earth

94
00:05:09,181 --> 00:05:14,224
as a function of the semi-major axis
of the elliptical orbit.

95
00:05:14,855 --> 00:05:17,598
Basically, we have the square
of the time of revolution

96
00:05:17,598 --> 00:05:19,179
is proportional to the cube

97
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:24,775
of the semi-major axis of the ellipse,

98
00:05:24,775 --> 00:05:26,986
which is the trajectory of that planet,

99
00:05:26,986 --> 00:05:29,257
or that space wrapped around
the central body.

100
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:32,635
This is an animation summarizing
the three laws of Kepler,

101
00:05:32,635 --> 00:05:35,407
at least the original version
of the three laws of Kepler,

102
00:05:35,407 --> 00:05:38,002
with a closed orbit around the Sun.

103
00:05:38,002 --> 00:05:41,401
We have two elliptical orbits,
and we have one large circular obit.

104
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,841
So the first law of Kepler
is illustrated here

105
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:48,016
with the shape of these orbits,
elliptical or circular,

106
00:05:48,016 --> 00:05:53,323
and of course in the general case
we have any conic trajectory.

107
00:05:53,323 --> 00:05:54,806
Typically, we can have

108
00:05:54,806 --> 00:05:57,152
a parabolic trajectory
or hyperbolic trajectory,

109
00:05:57,152 --> 00:05:58,838
and we'll have this hyperbolic trajectory

110
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:02,189
when we cover the case
of interplanetary trajectories.

111
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:03,965
Within the sphere
of influence of the Earth

112
00:06:03,965 --> 00:06:07,585
or the destination planet,
we'll have hyperbolic orbits.

113
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:10,921
For the second law, we see clearly,

114
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:15,434
especially for the small
white elliptical orbit,

115
00:06:15,434 --> 00:06:17,362
that the velocity of the planet

116
00:06:17,362 --> 00:06:20,273
is much larger when it's close to the Sun.

117
00:06:20,273 --> 00:06:23,236
Of course, we have no orbit
in the solar system

118
00:06:23,236 --> 00:06:27,105
with so much eccentricity,
but this is to illustrate the second law,

119
00:06:27,105 --> 00:06:30,755
which is a version of the conservation
of angular momentum.

120
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:32,870
For the circular orbit, a large orbit,

121
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:34,677
of course the velocity is constant,

122
00:06:34,677 --> 00:06:38,357
equal to the square root of <i>μ / r</i>,

123
00:06:38,357 --> 00:06:40,447
<i>r</i> being the distance to the Sun.

124
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:45,242
Now, for the third law
we cannot see the numerical value

125
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:49,374
of a <i>T²</i> proportional to <i>a³</i>,
but we see that, obviously,

126
00:06:49,374 --> 00:06:52,283
for large orbits,
the time of revolution of the planet

127
00:06:52,283 --> 00:06:55,061
around the sun is much larger
than for small orbits.
