Here we have a set of useful formulas, or relationships, valid for elliptical orbits, two slides, this one and the next one.
And these are expressions that you can use in the future to do calculations related to elliptical orbits.
On this slide, I would like to point out in particular mean motion.
It's an important parameter, it's in radians per second.
It's the average rate of evolution of the radians on the elliptical orbit, equal to square root of <i>Î¼</i> over <i>a</i> cube.
In fact, the period of the elliptical motion is equal to <i>2 Ï€</i> radians divided by the mean motion.
So <i>2 Ï€ times square root of a cube over Î¼</i>, so the relationship between <i>T</i> and <i>n</i> is clearly expressed here also.
All the other expressions you can use, again, relationship between the eccentricity, the semi-major axis, the distance to the apogee and perigee, again, useful expressions to be used in the future.
Here is another set of expressions that will be used in the future.
Now, there is one, the time since periapsis, that we'll be talking about later, it's the so-called  Kepler's equation.
It's a relationship between <i>E</i>, which is the so-called eccentric anomaly, which is related to the true anomaly in this way.
And we'll have the definition of the eccentric anomaly in the following slide.
But this is going to be a very important expression to see the time evolution of the true anomaly, <i>Î¸</i> versus <i>T</i>, and we have to go via the eccentric anomaly, which will be defined later.
Obviously, we have this very important expression that we developed earlier, the velocity in an elliptical orbit,
<i>square root of 2 Î¼ over r minus Î¼ over a</i> and the expression of the conservation of the angular momentum, on the perigee you have the largest speed:
<i>r_p</i> is small, and <i>V_p</i> is large and is equal to the products of the distance to the apogee and the velocity at the apogee.
This is of course an expression of the second law of Kepler.
Now, this is one example of an utilization of the expression that we developed on the previous slide.
You have, for instance, the determination of <i>r</i>, the radius vector from the central body to the spacecraft knowing the semi-major axis, the eccentricity, and the value of the true anomaly <i>Î¸</i>, or knowing the distance to the perigee <i>r_p</i>, the eccentricity, and the value of <i>Î¸</i>.
So you see the expression here and, again, you can derive such expression from the preceding slides, where we have all these relationships valid for elliptical orbits.
Another example, and it's an interesting example where you can determine all the parameters of an elliptical orbit knowing two points of the orbit.
So you have <i>r_1</i>, that's one point over there with <i>Î¸_1</i> and <i>r_1</i>, and here is another point, where you have <i>Î¸_2</i>, another true anomaly and the value of <i>r_2</i>.
And if you know these two points, you can, with this expression that we had here, determine the parameters of the orbit and, again, and it's the eccentricity, and the distance to the perigee or the apogee, or the semi-major axis, and all these values can be determined using preceding expressions.
Keplerâ€™s equation, this is, again, a major achievement of Kepler in the 17th century.
All of the relationships that we have seen so far, are geometrical relationships relating all the parameters of the orbit, but we have not had a time sequence of how the value of <i>r</i>, the radius vector amplitude, or <i>Î¸</i>, the true anomaly, evolve with time.
Kepler on the basis, again, of his very precise observations of the motion of the planet Mars in the 17th century determined this time evolution:
<i>E</i>, which is eccentric anomaly, and we had the definition of the eccentric anomaly here.
This is the angle between the line of the apsides and this line here, this segment, which is between the center of the ellipse and the intersection with the circle having the line of apsides as a diameter.
You have this point here which is the intersection of the perpendicular to the line of apsides going through the spacecraft or the planet.
So this is the definition of <i>E</i>, and obviously, there is a relationship between <i>E</i> and the true anomaly.
We have seen this in the preceding slide.
So Kepler's equation, which is a transcendental equation you cannot solve it for <i>E</i>, you cannot have an algebraic expression of <i>E</i> versus <i>t</i>.
But it expresses the time evolution of E, the eccentric anomaly, so you have also the time evolution of Î¸, the true anomaly, and you can use other relationships to have also the time evolution of <i>r</i>, the length of the radius vector.
So you can solve the Kepler's equation and have the whole time evolution of the motion of the spacecraft or the planet on its orbit.
It has to be solved numerically, obviously, it cannot be solved algebraically.
It's a transcendental equation.
