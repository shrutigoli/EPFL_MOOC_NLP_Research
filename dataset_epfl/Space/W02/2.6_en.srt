00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:08,955
We hope that you enjoyed
this week with us.

2
00:00:08,955 --> 00:00:11,445
Thanks very much for your attendance.

3
00:00:12,025 --> 00:00:16,147
I'd like you to focus on the concepts
presented in these units.

4
00:00:16,147 --> 00:00:18,655
Once these concepts
are clearly understood,

5
00:00:18,655 --> 00:00:20,954
including their application,

6
00:00:20,954 --> 00:00:23,927
you can take the final test of the unit.

7
00:00:23,927 --> 00:00:26,040
We'd like to remind you, also,

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:31,476
about the focus on Rosetta,
with the interview of Andrea Accomazzo,

9
00:00:31,476 --> 00:00:34,252
Head of Solar and Planetary
Missions Division,

10
00:00:34,252 --> 00:00:37,015
and previously Rosetta Flight Director.
