This is a review of Newton's law of gravitation.
If you look at this picture, you have the Earth with a radius <i>R</i>, and we look at force of gravitation at a distance <i>r</i> from the center of the Earth, is <i>F vectorial r</i>, and the value of <i>F_r</i> is equal to - we designate the gravitational acceleration at that distance <i>r</i> from the center of the Earth as <i>g_r</i> - and the force is <i>g_r</i> times the mass of the object.
<i>g_r</i> is equal to <i>Î¼ / rÂ²</i>.
In the course we always use, or very often use <i>Î¼ = G M</i> , <i>G</i> the constant of gravitation,
<i>M</i> the mass of the central object here, the Earth.
Now, if we look at the situation at the distance <i>R</i> from the center of the Earth, on the surface of the Earth, then we have the force of gravitation equals <i>g_0 times m</i>.
The <i>g_0</i> is a gravitational acceleration on the surface of the Earth, and we very often use simply the term <i>g</i>.
<i>g</i> is equal to 9.81 m / secÂ².
The gravitational profile.
Inside the Earth and outside the Earth we are interested to see what gravitational acceleration, and what force we have on a unit mass inside the Earth.
We have to imagine a cavity at a certain distance <i>r</i> from the center of the Earth, and you wonder what would be the gravitational acceleration at this point on this cavity.
It just happens - and you can make the calculation yourself - that everything is so that only the part of the mass of the Earth considered a homogeneous object which is inside that cavity, or the total sphere that has a radius of <i>r</i>,
<i>r</i> being the distance between this cavity and the center of the Earth, that's the only part that has a gravitational effect on any object in this cavity.
The shell, which is outside between the radius <i>r</i>, distance to the center of the Earth of this cavity, and <i>R</i> which is the radius of the Earth, that shell has a null influence, gravitationally, on any object located in this cavity.
And as the mass of the portion of the Earth inside that cavity, that sphere inside the cavity is proportional to <i>rÂ³</i>, and then the gravitational acceleration is proportional to <i>R / rÂ²</i>, then <i>rÂ³ / rÂ²</i> gives you <i>r</i>.
So the gravitational acceleration inside such a cavity, inside the planet Earth, is going to be linear with the distance to the Earth.
It starts at zero, and is slowly increasing linearly to the value of 9.81 m/secÂ², which is the gravitational acceleration on the surface of the Earth.
Beyond that point, obviously, we have a decrease in <i>1 / rÂ²</i> all the way to infinity.
We have here the gravitational figures for bodies in the solar system.
If we look at the Earth, which is obviously of interest, we have the time to fall 4.9 m, this is one half of 9.81, is going to be 1 second for the Earth.
Obviously the gravity equal to 1.
This is gravity in terms of <i>g_0</i>
The escape velocity 11.2 km/s.
This is valid for the surface of the Earth.
Obviously, if you want to escape the gravitational effect of the Earth from a distance <i>r</i> from the center of the Earth which is larger than the radius of the Earth, this value will decrease.
In fact, the escape velocity is the square root of <i>2 Î¼ / r</i> so it varies as 1 divided by the square root of <i>r</i> as you go away from the surface of the Earth.
Now, the circular velocities on the surface of the Earth, which is of course not possible because of the atmosphere, but if you had no atmosphere you would have about 7.9 km/s, and this is square root of <i>Î¼ / r</i>.
The escape velocity is always equal to the square root of two times the circular velocity for a given distance to the center of the attracting object.
If we look at values for the Sun, for instance, obviously we have a very large escape velocity of 618 km/s.
We have quite a large value for Jupiter, also, 60 km/s, because the large mass of the planet Jupiter and the large acceleration on the surface, gravitational acceleration on the surface of planet Jupiter.
In the next section we'll look to more details of the concept of the gravitational well.
The gravitational well basically is a conceptual model of the gravitational field surrounding a body in space.
And what will be especially interesting, and we'll determine that in the next section, will be the depth of the gravitational well.
Entering space from the surface of a planet means climbing out of the gravity well, and the deeper a planet gravity well is, the more energy it takes to escape from it.
So we'll look at this in detail in the next section.
