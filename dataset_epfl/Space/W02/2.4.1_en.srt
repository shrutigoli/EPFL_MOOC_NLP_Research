1
00:00:05,559 --> 00:00:10,315
Today we'll cover the subject
of circular and elliptical orbits.

2
00:00:10,315 --> 00:00:14,726
Obviously, a fundamental subject
for what will follow in the course.

3
00:00:14,726 --> 00:00:19,715
Now we'll determine the circular velocity 
on a circular orbit

4
00:00:20,891 --> 00:00:23,727
and it's a simple expression:

5
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:27,044
The centrifugal force
on a circular orbit

6
00:00:27,044 --> 00:00:29,152
is equal to the gravitational force.

7
00:00:29,152 --> 00:00:30,779
So, generally speaking, we have

8
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:33,946
the inertial force equal
to the gravitational force.

9
00:00:34,868 --> 00:00:37,222
When you have the motion of a spacecraft

10
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:39,541
or a celestial body
in a gravitational field,

11
00:00:40,221 --> 00:00:43,140
so we have <i>(V²) / r</i>
which is the centrifugal force

12
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:46,887
equal to <i>µ / (r²)</i>,
this is per unit mass

13
00:00:47,357 --> 00:00:50,458
and we can derive the circular velocity

14
00:00:50,458 --> 00:00:52,396
and that's a fundamental relationship

15
00:00:52,396 --> 00:00:55,218
that we'll use very often,
the circular velocity

16
00:00:55,218 --> 00:00:58,881
<i>V</i> equal: <i>V_circ</i> =<i>√ (µ/ r)</i>

17
00:01:00,302 --> 00:01:03,156
Now we can, on the basis of this,

18
00:01:03,516 --> 00:01:08,169
we can immediately determine 
the expression for the third Keppler's law

19
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:12,305
the relationship between 
the period of the orbit

20
00:01:12,305 --> 00:01:16,904
and the radius of a circular orbit,
respectively the semi-major axis

21
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:20,617
and you can see this here

22
00:01:20,617 --> 00:01:25,267
the period equal <i>(2 π r)/V</i>

23
00:01:25,267 --> 00:01:26,821
It's the total path

24
00:01:26,821 --> 00:01:29,250
on the circular orbit divided by velocity.

25
00:01:30,161 --> 00:01:33,223
If you replace <i>V</i> by the expression
that we had before,

26
00:01:33,223 --> 00:01:38,097
<i>√(µ/r)</i> you find Keppler's
law for circular orbit;

27
00:01:38,097 --> 00:01:41,825
T=2π √(r³/µ)

28
00:01:42,339 --> 00:01:48,266
and this is valid also 
for an elliptical orbit,

29
00:01:48,266 --> 00:01:51,997
although it's somewhat more difficult
to determine that, to prove

30
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:54,203
and I will not do this here,

31
00:01:54,203 --> 00:01:58,433
but what we found for the circular orbit
is valid also for an elliptical orbit

32
00:01:58,433 --> 00:02:01,526
where you replace <i>r</i> by <i>a</i>.

33
00:02:01,526 --> 00:02:05,326
T=2π √(a³/µ)

34
00:02:05,329 --> 00:02:07,008
This is the third of Keppler's laws.

35
00:02:08,388 --> 00:02:12,210
Here we have an ellipse,
basically an elliptical orbit

36
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:15,762
and I will describe some of 
the fundamental parameters

37
00:02:15,762 --> 00:02:17,341
of an elliptical orbit.

38
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:23,972
First of all, let's talk about 
the periapsis and the apoapsis.

39
00:02:24,284 --> 00:02:26,296
This is the line of apsides,

40
00:02:26,296 --> 00:02:31,047
which is a line between the point
on the orbit closest to the focus,

41
00:02:31,047 --> 00:02:33,078
where the central body is,

42
00:02:33,078 --> 00:02:37,447
and the point on the orbit
the furthest away from the focus.

43
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:41,224
Periapsis and apoapsis are general terms.

44
00:02:41,224 --> 00:02:45,480
If we have the Earth as the central body,
we're talking about perigee, apogee;

45
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,975
if we have the Sun, it's going to be
perihelion and aphelion.

46
00:02:49,975 --> 00:02:53,908
But generally speaking, again,
periapsis and apoapsis.

47
00:02:53,908 --> 00:02:59,475
Now we have the distance <i>r</i>
from the center of the central body

48
00:02:59,475 --> 00:03:05,816
and the spacecraft or the planet
if the central body is the Sun.

49
00:03:06,206 --> 00:03:11,733
The velocity <i>V</i>, and <i>ϴ</i> is the so-called 
<i>True anomaly</i>.

50
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:14,703
This is an important term.

51
00:03:16,459 --> 00:03:19,590
The term itself seems strange,
but this is all historical.

52
00:03:20,212 --> 00:03:24,163
The <i>True anomaly</i> is the angle
between the direction of the periapsis

53
00:03:24,163 --> 00:03:29,533
from the central body to the radius vector
to the spacecraft or the planet.

54
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:32,480
Now, in terms of the ellipse itself,

55
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,320
obviously, we have the semi-major axis,

56
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,032
the distance between
the center of the ellipse

57
00:03:40,032 --> 00:03:42,403
and either the apoapsis and the periapsis.

58
00:03:43,053 --> 00:03:50,289
<i>c</i> is <i>a</i>, the semi major axis,
multiplied by the eccentricity

59
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:53,639
is the distance between the center
of the ellipse and the focus.

60
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:58,089
Obviously, if we have <i>c</i> = 0
we have a circular orbit.

61
00:03:58,089 --> 00:04:00,725
If <i>c</i> becomes larger and larger,

62
00:04:01,225 --> 00:04:05,622
it means that the eccentricity
is becoming closer and closer to 1

63
00:04:05,622 --> 00:04:11,369
and the limit case of eccentricity one
is the case of a parabolic orbit.

64
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:16,587
Now we have, from the central body,
the distance to the apoapsis

65
00:04:16,587 --> 00:04:20,928
<i>r_a</i> and the distance
to the periapsis, which is <i>r_p</i>

66
00:04:21,848 --> 00:04:25,571
<i>b</i> is the semi-minor axis.

67
00:04:26,371 --> 00:04:29,950
These are the parameters
that we'll consider in the future, again:

68
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,608
semi-major axis, semi-minor axis,
eccentricity < 1 for an ellipse

69
00:04:36,608 --> 00:04:38,282
and zero for a circle.

70
00:04:38,918 --> 00:04:43,107
<i>r_a</i> and <i>r_p</i>, the distance
to the apoapsis and periapsis;

71
00:04:43,107 --> 00:04:44,768
velocity, and the true anomaly.

72
00:04:44,768 --> 00:04:47,706
These are the important parameters
on an elliptical orbit.

73
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,498
Let's look at the energy

74
00:04:50,498 --> 00:04:52,868
of the orbital motion 
and orbital velocity.

75
00:04:52,964 --> 00:04:57,860
Now, a fundamental expression
is obviously the energy.

76
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,238
The total energy in a gravitational field
is going to be the sum

77
00:05:02,238 --> 00:05:04,367
of the kinetic energy
and the potential energy.

78
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,649
We have seen this before.

79
00:05:06,649 --> 00:05:10,960
Per unit mass: <i>V²/2 - µ/r</i>

80
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:18,140
What is interesting is that if you
replace the <i>V</i> by the escape velocity,

81
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:21,185
<i>√(2µ/r)</i>

82
00:05:21,185 --> 00:05:25,426
you find that the energy
of the orbital motion is zero

83
00:05:25,956 --> 00:05:30,345
so the limit case
of a very elongated ellipse,

84
00:05:30,345 --> 00:05:32,987
you get total energy close to zero.

85
00:05:32,987 --> 00:05:38,537
In the limit case of a parabolic orbit,
you have a total energy equal to zero.

86
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:41,884
Now, if you have a <i>V</i> < escape velocity,

87
00:05:41,884 --> 00:05:43,577
which is obviously the case
for a closed orbit,

88
00:05:43,577 --> 00:05:45,019
you have a negative energy.

89
00:05:45,019 --> 00:05:48,322
So, a circular orbit or elliptical orbit,

90
00:05:48,662 --> 00:05:53,475
even relatively large eccentricities,
always total negative energy.

91
00:05:54,282 --> 00:05:56,823
Energy total zero for a parabolic orbit,

92
00:05:56,823 --> 00:05:59,291
and we'll see later
if we have a hyperbolic orbit,

93
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,684
then you have a total energy
which is positive.

94
00:06:02,325 --> 00:06:03,823
Now, if you replace here the <i>V</i>

95
00:06:03,823 --> 00:06:08,602
by the circular velocity
on a circular orbit,

96
00:06:08,602 --> 00:06:11,371
V = √(µ/r)

97
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:18,351
you find that total energy <i>&#949;= -µ/(2r)</i>

98
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:22,606
and we can generalize this
with this value here,

99
00:06:22,846 --> 00:06:27,387
total energy
in an elliptical orbit = -µ/(2a)

100
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:29,975
which is interesting, because
it depends only on <i>a</i>

101
00:06:29,975 --> 00:06:31,970
and not at all on the eccentricity.

102
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:41,429
On the basis of this expression
of the conservation of energy

103
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:45,229
we can determine what is the value,
on an elliptical orbit,

104
00:06:45,229 --> 00:06:50,422
of the velocity as a function
of the distance to the central body

105
00:06:50,422 --> 00:06:54,565
and it's not a completely 
simple derivation

106
00:06:54,565 --> 00:07:00,940
but we come to the conclusion
that the velocity = √(2µ/r - µ/a)

107
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:05,379
This is a fundamental expression
that we'll use very often in the future.

108
00:07:05,565 --> 00:07:11,946
You can see with this expression
that if you replace <i>a</i> by <i>r</i>,

109
00:07:12,736 --> 00:07:14,867
which is the case of a circular orbit,

110
00:07:14,867 --> 00:07:19,370
then <i>V</i> you find again,
V = √(µ/r) for a circular orbit

111
00:07:20,623 --> 00:07:24,697
and again, this expression
of the velocity as a function of <i>r</i>

112
00:07:24,697 --> 00:07:27,186
on an elliptical orbit is fundamental.

113
00:07:27,186 --> 00:07:29,403
We'll use this quite often in the future.

114
00:07:31,115 --> 00:07:32,642
How about angular momentum?

115
00:07:32,642 --> 00:07:37,606
We have here the spacecraft
and here the central body

116
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:42,728
and the radius vector <i>r</i> between the center
of the central body and the spacecraft.

117
00:07:43,722 --> 00:07:47,544
You have the velocity vector,
which, in this drawing,

118
00:07:47,544 --> 00:07:50,640
is in a direction away

119
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:53,058
from the perpendicular
to the radius vector,

120
00:07:53,538 --> 00:07:58,355
and a very important parameter is gamma.

121
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,071
It's called the flight path angle.

122
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:03,907
It's the angle between
the direction of the velocity vector

123
00:08:03,907 --> 00:08:08,347
and the perpendicular to the radius vector
at the point where the spacecraft is.

124
00:08:09,222 --> 00:08:11,717
It's quite an important parameter,

125
00:08:11,717 --> 00:08:14,879
because in practice, for instance
with the Space Shuttle,

126
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:19,061
when we had so-called main engine cutoff
at the end of the powered ascent,

127
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:23,022
we had to have a slightly positive
flight path angle

128
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:27,179
which means that
when we had orbit insertion,

129
00:08:27,179 --> 00:08:31,030
we had to be on a trajectory
that was going to take us

130
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,989
to the apogee of our orbit,

131
00:08:32,989 --> 00:08:36,281
which was about 45 minutes
after main engine cutoff

132
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:39,531
and the altitude
of the apogee, by definition,

133
00:08:39,531 --> 00:08:43,486
was larger than the altitude at which
we had main engine cutoff

134
00:08:43,486 --> 00:08:46,973
and at the apogee, which was
way outside of the atmosphere,

135
00:08:46,973 --> 00:08:50,444
typically to the order
of 200 or 300 kliometers,

136
00:08:50,444 --> 00:08:53,408
we had to do a posi-grade burn

137
00:08:53,408 --> 00:08:57,153
or we had to accelerate in order
to circularize at that altitude.

138
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:59,941
If we had not done that,
we would have come back

139
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:01,761
to the altitude of the main engine cutoff

140
00:09:01,761 --> 00:09:05,346
which was in the very high atmosphere,
typically 120 kilometers.

141
00:09:05,931 --> 00:09:09,855
So the flight path angle, again,
a very important parameter

142
00:09:09,855 --> 00:09:13,905
and we'll talk very often about that
in the future of the course.

143
00:09:13,905 --> 00:09:16,143
Then you have the value
of the angular momentum, obviously,

144
00:09:16,143 --> 00:09:21,345
<i>j vector</i> = <i>r vector</i> cross product <i>V</i>

145
00:09:21,345 --> 00:09:24,413
and the amplitude
of the angular momentum

146
00:09:24,413 --> 00:09:28,789
is just <i>r</i> times <i>V</i> times the cosine
of the flight path angle.

147
00:09:29,599 --> 00:09:32,314
The variation of the flight path angle
on an elliptical orbit

148
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:34,566
is a function of the position.

149
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:42,019
If we start with the periapsis, obviously,
we have a flight path angle equal to zero.

150
00:09:43,697 --> 00:09:49,788
As we go on the elliptical orbit
towards the apogee,

151
00:09:49,788 --> 00:09:52,526
we are going to have <i>r</i>
increasing, obviously,

152
00:09:52,526 --> 00:09:54,736
the distance increasing, but also,

153
00:09:54,736 --> 00:09:58,317
the flight path angle
will go to positive values.

154
00:09:58,317 --> 00:10:03,239
Then when we get at the apogee,
it will be, again, zero.

155
00:10:03,239 --> 00:10:05,460
Then it will decrease, <i>r</i> will decrease

156
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:10,957
obviously as we go back 
towards the perigee

157
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:14,158
and the flight path angle
will be negative.

158
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:16,885
So, what is important to realize

159
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:20,516
is that we always have
the flight path angle equal to zero

160
00:10:20,516 --> 00:10:24,898
at the apogee and perigee,
or apoapsis and periapsis

161
00:10:25,898 --> 00:10:29,146
and it's increasing
from the perigee to the apogee

162
00:10:29,146 --> 00:10:31,565
and decreasing
from the apogee to the perigee.
