Hello everyone. Welcome to Unit 2,
Introduction to Orbital Mechanics.

2
00:00:11,604 --> 00:00:14,182
This week, we'll talk about 2.2

3
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:18,451
Concepts of gravitational well
and dynamics of space flight;

4
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:21,719
2.3 Orbital motion and Keppler's laws;

5
00:00:22,979 --> 00:00:26,064
2.4 The case of circular
and elliptical orbits;

6
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:28,127
2.5 Reference frames.

7
00:00:28,947 --> 00:00:32,032
We have prepared some practice quizzes
after each video,

8
00:00:32,032 --> 00:00:36,037
to make sure that you have understood
the concepts explained in these videos.

9
00:00:36,037 --> 00:00:41,827
Each section, from 2.2 to 2.5,
is concluded by a control quiz.

10
00:00:41,827 --> 00:00:45,588
In addition, there is a test
at the end of this unit.

11
00:00:45,588 --> 00:00:49,576
To illustrate the unit,
we have prepared a focus on Rosetta,

12
00:00:49,576 --> 00:00:53,045
with an interview of Andrea Accomazzo,

13
00:00:53,045 --> 00:00:55,942
Head of Solar and Planetary
Missions Division,

14
00:00:55,942 --> 00:01:00,019
and previously,
Rosetta Flight Director at ESA.

15
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:02,204
Looking at this is facultative,

16
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:04,662
but we encourage you
to watch the interview

17
00:01:04,662 --> 00:01:08,276
in order to deepen your knowledge
about this particular subject.
