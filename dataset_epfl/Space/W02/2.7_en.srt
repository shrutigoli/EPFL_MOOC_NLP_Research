1
00:00:08,501 --> 00:00:09,793
I'm Andrea Accomazzo.

2
00:00:09,834 --> 00:00:12,715
I work for the European Space Agency, ESA.

3
00:00:12,716 --> 00:00:16,715
I work as a head of the Planetary
and Solar Missions

4
00:00:16,716 --> 00:00:18,535
Operations Division in ESA,

5
00:00:18,536 --> 00:00:20,556
and I've been the Rosetta Flight Director.

6
00:00:25,264 --> 00:00:28,933
The Rosetta mission has been
one of the master missions

7
00:00:28,934 --> 00:00:30,533
in the history of spaceflight.

8
00:00:30,534 --> 00:00:34,914
The target of the Rosetta mission
was to approach a comet,

9
00:00:34,918 --> 00:00:39,249
land on a comet with the purpose
of characterizing it completely

10
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,354
from a scientific point of view.

11
00:00:41,355 --> 00:00:44,769
Comets are believed to be
the remnants of the formation

12
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,069
of the solar system.

13
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:49,769
And our scientists want to study them
to understand better

14
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:52,779
how the solar system formed,
how our planet formed,

15
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:55,280
and in the end our life developed as well.

16
00:01:00,487 --> 00:01:03,506
To achieve the objectives
of the Rosetta mission,

17
00:01:03,507 --> 00:01:07,006
the planning was massive
and lasted years and years.

18
00:01:07,007 --> 00:01:10,287
The mission has been
one of the most complex missions ever.

19
00:01:10,766 --> 00:01:13,285
First, we wanted to approach a comet.

20
00:01:13,286 --> 00:01:15,295
Comets are orbiting the Sun.

21
00:01:15,296 --> 00:01:17,515
The comets we can approach
are orbiting the Sun

22
00:01:17,516 --> 00:01:21,015
at distances similar to the ones
of Jupiter and the Earth.

23
00:01:21,016 --> 00:01:23,535
So they are relatively faster
than the Earth.

24
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:25,785
So first, we had to reach this comet,

25
00:01:25,786 --> 00:01:28,075
not only in distance
but also in velocity.

26
00:01:28,076 --> 00:01:31,275
And to do this, it took us
ten years to get there.

27
00:01:31,276 --> 00:01:34,525
We continuously
had to accelerate the probe

28
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:36,505
through the solar system for ten years,

29
00:01:36,506 --> 00:01:39,775
such that when we approached
the comet finally in 2014,

30
00:01:39,776 --> 00:01:41,775
we had exactly the same velocity.

31
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:45,725
Only in this way we could really
complete a rendezvous maneuver

32
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:48,520
and stay there together with the comet.

33
00:01:48,521 --> 00:01:52,271
Once there, a completely new
mission started, begun,

34
00:01:52,272 --> 00:01:54,981
and we had to characterize the comet

35
00:01:54,982 --> 00:01:57,142
and develop the rest of the mission.

36
00:02:00,498 --> 00:02:02,547
Once we arrived at the comet,

37
00:02:02,548 --> 00:02:04,897
then we found a totally
different environment.

38
00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:08,896
For ten years, we had been traveling,
like on a motorway,

39
00:02:08,898 --> 00:02:12,327
very fast with very strong
forces and accelerations.

40
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:14,267
Once we arrived at the comet,

41
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:16,097
the environment was totally different.

42
00:02:16,098 --> 00:02:18,287
Everything was extremely delicate.

43
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:21,527
First, we didn't know anything
about the comet itself.

44
00:02:21,528 --> 00:02:23,767
When we fly to Mars or around the Earth,

45
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:25,537
we know everything of these planets.

46
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:28,547
So we perfectly know how to place
a spacecraft in orbit

47
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:29,567
around these planets.

48
00:02:29,568 --> 00:02:31,517
With the comet it was totally different.

49
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:33,547
We didn't even know the mass of the comet.

50
00:02:33,548 --> 00:02:35,067
We didn't even know the shape.

51
00:02:35,068 --> 00:02:38,017
Even the orbit of the comet itself
was not perfectly known

52
00:02:38,018 --> 00:02:39,437
and we wanted to land.

53
00:02:39,438 --> 00:02:43,117
So all these unknowns,
these variables, had to be resolved.

54
00:02:43,118 --> 00:02:45,827
So we started characterizing the comet

55
00:02:45,828 --> 00:02:49,007
and flying next to the comet
very, very slowly,

56
00:02:49,008 --> 00:02:51,548
we could measure the mass of the comet.

57
00:02:52,183 --> 00:02:55,522
By looking at the perturbation
of the trajectory of Rosetta,

58
00:02:55,523 --> 00:02:57,952
we could measure the mass of the comet.

59
00:02:57,953 --> 00:02:59,702
Once we knew the mass of the comet,

60
00:02:59,703 --> 00:03:03,752
then we could plan proper orbits,
proper trajectory, around the comet.

61
00:03:03,753 --> 00:03:07,262
These accelerations
are extremely, extremely small.

62
00:03:07,263 --> 00:03:09,532
Just to give an example,
here on the Earth,

63
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:13,532
we are subject to a gravitational
acceleration of 1g.

64
00:03:13,533 --> 00:03:14,952
On the surface of the comet,

65
00:03:14,953 --> 00:03:19,500
this acceleration is 100,000 times
smaller than this.

66
00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:23,501
So if the lander, Philae, weighs
100 kilograms here on the Earth,

67
00:03:23,502 --> 00:03:25,829
it's one gram on the surface of the comet.

68
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:28,299
Around the comet in orbit
it's even worse.

69
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,739
Gravitational accelerations are in
the order of 10 to the minus 6g,

70
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,519
10 to the minus 7g.

71
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,979
This is far below
the microgravity environment

72
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,479
that astronauts observe
on the Space Station.

73
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:44,289
On top of this, there are
other accelerations

74
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,069
acting on Rosetta with
the same order of magnitude.

75
00:03:47,070 --> 00:03:49,549
We have the aerodynamic acceleration.

76
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:51,519
The comet is throwing out gases.

77
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:53,279
These gases are like wind

78
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,979
impinging on the big
solar arrays of Rosetta.

79
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,519
These are like sails.

80
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:01,919
This aerodynamic's acceleration
is pushing Rosetta slightly away.

81
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,920
It's the same order of magnitude
as the gravitational acceleration.

82
00:04:06,429 --> 00:04:09,078
On top of it, we have
the solar radiation pressure.

83
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:11,038
So the photons emitted by the Sun

84
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:13,988
also impinging on the big
surfaces of Rosetta

85
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:16,118
pushing Rosetta away from the Sun,

86
00:04:16,119 --> 00:04:17,827
same order of magnitude.

87
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:23,168
So the orbital problem of Rosetta
at the comet is much, much more complex

88
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:26,538
than flying a spacecraft
around Mars, around the Earth.

89
00:04:26,539 --> 00:04:30,538
This small acceleration
had to be first characterized

90
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:35,068
and then used to plan the trajectory
of our spacecraft around the comet.

91
00:04:35,069 --> 00:04:38,309
This was the major challenge
of the Rosetta mission.

92
00:04:44,356 --> 00:04:47,995
On top of orbiting the comet
to observe it from orbit,

93
00:04:47,996 --> 00:04:50,785
we even wanted to land
on the surface of the comet.

94
00:04:50,786 --> 00:04:54,465
So this was yet another
challenge for the mission.

95
00:04:54,466 --> 00:04:59,005
First, we had to characterize the comet
well enough to select a landing site

96
00:04:59,006 --> 00:05:02,767
and then in the end,
we had to drop our small lander.

97
00:05:02,768 --> 00:05:04,527
Just to give you a feeling,

98
00:05:04,528 --> 00:05:06,237
the comet is five kilometers big.

99
00:05:06,238 --> 00:05:08,505
It's like a big mountain in the Alps.

100
00:05:08,506 --> 00:05:09,543
Take the Mont Blanc.

101
00:05:09,548 --> 00:05:11,737
Mont Blanc is five kilometers big.

102
00:05:11,738 --> 00:05:13,197
The day we dropped the lander,

103
00:05:13,198 --> 00:05:16,277
we were flying at 22 kilometers
altitude with Rosetta.

104
00:05:16,278 --> 00:05:19,767
This is like flying at twice
the altitude of a normal airplane.

105
00:05:19,768 --> 00:05:23,277
Then we dropped our lander
out of the window of the airplane.

106
00:05:23,278 --> 00:05:25,307
The lander is as big as a washing machine,

107
00:05:25,308 --> 00:05:28,799
and this washing machine
has been falling alone

108
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,009
for 22 kilometers
at very, very low velocity.

109
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,960
It took seven hours to go down.

110
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,050
So this is a ballistic flight.

111
00:05:36,051 --> 00:05:39,030
It's just like dropping a stone
from an aircraft,

112
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:41,530
and we had to hit a glacier
on the Mont Blanc

113
00:05:41,531 --> 00:05:43,510
with a very high accuracy.

114
00:05:43,511 --> 00:05:46,500
To give you an idea of the accuracy
we had to achieve,

115
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:50,492
if we had committed an error
of one centimeter per second

116
00:05:50,493 --> 00:05:52,222
in the velocity of Rosetta

117
00:05:52,223 --> 00:05:55,672
when releasing Philae
before its fall,

118
00:05:55,673 --> 00:05:56,976
propagated for seven hours,

119
00:05:56,977 --> 00:06:00,976
this one centimeter per second
is 250 meters error

120
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:02,246
on the surfacing position

121
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:03,976
and this we couldn't afford.

122
00:06:03,977 --> 00:06:06,496
So we had to maneuver
very, very carefully Rosetta.

123
00:06:06,497 --> 00:06:09,777
This was the trick of this operation,

124
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:11,807
such that the moment we released Philae,

125
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:15,488
then Philae would fall according to
the trajectory we had planned.

126
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:18,535
In reconstructing the trajectory
of Rosetta a posteriori,

127
00:06:18,536 --> 00:06:21,294
we realized that we had a wrong
velocity of Rosetta

128
00:06:21,295 --> 00:06:25,524
1.7 millimeters per second
and 32 meters in position

129
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:27,287
at the time of release of Philae.

130
00:06:27,288 --> 00:06:30,998
All this done at 500 million
kilometers away from the Earth.

131
00:06:35,459 --> 00:06:41,788
Operating Rosetta proposes challenges
much higher than any other mission.

132
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:44,521
The first difficulty
is the trajectory itself.

133
00:06:44,522 --> 00:06:47,801
The trajectory of the spacecraft
or the orbit, if you prefer,

134
00:06:47,802 --> 00:06:50,027
is not stable for a very long time

135
00:06:50,028 --> 00:06:54,027
around such a small object
with such small acceleration,

136
00:06:54,028 --> 00:06:56,537
so similar accelerations.

137
00:06:56,538 --> 00:06:59,527
So what we had to do is continuously plan

138
00:06:59,528 --> 00:07:01,907
the trajectory of Rosetta at the comet.

139
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:04,777
And this we had to do
minimum twice a week.

140
00:07:04,778 --> 00:07:07,767
On another spacecraft,
like Venus Express around Venus,

141
00:07:07,768 --> 00:07:10,257
or Mars Express around Mars,
it's much easier.

142
00:07:10,258 --> 00:07:11,547
We plan the trajectory.

143
00:07:11,548 --> 00:07:15,787
The trajectory is stable and predictable
for months if not years.

144
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:18,073
Every now and then,
we do correction maneuvers,

145
00:07:18,074 --> 00:07:21,523
but we are talking about weeks,
months, even longer sometimes.

146
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:23,113
Rosetta is not the case.

147
00:07:23,114 --> 00:07:25,793
So the first big challenge
of operating Rosetta is this

148
00:07:25,794 --> 00:07:28,794
continuous maneuvering around the comet.

149
00:07:29,085 --> 00:07:31,794
The second one is the environment itself.

150
00:07:31,795 --> 00:07:34,984
Rosetta flies in a very active
environment.

151
00:07:34,985 --> 00:07:36,924
There are winds coming out of the comet

152
00:07:36,925 --> 00:07:40,064
because it's emitting gases,
this ice that is sublimating

153
00:07:40,065 --> 00:07:43,274
and is impinging on the solar arrays,
blowing the space away.

154
00:07:43,275 --> 00:07:44,994
And this environment is changing.

155
00:07:44,995 --> 00:07:46,994
The comet is approaching the Sun.

156
00:07:46,995 --> 00:07:48,544
It's getting hotter and hotter.

157
00:07:48,545 --> 00:07:50,494
There are more gases coming out.

158
00:07:50,495 --> 00:07:51,564
There is more dust.

159
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:55,274
These gases, when they sublimate,
they crack the surface of the comet

160
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:58,765
and there is dust particles
coming out of the comet itself.

161
00:07:59,047 --> 00:08:02,526
These dust particles
are fooling our star tracker.

162
00:08:02,527 --> 00:08:05,286
The star tracker recognizes
the star patterns,

163
00:08:05,287 --> 00:08:07,966
knows how Rosetta is oriented in space.

164
00:08:07,967 --> 00:08:09,596
But if there are dust particles,

165
00:08:09,597 --> 00:08:12,564
then it doesn't know whether
these are stars or dust particles.

166
00:08:12,565 --> 00:08:15,546
And when the star tracker doesn't know
how Rosetta is oriented,

167
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:17,256
then we cannot communicate with the Earth.

168
00:08:17,257 --> 00:08:19,889
We cannot point the high gain
antenna through the Earth,

169
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,006
and this is a problem.

170
00:08:21,007 --> 00:08:23,526
So operating Rosetta
is a continuous challenge

171
00:08:23,527 --> 00:08:25,536
because the comet environment

172
00:08:25,537 --> 00:08:28,926
in which we are flying
is continuously changing.

173
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:32,926
And this is a continuous evolution
of the mission planning we had to do.

174
00:08:32,927 --> 00:08:36,517
We had to follow exactly
the behavior of the comet over time.

175
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:45,720
Now in summer 2015,
we flew through the perihelion

176
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:47,010
of the orbit of the comet.

177
00:08:47,011 --> 00:08:49,404
So it's the closest point
of the orbit of the comet

178
00:08:49,405 --> 00:08:50,210
to the Sun.

179
00:08:50,211 --> 00:08:52,970
We observed the peak
activity of the comet

180
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:55,250
around September 2015.

181
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:58,580
Now the comet is going away,
far away from the Sun.

182
00:08:58,581 --> 00:09:02,530
So what this means is the comet
is cooling down again.

183
00:09:02,531 --> 00:09:04,270
So Rosetta can go again closer.

184
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:07,490
In the past months
we had to fly up to 400 kilometers

185
00:09:07,491 --> 00:09:08,830
away from the nucleus.

186
00:09:08,831 --> 00:09:11,520
Now we are approaching
again the comet.

187
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:14,270
We are currently below 100 kilometers.

188
00:09:14,271 --> 00:09:19,040
In the course of 2016,
we will approach again the comet.

189
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:22,300
Unfortunately, we will not be able
to operate Rosetta

190
00:09:22,301 --> 00:09:24,260
beyond September 2016.

191
00:09:24,261 --> 00:09:27,000
So what we'll have to do
is to plan the end of mission.

192
00:09:27,001 --> 00:09:28,819
We had several options

193
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:32,509
but the option we have selected
is actually to land the spacecraft itself

194
00:09:32,510 --> 00:09:34,269
onto the surface of the comet.

195
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:37,229
Rosetta is not planned to land
on the surface of the comet

196
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,979
so it will not survive this impact,

197
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,529
but we will fly very, very low altitude.

198
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,249
In the last weeks before
this touchdown of Rosetta,

199
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,029
we plan to fly very, very low orbits.

200
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:52,986
We think we can safely go
below one kilometer altitude

201
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:54,756
from the surface of the comet

202
00:09:54,757 --> 00:09:56,546
maybe up to 200 meters.

203
00:09:56,547 --> 00:09:58,986
So we should be able
to get spectacular images,

204
00:09:58,987 --> 00:10:02,496
and one day we will decide
that we will do a final touchdown

205
00:10:02,497 --> 00:10:04,026
on the surface of the comet,

206
00:10:04,027 --> 00:10:06,557
and this will be the end
of this fantastic mission.

207
00:10:09,479 --> 00:10:14,158
I went back to my original role,
my current role within the agency,

208
00:10:14,159 --> 00:10:18,089
which is the Head of the Solar
and Planetary Missions Division.

209
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:21,289
In this role, I have to take care
not only of Rosetta

210
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,726
but also other seven missions.

211
00:10:22,727 --> 00:10:25,779
Some of them are in flight,
like Mars Express and Cluster.

212
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:27,264
Some others are in preparation.

213
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:28,793
We are about to launch ExoMars.

214
00:10:28,794 --> 00:10:31,537
We are preparing BepiColombo
to fly to Mercury.

215
00:10:31,538 --> 00:10:33,139
We are preparing Solar Orbiter.

216
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,509
We are preparing JUICE
to fly to Jupiter.

217
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,529
So my role is being, sort of,
project manager

218
00:10:38,530 --> 00:10:41,769
for the preparation of the operations
for these missions.

219
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,775
I'm not responsible--

220
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:46,179
we are not responsible for the design
of the spacecraft itself

221
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,669
but we are responsible
for the design of the mission,

222
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:51,548
of the design of the systems
we will use on ground

223
00:10:51,549 --> 00:10:53,298
to control the spacecraft,

224
00:10:53,299 --> 00:10:56,538
and we are responsible
for the design of the operations.

225
00:10:56,539 --> 00:10:59,528
I'm overseeing personally
all these projects,

226
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:03,939
so I'm interacting daily
with all the single

227
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,568
responsible of the project

228
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:09,339
and we are preparing our systems
to fly in these new missions in space.

229
00:11:15,517 --> 00:11:19,036
I've been extremely lucky and privileged
in having had the chance

230
00:11:19,037 --> 00:11:21,786
to work in interplanetary missions,

231
00:11:21,787 --> 00:11:23,306
on the Rosetta missions,

232
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:27,306
but the beauty of ESA goes beyond
the single project, I personally believe.

233
00:11:27,307 --> 00:11:29,786
ESA offers an environment
where you meet people

234
00:11:29,787 --> 00:11:31,446
from all over the world.

235
00:11:31,447 --> 00:11:35,077
You work in one of the most fascinating
domains that we have.

236
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:38,277
There are difficulties also
working in this environment.

237
00:11:38,278 --> 00:11:41,747
ESA is governed by political bodies.

238
00:11:41,748 --> 00:11:44,537
These political bodies are now
more than 20 countries

239
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,267
contributing to ESA.

240
00:11:46,268 --> 00:11:48,797
So there's no single country
that decides a program

241
00:11:48,798 --> 00:11:49,777
and implements it.

242
00:11:49,778 --> 00:11:51,807
It's always a continuous agreement

243
00:11:51,808 --> 00:11:53,547
but it's a very democratic process

244
00:11:53,548 --> 00:11:57,548
and this I find extremely positive
in the world of today.

245
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:01,529
And this is also reflected
in the day-to-day work we do.

246
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,519
We have many nationalities

247
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:06,759
and one thing I've appreciated
in all these years spent at ESA

248
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,549
is the fact that people
come with their feature,

249
00:12:09,550 --> 00:12:10,859
with their characteristics.

250
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:14,249
I'm Italian and we all know
the characteristics of Italians.

251
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,769
The beauty of ESA is that all
these characteristics come together

252
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,239
and only the most positive ones
are filtered and maintained.

253
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,969
So you get the best you can
get out of such an environment.

254
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,239
This is extremely positive

255
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,239
and I think it's a message
that we should bring into our society

256
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,049
of nowadays where there are
many problems of these kinds,

257
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,500
so actually we can have a better future.

258
00:12:40,974 --> 00:12:44,093
I personally graduated
in aerospace engineering

259
00:12:44,094 --> 00:12:46,503
at the Polytechnic of Milano in Italy.

260
00:12:46,504 --> 00:12:49,073
Then I wanted to work
in space, absolutely.

261
00:12:49,074 --> 00:12:53,074
I started my career as a design engineer
in an Italian company.

262
00:12:53,517 --> 00:12:56,286
Then slowly I got involved
in the Rosetta mission.

263
00:12:56,287 --> 00:12:59,756
I got in touch with
the operations center of ESA

264
00:12:59,757 --> 00:13:02,516
in Germany, in Darmstadt
where I currently work.

265
00:13:02,517 --> 00:13:06,226
At a certain stage I was hired
as a spacecraft operations

266
00:13:06,227 --> 00:13:08,276
engineer for the Rosetta mission.

267
00:13:08,277 --> 00:13:12,537
This is the first time I really
actually dealt with space operations

268
00:13:12,889 --> 00:13:16,028
but I immediately realized
that this was my domain.

269
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,818
This is something that I really liked

270
00:13:17,819 --> 00:13:21,518
and I feel born to do, actually, this job.

271
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,068
So this is what I started doing.

272
00:13:23,069 --> 00:13:25,768
I worked a few years
for the Rosetta mission.

273
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:27,308
We came to the launch.

274
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:29,888
Then I was reassigned
as spacecraft operations manager

275
00:13:29,889 --> 00:13:31,798
for the Venus Express mission,

276
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,383
and after these, an experience
of two and a half years,

277
00:13:34,384 --> 00:13:36,058
where we launched Venus Express,

278
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,888
we did orbit insertion at Venus,

279
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,528
we brought the mission
into routine operations.

280
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:42,548
Then I came back to the Rosetta mission

281
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:44,758
as a spacecraft operations manager

282
00:13:44,759 --> 00:13:47,998
and I kept this role until shortly before
arriving at the comet

283
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:50,969
when I became the flight director
for this mission.
