We hope that you enjoyed this week with us.
Thanks very much for your attendance.
I'd like you to focus on the concepts presented in these units.
Once these concepts are clearly understood, including their application, you can take the final test of the unit.
We'd like to remind you, also, about the focus on Rosetta, with the interview of Andrea Accomazzo,
Head of Solar and Planetary
Missions Division, and previously Rosetta Flight Director.
