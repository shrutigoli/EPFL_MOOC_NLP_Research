Today we'll cover the subject of circular and elliptical orbits.
Obviously, a fundamental subject for what will follow in the course.
Now we'll determine the circular velocity on a circular orbit and it's a simple expression:
The centrifugal force on a circular orbit is equal to the gravitational force.
So, generally speaking, we have the inertial force equal to the gravitational force.
When you have the motion of a spacecraft or a celestial body in a gravitational field, so we have <i>(VÂ²) / r</i> which is the centrifugal force equal to <i>Âµ / (rÂ²)</i>, this is per unit mass and we can derive the circular velocity and that's a fundamental relationship that we'll use very often, the circular velocity
<i>V</i> equal: <i>V_circ</i> =<i>âˆš (Âµ/ r)</i>
Now we can, on the basis of this, we can immediately determine the expression for the third Keppler's law the relationship between the period of the orbit and the radius of a circular orbit, respectively the semi-major axis and you can see this here the period equal <i>(2 Ï€ r)/V</i>
It's the total path on the circular orbit divided by velocity.
If you replace <i>V</i> by the expression that we had before,
<i>âˆš(Âµ/r)</i> you find Keppler's law for circular orbit;
T=2Ï€ âˆš(rÂ³/Âµ) and this is valid also for an elliptical orbit, although it's somewhat more difficult to determine that, to prove and I will not do this here, but what we found for the circular orbit is valid also for an elliptical orbit where you replace <i>r</i> by <i>a</i>.
T=2Ï€ âˆš(aÂ³/Âµ)
This is the third of Keppler's laws.
Here we have an ellipse, basically an elliptical orbit and I will describe some of the fundamental parameters of an elliptical orbit.
First of all, let's talk about the periapsis and the apoapsis.
This is the line of apsides, which is a line between the point on the orbit closest to the focus, where the central body is, and the point on the orbit the furthest away from the focus.
Periapsis and apoapsis are general terms.
If we have the Earth as the central body, we're talking about perigee, apogee; if we have the Sun, it's going to be perihelion and aphelion.
But generally speaking, again, periapsis and apoapsis.
Now we have the distance <i>r</i> from the center of the central body and the spacecraft or the planet if the central body is the Sun.
The velocity <i>V</i>, and <i>Ï´</i> is the so-called 
<i>True anomaly</i>.
This is an important term.
The term itself seems strange, but this is all historical.
The <i>True anomaly</i> is the angle between the direction of the periapsis from the central body to the radius vector to the spacecraft or the planet.
Now, in terms of the ellipse itself, obviously, we have the semi-major axis, the distance between the center of the ellipse and either the apoapsis and the periapsis.
<i>c</i> is <i>a</i>, the semi major axis, multiplied by the eccentricity is the distance between the center of the ellipse and the focus.
Obviously, if we have <i>c</i> = 0 we have a circular orbit.
If <i>c</i> becomes larger and larger, it means that the eccentricity is becoming closer and closer to 1 and the limit case of eccentricity one is the case of a parabolic orbit.
Now we have, from the central body, the distance to the apoapsis
<i>r_a</i> and the distance to the periapsis, which is <i>r_p</i>
<i>b</i> is the semi-minor axis.
These are the parameters that we'll consider in the future, again: semi-major axis, semi-minor axis, eccentricity < 1 for an ellipse and zero for a circle.
<i>r_a</i> and <i>r_p</i>, the distance to the apoapsis and periapsis; velocity, and the true anomaly.
These are the important parameters on an elliptical orbit.
Let's look at the energy of the orbital motion and orbital velocity.
Now, a fundamental expression is obviously the energy.
The total energy in a gravitational field is going to be the sum of the kinetic energy and the potential energy.
We have seen this before.
Per unit mass: <i>VÂ²/2 - Âµ/r</i>
What is interesting is that if you replace the <i>V</i> by the escape velocity,
<i>âˆš(2Âµ/r)</i> you find that the energy of the orbital motion is zero so the limit case of a very elongated ellipse, you get total energy close to zero.
In the limit case of a parabolic orbit, you have a total energy equal to zero.
Now, if you have a <i>V</i> < escape velocity, which is obviously the case for a closed orbit, you have a negative energy.
So, a circular orbit or elliptical orbit, even relatively large eccentricities, always total negative energy.
Energy total zero for a parabolic orbit, and we'll see later if we have a hyperbolic orbit, then you have a total energy which is positive.
Now, if you replace here the <i>V</i> by the circular velocity on a circular orbit,
V = âˆš(Âµ/r) you find that total energy <i>&#949;= -Âµ/(2r)</i> and we can generalize this with this value here, total energy in an elliptical orbit = -Âµ/(2a) which is interesting, because it depends only on <i>a</i> and not at all on the eccentricity.
On the basis of this expression of the conservation of energy we can determine what is the value, on an elliptical orbit, of the velocity as a function of the distance to the central body and it's not a completely simple derivation but we come to the conclusion that the velocity = âˆš(2Âµ/r - Âµ/a)
This is a fundamental expression that we'll use very often in the future.
You can see with this expression that if you replace <i>a</i> by <i>r</i>, which is the case of a circular orbit, then <i>V</i> you find again,
V = âˆš(Âµ/r) for a circular orbit and again, this expression of the velocity as a function of <i>r</i> on an elliptical orbit is fundamental.
We'll use this quite often in the future.
How about angular momentum?
We have here the spacecraft and here the central body and the radius vector <i>r</i> between the center of the central body and the spacecraft.
You have the velocity vector, which, in this drawing, is in a direction away from the perpendicular to the radius vector, and a very important parameter is gamma.
It's called the flight path angle.
It's the angle between the direction of the velocity vector and the perpendicular to the radius vector at the point where the spacecraft is.
It's quite an important parameter, because in practice, for instance with the Space Shuttle, when we had so-called main engine cutoff at the end of the powered ascent, we had to have a slightly positive flight path angle which means that when we had orbit insertion, we had to be on a trajectory that was going to take us to the apogee of our orbit, which was about 45 minutes after main engine cutoff and the altitude of the apogee, by definition, was larger than the altitude at which we had main engine cutoff and at the apogee, which was way outside of the atmosphere, typically to the order of 200 or 300 kliometers, we had to do a posi-grade burn or we had to accelerate in order to circularize at that altitude.
If we had not done that, we would have come back to the altitude of the main engine cutoff which was in the very high atmosphere, typically 120 kilometers.
So the flight path angle, again, a very important parameter and we'll talk very often about that in the future of the course.
Then you have the value of the angular momentum, obviously,
<i>j vector</i> = <i>r vector</i> cross product <i>V</i> and the amplitude of the angular momentum is just <i>r</i> times <i>V</i> times the cosine of the flight path angle.
The variation of the flight path angle on an elliptical orbit is a function of the position.
If we start with the periapsis, obviously, we have a flight path angle equal to zero.
As we go on the elliptical orbit towards the apogee, we are going to have <i>r</i> increasing, obviously, the distance increasing, but also, the flight path angle will go to positive values.
Then when we get at the apogee, it will be, again, zero.
Then it will decrease, <i>r</i> will decrease obviously as we go back towards the perigee and the flight path angle will be negative.
So, what is important to realize is that we always have the flight path angle equal to zero at the apogee and perigee, or apoapsis and periapsis and it's increasing from the perigee to the apogee and decreasing from the apogee to the perigee.
