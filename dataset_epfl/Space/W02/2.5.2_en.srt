1
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:09,433
The classical orbital parameters,
there are six of them,

2
00:00:09,433 --> 00:00:12,050
and they describe completely the orbits.

3
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:15,146
If we add the time, the actual time,
then you will know exactly

4
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:19,381
where the spacecraft is
with respect to the central body.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,720
We have, first of all,
the plane of reference,

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,102
and if we talk about an orbit
of a spacecraft around the Earth,

7
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:32,754
obviously the plane of reference
is the plane of the Equator.

8
00:00:32,754 --> 00:00:36,545
If it's orbits in the solar system
the plane of reference

9
00:00:36,545 --> 00:00:37,844
will be the plane of the ecliptic,

10
00:00:37,844 --> 00:00:41,420
the plane of the orbit
of the Earth around the Sun.

11
00:00:41,897 --> 00:00:46,281
And we described already
the directions of <i>x</i>, <i>y</i>, and <i>z</i>,

12
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:48,266
inertial coordinate system.

13
00:00:48,502 --> 00:00:51,193
Now, in the plane of reference,

14
00:00:51,193 --> 00:00:53,645
let's take the case
of an orbit around the Earth,

15
00:00:53,645 --> 00:00:56,581
the plane of reference being
the plane of the Equator.

16
00:00:56,581 --> 00:01:00,527
We have the reference direction;
we talked about it before also,

17
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:03,972
the direction of the vernal equinox
for a certain time,

18
00:01:03,972 --> 00:01:05,782
for instance the year 2000,

19
00:01:05,782 --> 00:01:09,600
and it's also the direction of <i>x</i>
in the planar reference,

20
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,895
so <i>y</i> being perpendicular to <i>x</i>
and <i>z</i> being to the North Pole.

21
00:01:14,614 --> 00:01:20,356
Now, in the parameters we talked
already about <i>e</i> and <i>a</i>

22
00:01:21,134 --> 00:01:23,997
<i>a</i>, in a way, gives the size of the orbit,

23
00:01:23,997 --> 00:01:26,257
<i>e</i> will give the shape of the orbit,

24
00:01:26,257 --> 00:01:28,841
we talk here about elliptical orbits,

25
00:01:28,841 --> 00:01:31,303
then an important parameter is <i>i</i>,

26
00:01:31,303 --> 00:01:35,060
the inclination of the orbital plane,

27
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,937
which is also the angle

28
00:01:38,937 --> 00:01:42,415
between the north direction

29
00:01:42,415 --> 00:01:46,511
and the rotation vector

30
00:01:46,975 --> 00:01:49,785
of the motion of the spacecraft

31
00:01:49,785 --> 00:01:51,454
around the center of the Earth.

32
00:01:51,765 --> 00:01:54,748
Inclination of the orbital plane, <i>i</i> = 0

33
00:01:54,748 --> 00:01:57,257
means equatorial orbits
are equal to 90 degrees,

34
00:01:57,257 --> 00:01:59,158
it means a polar orbit.

35
00:01:59,998 --> 00:02:03,300
We have then the longitude

36
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,122
or right ascension of the ascending node.

37
00:02:07,404 --> 00:02:09,297
The ascending node is here.

38
00:02:09,297 --> 00:02:11,523
The spacecraft going in this direction

39
00:02:11,523 --> 00:02:16,905
is passing from the southern
celestial hemisphere to the northern

40
00:02:17,484 --> 00:02:19,062
on a point on the plane of reference

41
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:21,427
which is the so-called ascending node.

42
00:02:21,427 --> 00:02:23,554
The descending node
is just on the other side,

43
00:02:23,554 --> 00:02:27,097
where the spacecraft go
from the north to the south.

44
00:02:28,045 --> 00:02:29,482
The longitude of the ascending node

45
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:32,187
is the angle between the direction of <i>x</i>

46
00:02:32,187 --> 00:02:36,621
and the direction of the ascending node
from the center of the Earth.

47
00:02:37,794 --> 00:02:42,698
We have then the argument
of the periapsis in the orbital plane.

48
00:02:42,698 --> 00:02:47,229
We use always a term
<i>longitude</i> or <i>right ascension</i>

49
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:49,985
in the plane of reference,
but in the plane of the orbit

50
00:02:49,985 --> 00:02:51,939
we use the term <i>argument</i>.

51
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,499
So the argument of the periapsis

52
00:02:53,499 --> 00:02:56,233
is the angle between the line of nodes

53
00:02:56,233 --> 00:02:57,972
or the direction of the ascending node

54
00:02:57,972 --> 00:03:00,663
and the direction of the periapsis,

55
00:03:00,663 --> 00:03:02,850
which is here on this drawing.

56
00:03:03,515 --> 00:03:08,019
Now, we have these five parameters so far.

57
00:03:08,019 --> 00:03:12,496
We have a sixth one, which is
the time of periapsis transit,

58
00:03:12,496 --> 00:03:15,773
at what time the spacecraft
was at this location.

59
00:03:16,165 --> 00:03:19,084
If, in addition, we give
the current time, <i>t</i>,

60
00:03:19,084 --> 00:03:23,177
then we have the precise position
of the spacecraft around the Earth.

61
00:03:23,686 --> 00:03:27,169
In practice we don't use that much
all these orbital parameters,

62
00:03:27,169 --> 00:03:29,230
the classical orbital parameters,

63
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:34,611
but we use more the concept
of the so-called <i>state vector</i>.

64
00:03:35,944 --> 00:03:42,862
The state vector, as we see here,
is <i>X, Y, Z, Ẋ, Ẏ, Ż</i>, and the time,

65
00:03:42,862 --> 00:03:46,368
and this is obviously with respect
to inertial coordinate system.

66
00:03:46,368 --> 00:03:48,906
Let's take, again,
the example of a spacecraft

67
00:03:48,906 --> 00:03:50,138
on orbit around the Earth.

68
00:03:50,138 --> 00:03:54,048
It's going to be <i>X, Y, Z, Ẋ, Ẏ, Ż</i>

69
00:03:54,048 --> 00:03:58,436
in the geocentric-inertial
coordinate system.

70
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:04,252
Now you have six parameters
in the state vector,

71
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:07,278
and onboard the Space Shuttle,
for instance,

72
00:04:07,278 --> 00:04:09,369
we had in the onboard computers

73
00:04:09,369 --> 00:04:12,786
a constant so-called propagation
of the state vector.

74
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:16,729
The Shuttle knew always where it was,
and what its velocity was,

75
00:04:16,729 --> 00:04:20,086
and as it was integrating
the laws of motion

76
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:22,925
it knew also exactly where
it was going to be in one hour,

77
00:04:22,925 --> 00:04:25,810
or where it was an hour ago.

78
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:27,614
Propagation of the state vector.

79
00:04:27,614 --> 00:04:30,160
And you can imagine,
if you are on the Space Shuttle,

80
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,933
and you have a knowledge,
within the Space Shuttle,

81
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:35,955
of the exact position and velocity vector,

82
00:04:35,955 --> 00:04:39,057
and you also propagate, for instance,
the state vector of a target.

83
00:04:39,057 --> 00:04:41,337
If you do a rendezvous with a target

84
00:04:41,337 --> 00:04:44,380
then if you have these two state vectors,

85
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:49,285
you have an idea in which direction
and what distance the target is.

86
00:04:49,285 --> 00:04:52,698
So in a rendezvous 
that we'll cover later in the course

87
00:04:52,698 --> 00:04:55,965
the propagation of the own
state vector of the chaser,

88
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:58,459
and the state vector of the target

89
00:04:58,459 --> 00:05:01,651
is a very useful tool
to perform a rendezvous.

90
00:05:01,651 --> 00:05:04,324
But, again, there is
a one-to-one correlation

91
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:08,060
between the six parameters
of the state vector

92
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:13,302
and the six classical orbital parameters
that we talked about before.

93
00:05:14,637 --> 00:05:17,780
Let's talk about the mean solar day
and the sidereal day.

94
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,037
The sidereal day, first of all,
is the time it takes

95
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:27,214
for the Earth to make one full rotation
with respect to the stars.

96
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:31,565
The mean solar day is
the time it takes for the Earth

97
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:34,761
to make one full rotation
with respect to the Sun.

98
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:36,750
And we talk about mean solar day,

99
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:39,661
because as the orbit
of the Earth around the Sun

100
00:05:39,661 --> 00:05:43,661
is not circular but elliptical,
the time it takes

101
00:05:43,661 --> 00:05:48,454
for two consecutive passes
of the Sun in the meridian,

102
00:05:48,454 --> 00:05:52,408
of a given point on the surface
of the Earth, varies a little bit,

103
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:55,657
in a very slight manner along the year,

104
00:05:55,657 --> 00:05:59,018
so we talk about the mean solar day,
but the sidereal day is fixed.

105
00:05:59,444 --> 00:06:05,143
And if we take the situation here,
where one given day,

106
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:10,866
we look to the south at what the meridian,
the meridian is a plane,

107
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:16,183
south, zenith, north,
in the meridional plane we have,

108
00:06:16,183 --> 00:06:21,248
at the same time, the Sun
and the star crossing the meridian.

109
00:06:21,904 --> 00:06:27,865
Now, after 23 hours
and 56 minutes and 04 seconds,

110
00:06:28,316 --> 00:06:31,193
and this is one sidereal day,

111
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:37,161
we have the star, in red,
again in the meridian.

112
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:41,087
And the sun has moved,
with respect to the stars,

113
00:06:41,087 --> 00:06:46,147
a little bit to the left,
about one degree per day.

114
00:06:46,147 --> 00:06:50,041
That's the motion of the Sun
with respect to the stars,

115
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:54,844
because it's one complete revolution
of 360 degrees in one full year,

116
00:06:54,844 --> 00:06:57,443
so it's about one degree per day

117
00:06:58,193 --> 00:07:02,184
to the east or to the left.

118
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:05,171
So, after one sidereal day,
we have the star,

119
00:07:05,171 --> 00:07:08,117
which is, again, crossing the meridian,

120
00:07:08,117 --> 00:07:11,747
and it takes a little more time
until the Sun crosses the meridian,

121
00:07:11,747 --> 00:07:14,408
and it's about 3 minutes 56 seconds more,

122
00:07:14,408 --> 00:07:18,838
so that the duration
of the mean solar day is 24 hours,

123
00:07:18,838 --> 00:07:21,143
but the duration of the sidereal day,

124
00:07:21,143 --> 00:07:23,853
rotation of the Earth
with respect to the star,

125
00:07:23,853 --> 00:07:25,678
is about four minutes less.

126
00:07:26,954 --> 00:07:29,535
The Gregorian days versus Julian days.

127
00:07:29,535 --> 00:07:32,671
In fact, the Gregorian calendar,
which is the calendar we use,

128
00:07:32,671 --> 00:07:36,783
divided in years, in months,
weeks and days,

129
00:07:37,904 --> 00:07:40,150
is not ideal for astronomers

130
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:45,983
and for people who are managing
and planning space missions

131
00:07:45,983 --> 00:07:48,598
with spacecrafts that are moving,

132
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:51,394
either around the Earth
or in the solar system.

133
00:07:51,394 --> 00:07:55,190
You like to have a system where the days
are counting progressively upwards

134
00:07:55,190 --> 00:08:01,043
without having this awkward division
in years, months, and days.

135
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:06,114
I'm not going to go into the detail
of the explanation of the Julian days,

136
00:08:06,114 --> 00:08:12,033
but let's say that on January the first,

137
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,943
of the year 2000,

138
00:08:13,943 --> 00:08:16,362
at zero hours universal time,

139
00:08:16,362 --> 00:08:21,585
you had a Julian day 245 1544.

140
00:08:21,585 --> 00:08:24,002
It was the middle of that Julian day.

141
00:08:24,002 --> 00:08:27,855
And then the Julian days are increasing,
one after the other,

142
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:33,807
constantly increasing by one day
per day in the Gregorian calendar.

143
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:38,897
But, again, you don't have
that awkward division,

144
00:08:38,897 --> 00:08:43,810
which is impractical for astronomers
and experts in the space systems.

145
00:08:44,701 --> 00:08:48,274
Julian day is used very, very commonly

146
00:08:48,274 --> 00:08:52,001
in astronomy and in the space business.

147
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:54,731
Now, we have an expression
allowing the conversion

148
00:08:54,731 --> 00:08:56,949
of Gregorian days into Julian Days.

149
00:08:56,949 --> 00:08:59,460
It's really complicated;
I won't go into the detail of that,

150
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:04,749
but so that you know,
on a given Gregorian day,

151
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:09,441
a certain year, certain month,
and certain day in the month,

152
00:09:09,441 --> 00:09:11,952
then you can convert
into the Julian day, use that formula.

153
00:09:13,259 --> 00:09:15,578
Use it if you need to.

154
00:09:15,578 --> 00:09:17,529
Again, it's not very common to use it,

155
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:20,715
because usually we just use Julian days.

156
00:09:20,715 --> 00:09:23,394
We have a launch of a spacecraft
on a given Julian day,

157
00:09:23,394 --> 00:09:27,656
and so many Julian days later
it will get to gravity assist

158
00:09:27,656 --> 00:09:31,560
around a planet, like Venus, or Mars,

159
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,326
and then if we go to Jupiter,
or it will go to a comet

160
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:38,389
like the Rosetta spacecraft
of the European Space Agency,

161
00:09:38,389 --> 00:09:40,951
and then after a certain number
of Julian days

162
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:43,426
it will get in a rendezvous
with a comet,

163
00:09:43,426 --> 00:09:46,097
and it's much more practical
to use that scale

164
00:09:46,097 --> 00:09:48,958
rather than the Gregorian calendar scale.
