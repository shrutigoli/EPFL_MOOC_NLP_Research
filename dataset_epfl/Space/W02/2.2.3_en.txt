The question is now how to escape from the Earth's gravitational influence.
In fact, you can never completely escape the Earth's gravitational influence, because it goes to infinity, but of course it becomes very rapidly extremely small.
Basically, the idea of escaping the Earth's gravitational influence is to bring a mass from the vicinity of the Earth all the way to infinity at a zero velocity.
If you have a non-zero velocity at large distance, or, let's say, at infinity, at the limit, then you have done more than what is needed to just escape the gravitational influence of the Earth.
Now, there's a slow method, which is inefficient.
Imagine that you have a rocket that has a thrust-to-weight ratio which is just a little bit larger than one.
It will slowly move away from the launch pad, and it will not move very much, and it will use a lot of propellant for not going very far at the limit, if you have exactly a thrust equal to the weight of the rocket.
With an adjustment of the thrust, taken to account the fact that you are using propellant, you are going to have a rocket sitting there in mid air and going nowhere, but using a lot of propellant.
So, the efficient method of escaping the vicinity of the Earth, and trying to go towards infinity with a zero velocity, which, again, is the limit of escape of the Earth's gravitational influence, it's better to give a big kick.
You could do it, of course, with a big gun, and have a bullet moving vertically at a certain velocity, and this is the so-called
<i>escape velocity</i>, which is the velocity at which you have to leave the surface of the Earth in order for your spacecraft, which has been ejected in this way, to go to infinity with a zero velocity.
Now, if you equal the work needed to bring a unit mass from the surface of the Earth to infinity: we determined this is equal to <i>g_0 times R</i>- the gravitational acceleration of the surface of the Earth, and the radius of the Earth - if we equal this to kinetic energy, <i>Â½ V_Esc</i>, then you can determine the value of <i>V_Esc</i>, and you find that it's equal to the square root of <i>2 Î¼ / R</i>.
We saw that already before, but this is another way to determine the value of the escape velocity from the surface of the Earth.
You can do the same thing, not from the surface of the Earth, but from a certain distance, <i>r</i>, to the center of the Earth, and you are going to find the kinetic energy, if you equal this to the work needed to bring a unit mass from that location here to infinity, so we saw before that it's equal to the gravitational acceleration at that distance from the center of the Earth, times that distance, <i>r</i>, to the center of the Earth.
And, again, you can find the escape velocity for the value of <i>r</i> to the center of the Earth is equal to the square root of <i>2 Î¼ / r</i>.
So this is a general value of the escape velocity for any distance <i>r</i> to the center of the Earth.
Let's look at circular velocity.
Here you have the Space Shuttle on a circular orbit, with a certain velocity, <i>V_Circ</i>, typically of the order for Low Earth Orbit of 7.7â€”7.8 km/s, or going around the Earth in about an hour and a half.
And you have, of course, a gravitational force exercised on the Shuttle, and we know its value for a distance <i>r</i> to the center of the Earth, and you have an inertial force, which is a centrifugal force, which is equal to <i>V_Circ square divided by r</i>.
So if you equal the centrifugal force to the gravitational force, you find that <i>V_Circ</i> is equal to square root of <i>Î¼ / r</i>.
This is another form of the gravitational well, in terms of the transfer velocity, so it's somewhat different from what we saw before.
The definition of the transfer velocity is the following: it's the velocity that you have to add to the circular velocity of any planet in the solar system, in order to have that planet - that's, of course, a thought experiment - leave the solar system and go to infinity, away from the Sun at a zero velocity.
So, these wings of that new form of the gravitational well represent the transfer velocity for every distance to the Sun, typically for Mars, you see that the transfer velocity is a little bit less than 10 km/s.
For Mercury it's of the order of 20 km/s.
So, from the orbit of Mercury you have to add, in the proper direction, the direction of the velocity vector of Mercury around the Sun, you have to add about 20 km/s in order for an object to leave the solar system and go to infinity from the Sun at a zero velocity.
In addition, on this graph we have a representation of the escape velocity for each of the planets.
Typically, for the Earth you have this icicle that has an amplitude of about 11.2 km/s.
You see that the icicle, respectively: the escape velocity from Jupiter is very, very large; the one from Mercury is very small.
And this is an interesting graph because it shows that from the surface of the planet, in order to escape the solar system you have, first of all, to give the escape velocity so that you leave the gravitational influence of the planet itself, and in addition you have to give a transfer velocity, in the proper direction, of the direction of the velocity vector of that planet around the Sun, in order to escape the solar system.
Here we've an example of the preceding graph.
The escape velocity out of the solar system from Mercury's orbit is about 68 km/s, but Mercury itself has an average, it has somewhat of an elliptical orbit, but average orbital velocity of 48 km/s, so the transfer velocity out of the solar system from Mercury's orbit is the difference between the two, which is 20 km/s.
Now, the escape velocity from that very, very small planet, Mercury, is only 3.5 km/s, so in order from the surface of Mercury to escape the solar system in this two-step process, you have to add the two, 20 km/s plus 3.5 which gives you 23.5 km/s.
Now, there is a somewhat more efficient way to do this exercise from the surface of Mercury: you can give one kick, instead of the two-step approach.
One kick, and it's a little more efficient.
You'll find a somewhat smaller value than the 23.5, but this is at least one way to escape the solar system from the surface of Mercury.
Now, it happened that escape velocity versus direction of escape, whatever direction you choose from a distance, a position of the distance <i>r</i> from the center of the Earth, whatever direction you choose, if you have the escape velocity you are going to infinity with a zero velocity.
You can do it straight up.
If you're at this point, very close to the surface of the Earth, and you shoot a bullet upwards with 11.2 km/s, which is about here, then you're going to escape the gravitational influence of the Earth and go to infinity at zero velocity.
You can also do it horizontally, and you'll come on this parabolic trajectory, and you're also going to reach infinity after a very long time at zero velocity.
That's, again, a principle.
It's not something you could do practically.
If you have a somewhat larger velocity than 11.2 then you come on a hyperbolic orbit, and we'll talk about these orbits later.
If you have less than 11.2 km/s, like 10 km/s, you come on an elliptical orbit.
So, again, whatever the direction of escape from a distance <i>r</i> to the center of the Earth, if you have the escape velocity you are eventually going to get to infinity or to a large distance, at a zero velocity.
