1
00:00:06,073 --> 00:00:10,423
Let's come back to the concept
of gravitational well

2
00:00:10,423 --> 00:00:13,801
and we are going to consider
the following situation.

3
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:17,085
We tried to take a unit map
from the surface of the Earth

4
00:00:17,085 --> 00:00:19,363
all the way to infinity here

5
00:00:19,363 --> 00:00:25,217
and we are interested in the work
needed to perform this action

6
00:00:25,217 --> 00:00:28,929
so again, unit mass taken
from the surface of the Earth to infinity

7
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:33,654
so it's obviously the integral between <i>R</i>,
the radius of the Earth, and infinity,

8
00:00:33,654 --> 00:00:36,765
<i>Âµ</i> divided by <i>r&sup2; dr</i>

9
00:00:36,765 --> 00:00:39,682
and interestingly enough,
it's a very simple integral.

10
00:00:39,682 --> 00:00:41,870
We find that it's equal to <i>g_0</i>,

11
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,459
the gravitational acceleration
at the surface of the Earth,

12
00:00:44,459 --> 00:00:47,532
times the radius of the Earth,

13
00:00:48,717 --> 00:00:52,259
<i>W_R</i> is the work from the surface
of the Earth to infinity

14
00:00:52,259 --> 00:00:55,704
is equal to <i>g_0</i> times <i>R</i>,
the radius of the Earth.

15
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:03,792
This work is equivalent to the one
that is necessary to lift a unit mass

16
00:01:03,792 --> 00:01:07,977
from the surface of the Earth
to a distance <i>R</i>,

17
00:01:08,957 --> 00:01:11,481
a distance equal
to the radius of the Earth,

18
00:01:11,481 --> 00:01:15,379
from the surface of the Earth
with a constant gravitational acceleration,

19
00:01:15,379 --> 00:01:16,822
which is <i>g_0</i>.

20
00:01:16,822 --> 00:01:20,945
So we say that the depth
of the Earth's gravitational well

21
00:01:20,945 --> 00:01:23,006
is equal to the radius of the Earth.

22
00:01:23,006 --> 00:01:27,330
Now if we start, not from 
the surface of the Earth,

23
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:31,670
but from a distance <i>r</i>
larger than the radius of the Earth

24
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,956
and we tried to do the same experiment,

25
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:36,906
lift that unit mass from that distance

26
00:01:36,906 --> 00:01:39,620
from the center of the Earth to infinity,

27
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:43,541
we find that this work
is equal to the work we had

28
00:01:44,571 --> 00:01:46,695
to do it from the surface of the Earth,

29
00:01:46,695 --> 00:01:48,363
but divided by <i>R</i>,

30
00:01:48,363 --> 00:01:53,877
so it's the work <i>W_R</i> 
from the surface of the Earth

31
00:01:53,877 --> 00:01:57,608
multiplied by the ratio
of the radius of the Earth divided by <i>r</i>.

32
00:01:57,608 --> 00:02:00,643
So, the profile of the gravitational well

33
00:02:01,563 --> 00:02:03,993
is going to be <i>1/r</i>

34
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:06,778
but the main thing,
which is very important to remember,

35
00:02:06,778 --> 00:02:08,969
is the depth of the gravitational well
of the Earth

36
00:02:08,969 --> 00:02:11,116
is equal to the radius
of the Earth itself.

37
00:02:12,588 --> 00:02:15,064
Now, you have a representation

38
00:02:15,064 --> 00:02:18,323
of that gravitational well
of planet Earth.

39
00:02:18,323 --> 00:02:22,055
What is important is the depth
of the gravitational well

40
00:02:22,055 --> 00:02:25,018
equal to the radius of the Earth itself

41
00:02:25,018 --> 00:02:30,394
and the wings of that well
are a profile in <i>1/R</i>

42
00:02:31,906 --> 00:02:36,794
If you take the case of the Moon,
the unnormalized -

43
00:02:36,794 --> 00:02:40,082
if I can say - depth
of the gravitational well of the Moon

44
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:41,875
is equal to the radius of the Moon.

45
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:44,139
This is exactly the same situation
as on the Earth

46
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:49,506
but of course, you have here a situation

47
00:02:49,506 --> 00:02:53,212
where this work needed
to bring your unit mass

48
00:02:53,212 --> 00:02:55,098
from the surface of the Moon to infinity

49
00:02:55,098 --> 00:03:00,367
is equal to the work done
to take that unit mass

50
00:03:00,367 --> 00:03:02,886
from the surface of the Moon

51
00:03:03,682 --> 00:03:07,250
to the radius of the Moon away
from the Moon's surface

52
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,675
but that the gravitational acceleration,

53
00:03:08,675 --> 00:03:11,957
which is only 1/6 of the value
that you have on Earth

54
00:03:11,957 --> 00:03:16,642
so if you want to normalize the depth
of the gravitational well of the Moon

55
00:03:16,642 --> 00:03:21,445
to the Earth values, you have
to divide that radius of the Moon

56
00:03:21,445 --> 00:03:24,503
or depth of the gravitational well
of the Moon by six.

57
00:03:25,124 --> 00:03:28,561
So it will give you only a value
of about 290 kilometers.

58
00:03:29,276 --> 00:03:33,035
What is important is that you always normalize
the depth of the gravitational well

59
00:03:33,035 --> 00:03:36,772
of any objects in the solar system
or elsewhere,

60
00:03:37,722 --> 00:03:40,371
spherical objects: this is only valid
for a spherical object.

61
00:03:40,724 --> 00:03:44,354
You have to normalize to the
gravitational acceleration of the Earth,

62
00:03:44,354 --> 00:03:48,658
which means that you have to divide
the radius of that spherical object

63
00:03:48,658 --> 00:03:51,961
by the ratio of the gravitational acceleration
of the surface of that object

64
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:54,960
divided by the gravitational acceleration
of the Earth, <i>g_0</i>.

65
00:03:56,078 --> 00:03:59,165
This is a depiction of what I said before:

66
00:03:59,165 --> 00:04:00,669
the depth of the gravitational well
of the Earth

67
00:04:00,669 --> 00:04:02,701
is equal to the radius
of the Earth itself,

68
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:06,570
and the profile is a profile in 1/<i>R</i>

69
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:09,959
Now, at the same scale,
we know that the Moon has a size

70
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,242
of about one quarter
the size of the Earth.

71
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:17,367
This is the non-normalized depth
of the gravitational well of the Moon

72
00:04:17,367 --> 00:04:19,394
which is equal to the radius of the Moon,

73
00:04:19,394 --> 00:04:22,263
but if you want to normalize
to the Earth's conditions,

74
00:04:22,263 --> 00:04:25,534
you have to multiply this by 1/6,
which is the ratio

75
00:04:25,534 --> 00:04:28,074
of the gravitational acceleration
at the surface of the Moon

76
00:04:28,074 --> 00:04:29,442
versus on the Earth.

77
00:04:29,442 --> 00:04:33,692
So it would only give you
a depth of about 287 kilometers.

78
00:04:34,244 --> 00:04:37,292
This is the value of this concept
of gravitational well.

79
00:04:37,292 --> 00:04:41,446
You realize that 
for the Earth's conditions

80
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:44,666
you have that depth
equal to the radius of the Earth,

81
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:48,012
6,367 kilometers

82
00:04:48,012 --> 00:04:50,908
and compared to that,
the gravitational well of the Moon,

83
00:04:50,908 --> 00:04:54,859
normalized, is only 287 kilometers.

84
00:04:54,859 --> 00:05:00,438
You realize how much easier it is
to come out of the gravitational influence

85
00:05:00,438 --> 00:05:03,245
of the Moon compared to the Earth.

86
00:05:03,245 --> 00:05:05,416
And now if you take a very small object
like an asteroid

87
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:08,831
or the nucleus of a comet,
you may have a gravitational well,

88
00:05:08,831 --> 00:05:12,943
normalized, again, being equal
to one meter or even a few centimeters

89
00:05:12,943 --> 00:05:15,673
if you have a very low
gravitational acceleration

90
00:05:15,673 --> 00:05:17,322
on the surface of that small object.

91
00:05:18,254 --> 00:05:21,858
Now, this is the normalized
profile of gravitational well.

92
00:05:21,858 --> 00:05:24,721
We have a unit of distance
which is different

93
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:27,783
on the horizontal axis
and the vertical axis,

94
00:05:27,783 --> 00:05:32,378
but you see the depiction
of the gravitational well of the Earth

95
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:35,344
with a profile of <i>1/R</i>

96
00:05:35,344 --> 00:05:39,405
and at the same scale you have
the normalized gravitational well

97
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:43,255
of the Moon, again, very small
compared to the one of the Earth.
