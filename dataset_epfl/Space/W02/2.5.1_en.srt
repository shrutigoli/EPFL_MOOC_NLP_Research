1
00:00:06,038 --> 00:00:07,383
Reference Frames:

2
00:00:07,383 --> 00:00:11,284
all of the orbits and orbital motions
that we'll talk about from now on

3
00:00:11,284 --> 00:00:14,629
will be always with respect
to a certain reference frame,

4
00:00:14,629 --> 00:00:17,399
but we'll describe
these reference frames here.

5
00:00:17,695 --> 00:00:21,916
First of all, that's one
that is pretty classic and well-known.

6
00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:24,814
It's the geographic coordinate system.

7
00:00:27,418 --> 00:00:29,953
You have the Meridian of Greenwich here

8
00:00:30,308 --> 00:00:34,725
and you have a North latitude
going towards the North Pole

9
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:37,720
and the South latitude
going toward the South Pole

10
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:43,203
and there's the East longitude
and the West longitude here,

11
00:00:43,331 --> 00:00:44,843
so this is well known;

12
00:00:44,843 --> 00:00:47,596
this is not really for describing orbits

13
00:00:47,596 --> 00:00:49,729
but positions on the surface
of planet Earth.

14
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,774
This is a fundamental coordinate system.

15
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,885
First of all, it's
an inertial coordinate system.

16
00:00:55,885 --> 00:00:59,287
Again, all of the motion
that we have talked about so far,

17
00:00:59,287 --> 00:01:00,672
that we'll talk about later,

18
00:01:00,672 --> 00:01:03,953
are always with respect to inertial frame.

19
00:01:03,953 --> 00:01:07,784
Again, inertial frame
is the frame of reference XYZ,

20
00:01:07,784 --> 00:01:10,114
all perpendicular
to each other, orthogonal,

21
00:01:10,504 --> 00:01:14,297
with respect to which the laws of motion,
the laws of Newton, are valid.

22
00:01:15,322 --> 00:01:18,670
Now, for the geocentric
inertial coordinate system

23
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:21,572
the center of the coordinate system
is the center of the Earth.

24
00:01:21,572 --> 00:01:25,141
The plane of reference,
and it's important to always consider

25
00:01:25,141 --> 00:01:28,307
for each reference frame,
a plane of reference.

26
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:32,334
The plane of reference in our case
is the plane of the Equator

27
00:01:32,334 --> 00:01:37,053
and we have X and Y
of this orthogonal coordinate system.

28
00:01:37,053 --> 00:01:40,686
In the plane of reference,
the direction of X

29
00:01:40,686 --> 00:01:42,946
is the direction of the vernal equinox.

30
00:01:42,946 --> 00:01:45,712
This is a point on the Equator
that the Sun is crossing

31
00:01:45,712 --> 00:01:49,331
when it goes from 
the southern celestial hemisphere

32
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:51,476
to the northern celestial hemisphere.

33
00:01:51,548 --> 00:01:53,895
It's a point crossed
around the 21st of March.

34
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:57,810
It just happens, and we'll talk
about this in a few minutes,

35
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,251
that this point is very slowly
migrating to the west

36
00:02:04,251 --> 00:02:09,213
so when we'll talk about
geocentric-inertial coordinate system,

37
00:02:09,213 --> 00:02:12,207
we have to specify
which year we are talking about.

38
00:02:12,207 --> 00:02:14,884
Normally it's the year 2000
that we use now.

39
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:17,680
Now, the Y axis
is perpendicular to X, of course,

40
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,027
and is also in the reference plane,
which is the Equator,

41
00:02:20,027 --> 00:02:25,459
and the Z axis is perpendicular to X and Y
and to the North Pole.

42
00:02:27,017 --> 00:02:29,302
The heliocentric-inertial coordinate system

43
00:02:29,302 --> 00:02:33,261
has the same directions of axes
as the one we talked about before,

44
00:02:33,261 --> 00:02:35,561
the geocentric-inertial coordinate system.

45
00:02:35,561 --> 00:02:39,493
The only difference is
that the center of the coordinate system

46
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,789
is in the center of the Sun.

47
00:02:41,789 --> 00:02:44,883
Again, the axes are perpendicular

48
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:49,481
to the ones of the geocentric-inertial
coordinate system

49
00:02:49,481 --> 00:02:52,953
with the X directed
to the vernal equinox for the year 2000.

50
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:55,178
Precession of the equinoxes.

51
00:02:55,178 --> 00:02:57,269
Now, it happens
that the Earth's rotational axis,

52
00:02:57,269 --> 00:02:59,582
which has a tilt of 23 and a half degrees

53
00:02:59,582 --> 00:03:02,123
with respect to a perpendicular
to the ecliptic plane,

54
00:03:02,646 --> 00:03:06,640
doesn't have a constant direction,
but it slowly precesses,

55
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,845
and it moves its direction in the sky.

56
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:13,224
This is due to the fact that the Earth
is not a perfect sphere,

57
00:03:13,224 --> 00:03:15,295
but it has an equatorial bulge,

58
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:20,273
and the gravitational forces,
from the Sun and the Moon also,

59
00:03:20,273 --> 00:03:23,781
on a non-spherical body,
causes this precession.

60
00:03:25,018 --> 00:03:28,745
Now, it means that the X direction

61
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:31,124
of the geocentric-inertial coordinate system

62
00:03:31,124 --> 00:03:33,858
and also the heliocentric-inertial
coordinate system

63
00:03:33,858 --> 00:03:37,924
varies slowly in direction with time
going to the west.

64
00:03:37,924 --> 00:03:43,745
It takes 26,000 years
for the Earth's rotational axis

65
00:03:43,745 --> 00:03:47,060
to go through a full rotation on this cone

66
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,212
around the North Pole
of the ecliptic plane.

67
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:56,522
Very slow motion, but it means
that we have to specify clearly

68
00:03:56,522 --> 00:03:59,344
when we use 
these inertial coordinate systems

69
00:03:59,344 --> 00:04:01,278
which year we are talking about,

70
00:04:01,278 --> 00:04:03,575
because the X direction
changes slowly with time.

71
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:08,953
On this slide we have a visual expression
of the precession of the Earth's axis

72
00:04:08,953 --> 00:04:11,260
on the celestial sphere.

73
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,140
We are now here.

74
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,088
This is the direction
of the South Celestial Pole.

75
00:04:17,088 --> 00:04:21,404
It's slowly migrating
with respect to the stars

76
00:04:21,404 --> 00:04:25,359
in the clockwise direction
in the Southern hemisphere.

77
00:04:25,359 --> 00:04:31,804
We'll come back to this point, point 2000,
in about 26,000 years from now.

78
00:04:31,804 --> 00:04:36,916
If we look at what happens
in the north, we are now here

79
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:40,160
and we see clearly that we have a star

80
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,836
very close to the direction
of the North Celestial Pole

81
00:04:44,836 --> 00:04:48,830
and in this case, we go counterclockwise

82
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:53,889
and the Celestial North Pole will move
with respect to the star in 26,000 years,

83
00:04:53,889 --> 00:04:57,171
all the way around and will come back
to the point on the top.
