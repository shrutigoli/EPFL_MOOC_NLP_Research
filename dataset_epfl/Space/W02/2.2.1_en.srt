00:00:05,575 --> 00:00:09,789
This is a review
of Newton's law of gravitation.

2
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:14,509
If you look at this picture,
you have the Earth with a radius <i>R</i>,

3
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:18,586
and we look at force of gravitation
at a distance <i>r</i>

4
00:00:18,586 --> 00:00:20,358
from the center of the Earth,

5
00:00:20,358 --> 00:00:23,693
is <i>F vectorial r</i>,

6
00:00:23,693 --> 00:00:27,272
and the value of <i>F_r</i> is equal to -

7
00:00:27,272 --> 00:00:31,377
we designate the gravitational
acceleration at that distance <i>r</i>

8
00:00:31,377 --> 00:00:35,891
from the center of the Earth as <i>g_r</i> -

9
00:00:36,671 --> 00:00:40,781
and the force is <i>g_r</i>
times the mass of the object.

10
00:00:42,113 --> 00:00:44,915
<i>g_r</i> is equal to <i>μ / r²</i>.

11
00:00:44,915 --> 00:00:48,086
In the course we always use,

12
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:53,059
or very often use <i>μ = G M</i> , <i>G</i> 
the constant of gravitation,

13
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:55,379
<i>M</i> the mass 
of the central object here, the Earth.

14
00:00:55,887 --> 00:00:59,398
Now, if we look at the situation
at the distance <i>R</i>

15
00:00:59,398 --> 00:01:01,845
from the center of the Earth,
on the surface of the Earth,

16
00:01:01,845 --> 00:01:06,825
then we have the force
of gravitation equals <i>g_0 times m</i>.

17
00:01:06,825 --> 00:01:10,514
The <i>g_0</i> is a gravitational acceleration
on the surface of the Earth,

18
00:01:10,514 --> 00:01:13,588
and we very often use simply the term <i>g</i>.

19
00:01:14,067 --> 00:01:18,343
<i>g</i> is equal to 9.81 m / sec².

20
00:01:19,278 --> 00:01:20,982
The gravitational profile.

21
00:01:21,241 --> 00:01:24,151
Inside the Earth and outside the Earth
we are interested to see

22
00:01:24,151 --> 00:01:28,151
what gravitational acceleration,
and what force we have

23
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:30,276
on a unit mass inside the Earth.

24
00:01:30,276 --> 00:01:34,134
We have to imagine a cavity
at a certain distance <i>r</i>

25
00:01:34,134 --> 00:01:35,375
from the center of the Earth,

26
00:01:35,375 --> 00:01:39,593
and you wonder what would be
the gravitational acceleration

27
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:41,842
at this point on this cavity.

28
00:01:41,842 --> 00:01:45,146
It just happens - and you can make
the calculation yourself -

29
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,083
that everything is so

30
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:52,506
that only the part of the mass
of the Earth

31
00:01:52,506 --> 00:01:57,251
considered a homogeneous object
which is inside that cavity,

32
00:01:57,251 --> 00:02:01,540
or the total sphere
that has a radius of <i>r</i>,

33
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:05,357
<i>r</i> being the distance between this cavity
and the center of the Earth,

34
00:02:05,357 --> 00:02:09,689
that's the only part that has
a gravitational effect

35
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:11,657
on any object in this cavity.

36
00:02:11,657 --> 00:02:15,951
The shell, which is outside
between the radius <i>r</i>,

37
00:02:15,951 --> 00:02:18,240
distance to the center
of the Earth of this cavity,

38
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:21,760
and <i>R</i> which is the radius of the Earth,

39
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,659
that shell has a null influence,
gravitationally,

40
00:02:25,659 --> 00:02:28,554
on any object located in this cavity.

41
00:02:28,554 --> 00:02:34,601
And as the mass of the portion
of the Earth inside that cavity,

42
00:02:34,601 --> 00:02:39,168
that sphere inside the cavity
is proportional to <i>r³</i>,

43
00:02:39,168 --> 00:02:45,034
and then the gravitational acceleration
is proportional to <i>R / r²</i>,

44
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:48,481
then <i>r³ / r²</i> gives you <i>r</i>.

45
00:02:48,481 --> 00:02:52,591
So the gravitational acceleration
inside such a cavity,

46
00:02:53,142 --> 00:02:56,352
inside the planet Earth,
is going to be linear

47
00:02:56,352 --> 00:02:58,036
with the distance to the Earth.

48
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:01,607
It starts at zero,
and is slowly increasing linearly

49
00:03:01,607 --> 00:03:05,517
to the value of 9.81 m/sec²,

50
00:03:05,517 --> 00:03:09,036
which is the gravitational acceleration
on the surface of the Earth.

51
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:13,222
Beyond that point, obviously,
we have a decrease in <i>1 / r²</i>

52
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:15,240
all the way to infinity.

53
00:03:15,717 --> 00:03:19,191
We have here the gravitational figures
for bodies in the solar system.

54
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:22,624
If we look at the Earth,
which is obviously of interest,

55
00:03:22,624 --> 00:03:26,650
we have the time to fall 4.9 m,

56
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:30,584
this is one half of 9.81,

57
00:03:30,584 --> 00:03:33,596
is going to be 1 second for the Earth.

58
00:03:33,596 --> 00:03:36,293
Obviously the gravity equal to 1.

59
00:03:36,293 --> 00:03:41,101
This is gravity in terms of <i>g_0</i>

60
00:03:41,668 --> 00:03:44,706
The escape velocity 11.2 km/s.

61
00:03:44,706 --> 00:03:46,991
This is valid for the surface
of the Earth.

62
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:51,738
Obviously, if you want to escape
the gravitational effect of the Earth

63
00:03:51,738 --> 00:03:54,891
from a distance <i>r</i>
from the center of the Earth

64
00:03:54,891 --> 00:03:57,017
which is larger
than the radius of the Earth,

65
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,335
this value will decrease.

66
00:03:58,335 --> 00:04:04,549
In fact, the escape velocity
is the square root of <i>2 μ / r</i>

67
00:04:04,549 --> 00:04:08,195
so it varies as 1 divided
by the square root of <i>r</i>

68
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:11,668
as you go away
from the surface of the Earth.

69
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,900
Now, the circular velocities
on the surface of the Earth,

70
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,091
which is of course not possible
because of the atmosphere,

71
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:22,195
but if you had no atmosphere
you would have about 7.9 km/s,

72
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:25,061
and this is square root of <i>μ / r</i>.

73
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:28,580
The escape velocity is always
equal to the square root

74
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:31,886
of two times the circular velocity
for a given distance

75
00:04:31,886 --> 00:04:34,897
to the center of the attracting object.

76
00:04:35,907 --> 00:04:38,834
If we look at values
for the Sun, for instance,

77
00:04:38,834 --> 00:04:43,658
obviously we have a very large
escape velocity of 618 km/s.

78
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:47,674
We have quite a large value
for Jupiter, also, 60 km/s,

79
00:04:47,674 --> 00:04:50,446
because the large mass
of the planet Jupiter

80
00:04:50,446 --> 00:04:54,198
and the large acceleration
on the surface,

81
00:04:54,198 --> 00:04:57,179
gravitational acceleration
on the surface of planet Jupiter.

82
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:00,244
In the next section
we'll look to more details

83
00:05:00,244 --> 00:05:01,983
of the concept of the gravitational well.

84
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:04,996
The gravitational well
basically is a conceptual model

85
00:05:04,996 --> 00:05:08,146
of the gravitational field
surrounding a body in space.

86
00:05:08,146 --> 00:05:10,156
And what will be especially interesting,

87
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:12,347
and we'll determine that 
in the next section,

88
00:05:12,347 --> 00:05:14,629
will be the depth
of the gravitational well.

89
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:17,844
Entering space
from the surface of a planet

90
00:05:17,844 --> 00:05:20,986
means climbing
out of the gravity well,

91
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:23,350
and the deeper a planet gravity well is,

92
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:25,781
the more energy it takes
to escape from it.

93
00:05:25,781 --> 00:05:28,516
So we'll look at this in detail
in the next section.
