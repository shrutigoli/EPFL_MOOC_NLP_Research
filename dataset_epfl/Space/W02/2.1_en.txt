Hello everyone. Welcome to Unit 2,
Introduction to Orbital Mechanics.
This week, we'll talk about 2.2
Concepts of gravitational well and dynamics of space flight;
2.3 Orbital motion and Keppler's laws;
2.4 The case of circular and elliptical orbits;
2.5 Reference frames.
We have prepared some practice quizzes after each video, to make sure that you have understood the concepts explained in these videos.
Each section, from 2.2 to 2.5, is concluded by a control quiz.
In addition, there is a test at the end of this unit.
To illustrate the unit, we have prepared a focus on Rosetta, with an interview of Andrea Accomazzo,
Head of Solar and Planetary
Missions Division, and previously,
Rosetta Flight Director at ESA.
Looking at this is facultative, but we encourage you to watch the interview in order to deepen your knowledge about this particular subject.
