Let's come back to the concept of gravitational well and we are going to consider the following situation.
We tried to take a unit map from the surface of the Earth all the way to infinity here and we are interested in the work needed to perform this action so again, unit mass taken from the surface of the Earth to infinity so it's obviously the integral between <i>R</i>, the radius of the Earth, and infinity,
<i>Âµ</i> divided by <i>r&sup2; dr</i> and interestingly enough, it's a very simple integral.
We find that it's equal to <i>g_0</i>, the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Earth, times the radius of the Earth,
<i>W_R</i> is the work from the surface of the Earth to infinity is equal to <i>g_0</i> times <i>R</i>, the radius of the Earth.
This work is equivalent to the one that is necessary to lift a unit mass from the surface of the Earth to a distance <i>R</i>, a distance equal to the radius of the Earth, from the surface of the Earth with a constant gravitational acceleration, which is <i>g_0</i>.
So we say that the depth of the Earth's gravitational well is equal to the radius of the Earth.
Now if we start, not from the surface of the Earth, but from a distance <i>r</i> larger than the radius of the Earth and we tried to do the same experiment, lift that unit mass from that distance from the center of the Earth to infinity, we find that this work is equal to the work we had to do it from the surface of the Earth, but divided by <i>R</i>, so it's the work <i>W_R</i> from the surface of the Earth multiplied by the ratio of the radius of the Earth divided by <i>r</i>.
So, the profile of the gravitational well is going to be <i>1/r</i> but the main thing, which is very important to remember, is the depth of the gravitational well of the Earth is equal to the radius of the Earth itself.
Now, you have a representation of that gravitational well of planet Earth.
What is important is the depth of the gravitational well equal to the radius of the Earth itself and the wings of that well are a profile in <i>1/R</i>
If you take the case of the Moon, the unnormalized - if I can say - depth of the gravitational well of the Moon is equal to the radius of the Moon.
This is exactly the same situation as on the Earth but of course, you have here a situation where this work needed to bring your unit mass from the surface of the Moon to infinity is equal to the work done to take that unit mass from the surface of the Moon to the radius of the Moon away from the Moon's surface but that the gravitational acceleration, which is only 1/6 of the value that you have on Earth so if you want to normalize the depth of the gravitational well of the Moon to the Earth values, you have to divide that radius of the Moon or depth of the gravitational well of the Moon by six.
So it will give you only a value of about 290 kilometers.
What is important is that you always normalize the depth of the gravitational well of any objects in the solar system or elsewhere, spherical objects: this is only valid for a spherical object.
You have to normalize to the gravitational acceleration of the Earth, which means that you have to divide the radius of that spherical object by the ratio of the gravitational acceleration of the surface of that object divided by the gravitational acceleration of the Earth, <i>g_0</i>.
This is a depiction of what I said before: the depth of the gravitational well of the Earth is equal to the radius of the Earth itself, and the profile is a profile in 1/<i>R</i>
Now, at the same scale, we know that the Moon has a size of about one quarter the size of the Earth.
This is the non-normalized depth of the gravitational well of the Moon which is equal to the radius of the Moon, but if you want to normalize to the Earth's conditions, you have to multiply this by 1/6, which is the ratio of the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Moon versus on the Earth.
So it would only give you a depth of about 287 kilometers.
This is the value of this concept of gravitational well.
You realize that for the Earth's conditions you have that depth equal to the radius of the Earth,
6,367 kilometers and compared to that, the gravitational well of the Moon, normalized, is only 287 kilometers.
You realize how much easier it is to come out of the gravitational influence of the Moon compared to the Earth.
And now if you take a very small object like an asteroid or the nucleus of a comet, you may have a gravitational well, normalized, again, being equal to one meter or even a few centimeters if you have a very low gravitational acceleration on the surface of that small object.
Now, this is the normalized profile of gravitational well.
We have a unit of distance which is different on the horizontal axis and the vertical axis, but you see the depiction of the gravitational well of the Earth with a profile of <i>1/R</i> and at the same scale you have the normalized gravitational well of the Moon, again, very small compared to the one of the Earth.
