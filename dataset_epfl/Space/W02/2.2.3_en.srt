1
00:00:05,702 --> 00:00:08,682
The question is now how to escape
from the Earth's gravitational influence.

2
00:00:08,682 --> 00:00:10,777
In fact, you can never completely escape

3
00:00:10,777 --> 00:00:12,422
the Earth's gravitational influence,

4
00:00:12,422 --> 00:00:14,272
because it goes to infinity,

5
00:00:14,272 --> 00:00:17,711
but of course it becomes
very rapidly extremely small.

6
00:00:17,925 --> 00:00:22,357
Basically, the idea of escaping
the Earth's gravitational influence

7
00:00:22,357 --> 00:00:24,922
is to bring a mass
from the vicinity of the Earth

8
00:00:24,922 --> 00:00:27,537
all the way to infinity
at a zero velocity.

9
00:00:27,537 --> 00:00:30,131
If you have a non-zero velocity
at large distance,

10
00:00:30,131 --> 00:00:32,550
or, let's say, at infinity, at the limit,

11
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:34,554
then you have done
more than what is needed

12
00:00:34,554 --> 00:00:37,720
to just escape the gravitational
influence of the Earth.

13
00:00:37,991 --> 00:00:40,099
Now, there's a slow method,
which is inefficient.

14
00:00:40,099 --> 00:00:44,868
Imagine that you have a rocket
that has a thrust-to-weight ratio

15
00:00:44,868 --> 00:00:46,772
which is just
a little bit larger than one.

16
00:00:46,772 --> 00:00:50,013
It will slowly move away 
from the launch pad,

17
00:00:50,013 --> 00:00:51,781
and it will not move very much,

18
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:55,961
and it will use a lot of propellant
for not going very far

19
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:58,125
at the limit, if you have exactly

20
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:00,427
a thrust equal
to the weight of the rocket.

21
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:02,399
With an adjustment of the thrust,

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,261
taken to account the fact
that you are using propellant,

23
00:01:05,261 --> 00:01:08,379
you are going to have
a rocket sitting there in mid air

24
00:01:08,379 --> 00:01:11,237
and going nowhere,
but using a lot of propellant.

25
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:16,228
So, the efficient method of escaping
the vicinity of the Earth,

26
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:19,283
and trying to go towards infinity
with a zero velocity,

27
00:01:19,283 --> 00:01:21,895
which, again, is the limit of escape

28
00:01:21,895 --> 00:01:23,946
of the Earth's gravitational influence,

29
00:01:23,946 --> 00:01:25,717
it's better to give a big kick.

30
00:01:27,741 --> 00:01:29,871
You could do it, of course,
with a big gun,

31
00:01:29,871 --> 00:01:34,026
and have a bullet moving vertically
at a certain velocity,

32
00:01:34,026 --> 00:01:36,858
and this is the so-called
<i>escape velocity</i>,

33
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:39,702
which is the velocity

34
00:01:39,702 --> 00:01:41,952
at which you have to leave
the surface of the Earth

35
00:01:41,952 --> 00:01:46,120
in order for your spacecraft,

36
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:47,630
which has been ejected in this way,

37
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:50,060
to go to infinity with a zero velocity.

38
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:55,331
Now, if you equal the work needed

39
00:01:55,331 --> 00:01:59,251
to bring a unit mass from the surface
of the Earth to infinity:

40
00:01:59,251 --> 00:02:03,910
we determined this is equal to <i>g_0 times R</i>-
the gravitational acceleration

41
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:06,241
of the surface of the Earth,
and the radius of the Earth -

42
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:11,788
if we equal this to kinetic energy, <i>½ V_Esc</i>,

43
00:02:11,788 --> 00:02:14,821
then you can determine the value of <i>V_Esc</i>,

44
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:18,963
and you find that it's equal
to the square root of <i>2 μ / R</i>.

45
00:02:18,963 --> 00:02:20,321
We saw that already before,

46
00:02:20,321 --> 00:02:23,471
but this is another way to determine
the value of the escape velocity

47
00:02:23,471 --> 00:02:25,456
from the surface of the Earth.

48
00:02:26,037 --> 00:02:28,438
You can do the same thing,
not from the surface of the Earth,

49
00:02:28,438 --> 00:02:33,808
but from a certain distance, <i>r</i>,
to the center of the Earth,

50
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:38,567
and you are going to find 
the kinetic energy,

51
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:41,919
if you equal this to the work needed
to bring a unit mass

52
00:02:41,919 --> 00:02:45,728
from that location here to infinity,

53
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:49,778
so we saw before that it's equal
to the gravitational acceleration

54
00:02:49,778 --> 00:02:52,544
at that distance
from the center of the Earth,

55
00:02:52,544 --> 00:02:56,855
times that distance, <i>r</i>,
to the center of the Earth.

56
00:02:56,855 --> 00:03:00,268
And, again, you can find
the escape velocity

57
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:05,627
for the value of <i>r</i>
to the center of the Earth

58
00:03:05,627 --> 00:03:08,382
is equal to the square root of <i>2 μ / r</i>.

59
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,358
So this is a general value
of the escape velocity

60
00:03:11,358 --> 00:03:15,252
for any distance <i>r</i>
to the center of the Earth.

61
00:03:16,104 --> 00:03:17,543
Let's look at circular velocity.

62
00:03:17,543 --> 00:03:21,237
Here you have the Space Shuttle
on a circular orbit,

63
00:03:21,789 --> 00:03:24,347
with a certain velocity, <i>V_Circ</i>,

64
00:03:24,347 --> 00:03:30,630
typically of the order
for Low Earth Orbit of 7.7—7.8 km/s,

65
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:33,738
or going around the Earth
in about an hour and a half.

66
00:03:34,044 --> 00:03:38,967
And you have, of course, a gravitational
force exercised on the Shuttle,

67
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:43,210
and we know its value for a distance <i>r</i>
to the center of the Earth,

68
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,533
and you have an inertial force,
which is a centrifugal force,

69
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,094
which is equal 
to <i>V_Circ square divided by r</i>.

70
00:03:51,586 --> 00:03:57,175
So if you equal the centrifugal force
to the gravitational force,

71
00:03:57,175 --> 00:04:01,393
you find that <i>V_Circ</i> is equal
to square root of <i>μ / r</i>.

72
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,726
This is another form
of the gravitational well,

73
00:04:04,726 --> 00:04:06,840
in terms of the transfer velocity,

74
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,409
so it's somewhat different
from what we saw before.

75
00:04:10,102 --> 00:04:12,479
The definition of the transfer velocity
is the following:

76
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,995
it's the velocity that you have
to add to the circular velocity

77
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:20,544
of any planet in the solar system,
in order to have that planet -

78
00:04:20,544 --> 00:04:23,716
that's, of course, a thought experiment -
leave the solar system

79
00:04:23,716 --> 00:04:27,432
and go to infinity, away from the Sun
at a zero velocity.

80
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:33,158
So, these wings of that new form
of the gravitational well

81
00:04:33,158 --> 00:04:39,371
represent the transfer velocity
for every distance to the Sun,

82
00:04:39,704 --> 00:04:41,188
typically for Mars,

83
00:04:41,371 --> 00:04:46,619
you see that the transfer velocity
is a little bit less than 10 km/s.

84
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:51,427
For Mercury it's of the order of 20 km/s.

85
00:04:51,427 --> 00:04:55,400
So, from the orbit of Mercury
you have to add, in the proper direction,

86
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,554
the direction of the velocity vector
of Mercury around the Sun,

87
00:04:58,554 --> 00:05:01,345
you have to add about 20 km/s

88
00:05:01,345 --> 00:05:04,269
in order for an object
to leave the solar system

89
00:05:04,269 --> 00:05:07,353
and go to infinity from the Sun
at a zero velocity.

90
00:05:07,828 --> 00:05:10,347
In addition, on this graph
we have a representation

91
00:05:10,347 --> 00:05:14,358
of the escape velocity
for each of the planets.

92
00:05:14,358 --> 00:05:17,765
Typically, for the Earth
you have this icicle

93
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:22,180
that has an amplitude 
of about 11.2 km/s.

94
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,234
You see that the icicle, respectively:

95
00:05:24,234 --> 00:05:28,910
the escape velocity
from Jupiter is very, very large;

96
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,047
the one from Mercury is very small.

97
00:05:31,047 --> 00:05:33,418
And this is an interesting graph
because it shows

98
00:05:33,418 --> 00:05:35,528
that from the surface of the planet,

99
00:05:35,528 --> 00:05:37,622
in order to escape the solar system

100
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:41,544
you have, first of all,
to give the escape velocity

101
00:05:41,544 --> 00:05:45,061
so that you leave the gravitational
influence of the planet itself,

102
00:05:45,061 --> 00:05:47,689
and in addition you have
to give a transfer velocity,

103
00:05:47,689 --> 00:05:51,943
in the proper direction,
of the direction of the velocity vector

104
00:05:51,943 --> 00:05:55,394
of that planet around the Sun,
in order to escape the solar system.

105
00:05:56,478 --> 00:06:00,166
Here we've an example
of the preceding graph.

106
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:02,954
The escape velocity
out of the solar system

107
00:06:02,954 --> 00:06:06,900
from Mercury's orbit is about 68 km/s,

108
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:11,583
but Mercury itself has an average,

109
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,226
it has somewhat of an elliptical orbit,

110
00:06:13,226 --> 00:06:17,007
but average orbital velocity of 48 km/s,

111
00:06:17,007 --> 00:06:22,022
so the transfer velocity out of
the solar system from Mercury's orbit

112
00:06:22,022 --> 00:06:25,724
is the difference between the two,
which is 20 km/s.

113
00:06:25,724 --> 00:06:29,947
Now, the escape velocity from
that very, very small planet, Mercury,

114
00:06:29,947 --> 00:06:34,227
is only 3.5 km/s, so in order
from the surface of Mercury

115
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,127
to escape the solar system
in this two-step process,

116
00:06:38,127 --> 00:06:41,367
you have to add
the two, 20 km/s plus 3.5

117
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,843
which gives you 23.5 km/s.

118
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:47,349
Now, there is a somewhat
more efficient way

119
00:06:47,349 --> 00:06:49,902
to do this exercise
from the surface of Mercury:

120
00:06:49,902 --> 00:06:53,091
you can give one kick,
instead of the two-step approach.

121
00:06:53,091 --> 00:06:55,325
One kick, and it's
a little more efficient.

122
00:06:55,325 --> 00:06:59,078
You'll find a somewhat
smaller value than the 23.5,

123
00:06:59,078 --> 00:07:02,280
but this is at least one way
to escape the solar system

124
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,945
from the surface of Mercury.

125
00:07:04,603 --> 00:07:09,117
Now, it happened that escape velocity
versus direction of escape,

126
00:07:09,577 --> 00:07:12,776
whatever direction you choose
from a distance,

127
00:07:13,701 --> 00:07:17,057
a position of the distance <i>r</i>
from the center of the Earth,

128
00:07:17,057 --> 00:07:20,306
whatever direction you choose,
if you have the escape velocity

129
00:07:20,306 --> 00:07:22,456
you are going to infinity
with a zero velocity.

130
00:07:22,466 --> 00:07:24,077
You can do it straight up.

131
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,687
If you're at this point,
very close to the surface of the Earth,

132
00:07:27,687 --> 00:07:30,574
and you shoot a bullet upwards

133
00:07:30,574 --> 00:07:33,914
with 11.2 km/s, which is about here,

134
00:07:33,914 --> 00:07:37,975
then you're going to escape
the gravitational influence of the Earth

135
00:07:37,975 --> 00:07:40,155
and go to infinity at zero velocity.

136
00:07:40,155 --> 00:07:42,319
You can also do it horizontally,

137
00:07:43,308 --> 00:07:47,033
and you'll come
on this parabolic trajectory,

138
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:49,577
and you're also going to reach infinity

139
00:07:49,577 --> 00:07:51,311
after a very long time at zero velocity.

140
00:07:51,311 --> 00:07:54,001
That's, again, a principle.

141
00:07:54,001 --> 00:07:56,217
It's not something
you could do practically.

142
00:07:56,374 --> 00:07:59,522
If you have a somewhat
larger velocity than 11.2

143
00:07:59,522 --> 00:08:01,438
then you come on a hyperbolic orbit,

144
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:04,202
and we'll talk about these orbits later.

145
00:08:04,202 --> 00:08:08,497
If you have less than 11.2 km/s,
like 10 km/s,

146
00:08:08,497 --> 00:08:10,713
you come on an elliptical orbit.

147
00:08:10,713 --> 00:08:14,298
So, again, whatever
the direction of escape

148
00:08:14,298 --> 00:08:18,425
from a distance <i>r</i>
to the center of the Earth,

149
00:08:18,425 --> 00:08:20,411
if you have the escape velocity

150
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:22,668
you are eventually
going to get to infinity

151
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,590
or to a large distance,
at a zero velocity.
