Today we'll look at orbital motion and Kepler's laws, which are fundamental laws related to the two-body problem and the motion typically of a satellite around the Earth, or the motion of a planet around the Sun.
Now, basically the two-body problem is to determine the motion of the two bodies that interact with each other.
We have some examples, like double stars, where the two masses, the stars, are relatively comparable.
We will not consider that; we'll only consider the case of a very small low-mass object around a massive object, typically a satellite around the Earth, or planets around the Sun.
Now we have the expression of the gravitational force, or Newton's law.
We have seen this a few times.
The gravitational force per unit mass is equal to <i>Î¼ / rÂ²</i>,
Î¼ equal to the gravitational constant <i>G</i> times the mass of the central body.
Now, the hypotheses that we have for the rest of the course will be that, unless otherwise noted, we'll consider that we only have the central body plus the spacecraft.
The mass of the spacecraft is much smaller than the mass of the central body, so that the center of mass of the two objects, in the two-body problem, will be at the center of the most massive body, typically the Earth or the Sun.
We consider that the bodies are spherical and homogeneous, and no perturbations.
By the way, of perturbations, we have some values here which are valid for a spacecraft on orbit around the Earth.
If we are on Low Earth Orbit, the gravitational acceleration is typically of the order of 0.9 of the gravitational acceleration at the surface of the Earth, but if we look at the value of the perturbation due to the Sun, <i>6 x 10^-4</i>, it's not completely negligible, but it still is small, and if we look at the influence of the Moon,
Jupiter, and Venus are very, very small values.
So the major perturbation, apart of course from the drag due to the residual atmosphere at the altitude of a Low Earth Orbit spacecraft, the major perturbation is due to the Sun.
Kepler's laws were established at the beginning of the 17th century by Kepler doing very careful observation of the motion of mass in the sky.
It was very remarkable to come to these three fundamental laws just on the basis of these visual observations with some instruments, but they were relatively primitive instruments, so quite an achievement by Kepler in the establishment of these three laws.
The first law is that the orbit of every planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci of the ellipse, and we have three examples here.
We have the inner ellipse, in the white color, with a relatively large eccentricity, so it's a stretched ellipse.
We have the blue ellipse, a little bit larger, always with the Sun at one of the focus of the ellipse, with a little less eccentricity than the first one, and the outer orbit is nearly a circular orbit.
So these are three examples of closed orbits: either ellipse with large or small eccentricity, or circle.
This is what Kepler established.
Now we have a generalization of the first law of Kepler, where the orbit, in the case of a two-body problem, the orbit of the small body versus the large body, is, generally speaking, a conic.
It's either an ellipse, with a special case of a circle, or a parabola or hyperbola.
So this is a generalization of the first law of Kepler: conic orbits around the Sun, or around every massive object.
Kepler's second law is a fundamental law.
It says that a line joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time.
If you consider what's happening close to the perihelion, we have the radius of vector <i>S</i> to <i>a</i>, and we have the elliptical motion, which is covered counterclockwise, so we go from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i>, and if we consider the surface of <i>S, a, b</i>, it has a certain value, then we go further away towards the aphelion, and we go from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>, further away from the Sun.
And if we have these two areas being equal then the time from <i>a</i> to <i>b</i> is going to be equal to the time from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>, which means that close to the perihelion we have a much higher orbital velocity than if we move away from the perihelion, and we have the minimum velocity when we are at a aphelion.
The third law of Kepler is expressing the relationship between the time of revolution of a planet around the Sun or of a satellite around the Earth as a function of the semi-major axis of the elliptical orbit.
Basically, we have the square of the time of revolution is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of the ellipse, which is the trajectory of that planet, or that space wrapped around the central body.
This is an animation summarizing the three laws of Kepler, at least the original version of the three laws of Kepler, with a closed orbit around the Sun.
We have two elliptical orbits, and we have one large circular obit.
So the first law of Kepler is illustrated here with the shape of these orbits, elliptical or circular, and of course in the general case we have any conic trajectory.
Typically, we can have a parabolic trajectory or hyperbolic trajectory, and we'll have this hyperbolic trajectory when we cover the case of interplanetary trajectories.
Within the sphere of influence of the Earth or the destination planet, we'll have hyperbolic orbits.
For the second law, we see clearly, especially for the small white elliptical orbit, that the velocity of the planet is much larger when it's close to the Sun.
Of course, we have no orbit in the solar system with so much eccentricity, but this is to illustrate the second law, which is a version of the conservation of angular momentum.
For the circular orbit, a large orbit, of course the velocity is constant, equal to the square root of <i>Î¼ / r</i>,
<i>r</i> being the distance to the Sun.
Now, for the third law we cannot see the numerical value of a <i>TÂ²</i> proportional to <i>aÂ³</i>, but we see that, obviously, for large orbits, the time of revolution of the planet around the sun is much larger than for small orbits.
