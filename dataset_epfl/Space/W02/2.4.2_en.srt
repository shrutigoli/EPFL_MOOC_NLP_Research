1
00:00:05,292 --> 00:00:09,126
Here we have a set of useful formulas,
or relationships,

2
00:00:09,151 --> 00:00:11,427
valid for elliptical orbits,

3
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:13,698
two slides, this one and the next one.

4
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:17,251
And these are expressions
that you can use in the future

5
00:00:17,252 --> 00:00:20,582
to do calculations
related to elliptical orbits.

6
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:26,240
On this slide, I would like
to point out in particular mean motion.

7
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:31,729
It's an important parameter,
it's in radians per second.

8
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:37,469
It's the average rate
of evolution of the radians

9
00:00:37,474 --> 00:00:39,574
on the elliptical orbit,

10
00:00:39,834 --> 00:00:43,335
equal to square root of <i>μ</i> over <i>a</i> cube.

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,300
In fact, the period
of the elliptical motion

12
00:00:49,626 --> 00:00:55,043
is equal to <i>2 π</i> radians
divided by the mean motion.

13
00:00:56,141 --> 00:01:00,461
So <i>2 π times square root of a cube over μ</i>,

14
00:01:01,042 --> 00:01:07,334
so the relationship between <i>T</i> and <i>n</i>

15
00:01:07,586 --> 00:01:10,436
is clearly expressed here also.

16
00:01:11,356 --> 00:01:13,335
All the other expressions you can use,

17
00:01:13,336 --> 00:01:16,750
again, relationship
between the eccentricity,

18
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:18,960
the semi-major axis,

19
00:01:19,756 --> 00:01:24,846
the distance to the apogee and perigee,

20
00:01:25,405 --> 00:01:28,195
again, useful expressions
to be used in the future.

21
00:01:28,734 --> 00:01:33,424
Here is another set of expressions
that will be used in the future.

22
00:01:34,209 --> 00:01:38,418
Now, there is one,
the time since periapsis,

23
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:40,804
that we'll be talking about later,

24
00:01:40,805 --> 00:01:43,958
it's the so-called  Kepler's equation.

25
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:49,168
It's a relationship between <i>E</i>,
which is the so-called eccentric anomaly,

26
00:01:49,191 --> 00:01:53,011
which is related
to the true anomaly in this way.

27
00:01:53,527 --> 00:01:57,772
And we'll have the definition
of the eccentric anomaly

28
00:01:57,773 --> 00:01:59,791
in the following slide.

29
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:04,422
But this is going to be
a very important expression

30
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:11,376
to see the time evolution
of the true anomaly, <i>θ</i> versus <i>T</i>,

31
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,718
and we have to go
via the eccentric anomaly,

32
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,970
which will be defined later.

33
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,190
Obviously, we have
this very important expression

34
00:02:20,203 --> 00:02:24,493
that we developed earlier,
the velocity in an elliptical orbit,

35
00:02:24,584 --> 00:02:27,709
<i>square root of 2 μ over r minus μ over a</i>

36
00:02:27,967 --> 00:02:31,767
and the expression of the conservation
of the angular momentum,

37
00:02:32,237 --> 00:02:37,757
on the perigee you have the largest speed:

38
00:02:37,758 --> 00:02:41,218
<i>r_p</i> is small, and <i>V_p</i> is large

39
00:02:41,535 --> 00:02:43,994
and is equal to the products

40
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:47,262
of the distance to the apogee
and the velocity at the apogee.

41
00:02:47,263 --> 00:02:51,834
This is of course an expression
of the second law of Kepler.

42
00:02:53,501 --> 00:02:57,412
Now, this is one example
of an utilization of the expression

43
00:02:57,413 --> 00:03:00,131
that we developed on the previous slide.

44
00:03:00,132 --> 00:03:04,312
You have, for instance, the determination
of <i>r</i>, the radius vector

45
00:03:04,322 --> 00:03:07,882
from the central body to the spacecraft

46
00:03:08,542 --> 00:03:12,064
knowing the semi-major axis, the eccentricity,

47
00:03:12,065 --> 00:03:14,884
and the value of the true anomaly <i>θ</i>,

48
00:03:14,885 --> 00:03:17,462
or knowing the distance
to the perigee <i>r_p</i>,

49
00:03:17,463 --> 00:03:20,032
the eccentricity, and the value of <i>θ</i>.

50
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:22,460
So you see the expression here

51
00:03:22,461 --> 00:03:26,210
and, again, you can derive
such expression

52
00:03:26,211 --> 00:03:28,550
from the preceding slides,

53
00:03:28,551 --> 00:03:32,231
where we have all these relationships
valid for elliptical orbits.

54
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:34,787
Another example,
and it's an interesting example

55
00:03:34,788 --> 00:03:38,988
where you can determine
all the parameters of an elliptical orbit

56
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:40,689
knowing two points of the orbit.

57
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,293
So you have <i>r_1</i>,
that's one point over there

58
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:49,456
with <i>θ_1</i> and <i>r_1</i>,

59
00:03:49,457 --> 00:03:53,466
and here is another point,
where you have <i>θ_2</i>,

60
00:03:53,467 --> 00:03:55,732
another true anomaly and the value of <i>r_2</i>.

61
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,802
And if you know these two points,

62
00:03:57,803 --> 00:04:00,798
you can, with this expression
that we had here,

63
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,626
determine the parameters of the orbit
and, again, and it's the eccentricity,

64
00:04:05,918 --> 00:04:11,016
and the distance to the perigee 
or the apogee, or the semi-major axis,

65
00:04:11,016 --> 00:04:13,834
and all these values can be determined

66
00:04:13,866 --> 00:04:16,266
using preceding expressions.

67
00:04:17,209 --> 00:04:19,000
Kepler’s equation, this is, again,

68
00:04:19,002 --> 00:04:24,751
a major achievement of Kepler
in the 17th century.

69
00:04:25,286 --> 00:04:27,996
All of the relationships
that we have seen so far,

70
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:32,504
are geometrical relationships
relating all the parameters of the orbit,

71
00:04:32,505 --> 00:04:35,481
but we have not had a time sequence

72
00:04:35,482 --> 00:04:41,152
of how the value of <i>r</i>,
the radius vector amplitude,

73
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:44,420
or <i>θ</i>, the true anomaly, evolve with time.

74
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:49,001
Kepler on the basis, again,
of his very precise observations

75
00:04:49,017 --> 00:04:52,496
of the motion of the planet Mars
in the 17th century

76
00:04:53,186 --> 00:04:59,009
determined this time evolution:

77
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,619
<i>E</i>, which is eccentric anomaly,

78
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:05,400
and we had the definition
of the eccentric anomaly here.

79
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:08,959
This is the angle
between the line of the apsides

80
00:05:09,149 --> 00:05:14,959
and this line here, this segment,
which is between the center of the ellipse

81
00:05:15,269 --> 00:05:18,786
and the intersection with the circle

82
00:05:18,787 --> 00:05:22,437
having the line of apsides as a diameter.

83
00:05:23,097 --> 00:05:27,437
You have this point here

84
00:05:28,574 --> 00:05:32,282
which is the intersection
of the perpendicular

85
00:05:32,283 --> 00:05:33,592
to the line of apsides

86
00:05:33,593 --> 00:05:36,713
going through the spacecraft
or the planet.

87
00:05:37,273 --> 00:05:39,545
So this is the definition of <i>E</i>,

88
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:44,240
and obviously, there is a relationship
between <i>E</i> and the true anomaly.

89
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:46,683
We have seen this in the preceding slide.

90
00:05:46,684 --> 00:05:51,917
So Kepler's equation,
which is a transcendental equation

91
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:54,192
you cannot solve it for <i>E</i>,

92
00:05:54,193 --> 00:05:57,703
you cannot have
an algebraic expression of <i>E</i> versus <i>t</i>.

93
00:05:58,603 --> 00:06:02,583
But it expresses the time evolution
of E, the eccentric anomaly,

94
00:06:03,534 --> 00:06:09,224
so you have also the time evolution
of θ, the true anomaly,

95
00:06:09,611 --> 00:06:14,035
and you can use other relationships
to have also the time evolution of <i>r</i>,

96
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:15,322
the length of the radius vector.

97
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:20,598
So you can solve the Kepler's equation
and have the whole time evolution

98
00:06:20,878 --> 00:06:24,978
of the motion of the spacecraft
or the planet on its orbit.

99
00:06:25,653 --> 00:06:27,857
It has to be solved
numerically, obviously,

100
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:29,917
it cannot be solved algebraically.

101
00:06:29,918 --> 00:06:31,698
It's a transcendental equation.
