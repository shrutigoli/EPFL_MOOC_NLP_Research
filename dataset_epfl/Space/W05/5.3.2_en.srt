1
00:00:05,723 --> 00:00:07,411
Let's talk about the alternative method

2
00:00:07,411 --> 00:00:10,333
to generate electrical power in space.

3
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:14,958
Although it has some limitation, 
we can only use this method

4
00:00:14,958 --> 00:00:18,649
if you have a magnetic field 
around the planet

5
00:00:18,649 --> 00:00:20,270
that you are going around.

6
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:23,554
In this case, for the Earth obviously, 
would be the case for Mars,

7
00:00:23,554 --> 00:00:25,840
would be the case for Jupiter, 
for instance.

8
00:00:26,343 --> 00:00:28,642
It's by the use of space tether.

9
00:00:29,547 --> 00:00:34,651
A tether is a cable and if you have 
a long cable in space

10
00:00:34,651 --> 00:00:37,662
with two objects at the end of this cable,

11
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:39,909
obviously as we have seen before,

12
00:00:39,909 --> 00:00:43,008
this cable will take an orientation 
such that it is

13
00:00:43,832 --> 00:00:46,684
oriented along the local vertical

14
00:00:46,684 --> 00:00:49,488
as it goes around the Earth-- 
let's take the case of the Earth--

15
00:00:49,488 --> 00:00:51,704
it will always stay on the local vertical.

16
00:00:52,483 --> 00:00:55,578
Now space tether applications 
have been studied

17
00:00:55,578 --> 00:01:01,266
by many space scientists, engineers, 
since Tsiolkovsky himself,

18
00:01:01,278 --> 00:01:04,307
the Russian who was of course 
a rocket scientist

19
00:01:04,457 --> 00:01:08,542
but he also talked about 
the possible use of space tethers

20
00:01:08,542 --> 00:01:12,629
for generating electricity or for the use
purely mechanically

21
00:01:12,629 --> 00:01:15,372
and we'll look at these applications

22
00:01:16,852 --> 00:01:19,251
now and in the next video also.

23
00:01:20,534 --> 00:01:22,552
Here you have a overall situation.

24
00:01:22,552 --> 00:01:24,124
You have the vertical space tether.

25
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,099
You have to remember that this tether

26
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:29,308
is in the ionosphere, 
so it's in a conductive medium,

27
00:01:29,513 --> 00:01:30,853
a very very tenuous medium

28
00:01:30,853 --> 00:01:35,155
but a medium that is basically 
made of ions and electrons

29
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:36,732
conducted medium.

30
00:01:36,732 --> 00:01:40,732
Now if you can collect electrons on top,

31
00:01:40,732 --> 00:01:43,755
these electrons because of induction--

32
00:01:43,755 --> 00:01:45,559
and we'll come back to that later--

33
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:49,865
because you are moving rapidly 
in the geomagnetic field,

34
00:01:49,865 --> 00:01:53,440
the induction will drive 
the electron downwards

35
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:56,196
in the lower body and to a certain degree

36
00:01:56,278 --> 00:01:58,351
you need to have an emitter 
of electrons here,

37
00:01:58,351 --> 00:02:01,814
depends on the ability

38
00:02:02,066 --> 00:02:05,651
of the lower spacecraft to generate 
electrons in the ionosphere.

39
00:02:05,651 --> 00:02:07,588
Most of the time, 
if you have an insulator,

40
00:02:07,588 --> 00:02:09,229
which is the case for the Space Shuttle,

41
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,324
obviously covered with all these 
thermal-protection tiles,

42
00:02:12,324 --> 00:02:16,343
which also were an electric insulator,

43
00:02:16,343 --> 00:02:18,662
you needed to have a emitter of electron.

44
00:02:18,662 --> 00:02:21,226
You reinject electrons in the ionosphere,

45
00:02:21,226 --> 00:02:23,522
somehow they come back to the top

46
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:25,693
and you can close the circuit in this way.

47
00:02:25,877 --> 00:02:29,922
So with the induction effect, 
you create kind of a battery in space

48
00:02:30,212 --> 00:02:33,500
with negative pole at the bottom 
and a positive pole at the top

49
00:02:33,706 --> 00:02:35,226
sucking electrons.

50
00:02:35,226 --> 00:02:37,070
These electrons go down the tether

51
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:39,344
then come back to the top 
and you close the circuit.

52
00:02:39,344 --> 00:02:43,410
So not only you generate voltage 
due to the induction

53
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,906
to the Faraday effect 
but you generate electrical power

54
00:02:46,071 --> 00:02:48,289
because you have a current 
in addition to the voltage.

55
00:02:49,215 --> 00:02:51,714
Now we have represented here

56
00:02:51,714 --> 00:02:55,177
the motion of the tether, 
which is to the left

57
00:02:55,177 --> 00:02:57,363
you have the geomagnetic field here.

58
00:02:58,046 --> 00:03:01,115
You have to realize that this system 
is going to work fine

59
00:03:01,115 --> 00:03:02,893
when you are relatively 
close to the equator

60
00:03:03,175 --> 00:03:05,735
with the magnetic field lines 
pretty much horizontal

61
00:03:05,735 --> 00:03:07,304
or close to the horizontal.

62
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:11,595
If you are in the vicinity
of the magnetic poles of the Earth

63
00:03:11,595 --> 00:03:15,792
with the B vector 
or the magnetic field vector

64
00:03:15,792 --> 00:03:18,169
close to the vertical, 
then it doesn't work anymore.

65
00:03:19,093 --> 00:03:25,079
Anyway, this method that can be used 
for many many different application.

66
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,221
Electrical power generation 
is obviously one application;

67
00:03:28,524 --> 00:03:31,824
orbital transfer, that's one purely 
mechanical application

68
00:03:31,824 --> 00:03:33,477
and we'll look at this later;

69
00:03:33,477 --> 00:03:35,422
study of of the ionosphere because again

70
00:03:35,422 --> 00:03:37,907
if you have this big battery 
in the ionosphere

71
00:03:37,907 --> 00:03:41,073
the kind of current that 
you can get out of the voltage

72
00:03:41,073 --> 00:03:44,837
would give you an indication 
about the conductivity of the ionosphere.

73
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,756
So some of the properties 
of the ionosphere can be studied.

74
00:03:49,073 --> 00:03:50,810
We can do variable gravity research

75
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:54,069
whenever you are away from 
the center of gravity of the system,

76
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:57,224
you have gravity that deviates 
from the micro-gravity.

77
00:03:57,224 --> 00:03:59,826
You could use this to your advantage
for science.

78
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:04,735
You can also provide with tethers 
artificial gravity

79
00:04:04,735 --> 00:04:06,595
for long journeys in the solar system.

80
00:04:06,595 --> 00:04:09,822
This is one concept 
for human flight to Mars,

81
00:04:09,822 --> 00:04:13,003
which could last up to six, seven, 
or eight months.

82
00:04:13,411 --> 00:04:16,113
In zero gravity would be hard, 
you get to the planet

83
00:04:16,113 --> 00:04:19,691
even though it's only one third G 
on the surface of Mars,

84
00:04:19,691 --> 00:04:23,443
you get there with a crew 
with no help at all

85
00:04:23,443 --> 00:04:27,053
and if there was a way to provide 
at least partial gravity

86
00:04:27,053 --> 00:04:30,032
during the transfer 
from the Earth to Mars,

87
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:31,502
that would be an advantage.

88
00:04:31,502 --> 00:04:33,028
That could be provide by tethers.

89
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:38,547
And Earth-Moon payload transfer 
is also one possible application

90
00:04:38,547 --> 00:04:40,311
and space elevator, we'll talk about that.

91
00:04:42,098 --> 00:04:45,687
Now in the electrodynamical application 
of space tethers,

92
00:04:45,687 --> 00:04:49,317
you can either use a system 
as an electrical generator

93
00:04:49,317 --> 00:04:51,293
or as an electrical motor.

94
00:04:51,464 --> 00:04:53,921
Let's look at the applications 
as an electrical generator.

95
00:04:54,092 --> 00:04:57,899
That's the Space Shuttle, we have tether
deployed vertically

96
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:01,179
along the local vertical, all the way 
to this point here

97
00:05:01,179 --> 00:05:05,492
where we have a satellite 
which is hopefully a good conductor,

98
00:05:05,492 --> 00:05:10,196
has good electrical contact 
with the ambient plasma.

99
00:05:13,912 --> 00:05:18,045
Because of the induction effect 
and this is Faraday's law.

100
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:22,965
The voltage is going to be equal to 
the cross products

101
00:05:22,965 --> 00:05:26,449
of the velocity and the magnetic field

102
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:28,468
and then dot product with <i>L</i>,

103
00:05:28,468 --> 00:05:31,489
<i>L</i> being along the vector in the direction 
of the positive current.

104
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:34,080
Now in this case we have a <i>V</i> here.

105
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:40,183
We have the <i>B</i> vector in this direction

106
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,847
and this is valid if we are relatively 
close to the equator,

107
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:50,953
which remains on an orbit 
which is on one hand relatively low,

108
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:53,289
a few hundred kilometers 
above the Earth's surface.

109
00:05:53,289 --> 00:05:56,910
So we are in the ionosphere 
and also we have the <i>B</i> vector

110
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:59,498
pretty much horizontal, 
in the vicinity of the equator.

111
00:06:00,029 --> 00:06:03,947
<i>V</i> cross <i>B</i> will give you a vector 
in this direction.

112
00:06:04,935 --> 00:06:07,688
So the negative current will be downwards

113
00:06:07,688 --> 00:06:10,748
because this is the direction 
of the positive charge up

114
00:06:10,748 --> 00:06:15,177
and of course electrical current 
come from electrons coming down

115
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:18,490
that will load the lower body negatively

116
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:22,688
and the upper body will be
loaded positively.

117
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:25,929
Again, that's like if we had a big battery
in the ionosphere

118
00:06:25,929 --> 00:06:30,138
with a positive pole on the top, 
a negative pole on the bottom

119
00:06:30,138 --> 00:06:37,175
and you create this EMF, 
electric motor force, in this way.

120
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:43,179
And again, if you have a way

121
00:06:43,179 --> 00:06:46,693
to close a circuit via the ionosphere

122
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:51,944
and for this you need, especially 
if you have a shadow at the bottom here,

123
00:06:51,944 --> 00:06:56,818
you need to have an electron gun 
reinjecting the ionosphere somehow

124
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:00,920
they find their way upwards, 
they are collected in the upper body,

125
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,660
like a satellite with a conductive pane 
for instance.

126
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,243
And the use of the system 
as an electric generator,

127
00:07:08,243 --> 00:07:10,274
of course this is represented here.

128
00:07:10,274 --> 00:07:11,978
We'll come back to that on the next slide

129
00:07:11,978 --> 00:07:14,854
but you have a Lorentz force, 
which is retrograde,

130
00:07:14,854 --> 00:07:18,391
which is going to cause 
a breaking of the system,

131
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:22,241
the lower body, which here is 
the Shuttle and tether itself

132
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:24,460
and satellite on the top

133
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,412
because there would be a cost 
to the electrical energy that you produce

134
00:07:28,412 --> 00:07:30,728
and the cost is of course 
the height of your orbit.

135
00:07:30,728 --> 00:07:34,583
If you have a retrograde force, 
you are going to decay your orbit slowly

136
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:37,182
and that's what you have 
to pay for the electricity.

137
00:07:37,182 --> 00:07:40,145
Tether used as an electric motor now.

138
00:07:40,145 --> 00:07:43,889
This is a really promising 
application of tethers,

139
00:07:43,889 --> 00:07:47,426
could be used, for instance, in the case 
of the International Space Station.

140
00:07:47,426 --> 00:07:51,396
You create a long tether, 
deploy it vertically from the ISS

141
00:07:51,396 --> 00:07:54,605
and then you do what I'm going 
to just describe in a minute,

142
00:07:54,605 --> 00:08:00,671
you can maintain the orbital altitude 
of the International Space Station

143
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:03,356
or even increase it without 
using any propellant.

144
00:08:06,982 --> 00:08:12,221
If instead of letting 
the electrons coming down,

145
00:08:12,221 --> 00:08:16,871
which is the natural motion 
as we described before,

146
00:08:16,871 --> 00:08:25,332
if we can use on top a plasma contactor 
and inject electrons with an electron gun

147
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:27,549
in the ionosphere,

148
00:08:27,549 --> 00:08:31,532
we are not going to have this 
but we are going to pump electrons up

149
00:08:31,532 --> 00:08:33,317
in the tether

150
00:08:34,065 --> 00:08:38,895
and the Lorentz force, 
the element of Lorentz force,

151
00:08:39,114 --> 00:08:45,141
is <i>dF = Idl</i> the element of length

152
00:08:46,311 --> 00:08:48,140
cross <i>B</i>

153
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:51,504
and you see that if you pump 
the electrons up

154
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:53,578
then the <i>I</i> vector will be down

155
00:08:53,578 --> 00:08:57,310
and the <i>I</i> is always in the motion 
of the positive charges

156
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:00,857
and then instead of having 
a retrograde Lorentz force,

157
00:09:00,857 --> 00:09:03,412
you are going to have 
a posigrade Lorentz force.

158
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:07,280
So what you have to pay 
is of course electrical energy

159
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:09,189
that you have to generate 
on the upper body,

160
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:11,373
inject electrons in the ionosphere,

161
00:09:11,373 --> 00:09:13,660
but you pump these electrons up

162
00:09:13,983 --> 00:09:16,669
and then you generate 
a posigrade Lorentz force

163
00:09:16,669 --> 00:09:21,094
that will be increasing 
the height of the orbit

164
00:09:21,094 --> 00:09:24,119
or if you have atmospheric drag 
you may compensate

165
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,950
exactly the atmospheric drag

166
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:27,722
and this way you can maintain the altitude

167
00:09:27,722 --> 00:09:29,826
despite atmospheric drag.

168
00:09:32,347 --> 00:09:35,716
Of course the electrons will be collected 
here at the bottom

169
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:37,878
at the level of the lower body.

170
00:09:39,773 --> 00:09:42,831
This is the use of the system 
as an electric motor

171
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:47,878
you have to use electrical power 
in order to

172
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:54,448
generate posigrade Lorentz force 
and maintain or heighten your orbit.

173
00:09:55,263 --> 00:09:59,605
And the total force on the tether 
is expressed here.

174
00:09:59,797 --> 00:10:01,735
This is an integral 
on the length of the tether.

175
00:10:03,692 --> 00:10:07,116
This element of the Lorentz force

176
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:11,487
and you find this here and of course 
you have to integrate this

177
00:10:11,487 --> 00:10:13,001
along the whole length of the tether.

178
00:10:13,001 --> 00:10:14,681
Of course if you have a very long tether,

179
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,531
it can be quite a sizable force

180
00:10:16,531 --> 00:10:20,205
but you can imagine that 
you vary the value of <i>I</i>

181
00:10:20,463 --> 00:10:23,350
in order to get a force,

182
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:28,935
a Lorentz force, a total Lorentz force 
that is exactly equal

183
00:10:28,935 --> 00:10:30,974
to the drag force due to the atmosphere.

184
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:35,525
So this is a very promising application 
for typically space stations

185
00:10:35,525 --> 00:10:37,095
on orbit around the Earth.

186
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:41,699
This is a summary of the electrodynamic
application of a tether.

187
00:10:41,699 --> 00:10:45,661
In this case we have kind of 
a space station here,

188
00:10:45,661 --> 00:10:48,183
elementary space station here, 
no longer the Shuttle.

189
00:10:48,374 --> 00:10:51,474
The Shuttle was used and we'll talk 
about that later to test the system

190
00:10:51,474 --> 00:10:56,278
but the promising application 
is obviously for space stations

191
00:10:56,278 --> 00:11:00,643
and on the left hand side

192
00:11:00,643 --> 00:11:05,472
you have the use of the system 
as a electrical generator,

193
00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:09,439
which wouldn't be really 
too useful for space station

194
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:11,595
because you have plenty of solar power

195
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:15,272
and using solar arrays is a much 
better way to get electricity

196
00:11:15,272 --> 00:11:18,733
or electrical power in a space station
then using a tether,

197
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:22,503
however, the use as an electric motor 
or a thrust

198
00:11:22,503 --> 00:11:24,998
is a very promising application.

199
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:28,068
As we mentioned before, 
under the first application

200
00:11:28,068 --> 00:11:30,097
used the Faraday induction law

201
00:11:30,097 --> 00:11:33,948
and the second application 
uses Lorentz expression

202
00:11:33,948 --> 00:11:36,933
integrated along 
the whole length of the tether.

203
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:43,279
In the early 80s of our century, 
we had two Italian scientists

204
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:48,427
Professor Colombo Giuseppe, 
Colombo from Padova, Italy

205
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:50,006
and Mario Grossi

206
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:53,377
from the Smithsonian Astrophysical 
Observatory in the United States

207
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:55,013
but an Italian also,

208
00:11:55,013 --> 00:11:58,753
who suggested to NASA 
and to the Italian Space Agency

209
00:11:58,753 --> 00:12:03,163
to test this concept of an 
electrical power generation using tethers

210
00:12:03,163 --> 00:12:08,248
and the idea at that time 
we didn't have the Shuttle flying

211
00:12:08,248 --> 00:12:11,133
even in the late 70s 
that the proposal was done,

212
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:14,824
Shuttle started to fly in 1981

213
00:12:14,824 --> 00:12:19,275
and the idea was to have 
this collaboration

214
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:22,885
between the Italians and the US

215
00:12:22,885 --> 00:12:25,393
to do a deployment of a long tether.

216
00:12:25,393 --> 00:12:28,697
The plan was for 20 kilometers upwards

217
00:12:28,697 --> 00:12:30,078
from the Space Shuttle.

218
00:12:32,408 --> 00:12:35,835
In order to verify 
the electrical power generation

219
00:12:35,895 --> 00:12:37,569
it was going to be a conducting tether,

220
00:12:37,569 --> 00:12:41,170
electrical conducting tether, 
altitude about 300 kilometers.

221
00:12:41,170 --> 00:12:43,346
So well within the ionosphere

222
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:45,910
and on the low inclination orbit.

223
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:48,351
The idea was to go on the lowest 
possible inclination orbit

224
00:12:48,351 --> 00:12:51,225
from Kennedy space center,
which the latitude of

225
00:12:51,397 --> 00:12:54,213
Kennedy space center, 
28.5 degrees.

226
00:12:54,897 --> 00:12:58,001
So the conditions were there 
to really test properly

227
00:12:58,001 --> 00:13:02,167
the capability of this system 
to generate electrical power

228
00:13:02,167 --> 00:13:04,725
but another objective of the mission 
was really to see

229
00:13:04,725 --> 00:13:06,610
how we could control such a system.

230
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:10,473
It's not obvious to properly 
control a satellite

231
00:13:10,473 --> 00:13:13,517
at the end of a flexible tether

232
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:20,279
deploying upwards and then controlling 
the whole geometry

233
00:13:20,279 --> 00:13:21,807
and dynamics of the tether,

234
00:13:21,807 --> 00:13:25,062
at the same time as generating electricity

235
00:13:25,062 --> 00:13:28,193
through the induction effect 
as I described before.

236
00:13:31,005 --> 00:13:32,870
Here you see it's not up to scale.

237
00:13:32,999 --> 00:13:35,646
The altitude was going to be 
only 300 kilometers

238
00:13:35,646 --> 00:13:38,900
and the radius of the Earth 
is 6,300 kilometers

239
00:13:39,157 --> 00:13:41,978
but that's the principle that was agreed

240
00:13:41,978 --> 00:13:46,539
and the mission eventually flew 
at STS 46 in 1992.

241
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:51,110
Was repeated then in 1996 as STS 75

242
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,608
and I had the privilege of being there 
on these two missions.
