Well let's look at three axis attitude control system using thrusters for a very simple, very elementary spacecraft and we see that we need a minimum of 12 thrusters.
If you want to have pure rotations
I mean by that rotation that will not be associated with translations this is the center mass of our simple spacecraft.
This is the roll axis, the pitch axis, roll is X, pitch axis is Y and this the Z axis, the yaw axis.
Now you need four thrusters for each axis.
You need two thrusters for the acceleration of pulse to initiate the rotation and two opposite thrusters for the braking pulse.
If you want to do, for instance, positive roll you need this thruster at the same time than this thruster here to be fired at the same time with more or less square profile then you engage the rotation in around the roll axis or X axis and in order to stop the rotation, you need to use this thruster and this thruster and that would stop the rotation.
So for pure rotation with no associated translation you need four thrusters per degree of freedom or per rotation axis, 12 total.
Let's look at attitude maneuver around one axis using thrusters.
This is the initial situation where we do the studying impulse or the acceleration impulse and this is the end where we're going to do the braking impulse.
We have spacecraft or vehicle with a moment of inertia <i>I_v</i>.
We have this thruster and this thruster to engage the rotation and the thrust for each of these thrusters has a value of <i>F</i> and <i>L</i> is the distance between the center of mass and thruster cluster.
Now, this is going to be the profile on one hand alpha, the angular acceleration, the angular velocity omega, and theta the angle.
Now we take a simple case where we have basically a rectangular acceleration pulse, we fire the thruster.
It has constant thrust for time <i>t_b</i> is for t burn.
Then we consider that we let the spacecraft coast for awhile with a time, <i>t_c</i>, for time coast and then we have a braking impulse again, rectangular with the same time as for the acceleration with <i>t_b</i> here.
Okay, so that's going to be the profile of alpha basically that's simplified rectangular profile and of course profile of omega, the angular velocity would be like this with <i>omega= alpha t</i> for this rising portion, which is linear and for theta, we'll have <i>theta = half alpha t squared</i>, just for this portion here.
Now when we have the coast, obviously we have a constant angular velocity, we'll call this <i>omega max</i>.
We will not go about this one and for the angle we'll have linear increase the value of theta during the coast phase.
And during the braking phase, again, we have <i>t_b</i>, we have linear decreasing value of omega here and of course we have value of theta varying according to parabola in fact, all the way to <i>theta m</i>, which is the maximum, or theta maneuver rather that we'll be reaching.
Now let's look at some values here.
We have basically the law of Newton for translation,
<i>F = m a </i> and the equivalent for rotation.
We've seen this in the past. 
Torque equal the moment of inertia,
<i>V</i> for vehicle, times alpha, the angular acceleration.
And let's go to the next slide now to continue this derivation.
With the arrangement of thrusters that we have, we have <i>alpha = n</i>, the number of thrusters active at the same time, which is two time <i>F</i>, the thrust,
<i>L</i>, the distance between the thruster cluster and the center mass, divided by <i>I_v</i> and we said we have <i>omega max</i> and <i>omega max</i> is going to be equal to <i>nFL</i> divided by <i>I_v</i> times <i>t_b</i>, the time of burn here.
Now, the value of theta along that parabolic arch here is going to be theta of <i>t</i> equals <i>nFL</i> divided by <i>2 I_v</i> times <i>t squared</i>.
And now we can derive an expression for the value of theta maneuver, theta maneuver is going to be equal to these two segments here corresponding to the acceleration and then the braking plus the coast that we have here.
So it's going to be two times the increase of theta that we had for the acceleration, two times this value here, here and there.
So it's going to be
<i>nFL</i> over <i>I_v</i> times <i>t_b squared</i> plus the value corresponding to the coast, which is this one here, so it's <i>nFL</i> divided by <i>I_v</i> times <i>t_b</i> times <i>t coast</i>.
So this is the theta that we have for the maneuver considering the geometrical consideration, also the thruster or thrusters. We are using two thrusters for the acceleration and two for the braking in the same cluster.
Now if we're interested in the propellant used for this maneuver, we have the following: remember that <i>Isp</i> is equal to
<i>n</i>, the number of thrusters times <i>F</i>, the thrust in newton divided by <i>g m dot_propellant</i> or remember we can also say that it's the total thrust in kilogram divided by <i>m dot</i> but here we take the total thrust divided by <i>g</i>, which is the thrust in newton.
So we have <i>m_p</i> equal two times <i>t_b</i>, the time of the burn, two times because we have the acceleration and then the braking using the same amount of propellant, times <i>m dot p</i> and equal to <i>2nFt_b</i> divided by <i>g Isp</i>, on the basis of that.
So that's another important piece of data.
The amount of propellant required for this simple maneuver of acceleration plus coast, which doesn't use any propellant then the braking.
