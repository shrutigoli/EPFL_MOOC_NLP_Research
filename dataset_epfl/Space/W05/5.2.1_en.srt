00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,546
Hello everyone, welcome to 
this section

2
00:00:08,546 --> 00:00:10,598
on selected spacecraft systems.

3
00:00:10,598 --> 00:00:15,001
We'll talk about attitude control, 
attitude measurement and control.

4
00:00:15,001 --> 00:00:17,600
We'll talk about electrical power 
generation the spacecraft

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,814
different methods 
of generating electrical power,

6
00:00:20,814 --> 00:00:26,923
and there will be a small 
sub-section on reliability

7
00:00:26,923 --> 00:00:28,785
and redundancy.

8
00:00:30,295 --> 00:00:34,438
Let's start with the attitude measurement
and control systems.

9
00:00:34,438 --> 00:00:38,524
If you have either a man-made 
spacecraft in space

10
00:00:38,524 --> 00:00:43,589
or a natural object like an asteroid 
or a comet nucleus,

11
00:00:44,457 --> 00:00:48,338
it's going to be in space
very slowly rotating

12
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:53,061
subject to possibly 
gravity gradient forces,

13
00:00:53,061 --> 00:00:55,085
if it is in the vicinity of a large body.

14
00:00:56,058 --> 00:00:58,218
The sun radiation 
there's radiation pressure,

15
00:00:58,416 --> 00:01:01,689
there's solar wind which has 
an influence also on the orientation

16
00:01:01,689 --> 00:01:04,452
of the spacecraft or the natural body.

17
00:01:05,226 --> 00:01:07,445
If it is in the vicinity of a planet 
with an atmosphere

18
00:01:07,636 --> 00:01:11,333
there is an atmospheric effect 
which will change its orientation

19
00:01:11,333 --> 00:01:12,652
depending on its shape,

20
00:01:12,652 --> 00:01:15,702
its mass, and orientation 
of the velocity vector

21
00:01:15,702 --> 00:01:17,179
versus geometry.

22
00:01:17,705 --> 00:01:19,725
There could be possibly 
magnetic effect or so

23
00:01:19,725 --> 00:01:21,842
if it is made of a magnetic material.

24
00:01:21,842 --> 00:01:24,508
So all of these effects will have 
an influence on the attitude

25
00:01:24,508 --> 00:01:29,047
of a natural object or man-made 
spacecraft with attitude control.

26
00:01:29,047 --> 00:01:31,927
If you want to do something 
useful with a spacecraft

27
00:01:31,927 --> 00:01:34,245
you need an attitude control system

28
00:01:34,245 --> 00:01:38,997
and you have fixed coordinate system
with respect to the spacecraft itself

29
00:01:38,997 --> 00:01:43,787
and you try to control the orientation 
of these three axis

30
00:01:43,787 --> 00:01:47,667
versus either inertial or Earth based
coordinate system.

31
00:01:49,082 --> 00:01:53,681
The term used for attitude measurement
and control system is AMCS.

32
00:01:53,882 --> 00:01:55,607
It consists in measuring and maintaining

33
00:01:55,607 --> 00:01:59,576
the orientation of a coordinate system,
as I mentioned before,

34
00:01:59,576 --> 00:02:01,763
attached to the spacecraft 
with respect to inertial

35
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:03,809
or any other relevant system.

36
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:09,527
For either an airplane 
or for a winged spacecraft,

37
00:02:09,527 --> 00:02:12,813
like a Space Shuttle or Dream Chaser 
for that matter,

38
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:16,384
we usually choose such coordinate system

39
00:02:16,817 --> 00:02:20,577
it's centered on the center 
of mass of the spacecraft.

40
00:02:20,577 --> 00:02:25,689
It has <i>+ X</i> to the nose 
of the winged spacecraft.

41
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:32,465
The Y axis to the right wing 
and the Z axis to the belly

42
00:02:32,465 --> 00:02:34,723
of the winged spacecraft or airplane

43
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:40,218
and the reason we choose 
these is that we want to have pitch

44
00:02:41,182 --> 00:02:46,293
around the Y axis, positive, 
when we take the nose up

45
00:02:46,676 --> 00:02:48,314
for the spacecraft

46
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:51,533
and we want to have roll 
and yaw positive to the right.

47
00:02:51,533 --> 00:02:56,188
This is a convention 
for pilots and spaceship

48
00:02:56,188 --> 00:02:59,853
or aircraft operators, 
which is quite widely used.

49
00:03:00,958 --> 00:03:05,013
So X forward, Y to the right, 
and Z down to the belly.

50
00:03:05,236 --> 00:03:09,925
If you have a spacecraft in general 
you can choose as a designer

51
00:03:12,238 --> 00:03:15,968
or builder the direction 
of your axis of coordinates,

52
00:03:15,968 --> 00:03:18,570
plus X, plus Y, and plus Z

53
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,685
as an orthogonal coordinate system.

54
00:03:23,347 --> 00:03:25,853
This is the International Space Station

55
00:03:25,853 --> 00:03:29,192
on orbit about 400km 
above the Earth's surface

56
00:03:29,192 --> 00:03:34,654
and the choice of the spacecraft 
fixed coordinate system

57
00:03:34,654 --> 00:03:37,225
is pretty much like in aviation 
where we have

58
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:41,331
here the forward portion of ISS

59
00:03:41,331 --> 00:03:44,065
oriented toward the velocity vector

60
00:03:44,065 --> 00:03:53,567
and that's a <i>+ X</i> axis and we have Y 
to the starboard portion of the thrust

61
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:57,163
at the end of which are the solar arrays
and Z down to the center of the Earth.

62
00:03:57,999 --> 00:04:02,362
So this is a fixed coordinate system 
attached to the station itself

63
00:04:02,362 --> 00:04:06,123
and with respect to-- 
we'll see this later--

64
00:04:06,476 --> 00:04:10,495
LVLH, local vertical 
local horizontal coordinate system

65
00:04:10,752 --> 00:04:12,517
we normally have zero zero zero,

66
00:04:12,517 --> 00:04:16,602
which means the X coordinate system 
of the station would be

67
00:04:16,602 --> 00:04:17,789
toward the velocity vector

68
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,362
and Z down to the center of the Earth.

69
00:04:20,204 --> 00:04:24,654
Now it's always good to try imagine 
what orientation your spacecraft has

70
00:04:24,654 --> 00:04:27,163
when you have (0,0,0)

71
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:33,943
for pitch, yaw and roll, that situation that
we have for the Space Shuttle. You orient

72
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:36,322
X, Y, and Z attached to the Space Shuttle.

73
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:42,065
With the axis in this case of the
geocentric coordinate system

74
00:04:42,065 --> 00:04:46,924
and if you want your attitude 
indicator inside the spaceship

75
00:04:46,924 --> 00:04:51,033
in fact it was available for the commander
and the pilot of the Space Shuttle

76
00:04:51,033 --> 00:04:53,021
on the instrument panel.

77
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:58,709
If you wanted to indicate 
the inertial attitude in pitch,

78
00:04:58,839 --> 00:05:01,922
yaw and roll and if you wanted 
to indicate zero

79
00:05:01,922 --> 00:05:04,463
you will have to have this orientation.

80
00:05:04,909 --> 00:05:09,449
You see the Space Shuttle here with
the nose pointed towards Vernal Equinox

81
00:05:09,449 --> 00:05:11,502
for the year 2000, for instance.

82
00:05:12,399 --> 00:05:14,783
The plane of the wings 
in the plane of the equator,

83
00:05:14,783 --> 00:05:20,312
the belly towards the Z axis 
or the north axis of the Earth.

84
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:24,514
This is the orientation 
of the Shuttle that you have

85
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:30,296
reading (0,0,0) in pitch or roll in 
your attitude indicator in the cockpit.

86
00:05:30,906 --> 00:05:34,697
Now there's another important 
coordinate system that is being used,

87
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:37,653
especially for the spaceship 
like the International Space Station

88
00:05:37,653 --> 00:05:42,060
and the Shuttle also and other 
Earth viewing spacecraft.

89
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:45,779
It's so called LVLH coordinate system

90
00:05:45,779 --> 00:05:47,129
and it's defined here.

91
00:05:47,808 --> 00:05:49,541
This is the position of the spacecraft,

92
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:54,076
in this case the Space Shuttle 
at the LVLH coordinate system has

93
00:05:54,076 --> 00:05:57,574
X in the direction of the velocity vector

94
00:05:57,574 --> 00:05:59,055
for circular orbit,

95
00:05:59,277 --> 00:06:04,006
you have Y toward the south of the orbit,

96
00:06:04,006 --> 00:06:06,348
and you have Z towards 
the center of the Earth.

97
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:10,719
So it's an orthogonal 
coordinate system, LVLH,

98
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:12,782
and if you have an Earth viewing spacecraft

99
00:06:12,782 --> 00:06:17,659
you would try to figure out 
or control the attitude of the spacecraft

100
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:19,943
versus this LVLH coordinate system.

101
00:06:19,943 --> 00:06:22,730
Again, LVLH, local vertical 
local horizontal.

102
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:30,151
Now you have to realize that 
the rotations around X, Y, and Z

103
00:06:30,151 --> 00:06:31,761
are non commutative.

104
00:06:32,211 --> 00:06:34,557
You have to follow a certain 
unit sequence.

105
00:06:34,812 --> 00:06:38,735
You have to specify the unit sequence 
in each case.

106
00:06:39,353 --> 00:06:44,008
Normally the unit sequence 
for spacecraft is Yaw, Pitch, and Roll

107
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:48,227
but for the Space Shuttle, 
for the International Space Station,

108
00:06:48,227 --> 00:06:52,916
including all of the robotic systems 
that are associated with the Space Station

109
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:57,517
whether it is the Space Station 
robotic system from Canada

110
00:06:57,517 --> 00:07:01,333
or for that matter, 
the Shuttle robotic system

111
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,033
that was used for the assembly 
of the International Space Station.

112
00:07:04,918 --> 00:07:07,300
We have the sequence, the unit sequence,

113
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:11,053
Pitch, Yaw, and Roll and to indicate

114
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:13,495
or illustrate the importance 
of the sequence,

115
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:17,418
let's take pitch 90, yaw 90,

116
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:22,718
and roll zero, so imagine 
that you start with (0,0,0)

117
00:07:23,168 --> 00:07:27,187
with respect to the-- for instance, 
LVLH coordinate system

118
00:07:27,335 --> 00:07:33,817
you do pitch 90, yaw 90, and roll 0, 
so you end up with this orientation

119
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:41,247
with the belly of the Space Shuttle 
or the belly of the winged system

120
00:07:41,247 --> 00:07:43,617
the Space Shuttle in the direction 
of the velocity vector.

121
00:07:44,009 --> 00:07:45,709
Now if you do another sequence,

122
00:07:45,709 --> 00:07:49,502
if you start with yaw 90 and pitch 90,

123
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:51,366
you see that you have 
different orientation

124
00:07:51,366 --> 00:07:53,902
with respect to the LVLH coordinate system

125
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,857
So the unit sequence is important 
to be respected.

126
00:07:56,857 --> 00:08:01,216
In the case of the space shuttle, 
it's always Pitch, Yaw, and Roll last.
