Hello everyone and welcome to Unit 5:
Selected Spacecraft Systems.

2
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:13,781
This week we'll talk about
attitude control,

3
00:00:14,255 --> 00:00:16,055
electrical power generation,

4
00:00:16,055 --> 00:00:18,535
classical and alternative methods,

5
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:21,007
reliability of space systems.

6
00:00:21,494 --> 00:00:24,284
Here you see a nice view
of one of the wings

7
00:00:24,284 --> 00:00:27,014
of the International
Space Station solar arrays.

8
00:00:27,014 --> 00:00:30,254
There are eight such wings,

9
00:00:30,254 --> 00:00:32,954
and each of the wings,
like you see here,

10
00:00:33,448 --> 00:00:37,558
is providing more than 10 kilowatts
of electrical power

11
00:00:37,558 --> 00:00:39,268
to the International Space Station

12
00:00:39,268 --> 00:00:41,238
considering the size of the array

13
00:00:41,238 --> 00:00:43,268
and the efficiency of the solar cells.

14
00:00:44,494 --> 00:00:47,064
Now we have prepared
some practice quizzes

15
00:00:47,064 --> 00:00:51,254
after each video to make sure
that you understand the concepts

16
00:00:51,257 --> 00:00:53,047
explained in these videos.

17
00:00:53,047 --> 00:00:59,007
Each section from 5.2 to 5.4
is concluded by a control quiz.

18
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:02,393
In addition, there is a test
at the end of the unit.

19
00:01:02,977 --> 00:01:06,277
To illustrate this unit,
we have prepared a focus

20
00:01:06,277 --> 00:01:11,267
on Hayabusa with an interview
of Hitoshi Kuninaka from JAXA.

21
00:01:11,971 --> 00:01:13,751
Looking at this is not compulsory.

22
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:16,281
It's facultative,
but we encourage you to do it

23
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:19,791
in order to deepen your knowledge
about this particular subject.
