1
00:00:05,556 --> 00:00:08,805
Let's talk about spacecraft
closed-loop attitude control.

2
00:00:08,805 --> 00:00:10,895
You have your spacecraft here,

3
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:15,056
represented here as a cube

4
00:00:15,783 --> 00:00:20,340
with <i>X, Y, and Z</i>.

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:24,161
Then you have requirements as far
as the orientation of these three axes

6
00:00:24,161 --> 00:00:28,766
versus a reference coordinate system,
and you have attitude errors.

7
00:00:28,998 --> 00:00:32,227
They're measured by sensors,
whether they are gyros,

8
00:00:32,227 --> 00:00:36,036
or horizon sensors, sun sensors,
or star trackers, for that matter.

9
00:00:36,562 --> 00:00:38,943
And these errors are transmitted

10
00:00:38,943 --> 00:00:41,560
into a computer
that contains a control law,

11
00:00:41,926 --> 00:00:45,834
and the control law decides
what effectors,

12
00:00:46,206 --> 00:00:49,410
and with what amplitude,
and what method will be used

13
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,894
in order to control these errors
and reduce these errors to zero.

14
00:00:52,894 --> 00:00:56,401
Either thrusters, or reaction wheels,
momentum wheels,

15
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,580
it's the same thing,
or control momentum gyros.

16
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,389
We'll talk about that later,

17
00:01:00,389 --> 00:01:02,701
and the corrections,
and getting there to the spacecraft,

18
00:01:02,701 --> 00:01:04,427
and it's obviously a loop,

19
00:01:05,230 --> 00:01:09,392
in a constant control of the attitude,

20
00:01:10,391 --> 00:01:13,238
the actual attitude versus
the required attitude.

21
00:01:14,527 --> 00:01:16,884
As far as accuracy of the attitude,

22
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:19,151
of course it depends
on what you want to do.

23
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:23,268
For solar arrays it will typically 
lose four to ten degrees.

24
00:01:23,268 --> 00:01:26,480
Remember, the cosine
of ten degrees is about 0.98,

25
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:30,021
so if you have a not-perfectly-
oriented solar panel,

26
00:01:30,021 --> 00:01:31,588
it doesn't really matter.

27
00:01:32,818 --> 00:01:35,967
For high grain antennas
it has to be a little more precise,

28
00:01:35,967 --> 00:01:37,875
better than a degree.

29
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,039
For optical systems
you have, typically,

30
00:01:40,566 --> 00:01:44,916
10^(-4) to 10^(-1) degree.

31
00:01:45,834 --> 00:01:49,334
There is one special case,
it's the Hubble Space Telescope,

32
00:01:49,334 --> 00:01:53,269
which had to maintain its orientation
to within 0.007 of an arcsecond,

33
00:01:53,269 --> 00:01:55,835
which is, of course,
a very, very high accuracy,

34
00:01:55,835 --> 00:02:00,180
and it was achieved
through pictures of stars

35
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:02,966
that were obtained
through fine guidance sensors,

36
00:02:02,966 --> 00:02:05,918
three fine guidance sensors
which were providing pictures

37
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:09,589
around the area that was being looked at,

38
00:02:09,589 --> 00:02:12,776
whether it was a galaxy, or a cluster 
of galaxies or another object,

39
00:02:12,776 --> 00:02:15,334
and in the field of view
of these fine guidance sensors

40
00:02:15,334 --> 00:02:18,995
we chose two stars, and these stars
were maintained very precisely,

41
00:02:18,995 --> 00:02:22,906
in the same location, using
the closed-loop attitude control system.

42
00:02:22,906 --> 00:02:25,218
But the sensor was
really fine guidance sensors,

43
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:29,370
extremely precise,
again, 0.007 of an arc second,

44
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,568
and you could maintain
this orientation accuracy

45
00:02:32,568 --> 00:02:35,776
to within hours, or even days.

46
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:38,928
The Hubble Ultra Deep Field
was taken in ten days,

47
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:42,122
and its telescope maintained
that very precise attitude

48
00:02:42,122 --> 00:02:43,836
for this long duration.

49
00:02:44,323 --> 00:02:47,453
Stabilization by rotation,
not used too much nowadays,

50
00:02:47,453 --> 00:02:51,639
but in the early version
of the communication satellites,

51
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,026
basically you maintained
inertial orientation

52
00:02:55,026 --> 00:02:56,782
by spinning the spacecraft

53
00:02:57,505 --> 00:03:01,083
with the sun vector perpendicular
to the axis of rotation.

54
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:05,596
Disadvantages are relatively low,
accuracy and orientation,

55
00:03:05,596 --> 00:03:09,604
and also you could not point
any antennas or other devices

56
00:03:09,604 --> 00:03:11,450
except in the direction of the axis,

57
00:03:11,450 --> 00:03:14,348
so that was a big disadvantage,
but it was still closed loop.

58
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:18,216
We had to maintain properly
the orientation of the rotation axis

59
00:03:18,216 --> 00:03:20,884
versus the sun vector,
that was the main constraint.

60
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,695
Much better accuracy
with a three-axis stabilization.

61
00:03:25,695 --> 00:03:28,120
There are several methods
we'll talk about later.

62
00:03:29,654 --> 00:03:33,451
Of course it's a very complex system.
You need redundancy.

63
00:03:34,382 --> 00:03:36,571
You have an example here of a spacecraft

64
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:41,129
which is maintaining its orientation
using momentum wheels,

65
00:03:41,129 --> 00:03:45,238
and you change the speed of rotation
of these momentum wheels

66
00:03:45,238 --> 00:03:48,814
and you can act on the spacecraft
to maintain its orientation.

67
00:03:48,814 --> 00:03:52,000
But sometimes you get saturation,
so you need to have,

68
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,628
for instance, thrusters,
to remove the excess momentum.

69
00:03:54,628 --> 00:03:56,262
We'll come back to that.

70
00:03:56,262 --> 00:04:00,837
This is a very widely used system
of closed loop control

71
00:04:00,837 --> 00:04:04,218
of the orientation of the spacecraft,
much more often used

72
00:04:04,218 --> 00:04:08,041
than the other ones I talked about before,
and much more precise also.

73
00:04:08,301 --> 00:04:13,104
The main techniques for three-axis
stabilization and reorientation:

74
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:15,936
thrusters, a good example
is the Space Shuttle,

75
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:19,548
or the Russian segment
of the International Space Station.

76
00:04:20,182 --> 00:04:22,984
And there are two methods
using a gyroscope,

77
00:04:22,984 --> 00:04:26,389
a reaction or momentum wheels.
Hubble is an example.

78
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:28,271
Changing the rotation speed of these

79
00:04:28,271 --> 00:04:30,894
will change the orientation
of the spacecraft.

80
00:04:31,229 --> 00:04:34,222
The control moment gyros, or CMG is used

81
00:04:34,222 --> 00:04:36,741
in the U.S. segment
of the International Space Station.

82
00:04:36,741 --> 00:04:38,608
We'll come back to that, also.
