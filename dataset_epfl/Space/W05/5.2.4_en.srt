1
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:10,040
Well let's look at three axis 
attitude control system

2
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:14,630
using thrusters for a very simple, 
very elementary spacecraft

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:18,456
and we see that we need 
a minimum of 12 thrusters.

4
00:00:18,456 --> 00:00:22,279
If you want to have pure rotations

5
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:27,141
I mean by that rotation that will 
not be associated with translations

6
00:00:27,704 --> 00:00:30,523
this is the center mass
of our simple spacecraft.

7
00:00:30,523 --> 00:00:32,197
This is the roll axis,

8
00:00:32,197 --> 00:00:37,085
the pitch axis, roll is X, 
pitch axis is Y

9
00:00:37,458 --> 00:00:41,070
and this the Z axis, the yaw axis.

10
00:00:41,813 --> 00:00:45,672
Now you need four thrusters

11
00:00:45,672 --> 00:00:47,618
for each axis.

12
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:51,014
You need two thrusters for 
the acceleration of pulse

13
00:00:51,014 --> 00:00:54,208
to initiate the rotation 
and two opposite thrusters

14
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:55,497
for the braking pulse.

15
00:00:55,497 --> 00:00:58,785
If you want to do, for instance, 
positive roll

16
00:00:58,785 --> 00:01:03,031
you need this thruster at the same time 
than this thruster here

17
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:06,389
to be fired at the same time 
with more or less square profile

18
00:01:06,389 --> 00:01:11,691
then you engage the rotation 
in around the roll axis or X axis

19
00:01:11,691 --> 00:01:13,968
and in order to stop the rotation,

20
00:01:13,968 --> 00:01:18,284
you need to use this thruster 
and this thruster

21
00:01:18,284 --> 00:01:20,195
and that would stop the rotation.

22
00:01:20,195 --> 00:01:24,389
So for pure rotation with 
no associated translation

23
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:27,959
you need four thrusters 
per degree of freedom

24
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:30,654
or per rotation axis, 12 total.

25
00:01:30,654 --> 00:01:34,931
Let's look at attitude maneuver 
around one axis using thrusters.

26
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:37,390
This is the initial situation where we do

27
00:01:38,689 --> 00:01:41,776
the studying impulse 
or the acceleration impulse

28
00:01:41,776 --> 00:01:44,872
and this is the end where we're going 
to do the braking impulse.

29
00:01:45,167 --> 00:01:51,672
We have spacecraft or vehicle 
with a moment of inertia <i>I_v</i>.

30
00:01:51,997 --> 00:01:56,313
We have this thruster and this thruster 
to engage the rotation

31
00:01:56,313 --> 00:02:00,449
and the thrust for each 
of these thrusters has a value of <i>F</i>

32
00:02:00,449 --> 00:02:04,660
and <i>L</i> is the distance between 
the center of mass and thruster cluster.

33
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:08,065
Now, this is going to be

34
00:02:08,065 --> 00:02:12,577
the profile on one hand alpha, 
the angular acceleration,

35
00:02:12,577 --> 00:02:15,308
the angular velocity omega, 
and theta the angle.

36
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:17,939
Now we take a simple case 
where we have basically

37
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,980
a rectangular acceleration pulse,

38
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:21,242
we fire the thruster.

39
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:27,132
It has constant thrust 
for time <i>t_b</i> is for t burn.

40
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:32,899
Then we consider that we let 
the spacecraft coast for awhile

41
00:02:32,899 --> 00:02:37,240
with a time, <i>t_c</i>, for time coast

42
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,298
and then we have 
a braking impulse again,

43
00:02:40,298 --> 00:02:45,779
rectangular with the same time 
as for the acceleration with <i>t_b</i> here.

44
00:02:46,706 --> 00:02:49,961
Okay, so that's going 
to be the profile of alpha

45
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:54,301
basically that's simplified 
rectangular profile

46
00:02:54,301 --> 00:02:58,235
and of course profile of omega, 
the angular velocity would be like this

47
00:02:58,235 --> 00:03:02,855
with <i>omega= alpha t</i>
for this rising portion,

48
00:03:02,855 --> 00:03:05,779
which is linear and for theta,

49
00:03:05,779 --> 00:03:11,795
we'll have <i>theta = half alpha t squared</i>,

50
00:03:12,054 --> 00:03:13,847
just for this portion here.

51
00:03:13,847 --> 00:03:15,583
Now when we have the coast,

52
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:20,046
obviously we have a constant 
angular velocity,

53
00:03:20,046 --> 00:03:22,269
we'll call this <i>omega max</i>.

54
00:03:23,386 --> 00:03:26,243
We will not go about this one
and for the angle

55
00:03:26,243 --> 00:03:28,923
we'll have linear increase

56
00:03:28,923 --> 00:03:31,349
the value of theta 
during the coast phase.

57
00:03:31,585 --> 00:03:35,465
And during the braking phase, 
again, we have <i>t_b</i>,

58
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:40,581
we have linear decreasing value 
of omega here

59
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:44,979
and of course we have value 
of theta varying

60
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:49,728
according to parabola in fact, 
all the way to <i>theta m</i>,

61
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:53,885
which is the maximum, or theta maneuver
rather that we'll be reaching.

62
00:03:54,222 --> 00:03:57,302
Now let's look at some values here.

63
00:03:57,302 --> 00:04:00,538
We have basically the law of Newton
for translation,

64
00:04:00,538 --> 00:04:05,238
<i>F = m a </i> and the equivalent for rotation.

65
00:04:05,238 --> 00:04:10,601
We've seen this in the past. 
Torque equal the moment of inertia,

66
00:04:10,601 --> 00:04:15,645
<i>V</i> for vehicle, times alpha, 
the angular acceleration.

67
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:21,113
And let's go to the next slide now 
to continue this derivation.

68
00:04:24,618 --> 00:04:26,631
With the arrangement 
of thrusters that we have,

69
00:04:26,631 --> 00:04:30,544
we have <i>alpha = n</i>, the number of thrusters

70
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:35,847
active at the same time, 
which is two time <i>F</i>, the thrust,

71
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:40,030
<i>L</i>, the distance between 
the thruster cluster

72
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:43,414
and the center mass, divided by <i>I_v</i>

73
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:51,350
and we said we have <i>omega max</i>
and <i>omega max</i>

74
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,322
is going to be equal to <i>nFL</i> divided by <i>I_v</i>

75
00:04:56,322 --> 00:04:59,892
times <i>t_b</i>, the time of burn here.

76
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:02,268
Now,

77
00:05:04,545 --> 00:05:09,148
the value of theta along 
that parabolic arch here

78
00:05:09,148 --> 00:05:15,530
is going to be theta of <i>t</i> equals <i>nFL</i>

79
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:23,360
divided by <i>2 I_v</i> times <i>t squared</i>.

80
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:29,668
And now we can derive an expression 
for the value of theta maneuver,

81
00:05:30,178 --> 00:05:34,566
theta maneuver is going to be equal to

82
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:41,853
these two segments here corresponding 
to the acceleration and then the braking

83
00:05:42,295 --> 00:05:44,805
plus the coast that we have here.

84
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:50,341
So it's going to be two times 
the increase of theta

85
00:05:50,341 --> 00:05:52,327
that we had for the acceleration,

86
00:05:52,327 --> 00:05:56,117
two times this value here, here and there.

87
00:05:56,882 --> 00:05:59,252
So it's going to be

88
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:04,807
<i>nFL</i> over <i>I_v</i>

89
00:06:06,232 --> 00:06:09,159
times <i>t_b squared</i>

90
00:06:09,928 --> 00:06:13,971
plus the value corresponding 
to the coast, which is this one here,

91
00:06:14,969 --> 00:06:20,507
so it's <i>nFL</i> divided by <i>I_v</i>

92
00:06:21,651 --> 00:06:25,793
times <i>t_b</i> times <i>t coast</i>.

93
00:06:29,585 --> 00:06:32,063
So this is the theta that we have 
for the maneuver

94
00:06:32,063 --> 00:06:34,953
considering the geometrical consideration,

95
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:38,843
also the thruster or thrusters. We are using 
two thrusters for the acceleration

96
00:06:38,843 --> 00:06:41,485
and two for the braking 
in the same cluster.

97
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:46,663
Now if we're interested in the propellant 
used for this maneuver,

98
00:06:48,075 --> 00:06:49,615
we have the following:

99
00:06:49,615 --> 00:06:53,704
remember that <i>Isp</i> is equal to

100
00:06:54,181 --> 00:06:58,211
<i>n</i>, the number of thrusters times <i>F</i>, 
the thrust in newton

101
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:02,304
divided by <i>g m dot_propellant</i>

102
00:07:03,363 --> 00:07:08,453
or remember we can also say that 
it's the total thrust in kilogram

103
00:07:08,453 --> 00:07:09,928
divided by <i>m dot</i>

104
00:07:09,928 --> 00:07:13,174
but here we take the total thrust 
divided by <i>g</i>,

105
00:07:13,174 --> 00:07:15,107
which is the thrust in newton.

106
00:07:15,856 --> 00:07:17,765
So we have <i>m_p</i>

107
00:07:19,167 --> 00:07:24,441
equal two times <i>t_b</i>, the time of the burn,

108
00:07:24,441 --> 00:07:26,667
two times because we have the acceleration

109
00:07:26,667 --> 00:07:29,459
and then the braking using 
the same amount of propellant,

110
00:07:29,851 --> 00:07:32,940
times <i>m dot p</i>

111
00:07:33,621 --> 00:07:39,364
and equal to <i>2nFt_b</i>

112
00:07:40,184 --> 00:07:42,122
divided by <i>g Isp</i>,

113
00:07:42,122 --> 00:07:43,895
on the basis of that.

114
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:47,842
So that's another important piece of data.

115
00:07:48,478 --> 00:07:52,118
The amount of propellant required 
for this simple maneuver

116
00:07:52,118 --> 00:07:55,268
of acceleration plus coast, 
which doesn't use any propellant

117
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:56,933
then the braking.
