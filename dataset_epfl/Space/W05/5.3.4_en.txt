The plans for a Shuttle-based
Tether mission, a joint project of the Italian
Space Agency and NASA, became more and more precise and concrete at the end of the 80s, of the last century.
The crew was selected in 1990 for a planned mission in 1991.
Eventually we flew in 1992, as STS-46, the 46th Shuttle mission.
We had a 20 km-long tether in a deployer system, on a big drum in the payload bay of the Shuttle, and in order to deploy the satellite at the end of the tether, but without the possibility of recontact with any part of the Shuttle, we had a deployable boom, at the end of which there was a nest, the satellite was located on this nest, and then the initial deployment was going to be done by firing small thrusters, cold gas thrusters in the bottom of the satellite.
It was going to move away from the Shuttle, and again, to a distance of 20 km, a pretty long process.
There was a so-called <i>control law</i>, of ð�‘™ dots or the time derivative of the length, that was a function of length.
The whole control law had been loaded in computers, and it was a pretty significant effort on the part of the Italians and of NASA to plan this mission.
Again, the orbit characteristics were 300 km altitude, so we were well within the ionosphere,
28.5-degree inclination orbit, to be close to the Equator.
We had communication with the satellite from the Space Shuttle, S-band, so we could command the satellite, we could command thrusters to change the orientation of the satellite by keyboard input from the cockpit.
And also there were a lot of scientific data, electrodynamic scientific data, that were going to be transmitted to the orbiter, then to the ground via this S-band system.
In addition, we had a KU-band tracking of the satellite with a KU-band antenna, which was just behind the starboard open payload bay door, so that we could track the satellite with radar, so we had an indication of the distance in addition to the distance that was provided from the deployer.
So here we are.
At the end of 1991, we were fully in training for this mission, the seven crew members, including the first Italian astronaut,
Franco Malerba, and Loren Shriver, a NASA astronaut, was the Commander of this mission.
One of the big challenges that, as crew members and also for the ground team of the Control Room in Houston, was the possibility of tether oscillations, and I'm going to describe the various types of tether oscillations.
Again, this is purely dynamic, it has nothing to do with the electrodynamic property, but only dynamic.
We have the in-plane libration of the tether.
If you imagine a swinging motion in-plane of the tether versus a local vertical.
We have the out-of-plane libration, the same kind of motion, but out of plane.
These were not too much of a problem, because you imagine that at the time, in this oscillation motion you have the tether in the local vertical, you can produce a Î”V at the level of the orbiter, in one direction or another, in order to damp this oscillation.
The longitudinal oscillations were a little bit trickier, because you had the possibility of oscillation along the direction of the tether.
The tether was basically a Kevlar cable, about 3 mm in diameter, with a copper coil for the conducting elements.
Longitudinal oscillations were a potential problem, but worse were really the so-called <i>skiprope oscillations</i>, you see here you have this rotation motion of the tether like a skiprope, or simply, I would say, the transverse oscillation that was also a possibility, without going to the skiprope geometry.
And it was really difficult to think of a way of damping those.
The last one was satellite pitch &amp; roll oscillations, we call this the bobbing motion of the satellite.
You can imagine that the satellite is just swinging in pitch and in roll.
The yaw didn't matter too much, but in pitch and in roll.
And obviously for such a length you had a resonance between these oscillation modes.
Typically there were, for a certain length, resonance between the skiprope oscillation frequency, and the bobbing motion of the satellite, a frequency, and there were not too many methods in order to dampen those.
By the way, let's come back to the in-plane libration and out-of-plane libration.
You can look at the detail of the dynamics in the reference that I mentioned before, and we have an interesting property for long tethers on orbit around the Earth.
You have the <i>n</i> in plane, which is equal to <i>2 pi</i> divided by the period in plane, is equal to the square root of 3 times the <i>n_orbital</i>, the orbital period, the orbital frequency, rather, the time, the period being in the denominator here, as you can see.
So you can determine, on the basis of a detailed analysis of the dynamic that for long tethers you have this relationship, and in this case, for the out of plane, we have the <i>n</i> out of plane, equals <i>2 pi</i>, times the period out of plane is equal to 2 times the <i>n_orbital</i>.
So it's a different period, a different frequency of the oscillation in plane and out of plane.
If you want the detail, you can have a look at the reference that I mentioned before.
Eureca and TSS-1, STS-46, the 46th Shuttle mission.
Lift off from Kennedy Space Center,
July the 31st.
There were two objectives in the mission, and we'll focus only on one of them.
But first we had to deploy the Eureka platform, which was a scientific platform from the European Space Agency, deployed from the payload bay of the Shuttle.
It was going to stay on orbit for about a year, and be recovered on a later Shuttle mission.
That picture is interesting, because it was at about sunrise, and we're overflying Kennedy Space Center.
We had lifted off a few days earlier from about this location here, a quite impressive picture.
Now, on the right-hand side you have what interests us here, the deployment of the tether satellite, TSS-1, and you see the top of that deployable boom that we had extended in the payload bay, about 12 m in size, and you have the beginning of the deployment of the satellite, under the thrust of the small thrusters in the bottom of the satellite to generate the lift of the satellite away from the boom.
Well, everything went well until about 200 meters, when we had suddenly an interruption of the deployment process.
In fact, there was a mechanical problem in the deployer, such that the deployment process suddenly stopped.
And you can imagine, because of the elasticity of the tether, the satellite came back to us, because the tether, after stopping this deployment motion, pulled the satellite back to us, and we had to work hard in order to control the orientation or the attitude of the satellite so that when the tether became taut again, in a straight line, we were not going to start generating bobbing motion of the satellite.
The Moon was very far away,
400,000 km, no problem with us, but that was certainly for us a big challenge.
We could still control the system, and get the retrieval process going, and we recovered the satellite and brought it back to Earth.
The Italian Space Agency and NASA decided to redo the experiments, because obviously this was only a very partial success on STS-46.
Still, we had been able to prove that even with low tension on the tether we were able to control the satellite.
So in this sense we had learned a lot, but the whole electrodynamic aspect and generation of electrical power, of course, we had missed completely.
So it was planned to have TSS-1R,
R for "repeat," on STS-75, in February-March 1996, or about four years later.
And here again you see the initial deployment of the satellite from the top of the boom.
The small thrusters were located here, were generating enough inner force to lift the satellite away from the basket.
This time we had a successful deployment, nearly to the target of 20 km, and there was a lot of activity in the payload bay, and in the cabin, as you can imagine.
Here you have just four out of the seven crew members, who are looking through the overhead windows in the back of the cockpit of the Space Shuttle using various cameras, and a laser rangefinder here, and I happen to be here, also communicating with the ground.
There was a lot of attention for this amazing deployment of a very long tether, on the local vertical, on top of the Space Shuttle orbiter.
And, surely before we reached 20 km, we had a sudden tether break.
That was completely unexpected, and a big surprise.
You see here, very shortly after the break-- the break was at the level of the deployer, not somewhere in between the Space Shuttle and the satellite, or at the level of the satellite, which, by the way, would have been dangerous, because with the elasticity of the tether it would have come back to us.
But anyway, it was at the level of the deployer.
You see the satellite on top here, and this is the bottom of the cut tether, and the tether break was due to a short in the system, and probably a default in the insulation of the tether that caused higher currents between the copper core and the metallic part of the deployer, and with a high voltage and a higher current the electrical power was such that it melted the tether, and it broke, and the satellite and the tether went away from us.
The reason why we have this coil here, it's just a memory of the tether that had been around this drum for a long time before this mission, for several months before the mission.
Well, the tether broke, and obviously this was unfortunate, because it meant that some of the mission objectives could not be accomplished.
But fortunately it broke at the level of the deployer, the deployer in the cargo bay of the Shuttle, so there was no danger for us of any tether coming back to us by elastic forces on the tether.
So the tether broke, and the satellite and tether obviously went to a higher orbit.
It is as if the satellite and tether had been ejected with a posigrade Î”V to a higher orbit, so it was an unplanned opportunity to verify one dynamic application of a tether system.
If you break the tether, you have, with the exchange of angular momentum, the lower body going to a somewhat lower orbit, and the upper body going to a higher orbit, with the difference of masses of the satellite and the tether attached to it, and of the orbiter, the satellite and tether went to a much higher altitude, and we lost a little bit of energy of our orbit and the orbiter, but it was negligible.
What is interesting is that, after the break, the satellite and tether went to a higher orbit, so it had a longer period, so it started to trail behind us, and four days later we found it again.
The Ground Control team in Houston told us to look in a certain direction after sunrise, and we looked, and we saw that amazing view.
It was about 80 km distance, and we had a bright spot on the top, this was the tethered satellite, and we have the 19.6 km of tether below it, and the tether was absolutely straight, and it was, of course, along the <i>+ Z</i> vector of the LVLH frame attached to the satellite, and it was really a very special view, because the satellite and tether were quite far, 80 km, and the tether is thin, about 3 mm, but there is such a high contrast between the thin tether illuminated by the Sun and the blackness of the background of space that we could see it with the naked eye.
What is interesting also is that, as the satellite and tether had gone to a higher orbit, we had a difference in the nodal regression for that orbit, compared to our orbits, so the satellite and tether, although originally obviously on the same orbit as ours, had come to a somewhat different orbit, because it had had a difference of value of the nodal regression.
We were not in the same orbit when we had that encounter.
But it was an amazing view, and really an amazing demonstration, unplanned demonstration, of dynamic applications of tether, exchange of angular momentum.
So on this reflight of the satellite we had much more success, in fact we could determine the relationship between the voltage on the system and the current all the way until the tether broke, at 19.6 km.
So we learned a lot, but the fact that it was not a total success, although a much better success than the first time we tried, in 1992 on STS-46, it was a proof that it was a difficult technology, and the Italian Space Agency and NASA decided not to continue that.
But as I mentioned before, and as you can see in the reference that I gave you before also, there are a lot of potential applications of tethers.
Here you see a space elevator, but on the side here you have another tether, an enormous number of possible applications.
I'm sure that tethers, either electrodynamic or dynamic tethers, will come back, and I hope that some of you will be able to invent some of the applications of this fantastic system.
