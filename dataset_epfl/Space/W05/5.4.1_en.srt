1
00:00:05,609 --> 00:00:08,259
We're talking about
the reliability of the space systems

2
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:11,809
and we'll touch also
the subject of human rating

3
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:14,709
for human spaceship
like a Space Shuttle.

4
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:16,973
Now a few definitions first.

5
00:00:16,973 --> 00:00:21,233
<i>R(t)</i> is a probability
that the system will not fail

6
00:00:21,233 --> 00:00:23,523
in the interval <i>(0,t)</i>.

7
00:00:23,983 --> 00:00:26,033
And we have two
important concepts.

8
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:29,623
The <i>MTTF</i>, Mean Time To Failure.

9
00:00:29,623 --> 00:00:34,633
It's the time until the first failure
of a given system.

10
00:00:35,144 --> 00:00:38,944
The mean time between failures
is the average time

11
00:00:38,944 --> 00:00:42,084
between two consecutive
failures of a given system.

12
00:00:42,573 --> 00:00:47,903
The failure rate <i>λ(t)</i>
is reciprocal of the <i>MTBF</i>

13
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:50,586
in <i>hours to the power -1</i>

14
00:00:50,586 --> 00:00:53,496
or <i>months to the power -1</i>.

15
00:00:53,994 --> 00:00:57,394
And the probability of failure
<i>λ(t)dt</i> is a probability

16
00:00:57,394 --> 00:01:01,544
that the system will fail
between <i>t</i> and <i>t+dt</i>

17
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:03,884
knowing that it
still works at time <i>t</i>.

18
00:01:05,263 --> 00:01:07,683
Let's do now some
simple development

19
00:01:07,683 --> 00:01:09,503
to find the value of <i>rt</i>,

20
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:11,273
the reliability of time <i>t</i>

21
00:01:11,273 --> 00:01:14,803
as a function of the time
and of the failure rate <i>λ</i>.

22
00:01:15,273 --> 00:01:20,813
Now we'll consider
that <i>λ</i> is a constant

23
00:01:20,813 --> 00:01:23,173
and not depending on time.

24
00:01:23,173 --> 00:01:24,653
Now this is a simplification.

25
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:26,483
It may not be the case always

26
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:29,303
but in this simple development,
that's what we'll assume.

27
00:01:29,303 --> 00:01:33,303
And it's going to be in
<i>hours to the power -1</i>

28
00:01:34,125 --> 00:01:38,525
or possibly <i>years</i>
but <i>hours</i> or <i>months</i>.

29
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:42,902
Let's look at reliability--

30
00:01:44,048 --> 00:01:48,418
at time <i>(t+dt)</i>.

31
00:01:50,198 --> 00:01:54,775
It's going to be equal
to the reliability at <i>(t)</i>

32
00:01:56,755 --> 00:02:02,735
and we factor here <i>[1 - λdt]</i>.

33
00:02:05,217 --> 00:02:09,667
Now this follows from the definition
of these various components.

34
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:11,936
So we can rewrite this

35
00:02:11,936 --> 00:02:18,616
as <i>R(t+dt) - R(t),</i>

36
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,270
time derivative of this
is equal to

37
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:30,070
<i>-R(t) λ</i>

38
00:02:31,097 --> 00:02:33,277
constant <i>λ</i>
not depending on time.

39
00:02:33,812 --> 00:02:34,812
So it follows from that

40
00:02:34,812 --> 00:02:40,513
that <i>R(t)</i>, the reliability of time <i>(t)</i>

41
00:02:42,443 --> 00:02:47,863
is equal to <i>exp (-λt)</i>.

42
00:02:48,473 --> 00:02:50,533
And we'll give an example
in a second.

43
00:02:52,023 --> 00:02:54,223
We saw before that <i>MTBF</i>
of the mean time

44
00:02:54,223 --> 00:02:57,963
between the failures is
the reciprocal of the failure rate.

45
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:02,520
And let's take an example here
where we have <i>MTBF</i>

46
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:05,280
of 30 months, 30 months
on the average

47
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,530
between two failures of a given system.

48
00:03:09,226 --> 00:03:13,226
Following what we have been
developing before,

49
00:03:13,226 --> 00:03:15,476
we have the probability
of the proper functioning

50
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:16,326
of the processor.

51
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:18,076
Let's say the system is a processor.

52
00:03:18,973 --> 00:03:21,503
After two years or 24 months,
it's going to be--

53
00:03:22,244 --> 00:03:27,244
<i>e to the power minus 24 over 30</i>,
which is about <i>0.45</i>.

54
00:03:27,936 --> 00:03:31,746
So again, if we have
this very simple case

55
00:03:31,746 --> 00:03:33,456
where we have one system only

56
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:37,526
and a failure rate
independent of time,

57
00:03:37,532 --> 00:03:40,872
we can determine the probability
that the system is still alive

58
00:03:40,872 --> 00:03:45,292
after a certain time,
or between two given times

59
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,794
in the life of the system.

60
00:03:47,201 --> 00:03:49,071
Now the reality is more complex

61
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:51,871
and I will let you make
further development

62
00:03:51,871 --> 00:03:54,251
if you feel like doing it
or deepen the subject,

63
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:57,221
but that's a a basic
for a relatively simple case.

64
00:03:58,507 --> 00:04:01,517
Now let me say a few words
about human rating.

65
00:04:01,517 --> 00:04:05,107
Obviously if you have
a given spaceship or rocket

66
00:04:05,107 --> 00:04:09,887
like Ariane 5, and it's used
to launch a satellite,

67
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:14,473
and at some point
you want to make it launch

68
00:04:14,473 --> 00:04:19,091
a human spacecraft, like was the plan
a couple of decades ago

69
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:23,518
with ESA that wanted to develop
the so-called Hermes Project.

70
00:04:23,518 --> 00:04:25,758
It would have been
a small manned spaceship

71
00:04:25,758 --> 00:04:27,278
on top of Ariane 5.

72
00:04:27,278 --> 00:04:29,778
It would have been
needed to man rate

73
00:04:29,778 --> 00:04:31,918
the Ariane 5 rockets,
which was not--

74
00:04:31,918 --> 00:04:34,948
which is not now
because Hermes was abandoned

75
00:04:34,948 --> 00:04:38,948
and this effort of man rating
Ariane 5 was not completed.

76
00:04:39,605 --> 00:04:42,255
Let me say a few words
about human rating

77
00:04:42,255 --> 00:04:44,385
of the Space Shuttle,
some of the features

78
00:04:44,385 --> 00:04:48,945
that make it adequate
to carry humans to orbit.

79
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:52,636
There is this principle
of two failure tolerance:

80
00:04:52,636 --> 00:04:53,986
fail operational, fail safe.

81
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:58,706
If you have a system, whether
it's inertial measurement unit

82
00:04:58,706 --> 00:05:01,664
or whether it's a fuel cell
to generate electricity

83
00:05:01,664 --> 00:05:04,384
on board the Shuttle,
you want to have a system

84
00:05:04,384 --> 00:05:08,474
such that if you have one
of a redundant set of systems,

85
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:12,743
one that fails,
you can still do the mission

86
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:16,208
if you have a second
that failed, it can still

87
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:18,708
save the spaceship
and the crew.

88
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:21,428
In fact in the case of the Shuttle
the two were equivalent

89
00:05:21,428 --> 00:05:24,008
because there was no escape
system for the crew.

90
00:05:25,212 --> 00:05:27,682
Two-failure tolerance:
fail operational, fail safe.

91
00:05:27,682 --> 00:05:30,322
One system fail, you are still
okay to do the mission

92
00:05:30,322 --> 00:05:32,762
although you might decide
to maybe shorten it

93
00:05:32,762 --> 00:05:35,522
or do only part of the mission objective.

94
00:05:35,909 --> 00:05:38,529
If you have a second failure
in a redundant set,

95
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:41,065
than you are okay
to save the crew

96
00:05:41,065 --> 00:05:42,525
and save the spaceship.

97
00:05:42,525 --> 00:05:44,545
That's a very important principle.

98
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:47,531
Now another one is
no single crew error

99
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:49,501
will lead to a catastrophic event.

100
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:51,651
A catastrophic event is a loss
of the spaceship

101
00:05:51,651 --> 00:05:52,984
and a loss of the crew.

102
00:05:53,272 --> 00:05:57,272
So the whole system
has to be developed

103
00:05:57,272 --> 00:06:00,102
in the crew interface
with a spaceship

104
00:06:00,102 --> 00:06:04,422
so that this criteria is satisfied.

105
00:06:04,422 --> 00:06:07,323
No single crew error
lead to a catastrophic event.

106
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:11,261
Now obviously, there's quality build
and quality control.

107
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:14,001
There was a lot of quality control
of all of the components

108
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,681
of the Shuttle and during the build
or any modification.

109
00:06:16,966 --> 00:06:20,196
Quality control, I wouldn't say
make it sure that nothing

110
00:06:20,196 --> 00:06:23,406
will happen but at least it reduces
significantly the likelihood

111
00:06:23,406 --> 00:06:26,956
that a human error
in any modification

112
00:06:26,956 --> 00:06:29,796
or in the design will lead to
a catastrophic event.

113
00:06:30,226 --> 00:06:31,766
A lot of inspections also.

114
00:06:32,064 --> 00:06:34,544
And the last item is <i>FMEA</i>,

115
00:06:34,544 --> 00:06:36,364
Failure Modes and Effects Analysis.

116
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:39,024
This is a pretty thick
book at that time

117
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:41,524
because it was not really
on a computer folder.

118
00:06:41,524 --> 00:06:43,294
Now it will be on
a computer folder

119
00:06:43,294 --> 00:06:46,034
but in the early 90s
it was in a book,

120
00:06:46,034 --> 00:06:47,794
Failure Modes
and Effects Analysis.

121
00:06:47,794 --> 00:06:51,334
Engineers looked at
all possible failures

122
00:06:51,334 --> 00:06:54,004
and looking at the effect
of these failures

123
00:06:54,004 --> 00:06:55,514
on the operation
of the Space Shuttle

124
00:06:55,514 --> 00:06:58,754
and the safety of the crew
and of the spaceship itself.

125
00:06:59,157 --> 00:07:04,287
And the idea was to try
to mitigate the danger

126
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:09,517
and try to design one way
to still save ourselves

127
00:07:09,517 --> 00:07:11,297
despite these failures.

128
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,277
So this was a very important effort.

129
00:07:13,277 --> 00:07:19,187
And it is a case for any
major human-rated spaceship.

130
00:07:19,187 --> 00:07:22,259
<i>FMEA</i> is an important document

131
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:25,129
or set of guidelines
and restrictions

132
00:07:25,129 --> 00:07:27,519
that have to be produced
by the designer

133
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:29,709
and the constructor of the vehicle.
