1
00:00:05,882 --> 00:00:09,113
The plans for a Shuttle-based
Tether mission,

2
00:00:09,113 --> 00:00:12,733
a joint project of the Italian
Space Agency and NASA,

3
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:15,147
became more and more
precise and concrete

4
00:00:15,147 --> 00:00:17,353
at the end of the 80s,
of the last century.

5
00:00:18,297 --> 00:00:22,682
The crew was selected in 1990
for a planned mission in 1991.

6
00:00:22,682 --> 00:00:28,282
Eventually we flew in 1992,
as STS-46, the 46th Shuttle mission.

7
00:00:30,834 --> 00:00:35,156
We had a 20 km-long tether
in a deployer system,

8
00:00:35,156 --> 00:00:38,106
on a big drum
in the payload bay of the Shuttle,

9
00:00:38,106 --> 00:00:41,959
and in order to deploy the satellite
at the end of the tether,

10
00:00:41,959 --> 00:00:45,677
but without the possibility of recontact
with any part of the Shuttle,

11
00:00:45,677 --> 00:00:49,153
we had a deployable boom,
at the end of which there was a nest,

12
00:00:49,153 --> 00:00:52,017
the satellite was located on this nest,

13
00:00:52,017 --> 00:00:54,066
and then the initial deployment
was going to be done

14
00:00:54,066 --> 00:00:57,377
by firing small thrusters,
cold gas thrusters

15
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:59,021
in the bottom of the satellite.

16
00:00:59,021 --> 00:01:02,403
It was going to move away
from the Shuttle,

17
00:01:02,403 --> 00:01:05,831
and again, to a distance of 20 km,
a pretty long process.

18
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:11,009
There was a so-called <i>control law</i>,
of 𝑙 dots or the time derivative

19
00:01:11,009 --> 00:01:13,836
of the length, that was
a function of length.

20
00:01:13,836 --> 00:01:17,043
The whole control law
had been loaded in computers,

21
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:21,369
and it was a pretty significant effort

22
00:01:21,369 --> 00:01:24,829
on the part of the Italians
and of NASA to plan this mission.

23
00:01:26,113 --> 00:01:29,294
Again, the orbit characteristics
were 300 km altitude,

24
00:01:29,294 --> 00:01:31,752
so we were well within the ionosphere,

25
00:01:31,752 --> 00:01:37,730
28.5-degree inclination orbit,
to be close to the Equator.

26
00:01:40,845 --> 00:01:45,212
We had communication with the satellite
from the Space Shuttle, S-band,

27
00:01:45,212 --> 00:01:47,146
so we could command the satellite,

28
00:01:47,146 --> 00:01:50,908
we could command thrusters
to change the orientation of the satellite

29
00:01:50,908 --> 00:01:53,619
by keyboard input from the cockpit.

30
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:56,191
And also there were
a lot of scientific data,

31
00:01:56,191 --> 00:02:00,933
electrodynamic scientific data,
that were going to be transmitted

32
00:02:00,933 --> 00:02:03,776
to the orbiter, then to the ground
via this S-band system.

33
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:08,650
In addition, we had a KU-band tracking
of the satellite with a KU-band antenna,

34
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:14,038
which was just behind the starboard
open payload bay door,

35
00:02:14,038 --> 00:02:17,865
so that we could track
the satellite with radar,

36
00:02:17,865 --> 00:02:19,525
so we had an indication of the distance

37
00:02:19,525 --> 00:02:23,298
in addition to the distance
that was provided from the deployer.

38
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:25,586
So here we are.

39
00:02:27,755 --> 00:02:32,950
At the end of 1991, we were fully
in training for this mission,

40
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,987
the seven crew members,

41
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,911
including the first Italian astronaut,
Franco Malerba,

42
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:40,803
and Loren Shriver, a NASA astronaut,
was the Commander of this mission.

43
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,232
One of the big challenges that,
as crew members and also

44
00:02:45,232 --> 00:02:48,570
for the ground team
of the Control Room in Houston,

45
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:52,925
was the possibility
of tether oscillations,

46
00:02:52,925 --> 00:02:56,250
and I'm going to describe
the various types of tether oscillations.

47
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:58,603
Again, this is purely dynamic,
it has nothing to do

48
00:02:58,603 --> 00:03:01,695
with the electrodynamic property,
but only dynamic.

49
00:03:01,695 --> 00:03:04,345
We have the in-plane libration
of the tether.

50
00:03:04,345 --> 00:03:08,588
If you imagine a swinging motion
in-plane of the tether

51
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,703
versus a local vertical.

52
00:03:10,703 --> 00:03:12,762
We have the out-of-plane libration,

53
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:15,890
the same kind of motion, but out of plane.

54
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,644
These were not too much of a problem,

55
00:03:17,644 --> 00:03:23,091
because you imagine that at the time,
in this oscillation motion

56
00:03:23,091 --> 00:03:25,131
you have the tether in the local vertical,

57
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:30,276
you can produce a ΔV
at the level of the orbiter,

58
00:03:30,276 --> 00:03:33,993
in one direction or another,
in order to damp this oscillation.

59
00:03:33,993 --> 00:03:36,454
The longitudinal oscillations
were a little bit trickier,

60
00:03:36,454 --> 00:03:40,414
because you had
the possibility of oscillation

61
00:03:40,414 --> 00:03:42,057
along the direction of the tether.

62
00:03:42,057 --> 00:03:48,141
The tether was basically a Kevlar cable,
about 3 mm in diameter,

63
00:03:48,141 --> 00:03:50,813
with a copper coil
for the conducting elements.

64
00:03:51,532 --> 00:03:54,144
Longitudinal oscillations
were a potential problem,

65
00:03:54,144 --> 00:03:58,796
but worse were really
the so-called <i>skiprope oscillations</i>,

66
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:04,291
you see here you have this rotation motion
of the tether like a skiprope,

67
00:04:04,291 --> 00:04:08,347
or simply, I would say,
the transverse oscillation

68
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:12,762
that was also a possibility,
without going to the skiprope geometry.

69
00:04:15,944 --> 00:04:19,842
And it was really difficult
to think of a way of damping those.

70
00:04:20,425 --> 00:04:22,774
The last one was satellite
pitch &amp; roll oscillations,

71
00:04:22,774 --> 00:04:25,182
we call this the bobbing motion
of the satellite.

72
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:28,295
You can imagine that the satellite

73
00:04:28,295 --> 00:04:33,719
is just swinging in pitch and in roll.

74
00:04:33,719 --> 00:04:38,196
The yaw didn't matter too much,
but in pitch and in roll.

75
00:04:38,196 --> 00:04:40,920
And obviously for such a length
you had a resonance

76
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,627
between these oscillation modes.

77
00:04:43,627 --> 00:04:45,425
Typically there were,
for a certain length,

78
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:49,054
resonance between
the skiprope oscillation frequency,

79
00:04:49,054 --> 00:04:54,348
and the bobbing motion
of the satellite, a frequency,

80
00:04:55,046 --> 00:04:58,646
and there were not too many methods
in order to dampen those.

81
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:00,381
By the way, let's come back

82
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:03,484
to the in-plane libration
and out-of-plane libration.

83
00:05:03,484 --> 00:05:07,016
You can look at the detail of the dynamics

84
00:05:07,016 --> 00:05:09,486
in the reference that I mentioned before,

85
00:05:09,486 --> 00:05:13,284
and we have an interesting property
for long tethers

86
00:05:13,284 --> 00:05:15,428
on orbit around the Earth.

87
00:05:15,428 --> 00:05:21,021
You have the <i>n</i> in plane,

88
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:30,253
which is equal to <i>2 pi</i>
divided by the period in plane,

89
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,210
is equal to the square root of 3

90
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,700
times the <i>n_orbital</i>,

91
00:05:44,708 --> 00:05:50,268
the orbital period,
the orbital frequency, rather,

92
00:05:50,268 --> 00:05:56,019
the time, the period being
in the denominator here, as you can see.

93
00:05:56,528 --> 00:06:00,404
So you can determine, on the basis
of a detailed analysis of the dynamic

94
00:06:00,404 --> 00:06:02,994
that for long tethers
you have this relationship,

95
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:08,683
and in this case, for the out of plane,
we have the <i>n</i> out of plane,

96
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:14,754
equals <i>2 pi</i>,
times the period out of plane

97
00:06:15,623 --> 00:06:18,631
is equal to 2 times the <i>n_orbital</i>.

98
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:24,795
So it's a different period,
a different frequency

99
00:06:24,795 --> 00:06:27,561
of the oscillation
in plane and out of plane.

100
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:29,793
If you want the detail,
you can have a look

101
00:06:29,793 --> 00:06:32,083
at the reference that I mentioned before.

102
00:06:34,538 --> 00:06:38,718
Eureca and TSS-1, STS-46,
the 46th Shuttle mission.

103
00:06:39,037 --> 00:06:42,847
Lift off from Kennedy Space Center,
July the 31st.

104
00:06:43,744 --> 00:06:45,436
There were two objectives in the mission,

105
00:06:45,436 --> 00:06:46,883
and we'll focus only on one of them.

106
00:06:46,883 --> 00:06:49,341
But first we had to deploy
the Eureka platform,

107
00:06:49,341 --> 00:06:53,180
which was a scientific platform
from the European Space Agency,

108
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,781
deployed from the payload bay
of the Shuttle.

109
00:06:55,781 --> 00:06:58,959
It was going to stay on orbit
for about a year,

110
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,742
and be recovered
on a later Shuttle mission.

111
00:07:00,742 --> 00:07:03,914
That picture is interesting,
because it was at about sunrise,

112
00:07:03,914 --> 00:07:06,553
and we're overflying Kennedy Space Center.

113
00:07:06,803 --> 00:07:10,037
We had lifted off a few days earlier
from about this location here,

114
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:11,984
a quite impressive picture.

115
00:07:11,984 --> 00:07:16,749
Now, on the right-hand side
you have what interests us here,

116
00:07:16,749 --> 00:07:19,994
the deployment
of the tether satellite, TSS-1,

117
00:07:19,994 --> 00:07:22,628
and you see the top
of that deployable boom

118
00:07:22,628 --> 00:07:26,282
that we had extended
in the payload bay, about 12 m in size,

119
00:07:26,282 --> 00:07:29,485
and you have the beginning
of the deployment of the satellite,

120
00:07:29,485 --> 00:07:33,274
under the thrust of the small thrusters
in the bottom of the satellite

121
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:36,786
to generate the lift of the satellite
away from the boom.

122
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:40,681
Well, everything went well
until about 200 meters,

123
00:07:40,681 --> 00:07:44,974
when we had suddenly an interruption
of the deployment process.

124
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:49,196
In fact, there was a mechanical problem
in the deployer, such that

125
00:07:49,196 --> 00:07:51,274
the deployment process suddenly stopped.

126
00:07:51,274 --> 00:07:54,598
And you can imagine,
because of the elasticity of the tether,

127
00:07:56,226 --> 00:07:58,209
the satellite came back to us,

128
00:07:58,209 --> 00:08:03,349
because the tether,
after stopping this deployment motion,

129
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:06,795
pulled the satellite back to us,

130
00:08:06,795 --> 00:08:09,862
and we had to work hard
in order to control

131
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:12,572
the orientation
or the attitude of the satellite

132
00:08:12,572 --> 00:08:16,879
so that when the tether
became taut again, in a straight line,

133
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,907
we were not going to start generating
bobbing motion of the satellite.

134
00:08:21,325 --> 00:08:25,409
The Moon was very far away,
400,000 km, no problem with us,

135
00:08:25,409 --> 00:08:27,776
but that was certainly
for us a big challenge.

136
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:33,317
We could still control the system,
and get the retrieval process going,

137
00:08:33,317 --> 00:08:36,263
and we recovered the satellite
and brought it back to Earth.

138
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,203
The Italian Space Agency and NASA
decided to redo the experiments,

139
00:08:42,203 --> 00:08:47,875
because obviously this was only
a very partial success on STS-46.

140
00:08:47,875 --> 00:08:51,121
Still, we had been able to prove
that even with low tension on the tether

141
00:08:51,121 --> 00:08:53,448
we were able to control the satellite.

142
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:55,005
So in this sense we had learned a lot,

143
00:08:55,005 --> 00:08:59,240
but the whole electrodynamic aspect
and generation of electrical power,

144
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:01,386
of course, we had missed completely.

145
00:09:01,386 --> 00:09:05,177
So it was planned to have TSS-1R,

146
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:09,560
R for "repeat," on STS-75,

147
00:09:10,319 --> 00:09:14,228
in February-March 1996,
or about four years later.

148
00:09:15,143 --> 00:09:18,043
And here again you see
the initial deployment of the satellite

149
00:09:18,043 --> 00:09:19,779
from the top of the boom.

150
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:23,685
The small thrusters were located here,
were generating enough inner force

151
00:09:23,685 --> 00:09:26,799
to lift the satellite
away from the basket.

152
00:09:27,477 --> 00:09:29,350
This time we had a successful deployment,

153
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:31,484
nearly to the target of 20 km,

154
00:09:31,484 --> 00:09:34,420
and there was a lot of activity
in the payload bay,

155
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:38,544
and in the cabin, as you can imagine.

156
00:09:38,889 --> 00:09:42,625
Here you have just four
out of the seven crew members,

157
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,521
who are looking through
the overhead windows

158
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:47,111
in the back of the cockpit
of the Space Shuttle

159
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:51,651
using various cameras,
and a laser rangefinder here,

160
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:55,131
and I happen to be here,
also communicating with the ground.

161
00:09:55,131 --> 00:09:57,985
There was a lot of attention
for this amazing deployment

162
00:09:57,985 --> 00:10:01,390
of a very long tether,
on the local vertical,

163
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,641
on top of the Space Shuttle orbiter.

164
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:09,318
And, surely before we reached 20 km,
we had a sudden tether break.

165
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:12,640
That was completely unexpected,
and a big surprise.

166
00:10:13,854 --> 00:10:16,822
You see here,
very shortly after the break--

167
00:10:16,822 --> 00:10:19,525
the break was
at the level of the deployer,

168
00:10:19,525 --> 00:10:24,216
not somewhere in between
the Space Shuttle and the satellite,

169
00:10:24,216 --> 00:10:25,740
or at the level of the satellite,

170
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,518
which, by the way,
would have been dangerous,

171
00:10:27,518 --> 00:10:32,433
because with the elasticity of the tether
it would have come back to us.

172
00:10:32,433 --> 00:10:35,178
But anyway, it was
at the level of the deployer.

173
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:37,354
You see the satellite on top here,

174
00:10:37,354 --> 00:10:40,699
and this is the bottom
of the cut tether,

175
00:10:40,699 --> 00:10:44,997
and the tether break was due
to a short in the system,

176
00:10:44,997 --> 00:10:47,526
and probably a default
in the insulation of the tether

177
00:10:47,526 --> 00:10:52,542
that caused higher currents
between the copper core

178
00:10:52,542 --> 00:10:54,273
and the metallic part of the deployer,

179
00:10:54,273 --> 00:10:57,694
and with a high voltage
and a higher current

180
00:10:57,694 --> 00:11:02,192
the electrical power was such
that it melted the tether,

181
00:11:02,192 --> 00:11:05,330
and it broke, and the satellite
and the tether went away from us.

182
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,480
The reason why we have this coil here,

183
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:10,832
it's just a memory of the tether
that had been around this drum

184
00:11:10,832 --> 00:11:13,095
for a long time before this mission,

185
00:11:13,095 --> 00:11:15,486
for several months before the mission.

186
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:19,672
Well, the tether broke,
and obviously this was unfortunate,

187
00:11:19,672 --> 00:11:22,199
because it meant
that some of the mission objectives

188
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:23,343
could not be accomplished.

189
00:11:23,343 --> 00:11:28,366
But fortunately it broke
at the level of the deployer,

190
00:11:28,366 --> 00:11:30,644
the deployer in the cargo bay
of the Shuttle,

191
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:34,229
so there was no danger for us
of any tether coming back to us

192
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:37,567
by elastic forces on the tether.

193
00:11:38,074 --> 00:11:42,224
So the tether broke,
and the satellite and tether

194
00:11:42,592 --> 00:11:45,272
obviously went to a higher orbit.

195
00:11:45,272 --> 00:11:48,564
It is as if the satellite and tether
had been ejected

196
00:11:48,564 --> 00:11:51,374
with a posigrade ΔV to a higher orbit,

197
00:11:51,374 --> 00:11:54,928
so it was an unplanned opportunity

198
00:11:54,928 --> 00:11:59,607
to verify one dynamic application
of a tether system.

199
00:11:59,607 --> 00:12:03,683
If you break the tether, you have,
with the exchange of angular momentum,

200
00:12:03,683 --> 00:12:06,397
the lower body going
to a somewhat lower orbit,

201
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:08,525
and the upper body going
to a higher orbit,

202
00:12:08,525 --> 00:12:11,822
with the difference of masses
of the satellite

203
00:12:11,822 --> 00:12:14,637
and the tether attached to it,
and of the orbiter,

204
00:12:14,637 --> 00:12:17,627
the satellite and tether went
to a much higher altitude,

205
00:12:17,627 --> 00:12:21,726
and we lost a little bit of energy
of our orbit and the orbiter,

206
00:12:21,726 --> 00:12:23,823
but it was negligible.

207
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:26,753
What is interesting is that,
after the break,

208
00:12:26,753 --> 00:12:30,191
the satellite and tether went
to a higher orbit,

209
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:32,138
so it had a longer period,

210
00:12:32,138 --> 00:12:34,551
so it started to trail behind us,

211
00:12:34,551 --> 00:12:37,476
and four days later we found it again.

212
00:12:37,476 --> 00:12:39,975
The Ground Control team
in Houston told us to look

213
00:12:39,975 --> 00:12:42,561
in a certain direction after sunrise,

214
00:12:42,561 --> 00:12:45,860
and we looked,
and we saw that amazing view.

215
00:12:46,197 --> 00:12:49,143
It was about 80 km distance,

216
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:53,386
and we had a bright spot on the top,

217
00:12:53,386 --> 00:12:55,453
this was the tethered satellite,

218
00:12:55,453 --> 00:13:01,111
and we have the 19.6 km
of tether below it,

219
00:13:01,706 --> 00:13:04,431
and the tether was absolutely straight,

220
00:13:04,431 --> 00:13:08,411
and it was, of course,
along the <i>+ Z</i> vector

221
00:13:08,411 --> 00:13:13,532
of the LVLH frame
attached to the satellite,

222
00:13:13,532 --> 00:13:16,534
and it was really a very special view,

223
00:13:16,534 --> 00:13:20,109
because the satellite
and tether were quite far, 80 km,

224
00:13:20,109 --> 00:13:22,387
and the tether is thin, about 3 mm,

225
00:13:22,387 --> 00:13:24,600
but there is such a high contrast

226
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,323
between the thin tether
illuminated by the Sun

227
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:30,310
and the blackness
of the background of space

228
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,407
that we could see it with the naked eye.

229
00:13:32,407 --> 00:13:36,716
What is interesting also is that,
as the satellite and tether

230
00:13:36,716 --> 00:13:41,303
had gone to a higher orbit,
we had a difference

231
00:13:41,303 --> 00:13:46,808
in the nodal regression for that orbit,
compared to our orbits,

232
00:13:46,808 --> 00:13:50,195
so the satellite and tether,
although originally obviously

233
00:13:50,195 --> 00:13:54,691
on the same orbit as ours,
had come to a somewhat different orbit,

234
00:13:54,691 --> 00:14:00,354
because it had had a difference
of value of the nodal regression.

235
00:14:00,354 --> 00:14:03,625
We were not in the same orbit
when we had that encounter.

236
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,519
But it was an amazing view,

237
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,303
and really an amazing demonstration,
unplanned demonstration,

238
00:14:10,303 --> 00:14:12,315
of dynamic applications of tether,

239
00:14:12,315 --> 00:14:14,368
exchange of angular momentum.

240
00:14:15,504 --> 00:14:18,140
So on this reflight of the satellite
we had much more success,

241
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:20,298
in fact we could determine
the relationship

242
00:14:20,298 --> 00:14:24,276
between the voltage
on the system and the current

243
00:14:24,276 --> 00:14:28,324
all the way until
the tether broke, at 19.6 km.

244
00:14:28,324 --> 00:14:32,788
So we learned a lot, but the fact
that it was not a total success,

245
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:35,871
although a much better success
than the first time we tried,

246
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:38,232
in 1992 on STS-46,

247
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:42,298
it was a proof
that it was a difficult technology,

248
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:45,912
and the Italian Space Agency and NASA
decided not to continue that.

249
00:14:45,912 --> 00:14:48,101
But as I mentioned before,

250
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:51,561
and as you can see in the reference
that I gave you before also,

251
00:14:51,561 --> 00:14:54,194
there are a lot
of potential applications of tethers.

252
00:14:55,516 --> 00:14:57,598
Here you see a space elevator,

253
00:14:57,598 --> 00:15:00,968
but on the side here
you have another tether,

254
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,798
an enormous number
of possible applications.

255
00:15:03,798 --> 00:15:07,948
I'm sure that tethers, either
electrodynamic or dynamic tethers,

256
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:13,234
will come back, and I hope
that some of you will be able to invent

257
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:15,839
some of the applications
of this fantastic system.
