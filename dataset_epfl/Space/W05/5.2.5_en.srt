1
00:00:06,042 --> 00:00:10,001
Let's look at methods
for gyro-based attitude control systems.

2
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:12,453
First, the reaction wheel used on Hubble.

3
00:00:12,459 --> 00:00:16,793
And later, we'll look at CMGs,
or control moment gyros,

4
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:20,159
used on the International Space Station,
the US segment.

5
00:00:20,786 --> 00:00:23,212
A reaction wheel or momentum wheel.

6
00:00:23,667 --> 00:00:25,263
The situation is the following:

7
00:00:25,264 --> 00:00:27,054
we have here the vehicle

8
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,864
and we have a spinning wheel
attached to it.

9
00:00:32,357 --> 00:00:33,693
This is the wheel

10
00:00:35,834 --> 00:00:41,001
spinning with a fixed value of <i>ω</i>,
the angular velocity:

11
00:00:41,193 --> 00:00:42,637
<i>ω</i> wheel.

12
00:00:43,446 --> 00:00:45,594
And it's rotating in this direction.

13
00:00:46,117 --> 00:00:50,887
Its certain value, a pretty high value
of the rotation speed

14
00:00:50,888 --> 00:00:53,688
either in revolutions per minute

15
00:00:53,689 --> 00:00:56,732
or in radians per second.

16
00:00:56,965 --> 00:00:59,549
You need to be careful with the unit
that is being used

17
00:00:59,669 --> 00:01:01,292
and transform accordingly.

18
00:01:01,507 --> 00:01:03,485
Now, if we increase

19
00:01:07,763 --> 00:01:09,896
the angular velocity
of the spinning wheel,

20
00:01:09,897 --> 00:01:12,864
there will be a reaction of the vehicle
in the other direction,

21
00:01:12,865 --> 00:01:15,114
because of the conservation
of angular momentum.

22
00:01:15,234 --> 00:01:19,905
So, let's take the initial value
of the angular speed

23
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:21,949
of the wheel,

24
00:01:22,185 --> 00:01:23,917
and then, at some point,

25
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,729
we increase this value,
and then, we decrease it

26
00:01:28,269 --> 00:01:30,639
from time <i>t_0</i>.

27
00:01:31,584 --> 00:01:34,126
And we put here <i>t_0</i> until the time <i>t_m</i>.

28
00:01:35,621 --> 00:01:39,618
And, this is the <i>ω</i> of the wheel.

29
00:01:40,446 --> 00:01:42,234
So, increasing to a certain value,

30
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:45,443
this is the <i>ω</i> wheel max

31
00:01:48,083 --> 00:01:50,767
equal the angular acceleration

32
00:01:51,876 --> 00:01:53,001
<i>α</i> wheel

33
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,260
times <i>t_m</i> over two.

34
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:59,218
Let's say <i>t_0</i> equals zero here,
it's easier this way.

35
00:02:00,032 --> 00:02:02,149
We have the conservation
of angular momentum,

36
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:06,427
so the total angular momentum
of the complex vehicle plus

37
00:02:07,577 --> 00:02:08,936
reaction wheel

38
00:02:09,405 --> 00:02:12,096
is the following: we have...

39
00:02:12,792 --> 00:02:13,834
<i>I_v</i>

40
00:02:16,251 --> 00:02:18,877
times <i>ω_v</i> plus

41
00:02:20,307 --> 00:02:24,265
<i>I</i> wheel times <i>ω</i> wheel

42
00:02:24,817 --> 00:02:25,910
equal constant.

43
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:32,877
And the <i>I_v</i> is a moment
of inertia of the vehicle.

44
00:02:32,878 --> 00:02:35,794
<i>I_w</i>, moment of inertia of the wheel.

45
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:38,772
So if you take
the time derivative, it's...

46
00:02:41,044 --> 00:02:42,173
<iI_v</i>

47
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,069
<i>α_v</i> plus

48
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,029
<i>I_w</i>,

49
00:02:49,199 --> 00:02:51,249
<i>α_w</i> equal zero.

50
00:02:52,983 --> 00:02:56,020
So it means the angular acceleration
of the vehicle

51
00:02:56,021 --> 00:02:59,513
in reaction to the increase

52
00:02:59,514 --> 00:03:02,723
in the angular velocity of the wheel,

53
00:03:02,724 --> 00:03:04,355
and then of the decrease.

54
00:03:05,231 --> 00:03:07,842
The <i>α</i> vehicle

55
00:03:09,209 --> 00:03:11,699
is always going to be minus

56
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:14,621
the ratio

57
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,941
of the moments of inertia

58
00:03:21,661 --> 00:03:23,742
times <i>α</i> wheel.

59
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:28,446
There's no more room,
so let's go to the next one here.

60
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,981
I'll have to redraw the profile

61
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,665
of <i>ω</i>

62
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:36,909
for the wheel.

63
00:03:39,853 --> 00:03:42,315
<i>t_m</i>, time maneuver,
let's take a zero here.

64
00:03:43,123 --> 00:03:45,826
And this is <i>ω</i> wheel

65
00:03:46,436 --> 00:03:48,126
to a value maximum

66
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,176
of <i>α</i> wheel <i>t_m</i>

67
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:53,386
over two,

68
00:03:53,796 --> 00:03:57,964
and then, I represent here in the bottom,
the reaction of the vehicle

69
00:03:57,965 --> 00:04:01,987
to the increased value of <i>ω</i> wheel,
and then the decrease.

70
00:04:02,452 --> 00:04:03,811
Now, let's have here

71
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:06,241
<i>ω</i> vehicle.

72
00:04:09,473 --> 00:04:11,187
That's the middle point here.

73
00:04:11,188 --> 00:04:12,331
This is <i>t_m</i>.

74
00:04:12,884 --> 00:04:15,092
There will be of course a decrease,

75
00:04:16,192 --> 00:04:17,509
and then an increase:

76
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:19,183
the negative sign.

77
00:04:21,471 --> 00:04:25,817
What is important is
that the value that we have here

78
00:04:27,677 --> 00:04:29,574
for <i>ω</i> vehicle

79
00:04:31,357 --> 00:04:36,455
at the maximum value of the <i>ω</i> wheel
is gonna be equal to...

80
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:38,957
minus

81
00:04:42,182 --> 00:04:43,292
one half

82
00:04:44,459 --> 00:04:48,709
the ratio of the moment of inertias

83
00:04:49,121 --> 00:04:50,115
wheel

84
00:04:51,275 --> 00:04:52,444
and the vehicle

85
00:04:53,747 --> 00:04:54,941
<i>α</i> wheel

86
00:04:56,792 --> 00:04:57,792
<i>t_m</i>.

87
00:05:00,052 --> 00:05:01,281
And now,

88
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:04,650
the angular change of the vehicle,

89
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,834
let's say the <i>Δθ</i>, 

91
00:05:10,245 --> 00:05:12,565
I can write here for the vehicle,

92
00:05:13,406 --> 00:05:15,668
is gonna be equal to this surface here,

93
00:05:16,428 --> 00:05:18,721
is that the integral of the value

94
00:05:20,531 --> 00:05:24,828
of <i>ω</i> vehicle over time
from zero until <i>t_m</i>.

95
00:05:28,843 --> 00:05:30,259
Let's see how to derive that.

96
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,539
That's gonna be...

97
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,415
that surface is gonna be equal to...

98
00:05:36,655 --> 00:05:38,051
let's put a positive sign,

99
00:05:38,052 --> 00:05:41,145
because that's just a value
of the change in angle.

100
00:05:41,146 --> 00:05:46,150
It's gonna be one quarter,
that's the one half that we have here.

101
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,876
But the total triangle has

102
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:53,245
half the surface

103
00:05:53,246 --> 00:05:55,606
of this big rectangle that we have here.

104
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,617
One quarter times,

105
00:06:01,025 --> 00:06:03,804
the ratio of the moments of inertia

106
00:06:09,253 --> 00:06:10,770
<i>α</i> wheel,

107
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,970
<i>t_m</i> square.

108
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:16,472
These are <i>t_m</i> that we have here,

109
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:18,235
plus, of course, the <i>t_m</i>,

110
00:06:18,236 --> 00:06:21,563
the total length
of the base of the triangle.

111
00:06:21,564 --> 00:06:23,706
So this is the value that we have

112
00:06:24,356 --> 00:06:27,376
for a change of angle of the vehicle

113
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:31,689
in reaction to this increase
and then decrease

114
00:06:32,074 --> 00:06:34,321
of the rotation speed
of the reaction wheel.

115
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:42,166
Let's look at the single gimbal
Control Moment Gyroscope or CMG.

116
00:06:42,189 --> 00:06:44,373
Now, the principle
is a little bit different.

117
00:06:45,462 --> 00:06:49,374
Let's go back to the second law
of Newton for rotations.

118
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,792
We have torque

119
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:54,959
equal <i>dL</i>, angular momentum

120
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:57,626
over <i>dt</i>,

121
00:06:58,486 --> 00:07:00,438
and we have

122
00:07:02,459 --> 00:07:03,459
<i>L </i>...

123
00:07:06,895 --> 00:07:10,026
We have a spinning wheel here
with a value of <i>ω</i>.

124
00:07:11,496 --> 00:07:13,218
A rotation in this direction.

125
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:15,039
So this is wheel

126
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,081
on a gimbal,

127
00:07:18,082 --> 00:07:20,670
on the one-axis gimbal here.

128
00:07:21,167 --> 00:07:24,409
So let's put here, the <i>L</i> for the wheel

129
00:07:25,427 --> 00:07:27,264
is equal to

130
00:07:28,054 --> 00:07:31,015
moment of inertia of the wheel times

131
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,853
its angular speed

132
00:07:37,245 --> 00:07:38,960
<i>ω</i> wheel.

133
00:07:42,085 --> 00:07:43,234
Now what is important is

134
00:07:43,354 --> 00:07:46,019
that if we have a torque
on this system here...

135
00:07:48,216 --> 00:07:50,953
So it's going to be a rotation
in this direction

136
00:07:51,501 --> 00:07:53,157
using the right-hand rule.

137
00:07:54,036 --> 00:07:55,508
What is important is

138
00:07:56,918 --> 00:08:00,205
that the time derivative
of the angular momentum of the wheel

139
00:08:00,206 --> 00:08:02,487
is in the same direction as a torque.

140
00:08:03,334 --> 00:08:05,343
So this is of course equal to

141
00:08:06,292 --> 00:08:10,043
<i>ɪ_w</i>, <i>dω</i> wheel

142
00:08:11,596 --> 00:08:12,607
<i>dt</i>.

143
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,034
This is <i>ω</i> wheel.

144
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,020
The torque being in this direction,

145
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:22,976
<i>dω</i>...

146
00:08:24,296 --> 00:08:27,106
wheel over <i>dt</i>

147
00:08:27,616 --> 00:08:29,413
will be in the same direction.

148
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:35,721
So you see that this will change
the orientation of the spinning wheel,

149
00:08:37,493 --> 00:08:41,217
which is represented here
in this vector upwards

150
00:08:43,745 --> 00:08:45,052
in this direction.

151
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:47,762
So we apply torque here,

152
00:08:47,763 --> 00:08:53,626
which is basically an attempt
to rotate the base of the gyroscope,

153
00:08:53,635 --> 00:08:58,304
the single gimbal-based gyroscope
in this orientation,

154
00:08:58,619 --> 00:09:04,928
and the reaction will be a rotation
in this direction of the spinning wheel.

155
00:09:05,468 --> 00:09:06,713
It's important to realize

156
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:10,558
that the spin angular momentum
is always in the direction of the torque.

157
00:09:10,796 --> 00:09:13,017
The torque is over there,

158
00:09:13,367 --> 00:09:16,937
and the change in the <i>ω</i> wheel
is in the same direction,

159
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:19,622
causing the rotation that we talked about.

160
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:21,790
Now, the same principle is used

161
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,710
for the ISS attitude control system
on the US segment.

162
00:09:28,029 --> 00:09:30,413
If you have the ISS in general

163
00:09:34,183 --> 00:09:38,544
with the cluster of module,
then we have the sidebar

164
00:09:38,545 --> 00:09:40,557
with the solar rays at the end.

165
00:09:42,876 --> 00:09:44,377
We know this is a <i>X</i>,

166
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:49,043
and this is going to be <i>Y</i> and <i>Z</i>.

167
00:09:51,596 --> 00:09:55,565
The Russian segment is in the aft
of the International Space Station;

168
00:09:55,566 --> 00:09:58,136
the US segment is in the forward portion,

169
00:09:58,137 --> 00:10:00,253
and this is the Russian segment.

170
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:09,304
It has attitude control with thrusters,
and this is a US segment.

171
00:10:09,794 --> 00:10:11,739
It's using CMGs,

172
00:10:14,721 --> 00:10:16,920
which are represented in the lower left.

173
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:18,594
You see the four CMGs;

174
00:10:19,014 --> 00:10:20,678
there's some redundancy there.

175
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:23,704
You have four; three would be needed,
but there are four.

176
00:10:26,308 --> 00:10:28,864
The ISS CMG reorientation of the wheels

177
00:10:28,865 --> 00:10:31,375
causes torque
on the ISS and attitude control.

178
00:10:31,376 --> 00:10:33,883
It's good to have a double system

179
00:10:33,884 --> 00:10:36,922
with the thrusters in the back
and the CMGs in the front,

180
00:10:36,923 --> 00:10:40,052
because using CMGs
doesn't use any propellant,

181
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:43,670
it uses electrical power generated
by the solar rays,

182
00:10:43,671 --> 00:10:45,901
but sometimes you have
saturation of the gyros,

183
00:10:45,902 --> 00:10:47,520
and in order to unsaturate them,

184
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:51,454
you have to use the Russian segment,
thruster bay's attitude control system,

185
00:10:51,455 --> 00:10:53,513
then you can unsaturate them,

186
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:57,844
so it's quite a nice system
to have both components:

187
00:10:58,474 --> 00:11:02,829
CMG and thruster bay's
attitude control system on ISS.
