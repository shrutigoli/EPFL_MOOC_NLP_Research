Hello everyone and welcome to Unit 5:
Selected Spacecraft Systems.
This week we'll talk about attitude control, electrical power generation, classical and alternative methods, reliability of space systems.
Here you see a nice view of one of the wings of the International
Space Station solar arrays.
There are eight such wings, and each of the wings, like you see here, is providing more than 10 kilowatts of electrical power to the International Space Station considering the size of the array and the efficiency of the solar cells.
Now we have prepared some practice quizzes after each video to make sure that you understand the concepts explained in these videos.
Each section from 5.2 to 5.4 is concluded by a control quiz.
In addition, there is a test at the end of the unit.
To illustrate this unit, we have prepared a focus on Hayabusa with an interview of Hitoshi Kuninaka from JAXA.
Looking at this is not compulsory.
It's facultative, but we encourage you to do it in order to deepen your knowledge about this particular subject.
