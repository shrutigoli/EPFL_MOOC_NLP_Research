1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,847
Let's talk about
the methods of attitude control.

2
00:00:07,847 --> 00:00:10,803
Some of them are passive,
or relatively passive,

3
00:00:10,803 --> 00:00:16,049
others require active action,

4
00:00:16,049 --> 00:00:19,404
like thrusters, or spinning wheels,
or things like this,

5
00:00:19,404 --> 00:00:22,904
but let's talk about the first one,
gravity gradient, and this is passive.

6
00:00:22,904 --> 00:00:26,047
If you have an elongated object,
like a pencil,

7
00:00:26,047 --> 00:00:28,796
or, let's say,
a larger object, like a rod,

8
00:00:28,796 --> 00:00:32,646
it will take an orientation
in orbit around the Earth

9
00:00:32,646 --> 00:00:35,249
such that the long axis
of this elongated object

10
00:00:35,249 --> 00:00:37,449
will be along the local vertical,

11
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:43,352
with, possibly, some swinging motion,
or attitude changes,

12
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:46,502
around the local vertical
gravity gradients.

13
00:00:46,502 --> 00:00:49,002
With magnetic torquers,
and this is only valid

14
00:00:49,002 --> 00:00:54,551
if you are on orbit around a planet
that has a magnetic field,

15
00:00:54,551 --> 00:00:58,203
you can have a spinning spacecraft
using the gyroscopic effect

16
00:00:58,203 --> 00:01:01,496
to maintain a certain orientation
around one axis,

17
00:01:01,496 --> 00:01:03,501
spinning the spacecraft.

18
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:06,446
Then we'll come to
a little fancier attitude control system

19
00:01:06,446 --> 00:01:08,451
with momentum devices:
reaction wheels,

20
00:01:08,451 --> 00:01:13,602
or Control Momentum Gyros,
and the last one very much used,

21
00:01:13,602 --> 00:01:15,998
whether it's for the Space Shuttle
in the past,

22
00:01:15,998 --> 00:01:20,755
or the Russian segment of the
International Space Station thrusters.

23
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:24,201
Gravity gradient, very simple,
again, an elongated object,

24
00:01:24,201 --> 00:01:27,648
and you have to imagine
that if you have the Earth down,

25
00:01:27,648 --> 00:01:32,598
with the horizon pretty much horizontal
on this drawing,

26
00:01:32,598 --> 00:01:35,202
the force on the bottom
of this elongated object

27
00:01:35,202 --> 00:01:38,101
will be somewhat larger,
even slightly larger,

28
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:43,351
than the force on the top,
and if you project these force vectors

29
00:01:43,351 --> 00:01:46,603
on a line perpendicular to the axis
of the elongated object,

30
00:01:46,603 --> 00:01:48,602
you see that there is a torque
on this object

31
00:01:48,602 --> 00:01:52,651
such that it will tend to come back
to the local vertical

32
00:01:52,651 --> 00:01:56,698
but, again, there can be oscillations
around the local vertical

33
00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:58,645
but, on the average,
this elongated object

34
00:01:58,645 --> 00:02:02,300
will keep an orientation
along the local vertical,

35
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,445
and we'll see later,
with the space tethers,

36
00:02:04,445 --> 00:02:07,802
if you have two object
that are linked with a cable,

37
00:02:07,802 --> 00:02:09,296
pretty long cable,

38
00:02:09,296 --> 00:02:13,753
the cable will always take
an orientation along the local vertical,

39
00:02:13,753 --> 00:02:17,901
plus, possibly,
oscillations in plane and out of plane.

40
00:02:17,901 --> 00:02:20,102
Let's talk about magnetic torquers.

41
00:02:20,102 --> 00:02:23,598
They are used
if you need an orientation to space track

42
00:02:23,598 --> 00:02:25,154
which is not extremely precise

43
00:02:25,154 --> 00:02:28,903
but, more often,
they are used as a system

44
00:02:28,903 --> 00:02:32,353
to desaturate momentum gyros,
we'll see this later,

45
00:02:32,353 --> 00:02:38,697
but imagine that you have a coil
with an electric current, I,

46
00:02:38,697 --> 00:02:40,845
and, of course,
it will generate a magnetic field,

47
00:02:40,845 --> 00:02:45,549
but, in general,
we use the term magnetic moment,

48
00:02:45,549 --> 00:02:48,247
magnetic moment
would be in this direction here,

49
00:02:48,247 --> 00:02:51,999
and the amplitude
of the magnetic moment

50
00:02:51,999 --> 00:02:56,300
is going to be equal to
the number of coils to the current,

51
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:00,996
and to the area of each of the coils.

52
00:03:00,996 --> 00:03:03,152
Now you have an interaction
of this magnetic moment

53
00:03:03,152 --> 00:03:05,152
with the magnetic field
that's represented here,

54
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:08,902
the magnetic field, B,
and you have an angle, Î¸,

55
00:03:08,902 --> 00:03:13,701
between the magnetic moment,
vector magnetic moment of magnetic field,

56
00:03:13,701 --> 00:03:17,403
and there you are going to have a torque
on that magnet torquer,

57
00:03:17,403 --> 00:03:20,600
which is given by this value here,

58
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:24,600
basically, the magnetic moment amplitude

59
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:27,151
times the amplitude
of the magnetic fields

60
00:03:27,151 --> 00:03:33,796
and the sine of the angle
between these two vectors, B and Î¼,

61
00:03:33,796 --> 00:03:37,750
and, again, either use for loose,
I would say,

62
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:42,399
relatively loose, attitude control,
or for desaturating momentum gyros,

63
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:44,713
which we'll talk about later.

64
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:46,754
You can use these also
for very small satellite.

65
00:03:46,754 --> 00:03:50,352
There are a few CubeSats, for instance,
very, very small satellite,

66
00:03:50,352 --> 00:03:55,647
normally academic-generated
small spacecraft

67
00:03:55,647 --> 00:04:00,150
designed by students,
that use magnet torquer bars

68
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:02,345
to orient the spacecraft.

69
00:04:02,345 --> 00:04:04,097
The Hubble Space Telescope
needs, of course,

70
00:04:04,097 --> 00:04:07,504
a very accurate attitude control system

71
00:04:07,504 --> 00:04:10,000
because it's pointing to
a celestial object,

72
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,798
and takes pictures of celestial objects
with very high accuracy,

73
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:18,599
and very high resolution,
and it uses momentum wheels,

74
00:04:18,599 --> 00:04:21,498
and we'll talk about that later,
but it also has,

75
00:04:21,498 --> 00:04:24,802
on the side of the optical part
of the telescope,

76
00:04:24,802 --> 00:04:29,754
this is the optical part of the telescope,
this is the instrument part,

77
00:04:29,754 --> 00:04:34,448
and here you see
two out of four magnet torquer bars.

78
00:04:34,448 --> 00:04:38,795
The orientation of the telescope
is via momentum wheels,

79
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:43,505
but sometimes we need to desaturate them
using the magnet torquer bars.

80
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:45,804
This is a view
of the Hubble Space Telescope

81
00:04:45,804 --> 00:04:50,104
during the first servicing mission,
in December '93,

82
00:04:50,104 --> 00:04:53,553
on the fifth out of five space walks,
and quite a nice picture

83
00:04:53,553 --> 00:04:56,246
where you see the Space Shuttle
payload bay,

84
00:04:56,246 --> 00:05:01,999
in the back of the payload bay, a platform
on which the telescope is located,

85
00:05:01,999 --> 00:05:05,504
and, at that time,
we were changing the solar array.

86
00:05:05,504 --> 00:05:07,204
The solar arrays
are against the telescope,

87
00:05:07,204 --> 00:05:09,002
not yet deployed,

88
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:11,545
but what you see here
are also the magnet torquer bars,

89
00:05:11,545 --> 00:05:14,995
and here they are, one of them,
and another one of them here.

90
00:05:14,995 --> 00:05:17,847
There are four total; the other ones
are on the other side of the telescope.

91
00:05:17,847 --> 00:05:21,552
On the background,
you see Australia upside down.

92
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:23,601
We talked about the two methods so far.

93
00:05:23,601 --> 00:05:28,798
We have gravity gradient,
and the use of magnet torquer bars.

94
00:05:28,798 --> 00:05:32,846
Another really rudimentary method
of attitude control

95
00:05:32,846 --> 00:05:34,551
is a spinning spacecraft.

96
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:38,553
Imagine you have a spacecraft,
pretty much like a cylinder,

97
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:41,204
and you wanted to keep
a certain orientation

98
00:05:41,204 --> 00:05:45,198
versus inertial space,
we talk about inertial space here,

99
00:05:45,198 --> 00:05:50,054
and the side of the cylinder
is covered with solar panels,

100
00:05:50,054 --> 00:05:56,404
and the axis of rotation is oriented
perpendicular to the direction of the Sun,

101
00:05:56,404 --> 00:05:58,800
so the solar panels
are always illuminated by the Sun

102
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,854
and generating electricity.

103
00:06:00,854 --> 00:06:04,351
Early communication satellite
had this kind of attitude control.

104
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:07,946
It's no longer used now,
but it was in the past.

105
00:06:07,946 --> 00:06:12,596
What you want now, in most cases,
is a three axis stabilized spacecraft.

106
00:06:12,596 --> 00:06:16,303
Here is a spacecraft
in the vicinity of a planet,

107
00:06:16,303 --> 00:06:20,796
target planet, whether it's Mars,
or Jupiter, Saturn, any planet,

108
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:25,648
and you need, on one hand,
to have solar arrays oriented to the Sun,

109
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:28,046
you will want to have
some instrument or cameras

110
00:06:28,046 --> 00:06:32,154
oriented to the planet
that you are studying,

111
00:06:32,154 --> 00:06:34,097
and you want to have
communication with the Earth,

112
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:37,654
either to send signal to the spacecraft
or receive the data,

113
00:06:37,654 --> 00:06:41,503
so if you have all of these appendages
that have to have a certain orientation,

114
00:06:41,503 --> 00:06:46,302
you need a three axis control
of the attitude of the spacecraft.

115
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:51,529
You want to control it in pitch,
in yaw, and in roll, all three.
