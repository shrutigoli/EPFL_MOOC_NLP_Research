00:00:04,829 --> 00:00:06,829
We hope that you enjoyed
this week with us.

2
00:00:06,829 --> 00:00:09,279
Thank you 
for your participation in the course.

3
00:00:10,492 --> 00:00:12,462
I would like you to focus

4
00:00:12,462 --> 00:00:15,302
on the concepts presented in this unit.

5
00:00:15,302 --> 00:00:17,872
Once these concepts
are clearly understood,

6
00:00:17,872 --> 00:00:19,342
including their application,

7
00:00:19,342 --> 00:00:21,572
you can take 
the final test of the unit.

8
00:00:22,079 --> 00:00:25,649
We'd like to remind you 
of the focus on Hayabusa

9
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:29,279
with the interview
of Hitoshi Kuninaka from JAXA.

10
00:00:30,297 --> 00:00:33,807
Hayabusa is an unmanned
spacecraft developed by JAXA

11
00:00:33,807 --> 00:00:39,507
to return a sample of material
from a small near-Earth asteroid,

12
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,540
25143, and named Itokawa.

13
00:00:44,366 --> 00:00:46,986
The spacecraft was launched in 2003.

14
00:00:46,986 --> 00:00:49,786
It made a rendezvous
with Itokawa in 2005.

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,520
The collected samples
were returned to Earth in 2010.
