1
00:00:05,417 --> 00:00:06,490
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,491 --> 00:00:09,064
Today we'll talk about
electrical power source

3
00:00:09,065 --> 00:00:11,040
for various spacecraft.

4
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:15,445
On this first diagram,
you see the kind of value

5
00:00:15,446 --> 00:00:17,583
that you have for different spacecraft.

6
00:00:17,893 --> 00:00:20,465
It doesn't go really
in the historical sense

7
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:22,044
from the top to the bottom,

8
00:00:22,045 --> 00:00:25,709
but right now you still have CubeSat
that have very low power.

9
00:00:25,717 --> 00:00:27,363
But it gives you the range.

10
00:00:27,973 --> 00:00:34,345
On the horizontal axis
you have the power in watts.

11
00:00:34,971 --> 00:00:40,261
And this is a log scale
of the values here,

12
00:00:40,651 --> 00:00:47,034
0.1 10 1000 and 100,000 here.

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,356
So, note that this is on a log scale.

14
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:54,864
Values to look at are for instance,
for the CubeSats

15
00:00:54,865 --> 00:00:56,336
which are quite common now,

16
00:00:56,337 --> 00:00:58,020
it's typically a few watts.

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:00,572
The International Space Station,

18
00:01:00,573 --> 00:01:07,473
with the big four solar arrays
that it has at the end of a sided truss

19
00:01:07,474 --> 00:01:10,627
generates on the average 84 kilowatts.

20
00:01:10,964 --> 00:01:13,082
This is an average between day and night,

21
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,619
of course, you have eclipse
about a third of the time.

22
00:01:17,057 --> 00:01:19,987
At any given time, they produce
quite a bit more than that,

23
00:01:19,988 --> 00:01:22,267
but that's average value over the day.

24
00:01:22,677 --> 00:01:26,043
Other values to note are
Hubble, 2.4 kilowatts,

25
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:30,865
and the Space Shuttle had three fuel cells
generating each about 7 kilowatts

26
00:01:30,866 --> 00:01:32,699
for a maximum of 21.

27
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,422
Although most of the time
we're using about two-thirds of that.

28
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:41,029
Here we have the operating regimes
of spacecraft power sources

29
00:01:41,042 --> 00:01:45,417
just to see what kind of power source
you need for different utilizations.

30
00:01:47,157 --> 00:01:49,933
You have the duration of the mission
on the horizontal axis,

31
00:01:50,053 --> 00:01:54,626
and the electrical power in watts
on the vertical axis

32
00:01:54,627 --> 00:01:58,497
with values of 1 kilowatt
here, 10 kilowatts.

33
00:01:58,847 --> 00:02:02,249
And you see if you have a mission
with a short duration

34
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:06,115
you need no more 
than about 1 kilowatt--batteries are fine.

35
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:10,774
If you want quite a bit more power

36
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:13,790
and for one reason or another
you don't want to use solar arrays

37
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:17,459
and quite a longer duration--
fuel cells are fine.

38
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,892
I will give you some examples of that.

39
00:02:19,893 --> 00:02:22,001
Solar arrays are widely used obviously,

40
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:27,453
as a power source for long duration
and pretty high values of power.

41
00:02:27,853 --> 00:02:31,073
Nuclear reactors which you see here
are really not used now,

42
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:34,062
it's kind of a dream,
but it hasn't been used so far.

43
00:02:34,063 --> 00:02:38,692
And for spacecraft that need long duration
and not too much power,

44
00:02:38,693 --> 00:02:42,833
and especially the ones
that are sent far away in the Solar System

45
00:02:42,834 --> 00:02:45,498
when solar arrays
cannot be used efficiently,

46
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:46,732
we use RTGs,

47
00:02:46,733 --> 00:02:50,894
or radioisotope
thermal electric generators.

48
00:02:51,403 --> 00:02:54,647
Now, just for information,
the Space Shuttle was about here.

49
00:02:54,648 --> 00:02:58,496
It was typically
a one or two week operation,

50
00:02:58,497 --> 00:03:01,962
and I mentioned already, 21 kilowatts.

51
00:03:01,963 --> 00:03:04,828
The International Space Station
of course, in terms of time,

52
00:03:04,829 --> 00:03:09,541
it's very long time, and is 84 kilowatts,
so it's about at this level.

53
00:03:09,542 --> 00:03:11,917
So, ISS solar arrays,

54
00:03:12,981 --> 00:03:15,440
Space Shuttle was in
the area of fuel cells,

55
00:03:15,441 --> 00:03:17,991
and that was used on the Shuttle.

56
00:03:17,992 --> 00:03:19,590
No solar arrays on the Shuttle

57
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:23,750
because we needed to have the flexibility
of maneuvering the spaceship,

58
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:25,834
and obviously, if you have solar arrays,

59
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:29,666
you have a complication
with the orientation of the solar arrays

60
00:03:29,667 --> 00:03:31,833
versus the body of the spacecraft.

61
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:37,958
Solar energy, obviously, very widely used
for space stations in particular

62
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:40,572
and many spacecraft
on orbit around the Earth

63
00:03:40,573 --> 00:03:42,677
because we're close enough to the Sun

64
00:03:42,677 --> 00:03:46,234
with the 1.4 kilowatt 
per square meter solar constant.

65
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:50,171
Valid also for spacecraft that go
in the Solar System but not too, too far.

66
00:03:50,172 --> 00:03:52,252
If you want to go to Pluto or beyond,

67
00:03:52,253 --> 00:03:55,874
or Voyager I and II that are coming
outside of the Solar System,

68
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:58,172
obviously, you can't use solar arrays.

69
00:03:58,372 --> 00:04:01,030
The principle is well known:
you have the Sun,

70
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:05,477
you have solar panels generating
electricity out of the radiation power

71
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:06,747
from the Sun.

72
00:04:06,897 --> 00:04:10,247
You have a charge controller
that will distribute the electrical energy

73
00:04:10,367 --> 00:04:13,708
generated by the solar arrays
either to the batteries to load them,

74
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,382
so that we are ready
for the orbital night,

75
00:04:16,384 --> 00:04:18,478
and also to power subsystems,

76
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,206
So there is a distribution
of the electrical power

77
00:04:22,207 --> 00:04:23,928
in these two branches.

78
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:28,003
And of course, if we are in eclipse,
not illuminated by the Sun,

79
00:04:28,004 --> 00:04:31,473
then the batteries are providing
power to the subsystems.

80
00:04:32,023 --> 00:04:34,060
Now, this is an important diagram here.

81
00:04:34,061 --> 00:04:36,797
You see the definition
of the beta angle.

82
00:04:36,798 --> 00:04:42,166
The beta angle is the angle
for spacecraft on orbit around the Earth

83
00:04:42,167 --> 00:04:45,834
between the plane of the orbit
and the direction of the Sun.

84
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:50,529
If you have a beta angle of zero,
the Sun is in the plane of the orbit.

85
00:04:51,049 --> 00:04:54,212
So you'll be for a while
illuminated by the Sun,

86
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:55,802
and then you come in the shadow.

87
00:04:55,803 --> 00:04:58,663
If you have a beta angle of 90 degrees,

88
00:04:58,664 --> 00:05:01,563
you are flying over the determinator,

89
00:05:01,564 --> 00:05:04,866
in a way, the limit day and night
of the surface of the Earth;

90
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:07,855
in this case, you'll be
constantly illuminated by the Sun.

91
00:05:08,235 --> 00:05:14,023
So, in terms of planning
for the electrical power generator

92
00:05:14,024 --> 00:05:18,255
for a spacecraft, you need
to consider the beta angle

93
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:20,840
and in fact, the beta angle
is changing all the time.

94
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,153
For the International Space Station
for instance, the beta angle is changing

95
00:05:25,154 --> 00:05:27,926
because you have
the precession of the orbit,

96
00:05:27,927 --> 00:05:31,272
you have seasonal changes,
so that the angle is changing.

97
00:05:31,273 --> 00:05:35,851
But that's an important parameter
in terms of the capability to store energy

98
00:05:35,852 --> 00:05:38,551
during the orbital day,
and use it during the night.

99
00:05:40,161 --> 00:05:44,108
Let's look at the principle
of functioning of solar cells.

100
00:05:44,292 --> 00:05:48,384
Here you have silicon,
you have an n-type silicon,

101
00:05:48,384 --> 00:05:49,784
you have a junction,

102
00:05:49,792 --> 00:05:51,917
and then p-type silicon at the bottom.

103
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:54,286
And generally, you have a semiconductor

104
00:05:54,286 --> 00:05:58,735
with N doping on the top
and P doping at the bottom.

105
00:05:58,736 --> 00:06:02,312
When the solar cell
is illuminated by the Sun,

106
00:06:02,313 --> 00:06:06,589
you have a motion
of electrons from N to P

107
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,482
and holes from P to N
generating electricity.

108
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:13,416
So this is an overall principle.

109
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:17,943
And cell types, you have
a silicon-based solar cell

110
00:06:17,944 --> 00:06:20,863
which is very common,
not extremely efficient.

111
00:06:20,863 --> 00:06:25,249
You get to values of 15 to 22 %

112
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:30,713
for the highest efficiency
silicon solar cells.

113
00:06:31,123 --> 00:06:34,477
A widely used type
is a gallium arsenide.

114
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:37,407
You have for instance,
the Hubble Space Telescope solar arrays

115
00:06:37,408 --> 00:06:40,510
that are equipped
with gallium arsenide cells

116
00:06:40,511 --> 00:06:45,030
with a quite a bit high efficiency of 30%,

117
00:06:45,031 --> 00:06:46,541
but a higher cost also.

118
00:06:47,654 --> 00:06:49,239
Here we have some drawings

119
00:06:49,239 --> 00:06:52,475
about the type of geometry
of the solar cells,

120
00:06:52,476 --> 00:06:56,897
and for the deployment
a rigid foldout panels that are unfolding.

121
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,834
You have the flex rollouts.

122
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,917
Here you have 
another type of flex rollout

123
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:07,567
radially away from the axis
of the spacecraft.

124
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:12,131
And here you have a flex foldout
with a mechanical structure

125
00:07:12,132 --> 00:07:14,664
that will extend the wings
of the solar array.

126
00:07:15,634 --> 00:07:18,341
This one here is the type of solar array

127
00:07:18,342 --> 00:07:22,472
that was used originally
for the Hubble Space Telescope

128
00:07:22,473 --> 00:07:27,782
built in Europe by British Aerospace
in Bristol, United Kingdom.

129
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:32,375
You have two bistem cassettes.

130
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:39,959
They were deploying semi-rigid bistems

131
00:07:39,974 --> 00:07:44,142
pretty much like a metallic tape measure

132
00:07:44,143 --> 00:07:47,135
that has a curvature
and gives it a sort of rigidity.

133
00:07:47,536 --> 00:07:50,267
And here you see the bistem
being deployed on both sides

134
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:54,848
and on the other side of the wings
of the solar array also.

135
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:58,314
And the consequence
of this semi-rigid system

136
00:07:58,315 --> 00:08:02,161
is that the original solar arrays
of Hubble were not actually flat.

137
00:08:02,162 --> 00:08:08,497
They had this slight deformation
as you see on the upper right picture.

138
00:08:08,498 --> 00:08:09,692
It worked fine.

139
00:08:09,693 --> 00:08:14,242
Again, if you have a small deviation
versus the perfect angle of exposure

140
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:18,282
of the solar array to the Sun
like 5-10 degrees, it's not a problem.

141
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:22,202
Batteries: types and characteristics.

142
00:08:22,512 --> 00:08:26,221
Obviously, all of the batteries
used in spacecraft

143
00:08:26,222 --> 00:08:28,651
have to be rechargeable batteries.

144
00:08:28,652 --> 00:08:32,746
They are typically used during the eclipse
or in orbit around the Earth,

145
00:08:32,746 --> 00:08:35,244
and then when we are exposed to the Sun,

146
00:08:35,244 --> 00:08:38,796
they are being recharged
using typically the solar arrays.

147
00:08:39,023 --> 00:08:44,066
Originally, we had a lot of use
of the Nickel Cadmium batteries

148
00:08:44,067 --> 00:08:46,599
until about the year 2000.

149
00:08:46,931 --> 00:08:50,371
They have been widely replaced
by the Lithium Ion batteries

150
00:08:50,372 --> 00:08:55,099
with a much better specific energy,
about 150 watt-hour per kilogram.

151
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:00,487
The original Nickel Cadmium 
specific energy was about 50 to 60,

152
00:09:00,488 --> 00:09:01,617
no more.

153
00:09:02,338 --> 00:09:07,846
Now, a type of battery that is used
when we need a very long duration

154
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:11,346
--typically, it's the case
for the Hubble Space Telescope

155
00:09:11,347 --> 00:09:13,942
which has been
for more than 25 years in orbit

156
00:09:13,943 --> 00:09:16,616
and also the International Space Station
about 12 years--

157
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:19,662
it's the Nickel Hydrogen battery.

158
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,866
The efficiency is somewhat less
than the Lithium Ion;

159
00:09:22,867 --> 00:09:27,140
typically, also of the order
of 50 to 60 watt-hour per kilogram,

160
00:09:27,141 --> 00:09:31,948
but they can take a very large number
of charge and discharge cycles;

161
00:09:31,949 --> 00:09:34,736
here up to 20,000.

162
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:38,257
Fuel cells are used

163
00:09:38,257 --> 00:09:42,632
whenever the utilization 
of solar arrays is not adequate.

164
00:09:42,633 --> 00:09:45,074
For instance, if you go
far away in the Solar System

165
00:09:45,074 --> 00:09:47,991
or for other reasons,
like on the surface of Mars,

166
00:09:47,992 --> 00:09:51,326
where deposition of dust
on the solar arrays

167
00:09:51,327 --> 00:09:54,081
reduces the efficiency over time.

168
00:09:54,082 --> 00:09:57,286
On the left-hand side, you have
the principle of the fuel cell.

169
00:09:57,287 --> 00:10:01,423
You have hydrogen from the left
and oxygen from the right,

170
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:05,005
through respectively,
anode and cathode with electrolytes.

171
00:10:05,289 --> 00:10:09,299
Then you have hydrogen ions migrating
from the anode to the cathode

172
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,254
and generating electricity.

173
00:10:11,804 --> 00:10:15,160
You need the constant flow
of oxygen and hydrogen

174
00:10:15,161 --> 00:10:18,655
so the fuel cells,
as opposed to normal batteries,

175
00:10:18,655 --> 00:10:22,724
are using a flow of reactants
in order to generate the electrical power.

176
00:10:23,032 --> 00:10:26,874
The by-products, as we can see,
are water and heat.

177
00:10:27,078 --> 00:10:31,087
In the case of the Space Shuttle
that was equipped with three fuel cells,

178
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,315
the water was obviously,
used for cooling components;

179
00:10:34,316 --> 00:10:35,629
it was used by the crew;

180
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,835
and for heat re-hydration
of the food also.

181
00:10:37,848 --> 00:10:40,222
And the heat was also used.

182
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:43,279
So, in any spacecraft system,

183
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,080
you try to use whatever you can
from any given system.

184
00:10:46,081 --> 00:10:47,698
Here you generate electricity,

185
00:10:47,699 --> 00:10:51,023
you generate water that you use,
and heat that you use also.

186
00:10:51,473 --> 00:10:54,868
On the right-hand side, you see
one of three Shuttle fuel cells.

187
00:10:54,869 --> 00:10:59,407
Each of them was generating
about 7 kilowatts of electrical power

188
00:10:59,408 --> 00:11:02,578
for a grand total of 21 kilowatts.

189
00:11:04,454 --> 00:11:10,705
Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generators,
RTGs, are used mainly in spacecraft

190
00:11:10,706 --> 00:11:12,800
for the exploration of the Solar System.

191
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:16,418
The idea is to use a radioactive material

192
00:11:16,529 --> 00:11:20,106
such as plutonium-238 generating heat.

193
00:11:21,368 --> 00:11:24,493
The heat is converted
into electricity by <i>thermocouples</i>.

194
00:11:24,494 --> 00:11:27,418
So you need to have
really a hot component

195
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:32,826
which is the fuel itself,
the radioactive fuel,

196
00:11:32,827 --> 00:11:34,985
and you have to have a cold component

197
00:11:34,986 --> 00:11:37,705
so that you can have
a thermocouple effect.

198
00:11:37,706 --> 00:11:41,003
On the left-hand side,
you have the Viking spacecraft

199
00:11:41,007 --> 00:11:43,953
which was on the surface of Mars
in the middle of the 70s

200
00:11:44,504 --> 00:11:50,763
with radioisotope fuel here,
which is in the core of the system.

201
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:54,707
And then the outside
was really the cold component

202
00:11:56,738 --> 00:12:00,905
with the wings that were dissipating
heat in the outside

203
00:12:00,906 --> 00:12:03,098
so the outside was the cold part

204
00:12:03,099 --> 00:12:07,483
and the inside obviously,
with the plutonium-238 was a hot part.

205
00:12:09,634 --> 00:12:11,758
RTGs are very reliable.

206
00:12:11,759 --> 00:12:14,992
They don't generate
a very large amount of power,

207
00:12:15,392 --> 00:12:16,765
but they are very reliable,

208
00:12:16,766 --> 00:12:19,320
and obviously, they last a very long time.

209
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:23,976
On the right-hand side, you have a view
of the top of the Curiosity spacecraft

210
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,416
on the surface of Mars.

211
00:12:25,417 --> 00:12:30,168
And you see here, the RTG,
with the wings that I showed before

212
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:32,453
in the case of the Viking spacecraft.
