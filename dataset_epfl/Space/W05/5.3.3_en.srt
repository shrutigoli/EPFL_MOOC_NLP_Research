1
00:00:07,317 --> 00:00:08,892
Today in this video, we'll talk about

2
00:00:08,892 --> 00:00:11,522
another application of space tethers,

3
00:00:11,522 --> 00:00:14,729
and it's a pure dynamic application,

4
00:00:14,729 --> 00:00:17,479
not electrodynamic, but purely dynamic,

5
00:00:17,479 --> 00:00:19,956
either with a non-conducting tether,

6
00:00:19,956 --> 00:00:26,011
or with a conducting tether
that doesn't carry any current.

7
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:28,365
In this case you don't have
any Lawrence force,

8
00:00:28,365 --> 00:00:31,008
and it's a pure dynamic application.

9
00:00:31,627 --> 00:00:34,981
But first of all, I would like
to come back to the subject

10
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:39,269
of gravity gradients,
because we talked about that before;

11
00:00:39,269 --> 00:00:42,398
we said that's a reason
why an elongated object

12
00:00:42,398 --> 00:00:46,303
on orbit around the Earth
is going to be keeping an orientation

13
00:00:46,303 --> 00:00:51,157
such that the long axis of that object
will be along the local vertical,

14
00:00:51,596 --> 00:00:54,616
and we said it's because
there's more gravity force

15
00:00:54,616 --> 00:00:56,447
on the bottom of the object
than on the top,

16
00:00:56,447 --> 00:00:59,603
so it will align that object
along the local vertical.

17
00:00:59,603 --> 00:01:02,097
And that was obviously correct,
but there's a little more to it

18
00:01:02,097 --> 00:01:04,069
than the gravity gradient.

19
00:01:04,742 --> 00:01:07,669
This is a drawing and some explanation

20
00:01:07,669 --> 00:01:11,216
that are taken out of a reference
that I will mention

21
00:01:11,216 --> 00:01:12,522
at the end of this video.

22
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:15,755
It's called <i>Tethers in Space Handbook,</i>
and I recommend,

23
00:01:15,755 --> 00:01:18,157
if you want to learn more about tethers,

24
00:01:18,157 --> 00:01:20,212
to have a look at this reference.

25
00:01:20,212 --> 00:01:24,361
Now let's look on the left-hand side.

26
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:30,677
We have this large cylinder
along the local vertical,

27
00:01:30,677 --> 00:01:35,013
or tube, inside which
we have an astronaut.

28
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:38,549
And as it's going
around the Earth on orbit,

29
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,608
it's keeping always the orientation
along the local vertical,

30
00:01:42,608 --> 00:01:45,553
as we already talked about.

31
00:01:45,553 --> 00:01:49,754
Now let's imagine an element of mass,

32
00:01:49,754 --> 00:01:52,463
which I will call <i>M</i>,

33
00:01:54,597 --> 00:01:56,925
somewhere inside this cylinder.

34
00:01:56,925 --> 00:02:01,121
This element of mass
will be subject to two forces.

35
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,068
There is, on one hand, the gravity force,

36
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:05,880
which is expressed here,

37
00:02:06,587 --> 00:02:08,636
and it's a force downwards,

38
00:02:09,066 --> 00:02:12,106
which is the product
of the element of mass,

39
00:02:12,106 --> 00:02:18,039
or the mass of this element,
which is <i>M μ / r ²</i>,

40
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:20,567
<i>r</i> being the distance
to the center of the Earth.

41
00:02:20,778 --> 00:02:22,398
That's one force.

42
00:02:22,398 --> 00:02:26,909
And this is a profile
of this force downwards

43
00:02:26,909 --> 00:02:32,282
as we go along the cylinder,
along the local vertical.

44
00:02:33,224 --> 00:02:36,203
Now there is another force
on each element of mass.

45
00:02:36,203 --> 00:02:39,001
This is the so-called <i>centrifugal force,</i>

46
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:41,022
and it's a force upwards,

47
00:02:41,022 --> 00:02:46,430
and it's a product of the mass
of this element times <i>n² r</i>,

48
00:02:46,430 --> 00:02:49,750
<i>n</i> is what we call
the <i>mean motion</i>

49
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:53,790
in <i>rad/s</i>.

50
00:02:53,790 --> 00:02:59,920
So what is important in this
is that the centrifugal force is linear

51
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,205
with respect to the descent
to the center of the Earth,

52
00:03:02,205 --> 00:03:04,229
is proportional to <i>r</i>,

53
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:07,508
as opposed to the gravitational force

54
00:03:07,508 --> 00:03:11,897
which is proportional to <i>1 / r ²</i>.

55
00:03:13,744 --> 00:03:17,676
Now what is interesting is
that these two profiles

56
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:25,130
give null force, <i>F ↑ = F ↓</i>,

57
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,138
the centrifugal force
equals the gravitational force

58
00:03:29,138 --> 00:03:31,275
pretty much at the center
of mass of these tubes,

59
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:32,938
the center of mass or center of gravity.

60
00:03:32,938 --> 00:03:36,508
We'll come back to the difference
between the two in the next slide.

61
00:03:37,152 --> 00:03:41,566
But if we look
in the upper part of the cylinder

62
00:03:41,566 --> 00:03:46,106
we have the centrifugal force
larger than the gravitational force,

63
00:03:46,106 --> 00:03:49,104
so if we have an astronaut
inside that cylinder,

64
00:03:49,104 --> 00:03:53,983
he can have his feet
on the ceiling of this large chamber,

65
00:03:53,983 --> 00:03:56,667
cylindrical chamber,
with a very small force,

66
00:03:56,667 --> 00:03:59,910
but definitely there will be a force
taking him upwards.

67
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:02,024
He can put his feet on the ceiling.

68
00:04:02,024 --> 00:04:05,346
As opposed to the situation at the bottom,

69
00:04:05,346 --> 00:04:09,196
where we have the gravitational force
larger than centrifugal.

70
00:04:09,196 --> 00:04:12,921
In this case the astronaut
can have his or her feet downwards

71
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:14,871
towards the center of the Earth.

72
00:04:14,871 --> 00:04:17,420
Very small force, true,
but a non-zero force.

73
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:23,307
Now this is gravity gradient,
so you see that this force,

74
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:27,717
that, by the way, is causing also
tension on a vertical tether,

75
00:04:27,717 --> 00:04:30,911
is not due only
to the difference in gravity

76
00:04:30,911 --> 00:04:32,816
between the bottom
of the object to the top,

77
00:04:32,816 --> 00:04:34,850
but also to the centrifugal force.

78
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:37,546
There's a contribution of both forces.

79
00:04:37,546 --> 00:04:39,960
And, by the way, gravity gradient forces,

80
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,236
over a distance of about .5 m

81
00:04:43,236 --> 00:04:46,388
is of the order of 10^(-7) gee,

82
00:04:46,388 --> 00:04:51,856
over a distance of about 50 m
of the order of 10^(-5) gee.

83
00:04:51,856 --> 00:04:57,807
When over a pretty large distance,
of 5 km, is about 10^(-3) gee,

84
00:04:57,807 --> 00:05:01,340
so we see that they are very small forces,
but they are non-zero forces.

85
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:04,737
Just a short note on the difference

86
00:05:04,737 --> 00:05:08,556
between center of gravity
and center of mass.

87
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:12,991
Let's take this example here,
if we have a static case,

88
00:05:12,991 --> 00:05:15,992
constant gravity,
a uniform field of gravity,

89
00:05:16,622 --> 00:05:18,791
the center of mass is going to be here,

90
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:23,881
and it can be calculated very easily
with the lever arm principle.

91
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:27,274
And basically the center of mass

92
00:05:27,274 --> 00:05:30,025
is the center of the distribution
of the masses in the object,

93
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:33,954
in the absence of any inertial force
or gravity gradient force.

94
00:05:33,954 --> 00:05:36,361
If we have this case here,
which is, of course,

95
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:40,078
the case which concerns us,
with a tethered satellite,

96
00:05:40,078 --> 00:05:41,792
with the lower body and the upper body,

97
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:46,535
and, on one hand, we have
a non-uniform gravity field--

98
00:05:47,617 --> 00:05:50,681
it's uniform in a room, obviously,
or pretty much uniform in a room,

99
00:05:50,681 --> 00:05:54,408
but over a large distance of 
several tens of kilometers, not uniform.

100
00:05:54,408 --> 00:05:55,707
So we have a gravity gradient.

101
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:58,632
In addition we have the centrifugal force.

102
00:05:59,122 --> 00:06:02,531
In this case, the center of gravity being
the center of the application

103
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:06,323
of the forces on each element
of this elongated object,

104
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:09,738
the center of gravity will not be
exactly in the same location

105
00:06:09,738 --> 00:06:11,888
as the center of mass.
In fact, in our case,

106
00:06:11,888 --> 00:06:14,686
it will be slightly lower
than the center of mass.

107
00:06:15,827 --> 00:06:20,743
Now that's a difference
that we won't have, really, to consider.

108
00:06:20,743 --> 00:06:23,651
We'll consider always in our application
that the center of mass

109
00:06:23,651 --> 00:06:25,807
is the same location
as the center of gravity,

110
00:06:25,807 --> 00:06:27,243
the difference is very small.

111
00:06:27,243 --> 00:06:31,173
I just wanted you to be aware
of the theoretical difference

112
00:06:31,173 --> 00:06:32,977
between these two concepts.

113
00:06:33,767 --> 00:06:35,919
That's another illustration of the same.

114
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:41,843
You have two equal masses
linked with a tether,

115
00:06:41,843 --> 00:06:46,294
or it could be a bar, for that matter,
on orbit around the Earth.

116
00:06:46,294 --> 00:06:48,558
And the mass 1 is equal to mass 2,

117
00:06:48,558 --> 00:06:50,464
and the center of mass
is exactly in the middle,

118
00:06:50,464 --> 00:06:53,527
but the center of gravity
somewhat closer to the lower mass.

119
00:06:53,527 --> 00:06:57,987
You see here the forces <i>F_1</i> and <i>F_2</i>
on the two end masses,

120
00:06:57,987 --> 00:07:00,427
and it's the difference 
between these two forces

121
00:07:00,427 --> 00:07:04,397
that will cause also a moment
or a talk of these objects

122
00:07:04,397 --> 00:07:07,590
so it will take an orientation
along the local vertical.

123
00:07:07,968 --> 00:07:10,642
And again, in the rest of this section,
including the quizzes,

124
00:07:10,642 --> 00:07:12,620
we'll consider the center
of mass and of gravity

125
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:14,213
are in the same location.

126
00:07:15,485 --> 00:07:19,389
Here we have an important illustration
that shows the various velocities,

127
00:07:19,389 --> 00:07:21,845
and especially it will tell us
what will happen

128
00:07:21,845 --> 00:07:23,500
in case the tether breaks.

129
00:07:24,854 --> 00:07:28,059
We have the lower body,
which is the Shuttle.

130
00:07:28,059 --> 00:07:31,473
We have here the center of gravity,
or the center of mass, whatever,

131
00:07:31,473 --> 00:07:34,581
and the top body is a satellite,

132
00:07:34,581 --> 00:07:36,608
and this is the tether in between.

133
00:07:36,608 --> 00:07:39,726
And this is exactly the condition
that we talked about before,

134
00:07:39,726 --> 00:07:43,415
and we'll come back to that,
that was illustrated in these tests

135
00:07:43,415 --> 00:07:46,254
of the tethered satellite,
using the Space Shuttle as a base.

136
00:07:46,997 --> 00:07:51,958
Now we have indicated here a line

137
00:07:52,948 --> 00:07:56,935
which is a line of the velocities
of these objects.

138
00:07:56,935 --> 00:08:01,549
All of the objects along this tether
are kind of locked in velocity,

139
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:06,090
and they are forced
to maintain a certain velocity

140
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:08,947
because of the vertical character
of the tether.

141
00:08:08,947 --> 00:08:14,346
Let's look first at the velocity

142
00:08:14,346 --> 00:08:18,593
of the center of gravity, here, <i>v_CG</i>.

143
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:27,077
The amplitude is equal
to <i>v_CG circular on a free orbit</i>.

144
00:08:28,043 --> 00:08:29,742
If you imagine that you started deployment

145
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:33,385
of the tethered satellite
from the orbiter

146
00:08:33,385 --> 00:08:36,694
initially, of course, the two objects
are at the same location,

147
00:08:36,694 --> 00:08:38,092
and they have a certain velocity,

148
00:08:38,092 --> 00:08:41,056
which is a circular velocity
at that altitude

149
00:08:41,056 --> 00:08:43,196
as you deploy the tether upwards,

150
00:08:44,029 --> 00:08:47,665
the Space Shuttle comes
slightly downward versus the <i>CG</i>,

151
00:08:47,665 --> 00:08:50,695
but the <i>CG</i> will maintain the same velocity

152
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:53,862
as it had before
the beginning of the deployment.

153
00:08:53,862 --> 00:08:55,523
The Space Shuttle will go down somewhat,

154
00:08:55,523 --> 00:08:57,462
and of course the satellite will go up.

155
00:08:57,951 --> 00:09:01,257
Now we have,
after the deployment is complete,

156
00:09:01,257 --> 00:09:05,251
typically of the order of 20 km,
we have the distance of the satellite

157
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:08,015
to the center of the Earth is <i>r_sat </i>,

158
00:09:08,015 --> 00:09:12,054
and this distance of the Shuttle
to the center of the Earth is <i>r_Shuttle</i>.

159
00:09:12,754 --> 00:09:16,503
And, of course, <i>r_Shuttle</i>
is slower than <i>r_CG</i>,

160
00:09:16,503 --> 00:09:19,226
and <i>r_sat</i> is larger than <i>r_CG</i>.

161
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:22,206
Let's look at velocities now
of the upper body.

162
00:09:22,206 --> 00:09:27,143
We have, in blue, <i>v_sat</i>

163
00:09:30,384 --> 00:09:36,843
is larger than <i>v_circ sat</i>.

164
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,394
And we have here <i>v_Shuttle</i>,

165
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:47,973
also in blue,

166
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:52,512
is less than <i>v_circ Shuttle</i>.

167
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:59,325
When I say <i>v_circ</i>, the velocities
that are along this red line here,

168
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:00,736
and as we know,

169
00:10:00,736 --> 00:10:06,756
the <i>v_circ</i> is proportional 
to <i>1 over square root r </i>.

170
00:10:08,236 --> 00:10:10,914
Circular velocity, as we know very well,

171
00:10:10,914 --> 00:10:15,025
<i>v_circ</i> is equal
to the square root of <i>μ / r</i>.

172
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:17,796
So <i>v_circ</i>, or at least the absolute value,

173
00:10:17,796 --> 00:10:20,924
is proportional to <i>1 over square root r </i>.

174
00:10:21,861 --> 00:10:26,332
That's the reason why we have
this situation here.

175
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,462
The red line, as you see,
is much shorter respectively,

176
00:10:30,462 --> 00:10:32,784
than the red vector,
which is <i>v_circ sat</i>,

177
00:10:32,784 --> 00:10:35,498
is much less that <i>v_sat</i>.

178
00:10:35,975 --> 00:10:40,059
The satellite is forced,
because of the tether geometry,

179
00:10:40,059 --> 00:10:44,893
to go to a velocity which is
quite a bit larger than the <i>v_circ sat</i>.

180
00:10:44,893 --> 00:10:47,252
And, in the case of the Shuttle,

181
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:52,049
the Space Shuttle here is forced,
that's the blue arrow,

182
00:10:52,049 --> 00:10:56,534
the <i>v_Shuttle</i>, to go slower,
the <i>v_circ Shuttle</i>,

183
00:10:56,534 --> 00:10:58,500
the red arrow, here.

184
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:03,213
So you have to consider now
what will happen if we cut the tether.

185
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:10,290
If we cut the tether suddenly,
the satellite will find itself moving

186
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,792
at quite a bit higher velocity, <i>v_sat</i>
than the <i>v_circ sat</i>,

187
00:11:15,792 --> 00:11:21,429
so it is as if suddenly you're giving
to the satellite a <i>Δv_sat</i> posigrade,

188
00:11:21,429 --> 00:11:23,974
that will, of course,
inject it to a higher altitude.

189
00:11:23,974 --> 00:11:26,003
On the contrary, with the Shuttle,

190
00:11:26,003 --> 00:11:31,233
the Shuttle is forced to go
with <i>v_Shuttle</i>, the blue value,

191
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:34,879
which is smaller than the <i>v_circ Shuttle</i>,

192
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:37,559
so if you cut the tether,
suddenly you're going to have

193
00:11:37,559 --> 00:11:39,976
this little green arrow here, retrograde,

194
00:11:39,976 --> 00:11:41,642
<i>Δv_Shuttle</i> is going to be a negative,

195
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:44,474
but a smaller value
than we had for the satellite,

196
00:11:44,474 --> 00:11:46,703
and the Shuttle will be forced,
suddenly, to come down.

197
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:51,329
It's as if you were giving it suddenly
a <i>Δv_Shuttle</i> retrograde,

198
00:11:51,329 --> 00:11:52,832
it will come down.

199
00:11:54,596 --> 00:11:56,966
Let's consider again the tether cut.

200
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,451
By the way, that's what happened
on one of the tether missions,

201
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:03,008
STS-75 in 1996.

202
00:12:03,236 --> 00:12:08,022
We deployed, plan was 20 km--
at 19.6 km the tether broke,

203
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:10,647
so this is really something that happened.

204
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:13,299
Now, we have simplified this illustration.

205
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:15,543
At the center, here,
we started deployment,

206
00:12:15,543 --> 00:12:19,168
and we go clockwise on this orbit.

207
00:12:19,168 --> 00:12:20,980
And here we have completed the deployment.

208
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:24,828
Of course the deployment,
in reality, took many, many orbits.

209
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,701
But let's suppose we are here,

210
00:12:26,701 --> 00:12:29,919
at full deployment,
or close to full deployment, 20 km,

211
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:31,440
and we cut the tether.

212
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,597
As I said before, in the previous slide,

213
00:12:34,597 --> 00:12:38,950
it's as if you were giving
the satellite a posigrade <i>Δv</i>,

214
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,904
which will, of course,
take it to a higher orbit.

215
00:12:40,904 --> 00:12:46,196
This is like the first "burn,"
quote unquote,

216
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:49,687
of a Hohmann transfer,
but if we go to a higher orbit

217
00:12:49,687 --> 00:12:52,537
with the apogee on the other side, here,

218
00:12:52,537 --> 00:12:55,720
which will be quite a bit higher
than the initial circular orbit,

219
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:58,449
And the Space Shuttle, on the contrary,

220
00:12:58,449 --> 00:13:02,851
will have a relatively small,
but non-zero, retrograde <i>Δv</i>

221
00:13:02,851 --> 00:13:05,139
that will take it to a lower orbit.

222
00:13:05,539 --> 00:13:08,203
And you can immediately
imagine the applications.

223
00:13:08,203 --> 00:13:10,122
If you deploy something
with the Space Shuttle,

224
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:12,898
you want to take it to a higher orbit
without using propellant,

225
00:13:12,898 --> 00:13:15,071
you deploy it on a tether,
and then you cut the tether,

226
00:13:15,071 --> 00:13:17,589
and the satellite goes
to a higher orbit which is what you want,

227
00:13:17,589 --> 00:13:19,791
without using propellant,

228
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,470
and the Space Shuttle has performed

229
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,855
at least part of the deorbit impulse,
reduction of velocity,

230
00:13:25,855 --> 00:13:28,442
because eventually we want it
to come and land with the Shuttle,

231
00:13:28,442 --> 00:13:32,685
we want to reduce its orbital latitude
or orbital energy.

232
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:38,080
So this shows the really interesting,
fantastic application of tether,

233
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,686
from a pure dynamic point of view.

234
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:41,865
Here we talk about
a non-conductive tether,

235
00:13:41,865 --> 00:13:45,007
it's just a physical link
between the lower body and the upper body.

236
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:49,180
The space elevator is a concept
that was imagined by Arthur Clarke,

237
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:53,739
the very brilliant
British engineer-scientist.

238
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:58,559
He invented many other concepts
in space exploration,

239
00:13:58,559 --> 00:14:01,055
but the space elevator is one of them.

240
00:14:01,055 --> 00:14:04,913
Imagine that you are deploying a tether
from the surface of the Earth,

241
00:14:04,913 --> 00:14:07,720
on the Equator, upwards,

242
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:13,049
a tether that is longer than the distance

243
00:14:13,049 --> 00:14:14,449
to the geostationary orbit,

244
00:14:14,449 --> 00:14:16,578
which, as we know,
from the surface of the Earth

245
00:14:16,578 --> 00:14:20,210
is about 36,000 km,
and you put a counterweight

246
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:25,789
at the end of this long tether,
of say 40,000 or 45,000 km.

247
00:14:26,026 --> 00:14:29,016
Of course technically it's not easy to do,
but imagine that.

248
00:14:29,016 --> 00:14:31,325
You have a counterweight
attached to the center of mass

249
00:14:31,325 --> 00:14:34,522
of the whole system
is above the geostationary orbit.

250
00:14:34,522 --> 00:14:36,854
In this case, you are going
to have tension on the tether,

251
00:14:36,854 --> 00:14:39,787
constant tension,
because of the centrifugal force,

252
00:14:39,787 --> 00:14:42,910
which is fighting against the gravity,
but here it's winning,

253
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,669
because of this geometrical concept,
with a counterweight.

254
00:14:46,669 --> 00:14:48,778
And then you can have a climber,

255
00:14:48,778 --> 00:14:50,744
equipped with, for instance, solar arrays,

256
00:14:50,744 --> 00:14:57,075
so it generates electrical power
from the Sun during the day,

257
00:14:57,075 --> 00:15:00,984
and it has electric motors,
and it can climb along that tether,

258
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:05,927
so you could have access to any orbits
between low Earth orbits

259
00:15:05,927 --> 00:15:08,424
and the geostationary orbit,
without using any propellant,

260
00:15:08,424 --> 00:15:12,312
but just using solar power,
by climbing with this elevator.

261
00:15:12,827 --> 00:15:14,783
That's the concept of the space elevator.

262
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:16,970
Of course, technically speaking,
it's really difficult.

263
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:20,551
If you imagine that you hire
a company to do that,

264
00:15:20,551 --> 00:15:22,398
that's going to be a difficult contract,

265
00:15:22,398 --> 00:15:24,528
and it's going to be hard
for a company to promise

266
00:15:24,528 --> 00:15:26,595
that they are going to be able to do that.

267
00:15:26,595 --> 00:15:29,617
It still is an idea that is very present
in the minds of many people,

268
00:15:29,617 --> 00:15:31,159
and someday it may happen.

269
00:15:31,159 --> 00:15:35,514
Access, cheap access to space,
all the way to the geostationary orbit,

270
00:15:35,514 --> 00:15:37,364
or even possibly beyond.

271
00:15:38,134 --> 00:15:40,755
As you have seen, tethers in space
is a fascinating subject,

272
00:15:40,755 --> 00:15:42,100
and very promising.

273
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:44,150
If you want to know more
about what has been done,

274
00:15:44,150 --> 00:15:48,257
by a number of mainly Italian scientists,
Cosmo, Lorenzini,

275
00:15:48,257 --> 00:15:51,915
and some Americans, also,
this is a very good reference.

276
00:15:51,915 --> 00:15:57,222
You'll find it on the internet,
and it has a lot of pages--

277
00:15:57,222 --> 00:16:01,712
On one hand the principles,
dynamic and electrodynamic principles,

278
00:16:01,712 --> 00:16:05,751
are explained in detail, much more
than I've been able to do here.

279
00:16:05,751 --> 00:16:09,149
And also there are a lot of applications,
potential applications,

280
00:16:09,149 --> 00:16:12,138
potential application of tethers in space.

281
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:16,414
So have a look,
and you can bring your own ideas

282
00:16:16,414 --> 00:16:18,918
about applying this fantastic system.
