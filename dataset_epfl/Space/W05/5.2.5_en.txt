Let's look at methods for gyro-based attitude control systems.
First, the reaction wheel used on Hubble.
And later, we'll look at CMGs, or control moment gyros, used on the International Space Station, the US segment.
A reaction wheel or momentum wheel.
The situation is the following: we have here the vehicle and we have a spinning wheel attached to it.
This is the wheel spinning with a fixed value of <i>Ï‰</i>, the angular velocity:
<i>Ï‰</i> wheel.
And it's rotating in this direction.
Its certain value, a pretty high value of the rotation speed either in revolutions per minute or in radians per second.
You need to be careful with the unit that is being used and transform accordingly.
Now, if we increase the angular velocity of the spinning wheel, there will be a reaction of the vehicle in the other direction, because of the conservation of angular momentum.
So, let's take the initial value of the angular speed of the wheel, and then, at some point, we increase this value, and then, we decrease it from time <i>t_0</i>.
And we put here <i>t_0</i> until the time <i>t_m</i>.
And, this is the <i>Ï‰</i> of the wheel.
So, increasing to a certain value, this is the <i>Ï‰</i> wheel max equal the angular acceleration
<i>Î±</i> wheel times <i>t_m</i> over two.
Let's say <i>t_0</i> equals zero here, it's easier this way.
We have the conservation of angular momentum, so the total angular momentum of the complex vehicle plus reaction wheel is the following: we have...
<i>I_v</i> times <i>Ï‰_v</i> plus
<i>I</i> wheel times <i>Ï‰</i> wheel equal constant.
And the <i>I_v</i> is a moment of inertia of the vehicle.
<i>I_w</i>, moment of inertia of the wheel.
So if you take the time derivative, it's...
<iI_v</i>
<i>Î±_v</i> plus
<i>I_w</i>,
<i>Î±_w</i> equal zero.
So it means the angular acceleration of the vehicle in reaction to the increase in the angular velocity of the wheel, and then of the decrease.
The <i>Î±</i> vehicle is always going to be minus the ratio of the moments of inertia times <i>Î±</i> wheel.
There's no more room, so let's go to the next one here.
I'll have to redraw the profile of <i>Ï‰</i> for the wheel.
<i>t_m</i>, time maneuver, let's take a zero here.
And this is <i>Ï‰</i> wheel to a value maximum of <i>Î±</i> wheel <i>t_m</i> over two, and then, I represent here in the bottom, the reaction of the vehicle to the increased value of <i>Ï‰</i> wheel, and then the decrease.
Now, let's have here
<i>Ï‰</i> vehicle.
That's the middle point here.
This is <i>t_m</i>.
There will be of course a decrease, and then an increase: the negative sign.
What is important is that the value that we have here for <i>Ï‰</i> vehicle at the maximum value of the <i>Ï‰</i> wheel is gonna be equal to... minus one half the ratio of the moment of inertias wheel and the vehicle
<i>Î±</i> wheel
<i>t_m</i>.
And now, the angular change of the vehicle, let's say the <i>Î”Î¸</i>, 
I can write here for the vehicle, is gonna be equal to this surface here, is that the integral of the value of <i>Ï‰</i> vehicle over time from zero until <i>t_m</i>.
Let's see how to derive that.
That's gonna be... that surface is gonna be equal to... let's put a positive sign, because that's just a value of the change in angle.
It's gonna be one quarter, that's the one half that we have here.
But the total triangle has half the surface of this big rectangle that we have here.
One quarter times, the ratio of the moments of inertia
<i>Î±</i> wheel,
<i>t_m</i> square.
These are <i>t_m</i> that we have here, plus, of course, the <i>t_m</i>, the total length of the base of the triangle.
So this is the value that we have for a change of angle of the vehicle in reaction to this increase and then decrease of the rotation speed of the reaction wheel.
Let's look at the single gimbal
Control Moment Gyroscope or CMG.
Now, the principle is a little bit different.
Let's go back to the second law of Newton for rotations.
We have torque equal <i>dL</i>, angular momentum over <i>dt</i>, and we have
<i>L </i>...
We have a spinning wheel here with a value of <i>Ï‰</i>.
A rotation in this direction.
So this is wheel on a gimbal, on the one-axis gimbal here.
So let's put here, the <i>L</i> for the wheel is equal to moment of inertia of the wheel times its angular speed
<i>Ï‰</i> wheel.
Now what is important is that if we have a torque on this system here...
So it's going to be a rotation in this direction using the right-hand rule.
What is important is that the time derivative of the angular momentum of the wheel is in the same direction as a torque.
So this is of course equal to
<i>Éª_w</i>, <i>dÏ‰</i> wheel
<i>dt</i>.
This is <i>Ï‰</i> wheel.
The torque being in this direction,
<i>dÏ‰</i>... wheel over <i>dt</i> will be in the same direction.
So you see that this will change the orientation of the spinning wheel, which is represented here in this vector upwards in this direction.
So we apply torque here, which is basically an attempt to rotate the base of the gyroscope, the single gimbal-based gyroscope in this orientation, and the reaction will be a rotation in this direction of the spinning wheel.
It's important to realize that the spin angular momentum is always in the direction of the torque.
The torque is over there, and the change in the <i>Ï‰</i> wheel is in the same direction, causing the rotation that we talked about.
Now, the same principle is used for the ISS attitude control system on the US segment.
If you have the ISS in general with the cluster of module, then we have the sidebar with the solar rays at the end.
We know this is a <i>X</i>, and this is going to be <i>Y</i> and <i>Z</i>.
The Russian segment is in the aft of the International Space Station; the US segment is in the forward portion, and this is the Russian segment.
It has attitude control with thrusters, and this is a US segment.
It's using CMGs, which are represented in the lower left.
You see the four CMGs; there's some redundancy there.
You have four; three would be needed, but there are four.
The ISS CMG reorientation of the wheels causes torque on the ISS and attitude control.
It's good to have a double system with the thrusters in the back and the CMGs in the front, because using CMGs doesn't use any propellant, it uses electrical power generated by the solar rays, but sometimes you have saturation of the gyros, and in order to unsaturate them, you have to use the Russian segment, thruster bay's attitude control system, then you can unsaturate them, so it's quite a nice system to have both components:
CMG and thruster bay's attitude control system on ISS.
