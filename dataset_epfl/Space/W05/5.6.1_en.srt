1
00:00:08,751 --> 00:00:11,502
My name is Hitoshi Kuninaka.

2
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,792
I received a PhD
from the University of Tokyo in 1988,

3
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:21,971
and I was promoted
to Associate Professor and Full Professor

4
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:25,792
in JAXA Aerospace Exploration Agency

5
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:30,300
in Japan, in 2000 and 2005 respectively.

6
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:36,209
Now, I'm the Director of Space Exploration
Innovation Hub Center of JAXA.

7
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:42,099
In the... my academic experience,

8
00:00:42,424 --> 00:00:46,041
I research plasma interaction
of satellites,

9
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:49,339
and develop electric propulsion.

10
00:00:49,993 --> 00:00:54,657
I have several chances
to participate in the satellite project.

11
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:59,167
One of them is the... we call it:
Space Flyer Unit (SFU)

12
00:00:59,956 --> 00:01:02,641
from 1988 to 1996.

13
00:01:03,449 --> 00:01:08,374
This satellite, SFU,
was launched by H-II rocket

14
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:12,917
from Tanegashima Space Center,
Japan in 1995,

15
00:01:13,428 --> 00:01:19,514
and one year later, it came back
to Cape Canaveral, US, in 1996

16
00:01:20,083 --> 00:01:24,834
by Space Shuttle STS-72 successfully.

17
00:01:27,354 --> 00:01:33,354
I have researched and invented
the microwave discharge ion engine,

18
00:01:34,334 --> 00:01:38,872
which made Hayabusa Explorer
round-trip space mission

19
00:01:38,873 --> 00:01:43,816
between Earth and an asteroid
from 2003 to 2010.

20
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:50,351
And then, after that,
we started another space mission

21
00:01:50,701 --> 00:01:52,924
that we call Hayabusa 2.

22
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:57,578
I took charge of the development
of Hayabusa 2 Asteroid Explorer

23
00:01:57,838 --> 00:01:59,215
as a project manager.

24
00:02:00,025 --> 00:02:01,047
That's all.

25
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:11,891
So, Hayabusa Asteroid Explorer
was a technological demonstration mission,

26
00:02:12,751 --> 00:02:16,690
so new engineering challenges
in those days were:

27
00:02:17,118 --> 00:02:21,974
first one is the autonomous operation
at the far-away space from us.

28
00:02:22,494 --> 00:02:25,607
Second one is
the deep space communication.

29
00:02:26,413 --> 00:02:30,213
Third one is the navigation technology
for the long journey

30
00:02:30,214 --> 00:02:32,117
between Earth and the asteroid.

31
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:36,078
Number four: high efficient
space propulsion system.

32
00:02:36,598 --> 00:02:40,299
Number five: landing
on the surface of the asteroid.

33
00:02:40,624 --> 00:02:43,151
Number six: sample collecting method;

34
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:46,604
and number seven is
the reentry capsule technology

35
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:49,093
from space to Earth and so on.

36
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:52,897
The total weight is about 500 kg.

37
00:02:54,254 --> 00:02:57,909
That is maybe small...
equivalent to a small car,

38
00:02:59,089 --> 00:03:02,205
it was the smallest spacecraft
in deep space.

39
00:03:03,294 --> 00:03:05,167
It was... I have already said

40
00:03:05,168 --> 00:03:08,730
that Hayabusa is
the technology demonstration mission,

41
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:15,293
so that Hayabusa was not really particular
about a target asteroid.

42
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:18,974
Selection criteria of the asteroid is

43
00:03:20,024 --> 00:03:21,107
to ensure

44
00:03:23,015 --> 00:03:26,911
the outward and inward journey
from the Earth and the asteroid.

45
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:32,793
Then, so that we select
the asteroid Itokawa,

46
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:34,672
which is an S-type asteroid,

47
00:03:34,673 --> 00:03:37,293
that is a very ordinary asteroid

48
00:03:38,353 --> 00:03:42,255
in the group of the near-Earth asteroid.

49
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,530
That is a very average
and ordinary S-type asteroid.

50
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:53,016
That is a brief introduction, explanation
of the Hayabusa mission.

51
00:04:01,839 --> 00:04:03,317
Hayabusa was launched

52
00:04:04,187 --> 00:04:06,178
May 9th 2003,

53
00:04:06,976 --> 00:04:10,826
and after that, the return
on ion engine in space,

54
00:04:11,166 --> 00:04:12,445
and we executed

55
00:04:13,325 --> 00:04:17,285
the pod cruise in deep space.

56
00:04:17,704 --> 00:04:19,005
One year later,

57
00:04:19,596 --> 00:04:22,145
May 19th 2004,

58
00:04:22,542 --> 00:04:25,751
the spacecraft executed the Earth swingby.

59
00:04:26,096 --> 00:04:28,374
Using the Earth's gravity field,

60
00:04:29,074 --> 00:04:32,268
the spacecraft accelerated much more,

61
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,428
and then so, spacecraft Hayabusa

62
00:04:36,828 --> 00:04:38,659
traveled to target asteroid,

63
00:04:38,667 --> 00:04:44,667
and then so, it succeeded to rendezvous
with the asteroid

64
00:04:44,676 --> 00:04:46,846
September 12th 2005.

65
00:04:48,086 --> 00:04:52,047
And then, so first of all,
we observed the target asteroid

66
00:04:52,687 --> 00:04:55,205
in the way of the remote sensing,

67
00:04:55,645 --> 00:04:59,128
and then, we decided to touching point,

68
00:04:59,518 --> 00:05:02,794
and then so we executed
the first touchdown operation

69
00:05:03,013 --> 00:05:05,136
November 20th 2005.

70
00:05:05,866 --> 00:05:10,172
And then so after that, one week later,
November 26th,

71
00:05:10,582 --> 00:05:12,752
we executed the second touchdown,

72
00:05:13,232 --> 00:05:16,618
but in space operations,
we had a lot of trouble,

73
00:05:17,098 --> 00:05:19,860
and then so we lost communication

74
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:24,921
with the spacecraft on December 8th 2005.

75
00:05:25,805 --> 00:05:31,140
But fortunately, we resumed
communication one month...

76
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,840
one point five months later

77
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,917
January 23rd 2006.

78
00:05:37,792 --> 00:05:43,024
And then, so we resumed
the operation of the Hayabusa,

79
00:05:43,538 --> 00:05:48,720
and then we successfully turned
on the ion engine again,

80
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:53,729
and then we started the return journey
from the asteroid to Earth.

81
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:55,720
And then, so finally,

82
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:58,994
June 13th 2010,

83
00:05:59,414 --> 00:06:02,344
we succeeded in the retrieval operation

84
00:06:02,794 --> 00:06:03,854
of Hayabusa.

85
00:06:05,154 --> 00:06:08,848
That is the chronology of the operation
of the Hayabusa mission.

86
00:06:14,424 --> 00:06:19,475
So I believe... I think we established
the new observation scheme:

87
00:06:20,035 --> 00:06:22,475
that is the asteroid sample return.

88
00:06:23,434 --> 00:06:26,864
So in the conventional way
of space mission,

89
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:31,978
first of all, we decided
to deduct matter and a method

90
00:06:32,298 --> 00:06:34,271
on the basis of the hypothesis,

91
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:38,652
and then we developed
a lightweight, small volume,

92
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:43,932
low power, very expensive,
on board scientific instrument,

93
00:06:44,992 --> 00:06:47,691
which will be installed
on board the spacecraft

94
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:52,774
and convoyed to the target asteroid,
and then we get the data.

95
00:06:53,733 --> 00:06:58,304
So that is the conventional scheme
for space science,

96
00:06:58,305 --> 00:07:03,141
but on the other hand,
asteroid sample return observation

97
00:07:03,142 --> 00:07:04,632
is completely different.

98
00:07:05,315 --> 00:07:10,254
We collect the sample from the asteroid,
and bring it back to Earth.

99
00:07:10,601 --> 00:07:13,976
And then, the collected sample
will be brought

100
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:17,761
into the ground based,
huge, high accurate,

101
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:21,103
various kinds of analytical machines,

102
00:07:21,533 --> 00:07:26,082
just like X-Rays, tomography,
or electron microscopes, and so on,

103
00:07:26,838 --> 00:07:30,741
so that the analytical method
is completely different.

104
00:07:31,514 --> 00:07:36,949
And I would like to say that this method
has a very good advantage.

105
00:07:37,416 --> 00:07:40,736
So if we consider the ten years later,

106
00:07:41,126 --> 00:07:44,529
these analytical machines
will be improved much more,

107
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:48,498
so that the collected sample
will be devoted,

108
00:07:48,788 --> 00:07:52,664
and again such improved machines

109
00:07:53,324 --> 00:07:56,254
in the sense that we can get other data,

110
00:07:57,224 --> 00:08:01,900
these are the advantages
of the asteroid sample return method,

111
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:03,265
I believe.

112
00:08:09,055 --> 00:08:10,222
I'm working in the field

113
00:08:10,223 --> 00:08:12,783
of Earth-space science
and space technology.

114
00:08:13,143 --> 00:08:18,312
But these fields are
very very narrow topics in general.

115
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:25,367
But the Hayabusa return expanded
the knowledge and experience

116
00:08:25,368 --> 00:08:29,916
of not only space scientists,
but also of the general public.

117
00:08:30,686 --> 00:08:34,001
A lot of people in Japan
as well internationally

118
00:08:34,511 --> 00:08:38,657
were glad, very glad
of the return of Hayabusa.

119
00:08:39,451 --> 00:08:41,770
One of the phenomena of our evidence,

120
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:45,432
full movies about the Hayabusa story

121
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:47,450
including one with Twentieth Century Fox

122
00:08:47,451 --> 00:08:48,445
were made.

123
00:08:48,702 --> 00:08:51,510
So we were very surprised
with this phenomena.

124
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:55,213
But it was a very good experience.

125
00:09:01,133 --> 00:09:04,475
Ah yes, so my academic field is

126
00:09:05,586 --> 00:09:10,248
around the research and development
of electrical propulsion.

127
00:09:11,855 --> 00:09:17,368
In this work, I invented
a new ion engine system

128
00:09:17,369 --> 00:09:19,016
dedicated for Hayabusa.

129
00:09:19,312 --> 00:09:22,630
I took charge of the development
and operations

130
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:24,873
of the ion engine on board Hayabusa.

131
00:09:28,251 --> 00:09:29,809
I had another task

132
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:33,837
at the capsule return operation
at the final phase.

133
00:09:34,450 --> 00:09:38,126
I was the team leader
of the delegation to Australia

134
00:09:38,636 --> 00:09:40,834
for the recovery operation of the capsule.

135
00:09:49,276 --> 00:09:51,875
Yes, so conventional ion engines

136
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:56,514
generate plasma
using the direct current discharge.

137
00:09:57,324 --> 00:10:02,106
But in this scheme,
so lifetime and endurance are limited

138
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,766
associated with the discharge electrodes,

139
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:09,001
so this device, discharge electrode,

140
00:10:10,801 --> 00:10:13,396
has some troubles,

141
00:10:17,172 --> 00:10:21,474
but our system, the microwave discharge
ion engine generates plasma

142
00:10:21,475 --> 00:10:26,093
by means of the microwave power
without discharging electrodes.

143
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:29,436
I eliminated all the discharge electrodes

144
00:10:29,437 --> 00:10:33,883
and prolong the life of the system,
ensuring the system's reliability,

145
00:10:34,613 --> 00:10:40,807
so that the microwave ion discharge engine
is a different system... a new system.

146
00:10:42,323 --> 00:10:44,381
That is one of the challenges.

147
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:56,596
Yes, I have already explained to you
that the follow-on mission from Hayabusa,

148
00:10:56,846 --> 00:10:58,342
that is the Hayabusa 2.

149
00:10:58,767 --> 00:11:02,696
From 2011, we started
to develop Hayabusa 2

150
00:11:02,937 --> 00:11:05,543
as the next asteroid
sample return mission.

151
00:11:07,268 --> 00:11:09,246
So the new spacecraft Hayabusa 2

152
00:11:09,247 --> 00:11:14,047
also takes the ion engine system
as the main propulsion.

153
00:11:16,587 --> 00:11:21,957
Hayabusa 2 was successfully launched
December 2014,

154
00:11:22,254 --> 00:11:29,161
and now it executes a space voyage
to asteroid Ryugu, a new asteroid.

155
00:11:30,545 --> 00:11:33,471
Same technology of the ion engine system

156
00:11:33,851 --> 00:11:35,635
was applied to Hayabusa 2.

157
00:11:43,175 --> 00:11:46,332
So space technology
and electric propulsion,

158
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,839
they are very challenging fields,

159
00:11:51,119 --> 00:11:55,660
so that here I want to challenge
to the new field,

160
00:11:56,373 --> 00:12:00,276
I think my spirit of challenge
makes me so.
