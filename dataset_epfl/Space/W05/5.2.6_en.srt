1
00:00:05,639 --> 00:00:10,523
Let's talk now about the attitude control
and translation control

2
00:00:10,523 --> 00:00:14,512
of the Space Shuttle
from the forward flight deck

3
00:00:14,512 --> 00:00:15,802
and the aft flight deck.

4
00:00:15,802 --> 00:00:18,025
Of course this is all history,
but it's quite interesting

5
00:00:18,025 --> 00:00:23,102
the way these controls were implemented
in the forward station

6
00:00:23,102 --> 00:00:26,361
and the aft station,
so I think it's worth having a look at it.

7
00:00:28,061 --> 00:00:32,800
We have first of all the commander's seat
on the lefthand side

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,212
looking forward 
and on the righthand side, pilot's seat.

9
00:00:36,534 --> 00:00:40,385
And we have here the commander's
rotation hand controller,

10
00:00:40,385 --> 00:00:43,769
three degrees of freedom,
or three axes of rotation,

11
00:00:43,769 --> 00:00:45,181
rotation hand controller,

12
00:00:45,181 --> 00:00:47,922
and we have the translation 
hand controller here.

13
00:00:48,031 --> 00:00:51,327
On the pilot's side,
we only have a rotation hand controller.

14
00:00:51,327 --> 00:00:55,029
The translation hand controller
was only available for the commander

15
00:00:55,029 --> 00:00:56,705
on the lefthand side.

16
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:59,624
Now, in order to do 
translations and rotations,

17
00:00:59,624 --> 00:01:02,501
we always need to have 
a reference direction.

18
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:05,751
And the reference direction, in this case,
is the <i>plus X</i> direction,

19
00:01:05,751 --> 00:01:09,744
which is this direction here,
<i>plus X</i> toward the nose.

20
00:01:09,856 --> 00:01:13,366
Just a little detail that I want 
to explain also,

21
00:01:13,366 --> 00:01:15,915
this is the attitude director indicator.

22
00:01:15,915 --> 00:01:19,662
We have the same on the pilot's side.

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:25,247
And, as indicated before,
we can have either the attitude indicated

24
00:01:25,247 --> 00:01:29,736
according to the inertial 
coordinate system,

25
00:01:29,736 --> 00:01:33,068
the geocentric inertial coordinate system,
or the LVLH.

26
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:36,760
And there was a switch about here
that we could change

27
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:41,784
from the position inertial to LVLH.

28
00:01:43,143 --> 00:01:45,913
We had the choice between 
one or the other.

29
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:50,983
And the attitude indicating
the ADI, attitude director indicator,

30
00:01:50,983 --> 00:01:55,294
left or right, but always according to 
what was selected on this switch.

31
00:01:56,462 --> 00:01:59,934
That's it for the forward cockpit.

32
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:04,406
Let's look now at the aft flight deck.

33
00:02:04,859 --> 00:02:08,279
For most of the time 
during the orbit portion,

34
00:02:08,279 --> 00:02:11,873
the commander or the pilot
were commanding in rotation

35
00:02:11,873 --> 00:02:16,214
or translation the Space Shuttle orbiter
from the aft flight deck.

36
00:02:16,214 --> 00:02:21,282
Here you have the rotation
hand controller.

37
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:25,784
Here you have the translation 
hand controller.

38
00:02:26,873 --> 00:02:34,794
And it's interesting to see that both are 
according to 45 degree direction

39
00:02:34,794 --> 00:02:38,854
versus the <i>minus X</i> body axis
of the Space Shuttle.

40
00:02:38,854 --> 00:02:41,716
In fact, <i>minus X</i> is in this direction.

41
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:47,032
And we have <i>minus Z</i>
in this direction here.

42
00:02:49,404 --> 00:02:51,180
This is <i>minus X</i>.

43
00:02:51,592 --> 00:02:57,099
It was possible to select 
control of the rotation and translation

44
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:02,059
of the Space Shuttle either with respect
to a reference direction

45
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:06,626
which is <i>minus X</i> or <i>minus Z</i>--
it was a switch also in this area here.

46
00:03:06,981 --> 00:03:10,330
We could select either <i>minus X</i>
or <i>minus Z</i>.

47
00:03:10,585 --> 00:03:15,192
So you always had to imagine
that you were either controlling

48
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:18,374
versus the <i>minus X</i>
or versus <i>minus Z</i>.

49
00:03:18,374 --> 00:03:21,223
You really needed to know exactly
what was the selection

50
00:03:21,223 --> 00:03:22,531
of this switch.

51
00:03:22,531 --> 00:03:24,877
And the idea was to make the control
of the Space Shuttle

52
00:03:24,877 --> 00:03:27,972
as intuitive as possible,
but also as practical as possible,

53
00:03:27,972 --> 00:03:33,628
depending on your goals
and the kind of operation

54
00:03:33,628 --> 00:03:36,984
that you were performing
from the aft flight deck.

55
00:03:38,105 --> 00:03:42,304
Let's look now at the rotation
hand controller positive deflections,

56
00:03:42,304 --> 00:03:45,773
and we have the rotation hand controller.

57
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:48,159
This is all taken 
from the training documentation.

58
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,892
It's not extremely high resolution
but accept it as it is.

59
00:03:51,892 --> 00:03:57,156
This is pitch, and here 
we control the roll

60
00:03:58,460 --> 00:04:00,234
and here the yaw.

61
00:04:01,574 --> 00:04:04,544
So as opposed to an airplane,
the rotation hand controller

62
00:04:04,544 --> 00:04:08,620
had three axes of rotation,
pitch, roll and yaw.

63
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:11,036
On a normal airplane,
you only have pitch and roll.

64
00:04:11,036 --> 00:04:13,389
The yaw is controlled
with the rudder pedals.

65
00:04:13,389 --> 00:04:16,000
And, again, we always have
a reference direction

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,500
for the forward RHC.

67
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:23,155
I'm going to write this here,
"Ref direction"

68
00:04:23,155 --> 00:04:24,781
This is <i>+X</i>.

69
00:04:25,072 --> 00:04:32,480
Here we have the <i>-X</i> reference direction
and this is the <i>-Z</i>.

70
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:39,524
And if you are doing pitch inputs--

71
00:04:40,811 --> 00:04:43,354
Let's take this column here,
the pitch input

72
00:04:43,354 --> 00:04:46,089
from the forward flight deck.

73
00:04:46,089 --> 00:04:48,703
A positive pitch will give you, 
of course, a pitch up.

74
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:50,503
Though we understand that,
that's very intuitive

75
00:04:50,503 --> 00:04:51,943
like an airplane.

76
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:54,583
And if you have a positive roll,
you are going to roll to the right.

77
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:57,655
We know that,
and if you yaw positive

78
00:04:57,655 --> 00:05:00,282
with the rotation hand controller
not with the rudder pedals,

79
00:05:00,282 --> 00:05:03,448
you are going to have the yaw 
to the right, that's clear.

80
00:05:03,696 --> 00:05:07,419
Now if you add the aft flight deck
and you use the RHC

81
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:12,438
with a <i>-X</i> selection of the switch
that I talked about before,

82
00:05:12,438 --> 00:05:14,942
the reference direction is <i>-X</i>.

83
00:05:14,942 --> 00:05:20,796
So if you do positive pitch 
with a rotation hand controller,

84
00:05:20,796 --> 00:05:23,695
you are going to have the tail going up.

85
00:05:23,695 --> 00:05:25,108
We understand that.

86
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:28,297
If you do positive roll,
it's going to be, in fact,

87
00:05:28,297 --> 00:05:30,452
the negative roll of the orbiter.

88
00:05:30,452 --> 00:05:36,457
So the port wing is going to come down,
we understand that one,

89
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:38,826
so it's just opposite 
of what we had before

90
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:41,110
from the forward flight deck.

91
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:44,756
And if you do a yaw, a positive yaw
has got to take the tail

92
00:05:44,756 --> 00:05:45,842
to the right.

93
00:05:45,842 --> 00:05:47,236
We understand that one too.

94
00:05:47,236 --> 00:05:52,116
And if you take the <i>- Z</i> reference
in the last column,

95
00:05:53,676 --> 00:05:55,691
it's going to be the same for pitch.

96
00:05:55,691 --> 00:05:58,297
We understand that,
but a roll input

97
00:05:58,297 --> 00:06:01,850
on the rotation hand controller
is going to give you a yaw.

98
00:06:03,478 --> 00:06:08,049
And the yaw inputs 
on the rotation hand controller

99
00:06:08,049 --> 00:06:12,334
if you select the <i>-Z</i> reference direction
is going to give you an orbiter roll.

100
00:06:12,334 --> 00:06:19,544
So again, the idea was to have the inputs
as intuitive as possible

101
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:23,704
but have this capability to have either
from the aft flight deck,

102
00:06:23,704 --> 00:06:26,754
the <i>-X</i> or the <i>-Z</i> reference direction.

103
00:06:27,619 --> 00:06:29,716
On the two illustrations
on the right-hand side,

104
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:32,066
you see this reference directions
I talked about before.

105
00:06:32,066 --> 00:06:34,319
If you are forward, this is <i>+X</i> obviously.

106
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,859
And if you are 
in the aft flight deck, again,

107
00:06:37,859 --> 00:06:40,468
you can select as a reference
direction the <i>-X</i>,

108
00:06:40,468 --> 00:06:43,951
as we mentioned before,
or the <i>-Z</i>, looking up.

109
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,285
And again, you always operate
the rotation hand controller

110
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:51,044
or the translation hand controller
from the aft flight deck

111
00:06:51,044 --> 00:06:54,523
with its 45 degree inclination,
but in your mind you have

112
00:06:54,523 --> 00:06:57,546
to always think, "Do I have
as a reference direction,

113
00:06:57,546 --> 00:06:59,190
<i>-X</i> or <i>-Z</i>?"

114
00:07:00,676 --> 00:07:04,015
Let's take the case of the use
of the translation hand controller

115
00:07:04,015 --> 00:07:06,326
from the forward station, 
the aft station.

116
00:07:06,326 --> 00:07:12,810
Again, the ref direction is <i>+X</i>.

117
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:19,616
Here it's <i>-X</i>, then <i>-Z</i> here
depending on the position

118
00:07:19,616 --> 00:07:22,207
of the switch and the aft flight deck.

119
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:27,495
This is a translation hand controller
and the plus is a push,

120
00:07:28,405 --> 00:07:35,183
and here it's a down for plus,
as you see here.

121
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:40,465
And here it's right for plus.

122
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,586
And this is going to be 
from the forward flight deck,

123
00:07:44,586 --> 00:07:47,106
the reaction 
of the Space Shuttle obviously

124
00:07:47,106 --> 00:07:52,373
a push from the forward deck 
is going to perform a translation

125
00:07:52,373 --> 00:07:55,533
in the <i>+X</i> direction,
body direction of the Shuttle.

126
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:57,842
If you go down, it's going to go down.

127
00:07:57,842 --> 00:08:00,615
If you go to the right, 
it's going to the right.

128
00:08:00,615 --> 00:08:03,131
So this is all according to intuition.

129
00:08:03,633 --> 00:08:08,809
If you're on the back--
look at this column here--

130
00:08:08,809 --> 00:08:12,576
if you push, obviously
you're going to go toward the tail.

131
00:08:12,576 --> 00:08:14,248
We understand that.

132
00:08:14,248 --> 00:08:18,573
If you go down, you're also 
going to go down to the <i>+Z</i> direction.

133
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:22,992
And if you give an input to the right,

134
00:08:26,242 --> 00:08:30,172
it's going to be 
a displacement to the right,

135
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:33,668
looking toward the tail of the orbiter.

136
00:08:33,668 --> 00:08:35,182
We understand that one.

137
00:08:35,182 --> 00:08:39,788
If you're the <i>-Z</i> reference direction,
things will change.

138
00:08:41,048 --> 00:08:47,440
If you push you got to go
in the direction <i>-Z</i> to the top.

139
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:53,147
If you give an input down
to the translation hand controller,

140
00:08:53,147 --> 00:08:55,385
you're going to go toward the tail.

141
00:08:55,385 --> 00:09:00,225
We understand this one,
and if you give an input to the right,

142
00:09:00,225 --> 00:09:02,818
you're going in this direction.

143
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:05,657
So, again, it's all intuitive.

144
00:09:05,657 --> 00:09:08,431
You need to know when you're on the back
if you are working

145
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:11,506
with a <i>-X</i> or the <i>-Z</i> reference direction.
