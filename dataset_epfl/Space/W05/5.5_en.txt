We hope that you enjoyed this week with us.
Thank you for your participation in the course.
I would like you to focus on the concepts presented in this unit.
Once these concepts are clearly understood, including their application, you can take the final test of the unit.
We'd like to remind you of the focus on Hayabusa with the interview of Hitoshi Kuninaka from JAXA.
Hayabusa is an unmanned spacecraft developed by JAXA to return a sample of material from a small near-Earth asteroid,
25143, and named Itokawa.
The spacecraft was launched in 2003.
It made a rendezvous with Itokawa in 2005.
The collected samples were returned to Earth in 2010.
