Hello everyone, and welcome
to unit 6, "Human spaceflight".

2
00:00:10,563 --> 00:00:14,817
Behind me, in the background,
you see Baikonur, it's sunrise,

3
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:19,042
a beautiful day, preparation
for the launch of a Soyuz rocket

4
00:00:20,187 --> 00:00:22,092
a few days from now,

5
00:00:22,798 --> 00:00:26,451
with the astronauts and cosmonauts
to the International Space Station.

6
00:00:27,812 --> 00:00:31,984
This week, we'll talk about
6.2. the Space Shuttle;

7
00:00:31,984 --> 00:00:37,172
6.3. Space Shuttle selected mission
that will be addressed.

8
00:00:37,839 --> 00:00:42,025
6.4. will be ISS, including 
the access and the supply

9
00:00:42,025 --> 00:00:44,526
to the International Space Station,

10
00:00:45,414 --> 00:00:48,671
and we prepared some practice quizzes
after each video,

11
00:00:48,671 --> 00:00:52,412
to make sure that you understand
the relevant concepts.

12
00:00:52,878 --> 00:00:58,150
Each section from 6.2 to 6.4
is concluded with a control quiz.

13
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:01,169
In addition, there is a test
at the end of the unit.

14
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:04,387
To illustrate the unit, we have prepared

15
00:01:04,387 --> 00:01:07,322
a focus on space telescopes

16
00:01:07,322 --> 00:01:09,697
