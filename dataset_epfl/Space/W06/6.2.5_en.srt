1
00:00:04,042 --> 00:00:05,906
OK, we are in orbit now

2
00:00:05,906 --> 00:00:08,319
and this is inside the Space Shuttle.

3
00:00:09,135 --> 00:00:14,475
This is Eileen Collins, on STS63.

4
00:00:14,475 --> 00:00:20,181
This is the flight number 63
of the Space Shuttle in 1995,

5
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:21,152
and Eileen Collins

6
00:00:21,152 --> 00:00:24,554
was the first woman pilot
of the Space Shuttle,

7
00:00:24,555 --> 00:00:26,256
she flew twice as a pilot,

8
00:00:26,257 --> 00:00:28,252
and then she flew twice as a commander,

9
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:30,629
and she was
also the first woman commander

10
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,433
of the Space Shuttle program.

11
00:00:32,433 --> 00:00:34,871
And she seems to be sitting
in the pilot seat

12
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:37,146
--in fact, she's not really sitting,
she's just there,

13
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:38,260
there's weightlessness,

14
00:00:38,260 --> 00:00:40,223
so nobody is really sitting anywhere.

15
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:43,573
For instance, this is the same view
from the same point

16
00:00:43,574 --> 00:00:45,889
of the same seat, the pilot seat.

17
00:00:45,889 --> 00:00:47,444
As you see, nobody is sitting there,

18
00:00:47,444 --> 00:00:51,012
but you have two crew members
who are watching the Earth

19
00:00:51,013 --> 00:00:54,194
or something else,
through the forward windows,

20
00:00:54,194 --> 00:01:00,245
and this picture was taken
on my first flight STS46, in 1992.

21
00:01:00,245 --> 00:01:03,335
It's quite interesting,
because you see the feet up,

22
00:01:03,336 --> 00:01:07,089
and you can imagine that...
if you look at the upper portion here--

23
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,259
it could be dangerous
because you could change

24
00:01:10,259 --> 00:01:12,666
the switch position with your feet.

25
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:15,240
That's a reason why you can see this here,

26
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,945
you can see this here, also,

27
00:01:16,946 --> 00:01:18,581
all of the switches are guarded.

28
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:21,876
There is a metal loop
on both sides of the switch,

29
00:01:21,877 --> 00:01:23,664
so that if you have your feet there,

30
00:01:23,665 --> 00:01:26,719
it's very unlikely that you'll change
the position of the switch,

31
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:29,397
by inadvertent actuation.

32
00:01:29,397 --> 00:01:32,731
Another thing I would like to show,
are the Velcro patches here.

33
00:01:32,731 --> 00:01:36,628
You see all the these pale blue patches

34
00:01:36,628 --> 00:01:39,066
are Velcro patches,

35
00:01:39,066 --> 00:01:41,839
and this, in a way, replaces the tables;

36
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,293
if you have an object, you want
to put somewhere,

37
00:01:45,293 --> 00:01:46,673
you want it to stay there,

38
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,067
you put it on a Velcro patch.

39
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:52,016
Of course, you need to have
a Velcro to Velcro interface.

40
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:54,790
But this is a way we can have things

41
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:57,278
put somewhere, and they stay there.

42
00:01:57,278 --> 00:01:59,793
This is a crew member
in the up flight deck,

43
00:01:59,793 --> 00:02:03,992
He just prepared scrambled eggs
for the rest of the crew

44
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:08,085
and there are the scrambled egg patches;

45
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,574
of course, originally, they were

46
00:02:10,574 --> 00:02:13,637
dried, or dehydrated scrambled eggs,

47
00:02:13,638 --> 00:02:16,082
like a yellow powder in plastic pouches,

48
00:02:16,083 --> 00:02:18,836
but they were re-hydrated with
the proper amount of water,

49
00:02:18,836 --> 00:02:22,391
and by they way, you see also
the Velcro patches here.

50
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:25,281
So, after the preparation of the food,

51
00:02:25,282 --> 00:02:29,301
the food can be stored somewhere
on the wall, so that it stays there.

52
00:02:29,302 --> 00:02:32,251
You have Hasselblad cameras,
that also have Velcro patches

53
00:02:32,263 --> 00:02:34,245
--another Hasselblad camera here --

54
00:02:34,246 --> 00:02:37,901
and by the way, here, you have
the flight plan with the orbits.

55
00:02:37,902 --> 00:02:41,518
You see one, two, three, four orbits,
one orbit after the other,

56
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,332
displaced, as you all know,
about 22 and a half degrees;

57
00:02:45,332 --> 00:02:47,295
versus the previous one.

58
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:50,172
So this is a nice view of a crew member

59
00:02:50,172 --> 00:02:52,273
having prepared food
for the rest of the crew

60
00:02:52,273 --> 00:02:53,612
in the up flight deck.

61
00:02:53,612 --> 00:02:55,630
Now, we get toward the end of the mission,

62
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:58,188
it's time to get ready for the re-entry,

63
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:02,155
and we had to wear
our launch-and-entry suits,

64
00:03:02,156 --> 00:03:04,793
the LES orange suits,

65
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,985
that were providing protection

66
00:03:06,986 --> 00:03:10,858
in case of the crew
having to escape the orbiter;

67
00:03:10,858 --> 00:03:12,955
that it was always that possibility

68
00:03:12,955 --> 00:03:15,578
going through an exploded hatch.

69
00:03:15,579 --> 00:03:18,599
In case the orbiter,
for one reason or another,

70
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,771
could not reach the landing runaway,

71
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:23,668
that it was a possibility
for the crew to escape this way.

72
00:03:23,668 --> 00:03:25,563
And you see a parachute here,

73
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:28,102
so you have the commander,
on the left-hand seat,

74
00:03:28,102 --> 00:03:30,853
you have the pilot, getting ready
on the right-hand seat,

75
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:33,817
and the mission specialist
number two, on the left-hand side,

76
00:03:33,817 --> 00:03:37,309
also getting ready to don
the launch-and-entry suit

77
00:03:37,309 --> 00:03:39,036
and prepare for the entry.

78
00:03:39,414 --> 00:03:43,083
This is a view from
the mission specialist number two

79
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:45,710
on the flight engineer seats,

80
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:49,111
between the commander on the left,
and the pilot on the right,

81
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:51,388
of a night re-entry.

82
00:03:51,389 --> 00:03:54,516
And it's interesting to say
that it's not re-entry

83
00:03:54,517 --> 00:03:57,380
because through the windows,
you see it's very bright,

84
00:03:57,972 --> 00:04:02,050
and the reason is this is during
the very hot phase of the re-entry

85
00:04:02,051 --> 00:04:05,664
between about 80 km altitude
and 50 km.

86
00:04:05,664 --> 00:04:11,853
We had about 10 minutes of generation
of a lot of heat outside,

87
00:04:11,853 --> 00:04:14,915
because of the friction of the orbiter
coming in the atmosphere

88
00:04:14,915 --> 00:04:18,360
26 times the speed of sound
with the higher layers of the atmosphere.

89
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,748
Everything was under control,

90
00:04:19,748 --> 00:04:22,182
the orbiter had a high angle of attack
at that time,

91
00:04:22,182 --> 00:04:24,029
about 40 degrees angle of attack.

92
00:04:24,029 --> 00:04:26,910
The idea was to brake in the higher layers
of the atmosphere

93
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:29,526
so as to enter the lower layers
of the atmosphere

94
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:30,893
at a lower speed,

95
00:04:30,894 --> 00:04:33,252
so we could control, on one hand,

96
00:04:33,253 --> 00:04:35,747
the heating and the trajectory
of the spaceship.

97
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:38,963
This view of the re-entry
of the space shuttle

98
00:04:38,964 --> 00:04:40,774
from the International Space Station.

99
00:04:40,774 --> 00:04:43,011
This was on the occasion

100
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:45,310
of one of the last flights
of the Space Shuttle,

101
00:04:45,311 --> 00:04:49,376
when it was taking part
in the assembly sequence

102
00:04:49,377 --> 00:04:51,220
of the International Space Station.

103
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:55,793
And after separation from ISS,
and the orbiter burn,

104
00:04:55,806 --> 00:04:57,609
we see, from the Space Station,

105
00:04:57,609 --> 00:04:59,497
the Shuttle re-entry in the atmosphere,

106
00:04:59,497 --> 00:05:03,228
pretty much like a shooting star,
or a fire ball.

107
00:05:03,228 --> 00:05:08,395
This is a clear indication
of the very hot part of the re-entry

108
00:05:08,396 --> 00:05:11,194
with temperatures, typically
of the order of 1,000 degrees

109
00:05:11,194 --> 00:05:13,809
outside of the spaceship.

110
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:18,017
And then, there was a wake
of hot gases plasma forming

111
00:05:18,018 --> 00:05:21,064
around the Shuttle,
and in the back of the Shuttle.

112
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:24,728
Quite a nice view; you see
the Earth illuminated by the Moon,

113
00:05:24,729 --> 00:05:26,634
you see the so-called airglow,

114
00:05:26,634 --> 00:05:31,335
this layer of the luminescence
in the high atmosphere

115
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:33,797
about 100 kilometers altitude,

116
00:05:33,798 --> 00:05:36,561
and see some stars in the sky;
it's a beautiful view.

117
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:40,445
We've gone through the transition
from the re-entry in the atmosphere,

118
00:05:40,445 --> 00:05:41,711
the hot part,

119
00:05:41,712 --> 00:05:45,704
to the gliding parts of the re-entry.

120
00:05:45,705 --> 00:05:49,334
There were no motors,
no engines on the Shuttle,

121
00:05:49,335 --> 00:05:51,226
for the last part of the re-entry.

122
00:05:51,226 --> 00:05:53,923
We are now on the so called
steep glide slope

123
00:05:53,924 --> 00:05:56,460
about 20 degrees angle,

124
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,416
towards landing runaway

125
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,115
at Kennedy Space Center, Florida.

126
00:06:01,115 --> 00:06:04,606
This is the view that the commander
and the pilot had

127
00:06:04,606 --> 00:06:06,981
through the so-called
head-up display.

128
00:06:06,982 --> 00:06:11,390
It was a 45-degree-located,
semi-transparent glass

129
00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:12,768
in front of them,

130
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:15,114
and through the head-up display
the crew could see

131
00:06:15,115 --> 00:06:17,795
the landscape, on one hand,
and the runway in particular,

132
00:06:17,795 --> 00:06:21,249
but also projected has some
information about guidance,

133
00:06:21,249 --> 00:06:24,561
and about the speed
--this is the air speed--

134
00:06:28,149 --> 00:06:30,567
about 300 knots on the outer glass slope.

135
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:34,308
You have here the altitude,
in thousands of feet,

136
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:43,061
here we are at about 5,000 feet.

137
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:47,983
And here, you have, the indication
of the position of the velocity vector

138
00:06:47,984 --> 00:06:49,585
of the Space Shuttle.

139
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,720
The Space Shuttle is going
in that direction,

140
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,962
and this is a guidance symbol here.

141
00:06:53,962 --> 00:06:59,030
The crew had to try to put
the velocity vector

142
00:06:59,031 --> 00:07:01,823
inside the guidance symbol

143
00:07:01,824 --> 00:07:05,235
so the idea was to move the stick down,
a little bit to the right,

144
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:08,251
in order to put the velocity vector
in the guidance symbol.

145
00:07:08,252 --> 00:07:12,841
This was a help for the crew
to manually perform,

146
00:07:12,842 --> 00:07:14,786
in a satisfactory manner

147
00:07:14,787 --> 00:07:17,551
the final approach to the runaway

148
00:07:17,551 --> 00:07:21,565
ended up with the landing touchdown
on the 5 km-long runaway

149
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,477
at the Kennedy Space Center.

150
00:07:23,477 --> 00:07:26,613
And that's the landing
right after main wheel touchdown

151
00:07:26,614 --> 00:07:29,839
which was about 190 to 200 knots.

152
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:34,362
There was a deployment
of the brake chute which you see here,

153
00:07:34,362 --> 00:07:36,721
and then, there was a slow slap-down;

154
00:07:36,722 --> 00:07:38,828
the nose of the orbiter was coming down

155
00:07:38,828 --> 00:07:42,071
until nose wheel touch down,
which just occurred.

156
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:44,601
You see the smoke here coming
from the nose wheel touch down.

157
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:46,589
And the brake chute was there

158
00:07:46,589 --> 00:07:48,578
in order to reduce
the rolling distance.

159
00:07:48,578 --> 00:07:51,868
You see also something interesting:
this is a speed brake here,

160
00:07:51,868 --> 00:07:53,570
and during the approach,

161
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:56,500
the speed brake is normally
at about half deployment,

162
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:59,189
giving the crew the capability

163
00:07:59,189 --> 00:08:03,354
to either steepen the approach
or make it a little bit flatter,

164
00:08:03,354 --> 00:08:05,668
the idea was always to give the crew

165
00:08:05,668 --> 00:08:08,677
a possibility to correct
in one direction or the other.

166
00:08:08,677 --> 00:08:11,647
The landing phase was of course
supported heavily

167
00:08:11,647 --> 00:08:14,157
by mission control center in Houston.

168
00:08:14,158 --> 00:08:18,095
You see on the front wall a display
of the horizontal situation

169
00:08:18,096 --> 00:08:20,427
and the vertical situation here,

170
00:08:20,428 --> 00:08:23,226
with an indication of the energy level.

171
00:08:23,227 --> 00:08:25,825
This is a position of the flight director

172
00:08:25,826 --> 00:08:27,705
and on the right of the flight director

173
00:08:27,709 --> 00:08:30,499
you have the cap-com
or the communicator with the crew.

174
00:08:30,499 --> 00:08:34,333
Post landing there was some immediate
processing of the orbiter,

175
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:35,957
on the runaway itself,

176
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:40,662
and the latest stage it was pushed
into this so-called OPF,

177
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:43,192
Orbiter Processing Facility,

178
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:46,328
where it was lifted up,
as we can see here.

179
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:48,828
The nose wheel is no longer
touching the ground

180
00:08:48,828 --> 00:08:51,851
and there was a lot of scaffolding
put around the orbiter,

181
00:08:51,851 --> 00:08:55,487
and there was a lot of maintenance
done during several months normally,

182
00:08:55,488 --> 00:08:58,840
from one landing to the next,

183
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:03,195
stacking in the vehicle assembly building.

184
00:09:03,196 --> 00:09:06,359
And you see the complexity
of all the hardware around the orbiter

185
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,797
for the maintenance between flights.

186
00:09:09,073 --> 00:09:11,652
In particular, there was
quite a lot of work needed

187
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,340
on the thermal protection system.

188
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,392
There were about 30,000 of these tiles;

189
00:09:16,392 --> 00:09:19,139
most of them at the bottom
of the orbiter,

190
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:23,781
and some of them had to be either repaired
or exchanged as you can see here.

191
00:09:24,641 --> 00:09:29,661
Well, this is the very last landing
of the Space Shuttle, STS135,

192
00:09:29,662 --> 00:09:31,564
flight number 135 of the Space Shuttle,

193
00:09:31,564 --> 00:09:34,715
that was in July, 2011,

194
00:09:34,716 --> 00:09:38,668
it was the last flight
of the visits and assembly

195
00:09:38,668 --> 00:09:40,417
of the International Space Station

196
00:09:40,417 --> 00:09:41,769
a night landing.

197
00:09:41,769 --> 00:09:45,608
Quite an emotional moment
because the program had started

198
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:50,381
about 30 years earlier, in 1981,
135 flights,

199
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,103
The program had allowed the Hubble Program

200
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:55,420
that we'll talk about later,

201
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:58,661
had allowed also the assembly
of the International Space Station.

202
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:01,248
Most of the elements,
apart from the Russian elements

203
00:10:01,248 --> 00:10:04,623
had been brought to orbit
by the Space Shuttle.

204
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:10,876
It had allowed also 355 astronauts
to go in space during these 30 years,

205
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,832
so quite a successful program.

206
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:17,020
Unfortunately, we had two major accidents
in this program:

207
00:10:17,611 --> 00:10:22,196
Challenger, in 1986,
and Columbia in 2003,

208
00:10:22,197 --> 00:10:24,315
and we'll talk about these
in the next videos.
