1
00:00:05,196 --> 00:00:07,692
The Space Shuttle was developed in the US,

2
00:00:07,692 --> 00:00:10,635
already at the end of the Apollo program,

3
00:00:10,635 --> 00:00:12,386
so before 1972.

4
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:17,189
The last Apollo program flight
was Apollo 17, December 1972,

5
00:00:17,189 --> 00:00:21,605
but before that time already,
the US government and NASA had in mind

6
00:00:21,605 --> 00:00:26,825
to develop, to test, to operate
a winged spacecraft,

7
00:00:26,825 --> 00:00:30,360
a reusable spacecraft for access
to low Earth orbit,

8
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:35,825
and the idea was to launch
commercial payloads

9
00:00:35,825 --> 00:00:40,797
to use it also for the needs
of the Department of Defense

10
00:00:40,797 --> 00:00:45,377
and also to do space exploration
and utilization, using the same vehicle,

11
00:00:45,377 --> 00:00:49,766
that was going to replace
basically all of the nonreusable rockets

12
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:52,231
that had been used until that time.

13
00:00:52,231 --> 00:00:55,472
Several concepts were looked at
for the design of the Space Shuttle

14
00:00:55,472 --> 00:00:57,042
in the early 70s.

15
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:59,895
It was really a dream
for aerospace engineers

16
00:00:59,895 --> 00:01:04,264
because they were started
with nearly a blank sheet

17
00:01:04,264 --> 00:01:07,400
and they had to think about
the geometry of it.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,453
Initially, the idea was
a fully reusable spacecraft,

19
00:01:10,453 --> 00:01:13,959
a two-stage spacecraft
for access to low Earth orbit.

20
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:18,096
This is one of the geometries
that was thought about;

21
00:01:18,096 --> 00:01:21,424
basically here you have
the first stage,

22
00:01:21,424 --> 00:01:25,731
with the LH2 and LO2, the propellants,

23
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:28,083
cryogenic engines in the back.

24
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:30,199
And then, the second stage was going to be

25
00:01:30,199 --> 00:01:31,558
the orbiter itself.

26
00:01:31,558 --> 00:01:35,147
But you will see
in all of the next few drawings

27
00:01:35,147 --> 00:01:39,233
the cargo bay, the size of the payload bay
or cargo bay was really determined

28
00:01:39,233 --> 00:01:42,810
by the Department of Defense.

29
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:46,699
The plan was to use it
for this department,

30
00:01:46,699 --> 00:01:50,745
and they had strict requirements
in terms of the size and also capability

31
00:01:50,745 --> 00:01:55,049
in mass of the content of the payload bay.

32
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,854
This is another concept that was
looked at, an alternative approach.

33
00:01:58,854 --> 00:02:00,927
You see again, two stages:

34
00:02:00,927 --> 00:02:05,813
here you see, solid rocket boosters
that are attached to the second stage,

35
00:02:05,813 --> 00:02:09,878
so that was just
another concept looked at.

36
00:02:09,878 --> 00:02:12,592
Third concept that was presented:

37
00:02:12,592 --> 00:02:16,348
this was the so-called
High Cross Range System.

38
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:23,224
The Cross Range is the capability
to land outside of the plane of the orbit,

39
00:02:23,224 --> 00:02:24,744
the initial orbit.

40
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,811
You can imagine
if you have a winged spacecraft

41
00:02:26,811 --> 00:02:28,931
during the descent in the atmosphere,

42
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:30,450
you can give a back angle,

43
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:32,224
so that you can eventually land

44
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:37,938
pretty far away form the intersection
of the plane of the orbit with the Earth,

45
00:02:37,938 --> 00:02:42,448
a few hundred miles away
from this line.

46
00:02:42,448 --> 00:02:45,632
And this was also a requirement
of the Department of Defense;

47
00:02:45,632 --> 00:02:48,291
they wanted to have a large cross range

48
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:51,362
in order to give more flexibility
for the landing site.

49
00:02:51,362 --> 00:02:54,450
Now, this is an interesting curve:

50
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:56,458
the costs trade-off.

51
00:02:57,548 --> 00:03:00,122
On the horizontal line,
you have the developed cost;

52
00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:05,533
on the vertical line, the cost per flight.

53
00:03:05,533 --> 00:03:08,128
Now, don't look really
at the numbers there,

54
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:13,380
here you have billions of dollars
on the horizontal scale,

55
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:16,498
and millions on the vertical scale.

56
00:03:16,498 --> 00:03:19,061
But look more at the shape of the curve:

57
00:03:19,061 --> 00:03:22,947
you can spend much more money
for development,

58
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:26,758
in order to get spacecraft, in our case

59
00:03:26,758 --> 00:03:30,725
that will have relatively
low costs per flight.

60
00:03:30,725 --> 00:03:35,569
Typically, the fully reusable spacecraft
that it was looked at originally

61
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:37,934
in the Shuttle Program development,

62
00:03:38,764 --> 00:03:43,615
was going to induce
quite high development cost

63
00:03:43,615 --> 00:03:45,981
for a relatively low operation cost,

64
00:03:45,981 --> 00:03:48,549
because everything
was going to be reusable.

65
00:03:48,549 --> 00:03:50,752
But because of budget limitations,

66
00:03:50,752 --> 00:03:56,196
eventually, NASA, the US government
had to cut it off

67
00:03:56,196 --> 00:03:59,848
at the lower point of the horizontal axis,

68
00:03:59,848 --> 00:04:02,333
which mean less development costs

69
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:07,053
but that was going to mean
a higher cost per flights,

70
00:04:07,053 --> 00:04:12,107
and the final configuration
of the Space Shuttle that was chosen

71
00:04:12,107 --> 00:04:14,081
was only partially reusable,

72
00:04:14,081 --> 00:04:16,815
less development costs,
but more costs per flight.

73
00:04:16,815 --> 00:04:21,311
The chosen configuration, let's look
at what we have on the right-hand side,

74
00:04:21,311 --> 00:04:24,043
the Space Shuttle, with the external tank,

75
00:04:24,043 --> 00:04:26,789
the solid rocket boosters
on the launch pad

76
00:04:26,789 --> 00:04:30,977
just after the faring
of the Space Shuttle main engines,

77
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:33,989
and before the solid rocket boosters
are ignited.

78
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:36,819
You have here the Orbiter.

79
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:45,095
Again, with the large payload bay
that was a requirement of the DOD,

80
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:49,062
in the front, you have the cabin
for up to seven crew members.

81
00:04:50,242 --> 00:04:51,829
In the back of the Orbiter

82
00:04:51,829 --> 00:04:56,253
you have the Space Shuttle main engine,

83
00:04:58,028 --> 00:05:00,725
O2 plus H2, cryogenic engines,

84
00:05:01,322 --> 00:05:02,500
there are three of them;

85
00:05:04,762 --> 00:05:06,775
and here you have the external tank,

86
00:05:07,976 --> 00:05:12,214
containing about 700 tons
of liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen,

87
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:15,396
to feed the three
Space Shuttle main engines.

88
00:05:15,396 --> 00:05:22,751
And here you have two SRBs,
solid rocket boosters

89
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:28,392
that provide in fact the highest fraction
of the thrust for the initial launch

90
00:05:28,392 --> 00:05:30,932
all the way to about 2 minutes
into the launch

91
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:34,339
where they are fully burned out
and they are jettisoned

92
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:35,949
and fall down in the ocean.

93
00:05:35,949 --> 00:05:37,928
They could be recovered by boats,

94
00:05:37,928 --> 00:05:39,691
and they are reused on later flights

95
00:05:39,691 --> 00:05:42,105
but after quite a lot of refurbishment.

96
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:44,250
So the Orbiter and the external tank

97
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,620
work continuing the ascent
to main engine cutt-off

98
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,081
which is about 8.5 minutes
after lift-off.

99
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:53,372
Let's look at what we have
on the left here:

100
00:05:53,372 --> 00:05:55,726
you see the the view from the front,

101
00:05:55,726 --> 00:05:57,813
the rear, the top, the bottom,

102
00:05:57,813 --> 00:06:00,190
and the side of the Orbiter.

103
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:02,605
All of the black parts,

104
00:06:02,605 --> 00:06:05,089
TPS,

105
00:06:05,513 --> 00:06:07,992
several protection system tiles,

106
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:10,282
that are able to resist
the high temperature

107
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:11,431
during the re-entry,

108
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:14,288
obviously because of the configuration
during the re-entry

109
00:06:14,288 --> 00:06:17,766
or the orientation, which was
a high angle of attack,

110
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:18,991
about 40 degrees.

111
00:06:18,991 --> 00:06:22,199
The heating was mainly
in the nose of the Orbiter,

112
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:24,031
the leading edge of the wings,

113
00:06:24,031 --> 00:06:26,804
and also, of course,
the whole bottom of the Orbiter

114
00:06:26,804 --> 00:06:30,232
that's why the black parts are
in the bottom of the wing,

115
00:06:30,232 --> 00:06:32,475
and also, at the nose of fuselage

116
00:06:32,475 --> 00:06:35,519
and covering the side of the fuselage
up to a certain height.

117
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:40,990
The white areas were also covered
with thermal protection tiles,

118
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,188
but not with the same capabilities
that the black ones.

119
00:06:44,793 --> 00:06:47,017
Now the idea the of the Space Shuttle

120
00:06:47,017 --> 00:06:49,014
was, of course, to come back
from orbit,

121
00:06:49,014 --> 00:06:51,851
and eventually, come for a soft landing

122
00:06:51,851 --> 00:06:53,898
in a runway at the Kennedy Space Center

123
00:06:53,898 --> 00:06:56,019
which is also the launch site, in Florida.

124
00:06:56,019 --> 00:06:59,958
And before the final design,

125
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:05,258
it was necessary to test
the capability of the spaceship

126
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,968
which, in a way, at the end of the mission
was becoming a bit lighter,

127
00:07:08,968 --> 00:07:12,655
to do a satisfactory approach
and landing on the runway.

128
00:07:13,344 --> 00:07:16,006
And this is the so-called
approach and landing test

129
00:07:16,006 --> 00:07:18,389
that was performed in 1977

130
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:21,427
at the Dryden Research Center

131
00:07:21,427 --> 00:07:24,917
which is a NASA center attached
to the Edwards Air force base

132
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:26,236
in California.

133
00:07:26,236 --> 00:07:30,534
And for this, it was the Enterprise
Space Shuttle that it was used

134
00:07:30,534 --> 00:07:34,344
which had all of the avionics,
and the landing gear,

135
00:07:34,344 --> 00:07:37,985
and the guidance navigation system
for the final approach,

136
00:07:37,985 --> 00:07:40,695
and, of course, the structure of the Orbit,

137
00:07:40,695 --> 00:07:43,478
but it did not have
the thermal protection tiles.

138
00:07:43,478 --> 00:07:46,872
And also, in the rear of the Enterprise,

139
00:07:46,872 --> 00:07:49,388
it didn't have the real cryogenic engines

140
00:07:49,388 --> 00:07:50,823
that were not needed,

141
00:07:50,823 --> 00:07:53,396
and the pods, this is a pod,

142
00:07:54,448 --> 00:07:57,790
containing fuel
for the on-orbit maneuvering system.

143
00:07:57,790 --> 00:07:59,298
Was just there, physically,

144
00:07:59,298 --> 00:08:00,938
but, of course, there was nothing inside,

145
00:08:00,938 --> 00:08:04,098
so the idea was to test only
the final approach and landing

146
00:08:04,098 --> 00:08:05,628
on the runway at Edwards,

147
00:08:05,628 --> 00:08:07,278
or on any runway for that matter.

148
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,258
And we had four crew members

149
00:08:10,258 --> 00:08:13,391
who were active
in this approach and landing test.

150
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:15,873
From left to right, we have:

151
00:08:15,873 --> 00:08:18,290
Gordon Fullerton, Fred Haise,

152
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:21,271
who is the only one among the four
who had gone in space,

153
00:08:21,271 --> 00:08:23,252
in fact on the Apollo 13,

154
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,991
and Joe Engle, and Dick Truly.

155
00:08:25,991 --> 00:08:29,615
These were the four crew members
assigned to approach-and-landing test

156
00:08:29,615 --> 00:08:32,218
of the Space Shuttle Enterprise.

157
00:08:32,798 --> 00:08:34,450
So this was the configuration used

158
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:38,207
for bringing the Space Shuttle Enterprise

159
00:08:38,207 --> 00:08:42,201
in relatively high atmosphere,

160
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:44,285
a few kilometers above the Earth surface;

161
00:08:44,285 --> 00:08:49,870
and the first tests were done
with a captive Enterprise.

162
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:52,188
There was here, a tail cone,

163
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:55,164
in the back of the Orbiter,

164
00:08:55,164 --> 00:08:56,700
in order to reduce the drag,

165
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:59,536
and also bring less turbulence
toward the tail,

166
00:08:59,536 --> 00:09:01,969
at the so-called Shuttle Carrier Aircraft

167
00:09:01,969 --> 00:09:04,836
which is a modified Boeing 747,

168
00:09:04,836 --> 00:09:06,825
which belonged to NASA.

169
00:09:06,825 --> 00:09:12,421
So this is a way the Enterprise spaceship
was taken in the atmosphere

170
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,542
for the approach and landing test.

171
00:09:14,542 --> 00:09:16,931
And here we see the first free flight,

172
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:21,167
again with the tail cone on
of the Space Shuttle Enterprise,

173
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,110
and the idea was to verify again,

174
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:26,128
the proper alignment
on the runway.

175
00:09:26,532 --> 00:09:28,558
Pretty steep glide slope, about 20 degrees,

176
00:09:28,558 --> 00:09:30,918
a much larger angle of approach

177
00:09:30,918 --> 00:09:33,001
than we have
with the commercial airliners,

178
00:09:33,001 --> 00:09:35,035
or any military airplane.

179
00:09:36,175 --> 00:09:39,475
This is the final turn
towards alignment with the runway

180
00:09:39,475 --> 00:09:43,837
and, eventually, we had deployment
of the landing gear very late,

181
00:09:43,837 --> 00:09:46,082
the idea was to deploy the gear late,

182
00:09:46,082 --> 00:09:50,180
so that we didn't have too early
the considerable drag

183
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:52,537
that the landing gear was causing.

184
00:09:52,724 --> 00:09:54,714
And then, landing on the runway.

185
00:09:54,714 --> 00:09:58,219
Here we see the configuration
of the Enterprise without the tail cone,

186
00:09:59,759 --> 00:10:03,299
NASA decided obviously that we had
at some point a test configuration

187
00:10:03,299 --> 00:10:05,282
and it worked fine, also.

188
00:10:05,282 --> 00:10:08,133
The angle of approach
was just a little bit steeper

189
00:10:08,133 --> 00:10:10,498
but here, we just see the detachment

190
00:10:10,498 --> 00:10:14,399
of Enterprise
from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft

191
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,535
and this all had to be planned properly

192
00:10:16,535 --> 00:10:20,256
because there was a certain angle
of dive of the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft

193
00:10:20,256 --> 00:10:22,627
and there was a generation of lifts

194
00:10:22,627 --> 00:10:24,545
on the wings of the Enterprise,

195
00:10:24,545 --> 00:10:26,247
and then it could be detached,

196
00:10:26,247 --> 00:10:28,303
and it was coming up

197
00:10:28,303 --> 00:10:32,221
over the top part
of the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft

198
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:34,611
and avoiding contact with the tail.

199
00:10:34,611 --> 00:10:38,569
There were a total of two landings done

200
00:10:38,569 --> 00:10:41,063
at the Dryden Research Center

201
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:43,607
with the configuration tail cone off,

202
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:47,110
and this is the very last landing
of the Enterprise.

203
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:53,000
It landed initially on the dried lakebed

204
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,725
which is very big, about 25 km in length,

205
00:10:56,725 --> 00:10:58,914
but the last landing
was done on the runway

206
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:01,946
at Edwards Air Force base,
or Dryden Research Center.

207
00:11:02,490 --> 00:11:06,126
And you see here,
this is very classical

208
00:11:06,126 --> 00:11:09,981
for tested airplanes
or tested winged spaceships like this one,

209
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:13,613
it's a probe in order to measure
the air data in front of the fuselage.

210
00:11:13,613 --> 00:11:17,606
Obviously, for the Space Shuttle,

211
00:11:17,614 --> 00:11:22,584
later Columbia, and the others,
we didn't have that probe anymore.
