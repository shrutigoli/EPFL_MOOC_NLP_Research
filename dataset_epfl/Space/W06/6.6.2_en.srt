1
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,042
Yes, I'm John Mather.

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:11,275
I'm the Senior Project Scientist
for the James Webb Space Telescope,

3
00:00:11,395 --> 00:00:13,958
and I work here
at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center

4
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:17,107
in Greenbelt, Maryland,
just outside Washington, D.C.

5
00:00:20,386 --> 00:00:23,524
James Webb Telescope
is the planned successor

6
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,575
for the great Hubble Space Telescope.

7
00:00:25,639 --> 00:00:30,269
That's an infrared optimized telescope
much larger than the Hubble.

8
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:35,746
It's being produced
by the international partnership of NASA

9
00:00:35,747 --> 00:00:39,012
with the European and Canadian
Space Agencies, all contributing.

10
00:00:39,518 --> 00:00:43,525
It's optimized for infrared astronomy.
It's extremely large.

11
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:47,557
It will unfold in our space
because it's larger than a rocket.

12
00:00:47,558 --> 00:00:50,288
Then of course, it's aimed to do
scientific discoveries

13
00:00:50,289 --> 00:00:55,756
that have not been made yet,
but will presumably be extremely exciting.

14
00:00:58,922 --> 00:01:02,556
We started thinking about
the James Webb Space Telescope

15
00:01:02,557 --> 00:01:05,568
back in October of 1995--

16
00:01:05,569 --> 00:01:07,866
although that isn't really
the very first moment--

17
00:01:07,986 --> 00:01:10,505
but that's when we started working
on the telescope.

18
00:01:10,506 --> 00:01:15,983
We chose the teams
to work on the telescope in 2002.

19
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:19,075
Launch is scheduled for October 2018.

20
00:01:19,996 --> 00:01:23,015
We expect the operations
for scientific observations

21
00:01:23,016 --> 00:01:25,087
to begin in April 2019,

22
00:01:25,088 --> 00:01:27,964
and we're carrying the fuel
to make the observatory run

23
00:01:27,965 --> 00:01:30,963
as through April of 2029 at least.

24
00:01:35,175 --> 00:01:40,058
There are four main scientific themes
the observatory has designed to address.

25
00:01:40,059 --> 00:01:42,107
The first one is:

26
00:01:42,798 --> 00:01:46,799
what were the first objects that formed
after the Big Bang?

27
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:50,501
They could've been stars,
or galaxies, or black holes.

28
00:01:50,515 --> 00:01:53,536
So we'd like to find
that out by observing.

29
00:01:53,537 --> 00:01:58,025
We have many, many predictions
from theoretical approaches to astronomy,

30
00:01:58,026 --> 00:02:02,113
but nature has this capability
of surprising us every day.

31
00:02:02,113 --> 00:02:03,991
So we need to go look.

32
00:02:04,963 --> 00:02:06,533
How do the galaxies grow?

33
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:09,734
We know that the Milky Way Galaxy
has been made

34
00:02:09,735 --> 00:02:11,884
by assembling many smaller pieces.

35
00:02:12,445 --> 00:02:15,173
We know that galaxies collide
with each other quite often

36
00:02:15,174 --> 00:02:20,388
in the early universe,
and that the history is quite chaotic.

37
00:02:20,389 --> 00:02:23,206
We now have beautiful
numerical simulations

38
00:02:23,206 --> 00:02:27,251
made in super computers
that show how galaxies might grow.

39
00:02:27,888 --> 00:02:30,346
But the big question for astronomers is:

40
00:02:30,347 --> 00:02:32,692
are the simulations 
anywhere close to correct

41
00:02:32,693 --> 00:02:36,721
or are there some big surprises
still lurking out there in nature?

42
00:02:37,486 --> 00:02:39,411
Our third scene that we have is:

43
00:02:39,412 --> 00:02:43,098
how are the stars and planetary systems
being born today?

44
00:02:43,099 --> 00:02:46,160
Stars like the Sun
and solar systems like ours;

45
00:02:46,161 --> 00:02:51,995
these are happening nearby
in dusty gas clouds not far away.

46
00:02:51,996 --> 00:02:55,758
They could be observed much better
with Webb Space Telescope

47
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:57,902
than with previous equipment.

48
00:02:57,903 --> 00:03:02,214
Partly because the dust grains that make
the formation of the stars possible

49
00:03:02,215 --> 00:03:07,101
also steer the view and prevent us
from seeing inside these beautiful clouds.

50
00:03:07,866 --> 00:03:09,427
Fourth theme is:

51
00:03:09,428 --> 00:03:12,364
How do planetary systems 
evolve over time

52
00:03:12,365 --> 00:03:16,893
and how does it become possible
for life to exist on some of them

53
00:03:16,894 --> 00:03:18,479
like here on Earth?

54
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,270
We know now that there are about
as many planetary systems

55
00:03:22,271 --> 00:03:23,711
as there are stars.

56
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:25,571
Most stars have planets.

57
00:03:26,311 --> 00:03:28,076
Some of them have many planets.

58
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:32,504
How are they evolving with time?

59
00:03:32,505 --> 00:03:34,704
How is it possible, for instance,

60
00:03:34,704 --> 00:03:38,758
that Earth has just the right amount
of continents and oceans,

61
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:42,356
the chemical constituents
that make it possible for us to live here?

62
00:03:42,356 --> 00:03:47,536
All of these things are key topics
for future observers with the telescope.

63
00:03:53,076 --> 00:03:56,419
The James Webb Space Telescope
is much larger

64
00:03:56,420 --> 00:03:58,192
than the Hubble Space Telescope.

65
00:03:58,192 --> 00:04:02,983
It has seven times the collecting area
as a six-and-a-half meter aperture

66
00:04:02,984 --> 00:04:07,492
as compared to the 2.4 meter aperture
of the Hubble Telescope.

67
00:04:07,493 --> 00:04:09,700
It is cooled down to a low temperature,

68
00:04:09,701 --> 00:04:12,965
approximately one-seventh
of the absolute temperature in Kelvin.

69
00:04:13,496 --> 00:04:18,117
The Hubble Space Telescope runs
at room temperature about 300 Kelvin,

70
00:04:18,118 --> 00:04:22,348
and the James Webb Telescope
has instruments around 40 degrees Kelvin.

71
00:04:22,935 --> 00:04:26,890
It even has one instrument 
much colder, at around six Kelvin.

72
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:31,233
The observatory is optimized for 
observing at infrared wavelengths

73
00:04:31,234 --> 00:04:34,577
beginning with actually red
that you could see with your eye,

74
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:38,806
the 0.6 microns and running out
to 28 microns wavelengths.

75
00:04:38,807 --> 00:04:40,844
The Hubble Telescope by comparison

76
00:04:40,845 --> 00:04:46,073
covers approximately 0.1
to 1.7 microns in wavelengths;

77
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:50,105
very different than primarily wavelengths
that you could see with your eye.

78
00:04:51,114 --> 00:04:54,840
Another big difference is 
that the Hubble Telescope is serviceable.

79
00:04:54,841 --> 00:05:00,581
We've sent astronauts five times to 
visit it, to upgrade it, and improve it,

80
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:03,121
and replace the old instruments,
and the old batteries,

81
00:05:03,122 --> 00:05:04,746
and the old solar arrays,

82
00:05:04,747 --> 00:05:08,124
and other kinds of things
that needed repair.

83
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:11,580
The Webb Telescope is planned to be
much farther away.

84
00:05:11,581 --> 00:05:17,083
It's going to be a million miles,
1.5 million kilometers away from Earth

85
00:05:17,084 --> 00:05:21,688
orbiting a place called 
the Sun-Earth Lagrange point 2.

86
00:05:21,689 --> 00:05:23,373
That's much too far away for us

87
00:05:23,374 --> 00:05:26,654
to be able to reach the observatory
with today's equipment.

88
00:05:26,655 --> 00:05:29,425
But of course,
in the very long term future,

89
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:30,800
it will be possible

90
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:37,675
for either robots or people
to be able to visit it if necessary.

91
00:05:38,957 --> 00:05:43,927
It is not planned for being repaired,
but it's not impossible to go there.

92
00:05:48,467 --> 00:05:51,832
Telescope was immediately seen 
to be extremely challenging

93
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:53,559
when we said we would build it.

94
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,032
The most challenging part
was thought to be the mirror technology.

95
00:05:57,583 --> 00:05:59,413
Because the Webb Telescope,

96
00:06:00,084 --> 00:06:03,751
although it has seven times
the collecting area of the Hubble,

97
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:07,919
needs to be of much, much lighter weight,
much lower mass

98
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,792
so that it can be carried
by an available rocket

99
00:06:11,792 --> 00:06:13,796
way out to the distant orbit.

100
00:06:15,837 --> 00:06:19,530
The Hubble mass is about 11,000 kilograms.

101
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:23,305
The Webb Telescope mass
is about 6,000 kilograms,

102
00:06:23,926 --> 00:06:26,893
just a little over half
what the Hubble is.

103
00:06:27,926 --> 00:06:31,247
The first challenge was to make mirrors
that would be good enough

104
00:06:32,172 --> 00:06:37,734
just as precise as necessary,
but of much, much lighter weight.

105
00:06:37,734 --> 00:06:41,773
The technology that we ended up 
choosing was beryllium,

106
00:06:41,774 --> 00:06:44,496
mirrors made out 
of solid beryllium and polished,

107
00:06:44,497 --> 00:06:49,014
so that they would have the right shape
when they're very cold.

108
00:06:49,015 --> 00:06:52,109
We also had to make them 
extremely thin and lightweight,

109
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:56,463
so each one is made
from a single block of beryllium

110
00:06:56,464 --> 00:06:59,082
that's been carved by machine tools

111
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:03,584
until we send about 95%
of the material back to the factory.

112
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:08,607
The mirrors are coated with gold,
a very, very thin layer of gold

113
00:07:08,608 --> 00:07:11,062
because that's 
the best infrared reflector.

114
00:07:11,483 --> 00:07:13,802
Another new technology that we required

115
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:19,022
is that the telescope is much larger
than the rocket vehicle that carries it.

116
00:07:19,463 --> 00:07:23,929
It means even the great collecting mirror
must be made out of pieces

117
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:27,795
that are unfolded
and then focused after launch.

118
00:07:28,343 --> 00:07:33,400
We have to develop the technology
to deploy the telescope itself

119
00:07:34,181 --> 00:07:36,867
and also to refocus it after launch.

120
00:07:37,338 --> 00:07:39,734
Of course, we had unexpected practice

121
00:07:39,735 --> 00:07:42,107
learning how to focus 
the telescope in space.

122
00:07:42,108 --> 00:07:45,171
When the Hubble Space Telescope
was launched out of focus,

123
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:47,075
we had to learn what to do.

124
00:07:47,076 --> 00:07:48,989
As it happens, the mathematics,

125
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:51,975
the algorithms that were developed
for repairing the Hubble

126
00:07:51,976 --> 00:07:54,988
are exactly the same ones 
that we're using to make sure

127
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:57,715
the Webb telescope 
is in focus after launch.

128
00:07:58,749 --> 00:08:01,027
Another new technology
that we required

129
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:03,167
is the deployable sunshield.

130
00:08:03,748 --> 00:08:07,715
The Hubble Space Telescope
is shaped like a tube,

131
00:08:07,716 --> 00:08:11,114
with the mirrors are protected inside.

132
00:08:11,115 --> 00:08:13,789
The Webb Telescope
is completely different in shape.

133
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:15,768
We have a much larger telescope

134
00:08:15,769 --> 00:08:18,393
that cannot possibly be 
surrounded by a tube.

135
00:08:18,394 --> 00:08:23,747
Also, we want it open to outer space
so that it can cool itself

136
00:08:23,748 --> 00:08:26,662
by radiating its only heat away
to outer space.

137
00:08:26,821 --> 00:08:30,780
That means the telescope is unprotected
except from one side

138
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:34,236
where we put something
we call a sunshield,

139
00:08:34,236 --> 00:08:39,958
basically a very large umbrella made out
of five layers of thin metalized plastic.

140
00:08:40,717 --> 00:08:45,924
This sunshield has to be folded up
for launch then unfolded after launch.

141
00:08:46,373 --> 00:08:52,235
It's a very complex unfolding process
that had never been required before.

142
00:08:52,236 --> 00:08:56,841
By the way, the size 
of this giant sunshield or umbrella

143
00:08:56,842 --> 00:09:00,278
is approximately the size
of a single tennis court.

144
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:02,923
Just imagine 
some of our famous tennis players

145
00:09:02,923 --> 00:09:05,737
running back and forth
over half of our sunshield.

146
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:10,088
Another technology we required
is improved infrared detectors.

147
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:14,082
These detectors use
a slightly different technology

148
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,304
from what we have in our cell phones
and pocket cameras.

149
00:09:17,305 --> 00:09:20,675
We need to be able to detect
infrared light.

150
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:27,333
The short wavelength bend that we covered
is from 0.6 to 5 microns wavelength.

151
00:09:27,334 --> 00:09:31,501
And for those detectors,
we have a mercury cadmium telluride alloy

152
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:37,528
connected up 
to a remarkable set of amplifiers.

153
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:42,580
This is a relatively new type
of technology.

154
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:44,958
What we had to do is perfect it,

155
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:49,998
so that very, very, rarely,
we'd we receive a false signal.

156
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:52,499
Infrared detectors quite often--

157
00:09:54,018 --> 00:09:57,279
The purpose of an infrared detector 
is to convert incoming light

158
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,743
into electrons that can be collected.

159
00:09:59,743 --> 00:10:02,103
A measure of quality is

160
00:10:02,103 --> 00:10:06,533
that almost all of the photons 
that come in and produce electrons,

161
00:10:06,533 --> 00:10:09,642
and also, nothing else produces electrons,

162
00:10:09,643 --> 00:10:13,647
so there's nothing happening
when the detectors are seeing nothing.

163
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:18,614
We have that kind of detector also,
a second kind

164
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:22,853
that works at the longer wavelength range
from 5 to 28 microns,

165
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:26,144
that's silicon doped with arsenic.

166
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:29,472
Those detectors
are also miraculously more sensitive

167
00:10:29,473 --> 00:10:31,306
than anything we ever had before.

168
00:10:32,097 --> 00:10:34,094
We had to make a cooler.

169
00:10:34,095 --> 00:10:38,562
This silicon doped with arsenic detector
must run at 6 Kelvin.

170
00:10:38,563 --> 00:10:44,939
We had to perfect a cooler to keep it cold
for the life of the mission.

171
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,350
Initially, we thought we would use
a solid block of hydrogen

172
00:10:48,351 --> 00:10:50,415
protected very carefully.

173
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,850
But we concluded
that it weighed too much,

174
00:10:52,851 --> 00:10:55,383
and it wouldn't have long enough lifetime.

175
00:10:55,384 --> 00:10:59,787
That meant that we had to develop
an active cooler similar in principle

176
00:10:59,788 --> 00:11:03,239
than what we have in every kitchen
by using helium gas

177
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:05,964
expanding at the lowest temperature,

178
00:11:05,964 --> 00:11:09,604
to produce the cooling that we need.

179
00:11:10,834 --> 00:11:14,126
Another interesting technology
is called an ASIC,

180
00:11:14,127 --> 00:11:17,119
Application-Specific Integrated Circuit.

181
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:22,733
We thought we needed these to be able 
to amplify the signals from our detectors

182
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:27,505
and prepare them for sending 
the long distance through long cables

183
00:11:27,505 --> 00:11:29,273
up to the warm electronics.

184
00:11:29,784 --> 00:11:33,189
So we made a new kind of ASIC
especially for that,

185
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,909
a combination of amplifiers
and computer technology

186
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,910
that can run very well
at a temperature of 40 degrees Kelvin.

187
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:44,809
All of these technologies were enumerated
at the beginning of the mission.

188
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:48,491
In order to get them, we held competitions

189
00:11:48,492 --> 00:11:53,308
and asked industrial companies
to propose how they would do them.

190
00:11:53,309 --> 00:11:56,443
In the end, we were able
to achieve them all

191
00:11:56,444 --> 00:12:02,149
by asking for industrial help
rather than by, for instance,

192
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:04,748
developing them inside NASA laboratories.

193
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:14,549
The Webb Telescope
has to be designed for a long life.

194
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:16,949
The longer, the better.

195
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,586
As it happens, the place
that we put the observatory

196
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:23,190
is an unstable orbit.

197
00:12:24,151 --> 00:12:27,898
We occasionally have to spend
some fuel

198
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,127
to keep the observatory
from falling off the orbit.

199
00:12:31,878 --> 00:12:35,070
That's the requirement to do that.

200
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:40,351
Also, some fuel is required
to deal with the torque

201
00:12:40,352 --> 00:12:44,778
that the solar photons,
the solar radiation produces

202
00:12:44,778 --> 00:12:46,987
pressing on the giant sunshield.

203
00:12:47,588 --> 00:12:51,991
If the center of pressure of the light
hitting the telescope

204
00:12:51,992 --> 00:12:55,124
is not near the center of mass,
then a torque is produced.

205
00:12:55,815 --> 00:13:00,130
Eventually, that has to be compensated
by firing little jets.

206
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:03,689
That's the number one thing.

207
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,907
We have to carry enough fuel
to last till the end of the mission.

208
00:13:06,908 --> 00:13:10,720
When we are very nearly done
with the observatory's operations

209
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:13,251
and have only a few ounces of fuel left,

210
00:13:13,252 --> 00:13:15,211
we need to use a little bit of that fuel

211
00:13:15,212 --> 00:13:18,501
to make sure that the observatory
is disposed off safely

212
00:13:18,502 --> 00:13:21,837
and send off to interplanetary orbit

213
00:13:21,838 --> 00:13:25,085
so that it does not come back
to hit the Earth.

214
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:33,283
The cooling system and everything else
on the observatory

215
00:13:33,284 --> 00:13:34,802
are powered electrically.

216
00:13:35,283 --> 00:13:40,460
They use solar panels, of course,
to get the electricity,

217
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:43,908
and so they could effectively run forever.

218
00:13:43,909 --> 00:13:48,189
There's no limitation on life
due to the cooling system.

219
00:13:49,190 --> 00:13:53,720
If we had followed their original idea
to use a solid block of hydrogen,

220
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:57,559
then it would have limited the life
of the instrument that it cooled.

221
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:03,785
Observations will be chosen

222
00:14:03,785 --> 00:14:07,616
as we do for the Hubble Space Telescope
and most of the observatories.

223
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,377
Astronomers who have an idea
will send proposals

224
00:14:12,378 --> 00:14:14,242
to be reviewed by a committee.

225
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:19,617
We anticipate probably
1,000 proposals per year

226
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:23,221
because that's about what we get
with the Hubble Space Telescope.

227
00:14:23,222 --> 00:14:25,881
Committee will meet
and make a recommendation.

228
00:14:25,882 --> 00:14:28,254
Eventually, a choice will be made.

229
00:14:29,225 --> 00:14:33,776
By the way, we have committed
because of our international partnership

230
00:14:33,777 --> 00:14:38,001
that a certain fraction of the proposals
that are selected

231
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,696
will be for European
and Canadian astronomers,

232
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:44,397
not just for the American proposers.

233
00:14:49,033 --> 00:14:53,682
We will be soliciting proposals
beginning about a year from now

234
00:14:53,683 --> 00:15:00,217
in February, 2017, for something we call
<i>Early Released Science.</i>

235
00:15:00,636 --> 00:15:05,071
Then proposals will be due 
about a year before launch

236
00:15:05,612 --> 00:15:09,499
for the major observing programs.

237
00:15:10,096 --> 00:15:14,625
Then they will have time to prepare--

238
00:15:14,626 --> 00:15:17,115
to make our decision
about what will we observed

239
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:21,065
and then prepare the detailed commands
for the observatory

240
00:15:21,066 --> 00:15:24,018
and make sure 
that that works properly the first time.

241
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:27,897
That's how we decide.

242
00:15:32,421 --> 00:15:34,213
We will have some time reserved

243
00:15:34,214 --> 00:15:37,053
for the Director
of the Space Telescope Science Institute.

244
00:15:37,054 --> 00:15:41,106
It will be allocated by him
or her as needed.

245
00:15:41,125 --> 00:15:47,500
Some of that is available for observations
that we call Targets of Opportunity.

246
00:15:47,709 --> 00:15:52,249
If you say, "I just saw,"--
as we did with Hubble--

247
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,876
that a comet 
is about to fall into Jupiter.

248
00:15:54,876 --> 00:15:56,335
Can we plan to observe that?"

249
00:15:56,336 --> 00:16:00,793
then of course, the Director
of the Observatory will be able to say,

250
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:03,003
"Yes. That's what I think we should do."

251
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:06,459
If somebody says,
"I saw a gamma ray burst,"

252
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:11,191
or, "I think a gravitational wave
was detected over there.

253
00:16:11,209 --> 00:16:12,751
We should look over there,"

254
00:16:12,753 --> 00:16:16,571
then the plan is to send 
the request to the Director.

255
00:16:16,572 --> 00:16:20,054
Within a couple days,
we should be able to observe that object.

256
00:16:23,334 --> 00:16:27,200
We will operate it by sending 
our radio commands every day.

257
00:16:27,209 --> 00:16:30,228
It has a command memory on-board.

258
00:16:30,229 --> 00:16:34,970
It actually is a little bit different
from the way that we operate the Hubble.

259
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,611
The Hubble is commanded

260
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:40,517
so that everything runs
according to a clock.

261
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:46,709
Each observation is scheduled
exactly down to the second.

262
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:50,230
The Webb Telescope is going to be operated
a little differently.

263
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:54,419
We will send a list of targets
that we want the Observatory to observe.

264
00:16:54,812 --> 00:16:58,137
Then it will go from target to target
as fast as it can.

265
00:16:58,781 --> 00:17:03,321
The idea is this will be more efficient
than the way that we do it with Hubble.

266
00:17:04,501 --> 00:17:05,922
Of course, there's another reason

267
00:17:05,922 --> 00:17:08,003
that the Observatory should be
more efficient,

268
00:17:08,003 --> 00:17:11,439
which is that we are not operating
near to the Earth.

269
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:15,063
The Hubble can't see
every part of the sky all the time

270
00:17:15,064 --> 00:17:17,906
because it rapidly orbits
around the Earth.

271
00:17:17,907 --> 00:17:19,579
And the Earth is so large.

272
00:17:22,999 --> 00:17:26,813
That's why we choose to do it
the other way in the Webb Telescope.

273
00:17:26,813 --> 00:17:32,716
We have planned for two contacts a day
via the Deep Space Network

274
00:17:32,716 --> 00:17:34,789
to send the data back and forth,

275
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:39,049
so that we can have opportunity to hear

276
00:17:39,049 --> 00:17:42,606
whether the Observatory is doing well,
if it needs any help.

277
00:17:42,607 --> 00:17:48,000
And so, those are the major differences
from the Hubble Space Telescope.

278
00:17:52,228 --> 00:17:55,283
I should say that, at the moment,
we are preparing our telescope.

279
00:17:55,284 --> 00:17:59,882
We have just completed attaching
all of the 18 mirror segments

280
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:02,998
of the primary mirror
to the carbon-fiber structure

281
00:18:02,999 --> 00:18:04,540
that will carry them.

282
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,414
We have just completed testing
our instrument package

283
00:18:07,415 --> 00:18:10,454
which includes four instruments,
by the way.

284
00:18:11,189 --> 00:18:15,374
We tested it now for the third time,
and we're very happy with it.

285
00:18:15,374 --> 00:18:18,310
At the end of this year,
at the end of 2016,

286
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:21,125
we will take the observatory to Texas,

287
00:18:21,126 --> 00:18:24,063
where there is even larger vacuum tank.

288
00:18:24,064 --> 00:18:28,296
We will test the entire telescope cold
in the giant vacuum tank there.

289
00:18:28,297 --> 00:18:32,574
By the way, it's the same vacuum tank
that was used by the Apollo astronauts

290
00:18:32,574 --> 00:18:37,412
to prepare themselves
to get out of their capsule

291
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:39,121
onto the surface of the Moon.

292
00:18:39,121 --> 00:18:42,007
It's a very, very old vacuum tank,
but it still works.

293
00:18:42,409 --> 00:18:46,222
From Texas, after it's completed
its testing there,

294
00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:48,118
we will ship it to California,

295
00:18:48,119 --> 00:18:53,405
where it will be combined
with the spacecraft bus.

296
00:18:54,036 --> 00:18:58,378
That is to say all of the electronics,
and the rocket engines,

297
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:03,726
and the power supplies,
and also, the unfolding sunshield,

298
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:06,103
the great umbrella that will protect it.

299
00:19:06,104 --> 00:19:08,693
After it's all tested
and proved out in California,

300
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:11,359
then we will ship it to French Guiana

301
00:19:11,359 --> 00:19:16,043
where the European launched ideas
for the Ariane rocket.

302
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:19,618
Europeans are buying the rocket
from Arianespace.

303
00:19:19,619 --> 00:19:24,111
We're very happy with that rocket,
it is a commercial success,

304
00:19:24,112 --> 00:19:28,977
and has had already over 
60 consecutive good launches.

305
00:19:28,977 --> 00:19:31,227
It's an excellent rocket for us to use.

306
00:19:31,227 --> 00:19:33,815
It's just the right size 
for the telescope.

307
00:19:45,876 --> 00:19:51,201
The Cosmic Background Explorer,
or COBE Satellite, was designed to measure

308
00:19:51,201 --> 00:19:54,016
the cosmic microwave background radiation

309
00:19:54,017 --> 00:19:56,284
and the cosmic infrared
background radiation

310
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:58,628
from the most distant universe.

311
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:05,566
It was conceived in 1974,
and finally launched by NASA in 1989,

312
00:20:05,567 --> 00:20:10,262
and immediately started taking data
and gave us some wonderful surprises.

313
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:13,758
There were three instruments on-board.

314
00:20:13,758 --> 00:20:19,790
One was an absolute spectrophotometer
for the far-infrared radiation

315
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:23,119
to measure whether the cosmic microwave
background radiation

316
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:28,459
has the predicted,
very precise black-body spectrum.

317
00:20:28,459 --> 00:20:31,126
A black-body spectrum is what we would get

318
00:20:31,126 --> 00:20:33,948
if the early universe
was extremely hot and dense

319
00:20:33,948 --> 00:20:35,973
and all in equilibrium.

320
00:20:37,117 --> 00:20:41,149
It's the simplest possible spectrum
that you could have.

321
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:45,958
Our measurement compared
the cosmic microwave radiation

322
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:48,959
with a black-body that we carried with us.

323
00:20:48,969 --> 00:20:51,430
Within weeks, we were able to announce

324
00:20:51,431 --> 00:20:54,840
that yes, indeed, the cosmos
has the predicted spectrum,

325
00:20:54,841 --> 00:20:58,876
and the cosmic background radiation
must truly be the heat remnant

326
00:20:58,877 --> 00:21:00,849
of the early expanding universe.

327
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:04,116
That was a tremendously important thing
to demonstrate

328
00:21:04,117 --> 00:21:09,214
since there had been considerable doubt
about that measurement.

329
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:12,204
We, of course, have had
many bad measurements,

330
00:21:12,205 --> 00:21:14,236
wrong measurements that preceded that.

331
00:21:14,237 --> 00:21:18,514
So when we showed our spectrum
to the Astronomical Society,

332
00:21:18,515 --> 00:21:23,906
in January of 1990, we received
a standing ovation for that measurement.

333
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:28,819
The second major discovery
that we made was to discover

334
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:32,231
that the cosmic background radiation
has hot and cold spots.

335
00:21:32,692 --> 00:21:35,691
what we call in Greek, <i>anisotropy</i>,

336
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:38,140
which means
"not the same in every direction".

337
00:21:38,141 --> 00:21:42,925
These were completely unknown
when we proposed our mission.

338
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:45,190
By the time the mission was launched,

339
00:21:45,191 --> 00:21:48,880
people had many predictions,
and some of them were correct.

340
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:52,191
We now interpret
the hot and cold spots that we saw

341
00:21:52,192 --> 00:21:56,933
as the seeds of the structure
of the galaxies that we see today.

342
00:21:57,554 --> 00:22:02,328
Now, you see that the galaxies
are not randomly arranged across the sky

343
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:05,354
or are clustered together in huge groups,

344
00:22:05,355 --> 00:22:08,589
and that there are huge empty volumes
in between those groups.

345
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:13,286
This is the result of gravitation
operating on the original structure,

346
00:22:13,287 --> 00:22:14,917
the primordial universe.

347
00:22:15,318 --> 00:22:20,082
The Cosmic Background Explorer Satellite 
team discovered those spots.

348
00:22:20,577 --> 00:22:24,832
We were extremely pleased
when Stephen Hawking saw those maps,

349
00:22:24,833 --> 00:22:28,316
he said, "It was the most important
scientific discovery of the century,

350
00:22:28,317 --> 00:22:29,726
if not of all time."

351
00:22:31,108 --> 00:22:33,750
The third instrument 
that we carried was to measure

352
00:22:33,750 --> 00:22:35,519
the cosmic infrared background radiation.

353
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,640
It also gave us an interesting surprise.

354
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:42,230
It showed that the universe has produced
much more light than we knew about,

355
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:45,464
and as converted, about half of its light

356
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:49,073
from ordinary starlight into far infrared.

357
00:22:49,369 --> 00:22:53,928
Far infrared light is produced
by dust grains surrounding the stars

358
00:22:53,929 --> 00:22:57,371
and is observable only
with special equipment

359
00:22:57,372 --> 00:22:59,980
that can observe
those very long wavelengths.

360
00:23:00,579 --> 00:23:04,156
The full story 
of that cosmic infrared background light

361
00:23:04,157 --> 00:23:06,436
has not been worked out completely,

362
00:23:06,436 --> 00:23:09,673
but it's told us some things
that we did not know before.

363
00:23:13,309 --> 00:23:16,703
After the James Webb, I think, I see,

364
00:23:16,703 --> 00:23:20,931
we need to build a whole sequence
of great new observatories

365
00:23:20,931 --> 00:23:23,865
because there is so many things
that we do not understand.

366
00:23:24,543 --> 00:23:27,605
NASA has already decided what to do next.

367
00:23:27,605 --> 00:23:32,712
It's called the WFIRST,
the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope,

368
00:23:33,264 --> 00:23:37,383
which will cover most of the sky
with observations;

369
00:23:37,384 --> 00:23:40,063
a telescope which is about 
the size of Hubble,

370
00:23:40,063 --> 00:23:44,705
but instrumented with infrared detectors
and a huge camera,

371
00:23:44,706 --> 00:23:47,875
so it can cover much of the sky
instead of just tiny bits.

372
00:23:48,358 --> 00:23:49,961
We know that we're going to do that.

373
00:23:49,961 --> 00:23:52,520
I'm sure that it will show us
wonderful surprises,

374
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:55,456
and will help us understand
the cosmic dark matter

375
00:23:55,457 --> 00:23:59,305
and the cosmic dark energy
in ways that we've never known before.

376
00:23:59,305 --> 00:24:04,955
After that, I know my fellow astronomers
want to fly X-ray telescopes

377
00:24:04,959 --> 00:24:07,585
because you can't X-rays
from the ground,

378
00:24:07,586 --> 00:24:08,954
gamma ray telescopes,

379
00:24:08,955 --> 00:24:11,112
because you can't see them
from the ground either.

380
00:24:12,282 --> 00:24:17,120
There is a project in preparation
to search for gravitational waves

381
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:20,514
using space observatory; it's called LISA.

382
00:24:21,125 --> 00:24:23,769
The current plan is for the Europe
to lead that mission.

383
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:28,293
After all these things are done
or maybe concurrently with them,

384
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:32,594
telescopes even larger than the Webb
should be planned, I think.

385
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,351
If we build a big enough one
with the right kind of technology,

386
00:24:36,351 --> 00:24:40,876
we should be able to not only answer
every kind of astronomers' questions

387
00:24:40,877 --> 00:24:42,392
that we have today

388
00:24:42,392 --> 00:24:45,392
but to look for planets around other stars

389
00:24:45,392 --> 00:24:47,376
that could show the signs of life.

390
00:24:48,207 --> 00:24:50,397
If we could find a planet like Earth

391
00:24:50,397 --> 00:24:53,074
that has the same chemistry
as our atmosphere,

392
00:24:53,765 --> 00:24:56,440
we would have a good sign
that it could be alive.

393
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,192
What chemistry would that be?

394
00:24:58,192 --> 00:25:00,684
We would be looking for oxygen

395
00:25:00,684 --> 00:25:05,500
because it's a very reactive molecule
that would not be present here on Earth

396
00:25:05,501 --> 00:25:11,647
without the photosynthetic activity
of cyanobacteria, and algae, and plants.

397
00:25:13,034 --> 00:25:15,044
We would be looking
for the carbon dioxide,

398
00:25:15,045 --> 00:25:16,459
and water, and methane

399
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,867
that are also in common
and important for life here on Earth.

400
00:25:20,584 --> 00:25:24,584
I think it's not so far off
that we would be able to know

401
00:25:24,602 --> 00:25:27,859
whether there are 
entire other planets way out there

402
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:30,512
that are similar to Earth and are alive.

403
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:35,398
I think here, in our own Solar System,
there's a huge opportunity

404
00:25:35,398 --> 00:25:39,934
to discover life elsewhere
within the Solar System.

405
00:25:40,453 --> 00:25:44,589
We have Mars probes
that are being improved every year

406
00:25:44,589 --> 00:25:46,492
with better and better instrumentation.

407
00:25:46,873 --> 00:25:49,026
We have the possibility
of bringing home some rocks

408
00:25:49,026 --> 00:25:51,850
so that they can be 
better analyzed here on the ground.

409
00:25:52,321 --> 00:25:55,915
We know that there are oceans
covered with ice

410
00:25:56,566 --> 00:26:00,851
on several locations in the Solar System
including at least two moons of Jupiter,

411
00:26:01,562 --> 00:26:06,743
a possibility of a moon around Saturn

412
00:26:06,744 --> 00:26:09,246
that has water under the ice.

413
00:26:09,247 --> 00:26:14,470
There is even a liquid ocean of methane
on the surface of Saturn,

414
00:26:14,878 --> 00:26:19,252
oceans, and rivers, and rain 
of methane on Saturn.

415
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:23,039
If life is possible
in some completely different way,

416
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,273
then maybe that's a good place
to go looking.

417
00:26:25,853 --> 00:26:29,447
All of these things are great mysteries
that we could tackle with more equipment

418
00:26:29,447 --> 00:26:32,547
and I think we will do so
over the next coming decades.

419
00:26:40,151 --> 00:26:42,996
I think that I never really chose
to be a scientist.

420
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:45,221
I think I just was always interested
in science

421
00:26:45,222 --> 00:26:48,464
as far back as I can remember anything.

422
00:26:48,654 --> 00:26:51,793
I remember that when I was 
about eight years old

423
00:26:51,794 --> 00:26:54,685
that I was already hearing about science.

424
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:57,559
Galileo and Darwin were heroes of mine.

425
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:00,382
I remember going to the museums

426
00:27:00,382 --> 00:27:06,540
and seeing dinosaur bones, and volcanoes,
and stories about the sky,

427
00:27:07,521 --> 00:27:12,155
seeing a giant iron meteorite
in the Museum of New York in New York City

428
00:27:12,156 --> 00:27:13,908
that had fallen on the Earth.

429
00:27:15,459 --> 00:27:18,154
I was just extremely curious about
all of these.

430
00:27:18,155 --> 00:27:22,479
I had the opportunity
to learn a great deal from books

431
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:26,040
and from toys that my parents got for me.

432
00:27:26,041 --> 00:27:29,082
I cannot remember
not wanting to be a scientist.

433
00:27:30,216 --> 00:27:35,068
I was fortunate to be able to pursue
that opportunity through school.

434
00:27:35,649 --> 00:27:41,226
Then eventually, almost randomly,
I ended up working for NASA.

435
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:47,435
In my graduate school career,
by the way, I worked on an experiment

436
00:27:47,435 --> 00:27:51,582
that was going to measure
the cosmic microwave background spectrum,

437
00:27:51,583 --> 00:27:55,452
but it failed, so I got a job
working for NASA

438
00:27:55,453 --> 00:27:57,583
and thought I would study something else.

439
00:27:57,584 --> 00:27:59,228
I would become a radio astronomer.

440
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:03,052
However, shortly after I got to NASA,

441
00:28:03,053 --> 00:28:06,687
NASA asked for proposals
for new satellite missions.

442
00:28:07,198 --> 00:28:11,038
I said to my new boss,
"But my thesis project failed.

443
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,887
We should try it in outer space."

444
00:28:13,618 --> 00:28:16,924
He said, "We will call up our friends.
We will write a proposal."

445
00:28:16,925 --> 00:28:20,635
That became the Cosmic Background Explorer
or COBE Satellite.

446
00:28:21,425 --> 00:28:25,725
This is a demonstration
that failure is not permanent,

447
00:28:25,726 --> 00:28:30,263
and that sometimes,
a problem is just too difficult for today,

448
00:28:30,264 --> 00:28:31,989
but we'll try it again tomorrow.

449
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:35,801
After the Cosmic Background
Explorer Project was complete,

450
00:28:35,802 --> 00:28:38,125
I was thinking about what to do next.

451
00:28:38,126 --> 00:28:41,365
I was beginning to think about a telescope

452
00:28:41,366 --> 00:28:44,508
that could be launched
and unfolded in space.

453
00:28:44,899 --> 00:28:49,780
Then, when in 1995, I got a phone call
from NASA Headquarters that said

454
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:52,966
it was time to plan 
the successor for Hubble,

455
00:28:52,966 --> 00:28:55,345
I said, "Of course,
I want to work on that."

456
00:28:55,346 --> 00:29:01,017
I was immediately ready to go and start 
a completely new kind of science,
