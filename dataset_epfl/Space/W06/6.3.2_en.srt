00:00:04,083 --> 00:00:07,526
The Challenger accident in January 1986

2
00:00:07,527 --> 00:00:12,974
was a very tragic event
in the history of the Shuttle program.

3
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:17,213
It resulted in the loss of the crew
and the loss of the spaceship

4
00:00:17,214 --> 00:00:18,647
in the ascent to space.

5
00:00:19,617 --> 00:00:24,343
You see here the logo of the mission 51L,

6
00:00:24,344 --> 00:00:26,545
which is the 24th Shuttle mission.

7
00:00:26,546 --> 00:00:30,810
You have the NASA crew members
in the circle,

8
00:00:30,811 --> 00:00:33,884
and in the bottom, you have
two so called Payload Specialists:

9
00:00:33,885 --> 00:00:36,627
Christa McAuliffe,
who was the first teacher in space

10
00:00:36,653 --> 00:00:38,733
in the Teacher in Space program,

11
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:41,370
and Greg Jarvis--two Payload Specialists.

12
00:00:41,371 --> 00:00:45,827
It was very cold that morning,
morning of the 28th of January 1986,

13
00:00:45,828 --> 00:00:47,803
and you can see on the left-hand side

14
00:00:47,804 --> 00:00:50,803
the picture that was taken
on the launchpad,

15
00:00:50,804 --> 00:00:54,708
very early morning that day,

16
00:00:54,709 --> 00:00:58,511
and there was some hesitation to go,

17
00:00:58,512 --> 00:01:01,481
because we were somewhat
outside of the certification

18
00:01:01,482 --> 00:01:04,010
for the Space Shuttle to launch--

19
00:01:04,012 --> 00:01:07,003
the temperature was
below certification temperature.

20
00:01:07,623 --> 00:01:11,745
However the launch
was pursued and continued

21
00:01:11,746 --> 00:01:13,085
the launch countdown,

22
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:17,036
and you see
on the right-hand side the lift off,

23
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:21,086
time T-zero just after ignition
of the Solid Rocket Boosters,

24
00:01:21,087 --> 00:01:24,264
and you can see here

25
00:01:24,265 --> 00:01:28,224
a path of smoke coming out
of the right Solid Rocket Booster.

26
00:01:28,225 --> 00:01:30,251
Of course, it was not noted at that time.

27
00:01:30,252 --> 00:01:33,322
That was noted only afterwards
on this picture.

28
00:01:33,622 --> 00:01:35,838
The Shuttle continued on the first stage,

29
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:40,567
and 73 seconds after lift off
we have that tragic event--

30
00:01:40,568 --> 00:01:42,554
an explosion of the Space Shuttle,

31
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:45,334
and you see the two Solid Rocket Boosters
that come apart,

32
00:01:45,335 --> 00:01:49,516
and they fly independently
on top of the picture.

33
00:01:49,517 --> 00:01:53,737
Obviously there was an investigation
that was done shortly after the accident.

34
00:01:54,969 --> 00:01:56,979
I have to say that it was not a hesitation

35
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:58,799
about the continuation of the program,

36
00:01:58,919 --> 00:02:01,361
but NASA was resilient enough

37
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:03,581
to still decide to continue the program.

38
00:02:03,582 --> 00:02:05,931
There was an interruption
of two and a half years

39
00:02:05,932 --> 00:02:07,572
of the program itself.

40
00:02:09,689 --> 00:02:12,321
The Rogers Commission, the commission
that was in charge

41
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:14,881
of investigating this accident

42
00:02:16,506 --> 00:02:19,207
got as a result of this investigation

43
00:02:19,208 --> 00:02:21,804
that the cause of the accident was a plume

44
00:02:21,805 --> 00:02:27,740
that developed after lift off
from this field joint

45
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:29,518
of the right Solid Rocket Booster--

46
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:31,838
you saw the path of smoke at lift off,

47
00:02:31,839 --> 00:02:37,217
but the hot gases generated
in the Solid Rocket Booster

48
00:02:37,218 --> 00:02:39,368
leaked outside of that joint

49
00:02:39,369 --> 00:02:42,270
and at some point
the temperature was so high

50
00:02:42,271 --> 00:02:44,070
around the external tank

51
00:02:44,071 --> 00:02:47,771
that it caused destruction of the orbiter
73 seconds after lift off.

52
00:02:47,772 --> 00:02:52,472
So the cause of the accident
was a failure of the field joint

53
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:56,634
to contain the hot gases
inside the Solid Rocket Booster

54
00:02:56,635 --> 00:02:59,185
and destruction of the orbiter
resulting from that.

55
00:02:59,516 --> 00:03:05,298
Now, we talk about
Solid Rocket Booster field joints--

56
00:03:05,299 --> 00:03:08,487
you see several cylindrical joints
on the Solid Rocket Booster

57
00:03:08,488 --> 00:03:11,748
from the nozzle to the tip,

58
00:03:12,209 --> 00:03:17,459
and some factory joints
that were made at Morton Thiokol,

59
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,842
the manufacturer
of the Solid Rocket Booster,

60
00:03:20,843 --> 00:03:24,283
and the field joints,
we see three of them here,

61
00:03:24,927 --> 00:03:27,436
were made at Kennedy Space Center,

62
00:03:27,437 --> 00:03:29,830
the cylindrical parts
sent from Morton Thiokol

63
00:03:29,831 --> 00:03:34,519
were put together with the system
that was really flawed,

64
00:03:35,589 --> 00:03:41,249
and the Rogers Commission
clearly made the statement

65
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:46,454
that there was a flaw in the design
of the field joint

66
00:03:46,455 --> 00:03:48,314
of the Solid Rocket Boosters.

67
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:52,062
Now, let's look on the left-hand side
of the old design

68
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:54,402
of the field joints
of the Solid Rocket Booster.

69
00:03:54,403 --> 00:04:01,352
You have to imagine
one cylinder at the bottom

70
00:04:01,353 --> 00:04:03,170
and a cylinder on the top,

71
00:04:03,171 --> 00:04:06,871
and this is the field joint
that we are talking about.

72
00:04:09,062 --> 00:04:12,494
The section of the lowest cylinder
is in red on this joint,

73
00:04:12,495 --> 00:04:15,855
and the section
of the upper cylinder is in yellow,

74
00:04:17,046 --> 00:04:21,363
and the inside of the Solid
Rocket Booster is here,

75
00:04:21,365 --> 00:04:23,134
on the right-hand side,

76
00:04:23,135 --> 00:04:25,759
so this is where the hot gases
are generated,

77
00:04:26,739 --> 00:04:31,558
and obviously there is pressure
in this direction

78
00:04:31,559 --> 00:04:34,564
at the ignition
of the Solid Rocket Booster

79
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:36,288
during the whole combustion process,

80
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:38,564
and there is pressure
in the same direction

81
00:04:38,565 --> 00:04:40,304
in the bottom part.

82
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:44,385
And here you see in green the two O-rings

83
00:04:44,386 --> 00:04:48,586
that are supposed to cause a seal

84
00:04:48,587 --> 00:04:51,065
and prevent the hot gases from coming out.

85
00:04:51,066 --> 00:04:55,618
And obviously if you have
the yellow segment on the top

86
00:04:55,619 --> 00:04:59,863
moving to the left

87
00:04:59,864 --> 00:05:02,748
and the red portion in the bottom
moving to the left also,

88
00:05:02,749 --> 00:05:06,546
you are going to have a small gap
that will be formed

89
00:05:06,547 --> 00:05:07,946
in this area here,

90
00:05:07,947 --> 00:05:12,846
and the O-rings may not be able
to contain the hot gases

91
00:05:12,847 --> 00:05:15,318
and prevent them from coming out.

92
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,079
Now, as it was very cold that day

93
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,502
the O-rings did not have the resilience

94
00:05:20,503 --> 00:05:23,608
and capability to prevent
the hot gases from coming out.

95
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:27,717
So really the cause of the accident
was, on one hand,

96
00:05:27,727 --> 00:05:31,705
the faulty design, this field joint,

97
00:05:31,706 --> 00:05:33,166
as indicated here,

98
00:05:33,169 --> 00:05:36,147
and also the low temperature
that prevented the O-ring

99
00:05:36,148 --> 00:05:39,181
from performing the expected task.

100
00:05:39,182 --> 00:05:42,620
If you look on the right-hand side,

101
00:05:42,621 --> 00:05:43,816
you have the fix

102
00:05:43,817 --> 00:05:46,415
that was implemented.

103
00:05:46,416 --> 00:05:49,289
This is following recommendations
of the Rogers Commission.

104
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:51,476
You see here so called "capture feature"

105
00:05:51,477 --> 00:05:53,006
that prevented the separation

106
00:05:53,007 --> 00:05:55,802
between the red part
and the yellow part

107
00:05:55,803 --> 00:05:57,542
with the O-rings here.

108
00:05:57,543 --> 00:05:59,907
There was another O-ring
that was added here,

109
00:05:59,908 --> 00:06:03,707
and in addition,
there was a heater system

110
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:07,606
that was added to maintain
a relatively high temperature

111
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:11,707
in the area of every field joint
of the Solid Rocket Booster.

112
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:13,858
So this is the main cause of the accident

113
00:06:13,859 --> 00:06:16,691
and of course there were
other contributing factors.

114
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:18,612
The pressure at launch was on of them.

115
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:21,040
At that time the Shuttle
was going to be used

116
00:06:21,041 --> 00:06:23,240
not only for science and exploration,

117
00:06:23,241 --> 00:06:26,501
but also for commercial missions
or for the Department of Defense,

118
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,829
and after the Challenger accident,
it was decided

119
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:33,552
to only use the Shuttle for research
and development, and science,

120
00:06:33,553 --> 00:06:35,911
and not for commercial missions

121
00:06:35,912 --> 00:06:37,942
or Department of Defense missions.

122
00:06:38,682 --> 00:06:41,831
Also other improvements
were brought together,

123
00:06:41,832 --> 00:06:43,701
like the use 
of the Launch and Entry Suit,

124
00:06:43,702 --> 00:06:46,537
which was not used before,

125
00:06:46,538 --> 00:06:47,928
in order to protect the crew

126
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:50,638
against possible failures
during the ascent,

127
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,349
like a loss of cabin pressure.

128
00:06:55,539 --> 00:06:57,139
NASA took advantage

129
00:06:57,139 --> 00:06:59,648
on the basis of the recommendations
of the Rogers Commission

130
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:02,468
to improve the safety of the Space Shuttle

131
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:06,461
and, in general, to improve
the safety culture of the organization.
