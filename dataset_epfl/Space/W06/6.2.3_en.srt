1
00:00:04,324 --> 00:00:06,981
This is a general cutaway
of the Space Shuttle.

2
00:00:06,981 --> 00:00:09,432
This is the habitable compartment,

3
00:00:09,432 --> 00:00:13,446
the forward portion
with the flight deck, and the mid-deck,

4
00:00:13,446 --> 00:00:15,776
and we'll detail these later.

5
00:00:15,776 --> 00:00:18,566
Now, we see the rest of the Orbiter
with the payload bay;

6
00:00:18,566 --> 00:00:20,604
the payload bay doors open.

7
00:00:20,604 --> 00:00:25,877
The afts you have the parts containing
the fuel for the reaction control system,

8
00:00:25,877 --> 00:00:27,658
the orbiter maneuvering system.

9
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:30,479
You see that the wing in this cutaway

10
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:34,833
is a pretty standard,
aeronautical structure

11
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:37,945
in aluminium of course, covered with
thermal protection tiles,

12
00:00:37,945 --> 00:00:42,461
but inside is pretty much
a classical, aeronautical construction.

13
00:00:42,461 --> 00:00:46,841
Here you have some details
of the standard habitable compartments

14
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:51,176
with the flight deck,
the mid deck, and the airlock.

15
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:54,858
And there was a floor on the flight deck

16
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:56,373
which you see here,

17
00:00:56,373 --> 00:00:59,422
and there was access
from the flight deck to the mid deck

18
00:00:59,422 --> 00:01:02,281
or mid deck to flight deck
through square holes

19
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:06,102
that were in the back of the commander's
and the pilot's seats.

20
00:01:06,102 --> 00:01:09,130
The lower deck wasn't habitable.

21
00:01:09,130 --> 00:01:12,928
There was an access to it to change
the LOH cartridges

22
00:01:12,928 --> 00:01:15,032
for the removal of the carbon dioxide

23
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:16,807
but it wasn't really a habitable area

24
00:01:16,807 --> 00:01:20,219
so we had a flight deck, a mid deck,
and an airlock that were habitable.

25
00:01:20,219 --> 00:01:23,489
That's a nice overall view
of the flight deck.

26
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:27,721
You have the seats for the commander
and the pilot here,

27
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:31,313
the instrument panel in the front,

28
00:01:31,313 --> 00:01:34,557
and I was mentioning
the holes giving access

29
00:01:34,557 --> 00:01:36,733
to the mid deck for the flight deck

30
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:40,690
there is one here, there was another one
behind the pilot seats.

31
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:43,091
Of interest are also the windows,

32
00:01:43,091 --> 00:01:46,410
obviously, you have the front windows
pretty much like in an airliner,

33
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,460
but you had overhead windows,

34
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:51,389
two pretty large overhead windows,
square in shape,

35
00:01:51,389 --> 00:01:53,658
on top of the aft flight deck.

36
00:01:53,658 --> 00:01:56,414
And you had these aft windows,

37
00:01:56,414 --> 00:01:58,964
allowing the crew to see
what was happening,

38
00:01:58,964 --> 00:02:01,094
in the payload bay
there were two of them.

39
00:02:01,596 --> 00:02:04,813
A nicer night view
of the forward flight deck

40
00:02:04,813 --> 00:02:07,702
and this is the configuration
of the instrument panel

41
00:02:07,702 --> 00:02:09,935
after the modification that was done

42
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:13,836
about in the year 2000 for all four
Space Shuttle Orbiters.

43
00:02:13,836 --> 00:02:18,680
The instrument panel was modified
to a glass cockpit-type,

44
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,097
pretty much like the modern airliners
at the time.

45
00:02:22,097 --> 00:02:24,733
This is a view of the mid deck,

46
00:02:24,733 --> 00:02:27,533
it's kind of bare view of the mid deck.

47
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:29,380
It doesn't have a lot of equipment.

48
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:31,326
Of course, you see the seat here,

49
00:02:31,326 --> 00:02:34,231
but it was only there
for the ascent to space

50
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:35,878
for up to three crew members.

51
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:39,415
You had four in the flight deck,
and up to three in the mid deck

52
00:02:39,415 --> 00:02:42,208
for up to seven crew members.

53
00:02:42,208 --> 00:02:46,622
In the forward part of the mid deck,
you had lockers, crew lockers,

54
00:02:46,622 --> 00:02:51,066
where the food, with the tools, 
clothing and so on,

55
00:02:51,066 --> 00:02:54,269
all of the equipment
was basically in these lockers.

56
00:02:54,269 --> 00:02:58,181
Also, some lockers
in the rear part of the mid deck.

57
00:02:58,181 --> 00:03:01,595
Now, on the port side of the mid deck
which you see here,

58
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:03,733
you have the food preparation station

59
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:05,882
and from where this picture was taken,

60
00:03:05,882 --> 00:03:08,417
pretty much was 
the waste collection system

61
00:03:08,417 --> 00:03:10,017
that I'll talk about afterwards.

62
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:11,266
But you see a ladder here,

63
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:14,383
allowing access from the mid deck
to the flight deck,

64
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:18,208
but this if for the simulator
on the ground.

65
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,666
In gravity, you have to use the ladder

66
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:24,872
it's basically just for moving yourself
from a compartment to the other one,

67
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,914
without using the ladder, obviously.

68
00:03:26,914 --> 00:03:28,812
Food preparation on the Shuttle:

69
00:03:28,812 --> 00:03:31,571
basically the food was taken
in dehydrated form,

70
00:03:31,571 --> 00:03:36,411
and food preparation in the kitchen,
in a way, was a re-hydration station

71
00:03:36,411 --> 00:03:38,040
which you have here.

72
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:43,994
You could select injection
of a certain volume of water,

73
00:03:43,994 --> 00:03:46,020
either hot water or cold water,

74
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:48,046
depending on whether you wanted to make

75
00:03:48,046 --> 00:03:50,633
Beef Stroganoff or orange juice,

76
00:03:50,633 --> 00:03:53,347
and there was a heater at the bottom here

77
00:03:53,347 --> 00:03:55,295
so you can re-heat the food,

78
00:03:55,295 --> 00:03:57,510
and this is basically the kitchen.

79
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:01,737
The food was all prepared and cooked
in the kitchen in Houston

80
00:04:01,737 --> 00:04:04,695
and taken on board, mainly
in a dehydrated form.

81
00:04:04,695 --> 00:04:07,093
Waste collection system:
you had to have one,

82
00:04:07,093 --> 00:04:09,957
and is basically a commode,

83
00:04:09,957 --> 00:04:12,805
pretty much like a commode
of waste collection system,

84
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:16,705
or a bathroom, or toilet,
here on surface of planet Earth.

85
00:04:16,705 --> 00:04:20,512
Here you have two handles
that you had to lift

86
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:22,891
and then raise,
and then put on your thighs

87
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:27,351
so that you would stay on the commode
during the operation.

88
00:04:27,351 --> 00:04:30,639
And you you had to follow very strictly
the procedure which was here,

89
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,337
on your right-hand side,

90
00:04:32,337 --> 00:04:36,081
in order to do the proper sequencing
of the opening and closing of the valves;

91
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:37,947
you had to be very rigorous about that.

92
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:39,268
But it worked fine.

93
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:40,916
This is the Shuttle airlock,

94
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,770
obviously another habitable area,

95
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,990
although it was inhabited
only a short time

96
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,688
when there was space walking

97
00:04:46,688 --> 00:04:49,023
in order to go out and come back in.

98
00:04:49,023 --> 00:04:53,383
Obviously, the airlock, can be
either under normal cabin pressure

99
00:04:53,383 --> 00:04:57,432
or after closing the inner door
of the airlock,

100
00:04:57,432 --> 00:05:01,145
you can evacuate it,
when it's completely under vacuum

101
00:05:01,145 --> 00:05:02,949
you can open the outer door

102
00:05:02,949 --> 00:05:05,025
and start your space walk,

103
00:05:05,025 --> 00:05:07,627
after, of course, attaching
your safety tether.

104
00:05:07,627 --> 00:05:11,582
On the right hand side you see
a view of the airlock

105
00:05:11,582 --> 00:05:13,587
pretty much from the outer hatch

106
00:05:13,587 --> 00:05:15,098
--this is the inner hatch--

107
00:05:15,098 --> 00:05:17,297
giving access to the mid deck.

108
00:05:17,297 --> 00:05:19,718
You can see the lockers
in the background here.

109
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:22,370
You have two stations here,

110
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:25,211
allowing for the two space suits

111
00:05:25,211 --> 00:05:28,061
that were located, one was here,
the other one, there.

112
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:33,156
From this control system,
you could change the pressure

113
00:05:33,156 --> 00:05:34,719
in the airlock evacuated

114
00:05:34,719 --> 00:05:38,819
and do some other adjustments
in the airlock.

115
00:05:38,819 --> 00:05:41,579
On the left hand side,
you have two crew members

116
00:05:41,579 --> 00:05:44,667
that have taken place in this airlock

117
00:05:44,667 --> 00:05:46,405
after donning the spacesuits.

118
00:05:46,405 --> 00:05:47,956
You see that it's quite small,

119
00:05:47,956 --> 00:05:53,566
and you see that during
the preparation of the airlock

120
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:57,566
we have an umbilical 
attached to the space suit

121
00:05:57,566 --> 00:06:00,306
that was providing oxygen on one hand

122
00:06:00,306 --> 00:06:02,286
and electrical power to the space suits,

123
00:06:02,286 --> 00:06:05,316
although we would not use 
these resources while in the airlock;

124
00:06:05,316 --> 00:06:09,246
the umbilical was detached
prior to exiting the airlock.
