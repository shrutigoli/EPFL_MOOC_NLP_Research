1
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:06,875
On this video, we'll briefly describe

2
00:00:06,876 --> 00:00:09,541
a few selected missions
of the Space Shuttle.

3
00:00:10,127 --> 00:00:11,130
Just to illustrate

4
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:13,683
the extraordinary capability
of the spacecraft,

5
00:00:13,684 --> 00:00:18,197
and also the wide spectrum
of utilization of the Shuttle,

6
00:00:18,198 --> 00:00:20,050
which was used to deploy satellites,

7
00:00:20,051 --> 00:00:24,108
to bring back satellites,
broken satellites, to Earth,

8
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:28,084
to do space science using Spacelab mainly,

9
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:30,466
to do interventions
on satellites or telescope

10
00:00:30,467 --> 00:00:31,732
to do repair work,

11
00:00:32,281 --> 00:00:34,323
or to assemble large structures,

12
00:00:34,324 --> 00:00:37,011
which is the case
for the International Space Station.

13
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:43,015
Now, this is a nice picture
of Shuttle flight 11 or 41C.

14
00:00:43,647 --> 00:00:48,983
At that time, that was following
the tenth Shuttle mission,

15
00:00:48,984 --> 00:00:52,285
and NASA decided to use another code
for the Shuttle missions.

16
00:00:52,747 --> 00:00:56,847
41C. Here, the 4 is a fiscal year:

17
00:00:57,377 --> 00:00:58,496
1984.

18
00:00:58,497 --> 00:01:00,880
The 1 is for a launch
from Kennedy Space Center.

19
00:01:00,881 --> 00:01:02,085
The C is a sequence,

20
00:01:02,086 --> 00:01:06,445
so it is the third mission
from Kennedy Space Center

21
00:01:06,815 --> 00:01:09,987
in the fiscal year 1984.

22
00:01:11,496 --> 00:01:16,312
NASA used that code for a while,
and then after the Challenger accident 51L

23
00:01:17,152 --> 00:01:22,206
again they started to use
the normal sequence, the number sequence.

24
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:25,666
Anyway, that's a mission

25
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:27,677
that had as an objective
to do a rendezvous

26
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:29,616
with a Solar Max Mission Satellite

27
00:01:29,617 --> 00:01:33,683
that had a defective attitude
control system,

28
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:36,446
and the idea was to go spacewalking,

29
00:01:37,466 --> 00:01:41,931
and repair that attitude control system,
the spacecraft you see here,

30
00:01:42,828 --> 00:01:45,653
and astronauts in the so-called
Manned Maneuvering Unit,

31
00:01:45,654 --> 00:01:46,654
which was

32
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:49,330
a small spacecraft

33
00:01:49,331 --> 00:01:52,590
that was attached to the spacesuits

34
00:01:52,591 --> 00:01:55,221
while spacewalking
that allowed the astronauts

35
00:01:55,411 --> 00:01:57,442
to move around in translation rotation,

36
00:01:57,443 --> 00:01:59,766
and to get toward the satellites

37
00:01:59,767 --> 00:02:05,824
without being attached to the robot arm,
or without having even a safety tether,

38
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:07,865
and do the work on the satellite.

39
00:02:07,876 --> 00:02:11,197
It was a successful repair
of the SMM Satellite.

40
00:02:11,198 --> 00:02:14,668
Again, quite a demonstration
of the capability of the Space Shuttle;

41
00:02:14,669 --> 00:02:17,572
only from the Space Shuttle
could you do such a mission.

42
00:02:17,918 --> 00:02:21,293
Another example, this time it's STS-51A.

43
00:02:22,203 --> 00:02:25,518
The first mission of the fiscal year 1985.

44
00:02:25,714 --> 00:02:27,461
In November '84 in fact,

45
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,980
but the fiscal year '85 
had already started.

46
00:02:32,089 --> 00:02:35,247
Now, this is quite an interesting mission,
because on the one hand,

47
00:02:35,248 --> 00:02:38,501
the Shuttle deployed two satellites,
two communication satellites,

48
00:02:38,502 --> 00:02:41,457
pretty much like the one
that you see in the illustration.

49
00:02:43,522 --> 00:02:45,794
After the deployment
of these two satellites,

50
00:02:46,024 --> 00:02:48,761
it recovered 
two other communication satellites,

51
00:02:48,762 --> 00:02:51,613
put them in the payload bay,
and brought them back to Earth.

52
00:02:51,626 --> 00:02:56,043
And again, you see the involvement
of the Manned Maneuvering Unit here.

53
00:02:56,274 --> 00:02:58,923
So, the astronaut could get
to the satellite,

54
00:02:59,303 --> 00:03:02,708
get kind of a docking
to the rotating satellite,

55
00:03:02,709 --> 00:03:06,043
and use the attitude control system
of the Manned Maneuvering Unit

56
00:03:06,049 --> 00:03:10,869
to break the rotation before the satellite
was brought back to the payload bay,

57
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:12,641
and eventually brought back to Earth.

58
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:16,113
And another one followed after that,

59
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:18,135
quite a remarkable mission

60
00:03:18,136 --> 00:03:21,694
illustrating the incredible capability
of the Space Shuttle.

61
00:03:22,596 --> 00:03:26,286
I mentioned another important utilization
is for science,

62
00:03:26,286 --> 00:03:30,867
and mainly with European
developed and delivered Spacelab

63
00:03:30,868 --> 00:03:32,630
for the European Space Agency.

64
00:03:33,224 --> 00:03:34,920
Now, this is STS-9.

65
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:36,504
The Commander was John Young,

66
00:03:36,505 --> 00:03:40,126
who had flown as a Commander
of the first Shuttle flight STS-1,

67
00:03:40,996 --> 00:03:43,320
in April 1981.

68
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:47,229
Here, you see the Spacelab module

69
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:49,999
with, for the first time,

70
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,064
a European crew member
on board, Ulf Merbold,

71
00:03:52,064 --> 00:03:54,129
who was a payload specialist
of this flight.

72
00:03:54,548 --> 00:03:58,090
The idea was to use Spacelab for science,

73
00:03:58,091 --> 00:04:02,563
whether it was by US scientists
or by other nations,

74
00:04:02,564 --> 00:04:04,328
and as it was delivered by Europe,

75
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:07,145
the first flight of Spacelab
with a Spacelab module

76
00:04:07,146 --> 00:04:10,356
was going to be 
a joint European-US mission,

77
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:13,812
so you have a payload specialist
and a mission specialist

78
00:04:13,813 --> 00:04:15,882
inside the module performing experiments

79
00:04:15,883 --> 00:04:20,060
on this first flight of Spacelab
at the end of 1983.

80
00:04:20,896 --> 00:04:22,640
This is another configuration of Spacelab

81
00:04:22,641 --> 00:04:24,651
where we don't have
the pressurized module,

82
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:26,847
but we have pallets in the payload bay

83
00:04:27,286 --> 00:04:28,830
supporting instruments.

84
00:04:28,831 --> 00:04:31,906
This is Spacelab 2 flown in July 1985.

85
00:04:32,426 --> 00:04:35,909
The purpose of this mission
was to do astronomical observation

86
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:38,039
with an instrument
that were on the pallets,

87
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,445
but through the so-called
Instrument Pointing System

88
00:04:41,446 --> 00:04:43,755
that was providing a better accuracy

89
00:04:43,756 --> 00:04:47,776
of pointing at this scientific instrument
than the Shuttle was able to provide.

90
00:04:47,976 --> 00:04:50,140
By the way, that was 
an interesting mission,

91
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,789
because we had
the center engine failure ...

92
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,507
not failure, but it shut down
three and a half minutes after lift-off,

93
00:04:57,508 --> 00:05:01,899
and it was, in the whole Shuttle program
out of the 135 flights,

94
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,621
that was the only mission
on which we had a failure,

95
00:05:05,622 --> 00:05:07,631
respectively, a shut down of an engine.

96
00:05:08,371 --> 00:05:11,903
So the mission could not reach
the nominal altitude,

97
00:05:11,904 --> 00:05:15,790
but it came a little bit lower
than the planned altitude.

98
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:18,061
We still had two other engines

99
00:05:18,062 --> 00:05:20,782
providing thrust
for the rest of the ascent to orbit.

100
00:05:20,783 --> 00:05:26,413
So it was not a catastrophic event,
but still an interesting circumstance.

101
00:05:26,414 --> 00:05:30,409
By the way, it was not really
an engine shut down itself,

102
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,025
or an engine failure,

103
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:36,235
but it was rather the consequence
of temperature sensors

104
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,625
in the high-pressure fuel turbopump.

105
00:05:39,972 --> 00:05:43,556
There were two redundant sensors
that sensed too high a temperature,

106
00:05:43,557 --> 00:05:47,311
and caused the planned shut down
of the engine

107
00:05:47,311 --> 00:05:49,720
following this supposedly failure,

108
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,220
but it was not one,
it was a sensor failure

109
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,658
not an engine failure itself.

110
00:05:55,449 --> 00:05:59,092
Anyway, that's another configuration
of Spacelab for astronomy.

111
00:06:00,374 --> 00:06:02,511
Many more missions followed that one.

112
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:05,857
There's a grand total
of 22 Spacelab missions

113
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:09,689
that were flown from STS-9 in 1983

114
00:06:10,389 --> 00:06:16,918
until 1998, at that time, on one hand,
we had had Shuttle-Mir program,

115
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:21,368
and the assembly
of the International Space Station

116
00:06:21,369 --> 00:06:23,732
was starting in 1998,

117
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:26,174
so there was no reason
to operate Spacelab any more.

118
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:28,709
But still, it was not
an insignificant component

119
00:06:28,709 --> 00:06:31,652
of the Shuttle utilization.

120
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:34,246
Here, we see Neurolab,

121
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:39,965
it was a module-only mission
of Spacelab in 1998.

122
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:44,980
Now in the area 
of spacecraft deployment on orbit,

123
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,389
that I mentioned before,

124
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,639
we had, of course,
a very significant spacecraft

125
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:51,183
that was deployed in April 1990:

126
00:06:51,183 --> 00:06:52,772
the Hubble Space Telescope

127
00:06:52,772 --> 00:06:55,350
that, in fact, filled the whole cargo bay.

128
00:06:55,351 --> 00:07:00,434
You see the pre-launch configuration
in the cargo bay on the left-hand side.

129
00:07:01,414 --> 00:07:04,698
This is the forward portion
of the payload bay,

130
00:07:04,698 --> 00:07:06,005
and this is the aft,

131
00:07:06,006 --> 00:07:10,073
and you see the telescope
with a mass of about 13 metric tons

132
00:07:10,074 --> 00:07:11,869
was filling the whole payload bay.

133
00:07:12,089 --> 00:07:16,685
On the left-hand side, you see
the deployment on this mission STS-31

134
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,603
in the spring of 1990.

135
00:07:19,613 --> 00:07:21,634
The telescope had been grappled

136
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:24,369
on one of the grapple fixtures
that you see here

137
00:07:24,799 --> 00:07:28,309
with the robot arm
lifted out of the payload bay.

138
00:07:29,218 --> 00:07:32,856
A nice view from a camera
that was in the aft payload bay.

139
00:07:32,857 --> 00:07:36,701
You see the telescope
after deployment of the solar array.

140
00:07:36,702 --> 00:07:38,827
The solar arrays are oriented to the Sun.

141
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:42,522
And you see the robot arm
has just released the telescope.

142
00:07:42,523 --> 00:07:45,934
Now, both the Shuttle and the telescope

143
00:07:45,934 --> 00:07:49,260
are freeflying in formation

144
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:51,645
at this velocity
of 28,000 kilometers an hour,

145
00:07:51,646 --> 00:07:53,031
which is quite impressive,

146
00:07:53,031 --> 00:07:56,122
but, you know, the deployment
was done very softly,

147
00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:58,429
so both of the spacecraft
were really flying

148
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:00,431
in formation in parallel with each other.

149
00:08:02,019 --> 00:08:06,494
We'll talk about the servicing mission
of the Hubble Space Telescope

150
00:08:06,495 --> 00:08:09,794
on a later section of this course.

151
00:08:10,228 --> 00:08:13,791
Now the Shuttle-Mir program
between 1994 and 1998

152
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:15,751
was a result of a cooperation effort

153
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:18,210
between Roscosmos and NASA.

154
00:08:18,227 --> 00:08:23,479
The idea was really to do a preparation
before the assembly,

155
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:26,208
and then, a utilization
of the International Space Station

156
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:27,549
with all the other partners,

157
00:08:27,669 --> 00:08:32,037
but obviously the dominant partners
being Russia and the United States.

158
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,147
Mir was on orbit at that time,

159
00:08:34,148 --> 00:08:35,729
and the Shuttle was operational,

160
00:08:35,730 --> 00:08:40,626
so it was decided to do dockings
of the Shuttle with the Mir,

161
00:08:41,234 --> 00:08:45,565
and allow also American astronauts
to work in Mir

162
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,851
together with Russian cosmonauts,

163
00:08:47,852 --> 00:08:50,368
so it was quite an interesting
learning experience

164
00:08:50,369 --> 00:08:53,437
prior to the International
Space Station exercise.

165
00:08:53,438 --> 00:08:56,625
There was a total of nine dockings

166
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:59,738
to the Mir Space Station
with the Shuttle.

167
00:08:59,739 --> 00:09:03,646
Obviously, also the mating system
between the Shuttle and Mir

168
00:09:03,647 --> 00:09:06,231
had to be designed and engineered,

169
00:09:06,232 --> 00:09:11,941
so it was an exercise in cooperation
between these two nations on one hand.

170
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,947
It was a technical cooperation also,

171
00:09:13,948 --> 00:09:17,873
and from a human side,
it was also quite a valuable exercise.

172
00:09:18,538 --> 00:09:20,982
Assembly of the International
Space Station,

173
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:24,751
again the decision to go ahead with ISS

174
00:09:24,778 --> 00:09:27,598
had been made already in the early 90s

175
00:09:28,088 --> 00:09:31,311
together with the 15 nations total:

176
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:34,149
the United States, Russia, Canada, Japan

177
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,966
and members of the European Space Agency.

178
00:09:37,594 --> 00:09:39,787
The beginning of the assembly was

179
00:09:40,477 --> 00:09:41,871
at the end of the 90s,

180
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:43,553
and first of all, there was

181
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:46,709
the Zarya module

182
00:09:46,713 --> 00:09:49,213
that was launched with a Proton launcher

183
00:09:49,918 --> 00:09:52,915
from Baikonur in Kazakhstan.

184
00:09:52,915 --> 00:09:56,709
And then, the first arrival
of the American elements

185
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,575
was on Mission 88,

186
00:09:58,576 --> 00:10:01,997
and you see here on the left-hand side,

187
00:10:02,237 --> 00:10:05,435
the installation of Node 1,

188
00:10:05,945 --> 00:10:09,083
which was the first US element
of the Unity Node.

189
00:10:10,034 --> 00:10:13,871
On the forward portion
of the payload bay here,

190
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:17,777
it was mated there, and then,
you see on the right-hand side

191
00:10:17,778 --> 00:10:21,486
a capture with a robot arm
of the Zarya module.

192
00:10:21,893 --> 00:10:28,284
Then, there was a mating of the Zarya
with the upper docking port of the Node 1.

193
00:10:28,285 --> 00:10:30,577
So that was the first step

194
00:10:31,637 --> 00:10:33,996
of joining a US element

195
00:10:33,997 --> 00:10:35,256
with Russian elements:

196
00:10:35,257 --> 00:10:37,467
the beginning of the assembly of ISS.

197
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:41,418
Here you have a summary
of the utilizations of the Space Shuttle

198
00:10:41,418 --> 00:10:43,971
during 30 years
from 1981, the first flight,

199
00:10:43,972 --> 00:10:45,855
until 2011, the last one.

200
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:49,812
We had a total of 135 missions.

201
00:10:50,203 --> 00:10:53,378
Unfortunately, two missions
that ended up in accidents.

202
00:10:54,876 --> 00:10:58,794
We had Enterprise, the test vehicle
for the approach and landing tests.

203
00:10:59,206 --> 00:11:01,135
And then, we have five orbiters

204
00:11:01,136 --> 00:11:04,431
with the unfortunate loss
of Columbia and of Challenger.

205
00:11:04,432 --> 00:11:06,198
So, at the end of the program,

206
00:11:06,199 --> 00:11:10,596
we only had Atlantis,
Discovery and Endeavour.

207
00:11:11,532 --> 00:11:14,041
Again, a total of 135 missions,

208
00:11:14,042 --> 00:11:18,060
and quite a remarkable accomplishment
by the Space Shuttle,

209
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:20,710
which was a very remarkable vehicle

210
00:11:20,711 --> 00:11:22,584
with incredible capabilities.
