Well, we're going to go to orbit in this video, but first this is a view of the Shuttle on the launchpad.
It happens to be the Shuttle Discovery on the launchpad at Kennedy Space Center.
I just want to show you the access to the cabin.
We had an elevator going to this level.
Then we had a bridge giving access to the so-called White Room, where the crew with the help of technicians was making the last preparations before getting into the Space Shuttle orbiter cabin.
And here we are in the White Room,
I happen to be here.
This was on Shuttle mission 75, my third flight in 1996.
And we have Scott Horowitz, the pilot of this mission.
And you see here in the background, the hatch that was giving access to the mid deck of the orbiter, then we're transitioning to the flight deck.
This is a view with a camera looking downwards toward the center of the Earth of the crew in the flight deck, four crew members total.
We have the commander here.
We have the pilots and we have two mission specialists.
This is the mission specialist number 2, who was sitting between the commander and the pilot who was a flight engineer for the ascent and entry.
And we had a fourth crew member here in the flight deck.
This was interesting because we see here a technician who has a normal attitude of his body with his feet towards the center of the Earth.
And the aft bulkhead of the flight deck has become the floor for this technician, and you see, by the way, the aft windows that have been covered so as to avoid damaging them with the feet of the technician or any crew member.
So the crew members are basically lying on the back of their seat with their feet up.
This is also the preparation before launch in the mid deck.
Again, the crew members are lying on the back of their seats, and in the front towards their feet is basically the floor of the mid deck.
And on the top here is the forward bulkhead of the mid deck with all the lockers.
And you see that everyone has an orange Launch and Entry Suit and helmet, and there was a possibility of pressurizing the suit in case there was any problem with the cabin pressure during the ascent.
There was a way of saving the crew in this way.
There was also a possibility to technically explode the side hatch for rapid escape in case there was a launch abort and the crew had to escape rapidly, of course, before liftoff of the orbiter.
Then the crew member on the far end was the one responsible for exploding the side hatch, and then the crew members had in a given order to exit the Space Shuttle and then escape the launchpad.
Here we are going to see a nice video of the liftoff of the Space Shuttle.
More precisely, we'll see just about the last minute of the countdown prior to start of the Space Shuttle main engines, which is about six seconds before liftoff, and at the time T-zero, we have Solid Rocket Booster ignition, and at the same we had eight bolts fixing the Solid Rocket Booster in the bottom of the Solid Rocket Booster pyrotechnically exploded, and then the whole assembly was left free, and the thrust being about 1.5 times the weight of the Space Shuttle, the whole stack was moving to the vertical.
So we'll see the initial liftoff with shortly after the roll maneuver in order to come into the proper plane of the planned orbit which could be anything between about 28.5 degrees, which is a minimum, the latitude of Kennedy Space Center, all the way to about 52 degrees which is the inclination that we have for the International 
Space Station.
And then you see the ascent until Solid Rocket Booster separation in a few seconds later.

Well, the ascent to orbit is always a very exciting time of any space mission.
It's the part of the mission that you remember forever.
Really amazing.
Now, what we saw at the end of the Shuttle ascent video was the separation of the Solid Rocket Boosters, which fall down into the ocean.
They were recovered for later flights.
Then we continue the ascent to orbit for 6.5 extra minutes, for 8.5 total minutes.
And at the end of this ascent phase, in fact the end is not so much ascent.
It's more acceleration to the velocity of 20,000 km/hour or about Mach 76,
76 the speed of sound.
At the end of this ascent segment, we had acceleration of 3 G,
3 G longitudinal, it was velocity added to the velocity.
Then, main engine cutoff, and we went from 3 G to 0 G within a very short time-- about a second and a half.
And then the 0 G that we had was what was going to be with us for the remaining 8 days, 10 days or 12 or 14 days of the mission.
Really always to be remembered, section of the mission, ascent to space.
Main engine cutoff, separation of the tank, the tank had a very low ballistic coefficient.
We were at about 120 km or so in the very high atmosphere, we can say.
And the tank fell down on Earth after about 45 minutes.
The geometry of the ascent and the main engine cutoff was such that the tank had to fall down in the Pacific Ocean.
The Shuttle orbiter with a much larger ballistic coefficient was continuing its ascent to the apogee of the orbit.
In fact, the flight path angle at main engine cutoff was slightly positive, so we're going towards the apogee of an elliptical orbit who were on an orbital arc toward the high point of our orbit.
At the high point, typically about 300 km above the Earth's surface, so well outside of the atmosphere, we had to give an acceleration boost.
It was so-called OMS-2 burn in order to circularize at that altitude.
And we opened the payload bay doors shortly afterwards, and this is the view that we had.
Really, an amazing view.
You see the cargo bay of the Shuttle.
You had here the docking interface with the International Space Station.
You had the tail of the orbiter with the vertical stabilizer, the Earth in the background.
This is the robotic arm on the port side of the fuselage sill.
We get to work pretty rapidly.
In fact, after main engine cutoff, we have to configure the spaceship in an orbital configuration in terms of loading a new software load for the on orbit phase.
And we get to work.
The view is fantastic, but we have a flight plan with a scheduled activity for each crew member.
We get to work.
Most of the activities of the crew members during the on orbit phase is in the aft part of the flight deck.
Here you see the aft flight deck with the two windows giving the visual access to the payload bay and two overhead windows, two large windows about 60 by 60 cm, a very good optical quality.
So we had really a good view of either the Earth or the stars above.
And on this picture, you have two crew members busy, the one on the right-hand side is at the control station of the robotic arm.
In fact, his right hand is on the rotation hand controller for control of the robotic arm and his left hand on the translation hand controller with another crew member watching.
