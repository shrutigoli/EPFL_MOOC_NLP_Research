00:00:04,667 --> 00:00:06,421
The Space Shuttle program:

2
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:10,385
This video will be mainly about
the first flight STS-1,

3
00:00:10,386 --> 00:00:12,209
in April, 1981,

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:16,175
but let me go quickly
through the overall program.

5
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:19,164
We had the Approach
and Landing Test in 1977,

6
00:00:19,165 --> 00:00:21,855
we talked about that before,
in the previous video.

7
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:25,917
Then we had OFTs,
for Orbital Flight Tests.

8
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,754
Tests of the system, STS-1,
the first flight, until STS-4,

9
00:00:31,755 --> 00:00:34,515
between April 1981 and 1982.

10
00:00:35,089 --> 00:00:38,903
Then we had the operational phase
STS-5, in 1982,

11
00:00:38,904 --> 00:00:44,263
through STS-135,
135 flights total, in 2011.

12
00:00:44,678 --> 00:00:47,993
Now, the reason why I talked about
the Shuttle quite a lot

13
00:00:47,994 --> 00:00:52,734
in this course, is that
it was a major undertaking.

14
00:00:53,435 --> 00:00:57,603
In the first program
it was a really difficult effort

15
00:00:58,023 --> 00:01:02,022
from NASA and the aerospace industry
in the US,

16
00:01:02,023 --> 00:01:04,762
to bring together
in an operational status

17
00:01:04,763 --> 00:01:08,022
a winged spacecraft
nearly totally reusable.

18
00:01:08,023 --> 00:01:10,722
It allowed also a lot of people
to go into space,

19
00:01:10,723 --> 00:01:13,416
it allowed the Hubble program,

20
00:01:13,417 --> 00:01:16,332
it made also the Space Station
assembly possible,

21
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:18,104
so it was really a major undertaking.

22
00:01:18,224 --> 00:01:19,543
I had also the privilege,

23
00:01:19,553 --> 00:01:24,022
in this section here,
on the 46th shuttle flight,

24
00:01:24,023 --> 00:01:28,222
and the the 61st and then 75th,
and then flight number 103,

25
00:01:28,223 --> 00:01:30,003
to be on board.

26
00:01:30,466 --> 00:01:33,895
So my knowledge of the shuttle,
from an operation point of view,

27
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:35,245
is quite extensive.

28
00:01:35,246 --> 00:01:38,146
And again, it's a major program;
I want to share with you

29
00:01:38,167 --> 00:01:43,115
some of its capabilities, performance,
and all of what it offered

30
00:01:43,115 --> 00:01:45,786
to the Space Exploration program.

31
00:01:46,693 --> 00:01:48,552
Here we have the crew of STS-1,

32
00:01:48,553 --> 00:01:52,282
the crew selected
for the very first shuttle flight.

33
00:01:52,283 --> 00:01:56,002
It was rather amazing
that a completely new spacecraft,

34
00:01:56,003 --> 00:01:58,482
compared with
what it had been operated before;

35
00:01:58,483 --> 00:02:00,672
it was going to be flown
for the first time,

36
00:02:00,673 --> 00:02:02,143
with a crew on board.

37
00:02:03,593 --> 00:02:06,248
It was definitely a very critical mission,

38
00:02:06,249 --> 00:02:07,707
very dangerous also,

39
00:02:07,708 --> 00:02:10,400
because of the novelty
of the Shuttle architecture

40
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:13,822
and the overall operational scenario,

41
00:02:13,823 --> 00:02:16,686
it was completely different
from what we had before;

42
00:02:16,687 --> 00:02:20,317
with the external tank,
solid rocket boosters,

43
00:02:20,334 --> 00:02:24,204
and our asymmetrically located orbiter.

44
00:02:24,205 --> 00:02:29,833
It was really a very new configuration
vs. everything that had been flown before

45
00:02:29,834 --> 00:02:33,833
which was basically
of cylindrical symmetry.

46
00:02:33,834 --> 00:02:36,626
All the rockets are cylindrical
in their symmetry.

47
00:02:36,627 --> 00:02:38,960
These are John Young and Bob Crippen.

48
00:02:38,961 --> 00:02:42,014
John Young was
a very experienced astronaut;

49
00:02:42,015 --> 00:02:44,944
he had flown on
the Gemini Program two times,

50
00:02:44,945 --> 00:02:46,584
and in the Apollo Program also.

51
00:02:46,585 --> 00:02:48,904
He was the Commander of Apollo 16.

52
00:02:48,905 --> 00:02:53,244
And he was the Commander
of this first flight of the Space Shuttle,

53
00:02:53,245 --> 00:02:54,844
together with Bob Crippen;

54
00:02:54,845 --> 00:02:57,164
and he flew again, John Young,

55
00:02:57,165 --> 00:02:59,024
on the 9th Shuttle flight,

56
00:02:59,025 --> 00:03:02,575
which was also the first flight
of the European Spacelab.

57
00:03:02,914 --> 00:03:05,134
So this is the crew of STS-1.

58
00:03:05,932 --> 00:03:08,011
Now, obviously, before the first flight,

59
00:03:08,012 --> 00:03:12,011
it was a lot of preparation,
testing of all the components,

60
00:03:12,012 --> 00:03:14,070
including the software
of the Space Shuttle.

61
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:19,821
This is a winged spacecraft,
but its flyby wire system,

62
00:03:19,822 --> 00:03:22,961
all of the inputs of the crew,
on the controls,

63
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:25,051
are translated by computers

64
00:03:25,052 --> 00:03:28,861
into movement of the area surfaces,
or faring of the thrusters,

65
00:03:28,862 --> 00:03:32,081
so, there was, for the first time,
a lot of software involved.

66
00:03:32,082 --> 00:03:33,561
A lot of training also.

67
00:03:33,562 --> 00:03:36,762
This is John Young and Bob Crippen.

68
00:03:36,935 --> 00:03:39,564
John Young is on the commander seat,
on the left side,

69
00:03:39,565 --> 00:03:42,314
and Bob Crippen, on the pilot seat,
on the right side.

70
00:03:42,315 --> 00:03:46,314
And you see the complexity
of the cockpit of the Space Shuttle,

71
00:03:46,315 --> 00:03:47,784
this is in the simulator,

72
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:52,214
but it is simulating exactly the geometry
and all of the features of the cockpit.

73
00:03:52,215 --> 00:03:57,166
And for this first flight,
and for the whole OFT,

74
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:58,751
Orbital Flight Test,

75
00:03:58,775 --> 00:04:00,834
the crew was wearing special suits,

76
00:04:00,835 --> 00:04:02,544
and they had ejection seats also,

77
00:04:02,545 --> 00:04:03,837
in case there was a problem

78
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:06,407
during the initial part
of the ascent to orbit;

79
00:04:06,408 --> 00:04:08,224
they had the possibility of ejecting.

80
00:04:08,225 --> 00:04:12,224
The ejection seats were removed
from STS-5 on;

81
00:04:12,225 --> 00:04:15,935
for the whole operational flight
of the Shuttle Program,

82
00:04:15,936 --> 00:04:18,752
we had normal crew escape capability.

83
00:04:19,281 --> 00:04:21,921
STS-1--this is the Shuttle Columbia

84
00:04:21,922 --> 00:04:25,031
on the launch pad
at the Kennedy Space Center,

85
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:27,972
shortly before the planned lift-off.

86
00:04:28,654 --> 00:04:32,214
Lift-off on April, the 12th, 1981:

87
00:04:32,918 --> 00:04:36,916
interestingly enough, this was exactly
20 years after the flight of Gagarin.

88
00:04:36,917 --> 00:04:38,573
It was not planned this way:

89
00:04:38,574 --> 00:04:42,343
in fact, the first flight of Columbia
was planned a few days earlier

90
00:04:42,344 --> 00:04:44,689
but it was delayed
because of a technical program,

91
00:04:44,809 --> 00:04:47,291
and it happened that it just occurred

92
00:04:47,292 --> 00:04:50,709
on the 20th anniversary
of Yuri Gagarin's flight.

93
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:53,153
Everything went fine
for the ascent to orbit,

94
00:04:53,154 --> 00:04:54,723
and here we are on orbit.

95
00:04:54,724 --> 00:04:57,393
John Young and Bob Crippen
commanded

96
00:04:57,394 --> 00:04:59,763
payload bay doors
in the open position,

97
00:04:59,764 --> 00:05:05,291
and there were two windows
in the back of the Shuttle cockpit

98
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:08,709
that allowed the crew to see
what was occurring at payload bay.

99
00:05:08,734 --> 00:05:12,733
And to the surprise, and I must say,
their concern, you see

100
00:05:12,734 --> 00:05:16,143
that there were
some thermal protection tiles

101
00:05:16,144 --> 00:05:18,693
that were missing in the aft pod.

102
00:05:18,694 --> 00:05:19,953
As mentioned before,

103
00:05:19,954 --> 00:05:23,208
this is is not an area that it has
a lot of heat during the re-entry,

104
00:05:23,209 --> 00:05:24,738
but it was still a concern.

105
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:29,373
The question was, "Do we have
any thermal protection tiles

106
00:05:29,374 --> 00:05:31,933
on the bottom of the Orbiter,
the black tiles,

107
00:05:31,934 --> 00:05:33,603
that were missing also?"

108
00:05:33,604 --> 00:05:35,363
So, there was really some concern

109
00:05:35,364 --> 00:05:39,363
and there was no way to verify

110
00:05:39,364 --> 00:05:41,913
whether we had any missing tiles
at the bottom,

111
00:05:41,914 --> 00:05:44,929
so we were just hoping that things
would be OK for the re-entry.

112
00:05:45,049 --> 00:05:47,059
Things went fine for the re-entry

113
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,829
thanks God! 

114
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:51,130
and we have here

115
00:05:52,556 --> 00:05:55,965
a short video
of the final approach to land

116
00:05:55,966 --> 00:05:59,725
at Edwards
or Dryden Research Center in California.

117
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:01,258
The landing was going to be

118
00:06:01,259 --> 00:06:03,625
on the dried lakebed
not on the runaway,

119
00:06:03,656 --> 00:06:05,645
because the dried lakebed is very large,

120
00:06:05,646 --> 00:06:07,333
and there was also the possibility

121
00:06:07,334 --> 00:06:09,679
to be a little bit short,
maybe a little bit long,

122
00:06:09,686 --> 00:06:11,565
there was a lot of forgiveness there,

123
00:06:11,566 --> 00:06:13,606
landing on the lakebed.

124
00:06:14,401 --> 00:06:17,320
What you'll see, the final approach
on the steep glide slope,

125
00:06:17,321 --> 00:06:20,374
then you see the pre-flare,
getting to the shallow glide slope

126
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:22,792
and ready to belate
deployment of the landing gear;

127
00:06:23,359 --> 00:06:25,099
then the touchdown on the lakebed.

128
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:26,645
It's quite a nice video.

129
00:06:26,646 --> 00:06:28,215
There was a lot of emotion
at that time.

130
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:29,405
That was the first time

131
00:06:29,406 --> 00:06:32,455
that the spaceship was going
to land on a runway.

132
00:06:32,456 --> 00:06:36,415
So it was a first and quite
a remarkable accomplishment

133
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:39,545
by NASA, the aerospace industry,

134
00:06:39,546 --> 00:06:43,065
and the whole team
that had prepared the mission

135
00:06:43,066 --> 00:06:45,905
and supported the mission,

136
00:06:45,906 --> 00:06:48,490
and obviously, by the crew,
John Young and Bob Crippen.

137
00:06:48,802 --> 00:06:51,132
And here we see, post-landing,

138
00:06:52,242 --> 00:06:53,801
John, the commander,

139
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:55,762
and Bob Crippen;

140
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,759
John is already here,
he's come down the stairs

141
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,120
and this is the pilot, Crippen,
coming down the stairs.

142
00:07:02,448 --> 00:07:04,410
There was a lot of emotions at that time.

143
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:07,737
Again, it was
the first in the space program.

144
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:10,737
You see some details of the orbiter
that I'd like to point at:

145
00:07:10,738 --> 00:07:13,217
you see the detail of the tiles,
the black tiles,

146
00:07:13,218 --> 00:07:15,487
that are designed

147
00:07:15,488 --> 00:07:21,257
for protecting the orbiter against
the highest heat during the re-entry.

148
00:07:21,258 --> 00:07:23,388
You see all the white tiles here.

149
00:07:24,507 --> 00:07:28,506
And in the front of the fuselage,

150
00:07:28,507 --> 00:07:33,077
you see some
of the reaction control system nozzles.

151
00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:39,808
These are nozzles of the thrusters
that allow a change

152
00:07:39,809 --> 00:07:44,468
in the orientation or attitude
of the orbiter during the orbit phase,

153
00:07:44,469 --> 00:07:47,189
and also, take out the toxs
during the re-entry.
