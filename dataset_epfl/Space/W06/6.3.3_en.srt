1
00:00:04,531 --> 00:00:07,553
Following the Challenger accident 
in January 1986

2
00:00:07,553 --> 00:00:11,399
and after implementation 
of the recommendations

3
00:00:11,399 --> 00:00:14,133
of the Rogers Commission 
that did the investigation

4
00:00:14,133 --> 00:00:16,773
on the cause of the accident,

5
00:00:16,773 --> 00:00:21,793
NASA had 17 years 
of accident-free Shuttle operation

6
00:00:21,919 --> 00:00:25,102
at the end of the 80's, 
during the whole 90's

7
00:00:25,102 --> 00:00:28,102
and the beginning of the year 2000.

8
00:00:28,102 --> 00:00:32,234
Unfortunately STS-107,

9
00:00:32,234 --> 00:00:37,824
which lifted off in January 2003

10
00:00:37,824 --> 00:00:42,870
had another accident 
during the re-entry of the spaceship

11
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:44,575
about two weeks later.

12
00:00:44,575 --> 00:00:49,865
And this is a view of the Shuttle 
ascending to orbit--

13
00:00:49,865 --> 00:00:53,191
the first stage where we have 
two Solid Rocket Boosters

14
00:00:53,191 --> 00:00:55,521
and three hydrogen engines.

15
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:59,426
And this is seen from a camera--
it was close to the launchpad,

16
00:00:59,426 --> 00:01:02,669
so we only see
the bottom of the vehicle,

17
00:01:02,669 --> 00:01:08,196
but at this point you see that there is
a piece of thermal protection

18
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:12,522
of the external tank 
that has detached from the tank,

19
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:15,112
and you see it moving towards the wing,

20
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:20,181
and at this point obviously 
these pictures we're not seeing real time

21
00:01:20,181 --> 00:01:23,833
but obviously it has 
probably hit the wing,

22
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,793
and just later you see
that there is powder

23
00:01:26,793 --> 00:01:29,793
close to the trailing edge 
of the left wing

24
00:01:29,793 --> 00:01:33,849
indicating clearly that it had hit 
the leading edge of the wing.

25
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:38,620
NASA did a study, 
and they came to the conclusion

26
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:42,495
that this is foam, it's low density,

27
00:01:42,495 --> 00:01:47,145
and in all probability
it had not caused any damage

28
00:01:47,145 --> 00:01:49,845
to the leading edge of the wing.

29
00:01:49,845 --> 00:01:53,628
So the mission continued,
the ascent continued normally,

30
00:01:53,628 --> 00:01:57,787
and the mission took place 
for about two weeks.

31
00:01:57,787 --> 00:02:00,395
It was a mission 
that was an autonomous mission.

32
00:02:00,395 --> 00:02:03,545
In the middle of a set of missions 
that had as an objective

33
00:02:03,545 --> 00:02:06,157
to assemble 
the International Space Station,

34
00:02:06,157 --> 00:02:09,079
this one was not bound 
to the International Space Station--

35
00:02:09,079 --> 00:02:11,109
it was an autonomous science mission.

36
00:02:11,109 --> 00:02:14,486
Now we will be able to see 
in a rapid motion

37
00:02:14,486 --> 00:02:18,566
the detachment of this piece of foam 
from the external tank

38
00:02:18,566 --> 00:02:21,670
hitting the wing and then fragmented

39
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,850
close to the trailing edge of the wing.

40
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:27,840
And that's what was seen 
not at the time of the launch itself,

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,955
but it was seen afterwards, of course.

42
00:02:29,955 --> 00:02:32,510
All these pictures were analyzed 
after the launch.

43
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,066
This is the view 
of the Mission Control Center

44
00:02:35,066 --> 00:02:39,661
during the re-entry of Columbia 
on the 1st of February of 2003,

45
00:02:39,661 --> 00:02:42,890
just at the time there was 
a loss of contact with Columbia.

46
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:45,053
You see the trajectory here in yellow

47
00:02:45,053 --> 00:02:51,010
and about the area of Dallas-Fort Worth 
the contact was lost with Columbia.

48
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:56,427
And these are very tragic views 
that people had in this area of Texas

49
00:02:56,427 --> 00:02:58,736
around Dallas-Fort Worth.

50
00:02:58,736 --> 00:03:00,790
It was very early in the morning,

51
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,220
and we could see not one trail 
of the re-entry of the Shuttle,

52
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:10,250
like was seen usually, but obviously 
the spaceship had broken up.

53
00:03:10,342 --> 00:03:15,158
It was another tragedy for NASA--
personal tragedy, first,

54
00:03:15,158 --> 00:03:17,827
because of the loss of life 
of the seven crew members.

55
00:03:19,237 --> 00:03:23,460
Obviously there was an investigation 
that was put in place:

56
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:27,797
the CAIB--Columbia Accident 
Investigation Board.

57
00:03:28,867 --> 00:03:33,507
They did some tests of the effects

58
00:03:33,511 --> 00:03:38,194
of the impact of a piece of foam 
from the external tank

59
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:40,247
to the leading edge of the wing,

60
00:03:40,247 --> 00:03:44,317
and you see the setup for the test
on the left-hand side,

61
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:46,560
and you see the result 
on the right-hand side.

62
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,659
Obviously, unlike what NASA had thought

63
00:03:49,659 --> 00:03:53,239
when they saw these videos 
that I showed before,

64
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,826
this piece of foam had done damage 
to the leading edge of the wing,

65
00:03:57,826 --> 00:04:00,549
and, of course, if you have
a hole like this one,

66
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:02,610
a pretty large hole, during the re-entry,

67
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:06,270
you have the hot gases 
coming inside the wing,

68
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:08,486
and the wing is made of aluminium

69
00:04:08,486 --> 00:04:11,265
and if you have a temperature 
of close to 1000 degrees

70
00:04:11,265 --> 00:04:13,005
it is going to melt the aluminium,

71
00:04:13,005 --> 00:04:17,407
and obviously Columbia had been
destroyed because of that hole

72
00:04:17,407 --> 00:04:20,568
caused by this impact 
of the foam during launch.

73
00:04:20,568 --> 00:04:24,241
Obviously another
thorough investigation, as mentioned,

74
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:28,941
and a set of recommendations 
given to NASA.

75
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:32,062
For a while there was the idea that maybe
the program would stop completely,

76
00:04:32,062 --> 00:04:35,626
but the International Space Station 
was still in assembly phase

77
00:04:35,626 --> 00:04:37,456
and not fully assembled,

78
00:04:37,456 --> 00:04:40,378
and NASA decided to just continue 
with the Shuttle program

79
00:04:40,378 --> 00:04:42,951
and respect all the agreements

80
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:45,951
with the partners 
of the International Space Station.

81
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,174
The main recommendations 
were really, first of all,

82
00:04:49,174 --> 00:04:51,237
to fix the problem of detachment

83
00:04:51,237 --> 00:04:54,187
of thermal protection 
from the external tank,

84
00:04:54,187 --> 00:04:58,297
but also give a possibility
to the crew to do inspections

85
00:04:58,297 --> 00:05:01,260
of the thermal protection system
while on orbit

86
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:05,685
and be sure there was no fatal damage 
to this thermal protection,

87
00:05:05,685 --> 00:05:09,721
and also there was a possibility 
for the crew to do repair, space walking,

88
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:13,661
and they had all the tools 
and materials to do repair

89
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:15,601
of the Shuttle thermal protection system

90
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:18,349
in case it was needed for a safe re-entry.

91
00:05:18,349 --> 00:05:22,078
And also all of the missions 
had as an objective--except one--

92
00:05:22,078 --> 00:05:27,099
had as an objective assembly 
of the International Space Station,

93
00:05:27,099 --> 00:05:32,799
so in case any severe damage,
irreparable, would have been detected

94
00:05:32,799 --> 00:05:36,600
the crew could have taken place 
in the International Space Station

95
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:42,288
waiting for rescue by another Shuttle 
some time later,

96
00:05:42,288 --> 00:05:44,036
except that there was one mission

97
00:05:44,036 --> 00:05:46,366
that did not go 
to the International Space Station--

98
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:50,740
that was the last servicing mission 
of Hubble, STS-125,

99
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,329
but NASA decided eventually 
to still take the risk

100
00:05:53,329 --> 00:05:56,859
with another Shuttle on the launchpad
ready to go and rescue the crew

101
00:05:56,859 --> 00:06:02,213
in case there was going to be 
a detection of fatal damage

102
00:06:02,213 --> 00:06:06,313
to the thermal protection system 
of the Shuttle on this mission.
