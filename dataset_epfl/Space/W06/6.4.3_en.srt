1
00:00:05,256 --> 00:00:08,296
We'll talk about logistics supply
to ISS right now.

2
00:00:09,286 --> 00:00:12,976
Of course, we don't only
have to bring people up there,

3
00:00:13,046 --> 00:00:16,246
astronauts and cosmonauts
and back to Earth,

4
00:00:16,246 --> 00:00:19,696
we also need to have
the capability to bring cargo

5
00:00:19,696 --> 00:00:22,316
to bring fuel, to bring water

6
00:00:22,316 --> 00:00:26,416
out of which the oxygen
is provided on board the station

7
00:00:27,131 --> 00:00:31,531
and various equipment,
experiments and obviously food

8
00:00:31,984 --> 00:00:36,484
and we also need to have the capability
to bring things back down to Earth.

9
00:00:36,964 --> 00:00:40,360
We're talking about equipment
or trash.

10
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:45,487
When we have trash, of course,
we don't let it go into space freely

11
00:00:45,487 --> 00:00:48,787
but we want to have
a planned return to Earth,

12
00:00:48,807 --> 00:00:51,757
destructive reentry of trash to Earth.

13
00:00:52,755 --> 00:00:57,225
These are the systems
that have been used so far

14
00:00:57,225 --> 00:01:00,857
for supplying cargo 
to the International Space Station.

15
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,840
This is the Progress
we've talked about before.

16
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,060
This is provided by Japan,
it's the so-called HTV.

17
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:10,218
This is the Dragon from the
US commercial company Space X.

18
00:01:11,268 --> 00:01:14,327
This is ATV. We've already
talked about ATV before.

19
00:01:14,352 --> 00:01:19,762
It's a pretty large
supplier of cargo to ISS.

20
00:01:19,762 --> 00:01:22,272
It flew five times,
provided by ESA

21
00:01:22,277 --> 00:01:24,127
but it's no longer
in operation.

22
00:01:24,707 --> 00:01:30,507
And here we have two versions 
of the so-called Cygnus cargo spacecraft

23
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:34,837
that is provided by Orbital Sciences.
This is a somewhat older version.

24
00:01:34,837 --> 00:01:38,930
This is a new version 
of the Cygnus cargo spacecraft

25
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:42,624
bound to the International Space Station
with the round solar arrays.

26
00:01:42,624 --> 00:01:46,098
Here we have
a comparison of the sizes

27
00:01:46,098 --> 00:01:50,150
and also the docking interfaces
of these various cargo vehicles

28
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,967
for the International Space Station

29
00:01:51,967 --> 00:01:55,247
and we have a comparison
with the Apollo spacecraft.

30
00:01:56,957 --> 00:01:59,904
On the far left we have
the HTV from Japan.

31
00:02:00,554 --> 00:02:06,154
The interface of HTV 
to the International Space Station

32
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:09,705
is such that it can be docked
to the USOS part

33
00:02:09,705 --> 00:02:11,327
of the International Space Station,

34
00:02:11,327 --> 00:02:16,396
either top or bottom ports of Node 2,

35
00:02:16,396 --> 00:02:19,475
which is at the front 
of the International Space Station.

36
00:02:20,485 --> 00:02:22,605
Here you see the ATV,
Automatic Transfer Vehicle,

37
00:02:22,605 --> 00:02:26,484
no longer used but it was used
five times as I mentioned before.

38
00:02:26,484 --> 00:02:29,677
About the same size as HTV.

39
00:02:29,677 --> 00:02:33,654
It could carry about 7 tonnes
of freight to ISS.

40
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:36,724
And you see the docking
interface is the same

41
00:02:36,735 --> 00:02:38,605
as the Progress or Soyuz.

42
00:02:39,809 --> 00:02:44,089
Docking or mating with ISS
is always done

43
00:02:44,089 --> 00:02:47,756
in the rear port of ISS
in the Russian segment.

44
00:02:47,756 --> 00:02:49,978
We already talked
about Progress before.

45
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:51,698
You see the same interface here.

46
00:02:51,698 --> 00:02:55,501
A somewhat smaller
resupply vehicle to ISS

47
00:02:55,501 --> 00:02:59,824
able to carry about 2 tonnes
of freight and propellant and water.

48
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:03,787
There was an interesting situation
at the beginning of 2011

49
00:03:03,787 --> 00:03:07,268
when we had a grand total
of 6 visiting vehicles at ISS.

50
00:03:07,268 --> 00:03:09,048
Of course, we had the Shuttle here.

51
00:03:09,072 --> 00:03:12,972
This is the US segment

52
00:03:12,972 --> 00:03:15,920
and this is the Russian segment.

53
00:03:18,993 --> 00:03:26,093
We had the Space Shuttle
on the top ports of Node 2.

54
00:03:26,093 --> 00:03:27,938
This is Node 2.

55
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:32,145
We had the HTV

56
00:03:32,145 --> 00:03:35,285
and we could also have had
one at the bottom port.

57
00:03:35,285 --> 00:03:36,964
We could have had a Dragon, for instance.

58
00:03:36,964 --> 00:03:39,053
The Dragon as well as HTV

59
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:43,658
are always docked to ISS
via the US segment.

60
00:03:43,988 --> 00:03:48,618
And on the Russian side, we have
two Soyuz's and one Progress.

61
00:03:48,618 --> 00:03:52,518
One Soyuz, another Soyuz
and a Progress.

62
00:03:52,962 --> 00:03:56,162
And sometimes there's a capability
for the crew, the Russian crew,

63
00:03:56,162 --> 00:04:00,472
to move Soyuz
from one port to the other.

64
00:04:00,472 --> 00:04:04,001
They go in the ascent
and descent module

65
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:06,831
and they have thrusters
that they can use

66
00:04:06,831 --> 00:04:09,719
via rotational and translational
hand controllers

67
00:04:09,719 --> 00:04:12,359
in order to move
from one place to the other.

68
00:04:12,359 --> 00:04:15,692
and here in the back,
using the same interface,

69
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:17,762
we had ATV too at that time.

70
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:21,858
So a grand total of 6 visiting vehicles
at ISS at that time.

71
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:25,914
That's a nice picture of a Progress

72
00:04:25,946 --> 00:04:29,746
as it's getting close to docking
with the International Space Station.

73
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:32,578
Again, as well, Soyuz and Progress

74
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:36,290
normally go through
an automatic final approach

75
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,930
and docking to ISS,

76
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:41,750
although with the Soyuz
we can have manual takeover

77
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:45,151
of the control from inside
by the commander inside the Soyuz

78
00:04:45,151 --> 00:04:47,648
to do a manual
approach and docking,

79
00:04:47,648 --> 00:04:49,328
which has been done a few times.

80
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:53,268
This is a Progress.
The only difference with a Soyuz

81
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:57,132
is that the so-called
descent module of Soyuz

82
00:04:57,132 --> 00:04:58,688
is replaced by this segment here

83
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:02,648
which is basically used
as a propellant tank,

84
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:07,064
not so much
for the Progress itself

85
00:05:07,064 --> 00:05:12,204
but bringing propellant or fuel
to the International Space Station.

86
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:14,952
And, of course, we have
the on-orbit module

87
00:05:14,965 --> 00:05:17,115
and the service module
with the solar array,

88
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:19,505
so very similar to the
Soyuz manned spacecraft.

89
00:05:20,243 --> 00:05:23,923
Another view, a very nice view,
of ATV shortly before docking,

90
00:05:23,963 --> 00:05:27,873
again, to the rear part of ISS
and the Russian segment.

91
00:05:27,873 --> 00:05:30,197
This is the docking interface
which we see here,

92
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,547
the four solar arrays.

93
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:35,660
A very capable vehicle and
quite a learning experience for ESA

94
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:39,171
which had to develop
all the automatic rendezvous

95
00:05:39,171 --> 00:05:41,511
and all the sensors
for the final approach

96
00:05:41,536 --> 00:05:43,486
and rendezvous
and docking to ISS.

97
00:05:44,005 --> 00:05:46,555
As mentioned before,
all the resupply spacecraft

98
00:05:46,585 --> 00:05:49,835
that get to the International 
Space Station

99
00:05:49,835 --> 00:05:51,125
on the Russian segment,

100
00:05:51,125 --> 00:05:53,896
whether it's ATV in the past
or Progress right now,

101
00:05:53,896 --> 00:05:57,199
directly dock to ports
on the Russian segment.

102
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:02,000
But the other resupply vehicles
as well as the HTV from Japan,

103
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,249
which we see here,

104
00:06:03,249 --> 00:06:07,264
come into the vicinity
of the International Space Station

105
00:06:07,264 --> 00:06:11,128
they fly formation, they are controlled 
to come and fly formation,

106
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:14,295
and then they are grappled 
with the space station robotic arm

107
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:17,580
normally commanded from the cupola
of the International Space Station

108
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:20,266
and they become in a docking position

109
00:06:20,329 --> 00:06:24,189
either on top or in the bottom of Node 2.

110
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:27,551
It's the same for the Dragon vehicle
provided by Space X.

111
00:06:27,551 --> 00:06:34,221
Right now we have the HTV,
the Dragon and the Cygnus vehicles

112
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:37,966
which all three are grappled
with the robotic arm

113
00:06:38,029 --> 00:06:40,899
on the docking port
on the US segment.

114
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:42,347
Already in 2006,

115
00:06:42,347 --> 00:06:45,612
before the last flight
of the Space Shuttle in 2011,

116
00:06:45,612 --> 00:06:48,304
NASA had developed
the so-called COTS program

117
00:06:48,304 --> 00:06:50,815
Commercial Orbital
Transportation Services.

118
00:06:50,815 --> 00:06:54,720
The idea was to be able
to provide transportation

119
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,960
of cargo and freight,
and fuel and water

120
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,112
from US soil to the
International Space Station.

121
00:07:00,112 --> 00:07:06,572
So there was sponsoring of companies
which were on the one hand willing

122
00:07:06,594 --> 00:07:10,044
and had the capability
to develop these systems.

123
00:07:10,087 --> 00:07:16,137
And later this developed into the
Commercial Crew Development (CCDev).

124
00:07:16,195 --> 00:07:20,155
And we have three companies involved,
Space X on the one hand,

125
00:07:20,185 --> 00:07:23,655
Boeing and, more recently,
Sierra Nevada Corporation.

126
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:27,629
And then came 
the Commercial Resupply Services (CRS),

127
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:29,047
with two phases,

128
00:07:29,067 --> 00:07:31,447
Space X and Orbital Sciences
for the first phase

129
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:37,223
and, for the second phase, we add
Sierra Nevada Corporation.

130
00:07:37,263 --> 00:07:41,093
And meanwhile, Orbital Sciences
became Orbital ATK.

131
00:07:42,196 --> 00:07:46,235
These are the requirements given by NASA
to these commercial companies

132
00:07:46,235 --> 00:07:50,925
which will provide services 
to the International Space Station

133
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:55,095
as well as cargo
and personnel transfer.

134
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,160
NASA does the cargo pickup,
the cargo integration

135
00:08:00,884 --> 00:08:03,514
and the companies
have to provide these:

136
00:08:03,545 --> 00:08:06,705
on the one hand,
external cargo delivery and disposal,

137
00:08:06,707 --> 00:08:08,837
internal cargo delivery and disposal,

138
00:08:08,837 --> 00:08:11,066
internal cargo delivery and return,

139
00:08:11,066 --> 00:08:12,800
and crew transportation,

140
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,300
which is illustrated
by these four colors here.

141
00:08:17,288 --> 00:08:24,968
And there's also return,
which is part of this contract.

142
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:29,413
So the crew return, the cargo return
and the cargo trash disposal,

143
00:08:29,413 --> 00:08:31,633
these are the three elements.

144
00:08:32,194 --> 00:08:36,984
So this has started already
with Space X with the Dragon

145
00:08:37,055 --> 00:08:43,815
and Cygnus 
of the Orbital Sciences Corporation, ATK.

146
00:08:44,334 --> 00:08:47,074
And obviously we have the Japanese

147
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:49,254
that provide 
part of that service also now,

148
00:08:49,254 --> 00:08:51,584
but outside of the COTS contract, 
obviously.

149
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,160
Here we have a nice view of mating

150
00:08:55,207 --> 00:09:01,857
in the bottom ports of Node 2.

151
00:09:01,857 --> 00:09:05,227
You see here the mating interface
of the Dragon,

152
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,484
the Dragon resupply vehicle
for freight and cargo,

153
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:16,364
and you can see the robot arm
that has been used to grapple Dragon

154
00:09:16,364 --> 00:09:19,215
as it was flying
in close formation with ISS,

155
00:09:19,215 --> 00:09:23,205
grabbed by the crew and then installed 
in that docking interface.

156
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:28,387
A nice view of part of the Station.

157
00:09:28,387 --> 00:09:31,015
On the left-hand side,
the robot arm of the Station

158
00:09:31,015 --> 00:09:33,545
that has just grappled Cygnus,

159
00:09:33,545 --> 00:09:35,549
the last version
of the Cygnus spacecraft,

160
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:38,699
bringing resupply equipment to ISS.

161
00:09:39,226 --> 00:09:42,466
And this is an illustration,
an artist's illustration,

162
00:09:42,485 --> 00:09:44,785
of the cargo version
of the Dream Chaser.

163
00:09:44,847 --> 00:09:49,057
The Dream Chaser will be first 
of all used to bring crews,

164
00:09:49,057 --> 00:09:52,077
six to seven crew members,
to ISS and then back to Earth,

165
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:55,368
similarly to the Space Shuttle,
but in a much smaller size.

166
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,088
The later version of Dream Chaser
will be the cargo version,

167
00:09:59,095 --> 00:10:06,335
able to bring freight and equipment
to ISS and then back to Earth,

168
00:10:06,335 --> 00:10:11,333
not, of course, in a destructive mode
but it will fly back to the Earth

169
00:10:11,370 --> 00:10:14,070
pretty much like the Shuttle did
and land on a runway.
