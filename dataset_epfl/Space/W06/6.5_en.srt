We hope that you enjoyed 
this week with us.

2
00:00:07,688 --> 00:00:09,618
Thank you for your participation.

3
00:00:11,317 --> 00:00:14,738
I would like you to focus
on the concept presented in the unit.

4
00:00:14,738 --> 00:00:17,369
Once these concepts are clearly understood

5
00:00:17,369 --> 00:00:19,819
including the application 
of these concepts,

6
00:00:19,819 --> 00:00:22,259
you can take the final test of the unit.

7
00:00:23,547 --> 00:00:27,867
And I'd like to remind you
on the focus on space telescopes
