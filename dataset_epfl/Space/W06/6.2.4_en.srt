1
00:00:04,539 --> 00:00:07,425
Well, we're going to go 
to orbit in this video,

2
00:00:07,436 --> 00:00:12,209
but first this is a view
of the Shuttle on the launchpad.

3
00:00:12,209 --> 00:00:15,292
It happens to be the Shuttle Discovery
on the launchpad

4
00:00:15,292 --> 00:00:16,953
at Kennedy Space Center.

5
00:00:16,953 --> 00:00:19,605
I just want to show you the access
to the cabin.

6
00:00:19,605 --> 00:00:21,787
We had an elevator going to this level.

7
00:00:21,787 --> 00:00:26,954
Then we had a bridge giving access
to the so-called White Room,

8
00:00:26,954 --> 00:00:29,163
where the crew 
with the help of technicians

9
00:00:29,163 --> 00:00:30,988
was making the last preparations

10
00:00:30,988 --> 00:00:34,260
before getting 
into the Space Shuttle orbiter cabin.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,530
And here we are in the White Room,
I happen to be here.

12
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:45,761
This was on Shuttle mission 75,
my third flight in 1996.

13
00:00:45,761 --> 00:00:49,140
And we have Scott Horowitz, 
the pilot of this mission.

14
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:55,873
And you see here in the background,
the hatch that was giving access

15
00:00:55,873 --> 00:00:58,898
to the mid deck of the orbiter,
then we're transitioning

16
00:00:58,898 --> 00:01:00,554
to the flight deck.

17
00:01:00,554 --> 00:01:03,675
This is a view with a camera
looking downwards

18
00:01:03,675 --> 00:01:07,642
toward the center of the Earth
of the crew in the flight deck,

19
00:01:07,642 --> 00:01:09,979
four crew members total.

20
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,411
We have the commander here.

21
00:01:12,411 --> 00:01:16,335
We have the pilots
and we have two mission specialists.

22
00:01:16,335 --> 00:01:18,234
This is the mission specialist number 2,

23
00:01:18,234 --> 00:01:21,069
who was sitting 
between the commander and the pilot

24
00:01:21,069 --> 00:01:23,981
who was a flight engineer
for the ascent and entry.

25
00:01:23,981 --> 00:01:27,113
And we had a fourth crew member here
in the flight deck.

26
00:01:27,113 --> 00:01:30,138
This was interesting 
because we see here a technician

27
00:01:30,203 --> 00:01:32,916
who has a normal attitude of his body

28
00:01:32,916 --> 00:01:35,077
with his feet towards
the center of the Earth.

29
00:01:35,077 --> 00:01:40,545
And the aft bulkhead of the flight deck
has become the floor

30
00:01:40,545 --> 00:01:43,465
for this technician,
and you see, by the way,

31
00:01:43,465 --> 00:01:48,136
the aft windows that have been covered
so as to avoid damaging them

32
00:01:48,136 --> 00:01:50,938
with the feet of the technician
or any crew member.

33
00:01:50,938 --> 00:01:53,272
So the crew members are basically lying

34
00:01:53,272 --> 00:01:55,896
on the back of their seat 
with their feet up.

35
00:01:55,896 --> 00:01:59,380
This is also the preparation
before launch in the mid deck.

36
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,938
Again, the crew members
are lying on the back of their seats,

37
00:02:03,938 --> 00:02:07,977
and in the front towards their feet

38
00:02:07,977 --> 00:02:10,747
is basically the floor of the mid deck.

39
00:02:11,041 --> 00:02:14,097
And on the top here
is the forward bulkhead

40
00:02:14,097 --> 00:02:16,649
of the mid deck with all the lockers.

41
00:02:17,189 --> 00:02:23,025
And you see that everyone has 
an orange Launch and Entry Suit

42
00:02:23,025 --> 00:02:28,013
and helmet, and there was
a possibility of pressurizing the suit

43
00:02:28,013 --> 00:02:30,310
in case there was any problem
with the cabin pressure

44
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,486
during the ascent.

45
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:34,700
There was a way 
of saving the crew in this way.

46
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:40,533
There was also a possibility
to technically explode the side hatch

47
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:46,391
for rapid escape in case 
there was a launch abort

48
00:02:46,391 --> 00:02:50,709
and the crew had to escape rapidly, 
of course, before liftoff of the orbiter.

49
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:55,060
Then the crew member on the far end

50
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:57,690
was the one responsible 
for exploding the side hatch,

51
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,095
and then the crew members 
had in a given order

52
00:03:01,095 --> 00:03:05,810
to exit the Space Shuttle
and then escape the launchpad.

53
00:03:06,326 --> 00:03:10,625
Here we are going to see a nice video
of the liftoff of the Space Shuttle.

54
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:15,504
More precisely, we'll see just about
the last minute of the countdown

55
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:20,284
prior to start 
of the Space Shuttle main engines,

56
00:03:20,284 --> 00:03:23,677
which is about six seconds before liftoff,
and at the time T-zero,

57
00:03:23,677 --> 00:03:29,464
we have Solid Rocket Booster ignition,
and at the same we had eight bolts

58
00:03:29,464 --> 00:03:35,577
fixing the Solid Rocket Booster
in the bottom of the Solid Rocket Booster

59
00:03:35,577 --> 00:03:39,281
pyrotechnically exploded,
and then the whole assembly

60
00:03:39,281 --> 00:03:46,290
was left free, 
and the thrust being about 1.5 times

61
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,349
the weight of the Space Shuttle,
the whole stack was moving

62
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:51,829
to the vertical.

63
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:56,242
So we'll see the initial liftoff
with shortly after the roll maneuver

64
00:03:56,242 --> 00:04:02,394
in order to come into the proper plane
of the planned orbit

65
00:04:02,394 --> 00:04:06,119
which could be anything 
between about 28.5 degrees,

66
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:09,086
which is a minimum,
the latitude of Kennedy Space Center,

67
00:04:09,086 --> 00:04:13,594
all the way to about 52 degrees
which is the inclination

68
00:04:13,594 --> 00:04:16,014
that we have for the International 
Space Station.

69
00:04:16,014 --> 00:04:19,599
And then you see the ascent 
until Solid Rocket Booster separation

70
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:21,496
in a few seconds later.

71

00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:34,002
<i>for main engine cutoff.</i>

102
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:38,403
Well, the ascent to orbit 
is always a very exciting time

103
00:07:38,403 --> 00:07:40,365
of any space mission.

104
00:07:40,365 --> 00:07:45,611
It's the part of the mission
that you remember forever.

105
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:47,553
Really amazing.

106
00:07:47,553 --> 00:07:50,984
Now, what we saw at the end
of the Shuttle ascent video

107
00:07:50,984 --> 00:07:52,781
was the separation 
of the Solid Rocket Boosters,

108
00:07:52,781 --> 00:07:55,320
which fall down into the ocean.

109
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:57,526
They were recovered for later flights.

110
00:07:57,526 --> 00:08:01,294
Then we continue the ascent to orbit
for 6.5 extra minutes,

111
00:08:01,294 --> 00:08:03,151
for 8.5 total minutes.

112
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:07,878
And at the end of this ascent phase,
in fact the end is not so much ascent.

113
00:08:07,878 --> 00:08:13,125
It's more acceleration to the velocity
of 20,000 km/hour

114
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:16,930
or about Mach 76,
76 the speed of sound.

115
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:23,209
At the end of this ascent segment,
we had acceleration of 3 G,

116
00:08:23,209 --> 00:08:26,595
3 G longitudinal, it was velocity
added to the velocity.

117
00:08:26,663 --> 00:08:31,029
Then, main engine cutoff,
and we went from 3 G to 0 G

118
00:08:31,029 --> 00:08:34,000
within a very short time--
about a second and a half.

119
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,407
And then the 0 G that we had
was what was going to be with us

120
00:08:37,407 --> 00:08:42,618
for the remaining 8 days, 10 days
or 12 or 14 days of the mission.

121
00:08:42,618 --> 00:08:49,279
Really always to be remembered, 
section of the mission, ascent to space.

122
00:08:51,217 --> 00:08:53,508
Main engine cutoff, 
separation of the tank,

123
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:57,468
the tank had 
a very low ballistic coefficient.

124
00:08:57,468 --> 00:09:01,166
We were at about 120 km or so 
in the very high atmosphere,

125
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,614
we can say.

126
00:09:02,614 --> 00:09:06,376
And the tank fell down 
on Earth after about 45 minutes.

127
00:09:06,376 --> 00:09:11,036
The geometry of the ascent 
and the main engine cutoff

128
00:09:11,036 --> 00:09:14,969
was such that the tank
had to fall down in the Pacific Ocean.

129
00:09:14,969 --> 00:09:20,221
The Shuttle orbiter 
with a much larger ballistic coefficient

130
00:09:20,221 --> 00:09:24,575
was continuing its ascent 
to the apogee of the orbit.

131
00:09:24,575 --> 00:09:27,658
In fact, the flight path angle
at main engine cutoff

132
00:09:27,658 --> 00:09:30,638
was slightly positive,
so we're going towards

133
00:09:30,638 --> 00:09:34,646
the apogee of an elliptical orbit
who were on an orbital arc

134
00:09:34,646 --> 00:09:37,182
toward the high point of our orbit.

135
00:09:37,182 --> 00:09:40,458
At the high point,
typically about 300 km

136
00:09:40,473 --> 00:09:43,423
above the Earth's surface,
so well outside of the atmosphere,

137
00:09:43,423 --> 00:09:46,421
we had to give an acceleration boost.

138
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:51,324
It was so-called OMS-2 burn
in order to circularize at that altitude.

139
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,798
And we opened the payload bay doors
shortly afterwards,

140
00:09:54,798 --> 00:09:56,443
and this is the view that we had.

141
00:09:56,443 --> 00:09:57,980
Really, an amazing view.

142
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,013
You see the cargo bay of the Shuttle.

143
00:10:01,013 --> 00:10:04,777
You had here the docking interface
with the International Space Station.

144
00:10:04,777 --> 00:10:07,678
You had the tail of the orbiter
with the vertical stabilizer,

145
00:10:07,678 --> 00:10:09,444
the Earth in the background.

146
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:15,486
This is the robotic arm
on the port side of the fuselage sill.

147
00:10:16,236 --> 00:10:18,207
We get to work pretty rapidly.

148
00:10:18,207 --> 00:10:21,669
In fact, after main engine cutoff,
we have to configure the spaceship

149
00:10:21,669 --> 00:10:25,580
in an orbital configuration
in terms of loading a new software load

150
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,174
for the on orbit phase.

151
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:30,360
And we get to work.

152
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:33,775
The view is fantastic,
but we have a flight plan

153
00:10:33,775 --> 00:10:36,227
with a scheduled activity
for each crew member.

154
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:38,011
We get to work.

155
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:43,459
Most of the activities of the crew members
during the on orbit phase

156
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:46,453
is in the aft part of the flight deck.

157
00:10:46,453 --> 00:10:48,994
Here you see the aft flight deck
with the two windows

158
00:10:48,994 --> 00:10:51,933
giving the visual access
to the payload bay

159
00:10:51,933 --> 00:10:54,547
and two overhead windows,
two large windows

160
00:10:54,547 --> 00:10:58,120
about 60 by 60 cm,
a very good optical quality.

161
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:02,197
So we had really a good view
of either the Earth or the stars above.

162
00:11:02,197 --> 00:11:06,571
And on this picture, 
you have two crew members busy,

163
00:11:06,571 --> 00:11:10,597
the one on the right-hand side
is at the control station

164
00:11:10,597 --> 00:11:12,011
of the robotic arm.

165
00:11:12,011 --> 00:11:15,454
In fact, his right hand
is on the rotation hand controller

166
00:11:15,454 --> 00:11:18,255
for control of the robotic arm
and his left hand

167
00:11:18,255 --> 00:11:22,530
on the translation hand controller
with another crew member watching.
