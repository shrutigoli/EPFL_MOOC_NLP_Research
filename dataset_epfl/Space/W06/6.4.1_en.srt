1
00:00:06,155 --> 00:00:08,392
Let's talk about
the International Space Station,

2
00:00:08,392 --> 00:00:13,690
the agreements about
the collaboration of several nations,

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,367
on the program
of the International Space Station

4
00:00:16,367 --> 00:00:19,121
was signed at the beginning of 1998

5
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:23,904
between the United States,
Russia, Canada, Japan,

6
00:00:23,904 --> 00:00:25,603
and the European Space Agency,

7
00:00:25,603 --> 00:00:29,596
representing the 11 member states of ESA
that contributed to the project,

8
00:00:29,596 --> 00:00:32,828
so 15 contributing nations total.

9
00:00:33,021 --> 00:00:37,216
The idea was really to make available
to all these partners

10
00:00:37,216 --> 00:00:42,084
a world-class laboratory in space
for life science, materials science,

11
00:00:42,084 --> 00:00:45,782
Earth observations, solar physics,
and also technology development,

12
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:50,436
and mainly the development
of techniques and support

13
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:54,179
of long-duration space flight
in the Solar System in the future.

14
00:00:54,946 --> 00:00:57,041
You see the flags
of all the nations involved,

15
00:00:57,041 --> 00:01:01,036
and on the upper-right side,
you see the planned architecture

16
00:01:01,036 --> 00:01:04,682
of the International Space Station,
a very successful program.

17
00:01:05,566 --> 00:01:09,087
In this special video
we talked already about mating

18
00:01:09,087 --> 00:01:12,328
of the first two elements of the Station,

19
00:01:12,328 --> 00:01:16,600
which were the Zarya Russian module

20
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:19,263
together with the Unity node, the Node 1,

21
00:01:19,263 --> 00:01:21,707
which was the first American element,

22
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:27,115
and sometime later,
another module, a Russian module,

23
00:01:27,115 --> 00:01:31,703
the service module Zvezda was added.

24
00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:36,018
About two years after the beginning
of the assembly of the Station,

25
00:01:36,018 --> 00:01:39,697
we had the arrival of the first crew,
and you see here the Soyuz,

26
00:01:39,697 --> 00:01:44,308
which allowed three crew members
to come as the first crew of ISS,

27
00:01:44,308 --> 00:01:49,203
which has been permanently inhabited
from that time on until now.

28
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:54,582
These are the first
brave crew members of ISS:

29
00:01:55,033 --> 00:01:58,444
Sergei Krikalev, from Russia, is here;

30
00:01:58,444 --> 00:02:01,303
Bill Shepherd, and Yuri Gidzenko.

31
00:02:01,303 --> 00:02:03,431
So they were the first occupants of ISS,

32
00:02:03,431 --> 00:02:05,525
and they stayed
for several months on board.

33
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:08,946
The Space Station assembly continued,

34
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:12,346
mainly with the arrival
of the Space Shuttle,

35
00:02:12,346 --> 00:02:16,254
which was bringing crew members
and new elements for the Station.

36
00:02:16,254 --> 00:02:20,344
This is the arrival
of the Unity airlock, US airlock.

37
00:02:20,344 --> 00:02:24,413
It was allowing, from that time on,
to perform space walks

38
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:26,756
in support of the Space Station assembly

39
00:02:26,756 --> 00:02:29,880
from the Unity airlock,
and not from the Shuttle airlock.

40
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:32,705
Well, little by little,
the Station was being assembled.

41
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:36,951
Here we see the arrival
of the first US solar panels, on top.

42
00:02:36,951 --> 00:02:38,300
These are the large solar panels

43
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,941
that eventually were going
to be four in number,

44
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:47,689
and at the end of the large side truss
that will be installed later.

45
00:02:47,689 --> 00:02:50,986
But at that time,
we needed already extra power,

46
00:02:50,986 --> 00:02:53,587
and the power generated
by the solar panels

47
00:02:53,587 --> 00:02:56,127
on the two Russian modules
was not enough,

48
00:02:56,127 --> 00:02:59,842
so there were added solar panels
from the US side.

49
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:03,062
One big challenge, from the construction
and assembly point of view,

50
00:03:03,062 --> 00:03:07,813
was the assembly
of the large truss, the side truss,

51
00:03:07,813 --> 00:03:13,517
along the <i>+Y / -Y</i>
body direction of the Station,

52
00:03:13,946 --> 00:03:17,473
at the end of which were going
to be installed the large solar panels.

53
00:03:17,473 --> 00:03:21,294
And here we see the installation
of one truss segment,

54
00:03:21,294 --> 00:03:24,605
the end truss segment
on the port side, and solar arrays.

55
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:29,707
And in the background, by the way,
you see the Greek islands,

56
00:03:29,707 --> 00:03:32,599
and we are flying
over Turkey at this time.

57
00:03:34,376 --> 00:03:41,115
You can see, on one hand,
the solar arrays, not yet deployed.

58
00:03:41,115 --> 00:03:45,114
You see the Space Station
robotic arm, the SSRMS,

59
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:49,523
Space Station Remote Manipulator System,

60
00:03:49,523 --> 00:03:51,693
operated from inside the Station,

61
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:55,198
and the assembly
of these new elements was done

62
00:03:55,198 --> 00:03:58,785
mainly with robotics, the robotic system.

63
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:02,376
First of all, sometimes
the robotic system of the Shuttle

64
00:04:02,376 --> 00:04:06,388
was handing over to the robot arm
of the Station the new element,

65
00:04:06,388 --> 00:04:08,772
and then this element
was brought to place,

66
00:04:08,772 --> 00:04:10,948
but there was also always space walking

67
00:04:10,948 --> 00:04:13,308
in order to mate the new element.

68
00:04:13,308 --> 00:04:16,176
You see here one space walker,
with his feet,

69
00:04:16,176 --> 00:04:18,519
and there is another one
here, less visible.

70
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:21,266
Again, the Space Station assembly

71
00:04:21,266 --> 00:04:24,626
was really a work
of robotics and space walking.

72
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:29,358
A nice view of the Endeavour
Space Shuttle, on STS-118.

73
00:04:29,828 --> 00:04:32,507
The Shuttle is docked
to the International Space Station

74
00:04:32,507 --> 00:04:35,387
through the so-called PMA,
Pressurized Mating Adaptor,

75
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:39,418
which you see here, and again,
you see the Shuttle robot arm here,

76
00:04:39,418 --> 00:04:43,607
and the Space Station robot arm here,
both delivered by Canada.

77
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:48,440
This is a really nice view
of the Shuttle docked to ISS,

78
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:51,383
a view that is seen from the ISS itself,

79
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:55,199
and you see the open payload bay
of the Shuttle, here.

80
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,699
You have the so-called MPLM,
or Multi-Purpose Logistics Module,

81
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:02,742
provided by Italy, part of the European
contribution to the program.

82
00:05:03,276 --> 00:05:08,413
It was there in order to deliver goods
to the International Space Station.

83
00:05:08,413 --> 00:05:11,333
It was then deployed
using the two robotic arms,

84
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:15,163
and then mated to the Station
so the crew could get the content.

85
00:05:16,299 --> 00:05:20,171
Payload bay door open,
and again, the Shuttle robot arm,

86
00:05:20,171 --> 00:05:21,610
and the Station robot arm, here,

87
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:24,612
both involved in all
of the assembly sequences.

88
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:27,053
Well, we are moving fast
through the years.

89
00:05:27,053 --> 00:05:29,535
I don't want to show
all the steps of the assembly,

90
00:05:29,535 --> 00:05:31,819
but we are getting very close
to the end of the assembly.

91
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:35,050
This is Shuttle Mission 134,

92
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:40,073
the mission before the last
Shuttle mission for station assembly,

93
00:05:40,073 --> 00:05:42,872
and this is a view from below.

94
00:05:42,872 --> 00:05:47,468
We are on the Earth
and looking at the Station from below.

95
00:05:47,468 --> 00:05:50,755
This is the front part of the Station,
the velocity vector is there,

96
00:05:50,755 --> 00:05:54,125
and you see the Shuttle
docked to ISS in the front part,

97
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:59,747
and the USOS, the US segment,
with the Japanese module, Kibo,

98
00:05:59,747 --> 00:06:02,168
and European module Columbus.

99
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:05,477
This is the US lab,
this is the Russian segment,

100
00:06:05,477 --> 00:06:10,239
and the truss I talked about is here,
along the <i>Y</i> body direction,

101
00:06:10,239 --> 00:06:13,334
with the solar arrays at the end,
and these are radiators.

102
00:06:14,109 --> 00:06:18,099
They are used in order to radiate
in space the heat generated

103
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:21,760
by all of the equipment
inside the Station

104
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,825
with an ammonia flow
inside these radiators.

105
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:28,900
This is, again, a nice view
of the front part

106
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:32,974
of the International Space Station,
on STS-134.

107
00:06:33,619 --> 00:06:37,687
This is the US lab, here,
this is the Columbus module,

108
00:06:37,687 --> 00:06:40,974
and what is interesting here is
you see the external equipment

109
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:44,596
of the Columbus module with,
in particular, an experiment

110
00:06:44,596 --> 00:06:48,401
that is monitoring constantly the Sun,
taking solar spectrum,

111
00:06:48,401 --> 00:06:51,399
and measuring the solar constant.

112
00:06:51,399 --> 00:06:54,860
On the port side you have
the Japanese module.

113
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:57,008
We don't see here,
but there is an external platform

114
00:06:57,008 --> 00:06:59,044
attached to the Japanese module,

115
00:06:59,044 --> 00:07:03,323
and, again, both robotic arms
on the upper-left side of the picture.

116
00:07:03,803 --> 00:07:06,690
Okay, we are still on STS-134.

117
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:10,193
This is a nice view of the deployment,
from the payload bay of the Shuttle,

118
00:07:10,193 --> 00:07:12,100
of a very important experiment.

119
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,558
This is the so-called
<i>Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer</i>, or AMS,

120
00:07:16,558 --> 00:07:20,193
which was partly developed
at CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland.

121
00:07:20,613 --> 00:07:25,854
And the idea of this experiment,
or rather this collector of particles

122
00:07:25,854 --> 00:07:31,850
from cosmic rays, is to measure
the composition of cosmic rays,

123
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:35,811
and try to detect antiparticles also,

124
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:39,351
and try to resolve 
some of the questions that we have

125
00:07:39,351 --> 00:07:42,208
about the presence
of dark matter in the universe.

126
00:07:43,803 --> 00:07:46,699
The Space Shuttle
is illuminated by floodlights,

127
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:50,583
and you see the Space Station
robotic arm, the SSRMS,

128
00:07:50,583 --> 00:07:52,981
and this is the AMS,
at the end of the RMS,

129
00:07:52,981 --> 00:07:57,438
before its installation
on the starboard truss of the ISS.

130
00:07:58,179 --> 00:08:02,511
STS-135, end of the assembly,
in July, 2011,

131
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:04,901
and this was also the very last flight
of the Space Shuttle.

132
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:07,634
The idea of NASA was really
to use the Space Shuttle

133
00:08:07,634 --> 00:08:11,593
to complete the assembly of ISS,
and then retire it.

134
00:08:12,349 --> 00:08:14,624
So the Station is fully assembled,

135
00:08:14,624 --> 00:08:17,581
together with a lot of spare parts
that were put on platforms outside,

136
00:08:17,581 --> 00:08:20,380
in order to be sure
that there was equipment

137
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:23,688
to be replaced, possibly in the future,

138
00:08:23,688 --> 00:08:27,314
because the Shuttle was no longer there
to bring new equipment to Station.

139
00:08:28,035 --> 00:08:30,269
This is a nice view of ISS ground track.

140
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:33,629
You see ISS is here,
over the Atlantic Ocean,

141
00:08:33,629 --> 00:08:34,865
and this is the current orbit,

142
00:08:34,865 --> 00:08:38,747
it's going to fly over the north
of Europe pretty soon, at night.

143
00:08:38,747 --> 00:08:41,566
This is the day/night boundary.

144
00:08:41,566 --> 00:08:43,459
And it's interesting, because you see

145
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:47,059
that with this inclination
of the orbit of 51.6 degrees,

146
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:52,188
you fly over most of the inhabited areas
in the Northern Hemisphere,

147
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:53,965
and you fly over, I would say,

148
00:08:53,965 --> 00:08:57,106
all of the inhabited areas
of the Southern Hemisphere,

149
00:08:57,106 --> 00:09:01,213
which include the south tip
of South America, and Australia.

150
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,645
I mentioned before
a life science experiment

151
00:09:03,645 --> 00:09:05,607
done on board the Space Station.

152
00:09:05,607 --> 00:09:08,031
This is a big area of research--

153
00:09:08,031 --> 00:09:12,164
the body exposed to weightlessness,
of course, and the gross changes,

154
00:09:12,164 --> 00:09:14,087
and these changes are carefully measured.

155
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:18,227
Here you have
Russian cosmonaut Padalka

156
00:09:18,227 --> 00:09:22,195
performing an ultrasound exam
on Mike Fincke, a US astronaut.

157
00:09:22,712 --> 00:09:26,210
And there are festive moments
on board the International Space Station.

158
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:29,883
This is the 4th of July, 2009,
Expedition 20,

159
00:09:29,883 --> 00:09:34,208
and we had all of the partners
represented in this crew,

160
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,492
from the US, from Russia,
from Canada, Japan, and Europe.

161
00:09:40,961 --> 00:09:45,434
From left to right,
we have Bob Thirsk, from Canada.

162
00:09:45,434 --> 00:09:51,576
We have, in the background,
just hiding the speed limit of 17,000 mph,

163
00:09:52,611 --> 00:09:56,016
Frank De Winne, from Belgium,
representing the European Space Agency;

164
00:09:56,016 --> 00:09:58,880
then we have Gennady Padalka, from Russia.

165
00:09:59,239 --> 00:10:01,750
We have Koichi Wakata, from Japan;

166
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:04,837
Michael Barratt,
in the lower-right-hand side,

167
00:10:04,837 --> 00:10:08,015
and on top, floating on top of the table,

168
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:10,652
we have Roman Romanenko, from Russia.

169
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,284
Astronauts and cosmonauts
on these expeditions,

170
00:10:13,284 --> 00:10:17,617
that normally stay five to six months
on board the Station,

171
00:10:17,617 --> 00:10:22,319
they have to exercise in order
to keep their muscles in good shape,

172
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:26,802
and also avoid or limit
the loss of bone mass,

173
00:10:26,802 --> 00:10:32,428
and typically, they are scheduled
about two hours of exercise per day.

174
00:10:32,428 --> 00:10:35,710
When I say "day," it's 24 hours
in the flight plan.

175
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:38,652
Of course they go around the Earth
in an hour and a half.

176
00:10:38,652 --> 00:10:41,157
And there are various exercise machines.

177
00:10:41,157 --> 00:10:45,868
Here you see André Kuipers,
a Dutch astronaut

178
00:10:45,868 --> 00:10:47,334
from the European Space Agency,

179
00:10:47,334 --> 00:10:50,742
exercising in the Station in 2012,

180
00:10:50,742 --> 00:10:53,513
when he had a six-month stay
on board the Station.

181
00:10:53,513 --> 00:10:55,511
He's basically on a treadmill,

182
00:10:55,511 --> 00:11:00,255
because this is a good way to exercise
the lower part of the body muscles,

183
00:11:00,255 --> 00:11:03,895
and obviously gravity
has to be replaced somehow,

184
00:11:03,895 --> 00:11:07,601
and you have elastic bands here,
that replace the gravity,

185
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:11,714
that allow you to do treadmilling
and run on board the Station.

186
00:11:12,717 --> 00:11:15,572
This is the crew
on board the Space Station

187
00:11:15,572 --> 00:11:18,746
at the time of recording
of this video, Expedition 46.

188
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:21,727
We are at the end of February, 2016.

189
00:11:22,143 --> 00:11:26,201
And from left to right we have
Tim Kopra from the United States;

190
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:28,773
Sergey Volkov, from Russia;

191
00:11:28,773 --> 00:11:31,966
Yuri Malenchenko, from Russia also;

192
00:11:31,966 --> 00:11:34,026
Mikhail Korniyenko, from Russia;

193
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:36,406
Tim Peake, from the United Kingdom,

194
00:11:36,406 --> 00:11:38,859
representing the European Space Agency;

195
00:11:38,859 --> 00:11:42,455
and Scott Kelly, the Commander,
on the right-hand side.

196
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:44,463
Now on the first of March,

197
00:11:44,463 --> 00:11:49,718
which, again, is only in a few days
from now, we're going to have

198
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:56,167
these three individuals
will come back to Earth,

199
00:11:56,167 --> 00:11:58,390
so then there will be only
three crew members

200
00:11:58,390 --> 00:11:59,792
on board the Station,

201
00:11:59,792 --> 00:12:03,479
but they will be joined by three others
in a few weeks from now.

202
00:12:03,479 --> 00:12:06,321
And out of these three
that I just mentioned,

203
00:12:06,321 --> 00:12:09,115
we have Scott Kelly, here,

204
00:12:09,115 --> 00:12:13,083
and Mikhail Korniyenko, from Russia,

205
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,784
who stayed one full year
on board the Station.

206
00:12:16,298 --> 00:12:21,278
That was a decision between NASA
and the Russian Space Agency, Roscosmos,

207
00:12:21,278 --> 00:12:24,693
to evaluate the effect
on the body and on the mind

208
00:12:24,693 --> 00:12:26,759
of staying a long time on the Station,

209
00:12:26,759 --> 00:12:29,788
this always in view
of a long-duration flight

210
00:12:29,788 --> 00:12:31,298
in the Solar System in the future.

211
00:12:31,298 --> 00:12:34,318
So they'll come back
in a few days from now,

212
00:12:34,318 --> 00:12:38,234
after having spent more than 12 months
on board the Station.
