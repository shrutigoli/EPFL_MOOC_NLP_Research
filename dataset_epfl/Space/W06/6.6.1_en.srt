00:00:07,751 --> 00:00:10,793
Hello, my name is Carol Christian,
I'm an astronomer,

2
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,004
and I work at the Space Telescope
Science Institute.

3
00:00:15,005 --> 00:00:19,019
And we are the Science Center
for the Hubble Space Telescope,

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:23,371
and also the James Webb Telescope,
which will be launched in 2018,

5
00:00:23,372 --> 00:00:26,336
and a couple
of other telescopes after that.

6
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:31,785
Our institution is located
on the Johns Hopkins campus

7
00:00:31,786 --> 00:00:34,953
in Baltimore, Maryland,
and we are funded by NASA

8
00:00:34,954 --> 00:00:37,590
to run the telescope
for the science community.

9
00:00:37,591 --> 00:00:42,871
And I am the Project Scientist
for Outreach for Hubble.

10
00:00:43,326 --> 00:00:46,992
I have done some other jobs
there too at my Institution.

11
00:00:46,993 --> 00:00:50,522
I've been there a while,
but currently I do outreach

12
00:00:50,523 --> 00:00:54,587
for the Hubble Space Telescope,
and I really enjoy doing that.

13
00:00:54,588 --> 00:00:57,198
It's a very exciting
telescope to work with.

14
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:07,645
Hubble Space Telescope was designed
to do astronomical research.

15
00:01:07,967 --> 00:01:11,656
It's somewhat similar
to ground-based telescopes,

16
00:01:11,657 --> 00:01:15,043
and it's complementary
to other space telescopes.

17
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,588
It works in the optical,
the ultraviolet, and the near-infrared.

18
00:01:21,524 --> 00:01:25,518
Its goal is to provide
a facility for scientists

19
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,649
who are doing astronomical research,

20
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,702
and the kind of research they're doing

21
00:01:29,703 --> 00:01:33,583
is to look at, a little bit,
the Solar System.

22
00:01:33,584 --> 00:01:37,568
We have looked at Mars,
and Pluto, and Jupiter.

23
00:01:37,569 --> 00:01:41,009
There's a monitoring program
for solar system objects.

24
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:46,048
We also look at planets
in other star systems, how they form.

25
00:01:46,049 --> 00:01:47,498
How many planets are there?

26
00:01:47,499 --> 00:01:49,850
Are they similar to our Solar System?

27
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:52,258
And then how do those stars form?

28
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,135
How do stars in general form?

29
00:01:54,136 --> 00:01:56,283
What are they made of?

30
00:01:56,868 --> 00:02:01,259
We also look at galaxies,
how galaxies form,

31
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:02,774
how they interact,

32
00:02:02,775 --> 00:02:05,984
and how they trace out
the structure of the universe.

33
00:02:05,985 --> 00:02:08,134
And then we look
at the Universe as a whole.

34
00:02:08,136 --> 00:02:09,461
How is it expanding?

35
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:11,165
How far does it extend?

36
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,074
And what is it made of?

37
00:02:13,075 --> 00:02:16,514
So, for example, there's
the luminous material, which we call it.

38
00:02:16,515 --> 00:02:18,455
That's the stuff we can see.

39
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:21,208
And then there's dark matter
and dark energy.

40
00:02:21,209 --> 00:02:23,534
So in general, the Hubble Space Telescope

41
00:02:23,535 --> 00:02:26,664
is purely for astronomical research

42
00:02:26,665 --> 00:02:30,405
which is designed
by the scientific community.

43
00:02:37,765 --> 00:02:42,097
So at the top level, I would say
we are transforming our speculation,

44
00:02:42,098 --> 00:02:44,408
imagination, and then the hypothesis

45
00:02:44,409 --> 00:02:48,103
about what the nature of our universe is,

46
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:53,679
and we probe that, and turn that
into a realistic picture

47
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,073
of what the Universe is,
using those hypotheses,

48
00:02:58,074 --> 00:03:00,310
and then testing them
and collecting data.

49
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:03,838
And the Hubble Space Telescope
then collects the necessary data,

50
00:03:03,839 --> 00:03:06,824
often complemented by other telescopes,

51
00:03:06,825 --> 00:03:12,058
to get a complete picture of how
all the things in the universe form.

52
00:03:12,445 --> 00:03:16,524
So basically, I'd say,
we're taking imagination

53
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:21,000
and turning it into reality
with the telescope--

54
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:24,420
with regards to the nature
of the universe,

55
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:27,466
what the structure of it is,
what it has in it,

56
00:03:27,467 --> 00:03:30,876
and where it came from,
and where we're going.

57
00:03:38,604 --> 00:03:42,677
So I should mention
that the funding agency

58
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:48,961
is both the European
Space Agency and NASA,

59
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:53,043
so National Aeronautics
Space Administration, in the US,

60
00:03:53,044 --> 00:03:55,980
and also the Canadian Space Agency 
has a part of it.

61
00:03:55,981 --> 00:04:00,807
So the funding then really goes
in partnership to NASA,

62
00:04:00,808 --> 00:04:03,999
so they essentially have the choice

63
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,401
of where the telescope
is going to be pointed.

64
00:04:07,402 --> 00:04:12,890
But in actuality, it's actually
the science community as a whole

65
00:04:12,891 --> 00:04:15,917
that decides 
where the telescope will be pointed.

66
00:04:15,918 --> 00:04:19,666
And the way we do that is every year--
and this just happened

67
00:04:20,512 --> 00:04:25,038
in January of 2016,
and it happens every year--

68
00:04:25,039 --> 00:04:29,117
we put out an announcement:
"Hey, we're ready to accept proposals."

69
00:04:29,118 --> 00:04:32,567
And we have a big description post
for the telescope--

70
00:04:32,568 --> 00:04:36,657
how the instruments work,
what they can look at.

71
00:04:36,658 --> 00:04:39,089
And then people talk about their science,

72
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:42,106
they write up their science,
say what they want to do,

73
00:04:42,107 --> 00:04:43,940
and what instruments they want to use,

74
00:04:43,941 --> 00:04:47,157
and how many instruments they want to use,

75
00:04:47,158 --> 00:04:49,960
and they send those proposals to us.

76
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:55,668
And in general we get about
1,000-1,500 proposals every year,

77
00:04:55,669 --> 00:04:58,909
and they're all award-winning proposals,

78
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:03,098
but we can only accommodate about 1 in 5.

79
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:06,012
So the competition is very, very high.

80
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:08,327
And we have 3,000 orbits.

81
00:05:08,328 --> 00:05:13,355
That means 3,000 times the telescope
goes around the Earth in a year,

82
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:15,460
and can be pointing at things.

83
00:05:15,461 --> 00:05:21,272
So typically, one proposal
will have many authors

84
00:05:21,273 --> 00:05:23,622
and many targets to look at,

85
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,463
and so that's why 
we can't accommodate everybody.

86
00:05:27,464 --> 00:05:31,261
But then what happens
is after we get the proposals,

87
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:34,875
representatives of the science community,

88
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:40,168
from ESA, from the US,
and from around the world,

89
00:05:40,182 --> 00:05:46,872
come to Baltimore and, by category--
galaxies, planets, etc.,

90
00:05:46,873 --> 00:05:52,441
there are panels of scientists
who look at other scientists' proposals.

91
00:05:52,442 --> 00:05:54,600
And we're very careful about conflicts,

92
00:05:54,601 --> 00:05:57,520
so that we don't have somebody
who doesn't like somebody else,

93
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,985
or who's in competition
judging a proposal,

94
00:05:59,986 --> 00:06:02,413
and also people who are best buddies.

95
00:06:02,414 --> 00:06:06,122
We try to make it very objective
by the science community

96
00:06:06,123 --> 00:06:08,506
to choose the observations.

97
00:06:08,507 --> 00:06:12,925
Then, when that happens,
the <i>best of the best</i>

98
00:06:12,926 --> 00:06:15,396
get sent to our director.

99
00:06:15,397 --> 00:06:19,932
He then okays the list,
and then we send it to NASA,

100
00:06:19,933 --> 00:06:23,582
and NASA says, "Great, go ahead,
start scheduling the telescope."

101
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:25,143
So we do this every year,

102
00:06:25,144 --> 00:06:28,123
and it takes months to do this every year.

103
00:06:28,124 --> 00:06:31,463
So during that time,
the telescope is still observing,

104
00:06:31,464 --> 00:06:34,438
and we're still pointing it
everywhere in the sky,

105
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:38,638
but we're also doing
the review process for the next year.

106
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,119
So, in general, the people who decide
who's going to use the telescope

107
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,221
are the science community.

108
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:56,929
I would say that, as far as NASA and ESA,
and the community in general,

109
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,157
Hubble is probably
the most successful space mission.

110
00:07:01,158 --> 00:07:04,165
We have some contenders,
of course: Mars,

111
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:06,510
recently New Horizons going to Pluto.

112
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:11,159
There are very successful missions,
but as far as astronomy in general,

113
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,145
Hubble is very successful.

114
00:07:13,146 --> 00:07:16,778
And as far as the astronomical
community feels,

115
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:21,982
it is <i>the</i> most productive
observatory we've ever had

116
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:24,423
in the history of humankind.

117
00:07:24,424 --> 00:07:28,463
So it is very productive,
it met all of its goals,

118
00:07:28,464 --> 00:07:33,142
and it also contributed to discoveries
of things we never imagined

119
00:07:33,143 --> 00:07:36,859
when the telescope was built--
like dark energy,

120
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,420
probing dark matter, things like that.

121
00:07:39,421 --> 00:07:43,802
But we expected to measure
the expansion of the universe.

122
00:07:43,803 --> 00:07:47,659
We expected to measure galaxies,
and understand how they,

123
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:51,788
and the stars in them, form,
and it's just been spectacular,

124
00:07:51,789 --> 00:07:56,939
because every observation
explains a little more about the universe

125
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:59,120
but poses new questions.

126
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:00,840
So it's not like a checklist

127
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:04,291
we're going, "Yup, we learned that,
yup, we learned that."

128
00:08:04,292 --> 00:08:08,226
Instead, every time we learn something,
we have another puzzle.

129
00:08:08,227 --> 00:08:11,513
So it's very, very successful--
it works beautifully,

130
00:08:11,514 --> 00:08:14,587
it's been in operation for over 25 years,

131
00:08:14,588 --> 00:08:17,587
and it really is a fantastic facility.

132
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,852
Yes, so the Hubble Space Telescope,

133
00:08:26,853 --> 00:08:29,826
because it's in orbit around the Earth,

134
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:36,291
is subjected to a little tiny bit
of atmosphere of the Earth.

135
00:08:36,292 --> 00:08:38,879
Now, there's not much up there, of course,

136
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,746
but there is a little bit, just enough,

137
00:08:40,866 --> 00:08:43,203
and it creates a drag on the telescope.

138
00:08:43,203 --> 00:08:46,824
And the atmosphere actually gets
puffed up, or inflated,

139
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:48,769
by activity from the Sun.

140
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,634
So when there's
a lot of activity on the Sun,

141
00:08:51,635 --> 00:08:54,258
a lot of magnetic fields
and particles being ejected

142
00:08:54,259 --> 00:08:59,046
out in the Solar System,
our atmosphere actually puffs up,

143
00:08:59,047 --> 00:09:04,306
and that causes the drag
on the telescope to increase.

144
00:09:04,307 --> 00:09:08,036
So at some point, Hubble will start--
it already has--

145
00:09:08,037 --> 00:09:10,306
the orbit starts to degrade,

146
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:12,855
and then at some point,
it will degrade a lot.

147
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:16,458
At that point, we will have to go get it.

148
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:19,771
So NASA has plans to go send a robot

149
00:09:19,772 --> 00:09:24,294
to get the telescope and to bring it
back down to Earth,

150
00:09:24,295 --> 00:09:26,349
probably dumping it in the ocean,

151
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:30,392
because nobody wants a huge telescope
to land on their house.

152
00:09:30,393 --> 00:09:32,683
So we have to control the reentry.

153
00:09:32,684 --> 00:09:34,694
That's not going to happen
for a long time.

154
00:09:34,814 --> 00:09:38,445
It may not happen until 2025, or beyond.

155
00:09:38,783 --> 00:09:41,882
But that doesn't mean
astronomers have been idle.

156
00:09:41,883 --> 00:09:44,162
We have been planning--
since it takes so long

157
00:09:44,163 --> 00:09:46,912
to build a space telescope,
we've already been planning

158
00:09:46,913 --> 00:09:51,731
the next telescopes, and one of those
is the James Webb telescope.

159
00:09:51,732 --> 00:09:54,948
Now, it isn't really
a replacement for Hubble.

160
00:09:54,949 --> 00:09:58,928
Hubble really doesn't have a "replacement"
the way we think of it,

161
00:09:58,929 --> 00:10:03,478
but there is the next telescope,
and that telescope will mostly

162
00:10:03,479 --> 00:10:08,854
be observing a little bit in the optical,
but mostly in the infrared.

163
00:10:08,855 --> 00:10:14,189
This is more heat energy, and so
what we're going to try to look at,

164
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,840
our star formation region,
looking through the dust

165
00:10:17,841 --> 00:10:20,192
into the core of star formation regions.

166
00:10:20,193 --> 00:10:24,610
Also, mapping
the unseen parts of galaxies,

167
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:27,995
and then looking far out in the universe

168
00:10:27,996 --> 00:10:30,913
where the light from very distant objects

169
00:10:30,918 --> 00:10:33,956
is redshifted through
the expansion of the universe.

170
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:37,853
So James Webb is going to be probing
different parts of the universe,

171
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:42,992
and different kinds of objects,
to more deeply understand

172
00:10:42,993 --> 00:10:47,080
the phenomenon that we've already
been looking at with Hubble.

173
00:10:47,081 --> 00:10:50,458
Beyond that, astronomers
have big imaginations.

174
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:55,849
We have a survey telescope,
which is about the same size as Hubble,

175
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:59,425
but will have a bigger field,
so it will be much wider

176
00:10:59,426 --> 00:11:02,482
so we can do big samples in the universe,

177
00:11:02,483 --> 00:11:06,413
and then even beyond that,
we'd like to have a large telescope

178
00:11:06,414 --> 00:11:10,204
which we sometimes call
the <i>High-Definition Space Telescope</i>,

179
00:11:10,205 --> 00:11:14,815
but that will be out 2030,
or something like that.

180
00:11:14,816 --> 00:11:16,822
but we have to start planning now--

181
00:11:16,823 --> 00:11:18,324
What are the science questions?

182
00:11:18,325 --> 00:11:22,163
What is the technology we need
in order to answer those questions?

183
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:25,675
And then can we build that technology?
Is it feasible?

184
00:11:25,676 --> 00:11:30,782
So we need a cooperation
between scientists, engineers,

185
00:11:30,783 --> 00:11:33,487
and then of course
people who do the budget,

186
00:11:33,488 --> 00:11:34,780
because sometimes they say,

187
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:36,887
"That sounds great,
but you can't afford it."

188
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:40,046
So there will be a series of telescopes
coming after Hubble,

189
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:43,798
but we believe Hubble will last
until at least 2020,

190
00:11:43,799 --> 00:11:45,376
and we hope beyond.

191
00:11:57,532 --> 00:12:00,001
For people who are interested
in astronomy,

192
00:12:01,368 --> 00:12:04,650
I did a lot of astronomy
reading on my own.

193
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:06,881
I was a physics major,

194
00:12:06,882 --> 00:12:10,905
and I did a lot
of mathematics training, as well.

195
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:13,664
Don't be afraid of it.

196
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,477
Once you get used to it,

197
00:12:16,477 --> 00:12:20,927
it's actually quite fascinating
to do mathematics and also physics.

198
00:12:20,928 --> 00:12:24,772
The other thing is, to get involved
in a more informal way,

199
00:12:24,773 --> 00:12:26,538
you can go to our website.

200
00:12:26,542 --> 00:12:29,571
So there's something called
the <i>HubbleSite</i>,

201
00:12:29,572 --> 00:12:33,858
that's its name, <i>hubblesite.org</i>,

202
00:12:33,859 --> 00:12:36,270
and there are a lot of resources there

203
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:39,805
where you can read about the telescope,
learn about the telescope,

204
00:12:39,806 --> 00:12:44,363
and also learn all the things
that the telescope has been doing.

205
00:12:44,653 --> 00:12:47,473
You can find out about
what's going to be observed

206
00:12:47,474 --> 00:12:49,797
in the future with the telescope.

207
00:12:49,798 --> 00:12:54,807
And we also have a number of social media,
like Facebook and Twitter,

208
00:12:54,808 --> 00:12:57,305
where we put out alerts
about what's happening,

209
00:12:57,306 --> 00:12:58,740
and then once you hear about that,

210
00:12:58,741 --> 00:13:00,847
and you go, "Oh, boy!
I'd like to know more!"

211
00:13:00,848 --> 00:13:03,303
You can go back to <i>HubbleSite</i>
and learn about it.

212
00:13:03,304 --> 00:13:08,671
As well, we have a weekly,
it's <i>usually</i> weekly, Hubble Hangout.

213
00:13:08,672 --> 00:13:13,469
If you do a Google Search
of <i>Hubble Hangout</i>,

214
00:13:13,470 --> 00:13:16,984
you can find it on Google+
or on YouTube.

215
00:13:16,985 --> 00:13:20,666
And in the <i>Hubble Hangout</i>
what we do is we talk to the researchers

216
00:13:20,667 --> 00:13:25,564
who are using Hubble, and we say,
"So, what was your idea?

217
00:13:25,565 --> 00:13:28,805
What did you want to look at?
What are you trying to find out?

218
00:13:28,806 --> 00:13:30,908
What kind of data did you collect?

219
00:13:30,909 --> 00:13:33,866
How did you think of this idea,
and what did you learn?"

220
00:13:33,867 --> 00:13:36,979
And sometimes they're not finished,

221
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,464
so we're always looking forward

222
00:13:38,465 --> 00:13:40,475
to getting them back
on the <i>Hubble Hangout</i>.

223
00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:42,754
But it's usually every week,
on a Thursday,

224
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:46,488
but all of the Hangouts
are archived on YouTube,

225
00:13:46,489 --> 00:13:48,499
and so you can watch them,
and you can pick

226
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:51,229
which subject you think
is the most interesting.

227
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,025
So there are a lot of internet resources.

228
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:57,607
Mostly, I would say, you would want
to pursue mathematics

229
00:13:57,608 --> 00:14:01,951
and branches of science,
and see if you like it--

230
00:14:01,952 --> 00:14:05,784
not just the details,
but do you like the process?

231
00:14:05,785 --> 00:14:09,377
Do you like exploration?
Thinking things up?

232
00:14:09,378 --> 00:14:11,349
Trying to discover new things?

233
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,895
And looking at the universe
in a different way

234
00:14:13,896 --> 00:14:16,061
than you look at it every day.

235
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:18,387
And when you start thinking
about things like that,

236
00:14:18,388 --> 00:14:21,267
then you're doing science,
and you're ready to start thinking

237
00:14:21,268 --> 00:14:23,278
about what kind of science you want to do,

238
00:14:23,398 --> 00:14:25,171
and maybe it will be astronomy.

239
00:14:31,081 --> 00:14:32,454
Oh boy!

240
00:14:34,568 --> 00:14:38,309
You know, they're all really fantastic.

241
00:14:39,077 --> 00:14:42,597
We do a lot on Hubble, and we do some
on the James Webb telescope,

242
00:14:42,598 --> 00:14:44,321
and we hope to do some more on that,

243
00:14:44,441 --> 00:14:47,122
because they're putting the mirrors
in the telescope now,

244
00:14:47,123 --> 00:14:50,165
and so they are building it as we speak.

245
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,900
That's pretty exciting.

246
00:14:51,901 --> 00:14:54,192
We've had some really interesting ones,

247
00:14:54,193 --> 00:15:00,122
on exoplanets-- how other planets
around other stars are formed.

248
00:15:00,123 --> 00:15:04,019
We had a recent one
where there was an observation

249
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:08,383
of a gravitational lens,
and they found a supernova,

250
00:15:08,384 --> 00:15:11,857
and then they predicted
when it would reappear.

251
00:15:11,858 --> 00:15:16,333
And they looked for it all through
November and December of 2015,

252
00:15:16,334 --> 00:15:19,521
and then they found it,
so that was pretty exciting.

253
00:15:19,522 --> 00:15:24,221
So, I don't know, I love it all.
My specialty is star clusters,

254
00:15:24,222 --> 00:15:26,300
but I enjoy talking to the authors

255
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:29,389
about all the different kinds
of research that they do.

256
00:15:39,031 --> 00:15:43,332
So mostly what I do,
as the Outreach Scientist,

257
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,881
is I work with our animators
and visualization experts,

258
00:15:46,882 --> 00:15:51,120
on trying to convey the science results

259
00:15:51,121 --> 00:15:55,788
that the scientists who are using
Hubble Space Telescope have discovered.

260
00:15:55,789 --> 00:16:00,496
So we have images,
and we take those images

261
00:16:00,497 --> 00:16:04,269
and try to show the images in a way

262
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:06,790
where anyone can look at the image

263
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,982
and start to understand what kind
of astrophysics is going on.

264
00:16:09,983 --> 00:16:15,144
Like when you look at a nebula,
and you see filamentary structure;

265
00:16:15,145 --> 00:16:18,501
when you look at a place
where there might be an exoplanet;

266
00:16:18,502 --> 00:16:22,775
when you look at a galaxy,
and understand the dust lanes and the gas,

267
00:16:22,776 --> 00:16:25,202
and how star clusters form in it.

268
00:16:25,203 --> 00:16:28,266
So first of all we're taking the data,
and trying to represent it

269
00:16:28,386 --> 00:16:33,277
so that it's immediately obvious,
or with a little explanation,

270
00:16:33,278 --> 00:16:37,091
what kind of astrophysics
is going on in those places.

271
00:16:37,092 --> 00:16:42,193
Secondly, sometimes we need
to have a visualization

272
00:16:42,194 --> 00:16:45,776
or an artist's conception
of what's going on.

273
00:16:45,777 --> 00:16:49,975
So we have animators
and graphic artists who try to show,

274
00:16:49,976 --> 00:16:52,284
"Well, this is what the image looks like,

275
00:16:52,285 --> 00:16:56,855
but this is what the physics
and astronomy is behind that physics."

276
00:16:56,856 --> 00:17:02,802
And so I help the graphic artists
and visualization folks depict that,

277
00:17:02,803 --> 00:17:06,579
in as realistic a manner as possible.

278
00:17:07,055 --> 00:17:11,554
And then I, myself, I'm working
on a little bit of a different project,

279
00:17:11,555 --> 00:17:13,637
which is not quite visualization,

280
00:17:13,637 --> 00:17:18,672
but in that case what we're doing
is we're taking Hubble images

281
00:17:18,673 --> 00:17:24,397
and we are transforming them
into 3D structures

282
00:17:24,398 --> 00:17:29,112
and printing them on a 3D printer,
which is pretty cool,

283
00:17:29,113 --> 00:17:31,695
but what's even more interesting to me

284
00:17:31,696 --> 00:17:34,060
is that we are putting textures on them

285
00:17:34,061 --> 00:17:39,994
so that we can present them
to the visually-impaired individuals,

286
00:17:39,995 --> 00:17:43,957
and we have a big community
here in Baltimore

287
00:17:43,958 --> 00:17:47,114
that reaches out
to visually-impaired individuals.

288
00:17:47,115 --> 00:17:54,443
And this helps visually-impaired
individuals then "see" our imagery,

289
00:17:54,444 --> 00:17:56,454
because they can't see through their eyes,

290
00:17:56,574 --> 00:17:59,317
but they can "see" through touch,
and so we are trying

291
00:17:59,318 --> 00:18:04,115
to represent and test
our representation of the images

292
00:18:04,116 --> 00:18:06,589
that people who can see can appreciate.

293
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:10,621
We're trying to turn them into
a 3D map of the object

294
00:18:10,622 --> 00:18:13,451
so that people can feel it,
and then understand--

295
00:18:13,452 --> 00:18:16,754
What is a star cluster?
What is a galaxy?

296
00:18:17,209 --> 00:18:19,668
So it's an experimental project,

297
00:18:19,669 --> 00:18:25,118
and I'm learning a lot about
how people perceive the universe,

298
00:18:25,745 --> 00:18:28,751
not only using their eyes,
but using their mind,

299
00:18:28,752 --> 00:18:30,209
and in this case, touch.

300
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,661
So it's a pretty exciting project.

301
00:18:32,662 --> 00:18:35,621
It's an experiment, but it's coming along.

302
00:18:40,526 --> 00:18:42,981
That's what we're trying to achieve.

303
00:18:42,982 --> 00:18:46,573
I must admit, we had a little bit
of a problem with our printer,

304
00:18:46,574 --> 00:18:50,566
but we hope that we will be able
to put a library of the files

305
00:18:50,567 --> 00:18:54,091
out on the internet,
and then anybody can print them.

306
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:56,656
We are using a low-end printer.

307
00:18:56,657 --> 00:19:00,194
We don't want to use
the real high-end fancy printers,

308
00:19:00,195 --> 00:19:03,474
because we want to test
what we're doing

309
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:06,419
with printers that people
will be able to get at home.

310
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,840
So that is our goal.

311
00:19:07,841 --> 00:19:12,188
I'm hoping over the next year
we can start rolling out the library.

312
00:19:12,189 --> 00:19:14,534
What we want to do is make sure

313
00:19:14,535 --> 00:19:18,809
the representation
is scientifically accurate,

314
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:22,527
but we also want to make sure
that blind people

315
00:19:22,528 --> 00:19:26,604
can actually distinguish
the different features of an image

316
00:19:26,605 --> 00:19:29,084
before we start pushing the files out.

317
00:19:29,085 --> 00:19:32,660
We have a lot of testing to do,
but yes, it is our intention

318
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:35,918
to make all of those files
available to the public.

319
00:19:40,513 --> 00:19:43,537
Well, I became an astronomer--

320
00:19:43,538 --> 00:19:46,057
First, I became a physicist,

321
00:19:46,058 --> 00:19:48,707
because I really liked physics a lot.

322
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:52,201
I really liked understanding
how things work.

323
00:19:52,202 --> 00:19:56,686
And that translated--
Then I started reading about astronomy,

324
00:19:56,687 --> 00:20:02,745
and I realized that physics is really
from the smallest, tiniest atom

325
00:20:02,746 --> 00:20:06,763
and particle that makes up
an atom, to the universe.

326
00:20:06,764 --> 00:20:12,245
And so when trying to choose
within physics, as a discipline,

327
00:20:12,246 --> 00:20:14,680
what I was mostly interested in,

328
00:20:14,681 --> 00:20:18,938
I decided astrophysics
would be really amazing.

329
00:20:19,845 --> 00:20:23,781
I did grow up in a place 
where the night sky was quite beautiful,

330
00:20:23,782 --> 00:20:26,200
and so I was familiar with the night sky,

331
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:30,620
and was always fascinated by it,
but I really hadn't thought

332
00:20:30,621 --> 00:20:35,402
about astronomy as a career
until I went to college.

333
00:20:35,796 --> 00:20:39,890
So then I decided to study astronomy,
and I worked, actually,

334
00:20:39,891 --> 00:20:45,040
at a couple of ground-based
telescopes originally.

335
00:20:45,874 --> 00:20:47,788
And that's where you go to the mountain,

336
00:20:47,908 --> 00:20:50,920
and you use the telescope
to look at the sky.

337
00:20:50,921 --> 00:20:54,667
And we learned amazing things,
and I still love those environments.

338
00:20:54,668 --> 00:20:56,290
I love mountains, anyway,

339
00:20:56,291 --> 00:21:00,621
and so being up in the mountains
at night is just fantastic.

340
00:21:00,622 --> 00:21:04,685
So I had an opportunity
to work on a NASA mission,

341
00:21:04,686 --> 00:21:09,955
which I did, in California.
It was also a satellite.

342
00:21:09,956 --> 00:21:12,971
And I worked there a couple years,
and then I had an opportunity

343
00:21:13,091 --> 00:21:15,234
to come to the Hubble Space Telescope.

344
00:21:15,235 --> 00:21:20,314
And so I was actually
offered the opportunity

345
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:24,660
to do outreach education
and participate in creating

346
00:21:24,661 --> 00:21:27,550
the news from the Hubble Space Telescope,

347
00:21:27,551 --> 00:21:30,814
and so it seemed
like a very exciting thing to do.

348
00:21:30,815 --> 00:21:36,057
So I came to Baltimore,
to work at my Institution in doing that.

349
00:21:37,195 --> 00:21:42,062
Besides sharing the discoveries
and the excitement,

350
00:21:42,063 --> 00:21:47,332
it means that I can learn about,
and I can interact with people

351
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:51,212
doing all kinds of astronomy,
not just my own field.

352
00:21:51,213 --> 00:21:55,966
So I like really learning
about everything that the telescope

353
00:21:55,967 --> 00:21:58,237
and other telescopes were doing.

354
00:21:58,655 --> 00:22:03,368
And on top of that, in addition
to interacting with other scientists,

355
00:22:03,369 --> 00:22:06,949
I learned that it is really
a challenge sometimes

356
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,400
to represent those discoveries,

357
00:22:09,401 --> 00:22:15,149
and let people appreciate
how beautiful the Universe is,

358
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:19,180
and how complex it is,
and how fascinating it is,

359
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:22,428
not just through the imagery,
but actually how the stuff works,

360
00:22:22,429 --> 00:22:24,081
and why it all fits together.

361
00:22:24,082 --> 00:22:27,352
It fits together really well.

362
00:22:27,353 --> 00:22:30,704
And those are hard concepts to translate,

363
00:22:30,705 --> 00:22:34,113
and so I've been very interested
in what kind of technologies

364
00:22:34,114 --> 00:22:38,605
can we use to transmit that information?

365
00:22:38,606 --> 00:22:42,016
So I've worked in radio,
I've worked in <i>Hangouts</i>,

366
00:22:42,017 --> 00:22:46,913
I've worked a little bit in visualization,
a little bit in social media,

367
00:22:46,914 --> 00:22:49,346
and now I'm working
on this 3D-printer project.

368
00:22:49,347 --> 00:22:53,730
So it's all about can technology
help us understand

369
00:22:53,731 --> 00:22:56,162
the universe which we can't touch?
