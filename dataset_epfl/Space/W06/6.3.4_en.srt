1
00:00:04,459 --> 00:00:06,834
Hubble Space Telescope servicing missions

2
00:00:06,835 --> 00:00:12,877
after the deployment
of the orbiting observatory in 1990,

3
00:00:12,878 --> 00:00:14,267
on mission 31

4
00:00:14,268 --> 00:00:17,517
there was a total
of five servicing missions,

5
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:21,087
SM1, SM2, SM3A, SM3B and SM4,

6
00:00:21,088 --> 00:00:22,857
until May 2009,

7
00:00:22,858 --> 00:00:25,707
shortly before the shuttle was retired,

8
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:29,407
and, of course, from the time
the Shuttle is no longer in operation

9
00:00:29,408 --> 00:00:32,158
it's not possible anymore
to go and visit Hubble.

10
00:00:33,308 --> 00:00:37,737
All these servicing missions
served the purpose of repairing

11
00:00:37,738 --> 00:00:40,187
or improving the telescope

12
00:00:40,188 --> 00:00:43,307
and mainly, it was
the exchange of components;

13
00:00:43,308 --> 00:00:48,787
the telescope had been designed
in order to allow exchange of components.

14
00:00:48,788 --> 00:00:51,807
Some components
were not planned this way,

15
00:00:51,808 --> 00:00:54,787
so we had a little bit
of a harder time exchanging them,

16
00:00:54,788 --> 00:00:58,787
but most of the components
had captive bolts,

17
00:00:58,788 --> 00:01:01,997
and it is relatively easy
to remove them and put them back--

18
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:04,187
although obviously, if you work outside,

19
00:01:04,188 --> 00:01:07,187
the space suit
and the zero-gravity environment--

20
00:01:07,188 --> 00:01:08,677
it's never an easy task.

21
00:01:08,678 --> 00:01:12,678
But, again, the telescope was conceived
for servicing on orbit.

22
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:16,328
This is a cutaway of the telescope
so you see what is inside.

23
00:01:16,329 --> 00:01:20,118
This is the so-called optical part,
this is the instrument part here,

24
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:21,689
a bit larger in diameter.

25
00:01:22,067 --> 00:01:23,986
You have the primary mirror here,

26
00:01:23,987 --> 00:01:27,986
2.4 m in size.

27
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:29,867
The secondary mirror is here,

28
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:34,966
and you have the so-called
high gain antennas, two of them,

29
00:01:34,967 --> 00:01:38,567
allowing the commanding
of the telescope via the control room

30
00:01:41,514 --> 00:01:42,913
in Greenbelt, Maryland,

31
00:01:42,914 --> 00:01:46,343
the Hubble Space Telescope Control Center.

32
00:01:46,344 --> 00:01:50,343
You have the solar arrays
providing the electrical power

33
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:55,993
for powering all of the equipment
and instrument on board

34
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:59,583
or charging the batteries
for the orbital nights,

35
00:01:59,584 --> 00:02:03,583
and in this section you have
the scientific instrument

36
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:06,834
and most of them are
in so-called axial position,

37
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:10,663
but you have a possibility
of the instrument

38
00:02:10,663 --> 00:02:12,078
in a so-called radial position,

39
00:02:12,078 --> 00:02:16,333
including three fine guidance sensors
and wide-field camera.

40
00:02:16,334 --> 00:02:17,763
So this is Hubble,

41
00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:20,061
and where the intervention
could be done on orbit

42
00:02:20,181 --> 00:02:23,301
was basically in the instrument section,
so this section here.

43
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:29,512
The solar arrays were replaced
a couple of times in the servicing tasks

44
00:02:29,513 --> 00:02:32,332
and there was a possibility
of doing interventions

45
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:34,042
on the surface of the telescope--

46
00:02:34,043 --> 00:02:38,042
we added thermal protection
for magnetometers, for instance.

47
00:02:38,043 --> 00:02:41,792
I was one of seven crew members
on the servicing mission one:

48
00:02:41,793 --> 00:02:46,402
the main objective of this mission was
really to install an optical corrector.

49
00:02:46,403 --> 00:02:50,402
We had a problem with the shape
of the primary mirror,

50
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:54,972
so that the pictures obtained
with the telescope

51
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:56,612
were not as sharp as expected

52
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:58,632
so we had to install an optical corrector

53
00:02:58,633 --> 00:03:02,632
and most of the preparation
for this mission

54
00:03:02,633 --> 00:03:06,282
was at the end of 1992,
and for most of 1993,

55
00:03:06,283 --> 00:03:08,962
for a planned launch in December 1993.

56
00:03:08,963 --> 00:03:11,272
And here you see
some of the crew members

57
00:03:11,273 --> 00:03:16,952
including the commander Dick Covey
here and Jeff Hoffman in virtual reality.

58
00:03:16,953 --> 00:03:21,502
As this had never been done before,
we had to use virtual reality to see

59
00:03:21,503 --> 00:03:23,972
what kind of positioning
we're going to have

60
00:03:23,973 --> 00:03:26,522
for the crew members
to perform certain tasks.

61
00:03:26,523 --> 00:03:32,192
I'm here operating in virtual reality
also the robot arm of the Shuttle

62
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:34,085
and this is Ken Bowersox the pilot

63
00:03:34,086 --> 00:03:36,772
and Katie Thornton,
one of the mission specialists.

64
00:03:36,773 --> 00:03:40,772
Beyond virtual reality,
we used, of course, a lot, a pool,

65
00:03:40,773 --> 00:03:43,842
to Marshall Space Flight Center
in Huntsville, Alabama.

66
00:03:43,843 --> 00:03:50,652
You see in the lower left
the installation in this training facility

67
00:03:50,653 --> 00:03:54,652
of the new wide-field
and Planetary Camera number two

68
00:03:54,653 --> 00:03:56,732
that was going to replace
the one existing

69
00:03:56,733 --> 00:03:58,162
that was, of course, affected

70
00:03:58,163 --> 00:04:01,502
by the wrong shape
of the primary mirror.

71
00:04:01,503 --> 00:04:05,802
And we use
really very realistic training tools.

72
00:04:05,803 --> 00:04:09,443
You see there the camera

73
00:04:09,443 --> 00:04:13,083
operated by Jeff Hoffman 
and Story Musgrave in the pool

74
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,162
and the real camera during the mission.

75
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:17,029
You see the similarity between the two,

76
00:04:17,149 --> 00:04:21,101
and the idea was really to have
very high fidelity training tools

77
00:04:21,103 --> 00:04:23,503
in order to avoid surprises on orbit.

78
00:04:23,899 --> 00:04:27,898
The first servicing mission was STS-61;
the 61st Shuttle Mission.

79
00:04:27,899 --> 00:04:30,249
We lifted off from Kennedy Space Center

80
00:04:31,647 --> 00:04:37,727
at 4:26 in the morning,
on the 2nd of December, 1993.

81
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:42,180
Inbound to Hubble--
it took two days, or 48 hours,

82
00:04:42,181 --> 00:04:43,970
to the rendezvous with the telescope,

83
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:47,100
and here we are, close
to the orbiting observatory

84
00:04:47,101 --> 00:04:48,800
and approaching it very slowly.

85
00:04:48,801 --> 00:04:50,189
We are over the Indian Ocean,

86
00:04:50,309 --> 00:04:54,150
and you see the robotic arm
that I had the responsibility for

87
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:57,701
as a robot arm operator
and flight engineer on board,

88
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:04,124
I would say, maybe 10 or 20 minutes
before the capture of the telescope.

89
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:07,417
So the Commander, Dick Covey
with flying the Shuttle,

90
00:05:07,418 --> 00:05:12,710
and coming in a relative orientation
and position versus a telescope

91
00:05:12,711 --> 00:05:14,210
that we had trained for,

92
00:05:14,211 --> 00:05:15,530
and that was adequate

93
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:17,990
for the capture of the telescope
with the robot arm.

94
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:20,470
The capture took place
with the robot arm,

95
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:23,460
and you see the end of the robot arm
here after the capture

96
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:26,210
on one hand and also 
the installation of the telescope,

97
00:05:26,211 --> 00:05:28,870
on a small platform
in the back of the payload bay.

98
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,140
This platform could be rotated

99
00:05:31,141 --> 00:05:35,140
in order to orient towards
the front of the payload bay,

100
00:05:35,141 --> 00:05:40,941
from where we see the telescope here,
through the aft windows of the cockpit;

101
00:05:42,324 --> 00:05:46,323
orient this area of the telescope
where we had to intervene,

102
00:05:46,324 --> 00:05:48,634
so it was quite a practical set up.

103
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:52,303
You see the solar arrays
that don't look great.

104
00:05:52,304 --> 00:05:54,393
In fact, we had a plan to exchange them.

105
00:05:54,394 --> 00:05:57,883
We had new solar arrays
folded in the payload bay,

106
00:05:57,884 --> 00:06:01,603
so in addition to the installation
of the optical corrector,

107
00:06:01,604 --> 00:06:04,264
exchange the solar arrays
was one thing we've got to do

108
00:06:04,264 --> 00:06:08,854
and exchange gyroscopes and do
a few other repair work on the telescope.

109
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:11,920
600 km altitude, that was quite high,

110
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:15,920
that was among the highest missions
of the Space Shuttle,

111
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:19,921
and quite an incredible view
of planet Earth from there.

112
00:06:21,105 --> 00:06:22,964
We performed five spacewalks

113
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:26,544
in order to do the repair work

114
00:06:26,545 --> 00:06:30,544
the servicing that was required.

115
00:06:30,545 --> 00:06:32,184
All these spacewalks

116
00:06:32,185 --> 00:06:36,184
had been extensively practiced
in virtual reality, on one hand,

117
00:06:36,185 --> 00:06:39,944
and then in the training pool
in Huntsville.

118
00:06:39,945 --> 00:06:42,814
And basically the work
on the telescope was done

119
00:06:42,815 --> 00:06:46,485
with a combination of EVA
or space walking and robotics.

120
00:06:46,485 --> 00:06:50,264
You see here from the workstation
of the robotic arm

121
00:06:50,265 --> 00:06:53,474
where I'm operating the arm,

122
00:06:53,475 --> 00:06:55,494
and with my left hand

123
00:06:55,495 --> 00:06:59,314
I'm using the arm translation
hand controller

124
00:06:59,315 --> 00:07:02,002
and with my right hand,
which is not visible here,

125
00:07:02,003 --> 00:07:05,499
I operate the rotation hand controller
of the robot arm.

126
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:08,255
Basically I was placing my colleagues
in a proper position

127
00:07:08,255 --> 00:07:12,504
to do the maintenance work
required on that particular EVA.

128
00:07:12,505 --> 00:07:17,964
So, again, it was determined
that a combination of EVA and robotics

129
00:07:17,965 --> 00:07:20,434
is really the best way
to do such maintenance

130
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:23,258
on a complex scientific instrument
in the space environment.

131
00:07:23,738 --> 00:07:26,826
Space walk, or EVA number 5 out of 5:

132
00:07:26,827 --> 00:07:30,166
we are 600 km over Australia,

133
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:33,709
and you have at the end
of the robot arm Story Musgrave

134
00:07:33,712 --> 00:07:35,544
and Jeff Hoffman at the payload bay,

135
00:07:35,545 --> 00:07:38,844
always two people going
at the same time for spacewalks.

136
00:07:38,845 --> 00:07:46,163
You see that Story Musgrave
has tools here, kind of an open toolbox.

137
00:07:47,984 --> 00:07:50,928
We see here the solar arrays
that have been exchanged,

138
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:54,569
but they are still folded
against the skin of the telescope--

139
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:56,459
later they will be deployed--

140
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,219
and on this spacewalk, we went also
to the top of the telescope

141
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:04,460
to put thermal protection
on magnetometers.

142
00:08:05,676 --> 00:08:09,124
This is on the same space walk:
you see the great view

143
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:11,542
that Jeff Hoffman
and Story Musgrave had.

144
00:08:11,546 --> 00:08:15,045
They were brought both of them
together to the top of the telescope,

145
00:08:15,046 --> 00:08:19,045
and this is a view from the top
of the telescope to the payload bay,

146
00:08:19,046 --> 00:08:22,376
so the rest of the crew
was obviously here.

147
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:27,078
Here you have one of the solar arrays
that we brought back.

148
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:29,958
One of them, the old solar array,
we could not fold,

149
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,238
and we had to jettison it
and leave it in space.

150
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:35,398
It came down to Earth pretty rapidly

151
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:38,758
because it has
a very large surface and low mass,

152
00:08:38,759 --> 00:08:42,529
but we could bring back to Earth
only one of the old solar arrays.

153
00:08:43,532 --> 00:08:47,531
We had servicing mission 2 in 1997,

154
00:08:47,532 --> 00:08:50,122
with the exchange
of scientific instruments

155
00:08:50,122 --> 00:08:53,041
and other general work on the telescope.

156
00:08:53,042 --> 00:08:57,471
Then servicing mission 3
was planned for the year 2000,

157
00:08:57,472 --> 00:09:00,651
but eventually, because there were
a lot of tests to be performed,

158
00:09:00,652 --> 00:09:03,871
it was divided into two, SM3A and SM3B.

159
00:09:03,872 --> 00:09:06,451
I was privileged to be assigned to 3A.

160
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:09,611
It was pretty much exactly six years

161
00:09:09,612 --> 00:09:13,611
after the first servicing mission
that I was a part of,

162
00:09:13,612 --> 00:09:17,612
and we lifted off
at the end of December 1999.

163
00:09:19,034 --> 00:09:22,163
We had only
three spacewalks on this mission.

164
00:09:22,164 --> 00:09:23,653
This is the first spacewalk

165
00:09:23,654 --> 00:09:27,653
where we had an exchange
of the gyroscopes

166
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:31,003
or rate measurement units
on the telescope,

167
00:09:31,004 --> 00:09:35,304
and you see the doors have been opened,
and the instrument part of the telescope.

168
00:09:35,751 --> 00:09:37,210
Together with Mike Foale,

169
00:09:37,246 --> 00:09:41,245
who is interviewed
in a "Focus on" in this MOOC,

170
00:09:41,246 --> 00:09:47,155
I went out for the second spacewalk EVA2,
for 8 hours and 10 minutes.

171
00:09:47,156 --> 00:09:50,915
On the left-hand side, you see Mike Foale

172
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:53,785
who is on a platform
at the end of the robot arm,

173
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:59,755
I'm here, in the forefront
as the so-called free-floater:

174
00:09:59,756 --> 00:10:03,755
the free-floater is the one
among the two space walkers

175
00:10:03,756 --> 00:10:06,875
who is responsible for his displacement

176
00:10:06,876 --> 00:10:09,776
without having the privilege
of being on the robot arm.

177
00:10:10,073 --> 00:10:13,512
And you see
the portable life support system here.

178
00:10:13,513 --> 00:10:16,712
A way to identify
a space-walking astronaut

179
00:10:16,713 --> 00:10:20,303
are the signs on his or her legs here:

180
00:10:20,346 --> 00:10:23,195
on the side
of the portable life support system.

181
00:10:23,196 --> 00:10:27,345
I had a little red chevron,
and Mike Foale had the large red bands.

182
00:10:27,346 --> 00:10:29,355
So if somebody
is suddenly floating away,

183
00:10:29,356 --> 00:10:33,815
you know whether it's Mike or Claude
because you don't see always their face,

184
00:10:33,816 --> 00:10:37,076
and you need to have a way
of identifying who that is.

185
00:10:37,243 --> 00:10:40,193
This is the exchange
of the main computer of the Hubble.

186
00:10:40,606 --> 00:10:45,205
The purpose of EVA2 was to change
that main computer on Hubble,

187
00:10:45,206 --> 00:10:48,395
which needed some beef up,

188
00:10:48,396 --> 00:10:51,895
and also we installed
new fine guidance sensors.

189
00:10:51,896 --> 00:10:53,295
At the end of the spacewalk,

190
00:10:53,296 --> 00:10:56,235
I took some pictures here
with a Nikon camera,

191
00:10:56,236 --> 00:11:01,805
and you see on the side here
the open toolbox with power tools

192
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:05,805
and all of the tools, of course,
are secured with a safety tether.

193
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:09,245
By the way, I also have,
if you look again on the left-hand side,

194
00:11:09,246 --> 00:11:11,256
a safety tether here.

195
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,990
We do all of these spacewalks
with safety tethers

196
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,525
except the one that had
been performed in the past

197
00:11:16,645 --> 00:11:18,527
with the man maneuvering unit.

198
00:11:18,528 --> 00:11:20,999
A little later, on the same
spacewalk EVA2,

199
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,149
together with Mike Foale

200
00:11:22,269 --> 00:11:24,353
we exchanged the fine guidance sensor.

201
00:11:24,354 --> 00:11:27,781
We changed position, with Mike Foale
and now at the end of the robot arm

202
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:32,488
and Mike Foale is here
climbing the north face of Hubble,

203
00:11:32,489 --> 00:11:37,378
and joining me as I am installing
a new fine guidance sensor number two.

204
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:41,048
The old one that was defective
has been taken out

205
00:11:41,049 --> 00:11:43,978
and installed temporarily
on the side of the payload bay.

206
00:11:43,979 --> 00:11:47,251
Later we'll put it
in a thermo stabilized container

207
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:49,268
in the payload bay
to bring back to Earth.

208
00:11:49,269 --> 00:11:52,704
We are, again, 600 km over Australia; 
magnificent view.

209
00:11:53,281 --> 00:11:55,225
On Christmas Day, 1999,

210
00:11:55,226 --> 00:11:57,701
after all the repairs
have been completed successfully,

211
00:11:57,701 --> 00:11:59,613
we released Hubble.

212
00:11:59,614 --> 00:12:03,822
It's always a very special view,
to see a telescope

213
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:08,988
that you worked on in training
for several months very intensely

214
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:11,535
and then you do the repair
for only just a few days,

215
00:12:11,536 --> 00:12:12,884
but very intense days,

216
00:12:12,885 --> 00:12:17,799
and then it's all ready to be released
and back into its free orbit

217
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,935
and ready to resume
scientific observation.

218
00:12:20,936 --> 00:12:22,570
On this mission, we had a problem

219
00:12:22,571 --> 00:12:25,129
with the attitude control of the telescope

220
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,809
because of the failed gyros

221
00:12:26,810 --> 00:12:29,324
so we found a telescope
that was not functional,

222
00:12:29,325 --> 00:12:32,467
and when we released it
on Christmas day it was functional again,

223
00:12:32,468 --> 00:12:34,360
so it was a Christmas gift for us

224
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:36,800
to be able to perform this mission,

225
00:12:36,801 --> 00:12:40,826
a Christmas gift for the astronomers
who had again a functioning telescope.

226
00:12:41,373 --> 00:12:43,993
The following one to the mission 3A
that I just described

227
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:45,971
was in March, 2002,

228
00:12:45,972 --> 00:12:51,272
and we had new solar arrays
installed, small solar arrays

229
00:12:51,273 --> 00:12:53,632
which were more efficient
than the original ones

230
00:12:53,633 --> 00:12:55,407
and also rigid solar arrays

231
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,180
versus the old ones
which was somewhat flexible.

232
00:12:58,717 --> 00:13:02,708
There was a NICMOS cooling
near the infrared camera,

233
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:06,668
and multi-object spectrometer cooling,
and advanced camera for surveys

234
00:13:06,669 --> 00:13:08,566
and reaction wheels.

235
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:12,087
One of them was also exchanged
on servicing missions 3B.

236
00:13:12,409 --> 00:13:14,418
Then, the last one is illustrated here

237
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,708
servicing mission 4, in May 2009,

238
00:13:16,709 --> 00:13:18,199
the very last visit to Hubble,

239
00:13:18,706 --> 00:13:23,466
where there was 
a whole set of exchanges made,

240
00:13:23,466 --> 00:13:27,235
particularly the batteries,
and the gyroscopes again.

241
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:31,235
There was a new camera installed,
the cosmic origins spectrograph,

242
00:13:31,236 --> 00:13:33,595
a spectrograph rather than a camera.

243
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:38,145
The idea was to do
a servicing of the telescope

244
00:13:38,146 --> 00:13:40,395
to maximize its lifetime.

245
00:13:40,396 --> 00:13:44,396
The idea was to give it
at least a 10-year lifetime, if not more,

246
00:13:44,786 --> 00:13:46,305
because that was the last visit

247
00:13:46,306 --> 00:13:49,455
and we wanted to be able to use
a telescope effectively

248
00:13:49,456 --> 00:13:51,905
for science for as long as possible

249
00:13:51,906 --> 00:13:55,415
because servicing was
no longer a possibility

250
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:57,926
after the retirement
of the Shuttle in 2011.

251
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,122
Bye-bye Hubble!

252
00:14:00,123 --> 00:14:02,072
This is one of the last views of Hubble

253
00:14:02,073 --> 00:14:04,612
after the completion
of the servicing mission 4,

254
00:14:04,613 --> 00:14:06,622
again, in May 2009.

255
00:14:06,623 --> 00:14:08,562
The telescope has just been released

256
00:14:08,563 --> 00:14:13,852
and you can see
in the bottom part of the telescope

257
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,482
the crew installed a docking feature

258
00:14:17,483 --> 00:14:20,293
because when the telescope
is no longer usable,

259
00:14:21,860 --> 00:14:27,360
hopefully about ten years from now,
not less than that, around 2025 or so,

260
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:30,204
it will become a space debris

261
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:34,707
and we don't want to let it
come down to Earth on its own

262
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,377
in a random manner;

263
00:14:36,378 --> 00:14:40,877
we want to go to it with robots
and docking ports

264
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:42,627
and do a controlled deorbit

265
00:14:42,628 --> 00:14:45,137
probably over the Pacific Ocean.

266
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:49,688
Again, hopefully sometime
not earlier than 2025.
