1
00:00:05,462 --> 00:00:08,413
Hello, everyone.
Today we'll talk about human access

2
00:00:08,413 --> 00:00:10,881
to space stations.
Space stations in general,

3
00:00:10,881 --> 00:00:16,538
because we have ISS, obviously,
but we also have Tiangong 1 of China.

4
00:00:16,538 --> 00:00:18,309
We'll mention that at the end.

5
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,562
Since the Shuttle was retired
in the summer of 2011,

6
00:00:22,562 --> 00:00:25,264
the only way to get
to the International Space Station

7
00:00:25,264 --> 00:00:29,551
for astronauts and cosmonauts
is using the Russian Soyuz.

8
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:34,368
And you see here, in Baikonur,
the Soyuz rocket

9
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:37,711
lifting off from the launchpad,
and on top you have

10
00:00:37,711 --> 00:00:40,493
the same name for the capsule,
the Soyuz capsule.

11
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:42,958
By the way, you see
the so-called "escape tower"

12
00:00:42,958 --> 00:00:44,447
on top of the Soyuz capsule,

13
00:00:44,447 --> 00:00:47,032
in case there is
any problem during launch,

14
00:00:47,032 --> 00:00:52,522
for instance, a Soyuz rocket failure
or an explosion,

15
00:00:52,522 --> 00:00:56,339
then there is a possibility for the crew
to trigger an escape.

16
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:58,489
There are some rockets
on this escape tower

17
00:00:58,489 --> 00:01:02,257
that can be fired
and take the Soyuz capsule,

18
00:01:02,257 --> 00:01:04,996
together with the three crew members
on board, to some distance

19
00:01:04,996 --> 00:01:07,150
and then they come down
with parachutes on the ground.

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,186
So there is a very valuable
escape system on Soyuz.

21
00:01:10,837 --> 00:01:13,860
This is a Soyuz capsule
with three crew members on board,

22
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,222
coming in the vicinity
of the International Space Station.

23
00:01:17,222 --> 00:01:22,078
The nominal approach, and docking
of the Soyuz capsule to ISS

24
00:01:22,078 --> 00:01:26,098
is all automatic, and you see here
various sensors and antennas,

25
00:01:26,098 --> 00:01:29,369
and sensors and cameras
that are used

26
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,618
in order to guide and control
the displacement of Soyuz

27
00:01:33,618 --> 00:01:36,239
in the vicinity of its target, ISS.

28
00:01:36,239 --> 00:01:38,296
This is a very nice view of Soyuz

29
00:01:38,296 --> 00:01:41,906
docked to the International Space Station
and flying over the Alps.

30
00:01:42,898 --> 00:01:44,217
This is Soyuz spacecraft--

31
00:01:44,217 --> 00:01:46,985
it says here Soyuz,
by the way, in Cyrillic--

32
00:01:46,985 --> 00:01:50,622
and this is northern Italy,
this is Torino,

33
00:01:50,622 --> 00:01:53,636
this is the Mediterranean Sea,
and these are the Alps

34
00:01:53,636 --> 00:01:56,436
and part of Switzerland,
my home country, here.

35
00:01:57,122 --> 00:02:00,049
Now, on the Russian segment
there are several mating points

36
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:01,584
for the Soyuz and for the Progress.

37
00:02:01,584 --> 00:02:03,146
Progress we'll talk about that later,

38
00:02:03,146 --> 00:02:05,983
this is the cargo version
of the Soyuz capsule,

39
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:08,559
which very much looks like Soyuz itself,

40
00:02:08,559 --> 00:02:12,186
and here you have,
exposed to the nadir

41
00:02:12,186 --> 00:02:15,308
in the docking port towards the Earth,

42
00:02:15,308 --> 00:02:17,999
you have a Soyuz capsule,
and you have a Progress,

43
00:02:17,999 --> 00:02:19,558
and, again, you have the names here--

44
00:02:19,558 --> 00:02:22,580
it says here Progress in Cyrillic,
and Soyuz here.

45
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:25,041
These are cutaway views

46
00:02:25,041 --> 00:02:29,014
of the three segments
of the Soyuz capsule.

47
00:02:29,395 --> 00:02:32,617
If we start from the left here,
you have the so-called <i>orbital module</i>,

48
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:34,201
with the docking interface, here,

49
00:02:34,201 --> 00:02:37,127
and all the sensors
that I mentioned before.

50
00:02:37,347 --> 00:02:39,173
So the orbital module, by definition,

51
00:02:39,173 --> 00:02:42,070
is a module, or volume,
that can be inhabited

52
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:44,792
during the on-orbit phase
of the flight of Soyuz,

53
00:02:44,792 --> 00:02:47,172
which now is relatively short,
typically about six hours--

54
00:02:47,172 --> 00:02:49,437
in the past it was a longer time.

55
00:02:49,789 --> 00:02:52,484
The <i>descent module</i>,

56
00:02:52,484 --> 00:02:54,432
this is also the ascent module
for the crew.

57
00:02:54,432 --> 00:02:58,201
This is where the three crew members
take place for the ascent and the entry.

58
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:02,584
This is the place from where
they control the spacecraft also.

59
00:03:03,025 --> 00:03:06,826
And in the back of Soyuz
you have the so-called

60
00:03:06,826 --> 00:03:10,332
<i>Instrumentation/Propulsion module,</i>
or <i>service module</i>,

61
00:03:10,332 --> 00:03:14,349
with the solar arrays and the tanks
and the propulsion system.

62
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:17,064
The view inside the descent module,

63
00:03:17,064 --> 00:03:19,642
which is also the ascent module
for the crew, obviously,

64
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:23,526
and you have here Tim Peake
from ESA,

65
00:03:23,526 --> 00:03:27,058
a UK astronaut
of the European Space Agency,

66
00:03:27,058 --> 00:03:33,155
sitting on the the left-hand seat,
as a flight engineer for Soyuz,

67
00:03:33,155 --> 00:03:35,903
in the simulator in Moscow.

68
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:38,337
The center seat is occupied
by the commander,

69
00:03:38,337 --> 00:03:44,178
and the right seat by another astronaut,
or cosmonaut, a participant,

70
00:03:44,178 --> 00:03:47,466
but not taking place directly
in the control of Soyuz

71
00:03:47,466 --> 00:03:49,456
for the ascent or the entry.

72
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:51,593
This is a view of the right-hand seat.

73
00:03:51,593 --> 00:03:54,091
You see that there's not
that much room in Soyuz;

74
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:57,772
it's kind of cramped,
but it's a very reliable vehicle

75
00:03:57,772 --> 00:04:03,887
and has served the community
of Space Station partners and users

76
00:04:03,887 --> 00:04:08,650
very well over the past few years,
and it will also in the future.

77
00:04:08,858 --> 00:04:11,040
This is a view
of a space flight participant,

78
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,963
Anousheh Ansari, inside the Soyuz TMA-9,

79
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:18,545
on her expedition to the Space Station
where she stayed about 10 days.

80
00:04:19,388 --> 00:04:24,484
Now, the Soyuz capsule is used
as an ascent vehicle to ISS,

81
00:04:24,484 --> 00:04:26,438
and now it's the only way to get there,

82
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:29,312
and also as a descent vehicle, obviously,

83
00:04:29,312 --> 00:04:31,139
but also as a rescue vehicle.

84
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,289
We always have enough Soyuz's attached

85
00:04:35,289 --> 00:04:37,841
to the International Space Station
that if there's a big problem

86
00:04:37,841 --> 00:04:40,427
we can have all the three,
if there are three,

87
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:43,263
or six crew members,
or more, if needed,

88
00:04:43,263 --> 00:04:47,745
they can be taking a ride back to Earth

89
00:04:47,745 --> 00:04:50,985
in an emergency situation
within a very short time.

90
00:04:50,985 --> 00:04:56,457
Now, of course, for the re-entry
of the descent segments of Soyuz

91
00:04:56,457 --> 00:04:59,809
you have a maneuver,
typically a braking maneuver,

92
00:04:59,809 --> 00:05:02,409
that will initiate the descent,
pretty much like we have

93
00:05:02,409 --> 00:05:04,739
in the Space Shuttle,
the principal is the same.

94
00:05:04,739 --> 00:05:07,688
Of course there is fiery re-entry
in the atmosphere,

95
00:05:07,688 --> 00:05:11,998
the hot spot of the re-entry,
there is a thermal shield,

96
00:05:11,998 --> 00:05:15,406
and eventually there is
a large parachute opening,

97
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:19,180
and for the last portion of the descent,
just before touching down,

98
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,479
in Kazakhstan, typically east
of Baikonur, the launch site,

99
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,912
you have a retrorocket firing
at the last moment

100
00:05:28,912 --> 00:05:32,833
in order to reduce
the shock of the contact

101
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:36,025
of the descent module with the ground.

102
00:05:36,025 --> 00:05:37,650
And this is a touch down.

103
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:40,972
It's pretty rough,
but it's definitely survivable.

104
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:45,770
Now, we always know, more or less,
where Soyuz will land,

105
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:49,213
to within a few kilometers only;
it's quite a precise process,

106
00:05:49,213 --> 00:05:53,669
and there are already
support teams that are ready,

107
00:05:53,669 --> 00:05:58,427
with vehicles and helicopters,
and medical support, if needed.

108
00:05:58,427 --> 00:06:01,221
And here you see the Soyuz,
just arrived, at night,

109
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:04,443
and we have all the teams getting there

110
00:06:04,443 --> 00:06:09,151
to where the three crew members
landed with Soyuz, in Kazakhstan.

111
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:11,559
And you see in the background
all the recovery team.

112
00:06:11,559 --> 00:06:16,020
We always have Russians, obviously,
including doctors and some officials,

113
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,394
and we have people from NASA.

114
00:06:18,394 --> 00:06:23,259
Here, in this particular case,
we have Chris Hadfield from Canada,

115
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:25,145
on the left-hand side, here,

116
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:28,512
so we have some Canadians
also present in the team, here.

117
00:06:28,512 --> 00:06:31,888
So there are always representative
of the nation corresponding

118
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:36,376
to the nationality of the astronauts
present in the Soyuz

119
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:40,943
for this entry, and return
to Earth, in Kazakhstan.

120
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:45,697
Well, the US is preparing now
to provide, also,

121
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:49,008
a way to access
the International Space Station

122
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:52,877
for crew members from US soil,
and we have commercial companies--

123
00:06:52,877 --> 00:06:54,820
right now we have
three commercial companies

124
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:58,111
that have been chosen by NASA
to develop a system

125
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:02,563
to take people up to the Space Station
and back to Earth,

126
00:07:02,563 --> 00:07:04,595
and one of these companies is Space X,

127
00:07:04,595 --> 00:07:07,669
and they've developed the Manned Dragon,

128
00:07:07,669 --> 00:07:11,543
which is a human version
of the Dragon capsule

129
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:14,167
that they've been using
successfully so far

130
00:07:14,167 --> 00:07:16,985
to deliver freight
to the International Space Station

131
00:07:16,985 --> 00:07:19,986
and also return trash to Earth.

132
00:07:20,404 --> 00:07:25,787
And on the upper left you see
the Manned Dragon with a service module.

133
00:07:26,168 --> 00:07:29,495
There was an interesting test
that was done not long ago

134
00:07:30,308 --> 00:07:36,154
where we have an evaluation
of the pad abort system,

135
00:07:36,154 --> 00:07:39,514
pretty much like the escape tower
that I mentioned

136
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:41,960
on top of the Soyuz capsule,

137
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:46,521
but here you have integrated thrusters
on the side of the capsule

138
00:07:46,521 --> 00:07:49,655
that in case there is a problem
with a Falcon-9 rocket

139
00:07:49,655 --> 00:07:53,040
that takes Dragon, or the Manned Dragon

140
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,793
to the International Space Station
or to orbit.

141
00:07:57,036 --> 00:07:59,188
In case there's a problem,
you have a way to escape

142
00:07:59,188 --> 00:08:01,571
with a Manned Dragon,
firing these thrusters,

143
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:05,478
and the test was successfully done
in Florida recently.

144
00:08:06,283 --> 00:08:11,299
Another company developing a way
to take a cruise from US soil

145
00:08:11,299 --> 00:08:13,764
to the International Space Station
and back is Boeing.

146
00:08:13,764 --> 00:08:17,055
That's one of the three
that was selected by NASA.

147
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:21,431
And here you have the CST-100 capsule,
developed by Boeing,

148
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:25,237
that will be able to take about six
to seven crew members to Station.

149
00:08:25,237 --> 00:08:29,515
By the way, this is the same
for the crew Dragon,

150
00:08:29,515 --> 00:08:33,034
also six, up to seven
crew members to Station.

151
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,117
Apart from these two capsule-type vehicles

152
00:08:36,117 --> 00:08:38,339
to take people to Station and back,

153
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:42,483
you have one company,
also selected more recently by NASA,

154
00:08:42,483 --> 00:08:44,964
it's Sierra Nevada Corporation,

155
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:48,659
developing the Dream Chaser,
which is a mini Shuttle

156
00:08:49,123 --> 00:08:54,661
that will be able also,
from 2017 on, maybe 2018,

157
00:08:54,661 --> 00:08:57,225
to take crews to ISS.

158
00:08:57,225 --> 00:09:00,153
You have a view of the Dream Chaser
on the left-hand side

159
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:03,669
where it went through landing tests
pretty much like the ALT,

160
00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:06,029
Approach and Landing Test,
for the Space Shuttle,

161
00:09:06,029 --> 00:09:08,868
not completed yet,
and on the right-hand side

162
00:09:08,868 --> 00:09:14,005
you have a view of the future
where you have the Dream Chaser

163
00:09:14,005 --> 00:09:16,400
docked to the International Space Station

164
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:19,633
through a kind of a service module,
with solar arrays which you see here.

165
00:09:19,633 --> 00:09:23,726
This is the last version that we know of
of the Dream Chaser.

166
00:09:23,998 --> 00:09:25,761
By the way, just as a reminder,

167
00:09:25,761 --> 00:09:30,604
you have the pressurized mating adaptor
here in the front part

168
00:09:30,604 --> 00:09:33,814
of the US segment
of the International Space Station,

169
00:09:33,814 --> 00:09:36,368
the European module here, Columbus,

170
00:09:36,368 --> 00:09:41,261
and the Japanese module, Kibo,
with this external platform, here.

171
00:09:42,198 --> 00:09:45,009
Last but not least,
we have from the Chinese, of course,

172
00:09:45,009 --> 00:09:48,575
the Tiangong 1 Space Station,
their own space station

173
00:09:48,575 --> 00:09:53,319
independently of the partnership of ISS,

174
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:56,694
and they have their own
ascent vehicle and descent vehicle,

175
00:09:56,694 --> 00:09:59,107
this is a Shenzhou, this is Shenzou 10,

176
00:09:59,107 --> 00:10:01,691
the last version, with three modules.

177
00:10:01,691 --> 00:10:04,180
This is the on-orbit module;
this is the descent module,

178
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,829
where the crew takes place
for the ascent and the entry,

179
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:10,609
and this so-called service module
with the solar arrays on both sides.

180
00:10:11,669 --> 00:10:17,515
And on the right-hand side
you have the return to Earth

181
00:10:17,515 --> 00:10:22,810
of the last crew of the Shenzhou 10,
including the second Chinese woman,

182
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:26,178
on the right-hand side,
just in front of the module

183
00:10:26,178 --> 00:10:29,185
after the re-entry
and touch down in China.

184
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:35,482
And this was the last flight
of the Chinese into their Space Station.

185
00:10:35,482 --> 00:10:39,547
They are developing right now
the successor to Tiangong 1,

186
00:10:39,547 --> 00:10:41,727
which will be designated Tiangong 2,

187
00:10:41,727 --> 00:10:45,502
and they developed also
a new vehicle for ascent and re-entry

188
00:10:45,502 --> 00:10:48,401
which will be designated Shenzhou 11.
