Hello everyone, and welcome to unit 6, "Human spaceflight".
Behind me, in the background, you see Baikonur, it's sunrise, a beautiful day, preparation for the launch of a Soyuz rocket a few days from now, with the astronauts and cosmonauts to the International Space Station.
This week, we'll talk about
6.2. the Space Shuttle;
6.3. Space Shuttle selected mission that will be addressed.
6.4. will be ISS, including the access and the supply to the International Space Station, and we prepared some practice quizzes after each video, to make sure that you understand the relevant concepts.
Each section from 6.2 to 6.4 is concluded with a control quiz.
In addition, there is a test at the end of the unit.
To illustrate the unit, we have prepared a focus on space telescopes with the interviews of Carol Christian,
Outreach Project Scientist for the Hubble Space Telescope, and John Mather,
Senior Project Scientist for the James Webb Space Telescope, and Nobel Prize winner in Physics for his work on COBE with George Smoot.
Have fun!
