00:00:05,371 --> 00:00:09,581
Hello everyone, today we'll talk
about the slingshot maneuver

2
00:00:09,608 --> 00:00:12,418
or gravity assist maneuver.

3
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:14,884
The problem is the following.

4
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:17,350
If you want to go far away
in the solar system,

5
00:00:17,445 --> 00:00:21,735
in the outer regions of the solar system
with a spacecraft or with a robot,

6
00:00:21,796 --> 00:00:26,406
you know you have
a certain <i>ΔV</i> capability

7
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,990
from your spacecraft

8
00:00:28,032 --> 00:00:30,122
which depends
on the mass of the spacecraft,

9
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:32,382
the mass of the propellant
and the efficiency

10
00:00:32,382 --> 00:00:33,754
of the propulsion system.

11
00:00:33,754 --> 00:00:37,994
But to go far away,
you need a relatively large <i>V_d,</i>

12
00:00:38,030 --> 00:00:41,420
the departure velocity from
the parking orbit around the Earth,

13
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:46,426
respectively a large <i>V_d ∞</i>,
the hyperbolic excess velocity

14
00:00:46,426 --> 00:00:49,396
at the boundary of the sphere
of influence of the Earth.

15
00:00:49,442 --> 00:00:52,502
But sometimes, you just
don't have that capability.

16
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:57,550
So you need to use another trick
in order to gain energy

17
00:00:57,632 --> 00:01:01,602
in the medium, low or medium regions
of the solar system

18
00:01:01,628 --> 00:01:03,688
so you can get to the outer region.

19
00:01:03,768 --> 00:01:05,718
The idea is the following.

20
00:01:05,777 --> 00:01:09,377
You come with a certain
heliocentric velocity

21
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:11,410
into the vicinity of a planet

22
00:01:11,454 --> 00:01:13,274
and you swing around that planet,

23
00:01:13,304 --> 00:01:17,034
the gravity assist planet
or slingshot planet.

24
00:01:17,046 --> 00:01:20,696
Then, when you exit the sphere
of influence of that planet,

25
00:01:20,787 --> 00:01:25,977
you are going to get an increased value
of your heliocentric velocity,

26
00:01:26,015 --> 00:01:29,325
a different direction also which will
give you enough energy

27
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:31,250
to go further away in the solar system.

28
00:01:31,296 --> 00:01:34,976
Sometimes we can even do
several gravity assist maneuvers.

29
00:01:35,006 --> 00:01:38,147
That was the case 
for the Rosetta spacecraft,

30
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:39,680
the Cassini spacecraft.

31
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:43,470
Here we have an example of New Horizons

32
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,663
that flew past Pluto recently.

33
00:01:48,722 --> 00:01:55,182
It was in July 2015 and it used
one gravity assist from Jupiter.

34
00:01:55,234 --> 00:02:01,204
Jupiter is a very massive planet
and it gave New Horizons enough energy,

35
00:02:01,235 --> 00:02:05,645
respectively enough velocity, to gain
the outer region of the solar system.

36
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:09,014
Well, let's look 
at the gravity assist process,

37
00:02:09,023 --> 00:02:13,013
or the slingshot, and the illustration
on the left-hand side.

38
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:19,427
We are leaving the Earth here with 
a heliocentric velocity <i>V_1</i>.

39
00:02:19,427 --> 00:02:21,803
By the way, all the velocities
we have here

40
00:02:21,803 --> 00:02:25,533
are heliocentric velocities
so they are capital <i>V's</i>.

41
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,180
<i>V_E</i> is the velocity of the Earth,
the circular velocity of the Earth

42
00:02:30,212 --> 00:02:32,332
on orbit around the Sun.

43
00:02:32,364 --> 00:02:36,484
Then we are on this trajectory
towards the gravity assist planet.

44
00:02:36,553 --> 00:02:40,403
And we penetrate inside
the sphere of influence

45
00:02:40,466 --> 00:02:43,916
of the gravity assist planet
with velocity <i>V_2</i>.

46
00:02:43,927 --> 00:02:46,267
The target is really to get there.

47
00:02:46,346 --> 00:02:49,607
The green dot on the left-hand side

48
00:02:49,607 --> 00:02:52,367
is the target planet
in the outer solar system

49
00:02:52,388 --> 00:02:54,758
and the idea is the following.

50
00:02:54,798 --> 00:02:58,078
We get with a capital <i>V_2</i>
inside the sphere of influence

51
00:02:58,088 --> 00:03:00,438
of the gravity assist planet.

52
00:03:00,482 --> 00:03:03,782
And then we come out
of that sphere of influence,

53
00:03:03,814 --> 00:03:05,683
which of course here is not to scale,

54
00:03:05,683 --> 00:03:08,313
but that's for the clarification
of the drawing.

55
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:12,667
We have a velocity <i>V_5,</i>
which, as we see here,

56
00:03:12,788 --> 00:03:17,648
is larger in amplitude on the one hand
and in a different direction than <i>V_2</i>,

57
00:03:17,738 --> 00:03:21,978
the penetration velocity heliocentric
into the sphere of influence

58
00:03:22,017 --> 00:03:23,757
of the gravity assist planet.

59
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:25,869
So we have obviously gained energy,

60
00:03:25,924 --> 00:03:29,474
and the idea is to target
the geometry of the encounter,

61
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:35,973
respectively the flyby of the red planet,
in order to get to the targets.

62
00:03:36,017 --> 00:03:39,437
Now sometimes we have
only one gravity assist

63
00:03:39,437 --> 00:03:41,320
to go out into the solar system,

64
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,130
sometimes we have several;
we'll see examples later.

65
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,884
Well, let's look now
at the slingshot maneuver profile,

66
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:51,672
especially what happens
inside the sphere of influence

67
00:03:51,692 --> 00:03:53,452
of the gravity assist planet.

68
00:03:53,527 --> 00:03:59,177
We saw before that we are at this point,
penetrating the sphere of influence

69
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:01,449
of the gravity assist planet

70
00:04:01,482 --> 00:04:05,332
with a velocity <i>V_2</i>
that's heliocentric.

71
00:04:05,362 --> 00:04:11,802
In order to get the value
of the planetocentric velocity

72
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:16,129
of penetration inside
the sphere of influence of the planet,

73
00:04:16,129 --> 00:04:19,878
we have to subtract <i>V_p</i>
and then we get the <i>v_3</i>

74
00:04:19,925 --> 00:04:26,265
and this is the <i>v_a ∞</i> 

75
00:04:26,302 --> 00:04:30,612
into the sphere of influence
of the gravity assist planet.

76
00:04:30,657 --> 00:04:36,207
Then, as we know, it's exactly like 
the arrival at a planet that we looked at

77
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:40,191
for travel into the solar system

78
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:43,456
from the Earth to any planet
In the solar system.

79
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:48,203
Then we know that we have
a hyperbolic trajectory

80
00:04:48,277 --> 00:04:50,457
inside the sphere of influence
of the planet.

81
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,490
And this is the trajectory,
we come at the closest point

82
00:04:54,556 --> 00:04:56,766
to the gravity assist planet here,

83
00:04:56,837 --> 00:05:00,442
and, of course, the distance
to the gravity assist planet

84
00:05:00,442 --> 00:05:07,242
will depend on the vector value of <i>v_3</i>
or the arrival infinity,

85
00:05:07,264 --> 00:05:11,124
but also on the impact parameter,
we'll come back to that later.

86
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,290
Then we come on the outer branch
of the hyperbola and at this point

87
00:05:15,363 --> 00:05:19,103
we are leaving the sphere of influence
of the gravity assist planet.

88
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:25,176
and the <i>v_4</i> is really
the <i>v_d ∞</i> departure infinity,

89
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,579
the velocity at which we leave
the sphere of influence of the planet,

90
00:05:30,636 --> 00:05:33,296
and that's the planetocentric velocity.

91
00:05:33,343 --> 00:05:38,603
We need to add <i>V_p</i>,
the heliocentric velocity of the planet

92
00:05:38,603 --> 00:05:42,681
to find <i>V_5</i>, which is
the heliocentric velocity

93
00:05:42,686 --> 00:05:46,096
of the probe upon leaving
the sphere of influence

94
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,726
of the gravity assist planet.

95
00:05:47,773 --> 00:05:50,753
And, as we can see here,
this is highlighted here,

96
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:56,908
the <i>V_5</i>, vector <i>V_5</i>, is quite a bit larger
and somewhat different direction than <i>V_2</i>.

97
00:05:56,954 --> 00:06:00,264
That's the advantage that we get
through this process.

98
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:04,554
Let's look at the geometry
of the slingshot maneuver

99
00:06:04,554 --> 00:06:09,704
around that planet,
which looks like it's the planet Mars,

100
00:06:09,778 --> 00:06:12,978
and we are especially interested

101
00:06:13,031 --> 00:06:17,521
in the determination 
of the β angle or δ angle.

102
00:06:17,567 --> 00:06:20,797
So the deviation angle
from the initial direction,

103
00:06:20,845 --> 00:06:24,535
which here is <i>v_a ∞</i>,
pretty much a vertical,

104
00:06:24,547 --> 00:06:27,305
and this is the <i>v</i> departure
from the sphere of influence

105
00:06:27,305 --> 00:06:28,835
with a change in direction.

106
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:33,163
Again, these are all small <i>v's</i>
so they are planetocentric velocities

107
00:06:33,224 --> 00:06:36,754
with respect to the gravity assist planet.

108
00:06:36,785 --> 00:06:40,235
Now the situation is very similar
to the one we encountered

109
00:06:40,327 --> 00:06:46,973
when we looked at arrival to a planet
for interplanetary trajectories,

110
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:54,113
with a hyperbolic trajectory inside
the sphere of influence of the planet.

111
00:06:54,152 --> 00:06:57,812
Let's write down a few parameters here.

112
00:06:57,852 --> 00:07:00,932
This here is equal to <i>r_p</i>.

113
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:06,971
The distance to the center of the
gravity assist planet at the periastris.

114
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:12,260
And this distance here is equal to <i>a</i>.

115
00:07:12,311 --> 00:07:21,641
Now you remember that we have here
the <i>d ∞</i>, the impact parameter.

116
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,690
We have this triangle here.

117
00:07:25,717 --> 00:07:29,247
And by the way,
we also have the value of <i>a</i>, here.

118
00:07:29,264 --> 00:07:31,761
These are all the properties
of the hyperbola.

119
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:39,581
So we have this triangle here
that we can solve

120
00:07:39,611 --> 00:07:42,651
in order to find the value of <i>r_p</i>

121
00:07:42,718 --> 00:07:45,978
and then find the value of δ or β,
the deviation angle.

122
00:07:46,024 --> 00:07:49,804
So you remember that we had
the following situation.

123
00:07:49,895 --> 00:07:54,115
We have <i>a</i> equals µ 

124
00:07:54,367 --> 00:07:59,017
divided by <i>v_a ∞ </i> square

125
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:03,340
This is a consequence
of their conservation of energy,

126
00:08:03,373 --> 00:08:09,073
considering that the sphere of influence
is far away from the planet in question,

127
00:08:09,118 --> 00:08:12,548
and it's nearly infinity
so we had to factor <i>1 / r</i>

128
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:16,868
in the vis-viva equation
that we equaled to zero.

129
00:08:16,908 --> 00:08:23,488
Now what we know is <i>v_a ∞</i>,

130
00:08:23,532 --> 00:08:27,882
this is the velocity of arrival
in the sphere of influence.

131
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:35,761
We know this and we choose <i>d ∞</i>,
the impact parameter here.

132
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:39,528
Now you remember, we saw this previously,

133
00:08:39,614 --> 00:08:46,744
<i>r_p + a</i> equals the square root 
of μ squared

134
00:08:46,777 --> 00:08:52,197
divided by <i>(v_a ∞)^4</i>

135
00:08:52,237 --> 00:08:56,367
<i>plus d ∞ squared.</i>

136
00:08:56,421 --> 00:09:00,511
It's just a resolution of this triangle
that we have here.

137
00:09:00,576 --> 00:09:04,866
Now we can determine
the value of <i>r_p</i> is equal to...

138
00:09:04,943 --> 00:09:09,403
I won't write down the whole expression
but we can determine it.

139
00:09:09,462 --> 00:09:13,452
And then we have the cosine of β

140
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:20,072
is equal to the cosine of half of δ.

141
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:27,921
It's equal to <i>a</i> divided by <i>a + r_p</i>.

142
00:09:27,944 --> 00:09:32,264
And, of course, we know 
the <i>a</i> on the basis of this

143
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:34,744
as we know <i>v_a ∞</i>,

144
00:09:34,955 --> 00:09:39,399
and the <i>r_p</i> we know from this,
knowing <i>v_a ∞</i> on one hand

145
00:09:39,399 --> 00:09:41,109
and <i>d ∞</i> also.

146
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:47,879
So we have a way to determine
the deviation angle δ on this slingshot.

147
00:09:47,894 --> 00:09:50,064
And this is a major parameter.

148
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:54,215
We know that the distance
of this point to the planet

149
00:09:54,215 --> 00:09:56,495
or this point to the planet is the same

150
00:09:56,536 --> 00:10:00,678
because that's a symmetric process
on the hyperbolic arc,

151
00:10:00,678 --> 00:10:03,778
and we can so determine
the value of the deviation angle

152
00:10:03,828 --> 00:10:09,068
as well as the <i>r_p</i>, the closest distance
to the deviation planet.

153
00:10:09,115 --> 00:10:14,655
Well, this is quite an interesting example
of several slingshots

154
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:17,752
that were necessary to bring
the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft

155
00:10:17,828 --> 00:10:22,988
all the way to Saturn, where it still is
and recording very interesting data

156
00:10:23,014 --> 00:10:25,844
on the planet itself
and the system of rings

157
00:10:25,893 --> 00:10:29,343
and the 62+ satellites of Saturn.

158
00:10:29,404 --> 00:10:34,434
We had a launch here in October 1997

159
00:10:34,574 --> 00:10:38,774
and we had a total of four flybys.

160
00:10:38,818 --> 00:10:41,928
We had first a Venus flyby here.

161
00:10:41,963 --> 00:10:46,583
We had a second Venus flyby here,
coming with the red trajectory.

162
00:10:46,621 --> 00:10:49,941
Then we had an Earth flyby at this point

163
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:52,353
and finally a Jupiter flyby here.

164
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:58,292
And each of these flybys gave extra energy
to the trajectory of the spacecraft,

165
00:10:58,341 --> 00:11:01,411
allowing it to go to the target
far away in the solar system,

166
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:03,368
Saturn at this point.

167
00:11:04,554 --> 00:11:09,444
The Rosetta mission,
which is an ESA mission

168
00:11:09,444 --> 00:11:14,594
that has an objective to rendezvous
with comet Churyumov–Gerasimenko,

169
00:11:14,594 --> 00:11:17,708
very far away in the solar system,
and then follow the comet

170
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,630
as it was getting closer to the Sun,
developing a tail,

171
00:11:20,682 --> 00:11:26,032
going through the perihelion of that comet
and then follow it for a while

172
00:11:26,082 --> 00:11:28,592
after passing the perihelion.

173
00:11:28,631 --> 00:11:35,951
The mission departed from Kourou,
French Guiana, with Ariane 5 in 2004,

174
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:38,806
and the journey
was going to take 10 years.

175
00:11:38,835 --> 00:11:43,935
The rendezvous with the comet
was going to be in 2014, which happened,

176
00:11:43,981 --> 00:11:47,991
but the initial energy of the spacecraft
was by far not enough

177
00:11:48,055 --> 00:11:51,695
to reach that faraway region
of the solar system,

178
00:11:51,753 --> 00:11:57,603
and it was necessary to perform 4 flybys
of Rosetta with different planets,

179
00:11:57,635 --> 00:12:02,895
and we'll see the 4th or last flyby
which is a flyby of the Earth.

180
00:12:02,944 --> 00:12:07,644
And at the conclusion of this flyby,
the energy of Rosetta was enough

181
00:12:07,656 --> 00:12:12,926
to reach the target several years later,
in fact it was 5 years later.

182
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,350
Here we see in green
the trajectory of the Rosetta spacecraft,

183
00:12:19,409 --> 00:12:23,999
and the controllers had planned
a flyby to the Earth, which we see here.

184
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:26,799
And now we see a view from Rosetta itself

185
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:30,063
as we are coming
into close proximity to the Earth

186
00:12:30,092 --> 00:12:33,712
to deflect the velocity vector in order
to reach the goal in terms of energy

187
00:12:33,729 --> 00:12:35,869
and go far away in the solar system.

188
00:12:35,894 --> 00:12:39,887
A pretty spectacular path
close to the Earth,

189
00:12:39,897 --> 00:12:44,767
and now we are on the new trajectory
which is again heliocentric, elliptical

190
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:48,510
but with a much larger value of <i>a</i>,
the semi-major axis

191
00:12:48,564 --> 00:12:54,334
and the proper geometry to
rendezvous with the comet 5 years later.
