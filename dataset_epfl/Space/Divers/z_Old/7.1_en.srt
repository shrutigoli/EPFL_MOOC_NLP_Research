Hello everyone, and welcome to unit 7.

2
00:00:08,563 --> 00:00:10,766
The subject is human spaceflight,

3
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:13,757
let's say selected subjects
on human spaceflight,

4
00:00:13,757 --> 00:00:17,014
and the future of space exploration.

5
00:00:17,773 --> 00:00:21,746
This week we'll talk about 7.2,

6
00:00:21,746 --> 00:00:24,551
extravehicular activities or spacewalk;

7
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:29,393
7.3 space robotics 
for Space Shuttle and ISS;

8
00:00:30,178 --> 00:00:33,145
7.4 will be about training

9
00:00:33,145 --> 00:00:36,845
and adaptation to the space environment
and readaptation to Earth,

10
00:00:36,845 --> 00:00:41,683
and 7.6, future of space utilization
and exploration.

11
00:00:42,741 --> 00:00:47,241
We have prepared some practice quizzes
after each video, as usual,

12
00:00:47,241 --> 00:00:50,771
to make sure that you have understood
the relevant concepts.

13
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:56,748
Each section, from 7.2 to 7.6
is concluded again, as usual,

14
00:00:56,748 --> 00:00:58,554
by a control quiz.

15
00:00:58,554 --> 00:01:01,168
In addition, there is a test
at the end of the unit.

16
00:01:02,074 --> 00:01:03,468
To illustrate the unit,

17
00:01:03,468 --> 00:01:07,029
we have prepared 
a focus on suborbital spaceflight

18
00:01:07,029 --> 00:01:09,716
with the interview of Harry van Hulten,

19
00:01:09,716 --> 00:01:13,285
experimental test pilot
for the XCOR Aerospace.

20
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,585
He's a test pilot 
for the Lynx Space Plane.

21
00:01:16,906 --> 00:01:18,231
Have fun!
