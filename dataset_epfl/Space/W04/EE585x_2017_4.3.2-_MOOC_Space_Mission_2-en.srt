1
00:00:05,275 --> 00:00:09,492
Hello, everyone! Today we'll talk
about the slingshot maneuvers

2
00:00:09,692 --> 00:00:13,583
or gravity assist or something we
call flybys

3
00:00:13,783 --> 00:00:17,049
which are maneuvers that allow
to reach the outer region of the

4
00:00:17,249 --> 00:00:20,769
solar system or the inner region
whenever the Delta V capability

5
00:00:20,969 --> 00:00:24,557
of the spacecraft is not sufficient,
to get to this faraway destination

6
00:00:24,757 --> 00:00:27,202
we use this technique.

7
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:31,535
We have the example of new Horizon
the NASA spacecraft that had as the

8
00:00:31,735 --> 00:00:37,071
destination the flyby of Pluto. It was
launched in Jan 2006.

9
00:00:37,271 --> 00:00:42,090
It did the gravity assist maneuver
by Jupiter in February 2007.

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:45,817
And eventually reached Pluto in
2015.

11
00:00:46,017 --> 00:00:49,113
Without that gravity assist by
Jupiter it would not have been

12
00:00:49,313 --> 00:00:52,753
possible to go to this far away
region of the solar system and the flyby

13
00:00:52,953 --> 00:00:54,548
at this dwarf planet Pluto.

14
00:00:54,748 --> 00:00:59,556
Let's look at the overall situation
at the scale of the solar system

15
00:00:59,756 --> 00:01:05,126
the flyby situation we have here,
which is departure point

16
00:01:05,326 --> 00:01:08,900
we have the gravity-assist planet
which could be mass Jupiter

17
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:12,313
is we want to go beyond Jupiter
and we have the target here which

18
00:01:12,513 --> 00:01:15,552
could be Saturn or Pluto in the case
of new Horizons.

19
00:01:15,752 --> 00:01:19,445
Now, all the velocities depicted
here are capitals Vs, so they're

20
00:01:19,645 --> 00:01:24,556
Heliocentric velocities. When I say
Heliocentric, it's with respect to

21
00:01:24,756 --> 00:01:28,806
inertial heliocentric coordinate
system.

22
00:01:29,006 --> 00:01:33,523
We have initially Ve which is the
heliocentric velocity of the Earth

23
00:01:33,723 --> 00:01:37,454
we launch with a spacecraft towards
the gravity-assist planets with a

24
00:01:37,654 --> 00:01:44,818
capital V1, and we get with a
capital V2 - velocity within the

25
00:01:45,018 --> 00:01:48,438
sphere of influence the gravity-assist
planets.

26
00:01:48,638 --> 00:01:53,130
At the exit of the sphere of
influence of the gravity-assist

27
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,044
planets, we are at this point with
velocity V5 and you see here

28
00:01:58,244 --> 00:02:03,049
that V5 in amplitude is larger than
V2, on one hand, and as a different

29
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:09,649
directions so that it will allow to
read this heliocentric orbit after

30
00:02:09,849 --> 00:02:13,223
the gravity-assist maneuver
toward the target.

31
00:02:13,423 --> 00:02:16,597
Let's look at the detail of
the slingshot maneuver profile.

32
00:02:16,797 --> 00:02:21,983
We have here the gravity-assist
planets, we have its heliocentric

33
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:27,144
velocity Vp, so the sun is down in
the spectre.

34
00:02:27,344 --> 00:02:31,305
The arrival of the spacecrafts at
the boundary of the sphere of

35
00:02:31,505 --> 00:02:35,301
influence of the gravity-assist
planet is at this point with the

36
00:02:35,501 --> 00:02:40,872
heliocentric velocity V2. We need
to substract the heliocentric

37
00:02:41,072 --> 00:02:47,094
velocity of the planet to find
V3 which, in fact, is equal to "v"

38
00:02:47,306 --> 00:02:50,848
arrival infinity.

39
00:02:51,048 --> 00:02:54,579
This is the planet centric
velocity of our spacecraft entering

40
00:02:54,779 --> 00:02:58,288
the sphere of influence of the
planet. As we know, it will follow

41
00:02:58,488 --> 00:03:01,727
inside the sphere of influence at
hyperbolic trajectory and will

42
00:03:01,927 --> 00:03:05,882
exit the sphere of influence of the
planet at this point

43
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:12,467
with a planet centric velocity
this V4, which is equal to vd

44
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:17,699
v departure infinity, small "v"
because it's planet centric

45
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:23,204
we need to add to Vd infinity the
value Vp in order to get

46
00:03:23,404 --> 00:03:27,333
heliocentric velocity of this
spacecraft at the exit of this

47
00:03:27,533 --> 00:03:30,977
sphere of influence. And let's look
at this relationship.

48
00:03:31,177 --> 00:03:36,277
On this drawing here we have V2
Heliocentric velocity getting into

49
00:03:36,477 --> 00:03:40,346
the sphere of influence. We have Vp
-the heliocentric velocity of the

50
00:03:40,546 --> 00:03:44,100
planet. V5-the spacecraft
heliocentric velocity

51
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:48,595
exiting the sphere of influence and
we see that the amplitude,

52
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:53,954
on one hand, the direction of V5
has been modified by the

53
00:03:54,154 --> 00:03:58,574
swingby by the planets and the
main thing is that really the V5

54
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:03,296
amplitude is larger than the one of
V2, so we've gained a lot of kinetic

55
00:04:03,496 --> 00:04:04,947
energy.

56
00:04:05,956 --> 00:04:09,989
Let's look at some slingshot
maneuver parameters

57
00:04:10,189 --> 00:04:15,706
We arrive with our spacecraft here,
with the Va infinity,

58
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:19,498
in the sphere of influence of the
planets.

59
00:04:19,698 --> 00:04:23,009
We depart at this point still, at
the boundary of the sphere

60
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:27,919
of influence of the planets. With
the velocity Vd infinity, small "v"

61
00:04:28,119 --> 00:04:31,445
which is the planet centric velocity.

62
00:04:31,645 --> 00:04:36,131
Now, we're interested in the value
of Beta, respectively value of Delta

63
00:04:36,331 --> 00:04:40,219
This deviation angle here, this is
what we are interested in.

64
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:53,344
Is, in fact, equal to 180 degrees
minus Delta or 180°-2Beta.

65
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,853
So, we want to know the value of
Beta.

66
00:04:57,053 --> 00:05:01,468
On the basis of all of the
parameters of the encounter.

67
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:08,393
One important parameter is the
impact parameter, which is D

68
00:05:08,593 --> 00:05:10,661
infinity which we have here.

69
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:15,147
And out of the properties of the
hyperbola that we saw before

70
00:05:15,347 --> 00:05:19,461
we have the other important
parameters here,

71
00:05:19,661 --> 00:05:28,541
we have here "a", and here we have
"rp", the closest decent

72
00:05:28,741 --> 00:05:34,534
to the center of the planet at this
point. Periopsis of the trajectory.

73
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:40,517
Now if you project the center of the
planet to the arrival asymptote,

74
00:05:40,717 --> 00:05:45,363
we get to this point and we know
from the properties of the hyperbola

75
00:05:45,563 --> 00:05:47,911
that we also have "a" here.

76
00:05:49,295 --> 00:05:54,758
What we are interested in again is a
value Beta and let's go through

77
00:05:54,958 --> 00:06:02,003
the steps allowing us to determine
that, we have "a" equal μ, divided

78
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:07,137
by Va infinity square.

79
00:06:07,337 --> 00:06:10,275
So, we know the value of "a",
because we know the value of v

80
00:06:10,475 --> 00:06:13,006
infinity.

81
00:06:14,688 --> 00:06:19,350
We choose the value of Delta in
order to reach our goal, which

82
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:22,298
is certain value of the deviation
angle.

83
00:06:22,498 --> 00:06:26,636
If we look at this triangle,

84
00:06:26,836 --> 00:06:29,331
right angle triangle,

85
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:37,122
we can resolve it and we have
"rp" plus "a" equal to square root

86
00:06:37,322 --> 00:06:43,517
of "μ" square divided by "va"

87
00:06:43,717 --> 00:06:53,476
infinity to the power 4 plus "d"
infinity square.

88
00:06:54,255 --> 00:06:59,040
So, as we have chosen "d" infinity,
we know this value,

89
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,619
we know also this parameter here.

90
00:07:03,819 --> 00:07:10,323
So, knowing "a" we can determine
the value of "rp".

91
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:22,090
Now, the Cos Beta is equal to
"a" divided by "a" plus "rp".

92
00:07:22,290 --> 00:07:27,570
So, we can determine the value of
Beta, knowing "a" and "rp"

93
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:30,783
from here. If we know Beta, then
we know the value of the

94
00:07:30,971 --> 00:07:32,835
deviation angle.

95
00:07:34,123 --> 00:07:37,406
OK, we look at the example of
Cassini-Huygens which had 4

96
00:07:37,606 --> 00:07:39,912
flybys in order to reach Saturn.

97
00:07:40,112 --> 00:07:43,424
We have here the launch,

98
00:07:44,087 --> 00:07:47,379
in October 1997.

99
00:07:47,579 --> 00:07:54,584
Then we are on the green trajectory
until the first Venus flyby

100
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:57,975
at this point in April 1998.

101
00:07:58,175 --> 00:08:04,353
Then we are on the red trajectory,
until the second Venus flyby

102
00:08:04,553 --> 00:08:07,893
in June 1999.

103
00:08:08,093 --> 00:08:13,855
Then at this point we have on the
dark blue trajectory

104
00:08:14,055 --> 00:08:18,342
following the second Venus flyby,
a flyby of the Earth

105
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:22,269
which will give us an increased
energy

106
00:08:22,469 --> 00:08:26,358
of the orbit in order to allow
Jupiter flyby

107
00:08:26,558 --> 00:08:30,908
in December 2004 with the final
destination about 7 years

108
00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:35,687
after launch of Saturn in
July 2004.

109
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:40,469
Now we look at the short video
showing the last flyby out of 4

110
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:42,906
flybys of the spacecraft Rosetta,

111
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:46,421
inbound to a comet of
Churyumov-Gerasimenko.

112
00:08:46,621 --> 00:08:50,391
The spacecraft was launching in 2004
from French Guiana on Ariane 5

113
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:55,010
rockets. And reached its destination
10 years later in 2014.

114
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:58,026
Out of 4 flybys, we'll see the
4th flyby here.

115
00:08:58,226 --> 00:09:01,361
First seen from the top of the
solar system and then from the

116
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:04,780
spacecraft itself, as it got very
close to planet Earth.

117
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:11,266
OK, we see Rozetta in green,
we see it approaching the Earth

118
00:09:11,466 --> 00:09:16,340
and here we have the flyby of the
gravity-assist, this is now seen

119
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:19,934
from Rosetta itself. It will come
very close to the Earth at about

120
00:09:20,134 --> 00:09:22,209
2005 km from Earth.

121
00:09:22,409 --> 00:09:25,538
It is very nice view of approaching
the Earth. Very close.

122
00:09:25,738 --> 00:09:29,608
Wow! The swingby, then we look back
at the Earth, after the flyby is

123
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:33,335
complete. Then, again the energy
gain on this last flyby was

124
00:09:33,535 --> 00:09:38,102
sufficient to move Rosetta to a very
far away destination to Solar system

125
00:09:38,302 --> 00:09:42,266
for meeting with a comet. We see
here the resulting trajectory.
