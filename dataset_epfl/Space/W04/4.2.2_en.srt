1
00:00:05,259 --> 00:00:06,702
Departure from a planet.

2
00:00:06,702 --> 00:00:10,233
So, first of all, I need to give you 
some symbol conventions

3
00:00:10,233 --> 00:00:12,535
for position and velocity.

4
00:00:14,345 --> 00:00:17,899
You have the planet here,
you have the Sun here.

5
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:21,998
The radius vector
from the center of the Sun to the planet

6
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:26,577
is designated <i>R_P</i> vectorial.

7
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:30,614
And for the Spacecraft: 
the <i>S</i> means spacecraft,

8
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:33,961
the radius vector
from the Sun to the spacecraft

9
00:00:33,961 --> 00:00:36,883
is capital <i>R_S</i>.

10
00:00:38,513 --> 00:00:41,142
Now, as far as the position
of this spacecraft

11
00:00:41,142 --> 00:00:46,026
with respect to the planets,
we use small <i>r</i>,

12
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:48,246
<i>S</i> for spacecraft,

13
00:00:48,536 --> 00:00:51,826
so the convention
is, whatever is heliocentric,

14
00:00:51,826 --> 00:00:58,103
whether its position or velocity--
over here, the velocities--

15
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:01,922
we use capital letters
and whatever is planetocentric,

16
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:03,110
you use small letters,

17
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:08,190
whether its for the position <i>r</i> vectorial
or <i>v</i> vectorial, as you can see here.

18
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:10,908
So that's an important convention.

19
00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:14,383
Now following
the content of the last slide,

20
00:01:14,383 --> 00:01:17,170
we have the relationship
between the heliocentric movement

21
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:20,329
of the spacecraft--we have this here--

22
00:01:20,959 --> 00:01:24,087
is equal to the planetocentric motion
of the spacecraft

23
00:01:24,087 --> 00:01:27,562
<i>plus</i> the heliocentric movement
of the planet.

24
00:01:29,552 --> 00:01:31,626
If the spacecraft enters
this sphere of influence

25
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:34,308
in case of the arrival
of the target planet,

26
00:01:34,308 --> 00:01:37,686
then we have
this set of relationships here.

27
00:01:37,686 --> 00:01:40,513
Planetocentric movement of the planet
is equal to the difference

28
00:01:40,513 --> 00:01:43,837
between the heliocentric movement
of the spacecraft and the planets.

29
00:01:44,077 --> 00:01:47,327
And this using the convention
with the small letters and the big letters

30
00:01:47,327 --> 00:01:49,308
as we saw on the previous slide.

31
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:53,447
Departure from the planets.

32
00:01:53,447 --> 00:01:56,621
We always start
our journey to a destination

33
00:01:56,621 --> 00:02:00,814
in the solar system
with a parking orbit of radius,

34
00:02:01,094 --> 00:02:04,526
small <i>r_d</i>, <i>d</i> for departure.

35
00:02:06,116 --> 00:02:07,618
And at some point--

36
00:02:08,358 --> 00:02:12,126
also it has to be pretty determined
to be the right point of this orbit--

37
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:15,301
we increase the velocity,
the orbital velocity,

38
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:19,750
to get to a velocity
which is called the departure velocity,

39
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:21,802
<i>V_d</i>.

40
00:02:22,652 --> 00:02:25,289
And depending on the value of <i>V_d</i>,

41
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:28,466
we're going to come possibly
to an elliptical trajectory

42
00:02:28,466 --> 00:02:32,959
if <i>V_d</i> is less than the escape velocity
for that altitude.

43
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:36,884
As we know the escape velocity
depends on the altitude,

44
00:02:37,154 --> 00:02:39,047
it's about, for the Earth,

45
00:02:39,047 --> 00:02:42,205
11.2 km per second
from the surface of the Earth,

46
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:44,353
but it becomes less and less as you go up.

47
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:48,860
Now, if you have
the departure velocity amplitude equal

48
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:53,612
to the escape velocity for that altitude,
you're going to come on a parabolic orbit.

49
00:02:54,075 --> 00:02:57,495
And if you have <i>V_d</i>
larger than escape velocity,

50
00:02:57,495 --> 00:02:59,820
you come on hyperbolic orbits.

51
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,948
What is interesting on a hyperbolic orbit

52
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:04,830
is that at some point,
at a large distance from the Earth,

53
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:07,979
you come to a certain velocity,
constant velocity,

54
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:11,226
which is called
hyperbolic excess velocity.

55
00:03:11,446 --> 00:03:13,347
In the case of the hyperbolic trajectory,

56
00:03:13,347 --> 00:03:16,799
if the departure velocity
is larger than the escape velocity,

57
00:03:16,799 --> 00:03:19,004
you come to this hyperbola,

58
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:21,713
and when you get close
to the asymptote of the hyperbola,

59
00:03:21,713 --> 00:03:26,074
which is not a very large distance away
from the Earth.

60
00:03:26,944 --> 00:03:32,378
Then, you have a constant velocity
and you're going to keep

61
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,041
that constant velocity
all the way to the infinity.

62
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:37,858
Let's look at reaching
the sphere of influence.

63
00:03:37,858 --> 00:03:43,293
The sphere of influence is really
the place away from the departure planet,

64
00:03:43,293 --> 00:03:45,861
which is the Earth,
for which you have a velocity

65
00:03:45,861 --> 00:03:49,437
across the surface of the sphere
of influence with the velocity,

66
00:03:49,437 --> 00:03:53,099
which is pretty much
the hyperbolic excess velocity,

67
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:55,733
velocity that you will keep
all the way to infinity.

68
00:03:56,613 --> 00:04:00,249
Now, let's look at energy consideration.

69
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:04,666
First of all, we have here, 
the departure planet, which is the Earth,

70
00:04:05,176 --> 00:04:10,141
so here, we have <i>r_d</i>,
the radius of the parking orbit.

71
00:04:10,491 --> 00:04:13,059
This is here, the surface
of the sphere of influence.

72
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:17,034
And at this point, on the parking orbit,

73
00:04:19,494 --> 00:04:26,538
you increase velocity to a value <i>v_d</i>,
small <i>v</i>, because it's planetocentric, <i>v_d</i>.

74
00:04:27,268 --> 00:04:30,967
And you get to come on that arc 
of hyperbolic trajectory

75
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:33,876
that will allow you
to cross the sphere of influence

76
00:04:33,876 --> 00:04:37,089
with the velocity <i>v</i> vectorial <i>d</i><i>_∞.</i>

77
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:39,755
The hyperbolic excess velocity.

78
00:04:39,755 --> 00:04:43,534
Now, let's look at energy consideration.

79
00:04:44,424 --> 00:04:50,230
The energy per unit mass,
which we designate as <i>ε</i>,

80
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:54,190
<i>ε_{d ∞}</i> is equal to

81
00:04:54,630 --> 00:05:00,400
<i>v_d  ∞</i> square over two,

82
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,562
this is the kinetic energy,

83
00:05:03,396 --> 00:05:07,908
<i>- (μ / r)_ ∞</i>

84
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,461
the <i>r</i> being the radius
of the sphere of influence.

85
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,952
Τhis is going to be very small

86
00:05:17,192 --> 00:05:19,107
because the radius
of the sphere of influence

87
00:05:19,107 --> 00:05:23,725
is so large that we are going
to consider that this is zero.

88
00:05:25,305 --> 00:05:28,655
So the energy per unit mass at that point

89
00:05:28,655 --> 00:05:32,651
is just equal to <i>v_d ∞</i> square
divided by two, only the kinetic energy.

90
00:05:33,301 --> 00:05:39,469
Now, let's look at this point here,
when we depart, the energy per unit mass.

91
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:48,399
Let's put <i>d</i> here, index <i>d</i>
equal <i>v_d</i> square divided by two

92
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:52,973
minus <i>μ / r_d</i>,
the potential energy.

93
00:05:55,248 --> 00:05:59,568
Now, it happens that this <i>μ / r_d</i>

94
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:07,324
is equal to <i>v_Erd</i> square
divided by two.

95
00:06:08,138 --> 00:06:13,200
You remember that the escape velocity is
equal to the square root of <i>2 μ / r</i>,

96
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:21,964
so this is it here, now if we put
that energy is conserved, so...

97
00:06:22,816 --> 00:06:29,992
Energy per unit mass <i>ε_{d ∞}</i>
equals energy per unit mass

98
00:06:29,992 --> 00:06:33,258
at the departure
from the parking orbits, so...

99
00:06:35,608 --> 00:06:38,977
considering that this is zero here,

100
00:06:40,187 --> 00:06:45,377
it's going to give us <i>v_d ∞</i> square

101
00:06:48,017 --> 00:06:54,853
divided by two, is equal to <i>v_d</i> square 
divided by two,

102
00:06:54,853 --> 00:07:01,985
minus <i>v_Erd</i> square divided by two.

103
00:07:02,415 --> 00:07:03,583
You multiplied by two

104
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:07,293
and you have an important relationship,
which I'm going to write here:

105
00:07:07,533 --> 00:07:11,503
<i>v_d ∞</i> square

106
00:07:11,883 --> 00:07:14,133
equals <i>v_d</i> square

107
00:07:15,553 --> 00:07:20,730
minus <i>v_Erd</i> square.

108
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:26,949
That's a fundamental relationship

109
00:07:26,949 --> 00:07:28,719
between the departure velocity,

110
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:31,169
or the amplitude
of the departure velocity,

111
00:07:31,836 --> 00:07:34,679
the hyperbolic excess velocity here

112
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:38,889
and the escape velocity
from the initial parking orbit.

113
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:45,517
We'll use this expression quite often,
because if we know the value of <i>v_d ∞</i>,

114
00:07:45,517 --> 00:07:50,847
which we will know if we want to do
a Hohmann transfer from the Earth

115
00:07:50,847 --> 00:07:54,684
in order to reach other planet
or inner planet of the solar system,

116
00:07:54,964 --> 00:07:56,442
we will know the <i>v_d ∞</i>,

117
00:07:56,442 --> 00:08:00,175
we will know also the escape velocity
of the parking orbit,

118
00:08:00,175 --> 00:08:02,971
because we know
the radius of the parking orbit,

119
00:08:03,171 --> 00:08:05,952
so it will allow us
to determine the value of <i>v_d</i>,

120
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,492
or how much we will have

121
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:11,022
to increase the velocity
on the parking orbit

122
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:14,909
in order to get our motion
towards the destination planet.
