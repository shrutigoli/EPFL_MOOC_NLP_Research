1
00:00:06,007 --> 00:00:08,123
Let's look at some
alternative methods

2
00:00:08,123 --> 00:00:11,512
to generate thrust
in a space rocket propulsion system.

3
00:00:12,142 --> 00:00:16,620
We've seen the chemical-based
and solid-propellant rocket,

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,353
and also liquid propellant rocket.

5
00:00:18,353 --> 00:00:23,415
But, there are other ways
of generating thrust respectively

6
00:00:23,415 --> 00:00:28,405
of accelerating gas
in order to, by reaction,

7
00:00:28,405 --> 00:00:32,571
propel the spacecraft
whether it's for a central orbit,

8
00:00:32,571 --> 00:00:36,014
or whether it's for orbital maneuvers
outside of the Earth atmosphere.

9
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:39,943
Now, a principle that was tested
in the '60s and '70s

10
00:00:39,943 --> 00:00:43,067
with some success for a while,
but then for technical reasons,

11
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:46,632
and also safety reasons,
it was abandoned, at least for a while.

12
00:00:46,632 --> 00:00:48,817
It may possibly come back, resurface.

13
00:00:48,817 --> 00:00:51,806
It's the nuclear rocket principle
where you have

14
00:00:51,806 --> 00:00:54,600
a heating of the propellant.

15
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:56,756
In this case, we have hydrogen.

16
00:00:56,756 --> 00:01:00,938
Not by chemical combustion
with an oxidizer and a fuel,

17
00:01:00,938 --> 00:01:04,757
but by heating the propellant
with a nuclear reactor

18
00:01:04,757 --> 00:01:06,697
that you have here,
and there's a control

19
00:01:06,697 --> 00:01:09,839
of the flux of neutrons
with a reflector, as we see here.

20
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:14,187
And what is important
is that you produce a very hot gas

21
00:01:14,187 --> 00:01:16,879
that is expelled through
the nozzle, as we saw before.

22
00:01:17,669 --> 00:01:22,451
It just happens that the velocity
that you can reach

23
00:01:22,451 --> 00:01:24,297
with this system
is quite a bit higher

24
00:01:24,297 --> 00:01:25,631
than with a chemical rocket.

25
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:28,088
Typically, of the order
of 10 kilometers per second,

26
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:32,375
so it's twice the specific impulse,
or twice the efficiency compared

27
00:01:32,375 --> 00:01:35,728
to a liquid fuel rocket engine.

28
00:01:37,128 --> 00:01:40,228
This is a cutaway of a NERVA
nuclear engine

29
00:01:40,228 --> 00:01:42,211
for rocket vehicle application.

30
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:47,041
Again, used in the late '60s and '70s,
but abandoned since that time.

31
00:01:47,901 --> 00:01:53,083
You have the turbopumps
bringing at high-pressure the fuel,

32
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:56,022
or the propellant,
which is hydrogen,

33
00:01:56,832 --> 00:02:00,124
into the reactor itself
with the reflectors,

34
00:02:00,124 --> 00:02:02,946
as we mentioned before,
to control the flux of neutrons.

35
00:02:03,606 --> 00:02:08,059
Now, here we have a representation
of the cooling of the nozzle,

36
00:02:08,059 --> 00:02:11,996
or at least one part of the nozzle,
the initial part of the nozzle,

37
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:15,577
using a propellant line
circulating around the nozzle itself.

38
00:02:15,577 --> 00:02:18,364
We also take some of that
hot gas coming out

39
00:02:18,364 --> 00:02:23,884
of the reactor to feed
the turbopumps

40
00:02:23,884 --> 00:02:27,372
bringing to high-pressure
the propellants,

41
00:02:27,372 --> 00:02:29,188
hydrogen into the reactor.

42
00:02:30,138 --> 00:02:33,097
Now, an alternative method
that has been used widely

43
00:02:33,097 --> 00:02:36,755
in the past few years
is the so-called electric

44
00:02:36,755 --> 00:02:38,449
or ion propulsion system.

45
00:02:38,949 --> 00:02:44,109
The idea is to basically ionize
the propellants

46
00:02:44,109 --> 00:02:47,695
and then accelerate with
the electric field, the propellants,

47
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:50,129
and you can get much higher
velocities than you can

48
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:55,179
with a liquid-fueled or solid propellant
rocket engine.

49
00:02:55,179 --> 00:02:57,778
You see here the propellant injection,

50
00:02:57,778 --> 00:03:02,335
and normally we have either xenon
or argon as a propellant,

51
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:05,305
and it gets into the chamber.

52
00:03:05,305 --> 00:03:09,432
We have a hollow cathode here

53
00:03:10,032 --> 00:03:12,922
that is ejecting electrons,
and it is ionizing

54
00:03:12,922 --> 00:03:15,498
the xenon or argon
to propellants.

55
00:03:15,498 --> 00:03:18,562
Now, inside that chamber,
you have a plasma,

56
00:03:18,562 --> 00:03:21,628
so it's a gas of charged particles.

57
00:03:21,628 --> 00:03:26,137
And you accelerate the ions
in the right part

58
00:03:26,137 --> 00:03:29,632
of the propulsion system,
again, to very high velocities,

59
00:03:29,632 --> 00:03:33,018
quite a bit higher than you obtain
from a chemical propulsion system.

60
00:03:33,608 --> 00:03:37,397
Now, as you get rid of ions here,
to the right,

61
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:40,738
you need to neutralize
because if you don't do that,

62
00:03:40,738 --> 00:03:45,779
you're going to get
quite a highly negative charge

63
00:03:45,779 --> 00:03:49,044
in the thruster itself,
so you need to inject electrons

64
00:03:49,044 --> 00:03:52,872
again, together with the ion beam
in order to keep

65
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:57,710
the propulsion system neutral
so it does not attract, again,

66
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,945
the ions that are ejected
on the right-hand side.

67
00:04:00,605 --> 00:04:05,281
And we get specific impulses
that are typically of the order

68
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:10,143
of 10, of even 100 times higher
than with a chemical engine.

69
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:13,656
Now, the problem with
the ion propulsion system

70
00:04:13,656 --> 00:04:17,008
is that you get very high efficiency
or very high ejection velocity,

71
00:04:17,008 --> 00:04:20,364
but relatively low thrust,
typically of the thrusts

72
00:04:20,364 --> 00:04:23,154
of the order of a fraction
of a newton.

73
00:04:23,154 --> 00:04:27,229
So, it can be used for
propulsion in space.

74
00:04:27,229 --> 00:04:30,020
It cannot be used
for leaving the Earth's surface

75
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:33,572
and to bring a spacecraft
to orbital conditions.

76
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:38,311
It can only specifically be used

77
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:43,295
for a space-to-space
propulsion system, typically.

78
00:04:43,295 --> 00:04:45,720
SMART-1 is a spacecraft
that was launched

79
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,594
by ESA a few years ago
toward the Moon,

80
00:04:48,594 --> 00:04:51,780
and it used the ion propulsion
system from low Earth orbit

81
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:54,605
all the way to the Moon orbit
using very little propellant.

82
00:04:54,605 --> 00:04:59,133
It was able the outer spacecraft
to the Moon orbit.

83
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,432
Now, other example of use
of ion propulsion

84
00:05:01,432 --> 00:05:03,495
has a very bright future,

85
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:06,831
but again, cannot be used
for liftoff from the Earth's surface.

86
00:05:08,071 --> 00:05:10,233
This is an example
of electric propulsion,

87
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:14,056
and it's typically the view
that you have with that blue exhaust,

88
00:05:14,716 --> 00:05:20,509
like a very thin cloud of gas
from the ion propulsion system.

89
00:05:21,609 --> 00:05:26,614
And again, exhaust velocities
stand to 100 kilometers per second.

90
00:05:26,614 --> 00:05:29,649
Of course, significantly
higher than you have

91
00:05:29,649 --> 00:05:32,999
with a chemical propulsion system,
very low thrust values.

92
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:36,964
And this example is
specifically a so-called Hall thruster,

93
00:05:36,964 --> 00:05:40,802
a 6 kilowatts in operation
at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

94
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:44,635
This is variation of the ion engine.

95
00:05:46,485 --> 00:05:50,694
Very bright and talented astronauts
and plasma physicists,

96
00:05:50,694 --> 00:05:54,828
at the same time, Franklin Chang Diaz,
from Costa Rica, but a U.S. citizen,

97
00:05:54,828 --> 00:05:56,971
came with the idea of a so-called

98
00:05:56,971 --> 00:06:00,457
variable specific impulse
magnetoplasma rockets.

99
00:06:00,457 --> 00:06:04,745
It's basically an ion engine
where you can vary the thrust

100
00:06:04,745 --> 00:06:06,147
and the specific impulse.

101
00:06:06,147 --> 00:06:09,080
Whenever you have high thrust,
you have low specific impulse,

102
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,865
but you can have also
very low thrust

103
00:06:10,865 --> 00:06:14,171
and a very high specific impulse,
or very high efficiency.

104
00:06:15,371 --> 00:06:19,776
It uses a lot of the properties

105
00:06:19,776 --> 00:06:23,642
of plasmas and confinement
of plasma in your electromagnetic field.

106
00:06:23,642 --> 00:06:28,028
You have the fuel that is being fed
to the chamber here.

107
00:06:28,028 --> 00:06:31,924
You have a first stage of ionization,
and then a heating

108
00:06:31,924 --> 00:06:34,587
of the plasma to very high temperatures

109
00:06:34,587 --> 00:06:36,971
in the rear part of the rocket engine.

110
00:06:37,771 --> 00:06:41,224
And the energized plasma is ejected,
not in a nozzle,

111
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:44,996
in a physical nozzle, 
but you have a so-called magnetic nozzle

112
00:06:44,996 --> 00:06:48,410
confining the hot gases
that are very high temperature

113
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:50,992
and very high velocity
in the exhaust.

114
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:54,566
Now, you get amazing values
of the I_sp if use it

115
00:06:54,566 --> 00:06:59,111
in the low-thrust mode,
up to 3,000 or 3,000 kilometers

116
00:06:59,111 --> 00:07:03,608
per second ejection velocity,
and corresponding very high I_sp.

117
00:07:03,608 --> 00:07:07,830
The only problem with this engine
is that is requires a lot of energy,

118
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:12,963
so either you use solar panels,
or possibly a nuclear reactor

119
00:07:13,763 --> 00:07:16,390
to generate this high electrical energy.

120
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:20,970
But, it's a big promise
for flights to Mars,

121
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:24,121
possibly a human flight
to Mars in a few decades from now,

122
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:26,225
or hopefully less than that.

123
00:07:26,225 --> 00:07:28,546
And to flight 
in the solar system in general

124
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:31,881
whether for human spacecraft
or a probe or robot sent

125
00:07:31,881 --> 00:07:35,386
to faraway regions
of the solar system.
