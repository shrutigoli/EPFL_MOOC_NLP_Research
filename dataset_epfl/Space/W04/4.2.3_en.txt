Let's look at some more details for the departure from a planet, typically planet Earth, in order to take our spacecraft on an elliptical, heliocentric trajectory around the Sun, with the destination either an outer planet in the Solar System, or an inner planet, like Mercury or Venus.
We have seen this already, we have here the parking orbit around the Earth, we have the radius of the parking orbit, which we put as equal to <i>r_d</i>, d for departure.
At this point, we're going to increase the velocity of our spacecraft on a circular orbit around the Earth, to get to a velocity which is designated <i>v_d</i>.
This will take us on a hyperbolic trajectory such that we will go through the sphere of influence at a non-zero velocity.
We would have practically zero velocity if we had a parabolic trajectory from the parking orbit, but we will have to have a hyperbolic trajectory.
So, we have a non-zero velocity through the sphere of influence, with a velocity of <i>v_d âˆž</i>.
We've seen already the fundamental relationship between the amplitude of <i>v_d</i>, the departure velocity from the parking orbit, and <i>v_d âˆž</i>, the escape velocity at the parking orbit.
We'll write this down again.
<i>v_E</i>, E for escape, for the parking orbit, so, the radius <i>r_d</i>.
So, that's an important relationship that we'll be using several times.
Now, this <i>v_d âˆž,</i> in fact, we very often say just "v d infinity."
Like "vee dee infinity."
Or, the hyperbolic excess velocity.
I'm going to write it down here.
This term seems strange, but the idea is the following: if we had a parabolic trajectory from the parking orbit, we would get to the sphere of influence with basically zero velocity.
So, as we are on a hyperbola, we have a non-zero velocity, and from the crossing of the sphere of influence towards further distances, we'll keep pretty much a constant velocity,
<i>v_d âˆž</i>, and we call it hyperbolic excess velocity.
It's in excess to what we would have if we had a parabolic trajectory.
Now, basically, the sphere of influence, from the point of view of the departure planet, it's like if we were at infinity.
I'm going to write this down, because I think it's important that you understand that.
The sphere of influence equals approximately infinity, for the departure planet.
Which departure planet, of course, is normally the Earth, but it could be another planet, if you go from Mars to another planet, or return to the Earth, then the departure planet would be the planet Mars.
Now, this is not a course on fundamental geometry, but I would like to remind you of some of the features of a hyperbola.
And if you want more detail, you can look at courses in mathematics.
This is relatively elementary geometry, the characteristics of the hyperbola.
Of course, we have the two arcs of the hyperbola, which you see here with the asymptotes.
You have the equation of the hyperbola here, with <i>x</i> and <i>y</i> here.
You have the equations of the asymptotes of the hyperbola.
This is the center of the hyperbola.
Of course, normally we'll consider only one arc of the hyperbola.
Let's take the arc which is on the left-hand side.
This is the center of the hyperbola again.
This is the periapsis, the point of the hyperbola closest to the focus, here.
And <i>c</i>, pretty much like in the case of the ellipse,
<i>c</i> is the distance between the focus and the center of the hyperbola, and <i>a</i> is the distance between the periapsis of the hyperbola and the center of the hyperbola.
There are here some relationships between <i>c</i> and <i>a</i> and <i>b.</i>
And <i>c</i> is equal to <i>a</i>, the semi-major axis, multiplied by the eccentricity.
And in case of the hyperbola, we always have <i>e</i>, the eccentricity, larger than 1.
We know that we have 1 exactly for a parabolic trajectory, and we have less than 1 for an ellipse.
Here we have fundamental relationships, between the velocity on an elliptical trajectory, which is on the top, here, and <i>r,</i> the distance to the central object.
For a given value of <i>a</i>, the semi-major axis of the ellipse, and of course <i>Î¼</i>, the mass of the central object.
We have seen this already before for the ellipse.
This is the so-called
"vis-viva equation."
There are good demonstrations of the vis-viva equation on Wikipedia, the English version, or on several books on orbital mechanics.
It's quite a fundamental relationship.
Now, for the hyperbola.
And again, I'm not going to demonstrate it but you'll find the demonstration in similar references.
It's very similar to the case of the ellipse, except that you have a <i>plus</i> in the case of a hyperbola, versus a minus in the case of the ellipse.
There are important implications of these values of <i>V</i> versus <i>r</i> for the ellipse and the hyperbola, in terms of the total energy per unit mass, and I'm going to write this down on the right-hand side.
Total energy per unit mass.
I'm going to designate this as <i>Îµ</i>.
That's the symbol that we used previously for the ellipse, which we covered already.
So, in the case of the ellipse, of course it's equal to...
V&sup2;/2 - Î¼/r
And if you replace the value of <i>V</i> which I have here by what you have on the left-hand side, with the vis-viva equation, you'll find that this is equal to <i>-Î¼/2a.</i>
This is a very important relationship.
We've seen this already before, although it wasn't demonstrated, because the vis-viva equation was never demonstrated in this course.
It means that the energy per unit mass on an elliptical trajectory is only dependent on, of course, the mass of the central object, <i>Î¼,</i> and on the semi-major axis <i>a,</i> and <i>not</i> on the eccentricity.
If you do the same for the hyperbola, you find that <i>Îµ</i>, energy per unit mass of the hyperbola, and it's plus <i>Î¼/2a</i>.
Again, a fundamental relationship.
A dependence only on the mass of the central object, and the semi-major axis <i>a,</i> but this time, it's always positive.
In the case of the ellipse, it's always negative.
We have the total energy per unit mass equal to 0 in the case of a parabolic trajectory.
In the case of a parabolic trajectory, you have a kinetic energy of 0 at infinity, and you have potential energy 0 at infinity, also, because <i>-Î¼/r</i>.
Let's come back to the departure from a planet.
Initially, we are on the parking orbit, with a radius <i>r_d</i>, d for departure.
And at this point we increase the velocity, which initially was a circular velocity in the parking orbit, to a value corresponding to so-called <i>v_d</i>, which puts us on a hyperbolic arc towards this point on the sphere of influence, where we cross the sphere of influence, with a velocity <i>v_d âˆž</i>.
We've seen that on the previous slide.
Now, the velocity on the hyperbolic arc is equal to <i>âˆš(2Î¼/r)</i> plus that's important, plus, not minus like the case of an ellipse <i>Î¼/a</i>.
Now, at this point, when we cross the sphere of influence, we use the same equation, and we can write here <i>v_d âˆž</i>.
And this first term,
<i>2Î¼/r</i>, is very small, because <i>r</i> is very close to infinity for the departure planet we've said this before.
So, <i>v_d âˆž</i> is about equal to <i>âˆš(Î¼/a).</i>
And that's an important relationship between the <i>v_d âˆž</i>, which is going to be the increase in velocity versus the circular velocity of the Earth around the Sun, in order to come on the elliptical arc towards the destination planet, or Hohmann transfer.
So, we can write this as <i>a=Î¼/(v_d âˆž)^2.</i>
That's going to be an important relationship.
Once we have <i>v_d âˆž</i>, which is what we need to get to the Hohmann transfer to the destination planet, we can find the value of <i>a</i>, which is a fundamental parameter for the departure hyperbola from the Earth.
Now, a few expressions which are useful,
<i>e</i>, the eccentricity, is equal to <i>c/a</i>.
You can see with this triangle here, it's also equal to <i>(a+r_p)/a</i>.
It's always larger than 1, in the case of a hyperbola, as we have already said.
And the departure angle here, <i>Î¸_inf</i>, we can find on the basis of the geometry of this illustration that it's equal to <i>arccos(-1/e)</i>.
So, these expressions allow us to determine the characteristics of the departure hyperbola once we know the value of the <i>v_d âˆž</i>.
