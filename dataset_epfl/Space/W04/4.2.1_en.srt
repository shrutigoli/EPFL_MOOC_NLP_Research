1
00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:09,183
Introduction
to interplanetary trajectories.

2
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:11,241
I would like to start 
with an important definition,

3
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:14,101
the definition of the astronomical unit.

4
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:19,195
It's the average distance 
between the Sun and the Earth

5
00:00:19,713 --> 00:00:23,252
The orbit of the Earth around the Sun 
is slightly elliptical,

6
00:00:23,252 --> 00:00:26,652
with the eccentricity of 0.017.

7
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:32,548
So when the Earth is at its perihelion,

8
00:00:32,548 --> 00:00:35,182
this happens to be in January, 
about the 3rd of January,

9
00:00:35,182 --> 00:00:39,372
it's at about 147,000,000 km to the Sun.

10
00:00:39,392 --> 00:00:43,302
When it's at the aphelion,
the 3rd of July,

11
00:00:44,043 --> 00:00:47,940
it's at 152,000,000 km to the Sun.

12
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,639
And the semi-major axis 
of the elliptical orbit

13
00:00:51,639 --> 00:00:53,569
of the Earth around the Sun

14
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:56,905
is approximately 150,000,000 km

15
00:00:56,905 --> 00:00:59,485
and the exact value 
of the astronomical unit

16
00:00:59,485 --> 00:01:00,985
is depicted here.

17
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:04,487
This is an artist's view 
of the solar system.

18
00:01:04,487 --> 00:01:08,290
You have obviously the Sun 
on the far left,

19
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:10,876
then you have 
the so-called terrestrial planets:

20
00:01:10,876 --> 00:01:13,206
Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,

21
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:15,476
small planets, and hard planets.

22
00:01:15,476 --> 00:01:20,786
Then you have the next four planets, 
which are big gas giants.

23
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:24,669
So very different type of planets 
as you have close to the Sun,

24
00:01:24,692 --> 00:01:28,986
for a grand total of eight planets 
around the Sun.

25
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:33,606
As far as the sizes are concerned, 
Jupiter is about 1/10 the size of the Sun,

26
00:01:33,928 --> 00:01:36,722
and the Earth 
about 1/10 the size of Jupiter,

27
00:01:36,722 --> 00:01:39,642
so the Earth is about 1/100 
of the size of the Sun.

28
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:44,001
Now, you have the so-called dwarf planets,

29
00:01:44,001 --> 00:01:46,805
and Pluto was a planet 
until a few years ago

30
00:01:46,805 --> 00:01:50,418
when it was decided 
that its eccentricity was so large

31
00:01:50,418 --> 00:01:53,015
and the inclination 
of the plane of its orbit

32
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:55,315
with respect to the plane of the ecliptic,

33
00:01:55,325 --> 00:01:57,785
which is the plane of the orbit 
of the Earth around the Sun,

34
00:01:57,792 --> 00:02:00,314
was so large: about 17 degrees

35
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:03,348
that it did not really deserve 
the designation of planet.

36
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:07,486
It was more probably a captured object

37
00:02:07,486 --> 00:02:10,926
way after the formation 
of the solar system

38
00:02:10,926 --> 00:02:14,576
together with the eight planets 
about 4.6 billion years in the past.

39
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:21,495
This is a chart
of the orbital characteristics of planets.

40
00:02:22,982 --> 00:02:26,943
Semi-major axis, obviously 
we have 1.00 for the Earth.

41
00:02:26,943 --> 00:02:32,984
This is a definition, the perihelion,
as mentioned, already 147.1 million km.

42
00:02:33,622 --> 00:02:36,986
You see the eccentricity of the orbit 
of the Earth is relatively small,

43
00:02:36,986 --> 00:02:38,726
but it is not a circular orbit.

44
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:42,603
In fact, the largest eccentricity we have 
is for the orbit of Mercury,

45
00:02:42,603 --> 00:02:44,183
which is quite elliptical.

46
00:02:44,953 --> 00:02:48,425
The orbit of Pluto, when it was still 
a planet in the solar system

47
00:02:48,425 --> 00:02:52,037
according to the International 
Astronomical Union,

48
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:54,126
was even more eccentric than that;

49
00:02:54,126 --> 00:02:59,500
it had a value of 0.249 eccentricity,

50
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,694
in fact, Pluto, even went
inside the orbit of Neptune

51
00:03:04,694 --> 00:03:07,015
in some part of its orbit.

52
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:10,928
Now, something to remember also, 
the orbital velocity of the Earth

53
00:03:10,928 --> 00:03:15,178
with respect to inertial frame 
is only 30 km/s.

54
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:24,016
Now, in order to plan for 
and execute a mission to another planet,

55
00:03:24,016 --> 00:03:27,620
so interplanetary trajectories planning,

56
00:03:27,620 --> 00:03:29,665
we are going to do the following.

57
00:03:29,665 --> 00:03:31,505
Normally it's a four-body problem.

58
00:03:31,505 --> 00:03:34,006
You have the Sun, 
you have the planet of departure,

59
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:36,486
which is obviously normally the Earth,

60
00:03:36,486 --> 00:03:39,165
and you have the planet of destination,

61
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:42,095
let us say, Mars, or Jupiter, or Saturn,

62
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:44,363
or inner planets, Venus or Mercury.

63
00:03:44,363 --> 00:03:46,622
And then you have the spacecraft itself.

64
00:03:46,622 --> 00:03:48,286
It is a four-body problem.

65
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:50,147
We don't want to handle 
four-body problem,

66
00:03:50,147 --> 00:03:51,577
and it is not really necessary,

67
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:54,889
as long as you are in the vicinity 
of the departure planet,

68
00:03:54,889 --> 00:03:58,641
and the departure planet, the Earth,

69
00:03:58,641 --> 00:04:03,203
then the other objects 
in the solar system do not matter.

70
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:06,167
You are on orbit around the Earth, 
on a parking orbit, let us say,

71
00:04:06,167 --> 00:04:12,353
and then you give a <i>Î”V</i>, 
or you accelerate your spacecraft

72
00:04:12,363 --> 00:04:15,212
so that you leave the area of the Earth,

73
00:04:15,212 --> 00:04:18,225
and we will define in the next slide

74
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:20,804
the concept of so-called 
sphere of influence.

75
00:04:20,804 --> 00:04:23,068
As long as you are 
within this sphere of influence

76
00:04:23,068 --> 00:04:25,518
you can consider
that the motion of the spacecraft

77
00:04:25,518 --> 00:04:27,822
with respect to the Earth
is a two-body problem

78
00:04:27,822 --> 00:04:29,621
with the Earth as a central body

79
00:04:29,621 --> 00:04:32,436
and the spacecraft 
having a very small mass

80
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:34,417
compared to the mass of the Earth.

81
00:04:34,552 --> 00:04:37,433
When you leave the sphere 
of influence of the Earth,

82
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:41,745
which happens to be 
about a 1,000,000 km in radius,

83
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:46,115
then you are 
on a heliocentric elliptical trajectory,

84
00:04:46,115 --> 00:04:48,904
pretty much a Hohmann transfer

85
00:04:48,904 --> 00:04:51,233
from the departure orbit, 
which is the orbit of the Earth,

86
00:04:51,233 --> 00:04:54,984
until the destination orbit

87
00:04:54,984 --> 00:04:57,456
which is a semi-circular orbit,

88
00:04:57,456 --> 00:05:01,132
either inside the orbit of the Earth, 
which is the case in this drawing,

89
00:05:01,132 --> 00:05:03,806
or it can be outside, 
for Mars, Jupiter or Saturn,

90
00:05:03,806 --> 00:05:06,466
or a planet of the outer solar system.

91
00:05:06,466 --> 00:05:11,596
And then, at the end 
of your heliocentric elliptic trajectory,

92
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,627
when you get in the vicinity 
of the destination planet,

93
00:05:14,627 --> 00:05:17,927
you will enter again 
the sphere of influence

94
00:05:17,927 --> 00:05:20,117
of the destination planet.

95
00:05:20,117 --> 00:05:23,543
And from that time on you can consider 
that the motion of your spacecraft,

96
00:05:23,543 --> 00:05:27,071
with respect to the destination planet,
is a two-body problem,

97
00:05:27,071 --> 00:05:30,965
with the destination planet 
being the major attracting body.

98
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:32,599
You can forget about the Sun;

99
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:35,209
obviously you have forgotten 
about the Earth a long time ago.

100
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,760
Now, for the definition 
of the sphere of influence.

101
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,874
I already explained the idea 
of the sphere of influence,

102
00:05:41,874 --> 00:05:43,205
sphere around each planet,

103
00:05:43,205 --> 00:05:45,125
inside which the motion of the spacecraft

104
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,484
is considered to be two-body Keplerian.

105
00:05:49,334 --> 00:05:53,777
Laplace determined a formula

106
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:56,777
for the radius
of this sphere of influence,

107
00:05:56,777 --> 00:05:58,407
and you have it here.

108
00:05:58,947 --> 00:06:02,821
The radius of the sphere of influence
is equal to the distance to the Sun

109
00:06:02,821 --> 00:06:06,861
multiplied by the ratio of the masses 
of the planet and the Sun

110
00:06:06,873 --> 00:06:08,473
to the power of 2/5.

111
00:06:10,668 --> 00:06:13,735
Now, obviously the size
of the sphere of influence

112
00:06:13,735 --> 00:06:15,968
will be dependent
on the distance to the Sun,

113
00:06:15,968 --> 00:06:19,918
because if you have a planet 
which is very far away from the Sun,

114
00:06:19,918 --> 00:06:23,808
let's take Neptune,

115
00:06:25,158 --> 00:06:29,507
obviously its influence 
on a spacecraft in its vicinity

116
00:06:29,507 --> 00:06:32,115
will be quite large compared 
to the influence of the Sun,

117
00:06:32,115 --> 00:06:34,495
because the Sun being so far away.

118
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:38,685
So the fact that we have a factor R, 
distance to the Sun, is obvious.

119
00:06:38,685 --> 00:06:42,289
Then the ratio of the masses 
of the planet and the Sun

120
00:06:42,289 --> 00:06:46,112
obviously has an influence, 
and Laplace determined -

121
00:06:46,112 --> 00:06:49,485
we are not going
into the detail of his thinking -

122
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:52,209
but he determined 
that we have the power 2/5

123
00:06:52,209 --> 00:06:55,489
of that ratio of the masses 
of the planets and the Sun.

124
00:06:57,083 --> 00:07:01,273
Here we have, according to this formula 
determined by Laplace,

125
00:07:01,273 --> 00:07:04,895
the size of the sphere of influence,

126
00:07:04,895 --> 00:07:07,525
the radius of the sphere of influence,

127
00:07:07,525 --> 00:07:09,870
for bodies in the solar system.

128
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,971
For the Earth, as you can see, 
we have about 1,000,000 km,

129
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:16,081
and the further away you go 
in the solar system,

130
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:17,422
as I mentioned before,

131
00:07:17,422 --> 00:07:20,577
Neptune you have 80,000,000 km,

132
00:07:20,577 --> 00:07:22,252
so it's a very large sphere of influence,

133
00:07:22,252 --> 00:07:26,332
because it's so far away from the Sun, 
and it is a pretty massive planet also.

134
00:07:26,332 --> 00:07:29,476
The last line, for the Moon,
this is not so much

135
00:07:29,476 --> 00:07:31,919
with respect to the Sun,
but with respect to the Earth,

136
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,323
66,000 km away from the center of the Moon

137
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:40,825
is the size of the sphere of influence 
around the Moon.

138
00:07:40,825 --> 00:07:44,593
You can consider that 
when you try to plan trajectories

139
00:07:44,593 --> 00:07:46,113
from the Earth to the Moon,

140
00:07:46,113 --> 00:07:48,672
although the case of the Moon
is a little more complex than that,

141
00:07:48,672 --> 00:07:52,172
because the Moon is so close to the Earth 
and it has a relatively large mass.

142
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:57,223
So the concept of sphere of influence 
is much more usable

143
00:07:57,223 --> 00:08:02,737
for motion of a spacecraft 
from the Earth to another planet

144
00:08:02,737 --> 00:08:04,737
which is much further away.

145
00:08:04,737 --> 00:08:08,227
For the Earth-Moon system 
you cannot really use that concept.
