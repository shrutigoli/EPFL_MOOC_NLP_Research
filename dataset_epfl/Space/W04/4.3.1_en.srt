00:00:05,096 --> 00:00:06,399
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:09,779
Today, we'll talk about
aerodynamic braking maneuvers.

3
00:00:10,064 --> 00:00:14,524
The idea is we need to generate <i>ΔV</i> - s, 
or change of the velocity.

4
00:00:14,563 --> 00:00:19,447
Of course, only braking <i>ΔV</i> - s
and not propulsion <i>ΔV</i> - s.

5
00:00:19,897 --> 00:00:22,847
By using an atmosphere,
the atmosphere of a planet

6
00:00:22,847 --> 00:00:25,909
or the satellite of a planet like Titan.

7
00:00:25,956 --> 00:00:29,356
It could be planet Mars, for instance,
it could be planet Venus,

8
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:31,182
both have an atmosphere.

9
00:00:31,194 --> 00:00:35,334
Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn,
also has an atmosphere.

10
00:00:35,365 --> 00:00:38,955
The idea is to come
into the vicinity of the planet

11
00:00:38,999 --> 00:00:43,409
and use the high atmosphere
of the planet or the satellite

12
00:00:43,438 --> 00:00:44,808
to generate the <i>ΔV</i>.

13
00:00:44,808 --> 00:00:48,508
So you save propellant this way
because every <i>ΔV</i> --

14
00:00:48,508 --> 00:00:52,291
we will see this in the
propulsion section of the course--

15
00:00:52,700 --> 00:00:55,420
every <i>ΔV</i> means the use of propellant.

16
00:00:55,431 --> 00:01:00,871
You try to minimize the use of propellant
during a journey in the solar system.

17
00:01:01,526 --> 00:01:06,427
So if you want to come into the vicinity
of a planet that has an atmosphere,

18
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:08,377
if you want to come into orbit
around the planet,

19
00:01:08,385 --> 00:01:10,795
you can use the atmosphere itself

20
00:01:10,816 --> 00:01:15,270
to generate a <i>ΔV</i> that will
allow, for instance, the aerocapture.

21
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:18,310
This is the first of the aerodynamic 
braking maneuvers.

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,430
You come into the vicinity of the planet

23
00:01:20,473 --> 00:01:22,933
and you have a <i>ΔV</i> generated
by the high atmosphere.

24
00:01:22,944 --> 00:01:25,054
Of course, you need to have
a thermal shield

25
00:01:25,065 --> 00:01:27,495
because there will be
an increase in temperature

26
00:01:27,516 --> 00:01:29,552
when you get into the atmosphere,

27
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:34,419
you have braking in the gases
of the high atmosphere.

28
00:01:35,199 --> 00:01:39,919
Aerocapture means you have enough <i>ΔV</i>
to be captured by the planet.

29
00:01:39,919 --> 00:01:42,039
Of course you can, as we know now,

30
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:45,299
be on a hyperbolic trajectory
in the vicinity of the planet

31
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:47,581
and if you don't have any <i>ΔV</i>,

32
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:52,507
when you come to the periapsis
of this hyperbolic trajectory,

33
00:01:52,534 --> 00:01:57,094
you are going to move away and leave
the sphere of influence after a while.

34
00:01:57,094 --> 00:01:59,845
And either you generate the <i>ΔV</i>,

35
00:01:59,845 --> 00:02:03,475
if you want to come into orbit
around the planet, by thrusters,

36
00:02:03,511 --> 00:02:06,663
or you can use the high atmosphere
to generate the <i>ΔV</i>.

37
00:02:07,563 --> 00:02:09,703
Aerocapture is very touchy

38
00:02:09,703 --> 00:02:12,315
because suppose you come
a little bit too close

39
00:02:12,315 --> 00:02:16,580
to the center of the planet and the
high-density layers of the atmosphere,

40
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:19,312
you'll have a <i>ΔV</i> which is more 
than what you were hoping,

41
00:02:19,357 --> 00:02:22,897
and you may have an uncontrolled
entry into the planet.

42
00:02:23,969 --> 00:02:27,549
If you are a little bit too high,
higher than you were planning,

43
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:29,958
then you may have too small a <i>ΔV</i>,

44
00:02:30,005 --> 00:02:35,225
you may not be able to reach a velocity
under the escape velocity,

45
00:02:35,246 --> 00:02:38,706
you may still, although you'll change
the shape of your trajectory,

46
00:02:38,732 --> 00:02:41,232
you may still escape the planet.

47
00:02:41,252 --> 00:02:45,242
So, in fact, in practice,
aerocapture has never been used.

48
00:02:45,247 --> 00:02:48,019
The second method
for aerodynamic braking

49
00:02:48,019 --> 00:02:49,579
is aerobraking.

50
00:02:49,614 --> 00:02:55,254
Suppose you are already 
on an elliptical orbit around the planet,

51
00:02:55,292 --> 00:02:59,620
and every pass at the periapsis
of your trajectory

52
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:02,300
brings you into
the high layers of the atmosphere,

53
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,645
then you have aerobraking.

54
00:03:03,645 --> 00:03:06,513
On every orbit,
you have a little bit of braking,

55
00:03:06,513 --> 00:03:08,863
you reduce the energy of your orbit.

56
00:03:08,867 --> 00:03:11,687
The last method is the aeroentry.

57
00:03:11,687 --> 00:03:15,900
This was used at the end 
of the Shuttle mission, for instance.

58
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,670
You do a little bit of a braking maneuver

59
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,644
from your practically circular orbit
outside of the Earth's atmosphere.

60
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:27,648
You come in on a trajectory,
which in this case is elliptical,

61
00:03:27,648 --> 00:03:29,818
directly into the Earth's atmosphere.

62
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,863
It was also the case for Soyuz
and obviously the case also

63
00:03:32,933 --> 00:03:38,440
for the command module
of the Apollo program.

64
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,200
When they were coming back from the Moon,

65
00:03:40,217 --> 00:03:43,197
they had direct aeroentry
into the Earth's atmosphere

66
00:03:43,232 --> 00:03:45,572
and then they splashed down
into the ocean.

67
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:48,827
Aerocapture, we've already
said a few words about it.

68
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:53,389
This is a more detailed
description of what happens.

69
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:57,721
This is your spacecraft
on a hyperbolic trajectory

70
00:03:57,751 --> 00:04:02,952
within the sphere of influence
of the planet, here.

71
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:08,002
You have targeted the parameters
of your approach to the planet,

72
00:04:08,021 --> 00:04:11,215
mainly the choice of the impact parameter,

73
00:04:11,215 --> 00:04:13,535
the infinity that we talked about before.

74
00:04:13,535 --> 00:04:17,032
So that you come here,

75
00:04:17,032 --> 00:04:20,032
in the high atmosphere of the planet

76
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:23,042
and you're going to have that <i>ΔV</i>

77
00:04:23,064 --> 00:04:27,574
generated by this pass 
in the high atmosphere of the planet.

78
00:04:27,598 --> 00:04:30,465
<i>ΔV</i>, and again,
you have to target everything

79
00:04:30,465 --> 00:04:33,695
so that the <i>ΔV</i> is 
what you were planning to have.

80
00:04:33,695 --> 00:04:36,335
Certainly not more 
than what you were planning

81
00:04:36,372 --> 00:04:39,152
because you may have uncontrolled reentry.

82
00:04:39,208 --> 00:04:43,644
At some point you exit
the atmosphere of the planet.

83
00:04:43,644 --> 00:04:44,848
Everything has been planned

84
00:04:44,848 --> 00:04:49,148
so you're now on an elliptical orbit 
around the planet

85
00:04:49,148 --> 00:04:52,028
with an apoapsis at this point.

86
00:04:53,076 --> 00:04:56,716
Now you need to do something
when you are at this point here

87
00:04:56,726 --> 00:05:00,766
because if you don't want to come back
in the atmosphere of the planet

88
00:05:00,773 --> 00:05:05,203
at the periapsis of your new orbit,

89
00:05:05,216 --> 00:05:08,846
you need to increase
the energy of the orbit,

90
00:05:08,871 --> 00:05:12,731
increase the velocity
so that you come on an orbit

91
00:05:12,755 --> 00:05:17,965
which, at the periapsis, comes outside
of the atmosphere of the planet.

92
00:05:17,969 --> 00:05:24,344
So if you want to do aerocapture,
you have the <i>ΔV</i> caused by the pass

93
00:05:24,344 --> 00:05:27,524
through the high layers
of the atmosphere at the periapsis.

94
00:05:28,197 --> 00:05:31,507
Then, at the apoapsis of your new
elliptical orbit round the planet,

95
00:05:31,527 --> 00:05:33,397
you need to increase the energy

96
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:36,452
so you don't come back
into the atmosphere on the second pass.

97
00:05:36,452 --> 00:05:39,782
Aerobraking, I've already 
mentioned before.

98
00:05:39,782 --> 00:05:41,322
Here's an illustration of it.

99
00:05:41,345 --> 00:05:45,335
Suppose you're on an elliptical orbit
around the planet.

100
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:46,940
This is the apoapsis,

101
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:50,746
this is the periapsis which is
within the atmosphere of the planet

102
00:05:50,772 --> 00:05:53,992
which is in pale orange color here.

103
00:05:54,030 --> 00:06:00,780
So if you have several consecutive passes

104
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,130
in the high atmosphere of the planet,

105
00:06:03,179 --> 00:06:08,169
of course, you will lose energy
little by little at every pass

106
00:06:08,179 --> 00:06:10,969
at the periapsis through the atmosphere.

107
00:06:10,985 --> 00:06:12,555
So your orbit will decay

108
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:15,790
and the apoapsis
will become smaller and smaller.

109
00:06:15,818 --> 00:06:20,435
Of course, you reduce the value of a,
the semi-major axis of your orbit

110
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:22,945
and consequently you reduce
the energy of your orbit.

111
00:06:22,971 --> 00:06:25,496
At some point,
when you're here for instance,

112
00:06:25,496 --> 00:06:28,288
you may want again
to give a posigrade burn

113
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,618
to increase the energy of your orbit

114
00:06:30,618 --> 00:06:34,548
so that the next pass at the apoapsis,

115
00:06:34,561 --> 00:06:36,141
at the periapsis, sorry,

116
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:39,175
will be outside
the atmosphere of the planet,

117
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:43,595
so you can come into an elliptical
or circular orbit around the planet.

118
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,267
This is typically the case

119
00:06:46,267 --> 00:06:52,577
where the first apoapsis
is too high for the circular orbit,

120
00:06:52,595 --> 00:06:54,855
so you wait for that decay to take place

121
00:06:54,889 --> 00:06:57,079
until you are at the proper height.

122
00:06:57,098 --> 00:06:59,288
And if you want to have a circular orbit

123
00:06:59,329 --> 00:07:02,719
around the planet at that altitude,

124
00:07:02,764 --> 00:07:06,114
which corresponds here to the apoapsis
of your elliptical orbit,

125
00:07:06,163 --> 00:07:09,143
then you do a posigrade burn
to circularize at this point.

126
00:07:11,288 --> 00:07:16,428
Aeroentry, as mentioned,
is the end of a mission or lower orbit

127
00:07:16,484 --> 00:07:21,224
for the Shuttle in the past
and for Soyuz these days.

128
00:07:21,224 --> 00:07:23,601
After visiting
the International Space Station,

129
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:28,518
bringing crews to ISS or bringing back
crews to the surface of the Earth.

130
00:07:28,534 --> 00:07:32,344
Of course, in the case of Soyuz,
you don't have a splashdown

131
00:07:32,367 --> 00:07:34,617
like you have here
for the Apollo capsule

132
00:07:34,664 --> 00:07:38,314
but you come down on firm ground,
with braking with a parachute

133
00:07:38,334 --> 00:07:43,344
and retro rockets for the last few meters
before impact with the ground.

134
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:49,529
This is the example
of the Apollo command module

135
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:53,579
coming back from
a 3½ days journey from the Moon.

136
00:07:53,616 --> 00:07:57,526
The velocity of entry
of the service module

137
00:07:57,554 --> 00:07:59,774
with the three crew members on board

138
00:07:59,776 --> 00:08:01,726
in the high atmosphere was very high.

139
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:04,040
It was of the order of 11 km per second.

140
00:08:04,084 --> 00:08:06,674
It was close to the escape velocity.

141
00:08:06,946 --> 00:08:08,516
So it was a very high velocity,

142
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:12,030
much more than you have
if you come back from a lower orbit

143
00:08:12,049 --> 00:08:13,839
where typically you come back

144
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:16,719
with a velocity of about 8 km per second.

145
00:08:16,738 --> 00:08:18,318
Apollo was much higher than that.

146
00:08:18,356 --> 00:08:23,956
In fact, it was pretty difficult
in planning

147
00:08:23,982 --> 00:08:25,821
because the service module,

148
00:08:25,821 --> 00:08:28,401
the command module, sorry,

149
00:08:28,401 --> 00:08:32,171
had to come for splashdown in the ocean

150
00:08:32,171 --> 00:08:34,615
in the vicinity of boats
which were prepared

151
00:08:34,615 --> 00:08:38,005
to recover the crew and the capsule.

152
00:08:39,442 --> 00:08:41,242
A lot of planning had to take place

153
00:08:41,296 --> 00:08:47,066
and the longitude
of the impact point on the ocean

154
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:51,536
depended on the timing
of the whole trajectory

155
00:08:51,579 --> 00:08:55,459
and the latitude depended
on the declination of the Moon

156
00:08:55,491 --> 00:08:58,421
at the time of the beginning
of the return trajectory

157
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,900
from the Moon orbit to the Earth.

158
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:05,572
So the planning was quite tough,
but it was successful

159
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:09,212
on every one of the six returns 
from the Moon,

160
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:12,260
in the Apollo program,
from Apollo 11 to Apollo 17.

161
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:17,170
In fact, it was seven in total
because we had Apollo 13

162
00:09:17,184 --> 00:09:20,074
that didn't land on the Moon
but of course returned

163
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:23,100
in an aeroentry, as I mentioned.

164
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,986
In fact, the aeroentry
in the case of the Apollo program

165
00:09:26,018 --> 00:09:27,998
for the command module was in two steps.

166
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:31,202
You had a first kind of rebound
in the atmosphere.

167
00:09:31,212 --> 00:09:33,385
Then you had the final entry.

168
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:35,405
There was a double entry
in the atmosphere.

169
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:38,890
All of this had been planned
and worked perfectly well.
