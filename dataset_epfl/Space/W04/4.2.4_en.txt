We are coming toward the end of our journey to the destination planet after a pretty long-duration arc on this elliptical trajectory around the Sun, let's take the example of a trajectory from the Earth to Mars.
It's about 8 months of duration orbit on a Hohmann transfer so elliptical heliocentric trajectory from the Earth to Mars.
And we come in the vicinity of the destination planet.
What is important is the time.
We will consider that we are on this heliocentric trajectory, this elliptical arc around the Sun, until we come close enough to the destination planet that we can forget about the Sun and then consider only the motion of our spacecraft with respect to the destination planet on this, of course, hyperbolic trajectory inside the sphere of influence of the destination planet.
Now, we arrive at this velocity, now it's <i>v_a âˆž</i>.
It's a hyperbolic excess velocity, but for arrival.
It's a small <i>v</i> because it's with respect to the planet it's a planetocentric velocity, it's equal to large <i>V_S</i>,
<i>S</i> is for spacecraft.
It's large because it's heliocentric.
It's the difference between heliocentric velocity of the spacecraft and the heliocentric velocity of the planet. P is for planet.
So, we are penetrating the sphere of influence of the destination planet.
Again, it does not matter what the size of this sphere of influence is.
At some point we do this transition from a heliocentric trajectory, where we forget about the destination planet in terms of gravitational effect, and then we come inside this sphere of influence, we forget about the Sun, and we only consider the relative motion of our spacecraft with respect to the destination planet.
Here we are with <i>v_a âˆž</i>, we penetrate the sphere of influence.
Of course, we have a hyperbolic trajectory inside the sphere of influence.
Now, in order to accomplish the goal that we want to accomplish, we may want to either come and orbit around the destination planet, we may want to have a direct hit on the planet, hopefully doing a soft landing and doing a braking maneuver close to the surface to the planet, we may want to do just a flyby, which was the case for New Horizons doing a flyby with Pluto at the end of 2015.
But anyway, whatever we want to do, we need to select so-called impact parameter, <i>d_âˆž</i>, which is the distance to the planet on a plane, the B-plane, which is perpendicular to <i>v_a âˆž</i>, and passing by the destination planet itself.
That's the destination planet: the center of this circle.
We select a value of <i>d_âˆž</i>, and we need to select also the angle <i>Î¸</i>.
If here we have the equator of the destination planet, we may want to come on an orbit which is an equatorial orbit around the destination planet or we may want to come on a polar orbit, which will be the case in this drawing.
But, anyway, we need to select, these are flight controllers in the control room controlling the motion of the spacecraft that select the value of <i>d_âˆž</i>, on one hand, and <i>Î¸</i> in order to accomplish the planned goals.
This is our destination planet here, this is our hyperbolic excess velocity at arrival, and we have the sphere of influence which is centered on the destination planet with the radius that, again, is irrelevant in the case of our treatment of this,
I would say, three-segment motion from the departure planet all the way to the arrival planet.
The first segment being inside the sphere of influence of the departure planet, and we have the heliocentric trajectory,
Hohmann transfer, where we forget about the departure planet, and then we have the arrival inside the sphere of influence of the destination planet, where we forget about the Sun.
Here we are, this is the hyperbolic arc of our trajectory inside the sphere of influence.
At this point here we have the perigee, or periapsis, rather, because we don't talk about the Earth anymore, but about any object in the solar system.
You see some values of the geometry here.
We talked about <i>d_âˆž</i>, the impact parameter, which is here, inside this B-plane, as I described before, this plane perpendicular to the arrival infinity and passing through the center of the planet.
We have selected the value of <i>Î¸</i>, also, in order to decide if we have a polar orbit, equatorial orbit or something in between.
Let's write some expressions here.
We have to consider that the situation is very similar to the situation with the departure.
We have a similar hyperbolic arc, we have a point, the closest to the, this time, destination planet, no longer the departure planet which is the Earth, but we have this relationship between <i>a</i> and <i>v_a âˆž</i>. a equal to <i>&micro;</i> over <i>(v_a âˆž)&sup2;</i>
Now, <i>v_a âˆž</i> is, again, given by the circumstance of our arrival.
We cannot really choose that.
That's the difference between our heliocentric velocity when we arrive at the sphere of influence, and the velocity of the planet itself.
However, the value of <i>v_a âˆž</i> will give us the value of <i>a</i>, the semi-major axis of the hyperbola of arrival inside the sphere of influence.
What we know is <i>v_a âˆž</i>, again, this is given by the overall trajectory characteristics of our journey in the solar system to get to the destination, and we choose the impact parameter, <i>d_âˆž</i>.
Now, let's look at this triangle here.
And we have <i>r_p + a</i>, which is equal to <i>c</i>, by the way, is equal to square root - we just resolve this triangle.
Now, this is good, because we know the value of <i>a</i> because of this expression that we had here.
We select the value of <i>d_âˆž</i>, <i>v_a âˆž</i> we know,
<i>Î¼</i> is the mass of the destination planet multiplied by the constant of gravitation.
So we will be able to determine the value of <i>r_p</i>.
Let's express that because that's an important parameter.
That's really going to give us important data about the close point to the planet.
If it's a planet with an atmosphere, we're going to get inside the upper layers of the atmosphere of the planet where we have an extra braking on us.
It's a very important parameter.
Let's take it out.
So we have the value of <i>r_p</i>, knowing all the other parameters, including <i>d_âˆž</i>, which we select as a flight controller to accomplish mission objectives.
And as far as the angle <i>Î²</i> is concerned, giving us the angular aspect of our deviation between our arrival <i>v_a âˆž</i> direction of the direction of our velocity vector, when we come at the closest point to the planet we have <i>cos Î² = a / (a + r_p) = a / c</i>.
And again, <i>r_p</i> we know, <i>a</i> we know, so we know what the value of <i>Î²</i> is.
That's another important parameter that we can derive from what we know already.
If we want to do an orbit insertion around the destination planet, let's look at this situation.
So we have here the arrival hyperbolic orbit, and we come here to the periapsis, the point of our trajectory, the closest to the destination planet.
The planet looks like it's the Earth here, but it does not matter.
Let's say, it's a destination planet like Mars, or Jupiter, or Saturn, or an inner planet like Mercury or Venus.
And this is the elliptical orbit that we desire to have around the destination planet.
Let's look at this point here, the periapsis of our hyperbolic trajectory.
Let's use the following terminology here. when we have <i>H</i> is for hyperbola: this is valid for our trajectory inside the sphere of influence, we'll use <i>i</i> for insertion, we use <i>p</i>, like we normally do, for periapsis.
Now, we arrive with this velocity here, which is a velocity on our hyperbolic trajectory at the periapsis.
Now, what we want is this velocity for the insertion into the close orbit, elliptical orbit around the destination planet, so it's around the planet, and <i>i</i> is for insertion.
And <i>Î”V_i</i> is the braking maneuver in <i>Î”V</i> that we have to do in order to be able to insert ourselves in this trajectory around the destination planet.
So we have <i>Î”V_i</i>, <i>i</i> for insertion, equal to the absolute value of our periapsis velocity on our hyperbolic trajectory minus <i>V_i p</i>.
This is a velocity at periapsis of our desired elliptical orbit around the destination planet.
And that's equal to-- we could look at the geometry here...
<i>square root of (2&micro;/r_p + (v_a âˆž)&sup2;)</i>
And we have a plus here because this is an arc of a hyperbola.
<i> minus the square root of (2&micro;/r_p - &micro;/a_i)</i>
<i>a_i</i> is a semi-major axis of our desired elliptical orbit around the destination planet.
So this is <i>a_i</i>.
This is a velocity on the desired elliptical orbit, at the periapsis of this elliptical orbit, and this is our velocity on a hyperbolic trajectory at the periapsis.
So the difference between the two will give us <i>Î”V_i</i>, so we know how much we need to brake in km per second in order to insert ourselves in that elliptical orbit around the destination planet.
