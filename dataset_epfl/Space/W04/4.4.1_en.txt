Today we'll talk about rocket propulsion, and the fundamental equation about propulsion is the Tsiolkovsky equation, which you see here, or which is called also the "rocket equation."
It gives you the change in the velocity, Å’Ã®Vs, that you get with a rocket system moving along a straight line.
If you have a <i>v_e</i> for the exhaust velocity of the gas in the propulsion system, and you have a certain initial mass and a final mass if you look at these drawings here, this is the rocket at the beginning of the exercise initial mass for the total rocket plus propellant, it has an initial velocity, <i>v_i</i>.
Sometime in between, after a few seconds or a few minutes of propulsion, you have exhausted some of the propellant in the tank, and you end up with final conditions, here, where you have <i>v final</i>, and you have a total mass of <i>m_f</i>.
<i>m_f</i>, again, is the total mass; it's the mass of the rocket, the dry mass of the rocket.
When we say "dry mass" it's the mass without a propellant, plus the remaining propellant.
So between the initial state and the final state you have used a certain amount of propellant, which is, in fact, equal to <i>m_i</i> minus <i>m_f</i>, the total mass initial, minus the total mass final.
And we consider that <i>v_e</i>, the exhaust velocity of the gases, is constant during the whole exercise.
Now this is the Tsiolkovsky equation, or rocket equation.
Remember it for the rest of your days.
Let's derive the Tsiolkovsky equation from the basic laws of physics, in fact, basically the second law of Newton.
Let's consider first our rocket, our spacecraft, with a propellant tank and the thruster system static, and we'll try to derive the value of the force of the thrust in newtons, or in kilograms we can express it normally in newtons, but it can be expressed in kilograms also on the basis of the mass rates of the propellant and the oxidizer and the ejection velocity.
So we have the thrust force, <i>F</i>, equals <i>dp / dt</i>,
<i>d(mv) / dt</i>.
In our case, if we have the static case, we only have the ejection of the hot gases out of the thruster to the right side, so it's going to be equal to <i>Â·Ï€Ã…v_e</i>, and <i>v_e</i> is the ejection velocity of the gases out of the thruster, and the <i>Â·Ï€Ã…</i> is basically the rate of utilization of the propellants plus the oxidizer.
I put here plus the oxidizer because obviously, unlike an airplane with a jet engine where you get the oxygen from the ambient atmosphere, here you need to carry the oxidizer, so <i>Â·Ï€Ã…</i> is <i>dm/dt</i>, the time derivative of the mass, propellant plus oxidizer.
Let's now take our rocket, moving in space, with a velocity, <i>V</i>, and we consider that the rocket is moving in free space; it's not subject to any acceleration due to nearby masses; it has no braking due to any atmosphere.
It's in free space, absolutely alone in the universe, and all the values that we have for velocity are with respect to inertial frame.
So we have <i>V = dV/dt</i> is equal to <i>F</i> divided by the mass of the spacecraft plus the tank and the propellant remaining, at some point.
So <i>dV/dt</i>, the time derivative of the velocity acceleration, is equal to <i>v_e</i>, on the basis of what we did before, times <i>Â·Ï€Ã… / m</i>.
So <i>V</i> is the velocity of the spacecraft, of the rocket.
And, of course, this is with respect to inertial space.
So if we integrate this expression, we find the Tsiolkovsky equation,
Å’Ã®V = ï£¿v_e and the logarithm base e of the ratio of <i>m_i</i> / <i>m_f</i>.
This is called Tsiolkovsky or rocket equation, and we have, of course,
<i>i</i> for initial conditions, and <i>f</i>, final conditions.
And this is it, that's it:
Tsiolkovsky, or rocket equation.
We are going to introduce a new parameter, which is I_sp the specific impulse in seconds, and this is what is normally used as a measure of the efficiency of a thruster system.
It's not totally intuitive that exhaust velocity of the gases is a measure of the efficiency of the propulsion system, but I will introduce that parameter, and you will understand why we say <i>I_sp</i> is that measure of the efficiency of the propulsion system.
In fact, I_sp is the thrust of the propulsion system in kilograms, or the thrust in newtons, divided by <i>g</i>,
<i>g</i> being 9.81 m/sÂ¬â‰¤, divided by the rate of utilization of the propellant, propellant plus oxidizer.
So you can understand that if, for a given rate of utilization of a propellant, in kg/s, you have a higher value of the thrust, you have an efficient system.
Or if, for a given thrust, you have a low rate of utilization propellant plus oxidizer, you can also understand that you have a highly efficient system.
Now let me derive this concept of <i>I_sp</i> from the <i>v_e</i> that we used before, because what we had before, of course were the <i>g â€šÃ„Â¢ I_sp = v_e</i>, so we have <i>g I_sp = v_e</i>.
So from this we have <i>I_sp = v_e/g</i> and, again <i>g</i> is the Earth's gravity acceleration to the surface of the Earth, 9.81 m/sÂ¬â‰¤.
So from what we saw on the previous slide, this is equal to <i>f</i>, which is, of course, a newton, divided by <i>g</i>, divided by Â·Ï€Ã….
So this is the thrust of the propulsion system in kilograms, because it's the newton divided by <i>g</i>, which gives you in kilograms, and this is the rate of utilization of the propellant plus oxidizer.
This is kilograms, and this is kilograms per second.
So I_sp is going to be in seconds.
The relationship between I_sp in seconds and v_e is going to be a factor 9.81, or factor 10.
If you have an <i>I_sp</i> of 460 we'll see later that this is a pretty large I_sp you get for liquid oxygen, liquid hydrogen propulsion system, like the Space Shuttle main engines, it will give you a 4,500 m/s exhaust velocity, or 4.5 km/s.
So we have to remember this ratio of about 10 between the value of I_sp in seconds and the exhaust velocity in m/s.
Chemical propulsion, which is, of course, very common.
In all the rockets that we talked about before we have a chemical propulsion for all of the stages all the way to orbit insertion.
Now you see, for various chemicals, the value of the specific impulse in seconds--
In fact, the highest value we get, with liquid hydrogen as a propellant and liquid oxygen as an oxidizer will give us about 450 for the specific impulse, which means that we have an exhaust velocity of about 4.5 km/s.
You see that if you have other combinations of oxidizer and propellants you have values of <i>I_sp</i> of the order of 350.
If you use kerosene, or hydrazine, or monomethyl hydrazine, a pretty common value of <i>I_sp</i> is 350, or 3.5 km/s for the exhaust velocity.
If you use a monopropellant hydrazine, this is a monopropellant, it's a liquid that in contact with a catalyzer will produce a gas, and it has a relatively low value of I_sp of a little below 250.
Now as far as cold gas propulsion is concerned, you have a rather low value of the I_sp which means a low efficiency and solid motor, which is the case for most of the launchers we talked about before.
It has, for the first stage, the central core, plus solid motor system, like Ariane 5 has that.
Delta IV has that, too, and obviously the Space Shuttle had this also, and the solid motors were separated after two minutes, fell down in the ocean, and were recovered.
In all the other systems the solid propulsion system is not recovered.
But anyway, solid motor gives you about 280-300 as <i>I_sp</i> so quite a bit less efficient than liquid hydrogen, liquid oxygen, which is the best for chemical propulsion.
Well this is an interesting graph, taken from a very good book of Arthur Clarke, <i>Ascent to Orbit</i>, which was written in the late '40s or early '50s, so quite an old book, but really very, very well written, about the concept of the use of the geostationary orbit.
He's the one, Arthur Clarke, who invented the idea of the geostationary satellite for communication.
And also there are interesting chapters on propulsion.
This is a graph of the final velocity, or the Å’Ã®V, because the initial velocity is zero, versus the mass ratio, which is <i>m_i</i> / <i>m_f</i> for different values of v_e or the exhaust velocity of the gases.
And it's really interesting, because you see that if you want to get a final velocity of about 10 km/s, which is about what you want in low Earth orbit.
Of course we know that we need only about 7.7 or 8 km/s on low Earth orbits, but you need, in your rocket system, more than that, because you have losses-- gravitational losses, on one hand, and also drag losses in the atmosphere as you go towards orbit.
So you want to have a capability of about 10-11 km/s in your rocket.
Now you see that if you have oxygen or hydrogen, which is a 4.5 km/s exhaust velocity, and you want about 10-11 final velocity, you realize that the mass ratio is going to be about 10, which is really a very startling number.
Your initial mass divided by your final mass is a factor 10, which means that in a rocket system, whether it's Space Shuttle, or Ariane, or Delta IV, or Proton or any rocket, most of the mass at lift-off is the mass of the propellants.
About 80-90% of the mass is mass of propellant.
So quite an interesting graph, showing the significant amount of propellant that you need to take at lift-off from the Earth's surface if you want to go into orbit.
We'll look at the mass of propellant needed.
What interests us, really, is the value of the mass of the propellant in order to accomplish a certain Å’Ã®V, considering a certain value of the <i>I_sp</i>, or the specific impulse of the propellant being used.
So we have the Tsiolkovsky equation here.
What interests us here in the bottom is the mass of propellants, the difference between the initial mass and the final mass.
Again, let's look at the drawings.
Here we have the initial conditions with <i>m_i</i> for the total mass, the dry mass of the rocket plus the tank, plus the propellant, with a certain v initial.
This is an intermediate situation here.
These are the final condition where we have the spacecraft with a final velocity, which has obviously increased.
After a time, Å’Ã®T, we got Å’Ã®V, and we have a final mass, <i> m_f</i>, which is the dry mass of the rocket plus the tank, plus the remaining of the propellant.
So the difference between <i>m_i</i> and <i>m_f</i> is the propellant that has been used.
Now, what interests us is really the value of m_p, and let's go up there.
And we see here that m_p is equal to m_i minus m_f times this exponential, which is m_f, or we can express it here, if we want to express it in terms of m_f, this is equal to m_i minus m_f.
So these are two expressions of the mass of propellant, depending on the initial mass and the Å’Ã®V and the I_sp or the final mass of the Å’Ã®V and I_sp.
