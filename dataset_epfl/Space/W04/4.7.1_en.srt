1
00:00:09,667 --> 00:00:13,084
Hello, my name is Dr. Michael Foale.

2
00:00:13,117 --> 00:00:16,280
I'm a former NASA astronaut.

3
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,603
I was born in Great Britain,
but my mother is American,

4
00:00:21,604 --> 00:00:24,100
and my father was
a British Royal Air Force pilot.

5
00:00:24,753 --> 00:00:27,642
With that combination, I was able to apply

6
00:00:27,643 --> 00:00:31,765
to the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration, NASA,

7
00:00:33,042 --> 00:00:34,700
to become an astronaut.

8
00:00:35,451 --> 00:00:38,010
It began with many small steps

9
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:43,013
and the first of them was to finish
a PhD in Astrophysics

10
00:00:43,014 --> 00:00:45,301
at Cambridge University in England,

11
00:00:45,681 --> 00:00:51,482
to move across to the Houston
Johnson Space Center in America,

12
00:00:51,803 --> 00:00:54,573
and while wanting to be an astronaut,

13
00:00:54,574 --> 00:00:59,457
I was not yet able to apply
because there wasn't a selection process.

14
00:00:59,458 --> 00:01:00,793
I had to find a job.

15
00:01:02,758 --> 00:01:06,241
I worked in Houston
at the Johnson Space Center

16
00:01:06,955 --> 00:01:13,723
for two years before I was finally
selected as an astronaut.

17
00:01:25,989 --> 00:01:27,461
When I was working at NASA,

18
00:01:28,271 --> 00:01:32,620
I had a job in payload operations.

19
00:01:32,621 --> 00:01:37,526
This was a job very much
like the ones you've seen

20
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:39,394
at the European Space Agency

21
00:01:39,395 --> 00:01:41,804
where people are working
in a control center,

22
00:01:41,805 --> 00:01:46,944
they have knowledge about the spacecraft
that they are controlling and monitoring

23
00:01:46,945 --> 00:01:50,369
as they carry out their missions in space,

24
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:56,775
and my job was to carry out
payload operations for the Space Shuttle.

25
00:01:57,818 --> 00:02:02,070
The Space Shuttle
carried cargo into space,

26
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:06,635
including telecommunication satellites
that we all take for granted today,

27
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:10,437
that achieve all
of the amazing communications

28
00:02:10,439 --> 00:02:13,111
that we have around the Earth
and between the planets.

29
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:16,486
These satellites were being carried
on the Space Shuttle.

30
00:02:16,487 --> 00:02:22,951
My job was to know how
the satellite worked, functionally,

31
00:02:22,952 --> 00:02:24,727
not in terms of the electronics

32
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,820
and all of the details
of the mechanical engineering,

33
00:02:26,821 --> 00:02:30,295
but functionally: what key operations
take place in that satellite,

34
00:02:30,296 --> 00:02:32,737
and to monitor the behavior
of that satellite

35
00:02:32,738 --> 00:02:34,748
when it was launched on the Space Shuttle.

36
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:42,204
I could tell you now a little bit
about what I was doing

37
00:02:42,205 --> 00:02:43,978
during those missions.

38
00:02:46,058 --> 00:02:50,945
In the control center
I was called the "Payload Officer"

39
00:02:50,946 --> 00:02:54,040
and I was sitting
in the mission control center

40
00:02:54,041 --> 00:02:57,227
that I think many people
in the world have seen on TV

41
00:02:57,228 --> 00:02:59,360
when we've conducted space missions,

42
00:02:59,537 --> 00:03:01,451
both to the International Space Station,

43
00:03:01,571 --> 00:03:04,411
but before that, Space Shuttle missions,

44
00:03:04,412 --> 00:03:08,382
and before that, the Apollo missions
that landed on the Moon.

45
00:03:08,933 --> 00:03:10,238
In that control center

46
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:13,254
-- which was an amazing honor
for me, to do that as a young man.

47
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:14,949
I was about 27.

48
00:03:16,544 --> 00:03:19,851
I had a sign in front of me
called "Payload Officer"

49
00:03:20,614 --> 00:03:24,236
and when the Space Shuttle, for example,

50
00:03:25,626 --> 00:03:30,293
Space Transportation System,
STS-61B launched,

51
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:36,695
we were launching
two Satcom RCA satellites

52
00:03:36,696 --> 00:03:38,566
to geosynchronous orbit.

53
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:45,456
Those satellites were probably
worth 200 or 300 million dollars each

54
00:03:45,457 --> 00:03:47,371
but they were flying
on the Space Shuttle

55
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:49,413
for quite a low price,

56
00:03:49,414 --> 00:03:52,273
much lower than the price
of building those satellites.

57
00:03:53,216 --> 00:03:56,657
I had, in the previous year,
visited that company,

58
00:03:56,658 --> 00:03:59,936
worked with their engineers,
worked with their program manager,

59
00:03:59,937 --> 00:04:02,092
and developed drawings and procedures

60
00:04:02,093 --> 00:04:06,150
that the astronauts
that were launching on STS-61B

61
00:04:06,151 --> 00:04:11,173
would use to deploy that satellite
out of the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle

62
00:04:11,174 --> 00:04:16,485
where the Shuttle
would then move away from it,

63
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:21,279
and it would fire its final rocket motor,
a solid rocket motor,

64
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:27,558
and thrust it out
towards geosynchronous orbit.

65
00:04:28,282 --> 00:04:30,543
All those tasks on those missions,

66
00:04:30,544 --> 00:04:35,470
the Space Shuttle missions
51G, 51I, 61B and 61C,

67
00:04:35,471 --> 00:04:40,015
they were all cargo missions
on the Space Shuttle

68
00:04:40,016 --> 00:04:44,284
carrying communications satellites
up to geosynchronous orbit.

69
00:04:44,285 --> 00:04:46,646
Now, the Space Shuttle
can't go up that high.

70
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:48,691
You can only go to Low Earth Orbit.

71
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:50,472
But my job was,

72
00:04:50,473 --> 00:04:52,850
as the payload officer
in the control center,

73
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:55,760
to know the details of those satellites,
how they worked;

74
00:04:56,619 --> 00:05:00,747
and help train the astronauts
with procedures I wrote and developed,

75
00:05:00,748 --> 00:05:02,320
knowing the satellite,

76
00:05:02,321 --> 00:05:05,794
and then the astronaut trainers
would train the astronauts

77
00:05:05,795 --> 00:05:10,525
to operate those satellites
in a simulator,

78
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:14,484
and then during the actual mission,
I would be in the mission control center

79
00:05:14,485 --> 00:05:19,764
watching displays, seeing
how those satellites' critical parameters

80
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:21,994
are behaving on the Space Shuttle.

81
00:05:21,995 --> 00:05:25,108
At the right moment I would give the go

82
00:05:25,109 --> 00:05:27,786
to the flight director
in that control center

83
00:05:27,787 --> 00:05:31,355
to say "flight, we are go for deploy"

84
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:36,028
at which point the CAPCOM
would call the crew on the Space Shuttle

85
00:05:36,029 --> 00:05:41,013
and say, "Columbia, we are go
for the deploy of the Satcom,"

86
00:05:41,014 --> 00:05:43,070
at which point they would throw a switch,

87
00:05:43,071 --> 00:05:47,003
and it would release locks
in the cargo bay of the Space Shuttle,

88
00:05:47,004 --> 00:05:50,221
and the satellite would rise up
out of the cargo bay

89
00:05:50,222 --> 00:05:54,724
with a booster underneath it,
a solid rocket booster.

90
00:05:54,725 --> 00:06:00,580
Then the Space Shuttle would move away
to a safe distance, a few kilometers,

91
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:04,832
and about 45 minutes later,
after that deploy,

92
00:06:04,833 --> 00:06:09,215
as the satellite crosses
the right point in the orbit,

93
00:06:09,216 --> 00:06:14,874
actually intersects the plane
of the orbit with the Equator

94
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:17,226
because they're going
into geosynchronous orbit,

95
00:06:17,227 --> 00:06:19,509
then that PAM motor would fire

96
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:21,497
and the solid rocket motor would boost it

97
00:06:21,498 --> 00:06:27,722
and add another 3,000 meters per second

98
00:06:27,723 --> 00:06:31,577
to get the satellite
up to geosynchronous orbit.

99
00:06:31,578 --> 00:06:34,956
Once that motor's fired, my job's done

100
00:06:34,957 --> 00:06:37,624
and all the astronauts
on the Space Shuttle

101
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:40,460
and flight controllers
in the mission control center room

102
00:06:40,461 --> 00:06:42,004
would all relax and cheer,

103
00:06:42,005 --> 00:06:43,297
because from that point on,

104
00:06:43,417 --> 00:06:47,105
all of the operations were
in the hands of the satellite builder

105
00:06:47,106 --> 00:06:49,478
and that's basically what I did

106
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:53,274
for a year and a half
while working at NASA

107
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:59,382
before I was finally selected
by the NASA astronaut selection committee

108
00:06:59,383 --> 00:07:02,102
which was on my third try, by the way.

109
00:07:10,466 --> 00:07:15,713
Basically, I was in Houston
working at the Johnson Space Center,

110
00:07:15,714 --> 00:07:19,203
becoming more experienced in operations.

111
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:23,879
I was a good scientist. I had a PhD 
from Cambridge in Astrophysics,

112
00:07:24,149 --> 00:07:28,816
but I had to show
to the astronaut colleagues

113
00:07:28,817 --> 00:07:30,616
that I would be working with

114
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:32,846
--many of whom had
military backgrounds,

115
00:07:32,847 --> 00:07:35,574
and could fly fast fighter jets,
for example,

116
00:07:35,575 --> 00:07:39,024
or could work
as special operations engineers--

117
00:07:39,025 --> 00:07:40,269
I had to show them

118
00:07:40,270 --> 00:07:42,607
that I could actually think well,

119
00:07:43,334 --> 00:07:46,736
on a timeline, using procedures,

120
00:07:46,737 --> 00:07:48,551
not panic, not freeze up,

121
00:07:48,853 --> 00:07:51,912
and be reliable
in carrying out operations

122
00:07:51,913 --> 00:07:53,998
that were basically irreversible.

123
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:57,883
When you fire a solid rocket motor,
that's irreversible; you can't undo it,

124
00:07:57,884 --> 00:08:01,472
so you must do it at the right time,
and in the right direction.

125
00:08:01,473 --> 00:08:04,310
So that was what I was doing
as a payload officer:

126
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:06,704
I was building up my resume
to become an astronaut.

127
00:08:09,386 --> 00:08:12,500
There were 
two astronaut selection periods

128
00:08:12,501 --> 00:08:15,625
before I was finally selected.

129
00:08:15,626 --> 00:08:18,875
In each of those I was interviewed,
but I was not good enough

130
00:08:18,876 --> 00:08:24,091
to make the final 20 or so,
15 or so astronauts

131
00:08:24,092 --> 00:08:26,026
that were selected.

132
00:08:26,027 --> 00:08:29,198
When I was 30 years old
it was 1987.

133
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:39,135
The Space Shuttle Challenger
blew up at the beginning of 1986.

134
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:42,957
It was a huge trauma for the United States
and maybe for the world,

135
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,875
because so many small children
were watching that launch

136
00:08:45,876 --> 00:08:48,835
because the first teacher,
Christa McAuliffe was flying on it.

137
00:08:50,195 --> 00:08:52,434
Nonetheless, in spite of that accident,

138
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:55,846
NASA regrouped, found out
what the problem was,

139
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:00,447
and corrected it, and during that time
it needed to select more astronauts,

140
00:09:00,448 --> 00:09:03,319
not just because astronauts had left
because of the accident

141
00:09:03,439 --> 00:09:05,953
but because time had passed.

142
00:09:05,954 --> 00:09:12,910
I was interviewed the third time in 1987

143
00:09:12,911 --> 00:09:15,645
and selected in August of that year

144
00:09:15,646 --> 00:09:18,831
and from that point onwards,
I had a career at NASA

145
00:09:18,832 --> 00:09:23,963
from 1987 until 2013
as a NASA astronaut.

146
00:09:30,125 --> 00:09:34,250
OK, GNC, Guidance Navigation and Control

147
00:09:35,109 --> 00:09:39,024
is the moniker by which,
at least in the Western world,

148
00:09:39,672 --> 00:09:42,833
we describe the spacecraft systems

149
00:09:42,834 --> 00:09:48,293
that are required to guide, i.e., control

150
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:53,434
a spacecraft in a specific direction
and at a specific speed.

151
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:56,525
That's the guidance part.

152
00:09:56,881 --> 00:10:00,477
Navigation is the means
by which as you do that,

153
00:10:00,478 --> 00:10:04,438
the spacecraft looks around
with its sensors

154
00:10:04,439 --> 00:10:08,363
and knows where it is at this moment

155
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:14,000
and knows where it needs to go
later on, where it's trying to get to,

156
00:10:14,001 --> 00:10:16,063
for example, geosynchronous orbit,

157
00:10:16,064 --> 00:10:18,636
and that navigation is done with sensors;

158
00:10:18,637 --> 00:10:23,721
and then control is the method
by which you actually move the spacecraft

159
00:10:24,466 --> 00:10:30,319
to achieve the convergence of the guidance
which is where we want to be;

160
00:10:30,478 --> 00:10:32,763
the navigation is where we are,

161
00:10:32,764 --> 00:10:35,936
and the control, it moves
rocket motors or thrusters

162
00:10:36,579 --> 00:10:43,067
to make the other two come together,
the guidance and the navigation.

163
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:48,515
We use the word "converge"
in the space business.

164
00:10:51,669 --> 00:10:55,870
In the Space Shuttle 
there are a number of sensors,

165
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,114
and I start with the sensors first

166
00:10:58,115 --> 00:11:03,207
before we go on to the guidance,
briefly, and then the control.

167
00:11:03,846 --> 00:11:08,846
The sensors on the Space Shuttle
for knowing where it is, are many.

168
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:14,291
There are 
three inertial measurement units.

169
00:11:14,736 --> 00:11:16,364
These basically consist

170
00:11:16,364 --> 00:11:22,198
of three individual gyroscopes and gimbals

171
00:11:23,429 --> 00:11:27,419
that originally were made
as mechanical gyroscopes,

172
00:11:27,419 --> 00:11:31,072
but were then subsequently replaced
with laser gyroscopes.

173
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:35,788
Those inertial measurement units
are able to detect

174
00:11:35,789 --> 00:11:39,750
absolute orientation of the Space Shuttle

175
00:11:39,751 --> 00:11:42,710
or of the box, the platform, the IMU,

176
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:44,619
relative to the stars.

177
00:11:45,001 --> 00:11:50,203
And they have to be aligned
to a specific set of stars

178
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:52,931
before you begin any navigation task.

179
00:11:53,490 --> 00:11:56,584
With the Space Shuttle,
that began on the launch pad,

180
00:11:56,585 --> 00:12:00,467
and the tail of the Space Shuttle
was pointed to due south.

181
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,479
They would align
the inertial measurement units

182
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,941
on the launchpad before liftoff.

183
00:12:09,616 --> 00:12:11,353
That was one set of equipment,

184
00:12:11,354 --> 00:12:13,555
and they are the key
by which the Space Shuttle

185
00:12:13,675 --> 00:12:16,231
knows which way it's pointing.

186
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:22,356
Next, in space, there's
another set of measurement units

187
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:25,860
that measure angular rates,
not just the angle that you are

188
00:12:25,861 --> 00:12:29,761
in terms of absolute space,
inertial space

189
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:33,473
but the rate 
at which the angles are changing.

190
00:12:33,884 --> 00:12:35,777
They are called <i>rate gyros</i>

191
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:39,431
and there were, I think, a set
of four of those on the Space Shuttle;

192
00:12:39,432 --> 00:12:41,489
some at the back end of the Space Shuttle

193
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,938
and some at the front end
of the Space Shuttle,

194
00:12:43,939 --> 00:12:48,862
because the Space Shuttle
was of the order of 50 meters long

195
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:53,273
and for that reason,
rates at one end of the vehicle

196
00:12:53,274 --> 00:12:55,402
might be different
from rates at the other

197
00:12:55,417 --> 00:12:58,792
due to flection
of the whole spacecraft structure.

198
00:12:58,793 --> 00:13:00,884
So, you have rate gyros as well.

199
00:13:03,119 --> 00:13:07,817
Once you're in orbit,
those inertial measurement units drift,

200
00:13:07,818 --> 00:13:13,828
and they have more and more error
relative to the inertial reference frame

201
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:16,120
that they were aligned
to on the launch pad.

202
00:13:16,728 --> 00:13:21,877
The way that they achieve realignment
of the inertial measurement units

203
00:13:21,878 --> 00:13:26,625
is to use two instruments
called star trackers

204
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:33,082
and one looked out the <i>+Y</i> axis
of the Space Shuttle,

205
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:38,500
and the other looked up
the <i>-Z</i> axis of the Space Shuttle.

206
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:44,797
Those are the sensors
on the Space Shuttle for navigation.

207
00:13:46,785 --> 00:13:49,876
Control: so how do you control this?

208
00:13:50,116 --> 00:13:53,137
That's a fairly obvious one
when you look at the Space Shuttle.

209
00:13:53,138 --> 00:13:57,486
The Space Shuttle is basically
a combination of aircraft and rocket.

210
00:13:58,149 --> 00:13:59,910
Let's talk about the rocket bit.

211
00:13:59,911 --> 00:14:04,205
The rocket control starts
with the three main engine bells

212
00:14:04,206 --> 00:14:09,853
that burn cryogenic oxygen and hydrogen
at the bottom of the shuttle,

213
00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:12,790
and they can vector in two planes,

214
00:14:14,448 --> 00:14:16,861
and you call that thrust vector control

215
00:14:16,862 --> 00:14:21,374
of each individual engine nozzle,
or engine bell.

216
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,542
You can see them
like a bell, like a <i>cupula</i>.

217
00:14:24,542 --> 00:14:30,751
The solid rocket boosters also could
gimbal their nozzles in two planes,

218
00:14:32,216 --> 00:14:36,329
and with a combination of the two
solid rocket boosters on either side

219
00:14:36,334 --> 00:14:38,501
gimbaling their thrust back to control

220
00:14:38,504 --> 00:14:40,555
as well as the three main engines,

221
00:14:40,989 --> 00:14:44,215
you can control the attitude
of the Space Shuttle

222
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:49,127
in all three directions:
pitch, roll, and yaw during launch.

223
00:14:51,073 --> 00:14:56,088
In addition, once the solid rocket
boosters have come off,

224
00:14:56,089 --> 00:14:59,373
and once the main engines
of the Space Shuttle

225
00:14:59,374 --> 00:15:03,751
have ceased operating
and you're in space, in orbit,

226
00:15:05,231 --> 00:15:08,721
then there are two additional systems

227
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:11,830
that can be used
to control the spacecraft.

228
00:15:12,981 --> 00:15:18,652
One of them are two larger engine bells

229
00:15:19,403 --> 00:15:23,302
than the reaction control system,
which are small, little rocket motors.

230
00:15:23,951 --> 00:15:27,014
The larger engine bells
that are on the back of the Space Shuttle

231
00:15:27,134 --> 00:15:29,356
called the <i>Orbital Maneuvering System</i>.

232
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,672
They used hydrazine
and nitrogen tetroxide propellants

233
00:15:33,673 --> 00:15:39,300
to fire briefly to change the orbit
of the Space Shuttle up or down

234
00:15:39,301 --> 00:15:42,126
in apogee and perigee,

235
00:15:42,127 --> 00:15:47,373
and also, most importantly, to provide
the impulse to deal with the Space Shuttle

236
00:15:47,374 --> 00:15:52,145
to bring it back into the atmosphere
so that it can return to our landing site.

237
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:55,811
Those are called
the <i>OMS Maneuvering System</i>.

238
00:15:55,812 --> 00:15:58,751
They also gimballed in two planes each.

239
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:05,272
Then the fine control--
and this is the way most satellites work,

240
00:16:05,273 --> 00:16:09,810
and it's the one that's used the most--
are the reaction control system jets

241
00:16:09,811 --> 00:16:13,432
and they were each roughly 400 kilos,

242
00:16:13,433 --> 00:16:18,118
4,000 Newtons or so of thrust,

243
00:16:18,536 --> 00:16:23,730
and they were spaced there,
like 12 or 16 of these,

244
00:16:23,731 --> 00:16:27,871
spaced at different points
around the Space Shuttle

245
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:32,319
to control translation and rotation
in three planes.

246
00:16:32,903 --> 00:16:36,347
Those are the effectors of the GNC system.

247
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,626
I've talked to you about
navigation, the sensors,

248
00:16:39,627 --> 00:16:42,812
I've talked about
the control system, the effectors.

249
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:45,544
Now, how does it all get put together?

250
00:16:45,545 --> 00:16:48,572
That is a software algorithm task.

251
00:16:48,573 --> 00:16:51,634
It uses the knowledge of orbital mechanics

252
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:55,076
and takes into account
the mission parameter,

253
00:16:55,077 --> 00:16:56,840
which is, for example,

254
00:16:56,841 --> 00:17:00,578
if you want to get to orbit
to the International Space Station,

255
00:17:00,579 --> 00:17:05,346
you need to get to an altitude
above the Earth of 400 kilometers,

256
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:10,104
and so, knowing that altitude,

257
00:17:11,021 --> 00:17:15,758
there's a sophisticated calculation

258
00:17:15,759 --> 00:17:20,617
using the four general purpose
computers of the Space Shuttle

259
00:17:21,356 --> 00:17:25,791
to calculate what control is required
based on the navigation

260
00:17:25,792 --> 00:17:27,542
to get to that point.

261
00:17:28,415 --> 00:17:34,387
The final part
of Guidance Navigation Control

262
00:17:34,388 --> 00:17:37,481
is, of course, when the Space Shuttle
acts as an airplane.

263
00:17:38,447 --> 00:17:43,619
After guidance has told control,

264
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:46,619
"Get me into the atmosphere,"

265
00:17:47,336 --> 00:17:51,771
at what we call a minimum safe perigee--

266
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:56,328
Actually, the Space Shuttle
used Imperial units,

267
00:17:56,329 --> 00:18:02,745
and we used 400,000 feet
as the height above the Earth

268
00:18:03,467 --> 00:18:08,245
at which the Space Shuttle
had entered the atmosphere.

269
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,240
That was called entry interphase.

270
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:14,429
From that moment on, a combination
of Reaction Control System jets

271
00:18:15,292 --> 00:18:20,793
as well as the elevons,
the ailerons that act also as elevons

272
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:24,738
in the delta plane wing
of the Space Shuttle,

273
00:18:24,739 --> 00:18:26,567
as well as the rudder,

274
00:18:26,568 --> 00:18:29,764
they would act to control
the attitude of the Space Shuttle

275
00:18:29,765 --> 00:18:34,585
to be about 40º of angle of attack, <i>α</i>,

276
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:40,610
as it bled off the energy
of eight kilometers per second,

277
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:45,245
slowed down, and decelerated
coming into the atmosphere.

278
00:18:45,246 --> 00:18:50,864
All of that control was provided initially
by Reaction Control System jets

279
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:56,379
and then there was a general blending
of Reaction Control System

280
00:18:56,380 --> 00:19:01,082
plus control surface effectors

281
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:06,488
to change and effect 
the attitude of the Space Shuttle

282
00:19:06,489 --> 00:19:08,996
as it came into the atmosphere.

283
00:19:08,997 --> 00:19:11,932
To decelerate
from eight kilometers per second

284
00:19:11,933 --> 00:19:17,879
down to 200 knots landing
out at the Kennedy Space Center,

285
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:21,303
the Space Shuttle took about 20 minutes

286
00:19:21,304 --> 00:19:27,096
of continuous 1.5 to 2 Gs
of deceleration coming in,

287
00:19:27,097 --> 00:19:31,411
initially, with this 40º angle of attack,

288
00:19:31,412 --> 00:19:36,919
but putting in banks so that you fly
one way for about five minutes,

289
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:40,105
and then you do an <i>S-turn</i>
and fly the other way

290
00:19:40,106 --> 00:19:41,889
for about five minutes.

291
00:19:42,328 --> 00:19:45,259
These S-turns were called
<i>hypersonic S-turns</i>

292
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:48,657
and it was a way of keeping you going,
basically, in a straight line

293
00:19:48,658 --> 00:19:52,118
over about a quarter of the Earth
during this period,

294
00:19:52,119 --> 00:19:55,653
a quarter to a half of the Earth
we're covering as we do this.

295
00:19:55,654 --> 00:19:59,422
We come over the Earth, and we finally
make it to the landing point.

296
00:19:59,423 --> 00:20:03,019
And of course, as we slow down
and come over the Kennedy Space Center

297
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:09,912
at roughly Mach 2.5,
two and a half times the speed of sound,

298
00:20:10,298 --> 00:20:14,024
then the control surfaces
take over completely,

299
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:20,405
and the Space Shuttle behaves very much
like an aircraft that a pilot is used to.

300
00:20:21,527 --> 00:20:25,133
From that point onwards,
the pilot can fly it normally,

301
00:20:26,138 --> 00:20:29,383
but knowing that they don't have
an engine to go around,

302
00:20:29,384 --> 00:20:31,150
so they have to manage their energy.

303
00:20:31,648 --> 00:20:35,253
That's the kinetic energy plus
the potential energy, the height energy

304
00:20:35,254 --> 00:20:38,793
so that they can be sure
of making the runway and landing.

305
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,809
That's a rather brief story, actually,

306
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:45,569
about Guidance Navigation and Control
of the Space Shuttle.

307
00:20:58,745 --> 00:21:01,657
Well, Claude is a dear friend,

308
00:21:01,658 --> 00:21:05,746
and it's because we shared an office,

309
00:21:05,747 --> 00:21:10,672
and we trained for more than a year

310
00:21:10,673 --> 00:21:13,178
in the water tank
at the Johnson Space Center

311
00:21:13,179 --> 00:21:15,435
called the Neutral Buoyancy Lab,

312
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:20,298
and the only way we can simulate
doing a spacewalk

313
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:24,192
to repair the Space Telescope Hubble

314
00:21:24,193 --> 00:21:27,824
is, of course, to do work in a space suit

315
00:21:27,825 --> 00:21:29,935
with the tools that you're going to use,

316
00:21:29,936 --> 00:21:32,194
and we have to do that underwater,

317
00:21:32,195 --> 00:21:34,083
where we're neutrally buoyant.

318
00:21:34,774 --> 00:21:37,715
Claude and I were a team.

319
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:42,422
There were two pairs
of space-walking astronauts

320
00:21:42,423 --> 00:21:48,956
on my mission, STS-103 with Claude,
and Claude and I were the second team.

321
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:53,041
There was Steve Smith
and John Grunsfeld on the first team,

322
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:56,549
and they did the very first
space walk of that mission

323
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:58,879
to replace gyroscopes,

324
00:21:59,769 --> 00:22:02,349
where they opened up
the Space Telescope's doors,

325
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:04,823
went inside, and removed the boxes,

326
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:08,109
the rate gyroscopes.
There are six of them.

327
00:22:09,683 --> 00:22:15,481
Claude and I, the next day,
had to go out and we had two tasks:

328
00:22:15,482 --> 00:22:20,053
one was to replace--
and this was primarily my task--

329
00:22:20,054 --> 00:22:25,490
was to replace a 386 computer
that ran the telescope

330
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:28,162
with a 486 computer,

331
00:22:28,163 --> 00:22:29,802
so at that point,

332
00:22:29,802 --> 00:22:36,032
Claude basically would help me
retrieve tools on a tool station

333
00:22:36,463 --> 00:22:39,894
and I was on the end of an arm,
the Space Shuttle arm,

334
00:22:39,895 --> 00:22:45,767
up high above the cargo bay
with the door to the computer bay

335
00:22:46,479 --> 00:22:50,009
open on the telescope
and high, up above the Space Shuttle.

336
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,520
It's a great place to be!

337
00:22:51,775 --> 00:22:53,581
Claude would float next to me

338
00:22:53,582 --> 00:22:57,108
and this was in the beginning part
of that space walk.

339
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,723
We were both nervous, of course,

340
00:22:59,724 --> 00:23:02,115
that we wouldn't do our tasks properly

341
00:23:02,116 --> 00:23:04,523
even though we trained for a year together

342
00:23:04,524 --> 00:23:07,772
and knew each other's tasks
really, really well.

343
00:23:07,773 --> 00:23:09,546
Nonetheless, we were both nervous,

344
00:23:09,547 --> 00:23:14,953
and so, I was very, very tense
about this task

345
00:23:14,954 --> 00:23:20,776
and for the first hour or two 
I think we weren't joking,

346
00:23:20,777 --> 00:23:24,724
we weren't really relaxed so much

347
00:23:26,251 --> 00:23:28,564
so Claude would pass me the tools,

348
00:23:28,565 --> 00:23:33,428
I would reach in under the cables
and set up this computer.

349
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:37,021
Once I had that job done
and the ground told me,

350
00:23:37,022 --> 00:23:42,006
"We're going to boot up the computer,
power it up, please stand clear,"

351
00:23:42,007 --> 00:23:43,286
(laughter)

352
00:23:43,287 --> 00:23:45,536
not that a computer
is going to jump out at you,

353
00:23:46,404 --> 00:23:50,184
and then they told me that it was actually
booting up properly and successfully.

354
00:23:50,535 --> 00:23:53,701
I knew that I hadn't
really done anything bad

355
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:58,841
to the connectors and all the gold pins
of the connectors behind the box

356
00:23:58,842 --> 00:24:02,993
that I was manipulating
with my space suit gloves,

357
00:24:02,994 --> 00:24:05,365
so I suddenly felt very, very relaxed

358
00:24:05,366 --> 00:24:07,172
and in fact, tears came into my eyes

359
00:24:07,173 --> 00:24:09,422
and even in the space suit,
I couldn't wipe away

360
00:24:09,422 --> 00:24:10,955
because I had the helmet there,

361
00:24:10,955 --> 00:24:13,379
that I hadn't broken
the telescope forever.

362
00:24:14,507 --> 00:24:17,573
In fact, I improved it
by putting a computer in.

363
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:22,020
So now it's Claude's turn to be on point.

364
00:24:22,021 --> 00:24:24,432
Claude's task now was coming up.

365
00:24:24,433 --> 00:24:27,100
His job, and I'm sure
you've heard this from Claude,

366
00:24:27,101 --> 00:24:30,549
was to replace the fine guidance sensor
of the telescope.

367
00:24:30,550 --> 00:24:34,821
It was a baby piano sized box
that you have to slide in.

368
00:24:35,742 --> 00:24:40,707
My task now is to be
the floating astronaut off to the side

369
00:24:40,708 --> 00:24:44,441
while Claude is on the arm,
coming into the telescope

370
00:24:44,442 --> 00:24:47,406
with this big box,
which he couldn't see around.

371
00:24:47,407 --> 00:24:50,197
He's just got a great big wall
in front of him.

372
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:52,227
At least that's the way it looked to me.

373
00:24:52,228 --> 00:24:56,124
He's on the arm,
and he's giving instructions

374
00:24:56,125 --> 00:25:01,834
to Jean-François Clervoy,
a European astronaut from France

375
00:25:01,853 --> 00:25:04,529
who was operating the arm controls

376
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:07,675
from within the cockpit
of the Space Shuttle

377
00:25:07,676 --> 00:25:14,022
and Claude says, "OK, Jean-François,
bring me in three centimeters,

378
00:25:14,023 --> 00:25:18,526
up ten centimeters,
left a bit, right a bit, etc.

379
00:25:18,527 --> 00:25:24,285
as he brings this baby piano sized
Fine Guidance Sensor box

380
00:25:24,286 --> 00:25:26,097
into the telescope.

381
00:25:26,742 --> 00:25:31,837
There are two rails
that lead into the telescope

382
00:25:31,838 --> 00:25:35,565
and that the box,
the Fine Guidance Sensor,

383
00:25:35,566 --> 00:25:38,275
has to engage
with two little rotor wheels,

384
00:25:38,276 --> 00:25:41,517
or slide, I don't remember
if they're wheels or just a slide.

385
00:25:42,127 --> 00:25:44,989
I think it was just a slide,
so he had to come into that

386
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,901
and this box is about two meters long

387
00:25:48,902 --> 00:25:51,173
in front of Claude,
so he can't see anything.

388
00:25:51,174 --> 00:25:53,718
It's like moving a great big wall,

389
00:25:53,719 --> 00:25:59,484
and I'm on the side, looking
perpendicular to that motion

390
00:25:59,485 --> 00:26:02,179
as it comes to the telescope, saying,

391
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,143
"Claude, it's looking good!
I think maybe you're a bit low,

392
00:26:05,144 --> 00:26:06,635
you need to come up a bit."

393
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:10,500
There's two ways
that Claude can come up a bit.

394
00:26:10,501 --> 00:26:13,358
He can either move his arms up

395
00:26:13,359 --> 00:26:16,165
to move the Fine Guidance Sensor up,

396
00:26:16,166 --> 00:26:19,382
or he can ask Jean-François Clervoy,

397
00:26:19,383 --> 00:26:23,600
in the cockpit, to move the arm up

398
00:26:23,601 --> 00:26:26,623
so he had to make the decision what to do.

399
00:26:27,215 --> 00:26:30,230
I would give advice, but he had 
to make the decision what to do.

400
00:26:31,430 --> 00:26:36,552
So we're both working
on this two billion dollar telescope,

401
00:26:36,969 --> 00:26:39,897
and Claude's a <i>real</i> astronomer;

402
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:42,291
he doesn't want to be known
for breaking it either.

403
00:26:42,411 --> 00:26:43,517
I was just as nervous,

404
00:26:43,517 --> 00:26:48,479
and he gets in about halfway, 
if I remember right, with the box.

405
00:26:48,525 --> 00:26:50,735
Then he gets stuck.

406
00:26:51,525 --> 00:26:57,635
And Claude said something like--
I can't remember what it was,

407
00:26:57,636 --> 00:27:00,369
but I remember what I thought.
I thought, "It's stuck!"

408
00:27:01,159 --> 00:27:03,849
And I thought, "Oh, this is terrible!"

409
00:27:03,850 --> 00:27:10,084
And he pushes and he pushes, and I said,
"Claude, it looks like it's stuck."

410
00:27:10,085 --> 00:27:12,375
And he goes, "Yes" or something like that,

411
00:27:13,061 --> 00:27:18,541
and we start to suddenly feel less relaxed
and very tense about this,

412
00:27:18,541 --> 00:27:23,320
because we know this could be
a huge problem with the telescope.

413
00:27:23,321 --> 00:27:27,272
So the obvious thing to do,
and Claude decided this,

414
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:30,396
was to come back out from the telescope

415
00:27:30,397 --> 00:27:33,813
and try and start this motion over again.

416
00:27:33,814 --> 00:27:38,133
What had happened was
that it was on rails,

417
00:27:38,134 --> 00:27:41,603
and you need to come in
straight along the ruler here,

418
00:27:41,604 --> 00:27:45,856
but the ruler was--
he was coming in like that, at an angle.

419
00:27:46,201 --> 00:27:48,783
He was a bit too low if I remember right

420
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:55,156
and so coming in at an angle,
and basically, the box was getting bound

421
00:27:55,157 --> 00:27:57,051
coming into the telescope.

422
00:27:57,052 --> 00:27:59,181
So we had a discussion, Claude and I

423
00:27:59,182 --> 00:28:01,913
about did he think
he was in the right position?

424
00:28:01,914 --> 00:28:04,450
He thought he was,
based on all the training we'd had.

425
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:08,231
He thought he was at the right height
above the cargo bay,

426
00:28:08,232 --> 00:28:11,967
but to me, floating on the side,
it looked like he was very slightly low.

427
00:28:12,950 --> 00:28:18,889
Lower where he was, compared
to where the box was going into.

428
00:28:19,936 --> 00:28:23,558
The answer, I thought,
was to come up a bit,

429
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:26,246
so I suggested that to Claude,

430
00:28:26,247 --> 00:28:33,292
and I think Claude told Jean-François
to lift him up maybe 10 or 20 centimeters,

431
00:28:34,167 --> 00:28:37,709
and then Claude said, "OK,
I'm going to start coming in again."

432
00:28:37,714 --> 00:28:42,828
At that point, the box
just drifted in perfectly, smoothly,

433
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:44,574
and went all the way to the stops,

434
00:28:44,575 --> 00:28:47,467
and Claude was able to finish the task.

435
00:28:48,193 --> 00:28:54,291
So that wasn't a funny story,
but it's the most memorable story I have

436
00:28:54,292 --> 00:28:58,168
of Claude Nicollier, and he was
calm and cool throughout all of this.

437
00:28:58,169 --> 00:29:00,635
In fact, I think all of us were,

438
00:29:00,636 --> 00:29:04,344
but within our-- (chuckles)

439
00:29:04,344 --> 00:29:06,094
The little voice inside us was saying,

440
00:29:06,094 --> 00:29:09,259
"This could be really bad
if we don't fix this!"

441
00:29:14,995 --> 00:29:21,517
The Hubble mission with Claude Nicollier
was in 1999, but before that,

442
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:26,894
I was launched to the Space Station Mir,

443
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:29,090
a Russian space station 
that's not there anymore,

444
00:29:29,091 --> 00:29:30,271
in space,

445
00:29:31,011 --> 00:29:32,321
in 1997,

446
00:29:33,411 --> 00:29:37,981
and I was the fifth astronaut
in a series of seven astronauts

447
00:29:37,981 --> 00:29:40,344
to be, basically, a guest

448
00:29:40,345 --> 00:29:43,082
on the Russian Space Station Mir,

449
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:50,049
carrying out a number 
of very small, low budget experiments

450
00:29:51,314 --> 00:29:55,481
in one or two of the Mir modules
that were there.

451
00:29:59,577 --> 00:30:02,668
It wasn't like a Hubble repair mission.

452
00:30:02,669 --> 00:30:06,702
It wasn't like deploying a satellite
out of the cargo bay of the Shuttle.

453
00:30:06,703 --> 00:30:09,686
It was really pure laboratory science

454
00:30:09,687 --> 00:30:11,637
that was the goal of the mission.

455
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,751
The goal of the mission was 
for me to do the experiments

456
00:30:15,752 --> 00:30:18,228
to get along with my Russian crew,

457
00:30:18,889 --> 00:30:21,552
not to cause any problems
with my Russian crew

458
00:30:21,552 --> 00:30:25,996
by embarrassing them, breaking them,
breaking something, or whatever,

459
00:30:25,997 --> 00:30:31,595
and basically allowing as much
me interacting with my Russian crew mates

460
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:35,197
as letting the American controllers
in Moscow

461
00:30:35,198 --> 00:30:38,983
get to know Russian controllers in Moscow

462
00:30:38,984 --> 00:30:44,054
managing our joint experiment
program activities.

463
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:47,252
So that was the whole point
of this Mir mission.

464
00:30:48,549 --> 00:30:51,605
I was to be there for four months.

465
00:30:51,606 --> 00:30:57,238
I was launched, I think, in May of 1997

466
00:30:58,242 --> 00:31:02,972
and came back from Mir in October of 1997.

467
00:31:04,142 --> 00:31:06,844
I was there for almost five months.

468
00:31:06,845 --> 00:31:10,833
Each day, I would get up,
out of my sleeping bag,

469
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:14,040
brush your teeth, etcetera, do
all those things that you have to do,

470
00:31:14,328 --> 00:31:19,747
and then I'd go and read the mail.

471
00:31:19,748 --> 00:31:22,336
Actually, I would receive the email,

472
00:31:22,822 --> 00:31:26,124
and it wasn't email in those days.
It was a form of telegraphy.

473
00:31:26,125 --> 00:31:29,511
Not quite Morse code, but very similar,

474
00:31:29,512 --> 00:31:32,826
where we would receive files from Moscow,

475
00:31:32,827 --> 00:31:37,042
and I would get those files
off of a laptop computer

476
00:31:37,043 --> 00:31:39,975
and using a radio ham modem,

477
00:31:39,976 --> 00:31:41,702
and that's what the Russians used.

478
00:31:41,702 --> 00:31:46,426
They adapted a modem for radio hams
to send text files out.

479
00:31:46,987 --> 00:31:50,210
I would get these text files
that were written in Russian

480
00:31:50,211 --> 00:31:53,598
on a DOS operating system laptop,

481
00:31:53,599 --> 00:31:57,583
and then I would print them out
and give them to the crew members,

482
00:31:57,584 --> 00:31:58,984
Vasily and Sasha,

483
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:03,157
and they would then read them and say,
"These are our instructions for the day."

484
00:32:03,158 --> 00:32:05,502
At the same time,
I got my instructions that way,

485
00:32:05,503 --> 00:32:11,220
but my role in that crew was to act
as the communications officer,

486
00:32:11,221 --> 00:32:13,006
getting the mail.

487
00:32:13,709 --> 00:32:16,657
Then I'd read my mail and it would say,

488
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:21,917
"Go and operate the SVET greenhouse."

489
00:32:22,264 --> 00:32:24,670
This was a greenhouse that grew plants,

490
00:32:24,671 --> 00:32:28,533
and I had to put the seeds
into the seed trays,

491
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:32,677
make sure that they didn't float off
through the fan of the greenhouse

492
00:32:32,678 --> 00:32:38,512
and grow plants that looked
a bit like the vegetable broccoli.

493
00:32:38,513 --> 00:32:40,135
In fact, they would flower,

494
00:32:40,135 --> 00:32:42,887
and I would have to collect
the pollen with bee sticks

495
00:32:42,887 --> 00:32:44,547
and then take the pollen

496
00:32:44,547 --> 00:32:49,103
and fertilize the flowers

497
00:32:49,103 --> 00:32:52,663
with those bee sticks

498
00:32:52,663 --> 00:32:55,792
so that they would then produce seed
and produce another generation of seed,

499
00:32:55,792 --> 00:32:57,538
so that was an interesting experiment.

500
00:32:57,539 --> 00:33:02,489
I had an experiment then
that I would go off with beetles in it,

501
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:04,490
and it was a beetle experiment.

502
00:33:04,491 --> 00:33:08,935
These beetles were great, big things,
about this size, that came from Kazakhstan

503
00:33:08,936 --> 00:33:10,933
and they had a circadian rhythm

504
00:33:10,934 --> 00:33:16,881
that seemed to stay locked in step
with Kazakhstan's local time of day

505
00:33:16,882 --> 00:33:20,910
even though they were in space,
in orbit around the Earth

506
00:33:20,911 --> 00:33:23,194
and going around the Earth
every 90 minutes.

507
00:33:23,195 --> 00:33:24,936
Amazing creatures.

508
00:33:26,138 --> 00:33:29,722
Then, in the evening,
amongst those activities,

509
00:33:29,723 --> 00:33:31,949
we had to do exercise.

510
00:33:31,949 --> 00:33:33,749
There were two treadmills on the Mir,

511
00:33:35,859 --> 00:33:37,850
and rubber bungees as well.

512
00:33:38,469 --> 00:33:42,476
All of us, the whole crew 
were expected to exercise

513
00:33:42,476 --> 00:33:47,004
for about an hour each session
up to twice a day.

514
00:33:47,005 --> 00:33:49,446
When you exercise in space,
you've got all this sweat,

515
00:33:49,566 --> 00:33:52,137
and it pours bubbles on you,

516
00:33:52,138 --> 00:33:55,147
so you have to get cleaned up
from all that sweat.

517
00:33:55,148 --> 00:33:57,272
It doesn't run off,

518
00:33:57,273 --> 00:34:00,522
and that takes another hour
or so to clean up.

519
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:05,291
So, exercise could take
up to three hours out of the work day,

520
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:09,022
leaving you about the five or six
for the experiments that you're tending.

521
00:34:16,135 --> 00:34:18,766
The big difference between
the Space Shuttle and the Mir

522
00:34:18,887 --> 00:34:21,998
was that the Space Shuttle was like

523
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:27,918
a very well scripted,
choreographed mission

524
00:34:28,632 --> 00:34:32,802
where you know pretty much every day
what you have to do,

525
00:34:32,803 --> 00:34:36,440
and you have very specific sequences,
all of which you practiced,

526
00:34:37,246 --> 00:34:41,284
because the Space Shuttle mission
just doesn't go on longer than ten days,

527
00:34:41,985 --> 00:34:44,676
because it can't stay up
longer than that on its own.

528
00:34:44,677 --> 00:34:48,538
On the Mir, or on
the International Space Station,

529
00:34:48,539 --> 00:34:54,196
the experiments have results,
and what you do

530
00:34:54,197 --> 00:34:56,878
based on the experiment result
may be different.

531
00:34:57,846 --> 00:35:00,101
So, you don't train
for all of those results,

532
00:35:00,102 --> 00:35:02,167
and sometimes there'll be a pause,

533
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:04,917
and the investigators who are responsible

534
00:35:04,918 --> 00:35:07,460
and who own those experiments
on the ground will say,

535
00:35:07,461 --> 00:35:11,905
"Michael, we're not going to have you
work on the greenhouse today.

536
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:17,219
We're going to have you work
with growing colloids in space."

537
00:35:17,834 --> 00:35:19,460
And you go, "OK."

538
00:35:19,474 --> 00:35:25,552
It's very flexible, much more like coming
to the office, coming to the laboratory

539
00:35:25,553 --> 00:35:31,207
type of job where you didn't really know
what was coming up the next week

540
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:33,861
because it depended,
really, on the priorities

541
00:35:33,862 --> 00:35:36,431
of what was going on
this week on the station.

542
00:35:36,432 --> 00:35:41,098
Then, of course, the equipment breaks
or cargo ships arrive,

543
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:46,242
or emergencies happen
that can change your day.

544
00:35:46,265 --> 00:35:49,065
And so that's the difference in character

545
00:35:49,066 --> 00:35:52,115
between a space station,
a long duration mission,

546
00:35:52,116 --> 00:35:56,762
and a short, directed, focused
Space Shuttle mission.

547
00:36:02,971 --> 00:36:06,349
On the Mir space station, 
this was the very first interaction

548
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:10,964
of American astronauts
with Russian cosmonauts

549
00:36:10,965 --> 00:36:17,464
since the Apollo-Soyuz
joint docking program

550
00:36:17,464 --> 00:36:19,278
in 1975,

551
00:36:19,278 --> 00:36:22,091
which is when I was still
in university-- actually, school.

552
00:36:23,987 --> 00:36:29,116
This is a big deal
for Americans and Russians.

553
00:36:29,117 --> 00:36:31,031
It was the end of the Cold War,

554
00:36:31,032 --> 00:36:33,837
and it was a way 
by which Americans and Russians

555
00:36:33,838 --> 00:36:36,826
could show they were working
together in space.

556
00:36:36,905 --> 00:36:42,502
Nonetheless, that meant the Russians
had had no experience speaking English,

557
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:45,646
and it meant that Americans,
including Michael Foale,

558
00:36:45,647 --> 00:36:48,604
had no experience speaking Russian.

559
00:36:48,605 --> 00:36:51,510
The biggest challenge for me

560
00:36:52,456 --> 00:36:56,240
and the other American astronauts
who were sent to Mir

561
00:36:56,241 --> 00:36:58,200
was to learn the Russian language,

562
00:36:58,201 --> 00:37:00,034
because the Mir was already built.

563
00:37:00,035 --> 00:37:05,587
There were no labels on the equipment
in Russian and English

564
00:37:05,588 --> 00:37:08,042
like there are on
the International Space Station.

565
00:37:08,441 --> 00:37:11,122
On Mir, they were all in Russian,

566
00:37:11,123 --> 00:37:13,437
so all of us had to learn Russian.

567
00:37:13,438 --> 00:37:15,879
We went through intensive
Russian language training.

568
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:21,196
It took, probably, three months
of dedicated eight hours a day,

569
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:24,053
one on one Russian language training,

570
00:37:24,054 --> 00:37:28,406
before the Russians in Star City,
where I was living with my family,

571
00:37:28,407 --> 00:37:31,513
said we are ready now
to have lectures in Russian.

572
00:37:31,910 --> 00:37:36,899
So because of that extra training
that I received in learning Russian,

573
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:39,989
Russian cosmonauts didn't have
any extra training

574
00:37:39,989 --> 00:37:41,641
to learn English at that point.

575
00:37:41,641 --> 00:37:44,443
They do now, going to 
the International Space Station.

576
00:37:45,088 --> 00:37:50,616
So when I meet cosmonauts
today in America, in Houston,

577
00:37:50,617 --> 00:37:53,680
and they're young cosmonauts
and they're trying to learn English,

578
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:57,443
I know I can talk to them in Russian,
but I don't; I let them speak English

579
00:37:57,444 --> 00:38:00,460
because I remember what Sasha said to me.

580
00:38:06,391 --> 00:38:11,339
All of the communications on the Mir
went through Moscow, in general.

581
00:38:11,992 --> 00:38:15,268
For emergencies, there were
two ground stations

582
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:17,908
set up in the United States

583
00:38:17,909 --> 00:38:22,513
that would allow us to talk
to Americans, basically,

584
00:38:22,514 --> 00:38:24,542
for about ten minutes.

585
00:38:24,543 --> 00:38:26,596
They were sometimes scheduled,

586
00:38:26,597 --> 00:38:30,513
but most of the time, all of it
went through ground stations

587
00:38:30,514 --> 00:38:33,701
over the Russian territories,

588
00:38:34,213 --> 00:38:38,014
and were funneled up through Moscow

589
00:38:38,015 --> 00:38:41,298
and we called it "Glavnyi Operator",

590
00:38:41,299 --> 00:38:42,960
which is like a CAPCOM.

591
00:38:59,232 --> 00:39:04,067
The collision of the cargo spacecraft
took place about six weeks

592
00:39:04,068 --> 00:39:10,848
into this four and a half month
stay of mine on the Space Station MIR,

593
00:39:11,908 --> 00:39:16,069
and the reasons for it
are a different story,

594
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:22,439
but the result was
that it hit the Space Station Mir

595
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,648
so that it actually went out of attitude.

596
00:39:25,649 --> 00:39:31,360
In fact, it was out of attitude
for normal solar power collection

597
00:39:31,361 --> 00:39:38,119
to enable the docking of the cargo ship
in a proper direction.

598
00:39:41,351 --> 00:39:46,121
Once the collision had taken place,
the Space Station tumbled,

599
00:39:46,122 --> 00:39:49,182
and as it tumbles, as it moves,

600
00:39:49,183 --> 00:39:51,624
its solar arrays no longer
point towards the Sun

601
00:39:51,625 --> 00:39:55,196
so if the Sun's over
here and it's tumbling,

602
00:39:55,197 --> 00:39:58,035
the solar array can't see the Sun anymore,

603
00:39:58,036 --> 00:40:03,981
and the electric power of the station
basically went to zero,

604
00:40:03,982 --> 00:40:06,400
and all we were left with
were the batteries.

605
00:40:06,401 --> 00:40:09,261
Well, the batteries there only had

606
00:40:09,262 --> 00:40:14,157
enough capacity for about
one and a half orbits,

607
00:40:14,158 --> 00:40:17,073
about two hours, and then you're done.

608
00:40:17,074 --> 00:40:19,351
You've got no more power on the station.

609
00:40:19,352 --> 00:40:22,267
So the immediate consequence
of the collision

610
00:40:22,268 --> 00:40:27,733
was that we'd lost all electrical power.

611
00:40:27,734 --> 00:40:31,041
All of the fans, I mean,
to you as an astronaut

612
00:40:31,042 --> 00:40:32,668
or a cosmonaut onboard,

613
00:40:32,705 --> 00:40:35,059
the first thing you notice
is the lights go off.

614
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:36,424
(laughter)

615
00:40:36,425 --> 00:40:38,132
And you also notice something,

616
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:41,051
the set, it becomes really, really quiet,

617
00:40:41,489 --> 00:40:43,553
and that's because all of the fans,

618
00:40:43,554 --> 00:40:45,976
and there are fans
everywhere on the spacecraft

619
00:40:45,977 --> 00:40:51,309
moving air around so that carbon dioxide
doesn't accumulate and suffocate you,

620
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:53,942
and also brings fresh oxygen
so that you can breathe it.

621
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:56,884
Those fans that are always
humming and whirring,

622
00:40:56,885 --> 00:41:00,154
they're just like computer fans
if you've listened to your computer.

623
00:41:00,155 --> 00:41:02,501
They all went and stopped,

624
00:41:02,502 --> 00:41:06,207
so it was absolutely silent, and dark.

625
00:41:07,054 --> 00:41:09,773
Then, as we go around the Earth
every 90 minutes

626
00:41:09,774 --> 00:41:15,037
and the dark-- the night pass
can be about 30 minutes long,

627
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:18,416
you go into the dark side of the Earth,

628
00:41:18,417 --> 00:41:23,291
and it starts to get cold
because there's no heat

629
00:41:23,292 --> 00:41:28,001
and the temperature of space
around the Earth is about -150º C,

630
00:41:28,912 --> 00:41:32,471
so the space station
is getting really, really cold.

631
00:41:32,472 --> 00:41:35,005
So it's cold, quiet, and dark.

632
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:37,184
That's the consequence
to you as an astronaut.

633
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,859
From a recovery point of view,

634
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:44,760
our task was to try
and get electrical power

635
00:41:44,761 --> 00:41:46,797
and of course, 
we can't talk to the ground,

636
00:41:46,798 --> 00:41:48,513
and the ground can't talk to us,

637
00:41:48,514 --> 00:41:50,237
because there's no electrical power.

638
00:41:50,918 --> 00:41:52,525
So our task was,

639
00:41:52,525 --> 00:41:57,655
and this is what Sasha, and myself,
and Vasily Tsibliyev did,

640
00:41:57,655 --> 00:41:59,377
Sasha Lazutkin I mentioned;

641
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:07,034
we came up with a scheme to do something
that had never been done

642
00:42:07,035 --> 00:42:11,171
before with the Mir station
in that configuration,

643
00:42:11,923 --> 00:42:16,515
which was to try and disconnect
the electrical power

644
00:42:16,516 --> 00:42:22,106
of the Soyuz lifeboat spacecraft
from the Mir space station,

645
00:42:22,107 --> 00:42:24,978
disconnect its power,
so that we could turn its batteries on.

646
00:42:26,235 --> 00:42:29,772
That took about two orbits,
about three hours

647
00:42:29,773 --> 00:42:30,873
(laughter)

648
00:42:30,874 --> 00:42:37,738
and once we got that achieved,
we then turned the Soyuz spacecraft on,

649
00:42:38,417 --> 00:42:40,069
using its batteries.

650
00:42:40,948 --> 00:42:44,846
And fire and disconnect its guidance,
navigation, and control system,

651
00:42:45,625 --> 00:42:47,867
which thought, "Hey, I'm a little Soyuz.

652
00:42:47,868 --> 00:42:51,156
"I'm nimble and I expect 
that when I fire my thruster this way,

653
00:42:51,157 --> 00:42:53,018
I'll get this much angular rate."

654
00:42:53,019 --> 00:42:55,526
All this had to be
disconnected in the Soyuz

655
00:42:55,527 --> 00:43:00,680
because we had the Mir space station
which weighs 100 tons attached to it,

656
00:43:00,681 --> 00:43:04,057
but the goal was to use the Soyuz
to move the space station

657
00:43:04,058 --> 00:43:08,695
in attitude about two axes;
we couldn't control about the roll axis

658
00:43:08,696 --> 00:43:11,111
because the moment was just too small.

659
00:43:11,112 --> 00:43:14,511
But about pitch and yaw of the Soyuz,

660
00:43:14,512 --> 00:43:17,127
we were going to try and move the station

661
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:19,698
to have a spin so that its solar arrays

662
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:22,916
pointed towards the Sun as we rotated

663
00:43:22,917 --> 00:43:25,732
in a fairly stable orientation.

664
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:27,954
As it turned out, that moment of inertia,

665
00:43:27,955 --> 00:43:30,130
that axis we were trying to spin about

666
00:43:30,131 --> 00:43:36,376
is the middle moment of inertia
of an irregular body

667
00:43:36,377 --> 00:43:44,780
and anyone who's studied
mechanics and kinematics at a high level

668
00:43:44,781 --> 00:43:48,220
will know that the middle moment
of inertia is unstable,

669
00:43:48,221 --> 00:43:50,700
and I suspected that at the time,
but we didn't know

670
00:43:50,701 --> 00:43:54,403
what the moments of inertia
were of the Mir station about those axes.

671
00:43:54,404 --> 00:43:59,878
What that meant was that we would spin
for about two orbits one way,

672
00:43:59,879 --> 00:44:02,477
basically getting some sunlight,

673
00:44:02,478 --> 00:44:05,254
and we were able to turn
the lights on and the fans were on,

674
00:44:05,255 --> 00:44:07,122
and we were able to talk to the ground,

675
00:44:07,242 --> 00:44:10,017
but then, after two orbits,
it would do a kind of a flip,

676
00:44:10,272 --> 00:44:15,552
and then it would face the other way
and <i>not</i> get any sunlight.

677
00:44:16,245 --> 00:44:19,643
And we'd go another two orbits
without any sunlight on the solar arrays,

678
00:44:19,644 --> 00:44:21,734
and then it would be to do another flip,

679
00:44:21,735 --> 00:44:24,411
and then we would get
sunlight on the arrays again.

680
00:44:25,890 --> 00:44:29,249
Then, by getting the batteries charged up,

681
00:44:29,450 --> 00:44:35,595
then we were able to talk to Moscow
over the Russian territory,

682
00:44:35,596 --> 00:44:37,252
over their ground sites,

683
00:44:37,253 --> 00:44:41,821
and the Russian Mir operators in Moscow

684
00:44:41,822 --> 00:44:46,972
were able to send commands
to activate the thrusters,

685
00:44:46,973 --> 00:44:50,175
the reaction control system thrusters
of the Mir station

686
00:44:50,176 --> 00:44:53,314
to actually stop the spin
that we put on it,

687
00:44:53,315 --> 00:44:58,531
and to then, slowly and methodically,

688
00:44:58,532 --> 00:45:03,508
get the solar arrays stable, pointed
and not spinning towards the Sun

689
00:45:03,509 --> 00:45:07,488
and from that point on, we were
basically in a recovered situation.

690
00:45:07,489 --> 00:45:09,683
However, the consequence of the collision

691
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:15,390
was that it created a hole
in the station at that moment,

692
00:45:15,929 --> 00:45:19,469
and Sasha and I, over a period
of about six minutes,

693
00:45:19,470 --> 00:45:24,172
had to disconnect large electrical cables

694
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:27,527
going to that module
that had been punctured.

695
00:45:27,528 --> 00:45:29,885
It was called the Spektr module,

696
00:45:29,886 --> 00:45:32,508
and as we're disconnecting those cables,

697
00:45:32,509 --> 00:45:36,895
we disconnected 30%
of the electrical power of the Mir

698
00:45:37,455 --> 00:45:40,287
so that power wasn't available at all,

699
00:45:40,288 --> 00:45:43,540
and as a result of that power cut,

700
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:50,711
two of the other modules had to be
completely left powered off

701
00:45:50,712 --> 00:45:55,428
and were cold and collecting
a lot of water as condensation,

702
00:45:55,429 --> 00:45:57,531
maybe two or three tons of water.

703
00:45:57,532 --> 00:46:02,172
Two or three cubic meters of water
were collecting in those modules

704
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:07,987
as we lived and made do
with the base block of the Mir station.

705
00:46:13,751 --> 00:46:19,465
Lazutkin and I had to disconnect
the Spektr solar power arrays

706
00:46:19,466 --> 00:46:22,476
so that we could put
a patch cover in place

707
00:46:22,477 --> 00:46:25,695
and stop the air leaving the space station
through that module.

708
00:46:27,156 --> 00:46:31,630
About three weeks later,

709
00:46:31,631 --> 00:46:34,544
another cargo ship was sent to us

710
00:46:34,623 --> 00:46:38,171
which docked
automatically and successfully,

711
00:46:38,172 --> 00:46:43,765
and it carried with it a plug
with cable pass-through plugs

712
00:46:43,766 --> 00:46:49,778
that allowed another crew 
that was sent up after Sasha and Vasily.

713
00:46:49,778 --> 00:46:51,960
I stayed onboard,

714
00:46:51,961 --> 00:46:55,843
but another Russian crew was sent up,
so I had two crews,

715
00:46:55,844 --> 00:47:00,451
and they performed an <i>inside</i> spacewalk

716
00:47:01,228 --> 00:47:06,315
to connect that hatch plug,
to connect up the cables

717
00:47:06,316 --> 00:47:09,491
that Sasha and I had disconnected
to save the space station.

718
00:47:10,858 --> 00:47:15,252
That was done about
two months after the collision,

719
00:47:15,253 --> 00:47:22,149
and then finally, I went outside
with Anatoly Solovyev, the Commander,

720
00:47:22,150 --> 00:47:26,757
to look for the damage
on the outside of the Spektr module.

721
00:47:27,552 --> 00:47:30,935
We could see the damage,
but we couldn't find the hole,

722
00:47:30,936 --> 00:47:33,489
and that was in September,

723
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:41,773
and just as the Space Shuttle
was coming to bring me home in October,

724
00:47:41,774 --> 00:47:46,299
I had worked to dry up all of the water

725
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:49,513
that was in the two modules
that had been powered off,

726
00:47:49,514 --> 00:47:55,692
and we were just preparing
to turn those modules back on,

727
00:47:55,693 --> 00:47:59,892
but that never happened while I was there.

728
00:47:59,893 --> 00:48:02,133
I think it happened after I left.

729
00:48:02,134 --> 00:48:06,124
To answer your question briefly,
about three months, at least.

730
00:48:14,076 --> 00:48:18,239
I wanted to be an astronaut
from the age of six, until, well, now.

731
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,540
(chuckles)

732
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:23,645
And my father was a Royal Air Force pilot

733
00:48:24,242 --> 00:48:31,585
and I was very impressed 
by the romance, the idea of flying.

734
00:48:32,641 --> 00:48:34,540
I loved watching birds.

735
00:48:34,541 --> 00:48:38,896
I had many, many aircraft models.

736
00:48:38,897 --> 00:48:43,203
When I learned about
the American space program

737
00:48:43,204 --> 00:48:46,912
and the goal of landing on the Moon,

738
00:48:46,913 --> 00:48:49,085
I was about six years old, man!

739
00:48:49,086 --> 00:48:52,406
I sort of told myself
I wanted to be an astronaut.

740
00:48:52,407 --> 00:48:54,788
At some point, I wanted
to cure cancer as well,

741
00:48:54,789 --> 00:48:56,817
because my uncle died of cancer,

742
00:48:56,818 --> 00:48:59,901
but that was my goal.

743
00:48:59,902 --> 00:49:05,804
The way I saw it happening was
to become a pilot in the Royal Air Force

744
00:49:05,805 --> 00:49:07,165
and become a test pilot,

745
00:49:07,165 --> 00:49:09,466
because that's the way 
all the astronauts had done

746
00:49:09,466 --> 00:49:12,341
as far as I knew, up to that point.

747
00:49:12,342 --> 00:49:16,508
But when I applied to the Royal Air Force
for the actual medical tests,

748
00:49:16,509 --> 00:49:19,540
I didn't pass the eye tests.

749
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:24,956
That meant-- I was devastated by this news

750
00:49:24,957 --> 00:49:27,072
and changed all of my plans.

751
00:49:27,073 --> 00:49:32,897
I was one of the rare boys who had an idea
of what he wanted to do when I grew up

752
00:49:32,898 --> 00:49:37,642
and all of a sudden, I thought I couldn't
do what I wanted to do when I grew up.

753
00:49:37,643 --> 00:49:41,529
However, I was always good
at physics and making model airplanes,

754
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:44,037
and I basically focused on that,

755
00:49:44,038 --> 00:49:48,963
and worked at the physics,
got to the University of Cambridge,

756
00:49:48,964 --> 00:49:51,793
studied physics at Cambridge,

757
00:49:51,794 --> 00:49:55,750
and when I was just about
to take my final exams

758
00:49:55,751 --> 00:49:58,878
as an undergraduate
in Physics at Cambridge,

759
00:49:58,879 --> 00:50:03,195
thinking I might be a geophysicist,
or a geologist, or something like that,

760
00:50:03,196 --> 00:50:09,398
I learned that the Space Shuttle program
was looking for scientist astronauts,

761
00:50:09,399 --> 00:50:12,437
and so I suddenly
became very, very focused

762
00:50:12,438 --> 00:50:17,608
on getting a really good physics
exam result as an undergraduate

763
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:20,182
so I could do the PhD in Physics

764
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,274
because I knew I needed the PhD in Physics

765
00:50:22,275 --> 00:50:24,820
to apply to be a scientist astronaut.
