Departure from a planet.
So, first of all, I need to give you some symbol conventions for position and velocity.
You have the planet here, you have the Sun here.
The radius vector from the center of the Sun to the planet is designated <i>R_P</i> vectorial.
And for the Spacecraft: the <i>S</i> means spacecraft, the radius vector from the Sun to the spacecraft is capital <i>R_S</i>.
Now, as far as the position of this spacecraft with respect to the planets, we use small <i>r</i>,
<i>S</i> for spacecraft, so the convention is, whatever is heliocentric, whether its position or velocity-- over here, the velocities-- we use capital letters and whatever is planetocentric, you use small letters, whether its for the position <i>r</i> vectorial or <i>v</i> vectorial, as you can see here.
So that's an important convention.
Now following the content of the last slide, we have the relationship between the heliocentric movement of the spacecraft--we have this here-- is equal to the planetocentric motion of the spacecraft
<i>plus</i> the heliocentric movement of the planet.
If the spacecraft enters this sphere of influence in case of the arrival of the target planet, then we have this set of relationships here.
Planetocentric movement of the planet is equal to the difference between the heliocentric movement of the spacecraft and the planets.
And this using the convention with the small letters and the big letters as we saw on the previous slide.
Departure from the planets.
We always start our journey to a destination in the solar system with a parking orbit of radius, small <i>r_d</i>, <i>d</i> for departure.
And at some point-- also it has to be pretty determined to be the right point of this orbit-- we increase the velocity, the orbital velocity, to get to a velocity which is called the departure velocity,
<i>V_d</i>.
And depending on the value of <i>V_d</i>, we're going to come possibly to an elliptical trajectory if <i>V_d</i> is less than the escape velocity for that altitude.
As we know the escape velocity depends on the altitude, it's about, for the Earth,
11.2 km per second from the surface of the Earth, but it becomes less and less as you go up.
Now, if you have the departure velocity amplitude equal to the escape velocity for that altitude, you're going to come on a parabolic orbit.
And if you have <i>V_d</i> larger than escape velocity, you come on hyperbolic orbits.
What is interesting on a hyperbolic orbit is that at some point, at a large distance from the Earth, you come to a certain velocity, constant velocity, which is called hyperbolic excess velocity.
In the case of the hyperbolic trajectory, if the departure velocity is larger than the escape velocity, you come to this hyperbola, and when you get close to the asymptote of the hyperbola, which is not a very large distance away from the Earth.
Then, you have a constant velocity and you're going to keep that constant velocity all the way to the infinity.
Let's look at reaching the sphere of influence.
The sphere of influence is really the place away from the departure planet, which is the Earth, for which you have a velocity across the surface of the sphere of influence with the velocity, which is pretty much the hyperbolic excess velocity, velocity that you will keep all the way to infinity.
Now, let's look at energy consideration.
First of all, we have here, the departure planet, which is the Earth, so here, we have <i>r_d</i>, the radius of the parking orbit.
This is here, the surface of the sphere of influence.
And at this point, on the parking orbit, you increase velocity to a value <i>v_d</i>, small <i>v</i>, because it's planetocentric, <i>v_d</i>.
And you get to come on that arc of hyperbolic trajectory that will allow you to cross the sphere of influence with the velocity <i>v</i> vectorial <i>d</i><i>_âˆž.</i>
The hyperbolic excess velocity.
Now, let's look at energy consideration.
The energy per unit mass, which we designate as <i>Îµ</i>,
<i>Îµ_{d âˆž}</i> is equal to
<i>v_d  âˆž</i> square over two, this is the kinetic energy,
<i>- (Î¼ / r)_ âˆž</i> the <i>r</i> being the radius of the sphere of influence.
Î¤his is going to be very small because the radius of the sphere of influence is so large that we are going to consider that this is zero.
So the energy per unit mass at that point is just equal to <i>v_d âˆž</i> square divided by two, only the kinetic energy.
Now, let's look at this point here, when we depart, the energy per unit mass.
Let's put <i>d</i> here, index <i>d</i> equal <i>v_d</i> square divided by two minus <i>Î¼ / r_d</i>, the potential energy.
Now, it happens that this <i>Î¼ / r_d</i> is equal to <i>v_Erd</i> square divided by two.
You remember that the escape velocity is equal to the square root of <i>2 Î¼ / r</i>, so this is it here, now if we put that energy is conserved, so...
Energy per unit mass <i>Îµ_{d âˆž}</i> equals energy per unit mass at the departure from the parking orbits, so... considering that this is zero here, it's going to give us <i>v_d âˆž</i> square divided by two, is equal to <i>v_d</i> square divided by two, minus <i>v_Erd</i> square divided by two.
You multiplied by two and you have an important relationship, which I'm going to write here:
<i>v_d âˆž</i> square equals <i>v_d</i> square minus <i>v_Erd</i> square.
That's a fundamental relationship between the departure velocity, or the amplitude of the departure velocity, the hyperbolic excess velocity here and the escape velocity from the initial parking orbit.
We'll use this expression quite often, because if we know the value of <i>v_d âˆž</i>, which we will know if we want to do a Hohmann transfer from the Earth in order to reach other planet or inner planet of the solar system, we will know the <i>v_d âˆž</i>, we will know also the escape velocity of the parking orbit, because we know the radius of the parking orbit, so it will allow us to determine the value of <i>v_d</i>, or how much we will have to increase the velocity on the parking orbit in order to get our motion towards the destination planet.
