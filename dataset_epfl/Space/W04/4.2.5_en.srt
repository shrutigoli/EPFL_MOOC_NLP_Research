1
00:00:05,896 --> 00:00:08,828
Let's summarize various steps 
of a journey

2
00:00:08,828 --> 00:00:13,498
from the Earth to another planet, 
let's say, the planet Mars.

3
00:00:13,498 --> 00:00:16,401
This is a summary 
of what we covered already

4
00:00:16,401 --> 00:00:18,611
in the previous videos.

5
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:24,563
We had to start 
with the heliocentric trajectory

6
00:00:24,563 --> 00:00:28,986
from the Earth
to the destination planet here

7
00:00:28,986 --> 00:00:31,768
and we had to consider 
that the sphere of influence

8
00:00:31,768 --> 00:00:36,787
of both the departure planet, the Earth, 
and the arrival planet, let's say, Mars,

9
00:00:36,787 --> 00:00:40,127
are very small compared to the scale 
of the solar system.

10
00:00:40,722 --> 00:00:45,682
So we have the transfer ellipse, 
pretty much Hohmann transfer

11
00:00:45,682 --> 00:00:52,131
from the supposedly circular trajectory 
of the departure planet, the Earth

12
00:00:53,556 --> 00:00:58,474
to the near-circular trajectory 
of the destination planet Mars.

13
00:00:58,474 --> 00:01:01,034
We just have a simplification here.

14
00:01:01,034 --> 00:01:04,864
Now, we start 
with that heliocentric trajectory.

15
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:11,579
We have the velocity of the Earth here, 
which we know, is about 30 km/s,

16
00:01:11,579 --> 00:01:14,009
heliocentric trajectory.

17
00:01:14,009 --> 00:01:17,998
Now, we know that 
in order to get this insertion

18
00:01:17,998 --> 00:01:23,576
to the elliptical transfer orbit 
of the destination planet

19
00:01:23,576 --> 00:01:25,509
we need to have a higher velocity,

20
00:01:25,509 --> 00:01:29,589
which I called <i>V_S departure</i>
for spacecraft departure.

21
00:01:30,179 --> 00:01:36,179
So the difference between <i>V_S departure</i>
and the Earth is <i>v_d∞</i>

22
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:40,966
which, in fact, is equal 
to what we call <i>V_1</i>

23
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:45,850
of a Hohmann transfer 
between two circular orbits.

24
00:01:49,026 --> 00:01:53,363
So it's really the supplement of velocity 
you need to give

25
00:01:53,363 --> 00:01:58,401
to the circular orbit
of the departure planet

26
00:01:58,401 --> 00:02:02,182
in order to get to that transfer velocity 
toward the destination planet.

27
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:05,528
Once we had <i>v_d ∞</i>,

28
00:02:07,318 --> 00:02:09,188
we have this here,

29
00:02:09,188 --> 00:02:12,511
we look now at what's happening 
in the sphere of influence

30
00:02:12,511 --> 00:02:14,581
of the departure planet, the Earth.

31
00:02:15,511 --> 00:02:17,433
On the basis of <i>v_d ∞</i>

32
00:02:17,433 --> 00:02:22,193
we can determine the value of <i>v_d</i>, 
the departure velocity

33
00:02:22,693 --> 00:02:25,520
from the parking orbit around the Earth

34
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,750
in order to get to our journey 
toward the destination planet.

35
00:02:29,536 --> 00:02:32,459
So, again, we start always 
with a heliocentric trajectory

36
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:34,923
from departure to destination planet,

37
00:02:34,923 --> 00:02:40,038
and then we can infer in what's happening 
inside the sphere of influence,

38
00:02:40,038 --> 00:02:42,668
again, small compared to the scale 
of the solar system

39
00:02:42,668 --> 00:02:45,133
for the departure planet.

40
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:47,113
We do the same thing for the arrival.

41
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:53,183
We have the velocity of the spacecraft 
at arrival, which is here.

42
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:56,651
We have the velocity 
of the destination planet,

43
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:00,723
which in our case is larger 
than the velocity at arrival.

44
00:03:00,723 --> 00:03:05,002
If we go to Mars and if we have 
this elliptical trajectory

45
00:03:05,002 --> 00:03:07,062
between the Earth and Mars,

46
00:03:07,062 --> 00:03:11,732
the semi-major axis 
of this elliptical transfer trajectory

47
00:03:11,732 --> 00:03:16,019
is smaller than the radius 
of the supposedly circular orbit of Mars.

48
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,920
So the energy is less,

49
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:20,164
so at that point, 
when we arrive at the planet,

50
00:03:20,164 --> 00:03:23,911
we have the same potential energy, 
we are at the same distance to the Sun,

51
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:26,731
so our kinetic energy is going to be less.

52
00:03:26,731 --> 00:03:28,771
So we arrive with default in velocity

53
00:03:28,771 --> 00:03:30,751
compared with the velocity to the planet.

54
00:03:30,751 --> 00:03:32,936
If you are on your spaceship 
arriving to Mars

55
00:03:32,936 --> 00:03:36,056
and you are looking in the direction 
of the velocity vector,

56
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:39,417
in fact, the planet 
will catch you up from behind.

57
00:03:39,417 --> 00:03:42,305
Your heliocentric velocity is less

58
00:03:42,305 --> 00:03:44,916
than the velocity 
of the destination planet.

59
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:46,855
I am talking now about an outer planet.

60
00:03:46,855 --> 00:03:49,775
If you go towards Mercury or Venus,
it's the contrary.

61
00:03:49,775 --> 00:03:53,302
You will arrive with a higher velocity 
than the velocity of the planet.

62
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:56,015
But, anyway, what is important, 
is the difference

63
00:03:56,015 --> 00:04:00,354
between the velocity of the planet 
and your velocity at arrival.

64
00:04:00,354 --> 00:04:02,894
It's <i>v_a ∞</i> and, again, at this point,

65
00:04:02,894 --> 00:04:07,024
after you have looked at the trajectory
from a heliocentric point of view,

66
00:04:08,667 --> 00:04:13,284
You can go to the boundary 
of the sphere of influence

67
00:04:13,284 --> 00:04:16,024
and you have <i>v_a ∞</i>, 
you will select the value

68
00:04:16,024 --> 00:04:17,464
we have seen that already

69
00:04:17,464 --> 00:04:20,194
<i>d_∞</i>, the impact parameter, and <i>θ</i>

70
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:24,702
to figure out whether you want 
to go on an equatorial orbit

71
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:26,333
around the destination planet,

72
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:28,563
or maybe a polar orbit orbit, 
or something in between

73
00:04:28,563 --> 00:04:31,566
or you want to do 
a direct impact on the planet,

74
00:04:31,566 --> 00:04:33,096
or you want to do only a flyby:

75
00:04:33,096 --> 00:04:35,786
you decide that as a flight controller.

76
00:04:35,786 --> 00:04:38,779
So you have <i>v_a ∞</i>, <i>d_∞</i> and <i>θ</i>,

77
00:04:38,779 --> 00:04:40,955
and this will determine your trajectory,

78
00:04:40,955 --> 00:04:43,653
hyperbolic trajectory 
inside the sphere of influence

79
00:04:43,653 --> 00:04:45,337
of the destination planet.

80
00:04:45,337 --> 00:04:49,636
And you will know on the basis of these 
what the value of <i>v_P</i> will be,

81
00:04:49,636 --> 00:04:53,417
the velocity of your spacecraft 
at the periapsis

82
00:04:53,417 --> 00:04:55,608
of your hyperbolic trajectory.

83
00:04:56,118 --> 00:04:59,349
That's it, you have completed 
your journey,

84
00:04:59,349 --> 00:05:02,636
and once you come to the periapsis,

85
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,383
you can decide what you want to do.

86
00:05:04,383 --> 00:05:05,503
We have seen already,

87
00:05:05,503 --> 00:05:08,908
if you want to come on an orbit 
around the destination planet,

88
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:10,665
you need to do a braking maneuver,

89
00:05:10,665 --> 00:05:13,625
you can possibly arrive 
in the higher layers of the atmosphere

90
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:14,966
of the destination planet,

91
00:05:14,966 --> 00:05:20,327
and you use that as <i>ΔV</i>
that will help you reduce your velocity

92
00:05:20,327 --> 00:05:22,672
to come on orbit 
around the destination planet.

93
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:25,030
That's it, you have completed 
your journey.

94
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,183
Let's look at some data 
for interplanetary trajectories,

95
00:05:28,183 --> 00:05:31,764
and we will consider in particular 
the case of Venus and the case of Mars.

96
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:35,794
So Venus: it's a journey 
toward an inner planet.

97
00:05:35,824 --> 00:05:40,694
This is the semi-major axis 
of the orbit of Venus,

98
00:05:40,694 --> 00:05:42,644
the semi-major axis of the orbit of Mars

99
00:05:42,644 --> 00:05:44,243
We have seen this already before.

100
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:48,039
Now, as far as the transfer 
orbit characteristics:

101
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:50,575
this is what we have for Venus and Mars.

102
00:05:50,575 --> 00:05:59,251
Obviously the perihelion 
of the transfer trajectory of Venus

103
00:05:59,251 --> 00:06:02,191
and the aphelion is at the Earth.

104
00:06:02,191 --> 00:06:04,565
And it's the contrary for Mars.

105
00:06:04,565 --> 00:06:09,605
The perihelion is at the Earth, 
and the aphelion is at Mars.

106
00:06:10,949 --> 00:06:17,129
Now, you know 
that the heliocentric Earth velocity

107
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,111
is about 30 km/s, 
and in order to go to Venus

108
00:06:22,111 --> 00:06:24,438
you need to reduce somewhat that velocity

109
00:06:24,438 --> 00:06:27,738
that's the heliocentric 
Earth departure velocity to go to Venus.

110
00:06:27,738 --> 00:06:30,904
That's why the Earth departure 
excess velocity,

111
00:06:30,904 --> 00:06:33,721
or hyperbolic excess velocity, 
is a negative value

112
00:06:33,721 --> 00:06:34,975
And in the case of Mars

113
00:06:34,975 --> 00:06:39,373
you have to increase the velocity 
of your spacecraft

114
00:06:39,373 --> 00:06:43,873
versus the velocity 
of the Earth around the Sun

115
00:06:43,873 --> 00:06:46,223
in order to achieve that transfer orbit

116
00:06:46,223 --> 00:06:50,253
outside of the orbit of the Earth 
towards Mars,

117
00:06:50,253 --> 00:06:53,418
and you see that the Earth 
departure excess velocity,

118
00:06:53,418 --> 00:06:55,278
or hyperbolic excess velocity,

119
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:57,798
is positive in the case of Mars.
